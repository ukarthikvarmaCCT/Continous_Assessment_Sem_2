 jo log sharabipan ke prati pehle se hi bahut samvedansheel hote hai, unamem ausat samay se pehle hi pinaa shuru karne kii adhik sambhaavna rahati he
 Genetic traits that influence the risk of developing alcoholism are associated with family history of alcoholism

 It has been hypothesized that this increased risk may be due to a highly sensitive developing adolescent brain that may alter the genetic state of the brain, which in turn prepares the adolescent for an increased risk of alcohol dependence
 sharaabiyon main se 40 pratishat kishoravastha ke antim daur main atyadhik sharaab pi rahe the
 Most alcoholics develop alcoholism during adolescence or young adulthood
 bachapan kaa gambhir maansik aghat bhi sharaab ke vaardhik jokhim yaa anya nasha sambandhi samasyaon se judaa he
 This is evidence that a complex combination of genetic factors as well as ambient factors, such as childhood stressful events, affect the risk of developing alcoholism
 jo jin sharaab ke chayapachay ko prabhavit karte hai, ve sharabipan ke jokhim ko bhi prabhavit karte hai
 The support of good peers and family helps prevent the risk of alcoholism from increasing
 sharaab ke seven ke niyantran kii haani kaa pataa lagane ke liye kai upkarnon kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 These tools are mostly self-reported in questionnaire form
 ek anya aam vishay ek score yaa teli he jo sharaab ke seven kii samanya gambhirtha kaa sankshipt vivaran prastut karata he
 Two "yes" responses indicated that the respondent should be investigated further
 The questionnaire asks the following questions: Psychiatric geneticists John I
 Nernberger Jr
 and Laura Jean Biratt suggest that alcoholism is not the only cause — including genetic — but that jeans "play an important role" by affecting processes in the body and brain that preserve Or establish contact with each other and with the person's life experiences to produce sensitivity
 " ve yah bhi soochna dete hai ki ek darjan se bhi kam sharabipan sambandhi genes kii pahchaan kii gai he, lekin abhi bhi bahut khoj hone kii sambhaavna he
 There is at least one genetic test for alleles that correlate with alcoholism and opiate intoxication
 maanav dopamine abhigraahak genes main ek pataa lagane yogya bhinnata hoti he jise DRD2 taiq-ai bahurupata ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 People who have the A1 allele of this polymorphism have a slightly lower but significant tendency towards endorphin-releasing drug addiction, like opiates and alcohol
 haalanki yah elil sharaabiyon or opiyat kaa nasha karne waalon main thodaa zyada aam he, lekin yah apane aap main sharabipan kaa ek paryaapt bhavishyavaktaa nahin he or kuch shodhakartaaon kaa tark he ki DRD2 kaa saboot bahes kaa mudda he
 Identification of the disease by the DSM-IV of alcohol dependence offers an approach to the definition of alcoholism
 kuch had tak yah shodh protocolon ke vikaas main sahaayta karata he jisamen nishkarshon kii ek duusare ke saath tulana kii ja sakati he
 According to DSM-IV, alcohol dependence is a hallmark of: sharaab ke sahi seven ke liye kai vishwasaneey pareekshan hai jinamein se rakt sharaab saamagree kaa pareekshan ek aam pareekshan he
 These tests do not establish differences between alcoholics and non-alcoholics; However, drinking too much for a long time has some identifiable effects on the body, including: haalanki, jaivik chihnakon ke liye inamen se koi bhi rakt pareekshan utana samvedansheel nahin hota he jitna jaanch prashnawali hoti he
 Since alcohol abuse disorders are seen as an impact on society as a whole, the World Health Organization, the European Union and other regional bodies, the country's governments and lawmakers have aimed to reduce the harm caused by alcoholism
 Have created policies
 kishoron or yuva vayaskon ko lakshya banane vaale sharaab yaa nashile padaarthon par nirbharta ke parinamswaroop praapt hone vaale swasthya, saamaajik or shaikshik adho-uplabdhi se nipatane ko sharaab kii lat se hone vaale nuksaan ko kam karne kaa ek mahatvapurn upaay mana jaataa he
 The age at which drugs such as alcohol can be purchased is recommended to prohibit or limit alcohol advertising as additional measures to reduce alcohol dependence and harm from addiction
 sharaab or anya nashile padaarthon kii lat ke parinaamon ke bare main jansanchaar ke madhyamon se vishwasaneey or saboot par aadhaarit shaikshik abhiyaan chalaane kii bhi sifarish kii gai he
 Also suggested to instruct parents about alcohol and drug abuse during adolescence and to target young people suffering from mental health problems to prevent harm from alcohol and other drug addiction has gone
 sharabipan ke ilaaj main kaaphi bhinnata he kyonki is sthiti ke liye khud kai drushtikon hai
 People who see alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend treatment differently than those who, for example, see the condition as one of social choice
 
 adhikansh ilaaj logon ko apane sharaab ke seven ko band karne main madad karne par kendrit hai, jiske baad unhen sharaab ke prayog par punah lautne se rokane main unki madad karne ke liye jivan prashikshan or / yaa saamaajik samarthan pradaan kii jaati he
 Because alcoholism has many factors that encourage a person to continue drinking alcohol, all of these factors must be noted to successfully prevent relapse
 An example of this type of treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of adjuvant therapy, presence in self-supporting groups and ongoing development of coping mechanisms
 sharabipan kaa ilaaj samudaay aam taur par sanyam-aadhaarit shunya sahansheeltaa vaale drushtikon kaa samarthan karata he; haalanki, aise bhi kuch log hai jo ek haani-avnati drushtikon ko bhi badhaava dete hai
 Alcohol detoxification or "detoxification" of alcoholics is an accidental stoppage of alcohol consumption coupled with drug replacement, such as benzodiazepines, which have similar effects of preventing withdrawal from alcohol
 jin vyaktiyon ko keval halki se madhyam vaapasi ke lakshanon kaa khatra he, unka vishharan bahari-marijon ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 Individuals who are at risk of severe withdrawal syndrome, as well as those who suffer from a significant or acute hyper-unhealthy condition, are usually treated as hospitalized patients
 haalanki, vishharan vastav main sharabipan kaa ilaaj nahin karata he
 Therefore, in order to reduce the risk of recurrence, it is necessary to take appropriate treatment programs along with detoxification
 vishharan ke baad, un anternihit manovaigyaniki muddon se nipatane ke liye samooh chikitsa yaa manochikitsa ke vibhinn roopon kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he jo sharaab kii lat ke saath-saath punaravartan kii rokthaam ke kaushal ko pradaan karne se sambandhit hote hai
 The approach of mutual-assisted group-counseling is one of the most common ways to help alcoholics to maintain abstinence
 sambhaajan or pariniman kaaryakramon, jaise - moderation management or drinkwaiz, main sampoorn sanyam anivaary nahin he
 While most alcoholics are unable to limit their drinking habits in this manner, some adopt a regulated intake route

 Alcohol itself is a sedative-hypnotic fluid and is a tolerant to other sedative-hypnotic substances, such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines
 anya shaamak nidrajanak padaarthon, jaise - zolpidem or zopiclone ke saath-saath opiots or gaiyr-kanoonee davaaiyaan, par nirbharta sharaabiyon main aam he
 The dependence on and relieving sedative hypnotics, such as relieving benzodiazepines, is similar to alcoholism and can be medically severe and if not properly administered, it is also at risk of seizures and psychosis

 For example, the American Medical Association considers alcohol a drug and states that "drug addiction is a chronic recurrent brain disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, often with disastrous consequences

" Velant also commented that "as reported in short-term studies, withdrawal of controlled drinking is often an illusion
 " The term "drunkenness" was first used by the Swedish physician Magnus Huss in 1849 to describe the systemic adverse effects of alcohol

 According to biology, the morphology of women's alcohol intake differs significantly from that of men in several important ways
 unhen sharaab ke seven se shaareerik prabhaavon kii ek doordarshita kaa anubhav hota he
 Equal doses of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in very high blood alcohol concentrations in women
 iske liye kai kaarnon ko jimmedaar tehraaya ja saktaa he, jisamen se mukhya kaaran yah he ki mahilaon ke sharir main purushon kii tulana main kam pani hota he
 Therefore, a given amount of alcohol is concentrated too much in a woman's body
 is tathy ke alaava, mahilaon ko zyada nasha ho saktaa he, aisa alag hormone srav ke kaaran hota he
 Women develop long-term complications of alcohol dependence much faster than men
 iske atirikt, purushon kii tulana main mahilaon ke sharabipan kii vajah se hone vaali maut kii dar adhik he
 Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart and liver damage and a high risk of getting breast cancer
 iske atirikt, yah bhi pataa chalaa he ki adhik samay tak bahut zyada sharaab ke seven se mahilaon ke prajnan kriyasheeltaa par nakaaratmak prabhaav padataa he
 It results in reproductive dysfunction such as ovulation, reduced ovarian mass, irregular menstruation, rheumatism, coronary stage dysfunction and early menopause

 This is true for both men and women, although the disorders vary by gender

 mahilaon or sharaab ke prati nazariye or saamaajik dharanaen mahila sharaab sevankaariyon kaa pataa lagane or unka ilaaj karne baadhaaen utpann kar sakati hai
 Such perceptions stigmatize drinking women who are characterized as "generally immoral both in terms of sex and gender" or "fallen women"
 kalankikaran kaa dar mahilaon ko apane pine kii baat ko chupaane or akele pine ke liye is baat se inkaar karne par vivash kar saktaa he ki ve log ek chikitsiya sthiti se peedit hai
 This method, in turn, reduces the likelihood of family, doctors and others suspecting that the woman they know is an alcoholic
 iske vipareet, purushon or sharaab ke prati nazariye or saamaajik dharanaen purush sharaab sevankaariyon kii pahchaan or ilaaj ke liye kam baadhaaen utpann kar sakati hai
 Such notions regard drinking men as "generally and gender-oriented in both moral" or "advanced men"
 kalank kaa kam dar purushon ko apane pine kii aadat kaa khuleam pradarshan karne or samooh main pine ke liye is baat ko sweekaar karne par vivash kar detaa he ki ve ek chikitsiya sthiti se guzar rahe hai
 This method, in turn, increases the likelihood of family, physicians, and others suspecting that the man they know is an alcoholic
 mahilaon main bhi is baat ko lekar bahut zyada dar kaa bhav hota he ki kalank kaa nakaaratmak prabhaav unke pariwaron par bahut bura prabhaav daalega
 yah unhen madad maangane se bhi dur rakh saktaa he
 Research has indicated a lack of adequate training for physicians in both situations involving general problematic alcohol use and women's issues

 Better education and awareness related to the gender implications of alcoholism will help care providers in treating women suffering from alcoholism in an adequate manner
 Early intervention will also increase the chances of recovery

 In addition, waterways traffic has also been arranged through the canal

 The main among them are: Prevention of floods, making adequate waterway facilities by rivers, construction of large dams and generation of hydroelectricity by them, providing means of irrigation of water irrigated by dams, control of water erosion and prevent land erosion
 Performing a variety of terrestrial works for conservation, forest conservation and proper division and control of forest and agricultural land, fisheries products Management of food and its distribution, care of animals and birds and organizing their growth, prevention of other diseases like malaria etc

 Due to this construction, the natural form of the valley changed

 Therefore, the creation of Nadiaghati schemes is a progressive tactic, by which the coordination of various votes is coordinated under one administration

 Nadighati schemes require a lot of engineering capability in execution and operation

 Velupillai Prabhakaran was the leader of the LTTE
 1975 ke aasapaas littey ke gathan ke baad se wo duniya ke sabase taqatvar gorilla ladaakaon ke pramukh ke rup main janaa jaataa tha
 On 18 May 2009, the Sri Lankan army claimed to have killed him
 prabhakaran kaa janm 26 navambar 1954 ko srilanka ke jafana dweep ke samudratati nagar velvettithurai main hua tha
 He was the fourth and youngest child of his parents
 prabhakaran padhai main ausat darje kaa tha
 As a child, she was shy and clinging to books
 srilanka main pruthak ilam kii maang ko lekar pichley teen dashak tak nirmam andolan chalaane vaala velupillai prabhakaran ek pakkaa ladaaka tha, lekin uske virdohi use ek aise mahatvakankshi ke rup main dekhte the jisane asantushton ko kabhi sahan nahin kiya
 Prabhakaran, notorious as 'thambi', was the fourth child of a government official who left school as a child
 prabhakaran, nepolian va sinkadar mahaan se bahut prabhavit tha or usne unki kai kitabon ko padhaa tha
 This was revealed by Prabhakaran in an interview
 inke alaava prabhakaran subhash chandra bose or bhagat singh se bhi bahut prabhavit tha
 Both these Indian leaders believed in violent struggle against British rule
 raajnneeti, rojgaar or shiksha main tamilon ke saath bhed-bhav se aahat prabhakaran ne raajnneetik baithkon main bhaag lenaa shuru kiya or marshall art kaa prashikshan praapt kiya
 
 shri lanka main tamil hindu jo ki alpsankhyakah he or isai bahusankhyak rahete hai
 Till date, Tamil Hindus have not got the right to vote in Sri Lanka
 yahan tak ki shri lanka ke savidhan main saafe taur par likhaa he ki tamil hindu duusare darje ke naagarik he
 If we start telling cow atrocities on Tamil Hindus, then our page will be closed at this time
 aap kalpana kijiye kitna bhayanak rup se tamilo kaa katleam kiya gaya hoga
 In protest against this atrocity, Valipilai Prabhakaran created the LTTE {liberson Tiger of Tamil Ilm}
 hindu tamilo ke saamne sirf do hi raste batch gay the, ek isaayiyo ke atyaachaaro kaa shikaar banakar bujdil ki maut maro or dusraa rasta swabhimaan ke khatir ladate hue maut ko gale laga lo
 The Hindu Tamils chose another route and waged war with Sri Lanka, supporting Prabhakaran
 shruwati dashako main littey ko jabardast kamyaabi mili or aanshik rup se shri lanka haar tak maan lee thi
 That is when our very ex-prime Minister Shri Rajiv Gandhi intervenes and helps Sri Lanka army, yes he heard right, India helps the Christians and waging war against Prabhakaran
 jiske jawaab main prabhakaran, rajeev gandhi ki hatya karvaa dete hai
 If Prabhakaran had been given a little support at that time, then Hindu Tamils would have had a different country and would not have to live with Sri Lanka
 kyunki tab tamilo kaa desh hamaare saath khadaa hota
 Even today the situation of Tamil Hindus in Sri Lanka is pathetic
 srilanka ke purvottar kshetra main ek chote se kasbe main thambi kaa udai hua or tamilon ke liye alag 'grihabhumi' kii maang ko puraa karne ke liye usne 1972 main kuch yuvakon ke ek samooh ke saath 'tamil new tiger' kii shuruyaat kii
 He led this group
 1975 main is samooh kaa naam badal kar libration tigers of tamil ilam rakh diya gaya
 The group became more aggressive after the infamous Vellikade prison massacre
 is narsanhaar main algaavvaadi netaa kuttamani or jagan ko sena ne maar diya tha
 Under Prabhakaran's leadership, the world first became aware of the suicide squad, which was also victimized by former Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi
 prabhakaran kii pahchaan ek nirbhik chhapamar ladaake ke rup main thi
 Always equipped with realities and uniforms, Prabhakaran soon emerged as an inspiration to the Tamil rebels
 samarthakon ke liye swatantraaa senaanee tathaa anya logon ke liye durdaat ladaake ke rup main kukhyat prabhakaran aatankwaad, hatya or sangathit aparaadh ke liye 1990 se interpol or anya sanghathanon ko vaanchit tha
 Prabhakaran preferred to be on the battlefield rather than talking at the negotiating table, so when Norwegian mediation broke out in 2002, Prabhakaran used it to organize the LTTE
 parantu sangharsh viraam tikaoo sabit nahin hua or varsh 2003 se varsh 2008 ke bich prabhakaran ko kai jatke lage
 In 2004, Colonel Karuna, once considered Prabhakaran's right hand man, split from him
 do varsh baad altitii kii raajnneetik shakha ke pramukh anton balasingham kii landan main mrityu ho gai
 Balasingham was suffering from cancer
 november 2007 main sena kii bambaari main varisht tamil vidrohi netaa espi tamilchelvam maaraa gaya
 Prabhakaran, who was fighting against the majority Sinhalese regime, was considered a Tamil, freedom fighter, on the other hand, the Sri Lankan government and army considered him a cruel assassin, for whom human life had no value
 varsh 1975 main un par jafana ke meyar kii hatya kaa aarope laga
 This was the first major action by the Tamil rebels
 tamil ilam ke sangharsh main anek sinhalai or tamil netaaon samet 70 hajaar se adhik logon ne praan ganvaae gai
 Former Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi also succumbed to this terrorism
 prabhakaran sinhalai netaaon raashtrapati premadas, damini dishanayake or ranjan vijayratne tathaa udaaravaadi tamil netaaon appapillai, amirtalingam, yogeshwaran or unki patni tathaa videsh mantri lakshaman kaadirgamar kii hatya kaa uttaradaayi tha

 The Golden Bridge connects Ankleshwar to Bharuch in the Indian state of Gujarat
 yah 1881 main britishon dwaara banaaya gaya tha, jinhen bombay main vyapaar or prashasan ke adhikariyon ke liye behatar pahunch banane ke liye narmada nadi ke paar ek pul kii jarurat thi
 The bridge is also known as Narmada Bridge
 british ne 7 disambar 1877 ko pul kaa nirmaan karne ke liye kaam shuru kiya tha
 This bridge was constructed on 16 May 1881 at a cost of Rs 45
65 lakh and was called Narmada Bridge

 Animal epidemics or rinderpest was a viral infectious disease caused by animals which has now been eliminated from the world

 Animals suffering from this disease used to see symptoms like fever, diarrhea, dripping saliva from the mouth, etc

 Tapasya tapa originally meant light or ignition which was evident in the sun or fire
 kintu dhire-dhire uskaa ek roodharth viksit ho gaya or kisi uddeshy vishesh kii prapti athwa atmik or shaareerik anushaasan ke liye uthaae janevaale daihik ksht ko tap kaha jane laga
 In fact, the development of the spirit of asceticism was the result of the development of the doctrine of the four Purusartho and the four Ashramas
 ye sabhi vichaar uttar vaidic yug kii hi dein hai or yadi rugveda main tapas kaa koi vishesh ullekh na mili to isamen aashcharya nahin
 Yes, that form of tapas, which is tantric and guhyak and whose purpose is to harm another or to protect oneself from the attack of another, the Shudra must be affected by the non-aryan elements
 mulat: moksh kii prapti kaa icchhuk sanyasi hi tapascharya main rat hua
 His discussions begin in Brahmins and Upanishads and attainment of Brahm becomes his objective
 sarvaswatyag uske liye aavashyak mana gaya or yah samajha jane laga ki sansar main avaagaman ke bandhanon se mukt hone ke liye vairaygy hi nahin naitik jivan bhi aavashyak he
 Therefore, not only the renunciation of all the comforts of life, the body also started burning or tormenting it in many ways
 kuch videshi vidvan tapasya main nihit vichaaron ko arya or vaidic na maanakar avaidic adivaasiyon kii dein maanate hai
 But this does not seem right
 anarya or avaidic tatv dhire-dhire vaidic samaaj ke shudra varg main samahit ho gaye, jinhen tapasya kaa adhikaar pracheen dharm or samaaj ke netaaon ne diya hi nahin
 Even ascetic Shudras like Shambuk, who were doing the opposite, were punished
 yadi tapas kii vichaardhaara kaa prarambh un anarya tatwon se hua hota to yah paristhiti asambhav hoti
 a variety of forms and forms of austerity were considered due to differences in motives
 vidyadhyaayi brahmacharee, putrakalatra, dhansampatti tathaa aihik sukhon ke icchhuk grihasth, paramatma kii prapti, brahm se leen or mokshalabh kii ichha se prerit sanyasi manobhilashit var athwa stri chaahanewaale vyakti, bhagwaan main leen bhakt evam devidevataaon kii krupa chaahanewaale sarsaadhaaran stripurush, swadharm or saadhaaran dharm kaa paalan karne vaale saadhaaran jan aadi anek prakaar ke log bhinn bhinn roopon main tapas kaa sinddhant maanate or uskaa prayog karte
 The center of asceticism was to torment the body
 uske jitne hi bahuvidh rup hue athwa kathorta badi, tapas kaa utana hi charmotkarsh mana gaya
 The ordinary ascetic was limited only to the practice of vatkālādā ,ā, bhātīैयाāya, snacking, jātāgādā, नa, nā ,hādhā वेa, vedocharan, yajnākāvikā औरa, and kindness, but in the hot summer heat, panchagni, revelation in the rain, jalānivāsa in winter, or living in wet clothes, Three times bathing, Kandamulashan, begging, abstaining from the habitation and giving up all the comforts of the body and giving it trouble, is a symptom of penance Did not know shiv ko praapt karne ke liye parvati kii tapasya iskaa pramukh udhaaharan he
 Not only this, with one posture, namely - holding hands, walking or wearing other metaphors of the same kind - maintaining it for a few days or a lifetime, Tama's climax started to be considered
 aaj bhi aise anek tapasvi or hathyogi bharatvarsh ke sabhi konon, visheshat: tirthon, ashramon, nadi ke kinaaron or parvaton kii kandaraon main milenge
 The general public and sometimes the intelligent but also faithful and respectable society, have been respecting such ascetics and have also believed in emanating any superhuman or spiritual power
 kintu samalochak buddhi se yukt buddhijivi varg ne usapar kitni aasthaa rakhi he yah kah sakna kathin he
 The people of Western countries recognize that the Pauravayas have an infinite capacity to absorb suffering and physical heat and try to rise above or avoid it by torturing themselves in retaliation for subjugation, material tyranny and injustice
 shopenhaar ke man se isi kaaran purv ke deshon main ek nirashavad or dukhwad kaa janm hua, jiske parilakshan the sansar kaa tyaag, sanyas, sadhu jivan, sharir ko ksht dena or ichchhaaon ke daman kii aprakritik or amanovaigyanik pravriti
 But it seems that these thinkers do not pay as much attention to the prophetic psychological and pure physical analysis behind the accomplishment of meaning in the goals of Indian life, as in the sense of self-reliant salvation and its attainment
 isi drushti se tap kaa jo saamaajik vishleshan manusmriti main miltaa he vah chintya he
 Accordingly, the tenacity theology of the Chaturvarnayas is prescribed by their karma, such as the attainment of knowledge through Brahman, the protection of society through Kshatriya, agriculture, cow protection and commerce through Vaishya and service of the two-nation through Shudra
 saamaajik dashti se yah swadharm- apane kartavyon kaa paalan - hi sabamein mahatvapurn tap tha
 In the Bhagavad Gita, the philosophical aspect of asceticism and asceticism is seen as the best and its physical, speech and mental and satvic, majestic and tamasic forms are described
 shaareerik tap dev, dwij, guru or ahimsa main nihit hota he, vaachik tap anudvegkar vaani, satya or priybhaashan tathaa swadhyay se hota he or maansik tap man kii prasannataa, saumyata, aatmanigrah or bhavasanshuddhi se siddh hota he
 Along with this, there is a perfect sattvik which is done devotionally with the desire of fruit
 iske vipareet satkar, maan or puja ke liye dambhpurvak kiya janevaala rajas tap athwa mudhatavash apane ko anek ksht dekar duusare ko ksht pahunchaane ke liye jo bhi tap kiya jaataa he, vah adarsh nahin
 It is clear that in Indian asceticism, attainment of eternal values of life has been given the highest position and Nishkam Karma is considered to be its greatest path

 yah lekh martin luther ke bare main he
 Martin Luther King or 'martin Luther King Jr
' is a different person
 martin luther isaai dharm main protestwad naamak sudharatmak aandolan chalaane ke liye vikhyath hai
 He was a German monk, theologian, university professor, pastor and church reformer whose ideas led to the Protestism Reform movement that changed the course of development of Western Europe
 luther kaa janm germany kii islevan naamak nagari main hua tha
 His father was a laborer of Hans Luther Khan, who had a total of eight children in his family and Martin was his second child
 attharah varsh kii avasthaa main martin luther erfurt ke nae vishvavidhyalay main bharti hue or san 1505 main unhen em
e
 kii oopaadhi mili
 After this, he started studying law according to his father's will, but considering a risk in his life in a severe storm, he vowed to retire
 iske falswaroop vah san 1505 main hi sant agastin ke sanyasiyon ke dharmasangh ke sadsy bane or 1507 i
 main unhen purohit kaa abhishek diya gaya
 Luther's officer sent him to the University of Wittenberg for the purpose of becoming president of his union, where Luther received his doctorate in theology in 1512 AD
 usee vishvavidhyalay main vah bible ke professor bane or saath saath apane sangh ke prantiy adhikari ke pad par bhi niyukt hue
 Luther soon began to interpret the Bible based on personal spiritual experiences in his lectures
 us samay unke ant:karan main gahari ashaanti vyaapt thi
 Finding himself incapable of fulfilling the ordinances ordained by God, he began to teach that human nature was completely distorted due to Adipaap
 carch kii paramparaagat shiksha yah thi ki baptism dwaara manushya adipaap se mukt ho jaataa he kintu luther kii dharna thi ki baptism sanskaar ke baad bhi manushya paapi hi rah jaataa he or dharmik kaaryon dwaara koi bhi punya nahin arjeet kar sata at: use isa par bharosa rakhana chahie
 a sinful human being, as a result of a full surrender to Jesus, becomes a blessing to God even when he is a sinner
 ye vichaar carch kii shiksha ke anukool nahin the kintu san 1517 i tak luther ne khulmakhulla carch ke prati vidroh kiya
 To understand the events of 1517, it is necessary to understand the theology of "dandamochan"
 carch kii tatsambandhi paramparaagat shiksha is prakaar he - sachche papasvikaar dwaara paap kaa aparaadh kshamaa kiya jaataa he
 But not all the consequences of sin are destroyed
 uske parinaam dur karne ke liye manushya ko tapasya karnaa athwa dand bhogana padataa he
 The church can help a sinner to overcome those consequences of sin
 vah uske liye prarthana kar saktaa he or isa or apane punya falon ke bhandar main se kuch ansh paapi ko pradaan kar saktaa he
 That support of the church is called Indulgance or Dandamochan
 paapi koi "dandamochan" tabhi mil saktaa he jab vah paap sweekaar karne ke baad paap ke aparaadh se mukt ho chukaa ho tathaa us dandamochan ke liye carch dwaara tehraaya hua punya kaa kaary puraa kare
 In 1517 AD, a special chastisement was announced in favor of those who supported the construction of Rome's Saint Peter the Great Temple
 us dandamochan kii ghoshnaa karanevaale kuch upadeshak paap ke liye pashchaattap karne kii aavashyaktaa par kam bal dete the or rupaya ikattha karne kaa adhik dhyaan rakhte the
 Luther rebelled against the same sentencing
 unhone dandamochan vishyak durupyog kii ninda hi nahin kii, dandamochan ke siddhant kaa bhi virodh karte hue vah khullamakhulla sikhalaane lage ki carch athwa pope paap ke parinaamon se chhutkaaraa de hi nahin sakate, isa maatr de sakate hai
 Jesus does not punish people who hate their sins because of their own merit, but because of their mercy
 rome kii ore se luther se anurodh hua ki vah dandamochan ke vishay main apni shiksha waapas le kintu luther ne aisa karne se inkaar kiya or teen nai rachanaaon main apni dharanaon ko spasht kar diya
 He opposed the authority of Rome and the practice of priests being unmarried, Christianity accepted no other basis except the Bible, and accepted only three sacraments, namely, baptism, sin, and the Eucharist
 uttar main rome ne san 1520 i
 main katholic carch se luther ke bahishkaar kii ghoshnaa kii
 From that time onwards Luther began to lead his new sect
 san 1524 i
 main unhone catherine bora se vivaah kiya
 His movement was not free from the feeling of German nationality and he received the support of most of the German rulers
 sambhavat: is kaaran se unhone apane sampradaay kaa sanghathan jarurat se adhik shaskaon par chhod diya
 When the Catholic Emperor Charles v requested the Lutheran rulers to allow the Catholic Christians of their territories to perform public worship, the Lutheran rulers sent an intense counter-protest to the emperor in protest of the proposal and the emperor had to bow down
 is pratwaad ke kaaran us nae dharm kaa naam protestat rakhaa gaya tha
 Luther's place is very important in the history of Western Christianity
 roman katholic carch ke prati unke vidroh ke falswaroop yadhyapi paashchaatya isai sampradaay kii ekta shatabdiyon ke liye chhin bhinn ho gai thi or aaj tak aisi hi he kintu isse inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki luther asaadhaaran pratibhasampann vyakti the jinhone sachche dharmik bhaavon se prerit hokar vidroh kii aawaaj uthaai thi
 Luther's importance in the field of language is also unique
 unhone german bhashaa main bahut se bhavpurn bhajanon kii rachana kii tathaa bible kaa german anuwaad bhi prastut kiya jisase aadhunik german bhashaa par luther kii amit chhap he
 After his separation from the Catholic Church, Luther spent much of his life in Wittenberg where he lectured at the university and created a majority of his works on theology and the Bible
 san 1546 i
 main vah kisi vivaad kaa samaadhaan karne ke uddeshy se mansfeld gaye the or vahaan se lautate hue vah apane janmasthan icelyban main hi chal based
 At the time of his death, all Germany except Westphalia, Rheinlad and Bavaria was in the hands of the Lutheran rulers
 iske atirikt luutherwaad germany ke nikatavarti deshon main bhi fail gaya tathaa scandinavia ke samast isai lutheran ban gaye the
 Nowadays, twenty-nine percent of all Protestat religions, including the Anglican community, are Lutherans
 luutherwaad kaa pradhan centre germany hi he jahaan baawan pratishat log lutheran hai
 More than ninety percent of people in Scandinavian countries are followers of the same religion, there are about ten million Lutherans in other nearby countries of Germany, with a figure of six million in North America

 Feudalism was the practice of England and Europe in the medieval era
 in saamanton kii kai shreniyan thim jinke sheersh sthaan main raja hota tha
 Below him were various types of feudatories and the lowest level consisted of peasants or slaves
 yah rakshak or adhinsth logon kaa sanghathan tha
 The king was considered the lord of the entire land
 samantgan raja ke prati swamibhakti baratate the, uski raksha ke liye sena susajjit karte the or badale main raja se bhoomi pate the
 The feudal lords were not authorized to buy and sell land
 praarambhik kaal main samantvaad ne sthaneey suraksha, krishi or nyaay kii samuchit vyavastha karke samaaj kii prashansaneey seva kii
 Later, personal war and personal selfishness became the objective of the feudal lords
 saadhan-sampann nae shaharon ke utthan, barood ke avishkaar, tathaa sthaneey rajbhakti ke sthaan par rashtrabhakti ke udai ke kaaran samantshahi kaa lop ho gaya
 
 europe main samantvaad kaa vikaas saamanytah in paristhitiyon main hua
 After the breakup of the Roman Empire, it was captured by the uncivilized castes of Western Europe - Frank Lombard and the Goths
 in luteri jatiyon ne samaaj or sarkaar ko sarvatha naveen rup diya
 By the fifth century the Roman Empire had become unable to defend itself
 german kii barbar jatiyon ke akraman ke kaaran italy ke gaanv asurakshit se ho gaye the, kyonki sarkaar suraksha karne main samarth nahin thi jiske parinamswaroop janata ne apni suraksha ke liye shaktishaalee varg se samjhauta kiya
 These powerful classes later became the basis of feudalism
 inacychlopedia britanika main bhi suraksha kii aavashyaktaa par vishesh bal diya gaya he
 According to him, "in the birth of feudalism, the sense of security was predominant
 sambhavit videshi akraman tathaa sarkari afasaron kii aniyantrit maangon se chhutkaare ke liye ek aisi satta kii aavashyaktaa anubhav kii ja rahi thi, jo unhen kisi bhi keemat par suraksha pradaan kar sake
 '' europe main samantvaad ke udai ke peeche ek or jabardast kaaran rahaa hai
 Due to the remote expansion of the empire, the emperor was unable to operate the entire empire smoothly
 isliye satta kaa vikendrikaran ho gaya jo aavashyak kaary hone ke saath loktantr kii disha main ek kadam tha
 Gradually, this powerful class which provided security to the people, ie feudalism, spread throughout Europe
 uskaa kendra caroligian samrajya main tha
 From there he reached East Germany and Denmark through the Holy Roman Empire
 dakshini france main samantvaad kaa prabhaav spain par padaa
 Later feudalism appears in its flourishing form in France
 naraman vijay ke falswaroop dakshini italy or england bhi iske purna prabhaav main aa gaye
 In this way, a new system was introduced in the whole of Europe and this new system was called feudalism which dominated the whole of Europe from about the eighth century to the thirteenth century

 Under this practice, the peasants were tied to the land and the landowners were the zamindars who worked as the link between the real tenants and the king

 bhandari bhi ‘‘samtanvaad ko samvedatmak sarkaar kaa ek rup maanate he jisamen samant madhyasthata kaa kaam karte the
 While affirming some of these grounds, Dr
 Satish Chandra opined that "feudalism in Europe was related to two systems, one of which was the agricultural slave system and the other was the military organization
 ’’ is aadhaar par krishi daasatv evam sainik sanghathan donon samantvaad ke mukhya aadhaar he
 On the basis of this analysis, it can be said that feudalism was an administrative system based on decentralization related to the land system in Europe in which feudal was the bridge between the supreme power and the peasants, which were connected to both the parties through fixed contracts
 europe main rajya seva karne ke puraskaar swaroop saamanton ko bhoomi di jaati thi or un saamanton kii prashasnic dekh-rekh main jitna kshetra hota tha, uskaa puraa rajasav unheen ko praapt hota tha kintu vah apane adhinsth logon ke praapt kar main se apane prabhu ko niyamit rup se kuch nazar bhejtaa rahegaa
 The king used to give land to the officers for cash
 jameen un anya logon ko bhi di jaati thi jinako raja puraskrit karnaa chahta tha
 Hence, in European feudalism, peasants had to work for landlords or individuals who were given land and who were called feudal lords
 saamanton kaa kartavya raja ke liye sainik ekatra karnaa tha
 Prof
 Sijvik has considered feudalism to be the result of four different tendencies
 pehali pravriti ek manushya kii duusare manushya ke saath, jo usase ucchtar str kaa tha, vaiyaktik sambandhon kii thi
 From the point of view of their security, they established a relationship with a powerful person who was personal rather than citizenship
 sarankshak or ashrith ek duusare ke saath vaiyaktik sambandhon ke judaav ke kaaran bandhe hue the
 The guardian used to protect his dependents and his strength increased due to the increasing number of dependents
 duusari pravriti manushya ke adhikaar, rajnatik sthaan tathaa uski saamaajik sthiti ke nirdhaaran karne kii pravriti thi
 In feudalism, the political relationship and social status of a person depends on how much land he owned
 teesri pravriti yah thi ki bade-bade bhupati apane pradeshon main raajnneetik satta kaa prayog karne lage
 This change happened gradually
 unhen yah adhikaar prarambh se praapt nahin tha, kendriya satta kii durbalata ke kaaran jaise-jaise unki shakti badi, unhone apane pradesh kii suvyavastha ke liye apane adhikaron ko badhaayaa or un par shashan karne lage
 The fourth trend was the tendency of segregation of social classes, there were two types of people dependent on the king or feudal
 pehle ve jo sainik sevaaon ke badale raja yaa saamanton se bandhe hue the tathaa duusare ve jo unki bhoomi par krishi yaa anya prakaar ke kaary karte the
 Mr
 H
S
 Devius, while determining the nature of communism, analyzed its fundamental tendencies, stating that "under this system, a person was contracted to his lord in terms of security
" vah apane saamanti prabhut se pruthak apni swatantra satta kii ghoshnaa nahin kar saktaa tha
 War was the main principle of the feudal system
 bhai-bhai ke viruddh or putr pita ke viruddh ladane main koi sankoch nahin karata tha
 The condition of the lower class was also very lamentable
 ’’ prastut drushtikon main vyakti kii suraksha kii bhaavana par adhik bal diya gaya he evam saamanti sambandhon tathaa anubandhon kii dridhtaa kii ore sanket kiya gaya he
 The lord from whom the person benefited, had to demonstrate his masterly devotion to him
 vyakti kii nijee swatantraaa samaapt ho jaati thi
 According to Henny S
 Lucus, "the feudal organization had an important place in the feudal organization

 The feudal provided military aid to the king, was entitled to receive the king's advice by giving critical advice to the king
 bewstor mahoday ne apane kosh main samantvaad ke swaroop main prakaash daalate hue likhaa he ki ‘‘yah ek aisi raajnneetik vyavastha thi jo raja or samant ke bhoomi se sambandhit parsparik sambandhon par adhrith thi tathaa jisamen bhoomi praptakarta dwaara seva or aadar-bhaavana swaamitv, sahaayta, vivaah aadi kii ghatnaayen pramukh thi
 '' chambers insaclopeediya main samantvaad vishyak manyataon main swami bhakthi or ajna-paalan par bal dete hue likhaa gaya he ki ‘‘samantvaad shabd yadhyapi samaaj vyavastha kaa ek prakaar he tathaa mukhya rup se un vyakti sambandhon kii vyakhya karata he jo jameen ke adhikaar or vyaktigat sampati ke aadhaar par ek vyakti kii duusare vyakti ke prati adheenta prakat karte he, tathaapi yah vyaktigat sambandhon or niyamon kii us vishisht paddati kii ore sanket karata he jisamen ek ore suraksha tathaa nirvaah he tathaa duusari ore seva tathaa ajna paalan he
 Thus, the responsibility of the security of the feudal subsistence and feudalism: social and economic development process was on the Lord

 On non-compliance, the king could only in principle remove him from the land by withdrawing it

 After the death of Samanta, his successor was made his lord, who used to visit the state court and presented his lord's devotion to the king by offering something
 ’’ Thus by the king giving land to the feudal and by the feudal lords to the chieftains below him, hereditary and a new level of feudalism ie sub-feudalism was born

 The basis of this system was a self-sufficient economy, in which the production of goods was not for sale in the market, but mainly for the use of local farmers and their owners
 ’’ There is no broadly accepted modern definition of feudalism
 shabd samantvaad yaa saamanti vyavastha purv aadhunik kaal main gadha gaya tha or aksar raajnneetik or mat prachaar sandarbh main istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 By the mid-20th century, François Louis Ganshoff's Fudilism, 3rd ed
, Became a traditional definition of feudalism
 1960 ke dashak ke baad se jab mark bloch ke fudal sosayadi iskaa samavarti hua jab ise pehali baar angreji main anuwaad kiya gaya, kai madhyakaalin itihaaskaaron ne ek vyapak saamaajik pahalu ko isamen shaamil kiya, isamen jameendaari ke band ko joda, jise kabhi-kabhi "saamanti vyavastha" ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 Since the 1970s, when Elizabeth A
R
 Brown published The Tyranny of a Construction, with many re-examining the evidence and concluding that feudalism is an incurable term and should be removed from scholarly and academic discussion altogether or at least only for serious merit and warning
 It should be used together
 europea sandarbh ke baahar, samantvaad kii avadharana kaa saamaanya taur par saadrishy ke dwaara prayog kiya jaataa he, shogun ke tahat sabase adhik baar japan main charchaa kii jaati he or kabhi-kabhi madhyayugin or gondarine ithiopia
 haalanki, kuch saadrishy samantvaad ko aage liya gaya he, pracheen misr, parthian samrajya, bhartiya upmahadweep or america ke dakshin ladaai ke pehle vividhta ke rup main dekha jaataa tha
 The term feudalism is also used — often inappropriately or even predominantly — those applied to medieval Europe — often inappropriately or blasphemously — in non-western countries where institutions and practices were considered to be the same with medieval Europe
 kuch itihaaskaaron or raajnneetik siddhanton kaa maananaa he ki kai myanon main samantvaad shabd kaa prayog iske vishisht arth ko vanchit karne ke liye kiya gaya he jiske chalate samaaj ko samajhane main is upyogi avadharana ko asweekaar kiya gaya he
 The feudalistic version of François Louis Ganshoff describes the mutual legal and military obligations between major wars and revolves around three important concepts of God, vassal, and ownership
 ek prabhu vyapak arth main ek mahaan sandarbh he jo jameen par kabja karata tha, ek jagirdaar bhagwaan ke dwaara jameen ko apanaataa tha or bhoomi ko jaagir ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 In exchange for the use of ownership and protection of the lord, the vassal will provide some form of service to the lord
 vahaan kaarykaal saamanti desh ke kai kismein the, jisamen sainya or gaiyr sainya shaamil the
 The form of feudal feudalism was based on the relationship between the lord and the jagirdar, between the obligations and its authority
 isse pehle ki prabhu kisi ko bhoomi anudaan kar sake, unhen us vyakti ko ek jagirdaar bananaa padataa tha
 It was performed in a ceremonial and symbolic ceremony called the Commendation Ceremony and this oath and tribute act was divided into two parts
 shradhanjali ke dauraan swami or maatahat ek anubandh main aate hai jo jagirdaar ko apane aadesh main prabhu ke liye ladane ke li pravesh karnaa hota tha, haalanki prabhu ko bahari takaton se jagirdaar kii raksha karne kaa vaada ke liye sahamat hona padataa tha
 The Shraddhanjali comes from the Latin word Fidelitas and the lord Earth feudal was a vindication of himself by a vassal
 "shrandhanjali" bhi shapath ke liye sanderbhit karata he or adhik spasht rup se shradhanjali ke dauraan kiye gaye jagirdaar kii patibaddhtaon ko pushti karata he
 Such an oath was followed by tribute
 ek baar prashasti samaaroh puraa kiya gaya, prabhu or jagirdaar ke saath ek saamanti sambandh aapasi dayitvon par ek duusare par sahamat the
 The principal responsibility of the lord was "aid", or vassal for military service
 jo bhi upkaran kaa upyog kar jagirdaar milkiyat se rajasav ke aadhaar par praapt kar saktaa he, maatahat ko kol karne ke liye prabhu kii ore se sainya seva karne ke liye uttar jimmedaar tha
 The primary reason for this security of military help was to enter into the feudal lord's relationship
 iske alaava, jagirdaar ko apane prabhu kii anya daayitv ho sakate hai, jaise court main pravesh, chaahe jaagirgari, saamanti yaa raja ke khud ke court main upasthiti
 yah bhi "salaah" pradaan karne ke jagirdaar shaamil saktaa he, isliye yadi prabhu ek bada faisla vah apni sari jagirdaar ko bulaane or ek concil yojit karenge saamana karnaa padaa he
 This agricultural policy at the jagir level may be a fairly mundane matter, but it also involved the handing down of punishment from criminal to criminal offenses, including capital punishment in some cases
 raja kii saamanti adaalat ke sambandh main, is tarah ke vivechna yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke sawaal shaamil ho sakate hai
 These examples are in Europe depending on location and period of time, customs and feudal practices varied, see examples of feudalism

 Feudalism has traditionally emerged as a result of decentralization of an empire

 The cavalry troops came to encompass a more secure area as well as social, political, judicial and economic areas over their allotted land and a system of hereditary rule over their power

 Only when the centralized power to maintain the existence of infrastructure with European monarchies vanished as feudalism eventually began to yield organized power and new power

 Feudalism became a popular and widely used term in 1748,) thanks to the law of Montescui de l'sprit the ruling class of the Lois power of des souls
 His definition is classic feudalism today is the most widely known and the vassal is also an easy way to understand, simply put, when a lord granted a lord, the vassal provided return service to the military

 The name Surdas is paramount among the devout poets who flow the Ajsara stream of Krishna devotion
 hindi sahitya main bhagwaan shrikrishna ke anany upaask or brajabhasha ke shreshth kavi mahatma surdaas hindi sahitya ke surya maane jate hai
 The unique poetry of Kamini in Hindi poetry has contributed to enriching the Hindi language is unique
 surdaas hindi sahitya main bhakthi kaal ke sagun bhakthi shakha ke krishna-bhakthi upashakha ke mahaan kavi hai
 Surdas was born in 1478 AD in a village called Runkata
 yah gaanv mathura-agra maarg ke kinare sthit he
 Some scholars believe that Sur was born in a poor Saraswat Brahmin family in a village called Sihi
 baad main ye agra or mathura ke bich gaughat par aakar rahane lage the
 Surdas's father, Ramdas, was a singer
 surdaas ke janmaandh hone ke vishay main matbhed he
 Initially, Surdas lived at Gaughat near Agra
 vahiin unki bhent shri vallabhacharya se hui or ve unke shishy ban gaye
 Vallabhacharya initiated him in Pushtimarga and ordered him to sing the post of Krishnalila
 surdaas kii mrityu govardhan ke nikat parsauli gram main 1580 isvi main hui
 Becoming Surdadas? madan mohan ek bahut hi sundar or tej buddhi ke navayuvak the vah har din nadi ke kinare ja kar baith jaataa or geet likhata 
 One day there was a sentence that charmed his mind
 hua ye kii ek sundar navayuvati nadi kinare kapadey dho rahi thi madan mohan kaa dhyaan uski taraf chalaa gaya 
 The girl attracted Madan Mohan so much that he stopped writing poetry
 tathaa pure dhyaan se us yuvati ko dekhne laga 
 He felt as if Radhika was sitting on the banks of the Yamuna
 us navayuvati ne bhi madan mohan kii taraf dekha or unke paas aakar boli aap madan mohan ji ho naa? to vah bole haa main madan mohan hoon
 i write poems and sing, i saw you and stopped
 navayuvati ne poocha kyon ? to vah bole aap ho hi itani sundar 
 This sequence lasted for several days
 jab yah baat madan mohan ke pita ko pataa chali to unako bahut krodh aayaa 
 Then Madan Mohan also left home
 par us sundar yuvati kaa cheharaa unke saamne se nahin ja rahaa tha ek din vah mandir me baithe the tabhi vah ek shaadishuda bahut hi sundar stri aae 
 Madan Mohan followed them
 jab vah uske ghar pahunche to uske pati ne darwaja kholaa tathaa pure aadar samaann ke saath unhen andar bithaaya 
 Then Mandan Mohan asked for two burning strings and put it in his eye
 is tarah madan mohan bane mahaan kavi surdaas 
 There is a difference of opinion among scholars regarding Surdas's date of birth and birthplace
 "sahitya lahari' sur kii likhi rachana maani jaati he
 In this, the following position is found in relation to the creation period of Sahitya Lahiri - iskaa arth sanwat 1607 isvi main mana gaya he, atev "sahitya lahari' kaa rachana kaal sanwat 1607 vi0 he
 This text also provides evidence that Guru of Sur was Sri Ballabhacharya
 surdaas kaa janm san0 1535 isvi ke lagbhag thahartaa he, kyonki ballab sampradaay main aisi manyata he ki ballabhacharya surdaas se das din bade the or ballabhacharya kaa janm ukt sanwat kii baishakh krishna ekadshi ko hua tha
 Therefore, the birth date of Surdas seems to be Vaishakh Shukla Panchami, Samvat 1535 V, expedient
 anek pramaanon ke aadhaar par unka mrityu sanwat 1620 se 1648 isvi ke madhya sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 According to the opinion of Ramchandra Shukla Ji, Surdas is believed to be born around 1540 AD and death year around 1620 AD
 surdaas kii aayu "surasaravali' ke anusaar us samay 67 varsh thi
 He was born in the field of Runukta or Renu on the basis of 'chaurasi Vaishnavan talks'
 mathura or agra ke bich gaughat par ye nivas karte the
 He met Ballabhacharya right there
 "bhavaprakash' main sur kaa janm sthaan sihi naamak gram bataaya gaya he
 He was a Saraswat Brahmin and blind of birth
 "aaine akabari' main tathaa "mutkhbut-tavaarikh' ke anusaar surdaas ko akbar ke darbari sangitagnon main mana he
 Surdas Srinath's "sanskritavarta Manipala", Shri Hariray's "bhava-prakash", Sri Gokulnath's "nijavarta" etc
 are considered blind births
 lekin radha-krishna ke rup soundarya kaa sajiv chithran, naanaa rangon kaa varnan, sookshm paryvekshanshiltaa aadi gunon ke kaaran adhiktar vartmaan vidwaan sur ko janmandh sweekaar nahin karte
 Shyamsundar Das has written in this regard - "sur was not actually born, because no one can make the same praise as that which he describes of beauty and color
 " doctor hajariprasad dvivedi ne likhaa he - "sursagar ke kuch padon se yah dhwani avashya nikalati he ki surdaas apane ko janm kaa andhaa or karm kaa abhaagaa kehete hai, par sab samay iske akshararth ko hi pradhan nahin maananaa chahie
 " surdaas ji dwaara likhit paanch granth bataae jate hai: The last two above are inaccessible
 nagari prachaarini sabha dwaara prakashit hastlikhit pustakon kii vivaran talika main surdaas ke 16 granthon kaa ullekh he
 These include Suryasagar, Sursaravali, Sahitya Lahiri, nal-damayanti, in addition to the wedding books, Dasamskandh Tika, Naglila, Bhagavat, Govardhan Leela, Surapchisi, Sursagar Saar, Pranpari, etc
 inamen prarambh ke teen granth hi mahatvapurn samajhe jate hai, sahitya lahari kii praapt prati main bahut prakshiptansh jude hue hai
 "sahitya Lahiri, Sursagar, Sur's Table
 shrikrishna ji kii bal-chhavi par lekhnee anupam chali
 
 " Sur has Krishna love and melody
 jisaki abhivyakti badi hi swaabhaavik or sajiv rup main hui he
 Thus we see that Surdas is a great poet of Hindi literature, because he not only equipped literature in terms of sentiment and language, but also gave birth to a specific tradition of Krishna-poetry
 bering jamini pul yaa beringia ek jamini pul tha jo asia ke sudur purvottar ke siberia kshetra ko uttar america ke sudur pashchimottar alaska kshetra se jodta tha
 The width of the lease of this earth was about 1,600 km from north to south, i
e
 its area was quite large
 pichley himyug ke dauraan samudron kaa bahut sa pani barf ke rup main jamaa hua hone se samudr-tal aaj se neeche tha jis vajah se beringia ek jamini kshetra tha
 At the end of the ice age, many of the ice melted, rose to sea level and Berinjia sank below the sea
 jab beringia astitv main tha to kshetreey mausam anukool hone kii vajah se yahan barfabaari kam hoti thi or vaataavaran madhya asia ke stapi maidaanon jaisaa tha
 Historians believe that at that time some human groups migrated from Asia and settled here
 vah beringia se aage uttar america main daakhil nahin ho paae kyonki aage bhimkaay himaniyaan unka rasta roke hue thim
 After this, with a snow wall between Berinjia and Asia, a few thousand humans on Berinjia survived the terrible outbreak of the Ice Age without contact with other humans for almost 5,000 years
 aaj se qareeb 16,500 varsh pehle himaniyaan pighalane lagi or ve uttar america main pravesh kar gaye
 Around the same time, Berinjia also began to drown in water, and from about 6,000 years ago, the coasts became like the ones seen in the modern era
 beringia lagbhag 4,000 kimi lambaa or 1,600 kimi chaudaa tha
 It ran from the Lena River in modern Siberia to the Mackenzie River in Canada
 iskaa kshetra itnaa bada tha ki kuch bhuvaigyanikon ke anusaar yah ek jamini pul kam or ek upmahadweep zyaada tha
 By conducting research on the collagen present in the bones of mammoth remains, scientists have argued that western Berinjia was much drier and colder than Eastern Berinjia and therefore there was greater richness and diversity of creatures and plants in eastern Berinjia
 beringia ek bada kshetra tha or iskaa adhiktar bhaag himanion se mukt tha or iske stapi jaise kshetra par bahut se jaanavar rahete the
 That's why even a few thousand humans could live here
 mana jaataa he ki yah 5-17 hazaar saal tak beringia main rahe or duusare maanav samaajon se inkaa koi sampark nahin tha
 Some historians think that the Paleolithic culture of Belgian humans at one time spanned the whole of Berinjia from the Primordia region of Siberia in the east to Alaska in the west and Hokkaido in the south
 beringiaayiyon ke koi avshesh nahin milen hai kyonki yah puraa upmahadweep ab sagar ke neeche duba hua he
 The life of these Berinjians was certainly difficult because it was a very cold terrain
 yah ek shikari-faramar jeevani vyateet karte the or ausatan 40 saal se bhi kam umr tak jite honge
 In summer a large number of mosquitoes and other pests will disturb them, as is also seen in Siberia
 jab mausam badla or unka ilaaka doobane par beringian uttar america main jane par majaboor hue, to unhen america kii alag aab-o-hawa main nae sire se jivan vyateet karnaa siikhnaa padaa hoga
 a genetic research conducted in 2005 indicates that perhaps less than 80 lineages of Berinjians have survived to modern times, that is, all others have ended up without running into further trouble
 beringia par oont, maimath, america singh, ghode, hiran, bhed, bhediya or stapi bhainse jaise jaanavar rahaa karte the
 Elephants, hairy rhinoceros and lions are now extinct in North America, but they reached there from Asia through this ground bridge
 adhyayan se yah bhi gyaat hua he ki vastav main unton kaa vansh sabase pehle uttar america main shuru hua tha or oont vahaan se beringia se guzarakar asia or vishwa ke anya bhaagon main pahunche
 Historians speculate that Berinjian humans became adept at hunting them in Berinzia amidst giant animals like mammoths
 baad main jab yah falkar alaska or uttar america ke anya bhaagon main gaye to vahaan bhi unhone apni maharath se bade paimaane par in bade jaanwaron kaa shikaar jari rakhaa
 It is believed to be a major cause of the extinction of mammoths, mastodons and hairy rhinoceros in the North American continent
