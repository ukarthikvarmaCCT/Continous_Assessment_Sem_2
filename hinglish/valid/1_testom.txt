 File transfer protocol is a network protocol through which files are exchanged over an Internet-based TCP / IP network
 ise upayokta aadhaarit kuta yaa anonimas yujar acces ke dwaara kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 Now with FTP servers in almost every institution, this system does not work
 anek haal ke web broujar or file prabandhak apatpi sarvaron se jud sakate hai
 This can do the same thing as local files on files coming from remote locations
 isamen apatpi yuarel prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 Other methods of sending files such as SFTP and SCP are not associated with FTP
 inaki puri prakriya main esaech kaa prayog hota he
 The File Transfer Protocol or FTP in its current form has arrived at various stages
 sarvapratham 16 april, 1971 main ise refsi 114 ke naam se taiyaar kiya gaya tha jise baad main june, 1980 main refsi 765 se badla gaya jise san aktubar 1985 main refsi 959 se parivartit kiya gaya
 After that, many security related changes came
 ye suraksha sambandhi badlaav isliye laae gaye the kyonki aarambh main sanchikaayen bhejne kaa yah tarika bahut asurakshit tha
 The main reason for this vulnerability was that anyone could steal or copy that file on the same network in the process of sending the file
 achtitipi, esaimatipi or tailnet se purv yah internet protocol ke kaaryakshetra main aane vaali ek aam samasya bani hui thi
 This problem was possible only through SFTP
 apatpi ko sakriy mod, niskriy mod or vistrut niskriy mod main sanchalit kiya ja saktaa he
 In September 1998 by RFC 2428, extended passive mode was added
 network par data antarit karte samay, kai data pratinidhitiv kiye ja sakate hai
 There are two most common transfer modes: FTP sarwar vaapasi code, apane bheetar ke ankon dwaara apni sthiti suchit karte hai
 The basic FTP specification is an inherently unsafe method of transferring files, as there is no specified method of transferring data in an encrypted manner
 iskaa arth yah he ki adhikansh network vinyason ke antargat, prayokta naam, password, afatipi cmand or antarit sanchikaayen, ek packet sansuchak ke upyog dwaara usee network par avasthit koi bhi antarit sanchikaon ko hathiyaa saktaa he
 This has been a common problem for many Internet protocol specifications written prior to the creation of SSL such as HTTP, SMTP, and Telnet
 is samasya ke liye aam samaadhaan he esaftipi, yaa apatpies, jo arefasi 4217 main vinirdisht tareeqe se afatipi main esasail yaa tles ancripshan jodate hai
 a host providing FTP service is additionally capable of providing anonymous FTP access
 prayokta naam ke liye puche jane par, prayokta saamaanya taur par 'anaam' khate kii seva main log-in karte hai
 Although users are generally asked to send their e-mail address in lieu of a password, little or no verification of the supplied information is done
 chunki aadhunik afatipi client aam taur par prayokta se anaam pravesh prakriya ko chhupate hai, afatipi client, password ke rup main nakli data kii aapurti kar sakate hai kyonki anuprayog ko prayokta kaa i-mail pataa gyaat nahin ho saktaa he
 The Gopher protocol, as well as the simple file transfer protocol and file service protocol, have been suggested as an alternative to anonymous FTP
 jahaan apatpi acces prayog main nahin aata, vahaan doorvarti yaa remote apatpi yaa apatpi mail prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 In this, an email is sent to another FTP server that completes the FTP command and sends back an attachment containing the download file
 yah khaskar vahaan prayog main laayaa jaataa he, jahaan FTP pahunch pratibandhit ho
 An e-mail containing the FTP command to be executed is sent to the remote FTP server
 yah ek mail sarwar hota he jo aavak i-mail ko pars karata he, afatipi commandon ko karyanvit karata he or atachament ke rup main downlod kiye gaye kisi sanchika ke saath i-mail waapas bhejtaa he
 This is obviously less flexible than an FTP client, as directories cannot be seen interacting or modifying commands, and replies may also have problems with large file attachments escaping through the mail server
 aajkal adhikansh internet prayoktaaon ke paas afatipi kaa pahunch sulabh he, atah yah prakriya dainandin upyog main prachlit nahin he
 Currently modern and recent web browsers and file managers can connect to FTP servers, although they may lack support for protocol extensions such as FTPS
 yah afatipi par doorvarti sanchikaon kii adla-badali main sthaneey sanchikaon ke liye prayukt interfes jaise madhyam ko anumat karata he
 This is done by an FTP URL
 yah is rup main hota he: Alternatively a password can be provided in the URL, eg: adhikansh web brouzaron ko niskriy mod afatipi kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jisase puraa karne hetu sabhi afatipi sarwar sakasham nahin hai
 Some browsers only allow files to be downloaded, but do not provide any means to upload files to the server
 ypi pate or port cmand par port sankhyaon kaa pratinidhitiv or pieesavi uttar, network pataa anuwaad upkarnon ke liye FTP se nipatane main ek or chunauti he
 These values have to be changed by the NAT tool, so that they include the IP address of the nat-ed client and the port selected by the NAT device for the data connection
 nayaa pataa or port sambhawatah unke dashamalav pratinidhitiv kii lambaai main apane mul pate or port se alag hon
 This means that the value on the control connection must be carefully changed, with the NAT tool changing the TCP sequence and acknowledgment fields for all subsequent packets
 adhikansh NAT upkarnon main aam taur par is tarah ke anuwaad nahin kiye jate hai, balki is uddeshy ke liye vishesh anuprayog stareey get-ve uplabdh rahete hai
 FTP over SSH refers to the use of creating a normal FTP session container over an SSH connection
 afatipi ek se adhik tisipi conekshnon kaa upyog karata he, atev esaech par tunnel bananaa vishesh rup se kathin hota he
 As with many SSH clients, attempting to prepare the tunnel for the control channel would only protect the channel; When data is transferred, FTP software on both ends will establish TCP connections, which will pass over the SSH connection to the bypass, thus securing privacy, integrity protection, etc
 anyathaa, esaech client software ke liye afatipi protocol kaa vishisht gyaan or afatipi niyantran sandeshon kii nigaraanee or punarlekhan tathaa swytt rup se afatipi data channelon ke liye nae agreshan kholana aavashyak hota zaruri he
 Version 3 of SSH Communications Security's software parikar and FONC licensed by GPL are two software packages that support this mode
 SSH kii apeksha FTP ko kabhi-kabhi surakshit FTP ke rup main bhi sanderbhit kiya jaataa he; ise FTP surakshit karne kii SSL / TLS jaisi anya paddati nahin samajhnaa chahie
 Other methods of transferring files using SSH include SFTP and SCP, which are not related to FTP; In each of these, the entire conversation is always protected by the SSH protocol

 fal golai liye lattu ke aakaar kaa or beej jaisaa hota he
 Plants are odorous, covered with soil moisture and are slightly sticky due to resin secretion
 kaenabis ke paudhon se ganja, charas or bhang, ye maadak or chikitsopayogi dravya tathaa fal, bijtel or hemp, ye udyogopayogi dravya, praapt kiye jate hai
 Flowering and fruitful branches of female plants are dried and pressed, respectively, in the form of sandals
 keval krishijaat paudhon se, jinka rezin pruthak na kiya gaya ho, ganja taiyaar hota he
 It is cultivated in wet and hot areas in rainy, rough, loam or sandy soil
 june july main boai or disambar janvari main, jab neeche kii pattiyaan gir jaati hai or pushpit shakhagra pile padane lagate hai, kataai hoti he
 In the factories, their flowered branches are repeatedly reversed, dried and pressed
 phir ganje ko golakaar banaakar dabaav ke andar kuch samay tak rakhane par isamen kuch rasinic parivartan hote hai, jo ise utkrisht bana dete hai
 Out of the good quality hemp, 15 to 25 percent of resin and maximum 15 percent ash is produced
 nari paudhon se jo raldaar srav nikalataa he usee ko haath se kachakar athwa anya vidhiyon se sangruhit kiya jaataa he

 Resin secretion begins in the flowering stage sometime first and stops after conception
 isaliye ganja yaa charas ke kheton se nar paudhon ko chhant chhantakar nikaal diya jaataa he
 Often, in the cold regions, this secretion is released
 isaliye charas kaa aayaat bharat main baahar se praaia: yaarakanda se tibet maarg dwaara, hota rahaa he
 In fact, charas is a type of gum or shape emanating from the Ganja tree, which is often wax-like and green or somewhat yellow in color, and which people drink like ganja or tobacco
 nashe main yah praayah ganje ke samaan hi hota he
 It originates in abundance in the northwest Himalayas from Nepal, Kumaon, Kashmir to Afghanistan and Turkistan, and is considered to be the best of these regions
 bengal, madhyapradesh aadi deshon main or europe main bhi yah bahut hi thodi maatra main nikalataa he
 If hemp trees are very close, then weed also comes very rarely
 kuch logon kaa mat he ki charas kaa chep keval nar paudhon se nikalataa he
 During the summer days, before the flowering of the cannabis, it is collected
 yah ganje ke danthlon ko haavan daste main kootakar yaa adhik maatra main nikalne ke samay us par se kharonchkar ikattha kiya jaataa he
 Sometimes, even wearing leather pajamas, he makes a lot of trips in the fields of the hemp, so that this shape is fitted in the same leather, scratching it back and bringing it in the form in which it is sold in the markets
 taaja charas mom kii tarah mulaayam or chamkile hare rang kaa hota he par kuch dinon baad vah bahut kadaa or matamaile rang kaa ho jaataa he

 Gregorio Robles suggests that software developed using market models should exhibit the following patterns: upyogkartaaon ko sah-developers ke rup main mana janaa chahie Users are treated like co-developers and should therefore have access to the source code of the software
 iske alaava, upyogkartaaon ko software, code ke liye code fiks, bag report, pralekhan ityadi main atirikt jamaa karne ke liye protsaahit kiya jaataa he
 More co-developers increase the rate at which software is developed
 linas ke kanoon bataate hai, "paryaapt ankhon ko dekhte hue sabhi bag uthle hote hai
 "this means that if many users see the source code, eventually they will find all the bugs and suggest how to fix them

 is prakaar, open sorce content management system jaisi chijen yaa siemes-tainaati adhik aam ho rahi hai
 In 2009, the US White House changed its CMS system from a proprietary system to a Drupal open source CMS

 muft software According to Richard Stolman, leader of the free software movement, the main difference is that by choosing one word over another, one lets others know what one's goals are: "open source is a development method; free software is a social movement
 " phir bhi, open sorce software or muft software ke bich mahatvapurn overlap he
 The FSF stated that the term "open source" promotes a different kind of ambiguity such that it confuses the availability of the source only with the freedom to use, modify, and redistribute
 duusari taraf, "muft software" shabd kii aalochana "mukt" shabd kii aspashtataa ke liye "bina kisi keemat par" kii gai thi, jise vyavsaayik god lene ke liye niraashajanak mana gaya tha, or aitihaasik aspasht upyog ke liye avadhi
 Developers have used alternative software Free and Open Source Software, or Free / Libre & Open Source Software, which is also free software to describe open source software

 Software testing is an empirical search, whereby stakeholders are made aware of the quality of the product or service under test, in the context where it is intended to be used
 software pareekshan, udyog ko software ke karyanvayan main jokhim ko samajhane or saraahna karne kii anumati dene ke liye, software kaa uddeshy or swatantra avlokan bhi pradaan karata he
 Test techniques include, but are not limited to, the process of execution of a program or application with the intention of finding software bugs
 yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki software pareekshan vah prakriya he, jo yah vidhimaanya or satyapit karti he ki ek software program / anuprayog / utpaada: Depending on the test method employed, software testing can be implemented at any time in the development process
 baharhaal, test ke adhikansh prayaas tab shuru hote hai, jab aavashyaktaaon ko paribhaashit kar diya gaya ho or koding prakriya purna ho gai ho
 Different software development models focus the test effort at different stages in the development process
 ek adhik paaramparik model main, pareekshan ke adhikansh prayaas tab shuru hote hai, jab aavashyaktaaon ko paribhaashit kar diya gaya ho or koding prakriya purna ho gai ho
 Relatively new development models, such as Agile or XP, often use development-driven testing and assign a greater share of testing to the developer in the development process
 pareekshan, puri tarah se software ke bheetar sabhi dosha kii pahchaan nahin kar saktaa he
 Instead, it presents a critique or comparison that compares the status and behavior of the product to the norm — the principle or system by which a person can identify a problem
 in pramaniktaaon main shaamil ho sakate hai vinirdesan, anubandh, tulaneey utpaada, usee utpaada kaa pichhlaa sanskaran, niyat yaa apekshit uddeshyon kaa anumaan, upyogkarta yaa graahak kii apekshaayen, upyukt maanak, prayojya niyam, yaa anya maandand
 Every software product has a target audience
 udhaaharan ke liye, video game software ke darshak, banking software se puri tarah se alag he
 Therefore, when an organization develops or invests in a software product, it can assess whether the software product will be acceptable to its end users, its target audience, its buyers and other stakeholders
 software pareekshan is moolyankan ke prayaas kii prakriya he

5 billion annually
 yadi behatar software pareekshan kii jaae, to is laagat kaa ek tihaai hissaa bachaaya ja saktaa he
 Initially, the separation of debugging from testing was attributed to Glenford J
 Promoted by Myers in 1979
 haalanki unka dhyaan bracoge pareekshan par tha isane software ejineering samudaay kii buniyadi vikaas gatividhiyon, jaise dibging ko satyaapan se alag karne kii ichha kii pushti kii
 Dave Gelperin and William C
 Hetzel classified the phases and goals in software testing in 1988 into the following stages: pareekshan kaa ek praathmik uddeshy, software vifaltaaon kaa pataa lagaana he, taaki dosha ko khoja or sudhara ja sake
 This is a non-negligible finding
 pareekshan yah sthapit nahin kar saktaa ki ek utpaada sabhi paristhitiyon main thik-thik kaary kar rahaa he, par sirf itnaa sthapit kar saktaa he ki yah kin vishisht paristhitiyon main thik-thik kaam nahin karata he
 The scope of software testing often includes the execution of that code in various environments and situations, as well as the investigation of aspects of that code, in addition to the examination of the code: whether it does what it should and what it does, what it does This needs to be done
 software vikaas kii vartmaan samskruti main ek pareekshan sanghathan, vikaas dal se alag ho saktaa he
 There are different roles for members of the test team
 software pareekshan se praapt jaankaree kaa prayog, us prakriya ko sahi karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, jiske dwaara software kaa vikaas kiya gaya he
 Functional testing refers to a test that verifies a specific action or function of the code
 ye aam taur par code kii aavashyaktaaon ke pralekhan main paaya jaataa he, haalanki kuch vikaas prakriya, prayukt maamle yaa upyogkarta khabaron se kaam karte hai
 Functional tests answer the question "can the user do it" or "does this particular feature work"
 non-functional pareekshan, software ke un pahaluon ko darshata he, jo sambhav he ki kisi vishesh prakaarya yaa upyogkarta kii kriya, jaise arohan yaa suraksha se sambandhit naa hon
 non-functional pareekshan is tarah ke sawaalon kaa jawaab detaa he ki "ek baar main kitne log log in kar sakate hai", yaa "is software ko hack karnaa kitna aasaan he"
 Not all software flaws are caused by code errors
 mahange dosha kaa ek aam strot, apekshaaon ke interval ke kaaran panapata he, udhaaharan he, aparichit apekshaayen, jo program diziner dwaara vilopan kii trutiyon main falit hote hai
 a common source of expectation interval is non-functional expectation, such as testability, mountability, maintenance capacity, usability, performance, and security
 software dosha nimnlikhit prakriyaaon ke madhyam se hote hai
 The programmer makes an error, which results in a malfunction in the source code of the software
 yadi is karaabi ko nishpadit kiya jaataa he, to kuch khaas sthitiyon main system trutipurn parinaam degaa, jo ek vifaltaa kaa kaaran banegaa
 Not all faults will necessarily result in failure
 udhaaharan ke liye, ded code main dosha, kabhi vifaltaa main parinat nahin honge
 When the environment is changed, a breakdown can turn into a failure
 pariveshgat in parivartanon ke udaahranon main shaamil hai, software kaa ek nae hardware platform par chalaaya janaa, sorce data main parivartan yaa bhinn software ke saath parsparik kriya
 ek ekal truti, vifaltaa ke vistrut lakshan main parinat ho sakati he
 It is generally believed that the earlier a malfunction is discovered, the cheaper it is to fix
 nimnlikhit talika, karaabi ke pataa lagaae jane vaale charan ke aadhaar par, use thik karne kii laagat ko darshaati he
 For example, if a problem with expectations is revealed only after release, then the cost will be 10–100 times more than the cost of detection by reviewing the expectations
 software vifaltaa kaa ek aam kaaran, anya anuprayog, ek nae oparating system, yaa, badhate hue web brouzar sanskaran ke saath sangatta he
 In the case of a lack of backwards compatibility, this may be because the programmer considered testing their program's coding or software only on the "latest version" of this-and-that operating system
 is tathy kaa anayas nateeja yah he ki: unka naveenatam kaary, software / hardware ke purv mishran ke saath puri tarah se sangat nahin bhi ho saktaa he, yaa yah ek anya mahatvapurn oparating system ke saath puri tarah se sangat nahin ho saktaa he
 In any case, these differences, whatever they may be, would have resulted in software failure, as realized by some significant sections of computer users
 ise ek "suraksha unmukh ranneeti" maan sakate hai, jo ki dev gelprin or wiliam si
 hetzel dwaara sujhaaye naveenatam parikshan charan ke saath sateek baithta he, jaisaa ki neeche uddhrut he
 
 software pareekshan ke saath ek mukhya samasya he ki input or pre-condishan ke saare combination ke antargat pareekshan sambhav nahin he, yahan tak ki ek saamaanya utpaada ke saath bhi nahin
 This means that the number of defects in a software product can be quite high and the defects that occur occasionally are difficult to find in testing
 adhik mahatvapurn rup se, gunvattta ke gair-kaaryaatmak aayam - upyog-kshamta, arohan-kshamta, nishpaadan, sangatta, vishwasaneeyata-atyant vyaktiparak ho sakate hai; kuch aisa, jo ek vyakti ke liye paryaapt mulya kaa gathan karata he, jo duusare ke liye asahneeya he
 There are several approaches to software testing
 samiksha, aar-paar guzaarana, yaa nirikshan ko static pareekshan mana jaataa he, jabaki die gaye ek pareekshan maamle ke set ke saath vaastavik nishpadit program code dinemic pareekshan mana jaataa he
 Static testing can be omitted
 dinemic pareekshan tab prayukt hota he, jab khud program ko hi pehali baar prayog kiya ja rahaa ho 
 Dynamic testing can begin to test specific parts of the code before 100% completion of the program
 iske liye vishisht takanic hai stabs / drivers kaa prayog karnaa yaa phir ek dibgar parivesh se nishpaadan
 udhaaharan ke liye, spredshit program, khud apni prakruti dwaara, kaaphi had tak paraspar rup se jaanche jate hai, jiske tahat parinaam, prayek gananaa yaa text parichaalan ke turant baad pradarshit hote hai
 Software testing is used in association with verification and authentication: satyaapan or pramanikaran shabd kaa aam taur par prayog, udyog main antar-parivartanshiltaa se kiya jaataa he; in donon shabdon ko galat tareeke se paribhaashit karnaa bhi aam he
 According to the standard terminology of IEEE Software Engineering: software pareekshan software tester dwaara kii ja sakati he
 The term "software tester" was commonly used until the 1980s, but was later seen as a separate business
 software pareekshan main avadhiyon or vibhinn lakshyon se sambandhit vibhinn bhoomikaaon ko sthapit kiya gaya he: manager, test lead, test diziner, tester, automation develper or test administrator Although controversial, software testing can be seen as an important part of the software quality assurance process
 SQA main, software prakriya visheshgy or lekha pareekshak, software or uske vikaas par ek vyapak drushtikon rakhte hai
 They investigate the software engineering process and replace it to reduce the amount of defects in the software provided: the so-called defect rate
 ek "sweekaarya dosha dar" kaa gathan karne vaali chizein software kii prakruti par nirbhar karti hai
 For example, in an arcade video game designed to give the impression of flying an airplane, it would likely have a relatively greater tolerance for faults, compared to mission critical software used to control an airliner
 Happens, which is actually flying
 yadhyapi SQA ke saath ghanishtha sambandh hai, pareekshan vibhaag aksar swatantra rup se kaary karte hai or ho saktaa he ki kisi company main SQA kaa koi kaary naa ho
 Software testing is the task of detecting defects in software by comparing the expected results of a computer program to a given input set, compared to its actual results
 virodhabhas swaroop, QA, darasal hone vaali trutiyon ko rokane ke uddeshy se nitiyon or prakriyaaon kaa karyanvayan he
 Software testing methods have traditionally been divided into black box testing and white box testing
 in donon abhigmon kaa prayog us drushtikon ke varnan ke liye kiya jaataa he, jo ek test ejeeniyar test maamalon kii digining ke liye apanaataa he
 Black box testing treats the software as a "black box" - black box testing methods without any internal implementation information include: equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, all pairs testing, fudge testing, model-based Testing, traceability metrics, exploratory testing and specification-based testing
 isliye, blike box pareekshan main ek ore "ek asambaddh raay" kaa phayda he or duusari ore "andhi talash" kaa nuksaan
 White box testing occurs when the tester has access to algorithms, including internal data structures and the code that implements it
 ve donon ek code kawarej metric ko lautaate hai, jise pratishat ke rup main mapa jaataa he
 Gray box testing involves access to internal data structures and algorithms to design test cases, but at the user, or black box level
 Changing input data and formatting output do not fall under the gray box, since input and output are clearly out of the "black-box" that we are calling the system under test
 yah antar vishesh rup se tab mahatvapurn he, jab do alag developers dwaara likhe code ke do modulon ke bich integration pareekshan sampadit kii jaati he, jahaan pareekshan ke liye sirf interphes ko prastut kiya jaataa he
 However, modifying a data repository must fall under the gray box, since typically the user will not be able to change data outside the system under test
 grey box pareekshan main reverse ejineering bhi shaamil ho sakati he, udhaaharan ke liye, boundari vailu yaa truti sandesh nirdhaarit karne ke liye
 Tests are often classified based on their place of involvement in the software development process, or by the level of specificity of the test
 unit pareekshan un pareekshanon ko sanderbhit karata he, jo code ke ek vishesh khand kii kaaryashiltaa, aam taur par prakriya str par, satyapit karte hai
 In an object-oriented environment, this often occurs at the category level and involves minimal unit testing of constructors and destructors
 is prakaar ke pareekshan aam taur par developers dwaara likhe jate hai, jab ve code par kaam kar rahe hote hai, yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki ek vishesh prakriya apekshanuroop thik dhang se kaam kar rahi he
 To catch corner cases or other branches in the code, a process may have multiple tests
 unit pareekshan akele, software ke ek ansh kii kaaryakshmata ko satyapit nahin kar sakati, balki iskaa prayog yah sunishchit karne ke liye hota he ki software dwaara prayukt building block, ek duusare se swatantra rup se kaary karte hai
 Integration testing is any type of software test that attempts to verify interfaces between components against a software design
 software ghatak ko, punraritiya tareeqe se yaa ek saath ekikrut kiya ja saktaa he
 The earlier approach is generally considered a better practice, as it allows interface issues to be quickly localized and fixed
 integration pareekshan, interphes main trutiyaan ujagar karne or ekikrut ghatak ke bich parsparik kriya ko darshane ke liye kaam karata he
 Progressively, large clusters of tested software components are integrated and tested to fit the elements of architectural design until the software begins to function as a system
 system pareekshan yah satyapit karne ke liye ek puri tarah se ekikrut system kaa pareekshan karata he ki vah apni aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karata he
 System Integration Testing confirms that a system is integrated with any external or other party systems defined in the system requirements
 regration pareekshan ek pramukh code parivartan ke baad dosha ko khojane par dhyaan kendrit karata he
 In particular, it attempts to uncover software regression or older bugs that have returned
 jab bhi software prakriya, jo pehle sahi dhang se kaam kar rahi thi or ab apekshanusaar kaary karnaa band kar de, tab aise pratigaman ghatit hote hai
 Typically, regressions occur as an unintended consequence of program change when the newly developed part of the software collides with already existing code
 regration pareekshan ke aam tareekon main shaamil he, pehle chalaae gaye pareekshan ko phir se chalaanaa or jaanch karnaa ki pehle thik kii gai kharabiyaan kahin phir se ubhar to nahin ai hai
 The depth of the test depends on the stage in the release process and the risk of additional features
 They can be either complete, for changes added too late in the release or risky, too shallow, made up of positive testing at each feature if the changes are happening early in release or are considered low risk Let's go
 exeptence pareekshan kaa taatpary do main se ek se ho saktaa he: Alpha testing is mock or real operational testing by potential users / customers or an independent test team on the developer's site
 software ke beta pareekshan main jane se pehle, alpha pareekshan ko aksar of-da-shelf software ke liye aantarik sweekruti pareekshan ke ek rup main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Beta testing comes after alpha testing
 beta sanskaran ke naam se vikhyath software kaa sanskaran, programing team se baahar ek simit graahakon ke liye jari kiya gaya
 The software is released to groups of people, so that further testing can be done to ensure that the product has minimal faults or bugs
 kabhi-kabhi, beta sanskaran ko bhavi upyogkartaaon kii adhiktam sankhya ko pratikriya ke kshetra ko badhaane ke liye, khuli janata ke liye uplabdh karaayaa jaataa he
 Special methods exist for testing non-functional aspects of software
 kaaryaatmak pareekshan ke vipareet, jo software ke sahi sanchaalan ko sthapit karata he, gair-kaaryaatmak pareekshan is baat kii pushti karata he ki software tab bhi thik dhang se kaary karata he, jab ise avaidh yaa apratyaashit input praapt hoti he
 Software fault injection, in the form of fuzzing, is an example of a non-functional test
 gair-kaaryaatmak pareekshan, vishesh rup se software kii khatir, yah sthapit karne ke liye dizine kiya gaya he ki pareekshan ke antargat rachana, avaidh yaa anpekshit input ko sahan kar sakati he yaa nahin or is prakaar ve input vailidation routine or saath hi saath erar-handlling routine kii majbootee ko sthapit kar sakenge
 Various commercial non-functional testing tools are linked to the software fault injection page; Many open source and free software tools are available, which perform non-functional testing
 parformens pareekshan, yaa lod pareekshan yah dekhne ke liye jaanch karata he ki software, badi maatra main data yaa upyogkartaaon ko sambhaal saktaa he yaa nahin
 This is generally known as software scalability
 gair-kaaryaatmak software pareekshan kii yah gatividhi aksar kshamta pariksha ke rup main jaani jaati he
 Stability testing checks to see if the software can function consistently well over or above an acceptable period
 gair-kaaryaatmak software pareekshan kii yah gatividhi aksar lod pareekshan ke rup main nirdisht hoti he
 Usability testing is needed to test whether the user interface is easy to use and understand
 suraksha pareekshan us software ke liye jaruri he jo havers dwaara system ghuspaith ko rokane ke liye gopneey data ko parishkrut karata he
 Internationalization and localization are needed to examine these aspects of software, for which a pseudostabilization method can be used
 yah is baat kii pushti karegaa ki anuprayog, ek nai bhashaa main anuwaad kiye jane yaa ek nai samskruti ke liye anukulit kiye jane ke baad bhi kaam karata he
 Destructive testing attempts to thwart software or subsystems to test its robustness
 software pareekshan ke ek aam tareeke ko, ise graahak ko bheje jane se pehle or isaki kaaryakshmata viksit kiye jane ke baad, pareekshakon ke ek swatantra samooh dwaara sampadit kiya jaataa he
 This practice often results in the testing phase being used as a project buffer to compensate for project delays and thus compromise the time devoted to testing
 ek or paripati he pariyojna ke shuru hone ke kshan hi software pareekshan ko shuru kar dena or pariyojna ke samaapan tak yah ek satat prakriya he
 In response, some emerging software disciplines such as Extreme Programming and Agile Software Development Movement follow a "test drive software development" model
 is prakriya main, software ejeeniyar dwaara unit test pehle likhe jate hai, 
 beshak ye pareekshan shuru main vifal ho jate hai; jaise ki unase ummid rahati he
 And then as the code is written it passes incrementally to a larger fraction of the test suite
 test sweet ko, vifaltaa kii nai paristhitiyon or corner cese ke milte rahane ke kaaran, lagaataar navinikrut kiya jaataa he or unhen kisi bhi viksit regration test ke saath ekikrut kiya jaataa he
 Unit tests along with the rest of the software source code are maintained and typically integrated into the build process
 haalanki sanghathanon ke bich bhinnata maujuud he, pareekshan ke liye ek vishisht chakra hota he
 The following sample is common among organizations adopting the water fall development model
 kai programing samooh, swachaalit pareekshan par adhikadhik nirbhar kar rahe hai, vishesh rup se aise samooh jotest chaalit vikaas kaa upyog karte hai
 There are several frameworks for writing tests, and continuous integration software will run the test automatically each time the code is tested in a version control system
 jabaki swachaalan vah sab kuch nirmit nahin kar saktaa, jo ki ek maanav kar saktaa he, yah regration pareekshan ke liye bahut upyogi ho sakate hai
 However, to be really useful, it requires a fully developed test suite of script tests
 program pareekshan or gadabadi kaa pataa lagane main pareekshan upkaran or dibgar dwaara kaaphi sahaayta praapt ho sakati he
 Characteristics of test / debug devices include: in gunon main se kuch ko ek ekikrut vikaas parivesh main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Generally, topics to which quality is limited are precision, completeness, safety, but may also include more technical requirements as described under ISO standard ISO 9126, such as capacity, reliability, efficiency, portability, maintenance, Compatibility and 0} usability
 kai aam software upaay maujuud hai, jinhen aksar 'matrix' kaha jaataa he, jinka prayog software kii haalat yaa pareekshan kii paryaaptta ke maapan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The software testing process can generate many artifacts
 software pareekshakon or gunvattta aashwaasan visheshgyon kii peshewar aakankshaon ko bal dene ke liye kai pramann kaarykram maujuud hai
 There is currently none of the certification provided, which actually requires the applicant to demonstrate software testing capability
 koi bhi pramanikaran, vyapak rup se sweekrut gyaan ke dhaanche par aadhaarit nahin he
 This fact has led some to say that the testing area is not yet ready for certification
 akele pramann ek vyakti kii utpaadakta, unke kaushal, yaa vyaavhaarik gyaan ko maap nahin saktaa or ek pareekshak ke rup main unki kshamta, yaa peshevraana style kii guarantee nahin de saktaa

 In the Puranas of Gujarat, it is mentioned that the land of Vadnagar was presented to the Nagro as a mark of gratitude by the king
 raja ko ek hiran ko markar swayam v apane putro ko khilne karn galtv muni dwaara ek abhishaap ke kaaran jo shwet kusht ho gaya raja ne nagar sabha se karuna kii yachana kii, krinavrt dhari nagar ne rajake kashton kaa jadi bootiyon or prakritik dawaaon

 The king would like to donate the country to the wonders, but did not accept the reward of Karna king for not valuing his mercy! 72 families of Nagar Brahmanas were of high principles, who did not accept the donation Six families accepted the gift after persuasion from the queen of King Miracle, but 66 families who did not accept the gift of Raza left their country and their descendants sixty They used to take their clans in trains, hence they are called Sathotra gotra Even today, he is revered for his sacrifice and ideals

 Roman script asal main roman lipi latini bhashaa ke liye hi bani thi, yani ki latini kii apni lipi he
 That is why each of its letters almost always gives the same pronunciation

 a hedgehog eulipotyphlan is one of the smaller mammals of the subfamily Erinaceinae in the family Erinaceidae
 paanch prajatiyon main hezhog kii sattar prajatiyaan hai, jo europe, asia or africa ke hisson or newjiland main parichay ke madhyam se pai jaati hai
 Are not native to Australia, and are not living species native to the Americas
 hezhog shorts ke saath duurastha purvajon ko saajha karte hai, jiminar sambhawatah madhyavarti link hone ke saath, or pichley 15 million varshon main thodaa badal gaya he
 Like many of the first mammals, they have adapted to a nocturnal way of life
 hejahogs kii spini suraksha asambaddha porcupin kii tarah dikhti he, jo krintak hai, or ichidon, ek prakaar kaa monotream
 The name Hedgehog came into use around the year 1450, derived from the Middle English Hedge, Hague, Hedge, as it frequents Hagergöz, and Höge, Hög, from its piglike snout
 anya naamon main urchin, hedgepig or furze-pig shaamil hai
 The collective noun for a group of hedgehogs is the array
 hezhog aasaani se unki katai se pahachaane jate hai, jo khokhale bal hote hai jo keratin ke saath kathor banaate hai
 Their spines are not poisonous or obstructed and, unlike the quills of a porcupine, do not easily detach from their bodies
 haalanki, aparipakv jaanwaron kii katai aam taur par vayask katai ke saath badal di jaati he
 This is called "quilling"
 jab pashu rogagrast ho yaa atyadhik tanaav main hota he to spin bhi shed kar sakate hai
 One defense is that all species of hedgehogs have the ability to roll in a tight ball, with all spines pointing outward
 hezhog kii peeth main do badi mansapeshiyaan hoti hai jo kwills kii sthiti ko niyantrit karti hai
 When the creature is rolled into a ball, the tucked back protects the tucked face, legs and abdomen, which are not cooled
 chunki is ranneeti kii prabhaavashiltaa katai kii sankhya par nirbhar karti he, isliye kuch registan hezhog jo kam vajan le jane ke liye viksit hote hai, ve bhaagane yaa yahaan tak ki hamalaa karne kii adhik sambhaavna rakhte hai, katai ke saath ghuspaith karne vaale ko; un prajatiyon ke liye ek chamakdaar gend main ghumaav ek antim upaay he
 Different species are prey to different predators: While forest hedgehogs are primarily prey to birds and ferrets, short species like tall species fall prey to foxes, wolves and mongooses
 hezhog mukhya rup se ratribhoj hote hai, haalanki kuch prajatiyaan din ke dauraan sakriy bhi ho sakati hai
 Hedgehogs sleep in dense stains in bushes, grass, rocks, or generally digging into the ground for a large part of the day, with varying habits between species
 taapmaana, prajatiyon or bhojan kii prachurtaa ke aadhaar par sabhi junglee hezhog hibernet kar sakate hai, haalanki sabhi nahin karte hai
 Hedgehogs are quite vocal and communicate through a combination of grunts, snuffles and / or squeals depending on the species
 hezhog kabhi-kabhi abhishek naamak ek anushthan karte hai
 When the animal encounters a new scent, it will lick and bite the source, then make a fragrant froth in its mouth and paste it with its tongue on its spines
 is aadat kaa uddeshy agyaat he, lekin kuch visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki kshetra kii nai gandh ke saath hezhog ko chhedchhad karnaa or unki katai se peedit shikariyon ko sambhavit jehar yaa sankraman kaa strot pradaan karata he
 Abhishek is sometimes called anting because of similar behavior in birds
 opossom, chuhon or mal kii tarah, hejahogon main jaanwaron kii mansapeshi pranali main protein arinasin ke madhyam se kuch saanp jehar ke khilaaf kuch prakritik pratiraksha hoti he, haalanki yah keval choti maatra main uplabdh he or ek viper kaatane abhi bhi ghaatak ho saktaa he
 In addition, hedgehogs are one of four known mammalian groups with mutations that protect against another snake venom, α-neurotoxin
 boar, shahad baijar, mongos, or hejahogon main sabhi nicotinic acetaloclin receptor main utparivartan hote hai jo saanp jehar α-neurotoxin ko badhyakaari se rokte hai, haalanki un utparivartan alag-alag or swatantra rup se viksit hote hai
 Soluble areas have not been fully studied in hedgehogs
 stanadhariyon main, mastishk kaa gharshan bhaag neopallium dwaara cover kiya jaataa he, jisase ise benakaab karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 This difficulty is not impossible, as it varies from one species to another
 test ne suzav diya he ki hezhog billiyon ke samaan vidyut gatividhi saajha karte hai
 Although traditionally classified in the now abandoned Order of Instivora, hedgehogs are ubiquitous

 In the next five centuries of his Mahaparinirvana, Buddhism spread throughout the Indian subcontinent and in the next two thousand years also spread across the central, eastern and southeastern Jambu continent

 Buddha's real name was Siddhartha
 unka janm kapilwastu ke paas lumbini main hua tha
 In this place, Emperor Ashoka built a pillar in the memory of Buddha in the third century BC
 siddharth ke pita shaakyon ke raja shuddhodan the
 According to the traditional tale, Siddhartha's mother Mahamaya died some time after his birth
 kaha jaataa he ki unka naam rakhane ke liye 8 rishiyo ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha, sabhi ne 2 sambhaavnaayen bataai thi, ve ek mahaan raja banenge ve ek sadhu yaa parivrajak banenge
 Hearing this speech, King Shuddhodana tried hard not to allow Siddhartha to become a monk to the extent of his ability
 shaakyon kaa apana ek sangh tha
 At the age of twenty, every Shakya Tarun had to be initiated into Shakya Sangha and become a member of the Sangh
 siddharth gautam jab bees varsh ke huye to unhone bhi shakyasang kii sadsyta grahan kii or shakyasang ke niyamanusaar siddharth ko shakyasang kaa sadsy bane huye aath varsh vyateet ho chuke the
 He was a very devoted and firm member of the Sangh
 sangh ke maamalon main ve bahut ruchi rakhte the
 His conduct as a member of the Sangh was an example and he made himself dear to everyone
 sangh kii sadsyta ke aathven varsh main ek aisi ghatana ghati jo shuddhodan ke parivaar ke liye dukhad ban gayi or siddharth ke jivan main sankatpurna sthiti paidaa ho gayi
 Adjacent to the kingdom of the Shakyas was the kingdom of the Kolis
 rohni nadi donon rajyon kii vibhaajak rekha thi
 Both Shakya and Koli used to irrigate their fields with the waters of the Rohini River
 har fasal par unka aapas main vivaad hota tha ki koun rohinee ke jal kaa pehle or kitna upyog karegaa
 These disputes sometimes turned into fights and battles
 jab siddharth 28 varsh ke the, rohni ke pani ko lekar shakya or coliyon ke naukaron main jhagada hua jisamen donon ore ke log ghayal huye
 On finding out the quarrel, Shakyas and Kolis thought that why should this dispute be resolved by war forever
 shaakyon ke senapati ne coliyon ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke prashn par vichaar karne ke liye shakyasang kaa ek adhiveshan bulaayaa or sangh ke samaksh yuddh kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Siddharth Gautam opposed this proposal and said that war does not solve any question, war will not serve any purpose, it will lead to the planting of another war
 siddharth ne kaha meraa prastaav he ki ham apane main se do aadmi chune or coliyon se bhi do aadmi chunane ko kahen
 Then these four together choose a fifth man
 ye paanchon aadmi milakar jhagade kaa samaadhaan karen
 Siddharth's proposal was invalidated by a majority, and Shakya Senapati's proposal for war was passed by an overwhelming majority
 shakyasang or shakya senapati se vivaad na sulajhane par antatah siddharth ke paas teen vikalp aaye
 Among the three options, he had to choose one option, joining the army, participating in war, agreeing to social boycott of his family and the confiscation of his fields, hanging or accepting expulsion
 unhone teesraa vikalp chunaa or parivrajak banakar desh chhodane ke liye raji ho gaye
 Siddhartha first started finding answers to his questions with the five Brahmins by becoming a Parivrajaka
 ve uchit dhyaan hasil kar paae, parantu unhen apane prashnon ke uttar nahin mili
 Then he tried to do penance
 ve is kaary main bhi ve apane guruon se bhi zyaada, nipun nikle, parantu unhe apane prashnon ke uttar fir bhi nahin mili
 Then he gathered some companions and went on to do more rigorous penance
 aise karte karte chah varsh baad, bina apane prashnon ke uttar paaen, bhukh ke kaaran mrityu ke kareeb se guzare, ve fir kuch or karne ke bare main sochane lage
 At this time, he remembered a moment of his childhood, when his father was starting to prepare the farm
 us samay ve ek anand bhare dhyaan main pad gayi the or unhe aisa mahasoos hua tha ki samay sthir ho gaya he
 Leaving hard austerities, he found an asexual path, which is also called the middle path, because this path is in the midst of both the austerities and the greatness of incontinence
 apane badan main kuch shakti daalane ke liye, unhone ek bakrii-vaale se kuch doodh le liya
 He sat under a peepal tree, promising that he would not rise without knowing the truth
 35 kii umr par, unhone bodhi pai or ve buddha ban gayi
 His first sermon was in Sarnath near Varanasi
 apane baaki ke 45 varsh ke liye, gautam buddha ne ganga nadi ke aas-paas apana dharmopadesh diya, dhanwaan or kangaal logon dono ko
 He also founded a union of two ascetics who continued to spread the sermon of the Buddha
 tripitak buddha dharm kaa mukhya granth he
 It is written in Palibhasha
 yah granth buddha ke parinirvana ke pashchaat buddha ke dwaara diya gaya upadeshau ko sutarabaddh karne kaa sabase vrihad prayaas he
 The sermon of Buddha is presented as a sutra in this book
 sutron ko varg main baandha gaya he
 The wag is included in the body or in the section
 nikaayon ko pitak main ekikrut kiya gaya he
 In this way three Pitakas are formed whose combination is called tri-pitaka
 palibhasha kaa tripitak theravaadi buddha parampara main srilanka, thailand, burma, laos, cambodia, bharat aadi raashtra ke buddha dharm anuyaayi paalna karte he
 Pali's Tipitaka is also translated into Sanskrit, which is called Tripitaka
 sanskrit kaa purna tripitak abhi anuplabdh he
 Presently the surviving tradition of Sanskrit Tripitaka Purpose is available only in the Newar caste of Nepal
 is ke alaava tibet, china, mongolia, japan, korea, vietnam, malaysia, rus aadi desh main sanskrit mul mantra ke saath main sthaneey bhashaa main buddha sahitya parampara paalna karte he
 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 tathagat buddha ne apane anuyaayion ko chaar aryasaty, ashtangik maarg, das parmita, panchasheel aadi shikshaaon ko pradaan kiye hai
 The first sermon of the Tathagata Buddha, which he had given to some of his sages, was about these four Aryan truths
 buddha ne chaar arya satya bataaye hai
 There is sorrow in this world
 janm main, boode hone main, beemaari main, maut main, priyatam se dur hone main, naapsand chizon ke saath main, chahat ko na paane main, sab main dukh he
 Trishna, or desire, is the cause of sorrow and continues the world with renewed vigor
 trishna se mukti pai ja sakati he
 Salvation from craving can be attained by living according to the ascendant path
 saanchaa:main:ashtangik maarg According to Buddhism, the Arya Ashtanga Path of the Fourth Arya Truth is the way to stop suffering
 gautam buddha kehete the ki chaar arya satya kii satyata kaa nishchay karne ke liye is maarg kaa anusaran karnaa chahie : 1
 Right view: Believing in the Four Noble Truths 2
 Right resolutions: Promising mental and moral development 3
 Right speech: Do not speak harmful things and lie 4
 Right actions: Do not do harmful actions 5
 Right life: Any Do not even directly or indirectly do harmful business 6
 Right efforts: Trying to improve oneself 7
 Right memory: Trying to get mental ability to see with clear knowledge 8
 Yk tombstone: Achieve Nirvana and loss of self kuch log arya ashtaang maarg ko path kii tarah samajhate he, jisamen aage badhane ke liye, pichley ke str ko paanaa aavashyak he
 And people feel that the levels of this passage are found all together
 maarg ko teen hisson main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he : pragna, sheel or samadhi
 Lord Buddha has taught his followers to follow the five Shilohs
 pali main – panatipaata vermani sikkhapadam sammaadiami ! Meaning - i take the instruction to be free from animal violence
 paali main – adinnadana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to keep away from theft
 paali main – kamesoomichhachara vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to desist from adultery
 paali nen – musavada vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to refrain from lying
 paali main – surameray majjapamadthatana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami
 Meaning - i take the education of drinking liquor, raw liquor and abstaining from intoxicants
 gautam buddha se pai gai gyaanata ko bodhi kehalaate he
 It is believed that only after getting Bodhi can be rid of the world
 sari parmitaaon kii nishpatti, chaar arya satyon kii puri samaj or karm ke nirodh se hi bodhi pai ja sakati he
 At this time, greed, guilt, fascination, avidya, craving and belief in the soul all disappear
 bodhi ke teen str hote he shravakbodhi, pratyekbodhi or samyaksambodhi
 Samyakasambodhi is considered the most advanced ideal of Buddhism
 gautam buddha ke mahaparinirvana ke baad, buddha dharm ke alag-alag sampradaay upasthit ho gayi hai, parantu in sab ke bahut se siddhant milte hai
 All Buddhist sects follow the basic principles of the Tathagata Buddha
 prathithyasamutpaada kaa siddhant kahata he ki koi bhi ghatana keval duusari ghatnaon ke kaaran hi ek jatil kaaran-parinaam ke jaal main vidyaman hoti he
 For beings, it means the cycle of infinite worlds according to karma and vipak
 kyonki sab kuch anitya or anaatman hota he, kuch bhi sach main vidyaman nahin he
 Every event is basically zero
 parantu, maanav, jinke paas gyaan kii shakti he, trishna ko, jo dukh kaa kaaran he, tyagkar, trishna main nasht kii hui shakti ko gyaan or dhyaan main badalakar, nirvana paa sakate hai
 Everything in this world is transitory and mortal
 kuch bhi sthaayee nahin
 But there is opposition from Vedic faith
 aatma kaa arth 'mai' hota he
 However, beings are made of body and mind, which do not have stability
 kshan-kshan badlaav hota he
 Therefore, there is no permanent thing called 'I' meaning soul
 jise log aatma samajhate hai, wo chetana kaa avichhinn pravaah he
 The mind has replaced the soul
 buddha ne brahm-jaal suta main sristi kaa nirmaan kaisaa hua, ye bataaya he
 The creation is created and destroyed again and again
 ishwar yaa mahabrahma sristi kaa nirmaan nahi karte kyonki duniya prathithyasamutpaada arthath kaarykaran-bhav ke niyam par chalati he
 According to Lord Buddha, karma is responsible for the grief and happiness of humans, not God or Mahabrahma
 par anya jagah buddha ne sarvocch satya ko avarnaneey kaha he
 Nothingness is the predominant philosophy of the Mahayana Buddhist sect
 vah apane hi sampradaay ke logon ko mahatv dete hai
 Buddhism does not mean pessimism
 dukh kaa matlab nirashavad nahin he, lekin saapekshavaad or yatharthwaad he
 Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are the three triratnas of Buddhism
 bhikshu, bhikshuni, upsakaa or upsika sangh ke chaar avyav hai
 The full observance of the ten parameters is called the Bodhisattva
 bodhisattva jab das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kar lete hai tab "buddha" kehalaate hai
 Becoming a Buddha is the culmination of a Bodhisattva's life
 is pahchaan ko bodhi naam diya gaya he
 Buddha Shakyamuni is said to have only one Buddha - there were many before him and there will be more in the future
 unka kahana tha ki koi bhi buddha ban saktaa he agar vah das parmitaaon kaa purna paalan karte hue bodhisattva praapt kare or bodhisattva ke baad das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kare
 The ultimate goal of Buddhism is the end of suffering from the entire human society
 "main keval ek hi padaarth sikhaata hoon - dukh he, dukh kaa kaaran he, dukh kaa nirodh he, or dukh ke nirodh kaa maarg he" 
 Followers of Buddhism walk on the asexual path and live according to it and try to get rid of ignorance and sorrow and attain nirvana
 buddha dharm main sangh kaa bada sthaan he
 In this religion Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are called 'triratna'
 sangh ke niyam ke bare main gautam buddha ne kaha tha ki chote niyam bhikshugan parivartan kar sakate he
 After their Mahaparinirvan, there was a huge increase in the size of the Sangh
 is vruddhi ke pashchaat vibhinn kshetra, samskruti, saamaajik avasthaa, diksha, aadi ke aadhaar par bhinn log buddha dharm se aabaddh hue or sangh kaa niyam dhire-dhire parivartan hone laga
 At the same time, in the Kalam Sutta of Angushava Nikaya, Buddha has given freedom to practice religion on the basis of his experience
 atah, vinay ke niyam main parimarjan / parivartan, sthaneey saanskrithik / bhashik paksh, vyaktigat dharm kaa swatantrata, dharm ke nishchit paksh main zyada vaa kam jod aadi kaaran se buddha dharm main vibhinn sampradaay vaa sangh main parimarjeet hue
 Presently, the major sect or creed in these sanghas are Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana
 bharat main buddha dharm kaa navyan sampradaay he jo purnat shuddh, maanavtaavaadi or vigyaanvaadee he
 Template: Main: Theravada saanchaa:main:mahayan Template: Main: Vajrayana saanchaa:main:navyan Five main shrines are considered to be main for followers of Lord Buddha around the world: yah sthaan nepal kii tarai main nautanwaan railway stesan se 25 kilometre or gorakhpur-gonda line ke naugarh stesan se kareeb 12 kilometre dur he
 Now a paved road has also been built from Naugarh to Lumbini
 isa purv 563 main rajkumaar siddharth gautam kaa janm yaheen hua tha
 However, most of the ancient viharas of Buddha's time here have been destroyed

 Apart from this pillar there is a statue of Buddha in a Samadhi Stupa
 nepal sarkaar ne bhi yahaan par do stupa or banawaye hai
 Even after wandering near various places and various gurus for six years, Buddha did not get the ultimate knowledge anywhere
 iske baad ve gaya pahunche
 In the end, he vowed that until real knowledge is available, he will not rise from under the Peepal tree, even if he dies
 iske baad kareeb chah din tak din raat ek pipal vriksh ke neeche bhukhe-pyaase tap kiya
 Eventually he attained supreme knowledge or wisdom
