 yahaan tak ki rajya sarkarein bhi ofshoring kaa upyog karti hai
 The term is used in many different but closely related ways
 kabhi-kabhi ise vyapak arth main kisi videshi strot se aisi seva ke vikalp ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he jo pehle form main aantarik rup se pradaan kii ja rahi thi
 In other cases, it only includes services imported from its subsidiary unit or other closely connected suppliers
 ek or uljhan he ki aanshik rup se taiyaar computer jaise madhyavarti maal, is shabd ke daayre main susangat rup se shaamil nahin kiye jate hai
 "reshoring" is the offshoring that is brought back to shore
 ofshoring ko yaa to utpaadan ofshoring yaa sevaaon ke ofshoring ke sandarbh main dekha ja saktaa he
 After its accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001, the People's Republic of China emerged as a major destination for production offshoring
 After improving the prospects of services business by technological advancements in telecommunications, India became the leading country in this field although now many countries of the world are emerging as offshoring destinations
 iskaa aarthik tark laagat ko kam karnaa he
 If some people can give their skills more cheaply than others, then those people get comparative advantage
 iske peeche vichaar yah he ki desh swatantra rup se un vastuon kaa vyapaar karen jinke utpaadan main unhen nunatam laagat aati he
 Offshoring is defined as a business process that is transferred to the same company in one country or another company in another country
 lagbhag hameshaa hi kaam ko nae sthaan main parichaalan kii kam laagat ke kaaran sthanantarit kiya jaataa he
 Offshoring is sometimes compared to outsourcing or offshore outsourcing
 outsorcing aantarik vyapaar prakriyaaon ko kisi bahya company se karaayaa janaa he
 In the same country, subcontracting companies are outsourcing, not offshoring
 company jo apane aantarik vyapaar ikai ko ek desh se duusare desh main sthanantarit kar rahi hon ve outsorcing nahin, balki ofshoring yaa bhautik punargathan kar rahi hogi
 a company that is subcontracting a business unit to a different company in another country will be doing both outsourcing and offshoring
 sambandhit shabdon main shaamil he niyarshoring, jiskaa arth he vyapaar prakriyaaon ko kam laagat vaale bhugolic rup se atyant nikat videshi sthanon main punah basaanaa ; inshoring, jiskaa arth he desh ke bheetar hi sevaayen praapt karnaa; or bestshoring, yaa rhitashoring, vibhinn mandandon par aadhaarit "uttam tat" kaa chayan
 bijness proces outsorcing aisi outsorcing vyavastha ko sanderbhit karata he jab samast vyavsaayik kaary outsource kiye jate hai
 More specific terms can be found in the field of software development - for example Global Information Systems developed as a range of systems by / for globally expanded teams
 ofshoring ke saath kabhi-kabhi judane vaala ek or shabd he bodyshopping, jo puure vyavsaayik kaary ko apatati sthaan se karaane ke vyapak iraade ke bina, kisi vyapaar parivesh main chote alag-alag kaamon ko karne ke liye apatati sansadhano or carmikon ke upyog kii paddati he
 Production offshoring, also known as physical reorganization of established products, involves the transfer of physical manufacturing processes to a low-cost destination
 utpaadan ofshoring ke udaahranon main shaamil he costa rika main electronic ghatakon kaa nirmaan, china, vietnam aadi main vastra, khilone tathaa upabhokta vastuon kaa utpaadan
 Offshoring the process of product design, research and development oriented towards new products is relatively difficult
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki utpaadon ko behatar banane or nae namoona dizine taiyaar karne ke liye apekshit anusandhan or vikaas ke liye kaushal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo saste mazaduron vaale kshetra se hasil karnaa mushkil he
 Because of this, in many cases only manufacturing offshoring is done by a company wishing to reduce costs
 tathaapi, ofshoring or patent pranali shakti ke bich ek sambandh he
 The reason for this is that under a strong patent system, companies are not afraid to work offshore as their work will remain their property
 Conversely, companies in countries with weak patent systems have a greater fear of theft of an intellectual property from foreign vendors or workers and, therefore, reduce offshoring
 bhautik punargathan ko tab baari protsaahan mila jab uttar america mukt vyapaar samjhauta ne nirmaataaon ke liye apni utpaadan suvidhaon ko america se mexico sthanantarit karnaa aasaan bana diya
 This trend later shifted to China, which provided low wages, workers' rights laws, fixed currency for US dollars, cheap loans for new companies, huge economic benefits based on land and factories, low environmental regulations and cities with millions of population, Offered where workers are engaged in making a single type of product
 tathaapi, kai companiyaan bauddhik sampatti kaanoon ke pravartan main shithilataa kii vajah se atyaadhunik utpaadon ke ucch-mulya yojit utpaadan ko china main sthanantarit karne kii icchhuk nahin he
 CAFTA has increased the pace of physical restructuring

 All this continued till the year 2000

 And in both countries, the employment opportunities increase because the workers who have lost their jobs in the country of origin can get better employment which is relatively beneficial for their country

 Experts argue that in developed countries the quality of any new employment is lower than lost jobs and lower wages are offered

 Not surprisingly, many American executives cite the current level of unemployment in the United States as positive evidence that offshoring has neither been harmful to American workers nor to the United States
 yah bahes kaa vishay ho saktaa he ki vartmaan berojgaare ke aankadon ke upyog kii samasyaon main se ek he ki isamen ghatate rojgaar ke aankadon par dhyaan nahin diya gaya he
 More importantly, this debate has neither considered nor anticipated the impact of continuous offshore outsourcing 10–20 years from today, for example the potential increase in labor costs in emerging countries and Changes in their economic location, as has been the case in Japan and South Korea in the last decades
 vinirmaan kshetra main rojgaar kii giravat ne audyogic kshetra ke kamgaaron ke bich kaafii bhay utpann kiya he, haalanki kai deshon main kul rojgaar main badhotaree ho rahi he
 Its impact has been shown more than offshoring or foreign investment, yet the benefits of unemployment are being overshadowed by them, as large offshoring projects are more visible to the people than the slow change from industrial society to post-industrialization society
 
 Nevertheless, employment generation in the US was slow and wages were low during the period 2000–2005
 Some people blame offshoring for this
 Since the 1970s, there has been a steady increase in long-term unemployment as a percentage of total employment
 2003 main dderghaavadhik berojgaare main 22%+ vruddhi rahi
 By March 2009, 45
6% of the people living on unemployment insurance had paid all the funds but could not find any jobs
 kol centre jaise anuprayogon kii ofshoring ke saath, ek yah bhi bahes chhid gai ki is prakaar kaa abhyaas graahakon ko companiyon se milane vaali graahak seva or takneekee sahaayta kii gunvattta ko gambhir nuksaan pahunchaa rahaa he
 Many companies have suffered public indignation for their decision to use foreign personnel for customer service and technical assistance, mostly due to the linguistic problem it poses
 haalanki kuch deshon main ucch stareey yuva, kushal shramik hai jo apni janmajaat bhashaa ke rup main angrezi bolne main sakasham hai, lekin unke angrezi kaushal ne uttari america main sawaal khadaa kiye hai
 Behind the criticism of outsourcing by the majority of the American public is the backlash from poor customer service and technical support that foreign workers are providing when attempting to negotiate with Americans
 kuch logon kaa daawa he ki outsorcing ke antargat companiyaan apni visteern aapurti shrinkhalaa par niyantran or drishyata kho rahi hai, jiske falswaroop jokhim bad jaataa he
 a 121 electronics industry statistics survey conducted by Industry Directions Inc
 and the Electronics Supply Chain Association in 2005 found that 69% of respondents said that since outsourcing began, their control over at least 5 supply chains has waned, While 66% of the providers felt that their total exposure to customers was high or very high
 36% pradaataaon ne jawaab diya ki unhone outsorcing se pehle kii apni anischitata kii tulana main ab anischitata ke jokhim main vruddhi mahasoos kii he
 62% of respondents described at least two major business partnership management behaviors as "problematic", including performance management and general consensus on results
 According to this research, 40% of the total respondents faced resistance to risk sharing in outsourced partnership agreements
 desh ke baahar gyaan ke antaran se mul companiyon ko swayan ke khilaaf bhi koi pratispardhi taiyaar ho saktaa he
 Chinese manufacturers have already started selling their goods directly to foreign customers without going through previous domestic intermediaries with whom they had contracted for their services
 1990 or 2000 ke dashak main, america auto nirmaataa apane vaahanon ke liye kalpurje taiyaar karne ke liye teji se china kii ore rukh karne lage
 By 2006, China had acquired the technology well and announced that they would now compete with American auto manufacturers in their home markets selling Chinese automobiles to the American people
 jab koi company kisi duusare desh main maal or sevaaon kaa utpaadan karti he, to jo nivesh vah gharelu bazaar main karti, vah videshi bazaar main sthanantarit ho jaataa he
 Corporate money, which is spent in factories, training and taxes, is spent in the foreign market rather than spent in the company's market
 videshi bazaar main jaise-jaise utpaadan badhata he, yogya or anbhavi gharelu kaamgaar chhod kar chale jate hai yaa unhen majabuuran apni naukari se haath dhonaa padataa he, jab ki kai baar unhen sthai rup se udyog chhodana padataa he
 At some stage, very few domestic workers are left to perform dramatically
 isse gharelu bazaar ko un vastuon or sevaaon ke liye videshi bazaar par nirbhar hona padataa he, jo ranneetik taur par "khokhale" swadesh ko or kamazor bana detii he
 In fact, offshoring prepares and strengthens competitive industries abroad, while strategically weakening the home country
 tathaapi, rojgaar ke aankade is daawey par andeh jataate hai
 For example, IT employment in the US has recently reached a pre-2001 level and has been increasing since then
 ofshoring ke kaaran chhootane vaali naukariyon kii sankhya puure america shram bazaar ke 1 pratishat se bhi kam rah gaya he
 According to a study by the Heritage Foundation, outsourcing represents a very small proportion of the jobs left in the US
 ofshoring kii badaulat chhootane vaali naukariyon kii kul sankhya, donon nirmaan or takneekee, america main chhuti naukariyon ke keval 4 pratishat kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 The main reasons for job cuts are contract termination and reduction in workforce
 kuch arthshaastriyon or tikaakaron kaa daawa he ki ofshoring ke maamle ko kuch zyaada hi badha-chadha kar kaha ja rahaa he
 One solution often offered for domestic employees losing jobs due to offshoring is re-training for new jobs
 Some displaced employees are higher education and graduate qualified
 kisi anya kshetra main unke vartmaan str tak punah prashikshan, shiksha main lage varshon or aaveshtit shaikshanik laagat kii drushti se shaayad hi sahi vikalp ho saktaa he
 According to classical economists, the components of production are three, land, labor and capital
 Offshore depends heavily on the dynamics of any two of these factors
 arthath, ofshoring kaise arth-vyavasthaaon ko prabhavit karata he is baat par nirbhar karata he ki kitni aasaani se puunji or shram ko alag uddeshy ke liye prayukt kiya ja saktaa he
 There is generally little or no mobility potential seen in land as a factor of production
 ofshoring par puunji gatishiltaa ke prabhaav par vyapak rup se charchaa kii gai he
 In microeconomics, a corporation must have the ability to spend working capital to bear the initial cost of offshoring
 agar sarkaar baari taur par viniyamit karti he ki kaise ek nigam apni kaaryshil puunji kharch kar saktaa hai, vah apane parichaalanon ko ofshor karne main sakasham nahin hoga
 For this reason macroeconomics must be free for offshoring success
 aam taur par, jo ofshoring kaa paksh lete hai ve puunji gatishiltaa kaa samarthan karte hai or jo ofshoring kaa virodh karte hai ve atyadhik viniman chaahate hai
 Labor mobility also plays a major role and is also hotly debated
 jab computer or internet ne kaam ko electronic rup se portable bana diya, mukt bazaar kii taaqatein seva udyog main kaary kii vaishvik gatishiltaa main parinat huin
 adhikansh siddhant jo bahes karte hai ki ofshoring antat gharelu kamgaaron ko laabh pahunchaata he, yah maan kar chalate hai ki ve karmchaaree nae rojgaar praapt karne main sakasham ho jaaenge, bhale hi unhen khud ke avamulyan dwaara yaa nae kshetra main swayan ke punah prashikshan dwaara rojgaar paane ke liye waapas shram bazaar main janaa pade
 videshi kamgaaron ko nai naukari or oonchi mazdooree kaa laabh miltaa he jab kaam unke paas aata he
 In the developed world, the issue of moving jobs out of the country was seen at least in the 1960s and has continued since then
 mukhya rup se isaki visheshta rahi he viksit deshon se vikasshil deshon main kaarkaanon ko sthanantarit karnaa
 This offshoring and closure of factories led to a structural change from industrial to post-industrial service societies in developed countries

 In addition, the development of the Internet, in particular fiber optic intercontinental greater expansion capacity, and the World Wide Web reduced the "transportation costs" of many types of information functions to almost zero

 Prior to the 1990s, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union

 This system is also prevalent in some other countries
 bharat ke kendriya evam pradeshik shashan kaa bhi yah ang he
 In general, it is a body of politicians elected from among the members of the party or group of parties that has a majority or who can get a majority in the Lok Sabha of Parliament

 Public opinion by Lok Sabha controls the government and Lok Sabha by its majority controls the government

 The government includes all the ministers, parliamentary secretaries etc
 whose tenure is political

 cabinet ke sabhi sadsy sansad ke sadsy hote hai yaa niyukti ke thode samay ke baad hi unhen sadsy nirvaachit ho janaa anivaary hota he
 In India, sometimes the members nominated by the government in the Legislative Council are also taken into the cabinet, but this is the exception

 sarvatra pradhanmantri vaidhanik pradhan dwaara manonith hota he, vah chaahe raja ho yaa raashtrapati, governor general ho yaa governor
 In practice, this is through nominal political conditions

 Generally, a leader of the majority party is invited to form the government

 But even in such situations the decision of the statutory head is controlled
 manonith vyakti ke liye aisi sthiti main hona aavashyak he ki vah aisi sarkaar bana sake jo vyavasthapika kaa samarthan praapt kar sake
 Cabinet members are expected to work jointly
 vah vyavasthapika ke, desh ke or vaidhanik pradhan ke saamne apane ko ek sanyukt rup main prastut kare
 Hence mutual differences are resolved secretly in cabinet meetings
 samast sadasyon se apeksha kii jaati he ki ve cabinet ke sabhi nirnyon kaa anumodan, yadi aavashyak ho to, bhaashan or matdaan dwaara karen
 The responsibility of the cabinet is considered collective, if a minister acts independently by disregarding the vote of his colleagues, he is removed and forced to resign

 The cabinet system works more successfully where there are two well-organized parties - one ruling and the other in opposition and realizing that if the government collapses, the responsibility of running the government can fall on it
 at: vah puure uttardaayitv ke saath shashan kii kamajoriyon kaa udghaatan karata rahe
 The opposing side does not come under criticism for criticism, with the idea of reforming the direct regime and for favoring public opinion so that it can succeed in appealing to the electors on another occasion

 After the election of 1665, in which the Whig party had a majority in the House of Commons, it formed the cabinet on a cohesive basis from among the Whig members of the Parliament, instead of appointing ministers from both parties
 is mantrimandal ko logon ne 'janda' naam se pukaara kyonki yah gupt rup se or ek samooh kii bhanti kaam karata tha
 The Parliament expressed great dissatisfaction with this - they cannot be punished because their actions are not known
 falat: 1710 i

 In the last years of the reign of Queen Anne, there was some progress towards the cabinet system
 mantri log paraamarsh ke liye or saare sarkari kaamon main nirnay lene ke liye jab bhi aavashyaktaa hoti, hwite haul main senior secretary ov state ke daftar main mila karte or saamanyat: saptaah main ek baar rani ke cabinet main upasthit hote ore rajkaaj tathaa apane nirnay se use avgat karaate
 The conventions of the Privy Council had only formal functions

 As the reign of George i in 1714 and the ruling of the Whig party continued to hold power for 46 years, the practice of ministers' rule without the king's intervention became firm
 raja ne cabinet ke adhiveshnon main jab anupasthit rahanaa aarambh kar diya tab cabinet kaa sara daayitv pradhanmantri par aa padaa or tab cabinetrupi sanstha kaa vaastavik janm hua
 In 1721–42, Robert Walpole made a successful attempt to establish his honorable position and set a general policy of governance when ruling
 unhone apane sahyogiyon se sahyog praapt kar raja ore parlment ke saamne sanyukt morcha banaaya ore apni niti kaa samarthan na karne vaale townsend or chesterton jaise sahyogiyon ko padatyag karne par vivash kiya
 He urged that the election of ministers be left to him
 unhone parlment kaa avlamb lekar shashan kiya, kintu tabatak dalon ke sanghathan or anushaasan kaa vikaas nahin hua tha, unhen apane bal or sangrakshan kaa upyog karnaa padaa ore parlment par adhikaar rakhane ke liye ghoosekhori ore bhrashtachar kii sharan leni padi
 But when he could not get the support of the Parliament in 1742, he relinquished the post and established the tradition of resigning by the Cabinet when he was elected to the House of Commons and Pitt was able to appeal to the electors by the Prime Minister against the House of Commons Established the tradition

 kaha jaataa ki ek baar vrudhdavastha main ve kisi kuen par baithe the
 Some women who came to fill the water addressed him as Baba

 Keshav Alankar was a sectarian poet
 isaliye swaabhaavik tha ki ve bhamah, udbhat or dandi aadi alankaar sampradaay ke aacharyon kaa anusaran karte
 He considered two distinctions of ornaments, ordinary and specific
 saadhaaran ke antargat varnan, varnya, bhumishri-varnan or rajyashri-varnan aate he jo kavyakalpaltavriti or alankarishekhar par aadhaarit hai
 In this way they do not distinguish between rhetoric and ornamentation
 alankaaron ke prati vishesh ruchi hone ke kaaran kavyapaksh dab gaya he or saamanyat: ye sahruday kavi nahin maane jate
 They have been called the phantom of difficult poetry due to their attrition
 vishisht prabandhkavy ramchandrika prabadhanirvaah, maarmik sthalon kii pahchaan, prakrutivarnan aadi kii drushti se shreshth nahin he
 There is a glut of narratives due to tradition and incorporating more and more embellishments
 chahal-pahal, nagarshobha, saajasja aadi ke varnan main inkaa man adhik rama he
 In the planning of dialogues, they have achieved particular success due to the incorporation of dramatic elements
 prabandhon kii apeksha muktakon main inaki saralata adhik sthalon par vyakt hui he

 anya darbari kaviyon kii bhaanti unhone bhi apane ashrayadata raajaaon kaa yashogaan kiya he
 Veer Singh Dev Charit and Jahangir Jas Chandrika are his similar compositions

 In kavi-priya and rasik-priya, he translated Sanskrit traits, texts and wrote his poems as an example
 ram chandrika kaa vishay ram-bhakthi he kintu keshav kavi pehle the, bhakt baad main
 Therefore, they have more of a performance of poetic-miracle than devotion
 vigyaan gita main keshav ne vairaygy se sambandhit bhaawanaaon ko vyakt kiya he
 Keshav did not remain in nature due to being in the decoration of the courts
 unka prakruti-chithran dosha-purna he
 There is more of the ruthlessness of tradition, less of originality and novelty
 varnan karne main kahin-kahin keshav ne kaal or sthaan kaa bhi dhyaan nahin rakhaa he
 Nature, burdened with ornaments, has lost its enduring beauty
 prakruti ke sambandh main keshav kii kalpanaaen kahin-kahin par badi asangat or aruchikar ho gai hai
 To make Arun Surya a blood-filled skull of Kapalika period would seem like a test
 darbari kavi hone ke kaaran keshav main rajdarbaron kii vakpatutaa vartmaan thi
 Hence, he had exceptional success in the planning of dialogues
 unke samvaad atyant aakarshak hai
 They have the same sentiment and courtesy as the courts
 unke dwaara charitron kaa uddhatan sundar dhang se hua he
 janaka-vishwamitra dialogues, luv-kusha dialogues, sita-hanuman dialogues are similar dialogues

 atah unke kavy main kalpana or mastishk ko yoga adhik he
 His attention was not as much about erudition-performance
 paanditya-pradarshan kii isi pravriti ke kaaran kuch aalochakon ne keshav ko hriday-hin kavi kaha he, kintu yah aarope purnatah satya nahin, kyonki paanditya pradarshan ke saath-saath keshav ke kavy main aise anekanek sthal hai jahaan unki bhavukta or sahrudayatapurna saakaar ho uthi he
 In Ashoka Vatika, Hanuman ji gives Ramchandra ji's ring to Sita ji
 mudrika ke prati sita ji kaa kathan kitna bhavpurn he- Keshava made Brajbhasha the medium of his poetry, but the molded form of Brajbhasha found in poets of Sura etc
 Ashta Imprint is not in the poetry of Keshava
 keshav sanskrit ke prakand pandit the, atah unki bhashaa sanskrit se atyadhik prabhavit he
 He has adopted not only the corresponding words of Sanskrit, but also the variations of Sanskrit, in some places the language of his verses seems to be Sanskrit- keshav kii bhashaa main bundelkhandi bhashaa kaa bhi kaafii mishran miltaa he
 Bundeli words like Kharak, Thorilla, Dugai, Gaurmadine etc
 were used in his poetry
 avadhi bhashaa ke shabdon kaa bhi prayog miltaa he
 Such as here, here, show, show, etc
 keshav ne kahin-kahin to shabdon ko garh liya he
 Like - arc to arc
 aprachlit shabdon ke prayog main bhi unhone puri tarah svachhndatha se kaam liya
 Such as - light, launch, woman etc
 jal ke arth main vish shabd kaa prayog keshav kii bhashaa main hi miltaa he - Due to the immense influence of Sanskrit and Bundelkhandi, the use of obsolete words, long word-planning, etc
, Keshava's language has come to some degree of special illusion
 keshav kii bhashaa kaa saamaanya rup apekshaakrit sugam he
 Sayings and idioms have also been used in this place
 laaj maranaa kahawat kaa ek prayog dekhie - The impression of his personality on Keshav's style is clearly visible in this regard, he did not follow any of his former poets
 anek kaviyon kii kavitaaon ke bich unki kavita ko saralata se pahichaana ja saktaa he
 In short, Keshav's style is mature and serious
 paanditya-pradarshan ke kaaran vah kuch duruh ho gai he
 Keshav Das ji has given a great eulogy to various juices at many places in his poetry, but mainly he is a poet of Shringar and Veer Ras
 shringaar ke donon pakshon ko unhone apanaaya he
 They do not keep their touch in the poignant description of heroic enthusiasm
 shatrughna ke baanon se moorchhit lav ke liye vilaap karti hui sita ke prati kush kaa kathan kitna utsaahpurn he _ Keshav's knowledge of the verses was immense
 jitne prakaar ke chhandon kaa prayog unhone kiya hindi sahitya main kisi ne nahin kiya
 In Ramachandrika, the variety of verses has reached such a extent that scholars have called it a museum of words
 keshav ne swatah likhaa he - Keshav's verses plan is the verses plan of Sanskrit literature
 unhone kavita, savaiya, doha aadi chhandon kaa bhi safaltaapurvak upyog kiya he
 According to Keshav, he had a special love for ornaments - atah unki kavita main vibhinn alankaaron kaa prayog sarvatra dikhaai detaa he
 Poetry expressions have been overwhelmed by the burden of embellishments and the reader feels only a miracle
 jahaan alankaar-yojana prati keshav ko kathor aagrah nahin he, vahaan unki kavita atyant hridaygrahi or saras hai
 See an example of upma-ornamentation - After dasharatha-maran, when Bharat enters the palace, he finds the mothers like trees without creepers
 keshav dasji hindi sahitya ke pratham acharya hai
 In Hindi, he was the first to discuss various parts of poetry in the classical method
 yah thik he ki unke kavy main bhav paksh kii apeksha kala paksh kii pradhanta he or paanditya pradarshan ke kaaran unhen kathin kavy ke pret kah kar pukaara jaataa he kintu unka mahatv bilkul samaapt nahin ho jaataa
 In the words of Acharya Ramchandra Shukla, in the composition of Keshava, even if the simplicity and tenacity of the tone, basil etc
 were not there, but by giving a detailed introduction to the Kavyangas, he opened the way for further
 keshavadas ji vastutah ek shreshth kavi the
 After Sur and Tulsi, only those are counted in Hindi-poetry world

 ucch adhyayan ke dauraan vah apni nijee aamadani ke liye bacchon ko tution padhaane kaa kaam bhi karte rahe
 In 1908 he also wrote a research article to obtain the title of MA
 is samay unki aayu maatr bees varsh kii thi
 This increased his knowledge of the scriptures
 sheeghra hi unhone vedon or upanishdon kaa bhi gahan adhyayan kar liya
 Apart from this, he also studied Hindi and Sanskrit language very interestingly
 shiksha kaa prabhaav jahaan prayek vyakti par nishchit rup se padataa he, vahiin shaikshik santhaan kii gunvattta bhi apana prabhaav chhodti he
 At that time Western values of life were deeply instilled within the students by Christian institutions
 yahi kaaran he ki chrishchiyan sansthaaon main adhyayan karte hue radhakrishnan ke jivan main ucch gun samahit ho gayi
 But there was also another change in them which was due to Christian institutions
 kuch log hindutvvaadi vichaaron ko hey drushti se dekhte the or unki aalochana karte the
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan took his criticism as a challenge and started to study Hindu scriptures deeply
 dow radhakrishnan yah jaananaa chaahate the ki vastutah kis samskruti ke vichaaron main chetanta he or kis samskruti ke vichaaron main jadta he? tab swaabhaavik antarpragna dwaara is baat par dridhtaa se vishwaas karnaa armbh kar diya ki bharat ke duurastha sthanon par rahane vaale garib tathaa anpadh vyakti bhi pracheen satya ko jaanate the
 For this reason Radhakrishnan came to know comparatively that Indian spirituality is very rich and criticisms of Hinduism by Christian missionaries are baseless
 isse inhone yah nishkarsh nikaala ki bhartiya samskruti dharm, gyaan or satya par aadhaarit he jo praani ko jivan kaa sachcha sandesh detii he
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan had well known that life is very short but the happiness prevailing in it is uncertain
 is kaaran vyakti ko sukh-dukh main sambhaav se rahanaa chaiye
 In fact, death is an unshakable truth, which makes the rich poor all their grass and does not make any kind of class distinction
 sachcha gyaan vahi he jo aapke andar ke agyaan ko samaapt kar saktaa he
 a life of simplistic contentment is better than the egoistic life of the rich, in whom dissatisfaction resides
 ek shant mastishk behatar he, taaliyon kii un gadgadahaton se; jo sansadon evam darbaron main sunaayi detii hai
 In fact, this is why Dr
 Radhakrishnan was able to understand the moral values of Indian culture, because he wanted to test the truth of the criticisms made by the missionaries themselves
 isiilie kaha gaya he ki aalochanaayen parishuddhi kaa kaary karti hai
 All mothers want to see higher values in their children
 isi kaaran ve bacchon ko ishwar par vishwaas rakhane, paap se dur rahane evam musiibat main phase logon kii madad karne kaa paath padhaati hai
 Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan also learned that respect for all religions has been taught in Indian culture and the sense of equality for all religions is also a unique identity of Hindu culture
 is prakaar unhone bhartiya samskruti kii vishisht pahchaan ko samajha or uske kaafii nazadik ho gayi
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan considered the whole world as a school
 unka maananaa tha ki shiksha ke dwaara hi maanav mastishk kaa sadupyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, the world should manage education as a single entity
 britain ke edinbura vishvavidhyalay main diye apane bhaashan main dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne kaha tha- "maanav ko ek hona chahie
 The complete goal of human history is the liberation of mankind only when the basis of the policies of the countries is to try to establish peace all over the world
 " dow radhakrishnan apni buddhi se paripurna vyakhyaaon, anandadaayi abhivyaktiyon or halki gudgudane vaali kahaniyon se chaatro ko mantramugdh kar dete the
 He also used to motivate his students to adopt high moral values in their conduct
 vah jis bhi vishay ko padhaate the, pehle swayan uskaa gahan adhyayan karte the
 He used to make even a serious subject like philosophy, simple, interesting and dear to his style
 1909 main 21 varsh kii umr main dow radhakrishnan ne madras presidency college main kanishtha vyaakhyaata ke taur par darshan shaastra padhaanaa prarambh kiya
 It was his best fortune that he got a livelihood suited to his nature
 yahan unhone 7 varsh tak na keval adhyaapan kaary kiya apitu swayan bhi bhartiya darshan or bhartiya dharm kaa gaharaai se adhyayan kiya
 In those days, it was necessary for the lecturer that he should also get training for teaching
 isi kaaran 1910 main radhakrishnan ne shikshan kaa prashikshan madras main lenaa armbh kar diya
 At this time, his salary was only 37 rupees
 darshan shaastra vibhaag ke tatkaaleen profesar radhakrishnan ke darshan shastreey gyaan se kaafii abhibhoot hue
 They allowed him to be absent from philosophy classes
 lekin iske badale main yah shart rakhi ki vah unke sthaan par darshanashastra kii kakshaon main padhaa den
 Then Radhakrishna gave thirteen such impressive lectures to his classmates, which surprised even those learners
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki unki vishay par gahari pakad thi, darshan shaastra ke sambandh main drushtikon spasht tha or vyaakhyaan dete samay unhone upyukt shabdon kaa chayan bhi kiya tha
 a short booklet titled "essential Elements of Psychology" by Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was also published in 1912 which was a collection of his lectures given in class
 is pustika ke dwaara unki yah yogyata pramanit hui ki "prayek pad kii vyakhya karne ke liye unke paas shabdon kaa atul bhandar to he hi, unki samaran shakti bhi atyant vilakshan he
 " jab dow radhakrishnan europe evam america pravaas se punah bharat laute to yahan ke vibhinn vishvavidhyalayon ne unhen maanad oopaadhiyaan pradaan kar unki vidvatta kaa sammaan kiya
 In the winter of 1928, he first met Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru when he came to Calcutta to attend the annual session of the Congress Party
 yadhyapi sarvapalli radhakrishnan bhartiya shaikshik seva ke sadsy hone ke kaaran kisi bhi raajnneetik sambhaashan main hissedari nahin kar sakate the, tathaapi unhone is varjana kii koi parvaah nahin kii or bhaashan diya
 In 1929, he was invited by the 'university of Manchester' to give lectures
 inhone maanchester evam landan main kai vyaakhyaan diye
 The following institutional service functions are seen in the scope of their educational achievements- sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne aisa hi kiya or thik raatri 12 baje apane sambodhan ko viraam diya
 None other than Pandit Nehru and Radhakrishnan were aware of this
 azaadi ke baad unase aagrah kiya gaya ki vah mathrubhumi kii seva ke liye vishisht rajdoot ke rup main soviet sangh ke saath rajanyik kaaryon kii purti karen
 Thus, he was chosen as the new successor of Vijayalakshmi Pandit
 pandit nehru ke is chayan par kai vyaktiyon ne aashcharya vyakt kiya ki ek darshanashastri ko rajanyik sevaaon ke liye kyon chunaa gaya? unhen yah sandeh tha ki doctor radhakrishnan kii yogyataayen saunpi gai zimmedaari ke anukool nahin hai
 But Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan later proved that he was the best Indian diplomat appointed in Moscow
 ve ek gaiyr paramparawaadi rajanyik the
 Mantras which were late at night, they used to participate in them till 10 o'clock in the night, because after that their sleeping time was over
 jab radhakrishnan ek shikshak the, tab bhi ve niyamon ke daayaron main nahin bandhe the
 He used to come 20 minutes late to class and leave ten minutes earlier
 inkaa kahana tha ki kaksha main inhen jo vyaakhyaan dena hota tha, vah 20 minute ke paryaapt samay main sampann ho jaataa tha
 Even after this, he remained the beloved and respected teacher of the students
 1952 main soviet sangh se aane ke baad doctor radhakrishnan uparashtrapati nirvaachit kiye gayi
 a new post of Vice President was created under the Constitution
 nehru ji ne is pad hetu radhakrishnan kaa chayan karke punah logon ko chaunkaa diya
 He wondered why no Congress party politician was elected for the post
 uparashtrapati ke rup main radhakrishnan ne rajyasabha main adhyaksh kaa padbhaar bhi sambhaala
 In 1952, he became the Vice President of India
 baad main pandit nehru kaa yah chayan bhi sarthak siddh hua, kyonki uparashtrapati ke rup main ek gaiyr raajnneetijna vyakti ne sabhi raajnneetigyon ko prabhavit kiya
 All the members of Parliament appreciated him for his work
 inaki sadashyata, dridhtaa or vinodi swabhaav ko log aaj bhi yaad karte hai
 The birthday of Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the second but unique President of our country, is celebrated every year as 'teacher's Day'
 is din samast desh main bharat sarkaar dwaara shreshth shikshakon ko puraskaar bhi pradaan kiya jaataa he
 Although he was conferred with the title of "sir" by the British Empire in 1931, his justification for Dr
 Radhakrishnan had ended after attaining independence
 jab ve uparashtrapati ban gayi to swatantra bharat ke pratham raashtrapati dow rajendra prasad ji ne 1954 main unhen unki mahaan darshanik va shaikshik uplabdhiyon ke liye desh kaa sarvocch alankaran bharat ratna pradaan kiya

 vayumandal kitni dur tak failaa hua he, iskaa thik thik pataa hamen nahin he, par yah nishchit he ki prithvi ke chaturdik kai sau milon tak yah failaa hua he
 The lower part of the atmosphere is called troposphere, its top portion is stratosphere and its upper part is the middle circle and its top part is called ionosphere
 kshobhamandal or samtapmandal ke bich ke bich ke bhaag ko "shantmandal" or samtapmandal or inmandal ke bich ko stratopose kehete hai
 Generally, the top floor is very quiet
 praaniyon or padpon ke jeevanposhan ke liye vaayu atyaavashyak he
 It also has a profound effect on weathering of the earth
 naanaa prakaar kii bhautik or rasinic kriyaayein vayumandal kii vaayu ke kaaran hi sampann hoti hai
 Many views of the atmosphere, such as rainbows, lightning and whirling, North Polar Light, South Polar Light, Halo, Kirit, Marichika, etc
 are caused by light or electricity
 vayumandal kaa ghanatv ek sa nahin rahata
 Air pressure at sea level is equal to the pressure of a column of 760 millimeters of mercury
 upar uthne se dabaav main kami hoti jaati he
 Change in temperature or location also causes a difference in pressure
 surya kii laghutarang vikiran urja se prithvi garam hoti he
 Radiation of long-lived physical energy from the Earth is absorbed into the atmosphere
 isse vayumandal kaa taap - 68 degree celsius se 55 degree celsius ke bich hi rahata he
 Ultraviolet light above 100 km converts oxygen molecules into ions and atoms into electrons
 isi se is mandal ko inmandal kehete hai
 At night, these ions or electrons then merge together into a molecule or atom, causing green and red lines to appear in the night light
 prithvi ke chaaron ore saikado kimi kii motaai main lapetane vaale gasiy aavaran ko vayumandal kehete hai
 The atmosphere is a mixture of various gases that surround the earth
 nichle staron main vayumandal kaa sanghatan apekshaakrit ek samaan rahata he
 Changes in relative amounts of gases are found in height
 shuddh or shushk vaayu main nitrogen 78 pratishat, oxigen, 21 pratishat, argon 0
93 pratishat carbon daai oxide 0
03 pratishat tathaa hydrogen, helium, ozone, nion, jenan, aadi alp maatra main upasthit rahati hai
 The amount of water vapor in the humid atmosphere is up to 5 percent
 vayumandi jal vaashp kii prapti sagaron, jalaashyon, vanaspatiyon tathaa mrudaaon ke jal se hoti he
 The amount of water vapor decreases from the equator towards the poles
 jal vaashp ke kaaran hi badal, koharaa, paala, varsha, os, him, ola, himpat hota he
 The ozone layer has a very important role in the atmosphere for the Earth and the organisms living on it
 yah parat surya se aane vaali ucch aavriti kii parabangnee prakaash kii 93-99% maatra avashoshit kar leti he, jo prithvi par jivan ke liye hanikaarak he
 The ozone layer was discovered in 1913 by the French physicists Fabry Charles and Henry Busson
 prithvital par kii shushk vaayu kaa ausat sanghathan is prakaar he- The atmosphere acts as a huge 'glass house' to keep the heat in check, allowing small waves and radiation to come to the Earth's surface, but prevents the waves from the Earth from going out
 is prakaar vayumandal prithvi par sam taapmaana banaae rakhata he
 In addition to water vapor and gases in the atmosphere, microscopic solid particles are also present
 vayumandaleey ardrata vaayu main upasthit jalawaashp ke upar nirbhar karti he
 This water vapor remains in the lower levels of the atmosphere
 isaki maatra sabhi sthanon main tathaa sadaiv ek si nahin rahati
 There are differences in it over time
 yah jalawaashp nadi, talab, jhil, sagar aadi ke jal ke vashpikaran se banataa he
 Two things should be noted in atmospheric humidity: vayumandaleey ardrata ko mukhyat: do prakaar ke maapiyon se maapte hai: The sun is the source of atmospheric heat
 vaayu ko surya kii apeksha prithvi ke sansparsh se adhik ooshmaa milti he, kyonki usapar dhulikanon kaa prabhaav padataa he
 These dust particles, which are bad conductors of heat, are higher on and near the earth's surface and decrease in height in the atmosphere
 at: prarambh main surya kii kirane dharaatal ko garam karti hai
 Then the same heat is transmitted from the lower level of the atmosphere to the upper level respectively by conducting
 iske atirikt garam hokar vaayu upar uthati he, rikt sthaan kii purti apekshaakrit thandhi vaayu karti he; phir vah bhi garam hokar upar uthati he
 As a result, convection currents are generated
 at: ooshmaa ke upar failane main sanchaalan or sanvaahan kaam karte hai
 Atmospheric pressure or pressure is the weight of the column of the atmosphere over the unit area of a place
 kisi bhi samtal par vayumandal dabaav uske upar kii vaayu kaa bhaar hota he
 This pressure decreases quickly with elevation near the earth's crust, and gradually at higher altitudes in the atmosphere
 parantu kisi bhi sthaan par vaayu kii oonchaai ke saapeksh sthir nahin rahata he
 It varies with the change of seasons and seasons
 vayumandaleey dabaav vibhinn vayudabamapiyon dwaara napa jaataa he
 Atmospheric pressure at sea level is equal to 760 mm of parastatic pressure
 inkaa arth ek hi he
 Based on this, on the map it is represented by isobar lines
 inhen par vaayu-bhaar-petiyaan, hawaaon kii disha, veg, disha parivartan aadi nirbhar karte hai
