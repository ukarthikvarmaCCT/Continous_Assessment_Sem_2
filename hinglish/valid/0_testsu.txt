 According to some ancient Greek philosophers, such as Aristotle, according to the father of Aristotle Physics, "there is a reason behind every event", it may be the first such idea and theoretical thought is very helpful in understanding nature
 jabaki ek aadhunik pathak ke liye ye vichaar bahut uchit najar aate hai, yahan ek suspasht ganithiya siddhant or niyantrit praayogic khamiyaan shaamil thi
 They originated from fixed mechanics and play a decisive role in the making of modern physics

 The position of a point particle is defined in a reference system in a macro system relative to the randomly stationary reference point O, where the reference point o is located at the point
 ise bindu o se kan tak sadish r dwaara paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Normally the point particle does not have to be constant with respect to O, so r is a function of time

 Newton first expressed mathematically the relationship between momentum and force
 kuch bhautik vigyaani newton ke gati ke dwitiya niyam ko dravyaman evam bal kii paribhaasha ke rup main dekhte hai, jabaki anya ise prakruti kaa niyam evam ek moolbhoot abhigruhit maanate hai
 The second explanation is the mathematical result historically known as "newton's Second Law": jahaan raashi mv ko kan samveg kaha jaataa he
 Hence, the total force acting on the particle will be equal to the rate of change in the particle's momentum
 chunki twaran kii paribhaashanusaar a = dv / dt, dwitiya niyam ko saral rup main nimna prakaar likhaa ja saktaa he: Therefore, when the force acting on a particle is known, Newton's second law is sufficient to understand its motion
 jab kan par karyrat sabhi balon ke swatantra sambandh gyaat hone par, saadhaaran avakal sameekaran praapt karne ke liye newton ke dwitiya niyam main rakhaa ja saktaa he jise gati kii sameekaran kaha jaataa he
 As an example, suppose that only the friction force is acting on a particle and it can be written as a function of the particle's velocity: jahaan λ ek dhanatmak niyatank he
 Hence the equation of motion will be as follows ise samaklit karne par Where v0 is the initial velocity
 arthath kan kaa veg charghaatanki rup se kam ho rahaa he or samay ke saath shunya kii or agrasar he
 In this state, an equivalent approach can be given that the kinetic energy of the particle is being absorbed by friction and the particle is damping
 is sameekaran ko kan kii sthiti r ko samay ke falan ke rup main gyaat karne ke liye aage bhi samaklit kiya ja saktaa he
 The main forces are Lorents force for gravitational force and electromagnetism

 Symbolism or totem practice refers to the belief of a society in which humans are considered to be related to an animal, tree, plant or other soul
 'totum' shabd ojibve naamak mul america adivasee qabeele kii bhashaa ke 'ototeman' se liya gaya he, jiskaa matlab 'apana bhai / bahan rishtedaar' he
 Its root word is 'ote' which means brothers and sisters born to the same mother, who have a blood relationship and who cannot marry each other
 aksar totum vaale jaanavar yaa vriksh kaa use maanane vaale qabeele ke saath vishesh sambandh mana jaataa he or use maarna yaa haani pahunchaana varjit hota he, yaa phir use kisi vishesh avasar par yaa vishesh vidhi se hi maaraa ja saktaa he
 Clan people also often include it in clan symbols, for example Native American tribes often displayed it in totem pillars
 bharat ke bahut se samudaayon main bhi aise totum paae jate hai
 For example, it is seen that in Maharashtra people bearing the family name of 'tambe' consider Nag as their totem and never kill Nag
 19veen sadi main satapura ke jangalon main rahane vaale bhil logon main dekha gaya ke har gut kaa ek totum jaanavar yaa vriksh tha, jaise ki patange, saanp, sher, mor, bans, pipal, vakairaah
 The tot of one faction was a creeper named 'gavala', on which if a member of that faction accidentally stepped on it, he saluted him and apologized to him
 agar do guton kaa ek hi totum ho to unamem aapas main vivaah karnaa varjit tha kyonki vah ek hi purvaj ke vanshaj maane jate the
 There was a peacock of the Bhil faction called 'mori'

 If the peacock is seen then, the Mori women would cover it or face it on the other side
 pashu-pakshi, vriksh-paudhon par vyakti, gana, jati yaa janajati kaa namakaran atyant prachlit saamaajik pratha he jo sabhy or asabhy donon prakaar ke samaajon main pain jaati he
 This practice is very prevalent in uncultured societies and sometimes it also has the form of tribal religion
 uttari america ke pashchimi tat par rahanevaali haida, tilliggit, kwakitul aadi janajatiyon main pashu aakaar ke vishaal or bhayanak khambhe paae jate hai, jinhen in jatiyon ke log devtaa maanate hai
 For these, the words Todem, Ododem etc
 are used in these castes, whose sound is in the word totem
 madhya austrailia ke arunta adivasee, africa ke purvi madhya pradeshon tathaa bharat kii janajatiyon main yah pratha prachlit hai
 Different forms of this practice are found in different regions of the world

 According to this table, sansar main ganchihnavaad ke lakshan sab kahin ek se nahin paye jate
 For example, iconography is a social practice among the Haida and Tillingit castes, but its religious form is not developed
 madhya austrailia kii arunta jati main totem-dharm or reetiyaan purna viksit hai, totemi pashu kii nakal yaa swaang nahin utaarte
 The religious form of iconography is unattainable in the Bangada caste of Africa

 Traditions of totem-sacrifice and totem-worship are not found there

 In Chotanagpur and Madhya Pradesh, pictures of totems are seen on the walls of houses

 In many other tribes, totems are painted on all the clothes, weapons, tools and flags
 visheshat: uttari america or austrailia kii adivasee kala par ganchihn kaa prabhaav bahut gaharaa he
 The members of the totem consider themselves to be supernatural and psychic children of the totem

 Thus the practice of extraterritorialism in totemistic societies is valid
 sar james fckejar kaa vichaar he ki totemwad or bahirvivaah main kaarykaran kaa sambandh he or ve sadaiv saath saath paae jate hai
 The members of the totemi consider blood to be bloodshed due to the totem being a supernatural symbol and do not intermarry for this reason
 bharat main anek totemi jatiyaan hai
 There are more than hundred such ganas in the Santhal caste, whose names are placed on animals, birds and trees
 isi prakaar dakshin bihar kii hi jati main lagbhag pachaas aise totemi gana he
 The Bhils of Rajasthan and Khandesh are divided into 24 ganas, many of which seem to be based on animal herds and trees
 maharashtra ke katakaree, madhyapradesh ke gond or rajasthan ke minaa, milaala aadi jatiyon main bhi ganon ke naam unke pradesh main paae janevaale pashupakshiyon par rakhe jate hai
 Along with the name Totemi Gana, many of the features of totemism are present in all these castes such as treating totem as supernatural ancestors, the objects of the totem and the pictures and signs of the totem are also worshiped as sacred and harsh on destroying the totem
 There is a restriction
 inke saath hi bharat main aisi anek jatiyaan hai jo totem par apane gana athwa samudaay kaa keval naam rakhti he
 There are many who worship only the totem
 majumdaar ne bengal main rahanevaali aisi anek jatiyaan kaa ullekh kiya he
 There are many such castes in Malwa and Rajasthan in which there is no other symptom of totemism except the name
 yah kahana thik nahin hoga ki pashu-pakshi-vrikshon ke poojak sadaiv hi totemvaadi hua karte hai
 In various sects of Hindus, cow, buffalo, monkey, rat, owl, snake, peacock etc
 are worshiped as sacred
 isi prakaar tulsi, bilva, ashwatth or bat kaa pavitra maanakar puujate hai
 But it would be inconsistent to call these sects totemists because they neither name the totem on the totem nor do the members of the guana consider the totem of the totem
 rijgaye kaa vichaar he ki bharat kii ve sab jatiyaan jinamein totemwad kaa ek bhi lakshan paaya jaataa he prarambh main purna rup se totemvaadi thim
 They gradually stopped worshiping their various totems, and now totems are found in them only in the form of Gannam and Ganchaman

 Poetry of poets in Muktak was often the test of rhythm and speed
 chhandon ke vishay main abhi tak kaai moulik adhyayan nahin hua, parantu nae nae praha lagaataar chal rahe hai
 In the tendency of Urdu to use Ghazals, Kita, Ruwai, etc
, the obvious effect of local Urdu poetesses is targeted

 a comet is a solar system that consists of small blocks made of stone, dust, ice and gas

 Comets with short paths complete the orbit of the Sun in an elliptical path in about 6 to 200 years
 kuch dhoomaketu kaa path valayakaar hota he or wo maatr ek baar hi dikhaai dete he
 Comets with long paths take thousands of years to orbit one

 The orbits of comets with short orbits are smaller than 200 years, while the orbits of long-sighted comets are under the Sun's gravity, despite being very long
 Due to the solo orbiting orbit of parabola, such comets once circled the sun and went out of the solar system forever
 The orbit of the Anke Comet with smaller orbit lies between the Sun and the Guru
 It is believed that smokers with short orbit originate in the Kuiper belt, while long-haul axes originate in the Oort cloud
 It is believed that comets hold a long orbit when the Sun passes near a star orbiting the galaxy, or when the Sun's possible companion star, Nemesis or Planet X, comes close to it
 kam dravyaman or andakaar kaksha ke kaaran dhoomaketu kabhi kabhi bade grahon kii taraf aakarshith hote he or isse uski kaksha par asar padataa he | choti kaksha vaale dhumaketuon kaa ek centre bade grahon kii kaksha ke andar sthit hota he | yah spasht he ki urt badal se aane vaale dhumaketuon kii kaksha par bade grahon kaa asar padataa he | badi sankhya main aise dhumaketuon par vishesh rup se brihaspati kaa asar padataa he jiskaa dravyaman soramandal ke anya sabhi grahon ke dravyaman se bhi zyada he | Sometimes the previously discovered comets are lost due to the effect on the orbit
 Sometimes it happens that after thorough study of the newly discovered comets, they are identified as missing comets
 11P / Temple - Swift - Linear Comet is an example of this

 internet movie database par jeophri rash Alluri Sitaram Raju was a revolutionary in India's freedom struggle
 vanavaasi swatantry priy hai, unhen kisi bandhan main athwa paradheenata main nahin jaqada ja saktaa he, isiliye unhone sabase pehle jangalon se hi videshi aakrantaon evam damankaariyon ke viruddh unka yah sangharsh desh ke swatantra hone tak nirantar chalata rahaa
 Today we can say that the plan of freedom started from the dunes of the forests
 yah prakruti putr hai, isiilie jangalon se hi swatantraaa kaa alakh jagaaya
 There are a long chain of such forest loving revolutionaries
 kai paridrishy main chhaaai rahe or kai anaam rahe
 Who spent their whole life in the struggle for independence
 aise hi mahaan krantikari alluri seetaram raju kaa janm 4 july 1897 ko vishakhapattanam jile ke pandrick gaanv main hua
 The revolutionary, Veer Raju also studied medicine and astrology as a personal interest along with schooling, and this study continued in his practical practice
 iske kaaran hi jab usne yuvavastha main vanavaasi samaaj ko angrejon ke khilaaf sangathit karnaa shuru kiya to in vidhaon kii jaankariyon ne use abhootpurv sahaayta pradaan kii
 Raju was raised in the family of his uncle Alluri Ramakrishna
 inke pita alluri venkat ramraaju godavari ke maggul gram main rahete the
 He gave revolutionary rites to Sitaram Raju during his childhood, telling that the British have enslaved us, who are looting the country
 in shabdon kii sikh ke saath hi pita kaa saath to chhot gaya, lekin viplav path ke beej lag chuke the
 At a young age, the forest dwellers started organizing against the exploitation of the British, which started with the treatment of the forest dwellers and giving information about the future
 yahi nahin is mahaan krantikari ne maharishi kii tarah do varsh tak sitamai naamak pabadi kii gupha main aadhyatm sadhana va yoga kriyaaon se chintan tathaa taap viksit kiya
 This was the time when Raju got to know the pestilence of forest dwellers and Girijans closely
 unhen uth khada hone ke liye prerit kiya
 Biraiahdoura's name is well-known among Raju's revolutionary companions
 biraiyadora kaa prarambh main apana alag sanghathan tha
 He was also an organization of forest dwellers who waged war with the British
 yah baat san 1918 kii he
 Anant British arrested Biraiyadaura in an encounter, kept him in jail, but he jumped the prison wall and escaped into the jungles
 uske baad biraiyadora ne dal se sampark zodkar british satta se sangram jari rakhaa
 In which he was sent to jail again
 angrej biraiyadora ko faansee par lataka dete, parantu us samay seetaram raju kaa sanghathan bahut prabal ho chukaa tha
 The police trembled with Raju
 vah british satta ko khuleam chunauti detaa tha
 For the prisoner Biraiahdoura, he had already sent information to the British power that 'I will get Biraiya released
 dam ho to roak lenaa
 'that's what happened
 ek din police dal jab biraiya ko hathkadibedi se kase adaalat le ja rahaa tha, seetaram raju ne police tuqadi par dhaava bolaa diya
 Bullets were fired from both sides, but even under the fire of bullets, the police team could not stop Raju's hair and he fought openly and took Biryadaura away
 angreji satta ke liye raju tathaa biraiya kii khoj ek samasya bani rahi
 Police raids failed
 angrejon ne use paqadwane ke liye akhabaaron va ishtaharon main das hajaar ru nagad inaam kaa elaan kiya
 In 192224, this amount was a big temptation
 gandhiji ne raju ke liye thik hi kaha tha ki ‘us viratma kaa tyagabalidaan, museebatonbharaa jivan, sachai, sevabhaavana, lagan, nishtha or adamya himmat hamaare liye preranaprad he’
 Subhash Chandra Bose had said that the countrymen should be honored in honor of that great warrior
 uski samarpanabhaavna deshaanurag, aseem dhiraj or parakram gaurav garima mandit he’
 One reason for the success of Sitaram Raju's struggle and revolution was that the forest dwellers did not know to betray their leader, betray him
 koi bhi saamaanya vyakti mubir yaa gaddaar nahin bana
 All the forest dwellers of Rampa region of Andhra used to give their shelter, self-help, to Raju
 swatantraaa sangram kii us bela main un bholebhaale gruhahin, vastraheen va sarvhaara samudaay kaa kitna kida yogadan he ki angrejon ke kode khaakar, laatghunse khaakar bhi raju ko paqadva dena unhen sweekaar nahin hua
 This is the reason why even today, in the Rampa area of godavari, no man believes that Raju was ever caught and shot by East Coast Special Police Chief Kunchu Menon
 krantikari biraiya ko british kaid se reeha kara lene par donon krantikari raju or biraiya ekajute ho gaye, ek saath kaam karne lage
 Now Raju's power doubled
 do anya krantikari gaam mallu daura or gaam ganton daura bhi raju ke dal main aa mili
 The four went on joint raids in such a way that the British got oppressed
 ve raju kaa ek bhi aadmi na to maar sake na giraftaar kar sake or raju anek vasha] tak angrej satta ko naakon chane chabaata rahaa
 Revolutionary Sitaram Raju created revolution among hundreds of youth of Andhra region
 raju ke kehane par noujvaan saath khade ho jate the, jiske aitihaasik pramaan 1928 or 1929 ke andhra main telegu main prakashit saptahik akhbaar congress main maujuud hai
 Editor Paduri Annapurnayya has written that if the youth of Andhra continued to fight with the British under the direction of someone, it was Sitaram Raju and he was the first war in the history of Andhra
 viplav path kaa pathik banakar krantikari raju ne apana sanghathan khada karne ke saath uttarakhand ke krantikariyon se sampark kiya
 Not only this, they tried their best to get Babar Prithvi Singh, the leader of the Gadar Party, from the Raj Mahendri Jail in South India
 seetaram raju gorilla paddati se yuddh karte or nallaimallai paharyon main antardhyaan ho jate
 The hills spread near the Godavari river were both shelters and training centers of Raju and his companions
 yaheen ve yuddh ke gur sikhte, abhyaas karte va akraman kii ranneeti banaate
 This place was called Rampa
 raju dwaara chakma dekar paharyon main vilupt ho jane kii vajah se angrej unhen rampa fituri kehete the
 British officers continued to beat Raju
 andhra kii police raju ke saamne vyarth sabit ho chuki thi
 Finally, the Malabar Police Squad of Kerala was put on Raju as he had experience of raiding the mountainous areas
 12 oktober 1922 ko nallaimallai kii paharyon kii ghati main ye daste ravaanaa kiye gaye
 Raju had several encounters with the Malabar Police Force
 inamen malabar daston ko munh kii khaani chhadi
 Even after that the police could not arrest Raju
 6 may 1924 ko raju ke dal kaa muqabla susajjit assam rifles se hua, jisamen uske saathi shahid ho gaye, par raju bachaa rahaa
 Now the East Coast Special Police was looking for him in the hills
 7 may 1924 ko jab vah akelaa jangal main bhatak rahaa tha, to sahasaa uski khoj main van parvaton ko chaante phir rahe force ke afasar kii najar raju par mud gai
 He followed Raju in secret
 yadhyapi vah raju ko pahchaan nahin sakaa tha, kyonki us samay raju ne lambii laadhi kidhaa lee thi
 The police team opened fire on Raju from behind
 raju jakhmi hokar vahiin gir ode
 Then Raju himself introduced himself and said that 'I am Sitaram Raju'
 The torture started with the arrest
 antat us mahaan krantikari ko nadi kinare hi ek vriksh se baandhakar bhun diya gaya
 What could have been better martyrdom of a revolutionary than this
 is balidaan ke sakshya the godavari nadi or nallaimallai kii pahadeyan, jahaan aaj bhi alluri seetaram raju jinda he

 The Chitradurga Paleyagar family belonged to the Beda or Boyar castes and was one of the hill tribes that lived by hunting and animal husbandry
 unke mul ke vishay main kuch spasht nahin he
 According to a tradition, three Beda families migrated from jadikal-durg in Tirupati around 1475 and settled at Nirutadi near Bharmasnagar

 The son and grandson of one of them, Hire Hanummappa Nayak and Timmanna Nayak settled in the Matti of Devangre taluk

 He fortified the hill of Chitradurga and started behaving in such a way that the king had to send an army against him
 According to another account, Timmanna Nayaka came with a small contingent of armed men from a place called Madakeri situated under a ghat near Tirupati and worked at Paleyagar in Basavapatnam
 baad main, matti main apni ek rakhel ke kaaran utpann hue vivaad kii vajah se usne vah sthaan chhod diya or maayconda main jaakar bas gaya
 Being chased there too, he escaped into the forest near Guntur and after forming a group of his own, started looting in that area and built a small fort called Rangapatna near Haleyur

 The prince woke up and Timmanna had to hide in a pile of straw to avoid being caught
 The prince placed the peg and rope slightly forward in the ground, inadvertently hanging Timmanna in the air
 phir bhi timmanna chupchaap chipa rahaa or sabakuch shant ho jane ke baad usne apane latake hue haath ko katkar khud ko chhudaaya or ghode ko chura liya
 His act made the besieging army realize that Timmanna could not be intimidated
 It is said that peace was established after that
 vijaynagar ke raja ne timmanna ko rajdhani aamantrit kiya or uske is saahsee krity kii bahut prashansa kii
 At the king's request, Timmanna Nayaka captured Gulberg as his next step, which Vijayanagara's forces failed to conquer even after a six-month siege
 isse khush hokar raja ne timmanna ko darbar main aamantrit kiya
 Timmanna later faced the king's displeasure for some reason and was imprisoned in Vijayanagara, where he died

 Previously, the names Kachabha and Regini were in use respectively
 san 1737 main duphe ne bataaya ki sajaateey aavesh ek duusare ko pratikarshith karte hai tathaa vijaateey aakarshith karte hai
 In 1745, Clyst in Cummin, Massenbrook in Lyden, and William Watson in London said that electricity can also be stored, their experiments and ideas gave rise to the famous accumulator Leiden Jar
 lagbhag isi samay vidyut ko paryaapt maatra main praapt karne ke praytn bhi jari the tathaa vibhinn prakaar ke vidyut yantron kaa avishkaar hua
 Willie Watson thought that electricity is a type of elastic fluid that exists in every object
 aveshvihin vastuon main yah saadhaaran maatra main hoti he at: iskaa nirikshan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 According to Watson's fluid theory, electricity moves from one object to another
 amareeki vaigyanik tathaa raajnneetijna benjamin franklin ne is siddhant kaa samarthan kar, vistaar kiya
 Franklin said that electricity can neither be generated nor destroyed
 franklin ne liden jaar kaa adhyayan kar uski kriya ko samajhane kii cheshtaa kii
 But Franklin's most famous and important experiment was that, in which he proved that the properties of electricity and ordinary electricity are similar at the time of cloud to cloud
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki vidyut ke kan ek duusare par bal daalate hai
 After Franklin, Epinus took these ideas and gave the impression that the force of two objects decreases by increasing the distance between them
 is siddhant kaa vistaar jajef pristli tathaa henry cavendish ne kiya
 Coulom then discovered that the force between two charges is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them and the product of the charge
 vidyut kaa yah mul niyam ab bhi 'kulom kaa balanium' kaha jaataa he
 In 1837, Michael Faraday studied the effect of the medium on the electric force between any two charged objects and found that if the medium is any more insulated in place of air then the electric force decreases, this property of anti-electromagnetism
 Said to be 'uniquely eclectic
' unhone apane barf ke baratanwale prasiddh prayog dwaara darshaya ki yadi kisi aaweshit chaalak kaa ek baratan main laayaa jaae, to baratan ke andar kii ore vijaateey aavesh prerit hota he tathaa baahar kii ore sajaateey awesh
 Faraday made an in-depth study of the electrodynamics and introduced the idea of electric force lines to explain their various effects and called the empty space between charged objects a 'zone'

 In the last years of the eighteenth century, many experiments and theories regarding the movement of charges were coming to light
 san 1780 main italy ke ljugi gailawani ne mechak ke upar vidyut pravaah ke kai prayog kiye
 In 1800, Volta found electrical effects in two dissimilar metals soaked with dilute acid or salt solution and obtained electric current from them
 is vidyut pravaah ko kai guna karne ke liye unhone aisi kai asmaan dhaatuon ke jodon ko lekar ek punj banaaya jise voltiy punj kehete hai
 According to these experiments by Volta, a 'voltaic Cell' was created to achieve electrification
 usee varsh england main niklson tathaa karlile ne is baat kaa pataa lagaaya ki yadi pani main vidyut dhara pravaahit kii jaae to pani ke hydrogen tathaa oxigen main apghaton ko jaataa he
 Such decomposition is called electronegative decomposition
 crukashaik ne pataa lagaaya ki vilyan ke dhaatulavan bhi isi prakaar apaghatit kiye ja sakate hai
 After this Faraday regularly studied this action and established 'faraday's rules'
 in niyamon athwa inase sambandhit prayogon ke aadhaar par vidyut dhara utpaadan karanevaale vibhinn prakaar ke cell tathaa sanchayakon kii rachana kii gai he
 In 1820 Hans Christian Arstad discovered that a current with a current in a wire also has a magnetic field related to it
 is mahatvapurn khoj ko kipro tathaa sawar ne or ampiore ne ganit evam prayogon kii sahaayta se aage badhaayaa
 Ampere showed that two parallel wires have attraction when the direction of electric current is the same and repulsion is opposite
 arsted ke siddhanton ko farade ne viksit kiya tathaa vidyut-chumbakeey preran ke niyamon kii sthapana kii
 Induction was also studied later by Naiman and Weber, but Clark Maxwell made significant use of the ideas of inspiration in 1851 and established 'maxwell equations' to give electromagnetic principles a solved form of mathematics
 aadhunik bhautikee main in samikarnon kaa vishesh sthaan he
 In 1822, Jabek observed that if two dissimilar metals were combined in one circuit and one joint was heated, the circuit would conduct electricity
 aisi vidyut ko 'ooshmaa vidyut' kehete hai
 In 1826, George Simon Om established the famous 'om's law'
 san 1841 main jul ne vidyut ke ooshmaa prabhaav kaa adhyayan kiya tathaa batalaaya ki kisi cell kii rasinic urja, jo paripath main dhara pravaahit karti he, us paripath main utpaadit ooshmaa urja ke baraabar hoti he
 Helm Holtz, William Tomson, Calvin, Lardon, etc
 developed other theories related to electric energy
 san 1848 main kirkhhaaf ne vidyuddhara sambandhi niyamon ko prastut kiya
 In 1851, Lord Kelvin analyzed thermodynamics by theories of thermodynamics

 Thereafter, the subject of electromagnetic waves attracted the attention of many scientists
 marconi ne san 1896 main inkaa prayog sandesh bhejne main kiya
 Around this time, Jagadishchandra Basu of India generated high-frequency electromagnetic waves and tried to explain their properties with the principles of light
