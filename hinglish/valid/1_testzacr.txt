 vah apni patni ko gahane pahanke kaa sukh nahin de pate
 The farmer's wife is there to manage with a few pieces of cloth

 The Indian farmer celebrates social celebrations in the simplest possible way
 vah har saal tyohaar dhooma se manaate he
 He would also celebrate the marriage of his sons and daughters
 vah apane parijanon or doston or padosiyon ke manoranjan bhi karne main kasar nahin chhodte
 He used to visit his relations here often
 kisaanon kii mog muft bijli or pani nahin he, balki bijli kii nirbaadh aapurti ke liye hai jiske liye ve bhugtan karne ke liye taiyaar he
 In states like Punjab, the first time Green Revolution helped the farmers a lot but due to the yield of bumper crops at low prices, their work started coming

 Small farmers also decided to start some cottage industries

 Such steps would have taken the farmers in the right direction and helped in farming for a long time

 The history of the right to recall elected representatives is very old
 pracheen kaal main anthenian loktantr se hi yah kanoon chalan main tha
 Many countries later incorporated this recall into their constitution
 vaise itihaas yah he ki is kanoon kii utpatti switsraland se hui par yah america rajyon main chalan main aayaa
 In 1903, the Municipality of Las Angeles, USA, in 1908 was first applied to the Right to Recall State Officials in Michigan and Oregon
 baat jab bhartiya paripekshya main karte hai to yah waapas bulaane kaa adhikaar yani rhite tu rikaal bihar kii jameen se upja he
 Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan first gave the slogan of Right to Recall during the entire revolution on 4 November 1974
 unhone chun kar gayi janpratinidhiyon kii vaapasi kii baat kii
 As of now, the right to recall Right to Recall means elected representatives are limited to slogans only
 is babat kisi bhi tarah ke thos kanoon ko lekar kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ne koi pahal nahin he
 The Supreme Court also said in one of its decisions that right to recall is the most important mechanism in the present situation through which people can be empowered
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne haal hi main bihar munisapal act ko sanshodhit kar rhite tu rikaal yani waapas bulaane ke adhikaar ko usamen shaamil kiya he
 The right to recall the elected chief in the Panchayati Raj system of Bihar is already here

 The department has to look at the merit of that signed application
 agar vibhaag is baat se sahamat he ki sambandhit ward counciller ne do tihaai matadaataaon kaa vishwaas kho diya he to vah ukt kanusiller ko hataa saktaa he
 The government has empowered voters to call back their elected representative when they do not like it
 rhite tu rikaal chhattisgarh main bhi lagu he
 The biggest screw in this Right to Recall is how the government officials will finally decide whether the signed application of two thirds of the voters against the councilor concerned is correct
 sach main ve us ilaake ke voter hai yaa nahin? itane bade str par hastakshar jutaney main ghapala nahin hua yah kaise sambhav he? Judicial review or judicial review or judicial review is the process under which there is a provision for the review of executive functions by the judiciary

 yadi rajya dwaara koi aisi vidhi banaai jaati he jo mul adhikaron kaa ulanghan karti he to nyaayalay usko shunya ghoshit kar saktaa he
 By this the court examines the constitutionality of the statutes
 isiilie anuchhed 13 ko 'mul adhikaron kaa prahari' bhi kaha jaataa he
 Article 13: - It states that immediately before the coming into force of the Indian Constitution, all the laws prevailing in India shall be void to the extent that they are inconsistent with the provisions of Constitution Part Three
 anuchhed 13 :- rajya aisi koi vidhi nahin banaayegaa jo mul adhikaron ko chhinti he
 Every law made in violation of this clause shall be void up to the amount of the violation

 Article 13: - This clause is added by "24th Amendment of the Constitution"
 iske anusaar is anuchhed kii koi baat anuchhed 368 ke adheen kiye gaye samvidhan sanshodhan ko lagu nahin hogi
 This article obliges the three legislative bodies, the executive and the judiciary to remain within their limits so that they do not interfere in each other's territories

 main ranthambhore kaa abhiyaan asafal rahaa
 Jalaluddin succeeded in winning the fort of Mandore and Zain in 1292 AD
 dilli ke nikatavarti kshetron main usne thagon kaa daman kiya
 In 1292 AD, Abdullah, the grandson of the Mongol invader Halaku, invaded Punjab with about one and a half million soldiers, and reached Sunam Patak, but Alauddin succeeded in defeating the Mongols and in the end there was a treaty between the two
 mongol waapas jane ke liye teyar ho gayi
 But Genghis Khan's grandson Ulagu, along with about 400 of his Mongol supporters, decided to convert to Islam and stay in India
 kaalaantar main jilaluddin ne ulgu ke saath hi apni putree kaa vivaah kiya or saath hi rahane ke liye dilli ke sameep 'mugharalpur' naam kii basti basaai gai
 Later he was known as 'naveen Muslim'
 jilaluddin ne iran ke dharmik pakir sidi maula ko hathi ke pairon tale kuchalava diya
 Although this was the only hard work of the Sultan, otherwise his policy was to be generous and to satisfy all
 jilaluddin ke shashan kaal main hi uski bhattije allaudin kilji ne shaasha banane se purv hi 1292 i
 main apane chachaa kii sweekruti ke baad bhilsa evam devgiri kaa abhiyaan kiya
 Devagiri's invasion at that time was the first invasion of South India by Muslims
 in donon abhiyaanon se allaudin ko apaar sampatti praapt hui
 The emir advised Alauddin Khilji to snatch the property on the way, but Jalaluddin paid no attention to it
 jilaluddin kilji kii hatya ke shadyantra main allaudin kilji ne apane bhai almaas veg kii sahaayta lee, jise baad main 'ulug khaan' kii oopaadhi se vibhooshit kiya gaya
 In this way, Alauddin Khilji killed his benevolent uncle and got him crowned at Lal Mahal in Balban on 22 October 1296 at Delhi's throne
 jilaluddin kilji kaa shashan udaar nirankushta par aadhaarit tha
 Due to his liberal policy, Jalaluddin had said, "I am an old Muslim and it is not my habit to shed blood of Muslims
 ” amir khusro or imami donon ne jalaluxxina kilji ko “bhagyavaadee vyakti” kaha he
 On the coronation of Alauddin Khilji, Barney states, "the blood was still dripping from the martyr Sultan's severed head, that the royal Chandoba was placed on Alauddin Khilji's head and was declared Sultan
 ” The Triratna is the most important part of Buddhism

 sextent sabase saral or sugathit yantra he jo prekshak kii kisi bhi sthiti par kinhin do binduon dwaara bana kone paryaapt yatharthata se naapane main kaam aata he
 It was invented independently by scientists such as John Hadley and Tomas Godfrey in 1730
 tab se itani avadhi guzarane par bhi yah yantra prachlit hi nahin he varan bade chaav se prayog main aata he
 The main reason for this is that more convenient features are available than other angiometer
 pehali visheshta yah he ki anya konemapi yantron kii bhanti ise prekshan ke samay ekadam sthir rakhana yaa kisi nishchit avasthaa main rakhana anivaary nahin he
 The second feature is that the position of the observer and the point on it are in horizontal, vertical or oblique plane, this device can measure the amount of actual angle made in that plane
 in visheshtaon ke kaaran sextent navik kii uski yatra kii disha kaa gyaan karaane ke liye aaj bhi bada upyog yantra he
 Two types of sextants are used
 ek, baks sextent or doosraa khagoleey yaa navik sextent
 There is no theoretical difference in the texture of the two
 inaki banaavat kaa siddhant yah he ki yadi kisi samtal main prakaash kii koi kiran aamane-saamne munh kiye khadey samtal darpanon se ek ke baad duusare par paravartit hone ke baad dekhi jaae to dekhi gai kiran or mul kiran ke bich bana kone paravartak darpanon ke bich parsparik kone se duuna hoga
 An angle of 120 ° to the sextant can be measured at once
 isse bada kone hone par do yaa adhik se adhik teen bhaag karke naapnaa hoga
 The box sextant is a small, about 8 cm diameter by four cm height
 upar kaa dhakkan khol dene par upar kuch pench or ek burneer thami hui bhujaa dikhaai degi jo anshon par uske chote bhaagon main vibhajit chaap par chal sakati he
 Like a squad, a screw is attached to the arm
 dibiya ke bheetar dhansi pench kii pindi se ek samtal darpan laga rahata he
 This is called a directive mirror
 pench ghumaane se darpan or saath hi ankit chaap par bhujaa main laga burneer chalata he
 This allows the angular momentum of the mirror to be known
 is nirdash darpan ke saamne hi ek doosraa darpan rahata he jiskaa neeche kaa aadha bhaag paardarshee or upar kaa paravartak hota he
 One of the two points between which the angle has to be measured is seen from the transparent part of the horizon mirror with a telescope or hole made in the box and the reflection of the second point appears in the horizon mirror after one reflection from the reference mirror
 is samay pench se nirdesh darpan aise ghumaate hai ki kshitij darpan ke paardarshee bhaag se dekhe bindu kii kiran pratibimb kii kiran par sannipati ho jaae
 At this time, the angle between the two mirrors will be half of the angle formed by the two points at the position of the observer
 darpanon ke bich kaa kone burneer suchak ke saamne ankit chaap par padhaa ja saktaa he jisase binduon ke bich kaa kone gyaat ho sake
 a magnifying lens is placed on the Bernier indicator itself to take correct readings
 magar chaap par anshankan is prakaar kiya jaataa he ki binduon dwaara nirmit kone sidhaa padhaa ja sake
 To provide this facility, double the amount of speed of the mirror is written
 jaise 10° ke saamne 20°, 20° ke saamne 40°, isi prakaar antim anshankan 60° ke saamne 120° likhte hai
 The amount read from this will be the amount of the angle
 kone ek minute tak sahi pard sakate hai
 It is a 60 ° segment of metal whose arc is inscribed
 vakr ke centre se ek bhujaa chaap par faili hoti he
 Bernier and a tactile screw are attached to the tip of this arm
 isi bhujaa par upar nirdesh darpan laga rahata he
 The arm can rotate at the center, along with the direction mirror and Bernier on the arch
 chaap ko thame ek ardhavyas par nirdesh darpan ke saamne aadha paardarshee or aadha paravartak kshitij kaanch dridhtaa se laga hota he jisase hokar dekhne ke liye saamne doorabeen hoti he
 It is clear that its structure is similar to the box sextant and also the mode of observation
 surya ke prekshan ke liye rangeen kaanch rahata he
 The fraction and its small division are made up to 20 ¢ or 10 ¢ according to the size of the device at an arc of 60 °
 burneer se 202 yaa 102 tak padhane kii suvidha rahati he
 In order to obtain the correct reading from the sextant, the following geometric relationships must be made and, if not, these relationships are established by adjusting: suchakank or kshitij kaanch chaap ke samtal par lamb hon, When the Bernier index is zero, the director and the horizon mirror are parallel, and drushtirekha chaap ke samtal ke samaantar ho

 maanav ke saarvajanik or raajnneetik vyavhaar ko samajhane main is avadharana kaa athulaneey mahatv he
 Although these two are used as synonyms, they have specific meaning in political sociology
 prayek raajnneetik vyavastha main shakti keval kuch logon athwa alpsankhyak samooh main hi kendrit hoti he
 How does it happen? As a result of efforts to find the answer to these questions in political sociology, the principles related to elite have developed
 abhijaat siddhanth is tathy par aadhaarit hai ki prayek samaaj main mote taur par do bhinn varg paye jate hai- ek, thode yaa alpsankhyak logon kaa varg jo apni kshamta ke aadhaar par samaaj ko sarvocch netritv pradaan karata he tathaa shashan karata he, tathaa doosraa, jan-samooh yaa asankhya saadhaaranjanon kaa varg, jiske bhagya main shasit hona likhaa he
 The first class is called the elite class and the second one is called the mass group
 abhijan kii avadharana ko pehle keval raajnneetik drushti se hi dekha jaataa tha tathaa keval shaasha varg evam shaktishaalee abhijanon kii ore dhyaan diya jaataa tha, parantu aaj aisa nahin hai
 Today, among the elite, powerful elite class, capitalist class, military elite, ruling class, intellectual class, bureaucrats and managers are also included
 shakti ke asmaan vitaran ke atirikt saamaajik starikaran ke adhyayanon ne bhi abhijan siddhanton ke vikaas main mahatvapurn yogadan diya he
 Today, the theory of eligibility is considered a fundamental theory in political science, sociology and political sociology
 yah sanpratyay saamaajik-raajnneetik yatharth ko samajhane main kaaphi mahatvapurn he kyonki prayek samaaj main kisi na kisi prakaar kaa saamaajik, raajnneetik, aarthik sanstaran paaya jaataa he
 The term Abhijana was used in the seventeenth century to mean special and best things or qualities, in which sense the word Vajra was used for high level individuals such as crack soldier squads or aristocrats
 unnisvin shatabdi ke ant tak is shabd kaa prayog saamaajik evam raajnneetik lekhon main vyapak rup se nahin hua tha
 After the Second World War in the twentieth century, the concept of elite and its principles became very popular in Western countries and America and since then the concept of elite became widely used in social science
 abhijan siddhanton ke saath parato, moska, si0 rhite mills, edward shills, shumpiter, roberta michels, james bernaham, remand eran, karl mainhim, herold laswell ityadi vidwano ke naam jude hue hai
 Here, a brief discussion of the views of some prominent scholars will be appropriate
 wilfredo parato ne abhijan ko paribhaashit karte hue kaha he ki prayek vishisht maanviya kriya main agar ham vyaktiyon kii gatividhiyon ke kshetra ke suchakon ko ank de den to jo vyakti sarvocch ank praapt karte hai, unhen abhijan kaha jaataa he
 In other words, elites include all successful individuals who are supreme in every activity and at every level of society
 inke shabdon main jin vyaktiyon ko kisi vishisht maanviya gatividhi ke kshetra main sarvocch ank milen yadi unka ek varg banaaya jaay to us varg ko abhijan varg kaa naam de sakate hai
 Gitano Mosca is the first scholar to have used the words 'abhijana' and 'people' in a specific sense
 inke shabdon main, sabhi samaajon main un samaajon se lekar jinka abhi bahut kam vikaas hua he or jo abhi tak sabhyataa kii pehali kirnon kaa sansparsh bhi thik se nahin kar paye hai, un samaajon tak jo sabase adhik viksit evam shaktishaalee he, sabhi samaajon main keval do prakaar ke virgon ke log paye jate hai
 One, the people of that class who rule and the other, who are ruled, the people of the first class, despite being a minority, control all kinds of political work in their hands, all power is concentrated in their hands and power They get the benefit of the benefits of the second class, while the second class being the majority, the first class, sometimes in legitimate ways and sometimes in more or less amount of arbitrary And remains guided and controlled in violent ways
 moska ke anusaar sabhi prakaar ke shashan main niyantran sadaiv se sambhrant varg ke haath main hota he
 Also, there is some quality in the ruling class due to which it is considered to be respected and influential in the society, even if those qualities are real or merely remain as mere appearances
 herold di0 laswell ne raajnneetik abhijanon par vishesh dhyaan diya he
 In his words, political elite consists of the ruling body of the political body
 sattadhariyon main vah netritv tathaa saamaajik rachana bhi sammilit he jisamen netaaon kaa udbhav hota he tathaa jiske prati kisi nishchit avadhi tak ve uttaradaayi hote hai
 Raymond S
 has also considered the elite class like Lasswell as the ruling class, which is in small numbers
 inhone abhijan varg evam anya samaajik virgo ke bich sambandh sthapit karne kaa prayaas kiya he tathaa buddhijivi abhijanon ke saamaajik prabhaav kaa vivechan kiya he jo ki raajnneetik satta kii vyavastha kaa ang nahin hote
 TB Botomore has disagreed with the views of the above scholars on the ground that they have not paid any attention to the ideology contained in the doctrine of eligibility
 botomor ke anusaar abhijan kii avadharana prajatantr ke mahatv ke virodh main viksit hui he
 According to him, the term 'abhijana' is generally being used in fact for functional, mainly business groups, which have a high status in society
 inke vichaaron main adhik naveen kaal ke samajashastriyon ne abhijan shabd kaa prayog adhik chote va adhik sangathit samoohon ke liye kiya he jo kam athwa adhik rup se parsparik rup se sayukt saamaajik virgon se sambandhit ho sakate hai
 In Batomore's view, Raymond Aron is the only scholar who has studied relations among the elite and has tried to explain that the elimination of classes will not solve the problem of social stratification, creation of elite and inequalities of political power
 duusare shabdon main abhijanon kaa astitv prayek prakaar ke samaaj evam raajnneetik vyavastha main bana rahegaa
 It is clear from the above discussion that there is no one common definition of eligibility and that the elites generally include those people who are socially, economically and politically higher than other people, ie the general public
 It is known that there are different types of elite such as ruling class, powerful elite, intellectual class, Rbndhk, bureaucrats and military officers and so on

 maharishi garg ne vedikakaal main do swatantra nakshatra gananaaon kaa ullekh kiya he- ek krittikadi or duusari dhanishthadi
 Garga sentence is that - Tesham sarveshan nakshatranam karmasu kritika prathamacchakshte shravishtu numeya: Poorva lagnanam means that in all nakshatras, krittika is said to be the first among the deeds of fire etc
 rahasy yah he ki jis samay krittika kaa tarapunj vishavadvrutt main tha us samay krittikadi nakshatra gananaa kaa aarambh hua
 When Uttarayana started on Dhanishthana, Dhanishtani calculation began
 taittiriya brahman main likhaa he ki mukhan vaa etannakshana yatkruttika etaah vai praachai disho na chyavante arthath krittika sab nakshatron main pratham he
 It does not move away from the east direction in the Uday period
 yah nishchay he ki jo grah yaa nakshatra vishuvadvrutt main hota he usee kaa udai purv bindu main prithvi tal par sarvatra hota he
 When calculated according to the celestial position of the rod, this time proves to be about 5100 years ago
 at: hamaare faladesh kii grahadasha paddati itani pracheen to he hi
 The condition of our horoscope, influenced by the sequence of inferences, the Arab countrymen started a new system of the year, called 'tajik'
 isamen praani ke janm kaal se saura varsh kii purti ke samay kaa lagn laakar ek varsh ke andar honevaale shubhashubhon kaa vichaar kiya jaataa he
 It has a predominance of 16 yogas in which profit, loss and physical condition are considered
 in 16 yogon ke naam arabi bhashaa ke hi hai sanskrit granthon main unke naam uccharan ke anusaar kuch parivartit ho gaye he yatha, iqbaal asharaf, ittsaal aadi
 At present, the system of the birth chart of the horoscope by doing twelve parts of the zodiac is not mentioned in the ancient Vedic literature of India
 kintu atharv jyotish main bahut pehle se hi is paddati ke mul tatv nihit hai
 In this, nine parts of the 27 constellations of the zodiac are considered as one part of each of the three constellations
 inamen pratham 'janm nakshatra', dasavaan 'karm nakshatra' tathaa unnisvan 'aadhaan nakshatra' mana gaya he
 The rest is considered to be Sampat, Vipat, Kshemya, Pratvar, Sadhak, Naidhan, Maitra and Param Maitra in the order, such as- inamen janm, sampat or naidhan arthath 1, 2 or 7, dwadash bhavvaali janmkundali ke 1, 2 or 8 sthanon se milte hai
 Atharva is the tenth Karma constellation in astrology
 aadhunik paddati main bhi dasham sthaan karm he
 This proves that the nine places in Atharva astrology are interwoven into some of the twelve places of the present horoscope, which existed in our method of preaching before the introduction of nouns like Aries
 purv kshitij main laganevaale nakshatron ko lagn nakshatra maanane kaa varnan 3300 varsh pracheen vedang jyotish main bhi he
 Such as - Sravishtabhyo Gunabhyastan Pragvilagnan Specificand
 arthath gun teen kii gananaa kar ghanishta se purv kshitij main lage nakshatron ko bataanaa chahie
 From this it becomes clear that at that time the nine parts of the Nakshatra Chakra were done by dividing three into 27 Nakshatras
 atharv jyotish ke nav vibhaagon kaa saamanjasy isse ho jaataa he
 European scholars believe that twelve parts or twelve zodiac signs of the constellation cycle came from outside India
 kintu hamaare vaidic sahitya main surya kii gati ke aadhaar par nakshatra chakra ke baarah bhaag or chandramaa kii dainik gati ke aadhaar par 27 bhaag pehle se kiye gaye hai
 Although the stories related to the constellations and the moon are in our Puranas, there are no stories of the Meshadi zodiacs but in the Greek literature
 phir bhi itane se hi siddh nahin hota ki rashigananaa or bhav bharat main baahar se aae
 The statements of European scholars are giving evidence to the contrary
 jaikobi kaa kathan he ki janmkundali main dwadash grihon se fal bataane kii paddati formikas matternas ke granth main milti he
 It is also known here that no Jataka texts are known in Greece even before Ptolemy
 tolemi ke do jataka granth almijasti or titrabiblas kahe jate hai kintu yah pramanit nahin he
 It is not possible to have 6 Aryan writers and five Arasha writers in the pre-250 years of Varahamihira, if the preaching of the book of Parmicus Maternus was accepted as true in India after 354 AD
 varahamihir ne apane purvavarti may yavan, manittth, satya, vishnugupt aadi aacharyon kaa naam liya he
 Bhattottapal, the commentator of Brihajatak, holds that he is Acharya Chanakya, the minister of Vishnugupta Moon
 is prakaar yah hamaari rashigananaa paddati isvi san se 300 varsh purv kii siddh hoti he
 This does not make the statement that the census came from outside India
 brihatsamhita ke grahacharadhyay main grahagochar fal die hai
 Chandra is the first place in it
 us adhyay main 'mandavy' kaa ullekh he
 Mandavya is a great writer
 mandavy ke granth main chandrakundali mukhya thi athwa usamen chandramaa ke sthaan se vichaar kiya gaya tha
 This idea was from 9 places of Atharva Jyatish
 10 raashiyon ke prachaar main aane ke baad iskaa vichaar 12 bhaavon se hone laga
 Therefore, it is only reasonable to assume that the method of horoscope was practiced by a sage like Garga etc
 kyonki isvi san se 500 varsh purv vidyaman vishisht siddhant main bhi lagn or bhaavon kii kalpana he
 Some zodiac signs and Greek names in Indian astrology are proof that we had ancient contact with the Greeks
 unase anek vidyaon or kalaon kaa aadan-pradaan bhi hua
 Varahamihira has written that- isse yah nishkarsh nahin nikaalnaa chahie ki hamaara sara kaa sara jatakashastra udhaar liya gaya he
 Knowing the method of Indian horoscope, the Greeks expanded it and presented it in a new form to the Indians in the time of Varahamihira
 falat: varahamihir ne unki hora, dreshkan aadi naveen paddatiyon ke saath raashiyon ke naam bhi unani hi rakh liye, jaise aaj hamaara bijganit arabon dwaara europe main failaayaa jaakar apane bahad rup main pun: bharat lautakar naveen ganit ke naam se vikhyath hua he
 Just as there are twelve zodiac signs in the sky, in the present time there are twelve expressions in the horoscope
 janm kundali yaa janmang chakra main kisi ke janm samay main akaash kii us janm sthaan par kya sthiti thi, iskaa akashi naksh he
 The chart of the twelve mines is made in Janmang

 In addition to the internal cubes, there is only one kidney and one gill
 praavarguha evam gudadvar agrabhag main rahete hai
 Experts are of the opinion that the reason for this asymmetric composition of the udiparas is only the development of a shell that is in one piece and can cover all the components of the body and even the fleshy legs and protect them
 aisa khol kuntalavalayit ho hi saktaa he
 For this to be formed, it was necessary that the cavity cavity, gills and excreta pores all come to the opening of the shell near the head of the animal
 yah tabhi ho saktaa he jab praavarguha or uske bheetar ke sab avyav apana purana pichhebala sthaan chhodkar aage aa jaaen, or udrapadon ke vikaas main aisa hua bhi he
 This causes one side of the animal to grow, and the other side stops

 But each element remains single
 khol chota ho jaataa yaa purnataya lupt ho jaataa he
 In pulmonata, there is a slight difference in this action - the shell remains and the pleural-inner-loop becomes smaller

 Due to the influence of the means of communication, the impact of this fast spread throughout India and in support of it people started taking to the streets
 inhone bharat sarkaar se ek majboot bhrashtachar virdohi lokapal vidheyak banane kii maang kii thi or apni maang ke anuroop sarkaar ko lokapal bill kaa ek masauda bhi diya tha
 But the then government led by Manmohan Singh showed negative attitude towards it and ignored it
 iske parinamswaroop shuru hue anshan ke prati bhi unka ravaiya upeksha purna hi rahaa
 But taking the form of the agitation for this fast, the Government of India hastily avoided the potential danger by forming a committee and accepted the passage of Lokpal Bill in Parliament by 16 August
 agast se shuru hue monsoon satr main sarkaar ne jo vidheyak prastut kiya vah kamjor or jan lokapal ke sarvatha vipareet tha
 Anna Hazare reiterated that he would go on hunger strike from August 16 against his earlier declared date
 sarkaar ne isaki raah main kai rode atkaaye evam 16 agast ko anna hajaare evam unke saathiyon ko giraftaar kar liya
 But this led to agitation in the entire country
 desh bhar main agle 12 dilon tak lagaataar badi sankhya main dharna, pradarshan or anshan yojit kiye gaye
 Finally, on August 28, Anna announced the postponement of his fast after the Parliament passed the proposal of concurrence on three terms of Anna
 5 april 2011 ko ek shashakt lokapal vidheyak ke nirmaan kii maang par sarkari niskriyata ke pratirodh main anna hajaare ne aamaran anshan shuru kar diya
 Arvind Kejriwal, Kiran Bedi, Prashant Bhushan, Baba Ramdev and many other famous social workers were involved in this campaign against corruption
 sarkaar ne ise upekshit karnaa jari rakhaa
 This fast began to be published and circulated widely in the media of India and soon
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jari is koshish ko sheeghra hi vyapak jansamarthan milane laga
 In almost all the cities of India, the youth took to the streets and demonstrated in support of it and distributed pamphlets
 anna hajaare ke anshan ke deshvyapee jan aandolan ke rup main fail jane se chintit sarkaar ne janalokapal vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar karne ke liye jhatpat ek samiti kii ghoshnaa kii
 It also agreed to pass a strong Lokpal Bill in Parliament before 16 August
 is tarah yah anshan samaapt hua or bhrashtachar ke viruddh panapata jan andolan majboot lokapal ke nirmaan kii aashaa ke saath samaapt hua
 But the government's intent was doubtful, so Anna Hazare also announced that if the expected Lokpal Bill is not produced by the next 15 August, then he will go on a fast from 16 August
 april main kiye gaye anna hajaare ke anshan kii samaapti kii sharton ke anuroop sarkaar ne 10 sadasyeey lokapal masauda nirmaan samiti ke nirmaan kii ghoshnaa kii
 5 representatives of the government and 5 representatives of civil society were placed in it
 anna hajaare ne sarkaar ke sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon kii baadhyataa vaale tark kaa virodh na karte hue kisi mantri ko samiti kaa adhyaksh hona sweekaar kar liya
 But the ministers of this committee headed by Kapil Sibal did their own arbitrariness
 pradhanmantri or nyaayadhishon ko lokapal ke daayre main laane ke mudde par naagarik samaaj ke pratinidhiyon or sarkaar ke bich virodh bana rahaa
 Kapil Sibal said that civil society opinion will not be taken to make law in future
 antat mantriyon ne anna hajaare dwaara prastut jan lokapal ke sabhi mahatvapurn sujhaavon ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 All the points of the Jan Lokpal were accepted for showing, which kept the government ministers and mps, and the judges out of the reach of the Lokpal
 antat sarkari mantriyon ke ravaiye se niraash anna hajaare ke saathiyon ne jan lokapal kaa masauda alag se nirmit kiya
 And thus the committee produced two drafts which were placed before the Union Cabinet
 vahaan bhi mantriyon ke masaude ko to purnatah prastut kiya gaya kintu jan lokapal kaa saransh rakhaa gaya
 And as expected, the cabinet adopted the draft ministers and agreed to present it in Parliament
 4 agast 2011 ko sansad main lokapal vidheyak prastut kiya gaya
 The Prime Minister was kept out of its purview during his tenure in the government's Lokpal Bill
 lekin sabhi bhootpurv pradhanmantri iske daayre main rakhe gaye the
 Accordingly, the Lokpal will be a committee headed by a current or retired judge

 Several days before August 15, it had become clear that there would be a hunger strike announced from August 16
 sarkaar ne ise rokane kii har tarah kii koshish aarambh kar di
 Delhi Police refused permission to fast on Jantar Mantar till 1 August
 iske pashchaat anna hajaare ne chaar anya sthaan sujhakar vahaan anshan karne kii anumati maangi kintu vah bhi nahin di gai
 Finally, on August 13, Anna Hazare announced that if he was not allowed to go on a hunger strike, he would start the Jail Bharo movement
 saath hi unhone pani bhi tyaag dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 Delhi Police granted permission to fast in JP Park with 22 restrictions

 log baapu kaa priyabhajan raghupati raghav raja ram gaayen or saansadon se puuchhen ki lokapal par unki raay kya he
 He is with the government ombudsman or with the Jan Lokpal
 kyonki aap logon ne unhen vot diya he
 it's your right
 arvind kejariwal ne jaananaa chaha ki pradhanmantri bataaen ki sarkaar se kis jagah or kahaan baat kerani he
 He added further to Anna's talk that besides the mps, people should also go outside the houses of ministers and mlas in Delhi and picket and ask those people what their opinion is

 sarkari vaartakaron ne iske liye agle din subah tak kaa samay liya
 Dr
 Naresh Trehan had advised Anna Hazare to drip after checking the health of Anna Hazare on the evening of Tuesday 23 August but he also refused
 raat ko logon ko sambodhit karte hue anna ne kaha ki dopaher ke baad doctoron ne kaha tha ki kidney main kuch samasya aa gai he or unhen drip ke zarie dawa deni hogi
 i told the doctors that i would listen to my conscience and tell what i would do
 meri antaratma kah rahi he ki tu ye kya kah rahaa he ki dil diya he, jaan bhi denge or jaan dene se darataa he
 

 So i have told the doctors that my conscience is saying that no medicine is to be taken
 mai mar gaya to parvaah nahin, mere baad kitne anna khadey ho gaye hai
 If something happens to their kidneys, then one of the thousands of people will give them the kidney
 doctor kii report ke baad sarkaar bhi kuch sochane lagegi or agar sarkaar kii ore se unhen jabardastee uthaakar le jane ke prayaas honto saare darwaazon par log khadey ho jaaen or mujhe le jane na dena
 "the government's position changed overnight and on 24 August it withdrew from the consensus reached yesterday
 usne jan lokapal vidheyak ko sansad main prastut karne se inkaar kar diya or anna ke anshan ko unki samasya bataaya
 The possibility of forcibly lifting Anna from the hunger strike also increased
 24 agast buudhvaar kii shaam ko samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue anna hazaare ne kaha- "do not commit violence 


 i will not tolerate violence
 agar main jail jaaun to aap log saansadon ke ghar par virodh jataao
 Do not do any harm to national property
 agar police aati he to main kushi se jail jaaoongaa
 or kal se sabko jail baro andolan karnaa he
 The country has to be saved from the path of non-violence
 ye azaadiki duusari ladaai he
 The government's attitude is not dictatorial, but dictatorship
 ye lokshahi ke liye bahut bada khatara he lekin meri vinati he ki agar sarkaar mujhe yahaan seuthae to use koi roke nahin
 Now i have understood the tricks of the government
 sarkaar chaahati he ki andolan ko todane ke liye aap log hinsa karen
 So we all have to be restrained
 "25 agast ko anshan ke 10wein din ramlila maidan main anna hajaare ne kaha ki "meraa vajan sirf 6
5 kilogram kam hua he
 The rest is fine
 mujhe aisa lag rahaa he ki main jan lokapal vidheyak paarit hone tak nahin maruunga
 i am getting a lot of energy from you
 " Demonstrations across the country continued for the tenth consecutive day in support of Anna Hazare
 lagaataar duusare din logon ne pradhanmantri awaas ke baahar pradarshan kiya
 50 of them were taken into custody
 ahimsaatmak pradarshnon se ghabaraai sarkaar kii suraksha ke naam par par dilli police ne pradhanmantri awaas ke najadik ke chaar metro steshnon- huda city centre or jahangirpuri ke bich sthit udyog bhawan, res course or jor baag tathaa kendriya sachivalay se badarpur maarg par khan market metro stesan ko dopaher teen baje se band karvaa diya
 In an interaction with Anna Hazare's representatives and the government, the Prime Minister said while trying to calm the deadlock that arose on August 24, the government is ready to discuss the bill and government bill of Aruna Rai including Jan Lokpal in the House
 bhrashtachar ke masale par loksabhaa main charchaa kii gai
 The Lok Sabha, including the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, unanimously appealed to Anna Hazare to end his fast
 iske baad kendriya vigyaan evam praudyogikimantri vilasarav deshmukh ne ramlila maidan jaakar anna hajaare ko sabhi partiyon tathaa sansad kii ore se bheja gaya patr diya or unase anshan samaapt karne kaa aagrah kiya
 On the proposal of getting the Jan Lokpal including Aruna Rai's Bill and the Government Bill discussed in the House, Anna said that "if the discussion on the Jan Lokpal Bill starts in Parliament, we will consider breaking our fast
" lekin hamaari teen mukhya maange hai
 Appointment of Lokayukta in states, bringing lower level officers also under the purview of Lokpal and make a citizen charter
 yah teenon garibon ke liye hai
 Their fast will continue until there is a consensus between the ruling party and the opposition on these issues
 pradhanmantri or puri sansad dwaara apane swasthya par chintaa jataae jane par apni pratikriya dete hue anna hajaare ne kaha ki "iske liye ham unhen dhanyavad dete hai
 But he was worried about my health today
 anna ke swasthya kii chintaa he unhen to vah 10 dinon se kahaan the
 Actually, the concern is those who have come here
 air condishan main baithne waalon ko anna ke swasthya kii chintaa nahin he
 "anna wrote to the Prime Minister in a letter to Vilasrao that-" We have great respect for our Parliament, our Parliament is the holy temple of our democracy
 " main anshan par apane kisi swaarth ke liye nahin baitha, jis tarah se aap log desh kii bhalaai ke liye kaam kar rahe hai usee tarah se main bhi desh ke logon ke bare main hi sochataa rahata hoon
 i have no power of any kind
 main ek bahut saamaanya aadmi hoon or samaaj va garib janata ke liye kuch karne kii bhaavana rakhata hoon
 Our movement is not against any person or party
 ham bhrashtachar ke kilaaf hai
 We want to change the corrupt system
 yadi hamaare andolan ke dauraan mere athwa mere kisi saathi ke dwaara kuch aise shabd kahe gaye kiye gaye hon jisase aapako yaa kisi anya vyakti ko chot pahaunchi ho to main ham sabaki taraf se dilgir vyakt karata hoon
 It is not our goal to hurt anyone
 har rajya main isi kaanoon ke zarie lokayukta bhi banaae jaaen, har vibhaag main jan samasyaon ke liye citizans charter banaae jaae jise na maanane par sambandhit adhikari par karrwai ho or teesraa ye ki centre sarkaar ke upar se neeche tak sabhi karmchaariyon or rajya ke sabhi karmchaariyon ko iske daayre main laayaa jaae
 Can a motion be brought to Parliament on these three things? i have no hope that all our mps will be ready at the beginning to rid the people of the country of corruption every day
 My conscience says that if these things are agreed in Parliament, then i should break my fast
 " The rest of the Jan Lokpal bill, such as the selection process, is also very important to prevent corruption
 main meri janata ke saath tab tak ramlila maidan main baitha rahoonga jab tak baaqi saare muddon par sansad main nirnay nahin ho jaataa kyonki yahi janata kii awaz he
 So many people have joined me all over the country in the hope that they will get rid of corruption
 iske liye jaruri he ki rajyon main bhi lokayukta ke gathan ke liye kanoon paas ho
 There should be a system to fight against the corruption of the officials, who have to face two-four daily corruption
 isi tarah sabhi sarkari sevaaon ke liye samaysima tay ho or unhen samay par puraa nahin karne vaale adhikari par jurmaana lage
 This letter of Anna was also discussed at the Anna Hazare Prime Minister's residence, but the attitude of the government remained the same the next day
 
 With this, the government had prepared a section of media through advertisements and other means which was now trying to justify their favor
 kai sanchaar madhyam anna team ke bich foot, pradarshkon ke bich lokapal kii kam samajhadaari aadi vishay uthaane lage the
 Despite this the movement was continuing and the government was under increasing pressure
