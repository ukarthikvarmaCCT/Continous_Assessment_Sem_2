 ham main se baaki ke liye, yah spasht ho gaya he ki hamen kya karne kii jarurat he
 We recently wrote a song with Jimmy

 He used to talk to me about songs every night and tell me 'this nonsense will change the world'
 i agreed with him, unfortunately i did not know that this would happen on these conditions
 Please be patient with us because we cannot imagine how hard it is for us to overcome, we only know that we have to do it for His will

In a recent interview by an independent Huntington Beach newspaper, Jimmy Sullivan's parents, Barbara and Joseph, gave the following information about Avenged Sevenfold's new album: "it was very important to him, Jimmy's Avenged Sevenfold's new album 'S songs were written recently - one he called his' masterpiece'
 jab vah geet likhata tha, vah apni awaz main piano or drum bajaate hue geet record karata tha-uske baad, jab vah mere liye unhen bajaata tha, to vah orcestra yaa guitar ke un bhaagon ko ga kar sunaata tha jinhen baad main joda janaa tha
 i am thankful to tell him how much i like his music and am a fan of it
 Later, Barbara comments that, "jimmy wrote some really good songs
 mujhe us par garv tha or mujhe pataa tha ki haalanki unke liye yah bahut hi mushkil ho jayega, kintu band unhen jald hi record karne ke liye acha kaam karegaa
 yah kehane kii aavashyaktaa nahin he ki mere liye jimi ke geeton ko abhi bhi sunanaa lagbhag asambhav he, lekin inhen sunanaa ek aashirwad ke samaan he

 17 farvari 2010 ko, avenced sevenfold ne kaha ki unhonen dream theatre ke drumer mike portnoy ke saath studio main pravesh kiya tha, jo geet main drum bajaane ke liye da rev ke sthaan par he
 "I want to tell my fans that with Jimmy in our hearts, our recording journey has officially begun

 hamane jimi ke pasandida drumer mike portnoy ko uske sthaan par record karne ke liye poocha
 mike ne kaha ki yah ek sammaan kii baat he or isamen koi andeh nahin he ki gym kii bhi yahi ichha thi
 It is comforting to us that someone like Mike, who is undoubtedly reputed to be the best drummer in the world, has maintained respect and reverence for The Rave's abilities
 haalanki hamaare bhai ke bina yah kabhi bhi us jaisaa nahin hoga, uskaa saar hamaare dil main sangeet ke madhyam se rahata he jise banane main usne madad kii
 vah kisi bhi safalataa yaa asafalataa se pehle ek mahaan charitra tha or ham ise apane prashansakon ko saupate hue or vishesh taur par jimi ke liye, atyadhik utsahit hai
 " band nae album ke daure ke liye taiyaari kar rahaa he
 M
 Shedos has said, "we are not sure what is going to happen after the completion of this tour
 abhi hamaara lakshya sirf bacchon ko record sunaanaa he, kyonki ham chaahate hai ki ve da rev ko yaad rakhen

 apane pehle saptaah main billboard 200 par pratham sthaan par rahete hue 163000 pratiyon kii bikri ke saath nikhmer ne bikri ke anumaanon ko aasaani se tod diya
 Avenged Sevenfold's material has many styles and has evolved over the band's ten-year career
 prarambh main, band kii pehali album sounding da seventh trumpet main puri tarah se lagbhag metalcore dhwani shaamil thi; haalanki is style main kai vividhtaayen thim, vishesh rup se "streats" main jisame pank style ko apanaaya gaya he tathaa "varmness on da sol" jo ek piano aadhaarit geet he
 In Waking the Fallen, the band once again performed the contemporary metalcore style, but incorporated more explicit and more mature vocals and complex musical elements
 band kii ol acces dividi main, nirmaataa andrew madrock ne is parivartan kaa varnan kiya: "jab sounding da seventh trumpet ke baad or weking da falen ke aane se pehle main band se mila, em
shados ne mujhase kaha "yah record chillaahat bharaa he
 The record we want to make must be half screaming and half singing
 i don't wanna scream anymore And the record after that is just about singing
 '" In Avenged Sevenfold's third album, City of the Evil, the band decided to abandon the metalcore genre and further develop the hard rock genre
 avenced sevenfold kii swa-sheershak album main, ek baar phir, album kii mukhya hard rock tathaa haivi metal kii bajaae kai sheliyaan or andaaz hai, vishesh rup se "dear god" main, jisame country style apanaai gai he tathaa e little pis of haven", jo broadway sho dhunon se prabhavit he tathaa jisame lead or ridam guitar ke sthaan par mukhya rup se brass upkarnon or string orcestra kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 The band has undergone substantial changes since their debut album, during which they were defined as a heavy band with loud riffs and noisy guitars, with a loud sound of screaming and howling
 The band can be expected
 band ne duusare band jaise bed riligian, gans en' rojez, aayran madan, pantera, dream theatre, metelika, enoefex, elice in chens, blike flag, corozan of conformity, da missfits, slair, da vandles, rej against da mashin, corn, deftons or eeffai ke kalatmak prabhaavon kaa bhi anukaran kiya he
 The band's name is taken from the Bible's Book of Genesis — specifically Genesis 4:24, in which Kane is sentenced to an exiled life sentence for the murder of his brother
 ishwar use chinhit kar detaa he taaki uske paapon ke liye use koi na maare, jo vyakti ken ko maarane kaa saahas karegaa, use "saat baar pratishodh se peedit hona hoga"
 unke band ke sankshipt naam "A7X" kaa suzav guitaravadak jaiki venjiens ne diya tha
 The title of Avenged Sevenfold's song "chapter Four" refers to the fourth chapter of Genesis in which the story of Kane and Abel begins
 geet kaa vishay bhi is kahani se judaa hua prathit hota he
 "beast and the Harlot", another song taken from the Bible, quoted from the Book of Revelation, is written only in person and refers to Babylon the Great, the world's empire and artificial religions
 "da viked and" main ek or bible sandarbh aata he
 In this song, many times it is said "clear the dust from the apple, enjoy each cleft and in your deepest heart you will know that Adam was alright
" " jo eve dwaara manaa kiye gaye fal ko khaane kii ore ishaara karata he
 Although the band's title and members' stage names are related to religion, Shadows stated in an interview that they are not a religious band
 unhone kaha, "jo bhi hamaare geet padhata he or hamaare bare main vastav main kuch jaanata he, unhen pataa hoga ki ham koi prachaar nahin kar rahe hai"
 "is band kii ek khaas baat jo mujhe pasand he, yah he ki ham logon par kabhi bhi kisi prakaar ke, jaise rajnatik yaa dharmik vishwaas nahin thopate
 ham bas, sangeet se manoranjan karne ke liye hai or shaayad donon taraf vichaaron ko jaagrit karne ke liye, lekin ham kabhi bhi vastav main kisi kaa galaa kaatane kii koshish nahin karte
 mujhe lagata he ki aajkal bahut se band aisa kar rahe hai
 "some of the band's songs are of a political type, such as" Critical Acclaim "," Gunslinger "and" Blinded in Chains "
 The song" Bitred "from their album City of Evil," Dimebag wrote about Darrell's death " i went
 band "dethbat" ke rup main pahachaane jane vaale logo kaa samarthan karata he
 It was originally designed by Avenged Sevenfold's high school friend, Mikah Montague, as seen on the band's first DVD All Access
 "dethbat" band ke sabhi albamon ke cover par dikhaai diya he, jinamein se kai ko band ke ek kareebi dost camerun recom, dwaara banaaya gaya tha
 Deathbats evolved from bats' wings on only one skull, sometimes appearing with bat wings on a full "human-shaped" skull, as can be seen on the cover of the City of Evil album
 sounding da seventh trumpet main do logon kii tasviren hai, ek anya devdoot jaisaa manushya or uske neeche ek ardh-apaardarshak dethbat, album ke pichley cover par bhi kai dethbat pradarshit hai
 deathbat is also featured on the covers of several solo songs, such as "bat Country", Warmness on the Soul "and" Critical Acclaim "

 John Francis "jack" Welsh, Jr
 is an American businessman and writer
 1981 se 2001 ke bich vah general electric ke adhyaksh or siio rahe
 welsh kii kul anumaanit sampatti 720 million dollar he
 Jack Welsh was born in Salem, Massachusetts
 unke pita jon, boston or main railroad conductor jabaki maa gres gruhinee thim
 Welsh received his schooling from Salem High School
 He later studied at Massachusetts Amherst University and graduated in science in 1957 with a degree in chemical engineering
 misacusets uniwarsity main adhyayan ke dauraan ve fee sigma kappa samooh kii alpha shakha ke sadsy the
 Welsh received his MS in 1960 from the University of Illinois at arabana-champaign
 And ph
d
 Degree obtained welsh ne 1960 main general electric main naukari karnaa shuru kiya
 He started as a junior engineer in Pittsfield, Massachusetts at an annual salary of $ 10,500
 jab ve jeei main the, to ek baar unhone factory kii chat ko hi visphot se uda diya, unki is harakat ke liye unhen naukari se lagbhag nikaal hi diya gaya tha
 Welsh was unhappy with the $ 1,000 salary increase a year after his job and ge's strict bureaucracy
 unhone company chhodane or ilinois ke scoki main international minerals & chemicals main kaam karne kaa nishchay kiya
 Reuben Gutoff, a young officer working two positions above Welsh in the company, understood that Welsh could prove to be a very important resource for the company, so it was not fair to lose them at any cost
 ve welsh or unki pehali patni carolin ko pitsfield ke yelo aster main dinar ke liye le gaye or chaar ghante tak welsh ko company na chhodane ke liye manaate rahe
 gatof ne vaayada kiya ki ve company kii maujuuda naukarshahi ko badal denge or ek choti company jaisaa khulaa maahaul banane kaa puraa prayaas karenge
 Gutoff remembers begging Welsh to say, "trust me
" "as long as i am here, you will get a chance to work in the best environment of a big company and whatever its drawbacks will be removed
" "thik he, par aap ise aazamaaishi samay maniega
 " welsh kaa jawaab tha
 "I enjoy this trial too," said Gutoff
 It is important to try to stop you here
 " In the morning, Welsh gave him his answer
 Gutoff recalls, "it was a good opportunity in my life from a marketing job
 " "lekin phir unhone mujhase kaha--or pehle jaik kaa yahi andaaz hua karata tha--main ab bhi party karuunga kyonki mujhe partiyaan pasand hai or iske alaava, mujhe lagata he ki unke paas mere liye kuch chote tohfe hai
 "nearly 12 years later, Welsh boldly wrote in his annual performance review report that his long-term goal was to become the company's CEO
 1972 main welsh ko jeei kaa upasabhapati namit kiya gaya
 He continued to grow and in 1977 he became the senior vice-president of the company and vice-president in 1979
 welsh 1981 main jeei ke sabase yuva adhyaksh or siio bane, unhone reginald ech
 jones kaa sthaan liya
 By 1982, Welsh had largely dismantled the management framework devised by the zones
 1980 ke dashak main, welsh ne jeei kii karypranali ko sarlikrut karne kii disha main kaary kiya
 In 1981, he delivered a speech in New York City on the title "moving at a fast pace in a slow growing economy"
 It is often called the "morning" of knowing the value of shareholder value
 baad main, 2008–2009 ke vaishvik aarthik sankat par financial times ko die ek saakshaatkaar main welsh ne kaha, "shairdharak kaa mulya duniya kaa sabase moorkhtapurna vichaar he
 Shareholder value is the result, not the strategy


 Your core is your employees, customers and your products
 " He also pressured managers to be more productive in their own business
 Welsh attempted to remove the inefficiency of the company by cutting inventories and dissolving the bureaucracy that had previously led to his leaving GE
 unhone kaarkaanon ko band kar diya, karmchaariyon kaa vetan kam kar diya or un puraani ikaayiyon ko band kar diya jo ab prabhaavaheen ho chuki thim
 Welsch believed that any company, whichever part of the industry it was, should be ranked # 1 or # 2 in it, or should leave the sector altogether
 Welsh's strategy was later adopted by ceos of several corporate companies across America
 har saal, welsh sabase bura pradarshan karne vaale apane 10% prabandhakon ko naukari se nikaal dete the
 In meetings with his employees, he became known for his candidness to the extent of being ruthless
 They pressurized their managers to perform well, but also provided bonuses and share options to the best performing 20% employees
 unhone jeei main share vikalp kaaryakramon kaa vistaar bhi keval sheersh adhikariyon kii bajaay company ke kareeb ek-tihaai karmchaariyon tak kiya
 Welsh is also known for ending the company's nine-level management hierarchy and creating an atmosphere of informality in the company
 1980 ke dashak ke shuruaati varshon main unhen imaaraton ko vaisaa hi chhodane lekin karmchaariyon ko naukari se nikaal dene ke liye "neutron jaik" ke naam se pukaara jane laga
 jaik:street from da gat main welsh kehete hai ki 1980 ke ant main jeei main 411,000 karmchaaree the jabaki 1985 ke ant tak ve 299,000 rah gaye
 Of the 112,000 employees out of the payroll, 37,000 remain in sales trades while 81,000 remain in current trade
 In return, GE increased its market capital significantly
 1986 main, jeei ne NBC kaa adhigrahan kar liya joki rockfilor centre main sthit thi; natijatan welsh ne 30 rockfilor plaza main jeei building main apana daftar bana liya
 During the 1990s, Welsh acquired several companies and transformed GE from a manufacturing to financial services company
 1995 ke antim maheenon main, welsh ne motorola ke sicks sigma quality program ko apana liya
 In 1980, a year before Welsch became CEO, GE had a turnover of about $ 26
8 billion
 2000 main, unke company chhodane ke ek varsh pehle company kaa kaarobaar badhkar kareeb 130 billian dollar ho gaya
 When Jack Welsh left GE, the company's market value had increased from $ 14 billion to $ 410 billion by the end of 2004, thus becoming the world's most expensive and largest company
 sevanivritti ke samay, welsh ko 4 million dollar vaarshik vetan miltaa tha, jiske baad unhen apni vivaadaaspad yojana ke mutabik 8 million dollar vaarshik dhan mila
 1999 main fortune magazine ne unhen "sadi kaa prabandhak" namit kiya
 Prior to Welsh's retirement, a long war of succession between James mcnerney, Robert Nardelli and Jeffery Immelt is well known
 aakhir, imelt ko company ke adhyaksh or siio ke rup main chunaa gaya
 Nardelli was the CEO of Home Depot until he resigned in the early months of 2007 and was Chrysler's CEO for some time, while mcnerney was then CEO of 3M until he assumed the same position at Boeing
 kuch udyog vishleshkon kaa daawa he ki welsh ko jeei kii safalataa kaa bahut zyada shrey diya jaataa he
 They claim that various managers have been primarily responsible for the success of the company
 udhaaharan ke liye, gairi si vandit ke adheen jeei capital ne company kii kul kamai main kareeb 40% yogadan diya jabaki NBC or robert si rhite ne network vistaar kaa mahatvapurn kaary kiya, jisase paanch saal tak company kii kamai main do-ankon kii badhat hoti rahi
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki welsh ne jeei ko kisi bade nuksaan se nahin bachaaya kyonki unke purvavarti adhikari, reginald ech
 jones ke kaarykaal ke dauraan company kii vaarshik kamai main vrudvi 16% thi
 Critics also say that the pressure exerted by Welsh does not keep many employees loyal to the company, possibly leading to some defense-deal scandals that hurt GE, or perhaps in the early 1990s
 Kidder, Peabody & Company bond-trading scheme came into existence due to which fake profit case was raised
 welsh ko unke madhyam varg or naukareepesha varg ke prati samvedanheen hone ke kaaran kai varshon tak teevr aalochana jhelni padi he
 Velsha has stated publicly that he does not mind the big difference in salaries of ceos with high salaries and employees with average salaries
 jab siio ko milane vaale atyadhik ucch vetan ke bare main unki raay poochi gai to welsh ne kaha ki aise sabhi aarope "apmanjanak" hai or unhone karmchaariyon kii kshatipurti ko prabhavit karne vaale prastaavit SEC niyamon kaa kadaa virodh kiya
 Responding to the uproar over the officers' excessive salaries, he said that compensation to the CEO should continue to be controlled by the free market, with no interference from the government or other external agencies
 Additionally, Welsh is a vocal opponent of the 2002 sarbanes-oxley Act
 welsh bachapan se hi thodaa haklaate the
 He had four children with his first wife Caroline
 They divorced with mutual consent in April 1987 after 28 years of marriage
 unki duusari patni, jine bisle, vilay-or-adhigrahan se jude maamalon kii vakil rahi thim
 He was married to Jack in April 1989 and divorced in 2003
 haalanki welsh ne vivaah-purv samjhauta kiya tha, lekin bisle ne use lagu karne ke liye das-varsh kii samay-seemaa par jor diya or is prakaar mana jaataa he ki shaadi tuutane ke samay unhen kareeb 180 million dollar mili
 Jack Welsh's third wife, Suzy Wetlaufer, also co-wrote Welsh's 2005 book Winning, titled Suzy Welsh
 wetalofar ne kuch samay ke liye harvard bijanas rivyuu ke pradhan sampadak ke taur par kaary kiya, lekin 2002 ke shuru main unhen istifa dena padaa kyonki wetalofer ne yah baat sweekaar kar lee thi ki magazine ke liye welsh kaa ek intervyuu taiyaar karte samay ve or welsh ek-duusare se prem karne lage the
 In May 1995, Welsh underwent bypass surgery three times

 The wavelength of the scattering radiation depends only on the angle of scattering
 compton prabhaav ke spashtikaran ke liye 1923 i
 main kaanpton or debaai ne swatantra rup se yah dharna apanaai ki kisi disha main chalate hue photaan main jo urja / samveg hota he unka kul Or may give only a small portion
 isse prakeern photaan kii urja, jisamen plank sthiraank he or vikiran kii aavriti he, apati photaan kii urja se kam hoti he or photaan se sambandhit tarangaayam bad jaataa he
 This is clearly contrary to the wave theory of photon-electron-collision-pattern radiation
 san 1924 i
 main bor, creckers or slator ne ek duusare praturup kaa suzav rakhaa jo tarangvaad par aadhaarit tha
 In this model, the laws of energy stability and momentum are applied only to the statistical mean of multiple collisions, rather than to any solitary interaction of radiation and electrons
 atev apati vikiran tamson ke tarangavaadi praturup ke anuroop satat prakeern hota he, par saath main kabhi-kabhi ek pratikshep electron bhi prakirnak se nikalataa he
 This model was successful in explaining the increase in wavelength due to the vibrational result, but ultimately became invalid on the basis of some experimental results, and only the photon – electron – collision-model of validation, computation, and debi was found
 kaanpton-debaai-praturup ke anusaar pratikshipt electron or prakeern vikiran kaa utpaadan saath hi saath hona aavashyak he
 According to quantum mechanics in this simultaneity, the time uncertainty is about 10–21 seconds and in the latest experiments, the time constant has reached close enough to this limit

 In this model, in addition to the initial and final positions of the interaction, there is also a medium state, in which only the momentum remains constant, not energy
 is ant:sth sthiti main ek electron ek photaan ko utshaarit kar saktaa he yaa ek photaan kaa avasorana kar saktaa he
 Thus, there is a possibility of two options in the Kapton result: in donon vikalpon kaa vichaar karke electron ke vidyucchumbakeey vikiran ke prakirnan kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he or usase jo nishkarsh nikle hai ve aadhunik prayogon dwaara urja ke paryaapt vistaar ke liye siddh kiye ja chuke hai
 The conclusions of compton-debai are particular forms of this general conclusion

 However, the Prime Minister cannot do the appointment, expulsion and other such functions of the ministers themselves
 mantriyon kii niyukti va nishkasana raashtrapati dwaara pradhanmantri ke salaah par hota he
 The Constitution of India respectively promulgates a number of legislations that have legally ensured that in normal circumstances, in the case of the executive, the President should have only nominal powers, while the actual powers are in the hands of the Prime Minister
 samvidhan ne pradhanmantri or raashtrapati kii shaktiyon ko bhaag 5 ke vibhinn anuchhedon main kuch is prakaar ankit kiya gaya he: Generally, the Prime Minister is appointed by the President on the basis of the result of the parliamentary general election
 pradhanmantri, loksabhaa main bahumat-dhari dal ke netaa hote hai
 Although the Prime Minister does not have to be a Lok Sabha MP himself, he has to prove his majority in the Lok Sabha and become a member of Parliament within six months of his appointment
 pradhanmantri sansad ke donon sadanon main se kisi bhi ek sadan ke sadsy ho sakate hai
 Historically, there have been many Prime Ministers who were Rajya sabha-mps; In 1966, Indira Gandhi, Deve Gowda and more recently Manmohan Singh, were Rajya sabha-mps
 prayek chunaav pashchaat, naveen sabha kii baithak main bahumat daal ke netaa ke chunaav ke baad, raashtrapati, bahumat-dhari dal ke netaa ko pradhanmantri banane hetu aamantrit karte hai, aamantran sweekaar karne ke pashchaat, sambandhit vyakti ko loksabhaa main matdaan dwaara vishwasamat praapt karnaa hota he
 Thereafter the order of confidence is passed on to the President, after which the Prime Minister and other ministers are administered the oath of office and they are appointed as Prime Ministers at a ceremony
 yadi koi ek dal yaa gathbandhan, loksabhaa main bahumat praapt karne main aksham hota he, to, yah purnatah mahamahim raashtrapati ke vivek par nirbhar hota he ki ve kis vyakti ko pradhanmantripad praapt karne hetu aamantrit karen
 Such a situation is called a state of hung assembly
 trishanku sabha kii sthiti main raashtrapati saadharantah sabase bade dal ke netaa ko nimnasadan main bahumat siddh karne hetu aamantrit karte he
 It is mandatory for a person who accepts the invitation to prove his trust in the Lok Sabha and only then can that person be appointed Prime Minister
 aitihaasik taur par, is visheshadhikaar kaa prayog anek avasaron par vibhinn raashtrapatigan kar chuke hai
 After the resignation of Prime Minister Morarji Desai by President Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy in 1977, Chaudhary Charan Singh was appointed Prime Minister, exercising this same privilege
 iske alaava bhi is visheshadhikaar kaa upyog kar, raashtrapatigan ne 1989 main rajeev gandhi or vishwanath pratap singh, 1991 main narsingh raav tathaa 1996 or 1998 main atal bihari vaajapeyi ko pradhanmantripad par niyukt karne ke liye kiya he
 The cabinet is made up of ministers selected by the Prime Minister and appointed by the President
 bhartiya samvidhan, pradhanmantri pad hetu kisi prakaar kii vishesh arhataayen nirdisht nahin karata he
 But one need has been fixed: the Prime Minister should have the membership of Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha, and they should have majority support in Lok Sabha
 yadi niyukti ke samay paatr, bhartiya sansad ke do sadanon main se kisi bhi sadan kaa sadsy nahin hota he to niyukti ke 6 maheenon ke madhya hi unhen sansad kii sadsyta praapt karnaa anivaary he anyathaa unka pradhanmantritv khaarij ho jaayegaa
 Therefore, the claimant to the Prime Minister must have all the qualifications to be an MP
 bhartiya samvidhan ke pancham bhaag kaa 84vaan anuchhed, ek saansad kii arhataaon ko nirdisht karata he, uske anusaar: a person shall be qualified to be elected to fill a place in Parliament only when— jaisaa ki tisare bindu main vinirdisht he, paatr ko sansad dwaara bhavishya main paarit paatrata ke kisi bhi yogayata par khara utaarna hoga tathaa kyonki pradhanmantri kaa saansad hona anivaary he, atah pradhanmantritv ke paatr ko loksabhaa yaa rajyasabha kaa sadsy hone yogya hone hetu, kuch anya arhataaon par bhi khara utarana hota he, jinamein uskaa vikrut charitra vaala vyakti yaa diwalia ghoshit naa hona, swechha se kisi videshi rajya kii naagarikta praapt kar lenaa, kisi nyaayalay dwaara uskaa nirvachan shunya ghoshit kar diya janaa, tathaa raashtrapati yaa rajyapal niyukt hona shaamil hai
 Also, an eligible person should not be an employee of any beneficial post in the service of any office and administrative or non-administrative body under the Central Government, any State Government or any of the aforesaid Government
 saath hi sadan se prastaav-sweekrut nishkasana se bhi paatr kii sadsyta samaapt ho jaati he
 After the appointment, the Prime Minister's disqualification, on any of the foregoing qualifications, is proved in a legal court, then the election of that person is declared void, and he is expelled from the post of Prime Minister
 
 pradhanmantri ko pad kii shapath raashtrapati dwaara dilaai jaati he
 For appointment to the post, the prospective officer is required to take two oaths
 ye donon shapath bhartiya samvidhan kii teesri anusuchee main vinirdisht hai, 99, 124, 148, 164, 188 or 219): Types of Pledge or Affirmation: 1 mantripad kii shapath kaa praaroop : 2 Form of Oath of Privacy: saiddhanthik rupatah, padasth pradhanmantri, "raashtrapati ke prasadparyant", apane pad par bana rahata he
 Unlike the President, no time limit has been set for the Prime Minister's term
 atah ek padasth pradhanmantri anishchit kaal tak pradhanmantripad par bana rah saktaa he, basharte ki raashtrapati ko usapar "vishwaas" ho
 The real meaning of this is that a person can hold the post of Prime Minister only as long as the majority in the Lok Sabha is in his favor
 baharhaal, loksabhaa kaa puraa kaarykaal 5 varsh hota he, jiske baad nae chunaav karaaye jate hai, or naveen sabha punah pradhanmantri ke paksh main vishwasamat paarit karti he, yadi nav-nirvaachit sabha pradhanmantri main avishvaas ghoshit kar detii he to phir pradhanmantri kaa kaarykaal samaapt ho jaataa he
 Therefore, it can be said that the Prime Minister has a full term of 5 years, after which he is reviewed again
 baharhaal, pradhanmantri kaa kaarykaal 5 varshon se purv hi samaapt ho saktaa he, yadi kisi karanvash, loksabhaa sarkaar ke virodh main avishvaas mat paarit kare athwa yadi kisi karanvash, pradhanmantri kii sansad kii sadsyta shunaya ghoshit ho jaae to pradhanmantri, kisi bhi samay, apane pad kaa tyaag, raashtrapati ko ek likhit tyaagptr saunp ke kar sakate hai
 Prime Minister Morarji Desai was the first Prime Minister of the country to relinquish his office during his tenure
 pradhanmantri ke kaarykaal par naa hi kisi prakaar kii samay-seemaa he naa koi aayu seemaa nirdisht kii gai he
 India Gateway bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 74 main spasht rup se mantriparishad kii adhyakshata tathaa sanchaalan hetu pradhanmantri kii upasthiti aavashyak maanata he
 In the event of his death or resignation, the entire council has to step down
 vah akele hi mantri parishad kaa gathan karata he
 The President appoints the Minister on his advice only
 mantri gana ke vibhaag kaa nirdhaaran bhi vahi karata he
 The function of the cabinet also does the same
 desh ke prashasan ko nirdesh bhi vahi detaa he
 All policy decisions are taken by him
 raashtrapati tathaa mantri parishad ke madhyasampark sutara bhi vahi he
 He is also the principal spokesman of the Council of Ministers
 vah parishad ke naam se ladi jane vaali sansadeey bahason kaa netritv karata he
 He can participate in any debate being fought in favor of the Council in Parliament
 mantri gana ke madhya samanvay bhi vahi karata he
 He can ask for any information from any ministry
 in sab karnow ke chalate pradhanmantri ko bharat kaa sabase mahatvapurn rajnatik vyaktitv mana jaataa he
 The most important reason for the dominance and importance of the Indian Prime Minister is the executive powers conferred on his office bearers
 samvidhan kaa anuchhed 74 pradhanmantri ke pad ko sthapit karata he, evam yah nirdisht karata he ki ek mantriparishad hogi jiskaa mukhiya pradhanmantri hoga, jo bharat ke raashtrapati ko "salaah or sahaayta" pradaan karenge
 And Article 75 establishes that the appointment of ministers will be done by the President as per the advice of the Prime Minister, and the minister will also be given various assignments as per the advice of the President, Prime Minister
 atah samvidhan yah nirdisht karata he kii, jahaan sanvaidhanik kaaryakari adhikaar bharat ke raashtrapati ke paas he, parantu kyonki in sambandhon main bharat ke raashtrapati keval pradhanmantri kii salaahnusaar kaary karte hai, atah vaastavik rup se, in kaaryakari adhikaron kaa prayog pradhanmantri apni icchaanusaar karte hai
 The constitution establishes by these legislations that as the head of the nation of India, the Prime Minister shall exercise all the executive powers vested indirectly, and will be the head of the entire Council of Ministers and constitution of the Council of Ministers by Article 75, appointment of ministers
 And his assignment has also been left to the will of the Prime Minister, but also the ministers and ministers
 The Constitution, the Prime Minister in relation to schools provides complete freedom
 pradhanmantri, apane mantrimandal main kisi bhi vyakti ko shaamil kar sakate he, nikaal sakate he, niyukt kar sakate hai yaa nilambit karvaa sakate hai
 Since ministers are appointed by the President only on the advice of the Prime Minister, it means that the Council of Ministers is actually created by people of the Prime Minister's choice, in which they can change at any time of their choice
 saath hi mantriyon ko vibhinn kaarybhaar pradaan karnaa bhi purnatah pradhanmantri kii ichha par nirbhar karata he; ve apane mantriyon main se kisi ko bhi koi bhi mantralay yaa kaarybhaar saunp sakati hai, chin sakate hai yaa doosraa koi kaarybhaar / mantralay saunp sakate hai
 In these cases there is no constitutional obligation of any kind to the Prime Minister to consult the ministers concerned, or to obtain their permission
 balki mantriyon va mantralayon ke vishay main purvakthith kisi bhi maamle main sambandhit mantri yaa mantriyon kii salaah yaa anumati praapt karne kii, pradhanmantri par kisi bhi prakaar kii sanvaidhanik baadhyataa nahin he
 They can also ask any minister to resign from the minister any time they want, and if that minister refuses to resign, they can ask the president to suspend him from office
 mantriyon kii niyukti evam mantralayon ke aavnton ke alaava, mantrimandaleey sabhaayen, cabinet kii gatividhiyaan or sarkaar kii nitiyon par bhi pradhanmantri kaa puraa niyantran hota he
 The Prime Minister is the constitutional head and leader of the Council of Ministers
 ve sansad evam anya manchon par mantriparishad kaa pratinidhitiv karte he
 They preside over cabinet meetings, and decide the agenda of these meetings, and other topics of discussion
 balki cabinet baithkon main uthne vaale saare maamle va vishaysoochee, pradhanmantri kii hi sweekruti va sahmati se nirdhaarit kiye jate hai
 It is at the will of the Prime Minister to approve or reject various proposals that arise in cabinet meetings
 haalaanki, charchaa karne or apane nijee suzav va prastaavon ko baithak ke samaksh rakhane kii swatantraaa har mantri ko he, parantu antytah vahi prastaav yaa nirnay liya jaataa he, jisapar pradhanmantri kii sahmati ho or nirnay paarit kiye jane ke pashchaat use puure mantriparishad kaa antim nirnay mana jaataa he, or sabhi mantriyon ko pradhanmantri ke us nirnay ke saath chalanaa hota he
 Therefore, it can be said that as a constitutionally, the Prime Minister has complete control and unchallenged dominance over the Union Cabinet
 niyantran ke maamle main pradhanmantri, mantriparishad kaa sarvesarva hota he, or uske istife se puri sarkaar gir jaati he, arthath saare mantriyon kaa mantritv samaapt ho jaataa he
 Apart from the chairmanship of the Council of Ministers, the Constitution vests another special privilege on the Prime Minister, this privilege being the mid-contact thread between the Council of Ministers and the President
 yah visheshadhikaar keval pradhanmantri ko diya gaya he, jiske madhyam se pradhanmantri samay-samay par, raashtrapati ko mantrisabha main liye jane vaale nirnay or charchaaon se sambandhit jaankaree se raashtrapati ko adhishuchet karaate rahete hai
 No minister other than the Prime Minister can voluntarily reveal to the President any of the subjects discussed in the Council
 yah visheshadhikaar kii mahatv va arth yah he kii mantrimandaleey sabhaaon main charchit vishyon main se kin jaankariyon ko gopneey rakhana he, evam kin jaankariyon ko duniya ke saamne prastut karnaa he, yah tay karne kaa adhikaar bhi pradhanmantri ke paas he
 The Prime Minister works as the Chief Manager of the various organs of the state, whose job is to get all the departments and organs of the state to do the work as they wish
 sarkaar ke vibhinn vibhaagon or mantralayon ke bich samanvay bananaa, or cabinet dwaara liye gaye nirnyon ko karyanvit karwaanaa tathaa vibhinn vibhaagon ko nirdeshit karnaa bhi unka kaam he
 It is also their job to resolve administrative differences between ministries and departments and take final decisions
 sarkari kaaryon ke karyanvayan ke alaava bhi, sarkari tantra par pradhanmantri kaa atyadhik prabhaav or pakad hota he
 Being the head of government and government, all the executive appointments are actually made by the Prime Minister
 saare ucchstareey adhikari va padaadhikari pradhanmantri, apane pasand ke hi niyukt karte hai
 These appointments include high-advisors and high officials of government ministries and offices, governors of various states, attorney generals, auditors, overlords of public service commissions, and other members, ambassadors of various countries, consulars, etc
 yah saare ucchstareey niyuktiyaan, bharat ke raashtrapati dwaara, pradhanmantri kii salaah par kiye jate hai
 Being the head of the government and the Council of Ministers, the Prime Minister is the leader of the majority and the leader of the ruling house and the principal representative in the Lok Sabha
 is sandarbh main, sadan main sarkaar or sattapaksh kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa pradhanmantri kaa karttavya mana jaataa he
 At the same time it is expected that the Prime Minister will make important bills and announcements taken by the government in the House and the Prime Minister will answer from the ruling side about those important decisions
 loksabhaa adhyaksh kaa chunaav, nirvachan dwaara hota he, atah saadharantah, sabhapati bhi bahumat daal kaa hota he
 Therefore, being the leader of the majority of pulses, through the Speaker, the Prime Minister also has the ability to influence the proceedings of the Lok Sabha in a limited way, as the Chairman is the Speaker of the House, and the Chairman also determines the table of contents in the House
 However, the action of the House cannot be affected to a greater extent
 in kartavyon ke alaava, sansadeey karrwai ko par pradhanmantri kaa sabase mahatvapurn shakti he, loksabhaa satr bulaane or satrant karne kii shakti
 Article 85 of the constitution gives the President of India the right to call and end the session of the Lok Sabha, but in this case the President has to act according to the advice of the Prime Minister
 arthath vaastavikrupe, loksabhaa kaa satr bulaanaa or ant karnaa pradhanmantri ke haathon main hota he
 This right is, undoubtedly, the most important right given in the hands of the Prime Minister, which gives him an opportunity to have limited control not only on his party but also on the activities of the opposition mps
 sarkaar or desh ke netaa hone ke naate, vaishvik manch par bharat kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa pradhanmantri kii sabase mahatvapurn zimmedaariyon main se ek he
 The Prime Minister has the most important role in determining the global policy of the Indian state, due to his immense control over the government and the Council of Ministers

 The Ministry of External Affairs of India handles global relations and related matters, for which an independent cabinet minister is also appointed in the name of the foreign minister, but because foreign policies, etc
, the Prime Minister determines, therefore, the Foreign Minister is ultimately decided by the Prime Minister
 Implements the decisions and policies taken
 vibhinn deshon se samrik, aarthik, kootnithik, vanijyik or sansadhanik, ityadi sandhiyaan or samjhaute, tathaa unase judi kootnithik bahes or vaartaon main pradhanmantri kaa kirdaar sabase mahatvapurn hota he, or aisi vaartaon main ve desh kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 It is also the responsibility of the Prime Minister to welcome and host the Heads of State and Delegations of various countries

 He represents India in international organizations such as United Nations, G20, BRICS, SAARC, non-aligned Movement, Commonwealth, etc
, and stands for India
 antarrashtriya manch par desh kii chhavi banane, or kootnithik vaartaon dwaara desh ke hit kii aapurti karne main pradhanmantri kaa sthaan behad mahatvapurn he
 The Constitution of India, being the head of the national head and all strategic forces, gives the President of India the right to declare war and peace from any other country, but its real authority lies with the Prime Minister, because according to the advice of the Prime Minister in this matter Are bound to work yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke alaava, yuddh kii ranneeti nirdhaarit karnaa tathaa samrik balon ko niyantrit karnaa bhi pradhanmantri dwaara hi hota he tathaa shanti-ghoshnaa karnaa or shanti-samjhauta karnaa bhi pradhanmantri kaa karttavya he

 Prominent among these duties is the Prime Minister's address to the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort in Delhi every year on the occasion of Independence Day

 15 agast ke bhaashan ke alaava, prativarsh, 26 janvari ko ganatantraa diwas ke din, rajpath par ganatantraa diwas ke samaaroh kii prarambh se purv, pradhanmantri, desh ke taraf se, amar jawan jyoti par pushpamala arpit kar, bhartiya suraksha balon ke shahid sainikon ko shradhanjali arpit karte he
