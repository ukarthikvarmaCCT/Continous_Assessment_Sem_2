 Macdonald saanchaa:multiplex techniques Code division multiple access is a method of using a channel that is used in different radio communication technologies
 isko lekar mobile phone maanakon ke vishay main bhramit nahin hona chahie, jo cdmaone or CDMA2000 kehalaate hai kaha jaataa he, jo CDMA kaa upyog ek anternihit channel acces vidhi ke rup main karte hai
 a basic concept in data communication is the idea of allowing different transmitters to simultaneously send information to the same communication channel
 This allows multiple users to share a bandwidth of different frequencies
 yah avadharana bahusanketan kehalaati he
 CDMA offers spread-spectrum technology and a special coding scheme that allows multiple users to multiplex on the same physical channel
 iske vipareet, samay vibhaajan bahu abhigam acces ko samay ke anusaar vibhajit kar detaa he, jabaki aavriti-vibhaajan bahu abhigam ise aavruti ke anusaar vibhajit karata he
 CDMA is a form of "spread-spectrum" signaling, since the modulated coded signal has a much higher data bandwidth than the data being transmitted
 multiple acces kii ek samasya kaa ek rup he vah cameraa jisamen log ek dusre ke saath baatcheet karnaa chaahate hai
 To avoid confusion, people can bend themselves while speaking, speak at different pitches, or speak in different languages
 CDMA corresponds to the previous example, where people who speak the same language can understand each other
 But other people do not
 Similarly, in radio CDMA, each group of users is given a shared code
 kai code samaan channel par hote hai, lekin ek vishesh code se sambandhit upyogkarta hi ek duusare ko samaj sakate hai
 CDMA is a spread spectrum multiple access technology
 ek sprad spectrum takanic vah takanic he jo samaan rup se sancharit kii gayi power ke liye data ke bandwidth ko samaan rup se failaati he
 The spreading code is a pseudorandom code that has a narrow fuzzy function unlike other narrow pulse codes
 CDMA main sancharit hone vaale data kii tulana main ek sthaneey rup se utpann code adhik teevr dar se sanchalit hota he
 The data for transmission is simply logically XOR associated with fast code
 aankada darshata he ki kis tarah se sprad spectrum signal kaa utpaadan hota he
 The data signal consisting of a pulse duration of t b { \ displaystyle T_ {b}} is XOR coupled with a code signal consisting of a pulse duration of t c { \ displaystyle T_ {c}}
 isliye, data signal kaa bandwidth 1 / t b { \ displaystyle 1 / T_{b}} he or sprad spectrum signal kaa bandwidth 1 / t c { \ displaystyle 1 / T_{c}} he
 Since t c { \ displaystyle T_ {c}} is much smaller than t b { \ displaystyle T_ {b}}, the bandwidth of the spread spectrum signal is much larger than the bandwidth of the original signal
 anupaat t b / t c { \ displaystyle T_{b} / T_{c}} spreading fector yaa processing gen kehalaata he or ek aadhaar stesan ke dwaara swatah samarthit upyogkartaaon kii kul sankhya kii ucch seemaa ke str ko nirdhaarit karata he
 Output of a CDMA signal CDMA pranali main prayek upyogkarta apane signlon ko modulate karne ke liye ek bhinn code kaa upyog karata he
 The selection of the code used to modulate the signal is very important in the performance of a CDMA system
 sabase acha pradarshan tab hoga jab ek vaanchit upyogkarta ke signal or anya upyogkarta ke signal ke bich acha pruthakkaran ho
 signlon kaa pruthakkaran, praapt kiye gaye signal ko, vaanchit upyogkarta ke sthaneey rup se utpann code ke saath sambandhit kar ke kiya jaataa he
 If the signal matches the code of the desired user, the relationship function will be high and the system can extract the signal
 yadi vaanchit upyogkarta ke code main signal ke saath kuch bhi saamaanya nahin he to jahaan tak sambhav ho, sambandh shunya ke najadik hona chahie ; yah kros sambandh kehalaata he
 If the code relates to a signal of offset at any time other than zero, the relationship should be as close to zero as possible
 This is called autocorrelation and is used to reject the multi-path conclusion
 saamaanya rup main, CDMA do mul shreniyon se sambandhit he: tulykaalik ) or atulykaalik )
 Synchronous CDMA uses the mathematical properties of orthogonality between the vectors representing data chains
 udhaaharan ke liye, binary shrinkhalaa "1011" ko sadish ke dwaara abhivyakt kiya jaataa he
 Vectors can be multiplied by taking their point product, for which the product of their respective components is used
 yadi bindu gunanfal shunya he, to donon sadishon ko ek duusare ke liye orthogonal kaha jaataa he or v=, bindu gunanfal u·v = a*c + b*d)
 bindu gunanfal ke kuch gundharm yah samajhane main madad karte hai ki W-CDMA kis prakaar se kaary karata he
 If vector a and b are orthogonal, then tulykaalik CDMA main prayek upyogkarta apane signlon ko modulate karne ke liye ek aise code kaa upyog karata he jo duusare code ke liye orthogonal hota he
 An example of four interconnected digital signals is shown in the figure
 orthogonal kods main main ek kros sambandh hota he, jo shunya ke baraabar hota he; duusare shabdon main, ve ek duusare ke saath hastkshep nahin karte hai
 In the case of IS-95 64 bit, Walsh codes are used to encode the signal to isolate different users
 chunki 64 walsh kods main se prayek ek duusare ke liye orthogonal hote hai, signlon ko 64 orthogonal signlon main chenlikrut kiya jaataa he
 The following example shows how each user signal can be encoded or decoded
 vaikatars ke aise samucchy ke saath shuru karen jo ek duusare ke liye orthogonal hai
 And and the data that the user wants to transmit is related to it, which will then be created in binary, as,)
 is anuchhed ke prayojanon ke liye, ham is nirmit vactor ko sancharit vactor kehete hai
 Each sender has a different, unique vector v, chosen from the set, but the method of constructing the transmitted vectors is the same
 ab, hastkshep ke bhautik gunon ke kaaran, ek bindu par do signal samaan pravastha main hai, ve prayek signal ke aayam kaa doguna dene ke liye yoga karte hai, lekin yadi ve pravastha se baahar hai, ve "ghat " jate hai or ek aisa signal dete hai jo aayam se alag hota he
 Digitally, this behavior can be modeled by the sum of transmission vacators, component by component
 yadi preshak0 kaa code or data he or preshak1 kaa code or data he or donon preshak ek saath sancharan karte hai, to yah sarini koden ke padon ko darshaati he: Because signal 0 and signal 1 are transmitted in air at the same time, they sum to give the raw signal: + = yah kaccha signal hastkshep praturup kehalaata he
 The recipient then extracts a signal for a known sender by combining the sender's code with the interference model
 nimnlikhit sarini spasht karti he ki yah kaise kaary karata he or darshaati he ki signal ek duusare ke saath hastkshep nahin karte hai
 Furthermore, after decoden, all values larger than 0 are considered 1, whereas all values below zero are considered 0
 udhaaharan ke liye, dicoden ke baad, data0 he, lekin praptakarta ise maanata he
 We can also consider, what happens if a recipient tries to decode a signal when the user has not sent any information
 Suppose the signal 0 = is transmitted alone
 nimnlikhit sarini praptakarta par dicode ko darshaati he
 When the recipient tries to decode the signal using sender 1's code, the data is completely zero, so the cross relation is equal to zero and it is clear that sender 1 has not sent any data
 orthogonal walsh anukram kaa purv udhaaharan bataata he ki kaise 2 upyogkarta ek tulykaalik pranali main ek duusare ke saath multiplex hote hai, ek takanic jise aamtaur par code divijan multiplexing kaha jaataa he
 The set of 4 Walsh sequences shown in the figure will hold up to 4 users, and in general, an nxn Walsh matrix can be used for multiplex n users
 bahusanketan ke liye aavashyak he ki sabhi upyogkarta samanvit ho jaayen taaki prayek unhen die gaye anukram v kaa sancharan kare, taaki ve thik usee samay par praptakarta ke paas pahunch jaayen
 is prakaar, yah takanic aadhaar-se-mobile sambandh main upyog paati he, jahaan sabhi sancharan samaan transmeter se utpann hote hai or inhen purnataya samanvit kiya ja saktaa he
 On the other hand, mobile-to-base links cannot be fully coordinated, especially due to the mobility of the handset and require another approach
 chunki ganitiya rup se aise hastakshar anukram kaa nirmaan karnaa yah sambhav nahin he jo yadrichhik shuruaati bindu ke liye orthogonal hon, adwitiya "kuta-yadrichhik " yaa "kuta-dhwani " anukram atulykaalik CDMA pranali main prayukt kiya jate hai
 a PN code is a binary sequence that appears to be random but can be reproduced in a defined manner by the intended recipient
 in PN kods kaa upyog atulykaalik CDMA main ek upyogkarta signal ko encode or dicode karne ke liye usee prakaar se kiya jaataa he, jaise tulykaalik CDMA main orthogonal kods kaa 
 ye PN anukram sankhyikeey rup se sambandhit nahin hote hai or PN anukram kii ek badi sankhya kaa yoga, multiple acces hastkshep kaa kaaran banataa he, jinka anumaan ek gousi shor prakriya ke dwaara lagaaya jaataa he 
 yadi sabhi upyogkarta samaan power kshamta praapt karte hai, to MAI kaa bhinnata upyogkartaaon ke pratyaksha anupaat main badhati he
 In other words, unlike synchronous CDMA, signals from other users appear as noise signals of interest and interfere with the desired signal in proportion to the number of users
 CDMA ke sabhi rup, avaanchit signlon ke khilaaf aanshik rup se vibhed karne main praptakarta ko madad karne ke liye sprad spectrum prakriya laabh kaa upyog karte hai
 Signals encoded along the specified PN sequence are received, while signals with different codes appear as wideband sound subtracted by the process gain
 chunki prayek upyogkarta MAI utpann karata he, signal kii kshamta kaa niyantran karnaa CDMA transmeter ke saath ek mahatvapurn mudda hota he
 a CDM, TDMA or FDMA receiver theoretically completely rejects random dominant signals using different codes, time slots, or frequency channels
 iskaa kaaran he in systamon kii orthogonality
 This is not true for asynchronous CDMA; Rejection of unwanted signals is only partial
 yadi koi yaa sabhi avaanchit signal vaanchit signal se adhik prabal hai, ve is par prabhavi ho jaayenge
 That is why it is common requirement in any asynchronous CDMA system to have different signal power levels nearly matched
 In CDMA cellular, the base station uses a rapid closed-loop power control scheme to strictly control the transmission capacity of each mobile
 Does

 Effective experimental use of fixed frequency spectrum
 CDM, TDMA or FDMA par atulykaalik CDMA kaa mukhya laabh yah he ki yah mobile telephoni anuprayog main spectrum kaa upyog adhik prabhavi rup se karata he
 In theory, CDMA, TDMA and FDMA have similar spectral efficiency, but experimentally everyone has their own challenges - capacity control in terms of CDMA, time in case of TDMA and frequency output / filter in case of FDMA
 TDMA system ko sabhi upyogkartaaon ke sancharan samay kaa tulykaalan saavdhaneepurvak karnaa hota he taaki sunishchit kiya ja sake ki ve sahi samay avadhi main praapt kiye gayi hai or kisi hastkshep kaa kaaran nahin hai
 Since it cannot be fully controlled in a mobile environment, each time slot must have a guard-time, which reduces the possibility of users' interference, but reduces the efficiency or effectiveness of the spectrum
 
 isi tarah, FDMA system ko agragami channelon ke bich ek guard-band kaa upyog karnaa chahie, iskaa kaaran he signal spectrum kaa apratyaashit dopler shift jo upyogkarta kii gatishiltaa ke kaaran utpann hota he
 The guard-band will reduce the probability of interference of the forward channel, but will reduce the usefulness of the spectrum

 sansadhano kaa lacheela aavanton Asynchronous CDMA offers one main advantage in flexible allocation of resources, ie the allocation of a PN code for active users
 CDM, TDMA or FDMA ke maamle main ek saath hone vaale orthogonal kods, samay slot or aavriti slot kii sankhya, krmanusaar sthir ho jaati he, isliye ek hi samay ke upyogkartaaon kii sankhya ke shabdon main kshamta simit hoti he
 The number of orthogonal codes, time slots, or frequency bands that are assigned to CDM, TDMA, and FDMA systems is unadjusted due to the telecast trend of telephony and packet-locked data transmission
 upyogkartaaon kii sankhya kii koi sakhat seemaa nahin hoti he, jinhen ek atulykaalik CDMA pranali main samarthan diya ja saktaa he, vanchit bit truti sambhaavna ke dwaara niyantrit keval ek praayogic seemaa hoti he, chunki SIR upyogkartaaon kii sankhya ke anusaar bahut bhinnata rakhte hai
 The advantage of asynchronous CDMA in a sluggish traffic environment such as telephony is that pradarshan ko yadrichhik rup se utaar chadhaav kii anumati di jaati he, jisamen ausat maan kaa nirdhaaran upyogkarta ke samay kii sankhya or upyogita kii pratishtata ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Suppose there are 2N users who only talk for half the time, then 2N users can be placed with the same average bit error probability, when n users talk the whole time
 yahaan mukhya antar yah he ki saare samay baat karne vaale n upyogkartaaon kii bit truti sambhaavna sthir he, jabaki yah ek yadrichhik maatra he 
 For 2N users who talk for half the time
 duusare shabdon main, atulykaalik CDMA ek mobile network ke liye adarsh rup se upyukt he, jahaan transmitaron kii ek badi sankhya main se prayek aniyamit antaraal par ek apekshaakrit choti maatra kaa treffic utpann karti he
 CDM, TDMA and FDMA systems cannot retrieve unadapted resources due to burst traffic, because the number of orthogonal codes, time slots, and frequency channels is constant, which can be passed to an individual transmitter
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi ek TDMA pranali main n samay slot or 2N upyogkarta he jo aadhe samay ke liye baat karte hai, to to aadhe samay ke liye n se adhik upyogkartaaon ko n samay slots se zyada upyog kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 iske alaava, ise orthogonal code, samay slot or aavruti channel sansaadhan ke nirantar aavanton yaa vi-aavanton ke liye mahatvapurn overhead kii zarurat hogi
 When compared to this, asynchronous CDMA transmitters normally transmit when they have something to say and to send to the air, during which time they remain connected to the system, the same PN signature sequence
 Keep it up

 PN anukram kii railpel kshamtaaon ke kaaran sprad spectrum CDMA main gopneeyata kii suraksha
 Most modulation schemes try to reduce the signal's bandwidth because bandwidth is a finite source
 haalanki, sprad spectrum takanic ek sancharan bandwidth kaa prayog karti he, arthath aayam ke bhinn kram nunatam aavashyak signal bandwidth se adhik hote hai
 An early reason for doing this was military applications with guidance and communication systems
 isaki suraksha or jeming ke liye pratirodh ke kaaran is systams ko sprad spectrum kaa upyog karte hue dizin kiya gaya tha
 Asynchronous CDMA has some built-in level of confidentiality because the signal is transmitted using a pseudorandom code; Because of this code, spread spectrum signals appear randomly or have sound-like properties
 ek praptakarta data ko encode karne ke liye prayukt gyaan ke bina is sancharan ko demodulate nahin kar saktaa he
 CDMA is also resistant to jamming
 ek jeming signal main keval signal ko jam karne ke liye uplabdh kshamta kii parimit seemaa hoti he
 The jammer either propagates its energy over the entire bandwidth of the signal or jams any part of the entire signal
 CDMA prabhavi rup se sankare band ke hastkshep ko asweekrut kar saktaa he
 Since narrow band interference affects only a small portion of the spread spectrum signal, it can be easily removed by notch filtering without much loss of information
 konvolushan encoding or interliving kaa prayog khoye hue data ko punah praapt karne main madad karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 CDMA signals also prevent multilayer fading
 chunki sprad spectrum signal ke paas ek bada bandwidth hota he, die gaye samay main bahupath ke kaaran iskaa keval ek chota sa bhaag feding main se hokar gujarata he
 Like narrowband interference this will result in very little loss of data and can be retrieved
 ek anya kaaran he CDMA bahupath hataakshep ke liye pratirodhi he, kyonki sancharit kuta- yadrichhik code ke deree se hue sanskaran ke paas mul kuta- yadrichhik code ke sambandh kamjor hoga or is prakaar se yah anya upyogkarta ke rup main prakat hoga, jise praptakarta par upekshit kiya jaataa he
 In other words, as long as the multipath channel induces at least one chip of delay, the multipath signals reach the receiver so that they shift in time by at least one chip from the scheduled signal
 kuta- yadrichhik code ke sambandh gun is prakaar ke hai ki yah nirdhaarit signal se asambandhit bahupath ke prakat hone main kuch deree kaa kaaran banataa he or is prakaar se yah upekshit ho jaataa he
 Some CDMA devices use a rake receiver, which uses a multilayer delay component to improve the system's performance
 ek rek praptakarta kai sambandhakon se praapt jaankaree ko sanyojit karata he, prayek ek bhinn path deree kii or mud jaati he or prabalatam signal ke path deree kii or mudane vaale ekmaatr sambandhak se yukt saadhaaran praptakarta kii tulana main signal kaa ek prabal sanskaran utpann karti he, Frequency reuse is the ability to reuse the same radio channel frequency at other cell sites within a cellular system
 FDMA or TDMA pranaaliyon main aavriti yojana main ek mahatvapurn vichaar he
 The frequencies used in different cells need to be carefully planned to ensure that signals from different cells do not interfere with each other
 In a CDMA system, the same frequency is used in each cell because channelization is performed using pseudorandom codes
 har cell main samaan aavruti kaa punah upyog ek CDMA pranali main aavruti niyojan kii aavashyaktaa ko khatm kar detaa he; haalanki bhinn kuta-yadrichhik anukramon kaa niyojan kiya janaa chahie, taaki yah sunishchit kiya ja sake ki ek cell se praapt signal paas ke cell se praapt signal se sambandh nahin rakhata he
 Since nearby cells use similar frequencies, the CDMA system has the ability to perform soft handoffs
 soft handophs ek saath do yaa adhik cell ke saath ekasaath sanchaar karne kii anumati dete hai
 The best signal quality is selected until the handoff is complete
 This is different from the hard handoff used in other cellular systems
 ek hard handoph sthiti main, jab mobile telephone ek hand of kii ore rukh karata he, signal kshamta achaanak badal jaati he

 arya samast hinduon tathaa unke manukuleey purvajon kaa vaidic sambodhan he
 Its simple meaning is superior or noble
 arya shabd kaa arth he pragatisheel
 Arya Dharma is considered both the religion of the ancient Aryans and the superior religion
 pracheen aaryon ke dharm main prathmat: prakritik devmandal kii kalpana he jo bharat, main pai jaati rahi he
 In it, many gods have been created between Dyus and Earth

 The development of Arya spiritual philosophy and Arya policy also paralleled
 shuddh naitik aadhaar par avlambit parampara virdohi avaidic sampradaayon-buddha, jain aadi-ne bhi apane dharm ko arya dharm athwa saddharm kaha
 In the social sense, "arya" was first used in the sense of the whole human being
 phir abhijaat or shramik varg main antar dikhaane ke liye arya varna or shudra varna kaa prayog hone laga
 Then the Aryans made the varna the basis of their social system and society divided into four varnas on the basis of instinct and labor
 riksanhita main chaaron varnon kii utpatti or kaary kaa ullekh is prakaar he:- , Vaishya from Uru and Shudra from post
 ) This is a rhetorical sentence
 Brahm is infinite
 The thoughts of that Brahma, the good trends, the community with which the theism is expressed, is called Brahman
 The community which expresses the noise and the fast, the Kshatriya class and the activities necessary to keep the world apart from them, such as agricultural commerce, Brahma Vaishya section
 Is expressed by iske atirikt bhi anek ise kaary batch jate he jinaki maanav jivan main mahatta bahut adhik hoti he jese dastakaari, shilp, vastra nirmaan, seva kshetra brahm apane shudra varg dwaara abhivyakt karata he | In today's language, these classes were intellectual, administrative, professional and labor
 mul main inamen taralata thi
 People of many varnas lived in the same family and had inter-marital relationships and food, drink etc
 kramash: ye varg paraspar varjansheel hote gaye
 These social divisions are found in almost all branches of the Aryan family, although there are country-wide differences in their names and social status
 praarambhik arya parivaar pitrusattatmak tha, yadhyapi aditya, daitya aadi shabdon main matrusatta kii dhwani vartmaan he
 In the imagination of the couple, the husband and wife have equal rights over the family

 Marriage usually took place at a young age
 pati patni ko paraspar nirvachan kaa adhikaar tha
 The marriage was concluded with religious functions, which resembled the later Brahmi marriages
 praarambhik arya samskruti main vidya, sahitya or kala kaa unchaa sthaan he
 The Sanskrit language developed as a powerful medium of knowledge
 isamen kavy, dharm, darshan aadi vibhinn shastron kaa udai hua
 The oldest literature of the Aryans is important from all points of view, the Veda language, poetry and contemplation
 rugveda main brahrichary or shikshanpaddati ke ullekh paae jate hai, jinase pataa lagata he ki shikshanvyavastha kaa sanghathan aarambh ho gaya tha or maanav abhivyaktiyon ne shastreey rup dhaaran karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 The poet is considered a sage in the Rigveda
 vah apni antadrushti se sampurna vishwa kaa darshan karata tha
 In the hymns of Usha, Savitri, Aranyani, etc
, there is a beautiful depiction of natural inspection and beauty and beauty of human being
 rugvedasanhita main poor or gram aadi ke ullekh bhi paae jate hai
 Iron cities, hundreds of stone men, Sahrudwar and Sahrastambha Attalika were built
 saath hi saamaanya grih or kutir bhi banate the

 There is also mention of the dance of daughter
 alankaran kii pratha viksit thi
 Women wore jewels such as Nishka, Ajji, Basi, Vak, Rukm etc
 vividh prakaar ke manovinod main kavy, sangeet, dyut, ghuddaud, rathdaud aadi sammilit the
 In today's era, a group different from Aryans has been established by Dayanand Saraswati
 unka kaary he bharat ko vedon kii ore lautaanaa
 They accept the Advaita and unborn power of God and do not believe in the divinity of Krishnadi and call them great men and completely reject the mythological facts
 haalanki maharishi dayanand ji ke yug main hi unke dwaara pratipaadit siddhant yatha puraana kalpana tathaa avaidic hai, kaa khandan ho chukaa he
 Hence from here the Aryan opinion was divided into two parts
 ek jo puraana tathaa veda or ishwar ke saakaar niraakaar dono sattaaon ko maanane vaale tathaa duusare keval veda or niraakaar satta ko maanane vaale
 In the moral sense, the use of "arya" is found for Mahakul, noble, gentle, gentleman, monk etc
 
 Sayanacharya in his Rigbhashya has given the meaning of "arya" as Vyasa, ritual of Yajna, Vyasa Stota, scholarly revered or omnipotent destination, Uttamvarna, superior to Manu, Karmukta and Karmanushthan etc
 aadarneey ke arth main to sanskrit sahitya main arya kaa bahut prayog hua he
 The wife used to call her husband Aryaputra
 pitamah ko arya or pitamahi ko aryaa kehane kii pratha rahi he
 Arya is said to conduct morally natural: prarambh main "arya' kaa prayog prajati athwa varna ke arth main bhale hi hota rahaa ho, aage chalakar bhartiya itihaas main iskaa naitik arth hi adhik prachlit hua jiske anusaar kisi bhi varna athwa jati kaa vyakti apni shreshthata athwa sajjanta ke kaaran arya kaha jane laga
 There is still a lot of scholarly disagreement regarding the Aryan land of Aryan species
 bhashavaigyanik adhyayan ke prarambh main praaia: bhashaa or prajati ko abhinn maanakar akodbhav siddhant kaa pratipaadan hua or mana gaya ki bhaaropee bhashaaon ke bolanewaale ke purvaj kahin ek hi sthaan main rahete the or vahiin se vibhinn deshon main gaye
 Due to the incompleteness and uncertainty of linguistic evidence, this tribal land has sometimes been Central Asia, sometimes pamir-kashmir
 jabaki bharat se baahar gaye aryan ke nishaan kabhi austria-hungary, kabhi germany, kabhi sweden-norway or aaj dakshin rus ke ghaas ke maidaanon main dhundi jaati he
 Language and species are not necessarily integral
 aaj aaryon kii vividh shakhaon ke bahudbhav hone kaa siddhant bhi prachlit hota ja rahaa he jiske anusaar yah aavashyak nahin ki arya-bhashaa-parivaar kii sabhi jatiyaan ek hi maanavvansh kii rahi hon
 Language has been eclipsed by contact and influence as well, many castes have completely abandoned their native language and adopted the foreign language
 jahaan tak bhartiya aaryon ke udgam kaa prashn he, bhartiya sahitya main unke baahar se aane ke sambandh main ek bhi ullekh nahin he
 According to tradition and tradition, some people have considered Madhya Pradesh and Kajangal and the region between the Himalayas and the Vindhyas or the Aryavarta as the Aryabhoomi of the Aryans
 puranic parampara se vicchhinn keval rugveda ke aadhaar par kuch vidwaanon ne saptsindhu ko aaryon kii adibhumi mana he
 Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak considered the original land of Aryans in Dhruvapradesh on the basis of the long Ahoratra, Prabalit Usha etc
 mentioned in the Rigveda
 bahut se europea vidvan or unke anuyaayi bhartiya vidvan ab bhi bhartiya aaryon ko baahar se aayaa hua maanate hai
 Now the theory of Aryans coming from outside India has been proved wrong
 aisa mana jaataa he ki is siddhanth kaa pratipaadan karke angrez or europea log bharatiyon main yah bhaavana bharna chaahate the ki bhartiya log pehle se hi gulam hai
 Apart from this, the British wanted to divide it between North Indians and South Indians
 isi shrankhla main angrejon ne shudron ko dakshin africa se apni nijee seva v chatukaarita ke liye evam bharat main aaryon se yuddh karne ke liye apni sainik tukdiyaan banane hetu laayaa gaya bataaya he ! jabaki vastav main shudra wo log the jo ardhangn avasthaa main jangalon main ashikshit v pashuon jaisaa jivan vyateet karte the ! The Aryans were aware of the eternal establishment of the world
 unke anusaar prem shakti ke vikaas ke liye sarvyaapee narayan yaa ishwar sthavar-jangam manushya-pashu keet-patang sadhu-paapi shatru-mitra tathaa devtaa or asur ke rup main prakat hokar lila kar rahe hai
 According to Arvind Ghosh, the Aryans used to protect friends and destroy enemies, but they did not have attachment in it
 ve sarvatra, sab praaniyon main, sab vastuon main, karmon main or fal main ishwar ko dekh kar isht-anisht shatru-mitra sukh-dukh tathaa siddhi-asiddhi main sambhaav rakhte the
 The result of this resemblance was not that everything was pleasurable for them and everything was worthy of them
 bina sampoorn yoga ke dwandv nahin mitata he, or yah avasthaa bahut kam logon ko praapt hoti he, kintu arya shiksha saadhaaran aaryon ki sampatti he| arya isht saadhan or anisht ko hataane main sachet rahete the, kintu isht saadhan se vijay ke mad main chur nahin hote the or anisht sampadan main darate bhi na the
 The friend's help and defeat of the enemy were his efforts but he did not hate the enemy and also did not tolerate the friend's injustice
 arya log to kartavya ke anurodh se swajanon kaa sanhaar bhi karte the or vipakshiyon ki praan raksha ke liye yuddh bhi karte the
 He was the remover of sin and the accumulation of virtue but did not take pride in virtuous deeds and did not cry when he became impure in sin, but purified the body and became aware of self-promotion
 arya log karm ki siddhi ke liye vipul prayaas karte the or hajaaron baar vifal hone par bhi virat nahin hote the evam asiddhi main dukhi hona unke liye adharm tha
 The principle of Aryan invasion has been continuously changing since its rest days
 arya-akraman ke siddhant ki adhuniktam pariklpan ke anusaar yah koi jati vishesh nahin thi apitu yah keval ek sammanjanak shabd tha jo ki anglbhasha ke SIR ke samanarthak tha
 All the facts supporting Kalpana of Aryan's invasion have proved to be confusing

 sandhyaa brahma kii maanas putree thi jo tapasya ke bal par agle janm main arundhati ke rup main maharishi vasishtha kii patni bani
 She was wandering in search of Sadhguru near the lake called Brihalohit of Chandrabhaga mountain to do penance
 sandhyaa kii jigyaasa dekhakar maharishi vasishtha vahaan prakat hue or sandhyaa se poocha- kalyani! tum is ghor jangal main kaise vichar rahi ho, tum kiski kanya ho or kya karnaa chaahati ho? sandhyaa kehane lagi- bhagwan! main tapasya karne ke liye is suune jangal main aayi hoon
 Till now i was very excited about how to do penance, i do not know the path of penance
 parantu ab aapako dekhakar mujhe bady shaanti mili he
 Vasisthaji said- You can achieve your desire only by worshiping Lord Vishnu, the God of religion, meaning, work and salvation
 suryamandal main shankh-chakra-gadadhari chaturbhuj vanamali bhagwaan vishnu kaa dhyaan karke namo vasudevy is mantra kaa jap karo or maun rahakar tapasya karo
 Do not eat anything for the first six days, drink water after eating some leaves at night only on the third day and at night on the sixth day
 uske pashchaat teen din tak nirjal upwas karnaa or phir raatri main bhi pani mat pinaa
 God will be pleased with you and will fulfill your wish soon
 is prakaar upadesh karke maharishi vasishtha antardhan ho gayi or vah bhi tapasya kii paddati jaanakar bade anand ke saath bhagwaan kii puja karne lagi
 Thus his penance continued for four epochs
 bhagavan vishnu uski bhaavana ke anusaar rup dhaaran karke uski aankhon ke saamne prakat hue
 Seeing the beautiful image of her Lord riding on Garud, she stood up with confusion and what to say? What to do? Got worried about this
 uski stuti karne kii ichha jaanakar bhagwaan ne use divya gyaan, divya drushti evam divya vaani pradaan kii
 Now she started praising God
 stuti karte-karte vah bhagwaan ke charnon par gir paddy
 God received great pity and he made her heart-rending with amritvarsini vision and asked to ask for the groom
 sandhyaa ne kaha- bhagwan! yadi aap mujh par prasann hai to krupa karke pehla var to yah den ki sansar main paidaa hote hi kisi praani ke man main kaam ke vikaar kaa udai na ho, doosraa var yah dijiye ki meraa pativraty akhand rahe or teesraa yah ki mere bhagavatswarup pati ke atirikt or kahin bhi meri sakaam drushti na ho
 Those men who look at me with a poor vision may become impotent, impotent
 bhagwaan ne kaha ki chaar avasthaaen hoti hai-balya, comarya, yauvan or boodhaapa
 In these, work will be generated in people at the end of third stage or second phase
 tumhaari tapasya ke prabhaav se aaj maine yah maryaada bana di ki paidaa hote hi koi praani kamyukt nahin hoga
 In Triloki, there will be a reputation for your saintliness, and anyone who sees you with a positive view except your husband will become impotent instantly
 tumhaare pati bade bhagyavan, tapasvi, sundar or tumhaare saath hi saat kalpatak jivit rahanevaale honge
 You gave me the groom you asked for
 ab jo tumhaare man main baat he vah bataata hoon
 You had earlier pledged to sacrifice your body by burning in the fire, so here, on the banks of the river Chandrabhaga, Maharishi Medhatithi is doing a twelve-year yagya, go in there and fulfill your promise soon, go there in such a way that the monks cannot see you
 meri krupa se tum agindev kii putree ho jaaogi
 Whom you want to be a husband, while thinking about it with your mind, renounce your body
 yah kahkar bhagwaan ne apane karakamalon se sandhyaa ke sharir kaa sparsh kiya or turant hi uskaa sharir purodash ban gaya
 After this, the evening became invisible and went into that sacrificial fire
 bhagwaan kii krupa se us samay usne apane man main murtiman brahmacharya or tapascharya ke upadeshak vasishtha ko pati ke rup main varan kiya or unheen kaa chintan karte-karte apane purodashmay sharir ko agindev ko samarpit kar diya
 Agindeva burnt his body on the orders of God and entered it in Suryamandal
 surya ne uske sharir ke do bhaag karke apane rath par devtaa or pitaron kii prasannataa ke liye sthapit kar liya
 The upper part of his body which is the beginning of the day i

 gave
 iske pashchaat medhatithi ne yajna ke ant main us swarna ke samaan sundari sandhyaa ko putree ke rup main praapt kiya
 At that time, after bathing in the sacrificial water, filled with love and rejoicing, he took him in his lap and named him Arundhati
 arundhati chandrabhaga tat par sthit tapasarany naamak ashram main palane lagi
 Only on his debut in the fifth year did the entire tapasaraya become sacred with his virtues
 ek din arundhati chandrabhaga ke jal main snaan karke apane pita medhatithi ke paas hi khel rahi thi, swayan brahmaji padhaare or uske pita se kaha ki ab arundhati ko shiksha dene kaa samay aa gaya he, isaliye ise ab sati sadhvi striyon ke paas rakhkar shiksha dilvaani chaiye; kyonki kanya kii shiksha purushon dwaara nahin honi chaiye
 Only a woman can teach women; But you do not have any woman, so keep your daughter with Bahula and Savitri
 tumhaari kanya unke paas rahakar sheeghra hi mahagunavati ho jaaygi
 Medhatithi commanded him and upon his departure went to Suryaloka with Arundhati
 vahaan unhone suryamandal main sthit padmasanacin savitridevi kaa darshan kiya
 At that time, Bahula was going to the Manas mountain, so Savitridevi also left the sunrise and left for the same place
 baat yah thi ki pratidin vahaan savitri, gayatri, bahula, saraswati evam drupada ekatrit hokar dharmacharchaa karti thi or lok-kalyankari kaamana kiya karti thi
 Maharishi Medhatithi bowed separately to those mothers and after addressing everyone said that this is my Yashaswini girl
 yaheen iske upadesh kaa samay he
 That is why i have come here with this
 brahma ne aisi hi ajna kii he
 Now it will remain with you
 mata savitri or bahula aap donon ise aisi shiksha den ki yah sachharitra ho
 Both of them said- Maharshe! By the grace of Lord Vishnu your daughter has already become true; But due to the command of Brahma, we keep it with us
 yah purvajanm main brahma kii kanya thi
 It has become your daughter by your penance and by the grace of God
 arundhati kabhi savitri ke saath surya ke ghar jaati to kabhi bahula ke saath indra ke ghar jaati
 She became superior to her teacher Savitri and Bahula too after receiving the education of feminine
 ek din maanas parvat par vicharan karte-karte arundhati murtiman brahmacharya maharishi vasishtha ko dekha
 Rays of light were coming out of his mouth
 arundhati is rup par mugdh ho gai
 Jaganmata Savitri came to know about this
 iske baad medhatithi ne maharishi vasishtha se is kanya ko patni ke rup main sweekaar karne kaa nivedan kiya
 The streams which fell while taking bath by Brahma, Vishnu etc
 on the occasion of marriage became the seven rivers, such as Gomti, Saryu, Sipra, Mahanadi etc
, whose sight, touch, bath and drink have the welfare of the whole world
 
 vivaah ke pashchaat vasishthaji apni dharmapatni ke saath vimaan par savaar hokar devataaon ke batalaaye hue sthaan par chale gayi
 Wherever they are engaged in the welfare of the world by doing austerities in the form, then Arundhati serves them in a disguised manner

 Accepting Muhammad as the last messenger of Allah is one of the central beliefs of Islam
 Shahada is a basic Islamic practice that proclaims that Allah is One, and Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam is the apostle sent by Allah
 This declaration is subtly like this: "la Ilaha Ilallah Muhammadun Rasulullah" means "there are no Mabuds, except Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah"
 In passages such as 3: 132, 48:29 and 66: 1 in the Quran, Muhammad is called Rasul, Prophet, and the Quran asks people to follow them, allowing each person to attain the Hayat and finally the success

 In Medina, Hazrat Muhammad improved relations between the various existing communities
 The constitution of Madina specifying community relations was rewritten from Hazrat Muhammad's Salah, which led to the formation of an independent community, and the first Islamic state
 Was established In 630 AD, Muhammad Sah with his followers marched on Mecca, the people of Mecca were defeated in the war and Mecca came under the control of the Muslims
 Kaaba Sharif was declared a holy place of Islam
 In later years, Muhammad underwent several social and religious reforms , uniting the various Arab tribes under Islam
 Hazrat died in 632 AD, but by then almost all tribes of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam

 In the Quran, Muhammad is also referred to as "ahmad"
 The law of universal brotherhood and the principle of human equality, which you proclaim, is a reflection of the great contribution that Hazrat Muhammad made to the social upliftment of humanity

 In childhood, he was called by two names, his mother used to call him Muhammad and grandfather Abdul Muttalib called him Ahmed
 He was a member of the Banu Hashim clan, a respected branch of the prestigious and influential Qureshi tribe
 According to Islamic books, before the birth of Muhammad, his mother had seen many spasms, in which he was told about his godliness and spiritual significance
 One of them is the following: "ootiyat ummuhu fil manaami faki-l laha annaki ha-m-lat sayyidal aalami-na va kheral variyati fa-sammihu mohammadan ija va-ja-atahu satu hmdu biha0" Muhammad was orphaned at a young age
 a few months before the birth of Hazrat, Hazrat Abdullah left for Palestine and al-sham with a trading caravan
 Due to the difficult journey and illness, he stayed for rest in the last leg of the journey, the village of his paternal grandmother Salma Bint Amr, who was in Medina, and the convoy left him behind and left for Mecca City
 After receiving news of Abdullah's illness by the caravan, Hazrat Abdul Mutallib sent his elder son al-harit to Medina, but after leaving there al-harit learned that his brother had died a month after the illness
 , And was buried at darun-nabiya

 According to a custom, Allah’s Rasul has said that "I am the best speaking Arab, so i was born in Quraysh and grew up in Saad"
 | In Bani Saad, Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam spent the first five years of his life with his foster-mother Halima Saadia
