 Spencer developed an all-inclusive concept of origins as the gradual evolution of the physical world, biological organisms, the human mind, and human culture and societies
 As a polymath, he contributed to a wide range of subjects, including ethics, religion, humanities, economics, political theory, philosophy, biology, sociology and psychology

 As both a teenager and a young man, Spencer found it difficult to stabilize in any intellectual or professional field
 During the boom in the field of rail transport during the 1830s, he worked as a civil engineer and also spent most of his time writing provincial magazines, which were non-religious in their religion and in their politics

 Its publisher, John Chapman, introduced him to his seminar, which included many of the capital's most democratic and progressive thinkers, including John Stuart Mill, Harriet Martineau, George Henry Lewis and Mary Ann Evans, with whom he had a brief romantic engagement

 Spencer's next book, Principles of Psychology, published in 1855, discovered a physiological basis for psychology, his first reward from Evans and Lewis
 yah pustak in buniyadi manyataon par aadhaarit thi ki maanav man prakritik niyamon ke anusaar kaary karata he tathaa yah ki inhen saamaanya jeev-vigyaan ke dhaanche ke bheetar khoja ja saktaa tha
 This allowed an evolutionary approach to be adopted not only in terms of the individual, but also in terms of species and race
 Through this paradigm, Spencer's goal was Mill's logic's associative psychology, the notion that the human-mind was formed from molecular sensations held together by laws of associative thought, and that more 'scientific' seeming cranial science The theory, in which the core of specific mental functions was traced to different parts of the brain, was to reconcile
 spencer ne tark diya ki, ye donon siddhant satya kaa aanshik varnan karte the: vichaaron ke doharaavpurn saahchary mastishk ke utakon main vishisht reshon ke nirmaan main sammilit the, tathaa inhen prayog-uttaradhikaar kii lemarkwaadi kriyavidhi ke madhyam se ek se duusari peedi main bheja ja saktaa tha

 haalanki, yah pustak prarambh main safal nahin thi or iske pratham sanskaran kii antim 251 pratiyaan june 1861 tak nahin bik sakin
 Spencer's interest in psychology was derived from a more basic concern establishing the universality of natural law

 This was in contrast to the views of many theologians at the time, who insisted that parts of the composition, particularly the human soul, were outside the domain of scientific research
 comte kii sistim di philosophy positive prakritik niyam kii saarvbhaumikta ko pradarshit karne ke lakshya se likhi gai thi or apane lakshya kii purti ke liye spencer ko comte kaa anusaran karnaa tha
 However, Spencer did not agree with Comte's belief that it was possible to find a rule of universal application, which he discovered in progressive development and called the theory of evolution

 Spencer thought that this composition of ten sections would take twenty years to complete; In the end it took him twice as long and it took almost the entire duration of his long life

 Also noted were some notable retainers, such as the liberal pastor Arthur Stanley, Dean of Westminster; And guests like Charles Darwin and Hermann von Helmholtz were invited from time to time

 By the 1890s, his readers began to abandon him and many of his closest friends died and his mind was skeptical about the confident devotion to development that he had made his philosophical system central

 Although social statics was originally a creation of a democrat who believed in giving women the right to vote and in the nationalization of land to break the power of feudalism, by the 1880s, they were staunch women sufferers
 Had become adversaries and he collaborated with the Liberty and Property Defense League land owners in a common program against him Received, which they believe leaning toward "socialism" elements led by William Ewart Gladstone was largely against the opinions of Gladstone himself
 Spencer's political views of this period were expressed in The Man Versus the State, which has become his best work

 Spencer's philosophical system seemed to demonstrate that it was possible to believe in humanity's ultimate perfection based on advanced scientific concepts, such as the first law of thermodynamics and biological origins
 sankshep main, spencer kaa darshanik drushtikon devvaad or pratyakshvaad ke ek sangyojan se milakar bana tha
 On the one hand, he inherited some portions of eighteenth-century Devism from his father and other members of the Derby Philosophical Society, and from books such as George Combe's highly popular The Constitution of Man
 isamen vishwa ko sadbhaavpurn rachana vaala ek brahmad or prakruti ke niyamon ko ‘bhavathit rup se dayaalu’ mana gaya tha
 Natural laws were thus statues of the well-known universe, which were created by the Creator for the purpose of propagating human happiness
 haalanki spencer ne kishoravastha main hi apane isai mat kaa tyaag kar diya tha or baad main devatv kii kisi bhi ‘maanavarupi’ avadharana ko asweekaar kar diya, lekin iske baavjood ek lagbhag avchetan str par ve is avadharana ko dridhtaapurvak jakade hue the
 Although he owed much of the credit he gave to positivism, he had received much from it, especially in its creation of a philosophical system as the integration of various branches of scientific knowledge
 He was also following positivism in his insistence that it is possible to get only the real knowledge of facts and hence it was futile to speculate about the nature of the final truth
 pratyakshvaad or unke shesh devvaad ke bich yah tanaav kritrim darshanashasre kii puri pranali main bana rahaa
 Spencer followed Comte in aiming for the unification of scientific truth; In this sense, his philosophy was focused on being 'artificial'
 comte kii hi tarah, ve bhi prakritik niyam kii saarvbhaumikta ke prati patibaddh the, jiske anusaar prakruti ke niyam bina kisi apwaad ke jaivik kshetra par bhi utane hi lagu hote hai, jitne kii ajaev kshetra par or maanav ke man par bhi utane hi lagu hote hai, jitne ki shesh sristi par
 is prakaar kritrim darshanashasre kaa pehla uddeshy yah pradarshit karnaa tha ki prakritik niyamon ke rup main, brahmad ke sabhi tathyon ke vaigyanik anveshan ko khoj paane main sakasham hone ke liye koi bhi apwaad nahin he
 All of Spencer's works on biology, psychology, and sociology were intended to demonstrate the existence of natural laws in these specific areas
 yahaan tak ki naitikta par unke lekhan main bhi, unhone yah vichaar rakhaa ki nashvarata ke 'niyamon' ko khoj paanaa sambhav tha, jinamein niyamaatmak saamagree hone ke baavjood bhi jinaki avasthaa prakruti ke niyamon kii hi thi, yah ek aisi avadharana he, jiskaa mul combay ke constitution of main main dekha ja saktaa he
 The second purpose of Artificial Philosophy was to show that these same rules lead to development in a sustained way
 keval vaigyanik vidhi kii ekta par bal dene vaale comte ke vipareet, spencer ne sabhi prakritik niyamon ko ek buniyadi niyam, utpatti ke niyam, main vighatit karke vaigyanik gyaan ke ekikaran kaa prayaas kiya
 In this context, he followed the paradigm proposed by Edinburgh publisher Robert Chambers in his anonymous work Vestiges of Natural History of Creation
 haalanki aksar ise charles darwin kii da origin of spisis kaa ek prabhaavaheen agradoot kahkar khaarij kar diya jaataa he, lekin vastav main chembers kii pustak vigyaan ke ekikaran ke liye ek kaarykram thi, jiskaa lakshya yah darshana tha ki saura mandal kii utpatti ke liye laplas kii niharika pariklpana or lemark kaa prajati roopantaran kaa siddhant donon hi 'pragatisheel vikaas kaa ek adbhut samanyikaran' ke udhaaharan the
 Chambers was associated with Chapman's seminar and his work became an undisclosed mold for artificial philosophy
 spencer ke vikasvaadi drushtikon kii spasht abhivyakti pehali baar unke niabandh, 'progress: its lau and coz ' main hui, jo ki san 1857 main chapman ke westominster rivyuu main prakashit hua tha or jo baad main first principles of a new system of philasophy kaa aadhaar bana

 Spencer expressed the view that all the structures of the universe evolve from a simple, uniform, symmetry into a complex, different, variety and the process of large integration of different parts continues with it
 spencer kaa maananaa tha ki yah vikasvaadi prakriya puure brahmad main kaary karti hui dekhi ja sakati he
 It was a universal law, which was as much applicable to stars and galaxies, as much to biological beings and to the human social system as it was to the human mind
 It differed from scientific rules only by its general generality, and special science rules could be demonstrated as examples of this theory
 jatilta ke vikaas kii vyakhya karne kaa yah prayaas do varshon baad prakashit hui darwin kii origin of spisis main milane vaale prayaas se purnatah bhinn tha
 Quite often, incorrectly, it is believed that Spencer simply took over and normalized Darwin's work on natural selection
 However, even after reading Darwin's work, he introduced the phrase 'survival of the best' as his own vocabulary for Darwin's concept and is often mistakenly regarded as a theorist who used Darwinian theory Applied only to society, but still reluctantly included natural selection in their entire existing system prajati roopantaran kii unke dwaara pahachaani gai praathmik kaarividhi lemarkwaadi prayog-uttaradhikaar kii thi, jisane yah pratipaadit kiya ki ang prayog yaa apaprayog ke dwaara viksit athwa nasht hote hai or yah ki ye parinamit parivartan bhavi pidiyon main bhi sanchaarit ho sakate hai
 Spencer believed that this method of gradual development was also necessary to explain 'higher' gradual development, especially for the social development of humanity
 Furthermore, unlike Darwin, he believed that there was a direction and gradual point of gradual development, which is the final stage of the attainment of equivalence
 unhone jaivik kramik vikaas ke siddhant ko samajashasre par lagu karne kaa prayaas kiya
 He propounded that society is the result of a change from lower to higher forms, just as it is said that according to the theory of biological evolution, the lowest forms of life develop into proper forms
 spencer kaa daawa tha ki isi prakaar maanav kaa man bhi nimnatar pashuon kii saral swachaalit pratikriyaaon se lekar vichaarsheel manushya main tark-shakti kii prakriya tak kramik rup se viksit hua tha
 According to Spencer, there were two types of knowledge: knowledge acquired by the individual and knowledge acquired by the species
 Intuition, or unconsciously learned knowledge, was the hereditary experience of the species
 spencer ne bahut utsaah ke saath auguste comte ke mul pratyakshvaadi samajashasre kaa adhyayan kiya
 Comte, a philosopher of science, had proposed a theory of socio-cultural gradual development, according to which the development of society takes place through a general rule of three stages
 haalanki, jeev-vigyaan main vibhinn parivartanon ke baad likhte hue, spencer ne comte ke pratyakshvaad ke vichaaratmak pahaluon ko khaarij karte hue saamaajik vigyaan ko kramik vikaas ke jeev-vigyaan ke sandarbh main punarnirupit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Broadly, Spencer's sociology can be described as socially Darwinist
 spencer ne tark diya ki samaaj kaa vikaas saral, samaan, samarupata se jatil, bhinn, vividhta tak ke kramik vikaas kaa udhaaharan he
 He developed a theory of two types of society, terrorist and industrial, which was in line with gradual evolutionary progress
 aatankwaadi samaaj, jisaki sanrachana padanukram or ajnapaalan ke sambandhon se milakar bani thi, saral or ek samaan tha; audyogic samaaj, jo ki svaichhik, sanvidatmak rup se sweekrut saamaajik dayitvon par aadhaarit tha, jatil or bhinn tha
 Society, which Spencer considered a 'social animal', evolved gradually from a simpler state to a more complex one according to the universal law of evolution
 iske alaava, audyogic samaaj soshal statics main viksit adarsh samaaj kaa pratyaksh vanshaj tha, haalanki spencer ne ab is baat ko spasht rup se vyakt nahin kiya ki kya samaaj kaa parinaam araajaktaavaad ke rup main milegaa yaa kya yah rajya kii ek nirantar bhoomika ko suchit karata he, haalanki ek aisi bhoomika, jo ki sanvidaaon ke pravartan or bahya suraksha ke nunatam kaaryon tak simit ho chuki hogi
 Although Spencer made some valuable contributions to early sociology, not less than his influence on structural pragmatism, his attempt to present Lamarckist or Darwinian ideas in the field of social science failed
 Even some people considered it to be actively dangerous
 Interpreters of the time, such as Wilhelm Dilthey, became the promoters of the distinction between natural sciences and human sciences
 In the 1890s, Emil Darkhim established formal academic sociology, with a strong emphasis on applied social research
 beesvin sadi ke mode par, german samajashasreiyon kii pehali peedi, sarvaadhik ullekhneey rup se maiks webar, ne vidhiparak apratyakshvaad ko prastut kiya tha
 As predicted in Spencer's first book, the creation of the 'ideal man in an ideal society' would be the last point of the process of gradual development, in which humans would have fully embraced social life
 The main difference between Spencer's early and later concepts in terms of this process was the time-scale of the gradual development involved
 manovaigyanik-or atah naitik bhi-sanrachana, jo ki hamaare purvajon dwaara vartmaan peedi ko viraasat main di gai he, tathaa jo aage ham apni bhavi pidiyon ko denge, samaaj main nivas kii aavashyaktaaon ko kramik rup se apanaae jane kii prakriya main thi
 For example, aggression was an intuition associated with survival, which necessitated the primary conditions of life, but it became unnecessary to adopt it in advanced societies
 Since human intuition had a special place in the fibers of brain tissue, it was subject to the Lamarckian methodology of experiment-succession, so that gradual changes could be transferred to future generations
 With the passage of several generations, the process of gradual development will ensure that humans become less aggressive and incrementally altruistic, eventually resulting in the creation of an entire society in which no one will hurt another person
 haalanki kramik vikaas ke dwaara ek purna vyakti kaa nirmaan karne ke liye yah aavashyak tha ki vartmaan or bhavi peediyaan apane vyavhaar ke 'swaabhaavik' parinaamon kaa anubhav karen
 keval isi tareeke se vyaktiyon ko aatm-sudhaar kaa kaary karne or is prakaar apane uttaradhikariyon ko ek unnat naitik gathan pradaan karne ke liye aavashyak prerana praapt hogi
 atah vyavhaar ke 'swaabhaavik' sambandh or iske parinaam ke bich vyavdhaan utpann karne vaali kisi bhi baat ko roka janaa chaiye or isamen garibi mitaane, saarvajanik shiksha pradaan karne, yaa anivaary tikaakaran ko aavashyak banane kii rajya kii pratirodhi shakti kaa prayog bhi shaamil tha
 Although charitable donations were to be encouraged, they were also to be limited by the idea that human beings often receive sorrows as a result of their actions
 atah vyaktiyon kaa 'ayogy garibon' kii ore nirdeshit atyadhik paropkaarita vyavhaar or parinaam ke bich us kadi ko tod degi, jise spencer is baat ko sunishchit karne ke liye buniyadi aavashyaktaa maanate the ki vikaas ke ucchtar str par maanavtaa kaa kramik vikaas jari rahe
 Spencer adopted a utilitarian standard of ultimate value — the greatest happiness of the greatest number — and according to him the climax of the process of evolution would be the greatest assessment of utility
 People living in an ideal society will not only get pleasure from the practice of synonyms, but they will also try to avoid causing misery to others
 They will also instinctively respect the rights of others, as a result of which the principle of justice will be adhered to globally - each person will have the maximum amount of freedom, consistent with the same amount of freedom that others receive
 'freedom' refers to the absence of coercion and is intimately tied to the right to private property
 spencer ne aacharan ke is niyam ko 'param nitishasre' kaha, jisane niti-shasr kii ek vaigyanik aadhaar vaali pranali pradaan kii, jo ateet kii aloukikta-aadhaarit niti-shasr pranaaliyon kaa sthaan le sakegi
 haalanki, unhone is baat ko sweekaar kiya ki hamaare dwaara viraasat main praapt kiya gaya naitik gathan abhi hamen param nitishasre ke niyamon ke saath purna anurupata se vyavhaar karne kii anumati nahin detaa or yahi kaaran he ki hamen 'saapeksh nitishasre' ke ek niyam kii aavashyaktaa he, jisamen hamaari vartmaan apurnataa ke vikrutisheel karkon par bhi vichaar kiya gaya ho
 Spencer's distinctive approach to musicology was also linked to his ethics
 spencer ne sochaa ki sangeet kaa udgam joshpurna vaktrutv kala main dhundha ja saktaa he
 The speaker exerts affirmative effect, not only by the rationality of his words, but also by his accent and accentuation — as Spencer expressed it, the musical qualities of his vowel act as "commentary of emotion on sentences of intelligence
" We do
 sangeet, jise vaktruta kii unki visheshta kaa ek unnat vikaas mana gaya, prajatiyon kii niti-shasr kii shiksha or vikaas main yogadan detaa he
 "the bizarre ability of us to be influenced by melodies and rhythms, perhaps, lies in both the fact that it is within the possibilities of our nature to realize those immense pleasures, and that in some way or the other they are Are related
 yadi aisa he, to sangeet kii shakti or arth bodhgamy ban jate hai; lekin anyathaa ve ek rahasy hai
 " spencer ke antim varshon main unka praarambhik ashavad ko nasht hota hua dikhaai diya or iskaa sthaan maanav ke bhavishya ke prati ek nirashavad ne le liya
 Despite this, he devoted most of his efforts to support his arguments and prevent misinterpretation of his important theory of non-interference
 victorian logon ke bich spencer kii pratishtha kaa bahut bada shrey unke agyeyavaad ko he
 He rejected theology as a representative of 'atheism of those who pretend piety'
 His rejection of the traditional religion earned him immense maladjustment and was often condemned by religious thinkers accusing him of being an advocate of atheism and materialism
 Nevertheless, unlike Huxley, whose agnosticism was a concentrated terrorist sect toward 'an unforgivable sin of faith', Spencer emphasized that they did not seek to devalue religion in the name of science, but rather the harmony between the two Were worried about setting up
 spencer kaa tark tha ki ham chaahe dharmik vishwaas se prarambh karen yaa vigyaan se, antat hamen kuch anivaary, lekin shabdic rup se kalpanaateet dharanaon ko sweekaar karnaa hi padataa he
 Whether we are concerned about a manufacturer or the ground level, which lies beneath our experience of facts, we cannot draw a blueprint for its concept

 But Acharya Shankar wanted to stay away from the mess of householder
 ek jyotishi ne janm-patri dekhakar bataaya bhi tha ki alpaayu main inaki mrityu kaa yoga he
 Knowing this, Acharya Shankar's spirit of public service had become strong by taking retirement
 sanyas ke liye unhone maan se hath kiya or balak shankar ne 7 varsh kii aayu main sanyas grahan kar liya
 Then to get the highest goal of life, he got out of the house with permission from the mother

 Acharya gets excited for a moment after listening to Sevika

 When he got angry and asked Chandal to move away, Chandal said- 'O Muni! You are neglecting a divine being who is in the body, therefore you are a Abraham
 atev mere maarg se aap hat jaayen
 Acharya Shankar, listening to Chandaval's devani, was very impressed and said - "you have given me knowledge, so you have become my guru
" ’ yah kahkar acharya shankar ne unhen pranaam kiya to chandal ke sthaan par shiv tathaa chaar devon ke unhen darshan hue
 During a few days stay in Kashi, he went to meet Acharya Mandan Mishra in the city of Mahishmati
 acharya mishra ke ghar jo paaltu maina thi vah bhi veda mantron kaa uccharan karti thi
 Acharya Shankar went to Mishraji's house and defeated him in scripture
 pati acharya mishra ko harata dekh patni acharya shankar se boleen- ‘mahatman! abhi aapane aadhe hi ang ko jeeta he
 Only by defeating me with your tips will you be called victorious
 ’ Then Bharti, the wife of Mishraji, started questioning Kamasastra

 Many disciples took initiation from him
 iske baad ve dharm kaa prachaar karne lage

 Once he was going to Manikarnika Ghat with his disciples to bathe in a very narrow street in Brahma Muhurta
 raste main ek yuvati apane mrit pati kaa sir god main liye vilaap karti hui baithi thi
 The disciples of Acharya Shankar prayed to the woman to remove her husband's body and give it a way, but the woman continued to cry by ignoring him
 tab swayan acharya ne usase vah shav hataane kaa anurodh kiya
 Hearing his request, the woman said- 'O sannyasin! You are repeatedly asking me to remove this body
 aap is shav ko hi hat jane ke liye kyon nahin kehete?’ yah sunakar acharya bole- ‘he devi! aap shok main kadaachit yah bhi bhul gai ki shav main swayan hatane kii shakti hi nahin he
 'the woman immediately replied-' Mahatma, in your eyes, Brahm, the absolute power, is the doer of the world
 phir shakti ke bina yah shav kyon nahin hat saktaa?’ us stri kaa aisa gambhir, gyaanamay, rahasypurna vaakya sunakar acharya vahiin baith gaye
 He found a tomb
 ant:chakshu main unhone dekha- sarvatra aadyashakti mahamaya lila vilaap kar rahi hai
 His heart was filled with inexplicable joy and the wordy word of maternal veneration from the mouth burst into stotra
 ab acharya shankar aise mahaasaagar ban gaye, jisamen advaitvaad, shuddhadvaitvaad, vishishta dwaitvaad, nirgun brahm gyaan ke saath sagun saakaar kii bhakthi kii dharaayen ek saath hiloren lene lageen
 He realized that the divine, nirguna on the advaita land of knowledge is the formless brahm, the same is true on the land of dvaita
 unhone nirgun or sagun donon kaa samarthan karke nirgun tak pahunchne ke liye sagun kii upasna ko aprihaary seedhi mana
 On the meeting ground of knowledge and devotion, it was also realized that knowledge is the ultimate achievement of all spiritual practices
 unhone ‘brahman satyam jaganmithyaa’ kaa udghosh bhi kiya or shiv, parvati, ganesh, vishnu aadi ke bhakthiraspurn stotra bhi rache, ‘soundarya lahari’, ‘vivek chudamani’ jaise shreshthatam granthon kii rachana kii

 Bahadur Shah Zafar was the last emperor of the Mughal Empire in India and a noted poet of Urdu
 unhone 1857 kaa pratham bhartiya swatantraaa sangram main bhartiya sipaahiyon kaa netritv kiya
 After the defeat in the war, the British sent him to Burma where he died
 jafar kaa janm 24 aktubar, 1775 main hua tha
 His father was Akbar Shah II and mother Lalbai
 apane pita kii mrityu ke baad jafar ko 18 sitambar, 1837 main mughal badshaah banaaya gaya
 It was a matter of fact that by that time the Sultanate of Delhi had become very weak and the Mughal emperor had remained a nominal emperor
 bharat ke pratham swatantraaa sangram main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane kii jafar ko baari keemat bhi chukaani padi thi
 His sons and great-grandchildren were publicly roasted by the British authorities
 yahi nahin, unhen bandi banaakar rangoon le jaaya gaya, jahaan unhone saat november, 1862 main ek bandi ke rup main dam todaa
 He was buried near the Shvedagon Pagoda in Rangoon
 unke dafan sthal ko ab bahadur shah jafar dargah ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Even today, when a patriotic person travels to the then Burma, he does not forget to pay tribute to Zafar's tomb
 logon ke dil main unke liye kitna sammaan tha uskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki hindustan main jahaan kai jagah sadakon kaa naam unke naam par rakhaa gaya he, vahiin pakistan ke lahore shahar main bhi unke naam par ek sadak kaa naam rakhaa gaya he
 Victoria Park in Old Dhaka city of Bangladesh has been renamed Bahadur Shah Zafar Park
 1857 main jab hindustan kii aazaadee kii chingaari bhadki to sabhi vidrohi sainikon or raja-maharaajaaon ne unhen hindustan kaa samraat mana or unke netritv main angrejon kii eent se eent baja di
 Bahadur Shah Zafar also got angry after seeing the rebellion of Indian soldiers against the British and called for the British to be driven out of India
 bharatiyon ne dilli or desh ke anya hisson main angrejon ko kadi shikast di
 Initial results favored the Indian warriors, but later, due to the deception of the British, the stand of the first freedom struggle changed and the British managed to suppress the rebellion
 bahadur shah jafar ne humayun ke makbare main sharan lee, lekin major hads ne unhen unke bete mirza mughal or khijar sultan va pote abu bakar ke saath pakad liya
 The British crossed all limits of oppression
 jab bahadur shah jafar ko bhukh lagi to angrej unke saamne thali main paroskar unke beton ke sir le aae
 He replied to the British that the sons of India sacrifice their heads for the country and come to their father in the same manner
 aazaadee ke liye hui baghawat ko puri tarah khatm karne ke makasad se angrejon ne antim mughal badshaah ko desh se nirvasit kar rangoon bhej diya
 Bahadur Shah Zafar was not only a patriotic Mughal emperor but also a famous Urdu poet
 unhone bahut si mashhoor urdu kavitaayen likhin, jinamein se kaaphi angrejon ke khilaaf baghawat ke samay machi uthal-puthal ke dauraan kho gai yaa nasht ho gai
 The lines written by him in Urdu are also very famous - ,,, Ek aisa ghar chahiye mujh Ko jiski faza mastana Ho Ek kone mein ghazal ki mahfil Ek kone mein maykhana Ho
 ,,, desh se baahar rangoon main bhi unki urdu kavitaaon kaa jalawaa jari rahaa
 He was always worried about India there
 unki antim ichha thi ki vah apane jivan kii antim saans hindustan main hi len or vahiin unhen dafnaaya jaae lekin aisa nahin ho paaya
 i do not think that my desolation is in love, what is made of alam-e-naapidar bulbul ko bagbaan se na saiyaad se gilaa,kismat main kaid likhi thi fasal-e-bahaar main
 Tell them to settle somewhere else from these haunts, where is this place in dil-e-daagdar
 ek shaakh gul pe baith ke bulbul he shaadamaan,kaante bicha die hai dil-e-laal-e-zaar main
 Age-a-drawer had brought four days of demand, two were cut in the beginning, two were waiting
 din zindagi khatm hue shaam ho gai,failaa ke paanv soyenge kunj-e-mazaar main
 How much is it for unfortunate 'zafar' dafn, two gaz zameen not found in ku-e-yaar bahadur shah jafar jaise kam hi shaasha hote hai jo apane desh ko mahabuuba kii tarah mohabbat karte hai or ku-e-yaar main jagah na mil paane kii kasak ke saath pardes main dam tod dete hai
 This was the basic difference with the fundamental Indian ideology which considers its country as its mother
 badshaah jafar ne jab rangoon main karawas ke dauraan apni aakhri saans lee to shaayad unke labon par apni hi mashhoor ghazal kaa yah sher jarur rahaa hoga- "kitna he badanaseeb jafar dafn ke liye, do gaj jameen bhi na mili ku-e-yaar main
 " bharat ke pratham swatantraaa sangram main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane vaale antim mughal badshaah bahadur shah jafar urdu ke ek bade shaayar ke rup main bhi vikhyath hai
 His poetry was filled with patriotism rather than sentimental poets and this was the reason that he warned the British rulers to walk to Shamsheer of Hindustan till the planks-london
 janashrutiyon ke anusaar pratham swatantraaa sangram ke baad jab badshaah jafar ko giraftaar kiya gaya to urdu jaanane vaale ek angrej sainya adhikari ne un par kataaksh karte hue yah sher kaha- "dam main dam nahin, ab khayr maango jaan kii e jafar ab myaan ho chuki he, shamsheer hindustan kii

!!" is par jafar ne karaara jawaab dete hue kaha tha- "hindio main bu rahegi jab talak imaan kii, takhte landan tak chalegi teg hindustan kii

!!" Zafar, called the last emperor of the Mughal period in India, was made the emperor of Delhi during the First War of Independence
 badshaah banate hi unhone jo chand aadesh die, unamem se ek tha gohatya par roak lagaana

 gorakhpur vishvavidhyalay main itihaas ke purv praadhyaapak dow shailanath chaturvedi ke anusaar 1857 ke samay bahadur shah jafar ek aisi badi hasti the, jinka badshaah ke taur par hi nahin ek dharmanirpeksh vyakti ke rup main bhi sabhi sammaan karte the
 That is why it was very natural that the soldiers who reached Delhi after revolting from Meerut made Bahadur Shah Zafar their king first
 chaturvedi ne baatcheet main kaha ki jafar ko badshaah bananaa sankethik rup se british shaskaon ko ek sandesh tha
 Under this, the Indian soldiers wanted to give the message that the Indian ruler would be in power at the center of India, not foreign
 badshaah banane ke baad bahadur shah jafar ne gohatya par pabandi kaa jo aadesh diya tha vah koi nayaa aadesh nahin tha
 Rather, Akbar had given similar orders during his reign
 jafar ne mahaj is aadesh kaa paalan phir se karwaanaa shuru kar diya tha
 Another aspect of Zafar's personality was poetry, along with Deshprem
 unhone na keval gaalib, daag, momin or jock jaise urdu ke bade shaayaron ko tamaam tarah se protsaahan diya, balki vah swayan ek achche shaayar the

 Others Others: farsi shabd daravish pracheen utpatti kaa he or proto-irani shabd se nikalataa he jo avestan main drugu- "zaruuratmand" ke rup main madhya farsi driosh ke madhyam se dikhaai detaa he
 The word Iranian is probably a cognate with the Vedic Sanskrit word Adrigu-, a symbol of uncertain meaning on many deities
 vaidic shabd kaa shaayad ek-drigu ke rup main vishleshan kiya janaa he, yah " drigu nahin ", shaayad "garib nahin", yani "amir" he
 The existence of this Vedic cognate suggests that the institution of the Holy Epidemic was predominant among ancient indo-iranian peoples because it has historically been later in Iran as a disgusting brotherhood and also in India in various schools such as the Saints Of haalanki, aadhunik farsi bhashaa ke drushtikon se shabd kii vyutpatti spasht nahin he, samakaleen shabdon ke sandarbh main or sufik rahasyamay avadharanaon ke sandarbh main shabd ke hisson ko samajhane yogya banane kaa prayaas kiya gaya he
 Late word spelled as dar before 1964, meaning "door" in Persian; Darvesh has been interpreted as "one that goes from door to door"
 farsi shabd kuch bhashaaon main "tapasvi" ke liye bhi shabd detaa he, jaise urdu vaakyansh "darveshaneh tabiyat", "ek aparivartaneey yaa tapasvi swabhaav" ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Bundahishan darvish or daravesh means "one who leads to many doors"
 yah shabd der yaa dar or visheshan rup or vish yaa vesh ويش yaa وش vish kii rachana he, or iskaa arth he "koi jo daravaaje se daravaaje jaataa he, geet gaata he, paise paata he, or logon ko jagata he"
 The word is old in Persian, but it is Vash Zalmanian or Zalman in the indo-iranian language of Pashto, meaning "awakened youth"

 kalil yaa colide ek rasaynic mishran hota he jisame ek vastu duusari vastu me samaan rup se parikshepit hoti he
 The particles of the dispersed object remain suspended only in the mixture and not as a solution
 aisa isliye hota he kyonki kalil me kanon kaa aakaar vilyan me upasthit kanon ke aakaar se bada hota he - yah kan itane chote hote hai ki mishran me puri tarah parikshepit ho kar ek samroop mishran taiyaar karen, lekin itane bade bhi nahin hote hai ki prakaash ko prakirnit karen or naa ghulein
 Due to this reflection, some of the solutes look like solution
 kisi kalil pranali kii do pruthak pravasthaayen hoti hai: pehali parikshepan pravastha or duusari satat pravastha 
 a particle system can be solid, fluid or gaseous
 neeche kii talika me ek samroop or asamroop mishran me kalil ke kanon kaa vyas kaa tulanaatmak vishleshan he
 : isliye, kalileey nilamban, samroop or asamroop mishranon ke madhyavarti hote hai
 The word colloid is used in English for Kalil
 yah shabd greek bhashaa ke cola shabd se bana he jiskaa arth 'sares' hota he
 In 1861, an English scientist, Thomas Graham, observed that albumin, glue, glue, demand, silicic acid, and other similar substances were not able to filter through the pores of the bio-membrane when dissolved in water
 iske vipareet sharkara, uria, sodium, chloride ityadi ke jalavilayan jaev jhilli ke chhidron se nikal jate hai
 The former type is found in most of the amorphous form on the basis of this property
 Soluble substances in water are divided into two classes: those substances which were crystalline and after solution in water can be released from the pores of the bio-membranes
 , Called crystalloids, and others, which were amorphous and could not be able to come out of the pores of the bio-membrane when dissolved in water, were called kalil
 kintu ab yah siddh ho gaya ki sharkara or sodium chloride aadi crystalia padaarth bhi upyukt madhyam main kalil ke rup main praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 In the foliage, the fissile particles are scattered in a continuous medium
 is prakaar kalilon main do sanghatak rahete hai
 In the list below, first name is of medium and second name is of distributed substance: kalilkanon kaa aakaar vishesh mahatvapurn he
 The particles are larger in size than molecules, but they are smaller in size than all particles that can be seen under a microscope

 Although the copies of each mail in the above list can be obtained, there are more types of types used and these have been studied in more detail
 jal ke madhyam main vitarit thos yaa drav ke kalil ko saul kaha jaataa he
 Both organic and inorganic substances are found in many forms in the mumps
 vaigyanik yaa pravidhik, kadachit hi koi aisi shakha ho jisamen kalilon kaa mahatvapurn upyog na hota ho
 Due to its superiority, science has become especially special
 kalilon ke gunon main bhed hone kii drushti se unhen do pradhan virgon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 The first class has metallic types of plumes, such as gold plumes etc
, and the second class has protein types of plumes, such as gelatin
 inke vishesh gun nimnlikhit hai : The words which have special use for both these types of plumes are hydrologist and water lover
 inhen angreji main krmanusaar lyophobic or lyophilic bhi kaha jaataa he
 This classification cannot be said to be entirely satisfactory, since some properties of certain clades are intermediate to the unreduced properties of both extreme classes
 is prakaar ke jalakalilon main kuch dhatviya oxiden yaa hydroxiden, kuch aviley fasphet, molibdet, tungstate ityadi hai
 Some people divide the Kalils into two classes of Alambabh and Payasabha
 inke atirikt kalilon kaa ek teesraa varg bhi he jo ab vishesh mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 This class is called the Kaliyala Vidyutulasi

 When a skin is sent through the center of the waterway by focusing the beam, the beam becomes milky and the outgoing rays acquire fluidity
 iske kaaran hai kalilkanon ke aakaar or prakaash ke tarangadairghy main samanta tathaa vitarit padaarth ke vartanaank or prakaash ke tarangadairghy main samanta tathaa viparit padaarth ke vartanaank kaa avichhinn madhyam ke vartanaank se adhik hona
 With the help of powerful microscopes, the talcus can be seen by the effect of the Tyndall
 is prakaar dekhe jane par kalilkan prakashit taron kii bhanti dikhaai padate hai
 Also their speed is quick, irregular and continuous

 For many technical methods, it is necessary to create a color
 jalasantrasi kalil hi saralata se banaae ja sakate hai, kyonki jalpremi kalil utkramntic hai
 There are several methods used to construct the drainage systems
 in vidhiyon ko do virgon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he– ekikaran or vighatan
 In the first method, molecularly sized particles are gradually elongated until they attain the size of the buds, and their acceleration is accelerated by the presence of a stabilizing material, or by the addition of a water-soluble particle, Is controlled
 is vidhi se kai dhaatuen, hydraxiden, aviley lavan tathaa photography main kaam aanevaali rajat helliden kalilavastha main nirmit kii gai hai
 In the second method, larger particles are divided into smaller particles
 bradig vidhi main dhaatuon ke bade tukdon ko vidyut arq kii sahaayta se todakar dhatviya kalil praapt kiye jate hai
 For this reason this method is called the method of dissolution, but in reality these buds are also made by the method of integration
 arq ke ucch taap par dhaatu vashpikrut ho jaati he
 Then the superfluous particles of vapor get integrated and form the shape of the particles
 vastav main vibhaajan dwaara kalil banane kaa pramukh saadhan kalil-mil he
 In this device, two plates, which are very close to each other, rotate in opposite directions
 vitarit kiya janevaala padaarth uchit madhyam ke saath in donon platon ke bich se bheja jaataa he
 In this way, the particles become smaller and take the shape of darker particles
 donon main se kisi bhi vidhi se nirmit kalilon ke shodhan ke liye unhen manibhabh padaarth se apohan dwaara pruthak kriya jaataa he
 To do this Kalil is placed in a parchment or cellophane bag
 is jhole ko ab shuddh vilaayak main rakh diya jaataa he
 This solvent is the only medium of the bud
 vaidyut apohan se shodhan adhik purna or shghri sampann kiya ja saktaa he
 Water-loving urns are extremely permanent and inert to small quantities of electrodynamics
 inkaa sthayitv unki madhyam main vileyata ke kaaran hota he
 The outer surface of these calculus is covered with molecules of medium
 is prakaar bahyatal kii mukt urja naganya rahati he
 This makes these particles unable to grow in size
 iske atirikt yah dekha gaya he ki jalpremi kalil madhyam kaa antartaleey tanaav kam kar dete hai
 Stability of the buds is also controlled by this effect
 jalasantrasi kalilon kaa sthayitv kalilkanon par sthit aavesh ke kaaran hota he
 The charge on the outer plane of the calculus is created by the ions absorbed by them
 kisi vidyudvishleshya ke milaane par kalilkanon ke tal par aavesh ksheen ho jaataa he or dhire-dhire aisi sthiti aa jaati he jab vidyudvishleshya kii nimnatam sandratha par kalilkanon kaa tal ekikaran kii shaktiyon kaa virodh kar paane main asamarth ho jaataa he
 Thus the lowest concentration of electrodynamics, which is capable of depositing a certain amount of a particle, is called the precipitation value of the particle
 saadhaarant: vidyudvishleshya ke us aayan kii sanyojaktaa, jo kalilkaran ke aavesh ke vipareet ho, jitani hi adhik hoti he, vidyudvishleshya kii avakshepan shakti bhi utani hi adhik prabal hoti he
 Hydrographic tubes are added to them to keep them safe from hydrodynamics
 is vidhi ko sangrakshan vidhi kehete hai
 Swarnakalil can be degraded with a small amount of gelatin, but a high amount of this protein gives stability to this bud
 jigmondi ke anusaar kisi kalil sangrakshak kaa swarnmaan kalil sangrakshak ke milligraamon kii vah sankhya he jisaki upasthiti main swarna ke 10 ghan centimetre pramanik kalil ko sodium chloride ke aise 1ghan sein
me
 vilyan dwaara, jiskaa sandran 10 pratishat ho, avakshipt kiya ja sake
 The conservation of Kalil is of special importance and has been practiced since ancient times
 yah pehle hi kaha ja chukaa he ki kalil kanon par aavesh rahata he
 Simple absorption experiments can be done to find the type of charge on the cell
 dhanatmak kalil silica jelly dwaara or rinatmak kalil aluminium hydraksaide dwaara avashoshit kar liye jate hai
 Charge is important for the stability of the hydrologist Kalil
 aavesh kaa prakaar padaarth ke bhautik swabhaav par or kalil ko sthayitv pradaan karanevaale vidyudvishleshya par nirbhar rahata he
 For example, if the silver iodide sol is charged, the type of charge on it can be both positive or negative
 yadi kalil main rajat nitrate kaa sookshm aadhiky hua to saul dhanatmak hoga
 Conversely, if excess of potassium iodide occurs, the sol will become negative
 yah dekha gaya he ki dhanatmak rajat aayan ke abhimaanya adhishoshan ke kaaran rajat iodide kalil kaa aavesh dhanatmak or iodide ke rinatmak aayan ke adhishoshan ke kaaran is kalil kaa aavesh rinatmak ho jaataa he
 The amount and potential of charge on the ground floor are measured by money-electrocution
 saul ko you nalee main bharaa jaataa he jisamen do platinum ke vidyudagr rahete hai
 Now Daish Vidyuthara flows in Saul
 yadi kan dhanagar kii ore badhate hai to unpar rinatmak vidyut aavesh rahata he
 This type of motion of particles in the electric field is called money-power-transmission
 yah gati upyukt prakaashiya vidhiyon dwaara suvidhapurvak maapi ja sakati he
 The voltage can be calculated by measuring the velocity
 is vibhav ko saadhaarant: vaidyut-gatyaatmak-vibhav kaha jaataa he
 This electromagnetic potential is also seen when the electromagnetic solution is sent through a collimated diluent
 do anya sambandhit kriyaaon par bhi anusandhan kiye gaye hai
 These are current potential and precipitation potential
 vaidyuthik gatyaatmak vibhav narnst vidyut rasinic vibhav se bhinn he
 It is now proved that the electrochemical chemical potential is the voltage that lies between the distributed art and the main volume of the delivery medium
 vaidyuthik-gatyaatmak vibhav vah vibhav he jo us vitarit kala se sanlagn dwik tal ke sthir bhaag main vitaran madhyam ke mukhya aaytan ke bich hota he
 The real nature of the bicameral attached to distributed art is still a matter of imagination
 phir bhi yah gyaat kar liya gaya he ki vaidyut-gatyaatmak-vibhav upasthit yanon se vishesh prabhavit hota he
 There is ample evidence that the laws of gas fit well with the solutions
 kisi kalil kii rasakarshan daab kii gananaa neeche likhe sameekaran dwaara kii ja sakati he: Where: ab chunki rasakarshan daab kan ke aakaar kaa pratilomanupati hota he isse yah spasht ho jaataa he ki kalil kii rasakarshan daab kam honi chahie or vitaran kii maatra ke aadhiky ke saath inaki maatra bhi badhani chahie
 In this way, generally the impulse pressure of the rings is low and when the pressure is high, it is mainly due to impurities
 rasakarshan daab kaa maapan ardhapargamya jhilli kii sahaayta se kiya jaataa he
 The uneven distribution of electrosynthesis leads to complexity in some buds due to an action called dononsantulation
 is tanupat santulan kii kriya kaa adhyayan congou red naamak rang, sabun tathaa anya kai kalileey vidyudvishleshyon par kiya gaya he
 In these conditions the collicular substance behaves like an electrodynamic
 jab kisi aayan kaa aakaar kalilkanon ke aakaar ke samaan hota he jab tanupat ke donon ore vibhav kaa srijan hota he, jise tanupat vibhav kehete hai
 In many protein cells, dilution-potential always arises and charge on living cells is due to this equilibrium balance
 ati sookshmdarshi dwaara dekhne se kalilkanon kaa aakaar yaa rup nahin dekha ja saktaa
 Nevertheless the number of calculus can be counted; The average volume of a particle can then be determined by the value of the absolute volume of the distributed matter
 kintu jab saul nirmaan kiya jaataa he tab usamen kai aakaar ke kan upasthit rahete hai
 The form of the calculus can be spherical, lanceolate, elliptical or flaky
 kalilkanon kaa rup gyaat karne ke liye kai vidhiyaan viksit kii gai hai jo prakaashiya gunon par aadhaarit hai
 These plumes are characterized by having an impact on the viscosity of the delivery medium
 shyanta adhiktar bad jaati he or vitarit padaarth kii maatra kii vruddhi ke saath shghrita se badhati jaati he
 Viscosity increases so much when a particular concentration is reached that Kalil takes the form of jelly
 saul ke avakshepan se bhi jelly praapt kii ja sakati he
 The use of jelly is limited and the semipermeable gels that are made by cooling the gelatine, agar agar, starch, etc
 are called jelly
 adhikansh jalpremi kalil sheetaleekaran par yaa garm karne par jelly banaate hai
 Many inorganic hydrological plants can also be obtained as jelly under special conditions
 is prakaar se kai jaleey hydraxidon, aviley faspheton, molibdeton kii jeliyaan prayogshaala main banaai jaati hai
 The jelly generally exhibits the properties of liquid release
 adhik samay tak rakhane par jelly sikudti tathaa chatak jaati he or jelly main bandhaa hua jal baahar nikal aata he
 Jails can be divided into two classes: elastic and rigid
 pratyasth jeliyaan saadhaarant: gelatin, aighar aadi prakritik kalilon se banati hai, kintu adhikansh acarbonic jeliyaan, jinamein silisik amla bhi rahata he, drudh vyavhaar dikhaati hai
 Some jails have a strange nature
 ve hilaane par, andolit karne par yaa karnathit tarangon ke prabhaav se pun: saul main parivartit ho jaati hai
 But if they are kept stable then they become jelly again
 yah kriya kai baar duharai ja sakati he
 This action is called tactile sense
 jalpremi kalilon main proteinon ke saulon par vishesh khojein hui hai
 The reason for this is their importance in physical chemistry
 proteinon ke jo saul prakritik avasthaa main paae jate hai ve saadhaarant: rinatmak aveshwale hote hai
 Most solutes achieve positive charge when made acidic
 is prakaar ek vishesh pi ech par protein ke saul par koi bhi aavesh nahin hoga
 This is called isocele point
 isi se protein kii pahchaan haati he
 The chemical properties are ancient amphoteric because it has more bona fides
 is gun ke kaaran protein bafar kaa kaam detaa he
 This quality has special significance in the life of animals
 proteinon main jalasantrasi kalilon ko sthayitv pradaan karne kaa samarthy rahata he or inaki swarnsankhya kii sahaayta se kai rogon ke nidaan main sahaayta milti he
 It is not possible to calculate all the uses of the plants
 adhikansh jaivik taral padaarth, jaise rakt aadi, swabhaav ke hote hai
 As calcium-soap, metals such as calcium, gold, iron, gold, manganese, silver, etc
, or their insoluble compounds, are used in medicine in the form of kalil
 aahaar vigyaan main kalileey padaarthon par vichaar karnaa padataa he
 The humic and clayey soil properties have a special effect on soil fertility and its physical properties
 reshe carbonic kalil hai or kapadaa udyog bhi kalileey udyog hi he
 The color and printing used in the manufacture of chintz is done only because of the color properties
 kuch abhikaarakon main celulosiya padaarth ke kalileey gunon par kritrim resham kaa nirmaan aadhaarit he
 Soaps and detergents are the waste materials and many substances, such as lubricants, plastics, rubber, lubricants, oily dyes, etc
, are found to have scleenic properties
 kaanch, mrittika tathaa cement udyog kalileey vigyaan se vishesh rup se sambhddha hai
 Most of our diets, such as proteins, carbohydrate fats in the form of starch, etc
 are also lax in properties
 kalil rasayan kii takanic hamaare anek bhojya padaarth banane main aavashyak hoti he jaise pavaroti, makkhan, jelly, jam, peya, icecream aadi

 Like every sequence defined by linear rotation, the Fibonacci number has a whole-formula solution
 It is known as the Binet Sutra, although he was previously known as Abraham de Moivre: 
 Fibonacci Repatriation svarnim anupaat ke nirdharak sameekaran ke samaan nimnatah he Which is known as the productive polynomial of alternation
 uparyukt sameekaran kaa koi mul x 2 = x + 1, { \ displaystyle { \ begin{matrix}x^{2}=x+1, \ end{matrix}} \ ,} kaa samaadhaan karata he or x n − 1 { \ displaystyle x^{n-1} \ ,} dwaara guna karne se nimna darshata he: By definition φ { \ displaystyle \ varphi \ ,}, is the root of the equation and the second root is 1 - φ = - 1 / φ
 { \ displaystyle 1- \ varphi \ , = - 1 / \ varphi \ ,
}
 So: or Both φ n { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^ {n}} and n = n { \ displaystyle ^ {n} = ^ {n}} are geometric series that solve the Fibonacci alternation
 The first series expands exponentially; The second, exponentially, with alternating signs, leads to zero
 Since the Fibonacci alternation is linear, any linear combination of these two series can also solve the alternation
 These linear combinations create a two-dimensional linear vector difference; The original Fibonacci sequence can be found in this difference
 raikhik sanyojanon kii shrinkhlaayein φ n { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^{n}} or n { \ displaystyle ^{n}}, a tathaa b gunankon sahit, nimna dwaara paribhaashit kii ja sakati hai All the series defined in this way satisfy the Fibonacci alternation
 jahaan apeksha he ki f a, b = 0 { \ displaystyle F_{a,b}=0} or f a, b = 1 { \ displaystyle F_{a,b}=1} pratifal a = 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle a=1 / { \ sqrt {5}}} or b = − 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle b=-1 / { \ sqrt {5}}} dete hai, jiske parinamswaroop vahi binet sutara miltaa he, jisase hamane shuru kiya tha
 yah darshaya gaya he ki yah sutara fibonachi prayaavartan kii purti karata he
 iske alaava, ek suspasht jaanch kii ja sakati he: And aagaman ke mul prashnon siddh karte hue, pramanit karte hai ki Therefore, for any two initial values, the combination a, b { \ displaystyle a, b} can be found such that the functions f a, b { \ displaystyle F_ {a, b} \ ,}, are accurate to the sequence

 iske alaava, agar p ≠ 5 ek visham abhajya sankhya he, to: Examples of all cases: visham n ke liye, f n ke sabhi visham abhajya bhaajak hai ≡ 1, jo yah suchit karte hai ki f n ke sabhi visham bhaajak hai ≡ 1 
 for example, f 1 = 1, f 3 = 2, f 5 = 5, f 7 = 13, f 9 = 34 = 2×17, f 11 = 89, f 13 = 233, f 15 = 610 = 2×5×61 ∑ k = nn + 9 f k = 11 f n + 6 { \ displaystyle \ sum _ {k = n} ^ {n + 9} F_ {k} = 11F_ {n + 6}} udhaaharan ke liye, let n = 1: f 1 + f 2 + 


 + f 10 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 = 143 = 11 × 13n = 2: F2 + F3 +

+F9 = 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 = 88 = 11×8n = −1: f − 1 + F0 + 


 + F8 = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 = 55 = 11 × 5n = −2: F−2+F−1+F0+


+F7 = −1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 = 33 = 11×3 It can be easily seen that if the units of the Fibonacci sequence take mod n, then the resulting sequence with at most n 2 rotations must be iterative
