 Open source software has a different relationship with intellectual property rights, so its importance cannot be denied
 ho saktaa he ki aane vaale kal main, soochna prodyogiki kii disha isi par nirbhar kare
 That is why it is absolutely necessary to know open source software, understand its importance, and assimilate the relationship with it and intellectual property rights
 aap yah bhi na sonche ki open sorce software keval computer vaigyanikon ke liye he par aam vyakti ke liye nahin he
 It could have been fine a few years ago, but not today
 main koi computer vaigyanik nahin hum par mere computer main koi bhi malikana software nahin he
 In today's open source software, doing all the work done in the office, writing, going to the internet, giving different types of powerpoint presentation, listening to songs, watching dvds, blogging, or anything else that we all want to do Is as simple as proprietary software
 The best thing is that there is no problem of intellectual property rights and there is no question of committing the common man to spend money and theft of software
 is lekh ko samajhane ke liye kamputer gyaan kii aavashyaktaa nahin he yah lekh vastav main aam vyakti ke liye he
 With open source software, it wants to draw your attention to the legal issues related to it, which we are not paying attention to, lest it should be too late when we think of attention
 So if you are not related to computer science, then you should not think that this article is not for you
 aap yah bhi na sonche ki yah aapke samaj main nahin aayegaa| main computer par kaam to karata hum par computer vaigyanik nahin hum, na hi mujhe computer ke bare main koi jaankaree he
 There is nothing in this article that a common person cannot understand
 yah yahaan dekhen See it here free software ke liye paisa nahin liya ja saktaa he
 If there is no money for the software, then how will it work? The merchant class then felt that free software was useless and they kept it far away from them
 haalanki free software se bhi paisa kamaaya ja saktaa he lekin uskaa tarika kuch alag he, parantu free software par kuch aisa thappa lag gaya ki vyapaaree varg un duusare tareekon ko bhi apnaane se dur rahane lage
 In 1997, enthusiasts in free software held a meeting in San Francisco and formed a public corporation called Open Source Initiative
 isamen 10 maarg darshak siddhant banaaye gayi

 It also has its own logo which includes OSI software
 'S logo is printed which means that it is open source software
 kuch lokapriy opensorce software nimna hai- 1
 Operating system is software which brings the hardware of a computer and runs a computer
 There are mainly three types of operating systems
 vindos kii tarah ke: yah duniya main sabase zyada lokapriy he Like Unix: There are many types of operating systems, the most popular of these is Linux
 iskaa graphical interphes vindos kii tarah kaa he parantu donon main takanic kii bhinnata he
 Mac / aus Kind of: The personal computer was started from these and it is the easiest to run
 apane desh main to nahin, par baahar ke deshon main zyada lokapriy he
 Barkley Unix is a form of Unix
 mike system main barchlay unics kaa kaaphi yogadan he

-2 bahut acha aaparating system hone ke baad kyon nahin chalaa tathaa mike bhi itnaa aasaan aaparating system hone ke baad bhi vindos kii tarah kyon nahin lokapriy he
 We will discuss this in detail sometime, but only now that most of the forms of Unix are open source software
 linaks open sorce saftware he or ji
pi
el

 Solaris is also a Unix-based operating system
 yah pehle san mikro-system kaa malikana saftver tha par janvari 2005 se yah open sorce saftware ho gaya he or CDDL ke andargat prakashit kiya gaya he
 2
 Firefox, Thunderbird and Sunbird are software foundations of Mozilla Foundation
 yah mauzila pblic license ke andar prakashit he
 It runs on both Linux and Windows
 Firefox is a web browser like Internet Explorer
 thanderbard, outluk express kii tarah i-mail bhejne va paane ke liye saftware he
 Sunbird is an e-manager similar to Microsoftoft Outlook

 Open office

 It runs on both Windows and Linux
 yah microsoft auphis main banaaye gayi alag-alag tarah ke formet ke dastavejon, prastutikaran ko khol saktaa he tathaa usee formet main surakshit kar saktaa he
 5
 Apache: This is the most popular software for web servers
 yadi aap vindos main kaam karte hai tathaa linaks par jane kii baat sochate hai to aap open aphis daat aurg, firefox, thanderbard, sanbird or jimp par kaam karke dekhen| When we are talking about open source software, then let us talk about the three acronyms that are used in this regard
 FOSS / FLOSS: free software, open sorce software he par har open sorce software, free software nahin he
 GPL for free software Must be published under license, but open source software can also be published under many other types of licenses
 donon main antar to he par sambandh bhi gaharaa he
 All this has started with free software, so such software is called Free Open Source Software or FOSS for short
 yahaan free shabd kaa arth swatantraaa se he par free shabd kaa arth bina paise ke bhi hota he isaliye free shabd kaa prayog kuch chakkar main daal detaa he
 There are two different words in the French language Gratis which means Libre without money which means freedom, so people often use Free / Libre Open Source Software or FLOSS
 LAMP: open sorce software ke chaar mukhya stambh hai: linuxappachemysqlpython, Perl, PHP ityadi Linux and Apache have already been discussed
 mysql ek data-base prabandh karne kaa program he
 Python, Perl, PHP, etc
 are computer languages for scripting and writing programs
 aane vaala kal ho saktaa he ki isi LAMP se ujjwalit ho isaliye open sorce software ko kinare na kijiye, dhyaan main rakhiye| Linus Torvalds, who is the originator of Linux, has written his biography with David Diamond
 iskaa naam he 'just for Fun: the Story of an Accidental Revolutionary’| yah bahut acchhee pustak he tathaa ise padhne se jivan main aage badhane kii prerana milti he vah is pustak main open sorce software ke bare main kehete hai, 'the GPL and open source model allows for the creation of the best technology
 


 It also prevents the hoarding of technology and ensures that anyone with interest will not be excluded from its development
 


so open source would rather use the legal weapon of copyright as an invitation to join in the fun, rather than as a weapon against others
 It’s still the same old mantra: Make Love, Not War, except on a slightly more abstract level
 


 Imagine an intellectual property law that actually took other people's rights into account, too
 Imagine IP laws that encouraged openness and sharing
 Laws that say sure, you can still have your secrets, whether they be technological or religious, but that does not mandate legal protection for such secrecy
 ' jab ham log baat open software main kuch phaayde ke bare main kar rahe he to bahut acha hoga ki kuch doosraa paksh bhi dekhen| bill gates, vindos ke janmdata hai
 He has written the book 'the Road Ahead'
 yah pustak bhi bahut acchhee he
 According to its name, it tells which side of information technology will go in future
 Many difficult questions are explained very easily in this
 isamen ve free software kii kamiyon ko is tarah se varnan karte hai, 'in addition to free information, there's a lot of free software on the Internet today, some of it quite useful
 Sometimes it's commercial software given away as part of a marketing campaign
 Other times the software has been written as a graduate student project or at a government-funded lab
 But i think consumer desire for quality, support, and comprehensiveness in important software applications means that the demand for commercial software will continue to grow
 Already many of the students and faculty members who wrote free software at their universities are busy writing business plans for start-up companies that will provide commercial versions of their software with more features, not to mention customer support and maintenance
 ' yah to kahana mushkil he ki software udyog kis taraf jaayegaa parantu duniya ke bahut saare desh tathaa vyapaar gharaane open sorce software ko apana hissaa bana rahe hai
 We are currently at a crossroads and are in a position to give a new twist to information technology

 yah naam alfred vegener ke mahadwipiya pravaah ke siddhant kii vaigyanik charchaa main gadha gaya tha
 In his book, "the Origin of Continents and Oceans", he considered that all continents were part of a vast continent at one time, which he called "the continent", before subsequently disintegrating and flowing to their present places

 The exact configuration and geodynamics history of Rodinia is not as well understood as that of Panotia and Pangea
 When the fragmentation of Rodinia occurred, it was divided into three pieces: the vast continent of proto-lauresia, the vast continent of proto-gondwana, and relatively Small Congo Cretan
 proto-lauresia and proto-gondwanaland were separated by the proto-tethys Ocean
 proto-loresia ke swayan vibhajit hokar alag-alag hone ke turant baad laurenshia, siberia or baltic mahadwipon kaa nirmaan hua
 Its rift also created two new oceans, the Iapetus Ocean and the Paleocean Ocean
 baltic laurenshia ke purv main or siberia laurenshia ke uttar-purv main sthit tha
 Around 600 ma, most of these oceans came back together to form Panotia, a relatively short giant continent consisting of a large amount of land near the poles and just a relatively small strip connecting the polar oceans near the equator
 isaki utpatti ke keval 60 million varsh ke baad, lagbhag 540 eme, cambrian yug kii shuruyaat ke kareeb panotia phir se vikhandit ho gaya jisase laurenshia, baltic or gondvanaa ke dakshini vishaal mahadweep kaa janm hua
 In the Cambrian period, the independent continent of Laurentia, which became North America, became located on the equator with delimited oceans bounded on three sides: the Panthalassic Ocean to the north and west, the Ipitus Ocean to the south and the Khanty Ocean to the east
 Around 480 MA in the oldest Ordovician, the small continent of Avalonia, a part of land that formed the northeastern United States, Nova Scotia, and England, was liberated from Gondwana and began its journey towards Laurentia
 baltic, laurenshia or evalonia sabhi ordovisian kaal ke ant tak ek saath mil gaye or is tarah ipitas mahaasaagar ke nikat ek chote mahadweep kaa nirmaan hua jise uramerica yaa loresia kaha gaya
 The North Appalachians also originated as a result of the collision
 Siberia is located near Euramerica with the Khanty Ocean between the two continents
 jab ye sabhi ghatnaayen ho rahi thim, gondvanaa dhire-dhire dakshini dhruv kii ore khisak gaya
 This was the first phase of Pangea's origin

 Avalonia had not yet collided with Laurentia, and a remnant of the Ipitus Ocean, a sea route between them, was still shrinking as Avalonia slowly slid towards Laurentia

 The Khanty Ocean, a branch of the Ipitus Ocean, was also shrinking from Siberia as an island island that collided with the eastern Baltic
 is dweepiya vrutt ke peeche ek nayaa sagar, ural mahaasaagar maujuud tha
 Towards the end of the Silurian period North and South China moved away from Gondwana and began to move northward across the shrinking proto-tethys Ocean, with the new paleo-tethys Ocean opening at its southern tip
 devonian kaal main gondvanaa swayan uramerica kii ore badhane laga tha jiske kaaran rek mahaasaagar sikud rahaa tha
 In the early Carboniferous era, northwest Africa touched the southeastern coast of Euramerica, starting to form the Appalachian Mountains and the southern parts of the Meseta Mountains

 North China and Southern China were located on independent continents
 chota mahadweep kazakhstania madhya carbonipheras yug main siberia se takaraa gaya tha
 Western Kazakhstania collided with the Baltic at the end of the Carboniferous Era, causing them to cease contact with the Ural Ocean and causing them to originate in the western proto-tethys Ural mountains and the vast continent Lauresia
 This was the last stage of Pangea's origin
 is bich dakshini america dakshini laurenshia se takaraa gaya tha jisase rek mahaasaagar kaa rasta band ho gaya tha or epalachiyans evam auchita parvaton ke sabase dakshini hisse kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 By this time Gondwana was located near the South Pole and glaciers were formed in Antarctica, India, Australia, South Africa, and South America
 uttari china kaa hissaa carbonipheras yug ke ant tak siberia se takaraa gaya tha or is tarah proto-tethis mahaasaagar puri tarah se band ho gaya tha
 At the beginning of the Permian era, the Cimmerian Plate split off from Gondwana and began to move towards Lauresia, creating a new ocean, the Tethys Ocean at its southern tip, and closing the path to the plato-tethys Ocean
 zyaadaatar bhu-bhaag abhi bhi ekikrut hi tha
 In the Triassic period, Pangea moved slightly in the southwest direction
 cimerian plate ab bhi sikudte peleo-tethis ke paar ja rahi thi jo jurassic kaal ke madhya tak jari rahaa
 peleo-tethis pashchim se purv tak band ho gaya tha or is tarah cimerian orogeni kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 Pangea looked like the letter "C" in English, which contained an ocean, the new Tethys Ocean, inside the Sea
 jurassic kaal ke madhya tak panzia main daraar pad gayi thi, iske vikhandan kaa vivaran neeche diya gaya he
 Fossil-evidence of Pangea includes the presence of similar and integral species found on continents that have now gone far
 udhaaharan ke liye, therapcid listrosoras ke jeevashm dakshin africa, bharat or australia main glosopteris flora ke sadasyon ke saath-saath paae jate hai jinka vistaar dhruviya vrutt se lekar bumadhya rekha tak hua hoga, agar mahadweep apni vartmaan sthitiyon main rahe honge; isi tarah mithe pani ke sarisrup mizosoras keval brazil or pashchimi africa ke taton ke sthaneey kshetron main paae jate hai
 Additional evidence of Pangea is found in the geology of the adjacent continents, including the matching of geological trends between the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa
 carbonipheras kaal ke dhruviya barf kii parat ne panzia ke dakshini chor ko dhank liya tha
 Especially glacial collections and structures dating back to the same era are found on many different continents that may have been together in the Pangea continent
 dhruviya vichlan ke spasht margon kaa peleomagnetic adhyayan vishaal-mahadweep ke siddhant kaa bhi samarthan karata he
 Geologists can determine the movement of continental plates by examining the orientation of magnetic minerals in rocks; When rocks are formed, they absorb the magnetic properties of the Earth and indicate in which direction the poles are present relative to the rock
 chunki aavarti dhruvon kii ore chumbakeey dhruvon kaa jhukaav keval kuch hajaar varshon kii avadhi main hota he, ek spasht ausat dhruviya sthiti nirdhaarit karne ke liye kai hajaar varshon ke kai lava se maapan kaa ausat nikaala jaataa he
 Samples of sedimentary rocks and intrusive igneous rocks have a magnetic tilt which is usually an average of these 'similar shifts' in magnetic northward tilt as their magnetic fields do not immediately form as in the frosting lava
 Happens in the case

 The components of the true polarity deviation are the same for all samples and can be eliminated

 The continuity of mountain ranges also provide evidence for Pangea
 iskaa ek udhaaharan epalchian parvat shrinkhalaa he jo purvottar sanyukt rajya america se lekar ireland, britain, greenland or scandinavia ke calladonids tak faili hui he
 Pangea had three major phases of fragmentation
 pehla charan praarambhik-madhya jurassic kaal main shuru hua tha jab panzia purv main tethis mahaasaagar se or pashchim main prashanth mahaasaagar se alag hona shuru hua, jisase antat vishaal mahadwipon loresia or gondvanaa kaa vikaas hua
 The rift that began to form between North America and Africa gave rise to many failed cracks
 a rift resulted in the creation of a new ocean, the North Atlantic Ocean
 atlantic mahaasaagar ek samaan rup se nahin khulaa tha; uttar-madhya atlantic main daraar bananaa shuru hua tha
 The South Atlantic did not open until the Cretaceous
 loresia ne dakshinavart main ghoomana shuru kar diya tha, yah uttar main uttar america evam dakshin main uresia kii ore bad gaya
 The path of the Tethys Ocean was also closed due to the rise of Lauresia in a clockwise direction
 isi bich africa ke duusari taraf purvi africa, antarctic or madagascar ke nikatavarti hashiyon ke saath ek nayaa daraar bhi bananaa shuru ho gaya tha jisase dakshin-pashchimi hind mahaasaagar kii utpatti hui, yah bhi criteshas main khul rahaa tha
 The second important phase of the fragmentation of Pangea began in the early Cretaceous period, when the small giant continent Gondwana split into several continents
 lagbhag 200 eme main simriya mahadweep upar varnit ke anusaar uresia se takaraa gaya 
 haalanki simriya ke takaraane ke saath hi ek sabadakshan kshetra nirmit ho gaya tha
 This subduction zone was called the Tethyan Trench
 yah samudri khai sambhawatah tethian mid-oshan rij ke rup main upashakhit ho gaya tha, yah rij tethis mahaasaagar ke vistaar ke liye jimmedaar tha
 This probably caused the northward movement of Africa, India and Australia
 praarambhik kriteshs kaal main atlantic jo aaj kaa dakshin america or africa he, antat purvi gondvanaa se alag ho gaya tha jisase "dakshin bhartiya mahaasaagar" kaa rasta khul gaya tha
 In the Middle Cretaceous period, Gondwana disintegrated and opened the way to the South Atlantic Ocean as South America began to move away from Africa to the west
 dakshin atlantic ek samaan rup se viksit nahin hua tha; balki yah uttar se dakshin kii ore daraar ke rup main bana tha
 Also Madagascar and India began to break away from the Antarctic at the same time and move northward, opening the way to the Indian Ocean
 madagascar or bharat criteshas kaal ke ant main 100-90 eme main ek duusare se alag ho gaye the

 'rawal' was a title given to the priest or Rajguru, the best scholar among the Brahmins
 yah padavi rajasthan ke sirohi jile main basane vaale brahmanon ko di jaati thi
 Later, he started adopting his surname caste 'rawal' and later called 'rawal Brahmin'
 sirohi ,paali tathaa jalor main based rawal brahaman samaaj ek swatantra samooh he jaati nahin he
 In the Brahmin castes of India, a group called Rawal Brahman is neither mentioned in Jati Bhaskar nor is there any such mention in the Brahmins Uttapati Martand, but from the depths it is known that when the establishment of Saraneshwarji after Shri Sthal
 It was then that the Brahmins who passed from Siddhpur went to a village called Gol which is presently near Sirohi and there was a Jagiri rate which in time Gorwal Brahman One group of the same group called Gautama gotra became Rawal Brahmin as the focal point of the group which is commonly called Vadakiya
 usee prakaar siddhapura se padhaare brahamanon ke ek varg ko jise harishchandra ke putr rohit ke naam se vikhyath rohitpur main basaaya gaya jo kalantar main rodwal brahaman kahalaaye uname se ek samooh kaa rawal brahaman samudaay main vilinikaran ho gaya jinhen krishnatraiya ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Similarly, the Kashyapa gotra brothers from Pali area merged into the Raval community, which was later called Lurkiya, Shanai: Kapil Tilua and other advanced Brahmin gotras got merged in this community which later became a separate identity called Raval Brahman
 rawal brahaman naamak jaati kaa ullekh kahi bhi nahin miltaa he parantu rawal shabd atak kaa ghotak he rawal se taatpary he rajyakul raja ke guru ko rawal kehete he
 Similarly, from the Sirohi royal family, it was received as Rawal title and also as many villages were received as Jagiri, so it is right here that rawal shabd padavi kaa ghotak rahane ke kaaran ek varg ne inhen pruthak rup de diya jo kalantar main rawal brahman naam se pruthak pahchaan ban gai
 But in all this, the Vadakiya group became the first citizen of Rawal Brahmin group, this is reflected here which came as the priest of Lord Saraneshwarji

 sadak rosh kaa aashay ek vaahan yaa anya motor vaahan ke chaalak ke aakraamak yaa cruddh vyavhaar se he
 Such rude behavior may include gestures, verbal insults, intentional driving in an unsafe manner or threatening driving, or posing a threat
 sadak par rosh vyakt karnaa vaad-vivaadon, hamalon or muthbhedo kaa kaaran banataa he jiskaa parinaam chot or yahaan tak ki mrityu bhi ho sakati he
 This can be thought of as the climax of an aggressive driving
 yah shabd kii utpatti 1980 ke dashak ke dauraan sanyukt rajya america main vishesh rup se los angeles, california main ek sthaneey tivi stesan KTLA par samachar-vaachakon dwaara hui
 The term originated during 1987–1988 where indiscriminate freeway shooting occurred at 405, 110, and 10 friezes in Los Angeles
 shooting kii ye gatividhiyaan apane sadasyon ko AAA motor club se is baat par pratikriya paidaa karaati he ki sadak par rosh vyakt karnaa yaa aakraamak yuktiyon or bhaavon ke driver ke saath kaisaa vyavhaar karnaa he
 The following are common expressions of expressing anger on the road: america main AAA foundation adhyayan ke anusaar 300 se adhik sadak par rosh vyakt karne ke maamalon kaa parinaam gambhir chot or yahaan tak ki maut bhi rahaa he - prati varsh 1200 ghatnaon kaa record he or chah saal ke adhyayan ke anusaar yah vaarshik rup se bad rahaa he jisaki jaanch police rashtriya str par karti he
 In some jurisdictions there can be legal differences between "expressing fury on the road" and "aggressive driving"
 america main, kuch rajyon ne hi vishesh aakraamak driving kanoon adhiniyamit kiye he, jahaan sadak par rosh vyakt karne jaise maamalon main - prati varsh lagbhag 1200 - par saamaanya rup se hamalaa or bydaree, yaa "sawari sambandhi manushya hatya" ke mukademe chalaaye jate hai
 Already since 1997, physicians in the United States were working to certify road rage as a medical condition
 yah maansik vikaar ke naidanik or sankhyikee minial main pehle se hi ek pramanik maansik vikaar he
 According to an article published by the Associated Press in June 2006, the behavior usually associated with expressing road rage is the result of an explosive disorder caused by innings
 yah nishkarsh 2001 or 2003 ke bich rajya america main kuch 9200 vayaskon ke sanyukt surveykshan dwaara liya gaya tha or yah maansik swasthya ke rashtriya santhaan dwaara vitt poshit hua he
 The reason for the explosive disorder caused by the innings has not been written to date
 "sadak par rosh vyakt karnaa" ek maansik samasya he yaa nahin, is baat par bhinn vichaar rahe hai
 There are many alternative solutions to overcome this obstacle, whether it is or not
 sadak par rosh vyakt karnaa apekshaakrit ek gambhir kaary he: ise janata kii suraksha ke liye khatre ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 However, investigation of intent by external observation is not always possible so "road razors" who are caught by police are charged with other offenses such as careless or inattentive driving
 
 kuch nyaayalayon jaise varjeenia kaa america rashtramandal main, sadak par rosh vyakt karne par aakraamak driving ke bajaay laaparvaah driving ke rup main mukadmaa chalaanaa aasaan he kyonki saboot ke boj ke kaaran safaltaapurvak doshi siddh karne ke liye "aashay" kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 It is likely that those who result in serious injury or death during "expressing fury on the road" events will suffer more severe penalties than simple negligence applied to similar consequences
 april 2007 main, ek colorado driver ko november 2005 main do vaahan chaalkon kii maut ke parinamswaroop pehle darje kii hatya kaa doshi qaraar diya gaya
 He will inevitably undergo two consecutive life terms
 chaudaa america rajyon ne aakraamak driving ke khilaaf kanoon paarit kar die he
 Only one state, California, has given it a special meaning to express indignation on the street, turning it into a legal term for art
 haalanki yah dhyaan dene yogya baat nahin he ki varjeenia main aakraamak driving ko laaparvaah driving kii tulana main ek kam aparaadh ke rup main sajaa di gayi he
 Expressing street fury in New Zealand is still technically legal and is still considered socially acceptable behavior
 kanoon kii samiksha ke liye kol ke baavjood bhi, newjiland sarkaar kaa australia jaise anya deshon kii tarah "sadak par rosh vyakt karne ke virdohi" kanoon prastut karne kii koi naveenatam yojana nahin he
 Although technically "chasing" motorists and willfully damaging their vehicles is a crime, the police generally do not consider such acts as a 'high priority' and called it an "insurance thing"
 It means that if a passenger has intentionally damaged his / her vehicle in the event of expressing anger on a road, then it is a case of insurance companies of both the parties rather than criminal cases
 Do depends on A
 So what will they solve it have short road rage in New Zealand is still legal and the police ignore such acts unless that person is killed
 america ke sabase bade mahanagareey kshetra ke ek 2007 adhyayan ke nishkarsh niklaa he ki miami, finnics, neuyork, los angeles or boston aise desh he jahaan vinamr driveron kii sankhya bahut kam he

 In such a situation, Subhash had to migrate to Tokyo and it is said that he died in an air crash

 Of course, Subhash was an extreme nationalist

 khoj suvidhaon ko ek shithil sangathit or alpakaalik sanchaar upkaran se ek mahatvapurn strot jaankaree main yuzanet ko parivartit kiya
 The relative durability of this collection and the ability of the author to search for the message together raised concerns about privacy and confirmed previously repeated warnings that one should be careful about in his or others' discussion

 Also, Google recognizes the "-" Usenet signature delimiter and finally removes the critical space

 In these groups, users could ask questions about the relevant Google service
 prayek aadhikarik samooh main ek google pratinidhi hota he jo kabhi-kabhi prashnon kaa jawaab detaa he
 Google representatives always have a blue g symbol in their surname
 kuch aadhikarik samoohon main shaamil hai: In addition to the group and forum, Google currently has a product idea to provide feedback on some of their products including the Google Group new preview UI: saath hi google unke google frends or google pej creatre apadats meling list ke aayojan ke liye google grups kaa bhi istemaal karti he, jo ki keval-ghoshit samooh he jahaan keval sabhapati post kar sakate hai
