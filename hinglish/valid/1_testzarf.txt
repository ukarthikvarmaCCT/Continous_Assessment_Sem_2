 The spiritual aspirant uses one or all of his three powers to establish unity with God
 premashkti ke prayog kaa naam bhaktiyog, chintanashkti ke prayog kaa gyanayog tathaa karm shakti ke prayog kaa naam karmyog he
 It is through these that final unity with God is established
 isamen andeh nahin ki virashaivon ke bhi mandir, tirthasthan aadi vaise hi hote hai jaise anya sampradaayon ke, antar keval un devi devataaon main hota he jinaki puja kii jaati he

 The use of "over-inflated" revenues, distorted by Enron in marking innovation, high growth and great commercial performance, was more important than lending debt

 For financial reporting purposes, a series of rules dictate whether a special purpose entity is a separate entity of the sponsor
 In total, by 2001, Enron used hundreds of special purpose entities to conceal its debt

 Although Enron's compensation and performance management system was designed to retain and reward its most valuable employees, the system was established to contribute to a dysfunctional corporate short-term income to maximize bonuses
 But i was enamored by just throwing light on it

 The company was constantly focusing on its share price

 In budget meetings, Skilling used to develop targeted earnings by asking "how much revenue do you need to keep our stock price up?" And that number was used, though not possible

 Risk management was important not only for Enron because of its regulatory environment, but also because of its business plan

 As such, Enron effectively entered rescue operations with him

 The Board of Directors was aware of these practices but did not take any action to stop Enron from using them
 The board was given a brief account of the purpose and nature of the transactions of Whitewing, LJM and the Raptors, explicitly approving them and receiving updates on their actions
 board ko keval enron kii vyapak of da-books gatividhi kii hi acchhee tarah se jaankaree nahin thi, balki board ke sankalpon ke madhyam se ise sambhav bhi banaaya gaya tha
 Even though Enron was running a derivative business, it seems that the Finance Committee and most commonly the board members did not have sufficient ability to understand derivatives and evaluate what they were told

 In 2000, Arthur Andersen earned $ 25 million in audit fees and $ 27 million in consulting fees
 The auditors' methods were questioned as to whether they were carrying out disputed incentives or lacked the expertise to adequately assess the financial complexities enforced by Enron
 enron ne kai pramanit lok lekhaakaar ke saath-saath kuch aise lekhaakaaron ko kaam par rakhaa jinhone vittiya lekha maanak board ke saath vikasshil lekha niyamon par kaam kiya tha
 Accountants looked for new ways to save the company's money, including capitalizing on the flaws found in accounting industry standards, generally accepted accounting principles
 enron ke ek lekhaakaar ne rahasyodghatan kiya "hamalogon ne apane laabh ke liye is vidya kaa khub jorshor se istemaal karne kaa prayaas kiya
 All these opportunities came from all its rules
 We had understood where the mistake was happening because we had found that weakness
 " Anderson's auditors were pressurized by Enron's management to delay the determination of fees for special purpose entities so that their debt risk was eliminated
 Since the entities never returned profits, the accounting guidelines required that Enron should be revoked, where the value of the institution was removed from the balance sheet at a loss
 enron kii aamadani kii ummiido ko puraa karne ke liye anderson par dabaav daalkar, enron kabhi-kabhi arnst and yang yaa pricewaterhousakupers lekha pratishthanon ko anderson ko pratisthapit karne ke liye ek nae pratishthan ko kaam par rakhane kaa bhram paidaa karne ke liye lekha kaaryon ko puraa karne kii anumati detaa tha
 Although Andersen was equipped with internal controls to protect against the struggling incentives of local partners, they failed to prevent conflict of interest
 In one case, Anderson's Houston office, which handled Enron's audit, was able to pass a judgment against any critical review of Enron's accounting decisions by Anderson's Chicago partner
 iske atirikt, jab enron kii esaisi jaanch kii khabar ko janata ke saamne laayaa gaya to anderson ne kai ton sahaayak dastavejon ke tukade-tukade karke or lagbhag 30,000 i-mail or computer filon ko delit karke apane lekha pareekshan main kisi bhi tarah kii koi laaparvaahee ko chhipaane kaa prayaas kiya
 Disclosures in the context of Anderson's overall performance led to the separation of the establishment, and the Powers Committee presented the following assessment: "the evidence we find shows that Anderson has not disclosed his audit of Enron's financial statements or related party transactions
 In relation to its obligation to inform Enron's board about Enron's internal contracts, its professional responsibilities Did not meet not
 " Corporate audit committees usually only meet briefly during the year and their members have only a modest background in accounting and finance
 enron kii lekha pareekshan samiti ke paas kai samitiyon kii tulana main adhik visheshgyata thi
 This included: enron kii lekha pareekshan samitiyaan aamtaur par bahut kam samay ke liye baithak karti thim jinamein kai muddon par vichaar-vimarsh kiya jaataa tha
 In a meeting on 12 February 2001, the committee met for only one hour and 25 minutes
 Enron's audit committee did not have the technical know-how to properly question auditors on accounting issues related to the company's special purpose entities
 kaaphi dabaav main hone kii vajah se yah samiti company ke prabandhan se bhi sawaal karne asamarth thi
 The report of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs accused board members of allowing conflicts of interest to hinder their actions while supervising the company's accounting practices
 enron ke patan ke samay lekha pareekshan samiti ke hit sangharsh par andeh kiya gaya tha
 Enron had made a habit of reserving the cost of canceled projects as assets, with the argument that none of the official letters stated that the project had been canceled
 is vidhi ko "snobal" ke rup main janaa jaataa tha or haalanki shuru main yah tay kiya gaya tha ki snobal 90 million dollar ke bheetar hi rahata he, isliye ise baad main badhaakar 200 million dollar kar diya gaya
 In 1998, when analysts visited the Enron Energy Services office, they were impressed by how fast employees were working
 hakeekat main, skilling ne yah dikhaane ke liye anya vibhaagon se karmchaariyon ko is karyaalay main sthanantarit kar diya tha ki yah prabhaav ab pehle se kahin bada ho gaya tha
 This trick was used several times to fool analysts about the progress of various areas of Enron to improve stock prices
 "at the beginning of 2001, the Enron Corporation, the world's dominant energy trader, appeared unstoppable
 The company's decade-long effort to persuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from California to New York
 Its ties to the Bush administration assured that its views would be heard in Washington

 "on March 5, Bethany mclean's Fortune article Is Enron Over Priced?" Questioned how Enron could maintain its high stock price, trading at an asset worth 55 times its earnings
 unhone bataaya ki vishleshkon or niveshkon ko bilkul nahin maaloom tha ki enron kis tarah apana aay arjeet kar rahaa tha
 mclean was first drawn to the company's position at the suggestion of an analyst, looking at the company's 10-K report where he found "strange transactions", "erratic cash flows" and "huge debt"

 " In a conference call on April 17, the now 2001 CEO Skilling verbally attacked Wall Street analyst Richard Grubman during a call to a record conference accounting inquiry that Enron is unusual about

 that donkey when "it became an internal joke among many Enron employees, which led to him being ridiculed with slogans like" Ask Why, Acehole "for Grubman's alleged interference with Skilling's lack of tact

 By the 1990s Enron's stock was trading at a rate of $ 80–90 per share, and some seemed to be concerned about the ambiguity of the company's financial disclosure

" 14 agast ko skilling ne ghoshnaa kii ki bas chah maheene baad hi vah apane siio ke pad se istifa de rahe hai
 Skilling worked for a long time as president and COO before being elevated to the position of CEO
 skilling ne company chhodane ke peeche nijee kaarnon ke hone kaa hawala diya

 le ne ghoshnaa kii ki ve khud ek baar phir mukhya kaaryakari adhikari kaa pad sanbhaalenge
 The next day, however, Skilling admitted that one of the most important reasons for his departure was Enron's faltering price in the stock market
 da neuyork times main likhane vaale stanbhakaar paul krugaman ne dridhtaapurvak kaha ki enron urja jaisi chizon ke aviniman or roopantaran se hone vaale parinaamon kaa ek udhaaharan tha
 a few days later, in a letter to the editor, Kenneth Lay defended Enron and the company's philosophy: The example Mr
 Krugman cites of "financialization" run amok is the product of exactly his kind of system, with active government intervention at every step
 Indeed, the only winners in the California fiasco were the government-owned utilities of Los Angeles, the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia
 The disaster that squandered the wealth of California was born of regulation by the few, not by markets of the many
 On August 15, Sharon Watkins, Vice President of Corporate Development, wrote an anonymous letter to Lay warning him of the company's accounting practices
 There was a space in the letter saying "I am so impatient because we are about to explode in a wave of accounting scandals
" " watkins ne ek dost se sampark kiya jo arthur anderson ke liye kaam karte the or watkins dwaara uthaae gaye muddon par unke dost ne lekha pareekshan ke bhagidaaron ko dene ke liye ek gyaapan taiyaar kiya
 On August 22, Walkins himself met Le and gave him a six-page letter explaining further details on Enron's accounting issues
 Lay asked him if he had told anyone outside the company about it and then he vowed to have the company's law firm, Vinson & Elkins, review these issues, although Watkins argued
 Given that conflict of interest will begin with the use of this establishment
 Lay consulted with other officials and although he wanted to remove Watkins from the job, he decided against his idea to stop the lawsuit
 15 oktober ko vinson and elkins ne ghoshnaa kii ki enron ne apni lekhankan prathaon main kuch galat nahin kiya tha kyonki anderson ne prayek mudde main manjuuri di thi
 Something is rotten with the state of Enron

 Some observers suggested that Enron investors were not so much in need of reassurance again simply because the company's business was difficult to understand, but also because it was difficult to describe the company properly in financial statements
 ek vishleshak ne bataaya "vishleshkon ke liye yah nirdhaarit karnaa sachmuch kathin tha ki ek pradutt timahi main kahaan se paisa aa rahaa he or kahaan ja rahaa he
 "lay admitted that Enron's business was too complex, but asserted that analysts would" never get all the information they wanted "to satisfy their curiosity
 He also explained that mostly because of tax strategies and position-hedging Business was so complicated
 le ke prayaason ko shaayad simit safalataa hasil hui thi; 9 sitambar tak ek pramukh bachaav nidhi prabandhak ne tippanee kii ki " stock kaa vyapaar gupachup ho rahaa he
 "skilling's sudden departure with the opacity of Enron's accounting ledgers made it difficult for Wall Street to properly evaluate
 In addition, the company repeatedly acknowledged using" related-party transactions " Some feared that it could be easily used to deal losses, otherwise it could have appeared in Enron's balance sheet

 standard and pors ke ek vishleshak ne kaha "mujhe nahin lagata ki kisi ko broadband oparation kaa mulya maaloom he
 " enron kii prabandhan team ne daawa kiya ki ye ghate zyaadaatar nivesh ke ghate kii vajah se hue the or saath main kuch shulkon kii vajah se bhi hue the, jaise - company kii kshtmay broadband vyapaarik sanstha ke punarnirmaan main lagbhag 180 million dollar kharch hua tha

 In an effort to clarify the multimillion-dollar scam allegations and placate investors, Enron's revelations revealed that "the shares were disposed of under cost-prohibitive arrangements," "derivative forms of existing restricted forward contracts The contingent nature was eliminated "and some strategies" defended certain business investments and other assets

 Secondly, Lay remained firm that there was no impropriety in Enron's transactions with Fastow-run partnerships and emphasized his support for the CFO
 Goldman analyst David Fleischer was once again confused, saying to Lay and Fastow, "there is something you are hiding
" " phir bhi, flessur stock ko lekar apni baat par atal rahe, unka tark tha ki unhen nahin lagata ki lekhaakaaron or lekhaparikshakon ko is tarah kii chal-kapat karne kii puri azaadi mili hogi

 us samay yah khabar mili thi ki teen sabase badi rinpaatrata nirdhaaran agenciyon main se do moodis or fich ne sambhavit avnati kii samiksha ke liye enron ko nirdhaarit kiya tha

 Commentators commented on the variety of corporate interactions between Dynegy and Enron, and on the "forthright" personality of Dynegy CEO Charles Watson
 Some wondered whether Enron's difficulties were simply the result of innocent accounting errors
 By November, Enron was insisting that the billion-dollar "one-time fee" disclosed in October should actually be $ 200 million and that the balance should be only for the correction of passive accounting mistakes
 Many feared that other "mistakes" and recurrences could also be detected
 enron kii kamai kaa ek anya pramukh sudhaar 9 navambar ko ghoshit kiya gaya jisamen varsh 1997-2000 ke kathith rajasav par 591 million dollar kii katautee kii baat bhi saamne ai

 In addition, concerns about antitrust regulatory barriers were increasing, which was likely to be unveiled, and at the same time the culture of some observers was fundamentally different from Enron and Dynegy's corporate culture
 donon companiyaan is saude ke liye tatpar thi or kuch paryvekshakon ashanvit the; urja bazaar main sabase badi upasthiti kaa nirmaan karne ke prayaas main watson kii drushti ke liye unki prashansa kii gai

" " ek vishleshak ne is saude ko "ek mahasooth kaha yah vittiya taur par ek bahut acha sauda he, jise nishchit rup se samrik drushti se ek acha sauda hona chahie or yah enron ke liye kuch tatkaaleen tulan patr saavdhaaniyaan pradaan karata he
 " haalanki, rin sambandhi mudde or bhi gambhir rup dhaaran karte ja rahe the
 While publicly disclosing the purchase, both Moody's and S&P lowered Enron's status to only one mark above the junk status

 In the conference call, S&P confirmed that if Enron was not acquired, S&P would cut it to a rating of BB or higher BB which would "not even be at the end of the junk"
 In addition, many traders had limited their involvement with Enron for fear of receiving more bad news, or stopped doing business together

 By mid-november, Enron announced that it had plans to sell underperforming assets of approximately $ 8 billion and a common plan to cut the scale of the loss in the interest of financial stability
 To go On November 19, Enron revealed to the public more evidence of its critical condition
 sabase zyada dabaav is baat kaa pad rahaa tha ki company ko varsh 2002 ke ant tak 9 billian dollar kii seemaa main rin chukauti dayitvon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa tha

 In a statement, Enron revealed "an adverse outcome is likely to have a material adverse effect on Enron's ability to continue as a profitable business entity
" " Two days later, on November 21, Wall Street expressed serious doubts that Dynegy would pursue its deal as a whole, or to basically seek renegotiation
 In addition, Enron revealed in a 10-Q filing that almost all the money it had recently taken as a loan for several purposes, including the purchase of its commercial paper, or about $ 5 billion, had run out in just 50 days

 Watson later said, "in the end, you couldn't give it to me

 Scale on a map means the ratio of distances between two points shown on the map and their corresponding surface locations
 saanchaa:is lekh kii vartanee thik karne kii aavashyaktaa he The scale is the ratio of the actual distance between any two points on the plane and the distance between the same two points on the map
 saral shabdon m kaha ja saktaa he k dharaatal va maanach k dooray ke anupaat ko maapak kehete ha
 For example, the actual distance between two places on the ground is 1 km
 1 cm in the map
 m If shown by 1 m = 1 km There will be a scale of that map

 This is the simplest method because even a simple reading account can calculate distances by understanding it
 paratu is vadh kaa upyog simat he, yak yah maapak usee desh m padhaa ja saktaa he, jahaan yah maap pat chalat he
 Decade Bhan method: This is a regulatory measure in which the measure is shown as a Bhan
 ism ansh maanach k dur ko tathaa har dharaatal k vaatavak dur ko cat karata he
 The value of the numerator is always 1 unit, for example, if a decade of a map is 1 / 100, 000, one unit of the map is equal to 100,000 units of the ground
 is vadh k sabase adhak upyogta he yak dashak bhan se kasi bhi desh m vahaan k maap nal se raikhak dooryaan t k ja sakati he ran maapni pard ja sakati he
 Graphical slaughter: It is also called a linear measure

 = 5 reduction on the ground
 1 cm = 5 x 1 xxrep 5 0 cm Therefore, decade 1: 5 xxrep 5 0 2 cm = 1 km, 2 hectamers and 6 decameters 2 cm

 Example: In a map, the distance between a and b is 2
4 cm
 And their actual distance on the ground is 12 km, then find the scale of that map- Solution: Maple distance: Surface distance is 2

 Indian astrology is made up of three parts - Astro, Samhita and Hora
 falit jyotish kaa doosraa naam he - horashastra
 Where developed rules are established on the resultant side of astrology, it is horastra
 udaahranarth: raashi, hora, dreshkan, navamaansh, chalit, dwadabhav, shodash varg, grahon ke digbal, kaal-bal, cheshtaa-bal, grahon ke dhaatu, dravya, kaarkatv, yogayog, ashtavarg, drushtibal, aayu yoga, vivaah yoga, naam sanyog, anisht yoga, striyon ke janmafal, unki mrityu nashtagarbha kaa lakshan prashn aadi horashastra ke antargat aate hai
 By the way Hora means - one hour
 ahoratr shabd se ’a’ or ’tra’ hataane ke baad hora shabd banataa he
 Table of contents kisi manushya ke janmakaleen lagn dwaara uske jivan ke sampoorn sukh-dukh kaa nirnay pehle hi kar dena hora skandh kaa saamanytah mul swaroop he
 The Hora Wing is also called the Jataka Wing
 kaalaantar main iske bhi do bhaag ho gaye
 The subject related to Jataka was called Jataka and the second part became Tajik
 jyotish shaastra kaa jo skandh kundaliyon kaa nirmaan karata he or jo vyakti vishesh se sambandhit he vah horashastra yaa jataka ke naam se vikhyath he

 brihajjatak main aayaa he ki kuch logon ke mat se hora, 'ahoratr' shabd ke pehle evam antim aksharon ko nikaal dene se bana he
 Horashastra well expresses the good or bad fruits done in earlier lives
 vrihajatak main varahamihir ne do baton par vishesh bal diya he- Horashastra does not say that the planets of a person's horoscope force him to do this or that, but that the horoscope only tells which direction the person's future is oriented
 saravali main kalyaan burma ne bhi kaha he ki jo jatakashastra he vahi horashastra he or yah niyati ke vishay main vivechan kaa paryaayavachi he
 It is very helpful in earning money, objectionable is like a vessel in the sea and is like a minister in a voyage or attack

 isko na lagaaya jaay to tub se bahut adhik dhara bahegi jiske anekon hanikaarak prabhaav honge
 It is important to note that the tube has a special property that its voltage is reduced when the current increases, ie it exhibits negative resistance
 vaidyut bellast tarah-tarah kii dizin ke hote hai
 For example a resistance, inductance or capacitor placed in a series can act as a simple ballast

 aaj, "game theory" samaaj vigyaan ke taarkik paksh ke liye ek chhatari yaa 'uniphoid field' theory kii tarah he jisamen 'saamaajik' kii vyakhya maanav ke saath-saath duusare khilaadiyon ko sammilit kar kii jaati he
 Traditional applications of game theory attempt to find similarities in these games
 samyavastha main game kaa prayek khilaadi ek niti apanaataa he jo vah sambhawatah nahin badalata he
 Many concepts of equilibrium have been developed to understand this idea
 samyavastha ke in avadharanaon kii abhiprerana alag-alag hoti he or is baat par nirbhar karti he ki ve kis kshetra main prayog kii ja raheen hai, haalaanki unke myne kuch had tak ek duusare main mili-jule hote hai or mail khate hai
 This method is not critical and debates continue over the suitability of particular concepts of equilibrium, the appropriateness of societies, and generally the utility of mathematical models
 haalaanki iske pehle hi is kshetra main kuch vikaas chuke the, game theory kaa kshetra jon won neumann or auskar morganstern kii 1944 kii pustak theory of games and iconomik biheviar ke saath aastitiv main aayaa
 This theory was largely developed by many scholars in the 1950s
 baad main game theory spashtatya 1970 ke dashak main jeev vigyaan main prayukt kiya gaya, haalaanki aisa 1930 ke dashak main hi shuru ho chukaa tha
 Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields
 aath game theorists arthshaastra main nobel puraskaar jeet chuke hai or jon menard smith ko game theory ke jeev vigyaan main prayog ke liye krafurd puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 Games observed in game theory are clearly defined mathematical 'objects'
 ek game khilaadiyon ke ek set, khilaadiyon ke paas uplabdh chaalon ke ek set or nitiyon ke prayek sangyojan ke laabh ke nirdhaaran se bana hota he
 Most 'cooperative games' are represented in special function forms, while the Extensive and Normal forms are used to define nonoperative games
 ekstensive form kaa prayog kuch mahatvapurn anukram vaale gemon ko 'formalaise' karne main kiya ja saktaa he
 Games in this are often represented as 'trees', with each vertex indicating a point of choice for a player
 khilaadi 'vartex' dwaara soochibaddh ek sankhya dwaara nirdisht kiya jaataa he
 The lines that exit the vertex represent a possible action of that player
 laabh tree ke nichle hisse main nirdisht kiye jate hai
 The game depicted here featured two players
 khilaadi 1 pehle chaal chalata he or yaa to f yaa u chunata he
 Player 2 sees the move of player 1 and then chooses either a or R
 maane ki khilaadi 1 u chunata he or phir khilaadi 2 a chunata he, tab khilaadi 1, 8 paata he or khilaadi 2, paata he 
 Extensive form, games in which both moves do not go together and games in which information is not confirmed, can also explain these two types of games
 ise nirupit karne ke liye vibhinn vartexon ko- unhen ek hi soochna set kaa hissaa dikhaane ke liye - yaa to ek bindidaar rekha se joda jaataa he, yaa unke darmyaan ek band rekha khinchi jaati he
 Normal is usually represented by a matrix in which players, moves and gains are marked
 aam taur par yah kisi aise function ke dwaara nirupit kiya ja saktaa he jo prayek khilaadi ke chaalon ke sabhi sanyojanon ke laabh se sambaddh rahata he
 The accompanying example has two players; Selects one row and the other column
 Each player has two strategies specified by the number of rows and columns
 laabh andar main die gaye hai
 The first number is the gain received by the player with the cry; The second number is the profit received by the player with the column
 maane ki agar khilaadi 1 upar chalata he khilaadi 2 baayen chalata he
 Then player 1 gains 4 and player 2 gains 3
 jab ek khel narmal form main prastut kiya jaataa he, yah mana jaataa he ki prayek khilaadi ek saath chaal chalate hai yaa kam se kam duusare ke chaalon se anbhigya hote hai
 If players have any idea of each other's choices, the game is usually presented in extensible form
 hastantaraneey upyogita vaale 'kooparative' gemon main koi bhi swatantra alag laabh nahin die rahete hai
 Instead, the characteristic function determines the gain for each alliance
 maanak dharna yah he ki khaali gathbandhan ko 0 laabh praapt hota he
 The earliest source of this form comes from the foundational book of von Neumann and Morgenstern
 unhone coalishnal normal form gemon kaa adhyayan karte samay yah mana ki jab ek gathbandhan c { \ displaystyle C} c banataa he, yah sampoorak gathbandhan ke viruddh kheltaa he jaise ki wo 2 khilaadiyon vaala game khel rahe hon
 The equilibrium gain of c { \ displaystyle C} c is characteristic
 ab normal form gemon se coalishnal maan nikaalane ke liye vibhinn model hai, par kairactaristic form ke saare game normal form gemon se vyuttpann nahin kiye ja sakate
 As a rule, a characteristic function form game is represented as a pair { \ displaystyle} where n { \ displaystyle N} expresses a set of players and v: 2 n ⟶ r { \ displaystyle v: 2 ^ { N} \ longrightarrow \ mathbb {R}} is a characteristic function
 kairactaristic function form bina hastantaraneey upyogita ke anumargan vaale gemon main samanyikrut kiya gaya he
 The characteristic function form ignores possible 'externalities' of the formation of 'coalescence'
 partishan function form main 'coalishan' kaa laabh sirf iske sadasyon par hi nirbhar nahin karata balki is par bhi nirbhar karata he ki baaki khilaadi kis rup main vibhajit hai
 Game theory has been used in a detailed study of the diverse behaviors of humans and animals
 shuru main yah arthshaastra main aarthik vyavhaar ke ek bade sangrah ko samajhane ke liye viksit kiya gaya tha, jinamein companiyon, bazaaron or upbhogem theory ke vyavhaar shaamil hai
 The use of game theory in the social sciences has expanded further, and game theory has also been used in the study of political, social and psychological behaviors
 game theory aadhaarit vishleshan kaa upyog shuru main 1930 ke dashak main ronaald fisher ne pashuon ke vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karne ke liye kiya tha 
 This work dates back to the existence of the name "game theory", but many of the features of it and game theory are similar
 arthshaastra main hue iske vikaas kaa baad main jeev vigyaan main prayogjon menard smith ne apni pustak evolution and da theory of games main kiya
 In addition to predicting and explaining behavior, game theory has also been used to attempt to develop theories of moral or normative behavior
 arthshaastra or darshanashastra main, vidwaanon ne game theory ko achche yaa uchit vyavhaar ko samajhane main bhi prayukt kiya he
 If we go back, we can see that Plato also presented this kind of connotation based on game theory

 In each of these areas, researchers have developed game theory-based models in which players are often voters, states, special interest groups, and politicians

 This research usually focuses on specific sets of strategies, called balance in sports
 ye “samaadhaan avadharanayen” saamanytah taarkikta ke niyamon kii aavashyaktaaon par aadhaarit hoti hai
 Among non-cooperative games, Nash equilibrium is the most famous of these
 ranneetiyon kaa ek samucchy yadi anya ranneetiyon ke prati sarvshereshth pratikriya kaa pratinidhitiv karata ho, to vah naish santulan he
 So if all players are making their moves in Nash equilibrium, there will be no unilateral temptation to move away from the path between them, since their strategy is the best, so they can do what the other players are doing
 khilaadiyon kii vyaktigem theory upyogita kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye saamanytah khel ke munaafe ko liya jaataa he
 In ideal situations, profits often represent wealth, possibly related to a person's utility
 haalaanki yah dharna trutipurna ho sakati he
 a paradigmatic paper on game theory in economics begins by presenting a game that is an abbreviation for a specific economic situation
 ek yaa ek se adhik samaadhaan avadharanayen chuni jaati hai or lekhak yah pradarshit karata he ki prastut khel main ranneeti ke koun-se samucchy upyukt prakaar ke santulan main hai
 Naturally, we may wonder what to use this information for
 arthshaastri or vyapaarik professor do praathmik upyogon kaa suzav dete hai: varnanaatmak or aadeshaatmak
 The first known use is to describe how the human population behaves
 kuch vidwaan maanate hai ki khelon ke santulanon kii khoj kar lene par ve is baat kaa purvanumaan kar sakate hai ki jis khel kaa adhyayan kiya ja rahaa he, usamen varnit sthitiyon jaisi sthitiyon se saamana hone par vaastavik maanav aabaadi kis prakaar kaa vyavhaar karegi
 This specific approach to game theory is facing the latest criticism
 sabase pehle, isaki aalochana is baat ko lekar kii jaati he ki game theorycaron dwaara banaai gai dharanaon kaa aksar ulanghan hota he
 Game theorists may assume that players always work in the same way to directly increase their victories to the maximum level, but in practice, human nature often differs from this model
 is tathy kii anek vyakhyaayen hai: tarkheenata, vivechna ke naye model, yaa yahan tak ki vibhinn prerak 
 In response, game theorists compare their assumptions with those used in physics
 is prakaar haalaanki unki dharanayen sadaiv sahi sabit nahin hotin, lekin ve game theory ko bhautik-shastriyon dwaara prayukt pratimaanon ke samaan vaigyanik adarsh ke rup main prayog kar sakate hai
 However, some additional criticism is also leveled at the use of this game theory as some studies have demonstrated that individuals do not use balance strategies
 udhaaharan ke liye shatpad khel main, ek ausat khel kaa 2 / 3 bhaag anumaan par aadhaarit hota he or taanashaah khel main log niyamit rup se naish santulanon ke dwaara nahin khelte
 The debate over the importance of these studies continues
 vaikalpik rup se, kuch lekhak daawa karte hai ki naish santulan maanav aabaadiyon ke liye purvanumaan nahin pradaan karte, balki ve is baat kii vyakhya karte hai ki naish santulanon se khilne vaali aabaadiyaan us avasthaa main hi kyon bani rahati hai
 However, the question remains open how populations reach that point
 apni chintaaon ke samaadhaan ke liye kuch siddhantkaar vikasvaadi game theory kii ore mud gayi hai
 These paradigms either assume no rationality for players or assume restricted rationality
 apane naam ke baavjood vikasvaadi game theory aavashyak rup se jaivik arth main prakritik chayan ko nahin maanata
 Evolutionary game theory encompasses both biological as well as cultural development and the paradigm of individual game theory education
 duusari ore, kuch vidwaan game theory ko manushyon ke vyavhaar ke liye ek bhavishyasuchak upkaran ke rup main nahin, balki is baat ke ek suzav ke rup main dekhte hai ki logon ko kis prakaar kaa vyavhaar karnaa chaiye
 Since a Nash equilibrium of a game produces the individual's best response to other players' game theory methods, it seems appropriate to play a trick that is part of the Nash equilibrium
 haalaanki, game theory ke liye yah prayog bhi aalochana ke antargem theory aa gaya he
 First, in some cases it is appropriate to use a non-equilibrium strategy when the individual is expected to use a non-equilibrium strategy by other players as well
 ek udhaaharan ke liye, ausat kaa 2 / 3 anumaan dekhen
 Second, the prisoner's dilemma presents another possible counter-example
 kaidi kaa asamanjas main, apane swaarth kii purti kaa prayaas karte hue prayek khilaadi donon khilaadiyon ko usase buree sthiti main le aata he, jisamen ve apane swaarth kii purti kaa prayaas na karne par rahe hote
 In contrast to economics, the benefits for sports in biology are often explained in terms of merit

 haalaanki isaki praarambhik prerana main naish santulan kii koi bhi maansik aavashyaktaa shaamil nahin thi, lekin prayek ESS ek naish santulan hota he
 Game theory has been used to understand many different facts in biology
 sabase pehle iskaa upyog 1:1 ling anupaat kii utpatti kii vyakhya karne ke liye kiya gaya tha
 Suggested that the 1: 1 sex ratio is the result of evolutionary forces acting on individuals who can be seen as attempting to increase the number of their grandchildren to the maximum level

 Biologists have used the game of chicks to analyze territoriality and fighting behavior
 khelon kii utpatti or siddhant kii prastaavna main menard smith likhte hai, “rodhabhasi rup se, yah paaya gaya he ki game theory arthshaastreey vyavhaar ke kshetra, jiske liye vah mul rup se banaaya gaya tha, kii bajaay jeevigyaan par zyaada acchhee tarah lagu hota he”
 Evolutionary game theory has been used to explain many of the facts that seem to be Asangem Theory in nature
 aise hi ek tathy ko jaivik paropkaarita kehete hai
 This is a situation in which an organism appears to be acting in such a manner, which is beneficial to other organisms and detrimental to itself
 yah paropkaarita kii paaramparik dharna se bhinn he, kyonki aise kaary sachetan nahin hote, balki sakal yogyata ko badhaane ke liye vikasvaadi anukulan ke rup main dikhaai dete hai
 Examples of this include vampire bats, who spew blood from night prey and pass it on to members of their group who have failed to hunt, from worker bees, who serve the lifelong queen bee, and sometimes Do not mingle, ranging from vervet monkeys, who warn group members about the hunter's arrival, even if it threatens their own lives Are
 inamen se sabhi kaary ek samooh kii sakal yogyata ko badhaate hai, lekin aisa karne ke liye ek jeev ko apni jaan ganvaani padati he
 Evolutionary game theory describes this altruism as the idea of relative selection
 paropkaaree jeev un praaniyon ke bich bhed-bhav karte hai, jinaki ve sahaayta karte hai or ve apane sambandhiyon kaa paksh lete hai
 Hamilton's law explains the evolutionary logic behind this selection by the formula c <b * r, where the logistic theory applied to a philanthropist must be less than the product of the coefficient of profit and affiliation
 do jeevon ke bich nikatataa jitani adhik hogi, paropkaarita kii ghatnayen bhi utani hi bad jaaengi kyonki unke anek genetic tatv samaan honge
 This means that the philanthropic organism may abandon the option of giving birth to one's own offspring, ensuring that the genetic elements of its close relatives are transmitted further
 
 udaahranarth, kisi sahodar kii sahaayta karne kaa gunank 1 / 2 hota he kyonki jeev apane sahodar kii santan main 1 / 2 genetic tatv saajha karata he
 Ensuring that a substantial number of siblings survive to adulthood eliminates the need for a philanthropist to produce his or her own
 gunank maan khel ke maidan ke daayre par atyadhik ashrith hote hai: udaahranarth, jinke prati pakshpaat karnaa he, unke chunaav main yadi sabhi genetic jivit vasteen, keval sambandhi nahin, shaamil hon, to ham maanate hai ki sabhi manushyon ke bich antar khel ke maidan main vividhta kaa lagbhag 1% hota he, jo gunank ek chote kshetra main 1 / 2 tha, vah 0
995 ho jaataa he
 Similarly, if it is considered that any information other than genetic information remains with time, then the playing field becomes bigger and the discrimination becomes smaller

 Game theory has many uses in philosophy
 saanchaa:harvard citations / core dwaara prastut do shodh-patron par pratikriya dete hue, Lewis ne sammelan kii ek darshanik samaj viksit karne ke liye game theory kaa prayog kiya
 In doing so, he provided a preliminary analysis of general knowledge and used it to analyze sports in synergy sports
 iske atirikt, pehle unhone yah suzav diya ki vyakti arth ko sanket khelon ke sandarbh main samaj saktaa he
 This suggestion has been used by many philosophers after Lewis, (harvard citations / core)
 Following the game-theoretic Lewis of conventions, Ullmann Margellit and Bicherry have developed theories of social rules that form the Nash equilibria that result from converting a mixed-purpose game into a synergy game
 Let's define
 game theory darshanikon ko antahkriyaatmak gyanamimasaa ke sambandh main sochane kii chunauti bhi detaa he: kisi samooh ke liye samaan vishwaason yaa gyaan kaa kya arth hota he or abhikartaaon kii antahkriya ke kaaran milanevaale saamaajik parinaamon par is gyaan kaa kya prabhaav padataa hai
 Philosophers working in this field include Bicherry, Skirmes, and Stalnaker

 Some of the predictions used in parts of game theory have been challenged in philosophy; Psychological egoism states that rationality reduces self-interest — a claim that is a matter of debate for philosophers
 ek khel sahakaari hota he, yadi khilaadi bandhankaree patibaddhtaon kaa nirmaan kar paane main sakasham hon
 For example, the legal system makes it necessary for them to follow their word
 gaiyr-sahakaari khelon main yah sambhav nahin hota
 It is often believed that communication between players is allowed in cooperative games, but not in non-cooperative games
 yah vargeekaran do dwiadhari kasautiyon ke aadhaar par asweekaar kar diya gaya he
 Of the two types of games, non-cooperative games are capable of performing situations to the best of detail and produce accurate results
 sahakaari khel vyapak rup se khel par kendrit hote hai
 Significant efforts have been made to connect these two routes
 tathakthith naish-program ne pehle hi anek sahakaari sthitiyon ko gaiyr-sahakaari santulanon ke rup main sthapit kar diya he
 Hybridized games have cooperative and non-cooperative elements
 udhaaharan ke liye sahakaari khelon main khilaadiyon ke gathbandhan banaaye jate hai, lekin ve ek gaiyr-sahakaari style main khelte hai
 a symmetrical game is a game in which the benefit of playing according to a specific strategy depends only on the other strategies used, not on those who play them
 yadi ranneetiyon se milanevaale munaafe ko badale bina khilaadiyon kii pahchaan badali ja sakati ho, to khel samamit hota he
 Many of the commonly studied 2 × 2 games are symmetric
 chikan, qaidi kaa asamanjas or barasinghe kaa shikaar ke maanak pradarshan sabhi samamit khel hai
 Some scholars may consider various asymmetric games as examples of these games
 haalaanki inamen se prayek khel ke liye sarvaadhik prachlit laabh samamit hote hai
 The most studied asymmetric games are those games that do not have the same set of strategies for both players
 udhaaharan ke liye, altimet game or dictator game main prayek khilaadi ke liye bhinn ranneetiyaan hoti hai
 However, it is also possible that a game has the same strategies for both players and is still asymmetric
 udhaaharan ke liye, donon khilaadiyon ke liye ranneetiyon ke samaan samucchy hone ke baavjood bhi dahini ore chitrit khel asamamit he
 Zero-sum games are special examples of steady-sum games, in which selections made by players neither increase nor decrease the available resources
 shunya-raashi khelon main, ranneetiyon ke prayek sangyojan ke liye, khel ke sabhi khilaadiyon ko milanevaale kul laabh kaa yogafal shunya hota he 
 The game of poker represents an example of a zero-sum game because any player wins the same amount of money as his opponent loses
 anya shunya-raashi khelon main sikkon kaa milan or go tathaa shatranj sahit adhikansh shastreey board khel shaamil hai
 Most of the games that have been studied by game theorists are non-zero-sum games because some of those receipts have gross results greater or less than zero
 anaupchaarik rup se, gaiyr-shunya-raashi khelon main, kisi ek khilaadi ko milanevaala laabh aavashyak taur par kisi anya khilaadi ko hone vaali haani se judaa nahin hota
 Fixed-sum games are related to game theory methods such as theft and gambling, but not to the fundamental economic situation in which the profits from the trade are probable
 ek atirikt nakli khilaadi, jisaki haniyaan khilaadi ke shuddh laabh kii kshatipurti karti hai, ko jodakar kisi bhi khel ko ek shunya-raashi khel main roopantarit kar paanaa sambhav hota he
 Simultaneous games are games in which both players play their moves together, or if they do not move simultaneously, the latter are ignorant of the moves of the first players
 aanukramik khel aise khel hote hai, jinamein baad main khilne vaale khilaadiyon ko purvavarti chaalon kii kuch jaankaree hoti he
 It is not necessarily complete knowledge of each game theory method of preceding players; This can be very little information
 udhaaharan ke liye, sambhav he ki koi khilaadi yah jaanata ho ki kisi purvavarti khilaadi ne koi vishisht chaal nahin chali thi, jabaki vah yah na jaanata ho ki pehle khilaadi ne anya uplabdh chaalon main se vastutah koun-si chaal chali thi
 The main differences between synchronous and sequential games are included in the various performances discussed above
 aksar, samakalik khelon ko darshane ke liye saamaanya rup kaa or aanukramik khelon ko darshane ke liye vistrut rup kaa prayog kiya jaataa he; haalaanki, takneekee rup se yah koi sakht niyam nahin he
 An important subset of sequential games consists of complete information
 ek khel purna jaankaree se yukt hota he, yadi sabhi khilaadi anya khilaadiyon dwaara pehle chali gai chaalon ke bare main jaanate hon
 Thus, only sequential games can be complete information because in synchronous games each player does not know the moves of other players
 game theory main adhyayan kiye jane vaale adhikansh khel apurna-jaankaree vaale khel hote hai, haalaanki, altimet game or shatpad khel sahit purna-jaankaree vaale khelon ke kuch rochak udhaaharan uplabdh hai
 Full-fledged games include chess, go, mankala and arima
 purna jaankaree ko aksar samast jaankaree samaj liya jaataa he, jo ek sadrush avadharana he
 For all the information, each player is required to know the strategies and realizations of other players, but it is not necessary to have knowledge of their game theory methods
 arthshaastriyon or vaastavik-vishwa ke khilaadiyon dwaara adhyayan kiye jane vaale khel saamanytah chaalon kii simit sankhya main samaapt ho jate hai
 Pure mathematicians are not as constrained, and set theorists typically study games that persist for an unlimited number of moves, and the winner in them is not known until after the completion of all those moves
 saamanytah dhyaan is baat par zyaada kendrit nahin hota ki aise khelon ko khilne kii sarvshereshth vidhi kya he, balki keval is par hota he ki kya kisi khilaadi ke paas jeetne kii ranneeti he

 The majority of game theory relates to limited, discrete games, with limited number of players, moves, events, results, etc

 Continuous games allow their players to select a strategy from a continuous strategy set

 Inferior games, such as the Continuous Pursuit and Evasion games, are continuous games
 vyaktigem theory nirnay samasyaon ko kabhi-kabhi "ek-khilaadi vaale khel" mana jaataa he
 Although these conditions are not game theoretic, they are constructed using several of the same tools as the Ingem Theory of Decision Theory rules
 keval do yaa do se adhik khilaadiyon ke hone par hi koi samasya khel saidhantik banati he
 Often a random player is added, who performs "opportunistic moves", also known as "natural moves"
 do-khilaadiyon vaale kisi khel main is khilaadi ko teesraa khilaadi nahin mana jaataa, balki khel main jahaan aavashyak ho, vahaan vah keval paase kii bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Games with an unlimited number of players are often called n-person games

 The first known discussion of game theory occurred in 1713 in a letter written by James Waldegrave
 is patr main waldegrev taash ke khel le har ke do-vyaktiyon vaale sanskaran ke samaadhaan ke liye ek minimax mishrit siddhant pradaan karte hai
 James Madison produced what we now know to be a game-theoretic analysis of how the differential theory states of different mechanisms of taxation can be expected to behave
 antony augustin cornt dwaara 1838 main Recherches sur les principes mathématiques de la théorie des richesses kaa prakaashan kiye jane tak kisi saamaanya khel saidhantik vishleshan kaa anusaran nahin kiya jaataa tha
 In this work Cornett considers a duopoly and presents a solution, which is a limited version of the Nash equilibrium
 haalaanki cornt kaa vishleshan waldegrev ke vishleshan se adhik saamaanya he, lekin jon won newman dwaara 1928 main shodh-patron kii ek shrunkhlaa kaa prakaashan kiye jane se purv tak ek adwitiya kshetra ke rup main game theory kaa vastutah koi astitv nahin tha
 Although the French mathematician Emily Borel did some preliminary work on the games, von Neumann can reasonably be credited with being the inventor of the game theory
 won newman ek budhimaan ganitagya the, jinka kaary samucchy siddhant se lekar unki gananaaon, jo anu va hydrogen bamon donon ke vikaas kii kunjee thim or antat sanganakon ke vikaas ke unke kaary tak vyapak rup se faila hua tha
 Von Neumann's work in game theory reached its peak in 1944 in Von Neumann and Oscar Morgenstam's book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior
 is gahan kaary main do-vyaktiyon vaale shunya-raashi khelon ke liye paraspar sangem theory samaadhaanon kii khoj karne hetu vidhiyaan shaamil hai
 During this time period, work on game theory was primarily focused on cooperative game theory, which analyzes optimal strategies for a group of individuals, assuming they can enforce consensus among themselves about appropriate strategies
 1950 main, qaidi kaa asamanjas prakat hua or RAND corporation main is khel par ek prayog kiya gaya
 Around this time, John Nash developed a criterion for interrelated theory of player strategies, known as the Nash equilibrium, and a broader range of games than the one proposed by von Neumann and Morgenstheim

 The practice continues to some degree, however, where modern facilities are available today it may seem as female feticide

 Kalyanji Anandji has composed the music in the film, and the lyrics of the film have been penned by Anjan and Indivar
 amitabh bachchan ne film main anderworld bos 'don' kii, or uske hamshakl 'vijay' kii dohari bhoomika nibhaai thi
 The story of the film revolves around Vijay, a resident of Bombay's slums, who is incidentally a don's rival
 bombay police ke disipi di'silva vijay se don kaa rup lene ko kehete hai, taaki vah police ke mubir ke rup main kaam kar sake, or saath hi don ke aapraadhik network kaa bhandaphod karne main police kii madad kar saken
 'don' is an underworld criminal in Mumbai, who is looking for both the Mumbai Police and Interpol
 interpol kii 'most wanted' aparaadhiyon kii suchi main shaamil don har baar police ko chakma dekar bhaag nikalne main safal ho jaataa he
 Due to his ruthless nature, Don has other enemies besides the police
 pramukhtah don ne ek baar apane hi ek sahakarmi, ramesh kii hatya kar di thi, jiske baad uski mangetar 'kamini' tathaa bahan 'roma' don ke dushman ban gaye
 Kamini tries to seduce Dawn, so that the police come and capture Dawn, but Dawn manages to escape by taking Kamini hostage, and Kamini dies in this entire development
 kamini kii bhi mrityu se acroshit roma apane bal kataa leti he, or judo tathaa karate sikhkar don ke giroh main shaamil ho jaati he, taaki mauka paakar vah don ko maar de
 After several unsuccessful attempts to capture Dawn, the police finally succeed, and DCP d'silva is almost caught by Dawn, that Dawn dies, and d'silva's attempt to reach Dawn's boss
 The dream remains incomplete
 iske baad di'silva don ko vahiin dafna detaa he
 Vijay, who lives in a Mumbai slum, is a simple man who dances in Mumbai and is trying to raise his two children
 disipi di'silva kii mulaakaat ek baar vijay se hoti he, jisase unhen pataa chalata he, kii vijay don kaa hamshakl he, or vah vijay se don banane ko kehete hai, taaki vijay police kii mukhabiri kare, or uske raste di'silva is aapraadhik network kii tah tak pahunch paaen
 Vijay accepts them, and becomes a don and goes back to his gang, where he pretends to have lost his memory
 isi bich jasjit 'jeje' jail se chhot jaataa he
 Jasjeet was arrested by DCP d'silva; The reason jj's wife died, and her two children went missing
 uske donon bacchon, deepu tathaa munni kaa laalan-paalan isi bich vijay kar rahaa tha
 Vijay takes a 'red diary' of Don, and goes to meet DCP d'silva
 roma bhi uske saath jaati he, or vahaan use akelaa paakar vah us par hamalaa kar detii he
 d'silva arrives at the moment and tells Roma the reality of Vijay, and after this Roma also joins Vijay
 vijay vah diary di'silva ko de detaa he, or use padhakar unhen pataa chalata he ki don ke bos kaa naam varadhan he, parantu uske bare main isse adhik jaankaree us diary main nahin likhi hoti
 Slowly, Vijay learns more about Don, and one day with Roma's help, he announces that his memory has returned
 isi kushi main ek party hoti he, jisamen police kii red pad jaati he
 In this raid, DCP d'silva is badly injured in the shootout, and the police apprehend Vijay as a don
 vijay un logon ko sach bataata he, jiske baad police vaale use disipi di'silva ke paas hospital le jate he; kintu kuch bol paane se pehle hi disipi di'silva kii mrityu ho jaati he
 Vijay is being sent to a high-security prison by a truck, and he manages to escape from the truck
 iske baad vah swayan ko nirdosh sabit karne ke liye roma kii madad se khud koi tarkeeb sochane lagata he
 Vijay gets badly involved in this development, as the police refuse to believe that he is Vijay, and at the same time, Don's underworld gang realizes that he is not really Don
 upar se vah laal diary, jo usne disipi di'silva ko di thi, use jasjit chura le jaataa he
 Vijay succeeds in dodging both the police and Narang, the current ringleader of the underworld gang, with the help of Roma, and attempts to return to his old life
