 After this battle, Pakistan's first armored division was sent back to Sialkot where it did not participate further in the war

 Earlier, both of these air forces participated in the First Kashmir War in the 1940s, in which their contribution was much less and limited to transportation as compared to 1965 war

 It was widely circulated that Pakistan's American aircraft are better than Indian aircraft, but according to some experts this was not correct as the Indian Air Force's mig-21, Hawker Hunter and Folland Nate fighter's performance from their rival Pakistan's F-86 Saber Was better

 According to Indians, the F-86 was weak in front of the small Folland Nate, causing these aircraft to be called "saber destroyers"

 But according to Sajjad Haider, those aircraft did not deserve this honor because they were made with the "purpose of stopping and combating Soviet bombers flying at an altitude of more than 40,000 feet", not with low-speed fighter aircraft

 Both countries have made contrary claims to each other about the losses incurred in the fighting and few neutral sources have verified them

 According to a neutral source, the Pakistani Air Force flew 86 F-86 Sabers, 10 F-104 Starfighters, and 20 B-57 Canberra aircraft in a parade held shortly after the end of the war, claiming that the Indian Air Force had dropped 73 Pakistani aircraft
 It seems to be wrong, which was almost the entire first line of fighter jets of Pakistan at that time

 In addition, it is estimated that if the conflict had continued for three weeks, the Pakistani losses would have increased by 33 percent and India's losses would have been 15 percent

 At the beginning of the war, the Pakistani Army had both a numerical advantage in tanks, as well as better equipment overall
 Pakistani armor was largely American-made; It consisted mainly of Patton M-47 and M-48 tanks, but also included many M4 Sherman tanks, some M24 Chaffee light tanks and M36 Jackson tank destroyers, equipped with 90 mm guns
 The bulk of India's tank fleet were older M4 Sherman tanks; Some were up-gunned with the French high velocity CN 75 50 guns and could hold their own, whilst some older models were still equipped with the inferior 75 mm M3 l / 40 gun
 Besides the M4 tanks, India fielded the British-made Centurion Tank Mk 7, with the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, and the AMX-13, PT-76, and M3 Stuart light tanks
 Pakistan fielded a greater number and more modern artillery; At the outbreak of war in 1965, Pakistan had about 15 armoured cavalry regiments, each with about 45 tanks in three squadrons
 Besides the Pattons, there were about 200 M4 Shermans re-armed with 76 mm guns, 150 M24 Chaffee light tank and a few independent squadrons of M36B1 tank destroyers
 Most of these regiments served in Pakistan's two armoured divisions, the 1st and 6th Armoured divisions – the latter being in the process of formation
 The Indian Army of the time possessed 17 cavalry regiments, and in the 1950s had begun modernizing them by the acquisition of 164 AMX-13 light tanks and 188 Centurions
 The remainder of the cavalry units were equipped with M4 Shermans and a small number of M3A3 Stuart light tanks
 India had only a single armored division, the 1st 'black Elephant' Armored Division, also called 'fakhr-i-hind', which resulted of the 17th Cavalry, the 4th Hodson's Horse, the 16th 'black Elephant' Cavalry, the 7th Light Cavalry, the 2nd Lancers, the 18th Cavalry and the 62nd Cavalry, the two first named being equipped with Centurions
 There was also the 2nd Independent Armored Brigade, one of whose three regiments, the 3rd Cavalry, was also equipped with Centurions
 Despite the qualitative and numerical superiority of Pakistani armour, Pakistan was outfought on the battlefield by India, which made progress into the lahore-sialkot sector, whilst halting Pakistan's counteroffensive on Amritsar
; they were sometimes employed in a faulty manner, such as charging prepared defenses during the defeat of Pakistan's 1st Armoured Division at Assal Uttar
 Although India's tank formations experienced the same results, India's attack at the Battle of Chawinda, led by its 1st Armored Division and supporting units, was brought to a grinding halt by the newly raised 6th Armored Division in the Chawinda sector
 The Indians lost 120 tanks at Chawinda
 One true winner to emerge was India's Centurion battle tank, with its 105 mm gun and heavy armor, which proved superior to the overly complex Pattons and their exaggerated reputations
 However, in the Sialkot sector outnumbered Pattons performed exceedingly well in the hands of the 25th Cavalry and other regiments of the 6th Armored Division, which exacted a disproportionately heavy toll of Centurions from the Poona Horse and Hodson's Horse
 The Indian Army has made much of the fact that some of its Centurions survived repeated hits; yet have failed to point out that the majority of tanks in the Sialkot sector were Shermans whose guns were inadequate even in 1944
 Neither the Indian nor Pakistani Army showed any great facility in the use of armored formations in offensive operations, whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes The navies of India and Pakistan did not play a prominent role in the war of 1965, although Pakistani accounts dispute this
 On September 7, a flotilla of the Pakistani Navy carried out a small scale bombardment of the Indian coastal town and radar station of Dwarka, which was 200 miles south of the Pakistani port of Karachi
 Codenamed Operation Dwarka, it did not fulfill its primary objective of disabling the radar station and there was no immediate retaliatory response from India
 Later, some of the Indian fleet sailed from Bombay to Dwarka to patrol the area and deter further bombardment
 Foreign authors have noted that the "insignificant bombardment" of the town was a "limited engagement, with no strategic value
" According to some Pakistani sources, one submarine, PNS Ghazi, kept the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant besieged in Bombay throughout the war
 Indian sources claim that it was not their intention to get into a naval conflict with Pakistan, and wished to restrict the war to a land-based conflict
 Moreover, they note that the Vikrant was in dry dock in the process of refitting
 Some Pakistani defense writers have also discounted claims that the Indian Navy was bottled up in Bombay by a single submarine, instead stating that 75% of the Indian Navy was under maintenance in harbor
 The Pakistan Army launched a number of covert operations to infiltrate and sabotage Indian airbases
 On September 7, 1965, the Special Services Group commandos were parachuted into enemy territory
 According to Chief of Army Staff General Musa Khan, about 135 commandos were airdropped at three Indian airfields
 The daring attempt proved to be an "unmitigated disaster"
 Only 22 commandos returned to Pakistan as planned, 93 were taken prisoner, and 20 were killed in encounters with the army, police or civilians The reason for the failure of the commando mission is attributed to the failure to provide maps, proper briefings and adequate planning or preparation Despite failing to sabotage the airfields, Pakistan sources claim that the commando mission affected some planned Indian operations
 As the Indian 14th Infantry Division was diverted to hunt for paratroopers, the Pakistan Air Force found the road filled with transport, and destroyed many vehicles
 India responded to the covert activity by announcing rewards for captured Pakistani spies or paratroopers
 Meanwhile, in Pakistan, rumors spread that India had retaliated with its own covert operations, sending commandos deep into Pakistan territory, but these rumors were later determined to be unfounded
 Both India and Pakistan made absolutely mismatched claims about the loss of themselves and others
 donon deshon ke daavon kii sankshipt sarini is prakaar he There have been several neutral assessments of the losses incurred by both India and Pakistan during the war
 Most of these assessments agreed that India had an upper hand over Pakistan when ceasefire was declared
 Some of the neutral assessments are mentioned below - The war was militarily inconclusive; each side held prisoners and some territory belonging to the other
 Losses were relatively heavy—on the Pakistani side, twenty aircraft, 200 tanks, and 3,800 troops
 Pakistan's army had been able to withstand Indian pressure, but a continuation of the fighting would only have led to further losses and ultimate defeat for Pakistan
 Most Pakistanis, schooled in the belief of their own martial prowess, refused to accept the possibility of their country's military defeat by "hindu India" and were, instead, quick to blame their failure to attain their military aims on what they considered to be the ineptitude of Ayub Khan and his government
 Severely mauled by the larger Indian armed forces, Pakistan could continue the fight only by teaming up with Red China and turning its back on the UN The invading Indian forces outfought their Pakistani counterparts and halted their attack on the outskirts of Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city
 By the time sanyukt raashtra intervened on September 22, Pakistan had suffered a clear defeat
 The superior Indian forces, however, won a decisive victory and the army could have even marched on into Pakistani territory had external pressure not forced both combatants to cease their war efforts
 In three weeks the second indo-pak War ended in what appeared to be a draw when the embargo placed by Washington on U
S
 ammunition and replacements for both armies forced cessation of conflict before either side won a clear victory
 India, however, was in a position to inflict grave damage to, if not capture, Pakistan's capital of the Punjab when the cease-fire was called, and controlled Kashmir's strategic uri-poonch bulge, much to Ayub's chagrin
 India won the war
 It gained 1,840 square kilometers of Pakistani territory: 640 square kilometers in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan's portion of the state; 460 square kilometers of the Sailkot sector; 380 square kilometers far to the south of Sindh; and most critical, 360 square kilometers on the Lahore front
 Pakistan took 540 square kilometers of Indian territory: 490 square kilometers in the Chhamb sector and 50 square kilometers around Khem Karan
these are not correct pls review Although both sides lost heavily in men and material, and neither gained a decisive military advantage, bharat had the better of the war
 nai dilli achieved its basic goal of thwarting Pakistan's attempt to seize Kashmir by force
 Pakistan gained nothing from a conflict which it had instigated
 India's strategic aims were modest - it aimed to deny Pakistani Army victory, although it ended up in possession of 720 square miles of Pakistani territory for the loss of just 220 square miles of its own
 a brief but furious 1965 war with India began with a covert Pakistani thrust across the Kashmiri cease-fire line and ended up with the city of Lahore threatened with encirclement by Indian Army
 Another un-sponsored cease-fire left borders unchanged, but Pakistan's vulnerability had again been exposed
 The 1965 indo-pak war lasted barely a month
 Pakistan made gains in the Rajasthan desert but its main push against India's jammu-srinagar road link was repulsed and Indian tanks advanced to within a sight of Lahore
 Both sides claimed victory but India had most to celebrate
 Again India appeared, logistically at least, to be in a superior position but neither side was able to mobilize enough strength to gain a decisive victory
 By just the end of the week, in fact, it was clear that the Pakistanis were more than holding their own

 The Soviet Union, led by Premier Alexi Kossian, hosted a ceasefire talks in Tashkent, where Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistani President Ayub Khan signed the Tashkent Agreement, withdrawing forces from 25 February 1966 onwards in pre-august Agreed to
 With declining stockpiles of ammunition, Pakistani leaders feared the war tilting in India's favor
 Therefore, they quickly accepted the ceasefire in Tashkent
 Despite strong opposition from Indian military leaders, bharat budged to growing international diplomatic pressure and accepted the ceasefire
 On September 22, the sanyukt raashtra Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that called for an unconditional ceasefire from both nations
 The war ended the following day
 India's Prime Minister, Shastri, suffered a fatal heart attack soon after the declaration of the ceasefire
 As a consequence, the public outcry in India against the ceasefire declaration transformed into a wave of sympathy for the ruling Indian National Congress
 The ceasefire was criticized by many Pakistanis who, relying on fabricated official reports and the controlled Pakistani press, believed that the leadership had surrendered military gains
 The protests led to student riots
 Pakistan State's reports had suggested that their military was performing admirably in the war - which they incorrectly blamed as being initiated by India - and thus the Tashkent Declaration was seen as having forfeited the gains
 Some recent books written by Pakistani authors, including one by ex-isi chief titled "the Myth of 1965 Victory", India and Pakistan accused each other of ceasefire violations; India charged Pakistan with 585 violations in 34 days, while Pakistan countered with accusations of 450 incidents by India
 In addition to the expected exchange of small arms and artillery fire, bharat reported that Pakistan utilized the ceasefire to capture the Indian village of Chananwalla in the Fazilka sector
 This village was recaptured by Indian troops on 25 December
 On October 10, a B-57 Canberra on loan to the PAF was damaged by 3 SA-2 missiles fired from the IAF base at Ambala
 a Pakistani Army Auster was shot down on 16 disambar killing one Pakistani army captain and on 2 farvari 1967, an AOP was shot down by IAF Hunters
 The ceasefire remained in effect until the start of the indo-pakistani War of 1971
 bharat or pakistan donon kii taraf se hui kai ranneetik galatiyon ke kaaran yah yuddh benatija si sthiti main aa pahunchaa
 Indian military intelligence gave no warning of the impending Pakistan invasion
 The Indian Army failed to recognize the presence of heavy Pakistani artillery and armaments in Chumb and suffered significant losses as a result
 The "official History of the 1965 War", drafted by the Ministry of Defence of India in 1992, was a long suppressed document that revealed other miscalculations
 According to the document, on September 22 when the Security Council was pressing for a ceasefire, the Indian Prime Minister asked commanding Gen
 Chaudhuri if India could possibly win the war, were he to delay accepting the ceasefire
 The general replied that most of India's frontline ammunition had been used up and the Indian Army had suffered considerable tank losses
 It was determined later that only 14% of India's frontline ammunition had been fired and India held twice the number of tanks as Pakistan
 By this time, the Pakistani Army had used close to 80% of its ammunition
 Air Chief Marshal PC Lal, who was the Vice Chief of Air Staff during the conflict, points to the lack of coordination between the IAF and the Indian Army
 Neither side revealed its battle plans to the other
 The battle plans drafted by the Ministry of Defense and General Chaudhari, did not specify a role for the Indian Air Force in the order of battle
 This attitude of Gen
 Chaudhari was referred to by ACM Lal as the "supremo Syndrome", a patronizing attitude sometimes held by the Indian Army towards the other branches of the Indian Military
 The Pakistani Army's failures started with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people, given the opportunity provided by the Pakistani advance, would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive surrender of Kashmir
 The Kashmiri people, however, did not revolt
 Instead, the Indian Army was provided with enough information to learn of Operation Gibraltar and the fact that the Army was battling not insurgents, as they had initially supposed, but Pakistani Army regulars
 The Pakistani Army also failed to recognize that the Indian policy makers would order an attack on the southern sector in order to open a second theater of conflict
 Pakistan was forced to dedicate troops to the southern sector to protect Sialkot and Lahore instead using them to support penetrating into Kashmir
 "operation Grand Slam", which was launched by Pakistan to capture Akhnoor, a town north-east of Jammu and a key region for communications between Kashmir and the rest of India, was also a failure
 Many Pakistani commentators criticized the Ayub Khan administration for being indecisive during Operation Grand Slam
 These critics claim that the operation failed because Ayub Khan knew the importance of Akhnur to India and did not want to capture it and drive the two nations into an all-out war
 Despite progress being made in Akhnur, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik and replaced him with Gen
 Yahya Khan
 a 24-hour lull ensued the replacement, which allowed the Indian army to regroup in Akhnur and successfully oppose a lackluster attack headed by General Yahya Khan
 "the enemy came to our rescue", asserted the Indian Chief of Staff of the Western Command
 Later, Akhtar Hussain Malik criticized Ayub Khan for planning Operation Gibraltar, which was doomed to fail, and for relieving him of his command at a crucial moment in the war
 Malik threatened to expose the truth about the war and the army's failure, but later dropped the idea for fear of being banned
 Some authors have noted that Pakistan might have been emboldened by a war game - conducted in March 1965, at the Institute of Defense Analysis, USA
 The exercise awaited that, in the event of a war with India, Pakistan would win
 Other authors like Stephen Philip Cohen, have consistently commented that the Pakistan Army had "acquired an exaggerated view of the weakness of both India and the Indian military 


 the 1965 war was a shock"
 Pakistani air marshall va commander in chif of PAF during the war, nur khan, later said thgnf fhfhfffhn Army, and not India, should be blamed for starting the war
 However propaganda in Pakistan about the war continued; the war was not rationally analyzed in Pakistan, with most of the blame being heaped on the leadership and little importance given to intelligence failures that persisted until the debacle of the 1971 war, when then East Pakistan was invaded by India and seceded from West Pakistan, leading to the creation of Bangladesh
 hghginj u xxrep 4 j fhffuhhh Pakistan and the United States had signed an Agreement of Cooperation in 1959 under which the United States agreed to take "appropriate action, including the use of armed forces" in order to assist the Government of Pakistan at its request
 However, following the start of the 1965 war, the United States was of the view that the conflict was largely Pakistan's fault and therefore, it cut all military supplies to the country
 However, Pakistan did receive significant support from Iran, Indonesia and People's Republic of China
 Both before and during the war, the People's Republic of China had been a major military associate of Pakistan and had invariably admonished India, with whom it had fought a war in 1962
 There were also reports of Chinese troop movements on the Indian border to support Pakistan
 As such, bharat agreed to the UN mandate in order to avoid a war on both borders
 India's participation in the non-aligned Movement yielded little support from its members
 Despite close relations between with India, the Soviet Union was more neutral than most other nations during the war and even invited both nations to talks that it would host in Tashkent
 Despite the declaration of a ceasefire, bharat was perceived as the victor due to its success in halting the Pakistan-backed insurgency in Kashmir
 In its October 1965 issue, the TIME magazine quoted a Western official assessing the consequences of the war — Now it's obvious to everybody that India is going to emerge as an Asian power in its own right
 In light of the failures of the sino-indian War, the outcome of the 1965 war was viewed as a "politico-strategic" victory in India
 The Indian premier, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was hailed as a national hero in India
 While the overall performance of the Indian military was praised, military leaders were criticized for their failure to effectively deploy India's superior armed forces so as to achieve a decisive victory over Pakistan
 In his book "war in the modern world since 1815", noted war historian Jeremy Black said that though Pakistan "lost heavily" during the 1965 war, India's hasty decision to call for negotiations prevented further substantial damage to the Pakistan Armed Forces
 He elaborates - India's chief of army staff urged negotiations on the ground that they were running out ammunition and their number of tanks had become seriously depleted
 In fact, the army had used less than 15% of its ammunition compared to Pakistan, which had consumed closer to 80 percent and India had double the number of serviceable tanks
 As a consequence, India focussed on enhancing communication and coordination within and among the triservices of the Indian Armed Forces
 Partly as a result of the inefficient information gathering preceding the war, India established the Research and Analysis Wing for external espionage and intelligence
 Major improvements were also made in command and control to address various shortcomings and the positive impact of these changes was clearly visible during the indo-pakistani War of 1971 when India achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan within two weeks
 China's repeated threats to intervene in the conflict in support of Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision to develop nuclear weapons
 Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict which irked India
 At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India
 These developments led to a significant change in India's foreign policy — India, which had previously championed the cause of non-alignment, distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union
 By the end of 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India
 From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India's arms imports were from the Soviet Union
 After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far
 At the conclusion of the war, many Pakistanis considered the performance of their military to be positive
 September 6 is celebrated as 'defense Day' in Pakistan, in commemoration of the successful defense of Lahore against the Indian Army
 The performance of the Pakistani Air Force, in particular, was praised
 However, the Pakistani government was accused by foreign analysts of spreading disinformation among its citizens regarding the actual consequences of the war
 In his book "mainsprings of Indian and Pakistani foreign policies", S
M
 Burke writes — After the indo-pakistani war of 1965 the balance of military power had decisively shifted in favor of India
 Pakistan had found it difficult to replace the heavy equipment lost during that conflict while her adversary, despite her economic and political problems, had been determinedly building up her strength
 Most observers agree that the myth of a mobile, hard hitting Pakistan Army was badly dented in the war, as critical breakthroughs were not made
 Several Pakistani writers criticized the military's ill-founded belief that their "martial race" of soldiers could defeat "hindu India" in the war
 Rasul Bux Rais, a Pakistani political analyst wrote – The 1965 war with India proved that Pakistan could neither break the formidable Indian defenses in a blitzkrieg fashion nor could she sustain an all-out conflict for long
 Moreover, Pakistan had lost more ground than it had gained during the war and, more importantly, failed to achieve its goal of occupying Kashmir; this result has been viewed by many impartial observers as a defeat for Pakistan
 Many high ranking Pakistani officials and military experts later criticized the faulty planning of Operation Gibraltar that ultimately led to the war
 The Tashkent declaration was also criticized in Pakistan, though few citizens realized the gravity of the situation that existed at the end of the war
 Political leaders were also criticized
 Following the advice of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's foreign minister, Ayub Khan had raised very high expectations among the people of Pakistan about the superiority - if not invincibility - of its armed forces, but Pakistan's inability to attain its military aims during the war, created a political liability for Ayub
 The defeat of its Kashmiri ambitions in the war led to the army's invincibility being challenged by an increasingly vocal opposition
 One of the most far reaching consequences of the war was the wide-scale economic slowdown in Pakistan
 The cost of the 1965 war put an end to the impressive period economic growth Pakistan had experienced during early 1960s
 Between 1964 and 1966, Pakistan's defence spending rose from 4
82% to 9
86% of GDP, putting tremendous strain on Pakistan's economy
 By 1970–71, defence spending comprised a whopping 55
66% of government expenditure
 Pakistan was surprised by the lack of support by the United States, an ally with whom the country had signed an Agreement of Cooperation
 USA declared its neutrality in the war by cutting off military supplies to both sides, leading Islamabad to believe that they were "betrayed" by the United States
 After the war, Pakistan would increasingly look towards China as a major source of military hardware and political support
 Another negative consequence of the war was the growing resentment against the Pakistani government in East Pakistan, particularly for West Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir
 Bengali leaders accused the central government of not providing adequate security for East Pakistan during the conflict, even though large sums of money were taken from the east to finance the war for Kashmir
 In fact, despite some Pakistan Air Force attacks being launched from bases in East Pakistan during the war, bharat did not retaliate in that sector, although East Pakistan was defended only by an understrenghted infantry division, sixteen planes and no tanks
 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was critical of the disparity in military resources deployed in East and West Pakistan, calling for greater autonomy for East Pakistan, which ultimately led to the Bangladesh Liberation war and another war between India and Pakistan in 1971

 ek baat jo bachche ke jivan ko bado se alag karti he vah he uskaa samaaj, parivesh va prakruti ke prati vaigyanik drushtikon jo har bachche main hota he
 That is why the child turns things, moral precepts, events in reverse and does not accept anything like the ultimate truth as the elders usually do

 Thermodynamics is the electricity that begins to flow in the circuit of these wires on heating of two dissimilar metals
 is tathy ko sarvapratham sibek ne san 1821 main taanbe evam bismuth ke taron kii sandhi ko garm kar avishkrut kiya
 The electrical force produced in the above circuit is low and its intensity depends on the following things- vidyudvahak bal ko maapne ke liye asmaan dhaatuon ke taron ke thande sire vibhavamaapi se jod die jate hai
 If another metal wire is graded in the circuit, the thermal effects do not change
 yadi sibek vidyudvahak bal kaa pariman evam thandhi sandhi kaa tapantar or yadi ek sandhi kaa taap shunya degree celsius ho to e or t kaa sambandh nimnlikhit sutara main gyaat kiya jaataa he: Where a and b are thermodynamic constants and their value depends on the metal of the circuit wires
 dhaatuon ke tapavidyut sthiraank nimnlikhit sarini main die gaye he: The e = 45 t + 0
25T ^ 2 microvolt for the combination of bismuth and copper
 nunetaap par, kaa lagbhag samaanupati hota he, kintu yadi bahut adhik ho to kaa maan bad jaataa he
 The e = 158 t - 0
0285T2 microvolt of iron and copper bond is
 jab taap t = 275 celsisy ho, tab adhiktam e = 2,000 microvolt
 At high temperature the value of e starts decreasing and 5500 c degree it becomes zero 5500 C
 The direction of change is increased when the temperature increases, and the current starts flowing in the opposite direction
 is prakaar taap badhane par vidyut dhara kaa vipareet disha main pravaahit hona tapavidyutpravaah kaa utkraman kehalaata he or 550 degree celsius utkraman taap
 The treaty of copper and bismuth does not have this effect
 kinhin do taron kii sandhi kaa taap 10 celsius badhane par vidyut ke vidyudvahak bal main parivartan hota he, jise tapavidyut shakti kehete hai
 To compare the thermodynamic properties of different metals, one takes a wire of sis and another for a metal whose properties have to be determined
 tapavidyut prabhaav kaa adhik upyog taap maapne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The system of hot and frosty joint to measure the temperature is called temperature pair
 tanba or kanstaton yugma 500 celsius
 tak taap maapne ke liye tathaa platinum or rhodium evam platinum kii mishradhatu ke yugma 1500 degree celsius tak taap maapne ke achche yugma hai
 In 1834, Peltje discovered that when a current flows through a circuit of two dissimilar metals, one joint is heated and the other one is cold
 jab vidyut dhara lohe se taanbe kii or pravaahit hoti he to keshika nalee main tel kii ek buund bain ore chalakar taapan prabhaav dikhaati he or jab taanbe se lohe kii ore prabhavit hoti he tab shitalan prabhaav dikhaati he
 The Peltje effect is the reverse of the Seebeck effect
 san 1854 main wiliam tomson ne avishkrut kiya ki ek hi dhaatu ke taron ke donon siron ke madhya main vibhavantar hota he, yadi donon siron ke taap bhinn hon
 The Peltje and Thomson effects are of theoretical importance only
 inkaa vyaavhaarik mahatv kam he
 When a circuit has multiple heating pairs and their successive joints are alternately hot and cold, the total electronegative force is equal to the sum of the electronegative forces of all the heating pairs in the circuit

 Numerous attempts have been made to generate electricity by thermodynamic combinations in terms of commercial utility, but when these efforts were partially successful, it was found that their commercial value was negligible
 tapavidyut sangyojan dwaara vyapaarik drushti se vidyut utpann karne main do prakaar kii kathinaaiyaan hai: saidhantik env sanrachanaatmak
 To achieve sufficient electronegative force, a lot of combinations are required and experience has proved that a more complex thermometer is not durable
 yadi is kathinaayee ko dur bhi kar diya jaay to saidhantik kaaran, jo ooshmaagatiki par nirbhar karte hai, yah batalaate hai ki ooshmaa urja ko vidyut urja main parivartit karanevaale taapapunj kii dakshata kabhi bhi ucch nahin hoti

 a partial or complete solid-solution of two or more metallic elements is called a mishratu or alloy
 ispaat ek mishra dhaatu he
 Often the properties of alloys differ from the properties of the components that make up that alloy
 ispaat, lohe kii apeksha adhik majboot hota he
 Mishratu is bronze, brass, stitch etc
 mishradhatu vyapak rup main ek aisa shabd he jiskaa prayog kisi bhi dhatvik vastu ke liye hota he, basharte vah rasinic tatv na ho
 The art of alloying is very ancient
 satya to yah he ki kaanse kaa mahatv ek yug main itnaa adhik tha ki maanav sabhyataa ke vikaas ke us yug kaa naam hi 'kaansya yug' pad gaya he
 Although pure metals have many useful properties, such as the conductivity of heat and electricity, pure metals are not commonly used in mechanical and manufacturing operations, because they do not have the necessary strength
 dhaatu ko adhik majboot banane kii sabase mahatvapurn vidhi dhaatumishran he
 a lot of effort was made in this direction in the 19th century, the result of this is that more than five thousand alloys are available for many useful works today and new innovations are being done constantly to prepare new alloys
 aaj kisi vishesh upyog ke liye icchit gunonvali mishradhatuen banaai jaati he
 When metals dissolve in a common solution, such as an acid, they give off their metallic properties and normally form salts, but when melted they dissolve along with their metallic properties
 dhaatuon ke aise thos vilyan ko mishradhatu kehete hai
 Non-metals are also small in many alloys, but the quality of the whole remains metallic
 at: 1939 i0 main america vastu pareekshak parishad ne mishradhatu kii nimnlikhit paribhaasha kii- Initially, the alloy was used most for making coins and ornaments
 taanbe ke sikkon main tanba, tin or jasta kramash: 95 / 4 tathaa 1 pratishat rahete hai
 Until 1920, silver coins in England were made of 'sterling' silver, with silver and copper being 92
5 and 7
5 percent respectively
 america main chaandi ke sabhi sikkon main chaandi or tanba kramash: 90 tathaa 10 pratishat hote hai
 Gold and copper in England's gold coins are 91
67 and 8
33 percent respectively, and gold coins in the United States are 90 percent gold and other metals, especially copper

 Determining whether alloys are simple mixtures or chemical compounds is a complex problem
 kuch arthon main ye rasinic yogic hai, kyonki jab sodium saras banaaya jaataa he, tab sodium ke har ek tukade ko paar main daalane se prakaash kii teevr jwaala nikalati he or paara garam ho jaataa he, yah yogic banane kaa lakshan he
 Similarly, when a piece of aluminum metal is added to the melting gold, so much heat is generated that the entire molten metal becomes brighter
 anek mishra dhaatuon kaa rang apane avyav dhaatuon ke rangon se bilkul bhinn hota he
 For example, both silver and zinc are white, but the alloy they make is very beautiful pink
 sona pilaa or aluminium shwet hota he, kintu inaki mishradhatu kaa rang ati chamkila nillohit hota he
 This property also has compounds
 mishradhaatuon ke galnaank nikaalane par gyaat hua he ki mishra dhaatuon kaa vyavhaar do prakaar kaa he: kuch mishradhaatuon kaa galnaank jaise jaise kisi avyav dhaatu kii maatra badalati hai vaise-vaise badalata he, yah mishran kaa gun he or kuch mishradhaatuon kaa galnaank ek sthir taap hota he, jo prakat karata he ki mishradhatuen yogic hai
 The physical and chemical properties of alloys differ from the properties of their constituent metals, and the properties of alloys are by no means comparable to the properties of element metals
 yah bhinnata is kaaran se he ki jab dhaatuon ko ek saath pighalaate hai, tab ve kitne hi antaradhaatuk yogic tathaa thos vilyan banaati hai
 The density of an alloy can be less or greater than the mean density of its constituent metals
 kuch mishradhaatuon kaa rang apni avyav dhaatuon ke rangon se bilkul hi bhinn hota he
 They are harder than their constituent metals, but less flexible and malleable and more brittle
 mishradhaatuon kaa galnaank sarvada adhiktam taap par pighalanevaali avyavdhaatu ke galnaank se bhi kam hota he
 And usually at a minimum temperature the melting element is less than the melting point of the metal
 udaahranarth, ek mishradhatu, jisamen sisa, tin, bismuth tathaa cadmium hai, 75 ̊sein0 par galati he, jab ki nunatam taap par pighalane vaali avyav-dhaatu, tin kaa galnaank 232 ̊ sein0 he
 All these are the properties due to which alloys become more valuable than pure metals and prove more useful in industry
 upar varnit falon dwaara tathaa sookshmdarshi, eks-kiran varnakram maapi, ooshmiya tathaa rasinic vishleshan or duusare bhautik pareekshanon dwaara mishradhaaton ke sanghathan tathaa crystalia rachana ke vistrut adhyayan ke parinamswaroop, mishradhaatuon ko teen shreniyon main rakhaa gaya he
 This division has been done on the basis of how the group of atoms of the constituent metals in the alloys is organized
 ye teen shreniyan nimnlikhit hai: In these types of alloys, when the element metals are molten, they dissolve in each other, but when solid, the crystals of the metals break apart, that is, the metals are insoluble
 is prakaar mishradhatu prayek avyav dhaatu ke shuddh crystal kaa mishran hoti he or thanda karne par koi ek avyav dhaatu thos rup main pruthak ho jaati he
 For example, a liquid alloy consisting of only 10 parts lead and 90 parts tin, when cooled, pure tin crystals are first separated in the same way as pure ice crystals cooled from a dilute solution of sugar
 Are separate jis taap par tin ke crystal pruthak hona prarambh karte he, vah taap shuddh tin ke galnaank se kam hota he
 When the melting point of the tin is dissolved in the lead, the molecular weight of the lead is determined by the same rule by which the molecules of the dissolved substances in the water are removed
 is vidhi se un kai dhaatuon kaa anubhaar nikaala gaya he, jo tanughatvik vilyan main alag parmaanu ke rup main rahati he
 Lead-antimony alloys belong to the mixture category
 antimony bhangur hota he or sisa mulaayam
 The printing metal is a alloy of CC, antimony and a very small amount of tin
 is mishradhatu main antimony kii kathorta to hoti he, kintu yah uski tarah bhangur nahin hoti
 In this type of alloys, the atoms of one element metal fit well in the crystalline structure of the other element metal
 thos vilyan shrenee kii mishradhatuen do bhinn prakaar kii hoti he: Many copper-nickel alloys that have significant use fall under the category of solid solutions
 udaahranarth, ve mishradhatuen jinase nikal ke sikke, rifl kii goliyon kii tapiyaan or ek taar jiskaa vaidyut pratirodh adhik hota he, banataa he
 Many of the Canadian minerals contain copper and nickel sulfides, which are smelted to form an alloy

 This alloy is called monel metal
 yah adhik tanya, lacheelee tathaa sanksharan pratirohak hoti he
 Generally, metals do not form compounds by mixing with each other, but by heat analysis it has been found that metals combine with each other to form a large number of compounds
 in yogicon kaa vargeey naam antaradhaatuk yogic he
 Most compounds of this type form alkali and alkaline clay metals, by combining them with the metals of the odd subclass of the periodic table
 in yogicon main dhaatuen kis maatra main mili hui hai, isko rasinic sutron dwaara darshaate hai
 It is known from the study of these formulas that these types of compounds violate all the laws of valency that are formed by the compounds formed by the combination of metals and non-metals
 udaahranarth, sodium, tin or sisa ke saath rasinic kriya kar nimnlikhit yogic banaata he : Many interstitial compounds are very stable and do not dissolve their constituents in metals even when heated to temperatures higher than their melting point
 ye yogic taral ammonia main ghulte hai or is prakaar se jo vilyan taiyaar hota he, vah vaidyut chaalak hota he
 When they are electrically decomposed, then an element metal, which is less positive than the other, accumulates on the positive and the other on the minuscule
 antaradhaatuk yogic kyon banaata he, isaki abhi tak saidhantik vyakhya nahin hui
 Only so far it has been proved that those metals, which have the same properties, do not coincide with each other
 chunki is prakaar kii mishradhatuen kathor, bhangur, bahut hi kam tanyashil tathaa lacheelee hoti hai, at: inamen se keval kuch hi upyogi hai

 Multiplying the radiated power by an object by the surface area, a { \ displaystyle A}: steffon volzamaan seemaa ke baahar adhidhaatu banaai ja sakati hai
 This rule was formulated in 1879 on the basis of experimental tests made by Joseph Steffon by John Tyndall and Ludwig Boltzmann made a theoretical analysis in 1884 using thermodynamics
 steffon ne apane niyam kii sahaayta se surya kaa prishthiya taap gyaat kiya
 He found from the data of Charles Soret that the density of energy from the sun is 29 times greater than the plate heated to a certain temperature
 ek gol patalika prekshan yantra se kuch duuri par is tarah se rakhaa gaya ki yah surya ke samaan kone par dikhaai de
 Soret estimated the temperature of the plate at around 1900 ° c to 2000 ° C

 Hence: jahaan l dipti he, σ steffon-bolzamaan sthiraank, r stailer trigya or t prabhavi taap he
 The same formula can also be used to find the radius of the main sequence star relative to the Sun: jahaan r ⊙ { \ displaystyle R_{ \ odot }}, saura trigya he
 With the help of the Steffon Volzmann law, astronomers easily estimate the radius of the star
 yah niyam blike hole ke ushmagatiki ke adhyayan main bhi miltaa he jise hawking vikiran ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 In the same way we can find the effective temperature TE of the Earth by equating the energy obtained from the Sun and the energy radiated from the Earth by the black body approximation

 According to this theory, organisms are thus encouraged not to repeat situations that have caused them some kind of anguish in the past
 The experience of bliss is subjective and each person experiences pleasures of different types and quantities in the same situation

 "he then gives the following example:" The more hungry a person is, the deeper his or her enjoyment of food will be
 "he has also argued that" satisfaction of pleasure is in proportion to the need and desire of the organism

 He said that human needs and desires are infinite and "by definition its satisfaction is impossible"
 In the 19th century, the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer considered pleasurable feelings as negative sensations because it condones suffering which is a universal condition
 upyogetavaad or premawad vah darshan hai jo anand kii adhiktam vruddhi or pidaa ko kam se kam karne par samarthan karte hai
 Some examples of such philosophies are found in Freud's theory of human inspiration - called psychological hedonism; According to his observation, the instinctive nature of human beings is essentially an attempt to achieve luxury

 is par vivaad rahaa he ki sukh kii anubhuti kaa ehsaas duusare pashu bhi karte hai yaa yah sarvatha maanav jati kaa hi gundharm he
 Jeremy Bentham and Beth Dixon, on the other hand, agree with this argument, though he says it cautiously
 jo log maanav apwaad main vishwaas karaten hai unka yah maananaa he kii sagunawad main, sukh sahit, kisi bhi maanviya anubhuti ko pashuon kii visheshta nahin mana ja saktaa he
 Others see animal behavior simply as a reaction to stimulus
 vyavhaar kaa adhyan karne vaale log bhi, pramaan swarup, pawalov ke kutton ko sabase prasiddh udahaaran maanate hai
 However, it can be argued that we do not know whether animals can experience bliss or not, and most scientists want to remain neutral and use virtue as needed
 aisa prathit hota he, ki pashuon kii bhaawanaaon ko manyata dene waalon kii sankhya bad rahi he: kai athologist jaise mark bekoff is nishkarsh par pahunche hai ki pashu bhi bhaavana kii anubhuti karte hai haalanki yah jaruri nahin he ki unka anubhav maanav anubhav ke jaisaa hi ho

 Keeping this in mind, in January 2006, the Reserve Bank of India allowed banks to use service providers as middlemen to extend banking and financial services to far-flung areas called "business Facilitators" or "banking Correspondent" Correspondents , bcs)
 This was with the objective of ensuring greater financial inclusion and increasing outreach of the banking sector
 As per the current guidelines, ngos / mfis set up under Societies / Trust Acts, societies registered under Mutually Aided Cooperative Societies Acts or the Cooperative Societies Acts of States, Section 25 companies that are stand alone entities or in which nbfcs, banks, telecom companies and other corporate entities or their holding companies did not have equity holdings in excess of 10 per cent, post offices and retired bank employees, ex-servicemen and retired government employees can act as bcs of banks
 The bcs are allowed to conduct banking business as agents of the banks at places other than the bank premises
 In recent times, however, there were demands from various sectors that the eligible entities to act as bcs be enlarged, with a view to facilitating increased outreach of the banking system
 Following this, as announced in the Annual Policy 2009-10, the Reserve Bank constituted a working group to review the Business Correspondent Model
 The Working Group included officials from select commercial banks and the Reserve Bank as members and Shri P
 Vijaya Bhaskar, CGM in-charge, Department of Banking Operations and Developments as the Chairman
