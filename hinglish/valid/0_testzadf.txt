 Most studies suggest that menarche may occur earlier in girls in high stress homes whose fathers were absent in their early childhood, or who had a stepfather in their homes, or who have been sexually abused for long periods of childhood
 , Or who have been adopted at an early age from developing countries
 iske vipareet, un ladakiyon main minarche kuch der se prakat ho saktaa he jo bade parivaar main jaivik pita ke saath vruddhi karti hai
 Unbearable limits to environmental stress, such as wartime refugee conditions that threaten physical security, have been found to be associated with delayed maturation, an effect that may be complicated by dietary insufficiency
 in tathakthith saamaajik prabhaavon main se adhikansh chote hai or hamaare dwaara puri tarah se samajhe nahin ja sake hai
 Most of the "effects" are in the form of statistics revealed by surveys conducted during the epidemic
 sankhyikeey sanghathan jaruri tathy nahin hai or vibhinn prakaaron ke parivartanon or vaikalpik spashtikarnon kii kalpana kii ja sakati he
 It is never possible to confirm or deny the impact that such a small amount has on any young child

 Allegations of discrimination based on political agendas are sometimes accompanied by scientific criticism

 More information is given in the Menarche article
 yuvavastha ke vikaas kii ghatnaon ke anukram main kabhi-kabhi antar ho saktaa he
 For example, in 15% of boys and girls, pubarche may occur a few months earlier than gonadarche and thelarche, respectively
 shaayad hi kabhi, kuch ek ladakiyon main yuvavastha ke duusare lakshan dikhaai dene se pehle minarche ghatit hota he
 These changes deserve medical evaluation because they sometimes indicate a disease
 ek saamaanya arth main, yuvavastha kaa samaapan prajnan paripakvata he
 The criteria for defining the findings may be different for different reasons such as attainment of fertility, attainment of height of maximum adult, maximum size of genitals or level of adult sex hormones
 ausatan ek ladki 15 saal kii ausat umr main tathaa ladkaa 18 saal kii ausat umr main apni adhiktam vayask oonchai praapt kar lete hai
 Potential fertility usually precedes completion of 1-2 years in girls and 3-4 years of development in boys
 charan 5 aam taur par jananaangon or or vayask hormone staron ke adhiktam vikaas kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 The endosyrene reproductive system consists of the hypothalamus, pituitary, genitalia, and adrenal glands, along with reactions and regulation of many other physiological systems
 vaastavik yuvavastha ko "kendriya yuvavastha" kaha jaataa he kyonki yah kendriya tantrika pranali ke prakriya ke kaaran shuru hoti he
 a simple description of hormonal puberty is as follows: is neurohormonal prakriya kii shuruyaat pehle pratyaksh shaareerik parivartan se 1-2 saal pehle ho sakati he
 The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus is the operator of the reproductive system
 isamen neuron hote hai jo piyush granthi ke portal vinos pranali main jienarech kii indriyon ko utpann karte hai
 The arcuate nucleus is affected and controlled by the responses of nerves to other parts of the brain and hormones derived from the genitals, adipose tissues, and a variety of other systems
 piyush granthi rakt ke saamaanya pravaah main, ek spandit pattern main alech va enne ko chhod kar spandit jienarech ke prati prakriya karti he
 The genital, testosterone, and estrogen steroids respond to increased levels of LH and FSH by producing sex hormones
 adrenal granthiyaan steroid hormone ke duusare strot hai
 Adrenal maturation, called adrenarche, typically precedes gonadarche in the middle of childhood
 bhrun jivan ke pratham timahi ke ant tak antahsravi prajnan pranali kaaryaatmak ho jaati he
 The testes and ovaries remain inactive for some time at birth but resume hormonal activity several months after birth, when the brain's incomprehensible mechanism stops the process of the arcuate nucleus
 ise yuvavastha-purv "gonadostate" kii paripakvata ke rup main sanderbhit kiya gaya he, jo sex steroid dwaara nakaaratmak pratikriya ke liye samvedansheel ho jaataa he
 After a period of hormonal activity several months after birth, the stopping process begins which may correspond to the sexuality of the infant, followed by a latency phase, described by Sigmund Freud
 gonodotrophin or sex steroid kaa str bachapan ke lagbhag 8 se 10 saalon ke liye neeche girtaa he 
 is baat ke sakshya badhate ja rahe hai ki bachapan ke varshon main prajnan pranali puri tarah se niskriy nahin hoti
 gonodotrophin indriyon main maamuli vruddhi hoti he or germ koshikaon ke aasapaas dembugranthi kosh main bhavishya main banane vaale andey sankhya main dogune ho jate hai
 Normal puberty in the hypothalamus begins with the inhibition of the pulse generator in the arcuate nucleus
 arcuat nabhik kaa yah nishedh mastishk ke anya kshetron dwaara jari ek sakriy avrodh he
 Signals and mechanisms that exclude the arcuate nucleus from inhibition have been the subject of investigation for decades and are not fully understood
 puure bachapan ke dauraan leptin kaa str badhata rahata he or arcuat nabhik ko prakriya ke liye anumati detaa he
 If the development of the arcuate nucleus in childhood is interrupted prematurely due to brain injury, it can conduct the gonadotrophin senses which will initiate the process of puberty before age
 arcuat nabhik ke neurons pituitary portal pranali ke rakt main gonadotropin chhodane vaale hormone ) kaa srav karte hai
 An American physiologist, Ernst Knobil, found that gnrh signals from the hypothalamus induce the secretion of the pulse (LH) to the pulse at intervals of approximately 1–2 hours
 LH nasen arcuat nabhik ke fadakane se hue gnrh srav ke kaaran banati hai, jo khud, kendriya mastishk pranali ke sanketon yaa sanket utpaadak kii utpann kanpakanpahat se bana he
 Robert M
 Boyer found that gonadotrophin senses burst only in the nid during the first years of physical puberty, but they can be detected by the day they reach puberty
 yuvavastha ke ant tak, gonodotrophin indriyon kii tivrata or aavruti main din va raat ke samay thodaa hi antar hota he
 Some investigators have attributed the resonance of shivering in the brain to the onset of puberty
 is hisaab se, yuvavastha se kuch samay pehle raat main fadakati jananaangon kii indriyaan is kathan kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai
 The group of "self-accelerating processes" increases the amount of hormones responsible for adolescence in the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and genitals
 adrenarche kaa viniman or hypothelemic jananaangon kii paripakvata se iske sambandh ko abhi puri tarah se samajha nahin ja sakaa he or kuch saakshyon ke anusaar yah yuvavastha ke samanaantar yaa isse aage chalane vaali ek badi swatantra prakriya he
 Rising levels of adrenal androgens can be identified between 6 and 11 years of age, even before the growth of the genital veins of hypothalamic puberty
 adrenal androgen donon lingon main guptang ke baalo, vayask sharir gandh evam anya androgenic parivartanon ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai
 The primary medical significance of the difference between adrenarche and gonadarche is that these changes such as the hair and body odor of the genitals do not prove that a child is undergoing puberty
 naron main hypothelemic paripakvata ke praarambhik charan bahut had tak maadaa yuvavastha ke praarambhik charnon ke samaan prathit hote hai, yadhyapi ye unase 1-2 saal baad hote hai
 lhs stimulate the testicular cells of the testes to produce testosterone and blood levels begin to rise
 yuvavastha ke adhikansh samay tak, testosterone kaa raat kaa str din ke str se adhik hota he
 Males have less need for regularity and intensity of increase in reproductive veins than in puberty of females
 haalanki, kishor ladakon main testosterone kaa ek mahatvapurn bhaag estrodeol main badal jaataa he
 Estradiol is responsible for growth spurt, bone maturation and closure of epiphysal in boys like girls
 estrodeol ladakon main ek bade anupaat main stan utak ke vikaas ko bhi prerit karata he
 In boys, when puberty causes mild gynecomastia or swollen nipples, they are told that these effects are temporary due to high levels of estradiol in some male adolescents
 adhiktar yuva purushon main nar hormonal parivartan kishoravastha ke dauraan hota he
 At this point in the life of males, testosterone levels increase gradually and most of the effects are driven through the androgen receptors as changes in the planned organs of dihydrotestosterone
 alech nabz main vruddhi hone ke saath saath, yoni kii theka koshikaayen testosterone or usase kuch kam maatra main projesterone utpann karne lagati hai
 Most testosterone is absorbed into the surrounding cells, called granulosa cells
 enne main thodi vruddhi in granulosa koshikaon kii vikaas ke liye jimmevaar aromatez gatividhiyon ko badhaati he, jo shiraaon main srav ke liye adhikansh testosterone ko estrodeol main badal dete hai
 Increased estradiol levels induce physiological changes related to estrogen characteristics in female puberty: rapid growth, increased or inhibited bone maturation, growth of breasts, increased structure of fat, growth of uterus, increased thickness of membranes and vaginal skin , And increasing the width of the lower pelvis
 jaise jaise estrodeol kaa str dhire dhire badhata he or anya swaabhaavik rup se hone vaali prakriyaaon kaa vikaas hota he, hypothelemic "gonadostate" ke kriyasheel hone kii soochna milte hi vayaskta kaa padaav praapt ho jaataa he
 This achievement of positive feedback is indicative of female sexual maturity, as it allows mid-cycle LH charge for ovulation
 yuvavastha ke dauraan adrenal androgen or testosterone ke str bhi badhate hai, jo maadaa yuvavastha main vishesh androgenic parivartanon ko utpann karte hai: guptangon ke bal, anya androgenic bal jaisaa ki upar bataaya gaya he, sharir kii gandh, munhaase
 During the entire phase of puberty, hormone levels continue to rise continuously

 Growth ends and adult height is attained after estradiol levels complete epiphyses

 aam upyog main, pratijaivik yaa antibiotic ek padaarth yaa yogic he, jo jeevanu ko maar daalata he yaa uske vikaas ko roktaa he
 There is a broad group of antibacterial antimicrobial compounds, which are used to treat infections caused by bacteria seen by microscopes, including fungi and protozoa
 "antibiotic" shabd kaa prayog 1942 main cellman voxman dwaara kisi ek sookshm jeev dwaara utpann kiye gayi thos yaa taral padaarth ke liye kiya gaya, jo ucch tanukaran main anya sookshmjivon ke vikaas ke virdohi hote hai
 This basic definition does not contain naturally occurring solids or liquids that are capable of killing bacteria, but are not produced by microorganisms, and do not contain synthetic antibacterial compounds such as sulfonamide
 kai pratijaivik apekshaakrit chote anu hote hai, jinka bhaar 2000 Da se bhi kam hota hai
 Along with the advancement of medicinal chemistry, most antibiotics are now synthetic, chemically modified from basic compounds found in nature, as in the case of betalactam
 kuch pratijaivik dawaaon kaa utpaadan abhi bhi aminoglaicosaidajaise jivit jeevon ke jariye hota he or unhen alag-thalag rakhna jaataa he or anya puri tarah kritrim tareekon- jaise salphonamides,quinolonsoroxajolidinonsase banaaye jate hai
 Antibiotics can be broadly divided into two groups according to their classification based on origin - their effect on microorganisms in addition to natural, semisynthetic and synthetic: one, which kills bacteria, is called bactericidal agent and Those that impair the growth of bacteria are called bacteriostatic agents

 Interest in Fleming's work took place after the discovery of another natural antibiotic that was discovered by Brevis and named Germicidin
 In 1939, Rene Dubos received distinct recognition of germicidin as the first commercially produced antibiotic used in the treatment of wounds and ulcers during World War II
 Florey and Chan succeeded in purifying penicillin
 This purified antibiotic demonstrated antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria
 isamen vishaaktata bhi kam thi or pratikul prabhaav paidaa kiye bina inhen liya ja saktaa tha
 Furthermore, its activity was not inhibited by biological components such as pus, as was the case with the use of synthetic antibiotic sulfonamide available at the time

 The development of penicillin aroused renewed interest in the discovery of antibiotic compounds with similar capacities
 His discovery of penicillin led to the joint Nobel Prize in 1945 to Ernst Chen, Howard Florey

 Evaluation of the activities of an antibiotic is important for the successful outcome of antimicrobial therapy

 Basically, the classification of antibiotics can be such that those that take lethal or bactericidal action against bacteria, or those that are bacteriostatic, whose function is to inhibit bacterial growth
 pratijaivik dawaaon kii jeevanunashak gatividhi unke charanbaddh vikaas par nirbhar he or sabhi nahin, lekin zyaadaatar maamalon main dawa kii "vinaashak" kshamta ke liye jeevanunashak pratijaivik dawaaon kii karrwai ke dauraan koshikaon ke vibhaajan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 This classification is based on the behavior observed in the laboratory; In practice, both of them are capable of eradicating a bacterial infection

 Antibiotic drugs are usually classified based on their mechanism of action, chemical composition or spectrum of activity
 adhikansh pratijaivik bacteria ke kaary yaa unki vikaas prakriya par nishaanaa sadhate hai
 Antibiotic drugs, which focus on the bacterial cell wall or cell membrane, or essential bacterial enzymes, are generally bactericidal in nature

 In the last few years, three new classes of antibiotics have been used for diagnosis
 is tarah pratijaivik yogicon ke nae virgon kii khoj main 40 saalon kaa samay laga he
 There are the following three classes of these new antibiotics: cyclic lipopeptidases, glycylcycline, and oxazolidinones
 Tegacycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, while two others are used to treat Gram-positive infections
 in ghatnaon ko vartmaan pratijaivik dawaaon kii bacteria pratirohak pratikriya maapne ke saadhan kii ummid ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Since the first major efforts by Florey and Chan in 1939, the importance of antibiotics in medicine has led to the discovery and production of research
 utpaadan kii prakriya main saamanytah sookshmjivon kii vyapak shreniyon kaa nirikshan or unka pareekshan tathaa sanshodhan shaamil hota he
 Production is done through fermentation, usually in a strong aerobic manner
 maukhik pratijaivik ko nigalkar liya jaataa he, jabaki nason ke jariye diye jane vaale pratijaivik or zyada gambhir maamalon, jaise gaharaai tak faile pranaligat sankramanon main istemaal kiye jate hai
 Antibiotics are also sometimes used from outside, such as eye drops or ointments
 haalanki aamtaur par pratijaivik dawaaon ko surakshit or acchhee tarah sahan karne yogya mana jaataa he, par ye vyapak rup se pratikul prabhaav se bhi judi hui hai
 The side effects are many, varied and entirely dependent on the microorganisms used and targeted
 nai dawaaon se upachaar ke suraksha profile kai varshon se upyog kii ja rahi dawaaon jitne sthapit nahin he
 Adverse effects can range from fever and nausea to major allergies such as photodermatitis and anaphylics
 aam rup se dikhne vaale dushprabhavon main se ekadast he, jo kabhi-kabhi anerobics bacterium chlostridium diphisile ke kaaran hote hai or yah pratijaivik dwaara aant ke flora ke saamaanya santulan ko astavyast karne se hota he
 Such overgrowth of disease-causing bacteria can be eliminated by taking pro-biotic supplements while taking antibiotics
 pratijaivik ke kaaran un jeevanuon kii sankhya bhi bad sakati he jo saamaanya rup se yoni ke flora ke ghatak ke rup main upasthit hote hai or isse volvon-yoni kshetra main jinas candida khamir kii prajatiyon kaa jarurat se zyada vikaas ho saktaa he
 Interactivity with other drugs may also show other side effects, such as taking a quinolone antibiotic with systemic corticosteroid increases the risk of tendon damage
 anumaan kiya jaataa he ki janm niyantran goliyon kii prabhaavashiltaa ke saath kuch pratijaivik dawaaon kaa hastkshep do tareekon se hota he
 Modification of the intestinal flora may lead to decreased absorption of estrogens
 duusare, heptic liver anzime lene se goli ke sakriy tatwon kaa chayapchayan tej hota he or isse goli kii upyogita prabhavit ho sakati hai
 However, most studies indicate that antibiotics do not interfere with the work of contraception
 haalanki kuch pratishat mahilaayein pratijaivik lene ke dauraan janm niyantran goliyon ke kam prabhaav padane kii anubhuti karti hai, jabaki asafalataa kii dar kii tulanagoli lene vaali mahilaon se kii ja sakati he
 In addition, there are no other studies that show conclusively that interruption of the abdominal flora affects contraception
 antiongal dawa greesophulvin or vyapak daayre vaale pratijaivik riffampisin dwaara yakrut anzimon ke adhishthapan ke madhyam se maukhik garbhanirodhak goli lene se aisa ho saktaa he
 It is therefore recommended that during the antimicrobial therapy using these antimicrobials additional contraceptive measures should be resorted to
 sharaab pratijaivik dawaaon kii gatividhi yaa chayapchayan main dakhal de sakati he isse yakrut anzime kii gatividhi prabhavit ho sakati he, jisase pratijaivik dawaaon kaa prabhaav khatm ho jaataa he
 In addition, some of the antibiotics such as metronidazole, tinidazole, cefamandol, catechonazole, latamoxeph, cefoprazone, cephamenoxime, and furazolidin react with, causing severe side effects, including vomiting, nausea, and shortness of breath
 isliye aise pratijaivik lene ke dauraan sharaab kaa seven nahin karnaa chahie
 iske atirikt, sharaab ke seven se kuch khaas paristhitiyon main doxiciclin or irithromicine susinet ke serum str main kami ho sakati he
 The emergence of antibiotic resistance is a developmental process based on the selection of the organism and thereby increasing the survival ability for doses of antibiotic drugs, which were previously fatal
 penicillin or irithromycin jaise pratijaivik, jo ek samay chamatkaari ilaaj maane jate the, ab kam prabhavakaari dikh rahe hai, kyonki jeevanu adhik pratirodhi ban rahe hai
 Antibiotics themselves act as selective pressures, which allow the growth of a certain number of resistant bacteria and then keep the easily destroyed bacteria alive
 1943 main luria-delbruk prayog ke jariye jeevanuon kii aabaadi ke bheetar pehle se maujuud pratijaivik pratirodhi utparivarti jeev kaa pradarshan kiya gaya
 Bacterial life is often the result of inherited resistance
 koi bhi pratijaivik pratirodh ek jaivik keemat maangata he or pratijaivik pratirodhi jeevanuon kaa prasar pratirodh ke saath ghati hui fitness se prabhavit ho saktaa he, jo khaskar pratijaivik ke maujuud nahin hone kii sthiti main bacteria ko jivit rakhane main laabhprad sabit hota he
 However, additional mutant organisms may help offset the cost of fitness and restore survival of these bacteria
 antarnihit aanvik pratirodh tantra, jisase pratijaivik pratirodh hota he, bhinn-bhinn ho saktaa he
 Basic resistance is natural due to the genetic design of the bacterium
 The bacterial chromosome may fail to encode the protein that the antibiotic targets
 hasil kiya hua pratirodh jeevanu gunasutra main parivartan yaa atirikt gunasutra diene ke adhigrahan se utpann hota he
 Antibiotic-producing bacteria are part of the immune system from simple to complex, similar in appearance and can migrate to antibiotic resistant strains
 pratijaivik pratirodh tantra kaa prasar kshaitij anuvanshik vinimay dwaara pichhali pidiyon or diene ke anuvanshik punarsangyojan se viraasat main mili parivartan ke sheersh sancharan ke madhyam se hota he
 Antibiotic resistance can be exchanged between different bacteria by the plasmid, which encodes antibacterial resistance, allowing multiple antibiotics to coexist
 ye plasmid vividh pratirodh tantra ke saath alag jin dhaaran kiye hue ho sakate hai or asambaddha pratijaivik se mil sakate hai, kyonki ve sthananantarit kiye gayi ek pratijaivik se zyada plasmid ekaadhik pratijaivik pratirodh paidaa karte hai
 Alternatively, mutual resistance to other antibiotics within the bacteria occurs when a similar resistance mechanism is responsible for resistance to more than one antibiotic chosen
 anupyukt pratijaivik upachaar or pratijaivik kaa ati prayog pratirodhi jeevanuon ke ubharne kaa ek mukhya kaarak hai
 The problem is further compounded when one starts taking antibiotics on their own without the instructions of a qualified physician and there is non-therapeutic use of antibiotics as growth promoters in agriculture
 pratijaivik dawaaon main baar-baar ye sanket diye jate hai ki kahaan inaki jarurat nahin hai, yaa upyog galat he yaa diya gaya pratijaivik maamuli asar vaala he
 It also happens in some cases where the infection can be cured without treatment
 penicillin or irithromicine jaise pratijaivik, jo ek samay chamatkaarik ilaaj maane jate the, ke atiprayog se 1950 ke dashak ke baad se inke pratirohak tatv ubharne shuru ho gayi
 The therapeutic use of antibiotics in hospitals is associated with the growth of multi-antibiotic resistant bacteria
 pratijaivik ke durupyog ke aam roopon main-yatriyon dwaraprophelatic pratijaivik kaa zyada upyog, dawa likhte samay rogi ke vajan va use pehle di gayin pratijaivik dawaaon kaa dhyaan na rakhana shaamil he, kyonki donon pratijaivik dawaaon kii prabhaavashiltaa ko nasht yahaan tak ki puure course ko vifal kar sakate hai
 Antibiotics can also fail due to lack of rest for the infected organism to recover fully, not to mention the interval of taking them while writing such antibiotics
 aisa karne se pratijaivik pratirodh ke saath jeevanuon kii aabaadi badhane main madad milegi
 anupyukt pratijaivik upachaar pratijaivik durupyog kaa ek aam rup he
 As a common example, we can take the use of antibiotics that relieve viral infections for the common cold, which has no effect on it

 chikitsakon or marijon donon kaa bahukaaryakari hastkshep pratijaivik dawaaon ke anupyukt nirdhaaran ko kam kar saktaa he
 a 48-hour delay in taking antibiotics for spontaneous diagnosis of respiratory tract infections can reduce the use of antibiotics
 lekin, yah ranneeti rogi main santosh kii bhaavana kam kar sakati he
 Many organizations concerned with antimicrobial resistance are advocating to improve the regulatory environment
 america ke interegency roganurodhi pratirodh task force kii sthapana kaa makasad pratijaivik dawaaon ke durupyog or atiprayog se jude muddon se nipatane kaa prayaas karnaa he, jiskaa makasad roganurodhi pratirodh kii samasyaon kaa sakriyata se adhyayan karnaa he
 The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and several other government agencies coordinate these issues for consideration
 ek gaiyr sarkari sanghathan abhiyaan samooh kaa naam "keep pratijaivik varking"he
 In France, a government campaign "antibiotics Are Not Automatic" has been launched since 2002, reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, especially for children
 united kingdom main, kai doctoron ke clinicon main NHS poster lagaae gaye hai, jinamein sanket kiya gaya he ki 'durbhaagya se, pratijaivik dawaaon kii kitni bhi maatra aapako cirkedi se chhutkaaraa nahin dilaa sakati, kyonki kai rogi apane doctor se khaskar anupyukt pratijaivik dene kaa anurodh karte he, is vishwaas se unhen viral sankraman ke ilaaj main madad milegi
 In agriculture, antibiotic resistance associated with the non-clinical treatment of antibiotics as growth-sponsors in animals began in the post-1970 restricted form in the UK
 vartmaan main puure europea sangh main vikaas praayojakon ke rup main pratijaivik dawaaon ke gaiyr-nidanmoolak upyog par pabandi lagi he
 It is estimated that more than 70% of the antibiotics used in the US are fed to animals without causing disease
 khaadya pashu utpaadan main pratijaivik ke upyog salmonella spp, capilobacter esapeepi, esacherichia kolai or introcucus esapeepi sahit jeevanuon ke pratirodhi prakaaron se judaa hua he
 Some American evidence and European studies indicate that these resistant bacteria cause infections in humans, which do not respond to commonly prescribed antibiotics
 In relation to these customs and associated problems, many organizations, such as the need to ban the use of antibiotics in the production of edible animals and to eliminate all non-medical use of it
 haalanki, pratijaivik dawaaon ke upyog ko simit karne ke liye viniamak or vidhaayi karrwai main deree aam he or isamen in pratijaivik kaa upyog kar rahe yaa bech rahe udyogon kaa virodh or saath-saath pratijaivik ke upyog or vishaanujanit laailaaj bimariyon ke bich aakasmik sampark banane se sambandhit anusandhan main lage udyogon kaa virodh bhi shaamil ho saktaa he
 Public health and medical organizations, including two federal bills, supported

 Research is currently being conducted on a solution for the development of drug compounds that can withstand resistance, which can reverse many antibiotic resistance
 ye tathakthith pratirodh ko sanshodhit karne vaale agent MDR tantra ko nishaanaa bana sakate hai or unhen baadhit kar sakate hai, jisase bacteria pratijaivik dawaaon se aakraant ho sakate hai, jo pehle se hi pratirodhi ke rup main maujuud the
 These compounds can target the following including others- yogicon kii pahchaan ke tulanaatmak adhyayan, jo surakshit rup se bacteria kaa sankraman thik karata he, kavak or viral sankraman ke upachaar main nakli kii pahchaan karnaa mushkil tha
 Antibiotic research led to considerable progress in the field of knowledge of biochemistry and this led to major differences between the cellular and molecular physiology of a bacterial cell and the same was with respect to the mammalian cell
 This explained the opinion that many compounds that may be toxic to bacteria are non-toxic to human cells
 iske vipareet, kavak prakoshth ke buniyadi jaev rasayan or stanpayi cell kaaphi kuch milte-julate hai
 It focuses on the development and application of therapeutic compounds to attack the fungal cell, while not harming mammalian cells
 Similar problems appear in antibiotic treatment of viral diseases

 The growth of these organisms has led to the need for alternative antibacterial treatment

 "bacteriocins" are also a growing alternative to classic small molecule antibiotics
 bacteriosins ke vibhinn virgon ke chikitsakeey agent ke rup main vibhinn tarah kii sambhaavnaaen hai
 Small molecule bacteriocins can be similar to classic antibiotics; Like colicin, there is a possibility of a more narrow spectrum of bacteriocins, which would lead to the demand for new molecular diagnostics prior to therapy and would increase the likelihood of resistance at the same level
 One drawback of large molecule antibiotics is the relative difficulty for them to cross the membrane and travel systemically throughout the body

 Shiva is the name of the last idol of the three ultimate idols of the same element, the work of Brahma is to destroy the creation, the position of Vishnu and the work of Shiva, but according to the communal Shaivas, Shiva is the ultimate element, and in addition to the destruction in their works, creation And the work of rearing is also included, Shiva is also the ultimate virtue, and he is also found to have the action of grace or prasad and tiro bhava, thus his work is five They belong to Rakar, various manifestations of Shiva are related to one or the other of these works, they are aimed at the welfare of the devotees, Shiva is also considered to be the originator of various arts and siddhis, music, dance, yoga, grammar, lectures, nepotism , Shiva is the original originator of Adi, he has been imagined as the lord of all living beings, that is why it is called Pashupati, Bhootpati, and Bhootnath, Shiva give all It's been great saying Vendors, That is why Maheshwar and Mahadev are found against them, they have the eternal power of Maya, that is why Shiva is also Mayapati, Uma is also a synonym for Shiva being Uma's husband, she has many antics and synonyms, i have a long Sahastranam The list is, the sequence of origin and development of Shiva's imagination begins to be found only in Vedic literature, in the Rigveda itself, in the imagination of Rudra, many characteristics of Shiva and mythological related The origin of the saga is included, similarly Shukla's Vajasaneyi Samhita contains the Shatrudriya text, in which the original form of Shiva is reflected, in which Shiva is said to be Girish, wearing cattle and Jata Jute Rakhen Wala, in the great glory of Rudra
 It has been told, and the religious objects found from the excavation of Bhava, Shiva, Rudra and Pashupati, Ugri, Mahadev, and Ishaan Virudas have been used for them, among them, Yogi Shiva also has Is a replica, But till now the name of Shiva as a noun is not found as an adjective only, Shiva is found as a synonym of Rudra, Shiva is also a name in many names of Rudra, and Shiva Rudra Mahadev, Ishaan among the Adi Brahmins , Adi Rudra's names are found, and in Brahmana, a viraud of Rudra is also found in Ashani, in these Atha Virudas, Rudra, Shrava, Ugra, and Ashani represent the abject form of Shiva, similarly Bhava, p
 Sushti, Mahadev, and Ishaan describe their gentle form, also mention their mangalik Virud Shambhu and Shankar, it is difficult to tell when the progress of Shiva worship was progressed, but it is so certain that the Shaiva sect was already in the east
 Had emerged, in which Shiva worshipers have been mentioned, has also said in the great language that Shiva Bhagwat used to wear Ay-shul and Dandajani, in the Puranas which included Shiva in the Puranas
 a detailed description and explanation of Shiva is found, The pure Sanskrit literature and inscriptions are full of Shiva's praises, in Puranas and later literature, Shiva is imagined as Yogiraj, his abode is Mount Kailash, he sits on the dark skin, and meditates in meditation
 , They hold the world with their meditation and tapobal, there is a jaatjuta on their head, in which the moon of the second moon is in the moon, from which the Jagatpavani Ganga flows

 Is described, It seems to have been conceived on the method of incarnations of Vishnu, often wearing Shiva incarnations for the destruction of the wicked and the examination of the devotees, etc
 The story of the marriage of shiva-parvati is also very popular in Sanskrit literature and folk literature
 Imagination of Shiva's terrible form is also found, which is related to his destructive form, he resides in the crematorium, battlefield, squares, holds the mundamala, ghosts And surrounded by the ganas, they themselves are Mahakalas, by which the Mahapralaya occurs, they have an Ardhanarishvara form, which conceives a pair shape of Shiva and Shakti, likewise the coordinated form of Shiva and Vishnu in hari-hari form
