 iske pracheen naamon main kriyalap vatsyayan dwaara nirdisht 64 kalaon main se anyatam he
 The naming "sahitya Vidya" mentioned by Rajasekhar depends on the Indian imagination of poetry, but these nomenclature could not become famous
 "alankarishastra" main alankaar shabd kaa prayog vyapak tathaa sankeern donon arthon main samajhnaa chahie
 The two meanings of the ornament are valid - vyapak arth sweekaar karne par alankarishastra kavyasobhaa ke aadhaek samast tatwon - gun, reeti, ras, vritti dhwani aadi--kaa vijaek shaastra he jisamen in tatwon ke swaroop tathaa mahatv kaa ruchir vivaran prastut kiya gaya he
 The name expresses its historical significance when taken in a narrow sense
 sahityashastra ke aarambhik yug main "alankaar" hi kavy kaa sarvasv mana jaataa tha jiske abhaav main kavy ushntahin agni ke samaan nishpraan or nirjeev hota he
 Critical analysis of "ornamentation" gave rise to the element of "quibble" on the one hand and a review of the meaning on the other gave a clear indication of the principle of "sound"
 isliye ras, dhwani, gun aadi kavyatatvon kaa pratipadak hone par bhi, alankaar praadhanya drushti ke kaaran hi, aalochanashastra kaa naam "alankarishastra" padaa or vah lokapriy bhi hua
 The achievement of ornaments, especially the metaphor, metaphor, utterance and exaggeration, is certainly found in the mantras of the Rigveda, but there is no evidence of the emergence of this scripture in the Vedic age
 nirukt ke anushilan se "upama" kaa saahitiyik vishleshan yask se purvavarti yug kii aalochana kii parinat fal prathit hota he
 Yasak has not only instructed the epithet of any ancient Acharya, he has also described the fundamental metaphor-types like Pratyapat Karmopama, Bhootopama, Roopopama, Siddhopama, Arthopama: Parasantpur: Sir
 isse spasht he ki alankaar kaa udai yask se bhi purv ho chukaa tha
 The names of Kashyapa and Varruchi, Brahmadatta and Nandiswami, Tarunavachaspati, have taken place among the adorned figures, but their texts and opinions are not known
 rajasekhar dwaara "kavyamimasaa" main nirdisht brihaspati, upamanyu, suvarnanabh, prachethayan, shesh, pulasthya, parashar, utathy aadi ashtadash aacharyon main se keval bharat kaa "naatyashaastra" hi aajkal uplabdh he
 Other Acharyas hold only imaginary power
 itnaa to nishchit he ki unani aalochana ke udai shatabdiyon purv "alankarishastra" pramanik shaastrapaddati ke rup main pratishthit ho chukaa tha
 Samudrabandha, the commentator of "alankarasarvasva", has given a beautiful account of the uniqueness of many sects of this scripture
 kavy ke vibhinn angon par mahatv tathaa bal dene se vibhinn sampradaayon kii vibhinn shatabdiyon main utpatti hui
 The number of main sects can be considered as six- in sampradaayon ne apane naam ke anusaar tattat 'kavy kii aatma' arthath mukhya praan sweekaar kiya he
 The chief Acharya of the Rasa sect is Bharata Muni who mainly analyzed the Natyaras and that description was considered authentic by the Avantar Acharyas also for the Kavyaras
 alankaar sampradaay ke pramukh acharya bhamah, dandi, udbhat tathaa rudrat hai
 In this view, ornamentation is considered to be the soul of poetry
 is shaastra ke itihaas main yahi sampradaay pracheenatam tathaa vyapak prabhaavapurn angeekrut kiya jaataa he
 The chief of the Reeti sect is Acharya Vamana, who in his "kavyalankarsutra" has considered Reeti as the soul of poetry in clear terms
 dandi ne bhi reeti ke ubhay prakaar--vaidarbhi tathaa gaudi--kii apane "kavyadarsh" main badi maarmik samiksha kii thi, parantu unki drushti main kavy main alankaar kii hi pramukhataa rahati he
 The origin of the Vakrokti sect is attributed to Acharya Kuntak, who in his "vakrokhivishiva" has accepted the "vakrokti" as the soul of poetry
 dhwani sampradaay kaa pravatrthan aanandavardhan ne apane ugantarkari granth "dhvanyalok" main kiya tathaa iskaa pratishthapan abhinav gupt ne dhvanyalok kii lochan tikaa main kiya
 Mammat, Ruyak, Hemachandra, Piyushvarsha Jayadeva, Vishwanath Kaviraj, Panditraj Jagannath - are the distinguished masters of this sect
 auchity sampradaay ke pratishthata kshemendra ne bharat, aanandavardhan aadi pracheen aacharyon ke mat ko grahan kar kavy main auchity tatv ko pramukh tatv angikaar kiya tathaa ise swatantra sampradaay ke rup main pratishthit kiya
 The rhetoric has thus been reviewing poetry for almost two thousand years
 yah shaastra atyant pracheen kaal se kavy kii samiksha or kavy kii rachana main aalochakon tathaa kaviyon kaa morganirdesh karata aayaa he
 This analysis of poetic both intimate and outmoded presents poignantly
 samikshasansar ke liye alankarishastra kii kavyatatvon kii chaar atyant mahatvapurn dein he jinka sarvang vivechan, antarang pareekshan tathaa vyaavhaarik upyog bhartiya saahitiyik manishiyon ne badi sookshmata se anek granthon main pratipaadit kiya he
 These are important poetic elements - justification, quibble, sound and rasa
 auchity kaa tatv lok vyavhaar main or kavyakala main nitant vyapak siddhant he
 On the basis of justification, the palace of Rasamimamsa stands
 aanandavardhan kii yah ukti samikshajgat main moulik tathy kaa upanyaas karti he ki anauchity ko chhodkar rasbhang kaa koi doosraa kaaran nahin he or auchity kaa upanibandhan ras kaa rahasybhoot upanishat he- Vakrokti Lokatikranta is the literary noun of the configuration of the transitional word
 vakrokti ke mahatmaya se hi koi bhi ukti kavy kii raspecial sookhti ke rup main parinat hoti he
 There is a lot of poetic touchiness to the "expressionism" quibble referred to by Crochet in Europe
 dhwani kaa tatv sanskrit aalochana kii teesri mahati dein he
 Our critics say that poetry does not reveal as much to our ears as it does, but it also has the ability to convey extremely deep meanings to our hearts
 yah sundar manoram arth "vyanjana" naamak ek vishisht shabdavyapaar ke dwaara prakat hota he or is prakaar vyanjak shabdaarth ko dhvanikavy ke naam se pukaarte hai
 Luckily, the vision of Abercrombie and Richards, a recognized critic of English, has just attracted this element
 rastatv kii mimasaa bhartiya aalochakon ke manovaigyanik samikshapaddati ke anushilan kaa manoram fal he
 Poetry is a reflection in the euphoria of supernatural bliss whether it is poetry, audio or visual
 hridayapaksh hi kavy kaa kalapaksh kii apeksha nitant madhutar tathaa shobhan paksh he, is tathy par bhartiya aalochana kaa nitant aagrah he
 Indian criticism is not at all providential in its scrutiny of the problem solving philosophy of life and thus it alone represents the three scriptures of the Western world - "poetics", "retarics" and "aesthetics"

 The 1202 book Liber Abeki, written by Fibonacci, introduced this sequence in West European mathematics, although this sequence has already been described in Indian mathematics

 He considered the development of an ideal rabbit population, assuming that: iskaa niyam yah he ki khargoshon kii ek jodi apane jivan-kaal main 2 jodi paidaa karti he or mar jaati he
 Suppose the population is f in n months
 is samay, keval ve khargosh, jo n - 2 maheene main jivit rahe the, prajnanksham hai or santan paidaa karte hai, to f jode maujuuda aabaadi f main jud jate hai
 Thus, the total is f = f + F

 The series of linear combinations φ n { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^ {n}} and n { \ displaystyle ^ {n}}, including the coefficients a and b, can be defined by is prakaar paribhaashit sabhi shrinkhlaayein fibonachi prayaavartan kii purti karti hai Where f a, b = 0 { \ displaystyle F_ {a, b} = 0} and f a, b = 1 { \ displaystyle F_ {a, b} = 1} yields a = 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle a = 1 / { \ sqrt {5}}} and b = - 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle give b = -1 / { \ sqrt {5}}}, resulting in the same binet formula from which we started Was It has been shown that this formula fulfills the Fibonacci alternation
 In addition, an explicit investigation can be done: or Proving the original arrival questions, certify that isliye, kinhin do praarambhik mulyon ke liye, sangyojan a, b { \ displaystyle a,b} ko is tarah paaya ja saktaa he ki falan f a, b { \ displaystyle F_{a,b} \ ,}, anukram ke liye sateek purna sutara he
 Since for all n ≥ 0 { \ displaystyle n \ geq 0} | 1 - 4 n / 5 = 0 { \ displaystyle k> = 0} is found for integers iske vipareet, Sometimes the integer sums on the inverse Fibonacci numbers can be calculated in terms of theta function
 For example, we can write the sum of every odd-exponential Fibonacci number as follows or vargakar vyutkram fibonachi sankhya ke yoga ko nimna rup main If we add 1 to each Fibonacci number in the first sum, there will also be a complete formula
 or vargakar fibonachi sankhya kaa acha vargeekrut yoga he, jo sunahare anupaat kaa vyutkram detaa he, Such results seem correct to see that a complete formula for the simple sum of inverse Fibonacci numbers can be found, but no such has yet been known
 Despite that, the inverse Fibonacci constant richard andre-jianin dwaara aparimey sabit kiya gaya he
 The Fibonacci prime number is a Fibonacci number that is prime

 Any consecutive three Fibonacci numbers, taking two at a time, have been proportional prime numbers: ie, or saamanytah, The divisibility of Fibonacci numbers by the prime p is related to the Legendre sign { \ displaystyle \ ; \ left} which is assumed to be as follows: agar p ek abhajya sankhya he, to f p ≡ and f p − ≡ 0 
 { \ displaystyle F_{p} \ equiv \ left{ \ pmod {p}} \ ; \ ;{ \ mbox{ and }} \ ; \ ; \ ;f_{p- \ left} \ equiv 0{ \ pmod {p}}
} for example, yah gyaat nahin he ki koi abhajya p aise maujuud he ki f p − ≡ 0 { \ displaystyle F_{p- \ left} \ equiv 0{ \ pmod {p^{2 xxrep 4 } is tarah kii abhajya sankhyaon ko waal-san-san abhajya sankhya kaha jayega
 Also, if p ≠ 5 is an odd prime number, then: sabhi maamalon ke udhaaharan: For odd n, all odd prime divisors of f n are ≡ 1, indicating that all odd divisors of f n are ≡ 1
 udhaaharan ke liye, f 1 = 1, f 3 = 2, f 5 = 5, f 7 = 13, f 9 = 34 = 2 × 17, f 11 = 89, f 13 = 233, f 15 = 610 = 2 × 5 × 61 ∑ k = n n + 9 f k = 11 f n + 6 { \ displaystyle \ sum _{k=n}^{n+9}f_{k}=11f_{n+6}} For example, let n = 1: f 1 + f 2 + 


 + f 10 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 = 143 = 11×13n = 2:F2+F3+


+F11 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 + 89 = 231 = 11×21n = 3:F3+F4+


+F12 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 + 89 + 144= 374 = 11×34 In fact, the identities are not only positive, but are true for all n integers: n = 0: F0 + F1 + 


 + F9 = 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 = 88 = 11 × 8n = −1: F−1+F0+


+F8 = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 = 55 = 11×5n = −2: f − 2 + f − 1 + F0 + 


 + F7 = −1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 = 33 = 11 × 3 yah aasaani se dekha ja saktaa he ki agar fibonachi anukram kii ikaayiyon ne mod n liya he, to adhik se adhik n 2 aavartan sahit parinami anukram aavartak honi chahie

 The angle of deviation, adjacent to 137
51 °, is the golden angle, which divides the circle into the golden ratio
 Because this ratio is irrational, there is no one else at the same angle from the center, side of a floret, so the florets are efficiently filled together
 Because the formula for the rational approximation of the golden ratio is F: F, the index in the nearest neighborhood of the floral number n is at n ± f for j based on the distance r from the center

 Emanuel Kant was a German scientist, ethicist and philosopher
 uskaa vaigyanik mat "kaant-laplas pariklpana" ke naam se vikhyath he
 According to the above hypothesis, the solar system originated from the Saturn Vapor Nebula
 kaant kaa naitik mat "naitik shuddhta" kaa siddhant, "kartavya ke liye kartavya" kaa siddhant athwa "kathoratavaad" kaha jaataa he
 His philosophical view is known as "critical philosophy"
 emanuele kaant apane is prachaar se prasiddh huye ki manushya ko aise karm or kathan karne chahiyein jo agar sabhi karen to ve manushyata ke liye achche hon
 Emanuel Kant was born on April 22, 1724 AD, in the city of Königüzburg, under the East Provinces of Germany
 koniguzaberg shahar aaj rus main he or ab iskaa naam kalininograd Kaliningrad he
 His early education was under the supervision of his mother, who was greatly influenced by the religious movement called the "holy Way" of his time
 atev, alpaayu main hi vah dharmanumodith aacharan, saral, suvyavasthit evam adhyavsypurna jivan main ruchi rakhane laga tha
 At the age of 16, after completing his education at the "collegium Pheidrichianum", he entered the University of Königsberg, where for six years he studied physics, mathematics, philosophy and theology
 vishvavidhyalay chhodane ke baad kaant nau varshon ke liye, konigsburg se 60 mile dur, judsken naamak gaanv main chalaa gaya
 There he taught his livelihood in two families and continued his self-study in physics and philosophy
 is bich uske bahut se lekh tathaa laghugranth prakashit hue, jinamein se do–"jivit shaktiyon ke uchit anumaan par vichaar" tathaa "saamaanya prakritik itihaas evam akashasambandhi siddhant" vishesh ullekh hai
 In the first of these publications, he attempted to coordinate the ideas of power of Rene Dacart and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz, and in the second the mechanical and objectivist ideas of Newton and Leibnitz, and in the second, the mechanical and purposive ideas of Newton and Leibnitz
 usne "doctor legence" kii oopaadhi ke nimitt aavashyak prabandh bhi 1755 i
 main prastut kar diya tha or konigsburg vishvavidhyalay ne use ukt oopaadhi pradaan kar uski yogyata pramanit kii thi
 But there was no change in his personal problems
 vishvavidhyalay ne uske nau varsh ke parishram se prasann hokar use vishisht vyaakhyaata niyukt kar liya tha, kintu is kaary ke liye use vetan kuch bhi nahin miltaa tha
 Kant, despite odd circumstances, served the university unpaid until 1766 AD
 1758 i
 main usne tark or darshan ke mukhya adhyaaapak pad ke liye prarthana kii thi, kintu vah asafal rahaa
 In 1766 AD, he was appointed Assistant Library Manager along with teaching and now he got ten pounds annual salary
 chaar varshon tak kaant ne is rup main bhi kaary kiya, kintu usne adhyayan chintan or lekhan kaary jari rakhaa
 After being appointed "private Dozant", by 1770 AD, five of his epics were published - uparyukt granthon ke sheershakon se pataa chalata he ki 1755 or 1770 i
 ke bich kaa samay kaant ke vichaaron ke nirmaan kaa tha
 His thinking appears to have developed in a systematic way with the Latin installation paper published in 1770 AD - "the Shapes and Principles of World's Understanding and Wisdom"
 isi varsh, vah konigsburg vishvavidhyalay main tark or darshan ke usee adhyaaapak pad par niyukt hua, jiske liai use 12 varsh purv niraash hona padaa tha
 He had already become worry-free as he was getting 60 pounds annual salary
 un dinon itnaa vetan sammanit adhyapakon ko hi diya jaataa tha
 The publication of texts also did not yield any large amount of money
 apane "critic ov pyor rizan" se kaant ko keval 30 pound aay hui thi
 But, not aspiring for material comforts, till 1796 AD, he was actively striving for the growth of knowledge of the world
 in 26 varshon main se aadi ke 12 varsh usne keval ek pustak ""shuddh buddhi kii samiksha" ke likhane main vyateet kiye
 The above book was published in 1781 AD
 kaant ke praudh granthon main yah sarvshereshth darshanik granth mana jaataa he
 Other texts of this period include "the Role of Every Future Philosophy", "the Background of Ethics", "the Philosophical Foundations of Natural Science", "review of Practical Wisdom", "review of Judgment", "religion Limited Only by Wisdom", and " On eternal peace "
 1796 i
 ke baad bhi vah adhyayan, chintan evam lekhan main vyast rahaa kintu uske jivan ke ye aath varsh badi dayaneey dasha main vyateet hue
 His memory had become so weak that he had to remember even by writing small things
 swayan apane ghar kii dekhbhaal karne kii shakti usamen nahin thi; vivaah usne kiya nahin tha, kintu 42 varsh ke adhyaapan kaal main usne apane sahyogiyon evam vidhyaarthiyon par acha prabhaav daalaa tha
 Therefore, he received a lot of support and sympathy from friends and disciples in the last part of his life
 san 1801 i
 ke baad to vah bahut hi ashakt ho gaya tha, kintu antim teen varshon main vesiyaanski naamak uske shishy ne saath rahakar ahernish uski dekhbhaal kii
 Surprisingly, there are seven texts of Kant written in this period - "nitidarshan", "philosophical Foundations of the Theory of Moral Merit", "maanas shaktiyon kaa antvirodh,, "anthropology in practical terms", "tarkshastra, "bhautik bhugol" tathaa "shikshashastra" 
 After doing so much work, he died on 12 February 1804 in Königsberg
 kaant kaa vyaktigat jivan atal niyamon se jakadaaa hua tha
 From dawn to dusk, all his works were done at certain times
 bhojan ke samay ke sanlap ke bhi niyam the
 Most of the Western philosophers have been wandering, but Kant went more than sixty miles from his city in his lifetime
 phir bhi uskaa drushtikon sankuchit na tha
 He was not merely an intellectual thinker, he gave his philosophical ideas a place in life like Socrates and Pythagoras
 hine naamak german kavi ne kaant ke darshanik jivan kii prashansa main aisi baaten kahi hai jo use sanakee siddh karti hai, kintu, uske vichaaron ne uttarvarti darshan ko itnaa prabhavit kiya ki kaant ke adhyeta use darshan main ek naveen yug kaa pravartak maanate hai

 Kamma Telugu: కమ్మ or Kammavaru is a social community found mostly in the South Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka
 varsh 1881 main kamma jati kii jansankhya 795,732 thi
 According to the 1921 census, they had 4
0% of the population of Andhra Pradesh and they were present in a large number in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka

 Many concepts exist about the term "kammas" and the origin of the social community known as kammas but none is conclusive
 ek siddhant yah he ki krishna nadi kii ghati ke buddha pradhan ilaakon main rahane vaale logon ko yah naam kamma yaa karma ke theraoda buddha vichaar se praapt hua tha
 The region was once known as Kammarashtram / Kammaratham / Kammanadu which was under the control of the Pallavas, Eastern Chalukyas and Cholas
 kammanadu ke ullekh vaale shilaalekh teesri sadi si
i
 ke baad se uplabdh hai
 According to some historians Kamma existed since the Maurya period
 kuch itihaaskaaron kaa mat tha ki kamma naam sambhawatah kambhoj se liya gaya he
 The commentary of Awadh Bihari Lal Awasthi is as follows: We find Kambhi, Kammah, Kumbhi etc
 among the castes of South India
 sambhawatah dakshin bharat main ek kamboj desh bhi rahaa hoga 
 garud puraana main ashmak, pulind, jimuta, narrashtra, lata or karnata deshon ke aas-paas ek kambhoj samrajya / riyasat ke bare main bataaya gaya he, saath hi vishesh rup se hamen yah bhi bataata he ki kamboj ke hisse bharat ke dakshini bhaag main rahete the
 Pulind Ashmak Jimuta Narrashtra Nivasinh karnata kamboj gata dakshinpathwasina 
 Another origin of the Kammas is estimated as: Buddhist Kurmis of the Gangetic plains migrated to the delta region of the Krishna River in large numbers to escape the tyranny of Pushyamitra Sunga
 Buddhism was already flourishing in Dharanikota, Bhattiprolu, Chandavolu etc
 in this fertile region
 itihaaskaaron ne yah anumaan lagaaya he ki sanskrit shabd kurmi / kurm baad ke varshon main kamma ban gaya hoga
 kammarashtram shabd kaa pehla record ikshvaku raja madhariputra purushdatt ke jaggayyapeta shilaalekh main miltaa he
 Kammarashtram extended from the Krishna River to Kandukur
 aglaa record pallav raja kumaar vishnu dwitiya kaa tha jiske baad purvi chalukya raja maangi yuvaraj kaa zikr aata he
 The later inscription finds mention of Telugu Cholas / Chodas and Kammanadu in the Kakatiya dynasty
 is kshetra ko pallav samrajya ke kaaran pallavanadu / palanadu / palnadu ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 The social community Kammas have recently been identified as involved in haplogroups R2, L1, R1a1 and q *
 heplogrup R2 kii yatra ke baad yah anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki yah saamaajik samudaay sambhawatah bihar kshetra ke ashok ke maury samrajya se pravasit hokar andhra pradesh ke palnadu kshetra main sthit or kendrit satvaahan samrajya main chalaa gaya hoga
 is pravaas main andhra desh main buddha dharm kaa prasar hua ho saktaa he
 Even further, there would have been migration for many generations in the coastal areas and other areas of Andhra Pradesh in the desire for green pastures
 kai shilalekhon se yah pataa chalata he ki kammanadu ke raajaaon or sainikon ne 10veen sadi ke baad se nayak / naikudu tital kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 By this time, around 1200 Kamma surnames are known
 1068 sii main badbanal bhatta ne kamma or velma ke kulanaamon or gotron ko soochibaddh kiya tha
 The names of ancestral villages were adopted as gotras
 isse pataa chalata he ki kamma or velma jatiyaan buddha yaa jain dharm ko maanati thim jinhone gotra pranali kaa paalan nahin kiya tha or yah ki donon saamaajik samudaayon kaa ek saamaan itihaas tha
 The historical reasons for the bifurcation of the two communities are not known, although many stories exist
 kai kamma nayakon ke shilalekhon main ullekh kiya gaya he ki ve durjaya kul se sambandhit the
 For example, in the inscription of Pinnama Naidu in the Sagareswar temple in Madala village, it is mentioned that he belonged to Durjay Kul and Valutla gotra
 usee mandir main ek anya shilaalekh main ullekh he ki devineni era naidu, kommi naidu or pothee naidu buddhavrma kul, durjaya kabeeley or valutla gotra se sambandhit the
 The inscription at Ravuru mentions that the bodyguards of Empress Rudrama Devi, Ekki Naidu, Rudra Naidu, Pinarudra Naidu and Pothi Naidu belonged to the Durjoy dynasty and the Valitla gotra
 
 yahan yah ullekh karnaa mahatvapurn he ki kamma jati ke kai marshall kul valutr gotra se sambandhit the
 Many Telugu Chod communities of Kammanadu had connections with many eastern Chalukyas and later Kakatiyas

 "chalukya Narayana" was a surname of Vasireddy clan
 
 itihaaskaaron ne yah anumaan lagaaya he ki 10veen sadi ke ant tak durjaya, chod, chalukyon ke kuch bhaag or kammanadu ke haihay samudaay kamma jati main sammilit ho gaye the
 The division and consolidation of the warrior class into several castes began during the time of Kakatiya king Rudra I
 velugotiwari vanshavali or padmanayakacharitra ke anusaar madhyayugin kaal main likhe gaye pustakon main kisaan kamma or welma ban gaye the
 In medieval times the word 'kapu' meant a farmer or protector
