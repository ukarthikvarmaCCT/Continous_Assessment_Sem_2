 Overall, these studies provide good information about the structure and function of simple metabolic pathways, but seem insufficient to apply them to more complex mechanisms such as the metabolism of the whole cell

 Using these techniques, a model of human metabolism has been created, which will guide future drug discovery and biochemical research
 These models are currently being used in network analysis to classify human diseases into groups with similar proteins or metabolites

 The history of scientific studies of metabolism spans many centuries and ranges from the examination of whole animals in early studies, to the investigation of individual metabolic reactions in modern biochemistry

 In these early studies, the methods of these metabolic processes have not been identified and it was believed that some divine force regulates living tissue

 After the discovery of enzymes by Edward Buckner in the early 20th century, chemical reactions of metabolism and biological studies of cells began to be carried out separately and biochemistry began
 In the early 20th century, biochemical information grew rapidly
 The most active of these modern biochemists was Hans Krebs, who made a major contribution to the study of metabolism
 unhone uria chakra or haans carnberg ke saath kaam karte hue, citric acid chakra or glayaxilette chakra kaa avishkaar kiya
 Modern biochemical research has been greatly aided by new techniques such as chromatography, x-ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, radioisotopic labeling, electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations

 It was one of the most watched serials of its original broadcast time
 yah kahani madhya yug main madhya purv ke aasapaas ghoomte rahati he
 The story begins with the birth of Hatim, the son of the Emperor of Yemen
 usee samay jaffaar ke samraat ke ghar bhi putr kaa janm hota he, jiske liye kaha jaataa he ki wo buree shaktiyon kaa sevak banegaa
 For this reason, the king of Jaffar decided to kill for the benefit of the world
 usne najumi ko uske bachche ke dil ko jalaane kaa aadesh de diya
 Najumi secretly served evil powers, so he burned a rabbit's heart in place of her child and told the king that he had burnt his son's heart
 najumi ne us bachche kaa naam dajjaal rakhaa, or sari buree shaktiyon kii kala sikhaane laga
 After twenty years, Dajjal comes back to his palace and after killing his father, he becomes the emperor of his own
 vah buree shaktiyon se minaaron kaa nirmaan karata he, jisase uski shakti kai guna bad jaati he
 Nazumi tells him that he has to capture good powers to rule the whole world

 dallaal use pathar bana detaa he, or sunaina se kahata he ki yadi use uskaa bhai thik chahie, to use usase saat maheenon ke bheetar shaadi kerani hogi
 In Yemen, Hatim's marriage is decided with the princess of Jasmine from Pariistan
 shaadi kii sari taiyaari bhi ho jaati he, tabhi sunaina kaa premi, rajkumaar vishaal vahaan aa jaataa he, or hatim se madad maangata he

 Gradually Hatim continues to get answers to those questions, and Dajjal's strength starts to decrease
 saatven or antim sawaal kaa jawaab hatim ko dajjaal se hi mil saktaa tha
 With the solution to the final question, Hatim also learns that his death will be from the hands of Dajjal and that Dajjal will also die from the hands of Hatim

 amedio klemente modigliani ek italvi kalakaar the jo mukhya rup se france main kaam karte the
 He was primarily a figurative artist, he was known for painting and sculpting in the modern style, featuring masks-like faces and tall motifs
 tubarcular mainingitis ke kaaran paris main unka nidhan ho gaya, jisamen garibi, atyadhik kaam or sharaab or nashile padaarthon ke seven ne bhi apni bhoomika nibhaai
 Modigliani was born into a Jewish family in Livorno, Italy
 bandargah vaala shahar, livorano lambe samay tak dharm ke naam par pratadit logon ke liye sharansthali bana rahaa or bade yahudee samudaay kaa nivas sthaan bana rahaa
 His maternal grandfather, Solomon Garcin, immigrated to Livorno as a refugee in the 18th century
 modigliani, flminio modigliani or unki francisi patni, iugenia garsin ke chauthe bachche the
 His father was a money-changer, but when his business failed, his family faced poverty
 Amedio's birth saved the family from ruin, because according to an ancient law, creditors could not seize the bed of a pregnant woman or the mother of a newborn
 belifon ne thik usee samay unke ghar main pravesh kiya jab iugenia prasav pidaa main chali gayin; parivaar ne apane ghar kii moolyawaan sampattiyon ko unke upar rakh kar bachaa liya
 Modigliani had a close relationship with his mother, who taught him at home until he was ten years old
 gyaarah varsh kii aayu main playurisi kaa daura padane ke baad unki swasthya samasyaayein shuru hui, kuch saal baad unamem typhoid bukhaar kaa maamla viksit hua
 When she was sixteen years old, she fell ill again and succumbed to the tuberculosis which would later lead to her death
 modigliani playurisi ke duusare daur se ubarne ke baad, unki maa unhen pehle dakshini italy ke daure par le gayin: neples, kapari, rome or amalphi or phir uttar kii ore florence or venice
 In many ways, his mother played an important role in his ability to adopt art as a profession
 When he was eleven years old, he wrote in his diary: modigliani ko bahut choti umr se chitrakaari karte hue janaa jaataa he or unki maa ne likhaa ki aupchaarik adhyayan shuru karne se pehle hi ve apane aap ko "ek chitrakaar" samajhane lage the
 Despite her misgivings that her studies of art would impede her other studies, the young Modigliani's mother fueled her passion for the subject
 chaudaa varsh kii umr main, typhoid bukhaar se grasit, ve apane paagalpan main pralaap karte rahe ki, ve sabase zyada, palajo pitti or florence main ufiji ke chitrakaariyon ko dekhnaa chaahate hai
 The local museum at Livorno had only a few paintings made by Italian Renaissance masters, stories that he had heard about Florence caused curiosity in him and in his state of illness, it was a source of great disappointment to him that he would ever Will not be able to see you face to face
 Her mother promised her that after her recovery, she would take him to Florence herself
 Not only did he fulfill his promise, but he also took the responsibility of recruiting him to Livorno's best painting guru, Guglielmo Micheli
 modigliani ne 1898 se 1900 tak misheli ke kala skool main kaam kiya
 His first formal art training here took place in the 19th century in an atmosphere steeped in the study of styles and subjects of Italian art
 unke purv ke paris ke kaam main, is prabhaav ke or unke punarjagran kala kii padhai ke nishaan ko abhi bhi dekha ja saktaa he: is navdith kaam ko jitna jeeyovni boldini jaise kalakaaron dwaara aakaar diya gaya utana hi tulus-lutrek dwaara bhi diya gaya
 While Modigliani did a good job with Micheli and left his studies only when he was forced to do so due to the onset of his tuberculosis
 1901 main, rome main rahete hue, modigliani ne domenico morali ke kaam kii saraahna kii, jo bible se jude bhavuktapurna naatak adhyayan or mahaan sahitya se drishyon ke chitrakaar the
 It is ironic that he was so impressed with Morelli, as this painter served as an inspiration to a group opposing idolatry known as Di Machiaioli and Modigliani had already been influenced by Machiaioli Were
 is choti se, sthaniyakrut paridrishy andolan kaa kaaran tha shaikshanik style chitrakaaron dwaara puunjipati ruparekha ke khilaaf pratikriya kii aavashyaktaa
 francisi prabhaavvaadiyon se sahanubhutipurvak jude hone ke baavjood, machieoli antarrashtriya kala par vaisaa prabhaav nahin daal paae jaisaa monet ki samakalinon or anuyaayiyon ne daalaa or ve aaj kii taarikh main italy ke baahar kaaphi had tak vismrit kiye ja chuke hai
 Modigliani's association with this movement was linked through Guglielmo Micheli, who was his first art teacher
 misheli naa keval khud machiaolo the, apitu is andolan ke prasiddh sansthaapak jiovani fatori ke ek chaatr bhi the
 Micheli's work was so decorative and style so common that young Modigliani reacted against it, under which he preferred to ignore Ladscape's passion, which, like French Impressionism, characterized the movement
 misheli ne apane shishyon ko sade kagaz par chitrakaari karne ke liye bhi protsaahit kiya, lekin modigliani ko is style main kaam karne, cafe main chitrakaari karne main mazaa nahin aayaa, apitu ve ghar ke andar or vishesh rup se apane khud ke studio main chitrakaari karnaa pasand karte the
 Even when he was forced to create landscapes, Modigliani used a proto-cubist palette instead of Machiaioli that was more similar to Cézanne
 misheli ke saath ke dauraan, modigliani ne naa keval landscape kaa, balki unhone portret, sthir-jivan or nagn chitrakaari kaa bhi adhyayan kiya
 His fellow students recall that he showcased his best talent in the final work and was apparently not a purely educational pursuit for this teenager: when he did not paint nude, he would look at the house maids
 Used to be busy making physical relations with
 machieoli drushtikon ko asweekaar karne ke baavjood, modigliani ko unke shikshak se protsaahan praapt hua, jo unhen "superman" kah kar sanderbhit karte the, yah ek aisa upnaam tha jo is tathy ko darshata he ki modigliani naa keval apni kala main nipun the, balki yah bhi kii ve niyamit rup se nitshe ke daz spoke zarathustra se uddhrut kiya karte the
 Fattori himself often visited the studio and appreciated the young artist's innovations
 1902 main, modigliani ne aage chal kar apane jivan bhar kaa aakarshan banane vaale maanav chithran ko jari rakhaa, jiske tahat unhone florence main academia di balle arti main daakhila liya
 a year later, while he was still suffering from tuberculosis, he relocated to Venice where he enrolled to study at the Istituto di Bat Arti
 venice main hi unhone pehali baar charas kaa seven kiya or adhyayan karne ke bajaae, praayah shahar ke apkirtikar bhaagon main chakkar kaatane lage
 The impact of these lifestyle choices on their evolving artistic style is a matter of speculation
 haalanki ye vikalp keval saamaanya kishor avasthaa vidroh, yaa us samay ke kalakaaron se aam taur par ummid kii jane vaali premawad or rdhimuktvaad se kuch adhik lag rahaa tha; unke jivan ke maile bhaag kii khoj kii jaden unke kattarpanthi darshanon, jinamein nitshe kii bhi shaamil he, kii siraahna main milti he
 Being exposed to scholarly philosophical literature under the tutelage of his maternal grandfather as a young boy, he read and influenced Nietzsche, Baudelaire, Carducci, Comte de Lautreiamont and others through his art studies and developed this belief That the path to true artistry only passes through defiance and disorganization
 1901 main jo patr unhone kapari ke apane 'vishram-kaal' se likhe the unase spasht rup se sanket miltaa he ki ve nitshe kii soch se adhik se adhik prabhavit ho rahe hai
 In these letters he advises his friend Oscar Ghiglia; is samay par lautreyamont kaa kaam bhi utana hi prabhaavshaalee ho gaya tha
 This unfortunate poet's Le Chantes de Maldorre became the primary work for the Surrealists of Paris' generation of Modigliani's generation and the book became a favorite of Modigliani's to the extent that he missed it
 lautreyamont kii kavita kii visheshta he vilakshan tatwon kii nikatataa or parapidak kalpana; modigliani kaa itani choti umr main is path dwaara itnaa prabhavit hone kaa tathy unke viksit hote ruchi kii ore sanket detaa he
 Baudelaire and d'annunzio woo young artists alike because of their interest in corrupt beauty and by expressing that understanding through symbolist imagination
 modigliani ne ghiglia ko kapari se bade paimaane par likhaa, jahaan unki maa unhen tapedic se thik hone main sahaayta karne ke liye le gayi thim
 These letters were a means to the sound of evolving thoughts that ripen in Modigliani's mind
 ghiglia modigliani se saat saal varisht the or yah sambhaavna bhi he ki ye vahiin hai jinhonen us yuvak ko livorano main unki kshamta kii seemaa dikhaai
 sabhi acalpakv kishoron kii tarah, modigliani ko apane se badi umr vaale saathiyon kaa saath pasand tha or apni kishoravastha main ghiglia kii bhoomika ek sahanubhutipurna shrota kii thi jaisaa ve bataate he, vishesh rup se un jatil patron main jinhen ve niyamit rup se bheja karte the or jo abhi bhi hai
 i write to pour myself out to you and to affirm myself to myself
 i am the prey of great powers that surge forth and then disintegrate


 a bourgeois told me today – insulted me – that i or at least my brain was lazy
 It did me good
 i should like such a warning every morning upon awakening: but they cannot understand us nor can they understand life 


 1906 main modigliani paris aa gayi, jo us samay kala ke aadhunik saadhakon kaa centre bindu tha
 In fact, his arrival at this center of artistic experiment coincided with the arrival of two more foreigners who would later leave their mark in the art world: Gino Severini and Juan Greece
 ve laa vaatau-lavor main bas gaye, jo montmartre main garib kalakaaron kaa samudaay tha or unhone rue kaulancourt main khud ke liye ek studio kiraye par liya
 Although the artist's residence in Montmartre reflected generalized poverty, Modigliani himself initially introduced it as a family boy trying to keep his family's lost economic status to the present: his dress unabashedly Was built and the studio he rented was employed in a style that resembled some plush draperies and Renaissance replicas Switch to an accurate knowledge was accurate attuned
 unhone jald hi bohemian kalakaar kaa bhesh banane kaa prayaas kiya, lekin, apane bhure cordroy, laal dupattey or badi kaali topi main bhi ve aise lagate the jaise kii bure samay kii chapet main aakar unhone juggiyon kaa pahanava apana liya ho
 When he first came to Paris, he would regularly write letters to his mother at home, doing his nude paintings at the Academia Kolarossi and drinking small amounts of alcohol
 us samay unhen jaanane waalo kii unke vishay main raay thi ki ve thode gambheer prakruti ke or lagbhag asaamaajik the
 It is recorded that at the time when he met Picasso wearing his trademark worker's clothes, he remarked that although the man is talented, this cannot be an excuse for his ugly dress
 paris main pahunchane ke ek varsh ke bheetar, tathaapi, unki chaal - dhaal or pratishtha naatakeey rup se badal gayi
 He transformed himself from a professional scholar artist to a prince of nomads
 kavi or patrkaar lui laturet ne unke parivartan ke baad, is kalakaar ke purv main susajjit studio main jaakar paaya ki vah jagah avyavasthit he, punarjagran pratikrutiyon ko deevaaron se hataa diya gaya he or aaleeshaan parde astavyast hai
 By this time Modigliani had already become an alcoholic and drug servant and this was reflected in his studio
 modigliani kaa is samay kaa vyavhaar unke ek kalakaar ke rup main viksit hoti style par prakaash daalata he, jisamen unka studio, shaikshik kala kii un sabhi chizon ke liye lagbhag ek bali kaa putala ban chukaa tha jinase ve nafrat karte the or jo unke ab tak ke jivan or prashikshan dene kii pahchaan bana hua tha
 Not only did he remove all the adornments of his bourgeois heritage from his studio, but, he was practically destroying his former works
 unhone apane hairaan padosiyon ko apane asaadhaaran krity ke vishay main samajhaate hue kaha: The motivation for the violent rejection of his former personality is subject to considerable speculation
 yah aatm vinaashkari pravriti unke tapedic se or is gyaan se utpann hui hogi ki is rog ne unhen multah ek akaal maut ke liye chunaa he: is kalakaar ke nivas kshetra ke bheetar kaiyon ne is tarah kii maut kaa saamana kiya or isamen saamaanya pratikriya thi ki jab tak jivan he uskaa anand le liya jaye, mukhyatah aatm vinaashkari kaaryon main lipt hone ke dwaara
 modigliani ke liye is prakaar kaa vyavhaar pahchaan ke abhaav ke jawaab main kiya gaya ho saktaa he, ve utrilo or sutin jaise kalakaaron ke sanidhya main rahete the, taaki unhen apane sahyogiyon se apane kaam ke liye sweekruti or manyata mil sake
 Modigliani's behavior also stood out in these Bohemian environments: he often kept on bonding, drinking heavily and consuming saliva and hashish
 nashe kii haalat main, ve kabhi-kabhi saamaajik samarohon main nagn ho jate the
 He became an icon of a tragic artist, who became a role model posthumously, almost like Vincent van Gogh
 1920 ke dashak ke dauraan, modigliani ke karier ke parinamswaroop or andre salmon ke un tippaniyon se uttejit jisamen unhone modigliani kii style kii utpatti kaa shrey chirita or charas ko diya, kai ummidavaaron ne maadak dravyon kaa seven karke or charam bohimian raah par chal kar unki "safalataa" kii barabari karne kii koshish kii
 Salman - erroneously - claimed that Modigliani was completely a street imprint artist when he became conscious
 haalanki yah prachaar un logon ke liye samarthan jutaney kaa jariya ban gaya jinamein dukhad, barbaad kalakaar banane kii ek romaanchak laalasaa thi, yah ranneetiyaan un logon main adwitiya kalatmak antardrushti yaa takanic nahin paidaa kar paayi jinamein yah pehle se hi nahin thi
 In fact, art historians suggest that it was entirely possible for Modigliani to have reached greater artistic heights if he had not been imprisoned by his own enjoyment and wasted by it
 We can only speculate on which heights he would have been able to touch with his self-destructive discovery
 paris main apane praarambhik varshon ke dauraan, modigliani ne ugr gati se kaam kiya
 He used to draw continuously and make hundred pictures in a day
 lekin, unki kai kritiyaan kho gai - kai ko unhone kharaab maan kar nasht kar diya, apana awaas badalte rahane ke kaaran peeche chhot gayi, yaa phir apni pramikaaon ko de diya jinhone use rakhaa nahin
 He was first influenced by Henri de Toulouse Lautrec, but around 1907 he was fascinated by the works of Paul Cézanne
 He eventually developed his own unique style, a style that cannot be fully categorized with other artists
 jab ve 26 varsh ke the to unhen apane jivan kaa pehla gambhir prem hua, 1910 main roosi kavyitri anna akhmatova se
 donon kaa studio samaan imaarat main tha or haalanki 21 varshiya anna kaa haal hi main vivaah hua tha, donon kaa chakkar chalane laga
 Long and dark-haired, pale yellow and greenish-brown eyes, she embodied the beauty ideal of Virgo Modigliani and the pair became fascinated with each other
 ek saal baad, haalanki, anna apane pati ke paas laut gai

 Despite their family's protests, they soon began living together and although Hebuterne was the current love of their lives, their public scenes remained more famous than Modigliani's personal drunken exhibitions

 On a visit to Nice, which was thought and organized by Leopold Zborowski, Modigliani, Faujita and other artists, these artists tried to sell their artifacts to wealthy tourists

 iske baavjood, is dauraan unhone adhiktar aise chitra banaaye jo aage chal kar unke sarvaadhik lokapriy or mahatvapurn kaamon main gine gaye
 During his lifetime, he sold many of his artworks, but could never sell any for much money

 There is no single principle for archeology, but there are multiple theories, according to which archaeologists believe that information should be interpreted differently
 Throughout the history of this field of knowledge, various trends of support for some archaeological theories have emerged, culminating and in some cases ending
 kuch puratetvik siddhanton, jaise prakriyaatmak puraatatv kaa maananaa he ki puratatvvid apni khojbin main vaigyanik vidhi kaa upyog kar bhootkaal ke samaajon ke bare main sateek or vastunishth soochna viksit karne main sakasham ho sakate hai, jabaki uttar-prakriyaatmak puraatatv jaisaa khemaa isaki satyata par sawaal karata he or yah daawa karata he ki puratetvik saamagree ko maanviya vyakhya or saamaajik karkon dwaara vikrut kiya ja saktaa he or isliye bhootkaal ke samaajon ke bare main unki koi vyakhya vyaktinishth hi hoti he
 In turn, other archaeological theories, such as Marxist archeology, interpret archaeological evidence within the framework of how its proponents hold views regarding the operation and development of society
 puratetvik siddhant ke itihaas main pehla pramukh charan saamanytah saanskrithik yaa samskruti itihaas ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 The grouping of sites into separate "cultures" is a product of cultural history, so that the geographical spread of these cultures and the scope of their time can be determined and reconstructed the interaction and flow of ideas between them
 
 Cultural history, as the name itself suggests, is closely associated with the science of history

 Thus, cultures can be distinguished by patterns of craftsmanship, for example if one piece of pottery from the excavation is decorated with a triangular pattern, the other with a four-edged pattern, and they are probably from different cultures
 Be related Such an approach naturally leads to a view of the past as different populations, classified by their differences and their effects on each other

 Influenced by the political turmoil in the inter-war period, Childi then argued that revolutions shaped major changes in societies of the past
 He anticipated a Neolithic revolution, which inspired people to settle and farm in exchange for wandering prey

 He saw culture as a set of behavioral processes and traditions
 
 Proceduralists embraced realistic sciences with the idea of hypothesis testing and the scientific method
 unka maananaa tha ki ek puratatvavid ko adhyayan ke tahat lee gai ek samskruti ke bare main ek yaa adhik pariklpanaaen viksit kerani chahie or taaja sabooton ke khilaaf in pariklpanaaon ke pareekshan ke iraade se khudaai kerani chahie

 An approach to the study of archaeological materials was developed by Michael B

 The bleaching process can be summarized as the following set of chemical reactions: Cl2 + H2O ⇌ { \ displaystyle \ rightleftharpoons } \ rightleftharpoons H+ + Cl- + hclo The h + ion of hypochlorous acid then dissolves in the solution and thus the end result is effectively: Cl2 + H2O ⇌ { \ displaystyle \ rightleftharpoons } \ rightleftharpoons 2H+ + Cl- + clo- The hypochlorite is decomposed into chloride and leading to a highly reactive form: 2clo- → { \ displaystyle \ rightarrow } \ rightarrow 2cl- + O2 In most pigments and pigments, dyes are formed by molecules, such as beta carotene, which contain chromophores
 rasinic viranjak do main se ek tareeke se kaam karte hai: Sunlight acts as a bleaching agent through a process that produces similar results: high-energy photons of light, often breaking the chromophore bonds in the violet or ultraviolet range, can colorless the substance, often with extended contact Produces color blindness on a very large scale, which usually decomposes the colors to white color and a highly blown blue spectrum

 As a family of Godan heroine and heroine Hori and coriander, we find a special culture of India alive and living, a culture which is now ending or is about to happen, yet in which the soil of India is filled is
 premchand ne ise amar bana diya he
 Godan is Premchand's Hindi novel in which his art has reached its peak
 godaan main bhartiya kisaan kaa sampurna jivan - uski aakanksha or niraashaa, uski dharmabhirutha or bharatparayanata ke saath swarthparata ore baithkbaaji, uski bebasii or nirihata- kaa jeeta jaagta chitra upasthit kiya gaya he
 His neck is strapped under the leg, bending the tribulation and anguish, proud of the false feeling of 'marjad', crushed under the curse of indebtedness, Til Mole moves on a path full of swings, the peasants of Indian society are so relaxed And it is shabby, it is seen directly in Godan
 nagaron ke kolahalamay chakachaundh ne gaanvon kii vibhuti ko kaise dhank liya he, jameendaar, mil maalik, patrasampadak, adhyaaapak, peshewar vakil or doctor, raajnneetik netaa or rajkarmchaaree jonk bane kaise gaanv ke is nirih kisaan kaa shoshan kar rahe hai or kaise gaanv ke hi mahajan or purohit unki sahaayta kar rahe hai, godaan main ye sabhi tatv nakhdarpan ke samaan pratyaksh ho gaye hai
 Godan is, in fact, a living portrait of India of the third and fourth centuries of the 20th century, as we find elsewhere rare
 godaan main bahut si baaten kahi gai hai
 It seems that Premchand has wanted to fill all his life with satire and humor, cuss and anguish, rebellion and disinterest, experience and respect in this one novel
 kuch alaachakon ko isi kaaran usamen astavyastata milti he
 His plot seems lax, uncontrollable and very dramatic from place to place

 Premchand has written in one place - 'in the novel, show your power as much power as you can in your pen, argue on politics, write 10-20 pages in the description of a gathering, no corruption
 ' premchand ne godaan main apni kalam kaa puraa jor dikhaaya he
 Premchand has his own special skills to present the appropriate contextualization, proper reasoning and correct psychological analysis in all things fluent, agile and sound language and style, and hardly a novel writer can be compared to him
 jis samay premachand kaa janm hua vah yug saamaajik-dharmik rudhiwaad se bharaa hua tha
 Premchand himself was also impressed by this orthodoxy
 jab apane katha-sahitya kaa safar shuru kiya anekon prakaar ke rudhiwaad se grast samaaj ko yathashakti kala ke shastr dwaara mukt karaane kaa sankalp liya
 Announcing through the child of his story that he said, "I am not a slave to futile stereotypes and futile bonds
" " Premchand and exploitation can be considered as a very old relationship
 kyonki bachapan se hi shoshan ke shikaar rahe premachand isse acchhee tarah waakif ho gaye the
 Classism has always been prevalent in the society

 He says that the more difficulties people face in living in society, the greater will be crime there
 agar samaaj main log khushhaal honge to samaaj main achchhai zyada hogi or samaaj main gunaah nahin ke baraabar hoga
 Premchand made every effort to raise the people of the exploited class
 unhone aawaaj lagaai "e logon jab tumhen sansar main rahanaa he to jindon kii tarah raho, murdon kii tarah jinda rahane se kya phayda
 " premachand ne apni kahaniyon main shoshak-samaaj ke vibhinn virgon kii karatuuton va hathkandon kaa pardaafash kiya he
 Novels are considered to be of the highest order in which there is complete harmony of ideal and reality
 'godaan' main samaantar rup se chalane vaali dono kathaayen hai - ek graamy katha or duusari nagari katha, lekin in dono kathaon main paraspar sambaddhta tathaa santulan paaya jaataa he
 Both these stories are strong features, not the weakness of this novel
 yadi hamen tatkaaleen samay ke bharat varsh ko samajhnaa he to hamen nishchit rup se godaan ko padhnaa chahie isamen desh-kaal kii paristhitiyon kaa sateek varnan kiya gaya he
 The anguish of Katha Nayak Hori fills the minds of the readers
 sanyukt parivaar ke vighatan kii pidaa hori ko tod detii he parantu godaan kii ichha use jivit rakhti he or vah yah ichha man main liye hi vah is duniya se kooch kar jaataa he
 Godan is a story of the continuous exploitation of the farmer under colonial rule in the Mahajani system and the envy of it
 godaan kaa nayak hori ek kisaan he jo kisaan varg ke pratinidhi ke taur par maujuud he
 'despite the life-long struggle, his aspiration for a cow is not fulfilled'
 godaan bhartiya krishak jivan ke santrasamay sangharsh kii kahani he
 'godan' is the story of Hori, that Hori who works hard throughout his life, suffers many hardships, only because his dignity can be protected and that is why he also tries to keep others happy, but he does not bear the consequences
 Meets and in the end is forced, yet still does not save his dignity
 parinamtah vah jap-tap ke apane jivan ko hi home kar detaa he
 This is not the story of Hori, but an autobiography of every Indian farmer of that period
 or iske saath judi he shahar kii praasangik kahani
 In 'godan' he has presented such a real and balanced mixture of two stories of village and city
 donon kii kathaon kaa sanghathan itani kushalta se hua he ki usamen pravaah adyopant bana rahata he
 This is the speciality of Premchand's pen
 is rachana main premachand kaa gandhivaad se mohabhang saaf-saaf dikhaai padataa he
 In Premchand's earlier novels, where idealism is seen, realism is reflected in naked form in Godan

 Purebred naturally evolved region specific wild species can be threatened with extinction in a big way through the process of genetic pollution i

 In agriculture and animal husbandry, the use of the Green Revolution popularized traditional hybridization by making multiple layers to increase yield "high yielding varieties"
 The handful of plants and cattle breeds often hybridized in developed countries and hybridized with further localized varieties In the rest of the developing world, high-yield strains were resistant to local climates and diseases

due to complete disuse because of un-profitability and uncontrolled intentional and unintentional cross-pollination and crossbreeding ) formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread genetic erosion and genetic pollution resulting in great loss in genetic diversity and biodiversity as a whole
 A] is an organism whose gene tick content has been altered using this genetic engineering technique commonly known as recombinant DNA technology
 Genetically modified crops today are not only a common source for genetic contamination of wild varieties, But also other domesticated varieties have become relatively derived from natural hybridization
 It is being said that genetic erosion coupled with genetic pollution is destroying that needed unique genetic base thereby creating an unforeseen hidden crisis which will result in a severe threat to our food security for the future when diverse genetic material will cease to exist to be able to further improve or hybridize weakening food crops and livestock against more resistant diseases and climatic changes
 Conservation of this biodiversity has become a global concern
 haalanki nahin har koi seemaa he or vartmaan vilupt hone ke mahatv par sahamat hai, zyaadaatar jaev vividhta aavashyak maanate hai
 There are basically two main types of conservation options, in-situ conservation and in-situ preservation
 In-situ is generally seen as an ideal conservation strategy
 haalaanki, iske karyanvayan kabhi kabhi avyavhaarya he
 For example, destruction of rare or endangered species' habitat sometimes requires prior conservation efforts around it
 In addition, the former can provide a backup solution for in-situ conservation — in situ conservation projects
 Both types of some conservation

 Bioprospecting can be a type of biopiracy when those principles are not respected Not

 Jesus is one of the 25 prophets of Islam mentioned in the Quran
 islamic dharamshastra ke anusaar, isa ko mohammad ke baad dusre sabase mahatvapurn sthaan par rakhaa jaataa he
 Almost all of the divine events associated with his autobiography in the Bible are considered in Islam, including: birth from virgin, his miracles, his crucifixion, death and resurrection
 haalaanki quran ke kuch vivochanon ke anusaar, cross par chadhaanaa, mrityu or mritotthana jaaysi ghatnaayen nahin hui thi
 However, Muslims against Christians do not consider Jesus to be a godhead or trinity
 islam main isa messiah ko ek aadarneey nabi mana jaataa he, jo ishwar ne israeliyon ko unke sandesh failaane ko bheja tha
 According to the Quran, Allah gave Jesus the Book of Evil Salt Holy Book, which according to Islamic belief, is one of the four holy books provided by Allah to humanity
 quran main isa ke naam kaa zikr mohammad se bhi zyaada he or musulmaan isa ke kunwari mata dwaara janma maanate hai
 In Islam, Jesus, like all prophets, is considered a mere mortal, and, like Christian belief, is not considered a god-son or member of the Trinity, and their worship is forbidden
 unhen chamatkaar karne kii kshamta ishwar se mili thi or swayan isa main aisi shaktiyaan nahin maujuud thim
 It is also not believed that he hung on the cross
 islamic parampara ke mutabiq, cross par marane ke ba-vajood, ishwar ne unhen sidhe swarg main uthaaya gaya tha
 Like all prophets, Jesus Christ has been called a Muslim in the Quran
 quran ke mutabiq, isa ne apane aap ko ishwar-putr kabhi nahin mana or ve qayamat ke din par is baat kaa inkaar karenge
 The Muslims believe that on the Day of Judgment, Jesus Christ will return to earth and exercise justice

 The Qur'an mentions Jesus more than Muhammad
 islam main isa kaa cross par chadhana, mrityu or unka punaragaman bahut mahatv rakhata he adhikansh muslmaan, unki mrityu or punaragaman ko nahin maanate
 a large number of Muslims believe that these verses of the Quran, which mention the death of Christ, are just idioms
 adhinaansh ulema kaa kahana he ki messiah ke cross par nahin chadhaaya gaya tha, balki unhen jananath main uthaa liya gaya
 While some other Ulema believe that after his death, he was resurrected by God and then taken to Jannat
 lekin is par sabhi musalmaan ulema kii sahmati he ki messiah qayamat samay, punah dharti par aaenge or ishwar kii ichha ke anusaar dharti par islam lagu karenge
