 In the beginning, Surah blames the multi-religious people of Arabia, as well as the Ahl al-kitab people, who have departed from the faith, ie Jews and Christians
 However, they may be restored only by a "clear sign" from God who speaks holy and untainted words - the Prophet Muhammad bringing the Qur'an, which lays down proper laws and morality
 The fifth ayat explains that all God asks of mankind is, "to praise God by offering Him devotion being true, to pray the salat, and to give charity
 And that is the Religion of Truth
" Those to cling to these simple truths will be offered the Gardens of Paradise, "underneath which rivers flow" as their prize; for God is pleased with them for being the best of possible creations
 Those who turn away, however, shall meet the fires of Hell

 It was prevalent in India at the time of the Suras and the Mughals
 saadhaanat: zabt, parantu kabhi-kabhi zabti tathaa jareeb yaa 'amal-e-jareeb' kehalaati thi
 According to Abul Fazl, Sur Raja Sher Shah and Islam Shah were the promoters of this method

 vah rajasav pehle jins main hi liya jaataa tha, taduparant tatkaaleen mulyon ke aadhaar par nakad main parivartit kar diya jaataa tha
 Change was indeed a source of corruption and inefficiency
 astu, akbar ne bhoomi rajasav ko nakad main hi nirdhaarit karaayaa
 After a detailed inspection of the yield and prevailing price rates of the then ten years, the cash land revenue per bigha was determined in each region for different crops
 zabt main bhoomi rajasav, boi hui araaji dastur se guna karke nakad nirdhaarit hota tha
 The rituals, which used to change from time to time, often applied without looking at rates of yield and prices per year
 daivi vipatti padane par maang main katautee, bina dastur main parivartan ke aapattigrast kshetra ko araaji main se ghataakar kiya jaataa tha
 It seems that in reality, the land was not metered every year, but only by voluntarily changing the numbers of earlier years

 Soil scientists are concerned about how to protect the soil and cultivable land with the increase in world population
 mitti ko manushya anadikaal se jaanata he
 The earth, on which he plows, the field in which he grows crops and the house in which he lives, all remind us of soil
 kintu mitti ke sambandh main hamaara gyaan praaia: nahin ke baraabar he
 It is known that grains and fruits grow in the soil and this yield can be increased by the use of fertilizers and fertilizers, but about the other characteristics of the soil from which we build roads, buildings, runways and fences, our Knowledge is very less
 mitti ke vyavhaar ko bhalee prakaar se samajhane ke liye mitti ke rasinic or bhautik sanghatan kaa gyaan aavashyak he
 Physically, the soil has three components, sand, silt and clay
 ret sthool avyav he, jisamen na keshikatv hota he or na sansanjan
 The sand particles range in size from 0
05 mm 0 to 2 mm 0
 silt ke kan ret se bhi sookshm hotesh he
 They range in size from 0
05 mm 0 to 0
002 mm 0
 ret or sil donon niskriy padaarth hai
 The third important component is clay, whose particles are smaller than 0
002 mm 0
 ret, silt or mrittika main pramukh antar yah he ki jahaan ret or silt niskriy hote hen, vahaan mrittika rasayanat: sakriy hoti he
 The composition of soil is largely dependent on the percentage of these ingredients
 ret, silat or mrittika kii adhikta hone par mitti ko kramash: retili, silti or matiyaar kehete hai
 These components are called physical analysis per cent determination
 retili mitti kii banaavat khuli hoti he, jisase vaayu sanchaaran paryaapt hota he or yadi matiyaar bhaag main khanij padaartho kii maatra yathesht ho to yah mitti kheti ke liye adhik upyukt he
 Matiyar soil shrinks enough when it dries and also swells with enough water
 aisi mitti na to krishi ke liye acchhee hoti he or na makaan banane ke liye
 Open-textured soils are good for agriculture due to lack of compaction, as water can enter mineral salts by entering additional sites; But this soil is not good for engineering work, because the soil must be dense due to water penetration
 mitti jitani saghan hogi, uski daav prabalata or dridhtaa bhi utani adhik hogi
 The density of solidity actually depends on the amount of humidity
 kisi vishisht prakaar kii mitti ke liye ardrata kii jo pratishtata adhiktam saghanta pradaan karti he, vah us mitti kii ishtatam ardrata kahi jaati he
 The optimum humidity is lower for heavy roller than light roller
 jis mitti main nimna aakaar ke kanon kaa sanmishran acha hota he, uskaa ghanatv ucchtam hota he
 To maintain the strength of condensed soil, it is necessary that it is resistant to the softening effect of water
 iske liye mitti main cement, chuunaa, rasayanak yaa bitumani padaarth milaate hai
 It has already been reported that the soil mainly consists of sand, silt and clay
 inke saath hi usamen kuch viley or kuch aviley lavan bhi rahete hai, jaise calcium tathaa magneshium ke carbonate or sodium evam potacium ke chloride tathaa sulphate
 Organic materials of varying concentrations also exist in many forms
 ye sabhi mitti ke rasinic vyavhaar ko prabhavit karte hai
 As stated earlier, sand and silt are inert and the clay is chemically active, so the chemical properties of clay are dependent on the clay
 mrittika anek tatwon, jaise loh, aluminium, silicon aadi kii jatil sanrachana ke rup main bani he
 Some properties of mineral composite of clay are unique
 yah pani main aviley hota he, par usamen nilambit avasthaa main rah saktaa he
 It remains suspended depending on the size of the particles
 nilambit avasthaa main yah amleey abhikriya detaa he
 Its acidity is acidity of acetic acid
 is amlata kaa udaasinikaran calcium or sodium ke hydroxide sadyash kisi kshareey padaarth se kiya ja saktaa he
 As a result, calcium and sodium soils are formed
 daanedaar sanrachana ke kaaran calsicham mitti krishi kesh liye upyukt he, par sodium mitti jalaabhedh hone ke kaaran band or sadakon ke nirmaan ke liye adhik upyogi he
 Calcium ion is absorbed by the soil and stabilized so that it dissolves by pure water but is easily replaced by other salts
 udhaaharan ke liye calcium mitti ko jab namak ke vilyan se apkshalit kiya jaataa he, tab usase sodium mitti banati he or calcium ayan chloride ke rup main vilyan main aa jaataa he
 Sodium soil can then be converted into calcium, or other metals of clay, by bleaching it with calcium, or other clay solutions
 mitti ke is gun ko, jisamen kshaaron kaa vinimay hota he, " mittish kaa vinimay gun' kehete hai or vinimay hone vaala dhanayan vaali mittiyaan hoti hai, jinamein calcium, sodium, potacium tathaa mangneshium pramukh hai or nickel, cobalt, boran aadi badi alp maatra main rahete hai, yadhyapi paudhon kii vruddhi ke liye ye aavashyak hai
 These elements living in microscopic quantities are called Anuposha "tattva"
 kisi mrid bhaag main dhanayan kaa pratishat vinimay dharita par nirbhar karata he, jo maantmarilonite koti kii mitti main adhik or keolinite koti kii mitti main kam hoti he
 The example of montmorillonite grade soil is cotton black soil, which is spread in Madhya Pradesh, Madras and parts of Bombay in India
 keolinite mitti saadharantya bharat ke jalodh maidaanon main pai jaati he
 As indicated earlier, the soil that is highly depleted of interchangeable alkali by treatment with dilute acid has the highest hydrogen ion concentration and consequently the lowest ph
 jyon jyon mitti main sodium calcium jaise vinimeya ayan milaae jate hai, tyon tyon uskaa pi ech badhata jaataa he
 The highest ph of soil reaches about 11
 vaastavik kshetra paristhiti main isse kuch adhik pi ech dekha gaya he, kintu uskaa kaaran vinimeya dhanayan nahin hai, balki sodium carbonate jaisaa viley lavan he, jo kshareey mitti main saadharantaya rahata he
 Exceeding a certain limit of such salts prevents the growth of crops
 lekin ejiniyari sanrachana ke liye mitti main sodium carbonate kaa hona laabhadaayak hota he
 The presence of these salts transforms soil sodium into soil, which in the ground state has greater water resistance than calcium soil
 falat: nam avasthaa main bhi mitti kii shakti bani rahati he, jo ejiniyari sanrachana ke liye aavashyak he
 The three main components of natural land are sand, silt and clay
 inke kanon ke aakaar main to antar he hi, inke rasinic tathaa bhautik gun bhi bhinn hai
 The sand is generally made of silica and rhinestone
 silica or sphatik niskriy hote hai
 The size of the sand ranges from 0
06 mm 0 to 2 mm 0
 ret ke kanon main sansanjan or keshikatv nahin hota, kintu pargamyata adhik hoti he
 The components of silt are silica and crystalline, but the size of its particles varies from 0
0002 mm 0 to 0
06 mm 0
 silt ke kanon main sansanjan nahin hota, lekin keshikatv kaaphi hota he
 The size of soil particles is less than 0
002 mm 0
 ret or silt se isaki asamanta yah he ki mitti ke kan rasayanat: aavisht hone ke kaaran rasayanakon sa abhikriya karte hai
 The excess of soil brings capillarity and cohesion in the soil
 aisi bhoomi geeli hone par phoolati he tathaa sookhne par sikudti he
 These apparent physical properties of the soil are due to the high percentage of colloidal particles in it, causing the adsorption of hydrogen, sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, etc
 from the surface
 ye ayan vinimeya hai, arthath vilyan main ye duusare ayanon se pratisthapaneey hai
 The highest ability to adsorb these ions is called the exchange capacity of alkali
 ayanon kii ksharak bhi utana hi adhik hoga
 The properties of the soil depend on the adsorbed cation on the surface
 bhinn bhinn mittiyon ke rasinic avyav ek hi hai, arthath maatra main, ,, ke saath, , tathaa jal, kintu bhinnn mittiyon main khanij yogic bhinn hote hai
 X-rays and homogeneous rock analysis of many scientists The X-rays and homogeneous rock analysis experiments of many scientists have resulted in two groups of clay minerals
 vargeekaran kaa aadhaar crystal jaalak kii banaavat he
 See - Ceramic is samooh ke khanij silica or alumina ke ek ek chaadaron se bane hote hai
 The crystal lattice of the mineral of this group is made of two unit silica sheets and one unit alumina sheet
 crystal jaalak sanrachana kii bhinnata ke falswaroop in do samoohon kii mittiyon ke rasinic tathaa bhautik gunon main mahaan antar hota he
 The alkali regulation holdings of kaolin minerals are low and their adsorption properties are also low, while the cation-adsorption of montmalonite minerals occurs
 bharat ke mitti samoohon main pradhan kapaas kii kaali mitti, jo praaia: samast madhya tathaa dakshin bharat main chai hui he, maantmarilonite samooh kii he
 Its main property is shrinking and spreading, which is a problem of building and road construction
 idhar kii khoj se siddh hua he ki mote chooney se abhikriya karaane par mitti kaa phoolnaa bahut kuch kam ho jaataa hai
 You can use Ashvinimudra to get everlasting life
 pranayam ko sarv uplabdh amrit kii sangya di ja sakati he
 If there is any action to be easily accessible in this universe in yoga, then it is pranayama
 iske nit upyog se shaareerik urja kii vruddhi, rog pratirodh kshamta kii badhotaree, aadhyatmik anubhuti, maansikavikaron kaa samaapan aadi anek laabh prakruti ke is vardaan se mil sakate hai
 In this compound action, the need is only time and persistence, which is also usually more needed in the beginning
 kuch samay uparaant iske laabh kaa gyaan va anubhav, ise karne vaale par itnaa prabhaav chhodte hai ki phir use nahin karne kaa man bananaa ishwariya prakope athwa durbhaagya ke suchak ke atirikt sambhav nahin he

 It should be increased day by day and the amount of pranayama should also be increased
 saamaanya vyakti ke liye yah kriya uski umr ke varshon main 5 jodne tak karne par purna laabh hota he
 For example, if the condition is 35 years, then the action should be done up to 35 + 40 times
 itnaa hone par iske laabh milanaa prarambh ho jate hai

 Bhima Nayaka, the son of Seva Lal's father Ramji Nayak, was a very big businessman

 There used to be a union of these 52 Bheru and 64 Jogani

 Historical documents have shown that Bhima Nayak with the British cost 2 lakh rupees
 Had a merchant agreement

 According to the state position of the 17th century, we can say that, the influence and power of the British power was increasing day by day and the system of Indian kings was getting weaker
 angreji hukumat kaa gore banjaaraa vyapaaree par raajaaon ko rasad pahunchane ke khilaaf dabaav badhate ja rahaa tha
 And the British tax-affected Gor Banjara merchants were being charged with tax collection which was against the merchant rules of Gor Banjara
 is kar vasuli ke khilaaf prastaav lekar sevaalaal apane sabhi sangh nayakon ke saath nizaam se milane gayi
 Fearing the British rule, the Nizam turned down the proposal, in view of this Sevlal declared war against the Nizam
 phir hyderabad main yuddh hua or parinamswarup nizaam ne sevaalaal kii sabhi sharte manjur kii or bharat ke anya rajyon ke karpranali ke liye dilli ke badshaah gulam khan ko milane kii salaah di
 Sevlal accepted the Nizam's advice and accepted the honor given by the Nizam
 sammaan ke taur par nizaam ne tamrapatr, talwaar or bhetwastu di
 These Bhetavastuans still exist in the Pohragadh temple
 dilli ke badshaah gulam khan ne is prastaav ko naamanjur kiya, parinaam swarup sevaalaal ne yuddh kaa elaan kiya, gulam khan ke 25000 sainikon kaa muqabla sevaalaal ke 900 yauddhaon ne kiya
 Historians never mentioned this war, Ghulam Khan lost heavily
 gulam khan ne karpranali ko maaf karne ko manjur kiya
 This was a huge political victory for Sevlal from a business point of view
 is jeet ke chalate sevaalaal kaa naam puure bharat varsh main prasiddh hua
 Gaurbanjara of Lahore honored Sevlal
 jaipur ke banjaaraa vyapaaree or bahujan logon kii pukaar par sevaalaal ne bhumia naamak dahshatagrast kaa shirched kiya or rajasthanvaasiyon ko bhumia se mukti dilaai

 The strength and wisdom of Sevlal can be ascertained from the fact that the prophecies that Sevlal had about the social and economic and natural state of India are coming true after 250 years

 The Vedas have a total of one lakh mantras - four thousand in the knowledge scandal, sixteen thousand in worship and in the eighty thousand rituals
 isliye karmkand ko pradhan sthaan praapt he
 Thus the Veda has three parts
 ‘‘teen cond ekatv shaan - veda
 In the ritual part of the Vedas, Yajnadi rituals are specially described, so the Yajna ritual is the main subject of the Vedas
 vedon kaa mukhya vishay hone ke kaaran karmkand main mantron kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Vedas cannot be ritual without mantras and mantras cannot be properly used without rituals
 atah spasht he ki veda hai to karmkand he or karmkand he to veda hai
 The description comes in the Vishnu Dharmottara Purana: Vedastu Yajnartha Mabhipravritta
 is vachan se tathaa bhagwaan manu ke dudoh yajna siddhyami 1 / 23 is vaakya se spasht siddh he ki vedon kaa pradurbhaav karmkand, yajna, anushthan ke liye hua he
 Just as the Vedas are arrogant, similarly the Vedang Bhoota ritual is also very difficult
 jis prakaar veda main upasya devtaa hai usee prakaar karmkand main bhi upasya devtaa hai
 Just as Vedas were not created by any man

 veda ko banane vaala koi nahin he
 Chaturmukh Brahma remembered the Veda
 thik usee prakaar yajna anushthan, karmkand bhi aporushey, nity or anadi hai
 In the first mantra of the Rigveda, 'agnimidae Purohitam', Yajna has come, so it is proved that there is an ancient ritual even than Veda
 karmkand vaidic samskruti kaa pradhan ang he
 All human desires are proved by ritual
 karmkand, manushyon kii icchit kaamana evam kalyaan va loukik sukh-shanti tathaa man main sankalpit anekanek ichchhaaon ko purna karata he
 All the religions that our religious leaders have said to man are all combined with ritualistic traits
 The ancient sage Maharishi made his life sacrificial according to the scriptures
 ve yajna karmkand dwaara apana or jagat kaa kalyaan kiya karte the
 Virtually there is an extraordinary power in ritual
 'karmkand se jo jis vastu kii prapti ke liye ichha karata he vah usko vahi vastu detaa he
 "" Yo agachachti tasya tat "
 12 / 16 atah spasht he ki sansar main aisi koi vastu nahin he jo karmkand ke dwaara praapt na ho sake
 From rituals, not only things like cosmic, wealth, child, etc
, but also things from above worldly 'salvation' are also obtained
 is shreshth karm ke vidhi-vidhaan bhi atyant kathin hai
 The ritual has three special parts
 1
 candy 2
 pindi va 3
 chandi candy : havan se purv jo karm hai vah candy hai
 Pindi: The Pindadi activity that takes place in Shraddha is called Pindi
 chandi: bhagwati durga ji kii upasna ke jo anushthan va anya kriyaayein hai unako chandi kehete hai
 The practitioner who is well acquainted with these three parts of rituals, who has received education from the Guru tradition, may be entitled to perform rituals and be called Acharya
 ‘‘shram matrik kevalan’’ vah sirf shram maatr he
 It has been said that the ritual rituals performed by the Brahmin in the rituals, who perform regular evening prayers, Vedapathi and routine, only flourish

 Gandhakamal makes salts, called sulfates
 salphet saamaanya yaa udasin lavan hote hai, jaise saamaanya sodium salphet yaa amleey sodium biselphet 
 Acidic because it still contains a hydrogen, which can be replaced by alkalis
 dhaatuon, dhaatuon ke oxidon, hydoxidon, carbonato yaa anya lavenon par amla kii kriya se salphet bate hai
 Most sulfates are soluble
 keval calcium, barium, straunsium or sis ke lavan jal main aviley yaa bahut kam viley hote hai
 Many salts are of industrial importance
 barium or sis salphet varnak ke rup main, sodium salphet kaagaj nirmaan main, copper salphet kitnashak ke rup main or calcium salphet plaster ov paris ke rup main prayukt hote hai
 There is no action of concentrated acid on sis and steel

 Small quantities of sulfur can be prepared in laboratories in the following three ways: gandhak trioxide ko jal main ghulaane se, By the direct action of hydrogen peroxide and sulfur dioxide - vaayu ke sansarg main salfuras amla ke vilyan ke mand oxikaran se
 At the industrial level, acid is produced by sis-chamber method and contact method
 sansparsh vidhi main gandhak athwa aayran salphid sadrush kisi salphid ke dahan se sulfur dioxide pehle banataa he or vah platinum dhatuyukt esbestas utprerak kii upasthiti main vaayu ke oxigen dwaara gandhak trioxide main parinat ho jaataa he, jo jal main ghulkar gandhakaml banataa he
 In this method, acid is formed by the oxidation of sulfur dioxide by nitric acid in the presence of water
 yah kriya-bade bade sis kakshon main sampann hoti he at: iskaa naam 'sis-kaksh-vidhi' padaa he
 This method was used to make a large amount of sulfuric acid, but it has some shortcomings due to which the contact process has now replaced it

 From the top of this column, a mixture of sulfur and nitrosyl sulfur is available
 stambh se nikalakar gas mishran sis kaksh main pravesh karata he
 Generally, SIS chambers remain three
 yahan kaksh main bhaap bhi pravesh karata he
 Acting between the gas mixture and the steam, it forms a sulfuric acid, which collects in the bottom of the chamber
 avshisht gaise ab ge-lusac stambh main pravesh karti hai
 They mainly contain nitrogen oxides
 ge-lusac stambh coke yaa pathar ke tukdon se bharaa rahata he
 The sulfurium drips from the top and slowly falls due to blockage, absorbing nitrogen oxides, nitrosyl sulfur is formed and used in the glover column

 It can give any concentration of acid
 is vidhi main gandhak ko jalaakar, athwa pirietiess ko uttapt kar, gandhak dwizarkik praapt hota he
 It is mixed with air and brought to the catalyst, where sulfur is combined with oxygen from the secondary air to form sulfur trioxide
 gandhak trioxide ko sandra gandhakaml main avashoshit karaane se "olium' praapt hota he
 The desired concentration of acid is obtained by the reaction of oleum with water
 utprerak ke rup main pehle sookshm vibhajit platinum prayukt hota tha
 It was very expensive
 jab platinum ke sthaan main vanadium pentoxide prayukt hota he, jo platinum kii apeksha bahut sasta hota he
 In order to reduce the reactivity of the catalyst, it is necessary that sulfur dioxide is absolutely free from arsenic, ash and dust particles
 at: gandhak dwizarkik ke chaanane kaa prabandh rahata he or use aise padaarthon dwaara paarit kiya jaataa he jinamein arsenic purnataya nikal jaae
 If the gas is not purified, the catalyst's functionality may soon be lost
