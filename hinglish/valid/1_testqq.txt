 Prior to Ernest Rutherford's theory of atomic structure, the presence of atoms in matter could be detected, but the information about the atom was further accelerated by Ernest Rutherford's experiments

 in parmaanuon kaa swatantra astitv sambhav he
 The experiments of scientists Thomson and Rutherford after Dolton improved Dolton's theory
 He made it clear that the atom is not inseparable but it consists of small charged particles
 1897 main sar thamsan ne parmaanu ke andar dhanaveshit kan kii upasthiti pramanit kii
 By that time, positive particles present inside the atom were said to remain in the scattered state inside the atom, such as cardamom seeds in Bundi laddus or its seeds inside water melon or dry fruits in Christmas pudding
 arnest radarford kaa vaigyanik dimag parmaanu ke andar electron kii is tarah kii vyakhya se santusht nahin tha, santushti ke liye unhone kai or prayog kiye
 In 1911, he conducted an experiment to find the structure inside the atom in which he passed some alpha rays out of a thin gold foil placed in front of the screen in a vacuum
 prayog ke parinaam aashcharya chakit karne vaale the
 By far the prevailing theory about the atom, alpha particles should have collided across the gold foil at the same place on the screen, but Rutherford noticed that some alpha particles collided with the gold foil and were returning at different angles
 And some were also crossing it
 radarford ke prayog ne spasht kar diya ki parmaanu ke madhya kuch ghanaa dhanatmak bhaag he jisase alpha kan waapas laut rahe the
 By experiment they proved that this positive dense part is the 'nucleus' of the atom, in this nucleus the entire mass of the atom remains centered and the electrons revolve around this positive charge systematically

 If seen, the Tropic of Cancer passes through the middle of India, but it is the effect of the Himalayas that the indo-gangetic plains north of the Tropic of Cancer also have a tropical climate
 duusari ore thar kaa marusthal greeshm ritu main tapt ho kar nimna vayudab kendra ke rup main monsooni hawaaon ko aakrisht karata he jisase varsha hoti he
 In fact, India's expansion and geomorphic diversity have such an impact on India's climate that India's climate cannot be normalized
 copen ke vargeekaran main bharat main chah prakaar kii jalwaayu kaa nirupan he kintu yahan yah bhi dhyatavya he ki bhu-akruti ke prabhaav main chote or sthaneey str par bhi jalwaayu main bahut vividhta or vishistataa milti he
 The climate of India is tropical in the south and due to the high altitude in the Himalayan regions, Alpine is on one side and it is of tropical moist type in northeast India and dry type in western parts
 copen ke vargeekaran ke anusaar bharat main nimnlikhit chah prakaar ke jalwaayu pradesh paae jate hai: Traditionally six seasons have been considered in India, but the Indian Meteorological Department describes four seasons which we can write as comparatively below their traditional names: bharat main jal sansaadhan kii uplabdhta kshetreey str par jivan-style or samskruti ke saath judi hui he
 At the same time substantial disparity exists in its distribution
 ek adhyayan ke anusaar bharat main 71% jal sansaadhan kii maatra desh ke 36% kshetrafal main simati he or baaki 64% kshetrafal ke paas desh ke 29% jal sansaadhan hi uplabdh hai
 However, looking at the total numbers, the demand for water in the country seems to be less than the supply
 2008 main kiye gayi ek adhyayan ke mutabik desh main kul jal uplabdhta 654 billian cubic meter thi or tatkaaleen kul maang 634 billian cubic meter
 
 saath hi kai adhyayanon main yah bhi spasht kiya gaya he ki nikat bhavishya main maang or purti ke bich antar chintajanak rup le saktaa he kshetreey aadhaar par vitaran ko bhi isamen shaamil kar liya jaae to samasya or badhegi
 However, the amount of water in these rivers also does not remain the same throughout the year
 bharat main nadiyon ko jodne kii mahatvakankshi yojana bhi bani ja rahi he jisamen se kuch ke to propozal bhi ban chuke hai
 Looking at the statistics of the whole of India, we see the water crisis as a thing of the future, but the situation is not like this
 kshetreey rup se bharat ke kai ilaake pani kii kami se jujh rahe hai
 This problem has become common in big cities
 pani ki uplabdhta se aashay keval pani ki maatra se liya jaataa he jabaki isamen pani kii gunvattta kaa bhi samavesh kiya janaa chaiye
 Today, most of India's rivers are polluted and ground water is also being polluted
 may-june 2014 main bharat sarkaar ne ek alag mantralay bana kar sabase pehle bhartiya nadi ganga ke 'shuddhikaran' kii mahatvakankshi yojana shuru kii he
 Like elsewhere, the distribution of ground water in India is not uniform everywhere
 bharat ke pathari bhaag hameshaa se bhoojal ke maamle main kamjor rahe hai
 Here groundwater is found in some special geological formations such as fault basins and cracks
 uttari bharat ke jalodh maidan hameshaa se bhoojal main sampann rahe hai lekin ab uttari pashchimi bhaagon main sinchai hetu teji se dohan ke kaaran inamen abhootpurv kami darj kii gai he
 Concerns are being raised about the situation of water bodies and ground water in India
 jis tarah bharat main bhoojal kaa dohan ho rahaa he bhavishya main sthitiyaan kaaphi khatarnaak hosakati hai
 At present, 29% of the development blocks are either at a pathetic level of ground water or are worrying and according to some statistics, by 2025, about 60% of the blocks will come up with worrisome conditions
 dhyatavya he ki bharat main 60% sinchai etu jal or lagbhag 85% peya jal kaa strot bhoojal hi he, aise main bhoojal kaa teji se girtaa str ek bahut badi chunauti ke rup main ubhar rahaa he
 The ancient history of urbanization in India begins with the cities of the Indus Valley Civilization

 Details of settling of cities like Delhi, Daulatabad, Jaunpur, Hyderabad, Allahabad etc
 are available in the medieval period
 dakshin bharat ke kai nagar cher chol or pandya raajaaon dwaara basaaye gayi jo kala samskruti or vyaper ke samrudh kendra the
 During the colonial period, tourist towns like Calcutta, Madras, Daman, Diu, Pondicherry etc
 and Shimla, Mussoorie, Darjeeling, Ooty, Pachmarhi etc
 developed as a summer residence

 Cities in India are divided into categories called urban villages, towns, cities and metros

 Cities with a population of more than one million are kept in class-i and are called Mahanagar or Daslakhi Nagar

 Note: The timetable can be sorted alphabetically and periodically using the "↓" sign upbhasha vigyaan yaa boli vigyaan bhashavigyaan kii ek he shakha jo boliyon ko bhugolic vitaran or vyakaran kii drushti se apane adhyayan kaa lakshya banaati he
 Considering geographical distribution, social classes, ethnic levels, occupational diversity and religious, cultural characteristics are also taken into consideration
 in sab ke atirikt boli vigyaan kaa ek lakshya or bhi he jise koshvigyaan kaa ang mana jaataa he
 In this, the words of different dialects are stored in phonetic transcription and their signal limits are explained
 bhashaa or boli ke bich kii bhedakarekha "paraspar bodhgamyata" ke anusaar nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 There are four levels of this comprehension - purna bodhgamyata, apurna bodhgamyata, aanshik bodhgamyata, shunya bodhgamyata Based on these levels of comprehension, individual categories, sub-language, dialect and language categories are classified
 purna bodhgamyata ek boli kshetra ke rahanevaale vyaktiyon kii praaia: samaan vakpravriti kaa sanket detii he
 The latest belief in descriptive linguistics is that not every person's eloquence is exactly the same
 kintu yah asamanta itani sthool nahin hoti ki ve ek duusare kii baat na samaj saken
 In this way, the coordinated form of individual eloquences is the individual form and the coordinated form of the individual dialects is the subboli and the coordinated form of subboli
 isi prakaar boliyon kii samanvit ikai bhashaa he
 It is clear from the above assumption that different levels of comprehension are activated between the person dialect and language
 bhashaa ke adhyayan main adhiktar upboli ke str tak vichaar kiya jaataa he kintu boli ke sandarbh main vyaktiboliyon kaa bhi mahatv hota he
 At the linguistic level, there is a combination of person-language and sub-language and dialect and language-second
 jis prakaar boli or bhashaa yaa bhashaaon ke simavarti kshetron main rupavaishishty hote hue bhi ek duusare ko samajhnaa saral hota he, usee prakaar yaa usase bhi adhik bodhgamyata boli yaa upboli kii simaaon par hoti he
 Due to such intelligibility found in the border areas, no clear dividing line can be drawn between language and dialect or dialect or subpoena
 ek bhashiya kshetra main sthaneey bhedon ke adhyayan ko bluemfield ne boli bhugol kaa naam dete hue use tulanaatmak vidha kii uplabdhiyon kaa poorak bhi kaha he
 The study of dialects is most popular in the form of dialect atlas
 boli kshetra ke ye atlas maanchitron ke aise sankalan hai jinpar bhashiya rupavaishishtyon ko sthaneey vitaran ke aadhaar par samroop rekhaon ke madhyam se pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 Detailed features cannot be displayed on these maps
 keval bhedak rup hi pradarshit kiye jate hai
 That is why many people consider dialect grammar, demarcation of dialects, lexicography and comparative, historical findings only as a means of dialectology
 atlason ko bhashaa bhugol se sambhddha maanakar use boli vigyaan se pruthak kar dete hai
 There are three areas divided by identical lines: avshesh kshetra aise kshetra jahaan ke rahanevaale aarthik drushti se aviksit hote hai or jahaan kii bhugolic sthiti aisi ho ki aasaani se pahunch paanaa kathin ho, un kshetron main pracheenatam rup mil sakate hai
 Others often consider the forms of these places to be hey
 aakarshan kshetra - in kshetron main aarthik yaa audyogic drushti se koi mahatvapurn centre hota he
 This center is the source of the emergence of new forms

 Transition zone - One-time use of forms is not found in such areas
 samroop rekhaayen ek duusare ko katati hui jaati hai yaa unke bich kaa antar adhik hota he
 It can be said about the attraction areas that their forms must have been prevalent in this area from long ago and they have taken away their rival words from the position of behavior and have taken control over the whole area
 avshesh kshetra ke rup sab se puraane maane jate hai or sankraman kshetravaale rup is baat kaa sanket dete hai ki kisi vyavahaargat puraane rup ke upar kisi nae rup ko praathamikta mil rahi he
