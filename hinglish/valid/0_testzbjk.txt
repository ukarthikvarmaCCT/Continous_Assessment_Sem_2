 During his reign, Piru or Prithvi Gosain built a fort here named Pithoragarh
 kile ke naam par hi baad main iskaa naam pithauragarh hua
 The Chandas extended their authority over most of Kumaon where they ruled until the year 1790
 unhone kai kabeelon ko parrast kiya tathaa padosi raajaaon se yuddh bhi kiya taaki unki sthiti sudrudh ho jaay
 In the year 1790, the Gorkhas called Gorakhiyali ended the rule of the Chand dynasty by occupying Kumaon
 varsh 1815 main gorkha shaskaon ke shoshan kaa ant ho gaya jab east india company ne unhen parrast kar kumaun par apana aadhipaty sthapit kar liya
 According to Atkins, the total population of Pithoragarh in the year 1881 was 552
 angrezon ke samay main yahaan ek sainik chhavnee, ek carch tathaa ek mishan skool tha
 Christian missionaries were very active in this area
 varsh 1960 tak angrajon kii pradhanta sahit pithauragarh, almoda jile kaa ek tehsil tha jiske baad yah ek jila bana
 In the year 1997, a new district Champawat was carved out by cutting some parts of Pithoragarh and its border was reestablished
 varsh 2000 main pithauragarh naye rajya uttrakhand kaa ek bhaag ban gaya
 Tehri and Garhwal are named after this district by combining two different names
 jahaan tehri bana he shabd ‘trihari’ se, jiskaa arth he ek aisa sthaan jo teen prakaar ke paap dho detaa he vahiin doosraa shabd bana he ‘garh’ se, jiskaa matlab hota he kila
 Prior to 888, the entire Garhwal region was divided into smaller 'strongholds', in which different kings ruled, known as 'rana', 'rai' or 'thakur'
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki malwa ke rajkumaar kanakapaal ek baar badrinaath ji ke darshan ko gayi jahaan wo parakramee raja bhanu pratap se mili
 King Bhanu Pratap was very impressed by them and got his only daughter married to Kanakpal as well as gave him his kingdom
 dhire-dhire kanakapaal or unki aane vaali peediyaan ek-ek kar saare garh jeet kar apana rajya badaati gayin
 Thus by 1803, the entire Garhwal region came under their control
 unhi varshon main gorkhaon ke asafal hamale bhi hote rahe, lekin san 1803 main aakhir dehradun kii ek ladaai main gorkhaon kii vijay hui jisamen raja pradvamun shah maare gayi
 But his Shahzade, who was small at the time, was saved by the loyalists
 dhire-dhire gorkhaon kaa prabhutv badhata gaya or inhonen lagbhag 12 varshon tak raaj kiya
 Their kingdom extended to Kangra, then the Gurkhas were driven out of Kangra by Maharaja Ranjit Singh
 or idhar sudarshan shah ne east india company kii madad se gorkhaon se apana rajya punah chin liya
 The East India Company then merged Kumaon, Dehradun and erstwhile Garhwal into the British Empire and gave West Garhwal King Sudarshan Shah what was then known as Tehri Riyasat
 raja sudarshan shah ne apni rajdhani tehri yaa tehari nagar ko banaaya, baad main unke uttaradhikari pratap shah, kirti shah or narendra shah ne is rajya kii rajdhani kramshah pratap nagar, kirti nagar or narendra nagar sthapit kii
 All three ruled from 1815 to 1949
 tab bharat chodo andolan ke dauraan yahan ke logon ne bhi bahut badhachadh kar bhaag liya
 After independence, the desire of the people to be free from the rule of kings began to grow
 maharaja ke liye bhi ab raaj karnaa kathin hone laga tha
 And then in the end, the 60th King Manvendra Shah agreed to unite with India
 is prakaar san 1949 main tehri rajya ko uttar pradesh main milakar isi naam kaa ek jila bana diya gaya

 Manufactured wetlands include engineered reeds and many similar practices, all of which provide a high level of pneumatic biological improvement and can often be used in place of secondary treatment for small communities, see also - Phytoremediation
 An example of this is a small reeds land used to clean the drains of an elephant's courtyard in Chester Zoo, England
 apshisht jal main poshak tatwon ke nitrogen or phosphorus kii adhik maatra nihit ho saktaa he
 Excessive expulsion in the environment can lead to the formation of nutrients called eutrophication, which can lead to an overgrowth of weeds, algae and cyanobacteria
 isaki vajah se shaiwal falan ho saktaa he, arthath shaiwal kii sankhya main tezi se vruddhi hone lagati he
 The number of algae cannot be sustained for long and most of them eventually die

 In addition to deoxygenation, some species of algae produce toxic substances that contaminate drinking water supplies
 vibhinn prashodhan prakriyaaon ke liye nitrogen or phosphorus ko hataanaa aavashyak he
 The removal of nitrogen is effected through organic oxidation of nitrogen from ammonia to nitrate, followed by denitrification, ie reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas
 nitrogen gas ko vaataavaran main mukt kar diya jaataa he or is prakaar jal se hataa diya jaataa he
 Nitrification itself is a two-stage pneumatic process, in which each step is made spontaneous by different types of bacteria
 ammonia kaa nitrite main oxikaran ko sabase zyada praayah nitrosomonus esapeepi
 dwaara sahaj banaaya jaataa he 
 Nitrobacter spp
 In spite of the traditional belief that it is spontaneous, the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate is now often specifically Nitrospira spp
 Is known to be comfortable in the environment

 Since denitrification is the reduction of nitrate in denitrogen gas, an electron donor is needed
 apshisht jal ke aadhaar par yah carbonic padaarth, sulphide, yaa mithenul kii tarah kaa ek shaamil daata ho saktaa he
 The conversion of toxic ammonia to nitrate alone is sometimes referred to as tertiary treatment

 This is also particularly important for water reuse systems where more phosphorus concentrations can cause downstream equipment to degrade, such as reverse osmosis
 phosphorus ko jaivik taur par vardhit jaivik phosphorus nishkasana naamak ek prakriya main hataaya ja saktaa he
 In this process, specific bacteria called polyphosphate collecting organisms are selectively enriched and store a large amount of phosphorus within their cells
 jab in jeevanu main sangrahit jaev padaarthon ko prashodhit jal se alag kiya jaataa he, tab in jaev thos padaarthon kaa urvarak mulya kaaphi adhik hota he
 Phosphorus removal can also be carried out by chemical precipitation, usually with iron salts, aluminum, or lime
 isaki vajah se hydroxide talachat ke rup main bahut zyada keechad utpann ho saktaa he or milaae gaye rasayan mahange ho sakate hai
 Chemical phosphorus removal requires much smaller equipment than biological removal, making it easier to operate and often much more reliable than biological phosphorus removal {{{author}}}, {{{title} }},],] 

 Another method of removing phosphorus is the use of fine laterite
 phosphate yukt keechad ke rup main hataae jane ke baad is phosphorus ko kisi bhoomi bharan main jamaa karke rakhaa ja saktaa he yaa urvarak main istemaal karne ke liye ise phir se bechaa ja saktaa he
 The purpose of disinfection in the treatment of wastewater is to substantially reduce the number of microorganisms in the water that are released back into the environment

 Effluent will be less successful in treating turbid waters because solids can cover organisms, especially with ultraviolet light, or if they have a low frequency of contact
 aam taur par, kam sampark aavriti, kam maatra or ucch pravaah aadi sambhi kaarak prabhavi keetanushodhan main baadhak hote hai
 Common methods of disinfection include - ozone, chlorine, ultraviolet light, or sodium hypochlorite
 Chlorine is not used in wastewater treatment because of the continuum of chlorine used for drinking water
 chlorinikaran apni kam laagat or prabhaavashiltaa ke dirghakaalik itihaas kii vajah se uttar america main apshisht jal keetanushodhan kaa sabase aam rup bana hua he
 a disadvantage of this is that chlorination of residual organic matter can produce chlorine-containing organic compounds that can be carcinogenic or environmentally harmful
 avshish chlorine yaa chlormin main prakritik jaleey vaataavaran main carbonic padaarthon kaa chlorinikaran karne kii kshamta bhi ho sakati he
 In addition, since residual chlorine is toxic to aquatic species, treated wastewater must be chemically chlorinated, increasing the complexity and cost of treatment
 chlorine, iodine, yaa anya rasayanon kii jagah parabangnee prakaash kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Due to the non-use of chemicals, treated water has no adverse effect on organisms that consume it later, while with other methods, there may be other issues
 yuvi vikiran kii vajah se jeevanu, vishaanu or anya rogaanuon kii anuvanshik sanrachana kshatigrast ho jaati he jisase unamem prajnan shakti samaapt ho jaati he
 The major disadvantages of UV disinfection are the frequent maintenance and replacement of the lamps and the need for highly purified effluent to ensure that the targeted microorganisms are not shielded from UV radiation

 Deodorant emitted from sewage treatment is usually an indication of an anaerobic or "septic" condition
 prasanskaran ke praarambhik charnon main badboodaar gas, sabase aam taur par hydrogen sulphide, utpann hone lagate hai
 In large-scale processing plants in urban areas, these odors are often combined with carbon reactors, a contact media with bio-clay soils, small amounts of chlorine, or liquids to generate unpleasant gases biologically controlled and metabolized
 It is circulated and treated

 Pneumatic decomposition is a bacterial process that occurs in the presence of oxygen
 viviya paristhitiyon ke tahat, jeevanu teji se carbonic padaarthon kaa upbhog karata he or ise carbon dioxide main badal detaa he
 Operating costs for pneumatic decomposition are high because the energy used by the blowers, pumps, and motors requires oxygen in the process

 Many processes in a wastewater treatment plant are designed to mimic the natural treatment processes occurring in the environment, whether the environment is a natural water body or land
 If not overloaded, bacteria present in the environment will consume organic contaminants, although this will reduce oxygen levels in the water and can significantly alter the overall ecology of receiving water

 He composed many hymns in praise of Lord Venkateswara, the deity of the Tirumala Seven Mountains
 telegu bhashaa bhashi unako pad-kavita kaa pitamah maanate hai
 
 Most of the hymns of Annamacharya are full of spirituality
 annamacharya kaa janm baishakh shuddh poornima ko bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke kadappa jile ke ek gaanv main hua
 In praise of Lord Venkateswara, Annamacharya composed 32,000 hymns
 , lekin inamen mahaj 13000 rachanaaen hi is samay uplabdh hai
 His hymns are of two types — spiritual and adorned, though most compositions are adorned
 unki aadhyatmik rachanaaen vaishnav darshan par aadhaarit he
 Annamacharya belonged to the Ramanujacharya sect
 unhone ahobila math main shri satagopa yatindra se diksha grahan kii
 
 He dwells on the subjects of morality, Dharma, righteousness, etc
 in his spiritual songs
 His erotic songs worship Lord Venkateswara by describing his amorous and romantic adventures, a tradition now known as Madhura Bhakti
 Most of these songs describe the adventures of Venkateswara and Alamel Manga, while others describe the Bhakti of Krishna's devotees
 He was one of the first few who opposed the social stigma towards the untouchable castes in his era, with his sankeertanas explaining that the relationship between God and human is the same irrespective of the latters' color, caste and financial status, in beautiful yet powerful usage of words in his song "brahmam Okkate Parabrahmam Okkate 


" His choice of words gives a mellifluous tone to his songs, charming the listener
 His prodigious literary career that produced about 32,000 songs, many of which were greatly acclaimed, has earned him a place among the all-time greats of telugu literature
 His meeting with Purandara Dasa in Tirumala
 Once when Purandara Dasa visited Tirumala he heard a great old man singing his composition in front of the Almighty Srinivasa
 He at once approached the old man and said that the song was composed for practicing music
 At the same time, Sri Sri Vyasaraya of the Vyasaraya mutt intervened and introduced the great old man as Talapaka Anammacharya to Purandara Dasa
 This is one of the major event in the history of music where two great souls met each other and paid due respect to each other
 Purandara Dasa is revered as the Father of Carnatic Music who formulated the music as it is today
 The composition Sri Annamacharya sang is like Padumanabha Paramapurusha An ardent devotee of Lord Venkateswara of Tirupati, AP, Annamacharya successfully composed more than 32,000 sankeertanas in the Carnatic music tradition
 Though a great feat in itself, it still falls short of the estimated 475,000 sankeertanas composed by Purandara Dasa
 While enjoying popularity in his own days, his compositions were forgotten for over three centuries for some inexplicable reason
 They were later found engraved on copper plates, hidden for centuries inside the Sri Venkateswara temple at Tirumala
 Annamacharya considered his compositions as floral offerings to God
 In the poems, he praises Venkateswara, describes his love for him, argues and quarrels with the Lord, confesses the devotee's failures and apprehensions, and surrenders himself to Venkateshwara
 His songs are classified into the Adhyaatma and Sringaara sankeertanas genres
 Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams has been successfully endeavouring to preserve the rich heritage of his compositions
 The sustained efforts of dedicated scholars and musicians during the last thirty years have also helped revive their popularity among the Telugu people
 The sankeertanas engraved on copper plates were found in the Tirumala temple just opposite the Hundi, concealed in a very small room
 It is said only 12,000 of the 32,000 sankeertanas were found
 No leads have been available to trace the remaining sankeertanas
 Some personnel involved in deciphering the plates say that the people of those days could have melted the copper plates for personal use
 The telugu film "annamaya" was based on his story
 It was released on 13th May 1997
 It starred Nagarjuna Akkineni as Annamacharya
 The cast included ramyakrishna, Suman, Mohanbabu
 It proved to be a massive hit-probably an epoch making movie in Telugu industry
 The film was directed by ace veteran k
raghavendra Rao who is considered as one of the most influential directors of the Telugu Film Industry
 The tunes composed by M
M
 Keeravani topped the charts for a long period
 The audio of this film has had the greatest sales to date in Telugu Film industry
 This film also received many Awards including a national award
 It was produced under VMC banner
 The film undoubtably left an indelible mark in the audience
his sankirtanas are very popular amongst Carnatic singers and connoisseurs, especially in the state of Andhra Pradesh
 The programme, lakshagala Sankirthanarchana, some 160,000 people sang seven Annamayya keertanas in Hyderabad, creating a new Guinness record on May 10, 2009
