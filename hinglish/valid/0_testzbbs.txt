 Pawan also went very fast to help them
 udhar bhagwaan surya ne unhen abodh shishu samajhakar apane tej se nahin jalane diya
 When Hanuman rushed to catch the sun, Rahu wanted to eclipse the sun
 hanumanji ne surya ke upree bhaag main jab rahu kaa sparsh kiya to vah bhaybheet hokar vahaan se bhaag gaya
 He went to Indra and complained "devraj! You gave me Surya and Chandra as a means to calm my apps

 " rahu kii baat sunakar indra ghabara gayi or use saath lekar surya kii ore chal pade

 When Brahma ji resurrected him, Vayudev transmitted the agony of all beings by transmitting their motion
 phir brahmaji ne kaha ki koi bhi shastr iske ang ko haani nahin kar saktaa
 Indra said that its body will be harder than thunderbolt
 suryadev ne kaha ki ve use apane tej kaa shatansh pradaan karenge tathaa shaastra marmajna hone kaa bhi aashirwad diya
 Varun said that this child will always be safe with my loop and water
 yamadev ne avadhya or neerog rahane kaa aashirwad diya
 Gods like Yaksharaj Kubera, Vishwakarma etc

 The distance from the stars through which light comes in eight thousand years, we have measured a quarter to twenty-four padma mi

 In the field of cosmology, some important things have come up due to the discoveries of the last few years
 vikhyath vaigyanik habal ne apane nirikshanon se brahmadavidya kii ek nai prakriya kaa pataa lagaaya
 Hubble tested the light coming from the far-flung sky Ganges and explained that the vibrations of light waves increase as they reach the Earth
 yadi is prakaash kaa varnapat praapt karen to varnapat kaa jhukaav laal rang kii ore adhik hota he
 This process is called the Doppler effect
 dhwani sambandhi dopalar prabhaav se bahut log parichit honge
 When we look at the Doppler effect in the context of light, the light coming from far away has a blue tilt and the light from a distant light source has a tilt to red
 is prakaar habal ke nirikshanon se yah maaloom hua ki akaash gangaaen hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Hubble also stated that their speed of movement away from Earth is proportional to their distance from Earth
 mount polomer vedhashala main sthit 200 inch vyasavaale lens kii doorabeen se khagol shastriyon ne akaash gangaaon ke dur hatane kii prakriya ko dekha he
 When we look at the universe with a telescope, we feel that we are the center of this universe and other things are running away from us
 yadi anya akaash gangaaon main prekshak bheje jaaen to ve bhi yahi paaenge ki is brahmad ke centre bindu hai, baaki akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi hai
 The correct picture that comes to us now is that the universe is expanding at the same speed
 or is vishaal praaroop kaa koi bhi bindu anya vastuon se dur hatataa ja rahaa he
 After Hubble's research, the rendering of the principles of the universe became necessary
 yah vah samay tha jab ki ainstin kaa saapekshavaad kaa siddhant apni shaishvavastha main tha
 However, Einstein's theory was more successful than Newton's theories in interpreting findings based on solar system observations
 newton ke anusaar do pindon ke bich kii guru tvkarshan shakti ek duusare par tatkaal prabhaav daalati he lekin ainstin ne yah sabit kar diya ki parsparik guru tvkarshan kii shakti kii gati prakaash kii gati ke samaan teevr nahin ho sakati he
 After all, here Einstein misinformed Newton's letter
 logon ko ainstin kaa hi siddhant pasand aayaa
 Three concepts of the origin of the universe are presented xxrep 4 - 1
 sthir avasthaa kaa siddhant 2
 Explosion Theory and 3
 dolan siddhant
 The second assumption is more important in these assumptions
 is dharna ke anusaar brahmad kii utpatti ek mahapind ke visphot se hui he or isi kaaran akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi he
 If you put the inverted picture of this universe in front of you, then you will see the universe becoming disheveled, and the sky will appear as if the Ganges is not running
 at: kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki kisi samay koi mahapind rahaa hoga or usee ke visphot hone ke kaaran akaash gangaaen bhaagti hui hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Explosion theory is also confirmed by the discovery of new wires called quasars and pulsars

 In some cases, no further intervention is required and in some, microdelectomy or total duct stimulation may be appropriate
 yadi rogi stanpan karne kii kshamta ko sangrakshit karnaa chahta he or keval ekal-duct discharge maujuud he, to sthaniyakrut nalika nishpaadan karne ke sandarbh main dactoscopy yaa gallectography se upachaar kiya jaataa hai

 unka janm frederick ke netherland main nishkaashan ke dauraan hua tha
 After an unsuccessful marriage to her distant cousin, Charles Dwi of England, she moved to Hadelberg with her brother Karl Ludwig, Elector Phalz
 jahaan wo apni vivaah tak rahi thi
 Before marriage she was known as the Princess Falz of the Rhine, as her father was the Falz, the constituent of the Jagir of Rhineland
 30 sitambar 1658 ko unka vivaah bernasvik-lunberg ke duk, arnest augustus ke saath hua, jiske kaaran unhen dches kii upadi praapt hui
 In 1692, Augustus was made the elector of Hannover, and Sophia became the elector of Hannover
 sofia ko ek budhimaan, or vaigyanik tathaa darshanik jigyaasa se bharpoor mahila ke rup main janaa jaataa tha
 Sophia and Ernest's marriage lasted until death, and despite Ernest's anger and frequent absence, they had a lot of love
 sofia ne arnest ke anek santanon ko janm diya tha, jiname se: Sophia had, during her life, experienced much better health than she was at the time
 haalanki ve rani eni se kahin budhi thi, parantu mrityu ke samay unki sehat unase kaaphi behatar the
 On 5 June 1714, upon receiving a wrathful letter from Queen Anne, she fell ill with fear
 do dinon baad, aswasthta se ubarne ke baad, ve herrenhausen ke bageeche main tahal raheen thi, jab achaanak musaladhar barish hone lagi
 According to Buckberg's Countess, Sophia collapsed after running to avoid the rain and broke the dam
 is prafer unka dehanth 83 kii aayu main 8 june 1714 ko hui, jo us kaal ke anusaar bahut adhik or asaamaanya tha
 While Queen Anne committed murder a month later at the age of 49

 Plosius magarhinchusplosius salimali fin kii baya ek choti bunakar chidiya kii jati he jo bharat or nepal main ganga tathaa brahmaputra kii ghaatiyon main pai jaati he
 Its two subspecies are recognized - Plosius magarhynchus, which is found in Kumaon and Plosius salimally, which is found in the eastern Terai
 jab hum ko nainital ke paas kalaadhungi se is jati kaa namoona mila to unhone iskaa namakaran kiya
 This caste was rediscovered by Frank Finn in the Terai area near Kolkata and got his name
 oats ne san 1889 main ise purvi baya naam diya jabaki stuart baker ne san 1925 main ise fin kii baya naam diya
 They like to live in high grasslands like reeds, canes, canes etc

 The original habitat of these birds is in eastern Nepal and Assam although it is found in small numbers here and there in the Terai region of northern India
 uttar pradesh or usase lage pashchimi nepal main ek-do ilaakon main yah paye jate hai
 The spread of this bird has also been very narrow in its residential area and its disappearance from these narrow areas in the last few decades indicates that their numbers are declining

 This bird likes to live and eat in the herd and makes a lot of noise
 yah jhundon main hi prajnan karnaa pasand karte hai or may se sitambar main prajnan karte hai
 Its nest is different from other weaver birds found in India but like other weaver birds they also make their nest with grass and leaves fibers
 yah jati apane puure ghonsle main andar se parat chadhaata he
 Other weaver birds lining the floor only from within
 inke ghonsle golakaar hote hai or aasaani se dikh jate hai kyonki nar ghonsle ke aas-paas kii pattiyon kaa istemaal ghonslaa banane ke liye kar lete hai

 Two Indian academics Humayun Kabir and Jogendra Singh formed a committee in 1946 with the help of the then West Bengal Chief Minister Bidhan Chandra Roy to set up post-war industrial development institutes of higher technical institutions in India
 iske baad nalini ranjan sarkaar ki aguwai main 22-sadasyeey ek kamity kaa gathan hua
 In its interim report, the committee proposed the establishment of higher-tech institutions in different parts of the country on the lines of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with associated second-tier institutions
 report main desh ke chaar bhaagon main pramukh sansthaanon ki jald sthapana ke liye kaary aarambh karne par jor diya gaya, saath hi yah bhi kaha gaya ki purv or pashchim main sansthaanon kii sthapana atisheeghra honi chahie
 At that time, Bidhan Chandra Roy persuaded the Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru to establish that the first institution should be established in West Bengal
 is prakaar pehle bhartiya praudyogiki santhaan ki sthapana may 1950 main "eastern Higher Technical Institute" ke naam se hui
 The institute was initially located in the Eastern Esplanade in Kolkata and was displaced from its permanent campus in Hijli, Kharagpur, 120 km southeast of Kolkata in September 1950
 jab agast 1951 main pehla satr armbh hua, tab santhaan main 224 chaatr or 10 vibhaagon main 42 shikshak the
 All classrooms, laboratories and administrative offices were located in the historic Hijli imprisonment camp where political revolutionaries were held captive and sentenced to death during the British rule

 The name of "indian Institute of Technology" was assumed on 18 August 1951 by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad before its formal inauguration
 15 sitambar 1956 ko bhartiya sansad ne "bhartiya praudyogiki santhaan adhinium" paarit kar diya jiske tahat santhaan ko "rashtriya mahatv ke santhaan" kaa darja mila
 In 1956, Prime Minister Nehru said in the first convocation address of the institute: shahid bhawan ko 1990 main ek sangrahalay ke rup main parivartit kar diya gaya
 The Srinivasa Ramanujan campus was incorporated as a new academic campus where Taxila started functioning in 2002 and Vikramashila in 2003

 Many Commonwealth countries also require similar qualifications, such as FRCSC in Canada, FRACS in Australia and New Zealand and FCS in South Africa

 It is also an ancient practice, which continues till today, although it has no real foundation

 avakal jyamiti ganit kii ek vidha he jo calculas tathaa rekhiy tathaa bahurekhiy bijganit kaa upyog karke jyamitiya samasyaon kaa adhyayan karti he
 In this, the properties of the planes and multiples are studied which are located near one of their minorities such as the study of the properties of a curve or plane, in the neighborhood of a point
 maapiya avakal jyamiti kaa sambandh un gunon se he jinamein naapane kii kriya nihit ho
 In classical differential geometry, such curves and planes are studied that lie in the three-dimensional Euclidean recess
 isamen avakal kalan or samakalan kii vidhiyon kaa prayog hota he; yaa yo kahie ki is vidya main ham vakron or talon ke un gunon kaa adhyayan karte hai, jo trivistari gatiyon main bhi nishchal rahete hai
 In deflective differential geometry, we study the properties of a geometric shape near a common minority, in which there is no disorder with any universal deflection transform
 jaise kisi vakr ke ye gun ki uske kisi bindu par sparsh rekha athwa aashleshan samtal kaa astitv he athwa nahin, viksheptmak avakaleey gun hai kintu kisi tal kaa yah gun ki usapar alpaantari kaa astitv he yaa nahin, viksheptmak nahin he, kyonki isamen lambaai kaa bhav nihit he jo viksheptmak nahin he
 There have been at least three methods of studying the deflective differential properties of shapes, which are as follows: avakal sameekaran, Deficit range and kisi bindu ke vikshep nirdeshaankon kaa ek prachal athwa avakal roopon ke padon main prasar
 Display calculus can be used in the first and third methods
 upyukt nirdesh tribhuj chunane se, jiske chunaav kaa dhang adwitiya hoga, kisi samtal vakr kaa sameekaran is rup main dhaala ja saktaa he: All coefficients in this power series are absolute determinants of the curve, under the universal deflection transform, so they express all the deflective differential properties of the curve at the pivot
 kisi vakr ke kisi bindu par ke sparshi kaa bhav suparichit he
 Suppose we take four other points near the point Pa of a curve
 jab ye chaaron bindu paa kii ore agrasar hote hai, tab in paanchon binduon dwaara khinche gaye shankav kii jo seemaasthiti hogi, use vakr ke bindu paa par, aashleshan shankav kehete hai
 Similarly, with the help of the property of a plane trigratic that it is determined by nine voluntary points, we can give the definition of the trajectory trident
 is adhyayan main, seemaa ke prayog ke kaaran, kalan bahut kaam main aata he
 Ordinarily, there are two monocular families of asymptotic curves in a triangular deflective recess
 yadi do se kam parivaar hon to tal vikasya hoga
 If there are more than two, the floor will be a plane
 yadi vikasya talon ore samatalon ko chhod diya jaae or ananthasparshi rekhaon ko tal ke prachaliy vakr maan liya jaae to samghaat nirdeshaank is prakaar chune ja sakate hai ki ve avakal samikarnon kii nimnlikhit sanhati ko santusht karen : These are called Fybin's differential equations
 gunakan u, uu pa pha tal ke nishchal hai
 One of the deflective properties of a plane is its tangent to another plane
 visheshkar, dwighat talon kaa ek triprachal parivaar hota he jiskaa tal pri se kisi bindu mu par dwitiya kram kaa sparsh hota he
 If the quadratic is chosen such that the tangent to the intersection curve on the moo is pendulous to the asymptotes of the moo, the quadratic Darbo quadratic 3-point tangents are called Darbo tangent
 pri ke prayek bindu par darbo dwighatiyon kaa ek ekprachal parivaar hota he
 Of this, there are very special types of quadrats
 kadachit lee dwighati sabase rochak hote hai
 They can be described as follows: Draw the tangent of the asymptotic curve at the three points taking Pa and Pa 2, two adjacent points on the asymptotic curve of Moo
 ye teen sparshi ek dwighati kaa nirdhaaran karte hai
 When Pa and Pa 2 move towards the curve along the curve, then the boundary of the said quadratic is called Li quadratic
 rekhaon ke kisi dwiprachal parivaar ko sarvangasamata kehete hai
 For example, the scale of a plane is a congruent congruence
 yadi pri ke kisi bindu mu kaa saahchary ek rekha se he jisaki sthiti mu ke saath saath badalati rahati he to aisi rekhaon ke sangrah se ek sarvangasamata kaa nirmaan hota he
 When the ground plane moves on an appropriate curve of the surface, the companion line of congruency touches the curve and thus creates a developmental plane
 saadhaarant: kisi tal par aise vakron ke do ekprachal parivaar hote hai
 Their association with the developmental levels of congruency
 ab maan lijie ki ek sarvangasamata kaa nirmaan tal pri ke binduon ke madhya se janevaali aisi rekhaon se hota he jo un binduon par khinche gaye pri ke sparshatalon par sthit nahin hai, to kisi bhi darbo dwighati ke prati in rekhaon kii vyutkram dhruviyaan ek sarvagasamata kaa nirmaan karti hai jisaki rekhaayen pri ke sparshasmatalon par sthit hoti hai, kintu unke sparshabinduo main se hokar nahin jaatin
 Such pairs of congruent congruences are called inverse congruent congruences
 aaj tak vyutkram sarvangasmtaon ke bahut se jodon kaa adhyayan ho chukaa he
 One of these pairs is Wilzyski's fixed congruence
 inaki paribhaasha is prakaar di ja sakati he: yadi t kii vyutkram sarvangasmtaon kii ek jodi ke vikasyon ke sangat vakron ke do kulak abhinn ho jaaen to ukt sarvangasmtaon ko vinljiski kii niyat sarvangasmtayein kehete hai
 In order to know what is the significance of the convexities in the deflection geometry, it is necessary to understand the imagery of conjugate webs
 inaki paribhaasha ham is prakaar de sakate hai: Suppose asymptomatic curves are drawn from the middle of a point on a plane, then the tangent of this point and its harmonic conjugate to the tangents drawn at that point on the said curves, these two together are called conjugate tangents
 yadi sanyugmi spershiyon ke kisi jode main se ek ko kisi ekprachal vacrapariwaar ke ek vakr kaa sparshi maan liya jaae to jode kaa doosraa sparshi ek anya ekprachal vacrapariwaar kaa sparshi ho jayega
 The conjugate mesh is formed from two such curves of curves
 sanyugmi jaalon kaa ek anya lakshanik gun in shabdon main vayakt ho saktaa he: jab koi bindu mu sanyugmi jaal ke ek vakr par chalata he tab jaal ke duusare vakr par bindu mu par khinche gaye sparshi ek vikasya tal kaa srijan karte hai
 When a point moves on a curve of the plane, its measurement potential creates a curved surface
 yadi vakr ke sthaan main vakratarekha len to yah rujurekhaj tal vikasya ho jaataa he
 a mesh formed by curved lines is a conjugate mesh and corresponds to the measurement of congruent congruency
 ham isi baat ko is prakaar vyakt karte hai ki mapatmak abhilamb sarvangasamata tal se sanyugmi he
 In the deflective differential geometry there are many congruent congruences that can be called universal reciprocal congruences, because the convexity is determined by the surface and is conjugated to the plane
 inhen main se ek yathakthith green-faubini vikshep abhilamb bhi he
 The curve whose tangents form a developmental plane is called the marked core of the plane
 mu ke sanyugmi spershiyon ke lakshanik gun se yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki jode me se prayek sparshi rashmibindu par nishit kor kaa sparshi hota he
 Thus the two Rashmibindu points determine a Rashmi of the Moo trap
 jaal ke vakron ke bindu mu par ke aashleshan samatalon kii pratichchhed rekha jaal kaa aksh hoti he
 Many individuals have studied Rashmi and Aksha and the surrogates generated by them
 kuch logon ne alpantariyon kii kalpana kaa, yah dekhakar ki inkaa mapatmak avakal jyamiti main kitna mahatv he, vikshep jyamiti main prayog karne kaa praytn kiya he
 First of all, the brahmas of the Nischal Anukal are called deflection Alpantari
 samast vikshep alpantariyon ke aashleshan samtal kaksha 3 kaa ek shanku banaate hai
 The marked axis of the said cone is the deflection normal of Green and Fubini
 alpikaon kaa ek anya sarvikaran sarvagasamata ke sanyog vakr main miltaa hai
 The above curve is a curve of the plane surface, whose point of incidence of each point goes from the center of the line of congruence to that point
 kisi likhit soochna yaa dastavej ko kisi vishesh kram main vyavasthit karne ko samaanukraman kehete hai
 for example, samaanukraman kii kai vidhiyaan hai
 Symbolization of data in languages based on Latin script is based on alphabet order but only alphabet is not sufficient to do the encoding in Devanagari and other Indian languages
 inamen 'vyanjan+maatra' ko ek ikai maanakar do shabdon yaa vaakyanshon kii tulana kii jaati he
 Now-a-days computers are used for synchronization
 samaanukraman ke liye bhashaa evam lipi ke anusaar alag-alag kram va vidhiyaan hai
 The languages based on the Latin script have a hierarchy of alphabets, while languages with scripts based on the Brahmi script have a more complex hierarchy
 chini bhashaa ke liye samaanukraman ke liye bhi alag vidhi he

 mahabharat main varnit kiratveshi shiv ke saath arjuna ke yuddh kii laghu katha ko aadhaar banaakar kavi ne raajnneeti, dharmaniti, kootneeti, samaajanneeti, yudhniti, janajivan aadi kaa manoram varnan kiya he
 This poem is filled with various juices, but it is predominantly a heroic work
 sanskrit ke chha: prasiddh mahakavy hai – brihattrayee or laghutrayee
 Kiratarajanayiyam, Shishupalavadham and Nashidhacharitam - are called Brihattrayi
 kumarasambhavam, raghuvansham or meghdutam - laghutrayee kehalaate hai
 Kiratarajuniyam is the only available work of Bharvi, which paved the way for a Sangopang epic
 magh-jaise kaviyon ne usee kaa anugaman karte hue sanskrit sahitya bhandar ko is vidha se samrudh kiya or ise nai oonchaai pradaan kii
 The stream of the epic, which appears in Kalidasa's miniatures and Ashwaghosh's Buddhacharitam, notwithstanding its distinct qualities, does not have the poise and totality that Bharvi initiated
 sanskrit main kiratarjunium kii kam se kam 37 tikaayen hui hai, jinamein mallinath kii tikaa ghantapath sarvshereshth he
 In 1912 Karl Kappler translated German into Kirtarajuniyam under the Harvard Oriental Series
 angreji main bhi iske bhinn-bhinn bhaagon ke chha: se adhik anuwaad ho chuke hai
 Due to Bharvi's special tendency in politics and behavior-policy, it was only reasonable that he would pick up the story of Kiratarajuniyam from the Mahabharata
 unhone vanaparv ke paanch adhyyon se pandavon ke vanvaas ke samay amogh astr ke liye arjuna dwaara kii gai shiv kii ghor tapasya ke falswaroop pashupathastra praapt karne ke chote-se prasang ko uthaakar use atharah sargon ke is mahakavy kaa rup de diya
 When Yudhishthira lost everything in the Dutekrida with the Kauravas, he had to go on a 13-year exile with his brothers and Draupadi
 unka adhikansh samay dwaitvan main beetaa
 Draupadi used to inspire Yudhishthira often to prepare for war and to withdraw his kingship from the Kauravas through war, dismayed by the hardships of exile and remembering the plot by the Kauravas
 bhim bhi draupadi kii baton kaa paksh lete hai
 a forester sent to Hastinapur as an undercover informs that Duryodhana is involved in the all-round development and consolidation of his united kingdom, as he feared the Pandavas for half the kingdom he had dealt with fraud and gaming
 pandavon ko bhi lagata he ki vanvaas kii avadhi samaapt hone par unka aadha rajya bina yuddh ke waapas nahin milegaa
 Draupadi and Bhima provoke Yudhishthira to immediately attack Duryodhana, not waiting for the period of exile to end, but unwilling to take the limits of idealistic, unforgiving Yudhishthira behavior
 udhar aa nikle vyas salaah dete hai ki bhavishya ke yuddh ke liye pandavon ko abhi se shakti-sanvardhan karnaa chahie
 According to the remedy given by him, Arjuna walks towards the Indrakil mountain in the Himalayas under the guidance of a Yaksha to appease Indra for asceticism
 vahaan ek ashram banaakar kii gai tapasya ke falswaroop apsaraon aadi ko bhejkar pariksha lene ke baad indra ek vruddh muni ke vesh main upasthit hote hai or tapasya ke nashwan loukik lakshya ko nidhsaar bataate hue parmarth kii mahatta kaa nidarshan karte hai
 Arjuna satisfies Indra by presenting the account of the deceit and injustice done by the Kauravas in its cut, the imperative of retaliation from the enemy, social duty and retaliation for injustice
 falswaroop indra apane vaastavik rup main prakat hokar arjuna ko manorath-purti ke liye shiv kii tapasya karne kii salaah dete hai
 Arjuna again engages in severe, uninterrupted penance
 arjuna indrakil ke liye ek ajanabi tapasvi he, jataa, valkal or mrigcharm to uske paas hai lekin saath hi sharir main kavach bhi he, yagyopavit kii jagah pratyancha-samet gandiv dhanush he, do vishaal tarkas hai or ek uttam khadg bhi
 Considering it to be anti-sageism, the other ascetics there are terrorized and reach Shankar for request
 uske kram main shiv ji kiraaton kii sthaneey janajati ke senapati kaa vesh dharankar kiraatveshdhari apane ganon kii sena lekar arjuna ke paas pahunch jate hai
 That is why a demon named 'mook' considers Arjuna's penance to be the work of the gods, holding the body of a giant sucker, and then hurries to kill him
 shiv or arjuna donon dwaara ek saath chalaae gaye ek-jaise baan se us boar kii igalila samaapt ho jaati he
 Shiva's arrow gets pierced into the earth piercing his body and when Arjun goes to remove his arrow from his body, Shiva sends one of his Ganes to raise a dispute
 parinamtah donon ke bich yuddh armbh ho jaataa he
 Arjuna forces the army of the Ganas to run away with arrows but is defeated in the war with Shiva
 paraajay se hataash arjuna kiraat-senapati ke vesh main shiv ko pahachaanakar samarpan kar dete hai, jisase prasann hokar shiv prakat hote hai or pashupathastra pradaankar uskaa prashikshan dete hai
 In this way, with the completion of Arjuna's intention, all the intentions of the epic genre are proved
 kiraat veshdhari shiv ke is lokottar myth se itar is prasang kii apni ek vishisht janajaatiy abhivyanjana bhi he, jo is kavy ko vartmaan bhavabodh ke kareeb laati he
 The unwavering loyalty, indomitable boldness and high political understanding of Vancher in the dialogue between Yudhishthira and gupta-turned-vancher leaves no room for doubt in India's favor towards the forest dwellers
 vanechar shuru main hi spasht kar detaa he— In the beginning of this whole episode, some proverbs have been uttered by Bhima towards Yudhishthira in support of Draupadi's talk
 unheen main se ek neeche uddhrit he: Bharavi is known for his sense of pride - 'upma Kalidasasya Bhaverirthagaurvam'
 is arth-gaurav se mail khaati ek vidagdh bhashaa or abhivyakti-kaushal unki smapda he
 He has an extraordinary penetration in diverse dimensions of life, including politics and behavior
 adarsh or vyavhaar ke dwandv tathaa yatharth jivan ke atirekon ke samaahaar se arjeet santulan unke lekhan ko ‘samastalokaranjak’ banaata he
 But Bharvi is basically a poet of life's irony and discrepancies, confronting him and trying to reconcile between his rough reality
 kiratarjunium ke pehle sarg main draupadi or duusare main bhim dwaara yudhisthir ko duryodhana ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke liye uksaane or yudhisthir dwaara use anithipurna bataakar asweekaar kar dene ke kram main bharavi ne raajnneeti ke do chhoron ke bich ke dwandv par bahut sarthak vimarsh prastut kiya he
 Similarly, in the eleventh canto in the place of salvation, Indra's asceticism for power and sovereignty has been described as indescribable by Indra, as a response to Arjuna, Bharavi retaliated against injustice in life-practice, cosmic success, fame and self
 - The serious views given on the importance of respect, they present a picture of a balanced ideal of a healthy academic life
 bhashaa par apane apratim adhikaar ke chalate chitrakavy ke jis bhashik chamatkaar kii parampara bharavi ne shuru kii, unke baad ke kaviyon ke liye vah kasuti ban gai or magh main jaakar vah charmotkarsh par pahaunchi

 There are 18 cantos in Kiratarjuniyam
 kiratarjunium ke pehle sarg main draupadi or duusare main bhim dwaara yudhisthir ko duryodhana ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke liye uksaane or yudhisthir dwaara use anithipurna bataakar asweekaar kar dene ke kram main bharavi ne raajnneeti ke do chhoron ke bich ke dwandv par bahut sarthak vimarsh prastut kiya he
 In the third canto, Vyasa advises Bhishma, Drona, Karna-like men of the Kaurava side to invoke power in every way over a period of 13 years, describing them as invincible by the Pandavas, and to use them for preparing for a future war
 iske liye ve arjuna ko ucch koti ke shastrastra hetu tapasya se indra ko prasann karne ke liye prerit karte hai or apane saath laae ek yaksha ko bhi chhod jate hai jo arjuna ko indra kii tapasya ke liye upyukt sthaan tak le jayega
 In the fourth canto, there is a lively and interesting account of Arjuna's journey from Dvaitavan to the Himalayas under the guidance of the Yaksha, in which the euphoria and moderate nature of the autumn and the joy of the mixed life of the people is waved in many forms
 paanchavaan sarg yaksha ke saath arjuna ke yatra-prasang se giriraaj himalay ke parvatiy pradesh ke vishad, alankaarik varnan kii chata se deept he
 The theme of the sixth canto is: Indranil's unmatched beauty seen through Arjuna's eyes, Arjuna's initiation of penance, the various nature's contribution to asceticism, the deities stationed there, informing Indra by reaching Amaravati by Indra, Indra gives the Devangas their Go there with fellow Gandharvas and order to disturb Arjuna's penance with his gesture and beauty, so that his destruction Integrity can be tested
 saatven sarg main apsaraayen tathaa unke sahchar gandharv puure ullas-vilaas ke saath akaash maarg se vishesh prakaar ke haathiyon or rathon par savaar dev ganga ke kinare-kinare amravati se indrakil tak kii yatra karte hai
 After getting down near Indrakil, they make a divine camp like gandharva-nagari from their illusion on the majestic river Ganges
 aathvaan sarg main apsaraayen apane shiviron se van-vihaar ke liye nikalati hai
 From here, the color of Shringar Rasa begins to rise, which is thickened in the water sports described in this canto and reaches its culmination in the ninth canto, which is full of wine and drink
 dasavaan sarg apsaraon dwaara arjuna kaa dhyaan khinchakar use tapasya se chyut karne ke abhiyaan or uski asafalataa kaa he
 The eleventh canto depicts the arrival of Indra in the guise of the Veteran Muni and the futility of his worldly goal of penance, in response to which Arjuna makes his narrative of the values, priorities of cosmic life
 is sarg ke ant main arjuna ke tark se santusht devraj apane swaroop main prakat hokar uske lakshya ke anuroop shiv kii aradhana kaa upadesh dete hai
 In the twelfth canto, Arjuna starts austere penance, so that other saints get scared and go to Shankar
 shankar kiraat kaa vesh dharkar arjuna se milte hai
 In the thirteenth canto, both Arjuna and Kirat Rupadhari Shiva attack Sukar Rupdhari with arrows
 kiratarjunium ke antim paanch sarg apni gana-sena ke saath kiraatveshdhari shiv or arjuna ke bich yuddh ko samarpit hai
 In the 15th canto, in which this phase of the war comes, Bharvi has used Chitrakavya to introduce a new tradition within the realm of the epic
 kiratarjunium samalochakon ko atipriy he
 It has more than 42 commentaries

 ve germany ke statagart nagar main 22 agast 1907 main hui saatvin antarrashtriya congress main bharat kaa pratham tirangaa rashtradhvaj fahraane ke liye suvikhyath hai
 At that time the tricolor was not as it is today
 unke dwaara paris se prakashit "vandemaataram" patr pravasi bharatiyon main kaaphi lokapriy hua
 At the International Socialist Congress held in Stuttgart, Germany in 1907, Madame Bhikaji Cama said that - "continuation of British rule in India is a stigma in the name of humanity
" ek mahaan desh bharat ke hiton ko isse baari kshati pahunch rahi he
 "he appealed to the people to cooperate in liberating India from slavery and called upon the Indians that -" Go ahead, we are Hindustani and Hindustan belongs to Hindustan
 " ’’ yahi nahin madam bhikaaji kama ne is conference main ‘vandemaataram’ ankit bharat kaa pratham tirangaa rashtradhvaj fahraa kar angrejon ko kadi chunauti di
 Madam Bhikaji was also the private secretary of Dada Bhai Naoroji in Cama London
 dhani parivaar main janm lene ke baavjood is saahsee mahila ne adarsh or drudh sankalp ke bal par niraapad tathaa sukhi jivanavaale vaataavaran ko tilanjali de di or shakti ke charmotkarsh par pahunche samrajya ke viruddh krantikari kaaryon se upje khataron tathaa kathinaaiyon kaa saamana kiya
 Mrs
 Cama's great contribution was to raise the world public opinion against imperialism and to present India's desire for freedom from foreign rule
 bharat kii swadhinata ke liye ladate hue unhone lambii avadhi tak nirvasit jivan bitaayaa tha
 According to the facts, although Bhikaji believed in non-violence, he also called for opposition to unjust violence
 unhone swaraj ke liye aawaaj uthaai or naaraa diya− aage badho, ham bharat ke liye hai or bharat bharatiyon ke liye he
 Bhikaji Cama was born on 24 September 1861 in Bombay to a Parsi family
 unamem logon kii madad or seva karne kii bhaavana kuta−kuta kar bhari thi
 Bhikaji served its patients after the plague spread in Mumbai in 1896

 She was recovered after treatment but was advised to go to Europe for rest and further treatment
 varsh 1902 main vah isi silsile main landan gayi or vahaan bhi unhone bhartiya swadhinata sangharsh ke liye kaam jari rakhaa
 In 1907, Bhikaji, with the help of his colleague Sardarsingh Rana, designed the first design of India's first tricolor national flag
 bhikaaji kama ne 22 agast 1907 ko germany main hui international socialist conference main bhartiya swatantraaa ke dhwajbharat kaa pratham tirangaa rashtradhvaj ko buland kiya tha
 At that conference, he appealed to free India from British rule
 unke taiyaar kiye gaye jhande se kaaphi milte−julate digaayan ko baad main bharat ke dhvaj ke rup main apanaaya gaya
 This India's first tricolor national flag, built by Ranaji and Kamaji, is still kept safe in the house of BJP leader Rajubhai Rana, grandson of Sardarsingh Rana in Bhavnagar, Gujarat
 vah apane krantikari vichaar apane samachar-patr ‘vandemaataram’ tathaa ‘talwaar’ main prakat karti thim
 Mrs
 Cama's fight was against imperialism around the world
 vah bharat ke swadhinata andolan ke mahatva ko khub samajhati thim, jiskaa lakshya sampurna prithvi se samrajyavad ke prabhutv ko samaapt karnaa tha
 His colleagues considered him the 'mother of the Indian revolution'; Whereas the British called her a notorious woman, dangerous revolutionary, anarchist revolutionary, anti-british and inconsistent
 europe ke samaajawaadee samudaay main shrimati kama kaa paryaapt prabhaav tha
 This was evident when he invited European journalists to defend their patriots
 vah ‘bhartiya rashtriyata kii mahaan pujaarin’ ke naam se vikhyath thim
 His portrait appeared in French newspapers with Joan of Arc
 yah is tathy kii bhavpurn abhivyakti thi ki shrimati kama kaa europe ke rashtriya tathaa loktantric samaaj main vishisht sthaan tha
 In the flag waving by Bhikaji, there was an attempt to assimilate the feelings and culture of different religions of the country
 usamen islam, hindutv or buddha mat ko pradarshit karne ke liye haraa, pilaa or laal rang istemaal kiya gaya tha
 Also, in the middle of it was written Vande Mataram in Devanagari script

 It was composed by Abul Fazal, a Navratan courtier of Akbar
 isamen akbar ke darbar, uske prashasan ke bare main charchaa kii gai he
 It has three sections, the last section of which is named Akbarnama
 ye khand swayan teen prakhandon main he
 ain-i-akbari is the third and more famous part of the great history book Akbarnama, published in the Persian language by abulafjl-e-allami
 yah ek brihat, pruthak tathaa swatantra pustak he
 With the inspiration, encouragement and command of Emperor Akbar, this book was composed five times as a result of extraordinary hard work
 yadhyapi abulafajl ne anya pustaken bhi likhi hai, kintu use sthaayee or vishwavyaapee kirti in-e-akabari ke aadhaar par hi uplabdh ho saki
 According to the narration of Abulafzl himself, his aim was to preserve the memory of the great emperor and guide the curious
 mughal kaal ke islamic jagat main iskaa yathesht aadar hua; kintu paashchaatya viddhanon ko or unke dwaara bharatiyon ko, is amuly nidhi kii chetana tab hui jab sarvapratham warren hestings ke kaal main gladwin ne iskaa aanshik anuwaad kiya; tatpashchaat blocoman or jaret ne iskaa sampurna anuwaad kiya
 The book is divided into five parts and was completed in seven years
 pratham bhaag main samrat kii prashasti tathaa mahali or darbari vivaran he
 In the second part, the state staff, military and civil posts, rules related to matrimonial and education, miscellaneous divergence and dependent of the court are prominent litterateurs and musicians
 tisare bhaag main nyaay tathaa prabandhak vibhaagon ke kanoon, krishishasan sambandhi vivaran tathaa baarah suubon kii gyatavya suchnaayen or aankade sankalit hai
 The fourth section describes the social condition of Hindus and their religion, philosophy, literature and science, foreign invaders and prominent travelers, and famous Muslim saints, and the fifth part compiles Akbar's submissions and author's epilogue
 ant main lekhak ne swayan apana zikr kiya he
 In this way there is a very subtle reference of the emperor, imperial rule and the governed class in ain-i-akbari
 isaki pramukh visheshta yah he ki yudhon, shadyantron tathaa vanshaparivartanon ke pachadon ko praadhanya dene kii apeksha shasit varg ko samuchit sthaan pradaan kiya gaya he
 In a way, it is the first gazetteer of modern India
 isaki sarvaadhik mahatta yah he ki kattarta or dharmonmad ke virodh main hindu samaaj, dharm or darshan ko vishad gungrahi sthaan dekar pragatisheel or udaatt drushtikon kii sthapana kii gai he
 Abulfazl was also possible in other scholarly periods, but a text like iin-e-akbari was possible only in the period of Akbar, as the extraordinary coordination and extraordinary emperor's complete co-ordination was made possible by the inspiration of lofty feelings at the intellectual level
 in-e-akabari par samrat kii prashasti main mukhyat: atishyokti kaa dosha lagaaya jaataa he, kintu blocoman ke kathananusaar "


 vah prashansa karata he, kyonki use ek sachcha nayak mil gaya he
 "and it is undisputed that ain-e-akbari holds the importance of a dictionary for the study of political, economic and social history

 Diplomatic recognition is a political act, by which one nation recognizes, of another state, or of any action of its government, or of the condition by which the truth or truth is proved, and its intention is revealed, that recognition On the domestic and international legal conclusions of
 manyata vaastavik yaa vidhitah, saamanytah manyata dene vaali sarkaar ke ek kathan dwaara di ja sakati he
 Giving recognition to a state refers to the act by which a state recognizes that the political existence of the state that has given its recognition has the qualities of kingship
 isame antarrashtriya parivaar kaa koi vartmaan sadsy kisi rajya athwa kisi raajnneetik dal ko vidhiwat apni sweekruti pradaan karata he
 This means that by the opinion of the state granting the recognition, the said state is the general officer of international rights and duties and has the ability to bear the obligations received in accordance with international legislation
 rajya manyata ke do pariklp yaa siddhant hai-1
 sanghatana-nirbhar pariklp or 2
 ghoshnaatmak athwa ghoshnaatmak pariklp
 According to the Sanghatana-dependent hypothesis, any state becomes an international state only through recognition
 arthath keval manyata ke kaary dwaara hi kisi rajya ko rajyatv mil jaataa he or vahaan kii nai sarkaar ko antarrashtriya kshetra main adhikaar praapt ho jaataa he
 Hegel was the first lecturer of this concept
 tadnantar holland, openhim tathaa anya logon ne uskaa samarthan kiya
 According to the second hypothesis, any state, without its authority, attains international office and membership of the family
 rajyamanyata kaa kaary is sthapit satya kii pushti kii vidhiwat manyatamaatr he
 Hall, Fisher, Brearley and others are lecturers of this concept
 in donon maton main se uchit mat yah prathit hota he ki rajyamanyata sanghatana-nirbhar bhi he or ghoshnaatmak bhi
 According to different fact groups, the first hypothesis may apply to someone, the second to another
 kisi raajnneetik samudaay kaa astitv he, is saamaanya tathy kii ghoshnaa maatr karnaa hi rajyamanyata he
 Due to such a declaration of statehood, certain statutory conditions arise due to recognition
 lenterpash or stark jaise aaj ke adhikansh lekhak is mat kaa pratipaadan karte hai
 Whether or not to grant recognition depends on the will of the states
 par yah ichha manamaani nahin honi chahie
 According to legal principles, statehood should be granted or not
 haan, yah avashya he ki raajnneetik or kootnithik vichaarsarani rajyamanyata kii sweekruti yaa asweekruti par apana prabhaav daalati hi he
 Validation can be of two types - either explicit or implied
 spasht manyata us samay hoti he jab manyata kaa vichaar prakat karne ke liye vidhiwat koi vijyapti nikaali jaati he yaa ghoshnaa kii jaati he
 For example, writing a letter to that state or to a government that has prayed for recognition
 sanketit manyata vah he jahaan spasht rup se to manyata prakat nahin kii jaati, parantu apane kaaryon se yah baat prakat kar di jaati he ki manyata kii sweekruti asandigdh he; jaise, do rajyon ke bich vyapaarik sandhi ho janaa athwa donon rajyon ke bich vidhiwat duutavasiya sambandh sthapit kar lenaa
 Legal recognition means that according to the state of recognition, the state or government to which it is accredited duly fulfills the requirements laid down in international legislation for active participation in the international community
 vaastavik manyata kaa arth yah he ki manyata denevaale rajya ke matanusaar jis rajya ko athwa jis sarkaar ko manyata pradaan kii gai he, vah asthaayee rup se alp kaal ke liye un aavashyaktaaon kii vastut: purti karata he, yadhyapi sari aavashyaktaayen upasthit nahin he or ukt rajya abhi paryaapt dridhtaa praapt nahin kar sakaa he
 Actual recognition is short-lived and can be returned at a time when those requirements, which must be fulfilled for validation, are not met even in bad
 vidhik manyata antim evam sthaayee hoti he or ek baar de dene ke baad vah lautaai nahin ja sakati
 In many cases it has been accepted that as far as its legal consequences are concerned, there is no difference between actual recognition and legal recognition
 jab antarrashtriya vishistatv praapt kisi rajya ke adhyaksh pad main saamaanya or vaidhanik paddati se parivartan hota he, to anya rajyon ko isaki soochna de di jaati he
 Those states give their recognition to the new president of the said state by sending a message of congratulations on their behalf
 isamen kathinaayee tabhi hoti he jab kranti ke dwaara adhyaksh ke pad main athwa sarkaar main parivartan hota he
 In such cases, two types of tests are used: The first test is whether the new government is the real government, it is the real government, which has effective control over the state and whether it is dominating the substantial area of that state
 And it has no effective opposing side
 yah bahya vishyak pareekshan kehalaata he
 The second test is whether the new government is able to fulfill the obligations which are prescribed by international legislation and by the authority of the League of Nations? This is called internal or thematic testing
 jin rajyon se nae rajya athwa sarkaar ko manyata pradaan karne ke liye kaha jaataa he, ve aise maamalon main vahiin apana nirnay sthagit rakhte hai jahaan sarkaar sthaayee nahin hoti athwa jahaan praaia: hi krantiyaan hoti rahati hai jinke kaaran sarkaar badalati rahati hai
 But the recognition of the state itself has no relation with the recognition or not of any government
 rajya ko to antarrashtriya ikai ke rup main manyata praapt hi rahati he
 According to the custom prevailing in many countries, the recognition given to the states has a retrospective effect and the courts validly accept all the actions of a new state or a new government which have been done by the new government since its inception
 manyata ke parinaam - kisi nae rajya athwa nai sarkaar ko manyata milane se nimnlikhit mukhya parinaam hote hai : After obtaining recognition - The said state or the government gets the ability to enter into a treaty or establish diplomatic relations with the states that provide the recognition
 manyataprapt ukt rajya ko yah adhikaar praapt ho jaataa he ki yah manyata denevaale rajyon ke nyaayalayon main mukadmaa daayar kar sake
 The jurisdiction of the courts of the states granting recognition to the recognized state is granted immunity or exemption in respect of itself and in relation to its property
 manyataprapt rajya ko yah adhikaar bhi praapt ho jaataa he ki manyata denevaale kisi rajya ke seemakshetra main yadi uski purvavarti sarkaar kii koi sampatti rahi ho to vah uski maang kar use adhigruhit kar sake
 If civil war breaks out in a country, rebels can be declared warring if certain conditions are met, such as- vyapak shatrukaarya ke saath grihayuddh
 To establish the suzerainty over the territory of the national frontier by the seditious and to maintain orderly governance over it
 rajyadrohiyon dwaara kisi uttaradaayi satta ke adheen yuddh ke niyamon kaa paalan karnaa
 For other-third-states, the practical need to explain their stand in relation to civil war arises
 yadi aisi sthiti ho ki inamen se keval thodi si hi sharten puri hoti hon to anya rajya vidrohiyon ko rajyadrohi kii manyata pradaan kar sakate hai or unhen kanoon-bhang-karta na maanakar us kshetra kaa vaastavik adhikari maan sakate hai jahaan unka adhikaar sthapit ho gaya ho
 Thus, if a state recognizes a state, it cannot withdraw its recognition for any political purpose
 parantu kuch vishesh paristhitiyon main manyata waapas lee ja sakati he
 For example, if a state loses its independence, or its government becomes ineffective, or if a militant party is defeated in a civil war, the state's recognition can be withdrawn
