 Over-praise is an exaggerated claim commonly found in advertising and publicity announcements, such as "highest quality at the lowest price," or "always votes in the best interests of all people
" " aise bayaan sach nahin hote hai - lekin inhen galat sabit nahin kiya ja saktaa he or isliye ve vyapaar kanoonon kaa ulanghan nahin karte hai, khaskar isliye kyonki upabhokta se yah ummid kii jaati he ki ve yah bataane main sakasham hon ki yah purna satya nahin he
 When the secret of a white lie is revealed, it produces relatively small discord and usually provides some benefit to the listener

 As a concept, it is largely defined by local practice and by any right it cannot be clearly distinguished from other lies
 ek safed jhooth ko sateek rup se paribhaashit nahin kiya ja saktaa he kyonki ek safed jhooth kin chizon se bana hota he is vishay main sabhi kii alag-alag raay ho sakati he

 Augustine of Hippo wrote two books on the subject of lying: On lying and against lying
 In his later work Retractions he describes every book he has written
 ritractions main di mendasio ke sthaan ke aadhaar par, yah prathit hota he ki ise 395 i
 main likhaa gaya he
 His first book, On Laing, begins with: "magna quæstio est de Mendacio"
 From his writings, it can be concluded that St
 Augustine divided the lie into eight categories, based on severity from above
 The following are listed in order: agastin kaa maananaa tha ki "vinodi jhooth" vastav main jhooth nahin hote hai
 The saying that "all is fair in love and war" justifies the use of lies to gain advantage in these situations
 san tzu ne ghoshnaa kii ki "sabhi yuddh dhokhe par aadhaarit hote he
 "in Prince macivelli advises that" the one who can be won by deceit should never try to win by force, "and Thomas Hobbes wrote in Leviathan:" Force and fraud are the two cardinal features in war
 " Lying refers to the action in which a person intentionally makes a false statement, with the intention of planting a misconception in the hearer's mind
 Lying abilities emerge from about the third year of age and develop rapidly with age
 School-age children can control their non-verbal expressive behavior
 dhokhaa dene main safal hone ke liye, ek jhooth bolne vaale ko ek jhootha bayaan dene main or jhooth or baad ke bayaan ke bich sangati sunishchit karne main sakasham hona chahie 
ko dhokhe dauraan bayanon ke bich saamanjasy banaae rakhane kii kshamta ke rup main arth risaav niyantran ke liye bheja he
 Children between 3–5 years of age leakage control are disabled and it is not until the age of 7 that children have a complete understanding of earth leakage control
 Meaning leakage control increases with age due to the development of cognitive sophistication
 It is possible that children's ability to maintain their lies may be influenced by their ability to monitor statement discrepancies as they grow older
 6 varsh kii umr or umr laangha jo apane aparaadhon chhipaana jhooth hoga ke 11 saal or apane ko banaae rakhane kii kshamta ke bich bacchon ke bahumat unke umr ke saath bad jaati he he
 Lee states that children are said to have understood the second order beliefs that children had and were likely to maintain their deception
 doosraa aadesh vishwaas isi vastu ke vishay main vishwaas nahin he, lekin duniya main kuch ke bare main kisi or vishwaas ke bare main 
bacchon ko dusron kii maansik rajyon main herpher karne ke liye tang yaa adhik prabhavi dhang se dhokhaa de saktaa he
 They can comfort and ordinarily coordinate their actions with the confidence and desire of their partner
 Three-year-old children usually fail in the misconception task, 4-year-olds achieve some success and 5-year-olds usually show success
 Misconception is evidence that children know that beliefs are not mental representations and are a direct reflection of reality
 miller kii salaah he ki pehle ke aadesh vishwaas ke kaam main kisi ghatana ke liye sidhe sanderbhit karata he or vaastaviktaa sahi darshata he
 Miller also thinks that children can come to the conclusion that sufficient evidence results in no evidence results in knowledge, insufficient evidence or ignorance, and inconsistent evidence results in ambiguity
 The first-rate argument is associated with trust for one goal over another
 The rank argument is associated with two goals
 miller ban gaya he ki bacchon ko aamtaur par duusare kram samaj ko pradarshit karne se pehle ve swayan prastuti, ek lag rahaa he ki pataa chalata he ki sangyanatmak kshamta aavashyak he guru
5 varsh kii aayu tak bachche is vishay main sahi nirnay lene lagate hai ki kaise anya logon kii pratikriyaayein, vibhinn saamaajik bhaawanaaon ko vyakt karti hai 
 saat varsh ke bacchon ke pehle ke aadesh kii jaankaree kaa upyog karne ke liye bhaawanaaon nyaayadhish karne main sakasham hai
 It is only around the age of 9 that children begin to truly understand the importance of second order

 Social psychology and developmental psychology are concerned with the theory of mind, which people follow in their stories to simulate their reaction to others and determine another that a lie will be credible
 The most commonly cited milestone, known as intelligence sly, lies in what is easily lies at the age of about four and a half years, when children are able to start
 Previously, they are generally unable to understand why they are not understanding the events they are understanding - and they feel that there is only one view that is theirs
 chote bachche apane anubhav se sikhte hai ki ek asaty unhen dushkarm ke liye milane vaali sazaa se bachaa sakate hai, isse pehle ki yah kyon kaam karata he is baat ko samajhane ke liye aavashyak man ke siddhant ko viksit kar sake
 vikaas ke is str main, bachche kabhi kabhi apmanjanak or avishwasaneey jhooth bolte hai, kyonki ve unamem is vaicharik dhaanche kii ki kya ek bayaan vishwasaneey he, yaa vishwasaneeyata kii avadharana ko samajhane tak kii kami hoti he
 When children first learn how lying works, they lose their moral sense to stay away from it
 yah varshon se logon ko jhooth bolte hue dekhne kaa nateeja hota he or in juthi baton kaa parinaam hota he, ek behatar samaj kaa viksit karnaa

 According to all three, there is no situation in which a person lied
 One should die, suffer torture, suffer, but should not lie, even if it is only a position to protect the life by lies
 Each of these philosophers gave many arguments against lying and they all correspond with each other

 Criticism of lying conditionally that the Bible facilitates exchanges ,
 Most famously, "you must not tolerate perjury" in the Ten Commandments, a specific reference to perjury

 karol dwek stenford vishvavidhyalay main psychology kii levis or varjeenia iton professor hai
 Dweck is known for his work on the psychological practice of mentalism
 unhone 1 9 67 main barnard college se snaatak kiya or 1 9 72 main yel vishvavidhyalay se piechdi arjeet kiya
 He taught at Columbia University, Harvard University, and the University of Illinois before joining the Stanford faculty in 2004
 karol dwek neuyork main paidaa hui thi
 His father worked in import-export and his mother in advertising
 vah keval ek beti thi or teen bacchon ke madhya beti thi
 Dweck excelled in school
 grad chah main, vah kahati thi ki vah kaksha main baithte hue sochati thi, "yah bahut dilachasp nahin he" yaa "main iske saath sahamat nahin hum", lekin vah kuch nahin kahati thi
 His sixth grade members used to sit in order of their IQ scores
 vah jaldi se manyata praapt he ki uske skool ke vaataavaran ne aikyuu score ko puraskrit kiya jaataa he
 Students with the highest IQ scores can erase the blackboard, take a flag, or take a note to the principal's office
 vah ek 2015 kii saakshaatkaar main bataati he, "ek taraf, mujhe vishwaas nahin tha ki pariksha mejunk mahatvapurn the, duusari taraf, har chaatr us dhaanche main safal hona chahta he jo sthapit he
 The glory of IQ was a major point of my development
 " Carroll married David Goldman, a national theater director and critic
 haalanki unke paas khud ke bachche nahin the, unke pati ke do bade bachche hai, jinke bachche dwek ko "daadi" kehete hai
 She explains that the grandchildren have a growth mindset and says "their parents have done a great job!" dwek hameshaa logon main dilchaspee rakhti thi or sikhti thi ki ve aisa kyon karte hai
 This interest deepened in college
 usne kaha he: "manovigyaan ne mere kai hiton ko jod liya he: main vaigyanik paddati se pyaar karata hum - apane vichaaron ko pariksha main daalana - or mujhe manovigyaan kaa maanviya vishay pasand aayaa
 " grajuet skool ke baad unki pehali naukari illinois vishvavidhyalay main thi
 They spent 11 years completing research projects and observing why people reacted differently to failure and what it meant for their future success
 2012 main ek saakshaatkaar main, vah kahati he, "main log asafalataa yaa baadhaon se kaise muqabla karte hai, is baat se mujhe sammohan hua tha
 i was curious to know why some students like the challenge and others who may be equally talented, play the challenges with shame, just wanted to understand
 dwek ke liye prerana, vyaktitv or vikaas praathmik anusandhan hit he
 She teaches personality and social development as well as motivation courses
 saamaajik manovigyaan main unka pramukh yogadan budhimattake antarnihit siddhanton se sambandhit he|unke pustak maansikta: safalataa kaa nai manovigyaan me bhi yahi suchit hota he|dwek ke anusaar, vyaktiyon ko unke kshamta ke strot pe nirpeksh vichaaron ke anusaar ek nirantarata par rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Some people believe that their success is based on basic competence; They are said to have a "definite" theory of intelligence
 Others, who believe that their success is based on hard work, learning, training, and sharpness, are said to be the "growth" or "incremental" principles
 vyaktiyon ko jaruri nahin ki unki apni maansikta ke bare main pataa ho, lekin unki maansikta abhi bhi unke vyavhaar ke aadhaar par jaani ja sakati he
 This is particularly evident in his response to failure
 nishchit maansikta vaale vyakti vifaltaa se darate hai kyonki yah unki buniyadi kshamtaaon par ek nakaaratmak kathan he, jabaki vikaas maansikta vyaktiyon ke man yaa dimag main dar nahin padataa he kyonki ve mahasoos karte hai ki unke pradarshan main sudhaar kiya ja saktaa he or vifaltaa se sikh sakate he
 Both these mindsets play an important role in all aspects of a person's life
 dwek kaa tark he ki vikaas maansikta ek vyakti ko ek kam tanaavpurn or adhik safal jivan jeene ke liye madad karegaa
 Definitions of fixed and growth mindset from a 2012 interview: yah mahatvapurn he kyonki "vikaas" siddhant vaale vyakti asafalataaon ke baavjood kadi mehnat karte hante or vyaktiyon ke budhimatta siddhanton ko sookshm paryaavaran sanketon se prabhavit kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, saying "you are too smart" to praise children for good work is more likely to develop a certain mindset, whereas if praise for good work is given, "you worked very hard Is "so they can develop a growth mindset
 duusare shabdon main, chaatro ko protsaahit karnaa sambhav he, udhaaharan ke liye, unhen ek nishchit tareeke se seekhney ke bare main sochane ke liye protsaahit karke vifal rahane ke baavjood jari rahanaa he
 Dweck's research challenges the common belief that intelligent people are born smart
 jaisaa ki dvekne samajhaayaa, vikaas maansikta bas prayaas ke bare main nahin he 
 Perhaps the most common misconception can be that the growth mindset is just like effort
 "vikaas kii maansikta kaa uddeshy kaa yash ke bich ke antaraal ko kam karne ke liye madad karnaa he, unhen chhipaana nahin
 It is to tell the truth about a student's current achievement and then, together, do something about it, to help make him or her smarter
 dwek salaah dete hai, "yadi mata-pita apane bacchon ko ek uphaar dena chaahate hai, to ve sabase acchhee baat yah kar sakate hai ki ve apane bacchon ko chunautiyon se pyaar karne, galatiyon se dwaara chintit, prayaason kaa anand lene, or sikhte rahane ke liye prerana de sakate he
 In this way, their children will not have to become slaves of praise
 unke aatmavishvaas kaa nirmaan or marammat karne ke liye unke paas ek jivan bhar kaa rasta hoga
 "dweck warns of the dangers of praising intelligence because it puts children in a certain mindset, and they won't want to be challenged because they don't want to look stupid or make mistakes
 vah kehete hai, "bacchon kii buddhi kii prashansa prerana se haani pahunchaati he or yah pradarshan ko haani pahunchaata he
 " jaisaa ki dwek dwaara samajhaayaa gaya he, is paddati se ham bacchon ke parvarish ke liye ek nae krantikari drushtikon kaa pataa chalata he - hamen prayaas ko saraahna chahie naa ki pratibha; ki hame chunautiyon ko khataron kii bajaay seekhney ke avasaron ko dekhne ke liye bacchon ko padhaane chahie; or hamen is baat par jor dena chahie ki kshamtaaon ko kaise badla ja saktaa he
 Experiments around the world have shown that when parents and teachers adopt this approach, and stick to it, the results are extraordinary
 carol dwek ne 2017-18 skool varsh ke liye stenford main ek manovigyaan ke professor ke rup main ek shikshan upasthiti rakhaa hua hai, vikasshil manovigyaan, swa-siddhant, or swatantra adhyayan ko padhaati hai
 She says, "I hope that my 21st century work can empower people to achieve greater personal freedom and equality
" " Dweck has explained his current focus "I am now developing a comprehensive theory that understands the formation of motivation and mood at the heart of social and personality development
" ummid he ki yah vikaas main or bhi adhik yuva vidwaanon ko prerana ke manovigyaan ke adhyayan ke liye aakarshith karegaa 
 " sabase haal hi main, carol dwek ne shaikshik pahaluon main sabase bada puraskaar 3
8 million dollar praapt kiya, jo seekhney kii kshamta par apana shodh jari rakhane ke liye diya gaya he
 Dweck said in a statement, "I am thrilled and honored to receive the inaugurator of this amazing award
 yah hamen apana kaam aage le jane or nae sire se jari rakhane kii anumati degaa - chaatro ke liye or adhik prabhavi hastkshep viksit karne ke liye or adhik prabhavi saamagree shikshak kakshaon main upyog karne ke liye madad milegi

 Kalil or colloid is a chemical mixture in which one object is uniformly dispersed in another
 parikshepit vastu ke kan mishran me keval nilambit rahete he naa ki ek vilyan kii tarah 
 This is because the size of the particles in the membrane is larger than the size of the particles present in the solution - these particles are so small that they are completely dispersed in the mixture to form a homogenous mixture, but not so large that the light Scour and do not dissolve
 is parikshepan ke chalate kuch kalil vilyan jaise dikhte hai
 a bud system has two distinct phases: the first dispersion phase and the second continuous phase
 ek kalil pranali thos, drav yaa gasiy ho sakati he
 The table below gives a comparative analysis of the diameter of the particles of the plume in a homogenous and uniform mixture
 : Therefore, the collicular suspensions are intermediates for homogenous and homogeneous mixtures
 kalil ke liye angreji main kollid shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The word is derived from the Greek word kola which means 'glue'
 san 1861 i
 main ek angrej vaigyanik, tamas graham, ne dekha ki albumin, sares, gond, maand, silisik amla or isi prakaar ke anya padaarth jal main ghole jane par jaev jhilli ke chhidron se chhanakar nahin nikal pate
 In contrast, hydrolysis of sugars, urea, sodium, chloride, etc
 are released from the pores of the bio-membrane
 purv prakaar ke padaarth adhikansh main acristalia rup main milte hai is gun ke aadhaar par jal main viley padaartho kaa do virgon main vibhaajan kiya gaya: ek ve padaarth, jo crystalia the or jal main vilyan ke pashchaat jaev jhilli ke chhidron se bahirgat ho sakate the, crystalloid kehalaae or duusare ve, jo acristalia the or jal main gholne par jaev jhilli ke chhidron se nikalne main samarth nahin ho sakate the, kalil kehalaae
 But now it has been proved that crystalline substances like sugars and sodium chloride can also be obtained in the appropriate medium in the form of pigments
 kalilavastha main kalil kan ek avichhinn madhyam main bikhare rahete hai
 Thus, there are two components in the buds
 neeche kii suchi main pehla naam madhyam kaa or doosraa naam vitarit padaarth kaa he : The size of the calculus is particularly important
 aakaar main kalilkan anuon se bade hote hai, kintu aise sabhi kanon se, jo sookshmdarshi se dekhe ja sakate hai, ye aakaar main chote rahete hai
 They extend 10–5 cm
 From 10–7 cm Happens till
 yadhyapi upar di gai suchi ke prayek mail ke kalil praapt kiye ja sakate hai, phir bhi or prakaar ke kalil adhik prayukt hote hai or inhen kaa adhyayan bhi adhik vistaarpurvak kiya gaya he
 The solids of the solid or liquid distributed in the medium of water are called Sauls
 carbonic or acarbonic donon prakaar ke padaarth anek roopon main kalilavastha main paae jate hai
 Scientifically or technically, there is hardly any branch in which the buds are not used significantly
 apni isimhatta ke kaaran kalil vigyaan vishesh rup se hota gaya he
 In order to distinguish between the qualities of the Kalils, they have been divided into two major classes
 pehle varg main dhatviya prakaar ke kalil, jaise swarna kalil aadi, hai or duusare varg main protein prakaar ke kalil hai, jaise gelatin aadi
 Their special qualities are as follows: in donon prakaar ke kalilon ke liye jin shabdon kaa vishesh prayog hota he ve hai jalasantrasi or jalpremi 
 They are also called lyophobic and lyophilic in English in order
 yah vargeekaran purnroopen santoshjanak nahin kaha ja saktaa, kyonki katipay kalilon ke kuch gun donon charam virgon ke apokshakrit gunon ke madhyavarti hote hai
 These types of waterways have some metal oxides or hydroxides, some insoluble phosphate, molybdate, tungstate etc
 kuch log kalilon ko alambaabh or pysabh ke do virgon main vibhajit karte hai
 Apart from these, there is also a third category of Kalils which has become particularly important now
 yah varg kalileey vidyudvishleshya kehalaata he
 Soap water is a typical example of this
 in jalakalilon main vidyucchalakata bhi hoti he
 They are now being used more as refinements
 kalilon main atisookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se browneey gati ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Mergers do not have this action
 jab ek twri kiranpath kendrit karke jalakalil ke madhya se bheji jaati he tab kiranpath dugdhabh ho jaataa he or bahirgat kirane dhravatv praapt kar leti hai
 The reasons for this are the similarity in the size and wavelength of light and the uniformity in the wavelength of the distributed matter and the wavelength of the light and the alternation of the opposing material exceeds the mean of the different medium
 shaktishaalee sookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se tindal ke prabhaav dwaara kalilkanon ko dekha ja saktaa he
 When viewed in this way, the calculus appears like the illuminated stars
 saath hi inaki gati twri, aniyamit or nirantar hoti he
 This motion is called Brownian motion
 isi gati se padaartho ke gatyaatmakataa-siddhant ke vichaaron kii praayogic pushti hui he
 By extracting the Avogadro constant according to this theory, it has been proved that the values of the Avogadro-constant derived from this method by considering the experimental error are comparable to the values of the constant extracted from other methods
 parin ne mastic gond ke kalil par pariksha karke aavogadro niyatank kaa maan 6
510E23 nikaala he
 The radius of the appropriate mastic glue particles in the experiment was 6
5 x 10–4
 anek pravidhik vidhiyon ke liye kalil nirmit karnaa aavashyak he
 Hydrographic plains can only be made easily, because watertight plots are reversible
 jalasantrasi kalilon ke nirmaan ke liye kai vidhiyaan prayukt hoti hai
 These methods can be divided into two classes - integration and disintegration
 pehali vidhi main aanaviya aakaar ke kanon ko dhire-dhire tab tak badhaayaa jaataa he jab tak ve kalilon kaa aakaar nahin praapt kar lete or unke adhik badhane kii gati kisi sthayitv pradaan karanevaale padaarth kii upasthiti se, athwa kisi jalpremi kalil ke mila dene se, niyantrit kar di jaati he
 By this method many metals, hydroxides, insoluble salts and silver halides used in photography have been made in the bud
 duusari vidhi se bade-bade kanon ko chote-chote kanon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 In the braiding method metal pieces are obtained by breaking large pieces of metals with the help of electric arc
 is kaaran is vidhi ko vighatan kii vidhi kaha jaataa he, kintu vastav main ye kalil bhi ekikaran kii vidhi se hi banate hai
 The metal evaporates at high temperature of the arc
 phir vaashp ke ati sookshm kan ekikrut hokar kalilkanon kaa aakaar praapt kar lete hai
 In fact kalil-mill is the major means of making Kalil by partition
 is yantra main do platen, jo ek duusare ke atyant sameep rahati hai, paraspar vipareet disha main gumti he
 The material to be delivered is sent between these two plates with the appropriate medium
 is prakaar kan chote hokar kalil kanon kaa aakaar grahan kar lete hai
 For the treatment of the buds produced by any of the two methods, they are subjected to a different action by dialysis with a geminal substance
 aisa karne ke liye kalil ko parchament yaa celophen ke jhole main rakhaa jaataa he
