 Ismail al-faruqi and Taha Jabir Alalwani are of the view that any revival of Muslim civilization must begin with the Quran; However, the biggest obstacle on this passage is the centuries-old legacy of "tafsir and other classical disciplines that prevent the" universal, epistemological, and systematic conception "of the Quranic message

 In native Arabic, the surya and verses employ phonetic and thematic structures that aid the audience's efforts to recall the message of the text
 muslim jor den ki quran kii saamagree or style anuchit he
 The language of the Quran is described as "poetry prose" because it is part of both poetry and prose; However, this description runs the risk of failing to convey the rhythmic quality of the Quranic language, which is more poetic in some parts and more prose-like in others
 quran, jabaki puure quran main paaya gaya tha, pehle ke kai makka suras main vishisht he, jisamen apekshaakrit kam chand gayan ke shabdon ko pramukhataa main phenk dete hai

 Michael Bells, citing Brown's work, accepts Brown's observation that the seemingly disintegration of Quranic literary expression - its scattered or fragmented mode of sale phrase - is in fact a literary device capable of giving deep impact
 As if the intensity of the prophetic message was breaking the vehicle of human language in which it was being conveyed

 Self-referentiality is evident in those paragraphs where the Quran refers to itself as revealing itself in a self-sufficient way, as news, as a norm

 Tafsir is one of the earliest educational activities of Muslims
 quran ke anusaar, mohammad pehla vyakti tha jisane praarambhik musalamaanon ke liye chhandon ke arthon kaa varnan kiya tha
 Other early bodies included some of Muhammad's companions, such as 'ali ibn Abi Talib,' Abdullah ibn Abbas, Abdullah ibn Umar and Ubayy ibn Kab

 Muhammad Husayn Tababatei states that according to popular explanations among later passages, tawil means that a verse has been instructed
 tawal ke virodh main, prakaashan kaa arth, shabdon ke spasht arth ke anusaar spasht he, jaisaa ki unhen bataaya gaya tha
 But this explanation has become so widespread that, at present, it has become the primary meaning of tawil, which originally meant "to return" or "return place"
 tabatai ke vichaar main, jise taivil yaa quran kii harmenutic vyakhya kaha jaataa he, ko shabdon ke sanket ke saath chintit nahin he
 Rather, it deals with some truths and realities that are beyond the comprehension of the common part of men; Yet it is from these truths and realities that the doctrine of doctrine and the practical prohibition of the Quran continue
 vyakhya kavita kaa arth nahin he balki yah us arth ke madhyam se pargaman ke ek vishesh prakaar main paardarshee he

 shiya manyataon ke anusaar, jo mohammad or imam jaise gyaan main dridhtaa se nihit hai, quran ke rahasyon ko jaanate hai
 According to Tabatai, the statement "no one knows its interpretation except God" remains valid without any adversary or qualification clause
 isliye, jahaan tak is kavita kaa sawaal he, quran kii vyakhya kaa gyaan bhagwaan ke liye arakshit he
 But Tabatabaei uses other verses and concludes that those who are purified by God know to some extent the interpretation of the Quran
 tabatai ke anusaar, sweekaarya or asweekaarya gudh vyakhyaayein hai
 Acceptable ta'wil refers to the meaning of a poem beyond its literal meaning; Rather the underlying meaning, which is ultimately known only to God and cannot be directly understood through human thought alone
 prashn main chand yahaan aane, jane, baithne, santushti, krodh or dukh ke maanviya gunon ko sanderbhit karte hai, jinhen spasht rup se bhagwaan ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya jaataa he 
 The unacceptable ta'wil is one where the apparent meaning of a poem "transfers" to a different meaning through a proof; This method is not without obvious discrepancies
 yadhyapi yah asweekaarya ta'vil ne kaaphi sweekruti praapt kii he, yah galat he or kuranik chhandon par lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The correct interpretation is that reality refers to a poem
 yah sabhi chhandon main paaya jaataa he, nirnaayak or aspasht ek jaise; yah shabd kaa arth nahin he; yah ek tathy he ki shabdon ke liye bahut shandaar he
 God has prepared them with words to bring a little to their minds; In this respect they are like stories that are used to create a picture in the mind, and thus help the listener to clearly understand the intended idea

 kintu is swatantraaa ke saath ishwar ne dharti par based manushyon ko thik us rup main jivan guzaarane ke liye ishwariya adeshon ke pahunchane kaa prabandh kiya or dharti ke har bhaag main usne apane doot bheje, jinhone manushyon tak ishwar kaa sandesh bheja
 The number of such messengers is said to be around 1,84,000
 is silsile kii antim kadi hazarat mohammad the
 No messenger will come after you, but Hazrat Jesus will spend the rest of his life on this earth again
 ishwar kii antim kitaab aapke haath main he koi or ishwariya kitaab ab nahin aegi
 His message was one, his mission was one, to teach human beings to live according to the divine command, for thousands of years of constant prophets, whether they had descended into any part of the earth
 hazaron varshon kaa samay bitne ke kaaran ishwariya adeshon main manushya apane vichaar, apni suvidha jod kar nayaa dharm bana lete or mul dharm ko vikrut kar ek aadambar khadaa kar dete or kai baar to ishwariya adeshon ke viparit kaary karte
 Because every effective person wanted to see everyone bow down before his power
 akhir antim nabi hazarat mohammad koran ke saath is dharti par aae or koran ishwar ke is chalange ke saath aayaa ki isaki raksha swayan ishwar karegaa
 a long time of 1500 years suggests that even after all the efforts of the Quranic opponents, not a single word of the Quran has been changed
 yah kitaab apane mul swaroop main pralay tak rahegi
 Along with this, the challenge of the Quran is still in place that those who do not consider it to be a divine book, they should show a complete book like this and not just a small part of it
 koran ke is rup ko jaanane ke baad yah jaan lijie ki yah kitaab rup main hazarat mohammad ko nahin di gai ki ise padhakar logon ko suna den or chhap kar har ghar main rakh den
 Rather, from time to time for 23 years, this book has emerged as per requirement and you have made the society on earth according to his orders at the will of God, as God had ordered

ji
wales ke anusaar is dharti par pravachan to bahut die gaye kintu un pravachanon ke aadhaar par ek samaaj kii rachana pehali baar hazarat mohammad ne karke dikhaai
 It would be interesting to know here that Wales is not an Islam lover but anti-islam and his books have been published in opposition to Islam
 vaigyanik tathy jo ab tak hamen gyaat hai, koran main chupe hai or aise saikadon sthaan he jahaan lagata he ki manushya gyaan abhi us haqiqat tak nahin pahunchaa he
 Again and again the Quran gives you a feast to ponder
 zamin or aasmaan ke rahasyon ko jaanane kaa aamantran detaa hai
 a confusion ensues
 kuran ke daawey ke anusaar vah puri dharti ke manushyon ke liye or shesh samay ke liye he, kintu uske sambodhit us samay ke arab nazar aate hai
 It seems cursory that the Qur'an was only for the Arabs of that time, but whenever you reach a place when it seems that this thing is only for a particular time and country, then stop there
 Think or note it and consider it later, you will feel that every time a human being is one of every age and every terrain, and the same thing applies to them as the people of that time
 Used to apply to Arabs
 musalamaanon ke liye koran ke sambandh main badi badi kitaaben likhi gai hai or likhi ja sakati hai
 The purpose here is to give a brief introduction of the Qur'an and clarify what is right on its Ummah
 hazarat ali se rivaayat kii gai ek haddees he
 Hazrat Haris states that when i entered the mosque, i saw some people quarreling in some problems
 main hazarat ali ke paas gaya or unhen is baat kii soochna di
 Hazrat Ali ordered - Did these things happen? i said yes
 hazarat ali ne farmaaya- yaad rakho maine rasul allaah se suna he
 You ordered - Beware, a big head will be raised near me, i have requested - what will be the means of getting rid of this situation? The Book of Allah
 koran kaa sara nichod is ek haddees main aa jaataa he
 The last book of Allah on the Qur'an is in line with his fame
 yah atyant aasaan he or yah bahut kathin bhi he
 Easy when it is read to remember
 yadi aap kii niyat main khot nahin he or koran se hidaayat chaahate hai to allaah ne is kitaab ko aasaan bana diya he
 This is the easiest book in the world to understand and remember
 khud koran me he 'or hamane koran ko samajhane ke liye aasaan kar diya he, to koi he ki soche or samajhe?' On the other hand, from the point of view of telescopes, it is the world's hardest book, even after spending entire life it is not possible to measure its depth
 is drushti se dekha jaae to yah ek samudr he
 Houses have passed and the miracle of the Quran still prevails
 or sadiyaan biit jaaengi kintu koran kaa chamatkaar kabhi samaapt nahin hoga
 The only easy way to get instruction is to pay attention to the persistent verses and believe in the verses that this too is from Allah
 duniya nirantar pragati kar rahi he, maanav gyaan nirantar bad rahaa he, jo koran main kal mutshabihaat tha aaj vah spasht ho chukaa he, or kal uske kuch ore bhaag spasht honge
 Similarly, two different methods have to be adopted for learning
 adeshon ke lihaaz se koran main vichaar karne vaale ko peeche kii ore yatra kerani hogi
 The meaning of the Qur'an's order was seen by theologians, scholars (tabatabai, Tabai'in)
 ) or sahaba ne iskaa kya arth liya
 Even to give himself to the steps of Hazrat Muhammad, what was the order of the Quran itself? duusari ore gyanvigyaan ke lihaaz se aage or nirantar aage vichaar karnaa hoga
 Go beyond it not just with time
 manushya ke gyaan kii sataha nirantar oonchi hoti ja rahi he
 The Quran has the highest level of science, considering that new inventions, discoveries and scientific facts can be worked on
 muajaza us chamatkaar ko kehete hai jo kisi nabi yaa rasul ke haath par ho or maanav shakti se pare ho, jis par maanav budhdi hairaan ho jaae
 In the same way, there are many more
 har yug main jab bhi koi rasul ishwariya adeshon ko maanav tak pahunchataa, tab use allaah kii ore se chamatkaar die jate the
 Hazrat Musa was granted as many miracles
 hazarat isa ko murdon ko jivit karnaa, bimaaron ko thik karne kaa muajaza diya gaya
 The real opportunity of any prophet is that which he presents with a claim
 hazarat mohammad ke haath par saikadon maajaze varnit hai, kintu jo daawey ke saath pesh kiya gaya or jo aaj bhi chamatkaar ke rup main vishwa ke samaksh maujuud he, vah he koran jiskaa yah chelenz duniya ke samaksh anuttarit he ki iske ek bhaag jaisaa hi bana kar dikhaa diya jaae
 This claim was made at many places in the Quran
 The Qur'an will be completely safe, the claim has passed 1500 years and the Qur'an is safe, completely safe
 yah siddh ho chukaa he, jo ek chamatkaar he
 In the same way, there are many more
 koran vigyaan kii kasuti par khara utraa he, or uske vaigyanik varnanon ke aage vaigyanik natmastak hai
 This is also a miracle
 1500 varsh purv arab ke registan main ek anpadh vyakti ne aisi kitaab prastut kii jo beesvin sadi ke saare sadhano ke saamne apni satyata zaahir kar rahi he
 If any other book has done this work other than the Quran, the world would like to know its name
 koran kaa yah chamatkaarik rup aaj hamaare liye he or ho saktaa he aage aane vaale samay ke liye uskaa koi or chamatkaarik rup saamne aae
 When the Quran was incarnated, its main miracle in that era was not its scientific basis
 us yug main koran kaa chamatkaar tha uski bhashaa, sahitya, vagmita, jisane apane samay ke arabon ke bhashaa gyaan ko jhakzor diya tha
 It would be appropriate to clarify here that the Arabs of that time were so proud of their language knowledge that they called the people of the rest of the world Ajami
 koran kii style ke kaaran arab ke bhashaa gyaniyon ne apane ghutane tech die
 The Quran is a book based on which a revolution was brought
 registan ke aise anpadh logon ko jinka vishwa ke nakshe main us samay koi mahatv nahin tha
 Due to the teachings of the Quran, the training of his presenter brought him to the great powers of that time and a Quranic society was created in just 23 years which the world can never answer
 aaj bhi duniya maanati he ki koran or hazarat mohammad ne ek adarsh samaaj kii rachana kii
 From this point of view, if you study the Qur'an, then you have to walk with it
 uski shiksha par amal karen
 Not only in private life but in social, political and legal areas, then all those characters mentioned in the Quran will be seen alive
 ve sari kathinaayee or ve sari pareshaani saamne ajaaengi
 If the gang rises for this work with body, mind, money, then the instruction of the Quran will guide it at every turn
 koran allaah kii rassi he
 There is a hadith described by Hazrat Zaid bin Araqam in the Tirmizi which states that the Qur'an is the rope of Allah which stretches from the ground to the Assaman
 yah shabd huzur ke he jinhe hazarat zayd ne varnit kiya he
 In the same way, there are many more
 tabraani main varnit ek or haddees he jisamen kaha gaya he ki ek din huzur masjid main tasharif laae to dekha kuch log ek kone main baithe koran pard rahe hai or ek duusare ko samajha rahe hai
 Seeing this, a wave of happiness ran over your face
 aap sahaba ke us gut ke paas pahunche or un se kaha- kya tum maanate ho ki allaah ke atirikt koi anya mabood nahin he, main allaah kaa rasul hun or koran allaah kii kitaab he? sahaba ne kaha, yaa rasul allaah ham gavaahi dete hai ki allaah ke atirikt koi mabood nahin, aap allaah ke rasul hai or koran allaah kii kitaab he
 Then you said, rejoice that the Quran is the rope of Allah with one end in his hand and the other in your hand
 The Qur'an is also the rope of Allah in the sense that it binds the Muslims together
 unamem vichaaron kii ekta, mat bhinnata ke samay allaah ke adeshon se nirnay or jivan ke liye ek adarsh namoona prastut karata he
 In the same way, there are many more
 khud koran main he ki allaah kii rassi ko majbuti se pakad lo
 There is no conflict between any faction of Muslims on the basis of the Quran
 koran kaa haq koran ke har musalmaan par paanch haq hai, jo use apni shakti or samarthy ke anusaar purna karnaa chahie
 To understand the Quran, it is important to know the background of its incarnation
 yah is tarah kii kitaab nahin he ki ise puraa likh kar pigambar ko dekar kah diya gaya ho ki jaao isaki ore logon ko bulaao
 Rather, on the occasion of the Quran, which was started by Arab Muhammad in Arabia, the Qur'an was descended according to necessity
 aarambh se jaise hi koran kaa kuch bhaag avatarit hota aap use likhva dete or yah bhi bataa dete ki yah kiske saath padhaa jayega
 In order of incarnation, scholars have divided the Quran into two parts
 ek makki bhaag, doosraa madani bhaag
 Initially, there were minor appearances in maize
 unki bhashaa shreshth, prabhavi or arabon kii pasand ke anusaar shreshth saahitiyik darje vaali thi
 His words used to fall in the heart
 uske daivie sangeet se kaan usko sunne main lag jate or uske daivie prakaash se log aakarshith ho jate yaa ghabara jate
 It described the laws of creation on which human wonder is still astonishing after centuries, but all examples were local for this
 unheen ke itihaas, unhi kaa maahaul
 This went on for five years
 iske baad makke kii rajnatik tathaa aarthik satta par qabze vaale logon ne apane liye is khatre ko bhaanp kaa zulm va jyaadati kaa vah tandav kiya ki musalamaanon kii jo thodi sankhya thi usamen bhi kai logon ko gharbaar chhod kar habsha janaa padaa
 The prophet himself had to be imprisoned with all the family members in a valley and eventually left Mecca and went to Medina
 musalamaanon par yah bada sakht samay tha or allaah ne is samay jo koran nazil kiya usamen talwaar kii kaat or baadh kii tezi thi
 Which shook the entire area
 musalamaanon ke liye tasalli or is kathin samay main kii jane vaali prarthanaaain hai jo is aath varsh ke koran kaa mukhya bhaag raheen
 It is clear from this violent episode that the influence of human creativity and emotions was in the composition of this book
 makki daur ke teraa varsh baad madeene main musalamaanon ko ek kendra praapt ho gaya
 Where all the believers gathered and the incarnation of the third round began
 yahan musalamaanon kaa do nae prakaar ke logon se parichay hua
 The first Jews who had been inhabited here for centuries and according to their religious faith were waiting for the last prophet
 kintu antim nabi ko unhone apane atirikt duusari qaom main dekha to utpaat machaa diya
 During this period in the Quran, strict comments were made in the Quran on the book Ahle
 isi yug main kutachariyon kaa ek gut musalamaanon main paidaa ho gaya jo musalmaan hone kaa naatak karte or virodhiyon se mili rahat It was here that the Muslims got the permission for the armed struggle and they had to constantly face the attacks of the Meccans
 duusari ore ek islamic rajya kii sthapana ke saath puure samaaj kii rachana ke liye ishwariya niyam avatarit hue
 War, peace, justice, social customs and food, God's command of all are characteristic of the Qur'an of this era
 jinke aadhaar par samaajik barabari kaa ek adarsh rajya allaah ke rasul ne khadaa kar diya
 On the basis of this, even today, the order of Hazrat Muhammad is considered to be the first among the world heroes
 unhone jivan ke har kshaitra main zabaani nirdesh nahin die, balki us par amal karke dikhaaya
 Due to this background, the same thing has to be repeated many times in the Quran
 akeshwarwad, dharmik aadesh, swarg, narak, sabar , dharm parayanata ke vishay hai jo baar baar dohraye gaye
 The Quran was a straightforward, noble business man who was living a rich life in his family
 vishwa kii do mahaan shaktiyon ke samaksh khadaa kar diya
 Not only this, he has made the illiterate people of the desert so civilized that even after hundreds of years the pursuit of this civilization on the whole world cannot be rescued
 koran ne yudhd, shanti, rajya sanchaalan ibaadat, parivaar ke ve adarsh prastut kiye jiskaa maanav samaaj main aaj prabhaav he
 a few years ago, a group of Arabs collected verses from the Qur'an relating to the scriptures and translated them into English, Prof
 Presented to Dr
 Keith Moore, Professor of Embryology and Head of the University of Toronto
 is samay vishwa main bhrun shaastra ke sarvocch gyaata maane jate hai
 They were asked to present their views on the verses related to embryology in the Quran
 unhone unka adhyayan karne ke pashchaat kaha ki bhrun shaastra ke sambandh main koran main varnan thik aadhunik khojon ke anuroop hai
 Regarding some verses, he said that he cannot call it wrong or right because he himself is unaware of it
 isamen sabase pehle nazil kii gai koran kii vah aayat bhi shaamil thi jiskaa anuwaad he
 Take the name of your family and study, who created it
 jisane insaan ko khun kii footki se banaaya
 In this, a word has been used in Arabic language, it has one meaning of the foot of blood and the other means like leech
 dow
 moore ko us samay tak yah gyaat nahin tha ki kya mata ke garbh main aarambh main bhrun kii surat jonk kii tarah hoti he
 He conducted his experiments on this and after study said that initially in the mother's womb, the fetus is in the shape of leech
 dow kith moore ne bhrun shaastra ke sambandh main 80 prashnon ke uttar die jo koran or haddees main varnit hai
 In the same way, there are many more
 unhi ke shabdon main, yadi 30 varsh purv mujhase yah prashn puche jate to main inamen aadhe bhi uttar nahin de paata
 Because till then science had not made so much progress in this area
 In 1981, at the Saudi Medical Conference, Dr
 Moore announced that he had come to believe that Hazrat Muhammad was a prophet of God by looking at the verses of the Qur'an's embryology
 kyon ki sadiyon purv jab vigyaan khud bhrun avasthaa main ho itani sateek baaten keval ishwar hi kah saktaa he
 Dr
 Moore has included everything in the 1982 edition of his book which is available in many languages and is taught to first-year medical students
 is kitaab ko kisi ek vyakti dwaara chikitsa shaastra ke kshaitra main likhi kitaab kaa award bhi mil chukaa he
 There are hundreds of examples that you will read continuously in this commentary of the Quran
 mat bhinnata ek etraz kiya jaataa he ki jab koran itani sidhd kitaab he to uski tikaa main hazarat mohammad se ab tak vidwaanon main mat bhinnata kyon he
 Suffice it to say here that Prophet Muhammad encouraged healthy discrimination among his followers, but you did not like bigotry and factionalism based on differences
 sehatmand matbhinnata samaaj kii pragati main sadaiv sahaayak hoti he or gutbandi sadaiv nuqasaan pahunchaati he
 Therefore, the differences of Islamic scholars have also helped to work in the Qur'an hadith and in the creation of an ideal society, but the damage has been caused by factionalism by developing this differences in a radical way
 shabdic vahya koran hazarat mohammad par avatarit hua vah ishwariya shabdon main tha
 It is literal, not as meaning
 yah baat isliye spashth karnaa padi ki isai shikshan sansthaaon main yah shiksha di jaati he ki vahya ishwariya shabdon main nahin hoti balki nabi ke hriday par uskaa arth aata he jo vah apane shabdon main varnit kar detaa he
 This belief is important for Christians because they could tell the truth about the changes they made in the Bible
 puraa isai or yahudi vishwa sadiyon se yah prayaas kar rahaa he ki kisi prakaar yah sidhd kar de ki koran hazarat mohammad ke shabd hai or unki rachana he
 Many books have been written about this and efforts have been made to prove it in many ways but none have been able to achieve this success so far

 Different types of breeds are found in the Orinoco and Amazon basins
 machhliyon ke parivaar The Indian numeral system is known as hindu-arabic numeral system in the countries of the west because European countries had knowledge of this numeral system from the Arab country
 jabaki arabon ko yah gyaan bharat se mila tha
 The Indian numeral system consists of 10 digits totaling zero
 bhartiya ank pranali, sansar kii sarvaadhik prachlit ank pranali hai
 According to the famous French mathematician Pierre Simon Laplace, neeche bhartiya ankon kaa devanagari evam antararashtriya swaroop dikhaaya gaya he- According to historians, Brahmi numerals were prevalent in India in the fourth century BC
 pune evam mumbai ke kshetra kii gufaaon main mili shilalekhon main tathaa uttar pradesh main mili prachinkaal ke sikkon main brahmi ank paye gayi hai
 The decimal system and zero were not used in Brahmi numerals
 apramanik dastavezon ke anusaar bharat main shunya, jo ki dashamalav pranali kaa aadhaar he, kaa avishkaar isvi san kii pratham shatabdi main ho chukaa tha
 However, authentic documents of the invention of zero have been found in India only in the fifth century
 gwalior main paye gayi shilaalekh, jo ki isvi san 870 kaa he, main shunya ke sanket paae gaye hai
 This inscription has been recognized by all historians by one opinion
 shunya ke avishkaar ho jane par bharat main das anko vaali ank pranali kaa prachlan armbh ho gaya jo ki is sansar main prachlit aadhunik ank pranaaliyon kaa aadhaar bani
 In the seventh century CE, Arabia acquired the Indian numeral system
 arab main bhartiya ankon ko gubaar ank or bhartiya ank pranali ko hindusa ank pranali ke naam se janaa jane laga
 Due to the number system obtained from Hindustan, it was named 'hindusa' there
 arab ke mohammad ebn musa al-khwaarizmi naamak vidwaan ke kalkram vivaran ke anusaar, Roman numerals were used in Europe until the twelfth century
 roman ank pranali main keval saat ank hai, jo aksharon dwaara vyakt kiye jate hai
 These are I, V, X, L, C, d and M
 inhen anko ke jod ne ghataane se koi bhi sankhya likhi jaati he
 For example, if you want to write three then write the symbol of one three times III
 aath likhnaa he to paanch ke daayin taraf teen ek-ek ke chinh likhakar jod die or VIII ho gaya
 This system is so difficult and complicated that when Europe was introduced to the Indian numeral system in the twelfth century, it not only accepted it, but adopted it completely
 europe main kuch shatabdiyon baad jo vaigyanik-audyogic kranti hui, uske mul main bhartiya ank gananaa kaa hi yogadan he
 India invented nine digits and zero for calculation
 yahi nahin, ankon ke sthaneey maan kaa bhi avishkaar bharat main hi hua
 There is no value of zero, but if it is written to the right of a digit, it will indicate ten because now the local value of 1 becomes ten
 yadi dahini ore ek or shunya badha diya jaae, to yah sankhya sau ho jaaegi
 In this way, the valueless zero when written to the right of the digit increases the value of the second digit
 sankshep main, sthaan ke anusaar ankon ke mulya nirdhaaran ke siddhanth ko sthaneey maan kehete hai
 It is very easy to write any number from this system
 jis teen sau chavalis ko ham roman pranali main CCC XL IV likhte hai, use bhartiya vidhi se 344 likh sakate hai
 Through this, the largest number can be written briefly without any difficulty
 bhartiya ganit ne dashamalav pranali kaa bhi avishkaar kiya
 The first use of decimal digits in India is found by Aryabhatta I
 sambhav he ki iskaa avishkaar isse bhi bahut pehle hua ho
 But in Europe, the general publication of decimal numbers was done in the seventeenth century, whose knowledge he had definitely gained from India
 ye bhartiya ganitiya siddhanth europe ko arab ke madhyam se praapt hue the
 In Arabic language these numbers are called Hindsa
 hindasa arthath 'hind se praapt'
 The Arabic script is written from right to left, but in Arabic the digits are written from left to right
 yah bhi is baat kaa pramaan he ki arabi ankon kii utpatti arabi bhashaa ke saath arab desh main nahin hui, apitu ye baahar se aayaat kiye gaye hai
 When these Indian numerals reached Europe through the Arabs, they felt that these numbers were invented originally by the Arabs
 atev aaj bhi europe main ek se nau evam shunya ke bhartiya ankon ko ‘erebic neumral’ kehete hai
 In the former Arab country of Islam's prophet Hazrat Mohammed, Jihalia means 'the age of ignorance'
 gyaan-vigyaan main vahaan koi pragati nahin hui thi
 Only seventeen people knew how to write anything in the entire Quraysh clan to which Mohammed Saheb belonged
 kint islam kii sthapana ke saath arab samrajya kaa vistaar pishcham main spain or uttari africa tathaa purv main bharat kii seemaa tak ho gaya
 The Arab system of calculation, which was of very preliminary level, proved inadequate for the economic administration of the countries that were defeated and joined the Arab Empire
 atev vivash hokar arabi shaskaon ko vijit jatiyon ke ankon kaa prayog karnaa padaa
 During the reign of Khalifa al-mansur, some emissaries from Sindh went to Baghdad, including some scholars
 ve apane saath brahmagupta rachit brahmasfoot siddhanth evam khandakhadyak naamak granth bhi anya granthon ke saath baghdad le gaye
 With the help of these scholars, al-fajari and Yakub Khan Tariq translated them into Arabic, which had a special effect on Arabic mathematics
 arab logon main bhartiya gyaan, vigyaan or kala ke prati jo us samay sammaan tha, vah al jahij kii pustika- fakir assam-sudan al-l binad main likhaa haih Leonado of the city of Pisa, who learned Hindu mathematics from a Moore and wrote a book called Liber Avaiki in 1202, revised edition in 1228
 isamen usne hindu ankon or unki upyogita ko samajhaayaa
 The books of Alexandre de Viladi and Jan Aq Halifax also disseminated the 'hindu numeral system'
 prarambh main iskaa virodh hua, kint pandrahavin shatabdi ke madhya tak europe ke sabhi deshon ne inako sweekaar kar liya tha
 Other European countries learned the Indian numeral system from Arabia
 chunki unhen yah ank pranali arab se mili thi isaliye unhone iskaa naam 'arabi ank pranali' rakh diya
 After having a good knowledge of history, it is now being called 'hindu-arabic numeral' or 'hindu numerology' or 'indian numerology'
 samay samay main tathaa desh desh main bhartiya ank pranali ke ankon ke sanket main anek parivartan huye
 In the end, these numbers became in the form of 0, 1, 2, 3, xxrep 4 
 and they got international recognition
 aadhunik ank evam ank pranali vastav main bhartiya hi hai
 Presently, these modern numerals are known as the "international form of Indian numerals"

 yahi kaam vidyut taron ko jahan tahaan le jaakar uthoa vidyutopkarnon se bhi kiya ja saktaa he, lekin aisa karne main jaraa si bhi asaavadhaanee se bijli kaa jhatka lagane se mrityu bhi ho sakati he
 There is no such fear in the use of ventilators

 In this type of air, the pressure of the air always remains on the underside of the piston, so to lift the load only the air above the piston has to be expelled and the air has to be pumped upwards to take off
 The piston also retains some space in the gap below the piston, so the burden is gradually lowered due to the low effective pressure
 upar kii hawa ko thodaa nikaal tathaa santulit kar boj ko bilkul sahi sahi jahaan chahen vahaan roak bhi sakate hai
 You can also carry it within your limits, including hanging it from the handcart on the gantry or over-the-top garages

 There is a plunger on the underside of the piston when it hits the base plate, then the table on the piston and the mold on it is jerked
 is prakaar piston ke baar baar uthne or girane se saanche main mitti thansakar baith jaati he
 Compressed air of 60 to 100 pounds per square inch of pressure is required to operate this device
 is yantra se 100 se lekar 160 jatke prati minute tak lagate hai
 To make the mold, put the frame on the board and put it in the frame, then put the mold box that fits right around it, fill the soil in it and the machine is made to sit by running the machine with the help of compressed air by vibrator
 phir saanche ke neeche laganevaale board ko saanche ke upar rakhkar, shikanjon se kas dete hai
 After opening the valve, compressed air enters the cylinder and operates the frame in such a way that the mold placed on it is returned to the correct position with the help of a spoon on the table, then the earlier tied screws are opened and The frame is also taken out of the mold by erecting the frame
 phir frem daahine haath kii taraf doosraa saanchaa banane ke liye waapas aa jaataa he

 The air is mounted near the mouth of the device with two air-cylinders and pistons which, while independent of each other, carry air from the same three-way valves and pressurize their pistons while driving them
 is valve ko chalaane ke liye ek hath liver or uski mooth ke saath hi laga ek angushth liver hota he
 Therefore, the hand lever is used to move and pull the tubes back in the middle of the cows, and the thumb lever is pressed on the chuck with the thumb lever

 rasayan vigyaan evam nirmaan me vidyut apghaton us prakriya ko kehete hai jiske dwaara kisi rasinic yogic main vidyut-dhara pravaahit karke uske rasinic bandhon ko ko todaa jaataa he
 For example, when electric current flows in water, water decomposes into hydrogen and oxygen, which is called electrical decomposition of water
 vidyut apghaton ke bahut se upyog hai
 The most important industrial and commercial use is to process ores and purify and separate the chemical element contained in them
 jab kisi oinic padaarth se jab vidyut dhara pravaahit karte hai to vidyutagron ke upar rasinic abhikriya hoti he or isse naye padaarth banate hai
 The role of the above components is as follows- vidyutagra, vidyut ke chaalak hone chaiye
 Electrode of metals, graphite and semiconductor materials are used extensively
 electrode ke padaarth kaa chunaav in baton se prabhavit hota he- a source of direct current, such as a battery or DC generator or rectifier, is required for the electrical decomposition of water
 pani ke vidyut apghaton se hydrogen or oxygen praapt hote hai
 The availability of hydrogen from water makes it important
 hydrogen bahut upyogi he
 It can be used as fuel in the internal combustion engines or it can be used in fuel cell to run electric motors
 vidyut apghaton ke kshetra main agrani kaary karne vaale kuch vyaktiyon ke naam - Newton's laws of motion are three physical laws that form the basis of sustainable mechanics
 ye niyam kisi vastu par lagane vaale bal or usase utpann us vastu kii gati ke bich sambandh bataate hai
 They have been expressed in many ways in three centuries
 newton ke gati ke teenon niyam, parmparik rup se, sankshep main nimnlikhit hai- Newton first compiled them in his book Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica
 newton ne anek sthanon par bhautik vastuon kii gati se sambandhit samasyaon kii vyakhya main inkaa prayog kiya tha
 In the third part of his book, Newton demonstrated that these three laws of motion and their universal law of gravitation are capable of interpreting Kepler's laws related to the motion of celestial bodies
 newton ke gati niyam sirf unhi vastuon par lagaaya jaataa he jinhen ham ek kan ke rup main maan sake
 Meaning that when measuring the speed of those objects, their size is ignored
 un vastuon ke pind ko ek bindu main kendrit man kar in niyamo ko lagaaya jaataa he
 This is done when the distances in the analysis are much larger than the objects
 isliye grahon ko ek kan maan kar unke kakshiya gati ko mapa ja saktaa he
 In its original form, the rules of these motions cannot be applied to fixed and deformable bodies
 1750 main leonard ular ne newton ke gati niyamo kaa vistaar kiya or ular ke gati niyamon kaa nirmaan kiya jinhen drudh or virupanshil pindo par bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 If an object is considered to be a combination of discrete particles, in which Newton's laws of motion can be applied separately, Euler's law of motion can be derived from Newton's law of motion
 newton ke gati niyam bhi kuch nirdesh tantron main hi lagu hote he jinhen jadtviya nirdesh tantra kaha jaataa he
 Many authors believe that the first rule defines the inertial instruction system and the second law is valid only with those instruction systems, for this reason the first rule cannot be called a special form of the second law
 par kuch pehle niyam ko duusare kaa parinaam maanate he
 The explicit concept of directive systems developed long after Newton died
 newtoni yantriki kii jagah ab oinstin ke vishesh aapekshikta ke siddhant ne le lee he par phir bhi iskaa istemaal prakaash kii gati se kam gati vaale pindon ke liye abhi bhi kiya jaataa he
 In Newton's original words hindi anuwaad "every object remains in its stagnation or uniform velocity until it is induced to change its state by some external factor
 " In other words, the object which is in resting state will remain in the resting state and the object which is in motion will remain in motion unless any external force is applied on it
 newton kaa pratham niyam padaarth ke ek prakritik gun jadtv ko paribhaashit karat he jo gati main badlaav kaa virodh karata he
 Therefore, the first law is also called the law of inertia
 yah niyam apratksh rup se jadtviya nirdesh tantra tathaa bal ko bhi paribhaashit karata he
 Because of this, this rule was put first by Newton
 is niyam kaa saral pramanikaran mushkil he kyonki gharshan or gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav ko zyaadaatar pind mahasoos karte hai
 Actually, Galileo described this observation before Newton
 newton ne anya shabdon main ise vyakt kiya
 In Newton's original words: hindi main anuwaad "A change in the momentum of an object is proportional to the impact on the object and occurs in the same direction
" "newton ke is niyam se adholikhit bindu vyupatrit kiye ja sakate he : Where f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} force, p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} momentum and t { \ displaystyle t} are time
 is sameekaran ke anusaar, jab kisi pind par koi bahya bal nahin he, to pind kaa samveg sthir rahata he
 When the mass of the body is constant, the equation can be written in a simpler form: jahaan m { \ displaystyle m} dravyaman he or a → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {a}}} twaran he
 That is, the acceleration of a body is proportional to the force applied
 aaveg dwitiya niyam se sambandhit he
 Impulse means a change in momentum
 arthath: Where i is the impulse
 aaveg takkaron ke vishleshan main bahut ahm he
 Let the mass of a body be m
 is par ek niyam bal f ko ∆tsamayanwarala ke liye lagane par veg main ∆v parivartit ho jaataa he
 Then Newton- atah kisi pind ko diya gaya aaveg, pind main utpann samveg- parivartan ke samaan hota he
 Therefore, the unit of impulse is the same as that of the impulse
 tritiy niyam kaa arth he ki kisi bal ke sangat ek or bal he jo uske samaan or vipareet he
 Newton used this rule to describe the law of momentum conservation, but actually momentum conservation is a more fundamental principle
 kai udahaaran hai jinamein samveg sangrakshit hota he lekin tritiy niyam maanya nahin he

 Prohibitionism is a philosophical theory that rejects one or more meaningful aspects of life
 aam taur par nishedhwaad ko sabase adhik astitv / maujhuuda nishedhwaad ke rup main prastut kiya he jo tark detaa he ki jivan kaa koi sarthak arth, kaaran yaa vaastavik mahatva nahin he
 The philanthropists who believe it assert that morality does not exist naturally, and that any kind of established moral values are artificially created
 nishedhwaad darshanawaad, aadhyatmavaad yaa siddhantvaad ke rup main bhi ho saktaa he, jiskaa arth he ki kuch swaroopon main gyaan sambhav nahin he yaa hamaare vishwaas ke vipareet he, is prakaar yatharth ke kuch pahalu astitv main nahin hote hai
 The term prohibitionism is sometimes combined with the lack of ideals in the general mood of despair caused by the perceived futility of existence, to explain that one can develop by understanding that there are no ideals, rules or laws 
 duusare andolanon ke saath bhavishyavaad or vidhwans ko tippaneekaron dwaara vibhinn samay par vibhinn sandarbhon main "shoonyavaadee " ke rup main pahachaanaa gaya he
 Prohibitionism is also a feature that has been attributed to many time periods, for example, Jean Baudrillard and others have considered the post-modern era to be a nihilistic era and data collected by some Christian theologians and religious gurus have Emphasized that the post-modern era and its many aspects represent the rejection of theism and that such a rejection of A

 haalanki shabd nishedhwaad ko pehali baar upanyaaskaar evan tarjanev ke upanyaas fadars and sans ke dwaara prasiddhi mili thi, isaki shuruyaat fredrick henrik jaikobi dwaara darshanik lekh ke rup main kii gayi thi
 Jacobi used this term for intellectualism and in particular to end the absurdity of Immanuel Kant's "critical" philosophy, according to which all forms of rationalism fall short of prohibitionism and should thus be avoided and Should be replaced with reverence and revelation of sorts
 For example, Brett W
 Davis writes, "the idea of introducing the philosophical development of prohibitionism is generally attributed to Friedrich Jacoby, who has criticized Fiche's idealism of turning into a famous character as prohibitionism
 jaikobi ke anusaar, fishe kii ahan kii purnataa ek prakaar ke manovad kaa badhaava detii he jo puri tarah se ishwar kii shreshthata ko nakaarti he
 a related concept is implicit beliefism

 Søren Kierkegaard laid the foundation of early prohibitionism, which he called leveling
 levlinga ek prakriya thi jiske anusaar vyaktitv ko us bindu tak dabaaya jaataa tha jahaan vyaktitv kii adwitiyata aprabhavi ho jaati thi or uske astitv main kuch bhi sarthak nahin rah jaataa tha
 Kierkegaard, a proponent of the philosophy of life, generally argued against leveling and its annihilationist influence, though he believed that "living in an age of equality would usually be extremely instructive to force people to face judgment alone
" George Kotkin states that in the nineteenth century Kierkegaard "standardized and equated faith, both spiritually and politically
" Dhi Qar was collectively person opposed Prwrattion culture of respect to the dominant opinion conformity to specific zero
 un dinon main patrikas tathaa bhrasht isai dharm levlinga ke saadhan the or 19 veen sadi ke europe ko "paravartak udasin" yug" banane ke jimmedaar the
 Kierkegaard argues that individuals who are able to come out of the leveling process are capable of it and this is a step in the right direction to "become a true personal personality"
 kyonki hamen levlinga se avashya baahar aana chahie, huebert drephus or jine rubin tark dete hai ki kiyarkeguard kii dilchaspee isamen he ki "badhate hue nirashaavadi daur main, ham kaise is bhaavana ko paa sakate he ki hamaara jivan arthpurna he"
 However it should be noted that in the context of prohibitionism Kierkegaard differs from modern definition in the sense that leveling for Kierkegaard represents the meaning, reason, values of life, whereas the modern definition suggests that someone from the very beginning of life There was no meaning, reason or significance
 nishedhwaad ko aksar german darshanik fredrick nitshe ke saath jod kar dekha jaataa he jinhone pashchimi sabhyataa main bade str par faile hue nishedhwaad kaa vistrut adhyayan kiya he
 Although it is commonly seen about Nietzsche's entire work, he used the term in various ways, positive and negative meanings, and additional meanings
 ek saamaanya tarika jisamen ve nishedhwaad kii vyakhya karte hai, "ham jo chaahate hai or duniya kii pratikriya ke bich vishmata ke kaaran utpann tanaav kii avasthaa"
 jab ham pate hai ki baahar kii duniya kaa uddeshypurna mahatva yaa arth nahin he jo ham chaahate hai, yaa lambey samay se maanate hai ki aisa hota he, ham swayan ko musiibat main pate hai
 Nietzsche claims that with Christianity declining and physical decline, prohibitionism is indeed a feature of the modern era, although he implies that prohibitionism has not yet risen to its fullest and is yet to succeed
 yadhyapi nitshe kii notebook main nishedhwaad kii samasya vishesh rup se vyakt kii gayi he, yah uske dwaara prakashit kitabon main baar baar kahi gayi he or usame bataai gayi kai samasyaon se najdiki rup se judi huyi he
 Nietzsche defined prohibitionism as emptying the world and specifically the meaning, purpose, comprehensible truth, or essential value of human existence
 is vyakhya kaa mul strot nitshe ke pariprekshwad yaa uski is dharna se upja he ki har kisi ke paas kisi chiz kaa gyaan avashya hota he, yah sambhaavna se ghira rahata he aure kabhi bhi ek tathy maatr nahin hota
 balki, kai vyakhyaaon ke madhyam se ham duniya ko samajhate hai or iskaa matlab nikaalte hai
 Without explanation we cannot move forward, but in reality it is something that we need
 duniya kii vyakhya kaa ek tarika naitikta he, ek moulik tarika jisame log duniya kaa matlab dhundte hai, visheshkar apane vichaar or kriyaaon ke sambandh main
 nitshe majboot yaa swasth naitikta main antar ko bataata he, arthath prashn puche jane vaale vyakti ko pataa he ki usne apane aap ko kamazor naitikta se banaaya he, jahaan vyakhya bahari rup se kii jaati he
 Instead of strength, morality gives us meaning, whether created or "incorporated", which helps us to live life
 yahi kaaran he ki nitshe "purna rup se bekaar" yaa "kuch nahin kaa arth he" ke rup main nishedhwaad khatarnaak he, yaa yahan tak ki "khataron kaa khatra" he
 With the help of assessment, people sustain and face life's dangers, pain and difficulties
 sabhi arthon or mulyon kaa purna rup se vinaash aatmahatya yaa bade paimaane par hatya ke samaan hoga
 Nietzsche discusses in detail the context of the problem of prohibitionism in one of the important topics in his work, the chapter on 'european prohibitionism' in his notebook on Christianity
 yahan vah kahata he ki isai naitik siddhant logon ko vaastavik mulya, bhagwaan main vishwaas bataata he) or uddeshyaatmak gyaan ke liye ek aadhaar pradaan karata he
 In this sense, in the creation of a world where objective knowledge is possible, Christianity acts as an exterminator for the hopeless stems from meaninglessness, the fundamental form of prohibitionism
 haalanki, yah vastav main isai siddhant kii satyavadita kaa tatv he arthath khud kaa vinaash : satya ke prati apane abhiyaan main, isai dharm antat khud ko ek aise nirmaan ke rup main paata he, jo khud ke vighatan kii ore ja rahaa he
 That is why Nietzsche has said that we have gone beyond Christianity "not because we live far away from it, but because we are very close to it
 " is tarah, isai dharm kaa swayambhu vighatan nishedhwaad ke ek or praaroop kaa nirmaan karata he
 Because Christianity was an interpretation that placed itself in a state of interpretation, Nietzsche states that this disintegration leads to the destruction of all meanings beyond skepticism
 stanley rosen nishedhwaad ke bare main nitshe kii avadharana ko us arthhinata kii sthiti se jaanate hai, jahaan "har chiz ke liye anumati he"
 unke anusaar, ucch aadhyatmik mulyon ke khone ke kaaran, jo duniya yaa maanav maatr vichaaron ke aadhaar kii vaastaviktaa ke vipareet astitv main hai, is vichaar ko janm dete hai ki isi kaaran sabhi maanav vichaar arthhin hai
 Denial of idealism results in the emergence of prohibitionism, because similarly only noble ideals will live up to the previous standards that nihilists still hold to be due to inherent entanglement
 duniya kaa moolyankan karne ke strot ke rup main isaiyat kii aakshamata nitshe kii ' da ge science ' main pagal vyakti kii prasiddh kahawat ke rup main parilakshith hoti he
 The death of God, especially the narrative that "we killed him", is in a way similar to the self-ground dissolution of Christian doctrine: the evolution of science, for which Nietzsche showed that man is the product of evolution, the stars of the earth
 There is no special place in it and history is not progressive, Christian belief of God as the basis of morality cannot last long
 is arth ko khone kii pratikriya ke ek rup ko nitshe 'niskriy nishedhwaad ' kahata he, jo uske anusaar shopenhoir ke nirashaavadi darshan main he
 Schopenhauer's theory, also called Nietzsche Western Buddhism, advocates separation from desires and needs to avoid suffering
 nitshe is kathor drushtikon ko "kuch na hone kii ichha" ke rup main dekhtaa he jahaan jivan swayan se dur hone lagata he, chunki duniya main kisi bhi chiz kaa mulya dikhaai nahin detaa
 duniya ke sabhi mulyon ko mitaanaa shoonyavaadee kii visheshta he, haalanki is main, shoonyavaadee anuchit prathit hota he
 Nietzsche has a complex relationship with the problem of prohibitionism
 vah ek gahare vyaktitv ke rup main nishedhwaad kii samasya ko yah kehete hue dekhtaa he ki aadhunik duniya kii yah samasya ek aisi samasya he jo usame "sachet ho" gayi he
 Furthermore, he emphasizes the danger of prohibitionism and the possibilities it offers, as seen in his statement "I admire, i do not despise the arrival
 i believe it to be one of the greatest of crises" There is one, one moment, which is a deep self-reflection of humanity
 chaahe manushya is se ubar jaae, chaahe vah is sankat par niyantran kar le, yah uski takat par nirbhar karata he!" nitshe ke mutabik, nishedhwaad ko keval tabhi haraaya ja saktaa he jab samskruti kaa ek sachcha aadhaar ho jis par yah fale foole
 unhone aisa jaldi hone kii kaamana kii taaki taaki ve ise jaldi se hataa saken
 He said that at least the disintegration of Christianity is likely to lead to the rise of another type of nihilist, one that does not stop after the destruction of all values and meanings and becomes subject to negativity
 is vaikalpik, yaa duusare shabdon main 'sakriy' nishedhwaad kuch naye nirmaan kii jameen ko nasht kar detaa he
 This type of prohibitionism has been called a "sign of power" by Nietzsche, to start new at will and to root out old values and establish his own beliefs and interpretations, in contrast to passive prohibitionism that disintegrates old values
 Abandons oneself
 in mulyon kaa apni icchaanusaar vinaash tathaa naye arth bana kar nishedhwaad kii sthiti se baahar aana, is sakriy nishedhwaad ko nitshe kii ek or paribhaasha "mukt aatma" yaa daj spoke zarathustra va da antikrist main ubermensh kaha ja saktaa he, ek majboot vyakti he jo swayan apane mulya nirdhaarit karata he or apana jivan aise jeeta he mano yah ek kala ho
 Many modernist thinkers who have investigated the problem of prohibitionism raised by Nietzsche were influenced by Martin Heidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche
 haal hi main aisa hua he ki nitshe dwaara nishedhwaad ke shodh par hidagar kaa prabhaav feekaa hua he
 In the early 1930s, Heidegger lectured on Nietzsche's ideas
 nitshe ke nishedhwaad vishay main yogadan ko dekhte hue, hidagar dwaara nitshe kii prabhaavshaalee vyakhya nishedhwaad shabd ke aitihaasik vikaas main mahatvapurn he
 Heidegger's way of researching and teaching about Nietzsche is entirely his own
 vah nitshe ko nitshe ke rup main pesh karne kii vishesh koshish nahin karata
 iske bajaay vah nitshe ke vichaaron ko swayan apni darshanik pranali astitv, samay or maujuudagi main samahit karne kii koshish karata he
 In his Prohibitionism as Determined by the History of Being, Heidegger tries to understand Nietzsche's prohibitionism in a manner as if trying to win by devaluing the highest values of the time
 The principle of this devaluation, according to Heidegger, is a desire for power
 shakti kii ichha prayek shuruuaati mulyon ke moolyankan kaa siddhant bhi he
 How does this devaluation happen and why is it nihilistic? One of Heidegger's main criticisms on philosophy is that philosophy, and in particular, spiritualism, has forgotten to make a distinction between existence and the notion of existence
 hidagar ke anusaar, pashchimi vichaaron ke itihaas ko aadhyatmavaad ke itihaas ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 And because spiritualism has forgotten to ask about the notion of existence
 yah nitshe ke aadhyatmavaad kii nishedhwaad ke upar vijay nahin he apitu isaki sateekta he
 In his explanation of Nietzsche, Heidegger has been influenced by Ernst Junger
 hidagar ke nitshe par vyakhyanon main janger ke kai sandarbh dekhe ja sakate hai
 For example, in a letter written to the Rector of Freiburg University on 4 November 1945, influenced by Junger, Heidegger tries to interpret the notion of "god is dead" as "the truth of the will to power" 
 hidagar janger dwaara nitshe ke tisare shashan ke dauraan atyadhik jeev vigyaan yaa maanav shaastra padhane ke khilaaf bachaav karne kii bhi prashansa karata he
 Many important modern thinkers were influenced by Heidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche
 jiani vatimo nitshe or hidagar ke bich europea vichaaron main paraspar andolan kii ore sanket dete hai
 During the 1960s, a Nietzsche-based 'renaissance' began, culminating with the work of Mezzino Montinari and Giorgio Coli
 unhonen nitshe dwaara ekatrit kaamon kaa nayaa or purna sangrah taiyaar kiya, jisase shodharthiyon ke anusandhan ke liye nitshe tak pahunch aasaan ho gayi
 Waitimo explains that with this new version of Collie and Montinari, Heidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche began to take shape in a critical response
 Like other contemporary French and Italian philosophers, Vetimo does not want to depend on Heidegger to understand Nietzsche, or only partially
 duusari taraf, vatimo ke anusaar hidagar ke iraade unka anusaran karne ke liye paryaapt rup se pramanik hai
 The philosophers whom Vetimo exemplifies this mutual ideology are the French philosophers Deleuze, Foucault, and Deridou ॰ among the Italian philosophers of the same ideology, Cassieri, Severino, and himself
 havermas, lotard or rorty bhi aise darshanik hai jo hidagar dwaara nitshe kii vyakhya se prabhavit hai
 The idea of post-modernism and post-structuralism questions the basis on which the truth of Western civilization rests: absolute knowledge and meaning, 'decentralization' of literary works, accumulation of positive knowledge, historical development, and some ideals and Humanism and the practice of enlightenment
 Jack Derrida, whose destruction is generally rated as the most nihilistic, has never followed the nihilist ideology itself, as some claim
 dairydian vinashwadi yah tark dete hai ki is drushtikon se granthon ko, vyakti vishesh yaa sansthaaon ko pratibandhit sach ko bolne se chhot milti he or is prakaar kaa vinaash astitv ke anya tareekon kii sambhaavnaaon ke dwaar kholta he
 Gayatri Chakravarti Spivak, for example, uses destruction to formulate policies that expose Western researchers to slavery and the philosophical voice outside the test of Western texts
 khud darida ne 'dusron ke liye jimmedaari' ke aadhaar par apane liye darshan banaai, is prakaar vinaash ko keval satya ko asweekaar karne ke rup main nahin dekha ja saktaa, apitu sach ko jaanane kii hamaari kshamta ko asweekaar karne ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he 
 Lyotard argues that, instead of relying on an objective truth or method to substantiate their claims, philosophers legitimize their truth by the story of the world, which is indistinguishable from the age and system of related stories Is and is called Meta Katha by Lyotard
 iske baad ve aadhuniktaavaadi sthiti ko meta katha kii tathaa meta katha dwaara vaidhata kii prakriya, donon kii asweekruti ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai
 "in lieu of meta-narrative we have created a new linguistic game to justify our claims based on changing relationships and unstable truths, none of them have the privilege of saying something to each other on the ultimate truth"
 
 This concept and meaning of the impermanence of truth leads to the direction of negativism, although leotards prevent the latter from joining
 postmodern sidghantkaar jin boudryllard ne aadhuniktawaad se baad ke drushtikon se nishedhwaad par sankshep main simulakaara tathaa simulation main likhaa he
 He stuck to the themes of real-world interpretations as hypocrites that made this the real world
 arth kaa upyog boudryllard kii nishedhwaad par charchaa kaa ek mahatvapurn vishay tha: Prohibitionism has many definitions and was therefore used to describe independent debatable philosophical positions
 naitik shoonyavad jise athical shoonyavad ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, ek naitikta se pare drushtikon he ki kisi uddeshyaatmak sachai main naitikta nahin basati, isliye koi bhi kaary duusare se behatar nahin he
 For example, a moral nihilist would say that killing someone, whatever the cause, is not inherently right or wrong
 kuch shoonyavaadee tark dete hai ki sabhi main koi naitikta nahin he, lekin agar he, to yah maanav dwaara nirmit he or is tarah se kritrim nirmaan he, jisame koi vishesh athwa sabhi arth vibhinn sambhav parinaamon se sambandhit hai
 As an example, if someone kills someone, such a nihilist can argue that killing is not inherently evil, independently of our moral beliefs, simply because of the manner in which morality Is constructed as a fundamental contradiction of something, bad work is rated negatively in the expectation of good work: as a result, killing the person was bad work
 It did not let the person survive, which was rated arbitrarily positive
 is tarah se naitik shoonyavaadee sochate hai ki sabhi naitik daawey jhuthe hai
 Existential nihilism is a belief that life has no real meaning or value
 is par keval vaigyanik vishleshanon dwaara yah dikhaa kar pratibandh lagaaya ja saktaa he ki keval bhautik kanoonon ne hi hamaare astitv ke liye yogadan diya he
 In the context of the universe, a human being or even the entire human species without purpose has no significance and is unlikely to change in the totality of existence
 saadhaaran rup se, is sambandh main shoonyavaadiyon kaa maananaa he ki jivan kaa ekmaatr uddeshy ise jite rahanaa he
 Prohibitionism can be seen as the extremity of skepticism as a knowledge-related scripture where all kinds of knowledge are rejected
 aadhyatmik nishedhwaad ek darshanik siddhant he ki aisa ho saktaa he ki sab kuch na ho arthath aisi sambhav duniya he jisame koi vastu na ho, yaa ho saktaa he ki kam se kam koi thos vastu na ho, taaki yadi prayek sambhav duniya main ek prakaar kii vasteen hon, to uname se kam se kam ek aisi hoti he jisame keval tatv ke rup main vasteen hoti hai
 An extreme form of spiritual prohibitionism is usually defined as the belief that existence itself has no value
 is prakaar ke kathan kii vyakhya karne kaa ek dhang he : 'astitv' ko 'gaiyr maujuudagi se' alag pahchaanana asambhav he kyonki isamen koi vastu ke gun nahin hai or is tarah yah ek vaastaviktaa he ki ek sthiti donon ke bich ke kram ko prabhavit kar sakati he
 If one cannot think of negating existence, then the concept of existence has no meaning, or in other words, does not ‘exist’ in any meaningful way
 yahan 'arth' kaa matlab is tark ke liye kiya gaya he ki astitv kii ucch str par koi vaastaviktaa nahin he jo ki nishchit rup se iskaa aavashyak tathaa paribhaashit gun he, astitv kaa swayan arth he kuch nahin
 yahan yah tark diya ja saktaa he ki is vishwaas ko yadi gyaan se sambandhit shaastra se jod kar dekha jaae, to vyakti keval nishedhwaad ke chakravyuuh main ghir kar rah jayega jisame kuch bhi vaastavik yaa sach nahin ho saktaa kyonki aise mulya maujuud nahin hai
 This situation can be found in the theory that the soul itself is the object of true knowledge, however, in this view the self-realist confirms himself while the nihilist denies the existence of himself
 yah donon sthitiyaan yatharthwaad virodh kaa rup hai
 However, to say that existence and truth do not exist is to express generally about existence and truth
 miriological nishedhwaad ek sthiti he jiske anusaar kisi bhi vastu kaa sahi hisson ke saath vajood nahin he or keval bina kisi hisson ke keval buniyadi dhaanche hote hai) or is prakaar ham jis hisson se bhari hui duniya ko dekhte athwa uskaa anubhav karte hai, manushya kii samaj ke parinamswaroop he 
 a branch of prohibitionism, political negativism, which follows the characteristic of nihilism as rejecting irrational or unproven claims, requires a basic social and political structure such as government, family or law and law
 In the 19th-century nihilist movement, Russia supported a similar principle
 thomas hibs, jo boston college ke professor or darshan shastri hai, ne suzav diya he ki sinfield tivi sho main nishedhwaad kii abhivyakti he
 The basis of the fact is that it is a "show" about "nothing"
 episod ke adhikansh hisse main zaraa si baat par jor diya gaya he
 The scenes presented at Sinfield are certainly similar to the prohibitionism philosophy, the idea that life is meaningless and that it creates an absurd feeling, causing sarcastic humor in the show
 dada shabd kaa prayog sabase pehle 1916 main triston dzaara dwaara kiya gaya
 An ideology, which lasted from about 1916 to 1922, originated during World War I, an event that influenced artists
 dada vichaardhaara zurich switzraland main shuru huyi - voltaire cafe main - jise "niederdörfli" yaa "niederdorf" ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The Dadaists claimed that Dada was not an art ideology, but rather an anti-art ideology, in which sometimes found objects like stolen poetry are used
 "kala virdohi" aandolan ko yuddh ke pashchaat ke khalipan se utpann hua mana jaataa he
 This tendency towards devaluation of art led many to claim that Dada was essentially a nihilistic movement
 yah dekhte hue ki dada ne apane utpaadon kii vyakhya ke liye apane swayan ke arth banaaye, ise adhikansh anya samakaleen kala abhivyaktiyon ke saath vargeekrut karnaa mushkil he
 Therefore, due to ambiguity it is classified, at times, as a nihilistic modus vivendi
