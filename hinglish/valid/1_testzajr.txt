 "melodrama" was an important element in the performance of Parsi theater and the dialogue was played in a very dramatic way
 unhone kaha ki aaj bhi filmon ke abhinay main parsi naatak ke tatv dikhaai dete hai
 For 80 years, the Parsi theater and its various forms kept their coinage in the entertainment sector

 The Parsi theater has four major features
 pehla, pardon kaa nayab prayog
 Different scenes are used for every scene on the stage to bring depth and reliability to the scenes
 aajkal filmon main alag alag lokation dikhaae jate hai
 In Parsi theater, this work is done through curtains
 isliye parsi rangamanch kii manch sajja kaa vidhaan bada hi jatil hota he
 The second feature is the use of music, dance and singing in them

 For this reason, Indian films began to diverge from Western films

 The colors and embellishments are taken care of in the clothes that the actors wear on the Parsi colormatch
 chunki darshak bahut peeche tak baithe hoten hai isliye unako dhyaan main chhakhte hue vastron or paatro ke alankaran main rangon kii bahutyaat hoti he
 The fourth major feature of the Parsi Theater is the lengthy dialogues
 parsi naatakon ke samvaad oonchi aawaaj main bole jate hai isliye sanvaadon main atinaatakeeyata bhi rahati he
 Singing was an important element in Parsi theater and the actors used to sing to express their deep feelings
 parsi theatre main ek abhinayta ke liye ek acha gayak hona behatar mana jaataa tha kyonki aadhi kahani gaanon main hi chalati thi
 The effect of Parsi theater is that songs are used extensively in our Hindi films today
 gaanon ke bagaiyr aaj bhartiya darshak film ko adhuraa maanate hai
 Our modern Hindi films have started appearing influenced by the realism of the West, but even today it is maintaining the tradition of Parsi theater by singing and speaking

 Typography was a special type of business until the advent of the digital age

 The choice of font is the first stage of typography lessons - story written in prose, writing separate from the story, editorial, academic, religious, scientific, spiritual and professional writing
 The right typeface and font all have their own special characteristics and needs

 Contemporary books are probably set with state-of-the-art serif "text roman" or "book roman" and their design values are indicative of present-day design art that Nicholas Jansen, Francesco Griffo and Clouds are based to a large extent on traditional models such as Garamond

 Typography is corrected by morphology and linguistics, word structure, word frequency, morphology, phonetic composition and linguistic syntax
 typography ek vishisht saanskrithik chalan ke saath bhi judaa hua he
 For example, it is customary to give a non-breaking space before a punctuation or semicolon in a French sentence, whereas in English it is not
 typography main pej par syaahi kii puri saghanta rang hi hota he, jise mukhya rup se tip phase or aakaar ke dwaara nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he, jo ki mahatvapurn he, lekin verde spacing or margin kii gaharaai dwaara bhi iskaa nirdhaaran hota he
 The text layout, tone or color of the set matter, and the text's interaction with the page's white space and other graphic elements reflect the "feel" and "resonance" of the content
 print media ke saath hi typographer binding margin, kaagaj ke chunaav tathaa mudran kii vidhi ke saath bhi jude rahete hai
 Likability is the case of a typeface designer to ensure that each character or glyph is clean and tidy with all other characters in the font
 Convenience is also somewhat related to the typographer choosing the typeface of the correct and clean design for intended use at the fixed size
 a well-known example of design, the brush script contains a lot of unreadable characters, since many of those characters can easily be misread if they look different from the textual context
 pathneeyata mukhya rup se typographer yaa soochna diziner se judi hui he
 This is the intended result of the entire process of its presentation to explain the textual content as clearly as possible
 optinal inter letters, inter-verde tathaa vishesh rup se inter-line spacing ke saath pej par sahi line length or sthiti kaa judaav, saavdhaan sampadakeey "chanking" or sheershak, pholio tathaa sambandhit link kii text sanrachana ke vikalp ke dwaara ek pathak ko aasaani se jaankaree ke aasapaas jane main madad kii ja sakati he
 One of the clearest distinctions between these two concepts was presented by Walter Tracy in his Letters of Credit
 


 'ek mudran ke do pahalu' 


 'apni prabhaavashiltaa main moulikta' 


 hai
 Because the common meaning of "readable" is "readable", there are still some people, some of whom are also commercially involved with typography, who think that "readability" is a term that refers to the effectiveness of the type and Needs debate
 lekin spashtataa or pathneeyata alag-alag hai, haalanki ye tip kii pahalu se sambandhit hai
 It is well known that these two words can help in analyzing the feature and function of type in a much narrower sense than the word readability alone
 


 typography main hamen spashtataa or aasaani se pahchaan yogya hone kii gunvattta kaa matlab samajhane ke liye


suvachyata kii paribhaasha dene kii jarurat he - isliye, udaaran ke liye, ham kah sakate hai ki puraane itelic style ke chote aakaar main lower cese h spasht nahin hota kyonki iskaa muda hua pair b kii tarah dikhaai padataa he; yaa vargeekrut vigyaapan main ek ank 3 bahut had tak 8 ke samaan he
 


 The portability of display sizes is serious, a character that causes uncertainty at 8 points will become apparent at 24 points
 dhyaan dene kii baat he ki uparyukt siddhant jaruri prakaash main upyukt reeding duuri par 20 / 20 drushti vaale logon ke saath lagu hota he
 The similarity of an optician chart to test for freedom of meaning and visual acuity is useful to indicate the scope of the concept of clarity
 'typography main 


 agar ek akhbaar yaa patrika yaa ek kitaab ke pannon ke stambhon ko tanaav yaa kathinaayee ke bina kai minuton tak padhaa ja saktaa he, to ham kah sakate hai ki tip kii pathneeyata acchhee he
 This indicates the quality of visual comfort - this is an important requirement in the long detailed understanding of the text, but on the contrary, it is not as important for things like telephone directories or airplane time schedules, where the reader can see it consistently
 Do not read, but look for information about a small thing
 drishy prabhaav ke donon pahaluon main antar text setting ke liye sans-cerriff kii upyuktata ke ek parichit tark dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Characters of a typical sans-serif face can make complete sense among themselves, but no one can think of setting a famous novel as it has little readability
 suvachyata 'pratyaksh gyaan se sambandhit he' or pathneeyata 'samaj ko darshata he'
 typographer kaa uddeshy donon main utkrushtataa praapt karnaa hota he
 "the chosen typeface must be clear
 Meaning, it must be read without effort
 Sometimes clarity is just a matter of type size
 lekin bahut had tak aksar, yah tiperphes dizin kaa maamla he
 Generally, typefaces that are close to basic letterfarms are more pronounced than typefaces that are dense, diffuse, compacted, or detached
 haalanki, ek spasht tiperphes bhi kamjor setting or kram sthaan ke chalate apthaneey ho saktaa he, thik usee tarah spasht tiperphes achche dizin ke dwaara adhik pathneey banaae ja sakate hai
 Studies of both clarity and readability have examined a large range of other elements, including type size and design
 udhaaharan ke liye, cerriff banaam sans cerriff tip, itelic tip banaam roman tip, line lenth, line spacing, color contrast, daayen kinare kaa dizin banaam daayan vistaar kii tulana karnaa, tathaa yah ki kya text haifan yukt he
 Allegorical research was published in the later days of the nineteenth century
 yadhyapi vahaan aksar samanthaayen or kai vishyon par sahmati he, lekin duusare aksar sangharsh or raay kii vibhinnata ke maarmik kshetron ko saamne laate hai
 For example, according to Alex Pool, no one has given a final answer as to which font, serifed or sans serif provides the most clarity
 anya vishyon jaise justifoid banaam anjustifoid, haifan kaa prayog, padhane main kathinaayee mahasoos karne vaale logon ke liye upyukt phant jaise ki dislexia par vivaad jari he
 Web sites such as hgredbes
com, Bain Comic Sans, Britain's National Literacy Trust, and Mark Simonson Studios have raised controversies on the above topics and many more, and many of them present a thorough and well-organized position

 The game of chicken, also known as the hawk game or the snow mound, is a kind of conflict between two opponents in game theory
 isamen donon ke bich main ek aisi pratiyogita shuru ho jaati he jisamen donon main se koi bhi peeche nahin hatana chahta lekin kisi ke bhi na hatane par donon ko baari haani hoti he
 In this, the name of 'murgi' has come from the game in which two drivers speed their respective vehicles towards each other
 donon main se ek ko haar maanakar alag mudana hoga, varanaa takaraav main donon kii maut bhi ho sakati he
 But whichever is removed first will be considered as 'chickens', ie Buzdil or cowards
 yah 'muri kaa khel' vaala naam raajnneeti or arthshaastra main adhik prayog hota he
 For example, in the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962, tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States continued to escalate and a nuclear holocaust could occur if there was no retreat, but the Soviet Union pulled back

 In this game, there is often a dilemma in the mind of both the players
 agar lage ki doosraa darkar hat jayega to date rahanaa chahie
 The loss of the one who is removed also includes insulting the other, because the other one seems brave while the one who withdraws is a coward
 lekin agar donon yahi sochakar ant tak date rahen to donon kaa hi baari nuksaan ho saktaa he

 The Shiromani Akali Dal is a major regional political party in Punjab, India
 prakaash singh badal ke netritv sukhbir singh badal iske vartmaan adhyaksh hai
 Giving a political voice to Sikhs in the world is the main objective of this party
 taraazoo iskaa chunaav chihn he
 Akali Dal akali dal kaa gathan disambar 1920 ko 14 shiromani gurudwara prabandhak cameti, sikh dharmik sharir ke ek kaary bal ke rup main kiya gaya tha
 The Akali Dal considers itself the principal representative of the Sikhs
 sardaar sarmukh singh chubbal ekikrut akali dal ke pehle adhyaksh the, lekin isane master tara singh ke netritv main adhik lokapriyata praapt kii
 Master Tara Singh was a staunch Sikh leader
 unhone angrej sarkaar kii sahaayta se sikhpanth ko brihat hindu samaaj se pruthak karne ke sardaar ujjvalasinh majithia ke prayaas main har sambhav yoga diya
 The party started the Punjabi Suba movement, led by Sant Fateh Singh, demanding a state with a majority of Punjabis from undivided eastern Punjab
 sarkaar ko prasann karne ke liye sena main adhikadhik sikhon ko bhartee hone ke liye prerit kiya
 Due to them, Sikhs were also given separate communal representation like Muslims in India Act 1919
 mahayuddh ke baad master ji ne sikh raajnneeti ko congress ke saath sambhddha kiya or sikh gurudwaron or dharmik sthalon kaa prabandh hindu mathadhishon or hindu pujaariyon ke haath se chhinakar unpar adhikaar kar liya
 This led to an unprecedented increase in the strength of the Akali Dal
 master tarasingh shiromani gurudwara prabandh cameti ke pratham mahaamantri chune gaye
 The placement of the glands came into his hands
 inaki sahaayta se akaliyon kaa antkapurna prabhaav sampurna punjab main chaa gaya
 Master Tara Singh later was elected President of the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee several times
 master tarasingh ne san 1921 ke savinay avagya andolan main sakriy rup se bhaag liya, par san 1928 kii bhartiya sudhaaron sambandhi neh degree cameti kii report kaa is aadhaar par virodh kiya ki usamen punjab vidhansabha main sikhon ko 30 pratishat pratinidhitiv nahin diya gaya tha
 Then the Akali Dal severed its ties with the Congress
 1930 main purna swarajya kaa sangram prarambh hone par master tarasingh tatasth rahe or inke dal ne dwitiya mahayuddh main angrejon kii sahaayta kii
 The "pathik" party organized by Master Tara Singh in 1946's General Assembly won 20 out of the 33 seats assigned to the Sikhs in the assembly of the united Punjab
 master ji ne sikhistan kii sthapana ke apane lakshya kii purti ke liye jinna se samjhauta kiya
 Assisted him in forming the League's cabinet in Punjab and finding the basis for the creation of Pakistan
 lekin raajnneeti ke chatur khilaadi jinna se bhi unhen niraashaa hi haath lagi
 After the announcement of partition of India, riots started in Amritsar under Master Tara Singh's plan to take advantage of the opportunity, but this attempt of Master Ji also failed
 master ji ne samvidhanparishad main sikhon ke sampradayik pratinidhitiv ko kaayam rakhane, bhashasuchi main gurumukhi lipi main punjab ko sthaan dene tathaa sikhon ko harijanon kii bhanti vishesh suvidhaayen dene par bal diya or sardaar patel se aashwaasan praapt karne main safal hue
 Thus the Constitutional Council also sealed the separate existence of Sikh sect and by providing special facilities to the Sikhs, opened the way for quick spread of Sikh sect by conversion of poor and Dalit Hindus
 tarasingh ise sikh rajya kii sthapana kaa aadhaar maanate the
 At the time of the election agreement with the Congress in the 1952 General Election, he was successful in making the decision of the creation of a separate Punjabi speaking state and the establishment of a Punjabi University by the Congress Working Committee

 In those days, the movement of independent Punjab under the leadership of Master Tara Singh was going on in full swing
 praant main ek prakaar kii araajaktaa machi hui thi
 Kairo faced the movement with his strong personality and political foresight, and his diplomacy succeeded in creating a split between the movement's main pillars, Master Tara Singh and Sant Fatah Singh, and the movement became disjointed
 kaid ho chuke tara singh ne apane sthaan par pradarshan kaa netritv karne ke liye apane anyatam sahyog sant fatehsingh ko manonith kiya
 The saint later started an indefinite fast for the Punjabi state in the absence of Master ji, to finish it, Master Tara Singh forced Sant Fatehsinh after his release from imprisonment and in response became the wrath of the Sikh community
 apni pratishtha ko banaae rakhane ke liye unhone swayan aamaran anshan prarambh kar diya, jise unhone kendriya sarkaar ke aashwaasan par hi tyaagaa
 The government invited the saint in place of the master ji
 ghatnakramon ne ab tak master ji ke netritv ko prabhaavaheen or sant ko vikhyath bana diya tha
 He got entangled at every turn and Sant Ji's popularity grew in the same proportion
 sardaar pratapsingh ke raajnneetik kaushal ne sikh raajnneetik shakti ke akshay strot shiromani gurudwara prabandh cameti se bhi master ko nishkasit karne main sant ko safal banaaya
 Master ji was defeated by Sant ji
 unke 45 varsh puraane netritv kaa ant ho gaya; yah unki raajnneetik mrityu thi
 In 1962, his party got only three seats in the assembly
 yadhyapi 1966 main hue punjab vibhaajan kii purvapithika taiyaar karne kaa sampurna shrey master tarasingh ko hi he
 In 1966, the present Punjab was formed
 tab akali dal nae punjab main satta main aayaa tha, lekin vahaan kii shuruaati sarkarein party ke bheetar aantarik sangharsh or satta sangharsh ke kaaran lambey samay tak satta main nahin raheen
 Later, the party was strengthened and the party governments were able to complete their term
 vartmaan raajnneetik sthiti In 2012, the Punjab government was formed by the Akali Dal in partnership with its regional and national ally Bharatiya Janata Party
 isamen sarkaar ke antargat punjab vidhansabha main iske 59 sadsy hai or 12 bhartiya janata party ke
 As such, it is a joint majority government
 2012 ke chunaavon main akali dal ko purna bahumat praapt hua
 Party mentor and former president Prakash Singh Badal became the Chief Minister of Punjab and party president Sukhbir Singh Badal became the Deputy Chief Minister
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main party ne loksabhaa main 4 sthanon par vijay praapt kii
 The main political rival of the Akali Dal in Punjab is the Indian National Congress

 St
 Vincent and the Grenadines is theoretically a monarchy, and the ruler of St
 Vincent and the Grenadines is its head of state, although the ruler exercises all the constitutional powers of the Governor, as his representative, the governor-general of St
 Vincent and the Grenadines 
 adhirat yadi stri ho to unhen " saint vincent or grenadins kii rani" ke naam he sambodhit kiya jaataa he, or ek purush adhirat ko " saint vincent or grenadins ke raja ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 The historical background of the monarchy in St
 Vincent and the Grenadines dates back to British colonialism, when Britain expanded its empire in the 18th century and established colonies in various corners of the world

 in anek rashtron ke chinhatmak samanaantar pramukh hone ke naate, british ekarat swayan ko rashtramandal ke pramukh ke kitaab se bhi nawazte hai
 Although the ruler is usually referred to as the British ruler, in principle, all nations have equal authority over the sovereign, and all countries of the Commonwealth are completely independent and autonomous
 samprabhu ke parivaar ke sabase kareebi sadasyon ke samooh ko kahajata he
 However, there is no firm rule or legislation that regulates which individuals should be placed in this particular group, nor is there any legislation that defines the royalty in detail
 aam taur par britain ke un vyaktiyon ko jinpar hiz / har magesti yaa hiz / har royal hyness kaa sambodhan rakhte hai, ko aam taur par rajpariwaar kaa sadsy mana jaataa he
 Only the sovereign has constitutional duties and positions in the royal family

 The relationship between Commonwealth territories is such that any bidding that disciplines succession requires the unanimous approval of all countries

 Succession over the throne is disciplined by various historical constitutions

 However, the government bears the charge of the expenses incurred during the visit of the sovereign or royal family
 iske alaava, governor-governor-general ke aadhikarik kharche bhi sarkaar uthaati he
 The ruling queen / king is theoretically vested with the authority of a constitutional ruler, but conventionally all these powers are bound to be exercised only by the Maharajyapala, being the representative of the ruler as per the specifications of Parliament and Government
 atah anya rashtramandal prajabhumiyon ke samaan hi, yah ek sansadeey samrajyata he
 As a parliamentary ruler, all constitutional rights of the ruler are limited to fair and non-political functions, which are in principle the rights of the ruler, but in reality they are exercised only by the governor-general
