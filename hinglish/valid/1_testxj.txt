 The quality improvement process of the past six decades, based on the work of promoters of Six Sigma, Schuheart, Deming, Juran, Ishikawa, Taguchi and others, has been heavily influenced by quality control, TQM and zero defects
 apane purvavartiyon kii bhaanti sicks sigma nishchaypurvak kahata he ki -- Features that differentiate Six Sigma from previous quality improvement innovations include - shabd "sicks sigma", prakriya kshamta adhyayan ke rup main vidit sankhyikee ke ek kshetra se vyutpann he

 In the late 1990s, two-thirds of the Fortune 500 institutions started the Six Sigma initiative with the aim of reducing their costs and improving quality
 haal ke varshon main, sicks sigma ko kabhi-kabhi anutpaadak vinirmaan ke saath joda jaataa rahaa he, taaki anutpaadak sicks sigma naamak prakriya pratifalit ho sake
 Sigma is used to represent the standard deviation of a statistical population
 shabd "sicks sigma prakriya" is dharna se utpann hua he ki yadi kisi ke paas nirmaan-ausat or nikatatam vinirdisht seemaa ke bich chah maanak vichlan hai, to vyaavhaarik rup se aisa koi mad nahin hoga jo vinirdeshon ke anukool naa ho
 yah prakriya sakshmata adhyayan main prayukt gananaa paddati par aadhaarit he
 In a competence study, the number of these standard deviations between the process average and the nearest specified range is given in sigma units
 jaise hi prakriya maanak vichlan upar jaae, yaa prakriya ausat gunjaaish ke centre se dur jaae, sigma sankhya ko kam karte hue or vinirdesh ke baahar madon kii sambhaavnaaon ko badhaate hue, bahut kam maanak vichlan ausat or nikatatam vinirdisht seemaa ke bich main baithenge
 Experience says that processes generally do not perform as well in the long run as they do in a short time
 parinamswaroop, praarambhik alpavadhi-adhyayan kii tulana main, prakriya ausat or nikatatam vinirdesan seemaa ke bich thik baithne vaali sigmaon kii sankhya main samay ke saath giravat kii sambhaavna he
 In order to show a clear increase in process variation over time, a 1
5 sigma shift is introduced into the calculation on an experimental basis
 is vichaar ke anusaar, prakriya, jo alpavadhi adhyayan ke dauraan, prakriya ausat or nikatatam vinirdisht seemaa ke bich chah sigma ko baithaati he, vah deergh-kaal main keval 4
5 sigma hi baitha paaegi - kyonki yaa to samay ke saath prakriya ausat main badlaav aayega, yaa alpavadhi ke dauraan paae gaye prakriya ke maanak vichlan se dirghakaalik maanak vichlan adhik hoga, yaa donon sambhav he
 Therefore, the widely accepted definition of the Six Sigma process is one, which presents 3
4 missing parts per one million opportunities
 yah is tathy par aadhaarit he ki saamaanya rup se vitarit prakriya main ek seemaa ke baad 3
4 bhaag prati das lakh honge, jo ki ausat se upar yaa neeche 4
5 maanak vichlan hogi

 isaki abhiklpana vishuddh parichaalan main sambhavya abhaav staron ko kam aankane se rokna he
 Short-term sigma levels correspond to the following long-term DPMO values: ye aankade kalpana karte hai ki alpavadhi sigma str ko nirdhaarit karte hue praarambhik adhyayan ke kuch samay baad prakriya ausat 1

 Six Sigma has two main methods: DMAIC and DMADV, both inspired by Deming's plan-take-action-check-complete cycle
 DMAIC ek maujuuda vyapaar kii prakriya main sudhaar laane ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he; DMADV nae utpaada yaa prakriya ko pariklpit karne ke liye istemaal hota he
 The basic method is made up of the following five steps: buniyadi vidhi nimnlikhit paanch charnon se bani he : DMADV is also known as DFSS, an abbreviation for "D esign f or s ix s igma"

 The incident is later explored in the Going Lean book, which presents data to show that Ford's "6 Sigma" program did nothing to change its value

 Due to its arbitrary nature, the 1
5 Sigma shift has been dismissed by statistician Donald J
 Wheeler as "inane"
 isaki saarvbhaum prayojyata sandigdh rup main dekhi jaati he
 The 1
5 sigma shift is also controversial because it results in a fixed "sigma level", reflecting short-term results rather than long-term: a process that has long-term deprivation levels due to 4
5 sigma performance, the practice of Six Sigma
 Accordingly, he is defined as the "6 sigma process"
 atah sweekrut sicks sigma pariklan pranali maanak vichlan kii ghoshit sankhya ke liye vaastavik saamaanya vitaran sambhaavnaaon ke baraabar nahin maani ja sakati or vivaad kaa yah ek mukhya mudda rahaa he ki sicks sigma upayon ko kaise paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 The fact that it is seldom analyzed that the "6 sigma" system will have long-term depletion rates due to the performance of 4
5 sigma, rather than the actual 6 sigma execution, has led many commentators to say that six sigma is a confidential trick

 The smallest unit used in Hindi language is called varna
 jaise-a, aa, i, i, u, uu, k, kh aadi
 The community of letters is called the alphabet
 hindi varnmaala main 52 varna hai
 Based on pronunciation and usage, two distinctions of Hindi alphabet have been made: swar dishes jin varnon kaa uccharan swatantra rup se hota ho or jo vyanjanon ke uccharan main sahaayak hon ve swar kehalaate he
 These are thirteen in number: A, Aa, I, E, U, Oo, Ru, A, Ai, O, Au, An, Aa
 uccharan ke samay kii drushti se swar ke teen bhed kiye gaye hai: The changed form of vowels is called volume
 Following are the quantities of vowels: swar matraayen shabd a × Less aa kaam Idalaya i kheer Age rose uu bhul Debt free e kesh It is o chor Frame a varna kii koi maatra nahin hoti
 The following are their forms of cuisine: k ch chh j jh t th dh aadi
 If the mark below the consonant is removed
 tab ye is prakaar likhe jate hai: Some people like etc
 jin varnon ke purna uccharan ke liye swaron kii sahaayta lee jaati he ve vyanjan kehalaate hai
 That is, consonants cannot be spoken without the help of vowels
 ye sankhya main 33 hai
 It has the following three distinctions: inhen paanch virgon main rakhaa gaya he or har varg main paanch-paanch vyanjan hai
 Each class is named after the first class such as: ye nimnlikhit chaar hai:y r l v These are the following four - Shiva vaise to jahaan bhi do athwa do se adhik vyanjan mil jate hai ve sanyukt vyanjan kehalaate hai, kintu devanagari lipi main sanyog ke baad rup-parivartan ho jane ke kaaran in teen ko ginaya gaya he
 They are made up of two dishes
 jaise-ksha=k+sha akshar, jna=j+na gyaan, tra=t+r nakshatra kuch log ksh tr or jna ko bhi hindi varnmaala main ginate hai, par ye sanyukt vyanjan hai
 So it does not seem appropriate to count them in the alphabet
 iskaa prayog pancham varna ke sthaan par hota he
 Is its sign
 jaise- sambhav=sambhav, sanjay=sanjay, ganga =ganga
 It is pronounced like H
 iskaa chihn he
 As such, morning
 jab kisi swar kaa uccharan nasika or mukh donon se kiya jaataa he tab uske upar chandrabindu laga diya jaataa he
 This is called resonant
 jaise-hansnaa, aankh
 In the Hindi alphabet, 11 vowels and 33 consonants are counted, but the total number of Hindi alphabets becomes 48 by adding homogeneous alphabets, letters and letters
 jab kabhi vyanjan kaa prayog swar se rahit kiya jaataa he tab uske neeche ek tirchhi rekha laga di jaati he
 This line is called the plow
 halayukt vyanjan halant varna kehalaata he
 Like - One mukh ke jis bhaag se jis varna kaa uccharan hota he use us varna kaa uccharan sthaan kehete hai

 Dalip Singh was given an annual pension of five lakh rupees, and shortly thereafter he was sent to England with his mother, where Dalip Singh embraced Christianity and he remained a zamindar for some time in Narakak

 ambush marketing yaa ghaat vipanan ko ek aisi vipanan ranneeti ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he jisamen vigyapandaata kisi praayojan shulk kaa bhugtan kiye bina hi kisi kaarykram vishesh ke saath apane aap ko jod lete hai or is prakaar isse laabh praapt karte hai
 The Macmillan English dictionary defines ambush marketing as a marketing strategy in which a competing brand associates itself with a major sporting event without paying a sponsorship fee
 mekakarthi ke anusaar, ghaat vipanan ek company dwaara vipanan kaa aisa prakaar he jo kisi aayojan kaa aadhikarik praayojak nahin he, parantu jo aayojan kaa upyog karke vigyaapan karata he, taaki graahak kaa dhyaan vigyaapan kii ore aakarshith kiya ja sake
 From a theoretical perspective, in ambush marketing, the company attempts to capitalize on its popularity, credibility and reputation by associating itself with a particular event, while not agreeing to the party required for it
 ambush marketing main prayukt shabd "ambush" kaa arth he, "ghaat lagaakar hamalaa" or isaki vyutpatti ek puraani francisi kriya ambusier se hui he, jiskaa arth he "ek jangal main rakhana"
 shabd "ambush marketing" ko prasiddh vipanan ranneetijna jeri welsh dwaara diya gaya, jab ve 1980 ke dashak main american express company ke liye vishwastareey vipanan prayaason ke manager ke rup main kaary kar rahe the
 Direct ambush marketing isamen kuch aisi chijen shaamil hai jaise khel sanghathan kii anumati ke bina ek khel main muft tii-sharts baantnaa
aisa bhi saktaa he ki brands pehle se stadium ko apane chinhon se cover kar de, yaa sanghathan ne kisi or brands ko tii sharts baantne kii anumati di he
 In any case, it reduces the space of marketing, hindering the activities of the brand that the organization permits and thus creating a breach in official sponsorship
 apratyaksh ghaat vipanan Surprise ambush marketing graahak yah soch kar aage aa jate hai ki company is aayojan kii aadhikarik praayojak he
 Their goal at this time is to take advantage of the increased attention of media and television audiences around the event, to capitalize on it
 praayojakon kii badhati laagat: praayojakon kii badhati laagat ne nivesh-par-ritern par praayojak ke prabhaav ko badha diya he
 If the sponsored events do not display the feature, the sponsor's interest on the sponsoring property will be lost and this will harm the entire purpose market
 So whenever this exclusivity is lost, the value of sponsorship is also lost
 jab ek company ghaat vipanan main sanlagn hoti he, praayojak ke liye praayojan kaa phayda khatm ho jaataa he
 Therefore, the importance of sponsorship also decreases
 kyonki yah ek nirvivaad tathy he ki corporate praayojan, aayojan kii vayavastha karne waalon ke liye rajasav ke sabase bade paisa banane vaale sroton main se ek he, praayojan ke mulya main kshati aayojan kii vyavastha karne vaale kii vittiya prabalata ko prabhavit karegi
 Crimes on Intellectual Property Rights: Although ambush marketers are not directly related to protected intellectual property rights, they infringe on intellectual property rights in an effort to capitalize on the hard-earned credibility earned by organizing
 aayojan yaa aayojan ke pratik ke saath pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh sambandh, ayojlan kii vayavastha karne waalon ke adhikaron par gaiyr-kanoonee atikaraman he
 Also, sponsors do not get the anticipated results

 The practice of riveting rather than welding large steel structures was a proven and understood construction technique in those days, while the process of constructive welding was not developed enough to be used on the bridge at that stage

 Plans for building the bridge had begun to be made since 1815, when decorated and respected architect Francis Greenway proposed to Governor Laclan Macquarie that a bridge be built from the northern side of the port to the southern side
 In 1825, Greenway, in a letter to The Australian newspaper, stated that such a bridge would "experience the strength and elegance that reflects the credibility and glory of the colonies and the motherland
" greenve ke sujhaavon kaa koi fal nahin niklaa, lekin yah vichaar jeevant rahaa or unnisvin sadi main kai or suzav bhi diye gaye
 In 1840, naval architect Robert Brindley proposed that a floating bridge be built
 Around 1857 engineer Peter Henderson created one of the earliest drawings of the bridge over the harbor

 After the First World War, the plans for the construction of the bridge were accelerated again
 Bradfield continued in that project and began making special details and financing details for his Bahudharan bridge proposal and went on a foreign trip to examine tenders in 1921 
 apni yatraaon ke samay kiye gaye shodh ke aadhaar par bradfield ne nishchay kiya ki chaap dizin bhi upyukt ho saktaa he, or unhone or enesdbalu ke lokanirmaan vibhaag ke adhikariyon ne neuyark shahar ke hell get pul ke aadhaar par ek ekal-chaap vaale pul kaa ek saadhaaran dizin taiyaar kiya
 In 1922, the government passed Sydney Bridge Law No
 28 specifying the construction of a high-level outcrop or arcuate bridge between the Dawes Point and the Millsons Point, including the necessary entrances and electric rail lines, and for the project worldwide
 Tenders were invited from nivida prakriya ke parinamswaroop sarkaar ko chah companiyon se bees prastaav praapt hue; 24 march 1924 ko midilesbro kii angreji form darman long and company ko ek chapakar pul ke liye AU£4,217,721 austrailian pound kii uddhrut keemat par anubandh diya gaya

 To address concerns about a foreign firm participating in the project, Bradfield gave assurances that all the workers building the bridge would be Australians
 Bradfield and his staff were tasked with overseeing the design and construction process of the entire bridge, while Darmon Long & Company's Consulting Engineer, Sir Douglas Fox & Partners' Sir Ralph Freeman and their partners Mr
 GC Imbilt made a detailed design of the bridge and set the process of construction
 The contractors' architects were from the British firm John Burnett & Partners of Glasgow, Scotland

 Along with the construction of access routes, the work of preparing the necessary foundations to handle the arc's weight and burden was also started
 The granite-studded pillars made of concrete were constructed with angled corners in the lateral parts

 Putting a swing on these cranes, they were used to transport the workers and goods to the places required for the manufacture of steel
 In order to stabilize the steel material while constructing the arcs, steel cables were taken out of them by tunnels on each side and then fastened to the upper parts of each semi-arc so that they fell at the time of pulling out

 In less than two years, on Tuesday, August 19, 1930, the two half sections of the arc touched each other for the first time
 The workers interconnected the upper and lower sections of the arc by spikes and the arc became self-supporting, making it possible to remove supporting cables
 On 20 August 1930, the joy of the addition of arcs was celebrated by hoisting the flags of Australia and the United Kingdom on the arms of the creeper cranes

 In July 1931, construction started rapidly and pylons were built on the tops of the pillars
 The Egyptians made wooden scaffolds, behind which the masons made masonry and poured concrete
 Gangers built steel structures in the columns, while daily workers cleaned granite by hand with wire brushes
 The last stone of the north-western archway was planted on 15 January 1932 and the wooden columns used to support the cranes were removed

 Sixteen workers died at the time of construction, but surprisingly only two workers fell from the bridge
 More than this, workers were injured due to the unsafe working practices used when they were inserted into the bridge by heating the nails and the project was blamed for the deafness experienced by many workers in later years
 Between 1930 and 1932, Henry Mallard produced hundreds of photographs and films that closely displayed the bravery of the workers in the circumstances of the Depression era

 One such ribbon cutting ceremony was held at the northern end of the bridge by North Sydney Mayor Alderman Primrose without incident
 It was later revealed that Primrose was also a member of the New Guard, but his role or information in the de Groot incident is unclear, using the golden canes used in ribbon cutting ceremonies on both ends of the bridge
 Ribbon cutting was also done at the dedication of the inaugurated Beyon Bridge in Beyoncé, NJ, near New York City

 The Bradfield Highway has been named the Traveling Stock Route, which means that cattle are allowed to be carried over the bridge, but only between midnight and sunrise, and that too on prior notice
 In fact, this has not happened for nearly half a century, due to the high-density urban nature of modern Sydney and the restoration of slaughterhouses and markets

 After the decision to build the Sydney harbor tunnel in the early 1980s, the toll was increased to cover the cost of construction
 surang main bhi dakshin kii ore jane ke liye shuru main 2 dollars margkar tha
 After the passer-by was $ 1, the height of the concrete barrier separating the Bradfield Highway on the bridge from the Cahill Expressway was increased, as many drivers illegally skipped it to route number 6 to 7 so that They could avoid the toll tax
 The toll for all south-oriented vehicles was reduced to $ 3 in March 2004

 Shortly after the opening of the bridge, Archer Whitford converted this archway into a tourist spot for the first time since 1934
 He established several attractions there, including a cafe, a camera abasquera, a tribal museum, "a Mother's Nook" where visitors could write letters and a 'pashometer'
 mukhya aakarshan ek darshak platform tha, jahaan “aakarshak madadgaar” aagantukon ko uplabdh telescopon kaa prayog karne main sahaayta karte the, or grenite guard relon par laga ek tambe kaa aavaran us samay ke sidney ke upnagaron or mukhya sthanon ko darshata tha

 kakbhushundi ramcharitamanas ke ek paatr hai
 Saint Tulsidas ji has written in the Uttarakhand of Ramcharitmanas that Kakabhusundi is a supreme knowledgeable devotee
 ravan ke putr meghnath ne ram se yuddh karte huye ram ko nagapasha se band diya tha
 At the behest of Devarshi Narada, Garuda, who was a snakebite, ate all the snakes of Nagpash and rescued Rama from the bond of Nagpash
 ram ke is tarah nagapasha main bandh jane par ram ke parambrahm hone par garud ko sandeh ho gaya
 To remove the suspicion of Garuda, Devarshi Narada sent him to Brahma
 brahma ji ne unase kaha ki tumhaara sandeh bhagwaan shankar dur kar sakate hai
 Lord Shankar also sent Garuda to Kakabhusundi ji to erase his suspicions
 ant main kakbhushundi ji ne ram ke charitra kii pavitra katha suna kar garud ke sandeh ko dur kiya
 After Garuda's suspicion ended, Kakabhusundi ji narrated his own story to Garuda which is as follows: purv ke ek kalp main kaliyug kaa samay chal rahaa tha
 At the same time, Kakabhusundi ji was first born in a Shudra house in Ayodhya Puri
 us janm main ve bhagwaan shiv ke bhakt the kintu abhimanpurvak anya devataaon kii ninda karte the
 Once there was a famine in Ayodhya, he went to Ujjain
 vahaan ve ek dayaalu brahman kii seva karte huye unheen ke saath rahane lage
 He was a great devotee of the Brahmin Lord Shankar but never used to condemn Lord Vishnu
 unhone us shudra ko shiv ji kaa mantra diya
 His pride increased even more after getting the mantra
 vah anya dwijon se irshyaa or bhagwaan vishnu se droh karne laga
 Due to his behavior, his guru used to teach him devotion to Shri Rama, very sad
 ek baar us shudra ne bhagwaan shankar ke mandir main apane guru, arthath jis brahman ke saath vah rahata tha, kaa apmaan kar diya
 On this, Lord Shankar sounded the sky and cursed him that you sinner! You have disrespected the guru, so you go into the snake's vagina and after the snake vagina, you have to be born 1000 times in your vagina
 guru bade dayaalu the isaliye unhone shiv ji kii stuti karke apane shishy ke liye kshamaa prarthana kii
 On apologizing by the Guru, Lord Shankar sounded in the air and said, "O Brahmin! My curse will not go in vain
" is shudra ko 1000 baar janm avashya hi lenaa padegaa kintu janmane or marane main jo duhsah dukh hota he vah ise nahin hoga or kisi bhi janm main iskaa gyaan nahin mitega
 It will remain a remembrance of each of its births, nothing will be rare in the world and it will have an uninterrupted pace everywhere, by my grace it will also get devotion towards the feet of Lord Shri Rama
 " After that the Shudra went to Vindhyachal and got a snake vagina
 kuch kaal bitne par usne us sharir ko bina kisi ksht ke tyaag diya vah jo bhi sharir dhaaran karata tha use bina ksht ke sukhpurvak tyaag detaa tha, jaise manushya puraane vastra ko tyaag kar nayaa vastra pahan letaa he
 He used to remember every birth
 shri ramachandra ji ke prati bhakthi bhi usamen utpann ho gai
 He found the last body of a Brahmin
 brahman ho jane par gyanprapti ke liye vah lomash rishi ke paas gaya
 When Lomash Rishi gave him knowledge, he used to do many kinds of arguments with them
 uske is vyavhaar se kupit hokar lomash rishi ne use shaap de diya ki ja tu chandal pakshi ho ja
 He immediately flew off as a crow
 shaap dene ke pashchaat lomash rishi ko apane is shaap par pashchaatap hua or unhone us coy ko waapas bula kar ramamantra diya tathaa ichha mrityu kaa vardaan bhi diya
 After getting the body of the crow, he fell in love with that body due to getting Ramantra and he started living as a crow and became known as Kakabhusundi

 isamen prakritik paryaavaran kii suraksha par vishesh bal diya jaataa he
 Adam Smith was a Scottish politician, philosopher and political economist
 unhen arthshaastra kaa pitamah bhi kaha jaataa he
 Adam Smith's name comes first among the makers of modern economics
 His book 'the wealth of nations has greatly influenced the historians and economists of the eighteenth century
 From Karl Marx to David Ricardo, many famous economists, sociologists and politicians have taken inspiration from Adam Smith
 Among the economists of the twentieth century who drew inspiration from Adam Smith's ideas, the names of Marx, Engels, Malthus, Mill, Kens and Friedman are notable
 Adam Smith himself was influenced by scholars such as Aristotle, John Lock, Hobbs, Mendville, Francis Hutcheson, Hume etc
 Smith did notable work in the fields of economics, political philosophy and ethics
 But he got special recognition only in the field of economics
 Modern marketism can also be seen as a recognition of Adam Smith's ideas
 Adam Smith's date of birth is not sure
 Some scholars consider him to be born on 5 June 1723 and some on 16 June of the same year
 Whatever it was, he was born in Kirkaldi, a village in Scotland
 Adam's father was in charge of the customs department
 But he died almost six months before Smith's birth
 Adam was possibly the only child of his parents
 He was still only four years old that suffered trauma
 Adam was kidnapped by an organization of Gypsies
 At that time his uncle assisted his mother
 Adam was consequently secured
 After his father's death, Smith was sent by his mother to study at the University of Glasgow
 At that time, Smith was only fourteen years old
 Due to his sharp intellect, he completed school level with good marks, due to which he started getting scholarship
 Which opened the way to Oxford University for further studies
 There he gained knowledge of ancient European languages
 By that time, it had not been decided that the student of linguistics would not only earn a name in the field of economics, but would also make an epoch-making contribution to the field of global economy on the basis of its fundamental foundations
 Smith in 1738 eminent scholar - Passed the undergraduate examination in moral philosophy under the leadership of the philosopher Francis Hutchison
 He was deeply influenced by Francis' intelligence and considered him and his days spent teaching, unforgettable
 Being very talented, Smith's talent was started to be recognized from the college level itself
 Therefore, after completing his studies, when young Smith returned to his native city of Scotland, by the time he had given many important lectures, his fame began to spread
 While living there, he studied David Hume's famous work a Treatise of Human Nature in 1740, which impressed him immensely
 David Hume was one of his role models
 The two had a deep friendship
 Hume himself was highly impressed by Rousseau's talent
 An incident is mentioned behind the friendship of both
 According to which Hume once saw Rousseau's personal diary, he made serious comments about religion, society, politics, economics, etc
 After that incident, the two became close friends
 Hume was almost ten years older than Adam Smith
 In addition to David Hume, the names of John Smith, Hugh Blair, Lord Hallis, and Principal Robertson, among the prominent friends of Adam Smith, are notable
 He got the first offerings of his hard work and talent quickly
 In 1751, Smith got a job as a spokesperson for logic at the University of Glasgow
 The following year, he was made the head of the department of moral philosophy
 Smith's work of writing and teaching was going on continuously
 In 1759, he completed his book 'principle of moral sensations'
 This book became the subject of discussion with its publication
 In addition to his English, German and French versions started selling hands-on
 The book was about the relationships and moral behavior of the individual and society
 By that time, Smith's tendency was limited to political philosophy and ethics
 Gradually Smith began to get bored with the monotonous and monotonous environment of the universities
 He began to realize that what he wanted to do was not possible to do it in the college environment
 Meanwhile, his tendency towards economics was increased
 Especially during the teaching on political philosophy, economic aspects were also considered in the lecturers
 One of his students compiled his thoughts, Which were later edited by Edwin Cannon
 Only in those articles were the elements of 'wealth of Nations' safe
 After spending nearly twelve years in the field of teaching, Smith resigned from his college job and started teaching tuition to earn a living
 During this period he traveled to France and European countries and met contemporary scholars David Hume, Voltaire, Rousseau, Francis Quesne, Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, etc
 Meanwhile, he also wrote many research essays, due to which his reputation increased
 He returned to Kirkaldi a few years later
 While living in his native village, Smith completed his most talked about book, The Wealth of Nations, a unique book on political science and economics
 With the publication of the book in 1776, Adam Smith began to be counted among the scholarly scholars of his time
 Philosophy has influence on this book
 Those who are not familiar with Smith's life, He would be even more surprised to know that Smith had written this book in connection with his teaching work as a professor of philosophy
 In those days, books of history and philosophy were taught more in universities, there was also a subject of theological studies
 The study of jurisprudence simply means a detailed study of the judicial system naturally
 Contemplation of Government and then Economy of Economy
 In this way it is clear that in his book 'wealth of Nations', Smith has given philosophical discussions of economic principles
 The novelty of the subject and the original style of presentation are the main features of the book
 He had a rich library, which contained hundreds of rare texts
 He liked to live in a quiet and secluded environment, where no one would interrupt his life
 Smith remained a bachelor for a lifetime
 Work should not be hurt by the absence of happiness and the presence of unrest in life, so he said that society should be formed on the basis of the usefulness of human beings, such as merchant groups are formed; Not on mutual attachment or any other emotional basis
 Adam Smith's fame in the field of economics is due to his well-known theory, 'leje Fair', which later became the promoter of liberal economic policies
 Leje Fair meant 'freedom to work', that is, minimal government intervention in the field of economic activities
 The correct information about the true origins of this slogan that propounds modern industrial capitalism and revolutionized the production system is not claimed
 But there is a popular story in this regard, according to which this quote was born in 1680, The then influential French Finance Minister jean-baptiste Colbert met during a meeting with businessmen of his own country
 The leadership of the team of traders was M
 Lee
 Was doing gendry a team of traders had reached Colbert with their problems
 In those days, traders were facing an ever increasing competition in the production system on the one hand, on the other hand government laws seemed binding on them
 After listening to them, Colbert expressed some resentment and said - "what can the government do to help businessmen in this?" Took on Gendry immediately responded in a simplistic tone - 'lease-now Fair
' His intention was, 'you leave us on our condition, let us only do our work
' As the popularity of this theory grew, Adam Smith gained recognition as an economist
 At that time Adam Smith did not know that he was representing such an economic theory, Which will one day prove to be revolutionary for the global economy
 Two years after the publication of the book titled 'nation's Wealth', Smith got the job of Commissioner in the Customs Department
 The same year he was shocked when he got the news of the death of his close friend and famous philosopher David Hume of his time
 The post of Custom Commissioner proved to be a challenge for Smith
 While in that position he had to deal with the problem of smuggling; Which he had established in his book The Wealth of Nations as 'universal deeds behind the face of unnatural legislation'
 When the Edinburgh Royal Society was established in 1783, Smith was named its founding member
 For Smith's special services in the field of economics and politics, he was nominated as Honorary Rector of Glasg University
 He remained unmarried for a lifetime
 Due to being busy in study and teaching night and day, his health started getting messed up
 vaichariki Adam Smith is considered one of the makers of the modern economy
 Inspired by his ideas, while socialist thinkers like Karl Marx, Engels, Mill, Ricardo carried forward their ideology, the seed of modern state economy is also rooted in Smith's ideas
 Smith's economic social thinking is contained in his two books
 The first book is titled - Principles of Moral Feeling "in which he has attempted to review human behavior
 The book is influenced by Smith teacher Francis Hutcheson
 In the book, moral philosophy has been divided into four classes - morality, virtue, sense of personal rights and freedom
 In this book, Smith classifies the entire moral behavior of man into two parts — 1
 Nature of morality 2
 Goal of ethics In the nature of morality, Smith has included property, desires etc
 While in the second category, Smith has reviewed human sensibilities, selfishness, longing etc
 Smith's second important book is 'exploring the nature of the wealth of the nation and its reasons' This unique book is in five volumes
 In the book, various topics such as political science, economics, human behavior etc
 have been considered, but it mainly analyzes Smith's economic ideas
 Smith, while supporting the free economy, has shown how to protect our interests in such times, how to make the maximum profit of technology, how a welfare state can be tested on the basis of religiosity and How can society be taken on the path of development through commercial competition
 Smith's ideology presents this analysis in a very objective way
 Smith has also been accused of being an individualist because of this book
 But scholars who consider Smith a staunch individualist may be shocked by the fact that most of his work is focused on human morality and public welfare
 In his second book, 'the Principle of Moral Perceptions', Smith writes —' How can the concept of a completely selfish person be well? There are definitely some principles of nature that make it necessary for him to relate his happiness to others, by which he does not get anything other than to see them happy
 ' The victim may think that there are really some laws of nature that can prove beneficial for him in the fate of others and happiness for him Can cause
 Whereas this is its sheer illusion
 He could not think of anything except this
 In one place, Smith has written, referring to the monotony and limitations of human behavior, that "we do not have an authentic experience of what the other person thinks
" Nor do we have any knowledge about what it actually affects
 Except that we can guess something by imagining ourselves to be in those circumstances
 We can also be relaxed by seeing our brother standing on the balconydon't care about what is going on
 Our sensations remain dormant about his condition
 They neither go beyond our 'us', nor can they go; That is, we can only guess about its actual condition
 There is no power in his consciousness that can give us a real sense of his troubles and state of mind, until the time we think of ourselves by putting ourselves in his circumstances
 But our own thinking is only our thinking and concept, not his
 Through imagination, we are only able to guess his position
 '' Smith has given the exact position by the above quote
 a lot of our everyday behavior is done only through conjecture and imagination
 Smith has also taken the side of personal happiness without any hesitation while avoiding the unexpected pressures of emotion and morality
 According to him loving himself, Taking care of your comforts and making necessary efforts for them is not ineffective or immoral in any sense
 He said that life will become very difficult if our tender sensations and love, which is our core emotion, start controlling our behavior all the time, and there is no desire for the welfare of others; Or he started to consider the defense of his ego as the best, and neglecting others should become his religion
 Empathy and personal benefits are mutually complementary rather than conflicting with each other
 Humans continue to get opportunities to help others
 In a treatise called 'the wealth of nations', Smith explains benevolence and welfare in a very objective manner
 According to Smith, due to lack of practice, our psyche is not ready to accept such beliefs, although our conduct continues to point to the same
 The duality that exists within our heart keeps churning us
 At one place, he writes that it is impossible to fulfill the needs only on the basis of religion or charity
 The presence of personal interests is also mandatory for him
 He writes - 'our food is not a gift of kindness to a butcher, a wine-maker or a tandoorwala
 It is a reward for the work done for themselves, for their inherent benefit
 'according to the smith, if a man works hard for earning, it is his work done for his own happiness
 But its effect is not limited to that itself
 In the process of earning, he somehow connects with others
 They take their support and through their product, they fulfill the needs of their society as well
 In order to earn something in the competition, he has to produce something different from others
 The ratio of the specificity of production and the technology used for production determines its success
 In the treatise titled 'wealth of Nations', Smith writes that -' Every entrepreneur is constantly striving to make maximum profit on his investment amount
 He does this work for himself, only with his good wishes and not for the welfare of the society
 It is also true that for his own good, he tries to take his business as much as possible, expanding production and employment opportunities as much as possible
 But late in the process, society also has the benefit
 Smith in the book 'wealth of Nations' written in five sections, Smith has also tried to explain the reasons for their prosperity and their nature
 But his insistence has been to minimize control over the economy
 According to Smith, the first reason for prosperity is a favorable division of labor
 Here, the meaning of compatibility is to make the maximum productive by using the efficiency of any person
 An example of Smith to illustrate this fact has been very popular — imagine that ten artisans could make forty-eight thousand pins a day, provided that their production process is divided into individual parts
 Any special task of production process should be assigned
 Someday if even one of them is absent; One of them could hardly make a pin in a day
 Because the efficiency of a particular artisan is the ability to complete any one stage of the production process
 'smith was in favor of free trade
 He said that governments should take up all those laws which work to frustrate the producers by hindering the development of productivity
 He opposed the trade-related laws that were being run by tradition and said that such laws negatively impact productivity
 It has also opposed taxes levied in the name of imports and laws supporting it
 In the field of economics, his theory is known as 'lassé Fair'
 Which means - Let them work voluntarily
 In other words, Smith wanted his release of control for the smoothness of the production process
 He was in favor of specialization of production in place of expansion of the production area, so that maximum use of mechanical skills and human labor could be taken
 Production should be cheap and reach the maximum
 He said that - 'if any country is willing to give any item cheaper than the cost of production in our country, then it is our duty to buy it from there
 And plan the labor and resources of our country in such a way that it can be as effective as possible and we can take appropriate advantage of it
 '' Must be from many merchants
 Should be without any mutual benefit or desire
 The desire to produce is the basic driving force of entrepreneurship
 But there is no possibility of profit with production, if the law instead of helping, stands in its way, then its desire may also die
 In that case both that person and the nation are at a disadvantage
 According to Smith — 'consumption is directly related to production
 Any person produces because he wishes to produce
 On fulfilling the desire, he can opt out of the production process or even postpone the production process for some time
 When a person produces more than what he needs, at that time he wishes to take additional production, by which he can shuffle any other thing from another person
 If a person aspires for something and makes something else, then it may be his desire to produce that he can exchange it with the things that he desires and get well from him
 As he could have made them himself
 'smith considered the division of work completely natural and supported it in a free voice
 This shows his scientific vision and foresight
 On the basis of his ideas, America and European countries adopted the free economy
 The relevance of his ideas remains unchanged even after centuries
 Even radical communist countries like China and Russia remain advocates of free economy to remain in the industrial competition
 Analyzing different aspects of production, Smith said that the contribution of workers and artisans in the success of industries also does not diminish
 They invest in their labor skills and help them in production
 Smith has also written that in a place where it is difficult to understand the trend of production, the rates of wages can be higher than normal
 Because people, unless they have no additional benefit, will not like to learn
 The possibility of additional wages or higher than normal earnings motivates them to adopt the new method
 In this way, Smith has indicated specific symptoms of spontaneous mankind
 Similarly, such works where a person has to work in adverse conditions from the point of view of health or in factories running in unsafe places will have to keep the wages rates higher than normal
 Otherwise, people will continue to run for safe and preferred targets for wages and there will be a lack of trained personnel in such factories
 Smith has used facts in a very balanced and rational manner at every place
 In his book 'wealth of Nations' he makes it clear that the difference in the trend of work can be balanced with the difference of salary
 a feature of his writing is also that he uses facts and arguments to explain the matter rather than a long description
 Smith's ideas about internationalization of the production system also meet the test of modern economy
 In this regard, he was of the opinion that - If a foreign country is ready to provide us with relatively cheaper consumer goods, it would be appropriate to order it from there
 Because only through that some productive power of our country will be used to carry out such works which are more important and beneficial
 Ultimately we will benefit from this arrangement
 'smith's installations during the analysis are not limited to merely describing the production technology of pins or merely showing the difference between the salary of a butcher and a rickshaw puller
 Rather, on the pretext of this, he also works to solve the complex political issues of nations
 The trend of making international strategy through economic relations has become common nowadays
 Rich industrialized countries do this work with great efficiency
 But his seed has been present in Smith's thinking since the eighteenth century
 In the fourth book of the 'nation's Wealth' series, in 1776, Smith explicitly told the British government that expenditure on American colonies, their own value More than
 Explaining the reason for this, he said that the British monarchy is a very expensive system
 He had proved on the basis of the data that instead of political control, a clean economy can be a more effective system for control
 He was in favor of keeping the government away from economic issues
 In this case, Smith was ahead of certain modern economists
 But if everything is to be done by the capitalists or the system created with their cooperation through economic policies, then what is the responsibility of the government? What can she do to maintain her supremacy? In this regard Smith had a very clear view that the government can maintain its control through arrangements such as patent law, contract, license and copyright
 Not only this, the government can keep the works of public importance such as building bridges, roads, restrooms etc
 under its control, where people can benefit from the prosperity of the nation
 In priority areas, in areas where entrepreneurs have less interest to work, the government can discharge its duties by maintaining the pace of development
 Smith's ideas in support of the capital system are practical in many places, and sometimes he seems to be crossing the boundaries of redundancy
 He was supportive of turning the government into a complementary system rather than a self-governing authority
 Whose task is to help productivity as much as possible
 He also thought that citizens should also pay the prescribed fee in proportion to the use of facilities
 But this does not mean that Smith wanted to completely free governments from the responsibility of their citizens
 He believed — 'no society can be considered happy and prosperous as long as the majority of its members are poor, unhappy and depressed
' Smith was an advocate of free competition in terms of trade and production technology
 He believed that the arrival of competition in the field of economy would be in accordance with 'natural law'
 Smith's natural law is certainly an extension of the law of the forest, in which the survival of life makes the struggle mandatory
 The concept of cooperatives was not born in Smith's time, the idea of socialism was also in the womb of the development of public consciousness
 On one hand, he insisted on making the production more competitive by linking it to the competition
 On the other hand, by interconnecting production and morality, he showed the way to keep the face of the production system humane
 However, why should the bourgeoisie, which considers maximum profit as its best, follow morality without any selfishness, why should it be such a compulsion? He has not given any indication towards this
 Yet Smith's ideas have been the most original and influential in his time
 Smith had said earnestly that "in any civilized society, man needs the support and cooperation of others
" Whereas, to make a few friends, one life remains inadequate
 Among creatures, an organism moving towards adulthood is usually used to be lonely and independent
 Helping others is not a part of his nature
 But this is not the case with humans
 He is always worried about the welfare of his brothers and relatives for his selfishness
 Obviously, man expects the same for himself
 Because it is impossible for him to carry on with the wishes of the only person
 He will work to make his relationship even stronger, if he can make a place for himself in their pleasures
 He will also try to show that it is in his own interest to do all the tasks that he expects from them
 Whatever duty a man performs towards others, it is a kind of bargain - that is, you give me what i want, In return you will get all that you wish for
 This is the principle of giving something to someone, this is the only way through which our social relations get expanded and on whose support this world runs
 Our food is not a gift to the kindness of any butcher, winemaker or oven seller
 This is a byproduct of the work done for themselves, for their inherent benefit
 'thus we see that Adam Smith's economic ideas are not only practical, original and far-sighted; Rather, even today, he is retaining his publicity
 Perhaps it would be more appropriate to say that they are more relevant today than before
 In his ideology, we do not see any deviation of thoughts or sense of confusion
 Smith also had full faith in beliefs, which is why he could gather many facts to support his argument
 This is why Smith was as impressed by the economists that followed; No other economist of that period was able to do the same
 However, Adam Smith had to face criticism from the people for his views
 Some scholars think that his views are influenced by the book of Endorser Chandinius, 'the National Gain and David Hume'
 Some scholars have also accused him of promoting anarchic capitalism
 But it is only fair to assess the views of any scholar in its totality
 Scholars who assess Smith's ideas are often limited to industrial production ideas, forgetting that Smith's ideas of production include the duties of government and citizens
 However, his ideological sharpness has also been praised by his sharp opponents
 Many scholars and researchers of the world are still engaged in analyzing its economic principles
 If the relevance of the views of a scholar remains after centuries, then it is definitely a symbol of his greatness
 While Smith has not only influenced generations of scholars, but has also produced several generations of economists
