 When Germany invaded Poland in 1939, journalists in Western countries adopted the term blitzkrieg to explain this form of armored warfare
 The Blitzkrieg operations proved extremely effective during the Blitzkrieg campaigns between 1939 - 1941

 1970 ke dashak ke baad se shikshavidon ne ek susangat sainya siddhant yaa ranneeti ke rup main blitcraig ke astitv par sawaal uthaaya he
 Many academician historians believe that blitzkrieg is itself a myth
 anya log is shabd kaa upyog dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan german ranneeti or siddhant kii vyakhya ke liye karte hai 
 Blitzkrieg's ideal interpretation is a part of the German strategic and operational process in the first half of World War II, often understood as a new way of fighting skills
 ranneetik taur par is shabd kaa matlab "bijli yuddh" se he jiskaa sambandh kisi dushman rajya par puri taiyaari ke saath yuddh karne se pehle usapar vijayi badhat hasil karne ke liye kiye jane vaale chote-chote twarit evam nirnaayak yudhon kii shrinkhalaa se judaa he
 Blitzkrieg's strategic meaning is to use tanks, battle-ready infantry, artillerymen and aircraft in mutual cooperation to destroy an enemy and penetrate its defense lines, so that the local forces are at the time of the fighting
 But a destructive superiority situation could arise
 The blitzkrieg used by the Germans is seen as important psychological and as some authors say "terrorist" elements such as the propellant on the Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers to influence the military's confidence
 When the enemy became familiar with these voices, most of the equipment was removed, although after the French War in 1940, there were many times with whistles

 The origin of the term blitzkrieg is not entirely clear
 ise german sena yaa vaayu sena ke sainik siddhant yaa hast-pustika ke sheershak ke taur par kabhi istemaal nahin kiya gaya tha
 It seems that before 1939 it was rarely used in the German military press
 Recent research conducted at the German Military Historical Institute in Freiburg revealed only two military articles in the 1930s in which the term was used
 donon main se koi bhi aalekh moulik rup se kisi tarah ke nae military siddhant yaa yuddh niti kii vakaalat nahin karata he
 In both, the term has been used only to mean a quick strategic victory
 pehla aalekh, jise 1935 main prakashit kiya gaya tha, mukhyatah yuddh kaal ke dauraan khaadya samagriyon kii aapurti ke bare main bataata he
 The term blitzkrieg is used here in reference to Germany's efforts for a quick victory in the First World War and is not linked to the use of armored or mechanical or air power
 tark yah he ki germany ko khaadya aapurti main aatmanirbharta viksit karnaa aavashyak tha kyonki use apane dushmano par tivrata se fatah hasil karnaa ek baar phir se asambhav sabit ho saktaa tha or ek lanbaa sampurna yuddh taalna aprihaary sabit ho saktaa tha
 The second article published in 1938 states that the beginning of a rapid strategic victory is an important attraction for Germany but it appears that under modern conditions it would be very difficult to achieve such a victory from ground attacks unless a typical high level may not become a surprise
 Roughly the authors suggest that a large tactical airstrike may create better prospects, but no detailed explanation has been provided on this subject

 During World War I, the two sides were embroiled in a trench warfare on the Western Front, where overlapping fires of machine guns and lethal fields created by barbed wire prevented both sides from gaining a decisive edge

 That is why the German Army had first gained experience of the capability of tanks to replace the battle site

 pratham vishwa yuddh ke baad, in avadharanaon ko rashver dwaara sanshodhit kiya gaya tha
 The Chief of Staff of the German Army, Hans von Secht, took the principle away from this criterion with his argument that excessive attention was focused on siege on the basis of speed

 This was accompanied by coordinated artillery troops and aerial bombardment, followed by huge infantry with heavy guns, which destroyed the centers of resistance
 These concepts became the basis of Wehrmacht's strategy during World War II

 The East's study of operations concluded that smaller and coordinated military forces had more fighting power than non-coordinated military forces

 Although the lessons of the British Army were mainly drawn from the attacks of infantry and artillery troops on the Western Front in late 1918, one of these "slide show" theaters included some aspects of operations that later Called blitzkrieg

 Later, Marshal Mikhail Tkachechewski, one of the most prominent officers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union, developed the concept of operation deep from his experiences of the polish-soviet War during the war years
 These concepts guided the Red Army doctrine during World War II

 HP Willmott has noted that there are two important differences in deep war - it advocated the idea of an all-out war, not limited operations, and the idea of decisive war in favor of multiple large-scale and similar attacks

" Heinz Guderian was perhaps the first person who fully developed and advocated the principles associated with blitzkrieg
 They summarized the joint-arms strategy as a way for the mobile and motorized armored branches to work together and help each other in achieving decisive success
 apni pustak, panzar leader main unhone likhaa: Guderian believed that it was necessary to develop techniques to support this theory; Especially for armed armored branches - for tanks with the most prominent wireless communication mediums
 In 1933, Guderian emphasized to the High Command that every tank in the German armored force must have a radio

 During the war, the vulture army took responsibility for the bombing of Guernica which had a tremendous psychological impact on the population of Europe
 The results were exaggerated and the Western Allies concluded that the technique of "raiding the city" had now become a part of the German method of warfare

 But due to the lack of accurate targeting, a technique of carpet bombing was chosen which caused a large number of civilian casualties

 To achieve a breakout, armored military forces attacked the enemy's defense line directly with the help of motorized infantry, artillery fire and aerial bombardment in order to create rifts in the enemy's line

 Achieving success in the enemy's rear areas, the German army tried to paralyze the enemy's ability to react
 Running faster than the enemy's troops, the mobile troops took advantage of the weaknesses and acted upon them before the opposing troops reacted
 Its centerpiece is a decision cycle
 german yaa virdohi sainya balon dwaara kiye gaye prayek nirnay ke liye jaankaree ikattha karne, nirnay lene, maatahat karmiyon ke bich aadesh prasaarit karne or is nirnay ko karrwai ke jariye lagu karne main samay kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Through excellent maneuverability and fast decision-making cycles, mobile military forces were able to act quickly in a situation comparable to anti-military forces

 Instead of obtaining a clear command, the commander was said to be intent on his superior and the role his unit played in this concept

 As a result, important decisions took effect quickly and either verbally or with written orders over a length of a few pages

 During the early stages of Barbarossa, a massive siege of equipment was carried out, along with a massive number of Soviet prisoners

 The German Army's successes are closely related to the extent to which the German Luftwaffe was able to control air warfare in earlier campaigns in Europe and the Soviet Union

 In fact, it was far from being a dedicated Panzer-led army, where less than 15 percent of the Luftwaffe was designed in 1939 to provide close aid to the Army

 Where it was not possible to have the ability to conduct rapid movements in "tanked countries", armored penetrations were often avoided or resulted in failure

 If instead it was mountainous, wooded, marshy, or urban, the armored army would be weakened by infantry in the case of fighting in close-by areas and unable to move at a rapid pace

 There is no doubt that the mountainous, extremely densely-forested Ardennes could have been relatively easily defended by the Allies, even against the sheer volume of German armored units
 However, naturally because the French thought that the Ardennes would not be suitable for extensive military activities, especially tanks, they left the field after only mild defensive efforts, which Vermakt immediately captured

 Allied air superiority became an important barrier to German operations during the last years of the war

 However, the Western Allies' air-to-ground aircrafts sparked so much fear out of proportion to their actual strategic success that the crew of Operation Overlord German vehicles thereafter showed reluctance to undertake a wide range of activities in broad daylight
 In fact, the last German blitzkrieg operation in the West, Operation Wakt am Rhein, was planned to be tried during inclement weather that smashed Allied aircraft

 Blitzkrieg is far too weak to face an enemy who pays too much attention to anti-tank combat skills and anti-aircraft weapons, especially when the side using Blitzkrieg is not ready in advance
 During the Battle of France in 1940, D
 The men of the 4th Armored Division of Gaule and the Army Tank Brigade of the British forces of the British Expedition both carried out attacks on the German side by investigation, in fact many And pushed to the back of the armored columns that move
 This could possibly be a reason for Hitler to order the German frontline to halt

 While the Allied forces lacked the experience to successfully develop these strategies in 1940, the result was the surrender of France with heavy losses, which they recognized in the subsequent Allied operations
 For example, in the Battle of Kursk, the Red Army jointly used extremely deep, elaborate landmines and a strong defense system of breakthrough shoulders as a defensive effort
 is tarah unhone german sena kii ladaaku kshamta ko shunya kar diya, iske baavjood ki german sainik aage bad gaye the
 In August 1944 at Mortain, impassioned defensive efforts and counter-attacks against German flanks by American and Canadian military forces closed the Falais area
 In the Ardennes, the Hedgehog defense system at Bastone, St
 Vith, and elsewhere, and a combined retaliatory effort by Patton's Third US Army, were used

 The British Army used the tanks in its traditional role of helping the infantry before their blitzkrieg and spread it among the entire army to prevent the accumulation of tanks, while the blitzkrieg's way of concentrating the tanks, even That was less in number and less capable in capacity, which led to the winning success

 Its stated goal was "to destroy Russian military forces stationed in the West and to prevent their attempts to escape into the wide open spaces of Russia"
 An important factor was the surprise attack that involved nearly wiping out the entire Soviet Air Force from simultaneous attacks at airports

 As the war progressed, Allied forces began to use joint weapon formations and deep penetration strategies that Germany had used in the early years of the war

 These tactics based on artillery troops also proved to be decisive in operations on the Western Front after Operation Overlord, and both the British Commonwealth and US forces developed flexible and powerful systems to use the aid of artillery troops

 There is some doubt as to the origin of the Blitzkrieg, if it existed then who contributed to it, was it part of the German war strategy between 1933 - 1939
 ek anukool military ranneeti ke rup main blitcraig kaa astitv tha yaa nahin is baat ko lekar ek vyapak str par bahes chalati rahi he
 Many historians now believe that the Blitzkrieg was not a military doctrine and that the expedition carried out by the German military from 1939 to about 1942 was a modified attack combined and modified at the last moment and therefore was not a proper military strategy
 pehle bhi blitcraig ko sainya maamalon main ek krantikari badlaav ) ke rup main dekha jaataa tha
 In recent years, a large number of writers and historians have concluded that it was not a new form of war invented by the German Army, but an old way of fighting decisive war using new techniques
 germany ne apni yuddh kii yojana blitcraig ke ird-gird taiyaar kii thi yaa nahin, is baat par asahmati he
 The popular view can be summarized in an essay published in 1965 by Captain Robert o'neill, Professor of War History at the then Oxford University
 german sena main siddhant or prashikshan 1919-1939 par likhte hue o'nil ne kaha tha: The only idea: Blitzkrieg's development makes this story remarkable

 Some historians were willing to go even further, claiming that the Blitzkrieg was not just an operational theory of German military hair, but a strategic concept on which the leadership of the Third Rash laid the basis for its strategic and economic plan
 jinalogon ne third rash kii sainya yojanaayen taiyaar kii thim or isaki yuddh kii aarthiki ko vyavasthit kiya tha, aisa lagata he ki unhone shaayad hi kabhi, agar kabhi, aadhikarik dastavejon main blitcraig shabd kaa istemaal kiya hoga
 yah vichaar ki german sena ne ek "blitcraig siddhant" par karrwai kii thi, 1970 ke dashak main mathew kupar ne iskaa prabalata se virodh kiya
 The concept of a blitzkrieg Luftwaffe was challenged by Richard Overy in the late 1970s and Williamson Murray in the mid-1980s
 yah thisis ki third rash "blitcraig kii aarthiki" ke aadhaar par yuddh main utraa, 1980 ke dashak main richard overi dwaara iskaa virodh kiya gaya or itihaaskaar rodgence ne kai, thode vivadpurn, arthon main is par prakaash daalaa, jahaan itihaaskaaron ne is shabd kaa istemaal kiya tha
 So far, not only the concept or theory of a German blitzkrieg survives in popular consciousness and popular literature, but it remains firmly in agreement with many professional historians
 shaikshanik monographon se nirantar aisa lagata he ki ye blitcraig kii "utpatti" yaa "jadon" ko khodne kaa abhipraay dete hai, 
 In his book The Blitzkrieg Legend, the German historian karl-heinz Fraser refers to the "blitzkrieg" sense of "a worldwide confusion"
 overi, kupar or anya ke saath sahmati vyakt karte hue freizer ne blitcraig siddhant ke astitv ko nakaar diya or yah tark dete hai ki 1914 main sliphen yojana ke naakaam hone ke baad german sena is nishkarsh par pahaunchi ki nirnaayak yuddh kii karrwai ek ranneetik str par puri nahin kii ja sakati he
 This means that the idea of an initial mass-level attack cannot be turned into a spooky action

 This was done only after the tentatively prepared plan for the invasion of Western Europe in 1940 and its successful conclusion, which convinced the General Staff of Germany that decisive battles were not obsolete

 Historians Simeon Naveh and Richard Overy rejected the idea that blitzkrieg was a military doctrine
 naveh kehete hai, "blitcraig kii avadharana kii mukhya visheshta ek anukool siddhant kii sampurna anupasthiti thi jise opareshnon kii vaastavik karrwai ke liye saamaanya sangyanatmak aadhaar ke rup main kaam karnaa chahie tha
 Naveh interpreted this as an "immediate solution" to operational hazards that was thrown together at the last moment
 richard overi ne bhi is vichaar ko nakaar diya ki hitler or naaji shashan ne kabhi ek blitcraig yuddh kaa iraadaa kiya tha
 The suggestion was false that the German state deliberately streamlined its economy in order to carry out its comprehensive strategy as a series of small-scale campaigns in the near future
 vastav main hitler 1939 ke kaaphi samay baad kii taarikh main ek aseemit yuddh shuru karnaa chaahate the
 But the Third Rash's foreign policy forced the Nazi state to go to war before it was fully prepared
 1930 ke dashak ke dauraan hitler or vermact kii yojanaon ke aacharan main blitcraig tarika pratibimbit nahin hota he, balki iskaa bilkul ulataa hota he
 Historian J
J
 P
 Harris has directed that the German Army never used the term blitzkrieg
 ise kisi german sainya kshetra ke minial main, yaa to army yaa vaayu sena main, kabhi istemaal nahin kiya gaya
 It was first revealed in September 1939 by a reporter for the Times newspaper
 haris ne bhi ise khaarij kar diya ki german sena kii soch ne kisi tarah kii blitcraig maansikta viksit kii thi
 In his book Blitzkrieg Legend, the German historian karl-heinz Fraser also discusses Adam Toze's, Overy's, and Naveh's concerns over the myth of blitzkrieg economy and strategy
 iske alaava freizer kehete hai ki jivit german arthshaastriyon or german general staff ke sadasyon ne is baat se inkaar kiya he ki germany ek blitcraig ranneeti ke aadhaar par yuddh main utari thi
 The German arms industry was not fully ready until 1944, and that is why in the 1960s some historians, notably Alan Millward, developed the theory of the blitzkrieg economy
 milward ne yah tark diya ki german rash ek lambii ladaai nahin lard sakate the, isiliye isane jaan-boojhkar gaharaai main jaakar hathiyaaron kaa prayog karne se parhez kiya, jisase ki vistaar main jaakar shaastra-sajjit kiya ja sake or shighrata se jeet hasil karne kii ek shrinkhalaa ko jeetne main sakasham ho sake
 milward ne ek sampurna yuddh kii arthvyavastha or ek shaantikaal kii arthvyavastha ke bich sthit ek kathith arthvyavastha ke bare main bataaya
 blitcraig arthvyavastha kaa uddeshy german logon ko yuddh sthiti main ek ucchstareey jivan style kaa anand lene or pratham vishwa yuddh ke dauraan hui aarthik kathinaaiyon se bachane ke upaay karnaa tha
 Overy says Blitzkrieg as a "favorable military and economic concept has proved to be a difficult strategy to defend in light of the evidence"
 Milward's theory was completely contrary to Hitler's and German planners' intentions
 yah 1914 kii chaaya kaa unka dar tha jo ek chote yuddh ke liye vistaar main shastreekaran or ek lambi ladaai kii ashanka ke liye gaharaai tak shastreekaran ke bich uddeshyon ke dwandv main vijayi banakar ubhara tha
 The Germans knew about the error of the First World War and rejected the concept of orienting their economy to fight only a small war
 hitler ne keval ek ascharyajanak jeet par bharosa karne ko "aapraadhik" ghoshit kiya or kaha ki "hamen ascharyajanak hamalon ke saath-saath lambey samay tak chalane vaale yuddh ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 During the winter of 1939–40, Hitler reduced the size of the fighting manpower in order to bring as many skilled workers as possible back to the factories
 yah mahasoos kiya gaya tha ki yuddh kaa nirnay kaarkaanon main liya jayega, naa ki yah ek twarit-nirnay vaala panjar oparation hoga
 Throughout the 1930s, Hitler ordered a rearmament program that could not be considered limited
 november 1937 main hitler ne sanket diya tha ki zyaadaatar shastreekaran pariyojnaon ko 1943-45 tak puraa kar liya jayega
 cregsamarine kaa punah shastreekaran 1949 main puraa kar liya janaa tha, looftwafe kaa punah shastreekaran kaarykram 1942 main puraa hona tha jiske saath-saath sena ko baari bamavarshakon kaa istemaal kar ranneetik bambaari karne main sakasham hona tha
 The construction and training of motorized military forces and the complete preparation of rail networks would not have started until 1943 and 1944 respectively
 Hitler needed to avoid war until the completion of these projects
 1939 main hitler ke galat faislon ne isse pehle ki ve punah shastreekaran kaa kaary puraa karne main sakasham hote, unhen yuddh main utarane par majaboor kar diya
 After the war, Albert Spear pointed out that the German economy enjoyed the benefits of extensive armament, not to transfer capacity from civilian to military industry, but to streamline the economy
 richard overi yah bataaya ki 1939 tak german utpaadan kaa 23 pratishat military ke rup main tha
 Between 1937–1939, 70 percent of the investment capital went into the development of rubber, synthetic fuels, the aircraft and shipbuilding industries
 harman goring ne nirantar yah kaha ki chaturvarsheeya yojana kaa kaary germany ko sampurna yuddh ke liye phir se hathiyaarband karnaa tha
 Adolf Hitler's correspondence with his economists also suggests that he intended to wager war in 1943–1945 when the resources of Central Europe were channeled into the Third Rush
 1930 ke dashak ke uttarardh main jivan str ooncha nahin tha
 Consumption of consumer goods fell from 71 percent in 1928 to 59 percent in 1938
 yuddh arthvyavastha kii maangon ne sashastr balon kii maang ko puraa karne ke liye gaiyr-sainya kshetron main kharch kii raashi kam kar di thi
 On 9 September the head of the Rash Defense Council, Göring, called for a complete "implementation" of the livelihood of the national economy and fighting power for the duration of the war
 overi ise ek saboot ke rup main prastut karte hai ki ek "blitcraig arthvyavastha" kaa koi astitv nahin tha
 Adam Tozey supports Overy
 tuze bataate hai ki german arthvyavastha ek lambii ladaai ke liye yojana bana rahi thi
 The expenditure incurred for this war was extensive and it put the economy in serious trouble
 german netritv is baat se kam chintit tha ki naagarik arthvyavastha or nagarikon kii khapat sambandhi jaruraton ko kaise santulit kiya jayega, balki iske bajaay chintaa yah thi ki arthvyavastha ko sampurna yuddh ke liye sabase acchhee tarah kaise taiyaar kiya jaae
 ek baar jab yuddh shuru ho gaya tha, hitler ne apane aarthik visheshgyon se satarkta chhod dene or sabhi uplabdh sansadhano ko yuddh ke prayaason main kharch karne kaa anurodh kiya tha
 The expansion plans only slowly gained momentum in 1941
 Toews maintains that the plans for comprehensive armament in the pre-war period did not clearly indicate any blitzkrieg economy or strategy seen
 ek tark yah he ki yuddh kii shuruyaat main hir swayan blitcraig ke liye taiyaar nahin thim
 The Blitzkrieg method required a young, highly skilled mechanized army
 1939-40 main 45 pratishat sena 40 saal ke umr kii thi or sabhi sainikon main 50 pratishat ko sirf kuch hi hafton kaa prashikshan diya gaya tha
 The German army was not fully motorized, contrary to what the Blitzkrieg legend suggested
 german sena francisi sena ke 300,000 vaahanon kii tulana main sirf 120,000 vaahan hi juta paayi thi
 The British Army also had a "jealous" army of motorized forces
 is prakaar, german "blitcraig" sena kii chhavi ek prachaarit karne vaali kalpana kii managasaint kahani thi
 The German Army used 1
4 million horses for logistics during World War I, while it used 2
7 million horses in the 1939–45 war
 iske alaava 1940 main sena kaa sirf 10 pratishat hissaa motoryukt tha
 Half of the available German divisions were ready for battle in 1940, often poorly equipped, compared to the British and French armies and the 1914 German army
 1940 kii vasant ritu main german sena arddh-aadhunik thi
 a small number of the best equipped and "elite divisions" were decorated by several second and third level divisions
 kuch motoryukt or panjar divijanon ke atirikt, german sena kaa nabbe pratishat hissaa ek blitcraig sena nahin thi
 James Corum discusses a prevailing myth about the Luftwaffe and its blitz Craig operations that it had the principle of terror-bombing bombardment, in which civilians deliberately sought to help break confidence and smash the enemy
 Was targeted 1937 main guernika kii bambaari or 1940 main roterdam kii bambaari ke baad, aam taur par yah maan liya gaya tha ki aatanki bambaari looftwafe siddhant kaa ek hissaa tha
 During the post-war period, the Luftwaffe leadership rejected the concept of terrorist bombing and limited the use of air weapons to battlefield support of interceptive operations
 corum aage kehete hai; general valther wevar ne da conduct of da arial waar ke rup main pahachaane jane vaale ek siddhant ko sankalit kiya tha
 This document, adopted by the Luftwaffe, rejected Gulio Douhet's theory of terrorist bombings
 aatanki bambaari ko "pratikul" samajha jaataa tha, jo dushmano kii ichhashakti ko nasht karne kii bajaay pratirodh badhaane vaala tha
 The main operations of the Luftwaffe were to carry out such bombing operations; Demolition of military forces was considered distinct from the enemy
 guernika, roterdam or warsaw kii bambaariyaan military opareshnon ke samarthan main suniyojit mishan ke rup main thim or ranneetik aatanki hamalon ke iraade ke rup main nahin thim

 Harris says that most of Göring's Luftwaffe leaders, like their peers in Britain and the United States, through general staff believed that strategic bombing was a major mission of the Air Force and that with such a role the Luftwaffe could win the next war And that: looftwafe ne ek vaayu sena taiyaar kii thi jisamen mukhya rup se apekshaakrit kam duuri ke vimaan shaamil the, lekin isse yah sabit nahin hota he ki german vaayu sena akele hi "suniyojit" bambaari ke liye icchhuk thi
 This happened because the German aircraft industry lacked the experience to quickly build a long-range bomber fleet, and because Hitler was increasingly adamant on building large numbers of military forces
 yah bhi mahatvapurn he ki madhya europe main germany kii sthiti ne bhavishya ke sambhavit yuddh ke shuruaati charnon main ranneetik uddeshyon ke liye aavashyak or sirf "suniyojit" uddeshy ke liye upyukt bamavarshakon ke bich kaaphi had tak ek spasht antar rakhane kii jarurat mahasoos kii thi
 British theorists J

 Fuller and Captain B

 Liddell Hart has often been linked to the development of blitzkrieg, although this is a matter of controversy
 haal ke varshon main itihaaskaaron ne yah khulaasa kiya he ki lidele heart ne yah dikhaane ke liye ki jaise unke vichaaron ko apanaaya liya gaya tha, tathyon ko tod-marod diya he or jhootha sabit kar diya he
 Liddell Hart imposes his own beliefs after the war, after the event, claiming that the mobile tank warfare skills used by vermact were the result of his influence, the blitzkrieg itself is not an official theory and historians in recent times It has been concluded that it did not exist that way: yah ek siddhant ke vipareet tha
 The blitzkrieg was made up of a stirring rock of action that was accomplished less by design and more by success
 paroksh drushti main - or lidele heart se kuch madad ke saath - karrwai kii prachand dhara ko is tarah nichod diya gaya tha ki jaise yah: ek oparation sambandhi dizin hi nahin tha
 "by manipulation and tact, Liddell Hart distorted the actual conditions of the creation of the blitzkrieg and he blurred its roots
 ek dikhaawati avadharana ke apane gaiyr-saidhantik adarshikaran ke madhyam se unhone blitcraig ke myth ko prabalit kar diya"
 blitcraig kii uthali avadharana par mobile yuddh kaushal kii apni swayan dharanaon ko, purvyaapee tareeke se lagu karte hue, unhone "ek saidhantik avyavashtha paidaa kar di jise spasht karne main 40 saal lag gaye
 The literature of the early 1950s transformed Blitzkrieg into a historical military doctrine with signatures by Liddell Hart and Heinz Guderian
 lidele heart ke itihaas ke dhokhaa dene vaale or "vivaadaaspad" report ko german general erik won manstin or henge guderian ke saath-saath ervin romail ke sambandhiyon or sahyogiyon ko likhe unke patron main dekha ja saktaa he
 In the Guderian to the letter, the latter fabricated the blitzkrieg of the latter, version on Hart Liddell himself, propagating it as the original thread to "impose and force him"
 Historian Kenneth Maxey found Liddell Hart's original letters to Guderian, in the General's documents, urging Guderian to credit him with ideas of his armored fighting skills to "impress him"
 1968 main jab lidele heart se iske bare main or guderian kii smritiyon ke angreji evam german sanskarnon main visangati ko lekar sawaal poocha gaya tha, "unhone ek aasaan suvidhajanak haalanki atyant sachcha jawaab diya
 "
 During World War I, Fuller was a staff officer associated with the newly developed tank army
 baad main unhone vyapak, swatantra tanks opareshnon ke liye yojanaayen viksit kii, jiske liye unhone daawa kiya ki baad main german sena dwaara inkaa adhyayan kiya gaya tha
 It was variously argued that Fuller's wartime plans and post-war compositions were an inspiration, or that his readership was small and that German experiences gained during the war attracted people more
 yuddh ke haare hue paksh ke rup main apane bare main german logon ke nazariye ko varisht or anbhavi adhikariyon se ek sampurna samiksha, adhyayan or unke sabhi sainya siddhanton ke punarlekhan evam prashikshan minial ke jariye joda ja saktaa he
 Britain's response was far weaker
 fuller or lidele heart donon "bahari" the: lidele heart biimaar hone kii vajah se ek sakriy sipaahi ke rup main seva karne main asamarth the or fuller ke sakht vyaktitv kaa parinaam 1933 main samay se pehle unki sevanivritti ke rup main saamne aayaa tha
 Therefore his ideas had limited influence inside the official hierarchy of the British Army
 british yuddh karyaalay ne 1 may 1927 ko tinkon, laurieyukt paidal sena, atmprerit topchi sainikon, motoryukt ejiniyaron se bani ek praayogic yantricrut sena kaa gathan karne kii anumati di thi, lekin vittiya baadhaon ne is prayog ko vistaarit karne se roak diya tha
 It has been argued that Blitzkrieg was not new
 germanon ne 1920 or 1930 ke dashak main blitcraig jaisi kisi cheez kaa avishkaar nahin kiya tha
 Instead, the German concept of a moving and concentrated military force of war can be seen in the Wars of Prussia and the Wars of German Unification
 30 saal ke yuddh ke dauraan, teevr gatividhi, kendrit shakti or ekikrut sainya prayaas ko lagu karne vaale pehle general the, swedish king gustav dwitiya adolfus
 pratham vishwa yuddh main tanks or vimaan kii maujuudagi ko aksar sainya maamalon main krantikari badlaav ) ke rup main dekha jaataa he, jisane german sena ko varisht moltek dwaara prayog kiye gaye paramparaagat yudhak gatividhiyon kii ore waapas jane kaa mauqaa diya tha
 This so-called "blitzkrieg campaign" from 1939 to about 1942 was well within the context of that operation
 yuddh ke failane par german sena ke paas blitcraig kahalaane vaala yaa kuch or kahalaane vaala yuddh kaa koi moulik nayaa siddhant maujuud nahin tha
 The operational thinking of the German Army did not change much after World War I, in fact after the late 19th century
 je
pi
 haris or robert em
 citino bataate hai ki germanon ne hameshaa chote, nirnaayak abhiyaanon ko vishesh praathamikta di thi
 It was just that they could not manage to achieve small-order victories in the circumstances of the First World War
 The difference was, turning the deadlock of World War i into a tremendous early operational and strategic success in the Second World, the appointment of a relatively small number of mechanized divisions, including the appointment of the most important Panzer divisions and an exceptionally powerful Air Force
 Involvement of
 henge guderian ko aam taur par ek aisa sainya siddhant taiyaar karne kaa shrey diya jaataa he jisaki vyakhya baad main blitcraig ke rup main kii gayi thi
 Recently, some people have expressed doubts as to how much of their theory they had
 1920 ke dashak main germany ke sainya sudhaaron ke baad, henge guderian yantricrut sainya balon ke ek prabal prastaavak ke rup main ubhare the
 Inside the transport troops' inspectorate, Guderian and his co-workers took up theoretical and field exercises
 guderian ne yah daawa kiya ki unhen kai aise adhikariyon se virodh kaa saamana karnaa pada tha, jinhone paidal sena ko pradhanta di thi yaa tanks kii upyogita par andeh kiya tha
 Guderian claimed that one of them was the chief of the General Staff, Ladwig Beck, whom he accused of being confused as to whether the armored military force would be decisive
 This claim has been disputed by later historians
 udhaaharan ke liye, james corum ne kaha tha: Guderian expressed heartfelt disdain for General Staff chief Ladwig Beck from 1935 to 1938, whom he described as hostile to the ideas of a modern mechanized combat skill: "wherever he appeared there was a blocking element
 

 unke sochane kaa tarika ladaai kaa unka bahut badha-chadha kar bataane vaala tarika tha, jise unhone vilambit bachaav kaha tha
 It is an impure depiction of a highly capable general who wrote the Army Regulation 300 in 1933, the primary tactical manual of the German Army in World War II, and under whose direction the first three Panzer divisions were created in 1935, Time was the world's largest military force of its kind
 guderian kii ore se badhaai gayi ek or galatafahami ki ve german ranneetik or oparation sambandhi paddati ke ekmaatr nirmaataa the, yah bhi gumraah karne vaali he
 Between 1922 and 1928, Guderian wrote a few articles of barely a page or two about military activities
 guderian ke oktang panjar! ne anya siddhantkaron jaise ki ladwig reter won imensbarger par puraa bharosa kiya tha, jinaki pramukh pustak, da tanks waar ne german army main vyapak pathak varg praapt kiya tha
 Another theorist, Ernst Volkheim, was also used by Guderian and wrote heavily on tank and joint weapons strategies and is not accepted by Guderian
 guderian ke netritv ko rashver general staff pranali main unke samarthakon dwaara samarthan, protsaahan or sansthagat sahyog diya gaya tha, jisane 1930 ke dashak main vyapak or vyavasthit gatividhiyon vaale yudhkaushal yuddhayas ke jariye adhik se adhik str kii kshamta hasil karne main army kii madad kii thi
 Guderian argues that the tank was the deciding weapon of war
 unhone likhaa tha, "agar tanks safal hote the, to jeet uske peeche-peeche aati thi"
 tanks yuddh kaushal ke aalochakon ko sambodhit ek aalekh main unhone likhaa tha "jab tak hamaare aalochak ek safal jamini hamale ke liye aatm-narsanhaar ke atirikt kuch nayaa or behatar tarika ek safal desh aatm - narsanhaar ke alaava anya par hamalaa karne kaa behatar tarika taiyaar nahin karte hai, hamen apni in dharanaon ko aage bhi kaayam rakhana hoga ki tanks - samuchit rup se karyanvit, kehane kii jarurat nahin he ki - aaj jamini hamale ke liye sarvshereshth uplabdh saadhan he
 During World War I, addressing the speed at which defenders could make an area stronger than an attacker could penetrate, Guderian wrote that "because the reserve forces would now be motorized, the new defensive fronts Construction has become much easier than before; the chance of invasion based on the time table of mutual support of artillery troops and infantry, A
 As a result, their positions in the last war are lighter today
 unhone aage kaha, "ham maanate hai ki tinkon se hamalaa karte hue ham ab tak hasil karne yogya dar se kahin ucchtam dar par gatividhi kii kshamta hasil kar sakate hai or - sambhawatah jo kahin adhik mahatvapurn he - ki jab ek baar safalataa hasil ho gayi to ham aage badhate rah sakate hai
 In addition, Guderian felt the need that one tactical radio be used extensively on all tanks to facilitate mutual cooperation and command

 isse kavi kii bahucharchit kritiyaan 'aankh haath banate hue' or 'shabd likhane ke liye hi yah kaagaj bana he' to sampoornataa shaamil hai hi, ab tak asanklit-or anek to aprakashit-rahi aayi kavitaayen bhi pustakaakaar aa rahi he 
 a densely populated poem-world is inviting readers' journey
 gyanendrapati kii in kavitaaon se ek ore to teevr parivartankamita se upja krantikari roman he, varg- shatruon ko lalkaarta yuyutsu udughosh; to duusari ore saamaajik atmalochan kaa vah viral swar he jo apni aatma ko kharad par chadhaaye bagaiyr nahin uthta, apane naitik vivek ke aage vedhya bane rahane par hi jiskaa sfooton sambhav ho paata he 
 Here, there are unforgettable meetings with Chetna Pareek and Banani Banerjee
 raat se lagi bhor main bhatak aayaa chamagadad kaa baccha bhi is kavita-duniya kaa baashinda he 
 Abandoned things are also not meaningless here, new meanings are touched in them
 darasl, gyanendrapati ko padhanaa banate hue itihaas ke bich se guzarana hi nahin, yug ke kolahal ke bheetar se chhan kar aate us mandra swar ko sunanaa he itihaason se jisaki sunwaayee nahin hoti; yah nashvarataaon kii bhashaa se shaashvat kaa beauti-lekh padhanaa he 
 That is why here a kind of roughness becomes a method of poetry-building
 ucch-bhru aalochakon kii parvaa kiye bagaiyr yah manushya kii ore badhaa hua samavyayi haath he 
 These are poems whose life-style unabashedly confirms human life
 kavi ne kaha : gyanendrapati Gyanendrapati is a unique poet-personality of Hindi, the fact is now undisputed
 kavi-karm kaa hi jivan-charya banane vaale gyanendrapati kii pratishtha kaa aadhaar sansthaanon tathaa mahajanon ko sandein or puraskaron kii sankhya nahin balki kavita-premiyon kii priti he, jise unki kavita ne jivan-sangharsh ke morchon par maujuud rahakar or 'abhivyakti ke khatare' uthaakar arjeet kiya he 
 He is one of the few poets whose strength, despite the public's upheavals on the part of poetry, retains the credibility of the meaningful tone of contemporary poetry
 gyanendrapati kii kavita kii apratimata ke karkon main avashya hi yah tathy he ki uski jaden lok kii man-maati main gahare dhansi hai or uski drushti vishwa-chets he 
 Life-melody melds into lyricality in his poetry
 ve kavita ke nahin, us muktand ke kavi hai niraala ne jisaki prastaavna kii thi 
 His poetry is filled with a great scholarly impulse, but its structure is determined by him
 beshak, yah har baar ek naye chand kaa anveshan hai jo kavita ke kathy ke anusaar jivan-dravya ke saath kavi-chitt kii ekaatmata se sambhav hota he 
 Meaningful defamation of the vast linguistic wealth of Hindi has also become very much in their place
 tadbhav-simit rahanaa unki kavita kii majaburi nahin, uske liye na to tatsam achhut he na deshaj asmrishy; avasraanukool naye shabdon ke nirmaan kii uski saahasikta to kukhyat hone kii had tak vikhyath he 
 The poetry of Gyanendrapati makes an effort to save even the smallest truth, the lightest feeling, the joy of the creature itself; Public opinion, on the other hand, stands firmly on the ground against the false truth of power-driven history
 dharmik satta ho yaa raajnneetik satta-vah kisi ko nahin bakhshati 
 He has a plaintive geography
 samrajyabad ke nae pantaron kaa vah pahachaanati he 
 He has inherited compassion in Abhay
 vah ek mahan parampara kii parinti he 
 This compilation of representative poems selected by Gyanendrapati himself is not only from his published collections, poems are also included from dimensional collections, but many are also being published for the first time
 bila shaq apane samaaj-samay ko kavita ko aankh se dekhnaa-samajhnaa chaahane waalon ke liye ek anivaary-kitaab nahin-sahchar! There has been an accident with us in human consciousness journey for centuries
 This is an accident - we emerge as supporters of a particular ideology
 We do not even know and we join a group of 'ideology' and start playing a game of intolerance and terror
 When this battle of favor and opposition has spread deep in every area of civilization - literature, art, music, the claim of a "gyanendrapati" that his favor has merged in favor of his readers is undoubtedly a "gyanendrapati" It remains lonely
 After working as an officer in the Bihar government for almost ten years, Gyanendrapati, who is stuck in the poetry of poetry, renounces everything
 Settled in Aras, then poetry has appeared in various forms
 ateet ke tamas se nikalne kaa daawa karne vaale insaanon kaa jattha prithvi ko apni ungliyon par nachaate hue jab prithvi kii mitti – deh ko parmaanu bam ke bhumigat pareekshan se tharrata he to gyanendrapati bhavishya ke sawaal le kar khadey ho jate hai – "I ask yah prithvi kya keval tumhaari he ? Do you ek kentue ke paas jaakar Earthworms engrossed in fertilizing the Earth nahin poochna chahie Before taking any important decision about the Earth! koun jane, prithvi ke bhavishya ko le, tumse zyada chintit rahati hon chintiyaan ! My status is a earthworm cheentee kii tarah kuchal di jane kii aukaat ho meri tumhaare nikat My human rights are not in front of your charity! main tumhaare liye khet kii muuli hi sahi Come, your own farm - and here, really - is prithvi par meraa adhikaar Not less than you ” jab hamaare andar apane desh, dharm, jati va sabhyataa – samskruti kaa ahankaar sir chadh kar bolne lagata he or ham is khatir marane – maarane ko utaaru hote hai tabhi hamen yah dikhnaa band ho jaataa he ki hamaare bich kii kuch pyaari paramparaayen dam tod rahi hai
 hamaare jivan se “ramlila” kaa pardaa dekhte – dekhte hameshaa ke liye gir gaya or vishesh kar us daur main jab “ram bhakt” ramshilaon ke saath ramrath nikaal rahe the
 “ramlila” ke avsaan kii pidaa kaa ahsaas “he ram” kii kuch panktiyon main saaf dikhataa he – "ramrath was coming out, he was breaking the country like ramshilaayein apane giddh – pankh fadakaatin gaanvon main utar rahi thim And there, unseen mar rahi thim ramlilaayen The month-long Ramlilaas in the village xxrep 12 
 xxrep 22 
 aise main They ram ko apane ram – baan main badal diya tha They did not mind that Ramleela was dying kyonki valmiki or tulsi se zyada unke kaam aa sakate the ramanand sagar
” The compositions of Gyanendrapati create a new world of sensation beyond the defined limits of words and grammar and nothing untouchable in this world
 His creation is life-raga in the world, the fragrance of the soil in the breath and the ability to penetrate the so-called global events / accidents in the eyes
 Instead of capturing the poem in the mask of a costume, they give it a free space and typical indigenous words create a unique charm in their poems
 The same rude nature of Gyanendrapati and standing in opposition to the hypocrisy of the so-called public opinion annoys the mandarins
 In his own words - "I fall like a gritty in the eyes of contemporary writers of literature, that's fine
" Referring to the attacks of monks and so-called policy controllers in the field of literature, he says - “khesadi daal kii tarah nindit Will be uprooted bhartiya kavita ke kshetra se because now itihaas kii gati ke bharose na baith There is a technique to change the way of history kho jaaounga The way it is lost bataloi main daal churne kii sugandh In most homes " kitabgar prakaashan, nayi dilli se prakashit “kavi ne kaha” main gyanendrapati kii hridayasparshi kavitaaon kaa ek puraa range he, jisaki tamaam kavitaayen purv main prakashit sankalnon – “sanshayatma”, “gangatat”, “shabd likhane ke liye hi yah kaagaj bana he” aadi se lee gayi hai to saath hi kuch pehali baar prakashit hui hai
 smriti kaa ek anokhaa prakatikaran “tram main ek yaad” ke rup main hua he – "chetna Pareek, how are you?" pehle jaisi ho ? Some happy kuch – kuch udhaas Ever seen stars kabhi dekhati ghaas Chetna Pareek, what do you look like? ab bhi kavita likhti ho ? xxrep 10

 There is less of a laughter in the Mahathas of the city virat dhak – dhak main ek dhadkan kam he, kores main ek kanth kam he Your two floors take up as much space as you can vahaan ugi he ghaas vahaan chui he os vahaan kisi ne nigaah tak nahin daali he i have come again in this city to wipe glasses aadamiyon ko, kitabon ko nirakhata lekhata hoon Colored Bus - Tram, Colored - Colored People rog – shok hansee – kushi yoga or viyog i see that the city is crowded dekhtaa hoon tumhaare aakaar ke baraabar jagah suuni he Chetna Pareek, where are you? bolo, bolo, pehle jaisi ho !” In a rapidly changing world, our habits and allegiance are changing so fast that we do not even know
 The release of books from our lives is one such change, but Gyanendrapati mentions the risks associated with this change in "watch Television" - “ xxrep 9 
 Book is a dangerous thing aadmi ke haathon main uske jate hi Sultanate finds wobble xxrep 9

 ” Although, long before the arrival of the twenty-first century, we started beating the drum of the new century and our scientific thinking
 We have no control over the cycle, so the new century came down to earth at the right time without delay of a second; But our thinking? How our thinking can use the new age scientific inventions to spread its superstition, a good illustration of this is in the "day" when the whole of India was feeding the Ganesh idol - “sanchaar – kranti ke is yug main Superstition is also transmitted quickly, of course! andhashraddha ! Whose blinding city of Nahey hairat se khuli – khuli aankhe bhi She was shaved inside us din” On the one hand, our devout psyche is feeding milk to Ganesha in the infinite stream of development, on the other hand, seeing the progressive India on the plight of the Ganges, which has been witness to our survival journey since time immemorial, the pain of the mind spontaneously appears in the "river and soap" - “nadi ! Why are you so thin or maili – kuchaili Why have the fish landed like dead tumhaare durdinon ke durjal main xxrep 14 
 xxrep 20 
 Ahh ! but swaarthee kaarkaanon kaa tejabi peshaab jhelte Your beautiful skin turned purple himalay ke hote bhi tumhaare sirahaane Palm-filled soapbox haar gayin tum yuddh ! It is said that the excesses of condolences come down on paper in the form of poetry and if the writing is in the hands of Gyanendrapati, then the infinite journey of sensation is also possible
 Previously published poem compilation "this paper is made for writing words", the poem "blessing" compiled takes us on a similar journey - “ve tumhen shishu nahin rahane denge They will break your days with you ve un titliyon ko Will free you xxrep 11 
 xxrep 16 
 ve tumhaari gandi kameezon ko Will reveal or jhak – jhak dhuli maand – si mahakati bardiyaan Will wear ve tumhaare bujurg hai They are blessing you to grow up unke rathon ke ghode thak gaye hai In today's "face Book Round", when there is a fashion to quote poetry for some "likes", Gyanendrapati stands in front of a clean mirror
 If you are willing to take the risk, have the ability to know and face your truth, then you can stand in front of that mirror; But this will be your own decision - i am not taking any kind of guarantee

 Four of his films also received Oscar awards in the foreign language film category
 felini kaa janm italy main adriatic sagar ke kinare remini naam ke ek chote se shahar ke ek madhyamvargeey parivaar main hua tha
 His father Urbano Fellini was from a middle-class peasant family, while his mother, Ida Barbiani, belonged to a wealthy Roman business family
 felini kii praarambhik shiksha-diksha remini main hi hui
 Fellini was a talented student
 ve apane fursat ke pal kaa upyog rekhachitr banane, patrikaayen padhane or kathputli kala kaa pradarshan karne main karte the
 During the reign of Benito Mussolini, Fellini along with his younger brother Ricardo also became a member of Avogardista, a mandatory fascist organization for youth
 1933 main unhone apane mata-pita ke saath pehali baar rome kaa bhraman kiya
 This was the year when Italy's famous seaplane SS Rex embarked on its first voyage across the Atlantic
 is jahaaj kaa drishy felini ne apni film amarcord main filmaaya he
 In 1937 Fellini, together with the painter Demod Bonini, opened a portrait-making studio as well as started making cartoons for various letter magazines
 haalanki felini kaa man adhyayan se ub rahaa tha lekin unhone apane mata-pita kii prasannataa ke liye rome vishvavidhyalay ke lau skool main daakhila le liya
 During his studies in Rome, Fellini began working as a reporter in newspapers named Piccolo and Pipolo di Roma
 lekin adalati kaarywahi kii khabaren likhane se unka man jald hi uchat gaya
 He then started working for a weekly magazine called Mark Aurelio and within four months of the publication of his first article in the magazine, he was added to the editorial board
 is patrika main unka bat aar you licening ? naam se sthaayee stambh chapana shuru ho gaya
 This was the period in Fellini's life when he came in contact with Rome's filmmakers and screenwriters while working for the magazine and eventually opted for film career and screenwriting
 mark aurelio ke liye kaam karte hue felini ne radio roopak ke saath film samikshaayen bhi likhnaa shuru kar diya
 Fellini first got the job of writing comedic dialogues in the Italian filmmaker Mario Mattoli's film Pirata Sono Io in 1940
 iske baad felini ne kabhi peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 Fellini had witnessed the horrors of World War II and became anti-war
 felini prasiddh filmkaar roberto roselini ke sampark main aae or unke sahaayak ban gaye
 In 1946, he worked as an assistant director with the writer in Rosellini's film Pesa and l'amour
 yahi wo daur tha jab wo namchin adaakaar marcelo mastriyani or alberto letuada ke sampark main aae or unke ghanisht mitra ban gaye
 In 1950, Fellini collaborated with Alberto Letuada to produce a film called Lucy del Verieta, which failed miserably, and Fellini was in debt with her friend
 lekin isi dauraan roselini kii film pasa main patakatha ke liye roselini sergio emide ke saath felini ko auskar puraskaar mil gaya
 But despite this, Fellini did not have quick success
 unki shuruaati filmon ko film samikshakon ne sire se khaarij kar diya
 Even Michelangelo Antonioni, after reading the script of his first film White Sheik as a director, did not find it worth making the film
 lekin 1953 main unki film vitteloni ko samikshakon or darshakon ne dil kholkar saraahaa
 The film received the Silver Lion Award at the Venice Film Festival
 patakatha lekhak or film nirdeshak ke rup main felini ne adholikhit filmon main kaam kiya he: Fellini influenced his contemporaries with his completely different filmmaking style
 felini kaa shuruyaat main rujhaan navayatharthwaad kii ore tha lekin baad main apni filmon main phantasy kaa prayog nae bimbon or pratikon ko gadhane main kiya
 In his films we can see the wishes, taboos, dreams and fantasies of an entire European generation
 angareji bhashaa main paaparaji shabd kaa chalan felini kaa film laa dolche vita se chalan main aayaa
 So we can easily see Fellini's influence on the films of filmmakers Tim Burton and David Lynch

 Since 1400 AD, the use of this device has increased tremendously in navigation, navigation and navigation
 navik diksuchak atyadhik samay tak bade hi aprishkrut yantra the1 1820 isvi main barlo ne chaar paanch samaantar chumbakon se yukt ek patrak kaa sutarapaat kiya
 In 1876, Sir William Tomson produced his dry sheet compass
 san 1882 main dravadiksuchak kaa nirmaan hua
 There are mainly four types of compasses: chumbakeey diksuchak - yah nideshak bal praapt karne ke liye prithvi ke chumbakeey kshetra par nirbhar karata he
 Rotating compass - it receives its director force from the rotation of the earth
 radio diksuchak - isaki karypranali betaar siddhant par aadhaarit he
 Sun or star compass - its use depends on the Sun or any star being visible
 chumbakeey diksuchak kshaitij disha gyaat karne kaa yantra he
 The simple form of this device is a magnetic needle, which is balanced on a mortise so that it is free to rotate in the horizontal direction of the Earth's magnetic field
 "samaan dhruvon main paraspar pratikarshan or asmaan dhruvon main paraspar aakarshan hota he', yahi chumbakeey diksuchak kaa siddhant he
 Accordingly, a magnetic needle hanging freely from its center of gravity points north and south across the horizontal plane, as the horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic field acts on it
 isamen nimnlikhit trutiyaan pai jaati hai : 1
 Variance - This is the angle between the geometric meridian and the magnetic meridian, depending on the position of the compass
 vastav main, diksuchak kii sui thik uttar kii ore sanket nahin karti
 As a result, there is an error in the reading of the compass, which is called navigational variance and scientist problem
 yah chumbakeey paryvekshanon dwaara gyaat kiya jaataa he or saraniyon ke rup main prakashit kar diya jaataa he
 2
 Deviations - This second type of error, called deviation, is caused by local magnetic effects in the reading of the magnetic meridian and compass
 diksuchakadhaani main lohe ke tukade or trutipurak chumbak lagane se, yah truti yathasambhav dur kar di jaati he
 a table is displayed showing the residual deviation
 prayek vichlansaarini ek vishesh diksuchak sansthaapan ke liye hi prayukt hoti he
 This magnetic compass is more complex and precise than an ordinary device
 is yantra ke paanch mukhya bhaag hote hai : patrak, chumbakeey suiyaan, ratnit topi, kilak tathaa katoraa
 The gemstone cap is attached at the center of the sheet and various magnetic needles are attached at the bottom of the sheet
 patrak or suiyon kii yah sampurna vyavastha, katore ke andar ek kendriya kilak par aropi is prakaar santulit rahati he ki chaahe pot kii sthiti main kitna bhi parivartan ho jaae, diksuchak patrak sadaiv kshaitij avasthaa main rahata he
 a compass sheet is a horizontal circular disk of paper or asbestos
 yah patrak, spasht rup se pradhan digbinduon, uttar, purv, dakshin or pashchim, main chinhit rahata he
 The central point of the mid-point of these points is North East, North West, South East and South West
 inke madhya main bhi ardhabindu or chaturth bindu ankit hote hai
 Thus, on the edge of the old compass sheet, 32 points are marked in the direction and the difference between them is equal
 aadhunik diksuchak patrak par, uttar se aarambh karke, dakshinavart disha main 0rou se lekar 360rou tak ke chinh ankit hote hai
 After finding the northern direction by the compass, there is a need to find the angle between the vehicle's northern direction and the direction of its intended path
 diksuchak dwaara gyaat kii hui kisi lakshya kii disha uskaa dikman kehalaati he
 Dikman is represented in degrees in the same way as angles in geometry
 yah chumbakeey diksuchak kaa hi ek prakaar he or vishwa upyog kii vastu ho gaya he
 It has a simple rotating arrangement of magnet copperplate bracket, sapphire cap and mica sheet
 katoraa asut jal or 35 pratishat alcohal ke mishran se bharaa hota he
 This device is immersed in liquid

 The French Revolution was a period of political and social upheaval and radical changes in the history of France that lasted from 1789 to 1799
 baad main, nepolian bonapart ne francisi samrajya ke vistaar dwaara kuch ansh tak is kranti ko aage badhaayaa
 As a result of the revolution, the king was removed from the throne, a republic was established, bloody conflicts took place, and finally the dictatorship of Napoleon was established, which spread many values of this revolution in and outside Western Europe
 is kranti ne aadhunik itihaas kii disha badal di
 This led to the decline of the absolute monarchy around the world, new republics and liberal democracies
 aadhunik yug main jin mahaparivartanon ne paashchaatya sabhyataa ko hilaa diya usamen france kii rajyakranti sarvaadhik naatakeey or jatil sabit hui
 This revolution disrupted the life of not only France but the whole of Europe

 This revolution also led to freedom in other European countries and other countries also started fighting for freedom from the monarchy
 isane europea rashtron sahit asian deshon main rajshahi or nirankushta ke khilaaf vaataavaran taiyaar kiya
 France had an autocratic monarchy based on the divine principle of kingship

 In the reign of Louis the 14th, autocracy was at its zenith
 usne kaha- "main hi rajya hoon"
 He made laws against his will
 usne shakti kaa atyadhik kendriyakaran rajtantr ke paksh main kar diya
 France expanded by diplomacy and military prowess
 is tarah usne rajtantr ko gambhir pesha banaaya
 The governance that Louis 14th centralized required a worthy king, but his successors Louis 15th and Louis 16th were completely inept
 lui 15waan atyant vilaasi, adoordarshee or niskriy shaasha tha
 Participated in Austria's succession war and the Seven Year War caused great damage to the country's economic condition

 He was an indolent and unworthy ruler

 He said that "this thing is legal because i want it
" " apane ek mantri ke tyaagptr ke samay usne kaha ki-kaash! main bhi tyaagptr de paata
 His wife Mary Antoniet had a great influence on him
 vah phijulkharchi karti thi
 He had no understanding of the troubles of the common man
 ek baar jab logon kaa juluus roti kii maang kar rahaa tha to usne salaah di ki yadi roti uplabdh nahin he to log kek kyon nahin khate
 In this way the governance system of the country was completely dependent on bureaucracy
 jo vanshanugat thi
 There were no rules for their recruitment and training and there was no institution that could control these bureaucrats
 is tarah shashan pranali puri tarah bhrasht, nirankush, niskriy or shoshankari thi
 The law of personal law and the will of the king applied
 faltah desh main ek samaan kanoon samhita kaa abhaav tathaa vibhinn kshetron main vibhinn kanoonon kaa prachlan tha
 Due to this chaotic and complicated law, the public did not have knowledge of their own law
 is avyavasthit nirankush tathaa samvedansheel shashan tantra kaa astitv janata ke liye kshtdaayi ban gaya
 These oppressive political circumstances gave way to revolution
 france kii arajakpurna sthiti ke baaren main you kaha ja saktaa he ki "buree vyavastha kaa to koi prashn nahin, koi vyavastha hi nahin thi
 " kranti ke kaarnon ko saamaajik paristhitiyon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 French society was heterogeneous and disintegrated
 vah samaaj teen virgon / stats main vibhakt tha
 The clergy in the first states, the nobility in the second states and the general public in the third states
 padri evam kuleen varg ko vyapak visheshadhikaar praapt tha jabaki jansadharan adhikaar viheen tha
 The number of farmers was the highest and their condition was low and thoughtful
 kisaanon ko rajya, carch tathaa anya jamidaaron ko anek prakaar ke kar dene padate the or saamanti atyaachaari ko sahanaa padataa tha
 In a sense, the main reason for the dissatisfaction of the farmers was the hardships and inconveniences being given by the feudal lords and the monarchy was silent on it
 is tarah kisaan itane duhkhi ho chuke the ki ve swayan hi ek krantikari tatv ke rup main parinat ho gaye or unhen kranti karne ke liye maatr ek sanket kii aavashyaktaa thi
 The middle class consisted of moneylender merchants, teachers, lawyers, doctors, writers, artists, employees etc
 unki aarthik dasha main avashya thik thi phir bhi ve tatkaaleen raajnneetik, saamaajik or aarthik paristhitiyon ke prati acroshit the
 This class had no political authority and the behavior of the clergy and the nobility was not good towards them
 is kaaran madhyavarg kulinon ke saamaajik shreshthata se ghrinaa rakhte tha or raajnneetik vyavastha main parivartan kar apane adhikaron ko praapt karne ke icchhuk tha
 This was the reason that he was the main contributor to the French Revolution and he led the revolution
 madhyavarg ke kuch aarthik shikaayatein bhi thi
 Due to the erstwhile commerce trade, this class had acquired wealth, but now in the feudal environment, there were many restrictions on their trade and had to pay tax in place
 ve apane vyapaar vyavsaay ke liye unmukt vaataavaran chaahate the
 For this, he led the revolution
 is tarah ham kah sakate hai ki france kii kranti francisi samaaj ke do paraspar virdohi guton ke sangharsh kaa parinaam thi
 On the one hand there were influential groups from the political point of view and on the other side from the economic point of view
 desh kii raajnneeti or sarkaar par prabhutv kaayam karne ke liye in donon virgon main sangharsh anivaary tha
 Thus the French Revolution of 1789 was a struggle against inequality in French society
 france kii aarthik avasthaa sankatagrast thi
 The state was on the verge of bankruptcy
 vastutah france ke raajaaon kii phijulkharchi tathaa lui 14wein ke lagaataar yudhon ke kaaran shahi kosh khaali ho gaya tha
 After his death, Louis 15th participated in the Austrian succession war and the Seven Year War, which further increased the burden on the treasury and eventually Louis 16th made France's economic condition worse by participating in the American War of Independence

 The palace of Versailles became a means of looting the treasury

 Due to privileges, the rich class was exempt from tax and the poor farmer who was economically poor was the only taxpayer
 is tarah rajkosh kii sthiti atyant sochneey ho gai thi
 In France, the government fixed income according to expenditure rather than spending according to income
 rajya rin ke boj tale dabta gaya
 Whether France was unable to pay the interest of the principal money means that the state had reached a state of bankruptcy

 Louis 16th tried to overcome the economic crisis through financial advisors like the Turks, Necker but these reform efforts could not be implemented because the privileged class did not accept the taxation on themselves

 In the context of the role of philosophers in the French Revolution, two opinions emerge - one, the philosophers created the revolution by giving rise to the circumstances of the revolution and secondly the source of the revolution was in the faults of the national life of that time and in the mistakes of the government and The philosophers did not produce a revolution
 kisi bhi mat par nirnay dene ke purv un darshanikon ke vichaaron or kranti ke saath unke sambandhon ko samajhnaa vaanchhneeya hoga
 The determination of the popularity of the ideas of philosophers should be seen on the basis of the volumes and prevalence of the articles printed at that time
 montescue ne apni pustak 'da spirit of loj' main raja ke daivi adhikaron ke siddhanton kaa khandan kiya or francisi raajnneetik sansthaaon kii aalochana hi nahin ki varan vikalp bhi prastut kiya
 He wrote that the French government is an autocratic government because in France all the powers related to executive, judiciary and legislature are concentrated in the hands of one person ie the king, so the French people do not have freedom
 isi sadanrbh main usne “shakti ke pruthakkaran” kaa siddhanth diya jiske anusaar shashan ke teen pramukh ang-karypalika, nyaaypalik or vyavasthapika ko alag-alag haathon main rakhane kii salaah di
 He described the Government of England as ideal because there was a constitutional monarchy whereby the citizens were at liberty there
 is prakaar montescue ne shakti ke pruthakkaran ke madhyam se france kii nirankush raaj vyavastha par chot kii uske ye vichaar itane lokapriy hue ki 'da spirit of laaj' ke teen varshon main chah sanskaran prakashit hue
 It is to be noted here that Montescue neither talked of revolution nor the abolition of the monarchy, he just exposed the faults of autocratic monarchy and talked about constitutional monarchy
 waltare ne apni pustakon ke letters on inglish madhyam se britain kii udaar raajnneeti, dharm or vichaar swatantraaa kaa vishad chithran kiya tathaa puraatan francisi vyavastha se uski tulana kii or france main vyaapt buraaiyon evam kamiyon kaa ullekh kiya
 These books became very popular before being banned
 “waltare” ne carch ke bhrasht achaaran, ashishnutaa, anyaay, daman or atyaachaar ke virodh main likhaa
 Pointing fingers at the corruption of the church, he wrote that there is no Christian left because there was only one Christian and he was crucified
 usne likhaa ki kukhyat evam badnaam cheez ko kuchal do
 This was clearly an attack on the tyrannical monarchy of France and the tyranny of the Church
 waltare england ke sanvaidhanik rajtantr ke anuroop hi france main bhi vaisaa hi shashan sthapit karnaa chahta tha
 He said that i prefer the rule of one lion in place of hundred mice

 He exposed the evils of the ancient French system
 usne logon ke samaksh tatkaaleen francisi samaaj kaa aaina prastut kiya or yah bataaya ki aaina main daag kaha he
 Russo talked about the freedom of man through his book "emily", "social Contract", "rusoni"
 isane kaha ki manushya swatantrat paidaa hote hue bhi sarvatra zanjeeron se jakadaaa hua
 The only way to get rid of these chains is to return to the natural primitive state
 ruson ne kaha ki samuhik ichha se bane rajya kaa yah anivaary tathaa saarvbhaum kartavya he ki vah saare samaaj ko sarvopari maanate hue kaary ko sanchalit karen
 The people who have been entrusted with executive power are the executive, not the owner of the people, and their duty is to obey the orders of the people
 is tarah uskaa drudh vishwaas tha ki sarvopari satta janata ke haath main honi chahie kisi kisi ek vyakti yaa sanstha ke haath main nahin
 Sovereign power is rooted in the will of the people which is called "common will"
 rajya ke kanoon ko isi saamaanya ichha kii abhivyakti honi chahie lekin kanoon kaa swaroop aisa nahin rah gaya he, balki yah shaasha kii ichha par nirbhar rahane laga he
 The Russians also did not talk of revolution but considered all people as free and equal and the slogans of the French Revolution were influenced by his ideas of freedom, equality and fraternity
 nepolian ne uske mahatv ko sweekaar karte hue kaha ki yadi ruson nahin hota to france main kranti nahin hoti
 The popularity of the Russian social contract can be gauged from the fact that 13 editions were published in a year
 18veen shatabdi ke shreshth vichaarkon kii rachanaaon ko sankalit kar aam janata tak pahunchane kaa shrey francisi vidwaan didaro ko diya jaataa he isane ek gyaan kosh kaa prakaashan kiya
 In this, evils of governance, corruption of the church and inequality prevailing in every field were highlighted
 france kii sarkaar ne didaron ko apana ghor shatru mana or uski pustak par anek pratibandh lagaae
 a section of thinkers was focused on the economic disorder and analysis prevailing in France at this time

 Prominent among them were the Turgans, the Quessanes, the Mirabs, etc

 The nobles hoped that in this meeting they would be able to obtain the privileges which were taken away at the time of Louis 14th
 madhyavarg ke logon kaa manaan tha ki ve apane paksh main pragatisheel nitiyon kaa nirdhaaran karvaa sakenge
 The farmers hoped that by raising their voice against feudal privileges, they would be able to secure their rights and be free from their exploitation cycle
 is tarah francisi rajtantr kaa samarthan karne ke liye francisi jansankhya kaa koi mahatvapurn bhaag taiyaar nahin tha
 In the session of the Estates General, there was a dispute between the third state and other states on the issue of voting system
 matdaan ke bare main kaha gaya ki prayek state kaa ek hi mat mana jayega
 In this way, the privileged class has two and the public has only one opinion
 jansadharan ke pratinidhiyon ne arthath 'tritiy state' ne is matdaan pranali kaa virodh kiya kyonki isse ve bahut main hote hue bhi alpamat main aa jate
 The third state wanted the representatives of the three categories to sit together and decide by majority, but the clergy and the elite wanted separate meetings
 atah tritiy state ne stats general kii baithak kaa bahishkaar kar apane ko samast raashtra kaa pratinidhi maanate hue rashtriya sabha ke rup main ghoshit kar diya or paas ke tennis court main apni sabha bulaai
 The French Revolution reached its end through various stages
 adhyayan kii suvidha kii drushti se kranti ko nimnlikhit chaar charnon main baantkar dekha ja saktaa he
 At this stage the Parisian mob established control of the Bastille fort
 is tarah kranti kii shuruuaat hui
 In fact, the Bastille fort was a symbol of tyranny and tyranny and its fall posed a deep challenge to the archaic system
 is ghatana kaa prabhaav france ke gramin kshetron main bhi padaa or graminon ne saamanti karon ke abhilekhon ko aag laga di
 These proceedings of the public also had a profound impact on the National Assembly
 atah 4 agast 1789 jo raat bhar kaa rashtriya sabha kaa adhiveshan chalaa jisamen kanoon nirmit karke sabhi visheshadhikaron ko samaapt kar diya
 Thus England and America were abolished
 rashtriya sabha kaa mahatvapurn kaary tha- ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan karnaa
 Therefore, the National Assembly was called the Constituent Assembly and on 26 August 1789, the Constituent Assembly declared human rights
 samvidhan sabha ne apane aadarshon tathaa uddeshyon ke rup main maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 This declaration emphasized the principle of equality and it was said that since all human beings are born equal, they should get equal rights
 in adhikaron main swatantraaa, sampatti suraksha tathaa atyaachaar ke virodh kaa adhikaar aadi shaamil the
 In this way, the Constituent Assembly declared the fundamental principles, freedom, equality and dominance of the people
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko ghoshnaa patr main baar-baar duharaaya gaya
 No one could be denied this right
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne carch kii sampatti ko jabt kar liya or janata par carch ke niyantran ko kam karne kaa prayaas kiya
 In this context, the Church was brought under the Kingdom and was transformed from the influence of the Pope of Rome into a National Church
 rajya ke prati padariyon kii vafadari surakshit karne ke liye "civil constichution of cllerji" banaaya gaya
 According to which the priests had to take an oath of allegiance to the state and they were elected by the public
 pope or kuch padariyon ne is kadam kaa virodh kiya
 The clergy who swore allegiance to the state were called "jurors" while those who did not take the oath were called "non-jurors"
 is kanoon se kranti ke viruddh ek maahaul nirmit hone laga kyonki abhi tak chote padariyon ne kranti kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Now they broke away from it and some clergy left the country and went abroad and started campaigning against the revolution in Europe there
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne france ke liye likhit sanvadhin taiyaar kiya or is samvidhan ko 1791 main lui solahaven ne apni sweekruti de di
 The Constitution emphasizes two things - one, the sovereign power of the state is vested in the people and second, the separation of power is in the interest of the state and the people
 yadhyapi shashan pranali rajtantratmak bani raheen parantu raja ke adhikaron ko simit kiya gaya
 He is no longer a lawmaker
 raja ko kisi desh se yuddh yaa sandhi karne kaa adhikaar nahin tha
 The authority to legislate was given to an assembly and its members numbered 745
 vyavasthapika ke sadasyon ke nirvachan ke liye nagarikon ko sakriy or nishkray do bhaagon main vibhakt kar diya gaya or matadhikaar keval sakriy nagarikon ko diya gaya
 Active citizens were those over the age of 25 who paid the state direct tax equal to three days' income while inactive citizens were those who were poor
 rashtriya sabha ne france kii prashasnic sanrachana main parivartan kiya
 The entire country was divided into 83 departments by abolishing the ancient provinces
 in departmenton ko Cantan or Comune main baanta gaya
 There was an Election Council to run the rule of each of the units, which were elected by active citizens
 is tarah sthaneey str se lekar kendriya str tak sari rajya vyavastha bargea varg main aa gai
 After the dissolution of the National Assembly, in 1791 AD, a 745-member administrative body came into existence
 is vyavasthapika sabha main adhyaksh ke daahine haath kii ore baithne vaale 'dakshinpanthi' kehalaae
 These people were orthodox and supportive of the monarchy, while those on the left were called 'leftists' and this group was of the original changeists who were radical and revolutionary
 radicals bhi do virgon main bante the- jirondist or doosraa jacobiyan
 Meanwhile, the fear of the French Revolution started spreading to other countries of Europe
 jo padri evam kuleen varg france se bhaag europe ke anya kshetron ke chale gaye the unhone kranti ke viruddh bhaavana failaai
 On the other hand, French revolutionaries wanted to propagate revolutionary principles in other countries as well
 faltah europe ke anya raja shankit hue
 As a result, the relations between revolutionary France and other countries of Europe deteriorated
 austria ne krantikariyon ke manaa karne par bhi france ke rajtantr ke samarthak sharnaarthiyon ko apane yahaan rahane diya tha
 Therefore, in April 1792, the Legislative Assembly declared war against Austria, but the French army was badly defeated
 is paraajay se france kii janata ko vishwaas ho gaya ki raja ne austria ko france kii sainya shakti or suraksha ke saare bhed bataa die hai
 Hence the public's attitude towards the king became fierce
 in sthitiyon main francisi rajtantr ke samarthan main prasha or austria ne ghoshnaa kii ki france kii janata raja kii ajna kaa paalan kare anyathaa ham unke viruddh kaarywahi karenge
 In this way the French Revolution created a war situation in Europe
 is ghoshnaa se france kii janata or ugr ho gai or usne raja ko gher liya
 The king escaped and took refuge in the assembly
 ab yah vichaar kiya jane laga ki vyavasthapika sabha bhang kii jaae; punah chunaav ho, nayi vyavasthapika sabha bane or vah rajtantr ke bhavishya par apana nirnay de
 With this, the assembly was abolished and a national convention was formed on the basis of adult suffrage
 21 sintabar 1792 ko neshnal kanveshan kaa pratham adhiveshan hua
 The Jacobian and Jirodist parties were prominent in this
 jacobiyan anushaasit or sangathit the
 He had influence on the Parisian crowd
 isamen pramukh netaa the- dante, robspier, heater aadi
 On the other side there were jirondists - these were educated and cultured people
 inhen kitaabi gyaan adhik tha
 As a result, they were not practical politicians
 pramukh netaa the- isnar, madam rolland, briso aadi
 It is to be understood here that both factions were advocates of the Republic, supporting the war against foreign powers
 antar keval swaroop kaa tha
 In fact, Jirodisto took a liberal position in France
 unka maananaa tha kii kranti bahut aage ja chuki he or uskaa ant hona chahie
 They were against bringing more social equality
 ve swatantraaa par adhik jor dete the
 On the other hand, the Jacobians emphasized more on equality and had a harmonious attitude towards the lower classes
 neshnal kanvension ke saamne teen pramukh samasyaayein thi- videshi akraman, raja kii maujuudagi or grihayuddh
 In September 1792, the French army occupied Belgium and in the south Nees and Savoy also came under its control
 in vijayon se holland, austria, prasha or england ghabara gaye
 The revolutionaries also declared in 1792 that the Republic of France was based on feelings of freedom, equality and fraternity, and it was their duty to spread these feelings
 france jin jagahon par aadhipatay kaayam karegaa vahaan krantikari siddhanton ko lagu karegaa or padariyon or kulinon kii sampatti chin legaa or jo bhi desh iskaa virodh karegaa use kranti kaa shutra samaj jayega
 The autocratic monarchy countries of Europe were frightened by this announcement and now the revolution of France turned to the whole of Europe, not France
 atah europea desh kranti ke prasar ko rokane ke liye ekajute ho gaye or england, holland, austria, prasha ke ek gut kaa france ke viruddh nirmaan hua
 This group defeated France in many places
 faltah videshi yuddh main france kii paraajay neshnal kanveshan ke samaksh ek mukhya samasya ban gai
 The National Convention passed a resolution that abolished the monarchy and established the republic
 raja par deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya gaya or mrityudand kii sajaa di gai
 The policy of the Jirendistas on the question of the slaughter of the king was not clear
 ve rajtantr ke virdohi to the lekin vadh ke prashn par janamat sangrah kii baat kar rahe the
 In contrast, the Jacobians believed that the king's treason had been proved
 atah use mrityudand diya janaa chahie
 Finally, on 16 January 1793, Louis 16th was hanged
 neshnal kanvension ko jacobiyan or jirodishton ke bich sangharsh kii samasya kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa
 In fact, France was beset by an economic crisis due to war, with prices soaring that the Convention enacted legislation to provide relief, a rule to collect debt from the rich
 in kadamon kaa jirondixton ne virodh kiya
 When Jacobio invaded the Convention with the help of the Paris mob and the commune, he took power and arrested Jirondisto and established a state of terror
 'aatank ke rajya' kii sthapana ke saath hi france ek baar punah avyavashtha kaa shikaar hua
 It was founded under the leadership of Robspier
 isamen krantikari, jansuraksha kii sthapana kii gai thi or jo koi jaikabins ke viruddh kaam karata use mrityudand kii sajaa di jaati
 Robespierre was influenced by the ideology of the Russians

 Robespierre put opponents on the "guillotine" to control power
 atah sabhi vyakti apane jivan ko lekar sashankit ho uthe
 Finally in July 1794, Robespierre was imprisoned and hanged, ending the reign of Terror
 aantak ke rajya ke baad 'thermidorian kii pratikriya' hui
 Liberal Thermidorian leaders took over the power of the country and dissolved the militant state systems, declaring the Jacobians illegal
 aantak ke shashan ke dauraan lagaae gaye mulya tathaa paarishramik par se niyantran uthaa liya gaya
 Due to which the prices rose again, the influence of speculators increased and the rebellions in response, but these rebels were suppressed

 The rights of all the members of the board were equal
 prayek sadsy baari-baari se teen maheene ke liye adhyaksh hua karte the
 Each year a member term was to end and another member was to be appointed instead
 is tarah neshnal kanvension ke baad france main diarectory kaa shashan shuru hua jo 1795 se 1799 tak chalaa
 Hence, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule
 diarectory kaa yah shashan avyavasthit, dukhamay rahaa
 The Board of Directors was empowered to control the Armed Forces and to appoint Chiefs of Army, to make treaties or to wage war on behalf of France
 sanchaalak mandal ke saamne sabase pramukh samasya thi yuddh kii samasya, duusari taraf diarectory ke sadsy anubhavheen, ayogy tathaa bhrasht the
 Therefore, during the rule of the directory, various kinds of disturbances spread, unemployment increased, trade was halted and its foreign policy was also weak
 aisi sthiti main france kii janata ek aise shaasha kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kar rahi thi jo desh ke andar or baahar shanti sthapit kar sake tathaa videshi shaktiyon ko parrast kar sake
 During this period Napoleon established the honor of France by military victories and eventually ended the rule of the Directory and established control of power
 1799 main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kiya or france kaa pratham counsal bana or 1804 i

 France is the only country in Europe that has ensured the collapse of the archaic system through revolution
 is kranti kaa prabhaav europe tak hi simit na rahaa
 It affected the whole world
 kranti ke naare swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kaa prasar puure europe main hua
 On the one hand, while it gave opportunity to new powers like nationalism, democraticism to flourish, on the other hand it also laid the foundation of modern dictatorship and militarism
 francisi kranti ke prabhaavon ko nimna binduon ke tahat samajha ja saktaa haih The nature of the French Revolution needs to be understood in light of the ideals of the revolution, the leadership of the revolution, the progress of the revolution, the changes brought during the revolution and the effects on the world
 is drushti se kranti ek aisi kranti thi jiskaa prarambh to kuleen varg ne kiya, phir aage chalakar iskaa netritv madhyavarg ke haathon main aayaa
 It remained under the influence of revolutionary elements for some time and ended with a military dictator
 is tarah francisi kranti us vishaal nadi kii tarah jo ucch parvat shikhar se prarambh hokar maarg main anek chote-mote parvaton ko laanghti hui kabhi teevr gati se, to mand gati se pravaahman rahi
 The French Revolution of 1789 can be seen as a bourgeois revolution

 The middle class leadership should also formulate some principles keeping in mind personal property

 Middle class influence can be seen in the Declaration of Human Rights
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko manushya ke naiysargik adhikaron kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya jo burjua hiton ke sangrakshan se sambandhit he
 Similarly, adult suffrage was talked about, but in the Constitution the word "citizen" was used in a very narrow sense
 naagarik ko sakriy va niskriy nagarikon main vibhajit kiya gaya
 Active citizens were those who paid at least three days' income as direct taxes and only had the right to vote
 pratinidhi hone ke liye bhi sampatti kii yogyata ko aadhaar banaaya gaya or yah dhani log hi raajnneetik kriyakalapon main bhaag le sakate the or iskaa matlab tha ki dhani log madhyavarg se jude the
 In this way, the French Revolution destroyed the discrimination based on birth, but was replaced by the new feudalism based on wealth instead of ancient feudalism
 kranti ke dauraan krantikariyon ne nirankush sarkaar dwaara liye gaye rinon kii baat to kii kintu un rinon ko maaf karne kii baat kisi ne nahin kii
 The reason was that this loan was given to the government by the bourgeoisie
 isi prakaar sarkaar ne carch kii sampatti ko to jabt kiya parantu use bhoomihinon ko nahin baanta gaya
 The lands were sold at the highest prices and the middle class had the ability to buy this land
 francisi kranti ne mazdooron ke hiton ko najrandaaj kiya or shramik andolan ko hatotsahit kiya
 The working class played an important role during the revolution, but the bourgeois leadership did not approve of its growing position
 atah neshnal asembli ne nirankush rajtantr yug main nirmit kanoonon ko punah lagu kar diya
 Due to which all trade union related works were banned and guilds were declared illegal
 neshnal essembali main burjuaon kii pradhanta thi or usamen jirondist or jacobiyan bhi burjua varg se sambandhit the
 Although the Jacobians spoke of the interests of the proletariat, the establishment of a state of terror kept bourgeois interests above and army's help was taken to suppress the workers' reactions
 diarectory ke shashan main bhi madhyavargeey hiton ko pramukhataa di gai
 All members of the bicameral legislature that the governing board created were middle-class intellectuals
 nepolian ke sudhaaron par bhi burjuai prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 He protected the right to property in his code of law, preserving bourgeois interests, giving relatively broad rights to the nobles and the middle class benefited from its commercial and commercial reforms
 is tarah kranti ke swaroop main madhyavargeey tatv dikhaai dete hai
 But from the analysis of the entire revolution and its impact, it is clear that in the revolution there was co-existence of farmers, laborers, women with middle class elements
 is tareeke se yah maatr madhyavargeey kranti nahin thi apitu ek lokapriy kranti ke rup main ise dekha ja saktaa he
 The French Revolution took on a worldwide character
 krantikariyon ne 1789 main manushya tathaa naagarik adhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii, jiske tahat kaha gaya ki janm se samaan paidaa hone ke kaaran sabhi manushyon ko samaan adhikaar milanaa chahie or yah sabhi deshon ke liye sabhi manushyon ke liye, sabhi samay ke liye or udhaaharan swaroop sari duniya ke liye hai
 This declaration was made not just for France but for the good of all people everywhere who wanted to be independent and to be free from the burden of autocratic monarchy and feudal privileges
 neshnal essembali dwaara 1792 i
 main compene naamak angeraj nayak ko francisi naagarik kii oopaadhi di gai or use neshnal kanvension kaa pratinidh bhi chunaa gaya
 Similarly, during the revolution, the idea was to expand the revolution to other countries of Europe to keep it stable and strong
 isamen ek aise yuddh kii kalpana kii gai jisamen francisi senaayen padosi deshon main pravesh kar vahaan ke sthaneey krantikariyon se milakar rajtantr ko apdasth kar ganatantron kii sthapana karti he
 The French Revolution was not just a national event, but the whole Europe resonated with the principles - slogans of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke prabhaav itane doorgaami rahe ki samast europe isse aachhadit hua
 It was said in this context that "if France has a cold, then all of Europe sneezes
" ” The French Revolution was not as well planned as the Russian Revolution
 vastutah roosi kranti bolshevikon dwaara suniyojit thi or uskaa uddeshy satta hasil kar sarvhaara kaa shashan sthapit karnaa tha lekin francisi kranti shuru se ant tak ghatnaon or paristhitiyon kaa shikaar raheen or ghatnaayen is tarah se nahin ghati jis tarah se krantikariyon ne chaha balki ghatnaon ne krantikariyon ko apana rasta badalane ke liye majaboor kiya
 If the other states had accepted the third state in the meeting of the States General, the trend of revolution would have been second
 isi prakaar aatank kaa rajya or diarectory ke shashan bhi suniyojit dhang se nahin chale
 From this point of view this revolution was chaotic
 francisi kranti ke mul main tatkaaleen francisi samaaj kii duravastha bhi ek mahatvapurn kaarak thi
 The whole society was divided into privileged and unprivileged classes
 krishakon kii sthiti karon ke boj se kharaab thi to duusari taraf unhen saamanton ke atyaachaar tathaa carch ke hastkshep se bhi shoshan kaa shikaar hona padataa tha
 These conditions led the revolution and the revolutionaries raised their voice against this inequality and gave the slogan of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke dauraan hi samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa hui, visheshadhikaron ko khatm kiya gaya
 The general public had participated in the French Revolution, but by ignoring their interests, the revolution took the form of totalitarianism in which the principles and wishes of any one person dominated
 vastutah kranti ke dauraan robspier ke netritv main ek taanaashaahee sarkaar yaa adhinayakatantr kii sthapana hui thi or aage chalakar nepalian ne bhi adhinayakatantr kii sthapana kii
 The French Revolution was a strong reaction against all the distortions, inconsistencies and fundamental faults prevailing in the ancient system
 kranti ne nirankush rajtantr asamanta par aadhaarit francisi samaaj, vilasitapurna padri varg tathaa aarthik diwaaliyepan ke sankat se jujh rahe kushasan kaa ant kar france main prajatantric shashan pranali kaa maarg prashast kiya
 From this point of view, it can be seen as a progressive revolution
 itnaa hi nahin maanavdhikaron kii ghoshnaa swatantraaa, samanta va bandhutav ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ko avgat karaayaa parinamswaroop vishwa ke kai deshon main raajnneetik adhikaron kii maang ko lekar janandolan hone lage
 The spirit of unification of Italy and Germany was encouraged
 dharm or raajnneeti ke pruthakkaran kaa mudda pehali baar is kranti ke dauraan uthaa
 State and politics were separated from religion
 vishwa itihaas main france kii rajya kranti ko vishisht mahatv praapt he yah maanav itihaas kii ek mahatvapurn ghatana maani jaati he
 In this, not only France, but also brought a priceless change in the life of Europe, in this, by destroying the feudal system that had been prevailing in the past, it gave way to modern democratic system
 rajtantr kii nirankushta samaapt hui or loktantric vaataavarna main logon ne chaiyn kii saans lee
 At this time, the question arises in front of us why the revolution in 1789 AD was not in other European countries but in France first
 18 veen shatabdi ke europe rashtron kaa adhyayan karne se gyaat hota he ki us samay france kii jo sthiti thi usase bhi badtar anya europe rashtron kii thi
 The autocratic monarchy was weighed down by the class with ease and the unbearable burden of taxes
 saadhaaran varg praaia: sabhi europe deshon main maujud the
 The condition of some states was more distorted than France, Prasha, Austria and Russia etc
 were also more distorted than France
 francisi krishak anya europe rashtron kii apeksha khushaal the
 The condition of the ordinary class was worse in other European states
 phir bhi kranti in deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi hui
 The main reason for this was that the French people were aware of their situation
 kranti ke liye yah koi aavashyak shart nahin ki iskaa visphot usee deshon main ho jahaan ke log atyaachaar, anachar or shoshan ke shikaar ho
 Revolution can also happen in a rich and advanced country
 basharte uske nivasee yah mahasus kare ki unke saath anyaay ho rahaa he
 The people of France were realizing this injustice
 or se dur karnaa chaahati thi
 Many philosophers and writers were born there who drew the attention of people to these sufferings through their writings, in spite of the worsening situation of other European countries, there was first a revolution against Louis Solven in France
 is kranti ke anek kaaran the jo is prakaar he
 Changed form of French feudalism and improved status of farmers francisi kisaanon kii unnat avasthaa or samantvaad kaa badla hua swarup aisa kaaran tha
 This led to the first state revolution in France
 europea desh ke kisaan abhi udaasi kii sthiti main the
 But the French peasants had become independent
 unke paas apni jameen apana makaan itani suvidha ke baavjud samant kar evam samant sevaaon kaa ant nahin hua tha unhen apni aamadani kaa bahut bada hissaa samant kar ke rup main chukaana padataa tha
 And still his position is good
 ve paise bachaakar kuch na- kuch jameen kharid liya karte the jameen kharidne kii bhukh nirantar badhati ja rahi thi isamen samant kar va berogari baadhak the at: ve samant peshon ko hataane kii baat soch rahe the at: madhyam varg ke netritv main unhe bal mila or 1789 i
 main unhone vidroh kar diya
 Lack of tradition of liberal autocracy in France- anya europea deshon main bhi nirankush rajtantr tha
 But the emperors there had reduced their autocracy over time
 prasha kaa raja fredirak apane samay kaa mahaan prabud prashaasak tha
 Other countries of Europe followed by Russia, Italy, Spain etc
 unhone samaynusaar jaataa kii aarthik bhautik tathaa anya kshetron main unnat karne kaa yatha sambhav prayaas kiya
 But France lacked such liberal autocracy
 vahaan ke raja janata kii bhalaai ke liye kuch nahin kar rahe the
 Rather, it became his policy to collect more taxes and exploit the public
 isliye france kii janata isse ub gai thi isliye france kii janata nirankush rajtantr ko samaapt karnaa chaahati thi
 Awareness of medium france main hi sarvapratham kranti hone kaa kaaran vahaan kaa madhyamvarg tha
 Other countries also had a middle class but they were not as cultural, rich and educated as in France
 unamem shakti kaa abhaav tha
 They could not think of rebelling against the king
 france main madhyam varg ke log anek kaaran se apane samraaton se asantusht the
 And for his own defense, Raj was desperate to curb power
 anya europea rajyon main is tarah kii sthiti kaa abhaav tha
 There was no one to lead in other countries, there was a ready middle class in France
 at: sarvapratham france main hi kranti hui
 Usefulness of noble class kuleen vahg ko pahase visheshadhikaar is liye diya gaya tha ki ve shashan chalaane main raja kii madad kare
 And they also used to protect Janata
 parantu dhire – 2 yah kaary raja ke karmchaaree karne laga
 As a result, the usefulness of the nobility ended
 phir bhi iske visheshadhikaar main kisi prakaar kii katautee nahin kii gai
 Hence the peasants and middle class people started hating the Kulinwarg
 anya deshon main aisi baat nahin thi
 There still remained the father of the nobility
 darshanikon kaa prabhaav- In the 18th century, there was a chaotic movement throughout Europe
 darshanik, vichaarak, vaagyanik sabhi deshon main viddhman the
 But the main among them were the French thinkers
 jinhone kranti kaa manovaigyanik aadhaar prastut kiya
 He drew the attention of the people to the evils in the society and gave a voice to the people
 is tarah kaa prayaas anya deshon main nahin kiya ja rahaa tha
 France was the only field of thinkers like Montague, Voltaire Russo
 austria, prasha or rus main is tarah ke vichaarak nahin the
 In other countries of Europe, there was no class of philosophers who gave their real status and created satisfaction in them
 france main hi kranti hone kaa yah ek pramukh kaaran tha
 Lack of political participation england main jab madhyam varg ne jaagarukta ai to use desh kii raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa avasar diya gaya
 But this was not the case with France
 france kaa madhyam varg apane samraaton se kaaphi asantusht tha
 They were expected
 shikshit hone ke baavjood unhen kulinon kii tarah pratishtha uplabdh nahin thi
 They were not given the opportunity to participate in French politics
 isliye unhone asantusht hokar kranti kaa naaraa buland kiya
 Ineligible king and corruption in administration- france kii rajanithik vyavastha kendrikrut thi lekin raja ayogy the
 The administration was dominated by corruption
 europe ke anya deshon main nirankush shashan totha parantu raja yogya the or shashan par unka purn niyantran tha
 The middle class of France was feeling this administrative corruption
 tathaa isliye vah vidroh karne ke liye taiyaar tha
 Rise of national spirit is samay europe main teji se rashtriya bhaavana kaa udai hone laga
 France was the only country in entire Europe where there was a complete lack of a national spirit
 iske chalate bhi sarvapratham france main hi kranti hui
 Effect of American freedom struggle- 1766 i
 main american swatantraaa sangram prarambh hua
 The American people revolted against England
 france ke sainikon ko bhi is swatantraaa sangram main bhaag lene kaa avasar mila at: unhone yah mahasus kiya ki yuddh ke dwaara swatantraaa prapti kii ja sakati he
 He also realized that freedom is possible only through freedom
 france lautne par unhone dekha kii jis swatantraaa ko liye unhonen america main yuddh kiya usee swatantraaa kaa france main purnat: abhaav he
 Hence, he became restless for the revolution here and tried to get freedom through war
 europe ke anya deshon main aisi baat nahin thi
 Superiority of French Civilization france main hi kranti hone kaa ek vishisht kaaran yah tha ki yahan kii sabhyataa or saanskriti anya europe kii sabhyataa or saanskriti anya europe rashtron kii apeksha adhik samrudh or vaibhav purna thi
 Even in terms of governance, the rule of France was highly organized
 france sampoorn europe sabhyataa or saanskriti kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 Paris is considered the largest center of literature and thought in all of Europe
 france janamat anya europe rajyon kii apeksha adhik jaagrit or aalochanatmak tha
 As a result of all these reasons, in 1789 AD, there was revolution in France and not in other European states
