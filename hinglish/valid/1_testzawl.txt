 It was used by both the Houses of Parliament and the Royal Courts
 kyonki vastav main yah ek shahi grih tha, isliye yahaan par donon sadanon ke kisi anya kaary ke liye koi kaksh nahin banaaya gaya tha
 The main festivals of the state were celebrated in painted rooms

 kyonki sansad ko apane simit jagah me kaary karne main pareshaani ho rahi thi isliye pales of westominster main 18 veen shatabdi ke baad se kai prakaar ke parivartan kiye gayi
 The talk of building an entirely new palace was ignored, instead new buildings were added to it
 a new western main gate was built between 1755 and 1770
 yah darwaja saint margaret street kii ore khulata tha
 It was built in the Padalian style
 ab saamudayik kaksh evam sangrakshan ke liye kaaphi jagah ho gayi thi

 He was devastated to carry out this renovation work
 taaki is jagah ke dakshin sire par ek nayaa shahi galiyara or bhavy pravesh dwaar banaaya ja sake
 The tasks that Son did in the palace included the new facility of the library for both the houses of Parliament and the new law room for the king's law bench and the high court
 son dwaara kii nayi kalatmak shilpkaaree ko lekar kai virodhabhas bhi uthne shuru ho gayi
 Those who supported the Gothic art of the original building became opposed to it
 16 oktober 1834 ko pales main aag lag gai jab lathi bhandar main rakhe aag ke stove ke atyadhik tap jane ke kaaran house of laders ke kaksh ne aag pakad lee
 iske parinaam swaroop sansad ke dono sadan nasht ho gayi or aas paas kii anya imaaraten bhi nahin bachiin
 aag bachaav dal kii sartakta ke kaaran or hawa kii disha ke anukool hone kii vajah se westominster haul batch gaya
 The Jewel Tower, the Under Craft Chapel, the Cloisters and the Chapter House of St
 Stephen's are the other parts of the palace that survived the disaster
 aag lagane ke turant baad hi raja wiliam IV ne apana buckingham pales sansad ko dene kii peshkash kii, jo banakar lagbhag taiyaar ho chukaa tha
 The reason behind this was also that he did not like her as his place of residence
 is imaarat ko sansad ke kaary ke liye upyukt nahin paaya gaya
 Therefore the offer was rejected
 charing cars or james park par bhi vichaar nahin ban paaya
 Historical and political connections to Wesminster proved powerful for the transfer
 jabaki vahaan kai kamiyaan thim
 Now priority was being given that Parliament should get its place as soon as possible
 isliye house of lard tathaa house of kamans ke liye jaldi main chitrakala vaale kaksh or safed kaksh ko taiyaar kiya gaya
 The direction for this was done by the remaining craftsman of the Board of Works, Sir Robert Smirk
 farvari 1835 sadan chalaane ke liye kaksh taiyaar karne kaa kaam jaldi jaldi kiya gaya
 a royal organization appointed to study the new structure of the palace, its proposed style was also debated among the people

 It had signs of revolution and republic in the new format
 jabaki gothic sanrachana main sangrakshan ke mulya ke mulya chhipe the
 In 1835, this commission had announced that the format of this building would be either Gothic or Elizabethan
 This royal commission asked all architects to plan with this view

 Although 1860 employees were engaged for this work, this work could not be completed for a decade
 bairi jisaki apni shilpakala gothic kam or panrparik zyada he
 He built this new palace on the basis of new rules of balance
 He relied on Augustus Pugin for interior decoration and grand construction
 Which included wall decoration, carving work, tile work, furniture etc
 duusare vishwa yuddh ke dauraan jab germany ne landan par bambaari kii thi tab alag alag avasar par chaudaa baar pales of westominster bhi is bambaari kaa shikaar hua tha

 It is said that "in the event of an attack, even if you bow down a little, it will not break"

 a fiery bomb hit the chamber of the House of Commons and set fire to it
 The second bomb rocked the roof of Westminster Hall
 The fire rescue team could not save both and it was decided that at least work should be done to keep Andal Hall safe
 These people were successful in this task
 lekin comons kaksh puri tarah se nasht ho chukaa tha or sadsy lobby bhi nahin bachi thi
 a bomb also fell into the lord's chamber, but went off without a break on the ground
 yaa to koi chota bam upar clock tower se takaraayaa tha yaa phir koi vimaan bhedi chat ke chajje par gira tha
 Due to which the roof was severely damaged
 ghadi kaa sheesha puri tarah se nasht ho chukaa tha
 But its hands and bell were still working and even now this big watch was telling the right time

 He was mainly dissatisfied with the design plan devised by Barry
 unhonen iske liye ye tippanee bhi kii thi ki sabhi gracian, sar, yah paaramparik imaarat par tuder style kaa vivaran he"
 The stonework done on this building was actually Anston

 yadhyapi yah sab kharabiyaan jald se jald 1849 tak thik kar lee gayi thim or iske baad 19 veen shatabdi main kuch nahin kiya gaya tha
 During 1900, one thing was very clear that some work of stone carving would have to be changed now
 
 The project was started in 1930, but due to the Second World War, its work stopped and it was finished in 1950 itself
 1960 tak pradooshan ab phir se prabhavi hone laga

 At the southern end of this palace is a very famous tower known as the Clock Tower, it is also known as Big Ben
 yah 96
3 meter ke victoria tower se thodaa hi chota he lekin bahut hi patala he
 It has a large clock in Westminster
 jise ki edward jon dent ne banaaya tha or iskaa dizin shaukia horologist edmund backet denisan ne taiyaar kiya tha
 In a moment, its bells ring completely, the specialty of this big watch is that its timing is absolutely accurate, which the 19th century watchmakers considered difficult
 or 1859 se jab se yah astitv main ai he is par bharosa kaayam he
 Its time is measured in diameter by four dials 7 meters, which are made of milky colored glass and at night it shines from behind

3 meter chota he
 Five bells hang in the clock on the top of the house
 chaar chaturthaansh ghantiyaan westominster ke ghantanad ko har ghante ke har chauthe bhaag main bajaati rahati hai
 The biggest bell when the bell rings is called the Great Bell of Westminster in official language
 saamanyata ise bigaben bhi kehete hai
 Which is the name given to uncertain origins, this name started to be used for the tower over time
 The first bell, which was given this name, broke during testing and it was then re-molded
 There is a rift in the vine that is in front of us today
 jiske kaaran isaki dhwani bhi kuch alag ho gayi he
 If seen, its weight is 13
8 tonnes, the third largest clock in Britain
 The lantern that is placed at the top of the clock tower is the Ayrton light, it only burns when the assembly of the rough house of Parliament continues even after dark

 inaki yojana ke anusaari hi pales ke madhya main ek badi chimney banaai gai thi
 For which they had said that the polluted and hot air generated by the fire burning from all four sides of the palace will come out through this chimney
 In order to replace the tower, it was emphasized to Barry that he planned the high roof of the lobby
 un chhaton ko nicha hi rakhaa jaye
 or isaki khidakiyon kii oochai ko bhi kam kiya jaye
 halaki yah stambh bhi mahal kii bahari sanrachana ke liye ek acha mauka sabit hua
 Barry had conceived the design of a tower for this so that these large pillars could be balanced
 Eventually, the central tower completely failed in its purpose
 But this work was worth noting because it was the first time mechanical services were directly impacting the craft
 shikhar choote kangure jo khidakiyon ke baade ke bich tathaa mahal ke saamne se uthte hue upar kii ore ja rahe hai, yah aakash ke kshitij se lagati imaarat ko sajiv banaate hai
 Like the central tower, it is also connected for some practical reasons, it also makes way for the movement of light

 Sri Lanka has about 15,000 monks and nuns in 6,000 Buddhist monasteries
 According to traditional Sri Lankan chronicles such as the Dipavamsa, Buddhism was introduced into Sri Lanka in the third century BCE after the Third Buddhist council by Mahinda Bhikkhu, son of Emperor Ashoka, during the reign of Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura
 During this time, a sapling of the Bodhi Tree was brought to Sri Lanka and the first monasteries and Buddhist monuments were established
 Among these, the Isurumuniya and the Vessagiri remain important centers of worship
 He is also credited with the construction of the Pathamaka cetiya, the Jambukola vihāra and the Hatthālhaka vihāra and the refectory
 The Pali Canon, having previously been preserved as an oral tradition, was first committed to writing in Sri Lanka around 30 BCE
 Mahavamsa §29 records that during the rule of the greco-bactrian King Menander I, a Yona head monk named Mahadharmaraksita led 30,000 Buddhist monks from "the Greek city of Alasandra" north of modern Kabul, Afghanistan) to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the Ruwanwelisaya in Anuradhapura, indicating that greco-buddhism contributed to early Sri Lankan Buddhism
 See also the Milinda Panha
 As a result of the work of Buddhaghosa and other compilers such as Dhammapala, Sri Lanka developed a strong tradition of written textual transmission of the Pali Canon
 The compilation of the Atthakatha along with the Nikāyas and other Pitakas were committed to writing for the first time in the Aluvihare Rock Temple during the first century BCE
 Buddhist literature in Sinhalese also thrived and by 410, Sri Lankan monks traveled widely throughout India and Asia introducing their works
 Over much of the early history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, three subdivisions of Theravāda existed in Sri Lanka, consisting of the monks of the three mahaviharas, Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya, Abhayagiri vihāra and Jetavanaramaya
 The Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya was the first tradition to be established while Abhayagiri vihāra and Jetavanaramaya were established by monks who had broken away from the Maha Viharaya tradition
 According to AK Warder, the Indian Mahīśāsaka established itself in Sri Lanka alongside the Theravadas, into which they were later absorbed
 Northern regions of Sri Lanka also seem to have been ceded to sects from India at certain times
 In the 7th century, Xuanzang wrote of two major divisions of Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka, referring to the Abhayagiri tradition as the "mahayana Sthaviras," and the Mahāvihāra tradition as the "hinayana Sthaviras
" Abhayagiri appears to have been a center for Mahayana and Vajrayana teachings; Xuanzang writes, "the Mahāvihāravāsins reject the Mahāyāna and practice the Hīnayāna, while the Abhayagirivihāravāsins study both Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna teachings and propagate the Tripiṭaka
 In the 8th century, both Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism were being practiced in Sri Lanka, and two Indian monks responsible for propagating Vajrayana Buddhism in China, Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra, visited the island during this time
 In Pali commentaries, terms used for the Mahayanins of Abhayagiri were Vaitulya, Vaipulya and Vaidalya
 According to HR Perera, the Theravada commentaries considered them heretical and their doctrines included: In the 5th century, Faxian visited Sri Lanka and lived there for two years with the monks
 Faxian obtained a Sanskrit copy of the Vinaya of the Mahīśāsaka at the Abhayagiri vihāra c
 406
 The Mahīśāsaka Vinaya was then translated into Chinese in 434 by Buddhajiva and Zhu Daosheng
 This translation of the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya remains extant in the Chinese Buddhist canon as Taishō Tripiṭaka 1421
 The 7th century pilgrim Xuanzang first learned for several years at Nalanda and then intended to go to Sri Lanka to seek out further instruction
 However, after meeting Sri Lankan monks in the Chola capital who were refugees, he decided not to visit: From the 5th century to the eleventh century, the island of Sri Lanka saw continuous warfare between local kings, pretenders and foreign invaders such as the South Indian Chola and Pandyan dynasties
 This warfare saw the sacking of viharas and made the situation for difficult for Buddhism
 In 1070, Vijayabahu i of Polonnaruwa conquered the island and set about repairing the monasteries
 The state of Sri Lankan Buddhism was so bad at this time that he could not find five bhikkhus in the whole island to ordain more monks and restore the monastic tradition; Therefore, he sent an embassy to Burma, which sent back several eminent elders with Buddhist texts
 The king oversaw the ordination of thousands of monks
 The royal reforming of Sri Lankan Buddhism continued under Parakramabahu I, who restored many stupas and monasteries
 During this period, Sri Lankan Buddhist literature thrived once again and the three greats writers Mahākassapa Thera of Dimbulagala Raja Maha Vihara, Moggallana Thera and Sāriputta Thera compiled Pali commentaries and sub-commentaries
 Parakramabahu II of Dambadeniya was a learned king and wrote several Sinhalese Buddhist texts
 Before the 12th century, more rulers of Sri Lanka gave support and patronage to the Abhayagiris, and travelers such as Faxian saw the Abhayagiris as the main Buddhist tradition in Sri Lanka
 The trend of Abhayagiri being the dominant sect changed in the 12th century, when the Maha Viharaya gained the political support of Parakramabahu I, who completely abolished the Abhayagiri and Jetavanaya traditions
 The monks of these two traditions were then defrocked and given the choice of either returning to the laity permanently or attempting reordination under the Maha Viharaya tradition as sāmaṇeras
 Parakkamabāhu also appointed a saṅgharāja "king of the Sangha," a monk who would preside over the Sangha and its ordinations in Sri Lanka with the assistance of two deputies
 Veneration of Avalokiteśvara has continued to the present day in Sri Lanka, where he is called Nātha
 In more recent times, some western-educated Theravādins have attempted to identify Nātha with Maitreya
 However, traditions and basic iconography, including an image of Amitābha on his crown, identify Nātha as Avalokiteśvara
 Early reports by Europeans from the 18th century describe the Buddhist monks of Sri Lanka as being engaged in the recitation of mantras and using Buddhist prayer beads for counting as practiced in Mahayana Buddhism
 Sri Lanka has the longest continuous history of Buddhism of any Buddhist nation, with the Sangha having existed in a largely unbroken lineage since its introduction in the 3rd century BCE
 During periods of decline, the Sri Lankan monastic lineage was revived through contact with Burma and Thailand
 From the 16th century onward, missionaries and Portuguese, Dutch and British colonizers of Sri Lanka have attempted to convert the local population to Christianity
 The wars with the Portuguese and their allies weakened the Sangha
 In 1592, Vimaladharmasuriya i of Kandy sought aid from Burma in order to ordain Buddhist monks on the island as there was hardly a single properly ordained monk left
 From 1612 to 1658, the Dutch and the Portuguese fought over the island with the Sinhalese caught in the middle, the Dutch won and occupied the maritime sections of the island that had been occupied by the Portuguese until 1796 when they surrendered their territories to the British
 The Dutch were less zealous than the Portuguese in their religious proselytizing, though they still discriminated against Buddhists which were not allowed to register with the local authorities therefore many Sinhalese pretended to be Protestant
 During this period many religiously inclined Sinhalese rulers of the interior such as Vira Narendra Sinha of Kandy and Sri Vijaya Rajasinha of Kandy continued to patronize Buddhism, restoring temples and monasteries
 In the mid 18th century the higher ordination of Buddhist monks known as upasampada, which was defunct at the time, was revived with the help of Thai Buddhist monks on the initiatives taken by Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero during the reign of king Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe
 In 1813 the American Ceylon Mission was established in Jaffna
 In 1815 a British army captured Kandy and deposed the Sinhalese king ending a line of Buddhist kings lasting 2301 years, they retained Sri Lanka until 1948
 Like the Dutch, the British refused to register unbaptized infants and to accept non-christian marriages
 They also always preferred Christians in government administration
 The British also supported various Christian missionary groups who established schools on the island
 Education in these schools were a requirement for government office
 Missionaries also wrote tracts in Sinhalese attacking Buddhism and promoting Christianity In the 19th century, a national Buddhist movement began as a response to Christian proselytizing, and was empowered by the results of the Panadura debate between Christian priests and Buddhist monks such as Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera and Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera which was widely seen as a victory for the Buddhists
 In 1880 Henry Steel Olcott arrived in Sri Lanka with Madame Blavatsky of the Theosophical Society; he had been inspired when he read about the Panadura debate and after learning about Buddhism converted to the religion
 Olcott and the Sinhalese Buddhist leaders established the Buddhist Theosophical Society in 1880, with the goal of convicted Buddhist schools
 The society also had its own publications to promote Buddhism; the Sinhalese newspaper, Sarasavisandarasa, and its English counterpart, The Buddhist
 As a result of their efforts, Vesak became a public holiday, Buddhist registrars of marriage were allowed, and interest in Buddhism increased
 Another important figure in the revival is Anagarika Dharmapala, initially an interpreter for Olcott, who traveled around the island preaching and writing
 After traveling to India, he established the Maha Bodhi Society in 1891 whose goal was to revive Buddhism in India, and restore the ancient Buddhist shrines at Bodh Gaya, Sarnath and Kushinara
 His efforts saw the restoration of these sites and a renewal of interest in Buddhism among some Indians
 The associations of the Buddhist revival also contributed much to the publication of Buddhist texts, and promotion of Buddhist scholarship
 Revivalist Buddhist scholars include Sir DB Jayatillake, FR Somnayake, Valisinha Harishchandra and WA de Silva
 Several Buddhist shrines were also rebuilt
 Buddhist leaders were also active in the movement for Sri Lankan independence
 Since independence, Buddhism has continued to thrive on the island
 Since the Buddhist revival Sri Lanka has also been an important center of Western Buddhist scholarship
 One of the first western bhikkhus, Nyanatiloka Mahathera studied in Sri Lanka, established the Island Hermitage there and ordained several western monks
 Western monks who studied in the island hermitage such as Nanamoli Bhikkhu and Ven
 Nyanaponika were responsible for many important translations of the Pali Canon and other texts on Buddhism in English and German
 a few years after the arrival of Mahinda, Bhikkhuni Sanghamitta, who is also believed to be the daughter of Emperor Ashoka, came to Sri Lanka
 She started the first nun's order in Sri Lanka, but this order of nuns died out in Sri Lanka in the 11th century
 Many women have been ordained in Sri Lanka since 1996
 In 1996 through the efforts of Sakyadhita, an International Buddhist Women Association, Theravada bhikkhuni order was revived, when 11 Sri Lankan women received full ordination in Sarnath, India, in a procedure held by Ven
 Dodangoda Revata Mahāthera and the late Ven
 Mapalagama Vipulasāra Mahāthera of the Mahābodhi Society in India with assistance from monks and nuns of Korean Chogyo order
 Some bhikkhuni ordinations were carried out with the assistance of nuns from the East Asian tradition; others were carried out by the Theravada monk's Order alone
 Since 2005, many ordination ceremonies for women have been organized by the head of the Dambulla chapter of the Siyam Nikaya in Sri Lanka
 The different sects of the Sri Lankan Buddhist clergy are referred to as Nikayas, and three main Nikayas are: Within these three main divisions there are numerous other divisions, some of which are caste based
 There are no doctrinal differences among any of them
 Buddhism in Sri Lanka is predominantly practiced by the Sinhalese, however the 2012 Sri Lanka Census revealed a Buddhist population of 22,254, including eleven monks, amongst the Sri Lankan Tamil population, accounting to roughly 1% of all Sri Lankan Tamils in Sri Lanka
 In 1988 almost 93% of the Sinhalese speaking population in Sri Lanka were Buddhist

 Freud considered it to be the most important part of the personality

 Freud also faced accusations that he was over-imagining psychology and mixing mythological texts, giving sexual needs more space than necessary
 frid ke kaary or un par aadhaarit unki manyataon ke dekhne par ham yah pate hai ki frid ne maanav kii pashavik pravriti par zarurat se adhik bal daalaa tha
 He made it clear that many of the qualities and characteristics of inferior animals are also seen in humans

 Freud was of the opinion that no change can be brought about in the nature of an adult person because the foundation of his personality is found in childhood, which cannot be changed in any way
 However, later research has proved that humans are fundamentally future oriented

 The cult of psychoanalysis propounded by Freud was very popular due to its popularity
 Freud wrote several books, among which "inter pretation of Dreams", "group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego", "totem and Taboo" and "civilizations and Its Discontents" are prominent

 There is a practice of bride price and bulls and clothes are given for this

 But due to government prohibition this practice has become very less
 samast gaanv kii bhoomi samudaay kii sapatti hoti he or kheti ke liye vyaktigat pariwaron ko aavashyaktaanusaar di jaati he
 Due to ban on dahiya cultivation and population pressure, many groups had to come to the outer areas and plains

 From this point of view, there are four major sub-castes of Gonds: one is those who have become ordinary farmers and landowners, such as: Rajagond, Raghuval, Dadway and Katulya Gond duusare ve hai jo mili jule gaanvon main khet mazdooron, bhaad jhonkne, pashu charaane or palki dhone jaise sevak jatiyon ke kaam karte hai

 gondon kii kul aabaadi 30 se 40 lakh ke bich aanki jaati he, yadhyapi san 1941 kii janaganana ke anusaar yah sankhya 25 lakh he
 The reason for this is that many Gond castes count themselves among Hindu castes
 bengal, bihar or uttar pradesh ke dakshini bhaagon main bhi kuch gond jatiyaan hai jo hindu samaaj kaa ang ban gai hai
 The people of the Gond tribe are divided into 12 castes
 kintu unki 50 se adhik upjatiyaan hai jinamein oonch neech kaa bhedbhaav bhi he
 In fact it is difficult to call the Gonds a tribe in pure form
 inke vibhinn samooh sabhyataa ke vibhinn staron par hai or dharm, bhashaa tathaa veshbhusha sambandhi ekta bhi unamem nahin he; na koi aisa janajatiy sanghathan he jo sab gondon ko ekta ke sutara main bandhta ho
 For example, Rajgond Samaj are Kshatriyas
 anya anek samooh gondi bhashaa tathaa puraane janajaatiy dharm ko chhod chuke hai
 Their history is very glorious
 rajgado ne hindu dharm apana liya he ar kuch ne islam ko chunaa he

45 Bara Khudabandpur is a village in Begusarai, Bihar
 shukraniti ek prasiddh nitigranth he
 The name of Venus who composed it is found in the Mahabharata as 'shukracharya'
 shukraniti ke rachanaakaar or unke kaal ke bare main kuch bhi pataa nahin he
 Shukraniti has 2000 verses mentioned in its fourth chapter
 usamen yah bhi likhaa he ki is nitisar kaa raat-din chintan karne vaala raja apana rajya-bhaar uthaa sakane main sarvatha samarth hota he
 It states that there is no other policy like Shukraniti in all the three worlds and for business people, Venus has a policy, the rest is 'kuniti'
 shukraniti kii saamagree kaamandakeey nitisar se bhinn milti he
 Out of its four chapters, the first chapter deals with matters related to the king, his importance and duties, social system, minister and crown prince
 pracheen bhartiya ranithik chintan main shukraniti kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 Shukracharya's creator Shukracharya holds a respected place in ancient Indian thought
 dandi ke ‘dashakumarcharitam‘ main raajnneeti shaastrakaron ke namollekh main sarvapratham sthaan shukracharya ko hi pradaan kiya he
 Despite being such an ancient text, it has details of many such topics which are relevant and useful even today
 shukraniti chintan kii gauravshaalee evam samrudh parampara kaa gyaan hota he
 Like Kautilya's 'arthashastra' and Machiavelli's 'the Prince', the king has also been taught to rule in Venus's Venus
 is prakaar isamen raajnneeti kaa saiddhanthik nahin varan vyaavhaarik paksh adhik mahatvapurn he
 According to Venus, "the king should abandon all apprehensions and follow a policy that kills the enemy, that is, victory"
 shukracharya ke anusaar, unhone apane shishyon ke saamne brahma ke nitishastra kaa saar prastut kiya he
 There are four basic chapters in the Shukra Policy
 iske vibhinn sanskarnon main pancham adhyay ’khil niti‘ ke rup main he jo mul granth kaa bhaag nahin he
 Determining the period of Shukracharya is a very difficult task
 apni vishaywastu va style ke aadhaar par yah kautilya ke arthshaastra ke baad kii rachana prathit hoti he
 It seems that the name Venus actually expresses a particular tradition of thinking, not a person
 bhartiya raajnneetik chintan ke strot ke rup main ise ek pramanik granth mana jaataa he
 Although there is a difference of opinion among scholars regarding the creation of Shukranitisar, almost all modern scholars agree that it is not a Vedic work but a post-christian work
 kashiprasad jaiswal ke anusaar, yah 8veen shatabdi kii rachana he
 Its author can be called the philosopher of this period
 shukraniti, kautilya ke arthshaastra ke samaan multah raajnneetik prakruti kaa granth he isamen shukr ne kautilya evam kaamandak ke samaan gyaan kii chaar shakhaayen - anvikshiki, trayee, vaarta evam dandniti ko sweekaar kiya he
 According to BK Sarkar, the commentator of Shukraniti, "penalty is a discipline related to governance and instruction
" ’’ yah kahana uchit he ki shukr ne vibhinn prasango main dand va niti kaa jo mahatv bataaya he vah dandniti arthath raajnneetishastra kaa hi mahatv hai
 Apart from the policy or ethics of punishments, all the scriptures are related to a limited part of the whole human behavior, but ethics is the scripture related to the whole human behavior
 is shaastra kii sahaayta se hi raja apane aadharbhoot dayitvon kii purti main safal hota he, kintu jo raja niti kaa tyaag karke achche vyavhaar karata he, vah dukh bhogata he or uske sevak bhi ksht pate he
 Shyamlal Pandey, stating the importance of Shukraniti essence, has said that it is the only available book based on the punishing ideology of ancient India
 shukracharya ke anusaar dharm, arth, kaam kaa pradhan kaaran evam moksh ko sunishchit karne vaala tatv nitishastra ko hi mana ja saktaa he
 Shukraniti portrays all the important aspects of political thought - philosophical, conceptual, structural, procedural, with substantial significance
 rajya ke prayojan, rajasatta par niyantran aadi saiddhanthik pakshon ke saath-saath dand va nyaayik prakriya, rajya kaa prashasan, rajya kii suraksha va yuddh, antararajya sambandh aadi aise vishyon kaa jo rajya ke vyaavhaarik pakshon se sambandhit hai, vishad vivechan kiya gaya he
 The theory of the origin of the state is not detailed in Shukraniti
 sampoorn granth main maatr ek shloke aisa he jise rajya kii utpatti se sambandhit mana ja saktaa he
 In the first chapter of Shukraniti, it is said, "by accepting his annual tax as a salary from the praja, the king situated as a lord has been appointed by Brahma as a servant for the praja"
 is prakaar jahaan rajya kii utpatti brahma dwaara bataakar, rajya kii utpatti ke daivi siddhanth kaa samarthan kiya he, raja ko praja-sevak bataakar uske praja-paalan ke daayitv par bal diya or uske kisi bhi prakaar ke daivi adhikaar ko sweekaar nahin kiya he
 Venus has accepted the state as an indispensable and natural institution because it is the base state of the rise of this world
 jis prakaar chandramaa samudr kii vruddhi kaa kaaran he, usee prakaar rajya janata ke abhyuday kaa mul aadhaar he
 It is the state that provides justice, religion and work for justice
 jaise mallaah ke abhaav main nauka nasht ho jaati he, usee prakaar raja ke netritv ke abhaav main praja jan ke nasht hone kii sambhaavna rahati he
 Venus has held the state responsible not only for the physical safety of the subjects, but also for the moral uplift
 pracheen bhartiya chintan main rajya ko saptang rajya ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he, shukr bhi iskaa apwaad nahin hai
 The state is made up of seven limbs, it is made up of Swami, Amatya, Mitra, Kosh, Rashtra, Durg, Sena
 shukraniti main kaha gaya he, ‘‘rajya ke in saat nirmaanak tatwon main swami sir, amaatya netra, mitra karn, kosh mukh, sena man, durg bhujaaain evam raashtra pair hai
 "in another context, comparing the state to the tree, the root of this tree to the king, the wing to the ministers, the branch to the commander, the Pallavas to the army, the dust to the subjects, the fruits to the factors derived from the land and the seeds to the land of the state
" Has been said yah ullekhneey he ki jahaan aadhunik raajnneetik vichaarak rajya ke 4 nirmaanak tatv - jansankhya, bhu-bhaag, sarkaar evam samprabhutaa maanate he vahiin shukr 7 nirmaanak tatv maanate hai
 Explaining the difference between the state and the nation in Shukraniti, it has been said that sovereign control over a specific nation gives it the form of a state
 is prakaar shukraniti rajya va raashtra ke madhya antar ko aadhunik raajnneetik vichaarkon kii tarah spasht karti he
 In Shukraniti, the work area of the state is described as very broad
 shukr ne rajya ke karttavyon ke 8 pramukh kshetron kaa ullekh kiya he- It is clear from this list of state obligations that Venus has rendered a wide scope of the state
 saath hi yah bhi spasht kar diya he ki rajya ko apane dayitvon ko puraa karne ke liye aavashyak saadhan bhi arjeet karne chahie
 Venus has included the following major functions in the domain of the state: - shukr ke anusaar, sena evam raashtra kii raksha evam samruddhi ke liye kosh kaa aadharbhoot mahatv he
 But the king should not collect the funds unjustly
 yadi raja sankatkaal kaa muqabla karne ke liye praja se adhik dhan vasuul kare to sankatkaal kii samaapti par praja ko byaaj sahit dhan vaapis karnaa chahie
 Venus has given central importance to the Rajapada, the main duty of the king is praja-ranjan
 raja ke bina praja aise hi nasht ho jaati he, jaise mallaah rahit nauka nasht ho jaati he
 Venus, as mentioned, describes the king as composed of the portions of the eight deities
 shukr aise bhartiya vichaarak hai, jinhone raja ke pratyaksh dev hone kii dharna kaa virodh kiya he
 Venus has neither accepted the king as a 'dev' nor considered her divine authority, but must have explained the divinity of her obligations
 dayitvon kii divyata ke kaaran swayan shaasha bhi apni ichha se in dayitvon se mukt nahin ho saktaa
 Adhering to Rajdharma also makes the petty king superior, while behaving in contrast, the best king also becomes petty
 shukr ne naitik aadhaar ko bhi vargeekaran main pramukhataa dete huai kaha he ki raja kii aay praja ko pidaa die bina honi chahie tathaa yah keval rajtantr se sambandhit vargeekaran hi he
 Venus has propounded that the successor of the rule should be taken from the Rajkula itself, but the king's eldest son should not automatically be considered the successor of the rule
 raja ke jivit rahete hue hi uttaradhikaar ke prashn ko nishchit karnaa acha he
 Instead of many people, one person should decide the successor
 shukr ne uttaradhikaar ke prashn ko hal karne ke liai rajya kaa vibhaajan karne ke vichaar kaa dridhtaa se nishedh kiya he kyoki rajya vibhajit hone se shatru dwaara nasht karne kii ashanka rahati he
 There can also be such differences in the claimants of succession which can cause destruction for the state and the state
 atah in sabhi ke rajasi maan-sammaan ke jivan kaa prabandh kiya jaae, taaki ye santusht rah saken
 In Shukraniti, the ruler has been given wide powers, but the ruler is expected to use them according to law and religion
 shukr ne raajaaon ko nirankush evam swechhachari banane se rokane ke liai teen upaay sujhaaye he - Venus has expected the ruler to take control of traditions, prestigious social values, etc
 shukraniti saar dwaara sujhaaye gaye naitik upayon main raja kii shiksha, niti va darshan ke upadesh, raja ke sahaayakon evam paramarshdaataaon dwaara prastut drushtaant parloukik sukhon evam dukhon kii vyavastha, raja ke vibhinn karttavya, raja kii dincharya aadi ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Proper consultation of the nature of governance in the administrative area has been considered necessary to save the king from being misguided
 shukr ne rajya ke sucharu sanchaalan ke liye mantriyon aadi ke paraamarsh ke prati shaasha kii nishtha kii aavashyaktaa ko pratipaadit kiya he, saath hi paraamarsh dene ke liye niyukt padaadhikariyon se yah apeksha kii he ki ve raja ko sadaiv uchit paraamarsh den
 Even in an emergency, the king is not considered independent
 vah sambandhit pakshon kii sahmati se hi kathor nirnay lene main samarth hota he
 The behavior of apathy in the judicial field has been termed as a gross moral offense by the ruler, and has warned that if he does, he will go to hell
 nyaayik mukademon ke nirnyon ke liye ek nishchit evam nishpksh prakriya kaa ullekh kiya he, jiskaa raja dwaara paalan kiya janaa he
 Venus has given a detailed description of the qualifications and means of justice of the members of the Nyaya Sabha
 uparokt vivaran se yah spasht he ki shukr ne adharmsheel, swechhachari tathaa raashtra kaa vinaash karne vaale raja ke virodh ko uchit mana he or uske niyantran ke liye vibhinn naitik upayon va vaidhanik upayon ke saath hi vidhanetar upayon par bhi vichaar kiya he
 Even in the discipline festival of Mahabharata, considering the evil king as a true Kali Yuga, his slaughter is considered appropriate
 yah ullekhneey he ki shukr ne dusht va swechhachari raja ke niyantran athwa uski pad-mukti kii vyavastha sweekaari he or uske vadh kaa samarthan nahin kiya he
 According to Shukraniti essence, it is impossible for a highly skilled king in all disciplines to do even the most extreme work like Rajkarya alone
 atah raja ko apane sahaayakon se paraamarsh karnaa chahie
 According to Venus, the king who does not listen to the things of interest and harm that is said by the minister's mouth, is actually a king who is robbing the wealth of the subjects like a robber
 shukr ne mantri parishad ke sadasyon ke liye ‘prakruti‘ shabd kaa prayog kiya he
 According to Altekar, "venus is of the opinion that caste should be questioned only on occasions of food and marriage, not at the time of appointment in the Council of Ministers
 shukr ko shudra ke adheen sainya vibhaag rakhane main koi aapatti nahin he, yadi vah yogya evam rajbhakt ho
 In fact, the Venusian vote is in keeping with the liberal tradition of ancient India
 shaantiparv ne mantriparishad main pratham teen varnon ke alaava teen yogya shudron kii niyukti kaa spasht ullekh kiya he
 The representative should be so qualified that he can identify the doable and unworkable tasks in terms of country, time and place

 According to the government, the following facts about the working of the Council of Ministers have been clarified in this book - mantriparishad kaa sadsy evam sahaayak milakar apane vibhaag se sambandhit kisi vishay par ek lekh taiyaar karte he
 The Raja's commentary on this article first ends its flaws

 This article is signed by all ministers with their own currency
 ant main punah raja avlokan karata he or apana antim nirnay detaa he
 Thus, this process is beneficial for the state because the king also knows the opinion of everyone in writing and reserves the right to final decision
 shukr ne do prakaar ke prashasan kaa ullekh kiya he- kendriya prashasan evam sthaneey prashasan
 Stating the importance of royalty in the central administration, Venus has advised the king to appoint many knowledgeable and virtuous assistants for the advancement of the kingdom
 shukr ne saat prakaar ke sevakon kaa ullekh kiya he or sabhi virgon ke adhikariyon, sahaayakon evam sevakon kii niyukti sambandhi yogyata par vistaar se prakaash daalaa he
 Venus has also mentioned the organization of local administration, which mentions the following 6 officers - kushal prashasan hetu anivaary he ki raja adhikariyon ke kaaryon par kadi najar rakhe
 It has been said in the Shukraniti that if a hundred people give an application against an officer, then that officer should be removed
 shukr ne paraamarsh diya he ki raja anyaay karne vaale adhikariyon se unki shaktiyaan chin le
 It is also necessary for control that one person should not stay in one post for long
 kisi vyakti kii pad par niyukti keval yogyata ke aadhaar par kerani chahie
 Shukraniti mentions 20 departments of administration - yards, horse, gold, silver departments etc
 in vibhaagon ke adhyaksh pad ko saamaanya rup se karm sachiv kaha he, kintu iske saath hi adhyaksh pad ke liai adhyaksh, pati yaa adhipati kii sangya kaa prayog kiya he
 The administrative organization propounded in sukraniti is multi-layered
 prashasan ke kendriya str par sangathit vibhaagon ke atirikt, shukr ne sthaneey, gramin or nagareey prashasan kii sanghathanaatmak sanrachana par prakaash daalaa he
 Venus is of the opinion that Bhaghar, the president of the village of Sahsadh, should be appointed in every village and every city
 prashasan ke samast staron par niyukt carmikon kii vyavsaayik va takneekee yogyataon kaa shukr niti main vistaar se ullekh kiya gaya he
 Venus has given utmost importance to the written order in the office system of administration
 unke anusaar, adhikari yaa sahaayakon ko bina likhit rajagna ke koi kaary nahin karnaa chahie, kyonki raja kii rajmudra va hastakshar yukt likhit aadesh hi vaastavik raja hota he, vyakti raja nahin hota he
 Venus has accepted the system of preserving the written order of the king as a memento
 iske saath hi unhone prashasan main dainik, masik, vaarshik tathaa bahuvarshiya report taiyaar karne par bhi bal diya gaya he
 Venus has emphasized on daily receipt of information for efficient administration of administration
 unka mat he ki raja ko pratidin 100 kos dur tak ke pradeshon kii suchnaaain praapt honi chahie
 Venus has accepted the system of guards and guards for the security of state offices
 carmik vyavastha ke vivechan kii drushti se shukraniti ko vilakshan granth mana ja saktaa he, kyoki carmik vyavastha ke vibhinn pakshon kaa jaisaa sateek, vyavasthit va purna chithran isamen uplabdh he, vah kahin nahin miltaa he
 Code of Conduct for State Employees: All employees are expected to follow the general rules of conduct
 in niyamon yaa aachaar samhita kaa paalan karne vaale karmchaariyon ko granth main shreshth carmik bataaya gaya he
 According to Venus, the devotee should work fully devoted to the master and to his service work
 use shishtaapurvak raja ko sadkaarya kii prerana deni chahie tathaa kabhi bhi maatr chatukaarita nahin kerani chahie
 Employees should never make false promises to the subjects
 anuchit kaaryon jaise- rishwat, jua, krodh, dushcharitrataa aadi ko tyaag dena chahie
 Venus is considered inferior to those who act contrary to the above qualities
 vetan, vetanman va vetanvruddhi : vetan bhugtan ke siddhanth main kaary va kaal donon ko hi aadhaar banaaya gaya he arthath ek nishchit kaal main kiye gayi kaary kii maatra dekhakar hi bhritti di jaati he
 Venus has advised the king not to cut salary and always pay at the appointed time
 shukraniti main spasht pratipaadit kiya gaya he ki carmik kaa nunatam vetan itnaa hona chahie ki us par ashrith vyaktiyon kaa saralata se bharan-poshan ho sak
 The pay scales are divided into superior, medium, even and inferior
 shukr ne raja ko chetavanee di he ki atyant kam vetan praapt karne vaale karmchaaree shashan se asantusht ho jate he or rajkeey kaaryo kii apeksha anya kaaryon main ruchi lene lagate he
 Therefore, as the merit of the worship increases, so too should his salary increase, because it ultimately interests the king himself
 seva avadhi, padonnati evam pad avnati : saamaanya sthiti main ek karmchaaree kii seva avadhi- 40 varsh sweekaar kii he, kintu iske saath hi bhrityon kii sadaiv pariksha hoti rahani chahie or avagun utpann ho jane par bhrity ko pad mukt kar dena chahie
 Shukraniti makes a clear provision for the timely promotion of employees, when a person becomes superior to his position on the basis of his experience, he should be appointed to a higher post
 iske vipareet yadi koi pradhan sevak aalasy aadi ke kaaran apane dayitvon kii upeksha karata he to use apradhan sevak bana dena chahie
 Venus has also arranged for the training of freshers
 pension, kshatipurti, bhavishya nidhi va bonus kii vyavastha : rajaseva main 40 varsh puure karne ke uparaant, sevanivritti ke baad pension rup main paisa aaajeevan diya janaa chahie
 There is not only pension but also family pension
 raaj karmchaariyon ke liye bhavishya nidhi kii yojana ko bhi sweekaar kiya hai
 The king should deduct 1 / 6 or 1 / 4 of the total amount of the salary of the personnel and deposit it with him, and after two or three years, half or full part of that deposit should be paid to the personnel
 vishram evam avkaash ke niyam : niyamit carmikon ke pratidin 12 ghante rajkaarya kii vyavastha he
 The need for providing leave to employees at appropriate intervals and in specific circumstances has been expressed and detailed rules have been formulated
 utsav aadi ke din koi kaary karmchaariyon se nahin karaayaa jaayegaa
 If any more urgent work is done, arrangements have been made to do it on the festive day as well, but there is a clear prohibition of any kind of work on the day of Shraddha
 carmikon ko pratidin nishchit interval par avkaash dene kii vyavastha bhi kii gai he
 After the employees become unwell, arrangements have been made for 'paid' and semi-paid leave
 prativarsh 15 din ke savetan avkaash ke saath swasthya avkaash kii bhi vyavastha kii he
 But when a deserving worshiper becomes ill, he must always be given half his salary, ignoring the duration of his illness
 is prakaar shukraniti pracheen bhartiya raajnneetik chintan kaa aisa granth he
 In which such a detailed and comprehensive description of the personnel system is given, and which is based on the interests of the employees
 shukr ne saamaajik jivan main shaashvat naitik mulyon ke sthaan par desh, kaal, sthiti ke anusaar hi naitik mulyon ko sweekaara he
 Venus has accepted varna and ashram system as the main basis of social organization according to ancient Indian tradition
 kintu ve manu ke samaan kathor evam ati anudaaravaadi nahin hai
 Venus has generally accepted the Varna system based on birth
 kintu iske saath hi karm ke aadhaar par varna vyavastha kaa bhi samarthan kiya he
 Venus has mentioned the traditional works of Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra - the four varnas
 or iske saath hi bataaya he ki brahman varna ke vyakti ko brahmacharya, grihasth, vanprastha evam sanyas naamak chaaron ashramon kaa paalan karnaa chahie
 But following the first three ashrams by the other three remaining varnas is sufficient
 shukr ke anusaar, vyavsaayon ke aadhaar par hi jatiyon kaa nirmaan hota he, isiilie anek jatiyon kaa nirmaan sambhav hua
 It is noteworthy that Venus has not presented the importance of varna and caste in public life like Manu etc
 theologians
 unka mat he ki varna evam jati kaa vishesh mahatv vivaah evam bhojan jaise vyavhaaron main hi he
 In the administration of the nation, Venus has considered the actions, modesty and virtue of a person more important than the varna and caste and has instructed the king to base the actions, modesty and virtues of the person in the appointment of state officials and freshers
 
 shukr ne brahmanon kii atyadhik shreshthata yaa shudra kii hinata kaa pratipaadan nahin kiya he
 From this point of view, the social system of Venus is more liberal, realistic and practical than Manu
 pracheen bhartiya parampara kaa anukaran karte hue shukr ne raja ke kar lagane ke adhikaar par do niyantran lagaae he| The king is such a praja sevak appointed by Brahma, who receives his salary as tax from the praja, so the king has the right to levy tax for the fulfillment of duty of obeying the praja
 raja ko kar nirdhaaran ke liy smriti ke niyamon kaa paalan karnaa chahie, manamaane kar nirdhaaran yaa vasuulne kaa adhikaar raja ko nahin he
 The nature of the tax as the source of the state should be such that the fruit is plucked from the tree, but the tree, leaves, twigs are not damaged
 The king should re-plant the seeds using the fruit as a gardener
 shukraniti saar main do prakaar kii kar pranali dikhaai detii he - Local tax system rashtriya kar pranali
 Shukracharya has accepted the principle of local taxation to meet local needs such as the maintenance of the city police should be maintained from the salary received from the householders
 sthaneey ke atirikt anya sabhi kar isamen shaamil he
 In this, tax policy has been accepted in the context of two periods
 saamanyakalin kar niti sankatkalin kar niti General Policy: - In the normal period, Venus has directed to impose tax keeping in view the economic potential of the people
 unka mat he ki shulk ko itani maatra main liya janaa chahie ki kar daata kii mul puunji kaa ant na ho
 The king should imitate the tendency of the gardener in the collection of the part
 kar is prakaar liya jaae ki raja evam praja donon ke hit main ho, anyaaypurvak evam adharm yukt kar nahin liya janaa chahie, aisa karne par raja nasht ho jaataa he
 The king who wants to increase his treasury, must fulfill the obligation to follow the subjects
 sankat kaaleen karaniti :- aise kaal main raja ko kar kii maatra main vruddhi karne tathaa saamanytah karmukt mado par bhi kar lagane kaa adhikaar hota he
 That is why Venus has considered the shrine and devasthan free during the normal period, but not in the time of crisis
 shukr ne kararopan ke samaan kar-mukti kii vyavastha ko bhi praja ke aarthik vikaas kii drushti se sweekaar kiya he
 Cereals and garments to be purchased for domestic consumption, milk animals for family rearing, animal tax exemption, trade loss merchants, pilgrimage baths and places of devotion for setting up new industries or new agricultural work till double the profit Go to this policy, get knowledge of Venus's public welfare policy
 yah kheti kii upaj par lagaaya jane vaala kar he
 There are 3 major grounds mentioned for the recovery of the part - shukr ke anusaar, kisi dhani kii madad se, grampal naamak bhrity kii madad se yaa matrhaar naamak adhikari kii madad se bhaag vasuul kar saktaa he
 Venus, according to the Indian tradition, refers to tax in the form of grain or cash
 jab kisaan bhaag jamaa karaae to use rajkeey mudrayukta bhaagptr diya janaa chahie
 Fee: According to Venus, the king should receive a fee from the buyer or seller, who is in a position of profit in the economic transaction, should not be fraudulent in the recovery of the fee
 aakar-kar : pracheen bharat main khanij utpaadan par lagaae jane vaale kar ko aakar kar kaha jaataa tha or ise vastu ke rup main vasula jaataa tha
 According to Venus, the king used to receive this tax at different rates on the metals produced from the mine - gold, silver, copper etc
, after deducting the expenditure on production
 jitani mahangi dhaatu, utana hi adhik aakar-kar tha
 Tax on the trident wood: For those who collect wood from the forest for fuel, this tax was charged in kind
 pashu kar : pracheen bharat main pashu paalan pramukh vyavsaay tha, atah is par kar lagane kii parampara bhi thi
 Goats, sheep, cows, buffalo, etc
 were all taxed
 dar alag-alag thi
 Interest Tax: The king had the right to receive 32th part of the moneylender's interest as tax
 awasaiya evam vyavsaayik bhoomi par kar : is bhoomi par kar kii vahi dar honi chahie jo krishi bhoomi hetu tay ho
 Passenger tax: Manu mentions the tax on the waterway, while Venus on the landway
 sadako kii raksha, marammat tathaa safai ke liye yatriyon se kar lene kii vyavastha kii gai he
 Tax on handicraftsmen and artists: According to Venus, artisans and craftsmen should get free work done on one side in a day
 kar vyavastha ke sambandh main shukraniti main pratipaadit kiye gaye nishedhaatmak evam sakaaratmak niyamon ke uparyukt vivechan se spasht he ki shukraniti main rajya kii kar vyavastha ko ‘lok kalyankari‘ rajya kii apekshaaon ke anuroop swarup pradaan kiya gaya he
 Venus, while acknowledging the importance of justice, has included evil-grace in the king's 8 prime duties
 yah nyaayik prakriya praja ko dharm paalan main madad karti he
 It is the duty of the king to decide the cases properly and get the people to follow his decision powerfully
 shukr ne nyaay ke avadharanak paksh kii utani vistrut vyakhya nahin kii he, jaisi ki kautilya ke arthshaastra or manusmriti main uplabdh he
 Venus has detailed the institutional and procedural aspect of justice
 nyaaypalika ke sanghathan, nyaayik prakriya tathaa mukademon se sambandhit pakshon ke adhikaron evam dayitvon kaa vistaar se vivechan kiya he
 Venus mentions Raja and Sabha under judicial process and 'jury' is also mentioned to assist in special cases
 shukraniti main raja ko sampoorn nyaay vyavastha kaa pramukh nirnaayak athwa sarvocch adhikari mana gaya he, kintu yah spasht kar diya gaya he ki raja nyaaypalika kaa keval aupchaarik adhyaksh he
 Venus has expected the king to observe judicial functions in accordance with the scriptures
 raja dwaara akele hi sabhaasadon kii sahmati liye bina, nirnay lene ke gambheer dushprinaamon kaa bhi ullekh kiya he
 Sabha - Venus has called the Central Court of the state as Sabha or Nyaya Sabha
 sabha aisa sthaan he jahaan vyakti ke loukik aacharan evam hiton kii jaanch smriti ke kanoon ke anusaar kii jaati he
 Venus has mentioned ten such tools, with the help of which the assembly is able to do justice well
 ye das saadhan hai- According to Venus, the first place in the assembly is that of the king, who presides over the assembly
 raja sabha main apana pratinidhi niyukt kar saktaa he, jise shukr ne pradvivak kaha he, jo sabha ke alaava mantriparishad kaa bhi sadsy hota he
 Venus has accepted making members of the assembly from all castes along with giving priority to the Brahmin varna
 ambika prasad vaajapeyi ne kaha he, ‘‘ shukr ne sabhaasadon ke sambandh main ek vishesh siddhanth pradaan kiya he
 Those who have a dispute should be made councilors by their business, such as - farmers in the dispute of the farmers because they are more well aware of the rules of their business
 ‘‘ shukraniti kaa yah vivaran uski nyaay vyavastha ko adhik udaar tarksangat evam yathartwaadee banaata he
 Chief Justice: This is considered the highest judicial officer after Raja
 is pad par shukr ke anusaar aisa vyakti niyukt kiya janaa chahie
 Whose knowledge of law and science is very broad and special and whose fairness and loyalty is beyond doubt
 nyaayalay kaa carmik varg va saadhan : nyaayalay ko samuchit sankhya main karmchaaree va saadhan uplabdh hone chahie anyathaa nyaayalay apana kaary sucharu rup se nahin kar sakate
 Therefore Venus is of the opinion that the same court is sacred, in which all the necessary means are available for the decision of the case
 shukraniti main nyaayadhishon ke manamaane vyavhaar kaa nishedh kiya gaya he
 Some rules have been arranged for them
 raja ko nyaay karne ke apane karttavya kaa samuchit paalan karnaa chahie tathaa nyaay karte hue vibhinn jatiyon, shreniyon or kulon kii paramparaon ko maanate hue nirnay karnaa chahie evam dharm kaa paalan karnaa chahie
 Councilors must tell the truth in the assembly
 nyaayik prakriya ke samay raja yaa nyaayadhish ko vaadi ke prati sammanpurvak aacharan karnaa chahie
 Behavior: In simple terms, behavior means 'judicial process of trial in court'
 is nyaayik prakriya dwaara hi yah maaloom hota he ki koun vyakti apradhi he or koun nirparaadhi
 Phases of behavior: Venus has accepted four stages of the trial's judicial process
 kisi bhi mukademe kii shuruuaat purvapaksh ke likhit yaa maukhik bayaan se hoti he ki mukadmaa banataa he yaa nahin
 After this, the second phase starts the counterparty
 ab nyaayalay vaadi evam prativaadee donon se hi prashn evam pratiprashn karata he
 If the court realizes that a lawsuit is actually made in terms of law, then the case enters its third stage ie the action
 anyathaa use dwitiya paad main samaapt ho jaataa he
 Under the Action Footer, various evidence presented in the case is rigorously investigated and the truth and untruth contained in the lawsuit are obtained
 shukr ne sabhi pramaanon ke do mul prakaar bataae he - Venus has considered the divine proof to be less important than the Manusha proof and hence, in the absence of any kind of Manusha evidence, the Goddess proof is justified
 nyaayik prakriya kaa chauthaa or antim charan nirnay paad he
 Venus has given 6 types of decisions - shukr ke anusaar nirnay kii ghoshnaa ke saath hi vijeta paksh ko jayapatr diya janaa chahie
 It is also recognized as a legal document
 nyaayalay main vaadi evam prativaadee donon ko hi upasthit hona chahie
 Venus has also mentioned new arrangements such as rethinking honor, bail and niyogi, unlike its predecessors
 shukr ke anusaar niyogi ko kanoon kaa gyaan hona chahie evam use niyamanusaar hi shulk lenaa chahie
 Venus has mentioned ten types of crime - these include violation of the edict, killing a woman, stealing etc
 vastutah ye 10 aparaadh rajya, samaaj, naitikta evam dharm ke viruddh aparaadh he
 Venus has mentioned 50 types of fraud in punishable offenses
 shukr ne inhen raja ke prati kiye gayi aparaadh mana he
 Venus has divided all types of crimes into four basic categories - kayik aparaadh sharir se, vaachik aparaadh vaani se, maansik aparaadh man se evam sansaarik aparaadh kisi ke saath milakar yaa sahyog se kiya jaataa he
 Venus is of the opinion that the criminal should be punished only after knowing the gravity and smallness of each crime
 shukraniti main aparaadhon kii shreniyon kaa vistrut vargeekaran kiya gaya he, jo aparaadhon ke vishay main shukraniti ke vyavasthit, vyaavhaarik va vaigyanik drushtikon ko vyakt karata he
 Shukraniti has given importance to all types of crimes, social, economic, moral, political, and administrative, and requires their retaliation
 shukraniti main saamanytah prandand na dene kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he tathaa keval rajdroh jaise gambheer aparaadh ke liye vadh kaa dand pradaan kiye jane ke auchity kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 The word 'dand' has many meanings in ancient Indian tradition
 yahaan shukr ne dand ke do arth kiye he- Although elsewhere Venus has also accepted the meaning of punishment, army, war and justice system, in fact, punishment saves people from bad conduct
 raja kii dandyukt niti sabhi kaaryo kii siddhi karaati he or dand dharmon kaa param rakshak he
 Venus, like Manu and Yajnavalkya, has accepted the following four types of punishment in the context of judicial administration or abolition of crime - shukr ke anusaar keval uttam purush evam madhyam purush ko vaakdand yaa dhikdand diya janaa uchit he, adham purushon par inkaa sudharatmak prabhaav nahin padataa he, atah ye dand inke liye nahin he
 Venus has accepted the interrelationship of crime and punishment
 jo raja aparaadh va dand ke is sambandh kaa dhyaan rakhte hue kaary karata he, usase praja santusht rahati he
 Only the culprit is punishable
 nirparaadhi sadaiv adandaneey he
 The quantum of punishment should be according to the crime
 use manamaane thug se dandit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The king should not be too harsh in punishing
 shukr ne ek hi prakaar ke aparaadh ke liai uttam, madhyam, va adham purushon ke liye alag-alag dandon kii vyavastha kii he jisase shukr kii dand niti kaa vishamtavaadi paksh spasht hota he
 But Venus has also mentioned such crimes in which punishment is given to everyone equally, such as treason
 yah ullekhneey he ki shukr ne manu kii tulana main dand ke kshetra main adhik samtawadi vyavastha ko apanaaya he
 From the point of view of modern punishment theory, it can be said that Venus has not accepted the repressive punishment principle, but the obstructive, preventive and corrective punishment principles have definitely been accepted in Venus
 shukr ne pracheen bhartiya aacharyon kii parampara ke antargat hi ‘par-raashtra sambandhon’ arthath apane rajya evam anya rajyon ke aapasi sambandhon kaa vistrut vivechan prastut kiya he
 From the point of view of study, we can divide these ideas into two major parts - shukr ne kautilya ke samaan mandal siddhanth kaa ullekh nahin kiya, parantu chaar prakaar ke rajyon ke astitv ko sweekaar kiya he
 Venus has not considered their geographical position as the basis of the classification of the states, but has considered the position of the king of the Vizigishu and his kingdom among other states
 shukr ne pararashtra niti ke sanchaalan main rajait evam shakti tatv ko paryaapt mahatv diya he
 According to him, every king considers his king's interest as practicable and when the vigorous king makes efficient use of the measures of policy and the means of shaguna mantra according to his power with respect to other states
 shukr ke anusaar, jis prakaar raja dwaara sarp, hathi tathaa singh ko apane vash main kiya jaataa he, usee prakaar se raja ko yathayogy upayon se mitra tathaa shatru ko apana vashwarti bananaa chahie
 Venus has mentioned only four traditional measures of policy - sam niti kaa prayog, mitra va shatru donon ke viruddh hi kiya ja saktaa he
 Where friendship is stronger than the policy of peace and friendship
 vahiin shatru raja ke prati bhi sahaayta va sahyog nishchit hota he
 The use of feudalism towards the enemy is to increase the mutual security of the two states
 daan niti kaa prayog bhi shatru va mitra donon ke prati kiya jaataa he
 To say to a friend king that all my things, even life, is yours, is called a donation policy towards a friend
 shatru raja ko pratyaksh dhan dena uske prati daan niti kehalaati he
 Venus has considered the use of distinction policy against her friend inappropriate, but in some situations
 shatru raja ke prati teen prakaar se bhed niti kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he - In this, differences can be created between the enemy king and his royal subjects by additional distinction
 dandniti kaa prayog bhi mitra va shatru donon ke viruddh kiya ja saktaa hai
 To warn the friend king that if he behaves arbitrarily, i will not be your friend - it is a punishment policy
 jabaki shatru raja ke dosha prakat karnaa, dhan nasht karnaa, yuddh main ksht dena uske prati dand niti he
 Though the policy of discrimination and punishment against friendly kings by Venus can be called immoral, but it is their realistic policy
 shukr ke anusaar raja ko paryaapt soch-vichaar kar hi in chaaron niti upayon kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 Venus has considered the use of goodness and charity for the most powerful enemy, goodness and distinction for more powerful than her, use of distinction and punishment for those of equal strength
 iskaa arth he - 6 gun vaali vishisht dharna
 Although Venus, like Kautilya, has not discussed these qualities in detail
 iske 6 gun nimnlikhit hai- Treaty: - Venus has considered the treaty as a means by which the powerful enemy befriends the inferior king, that is, the inferior king gets protection
 sandhi ke mahatv ko rekhaankit karte hue kaha he, ‘‘jis prakaar se ghaney kaanto se ghire hue baanson ke samooh ko koi kaat yaa ukhaad nahin saktaa he, usee prakaar se mlecchon se bhi sandhi kiye hue raja ko bhi, koi parajeet nahin kar saktaa
 "venus is the only ancient Acharya, who considers the treaty even more than the non-aryan king to fulfill his interest
 vigrah :- vigrah kaa arth he - raajaaon ke madhya shaanti va sahyog kii niti kaa ant evam tanaav va sangharsh kaa armbh
 The act by which the enemy is victimized and subjugated is called Deity
 vastutah vigrah aisi niti he, jiske dwaara shaktishaalee raja, nirbal raja ko peedit karke, use bina pratyaksh yuddh ke hi, apane anusaar chalane ko vivash karata he
 This is the reason why the wise king should not believe even the enemy bound by treaty
 indra dwaara vritrasur-vadh kaa udhaaharan dete hue shukr ne kaha he ki indra ne droh na karne kii pratigya ke saath sandhi karke bhi aisa kiya tha
 But Venus has prohibited Deity from strong enemy
 keval raksha ke liye koi vikalp shesh na hone par hi ant main vigrah ko shukr ne uchit mana he
 Yan: - When the destruction of the enemy king is necessary for the attainment of his desired interest and he is attacked for this purpose, then it is called Yan
 yaan kaa nakaaratmak uddeshy he, shatru kaa naash karnaa
 But the positive objective is to achieve economic benefits and political gains
 keval shaktishaalee raja ko nirbal raja ke viruddh hi yaan kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 Asan: - Where other Acharyos have considered the meaning of Asan - a policy of neutrality and inaction, neglecting the enemy king
 shukr ne ise shatru raja ke kile yaa nagar kii aisi sainik gheraabandi mana he, jo swayan kii raksha karte hue shatru ko apni sharton par sampark ke liye vivash kare
 The logistics line of the enemy king is destroyed by the asana
 yuddh saamagree evam bhojan saamagree idhan aadi kii kami hone par shatru paksh main aantarik asantosh utpann hota he
 And then that enemy king is forced and accept subjugation
 aashray :- jab kisi shaktishaalee shatru raja dwaara nirbal raja kaa rajya nasht kar diya jaye athwa aisi paraajay kaa sankat aa jaye to nirbal raja ko apni raksha ke liye kisi anya shaktishaalee raja kaa aashray lenaa chahie, jisase uski shakti me vruddhi ho sake
 Dual sentiment: - It literally means to find two bhavas at the same time which are shown in the manifest form 
 gupt rup main usase thik vipareet aacharan kiya jaataa he
 It is characterized by friendly friendship and hostility in secret
 sena ke sanchaalan main bhi dwaidhi bhav kaa shukr ne ullekh kiya he
 It is bipartisan to divide the army into several columns and keep the enemy in clear form about his military force
 shukr ne vyaavhaarik sanchaalan kii drushti se chaar pramukh sansthagat sadhano kaa ullekh kiya he - Envoy: Venus has also been ranked among the 10 members of the Council of Ministers
 vah kootneeti evam videshniti se sambandhit kaaryon ko karata he
 He is such a traveling representative of the king who communicates with other kings
 atah use desh va kaal kii sthiti samajhane vaala bhaashan kala main kushal, anya kii hridayaagat bhaavana samajhane vaala evam nirbhik swabhaav kaa hona chahie
 Intelligence: In Shukraniti, there is no extensive mention of the system of intelligence like economics
 guptchar ke prakaaron ke vishay main bhi shukraniti maun he, guptchar prashasan bahya evam aantarik shatruon se raja evam rajya kii raksha kaa pramukh saadhan he
 The task of the detective is to know the behavior of the king's enemy servants and subjects and to inform the king about it
 raja ko bhi uski satyata kii pariksha karte rahanaa chahie tathaa asatywadee guptchar ko dandit karnaa chahie
 Army: According to Venus, army is a group of people, animals etc
, which are equipped with weapons and weapons
 sena ke kaaran hi shatru kaa naash sambhav hota he tathaa kosh, rajya va parakram kii vruddhi hoti he
 Venus has also considered military discipline and code of conduct
 raja ko sadaiv aise praytn karne chahie ki uski sena main bhed utpann na ho jabaki shatru sena main avashya hi bhed utpann ho
 The soldiers should also get the benefit of victory in war and keep them satisfied by participating in the spoils
 yuddh : shukr ne bahya chunautiyon se raksha ke liye or apane rajya ke vistaar ke liye yuddh kii aavashyaktaa ko sweekaar kiya he
 All kings aspire to expand the kingdom
 isliye paraspar shatruta bhi rakhte he
 According to Venus, when various measures of policy and even the mantra of mantra were not successful, then war should be adopted as the ultimate means
 shukraniti pracheen bhartiya granthon main sambhawatah ek maatr granth he, jisamen yuddh ko paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 According to Venus, the use of weapons by two kings is a war in a mutually hostile way

 Religion, war and diplomacy
 shukr ne dharm-yuddh ke naitik niyamon kaa vivaran diya he
 But, like Manu, he has not supported the superiority of the Dharma war over the Kootyuddha
 shukr kaa spasht mat he ki dharm yuddh yaa kuta yuddh jisamen shatru kaa vinaash ho vahi uchit he
 In fact Venus has given preference to the war of religion over the pseudo-religion by adopting a realistic approach
 shukr ne yuddh ko paapapurna evam jaghanya krity nahin mana, apitu ullekh kiya he ki yuddh main marane par kshatriya ko uttam fal kii prapti hoti he

 After that, please keep the enemy's subjects happy in every way and follow them just like your subjects
 shukr ne raja ko yah paraamarsh bhi diya he ki vah vijit rajya main karyrat mantri parishad ko hataakar apane prati nishtha rakhane vaale naveen mantri parishad kii niyukti kar de
 If he takes away the kingdom of the defeated king, then provide him, jagir etc
 for livelihood
 vijeta raja ko jite gaye rajya main swechhachari dhang se shashan nahin karnaa chahie
 He should be kept happy while protecting his daughter and make her his own

 Manu is basically a theological thinker, Kautilya is an economic thinker, while Venus is a political thinker

 Altekar's view is, "there are many such information of administrative importance in Shukraniti, which is not available in any other book including economics
 yah satya he ki shukr ne rajya ke saiddhanthik pakshon kii vistaar se vivechna nahin kii he, parantu pracheen bharat main vyaavhaarik paksh par hi prakaash daalane kii parampara thi
 Venus's contribution to facilitate study can be understood as the following points - dandniti ko sarvapramukh vidya ke rup main manyata :shukr ne dandniti shastreey aushanas sampradaay kaa anukaran karte hue saiddhanthik evam dharamshastreey gyaan par vyaavhaarik va loukik gyaan kii shreshthata ko pratipaadit kiya he

 is prakaar shukr ne janm par aadhaarit varna vyavastha main nihit swaarth evam ayogyata kii upeksha karne kii koshish kii he or karm, yogyata va pratibha ke aadhaar par varna vyavastha ke punah nirmaan kaa vichaar diya he
 Varna and caste are important in marriage and food community life
 raashtra prashasan jaise saarvajanik va raajnneetik kaary main varna evam jati kii tulana main karmsheel va gun par aadhaarit yogyata va visheshgyata kaa hi mahatv hota he
 Compared to Manu, the views of Venus are sufficiently liberal and point to the social change that was taking place in her era

 yah vargeekaran pracheen bharat kii rajtantratmak samrajyavaadee shashan pranali kii ore bhi sanket detaa he
 Reflections on Rajapada in a realistic way: Venus has not considered Raja as 'man Dev' like Manu
 shukr kaa spasht mat he ki rajpad kii samast garima ke uparant bhi raja multah praja kaa sevak hi hota he or isi rup main use kar praapt karne kaa adhikaar diya he
 Venus has considered subjects to be the basic duty of the king
 pracheen mantri parishad kaa viks : shukraniti hi ekmaatr aisa granth he, jisamen spasht rup se mantriyon ke variyata kram, unke vetan main antar, karyaalay aadi ko prakat kiya gaya he

 shukr ne hi sarvapratham mantri parishad kii sunishchit evam likhit karypranali kaa bhi spasht ullekh kiya he
 Treasury, Economy and Promotional State: It is noteworthy that Venus has only mentioned the concept of ideal kosha, ideal
 yah kosh itnaa sampann hona chahie ki kar jamaa na hone par bhi 20 varsh tak praja va sena kii raksha karne main samarth ho
 Venus is the only philosopher who has mentioned the state's annual plan of expenditure

 Venus has also emphasized on public welfare and social welfare in the details of its expenditure

 unhonen saamaanya vishram, avkaash, swasthya avkaash, pension sahit sevanivruti, paariwarik pension, bhavishya nidhi, bonus aadi kaa bhi ullekh kiya he
 Best description of administration of justice: Although Venus has followed the theological tradition in the administration of justice, but with this, he has mentioned some new elements in the administration of justice
 nyaay sabha ke liye sadsyta main keval brahyan varna kii anivaaryta nahin, juri pranali, samman, jamaanat, apil evam punah vichaar, niyogi aadi isamen sammilit he
 Theoretical and Realistic Explanation of per-nation Relations: While Manu is more idealistic in this field, Venus has accepted the mutual unreliability of states as the main basis of realistic relations
 unhone rajait evam shakti ke tatwon ko hi videsh niti ke sanchaalan main pramukh sthaan diya he, jo aadhunik kaal ke samaan he
 Although Venus has supported the idealistic side of the defeated king and the defeated state, the ultimate objective of such behavior is realistic
 aisi niti parajeet paksh par vijeta raja kii vijay ko sthayitv pradaan karti he
 Venus has clarified the distinction between the state and the nation and has clarified that control of the national community gives it the form of the state
 is prakaar shukr ne apane yug kii rajtantratmak shashan pranali ke antargat paae jane vaali raajnneetik vyavastha kaa vistrut vivaran prastut kiya he
 Beni Prasad is of the opinion that Shukranitisar is such a very important book written in ancient Hindu social and political tradition, which has touched all the subjects and also made them rich and prosperous
