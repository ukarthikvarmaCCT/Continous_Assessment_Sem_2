 Raman scattering or the Raman effect is about the flexible distribution of photon particles
 isaki khoj prasiddh bhartiya vaigyanik shri si ve raman ne kii thi
 According to Raman effect, when a monochromatic light passes through liquids and solids, the light of some other characters of very low intensity is seen along with the incident light in it
 1930 main bhautikee kaa nobel puraskaar chandrasekhar venkataramana ko unke is khoj ke liye pradaan kiya gaya tha

 Initially Raman passed through the purple light beam Punj, obtained by passing the sunlight through a violet filter
 nirgat prakaash punj mukhyatah to bangnee rang kaa hi tha, parantu ise hare filter se gujaarne par isamen bahut kam pariman main hari kirnon kaa astitv bhi dekhne main aayaa
 The Raman effect is also important for understanding the internal structure of chemical compounds

 But Raman knew that unless the wavelengths of Raman-lines and their relative intensity were measured, neither the effect could be satisfactorily explained nor recognized in the scientific world
 iske liye unhone ek quartj spectrograph kaa upyog kiya, jiske parimanatmak parinaam march 31, 1928 ke indian jarnal of physics main prakashit hue
 This is a wonderful effect, only a decade after its discovery the internal structure of 2000 chemical compounds was determined

 According to Raman effect, the nature and nature of light changes when it passes through a transparent medium
 yah madhyam thos, drav or gasiy, kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 This phenomenon occurs when the molecules of the medium scatter particles of light energy
 yah usee tarah hota he jaise kairam board par striker gotiyon ko chhitara detaa he
 The intrinsic molecule structure of the medium can be detected by minimal changes in the photon's energy or the nature of light

 Lord Raley successfully interpreted the blue color of the sky on the basis of light-dispersion from airborne particles, but he considered the blue color of ocean water to be a reflection of the sky in water
 raman ko yah vyakhya sweekaarya nahin thi
 He believed that the principle which was responsible for the blue color of air should also be for the blue color of water, therefore, he carried a JB spectrometer with him on his return journey

 unhone 'nechar ko ek chota lekh is sambandh main bheja or yuva vaigyanikon ke apane dal ke saath prakaash-prakirnan sambandhi apane prayogon main leen ho gaye
 He announced the Raman effect on February 28, 1928, after 7 years of tireless work and light-scattering from hundreds of liquids and solids
 1987 se bharat main yah din rashtriya vigyaan diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 The Raman effect can be appropriately interpreted only on the basis of quantum theory, where a monochromatic light beam is seen as the flow of particles containing energy
 ye photon jab madhyam ke kanon se takaraate hai to unamem yaa to pratyasth sanghatt hota he jisase anivarytah aaptit aavriti kii hi tarangen utsarjit hoti hai yaa phir apratyasth sanghatt hota he jisase aaptit vikiranon se adhik tarangadairdhya kii spectrumi rekhaaen bhi praapt ho sakati hai or kam tarangadairdhya kii spectrumi rekhaaen bhi
 The process of radiation received from unpredictable collisions is called Raman scattering and the resulting spectral lines are called 'raman lines'

 Then gradually physicists started losing interest in this new technique
 par tab tak rasayanagyon ke bich ek vishleshnatak aujaar ke rup main yah takanic lokapriy hone lagi thi
 Every substance has its own specific spectrum as a tool of chemists
 atah padaarth ko nasht kiye bina mishranon kaa bhi rasinic vishleshan is takanic dwaara kiya ja saktaa tha or padaarth carbonic ho yaa acarbonic uske hastakshar raman spectrum main pahachaane ja sakate the
 Also the presence of their relative magnitude could be estimated by comparing the intensity of the spectral lines
 yah ek vyapak takanic thi or iskaa upyog dravon ke atirikt gaison or thoson ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa tha
 But after World War II, due to the developments in sensitive detectors and electronics, scientists began to find infrared spectrometry simpler than Raman spectrometry and the trend towards applications of Raman effect decreased somewhat
 kintu lesar kii khoj ke baad 1960 se raman prabhaav phir se vaigyanik anveshakon main lokapriy ho gaya
 The most difficult problem in detecting the Raman effect was that the Raman lines were very weak, so a very strong light source was required for their detection
 lesar ne na keval aisa atyant teevr prakaash strot pradaan kiya varan prakirnit prakaash main aise nae prabhaav pravartit kiye jinhone raman spectrummiti main nae aayam jod die
 As a result, many variations of Raman spectroscopy developed

 Many different Raman spectrum techniques have been developed with the integration of these concepts

 The Raman effect provides the most effective technique wherever a particle-specific particle can be identified and quickly extracted without damaging the sample
 abhinav raman spectrummiti ke kuch anuprayog neeche die gaye hai : The applications of Raman effect have been increasing with time and this shows the importance of the legacy of Raman effect in the 21st century

 It is a retired Russian astronaut and politician who became a prominent member of the Communist Party after the dissolution of the first group of female astronauts in 1969
 inkaa janm 6 march 1937 ko hua tha
 The first space flight of Valentina Tereshkova began on 6 June 1963 in Vostok 6
 or apni antariksh kii pehali yatra main inhone 3 dinon main prithvi ke 48 grahapath puure kiye the
 She was first inducted into the Soviet Air Force to join the Astronaut Corps and was subsequently elected the first female civilian to fly into space

 is aavesh ko kam kar shunya kar dena vidhruvikaran kehalaata he jo koshika ke tantra ko kriyasheel karata he jo ise sikudne ke liye prerit karata he
 During each heartbeat, there is a systematic gradual increase of the wave of depolarization in a healthy heart that is activated by the cells of the sinus-auricle, separated through the atrium, from the "endodermic conduction path"
 It passes through and then spreads throughout the ventricle

 , The right arm and the left leg form electrical conductive pairs: LA + RA, LA + LL, RA + LL) The output obtained from each pair is called a lead
 kaha jaataa he ki prayek lead hriday par vibhinn drushtikon se dekhte hai
 Different types of ecgs can be indicated by the number of leads recorded, for example 3-lead, 5-lead or 12-lead ECG
 a 12-lead ECG is one in which 12 different electrical signals are recorded at approximately the same time and will often be used as one-time recordings of the ECG, usually printed as a paper copy
 3- or 5-lead vaale isiji main nirantar nirikshan kiye jane evam ek upyukt anuvikshan upkaran ke screen par dekhe jane kii pravriti hoti he, udhaaharan ke liye ek shalya-chikitsa ke dauraan yaa ek ambulance main pahunchaae jane tak

 It is the best way to measure and diagnose abnormal rhythms of the heart, particularly abnormal rhythms caused by damage to the convection tissue that carries electrical signals, or abnormal rhythms generated by electrolytic imbalances
 In myocardial infarction, the ECG can identify damage to the heart muscle in specific areas, although it does not cover all areas of the heart
 isiji vishwasaneey rup se hriday ke pump karne kii kshamta kii maap nahin kar saktaa he, jiske liye paradhvani yaa ultrasound aadhaarit yaa anvik aushadhi pareekshanon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 It is possible to have a normal ECG signal during a heart rate stop
 kaha jaataa he ki 1872 main saint bartholomiu hospital main doctor of science kii oopaadhi praapt karne ke liye adhyayan karte samay marij ke hriday kii dhadkan kaa record praapt karne ke liye alexander muirhed ne jvergrast marij kii kalai main taar sanlagn kiya

 By keeping the paper speed at 25 mm / sec, the ECG converts a small block of paper into a speed of 40 milliseconds
 paanch chote block milakar ek bade block banaate he, jo 200 milisecond main parivartit karata he
 Therefore, there are five large blocks per second

 It is usually possible to change this orientation so it is necessary to check the labels to see which leads are represented
 aam taur par prayek kollam teen leedon ke liye samay main samaan kshan record karenge evam phir recording agle kollam main sthanantarit ho jayega jo us bindu ke baad hriday kii dhadakanon ko record karegaa
 It is possible for heart rhythms to convert between columns of lead

 The term "lead" in electromagnetism causes a lot of confusion because it is used to indicate two different things
 aam bhashaa ke anusaar lead shabd kaa prayog vidyut chaalkon ko isiji recorder ke saath jodne vaale vidyut cabel ko suchit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 As such, it may be acceptable to mention the "left-handed lead" as the electric driver that should be connected near the left arm
 ek maanak "12-lead" vaale isiji main aam taur par das vidyut chaalak hote hai
 Alternatively, the term lead can indicate the difference of voltages between two electrical conductors and the detection of what is actually produced by the ECG recorder
 prayek kaa ek vishisht naam hoga
 For example, "lead I" is the voltage between the right-arm electrical conductor and the left-arm electrode, while "lead II" is the voltage between the right limb and the foot
 is prakaar ke lead "12-lead" vaale isiji kaa nirmaan karte hai
 To create additional confusion, the "limb lead" typically informs the accounting records obtained from leads I, II and III, rather than the electrical drivers attached to the limb

 Usually the conductors consist of a conductor gel, which is embedded in the middle of a self-adhesive pad into which the cable is clipped

 It consists of an rv4 lead which uses equivalent values of V4 on the right side of the chest wall and extends the chest lead through V7, V8 and V9 on the back
 5- or 12-lead vaale donon vinyas main, lead I, II evam III limb lead kehalaate hai
 The electrical conductors that produce these signals are located on the limb - one on each arm and one on the left leg
 Limb leads form dots known as Enthoven's triangles

 There are two types of lead: unipolar and bipolar
 Bipolar leads have one positive and one negative pole
 ek 12-lead vaale isiji main, limb lead dwidhruvi lead hote hai
 The unipolar lead also has two poles, such that the voltage is measured; However, the minus pole is a composite pole made up of the signals of many other electrical drivers
 12-lead vaale isiji main, limb lead ke atirikt sabhi ekadhruviya hote hai
 Wilson's central terminal VW RA; LA; And LL electric conductors are drawn together, through a network of common resistance capacitance, by connecting the electrical conductors so that the average potential across the entire body is imposed, which is approximately the potential in infinity
 aavr, avl or avf lead sanvardhit lead hai
 They are taken from the same three electric drivers as leads I, II and III
 haalanki, ve hriday ko vibhinn konon se dekhte hai kyonki in leedon ke liye rinatmak vidyut chaalak wilson ke kendriya terminal kaa roopantaran he
 This debt neutralizes the power driver and allows the positive power drivers to become "investigative electric drivers"
 yah sambhav he kyonki eenthoven kaa niyam kahata he ki i + + III = 0
 sameekaran ko yah bhi likhaa ja saktaa i + III = II
 ise is prakaar likhaa jaataa he kyonki eenthoven ne eenthoven ke trikon main lead II kii dhruviyata ko purnataya badal diya, shaayad isliye ki ve sidhe kyuares samashtiyon ko dekhnaa chaahate the
 Wilson's central terminal paved the way for the development of augmented limb leads avr, avl, avf and the priestly leads V1, V2, V3, V4, V5 and V6
 sanvardhit limb lead avr, avl, evam avf ko is prakaar se vistaarit kiya jaataa he kyonki rinatmak vidyut chaalak wilson kaa kendriya terminal rahane par sanket atyadhik chota hone ke kaaran upyogi nahin hota he
 Along with leads I, II, and III, augmented leads avr, avl, and avf form the basis of a six-axis reference system, which is used to calculate the electrical axis of the heart in the anterior plane
 avr, avl, evam avf lead ko i evam II limb lead kaa prayog kar bhi vyakt kiya ja saktaa he: Electric drivers are installed directly on the chest for the priestly leads
 hriday se unki sannikatataa ke kaaran, unamem sanvardhan kii jarurat nahin hoti he
 Wilson's central terminal is used for negative electric conductors and these leads are considered unipolar
 The priestly leads observe the electrical activity of the heart in the so-called horizontal plane
 kshaitij tal main hriday ke vaidyut aksh ko z aksh ke rup main suchit kiya jaataa he
 a typical ECG tracing of the cardiac cycle consists of a p wave, a QRS macro, a t wave, and a u wave normally seen in 50 to 75% ECG
 vidyutahridlekh kii aadhaar-rekha voltata ko samavidyutvibhav rekha kaha jaataa he
 Typically the isoelectric line is measured as part of the trajectory of the t wave and the tracing preceding the next p wave
 multah chaar vichlan the, lekin aarambhik amplifire dwaara shuru kiye gaye ganitiya sanshodhan ke baad, paanch vichalnon kaa khoj kiya gaya
 Enthoven chose the letters P, Q, R, s and t to identify tracing that were overlaid on unmodified labeled A, B, c and D
 isiji kii vyakhya is vichaar par nirbhar karti he ki alag-alag lead hriday ko alag-alag "drushtikonon" se dekhte hai
 This has two benefits
 sabase pehle, samasya darshane vaale lead kaa prayog yah anumaan lagane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he ki hriday kaa koun sa pradesh prabhavit he
 Secondly, the overall direction of travel of the wave of depolarization can also be estimated which may reveal other problems
 ise hriday sambandhi aksh kaha jaataa he
 The determination of the cardiac axis depends on the concept of a vector that describes the speed of the depolarization wave
 tab is sadish kaa iske ghatakon ke rup main vichaar kiye gaye lead kii disha ke sambandh main varnan kiya ja saktaa he
 One component will be in the direction of lead and it will be revealed in the behavior of QRS macro and one component will be at 90 degree from it
 The positive net deflection of the QRS macro suggests that the polarization wave is propagating through the heart in the direction that some components are in the direction of the lead itself
 hriday kaa vidyutiya aksh lalaat tal main hriday ke vidhruvikaran tarangagra kii saamaanya disha ko suchit karata he
 Through a healthy circulatory system, the cardiac axis is related to the part where the major muscle mass of the heart is located
 aam taur par yah daanye nilay kii kuch bhoomika ke saath baanyaa nilay hota he
 It is usually oriented in the right shoulder in the direction of the left foot, corresponding to the left lower quadrant of the six-axial reference system, although −30 ° to + 90 ° is considered normal
 yadi baanyaa nilay apni gatividhi yaa vishaal aakaar main vruddhi karata he to ise "baanye aksh kaa vichlan" kaha jaataa he kyonki aksh baanyein ore shighrata ke saath -30° se adhik mud jaataa he, vaikalpik rup se un sthitiyon main jahaan daanyaa nilay tanaavpurnya vibruddhigrast hota he tab aksh +90° se adhik mud jaataa he evam kaha jaataa he ki "daanyaa aksh vikshepan" maujuud hai
 Disorders of the heart's conduction system can disrupt the electrical axis without showing significant changes in the large size of the muscle

 There are a total of twelve leads, each of which records the electrical activity of the heart from various perspectives, related to various anatomical regions of the heart with the aim of identifying severe cardiovascular anemia or injury 
 kaha jaataa he ki do lead jo hriday ke nikatavarti shaareerik kshetron ko dekhte hai ve sate hue hote hai isaki praasangikta is baat kaa nirdhaaran karne main he ki kya isiji main asaamanyata sahi rog yaa mithyaa nishkarsh darsha sakate hai
 In addition, any two priestly leads that lie next to each other are considered contiguous
 udhaaharan ke liye, haalanki V4 ek agr lead or V5 ek parshv lead he, ve sate hue hote hai kyonki ve ek-duusare ke bagal main sthit hote hai
 Lead avr does not provide any specific view of the left ventricle

 Modern ECG monitors provide diverse filters for signal processing
 sabase aam samaayojan monitor mod or naidanik mod hai
 In monitor mode, the low frequency filter is adjusted to either 0
5 Hz or 1 Hz and the high frequency filter is adjusted to 40 Hz
 yah kritak niyamit hriday taal ke nirikshan ko simit karata he
 The high-pass filter helps to reduce the unstable baseline and the low-pass filter helps to reduce the noise with a power line of 50 or 60 Hz
 In the diagnostic mode, the high pass filter is adjusted to 0
05 Hz, which allows the accurate ST segment to be recorded
 nimna-paas filter ko 40, 100, yaa 150 hertz par samyojit kiya jaataa he
 As a result, the monitor mode performance of the ECG is more filtered than the diagnostic mode, because its passband is more thin

 Purvanchal Rural Development Bank Limited prayojanavaad yaa falanumeyapramanyawad yaa vyavahaarwad angareji ke "pregametism" kaa samanarthvachi shabd he or pregametism shabd unani bhashaa ke 'pragma' shabd se bana he, jiskaa arth "kriya" yaa "karm" hota he
 Accordingly, "consequentialism" is an ideology that gives its functional influence or fruit a very important place in all fields of knowledge
 iske anusaar hamaari sabhi vastuvishyak dharanaayen unke sambhav vyaavhaarik parinaamon kii hi dharanaayen hoti hai
 Therefore, to get any thing or idea right, it is necessary to test its practical results
 prayojanavaad ek naveentam darshanik vichaardhaara he
 In the present era, this ideology is the most recognized among the various ideologies of philosophy and education
 yatharthwaad hi ek aisi vichaardhaara he jiskaa bijaropan maanav-mastishk main ati pracheen kaal main hi ho gaya tha
 Realism, rather than a name of a well-formed philosophical ideology, represents all ideas that believe that the object exists independently
 adarshavaadi yah maanata he ki ‘vastu’ kaa astitv hamaare gyaan par nirbhar karata he
 If this idea is correct then the object has no position
 iske thik vipareet yathartwaadee maanate hai ki vastu kaa swatantra astitv he chaahe vah hamaare vichaaron main ho athwa nahin
 Both the object and its related knowledge are separate entities
 sansar main anek aisi vastuein hai jinke sambandh main hamen jaankaree nahin he parantu iskaa arth yah nahin he ki ve astitv main he hi nahin
 This is to say that the object has an independent position
 hamaara gyaan hamako uski sthiti se avgat karaata he parantu uske bare main hamaara gyaan na hone se uskaa astitv nasht nahin ho jaataa
 In the same way, realistic about the means of acquiring knowledge, scientific method like Purposeism considers only the best method and takes shelter of incorporation method
 prayojanavaadee vichaardhaara kaa udbhav kab hua tha yah to nishchit rup se nahin kaha ja saktaa, kintu phir bhi is vichaardhaara kii vishistataa ko dhyaan main rakhte hue yah avashya hi kaha ja saktaa he ki jab se manushya ne apni samasyaon evam kathinaaiyon ke kaarnon evam unke samaadhaan ke liye kiye gayi prayaason se praapt anubhavon kii satyata evam vyaavhaarikta ke sambandh main chintan prarambh kiya tabhi se is vichaardhaara kaa bijaropan ho gaya tha
 Certain proponents of this theory relate it to the Greek thinker Protagoras's "man is the measure of all things" - and also to the ancient philosophers, such as Socrates and Aristotle, as users of the Pregomatic method; But in reality it is a modern ideology and its principal proponents are the famous psychologist of America, William James, educationist John Dewey and Dr

 america ke suprasiddh vichaarak charles sanders piers ne prayojanavaad ke aadhunik rup ko janm diya
 Pierce's work was further enhanced by William James and gave him clarity and comprehensiveness
 isliye anek log wiliam james ko hi prayojanavaad ke aadhunik swaroop kaa janmdata maanate hai
 John DV in America and Schiller in England were its main supporters and campaigners
 prayojanavaad athwa prayogwaad kaa janm america logon ke rahan- sahan tathaa vichaar prakriya ke falswaroop hua
 Because people fleeing Europe and England for religious freedom started believing in a peculiar functionality due to America's border-related freedom, so no ideology, other than for the hard-working beings to create new life, away from the digression of cultural values
 Was not suitable america jivan kaa yah ‘vaad’ pratibimb he
 This new philosophy was given full maturity by the greatest philanthropist, expert and propagator, the great philosopher, teacher and educationist John DV and therefore he is considered representative of Puritanism
 dow shiller ne maanviyatawad naamak siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya he jise vastav main falanumeyapramanyawad kii ek shakha hi samajhnaa chahie
 Almost all of James's works are based on this ideology
 james praaia: aadhyatmavaad ke, visheshtya hegely aadhyatmavaad ke, kattar virdohi the
 It would not be inappropriate to call him an ideological representative of the usable and outlandish American people
 jab vah satya ke ek aise maapdand ke vichaar main lage the jo aadhyatmavaadi maapdand se sarvatha bhinn ho, unhone janvari, san 1878 i
 ke "paupular science" naamak ek amareeki masikpatr main, charles peers likhit "ham apane vichaaron ko spasht kaise banaaen" - lekh padhaa or usamen adhanik falanumey pramanyawad kii moolbhoot ruparekha paakar unhen yah vishwaas ho gaya ki satya yaa satyagyan kii kasuti yahi he
 To Peers, as he himself has stated, both the term "pragmatism" and its expressions of consequentialism were met with the works of the famous philosopher Kant of Germany
 parantu is vichaardhaara kii pracheenta pradarshit karte hue bhi james ne apane ko vishesh rup se peers kaa hi abhaari mana he or unhen darshanajagat main aadhunik falanumeyapramanyawad kaa pravartak kahkar sammanit kiya he
 In any case, James himself is the most notable name in giving this theory strength and fame
 unke likhe hue "manovigyaan ke siddhant", "dharmik anubhav ke vividh rup", "falanumeyapramanyawad", "satya kaa arth" or "nanaatmak vishwa" aadi sabhi prakhyat granth is vichaardhaara kaa samarthan karte hai
 Not only his logical thoughts, but psychological and elemental - all kinds of ideas are clear symbols of the consequentialist tendency
 james ke anusaar "satya un sab baton kaa naam he jo vishwaas ke maarg main, tathaa nishchit nirdishtavy hetuon se bhi, apane aapako shreshth siddh karti hai"
 In short, "truth is only a worthy or appropriate tool of the thought process, just as" auspicious "is only a successful instrument of our practical life; it is somehow beneficial and, in fact, ultimately and all things Keeping in mind is beneficial
 " james satya ko hamaari nijee dharanaon kaa nakad mulya maanate hai, vastugat tathy nahin
 According to them, we create our own truths
 ve bahya vastuon kii pratikriya maatr nahin; kintu hamaare prayojanon ke sadhak hamaare hi vishwaas hote hai
 We tend to believe those beliefs that give us emotional fulfillment or practical success to be true, and vice versa as false
 at: hamaare vishwaason yaa vichaaron kaa satyatv unke fal yaa parinaam dwaara anumey hota he
 It takes time and experience to establish
 jaise jaise hamen kisi vishwaas se vyavhaar main safalataa milti jaati he vaise hi vaise uskaa satyatv bhi badhata jaataa he
 None of our beliefs, as evidenced by our limited experience, has the right to be called absolutely true, even the so-called natural laws of science cannot be called absolutely true
 hamen adhik se adhik yahi kehane kaa adhikaar he ki jahaan tak hamaare ab tak ke anubhavon kaa sabandh he, ve satya siddh hue hai; parantu isse unki shaashvat satyata pramanit nahin hoti
 a complete experience, which is never possible, is expected for complete truth
 at: maanav dwaara pratipaadit koi bhi satya, chaahe vah vaigyanik ho chaahe vah vaigyanik ho chaahe taarkik, purna satya nahin ho saktaa
 Those who often perceive the siddha-satya or principle, are considered to be only a sub-concept of the result
 ve buddhivaadee tarkshastra kii kadi aalochana karte hai or unke nyayavakya aadi siddhanton ko dooshit tehraate hai
 They always consider human ideas to be ideological, not selfless, against the beliefs of rational rationalists
 gyaan ke satyatvasatyatv ke pareekshan kii bhartiya nyaayadarshan kii "pravritisamarthy va pravritivisamvaad" naamak vidhi, jiske anusaar kaary main pravrutt hone par safalataa pradaayak gyaan ko yatharth tathaa vifaltaajanak gyaan ko ayatharth yaa mithyaa mana jaataa he, is falanumeyapramanyawaadee vidhi se milti julati maaloom hoti he
 But, at the same time, the staunch objectivist jurist saying "tadvati tatrakarak jnanam realam" and tadabhavati tatakarak jnanam illusion: "james" seems to be bitterly criticized by Western Western philanthropists
 jis prakaar satyasty vivechan main, usee prakaar maansik prakriyaaon yaa vichaaron kii vyakhya main bhi falanumeyapramanyawaadee hamaari prayojnatmak kriyaaon ko hi pramukh sthaan pradaan karte hai
 According to him, we produce not only our truths but also diverse experiences
 hamaara praathmik athwa, moolbhoot anubhav ek avichhinn dhara jaisaa hota he or ham swaprayojanon evam swaarthon se prerit hokar, vishleshan tathaa chunaav aadi karne kii apni maansik kriyaaon dwaara, uskaa vibhaajan, vibhinn padaarthon tathaa unke parsparik sambandhon ke rup main, kar liya karte he
 Thus, in his psychology and Locke's atomistic psychology, according to which our ideas are considered to be a mechanically stored sequence of initial simple suffixes, there is a fundamental difference
 falanumeyapramanyawaadiyon kii drushti main parmanuwaadi manovigyaan isi naam ke bhautik vigyaan kii nakal he jo vaastaviktaa se dur evam bhraamak he
 There is no scientific consensus among those who accept the consequent holistic method of testing the truthfulness of beliefs or ideas
 phir bhi, yadi kisi tatvagyan ko is vichaardhaara kaa praturup kaha ja saktaa he to vah he pro dyui dwaara samarthit dow shiller kaa "studies in humanism" naamak pustak main pratipaadit tathvik siddhant
 According to this, we always keep creating reality to a large extent and in the true sense, because every and every real thing depends on our knowledge related to it
 koi bhi gyaat padaarth aisa nahin hota jiskaa swaroop hamaare dwaara uske gyaat hone se, vishesh rup se, nirdhaarit evam nirmit na hota ho
 We do not know what altruism is, and nothing can be said about it, of course
 parantu jahaan tak gyaat vaastaviktaa kaa nirmaan karte rahete hai, kyonki prayek tathakthi yatharth vastu hamaare tatsambandhi gyaan par ashrith rahati he
 There is no known substance whose form is not determined and created by us, especially by its being known
 parmaarthiktaa kya he yah ham nahin jaanate or na uske vishay main, nishchay rup se, kuch kaha hi ja saktaa he
 But as far as known reality is concerned, it is decided that its form of creation depends, in a very important part, on our knowledge and on our knowledge on which our motives and interests are imprinted
 hamaare tathy ve hi hote hai jinamein unki nirmaapika main hamaari ichchhaaon ko trupt karne kii shakti yaa yogyata hoti he
 Just as truths are our successful beliefs, facts are the material that give satisfaction to our desires
 sankshep main hamaare vyaavhaarik jivan main safal kriyaatmak prabhavotpaadakta ko hi, in vichaarkon ke anusaar, tathyata yaa vaastaviktaa kaa lakshan samajhnaa chahie
 Indian Buddhist philosophy's definition of satta, according to which "satya is that which has the potential to produce an action", seems to be compatible with the consequentialist ideology, because it also contains the functions of the objects in determining their existence, existence, existence

 chandragupta vikramaditya gupt rajvansh kaa raja
 Chandragupta the second great who is known as Vikramaditya or Chandragupta Vikramaditya in Sanskrit; Was a great powerful emperor of the Gupta dynasty
 unka rajya 380-412 i tak chalaa jisamen gupt rajvansh ne apana shikhar praapt kiya
 That period of the Gupta Empire is also called the Golden Age of India
 chandragupta dwitiya mahaan apane purv raja samudragupta mahaan ke putr the
 He achieved success by following an aggressive expansion policy and beneficial accession policy
 chandragupta dwitiya vikramaditya samudragupta ke eran abhilekh se spasht he ki unke bahut se putr pautra the, kintu apane antim samay main unhone chandragupta ko apana uttaradhikari niyukt kiya
 It is also evident from the records of Chandragupta II and the later Guptasamrats that after the death of Samudragupta, only Chandragupta II became Guptasamrat
 kintu iske vipareet, anshrup main uplabdh 'devichandraguptam' evam katipay anya saahitiyik tathaa puratathvik abhilekh sambandhi pramaanon ke aadhaar par kuch vidvan ramgupta ko samudragupta kaa uttaradhikari pramanit karte hai
 Taking advantage of the disqualification of Ramgupta, Chandragupta defeated both his kingdom and the queen
 ramgupta kii aitihaasikta sandigdh he
 Ramgupta of copper coins obtained from Bhilsa etc
 must have been a local ruler of that region
 chandragupta dwitiya kii tithi kaa nirdhaaran unke abhilekhon aadi ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Chandragupta's, inscribed Mathura pillar inscription in 61, was written in the fifth year of his kingdom
 falat: unka rajarohan guptasanwat 61-5= 56= 375 i
 main hua
 The last known date of Chandragupta II is found on his Rajatamudras - Guptasamvat 90+ 0 = 409- 410 AD
 isse anumaan kar sakate hai ki chandragupta sambhavat: uparilikhit varsh tak shashan kar rahe the
 In contrast, the first known date of Kumaragupta i is found in the Gupta era 96 = 415 AD, from his Bilsand inscription
 is adhar par, aisa anumaan kiya jaataa he ki, chandragupta dwitiya ke shasankaal kaa samaapan 413-14 i
 main hua hoga
 Devagupta and Devaraja-other names seem to be known from various articles of Chandragupta II
 abhilekhon evam mudralekhon se unki vibhinn oopaadhiyon- maharajaadhiraj, parambhagwat, shrivikram, narendrachandra, narendrasingh, vikramank ev vikramaditya aadi- kaa gyaan hota he
 His first military campaign was against the Saka satraps of Saurashtra
 sangharsh prakriya evam anya sambhddha vishyon kaa vistrut gyaan uplabdh nahin hota
 It is clear from Chandragupta's Udayagiri cavalry of the Sandhivagrihaka Veerasena Shaab, that he intended to reach the whole earth
 isi sthaan se praapt chandragupta ke samant shaasha sankanik maharaj ke guptasanwat 82 ke lekh tathaa amrakardav naam ke sainyadhikari ke sanchi guptasanwat 93 ke shilaalekh se maalav pradesh main unki deergh-upasthiti pratyaksh hoti he

 The last date known from Shaka currencies appears to be 388 AD
 iske vipareet in sikkon se gyaat chandragupta kii pratham tithi guptasanwat 90+ 0 he
 As a result, it can be inferred that Chandragupta's national victory would have been almost entirely successful only after 409 AD after 20 years of long war
 chandragupta ke senadhyaksh amrakardav, apane sanchi abhilekh main swayan ko, anek samarawaptvijayyashasupatak: kehete hai
 It can also be inferred from the mention of these many summers that Chandragupta must have fought other wars besides Shakya war
 kintu vartmaan sthiti main unka vivechan apramanit he
 a lunar triumph is engraved on the iron pillar at the side of Qutub Minar in Delhi
 chandra kii pahchaan pracheen bharat ke vibhinn samraaton se kii jaati rahi he
