 hindi bhashaa kii unnati unka moolmantra tha - In his testimony before the Education Commission in 1882, on the importance of making Hindi the language of the courts, he said- isi sandarbh main 1868 i main 'urdu kaa syapa' nium se unhone ek vyangy kavita likhi- Due to these works, Bharatendu became a grand constellation of Hindi literature and his era became known as Bharatendu era
 harishchandra chandrika, kavivachansudha, harishchandr megsine, stri bala bodhini jaise prakaashan unke vichaarsheel or pragatisheel sampadakeey drushtikon kaa parichay dete hai
 The most important work of Bharatendu is that he inspired Hindi literature, and with it, society to move in anti-imperial direction
 1870 main jab kavivachansudha main unhone lord mayo ko lakshya karke 'levi praan levi' naamak lekh likhaa tab se hindi sahitya main ek nayi samrajya-virdohi chetana kaa prasar armbh hua
 On 6 July 1874, he wrote in Kavibhasudha that in the same way as America became colonized and became independent, in the same way India can also gain independence
 unhone tadeey samaaj kii sthapana kii jiske sadsy swadeshi vastuon ke vyavhaar or videshi vastuon ke bahishkaar kii pratigya karte the
 The Swadeshi manifesto published in the 'kavikavasudha' dated March 23, 1874, by Bhartendu, appealing for the boycott of luxury clothes, became the pledge letter of the entire Hindi society
 usamen bhaaratendu ne kaha tha, First of all, Bharatendu Harishchandra gave voice to public sentiments and aspirations in literature
 pehali baar sahitya main 'jan' kaa samavesh bharatendu ne hi kiya
 His first poetry was dominated by ritualistic tendencies
 sahitya patansheel saamanti samskruti kaa poshak ban gaya tha, par bharatendu ne sahitya ko janata kii garibi, paradheenata, videshi shaskaon ke amanviya shoshan ke chithran or uske virodh kaa madhyam bana diya
 Through his plays, poems, reticent and slurs, he attacked and attacked the British Raj, due to which he also had to become a partisan of the British
 bhaaratendu angrejon ke shoshan tantra ko bhalee-bhaanti samajhate the
 In his magazine Kavikavasudha, he wrote - yahi nahin, 20veen sadi kii shuruyaat main dadabhai nauroji ne dhan ke apvahan yani dren of velth ke jis siddhanth ko prastut kiya tha, bharatendu ne bahut pehle hi shoshan ke is rup ko samaj liya tha
 she wrote - angrej bharat kaa dhan apane yahaan lekar chale jate hai or yahi desh kii janata kii garibi or kashton kaa mul kaaran he, is sachai ko bhaaratendu ne samaj liya tha
 In Kavikavasudha, he called upon the public - bharatendu kii vaishvik chetana bhi atyant prakhar thi
 He was well aware of which countries of the world are progressing and how much
 isliye unhone san 1884 main baliya ke dadri meley main 'bharatvarshonnati kaise ho sakati he' par atyant sargarbhit bhaashan diya tha
 This article is also a reflection of his very progressive thinking
 isamen unhone logon se kuritiyon or andhvishwaason ko tyagkar acchhee-se-acchhee shiksha praapt karne, udyog-dhandhon ko viksit karne, sahyog evam ekta par bal dene tathaa sabhi kshetron main aatmanirbhar hone kaa aahvaan kiya tha
 Bharatendu's speech from the literary stage of religious and folk fairs like Dadri is seen as a departure point for modern Indian social, political and economic thought
 bhaashan kaa ek chota sa ansh dekhie- This essay is a unique example of how clarity of ideas and how it can be presented with humor
 dekhie, kis tarah bharat kii chintaa is nibandh main bhaaratendu vyakt karte hai, In fact, his article is a kind of ideological extension of his play called Bharat Plight
 bharat durdasha main ve kehete hai, Bhartendu had understood well that 'english rule is for the benefit of Indians' This was a completely hollow claim and was propaganda
 angrej kis tarah bharat kii sampada lut rahe the, iskaa sanket bharatendu ne 'kavivachansudha' ke 7 march, 1874 ke ank main apni tippanee main diya, Bharatendu was such a great advocate of the equality of men and women that in the November 3, 1873 issue of 'kavikavasudha', he wrote, galtundika maanav ke gale ke pichley hisse main sthit ek ang he
 It is a type of tissue that acts as the first line of defense against invasion from external microbes
 galaa hamaare sharir kaa ek mahatvapurn ang he
 Its importance is clear from this point that it is the responsibility of the food and air entering the body
 isi mahatvapurn kaary ko nibhaane ke kaaran yahi hissaa hamaare dwaara grahan kiye jane vaale bhojan, jal tathaa vaayu main upasthit kisi bhi jahrile tatv se sabase pehle prabhavit hota he
 The nose and ears are also not untouched by this
 haalanki bahari rup se dekhne se hamaare naak, galaa va kaan alag−alag dikhaai dete hai parantu gale ke bheetar jaakar in teenon angon kii koshikaayen aapas main mil jaati hai
 For this reason, if any type of infection occurs in any one of these three organs, then it affects all three organs
 is kaaran jaruri he ki koi bhi sankraman hote hi jaldi se uskaa upachaar kiya jaae
 In order to protect these organs from infection of any poisonous element present in the external environment, nature has designed the mouth and throat in such a way that those toxic elements have no effect on the internal system of our mouth
 bahari rup main dekhne par naak va mukh ek sampoorn ang ke rup main hi dikhaai dete hai, unke alag−alag hisse dikhaai nahin dete
 But in fact these organs are divided into many parts
 haalanki nitalacavity marottege or netleceptor dekhne main to alag−alag dikhaai dete hai parantu peeche jaakar gale kii andar aapas main ek cavity main mil jate hai jise 'oropheringells' kehete hai
 The posterior part of the nose above the oropharyngeals is called the 'lezoferringles'
 tonsil kii samasya kaa kaaran kisi bhi prakaar kaa sankraman yaa infections ho saktaa he jo hamaare sharir main mukh va naak se pravesh kar rahaa ho
 These pollution or infection can cause immediate problems when air contaminated with any type of viral or bacterial pollutants enters the body through the breath
 aise sthaan jahaan ke vaataavaran main badboo, sillen tathaa anya kisi rasinic tatv kaa samavesh ho aise sthanon main vaayu ke dwaara nirantar jahrile tatwon ke sampark main aane ke kaaran tonsil rog kii samasya khadi ho sakati he
 More cases of this disease are seen in children because their immunity is less
 aisa nahin ki badi umr ke log isse grasit nahin ho sakate unamem bhi yah samasya dekhi ja sakati he
 Tonsillitis is a dangerous condition of the disease because the body reacts due to antibodies
 is avasthaa main jaise hi antigen hamaare sharir main pravesh karata he vaise hi tonsil tishyu usase ladanaa shuru kar dete hai isse jo antigen banataa he vah sharir ke anya bhaagon main upasthit protein ke saath pratikriya karke vahaan bhi isi prakaar ke antibadis bana detaa he
 These antibodies have a direct effect on the heart valves and pose a risk of heart valve deterioration
 tonsil to zyaadaatar bacchon ko hota he parantu iskaa dil par padane vaala dushprabhav kisi bhi umr main pad saktaa he
 Inadequate treatment of throat infections in childhood is also a cause of heart diseases in our country
 iske atirikt tonsil se bairaphengills epashish, neutrapheringles epashish jaisi bimaariyaan bhi ho sakati hai
 This problem arising due to disturbances in the mechanical structure of the body due to toxic elements can be identified by looking at some initial symptoms like- Frequent sore throat, sore throat, pain, recurrent fever etc
 yadi aise hi lakshan rogi ko baar−baar ho rahe hon
 For example, five or six times a year, he should have a tonsil operation done
 lager aaparishan main do se teen ghante kaa samay lagata he or bilkul cheer−faad nahin hoti
 To avoid tonsils, it is important that children are given a balanced diet so that their body's immunity is strong
 sabase jaruri to yah he ki tonsil ke lakshan dikhte hi turant doctor se sampark karen
 The course of medicine given by the doctor should be completed
 aksar log thodaa sa aaraam milte hi dawaai band kar dete hai parantu aisa karnaa rog ko or adhik ugr bana detaa he
 During this disease, the patient has difficulty in swallowing food and water
 aise main bahut se log kam khate hai, yah thik nahin he
 Continue to serve soft or liquid foods to meet the needs of the patient's body
 isse sharir kii rog pratirohak kshamta bani rahati he
 According to Hinduism, Pradosha fast is extremely auspicious in the Kali Yuga and Shiva provides blessings
 maah kii trayodashi tithi main saayam kaal ko pradosh kaal kaha jaataa he
 It is believed that Mahadev dances in the Rajat Bhawan of Mount Kailash at the time of Pradosh and the deity praises his qualities
 jo bhi log apana kalyaan chaahate hon yah vrath rakh sakate hai
 By observing the Pradosh fast, every type of defect is erased
 saptaah kesaaton din ke pradosh vrath kaa apana vishesh mahatv he
 Pradosh has been about the fast that if is vrath ke mahatmaya ko ganga ke tat par kisi samay vedon ke gyaata or bhagwaan kebhakt sutaji ne shaunkadi rishiyon ko sunaaya tha
 Sutji has said that in the Kali Yuga when man is going away from the conduct of religion and going on the path of unrighteousness, there will be injustice and misconduct on the side
 maanav apane kartavya se vimukh hokar neech karm main sanlagn hoga us samay pradosh vrath aisa vrath hoga jo maanav ko shiv kii krupa kaa paatr banayega or neech gati se mukt hokar manushya uttam lokko praapt hoga
 Sut Ji also told the Shaunkadi sages that by virtue of Pradosh, all kinds of sufferings and sins of man will be destroyed in Kali Yuga by virtue
 yah vrath ati kalyankari he is vrath ke prabhaav se manushyako abhisht kii prapti hogi
 What is the benefit of Pradosh fasting on different days in this fast? soot ji ne shaunkadi rishiyon kobataya ki is vrath ke mahatmay ko sarvapratham bhagwaan shankar ne mata sati kosunaya tha
 Maharishi Ved Vyas ji told me the same story and greatness and i have told you this great fast Mahatmya
 pradosh vrath vidhansoot ji ne kaha he prayek paksh kii trayodashi ke vrath ko pradosh vrath kehete hai
 The time before nightfall after sunset is called Pradosh Kaal
 is vrath main mahadev bhole shankaraki puja kii jaati he
 In this fast, the fast is kept waterless
 praat: kaal snaan karke bhagwaan shiv kii bel patr, gangaajal akshat dhoop deep sahit puja karen
 One should worship Shiva in this way after bathing again in the evening
 is prakaar pradosh vrath karne se vrati ko punya miltaa he
 Brick work or 'brick masonry' means to mark bricks in such a way that the wall made of them is strengthened
 iton kii jodai yaa chinai main iton ke bich gaare, chooney or baaluu, chooney or surkhi, chai or chooney athwa cement or baaluu kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 But the firmness of the walls is not dependent only on mortar etc
 iten is prakaar rakhi jaati hai ki ve ek duusare ke sahare tiki rahati hai, parantu aavashyaktaa padane par diwaar ko bina vishrinkhalit kiye hi usamen se do chaar iten khinchakar baahar nikaal bhi lee ja sakati hai
 Glossary: the brick placed along the wall is called the belt towards Varanasi and the brick placed transversely is broken or small; Each of the two half-bricks cut along the length of the brick is called a khanda; Breaking along the width, each of the two half-bricks is called aadha
 khande ke aadhe ko roda kehete hai
 Many types of chawls are used in brick work
 unamem se mukhya reetiyaan neeche bataai gai hai- Ingshill mode - In this manner, from the outside, every lease shows either only lease or only broken
 patte or todevaale radde ek ke upar ek aate rahete hai
 Dual Flemish way - In every waste, the leash and break keep coming back one after the other
 diwaar ke donon ore aisa hi dikhaai padataa he
 Single Flemish manner - When seen from outside the house, the lease and break in each trash keep coming back one after another, but when viewed from inside, the wall seems to be connected to the English way
 keval patte - kuch bheetein prayek radde main keval patte rakhkar banaai jaati hai
 Such a wall is half a brick thick
 keval tode - prayek radde main keval tode hi lagaae ja sakate hai; mehrabadar judai, diwaar kaa paad, chazza, carnis aadi banane ke kaam main aisi judai kii jaati he
 Garden or front wall - In such walls, there is a break next to the three strips
 flemish jodai kii apeksha english jodai adhik majboot hoti he, parantu flemish jodai se adhik sapaat diwaar banati he
 For example, if a wall is 9 inches long and a 9 inch thick wall is to be built, the thickness of the wall can be reduced to exactly 9 inches by placing a modular slur between the two strips, but the actual length of the bricks remains modular
 ab 9 inch kii diwaar jodne par jahaan patte rahenge vahaan iton kii chhotai badai ke anusaar diwaar bheetar ghus jaaegi yaa baahar nikal padegi
 In Flemish plowing, the leases are longer and less broken
 isi se flemish jodai adhik sapaat hoti he
 For the boundary wall of the frontage, the same reason is kept of three junk leases and then only one rubble break
 isse diwaar avashya kuch kamjor banati he, parantu aisi diwaar par adhik boj nahin rahata ki vishesh majbootee kii aavashyaktaa pade
 Even if you want to plaster the wall, the wall should be as flat as possible, otherwise more spice is spent
 eent ke kaam main suvyavasthit ekarupata keval eent kii naas kor thik hone par hi nahin nirbhar rahati, balki jod kii naap par bhi nirbhar hoti he, kyonki yadi prayek radde ke bich ke masaale kii unchaai aapas main thik mail nahin khaaegi to iten sachhee rahakar hi kya karengi? eent ke kaam main jod kii motaai niyantrit rakhane ke liye chaar radde kii motaai pehle se nirdhaarit kar di jaati he
 For example, if the height of the brick is 23⁄4 inches and the height of the mortar joint is to be a quarter inch, then it can be made that the height of each four cancellations in the work of plowing should be exactly 12 inches

 Therefore, he was opposed to conservatives and democracy alike

 Although Patriots like Matsini and Garibaldi supported him in this task, only Kavur's efficiency and diplomacy could solve this complex problem
 1848 kii kranti ke samay pidmant main rashtriya mahasabha kaa sanghathan hua
 Kavoor was elected its member
 usne 1848 ke shashanvidhan ke nirmaan main apni kshamta kaa parichay diya
 In 1850 AD, Kavoor was appointed Business Minister of Piedmant and two years later he became Prime Minister and soon after becoming Kavur realized that the salvation of Italy could not be achieved only on the strength of Pidmant
 is kaary ke liye sampurna italvi rajyon kaa sahyog tathaa videshi sahaayta kii bhi paramaavashyaktaa hogi
 To accomplish this purpose, he resorted to diplomacy
 england tathaa france ke saath kreemia ke yuddh main bhaag lekar usne in prabal rajyon ko austria ke viruddh karne kaa safal praytn kiya
 Kavur joined the Treaty of Paris at the end of the Crimean War

 But it was impossible to solve the problem of Italy peacefully at this time
 1815 kii vienna kii sandhi ko bhang kiye bina austria ko italy se nahin hataaya ja saktaa tha
 But Europe, fearing the revolution of 1848 AD, did not have the courage to amend the Treaty of Vienna of 1815
 aisa karne se unhen krantikari andolanon ke punarutthan kaa bhay tha
 Hence, the second chapter of Kavur's efforts to free Italy began
 kavur austria ke viruddh yuddh ko anivaary samajhataa tha
 With the support of France, he planned to defeat Austria with military might
 france ke samrat nepolian tritiy tathaa kavur ke bich hue samjhaute ke anusaar france ne italy kii sainik sahaayta karne kaa vachan diya
 At the end of Austria's rule from northern Italy, it was also decided to give the territories of Nice and Savoy, which were situated between France and Italy, to France
 italy ke rajyon main kavur ne krantikari dalon ko protsaahan dena prarambh kiya
 He got support from all the revolutionary organizations like 'carbonari' and 'youth Italy'
 kavur kaa protsaahan paakar lombardi tathaa vinishia ke krantikariyon ne austrian shashan kaa virodh karnaa prarambh kar diya
 In addition, the military power organization was also started in Piedmantha by following constant pressure
 austria ke shaasha in virodhon se ghabara gaye or kavur ko yah aadesh diya ki nai bhartee sena ko tod diya jaae
 But Kavoor was waiting for this opportunity
 atev 18 april 1859 kii austria kii ore se yudhghoshnaa kar di gai
 Kavoor had every hope of succeeding his cause
 parantu nepolian tritiy ne is samay apni niti badal di
 The emergence of a powerful nation near his kingdom did not make him desirable for France
 iske atirikt france kaa samrat pope ke viruddh bhi koi aisa kaary nahin karnaa chahta tha jisase swadesh ke catholic uske viruddh ho jaaen
 Kavoor alone wanted to wage war
 parantu pidmant ke raja viktar emanuele dwitiya se is vishay main matbhed ho jane se usne apana tyaagptr de diya
 But as a result of this war waged by Kavur, the Lombardy, Parma, Modena, and Tuscany territories came under the authority of Piedmanton, according to the treaty in Zurich on 10 November 1859

 Therefore, it was necessary for Napoleon to establish a well-organized governance and law and order in the interior
 pratham counsal banane ke baad nepolian ne france ke liye ek naveen samvidhan kaa nirmaan kiya jo kranti yug kaa chauthaa samvidhan tha
 Through this, executive power was vested in three counselors
 pradhan counsal ko anya counsalaron se adhik shakti praapt thi
 In fact, the Republic certainly showed in the Constitution, but the entire power of the state was concentrated in the hands of Nepalis
 nepolian ne shashan vyavastha kaa kenndrikaran kiya or departments tathaa district kii sthaneey sarkaron ko samaapt kar prefect evam sab-prefects kii niyukti kii

 Encouraged construction work to overcome the problem of unemployment
 is tarah nepolian ne france ko jarjar or diwaaliyepan kii sthit se ubaara
 But even in terms of economic reforms, Napoleon's actions appear to be anti-revolution
 krantikaal main pratyaksh karo par bal diya gaya tha jabaki nepolian ne apratyaksh karon par bal dekar puraatan vyavastha ko sthapit karne kii koshish kii
 In the same way, Napoleon displayed an anti-revolutionary mindset by prioritizing the commercialist philosophy

 Its aim was to keep maximum government control over education and to make students loyal to the government
 nepolian ne shodh kaaryon ke liye insticute of france kii sthapana kii
 Napoleon showed no interest in women's education

 The majority of France's population was under the influence of the Catholic Church
 kranti ke dauraan carch kii shakti ko kamjor kar use rajya ke adheen le aayaa gaya
 Church property was nationalized and clergy were asked to take an oath of loyalty to the state
 isse pope naaraaz hua or aam janata ko virodh karne ke liye uksaaya
 As a result, there was tension between the government and the public
 nepolian ne ise dur karne ke liye 1801 se pope ke saath samjhauta kiya jise konkardet kaha jaataa he
 He had the following provisions
 nepolian kaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn or sthaayee kaary tha- vidhi samhita kaa nirmaan
 In fact, before the revolution, the law and order of France was different and there were so many types of laws that even those who followed the law did not know them and this chaos increased even during the revolution
 nepolian ne is avyavashtha ko dur kiya
 Napoleon himself considered his Code of Law more powerful than his 40 wars

 Under the Civil Code, he strengthened the authority of the head of the family
 striyaan purushon ke adheen rakhi gai or pati kaa kaary patni kii raksha karnaa he
 The divorce method was made difficult

 Thus, by recognizing the practice of civil marriage and divorce, Napoleon practiced in Europe that the work of society could go on without the cooperation of the priests
 is prakaar anya samhitaayein jaise vyapaar sambandhi kanoon samhita, Code of Criminal Proc
 aadi banaae gaye
 The interests of the laborers were ignored in its trading code and the ban on their unions continued
 is drushti se nepolian ne kranti ke aadarshon ke viruddh kaary kiya
 Despite this, the importance of this law code was to provide uniformity of law throughout the country and to simplify the judicial system practically
 jahaan-jahaan nepolian kii senaayen gai yah samhita lagu kii gai or nepolian ke paraajay ke baad bhi barkaraar rahi
 It is a permanent fame of Napoleon
 nepolian ke vidhi samhita main burjua varg ke hiton par zyada jor diya gaya he
 The officer related to land was further strengthened and the protection of personal property was further strengthened and a number of laws were enacted to protect personal property
 tered union bananaa aparaadh ghoshit kiya gaya

 Napoleon established a new elite in society
 usne aay ke hisaab se oopaadhiyon kaa kram nirdhaarit kiya
 This work of Napoleon was contrary to the ideals of revolution
 europe raajnneetik kshitij par nepolian kaa pradurbhaav ek ghumaketu kii tarah hua or apni prakriya tathaa parishram ke bal par vah sheeghra hi europe kaa bhaagyavidhaataa ban baitha
 In it, everyone was amazed by his amazing military and administrative abilities
 parantu uski shakti kaa stambh jaise baalu kii bhit par khadaa tha
 What collapsed within a few years was virtually the rise and fall of Napoleon like a dazzling meteor
 vah europe ke akaash main sainik safalataa ke bal par chamakta rahaa parantu paraajay ke saath hi uske bhagya kaa sitara dub gaya
 The empire, which was established after hard work, came to an end on seeing that there were many reasons for its downfall, which are the same
 aseem mahatvakanksha- Napoleon was infinitely ambitious
 aseem mahatvakankshi kisi vyakti ke patan kaa mukhya kaaran sabit hoti he
 The same thing happened with Napoleon
 yuddh main jaise- jaise- uski vijay hoti gai vaise- vaise uski mahatvakanksha badhaata gaya or vah vishwa rajya kii sthapana kaa swapan dekhne laga
 He would not have to see the plight of the downfall if he was satisfied with a little and took care of the conquered empire and spent his time in it
 charitrik durbalata- Napoleon was full of courage, restraint and patience, but in his eyes, hatred was his vengeance and his stigma of forgiveness
 uske charitra kii badi durbalata yah thi ki vah sandhi ko sammanit samjhauta nahin maanata tha
 Friendship of any country was no more than a political necessity for him
 dhire- dhire vah ziddee banataa gaya use yah vishwaas tha ki uskaa prayek kadam thik he
 He could never forget, he began to ignore the advice of others
 falat: uske sachche mitra bhi usase dur hote chale gaye
 Napoleon's system was based on militarism- uski raajnneetik pranali sanyavad par aadhaarit thi jo iske patan kaa pradhan kaaran sabit hua
 He depended on the army in all matters, as a result he was always involved in war
 vah yah bhul gaya ki sainikwaad sirf sankat ke samay hi laabhakaari ho saktaa he
 As long as France was clouded by plagues, the people there supported him
 As soon as the plagues were removed, the people stopped supporting him
 francisi janata kii sahanubhuti or prem kaa khona uske liye ghaatak siddh hua
 Apart from this, the defeated nations became his enemies, who rose up against him as soon as the opportunity arose
 itihaaskaar kabbon ne thik hi likhaa he
 'napoleon's empire flourished in war The war was the basis of his existence and it ended in war itself
 ’ Defective military system prarambh main france kii sena desh prem kii bhaavana se otprot thi
 He used to fight for an ideal and to serve a purpose
 parantu jyon- jyon uske samrajya kaa vistaar hua sena kaa rashtriya rup vidhitat hota gaya
 At first, French troops were included in his army but later German German Purtagali and Dutch soldiers were added to it
 falat: uski sena anek rajyon kii sena ban gai
 There was no ideal and purpose before him
 at: uski sainik shakti kamjor padati gai or yah uske patan kaa mahatvapurn kaaran sabit hua
 Weakness of the Navy nepolian ne sthal sena kaa sanghathan thik se kiya tha kintu uske paas shaktishali nausena kaa abhaav tha, jiske kaaran use england se parajeet hona padaa
 If he had a powerful navy he would not have to be defeated by England
 vijit pradeshon main deshbhakti kaa abhaav- The territories he conquered were not in the hearts of the people, but he had goodwill and love for them
 ve nepolian kii shashan se ghrinaa karte the
 When his power began to weaken, his subordinate states began to strive for their independence
 europea raashtra ne uske khilaaf sangh ke liye chaturth gut kaa nirmaan kiya or isi ke chalate waterlu ke yuddh main use parajeet hona padaa
 Enmity with the pope mahadwipiya vyavastha ke kaaran usne pope ko apana shatru bana liya

 or 1809 i
 main pope ko bandi bana liya falat: catholicon ko yah vishwaas ho gaya ki nepolian ne keval rajyon kii swatantraaa nasht karne vaala daanav he
 Otherwise, they also destroy their religion
 audyogic kranti- It is said that he was defeated not in the grounds of Waterloo but in the factories of Manchester and the iron cladding of Barkingdhan
 audyogic kranti ke falswarup england main bade -2 kaarkaane khole gaye or dekhte hi dekhte england samrudh ban gaya
 As a result, he was able to meet his army's modern assassin, which proved fatal to Napoleon
 mahadwipiya vyavastha- The continental system was quite forgotten
 vah england ko sabase bada shatru maanata tha
 England's mainstay of power was naval and worldwide trade and Napoleon could not destroy his naval power, so his trade was tried to strike
 isi uddeshy se usne mahadwipiya vyavastha ko janm diya usne aadesh jari kiya ki koi desh england ke saath vyapaar nahin kar saktaa he
 And neither can use England made
 yah nepolian kii bhayankar bhul thi
 This arrangement trapped him in a trap that was difficult to get out of
 isliye mahadwipiya vyavastha iske patan kaa mukhya kaaran mana jaataa he
 War with the Portuguese purtegal kaa england ke saath vyapaarik sambandh tha kintu nepolian ke dawaab ke kaaran use england se sambandh todna padaa
 This caused considerable damage to Purtigal
 isliye usne phir se england ke saath vyapaarik sambandh kaayam kiya
 Napoleon was enraged and attacked Purtagal
 yah bhi nepolian ke liye ghaatak siddh hua
 Conflict with Spain nepolian kii teesri bhul spain ke aantarik maamle main hastkshep tha
 Millions of its soldiers were killed
 falat: is yuddh main uski sthiti bilkul kamjor ho gai
 Which encouraged his opponents, when Napoleon made his brother king of Spain, the inhabitants there were not ready to consider that foreigner as king
 unhone nepolian kii sena ko spain se bhaga diya
 Other countries were also encouraged by that rebellion and they also started revolting, which made its fall inevitable
 rus kaa abhiyaan- Napoleon heavily invaded Russia and Russia did not accept its continental system
 isapar nepolian ne rus par akraman kar diya
 In this, however, Moscow was captured but it had to suffer great damage
 uske virodhiyon ne akraman karne kii yojana banaai
 He had to be defeated in this attack
 thakaan- He was tired of being constantly busy in many wars
 50 tourists have written that all the reason for the fall of Napoleon lies in the same word fatigue
 jyon- jyon vah yudadh main ulajhata gaya tyon- 2 uski shakti kamjor padati gai vah thak gaya or uske chalate bhi uskaa patan jaruri ho gaya
 Relative uske patan ke liye uske sage sambadhi bhi kam uttaradaayi nahin the
 However, he used to behave generously towards his relatives
 lekin jab bhi vah sankat main padataa tha to uske sambandhi uski madad nahin karte the
 Organization of quartz nepolian kii kamajori se laabh uthaakar uske shatruon ne chaturth gut kaa nirmaan kiya or mitra rashtron ne use parajeet kiya
 He was captured and sent to Salbai and was made independent ruler there but Napoleon could not stay there for a long time
 He soon returned to France and became the ruler there
 lekin isbaar vah sirf sau dinon tak ke liye samraat rahe
 The Allies were finally defeated in the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815 AD
 vah pakad liya gaya mitra rashtron ne use kaidi ke rup main saint helena naamak tapu par bhej diya jahaan 52 varshon kii aayu main 1821 i
 main uski mrityu ho gai
 Thus, all the above reasons were directly and indirectly responsible for his downfall
 He built his empire through war and it also fell due to the wars

 Ethics, also known as Behaviorism, Ethics, Ethics and Ethics, is a branch of philosophy
 yadhyapi achaarshastra kii paribhaasha tathaa kshetra prayek yug main matbhed ke vishay rahe hai, phir bhi vyapak rup se yah kaha ja saktaa he ki achaarshastra main un saamaanya siddhanton kaa vivechan hota he jinke aadhaar par maanviya kriyaaon or uddeshyon kaa muulyankan sambhav ho sake
 Most authors and thinkers also agree that ethics is primarily concerned with norms and values, not the study or discovery of objects and these criteria should be used not only in the analysis of personal life but in the analysis of social life
 i also
 acha or bura, sahi or galat, gun or dosha, nyaay or jurm jaisi avadharanaon ko paribhaashit karke, nitishastra maanviya naitikta ke prashnon ko sulajhane kaa prayaas karata hai
 As a field of intellectual review, he also deals with the areas of moral philosophy, descriptive ethics, and value theory
 nitishastra main abhyaas ke teen pramukh kshetra jinhen manyata praapt hai: In this, the party works according to whatever advice is given to the lawyer and his party
 rashaworth keader kehete hai ki ""nitishastra" kii maanak paribhaashaon main 'adarsh maanav charitra kaa vigyaan' yaa 'naitik kartavya kaa vigyaan' jaise vaakyansh aam taur par shaamil rahe hai
 "ethics are a set of concepts and principles that, as Richard William Paul and Linda Elder define, guide us in determining what behavioral sensitivities help or cause harm"
 cambridge dictionari of philocyphi yah kahati hai ki nitishastra shabd kaa "upyog saamanytah vinemian rup se 'naitikta' ke saath hota hai' or kabhi-kabhi kisi vishesh parampara, samooh yaa vyakti ke naitik siddhanton ke arth hetu iskaa adhik sankeern upyog hota hai"
 Paul and Elder say that most people get confused between social practices, religious beliefs, and behavior, and ethics, and do not consider ethics alone as a concept
 "nitishastra" shabd ke kai arth hote hai
 This can refer to philosophical ethics or moral philosophy
 manushya ke vyavhaar kaa adhyayan anek shastron main anek drushtiyon se kiya jaataa he
 Human behavior, like nature's trades, occurs in the form of a work-cause-chain and can be studied and interpreted causally
 manovigyaan yahi karata he
 But we do not characterize natural trades as good or bad
 raste main achaanak varsha aa jane se bhigane par ham badalon ko kuvachy nahin kehane lagate
 On the contrary, on the actions of fellow human beings, we pass judgment of good and bad
 is prakaar nirnay dene kii saarvbhaum maanviya pravriti hi achaardarshan kii janani he
 In ethics, we think systematically and try to know what is the wise basis of our good and evil decisions
 kaha jaataa he, achaarshastra niamak athwa aadarshanveshi vigyaan he, jabaki manovigyaan yatharthanveshi shaastra he
 Certainly there is some fact in this classification of scriptures, but it can also be misleading
 ukt vargeekaran yah dharna utpann kar saktaa he ki achaardarshan kaa kaam naitik vyavhaar ke niyamon kaa anveshan tathaa udghaatan nahin he, apitu kritrim dhang se vaise niyamon ko maanav samaaj par lad dena he
 But this assumption is wrong
 nitishastra jin naitik niyamon kii khoj karata he ve swayan manushya kii mul chetana main nihit hai
 Of course, this consciousness is seen taking different forms in different societies and ages
 is anekarupata kaa pradhan kaaran maanav prakruti kii jatilta tathaa maanviya shrey kii vividhrupatha he
 The thinkers of different countries explore the moral standards inherent in the prevailing laws of their societies
 hamaare apane yug main hi, anek nai puraani samskritiyon ke sammilan ke kaaran, vichaarkon ke liye yah sambhav ho saktaa he ki ve anginat roodhiyon tathaa saapekshya manyataon se upar uthakar vastut: saarvbhaum naitik siddhanton ke udghaatan kii ore agrasar hon
 Meta-ethics asks how we understand this, how we know about it and what it means when we talk of 'what is right' and 'what is wrong'
 yah man main chal rahi ulajhanon kaa ek sakaaratmak nichod he
 Critical ethics is the study of ethics
 yah nitishastra kii vah shakha hai, jo un prashnon ke sammuchay kii jaanch karti hai, jinka udgam yah sochate vaqt hota hai ki naitik rup se kisi ko kaise kaam karnaa chaiye
 Critical ethics differs from meta-ethics in that it examines the parameters of what works are right or wrong, while meta-ethics studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts
 mandandak nitishastra varnatmak nitishastra se bhi bhinn hai, kyonki pashchaatkathit logon kii naitik aasthaaon kii anubhavsiddh jaanch hai
 In other words, descriptive ethics is concerned with determining what proportion of people believe that murder is always wrong, while normative ethics is concerned with whether it is wrong to hold it
 atah, kabhi-kabhi mandandak nitishastra ko varnatmak ke bajaay nirdeshaatmak kaha jaataa hai
 However, in some versions of the meta-ethnographic view, called moral realism, moral facts are both descriptive and normative at the same time
 paramparaagat, mandandak nitishastra is baat kaa adhyayan tha ki vah kya hai jo kisi kriya ko kya sahi yaa galat banaata hai
 These principles provide broad moral principles to address difficult ethical decisions
 maanav kaa sadaiv se ek pramukh drushtikon upyogetavaad rahaa he
 This ideology reflects that aspect of human behavior, which states that ==naitik darshan== manav jeevan me naitik sidhanton ko hi naitik darshan kehte hain Political ethics is the practice of making ethical ethical decisions about political action and political agents
 varnatmak nitishastra varnapat ke darshanik chor kii ore kam jhukta he kyonki uskaa uddeshy hai kaise log jite hai is bare main khaas jaankaree praapt karnaa or drusht pratimaanon ke aadhaar par saamaanya nishkarsh nikaalnaa
 In relation to what is the basic question of ethics, two important opinions are found
 ek mantavya ke anusaar nitishastra kii pradhan samasya yah batalaana he ki maanav jivan kaa param shrey kya he
 On realizing the ultimate credit, we will say auspicious actions to those who are going to take that credit; Opposite actions will be called inauspicious
 duusare mantavya ke anusaar nitishastra kaa pradhan kaary shubh yaa dharmasammat kii dharna ko spasht karnaa he
 In other words, the function of ethics is to clarify the form of a rule or rule according to which rituals are performed as auspicious or religious
 e do mantavya do bhinn kotiyon kii vichaarpaddatiyon ko janm dete hai
 The ultimate credit has been conceived in many ways; We will describe these fantasies or theories further
 yahan ham sankshep main yah vimarsh karenge ki naitikta ke niyam-yadi vaise koi niyam hote hai to-kis koti ke ho sakate hai
 The notion of a rule or law comes either from the penal law of the state or from the physical sciences, where the laws of nature are cited
 rajya ke kanoon ek prakaar ke shaskaon kii newnaadhik niyantrit ichha dwaara nirmit hote hai
 They are sometimes made for the benefit of some classes, they can be broken and some people may be harmed by their adherence
 iske vipareet prakruti ke niyam akhandaneey hote hai
 State laws are subject to change, but laws of nature are immutable
 niti yaa sadachaar ke niyam aparivartaneey, paalankarta ke liye kalyankar evam akhandaneey samajhe jate hai
 In these respects the rules of ethics are completely similar to the laws of health science
 aisa jaan padataa he ki manushya athwa maanav prakruti do bhinn kotiyon ke niyamon ke niyantran main vyaprut hoti he
 On the one hand, human beings are subject to laws which are inaugurated or represented in the physical sciences, chemistry, science, psychology, psychology etc
 and on the other hand the rules of ideal sciences, such as health science, logic, etc
, which they are not bound by, but which are followed It is necessary for its happiness and progress
 nitishastra ke niyam is duusari koti ke hote hai
 Following are the major problems of ethics- nitishastra kii samasyaon ko ham teen virgon main baant sakate hai : Many imaginations have been made in the East and West about the ultimate credit
 bharat main praaia: sabhi darshan yah maanate hai ki jivan kaa charam lakshya sukh he, kintu unamem se adhikansh kii sukh sambandhi dharna tathakthith saukhyavaad se nitant bhinn he
 In this second or prevailing sense, we can only call the Charvak philosophy a Soukhvadi
 charvak ke naitik mantavyon kaa koi vyavasthit varnan uplabdh nahin he, kintu yah samajha jaataa he ki uske saukhyavaad main sthool andriya sukh ko hi mahatv diya gaya he
 Other philosophies of India, the ultimate happiness which is called the goal of life, have been equated with class, liberation or salvation or nirvana
 nyaay tathaa sankhya darshanon main apvarg yaa mukti kii kalpana kii gai he, use bhavatmak sukhrup nahin kaha ja saktaa kintu upanishdon tathaa vedant kii muktavastha aanandarup kahi ja sakati he
 Both the liberation of Vedanta and the nirvana of Buddhists are indicative of the situation when the soul of a person goes beyond the duality of happiness, sorrow etc
 yah sthiti jeevankaal main bhi aa sakati he; bhagavadgita main sthitprajna kaha gaya he vah ek prakaar se jivanmukt hi kaha ja saktaa he
 In Western philosophies, many opinions regarding the ultimate credit are found: hamaare param shrey athwa shubh-ashubh ke gyaan kaa saadhan yaa strot kya he, is sambandh main bhi vibhinn matvaad hai
 In the opinion of most suffragists, the perception of good and evil is through wisdom
 hegel, breadle aadi kaa mat yahi he or kaant kaa mantavya bhi iskaa virdohi nahin he
 Kant believes that ultimately our sense of action is the source of moral ideals
 anubhavvaadiyon ke anusaar hamaare shubh ashubh ke gyaan kaa strot anubhav hi he
 This view gives rise to moral ambiguity
 teesraa mat pratibhaanvaad athwa apyajhhvjj ) he
 According to this view, there is such a power within us that we know or know the auspicious inauspicious way
 pratibhaanvaad ke anek rup hai
 The British philosophers named Shaftesbury and Hutcheson thought that just like the senses accepting Roopa Rasa etc
, we also have a moral sense in us that directly sees good and evil
 bishap butler naam ke vichaarak ke mat main hamaare andar sadasadbuddhi naam kii ek prerak vritti hoti he jo swaarth tathaa pararth ke bich uthanevaale dwandv kaa samaadhaan karti hui hamen auchity kaa maarg dikhalaataa he
 There are many motivational circles of our conduct; One instinct is self-love, the other is self-interest
 sadasadbuddhi kaa sthaan in donon se upar he, vah in donon ke upar nirnaayak rup main pratishthit he
 The German thinker Kant is also counted among the pratibhists
 pratibhanvaadee naitik siddhanton kaa ek saamaanya lakshan yah he ki ve kisi kaary kii bhalaai buraai ke nirnay ke liye uske parinaamon par dhyaan dena aavashyak nahin samajhate
 No karma becomes auspicious or inauspicious because its results are of one or the other category
 yaa kisi kaary ke samast parinaamon kii purvakalpana waisi hi kathin he jaisaa ki unpar niyantran kar sakna
 The good and evil of karma are determined by its motivation
 jis karm ke mul main shubh prerana he vah sat karm he, ashubh prerana main janm lenevaala karm asat karm yaa paap he
 Thorn's statement that auspicious resolution is a thing that is self-respecting, whose credibility is absolute and definite; The credit of all remaining items is relative
 keval shubh sankalpaikti hi apni shreyrup jyoti se prakashit hoti he
 Indian thinkers have also expressed many opinions regarding what is the source of knowledge of moral auspicious and inauspicious
 mimasaa darshan ke anusaar shruti dwaara prerit aachaar hi dharm he or shruti yaa veda dwaara nishiddh karm adharm
 Thus religion and unrighteousness are law-abiding
 bhagavadgita main nishkaam karmyog kii shiksha ke saath-saath yah batalaaya gaya he ki kartavya-kartavya kii jaankaree ke liye shaastra hi pramaan he
 Under the scripture, both Shruti and Smriti are calculated
 hindu dharm ke prayek varna tathaa ashram ke liye alag-alag kartavyon kaa nirdesh kiya gaya he; in kartavyon kaa vishad vivechan dharmasutron tathaa smritigranthon main miltaa he
 In addition to the duties of this category, it has also been considered as proof for the understanding of general religion or universal religions
 sajjanon ke aachaar ko pathpradarshak rup main sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The basis of the imperative of moral conduct has also been conceived in many ways
 manushya ke itihaas main naitikta kaa sabase mahatvapurn niamak dharm rahaa he
 We should follow moral rules, because that is what favors God or theology
 sadachaar kii duusari niamak shakti rajya he
 Kingship is an important factor in preventing people from immoral acts
 isi prakaar samaaj kaa bhay bhi naitik niyamon ko shakti detaa he
 According to thorn, we should do religion for ourselves; Duty of duty is itself a favored or practicable object
 jo vichaarak kartavya-kartavya ko paramashrey kii apeksha se rakshit karte hai, ve kah sakate hai ki naitik achaaran kii prerana mulat: atmonnati kii prerana he
 We do auspicious actions, because by doing that we progress towards our ultimate credit
 nitishastra kii ek mahatvapurn samasya yah he ki kya manushya karm ke liye swatantra he? jab ham ek vyakti ko uske kisi kaary ke liye bhala bura kehete hai, tab spasht hi use us kaary ke liye uttaradaayi maan lete hai, jiskaa matlab hota he yah prachhann vishwaas he ki vah vyakti vichaaradhin kaary karne na karne ke liye swatantra tha
 The thorn says: Since i must, i can
 taatpary yah ki karta kii swatantraaa ko maane bina naitik jivan evam naitik moolyankan kii vyavastha sambhav nahin dikhti
 We do not call the trades of nature as bad, but only give such judgment on the deeds of man; This shows that there is some difference between natural and human businesses
 yah antar manushya kii swatantraaa ke kaaran he
 a person's determination to make the ritual of an action not a matter of desire is free
 nirdharanwad ke poshakon ko ukt mat grahya nahin he
 Physics states that there is unbroken rule of work-cause-rule everywhere in the universe
 prayek vartmaan ghatana kaa nirdhaaran ateet hetuon se hota he
 The whole world is a large work-cause-tradition
 sab prakaar kii ghatnaayen akhand niyamon ke adheen hai
 In such a situation, how can it be believed that human beings are free of choice and business without reason and ruleless? The activities of human beings cannot be considered exceptional in the phenomenology of the world
 yadi anek avasaron par ham maanviya vyapaaron ke sambandh main safal bhavishyavaanee nahin kar sakate to iskaa kaaran hamaari un vyapaaron ke niamak niyamon kii apurna jaankaree he, na ki un vyapaaron kii niyamaheenata
 The theory of determinism is bolstered by the physical scriptures; He also derives support from the mechanistic interpretation of nature
 kintu iskaa yah matlab nahin ki nirdharanwad ek bhautik siddhant he
 It is said that there is no place for the freedom of the individual in the philosophies of Spinoza and Hegel
 sankhya darshan main purush ko nirgun tathaa niskriy mana gaya he
 All actions are attributed to the intellect and intelligence is said to be governed by three qualities
 gita main likhaa he-saare kaary prakruti ke teen gunon dwaara kiye jate hen, ahankaaravash manushya apane ko karta maan letaa he
 In the Gita itself, the numerical five reasons for each karma have been enumerated, namely, Adhisthana, Kattrta, Karana, Miscellaneous Attempts and Divines; In such a situation one cannot be said to be responsible only for karma
 maikenzi aadi kuch vichaarak ukt donon maton se bhinn aatmanirdharanwad ke siddhant ko maanate hai
 Where a person performs karma in the spirit of freedom, karma itself is determined by the powers inherent in his personality
 is arth main manushya swatantra he
 The feeling of remorse arising after bad work proves the freedom of the doer

 kii duuri par hasdev nadi ke dakshini tat par pithampur main kaleshwarnath kaa ek mandir he
 Janjgir's poet Mr
 Tularam Gopal has considered Pithampur as a mythological city in `` Shivraninarayana and the seven temples ''
 prachlit kinvadanti ko aadhaar maanakar unhone likhaa he ki puranic kaal main dharm vansh ke raja angaraj ke duraachaari putr raja ben praja ke ugr sangharsh main bhaagate hue yahaan aaye or ant main maare gaye
 As Raja Angaraja was very tolerant, kind and religious, so to protect his holy lineage, the sage-monks of the dead body of his ill-fated son, King Ben, churned at this place
 pehle uski jaangh se kurup boune purush kaa janm hua
 Later on the churning of the arms emerged a pair of male and female who were named Prithu and Archi
 rishi-muniyon ne pruthu or archi ko pati-patni ke rup main manyata dekar vidaa kiya
 Here the dwarf ugly man started doing penance for Mahadev
 unki tapasya se prasann hokar mahadev unhen darshan dekar parthiv ling kii sthapana or puja-archana kaa vidhaan bataakar antadhryaan ho gayi
 The dwarf ugly male who had found freedom by worshiping the Kalveshwar Parthiv Lig, had become invisible in the trough of time
 vahi kaalaantar main hirasy taili ko darshan dekar unhen na keval pet rog se mukt kiya balki uske vansbel ko bhi badhaayaa
 The description of the dynasty of Hirasayya in Sri Kaleshwar Mahatmya published in 1954 by Shri Tulsiram Patel is- tehike putr paanch ho bhayau

 Mr
 Pyarelal Gupta has also told Hirasay in 'ancient Chhattisgarh' to get rid of stomach disease by offering prayers at Shiv Temple in Pithampur
 unhone khariyaar ke raja ko bhi pet rog se mukt karne ke liye pithampur yatra karnaa bataaya hai
 It is also mentioned in Bilaspur Vaibhav and Bilaspur District Gazetteer
 lekin janashruti yah he ki pithampur ke kaleshwarnath kii phalgun poornima ko puja-archana or abhishek karne se vansh kii avashya vruddh hoti he
 The zamindars of Khariar who have been told to travel to Pithampur to get rid of stomach disease, had actually come here to increase their lineage

 In time, by the grace of Kaleshwarnath, his two sons, respectively, Arattanadeva and Vijayabhairavadeva, and two daughters Kanak Manjari Devi and Shobhagya Manjari Devi were born
 vansh vruddh hone par unhone pithampur main ek mandir kaa nirmaan karaayaa lekin mandir main murti kii sthapana ke purv 36 varsh kii alpaayu main san 1912 main unka swargvaas ho gaya
 Later the idol of Gauri was installed in that temple by the temple trust
 yahaan ek kinvadanti or prachlit he jiske anusaar ek baar naga sadhu ke aashirwad se kuleen parivaar kii ek putravadhu ko putraratna kii prapti hui
 Knowing this incident, the following year many women came here for longing for the son of sons, which caused a lot of trouble to the Naga sadhus and their numbers gradually started to decrease

 But it is true that even today, many couples come here with their wishes, and after fulfilling their wishes, next year they go to darshan on the ground
 pithampur ke kaal kaleshwarnath kii lila aparampar he
 Bharatendu poet of Chhattisgarh Shri Varanat Singh Chauhan has described the importance of Pithampur in a book titled 'shivarinarayan Mahatmya and Panchkosi Yatra': - hasado nadi ke tir main, kaleshwarnath bhagwaan
 Whatever you do, darshan will be done

 According to the inscription on the wall of Kaleshwarnath temple in Pithampur, Shri Jagmal Gangaji contractor Kutch Kumbharia built this temple on Kartik Sudi 2, Samvat 1755 with Gokul Dhanji Mistry
 champa ke padit chhavinath dvivedi ne san 1897 main sanskrit main ``kalishwar mahatmaya strotram`` likhakar prakaashat karaayaa tha
 In this book, he has described the emergence of Kaleshwarnath as Chaitra Krishna Pratipada in 1940
 mandir nirmaan sanwat 1949 main shuru hokar sanwat 1953 main puraa hone, isi varsh murti kii pratishtha hirasy taili ke haathon karaaye jane tathaa mela lagane kaa ullekh he
 Similarly, Mahant Swami Dayanand Bharti of Pithampur Math was also published in Sanskrit in 1953 by writing 'sri Shankar Mahatmya of Pithampur'
 36 “lok main unhone pithampur ke shavji ko kaal kaleshwar mahadev, pithampur main champa ke sanathan dharm sanskrit pathashla kii shakha khole jane, san 1953 main hi tilbhandeshwar, kaashi se chaandi ke panchmukhi shavji kii murti banavaakar laane or usee varsh se pithampur ke meley main shavji kii shobhaayatra nikalne kii baton kaa ullekh kiya he
 He mentions the establishment of a monastery in Pithampur and the names of ten Mahants in its 50 years in this sense
 is mahatmaya ko likhane kii prerana unhen pandit shavshankar rachit or san 1914 main jabalpur se prakaashat ``pithampur mahatmaya`` ko padhakar mili

 1945, phalgun poornamasi yane holi ke din se is shankar dev sthaan pithampur kii khyaati hui
 Similarly, Shri Tulsiram Patel has written in Pithampur: Shri Kaleshwar Mahatmya that Pt
 Ramnarayan Pathak, the father of Teerth Purohit Kashiprasad Pathak, a resident of Pithampur, installed the Shivalinga to Hirasayi Teli on 1945
 tathy chaahe jo bhi ho, mandir ati pracheen he or yah maanane main bhi koi harj nahin he ki jab shri jagamaal gangji thekedaar ne sanwat 1755 main mandir nirmaan karaayaa he to avashya murti kii sthapana uske purv ho chuki hogi
 


 and a gap of 185 years is enough for a temple to collapse
 at: yah maanane main bhi koi harj nahin he ki 185 varsh baad uskaa pun: udbhav sanwat 1940 main hua ho or mandir kaa nirmaan karaayaa gaya hoga jisamen mandir ke purv main nirmaan karaane vaale shalaalekh ko pun: diwaar main jad diya gaya hoga
 The fair started in Pithampur with the construction of Kaal Kaleshwar Nath Temple
 prarambh main yahaan kaa mela phalgun poornima se caitra panchami tak hi lagata tha, aage chalakar meley kaa vistaar hua or imperial gajetir ke anusaar 10 din tak mela lagane laga
 Naga Sadhus from this place started coming from many places like Allahabad, Banaras, Haridwar, Rishikesh, Nashik, Ujjain, Amarkantak and Nepal etc
 unki upasthiti meley ko jeevant bana detii thi
 In the fair, a procession of Kala Kaleshwar Mahadev's procession was carried out on Panchami
 kadachit shav baraat ke is shobhaayatra ko dekhakar hi tulsi ke janmaandh kavi shri narsinghdaas ne udaya main shavaine likhaa
 In Chhattisgarhi at the end of education, the imagination of Shiv Baaraat has been realized

 Paṇḍitarāja Jagannātha mahākaviḥ :khaṇḍavilli Sūryanārāyaṇaśāstrī Bharateeya Vidya Niketan, 1983 Dimensional analysis is a conceptual tool used in physics, chemistry, technology, mathematics and statistics
 yah vahaan upyogi hota he jahaan kai tarah kii bhautik rashiyaan kisi ghatana ke parinaam ke liye jimmedaar hon
 Physicists often use it to check the validity of an equation etc
 duusari taraf iskaa upyog jatil bhautik sthitiyon se sambandhit charon ko aapas main sameekaran dwaara jodne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 These possible equations obtained by the method of dimensional analysis are tested by experiment, or viewed in the light of other theories
 buckingham kaa pai prameya, vimiya vishleshan kaa aadhaar he
 In the book 'principia' written by Newton, dimensions and dimensional analysis are described as 'theory of analogy'
 is vishay ko badhaane main jin logon ne yogadan diya he, ve hai : i
 buckingham, lard rali or pi
 dablyoo
 brijman 
 Initially dimensional analysis was used in the problems of mechanics, but nowadays it is being used in all kinds of physics and engineering problems
 vimiya vishleshan kaa maan uski is kshamta main he ki bhautikavigyaani or ejeeniyar ke pratidin kii saidhantik evam praayogic samasyaon ke samaadhaan main yah sahaayak hota he
 The entire physical quantities are divided into two classes: yantric samasyaon main teen spasht praathmik raashiyon, lambaai, dravyaman, tathaa samay, ko manyata mili thi
 But if we also use them for magnetic, electrical and thermal quantities, then we have to forcefully include two other zodiac signs
 anya sabhi vyutpann bhautik raashiyon ko in paanch moulik raashiyon ke padon main vyakt kar sakate hai
 Later, the ultimate temperature and light intensity were also accepted as the basic unit
 udhaaharan ke liye, bal kii vimaa m l T-2, ooshmaa chaalakata kii vimaa l m T-3 q-1 or dharita kii vimaa Q2 T2 M-1 L-2 hai
 The unit method is used in actual use: kuch yantric raashiyon kii vimayein tathaa maatrak neeche kii sarini main die gayi hai
 The form of an equation does not depend on the fundamental units of measurement, then it is called dimensionally homogeneous
 udhaaharan ke liye, saral lolak kaa dolankaal t = * 0
5 maanya he chaahe lambaai foot yaa meter main naapi gai ho, athwa samay t minute yaa second main napa gaya ho
 The first step of dimensional analysis of a question decides the variables in the question
 yadi ghatana main ve char, jo vastav main prabhaavaheen hai, prayukt hote hai, to antim sameekaran main badi sankhya main pad dikhaai padenge
 We then compute the complete set of non-discrete products of the given variable-set and write a general relationship between them
 is sambandh main i
 bakinham dwaara pranit nimnlikhit moulik prameya mahatvapurn he : Inversely: It can be said that if the relation of the original variables can be changed to the lowest set of products of these variables, then all these products will be devoid of
 bakinham kaa prameya, jise dwitiya prameya bhi kehete hai, vimiya vishleshan ke sampurna siddhant kaa saransh prastut karata he
 Pressure decreases as fluid flows through a pipe
 mana yah kami nimnlikhit raashiyon par nirbhar karti he- Where a { \ displaystyle A} to f { \ displaystyle F} are constant numbers
 or, By simplifying the dimensions of the zodiacs on both sides, vimiya vishleshan ke siddhanth ke anusaar, ek hi bhautik raashi par donon taraf ghaat samaan honge
 Therefore uparokt samikarnon ko hal karne par Finally, the following formulas are obtained: jahaan Re – renlds sankhya, Eu – iller sankhya he
