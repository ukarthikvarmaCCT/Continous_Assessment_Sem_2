 escobar monkada or galiano bhaaiyon ko laa catedral laakar unki htya kar di kyonki unpar yah aarope tha ki unhone cartil se chori kii thi
 On 22 July 1992, when the government came to know that Escobar was carrying out his criminal activities inside La Catedral, he tried to send Escobar to another prison
 But Escobar's influence informed him of this plan beforehand and in time helped him to escape well there
 Although he was still thinking that he would have been extradited to the United States
 1992 main delta force or centra spike ke united estate operators escobar ke talaashi abhiyaan shaamil ho gaye
 He trained and counseled a special Colombian police task force, called Search Block, to search for Escobar
 Later, conflicts between Escobar and the United States and Colombian governments intensified, and his enemies grew rapidly, including a vigilante group called Los Peps - or "people persecuted by Pablo Escobar" who were his enemies and former Was funded by peers, as well as the Right Wing paramilitary force led by Cali Cartel and Carlos Castano, who later called the Kiroboda and Uraba Farmers formed self-defense forces

 Rumors quickly spread that members of the search block and the intelligence agencies of Colombia and the United States, along with them either colluding with Los Peps or guiding both search blocks and Los Peps together, to search for Escobar
 And she was trying her best to punish him

 a very popular belief is that Hugo Aguilar did the job of Escobar with just one shot from his 9 mm pistol
 Some family members believe that Escobar may have committed suicide
 Two of his brothers, Roberto Escobar and Fernando Sánchez Erilano, believe he shot himself in the ear: "he committed suicide, he was not killed
 unase bichhadne ke baad ke varshon ke dauraan, ve mujhase har din yahi kehete rahe ki agar unke paas sachmuch batch nikaalane kaa koi rasta nahin bachegaa, to ve apane kaanon par goli markar khud ko khatm kar lenge

 According to this legend, when Indra and other gods became weak due to the curse of Maharishi Durvasa, the demons attacked and defeated the gods
 tab sab devtaa milakar bhagwaan vishnu ke paas gaye or unhe sara vrutant sunaaya
 Then Lord Vishnu along with the demons advised him to churn the Kshirsagar and extract the nectar
 bhagwaan vishnu ke aisa kehane par sampurna devtaa daityon ke saath sandhi karke amrit nikaalane ke ytn main lag gaye
 At the behest of the nectar Kumbh, at the behest of the gods, Indraputra 'jayant' flew into the sky carrying the nectar-urn
 uske baad daityaguru shukracharya ke aadeshaanusaar daityon ne amrit ko waapas lene ke liye jayant kaa peechha kiya or ghor parishram ke baad unhone bich raste main hi jayant ko pakadaa
 After that, there was a continuous war for twelve days among the Devas and Demons to take control of the Amrit Kalash
 is paraspar markat ke dauraan prithvi ke chaar sthanon par kalash se amrit boonden giri thim
 At that time, the Moon protected the Ghata from transmitting, the Sun from erupting, the Guru from the abduction of the demons, and Shani protecting the deity from Devendra's fear
 kalah shant karne ke liye bhagwaan ne mohini rup dhaaran kar yathadhikaar sabko amrit baantkar pilaa diya
 Thus the Dev-demon war was ended

 The twelve days of the gods are comparable to the twelve years of humans

 Many people believe that the use of larger wheels automatically increases vehicle performance, handling and suspension, yet a test was conducted on the car and driver using different wheels ranging in size from 15 "to 19"
 All these were tires of the same type and model and were equally equipped, as a result of this test it was found that both types of big wheels fueled The savings were reduced by 0-60 times
 He also observed that larger wheels have a negative impact on the conduction facility and the noise it produces

 Michael then discovers Hanna's secret: he is illiterate and has kept it hidden for a lifetime
 anya mahila guard jo yah daawa karti hai ki usne yah report likhi, ve haina par isaki jimmedaari kaa ilzaam lagane ke liye jhooth bol rahi hai
 Michael informs Rall that he has favorable information from one of those accused but is not convinced to do anything because she does not want to disclose it

 aap is par bhi bahes kar sakate he ki film vastav main hollocost ke bare main nahin he balki us peedi ke bare main he jo iske saaye main palaa-badha jis par pustak main bhi jor diya gaya he
 But the film is neither about the Holocaust nor about the Germans who are attached to its heritage: it is about making the audience feel good about a historical tragedy that is dim with every new interesting trajectory

 Ron Rosenbaum was highly critical of the film's determination on Hanna's illiteracy
 "itnaa sab kuch nirakshartaa kii gahari se gahari shame se nirmit he -- is tathy ke baavjood ki 300 logon ko jalaakar maar daalane main padhane kii dakshata kii aavashyaktaa nahin he -- ki upanyaas ke kuch poojaneey vrittant vastav main yah pushti karte hue prathit hote hai ki nirakshartaa, samuhik hatya main bhaag lene se bhi zyada shame kii baat he
 

 Lack of reading efficiency is more embarrassing than hearing the screams of 300 people silently as animals when they are burnt to death in a closed church while guarding you to prevent them from escaping the fire

 She praised Winslet and Cross for "daring, intense performances" and said that Allin and Ganz had turned into "memorable realities"
 unhone likhaa he ki "uttam peshewar polish" ke liye is film par chhayakaar kris menges or roger diekins kaa ek udhaar he
 Colm Andrew of Manx Independent also rated it high, stating that the film had "countless opportunities to become overly emotional or dramatic and that it stops each of them, which in turn leads to the conclusion that you don't know in this film that What quality to be praised "

 Meteorology or meteorology is a science covering many disciplines which studies the atmosphere
 mausam vigyaan main mausam kii prakriya evam mausam kaa purvanumaan adhyayan ke kendrabindu hote hai
 The history of meteorology is thousands of years old, but there was no significant progress till the 18th century
 unnisvin shatee main vibhinn deshon main mausam ke aakadon ke prekshan se isamen gati aayi
 In the second half of the twentieth century, there was a revolution in this area by the use of computers to forecast the weather
 mausam vigyaan ke adhyayan main prithvi ke vayumandal ke kuch charon kaa prekshan bahut mahatv rakhata he; ye char hai - taap, hawa kaa daab, jal vaashp yaa ardrata aadi
 The value of these variables and their rate of change determine the weather to a great extent
 rituvigyaan vayumandal kaa vigyaan he
 In modern meteorology, physical phenomena occurring in the atmosphere and their associated sub-shells and water-solids are studied
 rituvigyaan ke vishay kaa varnan, jahaan tak uskaa sambandh nichle vayumandal kii mausami ghatnaon se hai, adhiktam suvidhapurvak nimnlikhit chaar bhaagon main kiya ja saktaa he: Mechanical meteorology, which is concerned with the observations and observations by which the weather conditions of the atmosphere are reported
 bhautik tathaa gatik rituvigyaan jisamen prekshit ritu sambandhi ghatnaon kaa gunatmak tathaa parimanik vivechan kiya jaataa he
 Concise meteorology, which is primarily concerned with the study of concise observational observations by concatenation maps for weather forecasts

 In the weather observations, which give knowledge of the state of the atmosphere, the following things are seen: vaayu kaa taap tapamapi dwaara napa jaataa he
 This thermometer is kept unaffected by solar radiation
 vaayu kii ardrata gyaat karne ke liye geele tapamapi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 a single fold of wet muslin cloth is wrapped on this thermometer bulb
 ardrata kii maatra sookhe tharmametre tathaa geele tharmametre ke pathyankon se nikaali jaati he
 It is measured by an aerodynamic and it reflects the weight of air on the earth
 pawan kii disha tathaa veg kaa prekshan kiya jaataa he
 The direction is taken from where the wind comes and is marked in 16 or 32 points of the compass
 veg pawan-vegamapi dwaara mapa jaataa he or mile prati ghanta yaa kilometre prati ghanta yaa meter prati second main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Humidity leads to knowledge of the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere and, as stated earlier, it is measured by dry and wet thermometers
 isamen vayumandaleey sanghanan ke sab prakaar ke drav evam thos utpaadan sanmilit hai
 The quantity of clouds and their types, fog and rain, snow, hail, etc
 are observed
 prayek prakaar kaa badal akaash ke jitne bhaag main vyaapt ho utane ko puure akaash ke dashanshon main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Condensation particles that are large enough to fall on the earth in the form of rain

 In the first half of the 20th century, due to the increase in observations of wind velocity and direction, etc
 up to a height of 20 kilometers, the information received by the meteorologists was more advanced in meteorology
 upree vaayu ke aise prekshanon se rituvigyaan kii anek samasyaon ko samajhane main bahut adhik sahaayta mili
 During the First World War period , more and quicker observations of atmospheric conditions were required, for which arrangements were made by aircraft to take up meteorological instruments

 In the Second World War period, the demand for weather information mainly for the use of high-flying airplanes increased and the radar method was developed for the knowledge of the velocity and direction of air, etc
 at different heights, to meet this demand
 nichle vayumandal kii sukhi vaayu main anek gaison kaa mishran hota he jinamein mukhyat: nitrogen 78 pratishat, oxijan 21 pratishat, aragan 0

 In the atmosphere, only water vapor is the element whose physical state changes under normal atmospheric conditions
 at: vayumandal main jalawaashp kii pratishat aaytan maatra bahut ghatati badhati rahati he
 Increasing the occurrence of water vapor in the atmosphere is extremely important for meteorology
 jal kaa vashpikaran tathaa sanghanan isliye mahatvapurn he ki na keval inase ek sthaan se duusare sthaan ko jal kaa parivahan hota he, varan isliye bhi ki jal ke vashpikaran ke liye gupt ushma ke avasorana kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It finally reappears and is used to heat the air when condensation of water vapor occurs again in condensation and snow

 This situation shows the rate of pressure change at any level with height
 yadi do dabastaron ke bich kaa daab antar ho or donon staron ke bich urdhwadhar duuri ho, ghanatv ho or gurutvajanit twaran ho, to This equation is called the hydrostatic equation

 Therefore, the vertical pressure in the atmosphere is highly variable
 68 kimi ke neeche daab kii ganana ke liye do sutara prayog main laaye jate hai
 The first formula is used when the standard temperature LSP rate is not zero
 duusare kaa prayog tab karte hai jab maanak taap leps dar shunya ho

 The authentic altimeter is based on this formula
 din ke samay surya se garmi milane or raat main vikiran dwaara prithvi ke thandi hone se vaayu ke taap main dainik parivartan utpann hota he
 The minimum temperature is slightly before sunrise and the maximum temperature is in the third hour
 vaayu ke taap kaa yah dainik parivartan bhootal ke upar se mukt vayumandal main shighrata se ghatata he
 The daily range of heat has not been found to exceed 2 ° or 3 ° c in most parts of the earth at altitudes of more than 5,000 feet and in desert regions at 10,000 feet

 This solar insolation energy is about 1
94 grams per square square centimeter per minute before entering the atmosphere at a moderate distance between the Earth and the Sun; The restriction here is that the rays of the sun fall on that square centimeter
 is maatra ko saura niyatank kehete hai
 Irregular curves found in the value of solar constant are less than one percent; These can be caused by observations

 This is 43 percent
 shesh 57 pratishat urja, jo prabhavakaari aatapan he, bhootal tathaa vayumandal ko ausatan 57 ushma ikaiyaan pradaan karata he
 Out of these 57 heat units, only a small part of the atmosphere is absorbed by the atmosphere, mainly by water vapor in the lower levels and by ozone in the upper stratosphere to a lesser extent
 vayumandal main vaashpan tathaa sanghanan kaa kaaran he vaayu kii jalawaashp grahan karne kii shakti main kami beshi, arthath ardra vaayu kaa garam yaa sheethal hona
 Generally the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is less than the saturated volume, especially near the ground floor where the effective insolubility of the atmosphere is maximum
 vaayu main nami kaa adhik bhaag, jo vayumandal main jalawashpachakr ko chalaata rahata he, vaashpan se praapt hota he
 As the water evaporates, it continues to diffuse into the atmosphere
 vayumandal main vaashpan dwaara honevaali mausami kriyaayein apekshaakrit mahatvapurn nahin hotin
 The evolution of visible steam is also a seasonal activity by evaporation
 garam jal kii sataha se shighratapurvak vaashpan hone ke kaaran bahut thandi athwa apekshaakrit thandi ardra vaayu ekadam ati santrupt ho jaati he
 This results in instant condensation of moisture in the form of visible steam, causing a dense fog in the stagnant air
 sanghanan kisi khuli sataha par us samay hota he jab us sataha kaa taap aasapaas kii vaayu ke osank ke taap se kam hota he
 Examples of this type of condensation are found in hot climates
 jaise, yadhyapi vaayu kii aapekshik ardrata sau pratishat se paryaapt kam rahane par bhi barf ke pani se bhare gilaas ke baahar vaayu kaa vaashp sanghanit ho jaataa he usee prakaar svachh prashanth raatri main os kaa sanghanan un bhootalsthit vastuon par ho jaataa he jo apni ooshmaa ke vikiran ke kaaran aasapaas kii vaayu ke osank se nimna taap tak thandi ho jaati hai, paala un satahon par jamata he jo hinma se bhi adhik thandi ho jaati hai, chaahe mukt vaayu kaa taap himank se kaaphi unchaa kii kyon na ho
 When condensation takes place in the form of small short bursts within the atmosphere, the question arises as to how this process begins
 prayog se siddh hua he ki purnat: ashuddhiheen vaayu main sanghanan jalbindu ke rup main nahin hota, chaahe usamen vashpadaab santrupti daab se das guni hi kyon na ho
 It seems that some kind of particles are not required to start condensation of water vapor which is not present in pure air
 is prakaar ke kan ko sanghanan nabhik kehete hai
 Tests have revealed that tiny particles of hydrophobic substances in the air, such as sea salt particles, act as condensation nuclei
 jin sthanon main kaarkaanon kaa dhuaan vayumandal ko dooshit kar detaa he, vahaan dhuen ke gandhak, phosforus aadi padaartho ke oxide ke nanhen kan sanghanan nabhik ban jate hai
 Generally, the fog and clouds of the lower troposphere contain tiny tobodies, ranging from hundred to ten thousand per cubic centimeter

 If long-term daily seasonal maps are tested, it is known that there are two types of flow forms in them: alpajivi shighragami pratichakravaat tathaa avdaab 
 After this type of whirlpool starts from one day to one month it ends and then becomes completely invisible with maps

 It is clear that the two images in the two pictures are similar in some respects
 donon maheenon main prithvi ke samast bumadhyarekhiy pradesh main ek apekshaakrit alp, kintu atyant ekasmaan, daab kaa akhand katibandh he
 In the January month it is somewhat north of the tropical equator, but in July month it is either exactly on that line or slightly south

 This wide tropics is called the subtropical overgrowth which is a permanent form of normal communication in both hemispheres
 uposhnavalayik adhidaab katibandh ke dakshin main vayudab dakshin kii ore baraabar girti jaati he or antarctic mahadweep ke upar nunatam ho jaati he
 The following three primary pressure zones are introduced in the Northern Hemisphere: bumadhyarekhiy alpadaab katimbdh, jo donon golardhon main samaan rup se vidyaman rahata he
 The subtropical overpressure is completely different in this hemisphere
 janvari maas main yah samudron par lagbhag 25°-35° uttar main rahata he
 But in high latitudes above the continents, it is related to systems of high pressure
 ye dabpranaliyaan lakshan main ekadam bhinn hoti hai or isliye uposhnavalayik adhi-daab-katibandh ko samudron tak hi simit samajhnaa uchit he
 The sub-dipole tropic tropics are clearly visible on the map of January month
 is katibandh main do bade alpadaab kshetra iceland tathaa alusian dwipon par hai, jo krmanusaar uttartam atlantic mahaasaagar par tathaa uttartam pacific mahaasaagar par vistrut hai
 In between these two areas there is an area of relatively high pressure on the pole
 greeshm ritu main ye alpadaab bahut ksheen hote hai
 The Alushian region then disappears
 dhruvon par vayudab apekshaakrit adhik rahati he
 The discrepancy in the integrity of the subtropical overgrowth and subipolar torsion is due to new and unknown elements that are lacking in the Southern Hemisphere
 gaun sanchaar chaahe pratichakravaati hon yaa chakravaati, unka lakshan yah he ki ek yaa adhik samadab rekhaayen adhidaab kendron yaa alpadaab kendron ko chaaron ore se gherkar band kar detii hai
 Thus the overload area and the low pressure area are the local areas of excess or decrease of the weight of the atmosphere in order
 gaun sanchaar do prakaar ke hote hai : pratyaksht: ushmiya or gatik athwa pranodith 
 Thermal overgrowth and under pressure are usually caused by the cooling or heating of a particular part of the lower atmosphere
 gatik adhidaab tathaa alpadaab donon hi saamaanya sanchaar kii vayudharaon kii parsparik yantric kriyaaon ke kaaran nirmit hote hai
 Evidently thermal secondary communications include the flow and thermodynamic effects

 Now this word has also been applied to some other winds which are long and regular in different directions of the year from adverse directions
 in pawanon ke chalane kaa praathmik kaaran thal tathaa samudri kshetron ke tapon kaa ritujanit antar he
 They resemble the wind land and the hydropower, but they have a duration of one year instead of one day and they run on very wide areas rather than limited areas
 monsoon ko hindi main pawas kehete hai
 Meteorological changes of heat near the equator are generally too small for the growth of the monsoon

 In such a situation, the regions most favorable for the development of the monsoon are in the middle latitudes near the incubation
 sthal kii ore chalanevaale pawanon main vidyaman ardrata kii maatra kaa tathaa sthal kii ruparekha kaa pawasvarsha par atyant prabhaav padataa he
 Due to the aforementioned consistency of various events, the maximum growth of the monsoon is on East and South Asia and in many parts of these regions, the southwestern summer moving monsoon is an important part of the climate

 Apart from the southern parts of South Pradesh, where these winds do not reach due to the cover of the hills of the Western Ghats, all parts of India receive heavy rainfall during the monsoon period
 yah varsha lagbhag purnataya sanvahneey hoti he
 For its progress, the conversion of vapor into water is controlled mainly by the heating of the surface and its height

 There is excessive rainfall in these parts
 kabhi kabhi gangaghati kii droni main bahut der tak vistrut varsha hoti rahati he
 This continuous rainfall is often due to the shallow avalanches which run at a slow speed in the west direction towards the main footfall
 bhartiya pawas kii shakti bahut ghatati badhati rahati he
 When the monsoon is intense, the rainfall in most parts of India is much higher than the average and the rainfall is less when the monsoon is light

 It is also said that if Gaurang had not been there, Vrindavan would have been a myth till today
 vaishnav log to inhen shrikrishna kaa radha rani ke sanyog kaa avatar maanate hai
 Many texts have been written over Gaurang, the chief of which is Sri Krishnadasa Kaviraj Goswami Virchita Chaitanya Charitamrit
 iske alaava shri vrundavan das thakur rachit chaitanya bhagwat tathaa lochandas thakur kaa chaitanya mangal bhi hai
 According to Chaitanya Charitamrit, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was born Phalgun Shukla Purnima of 1486 in a village called Navdwip in West Bengal, now called Mayapur
 inkaa janm sandhyakaal main singh lagn main chandra grahan ke samay hua tha
 At that time, many people were going to the Ganges bath, chanting Harinam, wishing for purification
 tab vidwaan brahmanon ne unki janmkundalee ke grahon or us samay upasthit shagun kaa faladesh karte hue yah bhavishyavaanee kii, ki yah balak jivan paryant harinaam kaa prachaar karegaa
 Although he was called Vishwambhar in his childhood, all called him Nimai, as he says he was found under a Neem tree
 gauravarna kaa hone ke kaaran log inhen gaurang, gaur hari, gaur sundar aadi bhi kehete the
 His father's name was Jagannath Mishra and mother's name was Shachi Devi
 nimai bachapan se hi vilakshan pratibha sampann the
 Also, he was very simple, beautiful and emotional
 inke dwaara kii gai lilaon ko dekhakar har koi hatprabh ho jaataa tha
 At a very young age, Nimai became adept in justice and grammar
 inhone kuch samay tak nadia main skool sthapit karke adhyaapan kaary bhi kiya
 Nimai started singing praises to Rama and Krishna from childhood when he was absorbed in Bhagavad Chintan
 15-16 varsh kii avasthaa main inkaa vivaah lakshmipriya ke saath hua
 In 1505, the wife died of snake bite
 vansh chalaane kii vivashtaa ke kaaran inkaa doosraa vivaah navadweep ke rajpandit sanathan kii putree vishnupriya ke saath hua
 His father died when he was a teenager
 san 1509 main jab ye apane pita kaa shraadh karne gaya gaye, tab vahaan inaki bhent ishvarpuri naamak sant se hui
 He asked Nimai to cry krishna-krishna
 tabhi se inkaa sara jivan badal gaya or ye har samay bhagwaan shrikrishna kii bhakthi main leen rahane lage
 Due to his unwavering devotion and faith towards Lord Krishna, he became innumerable followers
 sarvapratham nityanand prabhu va adwaitacharya maharaj inke shishy bane
 Both of these gave a rapid impetus to the Bhakti movement of Nimai
 inhone apane in donon shishyon ke sahyog se dholak, mrudang, jhaanjh, manjire aadi vaadya yantra bajaakar va ucch swar main naach-gaakar hari naam sankirthan karnaa prarambh kiya

 When he used to do kirtan, it seemed as if he is calling God
 san 1510 main sant pravar shri paad keshav bharti se sanyas kii diksha lene ke baad nimai kaa naam krishna chaitanya dev ho gaya
 At the age of just 24, he renounced the householder's ashram and took retirement
 baad main ye chaitanya mahaprabhu ke naam se prakhyat hue
 When Gaurang reached the Jagannath temple for the first time after retiring, he became so engrossed upon seeing the idol of God, that he started dancing frantically, and became unconscious
 sanyog se tab vahaan upasthit prakand pandit saarvbhaum bhattacharya mahaprabhu kii prem-bhakthi se prabhavit hokar unhen apane ghar le gaye
 Sastra-discussion started at home, in which Sovereign began to demonstrate his piety, then Srigaurang proved the importance of devotion far above knowledge and made him see his conspiracy
 saarvbhaum tabhi se gaurang mahaprabhu ke shishy ho gaye or vah ant samay tak unke saath rahe
 Pandit Swayamsevam Bhattacharya praised Gauranka's shat-shloki which is known today as Chaitanya Shatak

 Great wild animals such as lions, tigers and elephants etc
 used to dance in a loving manner before them
 karthik poornima ko ye vrundavan pahunche
 Even today, the arrival of Gaurang is celebrated on the day of Kartik Purnima in Vrindavan
 yahaan inhone imali tala or akrur ghat par nivas kiya
 While living in Vrindavan, he enlightened the spirit of devotion of the people by projecting the importance of ancient Shridham Vrindavan
 yahaan se phir ye prayag chale gaye
 He spread Bhagavadnam Sankirtan by staying at places like Kashi, Haridwar, Shringeri, Kamakoti Peeth, Dwarka, Mathura etc
 chaitanya mahaprabhu ne apane jivan ke antim varsh jagannatha puri main rahakar bitaayen
 It was here that in 1533, at the young age of 47, on the day of Rath Yatra, he departed for the supreme abode of Shri Krishna
 chaitanya mahaprabhu ne logon kii aseem lokapriyata or sneh praapt kiya kehete hai ki unki adbhut bhagavadbhakti dekhakar jagannatha puri ke raja tak unke shricharanon main nat ho jate the

 ve is prakaar hai:-govinddev mandir, gopinath mandir, madan mohan mandir, radha raman mandir, radha damodar mandir, radha shyamsundar mandir or gokulanand mandir
 These are called Saptadevalayas
 log chaitanya ko bhagwaan shrikrishna kaa avatar maanate hai
 Some references to it are also found in ancient Hindu texts

 That is, they can be dissected up to 90% within 6 months by industrial blending process
 jin biopolimaron main yah kshamta hoti he, un par europea maanak ien 13432 ke antargat ek sammishran yogya chinh lagaaya ja saktaa he

 The main differences between polymers and biopolymers are in their structures
 biopolimaron samet polimur monomeron naamak ikaiyon se bane hote hai
 The structure of biopolymers is often well elucidated, although it is not their characteristic feature: in proteins, the correct chemical structure and systemic chain of these units is called the primary structure
 kai boyopolimur swatah hi vishisht aakaaron main dohare ho jate hai, jisase unke jaivik kaaryaklap nirdhaarit hote hai or jo jatil tareeke se unki praathmik rachanaaon par nirbhar hote hai
 The study of the compositional properties of biopolymers is called anatomical biology
 iske vipareet adhikansh sanshleshit polimaron kii rachana kaaphi saral or adhik random hoti he
 a molecular mass distribution is reached by the fact that it is not found in biopolymers
 In fact, since in most life-states their synthesis is controlled by a template-directed process, so all biopolymers of one type are uniform in appearance
 Are - They all have the same series and numbers of monomers and all have equal weight
 is prakriya ko monodispercity kehete hai, jabaki sanshleshit polimaron main polidispercity hoti he
 Consequently, biopolymers have a polydispersity index of 1
 biopolimur saamanytah jaevpindon se utpann hote hai, jo sharkara chukundar, aalu yaa gehun jaisi fasalon se praapt hota he
 When they are used to produce biopolymers, they are classified as usable crops, which can be converted into the following pathways: sharkara chukundar – gliconic acid – poliglonic acid - Starch - Lactic acid - Polylactic acid jaevpind – – byoithenal – ethane - polithilin Biopolymers are renewable, durable and can be neutral to carbon biopolimur akshay hai kyonki ve vanaspati padaarthon se banate hai jinhen anwarat rup se har varsh ugaaya ja saktaa he
 These plant materials originate from agricultural non-food crops
 isaliye biopolimaron kaa prayog ek sthaayee udyog kaa nirmaan kar saktaa he
 In contrast, the materials obtained from the petrochemicals required for polymers will eventually run out
 In addition, biopolymers can reduce carbon emissions and decrease the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere
 aisa isaliye sambhav he kyonki unke avakrameekaran ke samay utsarjit CO2 unke sthaan par ugaai gai fasalon dwaara avashoshit kar lee jaati he, jisase ve carbon ke prati tatasth ho jate hai
 Biopolymers are biodegradable and some can also be composted
 kuch biopolimur jaev avakramakaraniya hote hai – ve sookshmjeevanuon dwaara CO2 or jal main vichchhedit kar diye jate hai
 In addition, some of these biodegradable biopolymers can be composted - they can be put into the process of industrial blending, with up to 90% of their parts dissected within 6 months
 jo biopolimur iske liye sakasham hote hai unhen european maanak ien 13432 ke antargat ek sammishran yogya nishaan se chinhit kiya ja saktaa he
 Sugar-based biopolymers do not often follow convention
 The sugars can be polymer-lined or branch off by joining glycosidic bonds
 in jodon kaa sahi sthaan bhinn ho saktaa he or jodne vaale kriyaatmak samoohon kii disha bhi mahatvapurn hoti he, jiske kaaran ring main jodne vaale carbonon ke sthaan ke anusaar kramank vaale α- or β-glycosidic band banate hai
 Additionally, many saccharide units can undergo various chemical changes, such as amination, and may also form part of other molecules such as glycoproteins
 vastuon main audyogic prayog ke liye aajkal sabase adhik dhyaan khinchne vaale policecridon main selulose or starch hai
 But more complex carbohydrate polymers resulting from bacteria and mildew are now receiving more attention
 udaahranon main janthan, kardlaan, pululaan or hayaluronic acid shaamil hai
 These polymers usually consist of multiple types of carbohydrate monomers and in many cases these polymers have regular branched compositions
 udhaaharan ke liye starch shakhit or rekhaakaar polimaron kaa ek bhautik sanyog hota he, lekin usamen keval ek hi prakaar kaa carbohydrate hota he – glucose
 celulose or starch donon saikadon yaa hajaaron glucopayaranosaida ikaayiyon se bane hote hai
 These units are joined by acetal bonds between the carbon atom of cyclic glucose in one unit and the hydroxyl group in the adjacent unit
 starch vanaspatiyon main vyapak rup se paaya jane vaala ek polimur he

 Selective chemical degradation of semi-crystalline polymer samples reveals some characteristic changes
 avakraman ke samay, namoonay kii sphatikta pehle to teji se babbti he, phir sphatikta ke 100% hone ke saath uski dar kaaphi kam ho jaati he
 This is probably related to the eventual disappearance of the alkaline parts of the sample

 Scanning electron microscopy has shown that partial degradation of crystalline polycaprolactone film by fibrous mildew is characteristic, in which the aliphatic parts are degraded before the crystalline parts
 sookshmjeevanu chuninda avakraman ke liye jimmedaar bahyakoshikeey anzimon kaa utpaadan karte hai
 This selectivity is possible due to the less regular arrangement of the osmotic parts, making it easier for the enzymes to reach the polymer chains

 Many plastics do not promote the growth of microorganisms
 Hydrocarbons with low molecular weight can be degraded by microorganisms
 inhen sookshmjeevanu koshikaon dwaara lekar, koenzime-e se jodakar sakriy kiya jaataa he or koshikeey chayapachay utpaadon main badal diya jaataa he
 But these processes do not work well in the extracellular environment and plastic molecules are so large that they cannot penetrate inside the cell
 This is not the problem with natural molecules such as starch and cellulose, as changes in fractions with less molecular weight than enzyme reactions occur outside the microbe's cell
 lekin, prakaatvakraman yaa rasaynic avakraman anubhaar ko is had tak kam kar saktaa he ki sookshmjeevanuon kaa akraman sambhav ho jaay
