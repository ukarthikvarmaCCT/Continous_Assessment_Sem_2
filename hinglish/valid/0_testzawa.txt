 taal ek prakaashiya yukti he jo prakaash ke apvartan ke siddhanth par kaam karata he
 Taal is a transparent medium surrounded by two surfaces of regular, geometric form such as spherical, cylindrical, etc
, which form an actual or imaginary reflection of an object after refraction
 uttal taal masoor kii akruti kaa hota he
 The surface of the palate is usually spherical, but cylindrical, or agoli palms are also used as needed
 aankh ke crystalia taal hi ekmaatr prakritik taal he
 Thousands of years ago, people knew about the rhythm and according to Maisner, in ancient times even glasses were benefited
 chashmen ke alaava prakashvigyaan main taal kaa upyog doordarshee, sookshmdarshi, prakashastambh, dwinetri ityadi main hota he
 Rhythm can be mainly divided into two classes, anant se aanevaali samaantar kiran uttal lens main apvartan ke pashchaat bindu pha par abhisarit hokar vahaan vaastavik pratibimb bana rahi he; jabaki avatal taal main apvartan ke pashchaat ve bindu "pha" par bane kaalpanik pratibimb se apsaarit hoti prathit hoti hai
 Therefore, convex pool is also called 'convergent pool' and concave pool is also called 'upsari pool'
 yahan yah jaan lenaa aavashyak he ki uttal taal abhisari taal or avatal taal apsaari taal ke rup main tabhi kaam karata he, jab uske chaaron taraf ke madhyam kaa apvartanaank taal ke madhyam ke apvartanaank se kam hota he
 = 1
5, refractive index of air is mu = 1
00)
 yadi chaaron taraf ke madhyam kaa apvartanaank taal ke madhyam ke apvartanaank se adhik hoga, to uttal taal apsaari or avatal taal abhisari ho jayega
 The focus distance of a rhythm can be derived from the following formula
 is sutara ko taal-nirmaataa kaa sutara kehete hai
 Where yadi d kaa maan R1 or R2 kii tulana main chota ho to ise 'patala taal' kahenge
 For this, the formula for focus distance will be as follows lenson main prakaashiya varna-vipathan kii samasya paayi jaati he
 In many cases, this problem can be removed to a large extent by the combination of two complementary chromatic aberration lenses
 yadi alag-alag aakaar ke evam alag-alag padaarth ke saral lenson ko ek ke baad ek kram main lagaaya jaay to ise yogic taal kehete hai
 The simplest case is one in which the rhythms are placed adjacent to each other
 yadi f1 or f2 focus duuri vaale do patale taal sataakar rakhe jate hai to unki sammilit focus duuri f kaa maan nimnlikhit sutara se nikaala jaayegaa- Since 1 / f is called the power of the rhythm, it can be said that the powers of the lens are also added when coupled
 kintu yadi do patale taal paraspar d duuri par rakhe jany to sanyukt taal tantra kii focus duuri is sutara se niklegi- Eyeglasses have a thinner rhythm and are also made in the same manner described earlier
 parantu isaki sataha kaa utana yatharth hona aavashyak nahin he jitna un lenson kii sataha kaa jo doordarshee or photography main prayukt hote hai
 The edges of the palate are glued to the stone wheel to form the shape of the eyeglass frame
 nikat drushti dosha ko dur karne ke liye avatal taal or dur drushti dosha ko dur karne ke liye uttal taal prayukt hota he
 a cylindrical rhythm is used to remove impurities of immobility
 yadi is dosha ke saath saath nikat drushti, yaa dur drushti, kaa dosha bhi ho, to goleey belanaakaar taal prayukt hota he
 The power of such lenses in the direction of the vertical axis is different from the power of the rhythm in the direction of the horizontal axis
 jaradur drushti ke dosha ko dur karne ke liye dwifokasi taal kaam main aata he, jisamen avatal tathaa uttal ek hi taal main donon tarah ke taal sanyukt rahete hai
 The upper part is for viewing distant objects and the lower part is for viewing of nearby objects
 kaanch ko ek vishesh prakaar kii mashin par ghiskar dwifokasi, taal taiyaar karte hai
 Nowadays, usually both types of lenses are heated and combined in a furnace to create a bifocal rhythm, and the rhythm formed in this way is called the melody bifocal rhythm

 After 1945, thin frennel pools were also made by dissolving plastic materials, which are often used as enclosure pools

 Richard Dawkins (born 26 March 1941) is a British evolutionary biologist and author
 1995 se 2008 ke dauraan ve oxford vishvavidhyalay main prafesar the
 Through the book "the Sulfish Gene", published in 1976, he popularized the gene-centered sequence evolution and the "mime" hypothesis

 richard dockins ek naastik hai or "bhagwaan ne duniya banaai" mat ke aalochak ke rup main jane jate hai
 In The God Delusion, published in 2006, he stated that it is useless to believe in the existence of a divine world-maker and that religious belief is just an illusion
 janvari 2010 tak is kitaab ke angrezi sanskaran kii 2,000,000 se adhik pratiyaan bechi ja chuki hai or 31 bhashaaon main iske anuwaad kyn ja chuke hai
 In his scientific work in evolutionary biology, Dawkins is best known for the popularity of the gene as a major unit of selection in evolution; This view is most clearly set out in his books: dockins lagaataar vikaas main gaiyr-anukuli prakriyaaon ke bare main uljhan main rahaa he or jin ke "upar" staron par chayan ke bare main he
 They are particularly skeptical about the practical possibility or importance of group selection as a basis for understanding altruism
 yah vyavhaar pehle vikasvaadi virodhabhas ke rup main prakat hota he, kyonki dusron kii madad karne se unhen anmol sansaadhan milte hai or apni fitness kam ho jaati he isse pehle, bahut se logon ne samooh chayan ke ek pahalu ke rup main vyakhya kii thi: vyakti puri tarah se aabaadi yaa prajatiyon ke astitv ke liye jo sabase acha he, vah kar rahe hai
 British evolutionary biologist WD Hamilton used gene-frequency analysis in his coordinated fitness theory to show how hereditary altruistic traits can develop if such altruism has sufficient genetic similarity between actors and recipients
 hamiltan kii samaveshi tab se fitness ko kai tarah ke jeevon par safaltaapurvak lagu kiya gaya he, jisamen insaan shaamil hai
 Likewise, Robert Trivers, thinking in terms of gene-centric models, developed the principle of mutual altruism, whereby one organism benefits another in the expectation of a future reciprocal relationship
 dankins ne in vichaaron ko da swaarthee jin main lokapriy kiya, or unhen apane kaam main viksit kiya

 Critics of Dawkins's biological approach suggest that it is misleading to take genes as a unit of selection; Genes can be better described, they say, as a unit of development
 da swaarthee jin main, dokin bataate hai ki ve jin kii jorge si
 Using Williams's definition of "that which is isolated and reassembled with a passionate frequency
 " ek or aam aapatti he ki ek jin akele nahin batch sakati he, lekin anya ke saath sahyog karnaa chahie ek vyakti kaa nirmaan karne ke liye jin, or isliye ek jin ek swatantra "ikai" nahin ho sakati he
 In the extended phenotype, Dworkin states that from the point of view of an individual gene, all other genes are part of the environment to which it is adapted

 Levontine is not in our genes
 do anya vichaarak jinhen is vishay par aksar dokin ke saath sambhddha mana jaataa he, steven pinkar or dainiel danet; danet ne vikaas ke jin-kendrit drushtikon ko protsaahit kiya he or jeevigyaan main katautee kaa bachaav kiya he
 In his book The Selfish Gene, Dawkins describes the term meme as a text to encourage how Darwin's theories can be extended beyond the realm of genes
 yah unke "pratikrutiyaan" tark ke vistaar ke rup main kiya gaya tha, lekin yah anya lekhakon jaise dainiel dennet or susaan blackmor ke haathon main swayan ke jivan par laga tha
 After these popularity a field was created for the development of memetics, from which Dworkin distanced himself
 daakins kaa mem kisi bhi saanskrithik ikai ko sanderbhit karata he, jo ek paryvekshak kisi vishisht vichaar yaa vichaaron ke set ke pratikruti par vichaar kar saktaa he
 He hypothesized that people could see many cultural institutions as such replicas, typically through communication and contact with humans, which evolved as models of efficient information and behaviors
 kyonki mem hameshaa puri tarah se pratilipi nahin hote hai, ve anya vichaaron se parishkrut, sanyukt, yaa anyathaa sanshodhit ho sakate hai; isse nae mems main parinaam miltaa he, jo swayan ko apane purvavartiyon kii tulana main adhik yaa kam kushal pratikruti sabit kar sakate hai, is prakaar, memon par aadhaarit saanskrithik vikaas kii ek pariklpana ke liye ek ruparekha pradaan karte hai, jo ki jin ke aadhaar par jaivik vikaas ke siddhant ke samaan he
 Although Dworkin invented the term meme, he has not claimed that the idea is entirely novel, and there are other expressions for previous ideas as well

 After learning about Darwinism and scientific reasons, after seeing living things as they are designed, Dawkins lost to the remainder of his religious faith

 Dworkin says that some physicists have used 'god' as a metaphor for the general awe-inspiring mysteries of the universe, which lead to confusion and misunderstanding among people who wrongly think they are a mysterious Talking about existence, which forgives sins, transbans alcohol, or makes people live after they die
 vah stephen je gold ke gaiyr-oplaping magistria ke siddhant se asahmat hai or yah suzav dete hai ki ishwar kaa astitv kisi anya tarah vaigyanik avadharana ke rup main mana janaa chahie

 vah vishwaas-vishwaas maanata he jo sakshya par aadhaarit nahin he - jaisaa ki "duniya kii mahaan buraaiyon main se ek" he
 On his spectrum of divine probability, which has seven levels between 1 and 7, Dworkin states that he is 6

 "I can't know for sure, but i think That God is very unaffiliated, and i live my life on the assumption that he is not there

 He described the creative approach of the young Earth as being only a few thousand years old, "an unsatisfactory, mind-numbing lie"; And in his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker, logic is constantly criticized, in an important creationist argument book, Dworkin argues against the famous clockwork through his book Natural Theology by 18th-century English theologian William Paley, In which Paley argues that just as a clock is very complex and very functional, it exists only due to accident, so All living things too - with their greater complexity - must be purposefully prepared

 If active tuberculosis is not treated, approximately two out of every three patients die
 tapedic ke jin rogiyon kaa upyukt upachaar kiya jaataa he, unamem mrityu dar keval 5 pratishat hoti he
 Standard treatments for TB include isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for two months, followed by only isoniazid and rifampicin for four months
 chah maheene baad aisa mana jaataa he ki rogi kaa upachaar puraa ho gaya he
 
 The standard treatment for this latent tuberculosis is only six to nine months with isoniazid
 agar jeev ko puri tarah se samvedansheel mana jaataa he, to pehle do maheene ke liye isoniyazid, rifampicin or pairazinamide se upachaar kiya jaataa he, uske baad chaar maheene ke liye isoniyazid or rifampicin se upachaar kiya jaataa he
 There is no need to use ethambutol
 tapedic ke upachaar main kaam aane vaali sabhi pehali pankti kii dawaaon ke maanak naam angreji ke teen aksharon ke hai or inkaa sankshipt rup keval ek akshar kaa he
 Common names and acronyms are commonly used in the United States that are not internationally recognized: rifampicin is called rifampin and is abbreviated to RIF; Streptomycin is commonly referred to by its shortened form SM
 isi tarah se dawaaon ke naamon kaa sankshipteekaran bhi ek maanak tareeke se hi kiya jaataa he
 The list of medicines is made using their one-letter abbreviated form, followed by a number prefix, which denotes the number of months of treatment; a subscript indicates an intermittent dose, and if no subscript is applied it means that the dose of the drug will be given daily
 Most treatment procedures initially consist of a high-intensity phase, followed by a continuous phase: a high-intensity phase is given first, followed by a continuous phase, separating the two phases with a slash mark
 Are being given
 isliye This means isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide daily for two months followed by isoniazid and rifampicin three times a week

 The simultaneous use of multiple drugs for the treatment of TB is based on probability
 swatah utparivartan kii aavruti, jiske parinamswaroop ek vishesh dawa ke liye pratirodh utpann ho jaataa he, vah he: EMB ke liye 107 main ek, STM or INH ke liye 108 main 1 or RMP ke liye 1010 main 1
 The patient who has extensive pulmonary TB has about 1012 bacteria in their body and probably contains 105 EMB resistant bacteria, 104 STM resistant bacteria, 104 INH resistant bacteria and 102 RMP resistant bacteria
 pratirodh ke utparivartan anayas or swatantra rup se prakat hote hai, isliye uske ek aise jeevanu kii sharan main jane kii sambhaavna, jo INH or RMP donon ke liye swatah pratirodhi he, hoti he 1 in 108, 1 in 10 x = 1 in 1018 and the probability of going to the shelter of one such bacterium is 1 in 1033 which will be spontaneously resistant to all four drugs
 This is, of course, a simplification, but it is also the right way to explain combination therapy
 or bhi kai saidhantik kaaran hai jo sangyojan chikitsa kaa samarthan karte hai
 The use of different drugs causes a different type of reaction
 INH jeevanu kii pratikruti ke khilaaf jeevanunashak he
 EMB is antibacterial at low doses, but is used in tuberculosis treatment in high, bactericidal doses
 RMP jeevanunashak he or iskaa nih sankramak prabhaav padataa he
 PZA is only a weak bactericidal, but is more effective for bacteria located in acidic environments, in conditions of macrophages or in areas of acute inflammation, rifampicin ke aane se pehle tibi ke sabhi upachaar 18 maah yaa isse bhi lambi avadhi ke liye prayukt kiye jate the
 In 1953, the standard dose of the United Nations was 3SPH / 15PH or 3SPH / 15SH2
 1965 or 1970 ke bich, EMP ne PAS kii jagah le lee
 RMP began to be used for the treatment of TB in 1968, and a 1970 BTS study showed that 2HRE / 7HR was efficacious
 1984 main, ek BTS adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki 2HRZ / 4HR prabhavotpadak tha, iske aprabhavi hone kii dar do saal ke baad 3 pratishat se bhi kam pai gayi
 In 1995, when it was discovered that INH resistance was increasing, it was recommended to mix EMB or STM with BTS: 2HREZ / 4HR or 2SHRZ / 4HR, the same dose currently being used
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne salaah di ki agar 2 maheene ke upachaar ke baad bhi rogi kaa culture positive paaya jaataa he to uske liye HR kii chah maah kii nirantarata pravastha kaa upyog kiya janaa chahie
 And it should also be used in patients with extensive bilateral cavity formation at the beginning of treatment
 dots shabd kaa upyog "pratyaksh prekshit therapy, chota-course " ke liye kiya jaataa he or yah tibi rokane ke liye vishwa swasthya sanghathan kii ek mukhya yojana he
 This includes the government's commitment to control TB, sputum-smear microscopic testing in patients with active TB symptoms, direct observation short-course chemotherapy treatment, a definitive supply of drugs, standardized reporting and recording of cases and treatment outcomes
 
 dablyuechao kii salaah he ki pehle do maah ke liye tibi ke sabhi rogiyon kii therapy prekshit honi chahie : iskaa arth yah he ki rogi ko dekhne vaala swatantra prekshak uske tibi-rodhi upachaar par puri nigaraanee rakhe
 swatantra prekshak aksar koi swasthyaraksha kaaryakarta nahin hota, vah ek dukandaar yaa samaaj main koi bada vyakti yaa isi tarah se koi varisht vyakti ho saktaa he
 Dots are used with intermittent doses
 saptaah main do baar khuraaq bhi prabhavi he lekin dablyuechao ke dwaara isaki salaah nahin di jaati, kyonki isamen galati ke liye margin nahin hota he
 Proper use of dots has a treatment success rate of more than 95 percent and also prevents the development of a strain of resistance to many TB drugs in the future
 dots kaa upyog tapedic ke phir se hone kii sambhaavna ko kam karata he, jiske parinamswaroop upachaar ke safal hone kii dar main kami aati he
 It also includes the fact that in areas where the DOTS strategy is not used, generally fewer standards of security are provided
 jin kshetron main dots kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, vahaan anya suvidhaon ke liye madad kii apeksha karne vaale rogiyon kii sankhya kam hoti he jinhen agyaat upachaar die jate hai or is upachaar ke agyaat parinaam saamne aate hai
 However, if the DOTS program is not implemented or implemented incorrectly, there is no possibility of positive results
 yah kaarykram thik prakaar se lagu kiya jaye or prabhavi rup se kargar ho, iske liye swasthya raksha pradaataaon ko apana puraa yogadan dena hota he, iske liye saarvajanik or nijee chikitsakon ke bich achche link hone chahie, sabake liye swasthya sevaayen uplabdh honi chahie, or jo desh tibi kii rokthaam or iske upachaar ke lakshyon ko paane ke prayaas kar rahen hai, unhen is drushti se vishwastareey sahaayta uplabdh karaayi gayi he
 Some researchers suggest that, because the DOTS system has been so successful in treating tuberculosis in sub-saharan Africa, DOTS should also be used in the treatment of diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and epilepsy
 dablyuechao ne 1998 main MDR-TB ke upachaar ke liye dots program kaa vistaar kiya 
 dots plus kaarykram ko lagu karne ke liye dots kii sabhi aavashyaktaaon ke alaava dawa samvedansheeltaa pareekshan kii kshamta or duusari pankti ke agents kii uplabdhta aavashyak he
 That is why dots are more expensive than plus dots and countries that want to implement this will have to be more committed to it
 sansaadhan ke simit hone kaa taatpary yah he ki dots-plus ko lagu karne se maujuuda dots program kii upeksha ho jaati he or iske parinamswaroop kul milakar dekhbhaal ke samgr maanakon kaa str gir jaataa he
 Monthly monitoring is maintained for dots-plus until the culture report changes to negative, but not for dots
 agar culture sakaaratmak he or upachaar ke teen maah baad rog ke lakshan phir se prakat nahin hote to dawa pratirodhi rog ke liye yaa kisi dawa ke kaam naa karne par rogi kii punah-jaanch aavashyak he
 If the culture does not turn negative after three months of therapy, some physicians recruit the patient so that his treatment process can be closely monitored
 vah tapedic jo phufphuson ko prabhavit nahin karata, atirikt-phuffusiya tapedic kehalaata he
 Disease of the central nervous system is not specifically included in this classification
 sanyukt raashtra or dablyuechao 2HREZ / 4HR kii salaah dete hai; sanyukt rajya america main 2HREZ / 7HR kii salaah di jaati he
 There is good evidence from a randomized controlled trial to say that in tuberculosis lymphadenitis and spinal tuberculosis, a six-month treatment is equivalent to a nine-month treatment period; Therefore the advice of the United States is not supported by the evidence
 lasicanodes ke tibi ke 25 pratishat maamalon main rogi ko upachaar die jane par sthiti behatar hone se pehle badtar ho jaati he or aisa aksar upachaar ke pehle kuch maheenon main hota he
 Only a few weeks after treatment is started, the lymph nodes increase in size and the lymph nodes that were previously solid begin to liquefy
 lekin isse aisa nahin kaha ja saktaa ki upachaar vifal ho rahaa he or yah aamtaur par rogiyon main anaavashyak dehshat bhi paidaa karata he
 With patience, the lymph nodes begin to contract again within two to three weeks of treatment, and at this time there is no need to re-biopsy or re-examine the lymph nodes: if microvascular studies are ordered again , The test will detect the presence of living bacteria with the same sensitivity pattern, which may again confuse: at this time, doctors who often have TB Areas are not experienced in treatment, often begin to assume second-line drugs, treatment is not effective
 in sthitiyon main, sirf aashwaasan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Steroids can be useful in reducing inflammation, especially when used in severe pain, but are not necessary
 atirikt antibiotic kii koi koi zarurat nahin hoti he or yah anaavashyak rup se upachaar kii lambaai ko badhaati he
 Tuberculosis can affect the central nervous system, brain and spinal cord), in these cases it is called TB meningitis, TB cerebritis, TB myelitis respectively; Medicines are given twelve months as its standard treatment and steroids are mandatory
 iskaa nidaan mushkil he kyonki aadhe se kam maamalon main hi siesuef culture sakaaratmak aata he or isiilie adhikansh maamalon kaa upachaar keval naidanik andeh ke aadhaar par hi kiya jaataa he
 PCR of CSF does not prove microbial yield; Culture is the most sensitive method and at least 5 ml of CSF is sent for analysis
 tibi cerabritis main nidaan ke liye mastishk kii biopsy kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he, kyonki siesuef aamtaur par saamaanya hota he: yah hameshaa uplabdh nahin hota he, kuch chikitsak ise jaays nahin tehraate hai, unka kahana he ki jab tibi-pratirodhi therapy kaa pareekshan bhi samaan parinaam de saktaa he to ek rogi ko itane aakraamak or khatarnaak prakriya se guzarane kii kya zarurat he; sambhavatya mastishk kii biopsy tabhi nyyochit he jab dawa pratirodhi tibi kaa andeh ho
 It is also possible that short-term therapy may be sufficient for the treatment of TB meningitis, but no clinical trials prove this
 tibi meninzitis kaa upachaar kiye jane ke baad bhi rogi kaa siesuef 12 maah tak asaamaanya rahata he; is asaamanyata kaa chikitsakeey pragati yaa parinaam se koi sambandh nahin hota, or yah is baat ko ingit nahin karata ki upachaar ko aage or badhaane kii yaa dohraane kii koi aavashyaktaa he; isliye upachaar kii pragati par nigaraanee rakhane ke liye lumber pankchar ke dwaara siesuef ke semple ko doharaaya nahin janaa chahie
 Although TB meningitis and TB cerebritis are classified together, the experience of many physicians is that the response to treatment is not the same
 TB meningitis usually responds well to treatment, but TB cerebritis may require longer treatment and a longer course of steroid course
 tibi mainingitis ke vipareet tibi cerabritis main pragati par nigaraanee rakhane ke liye baar mastishk kii siti yaa emarai imaging karne kii zarurat padati he
 CNS TB can be secondary to the spread of blood: therefore some experts recommend taking CSF samples regularly in patients with miliary TB
 tibi virdohi dawaaen jo sienes tibi ke upachaar ke liye sabase zyada upyogi hai, ve hai: Steroids are used regularly in TB meningitis
 a test has also shown that aspirin is also beneficial, but further work needs to be done before it can be used regularly
 tibi mainingitis or tibi pericarditis ke upachaar ke liye corticosteroid kii upyogita bhi pramanit ho chuki he
 For TB meningitis a dose of 8 to 12 mg of dexamethasone is given daily for more than 6 weeks
 For pericarditis, a 60 mg dose of prednisolone is given daily for four to eight weeks
 steroid phuffusavaranshoth, atyadhik bad chuke tibi or bacchon ke tibi main asthaayee laabh de sakati he
 Steroid peritonitis, miliary disease, laryngeal tuberculosis, lymphadenitis, and urinary masses It is not fully proven and regular use of steroids cannot be advised
 in rogiyon main steroid upachaar kaa upyog maamle par nirbhar karata he jiskaa faisla chikitsak ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Thalidomide may be beneficial in TB meningitis and has been used in cases in which the patient does not respond to steroid treatment
 jo rogi tibi kaa upachaar niyamit rup or bharose ke saath nahin karte hai, unamem upachaar kii vifaltaa ke sambhaavna bahut adhik bad jaati he, unamem rog ke phir se hone, yaa daawa pratirodhi tibi vibhed utpann ho jane kii sambhaavna bhi bahut adhik hoti he
 There are many reasons why patients are unable to complete their treatment
 Typically, the symptoms of TB begin to subside within a few weeks of treatment and at this time many patients become careless and stop taking medication
 iske puure upachaar ke liye nirantar dawa lenaa jaruri he, samay samay par yah jaanch bhi kii chahie ki rogi main koi samasya to utpann nahin ho rahi he
 It is important for patients to be told that they should take their medication regularly, that it is very important to complete the treatment, because by not doing so, the disease can recur and resistance to the drug can also occur
 isamen ek mukhya shikaayat yah rahati he ki isaki goliyaan bahut badi hoti hai
 The largest is PZA
 It can also be given as a PZA substitute, or if the pill size is actually too large and its syrup option is not available, then PZA can be completely removed
 agar pijede ko hataa diya jaataa he, to rogi ko yah chetavanee di jaani chahie ki isse rog ke thik hone kii avadhi bad sakati he 
 Another complaint remains that this medicine is advised to take an empty stomach until its absorption is fast
 yah rogiyon ke liye kai baar mushkil ho jaataa he or isliye rogi ko sirf dawa lene ke liye apni dincharya se ek ghanta jaldi jaagnaa padataa he
 These rules are not really as stringent as often stated by physicians: in fact, if RMP is taken with fat, its absorption rate is slow, but protein, carbohydrate and anti-acid absorption Do not affect isliye rogi aise bhojan ke saath dawa le saktaa he jisamen vasa yaa tel naa hon 
 bhojan ke dawa lene se matlee kii samasya nahin hoti, jo adhikansh rogiyon ko khaali pet dawa lene se hoti he
 The effect of food on the absorption of INH is not clear: sleep studies have shown that absorption decreases with food, whereas in one study no difference was known
 pijede or iembi ke avasorana par bhojan kaa prabhaav kam padataa he jo sambhavatya naidanik rup se mahatvapurn nahin he
 Urine tests can check the levels of isoniazid and rifampicin to determine if the drug is being taken properly

 neuropethy kaa kaaran aksar ienech hota he
 The peripheral neuropathy of INH is always a pure sensory neuropathy and the search for a causative component to peripheral neuropathy always stimulates the search for an alternative cause
 ek baar jab paridhiy neuropethy ho jaati he, ienech ko roak diya janaa chahie or din main teen baar roj pyridokasin kii 50 millilitre kii ek khuraaq di jaani chahiye
 neuropethy hone ke baad pyridokasin kii unchi khuraaq ko sirf dawa main shaamil kar dene se neuropethy kaa badhnaa rukegaa nahin

 Itching RMP usually causes itching in the first two weeks of treatment, but treatment should not be stopped, the patient is generally advised that the itching will be cured on its own
 Sedative antihistamines such as chlorpheniramine may be used to prevent itching
 upachaar ke dauraan kai kaarnon se bukhaar bhi ho saktaa he
 It can also occur as a natural effect of tuberculosis
 bukhaar kisi dawa ke liye pratirodh ke kaaran bhi ho saktaa he 
 bukhaar kisi or sankraman yaa kisi atirikt nidaan ke kaaran bhi ho saktaa he 
 kuch rogiyon main, bukhaar kisi dawa se allergy ke kaaran bhi ho saktaa he
 The doctor should also keep in mind the possibility that the diagnosis of TB is being made incorrect
 agar rogi ke upachaar ko do saptaah se zyada samay ho chukaa he or bukhaar shuru main chalaa gaya tha, phir se ho gaya he, to aisi sthiti main tibi ke sabhi dawaaon ko 72 ghante ke liye roak dena uchit he
 If the fever persists even after stopping all TB drugs, then the fever is not due to the medicines

 During the treatment of TB, hepatitis may increase abruptly, but it is rarely seen; In such a situation, emergency liver transplant has to be done otherwise the patient dies
 dawaaon ko phir se alag alag shuru kiya janaa chahie
 While doing this the patient should be monitored thoroughly, that is, he should be observed

 Medications should be given in this order
 ek din main ek se zyada pareekshan khuraaq nahin di jaani chahie or pareekshan khuraaq dene ke samay anya sabhi dawaaon ko roak dena chahie
 For example, on the fourth day, the patient is given only RMP, no other medication
 If the patient takes a 9-day test dose, it can be detected that PZA has caused hepatitis and PZA testing
 Dose is not required
 dawa ke pareekshan kaa upyog karne kaa kaaran yah he ki tibi kaa upachaar karne ke liye do mukhya dawaaen ienech or arempi hai, isliye inkaa pareekshan pehle kiya jaataa he: pijede ke kaaran hepatitis kii sambhaavna sabase adhik hoti he or yah ek aisi dawa bhi he jise aasaani se hataaya ja saktaa he

 Elderly patients who are already eating a large number of tablets may be given 9HR instead of PZA, which is larger size
 hameshaa shuruyaat se chaar dawaaon ke saath upachaar karnaa jaruri nahin hota he
 An example of this may be the close contact of a patient who has a completely sensitive differentiation of tuberculosis: in this case, the use of 2HRZ / 4HR is acceptable, in that it is expected that their differentiation is INH sensitive

 It is rarely seen that one variant of TB is rifampicin but at the same time not resistant to isoniazid, but intolerance to rifampicin is not common
 Among first-line drugs, rifampicin is also the most expensive and in poor countries, that is why rifampicin is often not used in treatment

 bahu - dawa pratirodhi tapedic, tibi kaa vah prakaar he jo kam se kam ai en ech or arempi ke liye pratirodhi he
 Isolates that increase resistance to any other combination of anti-tb drugs, but are not resistant to INH and RMP, are not classified as MDR-TB
 oktober 2006 ko di gayi paribhaasha ke anusaar, "bade paimaane par dawa pratirodhi tapedic" ko MDR-TB ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jo quinolon ke liye pratirodhi he or kenamicine, capriomycine yaa emicasin main se kisi ek liye pratirodhi he
 The old case definition of XDR-TB is MDR-TB, which is resistant to more than six classes of three or second-line drugs
 is paribhaasha kaa upyog ab nahin kiya janaa chahie, lekin yahaan ise isliye shaamil kiya gaya he kyonki kai puraane prakashan iskaa upyog karte hai
 There are similar principles for the treatment of both MDR-TB and XDR-TB
 mukhya antar yah he ki xdr-tibi main mrityu dar mdr-tibi kii tulana main adhik hoti he, kyonki isamen prabhavi upachaar ke vikalpon kii sankhya kam hoti he
 The epidemiology of XDR-TB is not currently well studied, but it is believed that XDR-TB is not easily transmitted in healthy populations, but may take the form of an epidemic in populations that have previously Since they are suffering from HIV, they are more likely to get TB infection
 1997 main 35 deshon main kiye gaye ek surveykshan ke anusaar surveykshan ke lagbhag ek tihaai deshon main isaki dar 2 pratishat se zyada thi
 Its highest rates were found in the former Soviet Union, the Baltic states, Argentina, India, and China, linked to poverty and the failure of national tuberculosis control programs

 MDR-TB can develop during the treatment of fully sensitive TB and is often due to the patient not taking any dose or completing treatment
 shukr he, MTR- tibi ke upbhed kam feet hai or inamen sancharan kii kshamta bhi kam hoti he
 It has been known for many years that INH resistant TB is less toxic in the guinea pig and epidemiology evidences that MDR strains of TB are not inherently more effective
 los angeles main kiye gaye ek adhyayan main mdr-tibi ke keval 6% maamle hi paae gaye
 This should not be a matter of satisfaction: it should be remembered that mortality due to MDR-TB is comparable to mortality due to pleural cancer

 XDR-TB is currently an epidemic for South Africa
 iske prakope kaa pataa tab chalaa jab kwazulu-netal main ek gramin aspataal main iske 53 rogi paae gaye jinamein se 52 kii mrityu ho gayi
 The main point of concern was that these patients died within just 16 days after sampling the sputum, whereas most of these patients had never undergone TB treatment before
 yah ek mahamari he jiske liye pehali baar sankshipt rup XDR-TB kaa upyog kiya gaya, haalanki tibi ke upbhed jo tibi ke vartmaan paribhaasha dete hai, kii pahchaan kar lee gayi he, yah ek duusare se sambandhit maamalon kaa ab tak kaa sabase bada samooh tha
 Since the initial report in September 2006, cases have now been reported in most provinces of South Africa
 16 march 2007, tak 314 maamle darj kiye ja chuke the, jinamein se 215 kii mrityu ho gayi
 It is clear that the spread of this strain of TB is related to inadequate control of HIV and infection; In other countries where strains of XDR-TB have arisen, resistance to the drug has developed due to not properly managing the case, or due to the patient not taking treatment properly
 tibi kaa yah upbhed pehali or duusari pankti ke liye, dakshin africa main vartmaan main uplabdh kisi bhi dawa ke liye pratikriya nahin detaa
 ab yah spasht he ki is samasya ko adhikariyon ke dwaara bataaye gaye samay se adhik samay ho chukaa he or yah usase kahin adhik vyapak he
 As of 23 November 2006, 303 cases of XDR-TB have been registered, of which 263 cases have been registered in kwazulu-natal
 tibi ke rogiyon ko alag rakhaa janaa ek gambhir vichaar he, kai logon ke anusaar yah rogi ke maanav adhikaron kaa ulanghan he, lekin tibi ke is upbhed ke aage prasar ko rokane ke liye yah aavashyak ho saktaa he
 The treatment and diagnosis of MDR-TB is more akin to cancer than to infection
 isamen mrityu dar 80 pratishat tak he, jo kai karkon par nirbhar karti he, in karkon main shaamil hai: The duration of treatment is at least 18 months and it takes a year to be even; It may also require surgery, although mortality is high despite optimal treatment
 us ne kaha, achche parinaam abhi bhi sambhav he
 Treatment is of a minimum duration of 18 months and the component of direct observation in it can increase the success of treatment by 69 percent
 mdr-tibi kaa ilaaj aise chikitsak se hi lenaa chahie jo mdr-tibi ke upachaar main anbhavi ho
 Mortality has been found to be higher in patients receiving treatment in non-specialist centers than in patients receiving treatment in specialist centers
 spasht jokhim ke alawa anya jokhim bhi dekhe jate hai jaise purush ling, echivi sankraman, pehle bhi tibi kaa ho chukaa hona, tibi kaa upachaar asafal hona, maanak tibi ke upachaar ke liye pratikriya na hona or tibi ke maanak upachaar ke baad rog kaa phir se ho janaa
 MDR-TB should be treated on the basis of sensitivity testing: treatment of such patients is impossible without this knowledge
 agar MDR -tibi ke sandigdh rogi kaa upachaar kiya ja rahaa he to rogi kaa upachaar prayogshaala samvedansheeltaa parikshan ke aadhaar par shrez+mxf+cychlocerin ke saath shuru kiya janaa chahie
 a gene test for rpob is available in some countries and serves as a useful marker for MDR-TB, as isolated RMP resistance is rare
 If results are positive, remove RMP and use SHEZ + MXF + cycloserine
 should go
 mdr-tibi ke andeh ke baavjood rogi ko INH par rakhane kaa kaaran yah he ki INH tibi ke upachaar main itani shaktishaalee he ki ise hataanaa murkhataa hogi jab tak is baat kaa sookshmjaivik pramaan na mil jaye ki yah aprabhavi he
 Investigations for isoniazid-resistance are also available, but they are not more widely available
 jab samvedansheeltaa gyaat ho jaati he or isolet ko nishchit rup se INH or RMP donon ke liye pratirodhi paaya jaataa he, paanch dawaaon ko nimnlikhit kram main chunaa janaa chahie : Drugs are placed at the top of the list because they are more effective and less toxic; Medications are placed at the bottom of the list because they are less effective and more toxic, or have difficulty obtaining them
 ek varg ke bheetar ek dawa ke liye pratirodh kaa arth he ki aamtaur par us varg main sabhi dawaaon ke liye pratirodh hota he, parantu rifampicin ek ullekhneey apwaad he: rifampicin ke liye pratirodh kaa taatpary hameshaa rifabutin se pratirodh nahin hota or prayogshaala main isaki jaanch ke liye kaha jaataa he
 It is possible to use only one drug in each class of medicine
 yadi upachaar ke liye paanch dawaaen dhundhna mushkil he to chikitsak is baat kaa anurodh kar saktaa he ki ucch stareey INH -pratirodh kii jaanch kii jaye
 agar upbhed main keval nimna str kaa INH -pratirodh he to INH kii unchi khuraaq kaa upyog upachaar ke ek hisse ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 With the continuation of drugs, the count of PZA and interferon decreases to zero; That is, by incorporating PZA with four drugs, you can select one drug to do five more
 ek se adhik injection vaali dawa kaa upyog karnaa sambhav nahin hota, kyonki in dawaaon kaa vishakt prabhaav thodaa bahut ho saktaa he: agar sambhav ho, aminoglaicosids pratidin kam se kam teen maheene ke liye di jaani chahie 
 ciprofloxasin kaa upyog tuberculosis ke upachaar main nahin kiya janaa chahie agar anya floroquinolon uplabdh ho
 There is no intermittent treatment for use in MDR-TB, but medical experience suggests that injecting drugs for five days a week does not produce bad results
 pratyaksh prekshit therapy nishchit rup se MDR -tibi ke parinaamon main sudhaar karne main madad karti he or ise MDR -tibi ke upachaar kaa ek abhinn hissaa mana janaa chahie
 Sputum culture can be performed repeatedly to detect how the treatment is reacting
 Treatment of MDR-TB should be given for at least 18 months and should not be stopped until the patient has Culture should not be negative for at least nine months
 It is not uncommon for patients with MDR-TB to be treated for two years or longer
 agar sambhav ho to mdr-tibi ke rogiyon ko ek nakaaratmak dabaav ke kamare main alag rakh dena chahiye

 Treatment of a patient is said to fail if he ve rogi jo upachaar main asafal rahete hai, unhen un rogiyon se alag man jaataa he, jinamein rog thik hone ke baad phir se ho jaataa he
 a patient is called relapse only when he or she recovers from treatment but relapses after relinquishing treatment, relapse is described in a separate section
 yah bahut hi asaamaanya he ki rogi upachaar ke liye pratikriya na kare, kyonki yah upachaar main sabhi dawaaon ke aadharbhoot pratirodh ko abhivyakt karata he
 Patients who do not respond at all to treatment should be questioned very closely about whether they are taking their medication properly and if necessary they should be admitted to hospital to observe their treatment
 tibi kii dawaaon kaa avasorana thik se ho rahaa he yaa nahin, isaki jaanch ke liye rakt yaa mutr ke namoonay liye ja sakate hai
 If they are taking the medicine properly and the medicine is also being absorbed, then there is a possibility that some other diagnosis should be made
 Diagnosis of these patients should be done very carefully and samples of TB culture and susceptibility tests should be studied thoroughly
 ve rogi pehle kuch bahetar ho jate hai, uske baad unki tabiyat phir se bigadane lagati he, unase upachaar ke anupaalan kii nigaraanee karne ke liye poochtacha kii jaani chahie
 If compliance is confirmed, they should be screened for resistant TB, even if they have already been sampled for microbiology before starting treatment

pratiraksha dosha pratikriya pradarshit naa karne kaa ek durlabh kaaran he
 In a small proportion of patients, treatment failure is a reflection of extreme biological variation and no cause is found
 rogiyon ke ek anupaat main, upachaar ke liye sabhi medical or shalya vikalp samaapt ho jate hai or jab aisi sthiti aati he, to rogi or uske parivaar ko suchit kar dena chahie ki rogi ke tibi ke kaaran mar jane kii sambhaavna he
 At such times the patient should be given psychological support, focusing on his nutritional needs and respiratory symptoms, so that his death is honorable
 ek rogi ko tab relaps kii shrenee nen rakhaa jaataa he jab vah upachaar karne par thik ho jaataa he lekin upachaar rokane ke baad phir se biimaar ho jaataa he
 Patients in whom there is a transient improvement in treatment, or who never respond to treatment are classified as failed treatments, as detailed above
 relaps kii dar kam hoti he jo upachaar se sambandhit hoti he, aisa tab bhi ho saktaa he jab rogi ne 100 pratishat anupaalan ke saath dawaaon ko thik prakaar se liya he
 Most of the time relapse occurs within 6 months after completion of treatment
 aksar un rogiyon main relaps kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he jo apni dawaaon ko aniyamit rup se lete hai
 The probability of resistance is higher in relapsing patients and all efforts should be made to take samples, so that they can be cultured to check for sensitivity
 adhikansh rogi jo puri tarah samvedi upbhed ke saath relaps karte hai unamem yah sambhav he ki aise rogi main relaps nahin hua hota, lekin iske bajaay unamem punah sankraman ho gaya hota he; aise rogiyon kaa upachaar pehle kii tarah saamaan dawaaon se kiya ja saktaa he
 
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan 2SHREZ / 6HRE se upachaar karne kii salaah detaa he, jab sookshmjaivik pramaan uplabdh naa ho 
 iis upachaar ko puri tarah se samvedansheel tibi ke ishtatam upachaar ke liye banaaya gaya he 
 saath hi yah NH -pratirodhi tibi kii sambhaavna ko bhi cover karata he
 Due to the risk of lifetime relapse, all patients are warned of the symptoms of relapse upon completion of treatment and are given strict instructions to go to the doctor immediately if they see any such symptoms
 jin kshetron main tibi atyadhik sthanikmaari vaala rog he, rogi ko bukhaar hona asaamaanya nahin he, lekin inamen sankraman kaa koi strot nahin paaya jaataa
 aisi sthiti main chikitsak jaanch ke baad sabhi bimariyon ko alag kar detaa he or tibi ke upachaar kaa pareekshan karata he
 This is treated with HEZ for at least three weeks; RMP and STM are eliminated from treatment because they are broad-spectrum antibiotics, while the other three first-line drugs only treat mycobacterial infection
 upachaar ke teen maah baad bhi bukhaar kaa bane rahanaa tibi kaa ek acha pramaan he or is samay rogi kaa tibi kaa paramparaagat upachaar shuru kar dena chahie
 If fever is not cured after three months of treatment, it may also happen that the patient's fever is due to some other reason
 yah drushtikon isaki aalochana ke bina he, isamen tark diya jaataa he ki aise sabhi rogiyon ko tibi kaa upachaar diya janaa chahie
 Surgery has played an important role in the management of tuberculosis since the 1940s
 tapedic ke liye pehla safal upachaar shalya chikitsa ke dwaara hi kiya gaya tha
 They were based on the observation that all cured tuberculosis had been filled
 isliye shalya chikitsa main upachaar ke liye khuli gufaaon ko bharne kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he
 All these procedures were used in the pre-antibiotic era
 isamen ek myth he ki shalya chikitsakon kaa maananaa he ki tibi ke jeev ko oxigen nahin pahunchane deni chahie: haalanki yah janaa mana tathy he ki yah jeev awaiviya paristhitiyon main jivit rahata he
 Although these procedures are considered barbaric by current standards, it should be remembered that these treatments are potential cures for the disease, as the mortality rate is at least as bad as in pleural cancer
 isamen neumothorex ko hameshaa thik kiya jaataa tha or is prakriya ko kuch saptaah ke baad baar baar doharaaya jaataa tha
 The diaphragm that had been paralyzed would then rise above it and its pleura would be destroyed, causing the cave to close
 chah se aath pasaliyon ko tod kar vaksh guha main dhakel diya jaataa tha taaki phuffus ke nichle hisse ko nasht kiya ja sake
 It was a barbaric surgery, but did not require the procedure to be repeated
 1940 or 1950 ke dashak main sankramit phuffus ko punah thik karnaa asanmbhav tha, kyonki us samay nishchetak vigyaan itnaa unnat nahin hua tha, jisase phuffus kii surgery karte samay use behosh kiya ja sake
 In modern times, tuberculosis surgery is limited to the management of TB resistant to many drugs
 mdr-tibi kaa rogi jiskaa culture kai maheene ke upachaar ke baad bhi sakaaratmak rahata he, usamen sankramit utak ko kaatane ke liye lobactomy yaa neumonnectomy kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Appropriate time for surgery is not determined and morbidity may persist even after surgery
 america main ek centre he jiske paas sabase zyada anubhav he
 The center is the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver, Colorado
 1983 se 2000 tak, inhone 172 rogiyon main 180 shalya chikitsaayen kin; inamen se 98 lobactomy thim or 82 neumonnectomy thim
 It recorded a 3
3% operative mortality rate; 6
8% died after the operation; Significant morbid conditions persisted in 12% of the 91 patients whose culture was positive before surgery, 4 of which came back positive even after surgery
 shalya chikitsa ke baad tapedic kaa upachaar karne ke baad bhi kuch jatiltaayen paayin gayin jaise baar baar hemopatysis, phuffus kaa nasht ho janaa yaa empiema 
 In TB of any organ other than pleural, surgery is often required for diagnosis: surgical sorting of lymph nodes, secretion of abscesses, tissue biopsy, etc
 are examples of this
 tibi culture ke liye liye gaye namoonon ko nirjarmikrut paatr main rakhkar prayogshaala bheja janaa chahie, dhyaan rakhana chahie kii isamen koi bahari padaarth naa mil jaye or jitna jaldi ho sake ise prayogshaala pahunchaa diya janaa chahie
 Where liquid culture facilities are available, the samples from the sterilized space should be dumped directly into the process space; This results in improvement
 merurajju ke tibi main, ridh kii haddi ke asthirataa ke liye shalya chikitsa kaa sanket diya jaataa he yaa jab merurajju ko khatara ho
 Regular screening of the secretion of TB collection is indicated and is helpful in appropriate treatment
 tibi mainingitis main, hydrosifelis ek sambhavi jatilta he or isamen ventricular ko daalane kii yaa srav ko band karne kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 It is a known fact that malnutrition is more likely to cause TB, TB itself is a risk factor for malnutrition, and TB patients with malnutrition are more likely to die, even if they are given appropriate antibiotic therapy

 Vitamin d deficiency is a risk factor for tuberculosis, and vitamin d deficiency impairs the physical ability to fight tuberculosis, but there is no medical evidence that preventing tuberculosis can prevent vitamin d deficiency Helps, although evidence should be available
 vitamin di kaa str kam hona africa americanyon main tapedic kii adhik sambhaavna ko spasht karata he, or yah is baat ko bhi spasht karata he ki lupas valgeris ke liye photo therapy kyon prabhavi he,, kyonki twachaa jab surya ke prakaash ke sampark main prakritik rup se aati he to isamen vitamin di kaa nirmaan hota he
 There is also an issue that tuberculosis treatment reduces vitamin d levels, but this is not a practical issue in medicine
 pashchim africa, gujarati or chini janata main vitamin di grahi main anuvanshik antar tapedic kii samvedansheeltaa ko prabhavit karata he, lekin kisi bhi aabaadi main aise koi aankade maujuud nahin hai jo jo ye darshaate hon ki vitamin di kaa poorak tibi kii samvedansheeltaa ko prabhavit karata he
 Giving vitamin d to the patients who are deficient in vitamin d is beneficial
 taqi vitamin di grahi ke tt jinapraroop vaale rogiyon ke upasamucchy main, jinamein vitamin di kii kami he, unhen vitamin di kaa poorak dene se jaldi hi thook ke culture main roopantaran hote hai
 Providing vitamin d supplementation to patients with normal vitamin d levels does not benefit from the perspective of TB
 19 veen sadi ke madhya main yah dekha gaya ki cod liver tel vah tapedic ke rogiyon ke liye phydemand hota he, or iske peeche tathy sambhavatya yah he ki yah tapedic ke liye pratiraksha tantra ko majboot banaata he
 Additional amounts of vitamin d potentiate the ability of monocytes and macrophages to destroy M
 tuberculosis in vitro, as well as reduce harmful effects on the human immune system
 sushupt tapedic ke sankraman kaa upachaar tibi ke niyantran or unmoolan ke liye aavashyak he, yah is jokhim ko kam karata he ki tibi kaa sankraman rog main badal jaye
 The terms "prevention therapy" and "chemoprophylaxis" have been used for centuries and are preferred in the United Nations because it claims patients with active symptoms of the disease and who are currently cured, Treatment is primarily done to prevent people from getting sick
 shabd "sushupt tapedic upachaar" ko sanyukt rajya america main praathamikta di jaati he kyonki daawa vastav main sankraman ko nahin rokatii: yah maujuuda shant sankraman ko sakriy hone se rokatii he
 In the United States, the term "treatment of LTBI" refers to people taking treatment for the disease
 ek shabd ke bajaay kisi duusare shabd ko praathamikta dene kaa koi kaaran nahin he
 It is important that active TB is tested before starting treatment for LTBI
 If a person with active TB is given LTBI treatment, it would be a serious mistake: it will not treat TB properly and will also increase the risk of developing drug-resistant strains of TB
 iske liye kai upachaar uplabdh hai: According to US guidelines, it should not be used in children and those who have radiographic evidence before TB

 By the 1980s, Unix became the most popular, powerful, and stable operating system, although by that time it had undergone several modifications
 unics main ek kami thi - isko samajhnaa tathaa chalaanaa mushkil he
 Andrew Tenenbaum is a professor of computer science at Amsterdam
 unhone isaki sahaayta ke liye minix naam kaa program likhaa
 It also had some shortcomings
 linus torwald finland ke helsinki vishvavidhyalay main kamputer vigyaan ke chaatr the
 He wrote a program to overcome the shortage of Minix which was later called 'unix of Linus' or Linux for short
 iskaa sabase pehla kor yaa karanal unhone 1991 main internet main post kiya
 By then Richard Stallman's 'GNU' project had started
 linus torwald ne isse bahut saare program apane linaks main liye
 Hence Richard Stallman says
 ki ise 'gnew-linaks' kahana chaiye
 But this name could not work because of its long standing
 par iskaa arth yah nahin hai ki linaks kii safalataa main gnew project kaa haath nahin he
 Linux was not possible without the GNU project

 Unix was first released in 1971, and was written entirely in assembly language, as was common practice at the time
 baad main, 1973 main ek pramukh agrani drushtikon main, ise denis richi dwaara kuch programing bhashaa main likhaa gaya tha 
 The availability of Unix's high-level language implementation made its porting to various computer platforms easy
 computer enterprise maamle main pravesh karne se pehle kisi antitrust maamle ke kaaran, anti and tii ko oparating system ke strot code ko kisi bhi vyakti ko license dene kii aavashyaktaa thi
 As a result, Unix grew quickly and was widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses
 1984 main, anti and tii ne bel labs ko khud ko vibhajit kar diya; ni: shulk licencing kii aavashyaktaa vaale kanoonee daayitv se mukt, bel labs ne unics ko malikana utpaada ke rup main bechnaa shuru kiya, jahaan upyogkartaaon ko kanoonee rup se unics ko sanshodhit karne kii anumati nahin thi
 The GNU project, started in 1983 by Richard Stolman, aimed to create a "complete Unix-compatible software system" made entirely of free software
 1 9 84 main kaam shuru hua
 Later, in 1985, Stallman started the Free Software Foundation and in 1989 wrote the GNU General Public License
 1990 ke dashak ke aarambh tak, ek oparating system main aavashyak kai kaarykram, text editors, unics shail, or ek windog system) puraa ho gaye the, haalanki divaais driver, damon or karnel, jinhen jienyu / hard kaha jaataa he, nimna str ke tatwon ko roak diya gaya tha or adhuraa tha
 Linus Torvalds has stated that if the GNU kernel was available at that time, he would not have decided to write his own
 miniks kaa nirmaan computer vigyaan ke professor andrew es tanembam ne kiya tha, or 1987 main chaatro or anya logon ko lakshith unics jaise oparating system ke rup main jari kiya gaya tha jo oparating system ke siddhanton ko siikhnaa chaahate the
 Although the entire source code of MINIX was freely available, licensing terms prevented it from being free software until licensing changed in April 2000
 linaks kaa koi bhi aphis nahin he, koi bhi company yaa vyakti iskaa maalik nahin he
 But programmers around the world contribute to it

 After that, Linus Torvald took the responsibility of managing the name LMI for the misuse of the Linux name
