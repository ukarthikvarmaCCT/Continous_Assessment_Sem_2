 70 homestead drive, new jersey 08068 sanyukt rajya america 70 Homestead Drive, Pemberton, NJ 08068 vararuchi katyayan panineey sutron ke prasiddh vaarthikkaar hai
 Varruchi has proved to be very important for Katyayan's palaeolithic grammatical grammar
 in vaartikon ke bina panineey vyakaran adhuraa sa rahaa jaataa
 Patanjali composed Mahabhashya from behind only on the basis of talks
 purushottamdev ne apane trikandshesh abhidhankosh main katyayan ke ye naam likhe hai - kaatya, punarvasu, medhajit or vararuchi
 The name "katya" is gotrapratyanta, he is mentioned in the Mahabhashya
 punarvasu naam nakshatra sambandhi he, "bhashaavriti' main punarvasu ko vararuchi kaa paryaay kaha gaya he
 There is no mention of Medhajit elsewhere
 iske atirikt, kathasaritsagar or brihatkthamanjari main katyayan vararuchi kaa ek naam 'shrutdhar' bhi aayaa he
 The name "varruchi" of Katyayan is also mentioned in Hemachandra and Medini dictionaries
 katyayan vararuchi ke vaarthik padhane par kuch tathy saamne aate hai-yadhyapi adhikansh sthalon par katyayan ne panineey sutron kaa anuvarthi hokar arth kiya he, tark vitark or aalochana karke sutron ke sangrakshan kii cheshtaa kii he, parantu kahin-kahin sutron main parivartan bhi kiya he or yada-kada panineey sutron main dosha dikhaakar unka pratishedh kiya he or jahaan tahaan katyayan ko parishisht bhi dene pade hai
 Probably the same Varruchi Katyayan has also composed Vedasarvanukramani and Pratyasakhya
 katyayan ke banaae kuch bhrajasanjyak shlokon kii charchaa bhi mahabhashya main kii gai he
 According to Kaiyat and Nagesh, Bhraja cogent Shloka is composed of the narrator
 praatishakhyam The narrator Katyayan Varruchi and Prakrit Prakashan Varruchi are two persons
 prakritprakashkar vararuchi "vaasavadatta' ke praneta subandhu ke mamaa hone se chhathi sadi ke harsh vikramaditya ke samasamyik the, jabaki panineey sutron ke vaarthikkaar isse bahut purv ho chuke the
 Varruchi is mentioned in Ashoka's inscription
 prakritprakashkar vararuchi kaa gotra bhi yadhyapi katyayan tha, isi ek aadhaar par vaarthikkaar or prakritprakashkar ek hi vyakti nahin maane ja sakate, kyonki ashok ke lekh kii praakrit vararuchi kii praakrit spasht hi naveen maaloom padati he
 As a result, Ashoka's predecessor Katyayana Varrukchi is the narrator and Ashoka's later Varruchi is the natural light
 madras se jo "chaturbhaani' prakashit hui he, usamen "ubhaysarika' naamak bhaan vararuchikrut nahin he, kyonki vaarthikkaar vararuchi "taddhitpriya' naam se prasiddh rahe hai or "ubhaysarika' main taddhiton ke prayog ati alp maatra main hai
 It is probably another person
 huyentsang ne buddhanirvana se praaia: 300 varsh baad hue palivaiyaakaran jis katyayan kii apane bhraman vrittant main charchaa kii he, vah katyayan bhi vaarthikkaar se bhinn vyakti he
 This Katyayana was a Buddhist master who composed the Buddhist scripture called "abhidharmagyanaprasthana"
 katyayayan naam kaa ek pradhan jain sthavar bhi hua he
 In the handwritten bibliography of the Aftect, the books composed of Varruchi and Katyayan are discussed

 Kashi is a very old city situated on the banks of the Ganges
 itane pracheen nagar sansar main bahut nahin hai
 Thousands of years ago, villagers of some short stature laid the foundation of this city
 tabhi yahan kapade or chaandi kaa vyapaar shuru hua
 After some time, the white people of high stature, who came from the west, took away their city
 ye bade ladaaku the, unke ghar-dwaar na the, na hi achal sampatti thi
 He used to call himself Arya i
e
 superior and great
 aaryon kii apni jatiyaan thim, apane kul gharaane the
 a royal house deposited in Kashi
 kaashi ke paas hi ayodhya main bhi tabhi unka rajkul basaa
 He was called the clan of King Ikshvaku, i
e
 Suryavansh
 kaashi main chandra vansh kii sthapana hui
 For hundreds of years, the Chandravanshi king of Bharat Rajkula ruled the city of Kashi
 kaashi tab aaryon ke purvi nagaron main se thi, purv main unke raaj kii seemaa
 The country beyond that was considered impure
 Chandravanshee King Jarasandha reigned in Magadha before Mahabharata and Kashi also merged into the same kingdom
 aaryon ke yahaan kanya ke vivaah swayamvar ke dwaara hote the
 In a swayamvara, Pandava and Kaurava's father Bhishma kidnapped the three daughters of Kashi Naresh, Amba, Ambika and Ambalika
 is apharan ke parinamswaroop kaashi or hastinapur kii shatruta ho gai
 In the Mahabharata war, both Jarasandha and his son Sahadeva were useful
 kalantar main ganga kii baadh ne pandavon kii rajdhani hastinapur ko dubaa diya, tab pandav vartmaan elahabaad jila main yamuna kinare kaushambi main nai rajdhani banaakar bas gaye
 His kingdom was called Vats and Kashi was now given the right of Vats instead of Magadha
 iske baad brahmadatt naam ke rajkul kaa kaashi par adhikaar hua
 There were great Pandit rulers in that clan and in the knowledge and Panditai reached the Kshatriyas from the Brahmins
 inke samakaleen punjab main kaikey rajkul main raja ashwapati tha
 At that time, in the Panchal who ruled the Ganges and Yamuna, King Pravin Jaibli also played the sting of his knowledge
 isi kaal main janakapur, mithila main videhon ke shaasha janak hue, jinke darbar main yajyavlky jaise gyani maharishi or gargi jaisi pandita naariyaan shastrarth karti thim
 His contemporary was the king of Kashi kingdom Ajatshatru
 ye aatma or paramatma ke gyaan main anupam tha
 There were then discussions in the country on the relation of Brahm and life, on birth and death, on the world-view
 in vichaaron ko upanishad kehete hai
 This period is also called Upanishad-period
 yug badalane ke saath hi vaishali or mithila ke lichhavi main sadhu vardhaman mahavir hue, kapilwastu ke shakya main gautam buddha hue
 In those days, the king of Kashi was Ashwaseen
 inke yahaan parswanath hue jo jain dharm ke 23wein tirthankar hue
 In those days, four states prevailed in India, who used to fight each other equally to win each other
 ye raahya the magadh, kosal, vatsa or ujjayini
 Sometimes Kashi passed into the hands of Vatsas, sometimes Magadha and sometimes Kosal
 parswanath ke baad or buddha se kuch pehle, kosal-shravasti ke raja kansa ne kaashi ko jitkar apane raaj main mila liya
 King Mahakoshal of the same clan then married his daughter Kosal Devi to King Bimbasar of Magadha as a dowry and started giving annual income of one lakh rupees per annum to Kashi and thus Kashi came under the control of Magadha
 raaj ke lobh se magadh ke raja bimbsar ke bete ajatshatru ne pita ko markar gaddi chin lee
 Then his brother Prasenjit, the brother of Kosal, saddened by the grief of the widowed sister Kosaladevi, stopped giving Kashi's income to Ajatshatru, which resulted in Magadha and Kosal Summer
 isamen kabhi kaashi kosal ke, kabhi magadh ke haath lagi
 Ultimately Ajatshatru won and Kashi merged into his growing empire
 baad main magadh kii rajdhani rajgrih se patliputra chali gai or phir kabhi kaashi par uskaa akraman nahin ho paaya
 The modern Kashi state has become the Bhumihar Brahmin state of Varanasi
 bhartiya swatantraaa uparaant anya sabhi rajavaadon ke samaan kaashi naresh ne bhi apni sabhi prashasnic shaktiyaan chhod kar maatr ek prasiddh hasti kii bhaanti rahaa aarambh kiya
 In the present case, it has remained only an honor degree
 kaashi naresh kaa ramnagar kila varanasi shahar ke purv main ganga nadi ke tat par bana he
 Another fort of Kashi Naresh is located at Chet Singh Mahal, Shivala Ghat, Varanasi
 yaheen maharaj chet singh jinaki maa raajput thi kko british adhikari ne 200 se adhik sainikon ke sang maar giraaya tha
 The Ramnagar Fort and its museum now remain a memorial to the kings of Banaras
 iske alaava 18veen shatabdi se ye kaashi naresh kaa aadhikarik awaas bana hua he
 Even today, the King of Kashi is seen with respect in the city
 ye shahar ke dharmik agrani rahe hai or bhagavan shiv ke avatar maane jate hai
 They are also considered to be the religious patrons of the city and form an integral part in all religious activities

 After this, on 15 October 1948, the state was merged with the Indian Union

 Aluminum is a chemical element found in metallization
 yah bhuparpati main sabase adhik maatra main pai jane vaali dhaatu he
 One major ore of aluminum is - Bauxite
 yah mukhya rup se aluminium oxaid, aayran aksaid tathaa kuch anya ashuddhiyon se milakar bana hota he
 These impurities are removed by the Bayer process, leaving only alumina
 alumina se vidyut apghaton dwaara shuddh aluminium praapt hota he
 Aluminum metal is the conductor of heat and heat and is very light
 iske kaaran iskaa upyog hawaii jahaaj ke purjon ko banane main kiya jaataa he
 In India, huge deposits of boxite are found in Jammu and Kashmir, Mumbai, Kolhapur, Jabalpur, Ranchi, Sonbhadra, Balaghat and Katni
 urisa sthit nalko duniya kii sabase sasti aluminium banane vaali company he
 Aluminum is a white colored metal
 latin bhashaa ke shabd aluman or angreji ke shabd ailam kaa arth fitkaree he
 The metal that could be separated from this alum was named aluminum
 fitkiri se to hamaara parichay bahut purana he
 Kankshi, Tuvari and Saurashtra are its old names
 fitkaree vastut: potacium salphet or aluminium salphet in donon kaa dvigun yogic he
 In 1754, Margraf demonstrated that the soil called alumina is different from lime
 sar hanferi davy ne san 1807 hi main alumia mitti se dhaatu pruthak karne kaa praytn kiya, parantu safalataa na mili
 In 1825, Arstad heated aluminum chloride with potassium content and then distilled the mercury
 aisa karne par jo churna sa batch rahaa usamen dhaatu kii chamak thi
 This metal is called aluminum
 san 1845 main frederick vohalar ne is dhaatu ke taiyaar karne main potacium dhaatu kaa prayog apchaayak ke rup main kiya
 He found some small particles of this metal, after examining which he told that this new metal is very light and its wires can be pulled
 tadnantar sodium or sodium aluminium chloride kaa prayog karke san 1854 main devil ne is dhaatu kii acchhee maatra taiyaar kii
 Being a new metal at that time, aluminum was counted among precious metals and was used in decorations and ornaments
 san 1886 main ohayo nagar main chalrs martin haul ne gale hue cryolite main alumina ghola or usamen se vidyudvishleshan vidhi dwaara aluminium dhaatu pruthak kii
 In the same year in Europe also, HERO independently made this metal in this way
 yahi haul-hero-vidhi aajkal is dhaatu ke utpaadan main vyavahrut ho rahi he
 Since it is lighter and cheaper, the prevalence of aluminum and alloys has been increasing since then
 aluminium dhaatu taiyaar karne ke liye do khanijon kaa vishesh upyog hota he
 One is bauxite and cryolite
 bauksite ke vistrut nikshep bharat main ranchi, palamu, jabalpur, balaghat, selem, belgaum, kolhapur, thana aadi jilon main paae gaye hai
 The permitted quantity of this mineral in this country is 28 million tonnes
 aluminium dhaatu taiyaar karne ke nirmitt pehla praytn yah kiya jaataa he ki bauksite se shuddh alumina mili
 a method of purification of bauxite is named after the Bayer method
 isamen bauksite ko garam castic soda ke vilyan ke saath abhikrut karke sodium aluminute bana lete hai
 This aluminate solution is filtered and the alumina is precipitated from it
 
 Aluminum metal from alumina is prepared by hall-hero method
 vidyudvishleshan ke liye jis cell kaa prayog kiya jaataa he vah ispaat kaa bana ek bada baksaa hota he, jiske bheetar carbon kaa astr laga rahata he
 This lining of carbon is prepared by heating a mixture of coke, pitch and coal tar
 isi prakaar carbon ke dhanagar bhi taiyaar kiye jate hai
 They are often 12–20 inches long rectangular
 ye dhanagar ek samvahak dand se latakate rahete hai or icchaanusaar upar neeche kiye ja sakate hai
 The electrolytes carry the dissolved cryolite inside the cell and the electromagnet controls such that the cryolite remains in an evenly damped state by the heat of its flow
 vidyudvishleshan hone par jo aluminium dhaatu banati he vah cryolite se baari hoti he, at: cell main neeche baith jaati he
 This metal acts as a minus
 gali hui dhaatu samay-samay par cell main se baahar baha lee jaati he
 Alumina is added in the cell as needed
 cryolite ke galnaank ko kam karne ke liye isamen bahudhaa thodaa sa calcium floride bhi mila dete hai
 It is notable that the success of an aluminum metal factory depends on cheap electricity

 Water does not affect the pure metal, but in the presence of copper, brass or other metals, the effect of water is also sufficient
 carbon athwa carbon ke oxide unche taap par dhaatu ko carbide main parinat kar dete hai
 In the presence of mercury and moisture, the metal becomes hydroxide
 yadi aluminium churna or sodium paraksaide ke mishran par pani kii kuch hi boonden paden, to jor kaa visphot hoga
 a mixture of aluminum powder and potassium permanganate gives intense light when burned
 dhaatu kaa churna garam karne par hellojan or nitrogen ke saath bhi jalane lagata he or aluminium hellide or nitrid banate hai
 This metal also reacts vigorously with bromine and iodine solutions made in dry ether to form bromide and iodide
 gandhak, selinium or telurium garam kiye jane par hi is dhaatu ke saath sanyukt hote hai
 Hydrochloric acid, when heated, reacts with the metal to form chloride
 yah kriya dhaatu kii shuddhta or amla kii sandratha par nirbhar he
 Dilute sulfuric acid has a gradual effect on the metal, but when increasing the concentration of acid, this effect first increases, but then begins to decrease
 98% salfurik amla kaa dhaatu par bahut hi kam prabhaav padataa he
 The effect of nitric acid on the metal is so low that the concentrated nitric acid can be sent in a container made of aluminum and sent far and wide
 ammonia kaa vilyan kam taap par to dhaatu par prabhaav nahin daalata, parantu garam karne par abhikriya tivrata se hoti he
 Caustic soda, caustic potash, and baryta have a strong effect on aluminum metal, but calcium hydroxide is not high
 aluminium oxijan ke prati adhik kriyasheel he
 Due to this property, this metal is used in the reduction of many oxides
 goldshmit kii thermite yaa taapan vidhi main aluminium churna kaa prayog karke louh, manganeez, chromium, malibdynum, tangston aadi dhaatuen apane oxidon main se pruthak kii jaati hai
 In 1926 AD, Bengf and Sutton devised a method by which a plate of oxides on aluminum metal is formed so that the metal beneath it is protected from corrosion
 yah kaary vidyuddhara kii sahaayta se kiya jaataa he
 Put the aluminum vessel in the solution of 3 percent chromic acid by making it rich
 voltata dhire-dhire 40 volt tak 15 minute ke bheetar badha di jaati he
 Let this voltage work for 35 minutes, then turn the voltage to 50 volts within 5 minutes and keep it stable for 5 minutes
 aisa karne par paatr par oxide kaa ek sookshm patal jam jaataa he
 Color or varnish can also be mounted on the vessel and can be given many colors as appropriate
 is vidhi ko anodiging yaa dhanagreekaran kehete hai or is vidhi dwaara banaae gaye sundar rangon se alankrita aluminium paatr bazaar main bahut bikne ko aate hai

 viki ke parivaar use or uske parivaar ko apane farmahouse par ek choti chuttee ke liye aamantrit karte hai
 Vicky's family becomes the very beginning of the dream
 prem or sapana bhi is samay ke dauraan pyaar main padate hai
 However before Prem can tell his family that he loves Sapna
 use pataa chalata he ki uski daadi viki kii sapana se shaadi karnaa chaahati hai or viki is prastaav par sahamat ho gaya he
 Prem does not want to break his brother's heart
 viki apni purv premika ke liye bahut lambey samay se dukhi rahaa he
 Prem no longer wants to get in her way
 vah sapana ko bataata he ki vah usko sirf bevakoof bana rahaa tha
 After breaking her heart, Sapna comes under pressure from her maternal uncle and uncle and agrees to marry Vicky
 haalanki, viki shaadi se pehle sachai jaan jaataa he
 Finally Sapna and Prem meet again
 ant main aisa darshaya jaataa he ki jab ek nai ladki uske karyaalay main shaamil ho jaati he to viki phir se pyaar main pad jaataa he

 barahavin putali padmavati ne jo katha sunai vah is prakaar he- ek din raat ke samay raja vikramaditya mahal kii chat par baithe the
 The weather was very pleasant
 punam kaa chaand apane yauvan par tha tathaa sab kuch itnaa saafe-saafe dikh rahaa tha, maanon din ho
 The kings were completely lost in the beauty of nature
 sahasaa ve chaunk gaye
 There was a scream of a woman
 cheekh kii disha kaa anumaan lagaaya
 Constantly a woman was screaming and calling for help
 us sree ko vipatti se chhutkaaraa dilaane ke liye vikram ne dhaal-talwaar sambhaali or astabal se ghoda nikaala
 Immediately, riding on a horse, went in that direction
 kuch hi samay baad ve us sthaan par pahunche
 They saw a woman running wildly saying "save the child" and a giant demon chasing her to catch her
 vikram ne ek kshan bhi nahin ganvaaya or ghode se kud pade
 The girl fell at his feet and begged to save him
 uski baahen pakadakar vikram ne use uthaaya or use bahan sambodhit karke dhants bandhaane kii koshish kii
 He said that he is the refuge of King Vikramaditya and no one can face him
 jab ve use dilasa de rahe the, to rakshas ne attahas lagaaya
 He told Vikram that an ordinary human like him cannot do anything to him and he will tear them apart like an animal in a few moments
 aisa bolte hue vah vikram kii ore lapka
 Vikram dared to warn him
 rakshas ne unki chetavanee kaa uphaas kiya
 He felt that he would crush Vikram in a moment
 vah unki ore badhata rahaa
 Vikram was also very careful
 vah jyonhi vikram ko pakadaney ke liye badha vikram ne apane ko bachaakar us par talwaar se waar kiya
 The demon was also very agile
 usne pintara badalakar khud ko bachaa liya or bhid gaya
 There was a fierce war between the two
 vikram ne itani furti or chaturaai se yuddh kiya ki rakshas thakaan se chur ho gaya tathaa shithil pad gaya
 Vikram took full advantage of the opportunity and stripped the head of the demon with his sword
 vikram ne samajha rakshas kaa ant ho chukaa he, magar duusare hi pal uskaa kataa sir phir apni jagah aa laga or rakshas dugune utsaah se uthakar ladane laga
 Apart from this, there was another problem
 jahaan uskaa rakt gira tha vahaan ek or rakshas paidaa ho gaya
 King Vikramaditya was amazed for a moment, but without getting distracted, he started facing both the demons simultaneously
 rakt se janme rakshas ne mauka dekhakar un par ghunse kaa prahaar kiya to unhone pintara badalakar pehle waar main uski bhujaayen tathaa duusare waar main uski taangen kaat daaleen
 The demon screamed so much with unbearable agony that the whole forest echoed
 use dard se tadapata dekhakar rakshas kaa dhairya jawaab de gaya or mauka paakar vah sar par pair rakhkar bhaaga
 Since he had shown his back, Vikram did not think it appropriate to kill him
 us rakshas ke bhaag jane ke baad vikram us sree ke paas aae to dekha ki vah bhay ke maare kaanp rahi he
 They told him that he should be restless and give up fear, because the demon has run away
 unhone use apane saath mahal chalane ko kaha taaki use uske maan-baap ke paas pahunchaa de
 The woman replied that the threat was not yet averted, because the demon did not die
 vah lautakar aayega or use dhundhakar phir isi sthaan par le aayega
 When Vikram wanted to know her introduction, she said that she is a resident of Sinhul Island and is the daughter of a Brahmin
 ek din vah talab main sakhiyon ke saath talab main naha rahi thi tabhi rakshas ne use dekh liya or mohit ho gaya
 From there he picked her up and brought her here and now asks her to accept him as her husband
 usne soch liya he ki apane praan de degi, magar apni pavitrataa nasht nahin hone degi
 She sobbed while speaking and her throat ached
 vikram ne use aashwaasan diya ki ve rakshas kaa vadh karke uski samasya kaa ant kar denge or unhone rakshas ke phir se jivit hone kaa raaj poocha
 The lady replied that a siren dwells in the stomach of the demon who puts nectar in her mouth as soon as she dies
 use to vah jivit kar sakati he, magar uske rakt se paidaa hone vaale duusare rakshas ko nahin, isliye vah doosraa rakshas aapng hokar dam tod rahaa he
 Hearing this, Vikram said that he vows that he will not return to his palace without killing that monster, no matter how long he has to wait
 unhone jab usase mohini ke bare main poocha to sree ne anbhigyata jataai
 Vikram began to rest below the shade of a tree
 tabhi ek singh jhaadiyon main se nikalakar vikram par jhapata
 Since Vikram was not completely alert, Singh went on wounding his arm
 ab vikram bhi puri tarah hamale ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 The second time when Singh lied towards him, he grabbed his feet and made him jump in the air with great force
 singh bahut dur jaakar gira or cruddh hokar usne garjana kii
 The second moment, Pal Singh took the form of a running demon
 ab vikram kii samaj main aa gaya ki usne chal se unhen haraana chaha tha
 He jumped and confronted the demon
 donon main phir bheeshan yuddh shuru ho gaya
 When the demon's breath started blooming while fighting, Vikram pushed the sword into his stomach
 rakshas dharti par girakar dard se cheekhney laga
 Vikram then tore his stomach with a sword
 pet fatate hi mohini kudakar baahar ai or amrit laane daudi
 Vikram remembered the hospitals and ordered them to capture Mohini
 amrit na mil paane ke kaaran rakshas tadapakar mar gaya
 Mohini told about herself that she was the courtesan of Shiva who had to become the servant of the demon as punishment for some mistake
 mahal lautakar vikram ne brahman kanya ko uske mata-pita ko soup diya or mohini se khud vidhiwat vivaah kar liya

 electrocardiography twachaa ke vidyut chaalkon se ek niyat samay ke liye hryday kii vaidyut gatividhi ko baahar se record kiye jane kii parvaksheeya vyakhya he
 This is a non-proliferative recording generated by an electrocardiographic device
 shabd kii vyutpatti, greek shabd electro, kyonki yah vaidyut gatividhi se sambandhit he, cardio, jiskaa greek bhashaa main arth hriday he, evam graph, ek greek mul kaa shabd jiskaa arth "likhnaa" hota he, se hui he
 The ECG works primarily by detecting and expanding subtle electrical changes on the skin at the time the heart muscle is depolarized during each heartbeat
 vishram kii sthiti main, hriday ke prayek mansapeshi koshika kii bahari diwaar, yaa koshika jhilli ke ek sire se duusare sire tak ek aavesh hota he
 Reducing this charge to zero is called depolarization that activates the mechanisms of the cell that cause it to shrink
 hryday kii prayek dhadkan ke dauraan ek swasth hriday main vidhruvikaran ke lahar kii suvyavasthit rup se krmanusaar vruddhi hoti he jo shiranal-alind parv kii koshikaon ke dwaara sakriy kar di jaati he, alind se hokar alag ho jaati he, "antasth chaalan path" se hokar guzarati he evam phir sampurna nilay main fail jaati he
 It is identified as a subtle fluctuation in the voltage of two electrical conductors placed in one part of the heart, which is displayed as a wavy line on a screen or paper
 yah pradarshan hriday kii mansapeshi ke vibhinn bhaagon main hriday kii samgr kamajoriyon ko darshata he
 More than 2 electrical drivers are commonly used and can be combined into multiple pairs
 , daayin bahu evam baayen taang vaale vidyut chaalak yugmon kaa nirmaan karte hai: ele+aare, ele+elel, aare+elel) prayek yugma se praapt output ko lead kaha jaataa he
 It is said that each lead looks at the heart from different perspectives
 vibhinn prakaar ke isiji ko record kiye gaye leedon kii sankhya ke dwaara suchit kiya ja saktaa he, udhaaharan ke liye 3-lead, 5-lead yaa 12-lead isiji

 3- and 5-lead ecgs have a tendency to be constantly monitored and screened to an appropriate monitoring device, for example during a surgery or while being transported in an ambulance
 Depending on the equipment used, 3- and 5-lead ecgs may or may not have a permanent record

 is gatividhi ko british sharirkriyavigyaani jon burdan sandersan ke dwaara lipman ke sookshm-vahika vidyutmapi kaa prayog karte hue pratyaksh rup se record kiya gaya
 Augustus Waller was the first person to discuss systematically the heart from an electrical point of view, working at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London
 unke vidyutahridlekh mashin main prakshepak main lipman kaa sookshm-vahika vidyutmapi laga hua tha
 The tracing of the heartbeat was projected into a photographic plate that was itself attached to a toy train

 ek praarambhik safalataa tab haath lagi jab liden, netherland main karyrat, wiliam eenthoven ne 1903 main avishkaar kiye gaye rajjunuma vidyutdharamapi kaa prayog kiya
 The device was more sensitive than both the micro-vessel electrometer used by Waller and the independent strand electromagnet invented in 1897 by French engineer Clement Eder
 
 aaj ke swayan chipakane vaale vidyut chaalkon kaa prayog karne kii bajaay eenthoven ke marij lavan ko ghol se bhare un paatro main apane angon ko daal dete the jisamen se isiji ko record kiya gaya tha
 Enthoven described various deflections with the letters P, Q, R, s and described the electrocardiographic characteristics of many heart and blood vessel disorders
 1924 main, unhen apni khoj ke liye chikitsashastra main nobel puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 Although the basic principles of that era are still being used, many progresses have been made in the scholastic history over the years
 udhaaharan ke liye, yantra vinyas bojhil prayogshaala upkaran se ek thos electronic vyavasthaaon main viksit hua he, jisamen aksar vidyatahridlekh kii computarikrut vyakhya shaamil hoti he
 The output of the ECG recorder is a graph in which time is displayed on the x-axis and voltage on the y-axis
 ek samarpit isiji mashin aam taur par graph paper par mudrit karegaa jisamen 1 mimi varg me kaa prishthbhumi pattern hota he, jisamen kshaitij evam urdhwadhar donon dishaao main prayek 5 mimi par spasht vibhaajan hote hai
 It is possible to change the output of most ECG devices, but it is standard to show each millivolt as 1 cm on the y axis and every second on the x-axis as 25 mm
 More rapid paper speeds can be used - for example - to determine more nuanced details in the ECG
 paper kii gati 25 mimi / second rakh kar, isiji kaagaj ke ek chote block ko kii gati main 40 milisecond main parivartit hota he
 Five small blocks combine to form one large block, which converts into 200 milliseconds
 isliye, pratisecond paanch bade block hai
 a calibration signal can be included to record simultaneously
 1 milivolt kaa maanak sanket shalaka ko urdhwadhar rup se 1 semi aage khiskaa saktaa he, jo isiji kaagaj par do bade varg hote hai
 a 12-lead ECG will, by definition, represent a small segment of each 12-lead recording
 It is often arranged in a grid consisting of 4 columns and three queues, with the first column being limb leads, the second column being augmented limb leads and the last two columns being chest leads
 aamtaur par is abhivinyas main parivartan karnaa sambhav he isliye yah dekhne ke liye labalon kii jaanch karnaa aavashyak he ki kis lead ko darshaya gaya he
 Typically each column will record the same moment in time for the three leads and then the recording will be moved to the next column which will record the heart beats after that point
 hriday ke taalon ke liye lead ke cholemon ke bich parivartit hona sambhav he
 Depending on the heart rate, each of these segments is small and it can be difficult to analyze any heart rhythms that indicate changes between heart beats
 vishleshan main madad karne ke liye ek yaa do "taal pattee" ko bhi mudrit karnaa aam baat he
 This will usually be Lead II and it indicates the rhythm for the entire time the ECG is recorded
 The term "rhythm bar" can refer to the entire printed record of a continuous inspection system that can represent only one lead and is either It is initiated by the doctor or it begins in response to a danger signal or event
 vidyutahridlekh main "lead" shabd bahut adhik bhram paidaa karata he kyonki iskaa prayog do bhinn baton ko suchit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 According to common language the term lead can be used to denote the electrical cable connecting the electrical conductors with the ECG recorder
 vaise to "baayin bahu vaale lead" ko vidyut chaalak ke rup main ullekh karnaa sweekaarya ho saktaa he jise baayin bahu ke nikat joda janaa chahie
 a standard "12-lead" ECG typically has ten electrical conductors
 vaikalpik rup se lead shabd do vidyut chaalkon ke bich voltata ke antar evam isiji recorder ke dwaara vaastavik rup se utpaadit baat kaa pataa lagane ko suchit kar saktaa he
 Each will have a unique name
 udhaaharan ke liye, "lead I" daayin bahu vaale vidyut chaalak evam baayin bahu vaale electrode ke bich voltata he, jabaki "lead II" daayen limb evam paad ke bich voltata he
 These types of leads form "12-lead" ecgs
 atirikt bhram paidaa karne ke liye aam taur par "limb lead" limb ke saath sanlagn vidyut chaalkon kii bajaay lead I, II evam III se praapt lekhachitreey record ko suchit karata he
 Shorter descent === Determination of electrical conductors === Ten power conductors are used for 12-lead ecgs
 aam taur par vidyut chaalkon main ek chaalak gel hota he, jo ek swayan chipakane vaale pad ke bich main ant:sthapit hota he jisamen cabel ko clip kiya jaataa he
 Sometimes gels also act as adhesive material
 unhen marij ke sharir main nimnaankit tareeke se label evam sthapit kiya jaataa he
 Classical 12-lead ecgs can be expanded in a number of ways as an attempt to improve its microbial ability to identify cardiac arrest, which includes areas that are not typically "seen" well
 Can

 In both 5- and 12-lead configurations, leads I, II and III are called limb leads

 limb lead un binduon kaa nirmaan karte hai jinhen eenthoven ke trikon ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 For example, simplified electromagnetic sensors designed for the purpose of teaching at the high school level are generally limited to three-arm power conductors that serve the same purpose
 lead do prakaar ke hote hai: ekadhruviya or dwidhruvi 
 dwidhruvi lead main ek dhanatmak evam ek rinatmak dhruv hota he
 In a 12-lead ECG, limb leads are bipolar leads
 ekadhruviya lead main bhi do dhruv hote hai, jaise ki voltata kii maap kii jaati he; haalanki, rin dhruv ek sanyukt dhruv jo kai anya vidyut chaalkon ke sanketon kaa bana hua hota he
 In a 12-lead ECG, all but the limb leads are unipolar
 wilson kaa kendriya terminal VW RA; LA; evam LL vidyut chaalkon ko ekasaath, ek saamaanya pratirodh kshamta vaale network ke madhyam se, vidyut chaalkon ko jodakar taiyaar kiya jaataa he jisase ki sampurna nikaay main ausat vibhav aropit kiya ja sake, jo anant main vibhav ke lagbhag hota he
 aavr, avl and avf leads are augmented leads
 unhen usee teen vidyut chaalkon se lead I, II evam III ke rup main liye gaye hai
 However, they view the heart from different angles because the negative power driver for these leads is the conversion of Wilson's central terminal
 yah rin vidyut chaalak ko prabhaavaheen kar detaa he or dhanatmak vidyut chaalkon ko "anveshak vidyut chaalak" banane detaa he
 This is possible because Enthoven's law says that i + + III = 0
 The equation can also be written i + III = II
 It is written as Einthoven completely changed the polarity of Lead II in Einthoven's triangle, perhaps because they wanted to look directly at the QRS assemblies
 wilson ke kendriya terminal ne sanvardhit limb lead avr, avl, avf evam purohrideey lead V1, V2, V3, V4, V5 evam V6 ke vikaas kaa maarg prashast kiya
 The augmented limb leads avr, avl, and avf are expanded in this way because the negative terminal conductor Wilson is not useful when the signal is too small to be centrally located
 lead I,II, evam III ke saath-saath, sanvardhit lead avr, avl, evam avf chah aksheeya sandarbh pranali kaa aadhaar taiyaar karte hai, jiskaa upyog agrapashchaj tal main hriday ke vaidyut aksh kii gananaa karne main kiya jaataa he
 The avr, avl, and avf leads can also be expressed using i and II limb leads: purohrideey lead ke liye vidyut chaalkon ko sidhe chaati par sthapit kiya jaataa he
 Due to their proximity to the heart, they do not require augmentation
 wilson ke kendriya terminal kaa prayog rinatmak vidyut chaalak ke liye kiya jaataa he or in leedon ko ekadhruviya mana jaataa he 
 purohrideey lead hriday kii vaidyut gatividhi ko tathakthith kshaitij tal main dekhte hai
 In the horizontal plane, the electrical axis of the heart is reported as the z axis

 The baseline voltage of the electrocardiography is called isoelectric line
 aam taur samavidyutvibhav rekha ko tii tarang ke parvarti evam agle pi tarang ke purvavarti anurekhan ke bhaag ke rup main mapa jaataa he
 Originally there were four deviations, but after the mathematical modification introduced by the initial amplifier, five deviations were discovered
 inthoven ne anurekhan kii pahchaan karne ke liye pi, kyuu, aar, es or tii aksharon ko chunaa jise asanshodhit labelayukt e, bi, si or di ke upar adhyaropit kiya gaya
 The interpretation of the ECG relies on the idea that different leads approach the heart from different "perspectives"
 iske do laabh hai
 First, lead showing the problem can be used to predict which region of the heart is affected
 duusare, vidhruvikaran ke tarang kii yatra kii samgr disha kaa bhi anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he jo anya samasyaon ko prakat kar sakate hai
 This is called cardiac axis
 hriday sambandhi aksh kaa nirdhaaran sadish kii avadharana par nirbhar karata he jo vidhruvikaran tarang kii gati kaa varnan karata he
 This vector can then be described in relation to the direction of the considered lead as its components
 ek ghatak lead kii disha main hoga he or ise kyuares samshti ke vyavhaar main prakat kiya jayega evam ek ghatak isse 90 degree par hoga 
 kyuares samshti kaa dhanatmak nival vikshepan yah suzav detaa he ki dhruvikaran kaa tarang hriday se hokar us disha main fail rahaa he jiske kuch ghatak lead kii hi disha main hote hai
 The electrical axis of the heart indicates the general direction of the depolarizing wavelet of the heart in the frontal plane
 ek swasth sanchaalan pranali ke dwaara hriday sambandhi aksh us bhaag se sambandhit hota he jahaan hriday ke mukhya manshapeshi kaa vishaal aakaar sthit hota he
 It is usually the left ventricle with some role of the right ventricle
 aamtaur par yah baanye pair kii disha main daanye kandhe main abhivinyast hota he, jo chah aksheeya sandarbh pranali ke baanye nimna chaturth bhaag ke sangat hota he, haalanki −30° se +90° ko saamaanya mana jaataa he
 If the left ventricle increases in its activity or larger size, it is called the "deviation of the left axis" because the axis quickly shifts to the left more than -30 °, optionally in situations where the right ventricle is strained or enlarged
 Is then the axis turns more than + 90 ° and it is said that "right axis deflection" exists
 hriday ke chaalan pranali ke vikaar mansapeshi ke vishaal aakaar main mahatvapurn parivartan darshaye bina vidyutiya aksh ko baadhit kar sakate hai
 In an adjustment with a right bundle branch block, the deviation of the right or left axis may indicate a bipolar block
 kul baarah lead hote hai, jinamein se prayek vibhinn drushtikon se hriday ke vidyutiya gatividhi kaa record karata he, jo gambhir hriddhamni sambandhi sthanik-araktata yaa chot kii pahchaan karne ke uddeshy se hriday ke vibhinn shaareerik kshetron ko paraspar sambandhit karata he
 The two leads that observe adjacent anatomical regions of the heart are contiguous
 Its relevance lies in determining whether abnormalities in the ECG may indicate true disease or false findings
