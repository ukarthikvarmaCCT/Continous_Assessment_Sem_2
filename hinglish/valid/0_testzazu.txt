 is granth kii bahut si samasyaon kaa ab tak sarvamaanya samaadhaan nahin hua he, phir bhi isai vyaakhyaata praaia: sahamat hai ki uttapatti pustak main nimnlikhit dharmik shiksha di jaati he- Although the creation style of the book of Genesis has a deep impression of the Sumeri- Babuli epic enma-eilish and Gilgamesh and its first author has used material before him which is believed to be Mesopotamia, the main religious teaching of the Utapati book is fundamental
 Is only us granth kii rachana par musa kaa prabhaav sabase mahatvapurn prathit hota he kintu uski mishrit style se spasht he ki musa ke baad parvarti paristhitiyon se prabhavit hokar anek lekhakon ne us pracheen saamagree ko nae dhaanche main dhaalane kaa praytn kiya he
 The present form of the text is probably of the eighth century BC
 Belongs to isaki vyakhya karne ke liye do tathyon ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie : The approach of the book of Genesis in the entire Bible is religious and not scientific
 rachayitaaon ne apane samay ko bhugolic tathaa vaigyanik dharanaon kaa sahaara lekar spasht karnaa chaha he ki ishwar hi vishwa tathaa uske samast praaniyon kaa srishtikartta he
 Therefore, it is useless to find the time of the beginning of the world or the development of the world according to science in that book
 utpatti pustak main praaia: pratikon tathaa rupakon kaa prayog hua he
 For example, to describe the origin of Adam, the Creator is presented as a potter
 us pratikatmak rachanastyli kaa dhyaan rakhe bina uski dharmik shiksha samajhnaa nitant asambhav he
 Therefore, it is only after following the ancient languages of the Middle East and their literary styles that the veil of symbols and metaphors of the book of Genesis can be removed and the form of religious education presented in it can be determined

 yolmo logon ko kar rahe hai ek swadeshi logon ke purvi himalay kshetrahai
 They refer to themselves as "yolmowa" or "hyolmopa", and live natively in the Helimbu and Melamchi valleys and surrounding areas of northeast Nepal
 The combined population of Yolmos in these areas is close to 10,000

 The Yolmo people speak belong to the sino-tibetan language family of the kyirong-kagate branch of the Yolmo language
 tadnusaar, yah ek ucch shabdic samanta ke liye tibeti, haalanki do bhashaaon main nahin kar rahe hai puri tarah se parsparik rup se sugam he
 They are traditionally known to wear chuba, which shares traditional Tibetan attire with their names and many stylistic cues
 However, a large number of the natives of Yolmos are Nepal, especially Tarkeghyang, Milimchim Gaon, Sermathang, Dhana, Sarkathali among others, preferring to wear tour-suruwal, the national dress of Nepal
 Yolmos may se chale gaye Gyirong ghaatiyon ke dakshin-pashchimi tibet ke bich 200 or 300 saal pehle
 ve bas kii ghaatiyon main helimbu, or dhire-dhire, intermarriages ke bich purush Yolmo lamaaon or tamang mahilaon ko sthaneey kshetra ke liye aam ban gaya
 In the 1980s, an increasing number of Yolmos began to identify themselves as Helmu Sherpa, even using the title as a surname to align themselves with the more prominent Sherpa people of the Solukhumbu District haalanki, yah naam abhi bhi prayog kiya jaataa karne ke liye sanderbhit karne ke liye Yolmo logon or unki bhashaa ke kuch udaahranon main, sahit ISO 639-3 bhashaa code, bahut kuch sadasyon ke Yolmo samudaay kii sambhaavna kii pahchaan ke rup main khud kii ek upadhara main sherpaon ke saath vartmaan samay or taarikh
 The Yolmos belonging to an ethnic group are the inhabitants of the original Yolmo from Kagate who stem from the Hellembu and Melamchi valleys
 What distinguishes them from others is that Kagate began migrating from the southeast to Helambu, and finally, to the Ramechhap district more than 100 years ago, and that they practiced craft paper making during their peregrinations in order to make a living - Earned the nickname "kagate"
 Some of the characteristics they have developed since are different from their speech in the traditional Yolmo
 The Yolmo speaking groups of Lamjung district and Ilam district were also historically called "kagate" although the two groups claim to have a clear distinction between themselves and Kagate's Ramechhap
 However, "yolmo" and "kagate" are frequently used words as both for the ethnic group and their dialect interchangeably

 Inevitably, Yolmo people are farmers
 Potatoes, radishes, and some other crops, along with their primary sustenance, flock to yaks from milk and meat to which Yolmos are known
 In the last few decades, the Helmbu region has also become a popular site for tourism and trekking, and many Yolmos are now employed in the tourism industry, as tour guides either in their own respective villages or in various other parts

 However, the number of monolingual Yolmo speakers is very low and there has been a gradual decline, as the number of only one language Nepalese Yolmos and English with bilingual Yolmos increases as their second language

 There are also a number of villages in Ilam district where Yolmo is spoken

 The Yolmo language is also spoken in important populations of Bhutan and Gyirong counties of western Tibet
 shabd "yolmo" yaa "hyolmo" ke hote hai do alag-alag shabd — Hyul, jiskaa arth he "ek jagah yaa kshetra main oonche pahaado se ghira hua he", or moka matlab he, jo "devi" kaa sanket he, ek jagah ke sangrakshan ke antargat ek mahila devtaa he
 For centuries, Tibetan Buddhists have referred to the Helambu region using the word "yolmo"
 In recent years, most people, like Yolmos and otherwise, seem to prefer the name "helmbu" itself
 yah he bhi aksar kaa daawa he ki naam "helimbu" se lee gai he Yolmo shabdon ke liye aalu or muuli 
 is vyutpatti he, haalanki, vivaadit he or aksar nakli mana jaataa he
 This interpretation of some refuters argues that "helambu" is an ambiguation word "yolmo" by speakers of phonetic contoured Nepali
 vahaan ek chal rahi charchaa ke bich Yolmo vidwaanon ke bare main kii vartanee "yolmo" main latin script he
 Some sides prefer "yolmo", while others prefer "hyolmo" or "yholmo" in which the letter "H" of appearance indicates that the first syllable word is spoken with a low, breathy tone
 It is worth noting that both Robert R
 Desjarlais and Graham E
 Clarke use "yolmo", while the Nepal Aadivasi Janajati Federation uses "hyolmo"

 The king began to rule according to Parikshit Dharma and according to the Brahmins

 By making Acharya Krupa a Guru, he performed three Ashwamedha Yagyas on the banks of Jahnavi
 un yagyon main anant dhan raashi brahmanon ko daan main di or digvijay hetu nikal gayi
 At the same time, Dharma made the form of a bull and met Gaurupini Earth on the Saraswati coast
 gaurupini prithvi kii netron se ashru bah rahe the or vah shrihin si prathit ho rahi thi
 Religion asked the Earth - "oh God! Why are you being mistaken? What are you worried about? Are you worrying about me, now that i am left with only one foot or you are talking about this?" Worried that now the Shudra will rule over you? " prithvi boli - "he dharm! tum sarvajna hokar bhi mujh se mere dukh kaa kaaran poochhate ho! satya, pavitrataa, kshamaa, dayaa, santosh, tyaag, sham, dam, tap, saralata, kshamta, shaastra vichaar, uparati, titiksha, gyaan, vairaygy, shaury, tej, aishwarya, bal, smriti, kaanti, kaushal, swatantrata, nirbhikta, komalta, dhairya, saahas, sheel, vinay, saubhaahgya, utsaah, gambheertha, kirti, aastikta, sthirataa, gaurav, ahankaarhinta aadi gunon se yukt bhagwaan shrikrishna ke swadham gaman ke kaaran ghor kaliyug mere upar aa gaya he

 Now my good luck has ended
 " While Dharma and Prithvi were talking about this, Kali Yuga came there as a crowned Shudra and started killing them both
 raja parakshit digvijay karte huye vahiin par se guzar rahe the
 They saw the crowned Shudra with a stick in his hand, beating a cow and a bull badly
 vah bail atyant sundar tha, uskaa shwet rang tha or keval ek pair tha
 The cow was also beautiful like Kamadhenu
 donon hi bhaybheet ho kar kaanp rahe the
 Maharaj Parikshit offered his bow and bowed in a solemn voice like a cloud - "O wicked! Sinner! Naradham! Who are you? Why are you torturing these innocent cows and bulls? You are a great criminal
" tere aparaadh kaa uchit dand tera vadh hi he
 "on hearing these words, Kali Yuga shivered with fear
 maharaj ne bail se poocha ki he bail tumhaare teen pair cas toote gayi hai
 You are a bull or a god
 he dhenuputr! tum nirbhiktapurvak apana apana vrutant mujhe bataao
 Hey Gaumata! Now you are free from fear
 main dushton ko dand detaa hoon
 Which evil has committed this stigma in the holy fame of the Pandavas by committing gross sins in my kingdom? Even if he is a sinful true God, i will cut off his hands too
 tab dharm bolaa - "he maharaj! aapane bhagwaan shrikrishna ke parambhakt pandavon ke kul main janm liya he atah ye vachan aap hi ke yogya hai
 Hey Rajan! We do not know who afflicts the creatures of the world

 Certain scholars consider nature and certain Gods to be the cause of sorrow
 atah he rajan! ab aap hi nishchit kijiye ki dukh kaa kaaran koun he
 " samraat parakshit us bail ke vachanon ko sun kar bole - "he vrishabh! aap avashya hi bail ke rup main dharm hai or yah gaurupini prithvi mata he
 You know the heart of religion very well

 o religion! Your tenacity, purity, mercy and truth were the four stages in the Satyuga
 treta main teen charan rah gayi, dwapar main do hi rah gayi or ab is dusht kaliyug ke kaaran aapkaa ek hi charan rah gaya he
 This unrighteous Kali Yuga is trying to destroy even that phase by its untruth

 " itnaa kah kar raja parikshith ne us paapi shudra rajveshadhari kaliyug ko maarane ke liye apni tikshn dhar vaali talwaar nikaali
 Kaliyug, fearful, took off his majestic dress and fell at the feet of King Parikshit and started saying tari-tahi
 raja parakshit bade sharnaagat vatsal the, unhone sharan main aaye huye kaliyug ko maarna uchit na samajha or kaliyug se kaha - "he kaliyug! tu mere sharan main aa gaya he isaliye maine tuje pranadan diya
 But only you are the root cause of wrongdoing, sin, lies, theft, treachery, poverty etc
 atah tu mere rajya se turant nikal ja or laut kar phir kabhi mat aana
 " raja parakshit ke in vachanon ko sun kar kaliyug ne kaatar vaani main kaha - "he rajan! aapkaa rajya to sampoorn prithvi par he, aapke rajya se baahar aisa koi bhi sthaan nahin he jahaan par ki main nivas kar sakun
 Hey Bhupathi! You are very kind, you have given me shelter
 ab dayaa karke mere nivas kaa bhi kuch na kuch prabandh aapako karnaa hi hoga
 " kaliyug is tarah kehane par raja parakshit soch main pad gayi
 After considering it, he said - "O Kali Yuga! Gaming, drinking, adultery and violence are inhabited by untruth, item, work and anger in these four places
 in chaar sthanon main nivas karne kii main tuje chhot detaa hoon
 "kali Yuga said this -" o Uttaranandan! These four places are insufficient for my residence
 dayaa karke koi or bhi sthaan mujhe dijiye
 "on asking for this kind of Kali Yuga, King Parikshit gave him the fifth place 'swarna'
 kaliyug in sthanon ke mil jane se pratyakshtah to vahaan se chalaa gaya kintu kuch dur jane ke baad adrushya rup main waapas aakar raja parakshit ke swarna mukut main nivas karne laga

 The son of that Shamik Rishi, Shringiu was very strong and was bathing in the river at that time
