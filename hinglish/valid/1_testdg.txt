 The background of the play is Pataliputra
 bharat ke anusaar das roopon main se yah 'mishra prakaran' kaa sarvottam nidarshan he
 The play 'mrithakkatikam' is a proof that India has inherited the tradition of giving the last man a place in literature where people like thieves, courtesans, poor Brahmins, handmaids, barbers, overthrow the evil king and establish a republic to establish heroism from the last man Are received

 With this, the political story of Aryak's statehood is also intertwined
 kritikar ne donon kathaon ko kushalta se joda he
 The play is broadly divided into two parts - first, the love affair of Vasantasena and Charudatta and the second, with the rebellion of Aryak attaining Rajpada
 pehla ank : is ank main yah katha he ki raja kaa saalaa shaakaar ujjayini kii prasiddh ganika vasantsena ko paanaa chahta he
 He pursues Vasantasena on a dark night with his two companions
 bhaybheet vasantsena charudatt ke ghar main shaaran leti he
 She leaves all her gold-clad as a heritage in Charudatta's house, telling her to escape the thieves
 doosraa ank : samvahak, jo pehle charudatt kii seva main tha, jue kii lat lagane par bahut sa dhan haar jaataa he
 He takes Sharan to the house of Vasantasena for rescue, who gives him a bracelet and makes him free
 vah buddha-bhikshu ban jaataa he
 Third issue: a Brahmin named Sharvilak loves Vasantasena's maid Madanika
 use daasatv se chhudaane ke liye vah ek raat charudatt ke ghar main send lagaakar vasantsena dwaara dharohar rakhe gaye sone ke saare aabhushan chura letaa he
 On the other hand, Chaudutt's paternal wife Dhuta gives her precious Ratnavali in exchange for stolen robes to save her husband from Loknanda, Chaudutt gives the Ratnavali and sends the clown Maitreya to Vasantasena's house
 chauthaa ank : sharvilak churaae hue aabhushan lekar madnika ko daasatv se mukt karaane ke liye vasantsena ke ghar pahunchataa he
 Madanika is very sad to hear about the theft
 is galati ko sudhaarney kii bhaavana se vah sharvilak ko yah samajhaati he ki chori ke aabhushan vasantsena ko saunp dene se na vah chor rahegaa, na charudatt ke sir par rin rahegaa or vasantsena ke aabhushan use vaapis mil jaayenge, sharvilak aisa hi karata he
 He tells Vasantasena that Charudatta has sent the message that we cannot keep the goldsmith safe by having a dilapidated house, so keep it with you
 vasantsena sandesh ke badale main kuch le jane kii baat kahkar madnika ko sharvilak ko saunp detii he
 In this issue, the clown meets Vasantasena and says that Swarnapatra has lost in gambling, so accept this Ratnavali
 vasantsena vaastaviktaa jaanati he, par kuch nahin karti
 She decides to come to Charudatta's house in the evening
 paanchavaan ank : is ank main varsha-ritu varnan hua he
 Vasantasena meets Charudatta and stays overnight at his house due to rain
 chatha ank : subah charudatt pushpkarndak udyaan main ghoomane jaataa he, vasantsena ke liye gaadi taiyaar rakhane kaa aadesh dekar taaki vah usamen udyaan tak yatra kar sake
 It is here that Vasantasena sees Chaudatta's son Rohsen insisting that he wants to play with a gold ball, not a clay car
 vasantsena saare aabhushan mitti kii gaadi main rakhkar kahati he ki isse sone kii gaadi bana lenaa
 Vasantasena comes out to meet Charudatta in the garden, but mistakenly sits in the car park standing at the same place
 udhar karagaar todakar, rakshak ko markar nikal bhaaga gwaale kaa betaa aryak, bachaav ke liye charudatt ke vaahan main chadh jaataa he
 On the way, two police soldiers - Veerak and Chandanak, also see the vehicle, but one of them lets Aryaak go by promising to protect him
 saatvaan ank : raja paalak ne sidhon kii bhavishyavaanee par vishwaas karke jis aryak naamak vyakti ko bandi bana liya tha, jab vah bandhan todakar bachataa hua charudatt kii gaadi main chadhakar udyaan main charudatt ke samaksh aata he or unase shaaran maangata he

 aathvaan ank : bhul se shaakaar kii gaadi main baithi vasantsena jab udyaan main pahunchati he to charudatt ke sthaan par dusht shaakaar se uskaa saamana hota he
 Vasantasena once again falls into the clutches of Shakara, on not accepting Shakkar's insistence, he strangles Vasantasena and leaves him covered with leaves knowing he is dead
 tabhi juaari se buddha-bhikshu ban chukaa samvahak mritpraaya vasantsena ko vihaar main laakar punerjeevan detaa he
 Number nine: Shakara makes Charudatta accused of killing Vasantasena
 nyaayalay main vivaad chalata he, charudatt swayan ko nirdosh sabit nahin kar paata
 Unhappy Charudatta waits for his friend Maitreya, who had gone to Vasantasena to return the jewelery that Vasantasena had given him to make a gold car instead of Rohsen's clay cart
 isi kshan vahi aabhushan lekar maitrey aa jaataa he
 But while negotiating with Maitreya, they fall in front of everyone, and it is believed that Chaudutt has killed Vasantasena in the greed of jewelery
 use mrityudand kaa aadesh dekar vadhasthal kii ore le jaaya jaataa he
 Tenth Issue: In this issue, one of the Shakara servants declares the perpetrator Charudatta innocent, but no one believes him
 duusare thik isi samay praan bachaane vaale buddha-bhikshu bane samvahak ke saath aakar vasantsena shaakaar kii dushtataa vyakt kar detii he or charudatt jhuthe aarope se mukt ho jaataa he
 Here the new king Aryak arrives in the kingdom, he not only gives the kingdom to the chargeless Charudatta, but also gives death penalty to Shakara due to false accusation

 On hearing the news of the death sentence for Pativrata Dhuta Charudatta gets ready to fire, Charudatta is present and stops this sad incident

 The play ends with these happy events
 mrichctic kii na keval kathavstu hi atyant rochak he, apitu kavi kii charitra chithran kii chaaturi bahut ucch koti kii he
 Though it has a predominant rasa vipralambha adornment, there is an easy harmony of the various juices of the heart like humor, compassion, terrible and vatsalya

 shabdachayan main maadhuri evam arthvyakti kii ore kavi ne savishesh dhyaan diya he, jisase aavanti evam vaidarbhi reeti kaa nirvaah purna rup se hua he
 There are two stories in Mrithaktik
 ek charudatt kii, duusari aryak kii
 The legend of Gunadhya tells the revolt of Gopal Darak Aryak
 brihatkatha apane mul rup main pashachi bhashaa main ‘baddkaha’ ke naam se likhi gai thi
 This shows that this play is of the first century AD or the second century AD
 yah naatak sanskrit sahitya main apana vishesh sthaan rakhata he
 in this- ye isaki visheshtaayen hai
 The political feature of this play is that it has been described as bad Kshatriya king
 gop-putr 'aryak' ek gwaala he, jise kavi raja banaata he
 Although the poet considers Varnashrama, he makes Gopa the king
 aisa lagata he ki yah moolkatha puraani he or sambhavtah yah ghatana koi vaastavik ghatana he jo kinvadanti main rah gai
 The depiction of slavery society is very beautiful and we find it in the time of Chanakya, when the word 'arya' is used as 'citizen'
 ho saktaa he, koi puraani kinvadanti chanakya ke baad ke samay main is katha main utar ai ho
 During the time of Buddha, the rise of traders was also considerable
 tab ujjayini kaa rajya alag tha, kosal kaa alag
 Ujjayini is also described here
 ek jagah lagata he ki us samay bhi bharat kii ekta kaa abhas tha, jab kaha gaya he ki 'sari prithvi aryak ne jeet lee' – vah prithvi jisaki kailas pataakaa he
 If seen, the poet was realistic and impartial
 usne sabaki achchhaayiyaan or buraaiyaan dikhaai hai or badi gaharaai se chithran kiya he
 This is the reason for his success
 yah maharaj shudrak kii kriti maani jaati he jo bhaas or kalidas kii bhaanti raaj kavi hue hai
 Mritchkatik AD can be said to be composed around the first century
 kaha jaataa he, bhasapranit 'charudutt' naamak chaturangi roopak kii kathavstu ko parivardhit kar kisi parvarti shudra kavi ke dwaara mrichctic kii rachana hui he
 In fact, the basis of its narrative is found in the stories narrated in Brihatkatha and Kathasaritsagara
 mrichctic’ kii katha kaa kendra he ujjayini
 He is such a big city that the conductor of Pataliputra comes to settle his fame and gain business after hearing his fame
 us samay vah patliputra ko mahanagar nahin kahata
 This means that Ujjayini was more important than Pataliputra at that time
 spasht hi patliputra buddha ke samay main patliputra tha, jabaki ujjayini main mahasen chand pradyot kaa samrudh rajya tha
 The second antiquity is that there is a lot of slavery in it
 das-daasi dhan dekar azaad kar liye jate the
 The courtesans also became brides in that society
 yah sab baaten aise samaaj kii hai, jahaan zyaada kadai nahin milti, jo baad main chaalu hui thi
 Rather, the poet has set a new ideal in the society by making the bride a bride
 usamen vidroh kii bhaavana he
 He kills the oppressor like an animal, elevates the woman and the slave frees the settler
 yon kah sakate hai ki yah naatak joki shastreey shabdon main prakaran he – bahut hi mahatvapurn he
 Who knows, how many social dramas were lost in the cheek of the times

 "for many years, Gandhi and his followers tried not to leave the Congress to the Muslims, and in the process, leaders of Hindu and Muslim hot parties irritated them

 He explained the reason for these divisions is that people from different communities cannot coexist

 Both of them were studying Quran at home
 umr unase kuran maangane lage magar unhone manaa kar diya

 magar unki bahan ne kaha ham mar jaaenge lekin islam nahin chodenge
 Omar felt ashamed to see the blood dripping from his sister's face and realized the mistake

 is najuk maukey par tabhi hazarat abu bakr ne musalamaanon ko ek khutaba arthath bhaashan diya jo bahut mashhoor he: Then read the verse of the Quran: hazarat abu bakr se sunakar tamaam log gash khaakar gir gayi, umr bhi apane ghutanon ke bal gir gayi tathaa is bahut baden du:kha ko sweekaar kar liya
 When Hazrat Abu Bakr felt that his time was near, he chose Hazrat Umar for the next Khalifa
 umr unki asaadhaaran ichha shakti, buddhi, raajnneetik, nishpakshta, nyaay or garibon or vanchiton logon ke liye dekhbhaal ke liye acchhee tarah se jane jate the
 Hazrat Abu Bakr was fully aware of Omar's power and his ability to succeed

 At one place, two women and men named Lalita and Lalit lived in a very luxurious house

 One day Gandharva was singing in Lalit's court that suddenly he remembered his wife
 isse uskaa swar, lay evam taal bigadne lage
 The serpent named Karkat recognized this error and conveyed it to the king
 raja ko lalit par bada krodh aayaa
 The king cursed Lalit to be a demon
 jab uski priytama lalita ko yah vrittant maaloom hua to use atyant khed hua
 The demon roamed the vagina for years
 uski patni bhi usee kaa anukaran karti rahi
 She was very sad to see her husband in this condition
 vah shringi rishi ke ashram main jaakar vineet bhav se prarthana karne lagi

 lalita ne muni kii ajna kaa paalan kiya or ekadshi kaa fal dete hi uskaa pati rakshas yoni se mukt hokar apane puraane swaroop ko praapt hua
 Then, while posing with Lalitha with many beautiful robes, both of them got to Swargalok sitting in the plane

 Description of an early modern type of maglev train R
 Polgreen's US patent 31,58,765, was made in the Magnetic System of Transportation
 sanyukt rajya america ke ek ekasv adhikaar main "meglev" kaa istemaal pehali baar canadian patents and deveopment limited dwaara "magnetic lavittesan gidence " main kiya gaya tha
 The term "maglev" refers not only to vehicles specifically designed for magnetic levitation and propulsion, but also to railway systems
 meglev praudyogiki ke sabhi sanchaalanaatmak karyanvayanon main pahiyedaar train praudyogiki ke saath nunatam adhivyapan he or paramparaagat rail trek ke anukool nahin hai
 Since they cannot share existing infrastructure, these maglev systems must be built as perfect transport systems
 applide lavittesan espm meglev system ispaat kii rail kii patariyon ke saath antar-sanchaalaneey he or yah meglev vaahanon or paaramparik trainon ko ek hi samay ek hi raste par chalane kii anumati detaa tha
 In Germany, MAN also built a maglev system that worked with traditional tracks but was never fully developed
 meglev praudyogiki ke vishesh rup se do ullekhneey prakaar hai: There is another experimental technology - a magnetic accelerator suspension, designed, proven mathematically, reviewed by colleagues and granted an authorization, but still not built, to lift the train and make it It uses the attractive magnetic force of a permanent magnet table near a steel track to establish it at its intended location
 pratikaarak sthaayee chumbak or atichaalak chumbak jaisi anya praudyogikiyon main kai anusandhan kiye gaye hai
 In existing electromagnetic suspension systems, the train rises on a steel track while the electromagnets attached to the train are tilted downward toward the track
 is pranali ko aam taur par si-aakaar vaali bhujaaon kii ek shrinkhalaa par vyavasthit kiya jaataa he or bhujaa kaa upree bhaag vaahan se sanlagn hota he or or nichalaa bhaag bhitari kinare main chumbak se sambaddh hota he
 The tracks lie between the upper and lower edges
 chumbakeey aakarshan duuri ke ghan ke saath badalata rahata he, isliye chumbakon or patari ke bich kii duuri main kiye gaye maamuli parivartanon kii vajah se bhi bahut zyada parivartaneey bal utpann hota he
 These changes in force are dynamically unstable - it can increase if there is even a slight deviation in the optimum position and complex systems of feedback control to maintain a train at an unchanging distance from the track)
 Is required
 nilambit meglev pranaaliyon kaa ek pramukh laabh yah he ki ve har tarah kii gati par kaam karti hai, jabaki vidyut gatibodhak pranaliyaan kam se kam lagbhag 30 kimi prati ghante kii gati par hi kaam karti hai
 This eliminates the need for a separate low-speed suspension system and as a result can simplify the track layout
 iskaa nakaaratmak paksh yah he ki is pranali kii gatyaatmak asthirataa ke liye trek kaa atishishnu jaruri he, jo is laabh ko ulat, yaa samaapt kar saktaa he
 As a result of the extreme confusion of this concept, Lathwaite was concerned that to build a track with the expected tolerance, the gap between the magnets and the rails would have to be increased to the point where the magnets would be improperly large
 vyavhaar main, is samasya ko pratipushti pranaaliyon ke vardhit pradarshan ke madhyam se sambodhit kiya jaataa tha, jo pranali ko gahan sahishnutaa ke saath chalane kii anumati pradaan karata he
 In electromagnetic suspension, both the track and the train exert a force on a magnetic field and the train is levitated due to the repulsive force between these magnetic fields
 yaa to vidyut chumbakon yaa sthaayee chumbakon kii ek sarani dwaara train main chumbakeey kshetra utpann hota he
 The repulsive force in the track is created by an induced magnetic field in the wires or by other conductors in the track
 pratikaarak meglev pranaaliyon kaa ek pramukh laabh yah he ki ye prakritik rup se sthir hote hai - trek or chumbakon ke bich kii duuri main maamuli sankuchan se bahut adhik bal utpann hota he jo chumbakon ko waapas unki mul sthiti main pahunchaa detaa he, jabaki duuri main ek halki si vruddhi bal ko kam kar detii he or ek baar phir vaahan sahi algaav main laut jaataa he
 No feedback control is necessary
 pratikarik pranaaliyon kaa ek pramukh nakaaratmak paksh bhi he
 At slow speeds, the induced current in these coils and the resulting magnetic flux is not high enough to support the weight of the train
 is vajah se uttolan ko banaae rakhane kii kshamta vaali gati tak pahunchane tak train ko sahaara dene ke liye train main pahiyon yaa kuch anya prakaar ke landing gear kaa hona bahut jaruri he
 Since the train, for example, can stop at any location due to equipment malfunction, the entire track must have the ability to support both low-speed and high-speed operation of the train
 iskaa ek or nakaaratmak paksh yah he ki pratikaarak pranaliyaan swaabhaavik rup se utthapak chumbakon ke saamne or peeche trek main ek aise kshetra kaa nirmaan karti hai jo chumbakon ke viruddh kaam karata he or ek tarah se khinchaav kii sthiti utpann karata he
 This is generally a concern for low-speed systems, in high-speed systems it does not take much time for this effect to dominate its overall capacity and other types of stretch
 karshan bal kaa istemaal vidyut gatibodhak pranali ke laabh ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, haalanki, kyonki yah patariyon main ek parivartaneey bal utpann karata he jiskaa istemaal train ko chalaane ke liye ek pratikriyaavaadi pranali ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he, jisamen alag se ek pratikriya plate kii jarurat nahin he, jaisaa ki adhikansh raikhik motor pranaaliyon main hota he
 Lathwaite led the development of systems such as "transit-flow" in his laboratory at Imperial College
 vaikalpik rup se, guideway ke pranodan coilon kaa istemaal train ke chumbakon par bal lagane ke liye or train ko aage kii taraf badhaane ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The propulsion coils exerting a train are effectively a linear motor: a variable current flowing through the coils creates a continuously variable magnetic field that moves forward along the track
 train kii gati kaa milan karne ke liye parivartansheel dhara kii aavriti kaa tulykaalan kiya jaataa he
 The backlash between the area formed by the force of the magnets in the train and the applied field produces a force that moves the train forward
 train kii tarah kii yatra ke liye chumbakeey uttolan siddhant ke prayek karyanvayan main laabh or nuksaan shaamil hai
 Vibration issues may arise due to the inherent instability of the system and the continuous improvement required by external systems
 na to indukatrack or na hi superkandacting idies main ek sthir vaahan ko uttolit karne kii kshamta hoti he, haalanki indukatrack ek bahut hi nimna gati ke liye uttolan pradaan karata he; in pranaaliyon ke liye pahiyon kii jarurat padati he
 EMS systems are wheel-less
 german transrapid, japani echesasti or korian rotem iemes meglev viramavastha main uttolit hote hai, jiske liye aavashyak bijli ko baad vaale do meglev ke liye bijli kii patariyon kaa istemaal karke or transrapid ke liye bina kisi taar kaa istemaal kiye guideway se praapt kiya jaataa he
 If the power of the guideway is lost in a dynamic state, using the power of the onboard batteries, the transrapid is still capable of generating levitation at a speed of 10 km / h
 lekin echesasti or rotem pranaaliyon ke saath aisa nahin hota he
 An EDS system can facilitate both levitation and propulsion using an onboard linear motor
 iemes pranaliyaan onboard chumbakon kaa istemaal karke train ko uttolit kar sakati hai, lekin ise aage kii taraf prerit nahin kar sakati hai
 Because vehicles require some other technologies for propulsion
 trek main sthapit ek raikhik motor is samasya kaa ek samaadhaan he
 a propeller or jet engine may be used in case of long distances with prohibitive cost of propulsion coils
 arnashow ke prameya se pataa chalata he ki sthir chumbakon kaa koi bhi sangyojan ek sthir santulan main nahin ho saktaa he
 However, various levitation systems perform stationary levitation in violation of the assumptions of Arnshaw's theorem
 arnashow kaa prameya maanata he ki chumbakon kii kshetra shakti sthitik evam aparivartansheel hoti he or yah bhi ki saapeksh pargamyata sthir hoti he or iskaa maan har jagah 1 se adhik hota he
 EMS systems rely on active electronic stabilization

 Kundakundacharya was the most famous Acharya of the Digambara Jain sect
 inkaa ek anya naam 'kaundakund' bhi tha
 a city called Kondkundpur of South India is also associated with his name
 professor e en upadhye ke anusaar inkaa samay pehali shatabdi i he parantu inke kaal ke bare main nishchayatmak rup se koi pramaan uplabdh nahin hota
 According to the inscription number 40 of Shravanabelagola, his initiation name was 'padmanandi' and he received divine knowledge from Seemandhar Swami
 acharya kundakund ne 11 varsh kii umr main digambar muni diksha dhaaran kii thi
 His initiation guru's name was Jinchandra
 ye jain dharm ke prakand vidwaan the
 The Samyasara, Niyamsara, Discourse, Ashtapahood, and Panchastikaya - Panch Paramagam texts are composed by him

 digambaron ke liye inke naam kaa shubh mahatva he or bhagwaan mahavir or gautam ganadhar ke baad pavitra stuti main teesraa sthaan he- Acharya Kundakund was the guru of Acharya Umaswamy, the creator of Tattvarthasutra

 Due to the effect of asceticism, he had many supernatural beliefs
 jain parampara main inkaa bade aadar se ullekh hota he
 At the beginning of the Shastra Sabha, along with Mangal Lord Veer, they are remembered as Mangal Kudkundadyo, which shows their importance in Jain rule
 inhone sarvapratham jain-aagam-sammat padaarthon kaa tarkpurna pratipaadan kiya he
 All his available texts are in Prakrit
 inaki visheshta rahi he ki inhone jain mat kaa swakaaleen darshanik vichaardhaara ke alok main pratipaadan kiya he, keval jain aagmon kaa pun:pravachan nahin kiya
 Representations of knowledge, philosophy and character are found in his various texts
 inhone ek ek vishay kaa nirupan karne ke liye swatantra granth likhe jinhen pahud kehete hai
 His mention of 84 Pahudas is found in Jainism
 inke mukhya granth nimnlikhit hai: He has given a new vision to Jain philosophy
 inako 'parasangrahavlambee abhedvaad' kaa pratipadak mana jaataa he
 Jaina Agamas are considered to have both distinction and impenetration in Dravya and synonyms
 parantu inke anusaar inkaa bhed vyaavhaarik he, parmarthat: donon abhinn he
 Similarly, both the harmony and the absence of the varna in the soul are inaccurate, but according to them, in practical terms the varna is in the soul and not in the spiritual form
 inhone deh or aatma ke aikya ko vyavahaarany main mana parantu nishchaynay main donon kaa bhed mana
 They consider matter as integral to power
 vaisheshik darshan main satta saamaanya ke kaaran dravya ko sat maanate hai, parantu unka kahana he ki is mat main to satta se bhinn hone ke kaaran dravya asat ho jayega
 Hence matter is the form of power and this is divine
 satta hi dravya, gun or padaarth ke rup main naanaa deshkal main viksit hoti he at: sab kuch dravya rup hi he
 Their intention was to consider virtue and synonym as impervious to matter and to accept both hospitality and truthism from discrimination
 parmaanu ke bare main inkaa kahana he ki sabhi skandhon kaa antim avyav parmaanu he
 It is eternal, wordless, indivisible and tangible
 parmaanu ko ras, gandh, varna or sparsh se yukt indriyagrahya parinami tatv kaha gaya or prithvi, jal, tej or vaayu kaa mul mana gaya
 In the Aupanishad and Mahayana philosophies, there is a distinction between behavior and altruism or genius and truth
 is bhed ko maanakar hi aadhyatmavaadi darshanik ek advaytatv kii pratishtha karte hai
 Jain philosophy is ghostly, not spiritualist
 phir bhi inhone vyavahaarany or nishchaynay main bhed mana
 What is generally seen is not always true, and there is no necessity that truth should always be visible in pure form
 unhone aatma ke teen rup maane
 Infatuated with external substances, the mind that considers the body as integral to itself is Bahiraatma
 deh kaa bhedagyaan ho jane par mokshamarg arudh aatma ko antaratma kaha gaya he
 When the soul is decayed by meditation, the soul attains pure form
 tab usko paramatma kehete hai
 He has declared this divine being completely integral to the then philosophy by calling Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu, Buddha etc
 which probably no Jain Acharya did
 yahi inaki visheshta he jo anya jainacharyon se inhen alag karti he or inaki samanvayvaadee pravriti kaa nidarshan he
 He considered the soul to be different from the work, but integrated it with the imagination of the man of the Sankhya, but did not consider the soul as infeasible
 unke mat main aatma anaatmak parinman kaa kartta nahin he kintu parinami hone ke kaaran usko kartta bhi mana he
 Spirit, knowledge etc
 is the doer of the subjective results
 unka kahana tha ki tatv kaa vyavhaar or nischaynyon se varnan ho hi nahin saktaa
 Element is positive
 jeev shuddh rup main ne to baddh he, na abaddh
 Only beings released from bondage and bondage have been called co-workers and divine divine beings
 vyavahaarany kaa niraakaran nishchaynay se hota he
 They say that though there is knowledge of the element by taking the shelter of the decision, yet after the philosophy is realized, the decision is also destroyed
 kisi dhaatu yaa mishradhatu se dhaale hue varnmaala ke aksharon ko 'tip' kehete hai
 The art of forming a group of types and printing them with ink is called printing art or type art
 chapai kii pramukh kala hone ke naate tip kala kaa avishkaar maanav ke sarvottam avishkaron main ullekhneey he
 The scholarship of scholars, the intelligence of the wise, the orders of leaders, the art of artists, all have made immortal by typography
 maanav ko vaigyanik, aarthik, raajnneetik tathaa saamaajik kshetron main pragati ke path par nirantar agrasar karanevaali yahi kala he
 Typical place among the various arts of printing is the second most

 Printing with type art, except for certain types of colored works, is also inexpensive
 atev tip kala kaa prayog pustakon, samachaarpatron patrikaon, lekhansaamagree, farm, dibbe, dibbiyaan ityadi chhapane main vyapak rup se hota he
 The utility of type art has increased tremendously due to the development of systems of making images by photography or mechanical methods and to compose types by instruments and to compose photo images

 In today's nuclear age, like other arts, type art is also progressive
 saarvajanik yantrikaran ke saath-saath anuyantron ne is kala par bhi apana aadhipaty sthapit kar liya he
 Nuclear powers are taking the place of handicrafts, but still the dominance of fine arts over type art will almost never be removed
