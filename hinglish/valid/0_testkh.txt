 islam main masjid ke liye keval sthaan vishesh hoti he magar iske vaastushilp par kadagan nahin
 Initially the mosque was constructed from the roof of pillars and addresses of the stems of Nabvi dates
 kaaba pattharon se bani ek chaukor imaarat thi jiske aasapaas khule parisar main puja hoti thi
 But over time, Muslims went to study resources and built mosques according to their needs and the culture of the region
 masjidon main mahange kaam or buland minar or gumbad baad main bananaa shuru hue
 The reason for the tower was that the mosque was visible from a distance, the azan di sound came on it and there was a glimpse of the culture and art of the area
 gumbad se masjid vaktaa ke bhaashan or prarthana kii awaz ek gunj or saundarya ke saath puri masjid main faili thi
 Since Islam does not encourage photographs of living things, the Quran import was used in various beautiful ways and various jewelery designs were also done for the mosque

 Some gunpots have mirrors that allow light to enter

 For centuries, mosques have been the hallmark of Quran imports and other sculptures
 kyonki islam jivit vastuon kii tasviren banane ke liye protsaahit nahin karata isliye masjidon kii araish anya maapdand istemaal kiye gaye
 Dark colors are used for sculpting in mosques, including feroze, dark blue, golden and red

 Several theories have been presented about the origin of Malayalam language
 ek mat yah he ki bhugolic kaarnon se kisi aadi dravid bhashaa se malayalam ek swatantra bhashaa ke rup main viksit hui
 The second view to the contrary is that Malayalam is a language derived from Tamil

 But Malayalam litterateurs have contributed significantly to Tamil and Sanskrit language development
 kerala ke kuch vidwaanon ne angrezi, kannada, tulu, konkani, hindi aadi bhashaaon main bhi rachana likhi hai
 The history of Malayalam literature is primarily the history of poetry till the last phase of the 19th century
 sahitya kii praarambhik dasha kaa parichay dene vaala kavy granth 'ramcharitam' he jise 13 veen shatabdi main likhaa gaya bataaya jaataa he
