 vayali lipyantaran tibeti lipi ke romaneekaran kii ek vidhi he jisamen un roman varnon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jo angreji bhashaa ke kisi saadhaaran tiperiter par bhi uplabdh hote hai
 The name is derived from the name of Turrell v Vayali, who introduced the scheme in 1959
 samay ke saath yah lipyantaran yojana ek maanak ban gayi 
 There is always a dilemma in all the schemes of romanization of the Tibetan language
 yah duvidha yah he ki romanikaran karte samay boli / kahi gayi tibeti bhashaa ke uccharan ko sangrakshit rakhane kii koshish kii jaay yaa tibeti lipi kii vartanee kaa anukaran kiya jaay
 The thing is that there is a lot of difference between written and spoken language in Tibetan
 vayali lipyantaran se pehle prachlit lipyantaran yojanaayen na to uccharan ko purnatah sangrakshit kar paatin thim na hi lipi kii vartanee ko
 The Vayali transliteration scheme does not follow the Tibetan pronunciation, but plans to introduce the Tibetan script into the Roman script
 vayali lipyantaran yojana main tibeti varnon ko nimnlikhit prakaar se badla jaataa he- In Tibetan scripts, a syllable within consonant clusters can be represented through the use of prefixed or suffixed letters or letters by letters to superscripted or subscripted root

 Four vowel marks are transliterated: jab ek akshar kaa koi spasht swar ankan, patr ek prayog kiya jaataa he kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye difolt swar "ek" 
 Many previous systems of Tibetan transliteration involve internal capitalization schemes — essentially, capitalizing the first letter of a word instead of the root letter, when the first letter is a prefix consonant
 tibeti shabdkoshon dwaara yojit kar rahe hai jad patr, or upsargon aksar chup hai, to jaanate hue bhi jad patr kaa ek behatar vichaar detaa he ke saath uccharan he
 However, these schemes are often implemented inconsistent, and usually only when the word is generally capitalized according to the norms of the Latin text

 The original plan of Wylie is not capable of transliteration of all Tibetan-scriptural texts
 In particular, it is the most Tibetan punctuation mark for any correspondence, and the lack of ability to represent the Tibetan script written in non-tibetan terms

 a standard developed for the University on the Tibet and Himalayan Library, the enhanced Wylie Tibetan System or EWTS, that lacks these addresses systematically
 It uses missing letters to represent letters and punctuation
 Many software systems, including TISE, now have a Latin keyboard on a type unrestricted Tibetan script to allow them to use this standard

 In modern times the term ecology was first used by Ernest Hackel in 1866 and he tried to define it as something like "economics of nature"
 Human ecology is the discipline that inquires into the patterns and process of interaction of humans with their environments
 Human values, wealth, life-styles, resource use, and waste, etc
 must affect and be affected by the physical and biotic environments along urban-rural gradients
 The nature of these interactions is a legitimate ecological research topic and one of increasing importance

except for those women are valid, provided that you do not want to be spoiled and live, but if you want to change your goods from the poverty of Iftan or Pakdamini
 If you have exchanged with women, then give them what you have done and after getting married, if you agree with each other then you There is nothing wrong, of course, God is the one who recognizes the problems and problems, and those of you who do not love to be free to marry women with free will, then they can marry your momina laundries who are in your possession and God
 It is very well known with your faith that you have each other's friends and marry the laundries with the permission of their owners and they are happy Do give but marry those from desi behavior that keep you punctual with Ifrft neither If you want to live openly and do not want to secretly cheat, then when you are banned, then if someone commits fraud, then the punishment given to the free wives will be given to half the laundries
 If you are afraid of being done and have patience, then it is better for you to be right and God is the best kind of God
 Make a statement and go on the ways of those who have passed before you and accept your experience and God is really fair and willing and God wants you to accept and those who are behind the Nafsian wish Want you guys to go too far and God wants to thrill you because man has been born very weak
 Do taken a second to eat goods unjustly but you merchandise from the mutual Rjhamndi If you do not give your life to your throat, you are sure to be kind to your condition, and if the person who does this is a victim of Zoroam, then we will soon throw him in the fire of the world
 If you continue to avoid Kabira, then we will go through your sins and will give you a place of great respect and God One of them is preferred over the other, do not lust for men, men are part of their actions and women are part of their actions and this is the other thing that you wish for your happiness and deeds with God
 Father and the strongman, the person who leaves the way, we have declared the heir of each one and you give the share of the people to whom you have done it
 Women are witness to everything, because women have controlled women
 Has given hawk to the men and since the men have spent their goods on the women, they do not care for women, but the way they protect their back, they also protect them and the women who dislike being protected If you are unaware, first explain to them and you leave gold with them and kill them, but not so much that there is no blood and no pity if it becomes your dead If you do not find the way to their harm, then God is definitely the oldest and if you are obsessed with the whole nightmare of Mia Biwi, then one of the men of one year and another in the clan of a woman If you want to reconcile these two years, God will make a good arrangement between them and God is sure and alert and God himself Mr
 worship do and do not make any part of it and Maॅ father and Khrabtdaron and orphans and Do favors with loved ones and neighbors and strangers and strangers who sit in the side and the neighbors and the necessary laundries and slaves
 Of course, these are the ones who do not keep friends with the swagger and the ranters
 We also give orders to Bukhal and hide the goods which God has given to them from their fazal and we have refused For those who have prepared a great deal of resentment and those who spend their goods just to show people, they do not believe in God nor do they believe in themselves, because their partner is Satan
 And whose partner is the devil, then what a bad partner if these people believed in God and the end of the day and spent everything in the heavens from what God has given them Programming what is coming calamity on them and Allah is with them well acquainted Allah certainly shred Equally does not even persecute, but if someone who is equal is of any kind, then he is doubled, and on his own side, he is able to make a big difference, what will happen when we summon witnesses of every gang and witness you on them all? Those people who summoned the day on the day and will respect the disobedience of Rasul, that i wish and the land would be made equal over them and sorry these people themselves You will not be able to hide anything from that day, o believers, you do not go close to the namaz in the state of intoxication so that whatever you say to the mouth, you may not even feel angry in the state of zenabat but the path is in the pass If you are a patient and waste water or are on a trip, if any of you come out of the store or have sex with women and you do not have water, then swim on the baking soil and remember your mouth and hands
 Fist full of hands, of course God is sorry You did not look at the condition of those people who were given some part of the book god, they started buying the missing person, their wish is that you too get away from the road and God is very well aware of your enemies and just for friendship It is enough and for the sake of advocacy itself, there are also some people from Judah who manipulate their palace and opportunity in things and twist their tongues
 By the way of Tanazani on Kar and Din, Samayana and Asaina and Wasam Gaira Musmine Raana take care of me and say my shepherd and if he had said instead of Samayana and Atana and Isamah and Unzurna, it would have been much better and more straightforward for him
 It was a matter, but they are fit for God because of their pimples, except a few people and people will not believe in this book, which we have revealed and It also ratified the truth that you have Iman on the Lao But Khbl that Let us spoil the faces of some people and turn them towards their ancestry or as we have done the same on al-sabah Sabbath, as well as the alimony and consider it a work ordered by God, but God does not forgive the crime that was charged with him
 If you go to the crime which you want to forgive and who made you a god, then did you see the storm of big crime
 Not that you become a big lawsuit, but God creates a lawsuit that anyone wants and that the victim is not like a thread on anyone, just see how these people add lies to God, and this is enough for open crime Haven't you noticed those who were given some part of the book god and started reading the scourge of Satan and idols and Friend has said his wish, that this is way more than those who bring honor phir kuch log to is par imaan laae or kuch logon ne usase inkaar kiya or isaki sazaa ke liye jahannum kii dahakati huyi aag kaafii he ki jin logon ne hamaari aayaton se inkaar kiya unhen zarur ankareeb jahannum kii aag main jhonk denge jal jaaengi to ham unke liye duusari khaalen badal kar paidaa kare denge taaki vah acchhee tarah azaab kaa mazaa chakhen beshak khuda harchiiz par gaalib or hikmat vaala he or jo log imaan laae or achche achche kaam kiye ham unako ankareeb hi aise aise baagon main ja pahuchaayenge jin ke neeche naharen jari hongi or unamem hameshaa rahenge vahaan unki saafe suthri bivia hongi or unhe ghani chhav main le jaakar rakhenge i eemaandaaron khuda tumhen hukum detaa he ki logon kii amaanatein amaanat rakhane waalon ke hawaale kar do or jab logon ke bahmi jhagadon kaa faisla karne lago to insaaf se faisla karo isaki kya hi acchhee naseehat karata he isamen to shaq nahin ki khuda sabaki sunata he dekhtaa he i eemaandaaron khuda kii itaat karo or rasul kii or jo tumme se sahebane hukumat hon unki itaat karo or agar tum kisi baat main jhagada karo pas agar tum khuda or roze akhirat par imaan rakhte ho to is amr main khuda or rasul kii taraf ruju karo yahi tumhaare haq main behatar he or anjaam kii raah se bahut acha he kya tumne un logon kii par nazar nahin kii jo ye kyaali pulao pakaate hai ki jo kitaab tujh par nazil kii gayi or jo kitaaben tum se pehle nazil kii gayi laae or dili tamanna ye he ki sarakashon ko apana haakim banaae haalaaki unako hukum diya gaya ki uski baat na maane or shaitan to yah chahta he ki unhen bahaka ke bahut dur le jaae or jab unase kaha jaataa he ki khuda ne jo kitaab nazil kii he uski taraf or rasul kii taraf ruju karo to tum munaafiqin ko dekhte ho ki tumse kis tarah muh pher lete hai ki jab unpar unke karatuut kii vajah se koi musiibat padati he to kyonkar tumhaare paas khuda kii qasamen khate hai ki hamaara matlab neki or mail milaap ke sivaa kuch na tha ye vah log hai ki kuch khuda hi unke dil kii haalat koob jaanata he pas tum unase darguzar karo or unako naseehat karo or unase unke dil main asar karne vaali baat kaho or hamane koi rasul nahin bheja magar is vaaste ki khuda ke hukum se log uski itaat karen or jab un logon ne apni jaanon par julm kiya tha agar tumhaare paas chale aate or khuda se maafi maagate or rasul bhi unki magafirat chaahate to beshak vah log khuda ko bada tauba qubul karne vaala meharbaan pate i swear by your family, these people will not be true believers, to make you their ruler in your quarrels, then do not be disheartened in whatever way you decide, but gladly accept it and if we become like Israel, then you will rule them
 You would have issued that if you kill yourself or the city becomes bad, then these people, except a few men, would not have done it and if these people had acted Areas that have them are advised to be very good in their favor and are very proven frozen send-off, and in this case we also definitely nice change from your side or unako raahe raast kii bhi zarur hidaayat karte or jis shshaks ne khuda or rasul kii itaat kii to aise log un bandon ke saath honge jinhen khuda ne apni nrrmaten di hai yani ambia or siddiqin or shohada or saalehin or ye log kya hi achche rafiq hai It is a fuzz for God and God is just i eemanvaalon apni hifaazat ke acchhee tarah dekhbhaal lo phir tumhen ikhteyaar he khwaah dasta dasta niklo yaa sabake sab ikatthe hokar nikal khadey ho or tumme se baaj aise bhi hai jo zarur peeche rahenge phir agar ittefaaqan tumpar koi musiibat aa padi to kehane lage khuda ne hampar bada fazal kiya ki unamem ke saath maujuud na hua or agar tumpar khuda ne fazal kiya to is tarah ajanabi banake ki goyaa tumme usamen kabhi mohabbat hi na thi you kehane laga ki i kaash unke saath hota to main bhi badi kamyaabi hasil karata pas jo log duniya kii zindagi akherat ke vaaste de daalane ko maujuud hai unako khuda kii raah main jehad karnaa chahie or jisane khuda kii raah main jehad kiya phir shahid hua to goyaa gaalib aayaa to ham to ankareeb hi usko bada ajr ata farmaayenge tumko kya ho gaya he ki khuda kii raah main un kamazor or bebas mardo or auraton or bacchon ke vaaste jehad nahin karte jo khuda se duaae magha rahe hai ki i hamaare paalane vaale kisi tarah is basti se jiske baashinde bade zaalim hai hamen nikaal or apni taraf se kisi ko hamaara sarparast bana or tu khud hi kisi ko apni taraf se hamaara madadgaar bana eemanvaale to khuda kii raah main ladate hai or kuffaar shaitan kii raah main ladate marate hai pas tum shaitan ke hawa kaahon se lado or kyanki shaitan kaa daao to bahut hi boda he kya tumne un logon par nazar nahin kii jinako or unako hukum diya gaya tha ki apane haath roke raho or paabandi se namaaz padho or zakaat die jaao magar jab jihad unamem se kuch log logon se is tarah darane lage jaise koi khuda se dare balki usase kahin zyaada or kehane lage kudaaya tuune hampar jehad kyon vaazib kar diya hamako kuch dinon kii or mohalat kyon na di unase kah do ki duniya kii asaaish bahut thodaa sa he or jo darataa he uski akherat usase kahin behatar he or vahaan to resha baraabar bhi tum logon par julm nahin kiya jayega tum chaahe jaha ho maut to tumko le daalegi agarache tum kaise hi majboot pakke gumbadon main ja chhupo or unako agar koi bhalaai pahuchati he to kehane lagate hai ki ye khuda kii taraf se he or agar unako koi takaleef pahuchati he to kehane lagate hai ki ye tumhaari badaulat he tum kah do ki sab khuda kii taraf se he pas un logon ko kya ho gaya he ki koi baat hi nahin samajhate haalaaki jab tumko koi faaydaa pahuche to khuda kii taraf se he or jab tumko koi faaydaa pahuche to khud tumhaari badaulat he or hamane tumko logon ke paas pigambar banaakar bheja he or khuda kii gavaahi kaafii he jisane rasul kii itaat kii to usne khuda kii itaat kii or jisane rugaradaani kii to tum kuch khyaal na karo hamane tum ko pasbaan karke to bheja nahin he to kah dete hai ki ham faramabardaar hai lekin jab tumhaare paas se baahar nikle to unamem se kuch log jo kuch tumse kah chuke the uske kilaaf raaton ko mashwara karte hai haalaaki ye log raaton ko jo kuch bhi mashwara karte hai use khuda likhata jaataa he paas tum un logon kii kuch parvaah na karo or khuda par bharosa rakho or khuda karsaji ke liye kaafii he to kya ye log quran main bhi gaur nahin karte or agar khuda ke sivaa kisi or kii taraf se hota to zarur usamen bada ikhtelaaf pate or jab unke paas aman yaa khoff kii khabar aayi to use foran mashhoor kar dete hai haalaaki agar vah uski khabar ko rasul or eemaandaaro main se jo sahabane hukumat tak pahuchaate to beshak jo log unamem se uski tahaqiq karne vaale hai usko samaj lete ki or agar tumpar khuda kaa fazal or uski meharbaani na hoti to chand aadamiyon ke sivaa tum sabake sab shaitan kii pairvi karne lagate Love yourself, jihad in the way of God and you are not responsible for anyone other than your world, and give faith to the believers, and will stop the fate of the near-unbelievers and God is the highest and the punishment is very strong, which is good work
 If he recommends, he too will get some share of the good work and if he recommends the bad work, he will also get some share of the punishment for that work and God himself Everything is sacrificed and when a person salutes you, you should salute him in a better way than in response to it or say the same words in the answer
 Of course God is the one to account for everything; He will gather you on the Day of Judgment, in which there is no doubt, and who will be more truthful than God, then what has happened to you that you are profitable? About gone two Frikh Halaॅki himself God by virtue of their deeds their Do you want to reverse the wisdom of the people, that you want to leave the person who has been left in a tomb, although God has left the person in the tomb, for which no person can find a way out of those people
 The wish is that the way he has become a Kafir, you too may be a Kafir so that you become equal to him
 Unless he hides in the path of God, then give one of them Do not make a stole, then if they turn away from that, then arrest them and get them murdered wherever you are and do not make any of them your friend or helpers, but those who go through such a law that you and they have a lot of respect and dignity Or have come to you in a heart-wrenching way to fight you or fight with your demons, and if God wanted to make you feel bad, he would definitely have to fight you if he wanted to kill you Interpretation of war and to you not fight and you Akbar near Sulah then you God has not given any strength to reach a thousand people, but you will find some other people who want you to live in peace and stay in peace with your demise whenever you are called for quarrel
 If the force does not fall, they do not take any edge from you and do not give you the message of reconciliation nor stop your hands from fighting
 Hold them and get them where they are killed and this is the people Notwithstanding, we have given you a real mistake and it is not right for an honest person to kill a Momin, but by deceit and the person who kills a Momin by deceiving, then freeing an honest slave and killing the perpetrators of Maktool But when those people forgive, then if the maktool is among those who are your enemies and they themselves are murderers, then liberating a Muslim slave and And Mkhtul be those that you have been the Ahd and scales Warise To kill a maktool and to liberate a dead Momin, then if not found, then the person has a loft for two consecutive months from God, and God is a very wise person and a person who willfully kill a Momin is punished
 Dozak and he will always be in it, God has raised and cursed him and has prepared a very tough job for him
 If you travel in the way, then check well and if the person salutes you, you should not think that you are not honest that you have the desire of worldly hope but by killing this excuse and rob it and not Understand that there are many prizes here for God, at first you were like this yourself, then God has done you a favor, investigate the poverty well, of course God is good for everything you do The seating at the hidden Muॅh of jihad except Majhur people of God Those who do jihad with their lives and goods in the path cannot be equal, those who have done jihad with their life and property, but God has given great relief from the status of God, God has promised good to all the honest
 However, due to Azeem Sawab's objection to the food of the Ghazis, God has given great blessings on his behalf
 No, of course, the people whose occupation, the spirit angel, has said that they were oppressing their lives, and after the occupation spirit, they say with surprise that you were in misfortune, then they say that we were innocent in the soil
 The angels say that there was not so much scope in God's land that you would walk away without knowing that the whereabouts of such people is inhuman and that is a bad hideout, but the men and women and children are Helpless to ensure neither can Kai contrivance and see a way for their release Hopefully, God is so forgiving and spared by such people, and if the person who hides in the path of God, then he will be able to get many ruins in the ruined land and the person who lives in his home If God comes out of God and his Rasul, then death comes before reaching him, then God has lost his glory and God is very happy Mr
 and you are afraid of the good that the Kuffaar will love you, then there is no chance for you to do anything in the prayer; of course, the Kuffaar is your absolute enemy and you are present in the Muslims and that you start teaching them the Namaz Leave one to fight, one of them should pray with you and take his or her prayers with you, when you decorate
 Be sheltering Pusht behind you and the other congregation who until prayer is found in reading and Read the Namaz with you and the kufar, who is carrying the things of his protection and his weapons, wants to make a mistake with his weapons and his accessories and belongings, so once everyone falls on you, there is no chance in that
 If you get some trouble due to rain or if you are ill, then take off your weapon and keep protecting yourself and God has given it to the infidels
 You have prepared the wonders of prayer, then when you have finished praying, then remember to sit down while you wake up, then when you get ready, then pray according to prayer, because the prayer is forbidden by worshiping the time on the honest and pursuing enemies
 Do not be lazy in doing it, if it hurts you in the fight, then the same trouble you get, they also get the same surprise and this is also you You have friends who are not destined, and God is the only one who knows you This book has been revealed by the reason that God has instructed you in the same way, decide between people and do not be a part of those who take care of you, and ask for blessings of God, of course, God is a very spontaneous kindness and do not fight against you To betray on your own, of course, God does not keep friends with such a person who is a betrayer, he hides his mischief from people and although It is also with them at that time that those people spend the night discussing things that God does not agree with and God is surrounded by all his misdeeds
 Be aware that in the life of the world, you stand to fight against them
 Then, on the day of Judgment, who will fight with God by being his side or who will be his lawyer and the person who does some bad deed or persecutes his nafs, then after that his own anger Need to pray Maॅge then will God smiled a big Bkhshne and that person no crime If he does something then he does his own harm and God is a very good man and if the person does any account or crime, then imposes on him the head of an innocent person, then he imposes a big and veritable crime on himself and if God is on you If Fazal and he were not obliged, one of those gangs would surely mislead you, although those people are just misleading themselves and these people do not need you You can reach and God has revealed your book and wisdom to you and taught you things which you did not know and you have a great sense of God, but there is often no good in the words of his secret, but the person who can give someone a chance Or do good deeds or order to reconcile among the people and if a person does such work in the desire of happiness of God, then we will unknowingly revenge him very well
 Ata will form and the person who walks through Rasul after revelation of Rahe Rasta And if we go on any other way than the way of Mominin, where he has gone again, we will also turn around and throw him in the world and he himself is a very bad destination
 Of course, he does not want to be made another part of it
 Except for the crime which is spared and who has made someone to participate in God, he has just gone too far to go astray, except Mushrekin Khuda, only he tries for women
 i have women, these people try to curse the evil devil whom God has cursed and who said that i will definitely take some of your people and then they will definitely mislead them and will also give them great hopes and of course i will teach them, then they will rip the work of animals and i will tell them, just then they must change the condition created by God
 Area and that made his mentor the devil than God, he blatantly Strict losses incurred Satan makes good promises to them and also gives hope and whatever promises Satan makes to them is simply a complete deception
 These are the people whose whereabouts are just where they are and they will not find any place to escape from and who will People accepted the faith and did good things, we will soon be able to go to the gardens under which the canals will be released and these people will always be there It is a sure promise of God, and who will be more truthful than God, nothing can be gained from the resplendence of your book or the desire of the first book, but the evil that will be done will be avenged and no one but God If you will find your guardian and not helpful, and the person who will do good work, be it a man or a woman and be honest, then such people will go into unconsciousness and even mole will not be oppressed
 Who would be better in a deen than a man who bowed down his entire show in front of God Diya and Neko also own a car and follow the manner of Ibrahim, who used to be stunned by the null and God has made Ibrahim his best friend and whatever is in the hope and whatever is in the land is God himself and himself Everything is surrounded by nature, these people make a fatwa about marriage to you, you tell them that God allows you from them, and the command that forbids you in the Quran It has been taken for the sake of those orphan girls whom you do not give them the right to be mauled, and you want to marry them and make orders about those weak children {weak} and it is you Stay on justice about justice and whatever you do rightly, then you are sure and if a woman is afraid of her husband's excesses and betrayal There is no crime both in the way of consorting Mia Biwi and Reconciliation is better and more than ever, we are aspects of almost every health and if you do goodness and be carefree, then you are aware of everything you do, and if you want so much, then you are not able to do so much that in many of your wives, justice Do it even if you do not want to leave the hanging so that if you reconcile and remain alive then God is sure to be a very happy and if both If wife gets divorced from each other, God will destroy both of them with her own treasure and God is a person with a lot of guilt and affection and whatever is in the hope and what is in the land is God and the people who The books have been set before you and you have also bequeathed them to be afraid and if you have done anything wrong then whatever is in the hopes and whatever is the zam God is in God and God is the most disrespectful and wicked person Whatever is in anticipation and whatever is in the ground is special and it is enough for the work itself
 If people want to do it themselves, then you should pick it up completely and bring others and God, then it is to be taken away and the person changed
 If you want in the world, God has both the end of the world and the end, and God listens to every person and sees everyone, that the believers should stay firmly with justice
 Give testimony for God, if you are not against yourself or your parents or bosses, if you are rich or have a lot of love, then you do not plead to the willing nurse in clipping and if you turn around you will give testimony or absolutely If you deny what you do, you are very well aware of the faith of God and His Messenger and His book, which He has written But the Nazis and the book that they brought to the belief of the Nazis and the person who is God And when his angels and his books and his rasulas and fasts were confined, he wandered away from the path, of course, those who believed then became infidels, then believed, and then after that they became infidels and grow in the kuffa If left, God will not pity them, nor will they instruct them on the way, give the good news to the profiteers that it is definitely painful for them that people Except they make the kafirs their patron, do they have respect for their dignity? All honor is special only for themselves, though God has revealed this command in you in his book Quran that when you hear that there is a denial from the verses of God Is done and he is being pranked, so you don't sit with them even if they start looking into some other thing or else you are equal to them at that time Will it be in doubt hell not only that God all Munafikhon and infidels Will deposit that which is your wish, then if you were beaten by God, then you started saying that if we were not with you and if the part got to the infidels, then did we say that we did not come wrong on you and we did not save you from the relationship On the Day of Judgment, God will decide between you and God has not given any way to the Kafirs to stay high on Mominin
 Do not deceive God, although God himself deceives them, and when these people stand to offer prayers, they stand with glee and only show people and remember God something like this from their heart
 You are not swinging in the midst of Iman, neither towards them nor towards those Kafirs, and you can leave them in the guile of whatever you are, let alone the believers
 Make no backer to Hkr infidels is that you want the God of the clear allegation Do not doubt your head, there is no doubt that the profits will be at the bottom of the world and you will not find anyone to support them there, but the people who have relieved and settled their condition and are clinging to God If you have made the deen just as good for God, then these people will be with Mominin, and Mominin itself will be a big revenge if you thank God and If you believe in God, what will you do by surprise you, but God is good and true, God does not like to say bad by calling, but he knows that if he does good and hears good or hide or from someone's evil If you do so, then God is also a very good worshiper
 Of course, those who deny God and His Messengers, and God and His Messengers, Want to Kha and say that we believe in Falcon and denying the Falcon And want to go a different way through this, these people are genuinely Kafirs and we have prepared a wonderful miracle for the Kafirs and those who believe in God and its principles and do not hate any of them, Only people will soon be able to offer their weapons, and God is a very splendid kind of first person who requests you to do a work on them
 Let the book get out of the sky, these people have requested Moses to go much further than this
 Chunanche started saying that let us show God openly, then because of their mischief, the electricity was taken away and then they have the promise and light of the Tauheed
 Even after that was done, those people made the calf, then we went through it too and we gave Moses the real mistake, and because of his faith and scale, we had to beat him Taka has and we have entered while prostrate during door told him and we said You do not leave the day of the week and we took a very strong ehodo measure from them, then to break their own ahid and refuse to do good thing and kill unscrupulous Ambia and say that there is a grudge on our hearts
 Rather God has stamped on their hearts because of their infidelity, so except for a few men these people do not believe and their kafir and Mary are very big Because of Hattan Baadhne and because of his saying that we killed the Rasul of Mary God's son Isa God, although neither those people killed him nor did the crucifix give them to Mushabeh and those who i have to talk about this, they are definitely deceived by the people, they are not only in the news about it but they are behind the speculation and they did not kill Jesus for sure, but God gave them Company lifted aside and truly Allah big powerful contrivance and Ehle book There will be no person who does not believe in his death and will testify against him on the Day of Judgment because of the mischief and crime of the Jews, we have given them clean and clean things which were done for them
 And because of stopping many people from their own way and despite eating Mumaniyat Sud and forcibly eating the goods of the people, those of them who We have prepared painful wonders for those who have done it, but those of them who are very strong in Ilm, they are the ones who have faith and those who are proud of you and offer prayers and offer zakat and for the sake of God and the end of life
 We believe that we will give very similar weapons to people like this, we have sent the same 'same' to you in the same way as Noah and the subsequent texts

 san 1953 main watson or crik ne di en e kii sanrachana kaa pataa lagaaya or batya, ki yah do tantuon se bana hua ghumaavdaar seedhinuma, yaa dohari kundalini ke aakaar kaa hota he
 The entire genome of any animal is called a genome
 maanav sharir hajaaron-lakhon jivit koshikaon kaa bana hua he, jinhen ham koshikaon ke naam se jaanate hai
 Each cell is so subtle that we cannot see it only with our eyes
 use dekhne ke liye sookshmdarshi kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 There is a nucleus inside each cell
 prayek kendrak ke andar dhaage ke aakaar kii sanrachanaayen hoti hai, jinhen gunasutra kehete hai
 Each nucleus has 46 chromosomes
 23 gunsutra pita se va 23 mata se aate hai
 These chromosomes are made up of proteins and nucleic acids
 jise di en e kehete hai
 The structural unit of a nucleic acid is a nucleotide
 jab ek koshika kaa vibhaajan hokar do koshikaayen banatin hai, tab unka jinom bhi duguna ho jaataa he
 At the time of cell division, both fibers of DNA are separated and a new complement of each fiber is formed by the rule of nucleotide pairing or base pairing
 atah prayek nayi koshika ke di en e main ek nayaa or ek purana tantu hota he
 The new filament that is formed by following the rule of base pairing is an exact copy of the old filament
 di en e chaar mul beson kaa bana hota he: The a of one fiber connects with the t of the other fiber, and the c of one fiber connects with the g of the other fiber
 ek di en e kaa tantu duusare kaa sampoorak hota he
 Therefore, if the sequence of one fiber is known, the other can be found
 in do tantuon ke bich hydrogen bandha hote hai, jo do beson ko jodate hai
 The specific sequence of different base pairs of DNA is called a gene
 vastutah jin hi anuvaanshikta kii bhautik va kayik ikai he
 This encodes information that directs protin synthesis
 aisa anumaan he, ki lagbhag ek se ded tak jin prayek koshika main hai, jo hamaare sharir ke sabhi kaaryon ko sampann karne main sakasham hai
 But such genes are only about three percent in the cell
 shesh 97% di en e junk yaa bekaar di en e he, jiskaa sahi kaary aaj bhi gyaat nahin he
 It is a very ambitious large and most expensive biological project
 america ke urja vibhaag tathaa neshnal inshtitute of health kii bhagidaari se, san 1988 main maanav jinom pariyojna prarambh hui
 It was formally launched in 1990
 kalantar main isane vishwavyaapee rup dhaaran kiya
 It includes about 250 laboratories from eighteen countries
 iske mukhya lakshya hai:- In humans, on average, each chromosome contains approximately thirteen million base pairs
 or puure jinom main lagbhag teen sau karod ksharak yugma paye jate hai
 The main objective of the human genome project is to detect the sequence of four bases of DNA present in the characteristic formula of each cell
 jinom ko anukramit karne ke liye sarv pratham di en e kii aavashyaktaa thi, jiske liye maanav daataaon kii sahaayta lee gayi
 People were called around the laboratory or center by giving advertisements
 unke rakt ke namoonay praapt kiye gayi
 Samples were given a number by erasing the donor's name
 isaliye ki koun sa namoona kis vyakti vishesh se liya gaya he, iskaa pataa naa chal sake
 The laboratory concerned would select samples from it
 koshikaon kaa sanvardhan karne ke liye, inaki cell line banaai gayi, taaki ve mar naa saken
 Ultimately, DNA was extracted from these cells
 di en e ke chote chote tukde banaakar use jeevanu main clonan kiya gaya
 Finally, genome sequencing was determined by sequencing all clones with the help of a computer
 jinom kii sanrachana kaa pataa lagane ke liye unnat robotic mashiinon kaa upyog kiya ja rahaa he
 These machines are capable of processing twelve thousand units per minute
 is pariyojna se praapt hone vaali jaankaree yaa data kii vishaal maatra, vigyaan ke kshetra main, ek kirtiman he
 Although today we have been able to read the entire genetic code of humans, but this task is not that simple
 shuru se ant tak keval e tii si or ji ke bhinn bhinn anukram se bani hui yah kuta samhita, yadi lekhi jaye, to do sau se adhik dhoorbhaash nirdeshikaayen bhar jaayengin
 Use of the human genome structure is possible only when information about the function of proteins produced by thousands of genes is accessible
 jin main vidyaman di en e ke kshaaron kaa kram protein ke amino amla kaa kram tay karata he
 The project will also explore how genes express themselves
 yah bhi pataa kagaaya jaayegaa, ki maanav jati ke jeenon ke bich itani vibhinnataayen kyon hai or kaise panpin
 The structures of human genes will also be compared to the structures of other organisms
 dophrancis colence, jo ki is maanav pariyojna ke adhyaksh hai, kaa maananaa he, ki 2050 tak jinomix yaa jinom vigyaan ek upyogi vidha ke rup main sthapit ho jaayegaa
 India is also not untouched by the international human genome project
 san 1999 main, chennai main yojit rashtriya vigyaan congress main, jinom sammit naam se ek divasiy satr yojit kiya gaya, jisaki adhyakshata james watson ne kii thi
 In the session, the scientists of the country were of the opinion that India should take advantage of this genome era
 kyonki bharat ke paas paryaapt avasar hai
 In fact, India is a living giant laboratory of genetics due to its ethnic and tribal community
 anthropological survey of india dwaara prakashit pustak pipal of india main bataaya gaya he, ki bharat main vibhinn samudaayon kii kul sankhya chaar hazaar chah sau paitis he, jisamen 75 luptpraaya janajatiyaan bhi shaamil hai
 Scientists at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, in Bhart, are engaged in making a genographic map of India
 abtak chaudaa vibhinn samudaayon ke jin pahachaane ja chuke hai
 And the study of the distribution of genes causing common diseases is being studied
 bharat sarkaar ke jaev praudyogiki vibhaag ke anusaar, desh bhar main unnat anusandhan kendron kaa jaal bichaaya jaayegaa
 It plans to set up its first center in Bangalore
 iskaa naam maanav anuvaanshiki anusandhan centre rakhaa gaya he
 It has many applications, the main of which are: - jinom pariyojna kaa sarvaadhik laabh chikitsa kshetra main hoga
 Earlier it used to take many years to find a gene linked to a disease, and hundreds of scientists had to try for it
 jinom anukraman kii jaankaree se aisi jin ke pataa lagane kaa kaary ab kuch maheenon main vaigyanikon kaa ek chota samooh bhi kar sakegaa
 Thirty diseases have been detected so far by direct use of publicly available genome sequencing
 isamen tar-sacks syndrome, cysticks fibroris, harrington rog aadi pramukh hai
 The following objectives will be achieved with this molecular therapy: - maanav jinom pariyojna se praapt data base ke aadhaar par vishisht maamalon main vyakti kii pahchaan saral evam teevr gati se sambhav hogi
 This can prove beneficial in cases where the suspected criminal can be arrested on the basis of his DNA

 What will be the nature of medicine after almost a hundred years from today? Looking at the constantly progressing biotechnology, it seems that what is impossible today will become the reality of medicine and diagnosis of tomorrow
 maanav jinom kii gutthi sulajhane vaale sarkari or nijee vaigyanik aapasi matbhedon ko abhi tak sulajhaa nahin paae hai jisase unke paraspar sahyog main baadhaaen aa rahi hai
 This project of reading the book of human life has been stuck in many circles of controversy and accusations
 yahaan tak ki maanav diene kii sanrachana kaa prakaashan bhi do alag-alag vigyaan patrikaon main karnaa padaa kyonki aankadon ko lekar baari vivaad tha
 The detection of the functions of proteins made by the human genome from one lakh to one and a half million will make it possible to diagnose the following problems: maanav jinom kaa puraa hona hamaare liye us pustkaalay ke praveshdwar par pahunchane ke samaan he, jisaki vibhinn pustakon main teen sau karod akshar bikhare pade hai
 To read these books, first of all we have to identify the words by mixing those letters, making sentences with commas, semicolons and full breaks, that is, to find genes
 doosraa mahatvapurn kadam hoga, sabhi jeenon ke kaaryon kaa pataa lagaana
 The functions of barely a thousand genes have been detected so far
 teesraa kadam he, us 97% junk di en e ke kaary kaa pataa lagaana
 Bioinformatics, or bioinformatics, is a new field of biology that covers the acquisition, storage, processing, analysis, distribution, interpretation, etc
 of bioinformatics
 is kaary main jeev vigyaan soochna takanic tathaa ganit kii takneekein upyog main laai jaatin hai
 Bioinformatics requires the following tools: maanav sharir main anek prakaar ke protein hote hai
 Proteins have long chains of amino acids, and they are made up of 20 different amino acids
 prayek amino amla ke rasinic gun bhinn hote hai, tathaa unka vibhinn proteinon main hone vaala anukram bhi bhinn hota he
 Because of this, each protein is a specially structured and this structure is suitable in every way for its function
 protein kisi jeev kii jivan kshamta or koshikeey kriyavidhi ke liye sidhe sidhe uttaradaayi hote hai
 Proteinomics is a science by which we can analyze the proteins found in the cells of the human body at different times, at the same time, and at a rapid speed
 or isse koshika main proteinon kii antahsthioti kaa maanchitr taiyaar kar sakate hai
 In English it is called structural genomics
 jinom anukraman pariyojnaon kii safalataa tathaa protein sanrachanaon ko sulajhane ke anek prayaason ne sanrachana jaev vaigyanikon ko sanrachana jinomix ke vikaas ke liye protsaahit kiya he
 This field has also developed extensively, under which the purpose of solving the structure of all the proteins of humans is
 protein hi har jeev kii sanrachana karte hai
 Not only this, digestive disease prevention, body chemistry also determine all activities
 sankshep main har praani kaa praan protein hi he
 If the same protein is ingested in some way or some part of it is lost, then there is a possibility of disease
 isko jaanane ke liye protein sanrachana kaa gyaan hona aavashyak he
 Human being is identified by its qualities and name
 do vyakti sabhi gunon main samaan nahin hote
 Even twins, no matter how similar, still have differences
 twachaa kaa rang, baalo kaa rang, ankhon kii putliyon kaa rang, lambaai, awaz, chalane, uthne baithne kaa dhang, baat karne kaa tarika, rahan-sahan aadi aise lakshan hai, jinase manushyon main antar or pahchaan kii ja sakati he
 There was a need to legalize human personal identity and difference
 prayek maanav ke anguliyon ke nishaan bhinn hote hai
 The protuberances in them occur at different places
 is kaaran jo chitra banataa he, use angul chhap yaa finger print kehete hai
 In fact, it is a method of legally identifying humans, which francis-golton discovered long ago and is still practiced today
 yah prakruti kii dein he
 The Jeevan Sutra, that is, in all living organisms of the world, is based on heredity like humans
 yah kisi bhi jeev kii har sookshm ikai main paaya jaataa he
 Each organism can be distinguished from any other organism on the basis of subtle variations hidden in this life formula derived from its biological parents
 di en e finger printing ek nutan evam shashakt takanic he, jo nimnlikhit kshetron main prayog main laayi ja sakati he:- In 1988, the research group of Dr
 Lalji Singh, Senior Scientist, Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, India, conducted B

 Because each person has a DNA of both the parents, this can be confirmed on the basis of the impression of the DNA
 forensik jaev praudyogiki abhi ek nayaa kshetra he, jo jangalon main hone vaale aparaadhon ko sulajhaayen ke liye ek hathiyaar kii tarah prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 The Indian judicial system has accepted DNA finger printing as concrete evidence
 mritak ke sharir ke bikhare hue tukdon kii pahchaan karne ke liye bhi is takanic kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 This technique was used for former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and former Chief Minister of Punjab Beant Singh
 inke atirikt anek aparaadhon ke maamle is takanic dwaara sulajhaaye gaye hai
 Comparison of the commands received by DNA finger printing with the remains of the bodies of the dead defensemen during accidents, such as a war period, or a shipwreck, as compiled in the biographies of defense personnel
 The method can be proven

 It can prove to be more good and help in the development of desired castes
 yah vidhi ek hi prakaar ke nar yaa maadaa paudhon ke chayan main sahaayak siddh ho sakati he
 Such as guava, dates, etc
, in which only female plants are desired, and the gender is known only after a long time
 aise maamalon main is vidhi kaa prayog karke samay, shram evam dhan kii bachat kii ja sakati he
 The DNA fingerprinting method can prove the originality of the cell and can be expected to progress in both the fields of research and industry, or industry only, by being used in other research works
 jab di en e ke bahut se bhaagon kaa adhyayan ek hi saath kiya jaataa he, to vah di en e finger priting kehalaata he, tathaa jab di en e ke ek hi bhaag kaa pareekshan kiya jaataa he, to use di en e typing kehete hai
 The more parts are tested simultaneously, the greater the reliability of finger prints

 After the attack, US President George William Bush had demanded from the Taliban that Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden was turned down by the Taliban, saying that the US would first show evidence of bin Laden's involvement in the attack, which Bush turned down and Afghanistan i declared war against such fundamentalist groups
 congress haul main bush dwaara die gaye bhaashan main bush ne kaha ki yah yuddh tab tak khatm nahin hoga jab tak puri tarah se afghanistan or pakistan main se charampanth khatm nahin ho jaataa
 For this reason, even today, the US military in Afghanistan and Pakistan is fighting a war against these groups
 
 The Afghanistan war started in 1978 after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan
 soviet sena ne apni jabardast sainya kshamta or aadhunik hathiyaaro ke dam par badi maatra main afghanistan ke kai ilaakon par kabza kar liya
 To crush this great success of Soviet Union, its old enemy America resorted to Pakistan

 Shortly after the start of the war, there were fierce and destructive battles in Afghanistan

 Osama or Mullah Omar never directly participated in all these battles
 kila-e-jangi kii ladaai afghanistan yuddh main ladi gai ab tak ki sabase badi ladaaiyon main se ek thi
 Northan Alliance, an ally of the NATO army in Afghanistan, called several Taliban fighters to surrender at a place called qila-e-jangi
 taliban ne kile main aakar apane kuch hathiyaar saunp die tathaa kuch hathiyaaro ko apane sharir main chipa liya
 Northorn Alliance soldiers instead of leaving all Taliban fighters imprisoned them in a closed room

 Many soldiers were in the second part of the fort with some American journalists who were shocked by the sounds of the blasts and the guns

 However, it is also true that after the NATO forces invaded Afghanistan, the Taliban were removed from power in Afghanistan, which again led to democratic elections in the country and the beginning of a democratic polity in the country

 According to a conference organized by Statistics Canada and The United States Censor Bureau titled "challenges of Meshing in the Ethnic World: Science, Politics, and Reality", "ethnicity is a fundamental factor in human life: it is an underlying fact of human experience
" " yadhyapi, maanavvigyaani fredrick barth or erik woolf jaise kai saamaajik vaigyanik jaateey pahchaan ko saarvbhaumik nahin maanate hai
 They consider it to be the product of a specific type of intergroup interaction, rather than considering ethnicity as an important trait inherent in a human group
 jo prakriyaayein is prakaar ke pahchaan ke udbhav kaa kaaran banati hai, unhen prajativrutt kehete hai

 According to Thomas Hillland Eriksen, two different arguments dominated the study of ethnicity
 ek, "aadimavad" or "karnavaad" ke bich he
 In primitive terms, the participle assumes ethnic relations as a social bond, combined, externally provided, which may also be aggressive
 duusari ore karanvaadi drushtikon ke anusaar, jaateeyata mukhyatah ek raajnneetik ranneeti kaa ek tadarth tatv he, jise hit samoohon ke liye dhan, shakti yaa ohade main vruddhi jaise duusare darje ke lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye sansaadhan ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 This debate is still used as an important reference in political science, although the views of most scholars remain between the two poles
 duusari bahes "rachnawad" or "tathvikwaad" ke bich he
 Constructivists often view national and ethnic identities as historical forces, even when identities are presented as archaic
 tathvikwaadi is tarah ke parichay ko saamaajik karrwai ke parinaam ke bajaay, saamaajik kartaaon ko paribhaashit karne vaale sattamulak shreniyon ke rup main dekhte hai
 According to Eriksen, these debates were sidelined, particularly by the efforts of scholars in anthropology to respond to the increasingly politicized forms of self-leadership by members of various ethnic groups and nations

 Cited in 18–24) haalanki, "jaateey" samooh ke aadhunik upyog, audyogic rajyon kaa adhinsth samoohon ke saath vibhinn prakaar kii muthbhedon ko darshata he, jaise ki apravasiyata or upnivesh vishay; "jaateey samooh" ko "raashtra" ke virodh main un logon ko sanderbhit karne ke uddeshy se khadaa kiya gaya, jinaki alag saanskrithik pahchaan hoti he or jo pravaas yaa vijay ke madhyam se, kisi videshi rajya ke adheen ho gaye hai
 The modern use of the term is relatively new — the term ethnic group was first used in 1851 - 1935 and entered the Oxford English Dictionary in 1972
 oxford english dictionari kii aadhunik upyog sambandhi paribhaasha is prakaar he: a n Writing about the use of the English word "ethnic" in the common language of Great Britain and the United States, Wallman comments that is prakaar vartmaan bolchaal kii bhashaa main, aaj bhi "ethnic" or "ethnicity" shabd ke chaaron ore videshi logon, alpsankhyak muddon or jaateey sambandhon kaa ek gheraa bana hua he
 However, in the realm of social sciences, it is commonly used for all human groups who explicitly consider themselves culturally distinct and also perceived by others
 "ethnic group" shabd ko saamaajik vigyaan main laane vaale pratham vyaktiyon main german samajashastri maiks webar bhi shaamil hai, jo ise is rup main paribhaashit karte hai: Human groups who consider the subjective notion of their common origins to be due to the same physical structure or customs or both, or because of memories of colonization and migration; This assumption should be important for group formation; Furthermore, it does not matter whether a specific blood relationship exists
 webar kaa kahana he ki jaateey samooh cunstlish the, kyonki ve saajha gamineshaft main aatmanishth dharna par aadhaarit the
 Secondly, this belief in the shared gemineshaft did not create the group, but the group built the trust
 tisare, samooh gathan, shakti or rutabe par ekadhikaar karne kii hode kaa nateeja tha
 This was contrary to the prevailing naturalist notion of the time, according to which socio-cultural and behavioral differences of people arise from hereditary traits and tendencies derived from common lineages, which were then called "races"
 jaateeyata ke ek or prabhaavshaalee siddhanthapremi the fredrick barth, jinke 1969 se "ethnic grups and boundriz" ko 1980 or 1990 ke dashakon main saamaajik adhyayan main is shabd ke upyog ke prasar main sahaayak ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 Barth also surpassed Weber in emphasizing the construction of the nature of ethnicity
 barth ke liye, donon bahya aropan or aantarik aatm-pahchaan ke dwaara nirantar rup se vaarta or punarvaata hi jaateeyata thi
 In Barth's opinion, ethnic group hierarchies are not disjunctive cultural solitude or logical a priori to which people naturally belong
 ve samskritiyon ke paribaddh tatv or jaateeyata ko aadimavaadi bandhan maanane vaali maanavshastreey dharanaon se dur rahanaa or use samoohon ke bich parthaky prishth par dhyaan sankendran ke saath pratisthapit karnaa chaahate the
 Therefore, the focus on mutual affiliation of ethnic identity is "ethnic groups and boundaries"
 barth likhte hai: " nirnayaatmak jaateey bhed gatishiltaa, sampark or jaankaree ke abhaav par nirbhar nahin he, lekin isamen apvarjan or samavesh kii saamaajik prakriyaayein shaamil hai jisase vyaktigat jivan itihaas ke dauraan unki sahabhaagita or sadsyta main badlaav ke baavjood, asatat shreniyon ko barkaraar rakhaa jaataa he
 " 1978 main, maanav vigyaani ronaald kohen ne daawa kiya ki "saamaajik vaigyanikon ke upyog main "jaateey samoohon" kii pahchaan, aksar deshi yatharth se adhik, galat label ko pratibimbit karti he:

 In relation to the language, his idea was - 'when we accept foreign words with foreign expressions, then make them so that the foreignness comes out of them and they become disciplined by our grammar rules
 ' isliye jahaan kahin unhone apni bhashaa main 'urdu' ke prachlit shabdon kaa prayog kiya he, vahaan unka urdupan nikaal diya he, kalam, kavayad, kanoon aadi shabdon ke neeche kii bindi hataakar or unke uccharan badal kar unhone unka prayog liya he
 Similarly, by removing the rarity of Sanskrit words, they are written in Hindi in a simple way - like work in place of work, anjan in place of anjan
 shabd chayan ke bare main babu shyamsundar das kaa mat tha- 'sabase pehla sthaan shuddh hindi ke shabdon ko, uske peeche sanskrit ke sugam or prachlit shabdon ko, iske peeche farsi aadi videshi bhashaaon ke saadhaaran or prachlit shabdon kaa or sabase peeche sanskrit ke aprachlit shabdon ko sthaan diya jaae
 Never use difficult words in foreign languages like Persian

 sahitya ke samast kshetron ke abhaavon ko dur karne ke liye unhone sankalpabaddh hokar shram kiya
 Due to his achievements as a language philosopher or as a lecturer of the principles, literary literature remained a destiny of Hindi students for a long time
 inke man main yah dharna nirbhaant rahi ki hindi kii saidhantik samiksha kaa aadhaar sanskrit or pashchimi aalochana-siddhanton ko mila kar or unhen ek khaas saamanjasy ke saath hi banaaya janaa chahie
 Prior to Shyam Sundar Das there was a particularly critical time for Hindi and Nagari script
 pratap narayan mishra ne kai sthanon par hindi ke prachaar ke liye sabhaayen sthapit kii thim
 One such meeting was established in 1884 in Prayag under the name of 'hindi Savarni Pratik Madhya Bharat Sabha'
 sarkari dacrataron main nagari ke pravesh ke liye bhaaratendu harishchandra ne bhi kai baar udhyam kiya, par unhen safalataa nahin mil saki
 Despite this, the effort continued
 adalati bhashaa urdu hone ke kaaran navshikshiton main urdu padhane waalon kii sankhya adhik thi, jisase hindi pustakon ke prakaashan kaa kaary aage nahin bad paata tha
 In addition to this literature-crisis, the entry of Nagari into the government offices was a grave crisis in front of people who knew it
 isi daur main kuch utsaahi chaatro ke udyog se, jinamein babu shyaam sundar das pramukh the, 1893 main kaashi nagari prachaarini sabha kii sthapana kii gayi
 Here too, remember the statement of Ramchandra Shukla that, 'tell me the truth, all the prosperity and fame of this gathering is the fruit of Babu Shyam Sundar Das's sacrifice and continuous hard work
 ve aadi se ant tak iske pranaswaroop sthit hokar baraabar ise anek bade udyogon main tatpar karte rahe
 Its first chairman was Bharatendu's brother-in-law Radhakrishna Das
 ’ nagari prachaar ke andolan ne hindi-premiyon main nayaa utsaah paidaa kiya or bahut se log sahitya kii shrivriddhi main samarpit bhav se lag gayi
