 angreji sena kaa senapati tha robert clive or sirajudaula kaa senapati tha mirajafar

 In which he has prayed that if Plassey wants to win the war, then more soldiers should be given to me

 unhen koi putr nahin tha
 Had only three daughters
 badi ladki chhasiti begum ni:santaan thi
 There were one son each from the second and third
 jiskaa naam shaukatganj, or sirajuddaula tha
 He loved Siraj-ud-daula more
 isliye apane jivan kaal main hi usne apana uttaradhikari ghoshit kar diya tha
 Alvardi died on 10 April 1756
 or sirajuddaula bengal kaa nawab bana parantu shuru se hi east india company ke saath uskaa sangharsh avashyabhavi ho gaya
 Finally on 23 June 1757 a war broke out between the two known as the Plassey War
 is yuddh ke anek kaaran the jo is prakaar he
 Internal conflict- gaddi par baithte hi sirajuddaula ko shaukatganj ke sangharsh kaa saamana karnaa padaa kyonki shaukatganj nawab bananaa chahta tha
 In this, he had the support of Chhati Begum and his Divan Rajavallavas and the Mughal Emperor, so Siraj-ud-daulah first tried to resolve that internal conflict
 kyonki isi ke chalate bengal kii raajnneeti main angrejon kaa hastkshep badhata ja rahaa tha nawab ne shaukatganj kii hatya kar di
 And after that he decided to compete with the British
 angrej dwaara nawab ke viruddh shadyantra- From the very beginning, the British were eyeing Bengal
 kyonki bengal ek upjau or dhani praant tha
 Had Bengal been the company's authority, it hoped to earn more and more money
 itnaa hi nahin ve hindu vyapaariyon ko apni ore milakar unhen nawab ke viruddh bhadakaana shuru kiya nawab ise pasand nahin karata tha
 Use of business facilities - mughal samraat ke dwaara angrejon ko nishulk saamudrik vyapaar karne kii chhot mili thi lekin angrejon ne iskaa durupyog karnaa shuru kiya
 They also started doing their personal business free of charge and encouraged the native traders to do business without paying tax
 isse nawab ko aarthik kshati pahunchati thi
 The Nawab did not like them when, when he decided to stop the misuse of business facilities, the British came out on the struggle
 angrejon dwaara kile bandi- At this time there was a possibility of a seven-year war in Europe
 jisamen england or france ek duusare ke viruddh ladane vaale the at: duusare desh main bhi jo angrej or francisi the
 He feared war
 isliye apni- 2 sthiti ko majboot karne ke liye unhonen kilebandi karnaa shuru kiya
 The Nawab could not destroy it
 angrej dwaara sirajuddaula ko nawab kii manyata nahin dena- According to the ancient tradition of Bengal, if a new Nawab sat on the throne, then on that day there was a court
 or uske adheen nivas karne vaale raajaaon, amiron yaa videshi jatiyon ke pratinidhiyon ko darbar main upasthit ho kar uphaar bhet karnaa padataa tha
 That they accept the new Nawab
 parantu sirajuddaula ke rajyabhishek ke avasar par angrejon kaa koi pratinidhi darbar main hajir nahin hua
 Because they did not consider Siraj-ud-daulah as Nawab, due to this, the possibility of conflict between the two increased
 nawab badalane kii koshish- The British wanted to replace siraj-ud-daulah and make someone who was ready to follow his instructions, the British started trying to do this
 aisi paristhiti main sangharsh taala nahin ja saktaa tha
 Invasion of Calcutta jab nawab ne kile bandi karne ko rokane kaa aadesh jari kiya to angrejon ne usapar koi dhyaan nahin diya wo kile kaa nirmaan karte rahe
 The Nawab became angry on this and attacked Kothi of Kasimbazar on 4 June 1756
 angrej sainik is akraman se ghabadaa gaye or angrejon kii paraajay hui or kasim bazaar par nawab kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 After this, the Nawab attacked Fort William of Calcutta very soon, even the British soldiers could not get the teak in front of the Nawab and the Nawab also got the right
 is yuddh main kaaphi angrej sainik giraftaar kiye gayi
 Black closet accident uparyukt ladaai main nawab ne 146 angrej sainikon ko kaid kar liya to use ek choti si andheri kothri main band kar diya isaki lambaai 18 feet or chaudaai 14- 10 feet thi
 It was built by the British and Indian criminals were stopped in it
 chunki garmi kaa din tha or yuddh ke parim the 123 sainikon kii mrityu dam ghutane ke kaaran ho gai or 23 sainik bache jisamen hanwel ek angrej sainik bhi tha
 He informed about this incident to the British of Madras
 isi durghatana ko kaali kothri kii durghatana ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Due to this the anger of the British erupted and they started preparing for war with the Nawab
 angrejon dwaara kalakatta par pun: adhikaar- To avenge his defeat, the British soon attacked Calcutta
 is samay nawab ne manikchand ko kalakatta kaa raja niyukt kiya tha
 But he was a friend and well wisher of the British
 falat: angrejon kii vijay hui kalakatta nawab ke changul se mukt ho gaya
 The Treaty of Ali Nagar was signed between the two on 9 February 1757 and the British again got all kinds of practical rights
 francisiyon par angrejon kaa akraman- The British attacked Chand Nagar, the town of the French
 or use apane adhin kar liya
 The French were friends of the Nawab, so the Nawab was very upset with this incident
 mirajafar ke saath gupt sandhi – At the same time, the British hatched a conspiracy to depose the Nawab
 isamen nawab ke bhi kai log shaamil the
 Such as Raidullabh chief commander Mirzafar and rich businessman Jagat Sevak etc
 angrejon ne mirajafar ko bengal kaa nawab banane kaa pralobhan diya or iske saath gupt sandhi kii is sandhi ke pashchaat nawab par yah aarope lagaaya gaya ki unhone ali nagar kii sandhi kaa ulanghan kiya he or usee kaa bahaanaa banaakar angrej ne nawab par 22 june 1757 ko akraman kar diya
 a fierce battle ensued in the battle of Plassey, Mirzafar had already signed a treaty with the British, which resulted in a tremendous defeat of the Nawab
 angrejon kii vijay hui
 The Nawab was assassinated and Mirzafar was made the Nawab of Bengal
 plasi yuddh ke parinaam- The foundation of the British Empire was laid in Bengal by the Battle of Plassey
 angrejon ko nawab banaaya gaya
 The Battle of Plassey was not really a war; it was a conspiracy and a display of treachery
 According to the famous historian 'panivkar', Plassey's war was not, but the result was quite significant
 isliye ise vishwa ke nirnaayak yudhon main sthaan uplabdh he
 Because by this the foundation of British Empire was laid in Bengal
 clive ne is yuddh ko kranti kii sangya di he
 In fact it was a revolution because it brought a great change in the stream of Indian history and a business institution took the political reins of Bengal in its hands
 iske vibhinn tarah ke parinaam drushtigochar hote hai
 Political Results- iske raajnneetik parinaam bharat ke liye ghaatak siddh hua
 This led to the incorporation of political rights in the hands of a business institution and the establishment of British power in India
 vastut: yah british raashtra ke liye atyadhik mahatv tha is yuddh ke pashchaat mirajafar ko bengal kaa nawab banaaya gaya
 But this was an inept person
 iske ayogyata kafaita uthaate hue bengal kaa vaastavik shaasha angrej ban gaye
 The influence of the British on Bengal increased and gradually the path of expansion of 2 British Empire was cleared
 sirajuddaula ke hatane se angrejon ko raajnneetik prabhutv badhaane kaa phayda mila
 The result of B
 Plassey proved fatal to the Mughal Empire, every year the Mughal ruler used to earn a good income from Bengal, but now this income is exhausted
 angrejon ko bhartiya nareshon ko kamajori kii jaankaree mil gai
 In the future, he took great advantage of it and paved the way for the conquest of northern India
 aarthik parinaam- The war brought considerable economic benefits to the British, Mirzafar gave Rs 1 crore 17 lakh to the company, which strengthened the economic condition of the company, due to the plunder of Bengal, it cost him a lot of money
 company ke math karmchaareeyon ko saadhe 12 lakh rupye mili
 Clive received two lakh 24 thousand rupees
 is yuddh ke pashchaat company dhire- 2 jagidaar baad main bengal kii dewan ban gai
 Thus it laid the foundation of British Empire in India
 angrejon ko pun: vyapaar karne kaa adhikaar mila mirajafar ne company ko ghus ke rup main 3 karod rupye pradaan kiye tathaa vyapaar se bhi angrejon ne 15 karod kaa munafa kamaaya
 By- mohammad shahid is ghatana se ek nai rajnatik shakti kaa udai hua

 khadi boli se taatpary khadi boli hindi se he jise bhartiya samvidhan ne rajbhasha ke rup main sweekrut kiya he
 From the point of view of linguistics, it has the distinction of being the basic foundation of ideal Hindi, Urdu and Hindustani
 khadi boli pashchim ruhelkhand, ganga ke uttari doaab tathaa ambala jile kii upbhasha he jo gramin janata ke dwaara maatrubhaasha ke rup main boli jaati he
 The region comprises Rampur, Bijnor, Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Moradabad, Saharanpur, the plains part of Dehradun, Ambala and Kalsia and the eastern part of the erstwhile Patiala state
 khadi boli vah boli he jisapar brajabhasha yaa avadhi aadi kii chhap na ho
 Cold hindi aaj kii rashtrabhasha hindi kaa purv rup
 Its history has been going on for centuries
 yah parinishthit pashchimi hindi kaa ek rup he
 'khadi Boli' is a form of present-day Hindi in which the current Hindi language was created by multiplying Sanskrit words and the current Urdu language was created by multiplying the words of Persian and Arabic
 duusare shabdon main, vah boli jisapar braj yaa avadhi aadi kii chhap na ho, thenth hindin
 Khadi Boli is the former form of today's national language Hindi
 yah parinishthit pashchimi hindi kaa ek rup he
 Its history has been going on for centuries
 jis samay musalmaan is desh main aakar bas gaye, us samay unhen yahan kii koi ek bhashaa grahan karne kii aavashyaktaa hui
 They had settled mostly in Delhi and its eastern provinces and could not adopt the Brajbhasha and Awadhi languages, due to their misery, so they accepted the dialect of Meerut and its surroundings and named it Khadi Boli
 isi khadi boli main ve dhire dhire farsi or arabi shabd milaate gaye jisase ant main vartmaan urdu bhashaa kii sristi hui
 Vikrami In the 14th century, Amir Khusro first started using this provincial dialect and wrote a lot of poetry in it, which being simple and succulent soon became prevalent
 bahut dinon tak musalmaan hi is boli kaa bolchaal or sahitya main vyavhaar karte rahe, par peeche hinduon main bhi iskaa prachaar hone laga
 In the 15th and 16th centuries, some Hindi poets also started using it somewhere in their poetry, but their number was often not the same
 adhikansh kavita baraabar avadhi or vrajabhasha main hi hoti rahi
 In the 18th century Hindus also began to treat it in literature, but not in poetry, only in prose; And since then, the present Hindi prose was born, whose Acharya Munshi Sadasukhlal, Lallu Ji Lal and Sadal Mishra are considered
 jis prakaar musalamaanon ne isamen farsi tathaa arabi aadi ke shabd bharkar vartmaan urdu bhashaa banaai, usee prakaar hinduon ne bhi usamen sanskrit ke shabdon kii adhikta karke vartmaan hindi prastut kii
 Here some people have started doing poetry in Sanskritpurchur current Hindi too and for the work of poetry, they call it Khadi Boli
 vartmaan hindi kaa ek rup jisamen sanskrit ke shabdon kii bahulata karke vartmaan hindi bhashaa kii or farsi tathaa arabi ke shabdon kii adhikta karke vartmaan urdu bhashaa kii sristi kii gai he
 In the literary context, modern Hindi literature is designated as Khadi Boli literature to segregate literature in the dialects of Braj, Awadhi etc
 yah bharatvarsh kii sarvaadhik prachlit, saral tathaa bodhgamy bhashaa he
 Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana are Hindi speaking states
 parantu inke atirikt sudur dakshin ke kuch sthanon ko chhodkar iskaa prachaar newnaadhik samast desh main he
 Khadi dialect has been designated by many names such as -hindai, Hindavi, Dakkhini, Dakhni or Dakni, Rekha, Hindostani, Hindustani etc
 dow grearsan ne ise varnacular hindustani tathaa dow suniti kumaar chatarji ne ise janapadiya hindustani kaa naam diya he
 Dr
 Chatterjee designates the literary form of Khadi Boli as Sadhu Hindi or Nagari Hindi
 parantu dow grearsan ne ise hai hindi kaa abhidhaan pradaan kiya he
 Different scholars have interpreted this differently
 in vidwaanon ke maton kii nimnaankit shreniyan he- Since ancient times, the land between the Himalayas and the Vindhya Mountains is known as Aryavarta
 isi ke bich ke pradesh ko madhya pradesh kaha jaataa he jo bhartiya samskruti tathaa sabhyataa kaa centrebindu he
 Sanskrit, Pali and Shaurseni Prakrit were the languages of this Madhya Pradesh in different eras
 kalkram se shauraseni praakrit ke pashchaat is pradesh main shauraseni apbhransh kaa prachaar hua
 This story has been converted into Shauraseni Apabhransh language, probably as a standing dialect
 is prakaar khadi boli kii utpatti shauraseni apbhransh se maani jaati he, yadhyapi is apbhransh kaa vikaas sahityak rup main nahin paaya jaataa
 The tradition of apabhramsa poems from the time of Bhoja and Hammirdev is reflected in the ancient form of the dialect standing within it
 iske uparaant bhaktikaal ke aarambh main nirgun dhara ke sant kavi khadi boli kaa vyavhaar apni sadhukkadi bhashaa main kiya karte the
 Some scholars are of the opinion that the standing dialect was brought into existence by Muslims and its original form is Urdu, from which the language of modern Hindi was created and extracted from Arabic Persian words
 suprasiddh bhashashasthri, dow grearsan ke matanusaar khadi boli angrejon kii dein he
 The demolition of the Mughal Empire helped in the promotion of the standing bid
 jis prakaar ujadati hui dilli ko chhodkar mir, insha aadi urdu ke anek shaayar purab kii ore aane lage usee prakaar dilli ke aasapaas ke hindu vyapaaree jeevika ke liye lakhanu, faijabad, prayag, kaashi, patna, aadi poorabi shaharon main failane lage
 Along with them, their colloquial language was also spoken
 is prakaar bade shaharon ke bazaar kii bhashaa bhi khadi boli ho gai
 This Khadi dialect was a real and natural language, not the urdu-e-muallah of the clerics and the Munshi
 19veen shatabdi ke purvardh ke sambandh main ve likhte hai ki yah samay hindi bhashaa ke janm kaa samay tha jiskaa avishkaar angrejon ne kiya tha or iskaa saahitiyik gadhy ke rup main sarvapratham prayog gilakraist kii ajna se lallu ji laal ne apane premsagar main kiya
 Lalluji Lal and Pt
 Sadal Mishra may be considered as the masters of the standing bidder or the progressor of it, but to call them the originators of the standing bid is true and not substantiated by the facts
 khadi boli kii pracheen parampara ke sambandh main dhyanpurvak vichaar karne par is kathan kii ayatharthata swayamev siddh ho jaati he
 Must have been helped in its spread by the Muslims
 urdu koi swatantra bhashaa nahin balki khadi boli kii hi ek style maatr he jisamen farsi or arabi ke shabdon kii adhikta pai jaati he tathaa jo farsi lipi main likhi jaati he
 This is clearly proved by focusing on the history of Urdu literature
 anek musalmaan kaviyon ne farsi mishrit khadi boli main, jise ve 'rekhta' kehete the, kavita kii he
 This tradition continued till Bahadur Shah, the last emperor of Delhi in the 18th-19th century and Wajidali Shah, the last Nawab of Lucknow
 saadhaarant: lallu ji laal, sadal mishra, inshwalla khan tathaa munshi sadasukhlal khadi boli gadhy ke pratishthapak kahe jate hai parantu inamen se kisi ko bhi isaki parampara ko pratishthit karne kaa saubhaahgya praapt nahin he
 The reputation of the modern Khadi Boli prose tradition is attributed to Bharatendu Babu Harishchandra and King Shivprasad Starshind who enforced a simple unanimous prose style through their works
 kalantar main logon ne bhaaratendu kii style adhik apanaai
 In fact, modern Hindi literature is the literature of the Khadi dialect for which Devanagari script is commonly treated and in which the words and motifs of Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit etc
 are present in the shadow of many languages and genologies prevalent in the country

 There is some incident in their past which creates a hatred in the mind against the people of that way or against the personality of that way and by seeing the same kind of personality, their mind gets angry due to which they lose their mind balance and He executes the incident

 It is said that most of the villages of India were settled by them
 jis me konkan, goa evam kerala kaa samavesh he
 According to the legend, Lord Parashuram drove the Tir and created a new land from Gujarat to Kerala, pushing the sea backward
 or isi kaaran konkan, goa or kerala me bhagwaan parashuram vandaneey he or tir ke tej se utpann brahman kly brahmarshi brahman bhi kehete he jisame bihar ke yoddha bhoomihaar brahman ,maharashtra ke chittapavan ,punjab ke mohayaal apni uttapati bhagwaan parashuram se maanate he 
 He was one of the most obedient children of the Bhargava gotra, who always followed the orders of his gurus and parents
 ve sadaa bado kaa sammaan karte the or kabhi bhi unki avhelnaa nahin karte the
 Their sense was to keep this living entity alive with its natural beauty
 ve chaahate the ki yah sari sristi pashu pakshiyon, vrikshon, fal phool oe samoochee prakruti ke liye jivant rahe
 He said that the king's religion is to spread the Vedic life and not to obey his subjects
 ve ek brahman ke rup main janmen avashya the lekin karm se ek kshatriya the
 He is also known as Bhargava
 yah bhi gyaat he ki parashuram ne adhikansh vidyaayein apni baalyavastha main hi apni mata kii shikshaaon se sikh lee thime 
 They understood the language of animals and birds and could speak to them
 yahan tak ki kai khoonkhwaar vanaile pashu bhi unke sparsh maatr se hi unke mitra ban jate the
 He imparted military education only to Brahmins
 lekin iske kuch apwaad bhi hai jaise bhishma or karn
 His well-known disciples were - karn ko yah gyaat nahin tha ki vah janm se kshatriya he
 He always understood himself but his power could not remain hidden
 unhon parashuram ko yah baat nahin bataai kii vah soot he or bhagwaan parashuram se shiksha praapt kar lee
 Even if Karna had told him about his Shudra, Lord Parashuram would have been willing to teach him gladly, seeing Karna's fast and strength
 kintu jab parashuram ko iskaa gyaan hua to unhone karn ko yah shraap diya kii unka sikhaaya hua sara gyaan uske kisi kaam nahin aayega jab use uski sarvaadhik aavashyaktaa hogi
 So when Karna and Arjuna are face to face in the battle of Kurukshetra, then he is killed by Arjuna because at that time Karna did not have the knowledge of running Brahmastra
 pracheen kaal main kannauj main gadhi naam ke ek raja rajya karte the
 She had a very beautiful girl named Satyavati
 raja gadhi ne satyavati kaa vivaah bhrigunandan rishik ke saath kar diya
 After the marriage of Satyavati, Bhrigu Rishi came there and blessed his daughter-in-law and asked her to ask for the bride
 is par satyavati ne shvasur ko prasann dekhakar unase apni mata ke liye ek putr kii yachana kii
 On Satyavati's plea, Bhrigu Rishi gave her two chars and said that when you and your mother have taken bath, then your mother will embrace the peepul with the desire of son and you embrace the sycamore with the same wish
 phir mere dwaara diye gayi in charuon kaa saavdhaanee ke saath alag alag seven kar lenaa
 Here, when Satyavati's mother saw that Bhrigu had given her daughter-in-law a better child, she replaced her charu with her daughter's charu
 is prakaar satyavati ne apni mata vaale charu kaa seven kar liya
 With the power of yoga, Bhrigu came to know about this and he came to his daughter-in-law and said that daughter! Your mother has tricked you and consumed your Charu
 isaliye ab tumhaari santaan brahman hote huye bhi kshatriya jaisaa aacharan karegi or tumhaari mata kii santaan kshatriya hokar bhi brahman jaisaa aacharan karegi
 On this, Satyavati pleaded with Bhrigu that you bless that my son should behave like a Brahmin, even though my grandson should behave like a Kshatriya
 bhrigu ne prasann hokar uski vinati sweekaar kar lee
 Jamadagni was born from the womb of Satyavati when the time came
 jamadagni atyant tejasvi the
 When he grew up, he was married to Prasenjit's daughter Renuka
 renuka se unke paanch putr hue jinke naam the - rukmavaan, sukhen, vasu, vishwanas or parashuram
 In the Shrimad Bhagwat, there is a parable that after seeing Gandharvaraja Chitraratha with Apsaras, Renuka went to take water on the banks of the Ganges for the Havan, and stayed there for some time
 havan kaal vyateet ho jane se cruddh muni jamadagni ne apni patni ke arya maryaada virdohi aacharan evam maansik vyabhichaar karne ke dandswaroop sabhi putron ko mata renuka kaa vadh karne kii ajna di
 Impressed by his father's temperament, Parshuram killed all his brothers who had come forward to decapitate the mother and save them, after the other brothers failed to do so
 unke is kaary se prasann jamadagni ne jab unase var maangane kaa aagrah kiya to parashuram ne sabhi ke punerjeevit hone evam unke dwaara vadh kiye jane sambandhi smriti nasht ho jane kaa hi var maanga
 The story is that Haihay Vanshadhpati Kaartavirya Arjun pleased Lord Dattatreya with extreme tenacity and got a thousand arms and got the boon of not being defeated in battle
 sanyogvash van main akhet karte vah jamadagrimuni ke ashram ja pahunchaa or devraj indra dwaara unhen pradutt kapila kamdhenu kii sahaayta se hue samast saindal ke adbhut aatithy satkar par lobhavash jamadagni kii avagya karte hue kamdhenu ko balpurvak chhinakar le gaya
 Kupit Parshuram cut off all his arms and struck the head with a torso, using an ax
 tab sahatrarjun ke putron ne pratishodh swaroop parashuram kii anupasthiti main unke dhyansth pita jamadagni kii hatya kar di
 Renuka became Sati after entering her husband's funeral pyre
 is kand se kupit parashuram ne puure veg se mahishmati nagari par akraman kar diya or us par apana adhikaar kar liya
 After this, he destroyed the Kshatriyas from this earth twenty-one times after another
 yahi nahin unhone haihay vanshi kshatriyon ke rudhir se sthalat panchak kshetra ke paanch sarovar bhar diye or pita kaa shraadh sahatrarjun ke putron ke rakt se kiya
 In the end, Maharishi Ritchik appeared and prevented Parashuram from doing such a terrible act
 iske pashchaat unhone ashwamegh mahayajna kiya or saptadweep yukt prithvi maharishi kashyap ko daan kar di
 Not only this, he gave up his weapons in front of Devraj Indra and started living in the ashram on the Mahendra mountain, the terrain that was sited by Sagar
 mana jaataa he ki parashuram ne 21 baar haihyavanshi kshatriyon ko samul nasht kiya tha
 There is a class of Kshatriyas called Haihayavanshi Samaj, this society still exists today
 isi samaaj main ek raja hue the sahatrarjun
 Parashuram killed this king and his sons and grandchildren and had to fight for it 21 times
 koun tha sahatrarjun ?: sahatrarjun ek chandravanshi raja tha jiske purvaj the mahishmant
 Mahishmant had established a city called Mahishmati on the banks of Narmada
 inhen ke kul main aage chalakar durdum ke uparant kanak ke chaar putron main sabase bade kritaviry ne mahishmati ke singhaasana ko samhaala
 Bhargava Vanshi Brahmins were his priests
 bhargav pramukh jamadagni rishi se kritaviry ke madhur sambandh the
 Kritavirya's son's name was also Arjuna
 kritaviry kaa putr hone ke kaaran hi unhen karttaviryarjun bhi kaha jaataa he
 Kartaviryaarjuna pleased Lord Dattatreya with his worship
 bhagwaan dattatreya ne yuddh ke samay karttaviryajun ko hajaar haathon kaa bal praapt karne kaa vardaan diya tha, jiske kaaran unhen sahatrarjun yaa sahasrabahu kaha jane laga
 Ravana was also frightened by Sahastrajun's might
 yuddh kaa kaaran: rishi vashishtha se shaap kaa bhaajan banane ke kaaran sahatrarjun kii mati maari gai thi
 Sahastrajun saw a Kapila Kamadhenu cow in the ashram of Parasurama's father, Jamadagni, and longing to get it, he forcefully took Kamdhenu from the ashram
 jab parashuram ko yah baat pataa chali to unhone pita ke sammaan ke khatir kamdhenu waapas laane kii sochi or sahatrarjun se unhone yuddh kiya
 In the battle, all the arms of Sahastrajun were cut and he was killed
 tab sahatrarjun ke putron ne pratishodhavash parashuram kii anupasthiti main unke pita jamadagni ko maar daalaa
 Parshuram's mother Renuka got distracted by her husband's murder and sati entered her funeral pyre
 is ghor ghatana ne parashuram ko krodhit kar diya or unhone sankalp liya-"main haihay vansh ke sabhi kshatriyon kaa naash karke hi dam loonga"
 He then fought the Haihayavanshi Kshatriyas of egotistical and evil nature 21 times
 krodhagni main jalte hue parashuram ne sarvapratham haihyavanshiyon kii mahishmati nagari par adhikaar kiya taduparant karttaviryarjun kaa vadh
 After the death of Kartaviryaarjuna, his five sons Jayadhwaj, Shursen, Shur, Vrish and Krishna continued to fight for their existence
 brahmavaivart puraana main kathanak miltaa he ki kailash sthit bhagwaan shankar ke ant:poor main pravesh karte samay ganesh ji dwaara roke jane par parashuram ne balpurvak andar jane kii cheshtha kii
 Then Ganapati stunned him and wrapped him in his trunk and made a visit to all the worlds and saw Lord Shri Krishna at Goloka and slammed it on the ground floor
 chetnavastha main aane par kupit parashuramji dwaara kiye gaye farse ke prahaar se ganesh ji kaa ek daant tut gaya, jisase ve ekadant kahalaaye
 He reached Mithilapuri by sky route when Shivaji's bow was disbanded at the time of Ramavatar in Tretayuga, first showing himself as "a world-wise Kshatriya total malevolent" and "be very angry" and be angry "sunhu Ram Jehi Shivdhanu Tora, Sahasabahu sum so ripu mora "till taduparant apni shakti kaa sanshay mitate hi vaishnav dhanush shriram ko saunp diya or kshamaa yachana karte hue "anuchit bahut kaheu agyaata, kshamhu kshamaamandir dou bhrata" tapasya ke nimitt van ko laut gayi
 These lines of the Ramcharit Manas bear witness - "kaha jai jai jai raghukulketu, bhrigupati gaye vanhinta hatu"
 valmiki ramayana main varnit katha ke anusaar dasharathanandan shriram ne jamadagni kumaar parashuram kaa pujan kiya or parashuram ne ramachandra kii parikrama kar ashram kii ore prasthaan kiya
 Even while going, he had requested Shri Ram for the continued affection of his devotees and strong devotion to the charanvindis
 bhishma dwaara sweekaar na kiye jane ke kaaran amba pratishodh vash sahaayta maangane ke liye parashuram ke paas aayi
 Then he assured Bhishma for the war while assuring help
 un donon ke bich 23 dinon tak ghamaasan yuddh chalaa
 But as a boon of death by his father, Parashurama could not defeat him
 parashuram apane jivan bhar kii kamai brahmanon ko daan kar rahe the, tab dronacharya unke paas pahunche
 But unfortunately they had donated everything by then
 tab parashuram ne dayabhav se droncharya se koi bhi astr-shastr chunane ke liye kaha
 Then the clever Dronacharya said that i want all your weapons including their mantras so that they can be used whenever they are needed
 parashuramji ne kaha-"evamastu!" arthath aisa hi ho
 With this, Dronacharya became proficient in weapons education
 parashuram karn ke bhi guru the
 He also taught various types of weapons to Karna and taught him to operate Brahmastra
 lekin karn ek soot kaa putr tha, phir bhi yah jaanate hue ki parashuram keval brahmanon ko hi apni vidha daan karte hai, karn ne chal karke parashuram se vidha lene kaa prayaas kiya
 Parashurama taught him a lot of scholars by considering him a Brahmin, but one day while Parashurama was sleeping with a head in the dock of Karna under a tree, a bumblebee came to bite at Karna's leg, no obstruction in his Guru's sleep
 That's why Karna bared the bunny, the bunny was severely biting Karna's leg, due to biting the bunny, Karna started bleeding
 wo khun bahata hua parashuram ke pairon tak ja pahunchaa
 Parashuram's sleep opened and he immediately recognized the blood that this blood could only belong to a Kshatriya who kept flowing for so long without being oozed
 is ghatana ke kaaran karn ko apni astr vidya kaa laabh nahin mil paaya
 According to another legend, Guru Parshuram was once sleeping with a thigh on Karna's head
 tabhi ek bichchhu kahin se aayaa or karn kii jangha par ghaav banane laga
 But the Guru's rest is not disturbed, so Karna endured the scorpion sting
 achaanak parashuram kii nidra tuuti or ye jaanakar kii ek bramhan putr main itani sahansheeltaa nahin ho sakati ki wo bichchhu ke dansh ko sahan kar le
 On Karna's falsification, he cursed her that when she needs her education most, it will not be useful to her

 Earth-lighting-equinox pl
png khagolashastra main vishuv samay ke us kshan ko kehete hai jiske aadhaar par kisi khagoleey nirdeshaank pranali ke tatwon kii paribhaasha kii jaati he
 For example, the equatorial coordinate system is one such method and in which the position of any object is placed according to the celestial midline, the celestial pole and the direction of the spring equinox
 dhyaan rahe ki samay ke saath yah sabhi badalte rahete hai isliye kisi khagoleey nirdeshaank pranali main ek samay ko maanak maanakar usee ke aadhaar par nirdeshaank bataaye jate hai
 The 'equinox' is something different from the epoch because the epoch is the time when the position of an astronomical object has been measured
 'vishuv' or 'yug' ko samajhane ke liye ek saral tulana di ja sakati he
 Suppose the person 'amit' is standing on an infinitely wide ground, but he is walking continuously
 yah bhi kalpana kijiye ki bahut se anya vyakti 'k', 'kha', 'ga', 'gha', ityadi bhi us maidan par he or ve bhi nirantar jagah-se-jagah chal rahe hai
 Now if we want, we can make a simple coordinate method based on 'amit'
 ham yah kah sakate hai ki 15 march 2012 ko thik paanch baje jahaan 'amit' tha, vahi hamaari nirdeshaank pranali kaa centre he
 This moment will be called the 'equinox'
 ab ham kisi bhi anya kshan par anya vastuon ke sthaan ko bataa sakate hai
 We can say that at exactly nine o'clock on 20 March 2012, person 'B' was 10 meters from the equinox position of Amit and 8 meters to the right
 yah samay 'yug' kehalaayegaa
 Note that at the moment of 'yuga', 'amit' was moved from where the coordinates are being told, but to clearly state the position of the 'equinox' moment of 'amit', make all the positions by making it the original center
 Are going khagolashastra main vastuon kii sthitiyaan isi tarah bataai jaati hai
 For a long time, these conditions are not exactly right, but they are quite right
 lekin kai saalon ke baad yah itani alag ho jaati hai ki khagolashastri nae vishuv or yug kaa chunaav karke apni sthaneey talikaon kaa adhyatan kar lete hai
 Newly chosen equinoxes and era moments are named
 khagolashastriyon dwaara vartmaan main istemaal hone vaale vishuv kaa naam J2000
0 he or yah 1 janvari 2000 ke dopaher ke 12 baje kaa kshan he
 The standard equinox used before this was named B1950

 When the traveler approaches the temple, first of all he sees a grand idol of Ganesha, which is built on a rock

 The temple is built in the Nagara style
 aisa kaha jaataa he jab atri muni yahaan se kuch hi duuri par tapasya kar rahe the to unki patni anasuia ne pativrat dharm kaa paalan karte hue is sthaan par apana nivas banaaya tha
 Kavindati says that when the glory of Goddess Anasuiya began to be sung in all the three worlds, Parvati, Lakshmi and Saraswati forced Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh to test Anusuiya's husbandry religion
 puranic katha ke anusaar tab ye tridev devi anasuia kii pariksha lene sadhuvesh main unke ashram pahunchein or unhone bhojan kii ichha prakat kii
 But she kept a watch in front of Anusuiya that she would sit on his lap and feed him naked with a hug
 is par anasuia sanshay main pads gai
 When he remembered his husband with closed eyes, he saw Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh standing as sadhus standing in front
 anusuia ne man hi man apane pati kaa samaran kiya or ye tridev chah maheene ke shishu ban gaye
 Then Mata Ansuiya fed the Tridevs according to their feet
 is prakaar tridev balyarup kaa anand lene lage
 On the other hand, the three women became unhappy at the disconnection of husbands
 tab naarad muni ke kehane par ve anasuia ke samaksh apane patiyon ko mul rup main laane kii prarthana karne lageen
 On the strength of his perseverance, Anasuiya brought the three gods back to the east
 tabhi se vah maa sati anasuia ke naam se prasiddh hui
 In the temple's womb lies the magnificent stone statue of Anasuya, on which is placed a silver umbrella
 mandir parisar main shiv, parvati, bhairav, ganesh or vanadevataaon kii murtiyon virajman hai
 The Trimukhi stone statue of Anasuiya's son, Lord Dattatreya, is situated at a distance from the temple

 The view of the Amrit Ganga and the waterfall outside the cave captivates the mind
