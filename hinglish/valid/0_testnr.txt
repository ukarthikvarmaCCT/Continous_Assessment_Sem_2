 The method of bringing uniformity in the methods of measurement of weights was considered many times in India, but only in September, 1956, the Weights and Measures Model Act was passed
 28 disambar 1956 i

 By adopting this system, the government got the right to implement the same type of measurement and weighing methods in the whole country
 isse vyapaar or vastuon ke yatayaat main badi sahaayta mili
 The ease of the decimal system also made it easier to calculate and weigh transactions

 The theory of relativity or relativity, or just relativity, is a fundamental theory of modern physics developed by Albert Einstein and has two major parts - specific relativity and general relativity
 phir bhi kai baar aapekshikta yaa relativity shabd ko gallilian invariens ke sandarbh main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The term, called Theory of Relativity, was first used by Max Planck in 1906
 yah angrezi shabd samooh "relative theory" se liya gaya tha jisamen yah bataaya gaya he ki kaise yah siddhant principal of relativity kaa prayog karata he
 In the discussion section of this paper, Alfred Booker used "theory of Relativity" for the first time
 aapekshikta siddhant sankshep main yah he ki 'nirpeksh' gati tathaa 'nirpeksh' twaran kaa astitv asambhav he, arthath 'nirpeksh gati' evam 'nirpeksh twaran' shabd vastut: nirarthak hai
 If 'absolute motion' had meaning, then it could be certain without referring to other bodies
 parantu sab prakaar se cheshtaa karne par bhi kisi pind kii 'nirpeksh' gati kaa pataa nishchit rup se prayog dwaara pramanit nahin ho sakaa he or ab to aapekshikta siddhant bataata he ki aisa nishchit karnaa asambhav he
 a new approach in physics started with relativity theory
 aapekshikta siddhant ke aane se bhautikee ke katipay puraane siddhanton kaa drudh sthaan dig gaya or anek moulik kalpanaaon ke vishay main sookshm vichaar karne kii aavashyaktaa dikhaai dene lagi
 In science, the function of theory is often to systematically formulate known fruits and then to test new fruits from that theory by experiment
 aapekshikta siddhant in donon kaaryon main safal rahaa he
 By the end of the 19th century, physics was developing according to Newton-inspired theories
 prayek nae avishkaar athwa praayogic fal ko in siddhanton ke drushtikon se dekha jaataa tha or aavashyak nai pariklpanaayen banaai jaati thim
 Among them, the ubiquitous ether had a distinctive place
 ether ke astitv kii kalpana karne ke do pramukh kaaran the
 Firstly, a medium like ether was required for the vibration of electromagnetic waves to propagate from one place to another
 dwitiya, yantriki main newton ke gati vishyak samikarnon ke liye, or jis parshwabhoomi par ye sameekaran aadhaarit the uske liye bhi, ek pramanik nirdeshak kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Specific properties were applied to the ether to accurately assess the fruits of the experiments
 ether sarvyaapee samajha jaataa tha or sampurna dishaao main tathaa pindon main bhi uskaa astitv mana jaataa tha
 In this stable ether, objects could travel without resistance, it was imagined
 in gunon ke kaaran ether ko nirpeksh maanak samajhane main koi baadha nahin thi
 Light speed 3x108 m
 Per second, it was known and waves of light are radiated at this speed relative to 'stationary' ether, it was imagined
 yantriki main veg, twaran, bal ityadi ke liye bhi ether nirpeksh maanak samajha jaataa tha
 In the second half of the 19th century, many attempts were made to experiment with the existence of ether and to establish its properties
 inamen micelsonmorle kaa prayog vishesh mahatvapurn tathaa ullekhneey he
 The purpose of this experiment was to make an accurate measurement of the speed at which the Earth revolves around the Sun with the ether
 kintu yah praytn asafal rahaa or prayog ke fal se yah anumaan nikaala gaya ki ether ke saapeksh prithvi kii gati shunya he
 It also means that the imagery of ether is untrue, that is, ether does not exist
 yadi ether hi nahin he to nirpeksh maanak kaa bhi astitv nahin ho saktaa
 Thus, the motion can only be relative
 bhautikee main saamanyat: gati kaa maapan karne ke liye athwa fal vyakt karne ke liye kisi bhi ek paddati kaa nirdesh dekar kaary kiya jaataa he
 But in these instructional methods, no method can be 'specific', because if it were, then we could consider that 'specific' instructional method as the standard of relaxation
 anek prayogon se aisa hi fal praapt hua
 The fruits of these experiments created serious disturbance not only in physics, but also in science and philosophy
 20veen shatabdi ke prarambh main prasiddh french ganitagya ech
 poincare ne aapekshikta kaa pranium prastut kiya
 According to them the laws of physics should be expressed in such a form that they are real to any observer
 iskaa arth yah he ki bhautikee ke niyam prekshak kii gati ke upar avlambit na rahen
 This act sheds new light on the prevailing conceptions of pain and time
 is vishay main oinstin kii vichaardhaara, yadhyapi vah krantikaarak thi, prayogon ke falon ko samajhane main adhik safal rahi
 Einstein made special analysis of the fundamental words and the prevailing conceptions combined with them, such as speed, acceleration, acceleration, time, etc
 is vishleshan se yah spasht hua ki newton ke siddhanton par aadhaarit tathaa pratishthit bhautikee main trutiyaan hai
 Einstein's theory of relativity is two categories: vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is swaroop main vyakt hote hai ki ve kisi bhi atwarit prekshak ke liye samaan honge
 In the general relativity theory, the laws of physics are expressed in such a way that they will be independent or unrestrained by the motion of the observer
 vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1905 main hua or saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1915 main hua
 It was presented by Einstein in 1905 in one of his papers on the electrodynamics of moving bodies
 vishisht saapekshata do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he jo shastreey yantriki ke sankalpanaaon ke viruddh hai: The results from the theory of specific relativity are surprising; Some of these are as follows: shastreey yantriki main galileo kaa roopaantaran prayukt hota he jabaki vishisht saapekshata main lorents roopantaran 
 The theory of relativity developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1911 is known as 'general Relativity'
 yah siddhanth nimnlikhit do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he- Specific relativity theory improved the assumptions made in physics about length, distance, time, mass, energy, etc
 inke atirikt bhautikee ke kshetra main anya vishay hai jo utane hi mahatvapurn hai, kintu unka samavesh vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main nahin he
 The specific relativity principle can be used in force and electromagnetic fields, as it cannot in the gravitational field
 gurutvkarshan bhautikee kaa ek atyant mahatvapurn vibhaag he, at: spasht he ki vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ko vyapak banane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The relation of mass comes in two ways in physics
 kisi pind par jab bal kaary karata he tab pind kaa sthaan badalata he or uskaa veg badalata he
 The body gets acceleration as long as the force acts
 yantriki ke niyamon ke anusaar bal, pind kaa dravyaman or twaran main nimnlikhit sambandh he : The mass m in this equation is called inertia or dependent mass
 dravyaman kaa doosraa sambandh newton ke guruttviya kshetra main aata he
 According to Newton's theory of gravity, if two masses, m1 and m2, are at a distance r, the following gravitational force f will work between them: is sameekaran main g gurutvkarshan sthiraank he
 If we consider m1 as the mass of the earth and m2 as the mass of another body near the earth, the equation will express the mass m2
 newton kii yantriki main gativigyaan tathaa gurutvkarshan swatantra or bhinn hai, kintu donon main hi dravyaman kaa sambandh aata he
 Einstein integrated the concepts used in these two independent and different divisions of the mass into his general relativity theory
 yah gyaat tha ki jadtv par ashrith dravyaman or gurutveey dravyaman samaan hote hai
 Einstein used this analogy of mass to harmonize kinetics and gravity, and in 1915 AD introduced a comprehensive relativity theory
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant ko ganit main sutrit karne kii jo paddati he vah anya paddatiyon se bhinn he
 It uses special geometry, which is different from Euclid's three-dimensional geometry
 ] ne yah bataaya ki yadi vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main dik ke teen aayam tathaa samay kaa chaturth aayam, in chaaron ayaamon ko lekar ek 'chaturaayam satati', kii kalpana kii jaae to aapekshikta siddhant adhik saral ho jaataa he
 Symmetry is not absolute - it has been proved
 isse newton pranit dik tathaa samay kii nirpekshata or swatantraaa samaapt ho jaati he
 Therefore, to express physical phenomena, the quadrant of time and time is more natural
 riman ne 'chaturaayam dik' kii kalpana karke uski jyamiti kaa jo vikaas kiya tha uskaa oinstin ne adhik upyog kiya
 In this quadrant of time and time, the principles of physics were geometrically placed in the general relativity theory
 is chaturaayam satati kaa yuclid ke teen aayam ke dik se samya he
 In the reality of three dimensions, just as a point or a place is determined by these three coordinates, the length between two points and one is also fixed
 chaturaayam satati main dik ke in teen ayaamon ke saath jab samay bhi joda jaataa he tab samay kaa aayam rup t = x0
5c-1 aata he, jahaan t = samay or c = prakaash kaa veg he
 If one observer specifies a world event, then the speed relative to that observer will be the coordinates of the same event for another observer
 lorenz ke roopantaran ke niyam yadi yatharth hon to siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki By developing the equation, similar but highly complex terms are found for any type of motion
 iske liye nishchalon or pradishon ke siddhanton kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Gravity naturally occurs in the wider relativity theory by expanding the original imaginations in this way
 uske liye vishisht pariklpanaaon kii aavashyaktaa nahin haati he
 The results of many events are the same, according to Einstein's pervasive relativity theory and Newton's pioneering mechanics
 kintu khagoliki main jab saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa upyog kiya gaya tab teen ghatnaon ke fal pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar nikle falon se kuch bhinn rahe
 From these fruits one can take the test of general relativity theory

 Tansen or Mian Tansen or Ramtanu Pandey was a great scholar of Hindustani classical music
 unhe samraat akbar ke navratnon main bhi gina jaataa he
 Music is famous for Emperor Tansen's city of Gwalior, saying that here children cry, they roll in tune and stones roll
 is nagari ne puraatan kaal se aaj tak ek se badhkar ek sangeet pratibhaayen sangeet sansar ko di hai or sangeet surya tansen inamen sarvopari hai
 How did Tansen gain knowledge of music? prarambh se hi tansen me dusron kii nakal karne kii apurv kshamta thi
 The child Tansen used to make true copy of dialects like animals and birds and used to scare people with the speech of violent animals

 Once Akbar asked Tansen to sing Deepak Raga, Tansen told him that the result of singing Deepak Raga could be very bad
 lekin akbar ne unki ek na suni
 So they had this raga gun
 unke gaate hi garmi badhane lagi or chaaron ore se maano agni kii lapten nikalne lageen
 The audience escaped from the heat, but Tansen's body started burning with intense heat
 uski garmi keval megh raag se samaapt ho sakati thi 
 It is said that Tansen's daughter Saraswati saved her father's life by singing the raga
 baad main akbar ko apane kiye par kaaphi sharminda hona padaa
 Pleased with the music of Tansen, Akbar included him in his Navratnas
 gwalior se lagbhag 45 kimi dur gram behat main shri makrand pandey ke yahan tansen kaa janm gwalior ke tatkaaleen prasiddh faqir hazrat mohammad gaus ke vardaan swaroop hua tha

 In the early period of Tansen, Gwalior was ruled by the artistic king Mansingh Tomar
 unke protsaahan se gwalior sangeet kala kaa vikhyath kendra tha, jahaan par baijubaavaraa, karn or mahmud jaise mahaan sangitacharya or gayak gana ekatra the or inhen ke sahyog se raja maansingh tomars ne sangeet kii dhrupad gayaki kaa avishkaar or prachaar kiya tha
 Tansen's music education also took place in this environment
 raja maansingh tomars kii mrityu hone or vikramajit se gwalior kaa rajdhikaar chhin jane ke kaaran yahan ke sangitagnon kii mandali bikharane lagi
 Then Tansen also went to Vrindavan and there he got higher education of music from Swami Haridas ji

 The Mughal emperor Akbar, hearing the praise of his singing, invited him to his court and placed him in his Navratnas
 akbar ke navratnon tathaa mogulakalin sangeetkaaron main tansen kaa naam param-prasiddh he
 Although Tansen's contribution cannot be said to be significant in terms of poetry, but in terms of the combination of music and poetry, which was a great feature of devotional poetry, Tansen is certainly notable in the history of literature
 tansen akbar ke navratnon main se ek the
 Once Akbar told him that he wanted to listen to the music of his guru
 guru haridas to akbar ke darbar main aa nahin sakate the
 So Akbar came to listen to music of Haridas in this fund
 haridas ne unhen krishna bhakthi ke kuch bhajan sunaae the
 Akbar was so impressed with Haridas that he went back and told Tansen alone that you are not even closer than your mentor
 phir tansen ne jawaab diya ki jahaanpanaah ham is zamin ke badshaah ke liye gaate hai or hamaare guru is brahmad ke badshaah ke liye gaate hai to fark to hoga na
 There is no consensus regarding the name of Tansen
 kuch kaa kahana he ki 'tansen' unka naam nahin, unakon mili oopaadhi thi
 Tansen was an original artist
 ve swar-taal main geeton kii rachana bhi karte the
 The three texts of Tansen are mentioned- 1
 'sangitsar', 2
 'ragamala' and 3
 'shriganesh stotra'
 Tansen's name will always remain immortal as Dhrupadkar in the history of Indian music

 With his inspiration, the child Tansen got music education from childhood
 swami haridas ke paas tansen ne baarah varsh kii aayu tak sangeet kii shiksha pai
 While there, he studied literature and music
 sangeet kii shiksha praapt karke tansen desh yatra par nikal pade
 He traveled to many places and he got a lot of fame on the performance of music, but there was no achievement of living worth
 ek baar vah reva ke raja ramchandra ke darbar main gane aae
 He had heard the name of Tansen but had not heard the singing
 us din tansen kaa gayan sunakar raja ramchandra mugdh ho gaye
 From that day onwards Tansen started living in Rewa and was given social and political honor with every kind of economic facility as a Raj singer
 tansen pachaas varsh kii aayu tak reva main rahe
 During this period he made his music practice seductive and elegant
 har ore unki gayaki kii prashansa hone lagi
 Abdul Fazal, one of Akbar's mentors and Navaratnas, wrote a letter to Akbar praising Tansen's music and suggested that Tansen should be the Navratna of the akbari-darbar
 akbar to kala-parkhi the hi
 By getting such a great musician, he got restless to beautify his court
 unhone tansen ko bulaava bheja or raja ramchandra ko patr likhaa
 But King Ramchandra was not ready to send such a Kalaratna to his court
 baat badi or yuddh tak pahunch gai
 And even after a lot of persuasion, Raja Ramchandra did not agree, then Akbar sent a small contingent of the Mughals Sultanate to bring Tansen forcibly, but there was a war between King Ram Chandra Judeo and Akbar's soldiers and all Akbar's soldiers were killed, Many soldiers of Rewa Raja were killed in this too! This angered Akbar and sent a large army and the king of Rewa again prepared for war, then Tansen came to the king of Rewa and pleaded not to fight, but the king was very stubborn
 And sent messages to Akbar's court that "if the emperor sends petition letters, i will send him to Tansen"
 Akbar did not want to fight with the Rajputs even on the smallest thing! Then Akbar sent the petition, then King Ramchandra Judeo gladly sent respectfully Tansen to Delhi and a great war was averted! chaand khan or suraj khan swayan na ga saken
 The contest finally started

 When all this is done, the act of reprimand or consolation is done using the duties of the Naturopath, who will clean the person suffering from ghosts by harmful liquids with the right kind of medicine
 dharm pustika tab kahati he: According to the Methodist Church, the ritual of exorcism involves "removing the objective power of the demon who has taken possession of a person"
 Additionally, the Methodist Church states that "the right of exorcism was given to the church in the form in which the ministry of Jesus is established in the world"
 The anointed pastor should first contact the District Superintendent in order to complete the exorcism

 Apart from this, the ministry of "bible, Prayer and Sacrament" should also be extended to these people
 in chizon kaa sammilan prabhaavshaalee siddh hua he
 For example, in one particular situation, a Roman Catholic woman believed that her house was haunted and so approached her pastor for help
 kyonki mahila ke ghar se bhuton ko bhagane ke liye vah uplabdh nahin tha, isliye mahila ne methodist purohit se sampark kiya, jisane ek kamare se buree atmaaon ko apsaarit kiya, jise ghar main chal rahe sankat kaa strot mana gaya or usee sthaan par holi communion kaa aayojan kiya gaya; is kriya ke baad ghar main phir koi samasya nahin rahi
 In the Pentecostal Church, the miraculous activity and other less formal parts of Christianity, the ritual of exorcism, have many forms and perception structures

 However, he notes that "they are not always right: their experience must be examined"
 In their examples, they are able to detect the events that led to the entry of the ghost, or they are able to find the evil object that has cursed the person

 It helps the ghost exterminator to know how the soul works in the life of a person with ghosts
 aatma dwaara vyakt lakshan or ghatnaon kii pushti, mukti ke baad peedit dwaara kii jaati he
 Exorcism is not always successful, and Jilata tells of another example in which the general methods had failed and the ghost later left the victim directly
 In one event, "in all cases the ghost is ordered in the name of Jesus, not someone else
" " The Christian practice of exorcism is for a person who is under the process of serious mental or physical disease and does not have the mental or physical causes of the disease before the official acceptance of the exorcism ritual
 Mental and physical therapists are appointed for confirmation
 jab saare sambhavit susadhy kaarnon ko khaarij kar diya jaae to maamle kaa upachaar ek asaadhya bhoot-baadha grastata ke rup main kiya jaataa he or is sthiti main bhoot-pret ke apasaaran kii kriya kii ja sakati he
 The experience of the symptoms of exorcism occupation works on people that the illusionary influence of illusion and the power of suggestion is attributed by some

 Harishankar Aadesh is a migrant Hindi writer from Canada
 bhugol main maatraatmak kranti After World War II, the emphasis on abstract theory and the creation of models began to be rejected by descriptive geography, and for this, statistical techniques were used extensively in geography
 As a result of the quantitative revolution in geography, objectiveness and scientific approach emerged
 The first method was the use of quantitative method in geography
 Quantitative revolution in geography can be divided into four stages, namely- 1
pratham avasthaa -is avasthaa main nidarshan takanic,madhya,madhyika,bahulak,maanak vichlan jaisi saral sankhyikee vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya gaya is avasthaa main bi je elberi, king,david harvey ,ecreman jaise vidwaanon kaa mahatvapurn yogadan rahaa
 2
 Second stage - In this stage statistical methods such as correlation, regression were used
 3
 tritiy avasthaa -is avasthaa main chorle,haget,mosar,scot aadi vidwaanon ne mahatvapurn yogadan diya is avasthaa main jatil sankhyikeey vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya gaya yatha - padausi sankhyikee tathaa bahuchar vishleshan aadi 4
 Fourth position - In this method aerial photography, computer, and remote sensing techniques are used on a large scale

 waterfol model ek anukramik software deveopment kii prakriya he jisamen iske vikaas kii prakriya ko avadharana, prarambh, vishleshan, dizin, nirmaan, pareekshan or anurakshan ke charnon ke madhyam se niyamit rup se neeche kii ore ke pravaah ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Template: Software development process waterfol deveopment ke model kii utpatti vinirmaan or nirmaan udyogon se hui he; ucch sanrachit bhautik vaataavaran jisamen parivartan karnaa agar naammumkin nahin he to bhi bahut mahangaa he
 Since the formal software development methodology did not exist at that time, this hardware-based model for software development was readily adopted
 waterfol model kaa sabase pehla aupchaarik varnan, praayah winston dablyoo
 royas dwaara 1970 main prakashit ek lekh se uddhrut kiya gaya he, haalanki royas ne is lekh main 'waterfol' sangya kaa prayog nahin kiya tha
 Royce offered this model as an example of a flawed and useless model
 aamtaur par prayog kiye jane vaale kisi software practice kii aalochana karne ke ek tareeke ke rup main — software deveopment ke bare main likhit rup main kisi sangya ko aamtaur par prayog karne kaa yahi vaastavik tarika he
 In Royce's original waterfall model, the following steps are sequentially followed: waterfol model kaa anusaran karne ke liye, vyakti ek charan se agle charan main purnataya anukramik tareeke se aage badhata he
 For example, the person first meets the requirements specification that is set in stone
 jab aavashyaktaaon ko puri tarah se puraa kar liya jaataa he, tab vyakti dizin kii taraf aage badhata he
 The questionable software is designed and a blueprint is prepared for the implementers to follow - this design needs to be formulated into a plan for the implementation of the given requirements
 jab dizin puri tarah se puri ho jaati he, tab kuta lekhak, us dizin ke karyanvayan kaa kaary karte hai
 Towards the later stages of this implementation phase, separately built software components are combined to introduce new functionality and reduce risk by removing errors
 is prakaar waterfol model is baat kaa anurakshan karata he ki vyakti ko agle charan kii ore tabhi badhanaa chahie jab pichhlaa charan puraa or siddh ho chukaa ho
 However, there are several modified waterfall models in which there are bound to be more or less variations in terms of this process
 software nirmaan chakra ke aarambh main bitaye gaye samay se baad ke charnon main adhik se adhik arthvyavastha kaa maarg prashast ho saktaa he
 It has been shown that bugs found in early stages are cheaper to fix in terms of money, effort and time than similar bugs found later in the process
 ek charan udhaaharan le, agar ek program dizin ko karyanvit karnaa asambhav ho jaataa he to maheenon baad iskaa ehsaas karne kii apeksha ise dizin charan main hi dizin ko fiks kar lenaa zyada aasaan hota he jab kaarykram ke ghatakon ko ekikrut kiya ja rahaa ho kyonki ek bekaar dizin ke kaaran ab tak kiya gaya sara kaam bighad jaataa he
 These are the main ideas behind the Big Design Up Front and Waterfall models - the time spent at the start of construction ensures that the requirements and design are exactly right and will save more time and effort later
 Thus, for those who follow the waterfall process, the idea is that before they move on to the next stage of program creation, one must ensure that each step is 100% complete and absolutely correct
 dizin shuru karne se pehle kaarykram kii aavashyaktaaon ko stone main set kar lenaa chahie ; isse pehle ki log dizin ke karyanvayan par kaam karnaa shuru kare, kaarykram kaa dizin purna hona chahie, ityadi
 Another argument for the waterfall model is that it also emphasizes documentation as well as source code
 kam dizin or pralekhan ke tareekon main, yadi team ke sadasyon ko chhod diya jaae, to zyada se zyada gyaan kho jaataa he or usase ubharne main pariyojna ko mushkil bhi ho sakati he
 a fully working design document should be present
 New team members or even completely new teams should be able to familiarize themselves by reading the documents
 uparokt ke atirikt, kuch waterfol model ko iske saral drushtikon ke kaaran bhi pasand karte hai or tark dete hai ki yah adhik anushaasit he
 Rather than what waterfalls view as anarchy, the waterfall model provides a structured approach; The model itself develops in a line in discrete, easily understandable and interpretive stages and thus is easy to understand; It also offers easily markable milestones in the development process
 aisa shaayad isliye hai kyonki waterfol model kaa prayog kai software ejineering granthon or paathyakramon main deveopment model ke ek aarambhik udhaaharan ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 It is argued that the waterfall model and the big design up front can generally be suited for software projects that are sustainable and where it is possible or likely that the designer can fully predict the system's problem areas
 Will be able to construct an accurate design before committing and implementing
 waterfol model main is baat kii bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he ki karyanvayankarta sunirmit, sateek bhang se purna dizin kaa anusaran kar or yah sunishchit kare ki system kaa ekikaran sucharu rup se aage bad rahaa he
 In the context of the waterfall model, many argue that this is a bad idea from the behavioral point of view
 aisa khaas kar unke vishwaas ke kaaran hota he kyonki ve sochate hai ki kisi bhi non-trivial pariyojna ke liye yah asambhav he ki vah agle charnon main jane or unase seekhney se pehle ek software product ke linesaaical ke ek charan kii purnataa ko praapt kar saktaa he
 For example, clients may not be well aware of what requirements they need before reviewing and commenting on a work prototype; They can change their needs continuously
 dizinron or programmeron kaa is par thodaa-bahut niyantran ho saktaa he
 If the client changes their requirements after the design is finalized, the design must be modified to accommodate the new requirements
 iskaa prabhavi bhang se yahi arth nikalataa he ki kaam karne ke adhikansh samay ko amaanya kar diya jaataa he jiskaa arth he ki laagat main vruddhi kar di jaati he, khaskar yadi pariyojnaon ke sansadhano kii ek bahut badi maatra ko big dizin ap front main pehle se hi niveshit kar diya gaya he
 Designers may not be aware of future implementation difficulties when writing the design of an unproven software product
 iskaa arth yahi he ki karyanvayan charan main yah spasht ho saktaa he ki kaarykram kii kaaryakshmata kaa ek vishesh kshetra asaadhaaran rup se karyanvit karnaa mushkil he
 If this is the case then it is better to modify the design than to continue using a design that was based on an incorrect prediction and which is no longer useful in the context of newly discovered problem areas
 karyanvayan ke dauraan vinirdesan ke aise parivartan ke bina bhi, yaa to scrtch, "on e green field" se nae SW pariyojna ko shuru karne, yaa kuch pehle se hi vidyaman, "e brown field" ko jari rakhane kii sambhaavna he
 The waterfall method can basically be used for the continuous growth of another team, even for the already existing SW
 jab system kaa analist, customer kii aavashyaktaaon ko sahi bhang se samajhane main vifal ho jaataa he to nimnlikhit charnon ke parinamit prabhaav ko abhi bhi is paddati dwaara vash main kiya ja saktaa he or is maamle ke saath-saath vyavhaar ke maamle main bhi yah ek QA team ke liye ek chunauteepurn kaam hota he
 In "managing the Development of Large Software Systems", the first paper describing the waterfall model, Dr
 Winston W
 Royce also described the general form of "risky and invites failure"
 code complit main steve mcconal ne dizin ko ek "viked problem" ke rup main sanderbhit kiya he — jo ek aisi samasya he jisaki aavashyaktaaon or seemabaddhataon ko sampoornataa se pehle puri tarah se gyaat nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The implication is that it is impossible to complete one phase of software development, thus using the waterfall model to move to the next phase
 "e rashnal dizin process: haau and whi tu phek it" main david parnas ne likhaa he: "many of the details are known to us only when we progress in implementation
 jin kuch chizon ko humlog sikhte hai ve hamaare dizin ko amaanya kar dete hai or hamalogon ko us par jarur nazar rakhana chahie
" Behind the waterfall model may also be the idea of "measure Twice; cut forests", and opposition to the waterfall model argue that this idea takes a different route when measured due to modifications in necessity and new concepts in the context of the problem itself
 The problem is constantly changing
 kuch "investment of main-time" ke rup main ek samaadhaan nikal saktaa he jiskaa uddeshy SW ko waapas ekasaath samekit karnaa he jiske liye kuch anbhavi developaron ko reffactoring par samay dene kaa aadesh diya jaataa he
 Another approach is to prevent these requirements by targeting modularity with interfaces, a predictive design
 shuddh waterfol model ke saath kathith samasyaon ke pratikriyaswaroop, kai sanshodhit waterfol modelon ko prastut kiya gaya he
 These models may address some or all of the criticisms of the pure waterfall model
 steve mcconal ne apni pustak, Rapid Development: Taming Wild Software Schedules ke "lifecycle planning" adhyay main kai alag-alag modelon ko sammilit kiya he
 While all software development models will include some similarities to the waterfall model, and since all software development models will include at least some of the steps used under the waterfall model, this section, along with those closest to the waterfall model, Will be related
 jo model, waterfol model main or aage ke matbhedon ko lagu karte hai, un modelon yaa moulik rup se bhinn modelon ke liye software deveopment kii prakriya main saamaanya jaankaree kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The Sashimi model was originated by Peter Degrace
 ise kabhi-kabhi "waterfol model vid overlaping fezez" yaa "da waterfol model vid feedback" ke rup main bhi sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 Since the phases of the sashimi model are overlapping, information on the problem sites can function during phases that are generally, in pure waterfall models, ahead of other phases
 udhaaharan ke liye, chunki dizin or karyanvayan ke charan, saishimi model main ativyapee hote hai, isliye deveopment prakriya ke dizin or karyanvayan charan ke dauraan karyanvayan kii samasyaon kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 This helps mitigate many problems related to the philosophy of the Big Design up front of the waterfall model

 jeevwad yaa sarvatmavaad vah darshanik, dharmik yaa aadhyatmik vichaar he ki aatma na keval manushyon main hoti he varan sabhi jantuon, vanaspatiyon, chattaanon, prakritik parighatnaon main bhi hoti he
 Going further than this, sometimes the words, names, analogies, metaphors, etc
, also speak of the existence of the soul

 There are often three types of beliefs or ideas prevalent among humans regarding soul, soul or organism
 kuch log to charvak ke anuyaayiyon kii tarah, shariron se swatantra yaa pruthak jeevon yaa atmaaon kii koi satta hi nahin maanate
 According to him, consciousness arises as a result of the actions of the root brain in the same way as bile from the liver; It is not a quality or form of a non-material element or substance called a creature or soul
 iske viruddh kuch logon ke vichaar main chetana bhautik tatwon se utpann nahin hoti, kintu bhautik padaarthon se vilakshan aatma yaa jeev kaa gun he
 For example, Jain thinkers, while acknowledging the independent existence of organisms, defined the organism in these words as "chetnlakshano Jeeva:"
 parantu aatma yaa jeev kii satta sweekaar karanevaale sab vyakti ek mat ke nahin
 They can be broadly divided into two classes
 ek to ve jo keval manushyon or kuch ucch koti ke pashupakshiyon main hi aatma kaa astitv sweekaar karte hai or duusare ve jo na keval manushyon or pashupakshiyon main hi apitu keet-patangon or ped-paudhon aadi main bhi, jinhen duusare log jad samajhate hai, aatma yaa jeev ke astitv par vishwaas karte hai
 This same type of belief or idea of human beings is called animism
 taarkik bhashaa main sarvatmavaad vah siddhant he jiske anusaar tathakthith jad padaarthon main bhi aatma yaa jeevatma namawale ek abhautik tatv yaa shakti kaa astitv sweekaar kiya jaataa he or use na keval buddhijivi praaniyon ke bauddhik jivan kaa apitu shaareerik athwa bhautik kriyaaon kaa bhi muladhar mana jaataa he

 real and earth Shri Adi has also believed in the existence of soul in movable roots
 at: unhen sarvatmavaadi vichaar kaa samarthak kaha ja saktaa he
 In fact, in trees, planets, subconscious, even unconscious things, people who believe in the power of soul or organism are still found in many countries, such as the cow of the world, which are often not only of spirits, especially of their dead ancestors, but of such souls
 They also worship people whom they do not understand as related to any particular body or object or to the deity of natural substances or arrogant deities

 aadhunik yug ke adhikansh vichaarak sarvatmavaad ko na keval bahu-ishwarwad kaa hi kintu susabhy maanav ke dharmik akeshwarwad kaa bhi aadharbhoot vishwaas samajhate hai or uski gananaa asabhy yaa ardhsabhy jatiyon ke dharm yaa darshan main karte hai
