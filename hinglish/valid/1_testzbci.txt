 varg jeevvaigyanik vargeekaran main jeevon ke vargeekaran kii ek shrenee hoti he
 In modern biological classification, this category falls above the counters and below the associations, that is, there are many classes in a class and many classes are organized into a phylum
 dhyaan den ki har jeevvaigyanik varg main bahut si bhinn jeevon kii jatiyaan-prajatiyaan sammilit hoti hai
 The names of the biological classes are mostly in Latin language because the practice of biological classification started in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries and was considered the language of Latin knowledge at that time
 yah rivaayat abhi tak chalati ai he
 The classification system used in the modern period was made by a Swedish scientist named Carl Linnaeus in the 18th century
 tej gendbaazi ko pes bowling ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he jo cricket ke khel main gendbaazi ke do pramukh prakaaron main se ek he
 The second type is spin bowling
 tej gendbaazi karne vaale khiladiyon ko aksar tej gendbaaz, fastman, pes bowler, yaa pesamen kaha jaataa he, haalanki kabhi kabhi tej gendbaazi kii vishesh takanic kaa prayog karne vaale gendbaaz ko swing bowler yaa seem bowler bhi kaha jaataa he
 The main objective of fast bowling is to push the hard ball of the cricket at a high speed and give it such a speed that it can bounce on the pitch with the bounce or get out of the side in the air, so that the ball is clean for the batsman
 Be hard to hit
 ek praroopik tej gati se daali gayi gend kii gati 136 se 150 kilometre / ghanta hoti he
 The unofficial record of the fastest ball ever cast is recorded at 101
9 mi / h in the name of Pakistan's Mohammed Sami, the ball was bowled in a match against India
 adhikarik rup se darj kii gayi sabase tej gati se daali gayi gend kii gati 161
3 kilometre prati ghanta thi or yah gend 2003 ke cricket vishwa cap main england ke khilaaf ek match ke dauraan pakistan ke shoeb akhtar ke dwaara daali gayi thi
 The batsman to play on this ball was Nick Knight, who hit the leg side
 haalanki baad main brett lee kii ek gend kii gati bhi itani hi paayi gayi, parantu radar ke sanketon main bahari hastkshep ke kaaran ise thik tareeke se darj nahin kiya ja sakaa tha
 Two back-up radars recorded a perfect speed of 142 km / h for this delivery
 adhikansh cricket deshon main, tej gendbaazon ko team kii gendbaazi kaa mukhya aadhaar mana jaataa he, jabaki dhime gendbaaz sahaayak bhoomika nibhaate hai
 The opposite is often true in the subcontinent, especially in India and Sri Lanka, where fast bowlers play the right role for the spinner
 aisa kaaphi had tak in deshon main prayukt pich kii sthiti ke kaaran hota he, jo tej gendbaaz kii tulana main spinner ke liye adhik sahaayak hoti he, lekin antarrashtriya str par spinner ke vishisht kaushal kii tulana pes bowler se kii jaati he
 In contrast, the other main subcontinent, Pakistan, has had many skilled fast bowlers, as this country specializes in reverse swing and pitches here are more helpful for fast bowlers
 aisa sambhav he ki ek gendbaaz keval gati par dhyaan kendrit kare, vishesh rup se ek yuva gendbaaz ke liye yah sach he, parantu jaise jaise tej gendbaaz paripakv hota jaataa he, vah or bhi kai kaushal hasil kar letaa he or swing gendbaazi yaa seem gendbaazi kii taraf uskaa rujhaan badhane lagata he
 gendbaaj adhikansh tej gendbaaz in donon main ek kshetra main visheshgy hote hai or kabhi kabhi inhen strike, swing yaa seem bowler main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 However, this classification is not satisfactory because the gradation is not mutually exclusive and a skilled bowler usually puts a mixture of fast, swing, seam and cutting balls, regardless of one type of preference over the other
 iske bajaay, tej gendbaazon ko unki delivery kii ausat gati ke anusaar vargeekrut karnaa adhik aam he, jaisaa ki neeche diya gaya he These words are used on the basis of context; For example, Cricinfo uses the terms "fast-medium" and "medium-fast" interchangeably
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki sabase tej gendbaaz express gati se gend daalate hai
 For comparison, most spin bowlers in professional cricket bowl at an average speed of 45 to 55 meters per hour
 kuch gendbaaz tej se dhimi har prakaar ke gend badlaav ke saath daalate hai, isse kuch bhram utpann ho saktaa he kyonki unhen bhinn shreniyon main rakhaa ja saktaa he, udahaaran ke liye brett lee apni tej gend ko 145 kilometre pati ghanta kii gati se daalate hai, jo unhen ek tej gendbaaz banaata he, haalanki ve kabhi kabhi lagbhag 120 kilometre prati ghanta kii gati se dhimi gend bhi daalate hai
 Conversely, Anil Kumble is a spin bowler, he bowls relatively fast, having a speed of 110 kilometers per hour
 haalanki ek gendbaaz koun si shrenee main feet baithta he, iskaa nirdhaaran karne ke liye in aankadon par aksar dhyaan nahin diya jaataa he, kyonki gend daalane kii gati main badlaav hote rahete hai, iske peeche mukhya iraadaa hota he, ballebaaz par prahaar karnaa, naaki gendbaazi kii ek maanak gati nirdhaarit karnaa
 The slower the fast bowler, the more he has to rely on the change techniques given below to take wickets
 jabaki tej or ek had tak tej-madhyam or madhyam-tej gendbaaz aksar apni ugrata or gati ke dwaara ballebaaz ko out kar dete hai
 In practice, very few specialist bowlers fall into the medium range - bowlers bowling at this pace are often batsmen who can bowl a few overs when needed
 in gendbaazon medium pesar kaha jaataa he
 Spin bowlers are often placed in the medium-slow and slow-medium categories, as a ball bowled at this speed with the technique of fast bowling is often much easier to hit than spin
 haalanki spinner ko bolchaal kii bhashaa main "dhime gendbaaz" kaha jaataa he, peshewar cricket main bahut kam khiladi vastav main "dhimi" shrenee main gend daalate hai The first thing a fast bowler needs is to hold or grip the ball correctly
 buniyadi tej gendbaazi main adhiktam gati praapt karne ke liye gend ko is tarah se pakadaa jaataa he ki seem sidhe upar kii ore ho or sanket anguli tathaa madhyam anguli ko seem ke sheersh par ek duusare ke paas rakhaa jaataa he or angootha seem ke bilkul neeche hota he
 The image to the right shows the correct hold
 pehali do anguliyaan or angootha gend par grip banaata he, yah hissaa shesh haath se thodaa aage kii ore hota he or shesh do anguliyon ko hatheli ke saath chipka kar rakhaa jaataa he
 The ball is caught very lightly, so that it is easily released from the hand
 anya prakaar kii grip bhi sambhav hai, iske parinamswaroop kuch alag tarah kii gend daali jaati he- neeche dekhen swing or seem gendbaazi
 gendbaaz aamtaur par ek haath se gend par grip banaata he or duusare haath ko is haath par adhiktam sambhav samay tak rakhe rahata he, taaki ballebaaz yah naa dekh paae ki vah kis prakaar kii grip le rahaa he, yaa lene kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 a fast bowler needs to run longer towards the wicket than the spinner
 yah lambi daud tej delivery ke liye gend main ek samveg utpann karti he
 Fast bowlers identify the distance from the wicket and measure the distance required for this race
 gendbaaz ke liye yah jaananaa bahut mahatvapurn hota he ki uski daud kii thik lambaai kitni hogi, kyonki ise popping kris par khatm karnaa jaruri hota he
 If the bowler goes beyond this crease, then the ball put by him falls in the category of no ball
 ran-ap yaa daud ke ant main gendbaaz apane agle pair ko pich par rakhata he, is samay jahaan tak ho sake use apane ghutane ko sidhaa rakhata hota he
 This helps to speed the ball but it can be dangerous because this action puts pressure on the joint
 ghutane kii chotein tej gendbaazon main asaamaanya nahin hai: udhaaharan ke liye, english pes bowler david laurence, ke ghutane kii cap ke do hisson main tut jane ke baad main kahi maheenon tak khel se baahar ho gaye
 The pressure on the front foot is so high that some fast bowlers cut the front of their shoe to prevent injury to their toe, as they have to repeatedly press against the shoe
 iske baad gendbaaz apni gendbaazi vaali bhujaa ko apane sir se upar uthaata he or ke upyukt unchai par le jaakar gend ko chhod detaa he, jahaan use lagata he ki gend ko daalaa janaa chahie
 Once again, the arm must be straight, although this is a rule of cricket rather than aiding in increasing speed
 kohni ko mode kar gend daalane se gendbaaz ke liye aasaan ho jaataa he ki vah sidhe ballebaaz ke wicket par prahaar kare or use out kar de
 Fast bowlers perform actions that leave them side-on or chest-on at the end of the run-up
 ek chest-on gendbaaz kii chaati or kulhe us samay ballebaaz kii or jhuke hote hai jab uskaa pichhlaa pair jameen ko choota he, jabaki ek said- on gendbaaz kii chaati or kulhe us samay ballebaaz kii disha main 90 degree par jhuke hote hai, jab uskaa pichhlaa pair jameen ko choota he
 West Indies bowler Malcolm Marshall was a good example of a chest-on bowler, while Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee used the side-on technique
 haalanki ek gendbaaz kaa ection gend kii gati ko prabhavit nahin karata, lekin yah unke dwaara daali jane vaali gendon kii style ko simit kar saktaa he
 Although there are no set rules and laws for this, side-on bowlers usually bowl outside when they swing outward, while front-on bowlers bowl inward
 tej gendbaaz ke ection kaa ek or prakaar he, sling, isamen gendbaaz jab gend kii delivery kii shuruuaat karata he, uski bhujaa puri tarah se uski peeth ke peeche kii ore faili hui hoti he
 The sling generates excessive speed, but has to compromise control
 sling ke saath gend daalane vaale sabase prasidd gendbaaz hai, jaiff thomson, jo ek chota ran-ap lete hue bhi asaadhaaran gati se gend daalate the
 Current international players who bowl with Sling include Fidel Edwards, Sean Tate, Lasith Malinga and Mitchell Johnson
 jab gend daal di jaati he, gendbaaz apane ection ke ant main "pholo thru karata he
 In this, the bowler runs a few steps to slow down his pace and comes out of the pitch while on the side
 delivery ke ant main pich se baahar aate samay gendbaaz sataha ko kshatigrast kar saktaa he, jisase pich par asamtal ptch ban jate hai, spin bowler aksar gend ko zyada ghumaane ke liye aisa karte hai; aisa karnaa khel ke niyam ke anusaar avaidh he
 Those bowlers who continue to run on the pitch can be warned that in a game, the bowler is unable to bowl again during that innings when three such warnings are received
 ek prabhavi tej gendbaaz ko ek susangat line or length bana kar rakhni hoti he, yaa saamaanya shabdon main kaha jaye to use bilkul sateek hona chahie
 is sandarbh main, line kaa sandarbh ballebaaz kii ore gend ke path se he, jab vah of se leg said kii ore kshitij aayam main daud rahaa he
 Whereas length refers to the distance that is set before the ball bounces in the batsman's direction
 ek tej gedbaaj ke liye aksar length zyada mahatvapurn hoti he
 The faster the bowler is, the more difficult it is for him to maintain the line and length, but the faster the ball can be thrown
 ve tej gendbaaz jo is drushti se bilkul sateek hote hai, ve atyant prabhavotpadak hote hai, udhaaharan ke liye, australian tej gendbaaz glen mekagra or dakshin africa tej gendbaaz shaun polok In modern cricket, the line intended for the fast bowler is so-called indefinite; This is the area just outside the batsman's off stump
 ballebaaz ke liye yah bataanaa mushkil hota he ki aisi gend unke wicket se takaraayegi yaa nahin or is prakaar se vah yah nahin jaan paata ki bachane ke liye gend ko chhod diya jaye yaa ise hit kiya jaye
 is takanic ko saidhantik rup se of theory kaha jaataa tha, lekin ab yah itani niyamit he ki ise shaayad hi kabhi koi naam diya jaataa ho
 beshak, line main badlaav bhi mahatvapurn he or leg stump par daali gayi delivery uddeshy ko puraa karti he
 Accurate mastery of the line of the ball is best used when a batsman is known to have the weakness to hit a particular shot, because the bowler who is putting the ball along from an effective line is right after the weakest time Can put the ball
 ek nishchit line par gend ko lagaataar hit naa kar paane ke kaaran asankhya ballebaazon kaa karier khatm ho jaataa he, jab ve kushal line gendbaazon kii gend par out ho jate hai
 a good length ball is one that is at the height of his waist when reaching the batsman
 ek acchhee length ke liye koi nirdhaarit duuri nahin he, yaa vastav main cricket main gend ke liye koi anya length nahin he, chunki aavashyak duuri gend kii gati ke anusaar alag alag hoti he, isi tarah se yah duuri pich kii avasthaa or gendbaaz tathaa ballebaaz kii oonchai par bhi nirbhar karti he
 It should be noted that bowling a "good length" in this sense is not always appropriate — in some situations, on some pitches and for some batsmen another length may be effective
 daayin ore diya gaya chitra is baat ko spasht karne main madad karegaa ki alag alag length kaa kya taatpary he
 a ball that bounces just before the good length and rises higher than the batsman's stomach is called a short pitch ball or is described as a long hope and hit it for the batsman
 Easier because he gets more time to see if there is a disturbance after the ball height and line bounce
 ek chote pich kii gend ballebaaz ke liye sahi oonchai par hoti he, kyonki vah is par ek aakraamak pul shot laga saktaa he
 a ball that bounces before a good length and reaches shoulder or head height is called a bouncer and can be an effective delivery
 koi bhi gend jo itani short hoti he ki ballebaaz ke sir ke upar bouns ho jaye, use aamtaur par ampaire ke dwaara wide kaha jaataa he
 Putting a short pitch ball or a wide ball is not considered good as it makes it easier for the batsman to defend or attack
 scale ke duusari ore, vah gend jo acchhee length ke bajaay ballebaaz ke paas aakar bouns hoti he, use phul pich yaa over pich kii gend kaha jaataa he yaa ise hof voli ke rup main bhi varnit kiya jaataa he
 Instead of a good length, it is easier for the batsman to play these balls as they do not have much time to move after being bounced from the seam
 ballebaaz ke ke pair ke najadik daali gayi gend yorker kehalaati he, agar ise thik prakaar se daalaa jaye to yah bahut prabhavi length he
 If the ball does not bounce before reaching the batsman, it is called a full toss
 ballebaaz ke liye is prakaar kii delivery ko khlena bahut aasaan hota he, kyonki yah pich se bouns naa hone ke kaaran apana rasta nahin badalati
 isiilie teen prabhavi length ) ko hit karnaa ballebaaz ke liye aasaan hota he, kyonki leth par niyantran tej gendbaaz ke liye bahut mahatvapurn he
 Spin bowlers, on the other hand, always aim for a good length, but they have to control the flight of the line to make the line effective
 ek tej gendbaaz apane puure cricket karier main shaareerik rup se feet rahane kii koshish karata he, yah avadhi ek dashak se adhik ho sakati he
 It is needless to say that this is very difficult to do and it also requires good luck with great discipline
 strike gendbaazi ek aise prakaar kii gendbaazi he jisamen gendbaaz gend ko hawa main daalane yaa pich ke baahar daalane ke bajaay tej gati or ugrata ke saath ballebaaz ko out karne kaa prayaas karata he
 These techniques are usually successful against the top batsmen only when the fast bowler has the ball in the fast or fast-medium range
 dhime gendbaaz kabhi kabhi hi in takneekon kaa prayog karte hai, vishesh rup se ant main khilne vaale ballebaazon ke khilaaf in takneekon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, parantu aksar yah takanic ulti padati he or ballebaaz ran lene main safal ho jaataa he
 However, aggressive bowling techniques can be used jointly with the bowling swing or seam technique so that the bowler can bowl any speed that is not possible to play
 Inswinging yorkers are considered particularly fatal
 bounsar ek aisi gend hoti he jise pich ke pehle aadhe hisse main daalaa jaataa he, taaki iske baad iske paas itnaa samay ho ki yah tezi se uthe or ballebaaz tak pahunchane tak uski chaati yaa sir kii oonchai tak pahunch jaye
 isse ballebaaz ko do tarah kii samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 If he tries to play it, the bat will be at the level of his eye so that he will not be able to see the ball while putting the shot and it will be difficult for him to play this shot
 agar vah ise chhod detaa he to yah uski chaati yaa sir par prahaar kar sakati he or kabhi kabhi use chot bhi lag sakati he
 For this reason, a bouncer is also known as Intimidatory Bowling
 ek bounsar ke liye ballebaaz kii saamaanya pratikriya hoti he ise neeche dak kar dena, lekin iske liye teevr sajagata or pratikriya kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or kabhi kabhi gend ballebaaz ko hit kar jaati he
 Attempting to save your head by straightening the bat is a normal reaction in this situation, but it should not be done if possible because doing so returns the ball to an uncontrolled angle and can be easily caught is
 adhikansh ballebaaz dehshat se bhar jate hai or apana wicket kho dete hai, is tarah se kai ballebaazon ke karier par pratikul prabhaav padaa he
 a physically powerful batsman often hits such a ball when it is moving, even if he cannot see it, as this is not uncommon, in this situation due to the combined speed of both the speed of the ball and the batsman's bat
 She goes out of the boundary
 yahaan is baat kii sambhaavna bhi hoti he ki wicket keeper is gend ko rokane kaa prayaas karata he, isliye ek kushal ballebaaz ke liye yah gend ranon ke lihaaj se mahangi pad sakati he
 a slow ball is a ball which is thrown at normal speed in terms of action and run-up and its grip is lightly altered to reduce its speed
 isse ballebaaz ko dhokhaa ho jaataa he, kyonki vah tej gati kii gend ko khilne kii taiyaari main hota he, achaanak gend kii gati kam ho jane ke kaaran uske shot kaa samay gadabada jaataa he
 This usually results in the ball hitting the bat and moving downwards and the bat speed slowing down
 se takaraati he, isliye urja kaa sthaanantaran ho jaataa he or gati kam ho jaati he)
 saath hi, jab balla gend ko hit karata he, us samay vah thodi si gati kar chukaa hota he or apane chaap ke upari hisse main hota he, jiske kaaran gend balle se alag hone ke baad ek bade kone par laut jaati he
 This combination results in a slower catch ball, a relatively easy catch
 kisi kisi maamle main, ballebaaz is shot ko itnaa jaldi khel jaataa he ki clin bold ho jaataa he
 One of several types of grip is shown on the right
 anivaary rup se antar keval itnaa he ki madhyam or sanket anguli ek duusare se dur ho gayi hai or neeche kii taraf seem ke donon ore aa gayi hai
 Due to this, when the ball is out of hand, it tends to stretch more and the delivery speed decreases
 dhimi gendon ko of spinner ke dwaara of brake grip or finger ection kaa upyog karte hue bhi daalaa jaataa he
 Sometimes a slow ball can be bowled using a leg spin grip and wrist action or by supporting the upper part of the ball with just one finger
 dhimi gend aksar us ballebaaz ke khilaaf prabhavi hoti he jo tezi se score bananaa chaah rahaa he
 As a result, its effectiveness with one-day cricket has increased and is particularly beneficial towards the end of an innings when the batsman is aggressively trying to score
 ek adhik anbhavi ballebaaz mid-stroke ko samyojit kar letaa he, is samay vah gend ko balle ke middle se hit karata he
 Another type of slow ball is called slob
 ise keval sheersh anguliyon se daalaa jaataa he
 Its purpose is to insert a "beamer", this type of delivery delivers the ball awkwardly and reaches the yorker length
 yah aksar kris kairns ke dwaara kris red ke liye daali gayi genden hoti thim, jisase phul length main dak ho jaataa tha or stump ud jate the
 a yorker is a ball that bounces on the pitch right in front of the batsman's feet, this area is called a block hole
 ballebaaz ke saamaanya rukh kii vajah se or cricket ke balle kii niyamit lambaai ke kaaran balle ko aamtaur par us samay bhoomi ke paas nahin rakhaa jaataa, jab ballebaaz gend ko strike karne kii taiyaari kar rahaa hota he
 So to play the yorker, the batsman must immediately change the height of his bat, as soon as he is aware that the bowler has inserted the yorker
 yah mushkil hota he or aksar gend bich ke antaraal se nikal jaati he or wicket ko tod detii he
 Successfully playing this type of delivery is called digging out a yorker
 yorker daalane ke liye atyant sateek gendbaazi kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, kyonki agar ise bahut lanbaa daal diya jaye to phul toss ho jayega yaa phul pich delivery ho jaaegi, jise khelnaa ballebaaz ke liye aasaan hota he, kyonki gend bina bouns hue balle tak aa jaati he
 This is known as a surprise ball
 is do kaarnon se, adhikansh paristhitiyon main yorker saamaanya rup se daali jane vaali delivery nahin he
 In the final stages of an innings in one-day cricket, batsmen try to hit every ball
 aisi paristhitiyon main, yorker vishesh rup se ek prabhavi delivery hoti he
 In this time it helps in taking wickets and prevents the ball from reaching the boundary
 isliye, in paristhitiyon mereksar yorker daali jaati he, aisi paristhiti main ve gendbaaz jo yorker daal sakate hai, puraskaar ke kaabil hote hai
 The seam of the ball is used in seam bowling in such a way that it bounces unexpectedly when it hits the pitch
 ek acha ballebaaz is baat kaa purvanumaan laga letaa he ki gend kahaan par bouns hogi or isse use is baat kaa andaja ho jaataa he ki jab gend us tak pahonchegi tab uski unchai kya hogi
 bouns main main badlaav paidaa karke, gendbaaz is baat kii sambhaavna utpann karata he ki ballebaaz apane anumaan main galati kar baithe or apana wicket kho de
 Seam delivery can be bowled at any speed, but bowlers who put seam balls bowl at medium, medium-fast or fast-medium
 seem gendbaazi kii mul takanic he, saamaanya tej gendbaazi yaa dhimi gend kii grip or yah sunishchit karne kaa prayaas ki seem hameshaa sidhi khadi avasthaa main bani rahe jab tak gend pich se takaraa na jaye
 If the seam is upright and the ball is spinning on its horizon axis, no appreciable magnus effect will occur and the ball will not move in the air
 The seam of the ball is raised and produces a change in bounce and speed if it is the first part of the ball to hit the pitch
 seem gendbaaz vishesh prakaar kii pichon se kaaphi phayda uthaa sakate hai
 a tight pitch that has a severed surface is best for seam bowling, because the ball bounces more easily without losing its momentum due to the hardening of the pitch, while the surface bumps unexpectedly due to unevenness
 , When she hits the pitch
 ise veriable bouns kaha jaataa he
 Sometimes a very strict and uneven pitch is declared dangerous to play as the batsman cannot make any predictions about the ball and as a result the chances of the ball being hit on his body repeatedly
 hari pich bhi seem gendbaazon ke liye sahaayak hoti hai, kyonki ghaas ke chote chote guchchhe asamtal sataha kaa kaam karte hai, haalanki iskaa prabhaav mishrit hota he kyonki hari sataha gend ko dhimaa bhi kar detii he
 Seam bowlers are not effective on a highly flattened and flat surface, and seam bowlers often use aggressive bowling tactics and / or bowling cutters on such a surface
 kattar shabd kaa istemaal ek tej gend ke varnan ke liye kiya jaataa he jo spin ho rahi he
 This is a type of delivery that revolves around the opposite axis rather than keeping the seam straight
 haalanki is prakaar kaa ghurnan spin gendbaazi jitna phydemand nahin hota, phir bhi isse utpann hone vaale chote badlaav ballebaaz ke liye asuvidhajanak ho sakate hai, aisa gend kii gati ke kaaran hota he
 The cutter seam is an effective method for the bowler
 agar unhen pich se adhik sahaayta nahin mil rahi he to ve gend kii is prakaar kii gatiyon se phayda uthaa sakate hai
 The rotating ball around the seam moves to the right or left when it hits the pitch, depending on which side the ball is spinning
 daayin or bouns hone vaali gend of kattar kehalaati he kyonki yah ek daayen haath ke ballebaaz ke liye of stump se leg stump kii taraf jaati he
 In contrast, the ball bouncing left and right is called a leg cutter as it moves from the leg stump to the off stump for a right-handed batsman
 kattar ko aamtaur par isliye daalaa jaataa he taaki ve ballebaaz ke of stump ke thik baahar pich ko hit kare or wicket se dur chali jaye
 This will cause the ball to hit the outer edge of the bat instead of hitting it, and it will increase the chances of getting caught on returning
 ek kattar prakaar kii gend daalane ke liye gendbaaz ek alag prakaar kii pakad yaa grip kaa upyog karata he
 Two types of right and grip are shown, the top one producing the leg cutter while the bottom one produces the off cutter
 isi tarah se grip badalane ke liye, gendbaaz ko apni anguliyon ko gend ke said main neeche kii taraf laana hota he, taaki gend ko chhodte samay usamen aavashyak spin utpann kiya ja sake
 kattar gendbaazi main gend par khinchaav bad jaataa he or gend kii gati ek dhimi gend kii tarah kam ho jaati he or isse bhi ballebaaz ko bhram main daalane main madad milti he
 The swing bowler, unlike the seam bowler, puts the ball in the air, not putting it off the pitch
 saamaanya yaa paaramparik swing gendbaazi gend kii seem ko uthaa kar kii jaati he or paaramparik swing aamtaur par us samay sabase zyada hota he jab gend nayi hoti he or isliye isamen spasht seem hota he
 As the ball becomes old, it becomes difficult to swing, but it can be done if the fielding team polishes one side of the ball in a manner and the other side is left without polish
 When one side of the ball is heavily polished and the other side is dropped and inserted quickly, it produces a reverse swing that causes the ball to swing in the opposite direction as in a conventional swing
 lokapriy raay ke vipareet, yah swing isliye utpann nahin hota he kyonki khurdari said kii tulana main hawa chikani yaa "chamakili" said ke upar se tezi se pravaahit hoti he
 The swing is caused by a net force acting on the ball from one side; That is, the side whose boundary layer is more turbulent
 paaramparik swing gendbaazi ke liye, uthaayi gayi seem or jis disha main ise uthaaya gaya he, swing kii disha ko nirdhaarit karte hai
 Due to the angular seam of the ball, the air flowing over the seam produces turbulence on this side, the side on which the seam is twisted
 isse duusari said kii tulana main taral seemaa parat gend kii sataha se alag ho jaati he jahaan lemina kii parat seemaa pehle alag ho jaati he 
 isse ek shuddh dabaav kaa antar utpann ho jaataa he is prakaar se shuddh bal gend ko koniya seem kii disha main gati detaa he or use swing karata he
 Traditional swing bowling is delivered with a seam angle so that the smooth and polished surface of the ball faces to the front, moving the ball in the direction of the seam ie the rough surface
 ek swing karti hui gend ko out swinger kaha jaataa he, agar yah ballebaaz se dur chali jaati he, yaa ise inaswinger kaha jaataa he, agar yah ballebaaz kii taraf jaati he
 In most cases the outswinger is called a more dangerous ball, because if the batsman does not recognize it, it hits the outer edge of the bat instead of hitting it and it is a win slip, it can be easily caught at this stage
 Can
 inaswinger kaa bhi apana mahatva hota he, vishesh rup se tab jab yorker ke saath sanyukt avasthaa main hoti he, kyonki inaswinger balle ke aantarik kinare se takaraati he or wicket ko tod detii he, yaa balle ke bajaay ballebaaz ke pad se takaraati he, jiske parinamswaroop elbeadblyoo kii sambhaavna ho jaati he
 Swing bowling can be broadly classified into an early swing or a late swing, depending on when it changes its direction during its trajectory curve - the later the swing the ball
 As it happens, the probability of the batsman adjusting their shot according to the swing is reduced
 swing gendon ko bhi usee grip or takanic ke saath daalaa jaataa he, jis grip or takanic kaa prayog tej gendbaaz main kiya jaataa he
 However, instead of keeping the seam straight, it is tilted lightly at an angle and a slower grip of the ball can be used
 ek outswinger ke liye gend kii chamakili said ballebaaz ke najadik hoti he or seem uske vipareet disha main kone par jhuki hoti he, jabaki inaswinger ke liye, khurdari said ballebaaz ke najadik honi chahie or seem kaa jhukaav uski ore hona chahie
 ek kattar grip ke saath swing mushkil hota he, chunki gend udaan ke dauraan spin hoti he, khurdari yaa chamakili main se koi bhi sataha ballebaaz ke saamne kii taraf aa sakati he, kyonki yah hawa main udaan bhar rahi hoti he
 Many players, commentators and fans in the game agree that the ball can be swinged more easily in damp or overcast conditions, as well as to be used in Test cricket than the white ball used in one-day matches
 The red ball of the ball swings more
 reverse swing ek aisi ghatana he jiske kaaran gend vipareet disha main swing hoti he
 When the ball is reverse swing, the ball swings to the bright side
 paaramparik swing kii tulana main reverse swing thoda baad main hota he or adhik tezi se hota he, donon hi kaarak ballebaaz kii mushkil ko badha dete hai, jo gend ko hit karne kii taiyaari main hota he
 Reverse swing depends more on conditions than normal swing, so it is almost impossible to achieve it consistently
 aamtaur par reverse swing tab tak nahin hota jab tak gend ko lagbhag 45 over tak kaam main na liya ja chukaa ho or iske liye garm or shushk mausam kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The technique of reverse swing was first discovered by Pakistani bowlers in the 1980s but since then it has spread to all cricket playing countries
 reverse swing main khurdari sataha ko aage ore rakhaa jaataa he
 The seam is tilted at the same angle as in the traditional swing but the boundary layer is turbulent on both sides
 seem or khurdari sataha kaa shuddh prabhaav yah hota he ki gend vastav main us disha ke vipareet swing hoti he jis ore swing mudi hui he
 Good reverse swing bowling requires that the bowler deliver the ball at a very high speed, this speed can be achieved only by the few fast bowlers in the world
 ab, ek divasiy cricket main 35 over ke baad gend ko badalanaa anivaary he, aisa reverse swing ko kam karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 In this way, it is mandatory for the fielding team to change the ball after 35 overs and hence there is no reverse swing
 dippar ek swing karti hui gend he jise yorker yaa phul toss daalane ke iraade se daalaa jaataa he, parantu yah gendbaaz ke chunaav ke vipareet dippar main badal jaati he
 indipper moves towards the right-handed batsman while outdipper moves away from him
 prabhavi hone ke liye, ek dippar main bahut adhik swing hona chahie, taaki uski gati main bhinnata utpann kii ja sake, kyonki gend pich par bouns nahin ho rahi hoti he
 However, because the batsman usually expects it to be easy to score on a full toss, the dipper is a surprise ball and can be very difficult to play especially if the bowler is very precise and is successful in putting the yorker instead of a full toss
 Let it happen
 ugr yaa aakraamak gendbaazi, gendbaazi kii vah ranneeti he jisamen gendbaaz ballebaaz ko gend se hit karne ke iraade ke saath gend daalata he
 This is to some extent against the rules of cricket, including rules that do not allow excessive use of bouncers, it also does not allow the use of a "beamer", which aims to completely hit the batsman's head
 Have to do
 safal aakraamak gendbaazi main aamtaur par bounsar or short pich delivery kaa mishran hota he, jise ballebaaz ke sir, chaati or pasaliyon ko lakshya banaakar daalaa jaataa he
 The main intention behind this is to divert the batsman's attention so that he makes a mistake and loses his wicket
 aksar wicket kisi bounsar yaa short pich kii gend par nahin girtaa, balki iske bajaay saamaanya delivery par wicket gir jaataa he, jisaki ballebaaz ummid nahin kar rahaa tha, yaa ballebaaz apane saamaanya tareeke se khilne main asafal ho jaataa he 
 It has a prominent approach behind it, aiming at the batsman's chest, licking several short pitched balls, forcing the batsman to defend himself by elevating the bat and playing on the back foot, followed by a fast yorker
 In which the base of the stump is targeted
 agar ballebaaz balle ko unchaa karke pichley pair par khilne kii taiyaari karata he, gendbaaz apni taiyaari ke liye jitna samay letaa he, vah ballebaaz ko dehshat main daalane ke liye paryaapt hota he or is prakaar se vah apana wicket kho saktaa he
 a fast bowler can also bowl aggressively to anger or tease the batsman, in which he bowls the ball aiming at the batsman
 aakraamak gendbaazi kaa upyog har tej gendbaaz ke dwaara alag alag ansh tak kiya jaataa he or yahaan tak ki kabhi kabhi sarvshereshth ballebaaz bhi isamen gambhir rup se ghayal ho jaataa he or khel se baahar jane ke liye majaboor ho jaataa he
 In almost all cases verbal 'abuses' are also attacked with it
 acchhee shrenee ke tej gendbaazon ke dwaara aakraamak ranneeti kaa atyadhik upyog khel kii bhaavana ke anuroop nahin mana jaataa or kai tiimon or khiladiyon ke dwaara iska virodh kiya jaataa he
 An example of its excessive use was the Bodilyn series, in which the then English cricket captain Douglas Jardine attacked the bowling attack of Donald Bradman, the star player of the Australian cricket team
 isamen ve bahut tej or short genden daal rahe the, ballebaaz ke sharir ko lakshya bana rahe the, iske peeche unka iraadaa unhen vyaktigat rup se chot pahunchaana tha
 Several rules of cricket were changed after the Bodilyn series to prevent the use of such tactics in future
 Many fielders who used this type of strategy were banned
 kyonki lagbhag sabhi cricket tiimon main bhinn gati or style ke kai tej gendbaaz hote hai, tej gendbaazi kii takanic na keval maidan ke saath badalati he balki gendbaaz ke saath bhi badalati he
 This technique also changes with the sequence of balls inserted
 sateek ranneeti kai karkon par nirbhar karti he, in karkon main khel kii avasthaa, pich kii avasthaa, mausam or saapeksh urja or gendbaazi karne vaale bhinn khiladiyon kii kushalta kaa str shaamil hai
 Fast bowling requires a lot of energy, most fast bowlers are expected to rest after bowling for four to six overs simultaneously
 Depending on the circumstances, they may need to bowl longer than this, but this usually reduces their effectiveness and makes the bowler tired
 kis prakaar kii gend daali jaayegi or gendon ko kis kram main daalaa jayega, iskaa chunaav khud gendbaaz par nirbhar karata he
 Most sides have a mixture of fast bowlers who specialize in furious and / or seam techniques, and some bowlers specialize in swing
 jab gend nayi hoti he yah aamtaur par bahut kam swing hoti he lekin yah atyadhik gati, bouns or kai prakaar kii seem kaa pradarshan karti he 
 That is why seam bowlers are chosen to bowl with the new ball, seam bowlers are given the opportunity to bowl when the innings begins, or when a new ball is brought during the game
 kshetrarakshan paksh ko 80 over puraani gend se khilne kaa vikalp bhi diya jaataa he
 Conversely, swing bowlers are more effective when the ball starts to reverse swing
 reverse swing gendbaaz 80 over se bhi adhik puraani gend main atyadhik gati utpann kar sakate hai
 Two seam bowlers are usually expected in tandem after the first 10 overs, after which time the ball starts to swing and either or both of them are given the opportunity to swing or spin bowling
 yahi kaaran he ki adhikansh timen kam se kam do seem gendbaaz rakhti hai, jinhen opening gendbaaz kaha jaataa he
 With the old ball, seam bowling usually becomes ineffective and becomes almost useless after 60 overs and as a result, the team should also have spin bowlers with swing
 ek tej gendbaaz kaa kshetrarakshan aamtaur par ugr prakaar kaa hota he, is drushti se aisa kaha ja saktaa he ki iskaa uddeshy wicket lenaa hota he naaki ballebaaz ko ran baanne se rokna
 Occasionally, especially when fielding teams bat later and are trying to score goals, protective fielding is required
 ek saamaanya niyam ke anusaar surakshatmak tej gendbaazi karnaa mushkil kaam he- yah kaam spin gendbaazon ke liye behatar hota he
 Various fast bowling techniques can dismiss a batsman in three ways
 ve yaa to gati ke saath bold yaa elbeadblyoo kiye ja sakate hai, yorker yaa seem yaa swing ke dwaara gend ko ballebaaz kii taraf daalaa ja saktaa he, is sandarbh main kshetrarakshak kii niyukti apraasangik he
 The swing or seam can be used to push the ball away from the batsman, in which case the ball will hit the outer edge of the bat and can be caught during the flight
 ek buree tarah se khelaa jane vaala bounsar yaa to bahari kinare se takaraata he yaa upar chalaa jaataa he yaa iske parinamswaroop shot khilne kaa samay gadabada saktaa he or ise boundry ke paas kaich kiya ja saktaa he
 For this, the most effective fielders for aggressive fast bowling are deployed in the outfield and slip cordons and gullies, as the batsman is most likely to be caught in these situations
 outfield main kshetrarakshakon ko tainaat karne kaa atirit phayda hota he, isse ballebaaz ke liye un sthanon kii sankhya kam ho jaati he, jahaan vah boundry main ran score kar sake
 Other close fielding conditions such as silly mid on / off and many midwicket situations are usually unnecessary
 iske vipareet, tej gendbaazi ke liye ek rakshaatmak kshetra ballebaaz ke chaaron or kai sthitiyon ko pack kar detaa he jaise gulii, point or puraa sarkal
 One or two slips and one or two outfielder remain in the catch position
 kyonki aamtaur par ballebaaz jameen par shot lagane kii koshish karata he taaki kaich ke jokhim se batch sake, is prakaar ke kshetrarakshan main puure field ko itnaa band kar liya jaataa he ki agar ballebaaz ek prayaas bhi kare to use ran out kiya ja sake
 Defensive fast bowling is a difficult task because a skilled batsman is prepared for this type of technique and scores runs from the boundary when he hits the midwicket ring or away from an existing outfielder
 kisi bhi gendbaaz kaa praathmik lakshya hota he, ballebaaz kaa wicket lenaa
 The second goal is to stop him from scoring runs
 The second one often paves the way for the first one, because when the batsman does not know how to score runs, he gets upset and tries to put a risky shot to score
 iske alaava, aamtaur par ballebaaz ko ran banane se rokane ke liye ek gendbaaz lagaataar ek hi ballebaaz ke liye genden daalata he, use kisi prakaar ke takneekee anukram kii sthapana kaa avasar detaa he
 Accordingly, consistently bowling the wicket is not an appropriate approach for a fast bowler, as it gives a clear and easy response to the batsman
 ballebaaz apane wicket ko bachaa letaa he or buree gend kaa bhi saamana kar letaa he
 Another approach behind this is to create uncertainty by bowling a line and length, so that the batsman is not able to decide whether to attack or defend himself
 In a mixed type of delivery, the batsman does not get what the next ball will be like
 ek acchhee gendbaazi main adhikansh genden aamtaur par swing yaa seem hoti hai, jo qamar kii unchai tak aati hai, of stump ke baahar aakar ballebaaz se dur chali jaati hai, kyonki yahi vah kshetra he jahaan ballebaaz ke liye sabase uchit pratikriya dena mushkil hota he
 Common variations and their strategies are discussed below
 ek over ke dauraan gendbaaz ke dwaara chuni sateek genden match kii sthiti par nirbhar karti hai, ye ballebaaz kii kushalta par bhi nirbhar karti hai, saath hi is baat par bhi nirbhar karti hai ki ballebaaz kitni der se kris par tikaa hua he
 It is easy to attack the batsman who has just come to the wicket, he can be attacked with the help of a bouncer and short pitch to get him out and prevent him from sticking to the offensive batting for long
 
 short genden us ballebaaz ke liye jokhim bhari hoti hai, jo kris par tik chukaa he, kyonki ve aasaan boundry lete hai, lekin adhikansh gendbaaz phir bhi mishrit genden daalate hai, taaki ballebaaz anumaan lagane kaa prayaas karata rahe
 Most batsmen try to take a front or back foot shot and this affects the bowler's choice of ball
 short gend ko front foot par khelnaa mushkil hota he isliye gendbaaz us ballebaaz ke liye short gend ko praathamikta dete hai, jo front foot par kheltaa he
 Similarly, the yorker and full pitch ball are difficult to play on the back foot so this type of delivery is used for back footed batsmen
 agar ek gendbaaz safaltaapurvak ballebaaz ke vipaksh main is prakaar kii gende lagaataar daalata he, vah achaanak vipareet prakaar kii gend daal kar ballebaaz ko hairaan kar saktaa he-kai short pich ke baad ek yorker yaa kai phul gendon ke baad ek bounsar
 jo ballebaaz acha prekshak nahin hota vah aisi sthiti main anjaane main apana wicket kho detaa he
 Another variation, especially for a batsman who has stayed on the wicket and is starting to run independently, is to change the attack line from just outside the off stump and bowl directly to the leg stump
 ballebaaz ko is prakaar ke gendon ke liye uchit pratikriya kerani hoti he kyonki yaa to vah ran le saktaa he yaa elbeadblyoo ke jokhim par hota he, parantu jab vah aisa karata he uskaa balla leg said ke upar aata he or of said ko asurakshit chhod detaa he
 If the bowler can generate enough speed on the off side with swing or seam technique, it often hits the outer edge of the bat and starts directly on the stump
 yah yaad rakhana chahie ki gendbaazi main hairaan karnaa ek bada avyav he, gendbaaz aksar ballebaaz ko bhram main daalane ke liye in aam ranneetiyon kaa upyog karte hai, taaki vah galat shot lagaaye
 For example, putting the yorker on a new batsman who was expecting a bouncer, or at least the standard line and length ball, gets many bowlers out for the first ball
 maanav kaa sharir tej gendbaazi kaa boj nahin le saktaa
 Fast bowling causes great pressure on the entire body, especially on the legs, back and shoulders
 isamen sharir ke bahut se hisse chot ke jokhim main aa jate hai
 There is a possibility of fracture of the ankle, because when the foot falls on the ground at the time of delivery, there is a lot of pressure on it
 peeth main spasm or strain kii sambhaavna hoti he kyonki gend kii delivery ke samay sharir ko ek chaap main ghumaya jaataa he
 There is a possibility of rupture of the tendon muscle because there is a sudden jerk on the shoulder just before the ball is inserted
 ye chotii ke tej gendbaaz hai jinhone june 2009 tak isisi khiladiyon kii ranking main kam se kam 850 point banaaye hai

 Situated on the southernmost western coast of the mainland of India, this city was described by Mahatma Gandhi as the evergreen city of India
 tiruvananthapuram kaa sandhiviched he: tiruvananthapuram = thiru+ anant+ puram Tiru is a South Indian diabolical initial whose Hindi parallel is Sri
 anant bhagwaan anant ke liye hai tathaa sanskrit shabd puram kaa arth he ghar, vasasthaan
 It literally means Lord Eternal's abode

 In addition to this, some people use the long form, ie, Thiruvananthapuram instead of Harsva Ukaar, which is impure both in terms of transliteration and pronunciation
 dakshin bhartiya bhashaaon main t ke swar ko angrezi main Th se likhaa jaataa he, kyonki ise t likhane se, t kii maatra ke saath vibhed nahin ho paata he
 But many people transliterate this English word into Hindi and write it as "thiruvananthapuram" but it is wrong

 bajirao dwitiya, san 1796 se 1818 tak maratha samrajya ke peshwa the
 During his time the Maratha Empire began to decline
 inke shasankaal main angrejon ke saath sangharsh shuru hua
 Bajirao II was the eighth and last Peshwa
 vah raghunatharav kaa putr tha
 Bajirao II always hated his Prime Minister Nana Fadnavis
 naanaa fadanvis kii mrityu ke baad vah swayan hi maratha samrajya kii satta sambhaalanaa chahta tha
 Bajirao II was a queer and treacherous man, who obtained the rank of Peshwa with the help of the British
 parantu angrezon ke saath bhi vah sachcha siddh nahin hua
 Due to his deception and dishonesty, the British sent him captive to Bithoor, where he died in 1853 AD
 bajirao dwitiya ne angrezon se mitrataa karke unki sahaayta se 'peshwa' kaa pad praapt kiya tha or uske liye kai maratha kshetra angrezon ko de diye
 Bajirao II was a selfish and inept ruler and, being ambitious, was jealous of his prime minister Nana Fadnavis
 fadanvis kii mrityu 1800 i
 main ho gai or bajirao swayan hi satta sambhaalane ke liye aatur ho uthaa
 But he was devoid of military virtues and queer personally and believed that only through deceit could be achieved his goal
 naanaa fadanvis kii mrityu ke baad uske rikt pad ke liye daulataraav shinde or jaswantraav holkar main pratidwandvita shuru ho gai
 Bajirao II wanted to keep these two under his control by deceit, which further complicated the matter
 shinde or holkar ne peshwa ko apane niyantran main lene ke liye puna ke phatakon ke baahar yuddh shuru kar diya
 Bajirao II supported Shinde, but Holkar's army defeated the combined forces of both of them
 bhaybheet peshwa bajirao dwitiya ne 1801 i
 main basai bhagkar angrezon kii sharan lee or vahiin ek angrezi jahaaz par basai kii sandhi, 31 disambar, 1802 par hastakshar kar diye
 By this he accepted to be a dependent of the East India Company
 angrezon ne bajirao dwitiya ko rajdhani puna main pun: sattashin karne kaa vachan diya or peshwa kii raksha ke liye usne rajya main paryaapt sena rakhane kii zimmedaari lee
 In return, the Peshwa agreed to give so much Maratha territory to the company, which brought the expenses of the company's army
 usne yah bhi vaayada kiya ki vah apane yahan angrezon se shatruta rakhane vaale anya europea desh ke logon ko naukari par nahin rakhega
 Thus, Bajirao II sold his freedom to the British for his protection

 dodhia • khond • bhoi • rathva • Hakim Abul Qasim Firdausi was a Persian Persian poet
 unhone shahnamaa kii rachana kii jo baad main faras kii rashtriya mahakavy ban gai
 In it, he wrote about Iran before Arabic Fatah on Persia in the seventh century
 firdausi kaa janm 920 i
 main khurasaan ke toos naamak kasbe main hua
 a poet named Asadi taught him and inspired him towards poetry
 usne iran ke puranic raajaaon ke sambandh main use ek granth diya jiske aadhaar par firdausi ne shahname kii rachana kii
 It has 60,000 lions
 vah 35 varsh tak is mahaan kaary main vyast rahaa or 25 farvari 1010 i
 ko ise puraa kiya
 He was 85 at this time
 usne yah kavy sultan mahmud gazanvi ko samarpit kiya jisane 999 i
 main khurasaan vijay kar liya tha
 He was given only 20 thousand dirhams
 firdausi ke tan badan main aag lag gai
 He ran away from his country towards Hirat, but before fleeing, he added a poem to the Shahnama, which strongly condemns Sultan Mahmud
 shahname main firdausi ne iran ke puranic baadshahon kii, jinke karnaamon se vah atyadhik prabhavit tha, badi kii prashansa kii he
 His poetry reveals his love for ancient Iran and hatred for the Arabs
 sabhavat: kattar musalamaanon ko santusht karne ke liye usne baad main yusuf julykha naamak masanvi likhi jise bavahid shaasha bahauddaula tathaa uske putr sultanuddaula ko samarpit kiya
 He then returned to his homeland Tus and died there
 uski qabr iran ke darshneey sthanon main he
 It is said that as his janaza was leaving the gate of a nearby village, a caravan arrived with 60,000 dinars sent by Sultan Mahmud, whose poet had hoped
 firdausi kii putree ne samast dhan, daan punya main laga diya
 Very beautiful illustrated manuscripts of the Shahnama are preserved in large museums of the world

 Subsequently several editions were published from India and Iran
 sansar kii anek bhashaaon main iske anuwaad chap chuke hai
 Mahmud Ghaznavi is said to have pledged to Firdausi that he would give a dinar for every word of 'shahnama'
 varshon kii mehnat ke baad jab 'shahnamaa' taiyaar ho gaya or firdausi use lekar mahmud gazanabi ke darbar main gaya to samraat ne use prayek shabd ke liye ek dinar nahin balki ek dirham kaa bhugtan kara diya
 It is said that angry at this, Firdausi returned and did not even take a dirham
 yah vaayada kilaafi kuch aisi thi jaise kisi kavi ke prati shabd ek rupee dene kaa vachan dekar prati shabd ek paisa diya jaye
 Firdausi angrily wrote a few lines against Mahmud Ghaznabi
 ve panktiyaan itani prabhaavshaalee thi ki puure samrajya main fail gayin
 a few years later, his trusted ministers requested Mahmud Ghaznavi that Firdausi be paid at the same rate that was fixed
 samraat ke kaaran poochne par pradhanmantri ne kaha ki ham log samrajya ke jis kone main jate hai hamen ve panktiyaan sunne ko milti hai jo firdausi ne aapke viruddh likhi hai or hamaara sirf shame se jhuk jaataa he
 If he is given money at the prescribed rate, then we will get a lot of moral strength
 ' samraat ne aadesh de diya
 When a car full of dinars reached Firdausi's house, Firdausi's funeral was coming out from inside the house
 puri umr garibi, tangi or mufalisi main kaatane ke baad firdausi mar chukaa tha
 It is said that his girl, the only child of Firdausi, refused to take this paddy
 is tarah samraat kavi kaa karjadaar rahaa or aaj bhi he
 Perhaps this is the reason why Firdausi's Shahnama is as famous today or more famous as the lines that Firdausi wrote while criticizing Mahmud Ghaznabi
 firdausi kaa 'shahnamaa' darasal iran kaa itihaas hi nahin irani asmita kii pahchaan he
 It describes the achievements of ancient Iran
 samraaton kaa itihaas he
 The ancient Persian texts have been incorporated and given a new look
 myth or itihaas ke sammishran se ek adbhut prabhaav utpann hua he
 There are excellent examples of love, rebellion, valor, wickedness, humanism, war, courage that have made the 'shahnama' the immortal masterpiece of Iranian literature
 irani sahitya main 'shahnamaa' jitani tarah se jitani baar chapa he utana or koi pustak nahin chhapi he
 Firdausi has created characters like Rustom and Sohrab which have become part of human memory

 Dominic "dam" Cobb and Arthur call themselves "the Extractor", an intelligence organization using an experimental military technology to penetrate the inner core of their 'target' and share information about each other through their shared dream experiences
 Let it out
 unka haalia torget, saito naam ke ek japani bijnesaman he
 But during the reign of Sayto, he fails in his dream by interfering with the memories of his dead wife's mail
 lekin saito ke mutabik vah mahaj unako parakh rahaa tha, taaki vah kisi or aamuk ke antarman main ek idia "ijad" karne laayak mushkil kaam ko anjaam de sake
 He has a sickly competitive Maurice Fisher who is an integrated owner of energy production; Sayto wants Cobb to take advantage of the altercation between the fissure and his foster son, Robert Fischer, and spread his father's company
 iske badale main, saito vaayada karata he vah apni takat ke dam par kaab par lage hatya ke iljam ko mitaa degaa, taaki kaab apane bacchon se milane vaapis ghar ja sake
 The cab approves the proposal and gathers his team, out of which he: Aimes, a vicious thug and fraudster Bahrupia; Yusuf, a chemist who has an extremely fast drug that increases the ability to see "another dream within a dream"; Ariadne, an architecture student who is tasked with creating labyrinth-like creations during his dreams, is recommended by Professor Stephen Miles, the father-in-law of the cab
 saito, team kii kamyaabi tak aashwast rahane ke liye unase judaa rahata he
 But when Ariadne tries to peek into the cab with shared dreams, she realizes that Mel often attacks the interrupter inside her
 vahiin sidney main marish fiqar ke intkaal hone baad rabart fiqar unhen las angeles main antim sanskaar karaane ke liye unhen das ghanton kii udaan ke raste le chalate hai, kaab apni team ke saath is maukey par gambhirtha banaae rakhane or fiqar ke saajhe sapane main har mumkin yojana kii ruparekha taiyaar kar leti he
 To get back into almost every level in the fold of dreams, all those members need almost the same "shock" to wake them up from deep sleep
 yojana ke mutabik pehle level par yusuf pul se car ko giraata he, duusare level main arthur alevator kaa sahaara letaa he or tisare level ke aakhir main ams, visphot ke jariye sabko ekasaath baahar nikaalata he
 But despite dying in the dream world, he will not be able to wake up from the effects of the fast medicine from which he had consumed to maintain dreams of countless levels for a long time
 yahaan maut kaa anjaam se ve "limbo" yaa lagbhag coma jaisi sthiti main funs jaaenge, jahaan antarman kii aseemit va anant khaiyaan hogi jinase batch nikalnaa behad mushkil he
 At the bottom of the first dream, the team enters Yusuf's rainy Los Angeles via a dream
 yahaan team fiqar ko agava karne pahunchati hi he, lekin uski bachaav pranali main uske rachit angrakshak vahaan pahunch golabari kar saito ko jakhmi kar daalate hai
 Taking the form of Uncle Peter Browning, the father-in-law of Aim Fisher, at a safe destination, Robert advises Robert to revisit his father's wealth
 aakhir main team yusuf ke saath vine par, un barigards se bachate hue bhaag nikalati he, is darmyaan team ab duusare level main daakhil hone ko taiyaar ho jaati he
 Here, under Arthur's second dream hotel, the cab then convinces Fischer that it is his Uncle Browning who conspired to kidnap him and that he knows this as an inner-security expert
 kaab use agle level main jane ke liye browning ke antarman main jane ko raji karata he 
 In the third fold, they reach the fortress, situated amidst the snowy hills of Ames
 yahaan kaab kii team tukdon main bantakar prahariyon ko hataakar andar ghusane kii koshish karti he taaki fiqar ke antarman tak talmail bitha sake
 Yusuf, following his first level, drops from the bridge while driving the car and soon starts the first blow
 isse arthur ke level par se gurutv hat jaataa he jiske vajah se ams ke level par barf sarakane lagati he
 Ames immediately prepares to recover from the shock simultaneously before hitting the van's water
 lekin kaab ke projection main mail tab fiqar ko goli maar detii he, tathaa gambhir rup se jakhmi saito dam todate hi, donon hi us anishchit si duniya main gum ho jate hai
 Amidst this, Aimz puts explosives in place in the preparation of the shock, the cab and Ariadne then go into a coma to find Fisher and Sayto
 kaab tab tak ariadne ko uske va mail saath saajhe-sapanom ke jariye limbo main jane bare main bataata he
 Where both of them had spent almost fifty years creating the world with their memories
 lekin mail ne vaastaviktaa main lautne se inkaar kar diya, kyonki kaab ne anachaahe main uske man main yah soch daal di ki uski duniya sach nahin he, or yahi uski shuruaati sabak ne aakaar liya tha
 However, when she woke up from sleep, Mel began to believe that she was not in the real world
 apni asli duniya main "jaagane" ke liye, vah khudakhushi kar leti he, jiske liye vah kaab ko bhi saath marane kii jabardastee karti he
 To escape the murder charge, Cobb absconds from the US, and assigns the babysitting to Professor Miles
 is kusur ko kaboolne ke saath, kaab apane praayshchit main safal hota he, or antarman se rachi mail ko vah sukun se vidaa karte hue saito ko dundhane us antim antaheen duniya main chalaa jaataa he
 Ariadne also awakens the fisherman by shocking him
 fiqar dubaara us pahari durg main jinda hota he, jahaan ke sef room ko paakar, usamen maujuud marate hue pita ke jariye us idiye ke liye prerit karnaa he: jisamen uske pita use apni tarah banane ko kehete hai
 On the other hand, apart from Kaab and Sayto, all the other members return to reality with different shakes at the same time: like Ariadne's jump on the balcony, the explosives of Eames that destroy the fort, Arthur is asleep in the elevator through the blast The team is woken up by a collision, and the van also collides with the surface of the water
 kaab aakhirkaar us antarim duniya main umradraj ho chuke saito ko paakar, uske ekararnaame kii yaad dilaataa he
 The two then wake up in the same plane where the rest of the team and Robert Fischer had already woken up
 las angeles ke hawaondde par, america apravas jaanch centre main kaab ko nikasi milti he or intjaar karte uske sasur uske bacchon ke paas le jate hai
 The cab lays a small lanyard on the table, which he had put in place to verify the single dream, but leaves it and heads to the garden with his family

 Semiconductors are those materials whose electrical conductivity is less than conductors but greater than conductors
 silicon, jarmenium, cadmium sulphide, gallium arsenid ityadi ardhchaalak padaarthon ke kuch udhaaharan hai
 In semiconductors, there is a 'band gap' between the conduction band and the valence band, which varies from 0 to 6 electron-volts
 
 Most semiconductors used to make electronic devices are elements of group IV of the periodic table, compounds of groups III and V, antimonide), or compounds of groups II and VI

 The main purpose of conducting these tests was to tell the world that they were able to give a face-breaking answer to the strategic competence of the neighboring countries
 apni suraksha ore bachaav karne ke lie ve aatmanirbhar the
 Developed countries opposing these tests in India had forgotten that India had one nuclear test in 1974 and five in 1998
 jab ki iske pehle puure vishwa main 2052 parmaanu pareekshan kiye ja chuke the
 Out of these, America has conducted 1032 such tests since 1945
 is ke atirikt soviet sangh rup ne 715, france ne 210, britain ne 457 or china ne 44 parmaanu pareekshan kiye hai
 It is often said about Pakistan and Israel that they also have the capability of nuclear testing and news of nuclear testing can be received from them at any time
 bharat ke kul paanch mukhya parmaanu pareekshan he
 They can be mainly divided into four categories
 ye chaar tarah ke parmaanu pareekshan kiye hai - vikhandaneey bam yaa fishan divaais bam: yah permanu bam banaaye jane ke liye kiya gaya saamaanya pareekshan tha jisaki kshamta san 1974 main kiye gayi pareekshan ke samaan arthath 15 kilo ton thi
 Low-capacity explosion or low-yielding device: Its capacity is considered below 10 kg Un ie unit limited to kg capacity
 is pareekshan kaa ek uddeshy aanse aankde praapt karnaa tha jis se aage jaakar prayogshaala main computer aadhaarit pareekshan kiye ja saken
 Hydrogen Bomb Examination or Thermo Nuclear Device: It is also known as Super Bomb today
 isaki vinaashak kshamta saamaanya parmaanu bam kii tukna main so se hajaar guna taka adhik he
 Measuring the explosive capacity of a nuclear bomb in kilo tons, while measuring the capacity of a hydrogen bomb in megawatts
 sab kilo ton parikshan bharat me 13 may ko punah do parikshan kiye gayi
 These tests were sub-kiloton or less than one kiloton
 is parikshan ke baad yah daawa kiya gaya he ki in se bharat main computer anukaran ev prayogshaalaon main kiye jane vaale apkrantik parikshan kii kshamta praapt karliche he
 Today there are about 60 thousand nuclear weapons in the world, which will take at least 20 to 25 years to destroy
 nirastrikaran ke falswarup keval 10 hajaar parmaanu hathiyaar hi nasht ho sake
 It is clear from this that the threat of nuclear weapons will remain
 isliye bharat ne apni aatmaraksha ke liye yah prayaas kiya he
 Testing of atomic bombs in India When countries like China and America got hydrogen bombs, they started creating an organization to show bigotry to the world and started opposing the nuclear programs started by other countries
 china ne bharat par dadagiri dikhaani shuru kar di jisase bharat ko bhi hydrogen bam banane kaa dabaav padaa
 Subsequently, India started making atomic bombs under the secret mission and on 11 May 1998 successfully tested the hydrogen bomb in the government of Atal Vihari Vajpayee
 bharat sarkaar ne kisi bhi desh ko is pareekshan kii khabar tak nahin lagane di or jaise hi pareekshan kiya gaya, puri duniya main koharaam much gaya
 At that time, India was also criticized in the same way that North Korea is being today
 united nesan ne bharat par sabhi tarah ke aarthik pratibandh laga die jiskaa khamiyaja atal bihari vaajapeyi ko bhugatna padaa or bharat ke aarthik vikaas ko kaaphi nuksaan hua lekin uskaa phayda yah hua ki china ne ham par dadagiri dikhaani band kar di
 Today, India is developing faster than China
 bharat ke alaava pakistan or israel bhi hydrogen bam rakhane kaa daawa karte hai lekin israel ne aaj tak kisi bhi parmaanu bam kaa pareekshan nahin kiya he or pakistan ke pareekshan main wo dhar nahin thi jo ek hydrogen bam main honi chahie

 paaritantr yaa paristhitik tantra ek prakritik ikai he jisamen ek kshetra vishesh ke sabhi jeevadharee, arthath paudhe, jaanavar or anujiv shaamil hai jo ki apane ajaev paryaavaran ke saath antarkriya karke ek sampoorn jaivik ikai banaate hai
 Thus ecosystems are a unit of interdependent components that divide the same habitat
 paaritantr aamtaur anek khaadya jaal banaate hai jo paristhitiki tantra ke bheetar in jeevon ke anyonyashray or urja ke pravaah ko dikhaate hai
 The term ecosystem was coined in 1930 by Roy Clapham to denote the combined physical and biological components of an environment
 british paristhitivigyaanshasri arthur tansle ne baad main, is shabd ko parishkrut karte hue yah varnan diya "yah puri pranali


 na keval jeev-parisar he, lekin vah sabhi bhautik karkon kaa puraa parisar bhi shaamil hai jise ham paryaavaran kehete hai"
 Tansley considered ecosystems not only as natural units, but also as "mental isolates"
 tansle ne baad main "ecotope" shabd ke prayog dwaara paaritantron ke sthanik had ko paribhaashit kiya
 The main idea of the ecosystem concept is that living organisms influence every other element in their local environment
 ujin odum, paristhitiki ke ek sansthaapak ne kaha:" ek ikai jisamen sabhi jeev shaamil hon jo bhautik vaataavaran ko prabhavit karen ki pranali ke bheetar urja kaa ek pravaah spasht rup se paribhaashit poshan sanrachana, biotic vibhinnata or saamagree chakra ek paristhitiki tantra he
 "the human ecosystem concept is then based on the interpretation of human / nature bifurcation and on the basis that all species are ecologically integrated with each other and with the biotic organisms of their biotopes
 biom ek paristhitiki tantra ke samaan he jisamen ek mausami or bhugolic drushti se paribhaashit kiya gaya paristhitiki samaan jalwaayu paristhitiyon ke kshetra jaise ki paudhon, pashuon ke samudaayon or mitti avyav ke rup main aksar paaritantr ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 Biomes are defined based on factors such as plant structures, leaf type, plant spacing, and climate
 ichosone ke asmaan, biom, vargeekaran, anuvanshik yaa aitihaasik samanthaayen ke aadhaar par paribhaashit nahin kiya jaataa
 Biomes are often identified with particular samples of ecological sequence and climatic vegetation

 The CBD defines "ecosystem" as: "a dynamic complex of plant, animal, and microbe communities and their inanimate environment that function as a functional unit
" " Along with the need to conserve ecosystems, there was a political need to describe them and identify them efficiently
 Vryugdenhil and Sab say that using a physiognomic-ecological classification system can be achieved most effectively because Ecosystems are easily identifiable on satellite images along the region
 unhone kaha ki sambandhit vanaspati ke sanrachana or mausam-tatv, paristhitik data se purit prayek aaparivartak nirdharak hai jo aanshik rup se alag set prajatiyon ko alag karte hai
 This is true not only for plant species, but also for animal species, fungi and bacteria
 paritantr ke pahchaan kii maatra fisiognomik aaparivartak ke adheen he jise ek chhavi or / yaa kshetra main pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 Special fauna elements may be added where necessary, such as seasonal concentrations of animals and distribution of coral reefs
 kai fisiognomik-paristhitik vargeekaran pranaliyaan uplabdh hai: Several aquatic classification systems are available, an effort being made by the United States Geological Survey and the inter-american Biodiversity Information Network to design an entire ecosystem classification system that will cover both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems
 vigyaan ke pariprekshya se, paaritantr asatat ikayan nahin hai jo keval ek "sahi" vargeekaran drushtikon kaa adhikaar par pahchaane ja sakaten hai
 An attempt by Tensley to describe or classify the ecosystem in agreement with this definition must be clear about the observer / analyst investment in classification, including normative reasoning
 "moulik jivan-aadhaar sevaayen jinpar maanav sabhyataa nirbhar karata he," or yah pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh ho unhen paristhitiki tantra sevaayen kehete hai

 This reduces the impact that the structure of the ecosystem is fundamentally changed to a different state before

 kuch maamalon main, yah ek paristhitik vifaltaa yaa "soupanik poshan shrinkhalaa" ke taraf le ja saktaa he or paristhitik tantra ke bheetar kai prajatiyon kii maut ho saktaa he
 Under this deterministic approach, the abstract idea of ecological health attempts to measure the robustness and recovery potential of an ecosystem, namely how far the ecosystem is away from its steady state
 aksar, haalanki, paristhitiki pranaaliyon kii kshamta ek vighatnkaaree agent se ulat aana padataa he
 The difference between collapse or a benign rebound is determined by two factors - the toxicity of the starting element and the resilience of the original ecosystem
 paaritantron mukhyatah stochastic, in ghatnaon gaiyr par pratikriyaaon bhadakaane-saamagree rahete hai or sharton unhen aasapaas ke avyavon dwaara pratikriyaaon ghatnaon sanchalit kar rahe hai
 Thus, an ecosystem results from the sum of the organism's individual responses to stimuli from the elements in this environment
 upasthiti yaa aabaadi kaa abhaav keval prajnan or prasar safalataa par nirbhar karata he or jansankhya ke str stochastic ghatnaon kii pratikriya main utaar chadhaav ho

 Since the beginning of life organisms have survived persistent changes in behavior through natural selection of successful feeding, breeding and propagation
 is grah kii prajatiyaan prakritik chayan ke madhyam se lagaataar parivartan dwaara apni jaivik sanrachana or vitaran main badalane ke liye anukulit he
 Mathematically, a greater number of different interaction factors can be demonstrated by each individual wanting to inhibit fluctuations in factors
 jabaki anya sthaneey, up aabaadi lagaataar jate hai, baad main anya up ke prasar ke madhyam se pratisthapit kiya ja karne ke liye jansankhya vilupt andar kadam hoga kyonki kuch prajatiyaan gaayab ho jayega prithvi par jeev ke bich mahaan vividhta ko dekhte hue sabase paaritantron keval bahut dhire dhire, badal gaya
 Stochastists identify some internal regulation mechanisms that occur in nature
 is prajati ke str par aapke suzav or pratikriya tantra, sabase vishesh rup se kshetreey vyavhaar ke madhyam se janata ke str ko viniyamit
 Andrewatha or santi kii he ki kshetreey vyavhaar ke str par, jahaan khaadya aapurti ek simit kaarak nahin he aabaadiyon rakhane ke liye jaataa he kaa suzav dete hai
 Therefore, stochastists view regional behavior at the ecosystem level as a regulatory mechanism rather than at the species level
 Thus, in their view, ecosystems are not regulated by the system itself and feedback mechanism and there is no such thing as a balance of nature
 yadi paaritantron vastav mukhyatah stochastic prakriyaaon se sanchalit kar rahe hai, ve or adhik prayek prajatiyon kii tulana main achaanak parivartan karne ke liye vyaktigat rup lacheela ho saktaa he
 In the absence of an equilibrium of nature, ecosystems have species composition, but the entire ecological collapse that will undergo change will depend on the nature of the changes that will probably be rare events

 Drawing on this method and earlier observations of complex ecosystems, Ulanovich's ecosystems are used to determine stress levels and predict system responses to define the type of change in their settings (eg increased or reduced energy flow and eutrophication approaches

 The ecosystem monitors the physical and biological structure and analyzes the impact of these ecosystem characteristics

 paristhithi-vigyaan tantra saamaanya siddhant tantra ko paristhitiki par prayukti ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 This central idea of the ecological system approach is that the ecosystem is a complex system in which emergent properties are displayed

 Ecological systems actively consider external influences such as economics that fall outside the scope of ecosystem ecology

 Rather, they wanted to ban revolutionary actions

 But neither was ever caught nor did he step back from doing revolutionary works
 is baat kaa saboot yah he ki itane aaropon se ghire hone ke baad bhi bhagwati charan ne special train main baithe vysarai ko chalati train main hi uda dene kaa bharpoor prayaas kiya
