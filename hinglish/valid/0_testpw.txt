 Maharishi Dayanand was not only a social reformer and a pioneer of religious renaissance, he was also a great nationalist and political idealist
 videshiyon ke aryaavart main rajya hone ke kaaran aapas kii foot, matbhed, brahmacharya kaa seven na karnaa, vidhaan padhnaa-padhaana va baalyavastha main aswayamvaravivaah, vishayasakti, mithyaa bhashaavadi, kulakshan, veda-vidya kaa prachaar aadi kukarm hai, jab aapas main bhai-bhai ladte hai or tabhi teesraa videshi aakar panch ban baithta he

 Swami Dayanand Saraswati is generally known only as the founder and social reformer of the Arya Samaj
 rashtriya swatantrata ke liye kiye gaye prayatnon main unki ullekhneey bhoomika kii jaankaree bahut kam logon ko he
 The fact is that Swami Dayanand Saraswati had probably first dared to say that "aryavarta belongs to Aryavartis" in the subordinated Aryavarta
 hamaare pratham swatantrata samar, san 1857 kii kranti kii sampoorn yojana bhi swami ji ke netritv main hi taiyaar kii gai thi or vahi uske pramukh sutaradhar bhi the
 He often preached nationalism to the audience in his sermons and filled the spirit of dying for the country
 1855 main haridwar main jab kumbh mela laga tha to usamen shaamil hone ke liye swami ji ne abu parvat se haridwar tak paidal yatra kii thi
 On the way, he preached from place to place and explored the pulse of the countrymen
 unhone yah anubhav kiya ki log ab angrejon ke atyaachaari shashan se tang aa chuke hai or desh kii swatantrata ke liye sangharsh karne ko aatur ho uthe hai
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati reached Haridwar and camped in a solitary place on a hill there
 vahiin par unhone paanch aise vyaktiyon se mulaakaat kii, jo aage chalakar san 1857 kii kranti ke karnadhaar bane
 These five persons were Nana Saheb, Azimullah Khan, Bala Saheb, Tatya Tope and Babu Kunwar Singh
 baatcheet kaaphi lambi chali or yaheen par yah tay kiya gaya ki firangi sarkaar ke viruddh sampoorn desh main sashastr kranti ke liye aadharbhumi taiyaar kii jaae or uske baad ek nishchit din sampoorn desh main ek saath kranti kaa bigul baja diya jaae
 a plan of 'roti Aur Kamal' was also prepared to spread the voice of this revolution among the general public and Aryavartiya soldiers
 is sampoorn vichaar vimarsh main pramukh bhoomika swami dayanand saraswati kii hi thi
 After discussion and planning, Swamiji stopped in Haridwar and the other five national leaders went to their respective places to give realization to the plan
 unke jane ke baad swami ji ne apane kuch vishwast sadhu sanyasiyon se sampark sthapit kiya or unka ek gupt sanghathan banaaya
 The headquarters of this organization was built at the Yogmaya temple at Mehrauli in Indraprastha
 is mukhyalay ne swadhinata samar main ullekhneey bhoomika nibhaai
 Under the leadership of Swamiji, sadhus also awakened the revolution throughout the country
 ve krantikariyon ke sandesh ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par pahunchaate, unhen protsaahit karte or aavashyaktaa padane par swayan bhi hathiyaar uthaakar angrejon se sangharsh karte
 During the entire period of the revolution of 1857, the national leader, Swami Dayanand Saraswati remained in constant contact
 swatantrata-sangharsh kii asafalataa par bhi swami ji niraash nahin the
 He was already aware of the fact that freedom cannot be attained only by trying once
 iske liye to sangharsh kii lambi prakriya chalaani hogi
 At the 1855 meeting in Haridwar itself, when Babu Kunwar Singh asked Swamiji about the possibility of success in this struggle, his answer was "the freedom struggle never fails
" bharat dhire-dhire ek sau varsh main paratantra bana he
 Now it will take one hundred years to become independent as well
 is swatantrata prapti main bahut se anmol praanon kii aahutiyaan daali jaaengi
 "how accurate Swami Ji's prediction turned out to be, was confirmed by subsequent events
 swatantrata-sangharsh kii asafalataa ke baad jab tathya tope, naanaa sahab tathaa anya rashtriya netaa swami ji se mili to unhen bhi unhone niraash na hone tathaa uchit samay kii pratiksha karne kii hi salaah di
 Two years after the revolution of 1857, Swamiji made Swami Virjanand his guru and took initiation from him
 swami virajanand ke ashram main rahakar unhone vedon kaa adhyayan kiya, un par chintan kiya or uske baad apane guru ke nirdeshaanusaar ve vaidic gyaan ke prachaar-prasar main jute gaye
 To achieve this objective, he also founded the Arya Samaj and through it did many works of social improvement
 chuaachhut, sati pratha, bal vivaah, nar bali, dharmik sankeernata tathaa andhvishwaason ke viruddh unhone jamkar prachaar kiya or vidhwaa vivaah, dharmik udaartaa tathaa aapasi bhaichaare kaa unhone samarthan kiya
 Along with all this, Swamiji never failed to fill the spirit of patriotism among the people
 prarambh main anek vyaktiyon ne swami ji ke samaaj sudhaar ke kaaryon main vibhinn prakaar ke vighn daale or unka virodh kiya
 Gradually, his arguments began to be understood by the people and the protest was reduced
 unki lokapriyata nirantar badhane lagi
 This led to a desire in the minds of British officials that if they were made in favor of the British Government, then through them, the British could be popularized in the general public
 isse purv angrej adhikari isi prakaar se anya kuch dharmopadeshkon tathaa dharmadhikariyon ko vibhinn prakaar ke pralobhan dekar apni taraf mila chuke the
 He also considered Swami Dayanand Saraswati like him
 tadnusaar ek isai padri ke madhyam se swami ji kii tatkaaleen governor general lord northbrook se mulaakaat karavaayi gai
 The meeting took place in Calcutta in March 1873
 idhar-udhar kii kuch aupchaarik baton ke uparant lord northbrook ne vinamrata se apni baat swami ji ke saamne rakhi- "apane vyaakhyaan ke prarambh main aap jo ishwar kii prarthana karte hai, kya usamen aap angreji sarkaar ke kalyaan kii bhi prarthana kar sakenge
 " garvanar general kii baat sunakar swami ji sahaj hi sab kuch samaj gaye
 He also felt pity for the intelligence of the British government, which could not understand him properly
 unhone nirbhikta or dridhtaa se governor general ko uttar diya- The Governor General did not expect such a sharp reply from Swamiji
 mulaakaat tatkaal samaapt kar di gai or swami ji vahaan se laut aae
 After this, the intelligence department of the government had a keen eye on Swami ji and his organization Arya Samaj
 unki prayek gatividhi or unke dwaara bole gaye prayek shabd kaa ricard rakhaa jane laga
 Due to their impact on the general public, the government began to realize that this rebel Fakir and Arya Samaj can become a threat to the government any day
 isliye swami ji ko samaapt karne ke liye bhi tarah-tarah ke shadyantr rache jane lage
 The circumstances under which Swamiji died, give the same impression that there was definitely a conspiracy of the English government in it
 swami ji kii mrityu 30 oktober 1883 ko deepawali ke din sandhyaa ke samay hui thi
 In those days, he had gone to Jodhpur at the invitation of King Naresh Jaswant Singh
 vahaan unke nity hi pravachan hote the
 Sometimes Maharaja Jaswant Singh would also sit at his feet and listen to his sermons there
 do-chaar baar swami ji bhi rajya mehalon main gaye
 There he saw the unnecessary intervention of a prostitute named Nanhi and his immense influence on Maharaj Jaswant Singh
 swami ji ko yah bahut bura laga
 When he explained this to Maharaj, he politely accepted his word and broke the relationship with the little one
 isse nanheen swami ji ke bahut adhik viruddh ho gai
 He got Swami ji's cook Kalia alias Jagannath on his side and got the glass mixed in his milk
 thodi hi der baad swami ji ke paas aakar apana aparaadh sweekaar kar liya or uske liye kshamaa maangi
 The benevolent-hearted Swami Ji gave him five hundred rupees for his living and living, so that the police would not disturb him
 baad main jab swami ji ko jodhpur ke aspataal main bhartee karavaaya gaya to vahaan sambandhit chikitsak bhi shaq ke daayre main rahaa
 He was accused of giving light poison to Swamiji in the name of medicine
 baad main jab swami ji kii tabiyat bahut kharaab hone lagi to unhen ajmer ke aspataal main laayaa gaya
 But by then there was a lot of delay
 swami ji ko bachaaya nahin ja sakaa
 The apprehension in this entire incident is that the task of raising the prostitute and tricking the doctor was done by a British officer at the behest of the British government
 anyathaa ek saadhaaran veshya ke liye yah sambhav nahin tha ki keval apane balboote par swami dayanand saraswati jaise suprasiddh or lokapriy vyakti ke viruddh aisa shadyantr kar sake
 Without such encouragement and protection, even the doctor could not do this audacity
 swadharm, swabhaasha, swarashtra, swasamskruti or swadeshonnati ke agradoot swami dayanand ji kaa sharir san 1883 main deepawali ke din panchtatv main villin ho gaya or ve apane peeche chhod gaye ek siddhanth, krinvanto vishwamaryam - arthath saare sansar ko shreshth maanav banaao

 The early books were in Sanskrit, but over time he also wrote many books in Aryabhasa, because Aryabhasa had more reach than Sanskrit
 hindi ko unhone 'aryabhasha' kaa naam diya tha
 Swami Dayanand was the pioneer and early man who used the Aryabhasha for better writing
 swami dayanand saraswati kii mukhya kritiyaan nimnlikhit hai- In 1873, a book called Aryodeshyaratnamala was published in which Swamiji described the definition of one hundred words
 inamen se kai shabd aam bolchaal main aate hai par unke arth rutes ho gaye hai, udhaaharan ke liye, ishwar, dharm, karm, aadi
 They are defined and explained in this book
 is laghu pustika main 8 prishth hai
 In 1881, Swami Dayanand published a book called Gokrunanidhi which also takes credit for playing a major role in establishing the Goraksha movement
 is pustak main unhone sabhi samudaay ke logon ko apane pratinidhi sahit gokrishyaadi raksha samiti kii sadsyta lene ko kaha he jiskaa uddeshy pashu va krishi kii raksha he
 Like modern environmentalists, ideas have been made here
 is pustak main samiksha, niyam va upanium hai, tathaa pramukhtah pashuon ko na maar kar unka paalan karne main hone vaale laabh varnit kiye gaye hai
 The book Behavnabhanu was published in 1880 by the Vedic machinery, Banaras
 isamen dharmokt or uchit vyavhaar ke bare main varnan he
 On 27 February 1883, Swami Dayanand Saraswati in Udaipur published an acknowledgment in which he handed over the responsibility of philanthropy to 23 persons after his death, who could then carry on their work
 inamen mahadev govind rande kaa bhi naam he
 This acknowledgment is signed as a witness to 13 dignitaries
 iske prakaashan ke kuch chah maah pashchaat hi unka dehant ho gaya tha
 This is a small conversation book teaching Sanskrit

 "'premchand', who gave the best form of Hindi story, defines the story as follows:" The story is that of Dhrupad, in which the singer shows his perfect talent as soon as the Mahaphil starts, in a moment full of chivalry
 It does not happen as much as listening to the song overnight
 " hindi ke lekhakon main premchand pehle vyakti hai jinhone apane teen lekhon main kahani ke sambandh main apane vichaar vyakt kiye hai – ‘kahani ek rachana he jisamen jivan ke kisi ek ang yaa kisi ek manobhaav ko pradarshit karnaa hi lekhak kaa uddeshy rahata he
 His character, his style, his narrative, all reinforce the same sentiment

 Karl Benz proposed to maintain cooperation between DMG and Benz & Cie
 When Germany's economic conditions began to deteriorate after World War I, dmg's speculators refused to accept it initially
 Negotiations between the two companies Several years later, when these conditions became worse, and in 1924, they made a document of mutual cooperation, which was valid till the year 2000

 In 1877, George Selden of Rochester, New York designed the first design of an American automobile with a gasoline internal combustion engine, who requested for his patent in 1879, but the request was rejected because the vehicle was never built
 Neither ever came in handy
 After years of delays and adding several series to his application, Solah sang the American patent to Seldon in November 5, 1895, for his two-stroke automobile engine, which proved to be more obstructive than encouraging vehicles in America

 As a result of this rapid change, where small pieces remained with each other, production took place in large quantities, each part at a lower cost
 For example, in the 1930s, La Salle, which sold Cadillac
 Used cheap mechanical parts made by Olds Mobile; similarly Chervole shared his hood, doors, roof and windows with Pontiacs; And by 1990, corporate drive trains and shared platforms, suspense and other parts) had become a common practice

 Diesel engine cars were long known in Europe, with the first models introduced in the 1930s by Mercedes Benz and Citroën
 The main advantages of diesel engines were that they had a 50% higher burn efficiency when compared to the best gasoline engines
 , Which had 27%

 The carburetor was used in almost all road-going car engines until the 1980s, when it was used to obtain better control over the mixture of fuel and air, which was found by fuel injection
 Indirect fuel injection was first in aircraft engines
 Used in 1909, it was used in racing car engines in the 1930 Satak and was used in road cars since the 1950s

 After a small change, gasoline-powered vehicles can run at 85% ethanol concentrations
 00% ethanol is used in some parts of the world, but vehicles must be started on pure gasoline and then switched to ethanol
 When the engine is running
 Most of the gasoline powered engines are also run by LPG, where an LPG tank is used for fuel storage and LPG mixer is used for carbureation

 For some time, electrics were considered superior due to their silent nature when they were compared to the noisy gasoline engine
 This advantage was removed in 1897 by Muffler, the inventor of Hiram Percy Maxim
 Thereafter internal combustion The power cars had two significant advantages: 1) long range and 2) four specific energy
 The battery electric vehicle was built to rival the internal combustion model and they were Had to Tsar until modern semiconductor controls and improved starting batteries
 Because they could deliver a higher torque at lower resolutions, electric cars did not require such a complex drive train nor transmissions that internal combustion cars needed

 Esteem power, mostly used for oil - or gas - used boilers, was used until the 1930s, but its major disadvantage was that it could not provide electricity to the tax until boiler pressure was available
 This is that it gives very low emissions and because of this the combustion process can be controlled very carefully
 Its disadvantages include weak heat efficiency and expansion needs

 Systematic research on accident safety started at Ford Motor Company in 1958
 Since then, most of the research is focused on absorbing external crash energy
 With crushable panels and in reducing the speed of the human body in the passenger compartment
 This is reflected in most cars that are made right now

 yadi sthaan puri tarah ghira hua nahin he, balki uskaa mukh samudr se aane jane ke liye sadaa khulaa rahata he, to uske liye 'basin' naam adhik upyukt he, yadhyapi yah naam sarvyaapee nahin he
 There are gates or chambers installed on the mouth of the docks, so that water can be kept in them to the desired level
 jis godi main pani praaia: ek hi tal tak rahata he, vah sajal godi kehalaati he tathaa jis godi main se pani bilkul khaali kiya ja saktaa he, vah 'sukhi godi' kehalaati he
 Ships are brought to the dry dock for inspection or repair
 sukhi godi kaa hi ek rup 'tirti godi' he
 It is a structure of large floating pus, which can be lowered or elevated by filling, or emptying, and the vessel can be placed over it and lifted over the water
 jin pattanon main prakrutipradutt surakshit or gaharaa vishaal basin hota he, jowarbhata kam aata he or samudr main tej dharaayen nahin hotin, vahaan sajal godi kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti, jaise neuyork main
 But dry or sloping dock is an essential part of all major modern ports
 samudratat yaa naditat par prakritik yaa gahari khodi hui upakhaadi hoti he, jiske kinare jahaajon main maal ladane yaa utaarne ke liye pakke ghat yaa platfarm bane hote hai
 If they are parallel to the coast, it is called Parshghat or Push
 or yadi jal main pravesh karte hue tat ke lambavatathwa anya kisi kone par bane hote hai, to paae kehalaate hai
 Ghats, Dhaks or Paia Sajal are the main parts of the dock
 kabhi kabhi tirte ghat bhi banaae jate hai, jo jowar bhaate ke saath unche neeche ho sakate hai
 They are connected to the fixed ghats by mobile bridges
 godi kii deevaaren bahut majboot banaai jaati hai
 These are usually of corrugated concrete, monolithic concrete, compressed air-fired chambers, reinforced concrete with porous drum, or composite walls of slabs, drums, etc
 inke upar praaia: granite kii sheershika avashya rahati he
 Nowadays, ships are often boxed
 unki deevaaren sidhi khadi rahati hai yaa kabhi kabhi upar kii ore bheetar ko jhuki rahati hai
 Therefore the walls of the ghat are built either vertically or almost vertically at the front, so that ships can come very close to the ghat and be within reach of the loading cranes
 deevaaren pushton kii bhanti banaai jaati hai, jinaki peeche kii sataha dhaalu yaa seedhidaar rahati he
 Their foundation is very wide, so that the soil below does not overload its capacity
 neenv peeche kii ore kuch dhaalu bhi rakhi jaati he, taaki bharaai kaa dabaav padane par diwaar kii ore khisak na jaae
 The walls are designed by taking care of the fixed weight of the wall and the filling of the back
 inaki ausat motaai, oonchaai kii chauthai se kam nahin hoti, praaia: ek tihaai rakhi jaati he
 The width at the base varies from half to two-thirds of the height
 diwaar main lagbhag 50-50 foot par jalchhidr rakhe jate hai, taaki jab saamne pani kaa tal nicha ho tab peeche kaa pani nikal sake
 Where the tide ebbs are very high, large basins are often enclosed and closed and large gates are installed to keep the water on the same floor
 jowar ke baad jab bhaata aarambh hota he, tab ye phatak band kar die jate hai, jisase godi main pani unchaa rah jaataa he
 These types of gandis are called 'closed laps'
 praveshdvara ke phatak main do palle hote hai, jo band hone par ek uthi hui dehal ke upar paraspar mil jate hai
 The gate is very long
 isaki deevaaron main chaude chaude khaanche hote hai, jisamen palle khulkar ghus jate hai
 When the gate is closed, the walls also act as a pavement to prevent the water flow falling on it
 ye phatak keval thode samay ke liye hi, arthath jab jowar aata he tabhi, khole ja sakate hai
 So there can be limited traffic
 icchaanusaar avaagaman sambhav ke liye dwaara bahut lanbaa banaaya Goes and gates are placed at both its ends
 isse bich main ek jalpash ban jaataa he - usee prakaar kaa jaisaa naharon main jhiilon ke nikat yatayaat ke liye hota he
 Water pots are expensive and surround the place rather than the gate, but can be useful day and night
 isliye aadhunik bade pattanon main praaia: ye hi banaae jate hai
 If there are single gates in them, then only in the form of subsidiary doors
 jalpash kaa pani unchaa yaa nicha karne ke liye bagali deevaaron main bade bade jalakapaat yaa puliyaan hoti hai
 Modern large water vessels often have a gate in the middle, so that two parts of the water vessel can be made and small vessels can be placed in them
 jahaan praveshdvara par bahut hi unchaa jowar aata he yaa bheeshan lehren uthati hai, vahaan phatakon kii raksha ke liye unase vipareet disha main khulanevaala ek phatak baahar kii ore laga diya jaataa he
 This is called the storm gate
 godi ke phatak lakdi yaa ispaat ke hote hai
 Greenwoods, Jarrahs, or other heavy and hardwoods are planted in them
 lohe par khaare pani kaa bura prabhaav padataa he or yadi usamen malajal mila ho, to or bhi adhik
 Therefore steel gates last only about 30 years, while wood gates last about 50 years
 lakdi ke phatakon kaa bhaar bhi kam hota he
 The Liverpool dock gate is 90 feet wide and feet high
 iskaa harihrit kaa ek pallaa vajan main keval 165 ton he, jabaki landan ke 80 foot chaude, foot unche phatak kaa ispaat kaa ek pallaa 185 ton kaa he
 The cost of wooden gates is about 50 percent more than that of steel gates: ye phatakon se achche samajhe jate hai, kyonki inako sthaan dene ke liye deevaaron main bade bade khaanche rakhane kii aavashyaktaa nahin rahati
 In the cells, there is a contact surface of the green wall on the side and bottom, which is fitted with rubber so that it fits in the door and stops the water
 aavashyaktaanusaar inkaa bhaar kam zyada karne ke liye inke bheetar pani kii tankiyan bani rahati hai or unhen yaa khaali karne ke liye pump, valve aadi lage rahete hai
 There are two types of doorways: ye chaukor bhi ho sakati hai, kintu adhiktar jahaajon kii akruti jaisi hoti hai
 They do not have any specified driving system, but are swam and taken to the place
 kshubgh mausam main, yaa teevr dhara main, inhen sanbhaalanaa aasaan nahin hota
 They are square and are of two types according to the specified conduction system - wooden clutches are placed in the sliding chambers, forcing them to move to the place on the way over the masonry
 duusare prakaar kii pahievaali kothiyaan hoti hai, jo dehal par lagi patariyon par chalati hai
 Sometimes the wheels are on the floor and the tracks are in the closets
 pargami kothiyaan jab dwaar kholane ke liye khiskaai jaati hai, tab ve diwaar ke bheetar bani lambii lambii jhirriyon main ghus jaati hai
 In dry docks, there is an arrangement to bring one or more ships inside, close the gates and drain the water by pumps
 isaki deevaaron or pende par jalaabhedya padaarth, jaise kancreet-sahit itan kii chinai yaa granite mukhai, kaa astr kiya rahata he
 Where high tides come in the ebb, sometimes they take advantage of them and bring the ship in during the tide and close the gates after the ebb
 is prakaar pump dwaara pani nikaalane kii aavashyaktaa nahin rahati
 Dry basins are considered essential for construction, inspection and repair etc
 of ships and scope for future expansion at the time of their design
 sukhi godi kii upyogita is drushti se aanki jaati he ki usamen lambey se lanbaa kitna bada jahaaj aa saktaa he
 The Bombay dock, which became operational in 1914, is 1,000 feet long, 100 feet wide and 34 feet 9 inches deep
 yah us samay sansar kii godiyon main duusare number par thi
 Already in 1913, Gladston Dock, Liverpool's 1,050 feet 4 inches long, 12 feet wide and 43 feet 11 inches deep, was built
 ab capatoun kii 1,212 foot 6 inch lambii, 148 foot chaudee or 45 foot gahari sukhi godi, jo san 1945 main chaalu hui he, sansar main sabase badi he
 The capacity of lifting the loading dock ranges from 300 tonnes to 100,000 tonnes
 dwitiya vishwamahayuddh ke pehle campbell dizine bahut prachlit thi, jiske anusaar sadampton main vishaltam atlantic lineron or yupoton ko sthaan dene ke liye 60,000 ton kii tirti godi bani
 Later, there was a need for even bigger docks
 portsmath kii 54,000 ton kii 'admirelti tirti godi 859 foot 6 inch lambii or bheetar bheetar 129 foot 6 inch chaudee he
 It can lift a ship sinking 38 feet in water
 dwitiya vishwayuddh main bamanvarsha dwaara nasht hui singapore kii godi kaa sthaan lene ke liye 50,000 ton kii 857 foot 8 inch lambii, 126 foot 6 inch chaudee or kul 40 foot gahari godi bombai main 1947 i
 main taiyaar kii gai, jo baad main malta pahunchaai gai
 Sliding laps can be easily and rapidly designed, moved and molded to fit the situation
 isliye ye jahaajon kii aaptkaaleen marammat ke liye sukhi godiyon kii apeksha adhik moolyavaan hoti hai
 But due to iron or steel, they do not last more than 30-40 years
 inke liye surakshit sthaan bhi chahie or adhik gaharaai bhi
 Where a dry dock of 520 feet long, 60 feet wide and 30 feet deep will suffice for a sinking ship 500 feet long, 55 feet wide and 28 feet, the sloping dock shall take another 20 feet deep to go under the ship; And if the tide is 15-20 feet high, then about 70 feet deep water is required for the sloping dock
 yadi kudarti gaharaai itani nahin he, to talkarshan dwaara itani kerani padegi
 Under normal circumstances, it is not only difficult, but often impossible
 haan, tirti godi kii lambaai chaudaai jahaj kii lambaai chaudaai se adhik honi anivaary nahin he, keval uski utthapan kshamta jahaaj ke vajan se adhik honi chahie
 There are many types of tirti lapis
 kuch main donon or deevaaren hoti hai, kuch main keval ek or
 Boxed, cobbled-block and cask-shaped docks are very popular in both and walled docks
 kaabalyojya khandonwali aadhunik godi main baks jaisi godi ke sabhi gun hai
 It is best in large docks
 isamen lagbhag ek si lambaai ke teen khand hote hai, jo sab ek sidh main jode ja sakate hai, rakhe jate hai or unpar donon ore do deevaaren kablon dwaara kas di jaati hai
 Some of these casks can be removed and placed above the remaining casks in the length direction between the walls
 hawana kii spani sarkaar ke liye sarvapratham banaai gai, hawana prakaar kii godi main do khadi deevaaren hoti hai, jinke bich main peepe rakhkar kablon se jod die jate hai
 Any of these cask can be removed and placed on top of the remainder
 yah tip ab pracheen ho gai he
 On one side there are two famous varieties of walled dock
 apatat godi 1884 i
 main patent hui thi
 Its walls are connected by cords occupied along the coast
 godi do khandon main hoti he or ek khand duusare ke upar rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Being a single side wall, ships can be mounted on three sides
 duusari kism kii godi nikshep godi kehalaati he, jo san 1877 main patent hui thi
 In this, the wall is long, but there is a middle space between the casks below, that is, the casks are placed in the wall in such a way that the fingers are in the hand
 in pipon par rakhaa hua jahaaj tat par bane hue sthunon ke jungle ke upar rakhaa ja saktaa he or godi khaali kii ja sakati he
 It also occurs in two sections, which can be placed on top of each other
 sthirataa ke liye ye khand kabjon se lage samaantar dandon ke dwaara ek tirti uladi, yaa rokliver, se jude rahete hai
 These are extremely important for shipping
 aadhunik pattanon main inaki paryaapt vyavastha avashya honi chahie
 Their purpose is that ships can come easily from the sea, they get adequate and safe ferries, there is a facility to take off the cargo fast, to take the cargo to and from the ghats and to keep it in the warehouse if need be, Proper arrangement in suvidhaon main sudhaar kar dene se praaia: godiyon ke vistaar main honevaala bahut sa kharch bachaaya ja saktaa he
 The methods of handling cargo vary from port to port
 kahin par maal ghat par utarkar sidhe railgadiyon main, yaa anya gadiyon main, lad diya jaataa he
 Elsewhere goods are taken from larger ships to smaller ships
 kahin kahin ye donon tareeke apanaae jate hai
 Generally, one dock crane of three tons each is fitted at each exit site for general cargo
 adhikansh gattharon kaa ausat vajan praaia: 30 handerwet hota he
 It is better to use a 10 to 20 ton capacity slanting crane to carry heavy load
 lagbhag 2,000 ton saamaanya naubhaar prati din uthaane kii vyavastha acchhee samajhi jaati he
 The administration of ports is also varied
 france or italy main pattan rajyaniyantrit hote hai
 The ports of London, Liverpool, Glasgow and New York have autonomous governance
 great britain ke bahuterey pattan pehle railway ke niyantran main the
 Municipalities or generals have control over ports in Bristol, Antwerp, Philadelphia and Baltimore
 anek apradhan pattanon main nijee niyantran hi he
 Whatever the control officer is, the work is the same, ie construction and repair of dock structures and machines, digging and cleaning of access road, removal of fractal, arranging lighting, licensing porters and small ships, on dock staff Maintaining control, fixing of freight charges etc
 and making recovery and keeping police etc
 saamaanya prashasan ke liye bahudhaa ek board bana diya jaataa he, jo alag-alag kaamon ke liye alag-alag samitiyaan niyukt kar detaa he
 All operations of the port are under a dock manager
 iske paas paryaapt karmchaaree hote hai, jinamein ek mukhya ejeeniyar, ek shahbandar, yatayaat prabandhak or inke adhinsth vibhaagon ke karmchaaree hote hai
 Revenue for port operations is collected from the ships receiving patronage and accommodation in the form of revenue and charges etc
 ye prabhaar anek prakaar ke ho sakate hai, kintu ye sab praaia: poton ke panjikrut tanmaan ke aadhaar par hi nirdhaarit kiye jate hai

 In the mid-19th century, Charles Darwin gave the scientific theory of evolution through natural selection
 unhone ise apni kitaab jeevajati kaa udbhav main prakashit kiya
 The process of evolution by natural selection can be proved by the following observations: 1) more offspring are born than they can possibly survive, 2) the population has a variety of morphological, physical, and behavioral traits, 3) Different traits provide different chances of post-life and reproduction, and 4) traits are given from one generation to the next
 is prakaar, peedi dar peedi aabaadi un shakson kii santanon dwaara pratisthapit ho jaati he jo us baiophisical parivesh ke behatar anukulit hon

 In contrast to these physical ideas, Aristotelianism regarded all natural things as the real forms of fixed natural possibilities, known as forms

 Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the Middle Ages and integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real-type creatures always conform to each other for true spiritual forms, and especially new types

 In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertus wrote about the natural modifications that occur during breeding and accumulated over many generations to produce new species
 georges-louis leclerrk, comate di bamphone ne suzav diya ki prajatiyaan alag-alag jeevon main bighad sakati hai, or irasmus darwin ne prastaav kiya tha ki sabhi garm rakt vaale jaanavar ek hi sookshmjeev se utar sakate the
 The first fully developed development plan was jean-baptiste Lemarck's "transformation" theory of 1809, in which healthy generations consistently created simpler forms of life that developed more complexity with a progressive tendency inherent in parallel lineages, and localized At the level, these lineages can be adapted to the environment due to changes in their use or absence in the parents

 In particular, George Cuvre asserted that species are unrelated and determined, their similarities reflect divine design for functional needs
 Meanwhile, William Paly developed Red's ideas into natural theology or the god of existence and existence of Christians

 Partially influenced by an essay on the theory of population by Thomas Robert Malthus, Darwin stated that population growth can lead to a "struggle for survival" in which favorable variation prevails as others die

 It can explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common lineage through the work of natural laws in the same way for all types of organisms

 Thomas Henry Huxley applied Darwin's ideas to humans, using paleontology and comparative anatomy to provide convincing evidence that humans and apes shared a common ancestry

 The mechanisms of reproductive heredity and the origin of new traits remained a mystery
 is disha main, darwin ne pengenesis ke apana asthaayee siddhant viksit kiya
 In 1865, Gregor Mendel reported that the elements were inherited in a predictable manner through independent classification and separation elements
 mandaal ke viraasat ke kanoonon ne antat darwin ke sabase adhik pengensis siddhant kii purti kii
 August Weismann has significant differences between germ cells that give rise to gametes and somatic cells of the body, showing that heredity only passes through the germ line

 De Wills was also one of the researchers who made Mendel's work well known, assuming that Mendelian traits correspond to the transfer of genetic changes at the germline

 In 1973, the evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobhansky wrote that "nothing in biology leaves the light of evolution", because it brought to light the earlier relationship to the contradictory facts of those natural relations, a knowledge of which Explains in clear explanatory body and many observational facts about life on this planet have been speculated

 Diversity comes from mutations in the genome, altering genes through sexual reproduction and migration among populations
 utparivartan or jin pravaah ke madhyam se nai vividhtaon ke nirantar parichay ke baavjood, prajatiyon ke adhikansh jinom us prajati ke sabhi vyaktiyon main samaan hai
 However, relatively small differences in genotype can also lead to dramatic differences in phenotype: for example, chimpanzees and humans differentiate in about 5% of their genomes
 mukhya lekh: utparivartan Repeat mutation of part of a chromosome is a change in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome
 jab utparivartan hote hai, ve ek jin ke utpaada ko badal sakate hai, yaa jin ko kaary karne se roak sakate hai, yaa iskaa koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 Based on studies in the fly Drosophila melanogaster, it has been suggested that if a gene changes the protein produced by the gene, it will likely be harmful, with approximately 70% of these mutations having a harmful effect, and the remaining neutral or weak forms
 Beneficial from
 utparivartan ek gunasutra ke bade virgon ko doharaaya ja rahaa shaamil kar sakate hai, jo ek jin kii atirikt pratiyaan jinom main pesh kar sakate hai
 Additional copies of genes are a major source of raw materials needed for new genes to be developed
 yah mahatvapurn he kyonki adhikansh jin purv-maujuuda jin se jin pariwaron main viksit hote hai, jo saamaanya purvajon ko saajha karte hai
 For example, the human eye uses four genes to create structures that perceive light: three for color vision and one for night vision; All four descend from a single ancestral gene
 jab ek dupliket pratilipi ek nae fnction ko utparivartit or praapt karata he, to ek nae jin ko janajaatiy jin se utpann kiya ja saktaa he
 Once the gene has been replicated, as this system increases redundancy, this process becomes easier; One gene in the pair may acquire a new function while the other copy continues its original function
 anya prakaar ke utparivartan, pehle gaiyr-koding diene se puri tarah se nae jin utpann kar sakate hai
 Generation of new genes can also replicate small portions of multiple genes, with these fragments being recombined to create new combinations with new functions
 jab nae jin ko purv-maujuuda bhaagon main pherbadal karne se ikattha kiya jaataa he, to domen saral swatantra kaaryon ke saath modul ke rup main kaary karata he, jo nae or jatil kaaryon ke saath nae sanyojanon kaa utpaadan karne ke liye milaayaa ja saktaa he
 For example, polyketed syntheses are large enzymes that make antibiotics; They are up to one hundred independent domains that each take one step in an overall process, such as one step in an assembly line adhik jaankaree: yon prajnan, anuvanshik punarsangyojan, or yon prajnan ke vikachalangik jeevon main, jin ko ek saath viraasat main mila he, yaa judaa hua he, kyonki ve prajnan ke dauraan anya jeevon ke jeenon ke saath mishrit nahin ho sakate
 In contrast, offspring of sexual organisms are produced through an independent mixture of chromosomes from their parents
 ek sambandhit prakriya main mutabik punarsangyojan kaha jaataa he, yon jeev do milan gunasutron ke bich diene kaa aadan-pradaan karte hai
 Recombination and recombination do not alter allele frequencies, but rather alleles giving rise to offspring are associated with each other with new combinations of alleles
 sex aamtaur par anuvanshik bhinnata ko badhaata he or vikaas kii dar main vruddhi kar saktaa he
 This diagram shows the dual cost of sex
 yadi prayek vyakti ek hi sankhya main vansh main yogadan karnaa hota he, yon aabaadi prayek peedi ke samaan aakaar bani hui he, jahaan prayek peedi ke aakaar main ajanak prajnan jansankhya doguna ho jaati he
 The twofold cost of sex was previously described by John Maynard Smith
 pehali laagat yah he ki langik rup se minu prajati main keval do lingon main se ek hi yuva ho saktaa he
 
 duusari laagat yah he ki jo bhi vyakti yon punarutpaadan karata he vah keval 50% jeenon se kisi bhi alag-alag santanon ko de saktaa he, saath hi har nae peedi ke paas
 Yet sexual reproduction between eukaryotes and multicellular organisms are more common means of reproduction
 red queen pariklpana kaa upyog ek yon-prajnan ke mahatv ko samajhane ke liye kiya gaya he, jo kabhi-kabhi badalte maahaul main anya prajatiyon ke saath sah-vikaas ke jawaab main lagaataar vikaas or anukulan ko sakasham karne ke saadhan ke rup main upyog karata he
 More information: gene flow is the exchange of genes between populations and species
 isliye yah vividhta kaa ek strot ho saktaa he jo jansankhya yaa kisi prajati ke liye nayaa he jin pravaah jeevon kii alag-alag aabaadi ke bich ke vyaktiyon ke andolan ke kaaran ho saktaa he, kyonki antardeshiy or tateey aabaadi ke bich chuhon ke andolan yaa ghaas ke baari dhaatu sahishnu or baari dhaatu samvedansheel aabaadi ke bich paraag kii gati ke kaaran ho saktaa he
 Gene transfer between species involves the formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer
 kshaitij jin transfar ek jeev se anuvanshik padaarthon ke sthanantaran ko duusare jeev main sthanantarit karata he jo ki iske vansh main nahin he; yah bacteria main sabase aam he
 In medicine, it contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance, such that when a bacterium acquires resistance genes, it can rapidly transfer them to other species
 bacteria se jin ke kshaitij hastantaran jaise ki khamir Saccharomyces cerevisiae or adzuki been weevil Callosobruchus chinensis hua he
 An example of large-scale translocation is eukaryotic badeloid rotifers, which have received many genes from bacteria, fungi, and plants
 virus jeevon ke bich diene bhi le sakate hai, jaivik domen main bhi jeenon ke hastantaran kii anumati de sakate hai
 During the acquisition of chloroplasts and mitochondria, large-scale gene transfer has also occurred between eukaryotic cells and the ancestors of bacteria
 yah sambhav he ki eukeriots swayan bacteria or orchia ke bich kshaitij jin sthaanantaran se utpann hue hai
 Mutation after natural selection results in populations with darker colors
 ek nav-darvinian pariprekshya se, vikaas tab hota he jab antarjaateey jeevon kii aabaadi ke bheetar alleles ke aavritiyon main parivartan hote hai
 For example, alleles become more common for blacks in a population of moths
 Mechanisms that can alter allele frequencies include natural selection, genetic drift, genetic hitchhiking, mutation, and gene flow
 mukhya lekh: prakritik varan Growth is the process through natural selection by which survival and reproduction become more common in successive generations of the population
 ise aksar "aatmanirbhar" tantra kaha jaataa he kyonki yah jaruri he ki teen saral tathyon ke anusaar: Variations exist within the population of organisms in relation to morphology, physiology, and behavior
 vibhinn lakshan jivit rahane or punarutpaadan kii alag-alag daren pradaan karte hai 
 These symptoms can be passed from generation to generation
 adhik santanon kaa jivit rahane kii tulana main utpaadan kiya ja saktaa he, or ye sthitiyaan astitv or prajnan ke liye jeevon ke bich pratispardhaa kaa utpaadan karti hai
 As a result, fossils with properties that give them an advantage over their rivals are likely to pass on their properties to the next generation with properties that do not confer an advantage
 prakritik chayan kii mukhya avadharana ek jeev ke vikaas kii yogyata he
 Health is measured by its ability to survive and reproduce, which determines the size of its genetic contribution to the next generation
 haalanki, fitness santanon kii kul sankhya ke samaan nahin he: iske bajaay fitness ko baad kii pidiyon ke anupaat dwaara ingit kiya jaataa he jo kisi jeev ke jin ko lete hai
 For example, if an organism could survive well and breed quickly, but its descendants were too young and vulnerable to survive, this organism would have little genetic contribution to future generations and thus less There will be fitness
 yadi aleble us jin ke anya eliljon se adhik fitness badhaata he, to prayek peedi ke saath yah elil aabaadi ke bheetar adhik saamaanya ho jayega
 These symptoms are called "selected for"
 lakshanon ke udhaaharan jo fitness main vruddhi kar sakate hai badhaayaa astitv or badhati hui urvartaa iske vipareet, is elil main kam phydemand yaa hanikaarak elil parinaam hone ke kaaran kam fitness kam hota ja rahaa he - inhen "iske khilaaf chunaa gaya he
 "importantly, the fitness of the allele is not a definitive feature; if changes in the environment, first neutral or harmful traits may be beneficial and the first beneficial properties become harmful
 haalanki, bhale hi chayan kii disha is tarah se ulat ho jaati he, ateet main kho gaye lakshan ek samaan rup main phir se viksit nahin ho sakate hai 
 Natural selection within a population for a trait, which can vary on a variety of values such as elevation, can be classified into three different types
 The first is directional selection, which over time is associated with a particular trait
 The average value changes — for example, organisms gradually become higher
 duusare, vighatnkaaree chayan atyadhik gun mulyon ke liye chayan hota he or aksar do alag-alag mulyon main sabase aam ho jaataa he, ausat mulya ke khilaaf chayan ke saath
 This will happen when either miniature or high organisms have an advantage, but not of medium height
 Finally, stabilizing selection involves choosing between extreme characteristics on either side, which is the average value and low diversity
 Reduces the variance around
 yah, udhaaharan ke liye, kaaran jeev dhire-dhire sabhi ek hi oonchaai ban jaaenge
 a special case of natural selection is sexual selection, which is the selection for any trait that enhances the success of sexual intercourse and the attractiveness of creatures of potential friends
 yon chayan ke madhyam se viksit hue lakshan vishesh rup se kai pashu prajatiyon ke purushon ke bich pramukh hai
 Although sensually favored, traits such as cumbersome horns, consistent calls, large body size, and bright colors often attract inspiration, compromising the survival of individual men
 yah astitv kaa nuksaan purushon main ucch prajnan kii safalataa se santulit hota he jo in kathin-se-nakli, yon rup se chaynit lakshan dikhaate hai
 Natural selection most commonly measures the disposition against which individuals and personal qualities are more likely to survive

 Eugene Odum, the founder of the ecosystem, defined an ecosystem as: "any entity that includes all organisms 


 in a field of interaction with a physical environment so that the flow of energy clearly defines trophic structure, Biological diversity and the physical cycle within the system
 " ek paristhitiki tantra ke bheetar prayek jansankhya pranali ke anya bhaagon main alag-alag rishton ke saath ek vishisht jagah yaa sthiti main rahati he

 Natural selection can function at different levels of organization, such as genes, cells, individual organisms, groups of organisms and species
 chayan ek saath kai staron par kaary kar saktaa he
 An example of selection occurring below the level of an individual organism is a gene called transposons, which can replicate and spread across a genome

 In this exhibition, a variety of works done on paper were included
 In these works, he included photographs of himself to present his thoughts on migration after coming to Mumbai in 1998
 The inclusion of a miniature photographic collection of self-portraits is a common feature of Hema's paintings

 In 2003 she was part of the Vasl Residency in Karachi where she undertook a work called Loco Foco Moto; This work tells about the india-pakistan hostility, keeping in mind their own family history related to the Partition of India
 These works were different from their usual symbolic works, they involved a bit more craftsmanship because they used matchsticks and glue to make chandeliers
 These ornate chandeliers, made from thousands of unburned matchsticks, symbolize creation and destruction, an important element of Hindu beliefs; This is a feature of his works that portrays the co-existence of violence and beauty

 For about one and a half years, Unani system of medicine was known to different linguistic castes such as Christian, Jewish, Tarpujic, Iranian, Kuldani, Egyptian and Surayani
 jab in granthon kaa arabi main anuwaad ho gaya tab musalamaanon ne is vidya ko siikhnaa prarambh kiya, tab anek vishwavikhyath, hakimon jaise raji or shaikh, kaa pradurbhaav hua
 Following are the basic principles of Unani medicine: ilmetib shaastra he jisase maanavsharir kii swasth tathaa aswasth avasthaaon kaa gyaan hota he or yah shaastra bataata he ki swasthya kii raksha kaise kii ja sati he tathaa rogavastha main rog kaa nivaaran kaise ho saktaa he
 Human health depends on the natural and unnatural state of the elements from which the human body is made
 in tatwon ko unani chikitsak umoor mukabwema, yaa ajazaai mukavvema, kehete hai
 Man's existence depends on these elements
 jab tak ye tatv apni prakritik avasthaa main rahete hai, tab tak maanav sharir apana kaary niyamit rup se karata he
 This is called health
 in mul tatwon par hi maanav prakruti kii utpatti nirbhar karti he, di in tatwon main ek bhi na rahe, to maanav sharir kii sthiti asambhav ho jaaygi
 Umur Tbiyyya is called dosha-sinterology in Ayurveda and Physiology in Allopathy
 umoor tabiiyya main saat tatwon kaa samavesh he: These are the cool components of the body, or products from which humans are made
 ilm manafedl aajaa main inhen padaartho kaa nirupan hua karata he
 The Greeks divided all the composition of the body into two major parts, the liquid and the non-volatile, the non-volatile constituent is not the substance
 yah dravyabhoot ghatakon ke aashray se rahanevaala unka gundharm he
 Leaving these, the liquid components remain only four, of which the basic components of the liquid liquid components are also eliminated
 ise chhod dene par keval teen dravyabhoot ghatak, akhlaat, aaza or arvaah rah jate he
 The Greeks divided all the constitutive elements of the body into three classes from the point of view: shaikhurrais ne unani vaidyak ke samast pratipaadya vishyon or unke ang pratyangon kaa apane suprasidv granth, al kanoon ke praarabhik adhyyon main vishad vivaran diya hai
 It has also been told in this book, which subjects Hakim needs to know how much and in which subjects direct, experience and testing are required
 shaikh mahoday kulliyaat kanoon kii duusari fasal maujaat tib main fermaaten hai : Since the Unani Vedic scriptures represent the human body with a view to health and unhealth, and knowledge of everything is acquired at the same time, provided that the cause of that object is, it is necessary that in Unani Vedic scripture, health And for unhealthy, their reasons should be known
 chunki swasthya tathaa unke nidaan kaaran kabhi vyakti evam prakat hote hai or kabhi avyakt evam aprakat, jo gyanedriyon se gyaat nahin kiye ja sakate pratyut unke gyaan ke liye updrav evam lakshan ke pathpradarshan kii apeksha hua karti hai, isaliye yah bhi anivaary ho gaya ki unani vaidyak shaastra main swastheavastha evam aswastheavastha main hone vaale un updravon evam lakshanon kaa ullekh kiya jaay jinase ham swasthya evam aswasthya arthath rog ke pahchaanane main samarth ho jaate hai
 In उloom Hakikia it is said that knowledge of an object is gained due to its diagnostic reasons
 yadi uske nidaan kaaran na ho, to uske nijee lakshanon ke gyaan se kuch seemaa tak uskaa pataa lag jaataa hai
 There are four distinctions of Asbag in the Greek texts
 ye hai : asbab maddiya, asbab faelia, asbab suriya or asbab tamaamia, yaa gaia
 Health and disease are enshrined in the Basbaab Madiya
 iske bhi do upbhed he: 1
 sannikrusht or viprakrusht 
 Adjacent diagnostics are limbal, ooze and air, and specific diagnoses are quadriceps and quadriplegia
 asabaab faelia ve kaaran hai, jo maanav sharir ke bheetar parirvatan karte hen, yaa unki raksha karaten hai
 Asabab Suriya has three strains: 1
 Nature, 2
 Force and 3
 Organization
 prakruti, bal or sanghathan ke yathavat rahane se bahya swasthya paaya jaataa hai
 Deformation of any one of these three causes diseases
 asbab tamaamia sharir kriyaayein hai
 The following subjects are described in the Sutra Unani Vaidyakas: superlative nature, dosha, abhinavarava, samyamravaivya, prana and ooze, force, health and unhealthy and meditative conditions, malaise, or physical condition and underwritten diagnosis due to food, drink, air , Water, country and place, resources, erections, occupation, nature, female and mental work, non-function, various air sex, other body parts The subject matter, health protection, method of food and drink for prevention of each disease, estimation of Chesta unconscious, benefit from medicines, handicrafts and surgery
 inamen kuch to aise hai jinhen hakim ko bina tark ke maan lenaa chahie or kuch aise hai jinhen tark or yukti se sidv karnaa hota hai
 In Vaidya Shastra some subjects have been adopted from other scriptures, it is compulsory for Vaidya to accept the nature of such subjects without reason and logic
 ang pratyang or unke karm to gyanendriyon or shavchchanden evam shalyakarm se gyaat kiye jaate hai
 Sheikh says, the subjects which are necessary to know and prove in a doctor with logic and logic, are the diseases, their diagnosis, causes and their symptoms and this is how to cure the disease and how health protection can be done
 
 ye vishay aise hen ki unamem se jinka astiv spasht evam nishchit na ho, unako samay or pramaan- varnanasah tark evam yukti - se vistaarpurvak siddh karnaa aavashyak hai
 From the description of Sheikh, where we get a brief knowledge of all the representations and theories of the Greek scientist, there is also a knowledge of the subject that these ancient scholars had the tools available in that early and simple era for direct knowledge
 These industries have not taken up any matter in getting their work done with all their strength and strength
 kapitay sidvanto kaa badalanaa or vibhinn anveshak kaa vibhinn kaal main vibhinn nishkarsh par pahunchnaa, ek abaadh niyam hai
 This has always been the case with Western scientific subjects as well
 jo baat ek samay akatya satya samajhi jaati thi, vah nae sadhano, upkarnon or khojon se anek baar asaty pramanit hui hai
 Even after the direct knowledge, it is possible to forget from those who perform the geoscopy, so even ancient scholars cannot escape from this rule
 apni samarthy ke anusaar prakruti ke niyamon kaa adhyayan evam nirikshan unhonen kiya
 After direct experimentation or experience, some conclusions were established, some of them proved to be false by previous experiments and experiences
 isse ham un pracheen vidwaanon ko dosha nahin de sakaten
 According to Shaikhurais, disease is done by retaliation for retribution
 ise elaj vijjid keethan hai
 The same basic principles are also with other medical systems
 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga The Puranas are a treatise on Hinduism
 jinamein sristi, lay, pracheen rishiyon, muniyon or raajaaon ke vrittaat aadi hai
 These are the later texts of the Vedic period, which come under the Department of Smriti
 bhartiya jivan-dhara main jin granthon kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he unamem puraana bhakthi-granthon ke rup main bahut mahatvapurn maane jate hai
 In eighteen Puranas, different gods and goddesses have been described as the centers of sin and virtue, religion and unrighteousness, deeds and actions
 kuch puraanon main sristi ke armbh se ant tak kaa vivaran kiya gaya he
 'purana' literally means 'ancient' or 'old'
 puraanon kii rachana mukhyatah sanskrit main hui he kintu kuch puraana kshetreey bhashaaon main bhi rache gaye hai
 Puranas are found in respect of both Hindu and Jain religions
 puraanon main varnit vishyon kii koi seemaa nahin he
 It describes cosmology, the lineages of deities, kings, heroes, sages, sages, folklore, pilgrimage, temples, medicine, astronomy, grammar, mineralogy, humor, love stories, as well as theology and philosophy
 vibhinn puraanon kii vishay-vastu main bahut adhik asamanta he
 Not only this, many manuscripts of the same Purana have been received which are different from each other
 hindu puraanon ke rachanaakaar agyaat hai or aisa lagata he ki kai rachanakaaron ne kai shatabdiyon main inaki rachana kii he
 In contrast, the Jain Puranas can be described as the creation of the Jain Puranas and the names of the creators
 karmkand se gyaan kii ore aate hue bhartiya maanas main puraanon ke madhyam se bhakthi kii aviral dhara pravaahit hui he
 In the same process of development, Manas gradually moved towards Avatarism or Saguna Bhakti by the formative interpretation of polytheism and Nirguna Brahma
