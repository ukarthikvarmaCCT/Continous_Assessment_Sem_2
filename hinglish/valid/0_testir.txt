 In the Greek New Testament, Judas is called Ιούδας Ισκάριωθ and Ισκαριώτης
 "juds ", saadhaaran naam judah kaa greek rup he se us kahani ko savistaar bataata he jo chaandi ke tees tukdon ke bhugtan kii vaapasi ko ullikhit karata he
 Several authors such as Augustine, Jerome, and John Calvin have concluded that this was an obvious error

 There are many explanations for why Judas betrayed Jesus
 ek saamaanya vyakhya he ki juds ne chaandi ke 30 tukdon ke liye yishu ko dhokhaa diya 
 juds kii pramukh kamajoriyon main se ek kamajori paisa thi 
 ek anya sambhavit kaaran he ki juds ko ummid thi ki yishu israel ke roman shashan ko ukhaad phenkege

 Luke 22:3-6 or John 13:27 ke anusaar, shaitan ne usamen pravesh kiya or use aisa karne ke liye kaha
 Gospel suggests that Jesus had already learned both and allowed Judas to betray
 One explanation is that Jesus allowed the betrayal to happen because it would allow God's plan to be fulfilled
 In April 2006, a Coptic papyrus manuscript of 200 AD, titled Gospel of Judas, was translated into modern language and stated that he might have suggested that Jesus himself would have told Judas to cheat, although some Scholars have questioned the translation
 aurigen ko ek parampara ke bare main pataa tha jiske anusaar shishyon kii ek badi sankhya ne yishu ko dhokhaa diya, lekin isaki jimmedaari juds par vishesh rup se nahin di jaati or aurigen juds ko puri tarah bhrasht nahin maanate 
 Judas has also been the subject of several philosophical writings, including The Problem of Natural Evil by Bertrand Russell and "three Versions of Judas", a short story by George Louis Borges
 Both allege that there are various problematic ideological contradictions due to the discrepancy between the actions of Judas and his eternal punishment
 jon es phenberg kaa tark he ki yadi yishu ko juds dwaara vishwasghaat kii jaankaree thi to yah vishwasghaat swatantra ichha kaa kaary nahin he or isliye dandaneey nahin hona chahie
 iske vipareet, yah tark diya gaya he ki sirf isliye ki vishwasghaat hone kii pehle se hi jaankaree thi, yah baat juds ko apni swayan kii ichha kaa prayog karne se nahin rokatii he
 Other scholars argue that Judas followed God's will
 dharmagranth kaa suzav he ki juds, ishwar ke uddeshyon kii purti ke saath jahiraa taur par bandhaa hua tha, yet wo ij apon him or usne behatar hota ki janm hi nahin liya hota

 is kshamapraarthi drushtikon kaa yah parinaam he ki juds kii is karrwai ko aavashyak or aprihaary ke rup main dekha jaataa he, jo phir bhi ninda kaa paatr he
 Erasmus believed that Judas was free to change his mind, but Martin Luther argued in rebuttal that Judas' wish was unshakeable
 jon kelvin ne kaha he ki juds kaa dhikkaar kaa paatr bananaa purvanirdhaarit tha, lekin juds ke aparaadh ke sawaal par likhte hai: "


 nishchit rup se juds ke vishwasghaat main, yah sahi nahin hoga, kyonki swayan bhagwaan kii ichha thi ki unke bete ko upar pahunchaaya jaae or unhen mrityu praapt hui, bhagwaan ko is aparaadh ke liye doshi tehraane kii jagah juds ko is rin-mochan kaa shrey sthanantarit kiya gaya"
 It has been speculated that Judas's condemnation, which seems possible from Gospel's text, may have actually stemmed not from his betrayal to Jesus, but from the despair that led him to later suicide
 This situation is not without its own problems because it had become a condemnation by Jesus even before Judas committed suicide, but it does end with the contradiction that Judas's predestined function is both salvation and its downfall for all mankind Paves it

 " Most Christians still consider Judas a traitor

 Some scholars have adopted the alternative notion that Judas was the only negotiator in a pre-arranged prisoner transaction under which mutual agreement gave Jesus to the Roman authorities and noted that Judas's later portrayal as a "traitor" is historically Deformation

 Apparently not, because in John 20:24 we know that he was Thomas
 isliye gyaarah main juds ko shaamil hona chahie
 iske alaava, paul 1 Corinthians 15:5 main kehete hai ki apane punerjeevit hone ke baad yishu ko "baarah" ne dekha
 isamen juds ko shaamil hona chahie kyonki arohan ke baad hi, yani kareeb chalis din baad, kisi anya vyakti, mathiyas ko juds ko pratisthapit karne ke liye vot diya gaya

 John Shelby Spong's book The Sins of the Scripture explores the possibility that early Christians compiled the Judas story from the three Jewish betrayal stories of the Old Testament
 ve likhte hai, "


 baarah shishyon main se ek sadsy dwaara vishwasghaat karne kii charchaa aarambhik isai lekhan main nahin miltaa he
 Judas is first introduced into the Christian story by the Gospel of Mark, writing in the early eighth decade of the Common Era "
 He explains that some gospel, after the crucifixion, were given the number of disciples"
 Twelve ", as Judas was still among them
 ve juds kii maut ke teen paraspar virdohi vivaran kii tulana karte hai - faansee, ek gadde main gir kar or pet fatne se, jahaan teen old testament dhokhe ke baad isi tarah kii aatmahatya kii charchaa he
 Spong's conclusion is that after the First jewish-roman War, early biblical writers tried to distance themselves from the enemies of Rome
 He augmented the scripture by adding the story of a disciple, who emerged in Judas as a Jewish state, who either betrayed Jesus or handed over to the Roman persecutors
 Spong identifies this promotion as the father of modern anti-semitism

 mcclintick not only presents Judas as a "beloved disciple", but also as a clerk and author of the 'Q' document, as a true author of "apocalypse Creed" and "john Gospel"
 mcclintic presents Judas as the source of most of the narratives related to Jesus in the Gospel, including the story of Jesus' birth, his teachings, his teachings and religion from his trial, crucifixion and resurrection

 In December 2007, a New York Times editorial article by Epril deconick stated that the translation of National Geographic is quite faulty, for example, in one case National Geographic transcription Judas refers to a "daimon" that society experts Has translated as "spirit"
 haalanki, "aatma" ke liye saarvbhaumik rup se sweekrut shabd "neuma" he - rahasywaadee sahitya main "dimon" kaa arth hameshaa "shaitan" hi samajha jaataa he
 The National Geographic Society responded that 'almost all translation-related issues raised by April D
 Deconic have been answered in footnotes in both popular and important editions'
 In a later review of this issue and relevant publications, critic Joan Akosela questioned whether secret intentions had not begun to dominate historical analysis, for example, the publication of The Gospel of Judas to bring back the ancient anti-jewish stigmas
 There may be an attempt

 According to medieval copies of the Gospel of Barnabas, it was Judas who was crucified, not Jesus
 The work described that the appearance of Judas was changed to Jesus, when Judas in treachery assisted the Roman soldiers to arrest Jesus, but by then Jesus had left for heaven
 yah swaroop parivartan itnaa samaan tha ki aam janata, messiah ke anuyaayiyon or yahaan tak ki yishu kii maa mariyam, ne shuru main sochaa ki jis vyakti ko giraftaar kiya gaya or cross par chadhaaya gaya, vah yishu hai
 Gauspell then mentions that three days after the burial, Judas 'body was stolen from his grave and rumors of Jesus' resurrection then spread
 jab yishu ko tisare swarg main bataaya gaya ki kya hua to unhone parameshwar se prarthana kii ki unhen waapas prithvi ke liye bheja jaae or isliye ve aae or unhone apni maa, shishyon or anuyaayiyon ko ikattha kiya or unhen sachai bataai ki kya hua or yah bataakar ve waapas swarg chale gaye or bas ant main ek raja ke rup main waapas aaenge

 In the Eastern Orthodox songs of Holy Wednesday, Judas was compared to women who anointed Jesus with expensive perfumes and washed their feet with their tears
 According to the Gospel of John, Judas opposed this apparent wastage and said that the money spent on it should be given to the poor
 After this, Judas went to the head priest and offered to betray Jesus for money
 Holly Weddensday compares these two characters and encourages believers to avoid the fallen disciple and rather to follow Mary's example of remorse

 The platypus, also known as the duckling platypus, is a mammal living in eastern Australia
 yah stanadhariyon ke monotream gana kii paanch gyaat jatiyon main se ek he, jo standhari hone ke naate apane shishuon ko doodh to pilaate hai lekin jinamein mata garbh dhaaran karne kii bajaae ande detii he
 These are the only five species that lay eggs in the entire mammalian community
 kramavikas kii drushti se yah bahut mahatvapurn hai kyonki yah jatiyaan us samay kaa sanket hai jab standhari naye-naye viksit ho rahe the or unamem garbh main shishu viksit karne kii kshamta utpann nahin hui thi
 Therefore, they are also placed in the category of living fossils
 jab san 1999 main europea jeevvaigyanikon ne sabase pehle ek platipus kaa mrit sharir dekha to uske battakh jaisi thuthan, biver jaisi moti-chapati dum or udbilav jaise pair dekhakar unhone aise praani kaa astitv maanane se inkaar kar diya or alag-alag praaniyon ke angon ko jodakar dhokhaa dene kaa aarope lagaaya
 Platypus is one of the very few mammals that can protect themselves from venom
 nar platipus ke pichhali pairon kii edi par ek kanta bana hota he jise khobakar vah anya praani main vish daal saktaa he
 If a human feels it, then death usually does not happen, but there is a terrible agony
 mana jaataa he ki jaise platipuson main sarisrupon kii bhaanti anden dene kii pravriti bachi hui thi usee prakaar usamen vifaille hone kii pravriti jari thi
 This property disappeared in further developing mammals
 dolphin ko chhodkar, monotream akele standhari hai jinamein vidyutbhaan kii shakti he, yani ve apane grass praaniyon kii mansapeshiyon main prayog hone vaale vidyut kaa bodh kar sakate hai
 Platypus uses neither sight nor sniffing power to hunt
 jab vah jalsamooh main jaataa he to aankh, kaan or naak band kar letaa he
 In springs and rivers, he goes down and presses himself into the soil in the floor
 phir vidyutbhaan ke dwaara use pataa hota he ki paas se nikalne vaali koi vastu jivit he yaa koi ajivit chiz he
 He grabs as soon as the eligible grass comes near
 prayogon main dekha gaya he ki yadi ek kritrim zinga banaakar usamen se vidyut nikaali jaae to platipus use pakadaney kii koshish karata he or bina vidyut ke usapar dhyaan bhi nahin detaa
 Socialism is an economic-social philosophy
 samaajawaadee vyavastha main dhan-sampatti kaa swaamitv or vitaran samaaj ke niyantran ke adheen rahete hai
 Socialism opposes rights based on private property as economic, social and ideological suffixes
 uski ek buniyadi pratigya yah bhi he ki smapda kaa utpaadan or vitaran samaaj yaa rajya ke haathon main hona chahie
 In the modern sense of politics, socialism is seen as contrary to the principle of capitalism or free market
 ek raajnneetik vichaardhaara ke rup main samaajwaad europe main atharahavin or unnisvin sadi main ubhare udyogikaran kii anyonyakriya main viksit hua he
 British political scientist Harold Loskey once called socialism a cap that anyone wears
 samaajwaad kii vibhinn kismein loski ke is chithran ko kaaphi seemaa tak roopayit karti he
 a variety of socialism is a reflection of the totalitarian control of the disintegrated Soviet Union, in which all possible aspects of human life were urged to bring the state under control
 uski duusari kism rajya ko arthvyavastha ke niyaman dwaara kalyankari bhoomika nibhaane kaa mantra detii he
 a different form of socialism has been tried in India
 raamamanohar lohia, jai prakaash narayan or narendra dev ke raajnneetik chintan or vyavhaar se nikalne vaale pratyay ko 'gandhivaadi samaajwaad' kii sangya di jaati he
 Socialism is the Hindi version of the English and French words 'socialism'
 19veen shatabdi ke purvardh main is shabd kaa prayog vyaktvaad ke virodh main or un vichaaron ke samarthan main kiya jaataa tha jinka lakshya samaaj ke aarthik or naitik aadhaar ko badalanaa tha or jo jivan main vyaktigat niyantran kii jagah saamaajik niyantran sthapit karnaa chaahate the
 The term socialism is used in many and sometimes conflicting contexts; Such as groupism anarchism, primitive tribal communism, military communism, Christian socialism, cooperativeism, etc
 - even the Natsi party had the full name 'national Socialist Party'
 samaajwaad kii paribhaasha karnaa kathin he
 It is both a principle and a movement and it takes different forms in different historical and local circumstances
 mulat: yah vah andolan he jo utpaadan ke mukhya sadhano ke samajikaran par aadhaarit vargvihin samaaj sthapit karne ke liye prayatnsheel he or jo majdoor varg ko iskaa mukhya aadhaar banaata he, kyonki vah is varg ko shoshit varg maanata he jiskaa aitihaasik kaary vargavyavastha kaa ant karnaa he
 In a primitive communist society, humans used to get the necessary things by mutual cooperation and divide them among the needs of each member
 parantu yah samyawad prakritik tha; manushya kii sachet kalpana par aadhaarit nahin tha
 The way of living of the early Christian clergy was very communist, they lived together and equally, but the source of their income was the donation of the religious and their ideal was not limited to the masses but only to the clergy
 unka uddeshy bhi aadhyatmik tha, bhautik nahin
 The same is true of medieval Christian communism
 piru desh kii pracheen inkaa sabhyataa ko 'sainya samyawad' kii sangya di jaati he, parantu uskaa aadhaar sainya sanghathan tha or vah vyavastha shaasha varg kaa hitsaadhan karti thi
 The attainment of the means of public service by the municipalities, or the mere use of economic schemes for the advancement of the country, cannot be called socialism, because capitalism is not necessarily hurt by them
 natsi dal ne bainkon kaa rashtrikaran kiya tha parantu poonjeewaadi vyavastha akshunn rahi
 Radical movements such as the levellers and diggers developed during the seventeenth century in England and radical movements such as the Anabaptists developed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in the Middle East in England have been instrumental in building the emotional structure of socialism
 lekin samaajwaad kii aadhunik or aupchaarik pariklpana francisi vichaarkon sain-simon or charles furiye tathaa british chintak rabart oven kii nishpattiyon se nikalati he
 These early thinkers of socialism imagined a society based on mutual cooperation rather than individualism and competition
 unhen vishwaas tha ki maanviya swabhaav or samaaj kaa vigyaan garh kar saamaajik taane-bane ko behatar rup diya ja saktaa he
 But there were many differences between them regarding concrete details of desired social forms, strategy to achieve them and understanding of human nature
 udhaaharan ke liye, sain-simon tathaa furiye ruso ke is mat se sahamat nahin the ki manushya kii prakruti apni banaavat main to acchhee, udaatt or vivekpurna he lekin aadhunik samaaj or nijee sampatti ne use bhrasht kar diya he
 His argument against this was that there are certain fixed and definite forms of human nature that can be reconciled on the basis of mutual cooperation
 oven kaa mat sain-simon or furiye se bhi alag tha
 He said that human nature is determined by external conditions and can be given the desired form
 isliye samaaj kii paristhitiyon ko is tarah badla janaa chahie ki manushya kii prakruti purnataa kii ore bad sake
 According to him, if mutual cooperation and unity will be promoted in place of competition and individualism, then the whole of humanity can be benefited
 samaajwaad kii raajnneetik vichaardhaara unnisvin sadi ke tisare or chauthe dashakon ke dauraan england, frans tathaa germany jaise europee deshon main lokapriy hone lagi thi
 The rapid pace of industrialization and urbanization and the decline of traditional society had made European society an arena of reform and change forces, with groups ranging from trade unions and charterist groups active to advocating pre-modern communalism in place of modern society Were
 marks or angels dwaara pratipaadit vaigyanik samaajwaad kaa vichaar saamaajik or raajnneetik uthalputhal kii isi prishthbhumi main viksit hua tha
 Marx drew inspiration from the ideas of saan-simo, Furie, and Owen, but declared his socialism to be 'imaginary' in comparison to his 'scientific' socialism
 in purvavarti chintakon kii tarah marks samaajwaad ko koi aisa adarsh nahin maanate ki uskaa spasht kaakaa khinchaa jaae
 Marx and Engels see socialism as a situation arising out of the functioning of capitalism rather than any self-land theory
 unka maananaa tha ki samaajwaad kaa koi bhi rup aitihaasik prakriya se hi ubharegaa
 Due to this understanding, Marx and Engels were also reluctant to elaborate or define socialism
 unke liye samaajwaad mukhyatah poonjeewaad ke nakaar main khadaa pratyay tha jise ek lambi krantikari prakriya ke zariye apni pahchaan khud gadhani thi
 Marx's most important work about socialism is the 'critique of the Gotha Program', in which he has interpreted socialism as the intermediate stage of two phases of communist society
 gauratlab he ki marks kii is rachana kaa prakaashan unki mrityu ke aath saal baad hua tha
 Till then it was not given much importance in Marxist theories
 is vimarsh ko marxvad ke mul siddhanton main shaamil karne kaa shrey lenin ko jaataa he, jinhone apni kriti 'state and revolution' main marks ke hawaale se samaajwaad ko samyavaadee samaaj kii rachana main pehla yaa nimnatar charan bataaya
 After Lenin, socialism was configured in Marxist terminology in such a way that any person or party could call themselves socialist or communist without any particular ideological problem
 is vimarsh kii vibhaajak rekha is baat se tay hoti thi ki kisi dal yaa vyakti ke liye krantikari gatividhiyon kaa taatkaalik or doorgaami lakshya kya he
 That is, if someone called himself a socialist, then it meant that he emphasizes the first phase of the creation of a communist society
 yahi vajah he ki kai samaajawaadee deshon main shashan karne vaale dal jab khud ko communist ghoshit karte the to ise asangat nahin mana jaataa tha
 The international spread of socialism in the twentieth century and the Soviet system of governance are considered to be concurrent phenomena
 yah ek aisa tathy he jisane samaajwaad ke vichaar or uske bhavishya ko gaharaai se prabhavit kiya he
 For example, after the revolution, the Soviet Union became synonymous with socialism for both its supporters and critics
 soviet samarthakon kii daleel yah thi ki utpaadan ke pramukh sadhano ke samajikaran, bazaar ko kendrikrut niyojan ke maatahat karne, tathaa videsh vyapaar va gharelu vitt par rajya ke niyantran jaise upaay apnaane se soviet sangh bahut kam avadhi main ek audyogic desh ban gaya
 While its critics said that it was a publicized image because the vast bureaucracy, political repression, inequality and neglect of democracy were enough to reject the ideal of socialism itself
 samaajwaad ke prasar main soviet sangh kii duusari bhoomika ek sanghathankarta kii thi
 By establishing an organization like Communist International for the spread of socialist revolution, he proved himself to be the vanguard of socialism
 is sanghathan ne vishwa kii communist partiyon kaa lambe samay tak disha-nirdesan kiya
 The third aspect of the role of the Soviet Union was that it established many similar administrative systems in Eastern Europe
 antat soviet sangh samaajwaad kii prayogshaala isliye bhi mana gaya kyonki roosi kranti ke baad stallin ke netritv main yah siddhant prachaarit kiya gaya ki samaajawaadee kranti kaa anya deshon main prasar karne se pehle use ek hi desh main majboot kiya janaa chahie
 To many scholars, this was a formulation that legitimized the emergence of many varieties of National Socialism
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad shuru hui vi-upniveshikaran kii prakriya ke dauraan samaajwaad or rashtrawaad kaa yah sanshray teesri duniya ke deshon main samaajwaad ke vikaas kaa ek praaroop sa ban gaya
 This was a central tendency of the spread of socialism in countries such as China, Vietnam and Cuba
 soviet samarthit samaajwaad ke alaava uskaa ek anya rup bhi he jisane poonjeewaadi deshon ko apratyaksh dhang se prabhavit kiya he
 For example, to counterbalance the logic and attractiveness of socialism, the capitalist countries of the west had to change the mold of their economy and give it a welfare form
 is sandarbh main scandenevian deshon, pashchimi europe tathaa austrailesia kshetra ke deshon main kines ke lokopkaaree vichaaron se prerit hokar soviet tarz ke samaajwaad kaa vikalp gadhane kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 These welfare measures, based on demand management, economic nationalism, guarantee of employment, and the policy of keeping the social services sector free from profiteering tendencies, had once blurred the gap between capitalism and socialism
 rajya ke is kalyankari model ko ek samay poonjeewaad kii visangatiyon— bekaari, berojgaare, abhaav, agyaan aadi kaa sthai ilaaj bataaya ja rahaa tha
 The evidence of the economic and political success of this model can be considered that if these measures were praised in the left circles then even the right wing politics could not openly oppose them
 duusare vishwa-yuddh kii samaapti ke baad teen dashakon tak bazaar kendrit samaajwaad kaa yah model kaaphi prabhaavshaalee dhang se kaam karata rahaa
 But in the seventh decade, questions about the appropriateness of this model began to arise due to the double hit of recession and inflation and the increasing social and industrial dissatisfaction in the bastion of welfare capitalism
 marxvaadi shivi ke vidwaan bhi lagaataar yah kehete aa rahe the ki kalyankari bhangimaaon ne asamanta or shoshan ko khatm karne ke bajaay poonjeewaad ko hi majboot kiya he
 One objectionable aspect of this model was also the manifestation that the state was put in a position to control it by the machinery providing basic amenities of life to the working class
 bazaar ko kaayam rakhte hue samaajwaad ke kuch tattvon par amal karne vaale is model kaa nav-udaarataavaadi buddhijivi shuru se hi virodh karte aaye the
 In the seventh decade, this class began to loudly say that socialism not only makes the economy root but also takes away the freedom of the individual
 nawein dashak main jab soviet sangh ke saath purvi europe kii samaajawaadee vyavasthaayen ek ke baad ek dhahne lagi to samaajwaad kii is aalochana ko vyapak vaidhata milane lagi or samaajwaad ke saath itihaas ke ant kii bhi baaten kii jane lagi
 In the frenzy of victory, the liberal intellectuals also said that capitalism is the only option for humanity, so now forgetting about its alternative, it should be thought only that what can be another form of capitalism
 karl marks ke saathi angills ne apane purv prachlit aadhunik samaajwaad ke praarambhik dhaaraon ko kaalpanaalokeey samaajwaad kaa naam diya
 The basis of these ideas was moral, not physical and scientific; Their thinkers believed in reformist means of achieving the goal; And used to imagine a broad but unrealistic vision of future society
 inamen saan siimon, charles furiye, or robert oven aadi ke samaajawaadee vichaar sammilit kiya gaya he
 {main} Scientific Socialism}} britain main fabian sosayadi kii sthapana san 1883-84 i
 main hui
 Under the influence of Robert Owen and the Chartist movement, the foundation of the independent labor movement was laid here, the Fabian Society saw this movement
 is sabha kaa naam fabius kanctator fabian ke naam se liya gaya he
 Fabius was a fighter from ancient Rome who fought patiently in the struggle against Hannibal, the famous general of Carthage, and was defeated over the years by Guerilla policy
 isi prakaar fabian samaajwaadiyon kaa vichaar he ki poonjeewaad ko keval ek muthbhed main krantikari maarg dwaara parrast nahin kiya ja saktaa
 This requires considerable thought and preparation
 inkaa tarika vikaas or sudhaarwadi he
 Before the establishment of the independent working party, they wanted to enter the various political parties of Britain and fulfill their purpose
 inkaa mukhya dhyey charam naitik sambhaavnaaon ke anusaar samaaj kaa punarnirmaan tha
 They consider the state as a social instrument rather than a tool of class governance through which social welfare and socialism are possible
 in vichaarkon ne na keval sansad varan nagarpalika or gramin kshetreey parishadon dwaara bhi samaajawaadee prayogon kaa kaarykram apanaaya
 Therefore, their ideas are called democratic, parliamentary, ballot box, octroi, development or reformist socialism
 in vichaarkon main pramukh sidney web, jaaj barnad shaw, kol, eni besent, graham walas ityadi hai
 These thinkers are deeply influenced by the ideas of the British tradition, utilitarianism, Robert Owen, Christian Socialism and the Chartist movement and the economists of John Stuart Mill
 germany kaa punraritivaad britain ke fabiaswad tathaa germany kii parivartit paristhatiyon se prabhavit hua tha
 The form of Germany and the former European society was feudalistic and democratic of the state and autocratic, so until the late 19th century the socialist ideas here were fierce revolutionary and organization conspiratorial
 in deshon par marks ke vichaaron kaa prabhaav tha
 But at the end of the 19th century, there was also industrial progress in Germany and the state accepted certain personal and political rights
 falat: mazdooron kaa jeevanaster unchaa hua tathaa unke raajnneetik dal - saamaajik loktantrvaadi party kaa prabhaav, bhi badha
 Many of its members became Members of Parliament
 is sthiti main yah bal siddhantat: marks ke krantikari maarg ko sweekaar karte hue bhi vyavhaar main sudhaarwadi ho gaya
 Eduard Bernstein attempted to revise Marxism on the basis of this reality
 bernstin saamaajik lotantravaadi party kaa pramukh darshanik or angills kaa nikat shishy tha
 He was exiled in Britain for many years and was influenced by Fabiusism
 marks kaa kathan tha ki paraspar pratiyogita or aarthik sankaton ke kaaran poonjeewaadi tathaa madhyavarg sankuchit hota jayega or majdoor varg nirdhan, vistrut, sangathit tathaa krantikari banataa jayega jisase sheeghra hi samaajwaad kii sthapana sambhav ho sakegi
 The situation was the opposite, which Bernstein accepted, and on this basis, he insisted on class-cooperation in the place of class struggle and on the communal and constitutional path for the success of social reform and socialism in the place of revolutionary program
 vah marks ke aitihaasik bhautikwaad ke sthaan par naitik tathaa anaarthik tatwon ke prabhaav ko bhi sweekaar karne laga
 Bernstein's ideas were given to repetitionism
 yadhyapi german majdoor andolan vyavhaar main sudhaarwadi rahaa tathaapi karl kautski ke netritv main usne bernstin ke sanshodhano kaa asweekaar karke marks ke vichaaron main vishwaas prakat kiya
 Fabius and recapitalist thinkers consider the state necessary for the establishment of socialism
 samyavaadee vichaarak bhi sankraman kaal ke liye adam kii shakti kaa prayog karnaa chaahate hai
 Hence, they are called collectivists
 araajaktaavaadi vichaarak bhi poonjeewaad virdohi or samaajwaad ke samarthak hai parantu ve rajya, raajnneeti or dharm ko shoshanvyavastha kaa samarthak maanate hai or aarambh se hi inkaa ant kar dena chaahate hai
 Anarchism is a theory of life and conduct that envisions a society without rule
 yah samaaj ke aikya kii sthapana shashan or kanoon dwaara nahin, varan vyakti tathaa sthaneey or vyavsaayik samoohon ke swatantra samjhauton dwaara karnaa chahta he
 According to this idea, many human needs of production, distribution etc
 can be fulfilled by the above mentioned groups
 araajaktaa shabd ke francisi roopaantar kaa prayog pehali baar francisi kranti ke samay un krantikariyon ke liye kiya gaya tha jo saamanton kii jameen ko jabt karke kisaanon main baantna or dhanikon kii aay ko simit karnaa chaahate the
 Then in 1840, the French thinker Prudhों used the term in his book "what is property?"
 san 1871 ke baad jab antarrashtriya majdoor sangh main foot padi tab marks ke sanghavaadi virodhiyon ko araajaktaavaadi kaha gaya
 Terrorism and anarchism are synonyms in the language of the day; But in fact, philosophical anarchists are only in favor of terror and revolutionary measures against state repression
 sansar kaa pratham araajaktaavaadi vichaarak chini darshanik lao tse mana jaataa he
 These ideas are also embedded in the philosophy of ancient Greek thinkers Aristippus and Gino
 britain kaa godwin or francisi prudhon rajya or shashansansthaaon-nyaayalay aadi kaa virodh karte the
 According to Prudh, property is stolen goods
 vah shram ke aadhaar par panya vinimay or lenden main ek pratishat byaaj kii dar ke paksh main tha
 The views of Russia's three anarchists are important in this regard
 bakunin krantikari araajaktaavaadi tha, pinras cropotkin vaigyanik araajaktaavaadi tathaa leo talsty isai araajaktaavaadi
 The Bakoonin considered the state to be an essential deterrent and a sign of backwardness and a nutrient for property and exploitation
 rajya vyakti kii swadhinata, uski pratibha or krayshakti, uske vivek or naitikta ko simit karata he
 Thus anarchism is the climax of individualism
 bakunin krantikari maarg dwaara rajya or uski sansthaaon police, jail, nyaayalay aadi kaa ant kar swatantra sthaneey sansthaaon kii sthapana ke paksh main tha
 These communities could establish their own national association for mutual cooperation
 ruso or kaant bhi isi prakaar ke swatantra samudaayon or sanghon ke samarthak the
 Kropotkin proved through scientific study that the development of society is towards independent cooperation
 shilpic unnati ke kaaran manushya bahut kam shram dwaara apni aavashyaktaaon kii purti kar sakegaa or shesh samay swatantra jivan vyateet karegaa
 Man is by nature social, therefore a cooperative animal
 swatantraaa or sahyog kii vruddhi ke saath saath rajya kii aavashyaktaa kam ho jaaegi
 Talstoy was also opposed to state and personal property, but was not a nurturer of a violent and revolutionary path, but an advocate of Christian and non-violent methods
 vah buddhisangat isai tha, andhvishwasi nahin
 Talstoy has a deep impression on Gandhiji's thoughts

 Many writers and philosophers have accepted the idea of independence
 inamen jon stuart mil, harbart spencer, herold laski or batrend rasal ke naam mukhya hai
 Intellectual supporters of this ideology were found in many countries like France, Spain, Italy, Russia, Germany, USA, etc
, but the labor movements of France and Britain also accepted these ideas in a revised way
 iske francisi swaroop kaa naam sindikawaad or british kaa gild samaajwaad he
 Syndicism and Guild Socialism originated in the late nineteenth century and the early twentieth
 us samay tak fabius or punraritivaad main mazdooron kaa vishwaas kam hone laga tha
 Democracy failed to solve the problems of the workers, the economic crisis began to take a heavy turn and the chances of war started increasing
 saath hi mazdooron kii sankhya main vruddhi hui, unka sanghathan majboot hua or ve apni maangon ko puraa karaane ke liye bade paimaane par hadtaal karne lage
 Under these circumstances, the working class needed principles of active opposition in place of communal and constitutional methods
 is kami ko uparyukt vichaardhaaraon ne puraa kiya
 Syndicism, like other socialists, is in favor of the socialist system but like anarchists wants social control in the hands of local communities by ending the state
 vah is niyantran ko keval utpaadak varg tak hi simit rakhana chahta he
 Like anarchists, syndicists are also supporters of national and international unions and opposed to the state, political parties, war and militarism

 ye vichaarak udyogon ke rashtriyakaran maatr se santusht nahin kyonki isse naukarshahi kaa bhay he parantu ve rajya kaa ant bhi nahin karnaa chaahate
 After making the state more democratic and decentralized, they want to keep it for the defense of the country and for the benefit of the consumer
 unke anusaar rajkeey sansad main keval kshetreey hi nahin, vyavsaayik pratinidhitiv bhi hona chahie
 They want laborers control over the state and industries, so they are close to syndicism but due to not being anti-state, they also have inclination towards groupism
 ye asafalataa ke bhay se krantikari maarg ko sweekaar nahin karte lekin keval vaidhanik maarg ko bhi aparyaapt samajhate hai or mazdooron ke sakriy andolan, hadtaal aadi kaa bhi samarthan karte hai
 The influence of this ideology increased between and before the First World War
