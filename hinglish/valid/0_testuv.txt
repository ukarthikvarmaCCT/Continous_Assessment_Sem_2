 With a view to developing Hindi as a strong link to the overall cultural expression and coordinated unity of India
 Hindi Vidyapeeth has played a historical role
 hindi viapeeth kii pariklpana karte hue iske preranarot kanhaiyalaal maanik munshi ne kaha tha, "the lovers and scholars of Hindi should concentrate on developing the range and power of Hindi; that higher studies in Hindi must be based on comparative study of Indian languages and literatures, that its strengths and elasticity, rooted in Sanskrit must be strengthened by a core study of that great language
"tab se aaj tak viapeeth hindi bhashaa or sahitya ke bahudishiya vaigyanik adhyayan anusandhan ke kshetra main apane dayitvon kaa safaltaapurvak nirvaah karte hue desh or duniya bhar ke hindi shikshaarthiyon ko shikshan prashikshan pradaan kar rahaa he

 is hotel ko kai saare puraskaron se nawaaza gaya hai, jo nimnlikhit hai: The Mississippi River is the largest riverine in the continent of North America
 yah puri tarah sanyukt rajya america ke kshetra ke bheetar bahati he
 The source of this river is in Lake Itasca in the state of Minnesota, from which it runs south along the curves
 2,320 mile kaa safar tay karke yah mexico kii khadi main nadimukh banaakar vilay ho jaati he
 Many tributaries provide water to Mississippi, and its watershed covers 31 US states and some of southern Canada
 yah nadi vishwa kii chauthi sab se lambi nadi he or pani ke prati-ghante bahaav kii maatra main dasvi sab se badi he
 Mississippi has played a very important role in the history of the United States

 europian upniveshikaran ke baad bahut se europea mul ke log yahan aakar bas gaye or zyaadaatar mul adivaasiyon ko khaded diya yaa maar daalaa gaya
 For some time, this great river remained an obstacle for Europeans to spread further west from here, but gradually it was used for navigational traffic
 yah nadi apane bahaav se apane jalsambar kshetra main itani upjau mitti daalati he ke ise vishwa ke sabase adhik upjau kshetron main gina jaataa he
 This river is considered to be the boundary line between the eastern and western parts of America

 In it this river was called Misi-ziibi, which means "great river"
 yah naam francisi sroton ne bigaadkar "mississippi" kar diya
 Mountain plain island basal gangliya rishadhari jeevon ke mastishk main sthit vibhinn mul ke nabhikon kaa ek samooh he jo ek sanyukt kaaryaatmak ikai ke rup main kaary sampadan karte hai
 They are located in the base region of the anterior part of the brain and are strongly connected to the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and other areas of the brain
 basal gangliya vibhinn kaaryon se jude hote hai, jiname svaichhik gatishiltaa niyantran, dainik aacharan athwa "aadaton" se sambandhit prakriyaatmak shikshan, aankh kii halchal, sangyanatmak evam bhavuk kaary shaamil hai
 Currently popular theories consider the basal ganglia primarily responsible for action selection, that is, deciding which of the various possible behaviors to take place at a time
 prayogtmak adhyayan darshaate hai ki basal gangliya kai gatisheel tantron par nirodhatmak prabhaav daalate hai or is nirodhi prabhaav ke hatate hi gatisheel tantra sakriy ho jaataa he
 The "change of behavior" in the basal ganglia is influenced by signals transmitted from several parts of the brain, including the prefrontal cortex that plays an important role in executive function
 basal gangliya ke mukhya ghatak hai- striatum jise neostriatum bhi kehete hai or jo codet evam putamin se bana hota he, globas palids yaa palidam jo globas palids eksterna yaa globas palids interna se bana hota he, substanshia nigra jo substanshia nigra pars compecta evam substanshia nigra pars reticulata se milakar bana hota he or sabathalemic nabhik 
 striatum, jo sabase bada ghatak he, kai mastishk kshetron se input praapt karata he lekin keval basal gangliya ke anya ghatakon ko hi output bhejtaa he
 The pallidum receives the most important input from the striatum and sends several regions related to inhibitory output dynamics, including the portion of the thalamus that elevates the dynamics-related regions of the cortex
 reticulata jo substenshia nigra kaa ek bhaag he, vah palidam kii hi tarah kaary karata he, evam compecta naamak doosraa hissaa striatum ko neuro transmeter dopamin strot kaa input pradaan karata he
 The subthalamic nucleus receives input mainly from the striatum and cortex and transports part of the pallidum
 in kshetron main se prayek main ek aantarik sanrachanaatmak or neuro-rasinic sanghathan hota he
 The basal ganglia play a central role in various neural states, including many mobility disorders
 sabase ullekhneey hai, parkingsanse rog, jisame substenshia nigra par compecta main melanin pigmented dopamin utpaadak koshikaon kaa patan hota he or hantingtons vikaar jisame multah striatum kshatigrast hoti hai
 Some behavioral control disorders also include dysfunctional states of the basal ganglia, such as, in Torret's syndrome, belismus, obsessive compulsive disorder, and Wilson's disease
 The neuro pathology mechanisms related to Parkinson's disorder and Huntington's disorder apart from Wilson's disease and Hemi bellismus disorder have not been properly understood or are still in the developing theoretical state
 basal gangliya main ek haath-pairon ki tarah dikhaai dene vaala kshetra hota he jiske avyavon ko alag - alag naam die gaye hai- nabhik ekambence, ventral palidam or ventral tegmental kshetra 
 afferents nabhik ekambence ko usee tarah dopamin pradaan karte hai jis tarah substanshia nigra dorcel striatum ko dopamin pradaan karti he
 Since there is a lot of evidence indicating that it has a central role in rare studies, the dopaminergic projection of VTA → NA has attracted a large number of attention
 udhaaharan ke liye, kai atyadhik nashe vaali davaayen jinamein cocaine, amphitamins evam nicotine sammilit hai, inke bare main samajha jaataa he ki ve vitie → ene dopamin sanket ki prabhavakaarita ko badhaakar kaary sampadan karti he
 There is also evidence that VTA → NA dopaminergic projection in insanity is effective upon over-stimulation
 vikaas kii drushti se maanav tantrika tantra kaa vargeekaran aksar 3 mul aadim guhaaon par aadhaarit he
 The said primary cavities are formed during the normal development of the neural tube in the human embryo and initially consist of a rostral to caudal orientation - the procensipheles, mesencephals, and robensipheles
 Later, during the development of the nervous system, each section is converted into smaller components
 nimna talika is vikasaatmak vargeekaran ko darshaati he or basal gangliya main pai jane vaali sharir sanrachana tak anugaman karti he
 : basal gangliya tellencifelone kaa ek buniyadi avyav he
 In contrast, the layer of cortics lining the surface of the forebrain, while the basal ganglia, a distinctly visible group of gray matter, is located near the confluence of the thalamus at the depth of the brain
 mastishk ke adhikansh bhaagon kii tarah, basal gangliya main bhi baayein or daayen paksh hote hai jo ki ek duusare ki abhaasi chhaviyon ke rup main hote he
 From the anatomical point of view, anatomists have divided the basal ganglia into four distinct structures and this division depends on how well the said structures are rostral: two of them ie the striatum and the pallidum are relatively large, the other Two, ie the substencia nigra and subthalamic nucleus are small structures in shape
 dayee ore ke udhaaharan main, maanav mastishk ke do kapaal anubhag maanchitr main basal gangliya ke avyavon kii sthiti darshaayi jaati he
 As a note, it is clarified that, as seen in the above map, the subthalamic nucleus and the substencia are located very posterior to the nigra brain
 striatum basal gangliya kaa sabase bada avyav he
 Stripes are seen when the structure of the striatum is cut in certain directions, many of which appear to be the origin of small and large nerve fibers, hence the term "striatum" is used
 purv ke sharir sanrachana vaigyanikon ne maanav mastishk kaa pareekshan kar samajha tha ki striatum do bhinn-bhinn padaarthon se bana he jinhen aantarik capsule naamak shwet padaarth ke vistaar se pruthak kiya gaya he
 He named these two substances as cadet and putamen
 Modern anatomy scientists concluded by microscopic and neurochemical studies that it is reasonable to consider these substances as two separate parts of the same structure i
e
 the striatum, just as a river separates a city into two
 
 codet evam putamin ki bich kai kaaryaatmak antaron ki pahchaan kii gai he, kintu inhen un tathyon kaa parinaam samajha gaya jinke tahat striatum ke har ek kshetra anivaary rup se pramastishk cortex ke vishisht bhaagon se jude hue paae gaye hai
 The striatum's internal organization is exceptionally complex
 isamen bahutansh neurons "madhyam kantedaar neurons", kism ke hai
 They are gabaergic cells whose cell bodies are small and dendrites are covered with dense dendritic thorns that receive synaptic input from the cortex and thalamus
 neuro rasayan evam jodne ke tareeke ke aadhaar par madhyam kantedaar neurons ko kai tareekon se upaprakaron main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa hai
 The next most multi-numbered type, with large, smooth dendrites, are cholinergic intraurons
 anya or bhi kai prakaar ke aantarik neurons hai, jo neural aabaadi ke chote bhaag hai
 Several studies have shown that there have usually been topographic relationships between the cortex and the striatum, that is, each part of the cortex sends strong input to some part of the striatum, followed by others
 sthalakriti kii prakruti ko samajhnaa mushkil he, lekin, shaayad kuch hisse main kyonki striatum kaa sanghathan teen ayaamon main yojit kiya gaya he jabaki cortex, ek starit sanrachana ke rup main, do main yojit he
 This dimensional discrepancy leads to large amounts of deformation and separation when mapping one structure to another
 dilachasp he ki, vahi sthalakriti sambandh thilemus striatal ke liye lagu hote he
 Pallidum is a large structure called globus pallidus that is located with a small abdominal planar expansion, called the ventral pallidum
 globas palids ekal tantrika padaarth ke rup main prathit hota he, lekin kaaryaatmak bhinnata ke chalate do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he, un hisson ko aantarik bahya khand kaha jaataa he, evam sankshipt main jipiai or jipei bhi kehete hai
 Both segments originally contain gabaergic neurons, which show inhibitory effects on their targets
 ukt do khand alag-alag tantrika paripathon main bhaag lete hai
 The input to the outer segment or GPE is predominantly from the striatum and is projected onto the subthalamus nucleus
 aantarik khand, yaa jipiai, ko do pathon ke madhyam cestrtum dwaara sanket praapt hote hai, jinhen "pratyaksh" or "apratyaksh" path kaha jaataa he
 Pallidal neurons function using a "non-inhibitory" principle
 ukt neurons input ke abhaav main sthir ucch dar se prakshepit hote hai or striatum dwaara sanket ke chalate ve "tehraav" kii sthiti main aa jate hai
 Since the pallidal neurons themselves have inhibitory effects on their targets, the total effect of the input received to the pallidum is reflected in the controlled inhibition exhibited by the pallidal cells on the targets
 sabstantia nigra basal gangliya ke ek missenciphelic grey padaarth kaa bhaag he jo esaenar or esensi main vibhajit he
 Often the SNR works in harmony with the GPI and the SNR - GPI complex performs the anti-function of the thalamus
 sabstantia nigra pars compecta neuro transmeter dopamin kaa nirmaan karata he jo ki striatal path kaa santulan banane main kaaphi mahatvapurn hota he
 The circuit below explains the role and circuit of the components of the basal ganglia
 sabathalemic nabhik, basal gangliya kaa ek diencefelic grey padaarth he, evam yah gangliya kaa ekmaatr hissaa he jo vastav main "uttejk" glutamic amla transmeter banaata he
 The role of the subthalamic nucleus is to stimulate the SNR-GPI complex and is also a part of the "indirect pathway"
 basal gangliya ke jatil paripath ko samajhane ke liye, hamen sarvapratham paripath ke mahatvapurn bhagidaaron ko jaananaa aavashyak he
 The basal ganglia are in direct contact with the thalamus and cortex
 isiilie, basal gangliya dwaara nirmit paripath main cortex, thilemus or basal gangliya, basal gangliya dwaara nirmit teen mukhya bhagidaar hote hai
 The human brain is responsible for the cortex, the highest state of power, and conscious perception of the world
 tantrika tantra dwaara pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se kiye gaye sabhi kaary cortex se sambandhit hai
 Many different areas of the cortex perform different functions
 pre-central gaeres cortex kaa aisa hi ek bhaag he jise "motor cortex" naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Specific neurons of the motor cortex region of the cortex extend their axons to the striatum portion of the basal ganglia
 ukt cortics ke neurons neurotransmeter glutamet chhodte hai, jo uttejk prakruti kaa hota he
 After being excited by glutamate, cells located in the striatum project in two different directions to form two major pathways - the "direct" and "indirect" circuits
 pratyaksh paripath main cortex dwaara ek baar uttejit hone par, striatum kii koshikaayen nirodhi neurons naamak neuro transmeter nirmit karti hai) esaenar -jipiai complex koshikaon, par prakshepit karti he
 snrs and gpis are intended to exert inhibitory effects on the thalamus while being continuously in contact with the thalamus, creating the GABA
 esaenar -jipiai ke nirodhatmak prabhaav ke chalate antim nishkarsh swarup thilemus par nirodhatmak prabhaav kaa lop hota he
 It is interesting to note that the thalamus itself projecting on the cortex continuously stimulates the cortex by glutamate
 isiilie, pratyaksh paripath ke chalate thilemus ko anumati praapt hoti he ki vah cortex ko uttejit kare
 uttejit hone ke baad cortex yah "uttejnaa" sandesh motor paripath ko parshv cortico spinal tract ke madhyam se mansapeshiyon tak pahunchaata he, jiske falswaroop ati gatij vyavhaar najar aata he
 The following diagram shows the "direct" route: cortex - -> striatum - -> "esaenar-jipiai" complex - -> thilemus - -> cortex - -> mansapeshiyon, aadi -> At the opposite end there is an indirect circuit that starts from the neurons of the striatum
 striatum main sthit neurons ke samooh cortex dwaara prerit hote hi ab nirodhi eksans globas palids eksterna ki koshikaon ko nirodhi sanket prasaarit karte hai
 gpes show persistent anticonvulsant effects to the subthalamic nucleus
 nirodhak dwaara nirodhi prabhaav ke chalate estn vastav main uttejit ho jate hai
 As a result, stns also spontaneously stimulate the complex SNR-GPI, where the main function of the SNR-GPI complex is to have an antagonistic effect on the thalamus
 iske falswaroop antat thilemus kaa vaastavik nirodh hokar thilemus dwaara cortex ko utejit karne kii kriya main kami hona, hota he
 As a result, the cortex contributes to the hypercritical position or loss of movement, by stimulating the muscles through the lateral cortico spinal tract
 sankshep main, pratyaksh or apratyaksh paripath kaary sampadan main paraspar virdohi hote hai
 Cortex - -> Striatum - -> GPE - -> STN - -> "SNR-GPI" Complex - -> Thalamus - -> Cortex - -> Muscle, etc
 -> kintu, yadi pratyaksh paripath gati kii sahaayta kare or apratyaksh paripath sahaayta na kare, to maanav sharir main janmajaat svaichhik gati ko lekar virodhabhas rahata he
 This paradox is diagnosed by the implementation of the substra nigra pars compacta that produce dopamine
 dopamine se basal gangliya main sthit vishisht di 1 receptors uttejit ho "pratyaksh" path ko madad karte hai, jabaki basal gangliya main sthit vishisht di 2 receptors par dopamine se nirodhi prabhaav utpann hota he evam vastav main "apratyaksh path" ko madad karata he
 In this way, the body creates a balanced position by keeping pace between motion and its absence
 is najuk tantra main santulan rahit sthiti ke chalate parkinsons vikaar jaisi vyaadhiyaan utpann ho jaati hai
 The naming of the basal ganglia and its components has always been problematic
 purv ke sharir rachana shastri sthool darshi sharir sanrachana ko dekhakar, kintu tantrika rasayan shaastra ke koshikeey nirmaan se anjaan hone ke naate, unhone aise avyavon ko sanchit kiya jo ab mana jane laga he ki bhinn- bhinn kaaryon ko anjaam dete hai, or is tarah unhone avyavon ko vibhinn naam die jo ab samajha jaataa he ki kaaryaatmak drushti se, usee sanrachana ke hisse hai 
 The term "basal" stems from the fact that most of its elements are located in the basal part of the forebrain
 gangliya shabd mithyaa naam he: aadhunik upyog main maatr paridhiy tantrika tantra ke neural / tantrika samoohon ko hi "gangliya" se sambodhit kiya jaataa jabaki kendriya tantrika tantra ke neural / tantrika samoohon ko "nabhik" kaha jaataa he
 For this reason, the basal ganglia are sometimes also known as the "basal nucleus"
 terminologia anatomica, jo ki sharir sanrachana namakaran ke liye antarrashtriya praadhikrut sanstha he, ne "nabhik beselis" naam sujhaayaa he jo ki saamanytah upyog main nahin liya jaataa
 The International Basal Ganglia Society informally believes that the basal ganglia are made up of the striatum, pallidum, substensia nigra and subthalamic nucleus
 percheron aadi ne 1991 main or parent and parent ne 2005 main thilemus ke madhya bhaag ko basal gangliya ke ek bhaag ke rup main sammilit kiya, jabaki mena-segovia aadi ne 2004 main pedunculopontine complex ko bhi sammilit kiya
 In addition, the names given to different nuclei of the basal ganglia vary
 vishesh rup se, aadi maanav ke globas palids ke andruni khand ko mushakon main antopeduncular nabhik kaha jaataa he
 Etc
 The outer segment of "striatum" and "globus pallidus" in humans are called "palaeostriatum augmentatum" and "palaeostriatum primitivum", respectively, in birds
 sharir rachana adhyayan, mukhyatah chuhon or vaanron ke shaareerik adhyayan, tathaa unhen kshati pahunchaane vaale vikaron ke adhyayan se, basal gangliya ke kaaryon kii jaankaree praapt hoti he
 The largest sources of detailed information about the basal ganglia are two neurological disorders, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease
 in donon vikaron ke liye, tantrika kii kshati ko acchhee tarah gyaat kar parinamswaroop dikhaai dene vaale lakshanon ke saath sahasambaddha kiya ja saktaa he
 In Parkinson's disease, there is a large loss of dopaminergic cells located in the ssubstantia nigra, a severe loss of medium prickly neurons located in the striatum in Huntington's disease
 donon rogon ke lakshan lagbhag vipareet hai- parkingsanse rog kii visheshta he ki usame gatividhi karne kii kshamta kaa hraas hota he, jabaki hantington rog kii visheshta he ki usame sharir ke bhaagon kii anaichhik rup se gatividhi ko rokane main asamarthta hoti he
 It is noteworthy that, although the symptoms of both diseases are particularly in their cognitively advanced stage, the most prominent symptoms are related to the onset of activity and their ability to control
 is prakaar, donon vikaar mukhya rup se gatividhi kii aswasthta main vargeekrut hai
 a different type of disease related to activity malaise, known as hemibellismus, is caused by damage to the subthalamic nucleus
 hemibelismus ke lakshan hai, haathon or pairon kii hinsaatmak evam aniyantrit rup se gatividhi
 One of the most studied works of basal ganglia is the role of basal ganglia in eye movements
 a wide network of brain regions affects the movement / movement of the eyes, which is centered in an area called the superior cauliculus of the middle brain
 essi ek starit sanrachana he jiske str drishy sthal ke do aiami nakshe banaate hai
 a "bump" of neural activity at depths of SC levels dictates movement of the eye at some point observed
 biji kii ore se essi ko ek majboot nirodhatmak prakshepan praapt hota he joki substenshia nigra pars reticulata se nikalataa hota he
 Neurons located in the SNR usually project at a high rate, but they "stop" as soon as the eye movements begin and leave the SC with an inhibitory effect
 esaenar main sabhi prakaar kii netra kii halchal "thamane" se judi he - kintu vyaktigat esaenar neurons kuch prakaar kii halchal / gatividhi se adhik majbootee ke saath jude ho sakate hai
 Neurons in some parts of the caudate nucleus also exhibit eye movement activity
 chunki bahut adhik codet koshika kam dar par prakshepit hoti he, yah kriya adhikansh rup main prakshepan ke dar main badhottaree ke rup main pradarshit hoti he
 Stimulation in the caudate nucleus initiates movement of the eye, demonstrating an antagonistic effect on SNR directly via gabaergic projections
 haalanki motor niyantran main basal gangliya kii bhoomika spasht he, kintu kai sanketon se gyaat hota he kii vah vyavhaar ke niyantran main prerana ke str tak moulik taur par sammilit he
 In Parkinson's disease, the performance of the stirring ability of the components is often not effective, but causative factors such as hunger, fail to initiate movement or fail to release at the appropriate time
 parkinsons rogiyon main gatiheenata ko kabhi-kabhi "ichha kaa lakva" se bhi varnit karte hai
 It has also been observed that the aforementioned patients exhibit a phenomenon called kinesia paradoxia, in which a normally motionless person exhibits a coordinated and energetic response to an emergency and then goes into a state of motion loss
 prerit karne main basal gangliya kaa haath-pairon sadrishy bhaag kii bhoomika - arthath, nabhik ekambence, ventral palidam or ventral tegmental aria vishesh rup se acchhee tarah se sthapit he
 Thousands of experimental studies have shown that dopaminergic projection from VTA to NA plays a central role in the brain's reward system
 uttejk electrode ke saath pratyaropit pashu batan dabaate hi sheeghra uttejit ho jaayenge yadi har baar batan dabaane kii kriya ke baad kam antaraal tak vidyut pravaah jari rakhaa jaye
 kai chijen aisi he jo logon ko pratifal sadrishy mahasoos hoti he, jiname vyasnee dawa, jaayakedaar bhojan or sex shaamil he, inase dekha gaya ki vitie dopamin tantra ke kriyanvayan main prakharata aa gayi
 Damage or damage to NA or VTA can lead to a state of deep indolence
 haalanki, yah saarvbhaumik rup se sweekaar nahin he, par kuch siddantkaaron ne "aahaar sambandhi" vyavhaaron evam "upbhog sambandhi" vyavhaaron main antar pratipaadit kiya he jiske anusaar aahaar sambandhi vyavhaar basal gangliya chaalit hai jabaki anya ke saath aisa nahin he
 For example, an animal severely afflicted with basal ganglia will not be attracted to food even if the food is placed a few inches away, but if the food is placed directly in the mouth, the animal will chew it and swallow it
 basal gangliya agramastishk ke buniyadi avyavon main se ek he or rishadhari prajatiyon main pahachaane ja sakate hai
 Rather, in lumprey, striatal, pallidal, and nigral can be identified based on anatomy and cell chemistry / histology
 basal gangliya ke tulanaatmak shaareerik rachana ek spasht rup se ubharta mudda, is tantra kaa vikaas filogeni ke madhyam se, sansruth or twachaa ke sambandh main dubaara praveshak fande ke sangyojan ke rup main, jiske chalate twachaa aavaran kaa vikaas or prasar nihit he
 However, there is controversy regarding the extent of convergent selective processing of basal ganglia versus isolated parallel processing within the reentrant loop
 bhale hi, basal gangliya kaa roopantaran standhari vikaas main twajeey pun: praveshi pranali ke rup main madhya mastisk ke lakshya se palidle ke pun: nirdesh ke madhyam se, jaise kii, superior koliculus, jo souropcid mastisk main paaya jaataa he, se mastikeey cortex ke ventral thilemus ke vishisht kshetron tak upsanch banaakar striatum main prakshepit hota he
 The rostral direction of the abrupt tract from the inner segment of the globus pallidus — through the path of Ansa lenticularis in the ventral thalamus — can be seen to streamline and target genesis changes of the basal ganglia
 mastisk main cortical tantron ke dubaara praveshi tantron kii utpatti udbhav ko siddhant ke rup main jerald adellman ne neural darvinavaad siddhant ke prati mul jaankaree ke udbhav ke ek aadhaar ke rup main pratipaadit kiya
 In most areas of the brain, major classes of neurons use glutamate as neurotransmitters and elicit stimulating effects on their targets
 kintu basal gangliya main bahutansh neurons neurotransmeter ke rup main jieb kaa upyog karte hai or apane lakshya par nirodhatmak prabhaav daalate hai
 Inputs from the cortex and thalamus to the striatum and STN are glutamatergic, but the striatum, pallidum, and substra nigra pars reticulata all use GABA
 anya neurotransmeter main mahatvapurn rup se maddhamkaari prabhaav hota he
 The most intensive studies have been in dopamine, which is used to project on the striatum from the substratum nigra pars compacta and resect the nucleus from the ventral tegmental area onto the acumbens
 acetilecoline bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he, jiskaa upyog striatum ke kai bahari input evam striatal interneurons samooh, donon, dwaara hota he
 Although cholinergic cells constitute only a small fraction of the total population, the striatum has the highest acetylcholine concentration found in the brain structure
 is sweekruti ko aatmsaat karne main bahut samay laga ki basal gangliya pranali kaa gathan ek pramukh mastishk tantra kaa gathan he
 The first to clearly identify sub-cortical structures was published in 1664 by Willis Thomas
 kai saalon tak, corpus striatum yah shabd, up cortikeey tattvon ke bade samoohon ke liye prayog main laayaa jaataa rahaa, baad main gyaat hua ki iname se kuch kaa kaaryaatmak drushti se rup se koi sambandh nahin he
 For many years, the putamen and the caudate nucleus were not connected to each other
 iske bajaay, putamin palidam se judaa tha jise nabhik lenticulaaris yaa nabhik lentiformis kii sangya di gayi thi
 a thorough rethinking was done by Cecil and Oskar Vogts and simplified the description of the basal ganglia by suggesting the term striatum to the nucleus accumbens structure group joining the caudate nucleus, putamen, and epigastric
 striatum kaa namakaran, striato-pelido-nigral eksans ke ghaney bandalon kii chamak se nirmit hone vaale dharidaar swaroop ke aadhaar par kiya gaya tha, jisko maanav rachanashasthri alexander kinnie wilson ne "pencil ke samaan" kaha he
 The structural link of the striatum with its original targets was discovered later than the pallidum and the substrains Nigra
 globas palids naam dijerine to burdak ne 1822 main diya tha
 For this, Vogt's proposed the simple name "pallidum"
 "locas nizer" shabd ko felics vik-di'azir dwaara take noir ke rup main pesh kiya gaya tha, haalanki uske baad se 1788 main won sommring ke yogadan ke kaaran vah sanrachana substenshia nigra naam se jaani jaati he

 isamen khanijon ke bhautik or rasinic gunon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 This branch of science also includes the formulation, composition, classification, mineralogy and location of minerals and their properties
 iske madhyam se hi khanijon ke prayog or upyog kaa bhi adhyayan isi main kiya jaataa he
 Like other branches of science, it originated several thousand years ago
 vartmaan khanij vigyaan kaa kshetra, kai duusari shakhaon jaise, jeev vigyaan or rasiniki tak vistrut ho gaya he
 The Greek philosopher Socrates first conceived the origin of minerals and their properties in principle, although Socrates and his contemporary thinkers later proved to be wrong but according to the time his theories were new and modern
 kintu ye kahana bhi atishyokti na hoga ki unki avadharanaon ke kaaran hi khanij vikaas kii jatiltaaon ko sulajhane main sahyog mila, jis kaaran aaj uske aadhunik rup se vigyaan samrudh he
 Mineralogy began to take a modern form after the 16th century due to the tireless efforts of German scientist Georgius Agricola
 khanij vigyaan ke bare main aarambhik lekhan, visheshkar ratna aadi ke bare main pracheen babylonia, pracheen yunaan-rome samrajyon, pracheen china or pracheen bharat ke sanskrit main uplabdh puranic sahitya main miltaa he
 Among the books available on this subject is Pliny the Elder's Naturalis Historia, which not only describes the various minerals, but also describes many of their properties
 german punarjagran visheshgy georgious agricola ne di re matelika or di nachura fosilium jaise kai granth diye hai, jinamein is vishay par vaigyanik pahaluon par vichaar kiya gaya he
 The post-renaissance era in Europe led to the development of systematic and systematic scientific studies of minerals and rocks

 The development of technologies in recent years and the fast computing capability available, supported by the study of crystal behavior by modern computers and highly accurate atomic-scale simulations; Science has separated the s branch for in-depth study in the fields of inorganic chemistry and solid state physics
 phir bhi isamen ab bhi pashaan-nirmaan main lage khanijon kii crystal sanrachana par dhyaan kendrit rakhaa he
 In the development of this branch, atomic-scale studies of minerals and their functions have been highlighted

 beesvin sadi ke aathven dashak main unhone yah siddhant pesh kiya ki har kaum yani nrijati ethnas jaise prakritik parivesh main jiti he, usee ke anusaar uskaa vikaas hota he
 Gumlyov first asked himself the question, what is the thing that we call nrajati? What is the internal structure of a group of humans that is considered to be an ethnic, what sources are they associated with the world around them that maintain their separate identity for centuries? For the last few centuries it has been believed that the processes of birth, development and degradation of every ethnicity are linked to the rules of development of society
 gumilyove ko yah manyata sweekaar nahin thi
 He believed that the human race living on a large territory is ethnically, that its birth and development are not linked to the origin of the new socio-economic structure

 On the contrary, soft X-rays are said to be able to penetrate a substance with great difficulty; For example, the attenuation length of an X-ray with 600 electro volts wavelength in water is less than 1 micrometer
 eks-re ek prakaar kaa insheel vikiran hai or inkaa anaavaran swasthya ke liye hanikaarak ho saktaa he
 The distinction between X-rays and gamma rays has changed in recent decades
 multah, eks-re naliyon se utsarjit hone vaale vidyut chumbakeey vikiran kaa tarangadairghy radiodharmee nabhik se utsarjit vikiran ke tarangadairghy se lanbaa tha
 The ancient literature established a distinction between x and gamma radiation based on wavelengths where radiation, defined as gamma rays, was smaller than a unilateral wavelength, such as 10–11 m

 Nowadays, generally, two types of radiation are distinguished by their origin: X-rays are emitted by electrons located outside the nucleus while gamma rays are emitted by the nucleus
 eks-re kii insheel kshamta kii maap ko anaavaran kaha jaataa he: However, the effect of ionizing radiation on matter is much more closely related to the amount of energy deposited in them than the charge produced
 is avashoshit urja kii maap ko avashoshit maatra kaha jaataa he: Equivalent volume is the measurement of the biological effects of radiation on human tissue
 jahaan tak eks-re kaa sawaal he, yah avashoshit maatra ke baraabar hota he
 Medical X-rays are an important source of man-made radiation exposure, with a magnitude of 58% in the United States in 1987, but since most radiation exposures are natural, the magnitude of medical X-rays is higher than the total US radiation exposure
 It is only 10 percent
 danta eks-re kii vajah se suchit maatra kaaphi bhinn dikhaai detii he
 Depending on the source, a specific dental X-ray of a human would probably result in an exposure of 3, 40, 300, or at most 900 emrames

 In crystallography, a copper target is most common, with cobalt often being used when fluorescence of the iron material in the sample may otherwise cause a problem
 utpann eks-re ke photon kii adhiktam urja ghatit electron kii urja dwaara simit hoti he, jo nalee ke voltage ke baraabar hota he, isliye 80 kevi vaali ek nalee 80 kilo electro volt adhik urja vaali eks-re kaa nirmaan nahin kar sakati he
 When electrons hit the target, X-rays are formed by two different atomic processes: isliye ek nalee ke parinami utpaada main nalee ke voltage par shunya tak girane vaala ek satat bramlestrolang varnakram or saath main abhilakshanik rekhaon par kai spike hote hai
 The voltage used in clinical X-ray tubes and thus the highest energy of X-rays is about 20 to 150 kv
 chikitsiya naidanik anuprayogon main, kam urja vaali eks-re avaanchit hoti hai kyonki sharir unhen puri tarah avashoshit kar letaa he, jisase maatra badhaane kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Therefore, a thin metallic sheet, often an aluminum sheet or sheet, called an X-ray filter, is usually placed on the window of the X-ray tube, which filters the low-energy components in the spectrum
 ise beam kaa sakhtikaran kehete hai
 Both of these processes of producing X-rays are very inefficient, their output capacity is only around one percent and, therefore, the electric power that can be entered as input, to produce a usable current of X-rays a high percentage of k is released as waste heat
 eks-re nalee kaa dizin aisa hona chahie ki yah is atirikt ooshmaa ko failaa sake
 Radiographs obtained using X-rays can be used to identify a broader spectrum of pathology

 To make an image of an X-ray of human or animal bones, short X-rays flutter illuminate the body or part and a radiographic film is placed behind it
 upasthit koi bhi asthiyaan prakaash vidyut prakriyaaon dwaara eks-re ke adhikansh photon ko avashoshit kar leti hai
 This is because bones have a higher electron density than soft tissues

 In more recent years, computerized and digital radiography is being used in place of photographic film in medical and dental applications, although film technology is still widely used in industrial radiography processes
 Photographic plates are mostly a matter of history, and the "intensifying screen" that replaces them is also becoming dull in history

 Initially, the most common detection methods were based on ionization of gases, such as in the Geiger – Müller counter: a sealed volume, typically a cylinder, with a gas, cylindrical cathode in a mica, polymer or thin metallic window, and a wire is anode; High voltage is passed between the cathode and the anode
 jab ek eks-re photon silinder main pravesh karti he, to yah gaiyr kaa ynikaran karti he or yanon va electronon kaa nirmaan karti he
 In this process, electrons move rapidly towards the anode, leading to further ionization along their trajectory

 There are considerable differences in the details of his discovery as Röntgen burned his lab notes at the time of his death, but this may have been the concoction of his biographers: Röntgen, a crux tube and a fluorescent screen painted with barium platinocyanide
 With cathode rays attached to it, which they wrapped in a black curboard so that the visible light emitted from the tube interfered Do not
 He saw a misty green glow emanating from the screen at about 1 meter distance
 He felt that some invisible rays from the tube were passing through the cardboard, which caused the curtain to glow
 unhone paaya ki ve unki mej par rakhi kitabon or kaagajon se hokar bhi guzar sakati thi
 Röntgen immediately began systematically investigating these unknown rays

 Under 'adigranth', apart from the first five gurus of Sikhs, there are the statements of their ninth Guru and 14 'bhagats'
 aisa koi sangrah sambhavat: guru nanakdev ke samay se hi taiyaar kiya jane laga tha or guru amardaas ke putr mohan ke yahan pratham chaar guruon ke patradi surakshit bhi rahe, jinhen paanchaven guru ne unase lekar pun: krambaddh kiya tathaa unamem apni ore kuch 'bhagaton' kii bhi baniyaan sammilit karke sabko bhai gurudas dwaara gurumukhi main lipibaddh kara diya

 uskaa yahi rup aaj bhi vartmaan samajha jaataa he
 It is difficult to say only about a few final compositions when and how they were added

 Sometimes Adibranth is also called 'gurubani', but in the eyes of its devotees, it is always a physical guru

 jab pehali baar nikaala jaataa he to kharchit eendhan chhadon ko pani ke parirakshit basinon main sangrahit kiya jaataa he, jo aamtaur par site par hote hai
 It provides both water, cooling and still shielding from the continuing radioactivity for the fission products still destroyed
 After a period, coolant, less radioactive fuel is now typically sent to a dry storage facility or dry cask storage, where the fuel is stored in steel and concrete containers

 yah tark diya gaya he ki parmaanu kachare ke liye sabase acha upaay he bhoomi ke upar asthaayee bhandaaran, kyonki takanic tezi se badal rahi he
 Some believe that existing waste may be a valuable resource in the future

 While the article continues, "today we keep garbage containers stored because currently scientists don't know how to reduce or eliminate toxicity, but maybe 100 years later scientists will know 


 nuclear waste There is a very difficult political problem which no country has solved till date
 ek arth main, yah parmaanu udyog kii kamazor kadi he
 

 Mandil says, "if France is unable to resolve this issue, then i do not understand how we can continue our nuclear program"
 In addition, there are also critics of reprocessing themselves, such as the Union of Concerned Scientists
 parmaanu udyog, dooshit vastuon ke rup main nimna-stareey radiodharmee kachare kaa bhi baari maatra main utpaadan karata he, jaise kapadaa, hast-upkaran, jal shuddhak regin or ve samagriyaan jinase riector khud bana he
 In the United States, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has repeatedly tried to allow low-level wastes to be treated as common wastes: stored in one place, recycled as consumer goods
 Most low-level wastes leave low levels of radioactivity and are considered radioactive wastes simply because of their history
 parmaanu urja vaale deshon main, kul audyogic vishakt kachare main radiodharmee kachare kaa yogadan 1% se bhi kam he, jisamen se adhikansh bhaag anishchit kaal tak ke liye khatarnaak bana rahata he
 Overall, the amount of waste generated by nuclear power is much lower than fossil-fuel based power plants
 koyala chaalit sanyantron ko vishakt or halki radiodharmee raakh utpann karne ke liye vishesh rup se janaa jaataa he jisaki vajah he swaabhaavik rup se hone vaale dhaatuon kaa sankendran or koyale se nikalne vaali mand radiodharmee vastu
 ok rij neshnal leboratory kii ek taaja report ne nishkarsh nikaala he ki koyala urja se vaataavaran main, parmaanu urja sankriya kii tulana main vastav main adhik radiodharmita pahunchati he or ki koyale ke sanyantr ke vikiran ke baraabar jansankhya prabhavi khuraaq, parmaanu sanyantr ke adarsh sanchaalan se 100 guna zyada he
 Coal ash, of course, is much less radioactive than nuclear waste, but the ash goes directly into the atmosphere, while nuclear plants use irradiated reactor vessels, fuel rods and shielding to protect the environment from any radioactive waste on site 
 punarsansaadhan se, kharchit parmaanu eendhan se plutonium or uranium ke sambhavit rup se 95% ko, ise mishrit oxide eendhan main daal kar punah praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 This reduces long-term radioactivity within the remaining waste, as it is largely a short-term fission product and reduces its volume by more than 90%
 urja riektaron se naagarik eendhan kaa punarsansaadhan, vartmaan main bade paimaane par britain, france or rus main kiya jaataa he or sheeghra hi china main or shaayad bharat main bhi kiya jayega or japan main yah ek brihat paimaane par kiya ja rahaa he
 The full reprocessing capacity has not been achieved because it requires a 0} breeder reactor, which is not yet commercially available
 
 france ko sabase safal punarsansaadhan karne vaale ke rup main janaa jaataa he, lekin vah vartmaan main prayog kiye jane vaale vaarshik eendhan kaa keval 28% ko punarsansaadhit karata he, france ke andar 7% ko or shesh 21% ko rus main
 Unlike other countries, the US halted civil reprocessing as a part of the US non-proliferation policy from 1976 to 1981, as reprocessed materials such as plutonium could be used in nuclear weapons: however, reprocessing in the US is now permitted is

 Uranium enrichment produces several tons of empty uranium, composed of U-238, from which the easily fissile U-235 isotope has been removed
 U-238 ek kathor dhaatu he jiske kai vanijyik upyog hai - udhaaharan ke liye, vimaan utpaadan, vikiran parirakshan or kavach - kyonki lead kii tulana main iskaa ghanatv ucch he
 Empty uranium is also useful in weapons such as the DU Penitrator's "self Sharpen", due to the tendency of uranium to fracture with shear bands
 kuch aisi bhi chintaaen hai ki U-238, un samoohon ke liye swasthya khatra utpann kar saktaa he jo is saamagree ke sampark main jarurat se zyada rahete hai, jaise tanks ke karmchaaree dal or ve naagarik jo aise kshetron main rahete hai jahaan DU gola barood kii ek badi maatra kaa prayog parirakshan, bam, missile, sphotak sheersh or goliyon main kiya gaya ho
 In January 2003, the World Health Organization released a report finding that contamination from DU munitions was up to a few tens of meters from the impact site in the local area and contamination of local vegetation and water was 'extremely low'
 report main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki kha lee gai lagbhag 70% DU choubees ghante baad sharir se nikal jaaegi or kuch dinon ke baad 90%
 The economics of nuclear power plants are mainly influenced by the huge initial investment required to build a plant
 2009 main, america main ek nae sanyantr kii laagat anumaanit rup se $6 se $10 bilian ke bich hoti he
 Therefore it is generally more economical to run them as long as possible or to build additional reactor blocks in existing facilities
 In 2008, the costs of building a new nuclear power plant were rising faster than the costs of other types of power plants
 
 2003 MIT ke liye is udyog kaa adhyayan karne ke liye gathit ek pratishthit panel ne nimnlikhit paaya: The MIT study used a 40-year baseline for the life of a nuclear reactor

 The nuclear power debate is about the controversy that surrounds the deployment and use of nuclear fission reactors for civilian purposes to generate electricity from nuclear fuel
 parmaanu urja se sambandhit vivaad 1970 or 1980 ke dashak ke dauraan charam par tha, jab yah kuch deshon main, "itnaa bheeshan ho gaya jo praudyogiki itihaas main abhootpurv tha"
 Proponents of nuclear power argue that nuclear power is a sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions and enhances energy security while reducing dependence on foreign oil
 samarthakon kaa daawa he ki parmaanu urja, jeevashm eendhan ke pramukh vyavhaarya vikalp ke vipareet, vastav main koi paaramparik vaayu pradooshan nahin failaati he, jaise green house gas or kala dhuna
 samarthakon kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki parmaanu urja hi adhikansh pashchimi deshon ke liye urja main nirbharta praapt karne kaa ekmaatr vyavhaarya rasta he
 Proponents claim that the risk of waste storage is small and can be further reduced by the use of the latest technology in new reactors and, compared to other types of major power plants in the Western world, operational safety history has been excellent
 virodhiyon kaa maananaa he ki parmaanu urja logon or paryaavaran ke liye khatra utpann karti he
 
 These threats include the processing, transport and storage problems of radioactive nuclear waste, nuclear weapons proliferation and terrorism, as well as the health hazards and environmental harm from uranium mining
 He also argues that reactors themselves are highly complex machines where many things can go wrong or do and many serious nuclear accidents have occurred
 aalochak is baat par vishwaas nahin karte hai ki urja ke strot ke rup main parmaanu vikhandan ke upyog ke jokhim ko nai praudyogiki ke vikaas ke madhyam samyojit kiya ja saktaa he
 He also argues that when all energy-intensive phases of the nuclear fuel chain are taken care of, from uranium mining to nuclear discharge, nuclear power is not a low-carbon power source

 Lord Gautam Buddha, who was doing penance under the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, had attained enlightenment
 tabhi se yah sthal buddha dharm ke anuyaayiyon ke liye atyant mahatvapurn he
 In 2002, the city was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO
 kareeb 500 ipu
 main gautam buddha phalgu nadi ke tat par pahunche or bodhi ped ke neeche tapasya karne baithe
 After three days and nights of penance, he attained enlightenment, after which he became known as Buddha
 iske baad unhone vahaan 7 hafte alag alag jagahon par dhyaan karte hue bitaayaa or phir sarnath ja kar dharm kaa prachaar shuru kiya
 The followers of the Buddha later started visiting the place where Buddha had attained enlightenment on the full moon day in the month of Vaishakh
 dhire dhire ye jagah bodhgaya ke naam se janaa gaya or ye din buddha purnima ke naam se janaa gaya
 Around 528 BC In the month of Vaishakh, Gautama, the prince of Kapilavastu, abandoned the house in search of truth
 gautam gyaan kii khoj main niranjana nadi ke tat par based ek chote se gaanv uruvela aa gaye
 He started meditating under a peepal tree in this village
 ek din vah dhyaan main leen the ki gaanv kii hi ek ladki sujatha unke liye ek katoraa kheer tathaa shahad lekar ai
 After doing this food, Gautam again got absorbed in meditation
 iske kuch dinon baad hi unke agyaan kaa badal chat gaya or unhen gyaan kii praapt hui
 Now he was not Prince Siddhartha or Tapasvi Gautama, but Buddha
