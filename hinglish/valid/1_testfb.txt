 In England, the distinction is now confined to pronunciation rather than grammar or dictionary

 a number of English based Pidgin and Creole languages have been formed, such as Jamaican Patois, Nigerian Pidgin and Tok Pisin
 Many words have been composed in the English language to describe the types of non-english languages that are full of English words
 yahan * kaa arth un swaron par nishaan lagaana he jo hindi ke dhwani-tantra main nahin hote, yaa jinka shuddh uccharan adhikansh bhartiya nahin kar pate
 English is an intonation language
 iskaa arth yah he kii vaani ke utaar chadhaav ko paristhiti ke anusaar istemaal kiya jaataa he
 For example, expressing surprise or sarcasm, or turning a statement into a question
 angreji main, intonaton pattern shabdon ke samooh par hote hai jinhen tone samooh, tone ikai, intonaton samooh yaa indriya samoohon ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Tone groups are called in a single breath, hence their length is limited
 ye ausatan paanch shabd lambe hote hai or lagbhag do second main khatam ho jate hai
 for example : angreji ek bahut jor de kar bolne vaali bhashaa he
 Some syllables of both words and sentences get more importance / emphasis at the time of pronunciation while others do not
 The first type of syllables are called accentuated / stressed and the latter ones are unenxcited / unstressed
 is prakaar ek vaakya main prayek tone samooh ko shabdaanshon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he jo kii yaa to stressd honge yaa anstroped 
 stressd shabdaansh newclear shabdaansh kaha jaataa he
 for example: vaas da best thing you kud hev dan !' All syllables here are unstressed, except the best and the dun, which are stressed
 best par jor thodaa adhik diya gaya he isliye yah newclear shabdaansh he
 The nuclear syllable describes the main point of the speaker
 udhaaharan ke liye: This also yah bhaavana vyakt karne ke liye bhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he: Nuclear syllables are spoken in a much louder tone, and there is a distinct change in the tone of speech
 is lahaze ke sabase saamaanya badlaav hai aawaaj ko unchaa karnaa or aawaaj ko nichaa karnaa, haalaanki girti-chadhati aawaaj or chadhati-girti aawaaj kaa bhi yada kada istemaal hota he
 The importance of raising and lowering the voice in English language is much more than other languages
 nichi aawaaj main bolnaa nischitata darshata he or unchi aawaaj main bolnaa anischitata
 iskaa arth par ek mahatvapurn prabhaav pad saktaa he, khaskar sakaaratmak athwa nakaaratmak drushtikon ko darshane main; nichi aawaaj main bolne kaa matlab he aapkaa "drushtikon gyaat" he or chadhati hui aawaaj kaa matlab "drushtikon agyaat" he
 The same is behind the rising voice of yes / no questions
 udhaaharan ke liye: The vowels vary in each region
 jahaan pratik jode main drishy hai, pehla america angreji ke saamaanya america uccharan se mail khaataa he, doosraa british angreji ke praapt uccharan se mail khaataa he
 It is the English consonant system using symbols from the international phonetic alphabet

 Case marking has almost disappeared from the language and today it is mainly used in pronouns
 germanik mul se praapt majboot banaam kamjor kriya ke swaroop kaa aadhunik angreji main mahatva ghat gaya he or ghumaav ke avasheshon kaa upyog bad gaya he
 Presently, the language has become more analytical and tools such as technological verbs and word order have been developed to explain the meaning
 sahaayak kriyaayen prashnon, nakaaratmakataa, pasive vois or pragatisheel pahaluon ko darshaati hai
 Since English is a Germanic language, most of its daily usage vocabulary comes from ancient German
 iske atirikt bhi angrezi main kai rinshabd hai
 According to a survey, the situation is: angreji shabdaawalee sadiyaan bitne ke saath kaaphi badal gayi he
 Like many languages from proto-indo-european, the origin of the most common English words can be traced to the PIE
 in shabdon main shaamil hai buniyadi sarvnaam ' jaise ai, puraani angreji ke shabd isi se,, me, sankhyayen ", duo, tris), saamaanya paariwarik sambandh jaise kii mata, pita, bhai, bahan aadi, kai jaanwaron ke naam or kai aam kriyaayen 
 Germanic words are shorter than Latin words in English and they are more common in common colloquial usage
 isamen lagbhag sabhi buniyadi sarvnaam, purvasarg, sanyojak, dyotak kriyaayen aadi shaamil hai jo kii angreji ke buniyadi vaakyavinyas or vyakaran ko banaati hai
 Longer Latin words are often considered more ornate and educated

 George Orwell's essay "politics and English" criticizes this and other alleged misuse of language
 is niabandh ko angreji bhashaa kii ek mahatvapurn samiksha mana jaataa he
 An English speaker is allowed to choose from Latin and Germanic synonyms: less or arrives; Site or vision; Freedom or Liberty
 In some cases, there is an option to choose from a Germanic derived word, a Latin derived word and a French word derived from the same Latin word
 vividh arthon or baarikiyon ko samete ye paryaayavachi shabd vaktaaon ko baariq bhed or vichaaron kii bhinnata ko vyakt karne main sahaayak hote hai
 Knowledge of the history of synonyms can give English speakers greater control over their language
 dekhen: angreji main jarmenic or latin samakakshon kii soochi
 There is an exception and a feature that is probably only found in the English language
 vah yah he kii, gosht kii sangya aamtaur par use pradaan karne vaale jaanavar kii sangya se bhinn or asambandhit hoti he
 The animal usually has a Germanic name and the meat is derived from the French
 udahaaran, hiran or venisan ; gaay or bif ; boar / pig or pork, tathaa bhed or matan 
 ise norman akraman kaa parinaam mana jaataa he, jahaan anglo-sexn nimna varg dwaara pradaan kiye gaye gosht ko french bolne vaale abhijaat varg ke log khate the
 During a debate, the speaker prefers to use these words to express his or her speech directly, because most of the words used in informal environments are usually Germanic
 adhikansh latin shabdon kaa prayog aamtaur par aupchaarik bhaashan athwa lekhan main hota he, jaise kii ek adaalat athwa ek vishwakosh lekh
 haalaanki anya latin shabd bhi hai jinka upyog aamtaur par saamaanya bolchaal main kiya jaataa he or ve zyada aupchaarik bhi prathit nahin hote hai; ye shabd mukhyata avadharanaon ke liye hai jinka koi jarmenic shabd ab nahin bachaa he
 Their synergy is better in context and in many cases they do not even appear to be Latin
 udahaaran, ye sabhi shabd latin hai: pahaad, tarai, nadi, chachee, chachaa, chalanaa, upyog dhakka or rahanaa 
 English readily accepts technical words and often imports new words and sentences
 iske udahaaran hai, samakaleen shabd jaise kii kuki, internet or URL ,jiner, uber, lingua franca or emigo 
 iske alaava, theth shabd aksar puraane shabdon or vaakyanshon ko nayaa arth pradaan karte hai
 In fact, this fluidity is so obvious that there is often a need to distinguish between the contemporary usage of English and its formal types

 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200 ~ 350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150 
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 In a language form, two literary styles of 'hindi-urdu' developed
 ek style 'aadhunik hindi sahitya' kehalaati he jisamen bhartiya pratikon, upmaanon, bimbon, chhandon tathaa sanskrit kii tatsam evam bharat ke jansamaj main prachlit shabdon kaa prayog hota he tathaa jo devanagari lipi main likhi jaati he
 The 'urdu' style writers made more use of symbols, epithets, images, verses prevalent in Arabic and Persian literature
 jab arabi-farsi adab kii parampara ke anuroop yaa usase prabhavit hokar sahitya likhaa jaataa he to rachana main arabi sahitya tathaa farsi-sahitya main prayukt hone vaale shabdon kaa bahul prayog to hota hi he, uske saath-saath shailigat upaadaanon tathaa lay or chand main bhi antar ho jaataa he jisase rachana kii zamin or aasmaan badale-badale nazar aane lagate hai
 If the plot is based on Ramayana or Mahabharata, then 'composition-environment' is of a type, if the plot is based on the stories of 'laila-majnu', 'yusuf-zulekha', 'sheeri-farhad' then 'composition- The atmosphere is of another type
 upama 'camel' se yaa chaand se di jaati he to ped kii ek shakha par jis rang or khushboo vaale phool khilte hai, usase bhinn rang or khushboo vaale phool ped kii duusari shakha par tab khilne lagate hai jab upmaan 'abe jamajam', 'kohenur', 'shamaa', 'bulbul' aadi ho jate he
 In spoken language, all those who speak 'hindi-urdu' use the words bread, water, cloth, house, air, milk, curd, day, night, hands, feet, waist, thirst, love, sleep, dream etc
 equally
 Do, but when one genre litterateur 'chandra Udta Hua' for 'chand Uga' and another style writer 'mahtab Uruz Ho Gaya start writing, the same language stream starts flowing in two different flows
 jab sahitya kii bhinn paramparaon se prabhavit evam prerit hokar likhaa jaataa he to pani kii un dhaaraon main alag-alag shaileyon ke bhinn rang milakar un dhaaraon ko alag-alag rangon kaa pani bana dete hai

 Draupadi is one of the most famous characters of Mahabharata
 is mahakavy ke anusaar draupadi paanchal desh ke raja drupad kii putree he jo baad main paanchon pandavon kii patni bani

 atah yah ‘yagyaseni’ bhi kahalaai
 Draupadi was the daughter of a sage in a previous birth
 usne pati paane kii kaamana se tapasya kii
 Shankar was pleased and wished to give him the bride
 usne shankar se paanch baar kaha ki vah sarvagunsampann pati chaahati he
 Shankar said that she would have five Bharatvanshi husbands in the next birth, as she had repeated the desire to have a husband five times
 jab pandav tathaa kaurav rajkumaron kii shiksha purna ho gai to unhone dronacharya ko guru dakshina deni chaahi
 Dronacharya remembered his insult done by Drupada and he said to the princes, "princes! If you want to give Gurudakshina, then make the Panchal king Drupada a prisoner and present it to me
 yahi tum logon kii gurudakshina hogi
 "on Gurudev's saying like this, all the princes took their weapons and went towards the Panchal country
 paanchal pahunchne par arjuna ne dronacharya se kaha, "gurudev! aap pehle kauravon ko raja drupad se yuddh karne kii ajna dijiye
 If they fail to arrest Drupada, we will fight Pandava
 " guru kii ajna milane par duryodhana ke netritv main kauravon ne paanchal par akraman kar diya
 There was a fierce war between the two sides, but in the end the Kauravas escaped and fled
 kauravon ko palaayan karte dekh pandavon ne akraman armbh kar diya
 In the face of Bhimsen and Arjuna's might, the Panchal king's army was defeated
 arjuna ne aage bad kar drupad ko bandi bana liya or guru dronacharya ke samaksh le aaye
 Seeing Drupada as a prisoner, Dronacharya said, "O Drupada! Now i have become the lord of your kingdom
 main to tumhen apana mitra samaj kar tumhaare paas aayaa tha kintu tumne mujhe apana mitra sweekaar nahin kiya tha
 Now tell me, do you accept my friendship? "drupada bowed his head with shame and apologized for his mistake and said," o Drona! It was a mistake for me not to treat you as a friend and for that i now have remorse in my heart
 main tathaa meraa rajya donon hi ab aapke aadhin hai, ab aapaki jo ichha ho karen
 "dronacharya said," You said that friendship happens among people of the same class
 atah main tumse barabari kaa mitra bhav rakhane ke liye tumhen tumhaara aadha rajya lautaa rahaa hoon
 "having said this, Dronacharya handed over the state of the southern bank of the Ganges to Drupada and kept the rest himself
 guru dron se parajeet hone ke uparant maharaj drupad atyant lajjit huye or unhen kisi prakaar se nicha dikhaane kaa upaay sochane lage
 In this concern, once he wandered and reached the colony of Brahmins of Kalyani city
 vahaan unki bhent yaaj tathaa upyaaj naamak mahaan karmkandi brahman bhaaiyon se hui
 King Drupada pleased him by serving him and asked him the solution to kill Dronacharya
 unke poochne par bade bhai yaaj ne kaha, "iske liye aap ek vishaal yajna kaa aayojan karke agnidev ko prasann kijiye jisase ki ve aapako ve mahaan balashaali putr kaa vardaan de denge
 "maharaj performed the yajna and the yajya as per his instructions
 unke yajna se prasann ho kar agnidev ne unhen ek aisa putr diya jo sampoorn aayudh evam kavach kundal se yukt tha
 After that a girl was born from that sacrificial fire, whose eyes were bright like a lotus in bloom, eyebrows were like the moon and her character was bright
 uske utpann hote hi ek akashwani hui ki is balika kaa janm kshatriyon ke sanhaar or kauravon ke vinaash ke hetu hua he
 The child was named Dhritashyumna and the girl was named Krishna
 "main maharaj drupad kii nagari paanchal se aa rahaa hoon
 There, the king-maharaja of many countries have come for the Swayamvara of Draupadi, the daughter of Drupada
 " Ved Vyas - You go to Panchal
 vahaan drupad kanya panchali kaa swayamvar hone ja rahaa he
 That girl is absolutely worthy of you people, Shiva gave her the boon of having five good husbands in her next life
 vah deviswaroopa balika sab bhanti se tum logon ke yogya hi he

 Addressing the gathering, Dhrishtadyum said, "my sister Draupadi will be married to kings and emperors from various countries and other dignitaries
 " One after the other, all the kings and princes tried to hit the eye of a moving fish by looking at its image in the water below, but success did not hit them and they returned to their place without any trouble
 in asafal logon main jaraasandh, shalya, shishupal tathaa duryodhana, duhshasan aadi kaurav bhi sammilit the
 When the Kauravas failed, as soon as Karna raised the bow to aim, Draupadi refused to marry Karna at the behest of Shri Krishna, calling him a son
 tab shri krishna ke aadesh par ek brahman ko rajkumaari ne praapt karnaa chaha
 Arjun, looking at the image in the oil tank, shot with the same arrow
 draupadi ne aage bad kar arjuna ke gale main varmala daal diya
 All the Kshatriya kings-maharajas and princes got angry and attacked Arjuna after seeing Draupadi putting a garland on the neck of a Brahmin
 pandavon tathaa kshatriya raajaaon main ghamaasan yuddh hone laga
 The Pandavas took Draupadi along and reached there where they were staying with their mother Kunti
 dwaar se hi arjuna ne pukaar kar apni mata se kaha, "maate! aaj ham log aapke liye ek adbhut bhiksha le kar aaye hai
 "kunti said from within," Sons! You people consume it together
 " baad main yah gyaat hone par ki bhiksha vadhoo ke rup main hai, kunti ko atyant pashchaatap hua kintu mata ke vachanon ko satya siddh karne ke liye draupadi ne paanchon pandavon ko pati ke rup main sweekaar kar liya
 After some time after the Pandavas took Draupadi to their residence, Krishna followed them there
 aupchaariktaayen purna hone ke pashchaat kunti ne draupadi se kaha, "draupadi!pehle devataaon ke ansh nikaalo
 Then give it to the Brahmins
 tatpashchaat ashriton kaa ansh alag karo
 After that, serve half of the remaining part to Bhima and the remaining half to all of us
 "pativrata draupadi ne kunti ke aadesh kaa paalan kiya
 After eating, he slept after laying antelope on misrule

 Wow ! Life Ho To Aisi is a Hindi language film made in 2005
 sanskrit sahitya main kavyashastra ke liye alankarishastra, kaavyalankar, sahityavidya, kriyakalp aadi shabdon ke prayog milte hai
 Among these, the word ornamentation is considered to be the most prevalent
 bhamah, vaaman tathaa udbhat aadi pracheen aacharyon ne kavyavivechan se sambaddh granthon ke naam main kaavyalankar shabd kaa prayog kiya he
 There can be two reasons for calling it ornamentation
 ek to pracheen aacharyon ne samast soundaryajanak dharmon kaa alankaar shabd se grahan kiya he
 Other ancient masters believed that ornamentation is the dominant form of poetry
 isi kaaran kavyavivechna kaa naam alankarishastra rakh diya gaya
 Acharya Bhamah’s ‘shabarthaau Saathou Kavyaam’ This poetry inspired Acharyas to inspire the word literature in the postwar period
 in sab naamon se bhinn is shaastra ke liye ek naam or prayukt hua he vah he - ‘kriyakalp’ iskaa nirdesh vatsyayan ke kaamshaastra main ginayi gayi chausath kalaon main aata he
 Its commentator Jayamangalarka has coined the term Kriyakalpa in the sense "kavyakaranavidhi: Kavyalankar Ityartha"
 isse prathit hota he ki kalaon ke antargat prayukt hua kriyakalp shabd kavyashastra ke arth main prayukt hua he kintu yah naam atyadhik prachlit nahin hua
 Acharya Vatsyayana mentioned the activity in the Vidyasamudesh case presented in the Ordinary Tribunal
 kriyakalp arthath kaavyalankarishastra ke gyaan kii kala
 In relation to the enforcement of the scriptural idea of poetry, the poetical monarch Rajasekhar has taken the mythological basis in his poetic adult book, Kaviyamamsa
 is varnan ke anusaar bhagwaan shrikanth ne kavyavidya kaa sarvapratham upadesh parameshthi or vaikuntha ityadi apane chausath shishyon ko diya
 For the second time, this knowledge was preached by Lord Parmeshti to his willful disciples, among whom Kavipurusha, son of Devavandha Saraswati, was also one
 kavypurush ko trikalgya or divyadrushti se sampann jaanakar brahm ne use ajna di ki vah sarvajanhit kii kaamana se bhu-bhuvah or swarg nivasani praja main kavyavidya kaa prachaar kare
 Kavipurusha divided poetry into eighteen parts and assigned divine masters etc
 un shishyon ne kavyavidya ko pruthak-pruthak bhaagon main vishesh yogyata praapt kar pruthak pruthak granthon kii rachana kii
 Among these graduates, the millennium has Kavirhasya, the uttigarbha, the right, the Suvarnabha, the ritual, Pracheta has the epigraphic, Yama has the Yamak, the Chitrangad has the picture, the rest has the interpretation, the Pulatasya is the real, the Aupakya has the formal, the Parashar has the extreme, the Uthashya has the meaning, the Kubera has emerged , Kamadeva wrote Vainodik, Bharata metaphorical judgment, Upamanyu wrote virtuous product and Kuchumar wrote separate separate texts called Aupanishadik
 is prakaar rajasekhar ne kavyashastra ke udgam ke upar prakaash daalane kaa praytn kiya
 In this narrative, the divine origins of poetry have been accepted
 kavyamimasaa main varnit kavyashastra kii utpatti kaa aakhyaan puranic kaavyatmak kalpanaaon kii sristi he
 According to ancient Indian tradition, Vedas are the origin of all learning
 isi drushti se kavyashastra ke mul siddhanton kaa veda main anveshan karne kaa praytn kiya gaya he
 Vyakta poetry has no relation with Vedas
 vedaagen main bhi shiksha, kalp, vyakaran, nirukt, chand, jyotish in chah vidyaon kii gananaa he par kavyashastra kii nahin parantu veda ko dev kaa amar kavy kaha gaya he
 Devasya Pasya Kavyaam neither Mamar nor Jeerati
 vedon main anek sthanon par kavi shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 Therefore, the Veda itself is poetic in form and there is complete beauty of poetry in it
 rugveda ke saptam mandal main ‘arankrutih’ shabd kaa prayog miltaa he
 Maharishi Vasistha says to Indra - kavyashastra main kavyasoundarya ke aadhayak jin gun, reeti, alankaar, dhwani aadi tattvon kaa vivechan kiya gaya he ve sabhi tatva kaa praayogic athwa vyaavhaarik rup se veda main paye jate he
 Dr
 Kane is of the opinion that the Rigvedic poets not only used metaphors, exaggerations, metaphors etc
 but they also had some knowledge of the principles of poetry
 prastut mantra main mantradrushtaa rishi dwaara kiya gaya upama kaa prayog bhi prashansaneey he- Similarly, 'usha Hasnave Nirnite Apas' has a beautiful use of catalysis
 isi prakaar yah mantra bhi sundar udhaaharan he yatha- The mantra presented describes two birds living on peepal, one is eating sweet fruits of peepal and the other is happy without eating the fruit
 in pakshiyon ke madhyam se jeevatma tathaa paramatma kaa chithran kiya gaya he
 The living person experiences sensual pleasures and God does not enjoy fruits, and illuminates his beauty around the world
 yahan vibhaavna kaa sundar udhaaharan he
 In addition, the use of metaphor, alliteration, adjective is obvious
 anya samhitaon, brahmangranthon, aaranyakon tathaa upanishdon main bhi kavyashastra kaa swatantra astitv nahin praapt hota he
 In the later period, six Vedangas developed, in which a more nuanced rendering of poetry related subjects is seen
 nirukt main yask ne upama ke paanch bhedon-bhutopama, siddhopama, karmopama, luptopama kaa ullekh kiya he
 Also cited the subhuman character of his predecessor Acharya Garg
 acharya yask ne ‘athapyupamarthe bhavith’ kii vyakhya karte hue ive, yatha, na, chit, nu tathaa aa ke prayogon kii sarthakata siddh kii he
 In Nirukta, the use of the word 'alankara' in a dialectical sense is not found, but Yasak has used the word "alnarishnu" in the general sense of the nature of ornamentation
 panini ke yug tak upama kaa prayog spasht rup se uplabdh hota he
 As such, the use of va, iva has been explained in the formulas such as tatra tasyaev, ten as kriya cheddhati etc

 It is clear from the above facts that poetry is related in Vedag Nirukta and grammar

 There is ample evidence that a good type of poetry was composed centuries before AD
 ramayana or mahabharat in donon mahakavyon main uttam prakaar kii kavyrachana milti he
 Mahabharata is more theology than poetry, yet it has been the prognosis of many poets
 ramayana apane uddeshy, swaroop, vishay kii drushti se vastav main kavy he
 As far as the development of general principles of poetry composition and poetry review is concerned, Valmiki Ramayana is important from this point of view
 ise aadi kavy or iske rachayita ko aadi kavi hone kaa sammaan praapt he
 With such great poetic effort of sublime style, it is natural to attempt to formulate the principles of poetic interpretation
 ramayana main is disha kaa kuch sanket uplabdh hai
 As the Ramayana and the Mahabharata had a rich form of poetry, the path of establishing poetic principles would have been paved with great clarity
 yadhyapi is samay sanskrit kavyashastra kii swatantra rachana nahin huyi phir bhi kuch sakshya uplabdh hote hai jinke aadhaar par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki is kaal main bhi paryaapt kavyrachana huyi thi
 The epic form was modeled on the basis of 'valmiki Ramayana'
 rudrat ke tikaakar namisadhu ne panini ke naam se ‘patalvijay’ naamak mahakavy kaa ullekh kiya he- tathaahi panineh patalvijaaye mahakavye-‘‘sandhyaavadhoongrihyakaren’’
 While Rajasekhar quotes Jambavatijay poetry by the same name
 suvrittatilak main kshemendra ne upjati main panini ke vaishishty prapti kii charchaa kii he
 It is clear from the use of the word ahāyaka in Katyayana's conversation that Kāvyang, which is known as Akhāyaka, had become prevalent before Katyayana

 Along with this, there are also references to Vasavadatta, Sumanottara and Bhamarathi
 patanjali ne kansavadh tathaa balibndhan kii kathaon par do kritiyon tathaa uske naatakeey pradarshan kii charchaa kii he
 These facts suggest that a sufficient number of poems and plays were produced before Patanjali
 bharat kaa naatyashaastra vartmaan kaal main kavyashastra kaa pracheenatam granth uplabdh he
 But such evidence is available on the basis of which it can be said that Natyashastra is not the original book of Indian poetry
