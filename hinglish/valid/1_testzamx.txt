 shyaam sundar das jivan ke antim kshan tak sahitya-seva main sakriy rahe
 Just before and after independence, the entire generation of Hindi grew only by sitting on Babuji's shoulders
 samay-samay par vibhinn vishyon par sammelnon main diye jane vaale unke vaktavyon kii sankhya anginat he
 Looking at all this thinking, it becomes clear how they wanted to pursue Hindi literature by connecting it with many subjects
 aaj bhi babuji kii bahut badi dein he paathya-saamagree kii pramanik rachana tathaa adhyayan ke kshetra kaa vivek
 His every minute effort to bring fresh material to the students resulted in his becoming a collector
 aalochana kii jaati he ki isi kaaran unke lekhan main gahraayi or moulikta kaa abhaav hota gaya
 But it remains to be seen that his syncretic intelligence was engrossed in the material collection of many knowledge fields
 yahan tak ki vyaavhaarik-aalochana main bhi babuji ne saamanjasywad kaa saundarya sthapit kiya
 That is why comparison, historical view, interpretation, commentary etc
 entered his criticism
 is tarah hindi main vyaavhaarik-aalochana kaa aarmabhik maarg bhi unhone taiyaar kiya
 His efficient leadership later proved to be a boon for the Hindi-speaking region
 babu shyaam sundar das ne vichaaratmak tathaa bhavatmak donon hi ek prakaar ke niabandh likhe hai
 There is enough variety in the subject of his essays
 unhone bahut se achoote vishyon par bhi lekhnee chalaai kaviyon kii khoj tathaa itihaas sambandhi nibandhon main unki pratibha ke darshan hote hai
 The language of Babu Shyam Sundar Das is pure literary Hindi, in which the corresponding words of Sanskrit are predominant
 bhashaa ke sambandh main unka vichaar tha- 'jab ham videshi bhaavon ke saath videshi shabdon ko grahan karen tab unhen aisa bana len ki unamem se videshipan nikal jaae or ve apane hokar hamaare vyakaran ke niyamon se anushaasit hon
 'therefore, wherever they have used the prevalent words of' Urdu 'in their language, they have removed their character, they have used them by removing the dots under the words pen, drill, law etc
 and changing their pronunciation
 isi prakaar sanskrit ke shabdon kii clishtataa dur kar ke unhen hindi main saral dhang se likhaa he- jaise- kaary ke sthaan par kaary, anjan ke sthaan par anjan
 Babu Shyamsunder Das was of the opinion about the word selection- 'the first place is the words of pure Hindi, behind it the easy and popular words of Sanskrit, behind it the simple and popular words of foreign languages like Persian and behind it the obsolete of Sanskrit
 Let the words be spaced
 farsi aadi videshi bhashaaon ke kathin shabdon kaa prayog kadaapi na ho
 Babu Shyam Sundar Das has written mainly in two types of styles - 1
 vichaaratmak style- vichaaratmak style main vichaaratmak niabandh likhe gaye hai
 The sentences in this style are short and expressive
 bhashaa sabal, saral or pravahamayi he
 For example- 'gopiyo kaa sneh badhaya he
 They are compiled with Krishna in Ras Leela
 anek utsav manaati he
 This behavior of Premmayi gopikas is very delightful
 usamen kahin se aswabhaaviktaa nahin aa saki
 2
 Exploratory Style - The explanatory style is used in exploratory essays
 inamen vaakya apekshaakrit kuch lambey hai
 There is a plethora of corresponding words in the language
 vishay kii gahanta tathaa shushkta ke kaaran yah style main kuch shushk or rahit he
 See an example of this type of style- 'yah jivan-sangram do bhinn sabhyataaon ke sangharshan se or bhi teevr or dukhamay prathit hone laga he
 According to this condition, when literature is generated and encouraging the brain of the society, then only the signs of real progress will be seen and its welfare will give the country the glory of modern times
 babu shyaam sundardaas kii kisi prakaar kii style main alankaaron kii sajaavat nahin pai jaati
 Sayings and idioms have been used sparingly
 apane vichaaron ko bhalee prakaar samajhane ke liye babu shyaam sundar das ne ek hi baat ko 'saransh yah he' 'athwa', 'jaise' aadi shabdon ke saath baar-baar duharaaya he
 In Hindi literature, Babu Shyam Sundar Das has been replaced as his Hindi promoter and Hindi director
 unhone anek moulik granthon kii rachana kii
 Edited many texts
 kaashi nagari-prachaarini sabha kii sthapana main unka pramukh haath tha
 He made Hindi a place in the higher classes of the university with his efforts

 Till 1900, Shyamsunder Das edited the Saraswati magazine
 unhone hastlikhit granthon kii khoj kii tathaa hindi shabdhsagar kaa bhi sampaadan kiya
 In 1902, the building of the Nagar Pracharini Sabha was also constructed under his supervision
 1907 main unhone hindi arya bhashaa pustkaalay kii sthapana kii, pracheen mahatvapurn granthon kaa sampaadan kiya or shiksha str ke anuroop paathya pustakon kaa nirmaan kaary bhi aarambh kiya
 Ramchandra Shukla has written in the history of Hindi literature: shyaam sundar das na keval santhaan-nirmaataa the, balki prabandh-kala main bhi bejod the
 He worked determinedly to overcome the shortages of all areas of literature
 bhashaa tatvavetta ke rup main yaa siddhanton ke vyaakhyaata rup main unheen kii uplabdhiyon ke kaaran saahityalochan hindi ke vidhyaarthiyon kaa bahut samay tak kanthhaar bana rahaa
 In his mind, the notion remained that the basis of the theoretical review of Hindi should be made by combining Sanskrit and Western criticism-principles and with a special harmony
 shyaam sundar das se pehle hindi or nagari lipi ke liye vishesh rup se sankatpurna samay tha
 Pratap Narayan Mishra had established meetings for the promotion of Hindi in many places
 aisi hi ek sabha 1884 main ‘hindi uddharini pratinidhi madhya bharat sabha’ ke naam se prayag main pratishthit kii gayi
 Bharatendu Harishchandra also ventured several times for Nagari's entry into government offices, but he could not succeed
 iske baavjood praytn baraabar chalata rahaa
 Due to the court language being Urdu, the number of newly educated Urdu readers was more, due to which the work of publishing Hindi books could not proceed
 is sahitya-sankat ke atirikt nagari kaa pravesh sarkari dacrataron main na hone se nagari jaanane vaali janata ke saamne ghor sankat tha
 In the same period, Kashi Nagari Pracharini Sabha was established in 1893 from the industry of some enthusiastic students, among whom Babu Shyam Sundar Das was the chief
 yahan bhi ramchandra shukla kaa kathan yaad rakhana chahie ki, ‘sach puuchhie to is sabha kii sari samruddhi or kirti babu shyaam sundar das ke tyaag or satat parishram kaa fal he
 They continued to do it from the beginning till the end and kept it ready in many big industries
 iske pratham sabhapati bhaaratendu ke fufere bhai radhakrishna das hue
 The Nagari Prachar movement created new enthusiasm among Hindi-lovers and many people became devoted to the growth of literature

 yah mahabharat ke bhishmaparv kaa ang he
 The Gita has 18 chapters and 720 verses
 jaisaa gita ke shankar bhashya main kaha he- tan dharman bhagawata yathopadisht vedavyas: sarvagyobhagavan gitakhyai: saptabhi: shlokashatairu panibandh
 It is known that in the early 20th century, in front of Geeta Press Gorakhpur, there was the same text of Geeta which is available to us today

 Many basics are also safe in it

 They also support the current text
 gita kii gananaa prasthaantrayee main kii jaati he, jisamen upanishad or brahmasutra bhi sanmilit hai
 Therefore, according to Indian tradition, the place of Gita is the same as that of Upanishads and Brahmasutras
 gita ke mahatmaya main upanishdon ko gau or gita ko uskaa dugdh kaha gaya he
 This means that the Gita accepts the spirituality of the Upanishads in the Sarvansh
 upanishdon kii anek vidyaayein gita main hai
 For example, Ashwattha lore in relation to the nature of the world, Avyayamusha lore in the context of eternal Ajna Brahma, Aksha Purushu vidha in the matter of Para Prakriti or Jiva, and Ksharapurushu Vidya concerning Apara Prakriti or material world
 is prakaar vedon ke brahmavaad or upanishdon ke aadhyatm, in donon kii vishisht saamagree gita main sannivisht he
 In the words of Pushpika it is called theology
 gita main 'brahmavidya' kaa aashay nivrittiparak gyanmarg se he
 It is called Sankhyamat with which the Nivitvarigi Vibhagya is associated
 lekin gita upanishdon ke mode se aage badhkar us yug kii dein he, jab ek nayaa darshan janm le rahaa tha jo grihasthon ke pravriti dharm ko nivritti maarg ke samakaksh or utana hi faldaayak maanata tha
 The same signifies the word 'yogashastra' in the Pushpika of the Gita
 yahan ‘yogashastre’ kaa abhipraay ni:andeh karmyog se hi he
 Two definitions of yoga are found in the Gita
 ek nivritti maarg kii drushti se jisamen ‘samatvam yoga uchyate’ kaha gaya he arthath gunon ke vaishamy main samyabhav rakhana hi yoga he
 This is the position of Sankhya
 yoga kii duusari paribhaasha he ‘yoga: karmsu kaushalam’ arthath karmon main lage rahane par bhi aise upaay se karm karnaa ki vah bandhan kaa kaaran na ho or karm karanevaala usee asang yaa nirlep sthiti main apane ko rakh sake jo gyanamargiyon ko milti he
 The name of this device is Buddhayog and this is the essence of the Yoga of the Gita
 gita ke duusare adhyay main jo ‘tasya pragnapratishthita’ kii dhun pai jaati he, uskaa abhipraay nirlep karm kii kshamtavali buddhi se hi he
 This was not a situation of attaining renunciation by the renunciation of karma, but a plan to elevate the pre-existing mind to a state of disinterest while performing karma
 yahi gita kaa karmyog he
 Just as in many places in the Mahabharata, so is the interpretation and appreciation of the Sankhya path of Sankhya and the path of Karma
 ek kii ninda or duusare kii prashansa gita kaa abhimath nahin, donon maarg do prakaar kii ru chi rakhanevaale manushyon ke liye hitkar ho sakate hai or hai
 Probably no other book of the world renders the scripture of Karma with this beauty, this subtlety and objectivity
 is drushti se gita adbhut maanviya shaastra he
 Its vision is not one-sided, but all-round
 gita main darshan kaa pratipaadan karte hue bhi jo sahitya kaa anand he vah isaki atirikt visheshta he
 The description of the philosophy through cultured poetry is the personal grief of the Gita, which does not remain without enchanting any heart
 isiilie iskaa naam bhagavadgita padaa, bhagavan kaa gaaya hua gyaan
 The background of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita is the war of Mahabharata
 jis prakaar ek saamaanya manushya apane jivan kii samasyaon main ulajhakar kinkartavyavimudh ho jaataa he or uske pashchaat jivan ke samarangan se palaayan karne kaa man bana letaa he usee prakaar arjuna jo mahabharat kaa mahanayake he apane saamne aane vaali samasyaon se bhaybheet hokar jivan or kshatriya dharm se niraash ho gaya he, arjuna kii tarah hi ham sabhi kabhi-kabhi anishchay kii sthiti main yaa to hataash ho jate hai or yaa phir apni samasyaon se udign hokar kartavya vimukh ho jate hai
 The sages of India, after deep thought, imbibed the knowledge they gave to the Vedas
 inhen vedon kaa antim bhaag upanishad kehalaata he
 The characteristic of human life is the intellectual power acquired by human beings, and the knowledge contained in the Upanishads is not only the highest state of human intelligence but also gives a glimpse of what man can experience beyond the limits of intellect
 gita ke 18 adhyyon main varnit vishyon kii bhi kramprapt sangati he
 The name of the first chapter is Arjunvishad Yoga
 vah gita ke upadesh kaa vilakshan naatakeey rangamanch prastut karata he jisamen shrota or vaktaa donon hi kutuhal shanti ke liye nahin varan jivan kii pragadh samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye pravrutt hote hai
 Shaurya and patience, courage and strength made Arjuna's personality with the impressive amount of these four qualities and above all these four qualities were one and forgiveness, the other is wisdom
 balpradhan kshatradharm se praapt honevaali sthiti main pahunchakar sahasaa arjuna ke chitt par ek duusare hi prakaar ke manobhaav kaa akraman hua, carpanya kaa
 a strange kind of compassion filled his mind and his faint nature vanished
 jis kartavya ke liye vah katibaddh hua tha usase vah vimukh ho gaya
 On looking from above, his arguments in favor of this situation seem to be religious, but he himself has called it Karpanya Dosh and it is believed that due to this cuteness of mind, his natal nature was hurt or destroyed
 vah nirnay nahin kar paa rahaa tha ki yuddh kare athwa vairaygy le le
 What to do, what not to do, was not understood
 is manobhaav kii charam sthiti main pahunchakar usne dhanushbaan ek ore daal diya
 Krishna saw Arjuna's condition that Arjuna's body was fine but before the start of the war, the morale of that wonderful Kshatriya was broken
 bina man ke yah sharir khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Therefore, a guru duty came in front of Krishna
 at: tark se, buddhi se, gyaan se, karm kii charchaa se, vishwa ke swabhaav se, usamen jivan kii sthiti se, donon ke niamak avyay purush ke parichay se or us sarvopari param sattavan brahm ke saakshaat darshan se arjuna ke man kaa uddhaar karnaa, yahi unka lakshya hua
 The subject of this discussion is Gita
 pehle adhyay main saamaanya reeti se bhoomika rup main arjuna ne bhagwaan se apni sthiti kah di
 The second chapter is named Sankhyayoga
 isamen jivan kii do pracheen sanmanit paramparaon kaa tarkon dwaara varnan aayaa he
 Seeing Arjuna weeping in that sorrowful condition, Krishna has brought to his attention that this type of claviness and petty infirmity of heart is not suitable for a hero like Arjun
 krishna ne arjuna kii ab tak di hui sab yuktiyon ko pragnawad kaa jhootha rup kaha
 His trick is that Pragyadarshana essentially accepts all the events and situations of the world from time, karma and nature
 jeena or maranaa, janm lenaa or badhanaa, vishyon kaa aana or janaa
 Experiences of happiness and sorrow, these occur only in the world, this was also called the ancient Acharya synonymism
 kaal kii chakragati in sab sthitiyon ko laati he or le jaati he
 After knowing this nature of life, there is no mourning again
 yahi bhagwaan kaa vyangy he ki pragna ke drushtikon ko maanate hue bhi arjuna is prakaar ke moh main kyon pad gaya he
 An essential part of the above view was the continuity of life and the impermanence of the body
 nity jeev ke liye shok karnaa utana hi vyarth he jitna anitya sharir ko bachaane kii chintaa
 Both of these are unavoidable
 janm or mrityu baari baari se hote hi hai, aisa samajhakar shok karnaa uchit nahin he
 Then another view is of apostasy
 janm se hi prakruti ne sabake liye ek dharm niyat kar diya he
 In it comes the path of life, the periphery of desires, the power of karma
 isse nikal kar nahin bhaaga ja saktaa
 Even if someone runs away, nature again pulls him
 is prakaar kaal kaa parivartan yaa pariman, jeev kii nityata or apana swadharm yaa swabhaav jin yuktiyon se bhagavan, ne arjuna ko samajhaayaa he use unhone sankhya kii buddhi kaha he
 Further, even after Arjuna did not question, he also described the wisdom of the yogamarga
 yah buddhi karm yaa pravriti maarg ke aagrah kii buddhi he isamen karm karte hue karm ke fal kii aasakti se apane ko bachaana aavashyak he
 The biggest fear for the Karmayogi is that he gets trapped in the party of desire for fruit; He should avoid it
 arjuna ko andeh hua ki kya is prakaar kii buddhi praapt karnaa sambhav he
 What would be the situation of a person if he did deeds and no fruit, it was a practical doubt
 usne poocha ki is prakaar kaa drudh pragnawala vyakti jivan kaa vyavhaar kaise karata he? aana, janaa, khaanaa, pinaa, karm karnaa, unamem lipt hokar bhi nirlep kaise rahaa ja saktaa he? krishna ne kitne hi prakaar ke bahya indriyon kii apeksha man ke sanyam kii vyakhya kii he
 Through work, anger, fear, raga, malice, the mild mind is disturbed and the senses are not in control
 indriyajay hi sabase badi aatmajay he
 Even if someone gives up subjects from outside, the inner mind does not agree
 vishyon kaa swaad jab man se jaataa he, tabhi man prafullit, shant or sukhi hota he
 Rivers come in the sea, but he does not give up his dignity
 aise hi sansar main rahete hue, uske vyavhaaron ko sweekaarte hue, anek kaamanaayon kaa pravesh man main hota rahata he
 But those who do not lose their dignity only get peace
 ise pracheen aadhyatm paribhaasha main gita main brahmisthiti kaha he
 Thus, listening to the answer of Sankhya's explanation, in the third chapter called Karmayoga, Arjuna asked a clear question to get deeper into the subject that Sankhya and Yoga do you think well in both these passages and why not say that i am in both of them Whom should i adopt? To this, Krishna replied with the same clearness that there are two loyalties or lifespans in the world - jnana yoga for the Samkhists and karmayoga for the Karmargamis
 yahan koi vyakti karm chhod hi nahin saktaa
 Nature compels a person to perform actions with the effect of all three qualities
 karm se bachnewaalon ke prati ek badi shankaa he, vah yah ki ve upar se to karm chhod baithte hai par man hi man usamen duube rahete hai
 This situation is unbearable and Krishna has called it falsehood in the Gita
 man main karmedriyon ko rokkar karm karnaa hi saral maanviya maarg he
 Krishna even said as a challenge that without karma one cannot get food to eat
 phir krishna ne karm ke vidhaan ko chakra ke rup main upasthit kiya
 Not only are the creations of different persons threaded together on the social plane, but the relationship between man on earth and God of heaven is also dependent on the action cycle
 pratyaksh he ki yahan manushya karm karte hai, krishi karte hai or daivi shaktiyaan vrishti kaa jal bhejti hai
 Both grain and purgenes arise from karma
 ek main maanviya karm, duusare main daivi karm
 Then in favor of Karma, the idea of lok Sangraha has been given, that is, without Karma, the structure of society cannot stand
 jo lok ke netaa hai, janak jaise gyani hai, ve bhi karm main pravriti rakhte hai
 Krishna himself gave his own illustration and said that i am the form of Narayana, there is no work left for me
 phir bhi tandrarahit hokar karm karata hoon or anya log mere maarg par chalate hai
 The difference is that those who are foolish do the work by indulging but the knowledgeable does the work with disrespect
 gita main yaheen ek sabhipraay shabd buddhibhed he
 That is, it is not proper to uproot the people of ordinary understanding who are engaged in karma, because they cannot become knowledgeable, and if their karma is missed, then they will go astray on both sides
 chauthe adhyay main, jiskaa naam gyaan-karm-sanyas-yoga he, yah bataaya gaya he ki gyaan praapt karke karm karte hue bhi karmsanyas kaa fal kis upaay se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In this true Karmayoga is considered to occur in the tradition of the Chakravarti kings
 mandhata, sudarshan aadi anek chakravarti raajaaon ke drushtaant die gaye hai
 This is the famous assurance of the Gita that when there is defamation of religion, then there is an incarnation of God among humans, that is, the power of God is especially tangible
 yaheen par ek vaakya vishesh dhyaan dene yogya he- kshipran hi manushe loke siddhirbhavatee karmaja 
 'karma se siddhi' - There is no more effective sutra in Gitadarshan
 kintu gitatv is sutara main itnaa sudhaar or karata he ki vah karm asang bhav se arthath falasakti se bachakar karnaa chahie
 In the fifth chapter, again she has gone somewhere in the form of tips and perseverance
 isamen karm ke saath jo man kaa sambandh he, uske sanskaar par yaa use vishuddh karne par vishesh dhyaan dilaayaa gaya he
 It has also been said that there is no difference between Sankhya and Yoga by reaching a high level
 kisi ek maarg par thik prakaar se chale to samaan fal praapt hota he
 By surrendering all the deeds of life, a person reaches the pole point of absolute peace and does not indulge in karmic water like a lotus blooming in water
 chatha adhyay aatmasanyam yoga he jiskaa vishay naam se hi prakat he
 The number of subjects is the restraint of the most senses - this is the squeeze of karma and knowledge
 sukh main or dukh main man kii samaan sthiti, ise hi yoga kehete hai
 The noun of the seventh chapter is Jnana Vigyan Yog
 ye pracheen bhartiya darshan kii do paribhaashaayen hai
 Among them, the word science was very important from the Vedic point of view
 sristi ke nanaatv kaa gyaan vigyaan he or nanaatv se ekatv kii ore pragati gyaan he
 Both these views are suitable for humans
 is prasang main vigyaan kii drushti se aparaa or para prakruti ke in do roopon kii jo sunishchit vyakhya yahan gita ne di he, vah avashya dhyaan dene yogya he
 Apara Prakriti has eight elements, Panchabhuta, Mind, Wisdom and Ego
 jis and se maanav kaa janm hota he
 These eight live in it
 kintu yah praakrit sarg he arthath yah jad he
 In this, the consciousness that comes from contact with the efforts of God is called Para Prakriti; He is a living being
 aath tatwon ke saath milakar jivan navaan tatv ho jaataa he
 In this chapter, many forms of God are mentioned, whose further expansion comes in the tenth chapter called Vibhutiog
 yaheen vishesh bhagwati drushti kaa bhi ullekh he jiskaa sutara-vasudev: sarvamiti, sab vasu yaa shariron main ek hi devtatv he, usee kii sangya vishnu he
 But in the people according to their own idi, the same deity is worshiped in many names and forms
 ve sab thik hai
 But it is good that a wise person recognizes the universe which is the highest peak of spiritual science
 aathven adhyay kii sangya akshar brahmyog he
 Akshar Vidya expanded in Upanishads
 gita main us aksharavidya kaa saar kah diya gaya he-akshar brahm paraman, arthath parabrahm kii sangya akshar he
 Spirituality is the name of the combined composition of man, that is, organism and body
 jeevasanyukt bhautik deh kii sangya kshar he or keval shaktitatv kii sangya aadhidaivak he
 The way these three powers work together in the body, the God, and the ghost are called Adhigyas
 gitakar ne do shlokon main in chah paribhaashaon kaa swaroop band diya he
 In the words of Gita, ॐ monosyllable is Brahman
 nawein adhyay ko raajaguhyayog kaha gaya he, arthath yah aadhyatm vidya vidyaraji he or yah guhya gyaan sabamein shreshth he
 The word Raja also had a meaning in mind
 atev man kii divya shaktimayon ko kis prakaar brahmamay banaaya jaay, isaki yukti hi rajvidya he
 In this area, the representation of Brahmanism is predominant, from which the creation of the expressed world is repeated
 veda kaa samast karmkand yajna, amrit, or mrityu, sant or asant, or jitne bhi devi devtaa he, sabakaa paryavsaan brahm main he
 The variety of Devpuja which is popular in the world is also right in its place, this vision of coordination was acceptable to the Bhagwat Acharyas, in fact it was their great power
 isi drushtikon kaa vichaar yaa vyakhya dasven adhyay main pai jaati he
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 iskaa saar yah he ki lok main jitne devtaa hai, sab ek hi bhagwaan, kii vibhutiyaan hai, manushya ke samast gun or avagun bhagwaan kii shakti ke hi rup hai
 Wisdom may be able to explain these liberated gods, but they are there in the world
 koi pipal ko pooj rahaa he
 Some mountain, river or sea, some fish and turtles
 yon kitne devtaa hai, iskaa koi ant nahin
 This abundance of deities is found everywhere in the history of the world
 bhagwaton ne inaki satta ko sweekaarte hue sabko vishnu kaa rup maanakar samanvay kii ek nai drushti pradaan kii
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 jo satv jeev balayukt athwa chamatkarayukt he, vah sab bhagwaan kaa rup he
 Considering this, the mind gets into an uncontrolled state
 11wein adhyay kaa naam vishvaroopadarshan yoga he
 In this, Arjuna saw the world form of God
 viraat rup kaa arth he maanviya dharaatal or paridhi ke upar jo anant vishwa kaa pranavant rachanavidhan he, uskaa saakshaat darshan
 The quadrilateral form of Vishnu is benign on the human plane
 jab arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa viraat rup dekha to uske mastak kaa visphoton hone laga
 'directo na jaane na labhe f shame' These same sentences of panic came out of his mouth and he prayed that the natural condition which God has placed for man is sufficient
 13wein adhyay main ek sidhaa vishay kshetra or kshetrajna kaa vichaar he
 This is the body area, the person who knows it is a field expert
 14wein adhyay kaa naam gunatray vibhaag yoga he
 This subject is a squeeze of all the Vedic, philosophical and mythological metaphysics — there are many interpretations of the three gunas — trios called sattva, raja, tam
 gunon kii samyavastha kaa naam pradhan yaa prakruti he
 a pathless creation is born from the contrast of qualities
 akelaa satv shant swabhaav se nirmal prakaash kii tarah sthir rahata he or akelaa tam bhi jadvat nishcesht rahata he
 But Rajoguna, who is in the middle of the two, drags them to the ground of Chesta
 gati tatv kaa naam hi rajas he
 The name of the 15th chapter is Purushottamayoga
 isamen vishwa kaa ashwatth ke rup main varnan kiya gaya he
 This ashwattha-like world is a great expansion
 desh or kaal main iskaa koi ant nahin he
 But the root or center of it, which is called the upward, is Brahm
 On the one hand, the ultimate glory, which gives rise to the cosmopolitan Ashwattha, is manifested in the form of the Sun and the Moon, on the other hand, it is in a Chaitanya center or Zoological
 Is in the body
 jaisaa gita main spasht kaha he-ahan vaishwanaro bhutva praninaan dehamashrith: 
 There is no more mystery than globalism or pranamayi consciousness
 nar yaa purush teen hai-kshar, akshar or avyay
 The name of the Panchabhutas is Kshar, the name of Prana is Akshar and the noun of Manastattva or Consciousness is indestructible
 inhen teen naron kii ekatra sthiti se maanvi chetana kaa janm hota he use hi rishiyon ne vaishwanar agni kaha he
 In the 16th chapter, the department of Dewasur property is described
 aarambh se hi rigdev main sristi kii kalpana daivi or asuri shaktiyon ke rup main kii gai he
 It is a fantasy of two forms of creation, one good and the other bad
 ek prakaash main, doosraa andhkaar main
 One nectar, the other mortal
 ek satya, doosraa anrut
 The noun of the 17th chapter is Shraddhatraya Vigyan Yoga
 iskaa sambandh sat, raj or tam, in teen gunon se hi he, arthath jisamen jis gun kaa pradurbhaav hota he, uski shraddha yaa jivan kii nishtha waisi hi ban jaati he
 Yagya, penance, charity, deeds are all conducted with three types of devotion
 yahan tak ki aahaar bhi teen prakaar kaa he
 The Gita has explained their differences and characteristics here
 18wein adhyay kii sangya mokshasanyas yoga he
 It contains a summary and epilogue of all the teachings of the Gita
 yahan pun: balpurvak maanav jivan ke liye teen gunon kaa mahatv kaha gaya he
 There is no one among the human beings of the earth and among the gods of heaven who is saved from these three qualities of nature
 manushya ko bahut dekh bhalkar chalanaa aavashyak he jisase vah apni buddhi or vritti ko buraai se bachaa sake or kya kaary he, kya acarya he, isko pahchaan sake
 The intellect which properly recognizes religion and unrighteousness, bondage and salvation, instinct and retirement, is the true wisdom and is the true achievement of man
 is prakaar bhagwaan ne jivan ke liye vyaavhaarik maarg kaa upadesh dekar ant main yah kaha he ki manushya ko chahie ki sansar ke sab vyavhaaron kaa sachai se paalan karte hue, jo akhand chaitanya tatv he, jise ishwar kehete hai, jo prayek praani ke hriddesh yaa centre main virajman he, usamen vishwaas rakhe, uskaa anubhav kare
 He is the entity's power, he is consciousness and he is the source of supreme bliss
 sanskrit sahitya kii parampara main un granthon ko bhashya, kehete hai jo duusare granthon ke arth kii vrihad vyakhya yaa tikaa prastut karte hai
 The Bhagavad Gita is also one of the three texts that had to clarify their perspective in order to establish any new philosophy or any new form of philosophy in the Indian philosophical tradition
 gita par anek achaaryon evam vidwaanon ne tikaayen kii hai
 Their short list according to sects is as follows: inke atirikt maharashtra sant gyandev yaa gyaneshwarkrut bhavarthadipika naam kii tikaa prasiddh he jo gita ke gyaan ko bhavatmak kavyastylee main prakat karti he
 In the present era, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilakkrit Geetarasya Tika, which was first introduced in 1915 with very detailed role and deliberation
 main puna se prakashit hui thi, gita sahitya main mahatvapurn sthaan rakhti he
 He has made such a diversion in bringing the original meaning of Gita to scholars, which was not possible till today after Shankaracharya
 vastut: shankaracharya kaa bhashya gita kaa mukhya arth gyanaprak karata he jabaki tilak ne gita ko karm kaa pratipadak shastr siddh kiya he
 Among all the languages available on the Bhagavad Gita, the element of Shri Jayadayal Goindka is the most popular and popular
 iskaa prakaashan gitapress ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Aaj Tak has sold 100 million copies
 shrimadbhagavadgita badalte saamaajik paridrishyon main apni mahatta ko banaae hue hai or isi kaaran takneekee vikaas ne isaki uplabdhta ko badhaayaa he, tathaa adhik bodhgamy banane kaa prayaas kiya he
 In the serial Mahabharata, aired on Doordarshan, Bhagavad Gita was a special attraction, while in the serial Sri Krishna, the Bhagwad Gita was highly researched and shown as a series of episodes
 isaki ek vishesh baat yah rahi ki gita se sambandhit saamaanya manushya ke sandehon ko arjuna ke prashnon ke madhyam se uttarit karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Apart from this, the serial gita-rahasya by Nitish Bhardwaj was completely focused on different dimensions of Gita itself
 internet par bhi aaj anekanek websiten is vishay par bahumadhyamon ke dwaara vishad jaankaree detii hai
 Shrimad Bhagwadgita is currently attracting attention of people not only in India but also abroad with her philosophical approach towards life more than religion
 nishkaam karm kaa gita kaa sandesh prabandhan guruon ko bhi lubhaa rahaa he
 It is included in the most famous books of all religions of the world
 gita press gorakhpur jaisi dharmik sahitya kii pustakon ko kaaphi kam mulya par uplabdh karaane vaale prakaashan ne bhi kai aakaar main arth or bhashya ke saath shrimadbhagavadgita ke prakaashan dwaara ise aam janata tak pahunchane main kaaphi yogadan diya he
 The teachings of the Gita are very ancient yoga
 shri bhagavan kehete hai ise maine sabase pehle surya se kaha tha
 The Sun is the symbol of knowledge, so the words of Shri God mean that even before the creation of the earth, i have given this knowledge to the devotees who have done many forms of research
 yah ishwariya vaani he jisamen sampoorn jivan kaa saar he evam aadhaar he
 Who am I? What is this body? Is my beginning and end with this body? Will i exist after my body renunciation? Where and in what form will this existence exist? What is the reason for me coming into the world? What will happen after leaving my body, where will i go? These things keep revolving in the heart of any curious person
 ham sadaa in baton ke bare main sochate hai or apane ko, apane swaroop ko nahin jaan pate
 In the Gita Shastra, the answers to all these questions have been readily given by Shri Bhagwan through religious dialogue
 is deh ko jisamen 36 tatv jeevatma kii upasthiti ke kaaran judakar kaary karte hai, kshetra kaha he or jeevatma is kshetra main nivas karata he, vahi is deh kaa swami he parantu ek teesraa purush bhi he, jab vah prakat hota he; adhidaiv arthath 36 tatwon vaale is deh ko or jeevatma kaa naash kar daalata he
 This perfect man is the ultimate state and ultimate truth
 yahi nahin, deh main sthit or deh tyagkar jate hue jeevatma kii gati kaa yatharth vaigyanik env tarksangat varnan gita shaastra main hua he
 The soul is eternal and the soul has attained the spirit of life
 sharir ke mar jane par jeevatma apane karmanusaar vibhinn yoniyon main vicharan karata he
 The Gita begins with the word Dharma and at the end of the eighteenth chapter of the Gita it is called Dharma Samvad
 dharm kaa arth he dhaaran karne vaala athwa jise dhaaran kiya gaya he
 The one who holds is called the soul and the one who holds it is nature
 aatma is sansar kaa beej arthath pita he or prakruti garbhadhaaran karne vaali yoni arthath mata he
 The word Dharma is used in the Gita from place to place for self-nature and living nature
 isi paripeksh main dharm evam adharm ko samajhnaa aavashyak he
 The nature of the soul is religion or it is said that religion is spirit
 aatma kaa swabhaav he purna shuddh gyaan, gyaan hi anand or shaanti kaa akshay dham he
 On the contrary, ignorance signifies unrest, tribulation and unrighteousness
 aatma akshay gyaan kaa strot he
 Kriya Shakti arises from different amounts of knowledge power, birth of nature
 prakruti ke gun satva, raj, tam kaa janm hota he
 Excess of sattva-raja gives rise to religion, demonic circles prevail in excess of tam-raja and the establishment of dharma means to establish the nature of virtues, for the growth of satoguna, soul attaining indestructible Brahmi status, its resolve She incarnates herself and performs incarnation
 sampoorn gita shaastra kaa nichod he buddhi ko hameshaa sookshm karte hue mahabuddhi aatma main lagaaye rakkho tathaa sansar ke karm apane swabhaav ke anusaar saral rup se karte raho
 It is easy to do nature's karma and it is difficult to follow the other's nature's karma, because every living being is born with a different nature, it becomes easy to live in the nature that has come into the world
 shri bhagwaan ne sampoorn gita shaastra main baar-baar atmrat, aatm sthit hone ke liye kaha he
 It is easy for the intellect to become detached while doing natural deeds, so it is considered the definitive path
 yadhyapi alag-alag dekha jaay to gyaan yoga, buddhi yoga, karm yoga, bhakthi yoga aadi kaa gita main upadesh diya he parantu sookshm drushti se vichaar kiya jaay to sabhi yoga buddhi se shri bhagwaan ko arpan karte hue kiye ja sakate hai isse anasakt yoga nishkaam karm yoga swatah siddh ho jaataa he
 Just as before Newton the force of gravity worked, but Newton gave the terms of the term to make the world aware of the proclaimed principles of "law of gravity", which is known as Newton's theory of gravitation

 This language is applied in the sacred hymns and texts of the Zoroastrian Abesta, the Zoroastrian religion
 yah bhashaa irani bhashaaon main se ek he
 The Iranian language and the Indian language combine to form the indo-iranian language group, which is a branch of the Bharopeli language family
 avestan bhashaa ke is aadhunik bhashaai vargeekaran ke baavjood, avestan bhashaa kii bhugolic sthiti kaa nirdhaaran kisi bhi aadhaar se purna nahin he
 According to modern scholars, the origin of the Avestan language originated in eastern Iran, but evidence has also been found of the Avestan language originating northwest Iran
 avestan bhashaa do alag roopon main vibhakt he: 1) Ancient Avestan or Gothic Avestan: This form of Avastan language was used to compose the saga and ancient sections of Yasan
 gothic avestan ek jatil vyakarnayukt pracheen bhashaa he jisamen aath case forms or ek ucch inflected naam pranali shaamil he
 This language is closely related to Vedic Sanskrit and shares many cognates with Sanskrit
 2)young Avestan: is bhashaai rup ko abhesta ke adhik bhaag nirmaan main prayog kiya gaya he
 This was intended for the construction of Yasht, Visperad, Bhemdidad and a few blocks of Yasn
 guide angreji bhashaa ke mahaan bhartiya upanyaaskaar aar ke narayan kaa upanyaas he
 It is the most famous novel by RK Narayan
 ise desh or videshon main jabardast saraahna mili he
 Like most of his works, the guide is also based on Malgudi
 malgudi ek kaalpanik sthaan he
 It is often considered a fictional town in South India; But according to the statement of the author himself, "if i say that Malgudi is a town in South India, then it will also be incomplete truth, because the symptoms of Malgudi will be found everywhere in the world
 " is upanyaas main raju naamak ek saamaanya pathpradarshak ke aadhyatmik guru banane kii kahani he
 Raju is a railway guide who becomes crazy about Rosie
 roji, marco naamak ek maanavshastri kii upekshit patni he
 Rosie was very fond of dance, but Marco does not allow it
 raju kii baat maanakar roji ne ekbar phir apane sapanom ko puraa karne or marco ko chhod dene kaa man banaaya
 Raju becomes Rosie's stage manager and Raju's management skills soon make her a successful dancer
 lekin raju ke man main ahm aa gaya or usne roji par niyantran kii koshish kii
 Gradually, the relationship between Raju and Rosie became bitter
 marco ekbar phir saamne aata he
 Meanwhile, Raju gets caught in a case of forgery and is imprisoned for two years
 sajaa puraa kar jab raju jail se baahar aata he to ek gaanv ke log use sadhu maan maan lete hai
 By then, he has a disgust towards Malgudi and Rosie and takes refuge in an abandoned temple in the same village
 vah choti-moti samasyaon main gaanv waalon kii madad karata he or is tarah vah nami sadhu ho jaataa he
 Once there is a famine in that village
 tab gaanv vaale use varsha ke liye upwas karne ko kehete hai
 Raju sits on a fast after obeying the people
 media dwaara prachaarit karne par use dekhne dur-dur se log aate hai
 Several days passed in the state of fasting
 ek din vah jab nadi ke kinare puja archana ke liye pahunchataa he to use lagata he ki pahaad se pani gir rahaa he
 Even at the end of the novel, the question of whether Raju dies of hunger or famine ends
 roji guide ke sabase pramukh paatro main se ek he
 In the novel she is presented as a beautiful dancer, who is married to an anthropologist named Marco
 shaadi roji ke liye abhishaap sabit hota he kyonki marco apane kaam ke sivaa kuch nahin dekhtaa he
 Does not even try to understand Rosie's feeling
 roji nrity ke prati divaani he
 But Marco does not allow him to dance
 vah har tarah se koshish karti he lekin use safalataa nahin milti he
 When Marco leaves her in Malguri, she stays with Raju and spends all her time dancing
 roji dharmik pravriti kii he or vah devi saraswati main vishwaas karti he
 There is a statue of bronze in his office
 vah dhan-daulat ko lekar logon ke bhedbhaav nahin karti thi
 Raju likes to meet rich and effective people but Rosie does not give such people a sense
 As an artist, she respects artists and wants to be among them
 safalataa usamen abhimaan nahin bharti he balki vah nrity main safal karier ke baavjood jameen se judi rahati he
 Once Raju gets angry that Rosie spends time with the actors, not spending time with him
 roji paramparaagat bhartiya patni kii tarah he
 She treats her husband like a god
 lekin uskaa pati use ek vastu samajhataa he or uski kala ko bandar kii uchhal-kud
 vah uskaa apmaan karata he
 When Marco learns about Rosie and Raju's close relationship, she becomes angry and ignores him
 roji ne marco ko badalanaa chaha lekin vah nahin badla
 isse pataa chalata he ki roji bahut sahansheel or ashavan pravriti kii thi
 Even after becoming a successful dancer, she had a sense of respect for her husband
 938 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year 938 BC or the year before his birth is considered as the basis of the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous

 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 938 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kaliyuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc
 computer vigyaan main ek software sarthak kramadeshon or zaruri soochnaaon kaa ek aisa tantra he jo computer ke yantransh or duusare softwaron ko aadesh dekar kramadeshak kaa manachaaha kaam karata he
 In practice, if a computer is defined, then we can call hardware as human body and software as its soul
 hardware computer ke hisson ko kehete hai, jinhen ham apni aankhon se dekh sakate hai, chhu sakate hai athwa aujaaron se unpar kaary kar sakate hai
 This is the real substance
 iske vipareet software koi padaarth nahin he
 These are the information, commands or methods on which the computer hardware works
 computer hardware software se parichit hote hai athwa software computer ke hardware se parichit evam unpar aadhaarit hote hai
 Earlier, there was only one computer system for a task and it was given programs at the mechanical level, which was economical to change
 takanic ke vikaas ke saath aise yantransh bananaa takneekee rup se sambhav or aarthik rup se laabhadaayak ho sakaa
 It was very difficult to program early computer systems because at that time the theory that software was also in the initial state of a set of information which was safe in the memory of a device
 tab 'panch card' naamak saadhaaran se yantransh par computer ke yantransh ko diye jane vaale kramadesh ke nirdesh sidhe likhe jate the
 All instructions were given to the computer software with the help of only two digits - '0' and '1'
 ise dwaidh nirdesh kehete he, dwaidh rup ke hi kramadeshon ko hi yantransh lagu kar saktaa he
 In technical terms, there are three types of software
 “system software” yah ek aisa program hota he, jinka kaam system arthath computer ko chalaanaa tathaa use kaam karne laayak banaae rakhana he
 System software adds life to the hardware
 oparating system, compiler aadi system sofyware ke mukhya bhaag hai
 'application software' is called programs that are written to perform core tasks based on our computer

 Three types of rights, ie copyright, trade secret, and patents, affect computer software
 software ko patent karaane kaa mudda vivaadaaspad he tathaa kuch kathin bhi
 We have discussed it separately in patents and computer software
 object code computer ko chalaata he or yah sadaa prakashit hota he, parantu kya yah kisi chiz kaa varnan he athwa nahin is bare main shankaa thi
 Under the TRIPS agreement, it was said that computer programs should be protected like copyright
 isaliye object code hamaare desh main tathaa sansar ke anya deshon main isi prakaar se surakshit kiya gaya he
 Object code of a computer program is published, but not everyone's source code is published
 jin kamputer program ke sorce code prakashit kiye jate hai unamem to ve copirite se surakshit hote hai
 But computer programs whose source code is not published are protected like trade secret
 sorce code se object code compail karnaa aasaan he; yah hameshaa kiya jaataa he or isi tarah program likhaa jaataa he
 But the opposite is that it is impossible to find the source code from the object code, but it is very difficult and expensive
 is par reverse ingeneering kaa kanoon bhi lagu hota he
 That is why the source code is not published
 ise gopneey rakh kar, ise zyada aasaani se surakshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Reverse engineering is also an interesting subject, more on this sometime
 open sorce sauftware main sorce code hameshaa prakashit hota he
 What kind of authority its writers have over it depends on the terms of the licenses under which they are published
 open sorce sauftware main kuch license kii sharten use copileft karti hai
 It is also known as free software or GPOLD software
 in software ko koi bhi vyakti muft main downlod kar saktaa he, istemaal kar saktaa he, vitareet kar saktaa haievam isame apni jarurat ke mutabik badlaav bhi kar saktaa he
 Open source software is a wonderful tool of technology, science and art, not just mechanical content

 Kalil or colloid is a chemical mixture in which one object is uniformly dispersed in another
 parikshepit vastu ke kan mishran me keval nilambit rahete he naa ki ek vilyan kii tarah 
 This is because the size of the particles in the membrane is larger than the size of the particles present in the solution - these particles are so small that they are completely dispersed in the mixture to form a homogenous mixture, but not so large that the light Scour and do not dissolve
 is parikshepan ke chalate kuch kalil vilyan jaise dikhte hai
 a bud system has two distinct phases: the first dispersion phase and the second continuous phase
 ek kalil pranali thos, drav yaa gasiy ho sakati he
 The table below gives a comparative analysis of the diameter of the particles of the plume in a homogenous and uniform mixture
 : Therefore, the collicular suspensions are intermediates for homogenous and homogeneous mixtures
 kalil ke liye angreji main kollid shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The word is derived from the Greek word kola which means 'glue'
 san 1861 i
 main ek angrej vaigyanik, tamas graham, ne dekha ki albumin, sares, gond, maand, silisik amla or isi prakaar ke anya padaarth jal main ghole jane par jaev jhilli ke chhidron se chhanakar nahin nikal pate
 In contrast, hydrolysis of sugars, urea, sodium, chloride, etc
 are released from the pores of the bio-membrane
 purv prakaar ke padaarth adhikansh main acristalia rup main milte hai is gun ke aadhaar par jal main viley padaartho kaa do virgon main vibhaajan kiya gaya: ek ve padaarth, jo crystalia the or jal main vilyan ke pashchaat jaev jhilli ke chhidron se bahirgat ho sakate the, crystalloid kehalaae or duusare ve, jo acristalia the or jal main gholne par jaev jhilli ke chhidron se nikalne main samarth nahin ho sakate the, kalil kehalaae
 But now it has been proved that crystalline substances like sugars and sodium chloride can also be obtained in the appropriate medium in the form of pigments
 kalilavastha main kalil kan ek avichhinn madhyam main bikhare rahete hai
 Thus, there are two components in the buds
 neeche kii suchi main pehla naam madhyam kaa or doosraa naam vitarit padaarth kaa he : The size of the calculus is particularly important
 aakaar main kalilkan anuon se bade hote hai, kintu aise sabhi kanon se, jo sookshmdarshi se dekhe ja sakate hai, ye aakaar main chote rahete hai
 They extend 10–5 cm
 From 10–7 cm Happens till
 yadhyapi upar di gai suchi ke prayek mail ke kalil praapt kiye ja sakate hai, phir bhi or prakaar ke kalil adhik prayukt hote hai or inhen kaa adhyayan bhi adhik vistaarpurvak kiya gaya he
 The solids of the solid or liquid distributed in the medium of water are called Sauls
 carbonic or acarbonic donon prakaar ke padaarth anek roopon main kalilavastha main paae jate hai
 Scientifically or technically, there is hardly any branch in which the buds are not used significantly
 apni isimhatta ke kaaran kalil vigyaan vishesh rup se hota gaya he
 In order to distinguish between the qualities of the Kalils, they have been divided into two major classes
 pehle varg main dhatviya prakaar ke kalil, jaise swarna kalil aadi, hai or duusare varg main protein prakaar ke kalil hai, jaise gelatin aadi
 Their special qualities are as follows: in donon prakaar ke kalilon ke liye jin shabdon kaa vishesh prayog hota he ve hai jalasantrasi or jalpremi 
 They are also called lyophobic and lyophilic in English in order
 yah vargeekaran purnroopen santoshjanak nahin kaha ja saktaa, kyonki katipay kalilon ke kuch gun donon charam virgon ke apokshakrit gunon ke madhyavarti hote hai
 These types of waterways have some metal oxides or hydroxides, some insoluble phosphate, molybdate, tungstate etc
 kuch log kalilon ko alambaabh or pysabh ke do virgon main vibhajit karte hai
 Apart from these, there is also a third category of Kalils which has become particularly important now
 yah varg kalileey vidyudvishleshya kehalaata he
 Soap water is a typical example of this
 in jalakalilon main vidyucchalakata bhi hoti he
 They are now being used more as refinements
 kalilon main atisookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se browneey gati ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Mergers do not have this action
 jab ek twri kiranpath kendrit karke jalakalil ke madhya se bheji jaati he tab kiranpath dugdhabh ho jaataa he or bahirgat kirane dhravatv praapt kar leti hai
 The reasons for this are the similarity in the size and wavelength of light and the uniformity in the wavelength of the distributed matter and the wavelength of the light and the alternation of the opposing material exceeds the mean of the different medium
 shaktishaalee sookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se tindal ke prabhaav dwaara kalilkanon ko dekha ja saktaa he
 When viewed in this way, the calculus appears like the illuminated stars
 saath hi inaki gati twri, aniyamit or nirantar hoti he
 This motion is called Brownian motion
 isi gati se padaartho ke gatyaatmakataa-siddhant ke vichaaron kii praayogic pushti hui he
 By extracting the Avogadro constant according to this theory, it has been proved that the values of the Avogadro-constant derived from this method by considering the experimental error are comparable to the values of the constant extracted from other methods
 parin ne mastic gond ke kalil par pariksha karke aavogadro niyatank kaa maan 6
510E23 nikaala he
 The radius of the appropriate mastic glue particles in the experiment was 6
5 x 10–4
 anek pravidhik vidhiyon ke liye kalil nirmit karnaa aavashyak he
 Hydrographic plains can only be made easily, because watertight plots are reversible
 jalasantrasi kalilon ke nirmaan ke liye kai vidhiyaan prayukt hoti hai
 These methods can be divided into two classes - integration and disintegration
 pehali vidhi main aanaviya aakaar ke kanon ko dhire-dhire tab tak badhaayaa jaataa he jab tak ve kalilon kaa aakaar nahin praapt kar lete or unke adhik badhane kii gati kisi sthayitv pradaan karanevaale padaarth kii upasthiti se, athwa kisi jalpremi kalil ke mila dene se, niyantrit kar di jaati he
 By this method many metals, hydroxides, insoluble salts and silver halides used in photography have been made in the bud
 duusari vidhi se bade-bade kanon ko chote-chote kanon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 In the braiding method metal pieces are obtained by breaking large pieces of metals with the help of electric arc
 is kaaran is vidhi ko vighatan kii vidhi kaha jaataa he, kintu vastav main ye kalil bhi ekikaran kii vidhi se hi banate hai
 The metal evaporates at high temperature of the arc
 phir vaashp ke ati sookshm kan ekikrut hokar kalilkanon kaa aakaar praapt kar lete hai
 In fact kalil-mill is the major means of making Kalil by partition
 is yantra main do platen, jo ek duusare ke atyant sameep rahati hai, paraspar vipareet disha main gumti he
 The material to be delivered is sent between these two plates with the appropriate medium
 is prakaar kan chote hokar kalil kanon kaa aakaar grahan kar lete hai
 For the treatment of the buds produced by any of the two methods, they are subjected to a different action by dialysis with a geminal substance
 aisa karne ke liye kalil ko parchament yaa celophen ke jhole main rakhaa jaataa he
 This bag is now kept in pure solvent
 yah vilaayak hi kalil kaa madhyam hota he
 Electrical dialysis can make refinement more complete and faster
 jalpremi kalil atyant sthaayee hote hai or vidyudvishleshya kii laghumatraaon ke prati niskriy hote hai
 Their stability is due to their solubility in the medium
 in kalilkanon kaa bahya tal madhyam ke anuon se dhakaa rahata he
 In this way the free energy of the outer plane is negligible
 isse ye kan aakaar main badhane main asamarth rahete hai
 In addition, it has been observed that water-soluble materials reduce the interstellar stress of the medium
 is prabhaav se bhi kalilon kaa sthayitv niyantrit rahata he
 The stability of the drainage systems is due to the charge located on the tubes
 kalilkanon ke bahya tal par aavesh kaa srijan unke dwaara avashoshit yanon ke kaaran hota he
 The charge at the bottom of the calculus decreases with the addition of an electrolyte, and gradually a situation arises when the bottom of the calculus at the lowest concentration of the electrolyte is unable to resist the forces of integration
 is prakaar vidyudvishleshya kaa vah nimnatam sandran, jo kisi kalil kii ek nishchit maatra ke avakshepan main samarth hota he, kalil kaa avakshepan maan kaha jaataa he
 In general, the higher the valence of the ion of the electrolyte, which is opposite to the charge of the alkaline, the stronger the precipitation power of the electrolyte
 jalasantrasi kalilon ko vidyudvishleshyon se surakshit rakhane ke liye unamem jalpremi kalil mila die jate hai
 This method is called conservation method
 swarnakalil ko gelatin kii sookshm maatra se avakshipt kiya ja saktaa he kintu is protein kii adhik maatra is kalil ko sthayitv pradaan karti he
 According to Jigmondi, the gold content of a black preservative is the number of milligrams of the preservative in the presence of 10 cubic centimeters of gold in the presence of 1 cubic cm of sodium chloride
 Can be precipitated by a solution whose concentration is 10 percent
 kalil kaa sangrakshan vishesh mahatv rakhata he or atyant pracheen samay se iskaa vyavhaar hota rahaa he
 It has already been said that there is charge on the black particles
 kalil par aavesh kaa prakaar gyaat karne ke liye saral avasorana prayog kiye ja sakate hai
 Positive compounds are absorbed by silica jelly and negative compounds by aluminum hydroxide
 jalasantrasi kalil ke sthayitv ke liye aavesh kaa sthaan pramukh he
 The type of charge depends on the physical nature of the substance and on the electrodynamic that provides stability to the particle
 udaahranarth yadi rajat iodide ke saul ko len to usapar aavesh kaa prakaar dhanatmak yaa rinatmak donon hi ho saktaa he
 If there is a subtle excess of silver nitrate in Kalil, then Saul will be positive
 iske vipareet yadi potacium iodide kaa aadhiky hua to saul rinatmak ho jayega
 It has been observed that the charge of the silver iodide membrane becomes positive due to the presumptive adsorption of the positive silver ion, and the charge of this ion becomes negative due to the negative ion adsorption of the positive iodide
 kalileey tal par aavesh kii maatra or vibhav dhan-vidyut-sanchaaran dwaara parimapit kiye jate hai
 Saul is filled in a tube containing two platinum electrodes
 ab saul main disht vidyuddhara pravaahit kii jaati he
 If the particles move towards the positive, there is a negative electric charge on them
 vidyut kshetra main kanon kii is prakaar kii gati dhan-vidyut-sanchaaran kehalaati he
 This speed can be conveniently measured by suitable optical methods
 veg ke maapan dwaara vidyudvibhav kii gananaa kii ja sakati he
 This voltage is commonly called electrical-dynamic-voltage
 yah vidyutagtyatmk vibhav us samay bhi dekha jaataa he jab vidyudvishleshiya vilyan ko kisi sanrdhra tanupat se hokar bheja jaataa he
 Research has also been conducted on two other related verbs
 ye hai dharavibhav or avakshepan vibhav
 The electrical dynamic potential is different from the Nernst electrochemical potential
 ab siddh ho gaya he ki vaidyuthik rasinic vibhav vah vibhav he jo vitarit kala or vitaran madhyam ke mukhya aaytan ke bich hota he
 The electrodynamic potential is the voltage that lies between the main volume of the distribution medium in the stationary part of the bicameral plane attached to that distributed art
 vitarit kala se sanlagn dwiktal kaa vaastavik swabhaav ab bhi kalpana kaa vishay he
 Nevertheless, it has been known that the electrodynamic-potential is particularly affected by the ions present
 gas ke niyam kalil vilyanon par thik baithte hai, iske paryaapt pramaan hai
 The curvature pressure of a Kalil can be calculated by the following equation: jahaan: Now, as the viscosity pressure is inversely proportional to the size of the particle, it makes it clear that the infusion pressure of the spiral should decrease and their volume should also increase with the distribution volume
 is prakaar saadhaarant: saulon kii rasakarshan daab kam hi hoti he or jab rasakarshan daab adhik ho jaati he to vah mukhyat: ashuddhiyon ke kaaran hi hoti he
 Measuring pressure is measured with the help of a semipermeable membrane
 vidyudvishleshan ke asmaan vitaran se kuch kalilon main dononsantulan naamak kriya ke kaaran jatilta utpann hoti he
 The study of this balancing act has been studied on dyes, soaps, and many other collicular electrodynamics called Congo Red
 in sthitiyon main kalileey padaarth vidyudvishleshya ke samaan vyavhaar karata he
 When the shape of an ion is similar to the shape of the calculus, when the potential is created on both sides of the dilute, which is called the dilute potential
 kai protein saulon main tanupat-vibhav sadaiv hi utpann ho jaataa he or jivit selon par aavesh is tanupat santulan ke kaaran hi hota he
 The shape or form of the calculus cannot be seen by looking through a microscope
 phir bhi kalilkanon kii sankhya gini ja sakati he; tab vitarit padaarth ke purna aaytan ke maan se ek kan kaa ausat aaytan gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 But when a Saul is made, then many particles of particles are present in it
 kalilkanon kaa rup golakaar, dandakaar, dirghavrittakar yaa paratdaar ho saktaa he
 Several methods have been developed to find the form of Kalilakanas which are based on optical properties
 in kalilon kii visheshta he vitaran madhyam kii shyanta par prabhaav daalana
 Viscosity increases mostly and increases with the increase in volume of the delivered material
 ek vishesh sandran ke pahunchne par shyanta itani bad jaati he ki kalil jelly kaa rup grahan kar letaa he
 Jelly can also be obtained from precipitation of Saul
 jelly kaa upyog simit sa he or gelatin, aighar aighar, starch aadi ke saulon ko sheethal karke jo ardhapardarshak jeliyaan banaai jaati hai unhen hi jelly kii sangya di jaati he
 Most waterfowl cultivars make jelly upon cooling or heating
 kai acarbonic jalasantrasi kalil bhi vishesh paristhitiyon main jelly ke rup main praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 In this way, many aqueous hydroxides, insoluble phosphates, molybdates gels are made in the laboratory

 The Gregorian calendar {gregorian calendar} is a calendar used almost everywhere in the world
 yah julian kaaldarshak kaa roopaantaran he
 It was implemented by Pope Gregory
 isse pehle julian kaaldarshak prachlan main tha, lekin usamen anek trutiyaan thim, jinhen gregory kaaldarshak main dur kar diya gaya
 The main unit of Gregorian calendar is day
 365 dinon kaa ek varsh hota he, kintu har chauthaa varsh 366 din kaa hota he jise adhivarsh kehete hai
 The Sun-based almanac is repeated every 146,097 days
 ise 400 varshon main baanta gaya he or yah 20871 saptaah ke baraabar hota he
 In these 400 years, 303 years are common years, consisting of 365 days
 or 97 lip varsh hote hai, jiname 366 din hote hai
 Thus every year has 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes and 12 seconds
 julian calendar main 365 din 6 ghante kaa varsh mana jaataa tha, parantu aisa maanane se prayek varsh kranti-paatik saura varsh se 11 minute 14 second adhik lete hai
 This excess exceeds 3 days in 400 years
 is bhul par sarvapratham rome ke pope gregory ne sookshmtapurvak vichaar kiya
 He calculated in 1582 AD that at the time of the Dharma Sammelan of Nice city, which took place in the year 325 AD, the aforesaid excess has become 10 days, due to which the date was going back 10 days due to not being taken into account
 
 is vichaar se unhone nepulas ke jyotishi elaay sius liliyas ke paraamarsh se 1582 isvi main 5 oktober ko 15 veen oktober nishchit kiya or tab se yah niyam nikaala ki jo shatabdi varsh 4 se puri tarah vibhajit hone kii bajaay yadi 400 se puri tarah vibhajit ho tabhi use adhivarsh mana jaae anyathaa nahin
 Since this new method was started by Pope Gregory, it was called the Gregorian method or the new method
 is paddati ko bhinn-bhinn isai deshon main bhinn-bhinn varshon main sweekaar kiya gaya
 From this it is necessary to keep this in mind while reading the history of these countries
 is naveen paddati ko italy, france, spain or portugal ne 1582 i0 main, prashia, germany ke roman catholic pradesh switzraland, holland or flanders ne 1583 i0 main, poland ne 1586 i0 main, hungary ne 1587 i0 main, germany or netherland ke protestant pradesh tathaa denmark ne 1700 i0 main, british samrajya ne 1752 i0 main, japan ne 1972 i0 main china ne 1912 i0 main, bulgaria ne 1915 i0 main, turki or soviet rus ne 1917 i0 main tathaa yugoslavia or romania ne 1919 i0 main apanaaya
 After 1582 AD, in 1700 AD till 28 February, the date of the new calendar increased from the old calendar by 10 days
 1600 i0 shatabdi varsh hone se chunki 400 se puri tarah vibhajit hota tha atah vah nayi paddati se bhi adhivarsh hi hota
 Therefore, it did not increase by 1 day to differentiate the date
 taatpary yah ki puraane calendar se naye calendar main taarikh badalte hue unheen shatabdi varshon main purvokt 10 din se ek-ek din kramshah badhaayaa jayega jin shatabdi varshon main 400 se puri tarah bhaag nahin lagata
 That is, after 28 February of 1700 AD, 11 days will be added instead of 10 days to make the date of the new calendar
 isi prakaar 1800 i0 kii 28 farvari ke baad 12 din or 1900 i0 kii 28 farvari ke baad 13 din jode jaayenge
 Again, this increase will be only 13 days due to being completely divided from 400 to 2000 AD, it will not increase by an additional 1 day

 vanshanukramit gun jin dwaara niyantrit hote hai or jeevon ke jinom ke bheetar jin kaa puraa set isaki ginotip kehalaata he
 The complete set of unique traits that make up the structure and behavior of an organism is called a phenotype
 These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment
 natijatan, ek jeev ke phenotype ke kai pahaluon ko viraasat main nahin miltaa he
 For example, there is an interplay between a person's genotype and sunlight; Thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children
 However, due to differences in genotypic variation some people can tan more easily than others; a striking example, are those who are the inherited qualities of bbinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn

 agar kisi vyakti ke bich ek sthaan par diene anukram bhinn hota he, to is anukram ke vibhinn roopon ko elils kaha jaataa he
 DNA sequences can be altered through mutations, creating new alleles
 yadi ek jin ke bheetar ek utparivartan hota he, to nae elil ko prabhavit kar sakate hai ki jin ke niyantran, jeev ke phenotip ko badalte hai
 However, while in some cases this simple correspondence between alleles and a trait, most traits are more complex and quantitative properties are controlled by loci

 If each individual were to contribute the same number of offspring, the sexual population remains the same size as each generation, where the reproductive population doubles in size for each generation
 sex kii do guna laagat pehle jon menard smith dwaara varnit thi
 The first cost is that only one of the two sexes may be young in a sexually mature species
 
 The second cost is that anyone who reproduces sexually can only give 50% of the genes to any different offspring, along with every new generation
 phir bhi eukeriots or bahukoshikeey jeevon ke bich yon prajnan prajnan ke adhik saamaanya saadhan hai

 It may therefore be a source of diversity that is new to the population or a species
 Gene flow may be due to the movement of individuals between different populations of organisms, as the movement of mice or grasses between inland and coastal populations
 k may be due to the movement of pollen between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations

 It is often called the "self-sustaining" mechanism because it is necessary that according to three simple facts: akruti vigyaan, sharir vigyaan or vyavhaar ke sambandh main jeevon kii aabaadi ke bheetar bhinnata maujuud he
 Different traits provide different rates of survival and reproduction
 in lakshanon ko peedi se peedi tak paarit kiya ja saktaa he
 More offspring can be produced than survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction
 natijatan, un gunon ke saath jeevashm jo unhen apane pratidwandviyon par ek laabh de dete hai, unke gunon ko agali peedi tak un gunon ke saath paarit karne kii sambhaavna he jo ek laabh pradaan nahin karte hai
 The main concept of natural selection is the ability to develop an organism
 swasthya ko jivit rahane or punarutpaadan karne kii kshamta ke dwaara mapa jaataa he, jo agali peedi main iske anuvanshik yogadan kaa aakaar nirdhaarit karata he
 However, fitness is not the same as the total number of offspring: fitness is instead indicated by the proportion of later generations that carry the genes of an organism
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi koi jeev acchhee tarah se jivit rah saktaa he or tezi se prajnan kar saktaa he, lekin uske vanshaj bahut chote or jivit rahane ke liye kamjor the, is jeev main bhavishya kii pidiyon main thodaa anuvaanshik yogadan hoga or is prakaar kam fitness hoga
 If alleles increase fitness more than other alleles of that gene, then this allele will become more common within the population with each generation
 in lakshanon ko "ke liye chaynit" kaha jaataa he
 Examples of symptoms that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased fertility
 Conversely, this allele has less beneficial or harmful allyl consequences resulting in reduced fitness - these have been selected against "
 " mahatvapurn baat, elil kii fitness ek nishchit visheshta nahin he; agar paryaavaran main parivartan, pehle tatasth yaa hanikaarak lakshan phydemand ho sakate hai or pehle laabhakaari gun hanikaarak ho jate hai
 However, even if the direction of selection is reversed in this way, symptoms lost in the past may not re-develop into a uniform form
 ek visheshta ke liye aabaadi ke bheetar prakritik chayan, jo vibhinn prakaar ke mulyon jaise oonchai par bhinn ho sakate hai, ko teen alag-alag prakaaron main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he pehla dishaatmak chayan hota he, jo ki samay ke saath ek vishesh gun ke ausat mulya main badlaav hota he- udhaaharan ke liye, jeev dhire-dhire oonche ho jate hai
 Second, disruptive selection is selection for highly trait values and often becomes the most common of the two different values, with selection against the mean value
