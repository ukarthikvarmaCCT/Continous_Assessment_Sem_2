 In the sixth century BC, a caste called Lichchhavi lived in the northern part of Bihar state, ie Vaishali Nagar in Muzaffarpur district
 licch naamak mahapurush ke vanshaj hone ke karan inkaa naam lichhavi padaa athwa kisi prakaar ke chihn dhaaran karne ke kaaran ye is naam se prasiddh hue
 The Lichchavi dynasty is well known in history, whose kingdom was once in Nepal, Magadha and Kaushal
 pracheen sanskrit sahitya main kshatriyon kii is shakha kaa naam 'nichhavi' yaa 'nicchhivi' miltaa he
 The Pali form is 'licchavi'
 manusmriti ke anusaar lichhavi log vratya kshatriya the
 In it they are counted along with Jhal, Malla, Nat, Karan, Khash and Dravid
 ye 'lichhavi' log vaidic dharm ke virdohi the
 Many of their branches were spread far and wide
 vaishaliwali shakha main jain tirthankar mahavir swami hue or koshal kii shakya shakha main gautam buddha pradurbhoot hue
 Once upon a time, this dynasty ruled from Mithila to Magadha and Kosala
 jis prakaar hinduon ke sanskrit granthon main yah vansh hin kaha gaya he, usee prakaar baudhon or jainon ke pali or praakrit granthon me yah vansh ucch kaha gaya he
 King Bimbasar of Magadha, contemporary of Gautama Buddha, had relations with the Lichchhavis of Vaishali
 peeche gupt samrat ne bhi lichhavi kanya se vivaah kiya tha
 The history and history of this caste is found in one form or the other for one thousand years
 pali sahitya main lichhavi vajji sangh kii pradhan jati thi atev angutar nikaay, mahavastu tathaa vinayapitak main shodash mahajanapad kii suchi main vajji kaa hi naam aata he, lichhavi kaa nahin
 Probably this is the reason why Panini has mentioned Vrijjya Sangh
 
 Kautilya has also confirmed this
 vajji sangh kii aath jatiyon main lichhavi ko sabal tathaa sarvashaktisampann jati maanate the jisaki rajdhani baishali kaa ullekh ramayana main bhi aata he
 According to Indian tradition, the Lichchhavis were Kshatriya descendants, which is why the Lichchhavi Sangha after Mahaparinirvana divided the relics of the Buddha
 un logon ne us avshesh par stupa kaa nirmaan kiya tha jo vaishali kii khudaai se prakaash main aayaa he
 Being a region of Buddhism and Jainism, special mention has been made of the Lichchavi caste in Palisakhtya
 ise apaar shaktishaalee tathaa uttam dhang se sangathit sangh kaha gaya he
 The second association of Buddhism also took place in Vaishali
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki lichhavi logon ne bimbsaar ke shasankaal main magadh par chadhaai kii thi 
 The treaty in Magadha and Vaishali states resulted in a matrimonial relationship, but after Bimbasar, Ajatashatru thought to avenge this war
 sansar se virakt rahane par bhi buddha ne ajatshatru ko sachet kiya tha ki lichhavi sangh ajey he, abhedya he tathaa uske prajatantratmak sanghathan ko koi nirbal nahin kar saktaa
 Aware of these words of the Buddha, Ajatashatru gave up the idea of making a direct attack and entrusted the vile task of breaking the Lichchhavi Sangh and making it distinct by creating distinction
 ant main ajaat safal hua 
 In order to invade Vaishali, the city of Pataliputra was established on the south bank of the Ganges, where Magadhasena was organized and the Lichchavi Sangha was defeated due to the schism
 buddha dharmanuai hone ke kaaran lichhavi jati ne shanti tathaa ahimsa kaa samarthan kiya
 Probably under the Magadha Empire, the Lichchavi caste continued to rule over the democratic system for centuries
 isvi san ke aarambh se kushaan kaal main lichhavi sangh ne pun: swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa kar di
 His organization prevailed and Vaishali became the head of state in northern Bihar
 chauthi sadi main gupt vansh kaa udai hone par gupt naresh lichhavi vansh se vaivaahik sambandh ke kaaran shaktishaalee ho gaye
 The emergence of the Gupta empire was made possible with the cooperation of the Lichchhavis
 isaki pushti gupt abhilekhon tathaa swarnamudraon se ho jaati he
 In the golden period of the Gupta period, there is a gold coin known as "chandragupta and Shri Kumar Devi", in the front of which is carved the figure of the king and queen and inscribed "chandragupta" and "sri Kumar Devi"
 prishth bhaag par singh kii peeth par baithi ambika kii murti he
 On the right is read the "lichchavaya:" Mudraksha
 paryaapt vivechan ke pashchaat yah siddh kiya gaya he ki gupt naresh pratham chandragupta ne lichhavi rajkumaari kumaradevi se vivahoparaant yah sikaa nikaala
 This marriage is confirmed by the Prayag pillar inscription of Samudragupta where Samudra is described in the following words: - "sri Maharajadhiraja Chandraguptaasya Lichhavi Dauhitrasya Mahadevayana Kumaradevamutpannasya Maharajadhiraja Sri Samudraguptaasya"
 isse donon rashtron main parsparik sahanubhuti tathaa sahyog rahaa
 Perhaps in the face of the imperialist imagination, the Lichchavi etc
 could not preserve the existence of the kingdom
 prajatantron ke bhartiya rangamanch se hat jane ke kaaran raajnneetik chetana ko navajivan pradaan karanevaala strot samaapt ho gaya
 The Lichchhavi caste migrated from northern Bihar to Nepal in the sixth century
 unhone kathmandu ke surakshit bhubhag main pravesh kar rajya sthapit kiya
 The city of Kathmandu was founded by the Lichchavi king Gunakamdev
 lichhavi jati ke kai abhilekh vahaan mili hai jo is baat ko pramanit karte hai ki is jati ne kai sadiyon tak nepal main shashan kiya
 His reign has been called the "golden Age" in the history of Nepal
 lichchhaviyon ko nepal main thakuri vanshi shaskaon nen haraa kar satta apane adheen main le liya
 The Newar people of Nepal are children of Lichchhaviyans
 lichchhaviyon ke parampara ko abhi tak in logon main jivit he
 On the basis of Dighnikaya it can be said that in Vajjasingha, women were respected and respected by the elderly
 kulkumariyon ke saath balaprayog nahin kiya jaataa tha
 Members of the Sangh obeyed the chaityas, worshiped and performed religious functions properly
 prashasaneey kaaryon ke sampaadan ke liye lichchhavigan kii sabha thi jiske 7707 sadsy the or sab raja kehalaate the
 In the absence of clear evidence, it is difficult to say that all the members of the Sangh Sabha were elected
 lalitvistar main varnan aata he ki lichhavi paraspar ek duusare ko chota bada nahin maanate the, sabhi apane ko raja samajhate the is sambandh main jataka kaa yah kathan bhi mahatvapurn he ki shashan nimitt vaishali nagar ke gana raajaaon kaa abhishek kiya jaataa tha
 Lord Buddha had said in relation to Lichchhavi Gana that all the members were present in the convention in unison
 bina niyam banaae koi ajna preshit nahin karte tathaa purv niyamon ke anusaar kaary karte the
 Among the ancient republics located in Bihar was the largest and powerful kingdom in the Buddha period
 is ganraajya kii sthapana suryavanshiy raja ishvaku ke putr vishaal ne kii thi, jo kaalaantar main ‘vaishali’ ke naam se vikhyath hui
 Itwa Dharahara is a village in Munger, Bihar
 ukhida, berinag tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke pithoragarh jile kaa ek gaanv he
 a torch or bearing is used to handle the parts of a rotating machine
 yah ek aisi yantric yukti he jo mashin ke do yaa adhik bhaagon ke bich kam se kam gharshan ke saath saapeksh gati kii suvidha pradaan karti he
 The part of the spindle or spindle which is placed on the bearing is called a journal
 jarnal, dharuk ke bheetar gumti rahati he or is prakaar ek to dharuk dhuree kaa bhaar or duusare usapar daale hue balon ko sahan karti he tathaa dhuri ko bina kisi rukaawat ke ghoomane kaa avasar detii he
 The simple torrent is similar to a tube in which the axle is inserted
 parantu tej chalanevaali dhuriyon ke liye, yaa jahaan gharshan ke kaaran dharuk tapakar kharaab ho saktaa ho, dharuk ke do paaton main banaaya jaataa he jo vibhinn prakaar ke hote hai
 The torrent of a machine is the part on which the load is kept at all times when the machine is running and due to rotation of the axle, the torrent keeps weeping something
 yadi dharuk ko thik prakaar se na banaaya jaae to bahut jald usko badalanaa padataa he
 Therefore, keeping all the things in mind, the Dharuk has to be made in such a way that at least the worn and worn parts can be replaced with convenience
 dharuk ke do bhaag hote hai, ek bandhani kehalaata he, jo mashin main ksaa jaataa he or is bandhani ke bheetar dharuk ko jamaaya jaataa he, jo pital "gan" dhaatu, yaa kaanse kaa hota he
 Other similar metals are also used in making this part
 isi bhaag ke bheetar dhuree gumti he
 It has been said above that either the torrent is made in one part like a tube, or it is made in two parts in such a way that the two parts become like a tube
 dhuree dharuk ke do paaton pa1 tathaa pa2 ke bich main he
 The lower portion of the torrent is placed in a semicircular space of p 2 bandhani
 is paat ko ghoomane se rokane ke liye prakshep rakhaa jaataa he
 Putting the spindle in this vessel, the plate p 2 is applied over it and tightened by the tip of the cap
 topi t ke upree bhaag main ek chhed chha banaaya jaataa he, jisase tel yaa snehak diya jaataa he
 The oil or lubricant moves through the hole in the grooves inside the axle and when the spindle rotates, the lubricant creates a membrane between the spindle and the torrent, which causes the spindle to rotate only on this membrane of the lubricant
 isliye dharuk kaa ghisaav bahut kam hota he or vah bhi dhuree ke puri raftaar pakadaney se pehle tathaa iske rukne ke samay hi haata he
 If the lubricant is given at the right time, then the dharuk lasts for many days
 aadhunik aakalp ke dharuk duusare dhang se banaae jate hai
 In factories, where the long axles have many torches, it is taken into account by the assumption that the axle alignment can be corrected in the vertical and horizontal direction by the administrative screws
 tej or baari dhuriyon ke dharak ke neeche ke bhaag main tel yaa snehak kaa ek aagaar rahata he
 Some torches have oil-filled palms at the bottom
 ye talp dhuree or dharuk ke bich main rahete hai or talp se ek batti chhed main se hoti hui tel ke kuen main chali jaati he
 Through this light, the oil gets oil all the time
 dharuk ke bich tel bhejne kii do reetiyaan hai, gurutv se yaa dabaav se
 The location of the maximum nipid of the membrane that this oil makes when moving inside the spindle is dependent on the speed of the spindle, the load and the direction of its rotation
 yadi kshaitij dhuree par, jo vamavart disha main gum rahi he bhaar daalaa jaae to mahattam daab kaa centre bich kii khadi rekha ke dahini ore 10 degree se 45 degree tak ke kone par milegaa or yah kone bhaar tathaa gati ke maan par aadhrut hoga
 Due to low speed and high load, the center of maximum pressure will be almost at the bottom of the torrent
 nunatam daab kaa kshetrafal, is dhuree ke liye upree bhaag main khadi rekha ke dahini or hoga
 If the direction of rotation of the axis is changed, the maximum and minimum pressure points will be to the left of the center line standing at the same angle
 jin dharukon main tel aakarshan se jaataa he unke liye tel ko nunatam daab ke sthaan par bheetar janaa chahie
 If there is a load on the main bearings, the oil from the upper part of the holders also works
 jahaan dabaav se tel diya he vahaan tel ke mahattam nipid ke sthaan ke paas se bheetar bhejnaa thik hoga
 This location should be in the same direction as the axis is rotating
 chote dharukon ko chhodkar anya sab dharukon main khaanche banaae jate hai, jisase tel sab sthanon par ek samaan fail jaataa he
 These grooves are not made at the places where the oil is niped, because the grooves at these places will give the oil an opportunity to move to places of low friction and the oil membrane will not be properly formed
 mukhya bering yaa jarnal main khaanche nahin banaae jate, balki dharukon main hi banaae jate hai, parantu tel ke bheetar aane ke sthaan se dhuree ke ghoomane kii disha kii ore janevaala khaanchaa adhik laabhadaayak he
 The friction coefficient, thr, of a given torrent is dependent on the characteristics of the oil
 dharuk kii dhaatu kaa prabhaav gharshan gunank ke upar avashya hota he, yah dhuree ke chalane or tel kii jhilli banane tathaa dhuree ke rukne yaa phir snehak ke gunon par nirbhar hota he
 Suppose a fine oil membrane is formed then the coefficient of conflict is based on oil, heat, speed and load
 gharshan gunank 0
005 yaa 0
002 achche snehak ke liye or 0
05 yaa isse adhik kharaab snehak ke liye hota he
 Without oil holders are also used in places where it is necessary to ensure that the oil spills do not spoil the goods produced by the machine, such as textile making machines
 yadi in mashiinon main telvaale dharuk hon to kapade par tel jarur giregaa, jisase kapadaa kharaab ho jayega
 Hence, these torrents are of different types
 ek dharuk main tel main bhigi hui lakdi lagaai jaati he, duusare main pital ke bhaag main graphit laga diya jaataa he, jiske kaaran gharshan bahut kam ho jaataa he
 Similar and other dharuks are also made, which do not require oil
 kuch aakalpan karanevaalon kaa vichaar he ki dhuree kii shakti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue jarnal kaa vyas kam se kam rakhana chahie, jiske kaaran kam se kam ghisaav ho
 It is also said that if the speed of the spindle is to be kept high then the load on it should also be less
 parantu aadhunik aakalpan karanevaalon main yah sthir kiya he ki yadi dharuk kaa aakalpan thik prakaar se kiya jaae, to gati ke saath saath isapar bhaar bhi zyada daalaa ja saktaa he
 There will be no harm from this
 yah bhi siddh kar diya he ki dharuk kii lambaai kam karne se adhik laabh hota he, visheshkar zyada gati kii dhuree ke liye yah bahut jaruri he
 Less long torrents will not tilt
 iske kaaran dharuk ke bheetar nipid har sthaan par baraabar hoga
 Therefore, by keeping the length of the blade less than its diameter, the speed of the axle can also be increased and the load on the axis can also be increased
 iskaa dhyaan rahe ki yadi dharukon kii lambaai adhik kam ho gai to iske bheetar kaa nipid bad jayega, jiske kaaran dhuree main jakad paidaa ho sakati he or agar lambaai adhik ho gai to dharuk main jhukaav paidaa ho saktaa he
 Therefore, the ratio of length and diameter of the blade should be kept in such a way that neither there is fear of bending nor can it be curved
 isi kaaran yah anupaat pani ke jahaaj kii dhuree ke liye 1 : 1
5, sthapit injanon ke liye 1
2 : 2
5, saral baari dhuree ke liye 2 : 3 or 3 : 4 rakhaa jaataa he
 There are many types of Dharuk
 inamen har ek kaa upyog alag alag he : Rivet Dharuk is made for the vertical axis
 isamen "va" ek bandhani he, jisko mashin main ksaa jaataa he
 This bandhani has a brass torch, in which the axles are attached
 dhuree kaa puraa bhaar dharuk ke aadhaar par rahata he
 It is made semicircular and in this part there is oil or lubricant
 ek pariksha ke fal se yah pataa chalaa he ki yadi is dharuk ke aadhaar main ek khaanchaa banaakar usamen tel bhar diya jaae to dhuree ke chalane par yah tel upar kii ore jaataa he or dhuree ke baraabar se hota hua baahar nikal jaataa he
 If this exhaled oil is sent back in, then this oil can be used again and again and there will never be any oil inside the torrent
 is prakaar kii dhuree par bhaar adhik hone se kilak par adhik daab ho jaaegi, jiske kaaran dharuk vifal ho saktaa he
 Therefore, no more than 15 kg per square centimeter of pressure is applied on this type of torrent
 isse adhik daab hone par galpatt dharuk kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 This type of holders are used in places where there is more load on the axle
 is dharuk kaa pital do bhaagon main hota he, jinamein dhuree ke padon ke anusaar khaanche bane hote hai
 In these grooves the positions of the spindle are seated and this joint is removed in the limb ligament
 is prakaar har ek pad alag alag kaam karata he or dhuree kaa bhaar in padon main bant jaataa he
 These holders are kept cool by water
 yadi yah dharuk thik prakaar thande rakhe jaaen or inamen thik samay par tel bhi diya jaataa rahe to yah adhik chaal or daab sahan kar sakate hai or adhik dinon tak chal sakate hai
 In the torrents described so far, the axis of the spindle rotates at the bottom of the torch and due to the serpentine friction, the metals of both are weakened
 isi gharshan ko kam karne ke liye ghoomanevaale talon ke bich belan yaa goliyon ko baitha diya jaataa he
 Thus, both the floors rotate on the cylinders and the cylinder friction works in place of the serpentine friction, due to which the heating and wear is greatly reduced, but when these holders are worn, they cannot be arranged like other holders , but rather They have to change
 ye dharuk bahut majboot hote hai or kam gharshan ke kaaran inase adhik gati bhi praapt hoti he
 Goli Gharuk is also made like this
 isaki goliyaan donon baajuon ke bich rahati hai
 The only difference is that in Goli Dharuk the load is on the points and the cylinder is on the weight lines in Dharuk
 isliye bhaar itnaa adhik nahin hona chahie ki baajuon par khaanche yaa gadhe pad jaaen

 18 veen sadi main, sainya abhiyantriki ko civil abhiyantriki se alag karne ke liye is shabd kaa prayog kiya jane laga
 John Smitten, who built the Eddystone Lighthouse, described himself as the first civil engineer
 In 1771, Smitten and some of his co-workers formed the Smitten Society of Civil Engineers, a group of pioneers of this business who informally had dinner together
 haalanki kuch pramaan aise bhi hai jo bataate hai ki takneekee baton par vichaar ke liye bhi ye baithken hoti thim lekin aamtaur par ye samooh ek saamaajik samooh kii hi tarah tha
 The Institute of Civil Engineers was established in London in 1818, and in 1820 the eminent engineer Thomas Telford became its first president

 One of the earliest examples of the application of physical and mathematical problems in civil engineering is the work done by Archimedes in the third century BC, including the theory of Archimedes, which tells us the origins of the process of floating or leaping as well as practical
 The solution also states such as Archimedes' Screw
 The Indian mathematician, Brahmagupta, used the 7th century to compute the computation

 Although surveying is a separate business with different qualifications and different licensing arrangements
 civil ejiniyaron ko surveykshan or maanchitran, ke mul or bhugolic soochna pranali main prashikshit kiya jaataa he
 Surveyors determine the location of railwayways, tramway tracks, highways, roads, pipelines, and lanes before they are built, as well as some other infrastructures, such as ports
 bhoomi surveykshan In the United States, the Land Survey of Britain, Canada and most Commonwealth countries is considered a distinct occupation
 bhoomi sangrakshakon ko engeenior nahin mana jaataa he or unka apana vyavsaayik sanghathan or apni licencing aavashyaktaaen hoti hai
 The services of a licensed land are generally required for surveying the range
 nirmaan surveykshan The construction surveyor is usually done by specialized technicians
 bhoomi surveykshakon ke vipareet, isaki parinaam yojana ko sanvaidhanik suvidha praapt nahin he
 The construction surveyor performs the following tasks: parivahan ejineering jan or maal ko kushalpurvak, surakshit or jeevant samaaj ke logon ke liye suchalak ho
 parivahan ejineering kaa sambandh inhen chizon se he
 This task includes - outlining, designing, constructing, maintaining transport infrastructure including roads, canals, highways, rail systems, airports, ports, and mass transit
 This includes transportation design, transportation planning, traffic engineering, urban Some aspects of engineering, line theory,] include areas such as intelligent transportation systems and transportation management shahari ejineering shahari avasanrachana se sambandhit he
 This includes mentioning, designing, manufacturing and maintenance
 This includes road, footpath, water supply network, drainage, management and execution of street light municipal solid waste, storage for many metals for public works and management, maintenance of public parks and cycle paths
 bhumigat upyogita network ke maamle main, yah bijli or doorsanchaar sevaaon ke sthaneey vitaran network ke naagarik bhaag ko bhi jod saktaa he 
 isamen kooda sangrahan or bas seva network kaa anukulan bhi shaamil he
 Some of these disciplines merge with some other civil engineering features, although municipal engineering focuses on these infrastructure networks and services, as they are often built sequentially and are run by the same municipal administration
 sabhi buddha vidyalayon ke granthon ke mutabik, pehali buddha parishad buddha kii mrityu ke turant baad yojit kii gai thi, jisamen haal hi main 400 isa purv ke vidwaanon ke bahumat se dinaankit kiya gaya tha, raja ajathasathru ke sangrakshan ke tahat bhikshu mahakasapa kii adhyakshata main, sattapanni gupha rajgrah main
 Its purpose was to preserve the sayings of the Buddha and the monastic discipline or rule
 sutta ko anand dwaara sunaaya gaya tha, or vinay ko upali dwaara sunaaya gaya tha
 According to the introduction of DN commentary, Abhidhamma Pitaka, or its matika, and ancient commentary were also included
 iske alaava, sangh ne vinay ke sabhi niyamon ko bhi kam or maamuli niyamon ko rakhane kaa sarvasammatipurna nirnay liya
 Some scholars of Indian Buddhism have questioned the historicity of the event, although Sri Lankan and Theravadan sources display a level of internal coherence that suggests otherwise
 praarambhik buddha vidyalayon ke vinaya pitkaa main pehali buddha parishad ke aasapaas kii paristhitiyon ko darj kiya gaya he
 This text is called the text of five hundred hundreds because five hundred senior monks were elected by the community to gather and clarify the teachings of the Buddha
 bhaap tarabine vah yantric yukti he jo daabit bhaap se ooshmiya urja nikaalkar ise yantric kaary main badalati he
 It was invented in 1884 by Sir Charles Parsons in modern form
 bhaap tarabine ek mulchaalak he, jisamen bhaap kii ushma-urja ko gatij urja main parivartit kar, ucch gatisheel bhaap ko ek ghurnak par bandhe hue bahut se falkon par takaraayaa jaataa he, jisase falak paribhraman karte hai evam isse kaary hota he
 In a reciprocating steam engine, the piston is acted upon by the static pressure of the steam
 yadhyapi ingine main bhaap piston ke saath chalati he, phir bhi ingine kii kriya main bhaap kii gatij urja kaa prabhaav naganay he
 Steam turbines can have higher speeds than steam engines and the speed can be larger
 tarabine ke purjon kaa santulan acha rahata he
 The same amount of steam and the same state of steam turbine can produce more power than a steam engine
 bhaap ingine se kuch varsh kaam lene ke baad bhaap kii khapat bad jaati he, parantu tarabine main aisi avasthaa nahin aati prithvi par ke sabhi mul chaalkon main bhaap tarabine sabase adhik tikaoo hota he
 The biggest advantage of a turbine is that it provides the rotor speed directly, while the steam engine has to handle separate materials to achieve rotational speed
 vaashpitra main bhaap kaa janan ucch daab evam adhitaap par hota he
 When this steam approaches the turbine, it has a high amount of heat energy and its pressure is so high that it can circulate to low pressure
 parantu us samay isaki gatij urja naganya hoti he
 Therefore, before steam can do some work, its heat energy is converted into kinetic energy
 yah parivartan, acchhee tarah abhikalpit upkaran main, bhaap ko vistaarit karne se hota he
 The diffusion of steam is accomplished either in a single action, or in different actions
 iskaa arth yah hota he ki ushma urja ko gatij urja main parivartit karne ke liye bahut se sthir upkaran vyavhaar main laae jate hai or praaia: do sthir upkarnon ke bich ek gatiman upkaran laga rahata he
 The kinetic energy received in the stationary device is then applied to work on the bonded moving device
 vishwa kaa sarvapratham ghurnan ingine san 50 i
 main ailexandria ke hero ne banaaya tha
 It contained a hollow ball between two nails
 tarabine ke nichle bhaag main bhaap banane ke liye baratan rakhaa hua tha, jisase bhaap us gend main pravesh kar sakati thi
 From there the steam came out through two triangular tubes fitted in the ball, due to which the ball kept moving
 yah tarabine bahut hi saadhaaran tha
 Based on the Hero's turbine, a number of scientists undertook explorations for its development
 tab se vibhinn abhikalp ke tarabine banaae gaye, kintu ve sabhi namoonay ke rup main hi rahe
 To implement those turbines was not considered profitable
 sarvapratham safal tarabine giovanni vranka ne 1629 i
 main banaaya tha
 This was the first impulse turbine
 bhaap tarabine mukhyat: do prakaar ke hote hai: In this turbine, steam is transmitted only to the tund
 gatiman falkon se hokar guzarane main bhaap kii daab main kuch bhi parivartan nahin hota, arthath falkon ke pravesh or nikaas sire par bhaap kii daab samaan hi rahati he
 Steam flows through several rows of moving panels, and the kinetic energy changes as a useful function in this flow
 is tarah ke tarabinon main pratham safal tarabine di labal kaa tarabine tha yah ek aavegchakra he, jiske upar paridhi par lage hue tundon se bhaap nikalakar takaraati he
 The steam is fully expanded in the pool
 ye tund chakra kii sparsharekha se 150 se 200 tak ke kone par jhuke rahete hai
 The smallest de Laval turbine was built of a 5-inch diameter circle and was run at 30,000 revolutions per minute
 yah nimna daab bhaap ke liye upyukt he
 The entry and exit angles of such turbine panels are the same
 is prakaar ke tarabine main bhaap kaa purna rup se prasar ek kriya main nahin hota
 Steam coming out of the first stationary line hits the moving pane
 jaise jaise bhaap falkon se hokar pravaahit hoti he, vaise vaise iskaa prasar hota jaataa he
 Therefore, in this type of turbine, the plank also acts as a tank
 gatiman falkon dwaara bhaap ke prasaarit kiye jane par bhaap kii gatij urja main kuch vruddhi ho jaati he
 In this way its panes function as well as circulate steam
 in falkon ko saath hi saath prerit evam pratikriya balon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 That is why such turbine is called 'impulse response turbine'
 vastut: yah namakaran ashuddh he, kyonki keval shuddh pratikriya tarabine naam kaa koi bhi tarabine nahin hota
 There are two main examples of such turbines: - 1884 i
 main parson ne pratham aaveg pratikraya tarabine banaaya tha
 In this, steam flows through the vane in a direction parallel to the axis of the turbine cycle
 is tarah ke tarabine ko akshapravaah tarabine bhi kehete hai
 Pans located in parson turbines are made all in motion
 is tarabine main falak traigy disha main lage rahete hai, jisase bhaap chakra ke aksh ke nikat falak ke sire par pravesh karti he or paridhi kii ore pravaahit hoti he
 Due to this the flow in this turbine is radius
 iske sivaay isamen ek mahatvapurn antar yah he ki donon tarah ke falak vipareet dishaao main chalate hai, jisase ucch aapekshik veg praapt hota he
 Generally, following parts are fitted in steam turbine: bhaap tarabine main sabase mukhya iske falak hai
 Other parts of this device remain for the use of these panels
 bina falak ke shakti praapt nahin ho sakati evam falkon main jaraa sa bhi dosha rahane se tarabine kii dakshata main kami aa jaati he
 For its manufacture, such materials are needed which can withstand high stress as well as high stress
 aadhunik ucch taap or ucch pratibal vaale tarabinon ke falkon ke liye aloh varg ke dravyon kaa vyavhaar nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki taap ke saath inaki tanaav kshamta main bhi kami aa jaati he
 Nowadays, the focus of scientists towards the development of non-renewable steel
 adarsh falak vahi he jo ucchtam dakshata kaa hote hue ek samaan pratibalit ho
 Such a state can be achieved by hollow faces
 iske sivaay khokhale falak paribhramak par teevr pratibal nahin daalate
 This results in higher speed, and more power can be achieved
 tarabine main pravan falkon kaa bhi vyavhaar kiya jaataa he, jisase iske upar kam pratibal pade
 In all steam turbines, the flux is proportional to steam acceleration
 yadi bhaap ko vaashpitra daab se sanghanak daab tak ek hi charan main prasaarit kiya jaay, to prasar ke ant main bhapagati atyadhik ho jaaegi
 If this high speed steam is treated in a plank, it will give the cruising speed extremely high, which is too much for practical purposes
 paribhramak kii is ucch gati ko kam karne ke liye bahut si pranaliyaan khoji garh hai
 All of these systems use a number of truncates
 iske liye ek hi isha par bahut se paribhramak ek kram chaabi kii sahaayta se bandhe rahete hai
 As the steam flows through the moving pins, the steam is absorbed in those phases
 is kriya ko 'sangyojan' kehete hai
 The main ways of reducing the cruiser speed are: sthir falkon kii panktiyon dwaara pruthak kii hui, gatiman falkon kii panktiyaan tarabine ish par bandhi rahati hai
 The steam propagates from the evaporator pressure to the condensate pressure into the bottleneck, achieving higher speeds
 iske baad ucch-gati-bhaap gatiman falkon kii pratham pankti dwaara pravaahit hoti he, jisamen isaki gati kaa kuch bhaag avashoshit hota he or baaki sthir falkon kii agali pankti main pravesh karata he
 These change the direction of steam without changing the steady vane speed
 tab bhaap gatiman falak kii duusari pankti main pravesh karti he
 Some other part of the speed of steam is absorbed in this second speed line
 jyon jyon bhaap aage kii phalkapanktiyon dwaara pravaahit hoti he, is kram kii punrariti hoti rahati he
 In this way the entire kinetic energy of steam is absorbed
 isamen gatiman falkon kii panktiyaan, jinamein prayek ke baad sthir tonti kii ek pankti hoti he, kram main tarabine isha par chaabi dwaara lagi rahati he
 In this, the full pressure of the steam is not only in the first row of the cable spout, but it is equally divided in all the rows of the spout
 vaashpitra se bhaap tonti kii pratham pankti main pravesh karti he, jisamen yah anshat: prasaarit hoti he
 It then flows through the first moving pane, where almost all of its kinetic energy is absorbed
 is pankti se nikalakar yah tonti kii duusari pankti main pravesh karti he, jahaan yah pun: anshat: prasaarit hoti he
 This causes some decrease in pressure again
 toti kii duusari pankti dwaara praapt gatij urja agali gatiman phalkapankti main avashoshit hoti he
 This action continues until the entire pressure is absorbed into the turbine
 daab sangyojan kaa yah tarika ratu evam joyali tarabine main vyavhaar main laayaa jaataa he
 Such a turbine uses both of the above methods
 bhaap kaa purna daabpaat sabhi charnon main vibhakt kiya jaat he or prayek charan main praapt gati ko bhi sanyojit kar diya jaataa he
 This has the advantage that high pressure is attained in each phase, as a result of which fewer steps are required
 isiilie is tarah ke tarabine kaa aakaar chota hota he
 The Curtis turbine is similar to this
 tarabine ke gatiman falak ke pravesh evam nikaas sire par bhaap kii vibhinn gatiyon ko veg aarekh dwaara pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 In an ideal turbine, the work done by steam is equal to the Rankine work, that is, it will be equal to the thermodynamic heat
 vyavhaar main honevaali anek haniyon dwaara yah kaary atyant kam ho jaataa he
 The first loss occurs in the veg valve, where steam pressure is reduced from 5 to 10 percent by intercept
 ucch-daab-tonti-peti main gharshan evam bhanvar dwaara bhaap kii daab main phir kuch kami ho jaati he, kintu sabase adhik haani tonti main hoti hai
 Small panels are not suitable for thermal efficiency, but if the height of the pane is increased, the high pressure steam does not cover the entire circumference of the first stage due to the greater condensation and finite volume of steam, leading to partial penetration
 iskaa parinaam yah hota he ki jo falak bhaap ke jet ke prabhaav ke andar nahin hote, ve aavaran main bhari hui bhaap kaa manthan karte rahete hai
 Due to this, there is loss of fan or wind
 ucchdaab tarabine kaa paribhramak bhi swayan ghaney madhyam main chalata he, jisamen ise atyant taral avrodh kaa saamana karnaa padataa he evam iske kaaran chakti-gharshan-haani hoti he
 These losses of steam flowing through different stages in the turbine are always encountered
 jyon-jyon bhaap kii ghanata main kami hoti jaati he, tyon tyon ye haniyaan bhi kam hoti jaati hai
 Apart from these, there is also radiation loss
 vering main gharshan dwaara bhi haniyaan hoti hai
 After working in the turbine, steam enters the condenser and at this time it also has some velocity
 is gatij urja kii haani ko antim yaa avshisht haani kehete hai
 This system is used to increase the efficiency of the turbine plant
 isamen bhaap a, ba or sa teen binduon se tarabine se nikaalkar teen taapakon main bheji jaati he
 Steam from the final heater enters the reservoir in a humid state, through which the runoff flows
 chunki bharnajal bhaap se adhik thanda rahata he, at: yah bhaap se garmi lekar swayan garam ho jaataa he
 The fill water goes from one heater to another, then from the second to the third
 antim taapak se nikalakar bharnajal atyant garam ho jaataa he, jisase vaashpitra main taap kii bachat hoti he
 This increases the efficiency of the turbine plant
 tarabine main prasaarit hote samay bhaap pratham kuch charnon ke baad ardra ho jaati he
 Hydrographs in humid steam strike the panels, reducing the lifespan of the panels
 at: falak sanksharan ko hataane, bhaap kii gharshan haani ko kam karne evam tarabine kii ushmiya kshamta ko badhaane ke liye bhaap ko ardra hote hi tarabine se nikaal liya jaataa he
 It then enters the reheat, where it is again overpowered by heating and then returns to the next stage of the turbine
 pun: taapan ke liye bhaap abhikalp ke anusaar, tarabine ke ek yaa adhik sthanon se baahar nikaali jaati he
 These are - bahut se udyogon main shakti ke saath hi saath ushma kii bhi maang hoti he, jo vidhayan kaary ke liye aavashyak hoti he
 Since the absolute heat of saturated steam at 300 pounds per square inch is only four percent higher than the absolute heat at 30 pounds per square inch, the generation of high pressure steam would be more advantageous thermodynamically
 nishkarshan tarabine main is bhaap ko pehle kaary karne ke liye prasaarit kiya jaataa he evam maang ke anusaar bhaap kii kuch maatra ko nimna daab par vidhayan kaary ke liye baahar nikaal liya jaataa he
 The remaining portion is transmitted to the condensate pressure in the turbine
 is tarah ke tarabine ko nishkarshan tarabine kehete hai evam is tarabine ke do bhaag, ucchdaab bhaag or nimnadaab bhaag, hote hai
 This turbine is a form of extraction turbine
 isamen vidhayan kaary ke liye sampurna bhaap ko baahar nikaal liya jaataa he
 This allows steam to circulate only in the high pressure part
 nimnadaab tarabine vah tarabine he jisamen bhaap kaary karne ke liye nimna daab par pravesh karti he or nimnatam daab tak prasaarit hoti he
 If the low pressure steam continues continuously, the capacity of the entire plant can be increased by using a low pressure turbine
 ushmagatiki ke siddhant ke anusaar samaan dabaseemaa par kaary karanevaale nimnadaab tarabine main nimnadaab ingine kii apeksha adhik kaary praapt hota he
 If steam supply is not continuous, the thermometer is treated
 upar bataae gaye ushmasanchayak kii kshamta bhi simit hoti he
 When the amount of low-pressure steam is greatly reduced by demand, the steam pressure from the evaporator is lowered and sent to the turbine to meet this shortfall
 is tarah ucchdaab or nimnadaab par aanevalani bhaap ke do pradaay ek hi tarabine main aate hai
 This type of turbine is called mixed pressure turbine
 is tarabine main bhaap ingine dwaara nimnadababhaap-nikaas, yaa ushmasanchayak, kaa vyavhaar kiya jaataa he

 Mihirbhoj is considered the greatest king of the Gurjara Pratihara dynasty
 inhone lagbhag 50 saal tak rajya kiya tha
 Their empire was very vast and under it came the Thetras which are the states of modern India, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Odisha, Gujarat, Himachal etc
 mihir bhoj vishnu bhagwaan ke bhakt the tathaa kuch sikkon me inhe 'adivarah' bhi mana gaya he
 a place called Mehroli was named after him
 rashtareey rajmarg 24 kaa kuch bhaag gurjar samraat mihirbhoj maarg naam se janaa jaataa he
 Emperor Mihir Bhoja ruled for 49 years from 836 AD to 885 AD
 mihir bhoj ke samrajya kaa vistaar aaj ke multan se pashchim bengal tak or kashmir se karnataka tak phela hua tha
 He was an ardent devotee of the protector Emperor Shiva
 skandh puraana ke prabhas khand main samraat mihir bhoj ke jivan ke bare main vivaran miltaa he
 After ruling for 50 years, he handed over the throne to his son Mahendra Pal and went to the forest for retirement
 arab yatri suleman ne bharat bhraman ke dauraan likhi pustak silsiliut tuaarikh 851 isvin main samraat mihir bhoj ko islam kaa sabase bada shatru bataaya he, saath hi mihir bhoj kii mahaan sena kii tarif bhi kii he, saath hi mihir bhoj ke rajya kii simaaen dakshin main rajkuton ke rajya, purv main bengal ke paal shaasha or pashchim main multan ke shaskaon kii simaaon ko chooti hui bataayi he
 Baghdad historian al-masoodi, who came to India in 915 AD, has also written about the mighty army of 36 lakh soldiers of Mihir Bhoja in his book Maruzul Mahan
 inaki rajshahi kaa nishaan “varah” tha or muslim akramanakariyon ke man main itani bhay thi ki ve varah yani boar se nafrat karte the
 People of all classes and castes in Mihir Bhoja's army took up arms to fight the nation and fought the Islamic invaders
 samraat mihir bhoj ke mitra kabul kaa laliya shahi raja kashmir kaa utpal vanshi raja avanti varman tathaa nepal kaa raja raghavdev or assam ke raja the
 Emperor Mihir Bhoja at that time was the enemy, Palavanshi king Devpal, the nation of the south, Katu Maharaj Amodhavarsha and the Khalifa of Arabia, Matsim Sim Wasik, Mutvakkal, Muntashir, Mautamidadi
 arab ke khalipha ne imran bin musa ko sindh ke us ilaake par shaasha niyukt kiya tha
 Which had the right of the Arabs
 samraat mihir bhoj ne bengal ke raja devpal ke putr narayanalal ko yuddh main parrast karke uttari bengal ko apane samrajya main sammilit kar liya tha
 The king of the south defeated the king Amodhavarsha and merged his territory with his empire
 sindh ke arab shaasha imran bin musa ko puri tarah parajeet karke samast sindh gurjar pratihaar samrajya kaa abhinn ang bana liya tha
 Only Mansura and Multan stayed in Sindh near the two Arabs because the Arabs had built caves called Anmahfuz in order to escape the stormy fierce attacks of the Gurjara Pratihara emperor in which Arabs hid their lives
 samraat mihir bhoj nahi chaahate the ki arab in do sthanon par bhi surakshit rahen or aage sankat kaa kaaran bane isliye usne kai bade sainik abhiyaan bhej kar imran bin musa ke anamhafooj naamak jagah ko jeet kar gurjar pratihaar samrajya kii pashchimi simaaen sindh nadi se sainkadon mile pashchim tak panhucha di or isi prakaar bharat desh ko agali shatabdiyon tak arabon ke barbar, dharmandh tathaa atyaachaari akramanon se surakshit kar diya tha
 In this way, the boundaries of the kingdom of Emperor Mihir Bhoj from Kabul to Ranchi and Assam, from the Himalayas to the Narmada River and Andhra, from Kathiawar to Bengal, were strong and secure
 arab yatri suleman or masudi ne apane yatra vivaran main likhaa he ’jinka naam barah he
 There is no fear of a thief in his kingdom
 uski rajdhani kannauj bharat kaa pramukh nagar he jisamen 7 kile or das hajaar mandir he
 Adi is considered an incarnation of Barah
 yah islam dharm or arabon kaa sabase bada shatru he
 Mihir Bhoja spent fifty years of his life engaged in wars on horseback in the battlefield
 uski chaar sena thi unamem se ek sena kanakapaal parmaar ke netritv main gadhwal nepal ke raghavdev kii tibet ke akramanon se raksha karti thi
 Similarly, an army under the leadership of Alkan Dev was stationed near the present Gujraj city of Punjab, which protected the Lalia Shahi kings of Kabul from invasions on behalf of Turkistan
 isaki pashchim kii sena multan ke musalmaan shaasha par niyantran karti thi
 The army of the south fought the battle of the king of Balhara and the other two forces in two directions
 samraat mihir bhej in chaaron senaaon kaa sanchaalan, maargdarshan tathaa niyantran swayan karata tha
 Like his ancestor Gurjara Pratihara Emperor Nagabhat I, Emperor Mihir Bhoja, like his ancestors, raised a standing army which was necessary to compete with the Arab invaders! If other emperors after Nagabhatta had not kept a permanent, trained and skilled and patriotic army, then the history of India would have been different and nothing called Indian culture and civilization would have survived
 jab arab senaayen sindh praant par adhikaar karne va usko muslim raashtra main parivartit karne ke baad samast bharat ko muslim raashtra banane ke liye senapati mohammad juned ke netritv main aage badi, to unhen sindh se mili gurjar pradesh ko jeetna jaruri tha
 So they started terrible attacks
 ek taraf arab, syria va iraq aadi ke islamic sainik the, jinka makasad puri duniya main islamic hukumat kaayam karnaa tha or duusari taraf mahaan arya-dharm va samskruti ke pratik gurjar ! arabi dharmaandh yoddha ’allaah hoon akbar” ke udghosh ke saath yuddh main aate to mihir bhoj kii sena jai mahadev jai gurjeshwar, jai mahakaal kii lalkaar ke saath takkar lene or kaatane ko teyar thi
 The Hindu warriors considered the attack on the sleeping soldiers in the night against religion, but the Muslim invader would attack at any time during the night, such terrible wars continued in Arabs and Gurjaro
 kabhi rankshetra main bhinmaal, kabhi hakadaa nadi kaa kinaaraa, kabhi bhadauch va vallabhi nagar tak arabon ke prahaar ho jate the
 Some cities were damaged and some cities were destroyed
 jan dhan kii baari haani gurjaro ko yuddh main uthaani padi jinka prabhaav agle yudhon par padaa
 For twelve years, many famous cities like Bhinmal etc
 were badly destroyed and many dynasties were destroyed and the condition of many was greatly deteriorated, but the brave heroes of Arya religion and culture did not lose courage
 kashmir kaa samraat shankar varman mihir bhoj kaa mitra tha
 At the time of Mihir Bhoja, the Arabs tried hard to increase their power in India, but the brave Hindu emperor drove the Arabs out of Kutch where they started moving
 is vir samraat ne apane baahubal se khalipha kaa adhikaar sindh se bhi hataa liya
 Mihir Bhoja's official, Alakhan Kabul, continued to help King Lalip of Hindushahi dynasty against the invasions of the Arabs, because Kabul Kandhar was part of India at that time
 ab rashtriya rajmarg 24 jo dilli se lakhanu ko jodta he kaa naam bhi dilli sarkaar ne gurjar samraat mihir bhoj ke naam par rakhaa he or dilli main nizamuddin pul he jahaan se yah rajmarg shuru hota he
 There the Delhi government has put a big stone on which the Gurjar Samrat Mihir Bhoj National Highway is written
 isi rajmarg par sthit swami narayan sampradaay kaa akshardham mandir he
 Bharat Bhagwan located in the Akshardham temple has a statue of the metal of Gurjar Emperor Mihir Bhoj Mahan and is written on it, Maharaja Gurjar Emperor Mihir Bhoj Mahan

 There are two stories behind the establishment of Bikaner
 pehali to yah ki, napa saankhla ne, jo bikaaji ke mamaa the, jodhaji se kaha –“aapane bhale hi santal ji ko jodhpur kaa uttaradhikari bana diya he, kintu bikaaji ko kuch sainik or sarunde kaa patta de dijiye
 He is brave and also rich in luck, he will establish his own kingdom on his own with your blessing
 ’ jodhaji ne napa kii salaah maan lee or 500 sainikon kii tukdi sahit sarunde kaa patta napaji ko de diya
 The mighty Bikaji accepted the father's decision happily
 us samay kandhal ji, roopa ji, mandal ji, natthu ji or nanda ji- ye paanch sardaar ke alaava napa saankhla, bela padihar, lala lakhan singh baid, chouthmal kothaari, nahar singh bachhavat, vikram singh purohit, saaluji rathi aadi logon ne bikaaji kaa saath diya
 With all these chiefs, Bikaji founded Bikaner
 saalu ji rathi jodhpur ke osinyaan gaanv ke nivasee the
 They also brought with them the idol of their Lord Adhunadeva Marunayak or Moolnayak, in whose honor even today their descendants perform Holika Dahan in the 'saale Ki Holi' locality
 saale kaa asal arth bahan ke bhai ke rup main na hokar saalu ji ke apbhransh ke rup main liya janaa chahie! Another popular public opinion behind the establishment of Bikaner is that one day the King of Jodhpur, Rao Rao, was sitting in the Jodhpur court, then Bikaji came for a while and bowed and started whispering to his uncle Kanthal
 Seeing this, Rao Jodha said in sarcasm "it seems that both the uncles and nephews are planning to establish a new state
 “ is par bika or kanthal ne kaha ki "yadi maharaj sahab ! aap kii krupa hui to jaldi hi aisa hi hoga” or ye kehane ke saath hi saath chachaa– bhatija donon rajdurbar se uth ke chale aaye | Together these two established the new Bikaner state

Rao Bika fought the Bhatis for ten years, but did not see victory, and came to Bikaner in the year 1442
 He established the city of Bikaner in 1488 AD and made it his capital

 Bangladesh's freedom struggle took place in 1971, it is also called 'freedom struggle'
 yah yuddh varsh 1971 main 25 march se 16 disambar tak chalaa tha
 Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan through this bloody war
 16 disambar san 1971 ko bangladesh bana tha
 This historic victory of India over Pakistan is celebrated as Victory Day
 pakistan par yah jeet kai myanon main aitihaasik thi
 India forced 93,000 Pakistani soldiers to kneel
 1971 ke pehle bangladesh, pakistan kaa ek praant tha jiskaa naam 'purvi pakistan' tha jabaki vartmaan pakistan ko pashchimi pakistan kehete the
 The people of East Pakistan took to the streets in protest against many years of struggle and atrocities of the Pakistan Army and suppression of the Bangladeshi
 1971 main azaadi ke andolan ko kuchalane ke liye pakistani sena ne purvi pakistan ke vidroh par amada logon par jamkar atyaachaar kiye
 Millions of people were killed and countless women were looted
 bharat ne padosi ke naate is julm kaa virodh kiya or krantikariyon kii madad kii
 As a result, there was a direct war between India and Pakistan
 is ladaai main bharat ne pakistan ko ghutane techne par majaboor kar die
 With this, a new country emerged in South Asia
 14 agast 1947 ko dharm par aadhaarit swatantra pakistan desh kaa gathan hua, tatkaaleen pakistan ke do bhaag the purvi evam pashchimi pakistan evam dono hi bhaag me saamaajik, aarthik evam shaikshnik samanthaayen nahi thim| sansadhano ke anusaar purvi pakistan zyada samrudh tha lekin raajnneetik rup se pashchimi pakistan zyada prakhar evam haaavee tha
 Thus the social and economic disparities found in two parts of the same country and the tendency of enlightened people to control the power itself led to nationwide dissatisfaction and finally the formation of Bangladesh in 1971
 pakistan ke gathan ke samay pashchimi kshetra main sindhi, pathan, baloch or mujahiron kii badi sankhya thi, jabaki purv hisse main bengali bolne waalon kaa bahumat tha
 Although there was never a lack of political consciousness in the eastern part, but the eastern part could never get proper representation in the power of the country and always remained politically neglected
 isse purvi pakistan ke logon main jabardast naaraazgi thi
 And to take political advantage of this resentment, Bangladesh leader Sheikh mujib-ur-rehman formed Awami League and demanded more autonomy within Pakistan
 1970 main hue aam chunaav main purvi kshetra main shaikh kii party ne jabardast vijay hasil kii
 His party also won a majority in Parliament but instead of making him Prime Minister, he was put in jail
 or yaheen se pakistan ke vibhaajan kii neenv rakhi gai
 General Yahya Khan was President in Pakistan at the time of 1971 and he gave responsibility to General Tikka Khan to remove the resentment spreading in the eastern part
 lekin unke dwaara dabaav se maamle ko hal karne ke prayaas kiye gayi jisase sthiti puri tarah bighad gai
 On 25 March 1971, there was a massive massacre in this part of Pakistan under the leadership of the army and police
 isse pakistani sena main kaam kar rahe purvi kshetra ke nivaasiyon main jabardast rosh hua or unhone alag mukti vahini bana lee
 The Pakistani military continued to persecute innocent, weaponless people
 jisase logon kaa palaayan aarambh ho gaya jiske kaaran bharat ne antarrashtriya samudaay se lagaataar apil kii ki purvi pakistan kii sthiti sudhari jaae, lekin kisi desh ne dhyaan nahin diya or jab vahaan ke visthapit lagaataar bharat aate rahe to april 1971 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne mukti vahini ko samarthan dekar, bangladesh ko aaazaad karwaane kaa nirnay liya
 Before becoming Bangladesh, the Pakistani military in East Pakistan violated human rights with the help of local leaders and religious extremists
 25 march 1971 ko shuru hue oparation search lite se lekar puure bangladesh kii azaadi kii ladaai ke dauraan purvi pakistan main jamkar hinsa hui
 According to the Bangladesh government, around 3 million people died during this period
 haalanki, pakistan sarkaar kii ore se gathit kiye gaye hamudur rahamaan ayog ne is dauraan sirf 26 hajaar aam logon kii maut kaa nateeja nikaala
 At the behest of the Pakistan Army, the Razakars, Al Shams and Al Badr tortured Bengali-speaking minorities and Bengali-speaking Muslims in erstwhile East Pakistan and fiercely violated human rights
 unke dwaara kiye gayi amanviya atyaachaar ke pramaan aaj tak bangladesh me samuhik kabron ke rup me milte rahe hai | After the massacres in erstwhile East Pakistan in 1971, several mass graves have been built, which have been known till date
 1999 main dhaka main masjid ke paas ek vishaal kabr kaa pataa chalaa
 The atrocities against the Bengalis can be traced to a telegram sent from the US Consulate in Dhaka
 is telegram ke mutabik bengaaliyon ke khilaaf yuddh kii pehali hi raat ko dhaka uniwarsity main chaatro or aam logon ko saream maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 Massacres were carried out in all the areas from where opposition was feared
 Even people were taken out of the houses and fryed with bullets
 1971 main purvi pakistan main lakhon mahilaon ke saath balaatkaar, atyaachaar kiya gaya or hatya kii gayi
 According to an estimate, such excesses were made with about four lakh such women, who committed acts of forced sexual relations with them, women in military cant as sex workers etc
 and acts like gang rape
 563 bengali mahilaon ko kaint ilaake main kar rakhaa tha kaidaladai ke pehle hi din se 563 bengali mahilaon ko dhaka ke dingi military kaint main kaid kar diya gaya tha
 Pakistani army soldiers used to commit excesses with these women
 atyacharon se pareshaan hokar ke lagbhag10 lakh log bharat chale gaye ek duusare anumaan ke mutabik purvi pakistan main atyaachaar se tang aakar kareeb 80 lakh log bharat kii seemaa main pravesh kar gaye the
 The entry of these refugees into India and the economic pressure on India due to this weight is also considered to be a reason behind interfering in this battle of India
 bangladesh kii azaadi kii ladaai ke dauraan mukti vahini kaa gathan pakistan sena ke atyaachaar ke virodh main kiya gaya tha
 In 1969, discontent grew in East Pakistan against Pakistan's then military ruler General Ayub and was at its peak in 1970 during the movement of Bangladesh's founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman
 mukti vahini ek chhapamar sanghathan tha, jo pakistani sena ke khilaaf gorilla yuddh lard rahaa tha
 Mukti Vahini was supported by the Indian Army

 hindi main aiyaari or tilsmi upanyaason ke janak devaki nandan khatri jab chandrakanta ke saath hindi main prakat hue to praayah usee kaal main ambika dutt vyas virachit aashcharya-vrittant ne bhi hindi main vigyaan galp lekhan kii nayi sarani nirmit kii
 It was published serially in the magazine 'peus Pravah' between 1884-88
 ‘aashcharyavrittant’ vishuddh rup se vigyaan galp tha jo tilsmi or jasusi prabhaavon se sarvatha unmukt tha
 On the other hand, in the Bengali language "panch Kauri De", when detective literature - 'incident-umbrella', 'jai-parajaya', 'jeevan Rahasya', 'neel Vasna Sundari', 'mayavi', '- were trending in the same period
 Science fiction was also being written in it, rather it should be said that the science fiction in Bangla had preceded it
 paudhon main jivan ke vishleshak or betaar ke avishkaarak acharya jagadish chandra bose ne ‘tufaan par vijay’ sheershak se pratham bangla vigyaan galp 1897 main hi likhaa tha
 Anadidhan Bannerji presented novels like 'van Kusum', 'champa Phool', 'chor' as well as science fiction like 'mars'
 marathi main shridhar baalkrishna ranade ne pehali vigyaan katha ‘tareche hasya’ sheershak se 1915 main likhi thi

 devaki nandan khatri ne mirzapur ke aranyon kii prishthbhumi main jo andrajalik sansar rachaa, usase hindi pathak vismit or vimudh rah gaya or usne khatri ji ko haathon haath liya
 Khanni Praneet 'narendramohini' 'virendra Veer', 'chandrakanta Santi', 'kusum Kumari', 'naulakha Haar', 'guptagodna'
 The 'paper closet', the unique Begum, 'bhootnath' crossed all limits of popularity
 devaki nandan khatri ke indrajaal kaa jaadu pathakon ke sir par chadhakar bolne laga
 Acharya Ramchandra Shukla has written in 'history of Hindi Literature' that Urdu speakers learned Hindi to enjoy Khatri's Tilasmi literature
 to aisa tha khatri kaa andrajalik sansar ! What is the reader, even contemporary writers could not live without being enthralled by this magic
 phir tilsmi sahitya rachane ke sarthak prayaas aarambh hue or prabhoot maatra main aisi chijen saamne aane lageen or hindi pathak usamen sarabor ho gaya
 The rich tradition of such writers is seen in this period
 devi prasad upaadhyaay krit ‘maaya-vilaas’, jagannatha chaturvedi krit ‘vasant-malti’, hare krishna johar krit ‘kusum lata’, ‘bhayanak prem’, saraswati gupta krit ‘rajkumaar’, bal mukund verma krit ‘kamini’, rajendra mohini, hare krishna johar krit ‘nari-pishaach’, ‘manyak-mohini’, ‘jaadugar’ tathaa ‘camel kumari’, madan mohan pathak krit ‘anand sundari’, munni laal khanni krit ‘sachcha bahadur’, hare krishna johar krit ‘niraala nakaabposh’ tathaa ‘bhayanak khun’, kishori laal goswami krit ‘kate mud kii do-do baaten’, vishweshwar prasad verma krit, ‘virendra kumaar’, kishori laal goswami krit ‘yakuti takhti’, ram laal verma krit ‘putalimahal’, rup kishor jain krit ‘surya kumaar sambhav’ aadi isi sahitya kii pratinidh rachanaaen hai
 This tradition continued in the future, but it is from here that tilasmi literature should often be considered as an end
 yah bhi ek vicitra sanyog he ki tilsmi sahitya ke saath-saath jasusi kii bhi achaanak baadh aa gayi or bhi pathakon ne saraahaa or apanaaya
 The detective novels in Hindi are Preeta Gopal Ram Gahmari
 devaki nandan khatri kii ‘chandrakanta’ or ‘narendra mohini’ ke thode samyantaral baad ‘adbhut laash’ or ‘guptchar’ ke saath gahamri bhi udit hue
 Inspired by the growing popularity of these detective novels, Gahmari created such a plethora of literature - 'baekasoor ki hanga', 'sarkati corpse', 'who is the murderer?', 'blood of innocent', 'blood of Jamuna', 'double 'spies', 'mayawini', 'sorceress Manorama' 1901), 'girl Chori', 'spy Ki Bhool', 'police Station's theft', 'robbery theft', 'blind eye', 'trap King', 'fake Kaka' , 'detective Theft,' 'theft in Warehouse', 'robbery on Robbery', 'doctor's Story', 'piercing the House', 'detective Detective ',' Devi Singh '
 'boy missing', 'detective Chakkar', 'killer's distinction', 'bhojpur's thief'
 'balihari wisdom', 'yoga glory' and 'guptabhed' etc
 jasusi sahitya ke prabhaav se samakaleen hindi lekhak bhi apane ko virat na rakh sake or isi avadhi main aisi anekanek rachanaaen saamne ai
 Rudra Dutt Sharma as' Var Singh Daroga ',' Kishori Lal Goswami ',' Jinde Ki Corpse ',' Jairam Gupta ',' Lame Killer ', Jung Bahadur Singh,' Odd Blood ', Sher Singh's' Fantastic Detective', 'chandrasekhar Pathak Krit 'amir Ali Thang', 'shashi Bala' and Shiva Narayan Dwivedi 'amar Dutt' etc
 lekin yaheen se yah parampara samaptpraaya he
 The reason is that this tradition was new in Hindi and completely influenced by Anglo literature
 bhartiya vaataavaran ke anuroop na hone ke kaaran pathak jaldi isse ub gaya
 The anorexia of the readers also made tilasmi, ayari and espionage literature in abeyance itself
 premchand ke avataran ke saath hi chitrapat puri tarah parivartit ho chukaa tha
 Tilasmi and espionage literature went into the background around 1917-18
 beesvin shatee ke tisare dashak main manovaigyanik or ghatana pradhan upanyaason ne dastak di

 premchand ke ‘durgadas’ or chatur sen shastri ke ‘rana raaj singh’ ne to aiyaari-tilsmi-jasusi sahitya kaa tirodhan kara diya or yaheen se yah parampara samaapt ho gayi
 While writing about Hindi science fiction, people often refer to Keshav Prasad Singh's 'chandralok Ki Yatra' as the first science fiction
 abhi tak aisa hi abhimath he
 Perhaps the reason for this is the commentary of Pt
 Srinarayan Chaturvedi that he gave at the beginning of the story section of 'diamond Jubilee special issue' published to commemorate 60 years of 'saraswati' magazine
 ‘saraswati’ ke bhaag 1, sankhya 6, main pahili baar do kahaniyaan ek saath prakashit hui
 Kishori Lal Goswami's 'indumati' and Keshav Prasad Singh's 'travel to Chandralok'
 chaturvedi ji in par tippanee karte hai-duusari kahani kisi angreji kahani ke aadhaar par likhi hui maaloom hoti he
 She is tall and was published serially
 ‘indumati’ saraswati hi main nahin, hindi main aadhunik style kii pratham kahani he
 ' ‘chandralok kii yatra’ ko to unhone angl-aadhrut kahkar mahatvaheen kar diya lekin ‘indumati’ ko pahili hindi kahani ghoshit kiya
 'earlier' Harishchandra Chandrika 'and' Piyush Pravah 'had one or two stories
 pan ambika dutt vyas kii ‘aashcharya-vrittant’ naam kii or pan bal krishna bhatta kii ‘nutan brahychari’ naamak kahaniyaan sambhawatah iske pahile kii prakashit ho chuki thim
 But 'indumati' is credited with being the first modern story of Hindi
 ’ Probably he ended his talk by saying, but if there had been an attempt to investigate it, then the confusion would have ended which is the first Hindi science fiction? Although this discussion continues in Hindi, which is the first modern story of Hindi
 


‘indumati’ ? insha allaa khan kii 1803 main prakashit ‘rani ketki kii kahani ? yaa phir 1870 main prakashit meerut main pan gauri dutt pranit ‘devraani jethaani kii kahani’ jo vastutah ek laghu saamaajik upanyaas he
