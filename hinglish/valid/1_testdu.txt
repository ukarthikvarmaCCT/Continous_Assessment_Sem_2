 is pustak ko kai logon ne khaarij kar diya jab unhone unhen dikhaaya
 Despite this, Ali made no resistance against the standardized mus'haf
 apane jivan ke aakhri saalon main arab janajatiyon ko ek muslim dharmik raajnneeti main ekajute karne ke baad, 632 main mohammad kii mrityu ne is baat par asahmati vyakt kii ki muslim samudaay ke netaa ke rup main unhen koun safal karegaa
 While Ali and the rest of Muhammad's close family were washing their bodies for burial, a small group of Muslims took part in Saqifah, one of Muhammad's close companions, Abu Bakr, was named to lead the community
 dusron ne apana samarthan joda or abu bakar ko pehla khalipha banaaya gaya tha
 The choice of Abu Bakr was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who said that Ali was nominated by Muhammad as his successor
 baad main jab fatimah or ali ne khalipha ke adhikaar ke maamle main sahaygiyon se sahaayta maangi, to unhone uttar diya, 'he bhagwaan ke macenjar kii beti! hamane abu bakar ko apana nishtha diya he
 If Ali had come to us earlier, we certainly would not have abandoned him
 ali ne kaha, 'kya yah uchit tha ki paigambar ko dafnaae jane se pehle hamen khalipha par jhagada karnaa chahie?' After the Khilafat election, Abu Bakr and Umar along with some other companions went to Fatima's house to force Ali and his supporters who had gathered to pledge their allegiance to Abu Bakr
 phir, yah aarope lagaaya gaya he ki umr ne aag lagane kii dhamkee di thi jab tak ve baahar nahin aae or abu bakar ke prati nishtha kii kasam khai
 Fatima, in support of her husband, triggered a seduction and threatened to "expose her hair", to which Abu Bakr repented and withdrew
 ali ne baar-baar kaha he ki unke saath chalis purush the, unhone virodh kiya hoga
 Ali did not actively assert his authority because he did not want to throw the nascent Muslim community into conflict
 anya sutron kaa kahana he ki ali ne umr ke chayan ko khalipha ke rup main sweekaar kar liya or yahaan tak ki unki betiyon um kulthum ko shaadi main bhi diya
 This controversial issue later divided Muslims into two groups, Sunni and Shia
 sunnis ne jor dekar kaha ki mohammad ne kabhi uttaradhikari niyukt nahin kiya he, phir bhi abu bakar muslim samudaay dwaara pehle khalif chune gaye the
 Sunnis identify the first four Caliphs as the rightful successors of Muhammad
 shiyas kaa maananaa he ki mohammad ne spasht rup se ali ko gadir khum main unke uttaradhikari ke rup main namit kiya or muslim netritv unase sambandhit tha jo divya aadesh dwaara nirdhaarit kiye gaye the
 According to Wilferd Madelung, Ali himself was convinced of his legitimacy for the Caliph based on his close association with Muhammad, his close relationship and his knowledge of Islam and his qualifications in serving his virtues
 unhone abu bakar se kaha ki khalipha ke rup main nishtha ko pratigya karne main unki deree unke pehle ke sheershak kii unki dharna par aadhaarit thi
 Ali ultimately pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr and then to Umar and Uthman, but did so for the unity of Islam, once it became clear that the Muslims had turned away from him
 ali ne yah bhi mana ki vah is ladaai ke bina imamet kii apni bhoomika puri kar saktaa he
 At the beginning of the Caliphate of Abu Bakr, there was a dispute between Muhammad's daughter, especially Phadak, Fatimah and Ali on one side and Abu Bakr on the other
 fatima ne abu bakar se apni sampatti, fada or khayabar kii bhoomi ko badalane ke liye kaha 
 But Abu Bakr refused and told him that the prophets had no inheritance and that Phadak belonged to the Muslim community
 abu bakar ne usase kaha, "allaah ke prerit ne kaha, hamaare uttaradhikari nahin hai, jo kuch bhi ham chhodte hai vah sadaaka he 
 "together with Umm Ayman, Ali testified to the fact that Muhammad gave it to Fatima Zahra, when Abu Bakr requested him to summon witnesses for his claim
 fatima gusse main ho gai or abu bakar se baat karnaa band kar diya, or jab tak vah mar gai, tab tak vah ravaiya maanate rahe
 'aisha also states that "when the Apostle of Allah died, his wives asked Uthman to send Abu Bakr to ask for his share of the inheritance
 " tab 'aisha ne unase kaha, "kya allaah ke prerit ne nahin kaha,' hamaari sampatti viraasat main nahin he, or jo bhi ham chhodte hai vah daan main kharch kiya janaa chahie?" According to some sources, Ali did not swear allegiance to Abu Bakr sometime after the death of his wife Fatima in the year 633
 'ali ne abu bakar ke antim sanskaar main bhaag liya
 He pledged allegiance to the second Khalifa Umar ibn Khattab and helped him as a trusted advisor
 umr vishesh rup se ali par madina ke mukhya nyaayadhish ke rup main nirbhar tha
 He advised Umar to set the hijra as the beginning of the Islamic calendar
 umr ne raajnneetik muddon ke saath-saath dharmik logon main ali ke sujhaavon kaa istemaal kiya
 'ali was one of the electoral council to elect a third caliph appointed by Omar
 haalanki 'ali do pramukh ummidavaaron main se ek tha, parishad kii vyavastha unke khilaaf thi
 Saad ibn Abi Waqqas and Abdur Rahman bin Awf, who were cousins, were naturally inclined to support Uthman, who was Abdur Rahman's son-in-law
 iske alaava, umr ne abdur rahamaan ko casting vot diya
 Abdur Rahman offered the Caliph to Ali on the condition that he should rule according to the Quran, the example set by Muhammad, and the precedent set by the first two Caliphs
 ali ne teesri shart se inkaar kar diya jabaki uthman ne use sweekaar kar liya
 His reputation at the summit of Ilokens Ali was emphasized according to the comments of Ilon Abi al-hadid, but most voters reluctantly urged Uthman and Ali to support him
 'uthman ebn' afaan ne apane rishtedaar banu abd-shams kii ore udaartaa vyakt kii, jo unke upar haaavee hone lagate the, or abu dhar al-ghifaari, abd-allaah ebn masood or amaar jaise kai shuruaati saathi ke prati unke ghamandi durvyavhaar ebn yasir ne logon ke kuch samoohon ke bich apmaan ko uksaaya
 Dissatisfaction and resistance openly arose in most of the empire from 650–651 onwards
 unke shashan or unke dwaara niyukt sarkaron ke saath asantosh arab ke baahar praanton tak hi simit nahin tha
 When Uthman's relatives, especially Marwan, gained control over him, the Great Council, which included most of the members of the Voters' Council, turned against him or at least withdrew his support, pressuring the Caliphate and his ways
 Reducing the impact of your firm relationship
 is samay, ali ne uthman par sidhe virodh kiye bina ek sanyam prabhaav ke rup main kaary kiya tha
 On several occasions Ali disagreed with Udhaman in the application of Hudud; He had publicly shown sympathy for Abu Dhrr al-ghifari and spoke strongly in defense of Ammar ibn Yasir
 unhone uthman ko anya sahyogiyon kii aalochanaon ke bare main bataaya or uthman kii taraf se prantiy virodhiyon ke saath vaartakar ke rup main kaary kiya jo madina aae the; is vajah se ali or uthman ke parivaar ke bich kuch avishvaas utpann hua prathit hota he
 Eventually, he tried to reduce the severity of the siege with his insistence that Uthman should be allowed water
 itihaaskaaron ke bich ali or uthman ke bich sambandhon ke bare main vivaad he
 Although pledging allegiance to Uthman, Ali disagreed with some of his policies
 vishesh rup se, unhone dharmik kanoon ke sawaal par uthman ke saath sangharsh kiya
 He insisted that religious punishment should be done in many cases like Ubaid Allah ibn Umar and Walid ibn Ukba
 tirthayatra ke dauraan 650 main, unhone uthman se prarthana anushthan ke parivartan ke liye apmaan ke saath saamana kiya
 When Uthman announced that he would take whatever he had from the fees, Ali said that the caliph would be forced into that case
 ali ne ebn masood jaise khalipha dwaara maatrutiv se saathi kii raksha karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Therefore, some historians consider Ali as one of the leading members of Uthman's opposition, if not the chief
 lekin wilferd madelangais tathy ke kaaran unke faisle ko khaarij kar diya gaya ki ali ke paas khalipha ke rup main chune jane ke liye kuraishi kaa samarthan nahin tha
 According to him, there is no evidence that Ali had close ties with the rebels who supported his caliphate or directed his actions
 kuch anya sutron kaa kahana he ki ali ne uthman par sidhe virodh kiye bina ek sanyam prabhaav ke rup main kaary kiya tha
 However, Madelang told Marwan that Ali's grandson Zayn al-abidin had said that koi bhi aapke guru kii tulana main hamaare guru kii tulana main adhik samshitoshna tha
 During one of the most difficult periods in Muslim history, Ali was the Caliph between 656 and 661, which also coincided with the first Fitnah
 chunki jin sangharshon main ali shaamil the, ve dhruviya sampradayik itihaslekh main kaayam the, jeevani saamagree aksar pakshpatpurna hoti he
 But the sources agree that he was a deeply religious man, who was ruled by justice because of Islam and according to the Quran and Sunnah; He was engaged in a war against Muslims in terms of religious duties
 sutron ne apane tapasya, dharmik kartavyon kaa kathor paalan, or sansaarik vastuon se alag hone par notice main ullekh kiya he
 Thus some authors have reported that they lack political skills and flexibility
 uthman kii hatya kaa matlab tha ki vidrohiyon ko ek nayaa khalipha chunanaa padaa
 This met with difficulties as the rebels were divided into several groups including Muhajirun, Ansar, Egyptians, Kufans and Basarites
 teen ummidavaar the: ali, talhah or al-jubayr 
 First the rebels approach Ali, requesting him to be the fourth Caliph
 mohammad ke kuch saathi ne ali ko karyaalay sweekaar karne ke liye raji karne kii koshish kii, lekin unhone prastaav ko band kar diya, ek pramukh ke bajaay paramarshdaata hone kaa suzav diya
 Talha, Zubayr, and other companions refused the Khalifa's offer of rebels
 isliye, vidrohiyon ne madina ke nivaasiyon ko ek din ke bheetar ek khalipha chunane kii chetavanee di, yaa ve kathor karrwai lagu karenge
 To resolve the deadlock, Muslims gathered at al-masjid an-nabawi on June 18, 656 to appoint a caliph
 prarambh main, 'ali ne ise sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya, kyonki sirf unke sabase shashakt samarthak vidrohiyon the
 However, when some of Muhammad's notable companions other than the residents of Medina urged him to accept the offer, he eventually agreed
 abu mekhanaaf ke mutabikka varnan, talhah pehle pramukh saathi the jinhone 'ali ko apana pratigya di, lekin anya kathaon ne anyathaa daawa kiya ki unhen apni pratigya dene ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 In addition, Talhah and az-zubayr later claimed that they reluctantly supported him
 bhale hi, ali ne in daavon ko khaarij kar diya, jor dekar kaha ki unhone unhen sleep swechha se manyata di he
 Wilferd Madelung believes the force did not urge people to pledge and publicly pledged at the mosque
 jabaki madina kii aabaadi ke saath-saath kai vidrohiyon ne apni pratigya di, kuch mahatvapurn aankade yaa janajatiyon ne aisa nahin kiya
 Uthman's relatives fled to the Umayyad Levant, or remained in their homes, later denying 'ali's legitimacy'
 saad ebn abi vakkaas anupasthit the or 'abdulla ebn' umr ne apane nishtha kii peshkash karne se roak diya, lekin donon ne 'ali ko aashwaasan diya ki ve unke khilaaf kaary nahin karenge
 Ali thus inherited the Rashidun Caliphate — which stretched from Egypt in the west to the Iranian hills in the east — while the situation in Hejaz and other provinces on the eve of his election was unsettled
 ali khalipha banane ke turant baad, unhone prantiy governron ko khaarij kar diya jinhen uthman ne niyukt kiya tha, unhen bharosemand sahyogiyon ke saath badal diya tha
 He acted against the lawyers of Mugira ibn Shuba and Ibn Abbas, who had carefully advised them to proceed with their rule
 madelang kaa kahana he ki ali apane adhikaar or unke dharmik mishan se gaharaai se aashwast the, raajnneetik yogyata ke liye apane siddhanton se samjhauta karne ke icchhuk nahin the, or baari baadhaon ke khilaaf ladane ke liye taiyaar the
 Mu'awiyah I, the founder of Uthman and the governor of the Levant, refused to submit to Ali's orders; He was the only governor to do so
 hagiya sophia main islamic sulekh ke saath ali kaa naam, jab unhen khalipha niyukt kiya gaya, ali ne madina ke nagarikon se kaha ki muslim raajnneeti asantosh or vivaad se peedit hui he; vah kisi bhi buraai ke islam ko shuddh karnaa chahta tha
 He advised the population to behave as true Muslims, warning that it would not tolerate any treason and that those found guilty of subversive activities would be dealt with harshly
 aaisha, talha, al-zubair or umayyadon, vishesh rup se muawiyah i or maravan main, dangaiyon jo maar daalaa tha dandit karne ke liye karnaa chahta tha 'ali uthman
 They camped close to Basra
 vaarta kai dinon tak chali or baad main garam vinimay or parali ke dauraan virodh pradarshnon se uda, jisase donon taraf jivan kii haani hui
 The battle of camels in confusion began in 656, where Ali emerged victorious
 kuch itihaaskaar maanate hai ki unhone is mudde kaa istemaal apni raajnneetik mahatvakankshaon ko khojane ke liye kiya kyonki unhen ali ke khalipha apane phaayde ke khilaaf mila
 The rebels said that Uthman was executed for not ruling according to the Quran and Sunnah, so no retaliation was to be done
 kuch log kehete hai ki khalipha vidrohiyon kaa uphaar tha or ali ke paas unhen niyantrit karne yaa dandit karne ke liye paryaapt bal nahin tha, jabaki anya kehete hai ki ali ne vidrohiyon ke tark ko sweekaar kiya yaa kam se kam vichaar nahin kiya uthman ek shaasha shaasha
 Under such circumstances, a dispute ensued that started the first civil war in Muslim history
 uthamanion ke naam se jane vaale kuch musalamaanon ne uthman ko ant tak ek sahi or sirf khalipha mana, jise avaidh tareeke se maar diya gaya tha
 Some others, known as Ali's party, believed that Uthman had fallen into error, seized the caliphate and refused to reform or step in their own way legally
 Was executed in law; Thus Ali was just and true Imam and atheists among his opponents
 yah khud ali kii sthiti nahin thi
 This civil war created permanent divisions within the Muslim community who had legitimate authority to occupy the Caliphate
 pratham fitnaa, 656-661, uthman kii hatya ke baad, ali ke khalipha ke dauraan jari rakhaa, or khalipha ke muavia kii dharna dwaara samaapt kiya gaya tha
 This civil war is regretted as the end of the early unity of the Islamic Ummah
 ali ne basra ke governor 'abd allaah ebn al'-abbaas niyukt kiye or iraq main muslim garrison shahar kupha main apni rajdhani chali gai
 After the roman-persian Wars and the Byzantine Sasani War that lasted for hundreds of years, there were deep-rooted differences between Iraq, formally in the Persian Sassanid Empire and Syria formally under the Byzantine Empire
 iraqi chaahate the ki nae sthapit islamic rajya kii rajdhani kupha main ho taaki ve apane kshetra main rajasav laa saken or syria kaa virodh kar saken
 He convinced Ali to come to Kufa and establish a capital at Kufa in Iraq
 baad main levant ke governor muvayah pratham or uthman ke chachere bhai ne ali kii nishtha kii maangon se inkaar kar diya
 Ali opened up hopes of regaining his allegiance, but Muawiyah insisted on Levant autonomy under his rule
 muvayah ne apane laventine samarthakon ko sangathit karke or ali ko shradhanjali arpit karne se inkaar kar diya ki unke dal ne apane chunaav main bhaag nahin liya tha
 Ali shifted his forces to the north and the two armies encamped themselves in Siffin for more than a hundred days, most of the time being spent in conversation
 yadhyapi ali ne muvayah ke saath kai patron kaa aadan-pradaan kiya, lekin vah uttararddh ko khaarij karne main asamarth tha, na hi use nishtha dene kaa vachan dene ke liye raji kiya
 a confrontation between the parties led to the Battle of Siffin in 657
 ek saptaah ke yuddh ke baad ek hinsak ladaai ke baad lalit al-harir ke naam se janaa jaataa tha, muvayah kii sena margauntarit hone ke bindu par thi jab amrit ebn al-aas ne muvayah ko apane sainikon ko oochhaalane kii salaah di thi 
 Ali watched through the stratagem, but only a minority wanted to chase the fight
 aakhir main do senaayen is baat ko sulajhane ke liye sahamat huin ki madhyasthata se khalipha koun hona chahie
 The refusal of the largest block in Ali's army to fight was the deciding factor in the acceptance of arbitration
 sawaal yah he ki kya madhyasth ali yaa kufaan kaa pratinidhitiv karegaa, ali kii sena main aage vibhaajan hua he
 Ashath ibn q and some others rejected Ali's candidates as 'abd Allah ibn' Abbas and Malik al-ashtar, and insisted on Abu Musa Ashari for his neutrality
 ant main, ali ko abu musa ko sweekaar karne kaa aagrah kiya gaya tha
 Amrit ibn al-a was appointed by Mu'awiyah as a mediator
 saat maheene baad do madhyasthon ne farvari 658 main jordan main maan ke uttar pashchim main 10 mile uttar pashchim main mulaakaat kii
 Amrit ibn al-abu Musa Ashari assured that both Ali and Mu'awiyah should step in and elect a new caliph
 ali or unke samarthak is faisle se dar gaye the, jisane khalipha ko vidrohi muvayah kii sthiti main kam kar diya tha
 Therefore Ali was called by Mu'awiyah and Amr ibn al-s
 jab daumit-ul-jandal main madhyasthon ne ikattha kiya, to unke liye maamalon kii charchaa karne ke liye dainik baithkon kii ek shrinkhalaa kii vyavastha kii gai
 When it came time to make a decision about the Caliph, Amrit bin al-aas convinced Abu Musa al-ashari to entertain that he should deprive both Ali and Mu'awiya of the Caliphate, and the Muslims to make elections
 The Caliph Abu Musa al-ashari also decided to act accordingly
 punavala ke anusaar, aisa lagata he ki madhyasthon ke bahishkaar ke saath madhyasth or anya pratishthit vyaktiyon ne janvari 65 9 main nae khalif ke chayan par charchaa ke liye mulaakaat kii
 Amrit supported Muawiyah, while Abu Musa preferred his son-in-law Abdullah ibn Umar, but the latter unanimously refused to stand for election
 abu musa ne prastaavit kiya, or amrit sahamat hue, ali or muvayah donon ko chhodane or shura ko nae khalif kaa chayan jamaa karne ke liye sahamat hue
 The public declaration after Abu Musa saw his share of the pact, but Amrit declared Ali and confirmed Muawiya as the Caliph
 ali ne unke faisle ko sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya or chunaav hone ke liye or madhyasthata kaa paalan karne ke liye apane pratigya kaa ulanghan karne main takneekee rup se paaya
 Ali protested, stating that it was not binding on the contrary to the Quran and Sunnah
 phir usne ek nai sena ko vyavasthit karne kii koshish kii, lekin malik ashtar kii aguai main kurr ke avshesh ansaar, or unke kuch kulon ne vafaadaar bane rahe
 This also put Ali in a vulnerable position among his supporters
 madhyasthata ke parinamswaroop 'ali ke gathbandhan ke vighatan main, or kuch ne kaha he ki yah muvayah kaa iraadaa tha
 The most vocal opponents in Ali's camp were the same people who forced Ali into a ceasefire
 unhone ali ke bal se tod diya, naaraazgi ke tahat raily "madhyasthata akele bhagwaan se sambandhit he
 “this group came to be known as Kharijites
 unhone sabhi ko apana dushman mana
 In 659 Ali's army and Kharijites met at the Battle of Naharvan
 tab kurra kharijiyon ke naam se janaa jane laga
 The Kharijites then started killing Ali's supporters and other Muslims
 unhone kisi aise vyakti ko mana jo avishvasi ke rup main apane samooh kaa hissaa nahin tha
 Although 'ali won the battle by a large margin, the constant struggle was beginning to affect his position
 iraqiyon se nipatane ke dauraan, ali ko ek anushaasit sena or prabhavi rajya sansthaanon kaa nirmaan karnaa mushkil ho gaya
 He spent a lot of time fighting the Kharijites
 natijatan, 'ali ko apane purvi morche par rajya kaa vistaar karnaa mushkil ho gaya
 Around the same time, unrest was brewing in Egypt
 misr ke rajyapal, kus ko yaad kiya gaya tha, or ali ne unhen mohammad ebn abi bakar ke saath badal diya tha
 Mu'awiyah allowed 'amrit ibn al' to conquer Egypt and Amrit successfully did so
 amrit ne pehle romanon se atharah saal pehle misr liya tha lekin uthman ne use barkhaast kar diya tha
 Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr had no popular support in Egypt and managed to reunite with 2000 men but they dispersed without fighting

 Apart from Muhammad, there is no one in Islamic history that has been written in Islamic languages as Ali
 muslim samskruti main, ali ko unke saahas, gyaan, vishwaas, eemaandaaree, islam ke prati samarpan, mohammad ko gahari vafadari, sabhi musalamaanon ke samaan upachaar or parajeet dushmano ko kshamaa karne main udaartaa ke liye sammanit kiya jaataa he, or isliye rahasyamay paramparaon ke liye centre he islam main sufiwaad jaise
 Ali retains his stature as an authority on Quranic exegesis, Islamic jurisprudence and religious thought
 ali lagbhag sabhi sufi adeshon main ucch sthaan rakhata he jo unke madhyam se mohammad ko unke vansh kaa pataa lagaataa he
 Ali's influence has been significant throughout Islamic history
 sunni or shiya vidwaan is baat se sahamat hai ki vilaah kii kavita ali ke sammaan main sunai gai thi, lekin vilaayah or imamet kii alag-alag vyakhyaayein hai
 Sunni scholars believe that the poem is about Ali, but he is not identified as an Imam, in Shia Muslim thought, that Ali was chosen by God as Muhammad's successor
 ali yaa anya shiya imam kaa zikr karte hue shiya vidwaanon dwaara vyakhya kiye gaye kai chand hai
 Answering the question as to why the names of the Imams are not mentioned in the Quran, Muhammad al-baqir answers: "allah revealed salat to his Prophet but never said about the three or four rak'ahs, Revealed Zakat but did not mention its details Haj but its Tawaf and Prophet were not counted
 unhone is kavita kaa khulaasa kiya or paigambar ne kaha ki yah kavita ali, hasan, hossain or baarah imam ke bare main he
 "according to Ali a quarter of Quranic verses are telling the Imam's station
 mamen ne in chhandon main se kai ko shiya islam ke parichay main soochibaddh kiya he
 However, there are some verses that some Sunni commentators interpret in the context of Ali, among which Villah's verse that Sunni and Shiite scholars refer to the incident Ali gave his ring to a beggar who prayed rituals in the mosque Asked the devotees
 mavadda kii kavita chhandon main se ek he, donon sunni or shiyite ne ali ke naam ko kuch anya naamon ke saath joda
 The above verse of Mubhala, and also verse 2: 269 in which Ali is honored with unique knowledge by both Shia and Sunni commentators such verses
 shiya mohammad ke baad ali ko sabase mahatvapurn vyakti maanate hai or vah apni smriti main ek jatil, puranic vyakti kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 He is a paragon of virtues, such as courage, greatness, honesty, straightforwardness, eloquence and deep knowledge
 ali dharmi tha lekin anyaay kaa saamana karnaa padaa, vah aadhikarik tha lekin dayaalu or vinamr, joardaar lekin marij bhi, siikhaa lekin shramik vyakti bhi tha
 According to Shia, Muhammad suggested on various occasions during his lifetime that Ali should be the leader of Muslims after his death
 yah kai hadison dwaara samarthit he, jinhen shams dwaara sunaaya gaya he, jisamen khum ke talab ke haddees, do bharpurn chizon ke haddees, kalam or paper ke haddees, clok ke haddees, pad ke haddees, nimath ke nimantran kareebi parivaar, or baarah uttaradhikari ke haddees 
 Jafar al-sadiq narrates in the Hadith that whatever virtue found in Muhammad was found in Ali, who would turn away from Allah and his Prophet, under his guidance
 ali swayan varnan karata he ki vah allaah tak pahunchane ke liye pravesh dwaar or paryvekshak he
 According to this view, Ali as Muhammad's heir did not rule the community in justice, but also interpreted Sharia law and its esoteric meaning
 isliye unhen truti or paap se mukt mana jaataa tha, or mohammad ke madhyam se divya decri dwaara bhagwaan dwaara niyukt kiya gaya tha
 It is believed in Twelver and Ismaili Shi Islam that 'ekal was the source of divine wisdom, the spirits of the prophets and the Imams and was given esoteric knowledge called Goom and their sufferings were a means of divine grace to their devotees
 yadhyapi imam ek divya prakaashan kaa praptakarta nahin tha, phir bhi vah bhagwaan ke saath ghanishtha sambandh tha, jiske madhyam se bhagwaan use maargdarshan karata he, or imam badale main logon kaa maargdarshan karata he
 His words and deeds are a guide and model for the community; as a result it is the source of Sharia law
 shiya tirthayatri aamtaur par ziyaarat ke liye najaaf main mashad ali jate hai, vahaan prarthana karte hai or " ziyaarat amin allaah " yaa anya ziyaaratnanaam padhate hai
 Under the Safavid Empire, his tomb became the center of much devoted attention, exemplified by Shah Ismail i in his pilgrimage to Najaf and Karbala
 kai shiya muslim bhi imam ali kii jayanti ko pita diwas ke rup main manaate hai
 Gregory date changes every year for: mukhya lekh: ali ke sunni drishysunise ali ko chauthe khalipha ke rup main dekhte hai
 Ali is also known as one of the greatest warrior champions of Islam
 udaahranon main trench kii ladaai main kurish champion ko shaamil karnaa shaamil he jab kisi or ne dar nahin diya
 After several unsuccessful attempts to break the fort at the Battle of Khyber, Ali was summoned, miraculously recovered and the fort was conquered
 lagbhag sabhi sufi aadesh ali ke madhyam se mohammad ko apni vanshavali kaa pataa lagaate hai, jo abu bakar ke madhyam se jane vaale nakshabandi ke apwaad hai
 Even in this order, Ali's great great grandson is Jafar al-sadiq
 sufi kaa maananaa he ki ali ne mohammad se santrupt shakti vilaah se viraasat main pravesh kiya jo bhagwaan ko aadhyatmik yatra sambhav banaata he
 Like the famous Sufi Ali Huwiri claims that the tradition started with Ali and regarded the Junayd of Baghdad as the Ali Sheikh doctrines and practices of Sufiism
 suphis ne ali kii prashansa main maanakabat ali ko padhaa 
 Ali is recorded in some traditions as forbidden to those who sought to worship him in his lifetime
 jaise kuch samoohon Alawites vishwaas he ki ali parameshwar tha daawa kar rahe hai avatar
 He is described as Ghulat by the majority of Islamic scholars
 paramparaagat musalamaanon ke mutabik, in samoohon main islam chhod diya gaya he kyonki ve maanav ke prashansaneey gunon ke atvaad ke kaaran hai
 In ali-illahism, a syncretic belief has been consistently there at the religion centers incarnation of their deity throughout history, and reverence especially for Bhandar 'ali, the son of Muhammad, is considered one such incarnation
 druj, ek samadharmi dharm, maanate hai ki bhagwaan tha avatarit manushya main vishesh rup se, al-hakim bi-amr allaah ali ke vanshaj
 See also: Historiography of early Islam The primary sources for scholarship on the life of Ali are the Quran and Ahmadi, along with other texts of early Islamic history
 vyapak madhyamik sroton main, sunni or shia musalamaanon, isai arabon, hinduon or madhya purv or asia ke anya gaiyr-musalamaanon ke lekhan or aadhunik pashchimi vidwaanon dwaara kuch kaaryon ke alaava, shaamil hai
 However, some of the earliest Islamic sources are colored by a positive or negative bias towards Ali
 in kathanon ke khilaaf pehle pashchimi vidwaanon ke bich ek aam pravriti rahi thi or baad main sunni or shia pakshpatpurna padon kii pravriti ke kaaran baad kii avadhi main ekatrit reportein huin; baad main banaavat ke rup main unke bare main aise vidwaan

 dusron ke kashton or sanvegon kaa anubhav karne or samajhane ko tadnubhuti yaa samanubhuti kehete hai
 Empathy is contrasted with empathy and contrasted with apathy
 asamanubhuti main koi vyakti logon ke ksht ko samajhane or mahasoos karne kii baat to dur vah unke vipareet hota he
 Empathy differs from indifference, while empathy is way ahead
 samanubhuti main do pahalu paye jate hai- ek, samanubhuti vaala vyakti vah mahasoos karata he, jo doosraa mahasoos karata he
 Second, a person with empathy can understand what the other feels
 pehle ghatak ko bhavatmak ghatak kehete hai jo sabhi praaniyon main hota he
 Whereas the cognitive component of empathy occurs only in humans
 dusron ke ksht yaa sanvegon ko duusare ke pariprekshya se samajhane kii yogyata keval manushya main hoti he
 According to social psychologists, the method of taking perspective from the sufferings or emotions of others is called empathy
 pariprekshya gran teen prakaar kaa hota he- One way that empathy occurs in a person's mind is by imagining what will be the result of an event on another person
 ise 'rahgeer kii samanubhuti', kehete hai
 When people who do not go through an earthquake, terrorist attack or drought disaster or tragedy come forward to help such people, it is called empathy based on the way of other imagined perspective
 kisi vyakti ke man main samanubhuti utpann hone kaa doosraa tarika yah hota he ki vah kalpana kare ki koi ghatana yadi uske saath hoti ho use kaisaa lagata
 This is the self-conceived perspective
 jaise baadh yaa tufaan kii ghatana ko dekhne ke baad use apane upar laga kar dekhnaa ki uskaa parinaam kya hoga, yah swa kalpana pariprekshya he
 The tendency to help in empathy, based on a self-conceived perspective, intensifies
 log adhik samanubhuti vyakt karte hai, jab ve usee prakaar kii aapadaa kaa saamana karte hai
 For example, people who have previously experienced hurricanes will be particularly responsive to individuals affected by the storm
 jinhone bhuskhalan evam baadh kaa saamana kiya hoga, ve un logon kii tulana main jinhone aisi vipadaa na jheli ho, jaise ve baadh peediton ke prati adhik pratikriya karenge
 Those who have experienced poverty tend to react more deeply to the poor person
 kisi vyakti ke man main samanubhuti paidaa hone kaa ek tarika phantasy bhi hoti he
 This empathy is for a fictitious character, fictitious person or animal
 titannic film dekhne ke dauraan ant main titannic jahaaj ke dub janaa or apni premika ke liye qurbaani dekhakar film ke anya paatro ke saath ronaa phantasy ke aadhaar par paidaa hui samanubhuti he

 The Subject Headings Authority File or SWD is a controlled keyword or descriptor system, that is mainly used for indexing in libraries
 The SWD is managed by the German National Library in cooperation with various library networks
 The inclusion of keywords in the SWD is defined by "rules for the Keyword Catalog"
 Similar systems in other languages are the Library of Congress Subject Headings and the Répertoire d'autorité-matière encyclopédique et alphabétique unifié
 Since April 2012 the SWD is part of the Integrated Authority File
 The SWD has about 600,000 descriptors and 700,000 non-descriptors as well as synonymous descriptor chains with references to a descriptor
 Its growth rate is about 5
5% per year
 About three-quarters of the descriptors refer to individual concepts and a quarter are abstract concepts
 Linking using hierarchical and associative relations is not very dense, so the SWD cannot be viewed as a thesaurus 
 The terms in the SWD are also arranged in a separate classification with nearly 500 classes in 36 main groups
 The various terms are placed in a classification scheme and also contain references to sources, related terms, preferred term and to a lesser extent hierarchical links
 But the SWD is probably not a complete thesaurus because of the low degree of linkage
 The SWD is available online through the catalogue database ILTIS and is available for a fee as BIBLIODATA, together with the Name Authority File and the Corporate Bodies Authority File on the standard data CD-ROM and the standard file TITAN
 In both cases, the user interface of the SWD leaves much room for improvement
 Instead of making SWD accessible as a user-friendly navigation tool, it assumes that users are familiar with SWD and its classification scheme and enter the appropriate descriptor in the correct form before running a search
 Navigating the system or moving from one concept to another by means of hyperlinks is not possible
 The strategy of the German Library to distribute authority records commercially makes the extended use of the SWD difficult, e
g
 in other keyword systems
 For the exchange of authority records, there is a separate machine exchange format for Libraries format
 The head official of the Southwest German Library Network offers online access

 devendra mewari The field of science writing is very vast
 aap anek madhyamon ke liye vividh prakaar kaa lekhan kar sakate hai or vigyaan lekhak ban sakate hai
 Any person would like to become a science writer so that he can inform people about various fields of science
 agar aap mujhase puuchhen ki main vigyaan lekhan kyon karata hum to meraa uttar he ki mujhe apni duniya, apni prakruti or is vishaal brahmad ke bare main jo kuch pataa lage use main aapako or dusron ko bhi bataa sakuun
 Can i tell why the sun comes out every day, why it sinks, why the cold moon comes out, why the stars flicker, why a star breaks in the sky, why is the sky so infinite? Why do plants grow, do they even have life, why do flowers bloom, where did humans come, why do birds fly, where do animals come from, where do insects come from, why do jugunu shine, how do fish breathe in water Why rivers flow, why seas are formed, why clouds form, why it rains, why snow falls
 or bhi na jane kitna kuch
 Write for whom? It is very important to know for whom we write
 hamaare pathak, hamaare shrota or darshak koun hai? main samajhataa hum, ham logon ke aasapaas, samaaj main kam-se kam teen tarah ke pathak, shrota, darshak to hai hi- vaigyanik, chaatr va shikshak or jan saamaanya
 Which of these is our target class? Meaning which of these readers, audience or audience do we want to write for? It is very important to know the goal for perforation the goal of writing
 pehle lakshya varg main vaigyanik hai, jo vaigyanik bhashaa main likhte hai or anya vaigyanik us bhashaa ko samajhate hai
 The second target class is teachers and students
 inke liye vaigyanik paathya pustaken tathaa vaigyanik lekh likhe jate hai jinamein arddh takneekee bhashaa kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 This type of scientific writing follows the leaks of teachers 'lecture notes' or 'classroom notes'
 chaatr usee arddh takneekee bhashaa ko padhate-padhate snaatak str par vaigyanikon kii takneekee bhashaa samajhane main samarth hone lagate hai
 There are crores of people in the third category
 inamen ghar or ghar se baahar kaam karte log hai, gruhaniyaan hai, khet-khalihaanon main kaam karne vaale kisaan hai, karyaalayon main kaam karne vaale karmchaaree, kal-kaarkaanon main kaam karne vaale majdoor hai
 And yes, they also have scientists returning home from the laboratory and students returning from classes
 in karodon logon ko apane khaali vakt main padhane, sunne or dekhne ke liye jaankaree chahie
 They want all kinds of information
 ham is vishaal varg ko vigyaan kii jaankaree dekar inamen vaigyanik chetana jagaa sakate hai
 This is our social responsibility
 ham samaaj main vaigyanik drushtikon kaa vikaas karne main madad kar sakate hai
 What kind of thinking is developing in society, what kind of traditions are taking birth - it mainly depends on this class
 yahi kaaran he ki vaigyanik jaankaree ke abhaav main isi varg main bhoot-pret or chudilon kii awajahi chalati rahati he, murtiyon ke doodh pine kii khabar jangal kii aag kii tarah fail jaati he, raaton ko pathar barasate hai or garib asahaay auraten dian maan kar maar di jaati hai

 Read a lot: The more 'you will write the more you will be very good, multi-read, so keep reading more and more books and articles and news from various fields of science
 aap vigyaan ke bare main jitna adhik sunenge, jitna adhik padhenge- utani hi acchhee tarah vigyaan kii baaten apane pathakon or shrotaaon ko samajha sakenge
 In my view, more than being a science student or not, it is more important that you are interested in science, interested in telling things about science and have patience to understand science
 aap vigyaan kii kai baaten aasaani se samaj lenge or samajha sakenge
 If you have not been a student of science then become one now

 In this way, understand and explain science with self-education
 kis madhyam ke liye kya likhen vigyaan lekhan pehle keval lekh, pustaken or vaarta tak hi simit tha

 But today science writer has immense possibilities to write
 vah kai madhyamon yaa media ke liye likh saktaa he
 Can do a variety of writing
 inamen se kuch madhyam arthath media tathaa lekhan ke prakaar hai: • print media -samachar patr, lekh, feechar, vyangy, niyamit kalam, vigyaan kathaayen, saakshaatkaar-patrikaayenlekh, kavitaayen, naatak, vyangy, paricharchaa, niyamit kalam, vigyaan kathaayen-pustikaayen, patrak-poster-pustaken -samikshaayen-anuwaad-kamiks tathaa chitrakathaayen • electranik mediaradio- vaarta -paricharchaa -saakshaatkaar-feechar-vigyaan patrika-vigyaan samachar-radio naatak, jhalki, roopak-phone-in kaarykram -brij-in kaarykram -spancerd kaarykram• doordarshan -vigyaan kaarykram prastutikaran -vigyaan samachar-saakshaatkaar-vigyaan vishyak dharawahik -vigyaan vrutt chitra -vigyaan patrika kaarykram -naatak, jhalkiyaan • film-vrutt chitra -feechar film• audio / video casette / si di -vigyaan dharavahik -vigyaan ke rochak kaarykram -vaigyanik gatividhiyaan -vaigyanikon kii jeevani• vigyaan pradarshnee-sankalpana tathaa aalekh-camentry-patrak, pustikaayen, poster• kathputli pradarshnee -natya aalekh• jaadu pradarshnee-andh vishwaason, chamatkaaron ko dur karne ke liye kaarykram sankalpana va aalekh • maukhik madhyam-aalekh• ityadi How to write Different forms and styles of writing vary for each medium
 har madhyam kii jarurat alag-alag hoti he
 Science writing and its features for various mediums are as follows: vigyaan samachar vigyaan kii har ghatana, durghatana, khoj, avishkaar tathaa sambhaavna samachar he
 They can be related to any science subject, laboratories, scientists etc
 vigyaan samachar ko saral tathaa sahaj bhashaa main likhaa janaa chahie taaki vigyaan kii saamaanya jaankaree rakhane vaala yaa vigyaan se anbhigya aam pathak tathaa shrota use aasaani se samaj sake
 Science news is based on facts, so it cannot be talked about here and there
 samachar kaa sheershak sateek or painaa hona chahie
 The title should never be misleading
 use arthpurna or sambhav ho to muhaavareydaar hona chahie
 If you write a short title assuming the essence of science news, then it will be accurate
 mahatvapurn samaacharon kaa sankshipt ‘intro’ bhi likhie taaki use pard kar pathak ko samachar ke bare main mukhya jaankaree mil jaay
 You can give other information in the rest of the science news or body
 feechar tathaa lekhah feechar samachar kaa vistaar he
 After reading the news, the curiosity that arises in the mind of the reader can complete the feature
 feechar usee vishay par sateek jaankaree dene vaali vistrut tippanee he
 Instead of giving reference or description here and there, scientists in the news can give more information about the subject with simple, easy language and interestingness
 atishyoktiyaan daal kar use uthlaa yaa halkaa banane kii bhul bhi mat kiijie
 'man's footsteps on the moon' is enough, do not measure more by writing 'manavga will measure all the three worlds'

 Believe them, they will not handle all the work
 robotics ke vaigyanik unhen jo kaam sikhaa rahe hai philhal vahi karne dijie
 The feature does not have to fill in the data otherwise they will stop the smooth flow of information and the succulents will taste like pebbles
 feechar ko shuru ke akheer tak rochak banaae rakhie
 Article: You wrote the news in brief, giving an abstract
 pathak kii jigyaasa ko puraa karne ke liye rochakata ke saath muhaavareydaar, mjedaar bhashaa main uske liye feechar likhaa
 But, there can be many more things on the subject
 vishay kaa amulchul varnan kar sakate hai
 Now you can fly in the sky of the subject

 micel krikhtan ne jurysik park main dianosoron ko janm dilaayaa jinhen prakhyat nirdeshak steven spilberg ne film main saakaar kar dikhaaya
 And yes, years ago, in his book 'in His Own Image', David Rorwick announced that a clone of an industrialist had been born
 tathyon par dhyaan dene vaale vigyaan lekhakon ko sar jaan gardan ke tedpolon kii koshikaon se mendhak banane ke prayog yaad aae, karl ilmency or peter hope kii clon chuhia yaad ai, jerry haal or rabart stillman kii maanav bhrun se clon banane kii sambhaavna kaa samaran ho aayaa or vishwa bhar main chhidi bahes bhi yaad ai
 Just then, the announcement created a worldwide panic that the human clone 'eve' was born
 are ek clon par itnaa kuch? Much more can be written on this subject
 yani ab aap ‘lekh’ likhie
 Sagar will fit in the same place
 itnaa kuch feechar main to nahin diya ja saktaa naa? lekin lekh main yah sab kuch dekar aap shartiyon apana sikaa jamaa sakate hai
 Your knowledge will become an inspiration for the readers about how much they have read, Father
 kitna-kuch pataa he inhen
 You get a chance to display knowledge in the article, don't miss it
 lekh lanbaa beshak ho, agar neeras na ho anyathaa koun padhegaa use? pathak panne palat degaa
 So write with patience, adopt idiomatic language and interesting style and write as a reader yourself
 agar aap bor ho rahe hai to aapke lekh ko padhane vaale hajaaron, lakhon pathak bhi bor honge
 Don't you want people to say- 'he has written that article
 ’ aapaki jimmedaari banati he
 You are responsible for thousands of readers
 isliye, bahut soch-samaj kar, jimmedaari se likhie
 Editorial: If you work in a newspaper, then the editor can expect you to write an editorial immediately on any vivid or social issue of science
 sampadakeey aise mudde par mahatvapurn tippanee he
 This also shows the importance given by the newspaper to that scientific topic or event
 sampadakeey prishth par praayah teen yaa kabhi-kabhi do sampadakeey die jate hai
 At times, such commentary or editorial may also have a political, social or moral aspect, so writing an editorial is a very responsible job
 ise likhte samay samachaarpatr kii niti ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana aavashyak hota he kyonki sampadakeey ko samachaarpatr kaa vaktavy mana jaataa he
 Take cloning or nuclear tests only
 kya maanav chloning sambandhi prayog kiye jane chahie? yaa inkaa virodh kiya janaa chahie? desh kii parmaanu niti kya honi chahie? isi se sampadakeey drushti kaa pataa lagegaa
 That is why the topic is discussed first in the editorial, then it is analyzed and the closing is done from the editorial point of view
 vyangyah vaigyanik vyangy kaa kshetra abhi tak achoota he
 There are great possibilities of writing in this mode
 bas, ek hi jarurat he- thodaa vakr or paini drushti taaki baat tir kii tarah chubhe bhi or marm ko chhue bhi
 Here is the closing part of a speech by Dr
 Norman Borlaug, a Nobel Prize winning agricultural scientist
 unhone vaigyanikon se kuch yon kaha: homosepience matlab aadmi kii ek nai nasl kaa vikaas karke hamaari sabhyataa kii raksha kiijie
 There is an enzyme in the intestines of that breed that can digest the files of paper and mountains of red ribbon
 usamen saathi insaanon ke prati sahanubhuti va sahaj buddhi kaa jin hona chahie
 There should also be a gene that can reduce child production because history testifies that man has repeatedly invited populations and famines by increasing the population
 stambh / kaalmah kuch samachar patr-patrikaon main vigyaan ke niyamit stambh yaa kalam bhi prakashit hote hai

 Interview: An interview can be prepared on a scientific topic for a newspaper, magazine or radio and television by meeting with a scientist or scientific policy assessor
 yah saakshaatkaar yaa intervyuu bhi kehalaata he
 Before talking about any scientific achievement or research, prepare yourself to ask questions about that subject
 us bare main har sambhav jaankaree kaa pataa lagaaie
 If you want to ask questions on the nuclear explosion, then the country's nuclear research program must be as knowledgeable as possible
 agar maatr samachar likh rahe hai to simit lekin saar rup main jaankaree kaa pataa rahe
 If you want to get an idea for an appendix of a magazine or newspaper, then the conversation will be long
 is tarah ‘samachar’ ke liye bhentvaarta ho sakati he or ‘vichaar’ ke liye bhi
 Certain things must be kept in mind: Take time for an appointment or interview, decide the location, make a questionnaire, find out as much as you can about the scientist, first create an atmosphere of conversation and questions in the same flow Ask too
 aap sankshep main puuchhie, vaigyanik ko bolne dijie lekin vishay se unhen bhi bhatakane na dijie
 There are huge possibilities of popular science writing in this genre
 vigyaan naatakah vigyaan lekhan kii yah ek mahatvapurn vidha he jisamen kaaphi likhaa ja saktaa he
 Till now only nominal has been written in this genre
 vigat kuch varshon main vaigyanik jaagrukta badhaane ke liye vaigyanik nukkad naatak likhe or khele jane lage hai
 Nukkad plays have been influential enough to unleash superstitions
 ab natya style main anek vigyaan dharawahikon kaa prasaaran bhi ho rahaa he
 The famous German playwright Bertolt Brecht has a famous play - Galileo, through which stereotypes and religious bigotry and superstition have been attacked
 bhishma saahani kaa ‘hanoos’ naatak ghadi ke avishkaarak karigar ke sangharsh ko saamne rakhata he
 Famous playwright of India, Pratap Sehgal, based on the discoveries of the ancient Indian scientist Aryabhat I, has composed an 'investigator' drama
 naatak ke samvaad behad shashakt hai: Budhgupta: You should mention your exploration in detail
 aryabhatah main jab bahut chota tha samraat! tabhi, haa, tabhi mujhe acchhee tarah se yaad he xxrep 5 
 ye nakshatra mujhe apni ore aakarshith karte the
 i used to feel as if they were inviting me in silent voices - come, read us, come, read us and i would try to read those nakshatras sitting millions of nights away
 thakkar so jaataa
 Even then, Sun, Moon, Buddha, Mars and not knowing how many constellations and planets would be a part of my dream
 mujhe lagata jaise brahmad mujhe chunauti de rahaa ho- mujhe padho, mujhe pahachaano or maine yah chunauti sweekaar kar lee
 Chintamani: Aryabhat! It seems that you are also a master of acting arts
 aryabhatah haa, bharat, bhaas, kalidas, sabhi hamaari dhamniyon main behate rakt kaa ansh hai, hamaare hriday kaa spandan hai or parampara se mili viraasat
 Chudamani: The person who denies the tradition does not suit the tradition of the emperor! aryabhatah anveshan parampara kaa nishedh nahin, uskaa vikaas he
 No investigator can explore until he questions traditional values, values and conclusions
 budhguptah vaah aryabhat! vaah! Science fiction: a new type of story-telling started to be written thinking what can happen with new discoveries and new techniques
 inhen ‘vigyaan galp’ arthath ‘science fiction’ yaa vigyaan-kathaayen kaha gaya
 Thus understand that the 'art of story' is the shell of torch and the battery is 'science'
 jab donon mil jate hai to ‘science fiction’ yaa vigyaan galp kaa prakaash paidaa hota he
 It is necessary to have dual abilities in science fiction writer
 ek ore to uske paas samvedansheel sahityakar kaa hriday hona chahie or duusari ore use vigyaan kii jaankaree bhi honi chahie
 If there is not enough knowledge of science, the narrative will be based only on fictitious facts
 us katha main tathaa kisi pariktha athwa tilism-katha main antar nahin rah jayega
 If there is no knowledge of literature, there will be no literary sensibility and only an attempt will be made to store scientific information in the form of fiction, then that quantity will be a compilation of scientific facts
 isliye is antar ko saaf or bahut gaharaai se anubhav kiya janaa chahie
 Knowledge of story form and its limitations is necessary to write science fiction because science fiction also applies the same rules of literary story and novel
 kathanak, paatr or unka charitra chithran, bhashaa-style or uddeshy katha ke pramukh tatv hai
 While writing science fiction it must be kept in mind that it should be a 'fiction', not a scientific article written in an interesting style
 isliye is kshetra main lekhan kii badi sambhaavnaaen hai
 Jules Vern, H
 G
 Wells, Isaac Asimov, Arthur Clarke, Ray Bradbury, etc
 are many famous foreign science fiction writers
