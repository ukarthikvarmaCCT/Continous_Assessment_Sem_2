 Under Malan, apartheid policies against blacks and in favor of Shwetangs were legalized and institutionalized
 naishanal party africaner samoohon or guton kaa ek gathjod thi jiskaa makasad goron kii nasli shreshthata ke dambh par aadhaarit nasli bhedbhaav ke kaarykram par amal karnaa tha
 The slogans given by Malan during the election gave the aparthide meaning of apartheid

 Apartheid then dominated the political, social and economic life of South Africa for the next half century

 Apartheid came to an end in the nineties with the establishment of democratic rule of majority blacks under the leadership of the African National Congress and Nelson Mandela
 dakshin africa ke sandarbh main nasli bhedbhaav kaa itihaas bahut purana he
 It begins with Dutch colonists establishing Cap Town as their refreshment station

 At the same time, Europeans living among the African population of the region began to see themselves as rulers of black Africans
 shaskaon or shasiton ke bich shreshthata or nimnata kaa bhed karne ke liye kaalon ko europiyanon se haath bhar dur rakhane kaa aagrah panapana zaruri tha
 The paradox of the situation was that blacks also had an intimate presence in the lives of white European owners

 They had to pay tax on the dynamite used in mining
 kruger kaa yah bhi maananaa tha ki in videshi khan maalikon or unke khanij campon ke pradooshan se boar samaaj ko bachaaya janaa chahie
 On the other hand, Cecil Rhodes, who invested in mining and had been the Prime Minister of Cap Colony and his allies, aimed to expand British influence
 is pratiyogita ke garbh se jo yuddh niklaa use boar waar ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The two sides of this war, which continued from 1899 to 1902, were pro-apartheid Europeans, but black soldiers were being filled as fodder in the cannons of both sides

 It was Vervoord who created the legal framework on which the crown of the apartheid state emerged

 With the ruling of the National Party committed to apartheid in 1948, the ANC entered into an alliance with the Indian Congress, the Colored People's Congress and the White Congress of Damocrates

 In the early stages, or with self-realization, architecture takes place in the occupations, or occupations necessary for the limited purposes of humans — often to provide some kind of defense for humans

 In ancient times architecture was said to be the mother of all arts
 kintu vritti ke parivartan ke saath or sambhddha vyavsaayon ke bhaag lene par yah samaveshak sangrakshan kii muhar ab nahin rahi
 Architecture is also said to bring to light the social status of the ancient period
 yah vahiin tak thik he jahaan tak saamaajik evam anya uplabdhiyon kaa prabhaav he
 It has also been said that architecture is nothing more than ornamentation of buildings
 jahaan tak aitihaasik vaastukala kaa sambandh he, yah anshat: satya he
 Then architecture is also called the mold of civilization

 In these primitive endeavors and in their improved forms, some things are so important and distinctive in all the countries that they are evident even in the greatest art works of a long time later

 The plain form of Egypt, the standard design of China, the exotic and rich nature of India, the majestic majesty of Maya and Aztec of Mexico, the highly developed devotionals of Greece, the complex types of buildings that served the multiple needs of the Roman Empire, the ancient marched churches
 , The Great Gothic Church Building and Chitropam Fort, the excellent configuration and proportions of Turkish buildings and the grand architecture of European revival Numeric monuments present an account of the continuous development of historical architecture
 ye sab imaaraten maanav vikaas ke mahaan yugon kii ore ingit karti hai, jinamein vaastukala jaateey jivan se atyadhik sambandhit hone ke kaaran un jatiyon kii pratibha or mahatvakanksha kaa, jinaki unke smarakon par suspasht chhap hai, digdarshan karaati hai
 The achievements of each historical architecture can be broadly determined by two fundamental principles, one which is embedded in the concept and the other which signifies supreme uniqueness
 misri vaastu main yah yugottarajive vishaal or baari smarakon dwaara vyakt rahasyamyata he, asyrian, babinloni or irani kala main, yah shastrshakti or vilaasi jivan tha, unani kala main yah nishchayatmak aayojana or sanshodhit drushtibhram tha jiske falswaroop saadagi or parishkrut purnataa ai
 It was the love of grandeur, enjoyment and power among the Romans that resulted in a unique scientific creation
 purakalin isaayiyon main yah isamsih kii sachhee saadagi or gaurav vyakt karanevaale girjagharon ke nirmaan ke prati baari utsaah ke rup main tha; gothic nirmaataaon main yah sanrachana yantriki ke gyaan se yukt utkar shakti thi; italvi punaruddhar main yah us yug kii vidvatta thi
 The outstanding quality of Buddhist and Hindu architecture is its metaphysics, which is evident in its development
 musalamaani vaastukala main acolpaneey dhan sampada, thaat or vishaal bhukhand par uskaa prabhutv jhalkata he; jabaki bharat kaa bhimkaay afgani vaastu us shashan kii aakraamak pravriti prakat karata he; kintu mughal smarak utkrisht anupaat mughalon ke or kriti sambandhi prem ko darshane main shreshth hai tathaa bharat kii garmi main unka jivan bhaleebhanti vyakt karte hai
 Thus in the past works we see that the rock, bricks and stones are the only ideas which express the above and reliably, in some way or the other, the religious or other awakening of civilizations that have reached the pinnacle of glory
 in tamaam saalon main vaastukala samayik chetana paryaavaran tathaa sthaneey prishthbhumi ke saamanjasy main viksit hui
 Even today, we keep looking for the most suitable forms for talented people

 There are very few who are trying to develop Vastu according to their time, pace and national vision
 is chote se varg kaa prayaas nayaa sanghaat prastut karne kaa he, jo manushya kaa nae vichaar sochane or dhaaran karne kii prerana detaa he
 In this way we try to build buildings of our era and later these buildings will build caste by encouraging healthy development of body and brain
 iske atirikt ham dekhte hai ki vaastukala kabhi kabhi gyaat upyogita sambandhi aavashyaktaaon or uski nirmaan paddatiyon se aage bhi bad jaati he
 In architecture itself, a pure creation of imagination, when expressed with a wide barrage of all perspectives, is able to reach the pinnacle of perfection, such as Athena with the head of juice in Greece, or the simile of Swayambhu in India
 isamen andeh nahin ki vaastukala kaa aadhaar imaaraten hai, kintu yah imaaraten khadi karne ke atirikt kuch or bhi hai jaise kavita gadhy rachana ke rachana ke atirikt kuch or bhi he
 Poetry is impressive when sung in a sweet tone, but when it is accompanied by appropriate music and rhythmic dance efforts, it not only attracts the human heart and the different senses, but also the whole atmosphere created by their glorious combination
 She makes him aware
 isi prakaar vaastukalpanaayen, darshanik gatividhiyon se, kavyamay abhivyaktiyon se or sammilit layaatmak, sangitatmak tathaa varnatmak arthon se paripurna hoti hai or aisi utkrisht vaastukritiyaan maanav ke antarmanas ko chooti hui sabhi prakaar se uski prashansa kaa paatr hoti hai or phir vishwavyaapee khyaati arjeet karti hai
 This commendation of unanimous great objects is everlasting and inspires future generations
 yah satya he ki vaastukala ke prayogon main bahut asthirataa rahi he, jisase aganit sheliyaan prakat ho gai hai
 But what purpose does any of those styles have? Or what is their relation to his era? The truth is that architecture is neither a creed nor a style, but it is an inexhaustible sequence of development
 isliye vaastu ko shaileyon se vishesh prayojan nahin, jaise badalte hue fishan se kisi mahila kii poshaak kaa koi sambandh nahin
 In this subject, Frank Lloyd Wright has said that the periphery of architecture keeps on moving here and there, its center does not change
 aadhunik vaastukala kaa or vyapak arthon main, vaastukala kaa vikaas vinyas kii sanrachanaatmak aavashyaktaaon or uplabdh saamagree kii saundaryasambhaavnaaon dwaara prastut pratibandhon kii upasthiti main sundarataa ke liye khoj or sangharsh ke falswaroop hua he
 When a creation of a creation results in them, then it seems that today's architecture is a sculpture expressed in the form of heavy compositions and frequencies
 yadi is sandarbh main dekhe to vaastukala vyakti ke apane sarjak man kii sampurna evam suviksit rachana honi chahie, jo swayambhu ke ucch str tak pahunchati he

 There are mainly two branches of this science: pranivigyaan, jisamen jantuon kaa adhyayan hota he or Botany or phytology, which studies plants
 saamaanya arth main jeevadhariyon ko do pramukh virgon - praaniyon or padpon - main vibhakt kiya gaya he
 The two have many similarities
 donon kii sharir rachanaayen koshikaon or utakon se bani hai
 There is a great similarity in the life of both
 unka janan bhi saadrishy he
 Their respiration is also about the same
 padap praaniyon se kuch maamalon main bhinn bhi hote hai
 For example, plants have a green substance called foliage, which is not found in animals
 padpon kii koshika bhitiyaan mukhyatah celulose naamak carbohydrate kii bani hoti hai, jabaki praaniyon main koshika bhitiyaan saamanytah paayi hi nahin jaatin
 Most plants do not have movement, which are capable of walking
 vanaspatiyaan dharti par jivan ke moolbhoot ansh hai
 Vegetables release oxygen
 maanav evam anya jantuon kaa bhojan unase hi miltaa he
 Fibers provide fuel, fuel, medicines

 berlin kii diwaar pashchimi berlin or german loktantric ganraajya ke bich ek avrodh thi jisane 28 saal tak berlin shahar ko purvi or pashchimi tukdon main vibhajit karke rakhaa
 Its construction began on 13 August 1961 and was disbanded in the weeks following 9 November 1989
 berlin kii diwaar andaruni german seemaa kaa sabase pramukh bhaag thi or sheet yuddh kaa pramukh pratik thi
 When Germany was partitioned after World War II, hundreds of artisans and businessmen left East Berlin and moved to West Berlin every day
 bahut se log rajnatik kaarnon se bhi samaajawaadee purvi germany ko chhodkar poonjeewaadi pashchimi germany jane lage 
 This caused much damage to East Germany economically and politically
 berlin diwaar kaa uddeshy isi pravaasana ko rokna tha
 The idea of this wall was conceived by the administration of Walter Ulbricht and approved by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev
 berlin kii diwaar banane se yah pravaas bahut kam ho gaya - 1949 or 1962 ke bich main jahaan 25 lakh logon ne pravaas kiya vahiin 1962 or 1989 ke bich keval 5,000 logon ne
 But the construction of this wall proved to be very bad for the propaganda system of the socialist group
 pashchim ke logon ke liye yah samaajawaadee atyaachaar kaa pratik ban gai, khaas taur par jab bahut se logon ko seemaa paar karte hue goli maar di gai
 Many people have found unique ways to cross the border - by building tunnels, by hot air balloons, sliding over wires passing over walls, or breaking road barriers with high speed vehicles
 1980 ke dashak main soviet aadhipaty ke patan hone se purvi germany main rajnatik udaarikaran shuru hua or seemaa niyamon ko dhilaa kiya gaya
 This led to many demonstrations in East Germany and eventually led to the collapse of the government
 9 navambar 1989 ko ghoshnaa kii gai ki seemaa par avaagaman par se roak hataa di gai he
 Large groups of people from both East and West Berlin met each other after crossing the Berlin Wall
 agle kuch saptahon main ullas kaa maahaul rahaa or log dhire-dhire diwaar ke tukade todakar yaadgaar ke liye le gaye
 Later it was demolished using large equipment
 berlin diwaar ke girane se puure germany main rashtrawaad kaa udai hua or purvi germany ke logon ne germany ke punarekikaran ke liye manjuuri de di
 Germany reunited on 3 October 1990
 kii shrenee kaa hissaa Theravada or Sthavarism is one of the two major branches of Buddhism in the present day
 duusari shakha kaa naam mahayan he
 Theravada Buddhism started from India and spread to many other Asian countries towards south and southeast, such as Sri Lanka, Burma, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and Laos
 yah ek roodhiwaadee parampara he, arthath pracheen buddha dharm jaisaa tha, usee maarg par chalane par bal detaa he
 The word 'theravada' means 'talk of the noblest'
 buddha dharm kii is shakha main pali bhashaa main likhe hue pracheen tripitak dharmik granthon kaa paalan karne par bal diya jaataa he
 Theravada followers say that they believe Buddhism as its core
 inke liye mahatma buddha ek mahapurush avashya hai lekin koi devtaa nahin
 They do not worship them nor do Buddha-worship occur in their religious ceremonies
 jahaan mahayan buddha paramparaon main devi-devataaon jaise bahut se divya jeevon ko mana jaataa he vahaan therwaad buddha paramparaon main aisi kisi hasti ko nahin puja jaataa
 The Theravists believe that every human being has to find the path of nirvana by himself
 in samudaayon main yuvakon ke bhikshuk banane ko bahut shubh mana jaataa he or yahan yah rivaayat bhi he ki yuvak kuch dinon ke liye bhikshu banakar phir grihasth main laut jaataa he
 Earlier 'theravada' was called 'hinayana branch', but now many scholars say that these two are different
 mahayan buddha dharm ke anuyaayi kehete hai ki adhiktar manushyon ke liye nirvana-maarg akele dhundhna mushkil yaa asambhav he or unhen is kaary main sahaayta milani chahie
 They understand that all beings in the universe are connected to each other and it is necessary to love everyone and strive for the nirvana of all
 kisi bhi praani ke liye dushbhaavna nahin rakhni chahie kyonki sabhi janm-mrityu ke janjaal main fanse hai
 An assassin or a petty creature can be its own born again ancestor, so they should also be helped
 prerana or sahaayta ke liye bodhisattvon ko mana jaataa he jo ve praani hai jo nirvana paa chuke hai
 Thousands of such Bodhisattvas are worshiped in the Mahayana branch and they have deity-like status in this sect
 in bodhisattvon main kuch bahut prasiddh hai, udhaaharan ke liye awalokiteshwar, amitabh, maitrey, manjushri or kshitigarbha
 The Mahayana branch is practiced in North Asian regions, such as China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Tibet, Bhutan, Mongolia and Singapore
 mahayan sampradaay ki aage or upashakhaayen hai, masalan zen / chaan, pavitra bhoomi, tiyantai, nichiren, shingon, tendai or tibeti buddha dharm
 People from different countries of the world are followers of Theravada, the main ones are- fr nakhon si ayuthya thailand kaa ek praant he
 It is located in the central Thailand region
 "ayuthya" shabd ramayana kii ayodhya nagari kaa thai rup he or "si" shabd shri kaa rup he
 Similarly "nakhon" is the form of "city" of Sanskrit
 "fr" shabd thai main sanskrit ke "dev" shabd kaa rup he
 That means "fr Nakhon Si Ayutthaya" means "dev Nagri Sri Ayodhya"
 patan kaa arth hota he neeche girnaa
 It is the opposite word of uplift
 yah praayah kisi vastu yaa vyakti ke sandarbh main prayukt hota he
 In the context of the individual, it is used for morality
 kisi samrajya yaa adhipaty kaa patan bhi praayah prayukt hota he

 Subuktigin was his slave
 jab alp tigin ne samaani shaskaon ke khilaaf vidroh kiya jo usne subuktigin ko gazani kaa prabharee bana diya or apni beti kii shaadi usase kar di
 Subuktigin also saw the administration as a slave within the two successors of Alaptigin and in 977 he became the Sultan of Ghazni

 The geological history of the Earth is based on the study of the levels of its rocks
 prithvi kaa nirmaan lagbhag 4
54 billian varsh purv hua
 Initially, the Earth was a rocky, hot and desolate planet whose atmosphere was sparse, composed of hydrogen and helium
 aaj se 460 karod saalon ke dauraan is grah par jivan kaa vikaas hua
 Earth's structure is flaky
 vayumandal ke bahari chor se prithvi ke crode tak jo padaarth hai ve ek samaan nahin hai
 The density of atmospheric material is the lowest
 prithvi kii sataha se iske bhitari bhaag tak anek mandal hai or har ek bhaag ke padaarth kii alag visheshtaayen hai
 How did the Earth's flaky structure develop? grhanu va duusare khagoleey pind zyaadaatar ek jaise hi ghaney or halke padaarthon ke mishran se bane hai
 We get to know this by studying meteors
 bahut se grhanuon ke ikattha hone se grah bane
 The earth has also been created according to this process
 jab padaarth gurutvabal ke kaaran sanhat ho rahaa tha, to un ikattha hote pindon ne padaarth ko prabhavit kiya
 This caused excessive heat
 yah kriya jari rahi or utpann taap se padaarth pighalane / galane laga
 This happened during the origin of the Earth and soon after its origin
 atyadhki taap ke kaaran, prithvi aanshik rup se drav avasthaa main rah gai or taapmaana kii adhikta ke kaaran hi halke or baari ghanatv ke mishran vaale padaarth ghanatv ke antar ke kaaran alag hona shuru ho gaye
 Due to this separation, heavy materials moved into the center of the earth and light materials came towards the surface or upper part of the earth
 samay ke saath yah or thande hue or thos rup main parivartit hokar chote aakaar ke ho gaye
 Eventually it developed into the earth's crust
 halke va baari ghanatv vaale padaarthon ke pruthak hone kii is prakriya ko vibhedan kaha jaataa he
 During the Moon's birth, due to the horrific impact, the temperature of the Earth rose again or produced energy and this was the second phase of differentiation
 vibhedan kii is prakriya dwaara prithvi kaa padaarth anek paraton main alag ho gaya
 Many layers are found from the earth's surface to the core
 jaise: parpati, praavaar, bahya crode or aantarik crode 
 The density of matter increases from the upper part of the earth to the interior
 prithvi ke vayumandal kii vartmaan sanrachana main nitrogen evam oxigen kaa pramukh yogadan he
 There are three stages of development of the present atmosphere
 isaki pehali avasthaa main adikalik vayumandaleey gaison kaa hraas he
 In the second stage, water and water vapor from within the earth contributed to the development of the atmosphere
 ant main vayumandal kii sanrachana ko jaev mandal ke prakaash sanshleshan prakriya ne sanshodhit kiya
 The early atmosphere had an excess of hydrogen and helium and it broke away from the Earth due to solar wind
 aisa keval prithvi par hi nahin, varan sabhi parthiv grahon par hua
 That is, due to the effect of solar wind from all the earth planets, the primordial atmosphere was either pushed away or dissipated
 yah vayumandal ke vikaas kii pehali avasthaa thi
 During the cooling and differentiation of the earth, many gases and water vapor came out from the inner part of the earth
 isi se aaj ke vayumandal kaa udbhav hua
 Initially the atmosphere had very high amounts of water vapor, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane and ammonia, and independent oxygen
 vah prakriya jisase prithvi ke bhitari bhaag se gaisen dharti par ain, ise gas utsarjan kaha jaataa he
 Continuous volcanic eruptions led to the rise of water vapor and gas in the atmosphere
 prithvi ke thanda hone ke saath-saath jalawaashp kaa sanghanan shuru ho gaya
 The dissolution of carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere in rainwater caused a further drop in temperature
 falswaroop adhik sanghanan va atyadhki varsha hui
 On the surface of the earth, rainwater started collecting in the troughs, which would form oceans
 prithvi par upasthit mahaasaagar prithvi kii utpatti se lagbhag 50 karod saalon ke antargat bane
 That is, the oceans are 400 million years old
 lagbhag 380 karod saal pehle jivan kaa vikaas aarambh hua
 Although the photosynthesis process evolved about 250 to 300 million years ago
 lambey samay tak jivan keval mahasaagaron tak simit rahaa
 The increase in oxygen by the process of photosynthesis is the creation of oceans
 dhire-dhire mahaasaagar oxigen se santrupt ho gaye or vayumandal main oxigen kii maatra 200 karod varsh purv purna rup se bhar gai
 The final phase of the origin of the Earth is related to the origin and development of life
 nihsandeh prithvi kaa aarambhik vayumandal jivan ke vikaas ke liye anukool nahin tha
 Modern scientists describe the origin of life as a kind of chemical reaction, which first formed and grouped complex biomolecules
 yah samoohan aisa tha jo apane aapako doharaata tha
 , And could convert inanimate matter into living matter
 hamaare grah par jivan ke chihn alag-alag samay kii chattaanon main paae jane vaale jeevashm ke rup main hai
 The microstructure found in 300 million years old geological rocks is similar to the structure of today's algae
 yah kalpana kii ja sakati he ki isse pehle samay main sadhran sanrachana vaali shaiwal rahi hogi
 It is believed that the development of life began about 380 crore years ago

 More than a hundred years later, in 1802, Woolaston demonstrated that there are black lines in the solar spectrum
 unhone surya ke prakaash ke ek sankeern kiranpunj ko ek chhidr main se andhere kaksh main pravisht karakar prism dwaara dekha
 He saw that this raypanj was divided into four colors by black lines
 yah bhi dekha ki ek mombatti kii jwaala ke nichle bhaag ke nile prakaash ko ek prism ke dwaara dekhne par bahut se chamkile pratibimb dikhaai padate hai, jinamein se ek or spectrum ke nile or bangnee rangon ke bich kii kaali rekha kaa sampati hota he
 Later in 1814, Fraunhofer made a detailed examination of black lines with a farsighted and narrow line of sight and they could count up to 574 black lines in the spectrum
 unhone unamem se kuch pramukh rekhaon kaa naam A, a, B, C, D, E, b ityadi diya jo aaj bhi prachlit hai
 He also observed that the lines in the solar spectrum coincide with the black lines seen in the spectrum of the flame of the lamp

 This important suggestion was used by Higgin to use Kitchoff's discoveries in the study of the stellar spectrum

 main locoyar ne sarvapratham pradarshit kiya ki ek tatv ek se adhik vishisht spectrum utsarjit parmaanu ke upar prayukt uddipan par nirbhar karata he
 When Lockyer used the more powerful scattering method after the arc to excite the spectrum, the spectrum lines that became more intense were called enhanced lines
 ye yah pradarshit karanevaale pratham vyakti the ki surya ke varnmandal kaa spectrum mandalak or suryakalank ke spectrum se bhinn he or isse nishkarsh nikaala ki prakashmandal ke taap kii apeksha varnmandal kaa taap adhik or suryakalankon kaa taap kam hota he
 Lockyer made it known that the stripe sequence appears in the flame spectrum of compounds
 ye pattiyaan ghatak parmaanuon dwaara praapt rekhil spectrum se bhinn hoti hai
 But when the temperature was increased, the strips disappeared and a linear spectrum of constituent elements appeared
 is prekshan se locoyar ne yah tark prastut kiya ki sphuling spectrum main tatwon kii vardhit rekhaayen saadhaaran tatwon ke viyojan se praapt honevaale protoeliment ke kaaran hoti hai
 Thus today's known pinkering class due to ionized helium atom is called proto hydrogen spectrum
 aaj ham jaanate hai ki ye protoeliment maatra ve hi tatv hai jinke paramanu ynit ho gaye hai
 Lockyer observed several wires and concluded that they exhibit different types of spectrum only because their temperatures are different
 san 1921 tak yah vivekpurna suzav upekshit hi rahaa jab tak ki saaha ne spectrum anukram ke bare main sahi vyakhya nahin kii
 According to them, the reason for the difference of wires is not their internal chemical composition but the difference of their temperature and pressure

 The Sun is the nearest and brightest star on Earth, which exhibits observational circles
 yah swaabhaavik he ki taron ke satat spectrum siddhant kii jaanch surya ke upar iske anuprayog dwaara kii jaae
 Observation of the intensity distribution above the solar system has been done not only in the integrated light but also in monochromatic light of different wavelengths
 yah paaya gaya ki ang tak pahunchan par tivrata ghat jaati he or angatmisran kii ghatana deergh tarangadairghy kii apeksha laghu tarangadairghy main adhik spasht hoti he
 Schuster, while interpreting this observed confinement, assumed that the light radiates uniformly in all directions and that the gaseous circles around it absorb and emit at all frequencies
 yah maanakar ki gasiy parimandal nichle prakaashiya mandal kii apeksha thandha he, shuster ne ek saidhantik niyam kaa pratipaadan kiya or is siddhant kii prekshanon se tulana kii
 The credit for understanding the importance of radiative equilibrium in the stellar circle is to Schwart's Child, who was able to show that observations correlate more with radiative equilibrium than with temperate equilibrium

 To test the validity of the fourth approximation, detailed calculations of absorption coefficients were performed by Macri, Bearman, Unsald, Pennycock, and others
 in logon ne apane pariklan main rasel dwaara nirdhaarit surya ke rasinic sanghathan kaa upyog kiya
 These calculations were used to form the curve of intensity distribution at different effective temperatures and many scientists compared these to observations of the continuous spectrum of the Sun and stars

 In 1939, Wilt found that negative hydrogen could be the cause of the negative absorption of solar stars, consisting of one proton and two electrons
 in yanon ke vinyas kii sthirataa aarambh main hi sthapit ho chuki thi
 It soon became known that the value of negative hydrogen ion as a source of continuous absorption increases below 10,000 degrees and prevails at 6,000 degrees

 The frosty gaseous system that surrounds the lighthouse makes a gradual absorption of the radiation emitted from the lighthouse, resulting in absorption lines
 sarvapratham shuster ne taarakeey spectrumon main avasorana rekhaon kaa krambaddh siddhant prastut kiya
 He attributed the formation of these lines to the absorption of spectrum lines superimposed on the saint scattering

 The credit for introducing modern astronomical spectrometry is attributed to Unsold, who made special photometric measurements of the circumference of sodium lines found above the solar system in relation to the theory of radiative transfer developed by Schwartschild and the quantum theory of linear absorption
 And tried to get the electron pressure and at least fraction of the solar system: chemical Explored Ngtn

 In 1929, Eddington published an essay on the formation of absorption lines, in which the method of the formation of stellar absorption lines was explained
 iske anusaar in rekhaon ke banane main prakirnan or avasorana kaa samaan rup se haath se haath rahata he
 Thus scattering and absorption occur at all levels of the circle
 in rekhaon ke banane kaa kaaran yah he ki rekha ke sameep avasorana bahut adhik hota he
 In the following years Eddington's theory was reformed and expanded by Milne, Wulli, Pennycock, Unsold and Chandrasekhar
