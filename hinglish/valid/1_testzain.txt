 is siddhanth ke dwaara buddhi kii avadharana ko or adhik shuddhta se paribhaashit kiya gaya he or yah dekhne kii koshish kii gayi he ki buddhi ko maapne ke liye pehle se maujuud siddhanth kis seemaa tak vaigyanik hai
 According to Gardner's multiple-genius theory, the definition of conventionally defined intelligence is too narrow and does not properly represent the variety of abilities in humans
 iske anusaar, vah baccha jo aasaani se pahaada yaad kar letaa he jaruri nahin ki duusare bachche se adhik pratibhashali ho jise pahaada yaad karne main kathinaayee hoti he
 Maybe the other child is more intelligent in some other kind of intelligence
 aisa bhi sambhav he ki vah baccha guna kii prakriya bilkul hi alag bhang se dekhtaa ho jiske kaaran uski pragadh ganitiya buddhi kaa kisi ko andaaj na mil paa rahaa ho
 Gardner opines that each person has seven types of talent
 kisi vyakti main do yaa adhik pradhan pratibhaaen ho sakati hai or kuch log aise hote hai jinamein saat pratibhaaen santulit rup se hoti hai
 Howard Gardner initially put seven talents in form
 unki suchi asthaayee thi
 The first two are given special importance in schools, the next three are usually associated with art, and the last two are what Howard Gardner called 'individual talent'

 They have to change their bad way of living 


 They must be educated 


 a great need is to shake their sense of inferiority and to instill in them the divine dissatisfaction which is the source of all heights
 ambedkar ne congress or gandhi dwaara chalaaye gayi namak satyagrah kii aalochana kii
 Due to the increasing popularity and public support among his untouchable community, he was also invited to attend the second round table conference in London in 1931
 vahaan unki achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene ke mudde par gandhi se tikhi bahes hui
 But Brido agreed with Ambedkar's ideas
 dharm or jati ke aadhaar par pruthak nirvaachika dene ke prabal virdohi gandhi ne ashanka jataai, ki achhuton ko di gayi pruthak nirvaachika, hindu samaaj ko vibhajit kar degi
 Gandhi felt that the Savarnas should be given some period of their heart-rending to forget untouchability, but this argument was proved wrong when untouchability continued to be practiced by the upper-caste Hindus even decades after the Poona Pact
 1932 main jab britishon ne ambedkar ke vichaaron ke saath sahmati vyakt karte huye achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene kii ghoshnaa kii

 Under this, Dalits could choose their representative by one vote and by another vote, there was freedom to choose representative of general class
 is prakaar dalit pratinidhi keval daliton kii hi vot se chunaa janaa tha
 With this provision, there was no longer any interference from the general class in choosing the Dalit representative
 lekin vahiin dalit varg apni duusari vot kaa istemaal karte hue saamaanya varg ke pratinidhi ko chunane se apni bhoomika nibhaa saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the Dalit candidate chosen by the Dalits could have kept the problems of Dalits well, but it was not necessary for the non-candidate to try to solve their problems
 gandhi is samay puna kii yeravada jail main the
 As soon as the announcement of the communal award, Gandhi first wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and demanded that it be changed
 lekin jab unako laga ki unki maang par koi amal nahin kiya ja rahaa he to unhone maran vrath rakhane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Then Ambedkar said that "if Gandhi had kept this fast for the freedom of the country, it would have been good, but he has kept this fast in protest against the Dalit people, which is very regrettable
" jabaki bhartiya isaayiyo, musalamaanon or sikhon ko mili isi adhikaar ko lekar gandhi kii ore se koi aapatti nahin ai
 "he also said that Gandhi is not an immortal person
 bharat main na jane kitne aise logon ne janm liya or chale gaye
 Ambedkar said that he cannot renounce the interests of Dalits to save Gandhi's life
 ab maran vrath ke kaaran gandhi kii tabiyat lagaataar bigad rahi thi
 Gandhi's life was in great distress
 or puraa hindu samaaj ambedkar kaa virdohi ban gaya
 Seeing the increasing pressure in the country, Ambedkar reached Yerwada jail at 5 pm on 24 September 1932
 yahaan gandhi or ambedkar ke bich samjhauta hua, jo baad main puna pact ke naam se janaa gaya
 In this agreement, Ambedkar announced to waive the right to separate electorate received by the Dalits in the Communal Award
 lekin iske saath hin communal award se mili 78 arakshit siton kii bajaay puna pact main arakshit siton kii sankhya badha kar 148 karvaa lee
 Along with this, for the untouchables, adequate amount was allocated in education grant in every province and ensured the recruitment of Dalit people without any discrimination from government jobs and in this way Ambedkar saved the life of Mahatma Gandhi
 ambedkar is samjhaute se asamaadhani the, unhone gandhi ke is anshan ko achhuton ko unke raajnneetik adhikaron se vanchit karne or unhen unki maang se peeche hatane ke liye dawaab daalane ke liye gandhi dwaara khelaa gaya ek naatak qaraar diya

 He thought that Muslims could have no objection to retaking the provincial boundaries
 agar unhone kiya, to ve kaaphi "apni maang kii prakruti ko samaj nahin paae"
 Scholar Venkat Dhalipal said that Thoughts on Pakistan "stopped Indian politics for a decade"
 isane muslim lig or bhartiya rashtriya congress ke bich samvaad ke paathyakram ko nirdhaarit kiya, jo bharat ke vibhaajan ke liye rasta tay kar rahaa tha
 Although he was a staunch critic of the divisive communal strategy of Mohammad Ali Jinnah and the Muslim League, he argued that Hindus and Muslims should be separated and Pakistan should be formed because to lead the same country, due to ethnic nationalism More violence will develop within the country
 unhone hindu or musalamaanon ke sampradayik vibhaajan ke bare main apane vichaar ke paksh me automon samrajya or checkoslovakia ke vighatan jaisi aitihaasik ghatnaon kaa ullekh kiya
 He asked whether sufficient reasons existed for the establishment of Pakistan? And suggested that differences between Hindus and Muslims might have been possible to eradicate even with a less drastic step
 unhone likhaa he ki pakistan ko apane astitv kaa auchity siddh karnaa chaiye
 Communal issues have always been there even in countries like Canada, but even today the British and French live together, so can't Hindus and Muslims also live together
 unhone chetaya ki do desh banane ke samaadhaan kaa vaastavik kriyanvayan atyant kathinaayee bharaa hoga
 With the transfer of large population, there will also be a problem of border dispute
 bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad hone vaali hinsa ko dhyaan main rakh kar kii gai yah bhavishyavaanee sahi thi

 unhone bharat vibhaajan kaa to paksh liya par muslimo main vyaapt bal vivaah kii pratha or mahilaon ke saath hone vaale durvyavhaar kii ghor ninda kii
 They said, bahuvivaah or rakhel rakhane ke dushprinaam shabdon main vyakt nahin kiye ja sakate jo vishesh rup se ek muslim mahila ke dukh ke strot hai
 Take the caste system itself, everyone says that Islam should be free from slavery and caste, while slavery exists and got support from Islam and Islamic countries
 jabaki quran main nihit gulaamon ke nyaay or maanviya upachaar ke bare main paigambar dwaara kiye gaye nuskhe prashansaneey hai, islam main aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo is abhishaap ke unmoolan kaa samarthan karata ho
 Even if slavery ends, caste system will remain among the Muslims
 unhone likhaa ki muslim samaaj me to hindu samaaj se bhi kahi adhik saamaajik buraaiyaan he or musalmaan unhen " bhaichaare " jaise naram shabdon ke prayog se chhupate hai
 He also criticized the oppressive curtain practice of oppression of women in Muslim society as well as the discrimination against the Arzal classes by Muslims who were considered "lower class"

 He criticized bigotry in Islam due to which the society has become very fanatical due to the lack of literate adherence to the laws of Islam and it is very difficult to change it
 unhone aage likhaa ki bhartiya musalmaan apane samaaj kaa sudhaar karne main vifal rahe hai jabaki iske vipareet turki jaise deshon ne apane aapako bahut badal liya he
 Both Hindu and Muslim groups suffering from "communalism" have ignored the demand for social justice
 10-12 saal hindu dharm ke antargat rahete hue babasahab ambedkar ne hindu dharm tathaa hindu samaaj ko sudhaarney, samta tathaa sammaan praapt karne ke liye tamaam praytn kiye, parantu savarna hinduon kaa hryday parivartan na hua
 On the contrary, he was condemned and even called the destroyer of Hindu religion
 useke baad unhone kaha tha kii, “hamane hindu samaaj main samanta kaa str praapt karne ke liye har tarah ke praytn or satyagrah kiye, parantu sab nirarthak siddh hue
 There is no place for equality in Hindu society
 ” hindu samaaj kaa yah kahana tha ki “manushya dharm ke liye hai” jabaki ambedkar kaa maananaa tha ki "dharm manushya ke liye hai
 "ambedkar said that such a religion has no meaning in which humanity has no value whatsoever
 jo apane hi dharm ke anuyaayion ko dharm shiksha praapt nahin karne detaa, naukari karne main baadha pahunchaata he, baat-baat par apamaanit karata he or yahan tak ki pani tak nahin milane detaa aise dharm main rahane kaa koi matlab nahin
 Ambedkar did not declare any renunciation of Hinduism for any kind of enmity and destruction of Hinduism, but he decided it with some fundamental principles which were not in sync with Hinduism
 13 oktober 1935 ko nasik ke nikat yevala main ek sammelan main bolte hue ambedkar ne dharm parivartan karne kii ghoshnaa kii, "although i am born as an untouchable Hindu, i will not die as a Hindu at all!" unhone apane anuyaayiyon se bhi hindu dharm chhod koi or dharm apnaane kaa aahvaan kiya
 He also reiterated this in several public meetings across India
 is dharm-parivartan kii ghoshnaa ke baad hyderabad ke islam dharm ke nizaam se lekar kai isai mishnariyon ne unhen karodon rupee kaa pralobhan bhi diya par unhonen sabhi ko thukraa diya
 Of course, he also wanted that the economic condition of the Dalit society should improve, but not by being dependent on the money, but by their hard work and organization
 iske alaava ambedkar aise dharm ko chunanaa chaahate the jiskaa kendra manushya or naitikta ho, usamen swatantraaa, samta tathaa bandhutav ho
 In any case, he did not want to adopt a religion which is riddled with apartheid and untouchability, nor did he want to choose a religion which has superstition and hypocrisy
 ambedkar ne dharm parivartan kii ghoshnaa karne ke baad 21 varsh tak ke samay ke bich unhone ne vishwa ke sabhi pramukh dharmon kaa gahan adhyayan kiya
 The main reason for his taking such a long time was that he wanted more and more followers to convert with him at the time he converted
 ambedkar buddha dharm ko pasand karte the kyonki usamen teen siddhanton kaa samanvit rup miltaa he jo kisi anya dharm main nahin miltaa
 Buddhism teaches wisdom, compassion and equity
 unka kahana tha ki manushya inhen baton ko shubh tathaa aanandit jivan ke liye chahta he
 God and soul cannot save society
 ambedkar ke anusaar sachcha dharm wo hi he jiskaa kendra manushya tathaa naitikta ho, vigyaan athwa bauddhik tatv par aadhaarit ho, na ki dharm kaa kendra ishwar, aatma kii mukti or moksh
 At the same time, he said that the work of religion should be to rebuild the world and not to explain its origin and end
 vah janatantric samaaj vyavastha ke pakshdhar the, kyonki unka maananaa tha aisi sthiti main dharm maanav jivan kaa maardarshak ban saktaa he
 He got all these things in the only Buddhism
 gandhi va congress kii katu aalochana ke baavjood ambedkar kii pratishtha ek adwitiya vidwaan or vidhivetta kii thi jiske kaaran jab, 15 agast 1947 main bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad, congress ke netritv vaali nai sarkaar astitv main ai to usne ambedkar ko desh ke pehle kaanoon evam nyaay mantri ke rup main seva karne ke liye aamantrit kiya, jise unhone sweekaar kar liya
 On 29 August 1947, Ambedkar was appointed to the post of Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution for the creation of the new Constitution of independent India
 is kaary main ambedkar kaa shuruaati buddha sangh ritiyon or anya buddha granthon kaa adhyayan bhi kaam aayaa
 Granville Austin described the Indian Constitution prepared by Ambedkar as 'the first and most important social document'
 'bharat ke adhikansh sanvaidhanik praavdhaan yaa to saamaajik kranti ke uddeshy ko aage badhaane yaa isaki uplabdhi ke liye jaruri sthitiyon kii sthapana karke is kranti ko badhaava dene ke prayaas main sidhe pahunche hai

 Ambedkar argued for comprehensive economic and social rights for women, and won the support of the assembly to introduce the system of reservation of jobs in civil services, schools and colleges for members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes, Which was affirmative action
 bharat ke saansadon ne in upayon ke madhyam se bharat kii niraashajanak kakshaon ke liye saamaajik-aarthik asamantaaon or avasaron kii kami ko khatm karne kii ummid kii
 The constitution was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 26 November 1949
 apane kaam ko puraa karne ke baad, bolte hue, ambedkar ne kaha: i feel that the constitution is practicable, it is flexible but it is also strong enough to keep the country united during both peace and war
 vastav main, main kah saktaa hoon ki agar kabhi kuch galat hua to iskaa kaaran yah nahi hoga ki hamaara samvidhan kharaab tha balki iskaa upyog karne vaala manushya adham tha
 Ambedkar opposed Article 370 of the Constitution of India, which gave special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, and which was included in the constitution against his wishes
 balraj madhok ne kaha tha ki, ambedkar ne kashmiri netaa shaikh abdulla ko spasht rup se bataaya tha: "aap chaahate hai ki bharat ko aapaki simaaon kii raksha kerani chahie, use aapke kshetra main sadakon kaa nirmaan karnaa chahie, use aapako anaaj kii aapurti kerani chahie, or kashmir ko bharat ke samaan darja dena chahie
 But the Indian government should have only limited powers and the Indian people should not have any rights in Kashmir
 is prastaav ko sahmati dene ke liye, main bharat ke kanoon mantri ke rup main bharat ke hiton ke khilaaf ek vishwasghaatee baat hongi, yah kabhi nahin karegaa
 "then Abdullah approached Nehru, who directed him to Gopal Swami Iyengar, who in turn approached Vallabhbhai Patel and said that Nehru had promised Ske
 abdulla vishesh sthiti
 The passage was passed by Patel while Nehru was on a foreign tour
 jis din lekh charchaa ke liye aayaa tha, ambedkar ne is par sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin diya lekin anya lekhon par bhaag liya
 All arguments were made by Krishna Swami Iyengar
 main vyaktigat rup se samaj nahin paa rahaa hum ki kyon dharm ko is vishaal, vyapak kshetradhikaar ke rup main di jaani chahie taaki puure jivan ko cover kiya ja sake or us kshetra par atikaraman se vidhayika ko roak sake
