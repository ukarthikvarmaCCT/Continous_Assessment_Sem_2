mahakavi ko apane jivan main vibhinn prakaar ke anubhav hue the jinaki jhalak uni kritiyon main dikhaai padati he
 There is imagination in the pleasing plays of love, and the poet's mind is rich in luxury and youth
 du:khant naatakon main aise du:khad anubhavon ko abhivyakti he jo jivan ko vishakt bana dete hai
 Shakespeare's work has resulted in the creation of plays that have resulted in his perfect intelligence
 kavi ab apni vivekpurna drushti se dekhtaa he ki jivan main sukh or du:kha donon sannivisht rahete hai, at: daanon hi kshanik hai
 Both are embedded in grief in life, so both are transient
 jivan main du:kha ke baad sukh aata he, atev vichaar or vyavhaar main samatv vaanchhneeya he
 These final plays lead to the conclusion that mercy and forgiveness are more invulnerable than violence and vengeance
 apane gambhir naitik sandesh ke kaaran in naatakon kaa vishesh mahatv he
 Shakespeare's plays are Romantic and separate from the tradition of ancient Greek and Latin plays
 at: unamem vastuvinyas kii shastreey visheshtaon ko foondnaa uchit nahin he
 Only in his last play 'the Tempest' have he managed the three inventions
 praaia: sabhi anya naatakon main keval karyanviti kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya he, samay or sthaan kii drushti se ve nitant niabandh hai
 There is always enough detail in the plot and usually many stories are embedded in it
 udaahranarth ham e mid samar nits dream, di marchent aav venice, aiz you like it athwa king lier ko le sakate hai
 In all these, a mix of many stories has done the objective work
 kintu iskaa yah arth nahin he ki shakespeare ke naatakon kii banaavat trutipurna he
 The end-of-the-story storytelling is beautifully crafted, and there is a sense of unity collected from the entire plot
 shastreey arth main anvitiyon kaa abhaav hone par bhi in svachhndathawadi naatakon main bhavanatmak tathaa kalpanaatmak ekikaran hua he
 Shakespeare has more success in characterization
 apane naatakon main unhone anek aakarshak paatro kii sristi kii he jo apane jeevant rup main hamaare saamne aate hai
 Over time the process of characterization became more and more subtle and artistic
 udhaaharan ke liye ham sukhaant naatakon main samavisht rojalin, porcia, viartras, rojalind, vyla prabhruti pragalbha naariyon ko le sakate hai jo apni prakhar buddhi or vaakchaturi kaa parichay nirantar detii hai
 The second category are those women whose unique beauty and perilous experiences lead to compassion in the mind
 es naariyon main pramukh hai juliet, ophilia, desdymona, cardilia, imozen ityadi
 Characterization is highly important in sad plays
 udhaaharan ke liye ham hamelet ko le sakate hai
 All the events of the play are centered on the character of the protagonist and the development of the narrative is effected by his personality
 anshat: yahi baat anya du:khant naatakon ke liye bhi satya he
 Many memorable characters are found in ancient Greek plays, but Shakespeare's main characters, depicted using moral and psychological devices, are far more interesting and attractive
 aantarik dwandv ke upyog se du:khant naatakon kii patrakalpana or bhi adhik chamatkaarpurn ho gai he
 Some other characters in Shakespeare's plays are also notable such as clown and villain
 vidushakon main phalstaff tochastone, feste or king lier kaa swamibhakt vidooshak aadi mahatvapurn hai
 Villains include Richard III, Iago, Edmund Iyashi, etc
 jaisaa hazlit ne likhaa he, shakespeare kii shakti kaa pataa isse lagata he ki na keval unke mahatvapurn paatro main vaishishty he varan unke bahusankhyak laghu paatr bhi apana nijee mahatv rakhte hai
 Although prose is used elsewhere in Shakespeare's plays, they are still poetic in origin
 unka adhikansh bhaag chandobaddh he
 Not only this, almost all theatrical works are full of poetic qualities
 kalpana kaa prakaashan, alankarik abhivyakti, sangitatmak lay tathaa komal bhaawanaaon ke nirupan dwaara shakespeare ne manomuguakari prabhaav utpann kar diya he
 Since ancient times, plays were considered a mere distinction of poetry and Shakespeare accepted the ancient notion
 gadhy kaa prayog yada kada vishesh prayojan se hua he
 But in general we can call Shakespeare's plays poetic
 kavyatatv shuru main atyadhik tha kintu shanai: shanai: uskaa rup sanyat ho gaya or prayojan ke vichaar se uskaa niyantran hone laga
 Likewise, there was a constant effort to incorporate Shakespeare's style; As a result, early plays have an abundance of elaborate narratives and beautiful metaphors
 His style was balanced in his mature age by the time Shakespeare was composing his famous sorrowful plays
 praathmik avasthaa main abhivyakti kaa adhik mahatv tha or vichaaron kaa kam
 But in this secondary period, there is proper coordination of ideas, expressions and means of expression
 yah santulit vyavastha antim varshon main shakespeare kaa dhyaan vichaaron or naitik pratimaanon par kendrit tha or unhone shailigat chamatkaar kii upeksha kii
 That is why the style of the final plays has gone somewhere rough
 shakespeare ne apane naatak mukhyat: rangamanch par abhinay ke liye likhe the, yadhyapi kaavyatmak gunon ke kaaran ham unase pathan dwaara bhi anand praapt karte hai
 The arrangement of the acting of the erstwhile theater, the public interest of the audience, all influenced Shakespeare's theatrical production
 do ek udhaaharan hi paryaapt honge
 At that time dyed curtains were not used, so many descriptive pieces have been included in plays
 inhen varnanon dwaara sthaan, kaal or paristhiti kaa sanket hota tha
 The continuous use of the subject and self-talk in plays was possible because the next triangular part of the theater continued to spread among the observers
 kai purush or nari paatro kaa sarjan shakespeare ne keval isliye kiya ki unke upyukt abhinayta uplabdh the
 Many scenes have been opened for the entertainment of the audience, in which exciting and entertaining situations have been performed at the theater
 aaj ke yathartwaadee rangamanch kii bhanti elizveth yugin rangamanch prachur sadhano tathaa nishchit vyavastha dwaara bandhaa hua tha
 Both the acting and the performances were relatively free, so Shakespeare's plays have enough merit
 praaia: sabhi prakaar ke naatakon main mahakavi ne gey muktakon kaa sannivesh kiya he jo apane saundarya or maadhurya ke liye anupam hai
 Apart from these, there are elaborate poems of Shakespeare, in which 'vince and Adonis', 'the Rape of Lucreis' and Sanates are required to be mentioned
 ye sabhi kritiyaan 16 veen shatabdi ke antim dashak kii hai jab shakespeare kaa man saundarya evam pranay ke prabhaav se ahladaparn ho gaya tha
 An ancient love story has been described in a very poetic manner in 'vince and Adonis'
 'di rape ov lukris' main ek param sundari roman mahila ke durbhaagya or mrityu kii katha he
 There are some in the Sannets who are related to a friend of the poet who had decided not to marry
 shakespeare ne uske rup or gunon kii charchaa karte hue usase apana nishchay badalane ke liye aagrah kiya he
 The second order of the sennets is related to a Shyamvarna woman, who had developed intense attraction in the mind of the poet, but who did not respect the affection and gave her love to the friend of the poet, keeping in mind the first order of the sennets
 shakespeare ne in saneton main apni aantarik bhaawanaaon kaa prakaashan kiya he athwa ve paramparaagat rachanaayen maatr hai, yah prashn atyant vivadagrast he

 اسوقت یہ کمزور ریاست تھی Hindi grammar is the scripture to understand the rules of writing and speaking the Hindi language in pure form
 yah hindi bhashaa ke adhyayan kaa mahatvapurn hissaa he
 In it all forms of Hindi are studied under four sections; For example, under the Varna idea, the rules regarding the different aspects of the word under the sound and the letter and the word idea, and the different situations related to the sentence under the sentence idea and the artistic aspects of literary works have been considered in the verse idea
 varna vichaar hindi vyakaran kaa pehla khand he, jisamen bhashaa kii mul ikai dhwani tathaa varna par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 Under this, the rules related to the definition of basic letters of Hindi, the distinction, pronunciation, combination, alphabet etc
 are described
 hindi bhashaa kii lipi devanagari he
 The Devanagari alphabet has a total of 52 letters, including 11 vowels, 33 consonants, an anusvara and a visarga
 iske atirikt hindi varnmaala main do dvigun vyanjan tathaa chaar sanyukt vyanjan hote hai
 There are a total of eleven vowels in Hindi language
 ye gyaarah swar hai- a, aa, i, i, u, uu, ri, e, i, o, ou
 'an' and 'aah' are not counted in the vowel
 inhen ayogavah dhvaniyaan kehete hai
 The word idea is the second section of Hindi grammar under which rules related to the definition of the word, differences, terms, disjunctions, conversions, constructions, etc
 are considered
 shabd varnon yaa aksharon ke sarthak samooh ko kehete hai
 According to grammar, there are two types of words - vikari and avakari or avayya
 vikari shabdon ko chaar bhaagon main baanta gaya he- sangya, sarvnaam, visheshan or kriya
 There are also four types of non-invariant words or avayya - adverbs, afferents, conjunctions, and exclamations, thus making the following 8 types of distinctions: kisi bhi sthaan, vyakti, vastu aadi kaa naam bataane vaale shabd ko sangya kehete hai
 Examples - sangya ke bhed- a total of 5 distinctions of the noun are explained
 sangya ke badale main aane vaale shabd ko sarvnaam kehete hai
 Examples - sangya ke sthaan par prayukt hone vaale shabd ko sarvnaam kehete he
 The pronoun is used not to repeat the noun
 jaise - main, tu, tum, aap, vah, ve aadi
 personal pronoun
 sarvnaam ke bhed There are six types of pronouns
 purushavachak sarvnaam The pronoun which is used by the speaker or writer for himself or herself, is called a 'masculine pronoun'
 purushavachak sarvnaam teen prakaar ke hote hai- Definitive pronoun jo sarvnaam kisi vyakti, vastu aadi kii ore nishchaypurvak sanket karen ve nishchayvachak sarvnaam kehalaate hai
 For example, the words 'this', 'that', 'those' are pronouncing definitively to a particular person, so they are definitive pronouns
 udhaaharan- Indefinite pronoun jin sarvnaam shabdon ke dwaara kisi nishchit vyakti athwa vastu kaa bodh na ho ve anishchayvachak sarvnaam kehalaate hai
 Such as 'someone' and 'some' etc
 pronoun words
 inase kisi vishesh vyakti athwa vastu kaa nishchay nahin ho rahaa he
 Therefore, such words are called indefinite pronouns
 udhaaharan- Relative pronouns paraspar sabandh batalaane ke liye jin sarvanaamon kaa prayog hota he unhen sambandhvaachak sarvnaam kehete hai
 Like- 'joe', 'he', 'whose', 'his', 'like', 'such' etc
 udhaaharan- Interrogative pronoun jo sarvnaam sangya shabdon ke sthaan par bhi aate he or vaakya ko prashnvachak bhi banaate hai, ve prashnvachak sarvnaam kehalaate hai
 Like what, who etc
 udhaaharan- reflexive pronouns jahaan swayan ke liye ‘aap’, ‘apana’ athwa ‘apane’, ‘aap’ shabd kaa prayog ho vahaan nijvachak sarvnaam hota he
 Among these, the words 'apna' and 'aap' are the best, male middle men and other men who are making knowledge of themselves, which are called personal pronouns
 vishesh- Where the word 'you' is used for the listener, it is a respectable middle man and where the word 'you' is used for himself, it is private
 udhaaharan- Special use of pronoun words sangya yaa sarvnaam kii visheshta bataane vaale shabd ko visheshan kehete hai
 Examples - visheshan ke bhed1,sankhyavachak visheshan 2, quantitative adjectives 3,gunavachak visheshan 4, pronouns kaary kaa bodh karaane vaale shabd ko kriya kehete hai
 Examples - kriyaayein do prakaar kii hotin hai- Transitive verb: The verb which has a karma is called transitive verb
 udhaaharan - khaanaa, pinaa, likhnaa aadi
 The monkey eats banana
 is vaakya main 'kya' kaa uttar 'kelaa' he
 Intransitive verb: There is no action
 udhaaharan - hansanaa, ronaa aadi
 The child cries
 is vaakya main 'kya' kaa uttar uplabdh nahin he
 Gender and duration of the verb: kriya kaa ling karta ke ling ke anusaar hota he
 Example - crying: the boy cries
 ladki roti he
 The boy used to cry
 ladki roti thi
 The boy will cry
 ladkee roegi
 The meaning of the sentence becomes more clear with the use of auxiliary verbs
 isse vaakya ke kaal kaa tathaa kaary ke jari hone, purna ho chukne athwa aarambh na hone ki sthiti kaa bhi pataa chalata he
 Example - The dog is barking
 
 The dog must have barked
 
 The word that describes the characteristic of any verb is called an adjective
 udhaaharan - Distinction of adjective: do shabdon yaa vaakyon ko jodne vaale sanyojak shabd ko samucchy bodhak kehete hai
 Examples - vismay prakat karne vaale shabd ko vismayadibodak kehete hai
 Examples - hindi main teen purush hote hai- The word man and us are used in Uttam Purush, in which we are used both singular and plural
 is prakaar ham uttam purush ekvachan bhi he or bahuvachan bhi he
 For example, if we say "we are all Indians", then here we are plural and if it is written that "we are skilled in the work of electricity", then here we are also in singular form and plural form Is also in hamako sirf tumse pyaar he - is vaakya main dekhen to, "ham" ekvachan ke rup main prayukt hua he
 The speaker also uses us as a singular to give value to himself
 lekhak bhi kai baar apane bare main kehane ke liye ham shabd kaa prayog ekvachan ke rup main apane lekh main karte hai
 Thus we also have a singular pronoun as a singular
 hindi main do vachan hote hai: There are only two genders in Hindi: female and male
 koi vastu yaa jaanavar yaa vanaspati yaa bhavvaachak sangya streeling he yaa pulling, iskaa gyaan abhyaas se hota he
 Sometimes it is also known by the endings of the noun
 8 kaarak hote hai
 All the words of any sentence can be classified into these 8 factors
 udhaaharan- ram ne amaruud khaaya
 Here ‘rama’ is the doer, ‘khana’ is karma
 do vastuon ke madhya sambandh bataane vaale shabd ko sambandhkaarak kehete hai
 Examples - ve shabd jo kisi duusare shabd ke armbh main lagaaye jate hai
 Applying these can change the meaning or specificity of the words
 pra+ mod = pramod, su + sheel = susheel Prefixes are paratantras by nature
 upsarg chaar prakaar ke hote hai - Words that are added to the end of a word are called suffixes
 jaise- gaadi + vaan = gaadiwan, apana + pen = apnaapan When two words are close together, to combine them is called a treaty
 jaise- surya + udai = suryoday, ati + aavashyak = atyaavashyak, sanyasi = sam + nyaasi, ravi + indra = rabindra The two words together form an entire term
 jaise-raaj+putr = raajputr, chote+bade = chote-bade aadi samaas chha: hote hai: Duality, Dwigu, Tatpurush, Karmadhyara, Avayabhav and Bahubrihi vaakya vichaar hindi vyakaran kaa teesraa khand he jisamen vaakya kii paribhaasha, bhed-upbhed, sanrachana aadi se sambandhit niyamon par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 a group of words that makes full sense, is called a sentence
 vaakya ke do anivaary tatva hote hai- What is talked about is called objective and what is talked about is called predicate

 It has an objective - Mohan and Vyayat - lives in Prayag
 vaakya bhed do prakaar se kiye ja sakate han- There are eight types of sentences based on the meaning - 1-vidhaan vaachak vaakya, 2- nishedhvachak vaakya, 3- prashnvachak vaakya, 4- vismyadivachak vaakya, 5- ajnavachak vaakya, 6- ichhavachak vaakya, 7- ndehvachak vaakya
 Sentences can be in any of three tenses: padbandh do shabdo kaa sangyojan hai "pad + bandha
 Before knowing the phrase, it is important to know what is the verse or verse introduction
 (pad: jis shabd kaa pura vyakaran kii parichay dena hota he jaise shabd kaa vachan kya he, ling kya he, kriya he yaa phir kriya visheshan, sangya shabd hai yaa phir sarvnaam shabd he aadi kii puri jaankaree de use pad kehete he

 Panini first wrote Sanskrit grammar in the fourth century BCE
 sansar ke praayah sabhi deshon main bhashaa-chintan hota rahaa he
 Apart from India, there has been a lot of awareness about linguistic studies in countries like China, Greece, Rome, France, England, USA, Russia, Czechoslavia, Denmark etc

 The importance of 'speech' has been highlighted many times in the oldest book Rigveda
 bhashashastra main vaak -vivechan ek atyant jatil vishay he
 'speech' is the fundamental power, which we accept as language through social contexts
 veda main isi vaak-shakti kii adhishthatri devi ke rup main saraswati kaa aahvaan kiya gaya he, jisamen is baat kii kaamana kii gai he ki ve vaak-shakti kaa paan karakar vishwa ko pusht karen
 That means make humans worthy of equitable speech
 'uccharan bhashaa kaa prantatva hota he', ise sabhi bhashavigyaani sweekaar karte hai
 Pure pronunciation is considered very important in the Veda
 chunki veda 'apaurushey' he, isliye uskaa samay nishchit nahin he
 After Vedo comes the time of Brahmanas
 aitarey brahman main bhashavigyaan ke do mukhya vishyon - bhashaa-vargeekaran evam shabd-arth kaa vivechan kiya gaya he
 Veda-recitation is a bit difficult
 uske adhyayan ko saral banane ke liye padpath kii rachnaakar 'veda-vaakya' ko padon main vibhakt kiya gaya or is kram main sandhi, samaas, swaraghaat jaise vishyon kaa vishleshan bhi hua
 This was definitely a scientific study of the language

 In order to preserve the pronunciation of different codes and to discuss the nuances of sound, respectively, the precepts and teachings have their own special place
 praatishakhyon main ripraatishakhya, shuklayajuh praatishakhya, maitrayani praatishakhya aadi pramukh hai or shikshagranthon ke nirmaataaon me yajyavlky, vyas, vasishtha aadi vikhyath hai

 Panini's position is paramount among the world's linguists
 na keval paurasty vidwaanon ne, apitu paashchaatya vidwaanon ne bhi panini kii shreshtataa muktakant se sweekaar kar lee he
 About five hundred years before Christ, such an illiterate scientist was born, this episode has inspired the world as well as amazed
 panini kaa apratim bhashavaigyanik granth, aath adhyyon main vibhakt rahane ke kaaran, ashtaadhi kehalaata he
 There are four legs in the eight chapters
 sampoorn granth sutara rup main rachit he or kul sutron kii sankhya lagbhag chaar sahasr he
 Only the famous fourteen Maheshwar Sutras are considered as the base of Ashtadhyayi
 ashtaadhi ke aath adhyyon main sangya, kriya, samaas, kaarak, sandhi, krit or taddhit pratyay, swar-dhwani-vikaar or pad kaa vivechan kiya gaya he
 The availability of the text has been further increased by giving the text and metal text in the appendix
 'ashtaadhi'kii pramukh visheshtaayen hai : Other texts of Panini are Unadasutra, Linganushasan and Panniyya Shiksha
 paninikalin main katyayan evam patanjali vishesh ullekhneey hai

 But it is so certain that at the core of writing Mahabhashya, inspiration of funny talks has been working
 kaaran yah ki mahabhashya kaa adhikansh bhaag katyayan dwaara uthaayi gai shankaaon ke samaadhaan se sambaddh hai
 The main objective of Patanjali has been to prove defective the Panini Sutras, who were either defective or not very useful in the view of Katyayana
 iske atirikt, unhone ashtaadhi ke kathin sutron kaa bhashya bhi prastut kiya he, jo atyant spasht or vistrut he
 a total of 1689 sutras have been explained in the Mahabhashya
 yadhyapi mahabhashya kaa aadhaar ashtaadhi hi rahi he, tathaapi isamen patanjali ne janabhasha kaa jaisaa vistrut vivechan kiya he, vaisaa anyatra durlabh he
 His linguistic study was not only deep and comprehensive but his ability for language analysis was also unique

 The giving of bhritahari to linguistics: The importance of syntactic In the linguists of post-patanjali-post, the position of syntactic bhritahari is very high
 na keval pracheen bhashashastra kii drushti se bhrirtahari mahaan he, apitu aadhunik bhashavigyaani bhi unke chintan se atyadhik prabhavit hai
 There is an excellent book of syntactic linguistics divided into three condoms - Brahmacand, Sentence and Padakanda

 Aristotle is called the father of Western linguistics
 unhone bhashaa kii utapatti or prakruti ke sambandh main apane guru plato se bhinn vichaar vyakt kiye
 According to him language is the result of agreement and tradition
 unhone bhashaa ko yadrichhik kaha he
 This opinion of Aristotle is still accepted today
 gaay ko "gaay" isaliye nahin kaha jaataa he ki is shabd se is vishesh choupaae jaanavar kaa bodh hona anivaary he, balki isaliye kaha jaataa he ki kabhi ukt pashu kaa bodh karaane ke liye is shabd kaa yadrichhik prayog kar liya gaya tha, jise manyata mil gai or jo parampara se chalaa aa rahaa he unhone shabdon ke teen bhed "sangya", "kriya", "nipaat" kiya
 The study of language in Greece was limited to philosophers only
 unhone apni bhashaa ke atirikt duusari bhashaaon main koi ruchi nahin dikhaai
 Alexander's armies occupied a wide area from Greece to the northern border of India, but his descriptions do not mention the dialects of those regions

 Along with this, some dictionaries are also found in which many words of languages spoken in Asia Minor have been included in addition to Greek and Latin
 unaniyon ne bhashaa ko tatvamimasaa kii drushti se parkhaa he
 The linguistics presented by him has been termed philosophical grammar
 unaniyon kii tarah romanon ne bhi vyakaran or kosh banaae
 In the Middle Ages Christian missionaries had to learn other languages
 janata ko janata kii bhashaa main upadesh dena prachaar ke liye anivaary tha
 As a result, practical methods of learning the language came out
 mishnariyon ne anek bhashaaon ke vyakaran tathaa kosh banaae
 But they were incomplete and inappropriate because they were composed in Greek Latin grammar structures

 In short, the study of European languages before the 19th century was more logical than logical, more conceptual than metaphorical, and more subjective than descriptive
 unnisvin shatee aitihaasik tulanaatmak bhashavigyaan kaa yug tha| iske prarambh kaa shrey sanskrit bhashaa se paashchaatyon ke parichay ko he
 Comparative linguistics began in a way when Sir William Jones declared in Calcutta on 2 February 1786 that the structure of Sanskrit language is amazing, it is more complete than Greek, richer than Latin, and more sophisticated than both
 
 phir bhi iskaa donon se ghanishtha sambandh he
 He saw that Sanskrit has so much similarity with Greek and Latin on one side and Gothic, Kelty on the other, that there must have been only one source of all these
 yah paariwarik dharna is nae vigyaan ke mul main he
 The first systematic work in this direction is that of the Danish resident Rask
 rask ne bhashaaon kii samgr sanrachana kii tulana par adhik bal diya or kaha ki keval shabdaawalee kaa samya aagat shabdon ke kaaran bhi ho saktaa he
 He also considered the equanimity of the swans as an important part of determining family relationships
 is dharna ko suvyavasthit pushti di yakove greem ne, jinke swan niyam bhashaa vigyaan main prasiddh hai
 These Swan rules explain the systematic consonant swan changes occurring from indo-european language to prepositional, subsequently to High German
 isi bich sanskrit ke adhikadhik parichay se paariwarik tulana kaa kram adhikadhik gaharaa hota gaya
 Bopp published comparative grammar of Sanskrit, Avesta Greek, Latin, Lithuanian, Gothic, German, ancient Slavic Kelty and Albany languages
 rask or grim ne swan parivartanon par prakaash daalaa, bop ne mukhyat: rupaprakriya kaa aadhaar grahan kiya
 The names of Maxmüller and Schlaikhar are particularly notable after Rask, Grimm and Bop
 mexumular kii mahatvapurn kriti "lesans in di siance ov language" he
 Schlaikhar presented a well organized comparative grammar of the languages of the indo-european family
 Schlaikhar also did special work on the theoretical side of comparative linguistics
 inke anusaar yadi do bhashaaon main samaan parivartan paae jate hai, to ye donon bhashaayen kisi kaal main ek saath rahi hongi
 In this way, they paved the way for the reconstruction of Adibhasha on comparative basis
 punarrachana ke atirikt bhashavigyaan ko inaki ek or mukhya dein bhashaaon kaa prarupasuchak vargeekaran he
 These days Hivtani is a pioneer among the American scholars coming in the field of linguistics
 inhone bhashaa ke vikaas or bhashaa ke adhyayan par pustaken likhin
 His Sanskrit grammar, published in 1876, is a unique book in his field
 shlikhar ke turant baad fik ne 1868 main sarvapratham bharat-europea bhashaaon kaa tulanaatmak shabdkosh prakashit kiya, jisamen aadi bhashaa ke punarrachit rup bhi die gaye the
 After some time the attention of scholars went to some of the grotesquerie of the Grimm Rule
 denmark vaasi warner ne 1875 main ek aisi asangati ko niyambaddh apwaad ke rup main sthapit kiya
 This inconsistency was the indo-european P, K, k becoming dissatisfied in German
 warner ne greek or sanskrit kii tulana se iskaa apwaad found nikaala jo warner niyam ke naam se prachlit he
 The establishment of such exceptions confirmed a sect of scholars in their own beliefs
 ye navy vaiyaakaran kehalaate hai
 Their opinion is no exception to Swan rules
 swan parivartan aakasmik or avyavasthit nahin he, pratyut niyat or suvyavasthit hai
 The inconsistency is due to the fact that we have not fully understood their process, because there is a lack of language samples
 kuch asangatiyon ke mul main saadrishy he, jisaki purvaacharyo ne upeksha kii thi
 Thus these new grammars were very systemic
 aitihaasik tulanaatmak bhashavigyaan par 20veen sadi main bhi kaary hua he
 The comparative grammar of Brugmann and Delbrück and Hermann Hurt are important texts on the indo-european family
 meie kaa bharat-europea bhashaaon ke tulanaatmak adhyayan kii bhoomika naamak granth sanathan mahatv kaa kaha ja saktaa he
 After the discovery of the ancient language called Hittite, a new work on indo-european linguistics started
 bharat europietar pariwaron par aitihaasik tulanaatmak kaary ho rahaa he
 Greenberg's classification of African languages is exemplary
 isaki adhunathan shakha bhashaa kalkram vigyaan he, jiske antargat tulanaatmak paddati se us samay ke nirupan kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he jab kisi bhashapariwaar ke do sadsy pruthak pruthak hue the
 American anthropologist Morris Swedish is the originator of this process
 yah paddati radio rasayan dwaara lee gai he
 The linguistics of the twentieth century can be called primarily descriptive or structural linguistics
 ise aadhunik rup denevaalon main pramukh baadein, henry sweet or sosur hai
 Even before the theories propounded by the Swiss linguistic Sosur, Humboldt proposed that linguistics should be studied on the basis of the internal components of the same language without being compared to any other language
 sosur ne sarvapratham bhashaa kii pravriti par prakaash daalate hue sanketit or sanketan ke sambandh ko vastu na maanakar prakaarya mana or use bhashaai chihn se abhihit kiya
 The sign is random i
e
 'indicated' has no rational relation to 'indicator'
 vriksh ke liye ‘ped’ kehane main koi tark nahin he; ‘pa’, ‘e’, ‘da’, swanon main kuch aisa nahi he ki vah vriksh kaa hi sanketak ho, yah keval parampara ke kaaran he
 In addition, the mark is valued in the context of the entire terminology used in the language, meaning their opposition
 bhashaa kaa inhen virodhon kii prakaaryata par nirbhar rahanaa varnanaatmak bhashaa vigyaan kaa aadharastambh he
 Their power is dependent on the principle of opposition
 sosur ne bhashaa ke do prayogon parole or long main bhi bhed kiya
 The first is the living form of language, our speech is high parole
 kintu dwitiya bhavanayan kii prakriya se udbhoot ek amoort bhaavana he
 Your Hindi, our Hindi, everyone's Hindi is different from the pronunciation of utterance, on a personal level: yet the abstract concept of Hindi language is long, which is the result of the process of Bhavāyanayana and which is beyond and generalized by many of these individual distinctions
 yah sakalik he he
 The importance of Sosur can be considered revolutionary in structural linguistics
 baad main europe ke anek skool copenhagen, praha, landan tathaa america ke bhashavaigyanik sampradaay inke kuch mul siddhanto ko lekar viksit hue hai
 a sect developed under the inspiration of Sosur in Europe is famous as Prah School
 iske pravartak roosi vidwaan trubejakoy the
 Its chief preacher in Bad became Roman Yokobson
 is skool kii siddhant pradarshika pustak trabejakoa likhit, svanaprakriya ke siddhant he| is skool main svanaprakriya par vishesh bal diya jaataa he
 This word is used in a special wide sense in them
 iske antargat bhaashan swanon ke prakaarya kaa sarvangin adhyayan aa jaataa he or isi kaaran ye log prakaarywaadee kehalaate hai
 The importance of this denomination lies in the deterministic method of linguistic structure that considers how the swan units integrate into specific linguistic systems
 yah paddati virodh par ashrith he
 Positive differences when expressive also mean differences, are considered oppositional
 udhaaharan ke liye hindi 'kaal' or 'gaal' shabdon ko len
 The positive difference between them is self-evident
 parinamswaroop ‘k’ or ‘ga’ do pruthak pruthak swanim hai
 It should be noted here that a and c are not automatically phonemes, these phonemes are the only reason that they are antagonistic in meaning
 swan swat: swanim ko nirdhaarit nahin karte| swanimatv kii nirdharak he in swanon kii virodhatmak prakaaryata
 Thus, the phoneme 'a, c' is not as real as the swans
 ye keval amoort bhav yaa virodhatmak prakaaryon ke yoga hai
 This protest has been described in great detail in this sect
 iske anek praturup yugma, jaise dwipashrvik, bahuparshvik anupatik, vilgati aadi paribhaashit kiye gaye hai
 Technological words such as disbarment, archiswoman, millennium, etc
 belong to this school
 france ke andre martine ne is virodh kii mahatta kaa aitihaasik svanvikas main bhi prayog kiya or kalkramik svanaprakriya kii neenv daali
 Many self-mutations arising from chronology also present differences in the language's self-occurrence
 ye prakaaryaatmak parivartan kehalaate hai
 These functional changes also come from the system and are in the direction of harmony or laghav
 is prakaar praha skool aitihaasik vikaason kii bhi tarksangat vyakhya main safal hua he
 At the same time another sect came into existence in Europe
 yah ‘copenhagen skool’, ‘danish skool’, athwa ‘glacematics’ kai naam se prasiddh he
 Its innovator is Helmslev and has a theory book Omkring Sprogteorienx Grundloeggelse, 1943 English translation by Whitefield Prolegomena to a Theory of Language, 1953
 yah sampradaay adhiktar siddhanton ke vivechan main simit rahaa
 But right now these principles have been used on linguistic quantity in very small quantity
 The importance of this sect is that it is pure formist
 bhashaa ko yah bhi sosur kii bhanti mulyon kii vyavastha maanata he, kintu bhashavishleshan main bhavetar tatwon kaa tathaa bhashavigyanetar vigyaanon kaa, jaise bhautikee, sharirprakriyavigyaan, samajashaastra aadi kaa aashray nahi lenaa chahta
 The analysis method should be pure language and competent in itself and complete in itself
 is sampradaay main abhivyakti or aashay prayek ke do do bhed kiye gaye rup or saar bhashetar tatv he
 The form is a pure linguistic element as a composition system of abstracts
 is prakaar abhivyakti banati he or abhivyakti ke rup main sanrachana vyavastha, jaise, swanim, roopim aadi he
 Similarly, within the essence of intention, there are semantics and in the form of meaning is phenomenology
 henry sweet iske aadharastambh kahe ja sakate he
 This special addition has been made by Professor Firth, a scholar of linguistics and phonology at the University of London
 yah skool arth ko bhi manyata detaa he
 According to this, language is a meaningful verb and the importance of the meaning process has also been accepted
 is skool main dhvanyatmak vivechan ke saath hi saath ragaatmak tatwon kii charchaa hoti he
 Positive analysis is different from American phonological scientific analysis, and its scope is much broader
 ragaatmak vishleshan bahuvyavasthajanit he, jab ki swanim vigyaan ekavyavasthajanit he
 Robbins, Lions, Holiday and Diction are among the pioneers of the positive phonology that Firth enforced
 jahaan tak swanvigyaan kaa sambandh he, landan skool ke antargat sweet ke baad danniel jones kaa kaary vishesh rup se ullekhneey he
 Although naming the American school on the weight of words like 'prahaschool' and 'copenhagen School' would not be appropriate, as only one method did not work here; Nevertheless, the American school has been called for convenience
 america main sanrachanaatmak bhashavigyaan ke pravartakon main boaaj, sapir tathaa bluemfield ke naam aate hai
 The first two of them were originally anthropologists and linguistic analysis was a practical necessity for them
 unhone amareeki junglee jatiyon kii bhashaaon ke varnan kaa prayaas kiya he
 Bloomfield was undoubtedly well-versed in historical comparative linguistics and had full authority over Germanic languages
 bluemfield amareeki bhashavigyaan ke preranastrot rahe hai or aap kii pustak bhashaa bade aadar ke saath padhi-padhai jaati he
 Bloomfield's importance is that he established linguistics in the category of science and gave grammar and linguistic thinking the form of science in the true sense
 inkaa aagrah rahaa he ki bhashaa kaa vishleshan vargeekaran tathaa prastutikaran vaigyanik reeti se hona chahie
 Meaning has no direct relation to linguistic analysis
 manovigyaan darshan aadi kaa aashray nahin lenaa chahie, na atakalein lagaani chahie or na shithil, aspasht shabdaawalee main tathyon ko prakat karnaa chahie
 He believed in the inexhaustibility of Swan rules
 kintu bluemfield ne vishleshan paddati par koi vishesh prakaash nahin daalaa
 This gap was fulfilled by his next generation of scholars
 pike ne "swanivigyaan" main or naida ne rupaprakriya main vishleshan paddati kaa vistaar se vivechan kiya he
 Pike devised the tagmatic method which became palpable due to the uniform use of both morphology and syntax
 is paddati par anekanek bhashaaon ke vishleshan or vivaran prastut kiye gaye hai or sarvatra yah safal rahi he
 His contemporary Jallig Harris also wrote his book on structuralism
 isi samay wales ne avyavhit avyav kii paddati se vaakyon kaa vishleshan karnaa shuru kiya, jise anek bhashavidon ne apanaaya
 Then Chaumsky, a disciple of Harris, came out with a very mathematical and rational method
 yah he roopantaran-janan paddati| yah adhunathan paddati he or bhashavaigyanikon ko sarvaadhik priy ho chali he

 Social cognition is encoding, storage, retrieval, and processing
 In the field of social psychology, social cognition refers to a specific approach in which these processes are studied according to the methods of cognitive psychology and information processing theory
 is vichaar ke anusaar, saamaajik anubhuti unhen aabaad he ki sangyanatmak prakriyaaon kii jaanch se saamaajik, manovaigyanik ghatana ko samajhane ke liye karnaa he ki vishleshan kaa ek str he
 The major concerns of the approach are perception, memory of the processes involved in judgment, and social stimuli; Effects of social and affective factors on information processing; There are behavioral and interpersonal consequences of cognitive processes
 vishleshan ke is str interpersonal, parsparik, interagarop, or intergrup prakriyaaon par anusandhan sahit, saamaajik manovigyaan ke bheetar kisi bhi saamagree ke kshetra ke liye lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 Social cognition came to prominence with the rise of cognitive psychology in the late 1960s and 1970s and is now an effective model and approach in mainstream social psychology
 saamaajik anubhuti siddhanton ko aam jaankaree jaise skima, adhikaar, yaa lakeer ke fakir ke rup main " sangyanatmak tatwon " ke rup main mastishk main pratinidhitiv kiya he ki vichaar he
 The focus is often employed on how these cognitive elements are processed
 saamaajik anubhuti isliye lagu hota he or sangyanatmak tark main pahachaanaa ja saktaa he ki manovigyaan, dhyaan or smriti se kai vishyon, siddhanton, or maandand faili hui he
 It is likely that social psychology was always a more cognitive than general psychology approach, as it traditionally discusses internal mental states such as beliefs and desires when mainstream psychology was dominated by pragmatism
 saamaajik skima siddhant par banaata he or vichaaron yaa "avadharanaon " mastishk main pratinidhitiv kar rahe hai or ve kaise vargeekrut kar rahe hai jo varnan kaise sangyanatmak manovigyaan main skima siddhant se shabdaawalee kaa upyog karata he
 According to this view, we are thinking or thinking about a concept that is connected to the original concept by a mental representation or schema association that is "active" the mind la other information
 is sakriyan aksar anjaane main hi hota he
 As a result of activating such schemas, decision schemas exemplify the extension of the information given since many of the associations, which actually go beyond the available information, are formed
 in nirnyon sahi he yaa nahin kar rahe hai ki kya yah parvaah kiye bina saamaajik anubhuti or vyavhaar ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 For example, if a person is introduced as a teacher, then a "teacher schema" may be activated
 baad main, ham gyaan yaa praadhikari, yaa ham yaad he or mahatvapurn maanate hai ki shikshakon ke ateet ke anubhavon ke saath is vyakti ke sahyogi ho saktaa he
 a schema means that it is more rapidly activated and can be used in a particular situation and has become more accessible
 skima kii pahunch badhaane ki do sangyanatmak prakriyaaon pramukhataa or bhadakaana hai
 Prominence is the degree to which a particular social object stands out relative to other social objects in such a situation
 bhadakaana ek skima or adhik sulabh hone kaa kaaran banataa he ki ek sthiti ke liye turant pehle kisi bhi anubhav ko darshata he
 en: Social_cognition ghevda ko 'nenua' or 'gilki' aadi naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he
