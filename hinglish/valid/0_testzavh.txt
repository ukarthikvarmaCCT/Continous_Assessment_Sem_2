 yashadikaran yaa galvanikaran yaa yashadalepan ek dhaatukarmik prakram he jisamen ispaat yaa lohe ke upar jaste kii parat chadha di jaati he
 This prevents corrosion of these metals
 yadhyapi yashadikaran kii prakriya swayan ek gaiyr-vidyutrasinic prakriya he kintu phir bhi yah prakriya ek vidyutrasinic uddeshy kii purti karti he
 This process is called galvanization in most European languages and is named after the Italian scientist Luigi Galvani
 ispaat ko pighale hue jaste main dubaakar sangrakshit karne kii prakriya 150 varsh se bhi adhik puraani he
 This process was invented in 1837 by Mosier Stanislas Sorrell of Paris
 sade ispaat ke bane hue patale taron or chaadaron ko sanksharan se bachaane ke liye ise kisi sankshararodhi dhaatu kii patali parat se dhakaa jaataa he
 Among the metals used for this work, zinc and vang are the main ones
 jasta sabase sasti dhaatu padati he
 There are four methods of zinc plating on steel: 1-ushn nimajjan prakriya ; 2-electrolytic turbidity; 3-sherardikaran 4- Hot metal spray
 ushn nimajjan gailavanikaran dekhen
 The process of cooling or electrolytic for the application of zinc on certain types of materials is nowadays useful
 is vidhi ke laabh ye hai : 1
 Austerity in the use of zinc; 2
 lep kii vaanchit motaai par ek seemaa tak niyantran; 3
 climbing of pure zinc coating; 4
 ispaat kii kamaani jaisi vastuon ke liye, jo ushn vidhi main pichley jaste ke taap se prabhavit ho sakati he, isaki upyuktata tathaa 5
 Lack of deformed and zigzag ramps in coating of flat surface, as seen in hot method
 is vidhi ke dosha ye hai: 1
 Taking longer than the hot method, 2
 mote aspanjeey lep praapt karne main kathinata, 3
 Luster not as lustrous as lather, 4
 thik thik lep praapt karne main ushn vidhi kii apeksha adhik saavdhaanee baratane kii aavashyaktaa or adhik kathinaaiyon kaa saamana padana tathaa 5
 jalaabhedya bartanon ke nirmaan main vidyudvishleshya vidhi kaa jhalaai main utana prabhaavshaalee na hona jitna ushn vidhi kaa
 The basis of all electrodynamic solutions is zincsulfate
 is vidhi main lep kii janevaali vastu ko dhaatu ke drum yaa baks main jastachurna se gher kar, jisamen dhatvik jasta rahata he, garam karte hai
 This method is especially suitable for items on which very thin coating is required for preservation and where the carving, pattern and design of the characters are to be kept as they are
 isamen yahi dosha he ki choti moti vastuon par hi isse jasta chadhaaya ja saktaa he
 In this method, a light spray of melted zinc on a pre-cleaned hot steel is done with a special type of metal atomizer
 bade bade paatro par jasta chadhaane ke liye yah sugam vidhi he
 This coating does not make alloys with steel
 saadhaaran jasti lep vayumandaleey tathaa drav sanksharan ke prati khule rahete hai or mitti ke sanksharan ke prati kam maatra main khule rahete hai
 Their atmospheric corrosion resistance is dependent on contamination against airborne acid substances, such as sulfur dioxide at industrial locations, sodium chloride near saline water lakes or the oceans
 is tarah gramin kshetron main audyogic kshetron kii apeksha jasti lep kii aayu 4 se lekar 10 guna tak adhik hoti he
 The amount of corrosion of the galvanized sheets in the fluid, or by the fluid, depends on the concentration of hydrogen ion of the corrosive medium
 piech 6 or 12 ke bich sangrakshi film sthaayee hota he
 The sheets quickly degrade as the ph increases to 4 and 12
5
 prabal khanij amlon ke kuch lakshanon, visheshat: chloride or nitrate vaale lavenon ke vilyan main jasta shighrata se ghul jaataa he
 Chemical, magnetic, microscopic and physics tests of galvanized sheets are carried out
 apalepan pareekshan rasinic he or yah jasti lep ke jaste ke bhaar ke antar par aadhaarit he, jo pareekshan ke samay villin ho jane se hota he
 The thickness of the coating is determined by magnetic testing without destroying the object
 jaste kaa lep achumbakeey hone ke kaaran chadar ke sanghnitr paripath kii chadar ke lep kii motaai ke anusaar prerana main parivartan ho jaataa he
 This change is measured and the thickness is calculated from it
 thik thik nikshaarit aadi kaat ke sookshmdarshi dwaara adhyayan se lep kii motaai or banaavat prakat hoti he
 Physical methods determine the deformations that normally occur by folding, folding, pressing the edge and pulling the sheet without removing the coating
 baar-baar saamne aanevaale dosha main mukhya dosha fafola padana he
 These blisters can range in size from a very fine size to a very large size, and occupy a large space on the surface of the sheet
 ispaat kii sataha ke asatatya ke kaaran hydrogen ekatra hota he or usase fafole banate hai
 The second drawback is the grayness of the coating
 isamen kshetra dhoosar rag kaa ho jaataa he, jisamen manibh yaa to bilkul hote nahin, athwa saamaanya vistaar se chote hote hai
 The definite reasons for this defect are: lohe main adhatu padaarthon kaa rah janaa or When the zinc comes out of the heat, the sheet is very fast frosting
 jasta chadhaane main vishesh saavdhaanee baratkar in dosha kaa nivaaran kiya ja saktaa he

 portland cement vartmaan samay kii saamaanya upyog main aane vaali puure sansar main sarvaadhik prachlit cement he
 It is the basic ingredient of concrete, slurry, etc
 cement kii vibhinn kismein uplabdh hai
 Portland cement is commonly used in ordinary construction work
 portland cement ke avishkaar se pehle tak jodne ke kaam main laae jane vaale padaarth saadhaaran chuunaa or buja chuunaa the
 Portland cement was invented in 1824 AD by an English Raj Joseph Espadin
 kathor ho jane ke gun tathaa england ke portland sthaan main pai jane vaali ek shila ke naam par iskaa naam 'portland' cement padaa
 Portland cement is manufactured using a mixture of limestone and gypsum in a fixed ratio at 1400 ° C
 The temperature at which the initial melting takes place is by heating
 aise praapt avshisht raakh ko thanda kar, phir piskar maheen churna banaaya jaataa he jiskaa 90% bhaag chalani sankhya 170 se chhan jaataa he
 Different varieties of cement can be obtained by adjusting the ratio of these three raw components and adding small amounts of other chemicals
 portland cement ke bade paimaane par nirmaan main jin khanijon kaa prayog hota he unamem silica, alumina, irun oxide chuunaa, magnisia hai
 On burning them there is a chemical combination between them
 cement ke mukhya ghatak hai, tri calcium silicket, daai calcium silicket tathaa tri calcium aluminete, iske atirikt pisane ke purv isamen lagbhag 3% jipsom milaane se cement kii utkrushtataa bad jaati he
 With this, the time of freezing of cement can be controlled
 cement main pani milaane se cement jamata or kathor hota he
 The reason is hydration and water decomposition of its above mentioned components
 praarambhik jamaav aluminete ke kaaran tathaa iske baad kii praarambhik majbootee pradhanthya tri silicket ke kaaran hoti he
 The action of disilicate is the slowest
 ise majbootee pradaan karne main 14 se 28 din yaa isse adhik lag jate hai
 === Quick Hardening Cement === Fast setting Cement becomes strong very quickly though its initial and final deposition time is slightly longer than normal cement
 isamen tri calcium silicket adhik hota he or yah adhik maheen pisa jaataa he
 Due to high production of heat and high contraction at the time of freezing and hardening, it is not widely used in concrete
 tri calcium aluminete ooshmaa vikaas kaa pramukh kaaran he
 Therefore, its quantity in cement is kept to a minimum, only 5%
 is prakaar kaa cement praarambhik avasthaaon main kam majboot hota he
 But there is no difference in its ultimate strength
 jald majboot hone tathaa rasinic prabhaavon ke viruddh drudh rahane ke liye iskaa prayog hota he, jaise behate hue pani athwa samudri jal main
 It is made on a large scale by smelting the mixture in appropriate proportions of alumina and calcareous substances and subsequently grinding the product fine
 aisa cement jamaav ke samay failata he
 a small amount of this is used in building fluid-bearing structures by mixing in other types of cement to prevent cracks in the concrete due to contraction and heat
 cement kaa dhoosar rang apdravya rup main irun oxide ke kaaran hota he
 If there is iron oxide in Portland cement, the color of the cement will be white
 irun oxide ke nikaalane kii laagat, jo prakritik padaarthon kaa saamanyat: ang hota he, safed cement kii keemat ko badha detii he
 Mixing about ten percent pigment while grinding white cement produces colored cement
 dhoosar cement main puraa tathaa laal rang safalataa se daalaa ja saktaa he
 Other main varieties of cement are air-mixed or air-fired cement, sulfate-resistant cement and water-soluble cement
 cement kaa ghan sampeden main banaaya jaataa he
 The cube is kept in a test machine and pressed or compressed until it breaks
 isse cement kii majbootee kaa pataa chalata he
 Standard bricks, of which at least one square inch, is broken to determine the tensile strength
 portland cement ke tanan tathaa sampeden samarthy nimnlikhit prakaar he
 Day --- Compression Strength --- Tensile Strength 3 dinon ke baad--- 1,600 --- 300 7 days after --- 2,500 --- 375 bharat main chuunaa pathar kii adhikta ke kaaran cement udyog kaa bhavishya bahut ujjwal he

 Similarly, production of commercial crops like jute, sugarcane, potato and groundnut has also increased
 vartmaan samay main desh main baagbani fasalon, falon, subjiyon tathaa phulon kii kheti ko bhi badhaava diya ja rahaa he
 Increase in agricultural savings unnatsheel bijon, rasinic khaadon, uttam sinchai tathaa mashiinon ke prayog se utpaadan badha he
 Due to which farmers have increased significantly in the amount of savings
 jisko desh ke vikaas ke kaam main laayaa ja sakaa he
 Strengthening forward and backward relationships naveen praudyogiki tathaa krishi ke aadhunikaran ne krishi tathaa udyog ke paraspar sambandh ko or bhi majboot bana diya he
 Traditionally, though the forward link between agriculture and industry was already strong, because many inputs are made available to industries by the agricultural sector
 parantu in donon main pratigaami sambandh bahut hi kamazor tha, kyonki udyog nirmit vastuon kaa krishi main bahut hi kam upyog hota tha
 But as a result of modernization of agriculture, there has been a huge increase in the demand for industrial manufactured inputs in agriculture, such as agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers, etc
, due to which the retrograde relationship of agriculture has also been strengthened
 anya shabdon main krishi evam audyogic kshetra ke sambandhon main adhik majbootee ai he
 It is thus clear that there has been a substantial improvement in agricultural inputs and production in the country as a result of the Green Revolution
 iske falswaroop krishak, sarkaar tathaa janata sabhi main yah vishwaas jaagrath ho gaya he ki bharat krishi padaarthon ke utpaadan ke kshetra main aatmanirbhar hi nahin ho saktaa, balki niryaat bhi kar saktaa he
 Analysis desh main yojana kaal main krishi ke kshetra main paryaapt vikaas hua he
 The total agricultural area has increased, the nature of the crop has changed, the irrigated area has increased, the use of chemical fertilizers has increased and modern agricultural machines have started being used
 in sab baton ke hote huye bhi abhi tak desh main krishi kaa vikaas uchit str tak nahin pahunch paaya he, kyonki yahan prati hectares krishi utpaadan anya viksit deshon kii tulana main kam he
 It now studies importing many agricultural products
 kyonki unka utpaadan maang kii tulana main kam he
 a large part of the agricultural sector is still unirrigated
 krishi main yantrikaran kaa str abhi bhi kam he, jisase utpaadan laagat adhik aati he
 Farmers do not get sufficient departmental facilities, which hinders agricultural development
 atah is baat kii aavashyaktaa he ki krishi main takniki evam sansthagat sudhaaron ko adhik kargar dhang se lagu kar krishi kshetra kaa or adhik vikaas kiya jaye
 Expansion of green revolution kendriya bajet 2010-2011 main krishi kshetra ke vikaas ke liye banaai gayi kaary yojana ke pehle ghatak main gram sabhaaon tathaa kisaan pariwaron ke sakriy sahyog se desh ke purvi kshetra bihar, chhattisgarh, purvi uttar pradesh, pashchim bengal tathaa urisa main harith kranti ke vistaar ke liye 400 karod rupee kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 Drawbacks and problems desh main harith kranti ke falswaroop kuch fasalon ke utpaadan main paryaapt vruddhi hui he, khadyanno ke aayaat main kami ai he, krishi ke paramparaagat swaroop main parivartan aayaa he, phir bhi is kaarykram main kuch kamiyaan parilakshith hoti hai
 The major shortcomings and problems of the Green Revolution can be presented as follows: prabhaav - harith kranti kaa prabhaav kuch vishesh fasalon tak hi simit rahaa, jaise- gehun, jowar, bajra
 There has been no impact on other crops
 yahan tak ki chaaval bhi isse bahut hi kam prabhavit hua he
 Business crops are also unaffected by this
 poonjivadi krishi ko badhaava - adhik upjau kism ke beej ek puunji-gahan kaarykram hai, jisamen urvarkon, sinchai, krishi yantron aadi aagton par baari maatra main nivesh karnaa padataa he
 Investing heavily is beyond the capacity of small and medium-sized farmers
 is tarah, harith kranti se laabh unheen kisaanon ko ho rahaa he, jinke paas nijee pumping set, tractor, nalakup tathaa anya krishi yantra hai
 This facility is available only to big farmers of the country
 saamaanya kisaan in suvidhaon se vanchit hai
 The need for institutional reforms is not emphasized - the need for institutional reforms has been completely ignored in the new development method
 sansthagat parivartano ke antargat sabase mahatvapurn ghatak bhu-dhaaran kii vyavastha he
 It is only with this technology that maximum output can be achieved by technological changes
 desh main bhoomi sudhaar kaarykram safal nahin rahe hai tathaa lakhon krishakon ko aaj bhi bhu-dhaaran kii nischitata nahin pradaan kii ja saki he
 The problem of labor displacement - Due to agricultural mechanization used under the Green Revolution, labor displacement has got a boost
 gramin jansankhya kaa rojgaar kii talash main shaharon kii ore palaayan karne kaa yah bhi ek kaaran he
 Increasing income inequality - Technological changes in agriculture have the opposite effect on income distribution in rural areas

 raav ke anusaar, "yah baat ab sarvavidit he ki tathakthith harith kranti, jisane desh me khadyannon kaa utpaadan badhaane me sahaayta di he, ke saath gramin aay me asamanta badi he, bahut se chote kisaanon ko apane kaashtakaari adhikaar chhodane pade hai or gramin kshetron me saamaajik or aarthik tanaav bade hai
 " aavashyak suvidhaon kaa abhaav - harith kranti kii safalataa ke liye aavashyak suvidhaon yatha- sinchai vyavastha, krishi saakh, aarthik jot tathaa saste aagton aadi ke abhaav main krishi-vikaas ke kshetra main vaanchit safalataa nahin praapt ho paa rahi he
 Regional imbalance - The impact of Green Revolution is limited to the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu
 iskaa prabhaav sampoorn desh par naa fail paane ke kaaran desh kaa santulit rup se vikaas nahin ho paaya
 In this way, the Green Revolution has been a limited success
 harith kranti kii safalataa ke liye suzav Promoting Institutional Changes - Land reform programs must be implemented effectively and comprehensively for the success of the Green Revolution
 bataaidaron ko swaamitv kaa adhikaar dilaayaa janaa chahie
 The excess land obtained from the demarcation should be distributed among the landless cultivators
 chakbandi kaa prabhavi banaakar joton ke vibhaajan par prabhavi roak lagaayi jaani chahie
 Facility of agricultural finance - While increasing the facilities of agricultural finance, small farmers should be provided with a credit facility at concessional rate so that they can purchase necessary advanced seeds, chemical fertilizers and agricultural implements
 rojgaar ke avasaron main vruddhi - shram pradhan takneekon ko apanaaya janaa chahie tathaa gramin kshetron main bekaari kii samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye kutir evam gram udyogon kaa teji se vistaar kiya janaa chahie
 Development of means of irrigation - Adequate development of irrigation facilities should be done in the country, so that farmers can take full advantage of high yielding varieties
 is sandarbh main laghu sinchai pariyojnaon ke vistaar par dhyaan diya janaa chahie
 Expansion of other structural reforms - Other structural facilities, including electricity, transport, necessary for the development of agriculture should be developed
 tabhi harith kranti anya fasalon tathaa kshetron tak fail sakegi
 Spread of Green Revolution to other crops - For the success of Green Revolution, it is necessary that it should be extended to the cultivation of rice and other crops
 chaaval ke saath daalen, kapaas, ganna, tilhan, jute aadi vyapaarik fasalon ke sambandh main bhi utpaadan vruddhi santoshjanak nahin rahi he
 Therefore, these crops should also be included in the area of green revolution
 chote khet or chote kisaanon ko sambaddh karnaa - chote kheton tathaa chote kisaanon ko bhi harith kranti se sambaddh karnaa chahie
 For this, it is necessary that land reform programs should be implemented quickly and effectively, small farmers should be provided credit facilities at moderate terms and rates for purchasing essential seeds, fertilizers etc
, simple agriculture
 In addition to the facilities given for the purchase of equipment, hire large farm machinery such as tractors, harvesters etc
 on behalf of the government
 Should be taken, farmers with very small holdings should be motivated to adopt cooperative farming
 samanvit farm niti - harith kranti kii safalataa ke liye samanvit farm niti apanaayi jaani chahie, taaki farm takniki va aagton ke mulyon ke sambandh main ek uchit niti apanaai ja sake tathaa krishakon ko unntshil beej, khaad, kitnashak tathaa krishi yantra evam upkaran uchit mulya par samay par uplabdh ho saken
 Apart from this, the government should make arrangements for the sale of all agricultural produce and should also guarantee to buy agricultural products at a reasonable price
 nayi rashtriya krishi niti The Central Government announced the 'new National Agricultural Policy' on 28 July 2000
 is niti main sarkaar ne 2020 tak krishi ke kshetra main prativarsh 4 pratishat vruddhi kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 The new agricultural policy has been described as 'indradhanush Revolution', in which all the revolutions are directly or indirectly in the agricultural sector of the country, like 'green Revolution', 'white Revolution', 'yellow Revolution', 'blue Revolution' ',' Red Revolution ',' Golden Revolution ',' Brown Revolution ',' Brown Revolution ',' Silver Revolution 'and' Food Chain Revolution 'will have to be taken together, this is called the' Rainbow Revolution ' Security has

 Its name in Dutch means wild animal or wild cattle because in the Afrikaans language beest means cattle while its scientific name Conocitis is made up of two Greek words - konnos which means beard and khaite which means waving hair
 it happens

 It is a creature of the Bovidi clan, which consists of reindeer, cattle, goat and some other finger-horned hoofed animals
 conocitis prajati main do jatiyaan samavisht hai or yah donon hi africa ke mul nivasee hai: kaala wildbist or nila wildbist yaa saamaanya wildbist 
 Fossil evidence suggests that the above two species split about 10 million years ago, causing the northern and southern castes to separate

 In blue and black waldbeast, the most predominant texture is the variation of their horns and the color of their foreskin

 Blue waldbeast is a dark gray striped but sometimes bright blue color
 kaala wildbist bhure rang ke baalo vaala hota he or uskaa ayaal kriim se lekar kaale rang kaa hote hai or punch kriim ke rang kii hoti he
 The blue waldbeast lives in a wide variety of areas such as plains and open forests while the black waldbeast lives only in open plains
 nila wildbist sardiyon main lambii duuri tak pravaas karte hai jabaki yah baat kaale wildbist par lagu nahin hoti he
 Black waldbeast female milk has more protein, less fat, and less milk milk than blue waldbeast
 kisi ek suchak varsh main wildbist ke jhund ke shaavak ek chote se interval main hi paidaa ho jate hai, jisase bhavi shikariyon, jaise singh, junglee kutton, chiton, tenduon or lakadabagghon ko shikaar kii bahutayat ho jaye or zyaada se zyaada shavakon ke bachane kii sambhaavna bad jaye
 Those cubs born outside this period have little chance of survival at the hands of predators
 paidaa hone ke kuch hi samay pashchaat shaavak apni maan kaa anusaran karne lag jate hai
 But these cubs have very high mortality rates and only those who cross the first few years of their life receive good genetic grants from their parents or whose mothers are experienced
 samay-samay par pravaas karne ke kaaran wildbist na to sthai rishte kaayam karte hai or na hi kisi tay kshetra kii raksha karte hai
 Wildbeast breeding begins when males try to placate females by establishing small temporary areas
 yah chote kshetra kareeb 3000 varg meter ke hote hai or ek varg kilometre main 300 kshetra tak ho sakate hai
 Males try to protect these areas from other males as well as pluck females
 nar maadaaon ko rijhaane ke liye hunkaar bharte hai or vishisht pradarshan bhi karte hai

 It has been speculated for migration that there may be several reasons such as food abundance, surface water availability, non-predator predation and phosphorus in the grass
 phosphoras saare jivan ke liye bahut ahm hoti he, khaas taur par dudharu maadaa dhoron ke liye
 This is the reason why during the rainy season the waldbeasts keep looking for the pastures where the phosphorus level is high
 ek adhyayan main yah bhi pataa chalaa ki phosphoras ke saath-saath wildbist unche nitrogen vaale ilaakon kii bhi talash main rahete hai
 Wildbeast was reared in South Africa for its meat

 National Football League kritrim shwasan ek nakal shwasan kii tarah he jo kii sharir main sampoorn vayusanchaar karwaata he
 This means that when a person is not able to breathe on his own or is not trying to breathe by himself, then we do this process
 phuffusiya vayusanchaar koi bhi hastchalit tareeke se kiya ja saktaa he -yaa to biimaar aadmi ke muh se hawa baro uske phepron main yaa phir kisi yantra ke dwaara saans kii vidhi yah prabhavi tareeke se kiya he or sabit kar diya gaya he jo vidhi ke rup main shaamil Silvester yantric gadabadi kii, is tarah ke hathiyaar yaa rogiyon chaati
 ye vidhi zyada laabhakaari he dusre vidhiyon ke tulanaatmak- jaise kii sylvester vidhi
isko munh-se-munh punerjeevan yaa chalati bhashaa main jivan chumban bhi kehete hai
 Artificial respiration is an important method of cardiac pulmonary resuscitation — so it is an essential method of first aid support
 kuch sthitiyon main, kritrim shwasan alag se bhi pradarshan kiya ja saktaa he, jaise kii praayah dub jane jaisi stithi yaa peedaahar dawaaiki atimatra
 kritrim shwasan aaj-kal swasthya peshewaron tak hi simit kar diya gaya he jabaki aam aadmi ko salaah diya jaataa he ki hryday ko dabaa ke punah hosh main laane kaa koshish karnaa chahie
 This should be done on those who are not able to breathe properly or who are having trouble breathing
 In mechanical ventilation, the air is vented into and out of the lungs by the use of mechanical breathing apparatus
 jaise kii jab shalya chikitsak kiya jaataa he saamaanya sangyaaharan ke upyog se yaa jab ek vyakti achetnavastha main rahata he
 This method is also known as 'bachchansa' in which air is sent to the respiratory system of the sick man by mechanical means
 ye vibinn tarkeebon se kiya ja saktaa he jo kii tarah-tarah kii stithiyon par nirbhar hota he
 All methods depend on correct air circulation
 isse pataa chalata he ki koun si vidhi kitni prabhavakaari he
 These methods include: ek lokapriy prakaar he-'jeb mukhauta'

 Most training organizations recommend that a safe mask be used where mouths and patients are involved so that cross-infection is minimized
 bachaav main pochket nakaab or chote chehre nakaab istemaal kiye jate hai
 These obstacles are examples of personal protective equipment which protects the face from blood spots, spray or potential contamination
 ye baadhaen ek tarafa filter valve kii tarah kam karata he jisamen bachaanevaale se hawa rogi tak jaataa he par rogi se kuch bhi bachaanevaale tak nahin jaataa bahut se saadhane ek baar vyavhaar karne ke liye hai
 Those who can behave again and again, they can be washed, autoclaved and used to replace the filter

 In the time of extreme need, a cryptocurotomy can be used by the health officer, where a ventilation site is opened by performing surgery
 It is similar to Trichostomy but is used for uncomplicated cases
 ye tabhi istemaal kiya jaataa he jab faryanks puri tarah se band ho jaataa he yaa toh baari urdhvahanu khyaati hui ho
 Normal atmospheric air contains approximately 21% oxygen, especially carbon, when created inside the lungs after gaseous exchange is taken in place, the air being exhaled by humans normally contains around 17% oxygen in the lungs
 This means that the human body uses oxygen only around 19%, and leaves 80%
 iskaa matlab yah he ki bahut oxygen rogi ke sharir main hota he jo kii oxyemoglobin banataa he
 The ability of artificial respiration can be greatly enhanced by simultaneous use of oxygen therapy
 lagbhag 16% oxigen diya jaataa he rogi ko munh ke dwaara
 yadi usko pochket nakaab ke saath kiya jaataa he toh 40% zyada oxigen rogi ko de sakate hai
 If using a bag valve mask or mechanical respirator, then 99% is only oxygen
 adhik se adhik oxigen ekaagratha or adhik kushal gasiy vinimay fefdon main hoga

 On Borland's re-entry, Durst said, "we are very satisfied with Mike leaving
 We are the kind of people who stay true to their family and their instincts and will act on their predictions at any time
 Mike was not such a person 
 hamen uske saath bajaate huye majaa aayaa lekin apane man main ham hameshaa jaanate the ki vah vahaan nahin tha jahaan ham maansik rup se use chaahate the

 It received average reviews and some critics even thought that Durst was trying hard to imitate the lead singer Jack De La Rocha of Rage Against the Machine

 Another change is that the artificial configuration of the mesh-like and non-classical style has been replaced by the artificial configuration according to the site design, which provides a constantly changing view of the entire environment for continuous inspiration

 But the modern trend is to bring the garden within, which is excellent with all the old attempts to plan the divide between the inside and the outside, because it keeps indoors or outdoors, the presence of nature, the joy, euphoria and serene mood remain uninterrupted

 Ibn Battuta Arab traveler, scholar and author
 uttar africa ke morocco pradesh ke prasiddh nagar tanjier main 14 rajab, 703 hi
 ko inkaa janm hua tha
 His full name was Muhammad bin Abdullah ibn Battuta
 ebn batuta musalmaan yatriyon main sabase mahaan tha
 He estimated to have traveled about 75,000 miles
 itnaa lanbaa bhraman us yug ke shaayad hi kisi anya yatri ne kiya ho
 During his visit India also came
 inke purvajon kaa vyavsaay kaajiyon kaa tha
 Ibn Battuta was very religious from the beginning
 use makke kii yatra tathaa prasiddh musalamaanon kaa darshan karne kii badi abhilaashaa thi
 To fulfill this aspiration, he left to travel at the age of 21 only
 chalate samay usne yah kabhi na sochaa tha ki use itani lambii desh deshaantaron kii yatra karne kaa avasar milegaa
 Traveling to pilgrimage places like maize is an essential duty of every Muslim
 isi se saikadon musalmaan vibhinn deshon se makka aate rahete the
 To facilitate the long journeys of these travelers, many institutions were born at that time in the Muslim world, by which all these facilities were available and their tourism became very interesting and enjoyable
 inhon sansthaaon ke kaaran daridr se daridr "haji" bhi dur-dur deshon se aakar haj karne main samarth hote the
 Ibn Battuta has repeatedly praised these institutions
 vah unke prati atyant kritagya he
 The best among them was the organization by which complete arrangements were made in advance for every kind of convenience of the largest passenger groups and their security was also arranged along the way
 prayek gaanv tathaa nagar main khaankahen tathaa saraayen unke thaharne, khaane pine aadi ke liye hoti thim
 Religious leaders were particularly welcome
 har jagah shaikh, kaaji aadi unka vishesh satkar karte the
 This institution of doctrine was a vivid example of Islam's brotherhood
 isi ke kaaran deshadeshantaron ke musalmaan bekhatke tathaa bade aaraam se lambii lambii yatraayen kar sakate the
 Another feature enjoyed by the medieval Muslims was that the entire trade in Africa and Indian seaports was in the hands of Arab merchants
 ye saudagar bhi musalmaan yatriyon kaa utana hi aadar karte the
 Ibn Battuta arrived in Mecca with a caravan to Damascus and Palestine
 yatra ke dinon main do saadhuon se uski bhent hui thi jinhone usase purvi deshon kii yatra ke sukh saundarya kaa varnan kiya tha
 At the same time, he pledged to visit those countries
 makke se ebn battoota iraq, iran, mosul aadi sthanon main ghumkar 1329 main dubaara makka lautaa or vahaan teen baras thaharkar adhyayan tathaa bhagavandabhakti main laga rahaa
 Later, he resumed the journey and returned to Mecca again for the third time from the ports of South Arabian, East Africa and Persian, Hirmuz
 vahaan se vah kreemia, khiva, bukhaara hota hua afghanistan ke maarg se bharat aayaa
 On reaching India, Ibn Battuta became very rich and prosperous
 bharat pravesh - bharat ke uttar pashchim dwaar se pravesh karke vah sidhaa dilli pahunchaa, jahaan tughlaq sultan mohammad ne uskaa bada aadar satkar kiya or use rajdhani kaa kaaji niyukt kiya
 Staying in this post for seven years, in which he had the opportunity to observe the Sultan very closely, Ibn Battuta listened to every incident with great attention
 1342 main mohammad tughlaq ne use china ke badshaah ke paas apana rajdoot banaakar bheja, parantu dilli se prasthaan karne ke thode din baad hi vah badi vipatti main pad gaya or badi kathinaayee se apni jaan bachaakar anek aapattiyaan sahataa vah kalikat pahunchaa
 In such a situation, thinking that it was futile to go to China on the way to the ocean, he started traveling by landfall and reached China wandering in the regions of Lanka, Bengal etc
 kintu shaayad vah mongol khan ke darbar tak nahin gaya
 He then traveled to Muslim places in West Asia, North Africa, and Spain, and eventually to Timbukt etc
 He returned to Morocco's capital "phase" in early 1354
 iske dwaara arabi bhashaa main likhaa gaya uskaa yatra vrutant jise rihrila kaha jaataa he, 14veen shatabdi main bhartiya upmahadweep ke saamaajik tathaa saanskrithik jivan ke vishay me bahut hi rochak jaankariyaan detaa he
 Back in Morocco - Ibn Battuta was the greatest of Muslim travelers
 anumaanath: usne lagbhag 75,000 mile kii yatra kii thi
 Hardly any other traveler of that era has traveled so long
 "phej" lautakar usne apana bhramanvrittant sultan ko sunaaya
 On the order of the Sultan, his secretary Muhammad ibn Juza'i wrote him
 ebn batuta kaa baaki jivan apane desh main ho beetaa
 He died in 1377
 ebn battoota ke bhramanvrittant ko "tuhfaul nazzaar fi garaayab al amasaar va ajaayab al afasaar" kaa naam diya gaya

 Some critics believe that Sam generally had an addictive personality that overcame his alcohol addiction, but still had a sex addiction, which is demonstrated by his adultery, and for which he eventually gets help
 
 norm kii lat kaarykram kaa kabhi bhi mukhya kendra nahin tha
 Cheers apparently had many owners before Sam, since the tavern was started in 1889

 uske baad ke episod main gus o'malli, jisane sam ko sharabakhaana bechaa tha, vah ek raat ke liye sharabakhaane ko chalaane ke liye arijona se waapas aa jaataa he
 The storyline began with the ownership of Cheers most of the fifth season finale, "I Do, Adieu", when Sam and Dianna split up, Shelley Clove had left her regular role and Sam traveled around the Earth
 Was attempting to do
 jane se pehle sam ne lilian corporation ko chibers bech diya
 In the sixth season premiere "home is the Sailor" Sam returns and his boat sinks to find the bar under Rebecca Howe's new management

 ek or episod main purv vyaavhaarik mazaaq par uske sah-karmiyon se badla lene ke liye gairi ke saath sam sahyogi ban jaataa he

 Sam later becomes compelled to pay the rent for them and often finds himself at the mercy of Hill's tyranny
 rebeka antat hill se peeche vaala anubhag kharid leti he or khud ko or sam ko baar ke prabandhan main saajhedaar banaati he
 Norm Peterson continued to search for gainful employment as an accountant, but remained unemployed for several series, so his continued presence in Cheers has been reconciled in a similar way
 kuch asthir pradarshan or ek choti bhoomika ke liye apni awaz dene ke baavjood bhi uski patni vera ke chehre ko kabhi bhi puure screen main pradarshit nahin kiya gaya
 The "thanksgiving Orphans" episode of the fifth season briefly featured her entire face surrounded by cakes for the first time

 This critical support was joined by early success on Emmy and with the support of nbc's entertainment division president Brandon Tartikoff, and is considered the main reason for the program's survival and eventual success
 pehle sizan ke baad khud abhinayakartaaon ne series ke promoshan kii koshish main duniya bhar ke vibhinn tok kaarykram main shaamil hue

 By the beginning of the 10th season, Cheers put 8 main cast members on its roster
 What was most notable about Cheers was the ability to gradually phase it in, such as Cliff, Frasier, Lilith, Rebecca and Woody
 During season 1 all episodes were made in only one set, the tavern
