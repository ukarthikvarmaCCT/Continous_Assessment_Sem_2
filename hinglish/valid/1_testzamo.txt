 This difference is between the two types of depressed people, the first of which is depressive, secondary to the medicinal or toxic effects of excessive alcohol consumption, and tries to quit with the help of abstinence and the other type
 Depressed people are primed for these effects and do not leave with the help of restraint
 anya dawaaon kaa atirikt upyog sharaabiyon main avsaad ke khatre ko badha saktaa he

 sharabipan ke vikaas ke jokhim ko prabhavit karne vaale anuvaanshik gun sharabipan ke paariwarik itihaas se jude hote hai
 a published article showed that alcohol consumption at an early age may also directly affect the risk of developing alcoholism through affecting the expression of genes themselves, which increases the risk of alcohol dependence
 yah dharna rahi he ki is vaardhik jokhim kaa kaaran atyadhik samvedansheel vikasshil kishor mastishk ho saktaa he jo mastishk kii anuvaanshik avasthaa main parivartan laa saktaa he jo badale main sharaab par nirbharta ke vardhit jokhim ke liye kishor ko taiyaar karata he

 a number of devices can be used to detect loss of control of alcohol consumption
 ye upkaran prashnawali rup main zyaadaatar swa-suchanaaen hai
 Another common theme is a score or tally that summarizes the general severity of alcohol consumption
 Two "yes" responses indicate that the respondent should be investigated further
 The questionnaire asks the following questions: manorog anuvaanshikivid jon ai
 narnaburger junior or laura jin birat kaa suzav he ki sharabipan kaa keval ek hi kaaran nahin hota he—anuvaanshik sahit—balki genes "sharir or mastishk main hone vaali prakriyaaon ko prabhavit karke" ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaate hai "jo sangrakshan yaa samvedansheeltaa utpann karne ke liye ek-duusare ke saath or vyakti ke jivan ke anubhavon ke saath sampark sthapit karte hai
 "they also report that less than a dozen alcoholic jeans have been identified, but there is still a lot to be discovered
 elil ke liye kam se kam ek anuvaanshik pareekshan maujuud he jo sharabipan or ofiumyukt maadak dravya ke nashe se sah-sambandhit he
 Human dopamine receptor genes have a detectable variation referred to as DRD2 taq-i polymorphism
 jin logon main is bahurupata kaa A1 elil hota hai, unamem opiots or sharaab kii tarah endorphin mukt karne vaali maadak dravyon kii lat kii disha main thodaa kam lekin mahatvapurn pravriti hoti he
 While this allele is slightly more common among alcoholics and opiate addicts, it is not itself a sufficient predictor of alcoholism and some researchers argue that the evidence for DRD2 is debatable
 sharaab par nirbharta ke DSM-IV dwaara rog kii pahchaan sharabipan ke paribhaasha kaa ek drushtikon prastut karata he
 To some extent this aids in the development of research protocols in which the findings can be compared with each other
 DSM-IV ke anusaar, sharaab par nirbharta kii ek pahchaan he: There are several reliable tests for the correct intake of alcohol, of which the blood alcohol content test is a common test

 Reliable and evidence-based educational campaigns through mass media about the consequences of alcohol and other drug addiction have also been recommended
 sharaab or anya nashile padaarthon kii lat se hone vaale nuksaan ko rokane ke liye kishoravastha ke dauraan or maansik swasthya samasyaon se peedit yuva logon ko nishaanaa banaakar sharaab or nashile padaarthon ke seven ke bare main mata-pita ko disha-nirdesh dene kaa bhi suzav diya gaya he
 Treatment for alcoholism varies greatly as there are many approaches to the condition itself
 jo log sharabipan ko ek chikitsiya sthiti yaa beemaari ke rup main dekhte hai, ve un logon kii tulana main alag-alag ilaaj kii salaah dete hai, jo, udhaaharan ke taur par, is sthiti ko saamaajik pasand main se ek ke rup main dekhte hai
 Most treatments focus on helping people to stop their alcohol consumption, after which they are provided with life training and / or social support to help prevent them from reverting to alcohol use
 chunki sharabipan main kai kaarak hote hai jo vyakti ko sharaab pinaa jari rakhane ke liye protsaahit karte hai, isliye punaravartan ko safaltaapurvak rokane ke liye in sabhi karkon par dhyaan diya janaa chahie
 is prakaar ke ilaaj kaa ek udhaaharan vishharan he jiske baad sahaayak chikitsa, swa-sahaayak samoohon main upasthiti or parachhati kriyavidhiyon ke chal rahe vikaas ke sangyojan se ilaaj kiya jaataa he
 The treatment of alcoholism community generally supports a moderation-based zero tolerance approach; However, there are also some people who also promote a loss-less attitude
 sharaab vishharan yaa sharaabiyon kaa "vishharan karnaa" nashile padaarthon ke pratisthaapan ke saath yugmit sharaab ke seven kaa ek aakasmik tehraav he, jaise - benzodaseepines, jiske sharaab se vaapasi ko rokane ke ek jaise prabhaav hai
 Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms may be detoxified as outpatients
 jin vyaktiyon ko gambhir vaapasi syndrome kaa khatra hone ke saath-saath jo mahatvapurn yaa teevr ati-aswasth sthiti ke shikaar hote hai, unka ilaaj aam taur par aspataal main rahakar ilaaj karaane vaale rogiyon ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 However, detoxification does not actually cure alcoholism
 isliye punaravartan ke jokhim ko kam karne ke liye vishharan ke saath-saath ilaaj ke upyukt kaarykram kaa bhi kiya janaa aavashyak he
 After detoxification, various forms of group therapy or psychotherapy may be used to deal with underlying psychodynamic issues that relate to alcohol addiction as well as to providing the skills of prevention of relapse
 aapasi-sahaayta vaale samooh-paraamarsh kaa drushtikon sanyam banaae rakhane ke liye sharaabiyon ko madad karne ke sabase aam tareekon main se ek he
 Full moderation is not mandatory in sharing and deployment programs, such as moderation management and drinkwise

 Nowadays medicines prayogtmak davaaiyaan Medications that can make the results worse sharaabiyon ko anya mastishk par prabhaav daalane vaale nashile padaarthon kii lat ke liye bhi ilaaj kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 The most common dual addiction in alcohol dependence is a benzodiazepine dependence, with studies showing that 10 to 20 percent of alcohol dependents have alcohol dependence and / or incorrect intake of benzodiazepines
 sharaab khud ek shaamak-nidrajanak drav he or yah anya shaamak-nidrajanak padaarthon, jaise - barbiturats, benzodaseepines or nonbenzodaseepines, kaa sahansheel-virdohi he
 Dependence on other sedative hypnotics, such as zolpidem and zopiclone, as well as opiates and illegal drugs, is common among alcoholics
 shaamak nidrajanak dawaaiyon par nirbharta or usase chhutkaaraa, jaise - benzodaigepin se chhutkaaraa, sharaab kii tarah hi he or chikitsa kii drushti se gambhir ho saktaa he or yadi sahi tareeke se iskaa intjaam nahin kiya gaya to isse daure or manovikruti kaa bhi khatra he
 Careful reductions in dosage are required for benzodiazepine dependence to avoid severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome and health consequences
 benzodaseepines kii vajah se sharaab kii samasya se jujh rahe sharaab upabhoktaaon main sharaab kii laalasaa main vruddhi hone kii samasya khadi ho jaati he
 Benzodiazepines also increase the amount of alcohol consumed in alcoholics struggling with alcoholism

 "alcohol is the most common substance consumed / relied upon by patients presenting for treatment

 Within the medical and scientific community, there is widespread consensus regarding alcoholism as a condition of the disease
 udhaaharan ke liye, american medical association sharaab ko ek nashili dawa maanata he or kahata he ki "nashili dawa kaa lat aksar vinaashkari parinaam ke baavjood badhyakaari dawa kii maang or upyog kii visheshta vaala ek chirkaalik punrariti vaala mastishk rog he
 It is the result of a complex interaction of biological hypersensitivity, ambient risk and developmental factors
 " Alcoholism is more prevalent among men , although the proportion of female alcoholics has increased in recent decades
 vartmaan sakshya yah suchit karata he ki purushon or mahilaon donon main sharabipan kaa nirdhaaran 50-60 pratishat anuvaanshik aadhaar par hota he or 40-50 pratishat pariveshit prabhaavon ke liye rah jaataa he
 a 2002 study by the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism surveyed a group of 4,422 adults meeting the alcohol dependence criteria, which showed that a year later some met the authors' low-risk drinking criteria
 And although only 25

 Several reasons can be attributed to this, the main reason being that women have less water in their body than men

 Apart from this fact, women may have high intoxication, due to different hormone secretion

 velupillai prabhakaran littey ke netaa tha
 Since the formation of the LTTE around 1975, he was known as the head of the world's most powerful guerrilla fighters
 18 may 2009 ko srilanka kii sena ne unhen maarane kaa daawa kiya he
 Prabhakaran was born on 26 November 1954 in Velvettithurai, a coastal town in Jaffna Island, Sri Lanka
 vah apane mata-pita kii chauthi or sabase choti santan tha
 Prabhakaran was mediocre in studies
 bachapan main uskaa swabhaav sharmila or kitabon se chipke rahane vaale bachche ke rup main tha
 Velupillai Prabhakaran, who had been a ruthless movement for the last three decades to demand a separate Eelam in Sri Lanka, was a firm fighter, but his opponents saw him as an ambitious who never tolerated dissidents
 'thambi' ke rup main kukhyat prabhakaran ek sarkari adhikari kii chauthi santan tha, jisane bachapan main hi skool chhod diya tha
 Prabhakaran was greatly influenced by Napoleon and Sikandar Mahan and had read many of his books
 ek saakshaatkaar main prabhakaran ne iskaa khulaasa kiya tha
 Apart from these, Prabhakaran was also highly influenced by Subhash Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh
 ye donon bhartiya netaa british shashan ke viruddh hinsak sangharsh main vishwaas rakhte the
 Prabhakaran, distraught with Tamils in politics, employment and education, began attending political meetings and received martial arts training
 
 In Sri Lanka, Tamil Hindus are a minority and Christians live in the majority
 aaj tak shri lanka main tamil hinduo ko vot daalane tak kaa adhikaar nahin mila hua he
 Even in the Sri Lankan constitution it is clearly written that Tamil Hindus are second class citizens
 agar ham tamil hinduo par kiye gaay atyaachaaro ko bataane lag jaye to isi vakt hamaara pej band jaayegaa
 Imagine how horrifically Tamilo would have been slaughtered
 isi atyaachaar ke virodh main valipilai prabhakaran ne littey {libresan tiger of tamil ilm } kaa nirmaan kiya
 Hindu Tamils survived only two ways, die as a victim of the atrocities of Christians and die the other way, fighting for the sake of self-respect
 hindu tamilo ne doosraa rasta chunaa or prabhakaran kaa saath dete hue shri lanka ke saath yuddh ched diya
 The LTTE achieved tremendous success in the early decades and partly accepted the Sri Lankan defeat

 In response to which Prabhakaran kills Rajiv Gandhi
 agar us vakt prabhakaran kaa thoda bhi saath diya gaya hota to aaj hindu tamilo kaa ek alag desh hota or shri lanka se ji hajuri nahin kerani padati
 Because then the country of Tamils would have stood with us

 tapas yaa tap kaa mul arth tha prakaash athwa prajvalan jo surya yaa agni main spasht hota he
 But gradually, his orthodoxy developed and the somatic suffering that was taken for the attainment of a particular purpose or for spiritual and physical discipline began to be called austerity
 vastav main tapas kii bhaavana kaa vikaas chaar purushartho or chaar ashramon ke siddhant ke vikaas kaa parinaam tha
 All these thoughts are from the later Vedic era and if there is no special mention of austerities in the Rigveda, then it is not surprising
 haan tapas kaa vah swaroop, jo tantric or guhyak hota he tathaa jiskaa uddeshy duusare ko haani pahunchaana athwa duusare ke akraman se apane ko bachaana hota he, anarya tatwon se shudra avashya prabhavit prathit hota he
 Originally, a monk who wanted to attain salvation was engaged in penance
 brahamnon or upanishdon main uski charchaayen milane lagati hai or brahm kii prapti uskaa uddeshy ho jaataa he
 All renunciation was considered necessary for him and it was understood that in order to be free from the shackles of traffic in the world, not only disinterest, moral life is also necessary
 at: jivan ke sabhi sukhon kaa tyaag hi nahin, sharir ko anek prakaar se jalaana athwa ksht dena bhi prarambh ho gaya
 Some foreign scholars consider the ideas contained in austerities as not Arya and Vedic, as the gift of non-vedic tribals
 kintu yah sahi nahin prathit hota
 The non-aryan and non-vedic elements gradually absorbed into the Shudra class of the Vedic society, which the leaders of the ancient religion and society did not give the right to penance
 vipareet aacharan karne vaale shanbuk jaise tapasvi shudra to dandit bhi hue
 If the ideology of tapas had started with those non-human elements, then this situation would have been impossible
 uddeshyon kii bhinnata se tapasya ke anek prakaar or rup maane gaye
 Vidhyadhyayi Brahmachari, son of a householder desirous of wealth and spiritual pleasures, a seeker of God, absorbed in Brahman and inspired by desire for salvation, a saintly man or woman seeking love, a devotee in God and the Goddess seeking the grace of God, the common man, self-righteousness and ordinary religion Many types of people, who follow ordinary people, meditate in different forms The Sinddhant believe and use it
 tapas kii pravriti kaa centre tha sharir ko ksht dena
 The more multiple forms or stiffness of it, the more the climax of tapas is considered
 saadhaaran tapasvi wo vatkaladasan, bhutishaiya, alpaahar, jatajutdhaaran, nakhvriddhi, vedoccharan, yajyakriyaatmakataa or dayalutaa ke abhyaas maatr tak simit rahata tha, kintu ugr tapasvi garmi kii ritu main panchagni, varsha main khulaavaas, jaade main jalanivaas athwa bhiige kapadon ko pahinakar baahar rahanaa, teen samay snaan, kandamulashan, bhikshatan, basti se dur nivas or sharir ke sabhi sukhon ko tyaag kar use ksht dena tapasya kaa lakshan mana jane laga
 Parvati's penance is the prime example to achieve Shiva
 yahi nahin, ek mudra se, yatha--haathon ko uthaae rakhana, chalate rahanaa athwa isi prakaar ke anya rupakon kaa dhaaran- kuch dinon athwa jivan bhar banaae rakhana tam kii paraakaashtha samajhi jane lagi
 Even today many such ascetic and hathayogis will meet in all corners of India, especially in pilgrimage, ashrams, river banks and mountains
 sarsaadhaaran varg or kabhi kabhi to subodh kintu vishwasi or shraddhalu samaaj bhi, aise tapasviyon kaa aadar karata rahaa he tathaa unamem kisi atimanviya athwa aadhyatmik shakti ke pratishthit hone main vishwaas bhi karata rahaa he
 But it is difficult to say how much faith the intellectual class with critical intelligence has placed on him
 paashchaatya deshon ke log yah maan lete hai ki paurvatyon main kshtsahan or shaarikik taap ko angeekrut kar lene kii aseem kshamta he or ve paradheenata, bhautik atyaachaar or anyaay ke pratikaar main apane ko ksht dekar usase upar uthne athwa bachane kii koshish karte hai
 For this reason from the mind of Shopenhaar, a pessimism and sadism was born in the countries of the East, whose characteristics were the renunciation of the world, the renunciation, the saintly life, the torture of the body and the unnatural and amnological tendency of suppression of desires
 kintu aisa lagata he ki ye vichaarak bhartiya jivan ke lakshyon main arth kaam kii siddhi ke peeche us pravritimulak manovaigyanik or shuddh bhautik vishleshan kaa utana dhyaan nahin karte, jitna nivrittimulak moksh ke bhav or uski prapti ke upayon kaa
 Accordingly, the social analysis of tenacity found in Manusmriti is a concern
 tadnusaar chaaturvarnyon kaa tap dharamshastra vihit unka karmmaatr he, yatha brahman ke dwaara gyaan kii prapti, kshatriya ke dwaara samaaj kii raksha, vaisya ke dwaara krishi, goraksha or vaanijya tathaa shudra ke dwaara dwijatiyon kii seva
 From the social point of view, this religion - performing its duties - was the most important tenacity
 bhagavadgita main to tap or sanyas ke darshanik paksh kaa sarvattam swaroop dikhaai detaa he or uske shareerik, vaachik or maansik tathaa satvik, rajasi or taamasi prakaar bataae gaye hai
 Physical asceticism is rooted in Dev, Dwij, Guru and non-violence, Vachic austerity is by Anudevagarkar Vani, truth and love and speech and self-discipline and mental austerity is proven by happiness, gentleness, self-realization and sentimentation of the mind
 iske saath hi uttam tam to he satvik jo shraddhapurvak fal kii ichha se virakt hokar kiya jaataa he
 Conversely, the princely penance or foolishness which is done for hospitality, honor and worship, by giving many problems to oneself to torment another, is not ideal
 spasht he, bhartiya tapas main jivan ke shaashvat mulyon kii prapti ko hi sarvocch sthaan diya gaya he or nishkaam karm uskaa sabase bada maarg mana gaya he

 This article is about Martin Luther
 martin luther king yaa 'martin luther king junior' alag vyakti hai
 Martin Luther is famous for running a corrective movement in Christianity called Protestism
 ve german bhikshu, dharamshastri, vishvavidhyalay main praadhyaapak, padri evam carch-sudhaarak the jinke vichaaron ke dwaara protestism sudharandolan armbh hua jisane pashchimi europe ke vikaas kii disha badal di
 Luther was born in a city called Iceleven, Germany
 unke pita hens luther khan ke majdoor the, jinke parivaar main kul milakar aath bachche the or martin uski duusari santan the
 At the age of eighteen, Martin Luther joined Erfurt's new university and in 1505 he received his MA
 Got the title of iske baad vah apane pita ke icchaanusaar vidhi kaa adhyayan kane lage kintu ek bhayankar tufaan main apane jivan ko jokhim main samajhakar unhone sanyas lene kii mannath kii
 As a result, he became a member of the Sangh Dharma xxwrep 4 Sanghya in 1505 and in 1507 AD he was given the consecration of the priest
 luther ke adhikari ne unako apane sangh kaa adhyaksh banaan ke uddeshy se unhen vittenberg vishvavidhyalay bheja jahaan luther ko san 1512 i
 main dharmavigyaan main doctorat kii oopaadhi mili
 At the same university he became a professor of Bible and was also appointed to the rank of Provincial Officer of his Union
 luther sheeghra hi apane vyakhyanon main nijee aadhyatmik anubhavon ke aadhaar par bible kii vyakhya karne lage
 At that time there was deep disturbance in his conscience
 ishwar dwaara tehraae hue niyamon ko sahaj rup se puraa karne main apane ko asamarth paakar vah sikhalaane lage ki adipaap ke kaaran manushya kaa swabhaav purna rup se vikrut ho gaya tha 
 The traditional teaching of the Church was that by baptism man is freed from adoration, but Luther believed that after baptism the person remains a sinner and does not earn any virtue through religious works, so he trusts Jesus should keep
 isa ke prati bharosapurna aatmasamarpan ke falswaroop paapi manushya, paapi rahete hue bhi, ishwar kaa kripapaatr banataa he
 These ideas were not compatible with the teaching of the Church, but by 1517 AD Luther revolted against the open-minded Church
 san 1517 kii ghatnaon ko samajhane ke liye "dandamochan" vishyak dharmasiddhant samajhnaa aavashyak he
 The traditional teaching of the church is as follows - The sin of sin is forgiven by true sinners
 kintu paap ke sabhi parinaam nasht nahin hote
 To overcome its consequences, a person has to do penance or suffer punishment
 paap ke un parinaamon ko dur karne ke liye carch paapi kii sahaayta kar saktaa he
 He can pray for her and offer Isa and a portion of his stock of virtuous fruits to the sinner
 carch kii us sahaayta ko indulgens athwa dandamochan kehete hai
 a "sinner" can be found guilty only after he has confessed the sin of sin after confessing and has completed the work of virtue ordained by the church for that punishment
 san 1517 i
 main rome ke sant peter mahamandir ke nirmaan kii aarthik sahaayta karanevaalon ke paksh main ek vishesh dandamochan kii ghoshnaa hui
 Some preachers proclaiming that redemption were less focused on the need to repent for sin and were more focused on collecting money
 usee dandamochan ko lekar luther ne vidroh kiya
 Not only did he condemn the misuse of punishments, he also opposed the doctrine of redemption, and he began to openly teach that the Church or the Pope could not only get rid of the consequences of sin, but only Jesus
 isa manushya ke kisi punya kaary ke kaaran nahin balik apni dayaa se hi paapon se ghrinaa karanevaale logon ko dandamochan pradaan karte hai
 On behalf of Rome, Luther was requested to withdraw his teaching about the execution, but Luther refused to do so and clarified his assumptions in three new compositions
 unhone rome ke adhikaar kaa tathaa purohiton ke avivaahit rahane kii pratha kaa virodh kiya, bible ko chhodkar isai dharm ne koi or aadhaar nahin mana tathaa keval teen sanskaron kaa arthath baptism, papasvikaar tathaa ukharist ko sweekaar kiya
 In the north, Rome announced the exclusion of Luther from the Catholic Church in 1520 AD
 us samay se luther apane nae sampradaay kaa netritv karne lage
 In 1524, he married Catherine Bora
 unka andolan german rashtriyata kii bhaavana se mukt nahin tha or unhen adhikansh german shaskaon kaa samarthan praapt hua
 Probably for this reason, he left the organization of his sect to the rulers excessively
 jab katholic samrat chalrs pancham ne lutheran shaskaon se nivedan kiya ki ve apane-apane kshetron ke katholic isaayiyon ko saarvajanik puja karne kii anumati den tab lutheran shaskaon na us prastaav ke virodh main samrat ke paas ek teevr pratwaad bhej diya or samrat ko jhukna padaa
 Because of this protest, that new religion was named Protestat
 paashchaatya isai dharm ke itihaas main luther kaa sthaan atyant mahatvapurn he
 As a result of his rebellion against the Roman Catholic Church, although the unity of the Western Christian denomination had been dissipated for centuries and remains so till date, it cannot be denied that Luther was an extraordinary genius who was inspired by true religious sentiments
 Was voiced
 bhashaa ke kshetra main bhi luther kaa mahatv adwitiya he
 He composed a number of soulful hymns in the German language and also presented a German translation of the Bible which has Luther's indelible mark on the modern German language
 katholic carch se alag ho jane ke baad luther ne apana adhikansh jivan vittanvarg main bitaa diya jahaan vah vishvavidhyalay main apane vyaakhyaan dete rahe or dharmavigyaan tathaa bible ke vishay main apni bahusankhyak rachanaaon kii sristi karte rahe
 In 1546 AD, he went to Mansfeld for the purpose of resolving a dispute and returning from there, he settled in his birthplace of Isleban
 unke dehanth ke samay westephelia, rinlad or bavaria ko chhodkar samast germany lutheran shaskaon ke haath main thi
 In addition, Lutheranism also spread to nearby countries of Germany and all Christians in Scandinavia became Lutherans

 The main center of Lutheranism is Germany, where fifty-two percent of the people are Lutherans

 It was an organization of guards and subordinates
 raja samast bhoomi kaa swami mana jaataa tha
 The feudal lords were loyal to the king, equipped the army to protect him and in return got land from the king

 In the early period feudalism did commendable service to the society by making proper arrangements for local security, agriculture and justice
 kalantar main vyaktigat yuddh evam vyaktigat swaarth hi saamanton kaa uddeshy ban gaya
 Feudalism disappeared due to the rise of resource-rich new cities, the invention of gunpowder, and the rise of nationalism in place of local royalism
 
 Feudalism in Europe generally flourished under these circumstances

 Italy's villages had become insecure due to the German invasion of barbaric castes, as the government was not able to protect, as a result of which the public compromised the powerful class for their protection

 In Encyclopडियाdia Britannica, there is also a special emphasis on the need for safety

 The need for a power that could provide them protection at any cost was being felt to relieve the possible foreign aggression and uncontrolled demands of government officials
 ’’ The rise of feudalism in Europe has been another tremendous reason

 In this context, Dr
 Ramsharan Sharma can be quoted as saying - "their political and administrative structure was formed on the basis of land grants and the same structure was based on the practice of agricultural slavery
" is pratha ke adheen kisaan bhoomi se bandhe hote the or bhoomi ke maalik ve jameendaar hote the jo asli kaashtkaaron or raja ke bich kadi kaa kaam karte the
 DDR Bhandari also considers "feudalism" as a form of cautious government in which the feudal lords acted

 In Europe, the feudal lords were given land as a reward for their state service, and the entire revenue of the area was under the administrative supervision of those feudals, but they received their lords from their subordinate people regularly

 The duty of the feudal lords was to collect troops for the king

 The protector and the dependent were bound by personal relationships with each other
 sangrakshak apane ashriton kii raksha karata tha tathaa ashriton kii badhati hui sankhya ke kaaran uskaa bal bad jaataa tha
 The second trend was to determine the rights, political place and social status of man
 samantvaad main vyakti ke rajnatik sambandh tathaa uski saamaajik sthiti is baat par nirbhar karti he ki vah kitni bhoomi kaa swami tha
 The third trend was that big Bhupathis started exercising political power in their territories

 He did not get this right from the beginning, due to the weakness of the central power, as his power increased, he increased his authority for the orderliness of his state and started ruling over them

 surdaas kaa naam krishna bhakthi kii ajasr dhara ko pravaahit karne vaale bhakt kaviyon main sarvopari he
 In Hindi literature, Mahatma Surdas, the exclusive worshiper of Lord Shri Krishna and the best poet of Brajbhasha, is considered the Sun of Hindi literature
 hindi kavita kamini ke is kamaneey kaant ne hindi bhashaa ko samrudh karne main jo yogadan diya he, vah adwitiya he
 Surdas is a great poet of the krishna-bhakti sub-branch of the Bhakti Bhakta branch of Hinduism in Hindi literature
 surdaas kaa janm 1478 isvi main runakta naamak gaanv main hua
 This village is situated along the mathura-agra route
 kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki sur kaa janm sihi naamak gram main ek nirdhan saraswat brahman parivaar main hua tha
 Later, they came to live at Gaughat between Agra and Mathura

 There is a difference of opinion about the birth of Surdas
 prarambh main surdaas agra ke sameep gaughat par rahete the
 While there he met Sri Vallabhacharya and became his disciple
 vallabhacharya ne unako pushtimaarg main dikshit kar ke krishnalila ke pad gane kaa aadesh diya
 Surdas died in Parsauli village near Govardhan in 1580 AD
 suraddas bananaa ? Madan Mohan was a young man of very beautiful and sharp intellect, he used to sit by the river every day and write songs
 ek din ek aisa vaakya hua jisane uske man ko moh liya 
 It happened that a beautiful young woman was washing clothes on the river, Madan Mohan's attention went towards her
 us yuvati ne madan mohan ko aisa aakarshith kiya kii vah kavita likhane se ruk gaya 
 And started looking at that girl with full attention
 unako aisa laga maano yamuna kinare radhika snaan kar ke baithi ho 
 That young lady also looked at Madan Mohan and came to him and said, "are you Madan Mohan ji?" So he said yes i am Madan Mohan
 kavitaaye likhata hoon tathaa gaata hoon aapako dekha to ruk gaya 
 Why did the young lady ask? So he said that you are so beautiful
 yah silsilaa kai dinon tak chalaa 
 When Madan Mohan's father came to know about this, he was very angry
 phir madan mohan ne aapane ghar bhi chhod diya 
 But the face of that beautiful young lady was not going in front of him
 One day he was sitting in the temple when he came to a very beautiful married woman
 madan mohan unke peeche peeche chal die 
 When he reached her house, her husband opened the door and placed them inside with full respect
 phir mandon mohan ne do jalati hue silaayaa maangi tathaa use apni aankh main daal di 
 In this way Madan Mohan became the great poet Surdas
 surdaas kii janmatithi evam janmasthan ke vishay main vidwaanon main matbhed he
 "sahitya Lahiri 'is considered a composition written by Sur
 isamen sahitya lahari ke rachana-kaal ke sambandh main nimna pad miltaa he - Its meaning has been assumed in Samvat 1607 AD, hence the creation of "sahitya Lahiri" is Kaal Samvat 1607
 is granth se yah bhi pramaan miltaa he ki sur ke guru shri ballabhacharya the
 Surdas was born around 1535 AD, because there is a belief in Ballabha sect that Ballabhacharya was ten days older than Surdas and Ballabhacharya was born on the Vaishakha Krishna Ekadashi of the said Samvat
 isliye surdaas kii janm-tithi baishakh shukla panchami, sanwat 1535 vi0 samichin jaan padati he
 On the basis of many evidences, his death anniversary is accepted between 1620 and 1648 AD
 ramachandra shukla ji ke matanusaar surdaas kaa janm sanwat 1540 vi0 ke sannikat or mrityu sanwat 1620 isvi ke aasapaas mana jaataa he
 Surdas was 67 years old at that time according to "suresaravali"
 'churaasi vaishnavan kii vaarta' ke aadhaar par unka janm runakta athwa renu kaa kshetra main hua tha
 They resided at Gaughat between Mathura and Agra
 ballabhacharya se inaki bhent vahiin par hui thi
 In "bhavaprakash", the birth place of Sur is described as a village called Sihi
 ve saraswat brahman the or janm ke andhe the
 According to "ain Akbari" and "mutkhabut-tawarikh" Surdas is considered among Akbar's court musicians
 surdaas shrinath kii "sanskritvaarta manipala', shri hariraay krit "bhav-prakaash", shri gokulanath kii "nizvaarta' aadi granthon ke aadhaar par, janm ke andhe maane gaye hai
 But most of the current scholars do not accept Sur as Janmandha due to the qualities of radha-krishna's lively depiction of beauty, description of various colors, subtle observability
 shyamsundar das ne is sambandh main likhaa he - "sur vastav main janmandh nahin the, kyonki shringaar tathaa rang-rupadi kaa jo varnan unhone kiya he vaisaa koi janmandh nahin kar saktaa
 "dr
 Hazariprasad Dwivedi has written -" From some words of Sursagar, the sound must come out that Surdas calls himself blind of birth and unhappy of karma, but all the time, it should not be considered to be prime
 " Five books written by Surdas ji are told: uparokt main antim do aprapya hai
 In the description table of handwritten books published by Nagari Pracharini Sabha, 16 books of Surdas are mentioned
 inamen sursagar, surasaravali, sahitya lahari, nal-damyanti, byaahlo ke atirikt dashamaskandh tikaa, nagalila, bhagwat, govardhan lila, surpachisi, sursagar saar, pranapyari, aadi granth sammilit hai
 Of these, only the first three texts are considered important, in the received copy of Sahitya Lahiri, a lot of eloquence is attached
 " sahitya lahari, sursagar, sur kii saravali
 The writing on the child image of Shri Krishna ji was unique
 
 " sur ke krishna prem or maadhurya pratimurti he
 Whose expression is very natural and alive
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki surdaas hindi sahitya ke mahakavi hai, kyonki unhone na keval bhav or bhashaa kii drushti se sahitya ko susajjit kiya, varan krishna-kavy kii vishisht parampara ko bhi janm diya
 The Bering Ground Bridge or Berinjia was a ground bridge that connected the Siberia region of the far northeast of Asia to the far northwestern Alaska region of North America
 is dharti ke patte kii chaudaai uttar se dakshin tak lagbhag 1,600 kimi thi yani iskaa kshetrafal kaafii bada tha
 During the last ice age, the sea level was below today due to the accumulation of a lot of sea water in the form of ice, due to which Berinjia was a land area
 himyug samaapt hone par bahut si yah barf pighali, samudr-tal uthaa or beringia samudr ke neeche dub gaya
 When Berinjia existed, snowfall was less here due to the favorable regional climate and the atmosphere was like the steppes in Central Asia
 itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki us samay kuch maanav samooh asia se aakar yahan bas gaye
 He could not enter North America further than Berinjia because the great glaciers were blocking his path
 iske baad beringia or asia ke bich bhi ek barf kii diwaar khadi hone se beringia par chand hazaar maanav lagbhag 5,000 saalon tak anya maanvon se bina sampark ke himyug ke bhayankar prakope se bache rahe
 About 16,500 years ago, Himanias started melting and they entered North America
 lagbhag usee samay ke aasapaas beringia bhi pani main doobane laga or aaj se qareeb 6,000 varsh pehle tak taton ke rup vaise ho gaye jaise ki aadhunik yug main dekhe jate hai
 Berinjia was about 4,000 km long and 1,600 km wide
 yah aadhunik siberia kii lenaa nadi se lekar canada kii maikenzi nadi tak pahunchataa tha
 Its area was so large that according to some geologists it was less of a ground bridge and more of a subcontinent
 maimathon ke avasheshon kii haddiyon main maujuud colejan par anusandhan karke vaigyanikon ne yah mat diya he ki pashchimi beringia purvi beringia se zayaada shushk or thanda tha or isliye purvi beringia main praaniyon or paudhon kii adhik samruddhi or vividhta thi
 Berinjia was a large area and most of it was free from Himanias and many animals lived on its steppe-like area
 isliye kuch hazaar maanav bhi yahan rah paae
 It is believed that it lived in Berinjia for 5–17 thousand years and had no contact with other human societies
 kuch itihaaskaaron kaa sochna he ki ek jamaane main beringian maanvon kii pashanyugiya samskruti puure beringia main purv main siberia ke premorye kshetra se lekar pashchim main alaska tak or dakshin main hokkaido tak faili hui thi
 No remains of Berinjians have been found as this entire subcontinent is now submerged under the ocean
 in beringian logon kaa jivan yaqinan kathin tha kyonki yah ek atyant sard ilaaka tha
 It lived a hunter-gatherer biography and would live on average less than 40 years old
 garmiyon main badi taadaad main machhar or anya keet unhen pareshaan karte honge, jaisaa ki siberia main bhi dekha jaataa he
 When the weather changed and their terrain sank, the Berinjians were forced to migrate to North America, they would have had to learn to live afresh in America's separate ab-o-hawa
 2005 main hue ek anuvaanshiki anusandhan se sanket miltaa he ki shaayad 80 se bhi kam beringiaayiyon kaa vansh aadhunik kaal tak chal paaya he, yani anya sabhi kisi-na-kisi musiibat main padakar bina aage vansh chalaae hi khatm ho gaye
 Animals such as camel, mammoth, American lion, horse, deer, sheep, wolf and steppe buffalo were inhabited on Berinjia
 uttar america main hathi, baldaar ganda or singh ab vilupt hai lekin ve isi jamini pul ke zariye asia se vahaan pahunche
 It is also known from the study that the camel origin actually started in North America and the camel passed through Berinjia and reached other parts of Asia and the world
 itihaaskaar andaaza lagate hai ki beringia main maimath jaise bhimkaay jaanwaron ke bich rahakar beringian maanav unke shikaar main maahir ho gaye the
 Later, when it spread to Alaska and other parts of North America, there he continued to hunt these large animals on a large scale with his mastery
 uttar america mahadweep main maimath, mastodon or baldaar gande ke vilupt ho jane kaa yah ek bada kaaran mana jaataa he
