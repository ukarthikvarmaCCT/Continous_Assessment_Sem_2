 jab preston fadar ke saath apane darshakon ke liye pahunchataa he, vah apni talwaar kaa samarpan kar detaa he or ek suraksha poochtacha ke liye ek poligraph mashin se jud jaataa he
 Through a screen, Father talks to Preston, telling him that he knows about Preston's emotion-guilt and that Brandt is arrested for showing Preston engaging in a wrong sense of security, so he Will expose the underground
 The face of the screen changes, now the Vice Council dupont reveals that the real Father is dead many years ago, now the same head of state

 He had stated in his research that some particles are known as baryons and masons, but the presence of some other quarks was also mentioned in his model which contained information about the hypothetical pentaquark
 wig ne aces naamak siddhant ke bare main jaankaree di thi jisamen teen sab-atomic kanon ke bare main bataaya gaya tha
 Accordingly, the presence of protons and neutrons was also reported, but the theory of the gel man was named "quark" which was later recognized

 1000 varsh baad kul bees purush tathaa bees mahilaayein unase prabhavit hue or baanki unke dushman ho gaye
 Noah then prayed to God to save the world
 allaah ne nuh ko ek kashti banaakar saat din baad apane saare shishy tathaa jode pashu pakshiyon ke saath baithne ko kaha, nuh ne aisa hi kiya
 After that, the holocaust started and the earth became pure from sinners and when a new era was established
 us vakt nuh kii umr chah sau varsh thi jab yahova ne unase kaha ki tu ek-jodi sabhi tarah ke praani samet apane saare gharaane ko lekar kashti par savaar ho ja, kyonki main prithvi par jal pralay laane vaala hoon

 The spiritual Holocaust is said to be absorbed in Brahman through the knowledge of yogis
 arthath moksh praapt kar utpatti or pralay chakra se baahar nikal janaa hi atyantik pralay he
 According to Vedanta, the decay or complete destruction of all the three worlds occurring at the end of each kalpa is called the natural disaster
 puraanon anusaar jab brahma kaa ek din samaapt hota he, tab vishwa kaa naash ho jaataa he
 There is a cycle of four thousand yugas

 The eradication, destruction, or incineration of all the land or universe of the universe is called Prakrit Pralaya
 vedant ke anusaar praakrit pralay arthath pralay kaa vah ugr rup jisamen teenon lokon sahit mahatatva arthath prakruti ke pehle or mul vikaar tak kaa vinaash ho jaataa he or prakruti bhi brahm main leen ho jaati he arthath sampurna brahmad shunyavastha main ho jaataa he

 Nothing remains

 At that time, water enters the fire, fire in the air, air in the sky and sky enters into significance

 Out of the above four holocausts, natural and natural systems are related to the universe and the remaining two dooms belong to the incarnations
 adhik jaankaree hetu dekhen - weboduniyaan prishth At the end of every kalpa there is a great disaster
 hamaara ek kalp biit chukaa he jise brahm kalp kehete hai, vartmaan ke kalp ko varah kalp kehete hai jiskaa vartmaan main pratham charan he tathaa bhavishya ke kalp ko padam kalp kehete hai
 One kalpa is said to be equal to four billion thirty-two million human years, it is considered as one day of Brahma or equal to thousand thousand chatyugas
 aadhunik vaigyanikon ke anusaar brahmad kii aayu anumaanath: 13 arab varsh he, 4 arab varsh purv jeevanotpatti maanate he

 After 15 years of Brahma, there is a natural disaster
 brahma kaa ek kalp puraa hone par prakruti, shiv or vishnu kii ek palak gir jaati he
 That is, their one moment is complete, then in the third cataclysm, the cataclysm begins in the dead
 phir jab prakruti, vishnu, shiv aadi kii ek sahasrabar palken gir jaati hai tab ek dand puraa mana gaya he
 One day of such hundred punishments is considered a day of 'nature' - then the fourth holocaust is 'prakrit holocaust' - when nature becomes absorbed in that God
 arthath sampurna brahmad bhasma hokar pun: purv kii avasthaa main ho jaataa he, jabaki sirf ishwar hi vidyaman rah jate hai
 There are neither planets, nor constellations, nor fire, nor water, nor air, nor sky nor life

 It should not be mistaken for deflation, reduction in the rate of inflation

 At the present time, mainstream economists generally believe that deflation is a problem in the modern economy due to the risk of deflationary complications
 apsfiti ko aarthik mandi or vishwavyaapee mandi se bhi joda jaataa he, jaise ki bank jamakartaon kii adaayagi main chook jate hai
 In addition, deflation in the stabilization of the economy hinders monetary policy formulation under a process known as the liquidity trap
 haalanki, aitihaasik rup se apsfiti kii sabhi ghatnaayen, kamjor aarthik vikaas ke daure se judi nahin hai
 The term deflation was used by traditional economists in an alternative sense to refer to the decline in money supply and debt; Some economists, including economists of Austrian ideology, still use the term in the same sense
 ye dono arth ek duusare ke saath sambandhit hai, kyonki mudra kii aapurti saamaanya mulya str main giravat kaa sambhavit kaaran ban jaati he
 In the IS / LM model, deflation occurs due to changes in the supply and demand curve line for goods and interest, especially the overall drop in demand levels
 arthath puri arthvyavastha main kitna kray karne kii ichha main kitni giravat ai he or maal kii keemton main kitni vruddhi hone ja rahi he
 Due to falling commodity prices, consumers are encouraged to delay purchases until prices fall further, in turn reducing overall economic activity by deflationary rotation
 chunki is niskriy kshamta se nivesh main bhi giravat aati he, falswaroop aage chalakar bhi kul maang main katautee kaa kaaran ban jaati he
 This is the deflector winding

 Inflation has the opposite effect and thus there is already a business slowdown
 udhaaharan ke liye, in aavashyak vastuon kii keemten 2008 saal kii vyapaarik mandi se pehle hi aasmaan chune lageen
 In the economic outlook of recent times, deflation is associated with risk: where risk-adjusted returns on assets go down and turn negative, investors and purchasers will raise money and deposit instead of investing in even the most solid securities
 will do
 isse ek aisi saiddhanthik paristhiti paidaa ho sakati he, jisapar chal nidhi ke jaalki vyaavhaarik sambhaavna par kaaphi bahes ho chuki he
 a central bank cannot generally hold negative interest for the currency and even the effect of zero interest often produces less encouraging effects than slightly higher interest rates
 aatanrik arthvyavatha pranali main aisa isliye hota he ki shunya byaaj dhary karne kaa arth sarkari pratibhutiyon par shunya ritern paanaa hoga, athwa alpavadhi kii paripakvata par rinatmak ritern
 khuli arthvyavastha main, yah chal vyapaar ko janm detii he or aayaat ke liye oonchi keemten nirdhaarit kar niryaat ko usee darje tak badhaava diye bina mudra kaa avamulyan karti hai
 In Monetarist theory, deflation is related to a constantly decreasing currency velocity or number of transactions
 iske liye mudra kii aapurti ke naatakeey sankuchan ko jimmedaar tehraaya gaya he, shaayad ghatati hui vinimay dar ke pratyuttar main, athwa swarnamaanak yaa anya bahya maudrik aadharbhoot aavashyaktaaon ke pratyuttar main
 Deflation is generally considered negative, as it leads to the transfer of assets from borrowers and holders of denominated assets, thereby benefiting the accumulators and holders of currency and equitable assets
 is arth main yah mudrasphiti ke thik vipareet he, jo mudra dharakon evam udhaardaataaon ke liye udhaarkartaaon tathaa alpavadhi khapat ke paksh main kar lagane ke samaan he
 In the modern economy, deflation occurs due to the fall in demand and is associated with recession and is associated with long-term economic slowdown
 aadhunik arthvyavastha main, rin kii sharten dderghaayit ho gayi hai or rin ke liye vittaposhan sabhi prakaar ke niveshon ke liye aam he, ab to apsfiti se jude arthdand bhi kaaphi bad gaye hai
 Since deflation discourages investment, as there is no consistent reason to risk future gains while profit expectation is negative and future prices are lower than expected, this is often the reason for sudden demand in aggregate demand
 Fall
 mudrasphiti ke 'chhipe jokhim bina' mudra ko bas pakade rahanaa, ise na to kharch karnaa or na nivesh karnaa, vivekpurna ho saktaa he
 However, deflation is a natural condition in a rare currency economy when the rate of increase in the supply of money is kept in line with the rate of positive population growth
 jab aisa ghatata he, tab prati vyakti par durlabh mudra kii uplabdh raashi ghat jaati he, natijatan mudra or bhi dushprapya ho jaati he; or is kaaran mudra kii prayek ikai kii kray karne kii kshamta bad jaati he
 The last part of the 19th century provides an example of continuous developmental deflation along with economic growth under these circumstances
 jab utpaadan kii kshamta main sudhaar ke samano kii kul keemat main kami paidaa kar detaa he tab bhi apsfiti ghatit hoti he
 The reason for the improvement in production efficiency is usually that economic producers of goods and services are motivated by the promise of increasing profit margins as a result of improvement in production
 bazaar main pratiyogita aksar un utpaadakon ko unken maalon kii munhmaangi keemat ko kam karne ke liye prerit karti he jo inamen se laagat bachat ke bhaag kaa kam se kam kuch ansh usame lagaaein

 When an increase in one's purchasing power of a currency seems beneficial, it can actually create difficulties when a large portion of one's net worth is invested in economical assets such as houses, land and other forms of private property
 yah qarz ke boj ko bhi badhaava detaa he chunki - apsfiti kii kuch mahatvapurn avadhi ke pashchaat - koi karj kii seva ke liye bhugtan karata he to yah kray karne kii ek badi raashi ko darshata he na ki qarz jab pehali baar udbhoot hua tha
 Consequently, deflation can also be considered as an amplification of the shadow of a loan interest rate
 agar sanyukt rajya america kii bhayaavah mandi ke dauraan, apsfiti kaa ausat 10% prativarsh ho jaataa he, to 0% par rin bhi ankarshak ho jaataa he kyonki ise 10% ke adhik laagat mulya par prativarsh chukaaya janaa aavashyak ho jaataa he

 When the short-term interest rate reaches zero, central banks can no longer bring flexibility in their policy by lowering their normal interest rate
 mudra kii aapurti ke viniman kii saamaanya padhdatiyaan aprabhavi ho sakati hai, yahaan tak ki alpaavadhik byaaj dar ko shunya kar dene par bhi parinamswaroop "vaastavik " byaaj dar adhik hi rahegi; atah mudra kii aapurti main vruddhi ke liye anya yuktiyon, jaise ki parisampattiyon kii kharid athwa maatraatmak sahajata, ko kargaar bananaa hoga
 The current president of the United States Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, said in 2002, "substantial injections of currency will ultimately always produce the opposite deflation
" nakad dhan ke samarthakon kaa tark he ki ki agar kisi arthvyavastha main "sakhtiyaan" na ho to, apsfiti ke swaagat yogya prabhaav padane chahie, kyonki keemton main kami karne se arthvyavastha ke prayaas ko anya gatividhi vaale kshetron main sthanantarit kiya ja saktaa he, is prakaar arthvyavastha ke kul utpaada main vruddhi ho sakati he
 This theory has been criticized by some economists, who believe that if there are no strictures, neither inflation nor deflation will have a significant effect
 chunki apsfiti kii avadhiyaan unka samarthan karti hai, jo unke liye mudra dhaaran karte hai jinke paas mudra he hi nahin, tulana aksar badhati hui loklubhaav bhaavana kii samyaavadhiyon se kii jaati he, kyonki 19veen sadi ke ant tak sanyukt rajya america ke janavaadiyon ne durlabh mudra ke maanakon par aadhaarit adhik sphitikaarak chaandi ke dhaatu kii mudraon main karnaa chaha
 The deflationary cycle is a stage when a fall in prices reduces the product, which in turn also reduces wages and demand, leading to a further decline in price
 chunki saamaanya mulya-str main katautiyaan apsfiti kehalaatin hai, atah apsfitikar chakra tabhi paidaa hota he jab keemton main katautee khatarnaak chakra ko janm detii he jahaan samasya swayan hi apane aapako badhaane kaa kaaran ban jaati he
 Some people consider the deflationary cycle to be the cause of the Great Recession
 apsfitikar chakra sachmuch hi vivaadaaspad rup se ghatit hote hai
 The deflationary cycle is the modern version of macroeconomics derived from the bulk of the 19th-century controversies common disputes
 isse sambandhit duusari vichaardhaara irving fisher kaa siddhant he ki atyaadhik rin anwarat apsfiti kaa kaaran ban sakati he
 If excessive inflation destroys the currency, people will move to save their savings in other currencies without delay, which will cause deflation in those other currencies as well
 Alternatively, if policies that bring in high inflation are suddenly reversed, deflation may occur for a short time because by then people will have developed faith in that currency
 arthshaastra kii mukhyadhara main maal kii maang or aapurti tathaa mudra kii maang or aapurti ke sangyojan se apsfiti utpann ho sakati he, visheshrup se tab jab mudra kii aapurti ghatati jaati he or maal kii aapurti badhati jaati he
 Historical cases of deflation have often been related to an increased supply of goods without an increase in the supply of money, or a combination of a decrease in the supply of money with a drop in demand for goods
 mahaan mandi par ben barnanke dwaara kiye gaye adhyayan se yah sanket mila he ki, ghatati hui maang kii main pratikriya main, us vakt fedral reserve ne mudra kii aapurti kam kar di, atah isane apsfiti laane main sahyog pradaan kiya
 Four distinctions of deflation have been described
 do maang ke paksh main hai or do aapurti ke paksh main: In a monetaryist perspective, deflation mainly comes from a decrease in currency velocity and / or the amount of money is determined by the supply of money per capita
 rin par nirbhar aadhunik arthvyavastha main, dwaara ucch byaaj daron kii shuruyaat kar apsfitikar ucchakr utpann ho sakate hai, jisase sambhawatah parisampatti ke bulbule jhatpat tut jaaen athwa niyantrit arthvyavastha charmara jaae jo vastav main jitna sahyog de sakati thi us tulana main utpaadan ke ucch str par kaam kar rahi thi
 In a debt-dependent economy, the decline in the money supply significantly reduces lending, leading to a rapid decline in the money supply, and also a subsequent demand
 maang main giravat aati he or maang kii giravat ke saath-saath, keemten ghat jaati hai kyonki aapurti kii prachurtaa viksit hoti he
 When deflation costs fall below the cost of production, this deflation becomes high

 Since mortgage lending banks have received assets whose value has fallen dramatically since mortgage lending and even if they sell those assets, they further hamper the re-supply, Which only spoil the situation

 In a volatile currency economy, barter and other alternative currency regimes such as dollarisation are common and that is why commerce can continue even when the government currency depreciates
 Since the central government is often incapable in such an economy and even if it wants to control the internal economy in a sufficient manner, there is a great need for the common people to get government money in addition to paying the imported goods

 a similar situation began in Japan in the early 1990s with the collapse of the stock and real estate market, which was prevented by the Japanese government from taking over most banks and many of them, which were in bad shape, directly Taking control was controlled

 Some economists argue that the economic recession after 2000 years was undergoing a period of time when the United States was at risk of severe deflation and that is why the Federal Reserve has been "moderate" since 2001 by the Central Bank on interest rates
 "it was right to be controlled with stance

 With the rise of currencyist ideas, the focus was on disseminating demand by reducing interest rates to fight deflation
 This thinking suffered a setback in view of the failure of liberal policies to stimulate demand in both Japan and the United States when the stock market suffered a setback in the early decades of 1990 and between 2000–2002

 is vyavastha kaa durupyog na ho, is drushti se talaak kaa adhikaar anek pratibandhon ke saath vishesh avasthaa main hi diya jaataa he
 Adultery is the mainstay of divorce as it is at the root of marital life
 iske atirikt kuch anya kaaran bhi he
 From the time of Plato, thinkers have been imagining the abolition of marriage practice and the rearing of children by the state
 vartmaan samay ke audyogic evam vaigyanik parivartanon se tathaa pashchimi deshon main talaakon kii badhati hui bhayaavah sankhya ke aadhaar par vivaah kii sanstha ke lop kii bhavishyavaanee karanevaalon kii kami nahin he
 There is no doubt that the traditional forms of marriage are currently undergoing major changes due to several reasons
 vivaah ko dharmik bandhan ke sthaan par kanoonee bandhan tathaa pati-patni kaa nijee maamla maanane kii pravriti bad rahi he
 Women are becoming financially independent from the industrial revolution and the spread of education
 pehle unke sukhmay jeevanyaapan kaa ekmaatr saadhan vivaah tha, ab aisi sthiti nahin rahi
 The new laws of marriage and divorce are equating the rights of Narnari with marriage rights
 dharm ke prati aasthaa main shithilataa or garbhanirodh ke sadhano ke avishkaar ne vivaah vishyak puraani manyataon ko, pragvaivaahik satitv or pavitrataa ko gaharaa dhakka pahunchaaya he
 But despite all these changes, the main reason for the continuation of the marriage process in the future is that it fulfills some purposes which cannot be done by any other means or institution
 pehla prayojan vanshavriddhi kaa he
 Although science has invented artificial insemination, the production and development of infants in laboratories artificially does not seem possible
 doosraa prayojan santan kaa paalan he, rajya or samaaj shishushaalaon or balodyanon kaa kitna hi vikaas kar le, unamem inke sarvangin samuchit vikaas kii waisi vyavastha sambhav nahin, jaisi vivaah evam parivaar kii sanstha main hoti he
 The third purpose is true love and happiness
 yah bhi vivaah ke atirikt kisi anya saadhan se sambhav nahin
 In order to fulfill these purposes, marriage will continue to be an important institution even if some changes are made in it

 Siachen's Front is also a similar front in which Naib Subedar Bana Singh of the Eighth Squad of Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry was given Paramveer Chakra by the Government of India for his cleverness, valor and courage
 bahadur bana singh kaa janm 6 janvari 1949 ko jammu or kashmir ke kadyaal gaanv main hua tha
 On 6 January 1969, his military life began in the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry
 shri singh ko sammaan dene va unki veerta ko yaad rakhane ke liye siachin main jis chaowkee ko bana singh dwaara fatah kiya gaya tha uskaa naam bana post rakh diya gaya
 Bana Singh found Paramveer Chakra for this action

 Situated at an altitude of 21 thousand one hundred and fifty three feet from the sea coast, where the winds are moving at a speed of 40 to 60 kilometers per hour, and where the maximum temperature is -35 ° C, about the conditions
 Can i guess? lekin yah sach he ki yah bharat ke liye ek mahatvapurn jagah he
 In fact, after the Karachi Agreement in 1949, when the ceasefire was drawn, it extended from Khor in the north to Khor in the south, in the Jammu and Kashmir region

 In this area, a straw does not grow, even breathing is extremely difficult due to the cold weather
 lekin kuch bhi ho, yah thikaana aisa he jahaan bharat, pakistan or china kii seemayen milti he, isliye suraksha kii drushti se iskaa vishesh mahatva he
 As always, the encroachment and abetment proceedings were also carried out here by Pakistan

 In addition, he invites foreign climbers to the area and outsiders for scientific tests, even when it is not his area
 iske atirikt bhi uski ore se anek aisi yojanaon kii khabar aati rahati he jo atikaraman tathaa aapattijanak kahi ja sakati he
 The incident we are specifically mentioning here is from the year 1987
 isamen pakistan ne siachin glacier par, bhartiya seemaa ke andar apni ek chaowkee banane kaa aadesh apni senaaon ko de diya
 The place was also reserved from India, given the weather
 vahaan par pakistan sainikon ne apni chaowkee khadi kii or 'kaayad chaowkee' kaa naam diya
 The name was named after the father of Pakistan quaid-azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah
 us chaowkee kii sanrachana samajhnaa bhi bada rochak he
 The outpost was built like a fort above the glacier, with walls of snow 1500 feet high on either side
 ise pakistan ne apni yah chaowkee 'kaayad' badi chunauti kii tarah, bharat kii seemaa ke bheetar banaai thi, jise atikaraman ke alaava koi or naam nahin diya ja saktaa
 Obviously, it was not possible for India to sit silent on the information of this incident
 bhartiya sena ne yah prastaav banaaya ki hamen is chaowkee ko vahaan se hataakar us par apana kabja kar lenaa he
 In response to this proposal, Naib Subedar Bana Singh himself went ahead and said that he will go and complete this work

 They were allowed to do this
 naayab soobedaar bana singh ne apane saath chaar saathi or liye or apane lakshya kii ore bad liye
 According to the plan, the other battalions continued to confuse the soldiers of Pakistan's enemy and on the other hand Bana Singh and his comrades started the work of reaching that outpost
 'kaayad post' kii sapaat diwaar par, jo ki barf kii baniin thi, us par chadhana behad kathin or jokhim bharaa kaam tha
 Even before this, Indian soldiers tried to climb this wall many times and were unsuccessful

 The guns were also not working properly due to the severe cold

 On the way, he also saw the bodies of those Indian bravehearts who lost their lives on the way to reach here
 jaise-taise bana singh apane saathiyon ko lekar thik upar tak pahunchne main kaamyaab ho gayi
 Arriving there, he divided his team into two parts and deployed them in two directions and then started throwing grenades at that 'qaid post'
 vahaan bane banksron main grenade ne apana kaam dikhaaya
 Simultaneously the soldiers of the other party started killing the enemy soldiers who were at the checkpoint from the benets

 Four track paths are used to keep these stairs flat
 seedhi ke donon siron par do do patariyon kaa joda hota he, jo seedhi se lage hue pahiyon ko is prakaar sanbhaale rahata he ki aage badhati hui seedhi har disha main samtal rahati he
 For climbing and descending at the beginning and end, the tracks are laid in such a way that the stairways join one by one to form a straight platform, from which people can easily descend and move
 yahan yah aavashyak he ki aage badhate hue chabutare se sthir chabutare par surakshit rup se pahunchaa ja sake
 Two methods are used for this
 ek to chalate hue chabutare or sthir chabutare ke bich main ek tirchhi munder lagi rahati he, jisase yadi koi chalate hue chabutare se na utre to munder se halkaa sa dhakka lagane ke kaaran sthir chabutare par pahunch jaataa he
 In the other way, the platforms are made of serrated grooves and the running platforms are stuck in the platforms of the stationary platforms so that the person standing on the platform easily reaches the stationary platform while walking

 Mobile stepping is more beneficial than lifting, because it can work continuously for many lifters simultaneously, because it can work continuously in one direction
 iske chalaane kaa kharch bhi utthapak kii tulana main kam baithta he, par yah saadhaarant: 60 foot kii oonchaai tak hi kaary kar saktaa he
 Therefore, where high altitude work is done, either the lifters are used only or two or more movable steps are required, which takes longer time to climb
 chal sopan kii saamaanya chaudaai aavashyaktaanusaar do, teen yaa chaar foot rakhi jaati he
 Approximately 8,000 humans can be transported per hour by a step foot of four feet wide and 90 feet per minute working at an angle of 30 degrees

 Five feet wide running steps are used at big stations and places of high traffic, in which three people can stand on each ladder
 is prakaar inke dwaara ek ghante main 12,000 vyakti chadh sakate hai
 If the passengers also start climbing on their own, this number can increase by 40 percent

 genetic elgorithm ek search takanic he jiskaa upyog ishtatameekaran tathaa khojane kii samasyaon ke liye sateek yaa sannikat hal praapt karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 This algorithm is one of many developmental algorithms
 vikasaatmak kalanvidhiyaan, vikaswad tathaa usase sambandhit avadharanaon takneekon ke anusaran par aadhaarit hai
 The implementation of a genetic algorithm is performed in a computer simulation, in which a population of an abstract representation or a chromosome of what is called a candidate's solution for optimizing a problem) develops a better solution
 paramparaagat rup se, samaadhaan ko 0 or 1 kii shrinkhalaa ke rup main dwiadhari main vyakt kiya jaataa he, lekin anya encoding bhi sambhav he
 Development usually begins with randomly generated individuals and occurs in generations
 prayek peedhee main, prayek vyakti kii fitness kaa moolyankan kiya jaataa he, vartmaan aabaadi se stocastic rup se kai vyaktiyon kaa chayan kiya jaataa he or nayi aabaadi ke nirmaan ke liye unamem sanshodhan kiya jaataa he 
 The new population is then used in the next step of the algorithm
 saamanytah, elgorithm tab khatm hota he jab yaa to pidhiyon kii adhiktam sankhya utpann ho chuki ho yaa aabaadi ke liye ek santoshjanak fitness kaa str praapt kiya ja chukaa ho
 If the algorithm is terminated by the maximum number of generations, a satisfactory solution may or may not be achieved
 anuvanshik elgorithm jaev soochna, filogenetics, computesnal vigyaan, abhiyantriki, arthshaastra, rasayan vigyaan, vinirmaan, ganit, bhautikee or anya kshetron main anuprayog praapt karata he
 a typical genetic algorithm is required: samaadhaan kaa ek maanak pratinidhitiv bit kii ek ere he
 Arrays of other types and structures can be used in essentially the same way
 mukhya gun jo in anuvanshik pratinidhitivon ko suvidhajanak banaata he, vah yah he ki unke bhaag unke nishchit aakaar ke kaaran aasaani se sanrekhit ho jate hai, jo saadhaaran crosover kriyavidhi ko aasaan banaata he
 The variable length representation can also be used, but in this case the crossover implementation becomes more complex
 vriksh ke prakaar ke pratinidhitiv anuvanshik programing main prakat hote hai or pratinidhitiv se praapt graph vikasvaadi programing main prakat hote hai
 The fitness function is defined on the genetic representation and measures the quality of the solution represented
 fitness function hameshaa samasya par nirbhar karata he
 For example, in the knapsack problem one wants to maximize the total value of an object that can be placed in a knapsack of a certain capacity
 ek samaadhaan kii abhivyakti bits kii ek ere ho sakati he, jahaan prayek bit ek bhinn object ko abhivyakt karata he or bit kaa maan abhivyakt karata he ki object nepsek main he yaa nahin
 Not every such expression is valid, because the size of the object exceeds the capacity of the knapsack is unity
 samaadhaan kii fitness nepsek main sabhi objects ke maan ke yoga ke baraabar he yadi abhivyakti maanya he yaa anyathaa 0 he
 In some problems, it is either difficult or impossible to define an expression of fitness; In these cases, interactive genetic algorithms are used
 ek baar jab ham anuvanshik abhivyakti or fitness function ko paribhaashit kar lete hai, GA samaadhaan kii aabaadi ko shuru karne ke liye aage badhata he, phir utparivartan, crosover, utkraman or chayan operataron ke madhyam se isamen sudhaar karata he
 Initially several individual solutions are randomly generated to form an initial population
 aabaadi kaa aakaar samasya kii prakruti par nirbhar karata he, lekin isamen praroopik rup se kai sankadon hajaaron sambhav samaadhaan hote hai
 Traditionally, populations are generated randomly and cover the full range of possible solutions
 Sometimes, solutions can be "started" in areas where optimal solutions are likely to be found
 prayek agali peedhee ke dauraan, ek nayi peedhee ke prajnan ke liye maujuuda aabaadi ke ek anupaat kaa chayan kiya jaataa he
 Individual solutions are selected through a fitness-based process, where typically more fit solutions are more likely to be selected
 vishisht chayan vidhiyaan prayek samaadhaan ki fitness ko nirdhaarit karti hai or sarvottam samaadhaan ke chunaav ko praathamikta detii hai
 Other methods determine only a random sample of the population, as this process may take too long
 adhikansh function stocastic hote hai or unhen is prakaar se dizin kiya jaataa he ki kam feet samaadhaan ke ek chote anupaat kaa chayan kiya jaye
 yah bure samaadhaan par samay purv abhisaran ko rokte hue, aabaadi kii vividhta ko bada banane main madad karata he
 Popular and well-selected methods include Roulette Wheel Selection and Tournament Selection
 anuvaanshik oparator ke madhyam se chayan kiye gaye samaadhaan kii duusari peedhee kii aabaadi ko utpann karne kaa aglaa charan he: crossover bhi kehalaata he) or / yaa utparivartan 
 For each new solution to be generated, a pair of "parent" solutions is selected, so as to breed from the pool previously selected
 Using the above method of cross-over and mutation, a new solution is produced by producing a "child or child" solution, which typically has many of the characteristics of its "parent"
 prayek bachche ke liye nae janak kaa chayan kiya jaataa he or yah prakriya tab tak jari rahati he jab tak upyukt aakaar ke samaadhaan kii ek nayi aabaadi utpann nahin ho jaati he
 Although breeding methods that are based on the use of two parents are "more inspired by biology", recent research suggests that using more than two "parents" to breed a good quality chromosome Is better for in prakriyaaon ke parinamswaroop antat gunasutron kii agali peedhee kii aabaadi utpann hoti he jo praarambhik peedhee se alag hoti he
 Typically this process will increase the average fitness for the population, since only the best organisms are selected for reproduction from the first generation, with a small proportion of less fit solutions taken, the reasons for the above
 Huh
 pidhiyon kii is prakriya ko tab tak doharaaya jaataa he jab tak ek samaapti kii sthiti nahin aa jaati he
 The general conditions for termination are: anuvanshik elgoritham ke madhyam se samaadhaan kii peedhee ke bare main kai saamaanya prekshan hai: Very expensive fitness function evaluations are often required to find solutions to complex high dimensional, multimodal problems
 asli duniya kii samasyaon jaise sanrachanaatmak anukulan samasyaon main, ekmaatr function moolyankan ke liye purna simulation ke kai ghanton se kai dinon tak kii zarurat ho sakati he
 Typical optimization method cannot deal with this type of problem
 is maamle main, sambhavatya yah jaruri ho saktaa he ki ek sateek moolyankan ko chhod diya jaye or ek aise sanniktan fitness kaa prayog kiya jaye jo sanganana kii drushti se prabhavi he
 It appears that the blending of adjacent samples may be one of the most promising approaches that deliberately uses EA to solve complex real-life problems
 iskaa arth yah he ki yah nahin jaanata he ki dirghakaalik fitness praapt karne ke liye alpakaalik fitness kaa balidaan kaise diya jaye
 is ghatana kii sambhaavna fitness landscape ke aakaar par nirbhar karti he: vishisht samasyaayein ek vaishvik anukulata ke prati ek aasaan chadhai ko uplabdh karaati hai, anya sthaneey anukulata kii khoj ke liye function hetu ise aasaan banaate hai
 This problem can be alleviated by the use of a different fitness function, by increasing the rate of mutation, or by using selective techniques that maintain a diverse population of solutions, although the No Free Lunch Theorem proves that There is no general solution to the problem
 vividhta ko banaaye rakhane kii ek saamaanya takanic he ek "neeche penlti " ko adhyaropit karnaa, jisamen, paryaapt samanta ) ke vyaktiyon ke kisi samooh main atirikt penlti hoti he, jo aane vaali pidhiyon main us samooh kii abhivyakti ko kam karegi, jisase jansankhya main anya vyaktiyon ko banaaye rakhaa ja sake
 yah daanv, tathaapi, is samasya ke paridrishy ke aadhaar par prabhavi nahin ho sakati he
 Diversity is important in genetic algorithms because the crossing over of a homogeneous population does not provide new solutions
 vikaas ranneetiyon or vikaas programing main, utparivartan par adhik nirbharta ke kaaran vividhta jaruri nahin he
 Several methods have been proposed as a remedy for this, such as increasing genetic diversity in some way and preventing early convergence, either by increasing the probability of mutation when the quality of the solution drops, or ever Ever through completely new, randomly generated elements in the gene pool
 Implemented development strategies and developmental programming with a so-called "coma strategy"
 Can be, in which parents are not maintained and the choice of new parents are made only child
 yah gatisheel samasyaon par adhik prabhavi ho saktaa he
 In these cases, a random search can find a solution as quickly as a GA
 However, if the situation is such that the success / failure test is repeated giving different results, then the ratio of success and failure provides an appropriate fitness measure
