 This rebellion lasted for two years in different regions of India
 is vidroh kaa aarambh chhavnee kshetron main choti jhadpon tathaa aagjanee se hua tha parantu janvari maas tak isane ek bada rup le liya
 The end of the revolt coincided with the end of the East India Company's rule in India and the British Crown's direct rule over the whole of India began for the next 90 years
 east india company ne robert clive ke netritv main san 1757 main plasi kaa yuddh jeeta
 In the post-war treaty, the British got the right to tax-free trade in Bengal
 san 1764 main baxur kaa yuddh jeetne ke baad angrejon kaa bengal par puri tarah se adhikaar ho gaya
 The victory in these two wars greatly increased the strength of the British and proved their military capability superior to the traditional Indian military capability
 company ne iske baad saare bharat par apana prabhaav failaana aarambh kar diya
 In 1843, the East India Company took possession of the Sindh region after a bloody battle
 san 1839 main maharaja ranjit singh kii mrityu ke baad kamjor hue punjab par angrejon ne apana haath badhaaya or san 1848 main doosraa angrej-sikh yuddh hua
 In 1849, the company also took control of Punjab
 san 1853 main aakhri maratha peshwa baaji raav ke dattak putr naanaa sahib kii padavi chin lee gayi or unka vaarshik kharchaa band kar diya gaya
 Berar in 1854 and Awadh were merged with the Company in 1856
 san 1857 ke vidroh ke vibhinn rajnatik, aarthik, dharmik, sainik tathaa saamaajik kaaran bataaye jate he Many historians believe that there was a belief in the public at that time that the British want to Christianize them by force or deception
 yah puri tarah se galat bhi nahin tha, kuch company adhikari dharm parivartan ke kaary main jute the
 However the company never approved the conversion
 company is baat se avgat thi ki dharm, parmparik bhartiya samaaj main vidroh kaa ek kaaran ban saktaa he
 Earlier, one of the reasons for the decline of the Portuguese from India and Japan in the sixteenth century was that they had tried to force Christianity on the masses
 lord dalhousie kii rajya hadapney kii naati ke antargat anek rajya jaise jhansi, avadh, satara, nagpur or sambalpur ko angreji rajya main mila liya gaya or inke uttaradhikari raja se angreji rajya se pension paane vaale karmchaaree ban gayi
 The royal families, zamindars and armies found themselves unemployed and marginalized
 ye log angrejon ke haathon apni sharmindagi or haar kaa badla lene ke liye taiyaar the
 In the eight years of Lord Dalhousie's rule, the area of one million square miles was taken over by the company
 iske atirikt east india company kii bengal sena main bahut se sipaahi avadh se bhartee hote the, ve avadh main hone vaali ghatnaon se achoote nahin rah sake
 The event, which was spoken in Calcutta by the royal family of Nagpur, was seen as a disrespect to the royal family
 bhartiya, company ke kathor shashan se bhi naaraaz the jo ki teji se fail rahaa tha or pashchimi sabhyta kaa prasar kar rahaa tha
 The British outlawed many of the customs of Hindus and Muslims at that time which were considered antisocial by the British
 isamen sati pratha par roak lagaana shaamil tha
 It is worth noting here that the Sikhs had stopped this long ago and the famous social reformer of Bengal, King Rammohan Roy was campaigning in favor of discontinuing the practice
 in kanoonon ne samaaj ke kuch pakshon mukhyatah bengal main krodh utpann kar diya
 The British abolished child marriage and also prohibited female feticide
 angrejon dwaara thagi kii samaapti bhi kii gai parantu yah sandeh abhi bhi bana hua he ki thag ek dharmik samudaay tha yaa keval saadhaaran dakaiton kaa samudaay
 The British judicial system was considered unjust to Indians
 san 1853 main britain ke pradhanmantri lord abradin ne prashasnic seva ko bharatiyon ke liye khol diya parantu kuch prabud bharatiyon ke hisaab se yah sudhaar paryaapt nahin tha
 The officers of the company were empowered with a number of appeals against Indians in courts
 company bharatiyon par baari kar bhi lagaati thi jise na chukaane kii sthiti main unki sampatti adhigrahit kar lee jaati thi
 Modernization efforts of the company were viewed with suspicion in traditional Indian society
 logo ne mana ki railway jo bambai se sarvapratham chalaa ek daanav he or logo par vipatti laayegaa
 But many historians also believe that these reforms have been exaggerated because the company did not have the means to implement these reforms and their influence away from Calcutta was negligible
 1857 ke vidroh kaa ek pramukh kaaran company dwaara bharatiyon kaa aarthik shoshan bhi tha
 The policies of the company completely ended India's traditional economy
 in nitiyon ke kaaran bahut se kisaan, karigar, shramik or kalakaar kangaal ho gayi
 Along with them the situation of the landlords and big farmers also got worse
 san 1813 main company ne ek tarafa mukt vyapaar kii niti apana lee iske antargat britani vyapaariyon ko aayaat karne kii puri chhot mil gayi, paramparaagat takanic se bani hui bhartiya vasteen iske saamne tik nahin saki or bhartiya shahari hastshilp vyapaar ko acolpaneey kshati hui
 With the arrival of the railway service, small enterprises in the rural areas were also destroyed
 rail seva ne britani vyapaariyon ko dur daraaj ke gaavon tak pahunch de di
 The textile industry suffered the most
 iske saath loha vyapaar, bartan, kaanch, kaagaj, dhaatu, bandook, jahaaj or rangareji ke udyogon ko bhi bahut kshati hui
 In the 18th and 19th centuries, Indian exports came to an end due to import tax and many barriers in Britain and Europe
 parmparik udyogon ke nasht hone or saath saath aadhunik udyogon kaa vikaas na hone kii kaaran yah sthiti or bhi visham ho gayi
 The general public has no means other than farming
 kheti karne vaale kisaano kii haalat bhi kharaab thi
 In the beginning of British rule, the peasants were left at the mercy of the zamindars, who greatly increased the rent and started exploiting the peasants by forced labor and other methods
 company ne kheti ke sudhaar par bahut kam kharch kiya or adhiktar lagaan company ke kharchon ko puraa karne main prayog hota tha
 In the event of crop failure, the moneylenders loaned the farmers more interest and cheated the illiterate farmers in many ways
 britani kanoon vyavastha ke antargat bhoomi hastantaran vaid ho jane ke kaaran kisaanon ko apni bhoomi se bhi haath dhonaa padataa tha
 Due to these problems there was dissatisfaction among every section of the society
 san 1848 or 1856 ke bich lard dalhoji ne doctrin ouf laps ke kanoon ke antargat anek rajyon par adhikaar kar liya
 According to this theory, a state, territory or area of british influence will become subject to the company, if the king of the region dies without permission or the ruler is disqualified in the eyes of the company
 is siddhant par kaary karte hue lard dalhoji or uske uttaradhikari lard cannig ne satara,nagpur,jhansi,avadh ko company ke shashan main mila liya
 Political credibility of the company was also questioned due to the treaties and promises made by the company
 san 1849 main lard dalhoji kii ghoshnaa ke anusaar bahadur shah ke uttaradhikari ko aitihaasik laal kila chhodana padega or shahar ke baahar janaa hoga or san 1856 main lard cannig kii ghoshnaa ki bahadur shah ke uttaradhikari raja nahin kahalaayenge ne mughalon ko company ke vidroh main khada kar diya
 The soldiers were originally soldiers of Indian origin who worked in the company's Bengal Army
 bombay, madras or bengal presidensi kii apni alag sena or senapramukh hota tha
 This army had more soldiers than the British army
 san 1857 main is sena main 2,57,000 sipaahi the
 The army of Bombay and Madras Presidency, being a people of different regions, these forces were full of diversity and did not have the dominion of the people of any one region
 parantu bengal presidensi kii sena main bhartee hone vaale sainik mukhyat: avadh or ganga ke maidani ilaako ke bhoomihaar brahman or rajput the
 In the early years of the company, caste privileges and customs were given importance in the Bengal Army, but after 1840, after the coming of modern government in Calcutta, there was a fear of losing the caste among the soldiers
 sena main sipaahiyon ko jati or dharm se sambandhit chinh pahanane se manaa kar diya gaya
 In 1856, under an order, all newly recruited soldiers were made mandatory to work abroad for some time
 sipaahi dhire-dhire sena ke jivan ke vibhinn pahaluon se asantusht ho chuke the
 The salary of the army was low
 bhartiya sainikon kaa vetan mahaj saat rupaye pratimah tha
 And after winning Awadh and Punjab the sepoys' allowance was also abolished
 enfield bandook ke bare main faili afvaahon ne sipaahiyon kii ashnka ko or badhaa diya ki company unki dharm or jati parivartan karnaa chaahati he
 The revolt began due to a gun
 sipaahiyon ko pattesion 1853 enfield bandook di gayin jo ki 0
577 calibar kii bandook thi tathaa puraani or kai dashakon se upyog main laayi ja rahi brown bas ke mukaable main shaktishaalee or achook thi
 The modern system of firing in the new gun was used, but the process of firing in the gun was old
 nayi enfield bandook bharne ke liye kaartoos ko daanton se kaat kar kholana padataa tha or usame bhare hue barud ko bandook kii nalee main bhar kar kaartoos ko daalana padataa tha
 The outer shell of the cartridge contained grease which protected it from water sealing
 sipaahiyon ke bich afawaah fail chuki thi ki kaartoos main lagi hui charbi suar or gaay ke maance se banaayi jaati he
 This was against the religious sentiments of both Hindu and Muslim soldiers
 British officials called it a rumor and suggested that soldiers make new cartridges in which goat or bee fat should be used
 is suzav ne sipaahiyon ke bich faili is afawaah ko or pukhta kar diya
 Another suggestion was that the soldier open the cartridge with his hands instead of cutting through the teeth
 parantu sipaahiyon ne ise ye kehete hue asvikaar kar diya ki ve kabhi bhi nayi kavayad ko bhul sakate hai or daanton se kaartoos ko kaat sakate hai
 The then British Army Chief George Enson, bypassing the advice of his officers, solved the problem arising out of this exercise and new gun

 According to General Jan Heyerseye Mangal Pandey was in some kind of religious madness
 The General ordered Jamadar Ishwari Prasad to arrest Mangal Pandey but the Zamidar refused
 sivaay ek sipaahi shaikh palatu ko chhod kar sari regiment ne mangal pandeya ko giraftaar karne se manaa kar diya
 Mangal Pandey told his comrades to openly rebel but when no one believed, he tried to take his life with his gun
 parantu ve is prayaas main keval ghayal huye
 Mangal Pandey was court martialed on 6 April 1857 and hanged on 8 April

 All regiments were abolished and soldiers were expelled

 The soldiers of other regiments found this punishment very harsh

-colonel George Carmichael Smith, asked his 90 soldiers to parry and practice shelling
 paanch ko chhod kar sabhi sipaahiyon ne parade karne or kaartoos lene se manaa kar diya
 On 9 May, 85 soldiers were court martialed by the military court, most of the soldiers were sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment

 The cause of many incidents in these was the behavior of the British authorities which spread the chaos

 anya deshon kii bhanti burma kaa bhi apana sahitya he jo apane main purna evam samrudh he
 The rise of Burmese literature has often taken place in the court of kings who encouraged poetry, so the relation of human poets of Burmese literature with the great Mahipals is established
 rajasi vaataavaran main abhyuday evam prasar paane ke kaaran burmi sahitya atyant sushlisht tathaa prabhaavshaalee ho gaya he
 Burmese literature includes translations of Buddhist texts, attakathas and commentaries
 burmi bhashaa main gadhy or padya donon prakaar kii sahitya vidhaayen moulik rup se milti hai
 It also has translations of Ayurvedic texts
 pali sahitya ke prabhaav se isaki style bhartiya he tathaa boli apni he
 The technical and fundamental terms of Pali are found in Burmese form in this language
 ras, chand or alankaaron kii yojana pali evam sanskrit se prabhavit he
 Keeping in mind the development of Burmese literature, scholars have divided it into nine periods, each with its own characteristic of literature
 is yug ke sahitya kaa gyaan shilalekhon dwaara hota he, jinaki rachana saral tathaa alankaraviheen he
 The oldest inscription found in that period is the Meezetti, which was excavated in 1112 by a prince named Rajkumar
 usamen burmi bhashaa ke atirikt pali, moon, pru, in teen bhashaaon kaa prayog bhi miltaa he
 This makes it known that those languages were also prevalent in that period
 uske baad 1224 i

 It is called Shin Pin Bodhi inscription
 tadnantar rajkumaari thingthu kaa min vain lekh, tathaa maharani fwaso kaa shilaalekh bhi ulalekhneey he
 In terms of language and sentiment, the later inscriptions are better than the earlier ones
 yadhyapi is yug main gadhypadyatmak sahitya shaastra kii uplabdhi nahin hoti, phir bhi inkaa nirmaan avashya hone laga tha, kyonki anantsoorya kaa kavy aaj bhi burma main prachlit he
 Pali began to have a tremendous impact on Burmese literature due to the greater study of Tripitaka by Burmese kings
 is yug main burmi sahitya kii unnati pagan yug se adhik hui
 With more study of Tripitaka, Burmese literature began to enter rasa, alankar etc
 directly from the lobe
 darshan kaa vivechan hone se sahitya main gambhirtha bhi aane lagi
 In this era, the poetry of a minister named Chaturangabal is more advanced than the Pagan era in both the figure of speech and the rasa
 is yug main bhi shilaalekh milte hai jo pagan yug ke shilalekhon kii apeksha bhashaa kii drushti se adhik samrudh hai
 This era is called the golden period of Burmese literature
 jis prakaar kalidas aadi sanskrit ke kaviyon ne apni rachana kaa aadhaar ramayana or mahabharat aadi ko banaaya, usee prakaar burmi sahityakaron ne apni kavyrachanaon kaa aadhaar pali sahitya ko banaaya
 At the same time many new literary works like epic, Khandakavya and drama were produced
 inkaa sahitya hriday kii anubhutiyon kaa pratik he tathaa bhav kii garima ke kaaran pad main bhi laalitya evam madhurima aa gai he
 Monks are more among the writers of this era
 hindi sahitya main sant kaviyon kii tarah bhikshuon ne burmi sahitya par aadhipaty kar liya he
 Among the monk poets, Shin Mahasilvansh, Shin Uttamjou, Shin Tejosar and Shin Maharadarsar etc
 are famous
 yah burmi sahitya ke vistaar or prasar kaa yug he
 Due to the atmosphere of war at this time, campaign songs have been composed in abundance
 navade, vayaabalan or naintayit aadi is yug ke prasiddh kavi hai
 All poets are found in Ketumati only after the victory of Ketumati and the defeat of Ava
 is kaal main pali shaskaon ke aadhaar par mahakavyon evam khandakavyon ke saath hi samvaad kaa bhi nirmaan hua
 All the compositions were related to Buddhism
 yug ke varamisanghnath kaa "manikundal" naamak kathasahitya kathagranthon main sabase acha mana jaataa he
 This story is like Sanskrit and is elaborate and ornate
 samaas kaa hone par bhi prachlit shabdon kaa hi yathasthaan prayog kiye vah saadhaaran vyaktiyon ke liye bhi subodh he
 In this era, in addition to the compositions, the Buddhist scriptures were translated and translated Manusmriti by name
 is yug main 'padesh' naamak rajyamantri kaa sahitya atyant prasiddh he
 In this era, there is a lack of poets, due to which a new style developed in it and in it the importance of rasa was given more than sentiment
 raajaaon kii stuti prachur maatra main naamak nae kaavyon kaa pradurbhaav hua
 There is a lot of nature in it
 is yug main "uu o" kavi hue jo 15 varsh kii avasthaa se hi sahitya kaa karne lage
 Sinhasur, Nandasur and Lave Sundar have extremely high ratu
 usamen prakruti kaa chithran bahut safalataa se kiya

 Has written "ramarkan"
 is samay burmi main paanch ram par paanch prakaar kii ramayana milti he, yatha hindu ram, samatra ram, shyaam ram or burmi ram
 Of these, the Bodhisattva is Rama and Rama is the Ramayana of Sanskrit
 yahan uu to ne apane ramarkan kaa nirmaan shyaam ram ke ramayana ke aadhaar par kiya
 To this day it is used as a famous work in Burmese literature
 is yug main uu ja, uu omas or di ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Plurality of women litterateurs
 is yug kaa sahitya bhi raajaaon he
 Translations from many languages were also done in this era
 punya kaa naam bahut aadar se liya jaataa he
 He created a variety of literature from a mukhi pen
 unke naatak lokapriy hai
 Literature of language, style, sentiment etc
 is considered very high
 isliye unhen 'burmi kalidas' evam 'shakespeare' kaha gaya he
 In this era, English literature started producing new narratives, which is different from fiction
 kavitaaon main bhi krantikari kii gai
 It is natural to change the style of poets as human thoughts change
 is yug main min thuvan ne chhandmukt kavita kaa nirmaan kiya he
 He faced many critics initially but later all of them started following him

 pi-ve kii big adventure, kii vittiya safalataa ke baad, warner bros ne tim bartan ko bitman ke nirdesan ke liye aamantrit kiya
 Burton's then-girlfriend Julie Hickson was feeling a bit of a halt in the former screenplay written by Tom mckeewiss, so he added a new 30-page script to the film
 The success of The Dark Knight Returns and The Killing Joke aroused Warner's Bros
 interest in making a film adaptation again
 Burton was not initially a comic book fan and was heavily influenced by the dark and serious tone found in both The Dark Knight Returns and The Killing Joke
 warner bros ne march 1986 main nae patakatha ke lekhan main steve anglehart se sahaayta praapt kiya tha
 It featured Joker and Rupert Thorne as the main villains, as well as Penguins
 Silver was cast by St
 Cloud and Dick Grayson for the lead supporting role as Cameo Epirions
 isamen anglehart ke apane swayan kii strange eparishans simit shrinkhalaa kii tarah hi isaki katharekha he
 
 Warner Bros
 was heavily influenced, but Englehart felt it had too many characters
 unhone penguin or dick gracen ko duusare patakatha se baahar kar diya or may 1986 main iskaa samaapan kiya
 Burton approached Sam Hamm, a comic book fan, to write the screenplay
 ham ne mul kahani kaa istemaal nahin karne kaa nirnay liya, unka maananaa tha ki flash back adhik upyogi hoga or jo ki "rahasy kaa pardaafash" karegaa or vah kathanak kaa ek hissaa hoga
 unhone tark diya ki, "aap puri tarah se apane shrey ko samaapt kar denge yadi aap brus vene ke bitman banane kii prakriya ko dikhaaenge
" ham ne silver saint cloud ko viki wel ke saath or roopert thorne ko apane swayan kii rachana karl grissom ke saath badali kiya
 He completed his screenplay in October 1986, in which he demoted Dick Grayson to a cameo rather than being a supporting character
 ham kii patakatha ke ek drishy main brus vene ke mata-pita kii hatya hone vaali raat main james gordon ke duty karte dikhaaya gaya he
 The scene was removed when Hamm re-wrote the screenplay
 ham kii patakatha ko jaanane kii prabal ichha thi kyonki bitman ke sah-nirmaataa bob ken ne sakaaratmak pratikriya vyakt kii thi, iske baavjood warner bros film ko aage badhaane ke liye kam icchhuk the
 At that time Hamm's script became illegal in various comic books in the United States
 bartan kii bitaljus ko ascharyajanak safalataa milane ke baad antat bitman ko pre-production ke liye april 1988 main harizandi praapt hui
 jab hasya pustak prashansakon ko maaikel kiton kii mukhya bhoomika ke saath bartan dwaara film nirdesan kaa pataa chalaa to swar or chal rahe bitman ke nirdesan ko lekar vidaad khadaa hua
 Hamm explained that "they've heard Tim Burton's name and are thinking about pv's Big Adventure
" unhone kiton kaa naam suna or unhen kiton kaa hi koi kamedi laga
 aap bitman ke 1960 sanskaran ke bare main soch rahe hai or yah hamaari film se bilkul vipareet tha
 We tried to market it with a typical dark and grim tone, but the fans didn't trust us
 " film production main yuddh nakaaratmak report karne ke liye, bitman ke sah nirmaataa bob ken ko rachanaatmak salaahkaar ke rup main rakhaa gaya
 Mel Gibson, Kevin Costner, Charlie Sheen, Pierce Brosnan, Tom Selik, and Bill Murray were all considered for Batman
 tim bartan par ek spasht ection film star ko filmaane kaa dabaav banaaya gaya tha
 Producer John Peters favored Michael Keaton, stating that Keaton had the right "edgy, tormented character
" " bartan ke nirdesan main kiton ke bitaljus main kaam karne kii vazah se bartan raji hue
 Keaton's casting led to protests among comic book fans and 50,000 letters were sent by fans to the Brothers Warner office
 bob ken, sam haam or maaikel uslaan ko bhi baari maatra main casting ke bare main poochtacha kii gai, jabaki adam west ko khud ko behatar vikalp hona mahasoos hua
 Burton admitted that, "there was obviously a negative reaction among comic book people
 mujhe lagata he unhen lag rahaa he ki ham 1960 ke dashak ke tivi shrinkhalaa kii hi tarah ise banane ja rahe hai kyonki ve mistar mom or nite shift yaa kuch usee prakaar se maaikel kiton ko samaj rahe hai
 "keaton studied the Dark Knight Returns for inspiration
 tim kari, wilem daafo, david bovi or james woods ko joker ke liye vichaar kiya gaya
 Robin Williams lobbied hard for this
 Jack Nicholson was a favorite of producers Michael Uslan and Bob Kane since 1980
 da viches of eastavik ke filmakan ke dauraan hi peters ne 1986 main nickelson se sampark kiya tha
 Nicholson had an agreement known as "off-the-clock"
 unke anubandh main unke ek din kaam karne kii ghante nirdisht tha, kuch samay ke liye ve set chhod kar gaye the or ve unhen waapas filmakan ke liye aana padaa
 niklson ne unke saare drishy kaa filmakan teen saptaah main karne kii maang kii thi lekin yah 106 dinon main samaapt hui
 unhen $6 million kaa vetan mila saath hi unhen box offis ke sakal kaa ek bada pratishat bhi diya gaya
 His total salary is said to be around $ 50 million
 vastav main shaun yang ko viki wel ke liye liya gaya tha lekin filmakan ke dauraan vah ghayal ho gai thi
 Burton suggested replacing Michelle Pfeiffer as Young, Keaton, who was in a relationship with Pfeiffer at the time, believed it would be quite awkward
 He was selected to play Catwoman in Batman Returns
 peters ne kim basinger kaa suzav diya or unhen film ke liye hastakshar kar liya gaya
 a fan of Michael Gough's work in many of Hammer's film productions, Burton filmed as Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred Pennyworth
 robert wool kaa filmakan reporter alexander nokes ke rup main kiya gaya
 Wool said that at the end of the film my character was supposed to die of Joker's poisonous gas but the filmmakers "liked the character enough" that "they decided to keep me alive
" " billy di williams ne harvi dent kii bhoomika kii kyonki ve tu-phase ke agali kadi main bhoomika karnaa chaahate the
 Tommy Lee Jones later took the role of Batman Forever
 williams is casting ke nirnay se halke se niraash hue the
 Nicholson persuaded the filmmakers to cast Tracey Wolter for the role of Bob, the Joker's henchman, both of whom were close friends in real life
 baaki ke charitra jisamen kamishnar gordon ke rup main pat hingal, karl grisom ke rup main jaik palans, alisia hunt ke rup main jeri haul, meyar berg ke rup main lee vaalas or leftnant maiks ikharadt ke rup main williams hutkins shaamil hai
 The filmmakers thought of fully filming Batman on the Warner Bros
 backlot in Burbank, California, but had to relocate due to media interest in the film
 Shooting from October 1988 to January 1989 at Pinewood Studios in England
 18 dhwani manchon kaa upyog kiya gaya or pinwood samgr rup se lagbhag 95-acre main he
 Locations include the doubling of Nebworth House and Hatfield House Wayne Manor, and the Acton Lane Power Station and Little Barford Power Station
 mul utpaadan bajet $30 million se lekar $48 million dollar rahaa
 filmakan behad gopneey tha
 The unit publicist was offered £ 10,000 for Nicholson's first images as a clown, which he refused
 Police were later called when two reels of footage were stolen
 shooting ke dauraan vibhinn samasyaon ke kaaran bartan ne ise "yatnaa kaha
 mere jivan kii sabase bure din"! During the 1988 Writers Guild of America, Hamm was not allowed to perform rewrites
 filmakan ke dauraan jonathan james, warren scarain or charles mckion ne film phir se patakatha likhaa
 ham ne punarlekhnon kii aalochana kii, lekin warner bros par parivartan ko doshi tehraaya
 bartan ne bataaya, "mujhe samaj nahin aata ki kyon vah is tarah kaa ek samasya ban gaya
 We started with a screenplay that was liked by everyone, although we recognized that a little bit of change was needed
 " dick gracen shooting script main dikhaai die lekin use hataa diya gaya tha, kyonki film nirmaataa ko mahasoos hua ki vah kathanak ke liye apraasangik tha
 This decision was supported by Bob Kane
 charmotkarsh main multah, joker ko maarane ke liye viki wel bitman ko ek tamsik rosh main bhejti he
 Without saying Burton, John Peters changes the climax and creates a model of a 38-foot cathedral for commissioned production designer Anton Furst
 $100,000 kii laagat thi jab film kaa bajet pehle hi adhik ho gaya tha
 Burton disliked the idea, had no clue how the scene would end: "jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger were walking into this cathedral and turn Jack halfway and say," Why am i climbing all these stairs? " Am? Where am i going? 'we'll talk about it when you reach the top!' i had to tell that i do not know
 " "I envisaged Gotham the way i see it now at Pinewood
 They've got it, every building, every trash can, every brick
" bartan, da company of volvas main anton furst ke dizin se kaaphi prabhavit the or purv main bitaljus ke liye production diziner ke rup main lene se vifal ho gaye the
 Furst had been committed to High Spirit, an option he later regretted
 furst ko bartan ke saath kaam karne main kaaphi acha laga
 unhone mahasoos kiya, "mujhe nahin lagata ki main kabhi bhi kisi nirdeshak ke saath swaabhaavik rup se dhun main rahaa
" "dharnatmak, aadhyatmik, drishyaatmak yaa kalatmak rup se
 hamalogon ke bich kisi bhi prakaar kii samasya nahin hui kyonki ham logon main kisi bhi baat ko lekar matbhed hi nahin tha
 Is a master in texture, attitude and emotion "
 furst or kala vibhaag ne "gotham shahar ko sabase asundar or ujaad kalpaneey mahanagar banane ke liye" jaanboojh kar mishrit sthapaty style kaa prayog kiya
 Furst further noted that, "we imagined what New York City could be like without a Planning Commission

 "derek Meddings served as a visual effects supervisor while Keith Short helped build the 1989 Batmobile, and added two Browning machine guns to it

 poshaak diziner bob ringwood bitman ke paksh main license tu kil par kaary karne kaa mauka thukraa diya
 ringwood ne bat ke kapadon ke digining main kaaphi dikkaton ko paaya kyonki "comics main bitman kii chhavi kaaphi badi he or gaal main dimpal ke saath vah chhaarfoot chaar inch kaa vyakti he
 He said that Michael Keaton is a mediocre person
 " "samasya yah thi ki kisi ausat vyakti or aam aadmi ko bhagwaan dwaara banaae gaye aadmi se bhi bada aadmi bananaa tha
 "burton commented," Michael has a slight reticence that makes it bad 
 isliye poshaak use dark banaati he haalanki bitman kii tarah bhav-dasha bhi dikhti he, isliye ve iskaa acchhee tarah se istemaal kar sakate hai
 "burton had the idea of using completely black clothing and Bob Kane responded positively

 Ringwood studied nearly 200 comic book editions for inspiration
 28 letex murti dizin banaaya gaya tha; 25 prakaar ke kep swaroop or 6 prakaar ke vibhinn siron ko banaaya gaya or in sabaki kul laagat $250,000 thi
 Comic book fans initially reacted negatively against the Batsuit
 Burton did not use tights, spandex, or underpants, as he felt that they were not all that scary

 The language of Kerala is Malayalam which is one of the languages of the Dravidian family
 malayalam bhashaa ke udgam ke bare main anek siddhanth prastut kiye gaye hai
 One view is that Malayalam developed as an independent language due to geographical reasons from an accustomed Dravidian language
 iske vipareet doosraa mat yah he ki malayalam tamil se vyutpann bhashaa he
 These two are strong opinions
 sabhi vidwaan yah maanate hai ki bhashaai parivarttan kii vajah se malayalam udbhoot hui
 Malayalam has a deep connection with both Tamil and Sanskrit languages
 malayalam kaa sahitya maukhik rup main shatabdiyaan purana he
 But it developed as a literary language from the 13th century
 is kaal main likhit 'ramcharitam' ko malayalam kaa aadi kavy mana jaataa he
 Initially Malayalam prose works were written on copper sheets, stones, palm leaves
 inamen gadhy bhashaa main vyaktiyon tathaa mandiron kii sampatti tathaa dhan daan sambandhi aadi pramukh vishay he or prashasan sambandhi nirdesh hai
 The copper-rock articles obtained of this type belong to the 9th century
 aaj ke gadyon se un lekhon ke gadhy ke dur kaa sambandh bhi nahin he
 The oldest prose book that has been received is the cauldron
 chanakya ke arthshaastra kii malayalam main vyakhya hi bhashaa kautilium naam se vikhyath he
 Its composition period is either the late 11th century or the first half of the 12th century
 nauveen sadi se malayalam jis lipi main likhi jaati thi us lipi ko 'vattatouttu' naam se pukaara jaataa tha
 Later, the script 'koleshuttu' emerged from this script
 tadnantar jo granthlipi bani usase aaj kii malayalam lipi viksit hui
 From the 16th century onwards, the script was promoted
 tunchattejuttachhan malayalam ke janak maane jate hai, unhone apana 'kishippattukal' granthaksharon main likhaa tha
 There are accentual and stylistic distinctions in various dialects of Malayalam
 yadhyapi mudran 16 veen shatabdi main hi kerala pahaunchi phir bhi malayalam kaa mudran kala kaary der se hi hua
 The first printed text of Malayalam is 'sarvadevedartham' which was printed in Roma in 1772
 malayalam kerala or lakshadweep kii pramukh bhashaa he
 Malayalam, one of the Dravidian languages, has many theories about its origin
 sarvaadhik sweekrut siddhanth yah he ki isvi san 9 veen shatabdi main kerala main prachlit tamil se malayalam swatantra bhashaa ke rup main viksit hui
 It is a language spoken by more than thirty million people and its speakers live outside of Saudi Arabia and also in Gulf countries outside Kerala
 saahitiyik bhashaa ke rup main malayalam kaa vikaas 13 veen sadi se hone laga
 From the 9th century, the 'vatteshuttu script' was used for writing Malayalam
 kintu 16 veen shatee main prayukt 'granthlipi' se aadhunik malayalam lipi viksit hui
 Various opinions are found about the Malayalam alphabet
 'kerala paninium' ke rachayita e
 aar
 rajrajverma kaa mat he ki malayalam main arthbhed utpann karne vaale 53 sabase chote varna yaa swanim hai
 These characters are considered to be alphabets
 malayalam kaa sarvaadhik pramanik vyakaran granth hone kaa gaurav 'kerala paninium' ko praapt he
 Other grammars that compose Malayalam grammar are Herrmann Gundert, George Matan, Kovunni Nedungadi, Seshagiri Prabhu etc
 malayalam ke vikaas evam poshan sanvardhan main samrudh sahitya, patr - patrikas tathaa pustak - prakaashan kii vyapak vyavastha aadi mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaate hai
 The role of Kerala's education systems and cultural establishments was also no less important
 yah bataanaa kathin he ki malayalam main kitne varna yaa akshar hai
 This requires recourse to modern linguistics, which has formed the basis of letters, letters or phonemes
 jis dhwani kaa swatantra uccharan hota he use 'akshar' athwa 'silabal' kehete hai
 The smallest linguistic unit that can produce meanings is called 'varna' or 'phoneme'
 "aaj kal akshar kaa prayog 'silabal' arth main kiya jaataa he jo paribhaashik shabd he
 When someone asks how many letters are there in Malayalam, the questioner refers to knowing the number of characters as in English
 yadi thik-thik kaha jaay to angrezi main varnon kii sankhya 26 he or lipiyon kii sankhya bhi 26 he
 There is no connection between characters and scripts in Malayalam
 sambandh aksharon va lipiyon ke bich he
 The huge letter numbers of Malayalam made script improvement difficult and complex
 malayalam kii varna sankhya isliye nahin bataai ja sakati, kyon ki unamem dhwanim str par bhed hai, jinako nakaara nahin ja saktaa he
 Various grammar texts prove this point "
 herman gundert ke anusaar malayalam main 49 varna hai, jorge mattan kii drushti main yah 48 he, e
 aar
 rajraj verma or sheshgiri prabhu ke anusaar 53 varna hai
 a
 R
 The alphabetical order given by Rajarajavarma in Kerala Paniniyam is the following - hrasv swar a i u ri e o deergh swar aa i uu ri o i ou Alppran aspirate voiceless d Osh nasal touch madhyam These scripts are available in Malayalam but are not words made from these scripts
 inhen varnmaala main sthaan bhi nahin he
 The general arrangement of Malayalam script garlands is that of a letter a script
 is kaaran kaha ja saktaa he ki malayalam main varnmaala na hokar aksharmala hi praapt hoti he
 But Chilchar is an example of this
 mudran main jaisi malayalam lipiyaan aajkal prayukt hoti hai, ve samay-samay par hue parishkar or sudhaar kaa parinaam he
 Although the main language of Kerala is Malayalam, many languages are used here
 kerala main angrezi ko pramukh sthaan praapt he
 Like Malayalam, English is the main medium of education
 tamil or kannada bhashaaon ko alpsankhyak bhashaa-pad diya gaya he
 Kerala has different language-societies
 kerala main rahane vaale vibhinn bhashaa samaajon main nimnlikhit bhashaayen maatrubhaasha ke rup main boli jaati he - adivasee bhashaayen, tamil, kannada, telegu, tulu, konkani, gujarati, marathi, urdu, punjabi aadi
