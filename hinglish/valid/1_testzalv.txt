 Satyavati is an important character in the Mahabharata
 uskaa vivaah hastinapurnaresh shantanu se hua
 His original name was 'matsyagandha'
 vah brahma ke shaap se matsaybhav ko praapt hui "adrika" naam kii apsara ke garbh se uparichar vasu dwaara utpann ek kanya thi
 Its name was later called Satyavati
 machhlee kaa pet fadkar mallahon ne ek balak or ek kanya ko nikaala or raja ko soochna di
 The king accepted the son as a son, but due to the smell of fish from the body of the girl, the king gave it to the sailor
 pita kii seva ke liye vah yamuna main naav chalaaya karti thi
 Parashar Muni was presumed dead by Sahastrajun and was left dead
 mata satyavati ne muniraaj kii seva kii va jivan daan diya
 Maharishi was pleased and destroyed her fishy and gave a boon to get the best smell from her body, so she became famous by the name 'gandhavati'
 uskaa naam 'yojangandha' bhi tha
 Maharishi Ved Vyas was born from him
 baad main raja shantnu se uskaa vivaah hua
 In ancient times there was a king named Sudhanwa
 ve ek din akhet ke liye van gayi
 It was only after he left that his wife became menstruated
 usne is samachar ko apni shikari pakshi ke madhyam se raja ke paas bhijwaya
 After receiving the news, Maharaj Sudhanwa took out his semen in one and gave it to the bird
 pakshi us done ko raja kii patni ke paas pahunchaane akaash main ud chalaa
 On the way, that predatory bird found another predatory bird
 donon pakshiyon main yuddh hone laga
 During the war, he got rid of both bird's claws and fell into Yamuna
 yamuna main brahma ke shaap se machhlee bani ek apsara rahati thi
 The nymph of fish swallowed semen flowing in both and due to its effect she became pregnant
 garbh purna hone par ek nishad ne us machhlee ko apane jaal main fasaa liya
 When Nishad cut the fish, a boy and a girl came out of his stomach
 nishad un shishuon ko lekar maharaj sudhanva ke paas gaya
 Due to not being the son of Maharaj Sudhanwa, he kept the child with him, named Matsyaraj
 balika nishad ke paas hi rah gai or uskaa naam matsaygandha rakhaa gaya kyonki uske angon se machhlee kii gandh nikalati thi
 That girl is also known as Satyavati
 badi hone par vah naav khene kaa kaary karne lagi
 Once Parashar Muni had to sit on his boat and cross the Yamuna
 parashar muni satyavati rup-soundarya par aasakt ho gayi or bole, "devi! main tumhaare saath sahavaas karnaa chahta hoon
 "satyavati said," Muniver! You are a theologian and i am a Nishad girl
 hamaara sahavaas sambhav nahin he
 i am a virgin mere pita kya kahenge" parashar muni bole, "balike! tum chintaa mat karo
 You will remain a virgin even after childbearing
 " parashar ne phir se maang kii to satyavati boli kii" mere sharir se machhlee kii durgandh nikalati he"
 Then while blessing him, he said, "the smell of fish coming out of your body will turn into fragrance
 " Having said this, he created a thick mist network around his yoga force so that no one else would see him in that condition
 is prakaar parashar va satyavati main pranay sambandh sthapit hua
 When the time came, Satyavati had a son from Vedas, who passed from the womb
 janm hote hi vah balak bada ho gaya or apni mata se bolaa, "mata! tu jab kabhi bhi vipatti main mujhe samaran karegi, main upasthit ho jaaungaa
 "having said this, he went to the island of Dwaipayan to do penance
 dwaipayan dweep main tapasya karne tathaa unke sharir kaa rang kaala hone ke kaaran unhe krishna dwaipayan kaha jane laga
 Later on he became famous by the name of Ved Vyas because of commenting on the Vedas
 ek baar hastinapur ke maharaj prateep ganga ke kinare tapasya kar rahe the
 Fascinated by his beauty, Goddess Ganga sat on his right thigh
 maharaj yah dekh kar aashcharya main pad gayi tab ganga ne kaha, "he rajan! main jahnu rishi kii putree ganga hoon* or aapse vivaah karne kii abhilaashaa le kar aapke paas ai hoon
 "on this Maharaja Pratip said," Gange! You are sitting on my right thigh
 patni ko to vamangi hona chaiye, dahini jaangh to putr kaa pratik he atah main tumhen apane putravadhu ke rup main sweekaar karata hoon
 "ganga went away after hearing this
 ab maharaj prateep ne putr prapti ke liye ghor tap karnaa armbh kar diya
 As a result of his tenacity, he received a son, whom he named Shantanu
 shantanu ke yuva hone par use ganga ke saath vivaah karne kaa aadesh de maharaj prateep swarg chale gayi
 To follow his father's order, Shantanu went to Ganga and requested him to marry her
 ganga boleen, "rajan! main aapke saath vivaah to kar sakati hoon kintu aapako vachan dena hoga ki aap mere kisi bhi kaary main hastkshep nahin karenge
 "shantanu got married as promised by Ganga and married him
 ganga ke garbh se maharaj shantanu ke aath putr huye jinamein se saat ko ganga ne ganga nadi main le ja kar baha diya or apane diye huye vachan main bandhe hone ke kaaran maharaj shantanu kuch bol na sake
 When Ganga had an eighth son and she also took him to the river for shed, the king did not stop with Shantanu and he said, "ganges! You shed my seven sons in the river but according to your promise i did not say anything 
 ab tum mere is aathven putr ko bhi bahaane ja rahi ho
 i pray you, please do not throw it in the river
 " yah sun kar ganga ne kaha, "rajan! aapane apni pratigya bhang kar di he isaliye ab main aapke paas nahin rah sakati
 "by saying this, Ganga became attuned to her son
 tatpashchaat maharaj shantanu ne chhattis varsh brahmacharya vrath dhaaran kar ke vyateet kar diye
 Then one day he went to the Ganges and said to Ganga, "ganges! Today i want to see the child whom you took with you
 " ganga ek sundar stri ke rup main us balak ke saath prakat ho gayi or boleen, "rajan! yah aapkaa putr he tathaa iskaa naam devvrat he, ise grahan karo
 Along with being mighty, he will also be a scholar
 astr vidya main yah parashuram ke samaan hoga
 "maharaj Shantanu was overjoyed to find his son Devavrata and brought him with him to Hastinapur and declared him crown prince
 ek din maharaj shantanu yamuna ke tat par gum rahe the ki unhen nadi main naav chalaate huye ek sundar kanya drushtigat hui
 Smell was coming out of his body
 maharaj ne us kanya se poocha, "he devi! tum koun ho?" kanya ne bataaya, "maharaj! meraa naam satyavati he or main nishad kanya hoon
 "maharaj, rearing her youth at her appearance, immediately reached her father and proposed his marriage to Satyavati
 is par dheenvar bolaa, "rajan! mujhe apni kanya kaa aapke saath vivaah karne main koi aapatti nahin he parantu aapako meri kanya ke garbh se utpann putr ko hi apane rajya kaa uttaradhikari bananaa hoga
 
 " nishad ke in vachanon ko sun kar maharaj shantanu chupchaap hastinapur laut aaye
 King Shantanu became distraught due to his separation with Satyavati
 unka sharir durbal hone laga
 Seeing this condition of Maharaj, Devavrata got very worried
 jab unhen mantriyon ke dwaara pita kii is prakaar kii dasha hone kaa kaaran gyaat hua to ve tatkaal samast mantriyon ke saath nishad ke ghar ja pahunche or unhone nishad se kaha, "he nishad! aap saharsha apni putree satyavati kaa vivaah mere pita shantanu ke saath kar den
 i promise you that the child born from your daughter's womb will be the heir to the kingdom
 kaalaantar main meri koi santaan aapaki putree ke santaan kaa adhikaar chin na paye is kaaran se main pratigya karata hoon ki main aajanm avivaahit rahoonga
 "hearing this promise, Nishad folded his hands and said," o Devvrat! Your pledge is unprecedented
 " itnaa kah kar nishad ne tatkaal apni putree satyavati ko devvrat tathaa unke mantriyon ke saath hastinapur bhej diya
 Devavrata brought his mother Satyavati and handed it over to her father Shantanu
 pita ne prasann hokar putr se kaha, "vatsa! tuune pitrubhakti ke vasheebhoot hokar aisi pratigya kii he jaisi ki na aaj tak kisi ne kiya he or na bhavishya main karegaa
 i give you a boon that you will die by your will
 teri is prakaar kii pratigya karne ke kaaran tu bhishma kahalaayegaa or teri pratigya bhishma pratigya ke naam se sadaiv prakhyat rahegi
 " satyavati ke chitrangad or vichitraveery naamak do putr huye
 Shantanu died in the childhood of Chitrangad and Vichitravirya, so Bhishma was nurtured
 bhishma ne chitrangad ke bade hone par unhen rajgaddi par bitha diya lekin kuch hi kaal main gandharvon se yuddh karte huye chitrangad maaraa gaya
 At this Bhishma handed over the kingdom to his Anuj Vichitravirya
 ab bhishma ko vichitraveery ke vivaah kii chintaa hui
 At the same time, the three girls of Kashiraj, Amba, Ambika and Ambalaika were about to be swayamvara
 unke swayamvar main jaakar akele hi bhishma ne vahaan aaye samast raajaaon ko parrast kar diya or teenon kanyaon kaa haran kar ke hastinapur le aaye
 The elder girl Amba told Bhishma that she had given her body and mind to Raj Shalva
 uski baat sun kar bhishma ne use raja shalve ke paas bhijwa diya or ambika or ambalika kaa vivaah vichitraveery ke saath karvaa diya
 King Shalva did not accept Amba, so she returned to Hastinapur and said to Bhishma, "O Arya! You have brought me everything, so you marry me
" " kintu bhishma ne apni pratigya ke kaaran uske anurodh ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Amba was angry and went to Parashurama and told him about his agony and asked for help
 parashuram ne amba se kaha, "he devi! aap chintaa na karen, main aapkaa vivaah bhishma ke saath karwaaungaa
 "parashurama sent a call to Bhishma but Bhishma did not go to him
 is par krodhit hokar parashuram bhishma ke paas pahunche or donon veeron main bhayanak yuddh chhid gaya
 Both were unprecedented warriors, so the victory and victory could not be decided
 aakhir devataaon ne hastkshep kar ke is yuddh ko band karvaa diya
 Disappointed, Amba went to do penance in the forest
 vichitraveery apni donon raniyon ke saath bhoga vilaas main rat ho gayi kintu donon hi raniyon se unki koi santaan nahin hui or ve kshay rog se peedit ho kar mrityu ko praapt ho gayi
 Now fearing total destruction, Mother Satyavati said to Bhishma one day, "son! To save this dynasty from being destroyed, my command is that you produce a son from these two queens
" " mata kii baat sun kar bhishma ne kaha, "mata! main apni pratigya kisi bhi sthiti main bhang nahin kar saktaa
 " yah sun kar mata satyavati ko atyant dukh hua
 Suddenly he remembered his son Ved Vyas
 samaran karte hi vedavyas vahaan upasthit ho gayi
 Satyavati looked at them and said, "O son, all your brothers have gone childless
 atah mere vansh ko naash hone se bachaane ke liye main tumhen ajna detii hoon ki tum unki patniyon se santaan utpann karo
 "ved Vyas obeyed and said," Mother! You should tell both those queens that they will follow the fast for one year only then they will conceive
 " ek varsh vyateet ho jane par vedavyas sabase pehle badi rani ambika ke paas gayi
 Ambika closed her eyes due to fear of his glory
 vedavyas laut kar mata se bole, "mata ambika kaa bada tejasvi putr hoga kintu netra band karne ke dosha ke kaaran vah andhaa hoga
 "satyavati was deeply saddened to hear this and sent Vedvyas to the younger queen Ambalika
 ambalika vedavyas ko dekh kar bhay se pili pad gai
 On returning from her chamber, Ved Vyas said to Satyavati, "mother! Ambalika will have a son suffering from Pandu disease from her womb
 " isse mata satyavati ko or bhi dukh hua or unhone badi rani ambalika ko punah vedavyas ke paas jane kaa aadesh diya
 This time the elder queen did not go herself and sent her handmaid to Ved Vyas
 is baar vedavyas ne mata satyavati ke paas aa kar kaha, "maate! is daasi ke garbh se veda-veydant main paarangat atyant nitivaan putr utpann hoga
 "saying this, Ved Vyas went to penance
 samay aane par ambika ke garbh se janmaandh dhritarashtra, ambalika ke garbh se pandu rog se grasit pandu tathaa daasi ke garbh se dharmatma vidura kaa janm hua

 darasal, aise kisi kar kaa bhugtan karnaa he hi nahin
 However, the need to pay fees or taxes is only used as an excuse to dispose of any free money and / or to extort money from the victim
 antat vibhinn sadhano or upkarnon dwaara shikaar ko manaa liya jayega ki trunk main bahut badi raashi nakadi he jo vaid he, yaa phir vaid nahin ho to bhi puri raashi kaa nakadi hona hi bahut bade kaaran main shumaar hota he

 iske liye ek vaid kaaran diya jayega: "mritak africa main kalakritiyon kaa kaarobaar karata tha or marane se pehle kuch mahange item ke liye use nakadi main bhugtan karnaa tha
 The paper currency had to be blackened to avoid customs and theft problems
 The victim is convinced that the chemical money needed to wash the paper currency is also in the box
 peedit vyakti pehle se hi shulk or karon ke bhugtan ke liye kuch paise bhar chukaa he or ab use sandook ko uske ghar tak pahunchane ke liye shipping kharch ke bhugtan ke liye bulaayaa ja saktaa he
 Whether the payment has been made or not, the box will not be sent any further and amounts will be demanded in the form of various excuses, such as taxes, security company fees, money transfer fees, legalization fees, export permits, etc
 the list is endless

 shikaar vyakti ko suchit kiya jayega ki in bankenoton ko lagbhag ek adhulaneey rasayan se kaala kar diya gaya he, lekin ek aisa rasayan maujuud he jo bank note ko saaf kar saktaa he
 The Makkar man will then ask the random person to select any black bank note while presenting the victim to a small vial of washing liquid
 Once this is done, he goes on to wash the banknote with the Makkar chemical fluid, substituting the original note that has been washed away, presenting a game of sleight of hand
 ab or adhik noton ko dhone ke liye aparyaapt taral drav bachaa rahegaa, karne ke liye dhan, yaa ho saktaa he vah makkaar "galati" se bottle ko farsh par gira degaa
 The victim cannot carry the box, or any note, because he has been informed that taxes have not been paid, but once the notes are washed away, it is easier to pay taxes
 Will go and still millions will be left
 The victim is persuaded to buy a chemical to wash the notes, and of course the cleaning fluid is "very expensive"
 shikaar ek baar phir jaalsaaj ko paise detaa he
 Sometimes a fraudster will create a website as a cleaning fluid vendor, which will clearly have an unusual and unusual name that cannot be found anywhere

 The fraudster will continue to search for excuses as to why the victim may not get his money yet, but will always promise it after a "final and absolutely final" step, which apparently involves paying yet another fee to the victim
 Will happen

 It is unnecessary to say that by the time the police are involved, the fraudster himself and the victim's money have usually disappeared
 is tarah kii adhikansh dhokhadhadi kai kaarnon se peediton dwaara suchit nahin kii jaati he
 At first they feel very ashamed that they can be so naive as to cheat someone
 Secondly, in many scams of obtaining money, the victim will receive the proceeds - intentionally agreeing to involve himself in the crime of theft, for example he may have only been informed that it was money for sale of the substance , Is tax evasion money or simply stolen money
 kabhi kabhi ghotalaabaj shikaar ko khud ko doshi tehraane ko raji kar legaa, arthath ek dastauez ko galat qaraar kar, yaa ek kar ghoshnaa ko jhut kahkar aadi
 Thus the victim may be reluctant to come forward knowing that he had deliberately participated in a criminal scheme of rigging

 Subsequently, the Sumerian state gave consent to the multi-standard Plethora to some standards
 sabhi likhit maan, ek parishuddh ikai maanak ke khandon main main hai
 The Greek root of stadios means to stand or have standing, to establish a standard
 In Mesopotamia the problem was that there were several different standards so in the time of Gudea an agreement was circulated between the various city states much like that which is presently being negotiated in Europe
 The weights and measures of Mesopotamia gradually developed with the associated city states
 The Sumerian number system uses a base 60 positional notation, and is the origin for the division of 60 for hours and angular degrees
 The Akkadian system adopts the Sumerian
 Over a period of several millennia international trade and commerce spread the idea of standards of measure based on definitions of land and property throughout the ancient near east
 International trade required the expansion of the arrangement throughout the ancient Near East as a common standard much like our metric system
 The basis of the standard was a definition of a geographic degree divided into 600 parts know as stadia which were further divided into 600 feet

 Because many members of the film had already read the plot, many actors were willing to play different roles

 Other forms of treatment that have been effective include psychiatric education, anticoagulants, regressive hypnotherapy and re-training for breathing
 sanvrutibhiti ke ilaaj main madad ke liye aksar jin dawaaon ko nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he usamen anti-deprecents or beta-blowers shaamil hai jo ki bhay hamalon ke saath dil prahaar lakshanon main raahat dene main madad karti he
 Because they can produce both fear of suffocation and ligament, MRI scans often prove difficult for patients with closterophobia
 vastav main, anumaan ke anusaar lagbhag 4-20% rogi isi kaaran se scan karne ke liye manaa karte hai
 One study estimated that this percentage could be as high as 37% among all MRI recipients
 emarai scan kaa ausat samay 50 minute hota he; gambhir closterophobia ke marijon main charam bhay or chintaa utpann karne ke liye yah samay paryaapt hota he
 1: This study was conducted with three goals
 emarai ke dauraan bhay kii had ko khojna
 2
 ek emarai ke dauraan bhay ke liye sanketon ko dhoondhna
 3
 emarai ke dauraan manovaigyanik karkon kaa nirikshan karnaa
 is adhyayan ke liye yadrichhik dhang se assi marijon ko chunaa gaya or sanvrutibhiti ke peediton ke bhay ke str kaa naidanik pareekshan kiya gaya; sanvrutibhiti ke saath in marijon kaa isse pehle kabhi upachaar nahin kiya gaya tha
 Also, after MRI, he was tested in a similar way to find out if his fear level had increased
 is prayog kaa nishkarsh yah he ki rogiyon dwaara anubhav kiya gaya bhay kaa praathmik ghatak kaaphi had tak sanvrutibhiti se sambandhit he
 This claim emerged from the high acculturation questionnaire results of those in whom fear was detected during the scan
 scan ke dauraan lagbhag 25% rogiyon main ausat bhay ke anubhav kii soochna di gai or 3 rogi scan ko puraa karne main asamarth rahe
 scan ke ek maheene baad jab unase sampark kiya gaya to 30% rogiyon ne bataaya ki scan ke baad unka sanvrutibhiti ehsaas or bad gaya he
 Most of the patients claimed that they did not realize thrombosis until that point
 is adhyayan kaa nishkarsh he ki sanvrutibhiti prashnawali kaa istemaal emarai ke liye anumati dene se pehle hona chahie
 In the present case with two patients, it was ascertained whether virtual reality distraction can reduce conjunctival symptoms during a simulated magnetic resonance imaging
 Two patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for specific phobia, condition type, reported high levels of phobias during a mock 10-minute MRI procedure, with the exception of VR and being asked to stop the scan beforehand has gone
 unke duusare scan prayaas ke liye marijon ko betaratib dhang se viaar yaa sangeet vikarshan praapt karne ke liye saunpa gaya
 When a deceptive three-dimensional virtual world called Snowworld in which the first patient was able to complete a 10-minute mock scan with little fear and later reported an increase in his self-efficacy
 duusare rogi ne apane duusare scan main keval sangeet vikarshan grahan kiya lekin phir bhi 10 minute ke scan ko puraa karne main sakasham nahin tha or scan ke puraa hone se pehle hi use band karne ke liye kaha

 Many researchers used a variety of fears, using several researchers from VR from the Dermft University's mediometric department, including the Faculty of Psychology of the University of Amsterdam, and conducted several research projects on VRET
 pariyojna main istemaal kiye gaye viaar pranali ko tiu delft main viksit kiya gaya he
 Several ves were developed for a variety of fear risks
 uttungta bheeti ke upachaar ke liye abhaasi prajvalit seedhi or chat kaa chazza, do vii hai
 There are also ves that are considered essential for the treatment of hyperactivity such as virtual hallways, virtual closets and elevators
 Virtual flight and virtual airport have been developed for the treatment of patients with fear of flying
 saamaajik bhay or janaatank jokhim ke liye chikitsa ko viksit karnaa vii kaa mukhya uddeshy he haalanki tiu delft ke mediamatics vibhaag ne abhi tak ise viksit nahin kiya he
 Virtual reality allows a third option of treatment to be unveiled in a virtual setting that is safer, less embarrassing, and less expensive than reproducing real-world situations
 iske alaava aisi sthitiyon ko banaaya ja saktaa he jinhen vaastavik jivan main khojna mushkil ho saktaa he or yah khatre kii kalpana karne kii tulana main adhik vaastavik hota he
 However some experiments have proved VR as a useful tool in the treatment of certain phobias including fear of altitude, fear of spiders, fear of flying and fear of growth, as well as fear of crowds
 haalanki adhikansh anusandhan, jo viaar expozar par kiye jate hai vah ekal maamla adhyayan se nirmit hota he or nishkarsh ke samarthan ke liye niyantrit samooh adhyayan aavashyak hote hai
 Research in this area is still in its infancy, but is making rapid progress

 Many experts who have studied vascularity claim that it contains two separable components; Fear of suffocation and restriction
 In an attempt to substantiate this claim, a study was conducted by three experts to clearly prove the difference
 78 rogiyon ko prashnawali dene ke madhyam se adhyayan ko yojit kiya gaya jinhone emarai pareekshan karavaaya tha
 The data were compiled into a fear scale with separate subparameters for suffocation and confinement
 siddhanthata, ye upskel alag ho sakate hai agar yogadan kaarak vastav main alag honge
 adhyayan yah sabit karne main safal hua ki lakshan alag-alag hai
 Therefore, according to this study, it is necessary to understand both of these root causes in order to effectively combat vascularity
 chunki yah adhyayan keval un logon par lagu hota he jinhone apni emarai ko puraa kiya, jo emarai puraa karne main asamarth the ve is adhyayan main shaamil nahin the
 It is likely that many people were excluded from it due to severe case of hyperactivity
 isliye, un logo kaa abhaav jo gambhir sanvrutibhiti se peedit the, ve in aankadon ko visham kar sakate the
 Some students at the University of Texas at Austin were given initial diagnosis and scored between 1 and 5 depending on their likelihood of growth
 jinhone 3 yaa ucchtar ank hasil kiya unhen adhyayan main prayog kiya gaya
 The students were then asked how much better they felt if they were forced to live in a small room for an extended period
 In order to differentiate between the two main causes of variability, questions were asked, separating the reasons related to suffocation and circumcision
 is adhyayan ke nattejey yah bataate hai adhikansh chaatro main ghutan ke bhay se kahin adhik parirodh kaa bhay tha
 Due to this difference of fear, it can still be said clearly that there exists a clear difference between these two reasons
 is adhyayan ko 98 logon par lagu kiya gaya, jisamen 49 kaa sanvrutibhiti nidaan kiya gaya or 49 "samudaay niyantran" kiya gaya taaki yah pataa lagaaya ja sake ki yadi sanvrutibhiti dimag, adheeratha-uddipan dwaara vikrut hota he, is had tak ki ve un ghatnaon ke ghatit hone kii sambhaavna par vishwaas karte hai
 Each person was given three events; a phenomenon of phenomena, a generally negative case and a generally positive case - and they were asked how likely it was that this event could happen to them
 jaisi ummid thi, sanvrutibhiti ke sambhavit rogiyon ne niyantran samooh kii tulana main us sanvrutibhiti vaali ghatana ke hone ke bare main kaaphi adhik sambhaavna vyakti kii
 sakaaratmak yaa nakaaratmak ghatnaon main koi ullekhneey antar nahin tha
 However, this study was probably flawed because patients with thrombosis had already been diagnosed
 vikaar kaa nidaan sambhavit rup se vyakti ke is vishwaas ko purvaagrahagrast kar sakati he ki sanvrutibhiti ghatana ke unke saath hone kii sambhaavna ho sakati he
