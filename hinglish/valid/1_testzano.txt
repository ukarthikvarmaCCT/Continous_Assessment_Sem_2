 Mars has two relatively small natural moons, Phobos and Dimose, whose orbit is closer to the planet
 kshudragrah par kabja ek zyada samarthit siddhant he lekin isaki utpatti anishchit bani hui he
 Both satellites were discovered by Asaf Hall in 1877 and were named after the characters Phobos and Dimos, who, in battle in Greek mythology, accompanied their father, the god of war, Eris
 aries rome ke logon ke liye mangal grah ke rup main janaa jaataa tha
 From the surface of Mars, the movements of Phobos and Demos appear to be quite different from our own moon
 phobose pashchim main udai hota he, purv main ast hota he or maatr 11 ghante baad phir se udit hota he
 There is a slightly outward synchronous orbit of the dimose, that is, its orbital period corresponds to its rotation period, as it rises in the east but very slowly

 Since Phobos' orbit is below synchronous altitude, tidal forces from Mars are gradually shortening its orbit
 lagbhag 5 karod varsh main yah yaa to mangal kii sataha main durghatnagrast ho jayega yaa grah ke chaaron ore challe ke rup main tuutakar bikhar jayega
 The origins of both moons are not well understood, due to the low albedo and carbonized condrite structure that is thought to be similar to an asteroid, which supports the theory of grabbing
 phobose kii asthir kaksha ek apekshaakrit haal hi main hathiyaane kii pravriti kii ore ingit prathit hoti he
 But the orbits of both are circular, very close to the equator, which is very unusual for forcibly stripped bodies and also complicates the necessary acquisition dynamics

 kintu bridow ambedkar ke vichaaron ke saath sahamat hue
 Strongly opposed to giving separate electorates on the basis of religion and caste, Gandhi feared that separate electorates given to the untouchables would divide Hindu society
 gandhi ko lagata tha kii, savarnon ko chuaachhut bhuulaane ke liye unke hrydayparivarartan ke kuch avadhi di jaani chahie, kintu yah tark galat siddh hua jab savarnon hindooon dwaara puna sandhi ke kai dashakon baad bhi chuaachhut kaa niyamit paalan hota rahaa

 Under this agreement, the Dalit class was given the right to two votes in a separate electorate, considering the demand for political representation raised by Ambedkar
 iske antargat ek vot se dalit apana pratinidhi chun sakate the va duusari vot se saamaanya varg kaa pratinidhi chunane kii aazaadee thi
 Thus the Dalit representative was to be elected only by the vote of the Dalits
 is praavdhaan se ab dalit pratinidhi ko chunane main saamaanya varg kaa koi dakhal shesh nahin rahaa tha
 But at the same time, the Dalit class could play its role by using its second vote, choosing the representative of the general class

 Whereas, there was no objection from Gandhi about this right given to Indian Christians, Muslims and Sikhs
 " unhone yah bhi kaha ki gandhi koi amar vyakti nahin hai
 How many such people were born in India and went away
 ambedkar ne kaha ki gandhi kii jaan bachaane ke liye vah daliton ke hiton kaa tyaag nahin kar sakate
 Now Gandhi's health was continuously deteriorating due to the death fast
 gandhi ke praanon par baari sankat aan padaa

 Ambedkar was indifferent to the deal, calling it Gandhi's fast to play a drama played by Gandhi to deprive the untouchables of their political rights and pressurize them to withdraw from their demands

 Sludge containing sesame requires some oxidizing material, such as potassium nitrate or nitre
 kaach ke dravit hone par usamen gas ke bahudhaa asankhya chote-chote bulbule, jinako 'beej' kehete hai, fas jate hai
 Some chemical substances are used to release the kach from them
 ye padaarth drav kaach main gas ho jate hai or bijon ko apane saath kaach ke baahar nikaal laate hai
 These substances are called 'purifying materials'
 saadhaarant: shodhak dravya ke liye carbon ammonium lavan yaa arsenic prayukt hota he
 Potatoes, beetroot and wet wood pieces are also poured into liquid liquor to purify the flour
 kaach kaa upyog aisi kai prakaar kii vasatuon main kiya jaataa he jinamein vibhinn bhautik gunon kii aavashyaktaa rahati he
 Variations in the physical properties of the kach can be brought about by different oxides
 bhautik gun kaach main upasthit prayek oxide kii aapekshik maatra par bhi nirbhar karata he
 Density- In kach, the highest density comes from sis oxide and the lowest by boric oxide
 vaidyut gun- kaach kii vidyucchalakata uski rachana, taap evam vaataavaran par nirbhar hoti he
 Nowadays, kach is also being used for dielectric
 tapiya gun- tapt karne par kaach prasaarit hota he, par boric oxide evam magnesium oxide ke kaach main nunatam prasar hota he or kshareey oxide se adhiktam prasar
 Heat conductivity - Kach is the least conductor of heat; Silica and boric oxide have lower heat conductivity in the sludge
 kaach ke anya bhautik gun, jaise yang kaa pratyasthata-gunank, tanaav shakti, dridhtaa tathaa tapiya sahansheeltaa, kaach main pade oxidon par nirbhar hote hai
 By studying the effect of these in the sludge, the chemical sludge, the heat-resistant slurry, which can be heated red and cooled completely in ice, and the thermometer sludge are produced

 botalon kii pushtataa kii pariksha ke liye botalon ke bheetar jal bharkar jal kii daab dhire-dhire badhaai jaati he ki bottlen fat jaaen
 Thermal tolerance - The amount of sudden heat change that a vessel can bear without breaking it is called thermal tolerance of the coil
 is gun ke pareekshan ke liye kaach kii vastuon ko jal main vibhinn tapon tak garam kar barf se thande kiye gaye jal main achaanak dubo dete hai
 Pasteurization, cooking utensils, lamp chimneys, chemical slabs and thermometer hose, require high thermal tolerant grips
 kaach main adhik tapiya sahansheeltaa utpann karne ke liye silica kii maatra adhik or kshar kii maatra kam honi chahie tathaa kaach main kuch maatra main jasta oxide, boran oxide or aluminium oxide bhi hona chahie
 Optical properties- Optical properties in lenses, such as high alternation and deflection, are also dependent on the amount of different oxides in the glass and therefore reducing the amounts of sis oxide, barium oxide, and calcium to produce valuable swatches of particular frequency and deflection
 Can go parabangnee prakaash ke pargaman ke liye pardavashpadip kaa kaach kaachiya silica kaa banaaya jaataa he, kyonki ye rashmiyaan saadhaaran vyapaarik kaach ke paar nahin ja sakati he; parantu dravit quartz ke paar ye saralata se ja sakati hai
 Viscosity - Viscosity is also an essential property in the construction of wood, because the blast, grinding, traction, and rolling of the stick depend very much on the viscosity of the stick; Elimination of deformity is also directly related to viscosity
 kaach kii shyanta kaach ke oxide avyavon par nirbhar karti he
 Increasing the amount of silica increases the viscosity of the glass; Viscosity increases with the growth of lime, but viscosity-range is reduced
 soda kii maatra badhaane se shyanta ghatati he, par shyanta-paraas badhata he
 When the slurry object is heated, the outside surface becomes hotter than the inner parts and similarly when the heated liquid slurry is cooled and solidified, the outer surface of the slab is more solid than the inside
 It gets cold
 taap main antar hone ke kaaran kaach main asmaan prasar yaa akunchan aa jaataa he, jiske falswaroop uske bheetar pratibal utpann ho jate hai or kaach main tadnurup vikrutiyaan aa jaati hai
 The sludge remains hot at the time of manufacture, so when cooled, stress and deformation occur in the sludge
 inako hataane kii kriya ko kaach kaa abhitaapan kaha jaataa he
 In this method, the items of the slag are again heated uniformly at a temperature less than the temperature of the slab
 isse shyanta ke parivartan ke kaaran kaach vikrutiyon se mukt ho jaataa he
 The kach is then cooled very slowly
 yah abhitaapan-paraas bhi kaach ke oxide avyavon par nirbhar rahata he
 More alkali slabs can be impregnated at sufficiently low temperatures
 jatil kaach kaa, jaise rasinic kaach ushma pratirohak kaach kaa, abhitaapan taap bahut unchaa hota he
 There is a lot of convergence in optical waves; Because they have to cool very slowly in which they are often deformed

 There is a possibility of chemical activity of liquids for a long time on the kitchens in which the pot, food or drink is kept
 sabhi rasinic kaach-vastuon ko jal, amla or kshar kaa sanksharan sahanaa padataa he
 Doorways and optical masks have to endure weather
 at: yah aavashyak he ki in kaachon main aise gun hon ki purvokt sanksharanon kaa unpar nunatam prabhaav pade
 The stability of the sachets is dependent on the amount of different oxide components of the sachets
 sthayitv badhaane ke liye sarvottam padaarth jasta oxide he or iske baad aluminium, magnisium or calcium oxide hai
 The stability of the kach decreases with the addition of alkali
 boric oxide 12 pratishat tak kaach kaa sthayitv badhaata he or taduparant sthayitv ghatata he
 Increasing silica in place of alkaline oxides also increases stability
 rangeen kaachon ke nirmaan ke liye vibhinn prakaar ke varnakon ko kaach-mishran main daalaa jaataa he

 kathantargat "kaaryavyapaar kii yojana" ko kathanak kehete hai
 Both the words "story" and "story" originate from the Sanskrit "katha" metal
 sanskrit sahityashastra main "katha' shabd kaa prayog ek nishchit kavyarup ke arth main kiya jaataa rahaa he kintu katha shabd kaa saamaanya arth he-"vah jo kaha jaae'
 Here the presence of the hearer as well as the hearer is also ingrained because the word "say" is meaningful only when there is someone to listen to it
 shrota ke abhaav main keval "bolne' yaa "badbadaane' kii kalpana kii ja sakati he, "kehane' kii nahin
 At the same time, he does not fall within the limits of the "whatever is said" story

 Forster calls the story "chronological description of events"; eg, mid-day meal after breakfast, Tuesday after Monday, old age after puberty
 iske vipareet kathanak kaa vah tatv he jo usamen varnit kalkram se shrinkhalit ghatnaon kii dhuree banakar unhen sangati detaa he or katha kii samast ghatnaayen jiske chaaron or taane bane kii tarah buni jaakar badhati or viksit hoti hai
 a story or a story is also usually a business plan, but no single story can be called a story; Because, the uniqueness of the narrative only overwhelms its chronological description
 "nayak ko nayika se prem hua or ant main usne uskaa varan kar liya
 '- is the story
 "nayak ne nayika ko dekha, vah usapar anurakt ho gaya
 By removing many obstacles to the attainment of his valor and dedication, in the end, he married the heroine
 '-kathanak he
 That is, the narrative is just the structure of any narrative literary work, whereas in the story, the form of the story emerges as clear, consistent and intelligent according to the content of the episode
 webstor ke anusaar kathanak kii paribhaasha is prakaar he- The above discussion inaugurates the important fact that while listening or reading the story, the listener or reader has the curiosity to know the events that follow, that is, he repeatedly asks or thinks what happened again, while in the plot He also raises the question "why did this happen?" "how did this happen?' e

 During the immersion, chemical changes take place in the active substance and electrolytes
 rin pattica kaa lead do electron,, se vanchit hota, jabaki dhan pattica kaa lead oxide do electron arjeet karata he
 The following reaction takes place on a loan board: dhan pattica par nimnlikhit samakalik abhikriya hoti he : Lead monoxide reacts with sulfuric acid to produce the following fruits: visarjan kaal main dhan or rin donon patticas lead sulphate se aachhadit ho jaati hai
 At this time the relative density of electrolytes, ie, sulfuric acid, decreases, because some sulfuric acid is converted into water

 1900 main romania ne pehali baar olympic khelon main bhaag liya, ek ekal pratibhaagi ke saath
 The National Olympic Committee for Romania is the Romanian Olympic and Sports Committee, and was created and recognized in 1914
 raashtra ne pehali baar 1924 main khelon main pratispardhaa karne ke liye ek team bheji, or uske baad se keval do sanskarnon ko greeshmakaleen olympic khelon or sheetakaaleen olympic khelon main se keval yaad kiya
 Notably, Romania was the only Eastern bloc nation to participate in the 1984 Summer Olympics, which was boycotted by other countries
 yah romania kaa sabase safal olympic khelon bhi tha: unhone 20 swarna padak or kul 53 padak jite
 Gymnastics is Romania's top medal-making sport
 romania ne rashtron kii duusari sabase badi kul padak jeeta he, jinhone kabhi bhi khelon kii mejabani nahin kii he
 Syedism is the relative principle of understanding, explaining and expressing the qualities of an object under Jain philosophy
 jain matanusaar kisi bhi vastu ke anant gun hote hai
 It is only possible for a seeker who is free or Kaivalya to know the eternal qualities
 saadhaaran manushyon kaa gyaan aanshik or saapeksh hota he
 This partial knowledge of the object is called new in Jain philosophy
 nay kisi bhi vastu ko samajhane ke vibhinn drushtikon hai
 These are called partial forms of new truth
 aanshik or saapeksh gyaan se saapeksh satya kii prapti hi sambhav he, nirpeksh satya kii prapti nahin
 Due to the attainment of relative truth, the decision of an ordinary person in relation to anything cannot be true in all respects
 logon ke bich matbhed rahane kaa kaaran yah he ki vah apane vichaaron ko nitant satya maanane lagate hai or duusare ke vichaaron kii upeksha karte hai
 In order to express ideas logically and to show the importance of the relativity of knowledge, Jain philosophy has proposed the principle of Syedvad or Saptabhangi Nay
 saapekshik gyaan kaa bodh karaane ke liye jain darshan main prayek nay ke aarambh main syat shavd ke prayog kaa nirdesh kiya gaya he
 It should be noted here that 'syat' does not mean 'perhaps'
 jainiyon ne iskaa udhaaharan ek hathi or chah netraheen vyaktiyon ke madhyam se diya he
 All blind provide a sense of the availability of knowledge and the extent of access to it
 yadi koi hathi ko simit anubhav ke aadhaar par kahe ki hathi khambhe, rassi, diwaar, ajgar yaa pankhe jaisaa bataaye to vah uske aanshik gyaan or saapeksh satya ko hi vyakt karata he
 If the word 'syat' is added to this experience, the vote is considered flawless
 arthath, yadi kaha jaay ki- 'syat hathi khambhe yaa rassi ke samaan he' to mat taarkik rup se sahi mana jaayga
 There are seven types of judgments or judgments in Jain philosophy based on the rationality of relative knowledge
 jain darshan dwaara anubhavik nirnay yaa mat ke is vargeekaran ko hi saptabhangi nay kaha jaataa he
 This is the first opinion
 udhaaharan ke taur par yadi kaha jaay ki 'syat hathi khambhe jaisaa he' to uskaa arth hoga ki kisi vishesh desh, kaal or paristhiti main hathi khambhe jaisaa he
 This opinion is emotional
 yah sahi baat he
 There is no doubt about it
 yah ek abhavatmak mat he
 In this perspective, there should be a view of elephants in such a way that a black elephant is not inside this room
 iskaa arth yah nahin he ki kamare main koi hathi nahin he
 The word Syatam makes sense of the fact that elephant of particular form, color, shape and type is not within this room
 jiske bodh main hathi diwaar yaa rassi kii tarah he uske liye abhavatmak mat ke rup main is nay kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Syat word signifies the elephant who is not present in the room at the time of vote
 is mat kaa arth he ki vastu kii satta kisi vishesh drushtikon se ho bhi sakati he or nahin bhi
 Keeping the example of an elephant in mind, it may or may not be like a pillar
 aisi paristhitiyon main 'syat he or syat nahin he' kaa hi prayog ho saktaa he
 If one has to think together about conflicting qualities in one opinion, then the subject of the subject is used
 hathi ke sambandh main kabhi aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki nishchit rup se nahin kaha ja sake ki vah khambhe jaisaa he yaa rassi jaisaa
 In such a situation, samyak avtavyaam is used
 kuch aise prashn hote hai jinke sambandh main maun rahanaa, yaa yah kahana ki iske bare main nishchit rup se kuch bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa, uchit hota he
 This fourth consultation of Jain philosophy is proof that they accept opposition as a defect
 koi vastu yaa ghatana ek hi samay main ho sakati he or phir bhi sambhav he ki uske vishay main kuch kaha na ja sake
 From a particular point of view, an elephant can be called a rope
 parantu drushti kaa spasht sanket na ho to hathi ke swaroop kaa varnan asambhav ho jaataa he
 Hence elephant is rope-like and indescribable
 jainon kaa yah paraamarsh pehle or chauthe nay ko jodne se praapt hota he
 From a particular point of view it is possible to say 'no' in relation to any object or event, but if the vision is not clear, nothing can be said
 atah hathi rassi jaisi nahin he or avarnaneey bhi he
 This consultation is obtained by mixing the second and fourth nay
 is mat ke anusaar ek drushti se hathi rassi jaisi he, duusari drushti se nahin he or jab drushtikon aspasht ho to avarnaneey bhi he
 This consultation is made by combining the third and fourth nayas
