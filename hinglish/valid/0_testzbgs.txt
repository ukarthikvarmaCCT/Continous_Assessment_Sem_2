 Idiom is basically an Arabic language word meaning to talk or answer
 kuch log muhaavarey ko ‘rozmarra’, ‘bolchaal’, ‘tarzeklam’, yaa ‘istalah’ kehete hai, kintu inamen se koi bhi shabd ‘muhaavarey’ kaa purna paryaayavachi nahin ban sakaa
 No Sanskrit synonyms are found in Sanskrit
 kuch log iske liye ‘prayuktata’, ‘vaagrithi’, ‘vaagdhara’ athwa ‘bhashaa-sampradaay’ kaa prayog karte hai
 VS Apte in his english-sanskrit dictionary has written the words 'speech-method', 'speech manner', 'speech-behavior' and 'specific form' in synonyms of the idiom
 paradkar ji ne ‘vaak-sampradaay’ ko muhaavarey kaa paryaayavachi mana he
 Kaka Kalelkar has suggested the word 'conservatism' for 'idiom' to 'eloquence'
 unani bhashaa main ‘muhaavarey’ ko ‘idioma’, french main ‘indiatismi’ or angreji main ‘edium’ kehete hai
 Broadly, the structured word that derives some specific meaning from the symptomatic and sometimes euphemistic is called idiom
 kai baar yah vyangyatmak bhi hote hai
 The idioms make the language strong, dynamic and interesting
 muhaavaron ke prayog se bhashaa main adbhut chitramyata aati he
 Without idioms, the language becomes dull, dull and soulless
 hindi bhashaa main bahut adhik prachlit or logon ke munhchadhe vaakya lokokti ke taur par jane jate hai
 These sentences contain the essence of the public experience
 vibhinn vidwaanon ne vibhinn prakaar se ‘muhaavarey’ kii paribhaasha kii he jinamein se kuchhek yahan di ja rahi hai: Dr
 Uday Narayan Tiwari has written- ‘advance larners dictionari’ main e0es0 hornbi ne likhaa he ki According to 'chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary', 'oxford canceiese dictionari' ke anusaar, The most comprehensive and satisfying definition of 'idiom' is given by Dr
 Omprakash Gupta in the following words: muhaavarey bhashaa kii neenv ke pathar hai jis par uskaa bhavy bhawan aaj tak rukaa hua he or muhaavarey hi uski tut-foot ko thik karte hue garmi, sardi or barsaat ke prakope se ab tak uski raksha karte chale aa rahe hai
 The idioms make the language strong, dynamic and interesting
 unke prayog se bhashaa main chitramyata aati he jaise-apane pairon par kulhadi maarna, daanton tale ungali dabaanaa, ranga siyaar hona aadi
 Words have three powers: jab kisi shabd yaa shabd-samooh kaa saamaanya arth main prayog hota he, tab vahaan uski abhidha shakti hoti he
 The expression meaning by abhidha is called abhidhayartha or mainartha; For example, 'to climb on the head' means to lift something from a place and place it on the head
 parantu jab mukhyarth kaa bodh na ho or roodhi yaa prasiddh ke kaaran athwa kisi vishesh prayojan ko suchit karne ke liye, mukhyarth se sambhddha kisi anya arth kaa gyaan ho tab jis shakti ke dwaara aisa hota he use lakshana kehete hai
 This power is 'arpit' meaning
 isiilie ‘sahityadarpan’ main vishwanath ne likhaa he : To 'climb on the head' from the symptom would mean reverence
 mammat ne bhi ‘kavy prakaash’ main or adhik bodhgamy shabdon main unke abhimath kaa samarthan kiya he
 For example, "rolling on the coals", "winking", "night in the eye", "playing with fire", "lighting the sky", "shedding milk and ghee", "sucking blood", "peace" Symbolic power has been used in playing 'banshi', 'laughing', 'long arm', 'vijay's dancer' and becoming a lion '
 isliye ve muhaavarey hai
 But it is visible from this context that not all examples of symptoms can come under idioms
 lakshana ke keval vahi udhaaharan muhaavaron ke antargat aa sakate hai jo chir abhyaas ke kaaran rudha yaa prasiddh ho gaye hai
 When Abhidha and Lakshana are relieved by doing their work, then the power through which information is given to any meaning of word-groups or sentences is called 'vyanjana'
 muhaavaron main jo vyangyarth rahata he, vah kisi ek shabd ke arth ke kaaran nahin balki sab shabdon ke shrinkhalit arthon ke kaaran hota he, athwa yah kahen ki puure muhaavarey ke arth main rahata he
 Thus the satirical meaning of the phrase 'to climb on the head' depends neither on 'head' nor on 'offering', but the whole idiom means' disorderly, indiscipline or insolent
 ’ yah vyangyarth abhidheyarth tathaa lakshana abhivyakti arth se bhinn hota he
