 This is the reason that variation is not found in any other era like the deposits of Chakmay Kalpa
 chaakmay kalp ke sanstar sansar main kai sthanon par milte hai jinamein europe, uttari africa, austrailia, bharatvarsh, uttari china or america mukhya hai

 In this way, the mean Sun clocks are purified by keeping the constellation clock pure
 yamyottar yantra dwaara vedh karne main vyaktigat ashuddhi kii adhik sambhaavna he
 Therefore, the constellation time of the post-skipping time of stars is also known from the camera with fixed telescopes

 ek cricket mukaable main 11 khilaadiyon ke do dal hote hai ise ghaas ke maidan main khelaa jaataa he, jiske kendra main bhoomi kii ek samtal lambi pattee hoti he jise pich kehete hai
 The wicket is made of wood, which is placed at each end of the pitch and used as a target
 gendbaaj kshetrarakshan team kaa ek khilaadi hota he, jo gendbaaji ke liye ek sakht, chamade kii mutthi ke aakaar kii 5
5 ounce cricket kii gend ko ek wicket ke paas se duusare wicket kii or daalata he, jise vipakshi team ke ek khilaadi ballebaaj ke dwaara bachaaya jaataa he
 The ball usually eats once before reaching the batsman
 apane wicket kii raksha karne ke liye ballebaaj lakdi ke cricket ke balle se gend ko kheltaa he
 Meanwhile, other members of the bowler's team stand in different positions as fielders on the field, these players try to catch the ball to prevent the batsman from making a run and try to dismiss him if possible
 We do
 ballebaaj yadi out nahin hota he to wo viketon ke bich main bhaag kar duusare ballebaaj se apni sthiti ko badal saktaa he, jo pich ke duusari ore khadaa hota he
 Thus, once the situation is changed, a run is scored
 yadi ballebaaj gend ko maidan kii simarekha tak hit kar detaa he to bhi ran ban jate hai
 The number of runs scored and the number of players out are the main factors determining the outcome of the match
 yah kai baton par nirbhar karata he ki cricket ke khel ko khatm hone main kitna samay lagegaa
 In professional cricket this limit can range from 20 overs to 5 days for each side
 khel kii avadhi ke aadhaar par vibhinn niyam hai jo khel main jeet, haar, anirnit, yaa barabari kaa nirdhaaran karte hai
 Cricket is primarily an outdoor sport and some matches are also played in artificial light
 udhaaharan ke liye, garmi ke mausam main ise sanyukt rajshahi, australia, newjiland or dakshin africa main khelaa jaataa he jabaki west indies, bharat, pakistan, srilanka or bangladesh main zyaadaatar monsoon ke baad sardiyon main khelaa jaataa he

 Although men cannot play women's cricket, as per rules, women can play in men's team
 mukhya rup se bhartiya upmahadweep, austrailia, united kingdom, ireland, dakshini africa or westeindies main cricket kaa paalan kiya jaataa he
 The rules are in the form of codes, called laws of cricket and are maintained by the Marylebone Cricket Club in London
 isamen ai si si or anya gharelu bordon kaa paraamarsh bhi shaamil hota he
 a cricket match is played between two parties or sides

 Its ground can be of many shapes and sizes
 maidan ghaas kaa hota he or ise groundsman ke dwaara taiyaar kiya jaataa he, jiske kaary main urvaran, kataai, rolling or sataha ko samtal karnaa shaamil hota he
 The diameter of the field is 140–160 gaz
 maidan kii paridhi ko seemaa kaha jaataa he or ise kabhi kabhi rang diya jaataa he yaa kabhi kabhi ek rassi ke dwaara maidan kii bahari seemaa ko chihnit kiya jaataa he
 The ground can be round, square or oval, the most famous ground in cricket is the Oval
 prayek team kaa uddeshy hota he duusari team se adhik ran bananaa or duusari team ke sabhi khilaadiyon ko out karnaa
 In cricket, the game can be won by scoring more runs even if the other team has not been completely dismissed
 duusare rup main khel ko jeetne ke liye adhik ran bananaa or duusari team ko out karnaa jaruri hota he, anyathaa muqabla bina kisi nattejey ke samaapt ho jaataa he
 Before the game begins, the captains of both teams bounce a coin to determine which team will bat or bowl first
 toss jeetne vaala captain pich or mausam kii vartmaan or pratyaashit sthiti ke anusaar apana faisla letaa he
 The main attraction takes place in a specially designed area of the ground known as "pitch"
 pich ke donon or 22 gaz wicket lagaae jate hai
 These are targets for the bowling aka fielding side and are defended by the batting side who are trying to score runs
 multah ek ran tab banataa he jab ek ballebaaj gend ko apane balle se maarane ke baad pich ke bich bhaagta he, haalaanki neeche bataaye gaye vivaran ke anusaar ran banane ke kai or tareeke hai
 If the batsman does not attempt to score more runs, the ball is "dead" and returned to the bowler for bowling
 gendbaaji paksh vibhinn tareekon se ballebaajon ko out karne kii koshish karata he jab tak ballebaaji paksh "aal out" na ho jaae
 The bowling side then bats and the batting side comes to the "ground" for bowling
 peshewar maichon main, khel ke dauraan maidan par 15 log hote hai
 Two of these are the umpires who control the movements that take place in the field
 do ballebaaj hote hai, unamem se ek striker hota he jo gend kaa saamana karata he or or doosraa non striker kaha jaataa he
 The role of batsmen varies as runs are scored and overs are completed
 kshetrarakshan team ke sabhi 11 khilaadi ek saath maidan par hote hai
 One of them is a bowler, the other is called wicketkeeper and the other nine fielders
 wicketiper hameshaa ek visheshgy hota he lekin gendbaaji ke liye kisi bhi kshetrarakshak ko bulaayaa ja saktaa he
 The pitch is the length between the wickets and is wide
 yah ek samtal sataha he, is par bahut hi kam ghaas hoti he jo khel ke saath kam ho sakati he
 The "condition" of the pitch influences the match and the team's strategy, the current and anticipated condition of the pitch determines the team's strategy
 prayek wicket main teen lakdi ke stump hote hai jinhen ek sidhi rekha main rakhaa jaataa he inke upar do lakdi ke bels krij yaa baling krij yaa do "ritern" krij kehalaati hai
 The stumps are placed in the line of the bowling crease and are spaced a short distance from each other
 bich vaali stump ko bilkul kendra par gendbaaji krij kii lambaai main rakhaa jaataa he popping krij kii lambaai samaan hoti he, yah gendbaaji kii krij ke samaantar hoti he or wicket ke saamne hoti he
 The return crease is perpendicular to the rest of the two; Both of these are attached to the end of the popping crease and are painted at least in length to the end of the bowling crease
 gendbaaji karte samay gendbaaj kaa pichhlaa pair uski "delivery strid" main do ritern krijon ke bich main hona chahie, jabaki uskaa aglaa pair popping krij ke upar yaa uske peeche padhanaa chahie
 If the bowler breaks this rule, the umpire declares "no ball"
 ballebaaj ke liye popping krij kaa mahatva yah he ki yah uske surakshit kshetra kii seemaa ko nirdhaarit karata he jab vah "apane is kshetra se baahar" hota he to uskaa wicket ukhaad die jane par vah stump yaa ran out ho saktaa he | The stability of the pitch can vary, which can cause the bounce, spin and speed of the bowler to vary
 sakht pich par ballebaaji karnaa aasaan hota he, kyon kii is par oochaal unchaa lekin samaan hota he
 a dry pitch is considered bad for batting because it cracks and when this happens the spinner can play an important role
 nam pich yaa ghaas se dhaki pichen achche tej gendbaaj ko atirikt oochaal dene main madad karti he
 This type of pitch helps the fast bowler during the entire match, but as the match progresses it becomes even better for batting
 is khel kaa saar he ki ek gendbaaj apni ore kii pich se ballebaaj kii taraf gend daalata he jo duusare ant par balla lekar use "strike" karne ke liye taiyaar rahata he
 The bat is made of wood and has a blade-like shape and cylindrical handle at the top
 blade kii chaudai se adhik nahin honi chahie or balle kii kul lambaai se adhik nahin honi chahie The ball is a hard leather ball whose circumference is the hardness of the ball that can be thrown at a greater speed, a considerable issue and the batsman wears protective clothing including trees, batting gloves for hands, helmets for heads
 And a box that is worn inside the trousers and protects the crochet area
 kuch ballebaaj apni shart or patalun ke andar atirikt peding pahante hai jaise thai ped, arm ped, rib sangrakshak or kandhe ke pad The game is controlled by two umpires on the field, one of them standing behind the wicket towards the bowler and the other in a "square leg" position a few yards behind the striking batsman
 jab gendbaaj gend daalata he to wicket vaala ampaire gendbaaj or non striker ke bich rahata he
 If there is some doubt on the state of the game, the umpire consults and if necessary, he can postpone the match by taking the players out of the field, such as when it rains or lights are down
 maidan se bahaar or tii ve par prasaarit hone vaale maichon main aksar ek teesraa ampire hota he jo video sakshya kii sahaayta se vishesh sthitiyon main faisalaa le saktaa he
 a third umpire is required in Test matches and limited overs international games played between two ICC full members
 in maichon main ek match referi bhi hota he jiskaa kaam he yah sunishchit karnaa hota he ki khel cricket ke niyamon ke tahat khel kii bhaavana se khelaa jaye| Off the field, two official scorers keep a record of runs scored and dismissed, each from a team
 scorer ampire ke haath ke sanketon dwaara nirdeshit hote hai
 For example, the umpire raises a forefinger to indicate that the batsman is out; And if the batsman has scored six runs, then he raises both hands
 scorer cricket ke niyamon ke anusaar sabhi ranon, viketon or overon kaa record rakhte hai
 In practice, they also store additional data such as bowling analysis and run rates
 pari ballebaaji paksh ke samuhik pradarshan ke liye ek shabd he
 In theory, all eleven members of the batting side bat alternately, but the "innings" may end before that for many reasons
 khele ja rahe match ke prakaar ke anusaar har team kii ek yaa do pariyaan hoti hai
 The term "innings" is also sometimes used to describe a batsman's personal contribution
 gendbaaj kaa mukhya uddeshy kshetrarakshakon kii sahaayta se ballebaaj ko out karnaa hota he
 When a batsman is dismissed, it is said that he is "out", that is, he will have to leave the field and the next batsman of his team will now come to bat
 When ten batsmen are dismissed, the entire team is dismissed and the innings is over
 antim ballebaaj, jo out nahin hua he, vah ab ballebaaji nahin kar saktaa kyonki hameshaa do ballebaajon ko ek saath maidan main rahanaa hota he
 This batsman is called "not out"
 yadi das ballebaajon ke out hone se pehle hi ek pari samaapt ho jaae to do ballebaaj "note out" kehalaate hai
 An innings can end quickly for three reasons: if the batting side's captain declares that the fairy has ended, or the batting side has achieved its goal and won the game, or the game is over a bad season or time
 Be terminated because it has happened
 In limited overs cricket, two batsmen may still be left when the last over is being done
 over yaa shatak 6 gendon kaa samucchy yaa samooh hota he
 The word came in this way because the umpire says "over"
 jab 6 genden daali ja chuki hoti hai, tab doosraa gendbaaj duusare chor par aa jaataa he or kshetrarakshak bhi apana sthaan badal lete hai
 a bowler cannot bowl two consecutive overs, although a bowler can bowl multiple overs from the same end without changing the end
 ballebaaj said yaa chor ko badal nahin sakate hai, isliye jo non striker tha vah striker ban jaataa he or striker ab non striker ban jaataa he
 The umpires also change their position so that the umpire who was in square leg position goes behind the wicket and vice versa
 ek team main 11 khilaadi hote hai
 a player can be classified as a batsman or bowler on the basis of primary skill
 ek acchhee tarah se santulit team main aamtaur par paanch yaa chah visheshgy ballebaaj or chaar yaa paanch visheshgy gendbaaj hote hai
 There is always a specialist wicket keeper in the team as this fielding position is very important
 prayek team kaa netritv captain karata he jo samrik nirnay lene ke liye jimmedaar hota he, jaise ballebaaji kram kaa nirdhaaran karnaa, kshetrarakshakon ke sthaan nirdhaarit karnaa or gendbaajon kii baari tay karnaa
 a player who specializes in both batting and bowling is called an all-rounder
 jo ballebaaj or wicket keeper donon kaa kaam karata he vah "wicket keeper / ballebaaj" kehalaata he, kabhi kabhi use harfanmaulaa bhi kaha jaataa he, vastav main harfanmaulaa khilaadi kam hi dekhne ko milte hai kyonki adhikansh khilaadi ballebaaji yaa gendbaaji main se kisi ek par hi dhyaan kendrit karte hai
 All eleven players from the fielding side remain together in the field
 unamem se ek wicket keeper urf"keeper" hota he jo striker ballebaaj ke dwaara bachaae jane vaale wicket ke peeche khadaa rahata he
 Wicket-keeping can usually be done by a specialist, whose main short is to catch balls that the batsman does not hit
 jisase kii ballebaaj bai ke ran naa le sake
 He wears special gloves, as well as pads to cover his lower legs
 chunki vah sidhe striker ke peeche khadaa rahata he, at: uske paas is baat kii bahut adhik sambhaavna hoti he ki wo ballebaaj ke balle ke kinare se chhu kar nikalati hui ball ko kaich karke ballebaaj ko out kar sake
 He is the only player who can get a batsman stumped out
 vartmaan gendbaaj ke alaava shesh 9 kshetra rakshak captain ke dwaara maidan main chune hue sthanon par tainaat rahete hai
 These places are not fixed but they are known by special and sometimes good names such as "slip", "third man", "silly mid on" and "long leg"
 There are always some unsafe areas
 captain kshetrarakshan paksh kaa sabase mahatvapurn sadsy hota he kyonki vah sabhi ranneetiyaan nirdhaarit karata he, jaise kise gendbaaji kerani chahie ; or vah "kshetra kii setting" ke liye bhi jimmedaar hota he
 In all forms of cricket, if a fielder is injured or ill during a match, someone else can be replaced
 pratisthapit khilaadi gendbaazi, captaini yaa wicket keeping nahin kar saktaa ha| yadi ghayal khilaadi thik hokar waapas maidan main aa jaae to atirikt khilaadi ko maidan chhodana hota he
 Bowlers often come to the ball to run, although some bowlers run only one or two steps and throw the ball
 ek tej gendbaaj ko samveg kii zarurat hoti he jiske kaaran vah teji se or duuri se daud kar aata he
 The fast bowler can bowl the ball very fast and sometimes he bowls a very fast ball to get the batsman out, which causes the batsman to react quickly
 anya tej gendbaaj gati ke saath saath kismat par bhi bharosa karte hai
 Many fast bowlers place the ball in such a way that it "swings" or "swings" in the air
 is prakaar kii delivery ballebaaj ko dhokhaa de sakati he jiske kaaran uske shot khilne kii timming galat ho jaati hai, jisase gend balle ke bahari kinare ko chooti hui nikalati he or use wicket keeper yaa slip kshetra rakshak ke dwaara kech kiya ja saktaa he
 Another type of bowler is the "spinner" who bowls a slow spin and tries to deceive the batsman
 ek spinner aksar “wicket lene ke liye” gend ko thodaa upar se daalata he or ballebaaj ko galat shot khilne ke liye uksaata he
 The batsman has to be very careful with such balls because this ball often comes very high and rotating and does not behave in the way the batsman thought it would and could be out
 tej gendbaaz or spinner ke madhya hote hai "madhyamgati ke gendbaaz" jo apni sateek gendbaaji se ranon kii gati ko kam karne par bharosa karte hai or ballebaajon kaa dhyaan bhang karte hai
 All bowlers are classified according to their speed and style
 zyada cricket shabdaawalee ke anusaar vargeekaran bahut bhramit kar sakate hai
 In this way a bowler can be classified into LF which means left-handed fast bowler or LBG which means right-arm spin bowler who put "leg break" or "googly"
 Can
 gendbaaji ke dauraan kohni ko kisi bhi kone par rakhaa ja saktaa he yaa modaa ja saktaa he lekin is dauraan use sidhaa nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 If the elbow straightens illegally, the square leg umpire may declare it a no ball
 vartmaan niyamon ke anusaar ek gendbaaj apni bhujaa ko 15 degree yaa usase kam tak sidhaa kar saktaa he
 At any one time, there are two batsmen in the field
 ek striker chor par rah kar wicket kii raksha karata he or sambhav ho to ran banaata he
 His partner, who is a non-striker, is at the end from where the bowling is done
 ballebaaj ballebaaji kram main aate hai, yah kram captain ke dwaara nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he, pehle do ballebaaj "openar" kehalaate hai
 They usually face the most dangerous bowling, because the fast bowlers use the new ball at that time
 sheersh ballebaaji ke liye aam taur par team main sabase adhik sakasham ballebaaj ko bheja jaataa he or gaiyr ballebaajon ko ant main bheja jaataa he
 a previously determined batting order is not mandatory and whenever a wicket falls, any player who has not batted can be sent
 agar ek ballebaaj maidan chhod ke jaataa he or waapas nahin laut pataa he to vah vastav main "note out" hota he or uskaa bahaar janaa out nahin mana jaataa he, parantu use barkhaast kar diya jaataa he kyonki uski pari samaapt ho chuki hoti he
 Substituted batsmen are not allowed
 ek kushal ballebaaj surakshatmak or aakraamak donon roopon main kai prakaar ke "shot" yaa 'stroke' laga saktaa he
 The main task is to hit the ball with the flat surface of the bat
 yadi gend balle ke kinare ko chooti he to yah "bahari kinaaraa" kehalaata he
 The batsman does not always try to hit the ball vigorously, a good player can score runs with a light clever stroke or by simply twisting his wrist lightly
 lekin vah gend ko kshetrarakshakon se dur hit karata he taaki use ran banane kaa samay mil sake
 There are many types of shots played in cricket
 ballebaaj ke dwaara lagaaye gaye stroke ko gend ke swing yaa uski disha ke anusaar kai naam die ja sakate hai jaise "cat ” "drive","hook" yaa "pul"
 Note that the batsman does not have to play every shot, if he feels that the ball will not hit the wicket, he can "drop" the ball to go to the wicket keeper
 iske saath hi, vah jab apane balle se gend ko hit karata he to use ran lene kaa prayaas nahin karnaa hota he
 He can intentionally use his foot to stop the ball and take it off his leg but it can be risky according to the LBW rule
 yadi ek ghayal ballebaaj ballebaaji karne ke liye feet ho jaataa he lekin bhaag nahin saktaa ho to ampire or kshetrarakshan team kaa captain ballebaaji paksh ke ek anya sadsy ko dodane kii anumati de saktaa he
 If possible, this runner has to keep a bat with him
 is dhaavak kaa ek maatr kaam hota he ghayal ballebaaj ke sthaan par dodana
is dhaavak ko wo sabhi upkaran pahanane or uthaane hote hai jo ek ballebaaj ne pahane hai
 It is possible for both batsmen to have runners
 striker ballebaaj kii praathamikta hoti he gend ko wicket par takaraane se rokna
 or duusari praathamikta hoti he balle se gend ko hit kar ke ran bananaa taaki isse pehle ki kshetrarakshan paksh kii ore se gend waapas aae, use or uske sahyogi ko ran banane kaa samay mil jaae
 ek ran register karne ke liye, donon dhavakon ko apane balle se yaa sharir ke kisi bhaag se krij ke peeche kii bhoomi ko chhuna hota he
 Each run is added to the score
 ek hi hit par ek se adhik ran banaaye ja sakate hai, ek hit main ek se teen ran aam hai, maidan kaa aakaar is prakaar kaa hota he ki saamanyat: chaar yaa adhik ran bananaa kathin hota he
 To compensate for this, if the ball touches the ground boundary of the field it is counted as four runs
 or yadi gend seemaa ko hawa main paar karke nikal jaati he to ise chha: ran gina jaataa he
 If the ball crosses the boundary, the batsman does not need to run
 paanch ran bahut hi asaamaanya hai or aamtaur par yah kshetra rakshak ke dwaara waapas phenki gai gend, "over thro" par nirbhar karata he
 If the striker makes an odd number of runs, the batsmen are replaced by each other and the non-striker now becomes the striker
 keval striker hi vyaktigat rup se ran banataa he lekin sabhi ran team ke kul score main jode jate hai
 The decision to take a run is made by the batsman who has knowledge of the direction and speed of the ball and tells it by saying "yes", "no" or "stop"
 ran lene main bahut jokhim hota he kyonki yadi ek kshetra rakshak wicket ko gira detaa he, jab najdiki ballebaaj apni krij se baahar hota he to ballebaaj ran out kehalaata he
 a team's score is represented by the number of runs they have scored and the number of batsmen out
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi paanch ballebaaj out ho gaye hai or team ne 224 ran banaaye hai to kaha jaataa he ki unhone 5 wicket kii haani par 224 ran banaaye hai 
 The runs that the batting side gets due to errors made by and from the fielding side are called extra
 
 This can be achieved in four ways: wide – dand ke rup main di gai ek atirikt gend hoti he jo tab di jaati he jab gendbaaj aisi gend daalata he jo ballebaaj kii pahunch se baahar ho
 When a bowler bowls a wide or no ball, his team suffers a penalty as they have to bowl an extra ball which allows the batting side to score extra runs
 ballebaaj ko bhaag kar ran lenaa hi hota he taaki vah baij or leg baij kaa daawa kar sake
 But these runs only add to the team's total score, not the striker's individual score
 ek ballebaaj das tareeke se out ho saktaa he or kuch tareeke itane asaamaanya hai ki khel ke puure itihaas main iske bahut kam udhaaharan milte hai
 The most common types of dismissals are "bold", "ketch", "LBW", "run out", "stumped" and "hit wicket"
 Unusual methods are "to hit the ball twice", "to hit the ground"
 Interrupt "," handle the ball "and" time out "
 isse pehle ki ampire ballebaaj ke out hone kii ghoshnaa karen saamanyat: kshetrarakshan paksh kaa koi sadsy "apil" karata he
 This is "how's that?" This is done by speaking or shouting
 iskaa matlab he "haau is det?" yadi ampire apil se sahamat hai, to vah tarjani anguli uthaa kar kahata he "out!"anyathaa vah sir hilaa kar kahata he "note out"
apil us samay tej aawaaj main kii jaati he jab out hone kii paristhiti spasht na ho
 It is always in the LBW condition and often in the run out and stump conditions
 adhikansh maamalon main striker hi out hota he
 If the non-striker is out, he is run out, but he can be out by either obstructing the field, catching the ball or when time runs out
 ek ballebaaj bina out hue bhi maidan ko chhod saktaa he
 If he gets hurt or he is injured, he can leave temporarily, he is replaced by the next batsman
 ise ritred hart yaa ritred biimaar ke rup main darj kiya jaataa he
 The retired batsman is not out and may come again later
 ek achoota ballebaaj, ritair ho saktaa he use ritair out kaha jaataa he; jiskaa shrey kisi bhi khilaadi ko nahin jaataa he
 The batsman cannot be bowled, caught, leg before wicket, stumped hit wicket on no ball
 wo wide balpar bold, kech, leg bifor wicket, yaa ball ko do baar hit karne par out ho saktaa he
 Some of these types of outs can occur without the bowler bowling
 non-striker ballebaaj bhi ran out ho saktaa he yadi vah gendbaaj ke dwaara gend daalane se pehle krij ko chhod de or ek ballebaaj kshetrarakshan baadhit karne par yaa ritair out hone par kisi bhi samay out ho saktaa he
 Time out is dismissal without delivery
 out hone ke kisi bhi tareeke main, keval ek hi ballebaaj ek gend par out ho saktaa he
 An innings ends when: ek captain apni team kii pari ko samaapt ghoshit kar saktaa he jab uske kam se kam do ballebaaj note out hon, If the team playing later is dismissed by scoring less runs than the other side, then it is said that the team has lost by n runs
 yadi baad main khilne vaali team jeetne ke liye paryaapt ran bana leti he to kaha jaataa he ki vah n viketon se jeet gai
 Where n is the number of wickets left
 udahaaran ke liye yadi koi team keval 6 wicket kho kar virdohi team ke score ko paar kar leti he to kaha jaataa he ki vah "chaar wicket se match jeet gai he" In a two-innings match, the total score of the first and second innings of a team can be less than the total score of the first side of the other side
 tab kaha jaataa he ki team ek pari or n ranon se jeet gai he or use fir se ballebaaji karne kii koi zarurat nahin he: n donon tiimon kul score ke bich kaa antar he
 If the team batting at the end is all out and both sides have scored the same number of runs, the match is tied; This result is quite rare
 khel ke paramparaagat swaroop main, kisi bhi paksh ke jeetne se pehle yadi samay khatm ho jaataa he to khel ko dra ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 If there is only one innings for each side in the match, then the maximum number of balls for each innings is often fixed
 is tarah ke match "simit overon ke match" yaa "ek divasiy match" kehalaate hai or viketon kii sankhya ko dhyaan main na rakhte hue adhik ran banane vaali team jeet jaati he
 Which cannot be drawn
 yadi is prakaar kaa match asthaayee rup se karaab mausam ke kaaran baadhit ho jaataa he to ek jatil ganitiya sutara jo dakworth -louis paddati kehalaati he uske madhyam se ek nayaa lakshya score fir se aaklit kiya jaataa he
 a one-day match can also be declared "non-result" if predetermined overs have been bowled by one team and the game cannot be played further due to circumstances such as wet weather
 vyapak arthon main cricket ek bahu aiami khel he, ise khel ke paimaanon ke aadhaar par major cricket or miner cricket main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 a more appropriate division, especially in the terms of Major Cricket, is done between matches, with a total of two innings, with each team playing one innings
 ise purv main pratham shrenee cricket ke rup main janaa jaataa tha, isaki avadhi teen se paanch din hoti he, ; baad main inhen simit overon ke cricket ke rup main janaa jane laga kyonki prayek team praroopik rup se simit 50 over main genden daalati he, isaki purv nirdhaarit avadhi keval 1 din hoti he
 Typically, a two-innings match is given at least 6 hours of playing time per day
 simit overon ke match aksar 6 ghante yaa adhik main samaapt ho jate hai
 Apart from brief informal intervals for drinks, there are usually formal intervals for food and tea
 pariyon ke bich ek chota interval bhi hota he
 Historically, a form of cricket known as single wicket was highly successful and in the 18th and 19th centuries most of these events were given the status of main cricket
 is rup main, haalanki prayek team main 1 se 6 khilaadi hote the or ek samay main keval ek ballebaaj hota tha, use apni pari kii samaapti tak har gend kaa saamana karnaa hota tha
 Single wicket cricket has rarely been played since the inception of limited overs cricket
 test cricket pratham shrenee cricket ke sarvocch maanak he
 a Test match is an international fixture between teams representing countries that are full members of the ICC
 janvari 2005 main dakshin africa or england ke bich Although the term "test match" has not been used for a long time, it is believed to have originated between Australia and England in the Australian season in 1876–77
 iske baad aath anya rashtriya dalon ne test darja hasil kiya: dakshin africa, west indies, newjiland, bharat, pakistan, srilanka, zimbabwe or bangladesh 
 Later in 2006, Zimbabwe was suspended from Test status, as it could not compete with other teams

 west indies team main kai rajyon ke khilaadi hai, carabian, visheshkar barbados, guyana, jamaica, trinidad or tobagose or liverd dweep or wind ward dweep se khilaadi isamen shaamil hai
 Test matches between two teams are usually played in a group of houses known as "series"
 match 5 dinon tak chal sakate hai, saamaanya rup se ek shrinkhalaa main 3 se 5 match ho sakate hai
 Test matches that do not finish in the given time are drawn
 1882 ke baad se england or australia ke bich test shrinkhalaa ek trophy ke liye kheli jaati he jise di ashes ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Some other series also have individual trophies: for example, the Wisden Trophy for which there is competition between England and the West Indies; Frank Vorell Trophy for which there is competition between Australia and West Indies
 simit overon ke cricket ko kabhi kabhi ek divasiy antarrashtriya ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he kyonki har match ke liye ek din kaa samay hi nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he
 In practice, sometimes matches continue for another day if they are interrupted or postponed due to bad weather
 The main purpose of a limited overs match is to produce results and therefore a traditional draw is not possible; But many times the result is not declared when the score is tied or due to bad weather it has to be stopped in the middle
 Each team plays only one innings and faces a limited number of overs

 People with long-term and frequent, or close contact with people with TB have a particular risk of becoming infected, with infection rates up to 22%
 sakriy lekin ilaaj nahin kiye gayi tapedic se peedit vyakti prati varsh 10-15 logon ko sankramit kar saktaa he
 The prevalence should only be with those with active TB - people with latent infection are not considered contagious

 By isolating people suffering from active TB and placing them in the anti-tb drug regime, the flow of person-to-person spread can be effectively stopped
 prabhavi upachaar ke do saptaah ke baad, gairpratirodhi sakriy sankraman vaale log aam taur par dusron ke liye sankramak nahin rah jate hai
 If someone becomes infected, it usually takes three to four weeks for the newly infected person to become capable of transmitting the infection to another person

 The risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV increases by about 10% a year
 yadi prabhavi upachaar nahin diya jaataa he to, sakriy tibi ke maamalon main mrityu dar 66% tak he
 TB infection begins when mycobacteria reach the lung follicles, where they invade and replicate endosomes of alveolar macrophages

 Tuberculosis is classified as a granulomatous inflammatory disease
 macrophesso, tii limphocites, bi limphocites or fibroblast ve koshikaayen hai jo milakar grenuloma banaate hai jabaki limphosite, sankramit macrophesso ke chaaron ore hoti hai
 Granulomas inhibit the proliferation of mycobacteria and provide a local environment for the interplay of cells of the immune system
 jeevanu, grenuloma ke andar niskriy ho jate hai, jiske parinamswaroop avyakt sankraman hota he
 The development of abnormal cell death at the center of the tubercle is another feature of granuloma
 nagn ankhon se dekhne par, yah naram, safed paneer kii banaavat jaisaa hota he or casius necrosis kaha jaataa he
 If TB bacteria enter the bloodstream from an area of damaged tissue, they can spread throughout the body and form multiple centers of infection, all of which appear as small, white tubercles in the tissues
 yah tibi rog kaa ek gambhir rup he jo chote bacchon or echivi peedit logon main sabase adhik aam he, ise milliyari tapedic kaha jaataa he

 During active disease, some of these empty airways are connected to the bronchi and this material can come out in the form of phlegm

 Treatment with appropriate antibiotics can kill bacteria and make treatment possible
 thik ho jane par, prabhavit kshetra antat utakon dwaara pratisthapit ho jate hai
 Active tuberculosis is difficult to diagnose only on the basis of signs and symptoms, similarly diagnosing disease in people with weak immunity is difficult

 The prevention and control of tuberculosis is mainly dependent on vaccination of newborns and appropriate treatment of active cases
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke sanshodhit upachaar pathya ke madhyam se kuch safalataa hasil hui he or maamalon kii sankhya main thodi si kami aayi he
 The only available vaccine in 2011 is Bacillus calmette-guérin, which is effective in childhood disease and provides inconsistent protection against lung TB

 The tuberculosis classification system developed by the American Thoracic Society is being used primarily in public health programs
 tibi ke upachaar main antibiotic dawaaon kaa upyog karke bacteria ko maaraa jaataa he
 Effective TB treatment is difficult due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacteria cell wall, which inhibits the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective
 do sabase adhik istemaal kii jane vaali antibiotic dawaayein isoniyazid or riffampisin hai or upachaar, lambey samay kaa ho saktaa he jisame kai mahine lag sakate hai
 An antibiotic is commonly used in the treatment of latent TB, while a combination of several antibiotics is used in active TB disease to reduce the risk of bacteria developing antibiotic resistance
 avyakt sankramanon se peedit logon ko baad main jivan main sakriy tibi rog ke viksit hone se bachaav ke liye bhi upachaar diya jaataa he
 Direct treatment, ie a healthcare provider, takes care that people take their medicines

 The evidence in support of this case is weak when compared to this practice and people taking the medicines on their own independently
 lekin upachaar ke mahatv ko, logon ko yaad dilaane ke tareeke prabhavi dikhaai dete hai
 In 2010, a suggested six-month treatment of newly started pulmonary tuberculosis used a combination of antibiotics like rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the first two months, and only rifampicin and isonizid in the subsequent four months
 
 jin maamalon main isoniyazid ke liye ucch pratirodh hota he, unamem baad ke chaar maahon main athembuttol joda ja saktaa he
 If tuberculosis occurs again, before determining treatment it should be tested to determine which antibiotic it is sensitive to
 yadi ek se adhik dawa pratirodhi tibi kaa pataa chalaa he to 18 se 24 maheenon ke liye kam se kam chaar prabhavi antibiotic dawaaon ke saath upachaar kii sifarish kii jaati he
 Primary resistance occurs when a person becomes infected with a stress resistant to TB

 Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is long and requires more expensive drugs
 emdiar tibi ko sarvaadhik prabhavi, pehali pankti kii tibi dawaaon riffampisin or isoniyazid ke prati pratirodhi ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 Largely drug resistant TB is also resistant to three or six classes of second-line drugs
