 saanchaa:rupayasaanchaa:asia ki mudra The Hardy – Weinberg law is a theory of population genetics that has been independently introduced by both Hardy and Weinberg
 is niyam ke anusaar ek adarsh jansankhya main vibhinn aleel or ginotip kii aavritiyaan peedhee dar peedhee aparivartit rahati hai
 This rule will be fully applicable to the same population which follows these ideals: 1
 Generation is sexual only 2
 Only one generation remains at a time3
 Breeding is random 4
 Possibility of reproduction of both sexes is equal 5
 Population should be very large 6
 Both sexes have equal allele frequencies7
 The public is free from migration, change, or natural selection
 8
 utparivartan nahin ho
 Imagine a diploid population consisting of a mixture of alleles a and a and having frequencies f = p { \ displaystyle f = p} and f = q { \ displaystyle f = q} which are determined such that p + q
 = 1 { \ displaystyle p + q = 1}
 inke bal par ginotip kii aavritiyaan nikaalane par ham pate hai ki f = p 2 { \ displaystyle f=p^{2}}, f = 2 p q { \ displaystyle f=2pq}, or f = q 2 { \ displaystyle f=q^{2}} 
 We also find that f + f + f = 2 = 1 { \ displaystyle f + f + f = ^ {2} = 1}, giving us the genetic equilibrium
 is niyam ke udbhav ko samajhane hetu kalpana kijiye ek dwiguneet jeev jansankhya jisamen kisi ek prakaar ke swaroop ko sthapit karne vaali jin ke di
en
e
 main sthaan, jise visthal kehete hai, par a or a do prakaar ke aleel sthapit kiye ja sakate hon
 An example would be the pea-colored gene with two alleles, one giving green color g and the other yellow color g
 ab kyunki matar ek dwiguneet jeev he, har swaroop ko ye aleel jodiyon main nirdhaarit karte hai, jaise GG, Gg, yaa fir gg; aisa ek joda ginotip kehalaata he
 One pair is received from the father and the other from the mother
 inamen se ek jodidar prabhavi ho saktaa he or doosraa aprabhavi, jaise yahan g prabhavi he tathaa g aprabhavi
 This means that if any pair of GG or GG were added to the pea, its color would be green; And if the pair is gg then only the color will be yellow
 ab kalpana kijiye ki a or a kii aavritiyaan ek pratham peedhee main hon f 0 = p { \ displaystyle f_{0}=p}, f 0 = q { \ displaystyle f_{0}=q}, is prakaar nirdhaarit ki p + q = 1 { \ displaystyle p+q=1} 
 Take the frequencies of the genotypes AA, Aa, and aa, respectively, in the second generation containing the offspring of this generation, f 1 { \ displaystyle f_ {1}}, f 1 { \ displaystyle f_ {1}}, and f 1 { \ displaystyle f_ { 1}}, thus determined that f 1 + f 1 + f 1 = 1 { \ displaystyle f_ {1} + f_ {1} + f_ {1} = 1}
 ye aavritiyaan p { \ displaystyle p} tathaa q { \ displaystyle q} main sambhaavnaaon ke rup main likhi ja sakati hai: f 1 = p 2 { \ displaystyle f_ {1} = p ^ {2}} f 1 = pq + qp = 2 pq { \ displaystyle f_ {1} = pq + qp = 2pq} f 1 = q 2 { \ displaystyle f_ {1} = q ^ {2}} ab dwitiya peedhee ke har praani main ek ginotip kaa koi bhi aleel yaa to mata se aa saktaa he yaa pita se
 For example, if the child has an A, his parents must have either received an a from each of them, or with half the probability that only one of them would have received an A
 atah is dwitiya peedhee main a kii aavriti hogi f 1 = f 1 + 1 2 f 1 = p 2 + 1 2 = p = p = f 0 { \ displaystyle f_ {1} = f_ {1} + { \ frac {1} {2}} f_ {1} = p ^ {2} + { \ frac {1} {2}} = p = p = f_ {0}} f 1 = f 1 + 1 2 f 1 = q 2 + 1 2 = q = q = f 0 { \ displaystyle f_ {1} = f_ {1} + { \ frac {1} {2}} f_ {1} = q ^ {2} + { \ frac {1} {2}} = q = q = f_ {0}} jisase yah siddh hota he ki dono aleel kii aavritiyaan peedhee dar peedhee aparivartaneey rahengi
 We have used p + q = 1 { \ displaystyle p + q = 1} above here
 upar diye gaye aadarshon kaa sampoornatah koi bhi jansankhya paalan nahin kar paaegi kyonki pravaas, parivartan, yaa prakritik chayan kisi bhi jansankhya main lagaataar chalate rahete hai
 Due to these many times some visual forms start getting destroyed, due to these new forms also appear and continue to swell
 isi baat ko spasht karne hetu ham prakritik chayan kaa udhaaharan le sakate hai
 Then imagine an ideal population and the initial frequencies of two alleles a and a of a form, immediately after the emergence of all generations, take f 0 = p { \ displaystyle f_ {0} = p} and f 0 = q { \ 
 displaystyle f_ {0} = q}
 ab maan lijiye ki kramshah kisi bhi AA, Aa, yaa aa prakaar ke praani ke prajnan karne tak jivit rahane kii sambhaavna ω a a { \ displaystyle \ omega _{AA}}, ω a a { \ displaystyle \ omega _{aa}}, athwa ω a a { \ displaystyle \ omega _{aa}} he
 If these three were equal, the ratio of these types of beings would be: f 0: f 0: f 0 = p 2: 2 pq: q 2 { \ displaystyle f_ {0}: f_ {0}: f_ {0} = p ^ {2}: 2pq: q ^ {2}} And the same proportion goes to the next generation of beings
 kintu chayan ke kaaran ab yahi anupaat badalakar ho jayega: f 0 : f 0 : f 0 = f 1 : f 1 : f 1 = p 2 ω a a : 2 p q ω a a : q 2 ω a a { \ displaystyle f_{0}:f_{0}:f_{0}=f_{1}:f_{1}:f_{1}=p^{2} \ omega _{aa}:2pq \ omega _{aa}:q^{2} \ omega _{aa}} jisase ham paayenge ki agali peedhee ke bacchon main f 1 = f 1 + 1 2 f 1 = p 2 ω a a + p q ω a a p 2 ω a a + 2 p q ω a a + q 2 ω a a = p ω a ω ̄ { \ displaystyle f_{1}=f_{1}+{ \ frac {1}{2}}f_{1}={ \ frac {p^{2} \ omega _{aa}+pq \ omega _{aa}}{p^{2} \ omega _{aa}+2pq \ omega _{aa}+q^{2} \ omega _{aa}}}=p{ \ frac { \ omega _{A}}{ \ bar { \ omega xxrep 4 } f 1 = f 1 + 1 2 f 1 = q 2 ω a a + p q ω a a p 2 ω a a + 2 p q ω a a + q 2 ω a a = q ω a ω ̄ { \ displaystyle f_{1}=f_{1}+{ \ frac {1}{2}}f_{1}={ \ frac {q^{2} \ omega _{aa}+pq \ omega _{aa}}{p^{2} \ omega _{aa}+2pq \ omega _{aa}+q^{2} \ omega _{aa}}}=q{ \ frac { \ omega _{a}}{ \ bar { \ omega xxrep 4 } jo ki saamaanya taur par p { \ displaystyle p} or q { \ displaystyle q} se bhinn honge
 Here ω a = p ω AA + q ω a a { \ displaystyle \ omega _ {A} = p \ omega _ {AA} + q \ omega _ {aa}}, ω a = q ω aa + p ω a a { \ displaystyle \ omega _ {a} = q \ omega _ {aa} + p \ omega _ {aa}}, and ω ̄ = p 2 ω AA + 2 pq ω a a + q 2 ω aa { \ displaystyle { \ bar { \ omega}} = p ^ {2} \ omega _ {AA} + 2pq \ omega _ {aa} + q ^ {2} \ omega _ {aa}}
 yadi ω a > ω ̄ { \ displaystyle \ omega _{A}>{ \ bar { \ omega }}}, to jansankhya main a kii sankhya peedhee dar peedhee babbti jaaegi or chayan a ke anukool hoga; parantu yadi ω a < ω ̄ { \ displaystyle \ omega _{A}<{ \ bar { \ omega }}}, to a kii aavriti ghatati chali jaaegi, arthath chayan a ke dwaara nishchit drishy swaroop ke pratikul sthiti ke dwaara hota hoga
 Blindness is a disorder in which, although the eyes appear perfectly healthy from outside, they do not really have the ability to see anything clearly
 yah vikaar kabhi-kabhi janmajaat hota he tathaa kabhi-kabhi kisi rog ke updravaswaroop baad main bhi utpann ho jaataa he
 Loss of vision from birth is often found in one eye only
 pradhan kaaran netra kii aavartan sambandhi vikruti, visham drushti he tathaa iske saath hi saath us netra main nikatadrushti evam duuradrushti vikaar bhi rahata he
 On analyzing this reason, it becomes clear that this lack of vision can occur not later but congenital, because the spectacle distortion does not correct the image of the object on the right side of the eye, due to which the eye is not corrected by the glasses
 The result is that the task of seeing is not taken from that retina, due to which it is far from becoming proficient in the task of seeing, the retina is its natural power Also loses
 is prakaar kii avasthaa ko 'kaary sanlagnta janit mandadrushti' kehete hai
 Therefore, it is necessary that congenital or infantile cataract surgery should be performed quickly, so that the retina does not lose its strength due to non-functioning
 saat yaa aath varsh kii umr ke pashchaat utpann drushti baadha is prakaar kii sthiti utpann nahin karti
 In such type of patients, it should also be noted that even after examination with complete caution, giving glasses, does not show any benefit in the beginning, but only when the glasses are put on for a few days, then it starts to show some benefit, because It is practiced to see the useless retina slowly for a long time
 ekanetreey mandadrushti bahudhaa tiryak drushti kaa kaaran ban jaati he, kyonki is avasthaa main ek netra ke vikrut hone ke kaaran dwinetri drushti kaa kuch bhi mahatv nahin rahata
 The pupils and fundus remain in a natural state under blind vision in hysteria, but on examination, there is a spiral restriction in the visual field

 Throughout his lifetime, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles
 unhone 300 se adhik vaigyanik or 150 gaiyr-vaigyanik shodh-patr prakashit kiye
 In his 1965 lecture, Oppenheimer noted that Einstein's early writings had many errors that caused his publication to be delayed by nearly ten years: "a man whose errors took a long time to correct, how much Would be great "

 These four articles have contributed greatly to the foundation of modern physics and changed the thinking of people on space, time and matter
 ye chaar kagajaat hai: In 1900, Einstein's first research paper was on "capillary attraction", presented to Onlen der Physik
 yah 1901 main " "keshikatv ghatana se nishkarsh" sheershak ke saath prakashit kiya gaya
 Two papers published in 1902–1903 attempted to explain atomic phenomena through statistical means

 His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena
 unhone saapekshata ke siddhant ko vyakt kiya
 Which, according to Herman Minkowski, is known for the generalization of alternation alternately from space to space-time

 Since 1905 Einstein's research in relativity remained controversial for many years, although it was also accepted by many leading physicists such as Max Planck
 1905 ke ek patr main, oinstin bataaya kii ki prakaash swatah hi sthaneey kanon ke bane hote hai
 Einstein's light quanta hypothesis was rejected by almost all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Burr
 robert millican kii prakashavidyut prabhaav par vistrut prayog, tathaa compton bikharane kii maap ke saath, yah pariklpana saarvbhaumik rup se 1919 main sweekaar kar liya gaya
 Einstein concludes that each wave of frequency is associated with a collection of photons of energy
 unhone is bare main or adhik nahin bataaya, kyonki ve aashwast nahin the kii kaise kan, laharo se sambandhit hai
 But he suggested that this hypothesis could be explained by some experimental results, which were later specifically called the photoelectric effect
 1907 main, oinstin ne ek model prastaavit kiya, kii prayek parmaanu, ek jaali sanrachana main swatantra anuroop rup se dolan karata he
 In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently
 Einstein knew that real oscillations have different frequencies but still proposed this theory, because it was a clear demonstration of how quantum mechanics, in conventional mechanics, is associated with specific heat
 Can solve the problem
 peter dibai ne is model ko parishkrut kiya
 During the 1910s, it expanded to bring individual systems within the realm of quantum mechanics

 According to this theory- albert oinstin kaa is vishay main bahut bada yogadan rahaa he
 While traveling, Einstein wrote letters to his wife Elsa and adopted daughter Kadamuni Margot and Ilse
 ye patr, da hebrew uniwarsity main dekhe ja sakate hai
 Margot Einstein had allowed these private letters to be made available to the public, but at the same time requested that they not be done until twenty years after his death

 In 1946 Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historic black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree
 oinstin ne america main naslwad ke bare main bhaashan diya, unka kahana tha, "meraa iske bare main chup rahane kaa koi iraadaa nahin hai
 "A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had ever paid college education fees for black students
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh se purv, ek akhbaar ne apane ek kollam main ek sankshipt vivaran prakashit kiya kii oinstin ko america main itani acchhee tarah se janaa jaataa tha ki log unhen sadak par roak kar unke die siddhant kii vyakhya poochne lagate the
 Eventually he figured out a way to avoid this constant questioning
 ve unase kehete kii "maaf kijiye! mujhe log aksar professor oinstin samajhate hai par wo main nahin hoon
 "einstein has been the subject or inspiration of many novels, films, plays and musicals

 Frederick Golden of Time magazine once wrote that Einstein was "like a cartoonist's dream coming true"
 oinstin ne kai puraskaar or sammaan praapt kiye or 1922 main unhen bhautikee main "saidhantik bhautikee ke liye apni sevaaon, or visheshkar prakashvaidhut prabhaav kii khoj ke liye" nobel puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 If no nomination in 1921 met the criteria set by Alfred Nobel, then the award of 1921 went ahead and Einstein was awarded it in 1922

 After being born, as a creature grows up, its physical plan evolves as prescribed, although some animals go through life in the process of metamorphosis
 adhikansh jantu gatisheel hote hai, arthath apane aap or swatantra rup se gati kar sakate hai
 Most animals are also hostile, that is, they depend on other animals to live
 adhiktam gyaat jantu sangh 542 karod saal pehle cambrian visphot ke dauraan jeevashm record main samudri prajatiyon ke rup main prakat hue
 The word 'animal' comes from the Latin language Animaale, the Nutter of Animalis, and is derived from Anima, meaning living breath or spirit
 aam bol-chaal kii bhashaa main, is shabd kaa istemaal gaiyr-maanviya jaanwaron ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The biological definition of the term includes all members of the Kingdom Animalaya, including humans

 In most animals, the embryo passes through a blastula stage, a differential property of animals
 kuch apwaadon ke saath, sabase khaskar spanj or placosoa, jantuon ke sharir alag-alag utakon main vibhedit hote hai
 These include muscles, which are able to control contraction and movement, and nerve tissues, which send and respond to signals
 saath hi inamen ek praroopik aantarik pachan kaksh hota he jo 1 yaa 2 chhidron se yukt hota he
 Animals that have this type of organization are called metazoans, or eumetazoans when the former is commonly used for animals
 sabhi jantuon main eukeriotic koshikaayen hoti hai, jo colejan or pratyasth glycoprotein se bane bahirkoshikeey metrics se ghiri hoti hai

 Most animals receive energy indirectly from sunlight
 paudhe prakaash sanshleshan naamak ek prakriya ke dwaara is urja kaa prayog karke surya ke prakaash ko saadhaaran sharkara ke anu main parivartit kar dete hai
 The process of photosynthesis begins with carbon dioxide and water, converting sunlight energy into chemical energy, which accumulates in the bonds of glucose, releasing oxygen during the process
 ab is sharkara kaa upyog nirmaan ikaayiyon ke rup main hota he, jisase paudhe main vruddhi hoti he
 When animals eat these plants, the sugars produced by the plants are used by animals

 Instead, synthesized organisms and bacteria form the basis of the food chain
 ] There is a general belief that animals have evolved from a flagellate eukaryote
 unke nikatatam gyaat sajiv sambandhi hai koeno kashabhiki, colerd kashabhiki jinaki aakaariki vishisht spanjon ke koeno cites ke saamaan he
 Molecular studies place animals in a superfamily group, called opisthokonts, which also include animals from the koeno flagellum, fungi and some small parasitic protists
 pehle jeevashm jo jantuon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, lagbhag 610 million varsh purv, purvacambrian kaal ke ant main prakat hue or ye adiakaran yaa vendian biota kehalaate hai
 But these are difficult to relate to later fossils
 Some may represent the predecessors of modern associations, but they may be distinct groups, and it is also possible that they are not actually animals
 unhen chhod kar, adhiktam gyaat jantu sangh, 542 million varsh purv, cambrian yug ke dauraan, swatah hi prakat hue
 It is still disputed whether this phenomenon, called the Cambrian explosion, represents a sharp divergence between different groups or the changes in conditions that made fossilization possible
 haalaanki kuch puratatvigyaani or bhuvaigyanik bataate hai ki jantu pehle soche jane vaale samay se kaaphi pehle prakat hue, sambhawatah 1 billian varsh purv

 The discovery, which is very similar to these early fossil marks, has its origins in the present-day giant size single-organism Protista organism Gromia sphaerica, doubting their interpretation as evidence of early animal development
 lambey arase pehle se spanj ko anya praarambhik jantuon se bhinn mana jaataa tha
 As noted above, the complex organization found in most other associations is not found in them, their cells are differentiated, but in most cases not organized into separate tissues
 spanj tane rahit hote hai or aam taur par inke chhidron ke madhyam se jal khinch kar bhojan praapt karte hai
 Archaeocyatha, which have a fused skeleton, may represent a sponge or a different association

 The authors believe that sponges — or at least the sponges they have discovered — are not so primitive, but can instead be simplified secondary
 anya sangho main, tinophora or nideria, jinamein samudri anemon, coral or jelifish shaamil hai, trigyat samamit hote hai, inamen ek hi chhidr se yukt pachan kaksh hota he, jo mukh or guda donon kaa kaam karata he
 Both have distinctly differentiated tissues, but are not organized into organs

 That is why these animals are sometimes called diploblastic

 The body is tripleblastic, that is, all three reproductive layers are fully developed and tissues form differentiated organs
 pachan kaksh main do chhidr hote hai, ek mukh or ek guda, saath hi ek aantarik deh guha bhi hoti he jo ceylom yaa abhaasi deh guha bhi kehalaati he
 There are exceptions to each of these traits, however - adult echinoderms are radially symmetric and have very simplified physiological structures in typical parasitic animals
 anuvanshik adhyayan nen bailetria ke bheetar sambandh ko lekar hamaare gyaan ko kaaphi had tak badal diya he
 Most belong to two main genealogies : Deuterostomes and Protostomes, including Ecdysozoa, Platyzoa, and Lophotrochozoa
 is ke atirikt, dwiparshvasamamit jeevon ke kuch chote samooh hai jo in mukhya samoohon ke samaksh visarit hote hue prathit hote hai
 These include Aesolomorpha, Rhombozoa and Orthonectida
 aisa mana jaataa he ki mixojoa, ek koshikeey paraseete jinhen mul rup se protogon mana jaataa tha, bailetria se hi viksit hue hai
 Deuterostomes differ in many ways from other bilateria, protostomes
 donon hi maamalon main ek puraa pachan path paaya jaataa he
 However, in the protostome, the initial pore develops in the mouth and the anus develops separately
 duterostome main yah ulat he
 In most protostomes, cells normally fill in the inner part of the gastrula and form the middle reproductive level, this is called Schizosillus development, but in the deuterostome it is formed by the intracellular level of innervation, known as entrosylic pouching
 duterostome main adhar ke bajaay prishthiya tantrika rajju hota he or unke bhrun main bhinn prakaar kaa vidalan hota he
 All this suggests that deuterostomes and protostomes are distinctly federal levels
 duterostome ke pramukh sangh hai, ekainodermanta or cordeta
 The former is radially symmetric and is particularly marine, such as starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers
 duusare vaale main mukhya rup se kasheruki jeev hai jinamein ridh kii haddi pai jaati he
 These include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals
 inke atirikt duterostome main hemicordeta or ekon krimi bhi shaamil hai
 Although they are not currently found predominantly, significant fossil evidence relates to them
 chetognetha yaa tir krimi bhi duterostome ho sakate hai, lekin adhik haal hi main kiye gaye adhyayan protostome ke saath inke saannnidhya ko darshaate hai
 Ecdysozoa are protostomes, which have been named on the basis of a characteristic characteristic of growth by moulting or release

 Both groups have long been thought to be closely related, as tricophore larvae are found in both, but Annelida was thought to be much closer to Arthropoda
 kyonki ve donon hi khandit hote hai
 It is generally considered convergent evolution, as there are many morphological and genetic differences between the two associations
 lophotrocojoa main nimertia yaa ribbon krimi, sipunkula bhi shaamil hai or kai sangh jinamein mukh ke chaaron ore pakshmabhika kaa ek pankhaa hota he, lofophor kehalaate hai
 These were traditionally grouped with Lofo forites
 lekin ab aisa prathit hota he ki ve peraphilatic hai, kuch nimertia ke najdiki hai ore kuch molska va enelida ke najdiki hai
 These include Brachiopoda or Lemp shells, which are prominent in fossil records, Entroprocata, Phoronida, and possibly Bryozoa or Moss fauna

 Antarctica is the only continent of the earth where no humans originally lived, and this treaty system determines all international relations regarding Antarctica
 antarctic sandhi 1961 se lagu hui or san 2016 tak isapar 53 desh hastakshar kar chuke the
 Under this treaty, Antarctica was declared a scientifically protected area and any military action was banned on this continent
 saath hi antarctic ke maamalon par nirnay karne ke liye ek vaarshik "antarctic sandhi paraamarsh baithak" kii parampara shuru kii gai
 When the treaty was first signed, the seven countries claimed their sovereignty over the different regions of Antarctica, that is, those regions were described as part of their countries
 sandhi ne yah kaha ki koi bhi hastakshar karne vaala na to apane daawey se hat rahaa he, na kisi or kaa daawa maan rahaa he or na hi koi nayaa daawa karegaa
 For example, France considers the region called Adeli Earth of Antarctica as part of it, but under the treaty it is unable to convince this claim from anyone else

 After this, 30 lakhs were received in lieu of full release, along with the promise of no intervention by the company for life in the jagirs
 baad main begum kaa chaay singh ke vidroh main sahyog dene ke aarope main ye jaagiren jabt kar lee gayi, baad main is sahyog kaa dastavezi pramaan bhi mila
 From the evidence just found, it appears that Warren Hastings had tried his best to save the Nawab from his inefficiencies and was also very soft towards the Begums
 us samay avadh ko bharat kaa ann bhandar mana jaataa tha jo ki doaab kehalaae jane vaale ganga nadi or yamuna nadi ke bich kii upjau zamin ke kshetra par niyantran karne ke liye kootnithik drushti se bahut mahatvapurn tha

 1784 ke akaal main rojgaar utpann karne ke liye nawab ne ek khayrati pariyojna ke taur par ise shuru kiya tha
 In this famine, even the nobles had run out of money
 kaha jaataa he ki nawab aasaf ne is pariyojna main 20,000 se zyaada logon ko kaam diya, yah na masjid tha na kabrgah 
 The Nawab's sense of care about the dignity of the upper class can be gauged from the story of making Imambara
 din ke samay pariyojna main lagi aam janata imaaraten banaati
 On the night of every fourth day, the nobles and upper class people were given the task of breaking the secret structure and they were paid in return
 is prakaar unki izzat barkaraar rakhi gai

 jeevatma ko bhi sat swaroop, chaitanya swaroop tathaa anand swaroop sweekaar kiya he
 Stating the nature of the world, it is said that - arthath naam evam rup se vyaakrit, anek karta, anek bhokta se sanyukt, jisamen desh, kaal, nimitt or kriyafal bhi niyat hai
 The world whose creation cannot be imagined by the mind, the origin, the position and the rhythm of the world, it is called Brahm
 sampoorn jagat ke jeevon ko brahm ke rup main sweekaar karnaa, tathaa tark aadi ke dwaara uske siddh kar dena, aadi shankaracharya kii visheshta rahi he
 In this way, from the evaluation of Shankaracharya's personality and work, we can say that the task of tying the nation in a sutra was done by Shankaracharya
 bhartiya samskruti ke vistaar main bhi inkaa amuly yogadan rahaa he
 Adi Guru Shankaracharya was born in a village called Kaldi in Kerala
 vah apane brahman mata-pita kii ekmaatr santaan the
 His father died as a child
 shankar kii ruchi armbh se hi sanyas kii taraf thi
 At a young age, after requesting mother to leave for sannyas, he went out in search of Guru
 
 After receiving knowledge from Guru Gobind Paad of Vedanta, he traveled all over the country
 mithila ke pramukh vidwaan mandan mishra ko shastrarth main haraaya
 But Mandan was defeated by Mishra's wife Bharti
 dubaara phir rati vigyaan main paarangat hokar bharti ko parajeet kiya
 He removed the religious practices prevalent in the then India and illuminated the country with the light of Advaita Vedanta
 sanathan dharm kii raksha hetu unhone bharat main chaaron dishaao main chaar mathon kii sthapana kii tathaa shankaracharya pad kii sthapana karke us par apane chaar pramukh shishyon ko asin kiya
 Jyotirmath in the north, Shringeri in the south, Govardhan in the east and Sharda Math in the west established four dhams in the country
 32 saal kii alpaayu main pavitra kedaar nath dham main sharir tyaag diya
 Shankaracharya is known as Adi Guru with respect in the whole country
 ek sanyasi balak, jisaki aayu maatr 7 varsh thi, gurugrih ke niyamanusaar ek brahman ke ghar bhiksha maangane pahunchaa
 There was not even a grain of food in the house of that Brahmin to give alms
 brahman patni ne us balak ke haath par ek aanwala rakhaa or rote hue apni vipannataa kaa varnan kiya
 Seeing his condition, the heart of that love-pity idol child was moved
 vah atyant aart swar main maan lakshmi kaa stotra rachakar us param karunamayi se nirdhan brahman kii vipadaa harne kii prarthana karne laga
 Pleased at his request, Mahalakshmi rained gold amla in the house of that poor poor Brahmin
 jagat janani mahalakshmi ko prasann kar us brahman parivaar kii daridrata dur karne vaala, dakshin ke kaladi gram main janma vah balak tha- ‘'shankar'’, ji aage chalakar '‘jagadguru shankaracharya'’ ke naam se vikhyath hua
 Lord Shankar himself incarnated on this earth in the form of this great scholar Shaktipunj child
 inke pita shivguru nampudri ke yahan vivaah ke kai varshon baad tak jab koi santan nahin hui, tab unhone apni patni vishishtadevi ke saath putr prapti kii kaamana se dirghakaal tak chandramauli bhagwaan shankar kii kathor aradhana kii
 After all, Lord Shankar appeared in a dream and was pleased and said, 'ask for the groom
 ’ shivguru ne apane isht guru se ek dderghaayu sarvajna putr maanga
 Lord Shankar said- 'watts, longevity son will not be omniscient and omniscient son will not have longevity
 bolo tum kaisaa putr chaahate ho?’ tab dharmapraan shastrasevi shivguru ne sarvajna putr kii yachana kii
 Lord Shiva again said - 'watts you will get an omniscient son
 main swayan putr rup main tumhaare yahan avateern hounga
 ' kuch samay ke pashchaat i
 san 686 main baishakh shukla panchami ke din madhyakaal main vishishtadevi ne param prakashrup ati sundar, divya kaantiyukt balak ko janm diya
 Devgn Brahmins reflected the chakra symbol on the forehead of the child, the eye sign on the forehead and the insignia on the wing to represent him as a Shiva avatar and named him 'shankar'
 inhen shankaracharya ji ko prativarsh baishakh shukla panchami ko shradhanjali arpit karne ke liye shri shankaracharya jayanti manaai jaati he
 At the time when Jagadguru Shankaracharya emerged, at that time Vedic religion was melting in Bharata and humanity was dying, in such a situation, Acharya Shankar appeared as Bhaskar Prakash Pillar of human religion
 maatr 32 varsh ke jivan kaal main unhone sanathan dharm ko aisi ojasvi shakti pradaan kii ki uski samast murchha dur ho gai
 Shankaracharya had attained good knowledge of Malayalam at the age of three years
 inke pita chaahate the ki ye sanskrit kaa purna gyaan praapt karen
 But due to the premature death of the father, in the infancy, Shankar's head's shadow rose from Shankar's head and the entire burden fell on Shankar ji's mother's shoulders
 lekin unki mata ne kartavya paalan main kami nahin rakhi
 paanch varsh kii avasthaa main inkaa yagyopavit sanskaar karwaakar vedon kaa adhyayan karne ke liye gurukul bhej diya gaya
 They were rich in talent from the beginning, so their guru was also very surprised by their talent
 apratim pratibha sampann shrutidhar balak shankar ne maatr 2 varsh ke samay main veda, puraana, upanishad, ramayana, mahabharat aadi granth kanthsth kar liye
 After that, after being honored with the Guru, he returned home and started serving Mother
 unki matra shakti itani vilakshan thi ki unki prarthana par alwai nadi, jo unke gaanv se bahut dur bahati thi, apana rukh badal kar kaladi gram ke nikat bahane lagi, jisase unki mata ko nadi snaan main suvidha ho gai
 After some time, his mother thought of his marriage
 par acharya shankar gruhasthi ke jhanjhat se dur rahanaa chaahate the
 An astrologer had also told by looking at the birth chart that at a young age there is the possibility of his death
 aisa jaanakar acharya shankar ke man main sanyas lekar lok-seva kii bhaavana prabal ho gai thi
 He persevered with his mother for retirement and Bal Shankar took retirement at the age of 7
 phir jivan kaa ucchtam lakshya praapt karne ke liye mata se anumati lekar ghar se nikal pade
 One day in the life of Acharya Shankara - Acharya Shankar is versed to reach him in the last moments of Matashree Aryamba's life
 'kaalah krida gachchhatyaayuʼ siddhantanusaar yah kshan udit hota he
 Acharya Shankar gets a foreshadowing from the power of yoga
 chal dete hai ve kerala ke kaalti sthit apane gram kii ore
 As soon as the village enters the border, the storm of memories completely engulfs them
 'are, yahi to alwai nadi he
 i was caught by a crocodile while bathing in it
 matashri se mere sanyas kii anugna milne par hi usne mujhe mukt kiya tha
 There was so much compulsion in his mind while giving permission
 main unka ekmaatr santan
 He is also sanyasom oriented
 vansh shrinkhalaa ke uchhinn hone kii sthiti
 Service of Ekakini Mata- Problem of Sushruva
 phir bhi unhone mujhe sanyas kii anumati di
 'acharya arrives at the door of his house thinking all these things
 acharya kii aahat paakar grihasevika darwaja kholti he 
 Acharya reaches directly to Mother Mathaiya
 sanyasi rup main putr ko dekhakar mata ke netron se ashruvindu dhalakane lagate hai
 In this sequence, the mother's death is done
 matashri ke praan apne sanyasi putr kii utkar pratiksha main hi atake the
 Here eyes see the son, and the second moment Pran gives his body the body of a body with his extraction
 acharya shankar ne sanyas kii diksha lee he, ve parivrajak ho gayi hai
 According to the scriptures, they cannot touch fire
 unke saamne ek bhayankar dharmsankat surasa kii bhaanti munh baaye khadaa ho jaataa he
 If they offer oblation to the mother goddess, then sannyasa is revered by religion
 yadi mukhaagni nahin dete to putr dharm se vimukh hote he
 For some time Acharya's ascetic mind jumped from his mind and runs away
 uske sthaan par saamaanya chitt kaa pravesh ho jaataa he
 Seeing the maternal body, he deviates like a normal human
 matashri ke haathon ko apane haath main lekar ateet main kho jate hai
 Think 'I did so much service with these hands
 aaj ye haath itane paravash ho gayi hai
 In childhood, she used to rub me in the Poorna River with these hands
 khilaate samay saathi bacchon ke saath main khilne ke liye bhaag jaataa tha
 She used to run and catch me and feed with these hands
 inhen haathon se ve pratidin menre sharir par telumardan karti thim
 When Dadashree died, Mothershree wanted to spend the rest of her life with my mind
 par menre sanyasi hone ke pashchaat ve puri tarah se tut gayin
 In my absence, he had only one task left, waiting for death
 'acharya shankar ateet se vartmaan main utarate hai
 At the same time, the housekeeper whispers in his ear, 'your Namboodri family will not participate in the funeral procession of the mother
 unke asahyog kaa kaaran yah he ki ve aapke is krity ko shaastra viruddh or parampara viruddh maanate hai
 It is said that when a sannyasi gives up his home, it is against the scripture to return to his home principal
 agni sparsh uske liye sarvatha varjit he
 We cannot support Acharya Shankar in working against such scriptures
 sevika kii baat sunakar acharya ek kshan ke liye udign ho jate hai
 They do not understand how they will go to the crematorium with the dead body of mother alone
 kuch samay ke liye ve kinkartavyavimudh ho jate hai
 Suddenly a solution flashes in his mind
 'matashri ke shav ko shmashaan ghat par na le jaakar yadi grih parisar main hi antyeshti kar di jaay to isamen kya aapatti ho sakati he
 ʼ Some such feeling comes in the mind of Acharya
 sagotri log dur se hi acharya kii dwividha kaa anand le rahe hai
 No one supports them in these moments of disaster
 antatah acharya shankar apane ghar ke saamne hi chita sajaate hai
 Somehow the body of the mother is placed on the pyre
 haath main agnishikha lekar chita kii parikrama karte hue shav ko mukhaagni dete hai
 Acharya converts the house premises into a crematorium
 chita se uthi lapaton ko dekhakar acharya ko lagata he jaise agni dev unki mata ke sookshm sharir ko lekar pitralok kii ore prayaag kar rahe hai
 Gradually the flames of the pyre calm down but the mind of the Acharya gets upset for his relatives
 sochate hai, itani baari vipattiyon me hamaare sagotriyo ne sahanubhuti kaa ek shabd bhi muh se nahin nikaala
 This mentality of Acharya Shankar leads to a curse, "now the people of this gotra will not cremate the crematorium like me, but in front of their house
 " 'mrisha na hoi dev rishi vaani' siddhanth ke anusaar kerala ke kaalti gram main namboodri brahmanon me aaj bhi shav-dah ghar ke saamne hi kiya jaataa he
 After a long trek from Kerala, he reached Omkarnath on the banks of river Narmada
 vahaan guru govindpad se yoga shiksha tathaa advait brahm gyaan praapt karne lage
 Acharya Shankar continued to practice the Advaita element for three years
 tatpashchaat guru ajna se ve kaashi vishwanath ji ke darshan ke liye nikal pade
 While he was going to Kashi, a Chandal came in his way
 unhone krodhit ho chandal ko vahaan se hat jane ke liye kaha to chandal bolaa- ‘he muni! aap shariron main rahane vaale ek paramatma kii upeksha kar rahe hai, isliye aap abrahman hai
 Therefore, move away from my path
 ’ chandal kii devvani sun acharya shankar ne ati prabhavit hokar kaha-‘aapane mujhe gyaan diya he, at: aap mere guru hue
 Saying this, when Acharya Shankar bowed down to him, he was seen by Shiva and four deities in place of Chandal
 kaashi main kuch din rahane ke dauraan ve mahishmati nagari main acharya mandan mishra se milane gaye
 The domesticated hyena that was home to Acharya Mishra also chanted Veda mantras
 mishra ji ke ghar jaakar acharya shankar ne unhen shastrarth main haraa diya
 Seeing the defeat of her husband Acharya Mishra, wife Acharya said to Shankar - 'mahatmaan! You have just won half a part
 apni yuktiyon se mujhe parajeet karke hi aap vijayi kahala sakenge
 ' tab mishra ji kii patni bharti ne kaamshaastra par prashn karne prarambh kiye
 But Acharya Shankar was a child-celibate, so where would he answer his questions related to work? On this, he asked for a few days time from Bharti Devi and entered into the body and got all the information about that subject
 iske baad acharya shankar ne bharti ko bhi shastrarth main haraa diya
 During his stay in Kashi, he defeated even more learned Pandits in a debate and became famous on the Guru's post
 anek shishyon ne unase diksha grahan kii
 After this, he started promoting religion
 vedant prachaar main sanlagn rahakar unhone anek granthon kii rachana bhi kii
 The Advaita Brahmist Acharya Shankar believed only the uninterrupted Brahman to be true and was immersed in the Brahmana
 ek baar ve brahm muhoort main apane shishyon ke saath ek ati sankri gali se snaan hetu manikarnika ghat ja rahe the
 On the way, a young woman sat mourning her dead husband's head in his lap
 acharya shankar ke shishyon ne us stri se apane pati ke shav ko hataakar rasta dene kii prarthana kii, lekin vah stri use ansuna kar rudan karti rahi
 Then Acharya himself requested him to remove the body
 unka aagrah sunakar vah stri kehane lagi- ‘he sanyasi! aap mujhase baar-baar yah shav hataane ke liye kah rahe hai
 Why don't you ask this dead body to be removed? ' Hearing this, Acharya said- 'O Goddess! You may have also forgotten in mourning that the body itself does not have the power to move away
 ’ stri ne turant uttar diya- ‘mahatman aapaki drushti main to shakti nirpeksh brahm hi jagat kaa karta he
 Then why can't this dead body be removed without power? ' Acharya sat there after hearing such a serious, knowledgeable, mysterious sentence of that woman
 unhen samadhi lag gai
 In the inner eye, he saw - everywhere Adyashakti Mahamaya Leela is mourning
 unka hriday anivarchaneey anand se bhar gaya or mukh se matra vandana kii shabdamayi dhara stotra banakar foot padi
 Now Acharya Shankar became such an ocean in which streams of monotheism, monotheism, pure virtue, specific dualism, devotion to virtuous realization with Nirguna Brahman wisdom started to shake together
 unhone anubhav kiya ki gyaan kii advait bhoomi par jo paramatma nirgun niraakaar brahm he, vahi dwait kii bhoomi par sagun saakaar he
 He considered the worship of Saguna to be the inevitable ladder to reach Nirguna by supporting both Nirguna and Saguna
 gyaan or bhakthi kii milan bhoomi par yah bhi anubhav kiya ki advait gyaan hi sabhi saadhnaaon kii param uplabdhi he
 He also proclaimed 'brahman Satyam Jaganmithya' and also composed devotional hymns of Shiva, Parvati, Ganesh, Vishnu etc
, composed the best texts like 'soundarya Lahiri', 'vivek Chudamani'
 prasthaan trayee ke bhashya bhi likhe
 With his irrefutable arguments ended the duality of shaiva-shakta-vaishnavas and paved the way for Panchdevopasana
 unhone asetu himalay sampurna bharat kii yatra kii or chaar mathon kii sthapana karke puure desh ko saanskrithik, dharmik, darshanik, aadhyatmik tathaa bhugolic ekta ke avichhinn sutara main band diya
 He gave a formula of liberation to all mankind - arthath durjan sajjan bane, sajjan shanti bane
 Be free from peaceful bonds and free other people
 apana prayojan puraa hone baad taintis varsh kii alpaayu main unhone is nashwar deh ko chhod diya
 Shankaracharya was a great ordinationist
 unhen hindu dharm ko punah sthapit evam pratishthit karne kaa shrey diya jaataa he
 On the one hand he reinforced the philosophical basis of Sanatan Hinduism by reviving Advaita thinking, on the other hand he also tried to justify the idolatry prevalent in the masses
 sanathan hindu dharm ko drudh aadhaar pradaan karne ke liye unhone virdohi panth ke mat ko bhi aanshik taur par angikaar kiya
 Mahayana Buddhist thought is believed to have an influence on Shankar's Mayanism

 The first is Saguna Brahma but the second is Nirguna Brahm

 Thousands of its friends are prevalent around the world
 isaki mukhya charitra durbhagyapurna paristhitiyon main rahati ek yuva ladki he, jisaki kismat kaa sitara achaanak badal jaataa he
 The term "cinderella" refers to a person whose characteristics are worthless or who, after spending a period of grief and neglectful life, unexpectedly acquires recognition or success
 sindrella kii yah lokapriy kahani abhi bhi antarrashtriya str par lokapriy samskritiyon ko prabhavit karti he or vibhinn prakaar kii media ko kathanak ke tatv, prasang, sanket aadi udhaar detii he
 The theme of Cinderella will probably stem from classical antiquity
 The Greek historian Strabo mentioned the story of the first-century BC greco-egyptian girl Rhodopis "rosie Eyes", who lived in the Greek colony of Nokratis, located in ancient Egypt
 ise aam taur par is kahani kaa pracheenatam sanskaran mana jaataa he: Nearly five centuries before Strabo, Herodotus provided further information about Rhodopis in his history, stating that Rhodopis came from Thrace and was a friend of the Kemis of Ledmon of Samos and the Knees of Aesop
 use firo amasis ke samay misr le jaaya gaya or mitilen ke geetkaar safo ke bhai charaxs se ek badi raashi ke evaj main mukt kar diya gaya
 This story later appeared in Alien, which proved that the theme of Cinderella remained as popular throughout ancient times
 sindrella kii kahani main kaddu kaa jaadooi mahatv, jise aadhunik sandarbh main kisi aise vyakti dwaara jo jaldi hi so janaa chahta ho 'main aadhi raat ke baad ghode bech kar sota hum' jaise sandarbh ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he, sambhawatah pehali shatabdi main seneka kii hasya kriti 'on da pumpkiniphication of clodius' se aayaa tha
 In this, the use of Yamak is shown in the words used for the cultivation and for pumpkin

 jab waapas lautne kii hadabadi main vah apane ek pair kii chappal kho baithti he to raja use dhund nikaalata he or use dil de baithta he
 The medieval One Thousand and One Nights, also known as the Arabian Nights, have many pieces of this story
 isamen "da second shaikh'za story", "da eldest ladi'za tail" evam "abdulla ebn fadil and hiz bros" aadi kahaniyaan shaamil hai
 All these stories describe a younger sister being tortured by two jealous older siblings
 inamen se kuch kahaniyon main keval bahanen hai jabaki kuch anya main bhai bhi hai
 One of these stories, "judar and His Braintheran", shows a tragic end, giving the story a new twist, beyond the traditional happy ending of its predecessors, in which all the older brothers are killed by poisoning the younger brother
 sabase praarambhik europea kahani "laa gatta senerentola" yaa "da hiyarth cat" he, jo 1635 main italvi lokkatha sangrahakaar giambatista besil kii pustak II pentameron main dikhti he
 This edition formed the basis of later editions by the French writer Charles Perrault and the German Brothers Grimm
 sindrella ke sabase lokapriy sanskarnon main se ek 1697 main charles perult dwaara likhaa gaya tha
 The reason for the popularity of this story was to add things like pumpkin, fairy mother and glass slippers to the story
 ek vyapak dharna he ki sindrella ne far ke juute pahane the or jab kahani kaa angreji anuwaad kiya gaya to bhulvash ware ko vere samaj liya gaya or is tarah kaanch ke chappal kii avadharana bani or tab se ab tak kahani kaa vahi rup barkaraar he
 Another noted version was recorded in the 19th century by the brothers Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm
 The name of this story is "eschenputtel" and is helped not by a fairy mother but by a boon tree growing on her mother's tomb
 is sanskaran main sauteli bahanen shahzaade ko chakma dene ke liye apane pairon ke hisson ko katati hai, taaki unamem vah chappal feet baith sake
 shahzaade ko do kabutar aagaah kar dete hai or vah un sauteli bahanon kii aankh nikaal letaa he, jisase unki taqadir main taumr dar-dar andhon kii tarah bheekh maangane ke alaava koi rasta nahin bachataa
 is kahani main shahzaade ko do baar dhokhaa diya jaataa he lekin ve pakshi use bachaa lete hai
 This reduces Shehzade's status and makes her seem less heroic, which increases Cinderella's status as a determined person
 scottish keltic myth / katha main gil, don or krithine kii ek kahani milti he
 In Celtic the synonyms of the step sisters are Geel and Don and Cinderella is Krithinech
 ek vidhur tha jisane ek ghamandi or nakchadhi aurat se duusari shaadi kii
 uski do betiyaan thi or ve bhi maa kii tarah hi gai-guzari thim
 From his first wife, the man had a beautiful young daughter who had no match for goodness and soft temper
 sauteli maa or uski betiyaan pehali beti se jabaran ghar ke saare kaam karwaati thi
 When the girl finished her work, she would sit on the ashes
 For this reason she was named "cinderella"
 The poor girl endured all this with great patience but could not muster the courage to say all this to her father
 He was completely in possession of his wife and on doing so he used to scold him instead
 ek din shahzaade ne us jagah kii sabhi jawan ladakiyon ko nrity ke liye aamantrit kiya taaki vah unamem se apni patni chun sake
 donon sauteli bahanon ko bhi nyotaa mila tha or unhone bade utsaah se apane kapadon kii yojana banaayi
 haalanki sindrella ne unki madad kii or nrity main jane kaa khwaab bhi dekha, lekin unhone use yah kahkar taana diya ki ek naukaraani haragiz nrity main nahin ja sakati
 When the sisters went out to dance, Cinderella wept in frustration
 Her fairy mother magically appeared and vowed to help Cinderella join the dance
 He transformed pumpkin into a cart, mice into horses, a rat into a coachman and lizards into slaves
 She transformed Cinderella's ripped, vintage clothing into a beautiful gown and dressed her perfectly in a delicate pair of glass slippers
 Dharmamata asked him to enjoy the dance to the fullest, but instructed that he should return before midnight as the magic would cease after that
 jashn main har koi sindrella se mantra-mugdh ho gaya, khaas taur par shahzada jisane uskaa saath ek pal ke liye bhi nahin choda
 apni bahanon se aankh bachaakar sindrella madhya raatri se pehle ghar laut ai
 ghar aakar sindrella ne bade adab se apni dharmamata kaa shukriya adaa kiya
 He then received his half-sisters, who were enthusiastically talking about the beautiful girl they had just celebrated
 jab agali shaam ek or jashn yojit kiya gaya, to sindrella ne dharmamata kii madad se phir usamen hissaa liya
 This time Shahzada became more fascinated than before
 However, this time she did not care for the time and she was able to leave at the sound of the last hour of midnight
 In this chaos, she left one of her pair of glass slippers on the stairs of the palace
 Shehzade followed her but the security personnel stationed outside the palace saw only a simple girl go
 shahzaade ne chappal ko apane paas rakhaa or uski malkin ko dhund nikaalane or usase shaadi karne kii kasam khai
 is bich sindrella ne duusari chappal ko apane paas sahej kar rakhaa jo jaadu kaa asar khatm hone par bhi gaayab nahin hua tha
 Shehzade tried that sandal at the feet of every girl in her empire
 When Shehzada reached Cinderella's house, the half-sisters tried in vain
 When Cinderella expressed her desire to try, the half sisters taunted her
 Apparently the sandal sat right on her feet and Cinderella also showed another pair for the correct measurement
 The step sisters begged for forgiveness and Cinderella forgave them for their cruelty
 sindrella mahal lauti or vahaan usne shahzaade se shaadi rachaai
 sauteli bahanon ne bhi do adhipatiyon se shaadi kar lee
 The lesson of this story is that beauty is a treasure but kindness is priceless
 iske bina kuch bhi sambhav nahin; iske saath har baadha paar kii ja sakati he
 Cinderella is classified as arne-thompson Type 510A, Upekshita heroine
 is prakaar kii anya kahaniyon main da sharp grey sheep, da golden sleeper, da story of tam and kem, rashen koti, fere, brown and trembling evam keti woodenclock shaamil hai
 The story of "cinderella" has formed the basis of many notable works: opera The ballet aais sho poem mookabhinay1904 main landan ke drury len theatre or 1905 main edelfi theatre ke manch par sindrella kii shuruyaat ek mookabhinay ke rup main hui
 inamen se duusare main 14 yaa 15 varshiya filis daire ne abhinay kiya tha
 The opening scene in the traditional pantomime version is of a jungle hunting and it is here that Cinderella first meets Shehzade and her main assistant Dendini, whose name and character were taken from the Gioacchino Rossini Opera
 sindrella dendini ko shahzada or shahzaade ko dendini samajhane kii bhul kar baithti he
 Her father Baron Hardop is under pressure from both of her ugly stepdaughters, beautiful sisters, and has a servant named Buttons who is a friend of Cinderella
 puure mookabhinay main baron ko lagaataar dalal ke aadmi bakaayaa kiraye ke liye pareshaan karte rahete hai 
 pari dharmamata jashn main jane ke liye jaadu se sindrella ke liye ek gaadi, ghulaam, ek kochavaan or ek khubasurat kapade banaati he
 However, he has to come back by midnight as the magic ends after that
