 fiqh islamic dharamshastra ko kaha jaataa he
 Fiqh has its impact on every aspect of Islamic life for Muslims
 jabaki shariat us samucchy niti ko kehete hai
 Which is based on Islamic legal, traditions and Islamic personal and ethical practices
 fiqh islamic nyaayashastra ke liye shabdaawalee he, jo islamic nyayavidon ke faislon se bana he
 The basic component of Islamic studies, Fiqh elaborates on the method by which Islamic law has been drawn out of primary and secondary sources
 islamic nyaayashastra kaa itihaas "prathanusaar aath avadhiyon main vibhajit" kiya gaya he
 The sources of Fiqh in order of importance are: koran kai muddon par spasht nirdesh detaa he jaise ki anivaary dainik prarthana se pehle shuddhikaran anushthan kaise karen, lekin anya muddon par, kuch musalamaanon kaa maananaa hai ki akele koran hi chijen spasht karne ke liye paryaapt nahin hai
 For example, according to the Qur'an — during the month of Ramadan, one needs to engage in daily prayers and fasting but Muslims believe they need more instruction on how to perform these duties
 in muddon ke bare main spashtikaran paighmbar mohammad kii paramparaon main paaya ja saktaa he, isliye adhikansh maamalon main daleelein koran or sunnat kaa aadhaar hai
 Some subjects in the early period of Islam are without precedent
 In those cases, Muslim jurists try to come to conclusions in other ways
 sunni nyayavid samudaay kii aitihaasik sahmati kaa prayog karte hai; aadhunik yug main adhikansh nyayavid bhi saadrishy or nae vishyon ke nafaa or nuqasaan kii tulana kaa upyog karte hai
 With the help of these additional tools, a wide array of laws are formed according to Sharia and this is called Fiqh
 is prakaar, sharia ke saamne, fiqh ko pavitra nahin mana jaataa he, or 'vichaar-prakriya ke vidyalayon' ke tafasilaat par anya nishkarshon ko pavitraapurna rup main bina dekhe hi asmaan vichaar hai
 This division of interpretation into more elaborate issues has resulted in different schools of thought process
 This broad concept of Islamic jurisprudence is the source of many laws in various disciplines that direct Muslims in everyday life
 shariat kii niti ko neenv bana kar nyaayashastra ke adhyyan ko fiqh yaa fiqah kehete hai
 Due to different interpretations of Islamic scholars in the case of Fiqh, jurisprudence in Islam got divided in many parts and many different jurisprudence related doctrines were born
 inhen mazahab kehete hai
 The main denominations in Sunni Islam are: adhiktam musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki chaaron mazahab buniyadi taur par sahi hai or inamen jo matbhed hai vah nyaayashastra kii baarik vyakhyaaon ko lekar he

 Weapons can be used to attack, defend or intimidate
 shastr ek taraf lathi jitna saral ho saktaa he to duusari taraf belistic prakshepastra jitna jatil bhi
 Armaments are those instruments used in warfare
 is prakaar tir, talwaar se lekar badi-badi topon tak sabhi yantra aayudh hai
 The history of the development of armaments is as old as the development of mankind

 He would have had to fight terrible and powerful creatures to save life
 manushya ke paas na to un jeevajantuon ke baraabar bal tha, na utana motaa or kathor charm or na teevr tathaa ghaatak daant tathaa nakh hi the
 Man must have invented the first weapons with his experiences and intelligence
 ende yaa lathi kaa vikaas barchaa, gada, talwaar, ballab or aadhunik sangeen main hua
 Similarly, simple stone throwing was developed in spear, bow-arrow or archery, catapult, ball, bullet and modern nuclear bomb
 ayudhon ke vikaas or badhati shakti ke saath-saath pratiraksha ke upkarnon kii aavashyaktaa hui or unka avishkaar hua
 Probably the art of making shields by trapping leather in wooden poles will be very old
 kalantar main kavach or aadhunik yug main aakar kavachayaan kaa avishkaar hua
 It has been seen that whenever humans created the means of destruction, along with that, the means of defense also developed
 ayudhon kaa vargeekaran saadhaarant: unke prayog, vidhi ore visheshtaon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 According to them, the classification of weapons from stone age to the invention of gunpowder is as follows: shastr ve hathiyaar he jo phenke nahin jate
 The following weapons are under their subclassification: kaatanevaale shastr; jaise talwaar, parashu aadi; Barking weapons, such as barkha, trident, etc
; kund shastr, jaise gada
 Weapons are weapons that are thrown
 inke antargat ye astr hai : According to archaeologists, the knowledge of man increased with time and he thoughtfully started making stones and wooden weapons at will
 phir inhen shastron ko ghiskar sapaat, sudaul, teevr or chamkila bananaa aarambh kiya
 The main weapons of this period were stone axes, mace and knives
 sahasron varsh baad usne dhanush or bhaale kaa bhi nirmaan kiya
 Around 4,000 years BC By the time man had found the address of the metal
 taanbe or raange ko milakar usne kaansa bananaa janaa ore tab dhire-dhire pathar ke shastron kaa sthaan kaanse ke shastron ne le liya
 Weapons of this period, especially of the bow, arrow, spear, knife, spear, ax and mace, and only the shield of bronze are found in defensive tools
 kaanse kaa sthaan praaia: 1000 i
pus
 main lohe ne liya
 In the Vedic period the classification of astrasastras was as follows: amukta - ve shastr jo phenke nahin jate the
 Mukta - The weapons that were thrown
 inke bhi do prakaar the- muktam-mukt - The weapon used both by throwing or throwing
 muktsannivritti - ve shastr jo phenkakar lautaae ja sakate the
 Firearms are also mentioned, but not more clearly
 shastron kaa vargeekaran kai tarah se kar sakate hai
 Some scholars have given the following 3 characteristics of weapons - prasiddh sainya vichaarak je epa si fuller ne hathiyaaron main nimnlikhit visheshtaon kaa hona anivaary bataaya he- In addition to the above qualities, it is also necessary to have the following qualities in the best weapons - sharir ke vibhinn angon kii raksha kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 For example, leather and armor for the body, head for head and neck for neck etc
 europe main bhi isi prakaar ke shastr banate the
 The 12th-century armor was made by kneading small pieces of iron
 jirahabakhtar sundar or suvidhajanak avashya tha, par baari shastron kii chot se purnataya raksha nahin kar saktaa tha
 Hence from the 13th century AD, iron sheet coverings were made in Europe and they were worn over the mesh
 yoddha ab sir se paanv tak pattakvach se dhakaa rahata tha
 The joints in these armors were maintained for easy movement of body components
 peeche ashv ke liye bhi liye bhi aisa hi kavach banane laga
 The trap was also made for both horse and man
 savaar or ashv ke kavach kaa bhaar 200 se 300 pound tak hota tha
 The power of weapons also increased in the 13th century
 angrejon kaa lanbaa dhanush itnaa shaktishaalee hota tha ki usase chalaaya baan saadhaaran kavchon ko bhed detaa tha
 This bow was six feet long and its six foot arrow could shoot up to 250 yards easily
 isi prakaar switzaraland kaa 'hellbird kulhada' tha
 Its shaft was eight feet and along with the ax, it also had a serpentine fork to pull the spear and rider into it
 daksh ladaaka isaki chot se achche kavach ko bhi kaat saktaa tha
 The invention of gunpowder gave such power in the hands of man that changed the design of war
 yah nishchit he ki 14veen shatabdi ke aarambh main aagneyastra ban chuke the
 The first firearms were cannons
 yah mukhyat: do prakaar kii banaai gai - ek choti nalwali or duusari lambii naliwali 
 These cannons were first made of copper and bronze and then made of iron
 15veen shatabdi main topein 30 inch paridhi kii hoti thim or 1,200 se 1,500 pound bhaar ke pathar ke gole chalaati thim
 Modern howitzers and heavy fieldguns are developed forms of mortar and bombard
 isi shatabdi ke ant tak choti haath kii topein baniin
 They were replaced by hand guns in the early 15th century
 isi kaa vikaas dhire-dhire musket, machalock, flintlock or aadhunik rifl main hua
 The efforts of making rapid-firing guns and the use of this connection started from the 16th century and this led to the first successful machine gun in 1884
 aaj kii mashinagan ek minute main kai sau goliyaan tak chalaa sakati he
 Other important weapons were also invented in the 14th to 16th centuries, such as hand bombs, bronze explosive shells, pistols, dahk shells, etc
 shastron kaa adhik vikaas aadhunik kaal main hua
 By the 16th century, firearms had become so influential that man's defensive armor was in vain
 san 1915 kaa manushya aagneyastra ke saamne asahaay rahaa, parantu isi varsh pratham kavachayaan kaa nirmaan hua
 Man could now escape from the attack of light firearms by sitting in this car made of thick sheets of steel
 bandook, rifl or topon ke kaarykaran kaa siddhant ek hi he
 The gunpowder is kept in a strongly closed vessel on three sides and after that the vessel is temporarily sealed from the fourth side by placing a pellet, bullet or shot
 phir barood main kisi yukti se aag laga di jaati he
 The gunpowder is immediately burnt and converted into gases
 atyant kam sthaan main utpann hone ke kaaran ye gaisen bahut sampidit rahati hai
 Therefore, they press the pellets, pellets or shells very forcefully
 gola jab tak yantra ke naal main chalata rahata he tab tak usapar daab padati rahati he or uskaa veg badhata rahata he
 Thus a lot of velocity is produced in it
 naal ke kaaran uski disha bhi nirdhaarit ho jaati he; isliye naal ko ghuma firaakar gole ko icchaanusaar lakshya par maaraa ja saktaa he
 There is definite evidence of the use of cannon in Europe from 1313 AD
 bharat main babar ne panipat kii ladaai main topon kaa pehle-pehle prayog kiya
 The first cannons were made of bronze and were molded
 parantu aisi topein paryaapt pusht nahin hoti thim
 They used to burst by putting more ammo in them
 is dosha ko dur karne ke liye unke upar lohe ke challe tapt karke khub kasakar chadha die jate the
 When frost, such rings shrink and hold the inner cord very firmly, just as the wheel mounted on top of the bullock cart is pressed
 adhik pushtataa ke liye challe chadhaane ke pehle naal par lambaai ke anudish bhi lohe kii chaden ek duusari se sataakar rakh di jaati thim
 a famous cannon of the time is Mons Meg, which is now placed on the fortress of Edinburgh to adorn
 iske baad lagbhag 200 varshon tak top banane main koi vishesh unnati nahin hui
 In this era, the cluster of drains was smooth
 parantu lagbhag san 1520 main germany ke ek top banaanevaale ne sanchhidr main sarpilaakaar khaanche bananaa aarambh kiya
 This cannon consisted of longitudinal "shells" instead of circular shells
 sanchhidr main sarpilaakaar khaanchon ke kaaran prakshipt pind veg se naachne lagata he
 Thus the dancing object deviates much less from resistance to air and consequently falls more truthfully at the target
 1855 i
 main lard armastrang ne pitwaan lohe kii top kaa nirmaan kiya, jisamen pehle kii topon kii tarah munh kii ore se barood aadi bhari jane ke badale peeche kii ore se dhakkan hataakar yah sab saamagree bhari jaati thi
 40 pounds of it were filled in it
 saadhaaran topon main prakshipt bade veg se nikalataa he or top kii naal ko bahut unchi disha main nahin laayaa ja saktaa he
 On the other hand, small cannon guns are light and there is not much velocity in the projectile coming out of them, but they have the quality that the projectile falls very high up and down and hence it can kill the enemy hiding behind the wall, hill etc
 inhen morter kehete hai
 a cannon of mid-size is called a howitzer
 jaise-jaise topon ke banane main unnati hui vaise-vaise mortaron or houvitzron ke banane main bhi unnati hui
 In almost all countries, there was an advance in the manufacture of guns in the same way, because there was equal competition
 jab koi ek desh aadhik baari, adhik shaktishaalee yaa adhik furti se gola daagnevaali top banaata to baat bahut dinon tak chhipi na rahati or pratidwandvi deshon kii cheshtaa hoti ki usase bhi acchhee top banaai jaay
 In 1898, the French made a cannon that was to guide the guns that were made after that
 usase nikle prakshipt kaa veg adhik tha; uskaa aropan saraahneey tha; daagne par purnataya sthir rahata tha, kyonki aropan main aise daine lage the jo bhoomi main dhansakar top ko kisi dish main hilne na dete the
 All cannons retreat when fired
 is dhakke ke veg ko ghataane ke liye dravon kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 Its projections were made of thin walls
 inamen se prayek kii tol lagbhag 12 pound thi or usamen lagbhag saadhe teen pound ucch visphoti barood rahati thi
 There was also a cap containing special chemicals in the projectile, which caused the projectile to explode upon reaching the target and the pieces used to injure the enemy far and wide
 yah diwaar ke peeche chhipe sainikon ko bhi maar sakati he
 In the First World War, the Germans built a cannon called 'big Bertha', from which they started shelling 75 miles from Paris
 is top main koi nayaa siddhant nahin tha
 The cannon was only sufficiently large and athletic
 parantu hawaii jahaajon tathaa anya naveen yantron ke avishkaar se aisi topein ab luptpraaya ho gai hai
 The fireballs follow the same principle on which the ammunition arrows left on Deepawali
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke antim varsh main agnibaan bahut kaaryakari siddh hue
 There were 30 fireballs three-three inches in diameter and each one was filled with explosives called chordite
 prayek ke sir kaa bhaar 29 pound tha
 Each fire could go from 3,900 to 8,000 yards when fired
 prayek bijli ke switch se daaga jaataa tha
 These switches could either be arranged in such a way that the fireballs keep dropping automatically for half a second or as many fireballs or total fireballs at the same time
 ucch visphotak ke is ekaek dhamaake se shatru kii sena ko baari kshati pahunchati thi or vah atyant bhaybheet ho jaaya karti thi
 At the end of the Second World War, Germany created fireplaces with no human operator and far reaching names, named V-S and V-2
 dekhne main ve-ek vayuyan ke samaan hota tha
 It contained 130 gallons of petrol and the machine used to weigh about one ton
 udate samay iskaa veg 350 mile prati ghanta ho jaataa tha or chalane main yah bhayanak dhwani utpann karata tha
 a picture of V-2 is shown together
 isamen alcohol or drav oxygen kaa prayog hota tha
 Each arrow contained about three tons of alcohol and five tons of liquid oxygen
 iskaa mahattam veg lagbhag 3,000 mile prati ghanta tha
 The device was shaped like a cigar and about one ton without a fuel load
 vayuyan itane veg se chalate rahete hai ki unako top se maar giraanaa kathin hi hota tha, parantu amareeki vaigyanikon ne radar or vayuyanaghatak topon kaa aisa sambandh joda ki top apane aap vayuyan par sadhi rahati thi
 This was the victory over flying bombs of 1944, as these radar cannons killed about 70 percent of such bombs

 At Agra, the tomb of itmad-ud-daula completed in 1628, built entirely of white marble and covered wholly by pietra dura mosaic, is one of the most splendid examples of that class of ornamentation anywhere to be found
 Jahangir also built the Shalimar Gardens and its accompanying pavilions on the shore of Dal Lake in Kashmir
 He also built a monument to his pet antelope, Hiran Minar in Sheikhupura, Pakistan and due to his great love for the agrawal is the best in bharatpur it is made in tajmahal and originality of the style gave way under Shah Jahan to a delicate elegance and refinement of detail, illustrated in the magnificent palaces erected in his reign at Agra and Delhi, the latter one the most exquisitely beautiful in India

 The Taj Mahal, the "teardrop on eternity", was completed in 1648 by the emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal who died while giving birth to his 14th child
 The extensive use of precious and semiprecious stones as inlay and the vast quantity of white marble required nearly bankrupted the empire

 rachnawad ek adhigam siddhant he yaa shaikshik darshan he jis par anek shikshakon ne 1990 ke dashak main vichaar karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 One of the primary tenets of this philosophy is that learners construct their own meanings from new information when they interact with others of reality or different perspectives

 The aim of educational technology is to improve the situation of education without technology
 daawa kiye gayi laabhon main se kuch neeche soochibaddh hai: Although technology has many benefits in the classroom, there are also obvious drawbacks
 uchit prashikshan kii kami, ek praudyogiki kii paryaapt maatra tak simit pahunch or praudyogiki ke kai kriyanvayanon ke liye atirikt samay kii aavashyaktaa, kuch kaaran hai jinaki vajah se aksar kaksha main praudyogiki kaa bade paimaane par prayog nahin kiya jaataa he
 Similar to learning a new task or business, specialized training is important to ensure effective integration of classroom technology

 If either of these two areas is lacking, then technology will be seen as a hindrance rather than a benefit to the goals of teaching

 It has often been observed that the amount of computers or the number of digital cameras for classroom use is not sufficient to meet the needs of an entire class
 kuch kam suchit rup main aisa bhi hota he ki praudyogiki kii oonchi laagat or kharaab hone ke dar se praudyogiki anusandhan ke liye simit pahunch hoti he
 In other cases, the inconvenience of resource placement such as transporting a class to a computer lab by transport rather than facilitating computer access to a classroom via laptop is an obstacle

 Another major issue arises due to the developing nature of technology

 After such changes it is often difficult to obtain quality materials to support classroom objectives, even after their adequate availability, teachers have to design these resources accordingly

 The specimen was taken to the British Museum in London and was named Eucliptus obliqua by the French botanist l'héritier, who was then working in London
 They invented the word by adding the Greek words eu and calyptos, meaning "well" and "covered"
 This is in the context of the capillary operculum above it to protect the bud, which opens at the pressure of the stamens at the time of flowering
 yah bahut sambhav ek durghatana jaisi hi thi ki el'herrytear ne sabhi yucalyptus ke liye ek aam naam chunaa

 By now, the sprout of Sudharma's mind had taken the form of a huge tree

 After finishing the puja, she started to leave the earthly Shivalingas in the pond

 He always came and fell at the feet of Ghushma

 At the same time, Lord Shiva also appeared there and started asking Ghushma to ask for the groom

 He was looking forward to cutting his throat with his trident
 ghushma ne haath jodakar bhagavan shiv se kaha- 'prabho! yadi aap mujh par prasann hai to meri us abhaagin bahan ko kshamaa kar den
