 Mostly it is diagnosed with symptoms like abdominal pain, jaundice and vomiting, and by then it has spread to other organs like liver
 yah kaafii virala hone vaala karkat rog he or iskaa adhyayan abhi bhi ho rahaa he
 It is believed to be related to gallstones in the gall bladder, which can also lead to calcification of the gall bladder, a condition known as chimney gall bladder
 chinimitti pittashay bhi kaafii virala hone vaala rog he
 Studies suggest that chinimetic gallbladder disease is more likely to occur in people with gall bladder disease, but other studies also question this conclusion

 The initial symptoms are similar to gall bladder inflammation occurring in gallstones
 baad ke lakshan pet main atkav sambandhi va pitt nalee se sambandhit ho sakate hai
 Most tumors are adenocarcinomas and some percent are squamous cell tumors

 Diagnosis in the early stages is usually not possible

 Such reversals can be deliberately created reversals

 The said first type of reversals are symbolic where the second form is mysterious

 The correct sequence is exactly the opposite
 yatha, moksh-dharm-arth-kaam, akaash-vaayu-tej-jal-prithvi, shiv-vishnu-brahma aadi
 As a result, yogis, tantrikas and saints started saying the opposite to the world

 Windows Vista is the latest in a series of Microsoft operating systems and possibly the most revolutionary after Windows 95
 haalaanki vista oparating system ko adhik lokapriyata uske triayami graphics swaroop or vibhinn desktop onimeshan kii vajah se mili he lekin vastav main yah microsoft kii ore se jari kiya gaya ab tak kaa sabase surakshit oparating system bhi mana ja rahaa he
 It is also more efficient in terms of communication and networking than its previous operating system
 vista ke liye hindi samarthan bhi puri tarah uplabdh he or hindi language interphes pack ke madhyam se windos vista ko puri tarah hindi ke rang main ranga ja saktaa he
 Computer users have a curiosity about whether they really need to adopt Windows Vista, the new operating system released by Microsoft
 kya microsoft ke pichley oparating system windos ekspe windos 2003 or windos 2000 kii tulana main isamen aise fitures hai jinaki andekhi karnaa sambhav na ho
 Microsoft claims that Vista is more capable, simpler, faster, smooth and secure than previous Windows
 vista pichley oparating systams kii tulana main adhik teji se khulata or band hota he
 Start up and shutdown processes are completed in five to ten seconds
 haalaanki isamen vista ke apekshaakrit behatar hardware kaa bhi yogadan he lekin khud oparating system ke code main bhi iske liye vishesh prayaas kiya gaya he
 Vista's boom is also due to its new memory management technology that keeps the most used applications ready for loading in advance
 ise 'memri fech' kaha jaataa he
 The Ready Boost feature in Vista has also contributed to its speed
 ab tak windos main memri sambandhi atirikt aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye virtual memri ke rup main pejafilon kaa istemaal hota tha
 These were placed on the computer's hard disk
 lekin vista main iske liye yuasabi drive kaa istemaal karne kaa praavdhaan he jo hard discs kii tulana main bahut tej gati se kaary karti he
 Microsoft has also provided hybrid hard drive support to its new operating system, which increases computer speed by using both flash drives and traditional hard drives combined
 windos vista main sabase pehle dhyaan khinchne vaali cheez he iskaa windos airo naamak khubasurat mukhaawaran or graphic effects
 Although such Sudarshan graphics are already present on Macintosh computers, they are first exposed through 'vista' on the Windows platform
 windos vista home premium, bijness, ultimate or enterprise sanskarnon se yukt un computaron par jinamein ek acha graphics adeptor maujuud ho, airo ke mohak graphics effects kaa anand liya ja saktaa he
 This assertion has changed the core of Windows and has made it much more attractive, diversified and decent than before
 airo ke ucch gunvattta vaale graphics or drishy prabhaavon ne windos computer kaa saundarya to badhaayaa he lekin uski vajah se computer kii kaaryakshmata yaa gati main koi kami nahin aati
 Aero has two major features - Windows Flip and Windows Flip 3D
 inke madhyam se aap apane desktop ko zyada suvidhajanak rup se vyavasthit kar sakate hai
 There has been a general perception among Microsoft users about Microsoft's operating systems that they are less secure than their rival operating systems and are relatively more vulnerable to viruses, hacking, spa ware, etc
 microsoft ne vista main is baat par khaas dhyaan diya he
 Although Vista's original 'kernel' is not rewritten, its security has been strengthened this time
 pehali baat to yah ki ab is oparating system ke sabhi bhaag karnel mod main nahin chalate balki unamem se kuch chuninda hisse hi chalate hai
 Most drivers and software in Vista run in user mode and it is no longer easy to install anything in kernel mode
 iske liye sicurity certificate or administrator str ke adhikaron kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 And it would be very difficult to get administrator level privileges, especially in offices
 windos vista main saamaanya upyogkarta ke adhikaar simit hai
 It is also not that you as a normal user cannot install the software in your computer
 aisa karne ke liye unhen asthaayee taur par jaruri adhikaar praapt ho jate hai
 Microsoft has created two categories of computers for installing Vista operating system - Vista Capable PC and Vista Premium Ready
 aise sabhi computer windos vista sakasham hai jinamein kam se kam 800 megahatrj kaa procesar or 512 embi system memri uplabdh ho
 Such processors are rare now because hardly anyone is buying less than 2 ghz processor in the market
 yadi aapane pichley do ek saalon main apana computer kharida he to uskaa procesar kam se kam itani kshamta kaa avashya hoga
 It may be a matter of system memory that your traditional computer may have 128 MB or 256 MB memory

 is transformar kii puri vinding ke prayek turn main samaan voltage hota he, chaahe vah turn primary main ho yaa secondari main
 In autotransformer, some current from the primary moves the load directly
 v 1 v 2 = n 1 n 2 = a { \ displaystyle { \ frac {V_{1}}{V_{2}}}={ \ frac {n_{1}}{n_{2}}}=a} The ampere-turns provided by the upper half: f u = i 1 = n 1 i 1 { \ displaystyle F_{U}=I_{1}=N_{1}I_{1}} The ampere-turns provided by the lower half: f l = n 2 = n 1 a { \ displaystyle F_{L}=N_{2}={ \ frac {n_{1}}{a}}} For ampere-turn balance, FU = FL: n 1 i 1 = n 1 a { \ displaystyle N_{1}I_{1}={ \ frac {n_{1}}{a}}} Therefore: i 1 i 2 = 1 a { \ displaystyle { \ frac {I_{1}}{I_{2}}}={ \ frac {1}{a}}} The size of an autotransformer is smaller than a two-way transformer of the same size

 On 25 June 1954, the Chinese Prime Minister, Mr
 Chou En Lai, paid a state visit to India, and in the joint communiqué published at the end of his visit, it was announced that he would follow the five principles of Panchsheel
 donon pradhan mantriyon ne antarrashtriya vyavhaar or sashastitv ke aavashyak siddhanton ke rup main panchasheel ke siddhanton kii vyapak ghoshnaa evam manyata kii
 Then the invasion of India by China in 1962 greatly hurt the original spirit of this treaty
 22 sitambar 1954 ko indonesia ke pradhan mantri doctor ali shastromid jojo jab bharat kii rajkeey yatra par aae to unhone swaagat bhaashan main bataaya ki indonesia kii mul reeti niti paanch siddhanton ke aadhaar par he or unhen panjyasila kehete hai
 Its principles are- janata ko pramukhataa maanavvaad ishwar main vishwaas tathaa dharmik swatantraaa hindeshia kii rashtriya ekta rashtriya samruddhi
 In this welcome event speech, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, while referring to the indo-china Agreement on Tibet, declared that in reality these five principles can become the cornerstone of world peace and cooperation

 Some expressions of these rules have become the Panchsutri basis of international political conduct in other form and shape
 disambar 1954 main yugoslavia ke raashtrapati marshall tito jab bharat kii rajkeey yatra par aae to unhone bhi panchasheel tathaa sashastitv ke mahatv par prakaash daalaa
 In the joint communiqué published by Marshal Tito and Shri Nehru on 23 December, only five principles of Panchsheel were recognized as the basis of friendship and cooperation between the two countries
 isamen kaha gaya ki ek duusare kii prabhusatta tathaa swatantraaa, anakraman, samanta, parasparahit or ek duusare desh dwaara bhitari maamalon main ahastkshep kii niti hi bharat yugoslavia kii maitri tathaa sahyog sambandh kaa aadhaar rahegi
 Similarly, in the joint communiqué published on 23 June 1955, at the end of the state visit of the Prime Minister of India to the Soviet Union, the principles of Panchsheel were accepted as the basic basis of friendship between the two countries
 panchasheel ke paanch siddhanton kaa ullekh karte hue kaha gaya he ki in siddhanton ko baraabar manyata praapt ho rahi he or inkaa vyapak prayog sambhav he
 In order to reduce tension, doubt, fear and bitterness in the world, it is very important to establish mutual relations based on these principles
 25 june 1955 ko bharat tathaa poland ke pradhan mantriyon kii sanyukt vijyapti main bhi inhen paanch siddhanton par bal diya gaya he
 In December 1955, at the invitation of the Government of India, the Prime Minister of Russia, Mr
 Bulganin and Mr
 Krushchev visited India

 Panchasheel's principles were initially accepted by India, China, India, Burma, Vietnam, Yugoslavia
 baantung sammelan main lanka, thailand, philipiens, pakistan, turki ke atirikt asia africa ke choubees rashtron ne ise manyata di
 In 1964, the Conference of Neutral Nations was held in Cairo, the capital of the United Arab Republic, Prime Minister of India, Mr
 Lal Bahadur Shastri effectively presented the principles of coexistence and Panchsheel and these principles were recognized in the Conference
 janvari, 1966 main bharat or pakistan ke bich jo aitihaasik taashkand samjhauta hua he, usamen matbhed evam vivaadon ko hal karne ke liye shastr kaa prayog na karne, ek duusare ke aantarik maamalon main hastkshep na karne tathaa sahyog, sadbhaav badhaane ke praytn ke jo siddhant maanya hue hai, ve panchasheel ke hi pramukh siddhant hai
 In this way, Panchsheel is not only the mainstay of India's transnationalism, but has also become a major motivator for world peace, international harmony and cooperation

 Typography was a special type of business until the advent of the digital age

 The choice of font is the first stage of typography lessons - story written in prose, writing separate from the story, editorial, academic, religious, scientific, spiritual and professional writing
 The right typeface and font all have their own special characteristics and needs

 Contemporary books are probably set with state-of-the-art serif "text roman" or "book roman" and their design values are indicative of present-day design art that Nicholas Jansen, Francesco Griffo and Clouds are based to a large extent on traditional models such as Garamond

 Typography is corrected by morphology and linguistics, word structure, word frequency, morphology, phonetic composition and linguistic syntax
 typography ek vishisht saanskrithik chalan ke saath bhi judaa hua he
 For example, it is customary to give a non-breaking space before a punctuation or semicolon in a French sentence, whereas in English it is not

 The text layout, tone or color of the set matter, and the text's interaction with the page's white space and other graphic elements reflect the "feel" and "resonance" of the content
 print media ke saath hi typographer binding margin, kaagaj ke chunaav tathaa mudran kii vidhi ke saath bhi jude rahete hai
 Likability is the case of a typeface designer to ensure that each character or glyph is clean and tidy with all other characters in the font
 Convenience is also somewhat related to the typographer choosing the typeface of the correct and clean design for intended use at the fixed size
 a well-known example of design, the brush script contains a lot of unreadable characters, since many of those characters can easily be misread if they look different from the textual context
 pathneeyata mukhya rup se typographer yaa soochna diziner se judi hui he
 This is the intended result of the entire process of its presentation to explain the textual content as clearly as possible

 One of the clearest distinctions between these two concepts was presented by Walter Tracy in his Letters of Credit
 


 'ek mudran ke do pahalu' 


 'apni prabhaavashiltaa main moulikta' 


 hai
 Because the common meaning of "readable" is "readable", there are still some people, some of whom are also commercially involved with typography, who think that "readability" is a term that refers to the effectiveness of the type and Needs debate
 lekin spashtataa or pathneeyata alag-alag hai, haalanki ye tip kii pahalu se sambandhit hai
 It is well known that these two words can help in analyzing the feature and function of type in a much narrower sense than the word readability alone
 


 typography main hamen spashtataa or aasaani se pahchaan yogya hone kii gunvattta kaa matlab samajhane ke liye


suvachyata kii paribhaasha dene kii jarurat he - isliye, udaaran ke liye, ham kah sakate hai ki puraane itelic style ke chote aakaar main lower cese h spasht nahin hota kyonki iskaa muda hua pair b kii tarah dikhaai padataa he; yaa vargeekrut vigyaapan main ek ank 3 bahut had tak 8 ke samaan he
 


 The portability of display sizes is serious, a character that causes uncertainty at 8 points will become apparent at 24 points
 dhyaan dene kii baat he ki uparyukt siddhant jaruri prakaash main upyukt reeding duuri par 20 / 20 drushti vaale logon ke saath lagu hota he
 The similarity of an optician chart to test for freedom of meaning and visual acuity is useful to indicate the scope of the concept of clarity
 'typography main 


 agar ek akhbaar yaa patrika yaa ek kitaab ke pannon ke stambhon ko tanaav yaa kathinaayee ke bina kai minuton tak padhaa ja saktaa he, to ham kah sakate hai ki tip kii pathneeyata acchhee he
 This indicates the quality of visual comfort - this is an important requirement in the long detailed understanding of the text, but on the contrary, it is not as important for things like telephone directories or airplane time schedules, where the reader can see it consistently
 Do not read, but look for information about a small thing
 drishy prabhaav ke donon pahaluon main antar text setting ke liye sans-cerriff kii upyuktata ke ek parichit tark dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Characters of a typical sans-serif face can make complete sense among themselves, but no one can think of setting a famous novel as it has little readability
 suvachyata 'pratyaksh gyaan se sambandhit he' or pathneeyata 'samaj ko darshata he'
 typographer kaa uddeshy donon main utkrushtataa praapt karnaa hota he
 "the chosen typeface must be clear
 Meaning, it must be read without effort
 Sometimes clarity is just a matter of type size
 lekin bahut had tak aksar, yah tiperphes dizin kaa maamla he
 Generally, typefaces that are close to basic letterfarms are more pronounced than typefaces that are dense, diffuse, compacted, or detached
 haalanki, ek spasht tiperphes bhi kamjor setting or kram sthaan ke chalate apthaneey ho saktaa he, thik usee tarah spasht tiperphes achche dizin ke dwaara adhik pathneey banaae ja sakate hai
 Studies of both clarity and readability have examined a large range of other elements, including type size and design
 udhaaharan ke liye, cerriff banaam sans cerriff tip, itelic tip banaam roman tip, line lenth, line spacing, color contrast, daayen kinare kaa dizin banaam daayan vistaar kii tulana karnaa, tathaa yah ki kya text haifan yukt he
 Allegorical research was published in the later days of the nineteenth century
 yadhyapi vahaan aksar samanthaayen or kai vishyon par sahmati he, lekin duusare aksar sangharsh or raay kii vibhinnata ke maarmik kshetron ko saamne laate hai
 For example, according to Alex Pool, no one has given a final answer as to which font, serifed or sans serif provides the most clarity
 anya vishyon jaise justifoid banaam anjustifoid, haifan kaa prayog, padhane main kathinaayee mahasoos karne vaale logon ke liye upyukt phant jaise ki dislexia par vivaad jari he
 Web sites such as hgredbes
com, Bain Comic Sans, Britain's National Literacy Trust, and Mark Simonson Studios have raised controversies on the above topics and many more, and many of them present a thorough and well-organized position
 spashtataa ko aamtaur par padhane kii gati ke madhyam se or prabhaavashiltaa kii jaanch ke liye samaj ke str ke saath, mapa jaataa he
 For example, Miles Tinker, who published several studies in the 1930s to 1960s, used a fast reading test that required participants who do not use nonsensical words as a filter of effectiveness
 bryan ko evam linda rinolds ke saath professor harbart spencer kii dekharekh main royal college of art ke pathneeyata kii print unit ne is kshetra main mahatvapurn kaam kiya or yah kai kendron main ek thi jisane pathneeyata ke liye aankh ke sacadic lay ke mahatv ko bataaya - ek baar main teen shabd lene kii yogyata or aankh kii physiognami jiskaa matlab he - aankh kii thakaavat, yadi line main 3 yaa 4 se adhik secdic jamp kii jarurat padati he
 Stress and errors are found in reading more than this
 in dinon, spashtataa se jude anusandhan kathin muddon main simat gaye hai, yaa vishisht dizin samaadhaan ke pareekshan main simat gaye hai 
 kathin muddon ke udhaaharan main durbal drushti vaale logon ke liye tiperphes or haive chihnon ke liye tiperphes yaa anya sthitiyaan jahaan spashtataa ek mahatvapurn antar paidaa kar sakati he, ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Much of the legibility research literature is atheoretical - various factors were tested individually or in groups, but many tests were conducted in the absence of a reading model or visual perception
 kuch typographeron kaa maananaa he ki samgr shabd aakaar ) pathneeyata ke liye bahut mahatvapurn he or yah ki paralal lettervaij pahchaan kaa siddhant yaa to galat, kam mahatvapurn he, yaa usamen sab kuch samahit nahin he
 In terms of how people identify letters as they read, studies distinguishing Bouma identification and counterpoint recognition have supported parallel letter recognition, which has been widely accepted by cognitive psychologists
 suvachyata anusandhan ke bare main kuch saamaanya sahamat nishkarshon main nimna baaten shaamil hai: Readability also poses a risk through letter-spacing, word-spacing, or too tight or too loose lidding
 jab bahut saare vertical spes text ke linon ko alag karte hai, to ek line ko duusare se yaa pehali vaali se antar karke ise padhane main suvidhajanak banaakar isko sudhara ja saktaa he
 Poorly designed fonts and too tightly or loosely fitted fonts can also result in poor readability
 typography sabhi mudrit saamagree kaa ek tatv he
 Typical elements are used in periodical publications, particularly in newspapers and magazines, to create attractive and distinctive colors, to connect readers to publications, and in some cases to create dramatic effects

 Pidgin is not the native language of a conversational community, but a language learned as a second language

 Pidgin generally has a lower reputation than other languages
 bhashaa ke sabhi sarlikrut yaa "khandit" rup pigin nahin hai
 Each pidgin has different usage criteria that must be learned to achieve proficiency in the pidgin
 shabd pidgin ke mul ke bare main anischitata he
 The word pidgin was first printed in 1850 and many sources exist about the etymology of the word
 udahaaran ke liye: The word pidgin, which has also been previously spelled with the pigion spelling, originally used to describe Chinese pidgin English, later became popular for referring to any pidgin
 pigin kaa upyog sthaneey pigin yaa creole ke liye vishisht naam ke rup main nirdisht kii ja sakati he, jahaan vah boli jaati he
 For example, the name Tok Pisin is derived from the English word talk pidgin
 isko bolne vaale aam taur par angrezi bolte samay iskaa ullekh bas "pidgin" ke rup main karte hai
 The term jargon is also used to describe pidgin and has also been found in some pidgin names, such as Chinook Jargon
 In this context, linguists nowadays use jargon to denote a particularly underdeveloped type of pidgin; However, this usage is often rare and the term jargon often refers to specific terms of a profession
 pigin Tok Pisin jaise vyapaar kii bhashaa ke rup shuru ho sakate hai yaa ban sakate hai
 Business languages can often be advanced languages such as Swahili, Persian or English
 vyapaar kii bhashaaen "yaneey bhashaaon" kii ore abhimukh hoti hai, jabaki pigin deshi bhashaa ke rup main viksit hoti hai
 Since the Pidgin language is fundamentally the simplest form of communication, its grammar and phonetics are generally simple as far as possible and usually include: pigin ke nirmaan main aam taur par nimna kii aavashyaktaa hoti he: In addition, Keith Vuhinom suggests that three languages are needed to build a pidgin, with one clearly being more effective than the other
 aksar yah mana jaataa he ki jab pigin bolne vaale mata-pita kii ek peedi apane bacchon ko use pratham bhashaa ke rup main sikhaati he, to pigin creole bhashaa ban jaati he
 Creole then replaces a mixture of current languages to become the native language of the community
 However, not all pidgin Creole languages are made up; Pidgin can be finished before this stage
 saaliquoco magavene jaise anya vidwaan tark dete hai ki pigin or creole bhinn paristhitiyon main swatantra rup se ubhartee hai or zaruri nahin ki creole se pehle hameshaa hi pigin ho or naa hi pigin se creole viksit hoti hai
 According to Mfvane, Pidgin emerged among the trade colonies "users preserving their native dialect for day-to-day interactions"
 Meanwhile, Creole developed into colonized colonies where European-speaking, often contracted workers with lower-than-standard linguistic level, interacted extensively with non-european slaves, with some words from slaves in non-european native languages And features assimilated, resulting in a heavily graded version of the original language
 ye sevak or ghulaam, na keval ucchstareey bhashaa bolne vaale ke saath sampark kii zarurat padane par hi nahin, balki apni dainandin sthaneey boli ke rup main creole kaa upyog karne lagate hai

 saanchaa:heteropolypeptide Hemoglobin or hemoglobin is a metalloprotein transporting iron-rich oxygen found in red blood cells of vertebrates and in the tissues of some indigens
 The hemoglobin in the blood transports oxygen from the lungs or gills to the rest of the body, where it releases oxygen for the use of cells
 stanpayiyon main laal rakt koshikaon ke shushk bhaag kaa kareeb 97% or kul bhaag kaa lagbhag 35% protein se bana hota he
 The oxygen binding capacity of hemoglobin is between 1
36 and 1
37 ml O2 per gram of hemoglobin, which increases the total blood oxygen capacity by seventy times
 haemoglobin laal rakt koshikaon or unako utpann karne vaali progenitor rekhaon ke baahar bhi pai jaati he
 haemoglobin yukt anya koshikaon main sabstanshia nigra ke e9 dopaminargik neuron, macrofaij, alviyolar koshikaayen or gurdon kii mesangial koshikaayen shaamil hai
 in utakon main haemoglobin kii bhoomika oxygen ke parivahan kii jagah antioxident or louh chayapachay ke niyantrak ke rup main hoti he
 The oxygen-carrying protein hemoglobin was discovered in 1840 by Hunfield
 In 1851 Otto Funk published a series of articles in which he described the growth of hemoglobin crystals by slow evaporation of a solution from a protein solution after diluting red blood cells with the help of solutions such as pure water, alcohol, or ether
 Told in haemoglobin ke prativarti oxikaran ke bare main felics haap-sealler dwaara kuch or varshon ke baad bataaya gaya
1959 main maiks perutz ne eksre christelography dwaara haemoglobin kii anvik rachana ko nishchit kiya
 is uplabdhi ke liye unhen jon kendru ke saath 1962 kaa rasayanashastra main nobel puraskaar diya gaya
 The role of hemoglobin in blood is described by physiologist Claude Bernard
 The name hemoglobin is derived from the combination of the terms heme and globin, suggesting that each subunit of hemoglobin is a globular protein in the heme group
 Each heme group has one iron atom, which can bind an oxygen molecule through ion-induced forces
 The most common hemoglobin of mammals consists of four such subunits
 haemoglobin main adhiktar protein hota he or ye protein amino acidon kii shrinkhalaaon se bane hote hai
 ye shrinkhlaayein raikhik rup main hoti hai, jaise kisi likhe gaye vaakya main akshar hote hai yaa maala main moti lage hote hai
 sabhi proteinon main aminon acidon kii protein shrinkhalaa main amino acidon ke prakaaron main vibhinnata us protein ke rasaynic gunon or kaary ko nishchit karti he
 yahi baat haemoglobin par bhi lagu hoti he, jisamen amino acidon kii shrinkhalaa oxygen ke prati protein ke aakarshan jaise mahatvapurn kaaryon ko prabhavit kar sakati he
 The amino acid chains of globin proteins in hemoglobins differ among different species, although variations increase with the distance of development between species
 For example, the most common hemoglobin chains in humans and chimpanzees are similar, while this same chain differs from the most common amino acid chain of guerrillas by only one amino acid in the alpha and beta globin protein chains
 These differences are more in castes with less affinity
 Like proteins other than hemoglobin, differences in DNA chains between species are greater than differences in the amino acid chains they coded, as different DNA chains may point to the same amino acid
 kisi ek jati main bhi, haemoglobin ke vibhinn prakaar hameshaa maujuud hote hai, haalanki har jati main koi ek shrinkhalaa saamanytah sabase adhik pai jaati he
 haemoglobin protein kii jeenon kii vikrutiyon ke kaaran haemoglobin ke vibhinnatayukta prakaar utpann hote hai

 in sabhi rogon main raktaalpata hoti he
 Like other proteins, chains of hemoglobin's amino acids can be adaptive
 For example, recent studies have shown how deer mice living in the mountains survive the thin air found at heights with the help of their different gene types
 a researcher at the University of nebraska-lincoln found malformations in four different genes that are thought to be responsible for the differences between deer mice living in low-lying areas and mountains
 Examining wild bees captured from the mountains and lowlands, it was found that the genes of both breeds were identical, except for those that control their hemoglobin's oxygen-carrying capacity
 The genetic variation of mountain rodents gives them the ability to use oxygen much better, because it is available in small quantities at high places like mountains
 haemoglobin kaa sanshleshan ek jatil sopan shrinkhalaa main hota he
 hime bhaag kaa sanshleshan aparipakv laal rakt koshikaon ke mitocandria or cytosol main vibhinn kadamon main hota he, jabaki globin protein bhaag cytosol main rebosomon dwaara sanshleshit hote hai

 stanpayiyon main kendrak ke na hone par bhi, bachaa hua rebosomal arene haemoglobin kaa tab tak utpaadan karata he, jab tak ki rakt pravaah main pravesh karne ke baad reticulosite kaa arene samaapt nahin ho jaataa

 Hemoglobin exhibits properties of both tertiary and quartile compositions of proteins
 Most of the amino acids of hemoglobin form alpha holics that are attached to small ahalic segments
 Hydrogen bonds stabilize helical sections within this protein, causing attraction within the molecule, and each polypeptide chain is twisted into a characteristic shape
 The quaternary structure of hemoglobin is due to its four subunits located in the tetrahedral system
 adhikansh manushyon main haemoglobin anu chaar globulaar protein upikaiyon kaa ek samooh hota he
 prayek upikai ek gaiyr-protein hime samooh se kas kar judi ek protein shrinkhalaa se bani hoti he
 prayek protein shrinkhalaa ek globin fold vyavastha main aapas main jude alpha-heliks rachanaatmak khandon ke set ke rup main vyavasthit hoti he, kyonki mayoglobin jaise anya hime / globin proteinon main isi folding motiff jaisi vyavastha hoti he
 is folding pattern main ek sthaan hota he, jo hime samooh ko majbootee se pakade rakhata he
 The heme group contains an iron ion that resides in a heterocyclic ring, called porphyrin
 This porphyrin ring consists of four pyrrole molecules, which are connected in a circle to the iron ion at the center
 The iron ion, which is the location of the oxygen bond, works together with four nitrogens living in the same plane at the center of the ring
 The iron is strongly attached to the globular protein via the imidazole ring of the F8 histidine residue located below the porphyrin ring
 a sixth space can reversibly bind oxygen by a cordinate covalent bond, thus completing the octahedral group of six ligands
 Oxygen binds in an end-on bent geometry, where the oxygen atom is bound to iron and the other exits at an angle
 When oxygen is not tiedwhen the water molecule with a weak bond fills the space, a distorted octahedron is formed
 yadhyapi carbon daai oxide kaa parivahan haemoglobin dwaara hota he, yah louh-bandhak sthanon ke liye oxygen se spardhaa nahin karata, balki vastav main rachana kii protein shrinkhalaaon se judaa hota he
 The iron ion can be in the Fe2 + or Fe3 + state, but the ferrihemoglobin cannot bind oxygen
 Oxygen in the binding is temporarily and reversibly oxidized to CO, while oxygen is temporarily converted to superoxide
 In this way, iron has to be in the oxidation state to bind oxygen
 If the superoxide anion corresponding to Fe3 + is protonated, the hemoglobin iron remains oxidized and unable to bind oxygen
 In such a situation the enzyme methemoglobin reductase may eventually reactivate methemoglobin by decreasing the iron center
 vayask manushyon main sabase aam haemoglobin prakaar haemoglobin e naamak ek tatramar hota he, jisamen naan-kovalent bandhan vaale do alpha or do beta upikaiyaan hoti hai jo kramshah 141 or 146 amino acidon se bani hoti hai

 In human babies the hemoglobin molecule is made up of 2 alpha and 2 gamma chains
 As the baby grows, the gamma chains are gradually replaced by beta chains
 ye chaar polipeptid shrinkhlaayein aapas main lavan sethuon, hydrogen baandon or hydrophobic antarkriyaaon se bandhi hoti hai
 alpha or beta shrinkhalaaon ke bich do tarah ke sampark hote hai - α1β1 or α1β2
 Broadly speaking, hemoglobin can be saturated or unsaturated with oxygen molecules
 Oxyhemoglobin originates during physiological respiration when the heme portion of the protein hemoglobin in red blood cells binds to oxygen
 This process occurs in the pulmonary capillaries located near the alveoli in the lungs
 Oxygen then reaches the cells through the bloodstream where it is used for the hydrolysis of hydrolytic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in the formation of ATP
 But it is not helpful in preventing blood ph deficiency
 Respiration can reverse this situation by removing carbon dioxide, which increases the ph back

 The oxidation state of oxidized hemoglobin is difficult to determine because oxyhemoglobin is diagenetic by experimental measurements, yet low-energy electron structures in both oxygen and iron are paramagnetic
 The following are the minimum-energy types of oxygen and related iron oxidation conditions: ye sabhi sanrachanaayen diamagnetic na hokar, paramagnetic hoti hai
 is tarah, dekhe gaye diamagnetismo or ayugal electranon ko samajhane ke liye louh or oxygen ke sanyog main electrunon kaa ek asahaj vitaran hona jaruri he
 There are three possibilities for the production of diamagnetic HB-OTO: sidhi prayogic jaankaree In this way, the closest formal state of iron in HB-OTO is the oxidation +3 state, with oxygen in the -1 state
 The diatomagnetism in this structure arises from the single unpaired electrons on the superoxide being arranged in a counter-magnetogenetically manner from the single unpaired electrons on the iron, which, according to the diamagnetic oxyhemoglobin of the experiment, does not yield any total spin
 diamagnetic oxihemoglobin ke liye upar di gai teen sambhaavnaaon main se duusari kaa prayog dwaara sahi paaya janaa aashcharyapurna nahin he– singlate oxygen or charge ke bade vibhaajan donon pratikul ucch-urja dashaaen hai

 According to preliminary theories presented by bio-inorganic chemists, prospect no
 1 was correct and the oxidation condition to iron II
 Should be in This was thought to be because iron's oxidation state in the form of methemoglobin III, when superoxide is not present to "hold" the 
o2-electron, makes hemoglobin inefficient to bind the normal triplet O2 in the air
 Therefore it is assumed that when oxygen gas is bound in the lungs, iron remains in the form of Fe
 The chemistry of iron in this earlier classic model was intriguing, but the need for a diagenetic high-energy singlet oxygen was never understood
 It was argued that the bonding of the oxygen molecule to the high spin iron placed in an octahedral region of strong-field ligands
 Gives - this change in area causes the energy to be divided by an increase in the crystal area, Thereby forming iron-electron pairs to form low-spin structures, which are diamagnetic in Fe
 This forced low-spin pairing occurs on oxygen binding, but is not sufficient to explain the change in iron size
 In order to understand the small size and increased oxidation state of iron, and the weak oxygen bond, it is necessary to remove an extra electron from the iron by oxygen
 yah dhyaan main rakhana chaiye ki purna-sankhya oxikaran dasha kaa nirdhaaran ek aupchaarikavaad he, kyonki purna electron-antaran main doshahin band kramon ke liye kovalent baandon kaa hona aavashyak nahin he
 is tarah paramagnetic echbi-otu ke teenon model kuch had tak echbi-otu kii vaastavik electranik sanrachana ke liye jimmedaar ho sakate hai
 lekin Fe kii apeksha echbi-otu main louh kaa model kaa Fe hona adhik sahi lagata he
 In addition to the oxygen ligand, which cooperatively binds hemoglobin, hemoglobin ligands also contain competitive inhibitors such as carbon monoxide and allosteric ligands such as carbon dioxide
 jab oxygen louh kamplex se bandhit hoti he, to iske kaaran louh kaa parmaanu porfirine ring ke tal ke centre kii ore chalaa jaataa he

 In this way, in the tetrameric type of normal adult hemoglobin, oxygen binding is a cooperative process
 The affinity of hemoglobin binding to oxygen is increased by the oxygen saturation of the molecule - the previously bound oxygen affects the size of the binding sites for the next oxygen in such a way that they are optimized for binding
 This positive cooperative binding process is made possible by the stearic changes of the hemoglobin protein complex discussed above, that is, when a subunit protein of hemoglobin is oxygenated, a change is initiated in the whole complex, increasing the affinity for oxygen in other subunits
 is
 As a result, the oxygen binding curve of hemoglobin is Sigma, or S-shaped, while the normal curve related to the non-binding bond is hyperpolarized

 The oxygen-binding capacity of hemoglobin is reduced in the presence of carbon monoxide as both gases compete for the same binding sites on hemoglobin, with carbon monoxide binding being preferred over oxygen

 Similarly, hemoglobin also has a competitive binding affinity to sulfides including cyanide, sulfur monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and hydrogen sulfide
 All of these bind to the iron in the heme without changing its oxidation state, but block the oxygen bond, causing severe toxicity

 Carbon dioxide is located at a different binding site on hemoglobin
 Carbon dioxide easily dissolves in oxygen-free blood, which can easily remove carbon dioxide from the body after oxygen has reached the metabolic tissues
 This attraction of venous blood to carbon dioxide is called the Halden effect
 Through the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, carbon dioxide reacts with water to give carbonic acid, which is decomposed into bicarbonate and protons - is tarah ucch carbon daai oxide vaala rakt kam piech vaala hota he
 haemoglobin protaanon or carbon daai oxide ko bandhit kar saktaa he, jisase protein main parivartan ho jaataa he or oxygen mukt hoti he

 The bound oxygen is required to be released by hemoglobin, otherwise there is no point in binding it
 The sigmoidal curve of hemoglobin makes it capable of binding and release

 a different hemoglobin, called fetal hemoglobin, is found in developing babies and binds to oxygen more attractively than adult hemoglobin
 This means that the oxygen binding curve of the femoral hemoglobin is tilted to the left compared to adult hemoglobin

 a study was carried out to see the effect of hemoglobin type on the partitioning of volatile organic compounds in the breath in the blood
 In this research, benzene was used as a sample VOC for testing, as its properties are similar to many other vocs
 This study compared the effect of water solubility of Hb on the partition coagulation of vocs with the effect of other species or types of hemoglobin
 Various blood used include human hemoglobin
 Rat Hb has very little water and is in a semi-crystalline form in red blood cells, meaning it is more hydrophobic than water-soluble human blood
 Sickle cell hemoglobin is soluble in water, but it can be insoluble in water and converted to hydrophobic polymers when deoxygenated

 In the fetus - shishu main - In adults - rog utpann karne vaale prakaar - When red cells reach the end of their lives due to age or disorders, they burst, the hemoglobin molecule splits and iron is reused
 When the porphyrin ring disintegrates, its residues are normally secreted into the bile by the liver
 This process also produces one carbon monoxide molecule for every molecule of heme
 It is one of the few sources of carbon monoxide production in the human body and is responsible for the normal blood levels of carbon monoxide even in people breathing pure air
 The second main product of heme weathering is bilirubin
 If red blood cells are getting destroyed faster than normal, increased levels of this chemical can be found in the blood

 To a lesser extent, hemoglobin a is slowly combined with glucose at the valene terminal of each beta chain
 The molecule obtained is often called hba1c
 As the amount of glucose in the blood increases, the percentage of hba changing to hba1c also increases
 Diabetes patients who have high glucose levels also have higher hba1c
 The percentage of hba1c represents the average of the level of glucose in the blood over a longer period of time as the rate of hba is combined with glucose

 The composition of hemoglobins varies among different species
 Hemoglobin occurs in all living communities, but not in all organisms
 Ancient species such as bacteria, protozoa, algae and plants often contain hemoglobin with a single globin
 Many nematode insects, molluscs, and crustaceans have very large subunit molecules, which are much larger than those of vertebrates
 In particular, the chimeric hemoglobins found in mildew and Virat annelids may contain globin and other types of proteins
