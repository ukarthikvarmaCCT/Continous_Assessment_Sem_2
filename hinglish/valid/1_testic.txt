 german shefrd kutto kii ek badi nasal he jise kii alcetian ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he or iskaa janm germany main hua tha
 German Shepherd is a new breed which was developed in 1899
 yah nasal ek kamgaari kutton kii nasal he jise kii bhed bakriyon ko ikatta karne or unki raksha karne ke kaam main liya jaataa tha or aaj bhi liya jaataa he
 Today, due to his cleverness, understanding, obedience and many other reasons, he is employed in police and military all over the world
 unki aagyaakaaripan kii vajah se hi yah sabase zyada paale jaani vaali kutto kii nasal ban gayi he
 In 1800, Europe began to develop the breed of dogs according to the criteria
 kutto kii un lakshanon kaa bachaav karte hue paidaavaar karaayi gayi jo kii unako bhed bakrii kii raksha karne va jhund ko kaabo karne main madad karte the
 This happened in many communities in Germany where Ghadhero allowed selected dogs who believed in possessing superior ability to protect the herd of animals, such as goodness, strength and good smelling ability
 
 This led to the fact that dogs born with this chosen match were better at doing all these tasks but dogs born in every community were of different colors
 is alagapan ko dur karne ke liye philks sanstha kii san 1891 main sthapanaa kii gayi jiskaa kii mukhya kaam maanako pe khare utarane vaale kutto kii paidaavaar badhaana tha
 But after only three years, this institution was disbanded because there was a lot of debate on what quality of the crop should be produced
 kuch log jaha kutto ko kaam karne ke liye paidaa karwaanaa chaahate the vahi kuch kaa maananaa tha kii unako dikhne main bhi khubasurat laganaa chahie
 Even though the Films organization failed in its work, it gave the idea of increasing the new breeds by giving the chosen yield of dogs to all
 ghudsavaaro ke ek purv captain mex von steffnitz jo kii berlin pashu chikitsa mahavidhyalay ke vidhyaarthee bhi the is sanstha ke ek purv sadsy the
 He had very strong views about how dogs should be born only for the ability to work
 san 1899 main mex von steffnitz ek kutto ke pardarshan ko dekhne gaye jaha par ek kutta dikhaaya gaya jiskaa kii naam hectares linkasrahin tha
 Hector was a descendant of many dogs that had been acquired by selected yields and which Stefanitz believed that working dogs should be
 voh is baat se kaaphi khush the kii yah jaanavar kitna shaktishaalee he or isaki samajadaari or aagyaakaaripan ne bhi une itnaa prabhavit kiya kii unhone is tunrat kharid liya
 After purchasing it, he named it Horond von Graffrath and he founded the organization of the German Shepherd Dogs
 horand ko sabase pehle german shefrd kute ke rup main ghoshnaa kii gayi or wohi sanstha ke nasal prajnan panjika main sabase pehle joda gaya
 Horund soon became an essential part of the breeding program of the institution and was bred along with other female dogs that possessed special traits
 horand ke kai pillai paidaa hue par sab se kaamyaab pilla hectares von saquaban tha
 Hector was born breeding Hörand with other descendants of Beowolf, which later resulted in 84 puppies, whose mother was also a descendant of Hector
 biowolf ke vanshajo kaa bhi anya aapasi vanshajo ke saath prajnan karaayaa gaya or inhi se aaj ke german shefrd kute paidaa hue or inhi se yah sabhi vansh guno main samanta rakhte hai
 It is believed that the organization was able to fulfill all its objectives because they were a draped, non-negotiable human being and that is why they are considered the father of the German Shepherd dog
 jab yuke kennal club ne san 1919 main is nasal ke kutto ko panjikrut karnaa chaalu kiya tab 54 kutto ko panjikrut karaayaa gaya or san 1926 tak yah akda 8000 tak pahuch gaya
 The popularity of this breed spread all over the world when the soldiers who came home at the end of the first World War told everyone about these dogs
 isamen jaanwaron ke kalakaar rin tin tin or bahadur dil ne bhi yogadan diya
 The dog named Queen of Switzerland became the first dog to be registered in the United States, although the breed's lack of proper breeding led to a decline in the loppriety in 1920
 The German Shepherd's popularity once again grew when Sejar Pfaffer von Burn dog won the American Canal Club in 1937 and 1938
 baad main ditya vishwa yudgh main germany ke khilaaf aakrosh ke kaaran is nasal kii lokapriyata ko kaaphi nuksaan hua
 As time progressed, it grew back and changed until 1993 when it became the third most popular dog breed in the United States, to this day
 is nasal kaa naam von steffnitz dwaara deutascher schapherhund rakhaa gaya tha
 This means the German Shepherd dog
 The breed got its name because it was originally developed to help the Shepherd, the shepherd and protect the sheep
 us samay germany main sabhi charavaahon kii madad karne vaale kutto ko german shefrd kutta kaha jaataa tha, baad main unhen altadayutsche schapherhund yaa puraane german shefrd ke naam se bulaaye jane laga
 The Shepherd Dogs were first introduced to the UK in 1908 and the UK Canal Club recognized the breed in 1919
 is nasal ke german bhashaa se sidhe anuwaad hue naam ko aadhikarik rup se kaam main liya jane laga va ise hi nasal panjikaran main kaam main liya gaya, haalaaki pratham vishwa yudgh ke baad mana gaya kii iske naam main german shabd is nasal kii lokapriyata ko nuksaan pahuuchaa saktaa he kyon kii us samay germany ke khilaaf veg tha
 The breed was officially named the Allesian Wolf Dog by the UK Canal Club, which was later adopted by many international canal clubs
 baad main bhediya kutta iske naam se hataa diya gaya
 But his name lasted until Alsacean five decades, in 1977, under pressure from dog lovers, the British Canal Club had to re-register as German Shepherd
 aaj kii aadhunik german shefrd kutto kii nasal pe yah aarope lagata he ki wo von steffnitz kii vaastavik vichaardhaara se alag ho gayi he
 He believed that this crop should be produced just for work and if any mistake is found by the descendants, it should be removed immediately and the yield should also be transferred
 aalochakon kaa maananaa he ki beparwaah paidaavaar ke kaaran nasal main kai trutiyaa va vanshaagat rog uttapan ho gaye hai
 In the time of Stefanitz it was immediately corrected to find any error, as nowadays there is no regulation on the yield of the crop and there is no central registration unit on such errors, such as the color of the ax bone
 Shifting, weakness of nature and loss of one or two teeth has become common, even in childhood having twisted ears which are not straight even when they grow up

 They have long and straight ears that look open from the front, they also often fall backward during sports
 inaki lambi gardan hoti he jo kii jab yah uttejit hote hai to uppar kii or tan jaati he va tej dodane par yaa niraash hone par niche ho jaati he
 Their asking is hairy and twisted which goes to the hock

 Some rare colors can also be found in this color, such as whole black, all white, blue, sable or liver color
 puure kaale rang kii nasal ko zyaadaatar manako par sahi samajha jaataa he jabaki nile or jigar ke rang ke kutto ko nasal kii ghambheer truti mana jaataa he or puure safed rang ke ko kai maanak turant hi kaarij kar dete hai
 This is why it looks more easily due to the white color, that is why it becomes an inadequate safety dog, as well as in difficult areas like snow, or where they have to live with sheep and goats, it becomes difficult to see them

 Zainendra was a unique explorer of his path
 unhone premachand ke saamaajik yatharth ke maarg ko nahin apanaaya, jo apane samay kaa rajmarg tha
 But he was not the antonym of Premchand, as many critics have proved; He was a complement to Premchand
 premachand or jainendra ko saath-saath rakhkar hi jivan or itihaas ko uski samagrata ke saath samajha ja saktaa he
 Jainendra's greatest contribution was in the creation of Hindi prose
 bhashaa ke str par jainendra dwaara kii gai tod-phod ne hindi ko taraashne kaa abhootpurv kaam kiya
 The prose of the unknowable would not have been possible if Jainendra's prose were not there
 hindi kahani ne prayogshiltaa kaa pehla paath jainendra se hi siikhaa
 Zainendra gave Hindi a transparent language and break, gave a new tone, a new `syntax '
 aaj ke hindi gadhy par jainendra kii amit chhap he
 - Ravindra Kalia has come out of the inclusion of philosophical and metaphysical elements in almost all the novels of Zainendra, but wherever these elements are included in the novels, they seem to create a difference of characters
 yahi kaaran he ki janendra ke paatr bahya vaataavaran or paristhitiyon se aprabhavit lagate hai or apni antarmukhi gatiyon se sanchalit
 Their reactions and behavior are also often in line with these motions
 isi kaa ek parinaam yah bhi hua he ki janendra ke upanyaason main charitron kii bharmaar nahin dikhaai detii
 The lack of characters has also led to the prominence of individual elements in Zainendra's novels
 krantikarita tathaa aatankvadita ke tatv bhi janendra ke upanyaason ke mahatvapurn aadhaar he
 The leading male characters in all his novels believe in a strong revolution
 bahya swabhaav, ruchi or vyavhaar main ek prakaar kii komalta or bhirutha kii bhaavana liye hokar bhi ye apane antar main mahaan vidhvansak hote hai
 This subversive personality of hers is created as a result of her reaction to the romantic disapproval of the woman
 isi kaaran jab ve kisi nari kaa thodaa bhi aashray, sahanubhuti yaa prem pate hai, tab tuutakar gir padate hai or tabhi unka bahya swabhaav komal ban jaataa he
 Janendra's female characters are often prominent in the novel
 upanyaaskaar ne apane nari paatro ke charitra-chithran main sookshm manovaigyanik drushti kaa parichay diya he
 Jainendra has been able to credibly mark the diverse forms of women, her abilities and reactions
 'sunita', 'tyaagptr' tathaa 'sukhada' aadi upanyaason main aise anek avasar aae hai, jab unke nari charitra bheeshan maansik sangharsh kii sthiti se guzare hai
 The feeling of incompleteness and interdependence of woman and man is the basic basis of this struggle
 vah apane prati purush ke aakarshan ko samajhati he, samarpan ke liye prastut rahati he or poorak bhaavana kii is kshamta se aalhadit hoti he, parantu kabhi-kabhi jab vah purush main is aakarshan moh kaa abhaav dekhati he, tab kshubdh hoti he, vyathit hoti he
 In the same way, when it comes to expectation of harshness from a man, it also becomes unbearable
 kabza, kulaba, chul yaa dvarasandhi ek aise bering ko kehete hai jo do thos vastuon se judaa ho or ek ko duusare ke sambandh main ghoomane de
 For example, a door is often attached to the wall with the occupant and is opened and closed by rolling it over the occupant
 jeevigyaan main bhi kabze dekhe jate hai, masalan ghutana or sharir ke kai anya jod kabzon kaa kaam karte hai
 Note that although every possession is now called kulaba, it was actually a loop in which a fort was placed on one side of the door, on which the door could rotate
 sharir rachana vigyaan mutrashay vah aantarik ang he jo mutr visarjan ke pehle vrikkon dwaara nirmit mutr ko ikattha rakhata he

 dow dwarkanath shaantaram kotnis ek bhartiya chikitsak the jinhen 1938 ke china-japan yuddh ke samay anya chaar chikitsakon ke saath chikitsakeey sahaayta pradaan karne ke liye china bheja gaya tha
 Hanzhi or Chinese charts are expressions used to write Chinese language and Japanese language
 inhen chini ke liye jab prayog kiya jaae to yah haanazi kehalaate hai or jab japani ke liye prayog kiya jaae to kanji kehalaate hai
 In ancient times they were also used for Korean language and Vietnamese language
 chini bhavchitra duniya kii sab se puraani chalati aa rahi likhane kii vidhi he
 Although there are tens of thousands of images in Chinese, but most of these are only seen in historical writings
 adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki saadhaaran chini main sakshar hone ke liye teen se chaar hazaar bhavchitron kaa jaananaa kaafii he
 Every Chinese phrase has an accent and a meaning attached to it, and most Chinese words are written with two expressions
 yah dhyaan rahe ki uccharan upbhasha or bhashaa ke saath badalata he
 It is not like the Devanagari script that a letter has the same pronunciation everywhere
 ise samajhane ke liye sochiye ki agar koi pahaad kaa chitra dekhe to vah sabko samaj aa jayega, lekin hindi bolne vaala us shabd ko 'parvat' kahegaa, farsi bolne vaala 'koh' kahegaa or angrezi bolne vaala 'mountain' kahegaa
 Chinese expressions often have two or three forms: samay ke saath-saath bahut saare bhavchitra prachlit ho chuke the or unamem se bahut likhane main bade pechide the, isliye japan or china kii sarkaron ne inamen kuch maanakeekaran or sarleekaran kiye hai
 With this, many words in the Chinese language have two forms - the traditional Chinese form and the simplified Chinese form
 bahut se shabdon ke japani or chini rup bhi milte-julate lekin zaraa bhinn hote hai
 There are several categories of Chinese charts: yah kabhi chitra hua karte the lekin likhaai main aasaani laane ke liye or maanakeekaran karne ke baad inaki shaklein thodi badal gai hai
 For example, व्यक्ति means 'person', 日 ie 'sun', 月 means 'moon' and 木 means 'tree'
 lagbhag 4% chini bhavchitra is shrenee ke hai
 In English, the words in this category are called 'pictogram'
 yah chitron main thodaa pher-badal kar ke unhen anya matlab dete hai
 For example, where 木 means 'tree', जोड़कर is formed by joining two trees, which means 'clump'
 agar teen vriksh jodakar 森 likhe, to iskaa arth 'jangal' hota he
 In the same way चाकू means 'knife' but by marking its edge, 刃 is made, ie 'edge'
 zaraa-zaraa se nishaan banane se nae arthon vaale shabd banaae gaye hai
 In English, the words in this category are called 'idiogram'
 inamen ek se adhik chitron yaa bhavchitron ko jodakar nae arthon vaale shabd banaae jate hai
 For example, combining 'sun' and 'i
e
' moon 'makes' light'
 yadi vyakti ko ped se joda jaae to 休 banataa he, jiskaa matlab he 'vishram' 
 Similarly, adding 女 and 子 makes 好, meaning 'good' is determined
 haalanki isapar kuch bhashavaigyanikon kaa vivaad he, isaki ek anya misaal 'chat' ke liye 宀 chihn ko 'stri' ke liye 女 chihn ke saath milakar 安 bananaa he, jiskaa arth 'shaanti' he 
 Even in modern times, such new expressions have been fabricated according to need
 platinum ek moolyawaan safed dhaatu hoti he, jiske liye bhavchitra 鉑 he, jo 'safed' or 'dhaatu' ko milakar bana he
 In the same way, combining 'meter' and 'thousand' was made - it started being used around the end of the nineteenth century
 angrezi main is shrenee ke shabdon ko 'idiogramic compoundj' kehete hai
 Sometimes it has happened that there was no sign for anything but if the word was pronounced by another word for which the image was, then that mark was used for both
 masalan, bahut chini bhashaaon main 'zee' shabd kaa arth 'naak' bhi tha or 'swayan' bhi tha
 The symbol for 'nose' was और and it also came to be used for 'self'
 vaqt ke saath is chihn kaa 'naak' arth to bhula diya gaya or aadhunik chini lipi main iskaa arth sirf 'swayan' rah gaya he
 The name of this category is derived from 'rebus' English
 chini lipi ke sab se adhik shabd is shrenee ke hote hai
 They contain one or more signs that describe the meaning of the word and a graphic that has nothing to do with the meaning but is a sign of something that is similar to the word
 is se shabd kaa uccharan or matlab donon pataa chal jate hai
 For example, 'river', 'lake', 'waterfall', 'very strong water stream, or flushed water' and 'slippery'
 gaur kijiye kii har chihn kii bai taraf teen choti lakeeren hai, jo 'nadi' ke chitra ko saral karke bana he
 This indicates that the word is related to 'water'
 shabd kaa dai taraf kaa hissaa sirf dhwani bataata he
 On the right side of 中 is,, which means 'beech' in Chinese and is pronounced 'zhong'
 dekha ja saktaa he ki 沖 kah rahaa he 'pani se sambandhit shabd, jiskaa uccharan jhong se miltaa he', yani 'chong'
 In English, the meaning that describes such expressions is called 'radical' and the words in this category are called 'phono-semantic Compounds'
 is shrenee ke bhavchitra sabase pehle shang rajvansh ke jamaane main viksit hue the or us samay ke khandhiron main mili haddiyon par kharonche hue mili hai
 Sometimes a word is formed from two expressions in which the meaning is applied to both images
 masalan china kaa ek sangeet vaadya he, 'biva' or ek fal he 'laukaat'
 Both of these shapes are seen
 biva ko 批把 likhaa jaataa tha, jisamen donon chihnon kii bai taraf ek upar-neeche jate haath kaa arth sanket he, yani upar-neeche haath chalaakar vaadya bajaanaa
 Now by changing the meaning of 'hand' in it, applying the radical of 'tree' became the symbol of इसमें
 is nae do chihnon vaale shabd kaa matlab 'laukaat kaa fal' tha
 The symbols of the Biwa instrument itself changed over time and are 琵琶 in modern Chinese
 bhashaaon main sajaateey shabd ve hote hai jo kabhi ek hi hua karte the lekin samay ke saath-saath inke swar alag ho gaye hai or kabhi-kabhi arth bhi badal gaye hai
 For example, the word 'husband' in Sanskrit and the word 'potent' in English originate from the same primitive indo-european language word, but over time both their pronunciation and meaning have varied
 chini bhashaa main bhi aisa hua he
 For example, 'cao' and 'lao' were once the same word, but over time, both their pronunciation and expressions have differed
 is shrenee ke bhavchitra chini lipi main kam hai or angrezi main is shrenee ko 'transformd cognats' bulaayaa jaataa he
 Comifora Mukul Hook
 guggul yaa 'guggal' ek vriksh he
 a resin-like substance derived from it is also called 'googling'
 bharat main is jati ke do prakaar ke vriksh paae jate hai
 One is Comifora mukul and the other is called c
 Says Rocksburghei
 africa main pai janevaali prajati comifora africana kehalaati he
 The color of Guggul obtained from some places is white to yellowish and others is dark red
 isamen mithi mahak rahati he
 When it is put in fire, the place is filled with fragrance
 isaliye iskaa dhoop ke sadrush vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 According to Ayurveda, it is bitter and hot and contains Kapha, Baat, Kas, Worm, Claid, Inflammation and haemorrhage
 guggal ek chota ped he jiske pattey chote or ekaantar saral hote hai
 It grows only during the rainy season and at this time leaves appear
 shesh samay yani sardi tathaa garmi ke mausam main isaki vruddhi avaruddha ho jaati he tathaa parnheen ho jaataa he

 Judo is a modern Japanese martial art and combat sport created in 1882 in Japan by Dr
 Kano Jigoro
 isaki sabase pramukh visheshta iskaa pratispardhi tatv he, jiskaa uddeshy apane pratidwandvi ko yaa to jameen par patakana, gatiheen kar dena yaa nahin to kushti kii chaalon se apane pratidwandvi ko apane vash main kar lenaa, yaa joint lock karke arthath jodon ko uljhaakar yaa galaa ghontkar yaa dam ghontu takneekon kaa istemaal karke apane pratidwandvi ko samarpan karne ke liye majaboor kar dena he
 Hand and foot strikes and blows, as well as weapons protection, are a part of judo but are only used in pre-arranged methods as it is not allowed in judo competition or free practice
 judo ke liye viksit darshan or parvarti prashikshan anya aadhunik japani marshall art ke model ban gaye jinka vikaas paaramparik skulon se hua tha
 The worldwide spread of judo has led to the development of several sub-disciplines such as Sambo, Baratitsu and Brazilian jiu-jitsu after the introduction of Judo in Brazil in 1914 by Mitsuyo Maeda
 judo ke abhyaasakartaaon yaa peshewaron ko judoka kaha jaataa he
 The early history of judo cannot be distinguished from its founder, the Japanese erudite and teacher Jigoro Kano
 kaano kaa janm ek khushhaal japani parivaar main hua tha
 His grandfather was a wine maker from the Shiga-ruled province of central Japan, achieving success in his hard work
 baharhaal, kaano ke pita apane pita ke sabase bade bete nahin the or isliye unhen yah kaarobaar viraasat main nahin mila
 Instead, he became a Shinto priest and government official and at the same time he had sufficient sovereignty to enroll his son in the second coming class of Tokyo Imperial University
 kaano apane bachapan main kaaphi kamjor the, unka kad bhi kaaphi kam tha or unka vajan bees saal kaa hone par bhi ek sau pound se zyada nahin tha or vah aksar dabangon dwaara sataae jate the
 He followed jujutsu at the age of 17, when the art was beginning to end, but he achieved very little success in it
 aisa kuch had tak unhen ek chaatr ke rup main apnaane vaale ek shikshak ke milane main takalif hone kii vajah se hua tha
 He continued to study his martial arts while going to university to study literature at the age of 18, and eventually he heard of Fukuda Hachinosuke, the master of Tenjin Shin'yo-riu and grandfather of Keiko Fukuda, Joe Kano is the only surviving student of Kano and the highest ranked female judoka in the world
 kaha jaataa he ki phukuda hachinosuke ne judo main mukt abhyaas par kaano ke gurucharan ke beej bokar aupchaarik abhyaas kii takanic par jor diya tha
 More than a year after Kano joined Fukuda's school, Fukuda fell ill and died
 uske baad kaano ek anya tengin shin'yo-riyu skool ke chaatr ban gaye jo iso masatomo kaa tha jo phukuda kii tulana main purv-vyavasthit tareekon ke abhyaas par zyada jor dete the
 On the strength of his dedication, Kano quickly acquired the title of accomplished instructor and at the age of 21 became Iso's assistant instructor
 durbhaagya se, iso jald biimaar pad gaye or kaano ne yah mahasoos karte hue kito-riyu ke aikubo sunetoshi ke chaatr banakar ek duusari style ko apana liya ki unhen abhi bahut kuch siikhnaa he
 Like Fukuda, Ikubo placed much emphasis on free practice
 duusari taraf, kito-riyu main tengin shin'yo-riyu kii tulana main kaaphi had tak patakane kii takneekon par jor diya jaataa tha
 By this time, Kano was devising new techniques, such as "shoulder wheel" and "floating hip" bets
 However, he was already considering doing more than just expanding the principles of kito-ryu and Tenjin shin'yeo-ryu
 nae vichaaron se bhare kaano ke dimag main jujutsu ke ek pramukh sudhaar kii yojana thi jisaki takneekein kaaphi achche vaigyanik siddhanton par aadhaarit thi or jiskaa mukhya uddeshy marshall art kii bahaduree ke vikaas ke alaava yuvaaon ke sharir, dimag or charitra kaa bhi vikaas karnaa tha
 In May 1882, at the age of 22, at the end of his undergraduate degree at the university, Kano began training jujutsu to nine students of Ikubo's school in a Buddhist temple called Aisho-ji in Kamakura, and Ikubo He used to come there three days a week to help in training
 haalanki us mandir ko "kodocan" yaa "tarika sikhaane kii jagah" ke naam se pukaare jane se pehle do saal biit chuke the or kaano ko us vaqt tak kito-riyu ke "master" yaa guru kaa khitaab nahin diya gaya tha, lekin ise ab kodocan kii sansthapana mana jaataa he
 Judo was actually known as kano jiu-jitsu or kano jiu-do and later kodokan jiu-do or simply jiu-do or judo
 shuru ke dinon main ise us vaqt tak saamaanya rup se keval jiu-jitsu ke rup main bhi sanderbhit kiya jaataa tha
 The word "judo" derives from the same hieroglyphs from where the word "jujutsu" originated: "jū", which can also mean "gentleness", "tenderness", "flexibility" and "easy" depending on its context
 is
 haalanki jū kaa anuwaad karne ke aise prayaas bhraamak hote hai
 The use of jū in each of these terms is a clear reference to the martial arts theory of the "soft method"
 komal tareeke ko pratidwandvi ko haraane ke liye lagaae jane vaale bal ke apratyaksh anuprayog dwaara abhilakshyit kiya jaataa he
 More specifically, it is the principle of using one's opponent's strengths against them and adapting to changing circumstances
 udhaaharan ke liye, hamalavar par uskaa pratidwandvi hamalaa karne ke liye ek taraf hat saktaa he or use aage kii taraf patakane ke liye apni takat kaa istemaal kar saktaa he 
 kaano ne jujutsu ko chaalon kii ek asangat thili ke rup main dekha jise vah ek siddhant ke anusaar ekajute karnaa chaahate the jiskaa samaadhaan unhen "adhiktam kshamta" kii dharna main mila
 Jujutsu techniques relying only on superior strength were accepted or rejected in favor of redirecting the opponent's force, distorting the opponent's balance, or using better leverage
 judo or jujutsu ke duusare lakshanon main antar he
 Where jujutsu means "art" of tenderness, "science", or "technique", judo means "path" of tenderness
 "dō" ke istemaal, jiskaa matlab rasta, sadak yaa path he, main darshanik makasad chipa hua he
 This is similar to the difference between Budo and Bujutsu
 is shabd ke istemaal se pracheen marshall art ke us vichaar ko nikaal diya gaya he jiskaa ekmaatr uddeshy jaan se maarna tha
 Kano saw judo as a means of overcoming and improving himself physically, mentally, emotionally and morally
 He also expanded the physical principle of maximum potential in daily life and developed it into "mutual prosperity"
 is sambandh main, judo ko dojo kii bandishon ke baahar acchhee tarah se jivan kaa vistaar karne ke ek samgr drushtikon ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 The practitioner of judo is known as judoka or "judo practitioner", although traditionally only those with fourth dan or higher status were called "judoka"
 jab kisi angrezi sangya shabd ke saath -ka pratyay jod diya jaataa he to iskaa matlab ek aise vyakti se hota he jo us vishay kaa visheshgy hota he yaa jiske paas us vishay kaa vishesh gyaan hota he
 Other practitioners below the fourth dan were called Kenkyu-sei or "trainees"
 aadhunik samay main judoka kaa matlab kisi bhi str kii visheshgyata vaale judo abhyaasakarta se he
 The judo teacher is called sensei
 sensei shabd kii utpatti sen yaa saki or sei se hui he jiskaa matlab us vyakti se he jo aapse pehle aayaa he
 In the Western Dojo, it is common for any trainer with dan status to be called a sensei
 paramparaagat rup se, vah kitaab chauthe dan yaa usase oonche darje ke prashikshakon ke liye arakshit he
 Traditionally Judo practitioners wear a white colored uniform called Judogi which generally means the "judo dress" worn to practice Judo
 kabhi-kabhi is shabd ko chota karke keval 'gi ' ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Judogi was produced by Kano in 1907, and later similar uniforms were adopted by many other martial arts
 aadhunik judogi safed yaa nile rang kii sooti ke kapade kii karshan dori vaali pant or isse mail khaati hui safed yaa nile rang kii sooti ke kapade kii razaai kii tarah sili hui jacket se bana hota he jise ek belt se kas diya jaataa he
 The belt or waistband is usually colored to indicate status or position
 jacket ko is iraade se banaaya jaataa he ki vah kushti ke dabaav ko jhel sake or isiilie ise karate kii vardi kii tulana main kaaphi motaa banaaya jaataa he
 The Judogi is made in such a way that it is easy to hold the opponent on it while Karategi is made from the material that makes the raincoat coat so that the opponent cannot get hold of this material
 aajkal ke nile judogi ke istemaal kaa sabase pehla suzav 1986 ke maustrict ijeef disi meeting main anton gisink ne diya tha
 For the competition, one of the two contestants wears a blue color pair to make it easier for judges, decision-makers and spectators to differentiate the two
 In Japan, both judokas use a white colored judogi and a traditional red sash is affixed to a contestant's belt
 Outside of Japan, a colored sash can also be used to facilitate minor contestants' contests, a blue color pair only required for regional or high level competitions
 japani abhyaasakarta or shuddhtavaadi nile range ke judogi ke istemaal ko tuchh samajhate hai
 While judo includes various types of legs, such as rolling, falling, throwing, squatting, strangulation, jiggling and attacking joints, more attention is paid to throwing and groundwork in particular
 phenkane kii takanic ko do tarah ke takneekon ke samooh main vibhajit kiya gaya he jisame se ek he - sthaayee takanic or doosraa he - sacrifice techniques 
 iske alaava sthaayee takanic ko hand techniques, hip techniques or foot and leg techniques main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 The sacrifice technique is divided into those in which the thrower falls directly backwards and those in which he falls onto his side
 jamini ladaai kii takneekon ko attacks against the joints or joint locks, strangleholds or chokeholds or holding or pinning techniques main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 a type of boxing is practiced in judo known as randori which means "free practice"
 randori main, do pratidwandvi judo kii kisi bhi patakane yaa pakadaney kii takanic kaa istemaal karke ek duusare par hamalaa kar sakate hai
 Kata retains techniques of hitting, such as kicking and punching, as well as knives and swordplay techniques
 is tarah kaa adhyaapan aam taur par oonche darje ke abhyaasakartaaon ke liye arakshit hota he, lekin pratiyogita main isaki manaahi hoti he or suraksha kii drushti se aam taur par randori main ise nishedh kar diya jaataa he
 From the point of view of safety, strangulation, dislocating joints and sacrificial techniques are banned on the basis of age and status
 udhaaharan ke liye, sanyukt rajya america main galaa ghontne kii takanic kaa istemaal karne ke liye vyakti kii umr 13 yaa usase adhik honi chahie or bhujaaon ko uljhane kii takanic kaa istemaal karne ke liye 16 yaa usase adhik umr kaa hona jaruri he
 In the practice of rhetoric and competition, when one opponent is able to use a strangulation or joint manipulation technique, the other opponent gives up or is "beaten" and thus beats the opponent twice
 Giving up gives a clear indication that the opponent has lost
 jab aisa hota he to match khatm ho jaataa he or maat khaane vaala khilaadi haar jaataa he or us par kiye gaye galaa ghontne yaa jodon ko uljhane kii takanic se use aaazaad kar diya jaataa he
 Spun forms are pre-arranged methods of attack and defense that are practiced in judo with a partner for the purpose of mastering the techniques of judo
 adhik vishesh rup se, unke uddeshyon main shaamil hai - judo ke buniyadi siddhanton ko samajhaana, takanic ke sahi istemaal kaa pradarshan karnaa, un darshanik siddhanton kii shiksha dena jis par judo aadhaarit he, un takneekon ke abhyaas kii ijaajat dena jinhen pratiyogita main istemaal karne kii ijaajat nahin hoti he or un pracheen takneekon ko surakshit rakhana jo aitihaasik drushti se mahatvapurn he lekin jinka ab samakaleen judo main istemaal nahin kiya jaataa he
 Knowledge of different types of spun is required to get high status
 aaj ke daur main kodocan dwaara manyata praapt saat kata is prakaar hai: There are also some spun ones that have not been officially recognized by Kodokan but continue to practice
 inkaa sabase pramukh udhaaharan 'go no sen no kata' naamak ek kata he jisamen prayasarat prahaar par javaabi hamalaa karne par dhyaan diya jaataa he
 Judo emphasizes a free-style boxing practice called randori which is one of its main forms of training
 mukaable ke samay kaa kuch bhaag mukkebaaji ke abhyaas ko sthaayee banane main lag jaataa he jise tachi-waja kehete hai or baaki kaa bhaag jameen par lagata he jise ne-waja kehete hai
 Boxing is also practiced according to the rules of safety, which is more lively than simply practicing the techniques that jujutsuka used to do before
 puri takat ke istemaal se shaareerik drushti se mansapeshiyon or hridayavahini tantra kaa vikaas hota he or maansik drushti se ranneeti or pratikriya samay kaa vikaas hota he or ek virdohi pratidwandvi ke khilaaf takneekon kaa istemaal karne kii sikh hasil karne main abhyaasakarta ko madad milti he
 There is a common saying among judokas, “the best training of judo is judo
 " There are many types of boxing exercises, such as Xu Renshu; And Kakari Geiko judo main, ladaai karne ke do mukhya charan hote hai: khadaa hokar yaa sthaayee charan, tachi-waja ; or jamini charan, ne-waja ; prayek charan ke liye apni khud kii takneekon, ranneetiyon, randori, condishning yaa anukulan, ityadi kii jarurat padati he
 Special training in "transitional" techniques is also given to bridge the gap
 judoka ek charan main kaaphi kushal ho saktaa he or duusare charan main thodaa kamjor bhi pad saktaa he jo is baat par nirbhar karata he ki unki zyaadaatar dilchaspee kismen hai haalanki zyaadaatar donon ke darmyaan santulit hote hai
 Judo's inclusion of both permanent and on-field stages of combat gives Judoka the ability to pull down her permanent or standing opponent and then force her to surrender by giving her trouble on the ground
 sthaayee yaa khadey charan main, jise pratiyogita ke niyamon ke anusaar pradhanta milti he, pratidwandvi ek duusare ko patakane kii koshish karte hai yaa khadey hokar jodon ko uljhane or galaa ghontkar / galaa dabaakar samarpan karne par majaboor karne vaali takanic kaa istemaal karte hai jabaki niyam ke hisaab se khadey yaa sthaayee charan main aisa bahut kam hota he kyonki patakane kii tulana main khadey rahakar in takneekon kaa istemaal karnaa zyada mushkil hota he
 However, some judokas are quite adept at using both techniques of forcing their opponent down, as well as forcing them to surrender, where the technique of forcing surrender begins in a standing position and ends on the ground
 it occurs
 haalanki jodon ko uljhaakar patakane kii takanic kaa istemaal karnaa nishiddh he
 The main purpose of the downward technique is to slam an opponent standing on his feet, standing in a dynamic position or standing in a dangerous position, on the ground on his back where he cannot move as effectively
 is prakaar, neeche giraane yaa patakane kii mukhya vajah pratidwandvi ko kaabo main karnaa or khud ko prabhaavshaalee sthiti main laana he
 In this way the practitioner has more ability to produce a conclusive result
 pratidwandvi ko neeche giraane kaa ek or kaaran jameen par use jabardastee patakekar uske sharir ko chot pahunchaana bhi he
 If the opponent downsizes his opponent with great force and complete control, he can clearly win the match on the basis that he has demonstrated sufficient superiority, being given less points if he falls down less effectively
 is
 khadey hokar apane pratidwandvi ko neeche giraane par hi giraanevaale pratidwandvi ko ank diya jaataa he
 In harmony with Kano's mastery of scientific analysis and reasoning, standard Kodokan judo pedagogy determines that any downward technique is theoretically a four-step phenomenon: distorting equilibrium; body positioning; execution; And finally the finish or coup de grâce
 Each step is followed much faster than the previous step ; Ideally all steps follow almost simultaneously
 isi tarah, chot lagane kii zyada sambhaavna hone kii vajah se maarane kii takanic kaa istemaal karne kii ijaajat nahin di jaati he lekin khilaadi ko prashikshan ke dauraan "is takanic ko dhyaan main rakhana" hota he, udhaaharan ke liye, zyada der tak jhukkar ladaai na karnaa, kyonki is sthiti main badi aasaani se ghutanon par hamalaa karke yaa anya jagahon par hamalaa karke ghayal kiya ja saktaa he
 In the competition, the contest on the ground may continue after the downing process or else the contestants may legally end their fight on the ground; Contestants are not allowed to fall to the ground just to start the ne-vaja
 jameen par, pratiyogiyon kaa lakshya apane pratidwandvi kaa galaa ghontkar yaa galaa dabaakar yaa uski bhujaaon ko uljhaakar yaa to use neeche giraae rakhana yaa use samarpan karne par majaboor kar dena he
 Hold downs, self-defense, police work and military hands-on combat are important because the person who overcomes his opponent can defend or attack quite easily
 judo main, yadi pakad kar neeche giraane kii koshish ko pachchis second tak banaae rakhaa jaataa he, to is takanic kaa istemaal karne vaala vyakti match jeet jaataa he
 Osakomi tries to knock his opponent down primarily by holding his back and if he turns to the front or side, a mat will be called
 
 After that the two judokas will stand again and after that they will continue their fight or continue fighting
 1905 main sthapit niyamon ke anusaar, pratidwandvi ko keval uske kandhon se do second tak pakad kar rakhana jaruri tha—kaha jaataa he ki ek samurai ko apni chaaku yaa talwaar tak pahunchane or apane pakade hue pratidwandvi ko haarane ke liye itnaa hi samay lagata tha
 The new longer requirements may relate to the combat reality that the fighter, police officer, or soldier must stagnate their opponent in sufficient time to establish control over the situation
 judo main, kabhi-kabhi pakad kar rakhane kii takanic ke parinamswaroop pratidwandvi samarpan kar saktaa he yadi us pratidwandvi main us pakad ke dabaav ko sahane kii kshamta na ho yaa pakad ko banaae rakhane ke liye samarpan karne par majaboor karne kii takanic kaa istemaal kiya gaya ho
 In addition, if the technique of strangling or engaging the arms becomes too heavy on the judoka, or if the judoka starts to ache or gets hurt, he can surrender
 agar pakad kar giraae jane vaale vyakti ne apane pairon ko apane pratidwandvi ke sharir ke nichle bhaag yaa dhad ke kisi hisse ke ird-gird lapet liya he to vah bhi apane pratidwandvi ko utana hi giraane kii koshish kar rahaa hota he jitani koshish uskaa pratidwandvi use giraane ke liye kar rahaa hota he kyonki uskaa pratidwandvi tab tak khadaa nahin ho saktaa he or aaazaad nahin ho saktaa he jab tak neeche uske sharir se lipta hua vyakti use nahin chodta he
 The bottom man can use various attacking techniques on his opponent, including strangling, entangling arms, while wrapping his legs around his opponent to make him unable to attack effectively from above
 And "body Scissors", meaning 'causing difficulty in breathing by putting pressure on the body'
 is haalat main, jise japani bhashaa main "do-osa " kehete hai jiskaa matlab "trunk hold" arthath 'dhad par dabaav banaae rakhana' he, upar vaala vyakti osakomi kahalaane vaali is sthiti kii vajah se apane pratidwandvi par paryaapt niyantran nahin rakh paata he
 The person above may try to escape from his opponent's feet and in turn force him to fall down or surrender, or he may try to break his opponent's guard and stand up
 neeche vaala vyakti apane guard vaali takanic kii madad se apane pratidwandvi ko samarpan karne par majaboor karne kii koshish kar saktaa he yaa apane pratidwandvi ke upar chadhane ke liye use ludhakaane kii koshish kar saktaa he
 Joint lock ie 'jointing technique' is generally known as 'arm lock' ie 'arm entangling technique'
 yah mukaable kii prabhaavshaalee takanic he kyonki isse ek judoka apane pratidwandvi ko dard dekar use apane kaabo main karne main sakasham ho jaataa he yaa jarurat padane par uljhaae hue jodon ko bhi todane main sakasham ho jaataa he
 The use of the technique of engaging the elbow joints by applying almost full force in the competition to force your opponent to surrender is considered quite safe
 ateet main, judo main pairon ko uljhane, kalai ko uljhane, ridh kii haddi ko uljhane or vibhinn tarah kii anya takneekon kaa istemaal karne kii ijaajat thi jise khilaadiyon kii suraksha ko dhyaan main rakhte hue pratiyogita main varjit kar diya gaya he
 It has been decided that players will suffer many injuries due to attacking those joints and due to this, the condition of those joints will gradually deteriorate
 Nevertheless, some judokas still enjoy informally learning and fighting each other using these techniques that are prohibited in formal competitions but related arts such as Sambo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and jujutsu are still in them
 Many techniques have been actively used since
 Chokes and strangulations ko aam taur par or saamaanya rup se galaa dabaakar dam ghontne kii takanic ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 With this help a person can use the strangling technique to make his opponent unconscious and even to sleep to death
 galaa dabaane kii takanic kaa istemaal karne par gardan kii greeva dhamni par dabaav padane se mastishk tak hone vaali khun kii aapurti band ho jaati he jabaki galaa ghontne kii takanic kaa istemaal karne par gardan ke saamne kaa vayumarg avaruddha ho jaataa he
 These words are often used interchangeably and are not formally differentiated in their use by most judokas
 pratiyogita main, us samay judoka kii jeet ho jaati he jab uskaa pratidwandvi samarpan kar detaa he yaa behosh ho jaataa he, kyonki galaa dabaane kii takanic kaa sahi tarah se istemaal hone par pratidwandvi bas kuch second main hi behosh ho saktaa he lekin iske baad turant mukt kar dene par aam taur par koi nuksaan nahin hota he
 Judo has evolved into a sport, along with a completely specialized martial art
 olympic main pehali baar judo ko los angeles main yojit 1932 games main dekha gaya tha jahaan kaano or lagbhag 200 judo chaatro ne pradarshan kiya tha
 In the 1964 Games held in Tokyo, judo became an Olympic sport for men
 rena kanokogi, ek america or kai anya kii jidd kii vajah se 1988 main judo mahilaon kaa bhi ek olympic khel ban gaya
 It is often said that the men's judo event in 1964 was a demonstration event, but according to the International Judo Federation (international Judo Union) and the International Olympic Committee, the International Olympic Committee, judo was actually an official sport of the 1964 Games
 hollandwasi anton gisink ne japan ke akiyo kaminaga ko haraakar judo ke open divizan main pehla olympic swarna padak praapt kiya
 Judo's image of being "japanese only" was then lost and became one of the most widely practiced sports in the world
 mahilaon kaa kaarykram 1988 kaa ek pradarshan kaarykram tha or chaar saal baad yah ek aadhikarik padak kaarykram ban gaya
 Men and women compete separately, although they often receive training together
 1988 ke baad se paraolympic judo ek paraolympic khel bana hua he; yah special olympic kaa khel bhi he
 Collegiate competition in the United States, particularly between UC Berkeley and San Jose State University, contributed to refining judo in sports seen at the Olympic Games and World Championships
 1940 ke dashak main henry stone or yosh uchida, cyle or esageesayu ke pramukh coach, ne skulon ke bich aksar hone vaali pratiyogitaaon main istemaal karne ke liye ek wet class system arthath vajan varg pranali viksit kii
 In 1953, Stone and Uchida made a successful request to the Amateur Athletic Union to accept judo as a sport, with their weight class system as an official component
 1961 main, uchida ne paris main ijeef kii baithkon main sanyukt rajya america kaa pratinidhitiv kiya jahaan ijeef ne sabhi bhavi championships ke liye wet class system ko apana liya
 The IJF was built mostly on the basis of the early European Judo Union where weight class systems were also used for many years
 vartmaan main saat wet divizan hai jisamen shaasi nikaayon dwaara badlaav kiya ja saktaa he or pratiyogiyon kii umr ke aadhaar par inamen sanshodhan bhi kiya ja saktaa he: The objective of traditional judo rules is to avoid injury to the participants and to ensure proper etiquette
 dekhne waalon ke liye is khel ko or dilachasp banane ke liye in niyamon main kuch or niyam shaamil kiye gaye
 Penalties can be imposed for staying inactive or using illegal techniques during a match
 yadi koi pratibhaagi mat ke nirdhaarit kshetra ke baahar chalaa jaataa he to ladaai band kar di jaani chahie
 If the groundwork means that the judges and judges need some deliberation during the fight, then the adjudicator will say sono-mama and both will have to stay in the same position
 jab unka kaam ho jaataa he to nirnaayak yoshi kahata he or match chaalu ho jaataa he
 All marks or penalties are awarded by the judge
 nirnaayak dwaara die gaye ank yaa dand ko badalane ke liye nyaayakarta ek faisla le sakate hai
 There is a slight difference in IJF rules to facilitate the judo of blind people
 judo ke ek match kaa uddeshy pratidwandvi ko uske kandhon ke bal jameen par patakana; mukhya rup se uski peeth ke bal jameen par giraanaa; yaa uskaa galaa ghontkar, dam ghontkar yaa uski bhujaaon ko uljhaakar use samarpan karne par majaboor karnaa he
 Ippon is awarded as a point for one of these, after which the match is won immediately
 judo main ank praapt karne ke teen grad yaa darje hai: ippon, waja-ari or yuko 
 ippon kaa shabdic arth "ek ank" hota he jisase match jeeta jaataa he
 Rapidly and vigorously in a controlled manner, the opponent mostly slams his back to the ground; Keeping your opponent on the mat for a substantial period; Or an Ippon is given to force the opponent to surrender
 ippon paane laayak paryaapt shakti yaa niyantran ke pradarshan ke abhaav ke saath pratidwandvi ko jameen par patakane; yaa bees second tak use jameen par giraae rakhane ke liye ek waja-ari diya jaataa he
 a vaja-ari means half a mark and if a vaja-ari is attained, then a full score is made from them which is necessary to win
 yuko, ank praapt karne kaa nichalaa darja he or isaki ginati keval ek 'taai braker' ke rup main kii jaati he; ise anya yuko ankon ke saath nahin joda jaataa he
 Scoring is lexicographic; a Vaja-ari beats out any number of Yuko, but a Vaja-ari and a Yuko outperform the Yukoless Vaja-ari
 apane pratidwandvi pandrah second tak jameen par giraae rakhane par yuko ank praapt hota he
 If a person who uses the technique of knocking down has already received a Vaja-ari, then he or she needs to hold their opponent down to the ground for only twenty seconds in order to earn an Ippon point through two vaja-aris
 
 ek ippon yaa ek waja-ari ank kii aavashyaktaaon ke abhaav ke saath pratidwandvi ko jameen par patakane ke liye ek yuko ank praapt ho saktaa he
 The so-called "skillful takedown" is also allowed to "fall to the ground efficiently" but no points are obtained for it
 yadi match ke ant main kul prapthank ekasmaan hote hai, to is samasya ko golden score' arthath 'swarna ank niyam dwaara suljhaayaa jaataa he
 The Golden Score is an accidental death situation where the clock is re-set for the time of the match, and meanwhile the contestant who wins the first point wins
 agar is avadhi ke dauraan koi ank hasil nahin kiya jaataa he, to hantei arthath 'nirnaayak or do mukhya nyaayakartaaon ke bahumat vichaar' ke madhyam se vijeta kaa nirdhaaran kiya jaataa he
 Judo's scoreboard shows the number of vaja-ari and Yuko received by each player
 ippon dene par match turant khatm ho jane kii vajah se scoreboard par aksar ippon ko nahin dikhaaya jaataa he
 Some computerized scoreboards may indicate a clear indication of an Ippon score
 aam taur par scoreboard par prayek khilaadi ko die gaye dandon kii sankhya or kabhi-kabhi prayek ko di gai chikitsa vyavastha kii sankhya ko bhi dikhaaya jaataa he
 Electronic scoreboards also typically have a timer to measure both contest time and ossecomy time
 vibhinn suraksha sambandhon kaarnon se judo ke niyam hameshaa badalte rahete hai
 They may change depending on the age, status or experience of the judoka
 desh, club yaa pratiyogita ke str ke aadhaar par bhi unamem badlaav ho saktaa he 
 The first is a warning in the form of a penalty that is written on the scoreboard
 duusare dand ke rup main pratidwandvi ko "yuko" ank diya jaataa he
 "vaja-ari" marks are given as the third penalty
 chauthe dand ko "hansoku maake" kaha jaataa he or pratidwandvi ko ek "ippon" ank de diya jaataa he
 The match ends permanently with "hansoku Māke"

 In this case, the player receiving the "hansoku Makae" is eliminated from the tournament
 judo, duniya bhar ke kai sainya akramanakari or rakshaatmak ranneetiyon ke prashikshan kaa aadhaar ban gaya he
 In addition, the combination of judo's background in traditional jujitsu with its police and military uses has resulted in the arrival of kata specifically geared to training the technical principles of self-defense: kime no kata and kodokan goshin jutsu
 Renkoho Vaja includes techniques specifically designed for the police
 joshi judo goshinho main mahilaon kii aatmaraksha kii taikniken shaamil hai
 Other spun groups include self-defense techniques with more difficult methods
 judo ke siddhanton or prashikshan ke tareekon ke vibhinn pahaluon se aatmaraksha main madadgaar sabit hone vaale gunon or kaushalon ko badhaava miltaa he: However, there are some criticisms about the use of judo for self-defense training: apane ne-waja / guttham-gutthi or tachi-waja / khadey hokar guttham-gutthi ke gyaan kaa istemaal karne judo abhyaasakartaaon ne mishrit marshall arts maichon main bhi pratispardhaa kii he

 shinia aoki, jo aaj duniya ke sheersh teen halke vajan vaale mishrit marshall arts abhyaasakartaaon main se ek he, kii bhi prishthbhumi judo main hi he
 Satoshi Ishii, the recipient of the 2008 Olympic gold medal, has retired from judo for full-time competition in MMA
 unhone japani pramotion cengoku ke saath anubandh par hastakshar kiya he
 Other notable MMA fighters wearing black belts in judo include: kaano jigoro kaa kodocan judo, judo kii sabase lokapriy or prasiddh style he, lekin yahi ek akeli style nahin he
 Both the words judo and jujutsu were quite interchangeable in the early years, so either because of this or simply to distinguish them from mainstream judo, some of these forms of judo are still known as jujutsu or jiu-jitsu
 kaano ke judo kii mul style se kai sambandhit roopon kaa vikaas hua he jinamein se kuch roopon ko ab kaaphi had tak alag kala mana jaataa he: Research shows that judo is a safer sport especially for young people, although adult competitive judo has more injuries than other non-confrontational or non-contact ball games, for example, but like other competitive contact sports Huh
 haalanki galaa ghontne kii takanic sambhawatah ek ghaatak takanic he lekin sahi tareeke se istemaal kiye gaye galaa ghontne kii takanic ke falswaroop pratidwandvi ke samarpan kar dene yaa behosh ho jane ke turant baad pratidwandvi ko is giraft se aaazaad kar dene par koi nuksaan nahin hota he
 The strangling technique used in judo is generally taught to more experienced judokas to help ensure the safety of students
 galaa ghonte rakhane kii takanic kaa istemaal karne kii suraksha ko pradarshit karne vaale paryaapt aankade uplabdh hai, or iske prashikshan ke samay apatkaaleen dekhbhaal or phir se hosh main laane kii takanic kaa bhi prashikshan diya jaataa he
 Controlled and properly, the opponent should also pay attention to protecting him from injury while hitting the ground
 haalanki kai paristhitiyon main chot lag sakati he, jaise - yadi jameen par patakane vaala pratidwandvi laaparvaahee se yaa jaanboojhkar jor se patakane ke baad patake jane vaale pratidwandvi par kud padataa he, yaa yadi tori uke ke jodon kii andekhi karte hue use laaparvaahee se jameen par patakata he 
 patakate samay chot lagane se bachaane kaa sabase acha tareeke ke rup main, pratiyogita main chaatro ke pravesh karne se pehle senseyi dwaara unhen sahi tarah se patakane kii takanic kaa istemaal karne ke liye acchhee tarah se abhyaas karana chahie jiske liye unhen "laayak banane" kaa abhyaas, purvavyavasthit tareekon or atyadhik parantu niyantrit evam paryvekshit mukt-abhyaas / mukkebaaji kaa abhyaas karana chahie

 An active contestant may choose not to follow in order to get a higher rank and may choose to concentrate on preparing for the competition; For example, in the 2004 Paralympics a silver medal was won by an IQU female contestant named Lorena Pierce in the category weighing less than 70 kg
 gyaan or kshamta ke alaava, rank paane ke liye aam taur par ek nunatam aayu seemaa kii jarurat padati he
 Therefore, it is not a big deal to see teenager / teenager contestants in the national level competition who have been practicing judo for the last 10 years but due to being too young to qualify for a dan rank they only need blue belt ie a blue belt or brown belt means brown colored belt
 jab ek baar ek vyakti ko ek dan rank kaa ek str praapt ho jaataa he to alag-alag kaarnon se use aage bhi padonnat kiya ja saktaa he jisamen kushalta kaa str, pratiyogita kaa pradarshan or / yaa judo main yogadan, jaise - prashikshan or swayan seva samay, shaamil hai
 Therefore, a higher Dan rank does not necessarily mean that it has a better fighter
 judoka ko judo ke gyaan or kaushal ke anusaar rank diya jaataa he or unke rank kaa pataa unke belt ke rang se chalata he
 There are two divisions of rank: the "grade" of the level below the black belt and the "degree" of the level of the black belt
 This ranking system in martial arts was initiated by Kano and has been largely adopted by modern martial arts since
 jab shuru-shuru main is ranking system ko banaaya gaya tha, us samay chaatro ke chah grad hote the jinhen bade se chote ke sankhyatmak kram main shreneet kiya jaataa tha or saath main pratham cu grad paane ke baad pehali degree ke blike belt kaa darja diya jaataa tha
 There are usually 10 dan ranks which are ranked in numerical order from small to large but according to the theory there is no limit to the number of dan ranks
 dasvin degree ke blike belt or usase upar ke darje ke liye koi aupchaarik aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Yukimitsu Kano, currently the grandson of Kano Jigoro, president of Kodokan, determines the individuals for promotion
 kodocan dwaara is rank ke liye keval pandrah vyaktiyon ko padonnat kiya gaya he
 On 6 January 2006, three people were simultaneously promoted to the 10th Dan: Toshiro Daigo, Ichiro Abe and Yoshimi Osawa
 It is the highest promotion awarded at the same time so far and is the first time in 22 years
 ab tak kisi ko bhi 10wein dan se oonche rank par padonnat nahin kiya gaya he, lekin: Although there should be uniformity in the ranks of dans among national organizations, there is considerable variation in QS grades as some countries are given higher QS grades than other countries
 haalanki shuru main cu grad ke belt ke rang samaan rup se safed hote the, lekin aajkal tarah-tarah ke rangon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In Japan, the use of belt colors is associated with the age of the student
 unnat cu gradon ke liye kuch klbon ke paas keval kaale or safed rang ke belt ho sakate hai jabaki anya club in unnat cu gradon ke liye bhure rang ke belt kaa istemaal kar sakate hai or praathmik vidhyalay str par madhyavarti staron ke liye hare rang kaa belt dikhaai dena aam baat he
 The belt colors for q grades in Australia are white, yellow, orange, green, blue and brown
 dan rankon main se pehle paanch rankon ke liye kaale rang kaa istemaal hota he jabaki 6wein, 7wein or 8wein dan ke panel baari-baari se laal or safed rang kii hoti hai or 9wein or 10wein dan ke belt kaa rang gadha laal hota he
 However, those holding a grade above Godan can often wear a comfortable black belt during regular training
 kuch deshon main junior aayu samoohon ko suchit karne ke liye belton ke upar rangeen sire kaa bhi istemaal hota he
 Historically, women had white stripes along the center of the belt

 The examination itself may include competition and spun
 cu rank aam taur par sthaneey prashikshakon dwaara pradaan kiya jaataa he, lekin dan rank aam taur par keval ek rashtriya judo sangh ke swatantra nyaayakartaaon kii dekharekh main yojit ke pariksha ke baad hi diya jaataa he
 For a rank to be recognized, it must be registered with a national judo organization or Kodokan
 brazil main belt kaa rang aam taur par safed, nila, pilaa, naarangi, haraa, bangnee, bhura or kaala hota he 
 iske atirikt, ekadam yuva judoka ko nile rang ke belt se thik pehle ek dhoosar rang kaa belt diya ja saktaa he
 Sometimes, contestants are organized into two categories based on grading; The first category consists of contestants wearing white to green belts and the second category consists of contestants wearing purple to black belts
 canada main senior yaa varisht khilaadiyon ke belt kaa rang chote se bade ke kram main safed, pilaa, naarangi, nila, bhura or ant main kaala hota he
 Junior or junior players' belts are white-red, white, white-yellow, yellow, yellow-orange, orange, red-green, green-blue, blue, blue-brown and brown
 america main keval senior khilaadiyon ko hi dan level kii ijaajat di jaati he jinhen kaale rang ke belt se suchit kiya jaataa he
 DAN grades awarded by other organizations are recognized by the USJF and USJA
 unnat cu level senior or junior donon khilaadiyon ko mil saktaa he jo kaale rang ko chhodkar kai rangon ke belt pahante hai
 Depending on the organizational affiliation of the dojo, there may be differences in the order of colors of belts from one dojo to another
 senior khilaadiyon ke liye, united stats judo federation or united stats judo association donon ne chah cu ko nirdisht kiya he jise sarini main soochibaddh kiya gaya he
 "beginners" for the USJA means "beginners" have to wear a white belt until they are given a test for a yellow belt
 uasgee, abhyaasakarta ke str ko nirdisht karne ke liye ek pattee pahanane kii bhi sifarish karata he
 This is true for both q and Dan levels
 uasageef juniurs ranking pranali 11wein cu tak ke rankon ko nirdisht karti he
 The USJA Juniors Ranking System assigns twelve levels of QQ rank beginning with "junior 1st degree" and ending with "junior 12th degree"
 jahaan tak senior abhyaasakartaaon kaa sawaal he, uasgee kii sifarish he ki junior khilaadi apane rank ko nirdisht karne ke liye ek pattee dhaaran karen
 When a USJA junior becomes 17 years old, they are converted into senior ranks as follows: saanchaa:martial arts Worshiping more than one deity or assuming the existence of more than one deity is called polytheism or polytheism or polytheism
