 Small-scale sounds, in the order of minor-master utterances, give the volume and when in a poetic composition they harmonize with an arrangement, it is given a classical name and according to the small-master volumes this letter The system starts with a specific name called Chanda, like Chaupai, Doha, Arya, Indravajra, Gayatri Chanda etc

 Therefore, at the root of the word stanza is the sense of motion

 anya vyaktiyon ke liye harbart spencer dekhen
 Herbert Spencer was an English philosopher, zoologist, sociologist and famous traditional liberal political theorist of the Victorian period
 spencer ne bhautik vishwa, jaivik sajivon, maanav man, tathaa maanviya samskruti va samaajon kii kramik vikaas ke rup main utpatti kii ek sarv-samaveshak avadharana viksit kii
 ek bahushrut vyakti ke rup main, unhone vishyon kii ek vyapak shrenee main apana yogadan diya, jinamein nitishasre, dharm, manviki, arthshaasre, rajnatik siddhant, darshanashasre, jeev-vigyaan, samajashasre va manovigyaan shaamil hai
 During his lifetime he gained immense dominance, especially among the English-speaking academic community
 In 1902, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature
 In fact, in the United Kingdom and the United States "there was a time when Spencer's disciples could not even compare him to Aristotle!" ve "sarvshereshth kii uttarjivita " kii avadharana prastut karne ke liye sabase zyada jane jate hai, jo ki unhone charles darwin kii on da origin of spisis padhane ke baad principles of biology main prastut kii thi
 This terminology strongly suggests natural selection, but even when Spencer expanded origins into the fields of sociology and ethics, he also used Lemarkism
 wiliam jorge spencer ke putr harbart spencer kaa janm 27 april 1820 ko darbi, england main hua tha
 Spencer's father was a religious dissenter, whose leanings varied from Methodism to Quakerism, and it appeared that he transmitted all forms of power to his son
 ve johaan henrich pastalozi kii vikasparak shiksha vidhiyon ke anusaar sthapit ek vidhyalay chalaaya karte the or darbi philasofical socity ke sachiv ke rup main bhi kaary kiya karte the, jo ki san 1790 ke dashak main arasmus darwin, charles ke dada, dwaara sthapit ek vaigyanik sanstha thi
 Spencer received experimental science education from his father, while members of the Derby Philosophical Society introduced him to pre-darwinian concepts of biological-origin, notably Erasmus Darwin and jean-baptiste Lamarck
 His uncle, the Reverend Thomas Spencer, pastor of the Hinton Charterhouse near Bath, completed his limited formal education by teaching Spencer some mathematics and physics, and a little Latin, which enabled him to translate simple texts
 Granted Thomas Spencer also left an impression on his nephew of his own firm free-trade and anti-statist political outlook
 Otherwise, Spencer was an educator who gained most of his knowledge from micro-focused studies and conversations with his friends and colleagues
 ek kishor or yuva purush donon ke rup main, spencer ne kisi bhi bauddhik yaa vyavsaayik kshetra main sthir hone main kathinaayee mahasoos kii

 From 1848 to 1853, he served as assistant-editor of the free-trade magazine The Economist, during which he published his first book, Social Statistics, which predicted that humanity would eventually find the necessities of social life According to it will be completely adopted and consequently the concept of the state will be destroyed

 Spencer himself introduced biologist Thomas Henry Huxley, who later became known as 'darwin's Bulldog' and remained his friend for a lifetime
 However, his friendship with Evans and Lewis led him to John Stuart Mill's a System of Logic and Auguste Comte's positivism and this led him on the path of his career
 He completely disagreed with Comte

 Spencer argued that both of these theories were partial descriptions of truth: repetitive associations of ideas involved the creation of specific fibers in brain tissue, and that they be passed from one generation to the other through the Lamarckian methodology of experiment-succession

 Like others of his generation, including members of Chapman's seminar, he was obsessed with the idea of demonstrating that everything in the universe — including human culture, language, and impermanence — was interpreted by the laws of universal validity

 Comte's System de Philosophy was written with the goal of demonstrating the universality of positive natural law, and Spencer had to follow Comte to accomplish his goal

 In 1858, Spencer created an outline, which later became the system of artificial philosophy
 This huge work, with only a small number of compositions in the English language, aimed to demonstrate that the theory of origins applied to biology, psychology, sociology, and impermanence
 spencer kaa vichaar tha ki das khandon kii is rachana ko purna hone main bees varsh lagenge; ant main unhen isse duguna samay laga or isane unke lambey jivan kii lagbhag puri avadhi le lee
 Despite Spencer's early struggle to establish himself as a writer, by the 1870s he had become one of the most famous philosophers of his time

 Through such contacts, Spencer had a strong presence in the heart of the scientific community and was able to create an effective audience for his approach
 In spite of his increasing wealth and fame, he never owned his own house

 An exception to Spencer's growing conservative tendency was that for a lifetime he remained a staunch opponent of militarism and imperialism
 His criticism of the Boer War was particularly damaging and contributed to his diminishing popularity in Britain
 spencer ne aadhunik paper clip ke ek purvavarti kaa avishkaar bhi kiya, haalanki yah aadhunik cotter pin kii tarah adhik dikhaai detaa tha
 This "binding pin" was distributed by Ackerman & Company
 After Appendix i of his autobiography) Spencer displays a picture of this pin as well as a published description of its experiments

 The basis for Spencer's attraction to many people of his generation was that he seemed to present a pre-constructed system of belief that could replace traditional religious beliefs at a time when Orthodox opinion In front of the advancement of modern science, they were broken apart
 spencer kii darshanik pranali yah darshaati hui prathit hoti thi ki unnat vaigyanik avadharanaon, jaise ushmagatiki ke pratham niyam or jaivik utpatti, ke aadhaar par maanavtaa kii antim purnataa par vishwaas kar paanaa sambhav tha
 In short, Spencer's philosophical approach consisted of a combination of deism and positivism
 ek ore, unhone apane pita tathaa darbi philasofical socity ke anya sadasyon se va jorge combay kii atyadhik lokapriy da constitution of main jaisi pustakon se atharahavin sadi ke devvaad kaa kuch ansh grahan kiya tha
 In this, the universe was considered a cosmic harmony and the laws of nature were 'mercifully kind'
 is prakaar prakritik niyam susanchalit brahmad kii pratimaayein thim, jinhen srishtikarta dwaara maanviya prasannataa ko prachaarit karne ke uddeshy se nirmit kiya gaya tha
 Although Spencer renounced his Christian faith as a teenager and later rejected any 'anthropomorphic' concept of divinity, he nevertheless firmly held the concept at an almost subconscious level
 haalanki ve pratyakshvaad ko jitna shrey dete, ve usase bahut adhik grahan kar chuke the, vishesh rup se vaigyanik gyaan kii vibhinn shakhaon ke ekikaran ke rup main ek darshanik pranali ke iske nirmaan main

 This tension between positivism and the rest of their Devism remained throughout the system of artificial philosophy
 vaigyanik satya ke ekikaran ke lakshya main spencer ne comte kaa anusaran kiya; isi arth main unka darshanashasre 'kritrim' hone par kendrit tha
 Like Comte, he was also committed to the universality of natural law, according to which the laws of nature apply as much to the biological field, without exception, as much as to the inert field and to the human mind
 As much as the rest of the universe
 Thus, the first purpose of artificial philosophy was to demonstrate that as natural laws, there is no exception to be able to discover scientific exploration of all the facts of the universe
 jeev-vigyaan, manovigyaan or samajashasre par spencer dwaara likhe gaye sabhi granthon kaa uddeshy in vishisht kshetron main prakritik niyamon ke astitv ko pradarshit karnaa hi tha
 Even in his writings on morality, he held the view that it was possible to find the 'rules' of impermanence, which, despite having normative content, whose state was only the laws of nature, is a concept whose origin Can be seen in Coombe's Constitution of Man
 kritrim darshanashasre kaa doosraa uddeshy yah darshana tha ki yahi niyam anwarat rup se vikaas kii ore le jate hai
 Unlike Comte, who emphasized only the unity of scientific method, Spencer attempted to unify scientific knowledge by decomposing all natural laws into one basic law, the law of origin
 is sandarbh main, unhone edinburgh ke prakaashak robert chembers dwaara unki anaam rachana vestiges of natural history of kriyeshan main prastaavit kiye gaye pratimaan kaa paalan kiya
 Although often dismissed as an ineffective precursor of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species, Chambers' book was actually a program for the integration of science, with the aim of demonstrating that Laplace's origins in the Solar System Both the nebula concept and Lemark's theory of species conversion exemplify 'an amazing generalization of progressive development' It was a battle

 The clearest expression of Spencer's evolutionary approach was first articulated in his essay, 'progress: Its Law and Cause', which was published in 1857 in Chapman's Westminster Review and later the basis of the First Principles of a New System of Philosophy
 Made up
 In it, he explained the theory of evolution, combining information from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's essay 'the Theory of Life' —which itself was derived from Friedrich von Schelling's Naturephilosophy — and generalizing von Baer's law of embryonic development i went
 spencer ne yah vichaar vyakt kiya ki brahmad kii sabhi sanrachanaayen ek saral, samaan, samarupata se ek jatil, bhinn, vividhta main viksit hote hai or vibhinn bhaagon ke bade ekikaran kii prakriya bhi iske saath hi chalati rahati he
 Spencer believed that this evolutionary process could be seen working across the universe
 yah ek saarvbhaumik niyam tha, jo ki taron or akashgangaon par bhi utana hi lagu hota tha, jitna ki jaivik praaniyon par or maanviya saamaajik vyavastha par bhi utana hi lagu hota tha, jitna kii maanav-man par
 yah keval apni vyapak saamanyata ke dwaara hi vaigyanik niyamon se bhinn tha or is siddhant ke udhaaharan ke rup main vishesh vigyaan ke niyam pradarshit kiye ja sakate the
 This attempt to explain the development of complexity was completely different from the one found in Darwin's Origin of Species published two years later
 aksar kaaphi, galat tareeke se, yah mana jaataa he ki spencer ne prakritik chayan par darwin dwaara kiye gaye kaary ko keval hathiyaa liya or samanyikrut kar diya
 lekin, bhale hi darwin ke kaary ko padhane ke baad unhone darwin kii avadharana ke liye apni swayan kii shabdaawalee ke rup main vaakyansh 'sarvshereshth kii uttarjivita ' ko prastut kiya or aksar galat tareeke se unhen ek aisa vichaarak maan liya jaataa he, jisane darvinian siddhant ko samaaj par keval lagu kiya, lekin phir bhi unhone apane sampurna maujuuda tantra main prakritik chayan ko anichhaa se hi shaamil kiya tha
 His primary method of species conversion was the Lamarckist experiment-succession, which posited that organs develop or perish through organ use or application, and that these resulting changes can be transmitted to future generations as well
 spencer kaa maananaa tha ki kramik vikaas kii yah kaary-vidhi 'ucchtar' kramik vikaas kii vyakhya karne ke liye bhi aavashyak thi, visheshtah maanavtaa ke saamaajik vikaas ke liye
 iske alaava, darwin ke vipareet, unka maananaa tha ki kramik vikaas kii ek disha or ek antim-bindu tha, jo ki samatulyata kii prapti kii antim avasthaa he
 He attempted to apply the theory of biological evolution to sociology
 unhone pratipaadit kiya ki samaaj nimnatar se ucchtar roopon main parivartan kaa parinaam he, thik vaise hi jaise yah kaha jaataa he ki jaivik kramik vikaas ke siddhant ke anusaar jivan ke nimnatam rup uchachat roopon main viksit hote hai
 Spencer claimed that the human mind had evolved gradually from the simple automatic reactions of lower animals to the process of reasoning in thoughtful humans
 spencer ke anusaar gyaan ke do prakaar the: vyakti dwaara praapt kiya gaya gyaan tathaa prajati dwaara praapt kiya gaya gyaan
 antargyaan, yaa achetan rup se siikhaa gaya gyaan, prajati kaa vanshaagat anubhav tha
 Spencer studied the original positivist sociology of Auguste Comte with great enthusiasm
 vigyaan ke ek darshanik, comte ne saamaajik-saanskrithik kramik vikaas kaa ek siddhant pratipaadit kiya tha, jiske anusaar samaaj kaa vikaas teen charnon ke ek saamaanya niyam ke dwaara hota he
 However, writing after various changes in biology, Spencer attempted to reconstruct social science in the context of evolutionary biology, rejecting the ideological aspects of Comte's positivism
 mote taur par spencer ke samajashasre kaa varnan saamaajik taur par darvinvaadee ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he 
 Spencer argued that the development of society is an example of the gradual development from simple, equal, homogeneity to complex, different, diversity
 unhone samaaj ke do prakaaron, aatankwaadi tathaa audyogic, kaa ek siddhant viksit kiya, jo ki kramik vikasvaadi pragati ke anuroop tha
 The militant society, whose structure consisted of hierarchical and obedient relations, was simple and uniform; Industrial society, which was based on voluntary, contractually accepted social obligations, was complex and varied
 samaaj, jise spencer ne ek 'saamaajik praani' mana tha, kramik vikaas ke saarvbhaumik niyam ke anusaar saraltar avasthaa se adhik jatil avasthaa main kramik rup se viksit hua
 Furthermore, industrial society was a direct descendant of the ideal society developed in social statistics, although Spencer no longer explicitly expressed whether society would result in anarchism or whether it would have informed a continued role of the state
 Is, however, a role that would have been limited to the minimum functions of enforcement of contracts and external security
 haalanki spencer ne praarambhik samajashasre main kuch moolyawaan yogadan diye, jo ki sanrachanaatmak vyaavhaarikta par unke prabhaav se kam nahin the, lekin saamaajik vigyaan ke kshetra main lemarkwaadi yaa darvinian vichaaron ko prastut karne kaa unka prayaas vifal rahaa

 At the turn of the twentieth century, the first generation of German sociologists, most notably Max Weber, introduced heterodox indirectism
 jaisaa ki spencer kii pehali pustak main purvanumaan kiya gaya he, 'adarsh samaaj main adarsh manushya' kaa nirmaan kramik vikaas kii prakriya kaa antim bindu hoga, jisamen manushya saamaajik jivan ko puri tarah apana chuke honge
 is prakriya ke sandarbh main spencer kii shuruaati or baad vaali avadharanaon ke bich mukhya antar inamen shaamil kramik vikaas kaa samay-maap tha
 The psychological - and hence also moral - structure that has been inherited by our ancestors to the present generation, and which we will pass on to our future generations, was in the process of progressively adopting the needs of residence in society
 udhaaharan ke liye, aakraamakata uttarjivita se judaa ek antargyaan tha, jo jivan kii praathmik sthitiyon ko aavashyak tha, lekin unnat samaajon main ise apnaanaa anaavashyak ho gaya
 chunki maanviya antargyaan kaa mastishk ke utakon ke reshon main vishisht sthaan tha, atah vah prayog-uttaradhikaar kii lemarkwaadi kriyavidhi ke adheen tha, taaki kramik parivartan bhavi pidiyon main sthanantarit kiye ja saken
 anek pidiyon ke bitne ke saath hi, kramik vikaas kii prakriya yah sunishchit karegi ki manushya kam aakraamak or vriddhishil rup se parahitvaadi bane, jiske parinamswaroop antat ek sampurna samaaj kaa nirmaan hoga, jisamen koi bhi vyakti kisi anya vyakti ko dukh nahin pahunchayegaa
 However, in order to build a complete person through gradual development, it was necessary that present and future generations experience the 'natural' consequences of their behavior
 Only in this way will individuals get the necessary motivation to do the work of self-improvement and thus provide an advanced moral formation to their heirs
 Therefore, anything that creates a disruption between the 'natural' relationship of behavior and its consequences must be stopped and this includes the exercise of the state's deterrent power to eradicate poverty, provide public education, or mandate compulsory vaccination
 haalanki, dharmarth daan ko protsaahit kiya janaa tha, lekin use bhi is vichaar ke dwaara simit kiya janaa tha ki manushyon ko dukh aksar unke kaaryon ke parinamswaroop hi praapt hote hai
 Hence, excessive altruism directed towards the 'unqualified poor' of individuals would break the link between behavior and consequences, which Spencer believed to be the basic requirement to ensure that the gradual development of humanity continues at a higher level of development
 spencer ne antim mulya kaa ek upyogvaadi maanak apanaaya-sarvaadhik sankhya kii sarvaadhik prasannataa-or unke anusaar kramik vikaas kii prakriya kaa charambindu upyogita kaa mahattam moolyankan hoga
 adarsh samaaj main rahane vaale vyakti na keval paryaaywad ke abhyaas se anand praapt karenge, balki ve dusron ko dukh pahunchane se bachane kaa bhi prayaas karenge
 ve sahaj rup se dusron ke adhikaron kaa sammaan bhi karenge, jiske parinamswaroop nyaay ke siddhant kaa vaishvik str par paalan kiya jayega-prayek vyakti ke paas swatantraaa kii vah adhiktam maatra hogi, jo dusron ko praapt swatantraaa kii samaan maatra ke saath susangat ho
 'swatantraaa' se aashay avapeedan kii anupasthiti se tha or yah nijee sampatti ke adhikaar se gaharaai se judi hui thi
 Spencer called this law of conduct 'ultimate ethics', which provided a scientifically grounded system of ethics that would replace the supernatural-based ethics systems of the past
 However, he recognized that the moral formation we inherited does not yet allow us to deal in full conformity with the laws of ultimate ethics and that is why we need a rule of 'relative ethics' In which the distortive factors of our present imperfection have also been considered
 sangieshasre par spencer kaa vishisht drushtikon bhi unke nitishasre se judaa hua tha
 Spencer thought that the origins of music can be traced to the eloquent oratory
 vaktaa pratyayakari prabhaav daalate hai, na keval unke shabdon kii tarkshiltaa ke dwaara, balki unke lahaze or swaraghaat ke dwaara bhi-jaisaa ki spencer ne ise vyakt kiya, unke swar ke sangitamay gun "buddhi ke vaakyon par bhaawanaaon kii tippanee" ke rup main kaary karte hai
 Music, considered to be an advanced development of his characteristic of oratory, contributes to the education and development of ethics of the species
 "hamaare bheetar dhun or lay se prabhavit hone kii jo vicitra kshamta he, main shaayad ye donon baaten nihit hai ki un ativ prasantaaon kaa ahsaas kar paanaa hamaare swabhaav kii sambhaavnaaon ke bheetar he, tathaa yah ki kisi na kisi tareeke se ve unki prastuti se sambandhit hai
 If so, the power and meaning of music become perceptible; But otherwise they are a mystery
 " In Spencer's final years his initial optimism appeared to be eroding and was replaced by a pessimism about the future of humans
 iske baavjood, unhone apana adhiktam prayaas apane tarkon kaa samarthan karne or gaiyr-hastkshep ke unke mahatvapurn siddhant kii galat-vyakhya ko rokane hetu samarpit kar diya
 Spencer's reputation among the Victorians is largely attributed to his agnosticism
 unhone dharamshasre ko 'dharmanishtha kaa dikhaava karne waalon kii naastikta' kaa pratinidhi kahkar asweekaar kar diya
 paramparaagat dharm ko asweekaar kar dene ke kaaran unhen atyadhik kuprasiddhi mili or aksar dharmik chintakon ne anishvarwad va bhautikwaad kaa samarthak hone kaa aarope lagaakar unki ninda kii
 iske baavjood huxley, jinka agyeyavaad 'vishwaas ke ek akshamya paap' kii ore ek kendrit aatanki sampradaay tha, ke vipareet spencer ne is baat par bal diya ki ve vigyaan ke naam par dharm kaa avamulyan kiye jane se nahin, balki in donon ke bich saamanjasy sthapit karne ko lekar chintit the
 Spencer argued that whether we start with religious belief or with science, eventually we have to accept some essential, but literally unthinkable assumptions
 chaahe ham kisi nirmaataa ke prati chintit hon yaa us adhbstar ke prati, jo tathyon ke hamaare anubhav ke neeche sthit he, ham isaki sankalpana kaa koi khaakaa nahin khinch sakate
 spencer kaa nishkarsh tha ki isiliye, dharm or vigyaan is param satya ko sweekaar karte hai ki maanviya samaj keval 'saapeksh' gyaan ko samaj paane main hi sakasham he
 This is because, due to the inherent limitations of the human mind, it is only possible to gain knowledge of the facts, not the reality below the facts
 Therefore, both science and religion should accept that 'of all the facts, it is most certain that the power we see in the universe, and is completely inaccessible
 ' ise unhone 'agyeya' kaa bodh kaha or unhone agyeya kii upasna ko paaramparik dharm kaa sthaan lene main sakasham sakaaratmak vishwaas ke rup main prastut kiya
 In fact, he was of the view that the agnostic represents the final stage in the gradual development of religion, the final removal of its final anthropomorphic remains

 He has been vindicated by libertarians and stateless capitalism

 Spencer argued that the state is not a "necessary" institution and would "decay" if the oppressive aspects of the state were replaced by the voluntary market organization
 He also argued that the individual had "the right to ignore the state

 When he was told that British forces were in a state of disarray during the Second Afghan War, he said in response: "when people shoot others at the behest of others, without asking anything about the appropriateness of their movement They give themselves on rent and if they are shot on their own, i wouldn't worry about it

 The expression 'there is no alternative', which was brought to prominence by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, can be traced to its strenuous use by Spencer

 According to a review of the JSTOR English-language database, the terminology "social Darwinism" was first used in an English-language academic journal in a book review of 1895 by Frank Tossig, a Harvard economist
 The data of JSTOR suggest that this term was used only 21 times before 1931

 The twentieth century was opposed to Spencer

 unki mrityu ke aadhi sadi baad unke kaary ko "darshaniktaa kii nakal " kahkar khaarij kar diya gaya, or itihaaskaar richard hofstader ne unhen "swanirmit buddhi kaa tatvvaadi or craikar-bairal agyeyavaadee paigambar qaraar diya
" phir bhi, spencer ke vichaar victorian kaal main itani gaharaai tak utar chuke the ki unka prabhaav puri tarah samaapt nahin hua
 However, in the last part of the twentieth century much positive estimates have been generated

 Despite his image as a social Darwinist, Spencer's political views have been interpreted in many ways
 unka rajnatik darshanashasre, donon prakaar ke logon, ek jo yah maanate the ki vyakti swayan apane bhagya ke swami hote hai, va unhen ek hastkshepavaadi rajya ke kisi dakhal ko nahin sahanaa chaiye, tathaa duusare ve jo ye maanate the ki saamaajik vikaas ke liye ek shaktishaalee kendriya shakti kaa hona aavashyak he, ko prerana di

 Arguing against the majority's view that the "right to free contract" is reflected in the Appropriate Procedure Section of the Fourteenth Amendment, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr
 wrote: "the Fourteenth Amendment does not meet the social statics of Mr
 Herbert Spencer
" Spencer had been described as a semi-agnostic as well as a full-agnostic
 marxvaadi siddhantkaar georgy plekhanov ne apni 1909 kii pustak anarkism and socialism main spencer ko ek "rudhiwaadi agyeyavaadee " kaha
 Spencer's ideas became very effective in China and Japan, a big reason being that he attracted the reformers' desire to establish a powerful nation-state that could compete with Western powers
 His ideas were introduced by the Chinese scholar Yen Fu, who felt his writing was a recipe for the reform of the Qing state
 spencer ne japani paashchaatyawadee tukotumi soho ko bhi prabhavi kiya, jinka maananaa tha ki japan ek "aatankwaadi samaaj" se ek "audyogic samaaj" kii ore sankraman kii kagaar par tha or yah aavashyak tha vah sheeghra hi sabhi japani baton ko phenk de or pashchimi nitishasre va shiksha ko apana le

 Spencer also had a great influence on literature and oratory
 In his 1852 essay, "the Philosophy of Style", a growing trend of the formist type of writing was discovered
 kisi angrezi vaakya ke bhaagon ke upyukt sthaan va kram par atyadhik kendrit rahete hue unhone prabhavi lekhan ke liye ek maargdarshika kii rachana kii
 spencer kaa uddeshy gadhy lekhan ko yathasambhav "gharshan va niskriyata" se mukt karnaa tha, taaki upyukt sandarbh tathaa kisi vaakya ke arth ke sambandhit shramsadhy vichaar-vimarsh ke kaaran pathak kii gati dhimi na pad jaae
 spencer ne tark diya ki lekhak kaa adarsh "vichaaron ko is prakaar prastut karnaa he, taaki pathak unhen nunatam sambhav maansik prayaas ke dwaara samaj sake
" He argued that by making the meaning as accessible as possible, the writer would achieve the highest possible communicative efficiency
 According to Spencer, this can be done by placing all the clauses, objects and phrases before the subject of a sentence, so that by the time the reader reaches the subject, they have already had all the information necessary to fully understand its significance
 Although the overall impact of "genre philosophy" on the field of oratory was not as widespread as his contributions to other fields, Spencer's tone lent effective support to the metaphorical approaches to oratory
 spencer kaa sahitya par bhi prabhaav tha or anek upanyaaskaaron va laghu-katha lekhakon ne unke vichaaron ko apni kritiyon main sthaan diya
 jorge iliyat, liyo tolstoy, thomas hardi, boleslau prus, ebraham kaahan, di

 arnald benet ne first principles kii atyadhik prashansa kii or benet par iske prabhaav ko unke anek upanyaason main dekha ja saktaa he
 Jack London also created a character named Martin Aden, a staunch Spencerist
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki antone chekhov ke naatak da thri sisters main "varshinin" kaa paatr ek samarpit spencervaadi he
 Hg Wells used Spencer's ideas as the subject of his short novel, The Time Machine, and was applied to explain the gradual evolution of humans as two species
 Perhaps the best example of Spencer's ideas and influence of writing is that his reach was so diverse
 unhone na keval apane samaaj ke aantarik kriyakalapon ko aakaar pradaan karne vaale prashaskon ko prabhavit kiya, balki un samaajon ke aadarshon va vishwaason ko aakaar dene main sahaayta karne vaale kalakaaron ko bhi prabhavit kiya

 Holmes's birth in the story His Last Bow is estimated around 1854; Generally, the date is quoted as 6 January

 Since 1881, the description is that 221B Baker Street, London, was the home of Holmes from where he runs his own private detective agency
 221B satraa kadam upar ek flats he jise ek puraani pandulipi main sadak kaa "upree chor" kaha gaya he
 By the time Dr
 Watson arrived, Holmes worked alone, rarely employing agents from a small section of the city, with a large number of informants and a group of market children whom he called the Baker Street Irregulars
 irregulars teen kahaniyon main dikhaai dete hai, "da sin of da four", "a study in skarlet" or "da adventure of da crucked main"
 Holmes's family is rarely described

 homes ke anya bhai-bahan hai yaa nahin yah spasht nahin he
 In "the Adventure of the Copper Beaches", Holmes says, "I confess that this is not the situation in which i would like to see my sister", which makes some people anticipate her existence

 homes kii zyaadaatar kahaniyaan ghatnatmak kathan hai, jo jasoos ke sarvaadhik dilachasp maamalon ke saransh ke rup main watasan ke drushtikon se likhi gai hai
 Holmes has often been referred to Watson's writings as sensational and populist, suggesting that the articles do not present unbiased and accurate reports of pure calculative "science" of his art
 phir bhi, watasan ke saath homes kii dosti nihsandeh uskaa sabase mahatvapurn rishta he
 In many stories, Holmes' affection for Watson — often hidden behind his cold, intellectual outward appearance — is exposed
 "da adventure of da thri garidebs main, ek khalanaayak ke saath takaraav main watasan ghayal ho jaataa he; haalanki goli kaa ghaav "bahut satahi" siddh hota he, watasan homes kii pratikriya se aahlaadit ho jaataa he: In total, Holmes has been described as working actively for twenty-three years, during which Watson wrote seventeen of his cases
 homes 1903-04 main ritair hokar sasex douns ke ek madhumakhi farm main chalaa jaataa he jahaan vah madhumakhi paalan ke shauk ko apane praathmik vyavsaay ke rup main letaa he or antat "practical hand book of bi culture, wyeth sam obsarveshns apon da segrigeshan of da queen" pesh karata he
 Only one case, described by Holmes himself and which he was investigating as an amateur, occurs during the detective's retirement
 homes ne aadaton or jivan-style ke maamle main khud ko "fakkad" ke rup main varnit kiya he
 According to Watson, Holmes is an eccentric who has no connection with contemporary standards of cleanliness or orderliness
 ek praarambhik kahani main, watasan, homes kaa is prakaar varnan karata he: What others find to be chaos is what Holmes sees as a repository of useful information
 kahaniyon main homes, betaratib kaagazaat or kalakritiyon ke apane bikhare jaal main dubkee laga kar bilkul vishisht dastauez yaa anya koi vastu jisaki use talash he, khoj nikaalata he
 In terms of personal hygiene, by contrast, Holmes is described in "the Hound of the Baskervilles" as a "cat-like" lover of personal cleanliness
 kisi bhi rup main yah uske peshey ke nitant vyaavhaarik anugaman main baadha utpann karata hua prathit nahin hota, tathaapi; homes kii pehali kahani,"a study in skarlet" main uske haath acid ke daag se gande ho gaye hai, jabaki baad main homes apane hi khun kii buundon kaa upyog rasinic prayog ke liye karata he
 Watson often marks Holmes's uncertain eating habits
 gahan bauddhik gatividhi ke samay jasoos dwaara aksar khud ko bhookha rakhane kaa varnan he, jaisaa ki da adventure of da norwood builder" ke dauraan, jahaan watasan ke anusaar: Holmes's historian does not mind his habit of using pipes, or his relatively little use of cigarettes and cigars
 Nor does Watson condemn Holmes's readiness to turn a truth or break a law where he believes Is that it is morally justified
 homes ko ek deshbhakt ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya he, jo kai kahaniyon main rashtriya suraksha ke maamalon main sarkaar kii taraf se kaam kar rahaa he
 He also serves as a counter-intelligence in His Last Bow which is located at the beginning of WWI
 shooting abhyaas ke rup main, jasoos ne apane baker street thikaane kii diwaar ko apni pistaul kii goliyon se banaae "VR" ke nishaan se sajaayaa he
 Holmes's pride sometimes takes the form of pride; Although with justification; He enjoys pleasing police inspectors with his excellent conclusions
 use prasiddhi kii ichha nahin he or vah aam taur par apane kaary ke liye police ko saarvajanik rup se shrey lene kii anumati dekar santusht rahata he
 It is often that when Watson publishes his stories, Holmes's role in the case becomes clear
 homes ke aacharan ko tatasth or thanda prastut kiya gaya he
 Yet in the midst of an adventure, with remarkable passion, Holmes can show the sparkle
 uski pravriti main pradarshnakarita he or ek apradhi ko pakadaney or uski kalai kholane ke liye vah vyapak jaal taiyaar karata he, aksar watasan yaa scotland yard nirikshakon main se ek ko prabhavit karne ke liye
 Holmes occasionally uses drugs, especially when there is a shortage of excitatory cases
 vah cocaine kaa aadi he, jise ek saat pratishat ke ghol main ek vishesh sui ke prayog se jise vah ek chamade ke khol main rakhata he, chubhota he
 Holmes also uses opium occasionally, but expresses his disapproval when he visits an opium base
 19veen sadi ke uttarardh main sabhi teen, england main jaays the
 By showing no medical objection to Holmes' drug use, Dr
 Watson depicts the Victorian medical fanatic
 naitik rup se, vah apane dost kii aadat kii, ise jasoos kii "ekmaatr buraai" bataate hue ninda karte hai or homes ke maansik swasthya or utkrisht buddhi par iske sambhavit asar ko lekar chintaa vyakt karte hai
 In later narratives, Watson claims to have removed Holmes from drugs
 phir bhi, uske chikitsak mitra ke anusaar, homes ek nashedi bana rahata he jisaki aadat "mari nahin, balkee keval so rahi thi
 " haalanki shuru main use 221B baker street main apane aaramdaayak nivas ke kiraye ko saajha karne ke liye watasan kii jarurat rahati he, "da adventure of da daaing detective" main watasan khulaasa karte hai, jab homes akelaa rahata tha tab "mujhe koi andeh nahin he ki ghar ko shaayad us keemat par kharida gaya hoga jo homes apane kamare ke liye bhugtan karata he," yah ingit karte hue ki usne apane vyavhaar se ek acchhee aay utpann kii, haalanki yah thik se kabhi nahin pataa chalaa ki vah apni sevaaon ke liye kitna shulk letaa he
 He says in "the Problem of Thor Bridge" that "my professional fee is at a certain level
 main unhen badalata nahin hum, sirf jab main unhen puri tarah maaf kar detaa hum 


 " This is stated in a context when a customer offered him twice his fee; However, it is possible that wealthy clients provide Holmes with much higher remuneration than his standard fee: In "the Adventure of the Final Problem", Holmes states that the government of France and the royal residence of Scandinavia gave him sufficient money for his services
 So that he can retire comfortably, while Watson in "the Adventure of Black Peter" indicates that Holmes refuses to help the rich and powerful He would have paid taxes if he did not like their case, whereas he devoted a whole week's time to the affairs of highly polite customers
 "a cese of aaidentity" main homes, watasan ko yah bhi bataata he ki "a scandle in bohemia" ke baad, bohemia ke raja ne use ek sunaharaa sunghni dibba diya or dach shahi parivaar se use ek shandaar anguthi mili; "da adventure of da bruce- partington plance" main homes ko ek panna nirmit taai-pin maharani victoria se praapt hota he
 Other mementoes of Holmes' cases are a gold guinea from Irene Adler and a signed thank-you letter from the President of France and the Legion of Honor The Adventure of the Golden pins-nez "the Adventure of the" for capturing an assassin named Huert "holmes rubs his hands with glee" at the Primary School when the Duke of Holderness writes to Zodiac, which also surprises Watson and then Che
 The pats, saying that "I am a poor man," an event that could be dismissed as a tendency toward ironic humor that Holmes
 nishchit rup se, apane karier ke dauraan homes ne sabase shaktishaalee raajaaon or europe kii sarkaron or vibhinn amir kulinon or udyogpatiyon donon ke liye kaam kiya or garib sahukaaron or samaaj ke nichle paaydaan kii vinamr adhyapikaon dwaara salaah ke liye bhi usase sampark kiya gaya
 Holmes, for his expenses, charges money from customers and can claim any reward offered to solve the problem: he says in "the Adventure of the Speckled Band" that Miss Stoner could pay the expenses she incurred
 And requests that "the red-headed League" bank compensate for the expenses incurred on the case
 "holmes has his wealthy banker client to pay the costs incurred in retrieving the stolen gems in The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet, and he also claims the reward that banker announced for the finder Was
 homes ko prabhavit karne vaali ekmaatr mahila thi ireni edler, jo homes dwaara hameshaa "vah aurat" ke rup main sambodhit kii gai
 Holmes himself is not quoted using the term directly — even though he takes his real name several times in other cases
 edler un chand mahilaon main se ek he jo homes kii tamaam kahaniyon main uddhrut kii gayi hai, haalanki vah vastav main keval ek hi kahani, "a scandle in bohemia" main vyaktigat rup se upasthit hoti he
 In one story, "the Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton" becomes Holmes' match for the wedding, but only with the desire to gather information for his case
 He shows a clear interest in the way a lot of attractive female clients get in the way
 ,
 Holmes essentially "showed no further interest in her client when she moved out of the center of one of her problems
" " homes ne unke yauvan, saundarya or urja ko kisi bhi romani hit se alag, anupranit karne vaala paaya
 Such episodes reflect Holmes' fascination, yet there is no sign of any serious or long-term attachment, except in the case of Adler
 watasan ne likhaa he ki homes ko "mahilaon se ghrinaa" he lekin " saath anugrah paane kaa ek vicitra tarika he" homes kahata he,"main stri jati kaa purna man se prashansak nahin hum"; vastav main vah paata he "mahilaon kii manshaa 


 itani gudh

 " haalanki, doyal ne joseph bel ko yaad karte hue kaha," homes babes gananaa mashin kii tarah hi amaanush he or pyaar main padane kii puri sambhaavna ke saath he
 " mahilaon ke saath homes ke sambandh kaa ek or dilachasp pahalu yah he ki unki sangat se use jo anand praapt hota he uskaa strot unke dwaara laai gai samasyaayein hai
 In Sign of the Four, Watson cites Holmes as "a human being, a calculating machine," and Holmes is quoted as saying, "it is most important, to make his decisions by personal qualities Should not be allowed to be prejudiced
 a client is just one unit for me - a factor in the problem
 Emotional qualities are opposed to clear logic
 main aapako vishwaas dilaataa hum ki aaj tak jis aurat ko sabase aakarshak aurat maine paaya use beemaa ke paise ke liye teen chote bacchon ko jehar dene ke jurm main faansee par lataka diya gaya
 

 "it refers to Holmes' reluctance to make connections with women in general and with the client in particular, as Watson said" Sometimes you see a positive inhumanity in you
 " "da adventure of da davills foot" ke ant main homes kahata he:"maine kabhi pyaar nahin kiya watasan, par agar main karata or yadi us aurat kaa jise main pyaar karata, uskaa ant aisa hota, to shaayad main apane swechhachari sher ke shikari kii tarah vyavhaar karata

 "da adventure of da daaing detective main watasan likhata he ki shrimati hadsan apane hi tareeke se homes ko pasand karatin hai, ek kiraayedaar ke rup main uski jhanjhati sanakeepan ke baavjood, mahilaon ke saath uske ullekhneey namr or shisht vyavhaar ke kaaran
" da sin of da four main ek baar phir watasan, homes ko yah kehete hue uddhrut karata he,"main unhen bahut zyada nahin bataaungaa
 mahilaon par kabhi puri tarah se vishwaas nahin karnaa chahie,-- unamem se sabase acchhee par bhi nahin
" watasan likhata he ki jab ki vah unhen naapsand or un par avishvaas karata he, phir bhi vah ek "udaar virdohi" he
 Holmes's primary intellectual investigative method is the permissible logic of solving a crime "with a drop of water", he writes, "that a logical person can guess the probability of the Atlantic or Niagara without seeing one or hearing the other
" Holmes's stories often begin with a display of the courageous talent of his "permissiveness"
 yah tarkikon or tark main ruchi rakhane waalon ke liye thodaa ruchikar he ki ve vishleshan karne kaa prayaas karen ki apni anumiti ke dauraan homes kya kar rahaa he
 Homogeneous permission appears to be constructed from conclusions that are primarily based on either straightforward, plausible principles that are the result of cautious inductive studies such as Holmes's study of various types of cigar ashes or the best explanation Is the conclusion
 homes ke sidhe-sapaat vyaavhaarik siddhanton kaa swarup aam taur par,"agar 'p', to 'q', hota he jahaan 'p' drishyman saboot he or 'q' vah he jo saboot ingit karata he
 But there are intermediate principles as well, as can be seen in the following example
 "a scandle in bohemia" main homes anumiti karata he ki watasan haal hi main bahut bhigaa hua tha or uski "jo naukaraani ladki thi vah bahut hi foohad or laaparvaah thi"
jab vismit hokar watasan poochta he ki homes yah baat kaise jaanata he to homes jawaab detaa he: In this case, Holmes used several associated theories: spasht dhang se aise siddhant lagu karke homes yah anumaan lagane main sakasham he ki: "the edges of Watson's shoes are strewn with parallel erosion"; From "watson's maid is clumsy and careless"; And "watson has been very wet lately and went out in dirty weather
 " Permissive arguments enable Holmes to effectively disclose a stranger's occupation, such as a retired sergeant of the Marines in a Study in Scarlett; The former carpenter of a ship in the Red-headed League who became a Mahajan; And a billiard-marker and an artillery retired NCO in The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter
 Similarly, by studying inanimate objects, Holmes is able to draw surprisingly detailed conclusions about their owners, including Watson's pocket-watch in The Sign of the Four, as well as other stories containing a cap, a pipe, And a stick
 ek baar usne dher saare saboot jamaa kiye or sambhav vyakhyaaon kii anumiti kii or ek samaadhaan prastut karne ke liye homes us ek vyakhya kii taraf badhata he jo is maamle ke sabhi tathyon se mail khaati he
 As Holmes tells Watson, "when you have removed the impossible, whatever is left, however unlikely, must be true
" homes abhinay or chhadam vesh banane main gahari ruchi pradarshit karata he
 In many stories, he bears such a natural disguise to gather evidence that even Watson does not catch him, as in "the Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton", in The Man with the Twisted Lip and a Scandal in Bohemia
 In other exploits, Holmes pretends to be injured or sick to make his case effective, or to blame those involved, such as "the Adventure of the Dying Detect The Tiv "
 pistaul homes or watasan apane saath pistaul rakhte hai; watasan ke maamle main aksar uski puraani sarvice revolver
 However, Watson only discusses the use of these weapons on seven occasions

 In "gloria Scott" it is reiterated that Holmes is trained as a boxer

 " "baritsu" naam, vaastavik-jivan ke marshall art bartitsu ke liye ek sandarbh prathit hota he
 In the very first story a Study in Scarlet, something about Holmes's background is given
 1881 ke purvardh main, use rasayan vigyaan ke ek swatantra chaatr ke rup main pesh kiya gaya he jisaki kai vividh jigyaasu ruchiyan hai, jisamen se lagbhag sabhi ekanishtha hokar use aparaadhon ko sulajhane main behatar banane ke rup main prakat huin

homes vaigyanik tareeke kaa kadai se paalan karata he or tarkon or prekshan or anumiti kii shakti par jor detaa he
 In a Study in Scarlett, Holmes claims that he does not know that the Earth revolves around the Sun, since such information is irrelevant to his work
 pratyaksh rup se watasan se yah tathy sunne ke baad, vah kahata he ki vah turant use bhuulane kii koshish karegaa
 vah kahata he ki uskaa maananaa he ki jaankaree ko sangrahit karne ke liye mastishk kii ek simit kshamta he or isliye nirarthak baaten seekhney se uski upyogi chijen seekhney kii kshamta keval kam hi hogi
dow watasan baad main homes kii kshamta kaa akalan is prakaar karata he: Even at the end of a Study in Scarlet, it is shown that Holmes knows Latin and that there is no need for translation of the original Roman proverbs, although the direct utility of language knowledge for espionage work is doubtful
 baad kii kathaayen bhi suchi kaa khandan karti hai
 Despite the possible ignorance of Holmes's politics, in "A Scandal in Bohemia" he immediately realizes the true identity of the so-called "count von Krum"
 gaiyr-sansanikhej sahitya ke sambandh main, uskaa bhaashan bible, shakespeare, yahaan tak ki goethe ke sandarbhon se paripurna he
 In addition, in The Adventure of the bruce-partington Plans, Watson informs that in November 1895, "holmes immerses himself in a monopoly he took from the Polyteous Mottes of Lasas" - a highly esoteric field, for which Holmes Will have to unravel his memory with a vast store of information, which has nothing to do with the fight of crime - such a broad knowledge that his disobedience has to be Year is considered "final word" on

 His methods include the use of latent prints such as footprints and hoof prints and cycle tracks to identify action at a crime scene, the use of tobacco ashes and cigarette turrets to identify criminals, a fraud bust
 To compare type letters, use gunpowder residue to expose two murderers ", compare bullets obtained from two crime sites and Even the earliest use of fingerprints
 In a Scandal in Bohemia, Holmes also demonstrates his knowledge of psychology, where he lures Irene Adler into cheating him about the picture hiding, which rests on this "premise
" That an unmarried woman would want her most precious thing in the event of a fire while a married woman would pounce on her child
 In the first story, a Study in Scarlet, apane jivan kii uttejnaa ke baavjood homes sevanivrutt hokar madhumakhi paalan karne sasex downs chale jate hai or is vishay par ek pustak likhte hai,"practical hand book of bi culture, wyeth sam obsarveshns apon da segrigeshan of da queen

 Although Sherlock Holmes is not the original novel Detective, his name has become a quote
 uski kahaniyon main kai jasusi kahani alankaar shaamil hai jaise, vafaadaar lekin kam budhimaan sahaayak, ek bhoomika jiske liye dow watasan adarsh ban gaya he
 Sherlock Holmes has sometimes been used in scientific literature
 redford uski prabuddhata par vichaar karte hai
 Using Conan Doyle's stories as data, Redford estimates Sherlock Holmes' IQ in three different ways and concludes that his intelligence is indeed very high
 snidar 19veen sadi ke madhya or uttarardh ke vigyaan or aparaadhashastra ke prakaash main homes ke tareekon kii jaanch karte hai

 They throw light on aspects of Doyle's books that are currently favorable about expertise, aspects that are inconceivable and aspects that suggest further research

 Early scholars of this law include Ronald Knox of Britain and Christopher Morley of New York
 shradhanjali swaroop, kam athwa adhik maatra main lekhakon ne sherl homes, conan doyal, yaa kahaniyon ke paatro se kai pop samskruti sandarbh nirmit kiye hai
 Such cues serve to develop a plot, increase the intellectual level of the part or treat it as an Easter egg for an observant audience

 The simplest reference is often to give anyone who does any kind of espionage work, wearing a hunting hat and cloak
 Another rich area in terms of pop culture is the ancestry and descendants of Holmes, but really the writer's imagination is the only limit

 Holmes's fan period from 1891 to 1894 — the time between Holmes's disappearance and possible death in The Adventure of the Final Problem and then the reappearance in "the Adventure of the Adventure of the Empty House—" "as mentioned
 haalanki yah ullekhneey he, ki baad main ek kahani ke 1892 main ghatit hone kaa varnan he
 Conan Doyle wrote the first set of stories over the course of a decade
 Desiring to devote more time to his historical novels, he killed Holmes in "the Final Problem", published in 1893
 Facing eight years of public pressure After doing so, the author wrote The Hound of the Baskervilles, published in 1901, vaguely establishing it before Holmes' "death"
 Although the public was pleased with the story, she was not satisfied with a posthumous Holmes and so Conan Doyle revived Holmes after two years

 Some authors have given other explanations for the interval
 meyer ke upanyaas da seven-par-saint salution main, antaraal ko gupt vishram diwas ke rup main dikhaaya gaya he jab homes sigmund frid ke haathon se cocaine kii lat kaa ilaaj karwaata he or homes ko prasannchit suzav dete hue prastut kiya he ki watasan yah daawa karte hue ki vah moriarti dwaara maaraa gaya he, ek kaalpanik vivaran prastut karenge or logon ke bare main yah kahenge ki,"ve kisi bhi haalat main tumhaara kabhi vishwaas nahin karenge
" In his memoirs Conan Doyle quotes a reader who declared the earlier stories to be superior to the latter, for the reason that Holmes may have been killed when he went to the Raishenbach falls, rather than ever before
 Not the same
 Holmes's differences between pre and post-interval rather actually led to speculation among those who played "the Great Game"
 In more fictional theories, Mark Bourne's story "the Case of the Detectives Smile" was published in the poetry compilation Sherlock Holmes in Orbit, which estimates that one of the places Holmes visited during his hiatus was Alice's Wonderland
 While living there, he solved a case of stolen samosas and his experiences there contributed to the extermination of his cocaine addiction

 saanchaa:holmesnovelssazca:conan Doyle Mahatma Vidur is well known by the great men who explained the proper policy of the responsibilities of the king and the subjects in the behavior of life in the Hindu texts

 Duryodhana's obstinacy was against

 The day had returned when Sanjay returned
 maharaj dhritarashtra yudhisthir se hui baatcheet kaa byora jaanane ke liye utsuk the
 While Sanjay was of the opinion that if all the things are done in front of everyone in the Rajya Sabha the next day, it would be better
 yahi sochakar sanjay maharaj dhritarashtra ko santvanaa dekar ghar laut gaya
 Maharaj Dhritarashtra was rising
 sanjay ne koi baat unhen spasht rup se nahin bataai thi
 The subject of his concern was Yudhishthira's decision
 vastav main maharaj dhritarashtra anishchay se ghir gaye the
 It was very difficult to say what news Sanjay has brought from Yudhishthira
 The thief of his mind had disturbed him
 prashn yah tha ki—vah apane man kii dasha kis ke saamne prakat karen? or antatah is anishchay or shankaa kii ghadi main vah apane param athmiya vidura ko hi yaad karte hai
 Vidur warned Maharaj Dhritarashtra at the time of the gaming game that if this game is not finished then it will be a disaster
 hastinapur vinaash ke kagaar par jane se nahin batch paaegaa or maharaj bhautik rup se netraheene hote hue bhi dekh nahin paa rahe the, vidura ke samajhane par bhi nahin samaj paae
 That son could not be freed from the temptation
 unhen anubhav ho gaya—yah din to aana hi tha
 Before the foundation stone of Mahavinash was laid, Dhritarashtra called Vidur to discuss and discuss with him and Vidur's mention of the role of Maharaj Dhritarashtra to make him aware of his responsibility was the only sermon actually given by Maharishi Vedavas in 'mahabharata' Described as 'vidur Niti' in Udyog Parva
 vidura ek tarah se hastinapur raaj-parivaar kaa sadsy hokar hi daasi putr ke naate adhikaar-rup main kuch bhi kah paane kii dasha main nahin the
 It was the influence of the royalty's grace and Vidur's neutral truth-setting, knowledge and interest in religion that despite being ordinary, he always received special respect
 bhishma, mata satyavati, dhritarashtra apane jeevankaal tak pandu, yudhisthir aadi bhai, krishna, gandhari, kunti or acharya dron, kripacharya aadi sabhi unako yathochit maan-sammaan detethe
 Maharaja Shantanu's attachment to Satyavati, the Nishad daughter of Hastinapur, and the condition of Nishad in his marriage that only Satyavati's son would be the crown prince, this hurt Mahant Shantanu
 vah ganga-putr devvrat ke adhikaar ko kaise daanv par laga sakate the ? ganga-putr devvrat ne pita kii chintaa kaa kaaran jaanakar swayan nishadaraaj ke samaksh pratigya kii ki ‘nishadaraaj ! tumhaari kanya ke garbh se utpann putr hi hastinapur ke rajya kaa uttaradhikari hoga
 Nishadraj's skepticism did not end at this point also
 unhone kaha, ‘‘yadi tumhaara putr meri satyavati ke putr se rajya chin le ? devvrat ne yah aashay jaanakar kaha, ‘nishadaraaj main ajanm brahmacharya kaa paalan karne kaa bhishmavrat letaa hoon
 On hearing this, Nishadraj did not object to the marriage of his Rajakanya Satyavati with Maharaj Shantanu

 After Bhishma's pledge of Prince Devavrata, 'devavrata was left behind somewhere, remained confined in the inner room and remained Bhishma

 His attachment to his son Devavrata had to be paid so much

 Both the princes could not even be full-fledged that Maharaj Shantanu went to heaven

 Maharaja Chitrangad died at the hands of Gandharva Raj in a battle

 On the orders of Mother Satyavati, Bhishma himself rode the chariot and traveled to Kashi

 In anger, Bhishma kidnapped the three girls and brought them to Hastinapur
 unhone teenon kanyaayein vicitra veery ko samarpit kar deen
 The wedding was arranged
 yah dekhakar kaashi naresh kii badi kanya ne unhen bataaya-vah man-hi-man kaushal naresh maharaj shalve ko apana pati maan chuki he to bhishma ne unhen sevakon ke saath shalve ke yahan pahunchaa diya or ambika tathaa ambalika kaa vivaah vichitraveery se kar diya gaya
 Who could have avoided Honi? When the gentle feelings of virtuous Devavrata were presented at the altar of Hastinapur state, then Queen Satyavati also had to pay some value for it
 is tarah chitrangad to avivaahit hi sansar se vidaa hue or vichitraveery bhi yovanonmad main unmatta kamaskt kshay rog se grast ho gayi or asamay hi nihsantaan swarg sidhaar gaye
 Wishing a healthy child, Satyavati made another attempt and sent Ambalaika to Vyasji's room this time
 ambalika vyasaji ke krishnaroop ko dekhakar bhay se pili pad gai
 As a result Rugan Pandu was born
 satyavati kii samasya kaa samaadhaan abhi bhi nahin hua tha
 So once there was an idea to send Ambika back to Vyas ji's shelter
 ambika is baar jane ko taiyaar na hui
 He instead sent his handmaid to Vyasji's shelter
 is daasi ne hi vyasaji ke dwaara vidura ko janm diya
 In fact, Dharmaraja incarnated as Vidur from the curse of Mahatma Mandavya, this is also a former affair

 Sunil Chhetri is a famous Indian footballer of Nepali origin
 vah abhi ai - lig main banglur footbal club ke liye khelte hai or is team ke captain bhi he
 Sunil Chhetri was born on 3 August 1984 from the womb of Nepali parents in a place called Secunderabad, Andhra Pradesh
 unki mata or do bahanon ne nepal kii mahila team se footbal khelaa tha
 Perhaps this is why he was interested in football since childhood
 unke pita bhartiya sena main ek gorkha jawan kii naukari karte the or unka sthaanantaran bahut jaldi hota tha parantu isse sunil ko koi fark nahin padaa
 He was only a football enthusiast
 17 saal ke aayu main sunil ne apana footbal jivan dilli shahar main 2001 main shuru kiya
 a year later, Mohun Bagan immediately realized his talent and included him
 us din se sunil ke peshewar footbal jivan kaa aarambh hua or phir kya tha usne kabhi peeche mood ke kabhi nahin dekha
 Sunil has also played in both the junior and senior categories for the Bhartia team
 vah abhi bhartiya team ke captain he
 In 2007, his 2 goals against Cambodia made him feel like he made a hero in one night
 puure vishwa ne unki pratibha ko dekha or uski saraahna kii
 After scoring 3 goals in the AFC Challenge Cup 2008 against Tajikistan, he got India to the Asia Cup after 27 years
 itani safaltaa paane ke baad unhe duusare deshon se footbal khilne ke liye ofer aane lage
 There were also rumors that he could play in the English Premier League but could not play for any reason
 sunil ne 2010 main consaas city ke liye major lig soker uese main khilne ke liye gayi
 He became the third Indian to have played outside India
 2012 main unhone sporting club di portugal ke reserves team kii taraf se khelaa
 There too, he won the hearts of all with his good game
 sporting club di portugal ke saath anubandh khatm hote hi unho ne bangalore footbal club ke saath anubandh kar liya
 He is currently the captain of the club and by his game the team is currently the number one player of the i-league
 unhone abhi tak india team kii taraf se 72 match main 41 gol daag chuke he
 This is the highest score an Indian has ever scored
 sunil ne bharat ko 2007, 2009, 2012 main nehru cap jeeta rakhaa he or 2008 main asia cap ke liye kwalifai bhi karavaaya tha
 There is no doubt that he is the best player of India
 arujan puraskaar bhi sunil jeet chuke hai
 NDTV India gave him the Player of the Year award in 2007 and has also won the IIFA Player of the Year award three times
 ye sab puraskaar bataate hai ki aisa karnama koi aam khilaadi nahin balki ek pratibhavan khilaadi hi kar saktaa he
 Surely Sunil Chhetri is taking India's name forward in the football world
 america footbaal gyaarah khilaadiyon kii do tiimon ke bich khelaa jane vaala ek lokapriy khel he jisamen har team kaa uddeshy he kii vah gend ko duusari team ke "and zone" main pahunchaakar ank batore
 The team that has possession of the ball tries to extend it to the opponent's endzone by running with the ball or throwing the ball among their teammates
 agar us team kaa koi khilaadi gend pakade hue gol kii lakeer ko paar karke virdohi oundzon main pahunch jaataa he, yaa oundzon ke andar khadaa hua apane saathi dwaara phenki gai gend ko safaltaapurvak pakad letaa he yaa phir maidan se gol kii lakeer ke peeche bane do khambon ke bich se gend ko laat markar pahunchaa detaa he to uski team ko ank milte hai
 The job of the opposing team is to somehow catch the ball by hitting, dropping, or catching the ball thrown in the middle, or to prevent the enemy team from moving towards their team's endzone
 america footbaal adhiktar sanyukt rajya america or canada main kheli jaati he
 The name of the institute that governs its sport at a commercial level is the "national Football League", which is called the short form NFL
 america main is khel ke do mukhya rup hai, college footbaal or vyavsaayik footbaal, jinke niyam ek-dusre se thode alag hai
 Football is also played in the higher classes of schools and the rules are also slightly different
 khel kaa maidan 100 gaz lambaa or 53
3 gaz chaudaa hota he
 There is a round streak on both sides of the length of the field, ahead of which there are ten zones of ten Gaz, i
e
 the total length of the field is 120 Gaz
 maidan main har paanch gaz ke faasale par ek yardline naam kii lakeer hoti he
 At the end of every endzone there are two pillars at a height of 10 feet from the ground, which are called "goalposts"
 kisi bhi samay har team maidan main apane 11 khilaadi rakh sakati he, lekin tiimon ko adhikaar hota he ki khel main kisi bhi antaraal ke samay apana ek yaa sabhi khilaadi badal de
 Therefore, football is a specialist sportsman
 kisi bhi team main vastav main bahut se khilaadi hote hai, jinhen teen prakaaron main baanta jaataa he: akramak khilaadi, rakshak khilaadi or vishesh khilaadi 
 Some players are kept in teams only because if a player with their own skills gets hurt, they can be put in their place
 zyaadaatar muqaabalon main kisi bhi team ke kai khilaadiyon ko maidan main utarane kaa mauqaa hi nahin miltaa
 The team that has possession of the ball is called "aggressive" and the one who does not have it is called the "defender"
 akramak team ke sabase mahatvapurn khilaadi ko quarterbaque kehete hai
 When the attacker and the defenders begin to fight, it is their job to quickly review the field and decide which player in the offensive team is in the best position to move the ball towards the guard team's endzone
 phir quarterbaque use gend fank detaa he, yaa khud hi bhagkar gend aage badhaane kii koshish karata he
 The entire time of the game is one hour, which is divided into four 15 minute squares
 duusari chauthai ke baad ek 12 minute kaa viraam hota he
 The ball stops several times while playing and then the playing clock is also stopped
 is se 15 minute kii chauthai vastav main 45 minute se bhi adhik le sakati he or puraa ek ghante kaa khel vastav main teen ghante se bhi zyaada chal saktaa he
 Broadcasters show commercials at these intervals when the game airs on television
 muqaabale kii shuruyaat main sikaa uchhaala jaataa he or ek team ko aakraamak team ghoshit kar ke unhen gend de di jaati he
 Now, on a 50 ghz streak, both teams stand face-to-face to face each other
 aakraamak team kaa quarterbaque apni team ke peeche khadaa hota he
 The atmosphere is such that two groups are getting ready for war
 khel shuru hota he jab gend aakraamak quarterbaque ke haathon main pahunchati he
 Immediately, the players of the defending team reach him and are stubbornly trying to demolish him
 kuch aakraamak khilaadi unase bhidakar unhen rokane kii koshish karte hai, jabaki baaqi akramak khilaadi virdohi ke kshetra main daakhil hokar apane aap ko gend aage badhaane ke liye acchhee sthiti main daalane kii koshish karte hai
 The quarterback has a few moments in which to decide: which partner to throw the ball or to find a way to run away
 kuch hi kshanon main uski raksha karne vaale ginati ke akramak khilaadiyon ko unase jujhane vaale rakshak khilaadi patakekar yaa dhakelkar quarterbaque tak pahunch jate hai
 If the ball is in the hands of the quarterback and is nabbed, it is called a "sac" and is considered very embarrassing for any quarterback
 adhik baar sac hone kaa matlab he kii quarterbaque jhadpon ke bich soch nahin paaya: vah kamazor he or aakraamakon kaa netritv karne ke qaabil nahin he
 Regardless of whether the quarterback throws the ball to someone, he himself grows it, usually the defenders take the offensive player with the ball at a short distance and the ball stops
 is sthiti ko down kehete hai
 The aggressors' job is to raise the ball at least 10 yards in 4 downs
 agar ve aisa nahin kar pate to rakshakon ko gend par qabza de diya jaataa he or rakshak ab aakraamak banate hai or aakraamak rakshak
 The possession of the ball also changes if the ball is missed by an offensive hand and a keeper catches the moving ball or the quarterback throws the ball to another offensive player and a keeper comes in the middle
 fambal yaa interspshan kii sthiti main jis rakshak ne gend pakad liya he vah virdohi ke oundzon kii taraf foran bhaagna shuru kar saktaa he or tab tak bhaag saktaa he jab tak use giraakar daboch na liye jaae, maidan se baahar na dhakel diya jaae, yaa vah oundzon main pahunchakar apane team ke liye ank hi na bana le
 When the ball stops, it is carefully measured at which gazza it is in the 100 Gaz field
 aglaa khel maidan ke bich main usee gaz par shuru kiya jaataa he
 This place is called the "streak of confrontation"
 jaisaa kii kaha gaya he, aakraamak team kaa yahi maqasad he ki chaar yaa us se kam dounon main gend 10 gaz aage bade
 Suppose they put the ball forward 10 yards in two downs
 to kaha jaataa he ki ve phir se pehle down par hai or unhen ab is nai scrimmege lakeer se phir se chaar dounon main gend ko 10 gaz badhanaa he
 This cycle continues until the offensive defenders reach the endzone or accidentally give the opponent possession of the ball
 qabza badalane par jo khel main rukaav hota he, usamen khilaadi bhi badal die jate hai
 Many aggressive players are adept at running and catching a thrown ball and often have light bodies
 bahut se rakshak bhimkaay hote hai or agar ve daboch len yaa patake den to zyaadaatar aakraamak-vishesh khilaadiyon ke liye uthaanaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 a good aggressor is one who knows how to catch the ball thrown by the quarterback without making a mistake, and who can dodge the runaway defenders and extend the ball far into enemy territory
 kuch aakraamakon kaa kaam hota he ki ve rakshakon se bhiden taaki anya aakraamak gend aage le ja saken
 Their name itself is "offensive Tackle"

 This war took place in 1274 BC and this is the first war in history which has written evidence as well as mention of strategy in war

 pracheen misr main kai varshen tak videshi hiksos logon ne raaj kiya par dhire dhire misr ke mul raajaaon kii shakti badi or unhone hyxos ke raaj ko hataa diya or samrajyavad kii niti apanaakar apane padausi rajyon ko jeetna shuru kar diya
 The kings of the 18th dynasty of Egypt first adopted this policy and first created the empire of Egypt, the king of the 18th dynasty Thutmose III became quite famous because of his Digvijay
 par baad main 18 wein vansh ke raja akhenaten ke kaal main misr samrajya dagamagane laga or usne apane kai praant kho die, akhenaten ne pracheen misr ke paaramparik dharm ko tyaag kar aten naam ke ishwar kii puja karne laga or ise rashtriya dharm ghoshit kar diya tha jis kaaran misr main araajaktaa fail gai thi
 After Akhenaten, his son Tutankhamun and his successors tried hard to recover the lost glory of Egypt, but they failed
 horemheb jo 18 wein vansh kaa aakhri raja tha uski koi santan nahin thi isiilie usne apane amaatya rameces pratham ko apana uttaradhikari banaaya or rameces pratham ne 19 wein vansh kii niv rakhi
 Ramesses i and his son Seti i also followed the policy of imperialism like the 18th dynasty and tried to bring the lost glory of Egypt
 karnak mandir ke lekhon ke anusaar seti pratham ne kannan or syria par vijay pai thi
 The same Hittite empire, extending from Iraq to Turks in the north of Egypt, was also expanding the empire
 syria tab 18 wein vansh ke adheen tha par wo hittite samrajya ke adheen chalaa gaya tha
 The Rameses attacked Kadesh, a city of Syria, to win the lost province of the Egyptian Empire
 rameces ke pita seti pratham ne apane kaal main kadesh par vijay pai thi, par seti pratham ke shashan kaal ke antim samay main kadesh dubaara hittite samrajya ke adheen ho gaya
 This was also the reason for the war
 rameces ne apane shashan kaal ke 5wein varsh main dakshin se kadeshpar hamalaa kiya
 At the same time, the Hittite king Muwatalli, together with his neighboring kingdom, formed a union against the Egyptian army
 muvatalli ne apni sena kadesh main jamaa kar lee or apane guptchar rameces ke paas bheje, un guptcharon ne rameces ko jhooth kaha kii ve kadeshse dur he
 In 1274 BCE, Ramesses with his army was larger than his capital p Ramesses towards Kadesh, his army was divided into four columns named Amun, Ra, Seth and Pitah, another small group named Narin which is not mentioned much
 misr vaasiyon ke alaava rameces kii sena main kaanan, syria, nubia aadi deshon ke log bhi the
 Ramesses built many chariots, so much that historians can only guess
 muvatalli kii sena ke bare main rameces likhvata he ki muvatalli apane 19 padosi rajyon kii sena bulawaai thi rameces ke viruddh
 Ramesses writes in his article that he was in a large, Ramesses amun troop on Kadesh with his army
 vah sabase pehle kadesh kii pahadiyon par pahocha, phir orontes nadi paar kar vah kadesh nagar pahocha
 Amun troop was behind Ramesses, Ra troop was in a nearby town, Patah troop was in a south town and Sethu troop was on the road
 jab rameces kadesh se 11 kilometre dur tha tab use kuch banjaare mili jo asal main muvatalli ke guptchar the, unhone rameces ko jhooth bataaya kii muvatalli firo se dar gaya he or hathi sena yahan aane se dar rahi he, hathi sena aleppo kii bhoomi main he jo yahan se 200 kilometre dur he
 But later when those Banjars were beaten, they confessed the truth and told that Muwatalli's army was nearby
 puri hathi sena ne ek saath misr kii sena par hamalaa bol diya
 The Ramesses had divided their forces into pieces and they were far from each other, the Hatti army first attacked the Ra's troops and almost destroyed it, the remaining warriors somehow reached the Amun troop
 rameces ne pitaah or set tukdi ko sandesh bheja par tab tak hathi sena amun tukdi tak pahoch chuki thi
 Hatti Ratho broke the security wall of the Amun troop and started killing them
 rameces apane lekh main likhvata he ki use hathi sena ne gher liya tha, uske paas koi angrakshak yaa koi yoddha na tha
 Then the Ramesses took the front and killed many of the Cesanics, then the remaining warriors of Amun and Ra's troops came to save their king
 hathi sena ke kai yoddha misr ke shiviron ko lutane ke liye chale gaye, or jo bache the unase rameces or bache hue misr ke yoddha lard rahe the
 With the help of a chariot and a bow, the Egyptian soldier greatly defeated the Hassan
 rameces ko acha avasar mila or usne bephikr hathi sena par hamalaa kar diya jo lutpaat kar rahi thi, rameces ne hathi sainik ko orontes nadi ke paar khaded diya
 Even after the Hatti army was repulsed, Muvattalli again sent a large army, in that army there were many chariots, foot soldiers who were inside the city wall
 hathi sena dubaara misr ke shivi tak pahochi par achaanak se naarin tukdi ne hamalaa bol diya, hathi sena chakit ho gai thi
 By then the Ramesses had gathered their entire army and attacked the Hatti army
 ab hathi sena ghir chuki thi or lagbhag tabah ho chuki thi, bache hue hathi sainik kadesh tak kisi tarah pahoch gaye
 The next day the war started again, Ramesses writes that Muvattalli had called him for a ceasefire treaty, but there is no mention of it in the Hittite article
 misr sainik kadesh kii deevaaron ko giraane main naakaam rahe or muvatalli bhi misr sainiko ko khadedane main naakaam rahaa jabaki lag rahaa tha kii jeet uske paksh main he
 Both sides suffered a lot and eventually the war ended without any result

 For this service, he received the status of Companion of the Order of Indian Empire
 inhone san 1887 se da deccan agriculchrists relif act ke antargat vishesh nyaayadhish ke padbhaar ko bhi sambhala
 Ranade was from a staunch Chitpavan Brahmin family

 After the death of his first wife, his reformers wanted him to marry a widow and save her
 parantu, unhone apane parivaar kaa maan rakhte hue, ek balika, ramabai ranade se vivaah kiya, jise baad main unhone shikshit bhi kiya
 After his death, his wife undertook his educational and social reforms
 unke koi santan nahin thi
 ---> apane mitron doytmaram pandurang, bal mangesh vaagle evam vaaman abaaji modak ke sang, ranade ne prarthana-samaaj kii sthapana kii, jo ki brahmo samaaj se prerit ek hinduvadi andolan tha
 It was based on the principles of published theism, which was based on the ancient Vedas
 prarthana samaaj maharashtra main keshav chandra sen ne armbh kiya tha, jo ek drudh brahmasamaji the
 It was originally committed to bring religious reforms in Maharashtra
 ranade saamaajik sammelan andolan ke bhi sansthaapak the, jise unhone mrityu paryant samarthan diya, jiske dwaara unhone samaaj sudhaar, jaise bal vivaah, vidhwaa mundan, vivaah ke aadambaron par baari aarthik vyay, sagarpar yatra par jaateey pratibandh ityadi kaa virodh kiya
 He laid full emphasis on widow remarriage and female education
 ranade ne pune saarvajanik sabha kii sthapana kii or baad main bhartiya rashtriya congress ke sansthaapakon main se ek bane
 He was always shown as a former opponent of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and a trusted advisor to Gopal Krishna Gokhale

 In a letter to Henri Fossett, Florence Nightengale wrote: 1943 main, babasaheb bhimrao ambedkar ne, ranade kii prashansa kii, evam unhen gandhi or jinah ke virdohi kaa darja diya
 Ranade has written many articles and books on social, religious, economic and political subjects
 in rachanaaon ko anek sheershakon se sankalit kiya gaya he
 His articles titled "ranade's Economical Writing" have been edited by Vipin Chandra which was published by Gyan Books Private Limited based in New Delhi
 yah siddh karne ke liye ki unke vichaar shastron ke purnat: anuroop the, unhone vidvattapurna granth likhe, jaise 'vidhwaaon ke punarvivaah ke samarthan main veda' or 'bal vivaah ke viruddh shastron kaa mat
 ' ranade 19veen sadi ke bhartiya sudhaarwadi the
 He was opposed to revivalism
 punarutthanavaad kii simaaon ko rekhaankit karte hue unhone apane ek lekh main likhaa tha ki- There is nothing exuberant and extravagant in Ranade
 He refused to reap cheap notoriety by playing the part of an extremist
 He refused to mislead people by playing upon and exploiting the patriotic sentiments of the people
 He refused to be a party to methods which are crude, which have volume but no effect, and which are neither fool-proof nor knave-proof, and which break the back even of the most earnest and sincere servants of the country and disable them from further effort
 In short, Ranade was like the wise captain who knows that his duty is not to play with his ship clever and masterful tricks, just for effect and show in the midst of the ocean, but to take it safely to its appointed port
 In short, Ranade was not a forged bank note and in worshipping him we have no feeling of kneeling before anything that is false

 anuvanshiki or rog main bahudhaa koi na koi sambandh rahata he
 Many diseases are caused by contaminated environment and conditions, but there are many diseases due to which there is a defect due to birth from parents
 e rog anuvanshik rog kehalaate hai
 There are some diseases that arise as a result of both genetics and environmental influences
 jeevon main nar ke shukranu tathaa stri kii andkoshika ke sanyog se santan kii utpatti hoti he
 Both the sperm and scrotum contain nucleus
 in cendrakasutron main sthit jin ke swabhavanusaar santan ke maansik tathaa shaareerik gun or dosha nishchit hote hai
 Because of one or a few genes being defective, only those defects occur in the child
 kuch dosha main se koi rog utpann nahin hota, keval santan kaa shaareerik sanghathan aisa hota he ki usamen vishesh prakaar ke rog sheeghra utpann hote hai
 Therefore, to know for sure whether the cause of the disease is heredity or adverse environment is not always feasible
 anuvanshik rogon kii sahi gananaa main anya kathinaaiyaan bhi hai
 For example; Many congenital diseases appear only when they are old
 duusari ore, kuch anuvanshik doshayukt bachche janm lete hi mar jate hai
 The disease is manifested in each generation due to their effect on the presence of antitussive pathogenic genes, but diseases caused by the degraded gene occur spontaneously in any offspring of the offspring, as evident by Mendel's hereditary rules
 kuch rog ladakiyon se kahin adhik sankhya main ladakon main paae jate hai
 Many examples of genetic diseases can be given
 inamen se kuch nimnlikhit hai : Cataract, hyperpigmentation, glaucoma, long-sightedness, etc
, occur due to defect of anticonvulsant gene
 tirohit jin ke kaaran vivarnataa, astigmatism, keratoconus, ityadi rog utpann hote hai
 Sexually transmitted genital diseases, which are more prevalent in men, are diseases like blindness, night blindness, night blindness etc
 inamen ek sau se adhik anuvanshik rogon kii gananaa kii gai he
 Among these are psoriasis, ichthiasis, keratosis, etc
 adhikangulata, yuktangulata, kai prakaar kabonapan, asthiyon kaa uchit reeti se na viksit hona, janm se hi nitambasthi kaa ukhda rahanaa ityadi Haemophilia, special types of anemia etc
 madhumeh, gathiya, chehre kaa vikrut tathaa bhayaavah ho janaa ityadi
 Heredity, epilepsy, hypnosis may also be the cause of heredity
 vividh rog, jaise bahraapan, goongaapan, kataa hont, videern taalu aadi bhi anuvanshikta se prabhavit hote hai

 Several arrangements have been devised to classify asteroids into categories based on alphabet, albido, etc
 but two of them are more prevalent
 yah san 1984 main david tholen naamak khagolashastri dwaara prastavit kii gai thi
 Its categories were defined on the basis of a study done on 978 asteroids in 1980 under the 'octagonal Asteroid Survey'
 is vyavastha main 14 shreniyan hai
 Most of the asteroids fall into only 3 of these categories, and the remaining 11 have fewer asteroids
 teen mukhya shreniyan is prakaar hai: Other categories are as follows: is shrenee vyavastha main agar kisi kshudragrah main ek se adhik shrenee ke gun hon to use kabhi-kabhi CG jaisi mishrit shrenee main daal diya jaataa tha
 It is a hierarchy set up in 2002
 yah 1447 kshudragrahon kaa adhyayan karne vaale 'chote mukhya-ghere kshudragrahon ke varnakrami surveykshan' par aadhaarit he
 Although the spectrum was more closely measured, the spectrum it measured was less than Tholen studies
 jab SMASS kii shreneeyaan nirdhaarit kii gai to jahaan tak sambhav tha puraani tholen shreneeyaan rakhane kii koshish kii gai
 The categories of SMASS are as follows: ek chikitsa nidaan ke rup main, bal yon shoshan peedophilia, ko aamtaur par vayaskon yaa bade umr ke kishoron main maansik vikaar ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he, jo gaiyr-kishor bacchon ke prati praathmik yaa vishesh yon ruchi dwaara charitaarth hota he
 In case of adolescent exploiters aged 16 or older, the child should be at least five years younger
 The word originated from the Greek: παῖς, meaning "child", "and φιλία," friendly love "or" friendship ", although in modern times its literal meaning is used by pedophiles, who symbolize their choice
 And the use of the code has been changed to sexual attraction towards children under the title "child love" or "child lover"
 rogon ke antarrashtriya vargeekaran ne peedophilia ko "vayask vyaktitv or vyavhaar ke vikaar" ke rup main paribhaashit kiya he, jisamen chote umr ke kishoron yaa bahut chote umr ke bacchon ke prati yon ruchi hoti he
 Numerous definitions of the term have been found in psychiatry, psychology, vernacular and law enforcement

 The current DSM-5 draft proposed adding hebaphilia to the diagnostic criteria and hence was renamed as pedohebophilic disorder

 aam upyog main peedophilia kaa arth he kisi bhi bachche ke prati yon ruchi yaa main kisi bhi bachche ke saath yon durvyavhaar karnaa, ise aksar "peedophilic vyavhaar" kaha jaataa he
 For example, The American Heritage Stedmans Medical Dictionary stated that, "pedophilia is an activity or fantasy of sexually abusing a child or children on behalf of adults
 " yah aam upyog anuprayog yon ruchi main bhi vistaarit hota he or choti umr ke bacchon yaa bade umr ke bacchon kaa yon shoshan kiya jaataa he
 Researchers suggest that these incorrect uses should be avoided, as people who sexually abuse children are normally afflicted with a muscular disorder, but some offenders differ from the standard diagnosis of pedophilia and clinical diagnosis
 The standard deals with children of age just before they reach adulthood

 Pedophilia was first formally recognized in the late 19th century
 1980 ke dashak ke baad se is kshetra main mahatvapurn maatra main anusandhan kiya gaya he
 Currently, the exact reasons for having pedophilia have not been established
 shodh bataate hai ki peedophilia kai alag-alag mastishk sambandhi asaamanyataon ke saath sahasambaddha ho sakate hai or aksar anya vyaktitv vikaron or manovaigyanik vikrutiyon ke saath maujuud hote hai
 a diversity of typologies has been suggested for the classification of pedophiles according to behavior and motivation in the contexts of forensic psychology and law enforcement
 is shabd kii vyutpatti unani : παιδοφιλία παῖς se hui he, jiskaa arth he baccha or φιλία kaa arth he "dostana pyaar" yaa "dosti"

 inphentophilia, yaa nepeophilia, kaa istemaal shishuon or chote bacchon ke prati yon ruchi kaa ullekh karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Pedophilia is used for sexual interest of adults with children 13 or younger
 hebephilia ko praathmik rup se 11-14 umr ke bacchon ke saath vayaskon kii yon ruchi ke liye paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 DSM IV did not list hebaphilia at diagnosis, whereas ICD-10 pedophilia included hebaphilia
 shabd peedophilia irotica ko 1886 main vineez manochikitsak richard won craft-abing dwaara unki psycopetheya sexualij kriti main gadha gaya tha
 The term appears in the section titled "violation of persons under fourteen years old", which generally focuses on the aspect of forensic psychiatry of child abuse offenders
 craft-abing aparaadhiyon ke kai prakaaron kaa varnan karti he, mul rup se unhen psycopathological or gaiyr-psycopathological main vibhajit karti he or kai spasht kaarnon kaa anumaan karti he jo ki bal shoshan kii ore agrasar ho sakati he
 kraft-ebbing mentions pedophilia erotica in a type of "psychological sexual perversion"
 unhone likhaa he ki upane karier main unhen keval chaar baar iskaa saamana karnaa padaa tha or prayek maamle kaa unhone sankshipt vivaran diya tha, jiske teen aam lakshan hai: He has cited several cases of adult women suffering from pedophilia and considered abuses by gay men with boys extremely rare
 is baat ko or spasht karne ke liye kaha ki, unhone sanket diya he ki vayask purushon ke maamalon jinamein kuch chikitsakeey yaa mastishk sambandhi vikaar hota he or bacchon ke saath durupyog karnaa peedophilia nahin hota he or unki nigaraanee main vaise purush ativyask or bachche hote hai
 He has also listed pseudopidophilia related to it, in which "individuals who lose libido through masturbation and later become attracted to children for their sexual appetites" are considered the most common symptoms
 1908 main, swiss neuranatomist or manochikitsak agste foril ne is ghatana ke bare main likhaa, jisamen "paderosisi", "bacchon ke liye yon bhukh" ke rup main prastaavit kiya
 Like kraft-ebbing's work, Fole made a distinction between accidental sexual abuse by a person with dementia and other biological brain conditions, and a sexual and sometimes special preference for children
 However, he disagreed with the idea of it being sustainable and irreversible after craft-ebbing
 is sthiti ke liye shabd "peedophilia" aam taur par sweekaarya ho gaya he or 20 veen sadi main bade paimaane par dekha gaya or stedman ke 5 wein sanskaran ke rup main lokapriy chikitsa shabdkosh main paaya gaya

 1987 main sanshodhan aar, DSM-III-, main vivaran ko mote taur par hi rakhaa gaya, lekin adhyatan or vistaarit naidanik mandandon ko pradaan kiya gaya
 Some physicians proposed a few more classes that differed somewhat from pedophilia, including "pedohebophilia", "hebephilia", and "ephebophilia"
 Other experts, such as Karen Franklin, classify hebephilia as a "pretextual" diagnosis that should not be treated as a disorder
 aisidi-10, peedophilia ko "bachche, ladke ladkiyaan yaa donon ke liye yon variyata, aamtaur par kam umr yaa ati kam umr ke bachche ke rup main ke rup main paribhaashit karata he
 "the criteria for this system are based on a person aged 16 or over if there is a persistent or dominant sexual desire for children at least five years younger than that
 
 The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder Text Revision outlines specific criteria for use in the diagnosis of this disorder
 isamen kalpanayukta, vyavhaar yaa aagrah se utpann yon vyavhaar kii upasthiti jisamen choti umr ke bachche ke saath yon gatividhi kareeb chah mahine yaa usase adhik samay ke liye or is prakaar ke ichchhaaon ke liye rogi in agrahon yaa sankat se grast hote hai
 The criteria also indicate that the patient must be 16 or older and that children he or she thinks should be at least 5 years younger than him or her, although children ages 12–13 and older adolescents
 It is advisable to separate from it
 bachche kii ling ke aadhaar par rogi ke nidaan ko or adhik nirdisht kiya gaya he, yadi aavegon yaa anachar karne ke liye simit kaary kar rahe hai or yadi"aakarshan" "vishesh" yaa "gaiyr vishesh" he to
 Numerous terms have been used to describe actual pedophilia, ranging from non-pedophilic to non-particular offenders, or an interest in pedophilic has been seen to distinguish between types of offenders according to motivation for offenders
 vishesh peedophilia ko kabhi-kabhi "vaastavik peedophilia" ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 They are attracted to children only
 kuch maamalon main ve apane umr ke logon main ruchi pradarshit karte hai or aisa tabhi hota he jab ve kisi bachche kii upasthiti kii kalpana karte hai
 a patient with non-specialized pedophilia may be referred to as a non-pedophilic offender, but the two terms are not always synonymous
 gaiyr-vishesh peedophilia ke rogi bachche or vayask donon se aakarshith hote hai or donon ke dwaara yon ichha hoti he, haalanki yon variyata ek ke bajaae duusare main zyada maujuud ho saktaa he
 Neither ICD nor DSM diagnostic criteria are required for actual sexual activity with young age youth
 kalpana kii maujuudagi yaa yon aagrah ke aadhaar par iskaa nidaan kiya ja saktaa he, yahaan tak ki kabhi aisi koi gatividhi nahin hui ho
 duusari ore, ek vyakti jo iskaa anubhav kar chukaa ho or apni kalpana yaa aagrah ko lekar kisi prakaar kaa sankat mahasoos nahin kiya ho, unka bhi nidaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Sexual urges to diagnose it are not limited to sex, and sometimes masturbation can be seen by obscene exposure, vorealistic or frateristic, or child prognosis

 Similarly, when the patient is an older adolescent, the age difference is more difficult to specify and instead requires consideration of the situation

 The World Health Organization allows its patients to seek treatment to change their sexual orientation
 DSM IV maapdand kii adhik samaveshi ke saath-saath kam samaveshi hone ke liye aalochana kii gai he
 Although most researchers distinguish child libido from a patient of pedophilia, Studer and Alvin argue that DSM criteria are more inclusive because all acts of child abuse justify the diagnosis
 ek bal utpeedak e maapdandon ko santusht karata he kyonki chote umr ke bacchon ke saath yon gatividhi ke saath vyavhaar shaamil hota he or maapdand bi kyonki vyakti un agrahon par krity karata he
 Furthermore, they argue that it is less inclusive in the case of individuals who do not act on it and are not disturbed by it
 Later points were made by several other researchers who stated that it is a so-called "satiated pedophile" - a person who imagines engaging in sexual activity with a child and masturbating, but never with a child Not having sexual intercourse and after which the patient does not feel distressed - does not meet the DSM-IV-TR criteria for pedophilia, because this person meets criteria b Security does not

 The current proposal for DSM v will also resolve the current overlap between pedophilia and hebeapilia by combining both diagnoses into a single newly diagnosed pedohebophilic disorder
 This new diagnosis would be equivalent to the ICD-10 definition of pedophilia that already contains early pubescents
 tathaapi, o'donohue ek alag disha main is mudde ko le liya he, jo ki naidanik maandand akele bacchon ke liye aakarshan karne ke liye saral ho saktaa he uske bajaay suzav detaa he yadi aatm report, prayogshaala nishkarshon, yaa pichley vyavhaar se pataa lagaaya jaae

 "similarly, in 1997, Howard E
 Barbary and Michael C
 Seto disagreed with the American Psychiatric Association's approach and recommended the use of classification as the only criterion for simplifying pedophilia diagnosis

 Pedophilia can be described as a disorder of sexual preference, a phenomenon similar to homosexual or heterosexual orientation, because its emergence develops before or during younger ages and because it stabilizes over time
 haalanki in tippaniyon main maansik vikaar ke ek samooh se peedophilia ko shaamil nahin kiya jaataa he kyonki peedophilic kriya nuksaan pahunchaati he kabhi-kabhi peedophyle maansit swasthya peshwaron ko unke aavegon se kaary karne se madad karti he

 Many researchers have reported correlations between pedophilia and this type of psychological characteristics, such as low self-esteem and poor social skills
 Cohen et al
, Studying child sexual abuse, stated that victims of pedophilia impair interpersonal function and impair passive-aggression as well as self-concept
 disinehibitary lakshan ke bare main peedophyle vikrut sosiopathi or sangyanatmak pravriti kaa pradarshan karte hai
 According to the authors, the symptoms of pedophiles help support the pathological personality hypothesis in which such distortion is related to further motivation for pedophilic behavior

 a review of the study of child sex offenders, a qualitative research study published between 1982 and 2001, concluded that pedophiles use cognitive distortion to satisfy their individual needs and justify mistreatment by excuses, love and reciprocity Redefine their actions and exploit the innate ability in all adult-child relationships
 anya sangyanatmak vikrutiyon main "kaamuktha ke rup main bal shoshan", "yon kriya main aniyantran" or "yon paatrata-purvaagrah" shaamil hai
 a review of the literature concluded that research on personality is co-related and that psychopathology in pedophiles is rarely correct as a rule, leading to confusion between pedophiles and child sexual abuse perpetrators, as well as difficult to obtain pedophile representations and community sampling is

 The term pedophile is commonly used to describe all child sexual abuse offenders, including those that are not standardized as diagnostic diagnostics, as the most distinct distinction between child abuse and pedophilia
 Is seen as problematic
