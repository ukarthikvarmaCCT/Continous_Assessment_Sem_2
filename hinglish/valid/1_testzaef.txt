 ekamusth bhugtan policy ek sanvidatmak jivan beemaa he jo is prakaar banaaya gaya he ki ek nishchit samay avadhi ke baad yaa samaypurv mrityu ho jane par, graahak ko ekamusth raashi kaa bhugtan kar diya jaye
 adarshatah yah samyavadhi das, pandrah yaa kuch nishchit aayu seemaa ke liye 20 varsh tak hoti he
 There are some policies that pay off even in the event of fatal illnesses
 yah sabhi policy saamanyatya paaramparik rup se laabh yukt yaa unit-linkd hoti hai
 The lump sum amount can also be received quickly, in such a case, the policyholder gets the surrender value which is determined by the insurance company on the basis of how long the policy has been in operation and the total amount to be paid so far
 Already happened
 iske antargat graahak ko ek nishchit raashi ke bhugtan kaa vaada kiya jaataa he jise bimaakrit raashi kehete hai or ise nivesh pradarshan ke aadhaar par samayik laabhon ke sangyojan dwaara badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 At the end of the fixed term regular benefits are guaranteed and at the end another non-guaranteed benefit can be given which is known as terminal bonus
 vipareet nivesh paristhitiyon main nakdikaran mulya yaa sarender mulya ko ek 'bazaar mulya hraas ' yaa emviar ke pariman ke baraabar ghataya ja saktaa he 
 aise kisi upaay kaa prayog un niveshkon kii raksha karne ke liye kiya jaataa he jo fund main bane rahanaa chaahate hai banisbat unke jo stock bazaar ke neeche jane kii dasha main thode se munaafe ke saath apane paise nikaal lenaa chaahate hai or aisa karte samay ve jokhim se milane vaali suraksha ko bhi dhyaan main nahin rakhte
 yadi ek emvie ke kaaran samyavadhi samaapt hone se purv hi bhugtan karnaa padataa he to us bhugtan main tatkaaleen kosh prabandhak dwaara apanaayi gayi nitiyon ke aadhaar katautee kii jaati he
 The lump sum payment policy has been criticized in the past for offering low level surrender and low level concession while a customer is unable to pay
 yah policy girvee vastu ke badale main rin dene vaali un pranali ke vipareet thi jo aisi paristhitiyon main kuch had tak riyaayat de detii hai, atah atirek aadi ke parinamswaroop, jivan beemaa companiyaan praayah dhyanpurvak premium nahin die jane par yojanagat 'bhugtan' kaa tarika apanaati hai
 Unit-linked lump sum payments are investments where premiums are invested in units of integrated insurance funds
 jivan beemaa kii laagat kii purti ke liye ikaiyon ko bhunaa liya jaataa he
 Policyholders can often choose which fund their premium is being invested in and in what proportion
 ikai mulya niyamit rup se prakashit kiye jate hai or policy ko bhunaane par praapt hone vaali keemat ikaiyon ke vartmaan mulya ke baraabar hoti he
 This is its simplest definition
 purna ekamusth bhugtan laabh sahit ekamusth bhugtan kii shrenee main aata he, jahaan mul bimaakrit raashi policy ke prarambh hone par milane vaale deth benefit ke baraabar hoti he or vruddhi hone kii avasthaa main antat milane vaala bhugtan bimaakrit raashi se kahin adhik hota he
 a low-cost lump sum payment is a combination of the following components: a lump sum payment where the projected future growth rate reaches a set amount and a decreasing life insurance component to ensure that the stipulated death occurs
 The amount will be paid as the minimum amount
 kam laagat vaale ekamusth bhugtan kaa mukhya uddeshy yah rahaa he ki ekamusth rin bhugtan main byaaj kaa bhugtan kiya jaye, keval policy kii samyavadhi ke samaapt hone par yaa isse purv hi policydharak kii mrityu ho jane kii avasthaa main hi aavashyak premium ke saath kiya gaya purna ekamusth bhugtan isse adhik hoga
 The lump sum payment policy or the lump sum payment policy taken from the other, is a lump sum payment with traditional benefits that have been sold to a new owner within the time period
 tieepi market kharidaaron ko prerit karte hai ki ve beemaa kampani dwaara prastaavit mulya se adhik sarender mulya par avaanchit ekamusth bhugtan policy khariden
 niveshak sarender mulya se adhik mulya denge kyonki policy ko samay se purv samaapt kar lene ke sthaan par use jari rakhane par uski keemat main vruddhi hoti he
 When a policy is sold, all of its profit rights are transferred to its new owner
 bhavishya main kiye jane vaale premium ke bhugtan ke liye policy kaa nayaa swami jimmedaari letaa he or policy kii samyavadhi samaapt ho jane par yaa policydharak kii mrityu ho jane par paripakvata mulya praapt karata he
 Policyholders who sell their policy do not get any benefit of life insurance after selling the policy and after this they should consider whether they want to get any alternative insurance
 tieepi bazaar vishesh rup se paaramparik laabh yukt policy se sambandhit kaary karte hai
 The simplest way to decide whether a lump sum payment policy falls into this category is to see whether your policy documents refer to units as unified benefits or unit-linked policies when referring to units, If the profit is in sterling, there is no mention of the units and then it is probably a policy with traditional benefits
 anya prakaar kii policy - "unit-linkd" or "laabh ke saath ekikrut" policy main ek pradarshan ghatak hota he jo pratyaksh rup se bazaar kii vartmaan nivesh paristhitiyon par nirbhar karata he
 Their commercial use is not possible because the guarantee given on this policy is very less and there is no difference between its market value and the surrender value
 sanshodhit ekamusth bhugtan kaa srijan technical karections act of 1988 main ekal premium life kaa prayog kar aashray ke rup main kiye jane kii pratikriya ke falswaroop hua tha
 These contracts are lower than the 7 tier annual premium and are subject to more stringent tax rules
 These ira-like items are also subject to the annuity rules
 If a life insurance policy is changed and then becomes suitable for the 7-payment rule, it can be redefined as an amended lump sum payment

 These pats are used to keep a plate of guests' food or ceremonial items, to place the bride and groom in marriage, etc
 lakdi ke saadhaaran paaton kii apeksha chaandi ke kalatmak pate ucch str, pratishtha evam sammaan ke dyotak hote hai
 Vishal patte located in the mohallas are of three types: First: The palates built and established in the past by the benevolent persons of the King of Bikaner, who have been a symbol of their political and administrative dominance, social prestige, economic prosperity and cultural contributions
 doosraa: katipay jatiyon dwaara sthapit pate, jo jati vishesh kii ucch sthiti ko ingit karne ke saath-saath antarjaateey sambandhon, jaateey sadasyon ke antarsambandhon, saarvajanik kriyakalapon, athwa gatividhiyaan, daan-punya kii kriyaaon aadi ke kendra rahe hai

 Prakotayukta is part of the Pata culture in the city of Bikaner
 saamaanya jan dwaara is shahar ke jivan ko pata samskruti kaha jaataa he
 Before explaining the Pata culture and the cultural context of the Pats, the meaning of culture and the structure of culture has to be discussed
 pata aitihaasik evam paramparawaadi shahar bikaner kii moulik visheshta he jise drishy rup main parkotayukta shahar main jaateey aadhaar par based vibhinn chaukon, guwadon, mohallon main saarvajanik rup se dekha ja saktaa he
 In general, Pata is a meeting or chaupal made of wood or iron, on which the residents of Mohalla sit and share their happiness and sorrow
 lekin saamaajik evam saskruthik drushti se pata parkotayukta shahar kii niamak ikai he, jis par anek paramparaayen evam reeti-rivaaj sampann hote hai
 Hence the meaning of pats can be explained in two meanings
 pata sanskrit bhashaa ke shabd sanskrit: paat se bana he jiskaa arth do kinaaron ke bich kii duuri arthath nadiyon ke do taton ke bich main jo duriyaan hoti he vah paat kehalaati he
 In the same way, the unit that determines the extent of social intercourse between two persons or two castes is called Pata, ie the place where the distance between normal and specific persons or between upper and lower castes is called Pata
 jo prarambh main vaicharik tha, kaalaantar main sthanik ho gaya or bhautik pratimaan ke rup main ubhar kar saamne aayaa
 But currently this meaning is becoming weaker
 pata samskruti kaa ek bhaag he lekin parkotayukta shahar main yah apane-aap main samskruti he
 In simple parlance the culture of this city is called Pata culture
 vastav main pata bhautik drishyman vastu he jo saarvajanik rup se uplabdh he tathaa mook darshak ke rup main gatiheen magar chetan he
 But the Pats have a cultural area
 inase sambandhit anek pratimaan he
 It is a complex of many cultural elements
 is par janm se lekar mrityuparyant tak ke sanskaar sampann hote hai
 The presence of pats is necessary in religious and social festivals
 pata purvajon kii karmasthali he
 That is why the 80-year-old woman in this percolated city must wear a veil while going ahead
 jabaki paaton par unki santaan ke baraabar ke vyakti baithe hote hai
 When the woman was asked why did you wear the veil? All the people sitting on the pats are like your children, so the reply of that woman was that Pata is the place of identification and sitting of our grandfather-in-law and father-in-law
 unki aatma to paaton par hi rahati hai kyonki unhone puraa jivan inhen paaton par bitaayaa he
 From this point of view, in the anthropological sense, Pata is a "totem", which is a sacred object as well as acts of social control
 parampara amoort evam alikhit hoti he
 Over time, written literature is based on evidence
 atah parampara to shaashvat he, jo swatah viksit hoti hai or dhire-dhire saamaajik viraasat va saamaajik pratimaan ban jaati he
 It is a difficult task to trace the origin of the tradition of Pata and Pata
 500 varshon ke parkotayukta shahar bikaner ke itihaas main paaton kii utpatti ke bare main aitihaasik pramaan khojane ke dor kuch aitihaasik pramaan mili jinke aadhaar par paaton kii utpatti ke bare main nimna nishkarsh nikaale ja sakate hai- 1
 Poet Shri Udaychand Khattargachh Mathen's work titled "bikaner Ghazal" 1709 contains reference to the chowk in the city and market description poetry, which states that - arthath bazaar ke bichombich chowk lage hue hai jin par seth-sahukaar aakar baithte hai or vyapaar, parivaar tathaa puure sansar kii baaten karte hai
 Similarly, Goda chowki is also mentioned in this composition
 goda vaastushastri tha jisane bhandasar jain mandir kaa nirmaan kiya or usee kii yaad main parkotayukta shahar ke rangdi chowk main pathar kii sundar chaowkee banaai gai he
 This garrison was famous at that time for its beautiful carvings
 yah chaowkee pate ke aakaar kii bani hui thi, shodhvetta krishnakumar sharma ke anusaar isi chaowkee par pagaudi style main saat pate rakhe jate the
 The famous Bhandasar Jain temple is built in the Pagodi style itself
 kud logon kaa kahana he mandir kaa nirmaan paaton kii is style ko dekhne ke baad kiya gaya to anya logon kaa mat he ki vaastukar goda kii yaad main yah pagauda style ke paaton kii parampara prarambh kii gai
 For the last 10 years, the Pagoda style tradition of placing seven seats on one floor has ended

 It is mentioned in the book of Harsudas Mohta

 Diwan Bakhtawar Singh later replaced his brother Gajsinghji as the ruler of Bikaner after the death of a childless ruler, replacing Amarsingh
 in aitihaasik pramaanon ke aadhaar par bikaner shahar main 1708 se paaton kii parampara chalati aa rahi he lekin lok-manyataon ke aadhaar par raav bika ke samay se hi paaton kii parampara chalati aa rahi he kyonki shaasha swayan paaton par baithkar hi shashan chalaate the
 Throning in the local language is called "sitting"
 sthaneey logon kaa kahana he ki prarambh main pate saradaaron ke deron main lagate the
 When Rao Bika asked his father Rao Jodha for the royal symbol, he promised to give it after his death
 jab unki mrityu ho gai tab unhone apane sautele bhai raav sujaji se ye chihn maange to unhone dene se manaa kar diya
 Rao Bika then attacked Jodhpur and was forced to give the royal symbol to the King of Jodhpur
 yah raav bika kii pratham raajnneetik jeet thi
 These emblems include Chhatra, Chavar, Shield, Talwar, Katar, eighteen bhauji idol of Goddess Naganechiji, Takht, Karand, Bhawardhol, Barisal Nagada, Dalsigar Ghoda and Bhojai
 jinamein takht rajdurbar kaa pavitra singhaasana he
 Its shape is similar to that of Pate
 jab raav bika is takht par baithe tab unhone apane saradaaron se kaha tha ki ’’ham baithe apane darbar paat, tum sab baitho apane dere paat‘‘ arthath aaj se ham darbar main singhaasana par baith gayi hai or tum sab bhi apane dere main singhaasana par baitho
 From the same day, the roof started appearing in front of the camp
 iske alaava jaateey panchayaton kii bahiyon main bhi paaton kii sthapana kaa ullekh miltaa he
 For example, in the book of Surdasani Panchayat, the construction of pats is mentioned in 1809
 lakhotiyon ke chowk main lakhotiyon kii panchayat bahi main bhi panchayat kaa pata bhi 18veen shatabdi main maujuud tha
 Thus the tradition of Pats has been going on in the folk life since 18th century in the city of Bikaner
 jabaki lok-manyataon ke aadhaar par yah 500 varshon se bikaner main raav bika ke samay se prachlit he
 Initially, stone posts were installed in each neighborhood instead of wooden pallets

 parkotayukta shahar ke surveykshan va nirikshan ke dauraan praapt tathyon ke aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki pata ek jatil saanskrithik skool he, jiske anek swaroop, prakaarya evam aayam hai
 The utility of the Pats is a paradigm in the life of the city of Bikaner
 jise nimnlikhit tathyagat vivaran ke aadhaar par spasht kiya ja rahaa he - The city of Bikaner, which the locals call Dharmanagar, was also called Chota Kashi before Independence, because there are some religious events such as yagnas, rituals, narrations and recitals
 yahan jitne bhi dharmik karmkand yojit kiye jate hai unki khaas pahchaan paaton kii dharmik manyata evam unka upyog he
 Pats are used everywhere in life

 Fuel tax can work as an incentive for more efficient production, so for lower pollution, car design and development of alternative fuels
 High fuel tax encourages buyers to make lighter, smaller and more fuel efficient cars, Or do not run a car at all
 Generally, today's automobile can be rebuilt 75 percent and using recycled steel we can use the car to reduce energy use and pollution
 In the United States, Congress made Faderahalli mandatory fuel efficiency, which was regularly debated, although passenger car standards could not be improved more than what the standard was made in 1985
 Light truck standards have also changed very quickly and were reported in 2007
 Alternative fuel vehicles are another option that is less polluting than conventional petroleum-driven vehicles

 data mining data se pattern nikaalane kii prakriya he
 As more data is being collected, with the amount of data doubling every three years, data mining is becoming an increasingly important tool for converting these data into information
 saamaanya rup se ise vistrut vyavhaaron kii ruparekha banane main prayog kiya jaataa he, jaise vipanan, nigaraanee, dhokhadhadi pahchaan or vaigyanik khoj
 While data mining can be used to uncover patterns in data samples, it is also important to know that using non-representative samples of data can produce results that are not suggestive of the domain
 isi tarah, data mining un pattern kaa pataa nahin lagayegaa jo domen main maujuud ho sakate hai, agar ve pattern us namoonay main maujuud nahin hai jisaki "mining" ho rahi he
 There is a trend among insufficiently knowledgeable "consumers" of results who see the "magical potential" for "data mining" and take this technology as a clear-cut medium similar to a crystal ball
 kisi bhi anya upkaran kii tarah, yah uchit kachi saamagree ke sahyojan main hi kaary karata he: is maamle main suchak or pratinidhi data jise upyogkarta dwaara pehle jamaa karnaa hoga
 iske alaava, data ke ek vishesh set main ek khaas pattern kii khoj jaruri nahin ki pattern kii us puri aabaadi kaa pratinidhitiv kare jisase data liya gaya he
 Therefore, an important part of this process is pattern verification and authentication on other samples of data
 data mining shabd kaa ek sambandhit lekin nakaaratmak arth main bhi prayog kiya gaya he, jahaan yah badi sankhya ke data main spasht lekin jaruri nahin pratinidhi pattern kii suvichaarit khoj, ko ingit karata he
 To avoid confusion with the second sense, the terms data dredging and data snooping are often used
 dhyaan den, ki dreging or snooping ko jab pariklpana ko viksit or spasht kiya ja rahaa ho to ek anveshan ke upkaran ke rup main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Humans have been extracting patterns from data "by hand" for centuries, but the increasing amount of data in modern times has made more automated methods necessary
 aankadon main pattern kii pahchaan ke praarambhik tareekon main shaamil he baes prameya or pratigaman vishleshan 
 computer praudyogiki kaa prasar, sarvavyaapaktaa or badhati shakti ne data sangrahan or bhandaaran ko badha diya he
 As data sets have grown in size and complexity, direct real-time data analysis has been increasingly augmented by indirect, automated data processing
 computer vigyaan main anya khojon dwaara ise or badhaava mila he, jaise neural network, clustering, genetic elgoridam, disizan tree or saport vector mashin 
 data mining, chhipe pattern ko udghaatit karne ke iraade se data par in tareekon ko lagu karne kii prakriya he
 For many years it has been used by industry, scientists and governments to filter the amount of data such as supermarket scanner data to generate aircraft passenger travel records, census data and market research reports
 
 vyavhaar ke nishkarshon ke sangrah ke vishleshan main sahaayta, data mining ke upyog kaa ek mukhya kaaran he
 Such data are sensitive to collinearity due to unknown interrelationships
 data mining kaa ek aprihaary tathy yah he ki vishleshit kiye ja rahe set ke aankade puure domen ke pratinidhi nahin bhi ho sakate hai or isliye ho saktaa he ki isamen kuch mahatvapurn sambandhon or vyavhaaron ke udhaaharan shaamil naa hon jo domen ke anya bhaagon main maujuud hai
 To solve this type of problem, analysis is solved using experiment-based and other methods, such as choice modeling for human-generated data
 in sthitiyon main, antarnihit antarasambandh ko yaa to niyantrit kar sakate hai, yaa puri tarah hataa dete hai, prayogtmak dizin ke nirmaan ke dauraan
 There have been some attempts to define standards for data mining, for example the 1999 European Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining and the 2004 Java Data Mining Standards
 These are evolving standards; Later versions of these standards are still under development
 maanakeekaran ke in prayaason se mukt, khule-strot ke swatantra rup se uplabdh software system jaise rapidminer, Weka, KNIME or r Project, data mining prakriyaaon ko paribhaashit karne ke liye ek anaupchaarik maanak ban gaye hai
 Most of these systems are capable of importing and exporting models in PMML that provide a standard way to present data mining models so that they can be shared between different statistical applications
 PMML is an xml-based language developed by Data Mining Group, an independent group of several data mining companies
 PMML sanskaran 4

 In addition to industry-induced demand for standards and intraoperability, professional and educational activities have also contributed substantially to the development and precision of methods and models; The article, published in the 2008 issue of the International Journal of Information Technology and Decision Making, summarizes the results of a literature survey that identifies and analyzes this development

 There are many nuances in this process, but broadly its steps are to preprocess the raw data, mine the data and interpret the results
 ek baar KDD prakriya kaa uddeshy gyaat hone ke baad, ek lakshya data set ekatrit kiya janaa chahie he
 Since data mining can only reveal patterns already present in the data, the target data set should be large enough to contain these patterns while being so brief that it can be mined within an acceptable time frame
 a common source for data is a datamart or data warehouse
 nirdhaarit lakshya ko tab saaf kiya jaataa he
 Cleansing removes comments with noise and missing data
 saaf data ko feechar vector main parinat kiya jaataa he, prati prekshan ek vector
 ek feechar vector, kachche data prekshan kaa ek sankshipt sanskaran he
 For example, a black and white image of a face that is 100px by 100px would contain 10,000 bits of raw data
 It can be converted into a feature vector by detecting the eye and mouth in the image
 aisa karne se prayek vector ke liye data kam hokar 10,000 bits se loketions ke liye teen code hoga, naatakeey rup se mine kiye jane vaale dataset ke aakaar ko kam karegaa or is tarah prasanskaran ke kaary ko kam karegaa
 chaynit feechar is par nirbhar karegaa ki uddeshy kya he ; jaahir he, "sahi" feechar kaa chunaav safal data mining ke liye aadhaar he
 The feature vectors are divided into two sets, "training set" and "test set"
 The training set is used to train the data mining algorithm, while the test set is used to verify the accuracy of any received pattern
 data mining main saamaanya rup se chaar virgon ke kaary shaamil hai: The final step of knowledge discovery from data is to verify patterns generated by data mining algorithms that occur in a broader data set
 data mining elgoridam dwaara paae gaye sabhi pattern jaruri nahin ki sahi hon
 data mining elgoridam ke liye prashikshan set main pattern kaa pataa lagaana aam he jo saamaanya data set main maujuud nahin hai, ise overfiting kaha jaataa he
 To overcome this, evaluation uses a test set of data on which the data mining algorithm was not trained
 larnt pattern ko is pareekshan set par lagu kiya jaataa he jiske praapt parinaam ko vaanchit parinaam se tulana kii jaati he
 For example, a data mining algorithm that is trying to separate legitimate emails from spam will be trained on a training set of sample emails
 Once trained, the learned pattern will be applied to a test set of emails on which it was not trained, the accuracy of these patterns can be measured by how many emails they have correctly classified
 
 elgorithm ke moolyankan ke liye kai sankhyikeey tareekon kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he jaise ROC karvs
 If the learned patterns do not meet the desired standards, it is necessary to reevaluate and change the preprocessing and data mining
 yadi larnt pattern vaanchit maanakon ko puraa karte hai to antim prakriya un larnt pattern kii vyakhya karnaa or unhen gyaan main badalanaa he
 Beginning in the 1960s, with the availability of oracles for some mixed games, also known as tablebases, in some early configurations, small board dots-and-boxes, small board hexes and some endgame, dots-end in chess

 Businesses adopting data mining may see a return or investment, but they also see that the number of predictive models can grow exponentially
 koun sa graahak pratikriya degaa yah bataane ke liye ek model ke bajaay, ek udyog prayek kshetra or graahak prakaar ke liye ek alag model bana saktaa he
 Instead of sending an offer to all possible people who respond, he would like to send the offer only to customers who are likely to take the offer
 And finally, he would also like to decide which customers will be profitable over a time period and only send offers to those who are likely to be profitable

 dahan karne kii do pranaliyaan vyavhaar main laai jaati hai : The static pressure cycle is found to be good in these two systems
 gaise tarabine main vyavahrut ushmagatiki chakra hai : In the first type of cycle, fresh air from the atmosphere enters the compressor and after working in the turbine is expelled into the atmosphere itself, but in the second type of cycle, fresh air does not come from outside, but the repeated transport of the same air or gas it happens
 tarabine kii dakshata ko badhaane ke liye vibhinn prakaar ke upkaran vyavhaar main laae jate hai, jinamein nimnlikhit mukhya hai : The compressed air enters the compressed air from one side and the gas expelled by the turbine from the other side
 gas sampeedit vaayu se adhik garam hoti he
 That is why thermal gas enters compressed air and the compressed air becomes even more heated
 sampidit vaayu ke adhik garam hone se dahanakaksh main idhan kii kam aavashyaktaa hoti he
 This increases the efficiency of the entire plant
 sampeedan ke kaary main kuch bhi kami hone se uplabdh shakti kii vaddhi ho jaati he, jisase sanyantr kii dakshata bad jaati he
 To reduce the work of compression, the air is compressed into a low pressure compressor and enters the coolant, where its temperature is lowered and sent to be compressed into a high pressure compressor
 pratham tarabine main kaary karne ke baad gas punastaapak main pravesh karti he, jahaan ise punastapit kiya jaataa he
 The gas enters the second turbine to operate from the recirculator
 ye nimnlikhit hai : There are two types of compressors installed in a gas turbine, the axial and the inertial
 akshapravaah sampidak kaa vyavhaar pehle bahut hi kam hota tha, kintu pichley kuch varshon main vayugatiki vigyaan kaa vikaas hone se is tarah ke sampidak kaa dizin saral ho gaya he evam isaki dakshata bhi bad gai he
 This type of compressor is used more in industrial gas turbine, because it gives higher pressure ratio and higher efficiency
 apkendrik sampidak halkaa hone ke kaaran vayuyan main adhik vyavahrut hota he
 As mentioned above, compressed air is heated in this chamber with the help of fuel
 is ang kii dizine atyant najuk evam jatil hoti he
 Work is achieved by this
 tarabine kii sahaayta se sampidak ko chalaaya jaataa he, jisase tarabine main praapt kaary kaa kuch bhaag sampidak ko chalaane main kharch ho jaataa he
 Therefore, the available power = the work received by the turbine - the work spent in the compressor gas tarabine kii ushmiya dakshata tarabine main kaary karanevaale gaise ke praveshtap par nirbhar karti he
 The higher this temperature, the higher the efficiency, but before increasing the heat of the gas, the material treated for the turbine panels must also have the ability to work at that temperature
