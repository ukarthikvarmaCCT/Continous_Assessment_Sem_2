 is tat par aakar jo log based unke adipurush africa ke purvi kinare se aae honge, aisa anumaan kiya jaataa he
 The basis of this presumption is that during the creation of the Himalayas, the landmass of Africa was separated from the western part of India
 is bhugolic navasrujan kii prakriya ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaae to is sambhaavna ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa ki adimanav samooh, jo africa main basataa tha vahi vartmaan saurashtra kahe jane vaale bhu-bhaag main bhi basaa hua tha
 Carefully looking at the map, it becomes clear that these two terrains are separated from each other and the area between them has become the Arabian Sea

 tarangadairghy: 10 km to 1 km Low frequency or LF are radio frequencies that fall between 30 khz – 300 khz
 ise kilometre pattee yaa tarang bhi kehete hai
 Because its wavelength is ten to one kilometer
 a 2
1 khz allocation, the 136 khz band, is available to amateur radio operators in some countries in Europe, New Zealand and French overseas dependencies
 The world record distance for a two-way contact is over 10,000 km from near Vladivostok to New Zealand
 As well as conventional Morse code many operators use very slow computer controlled Morse code or specialized digital communications modes
 a proposal at the WRC-07 World Radiocommunication Conference aims to make this a worldwide amateur radio allocation
 The UK allocated a 2
8 khz sliver of spectrum from 71
6 khz to 74
4 khz beginning in April 1996 to UK amateurs who applied for a notice of variation to use the band on a noninterference basis with a maximum output power of 1 w ERP
 This was withdrawn on 30 June 2003 after a number of extensions in favor of the European-harmonized 136 khz band
 a 1-watt transmission of very slow Morse Code between G3AQC and W1TAG spanned the Atlantic Ocean for 3275 miles on November 21-22, 2001
 In the United States there is a special license free allocation in the longwave range called lowfer
 This experimental allocation between 160 khz and 190 khz is sometimes called the "lost Band"
 Unlicensed operation by the public is permitted south of 60 degrees north latitude, except where interference would occur to ten licensed location service stations located along the coasts
 Regulations for use include a power output of no more than 1 watt, and an antenna / ground-lead length of no more than 15 meters, and a field strength of no more than 4
9 microvolts / meter
 Also, emissions outside of the 160 khz–190 khz band must be attenuated by at least 20 db below the level of the unmodulated carrier
 Many experimenters in this band are amateur radio operators

 a command or 'injunction' is an order which the court shall, under its parity rights, to do something in the name of a party or corporation, to do something, to stop it from doing something or to continue to do such work Issues that he is obliged to do or not to do
 nyaayalay kaa yah aadesh vyakti par vyaktigat rup se lagu hota he is aadesh kaa ulanghan nyaayalay kii manahani mana jaataa he
 If a person defames in this manner, then there is a system of confiscating his property
 bhartiya vidhaan ke antargat jin maamalon main vyakti ko sajaa dena yaa sampatti jabt karnaa prabhavakaari na ho, un maamalon main civil procidyur code aadesh 21 niyam 32 ke anusaar nyaayalay decri paanevaale vaa kisi anya kisi vyakti ko nirdhaarit kaam sampadan karne kaa aadesh de saktaa he
 In this situation, the entire expenditure of performing the said work will have to be borne by the person who was originally ordered to complete the said work
 samadesh sweekaaratmak bhi ho sakati he or nishedhaatmak bhi
 By the admissible or injunctive orders, the defendant is ordered to do something which he is legally bound to do
 nishedhaatmak vaa nirodhak samadesh ke dwaara prativaadee ko kisi kaam ko karne se yaa kisi sthiti ko banaaye rakhane se nivrutt hone kaa aadesh diya jaataa he
 The division of the command into an acceptable or injunctive form depends on the nature of the work in relation to which a judicial instruction is issued
 samadesh ke pun: do vibhaag kiye gaye hai- antarvarti or sthaayee
 This method is divided keeping in mind two things - one is the duration of the order and secondly, at what stage of the judicial process the order is issued
 mote taur par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki antarvarti aadesh vah he jo maamle kii sunwaayee puri hone tak ke liye prabhavakaari hota he
 The permanent injunction is issued after the completion of the case
 sthaayee samadesh jari karne kaa arth he prativaadee ko sadaa ke liye kisi aise adhikaar se vanchit kar dena yaa koi aisa kaam karne se roak dena jo vaadi ke adhikaron ke virodh main ho
 In case of great need, a unilateral command can also be issued only on the application of the plaintiff without taking the statement of the defendant
 kintu is dhang se jari kii gai ekapaksheeya samadesh tab tak asthaayee hi rahegi jab tak ki prativaadee soochnanusaar apana bayaan dene ke liye prastut nahin ho jaataa
 Most of the judicial remedies which are presently in Indian courts, if not all of them, were taken from the English judicial system
 19veen shatabdi ke madhya main ukt nyaayapaddati se sambandhit do tarah ke nyaayalay or doosraa samya nyaayalay samya nyaayalay ko hi chanceri kaa nyaayalay bhi kaha jaataa tha
 The Courts of General Legislature were the general courts of the state
 in nyaayalayon main nyaayavyavastha desh ke pracheen ritirivaajon par aadhaarit hoti thi
 Only those ancient customs were called general justice
 saamaanya yaa samta ke nyaayalay main rahati thi
 It can be said broadly that the flaws in the general justice were clear in the judicial system based on the principle of equity
 saamaanya nyaay ke anusaar sabhi prakaar kii kshatiyon kii purti dravya dwaara kar di jaati thi
 Suppose a has an acre of land which is mixed with the land of 'B' and 'A' contracts with 'B' to the effect that he will give it to 'B' after six months from the date of the agreement
 Will sell and transfer
 tab is pratham qaraar ke ek maheene ke baad 'k' yadi vah bhoomi ek tritiy vyakti 'ga' ke haath bech detaa he to is sthiti main saamaanya kanoon qaraar todane se hui kshati kii purti ke liye keval dravya die jane kaa aadesh de saktaa tha
 On the other hand, in such a situation, the court of equity could not only stop 'A' by issuing the order that he should not sell the land to 'C' but could also make specific instructions that the said land at the appropriate time
 But 'b' should be sold and transferred
 isse spasht ho jaataa he ki saamaanya vidhaan ke is dhang ke dosha ko dur karne kii kitni aavashyaktaa thi
 At the same time, it also shows the extent of jurisdiction of equality justice
 jin sthitiyon main aarthik pratifal samaan rup se upyogi he, un sthitiyon main samta ke antargat vishesh upachaaron kaa prayog nahin kiya jayega
 But if there is a violation of the trust or other such right and the general legislation does not recognize the breach of the said right, then in that case there is a system of special remedies under Samay
 yah siddhant tathaa isse sambandhit upasiddhant samadesh sambandhi kanoon ke kshetra main sarvatra paae jaayenge
 The system of issuing orders, along with many other remedies, has also been brought from England to India through various edicts of the High Courts of India
 bharat ke vishisht avamukti adhinium 1877 ke tritiy bhaag main samadesh ko niyantrit karne vaale tathvik niyamon kaa ullekh he
 Some of the process related matters have been discussed in the Civil Procedure Code of India
 yadi prativaadee vaadi ke sampatti sambandhi adhikaron kaa hanan karata he yaa vaadi ko sampatti ke upbhog se vanchitakarta he yaa is dhang kaa kaam karne kii dhamkee detaa he to nyaayalay neeche likhi sthitiyon main prativaadee ke naam sthaayee samadesh jari kar saktaa he- yadi prativaadee vaadi ke liye sampatti kaa nyaasi ho yaa jab yah jaanane kaa koi saadhan na ho ki prativaadee dwaara vaadi ke sampatti sambandhi adhikaron kaa hanan kiye jane se vastut: kitni kshati hui he, yaa jahaan kshati is dhang kii ho ki uski dravya dwaara pootin se paryaapt avamukti sambhav na ho sake, yaa jahaan is baat kii sambhaavna ho ki kshati kii dravya dwaara purti saadhy nahin he, yaa jahaan nyaayik prakriya ke vistaar ko rokane ke liye samadesh jari karnaa aavashyak ho gaya ho
 The MLA cannot stop any person from making orders to the organization, the command cannot interfere in the relevant work to be done by any department of the government, the command cannot interfere in the state related functions of any foreign government, in matters of crime
 Hearing also cannot be stopped by the command nor can anyone be prevented from breaking such agreement by the command For which he is not particularly committed to subsistence
 yadi praarthi apni anumati se yaa apane kisi vyavhaar se apane aap ko samadesh kaa anadhikari bana detaa he, us sthiti main us vyakti ke paksh main samadesh jari nahin kii jaaegi
 Normally, a government department cannot be prevented from performing its duties, but this does not mean that Indian courts cannot prevent the government or any department of the government from doing or continuing to do illegal work
 kabhi kabhi kisi qaraar ke nirvaah ke liye samadesh aavashyak ho jaati he
 But in such a situation it is necessary that a particular subsistence of that agreement is possible
 vyaktigat seva ke qaraar main isse kuch kathinaayee paidaa ho gai he
 In general, personal services agreements are not typically forcibly implemented
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi koi prasiddh gayak 'k' naamak prekshagrih main paanch saal tak prati din gane kaa qaraar karata he or saath hi yah bhi qaraar karata he ki vah is avadhi main anyatra kahin nahin gaayegaa, lekin ek saal bitne ke baad hi vah ukt prekshagrih main gane se inkaar kar de to is sthiti main nyaayalay us gayak ko 'k' ke prekshagrih main gane ke liye vishesh rup se ajna nahin degaa
 But by granting prohibitory orders, the court can stop the singer from singing elsewhere till the expiry of the prescribed period

 a clear view is expressed from the examples 'C' and 'D' given in section 57 of the Specific Deprivation Act in India
 nishedhaatmak prasanvida sanketapurna ho sakati he or use vyakt karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 In that case the command can be issued even if it results in the defendant being prevented from working elsewhere
 yadi sandhi main kisi anyaaypurna saadhan kaa aashray na liya gaya ho or sanvida ke paalan kii avadhi main koi aisi ghatana na ghat jaae jisase vyaktigat sambandhon main kuch jatilta utpann ho jaae to aisi sthiti main vishisht avamukti adhinium ke is drushtikon ko ki qaraar kaa nirvaah karnaa hi hoga, anya drushtikon kii apeksha variyata di jaani chahie
 In India, generally, Bombay, Madras and Calcutta, these three presidencies did not have a system of extraordinary judicial remedies outside the jurisdiction of the Supreme Courts, writ of writ, inducement etc
 at: samadesh hi ek aisa upachaar tha jiske antargat saadhaaran civil nyaayalay sarkari adhikariyon vaa vibhaagon ke viruddh ajna jari kar sakate the jab ki ve koi aisa kaam karte the jo unke adhikaar ke baahar hota tha yaa avaidhanik hota tha yaa ve is dhang kaa koi kaam karne kii dhamkee dete the
 At some point in America, the command was used against the workers and by this they were compelled to fulfill the agreement made with their employers

 The command in India has never been in trouble in this manner

 Kannada is like other Dravidian languages and Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam are similar to this language
 kannada sanskrit bhashaa se bahut prabhavit he or sanskrit ke bahut saare shabd kannada main bhi usee arth main prayukt hote hai
 The Government of India has also declared Kannada as a classical language of India
 kannada tathaa karnataka shabdon kii vyutpatti ke sambandh main bhinn-bhinn mat hai
 If a scholar is of the opinion that the word Kannada is derived from "kaniruduanadu" meaning "black clay country", then according to other scholars, "kannadu" from "kapitu Nadu" means "fragrant country" and "kannadu" from "kannadu"
 Derivation has taken place
 kannada sahitya ke itihaaskaar aar

 Some grammars state that Kannada is a form of the Sanskrit word "karnat"
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki "karnayo atati iti karnataka" arthath jo kaanon main goonjataa he vah karnataka he
 In ancient texts, the words Kannada, Karnat, Karnataka have been used in synonyms

 In the second century Tamil poem titled "shilappadikaram", the name of the Kannada speakers is "karunadar"

 Kodagu is spoken in Kurg and the other three are prevalent in Nilgiri district

 praarambhik kannada kaa likhit rup shilalekhon main miltaa he
 Among these inscriptions, the inscription found from a place called Hulmidi is the oldest, which dates to 450 AD
 saatvin shatabdi main likhe gaye shilalekhon main badaami or shravan belgol ke shilaalekh mahatvapurn hai
 Often prose is used only in pre-eighth century inscriptions and later inscriptions have excellent specimens of poetry containing poems
 in shilalekhon kii bhashaa jahaan sugathit tathaa praudh he vahaan usapar sanskrit kaa gaharaa prabhaav dikhaai detaa he
 Thus even though there is evidence of prose-poetry in Kannada based on inscriptions dating back to the 8th century, the work of writing in Kannada progressed after the name of the first available Kannada text, "kaviraj Marg", and the language continued to develop

 dwipaksheeya rajnay kaa taatpary he - 'do pakshon ke madhya sambandh'
 Diplomacy between two states is called bilateral diplomacy
 rajnay ke dwaara do rajyon ke bich kii samasyaon ko hal kiya jaataa he
 If national problems are complex, then solutions can be resolved by a conference between the two states
 rajnay kaa saamaanya, saral tathaa sidh maarg yah he ki videsh vibhaag tathaa inke dwaara niyukt rajdoot samasyaon ke samaadhaan aapas main baatcheet dwaara kar lete hai
 In this way, the relations of the states keep going smoothly
 rajyon ke madhya parsparik vyaktigat sampark donon ke madhya sambandhon ko madhur banaata he
 Diplomatic relations between states have been in place since time immemorial
 ye utane hi pracheen hai jitne kii rajya
 In ancient times, when there were differences between the states, the representatives of the two countries found a solution to the problem and tried to end the differences
 aadhunik yug main bhi aisa hi kiya jaataa he or ise dwipaksheeya rajnay kaa naam diya gaya he
 Before the First World War, only smart, capable and efficient ambassadors made relations between the states
 rajyon ke madhya matbhedon athwa samasyaon ko dur karne ke liye kai baar do rajyon ke rajdhyaksh swayan baatcheet kar lete the
 The “simla Agreement” of 1970 is an example of this
 yah samjhauta bharat dwipaksheeya evam bahupaksheeya rajnay, sthaayee mishan : kaary evam bhoomika 201 or pakistan ke madhya hua tha
 The agreement was signed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on behalf of India and President Mr
 Bhutto on behalf of Pakistan
 isi prakaar sheet yuddh kii samaapti karne ke liye america tathaa rus kii dwipaksheeya vaarta dwaara yah sambhav hua
 The biggest argument in support of bilateral diplomacy is that the Head of State or Prime Minister can reach out to solve the problem at any place
 kai vidwaan iske vishay main bhi tark dete hai ki dwipaksheeya vaarta se samasya kaa hal nahin ho paata balki samasya or badhati he
 The noted 15th-century ambassador Philip D
 Comines said that "two kings who want to establish a sweet personal relationship should not meet each other directly
" vyaktigat pratyaksh vaarta main is baat kaa char rahata he ki rajdhyaksh kahin ek duusare ke virdohi na ho jaayen
 Henry VIII and Charles v started hating each other due to bilateral diplomacy
 dwipaksheeya rajnay kaa upbhog kabhi-kabhi praachaar ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 In such a situation it becomes a means of victory in the hands of an ambitious leader and not the basis of a just agreement
 praayah yah dekha gaya he ki is prakaar kii vaarta main na to nirnay puure liye jate hai or jo nirnay liye jate hai unhen samay kii kami ke kaaran unako adhinsth adhikariyon par chhod diya jaataa he
 This is one of the reasons why Russia and America could not have good relations
 dwipaksheeya rajnay dwaara kabhi-kabhi vyaktigat sampark se do deshon ke madhya maitri sambandh drudh ho jate hai
 Direct and quick decisions can be taken by this type of conference which is appropriate to solve the problem of that time
 yadi nirnay nahin bhi liye jate to rajanyik pratyanon se samjhaute kaa rup le saktaa he
 a bilateral conference is a good tool to understand international problems well, to understand one's own and others' perspectives
 iske madhyam se lokapriyata bhi praapt kii ja sakati he
 a drawback of bilateral diplomacy is that decisions are taken quickly by it, which lacks complete and mature ideas
 har paksh apni suvidhanusaar in nirnyon kaa alag-alag matlab lagaataa he
 Their decision is also avoided in implementation
 aaj ke kisi bhi ati vyast rajdhyaksh ke paas itnaa samay nahin hota ki vah jatil samasyaon ko samaj sake
 The result is that such conferences fail
 nehru-liyakat pact ek aisa hi sammelan tha jiske parinamswaroop bharat-paak ke sambandh madhur hone ke bajaay bigade
 Even in the 1960 Paris conference, relations between Russia and the US deteriorated instead of being friendly
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke baad dwipaksheeya rajnay kaa aaj ke yug main mahatv kam hota ja rahaa he
 It has now been replaced by multilateral diplomacy

2001 kii yah bahut lokapriy film rahi
 Its DVD sales were the highest till 2007
 yah film 19ve sadi main basii angrez raaj ke daur kii ek kehani he
 Bhuvan, a resident of Champaner village, is an enthusiastic and idealistic youngster
 madhya pranto kii angrez chhavnee ke senapati, captain rassal ke saath uski nahi banati thi
 When the British ordered to collect the year's revenue, then the villagers went to the British camp with Bhuvan to beg Raja Puran Singh to forgive the rent
 vahaan raja, british afasaron kaa cricket kaa khel dekh rahe the
 When an officer abused a villager, Bhuvan quarreled with the officers and equaled the game of cricket with gilli-danda
 raja ke samaksh bhuvan ne kathor lagaan ke kilaaf apana virodh darj kiya
 Captain Russell did not like this and challenged Bhuvan to play cricket
 jite to salbhar kaa lagaan maaf, haare to lagaan tiguna!!! gaanvvaale to is chunauti mukarana chaahate the, magar captain rassal ne ye faisalaa sirf bhuvan ke haathon main saunpa
 To increase the challenge further, he also gave the greed to forgive the three-year rent
 bhuvan ne maidan par dwandv kaa nyotaa sweekaar kar liya
 Now as if Champaner wanted to crucify Bhuvan
 sabaki zindagi to ab tabah hone ja rahi thi
 But for Bhuvan, so long as i breath
 kai saalon se sookhaa chal rahaa tha
 After all, where would you have paid even a year's rent? And then even Captain Russell was not going to be challenged
 agavaani karte huye bhuvan ne lakdi kaa balla or gend banaae
 Except for a group of few people, the whole village was laughing at the game of Bhuvan
 cricket seekhney yah dal chori chupe chhavnee par jane laga
 There, Captain Rasel's sister Elizabeth saw him hiding in the bushes
 use apane bhai kaa gaanvvasiyon se vyavhaar pasand nahin aayaa
 She started teaching crickets to the village players on the field near the village
 hindi bhashaantar ke liye ek naukar bhi chhavnee se apane saath le aati
 Gradually, spontaneously, this team of Bhuvan started learning the game of cricket in its own unique way
 haath majboot karne ve lakdi katate
 The field learners followed the hens and caught them
 goli apane haath pawan chakki kii tarah ghuma gendbaazi karne laga
 Now the people of the village also started showing enthusiasm and Akhir became ten players
 ek din khelte vakt gend kachra ke paas giri
 Garbage was the untouchable cleaning servant of the village
 lautaate vakt usne gend is tarah ghumaakar phanki kii bhuvan dang rah gaya
 The village team got the eleventh selection
 magar gaanv vaale ek achhut ko kis tarah apanaate? ve to use choote tak nahin
 Bhuvan criticized the village and this tradition, which lasted for centuries
 bhuvan ke bhav bhare shabdon se gaanv ke nivasi maan gaye
 Finally the day of combat woke up
 saare praant se log khel dekhne aae
 Captain Rasal's senior officer was also present
 khel teen dino kaa nishchit kiya gaya tha
 The villagers first started throwing the ball
 unka shriganesh achhchhaa hua
 Soon a wicket fell from Renaut
 goli kii anokhi gend faikane kii adaa se ghabadaa kar ek or gora khiladi out hua
 But the British players were also no less
 dheer-dhire ve pari sambhalate gayi
 Suddenly the garbage ball kept rolling
 lakh ne to kai kach bhi gawaae
 At the end of the first day, the white group was dominating
 us raat olizabath ne chhavnee main lakh ko captain rasal se milte dekh liya
 Now it was found that Lakha was cheating from the villagers
 olizabath gaanvvasiyon ko cricket kii talim detii thi yah baat captain rasal ko bataa di
 It was also told that he also lost the catch deliberately
 jab gaanvvasiyon ko pataa chalaa to lakh kii khaal oodhedna chahte the
 Lakha escaped from them and took refuge in the village temple
 lakh ne kubul kiya kii bhuvan se jalan ke kaaran usne yah dhokhebaazi kii
 He also wanted Gauri like Bhuvan but Gauri liked Bhuvan
 ek mauka or lakh ko diya gaya
 The next day Lakha made tremendous catches
 kachra bhi apana jaadu phir chalaane laga
 He took three wickets in three balls simultaneously
 goron kii pari kareeb tinsau ran par samaapt hui
 Bhuvan's team started the batting vigorously
 british sena ke bhootpurv sipaahi deva kamanaseebi se out ho gayi
 Then the British players condemned the village batsmen and threw them out and they soon started getting out
 doosraa din khatm hua or aadhe ran banane abhi baaki the
 Meanwhile, half the team was out
 magar bhuwan abhi khel me jivit tha
 On the third day Baid Ishwar Kaka of the village and Ismail supported Bhuvan
 ismail ko to pichle din chot lagi thi
 Both batted very strongly
 dono ran-out ho gayi
 Now the garbage took the bat
 bhuvan ne bahut koshish kii ki zyaada ballebaazi vahi sanbhale
 The trash required six runs on the last ball
 magar vah ek hi ran le paaya
 Are the villagers losers? The umpire made a no-ball gesture
 ab ek or gend kaa samana bhuvan ne jhela
 Bhuvan hit a six and the village prevailed
 or saath hi barsaat bhi shuru hui
 Captain Russell was sent by his superiors to Central Africa
 olizabath landhan lauti
 Weeping wept farewell to the weeping Bhuvan and the people of the village
 film ke ant me ek parshvavaani bataati he ki captain rassal kii badali africa hui or olizabath sari zindagi swayam ko bhuwan kii radha maan kar, kanvaari rahi

80 crore rupees harshcharit sanskrit main banbhatta dwaara rachit ek granth he
 It depicts the biography of Indian emperor Harshavardhana
 aitihaasik kathanak se sambandhit yah sanskrit kaa sabase pracheen granth he
 The cheerful available at this time is divided into eight sorrows
 jisamen se pehle dhai uchhvas baan kii aatmakatha rup main hai
 Then there is a description of the Punyabhuti dynasty of Sthanishwar, in which Harsha's father Prabhakarvardhan was born
 baan ne prabhakarvardhan kii putree rajyashri or kannaujadhipati grahaverma maukhari ke vivaah kaa varnan kiya he
 By sending his eldest son Rajavardhan to kill the Huns, Prabhakarvardhan became feverish
 baan ne uske rog, mrityu, dah-sanskaar evam samragi yashomati ke aatmadah kaa varnan kiya he
 Then, after hearing about the invasion of Kannauj of Gaur and Malava forces and the killing of Graha Varma, Rajyavardhana moved towards Kannauj
 shatruon ne hathiyaar daal die
 But played smartly
 rajyavardhan ko shatru shivi main aamantrit kiya gaya or unki nirmam hatya kar di gai
 Harsha vowed to avenge the murder of his brother-in-law and brother and proceeded towards Kannauj
 harsh kii badhati hui sena ke saamne shatru bhaag niklaa
 Hearing this, there was no end to Harsha's astonishment that Rajyashree left from captivity and went towards Vindhyachal
 bahut parishramyukt khoj ke pashchaat harsh ne aatmadah karne ko tatpar rajyashri ko divakar mitra rishi ke ashram ke paas paaya or ganga ke tat par apane shivi main le aayaa
 Here the script ends abruptly
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki baan kaa vichaar harsh ke charitra ko purnroopen likhane kaa nahin tha
 He wanted to write only one part of it because he told his listeners' Harsha's life cannot be described even in hundreds of lives
 yadi aap uskaa ek ansh sunanaa chaahate ho to main taiyaar hoon
 It is also rightly said that 'joyful' is only an incident in Harsha's life because the historical knowledge available from Harsha Charit is very less
 parantu is granth kii samalochna karte hue hamen ise aitihaasik rachana ke rup main nahin dekhnaa chahie
 In fact, it is more appropriate to call it a poem with historical plot
 lekhak kii purna shakti kavy-pratibha kaa pradarshan karne par hi kendrit he or aitihaasikta unke liye gaun he
 He has not even given the names of Bhoota Gaur and Malav kings, who represent the masterpiece

 bajirao dwitiya, san 1796 se 1818 tak maratha samrajya ke peshwa the
 During his time the Maratha Empire began to decline
 inke shasankaal main angrejon ke saath sangharsh shuru hua
 Bajirao II was the eighth and last Peshwa
 vah raghunatharav kaa putr tha
 Bajirao II always hated his Prime Minister Nana Fadnavis
 naanaa fadanvis kii mrityu ke baad vah swayan hi maratha samrajya kii satta sambhaalanaa chahta tha
 Bajirao II was a queer and treacherous man, who obtained the rank of Peshwa with the help of the British
 parantu angrezon ke saath bhi vah sachcha siddh nahin hua
 Due to his deception and dishonesty, the British sent him captive to Bithoor, where he died in 1853 AD
 bajirao dwitiya ne angrezon se mitrataa karke unki sahaayta se 'peshwa' kaa pad praapt kiya tha or uske liye kai maratha kshetra angrezon ko de diye
 Bajirao II was a selfish and inept ruler and, being ambitious, was jealous of his prime minister Nana Fadnavis
 fadanvis kii mrityu 1800 i
 main ho gai or bajirao swayan hi satta sambhaalane ke liye aatur ho uthaa
 But he was devoid of military virtues and queer personally and believed that only through deceit could be achieved his goal
 naanaa fadanvis kii mrityu ke baad uske rikt pad ke liye daulataraav shinde or jaswantraav holkar main pratidwandvita shuru ho gai
 Bajirao II wanted to keep these two under his control by deceit, which further complicated the matter
 shinde or holkar ne peshwa ko apane niyantran main lene ke liye puna ke phatakon ke baahar yuddh shuru kar diya
 Bajirao II supported Shinde, but Holkar's army defeated the combined forces of both of them
 bhaybheet peshwa bajirao dwitiya ne 1801 i
 main basai bhagkar angrezon kii sharan lee or vahiin ek angrezi jahaaz par basai kii sandhi, 31 disambar, 1802 par hastakshar kar diye
 By this he accepted to be a dependent of the East India Company
 angrezon ne bajirao dwitiya ko rajdhani puna main pun: sattashin karne kaa vachan diya or peshwa kii raksha ke liye usne rajya main paryaapt sena rakhane kii zimmedaari lee
 In return, the Peshwa agreed to give so much Maratha territory to the company, which brought the expenses of the company's army
 usne yah bhi vaayada kiya ki vah apane yahan angrezon se shatruta rakhane vaale anya europea desh ke logon ko naukari par nahin rakhega
 Thus, Bajirao II sold his freedom to the British for his protection
 maratha saradaaron ne basai kii sandhi ke prati apana rosh prakat kiya, kyonki unhen laga ki peshwa ne apni kaayarata ke kaaran un sabhi kii swatantraaa bech di he
 So they prepared for war to end this objectionable treaty
 parinamswaroop dwitiya angl-maratha yuddh hua, jisamen angrezon kii jeet hui or maratha kshetron par unki prabhusatta sthapit ho gai
 Peshwa Bajirao did not like the restrictions imposed by the treaty
 usne maratha saradaaron main vyaapt rosh or asantosh kaa faaydaa uthaakar unhen angrezon ke viruddh dubaara sangathit kiya
 In November 1817, the organized Maratha army under the leadership of Bajirao II looted the 'english Residency' of Poona and attacked the English army at Khadki position, but was defeated
 tadnantar vah do or ladaaiyon - 1 janvari 1818 main bhima koregaon kii ladai, jisame angrejo ne apni sena ,jo sankhya main maratha se kam the ,jinamein 500 mahaar sainik bhi the, ne peshwa ke 27,000 maratha sainikon ko parajeet kiya tha or ek maheene ke baad ashti kii ladaai main parajeet hua
 He tried to escape, but on 3 June 1818, he had to surrender to the British
 angrezon ne is baar peshwa kaa pad hi samaapt kar diya or bajirao dwitiya ko apdasth karke bandi ke rup main kanpur ke nikat bithur bhej diya jahaan 1853 i
 main uski mrityu ho gai
