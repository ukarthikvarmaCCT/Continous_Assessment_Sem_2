 rabart oven ek samaaj-sudhaarak evam udhyami the
 He is counted among the founders of socialism and cooperative movement
 sahakaarita ke janak rabart oven ke bare main kuch kehane se purv hamen samaran karnaa hoga ki vah sahakaarita ke siddhant kaa moulik vichaarak nahin tha
 Even before that many economists had expressed their views in favor of decentralization of economic resources
 yahaan tak ki sahakaarita ke paryaay saahchary kaa shabd kaa udai bhi ho chukaa tha
 But this does not reduce the contribution of Robert Owen
 His importance is that he tried to make co-operation on the ground of practicality with all his sincerity and strength
 apane vichaaron ke liye sadaiv samarpit bhav se kaam karata rahaa
 However, he eventually succumbed to failure; But by then the world had become fully aware of the power of cooperation
 oven kaa janm 14, may 1771 ko centralwalls ke ek saadhaaran-se kasbe nutoun main hua tha
 Owen's father, one of seven siblings, was an ordinary businessman
 lohe ke aujaaron kii bikri kii dukaan thi unki
 jabaki maa kaa sambandh ek sampann kisaan parivaar se tha
 Owen's childhood passed through dense deprivation
 His education started well, but before he could complete, he had to leave school at the age of nine
 He moved to London with his eldest brother William in search of work
 usko pehali naukari lankashair main darji ke rup main mili
 Owen continued to learn work there for a few years
 usase aage ke nau varsh oven ne naukari karte hue bitaye
 dhire-dhire usne kuch rakam or kuch sapane bhi jamaa kiye
 In the meantime, the ambitions which had been submerged for some time, began to raise their heads again
 bhaap ke ingine kaa avishkaar usase kuch hi varshon pehle hua tha, bhapashakti se chalane vaale karghon ke kaaran kapadaa udyog main kranti ai hui thi
 That is why Manchester's textile industry was a big name in those days
 1790 ke aakhri maheenon main oven ne apane bade bhai wiliam se sau pound kii rakam udhaar lee
 One day he reached Manchester, adorned with a beautiful dream of his ambitions
 apni maamuli-si puunji se usne jone ke saath milakar ek dhaage kii juutiyaan bunane ke chote-se kaarkaane kii shuruyaat kii
 Joan used to work as a mechanic before that
 kaam ko dekhte hue sau pound kii puunji bahut kam thi
 Owen's match with tough majors did not last
 is bich jone ke saath saajhedaari nibhaane main bhi samasyaayein aane lagi thim
 So Owen laid the foundation for his separate factory by breaking up his partnership with Joan in a span of three months
 oven use chaalu rakhane ke liye sangharsh kar hi rahaa tha ki manchester ke ek bade kaarkaane main prabandhak kaa pad rikt hone kii soochna use mili
 He gave up the greed of his mill and went to that job
 us samay uski umr keval ikis varsh thi
 It was the beginning of continuous struggle and success in a way
 mehnatee or lagansheel to vah tha hi
 In a short span of six months, he was able to coin his working style on the mind and heart of the mill owner
 us kaarkaane main us samay paanch sau majdoor kaam karte the
 This was a major achievement for Owen, but it was the beginning of his successes in the true sense
 raat-din ke kathin parishram, pratibha or lagan se oven ne us kaarkaane ko kuch hi varshon main britain ke sarvshereshth kaarkaanon main laa diya
 Owen's entrepreneurial estimate can be gauged from an example of how he imported cotton from the American islands to his factory
 vah dakshini rajyon se pehla rooyee kaa pehla aayaat tha
 Not only this, Owen also achieved remarkable efficiency in cotton spinning
 nirvivaad rup se uskaa kaarkaana tatkaaleen britain ke sarvshereshth katai kaarkaanon main se ek tha; jisaki safalataa kaa shrey yadi kisi ko diya ja saktaa he to vah keval oven hi tha
 Twenty-one-year-old Tarun Owen became manager and shareholder of the large textile mill Callerton Twist Company on one side of Manchester in 1795; Due to which his name was counted among the most successful entrepreneurs there
 unheen dinon oven ko apni factory ke kaary se new lenark janaa padaa, jo apni bhugolic sthiti ke kaaran vastra udyog ke liye bahut hi upyukt sthaan tha
 By then he had become a Sudarshan youth
 vastutah oven ko khabar mili thi ki new lenark ke prasiddh kapadaa vyavsaayee david del apni kapadaa milon kaa sauda karnaa chaahate hai
 David Dale was known for being a visionary and successful entrepreneur
 oven kii khyaati un tak pahunch chuki thi
 Dale was mesmerized by his unmatched talent and dedication
 new lenark pahunchate hi oven ke jivan main ek or sukhad mode aayaa
 David Dale had a daughter - Carolina Dale
 Young Owen fell in love with him
 karolina bhi uske aakarshan se batch na saki
 David Dale not only deals with Owen a part of the textile mills, but also marries his daughter to him
 yah sitambar, 1799 kii ghatana thi, jisane oven ko ek saath kai uplabdhiyon se lad diya
 After marriage, Owen started living there
 new lenark kii vah factory del or richard archeride ne 1784 main prarambh kii thi
 The factory was one of the largest textile mills in New Lenark at the time; Water power was used to run it
 do hajaar se adhik karmchaaree usamen kaary karte the; jinamein se lagbhag paanch sau garib pariwaron ke bachche the
 Most of the children were aged between five and six
 yahi sthiti un dinon adhikansh kapadaa milon main thi
 Although David Dale took full care of the child laborers, the condition of the workers, especially the child laborers, remained unfortunate due to no effective system
 adhikansh kaamgaar behad garib, ashikshit pariwaron se sambhddha the
 Due to illiteracy, frustration and frustration, many evils like theft, gambling, alcoholism and intoxication had entered his life
 ghar ke naam par un sabhi ke paas ek-ek cameraa hota tha, chota-sa or ganda bhi, jisamen svachh hawa kaa pravesh bhi asambhav tha
 There was no arrangement for the treatment of the sick, even if the system of education of children was far away
 us samay tak oven khub sampannataa evam samruddhi bator chukaa tha
 After marriage, her confidence also increased
 parantu oven kii mahattvakankshaon kaa ant abhi dur tha
 Her future was to be decided on the basis of this self-confidence, as it was her self-confidence that inspired her to take drastic decisions, which enabled her to struggle for her thoughts and objectives for a lifetime
 apane krantikari faislon ke liye oven ne apane sarkaar or udyogpatiyon kii aalochanaayen sahin
 uske hissedaar use chhodkar chale gaye
 The wealth of crores of rupees which he had earned through hard work, gradually got lost in his welfare schemes
 lekin itihaas main alag chalane, nayaa kaary karne, aane vaali pidiyon ke liye nae pratimaan gadhane vaale mahapurushon ke liye yah koi nayaa nahin he
 The court of history takes pride in saving great men who have overcome similar challenges
 oven kora vyavsaayee nahin tha
 He also had a beautiful and sensitive mind, which got distracted on seeing others in distress
 vah swayan garib parivaar se aayaa tha
 For this reason he was well aware of the constraints and sufferings of poverty
 un dinon new lenark main jahaan bade-bade kaarkaanon kii bharmaar thi, vahiin uske aasapaas garib mazdooron kii choti-choti anek bastiyaan bhi basii hui thim
 Life there was hellish
 oven ko lag rahaa tha ki utpaadakta main apekshit vruddhi kaarigaron or mazdooron ke rahan-sahan tathaa unki paristhitiyon main sudhaar kiye bina sambhav nahin he
 Therefore, he spent the next ten years of his life improving the condition of laborers
 usne mazdooron kii awaas-bastiyon kaa uddhaar kiya
 In these settlements, he himself tried to get rid of the dirty habits of the workers
 balshramikon ke kaary-ghante kam kar, unki shiksha evam manoranjan kaa prabandh kiya
 Arranged separate restrooms and maternity centers for women laborers
 in prayaason se ek ore to mazdooron ke jivan main sudhaar aayaa, abhi tak jo majdoor audyogikeekaran ko andeh kii drushti se dekhte the, unke vichaaron main parivartan bhi hua
 Their resentment towards the new system began to diminish
 parinamtah utpaadan badha, uskaa laabh bhi oven ko mila
 It is noteworthy that all the steps Owen took for the welfare of his employees were behind his pure business vision
 ek daksh udhyami kii bhaanti vah sthitiyon kaa apane paksh main mode lene main paarangat tha
 Fred Marx, an associate of Marx and Marxist thinker, explicitly mentioned in his famous article — Socialism: Utopian and Scientific— oven kaa yahi sochna tha
 In comparison, he made efforts to provide a better environment for his employees, but they were far away from the all-round development of his personality and intellect
 unhen apane vivek kaa istemaal karne kii chhot bahut kam, vishisht sandarbhon tak simit thi
 The reformists were influenced by Owen
 vah menchester kii Literary and Philosophical Society kaa sammanit sadsy tha
 Owen, influenced by the Scottish Renaissance movement, believed that a person's personality is influenced and constructed by his environment
 isliye vaataavaran main sudhaar dwaara vyaktitv kaa parishkar kiya ja saktaa he
 'education is the engine of contact with the moral world
 ’ shiksha ke mahatva ko rekhaankit karti kisi itihaaskaar kii is ukti kaa vah samarthak tha
 Demonstrating the imperative of education for personality building, he said that- un dinon adhikansh kaarkaana maalikon dwaara apane mazdooron ko nakad mazdooree dene ke bajaae vastuvinimay pranali ke aadhaar par bhugtan kiya jaataa tha
 Accordingly, tokens were given to the workers; Outside the group of factory owners there was no cost
 un token ke badale majdoor tayshuda dukaanon se aavashyak vasteen kharid sakate the
 They were also openly exploited in those shops to take advantage of the helplessness of the laborers
 vahaan milane vaala saamaan ghatiya or bazaar kii apeksha mahangaa hota tha
 When the voice began to be raised against that evil practice, the British Parliament declared it illegal and banned it
 mazdooron kii samasya ko dekhte hue oven ne ek upabhokta centre kii shuruyaat kii jahaan acchhee gunvattta kaa saamaan laagat-mulya se kuch hi upar kaa bhugtan karne par praapt ho saktaa tha
 He also took necessary steps for the character development of laborers
 yah jaanate hue ki majdoor apni kamai kaa bada hissaa sharaab tathaa nashe kii anya vastuon par lutaa dete hai, oven ne unki bikri ko kade niyantran main rakh diya
 Not only this, Owen also encouraged his workers to buy wholesale from consumer stores; So that they can save more
 Emphasizing on savings, he asked the laborers to save a part of their income for difficult times
 He created better conditions for child labor
 unke kaaryghante sunishchit kiye tathaa anivaary shiksha ke liye paathshaalaayein khulawaain
 oven ke upabhokta bhandar ko paryaapt safalataa mili
 This later inspired the consumer movement of the cooperative sector 
 haalanki sahakaarita par aadhaarit upabhokta kendron kii safal shuruyaat uske lagbhag chaar dashak pashchaat ho saki, jab roshadel pynirs ne landan ke todlan ilaake main pehla upabhokta centre sthapit kiya
 In those days mill workers had to work continuously for at least eleven hours per day
 oven ne usame ek ghanta pratidin kii katautee kar di
 This step was courageous as well as miraculous under the circumstances
 uske is kadam kaa duusare udyogpatiyon ne jamkar virodh kiya
 Articles criticizing Owen's move were published in newspapers and magazines nurtured by the capitalists
 isse ghabaraae bina oven ne das varsh se chote bacchon ke apni mil main kaam karne par pabandi laga di
 He provided them housing facilities in the factory itself while expanding welfare facilities for mill-workers
 saath hi aspataal, vishramalaya or manoranjangrihon kii sthapana kii
 In those days, the laborers had to bear the brunt of the mistakes made during the work, due to which large part of their salary was left to compensate for the loss
 oven ne aise jurmaane kii parampara ko samaapt kar diya, jiskaa duusare udyogpatiyon ne kaaphi virodh kiya
 But Owen was firm on his decision
 oven kaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn yogadan bacchon kii shiksha kaa prabandh karnaa tha
 He founded the Shishu Vidyalayas and along with being the father of co-operatives, he became the innovator of the child education program
 paanch saal ke bacchon ke liye shiksha anivaary karte hue usne ek kranti kaa shubharambh kiya
 It all started by Owen based only on his inner motivation; Which was strongly welcomed towards the working class
 dhyaan dene kii baat he ki mazdooron ke liye awaas-bastiyon ke nirmaan, aspataal, vishramalaya, manoranjangrihon tathaa shishu paathshaalaon ke nirmaan par oven kaa bahut-sa dhan kharch ho rahaa tha
 No one had made such a huge investment on labor welfare programs before
 isliye prarambh main logon ko oven kaa vyavhaar paagalpan jaisaa laga
 The adversaries used to make fun of Owen one day in his prejudiced brain, making fun of Owen
 But with time, people started to understand everything
 majdoor kalyaan kaaryakramon main lakhon pound kharch kar dene ke baavjood oven kii factriyaan lagaataar munafa ugal rahi thim, balki uske laabh main nirantar vruddhi ho rahi thi
 At the same time, his popularity and fame were also increasing steadily
 oven kii kuch yojanaayen behad kharchili siddh huin thim
 Due to which his stakeholders started protesting
 saajheedaar kaarkaane ko saamaanya tareeke se chalaanaa chaahate the
 Fed up with him, Owen started a new company, in which he had arranged that twenty-twentieth of the profits would be spent on fixed philanthropic programs
 Jeremy Bantham, William Allen became Owen's partner in the new company
 aise vichaarkon ke saath mil jane se oven ke janhitaishi kaaryakramon ko lokaprratishtha milani nishchit hi thi
 In the meantime Owen had matured ideologically as well
 bantham ke vichaaron se vah pehle hi prabhavit tha
 Expressing his views, he wrote a long article New View of Society, Or, Essays on the Principle of the Formation of the Human Character, and the Application of the Principle to Practice
 kai kishton main likhi gai us lekhamala main oven ke samaajawaadee vichaaron kii jhalak ekadam saaf thi
 Owen's faith in socialism continued to grow
 bantham mukt bazaar-vyavastha kaa samarthak tha
 He believed that workers should have the right to choose their favorite trader or producer for themselves
 There should not be any direct or indirect pressure on it
 tab tak oven kii khyaati bahut bad chuki thi
 Along with this, his influence on the local administration
 He was not deterred by the constant opposition from industrialists for reform programs
 ulate usne shramik-adhikaron ke sangrakshan ke liye vaidhanik vyavasthaaen karne ke apane prayaas tej kar die
 Owen also made a lot of efforts to reduce the working hours of child labor
 parantu is kaam main keval naakamayaabi hi uske haath lagi; kyonki tab tak yathasthiti banaae rakhane ke pakshdhar udyogpati or unke samarthak adhikarigan oven ke prakhar virdohi ban chuke the
 By then Owen's fame had crossed the boundaries of Britain
 shramik kalyaan kii vaanchhaa rakhane vaale desh, oven ke lokahitaishi kaaryakramon kaa kriyanvayan apane yahaan karnaa chaahate the
 The erstwhile rulers of Russia, Holland, Prussia had started labor reform programs in consultation with Owen
 oven ke sudhaar-kaaryakramon ko majdoor varg kii ore se bharpoor samarthan mila tha
 The profits of his factories had increased surprisingly
 duusare udyogpati jo oven ke sudhaar kaaryakramon ko uskaa aatmghaatee kadam bataa rahe the, oven ne ek hi saal main saath hajaar pound kamakar unki bolti band kar di
 He showed that exploitation, dishonesty or cut-throat competition is not necessary for earning
 yadi durandeshi se kaary kiya jaae to sahyog or parsparik sahanubhuti se bhi pragati ke lakshya kii prapti sambhav he
 Owen was also angered by the root beliefs imposed in the name of religion
 uskaa yah maananaa tha ki jivan main dharm kaa atirek purna hastkshep manushya ko taarkik nirnay lene se roktaa he ki majdoor varg kii dayaneey sthiti kaa kaaran ve roodhiyaan bhi hai, jinhen vah dharm ke naam par paale hue hai
 Therefore, in his writings he strongly criticized religious beliefs
 parinaam yah hua ki padri or dharmasatta par aseen duusare prabhaavshaalee log uske viruddh lambandh hone lage
 He had already angered the capitalist class due to its welfare programs
 isliye swaarthee udhyamiyon tathaa dharm ke thekedaaron ne oven ke viruddh abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kar di
 This in turn led to Owen's reputation being shocked
 oven sahi myne main ek mahaan swapndrushtaa tha
 The dream of a better world was always shimmering in his eyes
 jivan ke praarambhik varshon main hi dharm ke uski aasthaa samaapt ho chuki thi
 He believed that conditions like heaven are not possible beyond the earth
 bade log yadi thode se tyaag or doordarshita se kaam len to is dharti ko hi swarg samaan banaaya ja saktaa he
 The basis of his thinking was that man makes his personality not for himself, but for himself, that is, some way others contribute to his achievements and personality building
 atah yah manushya kaa kartavya he ki baaki logon ke saath puraa-puraa sahyog kare taaki adhiktam logon kaa bhala ho sake
 Along with being a dreamer, he was also determined
 usne apni aalochana kii parvaah kiye bina apni yojanaon par kaam kiya
 In addition to the programs of labor welfare, he declared education as compulsory for children and took credit for being the beginning of child education institutions
 samaaj kii behatari ke liye usne or bhi anek prayog kiye; jinamein puunji ke saath-saath bahumoolya samay bhi laga
 Although Owen could not get the expected success due to his opponents, he also unsuccessfully explored the paths on which many future developments were to be written - and which were to be followed by the whole world
 san atharah sau pandrah main aarthik mandi kaa daur chalaa
 oven ke liye sudhaar kaaryakramon ko aage chalaanaa kathin ho gaya
 So he had to postpone his schedule for a few days
 By then, Owen had become familiar with the flaws in the system
 use lag rahaa tha ki poonjivadi vyavastha or shoshan ek hi sikke ke do pahalu hai
 To climb the capitalist system it is necessary that there is discontent and directionlessness in the society
 bhukh, bekaari, garibi or nirakshartaa jo aam aadmi ko bebas banaate hon, ek kaamyaab udyogpati ke liye munaafe kaa mahal khadaa karne main sahaayak hote hai
 The ignorance and insincerity of the public become the catalyst for the expansion of capitalism
 usko apane samay kii saamaajik-aarthik vishmata dekhakar uske liye jimmedaar vyavastha se ub or niraashaa hone lagi thim
 He was convinced that a complete change in the system is necessary for a better tomorrow
 isliye ki vartmaan vyavastha puunji ke kendriyakaran or tajjanit shoshan ko badhaava dene vaali he
 The mood of the oven is easily exposed by these words - yah us sangharkshil, swapndrushtaa, karmath or duuradrushtaa udhyami ke vichaar the jo apni udhyamshiltaa kaa loha desh-videsh main manavaa chukaa tha
 That too due to his unique reform-programs, in which he spent his money and resources
 jaahir he ki poonjivadi vyavastha kii samast khamiyaan oven ke saamne aa chuki thim
 He was convinced that the progressive society whose image is in his eyes is not possible by the capitalist system or with his support
 jo vyavastha swayan shoshan evam asaamanta ke upar tiki ho, vah shoshan-mukt or samanta par aadhaarit saamaajikta kii vaahak nahin ho sakati
 uskaa vishwaas tha ki manushya apane paryaavaran se prabhavit hota he, atah paryaavaran ke badlaav ke saath uske vyaktitv main badlaav bhi sambhav he
 However, contradictions are also seen in his thoughts
 puunji-perrit varchasvvaad kii aalochana karte hue francisi vidwaan furior ne kaha tha ki- The remarks made by Owen in 1816, undergoing a recession, symbolize his capitalist attitude
 usne kaha tha ki- 'our best customer war, is over now
 ’ Owen hated the then factory system
 uskaa maananaa tha ki is utpaadan vyavastha ne saamaajik gairjimmedaari, vidhvansak spardhaa evam hridayaviheen vyaktvaad ko janm diya he
 He was of the view that one of the causes of social tension is the unwanted, uncontrolled competition of human labor and machines
 iskaa hal yahi he ki manushya sangathit hokar mashiinon kaa sahyog lete hue utpaadan kaary kare
 Therefore, he took several steps to improve the standard of living of his workers
 yahi nahin ucch gunvattta ke mahatva ko sweekaarte hue usne un karmchaariyon ko vishesh laabh evam protsaahan dene kaa kaam prarambh kiya jo behatar gunvattta kaa maal banane main nipun the
 In his factory, cubes of different colors were kept equal to each machine
 ghan ke rang se ban rahe maal kii gunvattta kii koti nirdhaarit kii jaati thi
 With this, the artisan knew the level of his work
 usee ke aadhaar par protsaahan raashi kaa bhugtan kiya jaataa tha
 It is clear that Owen's factories at that time had a standard of work and conditions better than other factories
 new lenork par oven kaa prabhaav ghatata ja rahaa tha
 His partners had also left
 kintu naitikta or sahjivan ke prati oven kaa vishwaas kam nahin hua tha
 His eyes were now on the countries outside Europe
 isi bich oven kii khyaati america pahunchi or vahaan new haarmani jane ke liye oven ko america kaa nimantran mila
 Owen decides to leave New Lanark
 is faisle ke peeche englandvasiyon kii nae prayogon ke prati udaseenta bhi thi
 In this way, proposals were also received from the provinces of Scotland, Ireland etc
 for settling settlements based on symbiosis
 magar oven ko vahaan kii paristhitiyon main koi antar najar nahin aayaa
 In 1824, Owen crossed the Atlantic Ocean and reached Harmon, where he was strongly welcomed
 1825 main new lenark ke prayogon ko aage badhaane ke liye usne tees hajaar pound main new haarmani, indiana naamak sthaan par kai acre jameen kharidi
 Where he established a new colony with the aim of furthering the experiments of New Lenark
 kuch hi maheenon main new haaramani kii khyaati duniya-bhar main fail gai
 Encouraged by the success there, Owen laid the foundation of another colony at a place called Oribiston (vatipejavadh)
 praarambhik safaltaaon se utsahit hokar oven ne kuch anya sthanon par bhi bastiyaan basaayi
 unke naam hai queen wood ;fanmamad vavakaddhae relatin ;tansanjapadmaddh aadi
 All those settlements were settled on the basis of the principle of symbiosis
 pehle kii bhaanti in bastiyon ke madhyam se bhi, oven kaa sapana shoshan evam varg-mukt samaaj kii sthapana karnaa tha
 He envisioned a society where all lived based on reciprocity
 ek basti main 300 se 2000 tak sadsy hon, jinke paas ek hajaar acre se lekar 1500 acre tak krishi-yogya jameen ho
 Excluding the accommodation of the members of the colony, the kitchen, restaurant, assembly building, school, library, flour mill, factory etc
 should be group hall and for them a huge square shaped building
 oven kaa sochna tha ki is prakaar kii vyavastha se jivan main dhan kii mahatta ghategiμjo manushya main sangrah kii aadat ke panpane kaa pramukh kaaran he
 From 1825 to 1829, New Harmony was the first and famous of the sixteen settlements settled on the basis of Owen's theory
 lekin kshetreey paristhitiyon ke kaaran bastiyon ko chalaane main samasyaayein aane lageen
 In fact, in a small province like New Harmony, people of different classes lived together
 un sabaki alag samasyaayein thim
 Therefore, the use of new hormones could not be prolonged
 america main oven ke prayogon ko pehali thes us samay mili jab uskaa ek america saajhedaar apni puunji sahit oven se alag ho gaya
 It is noteworthy that Owen had a lot of capital involved in all these works; Due to which his business was badly affected
 uski kul puunji kaa teen-chathai hissaa new haaramani naamak basti kii basaane main pehle hi kharch ho chukaa tha
 Owen believed that the success of a system based on symbiosis was possible only in the generality of his efforts
 kisi bhi vyakti kii simaaen hai atah aise prayaason kii safalataa ke liye samaaj ke duusare logon ko bhi aage aana hoga
 Government is also the most responsible
 yahi sochate hue usne sarkaar se bhi madad maangi thi
 The matter was also laid on the floor of the Parliament
 magar avyaavhaarik maanate hue us prastaav ko asweekrut kar diya gaya
 The specialty of the settlements settled by Owen was that his life was based on collective and cooperation
 puri basti ek brihad parivaar ke samaan thi; jiske sadasyon ke sukh or dukh saajhe the
 There was a level of ambition
 yahaan tak ki unke sapanom or sankalpon par bhi samuhikta kaa prabhaav tha
 Owen had a clear belief that in ideal-oriented society, social relations should be the basis of service rather than profit
 vahaan ke kaary vyapaar main paardarshita evam samasahbhaagita ho, tabhi shoshan se mukti sambhav he
 Owen wanted to establish those settlements as ideals of symbiosis
 oven samarthak samaajwaadiyon ke samooh gaan main sahjivan ke aadarshon kii jhalak sahaj hi dekhi ja sakati he
 This song was sung very enthusiastically in the settlements established by Owen - 'brothers! See the day drenched with matchless love and revered with supreme truth
 uthakar dekho, manushyata pratispardhaa ke sthaan par saamudayik jivan kaa anand or aashirwad lene ke liye utsuk he
 Now justice will prevail
 taqatvar ke daman kaa ant hoga, saarvatrik anand kii anand hoga
 '1 bees varsh tak lagaataar vah samuhik jivan kii safalataa ke liye kaam karata rahaa
 But gradually the failure began to appear, because the majority of people who came to settle in these settlements were those who were not interested in Owen's principles
 unase bahut to apradhi manovriti ke the or surakshit thikaane kii khoj unhen un bastiyon tak le gai thi
 The settlements established by Owen were very favorable for the Nakara and Doodhorn people to hide their heads
 duusari samasya vahaan par samarpit kaaryakartaaon kii thi
 The kind of volunteers who were needed for the efficient operation of those settlements, there was a lack of them
 haalanki bastiyon main aane vaale kuch log sachmuch hi oven ke vichaaron ko samarpit hokar vahaan pahanche the
 But most of the amateurs used to go there only to spend time
 new hormani ke kuch sadsy loktantric parampara se nikalakar aae the or vyavastha main khulaapan laana chaahate the
 He did not accept Owen's monopoly
 dhyatavya he ki un bastiyon main oven kii sthiti parivaar ke mukhyi jaisi thi
 As a result, settlements started by Owen causing problems
 jon karl ke shabdon main- The township was formed with the rashness of its members
 iske kaaran ek tarah se ve apane patan kii ghoshnaa kar hi chuke the
 Perhaps it was unfortunate to meet them
 vastav main sahakaarita ke adhar par gathit vah samooh uski bhaavana se koson dur tha
 The biggest misfortune of that group of more than nine hundred people was that they did not even know each other since the beginning of symbiosis
 unamem jagah-jagah se, vibhinn peshon, parivesh se aae tarah-tarah ke log sammilit the, jinamein kaamkaaji parivaar, madhyavargi buddhijivi tathaa swayan ko pragatisheel kehane vaale ghummakad kism ke buddhijivi aadi sammilit the
 The formation of mass settlements was a victim of overwhelming inexperience
 jiskaa parinaam unamem ladaai-jhagade or kalahabaaji ke rup main dekhne ko mila
 vibhinn prishthbhumiyon, jatiyon se sambhddha logon ne aapas main lard-jhagadkar apane liye dusaraan ke man main vaimnasy kii bhaavana bhar di thi, jiskaa nidaan asambhav tha
 Their mutual estrangement had increased so much that at the end when the use of mass settlements was declared unsuccessful and people started returning, their mutual quarrels continued for a long time
 Eventually by dividing the land, the residents of New Harmony got divided into many cooperative settlements, families
 ’ Owen tried again in Mexico after the use of the new hormone was unsuccessful
 vahaan garibi anupaat adhik hone ke kaaran usko safalataa kii aas adhik thi
 But contrary to hope, he encountered a traditionalist church in Mexico, which had a great influence on the poor people there
 parinaam ye hua ki oven america se oobal laga
 In 1828, he left for England
