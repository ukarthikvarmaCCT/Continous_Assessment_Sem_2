 The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has further divided NREM into three levels: N1, N2 and N3
 The last level is also known as delta sleep or slow-wave sleep
 REM or NREM ke chakra main neend agrasar hoti jaati he, kram saamaanya rup se N1 → N2 → N3 → N2 → REM hota he
 Much deeper sleep occurs early in the night, while the ratio of REM sleep increases later in the night and just before natural awakening
 1937 main sabase pehle alfred lee loomis or unke sahakarmiyon ne neend ke charnon kaa varnan kiya tha; jinhone neend kii vibhinn electroencephalography visheshtaon ko paanch staron main vibhajit kiya tha, jo jaagrathavastha se gahari neend ke kram kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 In 1953, a different form of REM sleep was discovered and thus William Dement and Nathaniel Kleitman reclassified sleep into NREM stages and REM
 1968 main "aar and ke sleep scoring manual" main alaan rechtcamphen or anthoni kales ne charnon ke maandand ko manakikrut kiya
 In the R&K standard, NREM sleep was divided into four stages, with slow-wave sleep stages being stages 3 and 4
 charan 3 main, delta tarangen kul tarang pattern kaa 50% se kam hoti hai, jabaki charan 4 main ye 50% se adhik ho jaaya karti hai
 In addition, REM sleep was sometimes referred to as stage 5
 2004 main, AASM ne aar and ke scoring pranali kii samiksha ke liye AASM drishy scoring task force ko niyukt kiya
 Several changes were made from the review, the most important being the combination of Phase 3 and Phase 4 into Phase N3
 The revised scoring was published in 2007 as The AASM Manual for Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events

 Sleep stages and other characteristics of sleep are commonly evaluated by polysomnography in a specialized sleep laboratory
 liye gayi maap main mastishk kii tarangon kaa EEG, netra gati kaa electroculography or kankaleey mansapeshi kii gatividhi kaa electromiography shaamil hai
 In humans, each sleep cycle lasts from 90 to 110 minutes on average, and each stage may have different physiological functions
 isse neend to aa sakati he or behoshee jaisi haalat lag sakati he, lekin isse shaareerik kaary puure nahin hote 
 According to the 2007 AASM Standards, NREM consists of three phases
 enariem main apekshaakrit kam sapane aayaa karte hai
 Phase N1 is related to the transition of the brain, in this phase the brain transitions from alpha waves of frequencies 8 to 13 Hz to theta waves of 4 to 7 Hz frequencies
 is charan ko kai baar uneendaapan yaa oonghti neend kaha jaataa he
 Sudden jerking and sleep emergence are also known as positive myoclonus, which may be associated with the onset of sleep during N1
 kuch logon ko is charan ke dauraan nidrajanak matibhram bhi ho saktaa he, jo unke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 During N1, the person loses some muscle condition and most conscious awareness of the external environment
 charan N2 kii visheshta he ki is dauraan neend kii takali 11 se 16 hertz or ke-samashtiyon ke bich gumti rahati he
 During this phase, as measured by EMG, muscle activity decreases and conscious awareness of the external environment disappears
 vayaskon main yah charan kul neend ke 45% se 55% main hua karata he
 The characterization of stage N3 is performed in such a way that at least 20% of the delta waves are between 0
5 and 2 Hz and the peak-to-peak amplitude is> 75 μv
 isi charan main raatri aatank, raatri shayyamutra, neend main chalanaa or neend main badbadana jaise parasomanian hua karte hai
 Many illustrations and descriptions still depict N3 phase with 20% –50% delta waves and N4 with more than 50% delta waves; These are jointly stage N3
 tej netra gati neend, yaa aariem neend, adhikansh maanav vayaskon kii kul neend kaa 20%–25% hua karti he
 Criteria for REM sleep include rapid eye movements and a rapid low-voltage EEG

 dinchar pashuon main, hormone melatonin ke nirgaman ke kaaran sirkadian tatv se or sharir ke bhitari taapmaana main kramik kami se tandra yaa uneendaapan aayaa karata he
 Time is affected by one's chronotype

 The spontaneity of homeostatic sleep needs to be balanced with the circadian element for satisfactory sleep
 sirkadian ghadi se praapt sandesh ke saath-saath yah sharir ko bataata he ki ise neend kii jarurat he
 The circadian rotation mainly determines wakefulness from sleep
 ek vyakti jo niyamit rup se jaldi uthta yaa uthati he, aam taur par vah apane saamaanya samay se adhik der tak soye nahin rah saktaa yaa sakati, yahaan tak ki bhale hi usne kam neend lee ho
 Sleep duration is influenced by the DEC2 gene
 kuch logon main is jin kaa utparivartan hota he; ve saamaanya se do ghante kam sote hai
 Professor of neurological science ying-hui Fu and colleagues breed mice carrying the DEC2 mutation, which would have slept less than normal mice

 The correct timing is when the following two markers or markers appear after the middle episode of sleep and before waking up: maanav neend umr ke hisaab se or vyaktiyon ke bich bhinn ho sakati he or agar din main uneendaapan yaa dushkriya na ho to neend ko paryaapt mana jaataa he

 Other studies show that "increased mortality is consistently associated with those sleeping more than 7 to 8 hours per day", although this study also states that it may be due to depression and socio-economic conditions, Which become co-related in terms of data
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki alarm lagaakar jagane waalon kii tulana main, jo log prakritik rup se kam neend ke baad jag jaaya karte hai, sirf uname kam neend ke ghante or kam rugnataa ke bich sah-sambandh prakat hote hai
 Researchers at the University of Warwick and University College London found that sleep deprivation more than doubled the risk of death from heart disease, but too much sleep may also be associated with doubling the risk of death, although primarily Not from heart disease
 professor francisco capusio ne kaha, "choti neend ko vajan badhane, ucchraktchaap or tip 2 madhumeh ke liye or kabhi-kabhi mrityu ke liye ek jokhim kaa kaarak banataa dekha gaya he; lekin choti neend-mrityu dar ke vipareet lambii neend ko badhi hui mrityu dar se jod sakane ke liye koi sambhavit tantra saamne nahin aayaa he, abhi isaki jaanch hona baaqi he
 Some people are involved, but depression, low socioeconomic status, and cancer-related illness are the reasons for this 


 In terms of prevention, our findings suggest that sleeping around seven hours per night continuously is optimal for health Or is best and a continued decrease in sleep may predispose to ill health
 " In addition, sleep difficulties are intimately associated with psychiatric disorders such as depression, alcoholism, and bipolar disorder

 neend ke prakaarya ke bare main anek siddhanton ne apni-apni vyakhya prastaavit kii he, lekin aisa pratibimbit hota he ki vishay ke bare main samajhadaari philhal adhuri he
 It is possible that sleep evolved to fulfill some fundamental function, and over time it took many functions

 It has been found that sleep damage affects the immune system
 2007 main jager at al
 dwaara kiye gayi ek adhyayan main, chuhon ko 24 ghante tak neend se vanchit rakhaa gaya
 a blood test of sleep deprived mice found a 20% decrease in white blood cell count when compared with a controlled group, a significant change in the immune system
 ab yah kaha janaa sambhav he ki "neend kii kshati rogksham kaary ko ksheen karti he or rogksham neend main herpher kii chunauti pesh karata he," or yah bataaya gaya ki standhari praani jo ki lambii neend main apana samay lagaaya karte hai ve rogksham pranali main nivesh karte hai, kyonki jin prajatiyon kii lambii neend hua karti he unamem adhik shwet rakt kan hua karte hai
 It is yet to be proven that sleep duration affects somatic development
 2007 main jeni at al

 yah paaya gaya ki "bacchon main neend kii avadhi main badlaav kaa asar unke vikaas par hota nahin lagata he
 "it has been observed that sleep — and more specifically slow sleep — affects the increase of hormone levels in adult males

 There are many arguments in favor of the healthy work of sleep
 neend ke dauraan chayapachay charan sarjan kriya he; neend ke dauraan sanvruddhi hormone jaise sarjan kriya hormone jaise adhimaanya dhang se sravit hote hai
 In general, sleep duration in species is inversely related to animal size and directly related to basal metabolic rate
 ek bahut hi ucch aadhariya chayapachay dar ke saath chuuhe rojaanaa 14 ghante tak kii neend liya karte hai, jabaki hathi or jiraph nimna aadhariya chayapachay dar ke saath maatr 3-4 ghante hi sote hai
 Energy conservation can be done by resting peacefully without shutting down the composition of the atmosphere, which is a potentially dangerous situation
 ek mand nahin sone vaala jaanavar kii shikariyon se bache rahane kii adhik sambhaavna he, jabaki tab bhi vah urja sangrakshan karata rahata he
 Sleep, sleep, seems to serve a purpose or purposes other than conserving energy; For example, hibernating animals go to sleep again after waking up from hibernation due to lack of sleep during the hibernation period
 ve nishchit rup se acchhee tarah se aaraam kar chuke hote hai or sheetanidra ke dauraan urja sangrakshan bhi kiya he, lekin kuch anya kaaran se unhen sone kii jarurat he
 Rats that are kept awake indefinitely develop skin lesions, hyperphagia, loss of body mass, hypothermia and, eventually, fatal septicemia
 REM neend kii ontogenetic pariklpana ke anusaar, navjaat shishu sambandhi REM neend ke dauraan hone vaali gatividhi khaskar sharir ke vikaas ke liye mahatvapurn he 
 Studies on the effects of active sleep deprivation have shown that early in life this deficiency causes behavior problems, permanent sleep disruption, decreased brain mass, and death of neuron cells in an unusual magnitude
 mastishk ke vikaas ke liye REM neend mahatvapurn prathit hota he
 Most of the sleep of infants is occupied by REM sleep, babies spend most of their time in sleep
 vibhinn prajatiyon main, janm lenevaala shishu jitna adhik aparipakv hota he, vah utana hi adhik samay REM neend main bitaata he
 The proponents also state that rem-induced muscle inhibition in the presence of brain activation aids brain development by activating the chetopagam, although this may put the infant in trouble without any operational consequences
 iske atirikt, REM neend ke abhaav se baad ke jivan main vikaas kii asaamanyataayen paidaa hoti hai
 However, this has not been explained why adult adults still need REM sleep
 jaleey stanpayi shishu shaishvavastha main REM neend nahin lete; umr badhane ke saath aise pashuon main REM neend badhati jaati he
 Scientists have described many ways in which sleep has been shown to be related to memory
 turnar, drumund, salaamat or brown dwaara kiye gayi ek adhyayan main neend ke abhaav se karyrat smriti par prabhaav padataa dikhaaya gaya
 Working memory is important because it keeps information active for further processing and supports higher-level cognitive functions such as decision making, reasoning, and contextual memory
 adhyayan main 18 mahilaon or 22 purushon ko chaar dinon kii avadhi main prati raat sirf 26 minute hi sone kii anumati di gayi
 These individuals initially gave cognitive tests after complete rest and then were tested twice a day during four days of sleep deprivation
 antim pareekshan main, niyantrit samooh kii tulana main is neend-abhavagrast samooh kii ausat karyrat smriti vistaar main 38% kii giravat paayi gayi
 Memory seems to be affected differently by certain stages of sleep such as REM and slow sleep
 born, rasch or ges main uddhrut, ek adhyayan main anek maanav vishyon kaa upyog kiya gaya tha: jaagran niyantrit samoohon or neend pareekshan samoohon kaa
 neend or jaagran samoohon ko ek kaary sikhaaya gaya or phir sabhi pratibhaagiyon main santulit rup se raat ke kram main, raat kii shuruyaat or der raat donon hi samay pareekshan kiya gaya
 When those participants' brains were scanned during sleep, the hypnogram found that SWS dominated the sleep phase early in the night, representing an average of around 23% of sleep phase activity
 niyantrit samooh kii tulana main, ghoshnaatmak smriti pareekshan main aarambhik-raatri pareekshan samooh ne 16% behatar pradarshan kiya
 During late-night sleep, REM became the most active sleep stage, with approximately 24% and the late-night test group performed 25% better on the procedural memory test than the control group
 isse pataa chalata he ki der-raatri rem-sampann neend se prakriyaatmak smriti ko laabh miltaa he, jabaki aarambhik-raatri sws-sampann neend se ghoshnaatmak smriti ko laabh hota he
 a study conducted by Dutta has indirectly supported these results
 22 nar chuhon ko adhyayan kaa paatr banaaya gaya tha
 a box was constructed in which a rat could move freely from one end to the other
 dibbe kii tali ispaat kii jaali se banaayi gayi thi
 a light flashes in the compartment with a sound
 Five seconds later, an electric shock is applied
 As soon as the blow started, the rat would go to the other end of the box, then the blow would have ended immediately
 Rats could also go to the other end of the box using a five-second delay and thus avoid shocks altogether
 jatke kii avadhi kabhi bhi paanch second se adhik nahin rahi
 This was repeated 30 times on half the mice
 anya aadhe, niyantran samooh, ko usee pareekshan main rakhaa gaya, lekin unki pratikriya par dhyaan die bina chuhon ko jhatka diya gaya
 After each training session, the mice were kept in a recording cage for six hours for polygraphic recording
 This process was repeated for three consecutive days
 is adhyayan main paaya gaya pareekshan ke baad neend ki neend recording satr ke dauraan, chuhon ne niyantran pareekshanon ke baad kii tulana main, abhyaas pareekshanon ke baad REM neend main 25
47% adhik samay bitaayaa
 ye pareekshan born at al
 adhyayan ke parinaamon kaa samarthan karte hai, inase REM neend or prakriyaatmak gyaan ke bich sahasambandh kaa ek spasht sanket miltaa he
 An observation from the Dutta study is that the sleep exercise group spent 180% more time in the SWS than the control group during the recording session after the test
 This fact was supported by a study by Kudrimoti, Burns and mcnaughton
 is adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki sthanik khoj gatividhi ke baad, prayog main hippocample kii koshikaon kaa pattern SWS ke dauraan punahsakriy hota he
 Kudrimoti et al
 In one study, seven mice were run in a linear track using the reward at one end
 chuhon ko trek main anukool hone ke liye 30 minute tak rahane diya gaya, phir unhen inaam-aadhaarit prashikshan ke liye trek main 30 minute tak daudaya gaya or phir unhen 30 minute tak aaraam karne diya gaya
 During each of these three periods, EEG data were collected to inform the rats' sleep stages
 kudrimoti at al
 ne SWS ke purv-vyavhaar ke dauraan hippocample kii koshikaon kii min firing rates ko or saat chuhon ke ausatan 22 trek -daud dwaara SWS ke uttar-vyavhaar main teen baar rakhe das minute ke avkaash ko pariklit kiya
 The results showed that the ten minutes after the test race session showed a 12% increase in mean firing rate of hippocampal cells compared to prior levels; However, after 20 minutes, the mean firing rate rapidly returned to the previous level
 sthanik anveshan ke baad SWS ke dauraan hippocample kii koshikaon kii firing main vruddhi se samajha ja saktaa he ki aakhir kyon datta ke adhyayan main SWS neend kaa str bad gaya tha, kyonki yah bhi sthanik anveshan ke ek rup se sambhddha tha
 In order to increase the magnitude of slow oscillations during SWS, a study was conducted involving direct current stimulation in the puerperal cortex
 ekadish dhara uttejan ne agle din shabd-jodi samaran main bahut vruddhi kar di, isse yah pramaan mila ki praasangik smritiyon ke samekan main SWS ek badi bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Various studies suggest that there is a correlation between complex functions of sleep and memory
 harvard ke neend shodhakarta sapar or stickgold kaa kahana he ki smriti or abhyaas kaa ek aavashyak hissaa tantrika koshika drumashm se yukt hota he, jo nae neuronal samparkon main sangathit hone ke liye koshika pind ko soochna bhejtaa he
 This process demands that no external information be presented to these drachms and it is also said that this is probably why memories and knowledge are solid and organized during sleep
 "parirakshan or sangrakshan" ke siddhant kaa maananaa he ki neend anukoolneey kaary karti he
 In those parts of the 24 hours of the day when the creature is protected, when it is awake and therefore moving around and when the person is at great risk
 jeev ko bhojan karne ke liye 24 ghante kii jarurat nahin hoti or vah anya jaruraton ko puraa karata he
 With this approach of adaptation, organisms stay out of harm's way, where they can fall prey to other potentially strong organisms
 ve usee samay neend lete hai jo unki suraksha ko adhiktam banaata he, unhen shaareerik kshamta or unka awaas pradaan karata he
 
 haalanki, yah siddhant isaki vyakhya karne main vifal rahaa kii aakhir kyon saamaanya neend ke dauraan bahari vaataavaran se mastishk kaa sambandh tut jaataa he
 Another argument against this theory is that sleep is not merely a passive consequence of separating animals from the environment, but rather a "drive"; the animal is late in its behavior in order to sleep
 isliye, gatividhi or niskriyata kii avadhi kii vyakhya ke liye sirkadian viniman paryaapt se adhik he, jo jeev ke liye anukoolneey he, lekin neend kii or bhi adhik ajeeb vishistataaen sambhawatah anya tathaa agyaat kaaryon ko puraa karti hai
 In addition, preservation theory needs to explain why carnivores such as lions, who are at the top of the food chain and who do not have much fear, tend to sleep too much
 yah kaha gaya he ki ve jab shikaar par nahin hote tab unhen urja ksharan ko kam karne kii jarurat hoti he
 Preservation theory also does not explain why aquatic mammals sleep while walking
 in samvedansheel ghanton ke dauraan niskriyata vahi karti he or adhik laabhprad ban jaati he, kyonki praani tab bhi shikariyon aadi kii tarah kii paryaavaran chunautiyon kaa saamana karne main sakasham hota he
 Sleep faults again after faulty adaptation to the sleepless night, but apparently for some reason
 apane sone ke samay kisi singh se apni jaan bachaane main laga hua ek zebra din ke samay neend se nidhaal hokar so jaataa he, jo shikaar banane se kam nahin, kahin adhik asurakshit he
 Dreaming is the feeling of sensory images and sounds during sleep, the dreamers in sequence feel more like a manifest partner than an observer
 sapane dekhnaa pons dwaara utprerit hota he or neend ke REM charan ke dauraan adhikanshtah sapane aayaa karte hai
 People have introduced many concepts about dream work
 sigmund frid ne nirvivaad rup se maan liya ki sapane un apurna ichchhaaon kii abhivyakti hai jo achetan man main daal yaa phenk di jaati hai or unhone in ichchhaaon kii khoj ke liye manovishleshan ke rup main sapanom kii vyakhya kaa upyog kiya
 See Freud: The Interpretation of Dreams frid kaa kaam sapanom kii manovaigyanik bhoomika se sambandhit he, jo spasht rup se kisi bhi shaareerik bhoomika ke ho sakane ko chhod nahin detaa
 isliye haal ke smriti or anubhav ke vyavasthaapan or samekan main badhati aadhunik dilchaspee dwaara isse inkaar nahin kiya gaya he
 Recent research claims that the overall role of consolidation and administration of Chetopagam contacts during exercise and experience is that of sleep
 jon alan hobsan or robert mccarle kaa sakriyan sanshleshan siddhantakahata he ki REM avadhi main dimagi valkal main hone vaali neuron kii andhadhundh firing se sapane aayaa karte hai
 According to this theory, the forebrain then weaves a story in an attempt to reconcile and draw meaning by presenting nonsensical sensory information; That's why many dreams are of strange nature
 prabhavi khuraaq kuch had tak purv main upyog par nirbhar karata he
 As its effects begin to wane, it may cause a rapid alertness

 As taught by Lahiri Mahasya, Kriya Yoga is traditionally learned only through the Guru-disciple tradition
 unhone samaran kiya ki, kriya yoga main unki diksha ke baad, "babaaji ne mujhe un pracheen kathor niyamon main nirdeshit kiya jo guru se shishy ko sanchaarit yoga kala ko niyantrit karte hai

 a minute and a half of energy around a human's sensitive spinal cord can make rapid progress in its development; For example, a half-minute Kriya Yoga equals one year of natural spiritual development
 " Swami Sathyananda's Kriya quote states, "kriya cultivation can be considered as if it is the practice of" the way of living in the soul "
 yoganand ji ke anusaar, pracheen bharat main kriya yoga bhalee bhaanti janaa jaataa tha, lekin ant main yah kho gaya, jiskaa kaaran tha purohit gopneeyata or manushya kii udaseenta
 Yogananda says that Lord Krishna has referred to Kriya Yoga in the Bhagavad-gītā: bahyagami shwaason main antargami shwashon ko samarpit kar or antargami shwaason main bahyagami shwaason ko samarpit kar, ek yogi in donon shwaason ko tatast karata he; aisa karke vah apni jivan shakti ko apane hryday se nikaal kar apane niyantran main le letaa he
 Yogananda also said that Lord Krishna mentions Kriya Yoga when "lord Krishna states that he, in his former incarnation, conveyed the information of imperishable yoga to an ancient enlightened, Vaivasvata who communicated it to the great administrator Manu
 iske baad unhone, yah gyaan bharat ke surya vanshi samrajya ke janak ikshvaku ko pradaan kiya

 "sri Shailendra Bijoy Dasgupta, a disciple of Sri Yukteswar Giri, wrote that," There are many methods associated with Kriya which are authentically derived from the concept of Gita, Yoga Sutras, Tantra Shastra and Yoga
 " The story of getting initiation of Kriya Yoga in 1861 from Mahavatar Babaji of Lahiri Mahasya is described in the autobiography of a yogi
 yoganand ne likhaa he ki us baithak main, mahavatar babaaji ne lahiri mahashay se kaha ki, "yah kriya yoga jise main is unnisvin sadi main tumhaare jariye is duniya ko de rahaa hum, yah usee vigyaan kaa punah pravartan he jo bhagwaan krishna ne sadiyon pehle arjuna ko diya; or baad main yah patanjali or isa messiah, saint jon, saint paul or anya shishyon ko gyaat hua
 "yoganand ji also wrote that Babaji and Jesus lived in a constant communion with each other and the two together," planned a spiritual technique of liberation for this age
 " Through Lahiri Monsieur, Kriya Yoga soon spread across India

 nakshatra samay samaymaapan kii ek vidhi he jiskaa upyog khagolvigyaani kisi nakshatra vishesh ko raatri main apane doordarshee kii sahaayta se dekhne ke liye karte hai
 With this, they know at what time in the direction of the visionary the constellation will appear
 prekshan ke kisi ek sthaan se akaash main jis sthaan par koi tara dikhaai pasta he, agali raat usee nakshatra-samay par lagbhag usee disha main milegaa
 Just as the Sun and Moon are seen rising in the East and setting in the West, similarly other constellations also appear
 'saura samay' or 'nakshatra samay' dono hi prithvi kii apni dhruviya aksh par ghurnan gati kii niyamitata par aadhaarit hai
 The knowledge of time is taken from the visible positions of the Sun
 saamanyat: suryoday se suryaast tak din tathaa suryaast se pun: suryoday tak raatri hoti hai, kintu tithigananaa ke liye din raat milakar din kehalaate hai
 a revision of the midpoint of the post-meridian circle by the Sun at a place is called a 'visible day', and a revision relative to a stationary constellation of the Sun is called a 'sidereal day'
 yah nakshatra roodhi ke anusaar maap kaa aadi bindu, arthath krantivrutt tathaa vishuvat vrutt kaa vasant sampaat bindu liya jaataa he
 Although the sidereal day is stationary, it is not useful for our behavior, because this view is 3 minutes 53 seconds less than the day
 drishy din kaa maan sadaa ek sa nahin rahata
 Therefore, it is difficult to tell the time of the sun from a watch
 iske do kaaran hai : ek to surya kii spasht gati sadaa ek si nahin rahati, duusare spasht surya krantivrutt main chalata dikhaai detaa he
 We need such a sun to make a timetable device, which always moves in equinoctial at a moderate speed
 aise surya ko jyotishi log jyotish-madhya-surya athwa keval madhya surya kehete hai
 Bhaskaracharya has called the difference between the equator and the middle sun of the ecliptic, the difference between the Udayantra and the ecliptic, the middle sun and the apparent sun
 yadi jyotish-madhya surya main udayantar tathaa bhujaantar sanskaar kar den, to vah drishy surya ho jayega
 In modern terminology, simultaneous rites of Udayantar and Bhujantar are called time equations
 yah hamaari ghadiyon ke samay tathaa drishy surya ke samay ke antar ke tulya hota he
 Time reviewer can be calculated only per day by mathematics
 aajkal prakashit honevaale navik panchang main, iskaa pratidin kaa maan diya rahata he
 Thus we can find the time of visible sun whenever we want with our watches
 iskaa jyotish main bahut upyog hota he
 Inversely: We can fix the time of our clocks by observing the skipping of the post-meteorological point of the Sun, adding or subtracting the time criterion in it, and finding the actual mean-sun time
 ham hamane samay naapane ke liye aadhunik ghadiyaan bataayin, tab yah paaya gaya ki sardi tathaa garmi ke kaaran ghadiyon ke dhaatunirmit purjon ke sikudne tathaa failane ke kaaran ye ghadiyaan thik samay nahin deteen
 Now we had this problem, how do we know the subtle impurities of our mechanical watches? Although we could know the inaccuracy of our clocks by the method of skipping the Sun's vertical meridian, the perforation of the sun's post-meteor skipping itself is somewhat unique and there is a greater possibility of the observer's personal error due to the larger image of the Sun
 duusari kathinaayee yah thi ki hamaari madhya-surya-ghadi ke samay kaa akashiya pindon kii sthiti se koi pratyaksh sambandh na tha
 The constellation clock was created to fill this gap, which indicated the constellation time
 iske 24 ghante prithvi kii apane aksh kii ek parikrama ke, athwa vasantapaat bindu ke urdhv yamyottar bindu kii ek parikrama ke, samay ke tulya hote hai
 Around 21 March, the spring point skips vertically with our visible sun
 us samay nakshatra ghadi kaa samay shunya ghanta, shunya minutes, shunya second hota he
 It is 12 in our time
 duusare din dopaher ko nakshatra ghadi kaa samay 4 minute hoga
 On any other fixed day, we can change the mean-sun time in proportion to the nakshatra even, or the nakshatra time to mean sun time
 navik panchangon main is prakaar ke samayparivartan kii saraniyan di rahati hai
 Thus, if we find a sidereal clock giving pure time, then we can keep the time of our mean clock pure
 yadhyapi nakshatra ghadi bhi yantric hoti he tathaa usamen bhi yantric truti ho jaati he, tathaapi ise pratidin shuddh kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki iskaa akashiya pindon kii sthiti se pratyaksh sambandh he
 It goes like this: The angle that a planet and star makes from the posterior meridian point towards Pachim on the celestial pole is called a kalakone
 is prakaar nakshatra sam basantpaat kaa kalkon he
 The equinox of a star or planet is determined by its equinoctial distance from spring to the sun or stars, with the help of an instrument called chronometer, the constellation of their post-mortem time is known
 nakshatra ghadi se milakar, yamyottar yantra ke doordarshee main grah yaa taare ke bedh ke nakshatra samay ko kronometer kaa switch dabaakar jaan liya jaataa he
 From this time, the time that is obtained when mechanical impurities are removed is the time of skipping the vertical point of the meridian of the planet or star
 yadi nakshatra padi thik he, to yah grah yaa taare ke vishuvaansh ke tulya hoga or antar ghadi kii ashuddhi he
 In this way, the mean Sun clocks are purified by keeping the constellation clock pure
 yamyottar yantra dwaara vedh karne main vyaktigat ashuddhi kii adhik sambhaavna he
 Therefore, the constellation time of the post-skipping time of stars is also known from the camera with fixed telescopes
 is prakaar yadhyapi madhya samay kii ghadiyon ko thik rakhaa jaataa he, tathaapi unamem dainik sanshodhan karnaa ek samasya thi
 Therefore nowadays seconds of indicator devices are made from crystals of quartz
 quartz ke crystalon par ushnata kaa prabhaav bahut kam padataa he
 Hence these watches give very pure time
 inamen second ke hajaarwein bhaag tak kii ashuddhi jaani ja sakati he
 Also, this clock can be mixed by listening to the time indicators, pips, of the clocks placed at other stations of that kind, and the time indicator pips can also be sent
 is prakaar kii ek ghadi kaashi kii prastaavit, rajkeey sanskrit kaalaj vedhashala ke liye san 1953 main mangvaai gai thi, jo ab rajkeey vedhashala nainital main he
 By correcting the main clocks of the country with this type of clocks, all the mean solar clocks are kept properly by the "peep" at the time of radio
 aajkal prayek desh main madhyaraatri ke samay ko shunya maanakar, vahiin se din kaa prarambh maanate hai
 24 hours a day are divided into two 12 hours, from 12 noon to 12 hours in the morning, and from 12 noon to 12 noon in the afternoon
 hamaari ghadiyaan yaheen samay batalaati hai
 These 24 hours are called civil days
 din main 24 ghante, 1 ghante main 60 minutes tathaa ek minute main 60 second hote hai

 Since time immemorial the people of the Asura tribe have been known as iron workers
 inkaa mukhya pesha louh ayskon ke madhyam se loha galane kaa rahaa he
 Traditionally, the economic system of the Asura tribe was wholly dependent on iron smelting and transferred agriculture, while highlighting the method of iron melting, Gupta wrote that three types of iron ores were identified by the Asuras in the Netarhat plateau region
 pehla pilaa,, doosraa bichchhi, teesraa goa

 vaayu main dabaav hota he
 Generally we do not feel it
 yadi hamaare sharir ke kisi ang se vaayu nikaal lee jaae, tab vaayu ke dabaav kii anubhuti hamen saralata se ho jaati he
 The amount of air pressure at sea level is equal to 760 mm of mercury pressure
 jaise jaise ham vaayu main upar uthte hai, taise taise dabaav kam hota jaataa he
 Even the pressure on some mountain tops has been found to be up to 9 pounds per square inch
 vaayu ko dabaaya bhi ja saktaa he
 Pressing increases its pressure
 aisi dabi hui vaayu kaa sampidit vaayu kehete hai
 This action of pressing is called 'compressing'
 sampeden se vaayu kaa aaytan kam ho jaataa he or dabaav bad jaataa he
 Thus air pressure can be raised very high
 sampidit vaayu kaa upyog aaj bahut adhik kaamon main ho rahaa he
 It is said to be happening in over two hundred works
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki do sau se adhik kaamon main ho rahaa he
 And it is increasing day by day
 iske upyog me koi khatra nahin he
 It can be easily transported to every location by machines
 isaki kuch mashine badi saral hai or kuch jatil bhi hai
 Compressed air can be used in two ways: by compressed air in machines, such air can be placed directly in the works, or compressed air can be stored in cylinders and stored in different works as required
 is
 sampidit vaayu praapt karne kii mashiinon ko vaayu sampidak kehete hai
 The simplest device for compressing the air is the air pump to fill the air in the bicycle or motorcar tubes
 par vaayu pump se adhik dabaav vaali sampidit vaayu nahin praapt ho sakati
 Complex air compressors are built for high pressure
 pehle pahal inkaa upyog sampidit vaayu dwaara chaalit drillon se pahaado ko katkar surang banane main hua tha
 They were also used in the rear rail brakes
 saamaanya vayusampidak se prati varg inch 60 se 100 pound kii dabaavvaali vaayu praapt hoti he
 Compressors are also made from which thousands of pounds of pressurized air can be obtained
 sampidak main silinder ke andar ek piston hota he
 There are two valves at one end of the cylinder, one opening inward and the other facing outward
 silinder ke piston ko jab khinchakar upar ke chor par laayaa jaataa he, tab silinder ke andar kii vaayu kaa dabaav kam ho jaataa he or vayumandal se vaayu is valve dwaara khinch lee jaati he
 When the piston is lowered, the opening valve closes as the pressure increases, and the outside valve opens, allowing the air of the cylinder to drain into the "wind"
 is prakriya ko kai baar dohraane se vayukaksh kii vaayu kaa dabaav dhire dhire badhane lagata he
 Air of appropriate pressure can be used by removing the tap
 vaayu sampidkon ko teen shreniyon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he : The diaphragmatic compressors are more commonly used
 inkaa siddhant vaisaa hi he jaisaa upar varnit he
 The air is pumped into the tubes of bicycles and motor vehicles by air pumps
 vaayu sampidkon se praapt sampidit vaayu dwaara chaalit drillon se pahaado main chhed kar surang banaai ja sakati he
 By air compressors, ventilation is done in theaters, cinemas, large buildings and mines, from which unclean air is removed and replaced by pure air
 isi sahaayta se pisai bhi ho sakati he
 Coal, stone, sand, concrete, etc
 are broken and crushed by large hammers from compressed air
 vaayu sampidak se praapt sampidit vaayu se revet kiya ja saktaa he or loha tathaa ispaat chhile ja sakate hai
 With the help of compressed air, polish can be carried on large ships, aircraft, motorcars, etc
 and varnish can be mounted
 gharon kii safai, deevaaron kii safedi tathaa rangaai ore fernichar par varnish chadhaai, vayusampidkon se praapt sampidit vaayu kii sahaayta se kam kharch main ho jaati he
 The cleaning of many items and the sowing of houses are also done with its help
 rail ke brake sampidit vaayu ke bal se kaary karte hai
 With the help of compressed air, many goods, such as grains, coal, etc
, can be sent from one place to another
 sampidit vaayu kii upyogita kii suchi kaaphi lambii he
 The use of compressed air is an important feature of modern science

' Although no final decision has been made regarding the debate associated with these questions, scholars have generally described three grounds for measuring equality: equality of welfare, equality of resources and equality of capacity or capability
 kalyaan ke samtawaad kaa siddhant mukhya rup se upyogetavaadiyon ke vichaar se judaa he
 Here 'kalyan' is mainly understood in two ways
 pehle tareeke ko jeremi bentham jaise clasical upyogetavaadi chintakon ne aage badhaayaa
 According to him, the total amount of pleasure is his happiness in comparison to the pain or suffering experienced by a person
 is drushtikon ke anusaar kisi vyakti ke bare main yah jaanane ke liye ki vah apni zindagi main kitna sukhi he, hamen yah dekhnaa chahie ki vah kitna zyaada kush he
 The second method related to welfare appears in recent writings related to utilitarianism
 isamen kalyaan ko ichha yaa variyata-santushti se joda jaataa he
 People have less or more welfare, depending on how many wishes or preferences are satisfied
 isi buniyadi arth main uski zindagi behatar yaa badtar hoti he
 Every person should be able to set their preferences independently
 vastutah jo samaaj kalyaan ke samaan rup se vitaran main vishwaas karata he, vah is baat kii zyaada chintaa nahin karata he ki ek vyakti ko kitna sansaadhan miltaa he
 But it does worry about whether these resources provide as much satisfaction or happiness for each person as others
 is yojana kii mahatvapurn baat yah he ki isamen is baat par jor diya jaataa he ki bhale hi sansadhano ke vitaran main asamanta ho, lekin har vyakti kaa samaan rup se kalyaan hona chahie
 Welfare 'resource egalitarianism' emphasizes equality of resources unlike egalitarians
 jaan rolls, ronold dwarkin, erik rokovoski aadi ko sansaadhan samtawadi vichaarak mana jaataa he
 Dworkin believes that equality of resources means that 'when a distribution plan distributes or transfers resources treating people as equal, any further transfer of resources should make the share of people more equal
 ’ lekin isi jagah yah jigyaasa utpann hoti he ki kin paristhitiyon main sansadhano kii samanta hasil kii ja sakati he
 Dworkin describes a two-stage process in this context: the ambition-sensitive auction and insurance scheme
 dwarkin ne sansaadhan-samtawadi sankalpana main pehle vikalp kii uplabdhta ko aavashyak bataaya he
 For this, he gives an example of the distribution of resources among equally talented people on a deserted island
 agar sabhi vyaktiyon ko sau clemshelles dekar ek pratiyogi bazaar kii tarah nilaamee prakriya apanaayi jaae to sabhi vyakti vahaan uplabdh sansadhano par apni variyataon ke mutabik boli lagaayenge
 After the auction process is over, everyone will have the desired resources
 parantu yahan yah mahatvapurn he ki aisi sthiti kii kalpana karte vakt sabhi vyaktiyon ke paas ek jaisi prakritik sakshamtaayen maan lee gayi thim
 But this is not the real state of society
 masalan samaaj main vruddh, shaareerik rup se viklang aadi bhi rahete hai
 For such a situation, Dworkin offers an insurance plan in which some compensation is paid for dealing with this type of misfortune
 masalan unhen 100 ke sthaan par 125 clemshelles diye ja sakate hai
 However, Dworkin's views have also been criticized by saying that compensation cannot be awarded for all kinds of natural harm
 parantu phir bhi dwarkin ne apni vitaran yojana ko sakshmata-asanvedi ke saath mahattvakanksha-samvedi bhi banane kii koshish kii he
 John Rawls is also considered an important egalitarian thinker
 jon rolls ne apni pustak a thiyari of justise main nyaay ke do siddhant pratipaadit kiye hai
 His first theory is called the principle of equal liberty in which he argued that each should have the same right to the broadest freedom that can play with the same freedom of others
 unke duusare siddhant ke anusaar saamaajik or aarthik vishamtaayen is dhang se vyavasthit kii jaaen ki inase hinatam sthiti vaale logon ko adhiktam laabh ho or ye vishamtaayen un padon or sthitiyon ke saath judi hon jo avasar kii uchit samanta kii sharton par sabake liye sulabh ho 
 Rawls places his theory in a particular precedence
 arthath pehle siddhant ko duusare siddhant kii apeksha praathamikta di gayi he
 In the second theory, priority is given to
 vastutah yahan rolls ne duusare logon kii swatantraaa ke liye kisi vyakti kii swatantraaa main katautee nahin kii he
 But at the same time he has ensured that any kind of interference in the principle of equality can be done only when it is of maximum benefit to the people of inferior status
 vastutah yahan rolls kaa samtawaad swatantraaa or samanta main saamanjasy sthapit karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Another concept of egalitarianism is that of egalitarianism
 ise amartya sen ne prastut kiya he
 Accordingly, attention should be paid to equalizing the capacity of the people
 capability ek nishchit tarah ke kaary ko karne kii kshamta he
 For example, literacy is a capability and reading is a task
 ek sansaadhan- samtawadi is baat par jor de saktaa he ki jis kshetra main sakshartaa kii kami he, vahaan logon ko kitaaben or shaikshik seva jaise sansaadhan diye jane chahie
 Strength on the other hand - egalitarians will emphasize that more important than providing external resources to the people is that the capacity or ability of the people to read and write is encouraged
 in sabase alag maaikel wolzar ne jatil samanta kaa vichaar pesh kiya he
 Wolzer believes that equality should not focus on a single feature such as welfare, resources, or capability
 unke anusaar kisi bhi vitaran kaa nyaaypurna yaa anyaaypurna hona un vastuon ke saamaajik arth se judaa hota he jinka vitaran kiya ja rahaa he
 Also, there should not be uniform standard of distribution in all spheres of social life
 udhaaharan ke liye bazaar or raajnneetik satta ke daayre alag-alag han
 Hence they argue that the distribution of goods within one realm is its internal issue and ideally it should not affect any other realm
 samtawaad saamaajik vaigyanikon ke liye aaj bhi ek mahatvapurn vichaar bana hua he
 But the politics of globalization has played an important role in weakening the programs of redistribution and the welfare policies of the state
 iske atirikt haal main ek anya vishisht raajnneetik parighatna bhi ubharkar saamne aayi he
 It is a political phenomenon: the political struggle of groups based on identity
 iske kaaran maanakeey raajnneetik siddhant main naye sarokaar bhi ubharkar saamne aaye hai
 'what is equality?' The debate over 'equality among' has taken its place
 lekin samatawadi tezi se apane vyaktigat purvagrahon ko chhod rahe hai
 They are now also deeply considering the inequalities of the groups
