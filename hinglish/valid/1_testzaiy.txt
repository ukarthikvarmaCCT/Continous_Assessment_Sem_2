 AW Hanson - Auditing of such articles is called auditing so that they can be believed and the details given by them can also be believed
 uparokt paribhaashaon ke aadhaar par nishkarsh rup me- Auditing is the specific and discreet examination of the books of account of a business organization, which is done by a qualified and impartial person with the help of certifiers, forms, information and explanations received from the institution, so that the auditor remains for a fixed time
 In relation to the accounting, we can report that, sanstha- ankekshan kisi bhi sanstha ke hisaab-kitaab kaa kiya ja saktaa he
 Independent person - The audit work should be done by someone who does not have any connection with the business or institution
 tabhi nishpaksh jaanch sambhav he
 Hence presently Chartered Accountants have been appointed
 jaanch kaa swaroop- ankekshan dwaara kii gayi jaanch sirf ganit se sambandhit shuddhta ko hi prakat nahin karti balki yah ek budhimattapurna nishpaksh jaanch he jo hisaab kii purna shuddhta darshaati he
 Accounting books - Auditing involves checking the books of account
 ankekshak ko apana kaaryakshetra sirf pustakon tak hi simit nahin karnaa hota he balki anya vaidhanik pustaken tathaa vibhinn tathyon kii jaankaree bhi kerani hoti hai
 Authenticators and Forms - Audit books are checked on the basis of certifiers and forms, if they are not available, they are confirmed by copies
 soochna evam spashtikaran- jaanch kaa aadhaar pramank hi hote hai phir bhi ankekshak yaaden pramank se santusht nahin he to len-denon kaa satyaapan karne ke liye suchnaayen tathaa spashtikaran maang saktaa he
 Intelligence - The work of investigation by audit is very important, so in this work intelligence and cleverness are required which is gained from the experience of this work
 jaanch kaa uddeshy- lekha-pustakon kii jaanch kaa uddeshy ek nishchit avadhi main banaaye gayi laabh-haani khate ke parinaamon ko evam ek nishchit tithi ko chitthey main darshaye gayi sampatti evam dayitvon kaa satyaapan karnaa he tathaa santushti par pramaan-patr dena hota he
 In fact, the auditor has to express his opinion on the examination of the final accounts
 niyamaanukoolta- bhartiya company adhinium, 1956 ke antargat company kaa chittha va laabh-haani khaataa banaate samay bhi kuch mahatvapurn niyamon ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie
 Therefore, the company auditor has to write in his report whether the letter is the norm or not
 avadhi- ankekshan saadharantah ek vittiya varsh yaa ek lekha varsh ke lekhon kaa kiya jaataa he
 If the accounts of more than one year are audited, this investigation is called research
 parinaam- lekhon kii jaanch ke baad isaki satyata va auchity ke vishay main report deni hoti he
 If the auditor is dissatisfied with anything, it clearly describes it in his report
 lekhankan anivaaryta ke rup main vyaavhaarik rup main lekhankan kaa sambandh vyavsaay ko jivit rakhane ke liye tathaa samaaj main pratishtha praapt karne hetu anivaary hai
 The following arguments can be given for this: aaj ke yug main kisi vyavsaay se hone vaale laabh athwa haani kaa sahi-sahi gyaan bina lekhankan ke sammav nahin he
 If the financial condition of the businessman is strong and the financial resources are very good, then the sale is more as a result of selling cheaper than other businessman, but only after the bankruptcy, he will know that he has sold the item for less than the cost
 vyavsaay main len-dein adhik hote hai visheshtah jahaan udhaar par maal adhik bechaa jaataa he vahaan dendaaron ke naam yaad rakhana sambhav nahin he at: lekhankan anivaary hai
 Profit or loss at the end of a certain period
 iske liye lekhankan anivaary he
 If the professional accounting books are maintained properly, then the current year's income-expenditure or profit-loss can be compared to the profit-loss of previous years
 lekhankan ke madhyam se vyapaaree ko apni vittiya sthiti kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 Articles have great importance in assessment
 yadi lekhe niyamanusaar rakhe hon to yah bahut hi sahaayak siddh hote hai
 The total amount of money that a trader has to pay to a person can be obtained only from accounting
 alaabhprad kriyaaon ko chhodkar laabhprad kriyaayein prarambh karke adhik laabh kamaaya ja saktaa he tathaa yadi kaaryakshmata main kami he to unke kaarnon ko jaanakar unhen dur kiya ja saktaa he
 This work is possible only through accounting
 kisi vyavsaay main yadi uchit rup se lekha-pustaken rakhi jaati hai to us vyavsaay kii pratishtha badhati he
 Accounting also has the following benefits: lekhakarm vilasita ke rup main It is considered a luxury for small traders as they have limited requirements but at the present time it does not seem completely appropriate
 ankekshan vilasita ke rup main Still have to be used to hide the deceit in the accounts, which the auditor cannot catch despite proper cleverness and caution
 at: ankekshan nirarthak he
 On the basis of the above facts, we can say that audit is luxury in small business but it would be wrong for all businesses to call audit as luxury
 choti sansthaaon ke jahaan ek-do karmchaaree hai tathaa lekhakarm kaa kaary swami ekaaki vyapaaree yaa saajhedaar hi dekhte he at: ankekshan aavashyak nahin hai, lekin bade vyavsaay main yah laabhprad evam atyadhik aavashyak he, vilasita nahin
 No luxury of audit karmchaariyon kii kaaryakshmata main vruddhi- ankekshan karwaane ke falswaroop karmchaaree kii kaaryakshmata main vruddhi hoti he kyonki ve jaanate hai ki kaary thik se na karne par ankekshak dwaara truti pakadi ja sakati he ! Increased efficiency of employees - As a result of efficient audit, employees become efficient in their work because the auditor keeps on reporting and deficiencies in his report from time to time and also during the audit
 prabandhakon kii kaaryakshmata main vruddhi- jab prabandhakon ko yah maaloom rahata he ki unke dwaara kiye gayi kaary par ankekshak apni report prastut karegaa jo ki sarvamaanya hogi to ve apana kaary purna eemaandaaree se karenge
 Assistants in the development of business - everyone believes in audited accounts and this increases the fame of business and provides facilities to the business from all sides which leads to the development of business
 diwalia hone kii dasha main nirnay sambhav- yadi lekha-pustaken thik prakaar rakhkar ankekshan karvaa rakhaa he to nyaayalay dwaara rin mukti aadesh praapt karne main sahaayak siddh hote hai
 In the absence of this, it may take longer
 bhavi yojana banane main sahaayak- prabandhak kai varshon ke antim khaaton ke aadhaar par tulanaatmak adhyayan karte hai tathaa yah dekhte he ki kaaryakshmata kis prakaar badhaayi ja sakati he
 Increase in plant and machine efficiency - The audit of cost accounts shows how much functionality the machines have and for what reasons the full functionality of the machines is not being used
 in kaarnon kii jaankaree praapt karkekaryakshmata ko badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Inevitability of audit ankekshan se kaaryakshmata par prabhaav padataa hai at: ise vilasita nahin kaha ja saktaa hai
 In the following situations it is mandatory - is prakaar yah kahana purnroop se satya na hoga ki lekhankan anivaary he or ankekshan vilasita hai
 Accounting is also a luxury in small businesses, while it is compulsory for large businesses
 kintu phir bhi lekhankan va ankekshan ek sikke ke do pahalu hai
 If there is no accounting, then whose audit will be done
 or lekhankan sirf akelaa ho to uski satyata kii vishwasaneeyata nahin he
 Making errors is a part of human nature, the main purpose of audit is to detect and prevent inaccuracy and embezzlement
 ankekshak trutiyon kaa pataa lagane hetu praarambhik lekhon kii jaanch, jarnal kii jaanch, rocked shesh kii jaanch, khaaton ke sheshon kii jaanch, sahaayak bahiyon kii khatauni kii jaanch, gat varsh ke talapat se milan, antar kii raashi kaa pataa lagaana, talapat ke jod kii jaanch aadi kriya apana saktaa hai
 If the auditor used so much care, skill and intelligence in his work as was the case in those circumstances and he had done his utmost, which was absolutely necessary to find the errors
 yadi phir bhi kapat kaa pataa lagane main asamarth rahaa ho to ankekshak ko uttaradaayi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa hai
 Auditing work never means that the auditor has insured the inaccuracies and embezzlement, nor does he guarantee that all the impurities and embezzlement will be found

 The auditor starts the work by setting limits to his work

 Jim Corbett was an Indian writer and philosopher of Irish descent
 unhone maanviya adhikaron ke liye sangharsh kiya tathaa sangrakshit wanon ke andolan kaa bhi prarambh kiya
 He built a residence at Kaladhungi near Nainital
 yah sthaan aaj bhi yahaan aane vaale prarytakon ko us vyakti ke jivan kaa gyaan karaata he jo na keval ek shikari tha balki ek sangrakshak, chamade kaa kaary karne vaala, junglee jaanwaron kaa photo khichne vaala tathaa badhai tha
 He killed many man-eating tigers in Garhwal district of Uttarakhand, including the man-eating leopard of Rudraprayag
 magar baad me unke vichaar palatney se or baaghon kii ghatati sankhya dekhakar inhone sirf chayachitrakarita hi apanaai
 Jim Corbett remained unmarried for a lifetime
 unheen kii tarah unki bahan ne bhi vivaah nahin kiya
 The two brothers and sisters were always together and shared each other's grief
 kumaun tathaa gadhwal main jab koi aadamkhor sher aa jaataa tha to gym corbett ko bulaayaa jaataa tha
 Jim Corbett used to go there, protect everyone and return after killing the man-eating lion
 gym corbett ek kushal shikari the
 He was skilled in hunting here, while he was also a very influential writer
 shikaar-kathaon ke kushal lekhakon main gym corbett kaa naam vishwa main agraniy he
 His 'bhai India' book is very popular
 bharat-prem unka itnaa adhik tha ki ve uske yashgan main lag rahete the
 He was very fond of Kumaon and Garhwal
 aise kumaun - gadhwal ke hamdard vyakti ke naam par gadhwal-kumaun kii dharti par sthapit park kaa hona unhen shraddha ke phool chadhaane ke hi baraabar he
 Therefore, this park which has been built in the name of Jim Corbett has made our nation proud, it is a true tribute to kumaon-garhwal and India towards Jim Corbett
 is lekhak ne bharat kaa naam badhaayaa he
 Today, in the world, his name is taken with respect as a famous hunter
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa vishwa kii pracheen nadi ghati sabhyataaon main se ek pramukh sabhyataa he
 Which is mainly in the northwestern regions of South Asia, which till date has spread to northeast Afghanistan, northwest of Pakistan and north India
 pracheen misr or mesopotamia kii pracheen sabhyataa ke saath, yah pracheen duniya kii sabhyataaon ke teen shuruaati kalkramon main se ek thi, or in teen main se, sabase vyapak tathaa sabase charchit
 According to research published in the respected journal Nature, this civilization is at least 8000 years old
 yah hadappa sabhyataa or 'sindhu-saraswati sabhyataa' ke naam se bhi jaani jaati he
 It developed along the banks of the Indus and Ghaghghar / Hakra
 mohenjodaro, kalibanga, lothal, dholavira, rakhigadhi or hadappa iske pramukh kendra the
 In December 2014, Bhirdana is considered the oldest discovered city of the Indus Valley Civilization so far
 british kaal main hui khudaayiyon ke aadhaar par puratatvvetta or itihaaskaaron kaa anumaan he ki yah atyant viksit sabhyataa thi or ye shahar anek baar based or ujde hai
 For the first time in the 7th century, when people excavated the soil for eto in the province of Punjab, they found it made from what people believed to be the miracle of God and used it to build a house
 Then in 1826 Charles Massen first made this old Discovered civilization
 kaningham ne 1856 main is sabhyataa ke bare main surveykshan kiya
 During the construction of the railway line from Karachi to Lahore in 1856, the Burton brothers informed the Harappan site to the government
 isi kram main 1861 main elexander kaningham ke nirdesan main bhartiya puraatatv vibhaag kii sthapana kii
 In 1904, John Marshall was made director general of the Indian Archaeological Department by Lord Curzon
 flit ne is puraani sabhyataa ke bare main ek lekh likhaa
 In 1921 Dayaram Sahni excavated Harappa
 is prakaar is sabhyataa kaa naam hadappa sabhyataa rakhaa gaya va dayaram saahani ko iskaa khojakarta mana gaya
 This civilization was spread in the Indus River Valley, hence it was named Indus Valley Civilization
 pratham baar nagaron ke udai ke kaaran ise pratham nagarikaran bhi kaha jaataa he
 Due to the use of bronze for the first time, it is also called Bronze Civilization
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke 1400 kendron ko khoja ja sakaa he jisamen se 925 kendra bharat main he
 80 percent of the site is in the vicinity of the Saraswati River and its tributaries
 abhi tak kul khojon main se 3 pratishat sthalon kaa hi utkhanan ho paaya he
 The area of indus Valley Civilization was very wide
 hadappa or mohenjodaro kii khudaai se is sabhyataa ke pramaan mili hai
 Therefore, scholars named it the Indus Valley Civilization, as this area falls in the area of indus and its tributaries, but later the remains of this civilization were also found in areas like Ropar, Lothal, Kalibanga, Vanamali, Rangapur etc
 His tributaries were out of the area
 atah kai itihaaskaar is sabhyataa kaa pramukh kendra hadappa hone ke kaaran is sabhyataa ko "hadappa sabhyataa" naam dena adhik uchit maanate hai
 In 1924 John Marshall, director general of the Archaeological Department, wrote three important texts about the Indus civilization
 is sabhyataa kaa kshetra sansar kii sabhi pracheen sabhyataaon ke kshetra se anek guna bada or vishaal tha
 The centers of this mature civilization were in Punjab and Sindh
 tatpashchaat iskaa vistaar dakshin or purv kii disha main hua
 Thus, under Harappan culture, Punjab was not only a part of Sindh and Baluchistan, but also the marginal parts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh
 iskaa failaav uttar main rahamandheri se lekar dakshin main daimabad tak or pashchim main baluchistan ke makraan samudr tat ke sutkagendoor se lekar uttar purv main meerut or kurukshetra tak tha
 In the initial expansion that was received, the entire area was triangular in this way, this area is not only bigger than modern Pakistan, it is bigger than ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia
 isa purv teesri or duusari sahastrabdi main sansar bhar main kisi bhi sabhyataa kaa kshetra hadappa samskruti se bada nahin tha
 So far, a total of 1000 sites of this culture have been discovered in the Indian subcontinent
 inamen se kuch aarambhik avasthaa ke hai to kuch paripakv avasthaa ke or kuch uttarvarti avasthaa ke
 There are fewer places with a mature state
 inamen se aadhe darjanon ko hi nagar kii sangya di ja sakati he
 Two of these cities are very important - Harappa of Punjab and Mohne of Sindh
 dono hi sthal vartmaan pakistan main hai
 Both were 483 km away from each other and were connected by the Indus River
 teesraa nagar mohen jo dado se 130 kimi dakshin main chanhudado sthal par tha to chauthaa nagar gujarat ke khambhaat kii khadi ke upar lothal naamak sthal par
 Apart from this, Kalibanga in the northern part of Rajasthan and Banavali in Hisar district of Haryana
 in sabhi sthalon par paripakv tathaa unnat hadappa samskruti ke darshan hote hai
 The mature state of this culture is also seen in the coastal towns of Sutkagandor and Surkotada
 in donon kii visheshta he ek ek nagar durg kaa hona
 The North Harappan stage has also been found at Rangpur and Rosadi sites in the Kathiawar peninsula of Gujarat
 is sabhyataa kii jaankaree sabase pehle 1826 main charles main ko praapt hui
 The major cities of the Indus Valley Civilization in three countries are as follows: - bharat ke vibhinn rajyon main sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nimna shahar he:- The most special thing about this civilization was the developed city building scheme here
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado dono nagaron ke apane durg the jahaan shaasha varg kaa parivaar rahata tha
 Each town had a lower level city outside the fort where ordinary people lived in brick houses
 in nagar bhawanon ke bare main vishesh baat ye thi ki ye jaal kii tarah vinyast the
 That is, roads used to cut each other at right angles and the city was divided into many rectangular blocks
 ye baat sabhi sindhu bastiyon par lagu hoti thim chaahe ve choti hon yaa badi
 The buildings of Harappa and Mohan Jodaro were large
 vahaan ke smarak is baat ke pramaan hai ki vahaan ke shaasha majdoor jutaney or kar-sangrah main param kushal the
 Seeing the big building of bricks, even the common people will feel how majestic and dignified these rulers were
 mohan jodado kaa ab tak kaa sabase prasiddh sthal he vishaal saarvajanik snanagar, jiskaa jalashay durg ke tile main he
 This is a beautiful example of brick architecture
 yah 11
88 meter lanbaa, 7
01 meter chaudaa or 2
43 meter gaharaa he
 There are stairs to the floor at both ends
 bagal main kapade badalane ke kamare hai
 The bathroom floor is made of burnt bricks
 paas ke kamare main ek bada sa kuna he jiskaa pani nikaal kar hoj main daalaa jaataa tha
 There is an exit in the corner of the Hauz from which water flowed into the drain
 aisa mana jaataa he ki yah vishaal snanagar dharmanushthan sambandhi snaan fke liye bana hoga jo bharat main paaramparik rup se dharmik kaaryon ke liye aavashyak rahaa he
 Mohan Jodaro has the largest structure - the grain storage hall, which is 45
71 meters long and 15
23 meters wide
 hadappa ke durg main chah kothaar mili hai jo eenton ke chabutare par do paanton main khadey hai
 15
23 m each Long and 6
09 m
 Is wide and some one meter from the river bank
 in baarah ikaiyon kaa talakshetra lagbhag 838
125 varg me
 he jo lagbhag utana hi hota he jitna mohan jodado ke kothaar kaa
 There is an open floor to the south of the Harappan cells and two circular rows of brick are built on it
 farsh kii daraaron main gehun or jau ke dane mili hai
 From this it appears that crop was planted on these platforms
 hadappa main do kamaron vaale barrack bhi mili hai jo shaayad mazdooron ke rahane ke liye bane the
 Kalibangan also has brick platforms in the south part of the city which may have been made for the cellars
 is prakaar yah spasht hota he ki kothaar hadappa samskruti ke abhinn ang the
 The use of brick in Harappan culture cities is a special thing, because in the buildings of Egypt at the same time, only dry brick was used in the sun
 samakaleen mesopatamia main pakki eenton kaa prayog miltaa to he par itane bade paimaane par nahin jitna sindhu ghati sabhyataa main
 Mohan Jodaro's drainage system was amazing
 lagbhag har nagar ke har chote yaa bade makaan main praangan or snanagar hota tha
 Many houses in Kalibangan had their own wells
 gharon kaa pani bahakar sadakon tak aata jahaan inke neeche moriyaan bani thim
 Often these peacocks were covered with bricks and stone blocks
 sadakon kii in moriyon main narmokhe bhi bane hote the
 The remains of roads and peacocks have also been found in Banavali
 sindhu sabhyataa kii arthvyavastha krishi pradhan thi, kintu vyapaar ev pashupaalan bhi prachlan main tha
 Indus region was much more fertile in the east than it is today
 isa-purv chauthi sadi main sikandar ke ek itihaaskaar ne kaha tha ki sindh is desh ke upjau kshetron main gina jaataa tha
 In the past, there was a lot of natural vegetation due to which there was good rainfall
 yahaan ke wanon se inte pakaane or imaarat banane ke liye lakdi bade paimaane par istemaal main laai gai jiske kaaran dhire dhire wanon kaa vistaar simatata gaya
 One of the reasons for the fertility of Indus was the floods coming from the Indus River every year
 gaanv kii raksha ke liye khadi paki eent kii diwaar ingit karti he baadh har saal aati thi
 People here used to sow seeds in the flood plains in the month of November after the floods subsided and harvested wheat and barley in April before the next flood
 yahan koi fawda yaa phal to nahin mila he lekin kalibangan kii prak-hadappa sabhyataa ke jo koont mili hai unase abhas hota he ki rajasthan main is kaal main hal jote jate the
 The people of Indus Valley civilization used to produce grains like wheat, barley, mustard, peas, jowar, etc
 ve do kism kii genhu paidaa karte the
 The barley found in Banawali is of an advanced variety
 iske alaava ve til or sarson bhi upjate the
 First cotton was also grown here
 isi ke naam par yunaan ke log is sinden kehane lage
 Harappa was an agrarian culture, but the people here also practiced animal husbandry
 bail-gaay, bhens, bakrii, bhed or boar paala jaataa tha
 The Harappans had knowledge of elephants and rhinoceros
 yahan ke nagaron main anek vyavsaay-dhandhe prachlit the
 These people were very skilled in making pottery
 mitti ke bartanon par kaale rang se bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke chitra banaaye jate the
 The cloth making business was in advanced stage
 uskaa videshon main bhi niryaat hota tha
 The jeweler's work was also in advanced stage
 manake or taabeej banane kaa kaary bhi lokapriy tha,abhi tak lohe kii koi vastu nahin mili he
 Hence it is proved that they did not have knowledge of iron
 yahaan ke log aapas main pathar, dhaatu shalk aadi kaa vyapaar karte the
 There is evidence of a large number of seals, uniform script and standardized measurement weights in a large area
 ve chakke se parichit the or sambhawatah aajkal ke ikke jaisaa koi vaahan prayog karte the
 They traded with Afghanistan and Iran
 unhone uttari afghanistan main ek vanijyik upnivesh sthapit kiya jisase unhen vyapaar main sahuuliyat hoti thi
 Many Harappan seals have been found in Mesopotamia, suggesting that they also had a trade relationship with Mesopotamia
 mesopotamia ke abhilekhon main meluha ke saath vyapaar ke pramaan mili hai saath hi do madhyavarti vyapaar kendron kaa bhi ullekh miltaa he - dalmun or maakan
 Dilmun can probably be traced to Bahrain in the Persian Gulf
 itnaa to spasht he ki hadappa kii viksit nagar nirmaan pranali, vishaal saarvajanik snanagaron kaa astitv or videshon se vyapaarik sambandhkisi badi rajnatik satta ke bina nahin hua hoga par iske pukhta pramaan nahin mili hai ki yahaan ke shaasha kaise the or shashan pranali kaa swaroop kya tha
 But looking at the municipal system, it seems that there was a local self-governing body like the Municipal Corporation
 hadappa main paki mitti kii stri murtikaayen baari sankhya main mili hai
 An idol depicts a plant growing out of a woman's womb
 vidwaanon ke mat main yah prithvi devi kii pratimaa he or iskaa nikat sambandh paudhon ke janm or vruddhi se rahaa hoga
 Therefore, it seems that people here considered the earth to be the goddess of fertility and worshiped it in the same way as the Egyptians of Isis, the goddess of the Nile River
 lekin pracheen misr kii tarah yahaan kaa samaaj bhi matra pradhan tha ki nahin yah kahana mushkil he
 Some Vedic hymns praise Prithvi Mata, a well has been found in the fort of Dholavira, it has a staircase leading downwards, and there was a window in it where evidence of lighting a lamp is found
 us kuen main saraswati nadi kaa pani aata tha, to shaayad sindhu ghati ke log us kuen ke jariye saraswati kii puja karte the
 a seal is found in the cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, which has a portrait of a yogi with 3 or 4 faces, many scholars believe that this yogi is Shiva
 mewar jo kabhi sindhu ghati sabhyataa kii seemaa main tha vahaan aaj bhi 4 mukh vaale shiv ke avatar eklinganath ji kii puja hoti he
 The people of the Indus Valley Civilization used to burn their dead bodies, cities like Mohan Jodaro and Harappa had a population of around 50 thousand but still only around 100 have been found, which indicates that they burnt the bodies
 lothal, kalibanga aadi jagahon par havan kund mili he jo kii unke vaidic hone kaa pramaan he
 Pictures of Swastik are also found here
 kuch vidwaan maanate he ki hindu dharm dravido kaa mul dharm tha or shiv dravido ke devtaa the jinhen aaryon ne apana liya
 Some Jain and Buddhist scholars also believe that the Indus Valley Civilization was of Jainism or Buddhism, but mainstream historians have denied this and there is not much evidence of this
 pracheen misr or mesopotamia main puratatvavidon ko kai mandiron ke avshesh mili he par sindhu ghati main aaj tak koi mandir nahin mila, marshall aadi kai itihaaskaar maanate he ki sindhu ghati ke log apane gharo main, kheto main yaa nadi kinare puja kiya karte the, par abhi tak keval brihatsnanagar yaa vishaal snanaghar hi ek aisa smarak he jise poojasthal mana gaya he
 Today, as Hindus go to bathe in the Ganges, the Sandhav people used to take a holy bath here
 haan Although the people of this era used many tools and tools of stone, they were well aware of the construction of bronze
 tambe tathaa tin milakar dhaatushilpi kaansya kaa nirmaan karte the
 However, neither mineral was abundant in either
 sooti kapade bhi bune jate the
 People also built boats
 mudra nirmaan, murti kaa nirmaan ke saat baratan bananaa bhi pramukh shilp tha
 Like ancient Mesopotamia, people here also invented the art of writing
 harappai lipi kaa pehla namoona 1853 isvi main mila tha or 1923 main puri lipi prakaash main ai parantu ab tak padhi nahin ja saki he
 Knowledge of the script made accounting of personal property easier
 vyapaar ke liye unhen maap taul kii aavashyaktaa hui or unhonen iskaa prayog bhi kiya
 Many items like weights have been found
 unase pataa chalata he ki taul main 16 yaa uske aavartakon kaa upyog hota tha
 The interesting thing is that till modern times India used to have 1 rupee 16
 1 kilo main 4 pav hote the or har pav main 4 canavaan yani ek kilo main kul 16 canavaan
 This civilization was predominantly 2500 BC From 1800 BC Stayed till aisa abhas hota he ki yah sabhyataa apane antim charan main hrasonmukh thi
 At this time, information about the use of old bricks is available in houses
 iske vinaash ke kaarnon par vidwaan sahamat nahin hai
 Various arguments are given behind the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization, such as: invasions, climate change and ecological imbalances, floods and geothermal changes, epidemics, economic causes
 aisa lagata he ki is sabhyataa ke patan kaa koi ek kaaran nahin tha balki vibhinn kaarnon ke mail se aisa hua
 Which is likely to happen at different times or together
 mohenjo daro main nagar or jal nikaas ki vyavastha se mahamari ki sambhaavna kam lagati he
 Evidence of severe firefighting has also been obtained
 mohenzodaro ke ek kamare se 14 nar kankal mili he jo akraman, aagjanee, mahamari ke sanket he

 Examples chaturangini - pracheen bhartiya sangathit sena
 The four parts of the army are known as Hasti, Ashwa, Rath, Padati and the army in which these four are called Chaturangini
 chaturangbal shabd bhi itihaspuraanon main miltaa he
 The general rule in this subject is that 10 chariots with each chariot, 10 horse with each yard, 10 horse with each horse lived as guard, thus the army was usually chaturangi
 sena kii sabase choti tukdi 'patti' kehalaati he, jisamen ek gaj, ek rath, teen ashv, paanch padaati hote the
 Three such leaves were called Senamukh
 is prakaar teen teen guna kar yathakram gulm, gana, vahini, prutna, chamu or anikini kaa sanghathan kiya jaataa tha
 10 Anikini was equal to one Akshauhini
 tadnusaar ek akshuhinee main 21870 gaj, 21970 rath, 65610 ashv or 109350 padaati hote the
 The total used to be 218700
 kehete hai, kurukshetra ke yuddh main aisi 18 akshuhinee sena ladi thi
 This magnitude of Akshauhini is mentioned in Mahabharata
 mahabharat main main sena pariman kii jo gananaa he, usase is gananaa main kuch vilakshantaa he
 The 'ashtanga Sena' is mentioned in Shantiparva 59 / 41-42, the first four are the Chaturangini Army also

 abhikalp yaa dizin shabd kaa upyog prayukt kalaon, abhiyantriki, vaastushilp evam isi tarah ke anya srujanaatmak kaaryon evam kshetron main kiya jaataa he
 It is used as a verb and as a noun
 kriya ke rup main dizin kaa arth us prakriya se he jo kisi utpaada, dhaancha, tantra yaa saamaan ko astitv main laane yaa uske vikaas ke liye apanaayi jaati he
 The word design as a noun is used in two meanings - aajkal prakriyaayonko bhi dizin kaa parinaam mana jaataa he
 Process design is used in this sense
 dizin ke antargat bahut se lakshya nirdhaarit kiye gayi hote hai
 Among these, the main requirements are - work related, size and volume, price or cost related, power requirement, maintenance and improvement related to deterioration, ease of interconnecting different parts, ease of manufacture and production etc
 abhiklpana kisi purvanishchit dhyey kii uplabdhi ke liye tatsambandhi vichaaron evam anya sabhi sahaayak vastuon ko krambaddh rup se suvyavasthit kar dena hi 'abhiklpana' he
 Architects plan the construction of a building by marking the lines in various forms, thinking of the accomplishment of a single goal
 kalakaar bhi rekhaon ke sangyojan se chitra main ek vishesh prabhaav yaa vichaar upasthit karne kaa praytn karata he
 Similarly, the building engineer assigns various measurements to a building to ensure its durability and firmness
 sabhi baaten abhiklpana ke antargat hai
 It is the duty of the architect to present a viable design that is convenient and economical in the goal of building construction
 saath hi use yah bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie ki imaarat kaa aakaar us kshetra ke pados ke anukool ho or apane id-gird khadi puraani imaaraton ke saath bhi uskaa mail baith sake
 Suppose all the houses around Eid are arched doorways, then a flat stop between them will not suit the flat-faced house
 isi tarah or bhi kai baaten hai jinka vichaar parshvavarti vaataavaran ko drushti main rakhte hue kiya janaa chahie
 The second special thing that is considered for the architect is the decision of a stable opinion about the exterior shape of the building
 vah aisa hona chahie ki ek raah chalata vyakti bhi bhawan ko dekhakar puche bina yah samaj le ki vah bhawan kisalie bana he
 For example, a college should not look like a hospital, nor should the shape of a hospital be like a college
 banks kaa bhawan dekhne main pusht or surakshit laganaa chahie or naatakghar yaa cinemaghar kaa bahari drishy shobhaneey hona chahie
 The architect should be sure that he has made full use of the entire area on which he has to build the building
 kalapurna abhiklpanaaon ke antargat manoranjan athwa rangamanch ke liye parde rangnaa, alankaran ke liye vibhinn prakaar ke chitrankan, kisi vishesh vichaar ko abhivyakt karne ke liye bhittichitra bananaa aadi kaary bhi aate hai
 The quality of the artist is to give real shape to his design
 chitra ko kalakaar ke vichaaron kii sajiv abhivyakti kaa pratik hona chahie
 According to the requirement of the painting, the artist made pencil sketches, oil paintings, watercolor paintings etc
 imaaraton ke ejeeniyar ko vaastuvid kii abhiklpana ke anusaar hi apni abhiklpana aisi banani hoti he ki imaarat apane par padanevaale sab bhaaron ko sanbhaalane ke liye yathesht pusht ho
 With this in view, he selects the specific equipment for construction and orders the installation of such construction material so as to make the building affordable and durable
 iske liye is baat kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana aavashyak he ki nirmaan ke liye sujhaaye gaye vishisht padaarth bazaar main uplabdh hai yaa nahin, athwa sujhai gai vishisht kaaryastylee ko karyanvit karne ke liye abhisht dakshata kaa abhaav to nahin he
 In estimating the weight, the weight of the building itself, its moving load when it is being built or used, the impact of shock of moving loads, wind pressure, the result of earthquake bumps, heating, shrinkage, foundation seating etc
 Have to keep in mind
 inamen se kuch bhaaron kii gananaa to sookshmata se kii jaae sakati he, kintu kai aise bhi hai jinhen vigat anubhavon ke aadhaar par keval anumaanit kiya ja saktaa he
 Take the force of an earthquake --- it is very difficult to estimate and there can be no preconception of how much force and where the earthquake will occur
 tathaapi saubhagyavash adhiktar chal or achal bhaaron ke prabhaav kii gananaa bahut kuch thik-thik kii ja sakati he
 Adequate correct estimation of heat and shrinkage pressure can also be done by studying the interference in the heat of the entire cycle cycle and the known properties of concrete
 hawa evam bukamp ke kaaran padanevaale bal antatogatva anishchit hi hote hai, parantu unki maatra ke anumaan main thodi truti rahane se praaia: haani nahin hoti
 The construction material is generally confirmed so that even if there is a 33 percent increase in the forces of pressure, there is no possibility of any loss
 neenv ke dhansane kaa acha anumaan neeche kii bhoomi kii upyukt jaanch se ho jaataa he
 Each designer also has to take into account some unknown facts, such as the inability of the craftsmen, the burden of unthinkable crowds of people at some time, the hidden potential weaknesses of the substances used, etc
 in tathyon ko 'surakshagunak' ke antargat rakhaa jaataa he, jo ispaat ke liye 2 se 1 / 2 or kancreet, shateer tathaa anya upkarnon ke liye 3 se 4 tak mana jaataa he
 The safety factor should not be used as an excuse to carry additional load on the building
 yah keval agyaat kaarnon ke liye he or ek seemaa tak hraas ke liye bhi, jo bhavishya main bhawan ko dhakke, jarjarata evam mausam kii anischitataayen sahan karne ke liye sahaayak siddh ho saktaa he
 The Banihal Pass is a major pass in the Himalayas

 When milking by hand became inefficient or labor intensive, machines were used for milking cows
 The milking unit is a part of the machine to extract milk from a udder
 yah ek panja he, jo chaar chuchuk kaps, lambii doodh tub, lambii dhadkan tub or ek compymanak se bana he
 The claws are attached to a long pulse tube and the short pulse tube to the chukuk tube and the long pulse milk tube
 panje saamanytah steneles steel yaa plastic yaa donon se bane hote hai
 Chuchuk Cups are composed of a rigid outer shell whose inner part is soft or inflated
 khol main paardarshee virgon se doodh ke pravaah ko dekha ja saktaa he
 The annular armor between the shell and the liner is called the pulse chamber
 doodh dene kii mashin ek prakaar se haath se duhane yaa bachade ke doodh pine ke tareeke se alag he
 Massage is applied to remove milk by continuously vacuuming a pressure across the soft teat
 nirvaat gaay se mashin ko jode rakhane main madad bhi karata he
 Applying vacuum to the teat causes congestion on the teat tissue
 vayumandaleey hawa dhadkan kaksh main daalaa jaataa he ek baar prati second taaki liner chuchee ke ant ke aasapaas patan ke liye or chuchee utakon main jamaav ko raahat dene kii anumati mili
 khulanaa or band ke samay ke anupaat ko dhadkan anupaat kaha jaataa he
 The milk is usually pumped out of the four streams by a cup of chukuk and combined into the claw and stored in the bucket through the milk tube, then the milk is combined by pressure or air into a central storage tub or bulk tank by mechanical pump
 
 lagbhag sabhi deshon main farm par doodh ko thanda kiya jaataa he phir ise garm-excanger dwaar nikaalkar thok tanks main rakhaa jaataa he
 a stainless steel bucket is visible at the top of the cow in the picture above, this is the bucket milking system

 The flexible liner is visible on the outside of the shell with small milk tubes and small pulsation tubes extending to the bottom of the shells
 panje ke neeche kaa bhaag paardarshee he jahaan se doodh ke pravaah kaa avlokan kar sakate hai
 When the milking is complete, the vacuum of the machine closes and the teatcups are removed
 doodh dene kii mashin doodh ko pruthak or bahya sankraman se surakshit rakhti he
 The internal 'milk contact' surfaces of the machine are kept clean by manual or automated washing procedures
 doodh sampark satahon ke saath vishesh niyamon kii aavashyak khaadya grad saamagree kaa paalan karnaa chahie jise aasaani se saaf kiya ja sake
 Most milking machines are powered by electricity, but when there is no electricity, there is also an alternative energy system that runs the internal engine, vacuum and milk pump
 dudharu gaay duhane ke samay main aniyamitata nahin sah paati hai jabatak doodh utpaadan main koi gambhir katautee na ho
 Patti-style sheds - This type of milking facility was first developed after milking in an open paddock
 ek lambii sankeern, patali, ek taraf se jhuki or khuli hui lambii shed kaa nirmaan kiya gaya
 The cows were kept on the open side of the yard and they were made to stand in a strip while milking
 aamtaur par gaayon ko ek shrinkhalaa main niyantrit rakhane ke liye unke peeche ke pairon ko rassi se baandh diya jaataa tha
 The cows could not move much from their place and could not kick the milker when the milk milker sat on a stool and extracted milk in a bucket
 jab prayek gaay se doodh nikaalane kaa kaam samaapt ho jaataa to unhen waapas apni jagah par bhej diya jaataa tha
 In Britain, this type of shed was developed by Rex Patterson, with six mobile standing sheds on which cows would be erected so that shepherds would not have to bend too low
 The milking device was modern-day, a vacuum from a pump, pulsation, claw with pipe, armor and liners that excite and suck milk from the teat causing a vacuum from a claw piece along the pipe
 The milk goes into a churn through the cooler
 jaise hi jhund ke aakaar main vruddhi hoti thi prayek pattee ke saamne ek darwaja sthapit kar diya jaataa tha taaki jaise hi gaay ko duhane kaam puraa ho, pairon main bandhi rassi ko kholkar dur se hi us daravaaje ko kholkar gaay ko baahar charne ke liye bhej diya jaataa tha
 The door used to be locked, the next cow secured in a strip
 jab doodh dene kii mashin kii shuruuaat kii gai to ek jode main gaayon se doodh nikaala jaataa tha tabatak anya ko doodh dene ke liye taiyaar kiya jaataa tha
 At the end of the earlier machine cup was applied to the other cow
 yah bilkul swingover doodh duhane kaa parlor ke samaan tha jiskaa varnan neeche kiya gaya he
 With the increase in the number of herds, instead of increasing the number of strips, milk was easily milked from cows by double doubling the number of cups
 ek shed main ghante bhar main 8 pattiyon ke saath ek vyakti dwaara 50 gaayon ko duh liya jaataa he, baar-baar gaayon ke liye ek hi chuchee cap kaa upyog karne se sankraman, stan kii sujan sanchaarit hone kaa khatra rahata he
 Some farmers have found their own ways to disinfect cows groups
 herringbon milking parlor -herringbon milking shed yaa parlor main, gaay ekal tareeke se pravesh karti hai or unhen galiyare main lagbhag lambavatt khadaa kar doodh duhanevaale apana kaam karte hai than or chuchuk kii dhulaai ke baad or doodh dene kii mashin ke cap ko gaayon ko laga diya jaataa, unke pichley pairon ke peeche se, kaam karne ke kshetra ke donon kinaaron par
 bade herringbon shed main do logon ke saath 600 gaayon se kushaltapurvak doodh nikaala ja saktaa he
 Swingover milking parlor - Swingover parlor is exactly the same as herringbone parlor with only one set of milking cups between two rows of cows, which are shared between the cows, with one side replaced by the other after milking
 It is done
 is pranali kaa laabh yah he ki yah kam mahangaa he, halaki isse 100 gaayon se adhik ke doodh ke liye koshish nahin kii ja sakati lekin yah aadhe gati se adhik behatar rup se sanchalit he
 Rotary Milking Shed - Rotary milking sheds have a rotating wheel with approximately 12 to 100 separate stalls for cows around the outer end
 ek "achche" rotary ke saath ek saath 24-32 stallon ek yaa duhane waalon dwaara sanchalit kiya ja saktaa he
 The cycle is driven by an electric motor and rotates at such a speed that milk is completely released from one cow at a time
 As soon as a stall is empty, a cow steps in from the entrance and starts walking with the wheel
 isprakaar agali gaay agle khaali stall ke taraf chali jaati he
 The operator or milk weaners clean the nipples and attach them to the cup and do any other food or whatever work is necessary
 jabatak doodh nikaala jaataa he gaayen manch par hi rahati hai
 The milker, or an automatic device, removes the cup of the milking machine and holds the cow's back and leaves it at an exit just before the entrance
 rotary pranali ek hajaar gaayon se bhi adhik bade jhund kaa doodh duhane main sakasham he
 Automatic Milking Sheds - Automatic milking or 'robotic milking' sheds can be seen in Australia, New Zealand and many European countries
 Current automatic milking sheds use the voluntary milking method
 isamen gaayon ko swechha se din ho yaa raat ke kisi bhi samay doodh dene ke liye khud ko prastut karte hai, haalanki dohraane kaa daura computer software ke madhyam se kisaan dwaara simit kiya ja saktaa he
 a robot arm cleans the device and the nipple before being used for milking, while the gates move the cow out of the way automatically, during which the farmer does not need to be present
 The entire process is controlled by a computer
 yahaan swat: pranali kaa vivaran diya gaya he- Supplementary Equipment in the Shed - Farmers soon realized that a milking shed was a good supplementary diet for cows that could be fueled by a lack of local diet or 'cows' goodness and production
 prayek puaal ke box ko is prakaar rakhaa jaataa he ki gaay ke aate hi use khaanaa mil jaae taaki duhane ke samay main vah khaati rahe
 ek computer prayek jaanavar ke liye sahi poorak rashan ko pard saktaa he
 In the stalls of a close alternative 'out-of-parlor-feeder', a transponder around the neck of the cow, it was programmed to benefit by providing the main ration for each cow, depending on the age and production capacity of the cow 
 shed ke pravesh dwaar par gaayon ko pakad kar shed main rakhane ke liye shed yard ek mahatvapurn saadhan he
 a powered gate ensures how cows are kept closed
 deyari farm par pani bahut mahatvapurn he: gaayon dinabhar main 20 galen pani pi leti hai or baaki pani kii jarurat shed ko saaf or svachh rakhane ke liye hoti he
 Pumping and reservoir facilities are common in milking locations
 pani ko doodh ke saath garmi hastantaran dwaara garam kiya ja saktaa he
 The milk coming from the cow is transported around the cup by air inlet in a special claw to a storage container near it
 vahaan se yah ek yantric pump dwaara nikaala or garmi excanger dwaara thanda kiya jaataa he doodh ke bade bartan yaa thok tanks main sangrahit kar, aamtaur par prashitit kar sansaadhit kiya jaataa he Subject: aise deshon main, jahaan gaay saal bhar baahar jaakar charati hai vahaan bahut kam apshisht niptaan karnaa padataa he
 The most waste milk is at the milking shed, where animal waste is liquefied and poured with ponds anaerobic bacteria mixed with effluent or with a solid pump
 sansaadhit pani or poshak tatwon ko pump dwaara waapas nikaalkar urvarak ke rup main sinchai ke kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 Surplus animals are converted to sacrificial meat and to other products
 sambaddhit doodh processing kaarkaanon main, aamtaur par dhulaai ke baad bachaa hua ganda pani hi apshisht hota he jise parishkrut karne ke baad jalmaarg main lautaa diya jaataa he
 This is very different from half a century ago when the main products were butter, cheese, and casein, and the rest of the milk was disposed of as waste
 aise kshetron main jahaan gaayon puure varsh bhar rakhe jate hai, apshisht kii samasya bahut jatil hoti he bachi hui khaadya saamagree he or beding apshisht ko bhi sangrahit kar nipataara karnaa padataa he
 The size of this problem can be seen in the standing enclosure where such dairy is run
 kai maamalon main, aadhunik formon main bahut badi maatra main prasanskaran ke liye doodh ko kaarkaane main bheja jaataa he
 Attempting to dispose of huge amounts of milk can be a major disaster if anything goes wrong or something goes wrong with milking, transportation or processing facilities
 agar sadak par tanker palat jaataa he to sadak par bachaav dal ko 20-45 hajaar galen doodh ko niptaana padataa he
 a derailed tanker train can contain 10 times more volume than this
 prashithan ke bina, doodh nasht ho jaataa he or ucch jaev rasinic oxigen kii maang ke kaaran yah vaataavaran ke liye bahut hanikaarak hota he
 a massive power blackout is a disaster for the dairy industry as both milking and processing facilities are affected
 is ke liye, farm aksar mobile janarator kaa upyog kar sakate hai
 Such a situation was encountered during the 2010 Canterbury earthquake
 deyari pradhan kshetron main, doodh kii ek badi maatra ke liye vibhinn tareekon ke niptaan kaa prastaav rakhaa gaya he
 These include feeding area animals, spray irrigation and sacrificial areas
 bhoomi par doodh ko failaane se, yaa kisi chhed main ise daalane se bahut badi samasya kaa saamana karnaa padataa he kyonki doodh ke chacha bhoomi ke chhed ko band kar dete hai or pani mitti ke madhyam se jameen ke andar ja nahin paata he
 It can take a long time to recover from its effects, any land based application must be managed well
