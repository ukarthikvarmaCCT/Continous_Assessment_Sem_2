 Metaphor or feature is a narrative article that appeals to people, which is not related to recent news but focuses on a particular person, place, or event
 vistaar kii drushti se roopak main bahut gaharaai hoti he
 Today, feature writing and its presentation have become extremely important in modern journalism
 samachar agar patrakarita kii ridh he to feechar patrakarita kaa soundarya badhaane vaali shakti
 News in journalism, where there is a precise record of immediate events, then the metaphor means that apart from the immediate form of the feature news, its detail, its graphical presentation or the details of the entire event related to it
 aadhunik patrakarita main ab sthanbhav ke kaaran samachar lekhan main shabdon kii seemaa tay kar di gai he or patrkaar ko usee shabd seemaa main sab kuch kahana hota he
 In this case, the feature acts as a facilitator for the journalist
 feechar main graphics, chitron, rekhachitron or sankshipt prastutikaran ke jariye bahut chote sthaan main bahut kuch kaha, likhaa yaa prastut kiya ja saktaa he
 The metaphor has evolved from descriptive works, but due to the limitation of words and space, the features are also becoming narrower
 haalaanki sankshipt hone ke baavjood feechar kaa mahatv kam nahin hua he balki or adhik bad gaya he
 The expansion of the news in the feature itself is presented with a special technique
 iske liye feechar lekhak ko yah pataa karnaa hota he ki samachar kaa mukhya vishay yaa mukhya paatr koun he? samachar ke mukhya vishay ke saath jude pramukh tatv kya hai? le khak ko is sabkon prastut karte samay usamen vyaktigat sparsh bhi dena hota he
 Features presented in an entertaining way along with a touch of human emotion are more popular because they provide information about the entire elements of the subject as well as entertain the reader, listener or viewer
 samachar tathyon kaa vivaran tathaa vichaar dekar khatm ho jaataa he jabaki feechar main ghatana athwa vishay ke parivesh, vividh pakshon tathaa uske prabhaavon kaa varnan hota he
 The news does not reflect the writer's thoughts or his personality, while the feature reflects the writer's ideology, his imagination as well as his personality
 feechar main katha tatv kii pradhanta rahati he yani uske lekhan yaa prastuti main saralata or pravaah donon hi hote hai
 But the feature is not merely a story
 feechar kalpanajagat kii baton main kho jane ke bajaay vishay kii gaharaai main jaakar pathakon kii jigyaasa ko shant karne kaa kaam karata he
 Feature writing is an artistic work and for any journalist to become a good feature writer - feechar samaacharon ke prastutikaran kii hi ek vidha he lekin samachar kii tulana main feechar main gahan adhyayan, chitron, shodh or saakshaatkaar adike jariye vishay kii vyakhya hoti he
 He has a detailed presentation and all this happens in such a smooth and interesting manner that the reader is bound in his flow
 patrakarita or sahitya ke vidwaanon ne roopak kii alag-alag paribhaashaayen gadhi hai
 By one definition, ek anya paribhaasha ke anusaar, In another definition, the feature has been called the 'soul of the newspaper'
 saamaanya shabdon main kahen to samachar kaa kaam tatthy or vichaar dekar khatm ho jaataa he
 Whereas feature work goes beyond this
 yah samachar kii prishthbhumi kaa khulaasa karte hai, vishay yaa ghatana ke janm or vikaas kaa vivaran dete hai
 They also reveal the subject or event in full detail and make the reader think
 ek achche feechar kii sarthakata isi baat main he ki vah apane pathakon ke man mashtishk par kitna prabhaav daalati he
 The feature writer also informs the reader about his reaction or idea about the event or topic and thus affects the reader's imaginations and his conceptual mindset
 feechar kaa mahatv isi baat main he ki yah kab, kyon, kaise, kahaan or koun ko spasht karne vaale samachar yani news se aage jaakar tatthy kalpana or vichaar kii santulit prastuti ke jariye apana ek vishesh prabhaav chodta he
 One of the features of the feature is that it satisfies the curiosity of the reader after reading any news
 aajkal samachar patron main ficharon kaa upyog dinondin badhata ja rahaa he
 There may be a locality in Indian linguistic newspapers for detailed news on the tremendous winter and snowfall in Europe
 lekin isi vishay ko mahaj ek choti si jagah main ek sachitr feechar ke jariye prastut kar akhbaar apane sthanbhav kii samasya se bhi ubar sakate hai or pathak ko barf se jame europe ke bare main sampoorn jaankaree bhi mil jaati he
 Similarly, along with the news of a local accident, if the details of other such incidents, preventive measures, experiences of the affected, etc
 are presented as an illustrated feature, then the reader gets all the information together
 feechar ke is upyog ne aaj feechar ke mahatvako atyadhik badha diya he
 Due to this growing importance, feature writing has also become an important genre of journalism
 isi ke saath feechar lekhakon kaa mahatv bhi badhata ja rahaa he
 Today, the importance of feature desks in newspapers has also increased and their utility
 samachar patron main ab feechar ke kaaran behatar prastutikaran or taatkalikta par adhik dhyaan diya jane laga he
 Many large newspaper groups have now started centralized feature writing system, under which features on important subjects are prepared and sent for all editions of the newspaper
 internet or soochna takanic ke chamatkaaron ne aaj feechar lekhan ko aasaan bana diya he
 But due to these miracles, new challenges have also arisen in the field of feature writing today
 aaj feechar lekhak ko is cheez par sarvaadhik dhyaan dena padataa he ki uske feechar main saare tatthy ekadam sahi hon, taaje hon, samichin hon or ve pathak kii sari jigyaasaaon kaa samaadhaan bhi kar saken
 Feature is a genre of journalism in which writing cannot be tied to a particular range of rules
 viksit deshon main patrakarita kii ek vidha ke rup main feechar lekhan bahut lokapriy he
 Since journalism was born and developed in India with politics, the feature's development journey here started relatively late
 yahan praarambhik patrakarita main kalam kaa upyog talwaar ke rup main kiya gaya
 In the post-independence years, and especially in the post-emergency years, newspapers had stepped up the task of exploring the larger dimensions of life beyond politics and understanding life in its entirety
 isi ke chalate hamaare desh main feechar lekhan kii ek vishisht style viksit hui
 The revolutionary changes in printing technology have doubled the utility, need and importance of feature writing
 feechar rachana kaa mukhya niyam yah he ki feechar aakarshak, tatthyatmakaur manoranjak hona chahie
 Currently, there is no longer any kind of layout, decoration, shape-type or word limit for the feature
 aaj kam se kam shabdon main feechar rachana ko adhik mahatvapurn mana jane laga he
 In the same way, instead of one big work on one subject, features are also being written by presenting many small information and materials simultaneously
 mote taur par feechar lekhan ke liye 5 mukhya baton kaa dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he- Feature writing is also an art and now that the features of the feature are changing, the technique and methods of feature writing are also changing

 Mahakampur is a village in Raigarh district under the Chhattisgarh state of India in the Sarangarh division
 audichya brahman ke rup main mul itihaas varsh 950 i
 ke aasapaas se paaya jaataa he
 It is known that in the year 942 AD, Moolraj Solanki captured the throne of Anilpur Patan by killing his maternal uncle and the then king Samanta Singh Chavda
 un dinon sattarudh raja kii hatya or pujari kii hatya jaise aparaadhon ko akshamya aparaadh mana jaataa tha jisaki sajaa aatmadah thi or jiskaa parimarjan keval shrimali brahmanon ke dwaara hi sambhav hota tha
 However, when Mulraj became notorious as the culprit for the murder of Raja Samant Singh, the beloved of the Shrimalis, the Shrimali Brahmins strictly refused to scrape this heinous crime and declare Mulraj as the king
 arse se chaawda raajaaon ke saath jude rahe gujarat ke ye yaajak brahman shrimaal bhinnmal, jo ki rajasthan ke dakshini bhaag main sthit, se aaye the
 Shrimali Brahmin was the state's state priest
 unke kaaryon main, dharm or nyaay shaamil tha
 He refused to bless Moolraj and proclaimed him as the king
 kisi bhi tarah se unhen samajhane, dhan, dhamkee aadi kaa un brahmanon par koi prabhaav nahin padaa
 Then as an undeclared king, Moolraj resolved to perform 'rudra Yajna' as a penance and build a huge Rudra temple
 phir bhi shrimali brahman pujarigan nahin maane
 The Srimali Brahmins, who were adamant on the self-immolation of Moolraj, were then told about the future destruction and anarchy of the state of Gujarat, but this too had no effect on them
 usee samay kai chaawda vanshajon kaa singhaasana ke liye daawey bhi aane shuru ho gaye the
 Enemies on the state's border intensified their enthusiasts to conquer Gujarat
 agar rajya ko banaae rakhana tha to nishchay hi mulraj or shrimalion ke bich sulah kii atyadhik zarurat thi lekin shrimali yaajak paristhitiyon ko samajhane ke baad bhi mulraj ko hatya ke dand se mukt karne ke pakshdhar nahin hue
 Ultimately, Moolraj's friends and members of the cabinet secretly decided to bring scholarly Brahmins from different parts of the country and give them what they had been getting till now
 turant is kaam ko karne ke liye mantri madhav ke netritv main kai dalon ko ganga or yamuna nadiyon ke maidaanon main sthit vibhinn mahatvapurn va brahman bahul ilaakon main bheja gaya or vahaan ke vidwaan brahmanon ko lubhaavne sthaayee pravaas va anupam rajkeey prashray va vyavastha kaa lobh dekar gujarat aane ke liye raji karavaaya gaya
 To avoid any future conspiracy, it was also ensured that all Brahmins were brought from different places
 mulraj or unke mantri madhav ne is babat apane purakhon kii bhoomi kanyakubj se bulaae gaye brahmanon ko praathamikta di taaki anya sahit purv ke shrimali brahmanon ke varchasv kii kami ho sake
 Thus Moolraj could be a Vaidya king himself and would continue to hold on to the newcomer Brahmin families
 is prakaar yojananusaar 1037 brahman pariwaron kaa ek bada kaaravaan siddhpur patan pahunchaa
 Till now, the undeclared King Moolraj got the convenience of more than the promised promises and made him his forever
 paramparaagat rup se brahmanon ko apane pravaas yaa mul ke sthaan ke dwaara janaa jaataa tha
 Hence, this large group of Brahmins, coming from the north and consisting of various gotras of the past, was officially named Sahastra Audichya Brahmin
 sanskrit main, audichya kaa arth uttari disha se he
 Thus gotra origin remained unchanged and the location provided by King Moolraj Solanki, Sri Sthal, which later became known as Siddhpur Patan, became his permanent place
 is prakaar gotrake naam or sankhya, pariwaron ke unke mul sthaan par basane ke anusaar hui

 Out of 1037 families, 37 families, considering the truth of the Shrimali Brahmins, decided not to participate in the king's plan

 King Moolraj Solanki explained the Brahmins of the other side

 It was necessary to keep them all as their own

 At the same time, ten to fifteen groups were formed only during these years due to the disorganization of Gujarat

 At the same time, due to famine and terrorist attacks in Gujarat, many groups started leaving other places in Gujarat, in a large group 1200 trains came to Ujjain

 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga Karma Yoga Yoga Karma Kishalayam means getting absorbed in karma
 yoga: karmsu kaushalm
 In this yoga, God is achieved through karma
 shrimadbhagavadgita main karmyog ko sarvshereshth mana gaya he
 This yoga is more suitable for a householder and a working person
 hamamen se prayek kisi na kisi kaary main laga hua he, par hamamen se adhikansh apni shaktiyon kaa adhiktar bhaag vyarth kho dete hai; kyonki ham karm ke rahasy ko nahin jaanate
 To protect life, to protect society, to protect the country, to protect the world, karma is necessary
 kintu yah bhi ek satya he ki du:kha kii utpatti karm se hi hoti he
 All sorrows and sufferings arise from attachment
 koi vyakti karm karnaa chahta he, vah kisi manushya kii bhalaai karnaa chahta he or is baat kii bhi prabal sambhaavna he ki upakrit manushya kritagn nikalegaa or bhalaai karne vaale ke viruddh kaary karegaa
 In this way, Sukriti also causes sorrow
 fal yah hota he ki is prakaar kii ghatana manushya ko karm se dur bhagaati he
 This fear of sorrow or suffering destroys a large part of karma and power
 karmyog sikhaata he ki karm ke liye karm karo, aasaktirahit hokar karm karo
 The Karmayogi works because he likes to do the work and has nothing to do beyond it
 karmyogi karm kaa tyaag nahin karata vah keval karmfal kaa tyaag karata he or karmjanit du:khon se mukt ho jaataa he
 His position is like that of a giver in this world and he never worries to get anything
 vah jaanata he ki vah de rahaa he or badale main kuch maangata nahin or isiilie vah du:kha ke changul main nahin padataa
 He knows that the bond of sorrow results from the reaction of 'attachment'
 gita main kaha gaya he ki man kaa samatv bhav hi yoga he jisamen manushya sukh-du:kha, laabh-haani, jai-paraajay, sanyog-viyog ko samaan bhav se chitt main grahan karata he
 By sacrificing the fruits of karma, the execution of secular work also becomes similar to worship
 sansar kaa koi kaary brahm se alag nahin he
 Therefore, no matter the nature of the work, uninterrupted karma is always dedicated to God
 punarjanm kaa kaaran vaasanaon yaa atrupt kaamanaayon kaa sanchay he
 Karmayogi does not fall in the circle of karma, so there is no accumulation of desires
 is prakaar karmyogi punarjanm ke bandhan se bhi mukt ho jaataa he
 Karmayoga has been elaborated in the Gita
 bhartiya darshan main karm, bandhan kaa kaaran mana gaya he
 But in Karmayoga, the form of karma is represented which is not the cause of bondage
 yoga kaa arth he samatv kii prapti 
 Equality in accomplishment and success, success and failure is called equanimity
 yoga kaa ek anya arth bhi he
 That is to edit the deeds efficiently
 iskaa arth he, is prakaar karm karnaa ki vah bandhan na utpann kar sake
 Now the question is which karma creates bond and which does not? According to the Gita, the deeds which go to God in a spiritless way do not create bondage
 ve moksharup parampad kii prapti main sahaayak hote hai
 In this way, doing deeds for God, devoid of karmaphal and attachment, is actually karmayoga and by following it, a person gets birth and loss
 gita ke anusaar karmon se sanyas lene athwa unka parityag karne kii apeksha karmyog adhik shreyaskar he
 a person does not achieve accomplishment or supreme wealth by simply renouncing karma
 manushya ek kshan bhi karm kiye bina nahin rahata
 All the ignorant beings, Sattva, Raja and Tama arising out of nature, are controlled and controlled by these three qualities, and are instilled in deeds
 manushya yadi bahya drushti se karm na bhi kare or vishyon main lipt na ho to bhi vah unka man se chintan karata he
 This type of man is said to be foolish and misbehaving
 karm karnaa manushya ke liye anivaary he
 Without him, even sustaining the body is not possible
 bhagwaan krishna swayan kehete hai ki teenon lokon main unka koi bhi kartavya nahin he
 They do not have to receive any unclaimed item
 phir bhi ve karm main sanlagn rahete hai
 If they do not do the work, then the humans will also become inactive by following their path
 isse loksthiti ke liye kiye janevaale karmon kaa abhaav ho jayega jiske falswaroop sari praja nasht ho jaaegi
 That is why even a self-knowledgeable man, who has been freed from the bondage of nature, should always keep working
 agyani manushya jis prakaar falprapti kii aakanksha se karm karata he usee prakaar atmagyaani ko loksangrah ke liye aasaktirahit hokar karm karnaa chahie

 This time Yash gives Nandita an apartment on the occasion of her birthday, they start a new life and the two indulge in love, after some time Nandita is pregnant
 ek shaam, nandita kaa saamana prithvi naam ke, ek behad aakankshi artist se hota he jo apni masterpis kii khoj main us tak pahunchataa he
 Prithvi tells him that 4 months ago he made a sketching of a girl, who was actually Nandita
 vah us painting ko bhi dikhaata he jisamen uski kalai katane par leti padi he
 He warns Nandita to be alert to any danger
 magar prithvi kii baat ko ansuni kar chuki, nandita ko bathroom main achaanak hi koi pret uski kalai kaat detaa he
 Prithvi saves her and enforces her in the hospital
 yash aspataal pahunchataa he or uske garbh ko jaanane kii koshish karata he or bataati he ki atyadhik raktasrav se ab uskaa garbhpaat mushkil he
 She complains to Yash about the Earth, and Yash arrests her, but he is soon left

 At the same time, the inspector investigating this suicide is also vulnerable to its bad effects
 udhar vaapis apane ghar main, prithvi ek or tasviir banaata he jisamen nandita par bheed hamalaa karti he
 He goes to the fashion show where Nandita performs, and is attacked by a ghost and attacks a spiritual master present on the show
 tab vah unheen panktiyon ko doharaati hui use kahati he ki, " tu ashuddh he, andar se sad chukaa he"
 Prithvi rushes to save her, but is stopped by the guards present there
 nandita ko us guru ji or darshakon se dur hataaya jaataa he
 After some time, an interview of Guru ji is shown on TV, which speaks of a phantom dominating Nandita
 vahiin sabakuch jaanane par, yash saarvajanik taur par sabase maafee maangata he, or bataata he asal main vah maansik samasyaon se pareshaan he
 On the other hand, after the Earth is released by the guards, Nandita again sees the phantom in the bathroom, which is again written in the same lines in the mirror
 vah prithvi se madad maangane jaati he, magar vahi usase inkaar karata he, yah tasviir dikhaate hue jisamen vah khud ko phaansi laga chuki he or uske najadik hi vahi samaan panktiyaan likhi hui he
 Then he also shows a clipping of the news in which the priest and David Cooper died, and the same lines were written behind them
 nandita use shukriya kahati he or yash kii bulaai party main shirkat karne pahunchati he
 But even after reaching there, the ghost dominates him and, he injures himself and starts bleeding
 isi bich, prithvi uski madad kii khatir taiyaar hota he nandita kii us manahuus bhavishya kii tasviir ko jalaakar, is baat kaa dhotik ki vah uski jaan bachaakar rahe
 He sees Nandita running away from the party, bloodied, and then he falls behind her
 aakhir main vah use ek jhuggi ilaake main khoj nikaalata he, jahaan vah unheen panktiyon ko duhratehue likh rahi thi
 Prithvi tries to stop her but he realizes that Nandita is dominated by Phantom
 nandita khudkhushi kii bharsak koshish karti he magar aisa karne se prithvi use roak letaa he
 Yash then rushes and reaches Nandita in the arms of the earth
 yash tab nandita kii madad karne ko raji hota par is shart par ki vah prithvi kaa saath chhod de, magar vah uski madad lene se manaa kar detii he or prithvi ke saath chalane kaa nishchay karti he taaki kalindi jaakar is sach ko dhund sake
 That evening, Prithvi and Nandita spend the night in the guest house and leave the next morning
 pure din ke safar ke baad vah log kalindi pahonchte hai or us pujari kii bivi se milte he jo bataati he ki uskaa pati ne khud aise kukarm main shaamil rahaa tha or use isaki maut par hairaani tak nahin, uske shaayad marane kii yahi vajah hogi ki usne dharm ke naam par kai maasoom logon ke saath khilwaad karne kaa aparaadh kiya hoga
 Then they decide to go to the police inspector's house, where they find that Puri has gone completely mad and not worthy of stopping him from committing suicide
 aashaatheet saboot nahin milane par nandita va prithvi usee shaam vaapis lautate hai
 On the way, Nandita is seen committing suicide from the earth due to not being able to bear the consequences
 prithvi use aashwast karata he ki ve log milakar sachai dhund nikaalenge
 Just then, his car is stopped by a herd of cattle and a disturbed bull overturns his car
 nandita car se nikal padati he, prithvi nikalne kii purajor koshish karata he
 Then the same ghost leads him to the forest where he is again attacked in the sky
 phir use kai log pedo par latake dikhaai padate hai
 After this she finds herself at a well and sees that someone is standing nearby, she moves towards him
 isi main vah kuen main kud jaati he, prithvi bhi uske peeche chalaang lagaataa he or pakad letaa he
 Knowing that the wall of the well is like a steep rock
 vahiin kuen ke bheetar, nandita jaan jaati he ki yah prithvi ke pita, vir pratap singh, hi he jo usapar haaavee hote rahe hai
 It all started when he came to know about the toxic waste discharged from the chemical factory of Kalindi into the river and where thousands of devotees arrive every year to bathe in the lake in this holy ritual
 ve david kupar ke khilaaf shikaayat daayar karne thane bhi jate hai magar vahi pulicekarmi or mandir pujari kisi bhi karrwai naa karne kii dhamkee dete he,anyathaa pavitra anushthan main vyavdhaan daalkar vah apni jindagi khud khatre main daal degaa
 In response, he tells them, "you are impure, rotten inside"
 vir pratap yah sari sachai sabake saamne khulaasa karne kii koshish karte hai, magar jald hi pujari ke mangaaye lathait use peet-petakar adhamra kar dete hai, par kisi tarah jaan bachaane ke chakkar main vah kuen main gir padate he
 After dying, he takes revenge by becoming Ruh
 is tarah vah david kupar, or uskaa saath dene vaale pulicekarmi va pujari kii bhi usee tarah jane le lete hai
 Earth finally knows this truth, but it cannot understand why Nandita is getting involved in this matter
 yahaan subah hote hi yash apane laav-lashkar ke saath nandita ko lene pahunch jaataa he
 The same evening, Prithvi sees another frightening dream of Nandita, he immediately makes a picture of her on the floor where it was reported that she is to be killed today
 vahiin yah sachai maaloom pad jaati he ki yash ke yahaan vir pratap singh kii maut sabhi pramaan hai, magar usne vah saboot apane sho kaa prayojan dhan ke liye david ko hi de die
 Nandita tries to run away to find that evidence but before Yash would shoot at her, Prithvi reaches there and saves Nandita
 magar pasa palat jaataa he, yash chaalaaki se prithvi ko jakhmi kar maar daalata
 At the end, Yash gets punished and killed by Yash, revealing the soul of Veer Pratap
 iske saath hi, vir pratap ke guzarate hi prithvi ke ghaav thik hote hai
 At the same time, the chemical factory is also closed with the ritual festival on the evidence of all the murders and the poisoning of Kalindi's lake
 prithvi or nandita nae sire se jindagi shuru karte he
