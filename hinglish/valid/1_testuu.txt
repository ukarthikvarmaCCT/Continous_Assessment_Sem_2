 There is no conditional treatment for liver cirrhosis so far, drugs can prevent its growth process, can prevent liver cells from getting damaged and the problems caused by this disease can be reduced
 Treatment for liver cirrhosis depends on its cause: - If drinking alcohol causes cirrhosis, first stop drinking alcohol, this will slow the pace of disease progression
 Doctors of cirrhosis patients with c or c must first protect the liver cells from damage by giving antiviral drugs
 If a patient is suffering from autoimmune disease or Wilson disease, or cirrhosis from hemochromatosis, their treatment will be different
 Symptoms of cirrhosis can be controlled through medication
 Edema or ascites can be treated by controlling the salt in the diet
 This drug, known as Duraitis, is used to remove excess fluid during edema
 Initial treatment is given to patients who are affected by mental function due to this disease with the help of medicine and diet
 The use of laxatives, called lactulose, causes rapid absorption of toxins from the intestines

 Timurid Siphasalar Babur, a Turkish Muslim who came from Fargana Wadi, established the Mughal dynasty
 unhone uttari bharat ke kuch hisson par hamalaa kiya or dilli ke shaasha ibrahim shah lodhi ko 1526 main panipat ke pehle yuddh main haraaya
 The Mughal Empire replaced the Sultan of Delhi as the rulers of northern India
 samay ke saath, umer dwaara sthapit rajya ne dilli ke sultan kii seemaa ko paar kiya, antat bharat kaa ek bada hissaa gheraa or samrajya kii padavi kamai
 Within a brief kingship during the reign of Babur's son Humayun, he saw the rise of the Afghan Suri dynasty under Sher Shah Suri, an able and skilled ruler in his own right
 haalaanki, sher shah kii asamyik mrityu or unke uttaradhikariyon kii sainya aakshamata ne 1555 main humayun ko apni gaddi hasil karne ke liye sakasham kiya
 However, Humayun died a few months later and his 13-year-old son Akbar succeeded him
 mogul vistaar kaa sabase bada bhaag akbar ke shasankaal ke dauraan nipun hua
 The empire was retained as the dominant power for the next hundred years by the successors of the present Indian subcontinent, Jahangir, Shahjahan and Aurangzeb
 pehle chah samraat, jinhone donon "vidhi sammat" or "rail" shaktiyon kaa anand liya, unhen aamtaur par sirf ek hi naam se ullekh karte hai, ek sheershak jo prayek maharaj dwaara apane parigrahan par apanaai jaati thi
 The list is written in bold letters below the relevant title
 akbar ne katipay mahatvapurn nitiyon ko shuru kiya tha, jaise kii dharmik udaarvaad, samrajya ke maamalon main hinduon ko shaamil karnaa or raajnneetik gathbandhan / hindu rajput jati ke saath shaadi, jo ki unke vaataavaran ke liye abhinav the
 He also adopted some of Sher Shah Suri's policies, such as dividing the empire into governments under his administration
 in nitiyon ne nihsandeh shakti banaae rakhane main or samrajya kii sthirataa main madad kii thi, inako do taatkaalik uttaradhikariyon dwaara sangrakshit kiya gaya tha, lekin inhen aurangzeb ne tyaag diya, jisane ek niti apanaai jisamen dharmik sahishnutaa kaa kam sthaan tha
 Apart from this, Aurangzeb tried to expand his scope in Deccan and South India almost throughout his career
 is udhyam ne samrajya ke sansadhano ko baha diya jisase maratha, punjab ke sikhon or hindu rajputon ke andar majboot pratirodh uttejit hua
 After the reign of Aurangzeb, the empire declined

 In the 18th century, this empire endured the plunder of raiders such as Nadir Shah of Persia and Ahmed Shah Abdali of Afghanistan, who repeatedly plundered the Mughal capital Delhi
 bharat main is samrajya ke kshetron ke adhikansh bhaag ko british ko milane se pehle marathaon ko parajeet kiya gaya tha
 In 1803, the blind and powerless Shah Alam II formally accepted the patronage of the British East India Company

 Nevertheless, after a few decades, the BEIC continued to rule in the territories under its control as nominal servants of the emperor and in his name, in 1827 this courtesy was also over

 Some important details about the Mughal emperors are tabulated below: akbar shah II The major contribution of the Mughals to the Indian subcontinent was their unique architecture
 mogul kaal ke dauraan muslim samraaton dwaara taj mahal sahit kai mahaan smarak banaae gaye the
 The Muslim Mughal dynasty built magnificent palaces, tombs, minarets and forts that today stand in Delhi, Dhaka, Agra, Jaipur, Lahore, Sheikhpura, India, Pakistan and many other cities of Bangladesh
 unke uttaradhikariyon ne, madhya asian desh ke kam yaadon ke saath jiske liye unhone intazaar kiya, upmahadweep kii samskruti kaa ek kam janibadaar drishy liya or kaaphi aatmasat bane
 He absorbed the traits and practice of many subcontinent
 bharat ke itihaas main dusron kii tulana main mogul kaal ne bhartiya, irani or madhya asia ke kalatmak, bauddhik or saahitiyik parampara kaa ek or adhik upyogi kaa sammishran dekha
 The Indian subcontinent was heavily influenced by both Hindu and Muslim traditions, culture and style
 ve upmahadweep ke samaajon or samskruti ke liye kai ullekhneey badlaav laae, jisamen shaamil hai: The remarkable flowering of art and architecture under the Mughals is due to several factors
 is samrajya ne kalatmak pratibha ke vikaas ke liye ek surakshit dhaancha pradaan kiya or is upmahadweep ke itihaas main adwitiya dhan or sansadhano ko badhaava diya
 The Mughal rulers themselves were exceptional patrons of art, whose intellectual ability and cultural outlook were expressed in the most sophisticated tastes
 haalaanki jis par unhone kabhi shashan kiya tha vah hindustaan ab pakistan, bharat or bangladesh main bant gaya he, par unka prabhaav aaj bhi vyapak rup se dekha ja saktaa he
 The tombs of the emperors are spread across India and Pakistan

 ayurveda vishwa kii pracheenatam chikitsa pranaaliyon main se ek he
 It is a mixture of science, art and philosophy
 ‘ayurveda’ naam kaa arth he, ‘jivan kaa gyaan’ or yahi sankshep main ayurveda kaa saar he
 The term "ayurveda" is made up of two words - "ayush" and "veda"
 , ahit aayu, sukh aayu, evam dukh aayu - inkaa varnan ho use ayurveda kehete hai
 ) ayurveda bhartiya ayurvigyaan he
 Medical science is the branch of science which is concerned with keeping the human body healthy, freeing or mitigating disease in case of disease and increasing age
 ayurveda vishwa main vidyaman vah sahitya he, jiske adhyayan pashchaat ham apane hi jivan style kaa vishleshan kar sakate he
 Adi Acharya of this scripture is considered as Ashwini Kumar who added the head of a goat to the torso of Daksha Prajapati
 ashvini kumaron se indra ne yah vidya praapt kii
 Indra taught Dhanvantari
 kaashi ke raja divodas dhanvantari ke avatar kahe gaye hai
 Sushruta went to read Ayurveda by visiting her
 atri or bharadwaj bhi is shaastra ke pravartak maane jate hai
 The Acharyas of the Ayur Veda are - Ashvinikumar, Dhanvantari, Divodas, Nakula, Sahadeva, Arki, Chyavan, Janaka, Mercury, Javal, Jajali, Pal, Karath, Agastya, Atri and his six disciples, Sushruta and Charak
 brahma ne ayurveda ko aath bhaagon main baantkar prayek bhaag kaa naam 'tantra' rakhaa 
 These eight parts are the following: is ashtang ayurveda ke antargat dehatatva, sharir vigyaan, shastravidya, bheshaj or dravya gun tatva, chikitsa tatva or dhatri vidya bhi he 
 Apart from this, laws of modern medical systems like analogous medicine, anti-medical and hydro-medicine etc
 are also found in it
 puratatvvettaon ke anusaar sansar kii pracheenatam pustak rugveda he
 Various scholars consider it to have been composed from 3,000 to 50,000 years before Christ
 is samhita main bhi ayurveda ke atimahatva ke siddhanth yatra-tatra vikeern he
 Valid texts like Charak, Sushruta, Kashyap etc
 consider Ayurveda as the Upveda of Atharvaveda
 isse ayurveda kii pracheenta siddh hoti he
 Therefore, we can say that the creation of Ayurveda dates back to 3,000 to 50,000 years BC, ie, with or around the origin of creation
 ayurveda ke aitihaasik gyaan ke sandarbh main sarvapratham gyaan kaa ullekh, charak mat ke anusaar mrityulok main ayurveda ke avataran ke saath- agnivesh kaa namollekh he
 First Prajapati from Brahma, Ashwini Kumar from Prajapati, Indra from him and Bhardwaj from Indra studied Ayurveda
 chyavan rishi kaa kaarykaal bhi ashvini kumaron kaa samakaleen mana gaya he
 Rishi Chyavan has a very important contribution in the development of Ayurveda
 phir bharadwaj ne ayurveda ke prabhaav se deergh sukhi or aarogy jivan praapt kar anya rishiyon main uskaa prachaar kiya
 Subsequently Punarvasu Atreya preached Ayurveda to six disciples named Agnivesh, Bhel, Jatu, Parashar, Harit and Ksharpani
 in chah shishyon main sabase adhik budhimaan agnivesh ne sarvapratham ek samhita kaa nirmaan kiya- agnivesh tantra kaa jiskaa pratisanskaar baad main charak ne kiya or uskaa naam charakasamhita padaa, jo ayurveda kaa aadhaar stambh he
 According to Sushruta, Sasruta, along with other Maharishrias, came to Lord Dhanvantari, who appeared in the form of Kashiraj Divodas, and applied to him to study Ayurveda
 us samay bhagwaan dhanvantari ne un logon ko upadesh karte hue kaha ki sarvapratham swayan brahma ne sristi utpaadan purv hi atharvaveda ke upved ayurveda ko ek sahasr adhyay- shat sahasr shlokon main prakashit kiya or punah manushya ko alpamedhaavi samajhakar ise aath angon main vibhakt kar diya
 In this way, Dhanvantari has also considered the publication of Ayurveda as propounded by Brahmadev itself
 punah bhagwaan dhanvantari ne kaha ki brahma se daksh prajapati, unase ashvinikumar dway tathaa unase indra ne ayurveda kaa adhyayan kiya
 The history of Ayurveda is mainly divided into three parts - samhitakaal kaa samay 5veen shatee i
pus
 se 6veen shatee tak mana jaataa he
 This period was the era of the original creations of Ayurveda
 is samay aacharyo ne apni pratibha tathaa anubhav ke bal par bhinn-bhinn angon ke vishay main apane pandityapurna granthon kaa pranayan kiya
 The era of the rise of the Trimuni - Charak, Sushruta and Vagbhata of Ayurveda is also the Samhidakala
 charak samhita granth ke madhyam se kaaychikitsa ke kshetra main adbhut safalataa is kaal kii ek pramukh visheshta he
 Its time has been considered from 7th century to 15th century and this period is known for criticisms and commentators
 is kaal main samhitakaal kii rachanaaon ke upar tikaakaron ne praudh or swasth vyakhyaayen nirupit kin
 The Sushruta Samhita Tika of Acharya Dalhan of this time is considered very important in Ayurveda world
 shodh granth ‘rasratnasamucchy’ bhi isi kaal kii rachana he, jise acharya vagbhat ne charak or sushrut samhita or anek rasshastragyon kii rachana ko aadhaar banaakar likhaa he
 The time of this period is considered from the 14th century to the modern period
 yah kaal vishisht vishyon par granthon kii rachanaaon kaa kaal rahaa he
 The texts like Madhavnidan, Jawardarpan etc
 were also written in this period
 chikitsa ke vibhinn prarupon par bhi is kaal main vishesh dhyaan diya gaya, jo ki vartmaan main bhi praasangik he
 During this period, Ayurveda is being expanded and used on a very large scale
 spasht he ki ayurveda kii pracheenta vedon ke kaal se hi siddh he
 Social medicine is considered a new ideology in modern medicine, but it is not a new ideology but it is just a repetition of it, which has been mentioned in Ayurveda even before 2500 years
 ayurveda kaa uddeshy hi swasth praani ke swasthya kii raksha tathaa rogi kii rog se raksha he
 
 ayurveda ke do uddeshy hai : For this, considering the country, time etc
 suited to your body and nature, regular dieting, gestures, exercise, defecation, bathing, sleeping, awakening, etc
, to follow scriptural routines, nighttime and seasonal habits useful for household life, through hazardous tasks Avoiding, doing every task judiciously, keeping the mind and senses under control, according to the circumstances of the country, time, etc
 Doing some work, not stopping the present velocities of feces, urine etc
, avoiding jealousy, malice, greed, ego etc
, purification of the body from time to time by using vomit, purgation etc
 to remove accumulated defects in the body
 Doing, observing virtue and properly following the teachings of medical practitioners in epidemics arising out of the effects of contaminated air, water, country and time, saving clean and clear water, air, food etc
 Do not do it and motivate others too, these are the means of health protection
 iske liye prayek rog ke These three are called the 'triskandha' of Ayurveda
 iskaa vistrut vivechan ayurveda granthon main kiya gaya he
 Only a brief introduction will be given here
 kintu iske purv aayu ke prayek sanghatak kaa sankshipt parichay aavashyak he, kyonki sanghatakon ke gyaan ke bina unamem honevaale vikaron ko jaananaa sambhav na hoga
 The meaning of Ayurveda is very broad according to the interpretation of the ancient masters and the meanings of these two words 'ayu' and 'veda'
 ayurveda ke aacharyon ne 'sharir, indriya, man tathaa aatma ke sanyog' ko aayu kaha he
 That is, as long as there are many differences of age according to these four assets or misfortune, but in essence it is considered to be of four types: sukhaayu : kisi prakaar ke shiririk yaa maansik vikaas se rahit hote hue, gyaan, vigyaan, bal, paurush, dhanri dhaany, yash, parijan aadi sadhano se samrudh vyakti ko "sukhaayu' kehete hai
 Dukhayu: On the contrary, despite having all the means, a person suffering from physical or mental illness or without being sick, a person without means or health and resources, is called "grief"
 hitayu : swasthya or sadhano se sampann hote hue yaa unamem kuch kami hone par bhi jo vyakti vivek, sadachaar, sushiltaa, udaartaa, satya, ahimsa, shanti, paroapkaar aadi aadi gunon se yukt hote hai or samaaj tathaa lok ke kalyaan main nirat rahete hai unhen hitayu kehete hai
 Ahitayu: On the contrary, those who are imprudent, misdemeanor, cruelty, selfishness, arrogance, atrocities, etc
, have bad qualities and are a curse for society and the people
 is prakaar hit, ahit, sukh or du:kha, aayu ke ye chaar bhed hai
 Similarly, according to Kaalpramana, longevity, middle age and short age, in essence these are three distinctions
 vaise in teenon main bhi anek bhedon kii kalpana kii ja sakati he
 The word 'veda' also has the meaning of power, profit, speed, thought, attainment and knowledge, and the age Veda is called Ayurveda
 arthath jis shaastra main aayu ke swaroop, aayu ke vividh bhed, aayu ke liye hitkaarak or apramaan tathaa unke gyaan ke sadhano kaa evam aayu ke upadanbhoot sharir, indriya, man or aatma, inamen sabhi yaa kisi ek ke vikaas ke saath hit, sukh or deergh aayu kii prapti ke sadhano kaa tathaa inke baadhak vishyon ke niraakaran ke upayon kaa vivchen ho use ayurveda kehete hai
 But nowadays Ayurveda "ancient Indian medical system" is used in this narrow sense
 samast cheshtaaon, indriyon, man ore aatma ke aadharbhoot paanchabhautik pind ko 'sharir' kehete hai
 The human body has six organs in its gross form; Two arms, two legs, head and cervix, and one interstitial
 in angon ke avyavon ko pratyang kehete hai- According to Ayurveda, there are 300 bones in the whole body, which nowadays are considered to be two hundred and six only due to the number of spheres and there are 200 joints, muscles 900, veins 700, arteries 24 and their branches 200, muscles 500 and subtle sources 30,956
 ayurveda ke anusaar sharir main ras, rakt, maance, med, asthi, majja or shukr, ye saat dhaatuen hai
 As a result, they are also decayed due to their use in various functions, but the various substances we take as food and drink not only compensate for this damage, but also confirm the metals
 aaharroop main liya hua padaarth pachakagni, bhutagni or vibhinn dhatvanignyon dwaara paripakv hokar anek parivartanon ke baad purvokt dhaatuon ke rup main parinat hokar in dhaatuon kaa poshan karata he
 In this digestion, the essence part of the diet is nourished by the juices and from the remaining part of the kitta, feces and urine are formed
 yah ras hriday se hota hua shiraaon dwaara saare sharir main pahunchakar prayek dhaatu or ang ko poshan pradaan karata he
 Blood is also nourished by the essence of the metal, juice etc
 on digestion from the metals, and the nourishment of the body is produced from the kitta part, like phlegm from the juice; Blood bile; Stool coming out of the nose through the flesh, ears and eyes; Fattening from sweat; Mud from the bone to the hair and follicle and from the marrow are formed in the form of mud
 shukr main koi mel nahin hota, uske saare bhaag se oj kii utpatti hoti he
 Many micronutrients are also produced from these metallic metals, such as milk from juice, tendons and veins from blood, fat from flesh, skin and its six or seven levels, fattening from muscles, teeth from bone, hair from marrow and oozes from Venus
 Namely substrates are produced
 ye dhaatuen or upadhaatuen vibhinn avyavon main vibhinn roopon main sthit hokar sharir kii vibhinn kriyaaon main upyogi hoti hai
 As long as they remain in the proper quantity and form and their action remains natural, the body remains healthy and when they are in low or high and distorted form, disease is produced in the body
 pracheen darshanik sinddhant ke anusaar sansar ke sabhi sthool padaarth prithvi, jal, tej, vaayu or akaash in paanch mahabhuton ke sanyukt hone se banate hai
 They have different forms due to the difference in their proportions
 isi prakaar sharir ke samast dhaatu, upadhatu or mel paanchabhautik hai
 As a result, all the components of the body and hence the whole body are five physical
 ye sabhi achetan hai
 When there is a coincidence of the soul in them, then there is also consciousness in their consciousness
 uchit paristhiti main shuddh raj or shuddh veery kaa sanyog hone or usamen aatma kaa sanchaar hone se mata ke garbhashay main sharir kaa aarambh hota he
 This is called womb
 mata ke aaharajanit rakt se aparaa or garbhanaadi ke dwaara, jo naabhi se lagi rahati he, garbh poshan praapt karata he
 It gets nourishment by being immersed in the contraceptive and also gets nourishment in the first month and cubes in the second month? In the third month, the development of the organ afferent begins
 chauthe maas main usamen adhik sthirataa aa jaati he tathaa garbh ke lakshan mata main spasht rup se dikhaai padane lagate hai
 In this way, it develops progressively in the mother's body, when the whole organ, consisting of elements and components, often comes out of the Kukshi in the ninth month and takes birth as a new creature
 sharir main prayek ang yaa kisi bhi avyav kaa nirmaan uddeshivishesh se hi hota he, arthath prayek avyav ke dwaara vishisht kaaryon kii siddhi hoti he, jaise haath se pakadana, pair se chalanaa, mukh se khaanaa, daant se chabana aadi
 There are also some components that perform many functions and there are some that carry out a specific function
 jinase kaarivishesh hi hota he unamem us kaary ke liye shaktisampann ek vishisht sookshm rachana hoti he
 This is called sense
 shabd, sparsh, rup, ras or gandh in bahya vishyon kaa gyaan praapt karne ke liye krmanusaar kaan, twachaa, netra, jihva or nasika ye avyav indriashray avyav kehalaate hai or inamen sthit vishisht shaktisampann sookshm vastu ko indriya kehete hai
 These are five respectively in sookshm avyavon main panchmahabhuton main se us mahabhoot kii visheshta rahati he jiske shabd aadi vishisht gun hai; jaise shabd ke liye shroatra indriya main akaash, sparsh ke liye tvak indriya main vaayu, rup ke liye chakshu indriya main tej, ras ke liye rasanendriya main jal or gandh ke liye ghranendriya main prithvi tatv
 These five senses are called Gyanendriyas
 inke atirikt vishisht kaarysampadan ke liye paanch camendriyaan bhi hoti hai, jaise gaman ke liye pair, grahan ke liye haath, bolne ke liye jihva, malatyag ke liye guda or mutratyag tathaa santanotpaadan ke liye shishn 
 Like philosophers, Ayurveda considers the senses not egoistic, but physical
 in indriyon kii apane kaaryon man kii prerana se hi pravriti hoti he
 It remains inactive when there is no contact with the mind
 prayek praani ke sharir main atyant sookshm or keval ek man hota he
 It is extremely quick and is the controller of every sense
 kintu yah swayan bhi aatma ke sampark ke bina achetan hone se niskriy rahata he
 In spite of all these three natural qualities, Sattva, Raja and Tama in the mind of each person, one of them usually prevails and accordingly the person is Satvik, Rajas or Tamas, but from time to time, diet, ethics and Due to the influence of circumstances, other qualities also become dominant
 iskaa gyaan pravritiyon ke lakshanon dwaara hota he, yatha raag-dwesh-shunya yatharthadrashtaa man satvik, ragayukt, sachesht or chanchal man rajas or aalasy, dirghsutrata evam niskriyata aadi yukt man taamas hota he
 That is why Satvik mind is considered pure, sattva or natural and Raja and Tama are called its defects
 aatma se chetanta praapt kar prakritik yaa sadosh man apane gunon ke anusaar indriyon ko apane-apane vishyon main pravrutt karata he or usee ke anuroop shaareerik kaary hote hai
 The soul moves the senses and the senses through the mind, because the mind is its cause
 isiilie man kaa sampark jis indriya ke saath hota he usee ke dwaara gyaan hota he, duusare ke dwaara nahin
 Because the mind is subtle on one side, it is not possible to have contact with multiple senses simultaneously
 phir bhi uski gati itani teevr he ki vah ek ke baad duusari indriya ke sampark main shighrata se parivartit hota he, jisase hamen yahi gyaat hota he ki sabhi ke saath uskaa sampark he or sab kaary ek saath ho rahe hai, kintu vastav main aisa nahin hota
 The soul is panchabhumta and different from the mind, is conscious, formless and continual and is a witness form, because itself is devoid and passive
 iske sampark se sakriy kintu achetan man, indriyon or sharir main chetana kaa sanchaar hota he or ve sachesht hote hai
 There is no sign, form, color, shape etc
 in the soul, but without it the body remains inactive due to being unconscious and is called dead and its contact brings consciousness to it, then it is called alive and has many natural actions
 Looks like; Such as shortness of breath, enlarging from small and severed wounds etc
, opening and closing of eyelids, signs of life, movement of mind, knowledge from one sense to another effect, different senses and elements tend to different functions
 To take and hold subjects, to reach from one place to another in the dream, to experience the object seen with one eye with the other eye
 ichha, dwesh, sukh, du:kha, praytn, dhairya, buddhi, samaran shakti, ahankaar aadi sharir main aatma ke hone par hi hote hai; atmarahit mrit sharir main nahin hote
 Therefore, these are called the symptoms of the soul, that is, the soul can be estimated only from the aforesaid symptoms
 maansik kalpana ke atirikt kisi duusari indriya se uskaa pratyaksh karnaa sambhav nahin he
 This soul, despite being perpetual, formless and comprehensive, acts as a result of the predetermined auspicious or inauspicious deeds in the vagina or in the body, the way the mind and senses and subjects come into contact
 uttarottar ashubh kaaryon ke karne se uttarottar adhogati hoti he tathaa shubh karmon ke dwaara uttarottar unnati hone se, man ke raag-dwesh-hin hone par, moksh kii prapti hoti he
 It is clear from this description that the soul is immaterial, but there can be distortions in the mind, senses and body, and because of these three being mutual, the disorder of one can affect the other
 at: inhen prakrutistha rakhana yaa vikrut hone par prakruti main laana yaa swasth karnaa paramaavashyak he
 This leads to long happiness and Hitayu, which respectively helps the soul to get rid of its sole, but also severe, birth death and diseases like bhavabandhan, which is said to be a natural medicine in Ayurveda
 charak ne sankshep main rog or aarogy kaa lakshan yah likhaa he- Sushruta has given the detail of a healthy person in detail- iske vipareet lakshan hon to aswasth samajhnaa chahie
 The disease is also called pathology or disorder
 at: sharir, indriya or man ke prakritik rup yaa kriya main vikruti hona rog he
 The synonym for the cause of the disease is 'diagnosis'
 jab kisi aahaar yaa vihaar se sharir par rog pradurbhaav dikhalaae tab use nidaan kehete hai
 All the things in the world have some kind of definite effect on the body, senses and mind from the person or tradition and due to improper or adverse effects, they cause disorder and cause diseases
 in sabakaa vistrut vivechan kathin he, at: sankshep main inhen teen virgon main baant diya gaya he : Prajnapraadh: Consuming a subject without knowing or knowing an inappropriate item without considering loss of profit due to indiscretion, impatience and prior experience and neglect of reality
 isi ko duusare or spasht shabdon main karm kaa hin, mithyaa or ati yoga bhi kehete hai
 Asmatyendriyarthsayog: Incidental coincidence of the senses with their own forms, etc
, causes the disorder of the senses, body and mind; As if not to look with eyes, to see very bright objects and to see too much and to see very subtle, narrow, very distant and terrible, ungodly, and disordered things
 ye chakshurindriya or uske aashray netron ke saath man or sharir main bhi vikaar utpann karte hai
 This is also called misuse of meaning in other words
 greeshm, varsha, sheet aadi rituon tathaa balya, yuva or vriddhavasthaon kaa bhi sharir aadi par prabhaav padataa hi he, kintu inke hin, mithyaa or atiyog kaa prabhaav vishesh rup se hanikar hota he
 Variations of the aforesaid causes also lead to other distinctions; As prakarantar se inke anya do bhed hote hai- All these reasons have three types of effects on the body: doshapracope- anek kaarnon se sharir ke upadanbhoot akaash aadi paanch tatwon main se kisi ek yaa anek main parivartan hokar unke swaabhaavik anupaat main antar aa janaa anivaary he
 Keeping this in mind, Ayurveda has divided these disorders into vata, pitta and phlegm
 panchmahabhoot evam tridosh kaa alag se vivechan hi uchit he, kintu sankshep main yah samajhnaa chahie ki sansar ke jitne bhi moort padaarth hai ve sab akaash, vaayu, tej, jal or prithvi in paanch tatwon se bane hai
 These earth etc
 are not the ones that we get to see in the gross world every day
 ye pichley sab to purvokt paanchon tatwon ke sanyog se utpann paanchabhautik hai
 Elements that have a plurality in objects are described by the same names
 usee prakaar hamaare sharir kii dhaatuon main yaa unke sanghatakon main jis tatv kii bahulata rahati he ve usee shrenee ke gine jate hai
 Of these five, the sky is formless and the earth is the most gross and the shelter of all
 jo kuch bhi vikaas yaa parivartan hote hai unka prabhaav isi par spasht rup se padataa he
 The remaining three are capable of causing all kinds of changes or disorders
 at: teenon kii prachurtaa ke aadhaar par, vibhinn dhaatuon evam unke sanghatakon ko vaat, pitt or kaph kii sangya di gai he
 In general, these three metals also contaminate other metals when they are deformed due to their nutritional value
 at: dosha tathaa mel rup hone se mel kehalaati hai
 There is a deficiency or excess of these three due to any reason in the disease, which is called defect
 dhatudushan- kuch padaarth yaa kaaran aise hote hai jo kisi vishisht dhaatu yaa avyav main hi vikaar karte hai
 They do not affect the whole body
 inhen dhatupradooshak kehete hai
 Aphrodisiac- Those substances which cause special disorder in a particular metal or organ, despite incurring the vata etc
 doshas all over the body, are called amphibia
 kintu in teenon main jo parivartan hote hai ve vaat, pitt yaa kaph in teenon main se kisi ek, do yaa teenon main hi vikaar utpann karte hai
 Therefore, these three doshas are the main body causes, because the changes in their natural proportions also cause distortion in the metals of the body
 rachana main vikaar hone se kriya main bhi vikaar hona swaabhaavik he
 Symptoms like diarrhea, rashes etc
 arise as a result of this unnatural design and action and only a group of these symptoms is called disease
 is prakaar jin padaarthon ke prabhaav se vaat aadi dosha main vikrutiyaan hoti hai tathaa ve vaataadi dosha, jo shaareerik dhaatuon ko vikrut karte hai, donon hi hetu yaa nidaan kehalaate hai
 Ultimately, it is necessary to consider two other important distinctions: purvokt kaarnon se utpann vikaron kii pahchaan jin sadhano dwaara hoti he unhen ling kehete hai
 It has four distinctions: preform, form, attainment and upanayana
 purvarup- kisi rog ke vyakt hone ke purv sharir ke bheetar hui atyalp yaa aarambhik vikruti ke kaaran jo lakshan utpann hokar kisi rogvishesh kii utpatti kii sambhaavna prakat karte hai unhen purvarup kehete hai
 Roop - The symptoms that give a clear introduction to disease or pathology are called Roop
 samprapti : kis kaaran se koun sa dosha swatantra rup main yaa paratantr rup main, akele yaa duusare ke saath, kitne ansh main or kitni maatra main prakupit hokar, kis dhaatu yaa kis ang main, kis-kis swaroop kaa vikaar utpann karata he, iske nirdhaaran ko samprapti kehete hai
 This has important utility in medicine
 vastut: in parivartanon se hi jvaradi rup main rog utpann hote hai, at: inhen hi vastav main rog bhi kaha ja saktaa he or inhen parivartanon ko dhyaan main rakhkar kii gai chikitsa bhi safal hoti he
 Excision and supplementation - when there is a doubt in deciding the actual causes or forms of diseases due to deficiency or narrowness etc
, then to overcome that doubt, one of the possible defects or disorders is to avoid appropriate disorders of dieting and medicine
 In the discussion of anabolism which benefits from using it, Ayurvadacharyo has given six types of dietary and drug experiments, giving the formula of 18 distinctions of Upasya
 Is described
 ye sutara itane mahatv ke hai ki inamen se ek-ek ke aadhaar par ek-ek chikitsapaddati kaa udai ho gaya he; jaise, Appendicitis and appendicitis also help in the identification of disease
 at: inako bhi pracheenon ne "ling' main hi gina he
 Proper and successful treatment is possible only for acquiring knowledge of disease through sex and sex
 hetu or lingon se rog kii pariksha hoti he, kintu inke samuchit gyaan ke liye rogi kii pariksha kerani chahie
 The means of patient examination are four - Optology, Direct, Estimate and Tip
 yogya adhikari, tap or gyaan se sampann hone ke kaaran, shastratatvon ko raag-dwesh-shunya buddhi se asandigdh or yatharth rup se jaanate or kehete hai
 Such scholars, research, experienced, non-partisan and real speakers are known to the great men and their words or writings are called optopadesh
 aaptjanon ne purna pariksha ke baad shastron kaa nirmaan kar unamem ek-ek ke sambandh main likhaa he ki amuk kaaran se, is dosha ke prakupit hone or is dhaatu ke dooshit hone tathaa is ang main ashrith hone se, amuk lakshanonvala amuk rog utpann hota he, usamen amuk-amuk parivartan hote hai tathaa uski chikitsa ke liye in aahaar vihaar or amuk aushadhiyon ke is prakaar upyog karne se tathaa chikitsa karne se shanti hoti he
 Therefore, after studying scripture from first qualified and experienced gurus, there is a tendency for disease, gender and medicine
 shaastravachanon ke anusaar hi lakshanon kii pariksha pratyaksh, anumaan or yukti se kii jaati he
 Psychologically, the senses are said to experience subjects directly
 iske dwaara rogi ke sharir ke ang pratyang main honevaale vibhinn shabdon kii pariksha kar unke swaabhaavik yaa aswabhaavik hone kaa gyaan shrotrendriya dwaara karnaa chahie
 Knowledge of color, shape, length, width, etc
, and knowledge of shadows etc
 should be acquired by the eyes, knowledge of smells, olfactory and sensation of cold, hot, rough, balsamic and pulse, etc
 by the sensory
 rogi ke sharirgat ras kii pariksha swayan apni jeebh se karnaa uchit na hone ke kaaran, uske sharir yaa usase nikle swead, mutr, rakt, pus aadi main cheentee laganaa yaa na laganaa, mackhiyon kaa aana or na aana, coy yaa kute aadi dwaara khaanaa yaa na khaanaa, pratyaksh dekhakar unke swaroop kaa anumaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Knowledge gained through rational reasoning is inference
 jin vishyon kaa pratyaksh nahin ho saktaa yaa pratyaksh hone par bhi unke sambandh main andeh hota he vahaan anumaan dwaara pariksha kerani chahie; yatha, pachanshkti ke aadhaar par agnibal kaa, vyaayaam kii shakti ke aadhaar par shaareerik bal kaa, apane vishyon ko grahan karne yaa na karne se indriyon kii prakruti yaa vikruti kaa tathaa isi prakaar bhojan main ruchi, aruchi tathaa pyaas evam bhay, shok, krodh, ichha, dwesh aadi maansik bhaavon ke dwaara vibhinn shaareerik or maansik vishyon kaa anumaan karnaa chahie
 The aforesaid subunit is also a matter of conjecture
 iskaa arth he yojana
 Seeing the origin of a specific work from the community influence of many causes, what is imagined by the corresponding ideas is called yukti
 jaise khet, jal, jutai, beej or ritu ke sanyog se hi paudha ugta he
 Smoke is always associated with fire, that is, where there is smoke there will be fire
 isi ko vyaptigyaan bhi kehete hai or isi ke aadhaar par tark kar anumaan kiya jaataa he
 In this way, the diagnosis, form, form, acquisition and treatment of all these community considerations justifies the decision of the disease
 yojana kaa duusari drushti se bhi rogi kii pariksha main prayog kar sakate hai
 For example, if a subject is not easily admissible in any sense, it is also intrinsic in the device to accept that subject with the help of other mechanical devices
 purvokt lingon ke gyaan ke liye tathaa roganirnay ke saath saadhyataa yaa asaadhyataa ke bhi gyaan ke liye aptopadesh ke anusaar pratyaksh aadi parikshaon dwaara rogi ke saar, tatv, sahanan, pramaan, satmya, aaharshakti, vyaayaamashakti tathaa aayu ke atirikt varna, swar, gandh, ras or sparsh ye vishay, shroatra, chakshu, ghran, rasan or spashendriya, satv, bhakthi, shaich, sheel, aachaar, smriti, akruti, bal, glani, tandra, aarambh, guruta, laghutaa, sheetaltaa, ushnata, mriduta, kaathinya aadi gun, aahaar ke gun, pachan or maatra, upaay, rog or uske purvarup aadi kaa pramaan, updrav, chaaya, pratichhaya, swapn, rogi ko dekhne ko bulaane ke liye aae doot tathaa raste or rogi ke ghar main pravesh ke samay ke shakun or apshakun, grahyog aadi sabhi vishyon kaa prakruti tathaa vikruti kii drushti se vichaar karte hue pariksha kerani chahie
 Especially pulse, stool, urine, tongue, word, touch, eye and shape should be carefully examined
 ayurveda main naadee kii pariksha ati mahatv kaa vishay he
 Only by examining the pulse, the knowledge of the nature of diseases, etc
, along with defects and witchcraft, is attained by experienced physicians
 jin sadhano ke dwaara rogon ke karanbhoot dosha evam shaareerik vikrutiyon kaa shaman kiya jaataa he unhen aushadh kehete hai
 These are mainly of two types: wasteful and liquid
 adravyabhoot aushadh vah he jisamen kisi dravya kaa upyog nahin hota, jaise upwas, vishram, sona, jaagnaa, tahalnaa, vyaayaam aadi
 External substances used in the body by external or internal experiments are liquid medicine
 ye dravya sankshep main teen prakaar ke hote hai : Like the body, all these matter are also five physical, they also have the components which belong to the body
 at: sansar main koi bhi dravya aisa nahin he jiskaa kisi na kisi rup main kisi na kisi rog ke kisi na kisi avasthavishesh main aushadharup main prayog na kiya ja sake
 But before using them, knowledge of their natural properties, ritualistic properties, method and experiment is necessary
 inamen kuch dravya dosha kaa shaman karte hai, kuch dosha or dhaatu ko dooshit karte hai or kuch swasthvruth main, arthath dhaatusamya ko sthir rakhane main upyogi hote hai, inaki upyogita ke samuchit gyaan ke liye dravyon ke paanchabhautik sanghatakon main taratamya ke anusaar swaroop, guruta, laghutaa, rukshata, snigdhata aadi gun, ras, vapak, veery, prabhaav tathaa maatra kaa gyaan aavashyak hota he
 Not all matter is always useful in the body in its natural forms
 rog or rogi kii aavashyaktaa ke vichaar se sharir kii dhaatuon ke liye upyogi evam satmyakaran ke anukool banane ke liye; in dravyon ke swaabhaavik swaroop or gunon main parivartan ke liye, vibhinn bhautik evam rasinic sanskaron dwaara jo upaay kiye jate hai unhen "kalpana' kehete hai
 Such as Swaras, Kalk or Churna, Cold Booth, Booth, Infusion and Arishta, Oil, Ghrita, Avleh etc
 and refining of minerals, etc
 chikitsak, parichaayak, aushadh or rogi, ye chaaron milakar shaareerik dhaatuon kii samta ke uddeshy se jo kuch bhi upaay yaa kaary karte hai use chikitsa kehete hai
 It is of two types: preventive and prohibitive; Just as the natural defects and metals of the body are not dissimilar and the tradition of equilibrium should remain constant, the therapy done for this purpose is preventive and the actions or remedies which create symmetry in the disordered body metals are called prohibitive therapies
 pun: chikitsa teen prakaar kii hoti he : It is clearly mentioned in the Gita - Mind and human cause, Bandhamokshyo: 7 - If not only mental, but also in the treatment of many physical diseases, if a human being is motivated, then there is hopeless success
 isamen man ko ahit vishyon se rokna tathaa harshan, aashwaasan aadi upaay hai
 Many people have defeated serious diseases on the strength of their self-confidence
 atev ek safal chikitsak rogi ke aatmbal ko viksit karne kaa prayaas karata he
 In this, these measures are like devaradhan, chanting, havan, puja, recitation, vrat, and wearing of gem, mantra, yantra, gemstone and medicine, etc
, as a result of suppression of defects etc
 rog or rogi ke bal, swaroop, avasthaa, swasthya, satv, prakruti aadi ke anusaar upyukat aushadh kii uchit maatra, anukool kalpana aadi kaa vichaar kar prayukt karnaa
 There are also three main types of it: internal scouring, external scouring, and weapons
 iske bhi do mukhya prakaar hai : The remedies for excluding physical defects are called Shodhan, its five remedies, Virechan, Vasti, Anusana and Uttravasti, Shirovirechan and Raktamokshan, these are the five measures
 shaman-lakshanik chikitsa : vibhinn lakshanon ke anusaar dosha or vikaron ke shamanarth vishesh gunwali aushadhi kaa prayog, jaise jvaranashak, chhardighn, atisarhar, uddipak, pachak, hridy, kushtaghn, balya, vishaghn, kashar, shwasahar, dahprashamak, sheetaprashamak, mutral, mutravishodhak, shukrajanak, shukravishodhak, stanyajanak, swedal, raktasthapak, vednahar, sangyaasthaapak, vay:sthaapak, jeevaneey, brunhniya, lekhneey, medneey, rukshneey, snaheneey aadi dravyon kaa aavashyaktaanusaar uchit kalpana or maatra main prayog karnaa
 The following things should be kept in mind while using these medicines: jaise abhyang, snaan, lep, dhupan, swedan aadi
 In different stages, one or several of the following eight types of weapons have to be performed: inke atirikt utpaatan, kuttan, manthan, dahan aadi upshastrkarm bhi hote hai
 Preparation before the preamble is called premedication, such as the patient’s refinement, preparation, purification of instruments, weapons, and the necessary cotton, cloth, bandage, melted butter, oil, decoction, coat etc
 during and after the armament
 vaastavik shastrkarm ko pradhan karm kehete hai
 After shakarma, refinement, Rohan, planting, dermatization, achromatization, Romogenesis etc
 are the remedies
 shastrasadhay tathaa anya anek rogon main kshar yaa agnipryog ke dwaara bhi chikitsa kii ja sakati he
 Leech, horny, tubi, pruning and venation are used to extract blood
 man bhi aayu kaa upadan he
 When the mind of the aforesaid Raja and Tama are corrupted by these two doshas, deteriorating mental balance also has an effect on the senses and body
 sharir or indriyon ke swasth hone par bhi manodosh se manushya ke jivan main astavyastata aane se aayu kaa hraas hota he
 For his treatment, due to the formation of the mind, along with physical purification, etc
, knowledge, science, sobriety, psychomotor, healing, reassurance, etc
 should be treated
 man ko kshobhak aahaar-vihaar aadi se bachanaa chahie tathaa maanas-rog-visheshgyon se upachaar karana chahie
 The senses - they are considered physical in Ayurveda
 ye sharirashrith tathaa manoniyantrit hoti hai
 Therefore, their diseases are treated on the basis of body and mind
 aatma ko pehle hi nirvikaar bataaya gaya he
 We have a feeling of disorder in the governing soul of all these, if there are disorders in its means and basis
 kintu purvakrit ashubh karmon parinamswaroop aatma ko bhi vividh yoniyon main janmagrahan aadi bhavabandhanrupi rog se bachaane ke liye, iske pradhan upkaran man ko shuddh karne ke liye, satsangati, gyaan, vairaygy, dharamshastrachinthan, vrath, upwas aadi karnaa chahie
 With this and yama-niyam, etc
 Yoga is practiced, due to the creation of memory, salvation is attained through rituals
 ise naishthiki chikitsa kehete hai
 Because the world is duality, where there is happiness there is sorrow as well, so the ultimate happiness is only when duality is free and that is called salvation
 vistrut vivechan, vishesh chikitsa tathaa sugamawa aadi ke liye ayurveda ko aath bhaagon main vibhakt kiya gaya he : ye aath ang ye hai- kaaychikitsa, shalyatantra, shalakyatantra, comarbhrity, agadtantra, bhootvidya, rasayanatantr or vajikaran

 After this, along with all the other Vedas, it has been discussed prominently in the Vedic texts like Upanishads
 nirukt ke rachiyata yask ne dyusthaneey devataaon main surya ko pehle sthaan par rakhaa he
 In the last period of the later Vedic period, the human form of the sun began to be imagined

 kanheri guphaayen mumbai shahar ke pashchimi kshetra main based main borivali ke uttar main sthit hai
 They are located in the premises of Sanjay Gandhi National Park and 6 km from the main park
 And 7 km from Borivali station
 are far
 ye gufaaen buddha kala darshaati hai
 The word Kanheri derives from Krishnagiri i
e
 Kala Parvat
 inako bade bade besalt kii chattaanon se taraasha gaya he
 This Girimandir of Kanheri is a rock-cut Buddhist mountain located on the island of Salset, about 25 miles from Mumbai
 hinayan sampradaay kaa yah chaityamandir andhrasatta ke praaia: antim yugon main duusari shatee i
 ke ant main nirmit hua tha
 It is usually made in the tradition of Carle, its chaityal hall is similar to that, with it, couple figures are also placed on it
 donon main atanr maatr itnaa he ki kanheri kii kala utani pranavan or shaleen nahin jitani karli kii he
 Its cave is also smaller than Carle's cave
 phir, lagbhag ek tihaai choti yah gupha apurna bhi rah gai he
 It is clear from the sculptures of Buddha built on its outer walls that the Mahayana sect also had a later impact on it and after some time after the Hinayana worship, Buddhist monks severed it which joined again in the Gupta period, though This new relationship brought with it Mahayana worship, which is influenced by the statues of Buddha and the Bodhisattvas
 in murtiyon main buddha kii ek murti 25 foot unchi he
 The plan of the Chaityamandir of Kanheri is usually this - the streams flowing between the four-storey vanasampada, over which the rising mountain wall and the deep long cave of Kanheri cut into it
 baahar ek praangan nichi diwaar se ghira he jisapar murtiyan bani hai or jisase hokar ek sopanmarg chaityadwar tak jaataa he
 The gatekeepers are built on both the sides and the pillar from the rocky wall has become a tradition
 kuch stambh alankrita bhi hai
 The number of pillars is 34 and the entire cave is 86 feet in length, 40 feet in width and 50 feet in height
 stambhon ke upar kii nar-nari-murtiyon ko kuch logon ne nirmaataa danpati hone kaa bhi anumaan kiya he jo sambhavat: anumaan maatr hi he
 There is no evidence from which to consider him the creator of this chaitya
 kanheri kii gananaa pashchimi bharat ke pradhan buddha girimandiron main kii jaati he or uskaa vaastu apane dwaar, khidakiyon tathaa mehrabon ke saath karli kii shilpaparampara kaa anukaran karata he

 dwayadhari sankhya paddati keval do ankon ko kaam main lene vaali sthaneey maan sankhya paddati he
 In this, base 2 is taken to calculate the number
 chunki do sthiti vaale electranik get in sankhyaon ko badi saralata se nirupit kar dete hai, is kaaran computer ke hardware evam saftware main is paddati kaa bahutayat se prayog hota he
 There are mathematical ways to convert binary numbers to decimal numbers
 iske tahat kai ganitiya upkaran hai jinase dwayadhari sahit anya vidhiyon main jamaa, gata, guna, bhaag va anya ganitiya akalan hote hai
 While converting digits from binary numbers to decimals is complicated, it is relatively easy to transfer binaries to other methods
 bharat ke vidwaan pingal ne chhandon ke varnan main dwayadhari sankhya paddati kaa atyant budhimatapurvak prayog kiya he
 Thus Pingal is the first person to describe the binary number system
 dashamalav paddati maanviya upyog ke liye saral he, isaliye aarambhik rup yahi prachlit hui or baad main bhi jab gananaa ke kai tareeke saamne aae to dashamalav paddati ko pramukh sthaan mila tha
 However, dualists are also largely a natural method
 kai aadhyatmik paramparaon main, jaise pithagoras skool or pracheen bhartiya sant parampara main bhi iskaa prayog hota tha
 The dual system is thought to have originated from the sixth century BCE
 san 1854 main ganitagya jorge bul ne dwayadhari paddati par aadhaarit ek patr prakashit kiya tha
 With this, the foundation of Boolean algebra was lying
 san 1937 main claude shainan ne dwayadhari bijganit ke aadhaar par theory of circuit kii neenv rakhi thi
 In 1940, binary computing began with the Bull Labs complex number computer
 kisi dwayadhari sankhya ke maan kii gananaa nimnlikhit prakaar se karte hai- By adding 'something' to the front or back of the represented number in the binary system, it is clarified that the number is two-dimensional
 neeche likhe hue sabhi 'sanketon kaa samooh' sankhya 'chah sau sarasth ko nirupit kar rahe hai
 But the first one is the most common formulation
 bhram se bachaane ke 0 or 1 kaa prayog karke likhe gayi dwi-aadhari sankhyaon ke saath kuch or bhi laga diya jaataa he taaki uskaa aadhaar spasht rahe
 Thus, all the following representations represent the same number
 dwayadhari sankhyaon ko jab shabdon main uccharit karnaa padataa he to unhen ankashah padhate hai jisase dashamik sankhyaon se bhinnata samaj main aa sake
 For example, the binary number 100 would be pronounced 'one zero zero' and not 'one hundred'
 isse is sankhya kaa dwiadhari prakruti kaa pataa bhi chal jaataa he or 'shuddhta' bhi rahati he
 '100' is not one hundred, it is only four
 isaliye ise 'ek sau' pukarana galat he
 In the binary number system below, a count from zero to sixteen is given
 nongaminsong bhartiya rajya ke meghalaya ke east khaasi hills jile main ek janaganana shahar he
 According to the 2001 census of India, the population of Nongmongsong was 11,362
 isamen se purushon kii 52% or mahilaon kii jansankhya 48% thi
 Nongameinsong had an average literacy rate of 69%, higher than the national average of 59
5%
 purush sakshartaa 74% he, or mahila sakshartaa 64% he
 15% of Nongmisong's population is under 6 years of age
 nongamaisong ko purv main laalachand basii ke naam se shilong ke ek mohalle ke rup main janaa jaataa tha
 
 shilong shahar se nongamaisong jane hetu purvottar indira gandhi kshetreey swasthya evam chikitsa santhaan ko jane vaali saarvajanik vaahan bas se athwa taxi aadi se jaaya ja saktaa he
 
 
 Lothi Mata is the name of a goddess, whose temple is located at Bhitarwar in Madhya Pradesh
 kisi prachlit lokkatha ke anusaar narvar ke tatkaaleen raja se bedney samaaj kii ek nrutyaangna ne shart lagaai ki vah narvar kile se kile ke saamne vaali unchi pahari tak kachche dhaage par naachati hui ja sakati he
 The king imposed his full secret text on the condition
 raja ko chhot di gayi thi ki vah kisi bhi dhardaar hathiyaar se dhaage ko kaat saktaa he
 As the dancer danced, the king became anxious as he prepared to go to the other side
 bedney apan gantavy tak pahunchne hi vaali thi
 Then the king tried to cut the thread with a sharp weapon
 vah dhaagaa na kaat paaya
 He tried all the sharp weapons
 manyata he ki us bedney ne apni mantra shakti se sabhi hathiyaaron kii dhar band di thi
 They were thwarted
 kintu ek charmaakaar kaa aujaar juute jodne ke kunde main dale hone se ashuddh hone ke kaaran mantron ke prabhaav se batch gaya
 His edge could not be tied
 raja ne charmkaar kii us ranpi se dhaagaa kaat diya
 Bedney died by falling below the height of the fort
 jis jagah gir kar bedney kaa dehant hua, sambhawatah usee jagah aaj ek mandir bana hua he
 Which is called the temple of Lodhi Mata
 is ghatana ke pashchaat yah kahawat lodhi mata ke sandarbh main prachlit hui
 Narvar climbed neither bedney, no food cooked, no brick, no food, no drop or print
 aaj bhi lodhi mata ke darshan hetu yah sthaan prasiddh he
 People from all over the country come here to worship
 nrityaangnaa ke saath hue is chal ke kaaran aaj bhi bedia samaaj ke log narvar main naachne ke liye aate hai
 Many stories related to the history of Narwar are prevalent in the society
 itihaaskaar dow
 manoj maheshwari bataate hai ki, lodhi mata kii katha atyant pracheen he or janamanas main khub rachi basii he
 Aapadharma means religion adopted in times of crisis, religion adopted under special circumstances
 mahabharat ke shaanti parv isi naam se ek upparv he
 An interesting story about Aapadharma is in the Chandogya Upanishad
 yah katha 'ushasti kii katha'naam se jaani jaati he

baalkrishnan Konkuppakatil Gopinathan Balakrishnan, better known as KG Balakrishnan, was the 37th Chief Justice of India
 ye pehle malayalam mukhya nyaayadhish bane the
 Justice was born in the Pulaya Daridar family in Thalayolparambu, a town in Travancore which is presently Kottayam district in the state of Kerala
 satnam yaa 'satinaam' guru granth sahib main prayukt pradhan shabd he
 It is also in the Mool Mantra
 prithvi upree sataha par mote, madhyam or baarik carbonic tathaa acarbonic mishrit kanon ko mrudaa kehete hai
 The rock is usually found when the soil is removed from the top surface
 kabhi kabhi thodi gaharaai par hi chattan mil jaati he
 'soil Science' is a major branch of physical geography in which scientific study of soil formation, its characteristics and its distribution on the ground is done
 pruthvi kii upree sataha ke kanon ko hi soil kaha jaataa he Soil brought by the banks of rivers and by the flow of water, which is called 'cachar soil', does not get rock by digging
 vahaan neeche ke str main jal kaa strot miltaa he
 All soils originate from rock
 jahaan prakruti ne mitti main adhik her-pher nahin kiya or jalwaayu kaa prabhaav adhik nahin padaa, vahaan yah sambhav he ki ham neeche kii chattaanon se upar kii mitti kaa sambandh krambaddh rup se sthapit kar saken
 Although the top surface soil has a different look to the rock below, both have a chemical relationship and if the soil has not been brought from another site by natural action, ie, by water, or by blowing air
 , Then this relationship can be fully established
 chattan ke upar ek str aisa bhi paaya ja saktaa he jo chattan se hi bana he or abhi prakritik kriyaaon dwaara purnat: mitti ke rup main nahin aayaa he, sirf chattan ke mote-mote tukade ho gaye hai, jo na to mitti kahe ja sakate hai or na chattan
 The texture of soil is found in their upper surface
 isi str kii mitti main hamen neeche kii chattan ke rasinic or bhautik gunon kaa sanchay mil saktaa he
 If the rock is crystalline, it is likely 100 percent confirmed
 neeche kii chattan ke atyant nikatavarti, parshv bhaag main chattan ke samaan rasinic or bhautik gun praapt ho sakate hai
 As the distance increases upward, the outline of the rock will also change 
 ant main ham vah mitti pate hai, jo krishi ke liye atyant anukool siddh hui he or jisapar aadi kaal se krishi hoti aa rahi he tathaa manushya fasal paidaa karata rahaa he
 Some of the soil is formed from the rocks of other places due to natural reasons
 aise sthanon main yah sambhaavna nahin he ki upar kii mitti kaa bhautik tathaa rasinic sambandh neeche ke sanchay se sthapit kiya jaay, par yah nishchit he ki mitti kii utpatti chattaanon se hui he
 Organic matter is also found in the soil of the fields, along with the minerals of rocks, by the decay of tree plants
 sookshmdarshi dwaara tathaa rasinic vishleshan se pataa chalata he ki chattaanon kii chhijan kriya prakruti main paae janevaale rasinic dravyon ke prabhaav se dhire-dhire hoti he
 The chemical components of the rocks change and the outline of the soil appears to be quite different
 yadi chattan kaa chhijna hi mitti ke banane main ek pradhan kriya hoti to ham aaj kheton kii mitti ko paudhon ke penpaane ke liye anukool nahin pate
 The soil cannot be compared to a finely rocked PC
 yadhyapi chattaanon ke khanij mitti ke upree bhaag main bahut paae jate hai or unke tukade bhi bade pariman main vartmaan rahete hai, phir bhi mitti main jeev-jantu kriyaayein hoti rahati hai, jo krishi ke liye mahatvapurn sabit hui hai
 Due to the effect of fauna and the substances related to them, such as decayed plant material and rotten fauna, small particles of rocks obtained in the bud state are reacted and the color of the soil changes
 yah rup chattaanon ke sirf kanon kaa nahin rahata, mitti kaa ek naveen pranali kii bhusha se susajjit ho jaati he
 If we examine a piece of soil with a microscope and then by examining the particles of these rocks with the same instrument, we will find the difference between the two
 yah antar un acarbonic padaarthon ke sammishran se hota he jo jeev-jantu or paudhon se praapt hote hai
 The action that helps in the formation of soil due to the conversion of rocks into small particles by natural action is called weathering
 yah kriya mahatvapurn he or iske kaaran hi ham prithvi par mitti ko krishi ke anukool pate hai
 In this activity, water, oxygen in the air, carbon dioxide, bacteria and other acidic chemical substances are very helpful
 yah maani hui baat he ki jis mitti par prakritik kriyaayein hoti he, jal kaa prapaat tathaa vaayu or suryakiran kaa sansarg hota rahata he, vah kuch varsho main aisa rup dhaaran kar leti he jisase uske neeche kii bhinn rup rang or gunwali mittiyon ke bahut se sanstar ho jate hai
 If we dig a pit 10 or 12 feet deep on the top surface of the soil and observe the soil surface, we will regularly find many different colored, composed soil from one level to another
 vaigyanikon ne iske teen hi pradhan str maane hai or ve kin-kin kaarnon se or kin-kin paristhitiyon main paae jate hai, iskaa bhi varnan kiya he
 The water passes through the top layer of soil and carries many chemical substances to the bottom layer and there, along with the soil, changes the color form of soil by many chemical reactions
 is tarah upar se dravya aakar neeche ke sanstar main jamaa ho jate hai
 One of them is the upper bed, from which the matter is dissolved by water and goes downward, or deposited in the lower level by precipitation
 is upree sanstar ko ham sanstar kehete hai
 The second is the stratum, in which matter comes and accumulates by the action described above, it is called strata
 teesraa sanstar uske neeche he, jisamen upar kii mitti banati he, ise sanstar kehete he
 In other words, this bed is also called ancestral bed
 yah naam isaliye sarthak he ki isi sanstar se upar vaali mitti kii utpati hui he
 The rock and large debris made of it are found in this bed
 har ek sanstar main bhinn-bhinn sanstar sammilit rahete hai
 It is a very difficult problem to show the ordered relation of the strata
 is samasya ko pehle rus ke vaigyanikon ne hal kiya tha
 The most difficult problem appears when some portion of the top layer of soil is cut by erosion
 kabhi-kabhi to sampurna sanstar kaa kataav ho jaataa he or sanstar rah jaataa he
 The science in which research is conducted on the internal relationship of these beds is called soil science
 is vigyaan se mitti ke vargeekaran main adhik sahaayta milti he
 It is modern science and its progress is progressing
 ab yah praaia: siddh ho gaya he ki mitti kii upree sataha ke bhautik or rasinic gunon ko jaan lene se hi krishi ko laabh nahin ho saktaa
 In order to know the growing of plants and to advise the farmers, it is necessary to know the physical and chemical properties of the various soil layers and their interrelation
 mitti main vibhinn prakaar ke kan rahete hai
 The average amount of particles which are less in them, are required to make the soil fertile
 inke kaaran mitti kii mridukan rachana kii utpati hoti he
 By this composition, the action of water absorption in the soil is increased and various other types of foods for plants are also absorbed
 mitti ke bhautik gun mitti kii sanrachana, jalwaayu mitti main sthit ooshmaa evam khanij padaartho par nirbhar hai
 Clay particles are of different size types, some are big, some are small and some are very subtle
 bade aakaar ke kan chote-chote pattharon ke tukade hote hai
 As natural activity takes place on them, the larger pieces become smaller and eventually become the size of sand, silt, clay or loam soil
 mitti ke bade aakaar ke kan adhikansh balui mitti main paae jate hai or chote aakaar ke kan matiyaar mitti main milte hai
 By mixing of these two size particles, different types of soils are formed and they also have different physical properties
 mitti main sthit bhautik gunon kaa krishi vigyaan se atyant gaharaa sambandh he
 Some physical properties of soil, such as relative gravity, particle structure, particle size, soil solubility and cohesion, color, weight, particle size, particle size, etc
 are of importance, the relative gravity of soil is of two types, one virtual and the other absolute
 abhaasi aapekshik gurutv mitti ke bhitari bhaag main jal tathaa vaayu ke samavesh se praapt hota he, arthath yah mitti ke bhitari sthit khanij se mishrit jal or vaayu kaa gurutv he
 Therefore the amount of this gravity is less than absolute relative gravity
 kisi gyaat aaytan vaali shushk mitti ke bhaar or usee aaytanwale jal ke bhaar kaa yah anupaat he
 It ranges from 1
40 to 1
68
 chikani mitti or silt ke kan bahut chote or halke hote hai, isaliye ve ek duusare ke saath saghan nahin ho pate
 The weight of such soil is less
 matiyaar, domat tathaa silt mitti kaa bhaar jaanane ke liye use shushk bana diya jaataa he, kyonki bhinn-bhinn prakaar kii mitti main nami bhinn prakaar kii hoti he
 Absolute relative gravity is related to those parts of soil which are mineral elements
 is kaaran iskaa maan adhik hota he
 Absolute relative gravity is between 1
4 and 2
6
 mitti ke kan samooh banaate hai
 Different groups produce different types of soil
 ye kan ek duusare ke saath bhinn-bhinn prakaar se mili hue hai or inkaa parsparik sambandh drudh tathaa vyavasthit hota he
 Particles can be of any form and shape
 mitti kii urvartaa kanon ke vinyas par nirbhar he
 Plants require air and water, and air and water remain in the soil depending on the configuration of the particles
 ye kan samooh hai- Can occur
 kanon ke aakaar kaa prabhaav mitti ke anya bhautik gunon par bhi padataa he
 Partial holes of soil with larger size particles are larger
 aisi mitti main jal badi tivrata se neeche bah jaataa he, jisase nami kaa sadaa abhaav rahata he
 Such soil has the property of being heated and cooled quickly and such soil is weak
 chote chote kanwali mittiyon main visheshat: chikani mitti main, vipareet gun hote hai
 Water mixed with soil carbonic padaarthon kii upasthiti se bhi mitti main sughatyata aati hai
 Small particles increase solubility
 atberg ne sughatyata kii chaar avasthaaen batalaai hai, jo jal kii maatra par nirbhar karti hai
 Stretch is produced by the electric force on different particles of soil from each other, which is called cohesion
 sansanjan or sughatyata kaa paraspar sambandh he
 When one is more, the other becomes more

 Some soils are white, some red, some brown, some black and some ash-colored
 kahin kahin pili mitt bhi pai jaati he
 Due to the presence of different liquids, these colors are added to the soil
 mitti ke rang par bhi jalwaayu kaa prabhaav padataa he

 Water is very important in soil
 yah jal chaar prakaar kaa hota he: As long as the water is sufficient, the root of the plant keeps on doing its work
 dhire-dhire pani jab kam ho jaataa he tab aisi avasthaa aa jaati he ki paudhe kii jade pani kaa avasorana karne main asamarth ho jaati he or paudhe sookhne lagate hai
 In such a situation, the water in the soil is very less and a large amount of power is required to transmit it from the soil
 aisi avasthaa main jo jal mitti main he, use mlannigunank kehete he
 Its usefulness is high, because it gives the amount of soil colloid content
