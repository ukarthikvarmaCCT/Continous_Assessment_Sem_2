 jati vyavastha ko hi len, har koi kahata he ki islam gulaami or jati se mukt hona chahie, jabaki gulaami astitv main he or ise islam or islamic deshon se samarthan mila he
 While the prescriptions made by the Prophet about the justice and human treatment of slaves contained in the Quran are laudable, there is nothing in Islam that supports the abolition of this curse
 agar gulaami khatm bhi ho jaye par phir bhi musalamaanon ke bich jati vyavastha rah jaayegi
 He wrote that Muslim society has more social evils than Hindu society and Muslims hide them using soft words like "brotherhood"

 Baba Saheb Ambedkar made many efforts to improve Hindu religion and Hindu society, to achieve equality and respect, while being under Hindu religion for 10-12 years, but the heart of the upper caste Hindus did not change
 ulte unhen nindit kiya gaya or hindu dharm vinaashak tak kaha gaya
 After that he said that, "we made every effort and satyagraha to achieve the level of equality in Hindu society, but all proved fruitless
 hindu samaaj main samanta ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 "hindu society used to say that" humans are for religion "while Ambedkar believed that" religions are for humans
 " " ambedkar ne kaha ki aise dharm kaa koi matlab nahin jisamen manushyata kaa kuch bhi mulya nahin
 There is no point in living in such a religion which does not allow the followers of their own religion to get religious education, interrupts their jobs, insults them and even gives them water
 ambedkar ne hindu dharm tyaagane kii ghoshnaa kisi bhi prakaar kii dushmani va hindu dharm ke vinaash ke liye nahin kii thi balki unhone iskaa faisla kuch moulik siddhanton ko lekar kiya jinka hindu dharm main bilkul talmail nahin tha

He also called upon his followers to convert to any religion other than Hinduism
 unhone apni is baat ko bharat bhar main kai saarvajanik sabhaaon main bhi doharaaya

 Ambedkar made a deep study of all the major religions of the world between 21 years after he declared his conversion
 unke dwaara itnaa lanbaa samay lene kaa mukhya kaaran yah bhi tha ki wo chaahate the ki jis samay wo dharm parivartan karen unke saath zyada se zyada unke anuyaayi dharmantaran karen
 Ambedkar loved Buddhism because it has a coordinated form of three principles which is not found in any other religion
 buddha dharm pragna, karunaa or samta kii shiksha detaa he
 He said that man wants these things for auspicious and happy life
 devtaa or aatma samaaj ko nahin bachaa sakate
 According to Ambedkar, true religion is the one whose center is man and morality, based on science or intellectual element, not God, the center of religion, liberation of soul and salvation
 saath hi unka kahana tha dharm kaa kaary vishwa kaa punarnirmaan karnaa hona chahie naa ki uski utpatti or ant kii vyakhya karnaa

 The human whipworm is a round worm that causes trichuriasis when it infects a human large intestine
 It is commonly known as the whipworm which refers to the shape of the worm; it looks like a whip with wider "handles" at the posterior end
 The female T
 trichiura produces 2,000–10,000 single-celled eggs per day
 Eggs are deposited from human feces to soil where, after two to three weeks, they become embryonated and enter the “infective” stage
 These embryonated infective eggs are ingested and hatch in the human small intestine exploiting the intestinal microflora as hatching stimulus
 This is the location of growth and molting
 The infective larvae penetrate the villi and continue to develop in the small intestine
 The young worms move to the ceacum and penetrate the mucosa and there they complete development to adult worms in the large intestine
 The life cycle from time of ingestion of eggs to development of mature worms takes approximately three months
 During this time, there may be limited signs of infection in stool samples due to lack of egg production and shedding
 The female T
 trichiura begin to lay eggs after three months of maturity
 Worms can live up to five years, during which time females can lay up to 20,000 eggs per day
 Recent studies using genome-wide scan revealed two quantitative trait loci on chromosome 9 and chromosome 18 may be responsible for genetic predisposition or susceptibility to infection of T
 trichiura by some individuals
 Trichuris trichiura has a narrow anterior esophageal end and shorter and thicker posterior anus
 These pinkish-white worms are threaded through the mucosa
 They attach to the host through their slender anterior end and feed on tissue secretions instead of blood
 Females are larger than males; approximately 35–50 mm long compared to 30–45 mm
 The females have a bluntly round posterior end compared to their male counterparts with a coiled posterior end
 Their characteristic eggs are barrel-shaped and brown, and have bipolar protuberances
 Infection occurs through ingestion of eggs and is more common in warmer areas
 Whipworms eggs are passed in the feces of infected persons, and if an infected person defecates outside or if untreated human feces as used as fertilizer, eggs are deposited on soil where they can mature into an infective stage
 Ingestion of these eggs "can happen when hands or fingers that have contaminated dirt on them are put in the mouth or by consuming vegetables or fruits that have not been carefully cooked, washed or peeled
" The eggs hatch in the small intestine, and then move into the wall of the small intestine and develop
 On reaching adulthood, the thinner end burrows into the large intestine and the thicker end hangs into the lumen and mates with nearby worms
 The females can grow to 50 mm long
 Whipworm commonly infects patients also infected with Giardia, Entamoeba histolytica, Ascaris lumbricoides, and hookworms
 There is a worldwide distribution of Trichuris trichiura, with an estimated 1 billion human infections
 However, it is chiefly tropical, especially in Asia and, to a lesser degree, in Africa and South America
 Within the United States, infection is rare overall but may be common in the rural Southeast, where 2
2 million people are thought to be infected
 Poor hygiene is associated with trichuriasis as well as the consumption of shaded moist soil, or food that may have been fecally contaminated
 Children are especially vulnerable to infection due to their high exposure risk
 Eggs are infective about 2–3 weeks after they are deposited in the soil under proper conditions of warmth and moisture, hence its tropical distribution
 Whipworms develop when a dog swallows whipworm eggs, passed from an infected dog
 Symptoms may include diarrhea, anemia, and dehydration
 The dog whipworm is commonly found in the U
S
 It is hard to detect at times, because the numbers of eggs shed are low, and they are shed in waves
 Centrifugation is the preferred method
 There are several preventives available by prescription from a veterinarian to prevent dogs from getting whipworm
 The cat whipworm is a rare parasite
 In Europe, it is represented mostly by Trichuris campanula, and in North America it is Trichuris serrata more often
 Whipworm eggs found in cats in North America must be differentiated from lungworms, and from mouse whipworm eggs just passing through
 The hygiene hypothesis suggests that various immunological disorders that have been observed in humans only within the last 100 years, such as Crohn's disease, or that have become more common during that period as hygienic practices have become more widespread, may result from a lack of exposure to parasitic worms during childhood
 The use of Trichuris suis ova by Weinstock, et al
, as a therapy for treating Crohn's disease and to a lesser extent ulcerative colitis are two examples that support this hypothesis
 There is also anecdotal evidence that treatment of inflammatory bowel disease with TSO decreases the incidence of asthma, allergy, and other inflammatory disorders
 Some scientific evidence suggests that the course of multiple sclerosis may be very favorably altered by helminth infection; TSO is being studied as a treatment for this disease

 Oscar font based and Unicode Hindi based
 Till two or a year ago, Osci font based services were the only option available to us, in which we were happy to use different fonts ranging from Shusha to Webdunia, that we were e-mailing in Hindi Huh
 parantu in i-mail ke header, vishay pankti ityadi ke liye angreji anivaary hota he
 It is also mandatory that the font to which the e-mail is being sent is installed in the computer
 bhuule bhatke kabhi aapako kisi duusare computer par kahin or se hindi main i-mail karne yaa use dekhne kii naubat aati he yaa hindi i-mail ko kisi anya ko, aage agreshit karnaa hota he, to phir vahi font sambandhi samasyaayen uth khadi hoti hai
 Apart from this, there are problems in finding and saving your required e-mail based on Hindi words, since in reality you are working in Hindi through the letters of English
 is tarah kii samasyaayen i-mail claayent jaise ki outluk express tathaa web aadhaarit i-mail seva jaise ki web- duniya yaa rediff mail donon main hi samaan rup se aati hai
 Meanwhile, due to the different default configurations of different users, if the language encoding definition changes, then it becomes difficult to read the written text
 yahuu jaise lokapriy i-mail seva main bhi yah samasya aati rahati he
 To write i-mail hindi main likhi kaise jaye ? The solution to these problems is possible through Unicode Hindi based e-mail
 parantu yahan aapako duusari tarah kii samasyaon se do-chaar hona padataa he
 If you have an old operating system, it will not support Unicode and you will be unable to work in Unicode Hindi
 yadi aapkaa oparating system unicode kaa samarthan karata bhi he to aapkaa i-mail claayent or aapkaa brouzar bhi unicode hindi samarthan pradaan karne vaala hona chahie
 In some cases, such as Windows 98, Unicode Hindi support is not available at the operating system level, but by installing the full package of Internet Explorer 6 on it, it can be made partially usable with Unicode Hindi

 a beta version of G-mail has been released, which is on regular basis
 sambhav he iske purna sanskaran main hamen or bhi achche fichar milen
 One of the drawbacks of G-mail is that it runs on javascript, so for this, Java must be installed in your machine, and your browser must be able to run javascript
 udhaaharan ke liye web aadhaarit i-mail ke liye linaks system main mojila or firfox se to aap ise chalaa sakate hai, parantu kankarar broujar se nahin, jisamen java kaa kuch simit samarthan he
 But this is the fault of the browser and not the gmail
 windos system main aisi koi samasya nahin he chunki praaia: sabhi nae broujar javascript kaa samarthan karte hai
 Being based on javascript, users do not need to download new versions of Gmail separately
 Whenever you use g-mail, it remains the latest version

 G-mail, although released for free for general use, has not yet opened its subscription to the public
 is hetu aapako kisi maujhuuda ji-mail upayokta dwaara aamantrit kiya janaa aavashyak he
 However, there are many sites on the Internet from where you will get the account of G-mail for free

 Harivansh festival is the last festival of Mahabharata, it is also known as 'harivanshpuran'
 harivanshpurana main teen parv tathaa 318 adhyay hai
 According to the Sarvapratisarga of Purana Panchalakshan in the future of Harivanshpurana, the origin of the universe, the form of Brahm, incarnation calculation and Samkhya and Yoga have been considered
 smritisamagree tathaa sampradayik vichaardhaaraen bhi is parv main adhikansh rup main milti hai
 For this reason, this festival is known from Harivanshaparva and Vishnuparva
 vishnuparv main nrity or abhinayasambandhi saamagree apane moulik rup main milti he
 Bhalikya is mentioned in two places under this festival
 chhaaliky vaadyasangitamay nrity gyaat hota he

 On the occasion of Vasudeva's Ashvamegh Yajna in Vishnuparva, a nut named Bhadra is described to appease the sages with his act
 isi nat ke saath pradhyumna, samb aadi vajranabhapur main jaakar apane kushal abhinay se vahaan daityon kaa manoranjan karte hai

 According to Mr
 Dixit, the period of Matsya Purana is the third century
 krishnacharitra, raji kaa vrittant tathaa anya vrittanton se tulana karne par harivansh in puraanon se purvavarti nishchit hota he
 Therefore Vishnuparva and Bhavishparva of Harivamsa should be considered as the third century
 harivansh ke antargat harivanshaparv style or vrittanton kii drushti se vishnuparv or bhavishyaparv se pracheen gyaat hota he
 In the Ashwaghochata Vajra list, there are some verses literally resembling Harivamsa
 paashchaatya vidvan vaibar ne vajrasuchee ko harivansh kaa rini mana he or re choudhary ne unke mat kaa samarthan kiya
 The period of Ashwaghosh is almost second century
 yadi ashwaghosh kaa kaal dwitiya shatabdi he to harivanshaparv kaa kaal prakshipt sthalon ko chhodkar dwitiya shatabdi se kuch pehle samajhnaa chahie
 Poetry in Harivansh has its own characteristic like other ancient Puranas
 rasaparipaak or bhaavon kii samuchit abhivyakti main yah puraana kabhi kabhi utkrisht kaavyon se samanta rakhata he
 The allegorical passages reveal the talent and imagination of the mythological poet
 harivansh main upama, roopak, samasokti, atishyokti, vyatirek, yamak or anupras hi praaia: milte hai
 All these ornaments do not appear to have been attempted by the mythological poet
 kavyatatv kii drushti se harivansh main praarambhikta or moulikta he
 On comparing the Ritu Varnavarnas of Harivanshpuran, Vishnupuran, Bhagavatpuran and Padmapurana it is known that some expressions are depicted in their original beautiful form in Harivamsa and those expressions have become respectively or synthesized in the above Puranas
 saamagree or style ko dekhte hue bhi harivansh ek praarambhik puraana he
 Probably for this reason, the text of Harivansh is found pure from the text of other Puranas
 katipay paashchaatya vidwaanon dwaara harivansh ko swatantra vaishnav puraana athwa mahapurana kii koti main rakhana samichin he
 In this Purana, firstly we have told about the origin of Vaivastamanu and Yama and also about the incarnations of Lord Vishnu

 In logic, mathematics and computer science, interpreting is the process of adding meaning to the symbols of a formal language
 adhikansh aupchaarik bhashaayen keval vaakyavinyas dwraara hi paribhaashit hoti hai or unamem koi nihit arth nahin hota
 To understand the meaning, it is necessary to associate the meaning with the signs
 ham ek w { \ displaystyle { \ mathcal {W}}} naamak aupchaarik bhashaa bana sakate hai, jisaki varnmaala α = { △, ◻ } { \ displaystyle \ alpha = \ { \ triangle , \ square \ }} he, or uskaa ek niyam he ki is bhashaa main sunirmit shabd △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle } se armbh hone chaiye or uske baad bhashaa kii varnmaala se lekar koi bhi chinh jitani baar chaahe daalaa ja saktaa he
 Now, as a result, some words in this language will be: △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle} △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle}, △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle} ◻ { \ displaystyle \ square}, △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle} ◻ { \ displaystyle \ square} ◻ { \ displaystyle \ square} ◻ { \ displaystyle \ square} △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle}

 Sardar Udham Singh's name is recorded as revolutionary of Punjab in the freedom struggle of India
 unhone jaliyanvaala baag cond ke samay punjab ke garvanar general rahe maaikel o' dwir ko landan main jaakar goli maari
 Many historians believe that this massacre was a well-planned conspiracy by o'dwyer and other British officials, aimed at intimidating Punjabis to maintain control over Punjab
 yahi nahin, o' dwir baad main bhi general diar ke samarthan se peeche nahin hataa tha
 It is a common belief that Udham Singh killed General Dyer, responsible for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, because of the similar name, but historians believe that while Administrator o'dwyer was killed by Udham Singh, the general who carried out the firing was Dyer died in 1927 after suffering from paralysis and a variety of diseases
 uttar bhartiya rajya uttrakhand ke ek zile kaa naam bhi inke naam par udham singh nagar rakhaa gaya he
 Udham Singh was born on 26 December 1899 in the Kamboj family in Sunam village in Sangrur district, Punjab
 san 1901 main udhamsingh kii mata or 1907 main unke pita kaa nidhan ho gaya
 Due to this incident, he had to take shelter in an orphanage in Amritsar with his elder brother
 udhamsingh kaa bachapan kaa naam sher singh or unke bhai kaa naam muktasingh tha jinhen anathalay main kramash: udhamsingh or sadhusingh ke rup main nae naam mili
 According to historian Malti Malik, Udhamsingh was a symbol of all religion in the country and hence he changed his name to Ram Mohammad Singh Azad which is the symbol of three major religions of India
 anathalay main udhamsingh kii jindagi chal hi rahi thi ki 1917 main unke bade bhai kaa bhi dehanth ho gaya
 He became completely orphaned
 1919 main unhone anathalay chhod diya or krantikariyon ke saath milakar aazaadee kii ladaai main shamil ho gaye
 Udhamsingh was orphaned, but despite this he did not get distracted and continued to work to fulfill his pledge of freedom of the country and killing Dyer
 udhamsingh 13 april 1919 ko ghatit jaalianwala baag narsanhaar ke pratyakshdarshi the
 The exact number of people killed in Jallianwala Bagh could never be revealed due to political reasons
 is ghatana se vir udhamsingh tilamila gaye or unhone jalianwala baag kii mitti haath main lekar maaikel o diar ko sabak sikhaane kii pratigya le lee
 To carry out his mission, Udham Singh traveled to Africa, Nairobi, Brazil and the US by various names
 san 1934 main udham singh landan pahunche or vahaan 9, elder street commercial road par rahane lage
 There he bought a car for the purpose of travel and also a revolver with six bullets to complete his mission
 bharat kaa yah vir krantikari maaikel o diar ko thikaane lagane ke liye uchit vakt kaa intjaar karne laga
 Udham Singh got a chance to avenge the deaths of hundreds of his siblings in 1940
 jaliyanvaala baag hatyakand ke 21 saal baad 13 march 1940 ko royal central asian sosayadi kii landan ke kakston haal main baithak thi jahaan maaikel o diar bhi vaktaaon main se ek tha
 Udham Singh reached the meeting place on that day itself
 apni revolver unhone ek moti kitaab main chipa lee
 For this, he had cut the pages of the book into the shape of a revolver in such a way that Dior's life-threatening weapon could be easily hidden
 baithak ke baad diwaar ke peeche se morcha sambhalate hue udham singh ne maaikel o diar par goliyaan daag deen
 Two bullets hit Michael o Dyer, causing his immediate death
 udham singh ne vahaan se bhaagane kii koshish nahin kii or apni giraftaar de di
 He was prosecuted
 4 june 1940 ko udham singh ko hatya kaa doshi tehraaya gaya or 31 july 1940 ko unhen paintanville jail main faansee de di gai

 chalanaa yaa chaalan yaa tahalnaa bhoomi par jaanwaron kaa gaman yaa sanchalan kaa mukhya prakaar he or yah daudane or rengne se alag hota he
 Walking is different in this sense from running, because only one foot of human or two legs is eliminated from the ground at every step while walking, while at every step, both feet of human or two legs end contact with the ground
 
 ashwon or inke jaise anya jeevon me daudane ke kai prakaar ho sakate he par chalate samay har kadam par inke teen pair bhoomi par hote hai
 In this phase of today's life, walking by foot has become almost impossible and the person, despite knowing all these benefits, shies away from walking or should we say that all of us have become idle due to the arrival of machine age Has come in the fire aakhirkaar aisa ho bhi kyon na, jabaki vaigyanikon ke nit naye-naye avishkaron kii suvidhaon ne hamen aalasy ke is dharaatal par laa bithaaya he jisaki vajah se paidal chalanaa gaiyr jaruri sa lagane laga he
 In fact, it underscores a huge drawback
 paidal chalanaa hamaari roj kii dincharya rupi jindagi main kaaphi had tak kam ho gaya he, kintu vartmaan samay main yah swasthya ke liye pehle se bhi zyada mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 Walking is also equivalent to an exercise
 jahaan praat:kaal tahalne se sampoorn sharir par ek khaas asar padataa he vahiin sharir main ek khaas asar padataa he vahiin sharir main haathon, ghutanon evam janghaon jaise jodon ke dard se nijaat bhi dilaataa he
 Walking in the morning is good for health in every respect
 aashcharya kii baat to yah he ki paidal chalane se buudhe bhi jawan mahasoos karte hai kyonki aisa karne par unke uttakon kii marammat kaa kaary bhalee-bhaanti sampann ho jaataa he
 That is why if you keep in mind the desire to look young, then walk more and more
 yakeenan swasthya ke liye laabhakaari sabit hoga
 Walking not only makes the digestive system work properly, but it also benefits a person suffering from constipation
 or to or, tahalne se shaareerik swasthya uttam rahane ke saath-saath usase kahin adhik hamaare maansik swasthya ko phayda hota he
 It is important to note that this trend has been used for centuries to relieve fatigue and tension of the mind, because the structure of a person's feet is more suitable for walking than running
 daudane se zyada urja kharch hoti he jabaki pairon ke agle hisse masalan panjon par chalane vaale edi par chalane waalon kii tulana main 53 pratishat se 63 pratishat zyada urja kharch hoti he
 Not only this, the movement of the main muscles of the ankle, knee, hip and back increases to a large extent in comparison to walking on the heel while walking on the front of the feet
 isliye kehete hai ki daudane kii bajaay chalanaa hi behatar hota he
 The thing that should be kept in mind while walking is that it is important to remember the physical posture while walking otherwise it does not get the desired benefit
 tahaltey samay sharir ko bilkul sidhaa hona chahie tathaa munh band hona chahie or saans puri tarah naak ke maarg se hi lenaa chahie
 Only then will it prove profitable
 koshish karen ki fefdon ke bajaay pet se saans len
 This gives more oxygen to the body which goes to the brain and this increases the ability to think and understand
 haalanki paidal kabhi bhi chal sakate hai parantu visheshgyon ke anusaar tahalne ke liye praat:kaaleen or sandhya ke samay ko upyukt mana jaataa he kyonki us samay sharir se steroid hormone adhikadhik nikalate hai jo insaan ko sukhad anubhav mahasoos karaate hai
 So when we go out for a walk, we should give priority to habits like walking in the middle of trees and trees in the middle of the park instead of walking on the road and streets
 yah ek tathy he ki ghoomane se hamen maansik prasannataa kaa sanchaar dikhaai detaa he
 Walking can completely rejuvenate
 itnaa hi nahin, padhane vaale bacchon ke liye subah bhraman karnaa behad hi laabhadaayak he kyonki subah niyamit rup se tahalne se ekaagratha kaa sahaj hi vikaas hota he jisase yaad karne main adhik kathinaayee mahasoos nahin hoti
 According to experts, morning walk causes the endorphin hormone to be secreted in the brain due to which our mood changes and positive emotions arise
 isiilie aaj se hi paidal chalane kaa aham faisla kar lijie or taiyaar ho jaaie suryoday evam suryaast ke samay lambii jogging tak jane ke liye jo ki duniyaan kii sabase behtareen kasarat he
 Anyway, walking is life, so why not go for a lot of walking
