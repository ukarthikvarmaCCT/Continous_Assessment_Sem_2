 prayek jantu yaa vanaspati ek nishichat vaataavaran main rahata he
 Ecologists explore the fact that organisms interact with each other and with the environment and explore the complex structure of life on Earth
 paristhitiki ko anvyranmental biology bhi kaha jaataa he
 The subject studies the individual, population, communities and ecosystem
 ichology arthath paristhitiki shabd kaa pratham prayog 1866 main german jeevvaigyanik arnest haikal ne apni pustak "janarel morpology der organizmen" main kiya tha
 Studies on the relationship between man and his environment began in the early twentieth century, and attention was paid to several subjects simultaneously
 parinamswaroop maanav paristhitiki kii sankalapana aayi
 The natural environment is highly complex, so researchers mostly research the species or plants of a variety of animals

 Human beings consume some part of the vegetation and some parts leave it completely unusable

 In addition, ecology can also be studied in urban environments
 vaise ichology kaa adhyayan prithvi kii sataha tak hi simit nahin, samudri janajivan or jalsroton aadi par bhi yah adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Studies on marine life have so far been reduced, as many old myths were broken in the twentieth century with new information about marine folding, and organisms living at higher pressures and lower oxygen at depth
 paristhitik tantra ke mukhyatah do prakaar ke sanghatak hoten he - Ecology studies the relationship between living organisms and their non-living environment at different levels or scales

 Over time, due to urbanization and industrialization, humans lost contact with nature and in the so-called blind race of development, it ceased to realize that nature is also a living force

 ek goli ek prakshepya he jise ek revolver, gulel, yaa hawaii bandook se chalaaya jaataa he
 Bullets generally do not contain explosives, but they penetrate their targets with full effect and damage them
 shabd "goli" kaa upyog kabhi kabhi barood, yaa ek kaartoos ke liye bhi aamtaur par kiya jaataa he, jo goli, khol, powder or primer kaa mishran hota he
 Therefore, the use of the word "bullet" to describe ammunition or cartridges is not technically correct
 goliyon kaa itihaas utana hi purana he jitna ki banduukon kaa
 Originally, bullets were balls of metal or stone that were used as a weapon and in a slingshot for hunting
 ant main jab banduukon kaa vikaas ho gaya, inhen choti gendon ko ek band tub ke ant main gan powder ke ek visphotak charge ke saamne rakhaa jane laga
 As the gun became more technologically advanced, from 1500 to 1800 there was little change in the bullets
 ve sise kii saadhaaran round gende hoti thim, jinhen rounds kaha jaataa tha, inke keval vyas main bhinnata milti thi
 Molded lead balls were used as projections with the development of hand culverines and matchlock archwebs
 The word "bullet" is derived from the French word Bullette, which means small ball
 bandook main prayukt mul goli ek gol sise kii gend thi jo ek bor se choti hoti thi, ise deele feet paper ke ptch main lapeta jaataa tha, jo beral main powder ke upar goli ko dridhtaa se pakad letaa tha
 Was called isiilie, puraane smood bor brown base or isi tarah kii sainya banduukon ke saath, goliyon ko bandook main lod karnaa aasaan hota tha
 On the other hand, the original funnel-loading rifle, in which the bullets were fitted more closely to rifle the grooves, was more difficult to load, especially when the barrel bore had deteriorated from previous firing
 For that reason, early rifles were not used for military purposes
 unnisvin sadi kii pehle pachaas saalon main goli kii akruti or kaaryon main vishisht parivartan dekhe gaye
 In 1826, Delvigne, a French infantry officer, invented a breech with unconnected shoulders, on which a circular bullet was injected until it was loaded into the grooves of the rifle
 haalanki, delvigne kaa tarika thik nahin tha or isane goli ko vikrut kar diya
 The first bullet in a series of pointed or "cone-shaped" bullets was designed in 1823 by Captain John Norton of the British Army
 norton kii goli main ek khokhla aadhaar tha jo bairal kii rifling ke liye, firing karne par dabaav ke saath fail jaataa tha
 The British Ordnance Board disapproved of it as the circular bullet was in use for the last 300 years
 prasiddh angreji bandook banane vaale wiliam greenar ne 1836 main greenar goli kaa avishkaar kiya
 It was very similar to Norton's bullet, with one difference being that its hollow base was fitted with a wooden plug that exerted more definite pressure on the base to expand and hold the rifling
 pareekshan se yah sabit ho gaya ki greenar kii goli bahut prabhavi thi lekin ise sainya upyog ke liye asweekrut kar diya gaya kyonki, yah mana gaya ki do bhaag hone ke kaaran iskaa nirmaan bahut mushkil he
 The soft lead mini ball was released in 1847 by Claude Attini Mini, a captain of the French Army
 yah lagbhag greenar goli ke samaan thi
 The Mini was designed by a cone-shaped bullet with a hollow cavity in its rear, with a small iron cap fitted instead of a wooden plug
 jab isse fire kiya jaataa tha yani goli chalayi jaati thi, to lohe kii topi bullate ke rear par khokhli gupha main chali jaati thi, jiske dwaara rafiling ko majboot karne ke liye bullate ke said fail jate the
 In 1855, the British adopted a mini ball for their Enfield rifle
 mini ball kaa pehali baar sabase zyada istemaal america naagarik yuddh ke dauraan kiya gaya
 Roughly in this war, 90% of casualties were due to mini balls fired from rifles
 1854 or 1857 ke bich, sar joseph vitworth ne rifl par ek lambi shrinkhalaa main prayog kiye or anya binduon main, chote bor ke phaayde ko sabit kiya or, vishesh rup se, lambi goli ke phaayde ko bhi pramanit kiya
 Witworth's bullet was made in such a way that it could be mechanically fitted to the grooves of the rifle
 Witworth's pill was never adopted by the government, although it was used extensively for match purposes and target practice between 1857 and 1866, when it was gradually replaced by Metford
 1862 ke aas paas or iske baad, dablyoo
 i
 metford ne bullate or rifl par kai prayog kiye or badhati hui sarpil ke saath lit rifling kii mahatvapurn pranali or ek sakht goli kaa avishkaar kiya
 The combined result was that in December 1888, lee-metford's small bore rifle, Mark I, was finally adopted by the British Army
 lee-metford, lee-enfield kii purvavarti thi
 The next significant change in the history of rifle bullets came in 1882, when Edward Rubin, director of the Swiss Army Laboratory at Thun, invented a copper-jacketed bullet — a long shot whose lead core was that of a copper
 Was kept in a jacket
 yah bhi chote bor vaali thi or yah 8mm kii "label bullate" kii purvarti he jise Mle 1886 kii label rifl ke dhune rahit powder barood ke liye apanaaya gaya tha
 The surface of lead bullets fired at high speed can melt due to hot gases present and friction with the bore
 kyonki tambe kaa galnaank ucch hota he or vishisht ushma or kathorta kaa maan bhi bhi adhik hota he, copper kii jacket main upasthit goliyon ke kaaran thuthan kii gati bad jaati he
 Modernized aerodynamics led to the development of the pointed Spitzer bullet
 beesvin sadi kii shuruyaat tak, duniya kii adhikansh senaayen spitzar bullate kii ore sankramit ho gayin thim
 These bullets could be fired more accurately and had more energy
 spitger bullate or mashin gan ke sangyojan ne yuddh kii ghaatkata ko bahut adhik badha diya
 The most modern refurbishment that took place in the shape of a bullet or bullet is a boat-like tail, a grounded base for the Spitzer bullet
 ucch jab hawa goli ke antim sire par teji se hokar jaati he, tab nirvaat utpann ho jaataa he, jisase projectile kaa veg kam ho jaataa he
 The design of the tailbone, such as a base boat, allows air to flow over the surface of its end, reducing the form drag
 iske parinamswaroop vayugatiki laabh ko vartmaan main rifl takanic ke liye anukool akruti ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 The first combination of the Spitzer and the boat-like tail bullet is named Bell "D" after its discoverer, it was released as standard military ammo in 1901, for the French-labeled Model 1886 rifle
 bullate ke dizin main do praathmik samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karnaa he
 a seal with the bore of the gun should be made in them first
 If a strong seal is not made, the gas will leak from the propellant charge after the bullet is removed, which will reduce this efficiency
 bullate ko rifling kii prakriya main is tarah se kaam karnaa chahie ki bandook ke bor ko koi kshati naa pahunche
 The tablets should have a surface that forms this seal without causing too much friction
 bullate or bor ke bich is antarkriya ko aantarik prakshepiki kaha jaataa he
 Bullets should be produced at a high standard, as surface deformities may affect firing accuracy
 bairal se nikalne ke baad goli ko prabhavit karne vaali bhautikee, bahari prakshepiki kehalaati he
 Factors that affect the aerodynamics of a bullet flying are the shape of the bullet and the rotation caused by the rifling of the barrel of the gun
 ghurni bal goli ko vayugathik rup se or gayroscopy rup se sthirikrut karte hai
 Any asymmetry in a bullet or bullet is largely canceled out when it spins
 chikne bor kii banduukon ke saath, ek golakaar akruti anukool thi kyonki is baat se koi fark nahin padataa ki yah kaise unmukh hui, isane ek samtal saamne vaale hisse ko prastut kiya
 These unstable bullets would collapse erratically, or roll backward and disastrously, providing only moderate accuracy, although the aerodynamic shape changed little over the centuries
 aam taur par, goli kii akritiyaan vayugatiki, aantarik prakshepiki jaruraton or antim prakshepiki aavashyaktaaon ke bich ek samjhauta thim
 Another method of stabilization for the pellet's mass center is to stay as far ahead as in practice in a mini ball or shuttlecock
 isse goli vayugatiki ke madhyam se saamne kii ore aage udaan bharti he
 See how the terminal ballistics and / or pill design affects its stopping ability, what happens when a bullet affects an object
 prabhaav ke parinaam kaa nirdhaaran lakshya saamagree ke sanghatan or ghanatv, aapatan kone or khud goli ke veg or bhautik gunon ke dwaara hota he
 The bullet is usually designed in such a way that it can penetrate, deform and / or break the target
 ek di gayi saamagree or goli ke liye, takaraane kaa veg vah praathmik kaarak he jo parinaam kaa nirdhaaran karata he
 In fact, there are many bullet shapes and they are of many types and a table can be found in any reloading manual that sells bullet molds
 RCBS, kai nirmaataaon main se ek he, jo kai bhinn dizin pesh karata he, jo basic round ball se shuru hote hai
 With a mold, one can also make bullets at home to reload their shelled ammo, where local laws allow this
 haath se casting, haalaanki, thos sise kii goliyon ke liye keval samay- or laagat- prabhavi he
 Cast and jacketed bullets have also been commercially made available by numerous manufacturers for hand loading and are much more convenient than lead casting bullets
 thuthan se lod kii jane vaali banduukon yaa blike powder ke liye bulats ko shuddh sise se dhalaai karke banaaya jaataa tha
 This worked well for low speed bullets, which were fired at speeds less than 450 m / s
 aadhunik banduukon se fire kii jane vaali thodi si zyada gati kii goliyon ke liye, sise or tin kaa ek adhik sakht mishradhatu yaa tipasetter kaa sisa behatar he
 For more high-speed bullets, jacketed bullets are used
 in sabhi main saamaanya tatv sisa he, jiskaa upyog bade paimaane par kiya jaataa he kyonki iskaa ghanatv adhik hota he or isliye yah yah adhik dravyaman uplabdh karaata he- or is prakaar se, ek die gaye aaytan ke liye adhik gatij urja utpann karata he
 Lead is also cheap, it is easy to obtain, it is easy to work on, it melts at low temperatures, it is easy to use in making bullets or bullets for all these reasons
 yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki sisa vishaiylla hota he, jisase yah ek zyada khatarnaak hathiyaar ban jaataa he
 The 1868 Declaration of St
 Petersburg prohibited the use of explosive projectiles weighing less than 400 grams
 hegg kanvension virdohi paksh ke vardidhari sainya karmiyon ke khilaaf vardidhari sainya karmiyon ke dwaara vishesh prakaar ke barood ke upyog ko nishiddh karata he
 These include projectiles that explode within an individual, specific, and expanding bullet
 geneva sammelnon se sambandhit, vishesh paaramparik hathiyaaron par 1983 ke sammelan ke protocol III main, nagarikon ke khilaaf aag lagane vaale barood ke upyog ko nishiddh kiya gaya
 In these treaties, no one prohibits tracer or speaks of prohibited bullets in military equipment
 ye sandhiyaan yahan tak ki pistal, rifl or mashin gan main prayukt 
22 LR bulats par bhi lagu hoti hai
 Therefore, special bullets were developed during World War II for the high standard HDM pistol, a 
22 LR suppressed pistol, using bullets with full metal jackets instead of hollow point bullets, which
 22 were suitable for LR rounds
 bullate shabd kaa upyog, aamtaur par isaki gati ke kaaran kabhi kabhi alankaarik rup se kiya jaataa he, udhaaharan: The contents of this article have been included from the eleventh edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, a publication, which is displayed for the general public

 One of the main merits of the first three religions is that of monotheism
 vahiin hindu dharm vividhtaon main vishwaas rakhane vaala dharm he
 Under Hinduism, every person is a symbol of God or Ishvara along with the announcement of Tattam Asi
 yah ek se anek hone kii prakriya he
 We need to research their background to compare these religions
 abrahamik parivaar ke teenon dharm marusthal main paidaa huye huye dharm he or hindu dharm multah nadi ke kinare paidaa hone vaala dharm he
 There is no diversity in the desert
 ekmaatr chaaron taraf faili hua balumay dharti hi drushtigochar hoti he
 In such a situation, the experience of the same boundless power is a natural emotion
 manushya ko ishvar kii chetana saadharantay prakruti ke madhyam se hi hoti he
 When there is no diversity in nature, then the religion emanating from the sacraments and rituals will also be devoid of diversity
 teenon abrahamik dharmon kaa udbhav sthal registan hi hua
 So like the desert, there is monotony or monotony and just like desert, it is also unchangeable
 teenon dharmon main dher sari samaanthyein hai
 Like a god
 ek sarvashaktimaan ishvar jo sansar ke jeevon ko sanchalit kata he or unke paap karne par unhen sajaa detaa he
 That is, the rule of God rests on the power of fear

 There is only a word for sin

 Its main purpose is to study the microorganism world
 isamen prakaash ke paravartan, apvartan, vivartan or vidyutchumbakeey vikiran kaa prayog hota he
 This branch of science is mainly used in biology
 vishwa bhar main rogon ke niyantran or nai aushadhiyon kii khoj ke liye microscopy kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 The three popular branches of microscopy include optical, electron and scanning probe microscopy
 microscopy vishay kaa aarambh 17veen shatabdi ke aarambh main hua mana jaataa he
 At the same time when scientists and engineers discovered lenses in physics
 lens ke avishkaar ke baad vastuon ko unke mul aakaar se bada kar dekhnaa sambhav ho paaya
 This made the philosophy of activities of small and other microscopic animals found in water accessible and the scientists got to know new facts about them
 iske baad hi vaigyanikon ko yah bhi gyaat hua ki praani jagat ke bare main apaar sansar unki pratiksha main he va unka gyaan ab tak kitna kam tha
 Visual microscopy is considered to be the earliest birth as a branch of microscopy
 ise prakaash sookshmdarshan bhi kaha jaataa he
 It is used to see the organs of animals
 prakaash sookshmdarshi apekshaakrit mahange kintu behatar upkaran hote hai
 The discovery of electron microscopes in the field of microscopy is considered an extremely important milestone because after its discovery it was possible to see objects several thousand times larger than their actual size
 isaki khoj beesvin shatabdi main hui thi
 Although the electron microscope is costlier than other microscopes and it is not possible for students to use it in the laboratory, the results are much better
 isse praapt chitra ekadam spasht hote hai
 Another technique is used in microscopy, which is considered better than electron microscopy
 isamen haath or salaai ke prayog se vastu kaa kai konon se pareekshan hota he
 Graham Stein first noticed the bacteria in this process
 sookshmdarshiki bhautikee kaa ek abhinn ang he
 Today microscopes are widely used in medicine, biology, phylology, metrology, crystallology and the study of metals and plastics
 aaj sookshmdarshi kaa upyog vastuon ko dekhne ke liye hi nahin hota varan dravyon ke kanon ke maapne, gananaa karne or taulne ke liye bhi iskaa upyog ho rahaa he
 The tendency of man is always to know and see more and more, that is why he wants to solve the mysteries of nature more and more
 hamaari indriyon kii kaary karne kii kshamta simit he or sahi yahi haal hamaari aankh kaa bhi he
 It also has its own limits
 bahut dur kii jo vastu khaali aankh se dikhaai nahin padati vah doordarshee se dekha ja sakati he yaa bahut nikat kii vastu kaa vistrut vivaran sookshmdarshi se adhik spasht dekha ja saktaa he
 Here the progress made in the field of microscopes since 1865 AD is being mentioned here: ekal uttal lens, jise saadhaarant: aavardhan lens kehete hai, saralatam sookshmdarshi kaha ja saktaa he
 It is also called 'JB microscope'
 saral sookshmdarshi ek nishchit duuri par sthit do uttal lenson ke sangyojan se bana hota he
 The lens facing towards the hemisphere is called the visible lens and the lens near the eye is the 'actress lens'
 aise sookshmdarshi kaa drushtikshetra simit hota he
 This needs improvement
 abhinytra lens main ek lens jodne se kshetra bad jaataa he or goleey varnavipathan evam varniya varnavipathan se utpann dosha kam ho jate hai
 Such microscopes are called combined microscopes or light microscopes or conventional optical microscopes
 yadhyapi prakaash ke paravartan, apvartan or rekhiy sancharan ke niyam greek darshanikon ko isa se kuch shatabdiyon purv se hi gyaat the par aapatan kone or apvartan kone ke jya ke niyam kaa avishkaar satrahavin shatabdi ke uttarardh tak nahin hua tha
 Snell of Holland and Dekart of France invented it differently

 It is said that his Pakas had a large lens
 sookshmdarshi kaa sutarapaat yaheen se hota he
 The creation of the microscope is attributed to Zecharios Jonamides, a botanist
 hygange ke anusaar avishkaar kaa shrey cornelius drable ko he
 The condition of microscopes remained the same until Abe's time
 1870 i
 main aibe ne sookshmdarshi kii sadrudh neenv daali
 He brought out the famous oil immersion technology
 isse sarvotkrisht vaishamy or aavardhan praapt hua
 But as far as the study of parasites was concerned, scientists were still feeling helpless
 1873 i
 main aibe ne anubhav kiya ki sookshmdarshi ko chaahe kitni hi purnataa pradaan karne kaa praytn kiya jaae kisi padaarth main uske kanon kii sookshmata ko ek seemaa tak hi dekha ja saktaa he
 It is impossible to see an atom or molecule only with our eyes because there is a limitation of our eyes seeing microscopic objects
 yah seemaa upkaran kii apurnataa ke kaaran hi nahin parantu prakaash tarangon kii prakruti ke kaaran bhi he jinke prati hamaari aankh samvedansheel he
 If we want to see metals, our biologists have to develop a new type of eye that will receive waves that are thousands of times smaller than the waves that our current normal eyes, or astrology, can perceive
 vastav main kisi vastu main sthit do nikatavarti binduon ko kabhi bhi alag pahachaanaa nahin ja saktaa he yadi us prakaash kaa tarang dairghy jisamen un binduon kaa avlokan kiya jaataa he un binduon ke bich kii duuri ke dugane se adhik na ho
 In this way it limits their disillusionment
 ise vibhedan kii seemaa kehete hai
 In mathematics it is expressed by the following relation
 vibhedan yaa pruthakkaran kii seemaa Where NA is the numerical bisector and NA = sin
 yahan u vastu duuri kaa apvartanaank he
 q is the angle that the rim ray makes along the optical axis
 is prakaar drushti vikiran kaa vichaar karne se alpatam vibhedan duuri 3000 A° ke lagbhag hoti he
 For the smallest ultraviolet and infrared rays, this limit will be around 1500 a ° and 3850 a °, respectively, where 1 a ° = 10-8 cm
 aaie ham apane ko purv ke sookshmdarshikivid ke rup main sochen or un sudhaaron par vichaar karen jo ham us samay karnaa chaahate the
 Generally, we focus our hopes on four things: uparyukt sudhaar yaa kathinaaiyon kaa vastu kii prakruti, pradipti ke prakaar or photography takneekee ne san 1895 main eks kiran kaa avishkaar kiya
 But until 1912, there was no idea of the wave nature of the x ray until Van Lauey proved it
 ab yah aashaa hui ki eks-re sookshmdarshi banaaya ja saktaa he
 So this idea was abandoned at that time
 kuch varshon baad 1923 i

 Electron beam can also be twisted by suitable electric or magnetic fields
 aise sookshmdarshi jinhen safaltaapurvak upyog main laayaa ja saktaa tha 1947 i
 main nol, rask or brukh ne prastut kiye
 The wavelength of this radiation is expressed by the following relation
 yahan h plank kaa niyatank he, m electron kaa dravyaman or q veg hai
 Velocity is the function of voltage, which is used to accelerate the electron beam
 is sookshmdarshi se 10 A° tak vibhedan sambhav tha or isaki aavardhan kshamta bahut adhik thi
 Objects of 1
6
10-8 mm extension can be seen by this
 nihsandeh yah badi thos pragati he or iske saath-saath anek nae avishkaar jude hue hai
 Today, electron microscopy has many techniques of its own
 ucch urja electron kii bhanti laghutarangdairghy ke saath-saath eks kirnon main vedhankshmata bahut adhik hoti he or ve kam shighrata se avashoshit bhi hoti hai
 Thus, x rays can be used to determine the internal structure of small opaque objects
 eranverkh ne 1947 i
 main pehla eks kiran sookshmdarshi yaa chaaya sookshmdarshi nikaala or 1948 i
 main kink patric or bejay ne uskaa sudhaar kiya
 Like an electron microscope, vacuum is not required here
 achche pratibimb ke liye keval sookshm chhidr kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 This means that less radiation enters and hence exposures are much larger
 peeche chitra kaa bada vistaar karnaa padataa he jiske liye bahut sookshm kanon kaa paayas aavashyak hota he
 Now let us look at general visible light microscopy
 iske purv ki ham us disha main hua pragati par vichaar-vimarsh kare, hamen un aakankshaon par dhyaan rakhana hoga jo 40 varsh purv sookshmdarshikividon kii thi
 It was not possible to fulfill all the requirements with a single device
 vibhedan kshamta main vruddhi sankhyatmak dwarak ke maan se simit ho jaati he jiskaa maan 1
5 se adhik nahin ho saktaa
 There is also a limit to the increase of the magnification capacity of the system
 yah prayukt leson kii focus duriyon kaa falan he
 Magnification is the inverse function of the focus distance, so the lack of focus distance leads to magnification
 par saath hi kriyaatmak duuri nasht ho jaati he
 Because of such ideas, Birch built reflective microscopes in 1947 in Bristol using mirrors in place of lenses
 siddhantat: parabangnee kiran tak vikiran kaa upyog yahan sambhav ho sakaa
 It has a lower numeric gateway but has the advantage of greater achromaticity and greater functional distance
 chunki quartz 2000 A° tak vikiran kaa avasorana nahin karata isliye us sookshmdarshi se jisamen kwatarj lenson kaa upyog hota he, kam se kam vibhedan duuri 1,000 A° praapt hogi at: is prakaar ke vinyas ke saath parabangnee vikiran ke upyog se 'parabangnee sookshmdarshi' kaa nirmaan hota he
 If an ordinary light microscope is used to collect radiation scattered by small objects, this type of arrangement is called a microscope
 pro jernik ne sookshmdarshi main kala vaishamy pradipti kaa upyog kiya
 This technology was called art contrast microscope
 yah rangahin visheshat: paardarshak padaarthon kii sanrachana dikhaane kii vidhi he
 Differentiation is seen in them due to different structures, such as in the frog's liver
 vaishamy ko sudhaarney ke liye jaivikivid ranjakon kii sahaayta lete hai
 This is usually done with contrasting color filters
 dhruvit prakaash se kuch hi kism ke crystalon kaa vishleshan kiya ja saktaa he par kalavaishamy se sab prakaar ke crystalon kaa adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he
 This technique does not use artificial colors as a stain
 abhiranjan main dosha yah bataaya jaataa he ki yadhyapi abhiranjan jeevon kaa koshikaon ko nasht nahin karata he, tathaapi aisa nahin kaha ja saktaa ki vah jeevon yaa koshikaon ko bilkul prabhavit nahin karata
 The advantage of art-contrast method is that illumination, which is required in every microscope, does not require anything else to see the organism
 kala vaishamy sookshmdarshi main sookshmdarshi saamaanya kism kaa hi rahata he
 There is only this novelty that a new light device is added
 pa ek kaanch kaa plate he jisamen ek valayakaar khaanchaa he
 The plate is coated with a transparent coating of calcium fluoride
 lep kii motaai ek si rahati he
 In vacuum, evaporation is plastered
 lep kii motaai thik itani rahati he ki khaanchaa or plate ke anya bhaag dwaara paarit prakaash ke bich ke samay kaa antar kampan kaa chaturthaansh rahe
 There is a curtain in which there is a annular cut which passes through as much light in the landscape as it would fill in the grooves of the Kalapatta
 vastu dwaara bikharit or vivartit prakaash khaanche dwaara paarit nahin hota or yah prakaash jab pratibimb par pahunchataa he, tab vah strot se sidhe pahunche prakaash se mila hua nahin hota he or vyatikaran chitra banataa he
 This is reflected in the actress
 vastu ke vibhinn ang apvartanaank ke anusaar prakaash main vibhinn kalantar pradarshit karte hai at: abhinytra main dikhaai padane vaala pratibimb vastu kaa apvartanaank chitra hota he
 This microscope became available for use by 1952 AD
 1952 i
 main is uplabdhi ke liye pro jernik ko nobel puraskaar mila
 Dyson solved this problem differently in 1951, which led to the creation of interfacing microscopes that had some superiority over conventional articular microscopes
 isamen vastu kii kaanch ke do ardhrajtit patton ke madhya main dabaa diya jaataa he or use ek vishesh darpan pranali se is prakaar dekha jaataa he ki kuch prakaash abhinaytrak main bina vastu se paarit hue sidhaa chalaa jaae or shesh prakaash vastu se hokar jaae
 The expressed expression thus expresses the refractive index structure of the finge object
 vastut: do prakaar kii yah pradipti dhundli prishthbhumi or kalavaishamy maanav ke liye ek bada mahatv kaa saadhan he
 The blurred background illumination has proven useful in observing extremely fine particles, and art contrast illumination has increased the technical possibility of knowing the minimum change in optical density so that reflection can be easily explained
 ham dekhte hai ki chalis varsh purv ke sookshmdarshividon kii anek aakankshaayen puri ho gai hai
 This is not the end here because there is no end of research and the same is for microscopy and efforts are still being made to increase the above limit of differentiation capacity of magnification capacity
 nae kism ke kaanch or plastic ke upyog se sookshmdarshiki kii takneekee main or bhi pragati hona anivaary he
 From all these microscopes, which have been described, only in detail can be obtained

 Numerology and numerology were popular among early mathematicians such as Pythagoras, but are no longer considered a part of mathematics and are recognized by modern scientists as pseudo-mathematics
 yah usee tarah he jaise jyotish vidya main se khagol vidya or rasvidya se rasayan shaastra kaa aitihaasik vikaas he
 Today, numerology is often invisible as well as associated with the arts of astrology and the like

 ISBN: 0-9640321-3-9 namakan prakriya : The scientific study of the traditional faith is a brief introduction to new discoveries on the sweet relation of human life and religion
 vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki paraprakritik vishwaas kaa logon ke jivan main lambe samay se mahatva rahaa he, shaaman yaa ojha ke punahnirmit itihaas ke aadhaar par yah avadhi 65000 varsh hogi
 Along with the development of civilization, the traditional belief took the form of religion, and influenced literature, art and society
 anumaan he ki puure vishwa main lagbhag 1 xxrep 4 0 dharm hai, or prayek dharm main anekon alokik tatv 
 Scientists think that, most of the deities are confined to small communities, but some deities must have started to develop in large religions from about 12000 years ago and spread in the world
 pichley kuch dashakon main, paraprakritik vishwaas ke jaivik or saanskrithik udvikas par nai khojon main vaigyanikon ne spasht kiya ki unka aashay kisi alokik tatv kii bhautik satta se nahin tha, unhone paaya ki devi-devataaon main vishwaas samooh ke sadasyon main sahyog, maansik swasthya tathaa sneh kii bhaavana ke vikaas main sahaayak he
 Discoveries in literature and art show that they also have a deep penetration of the traditional faith, and a unique inclusion of supernatural elements, such as a Russell's teapot, flying saucer, spider-man, etc
 devi-devataaon main vishwaas par hue in adhyayanon ke chaar mukhya pahalu gramin parivesh, maansik swasthya, sahyog, or sneh kii bhaavana hai
 Countless articles related to the traditional belief fall into this aspect and reflect the lifestyle of local groups
 aise parichay vishwa, tathaa kshetreey, jaise pashchim himalay, str par, vistrut rup main uplabdh hai
 In these, a rural deity is said to have supernatural, jurist, physician, Mahavira, prophet, etc
 inkaa vistrut varnan bhi he, jaise bharat main, himachal pradesh ke kinnaur jile ke lok devtaa, or unase sambandhit, geet, kathaayen, lokoktiyaan, natya, bhashaa, tathaa paramparaayen, or inke abhipraay
 In another endeavor, the deity of Kinnaur is the main part of Aranyak sheep and goat farming, the main lifestyle there
 in sab baton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, ek itihaaskaar kii raay he ki sthaneey vikaas ke kaaryakramon main, lok chetana kii nirnay lene main bhoomika ho
 Under the second aspect are the studies in which traditional belief, diversity of supernatural elements, and changes in them were linked to mental health
 ashis nandi ke lekh main bharat ke taintis karod devi-devtaa jo chote-chote samoohon kii jivan shaileyon ke pratibimb hai, jinamein is badlaav ke sakshya in devi-devataaon ke bahari pratikon or paramparaon, tathaa jan maanas kii gaharaai main dekhe gaye
 Taking another reference, Sudhir Kakad did not decide the role of supernatural elements in mental health, in a country like India, by bringing spirituality gurus engaged in exorcism and the message of liberation, according to the ideology of psychoanalysis
 Also studied accurately
 man kii anya vichaardhaaraon, manochikitsa tathaa nrivigyaan, main hue adhyayan maansik swasthya main alokik tatwon kii sakaaratmak bhoomika ke pakshdhar hai
 The third aspect is in the context of discoveries in social biology and evolutionary psychology on traditional beliefs and local traditions
 madhav gadgil or unke saathiyon dwaara dev van kii pratha or iskaa jaivik smapda ke sangrakshan main yogadan kaa adhyayan, jaivik or saanskrithik, donon pakshon ko jodta he
 Complex and costly rituals involving supernatural elements were found useful in the development of cooperation in scientific discoveries
 jaigalatas or uske saathiyon ne, hinduon ke thapusam tyohaar main jatil or manhage anushthan karne vaale kwadi ke bhakton kii tulana saadhaaran bhakton se kii, kavadiyon main sahyog kii bhaavana zyada thi

 Small groups of people in the world, in which the image of the deity is in the person's mind as the supreme knowledgeable, punisher, and mortuary, is helpful in mutual cooperation

 Such action demonstrations, blockade, air, samudr, yaa sanyukt raashtra ke sadsy desh kii sena ne or anya kaaryon main shaamil hai saktaa he
 The second specific exception is found in Article 51, regarding the right to self-defense
 The article states that vartmaan charter main kuch bhi vyaktigat yaa samuhik aatmaraksha ke adhikaar nihit karaab agar ek sashastr The attack is against a member of the United Nations until the Security Council takes necessary measures antarrashtriya shanti or suraksha banaae rakhane ke liye le liya he karegaa Although NATO did not use force in Yugoslavia in support of the United Nations Security Council, neither did one duusare rajya ke khilaaf sashastr hui hamale kaa daawa he, iske adhivaktaaon kaa tark he ki apane kaaryon sanyukt The nations were in conformity with the Charter, claiming that the UN Charter was unreasonably banned but individual states condones se hi nato ke hamalon ke rup main kai rajyon ke sainya gathbandhan ne hamale akaaran

 transafarmar yaa parinamitra ek vaidyut mashin he jisamen koi chalane yaa ghoomane vaala avyav nahin hota
 The transformer is probably the most widely used electrical instrument in electrical equipment
 yah kisi ek vidyut paripath se anya paripath main vidyut preran dwaara paraspar jude hue chaalkon ke madhyam se vidyut urja sthantarit karata he
 The transformer can only work with alternating current or voltage, not with direct current
 transformar ek-feji, teen-feji yaa bahu-feji ho sakate he
 It is the most efficient machine among all electrical machines

 a transformer may have one, two or more windings
 do vinding vaale transafarmar ke praathmik evam dwitiyak vinding ke pheron kii sankhya evam unke vibhavantaron main nimnlikhit sambandh hota he: It is clear from this formula that by properly selecting the number of rounds of primary and secondary winding for a given value of primary voltage, we can get the desired voltage in the secondary winding
 jab dwitiyak vinding kaa vibhavaantar praathmik vinding ke vibhavaantar se adhik hota he to aise transpharmar ko ucchayi parinamitra kehete hai
 In contrast, when the voltage of the secondary winding is less than the voltage of the primary winding, such a transformer is called a catabolic transformer
 transafarmar kaa mukhya upyog vidyut shakti ko adhik voltata yaa kam voltata main badalanaa he 
 Doing so brings convenience and efficiency in the use of electrical energy
 dhyatavya he ki adarsh transafarmar urja yaa shakti utpann nahin karata, na hi shakti kaa parivartan karata he, na hi aavriti badalata he
 Transformer used in the field of electricity sambhavat: sarvaadhik vyapak rup se upyog main aanevaala Vaidyut is Sacritra

 In simplest form, the transformer consists of two separate coils, which have the same magnetic circuit
 shakti ke pravaah kii disha ke anusaar parinamitra ke kundalanon kaa abhinirdhaaran kiya jaataa he
 Connect the primary coil to the source of alternating current and the secondary to the load
 vidyucchumbakeey preran dwaara urja praathmik kundali se dwitiyak kundalan main sthanantarit hoti he
 The characteristics of operation of an ideal transformer are: vyavahaarat: yah adarsh sthiti dushprapya he
 The feed voltage associated with the primary coil of the transformer produces magnetic flux, which is connected to the plated core of the transformer
 parinamitra ke praathmik kundali se judi hui prayavarti voltata Ep ko ucchtam chumbakeey flux ke ghanatv Bm, patlit crode kii anuprastha kaat kaa kshetrafal A, prayavarti dhara kii aavrirti dhara kii aavriti f tathaa praathmik kundali main lapeton ko sankhya N1 ke padon main vyakt kiya jaataa he: The alternating magnetic flux generated by the current flowing in the primary coil also correlates with the wraps of the secondary coil
 praathmik or dwitiyak kundaliyon main antar keval lapeton kii sankhya kaa hota he, at: dwitiyak kundali main prerit voltata kaa prabhavi maan Thus the following ratio of primary and secondary voltage is obtained: praathmik kundali kii voltata ko badhaane ke aavashyaktaa padane par praathmik kundali main lapeton kii sakhya N1 ko dwitiyak kundali kii lapeton kii sankhya N2 se kam rakhaa jaataa he
 This type of transformer is called a high transformer and if the voltage of the primary coil is greater than the voltage of the secondary, then the number of wraps in the primary coil N1 will be larger than the number of wraps of the secondary coil N2
 is prakaar ke parinamitra ko apchaayi parinamitra kehete hai
 Generally the nature of the transformer is determined by the following: saamaanya lod par saadhaaran shakti parinamitra kii dakshata bahut adhik hoti he, jo chote uniton main 90 pratishat se lekar bade parinamitron main 98 pratishat tak vicharit hoti he
 General: The efficiency of the transformer expressed in percent can be expressed as: parinamitron kii taatkaalik dakshata or din bhar kii dakshata main antar hota he
 The control of the transformer means the relation of secondary voltage in the case of full load and secondary voltage in case of no load when the input voltage is constant
 pratishat ke rup main vyakt karne par niyantran ko adholikhit rup main paribhaashit kar sakate hai: Controls are of the order of 2 to 5 percent for small transformers and about 1 percent for elders
 transafarmar ke mukhyatah do bhaag hote hai: 1) Core - which is made of a magnetic material
 2) vinding - jo tanba, almunium yaa kisi anya suchalak ke taron athwa bas-baar se banaayi jaati he
 Apart from this, bad conductors are also used which prevent winding wheels from touching each other or from the core
 transformar tel kaa prayog ucch voltata ke parinamitron main kiya jaataa he jo brakedown shakti adhik hone se spark aadi rokte hai tathaa kor va kundliyon se ushma sokhkar use thanda karte hai
 Apart from oil and many other coolants are also used to keep the transformer cool, such as water and gas etc
