 Angrily, Blackstone compelled the university to fulfill its responsibilities by publishing a lengthy letter written in May 1757 to Thomas Randolph, the heir to Hadesford

 Given the financial state of the press, Kannan ceased to value scholarly books or even dictionaries as impossible liabilities
 unhone tippanee kii ki "mujhe nahin lagata ki vishvavidhyalay hamen barbaad karne ke liye paryaapt pustakon kaa nirmaan kar saktaa he"
 His efforts were greatly helped by the efficiency of the printing press

 Froud's agency was set up for a timely revised edition, published on 17 May 1881, and sold one million copies at an alarming rate before and after publication, although in the end it was in profit due to excessive production Decreased

 Froud controlled most of the operating mechanisms for oup's print books, including dealing with authors, book binding, distribution, and advertising, and only the editorial work and printing work was handled by Oxford
 fraud oxford ko niyamit rup se paise bhejte the lekin unhone nijee taur par mahasoos kiya ki is vyavsaay kii puunji kaaphi kam thi or agar ise ek vanijyik aadhaar nahin mila to yah bahut jald vishvavidhyalay ke sanshadhano ko khaali kar degaa

 But Froud's distance from the press's decision meant that he was unable to influence this policy unless a representative favored him

 Cassell, considered blasphemously a commercial firm by GAIL representatives, was making a name for himself in a publishing firm called Petter & Galpin
 gail khud ek kuleen vyakti the jo apane kaam se naakhush the jahaan unhone khud ko 'ek varg: nimna madhya' ke swaad ke liye khanpan kaa intjaam karte hue paaya or unhone oupi dwaara aakarshith pathakon or granthon ke saath kaam karne ke maukey kaa phayda uthaaya
 Jowett promised Gayle golden opportunities, some of which he also had the right to provide
 unhone gail kii niyukti ko lambii chuttee or mark patison kii maut ke samay main hi nirdhaarit kiya isliye sambhavit vipakshi mahatvapurn baithkon main bhaag na le sake
 Jowett knew very well why Gayle would be opposed because he had never worked for the press, nor was he a representative, and had lost his career in the city by his raw knowledge of commerce
 unka dar dur hua
 Gail immediately proposed a complete modernization of the press with a marked lack of tact and gave rise to permanent enemies for himself
 phir bhi unhone fraud ke saath milakar bahut kuch kiya or 1898 tak prakaashan kaaryakramon or oupi kii pahunch kaa vistaar kiya
 After that, due to the non-cooperation of the delegates, their health deteriorated due to the impossible working conditions faced by them

 In his view, the press was a consortium of scholars and it will always be so
 Gayle's idea of 'skill' appeared to be in violation of that culture, although a similar reform program was later put into practice from the inside

 Both were Oxford men who were familiar with its inside-out system and the close collaboration with which they worked was the result of their shared background and worldview

 Whatever be the reason for his style of working, both Cannan and Milford had a very rigorous and practical approach required to work and he took his step forward to make this work
 In fact, within a few weeks of Milford entering the London office, Froud found out that he would be replaced
 However, Milford always dealt with Froud dearly and Froud remained in an advisory capacity until 1913

 Not all of them were full-fledged branches: there was a depot in Leipzig run by H

 The press experienced World War II like the First World War, the only difference being that Milford was now about to retire and that he 'hated the movement of young people'
 This time the air invasion in London was very dangerous and the London business was temporarily shifted to Oxford

 Cobb assigns a man named Steer to travel to Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile and possibly other countries whose responsibility was on Cobb
 hoder and stafaton is udhyam se baahar nikal gaya lekin oupi ne aage badhkar isamen apana yogadan diya
 Steer's visit was a disaster, and Milford stated in sad words that the trip proved to be 'quite expensive and far less fruitful' than all the passengers' trips
 Steer returned before completing more than half of his itinerary, and while returning he failed to return his customers' payments resulting in the press losing a hefty £ 210
 The press was forced to pay 80 per cent of the value of its books as an 'incidental expense', so they suffered losses despite getting enough orders
 In fact some orders were received from the trip itself, and when the steer's nominal box was returned, the London office discovered that they had not been opened from the second layer downwards

 The Oxford History of Music containing several volumes of Sir William Henry Haddo appeared between 1901 and 1905
 haalanki is tarah sangeet prakaashan udhyam bahut kam the: "unnisvin sadi main oxford main is vichaar ko mahatv nahin diya jaataa tha ki sangeet kisi arth main shaikshik ho sakati he" or kuch pratinidhi yaa purv prakaashak khud sangeet se sambandhit the yaa unki prishthbhumi kaaphi had tak sangeet se sambandhit thi
 However, Milford enjoyed music in the London office and was particularly concerned with the world of church and church musicians
 1921 main mileford ne huebert je

 In that work Foss introduced his energy and imagination
 haalanki satakliff ke anusaar ek saadhaaran sangeetkaar or pratibhashali pianovadak ke rup main phos "kii ruchi khaas taur se shiksha main nahin thi; sangeet main unki gahari ruchi thi
 Milford probably considered it less related to music than education when Fos reported to Milford about plans to publish a group of composers of well-known musicians on composers of frequently played radio
 Will happen
 There is no clear record of the thought process by which the press may have ventured into the field of music publishing
 Foss's presence and his knowledge, abilities, enthusiasm and imagination may have served as a catalyst in Milford's mind, giving rise to several unrelated activities that gave rise to another new venture, like the establishment of overseas branches
 ho saktaa he ki mileford ko puri tarah yah baat samaj main nahin ai hogi ki vah kya kar rahe the
 The booklet, published in 1973 by the Music Department on the fiftieth anniversary, shows that OUP "had no knowledge of the music trade and had no representative to sell his compositions in his music shops, and it seems likely that he Also, there was no illusion that sheet music was in any way a separate thing from books
 " haalanki mileford ne jaanboojhkar yaa anjaane main teen kadam uthaae jisase oupi ne ek pramukh kaary kaa shubharambh kiya
 He purchased the anglo-french Music Company and all its centers, related goods and resources
 unhone sangeet ke liye ek purnakalik bikri prabandhak ke rup main norman peterkin naamak ek sanyamee mashhoor sangitajna ko kaam par rakh liya
 And in 1923 he set up a separate effects music department with offices in Amen House and Faus was the first music editor
 uske baad saamaanya samarthan ke alaava mileford ne phos ko bade paimaane par unke apane upkarnon ke hawaale kar diya
 Foss responded with incredible energy
 unhone "sabase kam sambhavit samay main sabase badi sambhavit suchi" kaa nirmaan kiya or lagbhag 200 sheershak prati varsh kii dar se usamen sheershakon shaamil karnaa shuru kar diya; aath saal baad us suchi main 1750 sheershak the
 In the year of the founding of the department, Foss began producing a series of inexpensive but well edited and printed choreographers under the title "oxford Choral Songs"

 The series plan was expanded to include similar inexpensive but high-quality "oxford Church Music" and "tudor Church Music"; All of these series continue to this day

 Scholes' continuing works designed for OUP to keep pace with the development of broadcast and recorded music and his other works in the field of journalistic music criticism would later be widely integrated and abstracted into the Oxford Companion to Music
 shaayad sabase mahatvapurn baat yah he ki phos ko shaayad un rachanaaon ke nae sangeetkaaron kii talash karne kii aadat thi jin rachanaaon ko vah vishisht rup se angrezi sangeet kii manyata dete the jo janata ko adhik priy thi
 As a result of this concentration, OUP received two mutually reinforcing advantages: a chance to enter the field of music publishing while remaining occupied by potential competitors, and a branch for music performance and production that until now was largely ignored by the British themselves
 Was being done hinels ke prastaav eke mutabik kaaphi had tak agyaat vanijyik sambhaavnaaon vaale sangeet ke kshetra main sangeet vibhaag kaa aarambhik "chaatravrutti evam saanskrithik rashtrawaad mishran" isaki saanskrithik paroapkaar kii bhaavana or "german mukhyadhara ke baahar rashtriya sangeet" ko badhaava dene kii ichha se prerit tha
 As a result, Foss began actively promoting the work and expressed a desire to publish music by Ralph Vaughan Williams, William Walton, Constant Lambert, Alan Rawthorne, Peter Warlock, Edmund Rubbra and other English composers
 jis sandarbh main press ko "aadhunik sangeet ke itihaas ke sabase tikaoo sajjan samjhauta" kaha gaya us sandarbh main phos ne aisi kisi bhi sangeet ke prakaashan kii guarantee di jise vughan williams unhen pradaan karnaa chahenge
 iske alaava, phos ne oupi ke keval sangeet ke prakaashan or jeevant pradarshan ke adhikaron ko hi nahin balki recording or broadcast ke "yantric" adhikaron ko bhi surakshit karne kii disha main kadam uthaaya
 yah baat puri tarah se spasht nahin thi ki us samay yah sab kitna mahatvapurn sabit hua hoga
 In fact, Foss, OUP, and many musicians had previously refused to join or support the Performing Right Society, because they feared that such fees would have a bad impact on such performances in new media
 In later years it was observed that such music, on the contrary, proved to be more attractive than the traditional sites of music publishing
 sangeet kii peshkash ke pariman or vistaar kii drushti se or sangitagnon or aam janata donon ke dilon main isaki pratishtha kii drushti se sangeet ke vibhaag ne chaahe jaisaa bhi vikaas kiya ho, 1930 ke dashak main aakhirkaar vittiya pratifal kaa sawaal sabase pramukh tha
 As a London publisher, Milford gave his full support to the music department over the years of its creation and development
 haalanki un par lagaataar hone vaale kharchon se chintit oxford ke pratinidhiyon kaa dabaav badhane laga jo unhen ek laabhhin udhyam lag rahaa tha
 According to him, the operation of Amen House was educationally honorable and financially beneficial

" iske alaava, oupi apane pustak prakashnon ko alpakaaleen pariyojnaayen maanata tha: prakashit hone ke kuch varshon ke bheetar na bikne vaali kisi bhi pustak ko bazaar se waapas mangava liya jaataa tha

 The delegates did not agree with Foss's view: "I still think that the word 'loss' is a false word: is it not really an investment of capital?" This sentence was written by Foss to Milford in 1934
 is prakaar 1939 tak sangeet vibhaag main kisi bhi varsh koi munafa nahin dikhaai diya
 By then, the economic pressures of the recession, as well as the internal pressures to reduce spending, and possibly the academic background of the Oxford parent body, together gave rise to oup's primary music business, whose mainstay of publishing compositions was formal music education and music appreciation
 Which in a way was an effect of broadcasting and recording itself
 yah british skulon kii sangeet shiksha kii sahaayak samagriyon kii badhati maang ke saath acchhee tarah se mail kha rahaa tha jo 1930 ke dashak main shiksha ke kshetra main sarkari sudhaaron kaa parinaam tha
 The press did not stop searching for new musicians and their music and publishing them, but the nature of business had changed
 vyaktigat swasthya samasyaon se peedit or aarthik baadhaon or kagaz kii kami se tang aakar or da blitz se bachane ke liye landan ke sabhi kaary-sanchaalan tantron ko oxford sthanantarit kiye jane se bahut zyada naaraaz hokar, phos ne 1941 main apane pad se istipha de diya or unki jagah peterkin ko rakhaa gaya

 jinna kaa maananaa tha ki sirf sanvaidhanik sangharsh se hi aazaadee pai ja sakati he
 
 Unlike other Congress leaders, Gandhiji did not wear foreign clothes, used Hindi more and more in place of English and Sanatan used Hindu thinking in politics
 yahi kuch kaaran the ki gandhiji ko apaar lokapriyata mili

 jinna ne congress ko gathbandhan ke liye aamantrit kiya
 At first they both decided that they would face the British together, but Jinnah stipulated that the Congress would have to consider a separate constituency for Muslims and the Muslim League as representative of the Muslims of India, which the Congress rejected
 congress main us samay kai muslim netaa the, isliye lig ko bhartiya musalamaanon kaa pratinidhi maananaa uske liye aasaan nahin tha

 After negotiations with the Congress failed, Jinnah also got the idea that Muslims should have to find a separate country to protect their rights without it working
 aage chalakar jinna kaa yah vichaar bilkul pakkaa ho gaya ki hindu or musalmaan donon alag-alag desh ke naagarik hai at: unhen alahada kar diya jaye

 He married his second daughter, Olit, to King Sigurd of Orkney and married his middle daughter Donada to King Finlay of Morai

 Some of the major identities of vector calculus are given below
 kisi sadish kshetra v { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {v} } ke liye, divergence praayah nimnlikhit prakaar se likhaa jaataa he: For a tensor t { \ displaystyle { \ stackrel { \ mathbf { \ mathfrak {T}}} {}}}, divergence is usually written as follows: kisi sadish kshetra v { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {v} } ke liye, karl is prajkaar likhaa jaataa he: For a vector field v { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {v}}, the gradient is usually written as: kisi adish kshetra, ψ { \ displaystyle \ psi } ke liye, gradient is prakaar likhaa jaataa he: The curl of the gradient of any scalar field φ { \ displaystyle \ \ phi} is always zero: One way to establish this identity is to use three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates
 According to the article on curl, where the right hand side is a determinant, and i, j, k are unit vectors pointing in the positive axes directions, and ∂x = ∂ / ∂ x etc
 For example, the x-component of the above equation is: where the left-hand side evaluates as zero assuming the order of differentiation is immaterial
 The divergence of the curl of any vector field a is always zero: The Laplacian of a scalar field is defined as the divergence of the gradient: Note that the result is a scalar quantity
 In simpler form, using Feynman subscript notation: where the notation ∇A means the subscripted gradient operates on only the factor A
 a less general but similar idea is used in geometric algebra where the so-called Hestenes overdot notation is employed
 The above identity is then expressed as: where overdots define the scope of the vector derivative
 In the first term it is only the first factor that is differentiated, while the second is held constant
 Likewise, in the second term it is the second factor that is differentiated, and the first is held constant
 As a special case, when a = B: where the Feynman subscript notation ∇B means the subscripted gradient operates on only the factor b
in overdot notation, explained above: The gradient of the product of two scalar fields ψ { \ displaystyle \ psi } and φ { \ displaystyle \ phi } follows the same form as the Product rule in single variable Calculus

 Swami Rambhadracharya's reply in the reply was that he only edited the prevalent copies of the Manas, not the original Manas
 yah vivaad tab shant hua jab swami rambhadracharya ne akhaada parishad ko ek patr likhakar unke pahunche ksht or pidaa par khed prakat kiya
 In the letter, Rambhadracharya requested the Akhara Parishad to accept only the old copies and not the other copies

 During World War II, in 1942, an armed force called the Azad Hind Fauj or Indian National Army was formed to free India from British occupation

 In the beginning, Indian soldiers who were made prisoners of war were taken in this army

 a year later, in June 1943, Subhash Chandra Bose announced from Tokyo radio that it was absolutely futile to expect the British to leave their own empire

 The Jataka or Jataka Pali or Jataka stories are the 10th part of the Khuddakanikaya under the Sutpitaka of the Buddhist scripture Tripitaka
 in kathaon main mahatma buddha ke purv janmon kii kathayen hai
 Which is believed to have been told by Gautam Buddha himself, although some scholars believe that some Jataka stories have been told by his disciples after Gautam Buddha
 vishwa kii pracheenatam likhit kahaniyaan jataka kathaayen hai jisamen lagbhag 600 kahaniyaan sangrah kii gayi he
 This is an event dating back 300 years
 in kathaon main manoranjan ke madhyam se niti or dharm ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya gaya he
 The Jataka is the tenth famous text of the Khadak body
 jataka ko vastutah granth na kahkar granth samooh hi kahana adhik upyukt hoga
 Some of his plot is in the form of a complete book and sometimes his stories are in the form of brief epics
 jataka shabd jan dhaatu se bana he
 It means past or emotion
 ‘jan’ dhaatu main ‘kt’ pratyay jodakar yah shabd nirmit hota he
 When metal is used in the ghost sense, when the meaning is done, then the story and form are created
 bhav arth main prayukt karne par jaat-jani-janan-janm arth banataa he
 In this way, the meaning of the word 'jataka' is 'jat' meaning birth-related
 ‘jataka’ bhagwaan buddha ke purv janm sambandhi kathaayen he
 God Buddha is called Bodhisattva before he attains enlightenment
 ve us samay buddhatv ke liye ummidavaar hote hai or daan, sheel, maitri, satya aadi das parmitaaon athwa paripurnataaon kaa abhyaas karte hai
 They sacrifice their lives many times for the sake of spirituality
 is prakaar ve buddhatv kii yogyata kaa sampaadan karte hai
 The word Bodhisattva itself means industrial beings for Bodhi
 bodhi ke liye he satv jiskaa aisa arth bhi kuch vidwaanon ne kiya he
 In the Pali Sutras, we read many times, "before attaining enlightenment, at the time of not being Buddha, when i was a Bodhisattva", etc
 atah bodhisattva se spasht taatpary gyaan, satya dayaa aadi kaa abhyaas karne vaale us sadhak se he jiskaa aage chalakar buddha hona nishchit he
 Lord Buddha had not only been a Bodhisattva in his last birth before the state of enlightenment, but he also followed the Bodhisattva practice in many of his earlier births
 jataka kii kathaayen bhagavan buddha ke in vibhinn purvajanmon se jabaki ve bodhisattva rahe the, sambandhit hai
 He is portrayed as the protagonist in most stories
 kahani ke ve swayan nayak he
 Sometimes his place is secondary as an ordinary character and sometimes he is depicted as a spectator
 praayah prayek kahani kaa armbh is prakaar hota he-‘‘ek samay raja brahmadatt ke varanasi main rajya karte samay bodhisattva kurang mrug kii yoni se utpann hue athwa

bodhisattva goh kii yoni sein utpann hue aadi, aadi
 Some of the Jataka stories have been named from the first words of the saga that came in the Jataka, namely - Apataka Jataka; According to one's protagonist, vānupath jātaka; According to the births of the Bodhisattva, such as Nigradh Mig Jataka, Machta Jataka, etc
 sabhi jataka kathaayen gautamabuddha ke dwaara kahi gayi he, jataka buddha samaykalin he, jaatakon kii nishchit sankhya kitni he, iskaa nirnay karnaa bada kathin he
 According to the custom prevalent in Lanka, Burma and Siam, the Jataka are 550
 samantapasadika kii nidaan katha main bhi jaatakon kii sankhya itani hi bataai gai he
 '' Panasa Dhakani Panchasatani Jatakanti Veditabb
 ‘‘ atthasalini kii nidaan katha main bhi -pannasadhikani panchajatakasatani‘‘ he
 The number is broadly fixed
 jataka ke vartmaan rup main 547 jataka kahaniyaan pai jaati hai
 But this number is also only upper
 jatakatthawannanakaar ne vishaywastu kii drushti se inhen paanch virgon main vibhajit kiya he- Many of the Jataka stories are also found in two places with little variation or have been embedded in each other, and likewise many Jataka stories are found in sutta-pitaka, vinaya-pitaka, and other Pali texts, but In the present form of Jataka is not stored
 atah jaatakon kii sankhya main kaaphi kami kii bhi or briddhi kii bhi sambhaavna he
 For example, the story of Munik Jataka and Saluk Jataka is same, but only two names have come from different places
 iske vipareet ‘munik jataka’ naam ke do jataka hote hue unki bhi katha bhinn-bhinn he
 This is also the case for two people named Machh Jataka
 kahi-kahin do swatantra jaatakon ko milakar ek tisare jataka kaa nirmaan kar diya gaya he
 For example, both the Panchapandit Jataka and the Dakarakkhas Jataka are inhabited by the Maha Ummag Jataka
 jo kathaayen jataka-katha ke rup main anyatra pai jaati hai, kintu ‘jataka’ main sangruhit nahin he, unka bhi kuch ullekh kar dena aavashyak hoga
 Ghatikar of the Majjhim body- Sutta or Ghatika and Sutta is one such Jataka story which is not found in 'jataka'
 isi prakaar dirghanikaay kaa mahagovind sutt jo swayan jataka kii nidaan katha main bhi ‘mahagovind jataka’ ke naam se nirdisht hua he, jataka ke andar nahin paaya jaataa he
 Similarly, in Dhammapadatthakatha and Milind Panha, some such Jataka-stories are quoted, which are not stored in Jataka
 atah kuch jataka nishchit rup se kitne he iskaa thik nirnay nahin ho saktaa
 When we consider the number of the Jataka, the Jataka means a story with a special title, which describes the life-related event of the Bodhisattva, no matter how many different stories are interwoven in that one
 Are given
 yadi kul kahaniyaan gini jaay to jataka main kareeb teen hajaar kahaniyaan pai jaati hai
 The Jatakas have in fact been compiled on the basis of sutta-pitaka and vinaya-pitaka
 sutt -pitak main anek aisi kathaayen he jinka upyog vahaan upadesh dene ke liye kiya gaya he
 But the Bodhisattva is not mentioned in it
 yah kaam baad main karke prayek kahani ko jataka kaa rup de diya gaya he
 Tittir Jataka and Dighit Kosal Jataka are similarly constructed from Chullavagg and Mahavagga respectively of vinaya-pitaka
 manikanth jataka bhi vinay-pitak par hi aadhaarit he
 Similarly, the Kootadanta Sutta and Mahasudassana Sutta of the long-body and the Makhadeva Sutta of the Majjhim body are also Jataka in full sense
 kam se kam 13 jaatkaan kii khoj vidwaanon ne sutt pitak or vinay-pitak main kii hai
 Although the stories related to Rajkatha chor-katha and similar fears, war, village, corporation, city, district, women, panaghat, ghost and ghost etc
 were seen in terms of helplessness in the monk's union by calling it sordid stories
 phir bhi upadesh ke liye kathaon kaa upyog bhikshu log kuch-na-kuch maatra main karte hi the
 God himself has also preached religion through similes and parables
 buddha sanskrit granth saddharmpundaree sutara ke dwitiya parivart main bhi kaha gaya he ki buddha anek drushtaanton se tathaa jataka ke dwaara sab praaniyon ke kalyanarth upadesh karte hai
 Apart from Buddha, other Indian saints have been preaching religions with the help of fables and parables from the time of the Upanishads to the time of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa
 isi pravriti ke aadhaar par jatakakathaon kaa vikaas hua he
 The stories prevalent in public society have also been taken somewhere, but they have been given a new moral form, which is a feature of Buddhism
 atah sabhi jataka kathaon par buddha dharm kii puri chhap he
 They may have the basis of folk lectures from earlier traditions, but their entire structure is compatible with the moral ideal of Buddhism
 buddha vachanon kaa vargeekaran nau angon ke rup main kiya gaya he, jinke naam hai- This nine types of division of the Buddha verses is only in terms of their style forms or patterns, not in terms of texts
 itane prakaar ke buddha upadesh hote the, yahi is vargeekaran kaa abhipraay he
 The division of the Buddha's verses into nine parts of which the number of Jataka is seventh is very ancient
 atah jataka kathaayen sarvansh main pali-sahitya ke mahatvapurn evam aavashyak ang hai
 Uncertainty about their numbers has arisen, especially due to their timely collection of Sutta Pitaka and vinaya-pitaka and other sources, and their own assortment of Pali Pitaka and their intermingling
 chull niddes main hamen keval 500 jaatakon kaa kaa ullekh miltaa he
 In the fifth century AD, Chinese traveler Fahyan saw pictures of 500 natives printed in Lanka
 dwitiya tritiy shatabdi isvi purv ke bharhut or sanchi ke stupon main jaatakon ke chitra ankit mili hai
 Out of which pictures of at least 27 or 29 natives were identified by Rais Davids
 tab se kuch anya jataka kahaniyon kii pahchaan bhi in stupon kii pashaan-veshtoniyon par kii ja chuki hai
 All these facts are indicative of the ancientness and development of the native
 sthaviravaadi pali sahitya ke samaan sanskrit buddha dharm ke granthon main bhi jataka kathaayen pai jaati hai
 Like the Nawang Buddha word of Pali, Dwad Sh Anga here is considered to be the scripture
 in donon hi jagah jataka ek ang yaa dharm-pravachan ke bhaag ke rup main vidyaman he
 In the Buddhist Sanskrit text Jatakamala, which is told the composition of Aryasur, 34 Jataka stories are found
 aryashur ko lamas, tarnath ne ashwaghosh kaa hi doosraa naam bataaya he parantu yah thik nahin jaan padataa he
 Probably he was a poet of the fourth century AD
 lokottaravaadiyon ke prasiddh granth mahavastu main jo 200 i0 purv se 400 i0 tak ke bich ke kaal main likhi gai, kareeb 80 jataka kathaayen milti he
 Some of them are similar to Pali Jataka and there are also some that are not found in Pali Jataka
 rais davids kaa kathan he ki jataka kaa sankalan or pranayan madhya desh main pracheen janakathaon ke aadhaar par hua
 Winternitz has also often expressed this view
 adhikansh jataka buddhakalin he
 The inscriptions of Sanchi and Bharhut's scenes on the stone-vestas give ample evidence of their pre-ashoka period
 jataka ke kaal or kartrutv ke sambandh main adhik prakaash uske saahitiyik rup or visheshtaon ke vivechan se padegaa
 Each Jataka tale is divided into five parts
 panchuppannavatthu kaa arth he vartmaan kaal kii ghatana yaa katha
 The incident that took place during the lifetime of Buddha is Pachauppannavatthu
 us ghatana ne bhagwaan ko kisi purvajanm ke vrut t ko kehane kaa avasar diya
 This is the circle of the past life is past
 prayek jataka kaa katha kii drushti sabase adhik mahatvapurn bhaag yah atitvatthu hi he
 According to this, Pachappannavatthu seems to have been built somewhere
 atitvatthu ke baad ek yaa anek gaathaayen aati hai
 Although they are related to the past only, but in some cases it is also related to the Pachappannavattu
 gaathaayen jataka ke pracheenatam ansh hai
 In fact only the gatakas are native
 pacchuppannavatthu aadi paanch bhaagon se samanvit jataka to vastav main jatakatthawannana yaa jataka main veyyakaran yaa atthav nnana aati he
 It contains interpretations and semantics of gathas
 sabase ant main samodhan aata he, jisamen atitvatthu ke paatro kaa buddha ke jivan kaal ke paatro ke saath sambandh milaayaa jaataa he, yatha us samay ataari par se shikaar khilne vaala shikari ab kaa dev dutt tha or kurung mrug to main tha hi, aadi aadi
 The Jataka contains the stories of the earlier births of the Buddha, while he completed various traditions in the form of the Bodhisattva and perfected his ability for enlightenment
 sutt-pitak ke pratham chaar nikaayon main buddha ke aitihaasik rup kii hi pratishtha he
 Later in the Jataka, they are able to relate their historical life to the earlier stories
 jatakatthakatha kii nidaan katha main buddha jivan ke teen nidaan bataaye gayi hai, duure nidaan main atyant dur ateet kii buddha jivan kii katha he, aisa mana jaataa he ki atyant sudur ateet main buddha sumedh tapasvi banakar utpann hue the
 At that time he showed great loyalty to Dipankar Buddha, as a result he later blessed him to be Buddha
 anek janmon tak vibhinn sharir dhaaran karte hue sume dha tapasvi kii sadhana chalati rahi
 In the end, after leaving his body as Vesantar king, he went to the illiterate world
 sumedh tapasvi ke rup se lekar tushit lok main jane tak kii buddha kii yah sadhana katha dur nidaan ke antargat he
 547 Jataka stories are related to this second diagnosis of Buddha biography from Apanaka Jataka to Vesantara Jataka
 in kathaon se yahan taatpary he inamen varnit atitvatthu
 They are related to the short diagnosis of the life story of Buddha i
e
 these are the stories of the past
 lumbini van main janm lene ke samay se lekar bodhi-prapti tak kii katha avidure nidaan se sambandhit he
 That is, she is not so far away from the past
 bodhi prapti se lekar nirvana prapti tak kii buddha jeevani santike nidaan ke antargat he
 That is, she is near
 jataka kii pacchuppannavatthu main iske kuch ansh prastaavna rup main aate hai
 The stories of the Jataka include the stories of his past births contained within the second diagnosis of Buddha biography in the past
 aitihaasik buddha ke jivan kii kisi ghatana kaa ullekh kar in duure nidaan kii kathaon ke kehane ke liye avkaash nikaal liya gaya he
 Whatever it is actually creates the native
 prayek jataka ke paanch angon ke uparyukt vivechan se spasht he ki jataka gadhy-padya mishrit rachanaayen hai
 The saga part is considered to be the oldest part of the native
 tripitak ke antarbhoot is gaatha bhaag ko hi maananaa adhik upyukt hoga
 The rest is fiction
 parantu jataka-kathaon kii prakruti aisi he ki mul ko vyakhya se alag kar dene par kuch bhi samaj main nahin aa saktaa
 Only the stories do not create the story
 unke upar jab vartmaan or ateet kii ghatnaon ko dhaanchaa chadhaaya jaataa he tabhi kathavstu kaa nirmaan hota he
 Therefore, it is necessary to have the above five elements in the whole Jataka, in which all except the saga-part is its explanation, the latter is added
 phir bhi suvidha ke liye or aitihaasik drushti se galat dhang par ham uskon jataka kah dete hai
 In fact, the collection of 547 Jataka tales which are coordinated with the above mentioned five organs, we should not say Jatakattvavana or Jatakathakatha, rather than Jataka
 phosbal or kowal ne jiskaa kramshah roman lipi main or angreji main sampaadan or anuwaad kiya he yaa hindi main bhadant anand kausalyayan ne ‘jataka’ sheershak se 6 bhaagon main anuvaa da kiya he, vah vastav main jataka na hokar jataka kii vyakhya he
 The Jataka tales are basically only gathas, the rest is its interpretation
 gaatha or jataka ke shesh bhaag kaa kalkram aadi kii drushti se kya parsparik sambandh he yah prashn saamne aata he
 In the legend, the story has been called Abhinambabuddha saga or stories sung by Lord Buddha
 ve buddhavachan hai
 Therefore, she was a part of Tipitak and compiled from there, a structure of stories has been presented on her
 sampoorn jataka granth kii vishaywastu kaa jis aadhaar par vargeekaran hua he, usase bhi yahi spasht he ki gaatha-bhaag, yaa jise pinternitj aadi vidwaanon ne gaatha-jataka kaha he, vahiin uskaa muladhar he
 The classification of the Jataka text is based on the number of gathas and not on the basis of subject matter
 ther-theri gaathaon ke samaan vah bhi nipaton main vibhakt he
 The native has 22 falls
 pehle nipaat main 150 aisi kathaayen he jinamein ek kii ek gaatha pai jaati he
 There are 150 Jataka stories in the second fall, but two stories are found in each story
 isi prakaar tisare or chauthe nipaat main pachaas-pachaas kathaayen he or gaathaon kii sankhya kramshah teen-teen or chaar-chaar he
 Further, the same sequence often continues till the thirteenth fall
 chaudaaven nipaat kaa naam pakinnak nipaat he
 The number of gathas in this fall is varied from 14 to not according to the rules
 isliye iskaa naam pakinnak rakh diya gaya he
 10 stories are also found in some stories in this nipati and up to 47 in some stories
 aage ke nipaton main gaathaon kii sankhya nirantar badhati gai he
 The title of the fifteenth ninth is Vis Nispat, Tis Nispat of the sixteenth, forty-nine Nishat of the seventeenth, Panas Nishat of the eighteenth, Sixty Nishat of the nineteenth, Sattinipat of the twentieth and Assinipatam of the twenty-seventh
 bisen nipaat main keval das jataka kathaayen he kintu prayek main gaathaon kii sankhya sau se bhi upar he
 The number of gathas in the last person is above seven hundred
 in sabase yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki jataka kathaon kii aadhaar gaathaayen hi he
 In the interpreting part of many Jataka stories themselves, the distinction between Pali and Atthakatha is shown, as in many other books of Pali Sutras and also in the texts of Visuddhimagga
 jahaan tak jataka ke veyyakaran bhaag se sambandh he, vahaan pali kaa arth tipitak gat gaatha hi ho saktaa he
 From the evidence of language, the saga part is more ancient than the prose section
 pinternitj ne kaha he jataka kii sampoorn gaathaon ko tipitak kaa mul ansh nahin mana ja saktaa he
 There is also a distinction between them
 swayan jataka ke vargeekaran se hi yah spasht he
 In the fourteenth fall, the number of stories of each Jataka tale is not very much 14 as per the rules - somewhere is very high
 isi prakaar biswein nipaat main uski do jataka kathaon kii sankhya sattar-sattar na hokar kramshah 92 or 93 he
 It has been concluded that the original number of the Jatakas or the saga of the Jatakas will be the same as the number of the title of Nipat
 or baad main uskaa sanvardhan kiya gaya he
 So some of the saga is more ancient and some is relatively less ancient
 isi prakaar gadhy bhaag bhi kuch atyant pracheenta ke lakshan liye hue he or kuch apekshaakrit arvachin he
 There is no resemblance between prose and saga part in some people and there is a lot of variation in the style anywhere
 is sabase jataka ke sankalanaatmak rup or uske bhashaaroop kii vividhta par prakaash padataa he jisamen kai rachayitaaon yaa sankalankartaaon or kai shatabdiyon kaa yoga rahaa he
 The antiquity of the Jataka stories is undeniable, most of its prose is also very ancient
 bharhut or sanchi ke stupon kii pashaan veshtoniyon par jo chitra ankit he ve jataka ke gadhy bhaag se hi sambandhit hai
 Therefore, most of the prose part of Jataka which is ancient, in the third, second century BCE must be so popular that it can be made the basis of craftsmanship
 atah saamanytah ham jataka ko buddhakalin bhartiya samaaj or samskruti kaa pratik maan sakate hai
 Some of the signs and stages depicted in it are also from prague-buddhist India and some are from the post-buddha era
 jahaan tak gaathaon kii vyakhya or unke shabdaarth kaa samb ndh he, vah sambhavtah jataka kaa sab se adhik arvachin ansh he
 The author of this excerpt is considered Acharya Buddha Ghosh
 ‘gandhavans’ ke anusaar acharya buddhaghosh ne hi ‘jatakatthannana’ kii rachana kii, kintu yah sandigdh he
 While showing a variation of language style and giving some other prohibitive reasons, Dr
 T
 W
 Royce Davids does not consider Buddhaghosha to be the author or compiler of the Jatakattavavana
 swayan jatakatthakatha ke upodghaat main lekhak ne apana parichay dete hue kaha he ‘‘ xxrep 4 
 shantchitt pandit buddhamitt bhikshu buddhadev ke kehane se xxrep 8 
 vyakhya karunga
 The Mahishasak sect was a Buddhist sect unlike the Mahavihara tradition
 buddhaghosh ne jitani atthakathaayen likhi he, shuddh mahaviharavasi bhikshuon kii upadesh vidhi par aadhaarit hai
 Therefore, it is not right to associate the author of the scripture with Acharya Buddhaghosh
 sambhavtah yah koi anya sinhalai bhikshu the, jinka kaal paanchavin shatabdi isvi mana ja saktaa he
 It contains the following stories: tripitak The Jataka tales relate to the past births of Lord Buddha
 bodhisattva kii charyaaon kaa unamem varnan he
 So, they are all usually didactic
 parantu unka saahitiyik rup bhi nikharaa hua he
 Despite being didactic, he is artistic in its entire sense
 jataka ke aadi main nidaan-katha he, jisame bhagavan buddha ke pehle 24 budhon ke vivaran ke saath-saath bhagwaan gautam buddha kii jeevani letvan vihaar ke daan kii sweekruti tak di gai he
 The summary of some Jataka tales and the form of their subject matter is as follows

 Jataka tales form folk-literature
 usamen pashu-pakshiyon aadi kii kathaayen bhi he or manushyon kii bhi he
 The plot of the natives is of various types
 vinternitj ne mukhyatah saat bhaagon main unka vargeekaran kiya he- The styles of description also vary
 vinternitj ne inkaa vargeekaran paanch bhaagon main is prakaar kiya he
 Vanarind Jataka, Villarwat Jataka, Sihachamm Jataka, Sunsumar Jataka, and Sandhibdha Jataka etc
 jataka kathaayen pashu-kathaayen he
 These stories are very important
 visheshtah inhen kathaon kaa gaman videshon main hua he
 The cast of satire is also seen here in its poetic form
 praayah pashuon kii tulana main manushyon ko hin dikhaaya gaya he
 One special thing is that satire has been done on the entire caste and not on any person
 ek bandar kuch dinon ke liye manushyon ke bich aakar rahaa
 Later turns to his teammates
 saathi poochhate he-‘‘manushyon ke samaaj main rahe he
 They know their behavior
 hamen bhi kahen
 We want to hear that
 ‘‘ manushyon kii kerani mujhase mat pucho
 Say, we want to listen
 bandar ne kahana shuru kiya,‘‘ hiranya meraa! sona meraa! yahi raat din ve chillaate he
 Two people live in the house
 ek ko munch nahin hoti

 use bahut dhan se kharida jaataa he
 He hurts all the people
 ‘‘ bandar kah hi rahaa tha ki uske saathiyon ne kaan band kar liye‘‘ mat kahen mat kahen‘‘
 Many pictures of this kind of melodious and unique satire will be found in the native

 In Mahapingal Jataka, in relation to the popularity of Brahmins, in Sigal Jataka, in relation to a very intelligent ascetic, Avariya is in Jataka

 Like Buddhist literature, the Jataka has an important place in the overall Indian literature and not only that, in the whole world literature

 It is a link connecting Mahayana and Hinayana, because the Bodhisattva ideal of Mahayana exists here in its seed-form
 duusari-teesri shatabdi isvi purv ke sanchi or bharhut ke stupon main jataka ke anek drishy ankit he
 Many Jataka tales have been quoted in Milindphan
 amravati stupa dwitiya shatabdi isvi main uske chitra ankit he
 In the fifth century, 500 scenes were recorded in Lanka
 ajanta kii chitrakaari main bhi mahis jataka ankit he

 Therefore, the importance of Jataka is not only in India, outside India also Stalism is not only important in Buddhism but also in many other forms of Buddhism
 kalkram kii drushti se vaidic sahitya kii shunagashep kii katha yama-yami samvaad, pururava urvashi samvaad aadi kathanak hi buddha purv kaal ke ho sakate he
 Some of the Upanishads, such as Chhandogya and Brihadaranyaka, may also be considered to be pre-buddha times, and similarly some narratives of Aitareya and Shatapatha Brahmana may also be considered to be pre-buddha
 inkaa bhi jaatakon se or saamanytah pali sahitya se ghanishtha sambandh he
 The Tavija Sutta mentions the names of these ten mantra sages as well as Aitareya Brahmana, Taittiriya Brahmana, Chandogya Brahmana and Chhanda Brahmana, along with the names of Atakka, Vamak, Vamdev, Vishvamitra, Yamadagni, Andighara, Bharadwaja, Vasistha, Kashyapa and Bhrigu

 Many signs of close contact with Vedic literature are also found among the natives
 uddalak jataka main uddalak ke takshashila jane or vahaan ek lok vishrut acharya kii soochna paane kaa ullekh he
 Similarly, in Setuketu Jataka there is mention of Uddālaka's son तुvetuketu to go to Taxila to study arts
 shatapath brahman ke uddalak ko ham uttarapath main bhraman karte hue dekhte he
 Therefore, it is not inconsistent to conclude from this that the Uddālakas of the Jātakas and ्वेvetuketu Brahmins are not different from the persons of these names in the texts and Upanishads
 german vidwaan luders ne sethuketu jataka main aane vaali gaathaon ko vaidic aakhyaan or mahakavy yugin kavy ko milaane vaali kadi kaha he, jo samuchit hi he
 Similarly, Sinhalese scholar Malalasekar says that the Jataka is related to the narrative genre of Indian literature from which the later epics have developed
 ramayana or mahabharat ke saath jataka kii tulana karte samay hamen yah dhyaan rakhana chahie ki in donon granthon ke sabhi ansh buddha purv yug ke nahin he
 There are 2400 verses in the present form of Ramayana
 ramayana main kaha bhi gaya he ‘chaturvinsh sahatrani shlokanam ukt van rishih
 But Buddhist scripture proves that even in the second century AD, there were only 12,000 verses in the Ramayana
 ramayana 2-109-34 main buddha tathagat kaa ullekh miltaa he
 Similarly, there is a description of conflict with Shaka, Yavan etc
 kiskindha kand main sugriv ke dwaara kuru madra or himalay ke bich main yawanon ou r shakon ke desh or nagaron ko sthit bataaya gaya he
 This proves that at the time when the passages were written, the Greeks and Scythians had established their suzerainty over some regions of Punjab
 atah ramayana ke kaaphi ansh maharaj bimbisar yaa buddha ke kaal ke baad likhe gayi
 There is a clear mention of educations in Maha Bharat

 jataka kii anek gaathaon or ramayana ke shlokon main adbhut samanta he
 In Dasaratha Jataka and Devadhamma Jataka we often get the complete outline of rama-katha
 jayddis jataka main ram kaa dandakarany janaa dikhaaya gaya he
 Similarly, the resemblance of Sama Jataka is from Ramayana 2
 63-25 and in the opinion of Vinternitz the description of Jataka is more simple and preliminary
 vessantar jataka ke prakruti varnan kaa samya isi prakaar valmiki ke prakruti varnan se he or is jataka kii katha ke saath ram kii katha main bhi kaaphi sadrushta he
 Many scholars have compared Jataka with Mahabharata
 unke nishkarshon ko yahan sankshiptatam rup main bhi rakhana vastav main bada kathin he
 The Janak is the Janak Upanishads of the Jataka and the Brahminical Janak of Mahabharata
 mithila ke prasaadon ko jalte dekhakar janak ne kaha tha mithilaayaan pradiptayan na main dahyati kinchan
 Exactly the same statement is found in Mahajanaka Jataka and also in Kumbhakara Jataka and Sonak Jataka
 atah donon vyakti ek he
 Similarly, the entire story of Rishyashrighain is in Nakinika Jataka
 yudhisthir or vidura kaa samvaad das brahman jataka main he
 There is a story of Krishna and Draupadi in Kunal Jataka
 isi prakaar ghat jataka main krishna dwaara kansa-vadh or dwarka basaane kaa puraa varnan he
 The Mahakana Jataka Nimi Jataka and Mahanaradkasap Jataka describe King Ushinar and his son Shivi
 civi jataka main bhi raja shivi kii daan parmita kaa varnan he, apni aankhon ko de dene ke rup main
 So the story is basically Buddhist, no doubt
 mahabharat main 100 brahmadatton kaa ullekh he
 Probably Brahmadatta was the common adjective of kings, not the name of a single king, which was adopted by 100 kings
 dummedh jataka main bhi raja or uske kumaar donon kaa naam brahmadatt bataaya gaya he
 Similarly in Gangmal Jataka it is said that Brahmadatta is the name of the clan
 suseem jataka, kummaspind jataka, atthan jataka, lomaskassap jataka aadi jaatakon kii bhi, yahi sthiti he
 Therefore, Brahmadatta who came among the natives is not synonymous with only one time
 unamem kuch na kuch aitihaasikta bhi avashya he
 In addition to Ramayana and Mahabharata, Jataka stories are also mentioned in the great language of Patanjali
 pracheen jan sahitya main or baad ke katha-sahitya par bhi uskaa prabhaav uplakshith he
 In the first century AD, Gunadhya wrote his vadkaha in Paisachi Prakrit which is not available today

 Likewise, many stories can be shown in Jupiter stories based on the Jataka stories
 bhartiya lok-sahitya main bhi anek jataka-kahaniyon ko adrishy rup se khoja ja saktaa he
 Such stories are prevalent in every province of India

 The story of Bandar and Baya as Sikh na Dijai Banra, Baya Kau Ghar Jai is known in all the states of India
 bandar or baya kii yah kahani kutidusak jataka kii kahani he
 Similarly, many stories can be explored in an entertaining way

 anya anek kahaniyon kii bhi tulana vidwaanon ne jataka se kii hai
 The Arabs invaded Europe in the eighth century
