 Kaal is at least one of the four qualities, with emotion, voice and aspect, which can make the expression clear
 kaal ek abhivyakti ke ghatnakram ke saath samayik sandarbhon kaa viparyaas vyatirek darshaate hai
 All languages use the same tense - present, past and future, although the expression of these tenses cannot always be explicitly translated from one language to another
 While all languages have typical forms of verbs by which they are identified and sorted into dictionaries, generally the most common present tense or a simple form, the methods used to express their tenses, differ between languages
 kuch aisi bhashaaen hai jinamein kaal kriya rup ke madhyam se antahkunchit nahin hota or na hi sanrachanaatmak drushti se abhivyakt hota he, balki iske bajaay, jab bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he tab, samayik kriya visheshan ke istemaal se antarnihit kiya jaataa he or kuch main samayik jaankaree antahkunchit visheshan ke istemaal dwaara prakat hoti he

 Past tense can range from simple past / past to immediate past / past, distant or distant past / past as well, there is only one difference between them and that is, the distance between events at current reference points

 In other words, pure tense refers to expressions in which attestation is believed to be true or known
 duusari ore, kriyabhaav dyotak kaal vartmaan, bhoot, yaa bhavishya kii un abhivyaktiyon ko sanderbhit karata he jinamein anupramann kii nischitata purnataya nishchit nahin he
 In English, this form is expressed by adding a verb adverb, adverb signifier adverb or adverb signifier adverb
 kriya ghataane se keval angrezi main bhoot kaal abhivyakt kiya jaataa he
 In all the raw and infallible aspects, the past tense is expressed by using the indirect form of the aspectual complement, tha / were, to be)

 This form is possible only in a few positive lectures
 kathan ke sabhi anya prakaaron main, pheravat rup niojit kiya janaa chahie

 jaisaa ki bhoot kaal ke saath he antahkunchit rup kuch sakaaratmak vyakhyanon ke liye upyog kiye ja sakate hai
 In English, the pure future tense is expressed in the same way as the present tense, but with a future-signifying adverb or time phrase
 angrezi main kriyabhaav dyotak kaal yaa to ek purnataya sweekrut kriyabhaav dyotak rup ke istemaal dwaara abhivyakt kiya jaataa he yaa ek atirikt kriyabhaav dyotak kriya visheshan yaa padbandh ke saath ek shuddh kaal rup dwaara

 The tenses are broadly classified as present, past, or future
 in vyapak vargikarnon ke bheetar kai sambhavit kaal maujuud hai
 The difference between these periods is mainly the degree of occasional distance from the time of narration
 udhaaharan ke liye, bhoot kaal kii saamaanya shrenee ke bheetar, tatkaal ateet, sudur ateet, dur sudur ateet or doorvarti ateet maujuud ho sakate hai, inamen antar keval kathan ke ghatnakram ke saath kathan ke samay se duuri main badhottaree kaa he

 If inorganic materials are present then some percentage of the entire plant and animal material included in the food should be organic and any inorganically generated material should be subject to various agricultural requirements
 Foods that claim to be organic must be free of artificial food additives and often processed with artificial methods, materials and conditions such as chemical cooking, food irradiation and genetically modified ingredients

 To be certified organic, the products must be developed and manufactured in such a way that they comply with the set standards of the country under which they are sold: kheti kii paaramparik or jaivik pranaaliyon kii tulana or jaanch karne ke liye kai surveykshan or adhyayan kiye gaye hai
 The general consensus in these surveys is that organic agriculture is less harmful due to the following reasons: haalanki, jaivik krishi ke tareekon ke kuch aalochakon kaa maananaa he ki ek hi maatra main khaadya ke utpaadan ke liye paramparaagat kheton kii tulana main jaivik kheton ke liye adhik bhoomi kii aavashyaktaa hoti he

 Similar to other reports, an investigation by the Department of Environmental Food and Rural Affairs in the UK in 2003 found that organic agriculture "can produce positive environmental benefits", but if compared on the basis of production unit rather than area Benefits are reduced or lost

 Such findings and the dependence of organic food on manure from low-yielding cattle have encouraged criticism by scientists that organic agriculture is environmentally unhealthy and unable to feed the entire world

 Therefore, after catching him, the police put him in jail

 The cell where Tralang Swamy was locked by the police was locked and the lock of that cell was intact and how the Tralang Swami came on the roof of the jail was a matter of surprise

 The Treaty of Versailles took place at the end of the First World War between Germany and the coalition countries
 pratham vishwayuddh ke baad parajeet germany ne 28 june 1919 ke din varsay kii sandhi par hastakshar kiye
 This led to Germany losing a large part of its land, banning the occupation of other states, limiting the size of their army and imposing heavy compensation
 varsay kii sandhi ko germany par jabardastee thopa gaya tha
 For this reason Adolf Hitler and other Germans considered it disgraceful and thus the treaty was one of the causes of World War II
 paris shanti sammelan main anekanek sandhiyon evam samjhauton kaa masavida taiyaar kiya gaya or un par hastakshar kiye gayi, lekin in sabhi sandhiyon main germany ke saath jo varsay kii sandhi hui vah anek drushtiyon se mahatvapurn he or sabhi sandhi main pramukh he
 After four months of hard work, the contract of the treaty was ready
 230 prishthon main ankit yah sandhi 15 bhaagon main vibhakt thi or usamen 440 dharaayen thim
 On 6 May 1919, it appeared before the conference and was approved
 30 april ko hi videsh-mantri count phon brokaduf rantaju ke netritv main german pratinidhi-mandal varsay pahunchaa
 The delegates were held at the Tryon Palace Hotel

 The hotel was surrounded by barbed wire and German representatives were forbidden to contact any representative of the Allies or any journalist
 7 may ko climeshon ne anya pratinidhi-mandalon ke samaksh, trayanan hotel main, german pratinidhi mandal ke sammukh sandhi kaa masavida prastut kiya
 He was given only two weeks to discuss this issue
 germany ko kisi bhi tarah sandhi par hastakshar karnaa hi tha
 German politicians seriously considered the treaty issue and after 26 days submitted an opposing proposal of sixty thousand words on their behalf
 germany ne is baat kii shikaayat kii thi ki usne jin sharton par aatmasamarpan kiya tha, prastaavit sandhi main un siddhanton kaa ulanghan hua he
 He said that the new government of Germany is completely democratic and is interested in membership of the League of Nations
 nirastrikaran kii shart keval germany par hi nahin, apitu samast rajyon par lagu kii jaani chahie
 It is wrong to hold sole Germany responsible for the World War
 german prastaav main yah bhi kaha gaya tha ki sandhi kii sabhi sharton ko maananaa asambhav he
 Permanent peace cannot be established by crushing and enslaving a large nation
 mitrarashtron ne germany ke prastaavon par vichaar kiya or kuch chote-mote parivartan ke baad germany ko paanch dinon ke bheetar hi sanshodhit sandhi par hastakshar karne ko kaha gaya
 This time Germany was not given the opportunity to submit any amendment or request regarding the terms of the treaty
 mitrarashtron ne spasht kar diya tha ki hastakshar nahin karne kaa arth germany par punah akraman hoga
 Finally, the German government accepted the signing of the treaty
 rashtrasang kaa nirmaan evam sanghathan varsay-sandhi kaa ek atyant mahatvapurn ang tha
 The first part of the treaty is related to this
 yah multah raashtrapati wilson kaa srijan tha
 He thought that the League of Nations should be the greatest work of peace conference
 lid jorge ne likhaa he wilson shanti-sandhiyon ke keval us bhaag ko jisamen rashtrasang kii vyavastha thi, sabase adhik mahatv detaa tha
 For this, he was ready to make any sacrifice and in the end it was due to his hard efforts that the League of Nations was created
 wilson ko chhodkar mitrarashtra ke anya pratinidhiyon kaa yah vichaar tha ki rashtrasang sambandhi baton ko varsay-sandhi ke antargat rakhana aavashyak nahin he
 Eventually Wilson agreed and the Constitution of the League of Nations was placed under the Treaty of Versailles

 German Colonial System: The Allies wanted the German colonies to meet in their respective empires, but Wilson strongly opposed it

 It was meant that the welfare and development of the countries which are very backward

 It was because of Wilson's influence that the League of Nations was placed in the Treaty of Warsaw
 rashtrasang kaa uddeshy anterrashtriya sahyog evam suraksha ko kaayam karnaa tha
 In many treaties in world history, the Treaty of Versailles has been the most described and disputed
 vastutah is sandhi ne vishwa itihaas kii dhara ko gahare rup se prabhavit kiya
 These treaties are sharply criticized and understood as the seeds of this Second World War
 nimna binduon ke tahat is sandhi kii aalochana ko dekha ja saktaa he- 1
 Accused Treaty: The Treaty of Warsaw is known as the "accusatory peace", that is, the "accusatory treaty"
 sandhi ko taiyaar karte samay sammelan main germany ko sthaan nahin diya gaya
 This was the order of the Allies which Germany had no other remedy except to accept
 german pratinidhiyon ke dwaara sikaayat karne par bhi unhen dhamkee di gayi kii yadi ve paanch din ke andar sandhi par hastakshar nahin kiye to unke khilaaf punah akraman kar diya jaayegaa
 Therefore, it sat on the mind of Germany that it is an alleged treaty which they are not obliged to obey
 yahi vajah he ki germany ne aage chalakar sandhi praavdhaanon ko thukraa diya
 2
 No peace of public, peace of diplomats: The provisions mentioned in the Treaty of Versailles could not fulfill the interests and aspirations of the general public
 isamen kai aisi pradeshik vyavasthaayen thi jisamen sanshodhan kii jarurat thi
 Several provisions were made in compensation that could not be recovered without causing devastating blow to the industrial revival of Europe
 is tarah jansadharan kii shanti kaa yah sandhi puraa nahin karti
 3
 Strict and Disgraceful Conditions: Germany was shattered by the Treaty of Warsaw, the colonies were stripped financially, the ownership of other nations over economic resources, and the military was crippled
 
 kshatipurti kii shart atyant kathor evam apmanjanak thi
 In the event of non-payment of compensation amount, there was talk of occupying the territories of Germany
 vastutah vijeta raashtra ne pratishodh ke tahat kathor sharton ko germany par ladaa
 The terms of the treaty were so harsh that no self-respecting, cultured nation could bear it
 churchill ke shabdon main “isaki aarthik sharten is had tak kalankapurna tathaa nirbuddha thi ki unhone ne ise spashtatya nirarthak bana diya
 " 4
 sandhi galat sthanon par kathor tathaa galat tareeke se naram thi : yah sandhi keval asaamaanya rup se kathor nahin thi, varan galat sthanon par kathor tathaa galat tareeke se naram thi
 The attempt by Germany to approve so-called war crime provisions was beyond reality because, as David Thomson put it, "mentioning this in a draft that the German delegates were forced to sign cannot create a sense of sense of responsibility
" Were
 ” duusare kshatipurti kii maang bhi asambhav maatra main kii gai thi or isaki vrihat raashi bina kisi gambhir vichaar kiye nishchit kii gai thi
 How it would be possible for the Germans to repay this wealth economically and for the Allies was not analyzed
 nihsandeh dand or muaavje kaa sampurna aakaar aviveki or avyavhaarik tha
 All the above mentioned unnecessary rigors did not take any distinct action against Germany's ability to express national dissatisfaction and anger
 yah sandhi galat tareeke se naram thi, 'saar kshetra' kaa raashtra sangh dwaara 15 varsh tak shashan or 1935 main use germany kaa lautaa dena shaayad hi uchit tha
 The authority of the Allies on Rhineland for 15 years also proved hollow
 5
 pratishodhatmak sandhi : vijeta rashtron ne pratishodhatmak ravaiya apanaakar kathor sharton ko germany par ladaa
 France was seeking to avenge its old defeat and non-compliance, so that the treaty made the most stringent provisions with Germany
 6
 apmanjanak sandhi : yah sandhi germany ke liye rashtriya apmaan kaa kaaran thi
 The overthrow of Kaiser William, recovery of heavy damage supply

 Clemenceau's indecent behavior with German delegates coming for the signing of treaty letters, keeping them as prisoners, abusing the public, throwing rotten fruit, bricks, stones at them, was not an insult to the delegates but to Germany
 7
 vishwasghaatee sandhi : varsay kii sandhi naitik drushti se anuchit va germany ke saath vishwasghaat maani gai
 Germany had accepted a war tax treaty based on Wilson's 14 sources, but these treaties of Wilson were openly violated in the Treaty of Warsaw
 germany ke saath rashtriyata ke siddhant kaa paalan nahin hua tha
 Many conditions were imposed on him
 lekin vijetaon ko usase mukt rakhaa gaya he
 According to Wilson's third source, the attempt was to remove all barriers to international trade, but Germany's collective freedom was not protected
 uskaa antarrashtriya vyapaar varshon tak mitrarashtron ke niyantran main rahaa
 The 14 sources suggested the reduction of arms of all nations, but the Allies severely limited Germany's military power without reducing their arms
 mitra rashtron ne wilson ke 14 sutron kaa paalan usee seemaa tak kiya jahaan tak unhen laabh tha
 Thus Germany was betrayed in the Treaty of Warsaw
 is vishwasghaat kaa badla lene ke liye aage germany ne yuddh kiya
 8
 Ideological Conflicts among the Prophets of the Treaty: The Treaty of Warsay provided a status of conflict among the three elders' opinions and objectives
 wilson ke ucch parantu avyaavhaarik vichaar, climenso ke rashtravaadi va yathartwaadee maangon tathaa lid george ke avasarwaadi uddeshyon ke bich virodh tha, baavjood iske varsay kii sandhi par inaki sahmati thi jo inke samrajyavaadee va shoshan kii maansikta ko pratibibint karata he
 According to Logson "there was intense opposition to Wilson's idealism and materialism of convention, and in most cases materialism emerged victorious
" ” 9
 Beginning of new phase of Conflict: The Treaty of Warsaw marked the beginning of a new struggle for universal power among European nations
 1919 tak anterrashtriya vidhi kisi desh kii sarkaar tathaa uske nagarikon kii sampatti main bhed maanati thi
 But according to the Treaty of Warsaw, the warring country could seize some kind of property of a person of an enemy country within the border of himself and his allies
 yadi vah yuddh main vijayi hua to parajeet desh kii sarkaar ko apane nagarikon kii idas prakaar jabt kii gai sampatti kii kshatipurti karne ke liye baadhya kar saktaa tha
 This was a new parable
 10
 wimer ganatantr ke prati ghrinaa : yuddh ke baad germany main wimer ganatantr kii sthapana hui or use varsay kii sandhi se jodakar dekha gaya
 Among all the liberal features, it was considered as an institution established by the enemy party
 isliye germany main prajatantr aarambh se hi dwandv, ghrinapatr va shatrupaksh kii vyavastha ban gaya
 11
 Disregard of the principle of self-determination: The boundaries of Italy were not set on the principle of nationalism, nor were all citizens on Poland's land unquestionably polled

 The doctrine of self-judgment concerning Germany was disregarded
 raashtrapati wilson ke aatmanirnay ke siddhant ke anusaar europe ke anek rashtron kaa punargathan kiya gaya tha
 Accordingly, it was decided to create a separate system of people of the same nation, caste, language and cultural tradition
 isi aadhaar par checkoslovakia, poland, yugoslavia ke swatantra rajyon kaa janm hua
 But this principle was not followed in relation to Germany, Austria and Hungary
 germany ke hajaaron nagarikon ko german samrajya se pruthak karke anya rajyon ke adheen kar diya gaya
 "in 1918 AD, when the Austrian Germans established the german-austrian Republic and expressed the desire of the Germans to join the Republic and annex the land, the Allied States banned the annexation of the two states in September 1919 AD
 Gone
 is prakaar mitra rashtron dwaara swayan dwaara sweekrut siddhant ko germany ke vishay main kriyanvit na kar german nagarikon ko niraash kiya gaya
 According to Butlerne, "not using the principle of self-determination in a reasonable sense was an indication of the inherent weakness in the Parisian system
" ” The treaty of Versailles has a special place in the most discussed treaties of world history and its effects
 us sandhi ke kathor praavdhaanon or uske swaroop ke sandarbh main aalochakon ne ise dwitiya vishwayuddh ke kaaran ke rup main paribhaashit kiya he
 According to him, the Treaty of Warsay was the father of discontent rather than a system of peace
 sandhi ke thik 20 varsh 2 maheene 4 din pashchaat yah sansar dwitiya vishwayuddh ke chapet main aa gaya
 Since the treaty, its arrangements were disbanded by Germany
 saath hi sandhi praavdhaanon main sanshodhan bhi kiye jate rahe
 Violations and amendments of these treaty provisions pushed the world towards World War II
 sandhi praavdhaanon kaa ulanghan evam sanshodhan isliye kiya gaya ki yah atyadhik kathor evam apmanjanak thi
 No self-respecting nation could tolerate the terms of such a harsh and degrading treaty for a long time
 atah yah spasht tha ki germany bhavishya main uparyukt avasar milte hi varsay sandhi dwaara thopi gai vyavastha se mukt hone tathaa apmaan ke kalank dhone kaa prayaas karegaa
 Ezberger of the Catholic Center Party of Germany said at the time of the cease-fire treaty that "the German race will suffer but will not die
 " swabhaavik rup se germany ne is apmanjanak sharton ko dhone kaa safal prayaas kiya
 As a result, within a few years the political atmosphere of Europe became very turbulent and the world had to witness a fierce and catastrophic war even more than the First World War
 france ke marshall foch ke anusaar bhi "yah sandhi shanti nahin he, keval 20 varshon kaa yudhviram he
 "it is clear that the seeds of World War II existed in this treaty
 1919 main sandhi ke samay germany asahaay tha or sandhi ke chupchaap sweekaar karne ke alaava uske paas koi chaara na tha lekin jaise-jaise samay bitta gaya vaise-vaise vah kuch shakti sanchay karke sandhi kii sharton kaa ulanghan karne laga or sandhi nirmaataaon ne bhi usamen sanshodhan kiye
 The first part of the treaty was amended in 1926 when Germany was granted membership of the League of Nations
 yuddh aparaadhiyon sambandhi saatvaan bhaag kabhi purnatah kriyanvit nahin kiya gaya
 Many of the war criminals, including the German Emperor William Kaiser, were punished and only a few were given general punishment
 kshatipurti se sambandhit praavdhaan ko pehle to sanshodhit kiya gaya or baad main purnatah tyaag diya gaya
 The question of indemnification at the Lojan Conference was abolished
 1933-34 main german raajnneeti main hitler ke utkarsh ke baad varsay kii sharton ko todna to ek maamuli baat ho gai
 In 1935–36, Hitler violated the provisions relating to disarmament of the treaty and increased armies and in 1936 took control of Rheinland
 march 1938 main austria ko germany ke saath milakar tathaa sitambar 1938 checkoslovakia ko milakar hitler ne varsay kii sandhi ke pradeshik vyavasthaaon ke praavdhaanon ko bhang kar diya
 World War II started when Hitler invaded Poland with the aim of breaking the Polish Corridor and Danzing Port-related arrangements made by Poland under the Treaty of Versailles
 kuch milakar varsay sandhi kii anyaaypurna vyavasthaaon ko todane ke liye hi hitler ne ghatnaon kii vah shrunkhlaa aarambh kii jiske kaaran dwitiya vishwayuddh kaa visphot hua
 In this way, the final culmination of the process of elimination of the Treaty provisions of Versailles occurred at the beginning of the Second World War
 is drushti se dwitiya vishwayuddh ke beej varsay kii sandhi main dekhe ja sakate hai
 Some critics believe that the World War II was not the harsh condition of the Versailles treaty, but the laxity in implementing them
 logsam ke anusaar- Thus there is no doubt that the unjustly harsh and degrading treaty of Versailles was to a extent liable to World War II
 kintu yah bhi satya he ki mitra rashtron kii paraspar virdohi niti, upeksha, udaseenta, tushtikaran or sandhi kii sharton ko kathortapurvak lagu na karwaane kii niti bhi iske liye kam uttaradaayi nahin thi

 Nevertheless, the term relativity or relativity is sometimes used to refer to Galilean invariance
 theory off relativity naamak is shabd kaa prayog sabase pehle san 1906 main maiks plank ne kiya tha
 It was derived from the English term group "relative Theory" which describes how this theory uses the Principles of Relativity
 isi paper ke charchaa sambhag main alfred bukarar ne pratham baar "theory of relativity" kaa prayog kiya tha
 The relativity principle is in essence that the existence of 'absolute' speed and 'absolute' acceleration is impossible, that is, the terms 'absolute speed' and 'absolute acceleration' are virtually meaningless
 yadi 'nirpeksh gati' kaa arth hota to vah anya pindo kii charchaa kiye bina hi nishchit ho sakati
 But even after trying all the ways, the 'absolute' motion of a body has not been definitively proved by experiment and now the theory of relativity suggests that it is impossible to determine it
 aapekshikta siddhant se bhautikee main ek nae drushtikon kaa prarambh hua
 With the advent of relativity theory, some old theories of physics were firmly fixed and there was a need to think more closely about many fundamental imaginations
 vigyaan main siddhant kaa kaary praaia: gyaat falon ko vyavasthit rup se sutrit karnaa hota he or uske baad us siddhant se nae falon kaa anumaan karke prayog dwaara un falon kii pariksha kii jaati he
 Relativity theory has been successful in both these works
 19veen shatabdi ke ant tak bhautikee kaa vikaas newton pranit siddhanton ke anusaar ho rahaa tha
 Every new invention or experimental fruit was seen from the point of view of these principles and necessary new hypotheses were made
 inamen sarvyaapee ether kaa ek vishisht sthaan tha
 There were two major reasons for imagining the existence of ether
 pratham to vidyutchumbakeey tarangon ke kampan kaa ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak prasaran hone ke liye ether jaise madhyam kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Second, Newton's kinetic equations in mechanics, and also the background on which these equations were based, required an authentic director
 prayogon ke falon kaa yatharth akalan hone ke liye ether par vishisht gundharmon kaa aropan kiya jaataa tha
 Ether was considered ubiquitous and believed to exist in all directions and bodies
 is sthir ether main pind bina pratirodh ke bhraman kar sakate hai, aisi kalpana thi
 Due to these properties, there was no obstacle in understanding ether as an absolute standard
 prakaash kii gati 3x108 me
 prati second he, yah gyaat hua tha or prakaash kii tarangen 'sthir' ether ke saapeksh is gati se vikirit hoti hai, aisi kalpana thi
 In mechanics, ether was also considered an absolute standard for velocity, acceleration, force, etc
 19veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main ether kaa astitv tathaa uske gundharm sthapit karne ke anek praytn prayog dwaara kiye gaye
 Among them, the use of Michelson Morley is particularly important and notable
 prithvi, surya kii parikrama ether ke saapeksh jis gati se karti he us gati kaa yatharth maapan karnaa is prayog kaa uddeshy tha
 But this attempt was unsuccessful and from the result of the experiment it was estimated that the speed of the earth with respect to ether is zero
 iskaa yah bhi arth hua ki ether kii kalpana asaty he, arthath ether kaa astitv hi nahin he
 If there is no ether then even absolute standards cannot exist
 at: gati keval saapeksh hi ho sakati he
 In physics, work is usually done by directing any one method to measure the speed or to express the result
 kintu in nirdeshak paddatiyon main koi bhi paddati 'vishistaaapurna' nahin ho sakati, kyonki yadi aisa hota to us 'vishistaaapurna' nirdeshak paddati ko ham vishranti kaa maanak samaj sakate
 a similar result was obtained from many experiments
 in prayogon ke falon se keval bhautikee main hi nahin, balki vigyaan tathaa darshan main bhi gambhir ashaanti utpann hui
 In the early 20th century, the famous French mathematician H
 Poincaré presented the rule of relativity
 inke anusaar bhautikee ke niyam aise swaroop main vyakt hone chahie ki ve kisi bhi prekshak ke liye vaastavik hon
 This means that the laws of physics should not be observable above the speed of the observer
 is pranium se dik tathaa kaal kii prachlit dharanaon par nayaa prakaash padaa
 Einstein's ideology on this subject, though revolutionary, was more successful in explaining the fruits of experiments
 oinstin ne gati, twaran, dik, kaal ityadi moulik shabdon kaa or unase sanyukt prachlit dharanaon kaa vishesh vishleshan kiya
 From this analysis, it became clear that there are errors in physics based and distinguished by Newton's theories
 oinstin pranit aapekshikta siddhant ke do vibhaag hai : In specific relativity theory the laws of physics are expressed in the form that they will be the same for any observant observer
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is prakaar vyakt hote hai ki ve prekshak kii gati se swatantra yaa abaadhit honge
 The specific relativity theory developed in 1905 and the general relational theory developed in 1915
 iskaa pratipaadan san 1905 main oinstin ne apane ek shodhpatr on da electrodinemics off mowing bodies main kii thi
 Specific relativity is based on two hypotheses that contradict the concepts of classical mechanics: vishisht aapekshikta ke siddhanth se nikalne vaale parinaam ascharyajanak hai; inamen se kuch is prakaar hai: In classical mechanics Galileo's transformation is used while Lorents transformation in specific relativity
 san 1907 se 1911 ke bich ainstin dwaara viksit aapekshikta siddhanth hi 'saamaanya aapekshikta' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 This theory is based on the following two hypotheses: lambaai, dik, kaal, dravyaman, urja ityadi ke vishay main bhotiki main jo dharanaayen thim unamem vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ne sudhaar kiya
 Apart from these, there are other subjects in the field of physics which are equally important, but their inclusion is not in the specific relativity theory
 bal tathaa vidyutchumbakeey kshetron main vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa jaisaa upyog ho saktaa he vaisaa gurutveey kshetra main nahin ho saktaa
 Gravity is an extremely important department of physics, so it is clear that there is a need to broaden the specific relativity theory
 dravyaman kaa sambandh bhautikee main do prakaar se aata he
 When a force acts on a body, the body's position changes and its velocity changes
 jab tak bal kaary karata he tab tak pind ko twaran miltaa he
 According to the laws of mechanics the force, mass and acceleration of the body have the following relation: is sameekaran main jo dravyaman m he usko jadtv yaa ashrith dravyaman kehete hai
 The second relation of mass comes under the gravitational field of Newton
 newton dwaara diye gayi gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke anusaar yadi do dravyaman, m1 tathaa m2, duuri r par hon, to unke bich main nimnlikhit gurutvkarshneey bal f kaam karegaa : g is the gravitational constant in this equation
 yadi ham m1 ko prithvi kaa dravyaman samajhen or m2 ko dharti ke paas sthit kisi anya pind kaa dravyaman samajhen to sameekaran dravyaman m2 kaa bhaar vyakt karegaa
 In Newton's mechanics, kinetics and gravity are independent and different, but both have a relationship of mass
 dravyaman ke in do swatantra tathaa bhinn vibhaagon main prayukt kalpanaaon kaa ekikaran oinstin ne apane saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main kiya
 It was known that inertial mass and gravitational mass are the same
 oinstin ne dravyaman kii is samanta kaa upyog karke gativigyaan or gurutvkarshan ko ekarup kiya or san 1915 i
 main vyapak aapekshikta siddhant prastut kiya
 The method of formulating general relativity theory in mathematics is different from other methods
 isamen vishesh jyamiti kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jo euclid kii tri-aiami jyamiti se bhinn he
 ] Stated that in the specific relativity theory, if the three dimensions of difficulty and the fourth dimension of time, a 'chatrayayam Satti' with these four dimensions, is imagined, then the theory of relativity becomes much simpler
 samakshanikta, nirpeksh nahin he - yah pramanit kiya ja chukaa he
 This eliminates the Newton-posed problem and the absolute and freedom of time
 at: bhautik ghatana vyakt karne ke liye dik tathaa samay kii chaturaayam satati adhik swaabhaavik he
 Einstein made more use of what Reiman had developed for his geometry by imagining 'chatrayayam Dikha'
 dik tathaa samay kii is chaturaayam satati main bhautikee ke siddhant jyamitiya rup se saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main rakhe gaye
 This Chatrayayam Satti is equated with the problem of Euclid's three dimensions
 teen aayam kii satati main, in teen nirdeshaankon se jis prakaar bindu athwa ek sthaan nishchit hota he, vaise hi do bindu or ke bich kii lambaai bhi nishchit hoti he
 When time is added along these three dimensions of the problem in Chatrayayam Sati, then the dimension of time comes as t = x0
5c-1, where t = time and c = velocity of light
 ek prekshak ke liye ek vishwaghatana ke nirdenshank hon to us prekshak ke saapeksh gatiman duusare prekshak ke liye usee ghatana ke nirdeshank honge
 If the laws of Lorenz's conversion are true, it can be proved that sameekaran kaa vikaas karke kisi bhi prakaar kii gati ke liye isi prakaar kii kintu atyadhik sanmishra padasanhtiyaan milti hai
 For this, the principles of principles and principles are required
 moulik kalpanaaon kaa is reeti se vistaar karne par vyapak aapekshikta siddhant main gurutvkarshan swabhaavat: aata he
 It does not require specific hypotheses
 anek ghatnaon ke fal, oinstin pranit vyapak aapekshikta siddhant ke anusaar tathaa newton pranit pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar, samaan hi hote hai
 But when the general relativity principle was used in astronomy, the results of the three phenomena differed somewhat from those produced according to the iconic mechanics
 in falon se saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kii kasuti kaa kaam le sakate hai
 These three fruits are as follows: unani itihaas ke anusaar "hectares" ek trogen senapati or rajkumaar tha
