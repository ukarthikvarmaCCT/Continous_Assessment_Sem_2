 If they went ahead, o'brien partnered with the move to create host and time slot conflicts with Leno, Zakar and NBC as a whole, given the overwhelming public and professional support and negative backlash against them for their involvement
 Refused to be made

 This word is much larger than the word Flora which is especially related to the caste structure

 Ancient redwood forests, coastal evergreen forests, moss-growing mosses, desert soil layers, roadside grasses, wheat fields, orchards, orchards — all these are included in the definition of trees
 ped-paudhe biosphere ke mahatvapurn kaaryon main har sambhav sthanik paimaanon par sahaayak hote hai
 First, trees and plants control the flow of many biogeochemicals, especially the cycles of water, carbon, and nitrogen — they also have enormous importance in local and world energy balance
 aise chakra na keval vanaspati ke vaishvik, balki jalwaayu ke bhi swaroopon ke liye mahatvapurn hote hai
 Secondly, trees also strongly affect soil properties, including soil volume, chemicality, and texture, which in turn affect various vegetation properties, including productivity and composition
 tisare, ped-paudhe is grah par maujuud jantuon kii vishaal sarani ke liye vanyajiwan awaas or urja ke strot kaa kaam karte hai
 Perhaps the most important, but often overlooked, factor is that the global flora is a major source of oxygen in the environment, which facilitates the emergence and maintenance of oxygen-dependent metabolic systems
 ]] Most of the work on classification of vegetation has been done by European and North American ecologists and their methods are also radically different
 uttar america main vanaspati ke prakaar nimna maapdandon ke sanyukt rup par aadhaarit hai – jalwaayu ke pratimaan, paudhon ke awaas, phenology or / yaa vikaas ke prakaar or pradhan jati

 In Europe, taxonomy often relies mostly and sometimes entirely on floristic structure, without explicitly speaking about climate, phenology, or patterns of development
 yah akasar sankethik yaa naidanik jati par jor detaa he jo ek prakaar ko duusare se alag karti he
 In the FGDC standard, the hierarchy levels, from the simplest to the most specific, are - mechanisms, classes, subclasses, groups, designs, matches, and relationships
 The lowest level, or relation, is most correctly defined and incorporates the names of one to three major castes of one type
 udhaaharan ke liye, varg ke str par kisi vanaspati prakaar kii paribhaasha, "van, canopi cover> 60% " ho saktaa he, banaavat ke str par, "jaade kii varsha, chaude pattey vaala, sadabahaar, sclerophillas, closed canopi van"; mail ke str par, "arboots menijee van"; or sambandh ke str par, "'arboots menjisi -lithocarpus denciflora van ", kaha jaataa he, jo california or origan, uese main paae jane vaale pacific madrone-tanok van hai
 In practice, levels of match and / or kinship are most commonly used, particularly in vegetative mapping, just as Latin binomials are most commonly used when discussing topics of race in taxonomy and general conversation
 austrailia main victoria main vanaspati ko paristhitivaigyanik vanaspati varg ke anusaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 Like all biological systems, vegetative society is topical and spatially moving
 ye har sambhav paimaanon par badalte rahete hai
 Mobility in vegetation is mainly defined as caste composition and / or vegetation composition
 samayik rup se, anek prakaar kii prakriyaayein yaa ghatnaayen parivartan laa sakati hai kintu saralata ke liye unhen achaanak yaa dhimi shreniyon main baanta ja saktaa he
 Sudden changes are commonly called disturbances - these include events like wildfires, strong winds, landslides, floods, avalanches
 inke kaaran saadharantah samudaay ke baahar hote hai—ye prakritik prakriyaayein hoti hai jo samudaay kii prakritik prakriyaaon se swatantra hoti hai
 Such events can bring changes in vegetation composition and caste structure for a very fast and long time period and can affect vast area
 aise bahut kam paritantr hai jinamein niyamit rup se or baar-baar kisi tarah ke updrav nahin hote or ye har dirghakaalik gatisheel tantra kaa hissaa hote hai
 Fire and wind infestations are particularly common in many plant types around the world

 dhimi gati se samayik parivartan sarvyaapee hota he –isamen paritantreey aavartan kaa kshetra nihit hota he
 a combination of rotational composition and classification is a relatively slow change that arises over time due to modifications brought by vegetation itself to various variable components of the environment such as light, water, and nutrition levels
 ye sanshodhan kisi bhi kshetra main badhane, bachane or prajnan main sarvaadhik yogya jati ko badal dete hai, jisase flora main parivartan hote hai
 These fluoristic changes cause cognitive changes that occur naturally even in the absence of caste changes in plant growth, causing slow and predictable changes in vegetation
 aavartan main kisi bhi samay updrav dwaara rukawat ho sakati he jisase tantra waapas apni purv dasha main laut jaataa he yaa or kisi maarg par chal padataa he
 This can cause recurring processes to reach or not reach a stable, final state
 iske alaava, aisi dashaon ke gunon kii bhavishyavaanee, bhale vah na ghate, hameshaa sambhav nahin he
 In short, vegetation communities depend on many variables that together determine the limits of possibilities for future conditions
 vanaspati vaigyanik sthanon or samay ke vibhinn paimaanon par vanaspati main dekhe jane vaale prakaaron or prakriyaaon ke kaarnon kaa adhyayan karte hai
 Questions regarding the relative roles of climate, soil, topography and history on the characteristics of vegetation, including composition and composition of castes, are of particular interest and importance
 aise prashn akasar bade paimaane par hote hai or isaliye kisi jod-tod ke prayog dwaara aasaani se arthpurna tareeke se hal nahin kiye ja sakate
 isiliye vnaspatishaastra, peleovanaspatishaastra, paristhitishastra, mrudavigyaan aadi kii jaankaree ke sahyog se avlokaneey adhyayan vanaspati vigyaan main bahut aam hai
 Botany originated in the 18th century, or in some cases earlier, the work of botanists and / or naturalists
 inamen se anek khoj ke yug main khoj kii yatra par nikle vishwa yatri the or unka kaary vanaspatishaastra or bhugol kaa sanshleshit sanyog tha jise aajkal ham vanaspatik biogiography kehete hai
 At that time, there was little information about floristic or vegetation types around the world and little was known about whom they depended, so much of the work was limited to collecting, classifying and naming plant specimens
 19veen shatabdi tak bahut kam saidhantik kaary hua
 Alexander von Humboldt, who was among the earliest working naturalists, collected 60,000 botanical specimens during his five-year trip to South and Central America from 1799 to 1804
 Humboldt was one of the first scientists to document the relationship between climate and vegetation patterns in his monumental life-long work, "vise to the Equinational Regions of the New World" - which he wrote in collaboration with fellow botanist Amy Bopland 
 Humboldt described the vegetation in a physiognomic manner in addition to Texanami
 unke kaary ne paryaavaran-vanaspati ke sambandhon par gahan kaary kii shuruuaat kii jo aaj tak chaalu he

 Together they were far ahead of their time and they introduced or described almost all the important topics of today, long before the West
 in vishyon main vanaspati samudaay vishleshan, yaa phitososhiolaji, gradiant vishleshan, aavartan or vanaspati ekophizialaji or functional ikalaji par lekh shaamil the
 Most of the world, especially the English-speaking world, did not know much of their work until the 20th century through language and / or political factors
 united stats main henry cols or fredrick klements ne 20veen sadi ke shuru main vanaspati aavartan ke vichaaron kaa vikaas kiya
 Clement is now famous for describing the botanical community as an invalid superorganism
 usne tark pesh kiya kijaise kisi vyakti main sabhi avyav tantra milakar kaam karke sharir ke acchhee tarah se kaam karne main madad karte hai or jo vyakti ke vayask hone ke saath milakar viksit hote hai, usee tarah vanaspati samudaay main bhi har jati atyant kade samanvay or talmail ke saath viksit hoti he or paraspar sahyog karti he or vanaspati samudaay ko ek paribhaashit or purvaniyat ant sthiti kii ore dhakelti he
 Although Clements did much work on North American flora, his devotion to superorganism has shaken his reputation, as his work has not been supported by many researchers
 klements ke pratikul, anek paristhiti vaigyanikon ne darshaya he ki vaiyaktik pariklpana, jo kahati he ki vanaspati samudaay paryaavaran ke prati pratikriya kar rahi jatiyon ke ek samooh kaa kul jamaa he, sahi he or samay or sthaan main ek saath ghatati he
 Remensky presented the idea in Russia, and in 1926 Henry Gliasson developed it in a paper in the United States
 klementsian ke vichaaron kaa itnaa adhik prabhaav tha ki gliyasana ke vichaaron ko kai saalon tak asweekaar kiya gaya
 But in the 1950s and 60s, Robert Whitaker's series of well-crafted studies offered compelling evidence for Gliasson's arguments
 One of the most qualified American botanical scientists, Whitaker was a developer and proponent of gradient analysis in which pluralities of individual species are measured in front of measurable environmental transformers
 teen atyant bhinn monten paritantron ke adhyayanon main, whitaker ne dikhaaya ki jatiyaan mukhyatah paryaavaran ke sammukh pratikriya karti hai or anya saath main maujuud jatiyon se uskaa koi samanvay nahin hota
 anya kaary visheshkar peliobaatani par kiya gaya kaary bade samayik or sthanik paimaanon par is vichaar ko samarthan detaa he
 Since the 1960s, much of the research on flora has focused on topics of functional ecology
 kaaryaatmak dhaanche main, vargikaraniya vanaspatishaastra kaa kam mahatv hota he or sari khojbin jatiyon ke akritik, sharir-rachana or sharirkriyaatmak vargeekaran par kendrit rahati he or iskaa uddeshy yah bhavishyavaanee karnaa hota he ki vishisht samooh vibhinn paryaavarniya parivartakon ke prati kaise bartaav karenge
 is tarah ke drushtikon kaa aadhaar yah dharna he ki kendrabhimukh vikaas or anukulit vikiran ke kaaran visheshkar filogenetic vargeekaran ke ucch staron or bade sthanik paimaanon par akasar filogenetic apeksha or paryaavarniya anukulan ke bich majboot sambandh nahin hota he
 Functional classification began in the 1930s with the division into plant groups based on the location of Ranchier's epicycle meristems

 The conversation between Krishna and Arjuna is presented in the form of a book called Bhagavad Gita
 kuru kshetra kii yubhumi main shrikrishna ne arjuna ko jo upadesh diya tha vah shrimadbhagavadagita ke naam se prasiddh he
 Of all Hindu texts, the Srimad Bhagavad Gita is considered the most important
 kyonki isamen ek vyakti ke jivan kaa saar he or isamen mahabharat kaal se dwapar tak krishna ke sabhi lilao kaa varnan hai
 It is believed that it is composed by Maharishi Ved Vyasa, although there is no evidence but Bhagavad-gītā is a book based on a conversation between Arjuna and his charioteer Shri Krishna
 gita main karmyog, karm yoga, bhakthi yoga, rajyog, ek ishwarawaad aadi par bahut hi sundar tareeke se charchaa kii gai he

 ye sab mul kahani ko hi darshaate he hai lekin unki visheshtaon, vivaran or shaileyon main kaaphi bhinnata hai
 The most original work, Harivansh, is told in a realistic style that describes Krishna's life as a poor cowboy, but infused with poetic and supernatural imagination
 yah krishna kii mrityu ke saath samaapt nahin hoti
 According to some accounts, the fifth book of Vishnu Purana breaks away from the realism of Harivamsa and covers Krishna in mystical words and stanzas
many versions of the manuscripts of Vishnu Purana exist
 bhagwat puraana kii dasvin or gyarahavin pustakon ko vyapak rup se ek kavishtha kriti mana jaataa he, jo ki kalpana or rupakon se bharaa hua he, harivansh main paye jane vaale jeevon ke yatharthwaad se koi sambandh nahin he
 Krishna's life is presented as a cosmic drama, where his father Dharmaguru Nanda was introduced as a king

 On 17 March 1883, near the tomb of Karl Marx, his friend and colleague Angel said, "just as Darwin researched the law of evolution in the living world, Marx researched the law of evolution in human history
" unhone is saamaanya tathy ko khoj nikaala ki iske pehle ki vah raajnneeti, vigyaan, kala, dharm or is prakaar kii baton main ruchi le sake, maanav ko sabase pehle khaanaa pinaa, vastra or awaas milanaa chahie
 This means that along with the necessary physical means imminent for the sustenance of life, the phase of the then economic development of a nation or era, forms the basis on which state institutions are built up to the legislative approach and artistic and religious ideas of the concerned persons

 It is a belief that has fundamental importance and which is essentially simple
 itihaas main parivartanon ke liye aadi prerak shakti yugavishesh kii aarthik utpaadan kii vyavastha or tajjanit sambandhon main nihit hoti he
 This notion contradicts all those interpretations that trace the early elements of history into emotional objects like divine, worldly, natural conscience, freedom etc

 In short, consciousness is not life but life determines consciousness
 marks ne "darshan kii daridrata" main likhaa, ""ham kalpana karen ki apane bhautik uttaradhikaar main vaastavik itihaas, apane parthiv uttaradhikaar main, aisa aitihaasik uttaradhikaar he jisamen mat, pravarg, siddhanton ne apane ko abhivyakt kiya he
 Each doctrine has its own personal century in which it has revealed itself
 udhaaharan ke liye satta ke siddhant kii apni shatabdi 11veen rahi he, usee tarah jis tarah 18veen shatabdi vyaktvaad ke siddhant kii pradhanta kii rahi he
 Thus, arguably the century is a follow-up to the theory, the theory does not follow the century
 duusare shabdon main, siddhant itihaas ko banaata he, itihaas siddhant ko nahin banaata
 Now if we ask for the hope of protecting both history and theory, why did the theory of power emerge in the 11th century and why individualism in the 18th and power theory in the 18th or individualism in the 11th, or why both did not happen in the same century , Then we will inevitably be forced to go into detail of the then circumstances
 hamen jaananaa padegaa ki 11veen or 18veen shatabdi ke log kaise the, unki kramagat aavashyaktaayen kya thim
 Their powers of production, their mode of production, the raw materials from which they were produced, and finally the relationship between human and human beings, the relationships that arose from all these conditions of existence

 Along with this sequence of changes, the economic relations of human beings have also changed and developed
 itihaas ko utpaadan sambandhon ke paanch mukhya prakaar gyaat hai–aadim jativaadee, daspradhan, saamanti, poonjeewaadi or samaajawaadee
 The ideas and types of these systems, such as profits, wages and rents in capitalism, are not merely eternal, but merely theoretical expressions of the social relations of production
 bhautik parivesh main viksit honevaali thos aavashyaktaayen ek vyavastha se duusari vyavastha ke parivartan ke aitihaasik kram ko janm detii hai
 When the economic overlap breaks out due to internal contradictions, as socialist analysis claims to be happening in capitalism, then a new chapter in history begins
 is dharna ke anusaar manushya kii bhoomika kisi bhi prakaar niskriyata kii nahin sakriyata kii he
 As stated in the story of Angeles, freedom is a requirement of acceptance

 a mere man cannot increase his height with his hands
 kintu manushya ne un bhautik niyamon kaa raaj samajhakar udana sikh liya he jinke bina uskaa udana asambhav hota he
 Of course, human history is created, but not in its own way
 yah kahana ki yah vichaardhaara manushya par swaarth ke uddeshyon ko aropit karti he, is vichaar ko foohad bananaa he
 It would have been ridiculous if the theory had said that man always works for material selfishness
 kintu uskaa maatr itnaa aagrah he ki adarsh swarg se bane banaae nahin tapak padate kintu prastut paristhitiyon dwaara viksit hote hai
 Therefore, we have to find the reason why only idols were prevalent in the era, not others
 1890 main angeles ne likhaa, ""antatogatva itihaas ke rup ko nishchit karanevaale tatv vaastavik jivan main utpaadan or punarutpaadan he
 Neither Marx nor i have ever claimed more than this
 isliye agar koi isko is vaktavy main tod marodakar rakhata he ki aarthik tatv hi ekmaatr nirnaayak he, to vah use arthhin, vimoort or tarkarahit vaktavy bana detaa he

 "" In fact this view accepts that "" principles as soon as they establish their authority over the masses, they become material forces
 "" buniyadi taur par to ni:andeh iskaa aagrah he ki saamaajik parivartanon ke antim kaarnon ko ""darshan main nahin prayek vishisht yug ke arthshaastra"" main foondnaa hoga
 The truth is that initially there were "actions", not words

 An exception to this is ocular albinism, which migrates to offspring via X-linked inheritance

 More importantly, since surgery cannot restore any normal RPE or fovia, better binocular vision may not be achieved by surgery
 esotropia ke maamle main surgery dwaara drishy kshetra kaa vistaar karke drushti main madad mil sakati he
 Eyeglasses and other vision aids, large print materials and CCTV, as well as bright but oblique reading lights can help people with albinism, although their vision may not be fully recovered

 Different cultures have developed beliefs about people with albinism in cultures around the world
 is loksahitya main hanirahit myth se lekar khatarnaak andhvishwaas bhi shaamil he, jo maanav jivan ko prabhavit karte hai
 Cultural challenges can be expected mostly in areas where the number of people with pale skin and light hair exceeds the average phenotype of ethnic majority
 africa deshon jaise tanzania or burundi main haal ke varshon main elabino logon ko jaadu-tone se sambandhit hatyaon main abhootpurv vruddhi dekhi gai he
 The reason for this is that the body parts of albinos are used in the medicines sold by the sorcerers
 ikkisvin sadi ke dauraan africa main kai pramanikrut ghatnaayen ghati hai
 For example, in Tanzania, in September 2009, three people were charged with murdering a fourteen-year-old albino child and biting her leg to sell for witchcraft purposes

 However, given the singularity of albino animals, they have periodically received patronage of groups such as the albino squirrel preservation society
 aanshik elbinizam main twachaa par keval ek yaa ek se adhik dhabbe hote hai jinamein melanin kaa abhaav hota he
 Albinistic birds and reptiles, in particular, may have red and yellow or other colors present on their entire body or in the form of spots, as the presence of other pigments is unaffected by albinism, such as profirins, teridins, and sitiens
 Along with dietary carotenoid dyes

 The indo-european language family is the largest language family in the world
 hind-europea bhashaa parivaar main vishwa kii sainkadon bhashaayen or boliyaan sammilit hai
 Some of the modern indo-european languages are: Hindi, Urdu, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Persian, Bangla, Punjabi, Russian, etc
 ye sabhi bhashaayen ek hi aadim bhashaa se nikali he, use aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kaa naam de saktaa he
 It was very similar to Sanskrit, as if it were a primitive form of Sanskrit
 in bhashaaon kii visheshtaayen he ki sabhi pracheen hind-europea bhashaaon main sangya, sarvnaam, visheshan or kriya ke kai shabd-rup hote the, jo vaakya main inkaa vyakaranik rup dikhaate the
 Mostly these word-forms were formed by the suffix at the end of the word
 rozmarra kii chizon, sage-sambandhiyon, saamaanya jaanwaron, kriyaaon ke liye kaam aane vaale shabd is parivaar kii sabhi pracheen bhashaaon main ek duusare se bahut milte-julate the or is aadhaar par bhashavidon ne aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kii pariklpana kii
 The forms of the words of these different languages were similar because they were homogeneous words originating from the same ancient root
 neeche diye teble main kuch pracheen or nayi hind-europea bhashaaon kii aam shabdaawalee ke kuch shabd or pariklpit aadim-hind-europea kii punarrachana diye gayi hai 
 There are several branches of the indo-european family
 har shakha kii upashakha or usamen sammilit mukhya pracheen or aadhunik bhashaayen or unke mukhya desh neeche diye hue hai
 indo-european branches are mainly divided into two classes: the Ketum class and the Satam class
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : ky, gy or ghy, sparsh-sangharshi yaa sangharshi vyanjanon main badal gayi, jaise : c, ja, sa or sha
 Simultaneously, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: qu, g and g, merged into: a, c and d
 inamen baltic, slav, hind irani, armenian or albanian shakhan aati hai
 Sanskrit belongs to this category
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv vaise hi parirakshit rahe
 The consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Ky, Gy and Ghe, merged into: k, c and d
 inamen itelic, unani, keltic or germanik shakhan aati hai
 The Sanskrit word Arya meant noble and cultured
 isaliye puraane itiharakaron, jaise maks mular ne aadim- or aadhunik hind-europea bhashaa bolne vaali jatiyon kaa naam "arya" rakh diya
 Europeans liked this name very much and soon all the Europeans started describing their countries as the birthplace of ancient Aryans
 vishesh kar hitlar prachaarit kiya ki pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi germany hi he or arya kaa arth shuddh peedhee kaa manushya he, jisaki twachaa gori, qad lambaa, aankhe neeli or bal sunahare hai
 According to Hittler, the Germans are of the highest and almighty race, and the Jewish people in particular are of inferior and non-aryan race
 british logon ne prachaarit kiya ki lagbhag 1700 i
pus
 main hind-arya janajatiyon ne europe se aakar sindhu-ghati main akraman kiya or bharat kii deshi sindhu ghati sabhyataa ko ujaad diya or uske nivaasiyon kaa narsanhaar kiya or baad main bache-khuche logon ko das bana liya -- jinako rugveda main das or dasyu kaha gaya he 
 After the Jewish massacre of Hitler, the word "arya" is now used in a linguistic sense, not for race
 par abhi bhi itihaaskaar or bhashavid aaryon kii janmabhumi kii khoj kar rahe hai
 According to one ideology, the birthplace of the Aryans was in Central Asia, perhaps in southern Russia or around the Caspian Sea
 vahiin se unke kabeeley duniya ke kai deshon main pahunche
 The migration of the indo-aryan tribes to the Indian subcontinent took place slowly and quietly and there is no evidence of the "bloodshed" of British historians
 us vaqt tak sindhu-ghati sabhyataa yaa to bhukampon se yaa sindhu-saraswati nadiyon kii dhara main badlaav or sookhe kii vajah se khud hi tabah ho gayi thi
 These ideologies are nowadays considered by most of the world's linguists and historians
 madhya asia ke "kurgan kabr-tile" pracheen aaryon dwaara banaaye gayi maane jate hai
 According to another ideology, India is the birthplace of the ancient Aryans and from here the Aryan clan migrated to Europe and the rest of Asia
 is baat ko kai bhartiya or hindutv-vaadi maanate hai, par baaki duniya main is drushtikon kii koi kadra nahin he
 According to most linguists, the reconstructed words of the "primitive-indo-european" language indicate that the ancient Aryan birthplace was a large, temperate grass pasture
 vaise bhi bhartiya jalwaayu or pashu-pakshiyon ke shabdon ke liye unani, latin, german or anya hind-europea bhashaaon main milte julate shabd nahin milte, jaise mor, murga, baagh, hathi, aam, kelaa, pipal, bargad, neem, garm-mausam, ganda, bhens, chaaval, ityadi
 Simultaneously, the big cities in the Indus Valley Civilization, the consumption of fish, occurred in 2000 BC
 Before the complete absence of the horse and even later the very few remains of the horses, the pictures of their gods being different from those of the Vedic deities, their reverence for tigers and bulls whereas the Babbar-lion and cow are more mentioned in the Rigveda, in most of their cities
 Lack of Vedic yajna-fire-altar, etc
 indicates that its inhabitants were not Aryans

 Science has special knowledge of nature
 yadhyapi manushya pracheen samay se hi prakruti sambandhi gyaan praapt karata rahaa he, phir bhi vigyaan arvachin kaal kii hi dein he
 It started in this era and within a short time it has made great progress
 is prakaar sansar main ek bahut badi kranti hui or ek nai sabhyataa kaa, jo vigyaan par aadhaarit he, nirmaan hua
 The perfect method of testing the universe also developed slowly
 kisi bhi cheez ke bare main yon hi kuch bolne va tark-vitark karne ke bajaay behatar he ki us par kuch prayog kiye jaayen or uskaa saavdhaanee purvak nirikshan kiya jaay
 The results of this method are universal in the sense that one can test the data obtained by repeating those experiments
 satya ko asaty va bhram se alag karne ke liye ab tak avishkrut tareekon main vaigyanik vidhi sarvshereshth he
 In short, the scientific method works as follows: kisi vaigyanik siddhanth yaa pariklpana kii sabase bady visheshta yah he ki use asaty siddh karne kii gunjaaish honi chaiye
 While religious beliefs are such that there is no scope to disprove them
 udhaaharan ke liye 'jo jisas ke bataaye maarg par chalenge, keval ve hi swarg jaayenge' - isaki satyata kii jaanch nahin kii ja sakati
 The question is: who is responsible for the rapid progress of science? Did humans of ancient times have less intelligence than these archaic scientists? If this is the case, then why did the advancement of philosophy, literature and fine arts grow so much in ancient times? Perhaps its secret lies in the scientific methods, by which science has been able to progress so much
 arvachin vigyaan kaa aarambh lagbhag teen sau varsh purv hua
 As mentioned above, there was some advancement of science in ancient times, but its sequence could not progress further
 isliye kuch baat iske peeche avashya rahi hogi
 In fact, whatever knowledge the mystics acquired from ancient times, it would be right to call it intellectual
 apni buddhi or tark ke bal par gyaan kii ucch koti kii baaten unhone bataayin, kintu unke prakaar or vardhan kii vyavastha nahin thi or sansar bhar main unka vyapak prachaar or prasaaran nahin ho paaya arvachin vigyaan iske vipareet praayogic gyaan he, jiskaa aarambh main bada virodh hua
 As a result, leading scientists like Galileo had to endure severe torture
 phir bhi prayog dwaara satyaapan vidhi ke bheetar hi prasaaran kaa beej bhi chipa hua tha
 In this way, the knowledge gained was tied up in a series whose order continued
 is gyaan se shakti ke nae nae sroton kaa pataa chalaa or parinamswaroop na keval iskaa virodh kam hota gaya apitu ek bahut badi kranti samaaj main hui
 The machine era heralded and a new ray of hope emerged in the world
 kintu jis prakaar sabhi vastuon ke saath achchhai or buraai donon ke pahalu jude hue hai, vigyaan bhi maanav ke liye keval vardaan hi na rahaa, uskaa pashachik rup hiroshima main atum bam ke rup main vishwa ne dekha, jiske visphot ke kaaran sansar ke vinaash tathaa pralay kii lila kaa drishy upasthit ho gaya
 Thus, there was a need to not search for "truth only for truth" in front of the world and it was known to adopt the image of "satya Shivam Sundaram" in science world too
 vigyaan is prakaar niyantrit hokar hi maanav kalyaan main yogadan kar saktaa he
 This control resulted in atomic kilns, which are just controlled atom bombs, but which can provide immense facilities
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki alp kaal main hi vigyaan ne badi unnati kii or iskaa sab shrey prayogvidhi ko he, jiskaa upyog pracheen samay main nahin kiya gaya tha
 The importance of experiment is of paramount importance in this method, yet other methods are also used in a particular way and order, which we can call scientific methods
 vigyaan ke adhyayan main jin vidhiyon kaa upyog samuhik rup se athwa aanshik rup se kiya jaataa he, unka neeche varnan kiya ja rahaa he : Observation - Careful inspection of the natural object or phenomenon to be studied is first necessary
 yadi koi ghatana kshanik ho, to uskaa chithran kar lenaa aavashyak he, taaki baad main uskaa nirikshan ho sake, jaise grahan
 Microscopes or telescopes can be used for inspection, so that more detail can be inspected more precisely
 yadi anya log bhi nirikshan kaa kaary kar rahe hon, to uskaa swaagat karnaa chahie ki keval nirikshit vastu par hi dhyaan kendrit rahe, jaise arjuna ko vanvidya ke pareekshan ke samay keval pakshi kaa sir dikhaai pad rahaa tha
 Sometimes there is already some perception in the brain about which object, which is very obstructing in unbiased inspection
 nirikshan ke samay is prakaar kii dharanaon se unmukt hokar kaary karnaa chahie
 Description - Write a description of the object or event that is inspected as well as, or immediately after, the inspection
 iske liye nape-tule shabdon kaa prayog karnaa chahie, jisase padhanevaale ke saamne nirokshit vastu kaa chitra khinch jaae
 Wherever it is necessary, by estimation one should measure the quality of the object in the figures, but it should be done only when it is to be proved useful later
 phulon ke rang kaa varnan karte samay anumaanit tarangadairghy dena vyarth he, kintu kisi vastu kii kathorta kii tulana anya vastu kii apeksha ankon main dena hi thik he
 Vain details should not be given and the language should be simple and comprehensible
 desh, kaal evam vaataavaran kaa varnan de dena chahie taaki vastu kin paristhitiyon main uplabdh ho sakati he, yah gyaat ho sake
 Action-reason-deliberation - Explanation of action is important in the revelation of nature
 varsha kaa hona, badal kii garaj, bijli kii chamak, aandhi or tufaan aadi ghatnaayen saath ho sakati hai
 Who has so many reasons? Often the reason comes first, but only the sequence does not determine the cause
 isliye in baton par thodavichaar kar lenaa chahie, taaki aage kisi prakaar kaa bhram na paidaa ho
 Also, the sequence of various reasons should be tied
 ye sab baaten ghatana ko samajhane main sahaayak hoti hai
 Experimentation - The only credit for the rapid advancement in this age of science is to this method, because other methods have been built around this main method
 yah takanic is yug kii dein he
 Science could not progress in the absence of this in ancient times
 antarikshayatra ev parmanviya shakti kaa vikaas, isi prayogikaran ke kaaran, sambhav ho sakaa he
 What is the difference between experiment and simple inspection? Even in the experiment, there is the work of inspection
 vastav main saadhaaran nirikshan main prakruti ke saath kisi prakaar kaa dakhal nahin diya jaataa, kintu prayog main dakhal diya jaataa he
 As a result, such possibilities and situations emerge from which the inspection of the time of the experiment is very helpful in the revelation
 prayog satya jaanane ke liye kiye jate hai, kintu nirantar vaigyanik prayogon ke falswaroop aisi sthiti paidaa ho gai he ki keval satya ke hi naam par prayog karnaa shreyaskar nahin, yadi vah satya mangalakaari na ho
 What benefit is there from the truth that results in the destruction of the entire world
 isliye acha hi he ki is samay saare sansar main parmanviya pareekshan kaa virodh ho rahaa he
 These tests are being conducted by some nations only to find the truth, but as a result, radioactivity is increasing and may, in future, pose a huge threat to life
 prayog karte samay sachai or eemaandaaree baratani padati he
 Corrections and errors have to be taken care of
 anek vibhinnataaon ke adhyayan ke pashchaat koi parinaam nikaala jaataa he
 If something inconsistent is shown, it is not left out, but it is carefully considered
 kabhi-kabhi isi kram main bade-bade avishkaar hue hai
 The inspection is repeated several times and the mean result is emphasized
 takneekee bhashaa main vidhi, nirikshan evam parinaam kaa varnan kiya jaataa he
 Hypothesis - The sole purpose of experimenting is the opening of a mystery of nature

 The opposite happens in macroeconomics, which includes the sum total of activities related to growth, inflation, and unemployment
 sookshirthshaastra arthvyavastha ke purv main bataaye gaye pahaluon par rashtriya aarthik nitiyon ke prabhaavon kii bhi charchaa karata he
 Especially in view of Lucas's criticism, most modern macroeconomic theory has been constructed on the basis of basic assumptions regarding 'micro-base' - that is, micro-level behavior
 sookshirthshaastra kaa ek lakshya bazaar tantra kaa vishleshan karnaa he jo vastuon evam sevaaon ke bich saapeksh mulya kii sthapana or kai vaikalpik upyogon ke bich simit sansadhano kaa aavanton karata he
 Microeconomics analyzes market failure, where markets fail to produce impressive results, and it describes the theoretical stages required for full competition
 sookshirthshaastra main adhyayan ke mahatvapurn kshetron main saamaanya santulan, asamamit jaankaree ke antargat bazaar, anischitata ke antargat vikalp or khel siddhant ke aarthik anuprayog shaamil hai
 Elasticity of products within the market system is also considered
 aam taur par aapurti or maang kaa siddhant yah maanata he ki bazaar purna rup se pratisparddhaatmak hote hai
 This means that there are many buyers and sellers in the market and none have the ability to significantly affect the prices of goods and services
 kai vaastavik jivan ke lenden main, yah purvadharna vifal ho jaati he kyonki kuch vyaktigat kritaon yaa vikritaon main keemton ko prabhavit karne kii kshamta hoti he
 Often a well-modeled demand and supply equation requires a sophisticated analysis

 Mainstream economics does not presuppose a preference that markets are credible to other forms of social organization

 iskaa adhyayan samuhik kriya vaale kshetra main kiya jaataa he
 It should also be noted that "optimal welfare" generally takes the form of the Pareto related standard, which, in caldor-hicks's own mathematical application, is a collective action within the normative aspect of economics, that is, utilitarian standards that study public elections

 It is assumed that all firms are following rational decision making and they will produce on profit maximizing output
 Given this assumption, a firm's profit can be considered in four categories
 sookshirthshaastra main, "bazaar kii vifaltaa" shabd kaa yah arth nahin he ki ek die gaye bazaar ne kaamkaaj band kar diya he
 Rather, market failure is a situation in which a given market does not efficiently organize production or allocate goods and services to consumers
 arthshaastri saamaanya rup se is shabd ko un sthitiyon main lagu karte hai jahaan pratham kalyaan prameya vifal ho jate hai jisase ki bazaar parinaam ab parato kii seemaa main bilkul nahin rahete hai
 On the other hand, in a political context, stakeholders may use the term market failure to describe situations where market forces do not meet public interest

 i Since the time of the Australian economist Freedrick von Wijer, opportunity cost has been seen as the foundation of the marginal theory of value
 avasar laagat kisi vastu kii laagat ko maapne kaa ek tarika he
 Instead of just identifying the costs of a project or adding costs, one can also identify the next best alternative way to spend the same money

 a typical example is a farmer who chooses to cultivate his land instead of renting it to neighbors, which is a pre-determined benefit from renting opportunity costs

 Similarly, the opportunity cost of getting admission in the university is the lost wages, which a student could have earned through the workforce, rather than tuition, books and other essential items

 dhyaan den ki avasar laagat uplabdh vikalpon kaa yoga nahin hota he, balki bajaay ekal, sarvshereshth vikalp kaa laabh hota he
 The potential opportunity cost of the city's decision to build a hospital on its vacant land was the loss of land for a sports center, or the inability to use the land for parking, or the money that could be obtained by selling the land, or The loss of any one of the various other possible uses is - but not all, overall
 sahi avasar laagat un suchibadhon main se sabase laabhakaari vastu se purvanishchit laabh hoga
 Here a question arises that to evaluate its benefits one must determine the dollar value associated with each option to ease the comparison and evaluate the opportunity cost, depending on the items we compare By and large it can be difficult
