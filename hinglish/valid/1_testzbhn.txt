 answermeamsa one of the six Indian philosophies
 uttarmimasaa ko 'shaareerik mimasaa' or 'vedantadarshan' bhi kehete hai
 These names are from the text called Brahmasutra created by Badarayana
 mimasaa shabd kaa arth he anusandhan, gambhir, vichaar, khoj
 The Vedas were considered the ultimate proof in ancient India
 veda vaanmay bahut vistrut he or usamen yajna, upasna or gyaan sambandhi mantra paae jate hai
 They are divided into parts called Mantras, Brahmanas and aranyaka-upanishads
 bahut pracheen hone ke kaaran vedavakyon ke arth, prayog or paraspar sambandh samanvay kaa gyaan lupt ho jane se unke sambandh main anusandhan karne kii aavashyaktaa padi
 Jaimini coordinated the sentences under the mantra and Brahmin parts in his treatise Mimamsasutra
 mantra or brahman veda ke purvabhag hone ke kaaran unke arth or upyog kii mimasaa kaa naam purvamimasaa padaa
 The sentences of the Aranyaka and Upanishads in the northern part of the Vedas were co-ordinated by Badarayana in the texts called Brahmasutra and hence he got the name Uttamimamsa
 uttarmimasaa shaareerik mimasaa bhi is kaaran kehalaata he ki isamen sharirdhari aatma ke liye un sadhano or upasnaon kaa sanket he jinke dwaara vah apane brahmatv kaa anubhav kar saktaa he
 It was named Vedanta philosophy because it coordinated the subjects of the sentences of the last part of the Veda
 iskaa naam brahmamimasaa athwa brahmasutra is kaaran padaa ki isamen vishesh vishay brahm or uske swaroop kii mimasaa he, jabaki purvamimasaa kaa vishay yajna or dharmik krity hai
 Uttaraimamsa is not only a representation and co-ordination of the meaning of Vedic sentences, it also considers philosophical problems related to Jiva, the world and Brahman
 ek sarvangin darshan kaa nirmaan karke uskaa yuktiyon dwaara pratipaadan or usase bhinn matvaale darshanon kaa khandan bhi kiya gaya he
 Philosophically, this part is considered very important
 samast brahmasutra main chaar adhyay hai or prayek adhyay main chaar paad hai
 The first four sutras of the first chapter in the first chapter and the first and second feet of the second chapter cover almost all the things related to Vedanta philosophy
 inamen hi vedantadarshan ke upar jo akshep kiye ja sakate hai ve or vedant ko duusare darshanon main-purvamimasaa, buddha, jain, vaisheshik, pashupat darshanon main, jo us samay prachlit the-jo trutiyaan dikhaai detii hai ve aa jaati hai
 Because all the texts are in the form of subtle and hard formulas, it is not so simple that everyone can understand its meaning and consistency
 guru log in sutron ke dwaara apane shishyon ko upanishdon ke vichaar samajhaayaa karte the
 Over time, all his knowledge disappeared and there was a need to write commentaries on him
 sabase pracheen bhashya, jo is samay prachlit or prapya he, shri shankaracharya kaa he
 After Shankara and the Acharyas also wrote commentaries on the Brahmasutra to confirm the opinions of their sect and in accordance with their opinions
 shri ramanujacharya, shri madhwacharya, shri nimbarkacharya or shri vallabhacharya ke bhashya prakhyat hai
 The views of all these masters, despite being similar in some parts, are very different
 swayan baadaraayan ke vichaar kya hai, yah nishchit karnaa or kis acharya kaa bhashya baadaraayan ke vichaaron kaa samarthan karata he or unke anukool he, yah kahana bahut kathin he kyonki sutara bahut duruh hai
 This problem is also associated with this problem, what are the philosophical views of the Upanishads who have tried to coordinate in the Brahmasutra
 baadaraayan ne unako kya samajha or bhashyakaron ne unako kya samajha he? vahi bhashya adhiktar thik samajha janaa chahie jo upanishdon or brahmasutra donon ke anuroop ho
 From this point of view, Shri Shankaracharya's opinion seems more expedient
 kuch vidvan ramanujacharya ke mat ko adhik sutranukool batalaate hai
 The most special philosophical principle of Uttamimamsa is that the root world
 Chetan Brahm is the cause and cause of the cause
 jaise makadi apane bheetar se hi jaal taanati he, vaise hi brahm bhi is jagat ko apni hi shakti dwaara utpann karata he
 Not only this, he is its parent and he also destroys it
 jeev or brahm kaa tadatmya he or anek prakaar ke sadhano or upasnaon dwaara vah brahm ke saath tadatmya kaa anubhav karke jagat ke karmjanjaal se or barambar ke jivan or maran se mukt ho jaataa he

 Maharaja Suraj Mal was politically intelligent, visionary, handsome, shapely and healthy

 Later in 1760, there were some differences between Sadashiv Rao Bhau and Suraj Mal
 mathura kii nabi masjid ko dekhakar bhaau ne gusse main kaha - surajmal ji, mathura itane din se aapke kabje main he, phir is masjid ko aapane kaise chhod diya? surajmal ne jawaab diya - agar mujhe yakeen hota ki main sari umr is ilaake kaa badshaah rahoonga to shaayad main is masjid ko girava detaa, par kya phayda? kal musalmaan aakar hamaare mandiron ko giravaayen or vahiin par masjiden banavaa den to aapako acha lagegaa? baad main phir bhaau ne laal kile ke diwane-khaas kii chat ko girwane kaa hukum diya tha, yah soch kar ki is sone ko bechakar apane sainikon kii tankhwaah de duungaa
 On this too Surajmal refused him, even said that take five lakh rupees from me, but do not break it, after all Nadir Shah had also spared this roof
 par bhaau nahin mana - jab chat kaa sona todaa gaya to vah mushkil se teen lakh rupee kaa niklaa
 Bhau did not listen to many things about Surajmal and also said that - i have not come here from far south on the strength of your strength
 14 janvari 1761 main panipat kii teesri ladaai maraathon or ahmedshah abdali ke bich hui
 More than half of the one lakh soldiers of the Marathas were killed
 maraathon ke paas na to puraa rashan tha or na hi is ilaake kaa unhen bhed tha, kai-kai din ke bhukhe sainik kya yuddh karte ? agar sadashiv raav maharaja surajmal se choti-si baat par takaraar na karke use bhi is jang main saajheedaar banaata, to aaj bharat kii tasviir or hi hoti| maharaja surajmal ne phir bhi dosti kaa haq adaa kiya

 For ten days, Surajmal took him to Rakha in Bharatpur, administered his medicine and arranged food and clothes
 maharani kishori ne bhi janata se apil karke anaaj aadi icttha kiya
 It is heard that some twenty lakh rupees were spent in their service and water
 jate hue har aadmi ko ek rupaya, ek ser anaaj or kuch kapade aadi bhi diye taaki raste kaa kharch nikaal saken
 Some Maratha soldiers had also brought their families before the fighting and left them in the villages of Haryana
 unki maut ke baat unki vidhwaaen waapas nahin gayi
 Later, the family rode into the culture of Haryana

 Bikaner
 ek almast shahar he, almast isliye ki yahan ke log beficri ke saath apana jivan yaapan karte hai
 The reason for this is also that Rao Bikaji, the founder of Bikaner, was of an excellent nature
 almast nahin hote to ve jodhpur rajya kii gaddi ko yon hi baat-baat main nahin chhod dete 
 Two stories are popular in the world behind it
 ek to yah ki, napa saankhla jo ki bikaaji ke mamaa the unhone jodhaji se kaha ki aapane bhale hi santal ji ko jodhpur kaa uttaradhikari banaaya kintu bikaaji ko kuch sainik sahaayta sahit sarunde kaa patta de dijiye
 He is brave and rich in luck
 vah apane boote khud apana rajya sthapit kar legaa
 Jodhaji accepted Napa's advice and gave Patta, including fifty soldiers, to Napa
 bikaaji ne yah faisla raji khushi maan liya
 At that time, Kandhalji, Rupa ji, Mandal ji, Nathu ji and Nanda ji, these five chieftains who were the real brothers of Jodha as well as Napa Sankhala, Bela Padihar, Lala Lakhan Singh Baid, Chauthmal Kothari, Nahar Singh Bachavat, Vikram Singh Purohit, Salu Many people like Ji Rathi etc
 supported Bikaji

 Salu ji Rathi was a resident of village Onsia in Jodhpur

 Even today, his descendants do Holika Dahan on Holi's Holi
 saale kaa arth bahan ke bhai ke rup main na hokar saalu ji ke apbhransh ke rup main hota he The second story behind the establishment of Bikaner is that one day Rao was sitting in the Jodha Durbar, Bikaji came late to the court and bowed down and talked slowly to his uncle Kandhal
 yah dekh kar jodha ne vyangy main kaha “ maaloom hota he ki chachaa-bhatija kisi naveen rajya ko vijit karne kii yojana bana rahe hai’
 On this, Becca and Kandhal said that if you are pleased then this will happen
 or isi ke saath chachaa – bhatija donon darbar se uth ke chale aaye tathaa donon ne bikaner rajya kii sthapana kii
 a folk doha is also prevalent in this regard, 'fifteen hundred Pantalwe, Sud Baisakh Sumer Thavar Bij Tharapio, Bika Bikaner' Thus Bikaner was established with the response of a taunt
 raav bika - bikaner ke sansthaapak Rao Narsi - son of Rao Bika raav lunkaran :-apane bade bhai raav narsi kii mrityu ke baad lunkaran shaasha bana

 He originally wrote it in Urdu under the name 'bajare-hussan' but first published its Hindi form 'sevasadan'

 Premchand had started a revolutionary change in Hindi fiction by making Surdas, a blind beggar, a hero of fiction in Rangbhoomi
 godaan kaa hindi sahitya hi nahin, vishwa sahitya main mahatvapurn sthaan he
 In it, Premchand's literary ideology achieves perfection from 'idealistic realism' to 'critical realism'
 ek saamaanya kisaan ko puure upanyaas kaa nayak bananaa bhartiya upanyaas parampara kii disha badal dene jaisaa tha
 The death of Hori, a storyline trapped in the cycle of feudalism and capitalism, shakes the minds of readers

 But Godan's tactful ending is a witness to the fact that Premchand was disillusioned with idealism by then
 yah unki aakhri daur kii kahaniyon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 Mangalasutra is an unfinished novel of Premchand

 premchand ji kii lokapriy kahaniyaan Premchand composed the plays 'sangram', 'karbala' and 'prem ki Vedi'
 ye naatak shilp or samvednaa ke str par achche hai lekin unki kahaniyon or upanyaason ne itani oonchaai praapt kar lee thi ki naatak ke kshetra main premchand ko koi khaas safalataa nahin mili
 These plays have become really interactive novels

 Premchand came to Hindi with the rite of Urdu and became a great Hindi writer
 hindi ko apana khaas muhaavara or khulaapan diya
 Both the story and the novel made epoch-making changes
 unhone sahitya main samayikta prabal aagrah sthapit kiya
 He made the common man the subject of his creations and, by openly penning his problems, placed him on the post of heroes of literature
 premchand se pehle hindi sahitya raja-rani ke kisson, rahasy-romaanch main ulajhaa hua tha
 Premchand took literature to the surface of truth
 unhone jivan or kalkhand kii sachai ko panne par utaara
 He continued to write for a lifetime on communalism, corruption, zamindari, indebtedness, poverty, colonialism
 premachand kii zyaadaatar rachanaaen unki hi garibi or dainyata kii kahani kahati he
 It is also not wrong that he was the creator of the common Indian
 unki rachanaaon main ve nayak hue, jise bhartiya samaaj achhut or ghrunit samajha tha
 He used the language of simple, easy and common language and presented his progressive ideas strongly to the society

 Premchand is the era promoter of Hindi literature
 unhone hindi kahani main aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad kii ek nai parampari shuru kii
 Despite being such a great creator, Premchand's life is not free from accusations
 premchand ke adhyeta kamalkishor goyanka ne apni pustak 'premchand : adhyayan kii nai dishaaen' main premchand ke jivan par kuch aarope lagaakar unke sahitya kaa mahatv kam karne kii koshish kii
 The main allegations against Premchand are- Premchand left his first wife without any reason and even after second marriage, he had a relationship with another woman, Premchand cheated Vinodashankar Vyas in 'jagran Brawl', Premchand's senior press Employee Pravasi Lal Verma Frauded, Workers Strike in Premchand's Press, Premchand Supports Flick When His Daughter Sick Took more
 kamalkishor goyanka dwaara lagaae gaye ye aarope premchand ke jivan kaa ek paksh jarur hamaare saamne laate hai jisamen unki insaani kamajoriyon jaahir hoti hai lekin unke vyapak sahitya ke moolyankan par in aaropon kaa koi asar nahin pad paaya he
 Premchand is often known as "munshi Premchand"
 premchand ke naam ke saath 'munshi' kab or kaise jud gaya? is vishay main adhikansh log yahi maan lete hai ki prarambh main premchand adhyaaapak rahe
 The teachers were often called Munshi ji at that time
 iske atirikt kaaysthon ke naam ke pehle sammaan swaroop 'munshi' shabd lagane kii parampara rahi he
 Probably, the word Munshi became rigid with the name of Premchand ji
 professor shukdev singh ke anusaar premchand ji ne apane naam ke aage 'munshi' shabd kaa prayog swayan kabhi nahin kiya
 He also believes that the word Munshi is a sign of respect, which fans of Premchand may have once imposed
 yah tathy anumaan par aadhaarit he
 But the authentic reason for adding the Munshi adjective to Premchand's name is that the letter 'hans' used to co-edit Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 jisaki kuch pratiyon par kanhaiyalaal munshi kaa puraa naam na chhapakar maatr 'munshi' chapa rahata tha saath hi premchand kaa naam is prakaar chapa hota tha- 
 Editor Munshi, premchand'hans' editors were Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 parantu kalantar main pathakon ne 'munshi' tathaa 'premchand' ko ek samaj liya or 'premchand'- 'munshi premchand' ban gaye
 It's but natural
 saamaanya pathak praaia: lekhak kii kritiyon ko padhata he, naam kii sookshmata ko nahin dekha karata
 Today, Premchand's ornamentation of Premchand has become so orthodox that it is only by 'munshi' that Premchand's realization is made and by not saying 'munshi', Premchand's name seems incomplete
 premchand ne apni kala ke shikhar par pahunchne ke liye anek prayog kiye
 In the era in which Premchand took the pen, there was no solid legacy behind him nor was there any model of thought and progress, except in Bengali literature
 us samay bankim babu the, sharathchandra the or iske alaava tollstoy jaise rusi sahityakar the
 But by the time he composed a classic novel like Godan which is considered a modern classic
 unhone chizon ko khud gadha or khud aakaar diya
 When the freedom movement of India was going on, the expression he gave to both Hindi and Urdu languages through narrative literature gave rise to political stirring, passion and movement to all and made him powerful and this also made his writing powerful

 Punctuality may indicate the following: aar ke narayan kaa puraa naam rasipuram krishnaswami ayyar narayanswami tha
 Narayan is considered among the three greatest novelists among Indian writers of English literature
 mulkraj anand tathaa raja raav ke saath unka naam bhartiya angreji lekhan ke aarambhik samay main 'brihattrayee' ke rup main prasiddh he
 Adopting primarily novel and storytelling, he has set a creative record through his serious realism, expressing the saga of human rise and fall in various levels and forms
 aar ke narayan kaa puraa naam raashipuram krishna swaminarayan tha
 He is also taken by adding the traditional family title 'iyer' to it
 narayan ke pita ek tamil adhyaaapak the, jinhone apana adhikansh samay mysore ke shant shahar main bitaayaa tha
 Narayan, apart from working as a teacher and journalist for a very short time, devoted his entire life to writing
 aar ke narayan mysore ke yadavgiri main kareeb do dashak tak rahe
 In 1990, he shifted to Chennai due to illness
 inke dwaara rachit ek upanyaas guide ke liye unhen san 1960 main sahitya academy puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 He has done many of his own works by making Malgudi a fictional city
 malgudi ko praayah dakshin bharat kaa ek kaalpanik kasbaa mana jaataa he; parantu swayan lekhak ke kathananusaar "agar main kahoon ki malgudi dakshin bharat main ek kasbaa he to yah bhi adhuri sachai hogi, kyonki malgudi ke lakshan duniya main har jagah mil jaayenge
 " unka pehla upanyaas swami or uske dost 1935 i0 main prakashit hua
 The novel has a very entertaining description of Swaminathan, a schoolboy, and the title of the novel is an abbreviation of Swami's own name
 is upanyaas ke sheershak main hi vyangy sannihit he
 The title completely destroys what the reader expects of the story
 yah swami aisa ladkaa he jo skool main varg main anupasthit rahakar head master ke daftar kii khidakiyon ke shishe todta he or agle din sawaal kiye jane par koi jawaab nahin de paata he to bevakoofon kii tarah takate rahata he or saraasar peeth par bent padane par tathaa desk par khadey kiye jane par achaanak kudakar kitaaben uthaa kar yah kehete hue bhaag nikalataa he ki 'main tumhaare gande skool kii parvaah nahin karata'
 Similarly, Swami's story describes the common mischief of a boy and the punishments found in lieu of it
 kintu lekhak use bade mazaakia lahaze main kisi ladke ke man ko puri tarah samajhate hue kehete hai
 Being an early novel, Narayan is not able to give a complete introduction to creative maturity in terms of the discomfort experienced with increasing age and the feeling of passage of time, but it is quite successful in bringing the whole freshness of childhood into the narrative
 Occur
 'snaatak' 1935 i0 main prakashit hua
 It is the story of Chandan, a sensitive young man who presents the duality between the Western ideas about love and marriage acquired by his education and the social structure in which he lives
 da dark room bhi dainandin jivan kii choti-choti baton or ghatnaon ke vivaran se buni kahani he
 In this, there is the story of a traditional woman named Savitri who endures all the sufferings silently
 uskaa pati duusari kaamkaaji mahila kii ore aakarshith hota he or is baat se aahat hone ke baavjood antat savitri saamanjasy sthapit karke hi rahati he
 However, it is not the case that the story is told in a flat form
 bhaawanaaon kaa bimb ukerne main lekhak ne kushalta kaa parichay diya he
 Savitri fights and also leaves the house in despair caused by her husband not leaving the other woman
 niraashaa kii is sthiti main use mahasoos hota he ki swaavlamban ke yogya banane par hi jivan vastav main jivan hota he
 Otherwise "what is the difference between a prostitute and a married woman? - Only that the prostitute keeps changing and the wife clings to one

 But, finally realizing the futility, frustration and weakness of all this, she gives up and then decides to return home

 The author's last novel, The English Teacher, was published in 1946 before independence
 yah upanyaas america main 'greatful tu life and deth' sheershak se prakashit hua tha
 In it, the writer has chosen a story after which the excerpt has become unbelievable
 kahani ke aarambh main ghar or ghar kii lakshmi arthath patni ke prati prem purna vyavhaar kaa uttam nidarshan he, lekin kahani ke uttaransh main us patni ke nidhan ho jane ke baad uski aatma se sampark sthapit kar lene kii baaten aayi hai, jo ki rachanaatmak str par avishwasaneey si lagati he
 In fact, Narayan has three levels of creativity
 unki rachanaatmak shreshthata kaa 'swarnyug' bhartiya swatantraaa ke baad aayaa
 From 1952 AD to 1962 AD, the period of more than a decade was the golden age of his creativity
 isse pehle or iske baad ke samay ko spasht vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 The trilogy of author's novels followed in this period of creative maturity
 ye teen upanyaas the- da financiel export, guide tathaa malgudi kaa aadamkhor 
 Awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1960, 'guide' is the pinnacle of Narayan's creativity
 ise unka shreshthatam upanyaas mana gaya he
 His satirical vision is not connected to such sharp and moral concerns anywhere else, nor is the technique so subtle
 'malgudi kaa aadamkhor' main lekhak ne apane naitik sarokaar ko bhasmasur kii pracheen puranic niti katha ke sandarbh ko rachanaatmak rup main aadhuniktaa ke saath punar srujit kar abhivyakt kiya he
 This modern Bhasmasura is a selfish, eerie and ungodly Uddand Vasu, a straw-filler in animal skins, who is ambushed to shoot the temple elephant, but spontaneously kills a fly hovering near his forehead
 In an attempt, he kills himself by being fired
 hasya mishrit vyangy kaa bhi lanbaa vivaran kahin-kahin lekhak ne diya he
 For example, when asked by an astrologer about half a good date, what could be the obstacle, the astrologer says that the thumb may be hurt, or the milk for coffee may turn sour, or the water running in the tube suddenly
 Be closed spashtatah lekhak yahaan jyotish ke uttam paksh ko bilkul nazarandaaj karte hue prachlit paakhand ke rup main uskaa majaak udaate hai
 There is a Gandhian struggle in the 'mahatma's Waiting' published between the above mentioned Upanishadic Brihatrayi and in the background of 'the Vendor of Sweets' later published
 'mahatma kaa intjaar' is baat kaa adhyayan he ki gandhivadi kranti kii bhartiya jan saadhaaran par kisi pratikriya hui
 This study has been completed as a complete creative work away from political propaganda
 'da vendor of sweets' ke 9 saal baad 1976 main 'da painter of sinz' kaa prakaashan hua

 Bhoj was the ninth king of the Panwar or Parmar dynasty
 parmaar vansheey raajaaon ne malwa kii rajdhani dharanagari se aathvin shatabdi se lekar chaudaavin shatabdi ke purvardh tak rajya kiya tha
 Bhoja made many wars and established his reputation, which proves that he had extraordinary merit
 yadhyapi unke jivan kaa adhikansh yudhakshetra main beetaa tathaapi unhone apane rajya kii unnati main kisi prakaar kii baadha na utpann hone di
 He built many temples in the cities and villages of Malwa, though very few of them are known now
 kaha jaataa he ki vartmaan madhyapradesh kii rajdhani bhopal ko raja bhoj ne hi basaaya tha, tab uskaa naam bhopal nagar tha, jo ki kaalaantar main bhoopal or phir bhopal ho gaya
 Raja Bhoj had built a sea-like pond near Bhojpal Nagar, which went to the huge Shiva temple of Bhojpur in the east and south
 aaj bhi bhojpur jate samay, raste main shivmandir ke paas us talab kii pattharon kii bani vishaal paal dikhti he
 At that time the water of that pond was considered very holy and curing diseases
 kaha jaataa he ki raja bhoj ko charm rog ho gaya tha tab kisi rishi yaa vaidya ne unhen is talab ke pani main snaan karne or use pine kii salaah di thi jisase unka charmrog thik ho gaya tha
 The huge Shivling installed in the Shiv temple was also anointed with the water of that huge pond
 raja bhoj swayan bahut bade vidwaan the or kaha jaataa he ki unhone dharm, khagol vidya, kala, koshrachana, bhavannirmaan, kavy, aushadhashastra aadi vibhinn vishyon par pustaken likhi hai jo ab bhi vidyaman hai
 In his time, poets got shelter from the state
 unhone san 1000 i
 se 1055 i
 tak rajya kiya
 Due to his scholarship, a proverb became popular in the public where Raja Bhoj and Gangu Teli
 bhoj bahut bade vir, pratapi, or gungrahi the
 He conquered many countries and produced many texts of many subjects
 ye bahut achche kavi, darshanik or jyotishi the
 Many texts like Saraswati Kantabharan, Shringaramanjari, Champuramayan, Charuchara, Tattvaprakash, Behavansamuchya etc
 are written in this
 inaki sabha sadaa bade bade panditon se sushobhit rahati thi
 His wife's name was Lilavati, who was a great student
 jab bhoj jivit the to kaha jaataa tha- is; Saraswati is always alive; All pundits are respected
 ) When he died, it was said - raja bhoj munj ke chote bhai sindhuraj ke putr the
 Rohak was his prime minister and Bhuvanpal minister
 kulchandra, sarh tathaa taraditya inke senapati the jinaki sahaayta se bhoj ne rajyasanchalan sucharu rup se kiya
 Like his uncle Munj, he also wanted to establish an empire in western India and to fulfill this desire, he had to fight with his neighboring states in every direction
 munj kii mrityu shokajanak paristhiti main ho jane se parmaar bahut hi uttejit the or isiliye parmaar bhoj chalukyon se badla len ke vichaar se dakshin kii ore sena lekar chadhaai karne ko prerit hue
 He attacked the treaty with Kalburi Gangaideva of Dahl and Rajendra Chola of Tanjore as well as the south, but the then king Chalukya Jaisingh II bravely confronted and saved his kingdom
 san 1044 i
 ke kuch samay baad jaisingh ke putr someshwar dwitiya ne parmaron se phir shatruta kar lee or malwa rajya par akraman kar bhoj ko bhaagane ke liye baadhya kar diy
 After taking possession of Dharanagari, he set fire, but a few days later Someshwar left Malav and Bhoja regained power after plunging into the capital
 san 1018 i
 ke kuch hi pehle bhoj ne indrarath naamak ek vyakti ko, jo sambhavat: kaling ke gang raajaaon kaa samant tha, haraaya tha After ending the war with Jai Singh II and Indrath, Bhoja moved his army towards the countries bordering the western border of India and first attacked the kingdom called Lat, which extended south to Surat under the Bombay state
 vahaan ke raja chalukya kirtiraj ne aatmasamarpan kar diya or bhoj ne kuch samay tak usapar adhikaar rakhaa
 After this, in about 1020 AD, Bhoja attacked Konkan, located south of Lat and extending from Thana district to Malagar beach and defeated the king of Shilharas named Arikeshri
 konkan ko parmaron ke rajya main mila liya gaya or unke saamanton ke rup main shilaharon ne yahan kuch samay tak rajya kiya
 In 1008 AD, when Mahmud Ghaznabi invaded a kingdom called Punjabi Shahi, Bhoja sent his army along with other states of India to oppose the invader and help Shahi Anandpal, but no result of this reconciliation of Hindu kings
 He did not come out and was defeated on this occasion
 san 1043 i
 main bhoj ne apane bhritibhogi sipaahiyon ko punjab ke musalamaanon ke viruddh ladane ke liye dilli ke raja ke paas bheja
 At that time Punjab was a part of Ghazni empire and only the descendants of Mahmud were ruling there
 dilli ke raja ko bharat ke anya bhaagon kii sahaayta mili or usne punjab kii ore kooch karke musalamaanon ko haraaya or kuch dinon tak us desh ke kuch bhaag par adhikaar rakhaa parantu ant main gazani ke raja ne use haraakar khoyaa hua bhaag pun: apane samrajya main mila liya
 Bhoja also once marched against Kalachuri Gangaideva of Dahl, who had supported him at the time of the invasion of the south
 gangeyadev haar gaya parantu use aatmasamarpan nahin karnaa padaa
 Shortly before 1055 AD, Ganga's son Karna entered into a treaty with Chaulukya Bhima i of Gujarat and attacked the Malavas from the east and the west
 bhoj apana rajya bachaane kaa prabandh kar hi rahaa tha ki beemaari se uski aakasmik mrityu ho gai or rajya sugamawa se akramanakariyon ke adhikaar main chalaa gaya
 In the north Bhoja also invaded the country of the Chandelas where a king named Vidyadhar ruled
 parantu usase koi laabh na hua
 The Bhoja's attempt to conquer Gwalior did not have any good result because the king of Kachhapaghat Kirtiraj faced his attack firmly
 aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki bhoj ne kuch samay ke liye kannauj par bhi vijay paa lee thi jo us samay pratihaaron ke patan ke badwaale parivartan kaal main tha
 Bhoja also declared war against the Shakhambari's Chahmanas in Rajasthan and defeated the then King Chahaman Seenram
 iske baad usne chaahmaanon ke hi kul ke anhil dwaara shaalit nadul naamak rajya ko jeetne kii dhamkee di, parantu yuddh main parmaar haar gaye or unke pradhan senapati sarh ko jivan se haath dhonaa padaa
 Bhoja also fought for a long time with the Chaulukyas of Gujarat, who built their capital at Anhilapattan
 chalukya solanki naresh mulraj pratham ke putr chanmudraj ko varanasi jate samay malwa main parmaar bhoj ke haanthon apamaanit hona padaa tha
 His son and successor Ballabhraj got very angry on this and thought to avenge this insult
 usne bhoj ke viruddh ek badi sena taiyaar kii or bhoj par akraman kar diya, parantu durbhagyavash raste main hi chechak se uski mrityu ho gai
 After this, Vallabhraj's younger brother Rare Raj took the reins of power in his hands
 kuch samay baad bhaaj ne use bhi yuddh main haraaya
 During the reign of Bhima's successor Bhima, Bhoja sent his commander Kulchandra to wage war against Gujarat
 kulchandra ne puure pradesh par vijay praapt kii tathaa uski rajdhani anhilapattan ko lutaa
 Bhima once invaded Abu and defeated his king Parmar Dhandu when he had to flee and seek refuge in Bhit in Chitrakoot
 jaisaa upar bataaya ja chukaa he, san 1055 i
 ke thode hi pehle bhim ne kalchuri karn se sandhi karke malwa par akraman kar diya tha parantu bhoj ke rahete ve us pradesh par adhikaar na paa sake
 Raja Bhoj was very brave and majestic, as well as Prakand Pandit and virtuous
