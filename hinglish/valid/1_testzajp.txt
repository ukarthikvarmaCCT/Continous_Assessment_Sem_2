 Neutrino This is a new particle which was first invented by Pauli in 1930
 is kan kaa pratham saidhantik aadhaar prasiddh bhautikeevid fermi ne san 1934 main batalaaya
 The properties of neutrinos are summarized as follows: un abhikriyaaon kii, jinase beta kirane milti he, jaanch karte samay yah dekha gaya ki nikle hue kanon kaa urja varnakram elfaa kiran ke urja varnakram se bhinn he
 Alpha rays meet in a different line spectrum, but beta rays emulate a completely different type of spectral spectrum
 radium-i ke liye praapt beta kiran kaa urja varnakram chitra main dikhaaya gaya he
 The energy of beta rays can be any value between zero and maximum value ea
 aisa hi santat varnakram un abhikriyaaon main bhi miltaa he jinase pozitron praapt hote hai
 Stabilizing the theoretical basis of the spectral spectrum given by beta rays remained a difficult problem for a long time
 maan liya jaay ki kisi nabhik k se, jo ek vishesh urja ke tal par he, ek beta kiran nikalati he or is abhikraya dwaara ek doosraa nabhik kha banataa he, jo pun: ek vishesh urja ke tal par he
 According to the theory of Puja and energy stability: the energy of the emitted beta particle should be equal to the difference between the energy cells of nucleus a and B
 yah urja siddhant sarvada E=mc2 ke tulya praapt hoti he
 From the test, particles emit energy of all values from zero to e = mc2
 aisa prathit haata he ki aisi abhikriyaaon main urja kaa kuch ansh lupt ho jaataa he or punj evam urja sthirataa ke siddhant kaa atikaraman hota he
 Fermi first successfully solved this problem by giving his neutrino subconception after beta rays
 unhone yah suzav diya ki beta kiran dene vaali abhikriyaaon main ek or kan nutrino bhi praapt hota he or vahi lupt prathit hone vaali urja ko grahan kar letaa he
 Till date, the neutrino has not been identified by examination, consequently its properties should be such that its identification is very difficult
 isaliye yah dharna kii gai ki nutrino aavesh rahit he or iskaa bhaar electron kii tulana main atinune he, shunaya ke hi lagbhag he
 Neutrino's charge is in accordance with the principle of charge for the reaction of a beta ray
 nutrino pariklpana ke anusaar, beta kiran abhikriya main praapt hui urja kii maatra ir a he
 This energy is received by the beta particles neutrinos and the rebound nucleus
 teen kanon main urja vibhaajan anekanek bhanti ho saktaa he, isaliye santat varnakram ban jaataa he
 When a beta ray is received from a nucleus, then the charge of the nucleus changes by unit, then the charge of the nucleus changes by unit, the weight remains unchanged
 yadi ek electron praapt ho, to nabhik ke proton kii sankhya main ikai kii vruddhi hoti he tathaa clebanu ikai dwaara sankhya ikai dwaara kam ho jaati he
 In the same way if a positron is obtained in a beta ray reaction, then the proton number decreases by unit and the cleban number increases by unit
 in beta roopantaron ko nimnlikhit dhang se spasht kiya ja saktaa he: In these reactions, neutrons are not considered to be made up of protons, electrons and neutrinos
 beta-utsarjan ke samay, neutron kaa teen kanon main tatkshan parivartan ho jaataa he
 a similar withdrawal occurs in protons in beta + emission
 evam samikarnon dwaara nutrino ke anya gunon ke bare main bhi soochna milti he
 Only when the angular capacity h / 2 is assumed does the law of its stability occur exactly
 usee bhanti, sankhyikee ke bare main bhi soochna milti he
 If the stability of the statistic is seen in the equation and this rule is true only if the neutrino follows the fermi-dirac statistic
 meson ke apkshay kii samasyaon ko hal karne ke liye bhi nutrino pariklpana kaa prayog kiya gaya
 Like a beta-ray reaction, the laws of heat and energy stability are broken when a mu-meson is converted into an electron
 in niyamon kii satyata ke liye nimnlikhit vidhi batalaai gai : Similarly, alpha-meson weathering can be shown by the following equation
 evam samikarnon ke viruddh koi samparikshawya sakshya nahin he In this way, the problems of beta rays and mesons have been resolved by neutrinos
 is kan ke liye sabhi sakshya abhi tak apratyaksh hi hai

 Now the actual ruling parliament in England became

 With this the sovereignty of the Parliament was accepted and the supreme power of the king was abolished

 Sovereignty was accomplished in the king's theory, but in practice Parliament became paramount
 daivi siddhanton amaanya or sansad ke vyapak adhikaar - is kranti ne raja ke daivi adhikaron ko amaanya kar diya
 The king's authority to repeal any law passed by the Parliament was over

 This revolution made it clear that protecting civil liberties, enacting laws and levying taxes were within the purview of Parliament
 raja sansad ke adhikaron main kisi bhi prakaar se hastkshep nahin kar saktaa tha

 dharmik kshetra main bhi yah spasht kar diya gaya ki anglican dharm england kaa vaastavik dharm he
 The king's authority over the church was abolished
 dharm ke maamalon main bhi sansad kaa uttaradayitv ho gaya
 This eventually created an atmosphere of religious tolerance in England
 sansad dwaara grih or videsh-niti kaa nirdhaaran : ab tak raja desh kii grih or videsh nitiyon kaa swayan sanchaalan karata tha
 He was inspired by his personal interests
 desh ke hiton kii upeksha kii jaati thi
 Due to this, the foreign policy adopted by the king at many times remained fruitless
 kintu kranti ke baad grih or videsh niti kaa nirdhaaran sansad ke paramashar or sweekruti se kiya jane laga
 This increased England's international prestige and expanded its colonial empire

 Due to the difficult journey and illness, he stayed for rest in the last leg of the journey, the village of his paternal grandmother Salma Bint Amr, who was in Medina, and the convoy left him behind and left for Mecca City
 After receiving news of Abdullah's illness by the caravan, Hazrat Abdul Mutallib sent his elder son al-harit to Medina, but after leaving there al-harit learned that his brother had died a month after the illness

 " Muhammad was a monogram for 25 years

 yah girjaghar barsilona spain main sthit he
 It was built by Antony Gaudí

 In November 2010, Pope Benedict Sohve declared it as a small holy church
 sagrada familia kaa nirmaan kaary 1882 main shuru hua tha
 World-renowned architecture expert Antony Gowdy joined it in 1883
 gaudi ne iske nirmaan or yojana style ko gothil or aadhunil kaal ke golaaidaar-lakiri aakaaron ke mishran se ek nayaa aayam diya
 He spent the last year of his life in this project and when he died in 1926 at the age of 73, less than the project was completed
 sagrada familia kaa nirmaan dhimi raftaar se aage badhata gaya kyonki use niji daan par nirbhar hona pad rahaa tha or ek badi baadha spain ke grih yuddh ke rup main utpann hui thi
 From the 1950s onwards, things became faster or sometimes slower
 2010 tak aadha nirmaan ho chukaa tha
 It is speculated that the entire construction will be finished in 2026, a full hundred years after Gaudi's death

 According to art-lover Rainer Zebast, no building like this church will be found in the history of the whole world

 Construction is expected to be completed around 2026 according to an estimate, marking the completion of a hundred years since the death of its chief architect Gaudí, while the project information sheet states a completion date in 2028 
 is pariyojna ko 1992 ke barsilona olympic khel se kaafii dhan kii prapti hui or kai paryatakon ne isamen apana vyaktigat yogadan diya tha
 CAD / CAM, ie computer-aided design technology, has been used to accelerate construction, while it was previously estimated to be several hundred years of work, based on the available manufacturing technology introduced in the 20th century

 Earlier in the 20th century, stones were dug by hand

 One of the main reasons behind the moratorium was that the original construction plan of Gaudí should be respected, which, although it did not fully contain the details and was partially destroyed, was reintroduced in recent times
 The addition was presented to the world in an honorable form

 Spain's Ministry of Public Works, putting many evidences to the public, clearly claimed that they did not see any danger to the church from the project

 inamen shaamil kai bishap or padariyon ne vishesh rup se haath uthaakar apane prabhu isa messiah se prathanaayen kii thi
 On 19 April 2011, a disruptive person set a small fire in the main hall, forcing many tourists and construction workers to leave
 girjaghar main pavitrataa kaa mukhya pratik nasht ho gaya or aag ko badi hi kathinaayee se pantalis minute ke agni-rakshak dal ke parishram ke pashchaat qaabu paa liya gaya tha
 The style of La Sagrada Familia displays variously long-lived Spain's Gothic architecture, Catalan modernity and Art Nouveau or Catalan nucentism
 haalanki sagrada familia art novyuu avadhi ke bheetar aata he, nicholas pevsner or glasgo ke charles reni makintosh bataate hai ki gaudi ne art novyuu ko saamaanya prayog se kahin dur le jaakar ek farsh kii sajaavat tak simit nahin rakhaa balki imaarat kii vaastukala kaa ek abhinn ang bana diya
 Although the creation of the Sagrada Familia was never aimed or aimed at making it a cathedral-like cathedral or bishop's workplace, La Familia Sagrada was planned from its earliest times as a cathedral-like cathedral-shaped complex
 jamini-str par yojana is tarah thi jaise ki spain ke duusare girjaghar jaise ki bergos cathedral, leone cathedral or seville cathedral pehle se nirmit the
 The Sagrada Familia is less than the breadth of all of them, despite having various similarities with Catalan and many other European Gothic cathedral-like churches, such as reduced window space, reduced walking area for prayer, seven doors
 Including being together, having more number of towers, having three seating areas and varying the size of all three, different decorations of different sites, etc
 Huh
 jahaan bade girjagharon ke liye apane aasapaas chote girjaghar or aitihaasik imaaraton kaa hona ek aam baat he, sagrada familia kaa nirmaan hatakar he kyonki yah qareeb-qareeb kii deevaaron or tang raaston se ghira padaa he jo ek band chaukor kaa aakaar lete hue teenon pravesh sthalon ek prakaar se math jaisi imaaraton kaa pratik bane hue hai
 This particular feature has been influenced by Villar's style in the plan, making it clear that Gaudi's construction plan is not in any way different from the traditional church architecture
 gaudi ke mul aakaar anusaar atharah spayer hone chahie jo oonchai ke kram main isa messiah ke baarah prerit chelon, mariyam, isa messiah kii maan, chaar nai tastomant ke lekhak or sarvocch sthaan par swayan isa messiah ke pratik honge
 As of 2010, eight spiers have been built, dedicated to the authors of four New Testament and four saints who appear in the birth of Christ
 pariyojna kii aadhikarik website ke 2005 'nirmaan' report' ke anusaar, gaudi dwaara hastakshar kiye gaye chitra se pataa chalata he ki marayam ko samarpit spayer gaudi ke anusaar nai tastomant ke lekhakon se chota hona chahie tha
 These pictures have recently been found in the city archives
 spaayeron kii oonchaai maujuuda neenv ke saath gaudi ke iraadon ke anukool banaai jaaegi
 Its assurance was given in the 'construction' report '
 nai tastomant ke lekhakon ke spayer unke paramparaagat pratikon kii murtiyon dwaara qad main badhaayaa jayega jaise ek bail saint luk kaa pratik he, ek pankhons vaala aadmi mathew kaa pratik he, ek baaj jon kaa pratik he, or ek sher mark kaa pratik he
 The central spire of Yasu Christ will be elevated by a huge cross; Due to all this the total height of the spaer will be reduced by one meter as compared to 170
 yah barsilona kii montuik pahari se qad main kam he kyonki gaudi nahin chaahate}} the ki unki banaai imaarat bhagwaan kii oonchaai se muqaabala kare
 Sagrada Familia will become the largest church in the world after the completion of these spiers
 1894 or 1930 ke bich nirmit, isa messiah ke janm kaa pratik sthaal is girjaghar main puraa hone hone vaala pehla pratik sthaal tha
 It is dedicated to the birth of Jesus Christ
 yahan unke jivan ke vibhinn tatwon kii yaad tazaa karne ke liye drishyon ke saath sajaayaa he
 The characteristic of Gaudi's natural style is that the sculptures are each decorated with a symbol in its own way
 udhaaharan ke liye, teen chat do bade stambhon se alag ho rahe hai, or prayek ke aadhaar par ek chota kachua yaa ek bada kachua he 
 Unlike the turtles and their symbols, two chameleon symbols are also found that symbolize change
 yah pratik sthal uttar-purv kii ore ugte suraj kii raushnee jhelta he, jo ki messiah ke janm kaa chinh samajha jaataa he
 It represents three religious virtues, each of which is divided through a roof
 jivan kaa ped daan kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale isa messiah ke darvaaze ke upar se aage kii ore bad jaataa he
 Four towers complete this emblem and each of them is variously dedicated to the names of Saint Matthias, St
 Barnabas, Jude, and Simon Canaanites
 mul rup se gaudi ne iraadaa kiya tha ki yah pratik sthal bahurangi ho or har maharaab ko rangon kii ek vistrut sarani ke saath chitrit kiya jaae
 He wanted to give every idol and color
 isi kaaran se insaanon ke pratimaaen or bhi kahin zyada jivit lagati hai jaise ki paudhe or pashuon kii pratimaaon main mahasoos kiya jaataa he
 Gaudí has chosen this symbol site to represent the structure and decoration of the entire church
 vah is baat se bhalee-bhaanti parichit the ki vah girjaghar ko apane jeevankaal main kabhi puraa nahin kar paayenge
 But others felt the need to set an artistic and architectural example to adopt in their work
 unhen vishwaas tha ki yadi ve isa messiah ke janm sthal se purv sneh ke pratik kaa nirmaan shuru karte hai to vah sakht or niras lagegaa or log ise dekhte hi munh mode lenge
 Also some idols were destroyed in 1936
 or un phir se nirmaan murtikar sotu ke saathon hua tha
 Unlike the heavily decorated Christ's birthplace, the site of affection is plain and simple in penance, with stone sufficiently carved here, with rigid straight lines to resemble the bones of a skeleton
 yah sthal un yaatnaaon ko samarpit he jinhen isa messiah ne unke suuli par chadaaye jane ke dauraan isa messiah ne dukh ke rup main jhele the
 This symbol site was also created with the intention of portraying the sins of man
 iskaa nirmaan 1954 main shuru hua tha jo gaudi dwaara utaare gaye chitron par aadhaarit tha
 These towers were completed in 1976
 1987 main jojeff maaria subirachs ke netritv main vibhinn drishy banane shuru kiye
 The largest and most startling construction of the symbol sites, it may be the symbol of the magnification that started construction in 2002
 yah sthal isa messiah kii aasamaani badai par samarpit he or yah ishwar tak ke maarg ko dikhaata he: maut, antim nirnay, or badai
 Whereas Hell on the left is for those who turn away from the path of God
 yah jaanate hue ki nirmaan kii samaapti vah jivit nahin rahegaa, gaudi ne ek namoona tayyar kiya tha jise 1936 main dhwast kar diya gaya tha
 Some of the original excerpts were used in the development of this symbol site project
 is pratik sthal ke nirmaan ke liye girjaghar ke ek bhaag ko puri tarah se todna pad saktaa he
 Death and answering to God will also be shown in this symbol site
 girjaghar ke andar ke bhaag ke kollam ek adwitiya gaudi aakaar dikhaate hai
 In addition to branches to support their load, there are consequences of their ever changing surfaces and the intersection of various geometric forms
 stambh ek daayre jaisaa he jo antat bad jaataa he or solah-tarfaa rup rakhata he
 The simplest example of this is of a square base developed in an octagon

 Yamuna is a river in India
 yah ganga nadi kii sabase badi sahaayak nadi he jo yamunotri naamak jagah se nikalati he or prayag main ganga se mil jaati he
 Its major tributaries are Chambal, Sengar, Chhoti Sindh, Batwa and Cane
 yamuna ke tatavarti nagaron main dilli or agra ke atirikt itawa, kalpi, hamirpur or prayag mukhya he
 Yamuna in Prayag presents as a huge river and merges into the Ganges under the famous historical fort there
 braj kii samskruti main yamuna kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 It originates from a place called Yamunotri
 yah ganga nadi kii sabase badi sahaayak nadi he
 The origin of the Yamuna is the Kalind Mountains, located 7 to 8 miles northwest of the snow-capped monkey range of the Himalayas, 6200 meters in height, after which the Yamuna is called Kalindja or Kalindi
 apane udgam se aage kai mile tak vishaal himagaaron or him mandit kandaraon main aprakat rup se bahati hui tathaa pahari dhalaanon par se atyant tivrathapurvak utarati hui isaki dhara yamunottaree parvat se prakat hoti he
 Thousands of pilgrims arrive from every corner of India every year for its visit
 yamunottaree parvat se nikalakar yah nadi anek pahari daron or ghaatiyon main pravaahit hoti hui tathaa vadier, kamalad, vadari aslor jaisi choti or tons jaisi badi pahari nadiyon ko apane anchal main sametati hui aage badhati he
 After that it leaves the Himalayas and enters the valley of Doon
 vahaan se kai mile tak dakshin-pashchim kii or bahati hui tathaa giri, sirmaur or aashaa naamak choti nadiyon ko apni god main leti hui yah apane udgam se lagbhag 95 mile dur vartmaan saharanpur jila ke faijabad gram ke sameep maidan main aati he
 At that time, the height up to its coast remains about 1276 feet above sea level
 bhuvanbhaskar surya iske pita, mrityu ke devtaa yama iske bhai or bhagwaan shri krishna iske pati sweekaarya kiye gayi hai
 Where Lord Shri Krishna is called the father of Braj culture, Yamuna is considered its mother

 Hence it is called Yamuna Maiya in Braj

 Shri Rupa Goswami, a Gaudiya scholar, has described Yamuna as a true Chidanandamayi

 After reaching the western Saharanpur, after traveling from the Western Himalayas, traveling 95 miles along the border of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana
 phir yah dilli, agra se hoti hui elahabaad main ganga nadi main mil jaati he
 Yamuna river has an average depth of 10 feet and maximum depth of 35 feet
 dilli ke nikat nadi main, yah adhiktam gaharaai 68 feet he
 In Agra, these depths are up to 3 feet
 maidan main jahaan is samay yamuna kaa pravaah he, vahaan vah sadaa se pravaahit nahin hoti rahi he
 It is known from mythological observations and historical references, although the Yamuna has been in existence for thousands of years, its flow has changed from time to time
 apane sudhirdh jivan kaal main isane jitne sthaan badale hai, unamem se bahut kam kii hi jaankaree praapt ho saki he
 In prehistoric times, the Yamuna flowed near Madhuban, where Shatradhan Ji first established the city of Mathura on its banks
 valmiki ramayana or vishnu puraana main iskaa vivaran praapt hota he
 1 During the Krishna period, the flow of Yamuna was close to Katra Keshava Dev
 satrahavin shatabadi main bharat aane vaale europea vidwaan tevernear ne katra ke sameep kii bhoomi ko dekh kar yah anumaan laga liya tha ki vahaan kisi samay yamuna kii dhara thi
 In this context, Grouse is of the opinion that the Yamuna is less likely to flow near Katra in the historical period, but Yamuna was definitely there in very ancient times
 2 isse bhi yah siddh hota he ki krishna kaal main yamuna kaa pravaah katra ke sameep hi tha
 Kannidham estimates, in the time of the Yannani writers, that the main stream of Yamuna or a large branch of it would flow under the eastern wall of Katra Keshav Dev
 3 jav mathura main buddha dharm kaa vyapak prachaar go gaya or yahan yamuna ke donon ore anek sandhaaram banaaye gayi, tav yamuna kii mukhya dhara katra se hatakar praayah usee sthaan par bahati hogi, jahaan vah ab he, kintu uski koi shakha athwa sahaayak nahin katra ke nikat bhi vidhman thi
 It is estimated that that branch of the Yamuna flowed under the Keshav Dev Temple until much later than the Buddhist period, possibly until the sixteenth century
 pehle do barsaati nadiyaan 'saraswati' or 'krishna ganga' mathura ke pashchimi bhaag main pravaahit hokar yamuna main girti thim, jinaki smriti main yamuna ke saraswati sangam or krishna ganga naamak ghat hai
 It is possible that only one of those tributaries of Yamuna flows near Katra
 vallabh sampradaay ke vaarta sahitya se gyaat hota he ki saraswat kalp main yamuna nadi jamunaavati gram ke sameep bahati thi
 At that time, there were two streams of Yamuna river, one stream used to flow near Nandgaon, Varsana, Sanket, on Jamunavati in Govardhan and the other stream went towards Gokul via Pirghat
 aage daanon dharaayen ek hokar vartmaan agra kii ore bad jaati thi
 Evidence of flow of Yamuna in Parasauli Meets till 1717

 At present, on coming to the plain near the village of Faizabad in Saharanpur district, it further separates the districts of Ambala and Karnal in Haryana from Saharanpur and Muzaffarnagar districts of Uttar Pradesh, rising for 65 miles
 is bhu-bhaag main isamen muskarra, kath, hindon or sabi naamak nadiyaan milti hai, jinke kaaran iskaa aakaar bahut bad jaataa he
 The Eastern Yamuna Canal and the Western Canal are drawn from it as soon as they come into the field
 ye donon naharen yamuna se pani lekar is bhu-bhaag kii saikadon mile dharti ko haraa-bharaa or upaj sampann bana detii hai
 This land has boundaries of several small big cities of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh on either side of the Yamuna stream, but the oldest and first city situated on its right bank is Delhi, which has been the capital of India for a long time

 unke duusare or vyavsaayik rup se sabase safal sadsy mandali main ian gilaan, ritchi blackmor, jone lord, roger glover or ian pes shaamil the
 The troupe lasted from 1969 to 1973 and was revived from 1984 to 1989, and again in 1993, before the ever-widening gap between Blackmore and other members was created
 vartmaan sadsy mandali main guitar vadak steve morse kaaphi lambey samay tak rahe, haalanki 2002 main lord ke seva nivrutt hone ke baad pes ne band kii mul sadsyta kabhi nahin chodi
 In 1967, former explorer drum player Chris Curtis contacted London businessman Tony Edwards, hoping that he would manage a group he was building called a roundabout: he was called because the member was a musical roundabout Used to join the band and leave it
 yojana se prabhavit hokar, edwards ne do vyavsaayik bhagidaar: jon choleta or ron hair ) ke saath is udhyam ko vittposhit karne par sahmati vyakti kii
 The first was recruited by the classically trained Hammond organist, John Lord, who played guitar alongside (especially the first one to feature The Artwoods)
 They were followed by session guitarist Ritchie Blackmore who was persuaded to return from Hamburg to audition for the new group
 curtis ko jaldi hi baahar kar diya gaya lekin hek enterprize or saath hi saath lord evam blackmor apana kaary jari rakhane ke utsuk the
 For the bass guitar, Lord suggested the name of his friend Nick Simper, with whom he performed in the band in 1967, called The Flower Pot Men and Their Garden
 simpalar kaa prasiddhi ke liye daawa isliye tha kyonki vah johny kid and da pyrets main the or us car durghatana main kid ke saath the jisamen unki maut ho gai
 He was also with Blackmore in Screaming Lord Sutch's The Savages in which he worked with Blackmore
 is mandali ko da mez ke gayak rod ivance or drum vadak ian pes ne puraa kiya
 After a short tour of Denmark in the spring of 1968, Blackmore suggested a new name: Deep Purple, which was his grandmother's favorite song
 oktober 1968 main, samooh ko jo south kii "hash" ke sahyog se safalataa praapt hui thi, jise america billboard chart par chauthaa or canadian RPM chart par doosraa sthaan mila
 is geet ko unke pratham album shades of deep purple se liya gaya tha or kriim ko unke gudby daure par samarthan pradaan karne ke liye inkaa naam darj kar liya gaya
 The band's second album, The Book of Telesin, was published on the same tour in the US, ranking 38th on Billboard and 21st on the RPM chart, although it was not published in their native country until the following year
 1969 main unhone apni teesri album "deep purple " ko jari kiya jisamen ek trek par strings or woodwind shaamil tha
 Many of the most effective evidences of this, especially Vanilla Fudge and Lord's classical pre-history such as Bach and rimsky-korsakov, were
 in teen albamon or america main bahut adhik daure karne ke baad, unki america record company, tetragrameton ko vyavsaay main kaaphi ghaataa hua jisase band ke paas koi dhan nahin bachaa or unka bhavishya anishchit ho gaya
 Who published Deep Purple records throughout the United States in the 1970s
) Returning to England in early 1969, he recorded a single titled "amereta", named after Emeretta Marks, actor member of the musical Hair That Evans Trying to lure, Evans and Simpler were expelled from there
 gayak ke sthaan ko bharne kii khoj main, blackmor ne apane anubhav ke aadhaar par 19 varshiya gayak terry read ko lagaaya jisane navnirmit lead zeplin ke avasar ko thukraa diya tha
 Although he was given a chance at "flattering", Reid was still restricted to an exclusive contract with his producer Mickey Most and had a strong interest in pursuing a solo career
 blackmor ke paas kahin or dekhne ke alaava koi vikalp nahin tha
 The band took on singer Ian Gillan from Episode Six who published several albums one by one without achieving much commercial success in the UK
 Six's drummer Mick underwood-blackmore's childhood classmate introduced and bossed] isane deep purple ko mahatvapurn sthiti kii duusari shrenee main laakar khadaa kar diya jiske pehle greenve-cook tun jiskaa naam "halaluja" kaa prakaashan amangalakaari rahaa jo flop ho gayi
 The band received more than expected by the Concerto for Group and Orchesta, a three-movement epic composed as a solo project and staged by the band at the Royal Albert Hall, the Royal Philharmonic Orchesta conducted by Malcolm Arnold
 With Five Bridges by The Nice, although it was the first collaboration between a rock band and an orchesta, some people from Deep Purple were not overjoyed at it from time to time because it had a question mark on "a group of orchestras" Worked Together "seemed to have made the band stand out even more tight, horde rocking style
 Despite this, Lord wrote that the band recorded Gemini Sweet in the late 1970s in collaboration with another orchesta / group involved in the same work
 arcestra prakashit hone ke turant baad band ne bahut hi vyast daura or recording shuru ho gayi jisane agle teen varshon ke liye kuch raahat pahunchaayi
 is samay ke unke sabase pehali studio album ko 1970 dashak ke madhya main jari kiya gaya jise in rock ko 1971 kii garmiyon main release kiya gaya
 Like "strange Kind of Woman" the title track "fireball" was released not only from the album but as a single recorded during the same seasons
 firebal ke release hone ke kuch saptaah ke bheetar hi band agle album ke liye yojanabaddh gaanon pradarshan karne lage
 ek gane ko firebal tour ke pehle gig main prastut kiya gaya jise portsmouth main ek kaarykram ke liye bas par likhaa ja rahaa tha jise ek patrkaar ke sawaal ke jawaab main likhaa gaya tha, vah sawaal tha: "aap gaanon kaa lekhan kaise karte hai?" teen maheene baad, disambar 1971 main band ne mashin head kii recording ke liye switzaraland kii yatra kii
 album ko rolling stones mobile studio kaa upyog karke montrex ke ek casino main record kiya janaa tha lekin frank jappa or madars of invension ke ek gig ke dauraan lagi aag ne casino ko jalaakar raakh kar diya
 album kii recording vastav main paas ke khaali grand hotel main kii gai
 The incident famously inspired the song "smoke on the Water"
 gilaan kaa maananaa he ki unhone madars ke mark volman par tippanee: "arthur brown in person!" karne kaa prayaas karte hue sangeet kaarykram ke dauraan diwaar kii chat par ek aadmi ko ek flair gan chalaate hue dekha tha
 Continuing from where both previous albums were abandoned, Machine Head has since become one of the band's best-known albums, including tracks that feature live classics, such as "highway Star", " Space Trucking "," Lazy "and" Smoke on the Water "became, Deep Purple being the most famous song
 deep purple ne ek aisi raftaar se daure or recording ko jari rakhaa jo tees saalon main durlabh hota: jab mashin head kii recording hui thi, samooh sirf saadhe teen se hi saath the, phir bhi yah unka saatvaan LP tha

 On 4 August 2008, Zuma appeared in court
 On 12 September 2008, Pietermaritzburg Judge Chris Nicholson stated that the corruption charges against Zuma were illegal on procedural grounds because the National Directorate of Public Prosecutions did not give Zuma the opportunity to submit a representation before deciding to press charges and pay the state legal
 Instructed to do
 nikholson ne yah bhi kaha ki, unka maananaa tha ki raajnneetik hastkshep ne zuma ke khilaaf punah aarope daayar karne ke nirnay main ek bhoomika nibhaai, yadhyapi unhone yah nahin bataaya ki kyon unhone zuma par lage aaropon ko avaidh bataaya
 Nikholson also emphasized that his decision was not related to Zuma's guilt or guilt, but was only on a procedural basis
 vibhinn media reporton ne yah galat soochna di ki zuma ke khilaaf aarope khaarij kar die gaye hai
 This was not the case
 NDPP, zuma par punah aarope lagane main sakasham bana hua tha, haalanki, sirf ek hi baar unhen NDPP ke samaksh abhyavedan prastut karne kaa mauka diya gaya wo bhi NDPP ke aisa karne ke nirnay ke aadhaar par
 nirnay ke 47 paragraph main, nyaayadhish nikholson ne likhaa, The compulsion to listen to representations is a part of the principle of audi alteram partem
 aavashyaktaa yah he ki ek vyakti jo ho saktaa he ki ek nirnay ke kaaran pratikul rup se prabhavit ho rahaa he, use ek anukool parinaam praapt karne kii drushti se ek abhyavedan prastut karne kaa avasar diya janaa chahie

 The court determined that the ndpp's failure to follow the procedure outlined in section 179 of the constitution invalidated the ndpp's decision to re-charge Zuma
 nyaayadhish nikholson ne paaya ki zuma par lagaae gaye aaropon ke samay par vibhinn anumaan lagaae ja sakate hai jo is nishkarsh kii pushti karata he ki isamen sarkaar kii kaaryakari shakha dwaara raajnneetik hastkshep kaa kuch ansh shaamil he
 Judge Nicholson writes in paragraph 210 of his decision, raashtrapati kii polokavane main hui raajnneetik haar ke baad, 28 disambar 2007 ko shriman emse dwaara chalaae gaye abhiyog kaa samay, sabase adhik durbhagyapurna tha
 This aspect, combined with the incident of Mr
 Piccoli who should have been independent and immune to the suspension of executive intervention, convinced me that the most true conclusion is that the damaging political influence continues
 nirnay ke anuchhed 220 main nyaayadhish nikholson ne aage likhaa he, There is a worrying structure in the behaviors i have set out above signs of political interference, pressure or influence
 yah mantri maduna dwaara shri ngakuka ko die gaye "raajnneetik netritv" se shuru hua, jab unhone aavedak par mukadmaa chalaane se inkaar kar diya, jiskaa aparaadh tha unka thint pratinidhiyon se vaarta karnaa or milanaa or anya maamle jiskaa ullekh main kar chukaa hum
 sakshya ke niyam die jane ke kaaran adaalat is nishkarsh ko sweekaar karne ke liye baadhya he jo us paksh ke hit ke liye sabase kam anukool he jinke paas tathyon kaa vishesh gyaan he
 This is certainly more prevalent than the political interference of "clues or suggestions" mentioned in the Yengeni case
 yah ek gambhir chintaa kaa vishay he ki is tarah kii prakriya, nae dakshin africa main ghatit hui or isane rangabhed shashan ke antargat vinaash ko prerit kiya

 NDPP ne jald hi is nirnay ke khilaaf apil karne ke apane iraade kii ghoshnaa kii
 Thabo Mbeki filed an affidavit in the Constitutional Court to appeal the decision of Pietermaritzburg High Court Judge Chris Nicholson: mujhase sambandhit aise doorgaami "afasosjanak, pariwadaatmak or pratikul" nishkarsh nikalnaa or zuma maamle ke un nishkarshon ke aadhaar par faisla karnaa or ninda karnaa adaalat ke liye anuchit tha
 My absolute request is that the defense of the interests of justice is in improving the matter
 in pratikul nishkarshon ne mere ANC party dwaara meraa naam waapas liye jane ko falit kiya - yah ek aisa nivedan tha jise maine pichley 52 varshon se ANC kaa ek patibaddh or vafaadaar sadsy ke rup main sweekaar kiya

 doosraa pahalu yah tha ki kya nyaayadhish nikholson zuma par ilzaam lagaae jane ke NPA ke nirnay ke sandarbh main tatkaaleen raashtrapati thabo mabek dwaara die gaye raajnneetik dakhal ko samajhane main sahi the
 On the question of inviting representations during the review of the npa's decision, Harms DP found that the interpretation of section 179 of the Constitution given by Nicholson was incorrect because the NPA had no such obligation and was therefore free to accuse Zuma, He has done
 nikholson ke mabek dwaara die gaye raajnneetik dakhal ke vishay main die gaye tark ke sawaal par, harms deepi ne paaya ki "nichali adaalat ne apane adhikaron kaa ulanghan kiya he"
