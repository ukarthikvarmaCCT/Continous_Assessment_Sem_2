 Acid is a chemical compound which dissolves in water to give hydrogen ions
 iskaa ph maan 7
0 se kam hota he
 According to the modern definition given by Johannes Nicholas Bronstedt and Martin Laurie, acid is the chemical compound that provides hydrogen ions to the repulsive compound
 jaise- asitic amla or salphurik amla 
 amla, thos, drav yaa gas, kisi bhi bhautik avasthaa main paae ja sakate hai
 They can live in pure form or in slurry form
 jis padaarth yaa yogic main amla ke gun paae jate hai ve kehalaate hai
 Acidity or acidity is a disease caused by excess of hydrochloric acid in the human bowel
 amla un padaarthon ko kehete hai jo pani main ghulne par khattey swaad ke hote hai, haldi se bani roli ko pilaa kar dete hai,tathaa inkaa jaleey vilyan nile litmus paper ko laal karata he
 Most metals react with hydrogen to produce gas, and neutralize the base
 mote hisaab se ksharak un padaarthon ko kehete hai jinka vilyan chikna-chikna sa lagata he, swaad kadva hota he, haldi ko laal kar dete hai or amlon ko udasin karte hai
 To neutralize means to make a substance which has neither the properties of acid nor of base
 lavaazie ne oxygen ke gunon kaa adhyayan karte samay dekha ki carbon, gandhak or phosphorus sadrush tatv jab oxygen main jalte hai tab unase bane oxide jal ke saath milakar amla banaate hai
 They reached the result that there is oxygen in acids and oxygen is the cause of acidic acid
 isi kaaran is gas kaa naam "oxygen" padaa, jiskaa arth hota he "amla banaanevaala padaarth" tathaa isi kaaran german bhashaa main oxygen ko "sir staf" arthath amla padaarth kehete hai
 Lavaziye divided acids into two classes, inorganic acids and organic acids
 peeche dekha gaya ki kuch tatwon ke oxide pani main ghulkar amla nahin balki kshar banaate hai or kuch amlon main oxygen bilkul nahin hota
 Bertile invented hydrocyanic acid in 1787, Davy invented hydrochloric acid in 1810–11 and hydriodic acid in 1813
 inamen se kisi main oxygen nahin he
 It has been observed later that the substances which are completely dry do not have any acidic reaction
 tab logon ne amlon ko do virgon main vibhakt kiya, ek hydro-amla or doosraa oxy-amla
 Back in 1815, Dewey suggested that the acidicity of acids is not due to oxygen, but due to hydrogen
 duulang ne san 1815 main oxylik amla kaa adhyayan kiya or is parinaam par pahunche ki oxynwaale or bina oxynwaale amlon main koi bhed nahin he
 Acids do not have any properties that we can call specific characteristics of acids
 saadhaaran gun upar bataae ja chuke hai
 In acid and metal reactions, one, or more, hydrogen atoms of an acid molecule are displaced by metals, metal oxides, hydroxides or carbonates
 aise bhi kuch amla hai jo khattey hone ke badale mithe hote hai
 One such acid is amido-phosphoric acid
 kuch aise bhi amla hai jo ksharhar nahin hote
 There are also some alkalis whose hydrogen is displaced by metals
 fitkaree amla nahin he
 There is also no hydrogen to be displaced
 par yah swaad main khatta or kriya main ksharhar hota he
 It also turns blue litmus to red
 isi prakaar sodium baislphide khatta or ksharhar hota he
 It turns blue litmus red
 isamen visthapit honevaala hydrogen bhi he, par yah amla nahin he
 Methane is not an acid, but its hydrogen is displaced by zinc and thus zinc is dimethyl which is not a salt
 at: amla kii koi santoshprad paribhaasha ab tak nahin di ja saki he
 If we want to define acids on the basis of ion theory, then we can say that hydrogen ions are essential in acids
 silavian ne san 1659 main pehle pahal amlon or ksharakon main vibhed kiya tha
 In 1774, Rul gave the name base, which combines with acids to form salts
 aajkal ksharak un oxygen vaale padaarthon ko kehete hai jo amlon ke poorak hote hai
 Alkali metals, alkali metals and other metal oxides and all those things are alkalis which combine with acids to form salts
 aarambh main ksharak keval un dhaatuon athwa dhaatuon ke oxidon ke liye vyavahrat hota tha jo lavenon ke "base" yaa aadhaar the
 The bases of salts are essential components
 ksharak vastav main ve padaarth hai jo amla ke saath milakar lavan or jal banaate hai
 For example, zinc oxide combines with sulfuric acid to form zinc sulfate and water
 daahak soda salfurik amla ke saath milakar sodium sulphate or jal banaata he
 Oxides of metals are generally base
 par iske apwaad bhi hai
 The bases contain metal oxides and hydroxides, but for convenience some groups of elements are also formed which combine with acids to form salts without water
 aise ksharakon main ammonia, hydraxylemin or phosphin hai
 Fluid dissolves ammonia but gives no color with phenolphthalein
 at: kahan tak yah ksharak kaha ja saktaa he, yah baat sandigdh he
 Although the definition of the base above is very unsatisfactory, it has not given a good definition
 ksharak or kshar paryaayavachi jaabd nahin hai
 All bases are bases but not all bases are bases
 kshar-dhaatuon ke oxide, jaise sodium oxide, jal main ghulkar hydraksaide banaate hai
 They are strongly basic
 kshareey mrudadhatuon ke oxide, jaise kellisyam oxide, jal main alp viley or alp kshareey hote hai
 Oxides of other metals do not dissolve in water and their hydroxides are made indirectly
 dhaatuon ke oxide or hydraksaide ksharak hote hai
 Alkali metal oxides dissolve quickly in water
 kuch dhaatuon ke oxide jal main kam viley hote hai or kuch dhaatuon ke oxide jal main tanik bhi viley nahin hai
 Some nonmetal hydrides, such as hydrides of nitrogen and phosphorus are also consumed

 Matthew Williams, his wife, Jennifer, and his ailing mother, Emma arrive at Seiki House
 jenifer japan main apane jivan se naakhush he, vah bhashaa bolne main asamarth he or ek baar ghoomane ke dauraan kho chuki he
 Matthew assures her that the environment will improve and if it doesn't, the family will return to the United States
 jenifer living room main ek sofe par so jaati he
 The sound of a bowl hitting the ground opens her sleep and she finds that the bowl is lying on the ground and its contents are scattered everywhere
 wo gandagi failaane ke liye emma ko daantati he, lekin phir haul se baahar jate hue bhiige hue bachche ke pad chihn dekhati he
 She sees a cat at the end of the stairs and sees a pair of white arms raising it comfortably
 vah upar jaati he or apane shayankaksh main pravesh karti he 
 uske peeche daravaaza band ho jaataa he
 Matthew returns from work and finds that clutter is spread throughout the house with scattered garbage
 vah apni patni ko awaz detaa he, jo uttar nahin detii he
 Eventually he finds her on her bed, unable to move or speak and is struggling to breathe
 isse pehle ki vah ek ambulance bula sake, toshiyo naam kaa jawan ladkaa achaanak upasthit ho kar billi kii awaz nikaal kar use chaunkaa detaa he
 He hits the wall as Toshio suddenly appears in front of him

 After a persistent effort to make the call, Susan becomes worried over not being able to reach Matthew
 vah apane karyaalay kii imaarat se baahar nikalne kii taiyaari karti he lekin galiyare se karaahne kii awaz use roak detii he
 She quickly moves towards the stairs but is afraid of the flicker and glow of the light
 sujan railing ke upar se dekhati he ki kayako kaa bhoot sidhiyon par reng rahaa he
 Susan quickly moves towards the nearest corridor but Kayako grabs her cell phone pendant and pulls it out
 sujan madad ke liye suraksha karyaalay main jaati he
 The security guard there assures to investigate it
 guard dwaara jaanch ke dauraan sujan monitor ko dekhati he
 However, he finds nothing and is gone

 Susan runs away
 sujan apane apartment main vaapis jane ke liye ek taxi cab leti he

 sujan is par dhyaan nahin detii, haalanki toshiyo prayek darvaaze ke baahar khadaa hota he or har manzil ke guzarane ke saath uttarottar kareeb hota jaataa he
 Susan comes in safely when her phone rings

 She tells him her address and activates Bazar with the phone
 uske phone rakhane ke turant baad darvaaze kii ghanti bajati he
 Thinking that Matthew might not have arrived yet, she looks through the door hole
 mathew ko dekh kar use jhatka lagata he, sujan sochati he ki vah uske saath khel khel rahaa he
 She angrily opens the door, but there is no one there
 maut kii aahat sujan ke haath main pakade hue phone ke madhyam se tej hoti jaati he
 She drops the phone and breaks, yet the sound can be heard
 sujan dar kar bistar main chadar ke neeche chup jaati he or apane phone se khargosh ke paanv vaali latakan nikaalati he or dar ke maare use phenk detii he
 a body emerges from the underside of the sheet and moves towards Susan
 vah chadar uthaati he or kayako kaa cheharaa dekhati he
 He is suddenly pulled in and the two completely disappear
 yoko ek ladki he jiskaa kaam emma kii dekhbhaal karnaa or ghar ko saafe rakhana he
 While picking up the trash on the floor and stairs, he gets the sound of someone walking from the terrace room
 awaz kaa peechha karte hue, yoko shayan kaksh main pravesh karti he or ek kothri kii chat main ek chote se daravaaje ko dekhati he, jo ataari kii ore jaataa he
 Using a lighter, Yoko peeks through the door in search of the source of the voice and looks around slowly
 antat use kayako seki onryo ke rup main dikhti he, jo us par hamalaa karti he or use ghaseet kar kothri main le jaati he
 After Yoko's disappearance, Karen Davis is then called to work at home and care for Emma
 kaam karte vakt, karren ko ek kothri kaa pataa chalata he jise tepe se band kiya gaya he tathaa jisame se billi jaisi awaajen aa rahi hai
 When she removes the tape and opens the door, she finds a small boy
 ladkaa neeche aane se manaa kar detaa he to vah uskaa naam puuchhati he
 "toshio", he says in a cold, terrible voice
 emma ko jhurajuri shuru hoti he or use duusare kamare se budbudane kii awaajen aati hai
 While Karen calms her down, a thick shade of hair appears from the corner of the room scaring Emma
 karren dekhati he ki kayako emma ke paas pahunch rahi he
 Kayako's hair, which covered her face, retracts, showing the awfulness of her eyes
 tahaniyaan simtane lagati hai or karren kii ore dekhati he jo ki dar ke maare peeche hatane lagati he
 Eventually, Karen's boss Alex arrives and finds Emma unconscious and Karen in shock
 karren ko aspataal le jaaya jaataa he jabaki jasoos elex se sawaal poochhate hai
 Detective Nakagawa asks Alex about the people living there and tells him that Yoko has gone missing from her job
 jasoos paata he ki phone kaa hand set credele main nahin he or vah pej batan ko dabaata he
 They search for sounds coming from the attic where they find the corpses of Matthew and his wife
 ve ek maanav jabade kii bhi daraavnee khoj karte hai or aashcharya vyakt karte hai ki yah kisase sambandhit he or baaki kaa sharir kahan ho saktaa he
 Later in the film, Alex sees Yoko again while she is walking down the stairs of the care office, where Alex, Karen, and Yoko work
 jaise hi vah uski ore badhata he, durghatanavash vah ek taral ke upar phisal jaataa he jise chune par use pataa lagata he ki yah khun he
 Alex voices Yoko again and again, who does not answer until she reaches the bottom of the stairs
 Then as soon as she turns to see her face, Alex screams and dies in fear, her face is shown to be horribly deformed without a jaw, with the tongue hanging out, and then the screen slowly
 Slowly it turns black
 karren ladke kii upasthiti par bal dete hue jasuson ko apni kahani bataati he
 Over the next few days, she is constantly tortured by Kayako, during her shower, in a bus, etc
 bhaybheet kintu drudh nishchay karke vah ghar ke itihaas kii khoj shuru karti he, aakhirkaar, use hatyaon kaa kaaran pataa chal jaataa he
 Detective Nakagawa is convinced that the continued deaths and missing people are related to the house when he watches the full security video taken at Susan's office building
 vah kayako ko haal main aate hue dekhtaa he, phir uske baad camere ke saamne aate hue jiske baad video khatm ho jaataa he
 He then arrives at Seki House with two cans of petrol
 vah bath tub main dub rahe toshiyo kii awaz se se vichlit ho jaataa he
 He enters and sees a boy hanging out of the tub and tries to revive him
 uski ankhen khuli rah jaati hai or taakeo uske peeche prakat hota he
 Nakagawa only turns around before Takeo pushes him into the bathtub and kills him like Toshio
 karren peter kii vidhwaa, maaria kark se sawaal puuchhati he jise ghar, isamen rahane waalon or apane pati kii aatmahatya ke vishay main kuch bhi pataa nahin hota
 She allows Karen to search through old photographs

 Karen is followed by her boyfriend Doug
 karren flash back main dekhati he ki peter ghar main unke sharir khoj rahaa he
 Fearing the cruelty of Kayako's murder by Takeo, Karen descends the stairs and reaches home in the present moment
 uske jane se pehle dag uske takhne pakad letaa he
 She is incapacitated and tries to pull him towards the door
 upar ek darwaja khulata he
 Onyo as Kayako comes down the stairs crawling and kisses Dug to death
 karren daravaaza kholti he, lekin achaanak vahaan kayako kaa bhoot aa jaataa he
 She slams the door and kicks one of the gas coaches
 vah dag kaa liter leti he or use achaanak gas par oochaal detii he kyonki dag achaanak kayako ban jaataa he
 The screen turns white
 
 At the hospital, Karen discovers that the house has survived the burn and she mourns Doug's corpse
 achaanak, kayako ke bal or bahen use dhakne vaali chadar ke neeche se nikal aate hai, kintu karren ko ehsaas hota he ki yah uski kalpana maatr he 
 iske baad kayako karren ke peeche dikhaai detii he
 The film ends with Kayako staring at his eyes while Kayako cries to his death
 tokyo main rahati or kaam karti he, tathaa jo apane bhai, bhabhi or maa kii nae ghar ko chunane tathaa usame sthanantarit hone main sahaayta karti he
 In Real Joo-on: The Grudge, Kayako is not shown on screen by Takio, except for an early scene hint that shows him following her murder
 yah kayako kii ju-on hatya ko ek rahasy bana detaa he
 The bite marks on both his body and face are believed to have killed him with a small knife
 dividi relies main ek hataaya gaya drishy dikhaaya gaya he jisame taakeo kayako par ek chote chaaku se waar karata he
 One possibility is that Kayako sees Takeo reading her diary in her bedroom and he pushes her down and attacks her
 vah sidhiyon se neeche bhaagti he or taakeo uskaa peechha karata he
 Kayako is surrounded by Takeo and joins the wall near the door
 toshiyo sidhiyon ke upar se dekh rahaa he, use samaj nahin aata ki vastav main kya ho rahaa he
 Takeo extends his hand to Kayako's face to bite his throat
 toshiyo chalaa jaataa he or apni kothri main chhip jaataa he
 Takeo brings Kayako to his bedroom and adopts his face with a small knife
 uske baad vah use ek plastic ke thile main lapetata he or use ataari main daalata he
 He kills Toshio and kills his cat
 taakeo billi ke saath toshiyo ko kothri main waapas daal detaa he
 Kayako's body was found in the attic and Takayo died in a nearby street due to Kayako's ghost
 
 haalanki, yah bhi sambhaavna lagati he ki kayako ko chaaku se maarane se pehle uski gardan todi gayi thi, jaise ki uske dwaara apni gardan ko ghumaate samay nikalne vaali awaajon se lagata he
 In the remake, Kayako is killed when Takeo breaks his neck
 theatre cat main narsanhaar ko screen par nahin dikhaaya gaya he, kintu nirdeshak cat main sab kuch dikhaaya gaya he
 In the director's cut, during a flashback at the end of the film, Kayako is shown standing near her bedroom door and realizes that Takio is reading her diary and that Peter is aware of her fascination for Cancer
 uske baad vah uskaa dalan main peechha karata he or use zamin par gira kar uske takhne mode detaa he, saath hi vah chillaata he or deevaaron par thokaren martha he
 Kayako then crawls down the stairs in an attempt to escape, but is grabbed by Takeo who grabs his neck with both hands
 in ghatnaon ko toshiyo dekh letaa he jo uske baad turant taakeo dwaara uski billi ke saath maar diya jaataa he 
 One interesting thing that Joo-on does is that Toshio's corpse is never revealed, concluding that he may have been eaten by his mother, Kayako
 is film main, taakeo dwaara kayako kii hatya pehali hatya he, jo 1 navambar 2001 ko uske bete toshiyo kii hatya ke saath ghatati he
 The Williams family's story takes place several years later in early 2004, and then in October 2004, Karen and Yoko's stories

 Marketing on mobile phones became increasingly popular in the early 2000s with the increasing trend of SMS in Europe and parts of Asia where businesses gathered mobile phone numbers and started sending desired content to them
 pichley kuch varshon main esemes duniya ke kuch bhaagon main vigyaapan kaa ek vaid madhyam ban gaya he
 This is because unlike e-mail on the public internet, carriers that monitor their own networks have set guidelines and best practices for the mobile media industry

 Although it has proved useful in developed regions such as North America, Western Europe, and some other countries, mobile spam messages remain a problem in many other parts of the world, partly due to carriers using a third of their member databases
 Sides have to be sold
 europe or asia main esemes ke jariye mobile marketing upabhokta tak pahunchane ke ek nae madhyam ke rup main teji se vistaar le chukaa he
 SMS had initially received negative media coverage in many parts of Europe due to a redesign of spam as some advertisers started buying lists and sending unwanted content to consumers' phones; However, after the guidelines set by mobile operators, SMS has become the most popular branch of the mobile marketing industry, through which around 100 million advertisement-related smses are sent every month in Europe alone

 Due to the high prices of short codes at $ 500–1000 per month, many small businesses opt for shared use of short codes in order to reduce monthly costs

 Long numbers are available internationally, as well as to enable businesses to have their own number rather than short codes that are usually shared among multiple brands
 iske atirikt lambey number non-premium inbound number hote hai
 a key criterion for provision is that the consumer chooses his or her option in service

 haalanki kuch mobile vigyaapan upabhokta ko ek aavashyak anumati ke bina bheje ja rahe hai jiske kaaran gopneeyata kaa ulanghan ho rahaa he
 It should be understood that no matter how well designed the advertising messages are and how much additional possibilities they provide, if consumers do not believe their privacy will be protected, it will be largely But will disrupt their spread
 yahan tak ki gopneeyata kaa mudda mobile data networkon ke aagaman ke saath or bhi pramukh ho gaya he
 Several important new concerns have emerged which stem primarily from the fact that mobile devices are very personal and always with the user, four major concerns can be identified: mobile spam, personal identification, location
 Information and wireless security
 kyonki europea sangh or sanyukt rajya america main maujuuda doorsanchaar niyam, vishesh rup se avaanchit vanijyik samvaad or spam ke mudde se sambandhit niyam puraane ho gaye hai, inke liye nayaa kaanoon lagu kiya janaa chahie
 nae kanoonon ko or adhik spasht, lacheela or vyapak hona chahie lekin iske baavjood inhen keval unheen muddon par dhyaan dene vaala hona chahie jo atyant aavashyak hai
 This is important because the law should promote competition, encourage investment, cut unnecessary spending, and remove trade barriers
 They should be prepared in a technically neutral manner so as to avoid the need to constantly adopt the legal framework for new features and independence of the parties involved
 The privacy of consumers must be protected and sellers should be easy to understand and follow these rules
 Kaspersen Heinrich WK has proposed that directives in the context of unsolicited commercial communications should be regulated not only on electronic communications but also on paper distribution
 In addition, the lawmaker should cooperate with technical and business experts to create a suitable legal framework
 in niyamon kaa kriyanvayan ek tarksangat tareeke se kiya janaa chahie jisase ki adaalaton dwaara nae niyamon ko bahut adhik gambhirtha ke saath lagu karne se bachaa ja sake kyonki isse ek bahut hi aashajanak udyog kii pragati baadhit hone yaa simit hone kaa jokhim paidaa ho jayega
lekin in niyamon kii bahut adhik dhili vyakhya se upabhokta apane aapako sangrakshit mahasoos nahin kar sakate hai jiske chalate bhi pragati simit ho sakati he
 In other words, if consumer concerns about privacy are not taken into account, the lack of consumer confidence may jeopardize the progress of mobile advertising; This lack of consumer confidence also discouraged the progress of email marketing
 gopneeyata sangrakshan ke lakshya ko kanoon, saamaajik maandand, vyavsaay ke tareekon or takneekee madhyamon sahit kai tarah ke prayaason ko sanyukt rup se amal main laakar hasil kiya janaa chahie

 These four places are - Badrikashram, Shringeri Peeth, Dwarika Peeth and Sharada Peeth
 inhone anek vidharmiyon ko bhi apane dharm main dikshit kiya tha
 They are considered to be incarnations of Shankar
 inhone brahmasutron kii badi hi vishad or rochak vyakhya kii he
 His sermons are based on the uniformity of the soul and the divine, according to which the divine resides at the same time in both physical and non-physical forms

 He wrote commentaries on Ish, Kane, Kath, Saiv, Mundaka, Mandukya, Aitareya, Taittiriya, Brihadaranyaka and Chandogyopanishad

 Charvak, Jains and Buddhists, which arose at the time due to differences in understanding of the Vedas, were divided by the scriptures and established four monasteries like Jyoti, Govardhan, Shringeri and Dwarka at four corners in India

 Shankar Acharya was born in 788 AD in Kerala in a village called Kalpi or 'kashal'
 inke pita kaa naam shivguru or mata kaa naam subhadra tha
 After worshiping Lord Shiva for a long time, Lord Shiva was found to have son, so he named him Shankar
 jab ye teen hi varsh ke the tab inke pita kaa dehanth ho gaya
 He was very talented and talented
 chah varsh kii avasthaa main hi ye prakand pandit ho gaye the or aath varsh kii avasthaa main inhone sanyas grahan kiya tha
 The story of the time of his retirement is very strange
 kehete hai, mata ekmaatr putr ko sanyasi banane kii ajna nahin detii thim
 Then one day caught the foot of a crocodile Shankaracharyaji on the banks of the river, then taking advantage of this time, Shankaracharya said to his mother "mother do not allow me to retire, otherwise the crocodile will eat me", fearing this, the mother immediately asked him to be a monk
 gave ; And surprisingly, the crocodile left Shankaracharyaji's feet as soon as Mata had given permission
 or inhone govind swami se sanyas grahan kiya
 At first he stayed in Kashi for a few days, and then he defeated Mandan Mishra in the spiritual debate in the talwan of Vigilbindu
 inhone samast bharatvarsh main bhraman karke buddha dharm ko mithyaa pramanit kiya tathaa vaidic dharm ko punarujjivit kiya
 Some Buddhists also consider him their enemy, because they defeated the Buddhists many times in scripture and re-established Vedic religion

 Shankaracharya, whom the present historian tells about 788 - 820 AD, was in fact the 38th Acharya Shri Kamnath Shankar Ji of Kamakoti Peeth
 ve 787 se 840 isvisan tak vidyaman the
 He was the son of Chidambaram resident Srivishwaji
 inhone kashmir ke vaakpatibhat ko shastrarth main parajeet kiya or 30 varsh tak math ke acharya pad par rahe
 All Sanatan religions should have knowledge about the original teacher

, the facts related to his life are revealed

 His father Shiva was a Yajurvedi Brahmin of Guru Taittiriya branch
 bhartiya praachya parampara main aadyashankaracharya ko shiv kaa avatar sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 Some miraculous facts of his life come to light, suggesting that Adya Shankaracharya was in fact the incarnation of Shiva

 The Shringeri Shankaracharyapith of the four religious monasteries, Govardhanpeeth in East Jagannathpuri, Shardamath in West Dwarka and Jyotirpeeth in Badrikashram are still reflecting the unity of India

 After completing all the above works, he became Brahmin at the age of 32 years
 arth:- " sanathan samskruti ke purodha sanakaadi maharishiyon kaa praathmik sarg jab uparati ko praapt ho gaya, abhyuday tathaa ni:shreysprad vaidic sanhmaarg kii durgati hone lagi, falswarup swarg durgam hone laga ,apvarg agam ho gaya, tab is bhootal par bhagwaan bharg shankar rup se avateern huai
 " bhagwaan shiv dwaara dwaara kaliyug ke pratham charan main apane chaar shishyon ke saath jagadguru acharya shankar ke rup main avatar lene kaa varnan puranashastra main bhi varnit hai jo is prakaar hai :- Meaning: - After the lapse of two thousand years of Kali, Shri Sarveshwar Shiva, desiring public grace, incarnates as an avatar with his four disciples
 " Meaning: "when the Brahmins in Kali condemn Vedavidya and Vedic deeds; Rudra, the consort, Viktarupa Neelalohit Mahadev incarnates for the prestige of religion
 jo brahmanadi jis kisi upaay se unka aasthaa sahit anusaran seven karte hai ; ve paramgati ko praapt hote hai
 " arth:- " kali main devon ke dev mahadev lokon ke parameshwar rudra shiv manushyon ke uddhaar ke liye un bhakton kii hit kii kaamana se shrout-smart -pratipaadit dharm kii pratishtha ke liye vividh avtaron ko grahan karengen
 They will preach the Vedas performed by the Vedas to the disciples of Brahm Gyan form of salvation religions

 " arth:- "suryasdrush pratapi shri shivavatar acharya shankar shri baadaraayan - vedavyasvirachit brahmasutron par shrutisammat yuktiyukt bhashya sanrachana karte hai
 " shankaracharya ke vishay main kaha gaya he- That is, at the age of eight, he was the master of all the four Vedas, passed all the scriptures at the age of twelve, Shankarbhashyasatha at the age of sixteen and renounced the body at the age of thirty-two
 brahmasutra ke upar shankarabhashyaki rachana kar vishwa ko ek sutara main baandhne kaa prayaas bhi shankaracharya ke dwaara kiya gaya he, jo ki saamaanya maanav se sambhav nahin he
 In Shankaracharya's philosophy, we can see both Saguna Brahma and Nirgun Brahm
 nirgun brahm unka niraakaar ishwar he tathaa sagun brahm saakaar ishwar he
 Jiva is ignorant with the title of person
 tatvamasi tum hi brahm ho; ahan brahmasmi main hi brahm hum; 'ayamatma brahm' yah aatma hi brahm he; in brihadaaranyakopanishad tathaa chaandogopenishad vaakyon ke dwaara is jeevatma ko niraakaar brahm se abhinn sthapit karne kaa praytn shankaracharya ji ne kiya he
 Brahma has been given the reason for the origin, position and destruction of the world
 brahm sat nity, chaitanyaswaroop tathaa anand swaroop he
 They have accepted this
 jeevatma ko bhi sat swaroop, chaitanya swaroop tathaa anand swaroop sweekaar kiya he
 Stating the nature of the world, it is said that - arthath naam evam rup se vyaakrit, anek karta, anek bhokta se sanyukt, jisamen desh, kaal, nimitt or kriyafal bhi niyat hai
 The world whose creation cannot be imagined by the mind, the origin, the position and the rhythm of the world, it is called Brahm
 sampoorn jagat ke jeevon ko brahm ke rup main sweekaar karnaa, tathaa tark aadi ke dwaara uske siddh kar dena, aadi shankaracharya kii visheshta rahi he
 In this way, from the evaluation of Shankaracharya's personality and work, we can say that the task of tying the nation in a sutra was done by Shankaracharya
 bhartiya samskruti ke vistaar main bhi inkaa amuly yogadan rahaa he
 Adi Guru Shankaracharya was born in a village called Kaldi in Kerala
 vah apane brahman mata-pita kii ekmaatr santaan the
 His father died as a child
 shankar kii ruchi armbh se hi sanyas kii taraf thi
 At a young age, after requesting mother to leave for sannyas, he went out in search of Guru
 
 After receiving knowledge from Guru Gobind Paad of Vedanta, he traveled all over the country
 mithila ke pramukh vidwaan mandan mishra ko shastrarth main haraaya
 But Mandan was defeated by Mishra's wife Bharti
 dubaara phir rati vigyaan main paarangat hokar bharti ko parajeet kiya
 He removed the religious evils prevailing in the then India and illuminated the country with the light of Advaita Vedanta
 sanathan dharm kii raksha hetu unhone bharat main chaaron dishaao main chaar mathon kii sthapana kii tathaa shankaracharya pad kii sthapana karke us par apane chaar pramukh shishyon ko asin kiya
 Jyotirmath in the north, Shringeri in the south, Govardhan in the east and Sharda Math in the west established four dhams in the country
 32 saal kii alpaayu main pavitra kedaar nath dham main sharir tyaag diya
 Shankaracharya is known as Adi Guru with respect in the whole country
 ek sanyasi balak, jisaki aayu maatr 7 varsh thi, gurugrih ke niyamanusaar ek brahman ke ghar bhiksha maangane pahunchaa
 There was not even a grain of food in the house of that Brahmin to give alms
 brahman patni ne us balak ke haath par ek aanwala rakhaa or rote hue apni vipannataa kaa varnan kiya
 Seeing his condition, the heart of that love-pity idol child was moved
 vah atyant aart swar main maan lakshmi kaa stotra rachakar us param karunamayi se nirdhan brahman kii vipadaa harne kii prarthana karne laga
 Pleased at his request, Mahalakshmi rained gold amla in the house of that poor poor Brahmin
 jagat janani mahalakshmi ko prasann kar us brahman parivaar kii daridrata dur karne vaala, dakshin ke kaladi gram main janma vah balak tha- ‘'shankar'’, ji aage chalakar '‘jagadguru shankaracharya'’ ke naam se vikhyath hua
 Lord Shankar himself incarnated on this earth in the form of this great scholar Shaktipunj child
 inke pita shivguru nampudri ke yahan vivaah ke kai varshon baad tak jab koi santan nahin hui, tab unhone apni patni vishishtadevi ke saath putr prapti kii kaamana se dirghakaal tak chandramauli bhagwaan shankar kii kathor aradhana kii
 After all, Lord Shankar appeared in a dream and was pleased and said, 'ask for the groom
 ’ shivguru ne apane isht guru se ek dderghaayu sarvajna putr maanga
 Lord Shankar said- 'watts, longevity son will not be omniscient and omniscient son will not have longevity
 bolo tum kaisaa putr chaahate ho?’ tab dharmapraan shastrasevi shivguru ne sarvajna putr kii yachana kii
 Lord Shiva again said - 'watts you will get an omniscient son
 main swayan putr rup main tumhaare yahan avateern hounga
 ' kuch samay ke pashchaat i
 san 686 main baishakh shukla panchami ke din madhyakaal main vishishtadevi ne param prakashrup ati sundar, divya kaantiyukt balak ko janm diya
 Devgn Brahmins reflected the chakra symbol on the forehead of the child, the eye sign on the forehead and the insignia on the wing to represent him as a Shiva avatar and named him 'shankar'
 inhen shankaracharya ji ko prativarsh baishakh shukla panchami ko shradhanjali arpit karne ke liye shri shankaracharya jayanti manaai jaati he
 At the time when Jagadguru Shankaracharya emerged, at that time Vedic religion was melting in Bharata and humanity was dying, in such a situation, Acharya Shankar appeared as Bhaskar Prakash Pillar of human religion
 maatr 32 varsh ke jivan kaal main unhone sanathan dharm ko aisi ojasvi shakti pradaan kii ki uski samast murchha dur ho gai
 Shankaracharya had attained good knowledge of Malayalam at the age of three years
 inke pita chaahate the ki ye sanskrit kaa purna gyaan praapt karen
 But due to the premature death of the father, in the infancy, Shankar's head's shadow rose from Shankar's head and the entire burden fell on Shankar ji's mother's shoulders
 lekin unki mata ne kartavya paalan main kami nahin rakhi
 paanch varsh kii avasthaa main inkaa yagyopavit sanskaar karwaakar vedon kaa adhyayan karne ke liye gurukul bhej diya gaya
 They were rich in talent from the beginning, so their guru was also very surprised by their talent
 apratim pratibha sampann shrutidhar balak shankar ne maatr 2 varsh ke samay main veda, puraana, upanishad, ramayana, mahabharat aadi granth kanthsth kar liye
 After that, after being honored with the Guru, he returned home and started serving Mother
 unki matra shakti itani vilakshan thi ki unki prarthana par alwai nadi, jo unke gaanv se bahut dur bahati thi, apana rukh badal kar kaladi gram ke nikat bahane lagi, jisase unki mata ko nadi snaan main suvidha ho gai
 After some time, his mother thought of his marriage
 par acharya shankar gruhasthi ke jhanjhat se dur rahanaa chaahate the
 An astrologer had also told by looking at the birth chart that at a young age there is the possibility of his death
 aisa jaanakar acharya shankar ke man main sanyas lekar lok-seva kii bhaavana prabal ho gai thi
 He persevered with his mother for retirement and Bal Shankar took retirement at the age of 7
 phir jivan kaa ucchtam lakshya praapt karne ke liye mata se anumati lekar ghar se nikal pade
 One day in the life of Acharya Shankara - Acharya Shankar is versed to reach him in the last moments of Matashree Aryamba's life
 'kaalah krida gachchhatyaayuʼ siddhantanusaar yah kshan udit hota he
 Acharya Shankar gets a foreshadowing from the power of yoga
 chal dete hai ve kerala ke kaalti sthit apane gram kii ore
 As soon as the village enters the border, the storm of memories completely engulfs them
 'are, yahi to alwai nadi he
 i was caught by a crocodile while bathing in it
 matashri se mere sanyas kii anugna milne par hi usne mujhe mukt kiya tha
 There was so much compulsion in his mind while giving permission
 main unka ekmaatr santan
 He is also sanyasom oriented
 vansh shrinkhalaa ke uchhinn hone kii sthiti
 Service of Ekakini Mata- Problem of Sushruva
 phir bhi unhone mujhe sanyas kii anumati di
 'acharya arrives at the door of his house thinking all these things
 acharya kii aahat paakar grihasevika darwaja kholti he 
 Acharya reaches directly to Mother Mathaiya
 sanyasi rup main putr ko dekhakar mata ke netron se ashruvindu dhalakane lagate hai
 In this sequence, the mother's death is done
 matashri ke praan apne sanyasi putr kii utkar pratiksha main hi atake the
 Here eyes see the son, and the second moment Pran gives his body the body of a body with his extraction
 acharya shankar ne sanyas kii diksha lee he, ve parivrajak ho gayi hai
 According to the scriptures, they cannot touch fire
 unke saamne ek bhayankar dharmsankat surasa kii bhaanti munh baaye khadaa ho jaataa he
 If they offer oblation to the mother goddess, then sannyasa is revered by religion
 yadi mukhaagni nahin dete to putr dharm se vimukh hote he
 For some time Acharya's ascetic mind jumped from his mind and runs away
 uske sthaan par saamaanya chitt kaa pravesh ho jaataa he
 Seeing the maternal body, he deviates like a normal human
 matashri ke haathon ko apane haath main lekar ateet main kho jate hai
 Think 'I did so much service with these hands
 aaj ye haath itane paravash ho gayi hai
 In childhood, she used to rub me in the Poorna River with these hands
 khilaate samay saathi bacchon ke saath main khilne ke liye bhaag jaataa tha
 She used to run and catch me and feed with these hands
 inhen haathon se ve pratidin menre sharir par telumardan karti thim
 When Dadashree died, Mothershree wanted to spend the rest of her life with my mind
 par menre sanyasi hone ke pashchaat ve puri tarah se tut gayin
 In my absence, he had only one task left, waiting for death
 'acharya shankar ateet se vartmaan main utarate hai
 At the same time, the housekeeper whispers in his ear, 'your Namboodri family will not participate in the funeral procession of the mother
 unke asahyog kaa kaaran yah he ki ve aapke is krity ko shaastra viruddh or parampara viruddh maanate hai
 It is said that when a sannyasi gives up his home, it is against the scripture to return to his home principal
 agni sparsh uske liye sarvatha varjit he
 We cannot support Acharya Shankar in working against such scriptures
 sevika kii baat sunakar acharya ek kshan ke liye udign ho jate hai
 They do not understand how they will go to the crematorium with the dead body of mother alone
 kuch samay ke liye ve kinkartavyavimudh ho jate hai
 Suddenly a solution flashes in his mind
 'matashri ke shav ko shmashaan ghat par na le jaakar yadi grih parisar main hi antyeshti kar di jaay to isamen kya aapatti ho sakati he
 ʼ Some such feeling comes in the mind of Acharya
 sagotri log dur se hi acharya kii dwividha kaa anand le rahe hai
 No one supports them in these moments of disaster
 antatah acharya shankar apane ghar ke saamne hi chita sajaate hai
 Somehow the body of the mother is placed on the pyre
 haath main agnishikha lekar chita kii parikrama karte hue shav ko mukhaagni dete hai
 Acharya converts the house premises into a crematorium
 chita se uthi lapaton ko dekhakar acharya ko lagata he jaise agni dev unki mata ke sookshm sharir ko lekar pitralok kii ore prayaag kar rahe hai
 Gradually the flames of the pyre calm down but the mind of the Acharya gets upset for his relatives
 sochate hai, itani baari vipattiyon me hamaare sagotriyo ne sahanubhuti kaa ek shabd bhi muh se nahin nikaala
 This mentality of Acharya Shankar leads to a curse, "now the people of this gotra will not cremate the crematorium like me, but in front of their house
 " 'mrisha na hoi dev rishi vaani' siddhanth ke anusaar kerala ke kaalti gram main namboodri brahmanon me aaj bhi shav-dah ghar ke saamne hi kiya jaataa he
 After a long trek from Kerala, he reached Omkarnath on the banks of river Narmada
 vahaan guru govindpad se yoga shiksha tathaa advait brahm gyaan praapt karne lage
 Acharya Shankar continued to practice the Advaita element for three years
 tatpashchaat guru ajna se ve kaashi vishwanath ji ke darshan ke liye nikal pade
 While he was going to Kashi, a Chandal came in his way
 unhone krodhit ho chandal ko vahaan se hat jane ke liye kaha to chandal bolaa- ‘he muni! aap shariron main rahane vaale ek paramatma kii upeksha kar rahe hai, isliye aap abrahman hai
 Therefore, move away from my path
 ’ chandal kii devvani sun acharya shankar ne ati prabhavit hokar kaha-‘aapane mujhe gyaan diya he, at: aap mere guru hue
 Saying this, when Acharya Shankar bowed down to him, he was seen by Shiva and four deities in place of Chandal
 kaashi main kuch din rahane ke dauraan ve mahishmati nagari main acharya mandan mishra se milane gaye
 The domesticated hyena that was home to Acharya Mishra also chanted Veda mantras
 mishra ji ke ghar jaakar acharya shankar ne unhen shastrarth main haraa diya
 Seeing the defeat of her husband Acharya Mishra, wife Acharya said to Shankar - 'mahatmaan! You have just won half a part
 apni yuktiyon se mujhe parajeet karke hi aap vijayi kahala sakenge
 ' tab mishra ji kii patni bharti ne kaamshaastra par prashn karne prarambh kiye
 But Acharya Shankar was a child-celibate, so where would he answer his questions related to work? On this, he asked for a few days time from Bharti Devi and entered into the body and got all the information about that subject
 iske baad acharya shankar ne bharti ko bhi shastrarth main haraa diya
 During his stay in Kashi, he defeated even more learned Pandits in a debate and became famous on the Guru's post
 anek shishyon ne unase diksha grahan kii
 After this, he started promoting religion
 vedant prachaar main sanlagn rahakar unhone anek granthon kii rachana bhi kii
 The Advaita Brahmist Acharya Shankar believed only the uninterrupted Brahman to be true and was immersed in the Brahmana
 ek baar ve brahm muhoort main apane shishyon ke saath ek ati sankri gali se snaan hetu manikarnika ghat ja rahe the
 On the way, a young woman sat mourning her dead husband's head in his lap
 acharya shankar ke shishyon ne us stri se apane pati ke shav ko hataakar rasta dene kii prarthana kii, lekin vah stri use ansuna kar rudan karti rahi
 Then Acharya himself requested him to remove the body
 unka aagrah sunakar vah stri kehane lagi- ‘he sanyasi! aap mujhase baar-baar yah shav hataane ke liye kah rahe hai
 Why don't you ask this dead body to be removed? ' Hearing this, Acharya said- 'O Goddess! You may have forgotten in mourning that the body itself does not have the power to move
 ’ stri ne turant uttar diya- ‘mahatman aapaki drushti main to shakti nirpeksh brahm hi jagat kaa karta he
 Then why can't this dead body be removed without power? ' Acharya sat there after hearing such a serious, knowledgeable, mysterious sentence of that woman
 unhen samadhi lag gai
 In the inner eye, he saw - everywhere Adyashakti Mahamaya Leela is mourning
 unka hriday anivarchaneey anand se bhar gaya or mukh se matra vandana kii shabdamayi dhara stotra banakar foot padi
 Now Acharya Shankar became such an ocean in which streams of monotheism, monotheism, pure virtue, specific dualism, devotion to virtuous realization with Nirguna Brahman wisdom started to shake together
 unhone anubhav kiya ki gyaan kii advait bhoomi par jo paramatma nirgun niraakaar brahm he, vahi dwait kii bhoomi par sagun saakaar he
 He considered the worship of Saguna to be the inevitable ladder to reach Nirguna by supporting both Nirguna and Saguna
 gyaan or bhakthi kii milan bhoomi par yah bhi anubhav kiya ki advait gyaan hi sabhi saadhnaaon kii param uplabdhi he
 He also proclaimed 'brahman Satyam Jaganmithya' and also composed devotional hymns of Shiva, Parvati, Ganesh, Vishnu etc
, composed the best texts like 'soundarya Lahiri', 'vivek Chudamani'
 prasthaan trayee ke bhashya bhi likhe

 hindu varnashram main brahmanon kii vyavastha praaia: apdasth ho gai
 Two classes of all Brahmins took place all over the country - Panch Gaur for North Indian Brahmins and Panch Dravidian class for South Indian Brahmins
 panch goud - saswath, gore, kanyakubj, maithil or utkal; panch dravid - maharashtra, tailang yaa andhra, dravid yaa tamil, karnataka tathaa gu ke bich kii vibhaajan rekha narmada nadi maani jaati he
 Many tribes are also considered within Panch Gaur, in which competition for superiority over each other has so far remained
 bundelkhand main adhikanshat: jijhautiya brahman hi mukhya rahai hai
 The classes of Kanyakubj, Saryuparin Sana and other Brahmins were not here before a century
 prarambh main inkaa kaary mandiron main puja karnaa or shaskaon kaa mantri hona tha baad main inhen jaagir or sandein mili to ye krishi, naukari aadi main bhi pravruth ho gaye
 The Brahmins have been given cognates on the basis of origin
 bundelkhand main inaki upjatiyaan ahivaasee, jizotiyaa, kanaujia, khedawal, maalavi, nagar, narmdev, sanadhy, sarbariyaa or utkal kii pai jaati he
 Adjectives like Vipra, Dwij, Baman Shrotriya Maharaj etc
 are added to them
 purv or uttar main brahman maance bhakshan karte hai pashchim main vemsak kaa pani pite hai parantu bundelkhand main iskaa chalan nahin he
 a Brahmin eats pucca kitchen with another
 inke kuch gunon kii jahaan prashansa hoti he vahiin par inke sambandh main janashrutiyaan bhi he - Vip Parousi Ajay Dhan, Bitian Kau Darbar
 ete pai dhan na ghate pipar rakhu duaar
 
 wipro vaid naao nripati swaan sout manjaar
 Where the world is, there is no place 
 Kariya Vaman, Gore Chamar, don't get down with them
 brahmanon ke baad bundelkhand kii duusari jati kshatriya he jinke 36 prakaar athwa upjatiyaan yahan pai jaati hai
 Rasail states that in terms of his nobility it is difficult to tell who are pure blood? Most of the Parmar Bisen, Bundela, Banafar, Chandel, Madouria, Kachwaha, Tomar, Chauhan, Dhakad, Haidavanshi, Kalamuri "kalar" etc
 are also found prominently in Bundelkhand
 inhen ke saath dangi bhi apane ko thakur kehete hai
 They are considered to be cultivators till the medieval period
 karmiyon main urrente, chandanas, singore, lodhi aadi anek upjatiyaan hai
 Due to the ruling class, the practice of polygamy, child marriage and meat and alcohol has been prevalent till now
 daangi sagar main vishesh sankhya main hone ke kaaran is pradesh ko dangipada bhi kaha jaataa he
 By the way, in relation to the dangers, it is that they belong to the Jagali caste; Even though they do not have a crime attitude, they are said to be - khet main basi gaan main daangi Whose mare, Titgai, stunned teen main na tera main, mrudang bajaave deraa main
 Perhaps it is prevalent due to clever tendencies and unreliable objection
 rajputon main daangiyon kii bhanti devi kii puja pramukh he
 The rest are like Vaishnavism and Shakta worshipers in customs
 vaisya jinke anek naam baniyaa, vani, mahajan, seth, sahuukaar aadi prachlit hai ye vastav main sudur ateet main anaaj, ghi or anya manihari kaa samaaj bechney waal the
 After medieval, his work became banking and agriculture
 vaisya do prakaar ke hai - jain or hindu
 It was not a separate division until much after the medieval period
 jain - baniyaa, oswaal, saitavaal, paravaar, gola, ghurab, charnapar, baghelwal, samaiya aadi upjatiyon main vibhajit hai
 Hindus are known by surnames like Baniya, Agarwal, Asati, Ghoi, Kesarwani, Maheshwari, Nema etc
 jain baniyaa digambar yaa shwetambar hote hai or parasnath, bahubali ko maanate hai
 Hindu Baniyas are completely Vaishnavite
 asati ke bare main janashruti hai - "ardha jaale ardha gaare, jinka naas asati paare' inaki utpatti ke sambandh main anek mat hai
 Ghoi Vaishnavas are Hindus
 maheshwari main 72 kul maane jate hai
 The Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas are originally associated with the Aryans and the non-aryan origin of the remaining castes is considered
 inamen saamaajik str ke anusaar shudra sabase neeche or unke upar anya sabhi vyavsaayik or kaamgaar jatiyaan aati hai
 Chamar, Mochi, Kori, Teli, Bakhor, Pasi, Potter etc
 are counted at the lowest level
 inaki gatishiltaa se kahin adhik ghosi, dhobi, gadriya, gujars, ahir, lodhiadi kii hoti he
 In the business category, goldsmiths, blacksmiths, thothera, carpenters, kasera have been given other status whereas Banjara, Kunjra, Bhadbhuja, Baniya Khatri etc
 have been ranked on the basis of their work
 kachera, lakhera yaa mali, kaddi, chaurasia yaa barai kii bhi isi prakaar sthiti maani gai he
 The importance of all these castes has diminished in the modern era
 anek nichle str ke kahe jane vaale, naukari karne lage hai or varna kii vyavastha nagaron main praaia: kam ho gai he
 This is still the alleged form in the villages
 prayek jati ke sath kuch janashrutiyaan bhi prasiddh hai - Lumpa snake Sannodia, milieu take hands carts
 teen ghar tera chuulhe
 Brahmins go back and forth in front
 oi baans ke daal tokna, oi ke chalani sap
 Amaiju, the king of Oi Khu, the brother of Oi Khu
 
 Live for a year and go and beat the jackpot

 bundeli samaaj main dravid utpatti kii jatiyon main goud vishesh hai
 Their customs have also affected the remaining castes
 musalamaanon ke aagaman ke baad jo vibhinn jati ke log graamon or nagaron main based unamem bahna ke sandarbh main matbhed hai
 The fundamentalist Hindu says - turuk to turuk or bahna turuk
 Achera Kachera Cage mohammad se dur, deen se nyaara Half Hindu Hindu Muslim tinkhon kahan dhunuk padhaa na
 
 shekhon kii shekhi, pathaanon kii dai
 Turkshi of Turks, sister's brother
 
 In this way people of different castes of Bundelkhand live but have their own religion, rituals, rites etc
 mukhya jansankhya brahman, kshatriya, vaishyon or kaamgaar logon kii he jo vastav main vaishnav, shakt, shaiva, jain, musalmaan or isai hai
 The present Bundeli society is bound by certain festivals and customs
 nagaron sein iskaa chalan kam, kasbon or graamon main vishesh he
 People of lower castes are still victims of witchcraft, blind faith, polytheism, stereotypes and ignorance as compared to people of higher varnas
 samantvaad is pradesh main pandrahavin shatabdi ke baad vishesh rup se rahaa he, isiilie uske donon prakaar ke prabhaav milte hai
 On the Sad side, where Hinduism, cultural revival has been taking place for the protection of caste, the memorial samples of temples and architecture have been constructed, while feudalism has also been exploited in that direction
 aadim das pratha, varg shashan satta se mukti samantvaad ne di thi parantu yahi ptha baad main aarthik, raajnneetik or bauddhik utpedan kaa kaaran bana
 Class society was made permanent under feudalism
 parinaam swarup shaasha ek hi jati ke hue
 The rule of rulers proved to be a hindrance to progress from the dynasty tradition
 bundelkhand ke pichde hone kaa pramukh kaaran yahi he ki pichley paanch-chah sau varshon main janata ko shasnadhin rahanaa padaa, dharm, samskruti saamaajik aachaar-vichaar bhi shaskaon ke dwaara tha unki nakal par apanaaye gayi
 At the same time, the allegiance of divinity took place in the feudatories
 bundelkhand main bundela shaskaon ko "ju dev' unke naam ke saath lagaaya janaa isi pravriti kaa dyotak he
 Ethnic bigotry, syncretism at religious and cultural levels resulted in the twentieth century coming into contact with Western civilization, which brought about remarkable changes in the middle class
 dharm, samskruti parampara or saamaajik agatikta ko nayi peedi ne ekadam jhaadkar swatantra hone kii prakriya apanaai
 On reaching one extreme, she became a follower of the West, while on the other extreme, people could not get out of archaic values and stereotypes
 uttar madhyakaal main bundelkhand main upasnaon ke kshetra main atyadhik milti he
 The Kshatriyas and their respective castes have shown many devotion towards Shakti, Durga, Vindhyavasini, Sarada Devi of Maihar etc
 navaratri main upwas rakhana, siddh sthanon par meley lagaana, kul devi kii puja karnaa or shakti ke anek rup maananaa, shaasha varg kii rivaaj sa ho gaya
 Not only did Shaiv worship in the name of Shiva, Shankar, Pashupati etc
 related to Shakti, many Shiva temples were also built
 kabir kii parampara main akshar anany tathaa kaviyon nirgun ishwar kii upasna kii
 Their communities were also formed, it also progressed from the time of Chhatrasal
 prannath sampradaay ke do kendra baad bhi gatisheel rahaa
 Krishnopasana was predominant in the Braj region in Bhaktikal, Bundelkhand became its center in the North Middle Ages
 ramopasna kaa prabhaavshaalee shriganesh orchha main hua tha
 The construction of the temple of "ram Raja" and celebrating the festival of Ram Navami with pomp became a state task
 dashahra, diwaali or shivaratri ke parvon ko badi dhoomdhaam se manaaya jane laga
 The recognition of Gaur, Bhil and other classes was less than that of the Savarnas
 thakur, baba, goud baba, daroiya baba, khabbis-baba, hardol-lala, karas dev, ghatoiya deva, puja dev, doolhi baba tathaa kher mata, hinglaj mata, marai mata, harisiddhi devi, danteshwari devi aadi shaktiyon kii vibhinn prakaar upasnaen, anushthane or pujaayen anya virgon main prachlit raheen
 There was no difference in the experiments of tonatoke, sacrifice, magic, broom, etc
 janm se mrityu tak ke samast sanskaron aadi daalane kii parampara bundelkhand ke sabhi virgo ke logon main prachlit he yah vastut: anarya samskruti kii dein he
 Non-vegetarian classes have also become vegetarian
 kaanon main bali pahananaa kshatriyon yaa samanton ke prabhaav main shuru hua tha, yah bhi chalan ab band ho rahaa he
 Shiva was the god of non-aryans but in the pre-medieval era he became the deity of Aryans
 gramin samaaj ab bhi paramparaon, rudhiyon, andhvishwaason kaa paalan kar rahaa tha
 Raj Kumar, Death - 3 July 1996 Mumbai) was an Indian actor in Hindi films
 inkaa naam kulbhushan pandit tha lekin filmi duniya main ye apane duusare naam 'raaj kumaar' ke naam se prasiddh hai
 He adopted the traditional Parsi theater dialogues and this became his special identity
 inke dwaara abhinit prasiddh filmon main paigaam, vaqt, neelkamal, pakiza, maryaada, hir ranjha, saudagar aadi hai
 In the Hindi cinema world, many stars ruled the hearts of the audience due to their strong acting, but there was one such star, who was considered not only by the audience but also by the entire film industry as 'rajkumar' and he was the uncrowned king of dialogue payment Kulbhushan Pandit aka Rajkumar
 pakistan ke baluchistan praant main 8 oktober 1926 ko janme rajkumaar snaatak kii padhai puri karne ke baad mumbai ke mahim thane main sab inspector ke rup main kaam karne lage
 One day while patrolling at night, a soldier told the prince that Hazur, you are no less than a hero in color and stature
 filmon main yadi aap hero ban jaayen to lakhon dilon par raaj kar sakate hai or rajkumaar ko sipaahi kii yah baat janch gayi
 Rajkumar was employed in the police station in Mumbai
 vahaan aksar film udyog se jude logon kaa aana-janaa laga rahata tha
 Once, filmmaker Baldev Dubey came to the police station for some important work
 vah rajkumaar ke baatcheet karne ke andaaj se kaaphi prabhavit hue or unhone rajkumaar se apni film 'shahi bazaar' main abhinayta ke rup main kaam karne kii peshkash kii
 Rajkumar had already made up his mind to become an actor after listening to the soldier
 isliye unhone turant hi apni sab inspector kii naukari se istipha de diya or nirmaataa kii peshkash sweekaar kar lee
 It took a long time for the royal market to be built and the prince also found it difficult to make a living
 isliye unhone varsh 1952 me pradarshit film 'rangili' main ek choti si bhoomika sweekaar kar lee
 When did this film enter the cinema houses and when did it go away
 yah pataa hi nahin chalaa
 Meanwhile, his film 'shahi Bazaar' was also released
 jo box offis par aundhe munh giri
 After the failure of the royal market, all the relatives of Rajkumar started saying that your face is not suitable for the film
 or kuch log kehane lage ki tum khalanaayak ban sakate ho
 From 1952 to 1957, Rajkumar struggled to make a mark in the film industry
 'rangili' ke baad unhen jo bhi bhoomika mili rajkumaar use sweekaar karte chale gaye
 Meanwhile, he starred in many films like 'anmol' 'sahara', 'opportunity', 'ghamand', 'neelamani' and 'krishna Sudama' but none of these films were successful at the box office
 varsh 1957 main pradarshit mehboob khan kii film madar india main raaj kumaar gaanv ke ek kisaan kii choti si bhoomika main dikhaai die
 Though the film was entirely focused on actress Nargis, Raj Kumar managed to leave a mark of her acting in her minor role
 is film main unke damdaar abhinay ke liye unhen antarrashtriya khyaati bhi mili or film kii safalataa ke baad raaj kumaar bataur abhinayta film industry main sthapit ho gaye
 In the film 'paigaam', released in 1959, he had the acting Emperor Dilip Kumar of the Hindi film industry in front of him, but Raj Kumar also managed to rob the applause of the audience through his strong role here
 iske baad raaj kumaar 'dil apana or preet paraai-1960', 'gharaana- 1961', 'godaan- 1963', 'dil ek mandir- 1964', 'dooj kaa chand- 1964' jaisi filmon main mili kamyaabi ke zariye raaj kumaar darshako ke bich apane abhinay kii dhak jamaate hue aisi sthiti main pahunch gayi jahaan vah film main apni bhoomika swayan chun sakate the
 After the tremendous success of the film Kajal released in 1965, Raj Kumar made his own identity as an actor
 varsh 1965 bi
aar
chopra kii film vaqt main apane laajawab abhinay se vah ek baar phir se apni ore darshak kaa dhyaan aakarshith karne main safal rahe
 At the time of the film, Raj Kumar spoke a dialogue, "chinayi Seth, whose houses are made of glass, do not throw stones at others, or if Cheney Seth does not cut the hand of children playing knives, then the blood comes out" Been quite popular in the middle
 film vaqt kii kamyaabi se raaj kumaar shoharat kii buladiyon par ja pahunche
 In such a situation, when an actor comes in front of him, he starts to be arbitrary and his tendency to lose fame increases and soon he is also tied into a particular image
 lekin raaj kumaar kabhi bhi kisi khaas image main nahin bandhe isaliye apni in filmo kii kamyaabi ke baad bhi unhone 'humaraaz- 1967', 'neelkamal- 1968', 'mere hujur- 1968', 'hir ranjha- 1970' or 'pakiza- 1971' main romani bhoomika bhi sweekaar kii jo unke filmi charitra se mail nahin khaati thi iske baavjood bhi raaj kumaar yahan darshakon kaa dil jeetne main safal rahe
 In the film Karmayogi released in the year 1978, new dimensions of Raj Kumar's acting and diversity were seen by the audience
 is film main unhone do alag-alag bhoomikaaon main apane abhinay kii chhap chodi
 Raj Kumar introduced himself in various roles to avoid uniformity in acting and also to establish himself as a character actor
 is kram main varsh 1980 main pradarshit film bulandi main vah charitra bhoomika nibhaane se bhi nahin hichake or is film ke jariye bhi unhone darshako kaa man mohe rakhaa
 After this Raj Kumar followed 'kudrat - 1981', 'dharmakanta - 1982', 'sharara - 1984', 'rajatilak - 1984', 'A new Paheli - 1984', 'marte Dum Tak - 1987', 'surya - 1989' Many superhit films like 'jangbaaz- 1989', 'police Public- 1990', ruled the hearts of the viewers
 varsh 1991 main pradarshit film 'saudagar' main rajkumaar ke abhinay ke nae aayam dekhne ko mili
 In this film produced by Subhash Ghai, Rajkumar was opposite Dilip Kumar for the second time after the 1959 film 'paigam' and the confrontation between these two masters of the acting world was worth watching
 nabbe ke dashak main raaj kumaar ne filmon me kaam karnaa kaafii kam kar diya
 During this period, films like Raj Kumar's 'tiranga - 1992', 'police and the God of Humanity - 1993', 'betaz Badshah - 1994', 'jawab - 1995', 'god and Gun' were released
 nitant akele rahane vaale raaj kumaar ne shaayad yah mahasoos kar liya tha ki maut unke kaafii qareeb he isiilie apane putr puru raaj kumaar ko unhone apane paas bula liya or kaha, "dekho maut or zindagi insaan kaa nijee maamla hota he
 Don't tell my death to anyone other than my friend Chetan Anand
 meraa antim sanskaar karne ke baad hi film udyog ko suchit karnaa
 " filmi duniya ke sartaaj abhinayta rajkumaar 3 july 1996 main ke din hamen chhodkar chale gaye the
 But Rajkumar's acting style, his white shoes and his dialogue are alive in the audience till date
 chinoy seth, jinke ghar shishe ke bane hote hai wo dusron par pathar nahin phenkate
 Movie 'waqt'
