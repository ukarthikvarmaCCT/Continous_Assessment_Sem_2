 maujuuda qimaton or fasal kii kataai ke samay purvanumaan staron ke aadhaar par, kisaan yah vichaar kar saktaa he ki kis mausam main gehun bona acha he, lekin purvanumaan mulya keval purvanumaan hi hai
 Once a farmer sows wheat, he is committed to it for the entire growing season
 yadi fasal ke bone or kaatane ke bich gehun kii vaastavik qeemat main bahut adhik vruddhi hoti he, to kisaan apratyaashit rup se paisa bana saktaa he, lekin agar kataai ke samay vaastavik qeemat main giravat aati he, to vah barbaad ho saktaa he
 If the farmer sells several prospective contracts of wheat at the time of sowing the crop, equal to the quantity of the crop, then at that time it effectively blocks the price of the wheat - the contract is an agreement according to which the future is on a given date , To give a certain quantity of wheat, at a fixed price
 usne gehun ke mulyon ke jokhim ke prati bachaav-vyavastha kar lee he; ab use is baat kii bilkul parvaah nahin he ki maujuuda qeemat main badhotaree hoti he yaa giravat, kyonki sanvida ke mutabik use ek nishchit mulya milane kii guarantee mil gai he
 Now he does not even have to worry that he should not face wastage due to reduction in price at the time of harvesting, but at the same time he misses the opportunity to earn more profit due to increase in price at the time of harvesting
 
 ek share vyapaaree maanata he ki company k dwaara upkarnon ke utpaadan kii nai or kushal paddati apnaane ke kaaran, agle maheene company ke sheyaron kii qimaton main vruddhi hogi
 vah company k ke share kharid kar, unke anumaanit mulya vruddhi se munaafaa kamanaa chahta he
 But the company is part of a much more volatile equipment industry
 agar vyapaaree keval is vishwaas par share kharidta he ki company k ke share kii qeemat kam lagaai gai he, to vah sauda satta he
 Since the trader is interested in the company and not in the industry, he makes short-term sales of shares of company a at a price equal to company b to protect against industrial risk
 agar vyapaaree, kisi aisi sampatti kii mandadia bikri karne main kaamyaab hota he, jisaki qeemat kaa, company k ke share mulyon ke saath ganitiya rup se paribhaashit sambandh ho, to yah sauda tatvatah jokhim-rahit he
 But in this case the risk is reduced, but does not end at all
 pehle din vyapaaree kaa sanvibhag he:$1 prati share kii dar se company k ke 1000 deergh share $2 prati share kii dar se company kha ke 500 alp share duusare din, upkaran udyog ke bare main ek anukool samachar prakashit hota he or upkaran share kii qeemat bad jaati he
 Company A, being a strong company, goes up 10%, while Company b only goes up 5%
 company k kaa 1000 deergh share $1
10 prati share kii dar se: munaafaa $100 500 small shares of Company b at the rate of $ 2
10 per share: Loss $ 50 vyapaaree ko duusare din bachaav par khed ho saktaa he, kyonki usne company k kii sthiti main munaafe ko gata diya he
 But on the third day, an unfavorable news is published regarding the impact on the health of the equipment and the prices of all the equipment stocks fall immediately: in a few hours the value of the appliance industry decreases by 50%
 phir bhi, chunki company k ek acchhee company he, ise company kha se kam khona padataa he
 Long Term Price: alp sthiti main mulya : Without a hedge, the trader could have incurred a loss of $ 450
 But the hedge — the slowing sales of Company b — makes a profit of $ 475, at a net profit of $ 25 when the market drops dramatically
 mukhya lekh:southwest airlines # eendhan bachaav-vyavastha Southwest Airlines uses future contracts and derivatives to hedge its risk against jet fuel prices

 Another example is that of a company that opens a subsidiary in another country and borrows in local currency to finance its operations, although the local interest rate may be more expensive from its home country: local currency The parent company has reduced its foreign exchange risk by matching loan payments to expected income in the US
 isi tarah, ek tel nirmaataa america dollar main apni aay praapt karne kii apeksha kar saktaa he, lekin ek alag mudra main laagat kii bharpai karata he; agar yah anukool ho, to yah ek swaabhaavik bachaav ko lagu karnaa hoga, udhaaharan ke liye, karmchaariyon ko bonus kaa bhugtan america dollar main karnaa
 The earliest means of hedge against risk is to insure for protection against financial loss due to accidental property damage or loss, personal injury, or loss of life
 niryaatkon hetu, nimnlikhit jokhimon kii shreniyon ke liye, ayaatkon ke mulya ke prati unki lekha mudra main giravat aati he, jise asthir jokhim bhi kehete hai
 Future contracts and futures contracts are a means of hedging against the risk of adverse market movements

 vittiya niveshak ek bachaav nidhi ho sakati he, jo ek company main, maan len brazil main, nivesh kaa faisalaa leti he, lekin zaruri nahin ki vah brazil mudra main nivesh karen
 bachaav nidhi, mudra jokhim ke "bachaav-vyavastha" dwaara vaastavik brazili mudra ke jokhim se rin jokhim ko alag kar sakati he
 In fact, this means that the investment is effectively a US dollar investment in Brazil
 bachaav-vyavastha, niveshak ko apane mudra jokhim ko kisi or ko antarit karne kii anumati detii he, jo us mudra main sthaan grahan karnaa chahta he
 Similar to insurance against other types of events, the hedge fund has to pay the other investor for the currency investment

 If Vodafone has beta 2, then in Vodafone's 1 xxrep 4 0 GBP long position you will hedge with short position equal to 2 xxrep 4 0 GBP in future FTSE transactions
 yadi aap praathmik taur par bhavi saude karte hai, to aap kritrim bhavi saudon ke prati apane vaayadon kaa bachaav karte hai
 Artificial in this case is an artificial futures, which includes demand and sell positions
 deergh kritrim bhavi saudon kaa matlab usee samaapan mulya par deergh maang or alp vikray he
 So if you make long futures in your deal, you can hedge by artificial short futures and vice versa

 agar nirmaataa or khudara vyapaaree ek vyapaar avadhi main 1 mwh ke liye, $50 prati mwh ke tay mulya ke liye sahamat hote hai or yadi vaastavik samooh mulya $70 he, to nirmaataa ko samooh se $70 miltaa he, par use khudara vyapaaree ko $20 kii chhot deni padati he
 Conversely, if the group price is lower than the agreed contractual price, the retailer will pay the difference to the manufacturer
 vastav main, samooh kii asthirataa nirast ho jaati he or pakshakaar $50 prati mwh adaa or praapt karte hai
 However, the party who pays the difference is "without money", because without hedging they would have received the benefit of group value

 preran kundali kam voltata vaale strot se ucch voltata praapt karanevaali ek yukti he
 It consists of two coils wrapped on one core, called primary and secondary
 praathmik kundali main dwitiyak kii apeksha bahut kam lapeten hoti hai
 This coil is connected to a battery by a switch
 yah switch sampark or viched prakaar kaa hota he, jisamen ek kamaani lagi rahati he
 The segmental tip has a malleable iron contact
 sansparshak kaa sira platinum dhaatu kaa bana hota he, jisase baar baar arq banane par bhi sansparshak khat na ho
 In general, this contactor contacts another stationary contactor and thus the circuit of the primary coil is completed and current flows in it

 The secondary horoscope is also located in this region and is thus under its influence
 jab praathmik kundali kaa kshetra kaaphi bad jaataa he, tab switch ke narm lohe kaa sansparshak praathmik kundali ke crode kii ore aakarshith ho jaataa he
 The core is also made of soft iron
 sansparshak ke crode kii ore khinch jane ke karan, uskaa sthir sansparshak se sansparsh tut jaataa he; or is prakaar praathmik kundali kii dhara kaa paripath puraa nahin rahata
 Due to this, the current flowing in it stops
 vastav main dhara ekadam shunya nahin ho jaati, varan kundali ke prerakatv ke karan usamen kuch kaal kaa vilamb hota he
 The magnetic field generated by the current is also dissipated in this way
 parantu aisa hone par, narm lohe kaa sansparshak bhi, crode kaa aakarshan samaapt ho jane ke kaaran, apni puraani sthiti par phenk diya jaataa he
 With this, he starts contacting the static contact again

 The primary and secondary coils are wrapped on the same core, ebonite or any other insulating tube, but they have no plan, either they are wrapped by enamelled wires, causing each other to be insulated; Or the secondary is wrapped with an insulating tube above the primary
 paripath ke baar baar banane or tuutane se donon sansparshakon ke bich arq utpann hota he
 Apart from this, there is also fear of fire, apart from the damage of contacts

 The higher voltage in the secondary coil by induction does not mean that it increases the power

 Thus if 1 ampere current is being taken at 12 volts in the primary coil, then the secondary coil will have only ampere current at 1200 volts

 }} In logic, mathematics and computer science, interpreting is the process of adding meaning to the symbols of a formal language
 adhikansh aupchaarik bhashaayen keval vaakyavinyas dwraara hi paribhaashit hoti hai or unamem koi nihit arth nahin hota
 To understand the meaning, it is necessary to associate the meaning with the signs

 Now, as a result, some words in this language will be: △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle} △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle}, △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle} ◻ { \ displaystyle \ square}, △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle} ◻ { \ displaystyle \ square} ◻ { \ displaystyle \ square} ◻ { \ displaystyle \ square} △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle}
 yadi ◻ { \ displaystyle \ square } △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle } shabd dekha jaae jo yah bhashaa kaa shabd nahin he kyonki yah niyam-ulanghan karata he
 Now one possible interpretation of this language can be that we can give 0 { \ displaystyle \ square} as '0' and △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle} as '1'
 agar aisa karen to △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle } ◻ { \ displaystyle \ square } ◻ { \ displaystyle \ square } ◻ { \ displaystyle \ square } △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle } kaa arth '10001' banataa he

 If a player fouls while attempting a shot and the shot is unsuccessful, the player is awarded a free throw equal to the amount of shot attempted
 ek khilaadi niyamit tu-point shot ke prayaas main faul ho jaataa he, to do shot praapt hote hai
 a player fouls in a three-point shot attempt, receiving three shots
 agar ek khilaadi shot ke prayaas main faul ho jaataa he or shot safal rahata he, to aam taur par khilaadi ko ek ank ke liye ek atirikt free thro pradaan kiya jaataa he
 In combination with a regular shot, it is called "three-point-play" or "four-point-play", due to a basket made at the time of the foul and an additional free throw
 haalanki niyam kisi bhi posishan ko nirdisht nahin karte hai, phir bhi ve basketbaal ke hisse ke rup main viksit ho gaye hai
 During the first five decades of basketball's development, one guard, two forwards and two centers or two guards, two forwards and one center were used
 1980 dashak ke baad se, adhik vishisht posishnon kaa vikaas hua, jinke naam hai: The above descriptions are flexible
 kuch avasaron par, kisi ek forward yaa centre ko tisare guard se pratisthapit karte hue timen, thri guard offence ke upyog kaa chayan karti hai
 The most interchangeable positions are point guard and shooting guard, especially if both players have good leadership and ball handling skills
 do mukhya rakshaatmak ranneetiyaan hai: zone difence or main-tu-main difence 
 zone difence main, jo khilaadi difence posishan main rahete hai, ve jo pratidwandvi unke zone main rahata he use guard karte hai
 In man-to-man defense, each defense player guards a specific opponent and tries to prevent him from taking action
 aakraamak khel main adhik vividhta he, jisamen aam taur par shaamil he niojit paas or bina gend ke khiladiyon kaa harakat karnaa
 ek laabhprad posishan hasil karne ke liye ek aakraamak khilaadi dwaara bina gend kii teevr harakat cat kahi jaati he
 An aggressive player's rightful attempt to prevent his partner from being guarded by an opponent, in which he stands in the way of the defender that his partner cuts side by side, is called a screen or pick
 donon khel pick and role main sanyukt hai, jisamen ek khilaadi ek pick set karata he or uske baad pick se dur tokari kii taraf "role" karata he
 Screen and cut are very important in aggressive games; These promote quick passes and teamwork, leading to a successful basket
 tiimon ke paas lagbhag hameshaa kai aakraamak khel niojit hote hai, yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki unki yojana agyaat rahe
court main, point guard aam taur par yah sanket dene ke liye jimmedaar he ki koun-sa khel hoga
 At high levels of basketball, the defensive and offensive structure and positions are emphasized; And this is what a coach usually requests a time-out to discuss
 shooting, tokari ke aar-paar gend phenk kar ank arjeet karne kaa prayaas he
 Although the methods may vary with players and situations, the most common technique is outlined as follows: khilaadi tokari kii ore munh kiye hue kandhe kii chaudaai ke baraabar pair failaakar, ghutane ko thodaa modakar or peeth ko sidhaa rakhte hue khadaa hota he
 The player places the ball slightly above the head on the fingers of the dominant hand, while the other hand supports the ball sideways
 gend ko nishane par rakhane ke liye, agr bahu ko tokari kii disha main rakhte hue, khilaadi kii kohni, khadey rup se ek sidh main honi chahie
mude ghutanon ko failaate hue or shooting haath ko sidhaa karte hue gend ko phenkaa jaataa he; gend ungaliyon ke poron se ghoomte hue jaati he, jabaki kalai purna neeche kii ore gaman ko puraa karti he
 The shooting arm is held steady for a moment after throwing the ball with a full spread, while the wrist is fully bent and the fingers pointing downward, known as follow through
 Doing it correctly increases shot accuracy
 aam taur par, gair-shooting haath kaa prayog shot ko keval disha dene ke liye kiya jaataa he, us par bal dene ke liye nahin
 Often players attempt to put a steady backspin on the rim to slow the impact of the ball
 shot kaa adarsh prakshep-path kinchit vivaad-yogya he, lekin aam taur par coach uchit chaap kii sifaarish karte hai
 Players can either shoot directly into the basket or redirect the ball to the basket using the backboard
 upar varnit paddati kaa prayog karne vaale do sabase aam shot hai, set shot or jamp shot 
set shot khadey posishan se kiya jaataa he, jisamen donon pair zamin par hi rahete hai or aam taur par iskaa istemaal free thro ke liye hota he
 Jump shot is made by bouncing in the air when the ball is thrown from the top height of the jump
 isse apekshaakrit adhik jor or vistaar miltaa he or saath hi, isse khilaadi ko difender se oonche hone kaa mauqaa miltaa he
 Failure to throw the ball before the foot is back on the ground is considered a travel violation
 ek anya aam shot he leap 
 is shot main khilaadi ko tokari kii ore gatisheel rahane kii aavashyaktaa he or gend ko tokari ke andar "le" "ap" karnaa hota he or aam taur par bechboard se hat kar 
bheed ke liye sabase adhik aanandadaayak or aam taur par sarvocch-pratishat sateek shot he slam dank, jisamen khilaadi bahut oonchi chalaang lagaataa he or gend ko neeche kii ore phenkata he, sidhe ghere ke aar-paar
 Another shot that is becoming more common is the "circus shot"
 a circus shot is a low-percentage shot that is shot by the shooter while unbalanced in the air, coming down and / or turning away from the basket, bouncing, or circling
 ek shot, jo rim or bechboard donon se puri tarah se chook jaataa he, air ball kehalaata he
 One particularly bad shot, or one that only hits the backboard, is jokingly called a brick
 ribounding kaa uddeshy ek free thro yaa field gol ke chook jane ke baad safaltaapurvak basketbaal kaa adhikaar praapt karnaa he, kyonki vah ghere yaa bechboard se palatataa he
 This plays a major role in the game, as most possession are eliminated after a team misses a shot
 ribound kii do shreniyan hai: aakraamak ribound, jisamen gend aakraamak paksh dwaara baraamad kii jaati he or qabja badalata nahin he or rakshaatmak ribound, jisamen bachaav team, mukt gend par punah qabja jamaati he
 Most rebounds are defensive, since the team that is in defense is in a better position to recover a missed shot
 khilaadiyon ke bich gend ko pahunchane kii vidhi ko paas kehete hai
 When giving most passes, a step is taken for strength boost and the hands move to ensure accuracy
 ek pramukh paas chest paas he
 The ball goes directly from the passer's chest to the receiver's chest
 ek uchit chest paas main, veg badhaane ke liye anguuthe baahar kii ore tadakate hai or dephence ko pratikriya kaa mauqaa nahin miltaa
 Another type of pass is a bounce pass
 In this, the passer bounces the ball from his chest to the receiver's chest and takes it two-thirds of the distance
 gend court par girti he or resiver kii ore chali jaati he
 The bounce pass takes longer to complete than the chest pass, but it is also difficult for the opposing team to intercept
 Thus, players often use bounce passes on crowded occasions or to pass a defender
 overhead paas kaa prayog ek difender ke upar se gend paas karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The ball is released from above the passer's head
 outlet paas tab kiya jaataa he, jab ek team ko difensive ribound miltaa he
 The next pass after rebound is the outlet pass
 kisi bhi achche paas kaa mahatvapurn pahalu yah he ki ise rokna mushkil hota he
 Good passers pass the ball with great accuracy and know exactly where each of their teammates likes to get the ball
 aisa karne kaa ek vishesh tareeqa he, praapt karne vaale saathi ko bina dekhe gend paas karnaa
ise kaha jaataa he no luk paas Another advanced style of passing is the behind the back pass, which, according to its name, involves a passer throwing a ball to a teammate in the back
 haalanki kuch khilaadi aise paas ko prabhavi dhang se kar sakate hai, tathaapi kai prashikshak no-luk yaa bihaind da back paas ko protsaahit nahin karte, unka maananaa he ki ise niyantrit karnaa mushkil he or isamen turnovers yaa ulanghan kii adhik sambhaavna he
 The action of bouncing the ball continuously with one hand is called dribbling and for a player to step up with the ball, it is an expectation
 drible karne ke liye, ek khilaadi gend ko hatheli se maarane ke bajaae ungaliyon se zamin kii ore neeche dhakka detaa he; yah adhik niyantran sunishchit karata he
 When dribbling and passing in front of an opponent, the dribbler should dribble with his hands at the maximum distance from the opponent, making it more difficult for the defensive player to get the ball
 Therefore it is important for a player to be able to dribble competently with both hands
 achche drible karne vaale gend ko bhoomi par kam uchhaalate hai, jisase gend kii haath se zamin tak kii yatra main duuri kam ho jaati he or isse difender ke liye gend "churaana" or adhik kathin ho jaataa he
 Good ball operators dribble from behind their backs, between their legs, and suddenly change direction, creating an unintelligible dribbling method that makes it more difficult to defend against
 yah crossover kehalaata he, jo dribling karte hue difender se aage nikalne kaa sabase prabhavi tareeqa he
 a skilled player can dribble the ball without seeing it, using dribble speed or peripheral vision to keep track of the ball's position
 gend par dhyaan kendrit karne kii aavashyaktaa naa hone par ek khilaadi team ke saathiyon ko yaa ank arjeet karne ke mauqon ko dekh saktaa he, saath hi saath, apane paas se kisi or dwaara gend chura liye jane ke khatare ko taal saktaa he
 a block is executed when, after a shot attempt, a defender succeeds in converting the shot by touching the ball
 khel ke lagbhag sabhi sanskarnon main, jab gend apane daayre se neeche ke raste main ho, gend ko choona avaidh he; yah goltending ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 It is also illegal to block a shot after touching the backboard, or when any part of the ball is directly above the rim
 ek shot ko block karne ke liye ek khilaadi ko, jis oonchai se shot chhuti he usase adhik upar tak pahunchane main sakasham hona hoga
 is prakaar, blocking main oonchai ek laabh ke rup main ho sakati he
 Players who are taller and typically play at the power forward or center position register more blocks than shorter taller players playing at guard positions
 haalanki, achche samay-prabandhan or paryaapt ucch urdhwadhar chalaang ke dwaara, chote qad ke khilaadi bhi prabhavi shot blowers ho sakate hai
 At the professional level, most male players are above 6 feet 3 inches and most women above 5 feet 7 inches
 Guards, for whom physical coordination and ball handling skills are important, are usually the shortest players
 purush pro lig main lagbhag sabhi forward 6 feet 6 inch yaa lambey hai
 Most centers are longer than 6 feet 10 inches
 sabhi NBA tiimon ko die gaye surveykshan ke anusaar, sabhi NBA khilaadiyon kii ausat oonchai bas 6 feet 7 inch ke neeche he or ausat vazan 222 pound ke qareeb

 Karen Harney, born on 16 September 1985 in Germany, is famous as a feminist psychologist and psychoanalyst
 harani ne apni kitaab ‘neurosis and human growth’ main neurosis ko manovishleshan ke paridrishy main dekha he
 Due to interest in his subject, he has formulated the theory on neurosis by analyzing the facts obtained from his patients
 harani kaa maananaa tha ki neurosis ek satat prakriya he jo saamanyat: jeevanabhar chalati rahati he
 In neurosis, Harney found the paradox that this life-long process also has an adverse or negative impact on human condition, such as severe mental conditions, external stimuli, bereavement, divorce, or negative experiences during childhood and adolescence
 This causes a negative problem in individuals
 harani ke yah vichaar samakaleen siddhanton ke vipareet the
 Because they believed that neurosis is also necessary for a good life
 harani kaa yah maananaa tha ki bachapan ke dauraan aanevaale nakaaratmak prabhaavon ke kaaran hi iske parinaam dekhe ja sakate he
 Neurosis can be easily understood on the basis of the relationship between the parents and the child, so an in-depth study of their relationship is necessary

 Harney, as a psychiatrist, defines ten patterns of neurotic needs based on the experiences based on facts derived from his patients
 in neurotic aavashyaktaaon main vah sari aavashyaktaaen he jo ek vyakti ko jivan safal banane main upyogi hai
 Although it is brief these can be further modified
 karen harani ke anusaar di gai neurotic aavashkataayen nimna hai- a
 Moving people 1
 sneh or anumodan kii aavashyaktaa; anya logon dwaara unako pasand kiya janaa
 2
 the need for a partner; Whom he can love, with whom all problems will be solved
 aa
 logon ke khilaaf badhanaa 3
 Strength requirement; Will try to get the power of his desires and control over others, maybe he will get frustrated, yet will continue to seek powerful person and strength
 4
 dusron ke shoshan kii aavashyaktaa; logon kaa behatar upyog karne ke liye evam unke uchit istemaal ke liye unhen badhaava dena, jodna-todna aadi shaamil he
 5
 The need for social recognition; Would like to live in reputation and headlines
 6
 vyaktigat prashansha kii zarurat; vyakti ke apane aantarik evam bahya gunon ko moolyawaan banane ke liye isaki aavashyaktaa hoti he
 7
 The need for personal achievement; Achievement is necessary for a person, although he uses people for this, according to the requirement of serial number-3
 i
 logon se hatakar dur chalanaa 8
 The need for self-reliance and independence; As most desires are autonomous but want to cancel some other person who is deranged
 9
 purnataa kii aavashyaktaa; jab aap apane jivan ko aachhi tarah se chalaa kar paa rahe he, tab neurotic aapke saamne ek bhay pradarshit karegaa
 10
 Lastly, practice restrictively on the necessities of life in narrow limits; In this way, the person is exercising that this petty life is possible to live? On examining ten neurotic requirements, Harney placed them in three broad categories - 1
 anupaalan - ek or do aavashyaktaaen; 2
 Aggression or colossal - requirements from three to seven; 3
 algaav yaa tyaagna - aath se das tak kii aavashyaktaaen

 In modern astronomy, it is believed that when a cloud of molecules in space starts collapsing with gravity, it makes an adyagraha circle around a star
 pehle anu jamaa hokar dhul ke kan bana dete hai, phir kan milakar dale ban jate hai
 Due to the constant impact of gravity, these pulses cause collisions and congestion and gradually become large pieces of debris that form planets, satellites and separate objects simultaneously over time
 jo vastuen badi hoti hai unka gurutvkarshan taaqatvar hota he or ve apane-aap ko sikodkar ek gole kaa aakaar dhaaran kar leti hai
 These planets and satellites sometimes collide in the first stages of the creation of a planetary circle, which sometimes causes them to break and sometimes become larger

 Astronomers believe that sometimes the effects of gravity are such that a planet or satellite is thrown into space far away from its star like a catapult and is no longer part of the planetary plane

 White iron is a very brittle component for many structural uses, but due to good hardness and abrasion resistivity and relatively low cost, it is used in applications such as surfaces such as shell liners and lifters bars in slurry pump hair mills, and In automatic grinding mills, crushing coal and crushing the hair and rings and digging bucket backhoe | coiled curve) slurry pump hair mills In shell liners and lifter bars, and autogenous xxrep 5 ] dent steel is more common for this application)
 ghani dhalaai ko kaaphi teji se thanda karnaa or pighale padaarth ko thos bananaa kaaphi kathin he kyonki safed dhalwaan loha pighalta hi rahata he
 However, a shell of white cast iron was used for rapid cooling, after which the remaining material slowly cooled and turned into gray cast iron
 parinamswaroop casting se, jise sheethal dhalaai chilld casting kehete hai, kathor sataha or kuch-kuch kadaa interior kaa laabh miltaa he
 White cast iron can be made by using high percentage of chromium in iron, chromium Cr is a strong carbide forming element, so graphite precipitates from iron are suppressed at a sufficiently high percentage of chrome

 Because cast iron is relatively brittle, it is not suitable for purposes where a sharp edge or flexibility is required
 yah sampeedan ke tahat majboot he, lekin tanaav ke antargat nahin
 Cast iron was first invented in China, and cast molten metal into molds to make figurines and weapons

 The use of cast iron for structural purposes began in the late decades of 1770, when Abraham Derby III built an iron bridge, although smaller beams were already in place, such as have been used in blast furnaces at Colebrookdale

 nichle kinaaron main kam tanaav ke saath, bims ke kendron main jhukaav tha, jisame dhalwaan lohe kii tarah, chinai kaaphi kamjor thi
 The best way to use cast iron for the construction of a bridge is to use arches, so that all materials remain in compression
 Cast iron, again like masonry, is very strong in compression

 Nevertheless, improper structural use of pig iron continued until the 1879 Tay Rail Bridge, a serious accident at the Tay Rail Bridge, for which the quality of the material in use was heavily suspected
 te brij main taai chhadon or tech lagane ke liye istemaal kiye gaye mahatvapurn lags ke saath kollam ke abhinn ang the or ve durghatana ke praarambhik daur main asafal rahe
 In addition, the bolt holes were also not pierced with the perforator, all the stresses falling on the length of the tie rods instead of extending the length of the holes which were placed in one corner
 pratisthaapan pul lohe or ispaat se banaaya gaya
 Further, the bridge collapsed, however, in 1891, a rail accident occurred at Norwood Junction
 Thousands of cast iron rails were eventually replaced with steel equivalents in bridges built under railway lines
