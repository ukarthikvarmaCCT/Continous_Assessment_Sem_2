 yah ek aisi vyavastha he jo ek shaktishaalee viksit raashtra yaa apekshaakrit kam shaktishaalee raashtra kaa sambandh ek aarthik yaa upgrah upnivesh ko darshaati he
 Multinational corporations are its primary means
 inkaa uddeshy aarthik rup se paradheen yaa upgrah upnivesh kaa adhik se adhik shoshan karke us par apana varchasv banaae rakhana he
 President Sukarno had said in the Bandung Conference in 1955 that it is a new veneer of colonialism in the form of economic control, intellectual control and actual physical control by a small foreign community within the nation
 uskaa spasht ishaara bahurashtriya nigamon kii badhati bhoomika kii taraf tha
 Today, developed countries are resorting to these to tighten their imperialist gripes
 inke dwaara nirdhan deshon ke kachche maal par niyantran puunji niryaat va aasaan vinimay daron ke naam par dimak kii tarah ghuskar kiya ja rahaa he taaki ve desh kachche maal kii purti tathaa taiyaar maal kii bikri kaa kendra ban jaaen
 Thus it can be said that neo-colonialism is a process of imperialist control which developed nations use to economically exploit the newly developed Least developed nations
 ye raashtra raajnneetik rup se to swatantra hote hai, lekin aarthik sahaayta, sainik sahaayta, shastron kii sahaayta, takneekee gyaan, utpaadan ke kshetra main viksit deshon ke upar hi ashrith hote hai
 Their dependence on developed countries increases so much that they do not remain independent even indirectly politically
 argenski ne upniveshwaad ke teen roopon - raajnneetik upniveshwaad, aarthik drushti se paradheen desh tathaa pichhalggu desh kaa varnan kiya he
 In the modern era, all countries have become independent politically
 isliye iskaa koi mahatv nahin rah gaya he
 He includes the last two under neo-colonialism
 ye desh raajnneetik rup se to swatantra hote hai lekin aarthik sahaayta ke liye viksit rashtron kii ore dekhte hai
 Economic backwardness is found in these countries
 logon kii nirdhantaa va asthir raajnneetik vyavasthaaen iske suchak hai
 People's personal income and national income are only nominal
 asia va africa ke navdith swatantra raashtra is shrenee main shaamil hue
 They depended on foreign aid for economic development for a long time
 unamem se adhiktar aaj bhi aarthik rup se paradheen rashtron kii shrenee main aate hai
 Developed countries have established their production units in these countries by putting more and more capital
 kai deshon main to yah nivesh 80 pratishat tak he
 These countries also have the potential to influence the political life of the dependent nations
 aise deshon ko aarthik parashrith upnivesh kaha jaataa he
 The spread of dollar imperialism policy by America in countries of Pakistan, Thailand, Ghana etc
 Asia and Africa is only a part of this type of colonialism
 yah ek aisa raashtra hota he jo aupchaarik rup se to swatantra hota he lekin raajnneetik va aarthik drushti se kisi videshi shakti ke adheen hota he
 Those countries are not able to follow independent foreign policy
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad anek deshon main soviet sangh ke niyantran vaali samyavaadee sarkarein sthapit hui
 All those countries used to fall under the category of hanger countries or satellite colonies
 aaj afghanistan main america samarthit sarkaar he
 Therefore Afghanistan is the hanger country of America
 aavashyaktaa padane par pichhalggu deshon ko anek aakaaon dwaara sainik sahaayta bhi uplabdh karai jaati he
 After the Second World War, both the superpowers helped their hanger countries in every way
 aarthik rup se parashrith deshon kii tulana main in upniveshon kii sthiti adhik kharaab hoti he
 As the Second World War approached, imperialist powers became so much weaker that they were disqualified from maintaining their imperialist control over the subjugated nations
 saath main paradheen deshon main nirantar ubhar rahi raajnneetik chetana ke parinamswaroop ubhare swatantrata aandolan ne bhi samrajyavaadee shaktiyon ko bahut haani pahunchaai
 The two world wars caused great damage to the economies of imperialist countries
 ve ab is sthiti main nahin rahe ki aandolankaaree takaton se loha le saken
 Hence they loosened their imperialist control and ended colonial rule
 lekin iske baad ek nae prakaar ke samrajyavad kaa janm hua jise nav-upniveshwaad yaa aarthik samrajyavad ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 It was an important part of the efforts made by developed imperialist countries to get their fragmented economies back on track
 samrajyavaadee takatein chaahati thi ki aarthik niyantran dwaara ve navdith swatantra rashtron ke aarthik jivan par apana niyantran ladakar unase pehle jaisaa hi laabh uthaa sakati hai
 Following are the reasons for its birth - dhire-dhire aupniveshik shoshan ke shikaar deshon main raajnneetik chetana kaa udai hua
 This led to a rapid development of the freedom movement there
 bharat jaise rashtriya mukti aandolan ne aupniveshik takaton ko yah ahsaas kara diya ki ab unka niyantran zyada din tak nahin tik saktaa
 The right to self-determination was approved in the Charter of the United Nations
 isliye samay kii najukta ko dekhakar unhen apni upniveshon ko swatantra karnaa padaa
 But the political instability of those countries gave these countries a chance to establish their economic control
 isse purana upniveshwaad nae rup main parivartit ho gaya
 The two world wars caused terrible damage to the imperialist forces of Europe
 ab upniveshon main shashan chalaanaa unke samarthy se baahar ho gaya
 The successive liberation movements also destroyed large empires
 bharat main england ko jo haani uthaani padi, usase bhaybheet hokar angrejon ne yaha par apana aupniveshik shashan jari rakhane main asamarthta jaahir kii
 The newly sovereign states began to influence international relations
 1949 main china ek samyavaadee shakti ke rup main ubhara
 Now it became difficult for the imperialist forces to remain there
 maao ne sabhi samrajyavaadee takaton ko bhayankar parinaam kii chetavanee de daali
 But not all the budding nations were as powerful as China and India
 adhiktar deshon main apane aarthik vikaas kaa samarthy nahin tha
 Therefore he expressed his desire to depend only on his old moneylenders
 sabhi samrajyavaadee takatein aarthik sahaayta ke naam par apane adheen rahe deshon main hastkshep ke prayaas karne lagi
 This gave birth to neo-colonialism there
 sabhi navdith swatantra rashtron apane aarthik vikaas ke liye videshi aarthik madad kii aavashyaktaa anubhav hui
 The imperialist countries had exploited the economic resources of most of the countries which had been victims of colonial rule for a long time
 in navdith rashtron ke paas apane aarthik vikaas ke liye na to paryaapt puunji thi or na hi takneekee gyaan, apane aarthik vikaas ke lakshya ko praapt karne ke liye in deshon ko puraani upniveshi takaton se karj lene par majaboor kar diya
 This enabled the old colonial forces to re-establish their net in these countries and new colonialism was born
 do vishwa yudhon ne samrajyavaadee takaton ko bahut zyada aarthik haani pahunchaai
 With the end of colonial rule, the sources of their raw materials and finished goods were sold
 isse samrajyavaadee deshon ko yah aavashyaktaa mahasoos hui ki navdith swatantra rashtron main mandiyon kii khoj va kachche maal ko praapt karne ke liye kya kiya jaae
 At such a time, the idea of taking advantage of the economic compulsions of the budding nations came to his mind
 isliye unhone aarthik sahaayta ke naam par in deshon main hastkshep karnaa shuru kar diya or dhire-dhire vahaan nav-upniveshvaadi shashan kii sthapana ke prayaas kiye jisase vahaan par nav-upniveshwaad kii dharna astitv main ai
 This system helped in fulfilling all the wishes of the imperial forces
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad america or soviet sangh main sheet-yuddh armbh ho gaya
 The two superpowers decided to include new nations in their groups to strengthen their positions
 videshi sahaayta, shastr purti, bahurashtriya nigamon par niyantran aadi sadhano dwaara in mahashaktiyon ne navdith swatantra rashtron ko aarthik rup se apane niyantran main le liya
 This led to an increase in the number of satellite states
 unki sabhi aarthik nitiyaan ek-ek karke nav-upniveshwaad ko majboot aadhaar pradaan karne ke liye hi thi
 Even today, developed nations like the US are strengthening their neo-colonial control through multinational corporations
 dhani va shaktishaalee samrajyavaadee raashtra apane aarthik hiton ko puraa karne ke liye navdith swatantra rashtron main apane niyantran ke alag alag tareeke apanaate hai
 Their main goal is to establish their new imperialist control over the underdeveloped countries
 iske liye unke dwaara apanaae gaye saadhan nimnlikhit hai- a network of multinational corporations has been laid by all the rich countries to control the economic and industrial units in all parts of the world
 apni aarthik shakti va kaaryakshetra main vrihata ke kaaran ye apane kshetradhikaar main aane vaale sabhi deshon main apni manamaani karne lagate hai
 Their aim is to earn maximum profit
 vikasshil deshon main ye bahurashtriya companiyaan pratyaksh puunji nivesh karke poonjivadi deshon ke liye kaccha maal tathaa praathmik utpaadan kii purti kii garanti dete hai
 They invest most in the field of primary production and raw materials
 ye jivan main moolbhoot aavashyaktaaon kii vastuon ke nivesh main sarvaadhik munafa dekhte hai
 In developing countries, there is more profit from capital investment due to cheap labor, raw materials and intensity of exploitation
 1996 main bharat main 741 videshi companiyon ne nivesh kar rakhaa tha
 Even in a developing country like India, these companies get manifold benefits
 apni puunji kii suraksha ke liye ye nigam apane niyantran vaale deshon ke aantarik maamalon main bhi hastkshep karte hai
 These companies are working to monopolize international capital trade, commerce and production and distribution abroad
 asia, africa tathaa latin america ke deshon par inkaa puraa niyantran he
 Companies like IBM, GEC and Standard Oil are reaping considerable profits from these countries
 apane munaafe kii dar ko adhik se adhik oonche str par le jane ke liye ye apane adheen rashtron ke raajnneetik hastkshep karne se bhi nahin chookte
 Thus multinational corporations are the most powerful instruments of neo-colonialism and have the full support of all developed nations
 navdith swatantra raashtra apane aarthik vikaas ke liye purna rup se videshi sahaayta va samrajyavaadee karj par hi nirbhar hai
 Under the guise of their debt and in the name of foreign aid, developed nations force these countries to accept arbitrary conditions
 inhen karj lete samay anek kathor sharten bhi manani padati he
 The debt of these countries is increasing day by day
 niryaat se praapt aay kaa adhiktar hissaa samrajyavaadee karj kaa byaaj chukaane main lag jaataa he or bhugtan santulan kaa ghaataa nirantar badhata hi jaataa he
 They have to use this loan amount to buy goods from multinational companies only
 unhen vyapaar avarodhon ko samaapt karne kii sharten bhi manani padati he
 All conditions contribute to the interests of the capital investing countries
 videshi sahaayta praapt karne vaale desh ko sadaiv niveshak yaa sahaayta pradaan karne vaale desh ke hiton main vruddhi karne ke liye apni arthvyavastha main moolbhoot parivartan karne padate hai
 Gradually, the dependence of developing countries on imperialist debt and foreign aid keeps increasing
 alp viksit yaa pichde hue deshon kii haalat to vikasshil deshon se bhi badtar hoti he
 Thus it can be said that in the race for foreign aid and imperialist debt, developed countries are nurturing neo-colonialism
 aaj ke aanvik yug main prayek raashtra apane ko sainik va samrik drushti se surakshit dekhnaa chahta he
 For this, they have to buy weapons from developed countries
 aarthik rup se kamjor hone ke kaaran ye desh kai baar karja bhi lete hai
 Today most of the national income of developing countries is being spent on purchasing arms
 mahashaktiyon dwaara kiya jane vaala shakti pradarshan shastr pratispardhaa ko badhaava detaa he
 In 1979, the confrontation of the superpowers reached abroad and brought substantial benefits
 in mahashaktiyon dwaara dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad kiye gaye shakti pradarshan inke shastr udyog main ai mandi ko kam karne main sahaayak siddh hue
 Today, most countries of the third world buy arms only from America, France, Britain and Soviet Union
 apni aupniveshik sthiti ko majboot banane ke liye samrajyavaadee deshon ne teesri duniya ke deshon main apane sainik adde khol rakhe hai
 These countries are promoting neo-colonialism as a supply of weapons
 aaj vishwa bank, antarrashtriya mudra kosh jaisi antarrashtriya sansthaaen antarrashtriya arthvyavastha kaa sanchaalan kar rahi hai
 These institutions nurture neo-colonialism by imposing strict conditions while giving loans
 deshon ko diya jane vaala rin hameshaa raajnneetik pratibandhon par aadhaarit hota he
 It is always responsible for the interests of developed nations
 isiilie tritiy vishwa ke desh nai antarrashtriya arthvyavastha kii purajor maang karte rahete hai
 They allege that the world's economic institutions are going to nurture imperialist interests
 ye nirantar pichde hue yaa vikasshil deshon ke aarthik va raajnneetik hiton par kutharaghaat karti hai
 In this way they are promoting a new form of colonialism
 samrajyavaadee shaktiyaan aarthik sahaayta dekar pichde rashtron ko nirantar kamjor karti rahati he
 The total interference of the imperialist or investing country in its economic and political life increases
 videshi takat ashrith desh ke vyapaar par apana purna niyantran rakhti he to unka niyantran dhire-dhire sthaayee rup praapt kar letaa he or yah nirbharta nirantar badhati hi rahati he or vah ant main upgrahi rajya kaa rup le letaa he
 Now the imperialist power shifts its attention towards the political sector rather than the economic sector
 isse upgrahi raashtra ko apane aakaa kii har baat maanane ke liye baadhya hona padataa he
 Prior to 1990, the Soviet Union had openly used this type of policy
 iske peeche nav-upniveshwaad ke prasar kii hi bhaavana vidyaman rahati he
 Thus, it can be said that even today, in the form of neo-colonialism, developed nations continue to dominate the underdeveloped and developing countries
 dakshin ke garib desh nirantar nav-upniveshwaad ke shoshan kaa shikaar ho rahe hai
 Developed countries of the north are strengthening their hold on these countries through multinational corporations and international economic institutions
 bahurashtriya companiyaan vikasshil va pichde deshon main dimak kii tarah ghus rahi hai
 It is also able to influence political behavior in most countries
 apane hiton kii purti ke liye viksit raashtra saanskrithik samrajyavad kaa bhi sahaara le rahe hai
 After the end of the Cold War, the United States is rapidly developing its economic or dollar imperialism in the world
 vah aarthik jivan ke saath-saath vikasshil va pichde tritiy vishwa ke deshon ke raajnneetik kriya-kalapon main bhi hastkshep karne laga he
 If its emerging neo-colonialism is not stopped, a new threat will arise for the whole world
 aaj tritiy vishwa ke deshon ko ekajute hokar nav-upniveshwaad kii jaden ukhaadne kii jarurat he taaki nai antarrashtriya arthvyavastha kii sthapana ho sake

 The Moon is a differentiated body with a three-part crust, mantle and core

 Other proposed circumstances include capture bodies, fragmentation, aggregating together, planetary collisions, and collision theory

 The collision also produced a 23

 chandramaa ke oxigen samasthanik anupaat prithvi ke liye anivaary rup se samaan dikhte hai
 The oxygen isotopic ratio, which can be measured very precisely, produces a unique and distinct signature for each solar system body
 agar thia ek alag protoplanet tha, to shaayad prithvi se ek alag oxigen isotope hastakshar hota, jaisaa ki alag-alag mishrit padaarth hota
 In addition, the titanium isotope ratio of the Moon appears to be closer to that of the Earth, if at least any colliding body mass may be part of the Moon

 The balance of such mutual transactions between different countries is called balance of payments
 yon kahana chahie ki kisi nishchit tithi ko ek desh dwaara anya deshon ko chukaai janevaali sakal raashi tathaa anya deshon se use praapt honevaali sakal raashi ke antar ko us desh kaa 'bhugtan shesh' kehete hai
 The right and opportunity for any one country to receive payment from other countries comes when that country exports goods to those countries, or provides its services by its ships, banks, insurance companies and skilled experts or in the trade of industries of those countries

 aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki us desh ke dwaara anya deshon ko die gaye rinon kii mulrashi kaa use bhugtan praapt hota ho yaa anya deshon se hi use rin swaroop raashi milti ho
 Apart from this, it is also possible that country tourists from other countries come to that country to buy goods or consume services
 in sabhi paristhitiyon main us desh ko anya deshon se bhugtan praapt karne kaa avasar hoga
 On the contrary, it is possible that the same country has to repay some of the payment of other countries
 is prakaar kisi ek tithi ko in sabhi madon par ek desh kii safal lendaree kaa antar nikaalane se us desh kaa bhugtan shesh gyaat ho jaayga
 Although this type of transaction between countries keeps going on some item continuously, but if the difference of transactions of different countries of a country is determined on a certain date, then one of the following circumstances definitely arises
 : is prakaar bhugtan shesh 'anukool', 'pratikul' va 'santulit' yaa 'paksh' main, 'vipaksh' main or 'baraabar' kaha jaataa he
 But its relationship with a particular country should be expressed in a relative sense
 yah kahana sarthak nahin ki bhugtan shesh anukool, pratikul va santulit he; varan yah kahana hoga ki amuk tithi ko yaa amuk avadhi main amuk desh kaa bhugtan shesh uske anukool he, pratikul he athwa santulit he
 In extracting the balance of payments, not only the excess of import and export of goods is known as 'trade balance' but also the difference of gross liability and gross liability from all the items mentioned above
 len dein ke nirantar kram main bhugtan shesh anivaaryat: santulit ho jaataa he par kisi thithivishesh ko kisi desh kaa bhugtan shesh uske anukool yaa pratikul hi paaya jaataa he
 The remaining favorable and favorable payment of a country is considered to reflect the internal economic situation of that country
 yadi bhugtan shesh anukool rahaa to iskaa arth hoga us desh dwaara niryaat kaa bahulya, utpaadan kii prachurtaa, udyog vyapaar kii sabalata, videshi mudra kii kamai or raashtra ke swarnakosh main vruddhi
 Conversely, adverse balance of payments will mean the multiplicity of imports, the laxity of the trade industry, the decline in production, the lack of appropriation, the depletion of foreign exchange and the gold reserves of the nation

 bharat evam videshon main rah rahe itihaas evam puraatatva ke vidvan, vishvavidhyalayon main karyrat praadhyaapak, adhyaaapak, anusandhan-kendron ke sanchaalak, bhugol, khagol, bhaautishastra aadi anek kshetron ke vidvan tathaa vaigyanik evam itihaas main ruchi rakhanevaale vidwaan is kaary se jude hue hai
 The motto of the scheme is - Namoolam Likhyate Kichchit
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke pratham prachaarak shri baba sahib apate ne itihaas main samyak drushti evam satyaapan ke liye bada kaary kiya
 His ideas could not be embodied in his lifetime
 unke dehant ke baad san 1973 main shri moreshwar nilkanth pingale kii prerana se nagpur main ‘baba sahib apate smarak samiti’ kii sthapana hui
 Initially, this committee took up two tasks in its hands - prarambh main chaar varshon tak itihaas-punarlekhan ke kaary ke sambandh main desh ke itihaaskaaron se vichaar-vimarsh chalata rahaa
 Finally it was decided by consensus that the work of rewriting and compilation of history should be done in the name of 'all India history-compilation Scheme'
 tatpashchaat 1980 se yah kaary vidhiwat prarambh hua
 The registration of the scheme in the name of 'all India history-collection Scheme' was held in Delhi on 24 May 1994 AD, according to Vaishakh Shukla Purnima, Tuesday, Kaliyugabd 5096
 san 1995 main sanskrit ke prachaar-prasar ke kaary ko yojana se alag karke ‘sanskrit bharti’ ko saunp diya gaya
 Due to the registration of All India history-collection Scheme in Delhi and due to the all-round importance of Delhi, its headquarters was established in 'keshav-kunj' Jhandewala
 yojana kaa kaary badhane ke saath hi or adhik sthaan kii aavashyaktaa hui
 Therefore, 'babasaheb Apte Smriti Bhawan' was constructed in the 'keshava-kunj' complex
 armbh se hi rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa mat rahaa he ki bhartiya-itihaas-lekhan kaa jo kaary angrajon ke netritv main prarambh hua or vaigyanik, vastuparak shodh ke naam par jise bhartiya-itihaaskaaron ne bhi apanaaya, vah anek sthalon par purvaagrah se prerit, tathyon ke agyaan athwa jaan-boojhkar kii gai upeksha par aadhaarit he jiske kaaran bhartiya-itihaas main anek visangatiyaan evam bhram utpann ho gaye hai
 In the backdrop of the above ideas, the objective of the All India history-compilation Scheme is to recalibrate the history from the beginning of creation to the present time on the basis of the Indian census
 yah punarsankalan satya, sahi, nishpaksh tathyon par aadhaarit, kisi bhi prakaar ke purvaagrah se rahit, aadhunik vaigyanik-anusandhanon or naveenatam puratetvik khojon ke aadhaar par hoga
 The major points of the objective of the scheme are as follows: akhil bhartiya itihaas-sankalan yojana ke mukhya prakalp nimnlikhit hai- The measure of resistance to change of rotation rate of a body is called inertia of that body
 kisi pind kaa jadtwaghurna uske aakaar-prakaar evam uske andar dravyaman ke vitaran kii prakruti par nirbhar karata he
 The work of mass in the transfer speed is the same inertial in the rotation speed
 jadtwaghurna ke pratik ke liye i yaa kabhi-kabhi j kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The concept of inertia was first mentioned by Euler in his book 'theoria motus corporum solidorum seu rigidorum' in 1730
 kisi sthir aksh ke paritah kanon ke kisi nikaay kaa jadtwaghurna Ja, un sabhi kanon ke dravyaman tathaa unki aksh se duuri ke varg ke gunanfalon ke yoga ke baraabar hota he

 In this regard, the following arrangements are- isai dharamshastra main dharmik siddhanton yaa vishwaason ke samarthan main likhe gaye nibandhon ko samuhik rup main aapattikhandan kaa naam diya gaya
 The word is derived from the Greek 'apologeticos' which means 'thing worthy of support'
 united kingdom main is prakaar ke dharmik sahitya ko 'avidenses ov relijan' bhi kehete hai, parantu adhiktar isai deshon main apollogytics shabd hi saamanyat: prachlit he
 Although the advocacy of the apocalyptic part of any religion falls in the field of 'apologetics', but in the religious literature tradition this term has been used only in support of Catholic principles

 Even after this, such articles were written for centuries, but they are not special

 Among the historical books in which detailed description of 'apologetics' is available, the treatise of Eusebius 'history of the Christian Church' is particularly notable

 Diplomatic recognition is a political act, by which one nation recognizes, of another state, or of any action of its government, or of the condition by which the truth or truth is proved, and its intention is revealed, that recognition On the domestic and international legal conclusions of
 manyata vaastavik yaa vidhitah, saamanytah manyata dene vaali sarkaar ke ek kathan dwaara di ja sakati he
 Giving recognition to a state refers to the act by which a state recognizes that the political existence of the state that has given its recognition has the qualities of kingship
 isame antarrashtriya parivaar kaa koi vartmaan sadsy kisi rajya athwa kisi raajnneetik dal ko vidhiwat apni sweekruti pradaan karata he
 This means that by the opinion of the state granting the recognition, the said state is the general officer of international rights and duties and has the ability to bear the obligations received in accordance with international legislation
 rajya manyata ke do pariklp yaa siddhant hai-1
 sanghatana-nirbhar pariklp or 2
 ghoshnaatmak athwa ghoshnaatmak pariklp
 According to the Sanghatana-dependent hypothesis, any state becomes an international state only through recognition
 arthath keval manyata ke kaary dwaara hi kisi rajya ko rajyatv mil jaataa he or vahaan kii nai sarkaar ko antarrashtriya kshetra main adhikaar praapt ho jaataa he
 Hegel was the first lecturer of this concept
 tadnantar holland, openhim tathaa anya logon ne uskaa samarthan kiya
 According to the second hypothesis, any state, without its authority, attains international office and membership of the family
 rajyamanyata kaa kaary is sthapit satya kii pushti kii vidhiwat manyatamaatr he
 Hall, Fisher, Brearley and others are lecturers of this concept
 in donon maton main se uchit mat yah prathit hota he ki rajyamanyata sanghatana-nirbhar bhi he or ghoshnaatmak bhi
 According to different fact groups, the first hypothesis may apply to someone, the second to another
 kisi raajnneetik samudaay kaa astitv he, is saamaanya tathy kii ghoshnaa maatr karnaa hi rajyamanyata he
 Due to such a declaration of statehood, certain statutory conditions arise due to recognition
 lenterpash or stark jaise aaj ke adhikansh lekhak is mat kaa pratipaadan karte hai
 Whether or not to grant recognition depends on the will of the states
 par yah ichha manamaani nahin honi chahie
 According to legal principles, statehood should be granted or not
 haan, yah avashya he ki raajnneetik or kootnithik vichaarsarani rajyamanyata kii sweekruti yaa asweekruti par apana prabhaav daalati hi he
 Validation can be of two types - either explicit or implied
 spasht manyata us samay hoti he jab manyata kaa vichaar prakat karne ke liye vidhiwat koi vijyapti nikaali jaati he yaa ghoshnaa kii jaati he
 For example, writing a letter to that state or to a government that has prayed for recognition
 sanketit manyata vah he jahaan spasht rup se to manyata prakat nahin kii jaati, parantu apane kaaryon se yah baat prakat kar di jaati he ki manyata kii sweekruti asandigdh he; jaise, do rajyon ke bich vyapaarik sandhi ho janaa athwa donon rajyon ke bich vidhiwat duutavasiya sambandh sthapit kar lenaa
 Legal recognition means that according to the state of recognition, the state or government to which it is accredited duly fulfills the requirements laid down in international legislation for active participation in the international community
 vaastavik manyata kaa arth yah he ki manyata denevaale rajya ke matanusaar jis rajya ko athwa jis sarkaar ko manyata pradaan kii gai he, vah asthaayee rup se alp kaal ke liye un aavashyaktaaon kii vastut: purti karata he, yadhyapi sari aavashyaktaayen upasthit nahin he or ukt rajya abhi paryaapt dridhtaa praapt nahin kar sakaa he
 Actual recognition is short-lived and can be returned at a time when those requirements, which must be fulfilled for validation, are not met even in bad
 vidhik manyata antim evam sthaayee hoti he or ek baar de dene ke baad vah lautaai nahin ja sakati
 In many cases it has been accepted that as far as its legal consequences are concerned, there is no difference between actual recognition and legal recognition
 jab antarrashtriya vishistatv praapt kisi rajya ke adhyaksh pad main saamaanya or vaidhanik paddati se parivartan hota he, to anya rajyon ko isaki soochna de di jaati he
 Those states give their recognition to the new president of the said state by sending a message of congratulations on their behalf
 isamen kathinaayee tabhi hoti he jab kranti ke dwaara adhyaksh ke pad main athwa sarkaar main parivartan hota he
 In such cases, two types of tests are used: The first test is whether the new government is the real government, it is the real government, which has effective control over the state and whether it is dominating the substantial area of the state
 And it has no effective opposing side
 yah bahya vishyak pareekshan kehalaata he
 The second test is whether the new government is able to fulfill the obligations that are prescribed by international legislation and by the authority of the League of Nations? This is called internal or thematic testing
 jin rajyon se nae rajya athwa sarkaar ko manyata pradaan karne ke liye kaha jaataa he, ve aise maamalon main vahiin apana nirnay sthagit rakhte hai jahaan sarkaar sthaayee nahin hoti athwa jahaan praaia: hi krantiyaan hoti rahati hai jinke kaaran sarkaar badalati rahati hai
 But the recognition of the state itself has no relation with the recognition or not of any government
 rajya ko to antarrashtriya ikai ke rup main manyata praapt hi rahati he
 According to the practice prevailing in many countries, the recognition given to the states has a retrospective effect and the courts are valid in accepting all the actions of a new state or new government which have been done by the new government since its inception
 manyata ke parinaam - kisi nae rajya athwa nai sarkaar ko manyata milane se nimnlikhit mukhya parinaam hote hai : After obtaining recognition - The said state or the government gets the ability to enter into a treaty or establish diplomatic relations with the states that provide the recognition
 manyataprapt ukt rajya ko yah adhikaar praapt ho jaataa he ki yah manyata denevaale rajyon ke nyaayalayon main mukadmaa daayar kar sake
 The jurisdiction of the courts of the states granting recognition to the recognized state is granted immunity or exemption in respect of itself and in relation to its property
 manyataprapt rajya ko yah adhikaar bhi praapt ho jaataa he ki manyata denevaale kisi rajya ke seemakshetra main yadi uski purvavarti sarkaar kii koi sampatti rahi ho to vah uski maang kar use adhigruhit kar sake
 If civil war breaks out in a country, rebels can be declared warring if certain conditions are met, such as- vyapak shatrukaarya ke saath grihayuddh
 To establish the suzerainty over the territory of the national frontier by the seditious and to maintain orderly governance over it
 rajyadrohiyon dwaara kisi uttaradaayi satta ke adheen yuddh ke niyamon kaa paalan karnaa
 For other-third-states, the practical need to explain their stand in relation to civil war arises
 yadi aisi sthiti ho ki inamen se keval thodi si hi sharten puri hoti hon to anya rajya vidrohiyon ko rajyadrohi kii manyata pradaan kar sakate hai or unhen kanoon-bhang-karta na maanakar us kshetra kaa vaastavik adhikari maan sakate hai jahaan unka adhikaar sthapit ho gaya ho
 Thus, if a state recognizes a state, it cannot withdraw its recognition for any political purpose
 parantu kuch vishesh paristhitiyon main manyata waapas lee ja sakati he
 For example, if a state loses its independence, or its government becomes ineffective, or if a militant party is defeated in a civil war, the state's recognition can be withdrawn

 He could not kill Harry with his current wand because the axes of his and Harry's wand were the same, so after Lucius Melfoy failed to kill Harry with a stick, he would search for the world's most powerful stick Elder wand

 Rolling reveals in Harry Potter and the half-blood Prince that the young Meroopi Gaunt made every effort to get close to Tom Riddle, keeping an eye on him from the windows and bushes at every opportunity
 moffin ne apni bahan kaa tom ke prati prem ko bhaap liya tha or us par jaadu kaa prayog karne laga
 It was a violation of the rules of witchcraft that led to a fierce battle with the Ministry of Magic and after this Moffin and his father Marvolo were imprisoned in Azkaban

 and became pregnant only three months later
 pehle usne tom ko prem kadha dekar use apane prem main vasheebhoot kiya parantu jab vah garbhvatee hui to usne kadha dena band kar diya
 She stopped brewing with this hope because she did not want to live her untrue life any longer and she also wanted her husband Tom to love her genuinely, as well as hope that her husband at least Will stop being in love with your unborn child
 lekin aisa nahin hota he or tom sachai pataa lagate hi use chhod kar chalaa jaataa he
 Frustrated with all these developments, Meropi starts wandering the streets of London

 He believed that his parents' proximity to the Magalas was not right for Isolt
 krur or kattar garmaleith ne islot ko magaluon se alag-thalag karne ke liye uske upar kaale jaadu kaa istemaal kiya, use chadi kaa istemaal nahin karne diya, hoguarts main daakhila bhi nahin lene diya, jaisaa ki usne khud kiya tha
 After living with her for 12 years, Islot stole Garmlath's wand and she fled to the American colony and moved to Massachusetts
 vahaan par usne ilvermorni jaadu tona or tantra mantra vidhyalay main daakhila le liya
 When Gormlath finds out this, she follows her niece to Massachusetts where she is murdered by Islot's friend

 uske andar chetana kaa abhaav tha, vah apane kiye par use koi pachhtaawaa nahin hota tha tathaa vah apane atirikt insaaniyat kaa mahatva bhi nahin samajhataa tha

 Rolling states the difference between Voldemort and Harry, stating that Harry had accepted death, for this reason he eventually emerged stronger than he was
 puri shrunkhlaa main rolling ne voldemort ko atyadhik shaktishaalee, budhimaan or nirmam dusht jaadugar bataaya he

 parantu voldemort main yah vilakshan pratibha tathaa kaushal hote hue bhi vah pyaar jaise shaktishaalee jaadu kaa saamana karne main ayogy tha; is samay koi shaktiyaan kaam nahin karti thi

 Self Portrait, 1985 anil karanjay ek purna bhartiya kalakaar the
 Born in East Bengal, Karanjaya was educated in Benaras, where his family settled in 1947 after the partition of the Indian subcontinent
 ek chote bachche ke rup main ve mitti ke saath khilne, khilone or tir banane main kaaphi samay bitaate the
 He very soon started drawing animals and plants or drawing anything that inspired him
 1956 main unhone bengal skool ke ek guru or nepali mul ke karanman singh kii adhyakshata vaale bhartiya kala kendra kaa purnakalik chaatr banane ke liye skool chhod diya
 is shikshak ne anil ko vyapak rup se prayog karne or har samskruti kii kala kaa adhyayanke liye protsaahit kiya
 Anil stayed here till 1960, during which he continued to perform regularly and teach other students
 During the same period he practiced miniature painting under the supervision of the last court painter of the Maharaja of Benares at Bharat Kala Bhavan
 unhone clay modelling or dhaatu kii dhalaai seekhney ke liye banaras politechnic main bhi daakhila liya
 During the revolutionary 1960s, Anil was at the forefront of the Indian and international political-cultural movement
 1962 main, karunanidhan mukhopadhyaay ke saath unhone sanyukt kalakaaron kii sthapana kii
 unke studio ke naam 'shaitan kii kaaryshaala' ne puure bharat or videshon ke kalakaaron, lekhakon, kaviyon or sangeetkaaron ko aakarshith kiya
 The group set up Benaras' first art gallery in Paradise Cafe, a non-stop tea shop where frequent visitors to some of the most colorful personalities in this vibrant city
 anil or samooh ke anya log is dauraan ek samudaay main rahete the or anek deshon ke 'anveshakon' se vichaar-vimarsh or anubhav kaa vinimay kiya
 Anil Karanjaya was a very active member of the Hungry Generation, a famous radical Bengali group of poets, also known as the Hungryalist वादीাংরি আন্দোলন movement
 jab alan ginsburg or peter orlevoski ne apane bharat pravaas ke dauraan bhukhwaadiyon se baatcheet kii us samay anil beet janareshan se jude the
 The Hungryalists were based in Patna, Kolkata and Banaras and they also forged important contacts with the avant garde in Nepal
 Anil made many illustrations for Hungryalist publications
 He also contributed posters and poems
 And he was a founder of the small magazine movement in India
 1969 main, ve nai dilli chale gaye jahaan unhone dilli shilpi chakra main ek 'laghu patrika pradarshnee' yojit kii or usamen bhaag liya
 In the first half of the 70s, Anil Karanjay made a huge impact in Indian art circles with his technical maturity and his dreamlike, often terrifying, angry imagery
 In most of his early paintings, he used strange scenarios - rage and accusations; Creating distorted human forms emerging from natural forms - rocks, clouds, animals and trees - became a vehicle for mass consciousness, releasing its energy against centuries of oppression
 apane dilli jane ke baad, itihaas ke atyaachaar ke liye ek roopak kii tarah, unke vikrut maanav roopon ko aksar khandhar ke saath ekikrut kiya gaya
 But an element of sarcastic humor is not absent in most of these canvases
 iske alaava, anil kii kalpana kabhi-kabhi ek kaavyatmak romansawad, lagbhag komal abhivyakti se sampark karti he
 This became more evident in most of his later works in which the landscape serves as the dominant motif and is only a sign of human presence, often by a path or stairs leading to a mysterious destination
 unke paridrishy main puraani deevaaron, dwaar yaa murtikla yukt khambhon ke madhyam se bhutiya fusfusaahat bhi goonjati he
 He won a National Award in 1972, but it had a minor impact on his life
 He was a particularly anti-establishment artist and would remain so for the rest of his life
 The intense collective spirit and achievements of the 1960s had a profound impact on Anil
 uske baad se ve aksar rachanaatmak rup se alag mahasoos rahane lage
 ek raajnneetik saanskrithik kaaryakarta ke rup main ve hameshaa patibaddh rahenge or vah bhukhi peedi ke malay raay choudhary, subimal basaa, samir roychoudhary, tridiv mitra or us yug ke anya duusare lekhakon se rishta banaae rakhenge
 lekin ek kalakaar ke rup main ve khud ko apane samakalinon se ek antar par pate rahe
 samay ke saath, unka vichaar abhivyakti ke us tareeke ke prati adhik jhukaav rahaa jise kala pratishthanon or bharat ke ek vaishvik arthvyavastha ban jane se upje nae samrudh kala sangraahakon dwaara fishan ke baahar mana jaataa he
 This was especially true of his last decade when the pure landscape became the vehicle of his theory of communication
 haalanki abhi tak unke akele paridrishyon se log kabhi bhi bahut dur nahin rahe hai
 In fact, their trees and other natural elements are embellished by strange human gestures
 kabhi-kabhi puri prakruti ek chhipe dushman ke khilaaf shadyantr karti prathit hoti he, jo ek paryaavaran kaaryakarta ke rup main anil kii gahari chintaa ko darshaati he
 But it is not only his subjects that earned him neglect and disrespect among the powerful groups that decide the artists' worldly success or failure
 yatharthwaad ne bhi isamen apni bhoomika nibhaai jo unke baad ke kaaryon kii visheshta thi
 These appear almost classical on the surface, yet to those who appreciate them, they are an expression of a higher realism that resonates throughout our contemporary period
 khud anil ne apane kaam kii tulana ek 'jaadui yatharthwaad' ke saath kii he
 As he said in a film on him, The Nature of Art, "my paintings are a dream, a dream of nature
" The emotional content of the paintings was of supreme importance
 isamen anil bhartiya shastreey sangeet, vishesh rup se raag ke bare main, ke apane vishaal gyaan se chitra banaate hai jisamen ek rachana ek samay yaa ek mausam kii manodasha yaa bhaavana ko vyakt karti he
 In art, its equivalent is called rasa, virtually rasa or essence, an aesthetic approach that Anil considered timeless and universal and sought to explain it in his paintings
 apane paripakv charan main, kala ke bare main anil ke darshan main ek pramukh parivartan aayaa
 While his early works can be described as ideologically confrontational, his later work was conceived and executed to relieve the viewer
 ve khud ko, ek doctor ke sadrush, ek kushal peshewar ke rup main dekhte the
 As he said on many occasions including that film: "the role of today's artist is to heal the wounds inflicted by our society
 " Throughout his career, Anil worked with various mediums, especially oily colors, which he considered highly outstanding
 lekin antim varshon main unhone apane anek behtareen chitron ko sabhi sookhe pastalon ke upar pastel creyon se puraa kiya
 It is a medium in which he has perhaps shown more mastery and research than any other Indian artist of his time
 apane antim dashakon main, anil bhi ek safal chitrakaar ban gaye
 He made many paintings as a means of survival, but his best work in this genre is mostly on those who are close to him
 ateet ke ustaadon kii parampara kaa anusaran karte hue, unhone anek aatm-chitra banaae
 inamen se kuch unke sabase gahan abhivyakti vaale kaaryon main shaamil hai
