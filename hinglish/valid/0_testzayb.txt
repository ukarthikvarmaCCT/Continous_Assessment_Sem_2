 The land of Greece has been very fertile for philosophy
 bahut se vidwaan maanate hai ki unani darshan ne sampoorn paashchaatya chintan par amit chhap choda he
 Greek philosophy is divided into three parts
 pehla bhaag un logon ke vichaar hai jo unani the, parantu yunaan ke baahar unani bastiyon main rahete the
 Athens became the capital of philosophy with the thinkers of the Sophist sect and Socrates
 sucraat, plato or arestu ne unani darshan ko isaki praudhata pradaan kii or pashchimi vichaardhaara par na mitanevaali chhap laga di
 After Aristotle, ancient philosophy began to roll downwards
 swatantra vichaaron ke sthaan main, plato or arestu kii vyavastha hi vivechan kaa lakshya ban gai
 Greek philosophy was born in Ionia
 thels enexymander or aneximiniz ne sristi ke mul tatv ke vishay main apane vichaar prakat kiye
 All three had the same belief that the basic element is one and is physical
 thels ne jal ko, eneccemender ne avyakt prakruti ko or aneciminiz ne vaayu ko mul tatv kaa pad diya
 Properties and quantities are visible in every physical substance
 ionia ke vichaarkon ne gun par dhyaan diya or maatra kii upeksha kii
 Pythagarus considered quantity to be an element of power
 maatra kii jaanch ikai kii neenv par hoti he or yah sankhya kaa aadhaar he
 According to Pythagoras the number is the element of power
 is tarah usne amoort ko darshanik vivechan main pravisht kar diya
 According to Pythagoras, conformity and harmony are seen everywhere in the world
 yah anurupata gayan main prasiddh hoti he, sankhya kii tulyata raag kii jaan he
 The constellations produce a sweet sound in their motion, though we cannot hear it, because its intensity does not fall within the limits of our hearing
 sucraat se parv ke darshan main ek mahatvapurn vivaad parmenidis or hireclitas ne prastut kar diya
 Parmenidis also ignored quantity like virtue and saw power or "sat" itself as the basic element
 yah "sat" ekares nirpeksh he, isamen koi pavirthan nahin hota, yah anant he, avibhajya he, desh or kaal se asambaddha he
 "asat" lacks all these qualities
 udbhav "sat" or "asat" kaa mail he
 Hireclites did not say that change is an element of power, nothing but the emergence of power
 in donon vichaarkon ne "sat" or "prakaashan" ke pratyayon ko darshanik vivechan main kendriya prashn bana diya
 In opposition to Hiraclitus 'flowism, Parmenidis' disciple Gino sought to explain that there is no possibility of movement or change, the arrow is situated at some point per moment, and cannot be at two points simultaneously
 pracheen dasharn ke pratham yug main do or naamon kaa mahatv he
 Dimacritus stated that the properties of substances depend on the magnitude, size and location of the atoms of which substances are formed by chance
 ek tarah se, demacraitis kaa parmanuwaad sadwad or pravaahvaad kaa samanvay tha : parmaanu sat hai, unke sanyog se pravaah vyakt haata he
 Anaxagoras said that unconscious nature cannot solve the system of creation; This solution requires consciousness
 sristi vivechan main chetana kaa anisht hona ek mahatvapurn parivartan tha
 Aristotle said at the back that Annexagoras was careful among drunk people
 unani darshan ke pratham bhaag ne nimnaankit pratyayon ko vichaarkon ke sammukh rakh diya- 1
 Basic elements of creation, 2
 Truth and origin, power and revelation 3
 Place of consciousness in creation spasht he ki uttarkalin vivechan inamen se kisi pratyay kii upeksha nahin kar sakaa
 Greek philosophy arrived in Athens with the Safist community and Socrates
 abhi tak darshan tatvagyan ke arth main samajha jaataa tha, ab niti or gyanamimasaa bhi uske saath mil gai
 In relation to both, there was a fundamental distinction between the views of the Safist thinkers and Socrates
 protagores ne kaha ki manushya sabhi vastuon kaa maapak he
 The same is true for every human being, which is known to him by the senses, for each he is auspicious
 sucraat ne kaha ki is varnan ke anusaar to satya or shubh kaa astitv hi nahin rahata
 If each person says only about his perception and his choice, then there can be no difference of opinion between two human beings regarding truth and auspiciousness
 sucraat ne kaha king satya or shubh sab ke liye ek hi hai
 This controversy inserted the suffixes of general and special in philosophical discourse
 niti ke sambandhan main sucraat ne kaha ki gyaan or sachharitrataa ek hi vastu hai
 This does not mean that no karma is auspicious, unless the doer has knowledge of its auspiciousness, but also that it becomes mandatory for a person to do that karma
 bura karm prayek avasthaa main agyanjanit karm hota he
 Socrates wanted to accurately characterize moral affixes and used Advent for this
 darshanashastra ke liye sucraat kii sabase badi dein yah thi ki usne plato or arestu ke kaam ko sambhav bana diya
 Both walked on the path suggested by Socrates, and through them all the subsequent deliberations marked the thoughts of Socrates
 pracheen pashchimi darshan main plato kaa sthaan shikhar par he
 In addition to Socrates, the ideas of Parthenidis and Hiraclitus also participated in deconstructing Plato's view
 sucraat ke prabhaav main usne pratyayon kaa mahatv samajha or unhen parmenidis kii satta kaa pad diya
 He saw the vision world as the emergence of Hireclitus
 antim satta saamaanya yaa pratyayon kii he, vishesh padaarth kisi pratyay kii apurna nakal hote hai
 This is the famous suffix theory of Plato
 in pratyayon main moulik or pramukh pratyay shrey yaa shubh kaa pratyay he
 In deciding the nature of correctness in policy, Plato considered a person a small model of society
 vyakti kii shubh bhavanaayen samaaj kii aavashyaktaaon ke anukool hai
 He gave prudence, courage, restraint and justice to the rank of main goodwill
 nyaay kaa arth yahi tha ki anya teen vrittiyaan apane apane kshetra main rahe or jivan main saamanjasy bana rahe
 In Jnanamimamsa, he placed knowledge on three levels
 sabase nichle str par vishesh vastuon kaa gyaan he
 Such knowledge has the effect of the condition of the objects, the medium and the occasional state of the knower
 yah nahin kah sakate ki kisi vishesh padaarth ko dekhanevaale use ek hi rup main dekhte hai
 Plato gives such knowledge the title of consent
 jo gyaan ganit se praapt hota he vah vishesh padaarth ke gyaan se unche str par he
 We take a particular triangle, but what we prove is valid for all triangles
 vahaan vishesh saamaanya k pratinidhitiv karata he
 Philosophical deliberation is at the highest level, in this only matter is a matter of general thought
 yatharth main yahi bodh gyaan kahalaane kaa adhikari he
 Plato applied his suffix theory to various aspects of power and life in his dialogues
 in sanvaadon main "republic" pramukh he
 In some critics, in other dialogues we see Plato on one side, all of Plato in "republic"
 plato ne vishwa kaa vyapak alokan prastut karne kaa ytn kiya
 Gyanendris cannot say anything in this regard
 jo kuch ye bataati hai, uske prati plato kaa bhav anadar kaa tha
 Aristotle's nature was different from this, he was essentially scientific
 vaigyanik ke liye vishesh kaa mahatv hota he or vah use jaanane ke liye indriyadutt bodh kaa aashray letaa he
 Aristotle started with "justice"; Wrote on physics, policy, politics and art and finally wrote an incomplete treatise on philosophy
 tatvagyan main platon ke prayek siddhant kii kadi aalochana kii
 Plato stated that all particular substances in a category are incomplete imitations of the same general or suffix
 nakalen hongi, parantu ye drusht jagat main aa kaise gai
 Suffixes do not change, they cannot make complete or incomplete copies
 yadi nakalen kisi prakaar ban bhi gai, to achal jagat hi vidyaman hoga- gati yaa parivartan rahasy hi bane rahete hai
 Plato said that the specials of the general category differ and that is why the specials of one category are different from the specials of another category
 arestu ne vyakti ko vishesh mahatv diya
 Person is a combination of material and shape
 aarambhik saamagree avyakt prakruti thi, isamen kisi prakaar kii akruti na thi
 In development, the shape gives the material its special form
 padaarthon main oonch neech kaa bhed isi baat par nirbhar karata he ki akruti saamagree ko kis seemaa tak prabhavit kar saki he
 Everything in the world is moving forward, is not pushed backwards, is getting attracted from the front
 aakarshak shakti vishuddh akruti he, jise arestu paramatma kaa naam detaa he
 In policy, Aristotle did not consider fundamental goodwill like Plato, he sought to designate the nature of common goodwill
 vah is nishkarsh par pahunchaa ki shubh yaa bhadra do charam simaaon main madhyavarti sthiti he
 Both disgust and cowardice are demerits; There is courage in their midst which is virtuous
 shishtachar uddandata or dasabhaav ke bich kii avasthaa he
 With this solution, the difference between auspicious and inauspicious becomes a difference of quantity
 darshanikon main praaia: ise gunatmak bhed samajha jaataa he
 Good and evil are different things
 sucraat ne pratyayon kii paribhaasha par bal diya tha
 Aristotle created incorporation justice, and incorporation with little distinction is still Aristotle's incorporation justice
 anumaan main pramukh baat pramanikta he
 We have to see what conclusion we get when we accept the answer and we are hindered
 vaakyon main koi vaakya jisamen aantarik virodh ho, anivaary rup main amaanya ho jaataa he
 In philosophy, Aristotle's principal gift is the suffix of matter
 yon to usne satta ke 10 antim pakshon kaa varnan kiya he, paratu vastav main ve dravya or uske gun hi hai
 As we shall see, the suffix of matter remained the central suffix of thought throughout the philosophical discourse
 kranti vir singh The age of maturity of ancient philosophy ends with Aristotle
 uski mrityu ke kuch hi varshon baad, zino or epicuras ne lagbhag ek saath do nai vichaardhaaraon kii neenv rakhi
 Both views have three parts of justice, physics and ethics
 nyaay main donon arestu ke anuyaayi the
 In the Prakrit world both accepted unhindered rule
 donon kaa aitihaasik mahatv niti ke sambadh main he
 The main topic of controversy is the state of indulgence or satiety
 apicuras ke anusaar yah tripti hi jivan main ekmaatr mulya he
 The term of mental satiety is higher than the post of physical satiety, permanent satiety is more valuable than momentary satiety
 sukhi jivan ke liy saralata, sanyam, parimitata bahut sahaayak hoti hai
 This was the opinion and conduct of Epicurus, but the fundamental principle proved very strong for his followers
 yadi jivan main tripti hi ekmaatr mulya kii vastu he to jitani adhik maatra main yah mil sake, jitani jaldi mil sake, ise praapt karnaa chahie
 For ordinary people, this is the Epicurean principle - "eat, drink and be happy" This is the biography in the extreme state
 yah yunaan kii sthiti ke anukool tha, vahiin kuch der ke liye tikaa rahaa
 According to Zino's view, the only value of life is virtue
 sadachaar kaa tatv aavegon par vijayi hota he
 For this, two things are needed - a person can rise above both happiness and sorrow
 stoic vichaar ke anusaar jivan main moulik sutara yah he- ksht sahan karo, bhogon main alipt raho
 This ideology was not compatible with the situation of Greece at that time, from there it reached Rome, where it found a suitable environment
 roman veerta or stoic manovriti paryaayavachi shabd ban gaye
 The Stoic ideology found many worthy broadcasters in Rome
 inamen apictitus or samrat marcus auralius ke naam vikhyath he
 Stoic thought wanted to make life a fit of human nature; Wisdom is the main part in this nature and good life is the one in which the intellect rules

 Aryashtangam Marg is one of the major teachings of Mahatma Buddha, which has been described as a means of attaining freedom from suffering and self-knowledge
 ashtaang maarg ke sabhi 'maarg', 'samyak' shabd se armbh hote hai 
 In Buddhist symbols, ashtanga passages are often represented by the eight todos of the Dharmachakra
 kii shrenee kaa hissaa According to Buddhism, the Arya Ashtanga Path of the Fourth Arya Truth is - the way to get rid of sorrow
 gautam buddha kehete the ki chaar arya satya kii satyata kaa nishchay karne ke liye is maarg kaa anusaran karnaa chahie : Some people consider the Arya Ashtanga Marg as a path, in which to move forward, it is necessary to attain the level of the previous
 or logon ko lagata he ki is maarg ke str sab saath-saath paae jate he
 The route is classified into three parts: Pragya, Sheel and Samadhi
 bhagavan buddha ne bataaya ki trishna hi sabhi du:khon kaa mul kaaran he
 Due to craving, man tends towards different things in the world; And when he cannot get them or when they are destroyed even after receiving, then he feels sad
 trishna ke saath mrityu praapt karanevaala praani uski prerana se phir bhi janm grahan karata he or sansar ke du:khachakr main pisataa rahata he
 Therefore, the way to satisfy Trishna completely is the path to salvation
 ise du:kha-nirodh-gamini pratipada kehete hai
 Lord Buddha has given eight parts of this path: is maarg ke pratham do ang pragna ke or antim do samadhi ke hai
 The middle four are of modesty
 is tarah sheel, samadhi or pragna inhen teen main aathon angon kaa sannivesh ho jaataa he
 Only when modesty is pure can one enter into spiritual life
 shuddh sheel ke aadhaar par mumukshu dhyanabhyas kar samadhi kaa laabh karata he or samadhisth avasthaa main hi use satya kaa saakshaatkaar hota he
 This is called Pragya, as soon as it becomes enlightened, the seeker is interviewed with the impermanent, anonymous and sad nature of mere power
 pragna ke alok main iskaa agyanandhkaar nasht ho jaataa he
 This leaves all the desires of the world
 vitatrishna ho vah kahin bhi ahankaar mamkaar nahin karata or sukh du:kha ke bandhan se upar uth jaataa he
 Due to the absence of craving for the difference of this life, there is no one to take birth again
 is prakaar, sheel-samadhi-pragnawala maarg aath angon main vibhakt ho arya aashtangik maarg kaha jaataa he

 sanyukt rajya ke samvidhan ke mutabik, raashtrapati desh or sarkaar donon kaa pramukh he
 The presidency is the highest political office in the United States by influence and recognition as the executive branch of the country and head of the federal government
 raashtrapati sanyukt rajya america ke sashastr balon kaa pramukh bhi he
 The President is indirectly elected for a four-year term by an electoral college
 1951 main sanyukt rajya america ke samvidhan main baiswein sanshodhan ke baad se koi bhi vyakti do baar se adhik raashtrapati nirvaachit nahin kiya ja saktaa he or koi bhi jisane do saal se zyaada raashtrapati kaa kaarybhaar sambhala he jab koi or nirvaachit hua tha, ek se adhik baar chune nahin ja sakate hai
 If an incumbent President resigns in the middle of the office or is removed or dies, the Vice President assumes his office in this situation
 kisi vyakti ko raashtrapati banane ke liye 35 yaa usase adhik varsh kaa hona jaruri he, nunatam 14 saal wo sanyukt rajya america main rahe hon or wo "prakritik rup se janme" america ke naagarik ho
 To date 43 people have held the presidency and have served 44 terms, since Grover Cleveland Garral had been elected president twice

 It is an ancient cave-temple dedicated to Hidimbi Devi or Hirama Devi

 According to an inscription engraved in the temple, this temple was built by Raja Bahadur Singh in 1553 AD

 The temple is situated on a hill near the city of Manali

 Surrounded by deodar trees, the beauty of this temple is seen after the snowfall
 tapas yaa tap kaa mul arth tha prakaash athwa prajvalan jo surya yaa agni main spasht hota he
 But gradually, his orthodoxy developed and the somatic suffering that was taken for the attainment of a particular purpose or for spiritual and physical discipline began to be called austerity
 vastav main tapas kii bhaavana kaa vikaas chaar purushartho or chaar ashramon ke siddhant ke vikaas kaa parinaam tha
 All these thoughts are from the later Vedic era and if there is no special mention of austerities in the Rigveda, then it is not surprising
 haan tapas kaa vah swaroop, jo tantric or guhyak hota he tathaa jiskaa uddeshy duusare ko haani pahunchaana athwa duusare ke akraman se apane ko bachaana hota he, anarya tatwon se shudra avashya prabhavit prathit hota he
 Originally, a monk who wanted to attain salvation was engaged in penance
 brahamnon or upanishdon main uski charchaayen milane lagati hai or brahm kii prapti uskaa uddeshy ho jaataa he
 All renunciation was considered necessary for him and it was understood that in order to be free from the shackles of traffic in the world, not only disinterest, moral life is also necessary
 at: jivan ke sabhi sukhon kaa tyaag hi nahin, sharir ko anek prakaar se jalaana athwa ksht dena bhi prarambh ho gaya
 Some foreign scholars consider the ideas contained in austerities as not Arya and Vedic, as the gift of non-vedic tribals
 kintu yah sahi nahin prathit hota
 The non-aryan and non-vedic elements gradually absorbed into the Shudra class of the Vedic society, which the leaders of the ancient religion and society did not give the right to penance
 vipareet aacharan karne vaale shanbuk jaise tapasvi shudra to dandit bhi hue
 If the ideology of tapas had started with those non-human elements, then this situation would have been impossible
 uddeshyon kii bhinnata se tapasya ke anek prakaar or rup maane gaye
 Vidhyadhyayi Brahmachari, son of a householder desirous of wealth and spiritual pleasures, a seeker of God, absorbed in Brahman and inspired by desire for salvation, a saintly man or woman seeking love, a devotee in God and the Goddess seeking the grace of God, the common man, self-righteousness and ordinary religion Many types of people, who follow ordinary people, meditate in different forms The Sinddhant believe and use it
 tapas kii pravriti kaa centre tha sharir ko ksht dena
 The more multiple forms or stiffness of it, the more the climax of tapas is considered
 saadhaaran tapasvi wo vatkaladasan, bhutishaiya, alpaahar, jatajutdhaaran, nakhvriddhi, vedoccharan, yajyakriyaatmakataa or dayalutaa ke abhyaas maatr tak simit rahata tha, kintu ugr tapasvi garmi kii ritu main panchagni, varsha main khulaavaas, jaade main jalanivaas athwa bhiige kapadon ko pahinakar baahar rahanaa, teen samay snaan, kandamulashan, bhikshatan, basti se dur nivas or sharir ke sabhi sukhon ko tyaag kar use ksht dena tapasya kaa lakshan mana jane laga
 Parvati's penance is the prime example to achieve Shiva
 yahi nahin, ek mudra se, yatha--haathon ko uthaae rakhana, chalate rahanaa athwa isi prakaar ke anya rupakon kaa dhaaran- kuch dinon athwa jivan bhar banaae rakhana tam kii paraakaashtha samajhi jane lagi
 Even today many such ascetic and hathayogis will meet in all corners of India, especially in pilgrimage, ashrams, river banks and mountains
 sarsaadhaaran varg or kabhi kabhi to subodh kintu vishwasi or shraddhalu samaaj bhi, aise tapasviyon kaa aadar karata rahaa he tathaa unamem kisi atimanviya athwa aadhyatmik shakti ke pratishthit hone main vishwaas bhi karata rahaa he
 But it is difficult to say how much faith the intellectual class with critical intelligence has placed on him
 paashchaatya deshon ke log yah maan lete hai ki paurvatyon main kshtsahan or shaarikik taap ko angeekrut kar lene kii aseem kshamta he or ve paradheenata, bhautik atyaachaar or anyaay ke pratikaar main apane ko ksht dekar usase upar uthne athwa bachane kii koshish karte hai
 For this reason from the mind of Shopenhaar, a pessimism and sadism was born in the countries of the East, whose characteristics were the renunciation of the world, the renunciation, the saintly life, the torture of the body and the unnatural and amnological tendency of suppression of desires
 kintu aisa lagata he ki ye vichaarak bhartiya jivan ke lakshyon main arth kaam kii siddhi ke peeche us pravritimulak manovaigyanik or shuddh bhautik vishleshan kaa utana dhyaan nahin karte, jitna nivrittimulak moksh ke bhav or uski prapti ke upayon kaa
 Accordingly, the social analysis of tenacity found in Manusmriti is a concern
 tadnusaar chaaturvarnyon kaa tap dharamshastra vihit unka karmmaatr he, yatha brahman ke dwaara gyaan kii prapti, kshatriya ke dwaara samaaj kii raksha, vaisya ke dwaara krishi, goraksha or vaanijya tathaa shudra ke dwaara dwijatiyon kii seva
 From the social point of view, this religion - performing its duties - was the most important tenacity
 bhagavadgita main to tap or sanyas ke darshanik paksh kaa sarvattam swaroop dikhaai detaa he or uske shareerik, vaachik or maansik tathaa satvik, rajasi or taamasi prakaar bataae gaye hai
 Physical asceticism is rooted in Dev, Dwij, Guru and non-violence, Vachic austerity is by Anudevagarkar Vani, truth and love and speech and self-discipline and mental austerity is proven by happiness, gentleness, self-realization and sentimentation of the mind
 iske saath hi uttam tam to he satvik jo shraddhapurvak fal kii ichha se virakt hokar kiya jaataa he
 Conversely, the princely penance or foolishness which is done for hospitality, honor and worship, by giving many problems to oneself to torment another, is not ideal
 spasht he, bhartiya tapas main jivan ke shaashvat mulyon kii prapti ko hi sarvocch sthaan diya gaya he or nishkaam karm uskaa sabase bada maarg mana gaya he

 On Venus, there may have been oceans in the past, but due to the continuous greenhouse effect, they must have evaporated with increasing temperature
 Most of the water is likely to be light-dissociated, and, due to the lack of planetary magnetic fields, free hydrogen has been flown into interplanetary space by solar wind

 Objects with less than a certain kinetic energy are slowed down by the atmosphere so much that they do not form a striking crater
 vyas me 50 kimi se kam ke aane vaale prakshyep khand-khand ho jaaenge or sataha par pahunchane se pehle hi vayumandal main bhasma ho jaaenge
 Without seismic data or inertial information, little direct information is available about the internal structure and geochemistry of Venus
 shukr or prithvi ke bich aakaar or ghanatv main samanta bataati he, wein samaan aantarik sanrachana saajha karti he: ek kor, ek mental or ek crust
 Like on Earth, Venus' core is at least partially liquid because the cooling rate of these two planets has been almost the same
 shukr kaa thodaa chota aakaar bataata he, iske gahare aantarik bhaag main dabaav prithvi se kaaphi kam hai
 The major difference between these two planets is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics on Venus, possibly because its crust is too strong for underwater abduction to make it less viscous
 iske parinamswaroop grah se garmi kii kami kam ho jaati he, ise thanda karne se rokatii he or aantarik rup se jenerate kiye gaye chumbakeey kshetra kii kami ke liye sambhavit spashtikaran pradaan kiya jaataa he
 Despite this, Venus may lose its internal heat intermittently in major restructuring events
 shukr kaa vayumandal atyant ghanaa he, jo mukhya rup se carbon dioxide or nitrogen kii ek choti maatra se milakar bana he
 The atmospheric mass is 93 times that of the Earth's atmosphere, while the pressure on the planet's surface is 92 times that of the Earth's surface pressure - this pressure is equal to the pressure of a kilometer close to the Earth's oceans
 is

 This makes the surface of Venus more hot than Mercury
 budh kaa nunatam satahi taapmaana −220 °C or adhiktam satahi taapmaana 420 °C he
 Mercury receives only 25% of solar radiation, despite the planet Venus being twice as close to the Sun
 praayah shukr kii sataha naarkeey rup main varnit he
 This temperature is also higher than the temperature used to achieve sterilization
 adhyayanon ne bataaya he ki shukr kaa vaataavaran haal kii tulana main arabon saal pehle prithvi kii tarah bahut zyada tha or vahaan sataha par taral pani kii paryaapt maatra rahi ho sakati he
 However, after a period ranging from 60 million to several billion years, the evaporation of the original water caused a runaway greenhouse effect, which produced a significant level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere there
 However, the superficial situation on the planet is not a long guest for any earth-like life, which may have been before this event
 yah sambhaavna ki ek rahane yogya duusari jagah nichle or madhyam badal paraton main maujud he, shukr ab bhi daud se baahar nahin hua he
 Thermal inertia and heat transfer by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that Venus's surface temperature does not vary significantly between night and day sides, despite that the planet's rotation is extremely slow
 sataha par hawaaen dhimi hai, prati ghante kuch hi kilometre kii duuri chalati he, lekin shukr ke sataha par vaataavaran ke ucch ghanatv kii vajah se, ve avarodhon ke khilaaf ullekhneey maatra kaa bal daalati he or sataha bhar main dhul or chote pattharon kaa parivahan karti he
 This alone would have made it difficult for the human to walk, otherwise heat, pressure and lack of oxygen were not a problem
 saghan CO2 parat ke upar ghaney badal hai jo mukhya rup se sulfur dioxide or salphurik amla kii buundon se milakar bane he
 These clouds reflect and disperse about 90% of the sunlight that falls back on them in space and prevent visual observation of Venus's surface
 badalon ke sthaayee aavaran kaa arth he ki bhale hi shukr grah prithvi kii tulana main surya se najadik he, par shukr kii sataha acchhee tarah se tapi nahin he
 The powerful winds of 300 km / h at the top of the clouds revolve around the planet every four to five Earth days
 shukr kii hawaaen uski ghurnan ke 60 gune tak gatisheel he, jabaki prithvi kii sabase tej hawaaen ghurnan gati kii keval 10% se 20% hai
 The surface of Venus is effectively isothermal, maintaining a constant temperature not only between day and night but also between the equator and the poles
 grah kaa alp aksheeya jhukaav bhi mausami taapmaana vividhta ko kam karata he
 Significant variation in temperature is found only with altitude
 1995 main, magelan jaanch ne ucchtam parvat shikhar ke sheersh par ek atyadhik pratibimbit padaarth kaa chithran kiya jo sthaliy barf ke saath ek majboot samanta thi
 This substance is arguably made from a similar process to ice, albeit at much higher temperatures
 sataha par ghulansheel karne ke liye bahut asthir, yah gas ke rup main ucch oonchai ko thanda karne ke liye gulab, jahaan yah varsha ke rup main gir gaya
 The identity of this substance is not known with certainty, but speculation leads from elemental tellurium to sulfide

 Lightning has been disputed ever since the first suspicious shower was detected by the Soviet Venera Probe
 2006-07 main venus express ne spasht rup se whistler mod tarangon kaa pataa lagaaya, jo bijli kaa chinhak he
 Their intermittent appearance indicates a pattern associated with weather activity

 In 2007, the Venus Express probe discovered that a massive double atmospheric vortex exists at the south pole of the planet
 2011 main venus express prob dwaara ek anya khoj kii gai or vah he, shukr ke vaataavaran kii oonchai main ek ozon parat maujuud he
 On 29 January 2013, ESA scientists reported that the ionosphere of the planet Venus flows outward, which is similar in the sense that "a comet was observed to be bombarded by a comet under similar conditions"
 " In 1967, Venera 4 found Venus' magnetic field much weaker than that of Earth
 yah chumbakeey kshetra ek aantarik dynamo, prithvi ke andruni kor kii tarah, kii bajaay inmandal or saura vaayu ke bich ek antahkriya dwaara prerit he
 The small induced magnetic field of Venus gives the atmosphere negligible protection against cosmic radiation
 yah vikiran badal dar badal bijli nirvahan kaa parinaam ho saktaa he
 Despite the Earth being equal in size, the lack of an internal magnetic field on Venus was surprising
 It was also expected that its core holds a dynamo
 ek dynamo ko teen chizon kii zarurat hoti he: ek suchalak taral, ghurnan or sanvahan
 The core is thought to be electrically conductive, while its rotation is often thought to be too slow, simulations show that this is sufficient for a dynamo formation
 iskaa taatpary he, dynamo gum he kyonki shukr ke kor main sanvahan kii kami he
 On Earth, convection occurs in the outer layer of the core because the bottom liquid layer is much hotter than the top
 shukr par, ek vaishvik punarsatahikaran ghatana ne plate vivartaniki ko band kar diya ho saktaa he or yah bhupatal se hokar ushma pravaah ke ghataav kaa kaaran bana
 This caused the mantle temperature to rise, leading to increased heat flow outside the core
 natijatan, ek chumbakeey kshetra chalaane ke liye koi aantarik bhudinamo uplabdh nahin he
 Instead, the thermal energy released from the core is used again and again to reheat the crust
 ek sambhaavna yah ki shukr kaa koi thos bhitari kor nahin he, yaa iskaa kor vartmaan main thanda nahin he, isliye kor kaa puraa taral hissaa lagbhag ek hi taapmaana par he
 Another possibility is that its core is already completely frozen
 kor kii avasthaa gandhak ke sandran par atyadhik nirbhar he, jo philhal agyaat he
 The weak magnetic mantle around Venus means the solar wind makes direct contact with the planet's outer atmosphere
 yahaan, hydrogen va oxigen ke aayan parabangnee vikiran se nikle tatasth anuon ke viyojan dwaara banaaye gayi he
 The solar wind then supplies energy that gives some of these ions sufficient velocity to drain from the planet's magnetic field
 is ksharan prakriya kaa parinaam nimna-dravyaman hydrogen, helium or oxigen yanon kii haani ke rup me hoti he, jabaki ucch-dravyaman anuon, jaise ki carbon dioxide, ko usee tarah se zyada banaaye rakhane ke liye hoti he
 Atmospheric erosion by the solar wind probably caused the biggest loss of water during the billions of years after the planet's formation
 is ksharan ne upari vayumandal main ucch-dravyaman duterium se nimna-dravyaman hydrogen ke anupaat ko nichle vayumandal main anupaat kaa 150 guna badha diya he
 Venus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 0
72 AU and completes one round every 224
65 days
 yadhyapi sabhi grahiy kakshaen dirghavrittiya hai, shukr kii kaksha 0
01 se kam kii ek vikendrata ke saath, vrittakar ke zyada kareeb he
 When Venus lies between the planet Earth and the Sun, this position is called inferior conjunction, which makes its reach closest to the Earth, the other planets being at an average distance of 4
1 crores
 shukr ausatan har 584 dinon main avar sangyojan par pahunchataa he
 Due to the decreasing eccentricity of the Earth's orbit, this minimum distance will be maximum after tens of thousands of years
 san 1 se lekar 5383 tak, 4 crores kimi se kam kii 526 pahunch he, phir lagbhag 60,158 varshon tak koi pahunch nahin he
 During the period of highest decentralization, Venus can reach nearly 3
82 crore km
 soramandal ke sabhi grah surya kii parikrama ek vamavart disha main karte he, jaisaa ki surya ke uttari dhruv ke upar se dekha gaya
 Most planets also rotate in an anti-clockwise direction on their axis, but Venus rotates counterclockwise once every 243 Earth days, which is the slowest rotation period of any planet
 is prakaar ek shukr nakshatra diwas ek shukr varsh se lambey samay tak rahata he
 The equator of Venus rotates at a speed of 6
5 km / h, while the rotation at the equator of the Earth is about 1,670 km / h
 shukr kaa ghurnan 6
5 minute / shukr nakshatra diwas tak dhimaa ho gaya he, jab se magalan antariksh yaan ne 16 saal pehle uskaa daura kiya he
 Due to retrograde rotation, the length of a solar day on Venus is much shorter than that of its sidereal day, which is 116
75 Earth days
 shukr kaa ek varsh lagbhag 1
92 shukr saura diwas lanbaa he
 For an observer from the land of Venus, the sun will rise in the west and set in the east
 shukr grah, vibhinn ghurnan avadhi or jhukaav ke saath ek saura niharika se gathit hua ho saktaa he
 Due to tidal effects on dense atmospheres and disturbed rotational shifts induced by planetary ejection, it has reached its present position
 yah badlaav jo ki arabon varshon kii kriyavidhi uparaant ghatit hua hoga
 The rotation period of Venus probably represents a state of equilibrium that forms between the tidal tightness of the Sun's gravity that tends to slow rotation and an atmospheric tide created by the solar heating of the dense Venus atmosphere
 shukr kii kaksha or uski ghurnan avadhi ke bich ke 584-divasiy ausat antaraal kaa ek rochak pahalu yah he ki shukr kii prithvi se uttarottar najdiki pahunch kareeb-kareeb paanch shukr saura divaso ke thik baraabar he
 However, the hypothesis of a rotating-orbital resonance with the Earth has been missed
 shukr kaa koi prakritik upgrah nahin he, haalanki kshudragrah 2002 VE68 vartmaan main iske saath ek ardh kakshiya sambandh rakhata he
 Apart from this quasi satellite, it has two other floating co-orbital 2001 CK32 and 2012 XE33
 17 veen sadi main giovanni casini ne shukr kii parikrama kar rahe chandramaa kii soochna di jo neith se namit kiya gaya tha | agle 200 varshon ke uparaant anekon drashtvyon kii soochna di gai | parantu adhikansh ko aasapaas ke sitaron kaa hona nirdhaarit kiya gaya tha
 At the California Institute of Technology, 2006 studies by Alex Almy and David Stevenson on former solar systems show that Venus had at least one moon like ours that was created by a major collision event Arbo years ago
 adhyayan ke mutabik kareeb ek karod saal baad ek anya takkar ne grah kii ghurnan disha ulat di
 This caused the rotation or orbit of the Moon of Venus to slowly shrink inward until it collided with Venus and merged into it
 yadi baad kii takkaron ne chandramaa banaaye he to wein bhi usee tarah se khinch liye gaye
 An alternative explanation for the absence of satellites is the effect of powerful solar tides that can destabilize large satellites orbiting the inner terrestrial planets
 shukr kisi bhi taare kii tulana main hameshaa ujjwal he
 The most radiant, relative magnitude −4
9, occurs during the crescent phase when it is near the Earth
 shukr kareeb −3 pariman tak mand pad jaataa he jab yah surya dwaara chupa liya jaataa he
 This planet appears quite bright in the clear afternoon sky, and can be easily seen when the sun is low on the horizon
 ek avar grah ke rup main, yah hameshaa surya se lagbhag 47° ke bheetar hota he
 Venus crosses the Earth every 584 days, orbiting the Sun
 jaisaa ki yah dikhaai detaa he, yah suryaast ke baad "sanjh kaa tara" se lekar suryoday se pehle "bhor kaa tara" tak badal jaataa he
 The inflection of Mercury, another inferior planet, reaches a maximum of only 28 ° and is often barely recognized in the twilight, while Venus is difficult to miss at its maximum radiance
 iske adhik se adhik adhiktam prasarkon kaa matlab he yah suryaast ke ekadam baad tak andhere aasmaan main najar aata he
 There is a simple misrepresentation of Venus as an "unknown flying table" as a bright point in the sky
 america raashtrapati jimi carter ne 1969 main ek udan tastari dekhe jane kii soochna di, jiske vishleshan ne baad main grah hone kii sambhaavna kaa suzav diya tha | anginat anya logon ne shukr ko asaadhaaran maanane kii bhul kii he
 As Venus revolves around its orbit, in telescopic scenery it exhibits arts like the moon: in the arts of Venus, the planet presents a small "full" image when it is in the opposite direction to the Sun
 , When it is at the maximum angle from the Sun, exhibits a large "quartz art", and the night is at its maximum brightness in the sky, and as it moves between the Earth and the Sun
 Eepsth presents comes somewhere around the telescope a huge "skinny crescent" in the scenery
 shukr jab prithvi or surya ke bichobich hota he, apane sabase bade aakaar par hota he or apni "nav kala" prastut karata he
 Its atmosphere can be seen in a telescope by the aura of refracted light around the planet
 shukr kii kaksha prithvi kii kaksha ke saapeksh thodi jhuki hui he; isliye, jab yah grah prithvi or surya ke bich se gujarata he, aamtaur par surya ke mukhaakriti ko paar nahin karata
 Transit Venus is found when the planet's inferior conjunction coincides with the presence in the Earth's orbital plane
 shukr ke pargaman 243 saal ke chakron main hote hai
 In the current mode of transit, the first two transits take place at an interval of eight years, then a longer break of about 105
5 years or 121
5 years, and again at the beginning of the new transit pair of eight-year intervals

 The so-called Bhasmavarna Prakash is a mystery of long-standing Venus observations
 bhasmavarn prakaash shukr ke andhkaar paksh kii ek sukshma roshni he or najar aati he jab grah arddh chandrakaar charan main hota he
 The first claim to see this light was made long back in 1643, but the existence of the light could never be reliably confirmed
 paryvekshakon ne anumaan lagaaya he, yah shukr ke vayumandal main bijli kii gatividhi se niklaa parinaam ho saktaa he, lekin yah bhraamak ho saktaa he
 This may be the result of the illusion of seeing a bright, crescent shaped object
 shukr grah ko "subah ke taare" or "shaam ke taare" donon hi roopon main pracheen sabhyataaon ne jaan liya tha
 Before the name itself, it is clear that they were two different things
 Ammisaduka's Venus table, dated 1581 BCE, shows the Greek understanding that the two objects were the same
 is patalika main shukr ko "akaash kii ujjwal rani" ke rup main nirdisht kiya gaya he or vistrut prekshanon ke saath is drushtikon kaa samarthan kiya ja sakaa he
 By the time of Pythagoras in the sixth century BCE, the Greeks had the concept of two different stars as Phosphorus and Hesperus
 romanon ne shukr ke subah kii pahalu ko lucifer ke rup main or shaam ke pahalu ko wesper ke rup main namit kiya he
 The first recorded observation of the transit of Venus coincided with Jeremiah Horrocks on 4 December 1639, along with his friend William Krebtree
 17 veen sadi kii shuruyaat main jab italvi bhautik vigyaani galileo galilei ne grah kaa pratham avlokan kiya, unhone use chandramaa kii tarah kalaon ko dikhaaya hua paaya, ardhachandra se unnatodar se lekar poornachandra tak or thik iske ulat
 When it is farthest from the Sun, it shows its crescent form and when it is closest to the Sun it looks like crescent or full moon

 Venus' atmosphere was discovered in 1761 by the Russian erudite Mikhail Lomonosov
 shukr ke vayumandal kaa avlokan 1790 main german khagolashastri yohan shrotor dwaara hua tha
 Schröter found that when the planet was a thin crescent, the bowl extended more than 180 °
 unhone sahi anumaan lagaaya ki yah ghaney vaataavaran main surya prakaash ke bikharane kii vajah se tha
 Later, when the planet was in inferior conjunction, American astronomer Chester Smith Leaman observed a full ring around its dark side and provided evidence for the atmosphere
 The atmosphere complicated efforts to determine a rotation period for the planet, and observers such as Italian-born astronomer Giovanni Cassini and Schröter incorrectly estimated periods of about 24 hours from the motions of markings on the planet's apparent surface
 By the 20th century, there was a lot more discovery about Venus
 isaki kareeb-kareeb akritiheen disk ne koi suraag nahin diya ki isaki sataha aakhir kis tarah kii ho sakati he
 More of its mysteries occurred with the development of exposure, spectroscopy, radar, and ultraviolet observations
 pehle parabangnee prekshan 1920 ke dashak main kiye gaye jab frank i ross ne paaya ki parabangnee tasveeron ne kaaphi vistrut byoraa dikhaaya jo drishy or avarakt vikiran main anupasthit tha
 He suggested that this was due to the extremely dense thickening of the paralysis cloud above it with a lower yellow atmosphere
 1900 ke dashak main spectroscopy prekshanon ne shukr ke ghurnan ke bare main pehla suraag diya
 Westo Slifer tried to measure the Doppler shift of light emitted from Venus, but found that he could not detect any rotation
 unhone anumaan lagaaya grah kii ek bahut lambii ghurnan avadhi honi chahie
 Subsequent work in the 1950s showed that the rotation was retrograde
 shukr ke radar prekshan sarvapratham 1960 ke dashak main kiye gaye the, isane ghurnan avadhi kii pehali maap pradaan kii, jo aadhunik maan ke kareeb thi
 Radar observations revealed the surface of Venus for the first time in the 1970s

 For Venus, like any other planet, the first robotic spacecraft mission began on 12 February 1961 with the launch of the Venera 1 probe
 soviet venera kaarykram antargat yah pehla yaan tha
 Venera 1 lost contact on the seventh day of the mission, when it was 20 million km from Earth
 shukr ke liye sanyukt rajya america kaa anveshan bhi prakshepan sthal par hi meriner 1 yaan ko khone ke saath bure haal me shuru hua
 But its follow-up, Mariner 2, was a success

 Its microwaves and infrared radiometers showed that most of Venus' upper clouds were calm, while earlier ground-based measurements confirmed Venus's surface temperature to be extremely hot, and ultimately ended the expectation that the planet would land -based life can be a destination
 meriner 2 ne shukr ke dravyaman or khagoleey duuri ko or behatar praapt kiya, par vah chumbakeey kshetra yaa vikiran belt kaa pataa lagane main asamarth tha
 The Soviet Venera 3 vehicle crashed while landing on Venus on 1 March 1966
 It was the first man-made object to enter the atmosphere and hit the surface of another planet
 Even though its communication system failed, before that it was able to transmit all planetary data
 On 18 October 1967, Venera 4 successfully entered the atmosphere and deployed many scientific instruments
 Venera 4 reported the surface temperature to be about 5000 c higher than that measured by Mariner 2, and showed the atmosphere to be about 90 to 95% carbon dioxide
 Venus's atmosphere was quite dense compared to the estimates made by the creators of Venera 4
 This made the parachute slower than the scheduled landing time
 This meant the battery of the vehicle slowed down before reaching the surface
 After transmitting data up to 93 minutes, 24
 ek din baad 19 oktober 1967 ko meriner 5 ne badalon ke sheersh se 4000 kimi se kam kii oonchai par ek guzaaren kaa aayojan kiya | darasal meriner 5 ko mul rup se mangal se jude meriner 4 ke liye ek byaap ke rup main banaaya gaya tha | lekin jab mishan safal rahaa to yaan ko shukr mishan ke liye tabdeel kar diya gaya | iske upkarnon ke jode meriner 2 par kii tulana main adhik samvedansheel the
 In particular, its radio masking experiment transmitted data on the composition, pressure, and density of Venus's atmosphere
 venera 4-meriner 5 ke sanyukt data kaa ek sanyukt soviet-america vigyaan dal dwaara aupchaarik vaartalap kii ek shrinkhalaa main agle varsh bhar main vishleshan kiya gaya
 This is an early example of space cooperation
 venera 4 se siikhe sabak ke baad soviet union ne janvari 1969 ko ek paanch divasiy antaraal me judwein yaan venera 5 or venera 6 ko prakshepit kiya
 They encountered Venus on 16 and 17 May under the guise of one day in the same year
 yaan ke kuchalane kii daab seemaa ko badhaakar 25 baar tak sudrudh kiya gaya or ek tej avataran praapt karne ke liye chote parachute ke saath susajjit kiya gaya
 Later, recent atmospheric models of Venus suggested surface pressures to be between 75 and 100 bar
 isliye in yanon ke sataha par jivit bache rahane kii koi ummid nahin thi | 50 minat ke ek chote antaraal kaa vayumandaleey data preshit karne ke baad donon yaan shukr ke raatri paksh kii sataha par takaraane se pehle takreeban 20 kimi kii oonchai par tabah ho gaye
 Venera 7 was introduced to attempt to retrieve data released from the planet's surface
 ise 180 baar ke dabaav ko bardaasht karne main sakasham ek majboot avataran modul ke saath nirmit kiya gaya tha
 The module was cooled before entry, as well as equipped with a specially collapsible parachute for a quick descent of 35 minutes
 15 disambar 1970 ko yah vayumandal main pravesh karata rahaa, jabaki mana gaya he parachute aanshik rup se fat gaya or prob ne sataha ko ek jor kii takkar maari, par ghaatak nahin
 Perhaps it bent to its place, transmitting some weak signals and supplying temperature data for 23 minutes which was the first telemetry achieved from the surface of another planet
 venera 8 ke saath venera kaarykram jari rahaa | isane 22 july 1972 ko vayumandal me pravesh karne ke baad 50 minat tak sataha se aankde bheje | venera 9 ne 22 oktober 1975 ko vayumandal main pravesh kiya | jabaki venera 10 ne iske thik teen din baad 25 oktober ko vayumandal main pravesh kar shukr ke paridrishy kii pehali tasviren bheji | donon hi yanon ne apane avataran sthalon ke aasapaas ke tatkaalik ekadam alag hi paridrishy prastut kiye
 Venera 9 landed on a 20 degree slope where 30-40 cm stones were scattered all around
 Venera 10 showed haphazard rocks of basalt-type, including seasonal material
 is bich, sanyukt rajya america ne meriner 10 ko us gurutveey gulel prakshepvakr par bheja jisaki raah shukr se hokar budh grah kii ore jaati thi
 On 5 February 1974, Mariner 10 passed 5,790 km from Venus and returned with over 4,000 photographs

 But ultraviolet light showed clouds in detail that Earth-based observations had never seen before
 america pyniyar venus pariyojna ne do alag-alag abhiyaanon ko shaamil kiya tha
 The Pioneer Venus Orbiter was placed on 4 December 1978 in an elliptical orbit around Venus
 yah 13 saal se adhik samay tak vahaan bana rahaa
 It measured surface exposure with radar and studied the atmosphere
 pyniyar venus multiprob ne kul chaar jaanch-yaan chode jisane 9 disambar 1978 ko vayumandal main pravesh kiya or isaki sanrachana, hawaaon or ooshmaa apshishton par data preshit kiya
 Four more Venera lander missions took place over the next four years

 All four missions were deployed in the upper atmosphere with parachutes for deadlock, but were freed at an altitude of 50 km, as the dense lower atmosphere of Venus provided sufficient friction for comfortable landing without any additional means 
 venera 13 or 14 donon ne eks-re pratidipti spectrometer ke saath on-board mitti ke namoonon kaa vishleshan kiya or pravishthi takkar ke saath kii mitti kii sampidta maapne kaa prayaas kiya
 Venera 14, however, dropped the lens cover of its own camera, and its entry failed to touch the soil
 oktober 1983 main venera kaarykram ko band karne kaa tab samay aa gaya, jab venera 15 or venera 16 ko synthetic epperchar radar ke saath shukr ke ilaakon ke maanchitran sanchaalan ke liye kaksha main sthapit kiya gaya
 In 1985, the Soviet Union took advantage of the opportunity of joint missions by Venus and the Halley comet passing through the inner solar system in the same year
 11 or 15 june 1985 ko heley ke padane vaale raste par vega kaarykram ke do antariksh yanon se venera-style kii ek-ek pravishthi giraai gai or upari vayumandal ke bheetar ek gubbaaraa-samarthit airobot chhoda gaya
 The balloons achieved a balanced altitude near 53 km, where the pressure and temperature are comparatively similar to those on the Earth's surface

 Early ground-based radars provided a basic understanding of the surface
 pyniyar venus or venera ne behatar samaadhaan pradaan kiye
 The United States Magellan probe was launched on 4 May 1989 with a mission for surface mapping of Venus from radar

 Four of these elements are also mentioned in ancient Greek - except the sky
 yunaan ke arestu or faras ke rasajna jabir ebn hayyaan iske pramukh panthi maane jate hai
 Similar to Hindu ideology, Panchatatva has been considered important and esoteric in Greek, Japanese and Buddhist beliefs

 Element Pran explains specific forms of energy
 praan inhi paanch tatwon se milakar bana he - thik usee prakaar jaise hamaara sharir or anya kai chiz
 The Mandukyopanishad, the Quakopanishad and the Shiva Swarodaya believe that the five elements have evolved from the mind, the soul from the soul, and the soul from the samadhi
 jaisaa ki upar kaha gaya he, sadhak yogi tatv kaa pataa lagaakar apane bhavishya kaa pataa laga lete hai

 jal sansaadhan pani ke vah strot hai jo maanav ke liye upyogi hon yaa jinke upyog kii sambhaavna ho
 Water uses include agriculture, industrial, domestic, recreational and environmental activities
 vastutah in sabhi maanviya upyogon main se zyaadaatar main taaje jal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The total amount of water available on the earth or reservoir is called a hydrosphere
 prithvi ke is jalmandal kaa 97
5% bhaag samudron main khaare jal ke rup main he or keval 2
5% hi meetha pani he, uskaa bhi do tihaai hissaa himand or dhruviya kshetron main him chaadaron or him tapiyon ke rup main jamaa he
 The remaining molten sweet water is found mainly in the form of water, only a small portion of which is in the form of ground water above the ground or atmospheric water in the air
 meetha pani ek navikarniya sansaadhan he kyonki jal chakra main prakritik rup se iskaa shuddhikaran hota rahata he, phir bhi vishwa ke svachh pani kii paryaaptta lagaataar gir rahi he duniya ke kai hisson main pani kii maang pehle se hi aapurti se adhik he or jaise-jaise vishwa main jansankhya main abhootpurv dar se vruddhi ho rahi hai, nikat bhavishya main is asantulan kaa anubhav badhane kii ummid he
 The framework for allocation of water resources to water users is known as water rights
 aaj jal sansaadhan kii kami, iske avanayan or isse sambandhit tanaav or sangharsh vishwaraajnneeti or rashtriya raajnneeti main mahatvapurn mudde hai
 Water disputes have become important topics at both national and international levels

 Surface water is naturally met by precipitation and glacial melting in an aquifer and is naturally lost by subsistence in the oceans, evaporation from the surface and seepage down to the earth
 haalaanki ki kisi bhi kshetreey jal tantra main pani kaa prakritik strot varshan hi he or isaki maatra us basin kii bhugolic avasthiti or aakaar par nirbhar he
 Also the total amount of water in a water system is dependent on many other factors at any given time
 in karkon main shaamil hai jhiilon, ardrabhumiyon or kritrim jalaashyon main bhandaaran kshamta; in bhandaron ke neeche sthit mitti kii pargamyata; basin ke bheetar dharatleey apvaah ke abhilakshan; varshan kii avadhi, tivrata or kul maatra or sthaneey vashpikaran kaa str ityadi
 All these factors affect the movement of water in a water system and its budget
 maanav gatividhiyaan in karkon par ek bade paimaane par prabhaav daal sakati hai
 Humans often reduce the basin's capacity by building reservoirs by increasing the basin's storage capacity and draining wetlands
 manushya aksar apvaah kii maatra or us kii tezi ko farshabandi or jalmaarg nirdhaaran se badha dete hai
 It is also important to pay attention to the total available amount of water at any given time
 manushya dwaara kiye ja rahe jal upyogon main se bahut saare varsh main ek nishchit or alp avadhi ke liye hi hote hai
 For example, many farms require large amounts of water in spring and summer and not at all in winter
 aise khet ko pani uplabdh karne ke liye, sataha jal ke ek vishaal bhandaran kshamta kii aavashyaktaa hogi jo saal bhar pani iktha kare or us chote samay par use pravaah kar sake jab uski aavashyaktaa ho
 On the other hand, some other uses require continuous water, such as power plants that need constant water for cooling
 aise bijli sanyantr ko pani dene ke liye sataha par pravaahit jal kii keval utani hi maatra ko bhandaarit karne kii aavashyaktaa hogi ki vah nadi main pani ke kam hone kii sthiti main bhi bijli sanyantr ko shitalan ke liye pani uplabdh kara sake
 In the long run, the amount of water that is supplied by precipitation within a basin is the upper limit of water availability for human use of that basin
 prakritik dharatleey jal kii maatra ko kisi duusare basin kshetra se nahar yaa pipe line ke madhyam se aayaat dwaara sanvardhit kiya ja saktaa he
 Man can 'lose' water by pollution
 mithe jal ke bhandaron ke maamle main brazil duniya sabase adhik jal bhandar rakhane vaala desh he jiske baad baad duusare or tisare sthaan par hai rus or canada
 The amount of water flowing downstream in the entire course of the river is not only what appears to be flowing as an independent stream but also a lot of water flows directly below the bottom of the river
 yah pani tali ke asangathit padaarthon ke bich se hokar bahata he jaise ki kankadon or golashmon kii moti parat ke bich se hokar
 Such flow is called flow and it can sometimes be higher than that seen
 nadi ke neeche avapravaah kii is peti ko avapravaah mandal kaha jaataa he
 In a way, it is a box where the difference between ground water and river water is erased
 yah carst pradeshon or tarai kshetra main kaafii mahatvapurn hota he
 Groundwater or ground water is a part of freshwater that is located in the mud and rock foliage
 yah jal str ke neeche jalbhre ke bheetar bahane vaala jal bhi he
 This flow of ground water is called overflow
 kabhi-kabhi sataha ke thik neeche ke jal ko bhoojal tathaa atyadhik gaharaai main paae jane vaale jal ko bhugarbhik jal yaa jeevashm jal bhi kehete hai
 If ground water is considered a huge water reservoir, then the arrival of water in this reservoir or the availability of water in it is caused by the seepage of the surface water above the surface and the expulsion of water from it into the oceans or very deep
 Fossils occur in the form of water
 atah bhoojal bhi kai myanon main dharatleey jal jaisaa hi hota he: jal tantra main aadan-pradaan or bhandaran ke sandarbh main yadi isaki tulana dharatleey jal se kii jaae to mahatvapurn antar yah he ki gamnaagaman kii dhimi gati hone ke kaaran bhoojal ke bhandar aamtaur par dharatleey jal se adhik vishaal or sthai hote hai
 Due to this difference, humans can easily use non-long term use of ground water without serious consequences

 Glacial runoff is also considered as ground water
 mithe jal yaa taaje pani ke upyog ko navikarniya or a-navikarniya prakaaron main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 If water is not immediately available for another use, this use will be non-renewable

 In some regions of the world, irrigation is necessary for any crop, while in other areas it is effective in increasing the growth of more profitable crops or increasing crop yields
 vibhinn sinchai vidhiyon main fasal paidaavaar, jal khapat evam upkarnon or sanrachanaon kii puunji laagat main gamagam shaamil hai
 The sprinklers above or below the surface will be less expensive but also less efficient, as most of the water evaporates or leaks
 More efficient irrigation methods include leak irrigation, flow irrigation and moist irrigation in which the pointer operates near the ground level
 This system is expensive, but it is worthwhile to reduce leakage and evaporation
 There is another swap meets that idea disabled, those with the sub-saline surface water jaleey krishi jal kaa ek chota lekin badhata prayog he
 Commercial fisheries in freshwater are also considered agricultural uses of water, but are given less importance than irrigation

 The use of water in recreation is mostly associated with reservoirs, springs, springs and adventure sports
 yadi ek jalashay main pani kaa str saamaanya kii tulana main adhik rakhaa jaay to manoranjak khapat ke liye uskaa upyog ek navikarniya yaa akshay upyog ke taur par vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 The release of water from some reservoirs is timed for recreational purposes such as white water sightings and rafting etc
 which may be considered recreational uses
 anya udhaaharan skir, prakruti utsaahi or tairaak hai jo jal kaa is rup main upyog karte hai
 In modern civilization facilities like water park can also be counted in this category
 manoranjak upyog aamtaur par gaiyrakshayi hota he
 The golf course is famous for using excessive amounts of water, especially in dry areas
 baharhaal, yah spasht nahin he kii manoranjak sinchai ke liye jal kaa upyog pani ke sansadhano par kya pratyaksh prabhaav daalata he
 This is largely due to the lack of reliable data

 Additionally, use in recreation may also be a reason for a decrease in water availability at specific times and locations for other users
 udhaaharan ke liye pani ke ek jalashay main der garmiyon main naukayan ke liye banaae rakhana or kisaanon ko basant ke mausam kii kheti ke dauraan uplabdh nahin rakhana aisa hi upyog hoga
 The release of water for white water rafting can result in unavailability of water for hydroelectric generation at peak times of electricity demand
 svachh paryaavaran ke liye pani kaa prayog bhi ek bahut chota upyog he lekin badhati kul jal kaa prayog kaa pratishat he
 Environmental water uses include creation of artificial wetlands, artificial lakes required for wildlife habitat, earthen waters around the dam and water discharge from timed reservoirs for fisheries, etc

 The plateau parts of India have always been weak in terms of ground water
 yahan bhoojal kuch khaas bhugarbhik sanrachanaon main paaya jaataa he jaise bhransh ghaatiyon or daraaron ke sahare
 The alluvial plains of northern India have always been rich in ground water, but now an unprecedented reduction has been recorded in the northern western parts due to rapid exploitation of irrigation

 It is important to note that ground water is the source of 60% irrigation and water and about 85% of drinking water in India, in such a situation the fast falling level of ground water is emerging as a big challenge
 jal pradooshan aaj vishwa ke pramukh chintaaon main se ek he
 The governments of many countries have worked hard to find a solution to reduce this problem

 When water scarcity causes political tension, it is called water stress
 jal tanaav aksar kshetreey or sthaneey str par sangharsh kaa kaaran rahaa he
 Water stress can also promote conflict and political tension even if it is not related to water
 samay ke saath taaje pani kii gunvattta yaa maatra jansankhya kii sehat giraate hue aarthik vikaas main avarohak bhi ho sakati he or kshetreey asthirataa badha sakati he
 Water-related conflicts and tensions are also within potential national boundaries, in the lower reaches of the catastrophic river valley, the southern regions of China, for example the Yellow River or the Chao Frye River in Thailand, have suffered from water-related stress for many years
 In addition, China, Arid countries like India, Iran and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on irrigation, are particularly vulnerable to water-related conflicts
 There are political tensions, civilian protests and violence can also be a reaction to the privatization of water

 NPCI started the rupay service in April 2013, while the card payment network normally takes five to seven years to fully function
 ukt tithi tak is network main 70 lakh card jari kiye ja chuke the
 17 banks have supported the rupay Card project
 enpisiai bhartiya reserve bank dwaara gathit sanstha hai
 In 2009, the Reserve Bank had asked the Indian Banks Association to start a non-profit company and design a card domestically like Visa and mastercard
 The rupay card is meant to promote a payments and settlement platform for card transactions at a low processing fee, making it viable for smaller merchant establishments to accept card payments for even low-value transactions
 This is expected to provide a further fillip to card transactions in the country, thereby reducing the use of currency
 In the 2009–12 vision document, the Reserve Bank of India considered the possibilities of establishing an indigenous card for India
 tadnusaar, rupe card ke liye praayogic taur par laanch karne ke liye enpisiai ko adhikrut kiya gaya
 The card was subsequently launched in March 2012
 enpisiai ne 14 may 2011 ko maharashtra main shahari sahakaari kshetra ke gopinath patil parteek janata sahakaari bank ke saath pehla rupe card laanch kiya tha
 After this, the card was issued by the kashi-gomti United Rural Bank on 24 May 2011
 enpisiai ne abhi tak chaar bainkon ko apane saath joda he
 These include two urban cooperative banks, a regional rural bank and a mainstream commercial bank, Bank of India

 - ghategi nakadi par nirbharta raashtrapati mukherjee ne kaha ki aane vaale dinon main bharat jaise vishaal desh main card se lene-dein kaa dayera bahut adhik badhegaa
 He said that the 'rape' system would not only reduce the dependence on cash for transactions but also give the users a variety of payment options in the country
 rape pranali kaa enpisiai ne karaayaa he
 NPCI President Balachandran m said that the board of directors of NPCI has also planned to make 'rape' popular at the international level
 - international card kii laagat se kam keemat par hoga uplabdh is maukey par vittiya seva sachiv ji es sandhu ne kaha ki rape international card kii laagat se kam keemat par uplabdh hoga
 Public sector banks have installed 25,331 Rapid Card atms so far and 9,000 more will be installed during the current financial year

 European travelers, who left here since 1820, described the Lanak Pass as the border of Ladakh and Tibet

 paaritantr yaa paristhitik tantra ek prakritik ikai he jisamen ek kshetra vishesh ke sabhi jeevadharee, arthath paudhe, jaanavar or anujiv shaamil hai jo ki apane ajaev paryaavaran ke saath antarkriya karke ek sampoorn jaivik ikai banaate hai
 Thus ecosystems are a unit of interdependent components that divide the same habitat
 paaritantr aamtaur anek khaadya jaal banaate hai jo paristhitiki tantra ke bheetar in jeevon ke anyonyashray or urja ke pravaah ko dikhaate hai
 The term ecosystem was coined in 1930 by Roy Clapham to denote the combined physical and biological components of an environment
 british paristhitivigyaanshasri arthur tansle ne baad main, is shabd ko parishkrut karte hue yah varnan diya "yah puri pranali


 na keval jeev-parisar he, lekin vah sabhi bhautik karkon kaa puraa parisar bhi shaamil hai jise ham paryaavaran kehete hai"
 Tansley considered ecosystems not only as natural units, but also as "mental isolates"
 tansle ne baad main "ecotope" shabd ke prayog dwaara paaritantron ke sthanik had ko paribhaashit kiya
 The main idea of the ecosystem concept is that living organisms influence every other element in their local environment
 ujin odum, paristhitiki ke ek sansthaapak ne kaha:" ek ikai jisamen sabhi jeev shaamil hon jo bhautik vaataavaran ko prabhavit karen ki pranali ke bheetar urja kaa ek pravaah spasht rup se paribhaashit poshan sanrachana, biotic vibhinnata or saamagree chakra ek paristhitiki tantra he
 "the human ecosystem concept is then based on the interpretation of human / nature bifurcation and on the basis that all species are ecologically integrated with each other and with the biotic organisms of their biotopes
 biom ek paristhitiki tantra ke samaan he jisamen ek mausami or bhugolic drushti se paribhaashit kiya gaya paristhitiki samaan jalwaayu paristhitiyon ke kshetra jaise ki paudhon, pashuon ke samudaayon or mitti avyav ke rup main aksar paaritantr ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 Biomes are defined based on factors such as plant structures, leaf type, plant spacing, and climate
 ichosone ke asmaan, biom, vargeekaran, anuvanshik yaa aitihaasik samanthaayen ke aadhaar par paribhaashit nahin kiya jaataa
 Biomes are often identified with particular samples of ecological sequence and climatic vegetation

 The CBD defines "ecosystem" as: "a dynamic complex of plant, animal, and microbe communities and their inanimate environment that function as a functional unit
" " Along with the need to conserve ecosystems, there was a political need to describe them and identify them efficiently
 Vryugdenhil and Sab say that using a physiognomic-ecological classification system can be achieved most effectively because Ecosystems are easily identifiable on satellite images along the region
 unhone kaha ki sambandhit vanaspati ke sanrachana or mausam-tatv, paristhitik data se purit prayek aaparivartak nirdharak hai jo aanshik rup se alag set prajatiyon ko alag karte hai
 This is true not only for plant species, but also for animal species, fungi and bacteria
 paritantr ke pahchaan kii maatra fisiognomik aaparivartak ke adheen he jise ek chhavi or / yaa kshetra main pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 Special fauna elements may be added where necessary, such as seasonal concentrations of animals and distribution of coral reefs
 kai fisiognomik-paristhitik vargeekaran pranaliyaan uplabdh hai: Several aquatic classification systems are available, an effort being made by the United States Geological Survey and the inter-american Biodiversity Information Network to design an entire ecosystem classification system that will cover both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems
 vigyaan ke pariprekshya se, paaritantr asatat ikayan nahin hai jo keval ek "sahi" vargeekaran drushtikon kaa adhikaar par pahchaane ja sakaten hai
 An attempt by Tensley to describe or classify the ecosystem in agreement with this definition must be clear about the observer / analyst investment in classification, including normative reasoning
 "moulik jivan-aadhaar sevaayen jinpar maanav sabhyataa nirbhar karata he," or yah pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh ho unhen paristhitiki tantra sevaayen kehete hai

 Under this deterministic approach, the abstract idea of ecological health attempts to measure the robustness and recovery potential of an ecosystem, namely how far the ecosystem is away from its steady state
 aksar, haalanki, paristhitiki pranaaliyon kii kshamta ek vighatnkaaree agent se ulat aana padataa he
 The difference between collapse or a benign rebound is determined by two factors - the toxicity of the starting element and the resilience of the original ecosystem
 paaritantron mukhyatah stochastic, in ghatnaon gaiyr par pratikriyaaon bhadakaane-saamagree rahete hai or sharton unhen aasapaas ke avyavon dwaara pratikriyaaon ghatnaon sanchalit kar rahe hai
 Thus, an ecosystem results from the sum of the organism's individual responses to stimuli from the elements in this environment

 Andrewatha or santi kii he ki kshetreey vyavhaar ke str par, jahaan khaadya aapurti ek simit kaarak nahin he aabaadiyon rakhane ke liye jaataa he kaa suzav dete hai
 Therefore, stochastists view regional behavior at the ecosystem level as a regulatory mechanism rather than at the species level
 Thus, in their view, ecosystems are not regulated by the system itself and feedback mechanism and there is no such thing as a balance of nature

 In the absence of an equilibrium of nature, ecosystems have species composition, but the entire ecological collapse that will undergo change will depend on the nature of the changes that will probably be rare events

 chedi kii charchaa na hona or vatsa, avanti ke shaskaon kaa mahatv darshaya janaa is baat kaa pramaan he ki chedi inamen se kisi ek ke adheen rahaa hoga
 The ancient district of Chedi is thus Bundelkhand
 itihaas sakshi he ki bharat kii aazaadee ke pratham sangram kii jwaala meerut kii chhavnee main bhadki thi
 But there is a truth missing behind these historical facts, that 15 years before the war of independence, Meerut started a revolution in Dharmanagri Chitrakoot of Bundelkhand
 pavitra mandakini ke kinare gokshi ke khilaaf ekajute hui hindu-muslim birdari ne mau tehsil main adaalat lagaakar paanch firangi afasaron ko faansee par lataka diya
 After this, whenever the British or any of their hangers tried to cheat in the pride of the Bundelas, they were beheaded
 is kranti ke nayak the aazaadee ke pratham sangram kii jwaala meerut ke sidhe-saadhe harbole
 The 'ghaghra platoon' of Burkhanshini women was also instrumental in taking forward the tales of struggle
 aazaadee ke sangharsh kii pehali mashaal sulgaane vaale bundelkhand ke ranbankure itihaas ke pannon main jagah nahin paa sake, lekin unki shoorveerta kii tasdik firangi afasar khud kar gayi hai
 There is a story buried in the Banda Gazette written by the British authorities, which is known by very few people
 gajetir ke panne palatney par maaloom hua ki varsh 1857 main meerut kii chhavnee main firangiyon kii fouj ke sipaahi mangal pandeya ke vidroh se bhi 15 saal pehle chitrakoot main kranti kii chingaari bhadak chuki thi
 Actually, British officers used to slaughter cows on the banks of the holy Mandakini river in Dharmanagari at that time of the past
 gaumance ko bihar or bengal main bhejkar vahaan se evaj main rasad or hathiyaar mangaye jate the
 The local people were distracted by the killing of a second faith, ie the cow dynasty, on the banks of Mandakini, a symbol of faith, but the tongue was closed due to the fear of the Firangi
 kuch logon ne himmat dikhaate hue maratha shaskaon or mandakini paar ke ‘nayaa gaanv’ ke choube raajaaon se fariyaad lagaayi, lekin donon shaskaon ne angrejon kii mukhaalafat karne se inkaar kar diya
 The request went in vain, as a result a flame of vengeance flared inside the chest
 isi dauraan gaanv-gaanv ghoomane vaale harbolon ne gaukashi ke khilaaf logon ko jaagrit karte hue ekajute karnaa shuru kiya
 Then on the sixth day of June in the year 1842, he did not expect any
 hajaaron kii sankhya main nihathe mazdooron, naujavaanon or burkanashin mahilaon ne mau tehsil ko gherkar firangiyon ke saamne baghawat ke naare buland kiye
 The special thing was that hindu-muslim fraternity had equal participation in this movement against Gaukashi
 tehsil main goron ke khilaaf aawaaj buland hui to bundelon kii bhujaaen fadakane lageen
 After seeing the British officers were hostage, after this, a 'public court' was put under the tree and five British officers were hanged after trial
 janakranti kii yah jwaala mau main dafan hone ke bajaay rajapur bazaar pahunchi or angrej afasar khaded diye gayi
 Seeing the beauty of time, the landlords of Merca and Samagra also jumped into the movement
 do din baad 8 june ko baberu bazaar sulagaa to vahaan ke thanedaar or tehseeldaar ko jaan bachaakar bhaagna padaa
 Along with expelling the British from Joharpur, Palani, Bisalpur, Semri, the revolutionaries in the office of Tindwari Tehsil burnt government records and looted three thousand rupees
 aazaadee kii jwaala bhadakne par gori hukumat ne apane pitthu shaskaon ko hukum jari karte hue krantikariyon ko kuchalane ke liye kaha
 On this decree, Panna Naresh sent a thousand soldiers, a cannon, four elephants and fifty bulls, the queen of Chhatarpur and the king of Gaurihar as well as the army of the king of Ajaygarh had also traveled to Chitrakoot
 duusari ore banda chhavnee main dubake firangi afasaron ne banda nawab se jaan kii guhaar lagaate hue bivi-bacchon ke saath pahunch gayi
 Here to suppress the rebellion, all the soldiers of the army of Indian kings who reached banda-chitrakoot started to step in with the agitators
 nattejey main utsaahi krantikariyon ne 15 june ko banda chhavnee ke prabharee mi
 kakrel ko pakadaney ke baad gardan ko dhad se alag kar diya
 After this, to end the awe of the British from inside Awam, roam the streets of Banda with a severed head
 kakrel kii hatya ke do din baad rajapur, mau, banda, darsenda, tarauhaan, badausa, baberu, pailaani, simauni, sihunda ke bundelon ne yuddh parishad kaa gathan karte hue bundelkhand ko aaazaad ghoshit kar diya
 Convener of "bundelkhand Unified Party" Sanjay Pandey says that when the British officers themselves have written about this revolution, then why did Indian historians not give these facts a place in the pages of history? When asked the truth it was a real mass movement Because there was no leader in it but the general public was the agitator, so it is not possible to ignore the struggle of the Bundelas to find a place in history
