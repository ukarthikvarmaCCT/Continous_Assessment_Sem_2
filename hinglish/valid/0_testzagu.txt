 itani prasiddhi ke baad pehali baar 11 disambar 2014 ko sanyukt raashtra mahasabha ne prayek varsh 21 june ko vishwa yoga diwas ke rup main manyata di he
 The Bhagavadgita is considered to be the reputed text
 usamen yoga shabd kaa kai baar prayog hua he, kabhi akele or kabhi savisheshan, jaise buddhiyog, sanyasayog, karmyog
 The names Bhakti Yoga and Hatha Yoga have also become popular during the Vedas period, Patanjali is seen in Yogadarshan, the word Kriya Yoga
 pashupat yoga or maheshwar yoga jaise shabdon ke bhi prasang milte he
 The meanings of the word yoga in all these places are against each other, but it is clear from looking at various such experiments that it is difficult to define yoga
 paribhaasha aisi honi chahie jo avyaapti or ativyapti dosha se mukt ho, yoga shabd ke vaacharth kaa aisa lakshan batala sake jo prayek prasang ke liye upyukt ho or yoga ke sivaay kisi anya vastu ke liye upyukt na ho
 The word 'yoga' is derived from the use of the suffix 'hh' in the 'yuz samadhau' atmanapadi dividiginal metal
 is prakaar ‘yoga’ shabd kaa arth hua- samadhi arthath chitt vrittiyon kaa nirodh
 By the way, the word 'yoga' is also derived from 'yujir Yoga' and 'use restraint' metal, but then in this case the meaning of the word Yoga will be sum, addition and regulation respectively
 aage yoga main ham dekhenge ki aatma or paramatma ke vishay main bhi yoga kaha gaya he
 In the Gita, Shri Krishna has said at a place 'yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam'
 spasht he ki yah vaakya yoga kii paribhaasha nahin he
 Some scholars are of the opinion that the joining of the soul and the divine is called yoga
 is baat ko sweekaar karne main yah badi aapatti khadi hoti he ki baudhdhamtavlambee bhi, jo paramatma kii satta ko sweekaar nahin karte, yoga shabd kaa vyavhaar karte or yoga kaa samarthan karte hai
 The same can be said for the communists who consider the authority of God to be imperfect
 pantajali ne yogadarshan main, jo paribhaasha di he 'yogashchittavrittinirodeh', chitt kii vrittiyon ke nirodh kaa naam yoga he
 This sentence can have two meanings: Yoga is the name of the state of detention of the mind, or the remedy to bring this state is called Yoga
 parantu is paribhaasha par kai vidwaanon ko aapatti he
 He says that the name of the flow of Chittavaritas is Chitta
 purna nirodh kaa arth hoga chitt ke astitv kaa purna lop, chittashray samast smritiyon or sanskaron kaa ni:shesh ho janaa
 If this happens then it will not be possible to rise from the tomb
 kyonki us avasthaa ke sahare ke liye koi bhi sanskaar bachaa nahin hoga, praarabdh dagdh ho gaya hoga
 If possible, what will be the meaning of this sentence of Shri Krishna? Yogastha: Situated in Kuru Karmani, yoga and do karma
 viruddhavastha main karm ho nahin saktaa or us avasthaa main koi sanskaar nahin pad sakate, smritiyaan nahin ban saktin, jo samadhi se uthne ke baad karm karne main sahaayak hon
 In short, the meaning is that it is not very easy to understand the classical form of yoga, its philosophical basis, in a proper way
 sansar ko mithyaa maananevaala advaitavaadi bhi nididhyahn ke naam se uskaa samarthan karata he
 The Atheistic Sankhya scholar also approves it
 buddha hi nahin, muslim sufi or isai mistic bhi kisi na kisi prakaar apane sampradaay kii manyataon or darshanik siddhanton ke saath uskaa saamanjasy sthapit kar lete hai
 How can there be such coordination among these various philosophical ideologies that such a ground can be found on which the wall of yoga can be built, this is a very interesting question, but much time is needed for its discussion

 kai murtiyan jo saamaanya yoga yaa samadhi mudra ko pradarshit karti he, sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke sthaan par praapt huin he

 The Indus Valley Civilization is one of the major civilizations of the ancient river valley civilizations in the world
 jo mukhya rup se dakshin asia ke uttar-pashchimi kshetron main, jo aaj tak uttar purv afghanistan ,pakistan ke uttar-pashchim or uttar bharat main faili he
 Along with the ancient civilizations of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of the three earliest chronologies of the civilizations of the ancient world, and of these three, the most widespread and most discussed
 sammanit patrika nechar main prakashit shodh ke anusaar yah sabhyataa kam se kam 8000 varsh puraani he
 It is also known as the Harappan civilization and the 'indus-saraswati civilization'
 iskaa vikaas sindhu or ghaghghar / hakadaa ke kinare hua
 Mohenjodaro, Kalibanga, Lothal, Dholavira, Rakhigarhi and Harappa were its major centers
 disambar 2014 main bhirdana ko sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa ab tak kaa khoja gaya sabase pracheen nagar mana gaya he
 Archaeologists and historians based on the excavations in the British period have estimated that it was a highly developed civilization and these cities have been inhabited and destroyed many times
 7ve shatabdi main pehali baar jab logo ne punjab praant main ito ke liye mitti kii khudaai kii tab unhen vahaan se bani banaai ite mili jise logo ne bhagwaan kaa chamatkaar mana or unka upyog ghar banane main kiya uske baad1826 main charles mysen ne pehali baar is puraani sabhyataa ko khoja
 In 1856 Cunningham surveyed about this civilization
 1856 main karachi se lahore ke madhya railway line ke nirmaan ke dauraan bartan bandhuon dwaara hadappa sthal kii soochna sarkaar ko di
 In this sequence, in 1861, under the direction of Alexander Cunningham, the Archaeological Department of India was established
 1904 main lard karjan dwaara jon marshall ko bhartiya puratathvik vibhaag kaa mahanideshak banaaya gaya
 Fleet wrote an article about this old civilization
 1921 main dayaram saahani ne hadappa kaa utkhanan kiya
 Thus this civilization was named Harappan civilization and Dayaram Sahni was considered its explorer
 yah sabhyataa sindhu nadi ghati main faili hui thi isliye iskaa naam sindhu ghati sabhyataa rakhaa gaya
 Due to the rise of cities for the first time, it is also called the first urbanization
 pratham baar kaansya ke prayog ke kaaran ise kaansya sabhyataa bhi kaha jaataa he
 1400 centers of Indus Valley Civilization have been discovered, of which 925 centers are in India
 80 pratishat sthal saraswati nadi or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke aas-paas he
 So far only 3 percent of the total discoveries have been excavated
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa kshetra atyant vyapak tha
 Excavations at Harappa and Mohenjodaro have provided evidence of this civilization
 atah vidwaanon ne ise sindhu ghati kii sabhyataa kaa naam diya, kyonki yah kshetra sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra main aate hai, par baad main ropar, lothal, kalibanga, vanamali, rangapore aadi kshetron main bhi is sabhyataa ke avshesh mili jo sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra se baahar the
 Therefore, many historians consider it more appropriate to name this civilization as "harappan civilization", being the main center of this civilization
 bhartiya puraatatv vibhaag ke mahanideshak jon marshall ne 1924 main sindhu sabhyataa ke bare main teen mahatvapurn granth likhe
 The area of this civilization was many times larger and larger than the area of all ancient civilizations of the world
 is paripakv sabhyataa ke kendra-sthal punjab tathaa sindh main tha
 Subsequently, it expanded in the south and east direction
 is prakaar hadappa samskruti ke antargat punjab, sindh or baluchistan ke bhaag hi nahin, balki gujarat, rajasthan, haryana or pashchimi uttar pradesh ke seemaant bhaag bhi the
 Its spread ranged from Rahmandheri in the north to Daimabad in the south and Sutkagandor of Makran beach in Balochistan in the west to Meerut and Kurukshetra in the northeast
 praarambhik vistaar jo praapt tha usamen sampoorn kshetra tribhujaakar tha is tarah yah kshetra aadhunik pakistan se to bada he hi, pracheen misr or mesopotamia se bhi bada he
 In the third and second millennium BC, the area of any civilization throughout the world was not larger than the Harappan culture
 ab tak bhartiya upmahadweep main is samskruti ke kul 1000sthalon kaa pataa chal chukaa he
 Some of these are in the initial stage, some are in the mature stage and some are in the later stage
 paripakv avasthaa vaale kam jagah hi hai
 Only half a dozen of these can be called city
 inamen se do nagar bahut hi mahatvapurn hai - punjab kaa hadappa tathaa sindh kaa mohen jo dado 
 Both places are in present-day Pakistan
 dono ek duusare se 483 kimi dur the or sindhu nadi dwaara jude hue the
 The third city was Mohen, which was 130 km south of Daro, at the site of Chanhudaro and the fourth city at a place called Lothal above the Gulf of Khambhat in Gujarat
 iske atirikt rajasthan ke uttari bhaag main kalibanga tathaa haryana ke hisar jile kaa banaavali
 All these sites have views of mature and advanced Harappan culture
 sutkagendor tathaa surkotda ke samudratati nagaron main bhi is samskruti kii paripakv avasthaa dikhaai detii he
 The specialty of these two is to be a city fortress
 uttar hadappa avasthaa gujarat ke kathiyawad prayadweep main rangpur or rosedi sthalon par bhi pai gai he
 Charles Mann first came to know of this civilization in 1826
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke pramukh shahar teen deshon main is prakaar he:- The various cities of India have the following cities of the Indus Valley Civilization: - is sabhyataa kii sabase vishesh baat thi yahaan kii viksit nagar nirmaan yojana
 Both Harappa and Mohan Joddo had their fortifications where the family of the ruling class lived
 prayek nagar main durg ke baahar ek usase nimna str kaa shahar tha jahaan eenton ke makaanon main saamaanya log rahete the
 The special thing about these city buildings was that they were configured like traps
 yani sadake ek duusare ko samakon par katati thim or nagar anek ytaakar khandon main vibhakt ho jaataa tha
 This was applicable to all Indus settlements whether they were small or big
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado ke bhawan bade hote the
 The monuments there are proof that the rulers there were the ultimate skilled in labor mobilization and tax collection
 eenton kii badi-badi imaarat dekh kar saamaanya logon ko bhi yah lagegaa ki ye shaasha kitne pratapi or pratishthavan the
 By far the most famous site of Mohan Jodaro is the huge public bath, whose reservoir is in the mound of the fort
 yah into ke sthapaty kaa ek sundar udhaaharan he
 It is 11
88 meters long, 7
01 meters wide and 2
43 meters deep
 dono siron par tal tak jane kii seedhiyaan lagi hai
 There are change rooms next to the clothes
 snanagar kaa farsh paki eenton kaa bana he
 There is a big well in the nearby room whose water was taken out and put in hose
 hauz ke kone main ek nirgam he jisase pani bahakar naale main jaataa tha
 It is believed that this huge bath will be built for the religious bath which has traditionally been necessary for religious work in India
 mohan jodado kii sabase bada sanrachana he - anaaj rakhane kaa kothaar, jo 45
71 meter lanbaa or 15
23 meter chaudaa he
 Six rooms have been found in the fort of Harappa, which stand in two rows on a platform of bricks
 har ek kothaar 15
23 me
 lanbaa tathaa 6
09 me
 chaudaa he or nadi ke kinare se kuch ek meter kii duuri par he
 The floor area of these twelve units is about 838
125 square meters
 Which is almost as much as that of Mohan Jodro's storeroom
 hadappa ke kothaaron ke dakshin main khulaa farsh he or isapar do kataron main eent ke vrittakar chabutare bane hue hai
 Wheat and barley grains have been found in the cracks of the floor
 isse prathit hota he ki in chabutaron par fasal kii dawni hoti thi
 Two-room barracks have also been found in Harappa which were probably meant for laborers to live
 kalibangan main bhi nagar ke dakshin bhaag main eenton ke chabutare bane hai jo shaayad kothaaron ke liye bane honge
 Thus it is clear that Kothar was an integral part of the Harappan culture
 hadappa samskruti ke nagaron main eent kaa istemaal ek vishesh baat he, kyonki isi samay ke misr ke bhawanon main dhoop main sukhi eent kaa hi prayog hua tha
 The use of concrete bricks is found in contemporary Mesopatamia, but not on such a scale as in the Indus Valley Civilization
 mohan jodado kii jal nikaas pranali adbhut thi
 Almost every big or small house in every city had a courtyard and bath
 kalibangan ke anek gharon main apane-apane kuen the
 The water of the houses flowed to the streets where peacocks were made under them
 aksar ye moriyaan eenton or pathar kii silliyon se dhakin hoti thim
 In these peacocks of roads, softeners were also made
 sadakon or moriyon ke avshesh banaavali main bhi mili hai
 The economy of the Indus civilization was agrarian, but trade and animal husbandry were also in vogue
 aaj ke mukaable sindhu pradesh purv main bahut upjau tha
 In the fourth century BC, a historian of Sikandar said that Sindh was counted in the fertile regions of this country
 purv kaal main prakritik vanaspati bahut thim jiske kaaran yahaan acchhee varsha hoti thi
 The wood was used extensively for cooking bricks and building from the forests here, due to which the expansion of forests was gradually reduced
 sindhu kii urvartaa kaa ek kaaran sindhu nadi se prativarsh aane vaali baadh bhi thi
 a paved brick wall to protect the village indicates that floods used to come every year
 yahaan ke log baadh ke utar jane ke baad november ke maheene main baadh vaale maidaanon main beej bo dete the or agali baadh ke aane se pehle april ke maheene main gehun or jau kii fasal kaat lete the
 No shovel or fall has been found here, but from the prakrit-harappan civilization of Kalibangan, we have the impression that plows were plowed in Rajasthan during this period
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log genhu, jau, rai, matar, jowar aadi anaaj paidaa karte the
 They produced two varieties of wheat
 banaavali main mila jau unnat kism kaa he
 Apart from this, they also produced sesame and mustard
 sabase pehle kapaas bhi yaheen paidaa kii gai
 In the name of this, the people of Greece started saying this sign
 hadappa yonto ek krishi pradhan samskruti thi par yahaan ke log pashupaalan bhi karte the
 Bull-cow, buffalo, goat, sheep and boar were reared
 harappai logon ko hathi tathaa gande kaa gyaan tha
 Many businesses were prevalent in the cities here
 mitti ke bartan banane main ye log bahut kushal the
 Different types of paintings were made on pottery with black color
 kapadaa banane kaa vyavsaay unnat avasthaa main tha
 It was also exported abroad
 johari kaa kaam bhi unnat avasthaa main tha
 The work of making bead and amulets was also popular, yet no iron item has been found
 atah siddh hota he ki inhen lohe kaa gyaan nahin tha
 People here used to trade stones, metal scales etc
 among themselves
 ek bade bhubhag main dher sari sil, ekarup lipi or manakikrut maap taul ke pramaan mili hai
 He was familiar with the wheel and probably used a vehicle similar to today's aces
 ye afghanistan or iran se vyapaar karte the
 They established a commercial colony in northern Afghanistan that facilitated trade
 bahut si harappai sil mesopotamia main mili hai jinase lagata he ki mesopotamia se bhi unka vyapaar sambandh tha
 Evidences of trade with Meluha have been found in the records of Mesopotamia, as well as two intermediate trade centers - Dalmun and Maken
 dilamun kii pahchaan shaayad faras kii khadi ke bahrain ke kii ja sakati he
 It is clear that Harappa's developed city building system, the existence of large public baths and the trade relations with foreign countries would not have happened without any big political power, but there is no concrete evidence of how the rulers here were and what was the form of governance
 
 lekin nagar vyavastha ko dekhakar lagata he ki koi nagar nigam jaisi sthaneey swashaasan vaali sanstha thi
 Female statues of burnt clay have been found in Harappa in large numbers
 ek murti main stri ke garbh se nikalataa ek paudha dikhaaya gaya he
 According to scholars, it is a statue of the earth goddess and it must have been closely related to the birth and growth of plants
 isliye maaloom hota he ki yahaan ke log dharti ko urvartaa kii devi samajhate the or isaki puja usee tarah karte the jis tarah misr ke log nil nadi kii devi isis kii
 But like ancient Egypt, it is difficult to say whether the society here was also mother-dominated
 kuch vaidic sookhton main prithvi mata kii stuti he, dholavira ke durg main ek kuan mila he isamen neeche kii taraf jaati seedhiyaan he or usamen ek khidki thi jaha deepak jalaane ke saboot milte he
 The water of Saraswati river used to come in that well, so perhaps the people of Indus Valley used to worship Saraswati through that well
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nagaron main ek sil paaya jaataa he jisamen ek yogi kaa chitra he 3 yaa 4 mukh vaala, kai vidwaan maanate he ki yah yogi shiv he
 Mewar, which was once in the range of Indus Valley Civilization, is still worshiped here, Eklinganath ji, the incarnation of Shiva with four faces
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log apane shavon ko jalaayaa karte the, mohan jodado or hadappa jaise nagaron kii aabaadi kareeb 50 hazaar thi par phir bhi vahaan se keval 100 ke aasapaas hi kabre mili he jo is baat kii or ishaara karata he ve shav jalaate the
 Havan blunts have been found at Lothal, Kalibanga etc
, which is a proof of their being Vedic
 yahan swaastik ke chitra bhi mili he
 Some scholars believe that Hinduism was the original religion of Dravida and that Shiva was the god of Dravida whom the Aryans adopted
 kuch jain or buddha vidwaan yah bhi maanate he ki sindhu ghati sabhyataa jain yaa buddha dharm ke the, par mukhyadhara ke itihaaskaaron ne yah baat nakaar di or iske adhik pramaan bhi nahin he
 Archaeologists have found the remains of many temples in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia but no temple has been found in the Indus Valley till date, Marshall etc
 Many historians believe that the people of Indus Valley used to worship in their homes, fields or river banks, but Till date, only the Brihatnasan or the huge bathhouse is such a monument which is considered a place of worship
 jaise aaj hindu ganga main nahaane jate he vaise hi saindhav log yahan nahaakar pavitra hua karte the
 Yes yadhyapi is yug ke log pattharon ke bahut saare aujaar tathaa upkaran prayog karte the par ve kaanse ke nirmaan se bhalee bhaanti parichit the
 Metallurgists combined copper and tin to produce bronze
 haalanki yahaan dono main se koi bhi khanij prachur maatra main uplabdh nahin tha
 Cotton clothes were also woven
 log naav bhi banaate the
 Mudra constructing, making seven utensils of sculpture was also a major craft
 pracheen mesopotamia kii tarah yahaan ke logon ne bhi lekhan kala kaa avishkaar kiya tha
 The first specimen of the Harappan script was found in 1853 AD and the entire script came to light in 1923 but has not been read yet
 lipi kaa gyaan ho jane ke kaaran nijee sampatti kaa lekha-jokha aasaan ho gaya
 For the business, he needed a measuring weight and he also used it
 baat ke tarah kii kai vastuen mili hai
 They show that 16 or its repeaters were used in weights
 dilachasp baat ye he ki aadhunik kaal tak bharat main 1 rupaya 16 aane kaa hota tha
 There were 4 pavs in 1 kg and 4 kavas in each pav i

 There is a feeling that this civilization was in its last phase decadent

 Soil moisture is generally described as an aqueous element, θ { \ displaystyle \ theta} or saturation, s { \ displaystyle S}
 ye shabd θ = n s { \ displaystyle \ theta =ns} sameekaran ke madhyam se sanradhrata, n { \ displaystyle n} se sambandhit hai
 The change in soil moisture over time is known as the dynamics of soil moisture
 paristhitik jal vigyaan sambandhi siddhant samayik or sthanik sambandhon ko bhi mahatv detaa he
 Hydrology can be an important factor in the development of ecosystems over time, especially in precipitation events

 If vegetation is produced during the summer season, water stress is often experienced even if the total amount of rainfall has been in the right amount throughout the year
 Ecology has evolved in these areas to support grass-seeking grasses when water is accessible in winter, and drought-adapted trees when there is a shortage of water in summer
 paristhitik jal vigyaan kaa sambandh paudhon ke sthanik vitaran ke peeche jaleey karkon se bhi he

 ye prati din millimetre main die gaye hai 
 apvaah, vashpikaran or risaav sabhi ek nishchit samay par mitti kii santrupti par atyaadhik nirbhar karte hai
 To solve the equation, the evaporation-emission rate as a function of soil moisture must be known
 Generally, after a certain saturation according to the sample that describes it, evaporation will depend only on climatic factors such as available sunlight
 Upon reaching below this point, soil moisture controls evaporation and begins to decrease until the soil reaches a point where no more water is allowed for vegetation
 This level of soil is generally called the "permanent relaxation point"

 Early blood transfusions used whole blood, but modern medical systems typically use only blood components
 raktaadhan ke sambandh main pratham aitihaasik prayaas kaa sarvapratham varnan 17veen shatabdi ke itihaas lekhak stephano infesura ke dwaara kiya gaya
 Infesura discusses that, in 1492, when Pope Innocent VIII went into deep unconsciousness, the blood of three boys was poured into the dying Pope's body at the suggestion of a physician
 The boys were ten years old and were pledged to give one gold coin to each of them
 haalanki, na keval pope mar gaya, balki uske teen bachche bhi mar gaye
 Some writers accuse Infesura of being anti-papal and its description is not correct

 The first fully documented human transfusion was performed on June 15, 1967 by Dr
 Jean Baptiste Denis, the renowned physician of Emperor Louis XIV of France
 unhone ek bhend kaa raktaadhan ek 15 varsh ke ladke main kiya, jo raktaadhan ke baad jivit batch gaya
 Dennis also murders a laborer and he too survives
 donon udhaaharan sambhavat: rakt kii choti maatra ke kaaran the jiskaa vastav main in logon main raktaadhan kiya gaya tha
 This allowed them to face an allergic reaction
 Dennis's third patient undergoing blood transfusion was Swedish businessman Baron Bond
 unhone do aadhaan praapt kiye

 In the winter of 1667, Dennis infused Antoine Morroy several times with calf blood, who died a third time
 unki mrityu se ghire hue kai vivaad hai
 Morroy's wife firmly stated that Denise was responsible for her husband's death
 lekin moroy kii patni ko uski maut kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 Although it was later determined that Morroy actually died of arsenic poisoning, Dennis's experiments with animal blood sparked a heated controversy in France
 Eventually, in 1670, the process was banned
 sahi samay par, british sansad or yahaan tak ki pope ne bhi yahi kiya
 The blood transfusion went into oblivion for the next 150 years

 Karl Landsteiner's work made the determination of blood groups possible and thus paved the way for safely implementing blood transfusions
 For this discovery, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine in 1930
 jabaki pratham aadhaan sidhe daata se praptakarta main skandan ke pehle kiya gaya tha, 1910 main yah khoj kiya gaya ki skandanrodhi milakar or rakt ko thanda kar ise kuch dinon ke liye jamaana sambhav tha, jisase rakt bainkon ke liye maarg khul gaya

 Following the Bogdanov sample, the Soviet Union established a national system of blood banks in the 1930s
 News of the Soviet experience reached the United States, where in 1937, Bernard Fantus, director of medical medicine at the Cooke County Hospital in Chicago, founded the first hospital, the Blood Bank, in the United States
 At the time of establishing a hospital laboratory that preserved and deposited donor's blood, Fantas introduced the term "blood bank"

 It was due to Pandit Nehru's efforts that Mountbatten was made the first Governor General of independent India, while Jinnah refused to accept Mountbatten as the first Governor General of Pakistan, which Mountbatten had regretted all his life
 mountabeton 24 march 1947 se 30 june 1948 tak bharat main rahe
 In these fifteen months he was not only the constitutional head but also decisive of India's important policies

 The main proposal in this conference was to remove Maharaja Kashmir

 However, Pandit Nehru was stopped in Jammu before going to Srinagar

 francisi kranti france ke itihaas kii rajnatik or saamaajik uthal-puthal evam amul parivartan kii avadhi thi jo 1789 se 1799 tak chali
 Later, Napoleon Bonaparte carried this revolution to some degree by the expansion of the French Empire
 kranti ke falswaroop raja ko gaddi se hataa diya gaya, ek ganatantr kii sthapana hui, khooni sangharshon kaa daur chalaa, or antatah nepolian kii taanaashaahee sthapit hui jisase is kranti ke anekon mulyon kaa pashchimi europe main tathaa uske baahar prasar hua
 This revolution changed the direction of modern history
 isse vishwa bhar main nirpeksh rajtantr kaa hraas hona shuru hua, naye ganatantr ev udaar prajatantra bane
 In the modern era, the state revolution of France proved to be the most dramatic and complex in which the Western civilization shook Western civilization
 is kranti ne keval france ko hi nahin apitu samast europe ke jan-jivan ko ast-vyast kar diya
 The French Revolution has been called a milestone in the history of the entire world
 is kranti ne anya europea deshon main bhi swatantrata kii lalak kaayam kii or anya desh bhi rajshahi se mukti ke liye sangharsh karne lage
 This created an atmosphere against monarchy and autocracy in Asian countries, including European nations
 france main nirankush rajtantr tha jo rajtv ke daivi siddhanth par aadhaarit tha
 In this the king had unlimited rights and the king was arbitrary
 lui 14wein ke shasankaal main nirankushta apni paraakaashtha par thi
 He said- "I am the state"
 vah apni icchaanusaar kanoon banaata tha
 He made excessive centralization of power in favor of monarchy
 kootneeti or sainya kaushal se france kaa vistaar kiya
 In this way he made the monarchy a serious profession

 Louis was the 15th most luxurious, short-sighted and passive ruler
 austria ke uttaradhikaar yuddh evam saptavarshiya yuddh main bhaag lekar desh kii aarthik sthiti ko baari kshati pahunchaai
 Despite this, the Palace of Versailles remained a center of luxury
 usne kaha ki mere baad pralay hogi
 Louis was the ruler of the 16th on the eve of the revolution
 vah ek akarmanya or ayogy shaasha tha
 He too exhibited demeanor and autocracy
 usne kaha ki "yah cheez isliye kanoonee he ki yah main chahta hum
 "at the time of resignation of one of his ministers, he said - i wish i could resign

 Once when a procession of people was asking for bread, he advised that if bread is not available then why do people not eat cake

 Which was hereditary
 unki bhartee tathaa prashikshan ke koi niyam nahin the or in naukarshahon par bhi niyantran lagane vaali sanstha maujuud nahin thi
 Thus the system of governance was completely corrupt, autocratic, passive and exploitative
 vyaktigat kanoon or raja kii ichha kaa hi kanoon lagu hota tha
 As a result, there was a lack of uniform law code in the country and prevalence of different laws in different areas
 is avyavasthit or jatil kanoon ke kaaran janata ko apane hi kanoon kaa gyaan nahin tha
 The existence of this disorganized autocratic and sensitive governance system became painful for the people
 in utpeedak raajnneetik paristhitiyon ne kranti kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Regarding France's chaotic situation, u can be said that "there was no question of bad system, there was no system at all
" " The causes of the revolution can also be seen under social conditions
 francisi samaaj visham or vighatit tha
 That society was divided into three classes / states
 pratham stats main padri varg, dwitiya stats main kuleen varg evam tritiy stats main jansadharan shaamil tha
 The clergy and the nobility enjoyed wide privileges while the public was devoid of authority
 kisaanon kii sankhya sarvaadhik thi or inaki dasha nimna or sochneey thi
 The peasants had to pay many taxes to the state, the church and other zamindars and the feudal tyrants had to bear
 ek drushti se kisaanon ke asantosh kaa mukhya kaaran saamanton dwaara die ja rahe ksht evam asuvidhaayen thi or rajtantr is par chuppi saadhe hue tha
 In this way, the peasants had become so grieved that they themselves turned into a revolutionary element and they needed only a sign to make revolution
 madhyam varg main sahukaar vyapaaree, shikshak, vakil, doctor, lekhak, kalakaar, karmchaaree aadi sammilit the
 His economic condition was certainly right, yet he was angry with the political, social and economic conditions of the time
 is varg ko koi raajnneetik adhikaar praapt nahin tha or padri or kuleen varg kaa vyavhaar inke prati acha nahin tha
 For this reason the middle class hated the social superiority of the nobles and was willing to change the political system and get their rights
 yahi kaaran tha ki france kii kranti main unka mukhya yogadan rahaa or unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 There were also some economic complaints from the middle class
 purv ke vaanijya vyapaar ke kaaran is varg ne dhansampatti arjeet kar lee thi kintu ab saamanti vaataavaran main unke vyapaar par kai tarah ke pratibandh lage the jagah-jagah chungi deni padati thi
 They wanted a free environment for their trade business
 iske liye unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 In this way we can say that the French Revolution was the result of the struggle of two conflicting factions of French society
 ek taraf raajnneetik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee or duusari taraf aarthik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee varg the
 To dominate the politics and government of the country, struggle between these two classes was inevitable
 is tarah 1789 kii francisi kranti, francisi samaaj main asamanta ke viruddh sangharsh thi
 The economic condition of France was in trouble
 rajya diwaliyapan ke kagaar par pahunch gaya tha
 In fact the royal treasury was emptied due to the extravagance of the kings of France and the frequent wars of Louis the 14th

 An excessive amount of the state was spent on the emperor, empress and his family

 On the other hand the tax system was unsatisfactory
 visheshadhikaron ke kaaran sampann varg kar se mukt tha tathaa garib kisaan jo aarthik drushti se vipann tha, ekmaatr karadaata tha
 In this way the state of the treasury had become extremely thoughtful

 The state was burdened with debt
 mul dhan kii to baat hi kya france byaaj chukaane main asamarth tha arthath rajya divaaliepan kii sthiti main pahunch gaya tha
 The country's economic malpractices could be improved by encouraging trade commerce, but the government's commercial policy was so uncontrolled and flawed that it did not make possible the development of production and trade in the state
 lui 16wein ne turgon, nekar jaise vitt salaahkaaron ke madhyam se aarthik sankat ko dur kanane kaa prayaas kiya lekin ye sudhaar prayaas lagu nahin ho sake kyonki visheshadhikaar praapt varg ne apane upar kar lagane kii baat sweekaar nahin kii
 The demand for a meeting of the estate general was eventually called for passing resolutions for the abolition of privilege, and the revolution coincided with the meeting of the estate general in 1789, so the economic plight of the time was considered the most important cause of the French Revolution is
 francisi kranti main darshanikon kii bhoomika ke sandarbh main do mat saamne aate hai-ek, darshanikon ne kranti kii paristhitiyon ko janm dekar kranti ko utpann kiya or doosraa kranti kaa strot to us samay ke rashtriya jivan ke dosha main tathaa sarkaar kii bhuulon main tha or darshanikon ne kranti utpann nahin kii
 It would be desirable to understand the views of those philosophers and their relationship with the revolution before passing judgment on any opinion
 darshanikon ke vichaaron kii lokapriyata kaa nirdhaaran to us samay unke chape lekhon ke sanskarnon or prasar ke aadhaar par dekha janaa chahie
 Montescue in his book 'the Spirit of Laws' contradicted the principles of the king's divine rights and offered not only a critique of French political institutions but also an alternative
 usne likhaa ki francisi sarkaar nirkunsh sarkaar he kyonki france main karypalika, nyaaypalika or vidhayika sambandhi sabhi shaktiyaan ek hi vyakti arthath raja ke haathon main kendrit he isliye france kii janata ko swatantraaa praapt nahin he
 It was in this context that he gave the principle of "separation of power", according to which the three principal organs of governance, the executive, the judiciary and the administrator, were advised to be placed in separate hands
 usne england ke saraakar ko adarsh bataaya kyonki vahaan sanvaidhanik rajtantr tha jisase vahaan nagarikon ko swatantraaa thi
 Thus his ideas that Montescue hurt France's autocratic state system through segregation of power became so popular that six editions were published in three years of 'the Spirit of Lodges'
 yahaan dhyaan rakhane kii baat yah he ki montescue ne na to kranti kii baat kii or na hi rajtantr ko samaapt karne kii usne to sirp nirankush rajtantr ke dosha ko ujagar kiya or sanvaidhanik rajtantr kii baat kii
 Voltaire illustrated the liberal politics, religion and freedom of thought of Britain through his book Letters on English and compared it to the ancient French system and noted the evils and shortcomings prevalent in France
 pratibandhit hone se purv ye pustaken bahut lokapriy hui thi
 "voltaire" wrote against the Church's corrupt pickles, intolerance, injustice, oppression and tyranny

 He wrote that crush the notorious and infamous thing
 yah spasht rup se france ke nirankush rajtantr evam carch ke atyaachaar par prahaar tha
 Waltair wanted to establish a similar rule in France, in line with the constitutional monarchy of England
 usne kaha ki main sau chuhon ke sthaan par ek singh kaa shashan pasand karata hoon
 Voltaire did not speak of revolution but laid the background for freedom of thought
 usne puraatan francisi vyavastha kii buraaiyon ko ujagar kiya
 He presented to the people the mirror of the erstwhile French society and said that the mirror is called a stain
 ruso ne apni pustak “emily”, “soshal contract”, “rusoni” ke madhyam se manushya kii swatantraaa kii baat kii
 It said that despite being born free of human beings, everyone is chained with chains
 in zanjeeron se mukti paane kaa ek hi tarika he ki ham prakritik aadim avasthaa kii ore laute
 The Russians said that it is the compulsory and universal duty of a state made by collective will to conduct the work considering the whole society as paramount
 jin logon ko karypalika shakti saupin gai he ve janata ke swami nahin uske kaaryakari he, or unka kartavya janata kii ajna kaa paalan karnaa he
 In this way he firmly believed that the paramount power should be in the hands of the public and not in the hands of any individual or institution
 saarvbhaum satta janata kii ichha main nihit he jise “saamaanya ichha” kaha gaya
 The law of the state should be an expression of this common desire, but the nature of the law is no longer such, but it is dependent on the will of the ruler
 ruson ne bhi kranti kii baat nahin kii lekin sabhi vyakti ko swatantra evam samaan mana or francisi kranti ke naare swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav usee ke vichaaron se prabhavit the
 Napoleon acknowledged his importance and said that if there had not been the Russians, there would not have been a revolution in France

 The French scholar Didro is credited with compiling the works of the best thinkers of the 18th century and bringing them to the general public

 The French government considered the Daiders to be its greatest enemy and imposed several restrictions on his book

 He argued that only land is the primary source of all wealth

 By the time of the 16th, the French financial system had sunk into debt
 america swatantraaa sangram ne france ke divaaliepan par muhar laga di
 Therefore, in order to overcome the economic distress, the help of economists like Turks, Necker, Cologne took
 colon ne visheshadhikaar praapt kuleen varg par kar lagane kaa suzav diya jise kulinon ne asweekaar kar diya
 The meeting of the States General was finally called

 All classes were excited to hear the news of the meeting of the States General
 kulina ummid thi ki is baithak main ve un visheshadhikaron ko praapt kar sakenge jo lui 14waan ke samay usne chhin liye gaye the
 The people of the middle class believed that they would be able to formulate progressive policies in their favor
 kisaanon ko aashaa thi ki vah saamanti visheshadhikaron ke viruddh aawaaj uthaakar apane adhikaron ko surakshit kar unke shoshan chakra se mukt ho sakenge
 In this way no significant portion of the French population was ready to support the French monarchy
 estats general ke adhiveshan main matadhikaar paddati ke mudde par tritiy state evam anya state ke bich vivaad ho gaya
 Voting was said that each state would be considered to have only one vote
 is prakaar visheshadhikaar praapt varg kaa do tathaa jansadharan kaa ek hi mat hota he
 Representatives of the general public, ie 'third State' opposed this voting system because it would have reduced them to a minority even though they were many
 tritiy state yah chahta tha ki teenon shreniyon ke pratinidhi ek saath baithkar bahumat se nirnay le lekin padri evam kuleen varg alag-alag baithak chaahate the
 Therefore, the Third State boycotted the meeting of the States General and declared itself as a national assembly, representing the entire nation and convened its meeting in the nearby tennis court
 francisi kranti vibhinn charnon se hote hue apane mukaam tak pahunchi
 From the point of view of convenience of the study, the revolution can be seen by dividing it into the following four stages
 is charan main paris kii bheed ne bastil ke kile par niyantran sthapit kiya
 This is how the revolution started
 vastutah bastil kaa kila nirankushta evam atyaachaar kaa pratik tha or iske patan se puraatan vyavastha kaa gahari chunauti mili
 The incident also affected the rural areas of France and the villagers set fire to the records of feudal taxes
 janata kii in kaarywahiyon kaa rashtriya sabha par bhi gaharaa asar padaa
 So, on 4 August 1789, an overnight session of the National Assembly took place in which all the privileges were abolished by framing laws
 is tarah england or america ko samaapt kar diya gaya
 The important function of the National Assembly was to create a constitution
 atah rashtriya sabha hi samvidhan sabha kahalaayi or 26 agast 1789 ko samvidhan sabha ne maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 The Constituent Assembly declared human rights as its ideals and objectives
 is ghoshnaa main samanta ke siddhanth par bal diya gaya or kaha gaya ki chunki sabhi manushya samaan rup se paidaa hote he atah unhen samaan adhikaar milane chahie
 These rights included freedom, property security and the right to protest against tyranny etc
 is prakaar samvidhan sabha ne aadharbhoot siddhanton, swatantraaa, samanta va janata ke prabhutv kii ghoshnaa kii
 The right to property was repeated in the manifesto
 is adhikaar se kisi ko vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 The National Constituent Assembly seized church property and attempted to reduce the church's control over the public
 is sandarbh main carch ko rajya ke adheen le aayaa gaya or use rome ke pope ke prabhaav se mukt kar rashtriya carch ke rup main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 a "civil Constitution of Clergy" was created to secure the clergy's loyalty to the state
 jiske anusaar padariyon ko rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath leni padati thi or janata ke dwaara unka chunaav hota tha
 The pope and some priests opposed the move
 jin padariyon ne rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath grahan ki ve “jurar” kehalaae jabaki shapath nahin lene vaale “non jurar” kehalaae
 This law created an atmosphere against the revolution because so far the small clergy had supported the revolution
 ab ve isse alag ho gaye or kuch padri desh chhod videshon main chale gaye or vahaan europe main kranti ke viruddh prachaar karne lage
 The National Constituent Assembly prepared a written constitution for France, and this constitution was approved by Louis XVI in 1791
 samvidhan main do baton par bal diya gaya-ek, rajya kii saarvbhaum shakti janata main nihit he or doosraa, shakti kaa pruthakkaran rajya evam janata ke hit main he
 Although the system of governance remained monarchical, the king's powers were limited
 ab vah kanoon nirmaataa nahin rahaa
 The king did not have the right to make war or treaty with any country
 kanoon banane kaa adhikaar ek vyavasthapika sabha ko diya gaya or uske sadasyon kii sankhya 745 thi
 The citizens were divided into two parts, active and inactive, for the election of members of the administration and the franchise was given only to the active citizens
 sakriy naagarik 25 varsh se adhik aayu ke ve log the jo rajya ko teen din kii aay ke baraabar pratyaksh kar dete the jabaki niskriy naagarik ve the jo garib the
 The National Assembly changed the administrative structure of France
 pracheen praanto ko khatm karke sampoorn desh ko 83 departmenton main vibhakti kiya gaya
 These departments were divided into Cantan and Comune
 prayek ikaiyon kaa shashan chalaane ke liye nirvachan parishad hoti thi jiskaa chunaav sakriy naagarik karte the
 In this way, the entire state system from the local level to the central level came to the Barja class

 Radicals were also divided into two classes - Jirondist and Jacobian
 isi bich france kii kranti kaa bhay europe ke anya deshon ke bhi failane laga
 The clergy and oligarchs who had fled from France to other regions of Europe spread the spirit against the revolution
 duusari taraf france ke krantikari anya deshon main bhi krantikari siddhanton ko prachaar chaah rahe the
 As a result, other kings of Europe became suspicious
 parinamswaroop krantikari france or europe ke anya deshon kaa aapasi sambandh bigadaa
 Austria, despite the refusal of the revolutionaries, had allowed the refugees of the French monarchy to remain with them
 atah vyavasthapika sabha ne apairal 1792 i
 main austria ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar di, kintu france kii sena buree tarah parajeet hui
 The defeat convinced the French people that the king had told Austria all the secrets of France's military power and security
 atah raja ke prati janata kaa ravaiya ugr ho gaya
 In these conditions, in support of the French monarchy, Prasha and Austria declared that the French people should obey the king, otherwise we will take action against them
 is tarah france kii kranti ne europe main yuddh kii sthiti utpann kii
 The announcement made the people of France more enraged and surrounded the king
 raja bhagkar vyavasthapika sabha kii sharan main pahunchaa
 It was now considered that the assembly should be dissolved; a re-election takes place, a new administrative assembly is formed and it gives its decision on the future of monarchy
 isi ke saath vyavasthapika sabha ko samaapt kar diya gaya or vayask matadhikaar ke aadhaar par rashtriya kanveshan kaa gathan hua
 The first session of the National Convention was held on 21 September 1792
 isamen jacobiyan evam jirodist dal pramukh the
 The Jacobians were disciplined and organized
 paris kii bheed par inkaa prabhaav tha
 The main leaders in this were - Dante, Robspier, Heater, etc
 duusari taraf jirondist the- ye shikshit or susanskrit log the
 He had more book knowledge
 faltah ye vyaavhaarik raajnneetijna nahin the
 The prominent leaders were - Isnar, Madame Roland, Brisco etc
 yahaan samajhane kii baat yah he ki donon hi gut ganatantr ke himachati the, videshi shaktiyon ke viruddh yuddh kaa samarthan karte the
 The difference was only in form
 vastutah jirodisto ne france main udaaravaadi sthaan grahan kar liya tha
 He believed that the revolution had gone far ahead and should end
 ve or adhik saamaajik samanta laane ke viruddh the
 He emphasized more on freedom
 udhar jacobiyan log samanta par adhik jor dete the tathaa nimna virgon ke prati sadbhaavpurn ravaiya rakhte the
 The National Convention had three major problems - foreign invasion, the king's presence, and civil war
 sitambar 1792 main francisi sena ne belgium par adhikaar kar liya or dakshin main nise or sevoy bhi uske adhikaar main aa gaye
 Holland, Austria, Prasha and England were terrified by these victories
 krantikariyon ne 1792 main ghoshnaa bhi kar di ki france kaa ganatantr swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kii bhaawanaaon par aadhaarit he or in bhaawanaaon kaa prasar karnaa vah apana kartavya samajhataa he
 France will implement revolutionary principles and seize the property of priests and nobles in the places where it will dominate and whichever country opposes it will be considered as the revolution
 is ghoshnaa se europe ke nirankush rajtantri desh bhaybheet ho gaye or ab france kii kranti france kii na hokar puure europe kii ho gai
 Therefore, the European countries united to stop the spread of revolution and a faction of England, Holland, Austria, Prussia was formed against France
 is gut ne kai jagahon par france ko parajeet kiya
 Consequently, France's defeat in a foreign war became a major problem before the National Convention
 neshnal kanvension ne ek prastaav paarit kar rajtantr ko samaapt kiya or ganatantr kii sthapana kii
 The king was tried for treason and sentenced to death
 raja ke vadh ke prashn par jirondixton kii niti spasht nahin thi
 He was opposed to the monarchy but was referring to the referendum on the question of slaughter
 iske vipareet jacobiyans kaa mat tha ki raja kaa deshadroh siddh ho chukaa he
 Therefore, he should be given death sentence
 atantah 21 janvari 1793 ko lui 16waan faansee par chadha diya gaya
 The National Convention also faced the problem of conflict between the Jacobians and the Zirodists
 vastutah yuddh ke kaaran france aarthik sankat se ghir gaya tha, keemten bad gai thi jisase kanveshan ne raahat dene ke liye vidhaan banaaya, amiron se karj vasuulne kaa niyam banaaya
 These steps were opposed by the Jirandists
 jab jacobio ne paris kii bheed or commune kii sahaayta se kanvension par akraman kar satta par adhikaar kiya or jirondixto ko giraftaar kar aatank ke rajya kii sthapana kii
 With the establishment of the 'state of Terror', France once again fell into disarray
 robspier ke netritv main isaki sthapana kii gai thi
 In this revolutionary, public security was established and anyone who worked against the Jacobs would be punished with death penalty
 robspier ruson kii vichaardhaara se prabhavit tha
 According to which "common desire" is universal desire
 robspier ne satta par niyantran rakhane ke liye virodhiyon ko “gilotin” par chadha diya
 So all the people became suspicious about their lives
 antat july 1794, main robspier kaid kar liya gaya or faansee de di gai isi ke saath aantak ke rajya kii samaapti hui
 The 'state of Thermidorians' was followed by the state of terror
 udaaravaadi thermidorian netaaon ne desh kii satta sanbhali or aantak rajya kii vyavasthaaon ko bhang kiya, jacobiyans ko avaidh ghoshit kiya
 During the rule of terror, control over the price and remuneration imposed was lifted
 jisase keemten punah bad gai, sattebaajon kaa prabhaav bad gaya or pratikriya swaroop vidroh hue lekin in vidronho ko dabaa diya gaya
 Phase III-1794-99 - Rule of "directory" In fact the National Convention formulated a constitution and entrusted the executive responsibility to the 5-member "board of Directors"
 mandal ke sabhi sadasyon ke adhikaar baraabar the
 Each member alternately presided for three months
 prayek varsh ek sadsy kaarykaal samaapt hona tha or uske badale duusare sadsy kii niyukti kii jaani thi
 In this way, the Directory of Rule in France began after the National Convention which lasted from 1795 to 1799
 atan main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kar diya
 This directory rule was disorganized, sad
 sanchaalak mandal ko sashastr senaaon ke niyantran evam senadhyakshon kii niyukti, france kii ore se sandhi karne yaa yuddh karne ke adhikaar praapt the
 The main problem before the Board of Directors was the problem of war, on the other hand the members of the directory were inexperienced, inept and corrupt
 atah diarectory ke shashan kaal main tarah-tarah kii gadabadi faili, bekaari badi, vyapaar thapp pad gaya or uski videsh niti bhi kamjor rahi
 In such a situation, the people of France felt the need for a ruler who could establish peace inside and outside the country and defeat foreign powers
 is kaal main nepolian ne sainya vijayon dwaara france ke sammaan ko sthapit kiya or antat diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kar satta par niyantran sthapit kiya
 In 1799, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule and became the first Council of France and declared himself Emperor in 1804 and thus Napoleon's dictatorial imperialist rule began
 europe main france hi vah desh he jisane kranti ke madhyam se puraatan vyavastha ke patan ko sunishchit kiya
 The impact of this revolution was not limited to Europe
 isane samast vishwa ko prabhavit kiya
 The slogans of revolution spread freedom, equality and fraternity throughout Europe
 ek taraf isane jahaan rashtrawaad, janatantrwaad jaisi nai shaktiyon ko panpane kaa mauka diya to duusari taraf aadhunik taanaashaahee or sainikwaad kii neenv bhi daali
 The effects of the French Revolution can be understood under the following points: francisi kranti kii prakruti ko kranti ke aadarshon, kranti ke netritv, kranti kii pragati, kranti ke dauraan laae gaye parivartanon or vishwa par pade prabhaavon ke prakaash main samajhe jane kii jarurat he
 From this point of view, the revolution was a revolution that was started by the elite, then later it came into the hands of the middle class
 kuch samay ke liye yah krantikari tatwon ke prabhaav main rahi or ant ek sainik taanashaah ke saath hua
 In this way, the French Revolution started like a huge river that started from the high mountain peak and crossed several small mountains in the path, at a rapid, if slow, speed
 1789 main hui francisi kranti ko ek burjua kranti ke rup main dekha ja sakaata he
 The leadership in the first phase of the revolution was in the hands of the bourgeois elements of the Third State
 madhyavargeey netritv ne nijee sampatti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kuch siddhanth bhi banaaen
 In fact, the end of feudalism was declared but feudal rights were not only abandoned, but only after compensating the landlords, the peasants could be relieved of any responsibility
 maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa main madhyavargeey prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 The right to property was placed in the category of natural rights of man which is related to the protection of bourgeois interests
 isi prakaar vayask matadhikaar kii baat to kii gai kintu samvidhan main “naagarik” shabd kaa atyant sankuchit arthon main prayog kiya gaya
 Citizens were divided into active and passive citizens
 sakriy naagarik ve the jo apni kam se kam teen din ke aay kii rakam pratyaksh kar ke rup main adaa karte the or sirp inhen hi mat dene kaa adhikaar tha
