85 Sarai Madan is a village in Phulpur, Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh
 vatsa yaa vansh yaa bats yaa bansh pracheen bharat ke 16 mahajanapadon main se ek tha
 It was centered around modern Allahabad
 uttarpurv main yamuna kii tatavarti bhoomi isamen sammilit thi
 Kaushambi was its capital 30 miles away from Allahabad
 vatsa ko vatsa desh or vatsa bhoomi bhi kaha gaya he
 Its capital Kaushambi was located on the Yamuna, 38 miles southwest of Allahabad
 mahabharat ke yuddh main vatsa log pandavon ke paksh se lade the
 The origin of Vatsadesh is related to the Chandravanshi kings of Kashi
 kaashi ke raja divodas ke putr kaa naam vatsa tha
 His main village was Dumayat but he was also known by the names Pratardana, Ritudhwaja and Kuvalayashva
 brahmad evam vaayu puraanon main vatsa or pratardan ko ek na kahkar vatsa ko pratardan kaa putr kaha gaya he
 Vatsa increased the influence of the Kashi kingdom and conquered the territories near Kaushambi, which became known as Vatsa or Vatsa Bhumi
 prasiddh samrat alerk isi vatsa kaa putr tha
 In the Shatapatha Brahmin, the name of Proti Kaushambay is described by commentator Hariswamin as a resident of Kaushambi
 yaheen vatsa rajya kii rajdhani kaa sarvapratham ullekh he
 With the influence of Kashi, the history of the separate Vatsas begins from the time of Kuruvanshi Nichakshu
 arjuna ke pautra or parakshit ke putr janamejay the
 Janamejaya was followed by Shataniks, Ashwamedhadatta, Adhisam Krishna and Nichakshu in the lineage
 ganga kii baadh se hastinapur ke nasht ho jane par janamejay ne kaushambi main apana rajya sthapit kiya
 In this way, the kingdom of Vatsa was ruled by the Pour and Bharat dynasty
 puraanon main nichakshu ke baad 23 raajaaon ke naam aate hai
 Most of these are nominal for us
 yah sambhav he ki is talika main kuch naam un rajkumaron ke bhi hon jo singhaasana par nahin baithe the; kuch samakaleen nareshon ko anuvarthi batalaakar or upashakhaon ke kuch raajaaon ko bhi mukhya vansh main jodakar talika main vruddhi kii gai ho
 The first of these kings, about whom we know certain things, is the second satanic of the Puranas, which was also known as Parantap
 puraanon main uske pita kaa naam vasudan, kintu bhaas ke anusaar sahasranik, tha
 He married a princess of Videha
 usne ang ke naresh dadhivaahan kii rajdhani champa par akraman kiya tha
 It is clear that there was a significant increase in the influence and importance of the Vatsa state during the time of Satanic Parantap
 shatanik kaa rajyakaal 550 i
 pus
 ke lagbhag rakhaa ja saktaa he
 The name of Vatsa or Vansa also appears in the table of sixteen Mahajanapadas of the sixth century BCE
 is rajvansh kii sarvocch unnati shatanik ke putr udayan ke samay main hui thi
 It is said that he was born on the same day as Gautama Buddha
 itnaa to nishchit he ki vah buddha kaa samakaleen tha or apane samay ke pramukh vyaktiyon main se ek tha
 Its capital Kaushambi was counted among the major cities of northern India due to its prosperity
 isi prakaar vatsa rajya uttari bharat ke chaar bade rajyon main se ek ke rup main pratishthit hua tha
 It is clear from the many wonderful stories about Udayana that the impression of his personality was deep on his contemporary society
 kalidas ne apane meghdoot main avanti ke udayan-katha kovid gramvridhon kaa ullekh kiya he
 The names of many of her queens are found in Udyan related legends
 ye vaivaahik sambandh uske raajnneetik prabhaav evam kushal niti ke parichaayak hai
 The story of his love and marriage with Rajkanya Vasuldatta of Avanti Naresh Pradyot is given in the Dhammapada story
 uski anya raniyaan thim, samavati, kuru ke ek brahman kii putree magandiya tathaa magadh naresh darshak kii bahan padmavati
 The delighted Priyadarshika mentions her marriage to Aranyaka, the daughter of Angnaresh Stadivarman
 ratnavali main vaasavadatta kii paricharika sagarika ke saath uske prem kii katha he
 The boundaries of Udayan's empire are not known
 kintu sambhavat: uskaa rajya ganga or yamuna ke dakshin main tha or purv main magadh tathaa pashchim main avanti se isaki seemayen mili thim
 According to Harsha's Priyadarshika, Udayan conquered Kalinga and re-established his brother-in-law firm on the throne of Anga
 kathasaritsagar main uski digvijay kaa vishad varnan he
 But it is difficult to find historical truth in these details
 ek jataka katha se prathit hota he ki sunsumargiri ke bhagg logon kaa rajya bhi vatsa rajya ke adheen tha
 Udayana was initially against Buddhism
 usne nashe main cruddh main hokar ek baar pindol naam ke bhikshu ko utpeedit kiya tha kintu baad main pindol ke prabhaav ke kaaran hi vah buddha kaa anuyaayi bana
 It was but natural that the dynasty of Vatsa and Avanti should become mutual enemies in the competition of their power, but even during the lifetime of Udayan, Avantineresh Pradyot could not dare to attack Vatsaraja
 kalantar main, aisa prathit hota he ki vatsa rajya avanti rajya ke prabhaav main aakar usee main mil gaya
 In the Puranas, after Udyan, the list of kings of Vatsa ends with the names of Vahinar, Dandapani, Nirmitra and Kshemak
 in raajaaon ke vishay main hamen kuch bhi gyaat nahin he
 Of these, Vahinar is probably mentioned in a Jataka by the name of Bodhikumar and in Kathasaritsagara by the name of Narvahana
 puraanon ke anusaar kshemak ke saath vatsa ke rajvansh kaa ant hua
 With the victory of the Avanti kingdom by Magadha King Shishunag, the Vatsa state also became part of the Magadha kingdom

 Groups of multiple units were used in the old metric system
 SI ko 1960 main puraani meter-kilogram-sacond yani pranali se viksit kiya gaya tha, bajaay centimetre-gram-sacond pranali kii, jisamen kai kathinaaiyaan thim
 The SI system does not remain stable, but it continues to evolve, but units are created and changed only through international agreements
 yah pranali lagbhag vishwavyapak str par lagu he or adhikansh desh iske alaava anya ikaayiyon kii aadhikarik paribhaashaayen bhi nahin samajhate hai
 But exceptions are the United States and Britain, where non-si units still have their old systems
 bharat mein yah pranali 1 april, 1957 mein lagu hui
 Along with this, new money was also introduced here, which was based on the decimal system itself
 is pranali main kai nai namakaran kii gai ikaiyaan lagu hui
 There are seven basic units in this system and many other derived units
 kuch vaigyanik or saanskrithik kshetron main es ai pranali ke saath anya ikaiyaan bhi prayog main laai jaati hai
 It is easy to express very small and very large quantities through SI prefixes
 kisi ikai kii paribhaasha or karyanvan ke bich antar mahatvapurn he
 The definition of each SI root unit has been carefully designed to be unique and unique, and at the same time presents a solid theoretical basis on which the most accurate and reproducible measurements can be made

 How definitions of certain critical units are implemented is given on the BIPM website
 An SI derived unit unique form is defined only as SI root units

 Based on the results of this study, the Tenth CGPM decided in 1954 to derive an international system from six basic units that could provide measurements of mechanical and electromagnetic quantities as well as temperature and optical radiation
 anumodith kii gayi chah mul ikaiyaan thim meter, kilogram, sacond, ampear, degree calvin evam kandela
 In 1960, the 11th CGPM named the system the International System of Units or the International System of Units, abbreviated as SI, originally from French: Le Système international d'unités
 The seventh parent unit, the mole or the mole, was added to the 14th CGPM in 1971

 The metric system has received worldwide support as a means of means and daily commerce
 iskaa kaaran bahut had tak yah bhi tha ki kai deshon main rudhigat pranaaliyon main kai siddhanton ko samajhane kaa samarthy nahin thi
 At the same time, by standardizing regional changes, a world-wide system, which is universally accepted, was created
 isse anterrashtriya vyapaar ko bhi badhaava mila
 From a scientific point of view, the use of decimal can also be described as very large and very small units

 In many cases this change is BIPM
 Is also valid by Some examples include: The European Union has given a directive that prohibits the sale of non-si marked goods from 31 December 2009 onwards
 yah sabhi utpaadon, sanlagn nirdeshon or kaagajon, packing tathaa vigyapanon par lagu hota he
 But on 11 September 2007, the EU declared that the UK was exempted from this directive and that their imperial system would still be infinitely valid, along with the metric system

 Many supporters do not argue that everything should be privatized
 unke mutabik, bazaar kii vifaltaa or prakritik ekadhikaar samasyajanak ho sakate hai
 However, some Austrian ideological economists and anarchic-bourgeoisie want that every function of the state, including defense and dispute resolution, should be privatized
 nijeekaran ke liye buniyadi aarthik tark yah diya jaataa he ki apane udhyamon ko sunishchit rup se acchhee tarah chalaane ke liye sarkaron ke paas bahut hi kam protsaahan hote hai
 In state monopolies, lack of comparison is a problem
 tulana karne ke liye pratiyogi ke upasthit na hone se, yah kahana bahut kathin hota he ki udhyam kushal he yaa nahin
 Secondly, the central government administration and the voters who elected them have difficulty evaluating the potential of so many and different enterprises

 haalanki, is se ghate kii purti ke liye sarkaar ko karon se praapt dhan ko isamen lagane kii jarurat nahin rahegi
 The proponents of privatization make the following arguments: nijeekaran ke virdohi is aadhaar par ki sarkaar pratinidhi maalik hone ke naate logon ke prati javabdeh hoti he, saarvajanik sevaaon ko acchhee tarah chalaane ke liye sarkaar ke paas protsaahanon kii kami hone ke daawey kaa virodh karte hai
 It has been argued that the government which runs nationalized enterprises poorly will lose the support and votes of the people, while the governments that run the enterprises well will get the support and votes of the people
 Thus, democratic governments also have incentives in the form of increasing maximum efficiency in nationalized companies due to the pressure of future elections
 nijeekaran ke kuch virodhiyon kaa maananaa he ki kuch saarvajanik vastuon or sevaaon ko mukhya rup se sarkaar ke haath main rahanaa chahie taaki yah sunishchit kiya ja sake ki samaaj ke prayek vyakti kii un tak pahunch ho sake 
 isi tarah, kuch nijee vastuon or sevaaon ko nijee kshetra ke haathon main rahanaa chahie
 When the government provides public goods and services to society at large, there is a positive externality, such as defense and disease control
 Due to their nature for natural monopoly they are not subject to fair competition and it is better to administer them by the state

 Many privatization opponents have also warned against the corruption trend inherent in the process
 kai kshetra jo sarkaar pradaan kar sakati he, anivaary rup se labharahit hai, ek tarika jisase nijee companiyaan unamem kaam kar saken, vah anubandh yaa bhugtan rokane ke madhyam se ho saktaa he
 In these cases, the performance of the private firm in a particular project will be removed from their performance and profit can be maximized by measures of embezzlement and hazardous cost cutting

 Reconstruction of the infrastructure of a war-torn country, for example, requires a private firm to either hire a security that would certainly be limited and complicate their operations, or the government's Coordination has to be done, which can be very difficult due to the lack of a shared command framework between the firm and the government
 duusari taraf ek sarkari agency ke paas suraksha ke liye bulaane ko puri sena he, jisaki kaman shrinkhalaa spasht rup se paribhaashit he
 Opponents say this is a false claim: how many books have references to weak organizations between government departments

 soochna kii vishmata ke kaaran ek sheersh kaaryakari aasaani se ek sampatti ke anumaanit mulya ko kam kar saktaa he
 By accelerating the accounting of projected expenses, delaying the accounting of projected income, temporarily offsetting the company's profitability by off-balance-of-transaction tax, or by directly presenting a seriously conservative estimate of future income An executive can do this

 aam taur par kisi ke lekhankan or aay anumaan main 'atyadhik sankeern' hone par bahut kam kanoonee khatre hai
 When the entity is taken over by a private entity - at a dramatically reduced price - the new private owner has an unexpected benefit from the act of lowering the selling price of the top executive
 is prakaar dasiyon arab dollar pichley maalikon se adhigrahan karne vaale ko sthanantarit ho jate hai
 The former top official is then rewarded with a golden handshake to preside over the sale of the clams, which can sometimes be tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in exchange for one to two years of work
 jab ek saarvajanik rup se dhaarit sampatti, parsparik yaa labharahit sanghathan kaa nijeekaran hota he to sheersh adhikari aksar jabardast maudrik laabh lete hai
 Executives simplify this process by showing the entity in financial trouble - this reduces the selling price and makes it unprofitable, increasing the likelihood that the government will sell it
 vidambnaa yah he ki, is saarvajanik dharna se saarvajanik sampatti ko bech dene kii raajnneetik ichhashakti ko bal miltaa he ki nijee sansthaaen adhik kushalta se sanchalit hoti hai
 Again, due to anomalous information, policy makers and the general public see that a state-owned company that was a financial disaster - miraculously reversed in a few days by the private sector
 bahut adhik bhrashtachar vaale ek samaaj main, nijeekaran se vartmaan main sattarudh sarkaar or iske samarthakon ko swaamitv vaali parisampatti ke shuddh vartmaan mulya kaa ek bada bhaag beyimaani se janata se le kar unki pasandida takat ke dallalon ke khate main daalane kaa mauka mil jaataa he
 Without privatization, corrupt officials would have to reap their corrupt earnings gradually over time
 Therefore, an efficient privatization depends on the very low level of corruption among the current government officials, as it has the potential for far more efficient extraction of corrupt funds
 beshak, bhrasht sarkarein anya tareekon se bhi bhrasht kamai kaa badi kushalta ke saath nishkarshan kar sakati hai - vishesh rup se betahasha udhaar lekar apane bahut zyada pasandida samarthakon ke anubandhon main kharch karke 
 dashabdiyon purv bhrasht hastantaran ke dwaara liya gaya rin karadaataaon kii pidiyon ko chukaana padataa he
 Obviously, this can result in public property sales
 


 In the end, the public is left with a government that imposes heavy taxes on them and pays nothing in return
 The loan withdrawal is implemented by international agreements and agencies such as the IMF
 buniyadi dhaancha or rakrakhaav kaa balidaan ho jaataa he - samyaantar main desh kii aarthik kshamta or ksheen ho jaati he
 a review of the literature shows that the efficiency of privatization continuously improves, with industries well-versed with well-informed consumers
 aise dakshata laabh kaa matlab he jidipi main ekbargi vruddhi, kintu sudhare hue protsaahanon ke madhyam se nayaa karne or laagat kam karne ke saath aarthik vikaas kii dar badhane kii bhi pravriti hoti he
 The types of industries to which this is commonly applied include manufacturing and retailing
 Although social costs are usually associated with these efficiency gains, many economists argue that these can be dealt with through redistribution and possibly retraining by appropriate government support
 prakritik ekadhikaar or saarvajanik seva kshetron main, nijeekaran ke parinaam bahut adhik mishrit hai, kyonki udaar aarthik siddhant main nijee ekadhikaar bhi bahut kuch saarvajanik kii tarah hi vyavhaar karata he
 The government is in fact seen as a more natural provider of public goods and services
 haalanki, maujuuda saarvajanik kshetra ke prachaalan kii kshamta par prashn kiya ja saktaa he ki usamen parivartanon kii aavashyaktaa he
 Changes may include, among other things, related reforms such as greater transparency and accountability of management, a better cost-benefit analysis, better internal controls, regulatory systems and better financing rather than privatization itself
 raajnneetik bhrashtachar ke sambandh main, yah ek vivaadaaspad mudda he ki kya saarvajanik kshetra kaa aakaar swatah bhrashtachar main parinat hota he
 Nordic countries have large public areas but corruption is low
 haalanki, achche or praayah saral vinium, raajnneetik adhikaar or naagarik swatantraaa, ucch sarkari javabdehi ore paardarshita ke kaaran in deshon ke vyavsaay karne kii saralata kaa suchakank kaa score ucch rahata he
 Successful, corruption-free privatization and reorganization of government enterprises also appears in the Nordic countries
 udhaaharan ke liye, doorsanchaar ekadhikaar kii samaapti ke parinamswaroop kai nae udhyamiyon ne bazaar main pravesh kiya he or mulya or seva ke saath teevr pratispardhaa hui he
 Also about corruption, sales themselves provide a huge opportunity for grand corruption
 rus or latin america main nijeekaran ke saath rajya ke swaamitv vaali companiyon kii bikri ke dauraan bade paimaane par bhrashtachar bhi aayaa
 People with political connections improperly received large sums of money, which has maligned privatization in these areas
 jabaki media ne vyapak rup se bikri ke saath jude bhavy bhrashtachar ke bare main suchit kiya he, adhyayanon kaa kahana he ki badi hui parichaalan dakshata ke alaava dainik kshudra bhrashtachar bada mudda he, yaa nijeekaran ke bina bada ho saktaa he or gaiyr-nijeekaran kshetron main bhrashtachar adhik prachlit he
 Furthermore, evidence suggests that additional legal and informal activities are more prevalent in countries with less privatization
 udhyam ek saarvajanik upyogita ke rup main rah saktaa he
 a private non-profit organization can manage the enterprise
 niyantran nagar nigam sarkaar ko sthanantarit karnaa National services may subcontract their functions to private enterprises or contract them to external sources
 iskaa ek ullekhneey udhaaharan britain kaa he jahaan kai nagarpalikaon ne kachra sangrahan yaa parking jurmaana lagane ke kaam ke liye nijee companiyon ko anubandhit kar diya he
 In addition, the British government has made the private sector more involved in the work of the National Health Service, mainly by contracting out private companies to build and operate new hospitals
 vahaan vartmaan enechaes maanav sansaadhan par bhaar ko kam karne ke liye, isaki laagat ko cover karte hue marijon ko nijee shalya chikitsaalayon main bhejne kaa bhi prastaav he
 An enterprise can be privatized but the government retains a significant number of shares of the new company in lieu of it
 yah vishesh rup se france main ek ullekhneey ghatana he, jahaan sarkaar praayah nijee udyogon main ek "avarohak hissedari" apane paas rakhti he
 In Germany, the government has privatized Deutsche Telekom into smaller parts and still owns about a third of the company
 2005 se uttari rin-westephelia rajya bhi, jaisaa ki daawa kiya gaya he, badhati laagat ko niyantrit karne ke prayaas main, urja company i
on ke share kharidne kii yojana bana rahaa he
 While partial privatization may be an option, it is often a step toward more complete privatization
 yah vyapaar ko ek nirbaadh sankraman avadhi pradaan karata he, jiske dauraan vah dhire-dhire bazaar kii pratispardhaa ke saath samaayojan kar saktaa hai
 Some state-owned companies are so large that there is a risk of cash being sucked out of the rest of the market, even in the most liquid markets, which may be why sequential privatization is preferred
 bahu-charan nijeekaran ke pehle bhaag main bhi, pehle avasar par kam-mulya kii shikayaton ko kam karne ke liye udhyam ke liye ek moolyankan sthapit hoga
 In some examples of partial privatization of contracted services, parts of the state-owned service are provided by private-sector contractors, but the government has the ability to operate the contract itself at intervals if it wishes to do so
 An example of partial privatization would be some form of school bus service contract, any arrangement in which equipment and other resources purchased from government capital and resources already available with the government unit are used by the contractor to provide service over a period of time , But ownership remains with the government entity
 aanshik nijeekaran ke is rup main is chintaa ko dur kiya gaya he ki ek baar ek prachaalan anubandhit hone par, sarkaar paryaapt pratispardhi boli praapt karne main asamarth ho sakati he or rajya ke swaamitv ke tahat purv prachaalan kii tulana main kam vaanchhneeya sharten rakhni pad sakati hai
 Under that scenario, a reverse privatization would be possible for the government
 itihaas kaa sabase bada nijeekaran japan dak seva kaa hua he
 It was the country's largest employer and one-third of all Japanese government employees worked for the Japan Postal Service
 japan dak seva ko aksar duniya main nijee bachat kaa sabase bada dharak bataaya jaataa tha
 Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro was supposed to privatize it as it was considered inefficient and a source of corruption
 sitambar 2003 main, koizumi mantrimandal ne japan post kaa chaar alag companiyon main bantwaare kaa prastaav rakhaah ek bank, ek beemaa company, ek dak seva company or ek chauthi company shesh teenon ke khudara storefrants ke rup main dakgharon ko sanbhaalane ke liye
 Koizumi notified nationwide elections on 11 September 2005 after privatization was rejected by the Upper House
 unhone ghoshnaa kii ki ye chunaav dak nijeekaran par ek janamat sangrah honge
 Koizumi then won Junaw, received the required superb majority and reform referendum, and in October 2005, the bill to privatize the Japan Postal Service was passed in 2007

 Campaigns usually involve demonstrations and democratic political activities, sometimes officials use violence to suppress the opposition
 The opposition often has strong support from trade unions
 virodh aamtaur par pani ke nijeekaran ke khilaaf sarvaadhik majboot he- kochabmba ke saath haal ke udaahranon main haiti, ghana or urugve shaamil hai
 The water privatization ban was passed in October 2004 in a referendum initiated by a civil society in the latter case
 ek anubandhit swaamitv udhyam yaa sevaaon ke sarkari swaamitv main pratigaman or / yaa praavdhaan ko ulat nijeekaran yaa rashtriyakaran kaha jaataa he
 Such a situation often occurs when a privatization contractor fails financially and / or a governmental entity fails to purchase satisfactory services at prices below the prices at the time of government ownership or self-operation of services
 ek anya ghatana tab ho sakati he jab nijeekaran ke tahat vyavhaarya se adhik niyantran ko sarkari unit ke sarvottam hit main nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he
 National security concerns can be the source of reversal privatization actions when the most likely providers are non-domestic or international corporations or entities

 The name Markhor is a bit strange
 iskaa matlab farsi main "ek saanp khaane vaala pahari jaanavar" he
 By the way, it cannot eat snakes and snakes



 When it cannot eat snakes, why is it named Markhor xxrep 4 ? nahpaan pracheen bharat ke kshaharaatvansh kaa pratapi raja tha
 The determination of its reign is controversial
 iske sikkon par koi tithi ankit nahin he
 It is known from some records that it ruled in the forty-first and forty-sixth year of an unknown Samvat
 dubraille ke anusaar isamen vikrami sanwat nirdisht he
 Dineshchandra Sarkar considers the beginning of the era of the records of this Nahapan in 78 AD
 is prakaar nahpaan ke shasankaal kii gyaat tithiyaan 119 i
 or 125 i
 nirdhaarit kii ja sakati he
 Many silver and copper coins have been found for bathing
 jogalthambi se praapt ek jakhire ke 9270 sikkon ko, jo ki nahpaan ke hai, gautamiputra shatkarni ne pun: tankit kiya tha
 This suggests that Nahapan was a contemporary of Gautamiputra Shatakarni
 nahpaan shaq tha
 The origin of this dynasty appears to be northwest India
 sambhavat: isi kaaran nahpaan ke sikkon par kharoshtee aksharon kaa ankan hua he
 The ancestors of Nahapan ruled West India as the provincial rulers of the Kushanas, or Pahlavans, and held the title of ‘kshatrap’
 kshaharaatvansh kaa pratham gyaat raja, bhoomik, kshatrap maatr tha or raja kii oopaadhi nahin dhaaran karata tha
 The title of 'raja' is first found only on the coins of Nahapan which signifies the same independent power and kingship
 nahpaan kii purna oopaadhi 'rankhaakhratas khatpas' thi
 From about 119 AD to about 125 AD, Nahapan had greatly expanded his kingdom
 uski beti dakshamitra kaa vivaah dinaksut ushavadaat ke saath hua tha
 The Jamta Ushavdat of Nahapan was a great help in the expansion and governance of Nahapan
 nahpaan ne use malwon ke viruddh uttambhadron kii sahaayta ke liye bheja tha
 After defeating the Malavas, Ushavadat went to Pushkarkshetra and possibly even extended the royalty of drinking
 nahpaan ke amaatya aryaman ke ek abhilekh se nahpaan ke samrajya kaa acha parichay miltaa he
 From this and other records it is inferred that the rule of Nahapan was on the goverment food, Mamal diet, South and North Gujarat, Konkan, Bhadoncha to Sopara, Kayur diet, Prabhas, Dashpur and Pushkar regions
 abhilekhon ke prapthisthaan se aisa lagata he ki iske prabhavakshetra main tapti, banaas or chambal kii ghaatiyaan bhi thim
 But around 125 AD, the political impact of drinking began to decrease
 jogalthambi ke un sikkon se, jinhen gautamiputra shatkarni ne pun: tankit kiya tha, aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki 125 ke lagbhag, arthath, agyaat tithi 46 ke lagbhag, nahpaan gautamiputra shatkarni ke dwaara parajeet kar diya gaya hoga
 It is possible that the rule of drinking has also ended at this time, because after this there is no evidence of the existence of drinking
 is tathy kii pushti gautamiputra shatkarni kii mata balashri ke nasik abhilekh se bhi hoti he
 In the text of this inscription it is said that the ruins of the Khakharats were destroyed
 
 There is also a mention of those provinces which were once under bathing, but after this victory, Gautamiputra Shatkarni took over

 Although Tejas has often been called a product of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, the responsibility for the development of Tejas is actually that of Ada, a national consortium of more than 100 defense laboratories, industrial organizations and academic institutions and Hialei as its main contractor
 
 NDA aupchaarik rup se bhartiya raksha mantralay ke raksha anusandhan or vikaas sanghathan ke tatwadhan main aata he
 The Indian government's goal of "self-sufficiency" for LCA includes the three most sophisticated and most challenging systems - fly by wire flight control systems, multi-dimensional pulse-doppler radar and after-burning turbo fan engines

 In addition, engines and radars are the only major systems in which Ada seriously considered foreign equipment replacement, although these were interim measures taken for early LCA aircraft, with more time for full development of the native version
 Was necessary, as was the case with the LCA Cauvery power plant

 Two of the five key technologies identified by ADA at the beginning of the LCA program, which could enable India to design and build "fully indigenous" fighter aircraft - improved carbon-fiber composite structures and Development and manufacture of the skin and a modern "glass cockpit
" In fact, Ada's integrated automated software system has a profitable commercial fabric that can be used to structure and develop 3-D wrapper composite elements
 anya teen pramukh praudyogiki pahal ke raste main ai samasyaon kii chaaya main in kamyaabiyon kii taraf zyaadaatar logon kaa dhyaan nahin gaya he
 However, as a result of the successes of India's domestic industries, 70 percent of LCA parts are being manufactured in India and India's dependence on the use of imported equipment will gradually reduce in the coming years

 ASR ko isaki bhi aavashyaktaa thi ki mul sanrachana ek unnat prashikshak ke rup main or jahaaz aaparishan anukulan ke liye upyukt ho, haalanki is vikalp ko baad main chhod diya gaya
 This resulted in the creation of India's first home-grown jet fighter, the subsonic HF-24 Marut, which first flew in June 1961

 In 1969, the Government of India accepted the recommendation of its Aeronautics Committee that Hieli should design and develop advanced aircraft fighter aircraft with a proven engine
 On the basis of 'tactical air support aircraft', ASR was the same as Marut in marked form
 iske baad hieli ne 1975 main sanrachana kaa adhyayan puraa kiya, lekin videshi nirmaataaon se chune hue "kshamta siddh ingine" hasil karne main asamarthta ke kaaran yah pariyojna puri nahin ho saki
 As the production of the Ajit attack aircraft continues, the structural work for the engineers of Hieli was little left, while the requirement of the Indian Air Force for air superiority fighter aircraft with secondary air support and interception capability remained unfulfilled

 The development of an indigenous flight control system, radar and engine for LCA can be seen as an initiative of special importance
 naishanal aironautics leboratories, jo ab neshnal airospes leboratories ke naam se janaa jaataa he, ko udaan niyantran kanoonon ke vikaas kaa netritv karne ke liye chunaa gaya, jise aronotical development ysteblisment kaa samarthan hasil tha, jiske jimme ekikrut fli bai air kaa vikaas he
 Hieli and Electronics and Radar Development Establishment are jointly developing Tejas multi-dimensional radar systems
 gas terbine research ysteblisment ke paas tejas ke liye GTX 35VS kaveri after burning terbophan ingine kii sanrachana va samanaantar vikaas kaa daayitv he, jo kaveri ke uplabdh hone tak general electric F404 terbophan kaa ek antarim bijli sanyantr ke rup main upyog karegaa
 Indian Air Force air staff for LCA was not completed until October 1985
 is deree se mul kaarykram chhin-bhinn ho gaya or pehali udan april 1990 main hui or april 1995 main ise seva main liya gaya, haalanki, yah der ek vardaan sabit ho sakati he, kyonki isse kida ko rashtriya anusandhan evam vikaas or audyogic sansaadhan, bhartee karmiyon ko, buniyadi dhaancha taiyaar karne jaise kaamon ko kramvaar karne or ek spasht drushtikon hasil karne ke liye samay mila, jisase ki unnat praudyogikiyon desh main hi viksit kiya ja sake or aayaat kii aavashyaktaa na pade
 The project definition began in October 1987 and was completed in September 1988
 PD kii samiksha karne or apni vyapak vimaanan visheshgyata ke aadhaar par salaah dene ke liye france ke daslt aviation ko salaahkaar ke rup main niyukt kiya gaya
 The PD stage is an early critical element in the aircraft structure and development process, as it results in key elements of a detailed structure, manufacturing approach, and maintenance requirements
 Furthermore, it is at this point that the overall program cost is most effectively controlled
 sanrachana aavashyaktaaon, kshamtaaon or suvidhaon main badlaavon ko lagu karne kii laagat teji se badhati jaati he or shuru kiye jane ke samay kii tulana main vikaas kaa graph neeche girane lagata he or jisase kaarykram ko puraa karne main adhik samay or laagat kii sambhaavna rahati he
 The LCA structure was finalized in 1990 and was intended as a small delta winged machine with "relax Static Stability" to enhance combat skills
 Almost immediately, there was some concern for some specified reasons, such as aviation electronic equipment and advanced composite infrastructure, and the Indian Air Force doubted whether India had sufficient infrastructure to support such an ambitious project
 a government review committee was formed in May 1989, which gave a general opinion that India has more sufficiency in most areas of infrastructure, facilities and technology to undertake the project
 haalanki, doordarshita ke ek kadam ke rup main yah nirnay liya gaya ki kaarykram ke purna paimaane par ejineering ke vikaas ke str ko do charnon main aage badhanaa hoga
 Phase-one will focus on "proof of Concept" and will include the structure, development and testing of two technology demonstrator aircraft and the formation of a structural sample test airframe and complete the Government of India LCA structure only after successful testing of TD aircraft
 Will support After this, the construction of two prototype vehicles and the necessary infrastructure and test facilities for the aircraft will begin
 The second phase will include the construction of three more prototype vehicles, a hard test sample and restoration of development and testing facilities at various centers
 charan-1 1990 main shuru kiya or hieli ne 1991 ke madhya main praudyogiki pradarshnon par kaam shuru kar diya, haalanki, vittiya sankat ke kaaran april 1993 tak purna paimaane par dhan adhikrut nahin kiya gaya, jiske parinamswaroop FSED ke charan-1 kaa kaam 1 june se shuru hua
 The first technology demonstrator, the TD-1, was completed on 17 November 1995 and then the TD-2 on 17 November 1998, but was kept on the ground for several years due to several structural concerns and trouble developing flight control systems
 
 elsie ke liye sabase mahatvakankshi aavashyaktaaon main se ek vinirdesan tha "relax static stability" 
 haalanki damelt ne 1988 main ek analog FCS pranali kaa prastaav diya tha, par kida ne mana ki digital udaan niyantran praudyogiki jaldi hi isaki jagah le legi
 general dinemics YF-16 par shuru hui, jo sanrachana ke taur par airodynemic najariye se thodaa asthir kaha jane vaala duniya kaa pehla vimaan tha
 The structure of most aircraft was "positive" for static stability, which means they have a natural tendency to return to a level and control flight in the absence of control information
 lekin yah gun payalat kii kushal prayaason ke vipareet hota hai
 On the other hand, an aircraft with "negative" static stability can divert from its level and controlled flight, unless the pilot constantly attempts to balance it, although it increases maneuverability, but it is very much up to the pilot to How much does a mechanical flight control system rely on
 FBW udaan niyantran pranali kaa vikaas udaan niyantran kanoonon or udaan niyantran computaron ke liye software code par hue mahange lekhan kaa vyapak gyaan maangata he, saath hi saath udan electranik pranali or anya electronic pranaaliyon ke saath apane ekikaran kii aavashyaktaa kii jaankaree honi bhi jaruri he
 When the LCA program was introduced, FBW was a state-of-the-art technology and was so sensitive that India could not find a country that would be ready to export it
 Therefore, the LCA National Control Law Team was formed in 1992 by the National Aeronautics Laboratory to develop its own version of India
 CLAW kii team ke vaigyanikon or ganitagyon ne apane niyantran kanoonon ko viksit karne main kamyaabi pai, lekin ve unka pareekshan nahin kar sake, kyonki bharat ke paas us samay samunnat "real time ground stimulators" nahin the
 Accordingly, in 1993 British Aerospace and Lockheed Martin were called for help, but the aeronautical development establishment's attempt to code control laws into FCS software proved to be a bigger task than previously expected
 vishisht niyantran kanoon kii samasyaon kaa BAE simulator main jaanch kii gayi
 While it was in the process of being developed, progressive elements of its coding were tested in the "minibird" and "ironbird" test rings at ADE and Hieli, respectively
 ekikrut udaan niyantran software kii F-16 VISTA par udaan ke dauraan duusari shrinkhalaa kaa simulation pareekshan kiya gaya
 Simulator, 33 test flights were completed in July 1996
 However, Lockheed Martin's involvement ended in 1998, as it was banned by the US in May that year in response to India's other nuclear tests
 NAL kii CLAW team ne ek samay swadesh main hi udaan niyantran kanoonon ke ekikaran ko safaltaapurvak puraa karne main kamyaabi pai or FCS saftware ne TD-1 par 50 ghante ke payalat pareekshan ko bina kisi rukaawat ke puraa kiya, iske parinamswaroop 2001 ke shuru main is vimaan ko udaan kii manjuuri de di gai
 In January 2001, the first flight of LCA took place from TD to the National Flight Test Center near Bangalore
 This was followed by its first successful supersonic flight on 1 August 2003
 In September 2001, the TD-2 got time to make its first flight, until 6 June 2002 it could not get this chance
 Tejas] kida kii team ne ek or mahatvapurn praudyogiki kshetra ko swadesh main viksit karne ke liye chunaa, jo tejas kaa bahu aiami radar he
 Initially it was planned for the LCA using the Ericsson microwave system PS-05 / AI / J-band multi-function radar developed for the Saab JAS-39 Gripen by Ericsson and Ferranti Defense System Integration
 haalanki, 1990 ke dashak main anya radaaron kii jaanch ke baad,drdo ko vishwaas ho gaya ki iskaa swadeshi vikaas sambhav he
 haili's Hyderabad division and LRDE were jointly selected to lead the MMR program
 haalanki yah bilkul spasht nahin he ki kab sanrachana kaa kaam shuru kiya jaayegaa, par radar vikaas kaa prayaas 1997 main shuru hua
 drdo's Center for Airborne Studies is responsible for running the testing program for MMR
 1996 or 1997 ke bich, CABS ne maujuuda hieli / HS-748M hawaii nigaraanee post testbed ko elsie ke electranik udaan pranali or radar ke test bed main parivartit kar diya, jise 'hack' kaha gaya or rotodom essembly ke alaava ekmaatr bade sanrachanaatmak parivartan ke rup main janaa gaya, iske saath elsie kii naak shanku ko MMR ke mutabik abhiyojit kiya gaya
 By 2002 MMR was reported to be experiencing development delays and cost overruns

 In May 2006, it was revealed that the performance of many tested methods is still "below expectations"
 parinamswaroop, kida ne ek hathiyaar chhodane vaale pod ke saath udaan ke dauraan hathiyaar pareekshanon ko kam kar diya, jo ek praathmik sensor nahin he, jisase kai mahatvapurn pareekshanon ko sthagit rakhaa gaya
 According to the test report, the root cause of the problem is the compatibility issue between Radar and the advanced signal processor module made by LRDE
 elta ke EL / M-2052 jaise 'aaf da self' videshi radar ko hasil karne ke antarim vikalp par gambhirtha se vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Initially, it was decided to equip the prototype aircraft with General Electric F404-GE-F2J3 afterburning turbofan engines
 ek hi saath, 1986 main, ek swadeshi bijli sanyantr ke vikaas ke liye samanaantar kaarykram shuru kiya gaya
 Under the leadership of the Gas Turbine Research Authority, the GTRE GTX-35VS, named "kaveri", was expected to replace the fully produced aircraft F404
 haalanki, takneekee kathinaaiyon ke kaaran kaveri vikaas kaarykram kii pragati dhimi ho gai
 In mid-2004, the Kaveri failed altitude tests in Russia and the final hopes of projecting it as the first production of the Tejas aircraft expired
 kaveri ke aage vikaas ke liye ek nivida jari kar companiyon ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 In February 2006, Ada contracted with French aircraft engine company Sneesma for technical assistance in solving problems in Kaveri
 us samay, DRDO ko tejas main upyog ke liye 2009-10 tak kaveri kaa ingine taiyaar hone kii aashaa hui
 In 2003, it was decided to purchase high quality General Electric F404, F404-GE-IN20 engines for eight pre-produced LSP aircraft and two naval prototypes, in view of the flaws in Kaveri's development
 kida ne farvari 2004 main ek america general electric ko 17-IN20 injanon kii abhiyantriki viksit karne va unke utpaadan ke liye 105 million america dollar kaa theka diya, jisaki aapurti 2006 main shuru hui
 In February 2007, Hieli ordered an additional F404-GE-IN20 afterburning turbofan engine to power the first operational squadron of Tejas fighter aircraft for the Indian Air Force
 samay par aadesh se pehle, F404-GE-IN20 ko pareekshan ke rup main halke ladaaku vimaan main lagaaya gaya or yah 2007 ke madhya tak pareekshan udaan ke antim moolyankan kaa ek hissaa tha
 The F404-GE-IN20 engine gained thrust without installing 19,000 pounds before being installed, completing a 330-hour accelerated mission test, equivalent to a 1000-hour flight
 IN20 ne F2J3 vikaas injanon kii jagah lee, jinase 600 udaanen bhari gayi or isamen aath injanon kaa upyog kiya gaya
 In September 2008, it was announced that Cauvery would not be ready in time for Tejas and would have to choose a power plant that was in the production process
 Ada plans to issue a request proposal for a more powerful engine with a 95 to 100 kiloneuton range
 iske sambhavit daavedaar eurojet EJ200 or general electric F414 ho sakate hai
 The propulsion offering of the Eurojet EJ200 has been strongly considered
 ekal crystal terbine blade praudyogiki, jise mul rup se bhartiya vaigyanikon ko dene se inkaar kar diya gaya tha, bhi eurojet ne EJ200 ingine ke madhyam se bharat ko dene kii peshkash kii
 In May 2009, it was announced that a global tender of Rs 3,300 crore would be floated to acquire more powerful engines for the aircraft, as the current General Electric F404 engines do not generate enough strength that the aircraft with the least weapon load Be able to attack
 eurojet terbo or america company general electric elsie ke liye 100 injanon kii aapurti ke liye pratispardhaa karengi
 The Eurojet EJ200 and GE F-414 engines will meet the requirements of the Indian Air Force as they generate 95–100 kilonuton strength
 bhartiya vaayu sena ke sutron kii ore se yah bhi kaha gaya ki airfrem kii sanrachana is tarah se kii jaayegi ki isamen baari ingine lagaaye ja saken, jisamen teen-chaar saal tak kaa samay lagane kii ummid he
 However, the initial batches of Tejas aircraft will be powered by low-power General Electric F404 engines, which generate 80–85 kilonutons of strength
 disambar 1996 main, tatkaaleen vaigyanik salaahkaar apije abdul kalam ne gananaa kar isaki ikai laagat 21 lakh america dollar bataai
 In late 2001, Dr
 Kota Harinarayan, director of ADA and LCA programs, estimated the unit cost of LCA at US $ 17–2 million and stated that once production started it could cost up to US $ 150 million
 haalanki, 2001 tak dusron kaa sanket tha ki elsie kii laagat 24 million america dollars aayegaa
 At current rates it still costs US $ 21

 Once the initial operating clearance is granted, it will be included in a limited number of Indian Air Force
 After the final operating approval is obtained, it will be included on a full scale
 IOC testing is expected to be completed by 2009 and FOC testing by 2010

 This reveals the desire of the Indian Air Force that it is in a hurry to become more involved in the development of LCA as well as to include new aircraft
 yah team bangalore main tainaat he
 Senior officials of Hieli had said in March 2005 that the Indian Air Force would issue orders of Rs 2,000 crore for 20 Tejas and after that another 20 aircraft would be procured

 Navy Chief Admiral Nirmal Verma said in his first weekly news conference of the Navy that by December 2009 DRDO has assured that the Navy version of the LCA will be ready for carrier testing by 2013 and will deploy to Gorshkov / Vikramaditya as well as Indian aircraft ships
 Will be possible
 unhone kaha ki nausena IAC-2 ke liye or adhik sakasham vaahak vimaan ke liye ek avadharanatmak adhyayan 'kar rahaa tha
 Some of the features of the "LCA version of the naval": tejas ekal ingine va vividh bhoomikaaon vaala jet ladaaku vimaan he, jisaki visheshtaayen hai poonchhrahit hona or yogic delta wing platform vaala or yah "relaxd statics stability"sanrachana vaala he, jisase vimaan kaa yudhkaushal badhaane main madad milti he
 It was originally intended to serve as a ground-attack attack aircraft as a mid-level "silent bomb" to prove air superiority, but due to the flexibility in structural considerations it would allow air to surface and navigation
 - Anti-weapon form can be integrated, allowing it to gain multiple roles and the ability to complete a variety of missions
 poonchhrahit or yogic delta planfarm kii sanrachana tejas ko chota or halkaa rakhane ke liye hai
 The use of this planform keeps control surface requirements to a minimum, allowing a wider range of external store to be carried and characterized by better close combat, higher speeds, and higher alpha roles than the cruciform structure
 vyapak paimaane par scale model par wing tunnel pareekshan model or jatil computesnal taral gatiki vishleshan se elsie kaa arodynemic vinyas kam se kam hua he, jisase ise nunatam supersonic draig, lo wing loding or role or pich kii ucch dar hasil ho sakaa he
 All weapons are carried in each branch with seven hardpoints with a total capacity of one or more 4,000 kg: three stations under each wing and one at the fuselage centerline

 Tejas have an integral internal fuel tank, which can hold 3,000 kg of fuel in the fuselage and wing and further a fixed infight refueling device towards the fuselage starboard
 bahari taur par inboard or midboard wing steshnon tathaa centerline fuzleg stesan main teen 1,200 yaa yaa paanch 800-litre eendhan tanks tak ke "wet" hardpoint praavdhaan hote hai
 LCA is made of aluminum-lithium alloys, carbon fiber composites and titanium alloy-steels
 tejas vajan ke rup main apane airfrem ke 45% hisse tak ke liye C-FC samagriyaan, jisamen ek fuzleg pankh, ilevan telphin, radar, air brake or landing gear daravaaje bhi shaamil hote hai
 The use of blending metals makes the aircraft both lighter and stronger than the all-metal structure, and the LCA c-fcs' planning percentage is one of the highest among contemporary aircraft of its category
 vimaan ko bahut halkaa banane ke alaava, vahaan unamem kam se kam jod yaa keelein hoti hai, jo vimaanon kii vishwasaneeyata ko badhaati he or sanrachanaatmak kamajori se honevaali daraar kii ashanka ko kam karti he

 The airframe of the Tejas' naval version will be modified with respect to nose tilt to further improve visualization when landing the aircraft, and to increase speed during flight and use wing leading edge vortex controllers
 levcons operate on control surfaces that extend from the wing root leading edge and thus the LCA can be operated optimally during slow speeds, otherwise the theda is obstructed due to increased stretch, as in delta wing structures it happens
 ek atirikt laabh yah hota he ki LEVCON bhi hamale ke ucch kone par niyantrit karne kii kshamta badhaata he
 The backside of the Naval Tejas is also strong, with a tall and strong wheel and nose wheel steering for maneuverability on the deck
