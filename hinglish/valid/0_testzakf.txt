 maharaja agrasen ek puranic samaajwaad ke prarvatak, yug purush, ram rajya ke samarthak evam mahaadaani evam samaajwaad ke pratham praneta the
 He was the Maharaja of the Republic called Agrodaya
 jisaki rajdhani agroha thi According to religious belief, he was born 5185 years ago at the end of Suryavanshi Maharaja Vallabh Sen and early Kali Yuga
 jo kii samast khandav prastha, ballab garh, agr janapad ke raja the un ke raaj main koi dukhi yaa laachaar nahin tha
 He was very popular among his subjects since childhood
 ve ek dharmik, shanti doot, praja vatsal, hinsa virdohi, bali pratha ko band karwaane vaale, karunanidhi, sab jeevon se prem, sneh rakhane vaale dayaaloo raja the
 He was the elder brother of Ballur Garh and eldest son of King Ballabh of Agra, Shursen
 samyaanusaar yuvavastha main unhen raja nagaraj kii kanya rajkumaari madhavi ke swayamvar main shaamil hone kaa nyotaa mila
 Many kings and princes came from far and wide in that swayamvara
 yahaan tak ki devataaon ke raja indra bhi rajkumaari ke saundarya ke vasheebhoot ho vahaan padhaare the
 In Swayamvar, Princess Madhavi put Jayamala on Prince Agrasen's neck
 yah do alag-alag sampradaayon, jatiyon or samskritiyon kaa mail tha
 While Agrasen was Suryavanshi, Madhavi was the daughter of Nagavansh
 is vivaah se indra jalan or gusse se aape se baahar ho gayi or unhone pratapnagar main varsha kaa hona roak diya
 There was a tragedy all around
 log akaal mrityu kaa grass banane lage
 Then Maharaj Agrasen waged war against Indra
 chunki agrasen dharm-yuddh lad rahe the to unka palada baari tha jise dekh devataaon ne naarad rishi ko madhyasth bana donon ke bich sulah karvaa di
 After some time, Maharaja Agrasen did austerity of Shivaji going to Kashi city for the well being of his subjects, so that Lord Shiva was pleased and advised him to do penance for Mother Lakshmi
 maan lakshmi ne paroapkaar hetu kii gayi tapasya se khush ho unhen darshan die or kaha ki apana ek nayaa rajya banaaen or kshaatr dharm kaa paalan karte huve apane rajya tathaa praja kaa paalan - poshann va raksha karen ! unka rajya hamesa dhan-dhaany se paripurna rahegaa| Maharaj Agrasen traveled all over India with his queen Madhavi to establish his new kingdom
 isi dauraan unhen ek jagah ek sherni ek shaavak ko janm dete dikhi, kehete he janm lete hi shaavak ne maharaja agrasen ke hathi ko apni maan ke liye sankat samajhakar tatkaal hathi par chalaang laga di
 He felt that it was a divine message that was signaling to him to establish a kingdom on this heroic land
 rishi muniyon or jyotishiyon kii salaah par naye rajya kaa naam agreygan yaa agroday rakhaa gaya or jis jagah shaavak kaa janm hua tha us jagah agroday kii rajdhani agroha kii sthapana kii gai
 This place is near Hisar in present day Haryana
 aaj bhi yah sthaan agarwal samaaj ke liye paanchave dham ke rup main puja jaataa he, vartmaan main agroha vikaas trust ne bahut sundar mandir, dharmashalaayein aadi banaakar yahaan aane vaale agarwal samaaj ke logo ke liye suvidhaayen juta di he
 Maharaja Agrasen is called the harbinger of socialism
 apane kshetra main sachche samaajwaad kii sthapana hetu unhone niyam banaaya ki unke nagar main baahar se aakar basane vaale prayek parivaar kii sahaayta ke liye nagar kaa prayek parivaar use ek tatkaaleen prachlan kaa sikaa va ek eent degaa, jisase aasaani se navagantuk parivaar swayan ke liye nivas sthaan va vyapaar kaa prabandh kar sake
 Maharaja Agrasen gave birth to a new system in retaliation of the system of systemic governance, he re-established the basic beliefs of the Vedic Sanatan Arya Sanskriti in the reorganization of the state with the development of agri-business, industry, cow slaughter as well as the re-establishment of moral values
 Pioneered is tarah maharaj agrasen ke raajkaal main agroday ganraajya ne din dooni- raat chauguni tarakkee kii
 It is said that at the time of its extreme prosperity, there used to be millions of traders
 vahaan aane vaale navaagat parivaar ko rajya main basane vaale parivaar sahaayta ke taur par ek rupaya or ek eent bhent karte the, is tarah us navaagat ko lakhon rupee or inten apane ko sthapit karne hetu praapt ho jaati thim jisase vah chintaa rahit ho apana vyapaar shuru kar letaa tha
 With the grace of Mata Mahalakshmi, Maharaja Agrasen divided his kingdom into 18 republics to form a huge kingdom, which was called Agraya Republic or Agrodaya in his name
 
 Maharishi Garg pledged to perform 18 yajna to Maharaja Agrasen with 18 Ganadhipatis
 yagyon main baithe in 18 ganadhipatiyon ke naam par hi agravansh ke saadhe satraa gotro kii sthapana hui
 At that time, animal sacrifice was compulsorily offered in yagyas
 pratham yajna ke purohit swayan garg rishi bane, sabase bade rajkumaar vibhu ko dikshit kar unhen garg gotra se mantrit kiya
 Similarly, the second yajna was conducted by Gobhil Rishi and the second Ghanadhipati was given the Goyal gotra
 teesraa yajna gautam rishi ne goin gotra dhaaran karavaaya, chauthe main vatsa rishi ne bansal gotra, paanchave main kowshik rishi ne kansal gotra, chathe shandilya rishi ne singhl gotra, saatve main mangal rishi ne mangal gotra, aathven main jaimin ne jindal gotra, nawein main tandya rishi ne tingal gotra, dasven main aurv rishi ne airan gotra, gyaraven main dhaumy rishi ne dhaaran gotra, barahawein main mudgal rishi ne mandal gotra, terahaven main vasishtha rishi ne bindal gotra, chaudaaven main maitrey rishi ne mittal gotra, pandrahawein kashyap rishi ne kuchchhal gotra diya
 17 Yagyas were completed
 jis samay 18 wein yajna main jivit pashuon kii bali di ja rahi thi, maharaj agrasen ko us drishy ko dekhakar ghrinaa utpann ho gai
 He stopped the yagya in the middle and said that in future no person of my kingdom will offer animal sacrifice in the yajna, nor will he kill the animal, nor eat the meat and every person of the kingdom will protect the living beings
 is ghatana se prabhavit hokar unhone ahimsa dharm ko apana liya
 Here in the last and eighty-nine yajna, the sacrifice of animal sacrifice by Yajnacharyo was said to be mandatory, if not, the gotra would remain incomplete, it was said, but in the eighteenth yagna on the orders of Maharaja Agrasen, Nagendra Rishi was invited from Nangal gotra
 yah gotra pashubali naa hone ke kaaran aadha mana jaataa he, is prakaar agarwal samaaj me aaj bhi 18 nahi, saadhe satraa gotra prachlit he

 jai shri! Maharaj divided his kingdom into 18 ganas and established 18 gotras in the name of 18 gurus
 har gotra alag hone ke baavjood ve sab ek hi parivaar ke ang bane rahe
 For this reason, Agroha was also able to make all round progress
 rajya ke unheen 18ganon se ek-ek pratinidhi lekar unhone loktantric rajya kii sthapana kii, jiskaa swaroop aaj hamen vartmaan loktantr pranali main bhi dikhaayi padataa he
 Following are the 18 tribes of Agrawalas - us samay yajna karnaa samruddhi, vaibhav or khushhaali kii nishaani mana jaataa tha
 Maharaj Agrasen performed many yagyas
 ek baar yajna main bali ke liye laae gayi ghode ko bahut baichaiyn or daraa hua paa unhen vichaar aayaa ki aisi samruddhi kaa kya phayda jo mook pashuon ke khun se sarabor ho
 At the same time, he put a stop to Pashu Bali, even in the absence of his ministers
 isiilie aaj bhi agravansh samaaj hinsa se dur hi rahata he
 His neighboring king was very envious of Maharaj Agrasen's splendor of the kingdom
 isliye ve baar-baar agroha par akraman karte rahete the
 Despite repeated mouthfuls, there was tension in the state due to them
 in yudhon ke kaaran agrasenji ke praja kii bhalaai ke kaamon main vighn padataa rahata tha
 People were also frightened and plagued by daily battles
 isi ke saath-saath ek baar agroha main bady bheeshan aag lagi
 He could not be controlled in any way
 us agnikand se hajaaron log begharbar ho gayi or jeevika kii talash main bharat ke vibhinn pradeshon main ja based
 But he did not leave his identity
 ve sab aaj bhi agarwal hi kahalwanaa pasand karte hai or usee 18 gotron se apni pahchaan banaae hue hai
 Even today they all follow the path directed by Maharaj Agrasen
 maharaja agrasen kii rajdhani agroha thi
 Discipline was followed in his rule
 janata nisthapurvak swatantraaa ke saath apane karttavya kaa nirvaah karti thi
 Maharaj Agrasen ruled for 108 years
 unhone jin jivan mulyon ko grahan kiya unamem parampara evam prayog kaa santulit saamanjasy dikhaai detaa he
 On the one hand, he accepted the Karmakshetra directed for the Kshatriya varna in Hindu scriptures and on the other hand set new ideals in the perspective of the country
 unke jivan ke mul rup se teen adarsh hai- loktantric shashan vyavastha, aarthik samarupata evam saamaajik samanta
 After attaining a certain age, on consultation with Kuladevi Mahalakshmi, he went into austerities by handing over the rule of the Agrarian Republic to his eldest son Vibhu
 apni jindagi ke antim samay main maharaj ne apane jyeshth putr vibhu ko sari jimmedaari saunp kar vanprastha ashram apana liya
 Even today in history Maharaj Agrasen is mentioned as the supremely virtuous, religious, tolerant, inspiring great man of socialism
 desh main jagah-jagah aspataal, skool, baavdi, dharmashalas aadi agrasen ke jivan mulyon kaa aadhaar hai or ye jivan mulya maanav aasthaa ke pratik hai
 The origin of the Agrawalas mentioned in ancient texts is today the origin of Agrawal
 dilli se 190 tathaa hisar se 20 kilometre dur haryana main maharaja agrasen raashtra maarg sankhya - 10 hisar - sirsa bas maarg ke kinare ek khede ke rup main sthit he
 Once the capital of Maharaja Agrasen, this city is today located as a simple village with a population of five hundred families
 iske sameep hi pracheen rajdhani agreh ke avshesh theh ke rup main 650 ekad bhoomi main faile hai
 Which shows the glorious history of Agroha Nagar of Agrasen Maharaj
 vaise maharaja agrasen par anginat pustake likhi ja chuki hai
 The well-known writer Bharatendu Harishchandra, who was also from the Agrawal community himself, wrote an authentic treatise called "the Origin of Agrawalas" in 1871, which describes them in detail
 24 sitambar 1976 main bharat sarkaar dwaara 25 paise kaa dak tikat maharaja agrasen ke naam par jari kiya gaya
 In 1995, the Indian government purchased a special oil carrier from South Korea for 350 crores, named "maharaja Agrasen"
 jisaki kshamta 1,80, xxrep 4 0 ton he
 The official name of National Highway-10 is on Maharaja Agrasen
 agrasen kii baawali, jo dilli ke conot place ke paas heley road main sthit he
 It is a 60 meter long and 15 meter wide stepwell, which is under the supervision of the Archaeological Survey of India under the Archaeological Sites and Remains Act 1958
 san 2012 main bhartiya dak agrasen kii baawali par dak tikat jari kiya gaya
 Being an inseparable part of the Indian Union, it is not appropriate to separate Kerala's economic system from the national economic system
 phir bhi kerala kii aarthik vyavastha kii apni visheshtaayen hai
 The achievements of Kerala are commendable as per the basic information of human resource development
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas ke buniyadi tattvon main ullekhneey hai - bharat ke anya rajyon kii tulana main aabaadi kii kam vruddhi dar, rashtriya ausat saghanta se unchi dar, unchi aayu-dar, gambhir swasthya chetana, kam shishu mrityu dar, unchi sakshartaa, praathmik shiksha kii saarvajaniktaa, ucch shiksha kii suvidha aadi aarthik pragati ke anukool hai
 But due to slowdown in production sector, high unemployment rate, rising market prices, low per capita income, impact of consumer litigation etc
, the economy of Kerala is getting complicated
 lambi aayu dar ke maamle main kerala kii tulana dakshin korea, malaysia, china aadi se kii ja sakati he
 But all three are different from Kerala and are on the path of economic development
 yadhyapi maanav sansaadhan vikaas ke suchakon ke anusaar kerala bhartiya rajyon main agrani he
 In the past, Kerala's per capita income rate was below the national income rate
 jabaki kerala kii aarthik vyavastha vikaas kaa gun prakat karti he
 In the late eighties, Kerala's economic growth has surpassed the average national economic growth rate
 yah vikaas abhi bhi jari he
 But this alone does not make the state strong
 vaishvikaran ke pratikul prabhaav ne krishi tathaa anya paramparaagat kshetron kaa khaatmaa kar diya he
 Development has not been done in these areas for the last six-seven years
 lekin ab is sthiti main badlaav aana shuru hua he jo shubhasuchak he
 Kerala has to achieve economic development which is just, permanent and immediate
 saath hi vikaas ke kshetra main jo niti apanaai gayi he usamen sarkari hastkshep kam karne yaa saamaajik kalyaan ke vyay kam karne kaa koi prayaas nahin dikhaai detaa
 Development of pre-independence Thiruvittankur, Kochi, Malabar regions is the backdrop of modern Kerala's economic system
 bhugolic evam prakritik visheshtaayen kerala kii aarthik vyavastha ko prakritik sampada ke vaividhya ke saath shram sambandhi vaividhya bhi pradaan karti hai
 Kerala is divided into three major geographical regions
 tateey kshetra sarvaadhik saghan aabaadi vaala kshetra he
 Its fertile soil, riverine area, lakes etc
 are suitable for fish production, rice, coconut and greens
 parvatiy evam samudr tateey kshetron ke bich ke pradeshon main nariyal, chaaval, tapyoka, supaari ke ped, kaashew ke ped, rabad, kalimirch, adarak aadi kii kheti hoti he
 The cultivation of coffee, tea, rubber in the Eastern Pahari region has been going on since colonial times
 20 veen sadi ke madhya main purvi pahari kshetra main jansanchaar evam sthaapan hua isse kerala kii aarthik vyavastha viksit hui
 Agriculture in Kerala is suitable for food grains and export crops
 shashan vyavastha tathaa vyapaar ke kaaran niryaat kii janevaali fasalon badhotari hui he
 Coir industry, wood industry, edible oil production etc
 are also based on agriculture
 isi ke saath hi dhaatuen, rasayan vastuen, ejineering aadi ko aadhaar banane vaale bade-bade udyog bhi vikaas karne lage hai
 Public and private establishments are working in these areas
 kayar utpaadan, kaarigari, handloom aadi kerala ke paramparaagat vyavsaay he
 Nevertheless, it is not fair to say that the economic system of Kerala is based solely on agriculture
 kerala ke aarthik vikaas kaa ullekhneey pahalu na to praathmik kshetra maane janevaala krishi udyog he or na hi vibhinn utpaadan-nirmaan se yukt udyog kshetra he
 The main aspect of economic development is the third sector called the service sector
 keraly aamadani tathaa rojgaar kaa adhikansh bhaag yaheen se praapt hota he
 Kerala is moving ahead of the other states of India in almost all the regions, generally any state can reach the high foot of economic development only by crossing the first, second and third regions
 is aarthik siddhant ke viruddh pratham kshetra evam dwitiya kshetra ko chod tritiy kshetra main pahunchakar kerala mrityu dar, sakshartaa aurat aayu aadi main viksit deshon ke samaksh sthaan grahan kar saktaa he
 How Kerala could achieve this status by making low capital per capita income and high unemployment remains an unanswered question
 bharat kaa koi bhi doosraa rajya is prakaar duniya kaa dhyaan aakrisht nahin kar sakaa
 Not only in the economic sector, but also in the political, social and cultural fields, the development that has taken place in Kerala is being discussed in developed countries
 1980 ke ant main kerala kii aarthik vyavastha ne jo unnati kii uski Kerala Model naam se videshon main bhi charchaa hui
 Many questions are raised today regarding this example
 uske sthayitv par kai arthshaastri andeh prakat karte hai
 Since the 19th century, the government has adopted a social welfare policy and under its implementation the government has been spending for basic amenities is the main source of social development of Kerala
 iske atirikt bharat ke anyaanya kshetron tathaa videshon, visheshkar khadi kshetron ke apravasi keraly se praapt dhan raashi bhi is vikaas kaa kaaran he
 The immigrant Keralais have a great contribution in the economic system of modern Kerala
 aarthik vyavastha ke vikaas keliye 2007 - 2008 kaa bajet kuch kaary paddatiyaan prastut karata he unamem mukhya bindu nimnlikhit hai - 1
 Protection of agriculture and traditional areas
 2
 shiksha, swasthya aadi saarvajanik sevaaon kaa gun badhaana
 3
 Strive to dominate the tightly contested areas like I, T
 Tourism, Light Engineering etc
 4
 uparyukt jo vikaas kshetron ke liye aavashyak suvidhaayen pradaan karnaa
 5
 To solve the backward condition of the tribals, Dalits, fishermen etc
 striyon ke prati nyaay karne kaa purvaadhik dridhta se karyanvayan
 Protection of environment
 6
 janatantric adhikaar vikendrikaran tathaa anya prashasan sambandhi - sudhaar
 Eradication of corruption
 kerala kii aarthik vyavastha ke sudruth aadhaar hai - vaanijya bank, sahakaari bank, mudra vinimay vyavastha, yatayaat kaa vikaas, shiksha - swasthya aadi kshetron main hui pragati, shaktishaalee shramik aandolan, sahakaari aandolan aadi
 As mentioned earlier, the economic system of Kerala is developing from agricultural culture to service culture
 bharat kii krishi pradhan aarthik vyavastha main kerala kaa pramukh sthaan he
 The elements that determine the agricultural life of Kerala are: - The specific natural area, the variety of soils and the climate
 kerala kii pramukh fasalein hai - chaaval, nariyal, daal kii vibhinn kismein, rabad, supaari, ilaychi, coffee, chaay, kaashew, tapyoka, kalimirch, adarak, haldi, cocao, laung, jaifal aadi
 North Indian crops like potato, onion etc
 are also grown here
 rabad, coffee, ilaychi, chaay aadi farm fasalein maani jaati hai
 The second type of crops are mainly with the farming families who are adopting agriculture as a livelihood
 kerala kaa krishi kshetra anek sankaton kaa saamana kar rahaa he jinamein chaaval tathaa nariyal donon ke utpaadan kshetra main ghor sankat hai
 Today, Kerala has to depend on other states for rice and vegetables
 yahi nahin krishi bhoomi kaa vistaar bhi ghat gaya he
 The period of soil-filling in agricultural land is going on, which is pushing Kerala towards serious crisis
 yadhyapi kheton main mitti daalkar unhen nariyal ke bageeche banaaya gaya he phir bhi nariyal ke utpaadan main vruddhi nahin hui he
 The production of coconut in 1992 - 1993 was 5843 per hectare which in 2000 increased to 5638 hectares
 rin bhaar, fasalon kaa vinaash, daam giravat ke kaaran krishakon kaa jivan kathin ban gaya he
 Therefore, the government is trying to revive agriculture by setting up agricultural packages and credit assurance commission etc
 kerala kii krishi kaa itihaas naveen prastar yug se prarambh hota he
 Primitive agricultural practices like Punam Krishi were prevalent in ancient times
 adivaasiyon ke paas unki nijee krishi reetiyaan thim
 Ancient agricultural culture was an integral part of the various tools of agriculture, native seeds, methods of conservation of seeds, agricultural period, different types of agricultural lands and agricultural customs, agricultural rituals, agricultural festivals, agricultural songs etc
 kerala ke paas krishi se sambandhit deshi gyaan kaa bada bhandar he
 Kerala has special agricultural areas, such as Kuttanad, Palakkad, Kantallur, Nelliyampati etc
 krishi kshetra main duusare ullekhneey tatv hai - choti-bady jal-sinchan yojanaayen, jalaashyon ke vikaas kii yojanaayen aadi
 Fisheries and animal husbandry are also the main tasks of the agriculture sector
 naveen prastar yug main manushya krishi tathaa pashu paalan kii ore agrasar hua tha
 In those days, humans had two types of weapons - stone-made furs and tree sticks made of sticks
 kerala main bhi naveen prastar yugin krishi rahi hogi, kyonki sahyadri ke kuch kshetron se tej dhar vaale prastar - farse praapt hue hai
 The stones which were received from the banks of Tirunelli and Bavalippusha in Wayanad and from a place called Putatti are of this stone age
 pashupaalan tathaa pahad kii taraaiyon ke jhaad-jhankhad kaat-chhant kar kheti karnaa naveen prastar yugin krishakon kii jivan style thim
 There may have been new stone age farming at similar locations in the Western Ghats
 isi yug main dhan, fal, kandamul aadi ko bhojan main pramukhataa mili hogi
 The use of iron began in South India a thousand years before Christ
 kerala main bhi loh yug aarambh hua hoga
 Changes in the field of agriculture from the super era era mining are also visible
 lohe kii kudaalen, fawde, bijon kii sangrakshan ke liye prayukt mitti ke bade paatr aadi bhi in khudaayiyon main praapt hue hai
 Sangamam literary works, which are considered to be of great stone age, give a detailed presentation of the production process
 sanghamakaleen rachanaayen utpaadan prakriya se judy hai jo vibhinn jan-jatiyon kaa vivaran bhi detii hai
 In those days people who made agriculture a livelihood were called Vellalars
 kerala main vellalar ko vishisht jati vibhaag ke rup main nahin mana jaataa he
 Here the farmers have not been considered as belonging to any particular caste
 baad main waiter or ir varg ke log bhi krishi karm karne lage
 Seeing the fertility of the river banks, the waiters, Ayer, Kurwar etc
 settled there
 ve log kaalaantar main halwale or pulyar kahalaane lage
 The word 'pulam' means land
 krishi pradesh ko 'menpulam' tathaa uske chaaron ore ke pahari pradesh jahaan krishi nahin kii jaati, 'vanpulam' kehete the
 'mainpulum' signified the development of primitive agriculture
 yadhyapi sangham sahitya krishi kaa vistrut varnan prastut karata he tathaapi inamen utpaadan ke parinaam kaa koi ullekh nahin he
 It is also not clear whether agriculture of that period could sustain a large population
 sanghamakaleen paanch 'tinkal' roopi bhoomi ke vibhaajan kii pariklpana bhi pracheen krishak - jivan kaa chitra prastut karti he
 The next phase of the history of agriculture is after the arrival of people of Buddhist, Jain, Brahmin etc
 religion to Kerala
 buddha dharm krishi kii prerana detaa tha
 When the Brahmins settled on the river bank, they took possession of agriculture
 kheton kaa bada hissaa brahmanon ke graamon main aa gaya
 The reason for the Brahmins gaining dominance over farming was their astrological knowledge, on the basis of which they formulated a plan of agriculture and kept control of it
 mandiron kii sthapana ke dwaara unhone zamin par apana aadhipaty jamaaya
 In this way, they gained control of agricultural production even without doing agriculture directly
 is se utpaadan vyavastha main bhi parivartan aayaa
 The people called Ushwar, people of the general department, were divided into several subdivisions
 karalar, kutical, atiyaar pramukh up vibhaag ban gaye
 The major cultivators came to be known as Kaler
 krishi bhoomi ke mandiron ke naam ho jane se karalar brahmanon ke adheen ho gayi
 Those living in the fields were called Kutima or Kutianma
 nimnatam adiyaar kehalaae gaye
 Adiyanma or the slave class had no authority over the land
 ve apane swami ke liye mehnat - mazaduri karne ko baadhya the
 Foreign travelers arriving in medieval Kerala have mentioned crops like black pepper, ginger etc
, in their journeys
 17 veen shatabdi main europea logon ne kerala main sthaayee nivas shuru kiya tha
 Then the aromatic spice trade also flourished
 isi yug main videshiyon kii priy fasalon ke bagan bhi viksit hue
 The pepper trade grew in the 18th century
 kerala main kaashew, ananas, chote katahal, aalu, lambe kele aadi kii krishi europiyon dwaara prachlit kii gayin thi
 Cultivation was started in the 19th century by clearing some sites in Tiruvitankur
 isi yug main samudratati kshetron main bhi krishi kaa prachlan hua
 In the 19th century, the British Company made coffee, tea and cardamom plantations in the hills of Thiruvitankur and Wayanad
 british baganon ke dekha-dekhi deshi logon ne sahyadri main pravesh kar krishi aarambh kii
 In the late 19th century and early twentieth century, a large part of the mountainous areas became gardens
 vaynad ke adhikansh baganon ke maalik jaindharmee gunder the
 The people of Madhyatiruvitankur also built gardens in Wayanad
 dhire - dhire kalimirch kii vyapaarik mahatva ghatata gaya or duusari vastuen pramukh ban gayin
 The industrial sector of Kerala consists of large-scale large industries, medium industries and small industries, Khadi village industries, artisan industries etc
 kerala ke paramparaagat udyogon main pramukh kayar udyog he
 Handloom and cashew are followed by Coir
 bharat ke kayar utpaada main 35% or kayar se bane sadhano main 90% kerala se he
 Five lakh workers work in the coir sector
 iske atirikt us par duusare 10 lakh log avalbit hai
 About 2 lakh people work in the handloom industry
 khaperu, bidi, resham utpaadan, baans, bagan udyog aadi paramparaagat udyog ke antargat aate hai
 Modern industries started in Kerala in the mid-19th century
 british bagan maalikon tathaa german isai dharm prachaarkon ne inkaa aarambh kiya tha
 In 1859, the first coir factory in Kerala was established by an emir named James Dara in Alappuzha Nagar

 The above rule applies to all human actions, whether these actions have happened before or in the future
 manushya keval chetana se utpann prerana ke kaaran koi kaam kar saktaa he
 There is a fundamental connection between consciousness and the character of man
 chetana vah vishesh gun he jo manushya ko jivit banaati he or charitra uskaa vah sampurna sanghathan he jiske dwaara uske jivit rahane kii vaastaviktaa vyakt hoti he tathaa jiske dwaara jivan ke vibhinn kaary chalaae jate hai
 The consciousness and character of a human being are not only his personal property
 ye bahut dinon ke saamaajik prakram ke parinaam hote hai
 Each person presents their inheritance in themselves
 vah vishesh prakaar ke sanskaar paitrik sampatti ke rup main paata he
 He also represents history in itself, because he has found different types of education and training in life
 iske atirikt vah duusare logon ko bhi apane dwaara nirupit karata he, kyonki unka prabhaav uske jivan par unke udhaaharan, upadesh tathaa avapeedan ke dwaara padaa he
 Once man's consciousness develops, then his natural freedom is gone

 is prakaar manushya kii chetana athwa viveki man uske avchetan, athwa prakritik, man par apana niyantran rakhata he
 This is the special distinction between man and animal
 pashuon ke jivan main is prakaar kaa niyantran nahin rahata, atev jaisaa ve chaahate hai vaisaa karte hai
 Human being is a conscious creature, so before taking any action, he thinks well about its result
 manovigyaan kii drushti se chetana maanav main upasthit vah tatv he jiske kaaran use sabhi prakaar kii anubhutiyaan hoti hai
 It is because of consciousness that we see, hear, understand and think on many topics
 isi ke kaaran hamen sukh-du:kha kii anubhuti bhi hoti he or ham isi ke kaaran anek prakaar ke nishchay karte tathaa anek padaarthon kii prapti ke liye cheshtaa karte hai
 There are three characteristics of human consciousness
 vah gyanatmak, bhavatmak or kriyaatmak hoti he
 Indian philosophers have called it Sachchidananda form
 aadhunik manovaigyanikon ke vichaaron se ukt niropagya kii pushti hoti he
 Consciousness is the element in which there is a feeling of knowledge, of emotion and of person, that is, action
 jab ham kisi padaarth ko jaanate hai, to uske swaroop kaa gyaan hamen hota he, uske prati priy athwa apriy bhav paidaa hota he or uske prati ichha paidaa hoti he, jiske kaaran yaa to ham use apane sameep laate athwa use apane se dur hataate hai
 Consciousness has been considered as a self-illuminating element in philosophy
 manovigyaan abhi tak chetana ke swaroop main aage nahin bad sakaa he
 Consciousness makes all things, root conscious, body mind, inanimate living, brain, etc
, represent their nature
 phir chetana ko inke dwaara samajhane kii cheshtaa karnaa avichaar he
 According to the statement of Megadugal Mahasya, just as physical science has its own methods of thinking and special methods, in the same way, it has its own methods and methods of thinking about consciousness
 atev chetana ke vishay main bhautik vigyaan kii vidhiyon se na to sochaa ja saktaa he or na uske pradutt iske kaam main aa sakate hai
 Then physics itself has not been able to publish a definite opinion about the nature of its final units which are the basis of that science
 padaarth, shakti, gati aadi ke vishay main abhi tak kaamchalaoo jaankaree ho saki he
 The final decision has not been taken yet about his appearance
 atev chetana ke vishay main antim nirnay kii aashaa kar lenaa yuktisangat nahin he
 Explaining consciousness through unconscious elements, that is, adding a work-cause relationship to it, is downright indiscriminate
 chetana ko jin manovaigyanikon ne jad padaarth kii kriyaaon ke parinaam ke rup main samajhane kii cheshtaa kii he arthath jinhone ise shaareerik kriyaaon, snaayuon ke spandan aadi kaa parinaam mana he, unhone chetana kii upasthiti ko hi samaapt kar diya he
 He has eliminated the presence of consciousness
 pavalaaf or watasan mahoday ke chintan kaa yahi parinaam hua he
 According to his statement, thinking about mind or consciousness in psychology is futile
 manovigyaan kaa vishay manushya kaa drishyman vyavhaar hi hona chahie
 Psychologists have different opinions about the relationship in the body of consciousness
 kuch ke anusaar manushya ke brihat mastishk main honevaali kriyaaon, arthath kuch naadiyon ke spandan kaa parinaam hi chetana he
 It is not an independent element in itself
 dusron ke anusaar chetana swayan tatv he or uskaa sharir se aapasi sambandh he, arthath chetana main honevaali kriyaayein sharir ko prabhavit karti hai
 Sometimes the body is not affected by the actions of consciousness and sometimes the actions of the body do not affect consciousness
 ek mat ke anusaar sharir chetana ke kaary karne kaa yantra maatr hai, jise vah kabhi upyog main laati he or kabhi nahin laati
 But if the device deteriorates, or breaks down, then consciousness becomes crippled for its work
 kuch gambhir manovaigyanik vichaarkon dwaara vigyaan kii vartmaan pragati kii avasthaa main uparyukt mat hi sarvottam mana gaya he
 Three levels of consciousness are considered: conscious, subconscious and unconscious
 chetan str par ve sabhi baaten rahati hai jinke dwaara ham sochate samajhate or kaary karte hai
 Man's ego remains in consciousness and here is the organization of thoughts
 avchetan str main ve baaten rahati hai jinka gyaan hamen tatkshan nahin rahata, parantu samay par yaad kii ja sakati hai
 In the unconscious level, there are things which we have forgotten and which we do not remember even after our hard work and through special process which are reminded
 jo anubhutiyaan ek baar chetana main rahati hai, ve hi kabhi avchetan or achetan man main chali jaati hai
 These sensations are not completely passive, but continue to affect humans inadvertently
 chetana saamaajik vaataavaran ke sampark se viksit hoti he
 Man gets morality, justification and tact from the influence of environment
 ise chetana kaa vikaas kaha jaataa he
 At the height of development, consciousness realizes freedom
 vah saamaajik baton ko prabhavit kar sakati he or unase prabhavit hoti he, parantu is prabhaav se apane aapako alag bhi kar sakati he
 This kind of feeling of consciousness is addressed with the words pure Chaitanya or Pramata, Atma etc
