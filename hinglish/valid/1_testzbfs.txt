 This article is about 'swara' related to music
 maanav evam anya stanposhi praaniyon ke aawaaj ke bare main jaankaree ke liye dekhen - swar In music, a word that has a certain form and whose softness or intensity or fluctuations, etc
, can be easily guessed at the time of listening, is called swara
 bhartiya sangeet main saat swar hai, jinke naam hai - shadj, rishabh, gandhar, madhyam, pancham, dhaivat va nishad
 As such no number of vowels can be mentioned, but for convenience, seven vowels have been assigned in all countries and all times
 bharat main in saaton swaron ke naam kram se shadj, rishabh, gandhar, madhyam, pancham, dhaivat or nishad rakhe gaye hai jinke sankshipt rup sa, re ga, m, pa, dha or ni hai
 Scientists have proved by examining that a substance is produced by vibrating 256 times, Rishabh when vibrating 298 2 / 3 times, Gandhara vowel when vibrating 320 times; And likewise, the sound of Nishad comes out when vibrating 480 times
 taatpary yah ki kampan jitna hi adhik or jaldi jaldi hota he, swar bhi utana hi unchaa chadhataa jaataa he
 According to this sequence, the group of seven vowels from Shatj to Nishad is called Saptak
 ek saptak ke uparaant doosraa saptak chalata he, jiske swaron kii compansankhya is sankhya se dooni hoti he
 Similarly, there is also the third and fourth octave
 yadi prayek swar kii kapansankhya niyat se aadhi ho, to swar baraabar neeche hote jaayange or un swaron kaa samooh neeche kaa saptak kehalaayegaa
 In India it is also believed that these seven vowels are derived from the vowels of peacock, cow, goat, crouch, cuckoo, horse and elephant, that is, all these beings speak in these vowels respectively; And this number of vowels has been fixed on the emulation of these
 bhinn bhinn swaron ke uccharan sthaan bhi bhinn bhinn kahe gaye hai
 For example, nasal, throat, ur, palate, tongue and teeth arise in these six places because the first vowel is called conspiracy
 jis swar kii gati naabhi se sir tak pahunche, vah rishabh kehalaata he, aadi
 All these voices come out of the throat, but also emit in the same way
 in saaton main se sa or pa to shuddh swar kahalate hai, kyonki inkaa koi bhed nahin hota; par shesh paachon swar do prakaar ke hote hai - komal or teevr
 Each vowel is divided into two, three and three parts, each part of which is called 'shruti'
 vidwaanon ne mana he ki jo dhvaniyaan nishchit taal or lay main hoti hai vahiin sangeet paidaa karti hai
 Roughly two types of sounds, 'ahat' and 'anahat' sounds are not useful for music, they are experienced in meditation paradoxes, so music is born from the sound of 'ahata'
 yah naad do vastuon ko aapas main ragadne, gharshan yaa ek par duusari vastu ke prahaar main paidaa hota he
 The 'hurt' sound reaches us through vibration
 dhwani apni tarangon se hawa main halchal paidaa karti he
 The sound is decided to be high or low at the width and length of the sound waves
 sangeet ke saat swaron main ‘re’ kaa naad ‘sa’ ke naad se unchaa he
 Similarly, the sound of 'C' is higher than 'ray'
 yah bhi kah sakate hai ki ‘ga’ kii dhwani main tarangon kii lambaai ‘re’ kii dhwani–tarangon se kam he or compano kii sankhya ‘re’ kii tulana main zyada he
 Apart from this, there are many other theories related to sound which ensure that the sound is heavy or thin, late or short
 inhen gunon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sangeet ke liye mukhyatah saat swar nishchit kiye gaye
 They were called Sa, Re Ga, M, P, Dha and Ni by taking the first letter of the consonants, Gandhara, Madhyam, Pancham, Dhaivat and Nishad
 ye sab shuddh swar he
 Among these, 'sa' and 'P' are considered immovable because they do not move even a bit
 baaki paanch swaron ko vikrut yaa vikari swar bhi kehete hai, kyonki inamen apane sthaan se hatane kii gunjaaish hoti he
 If a vowel moves slightly below its assigned place, it is called a soft vowel
 or upar khisakta he to teevr swar ho jaataa he
 Then on returning to their place these vowels are said to be pure
 re, ga, dha, ni jab neeche khiskate hai tab ve komal ban jate hai or ‘m’ upar pahunchakar teevr ban jaataa he
 In this way, seven pure vowels, four soft and one intensified twelve vowels are prepared
 saat swaron ko ‘saptak’ kaha gaya he, lekin dhwani kii oonchaai or nichai ke aadhaar par sangeet main teen tarah ke saptak maane gayi
 Normal sound is called 'middle', middle to top sound is 'wire' and middle to bottom sound is called 'mandra' octave
 ‘taar saptak’ main taalu, ‘madhya saptak’ main galaa or ‘mandra saptak’ main hriday par jor padataa he
 The great musicians of modern-day music, Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar and Pandit Vishnunarayan Bhatkhande developed the method of writing the Indian music tradition
 bhatkhande ji ne saptakon ke swaron ko likhane ke liye bindu kaa prayog kiya
 The point above the vowel indicates the chord octave, below the vowel the mandra octave and the pointless vowel indicate the middle octave
 in saptakon main komal or teevr swar bhi gaaye jate hai, jinhen bhatkhande lipi main swaron ke upar khadi pai lagaakar teevr tathaa swaron ke neeche pat pai lagaakar komal darshaya jaataa he
 Only the level of sound of these vowels changes
 inaki komalta or tivrata bani rahati he
 In music, the tone has to be tied to the rhythm
 lay bhi saptakon kii tarah teen str se guzarati he jaise saamaanya lay ko ‘madhya lay,’ saamaanya se tej lay ko ‘drut lay’ tathaa saamaanya se kam ko ‘wilimbit lay’ kaha jaataa he
 The rhythm is formed by dividing time in equal amounts in music
 ‘taal’ baar-baar doharaaya jaataa he or har baar apane antim tuqade ko puraa kar samay ke jis tukade se shuru hua tha usee par aakar miltaa he
 Each piece is called a 'quantity'
 sangeet main samay ko maatra se mapa jaataa he
 There are 16 pieces or quantities of time or rhythm in three rhythms
 har tukade ko ek naam diya jaataa he, jise ‘bol’ kehete hai
 These words, when played on an instrument, are called 'contract'
 ‘taal’ kii matraaon ko vibhinn bhaagon main baanta jaataa he, jisase gane yaa bajaane vaale ko yah maaloom rahe ki vah koun si maatra par he or kitni matraaon ke baad vah ‘sam’ par pahunchega
 Their divisions are done according to the verses of the Bols in the Talas
 jahaan se chakra dobaaraa shuru hota he use ‘sam’ kaha jaataa he
 In 'tal', 'empty' 'filled' are two important words
 ‘taal’ ke us bhaag ko bhari kehete hai jis par bol ke hisaab se adhik bal dena he
 'bharis are clapped
 ‘taal’ main khaali um bhaag ko kehete hai jis par tali nahin di jaati or jisase gayak ko sam ke aane kaa abhas ho jaataa he
 The rhythm knots the rhythm and keeps it under its control
 jab 12 swar khoj liye gayi honge tab unhen istemaal karne ke tareeke dhunde gayi
 Many ragas were composed by the combination of 12 vowels
 unamem se kai raagon main samanta bhi thi
 Poet Lochan mentions 16 thousand ragas in the book 'raga-tarangini', but out of so many ragas, there were only 16 ragas in circulation
 raag us swar samooh ko kaha gaya jisamen swaron ke utaar-chadhaav or unke mail main banane vaali rachana sunne vaale ko mugdh kar sake
 It is not necessary that any raga has seven voices
 yah to bahut pehle hi tay kar diya gaya tha ki kisi bhi raag main kam se kam paanch swaron kaa hona jaruri he
 More such rules were made as if it is very important to have 'sa' in every raga because that is the basis of every raga
 kuch swar jo raag main baar-baar aate hai unhen ‘vaadi’ kehete hai or aise swar do ‘vaadi’ swar se kam lekin anya swaron se adhik baar aaen unhen ‘sanvaadi’ kehete hai
 Lochan poets found similarities in many of the 16 thousand ragas and put them in different classes
 unhone 12 varg taiyaar kiye jinamein se har varg main kuch-kuch samaan swar vaale raag shaamil the
 These classes were called 'mail' or 'thaat'
 ‘that’ main 7 swar arthath ‘sa’, ‘re,’ ‘ga’, ‘m’, ‘pa’,‘dha’, ‘ni’, hone aavashyak he
 It is another thing that a 'thaat' will have soft and some will have strong or mixed vowels
 in ‘thaton’ main vahi raag rakhe gayi jinke swar milte-julate the
 After this, in the seventeenth century, South scholar Pandit Srinivas thought that ragas should be placed in 'mela' from the number of their vowels, i
e
 the ragas which have 5 vowels in one 'mela', the other with six vowels and 7 vowels
 In the third 'mail'
 kai vidwaanon main is baat ko lekar charchaa hoti rahi ki raagon kaa vargeekaran ‘melon’ main kaise kiya jaye
 Another scholar, Vyankatmakhi from the south, gave a total of 72 'mails' by resorting to mathematics
 unhone dakshin ke raagon ke liye inamen se 19 ‘mail’ chune
 Here scholars in North India chose 32 'mails' for all the ragas
 antatah bhatkhandaji ne yah tay kiya ki uttar bhartiya sangeet ke sabhi raag 10 ‘melon’ main samaa sakate hai
 This 'mail'
 koun-koun se hai inhen yaad rakhane ke liye ‘chatur pandit’ ne ek kavita banaai
 The clever Pandits were none other than Pandit himself
 inhone kai rachanaayen ‘manjarikar’ or ‘vishnu sharma’ naam se bhi rachi he
 In North Indian music, from 'kalyan Thaat' or 'yemen Thaat' to Bhupali, Hindol, Yemen, Hamir, Kedar, Chhayanat and Gaudasrang, 'bilawat Tha' to Bihag, Dekhkar, Bilawal, Pahadi, Durga and Shankara, 'khamaj That' Jhizhoti, Tilang, Khamaz, Rageshwari, Sorath, Desh, Jayajayanti and Tilak Kamod, Ahir Bhairav from 'bhairav thaat', Gunakali, Bhairav, Jogia and Meghranjani, Puriyadhanashri from 'eastern Thaat', Vasant and Eastern, Bhimplasi from 'khati Thaat' , Peelu, Coffee, Bageshwari, Bah Su, Vrindavani Sarang, Shuddha Mallah, Megh and Mian's Malhar, Jaunpuri from 'asavari Thaat', Darbari Kanhara, Asawari and Adana, Malkons from 'bhairavi Thaat', Bilaskhani Todi and Bhairavi, 'todi That' Multani and 'marwa That' produced Bhatiyar, Vibhas, Marwa, Lalit and Sohni Agni Raga
 aaj bhi sangitajna inhen das ‘‘thaton’ kii madad se naye-naye raag bana rahe hai
 It is worth noting here that every 'thaat' is named after a particular raga originating from it
 is raag ko ‘aashray raag’ kehete hai kyonki baaki raagon main is raag kaa thodaa-bahut ansh to dikhaai hi detaa he
 The word 'raga' is derived from the Sanskrit metal 'ranj'
 ranj kaa arth he - rangana
 Just as a painter fills the picture and makes it beautiful, in the same way, the musician paints the mind and body with musical notes
 rang main rang janaa muhaavarey kaa arth hi he ki sab kuch bhulaakar magan ho janaa yaa leen ho janaa
 Music has the same effect
 jo rachana manushya ke man ko anand ke rang se rang de vahi kaag kehalaati he
 Each raga has its own form, a personality that depends on the vocals and rhythms it takes
 kisi raag kii jati is baat se nirdhaarit hoti hai ki usamen kitne swar hai
 Aaroh means ascending and descending of descent
 sangeet main swaron ko kram unki oonchaai-nichaai ke aadhaar par tay kiya gaya he
 The sound of 'sa' is higher than 'ray', 'C' is higher than 'ray' and 'ni' is the highest
 jis tarah ham ek ke baad ek seedhiyaan chadhate hue kisi makaan kii upree manzil tak pahonchte hai usee tarah gayak sa-re-ga-m-pa-dha-ni-saan kaa safar tay karte hai
 This is called 'mount'
 iske vipareet upar se neeche aane ko 'avaroh' kehete hai
 Then the order of the vowels is from higher sound to lower sound like saan-ni-dh-pa-m-g-re-sa
 aaroh-avaroh main saaton swar hone par raag ‘sampoorn jati’ kaa kehalaata he
 The raga on sound of five voices is called 'audava' and on the sound of six voices, it is called 'rag'
 yadi aaroh main saat or avaroh main paanch swar hai to raag ‘sampoorn audav’ kehalaayegaa
 In this way, a total of 9 castes can be prepared, which are also known as sub-castes of raga
 saadhaaran ganit ke hisaab se dekhen to ek ‘that’ ke saat swaron main 484 raag taiyaar ho sakate hai
 But in all, only one and a half hundred ragas are prevalent
 maamla bahut pechida lagata he lekin yah keval saadhaaran ganit kii baat he
 If there are 7 vowels in Aroh and 7 Vowels in Avroha, a 'whole-whole caste' is formed, so that only one raga can be formed
 vahiin aaroh main 7 or avarog main 6 swar hone par ‘sampoorn shadav jati’ banati he

 If all had been well


 it would have been timely, the book edited by Jagdish Kashyap on short stories in the twentieth century and Hindi short story would have been noticed by readers in the first year of this century
 It is possible that its form would have been different and the title would have been different

 He had spent countless nights in Kali for writing short stories, for his formal grooming
 isi ke liye hajaaron baar bacchon kii shikaayatein, patni kii jhidkiyaan, rishtedaaron kii khatpat bhi unhen sahani padi hogi
 Due to the short story, he got very famous, the love of readers, the friendship of allies, so due to this he also had to face the feud of enemies
 And yes, it was through the short story that he received the blessings of Khalil Jibran, who made him arrogant and pompous by nature
 unki kalam ko nae tevar die or sthitiyon ko gaharaai se parakhane kaa salika bhi
 yah baat alag he ki apane guru jaisi darshaniktaa tathaa sutikshn bhavvodh ve apni rachanaaon main kabhi nahin laa sake

 Jagdish Kashyap was not the victim of this weakness alone, but the fate of all those who wanted to touch his peak, riding on the shoulders of the short story movement
 sabhi apane-apane mandal ke maseehaa, swayan ko apni kaksha kaa martand samajhane vaale the
 In the case of Jagdish Kashyap, it may be a different story that, stung by his sharp writing, the paper writers also took the literary criticism on a personal level, the rhetoric of frivolity on both sides, detour of courts, misuse of creativity, sensations In the name of mockery, factionalism and plagiarism, Nikhalis politics has been going on for years, which the ordinary reader watches with little surprise and deep depression
 parinaam yah hua ki jin logon ke kandhon par chadhakar laghukatha andolan paravaan chadha tha, unheen kii jid, vyaktigat mahattvakankshaon, kunthaon or adaavaton ne is andolan ko dubaara jameen par laane main koi kasar nahin chodi

 This is perhaps the only example of its kind in Hindi literature
 to bhi is baat par sabhi sahamat honge ki jagadish kashyap ne apana sangharsh or srujanaatmakataa se bhare kai mahatvapurn varsh laghukatha ko samarpit kar die
 He has also contributed to the creative aspect of the short story as well as to clarify its concept
 jagadish kashyap ne hindi ko na keval kai nayab laghukthakaar die
 As well as writing short stories from writers who have gathered in other genres, worked to underline his work, there are also examples of his might, when many litterateurs migrating from the field of short stories due to lack of criticism Appeared

 As he became indifferent, because of his frustrations or because of some other pressure, the edge of his pen was frustrated, then the heat of the short story movement also went away
 uski tejaswita gaayab ho gai
 Jagdish Kashyap himself suffered this tragedy on a double level
 One was the inability to write, which had broken them within, and the other, the pain of deviating from their goal of the short story movement, due to which the readiness of the development of the short story review was seen in those days
 The ideas expressed in the articles could not move forward
 or to or in yatra-tatra bikhare hue vichaaron kaa salike se sangyojan kar kisi taarkik parinti par pahunchane kaa kaam bhi nahin ho paaya
 It is also true that with Jagdish Kashyap's seriousness towards the short story, his name was hardly connected with any other short story, at least not in western Uttar Pradesh and Delhi Circle; Although he did not write short stories in terms of numbers
 Nor has he done very remarkable work on the review of short story, which can prove to be a milestone in this field
 tathaapi jo kiya usase unki lekhkeey eemaandaaree or abhivyakti kii moulikta siddh hoti he
 Jagdish Kashyap's contribution to the field of short story is about the fundamental concept of short story
 unase pehle tak laghukatha apni pahchaan ke liye sangharsh karti aa rahi thi
 When a lot of questions were raised about the size and shape of the short story, he also started working on the review of short story with creative writing
 un dinon laghukatha or kahani ke vaibhinnya ko darshane ke liye adhikansh vidwaan shabd sankhya ko aadhaar bana rahe the
 Jagdish Kashyap emphasized the qualitative features of the short story, which was far more logical
 jise kalantar main sabhi ne sweekaara bhi
 jo ho jagadish kashyap ne laghukatha ke akalan ke liye jo kasuti viksit kii, usapar sabase pehle apni hi rachanaaon ko ksaa
 or jo rachanaaen unhen us kasuti par kamjor padati dikhaai deen, unhen apane rachanakshetra se nirmamtapurvak bedakhal kar diya
 The extracted short stories are not in any of his short collections today
 jo vyakti apni rachanaaon ke prati itnaa nirmam ho saktaa he, vah dusron ko kyon bakhshane laga
 so unhone kathortapurvak apni kasuti par dusron kii laghukthaon ko kasnaa prarambh kar diya
 This work was going to give rise to controversies, so those editors at that time provoked Jagdish Kashyap who wants to keep himself in the discussion on one pretext, through his controversy or shocking journalism
 aise sampadakon ne unhen apni patrikaon or saptahikon ke kalam saunp die
 Just from here, disputes started entering his life
 At that point of time, there could also be a glorification in his mind to consider himself as the Messiah
 lekin iske liye jagadish kashyap ke saath-saath ve sampadak-patrkaar bhi doshi the, jo unhen uksaakar badi chaturaai se unka istemaal kar rahe the
 The field of review cannot be said to be more favorable to an honest and flat-witted person like Jagdish Kashyap
 Especially in an environment where the writer is the critic and the critic is confused about being a creative writer
 Where there is a lack of objectivity and the condition of further review from the minorities is not very satisfactory
 jahaan samikshakarm kaa aashay ek-duusare kii qamar khujane tak simit ho, jahaan samvednaaen raajnneeti kii taraazoo par tauli jaati hon
 kashyap ji jaise munhfat lekhak ke liye to haragij nahin
 yahaan vahi namavari ganth saktaa he jisaki patibaddhta har roj rang badalati ho
 Whoever goes to the stage, who eats it, praises the same, should perform the aarti of him
 Kashyap ji's fame in the field of short stories is also because he started writing short stories at a time when he was not recognized as a genre, he adopted this genre with all sincerity
 However, he himself was also a victim of confusion
 inamen sabase adhik sanshay is nai vidha ke naam ko lekar bhi tha
 In the initial phase of the short story movement, this new, sharp and flamboyant genre was being given new names
 koi ise laghukahani naam dena chahta tha to kuch kathika, laghuvyangy, kahani se alag vidha, minikatha, vyangyakatha aadi naamon se navaj rahe the
 Kashyap himself was not so sure about this
 unhone angreji short story kii tarj par ‘minikatha’ naam bhi manjuur kiya tha
 He also gave the name 'miniyug' to his magazine with this concept
 kintu vakt ke saath-saath baaki naam peeche chhutate chale gaye or laghukatha naam ko sabaki manyata mil gai
 The success of the short story movement was that the name of the short story gradually rose on everyone's tongue and the rest of the names were left far behind
 iske falswaroop ve log jo is vidha ko nayaa naam dene kaa shrey lenaa chaahate the, thande padate chale gaye
 We can also give some credit to Kamleshwar and Ramesh Battra, by extracting Sarika's short story special, he inadvertently threw out the politics of politics and meaningless debates about the name
 sahitya main jagadish kashyap kaa padaarpan bhi us samay ke duusare sahityakaron kii tarah kavita ke madhyam se hi hua tha
 The days when he came in the field of literature, certainly that time was not of short story
 vah hindi kii sammanit vidha to haragij nahin thi, balki use vidha maanane waalon kaa sire se abhaav tha
 Most even refused to accept him as a genre
 phir koun si aisi baat rahi hogi jo unhen laghukatha ke kshetra main laai
 jiske kaaran vah itani gambhirtha ke saath laghukatha se jud sake
 He himself did not write anything about it
 But with his dedication and struggle, he was able to make the short story an alternative gateway to literature
 anek sahityakaron ne sahitya main pehali dastak laghukatha ke madhyam se di
 Jagdish Kashyap was certainly not alone in that movement
 koi bhi andolan kisi akele ke kandhon par chalakar kamyaabi nahin paa saktaa
 prithviraj aroda, satishraj pushkaranaa, ramesh battara, balram, satish dube, sukesh saahani jaise anek patibaddh laghukthakaron ke naam meri smriti main aa rahe hai, jo kahin par unke sahyogi kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe the to kahin par unki bhoomika samanaantar andolan ke vaahak kii thi
 All of them were working on creative writing in the short story as well as developing its review
 yani laghukatha kii avadharana ko tay karne, uske liye nae maapdand banane ke kaam ko lekar ek spardhaa kaa vaataavaran un dinon bana hua tha, jo swaabhaavik hi tha
 He also dominated the movement due to his dedication to the short story, honest and his impeccable comments
 rahaa abhivyakti ke liye keval laghukatha ko madhyam banane kaa kaaran? iske sutara unke jivan se talashne kaa prayaas kiya ja saktaa he
 If you look at the life of Jagdish Kashyap, then there is only an atmosphere of conflict and instability
 dhyaan rahe ki asthirataa kisi bhi vyakti ko thaharkar sochane or phir usapar amal karne kaa avasar nahin detii
 parivaar main ashaanti, phir padhai ke liye sangharsh 


kuch mitra iskaa zikr chhidane par ek shabdabimb kaa sahaara lete hai
 


 a small cell in a narrow street
 Which barely has a bunk place
 kitabon or patr-patrikaon ko sahejane ke liye charpai ke baraabar main hi ek stool kii jagah or nikaali gai he
 Working during the day, writing and reading, friends should also have a place to sit, that's why the bunk is thrown out of the room as soon as dawn and cloth is spread on the floor
 Which would have left a place to sit and work after beating the palathi
 If a friend or relative is to come, he has to sit on the floor
 vaise bhi ek berozegaar yuvak se jisane jaise-taise bi
 e
 kii pariksha paas kii he or ab akele apane dam par em
 e
 main baithne kii taiyaari kar rahaa he, milane koun aana chahega
 sivaay usee ke jaise berozegaron, faqamast logon ke
 For him, even that tarnished piece of floor and tots on the floor was no less than a silk carpet
 usee par virajman ek thigana, shyaamle varna kaa yuvak gardan jhukaae, patr-patrikaon par pen se nishaan lagaataa, unki katings, pathakon-prashansakon ke patron ko ytn purvak sahejataa rahata he
 If disputes arise in the same room, then their solutions are also found within the scope of that
 ek tuuti-si cycle bhi he, jisapar chadhakar vah akelaa yaa kisi mitra ko lekar nikal jaataa he
 To meet authors-readers or to raise funds for magazines
 In the era of this story, getting married as soon as adolescence is not a big deal
 But he is thankful that he is still far away from this mess
 ghar main bhi shanti nahin, isliye uske raat or din isi kothri ke saath bandhe hue hai
 When there is nothing to do anywhere else, the literary passion becomes a good medium to spend time, through which work can be done to cover your anger
 jagadish kashyap kii yuvavastha kaa yah bimb mujhe itane logon ne kai-kai baar dikhaaya he ki ab to apni hi ankhon main basii kisi tasviir jaisaa mahasoos hota he
 Obviously, that young man does not see anything in his present
 Circumstances provoke anger in his mind
 aise main khalil jibran usko disha dete hai
 

that bothered her anger 


 increases her spirits
 vah sthitiyon ke pramanik bhavchitra khinchataa he, usamen apane jivan kii talkhi ko undell detaa he
 He has learned from Khalil Jibran to fight the pen with weapons
 vah is baat se inkaar bhi nahin karata
 khalil jibran hi hai jinaki prerana usase saraswatiputra, blikeharse, varshadan, darpakaal, aakhri khamba jaisi laghukathaayen likhva le jaati he
 But Jagdish Kashyap is only Jagdish Kashyap, not Khalil Gibran
 Neither their circumstances and family responsibilities give them this opportunity
 haa, use jeene kaa prayaas ve aaajeevan karte rahe
 In this effort, he confessed to enmity of some who did not know
 vair-bhav saadhaa
 yahaan tak ki mukademe bhi lade
 Life-long struggles, defeats, shortages and long disappointments may have forced them to take shelter in literature
 usee daur main unka saakshaat kisi mode par khalil jibran se hua hoga
 The same proved to be the transformative phase of his life, Khalil Gibran once rode on his mind and heart, then did not spend his life
 But it was not easy to handle the life, spirit and deep philosophical life in a large composition like him
 or agar sambhala bhi jaae to uske liye pathakon kii samasya hoti
 shaayad isiilie swayan khalil ne bhi choti rachanaaen likhi thim, jo ek tarah se gadhygit hai
 It was a sutra that gave direction to Jagdish Kashyap's writing
 or jise aage chalakar unhone ek andolan ke rup main apanaaya
 One thing that sets Jagdish Kashyap apart from his contemporary short story writers is that he expressed it in words with the same honesty and frankness as he thought
 kabhi parinaam kii parvaah nahin kii
 a fire broke out in protest against the policies of the government while in a government job
 Written in local newspapers under a pseudonym
 His comments created a furore
 akhbaar ke sampadak jo un tippaniyon ko maje le-lekar chhapate or unke madhyam se dabaav banane kii raajnneeti karte the, khud par dabaav aayaa to pasinaa-pasinaa ho gaye
 Gaj fell on Kashyap ji
 The result was suspended 


 Living in the place where you were in the job, would have been a proof of being lucky
 nayaa aayaa rangarut bhi saal-bhar main apana scooter tathaa paanch-chah saal main apana makaan kharid letaa
 kashyap ji jindagi-bhar ek tuuti-puraani cycle par chalate rahe
 He could not buy the house even when he breathed
 And when you go, the bundles of debt are loaded on the head
 He was fond of alcohol, but the reason for the loan was the loan given to friends and colleagues
 madad karnaa unke swabhaav kaa hissaa ban chukaa tha
 Another example is associated with the editing of this book
 jis samay is pustak ke liye rachana sanchayan kaa kaary chal rahaa tha, tab bich main ek laghukatha ek aise sahityakar kii aa gai, jiske saath kashyap ji kaa jhagada chalata aa rahaa tha
 Long litigation had also taken place between the two
 us samay ham donon ke atirikt vahaan par subhash chander bhi the
 We used to think that Kashyapji is not sure of taking the author's work
 kintu hairaani tak hui jab kashyapaji ne us lekhak kii laghukatha na keval apane sankalan main sammilit kii saath main yah tippanee bhi ki vah aadmi haalanki aadmi ganda he, lekin uskaa kaam use is pustak main shaamil karne kaa hakdaar banaata he
 He also praised the creation of another short story with a free voice, incidentally he was also of his rival camp
 visangati dekhie ki jab us laghukthakaar ne laghukthaon kaa ek sankalan taiyaar kiya to jagadish kashyap kaa usamen naam tak nahin tha
 This is to say that the politics of rejecting his contribution started long ago
 dhyaan rahe ki in ruthe hue lekhakon main se adhikansh vahi the jinaki rachanaatmakataa par sawaal khadey karne kaa dussahas jagadish kashyap ne kiya tha
 a letter addressed to Prithviraj Arora may be a mirror to his entire personality
 yah patr: kathasansar ke laghukatha visheshank main prakashit ho chukaa he
 The fluidity of the personality and its roughness are clearly visible in the letter
 patr main kashyap ji likhte hai- Dear Arora, navvarsh kii vadhai, tumhen nahin bhabhi or bacchon ko
 The reason is not clear in itself
 tumhaara teen na teraa sangrah mere saamne he
 
 philhal miniyug ke aakhri dashak visheshank main juta hum
 is sangrah main tumne kai bhayankar galtiyaan kii hai

 Jagdish Kashyap
 patr se ham jaan sakate hai ki upar se munhfat or balos dikhne vaala vah insaan bheetar se gangaajal jaisaa hi pavitra tha
 This letter is also sufficient to show an accurate picture of the wobbly mood of Jagdish Kashyap in later years
 isamen ve daawey main hai jo ve na likh paane kii pidaa se guzarate hue, kabhi miniyug kaa aglaa ank nikaalane to kabhi nae upanyaas par kaam karne ke bahaane karte rahete the
 There is also his cleanliness in it, which was seen crossing the limits of decency in his taluk
 kintu isamen sabase zyada or mahatvapurn he, unki lekhkeey eemaandaaree
 satya kii sthapana ke liye yahi anivaary tatv he
 This can be the hallmark of any true critic, true litterateur
 jagadish kashyap apane lekhkeey jivan main prarambh se lekar ant tak laghukatha ke prati samarpit rahe
 He faithfully started the short story recitation from the poetry forums, which was well appreciated
 apni vidha ke prati itnaa itnaa anuraag, itnaa samarpan virale sahityakaron main hi dekhne ko miltaa he
 Ironically, our literary society was unable to understand Jagdish Kashyap's contribution in the field of short story
 laghukatha ke idhar jo sankalan un ‘mahaan’ laghukthakaron ne sampadit kiye hai, unamem jagadish kashyap ke naam kaa ullekh tak na hona jahaan un sahityakaron kii maansikta ko darshane ke saath-saath sahitya ke naam par chalane vaali gandi raajnneeti kii ore bhi ishaara karata he, jiskaa sabase adhik nuksaan sahitya or uske madhyam se samaaj ko hi uthaanaa padataa he
 Stray literature is unable to lead the society, to establish any kind of ideal, as a result of such people who want to do their own self-interest by making society wise
 meri nigaah main jagadish kashyap un chand gine-chune sahityakaron main the, jinhone hindi laghukatha ko samrudh karne, use swatantra vidha ke rup main manyata dilaane ke liye athak sangharsh kiya
 Like a dedicated fighter, he was engaged - lifelong, leading the short story movement
 Introducing his creative brilliance, he wrote unique short stories, marking good short stories
 

unke rachanakaaron ko ji kholkar saraahaa to nakalchi or gairjimmedaar laghukthakaron ko bina laag-lapet ke fatkaaraa bhi
 iske liye koi unhen laghukatha kaa paharua kahata he to koi laghukatha kaa lathait
 sach to yah he ki ve jab tak jiye, laghukatha kaa paryaay banakar rahe
 This critique of his words 'do not become the tomb of the critics' continued to inspire him in the struggle
 khalil jibran ko apana saahitiyik guru maanane vaale jagadish kashyap ko apni safagoi or bebaak tippaniyon ke liye chautarafa aalochanaon kaa saamana bhi karnaa padaa
 baavjood iske laghukatha lekhan-samiksha ke liye unhone jo kasuti viksit kii use unke virodhiyon ne bhi kisi na kisi rup main sweekaara
 jinhone nahin sweekaara, ve koi moulik vikalp dene main asamarth rahe
 The creative brilliance of Jagdish Kashyap can only be gauged from the fact that if a compilation of fifty best short stories of Hindi is prepared, then it will be four to five short stories and that is no small achievement

 Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria was a Colombian drug lord
 kabhi "duniya kaa sabase bada apradhi" kaha jane vaala pablo escobar sambhawatah cocaine kaa abtak kaa sabase chalbaaj saudagar tha
 He is considered the richest and most successful criminal in world history because, in the year 1989, Forbes magazine declared Escobar as the seventh richest person in the world with an estimated personal wealth of US $ 25 billion
 uske paas asankhya lakjri awaas evam gaadiyaan thim or 1986 main usne colombia kii raajnneeti main pravesh karne kaa prayaas kiya, yahan tak ki usne desh ke 10 billian dollar ke rashtriya karj ko chukaa dene kii peshkash bhi rakhi
 kaha jaataa he ki pablo escobar ne ek baar safar karte samay garmi ke liye 2 million dollar kii nagdi rakam jala di thi
 Some of these stories and other notorious achievements made Escobar a master of the world of crime
 escobar kaa janm ek gramin kisaan, abel di jisas escobar or ek praathmik skool shikshika, hemilda gaviria ke ghar hua tha
 Pablo was one of six children in Escobar's home
 pablo or uskaa parivaar ek aise ghar main rahete the jahaan bijli nahin thi lekin pani kii suvidha thi
 He and his brother were once sent home from school because Pablo had no shoes
 escobar ne universidad di intiyokia main raajnneeti vigyaan kaa adhyayan kiya, lekin jab vah aavashyak fees jamaa nahin kar paaya to use majabuuran padhai roak deni paddy
 yahi vah samay tha jab usne kabr ke pattharon ko churaakar or unhen taskaron ke haathon bechakar kathith taur par apane aapraadhik karier kii shuruyaat kii
 uske bhai is baat kaa khandan karte hue yah daawa karte hai ki kabr ke pathar kabristaan ke maalikon ke paas se aaye the jinke clienton ne inaki dekh-rekh ke liye paise dena band kar diya tha or unka ek rishtedaar tha jo murtiyon kaa vaid vyapaar karata tha
 Pablo grew up as a cheater and started doing everything he could to make money — from doing petty scams with his gang to selling forbidden cigarettes and fake lottery tickets
 He even started looting cash from people coming out of the bank
 At the time he was only 20 years old and had become a full-fledged car thief
 In the early 1970s, he was a thief and a bodyguard, and before kidnapping and extorting a Medellin executive 100,000 before entering the drug trade Had raised the dollar
 safalataa kii sidhiyaan chadhate hue uskaa aglaa kadam tha bahu-karodpati evam pratibandhit taskar, alvaaro preto ke liye kaam karte hue ek karodpati bananaa
 apane samarpan or chal ke jariye, pablo us samay tak 22 varsh kii umr main hi ek karodpati ban gaya tha
 a book released by Pablo's brother, Roberto Escobar, "the Accountant's Story" discusses how Pablo rose from a state of poverty and oblivion to become one of the richest men in the world
 taarkik drushtikon se vishwa itihaas main sabase bada or sabase safal aapraadhik santhaan, medelin drug cartil kai baar ek din main 15 ton cocaine kii taskari karata tha, jisaki keemat sanyukt rajya america ke andar aadhe billian dollar se adhik thi
 According to Pablo's accountant, Roberto, his and his brother's business only cost $ 1,000 a week on rubber bands they bought to tie cash pits — and since they had so much black money that they could put it in the bank Could not even collect, then they deposited the cash pits in their warehouses, of which 10% per annum was destroyed as "waste", when the rats at night Sector bills entered the hundred dollar started to nibble
 1975 main, escobar ne apane cocaine ke kaarobaar ko badhanaa shuru kar diya
 yahan tak ki usne sanyukt rajya america main taskari ke ek saude ke liye swayan ek vimaan udaaya
 phir usne is vimaan ko tod diya or ise hesiyenda napolace main apane ek pashu-farm ke daravaaje ke upar lataka diya
 uski pratishtha tab or bad gayi jab 1975 main ek jane maane medelin dealer, fabio restrapo kii htya jahiraa taur par, escobar dwaara kar di gayi, jisase usne 14 kilo kharida tha
 Later, all of Restrepo's men were informed that they now work for Pablo Escobar
 may 1976 main escobar or uske kai aadamiyon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya or ecuador se ek baari boj ke saath medelin lautne ke baad unke paas se untalis pound safed paste paaya gaya
 Initially, Pablo unsuccessfully tried to bribe Medellin judges who were making a case against him
 iske bajaay, kai maheenon ke kanoonee takaraar ke baad pablo ne giraftaar karanevaale do adhikariyon ko maar daalaa or tab is maamle ko band kar diya gaya
 This was the time when he devised his way of dealing with the authorities, either bribing them or killing them
 roberto escobar kaa kahana he kii pablo is vyapaar main keval isliye utraa kyonki pratibandh itnaa khatarnaak ho gaya tha ki yatayaat ke liye mushkil khadi ho gayi thi
 He could earn far more money than a truck full of cocaine, 40 boxes of alcohol and cigarettes
 us samay koi bhi drug cartil nahin tha or sirf kuch drug bairan the, isiliye vahaan har kisi ke liye kaaphi maatra main vyapaar tha
 In Peru, he bought cocaine paste, which he refined in a lab built in a two-story house in Medellin
 apni pehali yatra ke dauraan, pablo ne £30 kii ek maamuli keemat kaa paste kharida, jo uske dwaara apane samrajya nirmaan kii disha main pehla kadam ban gaya
