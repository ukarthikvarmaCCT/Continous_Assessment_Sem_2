 The people of East Pakistan took to the streets in protest against many years of struggle and atrocities of the Pakistan Army and suppression of the Bangladeshi
 1971 main azaadi ke andolan ko kuchalane ke liye pakistani sena ne purvi pakistan ke vidroh par amada logon par jamkar atyaachaar kiye
 Millions of people were killed and countless women were looted

 Thus the social and economic disparities found in two parts of the same country and the tendency of enlightened people to control the power itself led to nationwide dissatisfaction and finally the formation of Bangladesh in 1971
 pakistan ke gathan ke samay pashchimi kshetra main sindhi, pathan, baloch or mujahiron kii badi sankhya thi, jabaki purv hisse main bengali bolne waalon kaa bahumat tha
 Although there was never a lack of political consciousness in the eastern part, but the eastern part could never get proper representation in the power of the country and always remained politically neglected

 Massacres were carried out in all the areas from where opposition was feared
 Even people were taken out of the houses and fryed with bullets
 1971 main purvi pakistan main lakhon mahilaon ke saath balaatkaar, atyaachaar kiya gaya or hatya kii gayi
 According to an estimate, such excesses were made with about four lakh such women, who committed acts of forced sexual relations with them, women in military cant as sex workers etc
 and acts like gang rape
 563 bengali mahilaon ko kaint ilaake main kar rakhaa tha kaidaladai ke pehle hi din se 563 bengali mahilaon ko dhaka ke dingi military kaint main kaid kar diya gaya tha

 Early Buddhism is not familiar with it, it is not mentioned in the Buddhist texts, but the Vaibhashikas and Sautrantikas were supposed to consider it complete, according to which the smallest last particle of the first four matter objects which cannot be further divided, is called an atom
 isame gandh, sparsh, pariman, sanyog, gurutv, dravatv, veg aadi gun samaaye rahete hai
 Being very subtle, its sense is not perceptible, to give an indication of its vulnerability, some macro doctrines have been given - "jallangargate bhanau yatsukamam drashte raja :, tasya shashtitamo part: atom: sa yumayate, balagrashatasibhagyasya shatdha kalatasya f", That is, the sixty-seventh part of the particle flying in the middle of the sunlight coming from the holes inside the house, or the thousandth of the last tip of the hair The part is called atom, practically in the vocabulary of Vaishyaks, the molecule is called the smallest size, due to the combination of molecules, triloculars, triangles, etc
, they become large, according to Jainism all things except soul and country are produced from muds, of all puddles
 There are atoms or molecules, each molecule encircles a region or space, the pupil is macro or micro, when it remains in a microbe, the numberless molecule is a The macro surrounds the molecule, the molecule is eternal, each molecule contains a type of juice, Smell, form, and two types of touch remain, these characteristics are not constant, nor are fixed for many molecules, two or more molecules which differ in properties of smoothness or roughness, together form a wobble, Each object is made up of the same type of atom, the molecule can develop its own motion, and this speed can be so rapid that in a moment it reaches from one end of the world to the other

 Temperature is the measure of the heat of an object
 arthath, taapmaana se yah pataa chalata he ki koi vastu thandhi he yaa garm
 For example, if the temperature of one object is 20 degrees and that of another object is 40 degrees, then it can be said that the second object is warmer than the first object
 ek anya udhaaharan - yadi bangalore main, 4 agast 2006 kaa ausat taapmaana 29 degree tha or 5 agast kaa taapmaana 32 degree; to bangalore, 5 agast 2006 ko, 4 agast 2006 kii apeksha adhik garm tha
 Based on the evolution of the molecular theory of gases, it is assumed that the temperature of an object is proportional to the average kinetic energy contained in the random motion of its microscopic particles

 Public knowledge of the term grew to a large extent in 1981 with the publication of Jan Harold Brunwand's book The Vanishing Hitchhiker, which led to public awareness of urban legends

 This person takes the same stance as the person requesting the lift

 The journey starts again, sometimes with complete silence and at some point further it seems to disappear only when the passenger vehicle is moving
 kai maamalon main, vaahan ke us muft savaar ke gantavy sthaan tak pahunchate hi vah sahyatri lupt ho jaataa he
 a common type of description above involves a vanishing hitchhiker who leaves an object in a car or borrows a garment on the pretext of escaping in the winter, seen departing like a normal traveler
 gaayab hone vaala sahyatri jate samay kisi tarah kii soochna bhi chhod ja saktaa he jisase vaahan chaalak ko baad main usase sampark karne kaa kathith rup se protsaahan miltaa he

 The beardsley-hankey survey obtained 79 written details of interviews with vanishing hitchhikers from across the US
 unhone bataaya: "chaar spasht rup se bhinn sanskaran paae gaye, jo vikaas or saar main spasht bhinnataaon ke kaaran alag pahachaane ja sakate the
 " inkaa varnan nimna prakaar se kiya gaya he: Beardsley and Hankey were particularly interested in one incident: the disappearance of the hitchhiker later identified as the late Mother Cabrini, the founder of the local Sacred Heart orphanage, who was given the title of future saint for her work
 done
 lekhakon kaa maananaa tha ki yah sanskaran 'bi' ke sanskaran 'di' main badalane kii jhalak dene vaala maamla tha
 Beardsley and Hankey concluded that version 'A' was closest to the original form of the story, which had all the essential elements of the legend
 unka maananaa tha ki sanskaran 'bi' or 'di', sthaniyakrut vividhtaayen thim, jabaki 'si' sambhavat: ek alag bhoot kii kahani ke rup main shuru hua jo kisi avasthaa par mul gaayab hone vaale sahyatri kii kahani main sammishrit ho gaya
 One of his findings certainly seems reflected in the continuation of the vanishing hitchhiker's stories: in the vast majority of cases, the hitchhiker is a woman and a lift-giver male

 The brewing of beer in developed countries is subject to legislation and taxation, which since the late 19th century moderation was largely confined to commercial operations
 baharhaal, britain kii sarkaar ne san 1963 main vidhi-nirmaan main chhot di, jiskaa anukaran karte hue 1972 main australia or 1979 main sanyukt rajya america ne gharelu kinvaswan ko lokapriy shauk banane ke liye kii anumati pradaan kar di
 The purpose of kinsavan is to convert the source of alcoholic sugar into a liquid liquid called sura and convert this liquid into an alcoholic beverage that undergoes the fermentation process under the influence of yeast
