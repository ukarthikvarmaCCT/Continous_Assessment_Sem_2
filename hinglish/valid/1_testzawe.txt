 Vedas are the origin of medicine
 vedon main, visheshat: atharvaveda main, shareeravigyaan, aushadhivigyaan, chikitsavigyaan, keetanuvigyaan, shalyavigyaan aadi kii richaayen uplabdh hai
 Charaka and Sushruta have two distinctions, as its separate surgery and physiotherapy

 Vata, Pitta, Kapha, on the basis of the five physical elements, are considered to be pathogenic causes
 kaha gaya ki sharir main inaki vishmata hi rog he evam samta aarogy
 Therefore, the remedy to eliminate odd defects was called medical
 iske aath ang maane gaye : kaay, shalya, shaalakya, bal, grah, vish, rasayan evam bajeekaran
 Infections in diagnosis as well as germ infection were also considered to be the cause of diseases

 Use of improper external substances should not result in accumulation of defects in the body, with the idea that during the food-making period, or at the same time of eating, their incremental prescriptions are used in food items, such as while making brinjal's bhaji
 The use of asafoetida and fenugreek and the addition of black pepper and salt in it before the consumption of cucumber, because it was believed that asafoetida, chilli, etc

 The theory was that even if medical treatment is not done, the defects are incurred

 Diagnosis is the primary part of medicine in Ayurveda
 desh kii vishalata evam jalwaayu kii vishmata hone se yahan aushadhvigyaan kaa bhi bada vikaas hua
 Therefore, the use of different drugs for the same type of fever was decided
 isi se nighantu main aushadhiyon kii bahulata evam bheshaj-nirmaan-granthon main prayog kii bahulata drushtigochar hoti he
 Knowledge of bodily functions such as blood circulation, respiration, digestion, etc

 Often, all the components were treated by surgery and surgery

 In this, the liver was considered to be the major organ of the body and its status was predicted
 sharir main pretadi kaa prakope rog kaa mukhya kaaran yaa vyaadhishaastra kaa aadhaar samajha jaataa tha tathaa pretadikon kaa ni:saran, puja paath aadi unke upachaar the
 Surgery was considered superior

 Hundreds of minerals and organic medicines were also used in the field of medicine
 tarpin, deodara, hingu, sarson, lobaan, erand, tel, khaskhas, anjir tathaa kuch vifailli vanaspatiyon kaa bhi prayog hota tha
 In a way, that scientific medicine originated from Greece from which modern western medicine emerged
 isa se 500 varsh purv se lekar rome rajya ke utthan tak yah isi desh main simit tha; iske pashchaat iskaa vikaas madhya asia, athens, italy aadi greece ke adhirajyon main bhi hua
 This included all the prevalent practices of the time

 The oath that Hippocrates had directed to the Vaidyas was impressive, such as - "" i will respect the gurus of medicine like my venerated homelands

 rogiyon kii bhalaai ke liye aushadhiprayog karunga, kisi ke ghaat athwa garbhpaat ke liye nahin
 i will keep secret things and practices of the sick, secret, etc
 "" The treatise called Shirovran of Hippocrates is notable
 usamen shirobhed kaa ullekh tathaa shirosthibhang kaa upachaar tathaa anya avyavon kaa shalopchaar bhi paaya jaataa he
 Other fractures and fractures were also successful treatments during that period
 us kaal main kisi vishesh rog ke visheshgy nahin hote the
 Everyone used to see all types of patients
 jahaan shalyachikitsa sambhav nahin hoti thi vahaan ve sharir ko pusht rakhane kaa upaay karte the, kyonki unka vishwaas tha ki sharir main swayan vranrodhak shakti he

 ]saanchaa:comics infobox sec / formcatsazca:comics infobox sec / genrecat Chacha Chaudhary is the character of a very popular Indian comics book, which was composed by the late cartoonist Pran Kumar Sharma
 unki comics hindi evam angrezi samet anya das bhartiya bhashaaon ke saath prakashit hoti he or das karod se adhik pratiyon kii bikri hoti he
 The Doordarshan serial, based on "chacha Chaudhary", was screened on a major channel with over 600 episodes, which marked its title role by actor Raghuveer Yadav
 "chachaa choudhary" kaa aagaman 1971 kii prakashit hindi patrika lotpot se hua tha
 Which soon gained immense popularity among children and elders
 diamand comics kii press relies baad, 10 se 13 umr ke bhartiya bacchon ke samooh dwaara sabase adhik manyata praapt lokapriy comics pustak kirdaaron main se ek mana gaya
 He was also given guest roles in other characters in the Diamond Comics series such as Billu, Pinky and Raman
 "chachaa choudhary" ko ek aam madhyamvargeey bhartiya ke rup main dikhaaya gaya he, yadhyapi krushkaya hone ke baavjood vah behad vilakshan buddhi ke bujurg aadmi maane jate rahe hai
 Since uncle is commonly called Uncle in English, the word "chaudhary" is referred to in Indian social perception as a big landowner or a very respectable person of a village or town
 chachaa choudhary ko amuman unako laal pagadi, ek lakdi kii chadi, ek westcot jinaki donon ore jeben ho, or ek jebgdi liye hue dikhaaya jaataa hai
 In some early comics fiction, he was shown in a traditional dhoti-kurta, which was later shown wearing pants and a shirt citing modern surroundings
 apni gharelu pahchaan swaroop unhen unki dharmapatni bini, raaket naamak ek vafaadaar evam saadhaaran kutta or ek bhimkaay sharir ke maalik jupitarvasi sabu ke saath unako dikhaaya jaataa
 Uncle Chaudhary is often seen eating gourd-filled watermelons, but mango has a lot of weakness, but whenever his wife flares him at home, he would go out with Sabu or rocket
 jab kabhi vah apni pagadi utaarte, to dikhaaya jaataa he ki vah puri tarah ganje hai
 It is known to all the people of the city that whenever Chacha Chaudhary goes out with his family, he never closes the door of his house; But till date no one has been successful in stealing their house
 haalaanki, kuchhek kahaniyon main, jab chachee ne ghar par taala lagaate dikhaaya gaya he
 After some time, if there is an itch on his head or nose, it is believed that something untoward is happening at his house
 apane yuva samay ke dauraan chachaa choudhary ko ek peshewar mukkebaaz ke rup main ullekh dekhne miltahai jinhen unki anuthe ranneeti or kushal mukkebaaji ke chalate tab avijit mana jaataa tha
 When asked about the inspiration of this syringe, Pran Sahab said, "there is a wise elder in every family
" vah apane saamaanya vivek se unke mushkilen hal karaate hai, magar ek parihaas bhare andaaj main
 And this humor is the foundation of my cartoons
 " Typically, Chacha Chaudhary is not shown to have a body of body like other comics superheroes, nor has he ever been seen using extraordinary powers or modern gadgets
 bajaay inke, vah apane "dimag ko kisi bhi super-computer se zyada paini athwa tej bataate", or ek lakdi kii chadi rakhte, jise musiibat main vah uddand badmaashon kii pitayee kar daalate
 Like Chacha Chaudhary's characterization, Pran Sahab has retained other characters, like middle-class families in the Indian suburbs of the 1970s and 1980s
 tathaa unke khalpaatr bhi saamaanya taur par bhrasht sarkari tantra ke log, chor, raah kinare gunde evam badmaash, chalbaaj tathaa thagbaj or sthaneey thag hi hote hai
 He not only fights with them but also helps the common man and also teaches them moral lessons and good behavior
 kai ghatnaon ke ant main zyaadaatar badmaash unas trast bhi khate hai
 Like ordinary middle class people, they also have to deal with daily problems
 par is bare main bhi praan sahab unki samasyaon ko chutki ke saath hal karte hue unhen prasannchit chehron jaise chamakdaar ankhon yaa muskaan ke saath vidaa karaate
 Sabu is actually a parasite who lives on the planet Jupiter, he is a very reliable companion of the uncle and shows his strength only when the time comes
 vah behad vishaal or majboot sharir kaa swami he, jiskaa kad 15 feet se zyada bataaya jaataa
 However, in most comics series, there have always been inconsistent arguments about its unexpected shape-type
 par kuch comics main apana kad saamaanya se kahin zyada sikod diya gaya tha
 As mentioned in some stories, he is pulled out of the lamp by uncle Chaudhary
 aamtaur par vah mahaj pahalawaanon kaa kachha, ek jodi kaan ke kundal or ek jodi gam-boot pahane dikhaaya jaataa
 But some later comics are also depicted wearing casual green pajamas
 sabu dwaara aajanm prithvi par chachaa ke saath rahane kaa tab nishchay karata he jab vah prithvi se vidaa hone dauraan chachee ke banaaye paraathon or halava jaise swaadisht vyanjan ke moh main pad jaataa he
 Sabu also has a twin brother, Daboo, and gives Sabu the gift of earrings as a demon that his mother gave him when he abandons Jupiter
 kacomixsar, jab kabhi sabu ko gussa aata he, to dur kahin ek jwalamukhi fatataa he 
 Whenever he would demonstrate his great strength, he shouted "hoo-huba!" Speaking of kuch samay baad use "jai bajrang bali" kehete dikhaaya gaya, jise mote taur par "jai hanuman" kaa hi anuwaad kaha jaataa he
 At the same time, some comics were told to eat 108 chapatis, 12 kg pudding and about 20 liters, which is his day-long dose
 usne vivaah bhi nahin kiya, or is mudde par hameshaa duuri hi rakhi
 Sabu, like his uncle, is neither more intelligent, nor is he very knowledgeable and clever, instead he is very dependent on his physical strength
 haalaanki, sajag rup main kaaphi chust he or kai baar usne chachaa kii jaan bachaane ke liye apni viraat takat or bijli jaisi furti kaa parichay bhi diya he, aksar jab badmaash chachaa ko maarane pahonchte to antim kshan main unke bich kud padataa
 In some stories, Sabu would sometimes act wisely, just like his uncle would
 sabe kaa ab tak kaa sabase bada dushman "raaka" he, usee ke kad or takat main baraabar, joki sanyogvash police se peechha chhudaane kii jaldbaaji main ek vishesh ayurvedic arq ko vish samajhakar pi jaataa he or ajar-amar ho jaataa he
 Uncle Chaudhary's wife, Beeni, is a heavy-bodied common housewife, a woman who runs her own rule at home and uses her household cylinder to smash the thieves
 unhen aksar polka bindi vaali chapaaidaar sari pahane dikhaaya jaataa or heirstil 1970 ke dashak kii hindi film abhinetriyon kii tarah rakhaa jaataa
 Although she has a lot of fame for her well-being despite her tender heart, but is also a caring wife, she often complains to the uncle about getting a gold bracelet for her or not to go outside, and most of her time is spent on Sabu
 She takes care of Sabu like a mother, despite cooking a lot of food for her
 ek kamicomics unako sabu kaa bhojan banane ke liye badi handi main kalchhi dikhaaya gaya or jise vah baad main chachaa se bhi zyada sneh se uskaa khaanaa parosati
 At the same time, a history of Aunt Beani is mentioned in a comicsix how she used to live in her time
 darasal vah kabhi bhartiya film abhinetri hua karti thi jinhone chachaa choudhary se vivaah karne tab nishchay kiya jab chachaa ne unki jaan kuch badmaashon se bachaai jinhone unke jevar luutane ke liye jaan kii dhamkee di thi
 Many characters are unaware of the mystery that uncle Chaudhary has a twin brother, Chhajju Chaudhary, but he is not as virtuous as an uncle
 kai kahaniyon main ve use gupt hathiyaar kii tarah beyimaan evam badmaashon ke viruddh unako bhramit karte
 Once upon a time, the Mangalwasis took him into misunderstanding as being uncle Chaudhary
 raaket unka paaltu kutta he
 Whom he found to be like stray dogs and the uncle gave him shelter, though his wife was very angry with him, who then found it appropriate to eat a handful after feeding Sabu
 magar baad main ghar main ghuse ek chor par hamalaa karne kii ghatana baad vah use apana leti he
 In this way it is named "rocket"
 kacomics raaket kute ke visheshta par itnaa hi kaha jaataa he ki "chachaa choudhary kaa kutta slorp slorp dudh peetaa he" athwa aisa kaha jaataa ki puure vishwa vahi aisa kutta he joki shaakaahaari he
 Rocket has proved himself on several occasions when he is asked to pounce on his enemy
 ek nate kad kaa anaath or berozegaar yuvak, jo chachaa ko apana guru maan letaa hai
 Like Sabu, his height is not right, but with the same tricks and teachings of uncle, it would have made many difficulties easier
 magar africa desh ke congou kii yatra dauraan yahi nataapan uske liye musiibat ban jaati he, jise chachaa tathaa sabu badi mushkil se use bachaa pate hai

 'thakur' naam ke hindi main teen prasiddh kavi hue hai - asanivaale pracheen thakur, asanivaale duusare thakur or tisare thakur bundelkhandi
 Being three in number, they are also called 'thakurtrayi'
 inamen pehle do thakur asani ke rahane vaale brahmabhatt the
 The time of ancient Thakur is believed to be around 1700
 inaki svachh or chalati bhashaa main likhi footkal kavitaayen hi 'kalidas hajaaraa' aadi kavyasangrahon main yatra-tatra bikhri pai jaati hai
 By the way, the compositions of the three Thakurs have got so mixed that it is quite difficult to differentiate them easily
 asanivaale duusare thakur rishinath kavi ke putr the or inke pautra kavi sevak ke bhattije shrikrishna ke anusaar inke purvaj kavi devakinandan mishra gorakhpurvasi saraupari brahman payaasi mishra the, jinhen majhauli ke raja ke yahan vivaah main bhaaton kii tarah ek kavitt padhane ke naate jatiut hona padaa
 Later, he married the daughter of the famous Bhat poet Narhari of Asni and became a Bhat and settled there too

 Thakur was born in 1792, according to Ramnaresh Tripathi
 kaashi ke nami rais or kashiraj ke sambandhi babu devakinandan thakur kavi ke ashrayadata the jinke prityrth kavi ne 'bihari satsai' ko 'devakinandan tikaa', 'satsai bernarth' banaai
 His poetry has expressions and linguistic elegance, wonders and plausibility
 sukumaar bhavvyanjana, vimuguakari uktichamatkaar or nirbaadh drishyanirvaah, duusare thakur kii kavita ke pramukh gun hai
 The third Bundelkhandi Thakur was a distinguished and loving poet of the ritualistic ritual, who is believed to have been born in Orchhe around 1823 and Dehavasan 1880
 inkaa puraa naam tha thakurdaas
 This was Srivastava Kayastha
 thakur jaitpur ke nivasee or vahiin ke sthaneey raja kesarisingh ke darbari kavi the
 Father Gulabrai was the Musahab of Maharaja Orchha and the grandfather of Khangarai Kakori
 dariyaav singh 'chaatur' thakur ke putr or pautra shankaraprasad bhi sukavi the
 Thakur entered almost all the courts of Bundelkhand
 bijawar naresh ne unhen ek gaanv dekar sammanit kiya tha
 While throne, King Kesari Singh's son Parichat made Thakur a gem of his assembly
 baandaa ke himmatbahadur gosai ke yahan bhi, jo padmakar ke pramukh ashrayadaataaon main the, thakur kaa baraabar aana janaa tha
 Since Thakur was a contemporary of Padmakar, the two would meet when they were there, which resulted in the occasional poetic competition-driven thumping and banging which many popular folk legends of this kind address
 prakruti se thakur svachhand, manamaujee, nirbhik, spashtvaadi, swabhimani, saundaryapremi, bhavuk, 'virodhiyon ke prati ugr evam sahyogiyon ke prati sahruday', udaar or buddhi ke doordarshee, kushal, marm tak pahunchnewale tathaa deshkal kii gati ko acchhee tarah pahchaananevaale vyakti the
 Despite being a courtier, he never exaggerated the praise of any refugee
 'sevak sipaahi' shabdon se aarambh honevaala kavitt kavi kii ant:prakruti kii acchhee jhaanki prastut karata he jise thakur ne himmatbahadur kii katookti kaa uttar dene ke liye bhari sabha main talwaar khinchakar padhaa tha
 Due to the convincing of surreal, true and exuberant emotion in poetry, Thakur was as much irritated by the ritualistic tradition of poetic creation as the Tulsidas from the Gorakhists and Kabirists
 'logan kavitt kiwo khel kari jaano he' se ant honevaala kavitt ukt kathan kaa pratyaksh pramaan or kavi kii khiz, fatkaar tathaa us kaal kii rityashrayi hrasonmukhi kavita par karaare vyangy kaa suchak he
 For a long time, Thakur's compositions continued to appear in many ancient poetry collections in the form of sputum, but much later two collections named 'thakur Shatak' and 'thakur Thasak' were prepared
 'thakur shatak' ke, jisamen teenon thakuron kii kavitaayen, sangrahakarta the dumraanv nivasee nakchhedi tiwari 'ajaan' kavi or jiskaa prakaashan kaashi ke 'bharat jivan press' se uske adhyaksh babu ramakrishna verma 'vir' ke nirdesan main san 1904 i0 main hua tha
 After that, in 1926, Lala Bhagwadin brought out a collection 'thakur Thasak' from the 'sahitya Sevak' office of Kashi in 1926, which had only the footsteps of the third Thakur, but even after making a lot of efforts, he could not fully and clearly differentiate among the Thakurs' works
 
 lala ji ne 'thakur thasak' main 104 chand to 'thakur shatak' se hi liye, shesh 88 chand nae dhunde
 Thakur was a poet of natural and natural feeling
 unki kavitaaon main sarvatra yah saral or nishchal bhavanubhuti tarangit milti he
 He was an advocate of freedom in the field even while fully accepting the urge for art
 kavi ke paas jivan ke saras or anuthe bhaavon ke saath anuthi bhashaa bhi thi
 Though the subject of the poetry of Thakur is also akin to the ritualistic poets, adornment, devotion and policy, the type of experiment is quite different from that
 'prem ke panth' ko apanaakar bhi kavi nayikabhed ke chakkar main nahin padaa
 He has used the moving language of normal behavior
 akrutrim bhashastyli, sukumaar bhavabhivyakti ke liye paryaapt sakasham he
 No other person has used the phrase, idiom and popular words like the rational and accurate use of this poet
 isse abhivyakti swaabhaavik, manohar, sajiv or vyanjanapurna ho uthi he
 There was a smooth movement of the poet in Savaiya verses which had a clear impact on Bharatendu
 inhen visheshtaon ke kaaran anek samikshakon ne kavi ke kavy kii bhuri-bhuri prashansa karte hue likhaa he - 'premavishyak aise sachche or taksaali chand praaia: kisi bhi kavi kii rachana main nahin paae jate
 This great poet has depicted the human nature and the heartfelt expressions and waves of Chitsagar very successfully '
 'bhashaa, bhav-vyanjana, pravaah, maadhuri kisi bhi vichaar se thakur kaa koi bhi kavitt yaa savaiya uthaaie, padhate hi hriday naach uthegaa

 pradarshan kii avadhi ko adhik se adhik pratirodh ke vikaas ke liye antibiotic dawaaon kii jarurat kii gambhirtha par dhyaan die bina adhik se adhik jokhim nahin lenaa chahie
 The widespread use of antibiotics both inside and outside the drug is playing an important role in the resistant role of bacterial emergence
 Antibiotics are often used to manufacture resistant strains of bacteria used in food and animal rearing to use this among others
 kuch deshon main antibiotic dawaaon counter par ek parche jo pratirodhi upabhedon kaa nirmaan karne ke liye suraag ke bina bech rahe hai
 The problem of the emergence of well-regulated human-resistant bacteria in medicine is due to the misuse of antibiotics by leading doctors as well as the overuse of patients
 anya pratirodh kii disha main yogadan prathaon pashuon ke alaava fid karne ke liye antibiotic dawa shaamil hai anya utpaadon or sabun main gharelu upyog ke antibakterials prabhavi kiya ja rahaa, haalanki sankraman niyantran main he prabhavi kiya ja rahaa bhi nahin ke rup main 
 spasht rup se yogadan pratirodh nahin he
 On the other hand, the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry can also create the possibility of contributing antibiotic resistant strains to unhealthy practices

 The World Health Organization has concluded that antibiotics, as growth promoters in animals, should be prohibited in the absence of risk assessment
 In 1998, EU health ministers voted broadly in favor of promoting the use of animal development antibiotics despite the recommendations of their four scientific commissions
