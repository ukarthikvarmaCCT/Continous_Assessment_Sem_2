 mulugundan main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke karnulu jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Anarchy is an ideal whose principle is anarchism
 araajaktaavaad rajya ko samaapt kar vyaktiyon, samoohon or rashtron ke bich swatantra or sahaj sahyog dwaara samast maanviya sambandhon main nyaay sthapit karne ke prayatnon kaa siddhant he
 According to anarchism, freedom is the dynamic rule of life and hence it is intended that social organization should provide maximum opportunities for the freedom of work of individuals
 maanviya prakruti main aatmaniyaman kii aisi shakti he jo bahya niyantran se mukt rahane par sahaj hi suvyavastha sthapit kar sakati he
 The imposition of discipline on man is the father of social and moral evils
 isliye hinsa par ashrith rajya tathaa uski anya sansthaayen in buraaiyon ko dur nahin kar saktin
 Man is naturally good, but these institutions corrupt the human being
 bahya niyantran se mukt, vaastavik swatantraaa kaa sahyogi samuhik jivan pramukh reeti se chote samoohon se sambhav he; isliye saamaajik sanghathan kaa adarsh sanghavaadi he
 The credit for the first formulation of the theory of anarchism in a systematic way is attributed to Zeno, the originator of the Stoic ideology
 usne rajyarahit aise samaaj kii sthapana par jor diya jahaan nirpeksh samanta evam swatantraaa maanviya prakruti kii satpravritiyon ko suviksit kar saarvbhaum saamanjasy sathapit kar sake
 In the middle of the second century, the philanthropist of the communist form of anarchism, Carpocrates, spoke of the abolition of private property in addition to the state
 madhyayug ke uttarardh main isai darshanikon tathaa samudaayon ke vichaaron or sanghathan main kuch spasht araajaktaavaadi pravritiyaan vyakt huin jinka mukhya aadhaar yah daawa tha ki vyakti ishwar se sidhaa rahasyatmak sambandh sthapit kar papamukt ho saktaa he
 In the modern sense, anarchist theory was systematically presented by William Godwin, according to which government and private property are the two evils which hamper the attainment of natural perfection of mankind
 dusron ko adhinsth karne kaa saadhan hone ke kaaran sarkaar nirankushta kaa swaroop he or shoshan kaa saadhan hone ke kaaran nijee sampatti krur anyaay
 But Godwin described not all property as bad, but only property that helps exploitation
 adarsh saamaajik sanghathan kii sthapana ke liye usne hinsaatmak krantikari sadhano ko anuchit tehraaya
 Only by propagating the ideal of justice can one bring that consciousness to the person so that he can cooperate in establishing the ideal anarchist contractual system of small local units
 iske baad do vichaardhaaraon ne vishesh rup se araajaktaavaadi siddhant ke vikaas main yoga diya
 One was the ideology of extreme individualism, represented by Herbert Spencer
 in vichaarkon ke anusaar swatantraaa or satta main virodh he or rajya ashubh hi nahin, anaavashyak bhi he
 But these thinkers were certainly not in favor of abolition of private property nor against organized religion
 duusari vichaardhaara fuarabaakh ke darshan se sambandhit thi jisane sangathit dharm tathaa rajya ke parbhautik aadhaar kaa virodh kiya
 In line with Fuerbach's revolutionary ideas, Max Sterner called society only a girl and firmly stated that man's own personality is a reality that can be known
 vaiyaktikta par seemayen nirdhaarit karanevaale sabhi niyam ahan ke swasth vikaas main baadhak hai
 If there is a "union of egoists" in place of the state, then economic exploitation will be eradicated in the ideal system, because the main output of society will be the result of independent cooperation
 kranti ke sambandh main uskaa yah mat tha ki hinsa par ashrith rajya kaa unmoolan hinsa dwaara hi ho saktaa he
 Prudh is responsible for making anarchism a conscious mass movement
 usne sampatti ke ekadhikaar tathaa uske anuchit swaamitv kaa virodh kiya
 The ideal social organization is one that provides "freedom in the system and freedom in unity"
 is lakshya kii prapti ke liye do moulik krantiyaan aavashyak hai : ek kaa sanchaalan vartmaan aarthik vyavastha ke viruddh tathaa duusare kaa vartmaan rajya ke viruddh ho
 But in any case, revolution should not be violent, but emphasis should be on the economic freedom and moral development of the person
 antat: prudhon ne sweekaar kiya ki rajya ko purnroopen samaapt nahin kiya ja saktaa, isliye araajaktaavaad kaa mukhya uddeshy rajya ke kaaryon ko vikendrit karnaa tathaa swatantra samuhik jivan dwaara use jahaan tak sambhav ho, kam karnaa chahie
 Bakunin not only added some new trends to modern anarchism, but also gave it a collectivist form
 usne bhoomi tathaa utpaadan ke anya sadhano ke samuhik swaamitv par jor dene ke saath-saath upbhog kii vastuon ke nijee swaamitv ko bhi sweekaar kiya
 His idea has three foundations: anarchism, atheism and the principle of voluntary cooperation among the independent classes
 falat: vah rajya, carch or nijee sampatti, in teenon sansthaaon kaa virdohi he
 According to him, the present society is divided into two classes: the affluent class which holds the state power, and the elite class who are deprived of land, capital and education, are subject to the autocracy of the first class, so are also deprived of freedom

 In connection with the revolution, Bakounin expressed his confidence in violent means
 kranti kaa pramukh uddeshy in teenon sansthaaon kaa vinaash bataaya gaya he, parantu nae samaaj kii rachana ke vishay main kuch nahin kaha gaya
 Because of the immense belief in the tendency of cooperation of man, Bakunin had the idea that human society would free itself from the superstition of God, corruption of the state and exploitation of private property, to make its own healthy organization
 kranti ke sambandh main uskaa vichaar tha ki use jansadharan kii sahaj kriyaaon kaa pratifal hona chahie
 At the same time, he added terrorist theory to anarchism by placing excessive emphasis on violence

 Instead of the institution relying on violence, the ideal society would be the basis of voluntary associations and communities and their organization would develop from below

 Destroyer or Destroyer - Destroyer ships in maritime / naval language are called fast moving ships
 inkaa avishkaar 20veen sadi ke praarambhik varshon main hua or tabhi se nausenayuddh main isak sthaan bejod rahaa he
 It has a unique place in the history of the Navy due to the successful carrying out of multifaceted and reliable tasks
 at: iskaa ateet, vartmaan or bhavishya adhyayan karne yogya he
 It is certain that the destroyer was invented by torpedoes
 tarpedo ne nausenayuddh main kranti laa di
 This was the first time a small ship equipped with a torpedo could take a front from a large navy and destroy it
 nausainik samartantr main is krantikari avishkaar se chote jahaajon kaa vikaas aavashyak ho gaya
 There were two reasons for this : in kaarnon se hi vinaashak kaa avishkaar hua
 In the early ruptures, called "torpedo nostrils", there were only two torpedo tubes
 shatru ke dhwanskon par akraman karne ke liye inpar aage kii ore ek top arudh hoti thi
 These ships were very small, with displacement of 200 to 300 tons
 samay bitne par dhwansak kaa prabhaav badhaane ke liye usapar adhikadhik tarpedo ladanaa aavashyak samajha gaya
 The number of torpedo tubes gradually increased, and by the time of World War II, eight nozzles on two mountings were humanized
 akramak asron main hawaii jahaaj kaa pravesh hote hi dekha gaya ki hawaii akramanon se bachaav ke liye dhwansak par havamar top kaa rahanaa aavashyak he
 Initially, the general machine gun was installed on the destroyer, but such small guns did not have destructiveness, so later amphibious guns were installed
 pandubbi kaa vikaas hone par vinaashak par ek kaam or aa padaa
 That was, finding and destroying submarines
 iske parinamswaroop dhwansak pandubbimaar astr bhi dhone lage
 This was bound to increase the size and extent of the destroyer
 pratham vishwayuddh ke purv jahaan vinaashak keval 300 din ton visthaapan ke hote the vahaan aaj 2,000 ton se adhik visthaapan ke vinaashak banane lage hai
 There have been many radical improvements in destroyers over the last few decades, but its basic features, such as high speed and maneuvers, have not differed
 tej gati ke abhaav main bade bade jahaajon par akraman karte samay vinaashkon ke batch nikalne kii sambhaavna kam rah jaati he
 Their amazing ability to be protected at sea is due to their streamlined shape and design
 dhwansak main jo astr-shastr rahete hai ve teen shreniyon main vibhakt kiye ja sakate hai : 1
 torpedoes to attack ships, 2
 pandubbi par akraman ke liye asr shasr, 3
 Amphibious cannons for fighting aircraft and small ground forces
 yon to vinaashak kaa nirmaan hi bade jahaajon par tarpedo se akraman karne ke liye hota he, tathaapi aadhunik nausenayuddh main tarpedo akraman ke avasar kam hone ke kaaran tarpedo kaa mahatv dhire-dhire ghat rahaa he
 But it cannot be said that the days of the torpedo attack are now over
 peechha karanevaale or lautanevaale tarpedo ke aagaman se jahaajwahit tarpedo ke din phir laut sakate hai
 According to some people, the submarine has developed so much that it cannot be destroyed by the destroyer
 yadhyapi kuch seemaa tak yah kathan satya he phir bhi nikat pareekshan se prakat hota he ki aaj bhi vinaashak pandubbi ko maarane main samarth he
 In the last World War, 300 submarines were submerged by the destroyers
 ab to sudurastha lakshvedhi astron or sudhari hui swananvesh yuktiyaan uplabdh hai, jinase vinaashkon kii shakyata bahut bad gai he
 Submarines torpedoes containing drone helicopters and rockets have greatly increased the ability to search and destroy submarines
 samudri jahaajon ke liye hawaii akramanon kaa sankat bad jane se uske nirakaranarth hawamaron kii shakyata badhanaa swabhaavik tha
 But even radar controlled and instant hit cannons cannot protect against aerial accidental aircraft
 top ke sthaan par niyantrit missile kaa prayog hone par, jaisaa ant main hoga, dhwansak pehle ke samaan hi prabal ho jaayenge
 The destroyers are the most trusted parts of the fleet
 pichley mahayuddh main dhwanskon ne sab prakaar kaa kaary kiya tha
 They hid the task forces, escorted the convoys, transported the initial survey teams, hid the waterfront ghats, rescued casualties in the war and dispensed postage
 saath hi lagbhag 300 pandubbiyon ko bhi dubaaya
 They ranged from warships located at the very bottom of the water to cruisers, destroyers and petrol vessels
 dhwanskon kaa bhavishya ujjwal maaloom hota he
 In future these carriers will be an essential part of Kritik Sen
 ye krithik sena ke parichayan paraas ko paryaapt badhaakar tathaa vaahak hawaii gashat kaa niyantran karke hawaii pratiraksha ko sudrudh karege
 Only the submarine can destroy the fast ships
 uttam pandubbimaar asron se las dhwansak khojane maarane kii karrwai main bejod honge
 The destroyer has proved to be a very useful ship even today in the maintenance work
 bhavi dhwansak kaise honge, isaki pariklpana hi kii ja sakati he, par aadhunik jhukaav ko dhyaan main rakhte hue yah pariklpana bahut kuch yatharth hogi
 The future destructor will almost certainly operate with nuclear power, since nuclear power will be the only means by which the tolerance of the destructor can be increased
 bhavishya main dhwansak kii sahansheeltaa mahatv kaa kaary karegi, isamen koi andeh nahin, kyonki krithik sena ko hafton tak samudr main rahanaa pad saktaa he
 It will also be necessary to increase the speed of the destroyer
 bhavi dhwansak saralata se 50 note kii chaal se chal sakegaa
 It will be necessary to reduce the torpedo weapons
 par dhwansak main pandubbimaar tarpedo rah sakate hai
 They would have rockets, the active tips returning to the torpedoes, such that they could be filled with tubes by the string
 topon ko purnataya hataa dena padegaa or unke sthaan par tal-se-tal vaale niyantrit missile lage rahenge
 There will also be drone helicopters on the destroyers
 saranshat: naveenatam kism ke pandubbimaar astron, aadhuniktam kism kii khoj karanevaali yuktiyon or niyantrit missile kii badariyon se yukt dhwanskon kaa kaary bhavi yuddh main bahut hi mahatvapurn hoga

 inkaa istemaal pratiyogitaaon or lokapriy khel manoranjan ke liye kiya jaataa he or kuch maamalon main inhen motocross res, keechad fansaav, tractor khinch or car-eating robot ke saath prastut kiya jaataa he
 Monster truck shows are sometimes displayed crushing small vehicles under the huge tire of the truck

 In some events, only one truck is on the path, while two drivers are shown racing alongside each other on mostly symmetrical tracks, with the losing driver being eliminated in single-elimination tournament fashion
 haal ke varshon main, kai monstor trek pratiyogitaaon kii samaapti "free style" se hui
 To some extent, drivers of giant trucks, akin to figure skating, are free to choose their route around the track and between its obstacles
 drivers aksar "donuts", wheelstand ko aajamaate hai or is khand ke dauraan chalaang lagaate hai

 kai trek maalikon ne aisi pratiyogitaaon main pratispardhaa ke liye lifted trek banaae or jald hi "sabase vishaal trek" kaa khitaab paane kii pratiyogita viksit ho gai
 The trucks that gained the most attention at the national level were Bob Chandler's Bigfoot, Everett Jessmer's USA-1, Fred Sheaffer and Jack Willman Senier's Bearfoot and Jeff Dane's King Kong
 The largest tire used at that time in trucks was 48 inches in diameter
 april 1981 main, bob chandalar ne ek maidan main kaaron ke upar se gaadi chalaai jise mana jaataa he ki kaaron ko kuchalane vaala vah pehla monstor trek tha
 Chandler drove him over a pair of cars to test the truck's ability and filmed it for use as a promotional tool in his four-wheel drive demonstration shop
 An event organizer saw the video of the car being crushed and asked Chandler to do the same in front of the audience
 Chandler eventually succumbs to this scene, fearing that Bigfoot would become a "destructive" image
 kuch chote samaaroh ke baad, chandalar ne is kartab ko 1982 main pontiek silverdom main pradarshit kiya
 At the show, Chandler debuted with a new version of Bigfoot with 66-inch diameter tires
 80 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main jab bigafoot 48 inch terra tair par chal rahaa tha, to kaha jaataa he ki trek-a-rama naam kii motorsport promoshan company ke maalik bob jorge ne bigafoot kii charchaa karte samay "monstor trek" naam kaa izaad kiya
 The term "monster truck" has since become the generic name for all trucks with giant terra tires
 pehali baar car ko kuchalane kaa kaam kisne kiya yah aksar bahes kaa mudda rahaa he
 In the late 1970s, it is claimed that Jeff Den's King Kong axed the car on the Great Lakes Dragway in Union Grove, Wisconsin

 It was this video that inspired the organizers and they asked Chandler to perform a demonstration of crushing the car in front of the audience
 king kong or bear foot ne bigafoot ke 66 inch vyas tair kaa anugaman kiya or jald hi anya monstor trek jaise ki king crunch, madog or varjeenia jayant kaa nirmaan kiya gaya

 However, since Monster Truck events have a more extensive exhibition environment than most motorcycles, these competitions are often considered a form of "sports entertainment"
 monstor trek kaaryakramon kaa vigyaapan bhi lokapriy samskruti kaa ek hissaa ban gaya he
 a familiar 1980s radio ad for various monster trucks featured a screaming announcer, which featured high-pitched rock background music and a full use of echo

 Seeing the condition of his former bandmate, Waters was reportedly overjoyed and asked Barrett a fellow visitor, Andrew King, how he became so gross
 Barrett said that there was a big refrigerator in his kitchen and he ate a lot of pork chops
 He also said that he is ready to give his services to the band, but hearing the mix of 'shine On', he gave no indication of understanding its relevance to their plight
 At Gilmour's wedding at the EMI canteen, he joined the guests, but later left without saying goodbye

 Waters used the spitting incident as the basis for a new concept that was based around the audience's separation from the performers on stage

 Both albums did not sell much, a situation that was exacerbated by the loss of the band's accumulated wealth

 NWG ne, na keval asafal kaarobaar main nivesh kiya, unhone band ko unki aay ke kareeb 83% kar bill ke liye uttaradaayi chhod diya
 He consequently ended his relationship with NWG and demanded a return of cash that had not yet been invested, which at the time reached £ 860,000
 isi bich, july 1977 main, waters ne band ke samaksh do nae vichaaron ko prastut kiya

 The story was based on Pink's central character - a character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences - most notably his father's death in World War II
 is pehle 'bricks in da wal' ne or adhik samasyaon ko prerit kiya, jisamen se prayek pink ko or pruthak karne main lage the
 Later Pink was so drug-distraught and so let down by the music industry that it culminated in an epiphany, a development partly inspired by Sid Barrett's decadence

 In Britannia Row, Brian Humphries became emotionally hollow during his five years with the band and was replaced by James Guthrie

 The work continued until March 1979, at which time the band's fragile financial situation demanded that they leave Britain for a year or more and continue recording at Super Bear Studios near Nice

 His relationship with Ezrin had soured, but his relationship with Wright was completely broken

 i was missing my children terribly
 What happened right after that remains unclear
 insaide out main mesun kehete hai ki waters ne o'rurake ko bulaayaa, jo QE2 par america ja rahe the or unhen kaha ki album ke mishran ke liye waters ke LA pahunchane se pehle rhit ko band se baahar kar den
 Nonetheless, in Comfortably Nam, the author states that, Waters called o'rourke and asked him to tell Wright about the new recording arrangement, and apparently Wright's response was "tell Roger to go to hell
" 

 "
 Wright does not agree with this memory and points out that the band agreed to record only during the spring and early summer and have no idea that they were lagging behind schedule
 waters dang the or unhone mahasoos kiya ki album ko purna karne main rhite paryaapt prayaas nahin kar rahe hai
 Gilmour was on leave in Dublin when he came to know of Waters' ultimatum and tried to calm the situation

 Alan Parker agreed to direct and took a different approach

 For some of the film's songs, a revised soundtrack was also produced

 The soundtrack for The Wall was intended to be Spare Brix as the album, but with the introduction of the Falklands Conflict, Waters began writing new material for the album that featured Pink Floyd's last, presenting Waters and Gilmour together Album made

 Immediately there was a debate between Waters and Gilmour who felt that the album should include new material, rather than songs not considered better for The Wall
 Waters however was skeptical, as Gilmour had not contributed much to the band's songs over the years
 maaikel kamen ne donon ke bich madhyasthata kii or us bhoomika ko nibhaayaa jis par paaramparik rup se richard rhite ne kabja kiya hua tha jo ab anupasthit the

 After the final confrontation, Gilmour's name as producer was removed from the gratitude list, indicating Waters' low contribution to songwriting by him

 Different types of kidney cancer develop in different ways, which means that diseases have different long-term consequences, and should be phased out and treated in different ways
 aaarasisi mukhya rup se lagbhag 80% praathmik gurde ke cancer ke liye jimmedaar he, or usisi khaaton main shesh shesh hai
 The overall five-year survival rate in the United States is 73%
 gurde tak hi simit cancer ke liye, paanch saal kii jivit rahane kii dar 92% he, yadi yah aasapaas ke lymph nodes main fail gai he, to yah 65% he, or yadi yah metastasis he, to yah 12% he
 In addition to kidney cell carcinoma and renal percutaneous carcinoma, other common types of kidney cancer include: squamus cell carcinomajuttaglomeryar cell tumor angeomiolipomabelini nalika carcinomagurde kii saaf-koshika sercomamesoblastic nefromavilms tumor, aam taur par 5 varsh se kam umr ke bacchon main bataaya jaataa hamishrit upakalaa stromel tumor Unfortunately, some other types of cancer and possibly cancerous tumors that are most common can arise from the kidneys

 gurde ke cancer ke sabase aam lakshan or lakshan mutr main pet or / yaa rakt main dravyaman hai
 Other symptoms may include tiredness, loss of appetite, weight loss, a high temperature and heavy sweating, and persistent abdominal pain

 Treatment for kidney cancer depends on the type and stage of the disease
 surgery sabase aam upachaar he kyonki gurde ke cancer se aksar chemotherapy or radiotherapy kaa jawaab nahin hota he
 Surgical complication can be estimated by renal nephrometry scoring system
 yadi cancer failata nahin he, to yah aam taur par surgery dwaara hataa diya jayega
 In some cases it is associated with the removal of the entire kidney, although most tumors are responsible for partial removal to terminate the tumor and preserve the remaining normal portion of the kidney
 surgery hameshaa sambhav nahin he - udhaaharan ke liye rogi ko anya chikitsa sharton se rokna pad saktaa he, yaa cancer sharir ke chaaron ore fail saktaa he or doctor ise hataane main sakasham nahin ho sakate hai
 There is currently no evidence that body-wide medical treatment after surgery where there is no known residual disease is an adjuvant, helping to improve survival in kidney cancer
 yadi cancer kaa ilaaj surgery ke saath nahin kiya ja saktaa he, jaise ki tumor thanda karnaa yaa ise ucch taapmaana ke saath ilaaj karnaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 However, they are not yet used as standard treatment for kidney cancer

 Most kidney cancers found in children are of Wilms' tumor type
 These tumors can begin to grow when a fetus is still developing in the uterus, and cannot cause problems until the child is a few years old

 chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kaa vivaah san 14 may 1640 main saibai nimbalkar ke saath laal mahal, puna main hua tha
 At that time the kingdom of Bijapur was going through a period of mutual struggle and foreign invasion
 aise samrajya ke sultan kii seva karne ke badale unhone maawalon ko bijapur ke kilaaf sangathit karne lage
 Maval Pradesh is connected to the Western Ghats and is some 150 km long and 30 km wide

 Marathas and people of all castes live in this region
 shivaji maharaj in sabhi jati ke logon ko lekar maawalon naam dekar sabhi ko sangathit kiya or unase sampark kar unke pradesh se parichit ho gaye the
 He had started the construction of the fort by bringing Maval youths
 maawalon kaa sahyog shivaji maharaj ke liye baad main utana hi mahatvapurn sabit hua jitna shershah suri ke liye afagaanon kaa saath
 At that time Bijapur was troubled by mutual struggle and Mughal invasion
 bijapur ke sultan adilshaah ne bahut se durgon se apni sena hataakar unhen sthaneey shaskaon yaa samanton ke haath saunp diya tha
 When Adilshah fell ill, anarchy spread in Bijapur and Shivaji Maharaj took advantage of the opportunity and decided to enter Bijapur
 shivaji maharaj ne iske baad ke dinon main bijapur ke durgon par adhikaar karne kii niti apanaai
 The first fort was the fort of Toran
 torana kaa durg puna ke dakshin pashchim main 30 kilometre kii duuri par tha
 Shivaji sent his envoy to Sultan Adilshah and informed him that he was ready to pay better money than the first fortress and handed over this area to him
 unhone adilshaah ke darbariyon ko pehle hi rishwat dekar apane paksh main kar liya tha or apane darbariyon kii salaah ke mutabik adilshaah ne shivaji maharaj ko us durg kaa adhipati bana diya
 Shivaji Maharaj got the work done to repair the deficiencies of the fort with the property found in that fort
 isse koi 10 kilometre dur rajgad kaa durg tha or shivaji maharaj ne is durg par bhi adhikaar kar liya
 When Adilshah got the idea of shivaji Maharaj's policy of expanding this empire, he was upset
 usne shahji raaje ko apane putr ko niyantran main rakhane ko kaha
 Shivaji Maharaj, regardless of his father, took over the management of his father's territory in his hands and stopped regular renting
 rajgad ke baad unhone chaakan ke durg par adhikaar kar liya or uske baad kondana ke durg par
 While taking possession of Kondana, he had to bribe
 usake baad aurangzeb ne mirzaraja jaisingh ko bhejkar 23 kilon par kabja kiya baad main shiji maharaj ke mawala tanaji malusre ne kondhana durg par kabja kiya par us yuddh main vah viragati ko praapt hua uski yaad main kondana par adhikaar karne ke baad uskaa naam singhgarh rakhaa gaya
 Shahaji Raje was given the title of Poona and Soupa and the fortress of Soupa was in the hands of his relative Baji Mohite
 shivaji maharaj ne raat ke samay soopa ke durg par akraman karke durg par adhikaar kar liya or baaji mohite ko shahji raaje ke paas karnataka bhej diya
 Some part of his army also came in the service of Shivaji Maharaj
 isi samay purandar ke kiledaar kii mrityu ho gai or kile ke uttaradhikaar ke liye uske teenon beton main ladaai chhid gai
 Shivaji Maharaj reached Purandar on the invitation of two brothers and, taking recourse to diplomacy, he imprisoned all the brothers
 is tarah purandar ke kile par bhi unka adhikaar sthapit ho gaya
 In the event so far, Shivaji Maharaj did not have to do any war or bloodshed
 1647 isvi tak ve chaakan se lekar nira tak ke bhubhag ke bhi adhipati ban chuke the
 With his increased military power, Shivaji Maharaj planned to enter the plains
 ek ashwarohi sena kaa gathan kar shivaji maharaj ne aabaaji sonder ke netritv main konkan ke viruddh ek sena bheji
 Abaji captured nine other fortifications including Konkan
 iske alaava taala, mosmala or raiti ke durg bhi shivaji maharaj ke adheen aa gaye the
 All the property looted was kept safe in Raigad
 kalyaan ke governor ko mukt kar shivaji maharaj ne kolaba kii ore rukh kiya or yahan ke pramukhon ko videshiyon ke kilaaf yuddh ke liye uksaaya
 Sultan of Bijapur was already in a rage before Shivaji Maharaj's antics
 usne shivaji maharaj ke pita ko bandi banane kaa aadesh de diya
 Shahaji Raje was in Karnataka at the time and was taken prisoner by a treacherous assistant Baji Ghorpade and brought to Bijapur
 un par yah bhi aarope lagaaya gaya ki unhone qutubashah kii seva praapt karne kii koshish kii thi jo golconda kaa shaasha tha or is kaaran adilshaah kaa shatru
 After the mediation of two chieftains of Bijapur, Shahaji Maharaj was freed on the condition that he would control Shivaji Maharaj
 agle chaar varshon tak shivaji maharaj ne bijipur ke kilaaf koi akraman nahin kiya
 During this time he organized his army
 shahji kii mukti kii sharton ke mutabik shivaji rajane bijapur ke kshetron par akraman to nahin kiya par unhone dakshin-pashchim main apni shakti badhaane kii cheshtaa kii
 But in this order the state of Javali was acting as a hindrance
 yah rajya satara ke sudur uttar pashchim main vama or krishna nadi ke bich main sthit tha
 The king here was Chandrarao More, who received this manor from Shivaji
 shivaji ne more shaasha chandrarav ko swaraj main shamil hone ko kaha par chandrarav bijapur ke sultan ke saath mil gaya
 In 1656, Shivaji attacked Javali with his army
 chandrarav more or uske donon putron ne shivaji ke saath ladaai kii par ant main ve bandi bana liye gaye par chandrarav bhaag gaya
 The local people opposed this act of Shivaji but they succeeded in crushing the rebellion
 isse shivaji ko us durg main sangrahit aath vanshon kii sampatti mil gai
 Apart from this, many Maval soldiers Murarabaji Deshpande also joined Shivaji's army
 shivaji ke bijapur tathaa mughal donon shatru the
 At that time, Shahzada Aurangzeb was the Subedar of Deccan
 isi samay 1 navambar 1656 ko bijapur ke sultan adilshaah kii mrityu ho gai jiske baad bijapur main araajaktaa kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya
 Taking advantage of this situation, Aurangzeb invaded Bijapur and Shivaji attacked him instead of supporting Aurangzeb
 unki sena ne junnar nagar par akraman kar dher sari sampatti ke saath 200 ghode lut liye
 Apart from 700 horses, four elephants from Ahmednagar, they looted the fort of Gunda and Resin
 iske parinamswaroop aurangzeb shivaji se khafaa ho gaya or maitri vaarta samaapt ho gai
 On the orders of Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb made a treaty with Bijapur and at the same time Shah Jahan fell ill
 uske vyaadhigrast hote hi aurangzeb uttar bharat chalaa gaya or vahaan shahjahan ko kaid karne ke baad mughal samrajya kaa shah ban gaya
 Knowing the absence of Aurangzeb in South India and the political situation in Bijapur, Shivaji asked Samarji to attack Janjira
 par zanjeera ke siddiyon ke saath unki ladaai kai dinon tak chali
 After this Shivaji himself invaded Janjira and took control of South Konkan and collected annual tax from the Portuguese of Daman
 kalyaan tathaa bhiwandi par adhikaar karne ke baad vahaan nausainik adda bana liya
 By this time, Shivaji had become the owner of 40 fortifications

 Now Shivaji was the most powerful enemy of Bijapur
 shahji ko pehle hi apane putr ko niyantran main rakhane ko kaha gaya tha par shahji ne isamen apni asamarthta jaahir kii
 The Sultan of Bijapur sent Abdullah Bhatari against Shivaji to deal with Shivaji
 afajal ne 12 xxrep 4 0 sainikon ke saath 1659 main kooch kiya
 Destroying the temples of Tuljapur, he came to Shiraval, 30 km north of Satara
 par shivaji pratapgarh ke durg par hi rahe
 Afzal Khan sent his envoy Krishnaji Bhaskar for a treaty
 usne uske marfat ye sandesh bhijwaya ki agar shivaji bijapur kii adheenta sweekaar kar le to sultan use un sabhi kshetron kaa adhikaar de denge jo shivaji ke niyantran main hai
 At the same time, Shivaji will receive an honored position in the court of Bijapur
 haalanki shivaji ke mantri or salaahkaar as sandhi ke paksh main the par shivaji ko ye vaarta raas nahin ai
 He gave proper respect to Krishnaji Bhaskar and placed it in his court and sent his messenger Gopinath to Afzal Khan to take stock of the situation
 gopinath or krishnaji bhaskar se shivaji ko aisa laga ki sandhi kaa shadyantra rachakar afjal khan shivaji ko bandi bananaa chahta he
 Therefore, he sent a valuable gift to Afzal Khan in exchange for war and thus persuaded Afzal Khan to negotiate
 sandhi sthal par donon ne apane sainik ghaat lagaakar rakhe the milane ke sthaan par jab donon mili tab afjal khan ne apane katyar se shivaji pe waar kiya bachaav main shivaji ne afjal khan ko apane vastron vaghankho se maar diya 
 After the death of Afzal Khan, Shivaji took control of the fort of Panhala
 iske baad pavangadh or vasantgarh ke durgon par adhikaar karne ke saath hi saath unhone rustam khan ke akraman ko vifal bhi kiya
 With this they also captured Rajapur and Dawul
 ab bijapur main aatank kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya or vahaan ke samanton ne aapasi matbhed bhulaakar shivaji par akraman karne kaa nishchay kiya
 On 2 October 1665, the Bijapuri army captured the Panhala fort
 shivaji sankat main funs chuke the par raatri ke andhkaar kaa laabh uthaakar ve bhaagane main safal rahe
 The Sultan of Bijapur, taking command himself, withdrew his authority over Panhala, Pawangarh, looted Rajapur and killed the head of Shringargarh
 isi samay karnataka main siddijohar ke vidroh ke kaaran bijapur ke sultan ne shivaji ke saath samjhauta kar liya
 Shivaji's father Shahaji acted as a mediator in this treaty
 san 1662 main hui is sandhi ke anusaar shivaji ko bijapur ke sultan dwaara swatantra shaasha kii manyata mili
 According to this treaty, the area ranging from Kalyan in the north to Ponda in the south and from Indapur in the east to Davul in the west came under Shivaji's control
 shivaji kii sena main is samay tak 3 xxrep 4 0 paidal or 1000 ghudsavaar ho gaye the
 After the end of the race to become king in North India, Aurangzeb's attention shifted to the south
 wo shivaji kii badhati prabhutaa se parichit tha or usne shivaji par niyantran rakhane ke udyeshy se apane mamaa shysta khan ko dakshin kaa soobedaar niyukt kiya
 Shaiska Khan took 1,50,000 fos and took control of the fort of Supan and Chakan and reached Poona
 usne 3 saal tak mawal main lutmar ki
 One night Shivaji attacked him with his 350 Mavalos
 shysta to khidki ke raste batch nikalne main kaamyaab rahaa par use isi kram main apni chaar anguliyon se haath dhonaa padaa
 The sons of Shaista Khan, and forty guards and countless soldiers were slaughtered
 is ghatana ke baad aurangzeb ne shysta ko dakkan ke badale bengal kaa soobedaar bana diya or shahjada muajjam shysta kii jagah lene bheja gaya
 This victory increased Shivaji's reputation
 6 saal shaista khan ne apni 15 xxrep 4 0 fuj lekar raja shivaji kaa pura mulukh jalaakar tabah kar diya tha
 Therefore, Shivaji started looting in the Mughal territories to recover his damages
 surat us samay pashchimi vyapaariyon kaa garh tha or hindustani musalamaanon ke liye haj par jane kaa dwaar
 It was a prosperous city and its port was very important
 shivaji ne chaar hajaar kii sena ke saath 1664 main chah dinon tak surat ke dhanadya vyapaariyon ko lutaa
 They did not rob the common man and then returned
 is ghatana kaa zikr dach tathaa angrejon ne apane lekhon main kiya he
 By that time, European traders had settled in India and other Asian countries
 nadir shah ke bharat par akraman karne tak kisi bhi europea shakti ne bhartiya mughal samrajya par akraman karne kii nahin sochi thi
 Disgusted by the loot of Shivaji in Surat, Aurangzeb appointed Gaiyasuddin Khan as a faujdar of Surat in place of Inayat Khan
 or shahjada muajjam tathaa upasenapati raja jaswant singh kii jagah diler khan or raja jaisingh kii niyukti kii gai
 King Jai Singh attacked Shivaji with the support of Sultan of Bijapur, European powers and small feudatories
 is yuddh main shivaji ko haani hone lagi or haar kii sambhaavna ko dekhte hue shivaji ne sandhi kaa prastaav bheja
 According to this treaty in June 1665, Shivaji will give 23 fortifications to the Mughals and thus only 12 fort will be left with him
 in 23 durgon se hone vaali aamadani 4 lakh hun salanaa thi
 The areas of Balaghat and Konkan will be given to Shivaji, but he will have to pay 40 lakh Huns in 13 installments in return
 iske alaava prativarsh 5 lakh hun kaa rajasav bhi ve denge
 Shivaji himself will be free from being in Aurangzeb's court, but his son Shambhaji will have to fight in the Mughal court
 bijapur ke kilaaf shivaji mughalon kaa saath denge
 Shivaji was called to Agra where he felt that he was not getting proper respect
 iske kilaaf unhone apana rosh bhare darbar main dikhaaya or aurangzeb par vishwasghaat kaa aarope lagaaya
 Aurangzeb was angered by this and he saw Shivaji being detained and guarded by 5000 soldiers
 kuch hi dinon baad raja shivaji ko maar daalane kaa iraadaa aurangzeb kaa tha
 But both Shivaji and Sambhaji, with their courage and courage, managed to escape from it
 sambhaaji ko mathura main ek vishwasi brahman ke yahan chhod shivaji maharaj banaras, gayi, puri hote hue sakushal rajgad pahunch gaye 
 This gave the Marathas a new life
 aurangzeb ne jaisingh par shaq karke uski hatya vish dekar karvaa daali
 Shivaji signed a second treaty with the Mughals in 1668 after Jaswant Singh took the initiative
 aurangzeb ne shivaji ko raja kii manyata di
 Shivaji's son Shambhaji received a mansabdari of 5000 and Shivaji was returned to the districts of Poona, Chakan and Soupa

 Shivaji looted Surat city for the second time in 1670
 nagar se 132 lakh kii sampatti shivaji ke haath lagi or lautate vakt unhone mughal sena ko surat ke paas phir se haraaya
 By 1674, Shivaji had captured all the territories which had to be given to the Mughals under the Treaty of Purandar
 pashchimi maharashtra main swatantra hindu raashtra kii sthapana ke baad shivaji ne apana rajbhishek karnaa chaha, parantu muslim sainiko ne brahamanon ko dhamkee di ki jo bhi shivaji kaa rajbhishek karegaa unki hatya kar di jaayegi
 jab ye baat shivaji tak pahunchi kii mughal sardaar aise dhamkee de rahe he tab shivaji ne ise ek chunauti ke rup me liya or kaha kii ab wo us rajya ke brahamn se hi abhishek karavaayenge jo mughalon ke adhikaar main he
 shivaji ke nijee sachiv balaji ji ne kaashi main teen duto ko bheja, cunki kaashi mughal samrajya ke adheen tha
 jab duuton ne sandesh diya to kaashi ke brahamn kaaphi prasann huye
 kintu mughal sainiko ko yah baat pataa chal gai tab un brahmano ko pakad liya
 parantu yukti purvak un brahmanon ne mughal sannico ke samaksh un duuton se kaha ki shivaji koun he ham nahin jaanate he
 ve kis vansh se hai ? duuton ko pataa nahin tha isaliye unhone kaha hamen pataa nahin he
 tab mughal sainiko ke sardaar ke samaksh un brahmanon ne kaha ki hamen kahin anyatra janaa he, shivaji kis vansh se hai aapane nahin bataaya at: aise main ham unke rajbhishek kaisekar sakate hai
 ham to tirth yatra par ja rahe hai or kashika koi anya brahman bhi rajbhishek nahin karegaa jab tak raja kaa purna parichay na ho at: aap waapas ja sakate hai
 mughal sardaar ne khush hoke brahmano ko chod diya or duto ko pakad kar aurangzeb ke paas dilli bhejne kii sochi par wo bhi chup ke se nikal bhaage
 waapas laut kar unhone ye baat balaji aav tathaa shivaji ko bataai
 parantu aashcharya janak rup se do din baad vahi brahman apane shishyon ke saath raigarh pahuchen ore shivaji kaa rajbhishek kiya
 After this, the Mughals tried to divide and even after the coronation of Shivaji, threatened the Brahmins of Poona that they should not accept Shivaji as the king
 So that people do not even consider it !! But they did not work
 Shivaji established the Ashtapradhan Mandal
 Apart from the envoys, representatives of various states, foreign traders were also invited to this ceremony
 par unke rajbhishek ke 12 din baad hi unki mata kaa dehanth ho gaya tha is kaaran se 4 oktober 1674 ko duusari baar shivaji ne chhatrapati kii oopaadhi grahan kii
 The ceremony, which took place twice, cost about 50 lakh rupees
 is samaaroh main hindu swaraj kii sthapana kaa udghosh kiya gaya tha
 It was the first Hindu kingdom in the south after the fall of Vijayanagar
 ek swatantra shaasha kii tarah unhone apane naam kaa sikaa chalavaaya
 After this, the Sultan of Bijapur sent two of his commanders against Shivaji for the Konkan victory but they failed
 san 1677-78 main shivaji kaa dhyaan karnataka kii ore gaya
 On April 4, 1680, Shivaji passed away after commanding Konkan in south of Bombay, Belgaum and Dharwad region west of Tungabhadra river, Mysore, Valari, Trichur and Jinji
 teen saptaah kii beemaari ke baad shivaji kii mrityu 3 april 1680 main hui
 At that time, Sambhaji inherited Shivaji's succession

 falit jyotish us vidya ko kehete hai jisamen manushya tathaa prithvi par, grahon or taron ke shubh tathaa ashubh prabhaavon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The compound meaning of the word astrology is lore related to planets and constellations
 is shabd se yadhyapi ganit jyotish kaa bhi bodh hota he, tathaapi saadhaaran log jyotish vidya se falit vidya kaa arth hi lete hai
 The colors of planets and stars have different types of colors, so the rays emanating from them also have different effects
 inhen kirnon ke prabhaav kaa bharat, babilonia, khaldia, yunaan, misr tathaa china aadi deshon ke vidwaanon ne pracheen kaal se adhyayan karke grahon tathaa taron kaa swabhaav gyaat kiya
 Earth is a planet in the solar system
 atev isapar tathaa iske nivaasiyon par mukhyatya surya tathaa saura mandal ke grahon or chandramaa kaa hi vishesh prabhaav padataa he
 The Earth moves in a special orbit called a revolution
 prithvi falit jyotish us vidya ko kehete hai jisamen manushya tathaa prithvi par, grahon or taron ke shubh tathaa ashubh prabhaavon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The compound meaning of the word astrology is lore related to planets and constellations
 is shabd se yadhyapi ganit jyotish kaa nivaasiyon ko surya isi main chalata dikhalaai padataa he
 There are some constellations around this orbit, which are called zodiac signs
 inaki sankhya he
 Aries begins at the equator and equator of the ecliptic
 ayan kii gati ke kaaran yah bindu sthir nahin he
 In western astrology, considering the current property of equinoxes and revolutions as the starting point, 12 zeros of 30 degrees each are imagined
 bhartiya jyotish main suryasiddhant aadi granthon se aanevaale sampaat bindu hi mesh aadi kii gananaa kii jaati he
 In this way, there is a difference of about 23 degrees between the Western calculation system and the Indian calculation system
 bhartiya pranali nirayan pranali he
 The scholars of Falit believe that this does not make any difference in the result, because scholars of different countries have studied the effects of planets and stars with their own calculation system for this learning
 bharat main 12 raashiyon ke 27 vibhaag kiye gaye hai, jinhen nakshatra kehete hai
 These are Ashwini, Bharani etc
 fal ke vichaar ke liye chandramaa ke nakshatra kaa vishesh upyog kiya jaataa he
 Is derived from astrology or astrology, ie "study")
 It is the set of systems, practices and opinions through which the personality, matters related to man's life and other worldly subjects are understood and interpreted based on the comparative position of celestial bodies and other related details and organized information in this context
 Is done
 jyotish jaananevaale kojyotishi yaa ek bhavishyavaktaa kaha jaataa he
 'third millennium BC 
 From its earliest recorded writings to date, many practices and applications based on the principles of astrology have been executed
 samskruti, shuruuaati khagol vigyaan or anya vidyaon ko aakaar dene main isane mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai he
 Astrology and astronomy were often considered indistinguishable before the modern era
 bhavishya ke bare main jaananaa or divine gyaan kii prapti, khagoleey avlokan ke praathmik prerakon main se ek hai
 Since the end of the Renaissance to the end of the 18th century, astronomy began to slowly disintegrate
 faltah, khagol vigyaan ne khagoleey vastuon ke vaigyanik adhyayan or ek aise siddhant ke rup main apni ek pahchaan banaai jiskaa uski jyotishiya samaj se kuch lenaa dena nahin tha
 Astrologers believe that the movement and position of celestial bodies either directly affect the Earth or is somehow related to human scale or events experienced by humans
 aadhunik jyotishiyon dwaara jyotish ko ek pratikatmak bhashaa, ek kala ke rup main yaa bhavishyakathan, ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he, jabaki bahut se vaigyanikon ne ise ek chhadam vigyaan yaa andhvishwaas kaa naam diya he
 Despite the difference in definitions, a general notion of astrology is that celestial bodies can help in understanding the events of the past and the present and the prophecy from their hierarchy
 ek matdaan main, 31% amirikiyon ne jyotish par apana vishwaas prakat kiya or ek anya adhyayan ke anusaar, 39% ne use vaigyanik mana he
 On the basis of astrology, the Shubhashubh fruit is specifically told about the position of the Grahanakshatras
 iske liye hamen sutron se ganit dwaara grah tathaa taron kii sthiti gyaat kerani padati he, athwa panchangon, yaa navik panchagon, se use gyaat kiya jaataa he
 The position of planets and constellations is variable every moment, so the impact of planets and constellations also have different types of events on every moment
 vaastavik grahasthiti gyaat karne ke liye ganit jyotish hi hamaara sahaayak he
 This results in a scientific basis for astrology
 kundali vah chakra he, jiske dwaara kisi isht kaal main raashichakr kii sthiti kaa gyaan hota he
 The zodiac is associated with the revolution cycle, whose position is not the same in different countries due to the difference in latitudes
 atev raashichakr kii sthiti jaanane ke liye sthaneey samay tathaa apane sthaan main honevaale raashiyon ke udai kii sthiti kaa gyaan aavashyak he
 Our watches refer to the time of a certain post-sun sun
 isse saraniyon kii, jo panchagon main di rahati hai, sahaayta se hamen sthaneey spashtkaal gyaat karnaa hota he
 Local clarification is called ishtakal
 ishtkaal main jo raashi purv kshitij main hoti he use lagn kehete hai
 The lagna is known by the knowledge of the immediate clear sun and by the knowledge of the rise of local zodiac signs
 is prakaar raashichakr kii sthiti gyaat ho jaati he
 Lagna is also taken up in the Indian system
 paashchaatya pranali main lagn sayan liya jaataa he
 In addition, they also know the zodiacal meridians
 bhartiya pranali main lagn jis raashi main hota he use upar kii ore likhakar shesh raashiyon ko vamavart se likh dete hai
 The lagna is imagined as the first house and then the zodiac as the second house etc
 1 The number of expressions is known by the position in their horoscope
 raashiyon kaa ankon dwaara tathaa grahon ko unke aadyaksharon se vyakt kar dete hai
 The zodiac of this type is called horoscope
 bhartiya paddati main jo saat grah maane jate hai, ve hai surya, chandra, mangal aadi
 Apart from this, there are also two Tamo planets, which are called Rahu and Ketu
 rahu ko sadaa krantivrutt tathaa chandrakaksha ke arohpaat par tathaa ketu kaa avarohpaat par sthit maanate hai
 According to the sentiment, or with which the lord is situated, their fruit changes
 swabhaavat: tamograh hone ke kaaran inkaa fal ashubh hota he
 In Western system Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces have the following signs respectively
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 The following signs for the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Guru, Saturn, Varuni, Varuna, and Yama respectively: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 And are used for the sun and the moon
 bhaavon kii sthiti ankon se vyakt kii jaati he
 By writing a clear lagna as the prepoint, from there, we write expressions in three parts equal to the quadrant
 grah jin raashiyon main ho un raashiyon main likh dete hai
 This is how a horoscope is called, which in English is called a horoscope
 europe main, bhartiya saat grahon ke atirikt, vaaruni, varun tathaa yama ke prabhaav kaa bhi adhyayan karte hai
 One has to study the nature of zodiac signs to know the fruit
 kundali ke vibhinn bhaavon se hamaare jivan se sambandh rakhanevaali vibhinn baton kaa pataa chalata he, jaise pratham bhav se sharir sambandhi, duusare bhav se dhan sambandhi aadi
 The lord of whatever zodiac sign is the lord of that house
 ek grah rashichkr par vibhinn prakaar se kirane phenkata he
 Therefore, the sight of the planet in the horoscope is also considered more or less complete
 grah jis grah sthaan par atyadhik prabhaav rakhata he use ucch tathaa usase saatven bhav ko uskaa neech kehete hai
 The planets are sometimes not visible to us from the Sun; Then they are called established
 isi prakaar vibhinn sthitiyon main grahon ke prabhaav ke anusaar unhen bal, yuva tathaa vruddh kehete he
 Other planets of the planets are friends or enemies due to their similarity or opposition to nature
 atev falit ke liye grahon ke balaabal ko janaa jaataa he
 The planet which is young, situated in its place or high and has a Yut or vision from its friends, has a lot of influence
 isi prakaar vah bhav jo apane swami se yut athwa drusht ho or jisamen shubh grah hon, purna fal detaa he
 In this way, the strength of planets, their position and other planets are also considered
 iske saath paristhitiyon tathaa manushya kii dasha kaa bhi vichaar kiya jaataa he
 For all these reasons, it is very difficult to tell the result
 jo log ganit jyotish ke gyaan ke bina fal bataate hai, ve thik nahin bataa sakate
 Since most astrologers are found to be like this, some people are beginning to doubt the scientificness of this science
 hamaare jivan ke upar sabase adhik surya tathaa chandramaa kaa prabhaav padataa he, atev paashchaatya deshon main suryasthit raashi tathaa chandrasthit raashi ko vishesh mahatv dete hai
 The Sun is reflective of the stable tendencies of the heart and the Moon's perceptual movements
 atev bharat main chandrakundali ko mahatv diya jaataa he
 Even in Western countries, people are promoting this ideology
 chunki surya athwa chandra ek raashi main bahut samay tak rahete hai, at: inaki kundaliyon se vibhinn vyaktiyon par honevaale prabhaav kaa thik adhyayan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The apparent lagna changes quickly, so the ascendant is considered to be the actual horoscope of the person
 sookshm fal ke liye hora, dreshkan, navansh kundaliyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The time and duration of giving special results of planets is also fixed
 chandranakshetra kaa vyateet tathaa sampurna bhogyakaal gyaat hone se grahadasha gyaat ho jaati he
 The planets exert their auspicious effects especially in their condition
 kisi grah kii dasha main anya grah bhi apana prabhaav dikhalaate hai
 This is called the inlet of those planets
 isi prakaar grahon kii antar, pratyantar dashaayen bhi hoti he
 From the mutual positions of the planets, a yoga is formed which has special fruit
 vah fal kis samay praapt hoga, iskaa nirnay grahon kii dasha se hi kiya ja saktaa he
 Vinshottari Mahadasha is mainly used in the Indian system
 iske anusaar prayek manushya kii aayu 120 varsh kii maanakar grahon kaa prabhaav bataaya jaataa he
 There are many branches of astrology
 paashchaatya jyotish main inaki sankhya chah he: In Indian astrology, only the Jataka and Samhita are the two main branches
 paashchaatya jyotish kii, tathaa shakhaon kaa jataka main tathaa shesh teen kaa samhita jyotish main antarbhaav ho jaataa he
 Rahu and Ketu are not real houses, they have been observed as Shadow
 grahon ki aapasi mitrataa-shatruta is prakaar he
 If 360 ° is divided by 12, then a sum is 30 °
 yadi 360° ko 27 se vibhajit kiya jaae to ek nakshatra 13°20' kaa hota he, arthath ek raashi me sava-do nakshatra hote he
 Since ancient times, deep belief in astrology was prevalent, which is also contained in the essence of Hermetic Maxim's words "as above, as below"
 tiko brahe ne jyotish par apane adhyayan main ek samaan saransh diya he: "saspisiando despisiyo", upar dekhakar bhi main niche dekhtaa hoon"
 haalanki, yah siddhant jiske anusaar swarg main ghatit ghatnaon kaa pratibimb prithvi par bhi awalokit hota he, duniya bhar main bahut si jyotish paramparaon kaa hissaa he, pashchim main aitihaasik rup se jyotish ke peeche kaam karne vaali kriyavali par jyotishiyon ke bich bahes hoti ai he
 There is also a dispute on whether the celestial bodies are just signs or are they foreshadowing events, or whether they actually conduct real events with some kind of power or mechanism
 bhale hi khagoleey yantriki or sthaliy gatiki ke bich sambandh sabase pehle isaac newton ke gurutvkarshan ke saarvbhaumik siddhant kii khoj se saamne aayaa, lekin khagoleey pindon kaa gurutvkarshan hi unke jyotish prabhaav ko janm detaa he yah baat kisi vaigyanik anusandhan dwaara nahin kahi gai, na hi kisi jyotish ne iskaa samarthan kiya
 Most astrological traditions are based on the relative position and motion of real or approximate celestial bodies, or on the astronomical patterns taken or included in an event at a time and place
 ye mukhyatah hai - jyotish grah, boune grah, kshudragrah, taaren, chandra aasandhi, arabi bhaag or kaalpanik grah 
 is prakaar kii ullekhneey abhaasi sthiti ko ushnkaribandheey yaa taramandal, ek ore se baarah chinhon ke raashichakr or duusari ore se sthaneey kshitij -avarohi aksh) or madhya-akashiya - imam koeli aksh ke dwaara paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 This latter structure is uniquely divided into twelve astrological houses
 iske alaava, ye jyotish ke vibhinn pahalu jyamitiya / koniya or vibhinn khagoleey pindon or konon ke bich sambandh sthapit karata he
 Astrology's claim to predict future trends and events is based on two main methods, in Western astrology: astrological transit and astrological transits
 Astrological transit is interpreted based on the motion of the planets because of space and horoscope
 Their speed is important when passing through
 jyotish pragaman main janm kundali tay padyatiyon ke anusaar samay me aage kii ore babbti he
 Vedic astrology focuses on planetary periods to reach conclusions, while transit is used in important events related to time
 adhikansh pashchimi jyotishiyon ne bhi ghatnaon kaa purvanumaan lagaana chhod diya he, uske badale ve saamaanya pravritiyon or ghatnaon par dhyaan kendrit karte hai
 In comparison, Vedic astrology predicts both trends and events
 sanshaivadiyon ke anusaar pashchimi jyotishiyon kaa ye tarika pramaan yogya anumaan lagane se bachaata he or unhen mahatvapurn se swecchit or asambandhit ghatnaon kaa abhipraay apane suvidhanusaar bataane kaa samarthy detaa he
 In the past, astrology often relied on close observation of celestial bodies and their movement
 aadhunik jyotishi, khagolavidon ke dovara die hue aankaden jo kii ek khagoleey sarini affemerids ke rup main hote hai, jo khagoleey pindon kii samay ke saath badalati raashi chakra sthiti ko darshaati he
 Astrologers have many great traditions, some of which are characterized by the transmission of astrological principles and cultures, and other traditions evolved in isolation and their astrological principles are different, although they are also derived from the same astronomical source
 The reasons are some common features
 aadhunik jyotishiyon dwaara jin mukhya paramparaon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he, wo hai: Vedic and Western astrology are of the same lineage as the horoscope system of astrology, meditation in both traditions is the creation of an astrological table or horoscope, presentation of astronomical elements and knowledge of the position of the sun, moon and planets for information about an event
 However, Vedic astrology uses the nakshatra zodiac to combine the signs of the zodiac with the original nakshatras, while western astrology uses Hnktibndhiy amount using cycles
 vishuon ke purv nirnay ke kaaran, sadiyon baad, pashchimi jyotish ke baarah raashi chinhon kaa unke moulik nakshatron kii tarah akaash ke samaan bhaag se sambandh nahin rahaa
pravhav kii drushti se, pashchimi jyotish main chinhon or nakshatron ke bich sambandh tut gaya he, jabaki vaidic jyotish main abhi bhi iskaa sarvocch mahatv he
 Other differences between the two civilizations include the use of 27 nakshatras or lunar buildings that have been in use in India since the Vedic period and the system of planetary periods known as dasha
 chini jyotish main ek purnataya vibhin parampara kaa vikaas hua he
 In this, unlike the western and Indian astrology, the sky is divided by the celestial equator in place of the twelve zodiac signs
 chineeyon ne ek aisi pranali viksit kii jisamen har chinh din ke baarah 'dohare ghanton ' or saal ke baarah mahino se sambaddh mana jaataa tha
 Each sign of the zodiac governs different years and combines with the five element system of Chinese cosmology to give a 60 year cycle
 yahan yah shabd, chini jyotish suvidha ke liye prayog kiya gaya he, lekin korea, japan, vietnam, thailand or anya asian deshon main thik isi parampara ke sanskaran vidyaman hai
 In modern times, these traditions have come into greater contact with each other, noting that Indian and Chinese astrology are being promoted in the West, while Western astrology is still confined in Asia
 pashchimi duniya main jyotish vigyaan main aadhunik samay main kaafii vividhta ai he
 New movements have appeared that have rejected traditional astrology, focusing on different perspectives, such as overemphasizing the midpoints, or more psychological approaches
 Some recent Western developments: apane lambey itihaas ke dauraan, jyotish vigyaan ne kai kshetron main shoharat praapt kii or parivartan ke saath-saath isamen vikaas bhi hua
 There are many astrological traditions that have historical significance, but today they are of little use
 jyotishiyon kii unamem abhi bhi ruchi barkaraar he or ve use ek mahatvapurn sansaadhan ke rup main dekhte hai
 Historically important traditions of astrology include: pashchimi, chini or bhartiya jyotish ke itihaas kii charchaa itihaas ke mukhya lekhon main kii gai he
 Many Sufi or Gupta traditions have been associated with astrology
 kuch maamalon main, jaise kabbala main, jyotish ke apane paaramparik tatwon ko pratibhaagiyon dwaara ikkatha karke antarbhoot kiya jaataa he
 In other cases, such as in Agama Prophecy, many astrologers incorporate traditions into their work of astrology
 gupt paramparaayen main nimna- likhit chizein shaamil hai, lekin gupt paramparaayen itane tak hi simit nahin hai: According to history, alchemy in the Western world was particularly coherent and blended with the traditional babylonian-greek style of astrology; In many ways, they complement each other in finding occult or occult knowledge
 jyotish ne rasayan vidya kii chaar santhaapit tatwon kii avadharana kaa prachinkaal se lekar vartmaan samay tak upyog kiya he
 Traditionally, each of the seven planets of the solar system has its own dominion zone or dominion and occupies a fixed metal
 raashi chakra, nakshatron kaa ek gheraa yaa samooh he jiske madhyam se surya, chandramaa or grah akaash main pargaman karte hai
 Astrologers paid attention to these constellations and gave them some specific importance
 Over time, he created a system of twelve zodiac signs based on the characteristics of the twelve constellations
 Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces)
 The Western and Vedic zodiac signs have the same origin in the tradition of Kundalini astrology, so the two are similar to each other in many ways
 duusari ore china main, raashi chakra kaa alag tareeke se vikaas hua tha
 Although the Chinese also have a twelve-sign system, the Chinese zodiac refers to the pure almanac cycle, with no equivalent constellation associated with the Western and Indian zodiacs
 pashchimi jyotishiyon ke ek bade hisse ne akaash ko 30 ansh ke baarah baraabar khandon main baatane vaale ushnkaribandheey raashi chakra ko apane kaam kaa aadhaar banaaya jisaki shuruyaat mesh ke pehle bindu se hoti he, jahaan akashiya bumadhya rekha or krantivrutt, uttari golarddh ke valay vishuv par milte hai
 Due to the precession of the gods, the way the Earth rotates in space changes slowly, in this system the zodiac sign has no relation to the constellation with the same name, but rather they live in alignment of months and seasons
 vaidic jyotish kii parampara kaa paalan karne vaale or alp sankhya main yani kuch pashchimi jyotishi samaan nakshatra raashi chakra upyog karte hai
 This zodiac uses the same evenly divided revolution but remains roughly in line with the position of the constellations under consideration with the same name as the zodiac signs
 nakshatra raashi chakra ushnkaribandheey raashi chakra se ayanamsa kahi jane vaali duuri se baraabar duuri se alag he, jo kii vishuon ke jhukaav ke saath-saath aage badhata he
 In addition, some constellations use constellations of real, unequal zodiacs in their work
 jyotish gharon or grahon evam chinhon ke liye banaaai gayi shilp ke namoonay ko prardashit karne vaali The horoscope astrological system developed in the Mediterranean region, and particularly in the area around Hellenistic Egypt, in the second or early first century
 This tradition is related to the two-dimensional diagram of heaven or horoscope at a specific moment in time
 yah chitra vishesh niyamon or disha nirdeshon ke aadhaar par khagoleey pindon ke sanrekhan main chhipe arthon ko samajhane ke liye prayog main laaye jate hai
 a horoscope is usually calculated at the time of the birth of an individual or at the beginning of an enterprise or event, because the celestial alignment at that time is considered to be the determinant of the nature of the subjects we want to know about
 jyotish ke is rup kaa ek vishisht lakshan jo ise dusron se alag karata he wo he - pariksha ke vishisht kshan, jise anyathaa padhaan ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 But in front of the backdrop of the eclipse, calculating the increasing degree of the eastern horizon
 Horoscope of horoscopes is the most influential form of astrology spread across the world, especially in Africa, India, Europe and the Middle East and in the Indian, Middle and Modern West
 Many of the main practices of horoscope, including astrology, originate from Hellenistic traditions
 kundalini jyotish kaa kendra or uski shakhaaen, kundali yaa jyotish ke lekhachitr kii gananaa he
 This two-dimensional drawing representation shows the virtual position of celestial bodies in heaven, with the position on earth, at a given time and place
 kundali bhi baarah vibhinn khagoleey grihon main vibhajit hai jo jivan ke vibhinn kshetron kaa nirdhaaran karte hai
 The calculations in the horoscope involve mathematics and simple geometry based on the apparent position of the heavenly bodies and the astronomical table of time
 pracheen helenistic jyotish main aaroh kundali ke pehle akashiya grih ko parilakshith karata tha
 In Greek, the word horoscopos was used for mounts, which led to the term horoscope
 In modern times, the word refers to astrological accounts
 kundali jyotish kii paramparaon ko chaar shakhaon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he jo kii vishisht vishyon yaa uddeshyon kii ore nirdisht hai
 Often, these branches use a set of unique techniques or different experiments of the fundamentals of the system for a different area
 jyotish ke kai anya up-samucchyon or prayogon kaa armbh chaar moulik shakhaon se hua he
 Trace Riches Huares from Duck d Berry jyotish ke jo siddhant baad main asia, europeor madhya purv main viksit hue unka varnan pracheen babil main bhi he or khagoleey chinhon kii unki pranali duusari sahasrabdi isa purv ke madhya main sankalit kii gai
 Later this system of astronomical signs spread directly or indirectly from Babylon to India, the Middle East and Egypt, where it merged with the pre-existing indigenous forms of astrology
 babil kii jyotish misr main armbh main chauthi shatabbdi ke madhya isa purv main ai thi or duusari or pehali shatabbdi ke shuruyaat main ailekjendria kii vijay ke baad, yah babil jyotish, mistra sabhyataa ke dakshini jyotish se mishrit ho gai or kundali jyotish kaa nirmaan kiya
 The origin of this new form of astrology is believed to be Alexandria Egypt, soon it spread to Europe, Middle East and India in the ancient world
 khagol vigyaan or jyotish ke bich antar jagah jagah par alag he, ve dridhtaa se pracheen bharat, pracheen babil or madhyakaalin europe se judi hui he, lekin helenistic duniya se ek had tak alag he
 The first semantic difference between astrology and astronomy was given in the 11th century by the Persian astronomer abu-rehan-al-biruni
 dekhen)
 The nature of astronomical knowledge acquired from astrological enterprises has been repeated in history in many cultures, from ancient India to Maya civilization to medieval Europe
 Looking at this historical contribution, astrology came to be called pseudo-science as well as proto-science like alchemy
 aadhunik yug se pehle kabhi jyotish ko bina aalochana ke sweekaar nahin kiy gaya; helenistic sanshayi logon, girijaghar adhikariyon or madhyakaalin muslim khagolashastriyon jaise kii al-farabi, , ebn-al- hetham, , abu-rehaan-al-biruni, avisena or aviroz ne ise kaaphi chunautiyaan deen

 There have been many innovations in astrological practice in modern times
 jyotish vigyaan kaa pashchimi tathaa purvi samskritiyon par gaharaa prabhaav padaa he
 In the Middle Ages, when educated people believed in astrology, heavenly bodies were considered as a system of knowledge and a system of reflection of the world beneath them
 jyotish ne vigyaan bhashaa or sahitya donon ko prabhavit kiya he
 For example, the word influenza, or cold, was derived from the medieval Latin word influencia, because it was believed by physicians that the epidemic was caused by adverse planets and stellar effects
 shabd aapadaa, "disaster" italian shabd disastro se liya gaya he jo kii ek "naakaaratmak upsarg" dis or latin shabd astor " tara" se vyutpann he, jiskaa matlab he bure taare yaa "dusht-nakshatra"

 In literature, several authors, notably Geoffrey Chaucer and William Shakespeare, used astrological signs to describe their characters and thus closely drew into that description
 Recently, Michele Ward stated that CS Louis, the author of the Chronicles of Narnia, dotted his creation with characters and symbols from the Seven Heavens
 aksar, jyotish pratikon ko samajhane vaale saahitiyon kii saraahna karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 Some modern thinkers especially, Carl Jung believed that astrology has the power to read the mind and to predict the future
 The field of education is reflected in the university education of Middle Europe, which was divided into seven separate areas, among which Each was represented by one planet and was known as the seven independent arts
 dante alighiri ne vichaar kiya ki ye kalaayen jo aaj us vigyaan main badal chuki hai, jise ham bhalee bhaati jaanate hai, usee dhaanche main feet baithti hai jisamen grahon ko feet kiya jaataa he
 The most famous example of astrology in music is the orchestra suite, "the Planets", designed by the British composer Gustav Host, whose structure is based on the astrological signs of the planets
 francis bekan or vaijaanik kranti ke samay se shuru hui vaigyanik shikshan ki nai shakhaaen, praayogic avlokanon par aadhaarit pranalibaddh praayogic prerana ke tareekon par aadhaarit hone lagi

 This isolation intensified during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
 saanchaa:infobox Pseudoscience Contemporary scientists such as Richard Dawkins and Stephen Hawkins called astrology unscientific and Andrew Fraknoi of the Society of Pacific Astronomy called it pseudoscience
 In 1975, the American Humanist Organization made reference to those believing in astrology that those people believe in astrology even though their belief has no proven scientific basis but there is many evidence against it
 jyotirvid karl segan ne paaya kii wo is vaktavy par hatakshar nahin kar sakate, isliye nahin kii wo ye sochate he kii jyotish maanya he balki isliye kyunki unhen lagata he kii is vaktavy kaa lahaza sattavadi he
 Segan said that he would have been willing to sign a statement and would have rejected the main principles of astrological belief, which would have been more convincing and less controversial than this statement
 bhale hi ek samay main jyotish shaastra kaa bada hi simit sthaan rahaa ho, lekin 20 ve shatabdi kii shuruyaat se hi ye jyotish shastriyon ke bich anusandhan kaa vishay rahaa he
 In the historical study of nascent astrology research in the 20th century, astrological critic Jeffrey Dean and co-authors produced a rich research work, which was primarily within the community of astrology
