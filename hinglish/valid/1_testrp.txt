 It is estimated that there will be some 4 million Mongol speakers in all these areas
 in vishaal kshetron main rahanevaale mongol jati ke sab logon ke dwaara sweekrut koi ek adarsh bhashaa nahin he
 But within the so-called Mongolia, the Halha dialect of Democracy Mongol is gradually assuming the role of ideal language
 swayan mongolia ke log bhi is halha boli ko parishkrut boli maanate hai or isi boli ke nikat bhavishya main adarsh bhashaa banane kii sambhaavna he
 In ancient times, the literary Mongol written in the Mongol script was considered an ideal language among the educated people
 parantu ab yah mongol lipi janatantr mongolia dwaara tyaag di gai he or isaki jagah roosi lipi se banaai gai nai mongol lipi sweekaar kii gai he
 Thus, now the literary language written in Mongol script is less and the Halah dialect written in New Mongol script is considered more valid

 jin yogicon ke gun ek se hote hai unke sanghathan bhi ek se hi hote hai or jinke gun bhinn hote hai unke sanghathan bhi bhinn hote hai
 Later it was found that there are some compounds whose organization, molecule and molecule are different even though their properties are different
 aise vishistataa yogicon ko samaavyavi sangya di gai or is tathy kaa naam samavyawata rakhaa gaya
 There are mainly two types of isomorphism: one is called structure isomerism and the other is three-dimensional isomerism
 yadi do yogicon ke anubhaar or anusutra ek hi hon, par unke gunon main vibhinnata ho, to iskaa yahi kaaran ho saktaa he ki unke anu kii sanrachanaon main vibhinnata he
 The two simplest compounds are ethyl alcohol and dimethyl ether, which have the same molecular weight and the atom, C2 H6 O, but their structures are different
 ethil alcodaul main do carbon parmaanu paraspar sambhddha hokar, hydroxil samooh se sanyukt hai jabaki diemethil ether main do carbon parmaanu oxigen parmaanu dwaara ek duusare se sambhddha hai
 The properties of both vary greatly
 unki kriya se vibhinnata spasht ho jaati he
 The action of HI on ethyl alcohols produces ethyl iodide, C2 H5 I, while dimethyl ether forms methyl iodide
 anya abhikarmakon ke saath bhi aisi bhinn kriyaayein hoti hai
 If the isomerism of such compounds is such that the isomerism is between the compounds of the same class, then the isomerism is called interstitiality
 iskaa udhaaharan dyethil ether or methil propil ether he
 Many such examples are found in paraffin class hydrocarbons
 painta ke teen samavyav hote hai : narmal paintain, iso-paintain or niopentain
 Such isomerism is also called series isomerism, because here there is variation due to difference in the series itself
 isi samavyawata se milti-julati ek duusari samavyawata he, jise sthaan-samavyawata kehete hai, iskaa saralatam udhaaharan propil chloride or isopropil chloride he, jinamein antar keval chlorine parmaanu ke sthaan se sambandh rakhata he
 In one, chlorine is associated with one carbon atom at the end and chlorine in the other is associated with the middle carbon
 isi prakaar kii samavyawata dychlorobenzone main bhi he
 Isomerism in the compound can occur due to the atoms being arranged in different directions even though the molecular weight and composition of the compounds remain the same
 aisi samavyawata ko trivim samavyawata kehete hai
 There are two types of three-dimensional isomerism: lactic amla ke adhyayan main dekha gaya he ki lactic amla teen prakaar kaa hota he, do prakaashat: sakriy or ek prakaashat: niskriy
 Similarly, tartaric acid is also of four types, two lightly active and two lightly inactive
 inaki upasthiti kii santoshprad vyakhya us samay tak gyaat siddhanton se nahin ho sakati thi
 The theory that has been proposed to explain them is called the theory of stereoscopic isomerism and this has laid the foundation for a new branch of chemistry, called stereoscopic chemistry
 is nae siddhant ke pratipadak dach rasayanajna, vaant hof or duusare francisi rasayanajna, laa bel ho sakati he
 Both of these forms are the same as an object and its reflection
 ek vyavastha prakaash ko ek ore jitna ghumaati he, duusari vyavastha prakaash ke vipareet disha main utana hi ghumayegi
 Thus there can be two optical forms of such a compound
 yadi ye donon rup sammatra main kisi vilyan main vidyaman hon, to aisa vilyan prakaashat: niskriy hoga
 In fact inactive lactic acid is such a mixture, because f it can be differentiated into two active lactic acids by several methods
 chatushfalak ke madhya main sthit carbon parmaanu ko asamamit carbon parmaanu kehete hai or prakaash sakriyata ke liye ek yaa ek se adhik asamit carbon parmaanu kaa hona anivaary he
 In the absence of this, optical activation is not possible
 anubhav or prayogon se yah baat bilkul thik pramanit hoti he
 Tartaric acid has two asymmetric carbon atoms
 tarteric amla kii visheshta yah he ki iske donon asamamit carbon ke saath ek hi prakaar ke samooh sambhddha hai
 If both are connected groups with a asymmetric carbon, which are counterclockwise, the compound will be clockwise and if both asymmetric carbons are associated with groups that are counterclockwise, then that compound will be counterclockwise and if both are asymmetric carbon with one clockwise and the other
 If the counterclockwise group is associated, the effect of one will deactivate the other, making that compound lightly inactive
 par yah yogic aisa niskriy hoga ki use sakriy nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 a similar form of tartaric acid is mezzo-tartaric acid
 chauthaa tarteric amla aisa ho saktaa he jisamen dakshinavadrt or vamavart tarteric amla kii sammatra vidyaman ho
 Such a compound is racemic acid
 yah bhi prakaashat: niskriy hota he, par sakriy avyavon main vibhedit kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus this theory easily explains the presence of four types of tartaric acid
 is prakaar kii trivim samavyawata keval carbonic yogickon main hi nahin pai gai hai, varan nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, gandhak or silicon aadi ke yogicon main bhi pai gai he
 Geometric isomerism does not have light activation
 yah samavyawata unheen yogicon main pai jaati he jinamein do carbon parmaanu yugma bandha se bandhe hote hai
 If more than one group is attached to both carbon atoms of such compounds, then two compounds of the following types can be formed from it
 ek, jisamen donon samooh ek hi paksh main hai or doosraa, jisamen donon samooh pratikul paksh main hai
 The first compounds are called sys and the second are trans
 aise yogicon main yugma bandha ke kaaran anu main dridhtaa hoti he, jisase uskaa mukt sanchaalan avaruddh ho jaataa he
 The simplest examples of such isomer compounds are malic and fumaric acids
 malaik amla main donon carboxil samooh ek hi paksh main hote hai or fumeric amla main donon carboxil samooh pratikul paksh main
 This is confirmed by the fact that malic acid produces anhydride very quickly, indicating the proximity of the carboxyl group, and that fumaric acid does not produce anhydride so quickly, indicating the distance of the carboxyl group
 yadi ainhydride kathinata se banataa bhi he, to vah malaik ainhydride hi hota he
 Such isomerism does not require that one carbon atom be combined with another carbon atom
 carbon yadi nitrogen ke saath sanyukt ho, to bhi aise samaavyavi banate hai
 Examples of this are many oximes, which are formed by the action of hydranxyl amine on ketones
 ek duusare prakaar kii samavyawata ko chal samavyawata, yaa chalavyawata kehete hai
 It is caused by the transfer of an element in compounds, especially hydrogen, from one place to another
 iskaa acha udhaaharan kito-inol-samavyawata he, jisamen ek hi padaarth kabhi kitone sa vyavhaar karata he or kabhi inol sa
 Here the change of one isomer to another is accomplished only by dissolving in the solvent, or by the presence of a catalyst
 aisi hi samavyawata ke kaaran sharkaraaon kaa parivarti ghurnan hota he
 1810 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 1810 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 It is considered a collective year based on the Julian calendar

 In India, there are many famous Panchagas like Vikram Samvat which begins 57 or 58 years before the birth of Jesus

 Shaka Samvat is the ancient era of India which begins 78 years after the birth of Jesus
 shaq samvath bharat kaa rashtriya calendar he
 Some other ancient era prevalent in India are as follows- uparokt antar ke aadhaar par 1810 isa purv ke anusaar vikrami samvath, saptarshi samvath, kaliyug samvath or pracheen saptarshi aadi main varsh aadi nikaale ja sakate he

 The Mediterranean Sea dried up over time and the concentration of salt in its water increased

 The Strait started opening up about 53
3 lakh years ago
 yah pehle to ruk-ruk ke hua lekin phir jalsandhi puri tarah khul gai
 Due to this, the water of Atlantic Ocean started to fall in the Mediterranean Sea due to the fierce flow
 anumaan lagaaya jaataa he ki bumadhya sagar ko puri tarah bharne main kuch mahino se lekar 2 varshon tak kaa samay laga
 Paving of the Mediterranean Sea is about 1 km below the Atlantic, and the current would have plunged into the Mediterranean Sea with a 1000-meter-per-second sea-water roar

 Vayanasura did a lot of hard penance of Lord Shankar
 shankar ji ne uske tap se prasann hokar use sahastra bahu tathaa apaar bal de diya
 Nobody fought him with fear of his thousand arms and immense force
 isi kaaran se vanasur ati ahamkaari ho gaya
 Even after a long time, when no one fought with him, he came to Lord Shankar one day and said, "O God of the pasture world! i have a strong desire to fight, but no one fights me
 atah krupa karke aap hi mujhase yuddh kariye
 "lord Shankar got angry after hearing his ego, but Vansur was his devotee, so after quelling his anger, he said," You fool! a person who has broken your ego has been born after fighting with you
 jab tere mahal kii dhwaja gir jaave tabhi samaj lenaa ki tera shatru aa chukaa he
 " vanasur kii ushaa naam kii ek kanya thi
 Once Usha saw Anirudh, grandson of Shri Krishna and son of Pradyuman in a dream and was fascinated by it
 usne apane swapn kii baat apni sakhi chitralekha ko bataaya
 Chitralekha made a picture of Anirudh with his yoga force and showed it to Usha and asked, "did you see this in your dream?" Usha said, "yes, this is my brain
" ab main inke bina nahin rah sakati
 "chitralekha went to Dwarka and brought Aniruddha to the palace of Usha with a bed
 neend khulne par aniruddh ne swayan ko ek naye sthaan par paaya or dekha ki uske paas ek anindya sundari baithi hui he
 On Anirudh's questioning, Usha reveals that she is the daughter of Vayanasura and wishes to get Anirudh as her husband
 aniruddh bhi ushaa par mohit ho gayi or vahiin uske saath mahal main hi rahane lage
 The guards suspect that some outsider must have entered Usha's palace
 unhone jaakar vanasur se apane sandeh ke vishay main bataaya
 At the same time, Vayanasura saw the flag of his palace collapsed
 use nishchay ho gaya ki koi meraa shatru hi ushaa ke mahal main pravesh kar gaya he
 He arrives at the palace of Usha, armed with weapons
 usne dekha ki uski putree ushaa ke sameep pitambar vastra pahane bade bade netron vaala ek saanwala salona purush baitha hua he
 Vamsur got angry and challenged Anirudh to battle
 uski lalkaar sunakar aniruddh bhi yuddh ke liye prastut ho gayi or unhone lohe ke ek bhayankar mudgar ko uthaa kar usee ke dwaara vanasur ke samast angrakshakon ko maar daalaa
 There was a fierce war in Vansur and Anirudh
 jab vanasur ne dekha ki aniruddh kisi bhi prakaar se uske kaabo main nahin aa rahaa he to usne nagapasha se unhen baandhakar bandi bana liya
 Here Anirudh started being searched in Dwarka Puri and when he was not found, there was mourning and envy
 tab devarshi naarad ne vahaan pahunch kar aniruddh kaa sara vrittant kaha
 On this, Shri Krishna, Balarama, Pradyumna, Satyiki, Gad, Samb etc
 along with all the Veer Chaturangini army reached the town of Sonaspur in Vaisnura and attacked and destroyed the gardens, park, turret etc
 akraman kaa samachar sun vanasur bhi apni sena ko saath lekar aa gaya
 Shri Balaram ji confronted the demons of Kumbhand and Kupakarna, started a battle with Anirudh Karthikeya and Sri Krishna came in front of Vansur
 ghanghor sangram hone laga
 There was a shower of arrows everywhere
 balram ne kumbhand or coopakarna ko maar daalaa
 When Banasura started thinking that he could not defeat Shri Krishna, he remembered Bhagwan Shankar
 ant main usne bhagwan shankar ko yaad kiya
 Hearing the call of Banasura, Lord Shiva sent an army of Rudras to assist Banasura
 shivganon kii sena ne shrikrishna par chaaro or se akraman kar diya lekin shrikrishna or shribalram ke saamne unhen haar kaa muh dekhnaa padaa
 shivganon ko parast kar shrikrishna phir banasur par tut pade

 bhagwaan shiv ne shrikrishna ko waapas jane ko kaha lekin jab shrikrishna kisi tarah bhi peeche hatane ko taiyaar nahin hue to vivash hokar bhagwaan shiv ne apana trishul uthaaya

 ab to donon main bhayankar yuddh hone laga
 shivaji ke aage shrikrishnake sabhi astr naakaam rahe
shivaji par ant me shrikrishna ne apana narayanastra chalaa diya
 But he too fell in front of Shiva
 ant main shrikrishna jaan gayi kii shivaji ke yubhumi me rahete ve banasur kaa bal bhi bankaa nahi kar sakenge
 Hence, he started praising Shiva
 shivaji prasann hokar bole ki he krishna banasur ko diya vachan todkar mai yubhumi se to hat nahi saktaa
 However, i will provide a solution
 tum mujhapar jrimbhanastra kaa prayog karo
 i will not retaliate usase kuch der tak mai so jaaungaa
 Sri Krishna did the same
 bhagwan shiv ke so jane ke baad shrikrishna punah banasur par tut pade
 banasur bhi ati krodh main aakar unpar tut padaa
 ant main shrikrishna ne apana sudarshan chakra niklaa or banasur kii bhujaaen katni prarambh kar di
 Sri Krishna cut off all four sides except the four arms of Vansasur
 tab jaage hue bhagwaan shiv ne vanasur se kaha “re murkh, ye krishna vishnu ke avatar he inke saamne tu apni uddandata dikhaanaa chod de varanaa tuje mere bhi krodh kaa saamana karnaa padega”
 By obeying Lord Shiva, Shri Krishna gave up the idea of dying of Banasura, after hearing Lord Shankar, Vayanasura fell at the feet of Shri Krishna and started apologizing to him
 shrikrishna ne vanasur ko kshamaadaan diya or aniruddh ke saath usha kaa vivaah sampann hua

 inako urdu bhashaa kaa sarvakalik mahaan shaayar mana jaataa he or farsi kavita ke pravaah ko hindustani jabaan main lokapriy karwaane kaa shrey bhi inako diya jaataa he
 However, in earlier years, Mir Taki "mir" is also known for this reason
 gaalib ke likhe patr, jo us samay prakashit nahin hue the, ko bhi urdu lekhan kaa mahatvapurn dastauez mana jaataa he
 Ghalib is known as an important poet in India and Pakistan
 unhe dabeer-ul-mulk or nazm-ud-daula kaa khitaab mila
 Mirza, who wrote Ghalib, was also a court poet of Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last ruler of the Mughal period
 agra, dilli or kalakatta main apni zindagi gujaarne vaale gaalib ko mukhyatah unki urdu gazalon ko liye yaad kiya jaataa he
 He wrote about himself that there are many good poets and poets in the world, but his style is most unique: haalanki gaalib ko aupchaarik shiksha nahin mili, lekin unhone mullah abdushamaad se arabi, farsi, tark or darshan main apane sabak siikhe or bauddhik str par apane aap main vruddhi kii
 After the demise of Sheikh Ibrahim Jauk, who had the privilege of advising Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar on his poetry, he was appointed as his advisor, as well as the historian of the Mughal court, “hai or bhi duniya main sukhnvar bahut achchhekahate hai ki gaalib kaa he andaaz-e bayaan or” Ghalib was born in Agra into a family with a military background
 unhone apane pita or chachaa ko bachapan main hi kho diya tha, gaalib kaa jeevanyaapan mulat: apane chachaa ke maranoparant milane vaale pension se hota tha 
 Ghalib had a background from an Ottoman family and his grandfather came to India from Samarkand in Central Asia around 1750
 unke dada mirza quobaan beg khan ahamed shah ke shashan kaal main samarkand se bharat aaye
 He worked in Delhi, Lahore and Jaipur and eventually settled in Agra
 unke do putr va teen putriyaan thi
 Mirza Abdullah Beg Khan and Mirza Nasrullah Beg Khan had two sons
 mirza abdulla beg ne izzat-ut-nisa begum se nikaah kiya or apane sasur ke ghar main rahane lage
 He worked first with the Nawab of Lucknow and later with the Nizam of Hyderabad
 1803 main alvar main ek yuddh main unki mrityu ke samay gaalib maatr 5 varsh ke the
 When Ghalib was younger, a neo-muslim-turned-politician came to Delhi from Iran and Ghalib learned Persian by staying in his company
 gaalib kii praarambhik shiksha ke bare main spashtatah kuch kaha nahin ja saktaa lekin gaalib ke anusaar unhone 11 varsh kii avasthaa se hi urdu evam farsi main gadhy tathaa padya likhane armbh kar diya tha
 He wrote compositions mostly in Persian and Urdu on traditional devotional and aesthetic rasa which is written in Ghazal
 unhone farsi or urdu dono main paaramparik geet kavy kii rahasyamay-romantic style main sabase vyapak rup se likhaa or yah ghazal ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 At the age of 13, he was married to Umrao Begum, daughter of Nawab Elahi Bakhsh
 vivaah ke baad vah dilli aa gayi the jahaan unki tamaam umr beeti
 In connection with his pension, he had to travel for a long trip to Kolkata, which is mentioned in his ghazals from place to place
 1850 main shahenshaah bahadur shah zafar dwitiya ne mirza gaalib ko dabeer-ul-mulk or nazm-ud-daula ke khitaab se nawaaza
 Later he also got the title of Mirza Nosha
 ve shahenshaah ke darbar main ek mahatvapurn darbari the
 He was also appointed as the teacher of Rajkumar Fakr-ud-din Mirza, the eldest son of Bahadur Shah Zafar II
 ve ek samay main mughal darbar ke shahi itihasvid bhi the
 a newspaper or a newspaper is a publication based on news, in which information, mainly current affairs, politics, sports, personalities, advertisements, etc
, are printed on cheap paper
 samachar patr sanchaar ke sadhano main mahatvapurn sthaan rakhte hai
 Newspapers are usually daily, but some newspapers are weekly, fortnightly, monthly and even half-yearly
 adhiktar samachaarpatr sthaneey bhashaaon main or sthaneey vishyon par kendrit hote hai
 The earliest known newspaper was 59 BC
 Is 'the Roman Acta Diurna'
 julies sisar ne janasadhran ko mahatvapurn rajnatijna or samaajik ghatnaon se avgat karaane ke liye unhe shahro ke pramukh sthano par preshit kiya
 Handwritten newspapers were introduced in China in the 8th century
 akhbaar kaa itihaas or yogadan: yun to british shashan ke ek purv adhikari ke dwaara akhabaaron kii shuruyaat maani jaati he, lekin uskaa swaroop akhabaaron kii tarah nahin tha
 It was only a one-page informational paper
 purnroopen akhbaar bengal se 'bengal-gajet' ke naam se vysarai hikki dwaara nikaala gaya tha
 Initially, the British used newspapers for their own benefit, as all newspapers were coming out in English, so news and information could not reach the majority of people
 jo khabaren baahar nikalakar aati thintra se guzarate, vahaan apana aatank failaate rahete the
 There were neither cases nor any punishment against them
 in naarkeey paristhitiyon ko jhelte hue bhi log khamosh the
 During this period, newspapers such as 'the Hindustan Times', 'national Herald', 'pioneer', 'mumbai-mirror' in India used to come out in English, in which there was no mention of those atrocities
 in angreji patron ke atirikt bangala, urdu aadi main patron kaa prakaashan to hota rahaa, lekin uskaa dayera simit tha
 Only a Bengali reader or a person who knew Urdu could understand it
 aise main pehali baar 30 may 1826 ko hindi kaa pratham patr ‘udant martand’ kaa pehla ank prakashit hua
 This letter was weekly
 ‘udant-martand' kii shuruyaat ne bhashaayi str par logon ko ek sutara main baandhane kaa prayaas kiya
 It was not just a letter, but the tongue of thousands of people who were still silent and frightened
 hindi main patron kii shuruyaat se desh main ek krantikari parivartan hua or aazaadee kii jang
 They were twisted and presented so that the news of the atrocities of the British Government would be suppressed
 angrej sipaahi kisi bhi kshetra main ghuskar manamaana vyavhaar karte the
 Incidents like robbery, murder, rape were common
 wo jis bhi ksheko bhi ek nai disha mili
 Now people started getting information about the events happening in the corner of the country
 lekin kuch hi samay baad is patr ke sampadak jugal kishor ko sahaayta ke abhaav main 11 disambar 1827 ko patr band karnaa padaa
 On 10 May 1829, the Hindi newspaper Bangdoot was published from Bengal
 yah patr bhi logon kii aawaaj bana or unhen jode rakhane kaa madhyam
 After this, in July 1854, Shyamsunder Sen published the 'samachar Sudha Varshana' from Calcutta
 us dauraan jin bhi akhabaaron ne angreji hukumat ke khilaaf koi bhi khabar yaa aalekh chapa, use uski keemat chukaani padi
 Newspapers were banned
 uski pratiyaan jalawaai jaati thim, uske prakashkon, sampadakon, lekhakon ko dand diya jaataa tha
 He was fined heavily so that he could not muster the courage to rise again
 aazaadee kii lahar jis tarah puure desh main fail rahi thi, akhbaar bhi atyaacharon ko sahakar or mukhar ho rahe the
 This was the reason that after partition of Bengal, the voice of Hindi letters became more elevated
 lokmaanya tilak ne 'kesari' kaa sampadan kiya or lala lajpat raay ne punjab se 'vande maataram' patr nikaala
 These letters called for greater cooperation in the freedom struggle of the youth
 in patron ne aazaadee paane kaa ek jajba paidaa kar diya
 'kesari' was removed from Nagpur by Madhavrao Sapre, but the letter was banned due to Tilak's provocative articles
 uttar bharat main aazaadee kii jang main jaan phunkane ke liye ganesh shankar vidhyaarthee ne 1913 main kanpur se saptahik patr 'pratap' kaa prakaashan aarambh kiya
 It used to publish information about atrocities in every part of the country
 isse logon main aakrosh bhadakne laga tha or ve british hukumat ko ukhaad phenkane ke liye or bhi utsahit ho uthe the
 In view of its aggression, the British administration gave various harassment to its writers and editors, but this paper remained on its target
 isi prakaar bengal, bihar, maharashtra ke kshetron se patron kaa prakaashan hota rahaa
 Those letters tried to spread the urge for people to gain freedom and spread awareness
 agar yah kaha jaae ki swatantraaa senaniyon ke liye ye akhbaar kisi hathiyaar se kamatar nahin the, to koi atishyokti nahin hogi
 The freedom weapon of the newspaper became as independent and outspoken as the press is today, it was bound by restrictions and restrictions in the freedom struggle
 na to usamen manoranjan kaa put tha or na hi ye kisi kii kamai kaa jariya hi
 These newspapers and magazines were a weapon and medium of freedom fighters, which kept them connected to people and events
 aazaadee kii ladaai kaa koi bhi aisa yoddha nahin tha, jisane akhabaaron ke jariye apni baat kehane kaa prayaas na kiya ho
 Gandhiji also published newspapers in the name of 'harijan', 'young-india', while Maulana Abul Kalam Azad published 'al-hilal'
 aise or kitne hi udhaaharan hai, jo yah sabit karte hai ki patr-patrikaon kii aazaadee kii ladaai main mahati bhoomika thi
 This was a period when people had no means of communication
 us par bhi angrejon ke atyaacharon ke shikaar asahaay log chupchaap saare atyachar sehate the
 Neither one was going to listen to them nor to defeat their sorrows
 wo kehete bhi to kisase or kaise? har koi to usee pratadna ko jhel rahe the
 In such a situation, the introduction of magazines and magazines gave courage to the people, and encouraged them
 yahi kaaran tha ki krantikariyon ke ek-ek lekh janata main nai sphurti or deshbhakti kaa sanchaar karte the
 When Bharatendu's play 'bharat-plight' was published, people got to experience how the people of India are going through and what is the intention of the British

 After this, he keeps roaming the earth and on the same day Jaggu meets Sarfaraz

 When Jaggu tells this to his father, he flatly refuses, because he lives a Pakistani

 Jaggu then returns directly to India from Brijes

 When Jaggu approaches Sarfaraz, he learns the truth

 The landscape, its characteristic and quality, help define the self-image of a region and, the emotional sensations of that place, which distinguish it from other regions
 yah logon ke jivan kii gatisheel prishthbhumi he
 There is a wide expanse of natural scenery on Earth including icy landscapes of the polar regions, mountainous landscape, extensive desert landscape, natural scenery of islands and beaches, natural forests of dense forests or trees, including old tropical forests and tropical rainforests and temperate and tropical Areas include arable landscapes prakritik drishyon kii samiksha aage

 Meaningfully, the term is equivalent to the German Landshaft which refers to a small administrative unit or region
 baad main yah shabd upyog se baahar ho gaya or 11veen sadi main dumsde book ke samay tak yah shabd latin bhashaa ke kisi bhi anuwaad main dikhaai nahin diya
 The modern form of the word with its visual interpretations emerged in the 16th century when the term landscape was introduced by Dutch painters with reference to painters of inland natural or rural landscapes
 landscape ko sabase pehle 1598 main darj kiya gaya tha, jise 16veen sadi ke dauraan ek chitrakaar sambandhi shabd ke rup main dach bhashaa se liya gaya tha, jab dach chitrakaar prakritik drishy nirmaan kala ke kshetra main paarangat hone kii sthiti main the
 At first the Dutch word Landschap meant only an area or part of the land but was then adopted for artistic expressions, which was incorporated into English to describe a visual image on the land
 jackson ke anusaar: "harrison dwaara britain kii vyakhya ke saath 1577 ke baad se, prakritik drishy kii soundaryatmak prakruti kii nayi vyakhya ek nae tarah ke nikhare sthalakritik lekhan ke rup main ubharkar saamne aayi
 

 "
 Originally the term was translated as landscape, which the Oxford English Dictionary described as an aberrant form of the word, then gradually replaced by landscape
 Before referring to the use of the English word for physical landscape
 It is not recorded anywhere
 german shabd landshaft par ek gahan vishleshan par dhyaan kendrit karte hue ek richard hartshorn ne landscape ko ek "prithvi kii ek bahari, dikhaai dene yogya sataha ke rup main paribhaashit kiya
 This surface is formed from external surfaces that come into immediate contact with the atmosphere, flora, wastelands, ice, or aquatic organisms or man-made features
 hartshorn ne is shabd ko rigen se alag rakhaa jo unki samaj main ek adhik bade or lacheele aakaar kaa he
 They removed the sky on this basis because the atmosphere is the only medium through which the surface of the Earth is seen and does not include underground mineral production work, soil under rain and rain
 haalanki, unhone chalyman vastuon ko is tipanni ke saath shaamil kiya ki broadway kaa koi drishy iske trephic ke bagaiyr adhuraa he
 He ignored the inclusion of oceans in the landscape
 In addition to the visuals, he opposed the interpretation of natural scenes, such as the sound and smell on the land, because all these do not explain any unified concept
 In terms of the concept of natural scenes having natural and cultural significance, Karl Saura held a different view from others, stating that "as soon as there is a human presence in the scene, the natural existence of the landscape ceases"
 Referring to the term primeval landscape, he said that while it may mean a pre-human landscape, the current natural landscape means "a theoretical hypothesis that never existed"
 1920 or 1930 ke dashak ke dauraan, aisi kaary-pranaliyaan viksit kii gayin jisase prakritik drishy bhugol kaa vishisht nahin to anivaary vishay ban gaya
 From the solar point of view, the interpretation came out that the role of geography was a systematic investigation of the "theory of landscape"
 saura ne prakritik drishyon ko mote taur par un kshetron ke rup main dekha jo bhautikeey evam prakritik, donon prakaar ke swaroopon kaa vishisht samooh he or prakritik drishy ke adhyayan ko swaabhaavik prakritik drishyon se saanskrithik mahatv ke prakritik drishyon main viksit hone kaa pataa lagaana kaha
 From the 1940s onwards, the concept was adopted as physicists found that the difficulties associated with reconstructing the past are frightening and reflect their primary concern with the present world
 paryaavaran par maanviya prabhaav kii jaankaree hone ke saath-saath swaabhaavik prakritik drishy kii avadharana par teji se sawaal uthaaye jane lage
 haal ke dinon ke bhautikvettaon ne maanviya bhugol ke antargat kisi sthaan kii vyaktiparak visheshtaon ko samajhaayaa he or is prakaar kisi kshetra ke vastuparak or vyaktiparak moolyankan ke bich ke pul ko paar kiya he
 The popular notion of landscape as stated in dictionaries gives a special and general meaning; The special reference and general meaning of an area of the Earth's surface is that which can be seen by an observer
 haal ke dashakon main manovaigyanikon dwaara paryaavaran kii samaj par adhik se adhik dhyaan dene se, prakritik drishy ko us kachche maal ke rup main dekha jaataa he jisase maanviya dharanaon or maanviya soochna pranali kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Thus Daniels and Cosgrove defined landscape not as a physical vocabulary but as a public expression of human perception: "the landscape is a cultural image and an illustrated medium of representation, structuralism, or notation of surrounding things" is
 " minig ne manovaigyanik or bhautik, donon pahaluon ko sanyukt rup se dekha: "koi bhi prakritik drishy na keval hamaari aankhon ke saamne kii cheez he balki vah he jo hamaare mastishk ke andar maujuud he
 
 haal ke dashakon main paryaavaran shabd kaa upyog kaaphi teji se badha he
 Jay Appleton kept the environment separate from the landscape, stating that the landscape is "a familiar environment"
 jaisaa ki borasa ne tipanni kii, prakritik drishy ke banispat paryaavaran shabd kaa ek laabh yah he ki paryaavaran ko shahari drishyon se adhik behatar samajha ja saktaa he, haalanki shahari prakritik drishy shabd bhi aam taur par upyog main he
 Since the term environment encompasses the entire physical, biological, cultural and aesthetic components of a particular area, it is generally understood to be a very broad and within a scope for a natural view
 seen, sinik or sinari jaise shabd prakritik drishy kii sateek vyakhya prastut nahin karte hai
 Look at the origin of the word in the theater, where scene means a part of a play, thus scene can be a part of a natural scene
 sinari, jo kisi stage par upyukt ek sajaavati prishthbhumi ko darshata he, saath hi yah kisi sthaan ke saamaanya swarup, visheshkar ek chitratmak sandarbh ko bataata he
 Although it can be used interchangeably with landscape, it does not convey the same depth of meaning
 prakritik drishy saundarya shaastra yaa sirf saundarya shaastra shabd kaa sahitya main aksar istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The origins of aesthetics are far more controversial than the landscape
 ise greek shabd asthesis se liya gaya he, jiskaa arth he "bhaavnaatmak samaj
" is shabd kaa upyog ek yuva german darshanik elexander baumgarton dwaara asthetica ke sheershak ke rup main kiya jaataa tha, jinhone is greek shabd kaa upyog galat tareeke se saundarya kii aalochana yaa swaad ke siddhant ke rup main kiya
 Thus the term which actually applies to a wide field of emotional understanding was limited to the field of taste
 emenual kaint ne 1781 main is upyog kii aalochana kii or ise iske sundartam arth "bhaavnaatmak samaj kaa darshanashastra" ke rup main istemaal kiya"
 haalanki, 1830 ke baad england main pravesh pate hi ashuddh shabd asthetics kii lokapriyata badhane lagi or oxford english dictionari ke anusaar, baumgarton dwaara iske arth kii nayi vyakhya ke ek sadi ke andar hi, samooche europe main iskaa vyapak rup se prayog hone laga tha
 Dictionary interpretation of aesthetics dispels Baumgarten's error and calls it "things perceived by the senses rather than things that are contemplative or immaterial", "relating to the sense of beauty or the science of aesthetics" Macri Dictionary, 1981
, or " In the sense of or related to aesthetics or beauty "defines as things"
 Aesthetics is one such philosophy Is seen as a test of the "nature and rules of art tastes and principles, Fine Arts detects theory; Aesthetics 


 "or" is used with the nature of beauty and with aesthetic decisions "

 This incident is considered to be the beginning of the establishment of the British Raj in India and later Mir Jaffer's name became the epitome of 'traitor' and 'gaddar' in the Indian subcontinent

 Chandrabhanu Gupta's political career began in 1926
 He was made a member of Uttar Pradesh Congress and All India Congress Committee
 Chandrabhanu had made his mark in the Congress in a very short time as soon as he entered politics
 He immediately became the Treasurer, Vice President and President of the UP Congress
 In the election of 1937, he was elected a member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly
 Then in the first state government formed in 1946 after independence, he joined Govindballabh Pant's cabinet as Parliamentary Secretary
 He then worked as a minister of several departments from 1948 to 1959
 In 1960, he was made the Chief Minister of UP
 At that time, he was an MLA from Ranikhet South
 Politics had become very complicated when Sampurnanand was the Chief Minister
 Many factions were formed in the Congress
 In such a situation, Sampurnanand was made the Governor of Rajasthan and Chandrabhanu was the Chief Minister of UP
 Meanwhile, Gupta's stature had increased a lot in UP politics
 Becoming the Chief Minister was a landslide victory over all types of opposition
 This created panic among the leaders of the Center
 This was the period when the Congress people started challenging Nehru's power at the Center
 Chandrabhanu was not completely influenced by Nehru's socialism
 So Nehru did not like them
 But in the UP Congress, Chandrabhanu was so angry that the mlas were first bowed down in front of Chandrabhanu, and later in front of Nehru
 Nehru not like this In 1963, k Kamaraj advised Nehru that all Congress chief ministers, except a few people, should be designed
 So that state governments can be re-organized
 It was said that leave the post for a few days
 Have to work for the party
 But in Chandrabhanu's eyes, it was that all this game is happening so that the one whom Nehru does not like, he should leave
 They declined
 But they were convinced that it was a matter of a few days
 You will be made Chief Minister again
 But this did not happen
 Under the Kamaraj plan, Chandrabhanu had to step down on the dictum of ideals
 This was a very Democratic war of dictatorship over democracy
 The elected leader had to step down due to dislike
 Chandrabhanu was the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh thrice
 From 1960 to 1963
 But even after leaving the post of Chief Minister, he remained an influence in politics
 a matter of luck
 He again became the Chief Minister after winning the 1967 election
 But this time for only 19 days
 Same luck again
 Farmer leader Chaudhary Charan Singh broke the Congress and formed his party
 Chandrabhanu's government went
 Charan Singh became Chief Minister
 But they could not run the government
 That government also fell
 And Chandrabhanu Gupta was re-appointed as Chief Minister in a hurry in 1969
 He remained in this position for almost a year
 Then something happened that changed the Congress forever
 The Congress party broke up in 1969
 This was not an internal issue of UP
 This time the breakdown took place at the center level
 In a syndicate group led by Indira Gandhi and Kamaraj
 Everyone thought that Indira would be a puppet in her hands
 But Indira turned out to be the biggest politician
 There was a dispute between the two factions about the President
 Morarji Desai turned out to be a strong opponent of Indira
 Chandrabhanu Gupta went to Morarji Camp
 But this camp lost
 VV Giri became President with the support of Indira
 It was here that the career of most of the leaders of the syndicate got a break
 Chandrabhanu's career ended
 But it's a matter of time Morarji also became Prime Minister
 Chandrabhanu was offered a position in the cabinet
 But Chandrabhanu's health had deteriorated
 It was not appropriate to take the post of minister
 They declined
