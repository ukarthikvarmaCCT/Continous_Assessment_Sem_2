 Dadabhai Naoroji was a Parsi intellectual, educationist, cotton merchant and early political and social leader of British India
 unhen 'bharat kaa vayovruddh purush' kaha jaataa he
 From 1892 to 1895 he was a member of the House of Commons in the United Kingdom
 dadabhai nauroji ne bharat main vishvavidhyalayon kii sthapana ke purv ke dinon main elfinston institute main shiksha pai jahaan ke ye medhaavi chaatr the
 He started his life as a teacher in the same institution and later he became a professor of mathematics, which was the highest position in the educational institutions for Indians in those days
 saath main unhone samajasudhar kaaryon main agragami or kai dharmik tathaa sahitya sanghatanon ke, yatha "students litereri and sanitific socity ke, pratishthata ke rup main apana vishesh sthaan banaaya
 It had two branches, a Marathi Gyanprasarak troupe and a Gujarati Gyanprasarak troupe

 He also edited and operated the major paper of social reformers of his time called "rasta Gafftar"
 parsiyon ke itihaas main apni daansheeltaa or prabuddhata ke liye prasiddh "kaimaas' bandhuon ne dadabhai ko apane vyapaar main bhagidaar banane ke liye aamantrit kiya
 Accordingly Dadabhai went to England to establish his office in London and Liverpool
 vidhyalay ke vaataavaran ko chhodkar ekaek vyapaaree dhan janaa ek prakaar kii avnati yaa apwatan samajha ja saktaa he, parantu dada bhai ne is avasar ko england main ucch shiksha ke liye janevaale vidhyaarthiyon kii bhalaai ke liye upyukt samajha
 At the same time, his second objective was to launch a movement for greater Indianisation of government administrative institutions
 jo vidhyaarthee un dinon unke sampark main aae or unase prabhavit hue unamem suprasiddh ferojshah mehta, mohandas karmchand gandhi or mohammad ali jina kaa naam ullekhneey he
 Apart from this, another objective of Dadabhai was also to make the British public aware of the grief of the oppressed Indians from British rule and draw attention to their responsibility to remove them
 un dinon bhartiya civil sevaaon main sammilit hone ke icchhuk abhyarthiyon ke liye sabase kathinaayee kii baat yah thi ki unhen pratikul paristhitiyon main british abhyarthiyon se spardhaa kerani padati thi
 To overcome this inconvenience, Dada Bhai's suggestion was to conduct a civil service examination in England and India simultaneously
 iske liye unhone 1893 tak andolan chalaaya jab ki unhone vahaan loksabhaa main us sadan ke ek sadsy kii haisiyat se adhik sangharsh kiya or sabha ne bharat tathaa england main ek saath pariksha chalaane kaa prastaav sweekaar kar liya
 Other than that in those days, even more serious was the terrible impoverishment of Indians
 haalaanki dadabhai hi pehle vyakti nahin the jinhone iske liye dukh kii abhivyakti kii ho kintu ve pehle vyakti avashya the jinhone uske unmoolan ke liye andolan chalaaya
 He proved with facts and figures that while the Indians were engrossed in poverty, India's administrative service was the most expensive in the world

 After the preliminary survey on the economic condition of Indians, it was concluded that the average annual income of a person in the country was twenty rupees in total
 inhen sab aankadon ke aadhaar par east india association ke saamne unhone "wants and meens aav india' naamak niabandh 27 july 1870 ko padhaa
 By the end of the 19th century, Dadabhai advocated not only before many committees and commissions, but also in front of the British Parliament, to remove the evils committed towards India and keep warning the higher officials equally that if India’s moral and material As the decadence continues, Indians will be forced to boycott not only British goods but also British rule, Ntu it had no effect

 The theory of relativity or relativity, or just relativity, is a fundamental theory of modern physics developed by Albert Einstein and has two major parts - specific relativity and general relativity
 phir bhi kai baar aapekshikta yaa relativity shabd ko gallilian invariens ke sandarbh main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The term, called Theory of Relativity, was first used by Max Planck in 1906
 yah angrezi shabd samooh "relative theory" se liya gaya tha jisamen yah bataaya gaya he ki kaise yah siddhant principal of relativity kaa prayog karata he
 In the discussion section of this paper, Alfred Booker used "theory of Relativity" for the first time
 aapekshikta siddhant sankshep main yah he ki 'nirpeksh' gati tathaa 'nirpeksh' twaran kaa astitv asambhav he, arthath 'nirpeksh gati' evam 'nirpeksh twaran' shabd vastut: nirarthak hai
 If 'absolute motion' had meaning, then it could be certain without referring to other bodies
 parantu sab prakaar se cheshtaa karne par bhi kisi pind kii 'nirpeksh' gati kaa pataa nishchit rup se prayog dwaara pramanit nahin ho sakaa he or ab to aapekshikta siddhant bataata he ki aisa nishchit karnaa asambhav he
 a new approach in physics started with relativity theory
 aapekshikta siddhant ke aane se bhautikee ke katipay puraane siddhanton kaa drudh sthaan dig gaya or anek moulik kalpanaaon ke vishay main sookshm vichaar karne kii aavashyaktaa dikhaai dene lagi
 In science, the function of theory is often to systematically formulate known fruits and then to test new fruits from that theory by experiment
 aapekshikta siddhant in donon kaaryon main safal rahaa he
 By the end of the 19th century, physics was developing according to Newton-inspired theories
 prayek nae avishkaar athwa praayogic fal ko in siddhanton ke drushtikon se dekha jaataa tha or aavashyak nai pariklpanaayen banaai jaati thim
 Among them, the ubiquitous ether had a distinctive place
 ether ke astitv kii kalpana karne ke do pramukh kaaran the
 Firstly, a medium like ether was required for the vibration of electromagnetic waves to propagate from one place to another
 dwitiya, yantriki main newton ke gati vishyak samikarnon ke liye, or jis parshwabhoomi par ye sameekaran aadhaarit the uske liye bhi, ek pramanik nirdeshak kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Specific properties were applied to the ether to accurately assess the fruits of the experiments
 ether sarvyaapee samajha jaataa tha or sampurna dishaao main tathaa pindon main bhi uskaa astitv mana jaataa tha
 In this stable ether, objects could travel without resistance, it was imagined
 in gunon ke kaaran ether ko nirpeksh maanak samajhane main koi baadha nahin thi
 Light speed 3x108 m
 Per second, it was known and waves of light are radiated at this speed relative to 'stationary' ether, it was imagined
 yantriki main veg, twaran, bal ityadi ke liye bhi ether nirpeksh maanak samajha jaataa tha
 In the second half of the 19th century, many attempts were made to experiment with the existence of ether and to establish its properties
 inamen micelsonmorle kaa prayog vishesh mahatvapurn tathaa ullekhneey he
 The purpose of this experiment was to make an accurate measurement of the speed at which the Earth revolves around the Sun with the ether
 kintu yah praytn asafal rahaa or prayog ke fal se yah anumaan nikaala gaya ki ether ke saapeksh prithvi kii gati shunya he
 It also means that the imagery of ether is untrue, that is, ether does not exist
 yadi ether hi nahin he to nirpeksh maanak kaa bhi astitv nahin ho saktaa
 Thus, the motion can only be relative
 bhautikee main saamanyat: gati kaa maapan karne ke liye athwa fal vyakt karne ke liye kisi bhi ek paddati kaa nirdesh dekar kaary kiya jaataa he
 But in these instructional methods, no method can be 'specific', because if it were, then we could consider that 'specific' instructional method as the standard of relaxation
 anek prayogon se aisa hi fal praapt hua
 The fruits of these experiments created serious disturbance not only in physics, but also in science and philosophy

 According to them the laws of physics should be expressed in such a form that they are real to any observer
 iskaa arth yah he ki bhautikee ke niyam prekshak kii gati ke upar avlambit na rahen
 This act sheds new light on the prevailing conceptions of pain and time
 is vishay main oinstin kii vichaardhaara, yadhyapi vah krantikaarak thi, prayogon ke falon ko samajhane main adhik safal rahi
 Einstein made special analysis of the fundamental words and the prevailing conceptions combined with them, such as speed, acceleration, acceleration, time, etc
 is vishleshan se yah spasht hua ki newton ke siddhanton par aadhaarit tathaa pratishthit bhautikee main trutiyaan hai
 Einstein's theory of relativity is two categories: vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is swaroop main vyakt hote hai ki ve kisi bhi atwarit prekshak ke liye samaan honge
 In the general relativity theory, the laws of physics are expressed in such a way that they will be independent or unrestrained by the motion of the observer
 vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1905 main hua or saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1915 main hua
 It was presented by Einstein in 1905 in one of his papers on the electrodynamics of moving bodies
 vishisht saapekshata do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he jo shastreey yantriki ke sankalpanaaon ke viruddh hai: The results from the theory of specific relativity are surprising; Some of these are as follows: shastreey yantriki main galileo kaa roopaantaran prayukt hota he jabaki vishisht saapekshata main lorents roopantaran 
 The theory of relativity developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1911 is known as 'general Relativity'
 yah siddhanth nimnlikhit do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he- Specific relativity theory improved the assumptions made in physics about length, distance, time, mass, energy, etc
 inke atirikt bhautikee ke kshetra main anya vishay hai jo utane hi mahatvapurn hai, kintu unka samavesh vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main nahin he
 The specific relativity principle can be used in force and electromagnetic fields, as it cannot in the gravitational field
 gurutvkarshan bhautikee kaa ek atyant mahatvapurn vibhaag he, at: spasht he ki vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ko vyapak banane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The relation of mass comes in two ways in physics
 kisi pind par jab bal kaary karata he tab pind kaa sthaan badalata he or uskaa veg badalata he
 The body gets acceleration as long as the force acts
 yantriki ke niyamon ke anusaar bal, pind kaa dravyaman or twaran main nimnlikhit sambandh he : The mass m in this equation is called inertia or dependent mass
 dravyaman kaa doosraa sambandh newton ke guruttviya kshetra main aata he
 According to Newton's theory of gravity, if two masses, m1 and m2, are at a distance r, the following gravitational force f will work between them: is sameekaran main g gurutvkarshan sthiraank he
 If we consider m1 as the mass of the earth and m2 as the mass of another body near the earth, the equation will express the mass m2
 newton kii yantriki main gativigyaan tathaa gurutvkarshan swatantra or bhinn hai, kintu donon main hi dravyaman kaa sambandh aata he
 Einstein integrated the concepts used in these two independent and different divisions of the mass into his general relativity theory
 yah gyaat tha ki jadtv par ashrith dravyaman or gurutveey dravyaman samaan hote hai
 Einstein used this analogy of mass to harmonize kinetics and gravity, and in 1915 AD introduced a comprehensive relativity theory
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant ko ganit main sutrit karne kii jo paddati he vah anya paddatiyon se bhinn he
 It uses special geometry, which is different from Euclid's three-dimensional geometry
 ] ne yah bataaya ki yadi vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main dik ke teen aayam tathaa samay kaa chaturth aayam, in chaaron ayaamon ko lekar ek 'chaturaayam satati', kii kalpana kii jaae to aapekshikta siddhant adhik saral ho jaataa he
 Symmetry is not absolute - it has been proved
 isse newton pranit dik tathaa samay kii nirpekshata or swatantraaa samaapt ho jaati he
 Therefore, to express physical phenomena, the quadrant of time and time is more natural
 riman ne 'chaturaayam dik' kii kalpana karke uski jyamiti kaa jo vikaas kiya tha uskaa oinstin ne adhik upyog kiya
 In this quadrant of time and time, the principles of physics were geometrically placed in the general relativity theory
 is chaturaayam satati kaa yuclid ke teen aayam ke dik se samya he
 In the reality of three dimensions, just as a point or a place is determined by these three coordinates, the length between two points and one is also fixed
 chaturaayam satati main dik ke in teen ayaamon ke saath jab samay bhi joda jaataa he tab samay kaa aayam rup t = x0
5c-1 aata he, jahaan t = samay or c = prakaash kaa veg he
 If one observer specifies a world event, then the speed relative to that observer will be the coordinates of the same event for another observer
 lorenz ke roopantaran ke niyam yadi yatharth hon to siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki By developing the equation, similar but highly complex terms are found for any type of motion
 iske liye nishchalon or pradishon ke siddhanton kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Gravity naturally occurs in the wider relativity theory by expanding the original imaginations in this way
 uske liye vishisht pariklpanaaon kii aavashyaktaa nahin haati he
 The results of many events are the same, according to Einstein's pervasive relativity theory and Newton's pioneering mechanics
 kintu khagoliki main jab saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa upyog kiya gaya tab teen ghatnaon ke fal pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar nikle falon se kuch bhinn rahe

 If a rod or tube of a magnetized material is placed in a magnetic field parallel to its length, then its length changes due to molecular rearrangement
 is ghatana ko chumbakeey aakarantar kehete hai
 This research was done by Joule
 lambaai kaa yah parivartan chumbakeey balakshetra kii disha par nirbhar nahin he
 If a ferromagnetic material is placed on an alternating magnetic field, it will vibrate with its natural or overload frequency and produce a parasitic sound
 chumbakeey shithily ke kaaran vidyucchumbakeey urja kaa parashravya urja main parivartan adhik acha nahin hota he
 Also, in this method the ultrasonic sound of maximum frequency cannot be produced because the substance cannot take the shape of a ring
 vincent or peers, donon main chumbakeey acarantar dwaara parashravya kampan paidaa karne ke liye vidyutiya paripath banaae
 This circuit generates automatic excited electrical oscillation, due to the inverse effect of magnetic shaping, as the elongated decrease of the rod length changes the magnetization and the induced electromagnetic force controls the current of the cube through the grid
 is vidhi kaa mukhya laabh isaki saadagi evam sastepan main he tathaa isamen truti he taap par nirbhar rahanaa or aavriti kaa adhik na rahanaa
 Maximum frequency up to 200 khz can be generated by this method

 curi ne bataaya ki yadi samamiti rahit sphatikon yaa crystalon ke kinhin vishesh akshon par dabaav lagaaya jaae to unke do talon par vijaateey vidyudavesh utpann hote hai
 a few days later the same effect was also invented by these two brothers, namely, that it is proved that applying force changes the length of these crystals
 is ghatana ko daab-vidyut-prabhaav kehete hai
 In 1917 AD Langevin stimulated the quartz crystal with an oscillating electric circuit to vibrate at its natural frequency
 yadi vidyut paripath kii aavriti crystal kii aavriti ke baraabar ho, jo crystal anunadit kampan karne lagata he
 The crystal produces a superfluous sound of its natural frequency with amplified frequency and fixed amplitude
 parashravya dhwani utpann karne kii yahi arvachin vidhi he
 In addition to quartz, tourmaline, tartaric acid, rochel salts, barium titanate, etc
 are also used to make oscillators

 In addition to this circuit, other circuits are used to generate ultrasonic sound for various purposes
 crystalon ko kaam main laane se purv vishesh reeti se kaata jaataa he or unako prayog ke liye vishesh reeti se rakhaa jaataa he
 There are mainly four types of introductory sounds of altruistic sound: jab gas madhyam main bilkul halake thos, athwa drav, ke kan chode jate hai tab ve parashravya dhwani ke dwaara apane avasthititv ke anusaar chaalit hote hai
 The study of their motion gives an introduction to the altruistic sound

 The depth of the sea and the distance of other ships are also measured by this method
 5
 vyasaaran evam kalileekaran - parashravya tarangon dwaara ek duusare main pen ghulanevaale dravon kaa paayas ban jaataa he
 Even with the effect of these waves, metals make their emulsion in the fluid
 photography ke kaam main aanevaala chaandi kaa hellide bhi isi vidhi se banataa he
 The effect of these waves breaks down high-molecule molecules and thus starch forms sugars
 parashravya dhwani kii pysikaran kriya kaa upyog acchhee dhaatu banane ke kaam main bhi hota he
 Nitrogen is also injected into iron easily

 us samay samaaj main mahilaayein mukhar nahin thim or na hi mahilaon ko vakaalat kaa adhikaar tha
 But Cornelia was a passion
 apni pratibha kii badaulat unhone mahilaon ko kanoonee paraamarsh dena aarambh kiya or mahilaon ke liye vakaalat kaa pesha kholane kii maang uthaai
 antat: 1907 ke baad carnelia ko bengal, bihar, urisa or assam kii adaalaton main sahaayak mahila vakil kaa pad diya gaya
 In 1924, after a long struggle, the law prohibiting women from advocating was relaxed and opened this profession for them
 1929 main carnelia hoicourt kii varisht vakil ke taur par sevanivrutt huyin par uske baad mahilaon main itani jagriti aa chuki thi ki ve vakaalat ko ek peshey ke taur par apanaakar apni aawaaj mukhar karne lagi thim

 She would later write many of these cases in her work Between the Twilights and two autobiographies
 1924 main, bharat main mahilaon ke liye kanoonee pesha kholaa gaya tha, or sorbaji ne kolkata main abhyaas karnaa shuru kar diya tha

 State-level representations are one of many types of representations of dynamic systems

 Apart from this, it is also useful for analysis and synthesis of non-linear systems and time-varying systems

 The phase field model has two equations - the phase equation and the output equation
 aavriti-kshetra nirupan kii tulana main avasthaa-samshti nirupan ke nimnlikhit laabh hai- The 'state field' or state-space is an imaginary field whose axes are state-variables
 is spes main tantra ke avasthaa charon ko ek vector ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 a system consisting of a p input, q output and n state variables is represented in this method as follows: jahaan called is state vector, and is called output vector, u is called input vector, a is the parent of states, b is the input matrix, c is the output matrix and d uparokt nirupan main sabhi matrix samay ke saath parivarti ho sakate hai kintu yadi tantra raikhik tathaa samay ke saath aparivarti ho to ye matrix aparivarti honge
 The variable time t { \ displaystyle t} can be continuous or discrete
 is sthiti main samay t { \ displaystyle t} ke bajaay praayah char k { \ displaystyle k} kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Tantras that have constant variable and mutually changing components are called hybrid systems
 atah vibhinn sthitiyon main state-spes model kaa rup nimnlikhit prakaar kaa hoga: The state variables of a system are determined by its old states and inputs
 vastutah yadi samyaanterval main purana state x tathaa input u gyaat hon to x ke maan kii gananaa kii ja sakati he: That mechanism is called control, which can be moved from one state to another in a limited time, through acceptable inputs
 koi satat, kaal-aparivarti, raikhik avasthaa-model niyantraneey hoga yadi or keval yadi- Where 'rank' means the number of linearly independent rows of a matrix
 vah tantra 'prekshniya' kehalaata he jiske outputon kaa gyaan hone par uske aantarik avasthaaon kii gananaa kii ja sake
 a continuous, time-invariant, linear state-model will be observable, if and only if- uparokt vivechan kaa saransh yah he ki niyantraniyata kaa arth yah he ki us tantra ko ek avasthaa se duusare avasthaa tak simit samay main le jane ke liye aavashyak input, sambhav he
 Observability means that internal states can be derived if the output of a system is known

 mithila, purvi uttar pradesh evam rajasthan main shaiva sadhana evam shaiva bhav kaa vishesh mahatv rahaa he

 unhone shivshakti yaa rasayanawaad ke sabhi upkarnon ko mukt bhav se sweekaar kiya evam ratansen ko shivanugrah se hi siddhi dilaai
 In the same way, the influence of Shaivism and Nathpanthis is on the knowledgeable saints like Kabir
 unhone niranjan yaa shunya ko shivaroop main hi grahan kiya
 Mahakavi Tulsidas composed several verses full of devotion to Shiva in 'vinayapatrika' and in the independent text like 'parvatimangal', for the first time, the legend of Shiva married was given a management form in the lingua franca
 unke 'ramcharitamanas' ke aarambh main hi shivakatha kahi gai he
 In the middle too there is the famous Shivastuti and by presenting it as shiva-uma-samvad Tulsi has provided the Shaivite ambience to Ramakatha
 surdaas ne bhi sursagar main antarktha ke rup main shivajivan ke anek prasangon ko geetiprabandh kaa rup dekar prastut kiya he

 has been given to the human being, the message of building Shiva society
 yugin bhaawanaaon evam rashtriya parivesh ke aavaran main shiv ko tandav, kranti or vidhwans kaa pratik maanakar kavy rachnewaalon main kaviver aarasi, kedarnath mishra 'prabhaat' nathuram 'shankar', ramkumar verma, ramdhaari singh 'dinakar' evam sumitranandan pant pramukh hai

 In today's scientific age, no country can live separately
 in deshon main parsparik sambandh jodna aaj ke yug main aavashyak ho gaya he
 Qualified individuals are sent from one country to another to connect these relations
 ye vyakti apni yogyata, kushalta or kootneeti se duusare desh ko praayah mitra bana lete hai
 Even in ancient times, one state used to send its diplomats to connect diplomatic relations with another state
 pehle kootneeti kaa arth 'saude main yaa len dein main vaakya chaaturi, chal-prapanch, dhokhaa-dhadi' lagaaya jaataa tha
 a person who used to get maximum benefits for his country by paying a lower price was called a skilled diplomat
 parantu aaj chal-prapanch ko kootneeti nahin kaha jaataa he
 Scientifically, in modern times the term is used for peaceful settlement in two states
 diplomasi ke liye hindi main kootneeti ke sthaan par rajnay shabd kaa prayog hone laga he
 The international world has become like a family
 parivaar ke sadasyon main prem, sahyog, sadbhaavna tathaa mitrataa kaa sambandh jodna ek kushal rajanyajna kaa kaam he
 The word 'rajnay' is a Hindi translation of the English word 'diplomacy'
 diplomasi shabd kii utpatti greek bhashaa ke diploun shabd se hui he jiskaa arth modana athwa doharaa karnaa he
 The Roman Empire developed after the fall of the Greek states
 roman samrajya main passport evam sadakon par chalane ke anumati patr aadi dohare karke sil diye jate the
 These passports and permission cards were inscribed on metal letters
 inako 'diploma' kaha jaataa tha
 Gradually, the term diploma was used for all government papers
 videshiyon ke visheshadhikaar athwa unmukti evam videshi sandhiyon sambandhi kagajaat bhi 'diploma' kahe jane lage
 When the number of these treaties became more, they were kept in safe places
 ye sthaan baad main 'rajkeey abhilekhagaaron' ke naam se jane gayi
 As the number of diplomats of the coronation offices increased, they were recruited and separately appointed to look after them and take care of them
 in karmchaariyon kaa kaary rajanyik krity kaha gaya
 Gradually, the term diplomacy started being used for this business
 rajnay shabd kaa prayog vichaarkon dwaara anek arthon main kiya gaya he
 According to Herald Nicholson, it is sometimes used as a synonym for foreign policy, such as Indian diplomacy was not successful in neighboring countries
 kabhi is shabd dwaara sandhi vaarta ko ingit kiya jaataa he, jaise is samasya ko rajnay dwaara suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 The diplomatic treaty also indicates the process and mechanism of negotiation
 kabhi-kabhi videsh seva kii ek shakha ko rajnay kah diya jaataa he
 Diplomacy is also considered to be the intangible quality or skill of negotiating an international treaty
 iskaa sabase dooshit prayog vah he jab ise ek kapattapurna kaary arth main liya jaataa he
 Thus, due to the use of the word diplomacy in various meanings, it creates confusion in the mind of the reader
 shaayad raajnneeti shaastra main yah shabd sabase adhik bhram utpann karne vaala he
 In this subject, Argensky has said that qualities like 'skill, cleverness and deceit' can be signs of good diplomacy, but they cannot be called characteristics that define diplomacy
 rajnay videsh niti ke samakaksh bhi nahin
 It is such a part of foreign policy that contributes actively to its creation and implementation
 ' According to Argensky- sar arnest santon ke anusaar, In this regard, Palmer and Perkins have expressed a curiosity that if there is a lack of intelligence and tact in the mutual relations of states, would diplomacy be impossible? It is clear that diplomacy is a relationship between two or more independent states, accordingly each state uses intelligence, skill and tact
 ke0em0 panikkar ke shabdon main, Quincy Wright has defined diplomacy in two ways - in the popular sense and in the special sense
 lokapriy arth main - The special point of this definition is that diplomacy in the popular sense has been considered a treaty that is based on persuasion rather than pressure
 iske vishesh arth main rajanyagnon ko rashtriya hit ke prati bhakthipurna mana gaya he
 Popular meaning of diplomacy does not apply in political science
 anterrashtriya sambandhon main rajnay keval vahi kaary karata he jahaan dabaav kii sambhaavnaayen rahati hai
 These possibilities are suppressed by diplomacy
 rajnay kaa uddeshy samjhaute karnaa he or samjhaute keval vahiin kiye jate hai jahaan kuch asahmatiyaan hon
 These disagreements should be such that negotiations can be agreed
 purna sahmati ke kshetron main rajnay apraasangik he tathaa purna asahmati ke kshetron main yah prabhaavaheen he
 According to Roberto Regella, the word diplomacy has been misused
 asal main rajnay ek aisa vyavsaay he jisamen anek kriyaayen shaamil ho jaati hai
 It is one of the few professions in the world that covers every branch of human activity in its periphery
 iskaa sambandh shakti raajnneeti aarthik shakti evam vichaardhaaraon ke sangharsh se he
 Regella considers diplomacy to be the 'art of negotiation'
 1796 main edmand bark ne rajnay kii paribhaasha dete hue likhaa tha ki rajnay anterrashtriya sambandhon kaa parichaalan athwa sanchaalan he
 George F
 Cannon states that in the technical sense diplomacy can be arranged as a link between governments
 is prakaar vibhinn vichaarkon ne rajnay kii vibhinn paribhaashayen di hai
 All these definitions are not entirely appropriate as the meaning of diplomacy changes as time and circumstances change
 anek vichaarkon ne rajnay ko keval ek vyavsaay hi nahin varan ek kala bhi mana he
 Most governments have started adopting it for the attainment and growth of their interests
 yah dhire-dhire shaanti kaa ek prabhaavshaalee saadhan banataa ja rahaa he
 Initially the states were full of unlimited powers and as a result, diplomats were considered sovereign
 unhen kaary karne kii paryaapt swatantraaa saunpi jaati thi
 Another reason for this freedom was that there was a lack of rapid means of communication at that time
 19veen shatabdi ke uttararddh main rajanyikon kii yah vyapak swatantraaa simit hone lagi
 Another feature of diplomacy at that time was also that diplomats were sent only by giving orders and instructions related to their work
 aajkal sanchaar ke tivrgami sadhano kii suvidha ke kaaran yah aavashyak nahin rahaa he
 Some people consider diplomacy to be a mysterious business
 yah sahi nahin he
 According to Hudh Gibson, "in fact, diplomacy is an illusionary business
 yah jaadu athwa rahasy se pare he
 It can be seen as a serious business like any other government function
 paamar tathaa parickens ne rajnay kii kuch visheshtaon kaa varnan kiya he
 These features will prove useful to explain the nature of diplomacy
 ye visheshtayen nimnlikhit hai :- Nicholson is not right to say that diplomatic work ceases when the war begins, as Palmer and Perkins think diplomats work to protect the country
 atah yuddh ke samay haath par haath dhar kar nahin baithte hai, balki us samay ve sainik kaaryon main sahyog dete hai
 In this way, the work of diplomats does not stop during the war, but the form of their work changes
 yuddh kaal main rajnay kaa kaary adhik bad jaataa he
 This is clear from the observation of the events of the last two World Wars
 rajnay kaa swaroop samajhane ke liye yah upyogi he ki videsh niti, anterrashtriya kanoon evam rajanyik raajnneeti se uske sambandh tathaa antar kaa adhyayan kiya jaye
 Dynasties and states of ancient India have a long tradition of diplomacy
