saharsa jile ke antargat 2 anumandal evam 10 prakhand hai
 a unique village located in the holy city of Kandaha, Punyamayi Dharadham, situated between Koshi and Dharmamula river, is a unique saga of the unique suriyurthi of the whole world, which is Dwapar Yugin
 The first name of Kandaha village, which preserved this ancient heritage, was Kandarpadaha, which literally means Kandarpa where the combustion took place
 According to the Puranas, Kamdev was burnt by Shri Shivji on the land of this Kandaha, hence the name of this place was Kandarpadaha which eventually turned into Kandaha
 murtiparichay:- The sun sign of Kandaha is the first sign of Aries, the proof of which is the sign of Aries on the sign
 The five-foot Suryamurthi sits on a chariot of seven horses in an eight-foot chariot with both its wives, nouns and shadows, which have been variously named in various elders, which are chased by the charioteer Arun, with hi in the left
 The Samvatsara Chakra also exists
 Bhagavan Surya has two hands, in which the lotus flower is visible, in which the left hand was broken by Mughal terrorists
 The amazing artwork of Simhashan is made on sight
 In the right part of Suryamurthi, there is the octagon Ganesha and Shivling in the left part and Sri Suryayantra in front
 The artwork and script engraved on the doorway at the entrance to the sanctum sanctorum is also unmatched in itself
 But unfortunately all the idols have been damaged by the Mughals
 sthapana:- According to the Puranas, in the Dwapar Yuga, Sambativa, the son of Jambavati, the patrani of Sri Krishna, was beautiful, by whom Maharishi Durvasha who came to meet Shri Krishna was despised and the angry Maharishi Durvasha cursed Samb to be cured of leprosy
 Now the entire Yaduvanshi Families got upset
 With the help of Narada, when he was asked, he asked Samb to meditate on the Sun and after that samb ne mithravan main chandrabhaga nadi ke kinare surya kaa kathor taap kiya or jiske falswaroop bhagavan surya prasann hokar unhen rogamukt kar die| rogamukt karne ke saath hi bhagavan bhaskar ne samb ko barhon raashi main suryamurti kii sthapana kaa aadesh bhi diya | isi kram main pratham mesh raashi ke surya kii sthapana hetu tatkaaleen jyotishiyon kii gananaa ke dwaara shri shivaji kii tapasthali isi kandaha gaanv kaa chayan hua or dwapar yug main shrikrishna putr samb ke dwaara kandaha main pratham raashi mesh ke surya kii sthapana hui or rishi muniyon dwaara ugantar se inaki puja hoti aa rahi he | In this sequence, the Maharaja bathed and consumed the rich medicinal properties of the sun-well located in the courtyard of Suryamandir, which made the Maharaja fully healthy and after receiving the worthy two sons Narasimhadeva and Hari Singhdev, was very delighted and the renovated and sculpted temple
 Was restored and named Bhavaditya Surya after adding his name to Lord Aditya and since then In Kandha name Ry God began to sun worship | Kandaha village is 12 km west of Saharsa headquarters, three km north of Satwar Chowk, connected by a paved road where thousands of devotees visit and worship Lord Bhaskar and get the desired fruit
 According to Mahabharata and Surya Purana, this Sun Temple was constructed in the 'dwapara Yuga'
 puranic manyata ke anusaar bhagwaan krishna ke putr 'shamb' kisi twachaa rog se peedit the jo maatr yahan ke surya coop ke jal se thik ho sakati thi
 This holy sun well is still located near the temple
 is ke pavitra jal se abhi bhi twachaa rogon ke thik hone kii baat bataai jaati he
 This Sun Temple is also considered amazing due to the idol of Sun God
 mandir ke garbh grih main surya dev vishaal pratimaa he, jise is ilaake main ' baba bhavaditya' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The statue depicts 'sangya' and 'kalh', both wives of the Sun God
 saath hi 7 ghode or 14 lagaam ke rath ko bhi darshaya gaya he
 a great feature of this statue is that it is made of very soft black stone
 yah visheshta to konark evam dev ke surya mandiron main bhi dekhne ko nahin milti
 But the most amazing and mysterious is the script engraved on the doorpost of the temple which has not yet been read
 parantu durbhaagya se is pratimaa ko bhi aurangzeb kaal main anya anek hindu mandiron kii tarah hi kshatigrast kar diya gaya
 For this reason, the left hand, nose and thread of the statue are not properly detected
 is pratimaa ke anya anek bhaagon ko bhi aurangzeb kaal main hi todakar nikat ke surya coop main phenk diya gaya tha, jo 1985 main surya coop kii khudaai ke baad mili hai
 After 1985, this temple came under the Archaeological Survey of India Department
 puraatatv vibhaag ne mandir kii dekh rekh ke liye ek karmchaaree ko niyukt kar rakhaa he
 But the government has neglected the restoration and development of this temple
 vah to yahan ke kuch graminon kii jaagrukta evam sahyog ke kaaran mandir apane vartmaan swarup main maujuud he
 The cooperation of many villagers including Nunu Jha and Jayaprakash Verma has been commendable
 is mandir ko bihar sarkaar ke taraf se pratham sahyog tab mila jab ashok kumaar singh paryaton mantri bane
 He gave a grant of Rs 3 xxrep 5 0 in 2003 for the development of this temple
 parantu yah rakam mandir ke vikaas ke liye prayaapt nahin thi
 Nevertheless the temple complex was repaired with this amount
 saath hi mukhya dwaar kaa nirmaan ho sakaa
 But there is still much to be done for this temple and this backward village, so that this amazing temple can be counted as the main tourist destination of Bihar

} Basa village is situated on the banks of river Baner with a town called Haripur! It was settled in 1400 by Raja Harichand, who founded the town named Haripur, where the king settled the people of Harait, due to which the name of this village was settled and Haripur, which was once known as Chhoti Kashi
 Because there used to be most wells and temples in this town! Which has been broken to a great extent! Here the fort built by King Harichand in 1405, Lord Krishna's Govardhandhari temple, Lord Ram's temple, Mata Daman Doshi's temple and many other temples still stand with the same glory! There is also a playground in this town, which is called Chaugan, according to the legend, once the horses of the king used to graze grass in this field! Along with village Basa, there is a town called Guler in which great Chandra Dhar Sharma has been a great poet like Guleri
 sanskrit aalochana ke anek abhidhaanon main alankarishastra hi nitant lokapriy abhidhaan he
 Among its ancient names, activity is the second of the 64 arts referred to by Vatsyayana
 rajasekhar dwaara ullikhit "sahitya vidya" namakaran kavy kii bhartiya kalpana ke upar ashrith he, parantu ye namakaran prasiddh nahin ho sake
 The use of the word ornament in "ornamentation" should be understood in both a broad and narrow sense
 alankaar ke do arth maanya hai - On accepting the wider meaning, the ornamentation is a vizhastra of all the elements of Kavashobha - qualities, rituals, rasa, vritti sound etc
 - in which a detailed description of the nature and importance of these elements is presented
 sankeern arth main grahan karne par yah naam apane aitihaasik mahatv ko abhivyakt karata he
 In the early era of literature, "ornamentation" was considered to be the supreme being of poetry, in the absence of which poetry is lifeless and lifeless like heatless fire
 "alankaar" ke gambhir vishleshan se ek ore "vakrokti" kaa tatv udbhoot hua or duusari ore arth kii samiksha karne par "dhwani" ke siddhant kaa spasht sanket mila
 Therefore, despite being an exponent of poetic elements like rasa, sound, quality, etc
, due to the ornamental predominant vision, criticism was named "ornamentation" and became popular
 alankaaron kii, visheshat: upama, roopak, swaabhaavokti tathaa atishyokti kii, uplabdhi rugveda ke mantron main nishchit rup se hoti he, parantu vaidic yug main is shaastra ke aavirbhaav kaa pramaan nahin miltaa
 Literary analysis of "upma" from Nirukta's practice appears to be the culmination of criticism from Yasak from the earlier era
 yask ne kisi pracheen acharya ke upmalakshan kaa nirdesh hi nahin kiya he, pratyut karmopama, bhutopama, roopopama, siddhopama, arthopama jaise moulik upama-prakaaron kaa bhi drushtaantpur:sar varnan kiya he 
 It is clear from this that the rise of the ornament had preceded Yask
 kaashyap tathaa vararuchi, brahmadatt tathaa nandiswami ke naam tarunvachaspati ne aadya alankarikon main avashya liye hai parantu inke granth or mat kaa parichay nahin miltaa
 Only the "natyashastra" of Bharata is available nowadays among the Ashtadash Acharyas of Jupiter, Upamanyu, Suvarnabha, Prachatayana, Shesha, Pulastya, Parashar, Utthya etc
 referred to in "kavmimamsa" by Rajasekhar
 anya acharya keval kaalpanik satta dhaaran karte hai
 This much is certain that the rise of Greek criticism centuries before "ornamentation" had become recognized as authentic scripture
 "alankarisarvasv" ke tikaakar samudrbandh ne is shaastra ke anek sampradaayon kii vishistataa kii sundar vivaran prastut kiya he
 Different sects originated in different centuries by giving importance and emphasis to different parts of poetry
 mukhya sampradaayon kii sankhya chah maani ja sakati he- According to their names, these sects have accepted Tattatta, the soul of poetry
 ras sampradaay ke ke mukhya acharya bharat muni hai jinhone nateras kaa hi mukhyat: vishleshan kiya or us vivaran ko avaantar aacharyon ne kavyras ke liye bhi pramanik mana
 The principal Acharyas of the Alankara sect are Bhamah, Dandi, Udbhat and Rudrat
 is mat main alankaar hi kavy kii aatma mana jaataa he
 This sect is adopted as the oldest and most influential in the history of this scripture
 reeti sampradaay ke pramukh acharya vaaman hai jinhone apane "kaavyalankarsutra" main reeti ko spasht shabdon main kavy kii aatma mana he 
 Dandi also gave a great poignant review of the common types of rituals - Vaidarbhi and Gaudi - in his "kavyadarsha", but in his view, poetry has a predominance of ornamentation
 vakrokti sampradaay kii udbhaavna kaa shrey acharya kuntak ko he jinhone apane "vakroktijivit" main "vakrokti" ko kavy kii aatma sweekaar kiya he
 Anandavardhan inaugurated the sound community in his epochal treatise "dhwanyalok" and was founded by Abhinav Gupta in the Lochan Tika of Dhwanyalok
 mammat, ruyyak, hemchandra, piyushvarsh jayadev, vishwanath kaviraj, panditraj jagannatha --isi sampradaay ke pratishthit acharya hai
 Kshemendra, the eminence of the justification sect, adopted the opinion of the ancient masters like Bharata, Anandavardhana etc
 and adopted the justification element as a major element in poetry and distinguished it as an independent sect
 alankarishastra is prakaar lagbhag do sahasr varshon se kavyatatvon kii samiksha karata aa rahaa he
 This scripture has been guiding critics and poets in reviewing poetry and writing poetry since very ancient times
 yah kavy ke antarang or bahirang donon kaa vishleshan badi maarmikata se prastut karata he
 For the reviewers, there are four very important accounts of the poetry of Alankasastra, which have been carefully interpreted, intimate examination and practical use by Indian literary mystics with many nuances
 ye mahneey kavy tatv hai--auchity, vakrokti, dhwani tathaa ras
 The element of justification is the most widespread theory in folk practice and in poetry
 auchity ke aadhaar par hi rasamimasaa kaa prasaad khadaa hota he
 This quote from Anandavardhana epitomizes the fundamental fact in the review that there is no other reason for rashes except impropriety, and the appropriation of justification is the secret of the rasa - vakrokti lokatikrant gochar vachan ke vinyas kii saahitiyik sangya he
 Any utterance results in the juxtaposition of curvature as a juxtaposition of poetry
 europe main kroche dwaara nirdisht "abhivyanjanawad" vakrokti ko bahut kuch sparsh karanevaala kavyatatv he
 The element of sound is the third major component of Sanskrit criticism
 hamaare aalochakon kaa kahana he ki kavy utana hi nahin prakat karata jitna hamaare kaanon ko prathit hota he, pratyut vah nitant gudh arthon ko bhi hamaare hriday tak pahunchaane kii kshamta rakhata he
 This beautiful captivating meaning is manifested by a specific vocabulary called "vyānjana" and thus the expression is called by the word acoustic
 saubhaahgya kii baat he ki angreji ke maanya aalochak abrcrambi tathaa richards kii drushti is tatv kii ore abhi-abhi aakrisht hui he
 The metaphysics of statehood is the captivating fruit of the psychological review of Indian critics
 kavy alokik anand ke unmilan main hi charitaarth hota he chaahe vah kavy shravy ho yaa drishy
 The heart of the poem is the poignant and graceful aspect of poetry rather than the aesthetic, the Indian criticism is absolutely insistent on this fact
 bhartiya aalochana jivan kii samasya ko sulajhane vaale darshan kii chaanbin se kathampi paranmukh nahin hoti or is prakaar yah paashchaatya jagat ke teen shastron-- "poetics", "retariks" tathaa "asthetics"- kaa pratinidhitiv akele hi apane aap karti he
 In antiquity, seriousness and psychological analysis, it is more important than Western criticism; There can be no two opinions about this

 However, he demands to spend the night with the young Shabnam, who recently joined the brothel as a psychic after being abused
 begum ko raat main anand lene ke liye kaha jaataa he, jabaki vah apni raat kaa anand uthaate hai
 He is forced to oblige begum jaan or uske band ko ek maheene kaa notice dene ke baavjood unhen chhodane ke kai asafal prayaason ke baad, hari or eliyas, ek hataash aakhri resort ke rup main, sonpur main ek kukhyat hatyare kabir kii sahaayta ke liye, use dhamkee dene ke liye uske sadasyon ko veshyalay khaali karne ke liye raja saab ek din veshyalay main waapas laute, begum jaan ko yah suchit karne ke liye ki unke prayaas vifal rahe hai or ab unhen veshyalay khaali karnaa hoga
 Begum, who was expecting, was shocked in despair

 As a result of Kabir's threatening tactics, Begum asks Salim to train each girl to use weapons and fight back
 gahan prashikshan abhyaas satr yojit kiye jate hai
 Meanwhile, Mastrji, Ladli's teacher, is in love with Begum Jaan and, in her proposal, unaware that another prostitute named Gulaba, is also hesitant about feelings for her, Begum Jaan rejects her offer and abandons her
 Asked, planning to kill him with the help of a cruel master

 Gulaba does so, but Mastrji leaves him and lets him be raped by his partner in a horse carriage

 However, he was shot shortly thereafter

 Begum Jaan and her girls fought a certain battle

 The following sequence of numbers in mathematics is called Hemachandra series or Fibonacci series: paribhaasha ke anusaar, pehali do hemchandra sankhyaayein 0 or 1 hai
 Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers
 kuch log aarambhik 0 ko chhod dete hai, jisaki jagah do 1 ke saath anukram kii shuruuaat kii jaati he
 In mathematical terms, the f n sequence of Fibonacci numbers can be represented by the rotation relation- tathaa, The Fibonacci sequence is named after Leonardo Fibonacci of Pisa, who was known as Fibonacci
 fibonachi dwaara likhit 1202 kii pustak liber abek ne pashchim europea ganit main is anukram ko pravartit kiya, haalanki pehle hi bhartiya ganit main is anukram kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 The Fibonacci sequence was very well known in ancient India, where it was applied to versification science long before it became prevalent in Europe
 iske vikaas kaa shrey pingala, virahanka, gopal, tathaa hemchandra ko diya jaataa he
 The Fibonacci sequence is prepared by adding s to a sample of n - 1 length, or by adding l to a sample of n - 2 length; And the scribes showed that samples of n length are the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence

 In the west, Leonardo of Pisa studied this sequence known as Fibonacci in his Liber Abaci
 unhone ek adarsh khargosh kii aabaadi ke vikaas par yah maanate hue vichaar kiya ki: Its rule is that one pair of rabbits produces 2 pairs in its lifetime and dies
 maan len ki n maheene main aabaadi f he
 At this time, only those rabbits, which survived at n - 2 months, are fertile and produce offspring, so f pairs are added to the existing population F
 is prakaar kul he f = f + f 
 The first 21 Fibonacci numbers also reported as Fn for n = 0, 1, 2, 


, 20 are: aavartan sambandh kaa prayog karte hue, anukram rinatmak suchakank n tak bhi badhaayaa ja saktaa he

 darasal, fibonachi anukram suspasht vibhajyata gun ko santusht karata he
 Like every sequence defined by linear rotation, the Fibonacci number has a whole-formula solution
 It is known as the Binet Sutra, although he was previously known as Abraham de Moivre: 
 Fibonacci Repatriation svarnim anupaat ke nirdharak sameekaran ke samaan nimnatah he Which is known as the productive polynomial of alternation
 uparyukt sameekaran kaa koi mul x 2 = x + 1, { \ displaystyle { \ begin{matrix}x^{2}=x+1, \ end{matrix}} \ ,} kaa samaadhaan karata he or x n − 1 { \ displaystyle x^{n-1} \ ,} dwaara guna karne se nimna darshata he: By definition φ { \ displaystyle \ varphi \ ,}, is the root of the equation and the second root is 1 - φ = - 1 / φ
 { \ displaystyle 1- \ varphi \ , = - 1 / \ varphi \ ,
}
 So: or Both φ n { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^ {n}} and n = n { \ displaystyle ^ {n} = ^ {n}} are geometric series that solve the Fibonacci alternation
 The first series expands exponentially; The second, exponentially, with alternating signs, leads to zero
 Since the Fibonacci alternation is linear, any linear combination of these two series can also solve the alternation
 These linear combinations create a two-dimensional linear vector difference; The original Fibonacci sequence can be found in this difference
 raikhik sanyojanon kii shrinkhlaayein φ n { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^{n}} or n { \ displaystyle ^{n}}, a tathaa b gunankon sahit, nimna dwaara paribhaashit kii ja sakati hai All the series defined in this way satisfy the Fibonacci alternation
 jahaan apeksha he ki f a, b = 0 { \ displaystyle F_{a,b}=0} or f a, b = 1 { \ displaystyle F_{a,b}=1} pratifal a = 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle a=1 / { \ sqrt {5}}} or b = − 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle b=-1 / { \ sqrt {5}}} dete hai, jiske parinamswaroop vahi binet sutara miltaa he, jisase hamane shuru kiya tha
 yah darshaya gaya he ki yah sutara fibonachi prayaavartan kii purti karata he
 iske alaava, ek suspasht jaanch kii ja sakati he: And aagaman ke mul prashnon siddh karte hue, pramanit karte hai ki Therefore, for any two initial values, the combination a, b { \ displaystyle a, b} can be found such that the functions f a, b { \ displaystyle F_ {a, b} \ ,}, are accurate to the sequence
 Complete formula
 chunki sabhi n ≥ 0 { \ displaystyle n \ geq 0} ke liye | 1 − φ | n / 5 = 0 { \ displaystyle k>=0} purnankon ke liye paaya jaataa he opposite of this, kabhi-kabhi vyutkram fibonachi sankhya par purnank yogafal kaa theta falan ke sandarbh main maan nikaala ja saktaa he

 fibonachi abhajya sankhya, ek aisi fibonachi sankhya he, jo abhajya he
 pehle kuch hai: Fibonacci prime numbers have been found with thousands of digits, but it is not known if there are many infinite numbers
 They all must have a prime exponent, except f 4 = 3
 f kn ko f n se vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he or isliye manamaane dhang se kai sanyukt sankhya prachlan main hone ke kaaran, sanyukt fibonachi sankhya bhi manamaane dhang se prachlan main hai
 Each Fibonacci number with the exception of 1, 8 and 144 has a prime multiplier, which is not a multiple of a smaller Fibonacci number
 keval 144 nagnetar varg fibonachi sankhya he

 Any Fibonacci number greater than f 6 = 8 is neither one more or one less than the prime number
 koi kramik teen fibonachi sankhya, ek samay main do ko lete hue, anupatik abhajya sankhya rahi hai: arthath, And generally, fibonachi sankhyaon kii abhajya p dwaara vibhajyata lijendre sanket se sambandhit he { \ displaystyle \ ; \ left} jiskaa nimnatah maan nikaala jaataa he: If p is a prime number, then f p ≡ and f p - ≡ 0

} udhaaharan ke liye, It is not known whether there exists a prime p such that f p - ≡ 0 { \ displaystyle F_ {p- \ left} \ equiv 0 { \ pmod {p ^ {2 xxrep 4 } such prime numbers are referred to as wal- Sun number will be called prime number
 iske alaava, agar p ≠ 5 ek visham abhajya sankhya he, to: Examples of all cases: visham n ke liye, f n ke sabhi visham abhajya bhaajak hai ≡ 1, jo yah suchit karte hai ki f n ke sabhi visham bhaajak hai ≡ 1 
 for example, f 1 = 1, f 3 = 2, f 5 = 5, f 7 = 13, f 9 = 34 = 2×17, f 11 = 89, f 13 = 233, f 15 = 610 = 2×5×61 ∑ k = nn + 9 f k = 11 f n + 6 { \ displaystyle \ sum _ {k = n} ^ {n + 9} F_ {k} = 11F_ {n + 6}} udhaaharan ke liye, let n = 1: f 1 + f 2 + 


 + f 10 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 = 143 = 11 × 13n = 2: F2 + F3 + 


 + F11 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 + 89 = 231 = 11 × 21n = 3: F3 + F4 + 


 + F12 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 + 89 + 144 = 374 = 11 × 34 vastutah, samaanika na keval dhanatmak, balki sabhi n purnankon ke liye sahi he: n = 0: F0+F1+


+F9 = 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 = 88 = 11×8n = −1: f − 1 + F0 + 


 + F8 = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 = 55 = 11 × 5n = −2: F−2+F−1+F0+


+F7 = −1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 = 33 = 11×3 It can be easily seen that if the units of the Fibonacci sequence take mod n, then the resulting sequence with at most n 2 rotations must be iterative
 Various n formulas, the extension of frequencies for the so-called Pisano rotation
 The determination of Pisano frequencies in general is an open problem, although for a particular n it can be solved as an example of cycle detection

 The sides of the first triangle in this sequence are 5, 4 and 3 in length
 Leaving 8, the sides of the next triangle are 13, 12 and 5 in length
 Leaving 21, the sides of the next triangle are 34, 30 and 16 in length
 This sequence continues indefinitely
 The sides of the triangle a, b, c can be calculated directly: ye sutara sabhi n ke liye a n 2 = b n 2 + c n 2 { \ displaystyle a_{n}^{2}=b_{n}^{2}+c_{n}^{2}} ko hal karte hai, lekin ve keval trikon kii bhujaaon kaa nirupan karte hai, jab n > 2 { \ displaystyle n>2} ho
 To generate the Pathagorean triplets in a different way, any four consecutive Fibonacci numbers f n, f n +1, f n +2 and f n +3 can also be used

 The Fibonacci sequences, in two successive Fibonacci numbers, appear in biological scenes, such as branches in trees, arrangement of leaves on the stalk, pineapple pods, a folded fern artichoke flower, and arrangement of cedar cones
 In addition, many popular sources of nature claim claims related to Fibonacci numbers or gold segments, such as breeding of rabbits, spiral circles of mussels and the curve of waves
 Fibonacci numbers are also found in the bee family tree

 Fibonacci numbers also appear in the reproduction description of a population of ideally spotted bees, according to the following rules: is prakaar, nar makkhi ke hameshaa ek janak honge or maadaa makkhi ke do
 If one discovers the evolution of the offspring of a male bee, then it will have 1 female parent
 a female will have 2 parents, a female and a male
 The female will have two parents, one male and one female and one male female
 Those two females each had two parents and one male

 ko paidaa hue the
 The city of Königuzburg is in Russia today and is now Kaliningrad Kaliningrad
 uski praarambhik shiksha apni mata kii dekharekh main hui thi, jo apane samay ke "pavitra maarg" naamak dharmik andolan se bahut prabhavit thi
 Therefore, at an early age, he was interested in righteous conduct, simple, well-organized and professional life
 16 varsh kii aayu main, "collegium fidericaanum" kii shiksha samaapt kar, vah konigsburg ke vishvavidhyalay main pravisht hua, jahaan chah varsh usne bhautikashastra, ganit, darshan evam dharamshastra kaa adhyayan kiya
 For nine years after leaving university, Kant moved to a village called Judskin, 60 miles from Königsberg
 vahaan vah do teen pariwaron main adhyaapan kaary kar apni jeevika chalaata or bhautikashastra tathaa darshan main swadhyay karata rahaa
 In the meantime, many of his articles and epics were published, two of which are "special Considerations on the Approximation of Living Powers" and "general Natural History and Theory of the Akash"

 He had also submitted the necessary arrangements for the degree of "doctor's Legacy" in 1755 AD and the University of Königsberg certified his qualification by granting him the said degree
 kintu uski vyaktigat samasyaon main koi parivartan na hua
 Pleased with his nine years of hard work, the university had appointed him a distinguished lecturer, but he did not get paid for this work
 kaant ne, visham paristhitiyon ke baavjood, 1766 i
 tak vishvavidhyalay kii avaitnaik rup se seva kii
 In 1758 AD, he prayed for the post of chief teacher of logic and philosophy, but he failed
 1766 i
 main use adhyaapan ke saath-saath sahaayak pustkaalay prabandhak bhi niyukt kiya gaya or ab use das pound vaarshik vetan milane laga
 For four years, Kant also worked in this form, but he continued to study, think and write
 "privet dogent" niyukt hone ke baad se 1770i tak uske paanch prakaran granth prakashit hue– The titles of the above texts suggest that the time between 1755 and 1770 AD was the creation of Kant's ideas
 san 1770 i
 main prakashit laathini sthapanaalekh –"sansar kii samaj or buddhi ke aakaar evam siddhant" se uskaa chintan vyavasthit rup main viksit hota dikhaai detaa he
 In the same year, he was appointed to the same teacher of logic and philosophy at the University of Königsberg, for which he had to be disappointed 12 years ago
 pehle se ab vah chintamukt bhi ho gaya tha kyonki use 60 pound vaarshik vetan milane laga tha
 In those days, such salaries were paid only to respectable teachers
 granthon ke prakaashan se bhi koi badi dhanrashi nahin praapt hoti thi
 Kant earned only 30 pounds from his "critique of Pure Reason"
 kintu, bhautik sukhon kii aakanksha na kar, 1796 i
 tak vah sakriy rup se sansar ke gyaanakosh kii abhivruddhi ke nimitt praytn karata rahaa
 Out of these 26 years, Adi spent 12 years writing only one book "review of Pure Wisdom"
 ukt granth 1781 i
 main prakashit hua tha
 It is considered the best philosophical treatise in Kant's adult texts
 is kaal ke anya granth "prayek bhavi darshan kii bhoomika", "nitidarshan kii prishthbhumi", "prakritik vigyaan ke darshanik aadhaar", "vyaavhaarik buddhi kii samiksha", "nirnay kii samiksha", "keval buddhi dwaara simit dharm", tathaa "shaashvat shanti par" 
 Even after 1796 AD, he was busy studying, thinking and writing, but these eight years of his life were spent in a very pathetic condition
 uski smriti itani ksheen ho gai thi ki use choti-moti baaten bhi likhakar yaad rakhni padati thim
 He did not have the power to take care of his own house; He did not marry, but during the teaching period of 42 years, he made a good impression on his colleagues and students
 atev mitron evam shishyon se use apane jivan ke antim bhaag main kaaphi sahaayta evam sahanubhuti praapt hui
 After 1801 AD, he became very infirm, but in the last three years his disciple named Wesianski stayed together and cared for him
 aashcharya kii baat he ki is kaal ke likhe hue kaant ke saat granth uplabdh hai– "ethics", "naitik gun ke siddhant ke darshanik aadhaar", "the contradiction of the psyche powers, "vyaavhaarik drushti se nrishastra", "logic," Physical Geography "and" Pedagogy "

 There were also rules for snack time

 Yet his outlook was not narrow

 a German poet named Hyne has spoken in praise of Kant's philosophical life that proves him eccentric, but his ideas have influenced the subsequent philosophy so much that Kant's scholar considers him the originator of a new era in philosophy
