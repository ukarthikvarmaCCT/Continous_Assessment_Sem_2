 He was also called Banabhatta of Saharanpur and Khalil Jibran of Hindi

 Prabhakar ji, who created the literature of ideals, was an honest writer
 unhone spasht kaha he - "apane sahitya main main sabakaa mitra hum par patrakarita main main kisi kaa mitra nahin hua - haa, shatru bhi nahin ! unki patrakarita na dalon main uljhi, na vyaktiyon main
 Criticism of what is useful to society, its appreciation and what is harmful

 shikharji yaa shri shikharji yaa parasnath parvat bharat ke jharkhand rajya ke giridih zile main chota nagpur pathaar par sthit ek pahari he jo vishwa kaa sabase mahatvapurn jain tirth sthal bhi he
 20 of the 24 Tirthankaras of Jainism attained salvation in this saintly region known as 'shri Sammed Shikharji'
 yaheen 23 wein tirthakar bhagwaan parswanath ne bhi nirvana praapt kiya tha
 It is believed that 20 of the 24 Jains attained salvation
 1,350 meter unchaa yah pahaad jharkhand kaa sabase ooncha sthaan bhi he
 Shikharji is an important pilgrimage site for the followers of Jainism
 parasnath parvat vishwa prasiddh he

 sammed shikhar jain dharm ko maanane waalon kaa ek pramukh tirth sthaan he
 It is considered to be the best among Jain pilgrimages
 jain dharamshastron ke anusaar jain dharm ke 24 main se 20 tirthankarasn or anek santon va muniyon ne yahan moksh praapt kiya tha
 Therefore it is called 'siddhakshetra' and in Jainism it is called Tirtharaj i
e
 'king of Tirthas'
 yah tirth bharat ke jharkhand pradesh ke giridih jile main madhuban kshetra main sthit he
 It is the main pilgrimage of Jainism
 ise 'parasnath parvat' ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 According to Jain texts, the existence of both Samamed Shikhar and Ayodhya is parallel to creation
 isliye inako 'shaashvat' mana jaataa he 
 Here in ancient texts, Tirthankaras and ascetic saints attained salvation through rigorous penance and meditation
 yahi kaaran he ki jab sammed shikhar tirthayatra shuru hoti he to har tirthayatri kaa man tirthankarasn kaa samaran kar apaar shraddha, aasthaa, utsaah or khushi se bharaa hota he
 It is written in Jainism scriptures that once a soulful pilgrimage to the Samkad Shikhar shrine in one's life, a person does not get animal vagina and hell after death
 yah bhi likhaa gaya he ki jo vyakti sammed shikhar aakar puure man, bhav or nishtha se bhakthi karata he, use moksh praapt hota he or is sansar ke sabhi janm-karm ke bandhanon se agle 49 janmon tak mukt vah rahata he
 All this is possible only when all the devotees here remember the Tirthankaras and follow the teachings, teachings and principles given by them with pure conduct
 is prakaar yah kshetra bahut pavitra mana jaataa he
 The natural violent behavior of wild animals like lions, tigers, etc
 found here is not seen due to the sanctity and sattvikta of this region
 is kaaran tirthayatri bhi bina bhay ke yatra karte hai
 It is probably because of this effect that many kings, Acharyas, Bhattaraks, Shravaks from ancient times came here with huge groups for pilgrimage in the spirit of self-welfare and salvation, worshiping Tirthankaras, meditating and performing rigorous penance
 jain niti shastron main varnan he ki jain dharm ke 24 tirthankarasn main se pratham tirthankar bhagwaan 'adinath' arthath bhagwaan rishabhdev ne kailash parvat par, 12wein tirthankar bhagwaan vasupujya ne champapuri, 22wein tirthankar bhagwaan neminath ne girnaar parvat or 24wein or antim tirthankar bhagwaan mahavir ne pavapuri main moksh praapt kiya

 To top it all, shortly after the announcement, an online petition appeared to inspire Stallone to complete these scenes
 At the 2008 comic-con it was vaguely announced that the director's cut would be released in 2009, although no further details were provided

 It is also called as District Magistrate
 nitishastra jise vyavahaardarshan, nitidarshan, nitivigyaan or achaarshastra bhi kehete hai, darshan kii ek shakha hai
 Although the definition and field of ethics have been subject to differences in each age, it can be widely said that ethics discusses general principles on the basis of which human actions and objectives can be evaluated
 adhiktar lekhak or vichaarak is baat se bhi sahamat hai ki achaarshastra kaa sambandh mukhyat: manandadon or mulyon se he, na ki vastusthitiyon ke adhyayan yaa khoj se or in mandandon kaa prayog na keval vyaktigat jivan ke vishleshan main kiya janaa chahie varan saamaajik jivan ke vishleshan main bhi
 By defining concepts such as good and bad, right and wrong, virtue and blame, justice and crime, ethics attempts to address questions of human morality
 bauddhik samiksha ke kshetra ke rup main, vah naitik darshan, varnatmak nitishastra, or mulya siddhant ke kshetron se bhi sambandhit hai
 Three major areas of practice in ethics are recognized: isame vakilo ore apane pakshakaar ko jo bhi salaah di jaati he usee ke hisaab se pakshakaar kaam karata he 
 Rushworth Keyder states that "definitions of" ethics "have generally included phrases such as 'science of ideal human character' or 'science of moral duty'
 " richard wiliam paul or linda elder kii paribhaasha ke anusaar, nitishastra "ek sankalpanaaon or siddhanton kaa samucchy hai, jo, kaunsa vyavhaar samvedan-samarth jeevon kii madad karata hai yaa unhen nuqasaan pahunchataa hai, ye nirdhaarit karne main hamaara maargdarshan karata hai"
 The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy states that the term ethics "is commonly used interchangeably with 'morality' 'and is sometimes more narrowly used to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group or individual"
 paul or elder kehete hai ki zyaadaatar log samjik prathaon, dharmik aasthaaon or vidhi inke anusaar vyavhaar karne or nitishastra ke madhya bhramit ho jate hai or nitishastra ko akeli sankalpana nahin maanate
 The term "ethics" has many meanings
 iskaa sandarbh darshanik nitishastra yaa naitik darshan se ho saktaa hai
 The behavior of man is studied in many scriptures from many perspectives
 maanavvyavahaar, prakruti ke vyapaaron kii bhaanti, kaary-kaaran-shrunkhlaa ke rup main hota he or uskaa karanmulak adhyayan evam vyakhya kii ja sakati he
 This is what psychology does
 kintu prakritik vyapaaron ko ham acha yaa bura kahkar visheshit nahin karte
 When we get wet due to sudden rain on the way, we do not say bad words to the clouds
 iske vipareet saathi manushyon ke karmon par ham baraabar bhale-bure kaa nirnay dete hai
 Thus the universal human tendency to pass judgment is the mother of ethics
 achaarshastra main ham vyavasthit rup se chintan karte hue yah jaanane kaa praytn karte hai ki hamaare achchhai-buraai ke nirnyon kaa buddhigrahya aadhaar kya he
 It is said that ethics is a regulatory or ideal science, while psychology is a theoretical science
 nishchay hi shastron ke is vargeekaran main kuch tathy he, par vah bhraamak bhi ho saktaa he
 The above classification may give rise to the notion that the work of ethics is not the exploration and inauguration of the rules of ethical behavior, but rather artificially inflating such rules on human society
 kintu yah dharna galat he
 The moral laws that ethics explores are inherent in the basic consciousness of man himself
 avashya hi yah chetana vibhinn samaajon tathaa yugon main vibhinn rup dhaaran karti dikhaai detii he
 The main reason for this diversity is the complexity of human nature and the diversity of human credit
 vibhinn deshkalon ke vichaarak apane samaajon ke prachlit vidhinishedhon main nihit naitik paimaanon kaa hi anveshan karte hai
 In our own era, due to the incorporation of many new old cultures, it may be possible for thinkers to rise above countless stereotypes and ambiguous beliefs, leading to the inauguration of virtually universal moral principles
 meta-nitishastra yah poochta hai ki ham isse kaise samajhate hai, iske bare main kaise jaanate hai or iskaa kya arth nikaalte hai, jab ham 'kya sahi hai' or 'kya galat hai' kii baat karte hai
 This is a positive squeeze of the problems going on in the mind
 mandandak nitishastra nitishastreey kriya kaa adhyayan hai
 It is that branch of ethics that examines a set of questions that originate when thinking how one should work ethically
 mandandak nitishastra meta-nitishastra se alag hai, kyonki yah kaaryon ke sahi yaa galat hone ke maanakon kaa parikshan karata hai, jabaki meta-nitishastra naitik bhashaa ke arth or naitik tathyon ke tatvamimasaa kaa adhyayan karata hai
 Critical ethics is also different from descriptive ethics, because there are empirical investigations into the moral beliefs of the posthumous people
 anya shabdon main, varnatmak nitishastra kaa sambandh yah nirdhaarit karne se hai ki kis anupaat ke log maanate hai ki hatya sadaiv galat hai, jabaki mandandak nitishastra kaa sambandh is baat se hai ki kya yah manyata rakhni galat hai
 Therefore, sometimes normative ethics is called normative rather than descriptive
 haalanki, meta-nitishastreey drushti ke kuch sanskarnon main jinhen naitik yatharthwaad kaha jaataa hai, naitik tathy ek hi vaqt par, donon varnatmak or nirdeshaatmak hote hai
 Traditional, normative ethics was the study of what makes an action what is right or wrong
 ye siddhanth mushkil naitik nirnyon kaa samaadhaan karne hetu vyapak naitik siddhanth pradaan karte hai
 Utilitarianism has always been a dominant view of humans
 yah vichaardhaara manushya ke aacharan ke us paksh ko parilakshith karti he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki == moral philosophy == manav jeevan me naitik sidhanton ko hi naitik darshan kehte hain raajnneetik nitishastra raajnneetik karrwai or raajnneetik agenton ke bare main naitik naitik nirnay lene kii pratha he
 Descriptive ethics is less inclined to the philosophical end of the screen because its purpose is to obtain specific information about how people live and to draw general conclusions based on vision patterns
 nitishastra kaa mul prashn kya he, is sambandh main do mahatvaparn mat paae jate hai
 According to one wish, the main problem of ethics is to tell what is the ultimate credit of human life
 param shrey kaa bodh ho jane par ham shubh karm unhen kahenge jo us shrey kii ore le janevaale hai; vipareet karmon ko ashubh kaha jayega
 According to the second wish, the main task of ethics is to clarify the notion of auspicious or religious
 duusare shabdon main, nitishastra kaa kaary us niyam yaa niyamsamooh kaa swaroop spasht karnaa he jis yaa jinke anusaar anushthit karm shubh athwa dharmik hote hai
 A
 Two intentions give rise to ideologies of two different categories
 param shrey kii kalpana anek prakaar se kii gai he; in kalpanaaon athwa siddhanton kaa varnan ham aage karenge
 Here we will discuss briefly how the rules of morality - if there are such rules - can be of any kind
 niyam yaa kanoon kii dharna yaa to rajya ke dandvidhaan se aati he yaa bhautik vigyaanon se, jahaan prakruti ke niyamon kaa ullekh kiya jaataa he
 State laws are created by the modifiable will of one type of ruler
 ve kabhi-kabhi kuch virgon ke hit ke liye banaae jate hai, unhen todaa bhi ja saktaa he or unke paalan se bhi kuch logon ko haani ho sakati he
 In contrast, the laws of nature are indivisible
 rajya ke niyam badale ja sakate hai, kintu prakruti ke niyam aparivartaneey hai
 The rules of policy or virtue are considered immutable, welfare for the follower and unenforceable
 in drushtiyon se nitishastra ke niyam swasthyavigyaan ke niyamon ke purnataya samaan hote hai
 It seems that man or human nature is spread under the control of two different categories of rules
 ek ore to manushya un kanoonon kaa vashwarti he jinka udghaatan yaa nirupan bhautik vigyaan, rasayanashastra, pranishastra, manovigyaan aadi tathyanveshi shastron main hota he or duusari ore swasthyavigyaan, tarkshastra aadi aadarshanveshi vigyaanon ke niyamon kaa, jinase vah baadhya to nahin hota, par jinka paalan uske sukh tathaa unnati ke liye aavashyak he
 The rules of ethics are of this second category
 nitishastra kii pramukh samasyaayein nimnlikhit he- We can divide the problems of ethics into three classes: param shrey ke bare main purv or pashchim main anek kalpanaayen kii gai hai
 Almost all philosophies in India believe that happiness is the ultimate goal of life, but most of them have a concept of happiness completely different from so-called euphemism
 is duusare yaa prachlit arth main ham keval charvak darshan ko saukhyavaadee kah sakate hai
 There is no systematic description of Charvak's moral intentions, but it is understood that in his euphemism, gross sensual pleasure is given importance
 bharat ke duusare darshan jis atyantik sukh ko jivan kaa lakshya kehete hai use apvarg, mukti yaa moksh athwa nirvana se samikrut kiya gaya he
 In the Nyaya and Samkhya Darshans, the category of exclusion or liberation is envisaged, it cannot be said to be an emotional pleasures but the liberation of the Upanishads and Vedanta can be said to be inward
 vedant kii mukti tathaa baudhon kaa nirvana, donon hi us sthiti ke dyotak hai jab vyakti kii aatma sukh du:kha aadi dwandvon se pare ho jaati he
 This condition can also come in lifetime; The pragya situated in the Bhagavad Gita is said to be a life-free one
 paashchaatya darshanon main param shrey ke sambandh main anek matvaad paae jate hai : There is also different scholasticism regarding what is the source or source of knowledge of our ultimate credit or good and inauspicious
 adhikansh pratyayvaadiyon ke mat main bhalaai-buraai ko bodh buddhi dwaara hota he
 This is the view of Hegel, Bradley etc
 and Kant's intent is also not opposed to it
 kaant maanate hai ki antat: hamaari krityabuddhi hi naitik aadarshon kaa strot he
 According to empiricists experience is the source of knowledge of our auspicious inauspiciousness
 yah mat naitik saapekshyatawad ko janm detaa he
 The third opinion is pratibhānavāda or up jhhvhjj)
 is mat ke anusaar hamaare bheetar ek aisi shakti he jo saakshaat dhang se shubh ashubh ko pahchaan yaa jaan leti he
 There are many forms of reflection
 shaiftsbari or hachesan naamak british darshanikon kaa vichaar tha ki rup ras aadi ko grahan karanevaali indriyon kii hi bhaanti hamaare bheetar ek naitik indriya bhi hoti he jo sidhe bhalaai buraai ko dekh leti he
 In the opinion of a thinker named Bishop Butler, we have a motivating instinct called Sadasadbuddhi which shows us the path of justification while resolving the duality between selfishness and altruism
 hamaare aacharan kii anek prerak vrittiyaan hai; ek vritti atmprem he, duusari par-hit-aakanksha 
 The place of Sadasadabuddhi is above these two, he is decisively distinguished above these two
 german vichaarak kaant kii gananaa pratibhanvaadiyon main bhi kii jaati he
 a common feature of conservative moral principles is that they do not consider it necessary to focus on the consequences of an action in order to decide the good of evil
 koi karm isliye shubh yaa ashubh nahin ban jaataa ki uske parinaam ek yaa duusari koti ke hai
 Or the preconception of all the results of a task is as difficult as it is to control them
 karm kii achchhai buraai uski prerana se nirdhaarit hoti he
 The karma that has an auspicious motivation at its core is satta karma, karma born in inauspicious inspiration is asatta karma or sin
 kaante kaa kathan he ki shubh sankalpabuddhi ek aisi cheez he jo swayan shreyrup he, jiskaa shreyatv nirpeksh evam nishchit he; shesh sab vastuon kaa shreyatv saapeksh hota he
 Only auspicious willpower is illuminated by its own form of light
 naitik shubh-ashubh ke gyaan kaa strot kya he, is sambandh main bhartiya vichaarkon ne bhi kai mat prakat kiye hai
 According to the Mimamsa philosophy, the ethics inspired by Shruti is dharma and the Karma prohibited by Shruti or Veda is unrighteousness
 is prakaar dharm evam adharm shrutiyon ke vidhi-nishedh-mulak hai
 Along with the teaching of Nishkam Karmayoga in the Bhagavad Gita, it has been said that the scripture is the proof for the knowledge of duty and duty
 shaastra ke antargat shruti tathaa smriti donon kaa pariganan hota he
 Different duties have been directed for each varna and ashram of Hinduism; a detailed discussion of these duties is found in the Dharmasutras and the Memoirs
 is koti ke kartavyon ke atirikt saamaanya dharm athwa saarvbhaum dharmaniyamon ke bodh ke liye ko bhi pramaan mana gaya he
 The ethos of gentlemen has been accepted as a pioneer
 naitik aacharan kii anivaaryta ke aadhaar bhi anek roopon main kalpit hue hai
 Religion has been the most important regulator of morality in the history of man
 hamen naitik niyamon kaa paalan karnaa chahie, kyonki vaisaa ishwar yaa dharmavyavastha ko isht he
 The second regulatory power of ethics is the state
