 If a person comes into contact with a blood group antigen that is not recognized as its own antigen, the immune system creates antibodies that specifically bind to that specific blood group antigen and bind to that antigen
 An immune memory is created against

 These antibodies can bind to the antigens present on the surface of the red blood cells present in the blood being delivered to the person, often causing destruction of cells by other components of the immune system

 anti-a and anti-b, which are common igm antibodies to RBC surface antigens of the ABO blood group system, are sometimes described as "naturally occurring"; However, this is a misnomer, as these antibodies are formed in the nascent state by sensitization in the same way as other antibodies

 The International Blood Transfusion Society has currently identified 30 blood group systems
 Thus, in addition to ABO and Rhesus antigens, the presence of several other antigens on the superficial membrane of the red blood cell has also been expressed

 In the context of transfusion of whole blood or packed red blood cells, persons with o negative blood type are often called universal donors and those with AB positive blood type are called universal donors; However, these terms are true only with reference to the possible response of anti-a and anti-b antibodies to receptors of the transfected red blood cells, as well as possible sensitization to the rhd antigen

 Two of the most important blood group systems were discovered during early experiments with blood transfusions: the ABO group in 1901 and in 1937
 The Coombs test developed in 1945, with the advent of blood transfusions and understanding of the disease of blood degeneration in the newborn, more blood groups were discovered and 30 human blood group systems have been identified by the International Blood Transfusion Society, and More than 600 different blood group antigens have been found in 30 blood groups, but most of them are very rare or occur only in particular ethnic groups

 Literal classes are defined in terms of how their members combine with other types of expressions
 sangya ke liye bhashaavar vaakyatmak niyam bhinn hote hai
 In English, nouns can be defined as words with prefix and qualitative adjectives and can serve as the head of a noun phrase
 paaramparik angrezi vyakaran main Noun, aath shabdabhedon main se ek he
 The word is derived from Latin nomen, meaning name
 Noun-word classes were first described by ancient Greeks such as Sanskrit grammar] and Dionysios thrax, and they were defined in terms of their morphological properties
 udhaaharan ke liye, pracheen greek main, sangya vyakaranik kaarak ke liye kriyaaroop prastut karte hai, jaise sampradaan kaarak yaa karm kaarak
 Natural language expressions have characteristics at various levels

 is lekh ke shuruuaat main is prakaar noun kii paribhaasha ek aupchaarik paaramparik vyakaranamulak paribhaasha he
 That definition is, for the most part, considered nonsensical and provides a means for users of certain languages to effectively distinguish multiple nouns from non-nouns
 tathaapi, isaki ek asuvidha he ki yah sabhi bhashaaon kii sangyaaon par lagu nahin hota he
 For example, in Russian there are no definitive prefixes, so nouns cannot be defined as words that are modified by decisive subparts
 sangyaaon ko unke arthgat visheshtaon ke aadhaar par paribhaashit karne ke bhi kai prayaas hue hai
 Many of these are controversial, but some are being discussed below
 vyakaran kii paaramparik vichaardhaara main aksar sangyaaon kii paribhaasha se saamana hota he ki ve sabhi or keval ve abhivyaktiyaan hai jo vyakti, sthaan, vastu, ghatana, padaarth, gunvattta, maatra, yaa vichaar, aadi se sandarbh rakhte hai
 This is the semantic definition
 isaki gair suchanaatmak ke rup main samakaleen bhashavidon dwaara aalochana kii gai he
 Contemporary linguists generally agree that successful definitions of nouns are not possible on the basis of which objects of the world they refer to or inform
 samasya kaa ansh he ki sangyaaen kya hai, ise paribhaashit karne ke liye paribhaasha apekshaakrit saamaanya sangyaaon kaa upyog karti he
 The existence of such common nouns indicates that nouns refer to elements that are well-organized in classification hierarchies
 lekin anya prakaar kii abhivyaktiyaan bhi aise sanrachit vargeekaran sambandhon main vyavasthit hote hai
 For example, the verb stroll, saunter, stride and tread are more specific words than the more common walk - see Troponymy
 In addition, the walk is more specific than the verb move, while less common than the change
 But it is unlikely that such classification relations can be used to define nouns and verbs
 ham kriyaapadon ko aise shabdon ke rup main paribhaashit nahin kar sakate hai jo parivartan yaa avasthaaon ko sanderbhit karte hai, udhaaharan ke liye sangyaaon ke parivartan or avasthaa sambhawatah aisi chizon ko sanderbhit karti hon, par nishchit rup se ve kriya nahin hai
 Similarly, nouns like invasion, meeting, or collapse refer to things that have happened or are happening
 vastav main, ek prabhaavshaalee siddhant yah he ki kill yaa die jaise kriyaapad ghatnaon ko sanderbhit karte hai, jo chizon kii ek aisi shrenee he jiskaa sangya dwaara ullekh apekshit he
 It is not being argued here that this view of verbs is incorrect, but rather that this property of the verb is a weak basis for the definition of this category, just as the presence of wheels is a weak basis for the definition of a car
 
 Similarly, adjectives such as yellow or difficult can be thought to refer to properties and appear to refer to adverbs such as outside or upstairs, which are things that nouns can refer to
 
 lekin kriya, visheshan or kriyavisheshan, sangyaaen nahin hai or sangyaaen kriya, visheshan yaa kriyavisheshan nahin hai
 It can be debated that these types of definitions are actually based on the speaker's prior nouns, verbs and adjectives about what they are and do not add anything more to it or more than that
 inke bare main vaktaaon kaa sahaj gyaan sambhawatah dekhne main aupchaarik maanakon par, yatha upar ullikhit angrezi nouns kii paaramparik vyakaranik paribhaasha par aadhaarit ho saktaa he
 Template: Unclear section British logician Peter Thomas Geach proposed a more efficient semantic definition of nouns
 unhone dekha ki "same" jaise visheshan noun kaa arth simit kar sakate hai lekin kriya yaa visheshan jaise anya shabd bhedon ke nahin
 itnaa hi nahin, kriya or visheshnon ko roopantarit karne vaale ekasmaan arth vaali anya koi abhivyaktiyaan bhi prathit nahin hoti
 nimnlikhit udaahranon par vichaar karen
 There is no adverb in English
 tathaapi check jaisi kuch anya bhashaaon main samely ke samanurup kriyavisheshan maujuud hai
 Therefore, in Czech, the translation of the previous sentence would be correct: however, it would mean that John and Bill fought together: not that both took part in the same battle
 gich ne Geach prastaavit kiya ki ham ise nirupit kar sakate hai, yadi pahchaan maanakon sahit taarkik vidhey ko dyotit karte hai
 For example, an identity criterion would allow us to conclude that person x is the same person in time 1 and person y in time 2
 alag noun kii alag pahchaan maanak hogi

 To say the same thing differently: at different times, you will correspond to two different passengers, even if you are one and the same person
 pahchaan maanak kii sateek paribhaasha ke liye dekhen gupta
 Another semantic definition of Unclear sectionnouns is that they are normatively normative
 haal hi main, mark baker ne prastaavit kiya he ki nouns ke sambandh main pahchaan maanakon ke sandarbh main gich kii paribhaasha nouns kii swaroopatmak visheshtaon kii vyakhya anumat karti he
 He argues that nouns can be found with conjectural subparts and numbers, and they are normatively normative because they are all and only fragments of verbiage that provide identification standards
 baker ke prastaav kaaphi nae hai or bhashavid ab bhi unka moolyankan kar rahe hai
 Proper nouns are nouns representing unique elements, which are different from common nouns describing a class of elements
 saamaanya rup se Proper nouns se purv upapad yaa anya pratibandhak visheshak kaa upyog nahin kiya jaataa he or yah shabd yaa vaakyansh ke kisi varnanaatmak arth kaa lihaaj kiye bina vishesh vyakti, sthaan yaa vastu ko nirupit karne ke liye prayukt hota he
 The meaning in a capital letter of a proper noun is uniqueness in the underlying context, meaning that it gives a name to the common type instance when an instance is unique in the underlying context
 isliye baad main kii gai charchaa ke anusaar, sandarbh badlaav ise prabhavit kar saktaa he 
 In English and most other languages, which use the Latin alphabet, proper nouns are usually written in capital letters
 bhashaaen is arth main alag hoti hai ki kya bahushabd vyaktivaachak sangyaaon ke adhikansh tatv bade aksharon main likhe gaye hai yaa keval praarambhik tatv 
 german main sabhi prakaar kii sangyaaon ko bade aksharon main likhaa jaataa he
 In English, the practice of writing all nouns in capital letters was in use, but ended around 1800
 america main, kai ullekhneey dastavezon main bade aksharon main badlaav darj kiya gaya he
 The end of the Declaration of Independence Bill and all nouns in the entire Constitution are written in capital letters, some caste nouns are written in capital letters in the Rights Bill, but most do not, and in the Thirteenth Constitutional Amendment only proper nouns are written in capital letters
 
 kabhi-kabhi sandarbh ke aadhaar par ek hi shabd donon, jativaachak sangya or vyaktivaachak sangya ke rup main kaary kar sakate hai
 Two variations of this theory can be shown, although this distinction is blurred by the use of real-world labels to refer to both types of examples
 inke saarvbhaumik sahamat koi naam nahin hai, lekin "capitonim" or "spacific decignator" kuch had tak prachlan main hai
 Capitonym is a word that changes its meaning when written in capital letters
 yah ek prakaar kaa samanaam he
 Sometimes the meaning of a capitalized conversion may be a special case of a lower-letter conversion, or it may be associated with a base-name
 udhaaharan ke liye: There are many words that are usually generic nouns but which can easily "temporarily function as proper nouns"
 Some examples are agency, avenue, boulevard, box, building, bureau, case, chapter, city, class, college, day, edition, floor, grade, group, hospital, level, office, page, paragraph, part, phase, road , school, stage, step, street, type, university, week
 The function of a temporary proper noun arises when the proper noun is a number or any other word to name for the specific mention of a abbreviation
 This is then referred to as the "specific Designator"
 udhaaharan ke liye: Because spelling categorization has various ambiguous cognitive structures, it is somewhat arbitrary, which implies that people can impose various meanings that are neither "wrong" and because of ambiguity they can easily distinguish their different structures from one Cannot describe the other
 lekin, pathak bade aksharon ke antar ko, arthath, asangattaaon ko paas-paas dekhnaa naapsand karte hai
 Therefore, many publishers try to encode the consistent operation of framing using style guides
 udhaaharan ke liye, associated press kaa e
pi
 stilbuk shabdkosh praaroop kaa upyog karata he or uski anek pravishtiyon main vah e
pi
patrakaron or sampadakon ko maargdarshan pradaan karata he ki jativaachak or vyaktivaachak bhaavon ke pratichhedan ke avasar par kaise e
pi
 ke pasandida tark ko susangat tareeqe se karyanvit kar sakate hai
 For example, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation is mentioned earlier, the capital letter is used for "bureau", because it is acting as a specific designator, that is, it is a generic noun "acting as a relevant proper noun
" 
 " tathaapi, parvarti ullekh, jaise ki "the bureau announced 


", main chota akshar prayog main laayaa jayega, kyonki shabd kaa upyog uske jativaachak sangya ke bhav main ho rahaa he
 The same logic applies for the word ocean
 e
pi
 kahata he, "ocean : The five, from the largest to the smallest: Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Antarctic Ocean, Arctic Ocean
 Lowercase ocean standing alone or in plural uses: the ocean, the Atlantic and Pacific oceans 
" american medical association kaa e
em
e
 minial of style, 10waan sanskaran isi prakaar apane upyogkartaaon ko maargdarshan detaa he
 For example, the style of AMA is not to use capital letters for words like level or case or stage, even if they are working as a specification-designator
 capitonim or spacific decignetteron kii prakruti aksar sambandhit hoti he: donon maamalon main, shabd mul ke jativaachak or vyaktivaachak bhav ek duusare ke saath tarksangat rup main jude ho sakate hai
 Some words can be viewed as capitonim or specific designators, evaluation being subjective
 udhaaharan ke liye: The topic integrating these capitonym / specic neutralists is that they are not just special cases in terms of changing from racist to subjective, but very specific cases, that is, in many instances a unique example
 Also, in the cases of celestial bodies, it is clear which sense came first: the proper sentiment
 When the first language developed, to the extent that humans began to understand their context, the sun and the moon were cosmic unique objects
 jaise-jaise maanav kaa sandarbh vistrut hua, saamaanya prakaar ke naam ke liye jativaachak sangyaaon kii unki nai zarurat kii purti retronim dwaara kii gai, jisamen jativaachak sangya rachane kaa sabase tarksangat tareeqa usee shabd ko uske vyapak bhav ke saath upyog main laayaa gaya
 The general meaning of the word or words constituting the proper noun may be unrelated to the object to which the proper noun is referring
 udhaaharan ke liye, tiger yaa smith naa hone ke baavjood kisi kaa naam Tiger Smith ho saktaa he
 This is why proper nouns are generally not translated between languages, although they may be transliterated
 udhaaharan ke liye, german upnaam Knödel angrezi main Knodel yaa Knoedel ho jaataa he nahin)
 lekin, jagah ke naam or raja, pope or gair-samakaleen lekhakon ke naamon kaa lipyantaran saamaanya or kabhi-kabhi saarvbhaumik he
 For example, the Portuguese word Lisboa becomes Lisbon in English; English London becomes Londres in French and Greek Ἁριστοτέλης Aristotelēs becomes Aristotle in English
 Count nouns jativaachak sangyaaen hai jo bahuvachan le sakati hai, sankhyaon yaa parimankon ke saath sanyojit ho sakate hai or anishchayvachak upapad ko le sakate hai
 Examples of countable nouns are chair, nose and occasion
 Mass nouns, count nouns se thik is ansh main alag hai ki ve bahuvachan nahin le sakate yaa sankhyatmak shabdon yaa parimankon ke saath jud nahin sakate
 angrezi se udaahranon main shaamil hai laughter, cutlery, helium, and furniture 
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek furniture yaa teen furniture kaa ullekh karnaa sambhav nahin he
 This is true even if the segments of furniture included in the furniture can be counted
 is prakaar mass or count nouns ke bich bhed is aadhaar par nahin kiya janaa chahie ki sangya kis prakaar ke chizon kaa sanket de rahi he, balki in tatwon ko sangya kis tarah prastut karti he
 Collective nouns are nouns that refer to more than one person or group of elements, despite presenting anonym for the singular
 udaahranon main shaamil hai committee, herd or school 
 anya sangyaaon kii tulana main in sangyaaon kaa vyakaranik gun thodaa alag he
 For example, nouns can serve as predicate verbs, despite the presentation of the noun for the singular to which they are subject
 ek samuhik vidhey aisa vidhey he jo saamanytah ekvachan karta ko nahin le saktaa he
 An example of the latter is talked among themselves
 Concrete nouns bhautik tatwon ko sanderbhit karti hai, jo kam se kam siddhanthata, ek bhav dwaara dekha ja sake 
 duusari ore Abstract nouns amoort chizon ko sanderbhit karte hai; yani, vichaar yaa avadharanaen 
 jabaki is tarah ke antar kabhi-kabhi upyogi hote hai, concrete or abstract ke bich kii seemaa hameshaa spasht nahin he, udhaaharan ke liye, sangya art, jo aam taur par avadharana ko sanderbhit karata he, lekin jo kuch sandarbhon main vishisht kalakriti kaa ullekh kar saktaa he 
 In English, many abstract nouns are created by adding nouns to suffixes in adjectives or verbs
 udhaaharan hai happiness, circulation or serenity 
 Nouns and noun phrases can usually be replaced by pronouns such as he, it, which and those to avoid repetitive or explicit identification, or for some other reason
 For example, in the sentence Janet thought that he was weird, the word he is a pronoun, which is present in place of the name of the person in question
 angrezi shabd one or sangya vaakyanshon ke hisson kii jagah le saktaa he, yah kabhi-kabhi sangya ke liye maujuud hota he
 An example is given below: lekin one sangya vaakyansh ke bade up-bhaagon ke liye bhi maujuud ho saktaa he
 For example, in the following example, one may exist for a new car
 puraane latin vyakaran ke saath shuruuaat sahit, kai europea bhashaaen sangya ke liye buniyadi shabd ke rup main sattasuchak shabd ke kisi na kisi rup kaa upyog karti hai 
 aisi bhashaaon ke shabdkoshon main sangya ko n ke bajaay s
 yaa sb
 sanketakshar se chihnit kiya jaataa he, joki iske bajaay vyaktivaachak sangyaaon ke liye prayukt hota he
 This corresponds to grammars in which nouns and adjectives, for example the English word predicative adjective, tend to be oriented towards each other in many areas
 french or spanish main, udhaaharan ke liye, visheshan aksar sangya kii tarah kaam karte hai jahaan visheshan kii visheshtaon vaale logon ko ve sanderbhit karte hai
 The most common dialect name of this concept is cognizance
 An example in English is: isi tarah, ek visheshan bhi ek puure samooh yaa logon ke sanghathan ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he: Therefore, these words are satyachak which are generally adjective in English
 sangya ke prakaar There are five types of noun: shabd nominal bhi sangya or visheshan ke saath arth tathaa upyog main paraspar vyaapt karata he
 Guns and Roses is an American hard rock band

 In 1990, Guns and Roses returned to the studio to begin recording their most ambitious venture ever

 a few months ago, keyboardist Dizzy Reid became the sixth member of the group when he joined the band as a full-time member
 band ne may 1991 main apane prabandhak, alan niven ko nikaal diya or unki jagah dag goldstin ko rakh liya

 Among the many successful performances during the tour, many of the performances were similarly compared to riots, late starts and harsh condemnation by Rose and faded several times in front of the press

 Rose was accused of inciting the riots, but the police failed to arrest him for nearly a year as the band went overseas to continue the tour
 rose ke khilaaf lagaae gaye aaropon ko darj to kar liya gaya lekin ek nyaayadhish ne faisla suna diya ki unhone pratyaksh rup se dange ko nahin uksaaya tha
 In his defense, Roses stated that the Guns and Roses security team asked the venue's security personnel about the camera, which was reported by other band members as spectators throwing bottles at the camera and limiting the drinking limit Refused to enforce, made four separate requests for removal, all of which were ignored
 parinaam yah hua ki yuz yor iluzan kii kalakriti main album ke thank you bhaag main ek chipa sandesh: "bhaad main jaao, saint louis" nihit tha
 Following a replay of the St

 Axl Rose actually wanted to replace Stradlin with Jens Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro, but eventually Stradlin was replaced by Los Angeles-based guitarist Gilby Clarke whom Slash credited with saving the band
 puure daure main kai kaaryakramon ke dauraan rose ne clark ko saamne khadaa kiya or unhen "wild horces" kaa pradarshan karne kaa avasar pradaan kiya tha jo slash ke saath rolling stones kaa ek cover geet tha

 baad main usee saal ve america metal band metalika ke saath mini-gnr-metalika stadium tour par gaye
 Metallica lead singer James Hetfield burned badly during an event at the Montreal Olympic Stadium in August 1992 when he was too close to a fireworks or explosion of firecrackers
 metalika ko kaarykram ke duusare ghante ko radd karne par baadhya hona padaa, lekin unhone ek anya kaarykram ke liye shahar main waapas aane kaa vachan diya

 In addition, Rose said that he had a neck injury that left the band very soon
 Once the show was canceled, the audience once again started rioting, reminiscent of the riots that took place in St
 Louis a year earlier
 dangaiyon ne gadiyon ko ulat diya, khidakiyon ko tod diya, sthaneey dukaanon ko lut liya or unamem aag laga diya
 sthaneey adhikariyon ne badi mushkil se bheed par kaabo paaya

 Interviews with members of the Guns and Roses band suggested that between 1994 and 1996 the band began to create and record sporadic new material, most of which, according to Slash, was composed by Rose
 
 us samay, band ne 10 yaa 12 gaanon vaala ek album release karne kaa vichaar kiya tha
 In connection with the band's recording of the time, Rose is quoted as saying "we still needed the support of the entire band to produce the best songs
" chunki unamem se kuch bhi nahin hua, yahi kaaran he ki kyon us saamagree ko nikaal diya gaya
 " disambar 1994 main gans and rojez ne rolling stones kii "simpathy for da devil" kii ek cover recording ko release kiya

 gregorian calendar {gregory kaaldarshak}, duniya main lagbhag har jagah upyog kiya jane vaala kaaldarshak yaa tithipatrak he
 This is the adaptation of the Julian calendar
 ise pope gregory ne lagu kiya tha
 Prior to this, the Julian calendar was in vogue, but it contained many errors, which were corrected in the Gregorian calendar
 gregory kaaldarshak kii mul ikai din hota he
 There is a year of 365 days, but every fourth year is of 366 days, which is called leap year
 surya par aadhaarit panchang har 146,097 dinon baad doharaaya jaataa he
 It is divided over 400 years and equals 20871 weeks
 in 400 varshon main 303 varsh aam varsh hote hai, jiname 365 din hote hai
 And there are 97 leap years, consisting of 366 days
 is prakaar har varsh main 365 din, 5 ghante, 49 minute or 12 second hote he
 In the Julian calendar, 365 days was considered a 6-hour year, but assuming it takes 11 minutes 14 seconds more than a revolutionary solar year each year
 yah aadhiky 400 varshon main 3 din se kuch adhik ho jaataa he
 Pope Gregory of Rome first considered this mistake subtly
 unhone isvi san 1582 main hisaab lagaakar dekha ki naaise nagar ke dharm-sammelan ke samay se, jo isvi san 325 main hua tha, purvokt aadhiky 10 din kaa ho gaya he, jisko gananaa main nahin lene ke kaaran taarikh 10 din peeche chal rahi thi
 With this idea, he decided the 15th of October in 1582 AD in consultation with the astrologer Allay Sius Lilius of Naples, and since then took the rule that the century, if divided completely by 400, instead of being completely divided by year 4 It should be considered as leap year or not
 is naveen paddati kaa aarambh chunki pope gregory ne kiya, isliye isko gregorian paddati athwa naveen paddati kaha gaya
 This method was accepted in different Christian countries in different years
 isse in deshon kaa itihaas padhate samay is baat ko dhyaan main rakhana aavashyak he
 This new method was adopted by Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal in 1582, Prussia, the Roman Catholic Territories of Germany, Switzerland and Flanders in 1583, Poland in 1586, Hungary in 1587, Protestants from Germany and the Netherlands
 Territory and Denmark in 1700, British Empire in 1752, Japan in 1972, China in 1912, Bulgaria in 1915, Turkey and Soviet Russia in 1917 and Yugoslavia and Su Romania adopted in 1919 AD
 1582 isvi ke baad 1700 i0 main 28 farvari tak puraane calendar se naye calendar kii taarikh main 10 din kii hi vruddhi rahi
 Since 1600 AD was a century, it was completely divided by 400, so it would have been a leap year by the new method
 atah usamen taarikh main antar karne hetu 1 din kii vruddhi nahin hui
 This means that changing the date from the old calendar to the new calendar will be progressively increased from the aforesaid 10 days to one day in the same century years in which the 400 years do not completely participate
 arthath 1700 isvi kii 28 farvari ke baad naye calendar kii taarikh banane ke liye 10 din kii jagah 11 din jode jaayenge
 Similarly, 12 days will be added after 28 February of 1800 AD and 13 days after 28 February of 1900 AD
 punah 2000 i0 400 se puri tarah vibhajit hone ke kaaran yah vruddhi 13 din kii hi rahegi, atirikt 1 din nahin badhegaa

 Most animals are moving, that is, they can move on their own and independently
 zyaadaatar jantu parposhi bhi hote hai, arthath ve jeene ke liye duusare jantu par nirbhar rahete hai
 The maximum known animal phyla appeared in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian eruption 542 million years ago
 shabd 'animal' latin bhashaa ke shabd animale, nauter of animalis, se aayaa he or anima se vyutpann hua he, jiskaa arth he jivit shwaas yaa aatma
 In common colloquial language, the term is used for non-human animals
 is shabd kii jaivik paribhaasha main maanav sahit kingdom animalya ke sabhi sadsy shaamil hai
 Animals have many special qualities that differentiate them from other living things
 jantu eukeriotic or bahu koshikeey hote hai,, jo unhen jeevanu va adhikansh protista se alag karte hai
 They are heterotrophic, usually digesting food in an inner chamber, which makes them distinct from plants and algae, they can also be differentiated from plants, algae and fungi because they lack a hard cell wall
 All animals are moving, even if they are in a particular phase of life
 adhiktam jantuon main, bhrun ek blastula avasthaa se hokar gujarata he, yah jantuon kaa ek vibhedak gun he
 With few exceptions, most notably sponges and placozoa, the bodies of animals differentiate into different tissues
 in main mansapeshiyaan shaamil hai, jo sankuchan tathaa gati ke niyantran main sakasham hoti hai or tantrika utak, jo sanket bhejtaa he va un par pratikriya karata he
 They also have a typical internal digestive chamber consisting of 1 or 2 holes
 jin jantuon main is prakaar kaa sanghathan hota he, unhen metazon kaha jaataa he, yaa tab eumetazon kaha jaataa he jab, purv kaa prayog saamaanya rup se jantuon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 All animals have eukaryotic cells, which are surrounded by extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoprotein
 yah khol, asthi or kantak jaisi sanranchanaaon ke nirmaan ke liye kelsikrut ho sakati hai
 During development, it forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move and reorganize, creating possible complex structures
 iske vipareet, anya bahukoshikeey jeev jaise paudhe or kavak kii koshikaayen koshika bhitti se ghiri hoti hai or is prakaar se pragatisheel vruddhi dwaara viksit hoti hai
 In addition, animal cells have a unique property of intercellular joints: tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes
 lagbhag sabhi jantu kisi prakaar ke langik prajnan kii prakriya se hokar guzarate hai: poliploid
 These have some specialized reproductive cells that undergo meiosis to produce small motile spermatozoa or large sedentary eggs
 ye sangalit hokar yugmanaj banaate hai, jo viksit hokar nayaa jeev banaata he
 Many animals also have asexual reproductive capacity
 yah anishekajanan ke dwaara ho saktaa he, jahaan bina nishechan ke anda bhrun main viksit ho jaataa he, kuch maamalon main vikhandeekaran ke dwaara bhi aisa sambhav he
 The zygote initially develops into a hollow sphere called blastula, it undergoes a process of rearrangement and differentiation of cells
 spanj main, blastula larva tair kar ek nae sthaan par chalaa jaataa he or ek nae spanj main viksit ho jaataa he
 In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complex rearrangements
 yah pehle antar valayit hokar ek gestrula banaata he, jisamen ek pachan kaksh or do alag janan str hote hai-ek bahari bahyatvak str or ek aantarik antah tvak str
 Prey is a biological interaction in which a predator receives food from its prey
 shikari jeev apane shikaar jeev khaane se pehle maar bhi sakate hai or nahin bhi, lekin shikaar kii prakriya kaa parinaam hameshaa shikaar jeev kii mrityu hi hoti he
 Another major category of consumption is dead nutrition, consumption of dead organic matter
 kai baar in donon prakaaron ke khaadya vyavhaaron main vibhed karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye, paraseete prajati ek parposhi jeev kaa shikaar karti he or phir us par apane andey detii he, taaki unki santati iske apaghatit hote hue carbonic dravya se bhojan praapt kar sake
 The selective pressure exerted on one another has led to an evolutionary race between prey and predator, resulting in many anti-predator adaptations
 zyaadaatar jantu apratyaksh rup se surya ke prakaash se hi urja praapt karte hai
 Plants use this energy to convert sunlight into simple sugars using a process called photosynthesis
 prakaash sanshleshan kii prakriya carbon dioxide or jal ke saath shuru hoti he, isamen surya ke prakaash kii urja ko rasinic urja main badal diya jaataa he, jo glucose ke bandhon main sanchit ho jaati he, is prakriya ke dauraan oxigen bhi mukt hoti he
 Now this sugars are used as manufacturing units, which leads to plant growth
 jab pashu in paudhon ko khate hai, paudhon ke dbaara utpann kii gayi sharkara jantuon ke dwaara kaam main le lee jaati he
 It either aids in the direct development of the animal or decomposes and is stored solar energy and thus the animal receives the energy required for movement
 yah prakriya glycolysis ke naam se jaani jaati he Animals that live close to water heat exhausts or cold seeps on the ocean floor are not dependent on the energy of the sun
 iske bajaay, rasayan sanshleshi jeev or jeevanu khaadya shrinkhalaa kaa aadhaar banaate hai
 ] aam manyata he ki jantu ek kashabhiki eukeriot se viksit hue hai
 Their closest known living relatives are the Coeno flagellum, the collard flagellum whose morphology is similar to the Coeno sites of specific sponges
 aanvik adhyayan jantuon ko ek param samooh main rakhata he, jise opisthokont kaha jaataa he, isamen bhi koeno kashabhiki, kavak or kuch chote paraseete protista ke jantu shaamil hai
 The first fossils that represent animals appeared around the end of the Precambrian period, about 610 million years ago and are called the Ediacaran or Vendian biota
 lekin inhen baad ke jeevashm se sambandhit karnaa kathin hai kuch aadhunik sanghon ke purvavartiyon kaa pratinidhitiv kar sakate hai, lekin ve alag samooh ho sakate hai or yah bhi sambhav he ki ve vastav main jantu na hon
 Except for them, the most known animal phyla appeared automatically during the Cambrian era, 542 million years ago
 yah abhi bhi vivaadit he, ki yah ghatana jise cambrian visphot kaha jaataa he, bhinn samoohon ke bich teevr vichlan kaa pratinidhitiv karti he yaa paristhitiyon main un parivartanon kaa pratinidhitiv karti he jisane jeevashmeekaran ko sambhav banaaya
 Although some archaeologists and geologists suggest that animals appeared much earlier than previously thought, probably 1 billion years ago
 Fossil insignia such as trails and burrows found in the Tonian era indicate the presence of three-dimensional worms such as metazoa
 Likely earthworms would have been large and complex
 iske alaava lagbhag 1 billian varsh purv tonian yug kii shuruyaat main, stromatolait main kami aayi
 The diversity that currently informs the arrival of animals grazing as stromatolites increased diversity, shortly after the end of the Ordovician and Permian, causing large numbers of grazing marine animals to become extinct in their populations
 Shortly after the recovery, their number decreased
 vah khoj jo in praarambhik jeevashm chinhon ke bahut adhik saamaan he, unki utpatti aaj ke vishaal aakar ke ek koshikeey protista ke jeev gromia sferica ke dwaara hui he, is par praarambhik jantu ke vikaas ke pramaan ke rup main unki vyakhya par andeh he
 For a long time, sponges were considered different from other early animals
 jaisaa ki upar bataaya gaya he, anya adhikansh sanghon main paaya jane vaala jatil sanghathan inamen nahin paaya jaataa he, unki koshikaayen vibhedit hai, lekin adhikansh maamalon main alag alag utakon main sangathit nahin hai
 The sponges are stems and usually draw water through their pores to obtain food
 aarkiokaitha, jisamen sangalit kankal hota he, vah spanj kaa yaa ek alag sangh kaa pratinidhitiv kar saktaa he
 However, a Fellow genomic study of 150 genes in 21 species in 2008 suggests that it is Tinophora or comb jelly that forms the basis of animals in at least 21 of those associations
 lekhak vishwaas rakhte hai ki spanj yaa kam se kam ve spanj jo unhone khoje hai- itane aadim nahin hai, lekin iske bajaay dwitiyak rup se sarlikrut kiye ja sakate hai
 In other phyla, Tinophora and Nideria, including sea anemones, corals, and jellyfish, are radially symmetric, having a digestive chamber with a single pore, which serves both the mouth and the anus
 donon main spasht vibhedit utak hote hai, lekin ye angon main sangathit nahin hote hai
 There are only two main germ levels, ectoderm and endoderm, between which only the cells are scattered
 isi liye in jantuon ko kabhi kabhi diploblactic kaha jaataa he
 Small placozoa are similar, but do not have a permanent digestive chamber
 shesh jantu ek sangheey samooh banaate hai jo bailetria kehalaata he
 For the maximum part, they are bilateral symmetric and often have a specialized head consisting of food organs and sensory organs
 sharir tripaloblastic hota he, arthath, teenon janan paraten purna viksit hoti hai or utak vibhedit ang banaate hai
 The digestive chamber has two holes, a mouth and an anus, as well as an internal body cavity which is also called a celome or virtual body cavity
 in main prayek lakshan ke apwaad hai, haalaanki- vyask ekainodermet trigyat samamit hota he or vishisht paraseete jantuon main bahut hi sarlikrut shaareerik saranchana hoti he
 Genetic studies have changed our knowledge of relationships within the Bilateria to a great extent
 adhikansh do mukhya vanshawaliyon se sambandh rakhte hai: duterostome or protostome, jinamein shaamil hai ekadsojoa, platizoa or lophotrocojoa
 In addition to this, there are some small groups of bipartite asymmetrical organisms that appear to be diffusing to these main groups
 in main shaamil hai esolmorpha, rombojoa or orthonekatida
 Mixozoa, a unicellular parasite originally thought to be protozoan, are thought to have evolved from the Bilateria
 duterostome anya bailetria, protostome se kai prakaar se bhinn hai
 In both cases a complete digestive tract is found
 haalanki, protostome main praarambhik chhidr muh main viksit hota he or guda alag se viksit hoti he
 This is the reverse in deuterostomes
 adhikansh protostome main, koshikaayen saadhaaran rup se gestrula ke aantarik bhaag main bhar jaati hai or madhya janan str banaati hai, yah shaijosilas vikaas kehalaata he, lekin duterostome main yah antar janan str ke antervalan se banataa he, jise entrocelic pouching kaha jaataa he
 Deuterostomes have a dorsal nerve cord rather than a ventral and their embryos undergo a different cleavage
 yah sab vivaran bataata he ki duterostome or protostome alag ek sangheey str hai
 The major associations of deuterostomes are echinodermata and chordata
 pehle vaala trigyat samamit he or vishesh rup se samudri he, jaise tara machhlee, samudri archin or samudri khiraa
 The second one consists mainly of vertebrate organisms in which the spinal cord is found
 in main shaamil hai machhlee, ubhaychar, reptiles, pakshi or standhari
 Apart from these, deuterostomes also include Hemicordetta and Akon worms
 haalaanki ve vartmaan main mukhyatah nahin paae jate hai, mahatvapurn jeevashmi pramaan inase sambandh rakhte hai
 Chatognatha or arrow worms may also be deuterostomes, but more recent studies show their association with protostomes
 ekadsojoa protostome hai, jinka yah naam paritvakabhavan yaa nirmochan ke dwaara vruddhi ke vishesh lakshan ke aadhaar par diya gaya he
 The largest animal union, Arthropoda, belongs to them, including worms, spiders, crabs and their close relatives

 The remaining two groups of protostomes are sometimes placed along the spiral, as embryonic development occurs in both with spiral cleavage
 platizoa main shaamil he sangh platihelminthij, chapate krimi
 Originally they were thought to be the most primitive types of bipartite, but they are now thought to have evolved from more complex ancestors
 is samooh main kai paraseete shaamil hai, jaise fluke or feeta krimi
 Flatworms are angular, lacking a body cavity, as in their closest relative, the microbe Gastrotrica
 platizoa ke anya sangh zyaadaatar sookshm darsheey or abhaasi dehguha se yukt hote hai
 The most prominent are rotifera or rotifers, which are common in aquatic environments
 inamen aconthociphela yaa shalki-sheersh vaale krimi shaamil hai, gnethostomulida, micrognethojoa or sambhawatah sicleophora
 These groups have complex jaws, due to which they are called Gnathifera
 donon hi samooh lambey arase se nikat sambandhi maane jate hai, kyonki donon main hi trocofor larva paaya jaataa he, lekin enelida ko aarthropoda ke adhik najadik mana jaataa tha
 Because they both fragment
 ise aam taur par sansruth vikaas mana jaataa he, kyonki donon sanghon ke bich kai aakaariki or anuvanshik bhed hai
 Lophotrochozoa also includes the Nemertia or Ribbon worm, Sipuncula, and several associations that have a fan of cilia around the mouth, called the lophophore
 inhen paaramparik rup se lopho forates ke saath samoohit kiya jaataa tha
 But now it appears that they are paraphyletic, some close to Nemertia and some close to Mollusca and Annelida
 inamen brekiopoda yaa lemp shell shaamil hai, jo jeevashm ricord main mukhya hai, ye hai antoneprokataa, foronida, ore sambhawatah bryojoa yaa mos jantu
 Due to the large diversity found in animals, it is more economical for scientists to study a small number of selected species, in order to correlate their work and findings on how animals normally function
 We do
 kyonki unhen rakhana ore unamem sankaran karana aasaan he, fal makkhi drosophila melanogaster, ore nimetode kenorehabditis eligens lambe samay se vyapak adhyayan kiye jane vaale namoonay ke jeev rahen hai or pehle jivan roopon main se the jinhen anuvanshik rup se anukramit kiya gaya
 This was facilitated by the much more reduced state of their genome, but here the two-edged sword with multiple genes, introns, and linkage lost, organisms of Ecdysozoa can teach us a little bit about the origin of animals in general

 They, no more than we, can let these things go by without doing something
 They can't, after all their statements, permit us to take out their missiles, kill a lot of Russians, and then do nothing

:261, he said, so the strategic balance was not going to change fundamentally as the Soviet Union had 340
 In 1990 he reiterated that "it did not make any difference

 Colombia was reported ready to furnish units and had sent military officers to the US to discuss this assistance

 Such a blockade might be expanded to cover all types of goods and air transport
 The action was to be backed up by surveillance of Cuba
 The cno's scenario was followed closely in later implementing the quarantine

 While a new message from Khrushchev began to arrive at 11:03 am EST while the meeting was going on, part of the message said, You are disturbed over Cuba
 You say that this disturbs you because it is ninety miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America
 But


 you have placed destructive missile weapons, which you call offensive, in Italy and Turkey, literally next to us


 i therefore make this proposal: We are willing to remove from Cuba the means which you regard as offensive

 At 4:00 pm EST, Kennedy again called Exom members at the White House and ordered that a message be immediately sent to u Thant to tell the Soviet to "suspend" missile action while negotiations were underway
 During this meeting, Maxwell Taylor reported that U-2 had been shot down
 kennedy ne pehle hi kah diya tha ki agar hamalaa hua to ve un sthalon par hamale kaa aadesh denge, lekin unhone tay kiya ki ve aisa tab tak nahin karenge jab tak ki duusari baar hamalaa nahin hota
 After 40 years, mcnamara said in an interview: We had to send a U-2 over to gain reconnaissance information on whether the Soviet missiles were becoming operational
 We believed that if the U-2 was shot down that—the Cubans didn't have capabilities to shoot it down, the Soviets did—we believed if it was shot down, it would be shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air-missile unit, and that it would represent a decision by the Soviets to escalate the conflict
 And therefore, before we sent the U-2 out, we agreed that if it was shot down we wouldn't meet, we'd simply attack
 It was shot down on Friday 
 Fortunately, we changed our mind, we thought "well, it might have been an accident, we won't attack
" Later we learned that Khrushchev had reasoned just as we did: we send over the U-2, if it was shot down, he reasoned we would believe it was an intentional escalation
 And therefore, he issued orders to Pliyev, the Soviet commander in Cuba, to instruct all of his batteries not to shoot down the U-2
 Messengers were sent by Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev on Saturday evening of October 27 in Washington D

 Unbeknownst to most of Exom's members, Robert Kennedy held a meeting with the USSR ambassador in Washington to get a sense of the intentions

 Fomin and Scally reunite at Juan Brito's request
 scally ne poocha ki khrushchev ke do patr itane alag kyon hai, to fomin ne daawa diya ki "kharaab sampreshan" ke kaaran aisa hua hoga
 Scally replied that the claim was not credible and shouted that he thought it was "a useless deception"
 They went on to say that the invasion was now only a matter of a few hours, at which point Fomin said that Khrushchev was expected to respond to the US message and asked Skalie to tell the State Department Urged that there was no intention of deceit
 scally ne kaha ki unhen nahin lagata ki koi is par vishwaas karegaa, lekin ve sandesh de dene ke liye sahamat ho gaye
 The two went their separate paths and Scali immediately typed a memo for Exom

 In his agreement with the US Attorney General Robert Kennedy, the Soviet Ambassador Antoine Dobranin informally proposed that the Jupiter missiles in Turkey be lifted "within a few days of the end of the crisis"

 It is possible that Khrushchev had placed missiles in Cuba only to have Kennedy withdraw missiles from Italy and Turkey, while the Soviets had no intention of going to the asylum of nuclear war; Provided they are shot and killed by Americans
 However, since the withdrawal of Jupiter missiles from NATO bases in southern Italy and Turkey was not made public at the time, Khrushchev appeared to be losing the conflict and weakened
 dharna yah bani ki mahashaktiyon ke bich kii ladaai main kennedy jeet gaye or khrushchev apamaanit ho gaye
 However, this case is not entirely correct as both Kennedy and Khrushchev took every step to avert complete conflict despite pressure from their own governments
 Khrushchev remained in power for the next two years
 :102-105 The agreement was particularly embarrassing for Khrushchev and the Soviet Union, as the withdrawal of American missiles from Italy and Turkey was not made public - it was a secret agreement between Kennedy and Khrushchev

 Two years after Khrushchev withdrew from power, he may have had a partial stake in the Politburo's embarrassment, both for his potential concession to the US and his inability to be oblivious to the crisis at the right time
 haalanki, cuba missile sankat khrushchev ke patan ke liye akele jimmedaar nahin tha
 Cuba took it as a partial betrayal by the Soviet Union to decide how to solve this crisis by Kennedy and Khrushchev

 Later, when he understood a little, only then could he be free from this badness
 ramprasad ne urdu middle kii pariksha main uteern na hone par angreji padhanaa prarambh kiya
 At the same time, a priest of the neighborhood got Ramprasad knowledge of the method of worship
 pujari ek sulajhe hue vidwaan vyakti the
 His personality also had an impact on Ramprasad's life
 pujari ke upadeshon ke kaaran ramprasad puja-paath ke saath brahmacharya kaa paalan karne laga
 Ramprasad also started exercising after seeing the priest
 kishoravastha kii jitani bhi kubhaavnaayen evam buree aadaten man main thim ve bhi chhot gayin
 Cigarette smoking did not stop
 parantu vah bhi kuch dinon baad vidhyalay ke ek sahpaathee sushilchandra sen kii satsangati se chhot gayi
 After giving up cigarettes, Ramprasad's mind started studying
 bahut sheeghra hi vah angreji ke paanchaven darze main aa gaye
 There was an unexpected change in Ramprasad
 sharir sundar va balishtha ho gaya tha
 Time was spent in regular worship
 isi dauraan vah mandir main aane vaale munshi indrajit se uskaa sampark hua
 Munshi Indrajit told Ramprasad about the Arya Samaj and gave the book Satyarth Prakash written by Swami Dayanand Saraswati
 satyarth prakaash ke gambheer adhyayan se ramprasad ke jivan par ascharyajanak prabhaav padaa
 When Ramprasad was an eighth grade student at Government School Shahjahanpur, then by chance, Swami Somdev came to the Arya Samaj Bhavan
 munshi indrajit ne ramprasad ko swamiji kii seva main niyukt kar diya
 It was here that changes in both the condition and direction of his life began
 ek ore satyarth prakaash kaa gambheer adhyayan va duusari ore swami somdev ke saath raajnneetik vishyon par khuli charchaa se unke man main desh-prem kii bhaavana jaagrit hui
 At the Congress session of 1916, when Ramprasad took out the procession of Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak in the entire Lucknow city, while disguising the order of the late Pt
 adhiveshan ke dauraan unka parichay keshav baliram headgavar, somdev sharma va mukundilal aadi se hua
 Later these same Somdev Sharma along with some Siddhagopal Shukla also published a book from the Nagari Sahitya Library, Kanpur titled - History of American Independence
 yah pustak babu ganeshprasad ke prabandh se kurmi press, lakhanu main san 1916 main prakashit hui thi
 Ramprasad published this book from his mother with two hundred rupees in two times
 iskaa ullekh unhone apni aatmakatha main kiya he
 This book was confiscated as soon as it was printed and later when the Kakori case was prosecuted, this book was presented as evidence
 ab yah pustak sampadit karke sarfaroshi kii tamanna naamak granthavali ke bhaag-teen main sankalit kii ja chuki he or teen murti bhawan pustkaalay, nai-dilli sahit kai anya pustakaalayon main dekhi ja sakati he
 On hearing the news of the hanging of Bhai Parmanand in 1915, Ramprasad had pledged to destroy the British Empire, a book had come out in 1916, some young men had joined him, they had also received the blessings of Swami Somdev
 ek sanghathan unhone pan gendaalal dikshit ke maargdarshan main matruvedi ke naam se khud khadaa kar liya tha
 a commercial and a pledge were also published on behalf of this organization

 In the Congress session held in front of the Red Fort in Delhi from 26 to 31 December 1918, the youth of this organization started selling books as they screamed that the police raided but all the books were saved due to Bismil's understanding
 pandit gendaalal dikshit kaa janm yamuna kinare sthit may gaanv main hua tha
 He was a teacher in the DAV school of Auraiya, a famous town in Etawah district
 deshbhakti kaa junun savaar hua to shivaji samiti ke naam se ek sanstha bana lee or hathiyaar ekatra karne shuru kar diye
 He was caught bringing weapons to Agra
 kile main kaid the vahaan se police ko chakma dekar rafuchakkar ho gayi
 After the merger of Bismil's maternal institution with the Shivaji Committee, the two worked together
 ek baar pun: pakade gayi, police peeche padi thi, bhaag kar dilli chale gayi jahaan unka praanant hua
 Bismil has given a very touching description of Pandit Gendalal ji in his autobiography
 mainpuri shadyantra main shahjahanpur se 6 yuvak shaamil hue the jinke leader ramprasad bismil the kintu ve police ke haath nahin aaye, tatkaal faraar ho gayi
 On 1 November 1919, Magistrate b s Chris pronounced the Mainpuri conspiracy
 jin-jin ko sajaayen huin unamem mukundilal ke alaava sabhi ko farvari 1920 main aam maafee ke elaan main chhod diya gaya
 Bismil remained underground for the entire 2 years
 unke dal ke hi kuch saathiyon ne shahjahanpur main jaakar yah afvaah failaa di ki bhai ramprasad to police kii goli se maare gayi jabaki sachai yah thi ki ve police muthbhed ke dauraan yamuna main chalaang lagaakar pani ke andar hi andar yogabhyas kii shakti se tairte hue milon dur aage jaakar nadi se baahar nikle or jahaan aajkal greater noida aabaad ho chukaa he vahaan ke nirjan bihadon main chale gayi
 There used to be only acacia trees in those days; And the man did not appear anywhere in the desert
 ram prasad bismil ne yahan ke ek chote se gaanv rampur jaagir main sharan lee or kai maheene yahan ke nirjan jangalon main ghoomte hue gaanv ke gujaron kii gaay bhens charaayi
 He has described this very interestingly in the second volume of his autobiography: Swadesh Prem
 yaheen rahakar unhone apana krantikari upanyaas bolshevikon kii karatuut likhaa
 In fact, this novel is originally a Hindi-translation of the book nihilist-rahasya written in Bangla language, whose language and style are both very interesting
 aravind ghosh kii ek ati uttam bangla pustak yogic saadhan kaa hindi - anuwaad bhi unhone bhumigat rahete hue hi kiya tha
 In those days, the land on the banks of Yamuna was considered safe to escape from the police, so Bismil made full use of that safe place
 vartmaan samay main yah gaanv chunki greater noida ke beta van sector ke antargat aata he at: uttar pradesh sarkaar ne rampur jaagir gaanv ke kshetra main aane vaali van vibhaag kii arakshit bhoomi par unki smriti main amar shahid pan ram prasad bismil udyaan viksit kar diya he jisaki dekharekh greater noida prashasan ke vitt-poshan se pradesh kaa van vibhaag karata he
 a feature of 'bismil' was also that they did not stay at any place for long
 kuch din rampur jaagir main rahakar apni sagi bahan shastri devi ke gaanv kosma jila mainpuri main bhi rahe
 Interestingly, even his own sister could not recognize him
 kosma se chalakar bah pahunche
 After a few days, then from Pinhat, Agra, went to his grandfather's village Barabai in the princely state of Gwalior
 unhone vahaan kisaan ke bhes main rahakar kuch dinon hal bhi chalaaya
 While living in exile, he translated the English book The Grandmother of Russian Revolution published in 1918 in Hindi
 unke sabhi saathiyon ko yah pustak bahut pasand aayi
 He named this book Catharine

 Apart from the indigenous color, all three books are available in the libraries for common readers nowadays

 In the business he earned both Naam and Naama
 congress jila samiti ne unhen lekha pareekshak ke pad par kaaryakari cameti main le liya
 In September 1920, he joined the Calcutta Congress as an authorized representative of the Shahjahanpur Congress Committee
 kalkatte main unki bhent lala lajpat raay se hui
 When Lala ji saw the books written by him, he was very impressed with them
 unhone unka parichay kalakatta ke kuch prakashkon se kara diya jinamein ek umadutt sharma bhi the, jinhone aage chalakar san 1922 main ram prasad bismil kii ek pustak catherine chhaapi thi
 At the Ahmedabad Congress Session of 1921, Ramprasad 'bismil' openly supported Maulana Hasrat Mohani on the proposal of Purna Swaraj and finally got Gandhiji to pass a resolution to start the non-cooperation Movement
 is kaaran ve yuvaaon main kaaphi lokapriy ho gayi
 The volunteers of Shahjahanpur played an important role in starting the non-cooperation movement throughout the country
 kintu 1922 main jab chaurichaura kand ke pashchaat kisi se paraamarsh kiye bina gandhi ji ne asahyog aandolan waapas le liya to 1922 kii gaya congress main bismil va unke saathiyon ne gandhi ji kaa aisa virodh kiya ki congress main phir do vichaardhaarayen ban gayin - ek udaaravaadi yaa libral or duusari vidrohi yaa rebelion
 Gandhi always used to call the young men of rebellious ideology in the Congress general meetings due to their opposition
 ek baar to unhone jawaharlal nehru ko patr likhakar krantikari navayuvakon kaa saath dene par buree tarah fatkaar bhi lagaayi thi
 In January 1923, wealthy people like Motilal Nehru and Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das formed a Swaraj Party
 navayuvakon ne tadarth party ke rup main revolutionari party kaa elaan kar diya
 In the special Congress session of Delhi held in September 1923, the disgruntled youths decided that they too would start interfering in politics by fixing their party's name and constitution etc
 Otherwise the loot system would dominate in the name of democracy in the country
 dekha jaye to us samay unki yah badi doordarshee soch thi
 The well-known revolutionary Lala Hardayal, who was working in those days to strategize to free India from abroad, was in contact with Ram Prasad Bismil since the time of Swami Somdev
 lala ji ne hi patr likhakar ram prasad bismil ko shachindranath sanyaal va yadu gopal mukherjee se milakar nayi party kaa samvidhan taiyaar karne kii salaah di thi
 Following the advice of Lala ji, Ram Prasad went to Allahabad and prepared the party's constitution at Shachindranath Sanyal's house
 navgathit party kaa naam sankshep main ech aar e rakhaa gaya va iskaa samvidhan pile rang ke parche par chhap karke sadasyon ko bheja gaya
 On 3 October 1924, an executive-meeting of this party was held in Kanpur, in which many prominent members of Shachindranath Sanyal, Yogesh Chandra Chatterjee and Ram Prasad Bismil etc
 attended
 is baithak main party kaa netritv bismil ko saunpkar sanyaal va chatarji bengal chale gayi
 Due to the difficulty of collecting funds for the party, the method of revolutionaries of Ireland was adopted and the first robbery was committed by the party in Bamrauli on 25 December 1924, which was efficiently led by Bismil
 iskaa ullekh chif court of avadh ke faisle main miltaa he
 Ram Prasad Bismil, in the 4-page pamphlet "the Revolutionary", published by the revolutionary party from an anonymous place on 1 January 1925 and distributed to all major places throughout India between 28 and 31 January 1925, under the pseudonym Vijay Kumar While disclosing in writing in writing the party's ideology, it was declared in clear terms that what kind of change in the governance system of this country's revolutionary Want to run and what can they do for it? Not only this, while mocking Gandhi's policies, he also asked why the person who calls himself spiritual is afraid to talk openly to the British
 He had given an open call to all the youth of India to join the revolutionary party by advising such pseudo-mahatma not to fall under the influence of the British
 di revolutionari ke naam se angreji main prakashit is krantikari main krantikariyon ke vaicharik chintan* ko bhalee-bhanti samajha ja saktaa he
 The infamous Hindi poetry of this paper is now also available on Hindi Wikisource
 di revolutionari naam se prakashit is 4 prishthiya ghoshnaptr ko dekhte hi british sarkaar iske lekhak ko bengal main khojane lagi
 Incidentally, Shachindra Nath Sanyal was arrested in Bankura when he was going to post this manifesto to a colleague
 isi prakaar yogeshchandra chatarji kanpur se party kii meeting karke jaise hi haavda stesan par train se utre ki ech aar e ke samvidhan kii dher sari pratiyon ke saath pakad liye gayi
 He was imprisoned in Hazaribagh jail
 donon pramukh netaaon ke giraftaar ho jane se ram prasad bismil ke kandhon par uttar pradesh ke saath-saath bengal ke krantikari sadasyon kaa uttardaayitv bhi aa gaya
 Bismil's nature was that he either did not take any work in hand and once he took the task in hand, he would not leave it without completing it
 party ke kaary hetu dhan kii aavashyaktaa pehle bhi thi kintu ab to or bhi adhik bad gayi thi
 Seeing that money was not received from anywhere, he committed two political dacoities on 7 March 1925 in Bichpuri and on 24 May 1925 in Dwarkapur
 parantu unhen unamem kuch vishesh dhan praapt nahin ho sakaa
 In these two robberies, one person was killed on the spot
 isse bismil kii aatma ko apaar ksht hua
 Finally, he made sure that he would now only loot the state treasury, not to rob the house of any of the nobles of India
 shahjahanpur main unke ghar par 7 agast 1925 ko hui ek immergency meeting main nirnay lekar yojana bani or 9 agast 1925 ko shahjahanpur railway stesan se bismil ke netritv main kul 10 log, jinamein ashfak ulla khan, rajendra lahidi, chandrasekhar aaazaad, shachindranath bakshi, manmathanath gupt, mukundi laal, keshav chakravarti, murari sharma tathaa banavaari laal shaamil the, 8 down saharanpur-lakhanu paisanger railgadee main savaar hue
 In addition to the pistols, all of them had four German-made Mauser pistols, with a butt in the butt that looked like a small automatic rifle and caused fear in the front
 in moujaron kii maarak kshamta bhi saadhaaran pistolon se adhik hoti thi
 In those days, these mausers were known like today's A-47 rifles
 lakhanu se pehle kakori railway stesan par ruk kar jaise hi gaadi aage badi, krantikariyon ne chen khinchakar use roak liya or guard ke dibbe se sarkari khajaane kaa baksaa neeche gira diya
 An attempt was made to open it but when it did not open, Ashfaq Ulla Khan grabbed his master Manmath Nath Gupt and took the hammer and broke the box
 manmathanath gupt ne utsukathavash moujar kaa trigar dabaa diya jisase chhuti goli ahamed ali naam ke musafir ko lag gayi
 He piled on the spot
 shighratavash chaandi ke sikkon va noton se bhare chamade ke thile chaadaron main baandhakar vahaan se bhaagane main ek chadar vahiin chhot gayi
 The next day this news spread through the newspapers through the whole world
 british sarkaar ne is train dakaiti ko gambheertha se liya or di ai ji ke sahaayak mistar aar e harton ke netritv main scotland kii sabase tej tarraar police ko isaki jaanch kaa kaam saunp diya
 The CID, after a serious investigation, confirmed to the government that the Kakori train robbery is a planned conspiracy by the revolutionaries
 police ne kakori kand ke sambandh main jaankaree dene va shadyantr main shaamil kisi bhi vyakti ko giraftaar karwaane ke liye inaam kii ghoshnaa ke vigyaapan sabhi pramukh sthanon par laga diye
 As a result of this, the police found that the sheet was found by someone from Shahjahanpur only because of the washer's mark on the sheet found at the scene
 shahjahanpur ke dhobiyon se poochne par maaloom hua ki chadar banarsi laal kii he
 The police obtained all the distinction by meeting Banarsi Lal
 yah bhi pataa chal gaya ki 9 agast 1925 ko shahjahanpur se uski party ke koun-koun log shahar se baahar gayi the or ve kab-kab waapas aaye? jab khufia taur se is baat kii pushti ho gayi ki ram prasad bismil, jo ech aar e kaa leader tha, us din shahar main nahin tha to 26 sitambar 1925 kii raat main bismil ke saath samooche hindustan se 40 se bhi adhik logon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Only 10 people actually participated in the Kakori case, so all of them were nominated
 inamen se paanch - chandrasekhar aaazaad, murari sharma, keshav chakravarti, ashfak ulla khan va shacheendra nath bakshi ko chhodkar, jo police ke haath nahin aaye, shesh sabhi vyaktiyon par abhiyog chalaa or unhen 5 varsh kii kaid se lekar phaansi tak kii sajaa sunaayi gayi
 Apart from the absconding accused, 16 of the revolutionaries who were arrested on suspicion of being active activists of H
R
A
 were released
 special magistrate anuddin ne prayek krantikari kii chhabi kharaab karne main koi kasar baaki nahin rakkhi
 Not only this, before sending the case to the sessions court, all the witnesses and evidence were collected so that even if an appeal is made, not a single accused should be released without conviction
 banarsi laal ko hawalat main hi police ne kadi sajaa kaa bhay dikhaakar tod liya
 In the Shahjahanpur District Congress Committee, this Banarasi had a fight with Bismil over the party fund
 bismil ne, jo us samay jila congress cameti ke auditor the, banarsi par party-fund main gaban kaa aarope siddh karte hue use congress party kii praathmik sadsyta se nilambit kar diya tha
 Later, when Gandhiji came to Shahjahanpur on 16 October 1920, Banarasi met him and made his stand
 gandhi ji ne us samay yah kahkar ki choti-moti hera-pheri ko itnaa tool nahin dena chaiye, in donon main sulah kara di
 But Banarsi was a very sly man
 usne pehle to bismil se maafee maang lee phir gandhi ji ko alag le jaakar unke kaan bhar diye ki ramprasad bada hi apradhi kism kaa vyakti he
 They neither believe anything about it nor allow anyone else to do it
 aage chalakar isi banarsi laal ne bismil se mitrataa kar lee or mithi-mithi baton se pehle unka vishwaas arjeet kiya or uske baad unke saath kapade ke vyapaar main saajheedaar ban gaya
 When Bismil formed his own party criticizing Gandhiji, Banarasi Lal was overjoyed and kept quiet in search of an opportunity
 police ne sthaneey logon se bismil va banarsi ke pichley jhagade kaa bhed jaanakar hi banarsi laal ko apruvar banaaya or bismil ke viruddh puure abhiyog main ek achook aujaar kii tarah istemaal kiya
 Banarasi Lal, being a partner in trade, knew such secret things related to the party, which no one but Bismil could have known
 iskaa ullekh ram prasad bismil ne apni aatmakatha main kiya he
 The 11 district barracks of the Lucknow District Jail, which was then called the Central Jail of the United Provinces, housed all the revolutionaries together and built a temporary court in a luxurious building called Ring Theater near Hazratganj intersection
 ring theatre naam kii yah building kothi hayaat baksh or mallika ahad mahal ke bich hua karti thi jisamen british afasar aakar film va naatak aadi dekhakar manoranjan kiya karte the
 In the same ring theater for 18 consecutive months, the British government spent 10 lakh rupees when the value of gold used to be 20 rupees in a historic trial in the name of King Imperial Versus Ram Prasad 'bismil' and Others
 british hukmaranon ke aadesh se yah building bhi baad main dhaha di gayi or uski jagah san 1929-1932 main ji pi o lakhanu ke naam se ek doosraa bhavy bhawan bana diya gaya
 When India became independent in 1947, the Nehru government completed the true task of installing a grand statue of Gandhiji here
 jab kendra main gaiyr congresi janata sarkaar kaa pehali baar gathan hua to us samay ke jivit krantikariyon ke samuhik prayaason se san 1977 main yojit kakori shahid ardhshtabdi samaaroh ke samay yahan par kakori stambh kaa anaavaran uttar pradesh ke rajyapal ganapatirav devrao tapaase ne kiya taaki us sthal kii smriti bani rahe
 In this landmark case, Harkarnanath Mishra was appointed as the lawyer of the revolutionaries from government expenditure, while Jagatnarayan 'mulla', a well-known lawyer in relation to Jawaharlal Nehru, was made a government lawyer under a thoughtful strategy
 jagat narayan ne apni ore se sabhi krantikariyon ko kadi se kadi sajaa dilwane main koi kasar baaki na rakkhi
 It was the same Jagat Narayan against whose will Bismil organized a grand procession of Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak in the entire city of Lucknow in 1916
 isi baat se chidh kar mainpuri shadyantra main bhi inhen mullaji ne sarkari vakil kii haisiyat se kaaphi jor lagaaya parantu ve ram prasad bismil kaa ek bhi bal bankaa na kar paye kyonki mainpuri shadyantra main bismil faraar ho gayi the or do saal tak police ke haath hi na aaye
 On 6 April 1927, Special Sessions Judge A
 Hamilton, in a 115-page decision, considering the charges leveled against each revolutionary, wrote that this was not a simple train robbery, but a planned conspiracy to overthrow the British Empire
 haalaanki inamen se koi bhi abhiyukt apane vyaktigat laabh ke liye is yojana main shaamil nahin hua parantu chunki kisi ne bhi na to apane kiye par koi pashchaatap kiya he or na hi bhavishya main is prakaar kii gatividhiyon se swayan ko alag rakhane kaa vachan diya he atah jo bhi sajaa di gayi he soch samaj kar di gayi he or is haalat main usamen kisi bhi prakaar kii koi chhot nahin di ja sakati
 However, if any of these accused expresses remorse in writing and pledges not to do so in future, the Upper Court may consider their appeal
 faraar krantikariyon main ashfak ulla khan or shacheendra nath bakshi ko bahut baad main police giraftaar kar paayi
 An additional case of Kakori conspiracy was filed in the court of Special Judge J
 R
 Bennett and on 13 July 1927, Ashfaq Ullah Khan was hanged and sentenced to life imprisonment to Shachindranath Bakshi, repeating the same thing
 seshan jaj ke faisle ke khilaaf 18 july 1927 ko avadh chif court main apil daayar kii gayi
 Both cases appeared before the Chief Justice of the Chief Court, Sir Louis Schutt and Special Judge Mohammad Raza
 jagatnarayan 'mullah' ko sarkari paksh rakhane kaa kaam saunpa gaya jabaki sajayaftaa krantikariyon kii ore se ke si dutt, jayakarannath mishra va kripashankar hajela ne kramshah rajendra nath lahidi, thakur roshan singh va ashfak ulla khan kii pairvi kii
 Ram Prasad Bismil made his own defense because at the government expense he was given a big simple lawyer named Laxmishankar Mishra, which he refused to take
 bismil ne chif court ke saamne jab dharapravaah angreji main faisle ke khilaaf bahes kii to sarkari vakil mullah ji baglein jhaankate najar aaye
 On this reasoning ability of Bismil, Chief Justice Louis Shurtas had to ask him - "mr
 Ramprasad! From which university you have taken the degree of law?" At this he laughed and said- "excuse me sir! a kingmaker did not require Anne's degree
" " adaalat ne is jawaab se chidhkar bismil dwaara 18 july 1927 ko di gayi swayan vakaalat karne kii arji khaarij kar di
 He then presented a 76-page argumentative written debate
 use pard kar jajon ne yah shankaa vyakt kii ki yah bahes bismil ne swayan na likhakar kisi vidhivetta se likhvai he
 Ultimately, the court allowed the same Laxmishankar Mishra to argue, which Bismil refused to take
 kakori kand kaa mukadmaa lakhanu main chal rahaa tha
 Pandit Jagatnarayan Mulla was a poet of Urdu along with the government lawyer
 unhone abhiyukton ke liye "muljiman" kii jagah "mulajim" shabd bol diya
 What was it then, Pandit Ram Prasad 'bismil' blatantly lashed out at him with a sarcasm: "don't tell me, mooljim, we are very sorry; we have brought it here with the help of the court
" palat dete hai ham mauje-hawadis apni jurrat se; ki hamane aandhiyon main bhi chiraag aksar jalaaye hai
 "he meant that he is not a servant, but a mullah who earns salaries from the government
 ve to raajnneetik bandi hai at: unke saath tameez se pesh aayen
 Along with this he also warned that they have the power to reverse even the waves of the sea with their audacity; What is the big deal to overturn the case? Who dared after speaking so much that would have stayed in front of Bismil
 mullah ji ko paseene chhot gayi or unhone kanni kaatane main hi bhalaai samajhi
 They quietly slipped through the back door
 phir us din unhone koi jirah nahin kii
 All the revolutionaries, except Shachindra Nath Sanyal, Bhupendra Nath Sanyal and Banwari Lal, appealed in the Chief Court
 22 agast 1927 ko jo faisla sunaaya gaya uske anusaar ram prasad bismil, rajendra nath lahidi va ashfak ulla khan ko ai pi si kii dfa 121 va 120 ke antargat aaajeevan karawas tathaa 302 va 396 ke anusaar phaansi evam thakur roshan singh ko pehali do dfaaon main 5+5 = kul 10 varsh kii kadi kaid tathaa agali do dfaaon ke anusaar phaansi kaa hukum hua
 Shachindra Nath Sanyal, while in jail, had expressed his remorse in writing and had pledged not to take part in any future revolutionary action
 iske aadhaar par unki umr-kaid barkaraar rahi
 Shachindra's younger brothers Bhupendra Nath Sanyal and Banwari Lal had confessed to their crime and had already given the undertaking to face any punishment of the court, so they did not appeal and the order for imprisonment of 5-5 years remained unchanged
 chif court main apil karne ke baavjood yogeshchandra chatarji, mukundi laal va govindcharan car kii sajaayen 10-10 varsh se badhaakar umr-kaid main badal di gayin
 The decorations of Suresh Chandra Bhattacharya and Vishnusharan Dublish also remained the same
 khubasurat handriting main likhakar apil dene ke kaaran keval pranavesh chatarji kii sajaa ko 5 varsh se ghataakar 4 varsh kar diya gaya
 Ramnath Pandey was the least punished in this case
 manmathanath gupt, jinaki goli se musafir maaraa gaya, kii sajaa 10 se badhaakar 14 varsh kar di gayi
 Since the cartridges of the Mauser pistol used in the Kakori case were purchased on the arms license of Premkrishna Khanna, due to sufficient evidence, Premkrishna Khanna was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment of 5 years
 chif court kaa faisla aate hi samooche desh main sansani fail gayi
 Thakur Manjit Singh Rathore informed the Central Legislative Council to submit a proposal to convert all the hanged prisoners of Kakori case to life imprisonment
 kauncil ke kai sadasyon ne sar wiliam moris ko, jo us samay sanyukt praant ke governor the, is aashay kaa ek prarthana-patr bhi diya kintu unhone use asweekaar kar diya
 78 members of the Central Council sent the then Viceroy and Governor General Edward Frederick Lindley Wood with a signed memorial in Shimla, prominently Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, NC Kelkar, Lala Lajpat Rai, Govind Vallabh Pant , Etc
 had signed but they had no effect on the Viceroy

 The Chief Court in its decision also wrote this matter
 iske baavjood vysarai ne unhen saaf manaa kar diya
 Finally, barrister Mohan Lal Saxena prepared and sent the documents for clemency petition in the Privy Council to England's renowned lawyer SL Polak
 parantu landan ke nyaayadhishon va samraat ke vaidhanik salaahkaaron ne us par badi sakht daleel di ki is shadyantr kaa sutaradhar ram prasad bismil bada hi khatarnaak or peshewar apradhi he
 If he is granted pardon, he can commit a bigger and more terrible scandal in future
 us sthiti main sarkaar ko hindustan main shashan karnaa asambhav ho jaayegaa
 The result of all this was that the appeal for clemency sent to the Privy Council was also rejected
 16 disambar 1927 ko bismil ne apni aatmakatha kaa aakhri adhyay purna karke jail se baahar bhijwa diya
 Last met the parents on 18 December 1927 and on Monday 19 December 1927, they were hanged in the District Jail of Gorakhpur at 6
30 AM
 bismil ke balidaan kaa samachar sunakar bahut badi sankhya main janata jail ke phatak par ekatra ho gayi

Standing on the gallows, you said - 'I wish the downfall of the British Empire! That is, i want the fall of the British Empire!' After this the lion said - 'now there are neither Ahle-valvle nor the crowd of arrogance, the desire to eradicate one is now in the heart! Then prayed to God and started reading a mantra
