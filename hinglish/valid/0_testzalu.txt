818 lokkathaon ke anusaar, raja patrak ko patna kaa janak kaha jaataa he, jisane apni rani patli ke liye jaadu se is nagar kaa nirmaan kiya
 That is why the city was named Pataligram
 patliputra naam bhi isi ke kaaran padaa
 In Sanskrit, son means son or son and village means village
 puratathvik anusandhano ke anusaar patna kaa itihaas 490 isa purv se hota he jab haryak vansh ke shaasha ajatshatru ne apni rajdhani rajgrih se badalakar yahaan sthapit kii, kyonki vaishali ke lichchhaviyon se sangharsh main upyukt hone ke kaaran patliputra rajgrih kii apeksha samrik drushti se adhik ranneetik sthaan par tha
 He chose this place on the banks of the Ganges and established Apama Durg
 us samay se hi is nagar kaa lagaataar itihaas rahaa he - aisa gaurav duniya ke bahut kam nagaron ko hasil he
 Gautama Buddha, the originator of Buddhism, passed through here in his last days
 unhone ye bhavishyavaanee kii thi ki nagar kaa bhavishya ujjwal hoga, par kabhi baadh, aag yaa aapasi sangharsh ke kaaran yah barbaad ho jayega
 Pataliputra became the center of power after the rise of the Maurya Empire
 chandragupta maury kaa samrajya bengal kii khadi se afghanistan tak fail gaya tha
 The early Pataliputra was made of wood, but Emperor Ashoka transformed the city into a stone structure
 china ke phahiyaan ne, jo ki san 399-414 tak bharat yatra par tha, apane yatra-vrutant main yahaan ke shail sanrachanaon kaa jivant varnan kiya he
 Megasthenes, who came to the court of Chandragupta Maurya, a Greek historian and an ambassador, gave the first written account of the city of Pataliputra
 gyaan kii khoj main, baad main kai chini yatri yahaan aae or unhone bhi yahaan ke bare main, apane yatra-vrutanton main likhaa he
 After this, the city was ruled by several dynasties
 in raajaaon ne yaheen se bhartiya upmahadweep par shashan kiya
 The reign of the Gupta dynasty is called the Golden Age of Ancient India
 par iske baad nagar ko vah gairav nahin mil paaya jo ek samay maury vansh ke samay praapt tha
 Patna's future remained quite uncertain after the fall of the Gupta Empire
 12 veen sadi main baktiyaar khilji ne bihar par apana adhipaty jamaa liya or kai aadhyatmik pratishthanon ko dhwast kar daalaa
 Patna was no longer the cultural and political center of the country
 mughalkaal main dilli ke sattadhariyon ne yahaan apana niyantran banaae rakhaa
 The best time in this period came when Sher Shah Suri tried to revive the city
 usne ganga ke tir par ek kila banane kii sochi
 There is no fort built for him yet, but there is still a mosque built in the Afghan style
 mughal badshaah akbar 1574 main afagaan sargana daud khan ko kuchalane patna aayaa
 Akbar's state secretary and Ain Akbari author described the place as an industrial center full of paper, stone and glass
 patna rice ke naam se europe main prasiddh chaaval ke vibhinn naslon kii gunvattta kaa ullekh bhi in vivaranon main miltaa he
 The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, at the request of his beloved grandson Muhammad Azeem, renamed the city Azimabad in 1704
 azeem us samay patna kaa soobedaar tha
 But in this period, there was no special change in Patna except for the name
 mughal samrajya ke patan ke saath hi patna bengal ke nababon ke shasnadhin ho gaya jinhone is kshetra par baari kar lagaaya par ise vanijyik kendra bane rahane kii chhot di
 Patna became the center of international trade in the 17th century
 angrezon ne 1620 main yahaan resham tathaa kelico ke vyapaar ke liye yahaan factory kholi
 Soon it became the center of Salt Peter's trade, which intensified competition from the French and Dutch people
 baxur ke nirnaayak yuddh ke baad nagar east india company ke adheen chalaa gaya or vaanijya kaa kendra bana rahaa
 After the partition of Bengal in 1912, Patna became the capital of Orissa and Bihar
 It soon emerged as an important and strategic centre
 a number of imposing structures were constructed by the British
 Credit for designing the massive and majestic buildings of colonial Patna goes to the architect, I
 F
 Munnings
 Most of these buildings reflect either indo-saracenic influence, or overt Renaissance influence like the Raj Bhawan and the High Court
 Some buildings, like the General Post Office and the Old Secretariat bear pseudo-renaissance influence
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki patna ke nae bhawanon ke nirmaan main hasil hui maharath dilli ke shasnic kshetra ke nirmaan main bahut kaam ai
 Patna also has many prestigious educational institutions
 There are several prestigious educational institutions in Patna like Patna College, Patna Women's College, Patna Science college,bihar National college,bihar College of Engineering, Patna Medical College, Nalanda Medical College, Patna Dental College and the Patna Veterinary College
 Orissa was carved out of Bihar in 1935 and made a state
 patna rajya kii rajdhani bana rahaa
 The city played an important role in the Indian freedom struggle
 nil kii kheti ke liye champaran kaa aandolan tathaa 1942 kaa bharat chodo aandolan inamen se kuch ullekhneey naam he
 Patna remained the capital of Bihar after independence
 2000 main jharkhand rajya ke banane ke baad abhi tak yah bihar kii rajdhani he
 Pataliputra, the capital of the Magadha Empire

 vineet kumaar singh, zoya hossain, jimi shergill tathaa ravi kishan film main mukhya bhoomikaaon main hai
 The story of the film itself is written by Anurag Kashyap along with Vineet Kumar Singh, Mukti Singh Srinet, KD Satyam, Ranjan Chandel and Prasoon Mishra
 phantum films, reliance intertenment tathaa color yelo productions ke binar tale bani is film ke nirmaataa anand el raay, vikramaditya motwane, madhu mantena tathaa anuraag kashyap he
 The film's story revolves around Shravan Singh, a low-caste boxer, who is constantly struggling to establish his identity in the boxing world
 film kii kahani vineet kumaar singh ne 2013 main mukti singh shrinet ke saath milakar likhi thi
 After this he went to several producers with his story, but they all refused to work on it
 july 2017 main ghoshnaa hui thi ki anuraag kashyap anand el raay ke saath milakar mukkaabaz naamak ek film par kaam karenge
 Anurag rewrote the film's story again
 film kii shooting bareli, lakhanu tathaa varanasi main 2017 main hui
 The film's story is set in Uttar Pradesh's Bareilly district
 7 july 2017 ko film kaa 21 second lambaa audio tizar jari kiya gaya, or phir 7 disambar 2017 ko film kaa aadhikarik poster tathaa trailor jari kiya gaya

 Shravan Singh is a true and honest boxer who someday wants to become a world famous boxer
 aisa karne ke prayaason main, shravan kaa saamana aksar bhagwaan das mishra se hota rahata he, jo ek sthaneey don he, or saath hi saath rajya mukkebaaji sangh kaa pramukh bhi
 Lord Mishra keeps Shravan engaged in domestic chores and other sporadic tasks instead of boxing training
 aakhirkaar, un donon ke madhya yuddh jaisi sthiti samay utpann ho jaati he, jab shravan bhagwaan mishra kii bhatiji, sunaina mishra ke pyaar main pad jaataa he
 Further story is about Shravan's struggles to fulfill his motives, and to win his love while facing the political atmosphere of Uttar Pradesh and the corruption and ethnicity prevailing in the boxing federation
 is film kaa vichaar sarvapratham abhinayta vineet kumaar singh ko aayaa, jinhone system kii khaamiyon kii vajah se asafal rahe khilaadiyon ke bare main kahaniyaan likhnaa shuru kiya
 In 2013, he co-wrote a story with Mukti Singh Srinet and then started searching for the makers for his story
 singh apni kahani lekar kai nirmaataaon ke paas gaye, parantu un sab ne is par kaam karne se manaa kar diya, kyonki singh kii shart thi, ki agar unki kahani par film banati he, to vah swayan mukhya bhoomika nibhaayenge
 Eventually, Anurag Kashyap came to know about Vineet about the film one day, with whom he had previously worked in Gangs of Vasaipur, Bombay Talkies and Ugly films
 kashyap ko yah kahani 1976 kii film rocky jaisi lagi, or phir unhone is film ke liye swayan shodh karnaa shuru kiya
 This was followed by a formal announcement in July 2017 that Anurag Kashyap would collaborate with Anand L
 Rai on a film called Mukkabaaz
 kashyap ke anusaar, mukkebaaz narsingh pancham yadav ke maamle ne unhen film ke liye prerit kiya, jis par 2016 rio olympic ke dauraan doping kaa aarope laga tha
 Kashyap chose him for the main character as per Vineet Kumar Singh's condition, but asked him to take training for this role
 singh ne apni training kii shuruyaat mumbai se kii, jahaan unhone boxing coach anudeep singh se ek saal tak mukkebaaji kaa prashikshan liya
 During this period, Singh never told his coach that he was taking this training for the role of a film
 iske baad vah patiala gaye, jahaan unhone rashtriya krida santhaan main vaastavik mukkebaazon ke saath training lee
 The film is the first film by Delhi theater actress Zoya Hussain
 anuraag kashyap ne unki laghu film thri and half tex dekhi thi, jisase prabhavit hokar unhone hossain ko sunaina mishra ke kirdaar ke liye chunaa
 For his role as a dumb girl, Hussain spent several months learning non-verbal language and character behavior
 film kii shooting may 2017 main bareli, lakhanu tathaa varanasi main hui
 Kashyap sent his second unit director, Saqib Pandar, to record the boxing tournament on camera, and used all of the actual contests recorded on camera in a state tournament scene shown in the film
 isi samay uttar bharat main ek vaastavik mukkebaaji toornament main bhaag lene ke baad unhone yah bhi mahasoos kiya ki kuch sattadhin logon ke alaava in pratiyogitaaon main koi darshak nahin tha, jo yah faisla karte hai ki kis boxr ko kis rajya kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa chahie, or kise nahin
 These stories were then also used to write the plot of the film
 film kii shooting main kisi bhi mukkebaaji koreographer yaa ection diarector kii sahaayta nahin lee gai
 The story of the film is set in Bareilly district of Uttar Pradesh, and is inspired by a true story
 film main sangeet newcleiya, rachita aroda or vineet kumaar singh ne diya he, or geet hossain hydari, vineet kumaar singh or doctor sunil jogi ne likhe hai

 The song "panthera" is composed by Nucleya
 kashyap ko base sangeet se bharaa ek hindi rap geet chahie tha, or iske liye unke saare pichley prayaas rahe the
 According to Nucleya, Anurag Kashyap had approached him for this song through Amit Trivedi

 Stereolithography is a form of additive manufacturing technology used to create models, prototypes, patterns, and the use of parts produced in a layer by layer fashion to cause photo polymerization, the formation of light, chains of molecules to link together
 a process by polymers
 Research in the field was conducted during the 1970s, but the period was coined by Charles W
 Hull in 1986
 He patented the process

 Stereolithography or "SLA" printing is an early and widely used 3D printing technique

 Technology first appeared as early as the 1970s
 japani shodhakarta da Hideo kodema pehle sahaj polimur kaa ilaaj karne ke liye parabangnee prakaash kaa upyog karke sterolithography karne ke liye aadhunik bahustareey drushtikon kaa avishkaar kiya
 However, the term "stereolithography" was coined in 1986 by Chuck Hull
 Chuck Plow patented stereolithography as a method of producing "thin" 3D objects of an object by sequentially using a medium treatment by ultraviolet light, starting from the bottom layer to the top layer
 hal ke patent ek taral tasviir bahulak se bharaa ek waite kii sataha par dhyaan kendrit parabangnee prakaash kaa ek kendrit beam kaa varnan kiya
 The UV light beam is focused on the surface of the liquid photo polymer, creating each layer of the desired 3D object through slant

 Attempts have been made to construct mathematical models of stereolithography processes and to design algorithms to determine whether a proposed object 3D printing experiment can be constructed
 sterolithography kaa ek tub karne par ek parabangnee dhyaan kendrit karke lager kaam karata he ki ek jodna vinirmaan prakriya he tasviir bahulak raal
 With the help of computer aided manufacturing or computer aided design software, the UV laser is used to draw a pre-programmed design or shape on the surface of photo polymer vat

 a complete 3D object can be formed using this process
 dizin to kisi bhi atirikt raal ko dur karne ke kram main ek rasinic snaan main duube or ek parabangnee oven main thik ho rahe hai
 To prevent stereolithography, the use of support structures that attach to the lift platform requires holding the cross sections in place to deflect gravity and resist lateral pressure from the resin-filled blades

 With more expensive stereolithography models, these supports must be manually removed from the finished product

 The length of time it takes to produce a part depends on the complexity of the design and size

 Many 3D printers can produce parts with a maximum size of approximately 50 × 50 × 60 cm, and some printers, such as the giant stereolithography machine, are capable of producing single parts more than 2 meters in length Huh

 Stereolithography can be used to produce almost any synthetic design, it is often expensive; Photo polymer resin can cost around $ 800 per gallon and SLA machines can cost $ 250,000

 balki sadguru kii krupa se ishwar kaa saakshaatkaar bhi sambhav he
 Nothing is possible in the absence of Guru's grace
 asadha maas kii poornima ko guru poornima kehete hai
 On this day, there is a law of Guru Puja
 guru poornima varsha ritu ke armbh main aati he
 For four months from this day, the saints and saints stay in one place and shed the Ganges of knowledge
 ye chaar maheene mausam kii drushti se bhi sarvshereshth hote hai
 Neither excess heat nor excess cold
 isliye adhyayan ke liye upyukt maane gaye hai
 Just as rain fed to the land heated by the heat of the sun and the power to produce crops, similarly the seekers present in the Guru-feet have the power to attain knowledge, peace, devotion and yoga power

 Premchand Award, Punjab Kala and Sahitya Academy Award, Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma Criticism Award, Acharya Niranjan Nath Distinguished Literary Award kahani sangrah Criticism suraj paliwal ke kahani sangrah kii bhoomika hindi ke charchit kathakaar sanjeev ne likhi he
 He propounded that Suraj Paliwal is an important ninth story narrator who outlined the reality of his time with political consciousness
 apni bhoomika main ve likhte hai- kritrimata se dur sahajata kii khoj main -apane daur ke samarth kathakaar suraj paliwal kii kahaniyaan pehle bhi padhata rahaa tha or aaj bhi, par chhitput padhanaa ek baat he, samgr padhanaa or baat
 By reading Suraj Paliwal's 'jungle and other stories' the first effect is of depression
 ek ajeeb-sa dhuaan aatma par tang jaataa he- khauf kaa dhuaan
 Will everything roll down like this on the slope of the heart? Never, will nothing change? Whether the story is 'shravan's Return' or 'ramraj', 'tomorrow's Happiness' or someone else, Suraj Paliwal does not forcibly give any hope of hope, but opens up the truths to the reader
 'shravan kii vaapasi' ko hi len, bhartiya kisaan pariwaron main ek adad gaay yaa bhens paalane kaa sapana 'godaan ke hori' se lekar aaj tak palata aa rahaa he or usee ke saath karj lekar lee gai is gaay yaa bhens kaa karj na chukaa paane kii vidmbana bhi
 a loan of three thousand rupees! Government debt for the landless The government's impose of debt on the buffalo's pit becomes the staple of Bapu's head and the craving for buffalo
 yah bhens na hui ji kaa janjaal ho gai
 Buffalo milk, yogurt, ghee was never BDO
 The peon would take away, sometimes the elder Babu, sometimes someone else
 na dene par kist kii dhamkee
 No member of the family finds buffalo milk-curd-ghee
 kist kii ladkati talwaar, bete kii berogari upar se
 There is no help from anywhere - neither from the relatives, nor from the relatives nor from the son
 antat karj na adaa kar paane kii sthiti main baapu ko jail hoti he
 Unemployed son cannot become hearing
 yah beete huye kal kii kahani he or aane vaale kal kii bhi
 The backdrop of Suraj Paliwal's stories are rural and urban conditions in Braj and its surroundings, poverty, hunger, villages thriving, village Pradhani elections, battles and clashes of caste dominance in casteist tightness, maneuvers and equations Huh
 inhen ke chalate gaanv main pul banane kii panchayat kii meeting bhandul ho jaati he
 Due to them, a few of the village's rich chamar vaccine is not allowed to become village head
 jaaton kaa praadhanya, brahmanon kii kootneeti ke kaaran jiti baaji bhi haar jaataa he tikaa
 The hypocrisy of the reality and generosity of the casteist village makes an accurate commentary on Brahminism
 'tikaa pradhan' agar varnbhed kii kahani he to 'ajanabi' vargabhed kii
 Despite being a Brahmin, poor Ramdhan, despite the good behavior of his unborn, but rich friend, does not cross the distance of class contrast
 aparichay kii yah diwaar bacchon tak khinchi hui he
 Once had read a story on this subject in 'kafila'
 lekhika thi malti mahavar
 Suraj Paliwal's 'stranger Identity' carries forward the story of the agony of the stories of Malati Mahawar and all the writers on classism
 yah pidaa ek ajeeb pidaa he, baahar se dikhti nahin, andar-hi-andar internal bleeding kii tarah tisati or risati rahati he, yatharth kaa prakshepan jitna aasaan hota he, sateek nishane tak pahunchnaa utana hi duhsadhay or isi main lekhak kii sachhee agnipariksha hoti he
 The situation becomes more troublesome when the whole society is becoming a victim of this heartbreak and the scope of recovery is not getting out from anywhere, all the while stealing the face of each other and getting the expulsion with the help of self-help shortcut
 Want to 'ravan tolaa' main ravan banane vaale karigar ko koi vaazib paisa dena nahin chahta
 Not just an artisan, all the artisans who work in hand and skill are ignored by the merchant society
 gaanv ke kaarigaron or cameron ke prati najariya ek-sa he
 Tereda is sad that he will give three rupees cash to the barber of the city and will talk like a guest, but the life goes out while giving it to the village tahlua
 phir ek dhoosar-sa satya yah he ki gaanv main paise hai hi nahin kisi ke paas
 That means not only the person, the whole village society is getting helpless in front of the city
 'ravan tolaa' kaa dhandha maaraa ja rahaa he
 More intangible than the enemy is tangible
 afvaah he ve badla lenge


 magar koun badla legaa or kisase? bazaarwaad or bhumandalikaran ke lambey saaye grasane vaale hai sab kuch, dhandhe, hunar, paramparaayen, samskruti
 There are stagnant conditions, stagnant people, everything seems to have frozen like a drying pond
 'ramraj' apane vyangyatmak sheershak se hi nahin, iske aage gramyajiwan main gahare utarkar gaanv ke bhrasht hote huye aadmi kii pradhani main hui jeet ke antarjaal kii bunaavat par ungali rakhti he
 Chaudhary Harpal Singh, a jawan who has run away from the army, does not indulge in theft, robbery, scams, but who wins the election
 suraj paliwal kii kahaniyaan gram-sabha, chunaav prashasan jaise sansnon ore naitik saahas jaise mulyon ke nirantar kamjor padate jane or antat vyarth hote jane kii daastaan bayaan karti hai
 Today, it is a period of neural tricks to cover up the lack of scripture with miraculous miracles and glittering language, but once the story itself was so strong, poignant and boring that it did not need any extra or effortless decoration
 'tomorrow's Happiness' is one such story, after which you remain depressed for a long time
 mushkil he, in sansthaaon ke nasht hone kaa ronaa ham kisase raayen, jabaki hamaari antim sharansthali parivaar or vivaah naam kii sanstha par bhi ab maaraatmak prahaar hone lage hai
 Somewhere they are broken, somewhere they are on the verge of breaking
 'kuch galat nahin' kahani main sangharkshil vidhur pita or chote bhai ke sapane, bade bete ke germany jate hi akaash chuumane lagate hai par jaisaa ki hota he, vargantarit bada betaa unhen puri tarah niraash karata he
 People destroy the story by making such stories, characters extroverted, Suraj Paliwal has transformed this story into a story of intertext and jeejivisha while protecting this story from danger
 sangharkshil pita, jo vidhur bhi he, kaa charitra is kahani main bahut shashakt dhang se ubharkar aayaa he
 The old father sits down, hurting the elder son but does not give up
 subah hal-bail lekar phir kheton par chal padate hai- 'ek saal fail hone par dobaaraa pariksha bhi to di jaati he
 "A Witness Death" is a memorial story of the lonely death of a dalit girl from a marginalized village
 'aaso' kaa pita bahadur tha, dalit hote huye bhi gaanv kii aan kii kai baar raksha kii thi usne, par duusare str par niyati or apane bholepan yaa morrkhtaa ke aage asahaay
 When Aso came back to maiden again plagued by her unhappy marital life, she was left as a child again, but the bravery and self-sufficiency of the father flows through her arteries - 'this society will change just like that son! Life can pass through the grace of others by wearing Sitarami, but what is called life, real life, he can live on his own by throwing Sitarami
 ' puure gaanv kii buaa, kabhi gaanv ke rakshak rahe bahadur pita kii bahadur beti aaso, kai dinon kii bhukhi, niraahaar do roti ke liye chillaati mar gai or gaanv dekhtaa rahaa
 Who is this son who changes in the stories of Sooraj Paliwal - sometimes by becoming an audience, sometimes by being a bhakta? None other is Suraj Paliwal himself! Their teenager! Often this teenager is sent to the city from his village or town to study but he does not feel like in the city
 yah kishor hindu bhi ho saktaa he or musalmaan bhi, savarna bhi or asavarna bhi, dhani bhi, garib bhi lekin hota he vah kishor, umr kii vah ganth jisase duniya ke aage ke kalle footte hai
 Even by living in the city, he lives the village - in nostalgia in memories
 aisa nahin he ki ye smritiyaan kisi sampann yaa samrudh at kii hai, balki zyaadaatar to us thahari hui jindagi ke tehre, sadate pani-si hi hai, kahin-kahin to aparaadh or aparaadhiki main lithdti hui, magar mitti ke matiyaale rang ke apane hi dhab hai, apni hi khushboo jo nihaayat apni-si he
 Even after living urban life for a long time, he remains an 'out cider' and a migrant
 is vikaas yaa viparyay kii intahaa kya he? suraj paliwal ke nayak-nayika shahar main umr kii lambii avadhi bitaakar bhi mukhute vaali dohari jindagi ke shahripan ko man-praan se sweekaar nahin kar pate
 He likes simple, easy, unnatural life
 beshakar rang-roganviheen yah cheharaa utana aakarshak or chakshush nahin he par chaliya to katai nahin
 The decision between the chaos often lingers on the threshold for a long time, but eventually he leans towards the simple, simple and unpretentious
 sahajata kii khoj hi sambhawatah kathakaar ko 'jangal' tak le aati he, jahaan sab kuch apane naiysargik rup main he- aadim or akrutrim prem bhi, ghrinaa bhi-'kulhadi se forest karmchaaree kii hatya kar police kii antaheen yantranaa sahane ke liye samarpan karne vaale adivasee kaa syah kaala rang or apmaan kii yantranaa se vikrut munh par tapati garm ankhen meraa peechha ab bhi kar rahi hai
 'sooraj Paliwal's three tales of tales are included in this composite - first, village stories, second, stories of strangeness even though the city, third, stories of relieving the alleged artificiality and reverting to their roots
 antim daur tak aate-aate uttar aadhuniktawaad, astitvvaad or duusare pashchimi katha andolanon kii prabhaav chhaayaayein bhi dikhne lagati hai
 Balization had not yet come, but the call of its hunter steps can be heard in these stories
 sankhya ke lihaaj se bahut kam kahaniyaan hai 'jangal tathaa anya kahaniyaan' samgr main
 Total deposit twenty eight
 suraj paliwal ke katha samgr se guzarane ke baad ek hi sawaal ubharta he- itane sambhaavnashil kathakaar ne kahani likhnaa band kyon kar diya? Pushplal Upadhyay is a noted Nepali litterateur

 Chauth's Barwara is a small town in Sawai Madhopur district in the state of Rajasthan and is the tehsil headquarters by the same name
 yah shahar rajasthan ke tonk-savai madhopur loksabhaa kshetra main aata he evam is shahar kaa vidhaan sabha kshetra khandar lagata he
 The Chauth Mata temple here is famous all over Rajasthan! The Barwada town of Chauth is an area of meena and Gurjar in the lap of the Aravalli mountain range
 This small town, known as Barwada, became famous as Chauth Ka Barwada in Samvat 1451 in the name of Chauth Mata which remains till the present! Apart from Chauth Mata Temple, this city has a grand temple of Pisces God! On the other hand, Chauth Mata Trust Dharamshala is an important place to stay for all religious people! The large villages of Chauth's Barwara tehsil are as follows: - • Chauth's Barwara • Bhagwatgarh • Shivad • Jhopra • Israda • Sarsop etc
 chouth kaa barwada kaa sampoorn itihaas chouth mata shakti peeth ke ird gird ghumta he, is gaanv main chouth bhavani kaa bhavy mandir he jo aravali shakti giri pahaad shrinkhalaa ke upar 1100 feet kii oonchaai par sthit he, is mandir kii sthapana maharaja bhimsingh chouhan ne samvath 1451 main barwada ke pahaad par kii
 Barwada of the present Chauth was known as "BARBARA" in ancient times which has been a part of the Ranthambore empire, Bijalsingh and Bhimsingh Chauhan were the chief rulers of this region
 barwada kshetra ke paas churu evam pachaalaa jo ki vartmaan main gaanv ban gaye hai wo pracheen kaal main ghanghur jangalon main adivaasiyon ke thaharne ke pramukh sthal the
 The first statue of Chauth Mata is supposed to be around the Charu forests
 ek kinvadanti ke anusaar kahan jaataa he ki pracheen kaal main churu jangalon main ek bhayanak agni punj kaa practy hua, jisase daarud bhairo kaa vinaash hua tha
 Seeing the miracles of this statue, the tribals of the forest became fond of the statue and based on their clan, started worshiping it in the name of Chaura Mata, later Chau Mata's name gradually became Charu Mata and later on it became Apabhramsa Chauth became a mother
 kahan jaataa he ki is mata ko sarvapratham chaur arthath kanjar jati ke logon ne apni kuladevi ke rup main puja tha, baad main adivaasiyon ne bhi ise hi apni aradhya devi ke rup main mana jo ki meena janajati se sambandhit the
 This is the reason that Chauth Mata came to be known as the Kuldevi of the tribals Meenas and Kanjars
 varshon baad chouth mata kii pratimaa churu ke vikat jangalon se achaanak vilupt ho gai, jiskaa parmaan sahi rup se kahana bada mushkil he, magar iske varshon baad yahi pratimaa barwada kshetra kii pachaalaa talahati main maharaja bhimsingh chouhan ko swapn main dikhne lagi, lekin bhimsingh chouhan ne ise andekha kar diya
 Where does it go that once Maharaja Bhimsinh Chauhan had a dream in the night that i am forgetting the tradition of hunting, due to this dream, Maharaja Bhimsinh Chauhan decided to go hunting, Maharaja Bhimsinh Chauhan in the evening from Barwara Decided to go and started preparing for hunting
 bhimsingh chouhan kii rani kaa naam ratnavali tha
 It is said that Ratnavali strongly forbade King Bhim Singh Chauhan not to go on a hunt, but Bhimsingh deferred the matter by saying that "chauhan gets down by hunting only after riding"
 is prakaar rani kii baat ko ansuni karke bhimsingh chouhan apane sainikon ke saath ghanghur jangalon kii taraf kooch kar gaye
 It was evening but Bhimsingh Chauhan kept on hunting for hunting in the jungles, Yakayake Maharaja Bhimsingh Chauhan saw a deer and started chasing the deer, soldiers also started growing with the king, but it was night in the jungles
 Because of leaving, all the soldiers strayed from each other
 maharaja bhimsingh ne raat ho jane ke kaaran mrug kaa peechha aawaaj ko lakshya banaakar karne kaa nishchay kiya or mrug kii ore badhate chale gaye
 The deer slowly disappeared from the eyes of Bhim Singh Chauhan
 jab tak raja ke sabhi sainik raja se rasta bhatak chuke the
 Bhimsingh Chauhan looked around but no soldiers were near him and started searching for the source of water because he was very thirsty
 bahut koshish ke baad bhi jab pani nahin mila to bhimsingh chouhan moorchhit hokar jangalon main gir pade
 Bhimsingh began to see the same statue in the foothills below
 tabhi achaanak bhayankar barish hone lagi evam megh garajane lage va bijli kadakane lagi, jab raja kii barish ke kaaran murchha tuuti to raja dekhtaa he ki chaaron taraf pani hi pani najar aayaa, raja ne pehle pani piya or dekha ki ek balika andhkaar bhari raat main swayan surya jaisi prakashmay ujjwal bal rup main kanya khelti najar ai
 bhimsingh chouhan us kanya ko dekhakar thodaa bhaybheet hua or bolaa ki he bala is jangal main tum akeli kya kar rahi ho? tumhaare maan baap kahan par he, raja kii baat ko sunakar nanhee balika hansane lagi or totari vaani main boli ki he rajan tum yah bataao kii tumhaari pyaas buji yaa nahin, itnaa kahkar bhagwati apane asli rup main aa gai, itnaa hote hi raja maan ke charnon main gir gaya or bolaa he adishkti mahamaya mujhe aap se kuch nahin chahie agar aap mujh par khush ho to hamaare kshetra main aap hameshaa nivas karen ! raja bhimsingh chouhan ko mata chouth ne kahan he rajan tumhaari ichha puri hogi, yah kahkar bhagwati shivamaya antardhyaan ho gai
 jahaan par mahamaya lupt hui vahaan se raja ko chouth mata kii pratimaa mili
 The king walked towards Barwada with the statue of the same Chauth Mata, the king told the people coming to Barwada the whole situation and established Magha Krishna Chaturthi on the top of the mountain in Barwada of Adishakti Chauth Bhawani in Samvat 1451, since then
 Till date, the fair of Chauth Mata is filled on this day, in which lakhs of people from India come to seek the blessings of the mother
 bhimsingh chouhan ke liye ukt kahawat aaj bhi chal rahi he:-churu chhod pachaalo chhodyon, barwada dhari malaan, "bhimsingh chouhan ku, maan di parachya parmaan In this way, after adding the name of Chauth in front of Barwara area in the name of Chauth Mata, Maharaja Bhimsingh Chauhan gave the new name of this area to Barwada of Chauth
 suhaag puja ke liye bharatvarsh main prasiddh chouth mata ke mandiron main sabase adhik khyaati praapt chouth kaa barwada sthit chouth mata shakti peeth mana jaataa he, isliye chouth kaa barwada ko shakti nagar ke naam se pukarana atishyokti nahin hoga, chouth mata kaa pratham sthaan churu, dwitiya pachaalaa gaanv rahaa he vahiin samvath 1451 se vartmaan tak yah mandir chouth kaa barwada par sthit he

 kinvadantiyon ke anusaar meena samaaj kaa barwaal gautra bhi chouth mata ko apni kuladevi maanata he
 Many years later, the ruler of the Indore house, Malhar Rao Holkar, planned to attack Jaipur by mobilizing forces at Sawai Madhopur

 antat: presidency kalege main aap assistant prafessor ke saamaanya pad par niyukt kiye gaye, jabaki inase kam yogyata ke angrej unche padon or kahin adhik vetanon par usee kalege main niyukt the
 When you opposed this injustice to the then English director of the Education Department, he satirized that "if you are such a qualified chemist, why not run a business?" The effect of these sharp words was that Rai later started the work of Bengal Chemical and Pharmaceutical Curves in 1892 with a small capital of 800 rupees, in his living room, to prepare luxurious medicines
 Tax has become a factory worth crores of rupees today and has led to the introduction of other such industries in the country

 Despite record sales once again in the late 1973 and 1970s, Cadillac began to suffer from the uneasiness spread in the American automobile industry in the 1970s and 1980s, partly due to new government efficiencies in safety, emissions and fuel efficiency
 There was a failure to deal with the rules

 With the stop of production of STS and DTS, Cadillac will no longer have top class models

 It is also known that the wheelbase of the next CTS, which is to be brought in 2013, will be increased which will be taken from the upcoming Alpha platform
 Its size and price increase and its coupe and wagon options are expected to be removed

 Being an inseparable part of the Indian Union, it is not appropriate to separate Kerala's economic system from the national economic system
 phir bhi kerala kii aarthik vyavastha kii apni visheshtaayen hai
 The achievements of Kerala are commendable as per the basic information of human resource development
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas ke buniyadi tattvon main ullekhneey hai - bharat ke anya rajyon kii tulana main aabaadi kii kam vruddhi dar, rashtriya ausat saghanta se unchi dar, unchi aayu-dar, gambhir swasthya chetana, kam shishu mrityu dar, unchi sakshartaa, praathmik shiksha kii saarvajaniktaa, ucch shiksha kii suvidha aadi aarthik pragati ke anukool hai
 But due to slowdown in production sector, high unemployment rate, rising market prices, low per capita income, impact of consumer litigation etc
, the economy of Kerala is getting complicated
 lambi aayu dar ke maamle main kerala kii tulana dakshin korea, malaysia, china aadi se kii ja sakati he
 But all three are different from Kerala and are on the path of economic development
 yadhyapi maanav sansaadhan vikaas ke suchakon ke anusaar kerala bhartiya rajyon main agrani he
 In the past, Kerala's per capita income rate was below the national income rate
 jabaki kerala kii aarthik vyavastha vikaas kaa gun prakat karti he
 The economic growth of Kerala in the late eighties has surpassed the average national economic growth rate
 yah vikaas abhi bhi jari he
 But this alone does not make the state strong
 vaishvikaran ke pratikul prabhaav ne krishi tathaa anya paramparaagat kshetron kaa khaatmaa kar diya he
 Development has not been done in these areas for the last six-seven years
 lekin ab is sthiti main badlaav aana shuru hua he jo shubhasuchak he
 Kerala has to achieve economic development which is just, permanent and immediate
 saath hi vikaas ke kshetra main jo niti apanaai gayi he usamen sarkari hastkshep kam karne yaa saamaajik kalyaan ke vyay kam karne kaa koi prayaas nahin dikhaai detaa
 Development of pre-independence Thiruvittankur, Kochi, Malabar regions is the backdrop of modern Kerala's economic system
 bhugolic evam prakritik visheshtaayen kerala kii aarthik vyavastha ko prakritik sampada ke vaividhya ke saath shram sambandhi vaividhya bhi pradaan karti hai
 Kerala is divided into three major geographical regions
 tateey kshetra sarvaadhik saghan aabaadi vaala kshetra he
 Its fertile soil, riverine area, lakes etc
 are suitable for fish production, rice, coconut and greens
 parvatiy evam samudr tateey kshetron ke bich ke pradeshon main nariyal, chaaval, tapyoka, supaari ke ped, kaashew ke ped, rabad, kalimirch, adarak aadi kii kheti hoti he
 The cultivation of coffee, tea, rubber in the Eastern Pahari region has been going on since colonial times
 20 veen sadi ke madhya main purvi pahari kshetra main jansanchaar evam sthaapan hua isse kerala kii aarthik vyavastha viksit hui
 Agriculture in Kerala is suitable for food grains and export crops
 shashan vyavastha tathaa vyapaar ke kaaran niryaat kii janevaali fasalon badhotari hui he
 Coir industry, wood industry, edible oil production etc
 are also based on agriculture
 isi ke saath hi dhaatuen, rasayan vastuen, ejineering aadi ko aadhaar banane vaale bade-bade udyog bhi vikaas karne lage hai
 Public and private establishments are working in these areas
 kayar utpaadan, kaarigari, handloom aadi kerala ke paramparaagat vyavsaay he
 Nevertheless, it is not fair to say that Kerala's economic system is based solely on agriculture
 kerala ke aarthik vikaas kaa ullekhneey pahalu na to praathmik kshetra maane janevaala krishi udyog he or na hi vibhinn utpaadan-nirmaan se yukt udyog kshetra he
 The main aspect of economic development is the third sector called the service sector
 keraly aamadani tathaa rojgaar kaa adhikansh bhaag yaheen se praapt hota he
 Kerala is moving ahead of the other states of India in almost all the regions, generally any state can reach the high foot of economic development only by crossing the first, second and third regions
 is aarthik siddhant ke viruddh pratham kshetra evam dwitiya kshetra ko chod tritiy kshetra main pahunchakar kerala mrityu dar, sakshartaa aurat aayu aadi main viksit deshon ke samaksh sthaan grahan kar saktaa he
 How Kerala could achieve this status by making low capital per capita income and high unemployment remains an unanswered question
 bharat kaa koi bhi doosraa rajya is prakaar duniya kaa dhyaan aakrisht nahin kar sakaa
 Not only in the economic sector, but also in the political, social and cultural fields, the development that has taken place in Kerala is being discussed in developed countries
 1980 ke ant main kerala kii aarthik vyavastha ne jo unnati kii uski Kerala Model naam se videshon main bhi charchaa hui
 Many questions are raised today regarding this example
 uske sthayitv par kai arthshaastri andeh prakat karte hai
 Since the 19th century, the government has adopted a social welfare policy and under its implementation the government has been spending for basic amenities is the main source of social development of Kerala
 iske atirikt bharat ke anyaanya kshetron tathaa videshon, visheshkar khadi kshetron ke apravasi keraly se praapt dhan raashi bhi is vikaas kaa kaaran he
 The immigrant Keralais have a great contribution in the economic system of modern Kerala

 As mentioned earlier, the economic system of Kerala is developing from agricultural culture to service culture
 bharat kii krishi pradhan aarthik vyavastha main kerala kaa pramukh sthaan he
 The elements that determine the agricultural life of Kerala are: - The specific natural area, the variety of soils and the climate
 kerala kii pramukh fasalein hai - chaaval, nariyal, daal kii vibhinn kismein, rabad, supaari, ilaychi, coffee, chaay, kaashew, tapyoka, kalimirch, adarak, haldi, cocao, laung, jaifal aadi
 North Indian crops like potato, onion etc
 are also grown here
 rabad, coffee, ilaychi, chaay aadi farm fasalein maani jaati hai
 The second type of crops are mainly with the farming families who are adopting agriculture as a livelihood
 kerala kaa krishi kshetra anek sankaton kaa saamana kar rahaa he jinamein chaaval tathaa nariyal donon ke utpaadan kshetra main ghor sankat hai
 Today, Kerala has to depend on other states for rice and vegetables
 yahi nahin krishi bhoomi kaa vistaar bhi ghat gaya he
 The period of soil-filling in agricultural land is going on, which is pushing Kerala towards serious crisis
 yadhyapi kheton main mitti daalkar unhen nariyal ke bageeche banaaya gaya he phir bhi nariyal ke utpaadan main vruddhi nahin hui he
 The production of coconut in 1992 - 1993 was 5843 per hectare which in 2000 increased to 5638 hectares
 rin bhaar, fasalon kaa vinaash, daam giravat ke kaaran krishakon kaa jivan kathin ban gaya he
 Therefore, the government is trying to revive agriculture by setting up agricultural packages and credit assurance commission etc
 kerala kii krishi kaa itihaas naveen prastar yug se prarambh hota he
 Primitive agricultural practices like Punam Krishi were prevalent in ancient times
 adivaasiyon ke paas unki nijee krishi reetiyaan thim
 Ancient agricultural culture was an integral part of the various tools of agriculture, native seeds, methods of conservation of seeds, agricultural period, different types of agricultural lands and agricultural customs, agricultural rituals, agricultural festivals, agricultural songs etc
 kerala ke paas krishi se sambandhit deshi gyaan kaa bada bhandar he
 Kerala has special agricultural areas, such as Kuttanad, Palakkad, Kantallur, Nelliyampati etc
 krishi kshetra main duusare ullekhneey tatv hai - choti-bady jal-sinchan yojanaayen, jalaashyon ke vikaas kii yojanaayen aadi
 Fisheries and animal husbandry are also the main tasks of the agriculture sector

 In those days, humans had two types of weapons - stone-made furs and tree sticks made of sticks
 kerala main bhi naveen prastar yugin krishi rahi hogi, kyonki sahyadri ke kuch kshetron se tej dhar vaale prastar - farse praapt hue hai
 The stones which were received from the banks of Tirunelli and Bavalippusha in Wayanad and from a place called Putatti are of this stone age

 Sangamam literary works, which are considered to be of great stone age, give a detailed presentation of the production process
 sanghamakaleen rachanaayen utpaadan prakriya se judy hai jo vibhinn jan-jatiyon kaa vivaran bhi detii hai
 In those days people who made agriculture a livelihood were called Vellalars
 kerala main vellalar ko vishisht jati vibhaag ke rup main nahin mana jaataa he
 Here the farmers have not been considered as belonging to any particular caste
 baad main waiter or ir varg ke log bhi krishi karm karne lage
 Seeing the fertility of the river banks, the waiters, Ayer, Kurwar etc
 settled there
 ve log kaalaantar main halwale or pulyar kahalaane lage
 The word 'pulam' means land
 krishi pradesh ko 'menpulam' tathaa uske chaaron ore ke pahari pradesh jahaan krishi nahin kii jaati, 'vanpulam' kehete the
 'mainpulum' signified the development of primitive agriculture
 yadhyapi sangham sahitya krishi kaa vistrut varnan prastut karata he tathaapi inamen utpaadan ke parinaam kaa koi ullekh nahin he
 It is also not clear whether agriculture of that period could sustain a large population
 sanghamakaleen paanch 'tinkal' roopi bhoomi ke vibhaajan kii pariklpana bhi pracheen krishak - jivan kaa chitra prastut karti he
 The next phase of the history of agriculture is after the arrival of people of Buddhist, Jain, Brahmin etc
 religion to Kerala
 buddha dharm krishi kii prerana detaa tha
 When the Brahmins settled on the river bank, they took possession of agriculture
 kheton kaa bada hissaa brahmanon ke graamon main aa gaya
 The reason for the Brahmins gaining dominance over farming was their astrological knowledge, on the basis of which they formulated a plan of agriculture and kept control of it
 mandiron kii sthapana ke dwaara unhone zamin par apana aadhipaty jamaaya
 In this way, they gained control of agricultural production even without doing agriculture directly
 is se utpaadan vyavastha main bhi parivartan aayaa
 The people called Ushwar, people of the general department, were divided into several subdivisions
 karalar, kutical, atiyaar pramukh up vibhaag ban gaye
 The major cultivators came to be known as Kaler

 fiqh islamic dharamshastra ko kaha jaataa he
 Fiqh has its impact on every aspect of Islamic life for Muslims
 jabaki shariat us samucchy niti ko kehete hai
 Which is based on Islamic legal, traditions and Islamic personal and ethical practices
 fiqh islamic nyaayashastra ke liye shabdaawalee he, jo islamic nyayavidon ke faislon se bana he
 The basic component of Islamic studies, Fiqh elaborates on the method by which Islamic law has been drawn out of primary and secondary sources
 islamic nyaayashastra kaa itihaas "prathanusaar aath avadhiyon main vibhajit" kiya gaya he
 The sources of Fiqh in order of importance are: koran kai muddon par spasht nirdesh detaa he jaise ki anivaary dainik prarthana se pehle shuddhikaran anushthan kaise karen, lekin anya muddon par, kuch musalamaanon kaa maananaa hai ki akele koran hi chijen spasht karne ke liye paryaapt nahin hai
 For example, according to the Qur'an — during the month of Ramadan, one needs to engage in daily prayers and fasting but Muslims believe they need more instruction on how to perform these duties
 in muddon ke bare main spashtikaran paighmbar mohammad kii paramparaon main paaya ja saktaa he, isliye adhikansh maamalon main daleelein koran or sunnat kaa aadhaar hai
 Some subjects in the early period of Islam are without precedent
 In those cases, Muslim jurists try to come to conclusions in other ways
 sunni nyayavid samudaay kii aitihaasik sahmati kaa prayog karte hai; aadhunik yug main adhikansh nyayavid bhi saadrishy or nae vishyon ke nafaa or nuqasaan kii tulana kaa upyog karte hai
 With the help of these additional tools, a wide array of laws are formed according to Sharia and this is called Fiqh
 is prakaar, sharia ke saamne, fiqh ko pavitra nahin mana jaataa he, or 'vichaar-prakriya ke vidyalayon' ke tafasilaat par anya nishkarshon ko pavitraapurna rup main bina dekhe hi asmaan vichaar hai
 This division of interpretation into more elaborate issues has resulted in different schools of thought process
 This broad concept of Islamic jurisprudence is the source of many laws in various disciplines that direct Muslims in everyday life
 shariat kii niti ko neenv bana kar nyaayashastra ke adhyyan ko fiqh yaa fiqah kehete hai
 Due to different interpretations of Islamic scholars in the case of Fiqh, jurisprudence in Islam got divided in many parts and many different jurisprudence related doctrines were born
 inhen mazahab kehete hai
 The main denominations in Sunni Islam are: adhiktam musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki chaaron mazahab buniyadi taur par sahi hai or inamen jo matbhed hai vah nyaayashastra kii baarik vyakhyaaon ko lekar he
 Government vipaksh Blank odisha vidhaan sabha bharat ke odisha rajya kii vidhayika hai | a transformer or transformer is an electrical machine with no moving or rotating components
 vidyut upkarnon main sambhavtah transafarmar sarvaadhik vyapak rup se prayukt vidyut sashitr he
 It transfers electrical energy from one electric circuit to another circuit by means of conductors connected by electric induction
 transfarmar keval prayavarti dhara yaa vibhavaantar ke saath kaary kar saktaa he, ekadish ke saath nahin
 Transformers can be one-phase, three-phase or multi-phase
 yah sabhi vidyut mashiinon main sarvaadhik daksh mashin he
 In the modern era, the transformer has become an integral part of the electrical and electronic industries
 kisi transafarmar main ek, do yaa adhik vinding ho sakati hai
 The number of primary and secondary winding turns of two winding transformers and their potentials has the following relation: is sutara se spasht he ki primary voltata ke diye hue maan ke liye primary evam secondari vinding ke pheron kii sankhya kaa uchit chayan karke ham dwitiyak vinding main icchit vibhavaantar praapt kar sakate hai
 When the voltage of the secondary winding is greater than the voltage of the primary winding, such transformer is called the high transformer
 iske vipareet jab dwitiyak vinding kaa vibhavaantar praathmik vinding ke vibhavaantar se kam hota he to aise parinamitra ko apchaayi parinamitra kehete hai
 The main use of transformer is to convert electric power to high voltage or low voltage
 aisa karne se vidyut urja ke upyog main suvidha or dakshata aati he
 It is important to note that the ideal transformer does not generate energy or power, nor does it change power, nor does it change frequency
 parinamitra prayukt vidyut ke kshetra main Probably the most widely used vaidyut sashitr he
 All the credit for the predominance of the alternating current in the industries as compared to the direct current is only to the resultant
 yah aisa saadhitra he jo nimnavoltata kii ucch dhara ko ucch voltata kii nimna dhara main or ucch voltata kii nimnadhara ko nimnavoltata kii ucch dhara main parinamit karata he
 This result is accomplished with minimal loss of energy and without the aid of any moving part in the appliance
 100 volt kii 10,000 wat vidyutakti ke parinman ke liye 100 ampiore dhara aavashyak hoti he
 But only one ampere current at a voltage of 10,000 is sufficient
 at: duusari sthiti main pehali kii apeksha bahut hi kam vyasavaala or is kaaran sasta chaalak aavashyak hota he
 The conductivity of the transformer is based on a unique finding by Michael Faraday, according to which the induced conductor force in the circuit is equal to the time rate of change of magnetic flux across the region bounded by the circuit
 saralatam rup main parinamitra main do alag alag kundaliyaan hoti hai, jinka chumbakeey paripath ek hi hota he
 The coil of the transformer is identified according to the direction of flow of power
 praathmik kundali ko prayavarti vidyudurja ke strot se jodate hai or dwitiyak ko lod se
 Energy is transferred from the primary coil to the secondary coil by electromagnetic induction
 adarsh parinamitra ke kriyasanchalan kii visheshtaayen hai : In practice, this ideal situation is unpredictable
 parinamitra kii praathmik kundali se judi sambharan voltata chumbakeey flux utpann karti he, jo parinamitra ke patlit crode se sambhddha hoti he
 The alternating voltage Ep connected to the primary coil of the transformer is expressed as the density Bm of the highest magnetic flux, the area a of the transverse section of the lattice core, the frequency f of the alternating current of the alternating current, and the number of naps in the primary coil
 : praathmik kundali main pravaahit dhara dwaara utpann prayavarti chumbakeey flux dwitiyak kundali kii lapeton ko bhi sambhddha karata he
 The difference between primary and secondary coils is only the number of wraps, so the effective value of the induced voltage in the secondary coil is prakaar praathmik or dwitiyak voltata kaa nimnlikhit anupaat praapt hota he: The number of wraps in the primary coil N1 is kept less than the number of wraps of the secondary coil N2 when the voltage of the primary coil is required to increase
 is prakaar ke parinamitra ko ucchayi parinamitra kehete hai or praathmik kundali kii voltata yadi dwitiyak kii voltata se adhik he to praathmik kundali main lapeton kii sankhya N1 dwitiyak kundali kii lapeton kii sankhya N2 se badi hogi
 This type of transformer is called a catabolic transformer
 saamanyat: parinamitra kaa swaroop nimnlikhit baton se nirdhaarit hota he: The efficiency of a simple power transformer is very high at normal load, ranging from 90 percent in small units to 98 percent in large transformers
 saamaanya: pratishat main vyakt parinamitra kii dakshata ko is prakaar abhivyakt kar sakate hai : There is a difference in the instantaneous efficiency of the transformers and the efficiency throughout the day
 parinamitra ke niyantran kaa arth hota he nivesh voltata ke sthir rahane par purna lod kii sthiti main dwitiyak voltata or bina lod kii sthiti main dwitiyak voltata kaa sambandh
 When expressed as a percentage, control can be defined as: chote parinamitron ke liye niyantran 2 se 5 pratishat or bado ke liye lagbhag 1 pratishat ke kram kaa hota he
 The transformer mainly consists of two parts: 1) kor - jo kisi chumbakeey padaarth kii banaayi jaati he
 2) Winding - which is made of copper, aluminum or any other conductor wires or bus bar
 iske atirikt kuchaalak aadi bhi prayog kiye jate hai jo vinding ke pheron ko aapas main yaa kor se chhune se rokte hai
 Transformer oil is used in high voltage transformers which prevent sparks from exceeding breakdown strength and heat by cooling the core and coil
 parinamitra ko thanda rakhane ke liye tel ke alaava evam kai anya shitakon kaa prayog bhi kiya jaataa he jaise pani evam gas aadi

 The Commonwealth or Commonwealth Games is a multinational sports event
 iske saath hi isamen kai khel ek saath khele jate hai
 All the countries that participate in this sport are also members of the Olympics
 iskaa aayojan har chaar saal main ek baar hota he
 All the games which are part of the Olympics are played in it as well as the Commonwealth Games have their own special games
 is khel aayojan par niyantran kaa kaam rashtramandal khel sangh sambhalata he
 The Commonwealth Games were first held in 1930 in the city of Hamilton, Ontario
 tab is khel aayojan kaa naam british empire games tha
 The original idea for its sporting event was of an Indian named Ashlee Cooper
 unhone is khel aayojan ko aapasi shanti or sauhardra ke liye sahi maanate hue iskaa prastaav taatkaalik rajanetaaon ko diya tha
 In 1928, Canadian major athlete Bobby Robinson was given the responsibility of organizing the first Commonwealth Games
 1930 main pehali baar is khel aayojan kaa shubharambh hua jisamen maatr 11 deshon ke 400 khilaadiyon ne hissaa liya tha
 Its name also changed several times like in 1954 it was called as British Empire and Common Wealth Games and in 1970 from British Commonwealth Games
 Finally in 1978, it was unanimously named the Commonwealth Games
 varsh 1998 main kualalampur main yojit rashtramandal khelon main ek bada badlaav dekha gaya jab cricket, hockey or netball jaise khelon ne pehali baar apni upasthiti darj karai
 haalanki cricket ko abhi bhi manyata nahi mil pai he
 What distinguishes these Commonwealth Games from other sporting events is its purpose and its policy
 rashtrmandal khel teen nitiyon ko maanata he Humanity, equality and destiny
 It believes that this will increase the spirit of peace and cooperation around the world
 These policies inspire thousands of people and by connecting them together give a broader view of the adoption of sports within Commonwealth countries
 iske pratiyogiyon kii baat karen to isamen 6 desh aise hai jo prayek varsh isamen hissaa lete hai
 In the previous Commonwealth Games held in Melbourne, teams of 71 countries including all 53 Commonwealth countries participated
 or haa, varsh 1930 main shuru hone ke baad dwitiya vishwa yuddh kii vajah se 1930-1942 ke madhya in khelon kaa aayojan na ho sakaa
 magar 1942 main ek baar phir se in khelon kaa aayojan hone laga
 Its symbols and some other facts are also interesting, such as the Queen's Baton Relay, symbols and logos etc
 aaie in par bhi ek najar daalate hai Commonwealth countries were created by Britain
 isamen vah sabhi 53 desh shaamil hai jo kabhi british aupniveshik vyavastha ke bhaag the
 The motive behind the creation of Commonwealth countries was to promote democracy, literacy, human rights, better administration, free trade and world peace
 rashtramandal khelon kii ek mahaan parampara maharani kii beton riley he
 In the beginning, the British flag was used in place of the relay, which was run by the Queen's hands and runners
 yah jhanda in khelon main british prabhusatta ko darshata tha
 But after 1950, the relay was started by a group of runners from Buckingham Palace, UK
 yah riley parmparik rup se buckingham pales, landan main shubharambh kaarykram se shuru hoti he, jiske dauraan maharani apane sandesh ke saath dhaavak ko beton saunpti hai jo riley kaa pratham maanak dhaavak hota he
 Later, the right to receive this baton was given to all big sports personalities
 baaki ke sabhi deshon main angreji kii varnmaala ke mutabik baari-baari is riley ko le jaaya jaataa he
 There is no common symbol of the Commonwealth Games
 har varsh aayojan karne vaale desh apane mutabik is pratik ko chunate hai
 "shera" is the symbol of the Commonwealth Games to be held in India this year
 shera kaa taatpary hota he sher
 iskaa pardaapan melbern ke rashtramandal khelon ke samaapan samaaroh main kiya gaya
 Shera is considered a sign of valor, courage, strength and grandeur
 yah naarangi or kaali pattiyon vaala sher bharat kii bhaavana ko prakat karata he, jabaki iske shaury kii kahani khilaadiyon ko apana sarvottam pradarshan karne kii bhaavana se bhar detii he
 Shera is considered to have a big heart that fills everyone with a "come and play" feeling
 pratik kii tarah hi iskaa logo bhi samaan nahin rahata haalanki iske samaan prayog ke liye sangh rashtramandal deshon kaa logo hi upyog karata he
 This year, the cycle has been used as a logo in sports
 chakra bharat kii swatantraaa, ekta or shakti kaa rashtriya pratik he
 It reminds me to keep going forever
 upar kii ore sakriy yah sataranga chakra maanav akruti main darshaya gaya he jo ek garvonnat or rang-birange raashtra kii vruddhi ko urja dene ke liye bharat ke vividh samudaayon ko ek saath laane kaa pratik he
 Inspirational line of logo is 'come and play'
 yah raashtra ke prayek vyakti ko isamen bhaag lene kaa ek nimantran he jo apni sabhi sankuchit bhaawanaaon ko choden or apni sarvottam kshamta ke anusaar khel kii sachhee bhaavana ke saath isamen bhaag len
