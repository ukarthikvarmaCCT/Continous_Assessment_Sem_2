 bharat ke naanaa dharmon main aagam kaa samrajya he
 Jainism has adequate inclusion of Agamapuja even when it is low in quantity
 buddha dharm kaa 'vajrayan' isi paddati kaa prayojak maarg he
 Due to the variation of the deity worshiped in Vedic religion, it has three types: Vaishnava Agam, Shaiva Agam and Shakta Agam
 aagam parampara se aaye hindu dharm ke mahatvapurn granth hai
 These are the complements of the Vedas
 inke vaktaa praayah shivaji hote hai
 This scripture is commonly known as 'tantrashastra'
 nigamagamamoolak bhartiya samskruti kaa aadhaar jis prakaar nigam he, usee prakaar aagam bhi he
 Both are nutritious to each other despite being independent
 nigam karm, gyaan tathaa upasna kaa swaroop batalaata he tathaa aagam inke upaybhoot sadhano kaa varnan karata he
 That is why Vachaspati Mishra has derived the derivation of ‘agam’ in ‘tattvavashardi’ as follows: Agachanti Budhimaoharanti Abhyudayani: Shreyasopaya Yasmatt, Sa Agam:
 aagam kaa mukhya lakshya 'kriya' ke upar he, tathaapi gyaan kaa bhi vivaran yahan kam nahin he
 According to 'varahitantra' the Agama is confluent with these seven traits: Srishti, Pralaya, Devartharna, Sarvashakta, Purana, Shatkarma, Means and Meditation
 'mahanirvana' tantra ke anusaar kaliyug main praani medhya tathaa amedhya ke vichaaron se bahudhaa hin hote hai or inhen ke kalyanarth mahadev ne aagmon kaa upadesh parvati ko swayan diya
 That is why the worship of Agama is considered to be particularly useful and beneficial in Kali Yuga - Kalau Agamasamati:
 vaidic dharm main upasya devtaa kii bhinnata ke kaaran iske teen prakaar he: vaishnav aagam, shaiva aagam tathaa shakt aagam
 Three distinctions are also considered in terms of dvaita, dvaitaadvaita and advaita
 anek aagam vedamulak hai, parantu katipay tantron ke upar bahari prabhaav bhi lakshith hota he
 Especially the influence of China or Tibet on Shakhagam's ethics has been acknowledged in the Puranas
 aagmik puja vishuddh tathaa pavitra bhartiya he
 Ignorance of the mystery of 'panch Makar' is also productive of many illusions about it
 aisa bhi kaha jaataa he ki aagam shaastra kaa gyaan sun kar yaa gurmukh ke dwaara hi paaya ja saktaa he mahadev ke dwaara ye divyagyaan lomash rishi ko praapt hua or phir gurumukh dwaara anya ko The oldest part of Jain literature is called 'agam'
 aagam granth kaaphi pracheen he, tathaa jo sthaan vaidic sahitya kshetra main veda kaa tathaa buddha sahitya main tripitak kaa he, vahi sthaan jain sahitya main aagmon kaa he
 In the Agam texts, there is a compilation of many stories and stories related to the teachings of Mahavira and Jain culture

 Lohia was a craftsman of non-congressism in Indian politics and his untiring efforts resulted in the defeat of the Congress in several states in 1967, although the Congress at the center was able to retain some form of power

 But it is our misfortune that not only the whole eye-sighting history of that time, but Lohia, who was an active, lively character, was not allowed to understand the ruling party in independent India more than the 'annoyance' of an opposition leader, while the truth It is that the reality of the game of transfer of power was more known to the leaders like Lohia than the documents buried in the museums, which he saw through his eyes saw

 According to another legend, King Divodas, son of Maharaja Sudev, had established Varanasi city on the banks of the Ganges
 ek baar bhagwaan shankar ne dekha ki parvati ji ko apane maayke main rahane main sankoch hota he, to unhone kisi duusare siddhakshetramen rahane kaa vichaar banaaya
 He found Kashi very popular
 ve yahaan aa gaye
 With the desire of Lord Shiva to live in harmony, the gods also started living in Kashi
 raja divodas apni rajdhani kaashi kaa aadhipaty kho jane se bade du:khee hue
 He sought a boon from Brahmaji by performing rigorous penance - May the deity be in Devlok, Bhlok be for humans

 The twelve well-known names of this Puri are Kashi, Varanasi, Avimukta Kshetra, Anandakanan, Mahashmashan, Rudravas, Kashika, Tapa: Sthali, Muktabhumi, Shivpuri, Tripurairajanagari and Vishwanathanagari
 skandapurana kaashi kii mahima kaa gun-gaan karte hue kahata he- Which, despite being on the ground floor, is not associated with the earth, which, despite being bound by the boundaries of the world, is the one to reap the bondage of all, who is adorned on the banks of the Ganges and decorated with the gods, the capital of Tripurari Lord Vishwanath, that Kashi is the whole world
 Protect sanathan dharm ke granthon ke adhyayan se kaashi kaa lokottar swaroop vidit hota he
 It is said that this Puri is situated on the trident of Lord Shankar
 at: pralay hone par bhi iskaa naash nahin hota he
 It is also called Varanasi because it is inhabited by five Kos between the rivers Varuna and Asi
 kaashi naam kaa arth bhi yahi he-jahaan brahm prakashit ho
 Lord Shiva never leaves Kashi
 jahaan deh tyaagane maatr se praani mukt ho jaay, vah avimukt kshetra yahi he
 Sanatan religions have a strong belief that Lord Shankar narrates Tarakamantra to a death-oriented creature during his death in Kashi
 isse jeev ko tatvagyan ho jaataa he or uske saamne apana brahmaswaroop prakashit ho jaataa he
 The epigraph of the scriptures is- kaashi main kahin par bhi mrityu ke samay bhagwaan vishweshwar praaniyon ke daahine kaan main tarak mantra kaa upadesh dete hai
 After listening to the Tarakamantra, the organism becomes free from bondage
 yah manyata he ki keval kaashi hi sidhe mukti detii he, jabaki anya tirthasthan kaashi kii prapti karake moksh pradaan karte hai
 In this context, it is also written in Kashikhand- aisa isliye he ki paanch kos kii sampurna kaashi hi vishwa ke adhipati bhagwaan vishwanath kaa aadhibhautik swaroop he
 Kashikhand considers the entire Kashi as the form of Jyotirlinga
 paanch kos pariman ke avimukt naamak kshetra ko vishweshwar sanjyak jyotirling-swaroop maananaa chahie
 Many scholarly scholars have written and said a lot supporting the theory of Kashi Marananmukti
 ramakrishna mishan ke swami sharadanandji dwaara likhit shriramkrishna-leelaprasang naamak pustak main shriramkrishna paramhans dev kaa is vishay main pratyaksh anubhav varnit he

 Falgun shukla-ekadashi is called Rangabhari Ekadashi in Kashi

 The journey of Muktadayinikashi, the abode and death here and the cremation of the fortunes are attained only by the grace of the virtues of previous lives and by the grace of Baba Vishwanath
 tabhi to kaashi kii stuti main kaha gaya he- Vishwanathji's very best city, Kashi, is derived from the glory of the virtues of previous births
 yahaan sharir chhodne par praaniyon ko mukti avashya milti he
 Kashi is the city of Baba Vishwanath

 isliye yah pralay ke samay bhi nasht nahin hoti
 There is a clear mention in this context in the ancient Brahma Vyakarta Purana that the immortal sages ask Sri Sanatana Mahavishnu during the Holocaust - o Lord! Mahavishnu said - o sages! When we remembered Lingarupadhari Sadasivamahadeva for the welfare of the three worlds, then that Sambhu came out of our heart in the form of a bit of a linga and then he became five Kos with increasing growth - yah kaashi vahi panchakroshaatmakajyotirlighai
 This plot is found in the second chapter of Kashirhasya
 skandapuranake kashikhandamein swayan bhagwaan shiv yah ghoshnaa karte hai- Consider the entire Panchakroshvikhetika, a Jyotirlinga called Vishveshwar, which is the Mahakshetra called Avicamut of five Kosas magnitude
 isi kaaran kaashi pralay hone par bhi nasht nahin hoti
 In Kashi Khand, Lord Shankar tells the abode of Baba Vishwanath in the entire Kashi of five Kos- jaise suryadev ek jagah sthit hone par bhi sab ko dikhaai dete hai, vaise hi sampurna kaashi main sarvatra baba vishwanath kaa hi darshan hota he
 Vishveshwara himself also calls his Puri of the Five Kos as his own form - Panchakrosya Parimitatanureshapuri Mum
 kaashi kii seemaa ke vishay main shastron kaa kathan he-asee- varanyormadhye panchakroshmahataram

 panchakroshaat makajyotirlig-swaroopakashi sampoorn vishwa ke swami shri vishwanath kaa nivas-sthaan hone se bhav-bandhan se muktidaayini he
 It has also been said in the scriptures - Kashi death anniversary
 kaashi kii parikrama karne se sampoorn prithvi kii pradakshina kaa punyafal praapt hota he
 The devotee becomes free from all sins and becomes holy
 teen panchakroshi-parikrama karne vaale ke janm-janmaantar ke sabhi paap nasht ho jate hai
 Kashi residents should do panchkosi-parikrama at least once a year because sins committed in other places are consumed in the merits of the pilgrimage of Kashi, but the destruction of sins in Kashi is possible only through panchkosi-pradakshina
 kaashi main sadachaar-sanyam ke saath dharm kaa paalan karnaa chahie
 It is not a place of tourism but a holy place of pilgrimage
 vastut:kaashi or vishweshwar jyotirligmein tatvat:koi bhed nahin he
 Of course, the entire Kashi is the form of Baba Vishwanath
 kaashi-mahatmaya main rishiyon kaa udghosh he-kaashi sarvapivishveshrupininathrasanshay:
 Therefore, do not be skeptical to consider Kashi as Vishwanathji and chant daily with devotion - Shiva: Kashi Shiva: Kashi, Kashi Kashi Shiva: Shiva

 di moivar kaa prameya yaa di moivar kaa sutara samishra sankhyaon ke ghaat se sambandhit ek mahatvapurn sutara he
 It was rendered by Abraham de Moyvar
 is prameya ke anusaar, Where n is any integer and x is any complex number
 is sutara kii mahatta is baat main he ki yah samishra sankhyaon ko trikonmiti se jodta he
 "" cos x + i sin x "'is also abbreviated as" cis x "
 di myver kaa prameya samishra vishleshan sambandhi islrar ke sutara se praapt kiya ja saktaa he And according to the law of exponentialness, at: ular ke sutara ke anusaar, Three stages are possible here: ab, n = k + 1 ke liye vyanjak likhane par : We deduce that the result is true for n = k + 1 when it is true for n = k
 By the principle of mathematical induction it follows that the result is true for all positive integers n≥1
 When n = 0 the formula is true since cos ⁡ + i sin ⁡ = 1 + i 0 = 1 { \ displaystyle \ cos+i \ sin=1+i0=1}, and z 0 = 1 { \ displaystyle z^{0}=1} 
 When n <0, we consider a positive integer m such that n = −m
 So Hence, the theorem is true for all integer values of n
 Being an equality of complex numbers, one necessarily has equality both of the real parts and of the imaginary parts of both members of the equation
 If x, and therefore also cos ⁡ x { \ displaystyle \ cos x} and sin ⁡ x { \ displaystyle \ sin x}, are real numbers, then the identity of these parts can be written as These equations are in fact even valid for complex values of x, because both sides are holomorphic functions of x, and two such functions that coincide on the real axis necessarily coincide on the whole complex plane
 Here are the concretre instances of these equations for n = 2 { \ displaystyle n=2} and n = 3 { \ displaystyle n=3} : The right hand side of the formula for cos ⁡ { \ displaystyle \ cos} is in fact the value t n { \ displaystyle T_ {n}} of the Chebyshev polynomial t n { \ displaystyle T_ {n}} at cos ⁡ x
 { \ displaystyle \ cos x

 In fact, this formula is true even when both z and w are complex numbers

 Hence the following statement is true: di moivar ke sutara kii sahaayta se kisi bhi samishra sankhya kaa nvaz mul nikaala ja saktaa he
 If z { \ displaystyle z} is a complex number, it can be written in polar format as follows: tab Where k is an integer

 rachnawad ek adhigam siddhant he yaa shaikshik darshan he jis par anek shikshakon ne 1990 ke dashak main vichaar karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 One of the primary tenets of this philosophy is that learners construct their own meanings from new information when they interact with others of reality or different perspectives

 The aim of educational technology is to improve the situation of education without technology
 daawa kiye gayi laabhon main se kuch neeche soochibaddh hai: Although technology has many benefits in the classroom, there are also obvious drawbacks
 uchit prashikshan kii kami, ek praudyogiki kii paryaapt maatra tak simit pahunch or praudyogiki ke kai kriyanvayanon ke liye atirikt samay kii aavashyaktaa, kuch kaaran hai jinaki vajah se aksar kaksha main praudyogiki kaa bade paimaane par prayog nahin kiya jaataa he
 Similar to learning a new task or business, specialized training is important to ensure effective integration of classroom technology

 If either of these two areas is lacking, then technology will be seen as a hindrance rather than a benefit to the goals of teaching
 ek or kathinaayee pesh kii jaati he jab ek sansaadhan kii paryaapt maatra tak pahunch simit hoti he
 It has often been observed that the amount of computers or the number of digital cameras for classroom use is not sufficient to meet the needs of an entire class
 kuch kam suchit rup main aisa bhi hota he ki praudyogiki kii oonchi laagat or kharaab hone ke dar se praudyogiki anusandhan ke liye simit pahunch hoti he
 In other cases, the inconvenience of resource placement such as transporting a class to a computer lab by transport rather than facilitating computer access to a classroom via laptop is an obstacle

 Another major issue arises due to the developing nature of technology
 jab bhi takneekee manch badal jaataa he, naye sansaadhan dizin or vitarit karne hote hai
 After such changes it is often difficult to obtain quality materials to support classroom objectives, even after their adequate availability, teachers have to design these resources accordingly

 Valuable metal is a metallic element that is rare in nature and economically valuable

 bhoojal yaa bhugarbhik jal dharti kii sataha ke neeche chattaanon ke kanon ke bich ke antarkash yaa randhrakash main maujuud jal ko kehete hai
 Generally, when the term is used as water below the surface to differentiate from ground water, soil water is also included in it
 haalaanki, yah mrudaa jal se alag hota he jo keval sataha se neeche kuch hi gaharaai main mitti main mauzood jal ko kehete hai
 Groundwater is a natural resource as a source of freshwater
 maanav ke liye jal kii prapti kaa ek pramukh strot bhoojal ke antargat aane vaale jalbhre angreji: Aquifers) hai jinase kuon or nalkupon dwaara pani nikaala jaataa he
 The ground water that has permeated deep into the earth and cannot be extracted by human beings by resorting to the current technology or will cost more financially than utility, is not part of the water resource
 sansaadhan keval vahiin hai jinke dohan kii sambhaavna prabal or aarthik rup se laabhkaar ho
 Groundwater located at extreme depths is called fossil water or fossil water
 jal chakra prithvi par pani ke chakran se sambandhit he
 It depicts how water changes from one place to another in its solid, liquid and gaseous forms and how it is transported from one place to another
 bhoojal bhi jalchakr kaa hissaa he or isamen bhi pani ke aagaman or nirgaman ke strot or maarg hote hai
 First, we look at the technical terms associated with certain processes, such as filtration, overflow, etc
 bhoojal punarbharan ek jalavaigyanik prakriya he jiske antargat satahi jal riskar or prithvi ke gurutvkarshan se khinch kar bhoojal kaa hissaa ban jaataa he
 This phenomenon is called groundwater recharge by leakage or filtration
 bhoojal punarbharan ek prakritik prakriya he jise aajkal kritrim rup se sanvardhit karne kii disha main prayaas kiye ja rahe hai kyonki jis teji se manushya bhu jal kaa dohan kar rahaa he keval prakritik prakriya punarbharan main sakasham nahin he

 kuch vishisht jalwiviya dashaon vaale kshetron main yah jam kar barf bhi ban jaataa he jise parmafrast kehete hai
 In some volcanic areas, the ground water at the bottom is also continuously converted into vapor
 jalbhar dharaatal kii sataha ke neeche chattaanon kaa ek aisa sanstar he jahaan bhoojal ekatrit hota he or manushya dwaara nalkupon se nikaalane yogya anukool dashaon main hota he
 Although water is present in all the rocks below the water level, but it is not necessary that it can be removed for human use
 jalbhre aisi chattaanon ke sanstar hai jinamein randhrakash bade hote hai jisase pani kii zyada maatra ikaitha ho sakati he tathaa saath hi inamen pargamyata zyada hoti he jisase pani kaa sancharan ek jagah se duusari jagah ko teji se hota he

 Prominent among them are: bhoojal kaa vaishvik or sthaneey vitaran sarvatra saamaan nahin paaya jaataa
 Generally, the amount of groundwater is found in the areas with rocky ground and igneous rocks
 isaki sarvaadhik maatra jalodh chattaanon or balua jalodh chattaanon main paayi jaati he
 Apart from this, the local climate also has an effect because groundwater recharge depends on the amount and nature of rainfall
 pedo kii maatra or unki jadon kii gaharaai bhi bhoojal punarbharan ko prabhavit karti he
 Some regions in the world are rich in ground water such as the Amazon Basin, Congo Basin, Gangetic Plain and Western Europe
 vahiin registani ilaakon main bhoojal kaa str kaafii nicha paaya jaataa he or yahan is sansaadhan kii kami he
 Like elsewhere, the distribution of ground water in India is not uniform everywhere
 bharat ke pathari bhaag hameshaa se bhoojal ke maamle main kamjor rahe hai
 Here groundwater is found in some special geological formations such as fault basins and cracks
 uttari bharat ke jalodh maidan hameshaa se bhoojal main sampann rahe hai lekin ab uttari pashchimi bhaagon main sinchai hetu teji se dohan ke kaaran inamen abhootpurv kami darj kii gai he
 Concerns are being expressed about the status of waterfowl and groundwater in India
 jis tarah bharat main bhoojal kaa dohan ho rahaa he bhavishya main sthitiyaan kaaphi khatarnaak ho sakati hai
 At present, 29% of the development blocks are either at a pathetic level of ground water or are worrying and according to some statistics, by 2025, about 60% of the blocks will be in a worrisome state
 gyatavya he ki bharat main 60% sinchai etu jal or lagbhag 85% peya jal kaa strot bhoojal hi he, aise main bhoojal kaa teji se girtaa str ek bahut badi chunauti ke rup main ubhar rahaa he
