 Local experts suggest that the style based on the Sabalsingh Chauhan text should in fact be called a style of the Mahabharata, not Pandwani, as Pandwani's propaganda in Chhattisgarh was established in the pre-brahmin period of pradhan and devar singers, hence it developed later
 The non-brahmin artists of the Vedmati style adopted the same conservative name for their style

 praveshdwar kya hai? · praveshdwar kaise dhundhen· praveshdwar kaise banaayen • acha praveshdwar kaise banaaen· shaamil kaise hon· inhen bhi dekhen The concept of a portal originated in the Polish and German Wikipedias
 In early 2005, the portal concept was imported to the English Wikipedia and the first Wikiportals were established
 Later that year, a special namespace was created for portals
 The idea of a portal is to help readers and / or editors navigate their way through Wikipedia topic areas through pages similar to the Main Page
 In essence, portals are useful entry-points to Wikipedia content
 Portals are subject to the five pillars of Wikipedia, and must comply with Wikipedia's core content policies like Wikipedia: Neutral point of view, Wikipedia: No original research and Wikipedia: Verifiability
 At present, there are 0 featured portals, of a total of saanchaa:number of portals portals on Wikipedia
 All portals should be listed at the directory of portals, which also details their founding dates and whom you can contact with regard to a particular portal
 If you have created a portal, you must list it here
 Portal: List of portals lists all portals of reader-ready quality
 Portals are also largely inter-accessible with users able to navigate from one portal to another
 Universal features, such as the browsebar, and the portals template, allow for convenient browsing
 Moreover, portals are also categorised according to hierarchy
 Portals, in most instances, will also link to their Related portals and their Subportals 
 While the top-level portals are linked to directly from the Main Page, individual portals are linked by placing {{portal}} on a page
 In the main namespace, these templates should be located at the top of an article's talk page, often due to being integrated into wikiproject banner templates
 Per WP: ALSO, they may also be placed in the "see also" section of articles
 There is no single standard design for portals, but the most widely used layout is the "box portal"
 The use of this design is recommended due to the ease with which it can be created and maintained
 For further ideas on portal design, browse existing portals and see the featured portals
 For step-by-step instructions on how to set up a new portal, refer to the instructions page
 Once you have created the portal, please update {{number of portals}}
 Most portals contain the following for readers: You may want to embark on an effort to fill the related categories with appropriate articles if this has not been done already
 Just as with Wikipedia at large, portals can be edited by anyone
 However, it is important to pay due regard to the established work of others
 Editors are always needed to maintain individual portals; if you would like to participate in the upkeep of a particular portal, note your intention on its talk page, list yourself as a maintainer in the directory of portals, and get to work! a wikiproject on Portals has been founded to coordinate portal activity
 The current objectives are to develop standards for all portals and to ensure maintenance
 Other tasks include the integration and categorization of portals
 Immediate attention is needed at portals listed in category:portals under construction and category:portals needing attention
 Portals: Featured | List | Directory | wikiproject | Guidelines | Instructions | Categorizing | Peer review | Categories samantfal sutt dighanikaay ke 34 sutton main se doosraa he

 da tregedi of makebeth ek raaj-hatya or uske baad kii ghatnaon par wiliam shakespeare dwaara likhaa gaya ek naatak he, yaa sankshep main kahen to makebeth shakespeare kii ek kriti he
 It is Shakespeare's shortest mourning drama and is believed to have been written sometime between 1603 and 1603
 shakespeare ke naatak par kisi abhinay kaa sabase pehla sandarbh sambhawatah april 1611 kaa he jab simon forman ne aise hi ek naatak ko globe theatre main record kiya tha
 It was first published in a 1623 folio, presumably a dialogue book for a specific act
 is shokat naatak ke liye shakespeare ke strot holincoads chronicals main scotland, macdaf or dancan ke king makebeth ke sandarbh hai, yah rachana shakespeare or unke samakalinon ke liye parichit england, scotland or ireland kaa itihaas he
 However, the story of Macbeth told by Shakespeare has no connection with the actual events in Scottish history because Macbeth was an acclaimed and capable emperor
 rangamanch ke nepathy kii duniya main kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki yah naatak abhishpt he or iske sheershak kaa ullekh jor dekar nahin kiya jayega, isaki bajaay ise "da scottish play" jaise naamon se sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 Over the centuries the play has attracted many of the greatest actors in the roles of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth
 ise film, televijan, opera, upanyaas, hasya pustaken or anya media ke liye roopantarit kiya gaya he
 The first role of the play begins between thunder and lightning where the three witches decide that they will next meet Macbeth
 agle drishy main ek ghayal sargent scotland ke raja dancan ko yah soochna detaa he ki unke senapati – makebeth or bainko – ne abhi-abhi norge or ireland kii sanyukt senaaon ko haraa diya he jinka netritv gaddaar mcdonwald dwaara kiya ja rahaa tha
 The kings' relative Macbeth is praised for his bravery and fighting skills
 drishy badalata he
 Jacob and Banquo enter, discussing the season and their victory
 While they are walking in a bushy field, three witches enter, waiting to greet them with prophecies
 iske baavjood ki bainko pehle unhen chunauti detaa he, ve makebeth se mukhaatib hoti hai
 The first witch calls Macbeth the "thane of Glamis", the second calls her the "thane of Codor" and the third claims he will be "a king after this"
 makebeth stabdh ho kar maun ho jaataa he, isliye bainko unhen phir se chunauti detaa he
 Chudail tells Banquo that he will give birth to many kings, though he himself will not become king
 While both men are surprised at these announcements, Chudell disappears and Ross, another Thane, an angel of the king, arrives and informs him of the new title given to Macbeth: the Thane of Codor
 is prakaar pehali bhavishyavaanee puri ho jaati he
 Immediately, Macbeth begins to develop in his mind ambitions to become king
 makebeth chudilon kii bhavishyavaanee ke bare main apni patni ko likhata he
 When Duncan decides to stay at Macbeth's palace in Inverness, Lady Macbeth makes a plan to kill him and secure the throne for her husband
 haalanki makebeth is raaj-hatya par apni chintaa jaahir karata he, ladi makebeth uski mardaangi ko chunauti dekar antat use apni yojana kaa paalan karne ke liye manaa leti he
 Macbeth kills Duncan on the night of the king's arrival
 yah krity kisi kii najar main nahin aata he, lekin yah makebeth ko is kadar jhakzor detaa he ki ladi makebeth ko prabhaar lene ke liye aage aana padataa he
 According to her plan, she puts the bloody daggers on Duncan's sleeping servants and accuses them of murder
 agali subah sabere scotland ke ek rais, lenokes or fiff kaa vafaadaar sardaar macdaf vahaan pahunchate hai
 a concierge opens the gate and Macbeth leads them to the king's chamber where Macduff discovers Duncan's corpse
 isse pehle ki rakshak apni begunaahi ke liye pratirodh kar saken ek banaavati gusse kaa bhav banaakar makebeth unki htya kar detaa he
 Macduff immediately suspects Macbeth but does not publicly reveal his apprehension
 apane jivan ke bhay se dancan ke beton main se mailkam, england or donolabain ireland bhaag jate hai
 The escape of the real heir makes him suspicious and Macbeth sits on the throne as a relative of the dead king, becoming the new King of Scotland
 apni safalataa ke baavjood makebeth bainko kii bhavishyavaanee ko lekar asahaj bana rahata he
 So Macbeth invites him to a royal banquet and learns that Banquo and his young son Flens will go out that night
 He assigns two men to kill them while a third murderer also appears in the park before the murder
 jabaki hatyare bainko ko maar dete hai, fleens bhaag jaataa he
 Banquo's ghost enters the banquet and sits in Macbeth's place
 keval makebeth hi is kaali chaaya ko dekh saktaa he; ek khaali kursi par bhadakte hue makebeth kii drushti main aatank chaa jaataa he jab hataash ladi makebeth use vahaan se chale jane kaa aadesh detii he
 The troubled Macbeth once again meets the three witches
 ve teen atirikt chetavaniyon or bhavishyavaaniyon ke saath apane jaadu se teen atmaaon ko prakat karti hai jo use "macdaf se saavdhaan" rahane ke liye kahati hai lekin saath hi yah bhi kahati hai ki "kisi bhi mahila se paidaa hua vyakti makebeth ko koi nuksaan nahin pahunchayegaa" or vah "kabhi parajeet nahin hoga jab tak ki oonchi dunsinen hill kaa great birnam wood uske khilaaf nahin aa jayega
 chunki macdaf england main nirvaasan main he, makebeth maanata he ki vah surakshit he; isliye vah macdaf kii patni or unke chote bacchon sahit macdaf ke mahal main maujuud prayek vyakti ko maar detaa he
 Lady Macbeth becomes mad at the burden of the crimes committed by her and her husband
 vah har samay un bhayanak baton ko doharaati rahati he, neend main chalane lagati he or apane haathon se kaalpanik khun ke dhabbon ko dhone kii koshish karti he
 In England, Macduff is informed by Ross that "your palace is astonished; your wife and children have been brutally killed
" " makebeth ab ek taanashaah ke rup main dekha jaataa he or uske kai sardaar use chhodkar chale jate hai
 Malcolm leads an army against Macduff and the English Seward, Earl of Northumberland against Dunsignan Castle
 jabaki bernam wood main deraa daalkar baithe sainikon ko pedo kii tahaniyon ko katkar or unhen saath lekar apni sankhya ko chhipaane kaa aadesh diya jaataa he, is prakaar chudilon kii teesri bhavishyavaanee puri hoti he
 In the meantime Macbeth makes a trance on his learning of Lady Macbeth's death

 Macbeth claims arrogantly that he has no need to fear because he cannot be killed by any woman-born man
 macdaf yah ghoshnaa karata he ki vah "apni maan kii kokh se / samay se pehle chira lagaakar paidaa hua tha" or is tarah "kisi mahila se paidaa nahin hua tha"

 Scholars have seen this change of Shakespeare as adding the dark side of Macbeth's crime as the worst crime of hospitality

 Shakespeare intertwined the story of Donwald and King Duff in a way that proved to be an important change for the story

 In Shakespeare's time, Banquo was considered a direct ancestor of Stuart King James
 aitihaasik sroton main chitrit bainko shakespeare dwaara rachit bainko se kaaphi alag he
 Critics have cited several reasons for this change
 sabase pehle raja ke purvaj ko ek khooni ke rup main chitrit karnaa jokhim bharaa ho saktaa tha
 Other writers of the time who wrote about Banquo, such as Jean de Shelandre, have changed history by portraying Banquo not as a murderer but an aristocrat in his work Stuartide, probably for the same reason
 doosraa yah ki shakespeare ne sif isliye bainko ke paatr main badlaav kiya ho saktaa he ki htya ke liye anya saathi ke rup main kisi naatakeey paatr kii koi jarurat nahin thi; haalanki makebeth ko ek naatakeey badlaav die jane kii jarurat thi - ek aisi bhoomika jiske bare main kai vidwaanon kaa tark he ki bainko dwaara puri kii gayi he
 Macbeth cannot be definitively dated due to significant evidence of later revisions
 kai vidwaanon kaa anumaan he ki isaki rachana kii sambhavit tithi 1603 or 1606 ke bich he
 Just as the play seems to commemorate King James's ancestors and Stuart's ascension to the throne in 1603, they argue that the play is unlikely to have been composed before 1603 and suggests that the eight kings The parade - which Chudellay portrays Macbeth in a scene in role IV - complements King James

 Scholars also cite an amusing scene by King James in Oxford in the summer of 1605 that featured three "chudels" like the Sorceress sisters; Karamode speculates that Shakespeare may have heard of it and mentioned it by accident with the Sorceress sisters

 Macbeth was first printed in the First Folio of 1623, and this folio is the sole source of this text
 jo paathya saamagree astitv main he use baad ke logon dwaara sidhe taur par badal diya gaya tha
 Most notable is the inclusion of two songs in Thomas Middleton's play The Witch; Middleton is speculated to have added an additional scene involving Witches and Hecate, as these scenes became quite popular among viewers
 in sanshodhano ko jinhen 1869 ke cleyardon ke sanskaran ke baad se bhoomika III, drishy v kii sampurna hisse or bhoomika IV, drishy i ke ek hisse ko shaamil kiya gaya mana jaataa he, inhen aksar aadhunik paathya samagriyon main darshaya jaataa he
 On this basis, many scholars reject all three scenes with the goddess Hecate as unnatural

 Macbeth is somewhat critical of an inconsistency in Shakespeare's bereavement plays
 sankshep main: yah othelo or king lear se ek hajaar se adhik line kam or hemelet se keval aadhe se thodaa adhik lanbaa he
 This brevity suggests to many critics that the received version is based on a heavily truncated version that would presumably be a dialogue book for a particular performance
 is sankshiptata ko anya asaamaanya visheshtaon se bhi joda gaya he: pehali bhoomika kaa pehla ansh, jo aisa lagata he ki "ection ke liye ujagar kiya gaya" he; makebeth ke alaava anya paatro kii tulanaatmak saralata; shakespeare ke anya dukhaant nayakon kii tulana main swayan makebeth kii vichitrataa
 At least since the days of Alexander Pope and Samuel Johnson the analysis of the play has been focused on the question of Macbeth's ambition, which is generally seen to dominate the story so much that it defines the character
 johnson ne kaha tha ki haalanki makebeth ko uski sainya bahaduree ke liye sammanit kiya jaataa he lekin puri tarah se dhikkara jaataa he
 This idea appears repeatedly in critical literature and, according to Caroline Spurgeon, is itself supported by Shakespeare who apparently wanted to degrade his hero for whom he put him in a cloak unsuitable for him and the many nimisms he used i want to make Macbeth look ridiculous; His clothes are either too big or too small for him - just as his ambition for his new and rightful role as king is huge and his character too small
 jab chudilon kii bhavishyavaanee ke anusaar codor ke then kii apni nayi oopaadhi ke baad vah apane aap ko "udhaar ke kapade pahane" mahasoos karata he, jisaki pushti ross dwaara kii gayi he, bainko kahata he: "sanyogvash use milane vaale nae sammaan hamaare ajeeb vastron kii hi tarah, uske naap ke nahin hai, isliye unhen kuch chizon kii sahaayta se pahana jaataa he" 
 or ant main, jab taanashaah dunsinen main palat kar muqabla karne ko baadhya hota he, kaithanes use ek bade vastra ko ek bahut hi choti belt se baandhne kii vyarth koshish karne vaale aadmi ke samaan dekhtaa he: "vah apane vikrut kaaran ko niyantrit nahin kar saktaa he / shashan samaan belt ke dwaara", jabaki anges isi tarah ke ek udhaaharan main is prakaar kaa saar prastut karte hai jo makebeth ke satarudh hone ke baad har hoi sochataa he: kya ab use apni oopaadhi apane liye kaaphi badi dikhaai de rahi he, thik usee tarah jaise ek vishalkay vyakti kaa labaade ek thigane chor ke upar" 
 Like Richard III but without that character's perversely charming excess, Macbeth remains blood-soaked until his inevitable downfall
 jaisaa ki kenneth muir likhte hai, "makebeth kii pravriti hatya karne kii nahin hoti he; uski sirf ek atyadhik mahatvakanksha he jo apane aap main aisa lagata he ki htya ko rajgaddi paane main vifaltaa kii tulana main ek chota paap he
 Some critics such as E

 Stoll describes this characterization as a relic of Senecan or medieval tradition

 Yet the question of Macbeth's inspiration to other critics has not been so easy to solve
 udhaaharan ke liye robert brijes ne ek virodhabhas ko mahasoos kiya tha: dancan kii htya se pehle is tarah ke yatharthpurna aatank ko vyakt karne main sakasham ek paatr sambhawatah is tarah ke aparaadh ko anjaam dene main asamarth hoga
 kai aalochakon ke liye pehali bhoomika main makebeth kii preranaayen aspasht or aparyaapt dikhaai detii hai
 John Dover Wilson's hypothesis was that Shakespeare's original text had one or several additional scenes where the husband and wife debated their plans
 is vyakhya puri tarah se saadhy nahin he; haalanki makebeth kii mahatvakanksha kii bhoomika kii prerak bhoomika ko saarvbhaumik manyata praapt he
 The acts of wickedness inspired by his ambition seem to entangle him in a cycle of increasing wickedness, as Macbeth himself recognizes: "I am in blood / so far gone that i should not move any further / Returning It was as hard as moving forward
 " makebeth kii mahatvakanksha ke vinaashkari parinaam usee tak simit nahin hai
 The play depicts Scotland as a country distracted by events contrary to the natural order almost from the time of the assassination

 Macbeth's generally accepted gratitude for medieval tragedy is often seen as important in the play's description of the moral order
 glen vikaham is naatak ko darban ke madhyam se narak ke khaufnak kathanak par ek rahasmay naatak se jodate hai
 Howard Felperin argues that the play has a far more complex tendency toward "orthodox Christian tragedy" than its often accepted position; They see a connection between dictator roles within the drama and medieval liturgical drama

 Some feminist psychoanalytic critics such as Janet Edelman have associated the play's conduct with gendered roles in contrast to its larger theme of naturalistic arrangements

 Critics in the early twentieth century reacted against the situation which they saw as an excessive reliance on the study of character in their criticism of the play
 haalanki yah nirbharta sabase adhik kareebi taur par andrew cesil bradli se sambhddha he jo kam se kam mairi couden clark ke samay tak spasht ho jaati he jinhone shakespeare kii pramukh mahila bhoomikaaon ke naatak-purv jivan ke sandarbh main sateek, agar kaalpanik vivaran prastut kiya
 For example, he suggested that the girl Lady Macbeth in the first role refers to death during a senseless military action

 They are so deeply secure in both worlds that it is unclear whether they control fate or whether they are just agents of it

 Lines of witches in the first role: "truth is dishonest and dishonesty is fair: go through fog and polluted air" This is often called a fixed tone for the rest of the play, arranging as a sense of confusion 
 darasal naatak aisi paristhitiyon se bharpoor he jahaan dushtataa ko achchhai ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya he jabaki achchhai ko dushtataa kaa rup diya gaya he
 The line "double, double exertion and trouble," clearly convey the intent of witches: they only want trouble for the humans around them

 By establishing this idea in her mind, she effectively directs her on her path of destruction

 He argued that first a thought is filled in a person's mind, then that person either indulges in this idea or rejects it

 According to Bryant Jr
, Macbeth can also be considered a metaphor - especially as a metaphor for portions of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible
 From some Christian Aspects of Shakespeare: bryant raja dancan kii hatya or isa messiah kii hatya ke bich kuch gahari samaantaaon kii khoj main chale jate hai jabaki lekin ek aakasmik prekshak ke liye naatak main bible sambandhi anya rupakon kaa ullekh karnaa kahi aasaan hota he
 The fall of Macbeth is largely similar to the fall of the man in Genesis 3, and his return to witches for advice directly parallels the story of King Saul in 1 Samuel 28
 shakespeare ke darshakon ne inhen turant uthaa liya hoga or naatak evam bible ke bich aage ke samanantaron kii jaanch is lekhan ke liye shakespeare ke iraadon main atirikt antardrushti prastut karata he
 Although many people today would speak of a misfortune around a construction of a straightforward coincidence, actors and other people in the theater often consider it a misfortune to mention Macbeth's name within the theater and sometimes refer to it indirectly
 Huh
 udhaaharan ke liye "da scottish play", yaa "mikabi", yaa jab paatr kaa sandarbh dena ho naa ki naatak kaa, "mistar and misses em" yaa "da scottish king" kaa prayog
 This is because Shakespeare is said to have used the utterances of real witches in his creation, which allegedly angered the witches, and for that reason the play was cursed
 is prakaar kisi theatre ke andar naatak ke naam kaa prayog nirmaan kii vifaltaa kii sthiti tak vinaashkari mana jaataa he or sambhawatah abhinay varg ke sadasyon ko shaareerik chot lagane yaa mrityu kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 There are stories of accidents, misfortunes and even deaths during the operations of Macbeth

 kyonki in dangon kaa kaaran makebeth ke do abhinay pradarshnon ke ek sangharsh par aadhaarit tha, ise aksar abhishaap ke kaaran hua mana jaataa he
 Depending on the actor, several methods exist to erase this curse
 maaikel york se sambandhit ek tarika he, jis vyakti ne is naam kaa uccharan kiya he uske saath us bhawan ko turant chhod dena jahaan vah stage bana he, teen baar uske chaaron ore ghoomana, uske baayen kandhe par thukna, ek ashleelata kii baat kahana or uske baad bhawan main waapas aamantrit kiye jane ke liye pratiksha karnaa he
 a related practice is to move around three times as fast as possible with that sometimes spitting on their shoulders and saying an obscene thing
 ek anya lokapriy "rivaaj" he kamare ko chhod dena, teen baar dastak dena, aamantrit kiya janaa or uske baad hemelet kii ek pankti bolnaa
 iske alaava ek or rivaaj he da marchent of venice kii panktiyon ko sunaanaa, jise ek saubhagyashaalee naatak mana jaataa he
 No examples of Shakespearean era acting performances are definitively known except as described in Foreman's document

 The brevity of the play and some aspects of its staging suggest that the current text was probably modified for indoor construction at the Blackfriars Theater that the King's people received in 1608
 restauration main sar wiliam devenent ne ek makebeth ke ek shandaar "opera sambandhi" roopantaran kaa nirmaan kiya tha jisamen "sabhi gaanon or nrityon" or "chudilon ke liye udne" jaise special effects kaa prayog kiya gaya tha

 In an entry in his diary on 19 April 1667, Samuel Pepys called Davenant's Macbeth "one of the best plays for the theater and the variety of dance and music I've ever seen"
 Davenant's version continued to dominate the stage until the middle of the next century
 18veen sadi kii shuruyaat ke prasiddh macbaith jaise ki james queen ne is sanskaran kaa prayog kiya tha
 Charles Macklin, who is not otherwise remembered as a great Macbeth, is remembered for his acting in Covent Garden in 1773 which is related to Macklin's rivalry with Garrick and William Smith
 maclin ne scottish poshaak main abhinay kiya tha jo makebeth ko angreji brigadier ke rup main veshbhusha pehanaane ke pehle ke prachlan ke vipareet he; unhone gairik ke maut ke sanvaadon ko bhi hataa diya tha or aage ladi macdaf ke bhoomika ko kaat diya tha
 The performance received generally respectful reviews, although George Stevens commented on Macklin's inappropriateness for the role
 gairik ke baad 18veen sadi kaa sabase adhik saraahneey makebeth the jon philip kemble; unhone is bhoomika ko sabase adhik lokapriy rup se apni bahan, sara sidans ke saath nibhaayaa jinaki ladi makebeth ko sarvotkrisht mana jaataa he
 Kemble continued the trend toward realistic dress and the language of Shakespeare that marked Macklin's creation; Walter Scott states that he experimented relentlessly with the play's Scottish costumes
 kemble qi vyakhya par pratikriya vibhajit thi; haalanki sidans qi sarvasammati se prashansa kii gayi thi
 His role in the scene "walking in sleep" was particularly mentioned in the fifth part; Leah Hunt called it "excellent"
 kemble-siddons' roles were the first widely influential productions in which Lady Macbeth's villain was portrayed as deeper and more powerful than Macbeth

 In contrast to Camble's insistence on a decent form of Macbeth, he presents him as a ruthless politician who collapses under the weight of guilt and fear
 haalanki keen ne drishy or veshbhusha main apvyay kii ore badhati pravriti ko rokane ke liye kuch nahin kiya
 The next influential London actor, William Charles Macready's Macbeth, at least provoked mixed reactions from Keane
 Macready made his role in Covent Garden in 1820
 jaisaa ki hazlit ne ullekh kiya tha, is paatr ke bare main makerady kii paathya saamagree vishuddh rup se manovaigyanik thi; chudilon ne apni apni samast alokik shaktiyaan kho di thim or makebeth ke patan kii shuruyaat shuddh rup se makebeth ke charitra main ho rahe sangharsh se hui thi
 Macready's most famous Lady Macbeth was Helena Fossitt, who made her debut in the role as a disappointment when she was in her 20s, but later received acclaim for a treat that, unlike Sidons, the woman's dignity Was in keeping with contemporary sentiments
 makerady ke "sevanivruth" hokar america chale jane ke baad unhone is bhoomika main abhinay karnaa jari rakhaa; 1849 main ve america abhinayta edwin forest ke saath ek pratidwandvita main shaamil ho gaye, jinke pakshapaaton ne makerady ko aster place main dhakel diya jiske kaaran vah ghatana ghatit hui jise saamanytah aster place rhit kaha jaataa he
 Two of the most important Macbeths of the mid-century, Samuel Phelps and Charles Kean, both achieved significant ambivalence and popular success
 donon manchan ke kuch pahaluon kii tulana main is paatr kii apni-apni vyakhyaaon ke liye prasiddh hai
 Saddlers brought back almost all of Phelps Shakespeare's lessons at the Wells Theater
 unhone darban ke drishy ke prathamarddh ko waapas laa diya jise devenant ke baad ke nirdeshkon ne nazarandaaj kar diya tha; duusare ko uske foohad vyavhaar ke kaaran kataa hua chhod diya gaya tha
 He dropped the added music and had reduced the roles of witches in the folios
 thik isi tarah mahatvapurn rup se ve makebeth kii maut ke pholio sambandhi prayog main waapas aaye the
 Not all of these decisions were carried forward in the Victorian context, and Phelps experimented with various combinations of Shakespeare and Davenant in more than a dozen of his works between 1844 and 1861

 Among them, his detractors such as Henry James expressed regret at his arbitrary word changes and "nousthenic" and "short-tempered" attitudes toward the character

 The Navayans are a sect of Buddhism, built by the Indian Buddhist leader Bhimrao Ambedkar
 navyan kaa arth he - "nayaa maarg" yaa "shuddh vaahan"
 All the followers of this Buddhism are "ambedkarite Buddhists", these Buddhists are considered to be compulsory and important to follow the twenty-two vows prescribed by Ambedkar, which Ambedkar gave the conversion ceremony of 14 October 1956
 ambedkar ke in dharm parivarthit buddha anuyaayion ko bharat sarkaar tathaa anya rajya rajya sarkaron ne "navabuddha" naamak sangya de rakhi hai
 The Navayana sects Mahayana, Theravada and Vajrayana etc
 differ in some respects, but in this only the scientific principles and the rational / rational principles are taken with the basic principles of Buddha out of these three sects
 navyan main jatipratha, varnbhed, lingabhed, andhvishwaas tathaa kuritiyon ko koi sthaan nahin hai
 As of 2011, Navyani Buddhists constitute the majority, or 87%, of the total Indian Buddhists
 anya anumaano ke anusaar, bharat main bharat main navayani baudhon kii aabaadi 5 se 7 karod tak hai
 a day before Ambedkar accepted Buddhism, the journalist asked, 'will Buddhist religion or Hinayana Buddhism be the one you adopt?' In reply Ambedkar said, "my Buddhism will neither be Mahayana nor Hinayana, there are some superstitious things in these two sects, so my Buddhism will be Navyaan Buddhism
" jisamen kisi buddha ke mul siddhant or keval vivekwaadi siddhant hi honge, koi bhi kuritiyon yaa andhvishwaas nahin honga
 It will be a 'pure Buddhism'
 ’’ patrkaar ne phir poochhaan, “kya ham ise 'bhimyan' kah sakate hai?” ambedkar ne kaha kii, aap kah sakate hai kintu main nahin kahunga
 Because i don't want to bring myself up like Gautama Buddha
 haalanki bharat ke navayani buddha bodhisattva ambedkar tathaa gautam buddha ko hi sanmaan dete he, kyonki ve ambedkar ko apane aadhyatmik netaa tathaa buddha ko apane guru maanate he
 In present-day India whenever Lord Buddha is remembered, then naturally Bhimrao Ambedkar is also named
 bhartiya swatantraaa ke baad bahut badi sankhya main ek saath dow ambedkar ke netritv main samudayik buddha dhamm parivartan hua tha
 The initiation took place in Nagpur on October 14, 1956, in which 5,00,000 supporters of Ambedkar became Buddhists, the next day 2,00,000 and on the third day on October 16, 300,000 followers became Buddhists in Chandrapur
 is tarah 10 lakh se bhi adhik logon to ambedkar ne keval teen din main buddha banaaya tha
 This event led to the revival or rebirth of Buddhism in India
 ek anumaan ke anusaar march 1959 tak 1
5 se 2 karod log buddha bane the
 Buddhism is one of the major religions of India and informally is the third largest religion in India
 bhagwaan buddha or unka dhamm yah bhartiya buddha anuyaayion kaa dharmagranth hai, jise dow bhimrao ambedkar ne likhaa hai
 Apart from this, Tripitaka and Adi Buddhist texts are considered important by Buddhist followers

 This proves that the status of women in Buddhist families is far superior to that of Hindu Dalits

 The rate for Buddhists is the highest at 40
6 percent, compared to 40
4 percent for Hindu Dalits
 yah dar hinduon, musalamaanon isai, sikh kii tulana main bhi adhik he, or jain 
 This proves that Buddhism is more employed than Hindu Dalits
 isse pataa chalata hai kii, shoshiton evam daliton ke netaa dow bhimrao ambedkar ji ne daliton ke utthan yaa pragati ke liye jo mahaan buddhavaad swayan sweekaar kiya tha 
 And others were also advised to accept Buddhism
 or yah daliton ke pida harne main sahi sabit hua hai
 However, today only a small proportion of Dalits have adopted Buddhism, and these Buddhist groups are becoming better and better than Hindu Dalits

 The last of the five emperors was Emperor Shun

 It was also called the Shia dynasty followed by the Shang dynasty, which lasted from 1600 BCE to 1046 BCE

 If seen globally, Confucius thought in China during the time of Gautama Buddha, Vedic and Buddha thought in India and Zarathustra ideology in Iran, the rest of the world was almost non-existent except Greece
 na isai dharm tha or na islam
 Before the birth of Jesus Christ, the echo of Buddhism had reached Jerusalem
 china main jhou rajvansh kaa kaal lambey samay tak chalaa
 During these times, Confucian thought and Buddhism developed in China
 baad main tao vaad, mohivaad or nyaayawad bhi khub phala-phula
 But in the midst of all this, Buddhism had its roots and it tied different ideologies of China in one thread
 buddha dharm ke kaaran china main jatigat ekta or shakti kaa vikaas hua
 The spread of this ideology led to the rise of the Chin Dynasty with the abolition of slavery in China
 chhin ke baad haan ne 8veen sadi tak rajya kiya
 In the earlier period of development of all these dynasties and religion and philosophy, China was named Harivarsha
 bhartiya dharmagranthon ke anusaar use harivarsh kaha jaataa tha
 King Agnighra of Jambudeep had 9 sons - Navel, Kimpurush, Harivarsha, Ilavrita, Ramya, Hiranyamay, Kuru, Bhadrashava and Ketumal

 In the nineteenth century, the prose of Hindi prose-making and the Hindi-propaganda movement, despite facing severe hardships under the most adverse conditions, the evidence of how fast and athletic it is is evident on the dilapidated pages of 'bharatamitra' 'saar Sudhanidhi' and 'proper speaker'

 Earlier, English journalism dominated the country and abroad, but today the flag of Hindi language is waving
 30 may ko 'hindi patrakarita diwas' ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 Modern-day journalism was born in India in the fourth phase of the eighteenth century in Calcutta, Bombay and Madras
 1780 i
 main prakashit hike kaa "kalakatta gazat" kadachit is ore pehla praytn tha
 anglo-indian English journalism of these cities had developed greatly by the time the first Hindi letter Udant Martand was published
 in antim varshon main farsi bhashaa main bhi patrakarita kaa janm ho chukaa tha
 Persian letters of the 18th century were probably handwritten letters
 1801 main 'hindostaan intelligence oriental anthology' naam kaa jo sankalan prakashit hua usamen uttar bharat ke kitne hi "akhabaaron" ke uddhran the
 In 1810 Maulvi Ikram Ali started publishing the Leitho letter "hindostani" from Calcutta
 1816 main gangakishor bhattacharya ne "bengal gajet" kaa pravartan kiya
 This was the first Bengali letter
 baad main shrirampur ke padariyon ne prasiddh prachaarpatr "samachar darpan" ko janm diya
 After these initial letters, in 1823, we get to see 'newschandraika' and "samvad Kaumudi" in Bengali language, "jame Jahanuma" and "shamsul Akhbar" in Persian Urdu and "mumbai Samachar" in Gujarati
 yah spasht he ki hindi patrakarita bahut baad kii cheez nahin he
 Delhi's "urdu Newspaper" and Marathi's "digdarshan" came only after Hindi's first letter "udant Martand"
 "udant martand" ke sampadak pandit jugalkishor the
 It was a weekly paper
 patr kii bhashaa pachhanhi hindi rahati thi, jise patr ke sampadakon ne "madhyadeshiy bhashaa" kaha he
 The letter closed in 1827
 un dinon sarkari sahaayta ke bina kisi bhi patr kaa chalanaa asambhav tha
 The company government had given the facility of postage etc
 to the missionaries' letter, but even after trying, "udant Martand" could not get this facility
 1826 i
 se 1873 i
 tak ko ham hindi patrakarita kaa pehla charan kah sakate hai
 In 1873, Bhartendu founded the "harishchandra Magazine"
 ek varsh baad yah patr "harishchandra chandrika" naam se prasiddh hua
 By the way, Bhartendu's "kavyashakha Sudha" paper came out in 1867 itself and he took an important part in the development of journalism; But the new language style was introduced in 1873 only from "harishchandra Magazine"
 is bich ke adhikansh patr prayog maatr kahe ja sakate hai or unke peeche patrakala kaa gyaan athwa nae vichaaron ke prachaar kii bhaavana nahin he
 The major letters after "udant Martand" are: in patron main se kuch masik the, kuch saptahik
 The daily paper had only one "news Corruption" which was bilingual and published from Calcutta
 yah dainik patr 1871 tak chalata rahaa
 Most of the letters were published from Agra which was a big educational center in those days and the students met the needs of the society
 shesh brahmsamaj, sanathan dharm or mishnariyon ke prachaar kaary se sambandhit the
 Many of the letters were bilingual and some were even bilingual
 isse bhi patrakarita kii aparipakv dasha hi suchit hoti he
 The "banaras Newspaper" was very influential in the early letters of Hindi Pradesh and in protest against its linguistic language, Taramohan Maitra started publishing the weekly "sudhakar" from Kashi in 1850 and Raja Lakshman Singh from Agra in 1855 from Prajitha
 raja shivaprasad kaa "banaras akhbaar" urdu bhashastyli ko apanaataa tha to ye donon patr panditau tatsampradhan style kii ore jhukate the
 Thus we see that before 1867 Hindi journalists could not follow a certain style in relation to the language style
 is varsh 'kavi vachansudha' kaa prakaashan hua or ek tarah se ham use pehla mahatvapurn patr kah sakate hai
 At first it was monthly, then fortnightly and finally weekly
 bharatendu ke bahuvidh vyaktitv kaa prakaashan is patr ke madhyam se hua, parantu sach to yah he ki "harishchandra magazine" ke prakaashan tak ve bhi bhashastyli or vichaaron ke kshetra main maarg hi khojate dikhaai dete hai
 The second era of Hindi journalism runs from 1873 to 1900
 is yug ke ek chor par bharatendu kaa "harishchandra magazine" tha ore nagariprachaarini sabha dwaara anumodanprapt "saraswati"
 The number of papers published in these 27 years is above 300-350 and extends to Nagpur
 adhikansh patr masik yaa saptahik the
 The monthly papers used to have some more permanent assets in the form of essays, Naval Katha, talks etc
, but most of the papers did not go more than 10-15 pages and we can call them "thought sheets" in today's words
 saptahik patron main samaacharon or unpar tippaniyon kaa bhi mahatvapurn sthaan tha
 In fact, there was no special request for the daily news at that time and perhaps that's why the weekly and monthly papers were more important in those days
 unhone janajagran main atyant mahatvapurn bhaag liya tha
 The ideal of these 25 years of the nineteenth century was Bharatendu's journalism
 "kavivachansudha", "harishchandra magazine", shri harishchandra chandrika", balbodhini ke rup main bharatendu ne is disha main pathpradarshan kiya tha
 Frustrated by his commentaries, and angry at the "punch" of "kavikhaवचनasudha", the magistrate of Kashi also stopped taking Bharatendu's letters to the education department
 isamen andeh nahin ki patrakarita ke kshetra bhi bharatendu purnataya nirbhik the or unhone nae nae patron ke liye protsaahan diya
 He also named many letters like "hindi Pradeep", "bharat Jeevan"
 unke yug ke sabhi patrkaar unhen agrani maanate the
 Prominent among the journalists who came to this field after Bharatendu were Pandit Rudradutt Sharma, Balakrishna Bhatt, Durgaprasad Mishra, Pandit Sadanand Mishra, Pandit Vanshidhar, Badrinarayan Chaudhary "prem Dhan", Devkinandan Tripathi, Radhacharan Goswami, Pandit Gauridapan, Raja Raman Singh, Prata
 Mishra, Ambikadatta Vyas, Babu Ramakrishna Verma, Pt
 Ramgoolam Awasthi, Yogeshchandra Vasu, Pt
 Kundanlal and Babu Devakinandan Woman and Babu Jagnnathdas
 1895 i
 main "nagariprachaarini patrika" kaa prakaashan aarambh hota he
 Critical literary review started from this magazine and hence we can consider it a definite lighthouse
 1900 i
 main "saraswati" or "sudarshan" ke avataran ke saath hindi patrakarita ke is duusare yug par patakshep ho jaataa he
 In these 25 years, Hindi journalism developed in many directions
 praarambhik patr shikshaprasar or dharmprachaar tak simit the
 Bharatendu also developed social, political and literary directions
 unhone hi "balabodhini" naam se pehla stri-masik-patr chalaaya
 a few years later, women see themselves entering the region - "bharatabhini", "sugrihini"
 in varshon main dharm ke kshetra main aryasamaj or sanathan dharm ke prachaarak vishesh sakriy the
 Some letters related to Brahmasamaja and Radhaswami faith and some Christian religious letters from Christian centers like Mirzapur also appear, but we find the religious reactions of the era only in the letters of Aryasamaj and mythology
 aaj ye patr kadachit utane mahatvapurn nahin jaan padate, parantu isamen andeh nahin ki unhone hindi kii gadhyshailee ko pusht kiya or janata main nae vichaaron kii jyoti bhi
 As a result of these religious debates, various sections of the society and sect went towards reform and very soon there was a flood of communal letters
 saikadon kii sankhya main vibhinn jaateey or vargeey patr prakashit hue or unhone asankhya janon ko vaani di
 Today, the same letters are very important in our historiography, who have done some outstanding work in the field of language style, literature or politics
 saahitiyik drushti se "hindi pradeep", brahman, kshatriyapatrika, anandakadambini, bharatendu, devanagari prachaarak, vaishnav patrika, kavi ke chitrakaar, nagari nirad, sahitya sudhanidhi or raajnneetik drushti se bharatamitra, uchit vaktaa, saar sudhanidhi, bharatoday, bharat jivan, bharatoday, shubhachintak or hindi bangavasi vishesh mahatvapurn hai
 These papers have preserved the best of our 19th-century literature, rasikas, karmat worshipers of Hindi, stylists and thinkers
 yah kshobh kaa vishay he ki ham is mahatvapurn saamagree kaa patron kii filon se uddhaar nahin kar sake
 How many essays, commentaries, articles, panches, haps and sketches and sketches of living writers like Balakrishna Bhatt, Pratapnarayan Mishra, Sadanam Mishra, Rudradatta Sharma, Ambikadatta Vyas and Balamukund Gupta are getting us to the mark today
 aaj bhi hamaare patrkaar unase bahut kuch sikh sakate hai
 He was a pioneer in his time
 beesvin shatabdi kii patrakarita hamaare liye apekshaakrit nikat he or usamen bahut kuch pichley yug kii patrakarita kii hi vividhta or bahurupata milti he
 Journalists of the 19th century had to face chaos in the language-style arena
 unhen ek ore angreji or duusari ore urdu ke patron ke saamne apni vastu rakhni thi
 Right now the people interested in Hindi were very small
 dhire-dhire paristhiti badali or ham hindi patron ko sahitya or raajnneeti ke kshetra main netritv karte pate hai
 From this century onwards, the movement of religion and social reforms fell behind and the caste consciousness gradually assumed the form of national consciousness
 falat: adhikansh patr, sahitya or raajnneeti ko hi lekar chale
 The first two decades in the field of literary papers were led by "saraswati" edited by Acharya Dwivedi
 vastut: in bees varshon main hindi ke masik patr ek mahaan saahitiyik shakti ke rup main saamne aae
 a number of papers were published in the form of a novel novel Kahani - such as Novel 1901, Hindi Naavil 1901, Novel Lahari 1902, Novel Sea 1903, Novel Kusumnjali 1904, Novel Bahar 1907, Novel Promotion 19012
 keval kavita athwa samasyapurti lekar anek patr unnisvin shatbdi ke antim varshon main nikalne lage the
 They went on
 samalochna ke kshetra main "samalochak" or aitihaasik shodh se sambandhit "itihaas" kaa prakaashan bhi mahatvapurn ghatnaayen hai
 But Saraswati's ideal as "missleni" was more popular and a few letters can be named with him in the letters of this category, such as "bharatendu", Nagri Hitaishini Patrika, Bankipur, Nagrikaprakash, Mithilamihir and Indu
 "saraswati" or "indu" donon hindi kii sahityachetana ke itihaas ke liye mahatvapurn hai or ek tarah se ham unhen us yug kii saahitiyik patrakarita kaa sheershamani kah sakate hai
 Through "saraswati", Acharya Mahavirprasad Dwivedi and "indu" through Pandit Rupnarayan Pandey, the editorial vigilance, perseverance and honesty that he set before us was able to give a new direction to Hindi journalism
 parantu raajnneetik kshetra main hindi patrakarita ko netritv praapt nahin ho sakaa
 The center of political journalism of the previous era was Calcutta
 parantu kalakatta hindi pradesh se dur padataa tha or swayan hindi pradesh ko raajnneetik disha main jaagruk netritv kuch der main mila
 The first daily Hindi Hindi state of Raja Rampal Singh's bilingual "hindustan" was published in English and Hindi from Kalakankar
 do varsh baad, babu seetaram ne "bharatoday" naam se ek dainik patr kanpur se nikaalnaa shuru kiya
 But both these papers could not be long lasting and the weekly papers had to become the vehicle of political ideology
 vastav main unnisvin shatbdi main kalakatta ke bharat mitra, vangvasi, sarasudhanidhi or uchit vaktaa hi hindi pradesh kii ranithik bhaavana kaa pratinidhitiv karte the
 Perhaps "bharatamitra" was the most enduring and powerful of these
 unnisvin shatabdi main bengal or maharashtra lok jagrati ke centre the or ugr rashtriya patrakarita main bhi ye hi praant agrani the
 The journalists of Hindi Pradesh accepted the leadership of these provinces and their independent political personality could not develop for a long time
 phir bhi ham "abhyuday", "pratap", "karmyogi", "hindi kesari" aadi ke rup main hindi raajnneetik patrakarita ko kai dag aage badhaate pate hai
 The excitement of the First World War once again led to several daily letters
 kalakatta se "kalakatta samachar", "swatantra" or "vishwamitra" prakashit hue, bombai se "venkateshwar samachar" ne apana dainik sanskaran prakashit karnaa aarambh kiya or dilli se "vijay" niklaa
 In 1921 "today" from Kashi and "present" from Kanpur were published
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki 1921 main hindi patrakarita phir ek baar karavatein leti he or raajnneetik kshetra main apana nayaa jivan aarambh karti he
 New trends in our literary papers also start from this time
 falat: beesvin shatee ke pehle bees varshon ko ham hindi patrakarita kaa teesraa charan kah sakate hai
 After 1921, the contemporary era of Hindi journalism begins
 is yug main ham rashtriya or saahitiyik chetana ko saath saath pallavit pate hai
 Around the same time, Hindi was entered into universities and some Kriti editors came to know who were fully familiar with the journalism of English and who wanted to bring Hindi papers at par with the letters of English, Marathi and Bengali
 falat: saahitiyik patrakarita main ek nae yug kaa aarambh hua
 National movements declared qualification for the national language of Hindi for the first time and as the strength of national movements started increasing, Hindi journalists and letters started gaining more importance
 1921 ke baad gandhi ji ke netritv main rashtriya andolan madhyavarg tak simit na rahakar graminon or shramikon tak pahunch gaya or uske is prasar main hindi patrakarita ne mahatvapurn yoga diya
 The truth is that Hindi journalists were at the forefront of national movements and took a firm stand against foreign authority
 videshi sarkaar ne anek baar nae nae kanoon banaakar samachaarpatron kii swatantraaa par kutharaghaat kiya parantu jail, jurmaana or anekanek maansik or aarthik kathinaaiyaan jhelte hue bhi hindi patrakaron ne swatantra vichaar kii deepashikha jalaae rakhi
 Among the letters that came to the literary field after 1921 are prominent- vastav main aaj hamaare masik sahitya kii praudhata or vividhta main kisi prakaar kaa andeh nahin ho saktaa
 Many first-class works of Hindi came to light first by menstruation and many excellent poets and litterateurs were also related to journalism
 aaj hamaare masik patr jivan or sahitya ke sabhi angon kii purti karte hai or ab visheshgyata kii ore bhi dhyaan jane laga he
 Like the trends of literature, an evolving glimpse is found in the letters, not in books
 vahaan hamen sahitya kaa sakriy, sapraan, gatisheel rup praapt hota he
 In the political arena, the newspapers which were popular in this era are - inamen se adhikansh saptahik hai, parantu janaman ke nirmaan main unka yogadan mahatvapurn rahaa he
 As far as letter art is concerned, we can clearly say that there is a difference of earth and sky in the letters of the third and fourth eras
 aaj patrasampadan vastav main ucch koti kii kala he
 In the field of political journalism, "aaj" and its editor late Baburao Vishnu Paradkar occupies almost the same place as Acharya Mahavirprasad Dwivedi in the field of literary journalism
 sach to yah he ki "aaj" ne patrakala ke kshetra main ek mahaan sanstha kaa kaam kiya he or usne hindi ko bisiyon patrasampadak or patrkaar die hai
 Like many parts of modern literature, Hindi journalism is also a new category and in that it is mainly a reflection of the social, cultural, literary and political movements of our middle class
 vastav main pichley 200 varshon kaa sachcha itihaas hamaari patrapatrikaon se hi sankalit ho saktaa he
 In the "kaler Katha" book of Bengali, an attempt has been made to assess the mid-nineteenth-century life of Bengal based on the descent of letters

 In a way, in the nineteenth century, there is very little that can be called literature and whatever it is, it has appeared first in the pages of letters
 bhashastyli ke nirmaan or jaateey style ke vikaas main patron kaa yogadan atyant mahatvapurn rahaa he, parantu beesvin shatee ke pehle do dashakon ke ant tak masik patr or saptahik patr hi hamaari saahitiyik pravritiyon ko janm dete or viksit karte rahe hai
 The experimental form that we see in the literature of Dwivedi era in "saraswati" and "indu" is the true form of that literature
 1921 i
 ke baad sahitya bahut kuch patrapatrikaon se swatantra hokar apane pairon par khadaa hone laga, parantu phir bhi vishisht saahitiyik andolanon ke liye hamen masik patron ke prishth hi ulatney padate hai
 There are magazinelets for political consciousness
 vastut: patrapatrikas jitani badi jansankhya ko chooti hai, vishuddh sahitya kaa utani badi jansankhya tak pahunchnaa asambhav he
 In the 90s, Indian language newspapers, Hindi journalism, Amar Ujala, Dainik Bhaskar, Dainik Jagran etc
 began to come out from the towns and cities
 jahaan pehle mahanagaron se akhbaar chhapate the, bhumandalikaran ke baad aayi nayi takanic, behatar sadak or yatayaat ke sansadhano kii sulabhta kii vajah se chote shaharon, kasbon se bhi nagar sanskaran kaa chapana aasaan ho gaya
 Also, in these decades, the search for new consumers for new goods started in the market spreading in rural areas and towns

 At the same time local news is prominently featured in these newspaper editions

 Media expert Sevanti Ninan called it a 'reinvention of the public world of Hindi'

 In 1990, the report of the National Reader Survey stated that there was only one Hindi newspaper in the five leading newspapers
 pichley ne sabit kar diya ki ham kitni teji se bad rahe hai
 This time, the first four of the five most read newspapers are in Hindi
 ek utsahjanak baat or bhi he ki iares survey main jin 42 shaharon ko sabase teji se ubharta mana gaya he, unamem se zyaadaatar hindi hriday pradesh ke hai
 It is clear that if the states of the South have increased the tremendous growth of development in the last three decades, then for the next decade we belong to Hindi people
 aisa nahin he ki akhbaar ke adhyayan ke maamle main hi yah pradesh aguva sabit ho rahe hai
 a data from the IT industry shows that the number of people reading and writing on the net in Hindi and Indian languages is increasing continuously
 matlab saaf he
 This expansion of Hindi aspirations is also looking towards journalists
 pragati kii chetana ke saath samaaj kii nichali qatari main baithe log bhi samachar patron kii panktiyon main dikhne chahie
 The results of previous IAS, iits and all education councils have proved that even the people sitting on the lowest steps in Hindi speakers are ready for a big jump
