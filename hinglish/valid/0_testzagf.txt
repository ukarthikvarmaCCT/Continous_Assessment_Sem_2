 Invictus is a short English-language poem written by the British poet William Ernst Han Lee
 'invictus' latini bhashaa kaa shabd he or iskaa arth he 'ajey', yani 'jo kabhi haraaya na ja sake'
 After the publication of this poem some critics said that the word 'invictus' is the slogan of every man who eyes the difficulties of life and faces them fearlessly
 ' William Ernst Han Lee developed tuberculosis at the age of 13
 kuch saalon baad yah badhkar unke paanv tak pahunch gaya or chikitsakon ne kaha ki unhen bachaane ke liye unki taang ko ghutane ke neeche se kaat dena hoga
 In this way, at the age of 17, he lost one of his legs
 stoic vichaardhaara se unhen maansik bal mila or ve is 'invictus' naamak kavita ko likhane ke liye prerit hue
 Despite having a single leg, he led an active and successful life till the age of 53 years
 kavita ke bol or unka arth is prakaar hai: Out of the night that covers me, Black as the pit from pole to pole, i thank whatever gods may befor my unconquerable soul
in the fell clutch of circumstancei have not wonced nor cried aloud
under the bludgeonings of chancemy head is bloody, but unbowed
beyond this place of wrath and tearslooms but the horror of the shade, and yet the menace of the yearsfinds and shall find me unafraid
 fate: i am the captain of my soul
 out of da nite dait kawarz me,blike aiz da pit from pole tu pole ,aae phank whot fevar godz me bifor maae anconcrable sol
in da fal klach of sarkamastans aae haev note vincd nor kride alaud 
under da bljaningaz of fet maae had iz bldid bat anboud 
biond dis place of rai and terz lumz bat da horer of da shed, and yat da manas of da yarz findz and shail find me ackfred
 it matterz note haao street da get ,haao charged vid panishmants da scrol 
aae am da master of maae fet :aae am da captain of maae sol In this dark night covering me, which is black from side to side, i thank all the true gods, for my invincible soul
 Head soaked, but not bowed
 After this tearful and fury-filled place there is only a terrible darkness of death, but the period threatening me has found me fearless and will find fear
 The path of liberation, however hard it may be, Regardless of the punishments written in the end, only i am the master of my destiny: only i am the captain of my soul
 roc Raghunath Purushottam Paranjpe was an Indian mathematician
 cambridge vishvavidhyalay kaa cenier rangler banane vaale ve pratham bhartiya the
 Later he was also the Ambassador of India
 kapadaa, chamada, fer, bark yaa kisi anya lacheelee vastu ko aapas main sooyee evam dhaagon kii sahaayta baandhna silaai kehalaati he
 Domestic tailoring is mostly related to repairing, darning, clothing repairing and children's clothing
 iske liye uchit saadhan, uchit kapade or uchit tareeke kaa gyaan atyant aavashyak he
 Among the essential means of sewing, needlework is the first place
 suiyaan kai prakaar kii hoti hai, kuch moti, kuch baarik, inakon numberon dwaara vibhajit kiya gaya he
 The more number of needle there is, the more fine it will be
 mote kapade ke liye moti sooyee kaa prayog hota he or baarik kapade ke liye patali sooyee kaa
 There is a fear of breaking the needle from the chest by finely dipping the thick cloth, and with fine needle, fine cloth becomes thick holes in the cloth from the chest, which look very ugly
 adhiktar paanch number se aath number tak kii sooyee kaa prayog hota he
 The second place in the instrument is of thread
 dhaagaa kapade ke rang se miltaa hua hona chahie tathaa kapade ke hisaab se hi motaa yaa baarik bhi hona chahie
 By the way, 40 and 50 number threads are used for most of the stitching
 teesraa sthaan kanchi kaa he
 The scissors are neither too small nor big
 uski dhar tej honi chahie, jisase kapadaa safai se cat sake
 The fourth place is of inch tape, which is used for measuring cloth; Then marking colors or colored pencils are used
 sidhi linon ke liye yadi scale bhi paas ho to bahut acha hota he
 Most machines are now used for sewing
 isse silaai bahut sheeghra ho jaati he
 Stitching also requires fingers
 isse ungaliyon main sooyee nahin chubhane paati
 While sewing, it is very important to hold the cloth properly by hand and keep the needle in the right place
 silaai karte samay aap daahine haath se baayein haath kii ore chalate hai
 In contrast, the left hand is moved from left to right
 silaai kii turapan teen prakaar kii hoti he : dhaagaa bharna, turapan or bakhia karnaa
 It is very important to hold the clothes properly
 yadi kapadaa thik nahin pakadaa gaya to dhaagaa bharne main kaaphi samay lag jaataa he
 You hold the cloth in both hands, put a needle between the right hand thumb and the first finger, walk from right to left
 yah kapadon ko jodne ke kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 It is useful for the chest by turning the edge or stitch
 yah bhi do kapadon ko jodne ke kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 But this sharpness is stronger than filling thread
 iskaa udhedna atyant kathin hota he
 In this quickness, the first needle is inserted two places further by putting it in the previous hole and thus the buckle moves forward
 silaai ke uparokt teen prakaar hote hai
 In addition to these, various methods of attaching two pieces of cloth, duffing, hinge and button stitching are covered under domestic sewing
 got lagane ke liye kapade ko tirachha kaatna atyant aavashyak he
 There are two types of gota
 ek to do kapadon ke bich se baahar nikalati he
 The second one is on the edge of the fabric to make it beautiful
 pratham prakaar kii adhiktar razaaiyon ityadi main yahan jahaan doharaa kapadaa ho vahiin, lag sakati he
 The goat is folded and placed between two clothes
 duusare prakaar kii got lagane ke liye pehle kapade par got dhaagaa bharkar taak di jaati he
 It involves pulling the bow and loosening the cloth
 phir duusari ore modakar turapan kar di jaati he
 Different types of stitches are used to connect the two fabrics
 sidhi silaai - inamen do kapadon ko ek duusare par rakh kinare par 1 / 4 se 1 inch dur tak sidhaa dhaagaa bhar diya jaataa he, yaa bakhiya laga di jaati he
 Plain Stitch - In this, a cloth is filled with thread, after removing one cloth more and the other slightly less
 phir is silaai ko mode usapar turap diya jaataa he
 Double flat stitch - In this, like the picture, the edges of two clothes are placed on top of the other and the trumpet is made on both sides
 ulatakar silaai isamen do kapadon ko milakar bilkul kinare par dhaagaa bhar dete hai or phir unhen ulatakar ek or dhaagaa bhar dete hai
 Due to this, all of the clothes are swabbed inside the stitch and the stitch is very clean from the back side too
 rafu ke liye jahaan tak sambhav ho dhaagaa usee kapade main se nikaalnaa chahie tathaa kapade ke dhaagon ke rukh ke anusaar sooyee ko chalaanaa chahie, jaisaa chitra 9 main dikhaaya he
 In this way, a straight stitch is done in a straight, but if the cloth is torn diagonally, the cross is both straight and sewed
 jahaan par aapako paivand lagaana ho vahaan fate sthaan se bada ek anya chaukor kapadaa katkar usko fate sthaan par turapan se taak dijie
 After this, reverse the torn area by cutting it square and turning it to trump
 aavashyaktaa ke anusaar kaaj katkar, kaaj ke donon ore dhaagaa bharkar kaaj kii turapan se use chitra 11
 kii bhaanti jind dete hai
 Start the hinge from the other side of the button on which the button is thrust, and again there is the caste of stitching
 is prakaar yadi khadaa kaaj he to aarambh neeche kiya jaataa he, par pade kaaj ko kinare ke duusari ore se aarambh karte hai
 The button always has two or more holes
 un chhedon main se sooyee nikaalanakar batan ko kapade par si dete hai
 The two main stitches that sewing machines make of which the others are derivatives are lockstitch and chain stitch

 or james yuva catholic betaa he, james francis edward stuart, guzar rahaa taj ke bajaay ve ise apni kattar beti, mairi dwitiya, jo sanyukt rup se apane pati ke saath, jo england ke wiliam III ban jayega shashan hoga karne ke liye janaa chahie kaa faisla kiya
 In March 1689, a Scottish conference met in Edinburgh to decide the future of the Scottish crown
 raay kaaphi samaan rup se vibhajit the or thodi der ke liye yah ki james saatvin scots ke asli raja ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he sambhav tha
 However, the well-established Stuart trait of actually doing the wrong thing at the wrong time came up again, and when he wrote to the Scottish Conference was considered a conceited and threatening letter from William, a polite and reasoned letter With this James support was underestimated
 4 april, 1689 par scotland ke wiliam III or mairi dwitiya scotland kii sanyukt rajshahi ghoshit kiya gaya
 Although he was the son and heir of Victoria, Edward VII adopted his father's surname, and this led to the formation of a new royal family in Great Britain
 raja, rajya or chhatra kii shakti or samprabhutaa kaa dyotak or kisi apradhi ko uske aparaadh ke nimitt di gayi sajaa ko dand kehete hai
 In another context, one of the four measures of Political Science - Sama, Daam, Dand and Bhed
 dand kaa shabdic arth 'danda' he jisase kisi ko peeta jaataa he
 In the sacramental area, the punishment mainly being held by Brahmachari Vidyarthi can be mentioned
 grihyasutron, smritiyon, unki tikaaon, vrihatsamhita tathaa saadharantaya dharamshastra ke anya granthon main tatsambandhi vishad vivaran milte hai
 Accordingly, when Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas are Sanskrit from Upanayan rites through Yagyavidhi by Acharya in different stages, they are also required to bear benign and observant punishments
 shastragat vidhaan or paramparaagat manyataayen ye hai ki brahman balak keshantaparyant vilvadand, kshatriya balak lalaatparyant palashdand or vaishyabalak nasikaparyant udumbar kaa dand dhaaran karen 
 The term punishment is mainly used in relation to political science and administration
 jiske dwaara aparaadhiyon ko dandit kiya jaay vahi dand he, kintu iskaa prayog hota he rajya or shashan kii seemaa ke bheetar
 When it is used outside the state's border towards any enemy, friend, mediator or indifferent state, it becomes one of the four measures of politics and it means military experiment
 in baton ke vichaar se sambandh rakhanevaala shaastra hota he dandashastra or uski niti hoti he dandniti
 Punishment is the science of government and administration, the basis of which is to follow morality and law, which applies equally to both the punisher and the punisher
 uske bina lokyatra sambhav nahin
 
 kaamandak nitisar or mahabharat kii paribhaasha ke anusaar aparaadhon kaa daman hi dand athwa "niti" kehalaata he
 The person who performs this work means the symbol of this quality is called 'dandi', because of Nayan
 shankaracharya ne kaamandak kii tikaa karte hue manusmriti ko uddhrut kiya he, jahaan yah kaha gaya he ki sampurna lok dand ke bhay ke kaaran hi jagat kaa bhoga sambhav ho paata he
 Clearly, punishment had a great importance in Indian political science which was expressed in both real and symbolic forms
 dand ke bare main manusmriti main bahut baaten kahi gayi hai
 Manu says that the one who is punished is the king, he is the preacher of justice and the ruler of all, he is the surety of the religion of the four varnas and ashrams
 vahi raja va dand praja kaa shashankartta, sab praja kaa rakshak, sote hue prajasth manushyon main jaagta he, isi liye budhimaan log dand hi ko dharm kehete hai
 If the king wears the punishment properly, he makes all the subjects happy and if he is tried without thinking, he kills the king from all sides
 vina dand ke sab varna arthath praja dooshit or sab maryaada chhin-bhinn ho jaati he
 Due to non-compliance of the punishment, all the people can be wrath against the king and the state system
 yah bhi kaha he ki dand bada tejomay he jise avidvan va adharmatma dhaaran nahin kar saktaa
 Then in such a situation, he destroys only the king without punishment and his family
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki jo raja vidya, sushiksha se rahit, vishyon main aasakt va mudh he, vah nyaay se dand ko chalaane main samarth kabhi nahin ho saktaa
 Punishment originated with the origin of statehood
 manusmriti or mahabharat main yah kaha gaya he ki maanav jati kii praarambhik sthiti atyant pavitra swabhaav, dosharahit karm, satvaprakruti or ritu kii thi, jab na to kisi raja kii sthiti thi, na rajya tha, na dand tha, na dandi tha or sabhi log dharm ke dwaara hi ek duusare kii raksha karte the
 But over a period of time, the effect of tamasunas began to increase, human society became disenchanted with its primitive essence nature and fishery justice came into being
 balvan kamajoro ko khaane lage
 In such a situation, the kingdom and the king were born and a punishment was imposed to keep everyone on the right path
 dand rajya shakti kaa pratik hua jo sari prajaaon kaa shaasha, rakshak tathaa sabhi ke sote hue jaaganevaala tha
 Hence punishment was accepted as religion
 isse spasht prathit hota he ki dharm kaa sadhak keval dand hi mana gaya
 The religion which also contains meaning and work, that is, the seeker of Dandh Trivarga was accepted
 adarsh se skhalan ko dur karne ke liye dand kii aavashyaktaa hui
 Punishment as a state power began to circulate in the judicial arena
 uskaa uddeshy tha samaaj or dharm kii manyataon or yathasthiti kii raksha karnaa
 She was known as the status quo religion and there were many types of religion based on differences of caste, caste, ashram, country, time, group, class, family and occupation, etc
 used to have
 dand kaa prayog karanevaala raja bhi yadi dharm kaa ulanghan kare to dand kaa bhaagi hota tha
 There was no religion beyond religion, religion was also the king of kings
 rajya kaa pradhan raja athwa anya koi shakti, yatha ganatantr kaa mukhiya nyaayiky sanghathan kaa pradhan avashya tha, kintu vidhi kaa pradhan vah kabhi nahin ho sakaa or vidhi ke ulanghan karne par dand usapar bhi savaar ho jaataa tha
 This sovereignty of law and punishment in India appears to have developed from the Brahmanical period to the era of Manusmriti and Mahabharata
 aadhunik vidhishastri dand ke chaar siddhanth maanate hai -- The very early stage of society in all countries was symbolic punishment, in which the principle of tooth for eye and tooth for tooth was followed
 vaidic sahitya kii "jeevagrubh" jaisi sangyaayen is baat kii dyotak hen ki bhartiya itihaas ke atyant praarambhik kaal kaa nyaay kathor or pratikaratmak hi tha
 This theory holds that by punishing one criminal severely, other people are afraid of committing a crime
 nishedhaatmak siddhanth kii manyata he ki apradhi ko dand dene se jiske prati aparaadh hua he use uskaa 'badla' mil jaataa he
 This is the worst of all theories because it does not have the welfare of society or the sense of security of society
 teesri avasthaa main dand kaa swaroop pratikaratmak ke badale avarohak ho gaya
 The reason for this was to intervene in the kingdom holding the punishment instead of dealing with the guilty man
 vyaktigat badale kii bhaavana ko samaapt kar rajkeey dand kii mahima ko sthapit karnaa rajya kaa uddeshy or uski badhati hui shakti kaa dyotak ho gaya
 It was now impossible to get revenge in criminal cases, even though it was considered valid to get some revenge on a person convicted by imprisonment etc
 in civil cases
 kintu kathor - kabhi kabhi to atyant krur or asabhy dandon kaa diya janaa praayah niyam sa tha
 If we look at the punishments of the Upanishads, the punishments mentioned in the Buddhist scriptures, the recommendations of handcuffing by economics and its confirmations made by Megasthenes, or the punishments prevailing on both East and West up to the beginning of medieval and somewhat modern times
 If we think about it, we have to say that they were very cruel and barbaric in modern terms
 unka uddeshay tha auron main aparaadh karne ke prati bhay utpann karnaa
 These include mutilation, being burned alive, capital punishment, life imprisonment and punishments full of unbearable torture
 nirodhak dandon main aparaadh ke kaaran athwa uske bhavishya ke karta ko hi usase roak dene kaa upaay kiya jaataa he, jo uski vyaktigat swatantraaa chhinakar sampann hota he
 The Prevention of Jail Legislation of India is in this category
 chauthaa or sarvottam dand kaa prakaar he sudharatmak
 Even in the course of the development of civilization, although all countries have been subjected to severe obstructive punishments against potential culprits and to present fear of punishments, corrective tendencies have sometimes arisen
 pracheen rome main doshi kii swatantraaa kaa haran maatr hi sabase bada dand mana gaya or uske baad koi yatnaa aavashyak nahin samajhi gai 
 In India, Kautilya mentions the imprisonment to make atonement and to purify them by the system of making sense of their sins
 ashok ne bhi apane chaturth stambhalekh main vyavahaarasmta or dandsamta ke saath shuddhacharitra, dharmarat or sadvyavhaari doshiyon ke dandon ko kam karne kaa aadesh diya he
 These things are indicative of the corrective tendency of penal legislation
 smritiyon main dhigdand athwa vagdand kii charchaayen aati hai, jo sarvada kaaydand or vadhadand se pehle aata tha
 It meant that if the work goes on with just social condemnation, then what is the need of harsh torture? One rule was acceptable and that the punishment should be "as it is" and it should be given only when there is an offense
 20veen shatee main dandvidhaan ko sudharatmak swaroop dene ke praytn ho rahe hai
 In 1872, a meeting was held in London to decide an international form of international prison reform and punishment
 baad main tatsambandhi samuhik sanghatan bhi sthapit hue par uske sadsy adhikanshat: europea desh hi rahe
 Gradually, instead of harsh punishments, the moral life of the imprisoned convict was revived

 Despite the "base effect" in general, recent findings have shown that during schizophrenia in many individuals, high emotional responses, especially strained or negative senses, and susceptibility to such a pathology also cause a similar prevalence of symptoms
 kuch udhaaharan yah sujhaate hai ki aspasht vishwaas kii vishaywastu or manovikruti kaa anubhav bhaawanaaon ke kaaran vikaar ke rup main pradarshit ho saktaa he or ek vyakti apane anubhavon ko kis prakaar vyakhya karata he iske lakshanon ko prabhavikat karata he

 Studies by neurological psychological tests and brain modeling techniques such as fmri and PET to test for functional differences in brain function have shown that differences are mostly found in the frontal / anterior part of the brain, hippocampus, and temporal parts
 in bhinnataaon ko tantrikeey sangyanatmak durbalataaon se jod diya gaya he jinhen aksar paagalpan / manorog samaj liya jaataa he
 Specific attention has been focused on the functioning of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain
 aisa karne kii ek badi vajah aakasmik adhyayanon ke parinaamon yah pataa chalanaa he ki dawaaon kaa ek samooh, jo dopamine kii karypranali ko avaruddh kar detaa he or jinhen phinotheagins ke naam se janaa jaataa he, isse manorog ke lakshanon main kami aa sakati he
 This concept also confirms the fact that amphetamines, which increase the secretion of dopamine, can worsen psychiatric symptoms in the event of schizophrenia
 ek prabhavali avadharana, jise sizophrenia kaa dopamine sidghant bhi kehete hai, ke anusaar D2 abhigrahakon kaa atyadhik sakriy hona sizophrenia kaa kaaran hota he
 Although common among all psychiatric resistance effects, D2 inhibition was thought to be the same for 20 years until PET and SPET impersonation studies in the mid-1990s provided convincing evidence
 is vyakhya ko ab atyant saamaanya samajha jaataa he, kyonki ek to nae manorog pratirodhi ilaaj bhi utane hi prabhavi hai jitne ki puraane ilaaj, lekin yah serotonin kii karypranali ko bhi prabhavit karata he or sambhawatah isamen dopamine avarodhi prabhaav thodaa kam ho saktaa he
 Simultaneously, the decreased effects of neurotransmitter glutamate and NMDA glutamate receptors in schizophrenia have also been noted
 is avadharana ko un logon ke maranoparant mastishk pareekshan main paae gaye asaamaanya rup se kam glutamet abhigrahakon ke str se bhi samarthan miltaa he, jinka pehle sizophrenia ke liye ilaaj kiya gaya tha 199, or saath hi yah khoj ki glutamet avarodhi davaaiyaan jaise phincyclidine or ketamine in paristhitiyon se jude lakshno or sangyanatmak samasyaon kaa anukaran kar sakati he
 The fact that glutamate receptors are less effective means that the tests to detect the function of the frontal / forebrain and hippocampal are not accurate, and that glutamate affects the functioning of dopamine, all of these in schizophrenia
 , Which has been shown to be an important mediator in the role of glutamate pathways in schizophrenia

 However, according to these studies, the average change in volume is close to the measurement range set by MRI methods, so it is naïve to determine that schizophrenia is a neurological process that is weighty when symptoms appear
 Or that it is better to consider it a process of neurological development in which an abnormal amount of brain is produced at an early age

 The author states that in schizophrenia two networks of the white matter tract may be affected, which is likely to 'break down' the gray matter regions to which they are attached

 The correlation between more opposing two networks reveals excessive rivalry between networks

 ek internet protocol adress ek sankhyatmak label he jo apane nodes ke bich sanchaar ke liye internet protocol kaa prayog karanevaale computer network main bhaag le rahe divices ko abantit kiya jaataa he
 An IP address performs two major functions: host or network interface identification and location detection
 The characterization of its role is as follows: “A name indicates what we ask for
 ek pataa ingit karata he ki vah kahan he
 a route indicates how to get there
 " TCP / IP ke diziner ne IP adress ko ek 32-bit nambar ke rup main paribhaashit kiya or internet protocal varjan 4 yaa ipv4 ke naam se jaani janevaali yah pranali, aaj bhi upyog main he
 However, due to the extensive development of the Internet and consequently the lack of available addresses, a new detection system using 128 bits for addresses was developed in 1995 and last standardized by RFC 2460 in 1998
 haalanki IP adress dwiadhari sankhya ke rup main jamaa kiye jate he, vah aamtaur par maanviya-pathyogy chihnkaree jaise 208

166 or 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:1:1 main pradarshit kiye jate hai
 The Internet protocol also sends data packets between networks; The IP address specifies the location of the source and destination nodes in the topology of the routing system
 is prayojan ke liye, ek IP adress ke kuch bits ek sab-network abhinihit karne ke liye istemaal kiye jate hai
 The number of these bits is indicated in CIDR notation, appended to the IP address, such as 208

 jaise hi nijee network ke vikaas ne ipv4 adress ke samaapan ke khatre ko uthaaya, RFC 1918 ne nijee adress sthaan kaa ek samooh nirdhaarit kiya jo nijee network par kisi ke bhi dwaara istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 They are often used with network address translators to connect to the global public Internet
 da internet asind number athurity, jo saarvbhaumik IP adress sthaan niyatan prabandh karata he, sthaneey internet registry or anya sansthaaon ko IP khand aabantan karne ke liye, paanch kshetreey internet registry ko sahyog detaa he
 Two versions of the Internet protocol are in use: IP version 4 and IP version 6
 See version history
) Each version defines an IP address differently
 uski vyapaktaa ke kaaran, saamaanya shabd ypi adress aam taur par ab bhi ipv4 dwaara paribhaashit adress ko sanderbhit karata he
 ipv4 uses a 32-bit address, which limits the address space to 4,294,967,296) possible unique addresses
 ipv4 kuch adress, vishesh prayojanon jaise nijee network yaa bahustrpiya adress ke liye arakshit karata he
 This reduces the number of addresses to be assigned to end-users and as the number of available addresses decays, ipv4 address completion becomes fixed
 yah purvaabhaasi kami ipv6 viksit karne ke liye praathmik prerana thi, jo duniya bhar main vibhinn tainaati charnon main he or ipv4 pratisthaapan or internet ke lagaataar vistaar ke liye akeli ranneeti he
 ipv4 addresses are usually represented in dot-decimal notation
 prayek bhaag adress ke 8 bit kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or isliye ocotate kahalaaya jaataa he
 In less common cases of technical writing, ipv4 addresses can be presented in hexadecimal, octal, or binary representations
 sarvaadhik pratinidhitiv main prayek ocotate vyaktigat rup se badla jaataa he
 In the initial phase of Internet Protocol development, network administrators described the IP address in two parts, the network number portion and the host number portion
 The highest order octet in an address was designated a network number, and the remaining bits were called rest fields or host identifiers and were used for internal host numbering of the network
 yah paddati jald hi annuroop sabit hui jaise hi atirikt network viksit hue jo maujuuda network se svachhand the, jinhen pehle se hi ek network sankhya dwaara abhinihit kiya hota tha
 In 1981, the Internet addressing specification was revised with the inclusion of a classful network structure
 classphul network dizine ek badi sankhya ke liye vyaktigat network kaary kii anumati detaa tha
 The first three bits of the most important octet of an IP address were defined as a range of addresses
 saarvbhaumik unicast parichayan ke liye teen shreneeyaan paribhaashit kii gai
 Network identification based on derived class was based on octet boundary areas of the entire address
 prayek shrenee network pahachanakarta main kramshah atirikt octate kaa upyog karti thi, is prakaar se ucch varg shrenee main sambhav mejabaanon kii sankhya kam ho jaati he
 The following table gives an overview of the system thus obsolete
 'sabanetwork' or 'classphul network' lekh main is abhikalp kaa vivaran samajhaayaa gaya he
 Although the classful network design was a successful developmental stage, wild Internet expansion made it difficult to move forward and when classless inter-domain routing was created to provide new IP address segments and use ipv4 addresses for routing protocols
 When new rules were prepared for, it was dropped
 swecchit-lambaai upsargon kaa aabantan evam anumaargan karwaane ke liye siidiar veriable-lenth sabanet masking par aadhaarit he
 Today, the residuals of the classful network concept operate only in a limited area, which is the default configuration parameter of some network software and hardware components and is used in technical discussions of network administrators
 aarambhik network abhikalp main jab sanchaar ke liye sabhi internet prayogkartaaon ke bich vaishvik str par ek chaur se duusare chaur tak jodne kii baat sochi gai to yah lakshya tha ki prayek computer yaa upkaran kaa ek vishisht ypi pataa ho
 But it was found that it is not always possible to do so as private networks developed and public addresses needed to be conserved
 jo computer internet se nahin jude hai, jaise ki kaarkaane kii mashine jo tisipi / ypi ke madhyam se keval aapas main sanchaar karti hai, unke liye vaishvik taur par vishisht ypi pataa hona jaruri nahin he
 For private networks three of the ipv4 addresses, one limit for each class, were reserved in the 1918 RFC
 in paton kaa margan internet par nahin kiya jaataa or isliye inkaa prayog ypi paton kii panji ke saath samanvit karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Today, when needed, such private networks usually connect to the Internet through network address translation
 koi bhi upyogkarta kisi bhi arakshit blaak kaa upyog kar sakate hai
 Typically, a network administrator splits a segment into subnets, for example, many home enrollers automatically use a left address range of 192

 ypi sanskaran 4 pate kaa sthaan teji se apane aadhikarik taur par uplabdh abantit pate ke khandon ke samaapan par pahunch rahaa he
 Despite the preservation techniques, the rapid completion of the ipv4 address space prompted the Internet Engineering Task Force to explore new technologies to expand the Internet's addressing capabilities
 iskaa sthaayee samaadhaan, internet protocol kaa hi ek nayaa swaroop, samajha tha
 This next generation of Internet Protocol, intended to replace ipv4 on the Internet, was eventually renamed Internet Protocol version 6 in 1995
 pataa aakaar 32 se badha kar 128 bit yaa 16 ocotate kar diya gaya, jo, network block ke ek udaar kaam ke saath bhi, nikat bhavishya ke liye paryaapt mana jaataa he
 Mathematically, the new address space provides a capacity of up to 2, or approximately 3
403 × 10 unique addresses
 nayaa dizin keval adress kii paryaapt maatra pradaan karne ke lakshya par aadhaar nahin he, balki sabanet anumaargan upsargon ke kushal ekatrikaran ko anumaargan nodes par hone kii anumati dene ke liye
 As a result, the routing table size is small and the smallest possible individual allocation is a subnet for 264 hosts, which is square of the size of the entire ipv4 Internet
 in staron par, vaastavik adress upyog dar kisi bhi ipv6 network khand par chota hoga
 The new design also provides the opportunity to isolate the addressing infrastructure of a network segment — which is the local administration of the segment's available space — from an addressing prefix used to route external traffic to a network
 ipv6 main aisi suvidhaayen he jo, yadi vaishvik sampark yaa anumaargan niti main parivartan ho, to bina aantarik nae swaroop yaa nae sankhyankan ke swatah hi puure network kaa anumaargan upsarg badal detii hai
 The large number of ipv6 addresses allows large blocks to be specified for specific purposes and, where appropriate, to be aggregated for efficient routing
 ek bade adress sthaan ke saath ek jatil pataa sangrakshan takanic kii jarurat nahin hoti, jaise clasles inter-domen rooting main upyog kii jaati he
 According to Submodern, desktop and enterprise server operating systems include seamless support for the ipv6 protocol, but are not yet widely deployed in other devices such as home networking routers, voice over internet protocols, and multimedia devices and network peripherals
 ek ipv6 pate kaa udhaaharan: As ipv4 reserves addresses for private or internal networks, ipv6 has separate sets of addresses for private addresses
 ipv6 main, in ko unic local adress ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 RFC 4,193 sets the routing prefix fc00 :: / 7 separately for this department, which is divided into two / 8 departments with different available policies
 The address includes a 40-bit pseudorandom number of site mergers or packets
 Addresses on the wrong route reduce the risk of encounter
 aarambhik dizin is prayojan ke liye ek alag khand kaa prayog karte the, dabd site-sthaneey adress
 haalanki, site kaa gathan kis se hota he, isaki paribhaasha aspasht rahi or kharaab paribhaashit parichayan niti ne anumaargan main sandigdhta bana di
 The address range specification has been abandoned and should no longer be used in the new system
 fe80 se shuru hote pate: - link-local adress kahalaaye jane vaale - keval sthaneey link kshetra main niyat kiye jate hai
 Addresses are usually generated automatically by the IP layer of the operating system for each network interface
 yah kisi bhi ipv6 mejabaan ke liye tatkaal swat: network sanyojaktaa pradaan karata he or iskaa matlab he ki yadi kai mejabaan ek aam hub yaa switch se judate hai to unke link sthaneey ipv6 adress dwaara unhen ek sheeghra sanchaar maarg miltaa he
 This feature is used extensively and indirectly for most users in the lower layers of ipv6 network administration
 saarvajanik internet main koi bhi nijee adress upsarg nahin bheja ja saktaa
 The technique of subnetting can work in both ipv4 and ipv6 networks
 ypi adress do bhaagon main vibhajit he: network adress or host idantifire 
 sabanet mask yaa CIDR upsarg nirdhaarit karata he ki kaise IP adress network or host bhaagon main vibhajit he
 The term subnet mask is only used in ipv4
 halanki donon ypi sanskaran, classles inter-domen rooting kii avadharana or sanketan kaa upyog karte hai
 In this, there is a slash behind the IP address and the number of bits used for the network part, also called the route prefix
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek ipv4 adress or uskaa sabanet mask kramshah 192

 The CIDR notation for the same IP address and subnet mask is 192

 jab ek computer har baar ek hi ai pi adress kaa prayog karne ke liye samanurup kiya jaataa he to vah tej ho jaataa he, ise static IP adress kehete hai
 Conversely, in cases when the computer's IP address is assigned automatically, it is known as a dynamic IP address
 static IP adress ek vyavasthaapak dwaara haath se computer ko saunpa he
 Its exact process varies by platform
 yah dinemic ai pi adress se asaadrishy hai, jo yaa to computer interphes yaa swayam host software, jaise xeronkonf main, dwaara nirdisht hote he yaa dinemic host kanfigreshna protocol ke istemaal se ek sarwar dwaara nirdisht kiye hote he
 Although IP addresses specified using DHCP remain the same for long periods of time, they can usually change
 kuch maamalon main, ek network vyavasthaapak sakriy rup se nirdisht static IP adress lagu kar saktaa hai
 In this case, a DHCP server is used, but it is specifically tailored to always assign the same IP address to a specific computer
 yah static IP adress ko mukhya rup se samanurup hone kii anumati detaa he, jisamen network par prayek computer ko hastchalit pranali dwaara vishesh rup se samanurup karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati
 In the absence or failure of a static or stateful address configuration, an operational system can assign an IP address to a network interface using state-less automatic-configuration techniques, such as Xeroconf
 gatisheel ypi pate dinemic host kanfigareshan protocol sarvaron dwaara atyadhik praayah lans or broadband network par niyukt hote hai
 They are used because they can avoid the administrative burden of assigning specific static addresses for each device on a network
 yah kai upkarnon ko ek network par simit adress sthaan main sahabhaagi banane kii anumati bhi detaa he, par keval yadi un main se kuch kisi vishesh samay par online hon
 kai vartmaan desktop oparating system main, gatisheel ypi vinyas difolt rup se sakasham kiya hota he taaki ek upyogkarta ko DHCP sarwar ke saath ek network se judane ke liye apane haath se koi settings darj karne kii aavashyaktaa naa pade
 gatisheel IP adress nirdisht karne ke liye DHCP hi akeli takanic nahin he
 Dialup and some broadband networks use dynamic address characteristics of point-to-point protocols
 ek stick dinemic IP adress yaa stick ypi cabel or DSL internet adhigam bhugtankarta dwaara ek gatyaatmakataa se niyukt ypi adress jisamen aksar badlaav nahin aata, uskaa varnan karne ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Addresses are usually assigned with the DHCP protocol
 chunki modem aamtaur par vistaarit avadhi ke samay ke liye yantrachaalit hote hai, isliye adress patte aksar lambey samay ke liye niyamit kiye jate hai or samaapti hone par naveekrut kar die jate hai
 If a modem is turned off and the address is re-operated before the next termination of the lease, it is most likely that it will receive the same IP address
 RFC 3330 ipv4 networkon ke liye sthaneey-link adressing main vishesh upyog karne ke liye adress block, 169

0
0 / 16, paribhaashit karata he
 In ipv6, each interface using static or dynamic address functions automatically receives a local-link address in the fe80 :: / 10 subnet
 ye adress keval link par vaid hote hai, jaise ek sthaneey network khand yaa binduvaar conection jisase koi host judaa hua ho
 These addresses are not routable and cannot be the source or destination of Internet packet blocking like private addresses
 jab sthaneey-link ipv4 adress block arakshit hua tha, adress swachaalit-samakriti ke tantra ke liye koi bhi maanak astitv main nahin tha
 Filling the void, Microsoft created an implementation called automatic private IP addressing
 microsoft kii vipanan kshamta ke kaaran APIPA ko lakhon mashiinon par tainaat kiya gaya he or, is prakaar yah udyog main ek vaastavik maanak ban gaya he
 Many years later, the IETF defined a formal standard for this functionality, RFC 3927, as the official configuration of the local-link address ipv4
 kuch buniyadi dhaanchon ko sthitik adress upyog karnaa aavashyak he, jaise ki domen naam pranali kaa host praapt karne par jo domen naam ko IP adress main badal detaa he
 Static address is also convenient to set up a server in an enterprise, but not at all necessary
 DNS sarwar se praapt kiya gaya ek adress apane jeevankaal, yaa kaishing samay ke saath aata he, jiske baad isamen badlaav nahin aayaa, isaki pushti karne ke liye yah dekha janaa chahie
 Even static IP addresses change as a result of network management
 today ke anusaar internet par fyrwal aam hai
 For increased network security, they control access to private networks based on the customer's public IP
 kaali suchi prayog kar rahe ho yaa safed suchi, jo IP adress avaruddh hota he, vah graahak kaa kathith saarvajanik ypi adress hota he, matlab yadi graahak proxi sarwar yaa NAT istemaal kar rahaa ho to ek IP adress kaa avrodh karne se kai alag alag log avaruddh ho sakate hai
 Multiple client tools can be displayed to use an IP address: either because it is part of a shared hosting web server environment or because an ipv4 network address translator or proxy server acts as an intermediary on behalf of its clients In this case, the actual IP address generated may be hidden from the server receiving the request
 ek nijee network main NAT kaa ek badi sankhya main IP adress ko chhipaana ek aam kaary pranali he
 Only "external" interfaces of NAT require an Internet routable address
 sabase saamaanya net upkaran bahari ore TCP yaa UDP port sankhya maanchitr karte hai or bhitari bhaag main vyaktigat nijee adress ko
 Just as a telephone number may have a site-specific extension, port numbers are a site-specific extension for an IP address
 chote gharelu network main, NAT kaary aam taur par ek awasaiya pravesh-dwaar divaais main hote hai, vishisht rup se ek "router" ke rup main bechaa jaataa he
 In this scenario, the computer connected to the router will have a 'private' IP address and the router will have a government address to communicate with the Internet
 is prakaar kaa router, kai computer ko ek saarvajanik ai pi pataa baantne kii anumati detaa he
 In Windows the IP address can be determined using the command line tool ipconfig

 Tirthankar Parshwanath was born in Varanasi about 3 thousand years ago
 varanasi main ashwasen naam ke ikshvakuvansheey raja the
 His queen Vama gave birth to a great son on the day of Pausha Krishna Ekadashi with a serpent on his body
 vama devi ne garbhakaal main ek baar swapn main ek sarp dekha tha, isliye putr kaa naam 'parshv' rakhaa gaya
 His early life was spent as a prince
 ek din parshv ne apane mahal se dekha ki puravasi puja kii saamagree liye ek ore ja rahe hai

 Sarnath is famous as Jainpur in jain-agam texts
 yaheen par jain dharm ke 11wein tirthankar shreyansnath ji ne janm liya tha or apane ahimsa dharm kaa prachaar-prasar kiya tha
 Only after knowledge, Tirthankara Parshvanath taught the five main vows of Jainism - truth, non-violence, astheya, aparigraha and celibacy
 ant main apana nirvanakaal sameep jaanakar shri sammed shikharji par chale gaye jahaan shravan shukla ashtami ko unhe moksh kii prapti hui
 The biggest proof of the popularity of Lord Parshwanath is that even today, the symbol of Parshvanath is the highest among all the Tirthankara statues and icons
 aaj bhi parswanath kii kai chamatkaarik murtiyan desh bhar main virajit he
 Whose saga is still told by old people
 aisa mana jaataa he ki mahatma buddha ke adhikansh purvaj bhi parswanath dharm ke anuyaayi the

 ganit or computer vigyaan main, hexadesimal ek sthetiya ank pranali he jiske ek mulank yaa aadharank kaa maan 16 hota he
 It uses sixteen different symbols in which symbols 0 to 9 represent values from zero to nine and symbols A, B, C, D, E, f display values from ten to fifteen
 We do
 udhaaharan ke liye, hexadesimal sankhya 2AF3 kaa maan dashamik sankhya pranali main + + + yaa 10,995 ke baraabar hota he
 Each hexadecimal digit, also called four binary digits) is represented, and hexadecimal notation is used in computing and digital electronics as a human-friendly representation of binary coded values
 udhaaharan ke liye, bit ke maan 0 se 255 tak ho saktaa he lekin iske maanon ko or suvidhajanak bhang se 00 se lekar FF tak vaale do hexadesimal akon ke rup main pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Hexadecimal is also commonly used to represent computer memory addresses
 saanchaa:hexadecimal tablejina paristhitiyon main reference kaa abhaav hota he, un paristhitiyon main anya mul ankon main vyakt kii gai sankhyaon ke saath ek hexadesimal sankhya aspasht or bhraamak ho sakati he
 There are many ways of expressing values clearly
 ek sankhyatmak sabscript mul ank ko spasht rup se vyakt kar saktaa he: 15910, dashamal 159 he; 15916 hexadesimal 159 he, jiskaa maan 34510 ke baraabar hota he
 Other authors prefer to use a text subscript, such as 159 decimal and 159 hex, or 159d and 159h
 rekhiy paath pranalion, jaise - adhikansh computer programing pariveshon main istemaal kii jaani vaali pranaaliyon, main vibhinn prakaar ke tareekon kaa aagaman hua he: # x and # 16r are used as prefixes

 In the early history of computers, the choice of letters from a to f to display digits above nine was not universal
 1950 ke dashak ke dauraan, 10 se 15 tak ke maanon ko suchit karne ke liye ek macrone kairactor ke saath 0 se lekar 5 tak ke ankon kaa istemaal karne par kuch pratishthapan kaary anukool sabit hue
 bendix ji-15 computer upyogkarta u se lekar z tak ke aksharon kaa upyog karte the
 Bruce A
 of Brookhaven National Laboratory Martin considered the option of using a to f to be "ridiculous" and in a letter to the CACM editor in 1968, he proposed the use of a whole new set of symbols based on bit locations that were not accepted enough
 
 das se pandrah tak kii matraaon ko pradarshit karne ke liye koi paaramparik ank uplabdh nahin he—inaki jagah aksharon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he—or adhikansh pashchimi europea bhashaaon main das se upar ke ankon ke liye gaiyr-dashamalav naamon kaa abhaav he
 In spite of the many non-decimal powers in English and the accessibility of names for Great Gross, no English name describes hexadecimal powers
 kuch log hexadesimal sankhyaon ke ek-ek ank ko ek phone number kii tarah padhate hai: 4DA ko "four-di-e" padhate hai
 However, a sounds like the letter "at", c sounds like "three", and d can easily sound like the "-ty" suffix: is it 4D or forty? Others avoid getting confused by using the NATO phonetic alphabet: 4DA is "four-delta-alpha"; Or Joint Army / Navy Phonetic Alphabet; Or a similar ad hoc system
 binary or hexadesimal donon ke liye ankon kii ginati karne kii pranaaliyon kii yojana banaai gai he
 Arthur C
 Clarke suggested using each finger as an on / off bit, facilitating the use of the finger to count from zero to 1023 on ten fingers
 FF tak kii ginati karne ke liye istemaal hone vaali ek anya pranali ko daayin taraf darshaya gaya he; yah baarah ke gunankon main ginati karne ek maujuuda pranali kaa ek vistrut rup lagata he jiskaa istemaal aam taur par dakshin asia or anya jagahon main kiya jaataa he
 In the hexadecimal system negative numbers can be expressed in the same way as the decimal system: –2A to represent –42 and so on
 haalanki, iske bajaay kuch log procesar main istemaal kiye jane vaale sateek bit pattern ko vyakt karnaa pasand karte hai or hexadesimal maanon ko sanketit maanon ke rup main hi sabase acchhee tarah sanbhale jane kaa vichaar rakhte hai
 In this way, the negative number -42 can be written as xxrep 4 f FFD6 in a 32-bit CPU register as C228 xxrep 4 0 in a 32-bit FPU register, or C045 xxrep 4 0 xxrep 4 0 in a 64-bit FPU register
 Can be written as xxrep 4 0 
 adhikansh computer binary data main pher-badal karte hai, lekin ek apekshaakrit choti binary sankhya ke liye bhi anginat ankon ke saath kaam karnaa insaanon ke liye mushkil he
 Although most humans are familiar with the base 10 system, it is quite easy to map a binary in hexadecimal compared to a decimal
 is udhaaharan xxrep 4 1 2 ko aadharank das main roopantarit kar detaa he
 Since each space of a binary number can have either 1 or 0, its value can be easily determined by its position from the right: isliye: With surprisingly little practice, it becomes easy to map xxrep 4 1 2 to F16 in one step: see table of performance of hexadecimal
 The benefit of using hexadecimal instead of decimal leads to a rapid increase in the size of the number
 jab sankhya bahut badi ho jaati he, to ise dashamalav main roopantarit karnaa bahut kathin ho jaataa he
 However, when mapping hexadecimal, it becomes negligible to recognize binary strings as 4-digit groups and map each to a single hexadecimal digit
 yah udhaaharan dashamalav main ek binary sankhya ke roopantaran ko dikhaata he, prayek ank ko dashamalav maan main map karata he or parinaamon ko jodta he
 Compare this to the conversion done in hexadecimal, where each four-digit group can be freely considered and directly converted: hexadesimal se binary main kiya jane vaala roopantaran bhi utana hi pratyaksh hota he
 The octal system can also be used as an instrument for people directly encountering binary computer data
 octal data ko chaar ke bajaay teen bits prati kairactor ke rup main darshata he
 As with all bases, the source base has a simple algorithm for modifying the display of a number in hexadecimal by dividing it into integers and performing the remaining operations
 saidhantik rup se yah kisi bhi aadharank se sambhav he lekin adhikansh insaanon ke liye keval dashamalav or adhikansh computaron ke liye keval binary ko is tareeke se badi aasaani se sambhala ja saktaa he
 Let us assume b to be the number displayed in hexadecimal and hihi-1
 

h2h1 shrinkhalaa ko is sankhya ko pradarshit karne vaale hexadesimal ank maan lete hai
 "16" can be replaced with any other base that may be desirable
 nimnlikhit, string pradarshan main kisi bhi sankhya ko ek hexadesimal main roopantarit karne ke liye uparokt elgorithm kaa ek javascript karyanvayan he
 Its purpose is to describe the above algorithm
 tathaapi, data ke saath gambhirthapurvak kaam karne ke liye kaaphi had tak bitwiz operataron ke saath kaam karne kii salaah di ja sakati he
 The conversion function can also be performed by providing a hexadecimal display of each place value in the source base and then adding and multiplying it to get the final performance
 arthath B3AD sankhya ko dashamalav sankhya main roopantarit karne ke liye koi bhi is roopantaran ko D, A, 3 or b main vibhajit kar saktaa he or uske baad prayek dashamalav pradarshan ko 16p se guna karke antim parinaam praapt kar saktaa he, jahaan 'p' daaen se baayen anukool sthiti he jo 0 se shuru hota he
 In this case we get 13 * + 10 * + 3 * + 11 * which is equal to 45997 in the decimal system
 graphical yujar interphes vaali sabase aadhunik computer pranaliyaan ek antarnirmit calculator utility pradaan karti hai jisamen vibhinn mulaankon ke bich roopantaran karne kii kshamta hoti he jisamen aam taur par hexadesimal bhi shaamil hota he
 In Microsoft Windows, the calculator utility can be set to scientific calculator mode, which allows conversion between radix 16, 10, 8 and 2; Basis most commonly used by programmers
 In scientific mode, the on-screen numeric keypad contains hexadecimal digits from a to f that become active when "hex" is selected
 hex mod main, tathaapi, windos calculator keval purnankon kaa samarthan karata he
 As with other numerical systems, the hexadecimal system can be used to represent rational numbers, although recurring digits are common because sixteen has only a single prime factor: jahaan ek overline ek aavarti paddati ko suchit karata he
 For any base, 0
1 is always equal to that divided by the performance of that base value in its own number system: the count of base 3 is 0, 1, 2, 10
