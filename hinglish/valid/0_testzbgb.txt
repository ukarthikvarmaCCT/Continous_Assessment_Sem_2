 The functioning of transformers, electric generators etc
 is based on this principle
 is niyam ke anusaar, The theory of electromagnetic induction was discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831, and Joseph Henry also discovered this principle independently in the same year

 Faraday gave this rule orally and it was about the 'number of magnetic flux lines' that he developed
 isi kaaran academik jagat main uski sankalpana kaa prasar nahin ho paaya
 In 1845, Neuman wrote this rule in mathematical terms - jahaan φ b { \ displaystyle \ Phi _{B}}, chumbakeey flux he jise nimnlikhit dhang se paribhaashit kiya jaataa he- Here the floor s { \ displaystyle S} is any floor on which the above closed circuit is located
 vibhavaantar kii paribhaasha kaa upyog karte hue, nimnlikhit sameekaran likh sakate hai- Where e is the electric field at a point in the circuit

 prayek yuddh main jo rajya ek duusare ke viruddh yuddh karte hai, ve "yuddhrat" rajya kahe jate hai
 States which do not fight from any side or do not participate in war are called neutral states
 at: tatasthta vah nippaksh athwa tatasth rahane kaa bhav he, jo yuddh main sammilit na honevaale tisare rajya yuddhrat donon paksh ke rajyon ke prati dhaaran karte hai or yuddhrat rajya is bhav ko apni manyata pradaan karte hai
 This sense of fairness or neutrality creates certain duties and certain rights between neutral states and warring states
 pracheen yug main tatasthta kaa prachlan nahin tha
 If a war broke out in those days, then the third states other than the two warring states had to choose which of these two sides to join
 ve ek ke mitra ban jate the or duusare ke shuthru
 In the medieval era, any state could declare that it could support either of the two warring parties
 17veen shatabdi main antarrashtriya vidhaan main tatasthta ko ek sanstha rup main sthaan praapt hua, yadhyapi us samay vah apni shaishvavastha main hi thi or apana vartmaan swaroop praapt kaane ke liye use dirdh kaal kii asavashyaktaa thi
 It was only in the 18th century that it became valid in both theoretical and practical terms that neutral states have a duty to be neutral or impartial and that warring states have a duty to respect the jurisdiction of neutral states
 san 1914 main pratham vishwayuddh prarambh hua
 At that time, many states announced that they would remain neutral
 is prakaar kii ghoshnaa karanevaale rajyon main sanyukt rajya america bhi tha
 But in October 1916, America also joined the war
 yuddh kaa ant hone par rashtrasang ke anubandhan ne tatasthta ke paramparaagat niyam kii samaapti kar di
 According to Section 10 of the said contract, the members of the League of Nations agreed to respect the territorial or territorial integrity and political independence of all member states
 sitambar, 1939 main dwitiya vishwayuddh chhidane par tatasthta kaa paranmparaagat niyam asthaayee rup se punarujjivit hua
 The United States and many other countries again announced that they would remain neutral in this war
 germany ne inamen se adhikansh rajyon kii tatasthta kaa ulanghan kiya
 Even during its neutrality, the United States made a borrower law to help the Allied Powers on the pretext that the security of these countries is necessary for the security of America itself
 yah prashn vivadagrast rahaa he ki jin dinon america probidhik rup main tatasth tha, un dino uskaa aisa aacharan kya uchit tha? After the end of the Second World War, when the United Nations Charter was approved in 1945, it abolished neutrality in a legal form
 us adhikaarptr main aise rajyon ke pruthak vaidhanik astitv kii koi vyavastha nahin he
 According to him, no state can remain voluntarily neutral in a war in respect of which the Security Council has found a particular state guilty of breach of peace or aggression and for which the United Nations has called upon its member nations to Take military action against the said state
 shaashvat tatasthta - shaashvat athwa chirsthayee tatasthta un rajyon kii tatasthta he, jo vishesh sandhiyon dwaara sweekaar kar lete he jaise, switzraland kii tatasthta
 Voluntary and Conventional Neutrality - If a state remains voluntarily neutral and does not make itself neutral by a treaty, its neutrality is voluntary neutrality
 duusari ore, yadi koi rajya aisi sandhi karata he ki yuddh chhidane par vah tatasth rahegaa, to uski tatasthta paramparaagat athwa vyavaharsiddh tatasthta kahi jaaygi
 Armed neutrality - If a warring state tries to use the jurisdiction of a neutral and that neutral state takes military action to protect its neutrality then military action to protect such neutrality, then such neutrality "armed neutrality" Will go somewhere dwitiya vishwayuddh ke samay belgium, holland or switzraland kii tatasthta aisi hi sashastr tatasthta bhi
 Because, at that time these states kept presenting their armies for war
 sampurna or sampratibandh tatasthta- us rajya kii tatasthta "sapratibandh tatasthta" maani jaaygi, jo yon to tatasth rahata he, par pratyaksh athwa apratyaksh rup se do main se kisi ek yuddhrat paksh ko kisi prakaar kii sahaayta pradaan karata he
 On the other hand, neutrality of states that do not provide any kind of assistance to any warring state would be considered "total neutrality"
 1
 yuddhrat rajyon ke prati nishpakshta kaa bhav rakhana
 2
 To give its consent if a warring state exercises its right to punish them for violating the rules relating to blockade and movement of contraband goods by traders of neutral state
 1
 tatast rajyon ke nishpakshta sambandhi bhav ke anukool unke prati vyavhaar karnaa
 2 Not to suppress the trade-commerce or other relations of neutral states with respect to the enemy state
 yadi koi yuddhrat rajya kisi tatasth rajya kii tatasthta bhang karne kaa praytn karen, to vah tatasth rajya sadaiv hi apni raksha ke liye shastr uthaa saktaa he or uskaa yah balaprayog shatruta kaa kaary nahin mana jayega
 No neutral state should allow any warring state to take out its army, munitions or other logistics etc
 from within its territory
 parantu vah apane samudratati kshetra se yuddhrat rajyon ke yupoton ko vahaan se hokar nikal jane de saktaa he
 These warships can be allowed to pass through there
 in yupoton ko apane bandargahon se bahishkrut karne kii use aavashyaktaa nahin
 But in this way, the warships of the warring state should not do any such enemy act while going through the neutral states, which will cause harm to the warships of the enemy state
 yuddhrat rajyon ko tatasth rajyon ke samudri tat athwa unke apane bandargahon ko aadhaar banaakar shatrurajya ke viruddh akramanatmak karrwai nahin kerani chahie
 If the soldiers of the warring state attempt to pass through the jurisdiction of the neutral state, they should be forced to withdraw
 yadi ve tatasth rajya ke adhikarashetra main pravesh karne main safal ho jaaen to tatasth rajya ko chahie ki vah unke shastr rakhwakar unhen najarband kar le
 As far as the prisoners of war are concerned, on entering any neutral state, they go free because of their entry there
 parantu tatasth rajya kaa kartavya he ki vah unhen apni sena main jaakar pun: kaam karne kii anumati na pradaan karen
 Violations of neutrality are considered international crimes, then violating its rules, whether a neutral state commits against a warring state, whether a warring state commits against a neutral state
 in ulalanghanon kaa turant pratikaar hona chahie
 The party who has been tortured can demand compensation from the oppressed side
 peedit rajya atyaachaari rajya ke viruddh yuddh bhi kar saktaa he
 According to the prevailing meaning of the law of the present day regarding the right to force the property of a neutral state, any warring state is required to use or destroy the property of the neutral state if it is necessary for attack or protection
 Is empowered
 is adhikaar kaa prayog tatasth rajya ke adhikarashetra ke bheetar bhi kiya ja saktaa he, shatrupradesh ke antargat bhi kiya ja saktaa he or khule samudr ke bheetar bhi
 The warring state cannot compel a neutral state to do any service, ie if it voluntarily does any service, it is another matter
 yuddhrat rajya tatasth rajya kii sampatti kaa upyog kare athwa use nasht kar de to yuddhrat rajya ko uski kshatipurti kerani hogi

"is sil main jo chitra bana he vah rugveda kii ek richa se purnataya mail khaataa he
 Dva Suparna Sayuja Sakhaya Equal Tree Parvata Svajate
 tayoranyah pippalan swaadvatyanshnannanyo abhichaakashiti
 
 kuch deshbhakt jaise bal gangadhar tilak bhi in angrejon kii baton main aa gaye or utpurang dhang se likhane lage
 When asked, he said that whatever he wrote, he wrote it after studying the Vedic translation of the British
 bharat to ab swatantra ho gaya parantu angrejon kaa boyaa yah paudha aaj bhi fal or phool rahaa he
 The Indian government and people are still lying in such stupidity, a proof of this is a version of Muslim India which was printed on 27 March 1985
 bhartiya vidyalayon main yahi bataaya, padhaayaa jaataa rahaa; isise bharat kaa bhavishya gyaat ho jaataa he
 India is infected with this insane ideology even after independence, the direct evidence of this was the low point of Mr
 Frank Anthony, which he put before the Parliament on 4 September 1977
 vaidicon kaa yah sarvasvagranth 'vedatrayee' ke naam se bhi vidit he
 Earlier this Veda Granth was the same name as Yajurveda - Ekavasiidyajurveda Chaturdha: Personally again, the same Yajurveda became famous as rik-yajusva-samas, from which it was called 'trilogy'
 Later it became very difficult to read Veda, so three or four divisions of the same Veda were done
 tab unako rigyajusamke rupame vedatrayee athwa bahut samay baad rigyajusamatharv ke rup main chaturveda kahalaane lage
 Mantras were categorized on the basis of type and meaning
 iskaa aadhaar is prakaar he - The Vedic tradition is of two types - the Brahma tradition and the Aditya tradition
 dono parampara ke vedatrayee parampara pracheen kaal me prasiddh tha
 There are three styles of word usage in the world: poetry, prose and anthem
 vedon ke mantron ke 'padya, gadhy or gaan' aise teen vibhaag hote hai - There are definite rules of letter-number and foot and punctuation in the verse
 atah nishchit akshar-sankhya tathaa paad evam viraam vaale veda-mantron kii sangya 'rik' he
 Mantras, which do not have the letter number and foot and punctuation according to the rules of the verse, are called 'yajuha' and all the chants are lyrical, they are called 'sama'
 in teen prakaar kii shabd-prakaashan-shaileyon ke aadhaar par hi shaastra evam lok main veda ke liye ‘trayee’ shabd kaa bhi vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 The Yajurveda is a prose collection, so the verses of the Rigveda in this Yajurveda are recited as prose at the time of reading the Yajurveda
 dwaparayug kii samaapti ke purv vedon ke ukt chaar vibhaag alag-alag nahin the
 At that time, Rik, Yajuh and Sama - in these three word-styles, a specific study of the collective word-amount was called Veda
 peeche jaakar veda ke samakaksh me atharv bhi salagn ho gaya, phir 'trayee' ke jagah 'chaturveda' kahalaane lage | guru ke rusht hone par jinhone sabhi vedon ko aditya se praapt kiya he un yajyavlky ne apni smriti me vedatrayee ke baad or puranon ke aage atharv ko sammilit kar bolaa vedanstharvpuranani iti 
 The present-day Vedas are four - but earlier they were the same
 vartmaan kaal main veda chaar maane jate hai
 But these four together were considered to be a single 'veda Granth'
 lakshantah trayee hote huye bhi veda ek hi tha, phir usko charbhagame baanta gaya
 Due to the spread of hearing and memorization from generation to generation, the creator Brahmaji also has Shruti, Amnaya due to self-proof, Amauya due to self-attestation, and Apoorusheya, etc
, due to attaining the form of Aaurusheya Vani
 veda ke pathan-pathan ke kram main gurumukh se shravan evam yaad karne kaa veda ke sangrakshan evam safalataa kii drushti se atyant mahatva he
 For this reason Veda is also called "shruti"
 veda parishrampurvak abhyaas dwaara sangrakshniya he, is kaaran iskaa naam ‘'amnaay’' bhi he
 The Maharshiyans have created the Ashta deformity in the defense of Vedas - Jata Mala Shikha Rekha Dhwajo Dando Ratho Ghanah | Ashtau Deformity: Procto permutative Maharsay: || As a result of which, like ancient times, even today, there is chanting in the form of lust, long, stilted and sublime, unspoken vocal
 iske anusaar prayek shakha kii vaidic shabd-raashi kaa vargeekaran- upar varnit prayek veda ke chaar bhaag hote hai
 Apart from the first part of the mantra, the other three parts are not considered as Vedas, but such an idea has not been proved to be logical
 anadi vaidic parampara main mantra, brahman, aaranyak or upanishad ek hi vedake chaar avyav he
 Overall the parts of the Vedas are: - upar ke chaaron khand veda hone par bhi kuch log keval 'samhita' ko hi veda maanate hai
 At the end of Dwaparyug, Shri Krishna Dvapayan Ved Vyasa ji had four divisions of that Veda keeping in view the use of Yagyushthan and taught these four divisions to four disciples
 ye hi chaar vibhaag rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda ke naam se prasiddh he
 The four disciples named Pal, Vaishampayan, Jaimini and Sumantu taught the Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda respectively
 in chaar shishyon ne shakal aadi apane bhinn-bhinn shishyon ko padhaayaa
 Due to the propagation and preservation of the Vedas by these disciples under their own, they will be greatly expanded through the Vedic texts, Charan, Branch, Pratiksha and Anushaka
 The same preachers are famous by the name of sages
 purvokt chaar shishyone shurume jitne shishyonko anushravan karaayaa ve charansamuh kahalaaye | prayek charansamuhame bahutse shakha hote he
 And in this way Pratishakha, Anushakha etc
 became
 veda kii anek shakhaaen yani vyaakhyaan kaa tarika bataayi gayi hai
 According to the sage Patanjali's Mahabhashya, 21 of the Rigveda, 101 of Yajurveda, 1001 of Samaveda, 9 of Arthaveda have 1131 such branches, but today only 12 branches are available in the original texts
 veda kii prayek shakha kii vaidic shabdarashi chaar bhaagon main uplabdh he: 1
 samhita 2
 brahman 3
 aaranyak 4
 upanishad
 Some people consider the Samhita as Vedas
 shesh teen bhaag ko vedon ke vyakhya granth maanate hai
 In different branches, the original codes remain the same but there is a difference between the Aranyak and Brahmin texts
 kai mantra bhaag main bhi upanishad miltaa he jaisaa ki shuklayajurveda mantrabhagamen isavasyopanishad| puraane samay main jitani shakhaaen thi utani hi mantra, brahman, aaranyak or upanishad hote the |itani shakhaon ke babajud bhi aajkal kul 9 shakhaon ke hi granth milte hai
 In other branches, some mantras, some Brahmins, some Aranyakas and some Upanishads are found
 itane hi nahi adhik shakhaonke to upanishad hi paaya jaataa he ,tabhi to upanishad adhik milte hai
 The Vedic sages found the Vedas to be popular in public welfare
 veda shabd vid dhaatu main ghan pratyay lagane se bana he
 In the Sanskrit texts, adjectives such as vidya gyan and vidya gaina, realize the meaning of knowledge and benefit from vid dhatu
 vedon ke vishay unki vyakhya par nirbhar karte hai - agni, yajna, surya, indra, som, brahm, man-aatma, jagat-utpatti, padaarthon ke gun, dharm, daampaty, dhyaan-yoga, praan jaise vishay isamen barambar aate hai
 In the Yajna, the deity, matter, purpose, and method are appointed

 It has both prose and verse
 isamen yajna karm kii pradhanta he
 In ancient times it had 101 branches but at present it has only five branches - Kathak, Kapisthal, Maitrayani, Taittiriya, Vajasaneyi
 is veda ke do bhed hai - krishna yajurveda or shukla yajurveda
 Maharishi Veda Vyasa has compiled Krishna Yajurveda
 iskaa doosraa naam taittiriya samhita bhi he
 Mantra and Brahmin parts are mixed in it
 shukla yajurveda - ise surya ne yajyavlky ko upadesh ke rup main diya tha
 It had 15 branches but at present Madhyandin also known as Vajasaneyi
 isamen 40 adhyay, 303 anuwak evam 1975 mantra hai

 Thus there are a total of 650 spells in the Purvartik
 chah prapathak hai
 Uttarachik is divided into 21 chapters

 It has a total of 1225 mantras
 is prakaar samaveda main kul 1875 mantra hai
 Most of the mantras in it are derived from the Rigveda
 ise upasna kaa pravartak bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 Many subjects are described in this, Mathematics, Science, Ayurveda, Sociology, Agricultural Science, etc
 kuch log isamen mantra-tantra bhi khojate hai
 While this Veda preaches Brahm Gyan, it also explains the way of salvation
 ise brahm veda bhi kehete hai
 It is also called Atharva Angiras mainly due to the mantras of Rishis and Atharvan
 yah 20 kandon main vibhakt he
 There are many sutras in each kand and there are mantras in sutras
 is veda main kul 5977 mantra hai
 Its two branches Shaunik and Piplad are available today
 atharvaveda kaa vidvan chaaron vedon kaa gyaata hota he
 In the Yajna, the Rigveda calls for the Gods, the Samaveda is the oblation, the Yajurveda's Adhvaryu Dev: finishes the coterm and the Atharvaveda's Brahma controls the entire Yagya Karma
 ayurveda, dhanurveda, gandharvaveda tathaa sthapatyaved- ye kramshah chaaron vedon ke upved katyayan ne batalaaye hai
 For all round practice of Vedas, there are texts of education, kalpa, grammar, nirukta, chhanda and astrology which are called 6 parts
 pratipadsutra, anupad, chandobhasha, dharamshastra, nyaay tathaa vaisheshik- ye 6 darshana upang granth bhi uplabdh he
 The topics of appendages are as follows - veda kii samhitaon main mantraksharon main khadi tathaa aadi rekhaayen lagaakar unke ucch, madhyam, yaa mand sangitamay swar uccharan karne ke sanket kiye gayi hai
 They are named as the sublime, Anudatta and Swarit
 ye swar bahut pracheen samay se prachlit hai or mahamuni patanjali ne apane mahabhashya main inke mukhya mukhya niyamon kaa samavesh kiya he
 Vowels are spoken more or less as they also have two distinctions
 jaise udaatt-udaattatar, anudaatt-anudaattatar, swarit-swaritodatt
 Apart from these, there is considered to be another vowel - Shruti - the three vowels merge in it
 is prakaar kul swaron kii sankhya 7 ho jaati he
 Even in these seven vowels, there is a distinction between the vowels for which there is some change in the vowels
 yadhyapi in swaron ke ankan or tankan main kai vidhiyaan prayog kii jaati hai or prakaashak-bhashyakaron main koi ek vidha saamaanya nahin he, adhikansh sthanon par anudaatt ke liye akshar ke neeche ek aadi lakeer tathaa swarit ke liye akshar ke upar ek khadi rekha banane kaa niyam he
 Sublime has no sign of its own
 isse ankan main samasya aane se kai lekhak-prakaashak swar chihnon kaa prayog hi nahin karte
 There are many types of verses used in Vedic mantras, the main ones are- iske anusaar vedokt yagyon kaa anushthan hi veda ke shabdon kaa mukhya upyog mana gaya he
 From the beginning of the creation, there has generally been a diversity in the style, chanting and rituals of chanting
 is vividhta ke kaaran hi vedon kii shakhaon kaa vistaar hua he
 There are 21 branches of Rigveda, 101 branches of Yajurveda, 1000 branches of Samaveda and 9 branches of Atharva Veda - thus there are a total of 1,131 branches
 is sankhya kaa ullekh maharishi patanjali ne apane mahabhashya main bhi kiya he
 Out of the above 1,131 branches, currently only 12 branches are available in the original texts: - uparyukt 12 shakhaon main se keval 6 shakhaon kii adhyayan-style praapt he-shakal, taittareey, madhyandini, kaanv, kauthum tathaa shaunak shakha
 It would also not be inappropriate to say that some other texts of other branches are available, but they cannot get full introduction of the branch and the names of many branches are also not available
 jaisaa ki upar likhaa he, vedon ke kai shabdon kaa samajhnaa utana saral nahin rahaa he
 In order to understand the real meaning of Vedanka, Vedangauka was invented from within
 Because of this, the meanings described in them cannot be known
 Most of the controversies have been about the nature of God, that is, the one or the like of many gods
 vedonke vaastavik arth vahi kar saktaa he jovedang- shiksha,kalp, vyakaran, nirukt,chand or jyotishka gyaata he
 The interpretation of Sanskrit scholars of Europe has also been inspired by the theory of indo-aryan caste
 pracheen kaal main hi inaki satta ko chunauti dekar kai aise mat prakat hue jo aaj bhi dharmik mat kehalaate hai lekin kai roopon main bhinn hai
 Their main differences are explained below
 uname se jiskaa apana avichhinn paramparase veda,shakha,or kalpasutron se nirdeshit hokar ek adwitiya brahmatatvako iswar maanakar kisi ek devvadame na ulajhakar vedavadame raman karte hai ve vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm mananevaale he ve hi vedonko sarvopari maanate he
 Apart from this, there are some sects who hold different views and consider them as separate gods
 jin vishyon par vivaad rahaa he unka varnan neeche diya he
 Yajna: There is a contradiction in many scholars, opinions and commentators regarding the importance of the present form of Yajna
 yajna main aag ke prayog ko pracheen parsi pujan vidhi ke itnaa samaan hona or havan kii atyadhik mahatta ke prati vidwaanon main ruchi rahi he
 Deity: There has been disagreement among many scholars about the word Dev
 vedokt nirgun- niraakaar or sagun- saakaar me se antim pakshako maanane vaale kai maton main ise mahamanushya ke rup main vishisht shakti praapt saakaar charitra masajhate hai or unka murti rup main pujan karte hai to anya kai inhen ishwar ke hi naam bataate hai
 Philanthropic things, learned people and guiding mantras have been called devas
 udaahranarth agni shabd kaa arth aag na samajhakar sabase aage yani pratham yani parameshwar samajhate hai
 The meaning of the deity Shavad is considered divine, that is, full of the power of God - like earth etc
 isi mat main mahadev, devon ke adhipati hone ke kaaran ishwar ko kehete hai
 Similarly, due to the universal God Vishnu and truth everywhere, it is called Brahma
 is prakaar brahma, vishnu or mahadev kisi charitra ke naam nahin balki ishwar ke hi naam he
 Vedic and temporal words are used to determine the meaning of grammar and nirukta
 iske abhavame arthke anarth kar baithte he
 Similarly, Ganesh, Prajapati, Devi, Buddha, Lakshmi etc
 are the names of God
 vedadi shastronme aae vibhann ek hi parameshwarake he
 As has been said in the Upanishads - Eko Dev Sarvabhuteshu Gudha: Omnipresent Sarvabandhatra Some people quarrel in the nature of God
 inmese koi murtipuja karte he or koi aise log he jo murtipuja ke viruddh hai or ishwar ko ekmaatr satya, sarvopari samajhate hai
 Ashwamedha: From Ashwamedha comes the idea of violence and sacrifice
 yah kai hinduon ko bhi ascharyajanak lagata he kyonki kai sthanon par shuddhtavaadi hinsa se parhez karte rahe hai
 Many believe that Advaram is also used in the word Medha, which means non-violence
 atah medh kaa bhi arth kuch or rahaa hoga
 Similarly, the meaning of the word Ashwa must have been power rather than horse
 shriram sharma acharya krit bhaashayon ke anusaar ashv shabd kaa arth shakti, gau shabd kaa arth poshan he
 With this, the meaning of Ashwamedha seems to be different from horse sacrifice
 som:kuch log ise sharaab maanate hai lekin kai anuwaadon ke anusaar ise kuta-piskar banaaya jaataa tha
 Therefore, it does not look like a drink
 par iske asli rup kaa nirdhaaran nahin ho paaya he
 Tantalum carbide is an inorganic compound
 shahpur pakistan main punjab praant main sargodha jila main pashchimi ore sthit ek shahar he
 It is situated on the banks of river Jhelum
 iskaa purv naam rampur tha or bhartiya swatantraaa purv 17veen shatabdi tak yahaan hindu bahumat hua karata tha
 After Sufi saint Shah Shamus Shirazi arrived here from Delhi, it got its name Shahpur
 marina bich dakshin bharat kaa chennai mahanagar main ek bich he
 This beach is one of the longest coast in the world
 har manushya kaa apana-apana vyaktitv he
 That is the identity of man
 koti-koti manushyon kii bheed main bhi vah apane niraale vyaktitv ke kaaran pahchaan liya jayega
 This is his trait
 yahi uskaa vyaktitv he
 It is a law of nature that the shape of one human being is different from another
 akruti kaa yah janmajaat bhed akruti tak hi simit nahin he; uske swabhaav, sanskaar or uski pravritiyon main bhi vahi asamanta rahati he
 This inequality is the beauty of creation
 prakruti har pal apane ko naye rup main sajaati he
 We cannot see this change occurring in the same way that we cannot make any difference between one rose flower and another
 parichit vastuon main hi ham is bhed kii pahchaan aasaani se kar sakate hai
 We can easily identify this distinction only in familiar objects
 yah hamaari drushti kaa dosha he ki hamaari ankhen sookshm bhed ko or prakruti ke sookshm parivartanon ko nahin parakh paatin
 It is also a very difficult task to test the human character, but it is not impossible
 kathin vah keval isliye nahin he ki usamen vividh tattvon kaa mishran he balki isliye bhi he ki nity nai paristhitiyon ke aghat-pratighaat se vah badalata rahata he
 It is a conscious object
 parivartan uskaa swabhaav he
 It cannot be analyzed by placing it in the test tube of the laboratory
 uske vishleshan kaa praytn sadiyon se ho rahaa he
 Thousands of years ago our thinkers analyzed it
 aaj ke manovaigyanik bhi isi main lage hue hai
 Still, it cannot be said that any satisfactory analysis of human character has been done
 har balak angadh pathar kii tarah he jisamen sundar murti chhipi he, jise shilpi kii aankh dekh paati he
 He can cut it into a beautiful idol
 kyonki murti pehle se hi pathar main maujuud hoti he shilpi to bas us phaltu pathar ko jisamen murti dhaki hoti he, ek taraf kar detaa he or sundar murti prakat ho jaati he
 Parents give beautiful personality to the teacher and society by grooming the child in the same way
 vyaktitv-vikaas main vanshanukram tathaa parivesh do pradhan tatva hai
 Inheritance confers innate powers to a person
 parivesh use in shaktiyon ko siddhi ke liye suvidhaayen pradaan karata he
 The social environment strongly influences the personality of the child
 jyon-jyon balak viksit hota jaataa he, vah us samaaj yaa samudaay kii style ko aatmsaat kar letaa he, jisamen vah bada hota he, vyaktitv par gahari chhap chhodte hai
 The word 'charitra' refers to the entire personality of man
 ‘apane ko pahachaano’ shabd kaa vahi arth he jo ‘apane charitra ko pahachaano’ kaa he
 When the Upanishads had said: 'atma vare srotavya mantanto nididhyasitavya; Nanyatoऽi Vijānta, 'then it was the inspiration to recognize this unintelligent human character
 yunaan ke mahaan darshanik sucraat ne bhi pukaar-pukaar kar yahi kaha tha: apane ko pahachaano ! Science has been very successful in identifying the human body
 kintu uski aantarik prayogshaala abhi tak ek gudh rahasy bani hui he
 The answer to the question of how the machinery works inside this wall is still hidden in a misty mist
 jo kuch ham jaanate hai, vah keval hamaari buddhi kaa anumaan he
 Authentically we cannot say that this is true; Suffice it to say that we could not get a more clear answer than this
 apane ko pahchaanane kii ichha hote hi ham yah jaanane kii koshish karte hai ki ham kin baton main anya manushyon se bhinn he
 This quest to know the difference forces us to first know what we are like in others
 samaantaaon kaa gyaan hue bina bhinnata kaa yaa apane vishesh charitra kaa gyaan nahin ho saktaa
 Psychology has discovered that every human being is born with certain tendencies
 ye swaabhaavik, janm-jaat pravritiyaan hi manushya kii pratham prerak hoti hai
 As human beings, every human being has to limit his or her scope within the limits of these tendencies
 in pravritiyon kaa sachcha rup kya he, ye sankhya main kitni hai, inkaa santulan kis tarah hota he, ye rahasy abhi puri tarah spasht nahin ho paae hai
 Nevertheless some primary trends can be named authentically
 unamem se kuch ye hai : To fear, to laugh, to protect oneself, to try new things, to meet others, to value oneself, to collect, to try to fill the stomach, to desire different vaginal pleasures — to make a scientific definition of these tendencies It is a difficult task
 inamen se bahut-si aisi hai jo jaanwaron main bhi pai jaati hai kintu kuch bhaavnaatmak pravritiyaan aisi bhi hai, jo pashuon main nahin he
 They are simply the human instincts
 sangrah karnaa, swayan ko mahatva main laana, rachanaatmak kaary main santosh anubhav karnaa, dayaa dikhaanaa, karunaa karnaa aadi kuch aisi bhavanaaen hai, jo keval manushya main hoti hai
 These trends in seed form always remain in human nature
 phir bhi manushya iskaa gulam nahin he
 With his intelligence, he arranges these trends in such a way that these trends can help in upgrading his personality
 is vyavastha ke nirmaan main hi manushya kaa charitra banataa he
 This is the role of character-building
 apni swaabhaavik pravritiyon kaa aisa sankuchan karnaa ki ve uski kaary-shakti kaa daman na karte hue use kalyaan ke maarg par chalaane main sahaayak hon, yahi adarsh vyavastha he or yahi charitra-nirmaan kii prastaavna he
 The name of this system is Yoga
 isi santulan ko hamaare shastron ne ‘samatv’ kaha he
 This is yoga - 'samtvam yoga uchyate' this is what yoga has called 'yoga: karmasu kaushalam'
 pravritiyon main santulan karne kaa yah kaushal hi vah kaushal he jo jivan ke har kaary main safalataa detaa he
 It is said in the Gita for this same wisdom: yah santulan manushya ko swayan karnaa hota he
 That is why we say that man is the master of his own destiny
 vah apana charitra swayan banaata he
 Nobody gets character as succession
 apane mata-pita se ham kuch vyaavhaarik baat sikh sakate hai, kintu charitra ham apana swayan banaate hai
 Sometimes there are similarities between the character of the parents and the son, that too in succession, but in the son of the circumstances
 koi bhi balak achche yaa bure charitra ke saath paidaa nahin hota
 Yes, he is born in good and bad circumstances, which affects his character building
 kai baar to ek hi ghatana manushya ke jivan ko itnaa prabhavit kar detii he ki uskaa charitra hi palat jaataa he
 His approach towards life itself changes
 niraashaa kaa ek jhonka use sadaiv ke liye nirashaavadi bana detaa he, yaa achaanak aashaatheet sahanubhuti kaa ek kaam use sadaa ke liye tarun or paropkaaree bana detaa he
 That only becomes our nature
 isliye yahi kahana thik hoga ki paristhitiyaan hamaare charitra ko nahin banaatin, balki unke prati jo hamaari maansik pratikriyaayein hoti hai, unheen se hamaara charitra banataa he
 Every human mind has a different reaction to the same event
 ek hi saath rahane vaale bahut-se yuvak ek-si paristhitiyon main se guzarate hai; kintu un paristhitiyon ko prayek yuvak bhinn drushti se dekhtaa he; uske man main alag-alag pratikriyaayein hoti he
 These reactions help us to make a vision of our life
 in pratikriyaaon kaa prakat rup vah he jo us paristhiti ke prati ham kaary-rup main laate hai
 On seeing a beggar, kindness arose in the mind of one, awakened in the mind of another
 dayardra vyakti use paisa de degaa, doosraa use dutkaar degaa, yaa swayan vahaan se dur hat jayega
 However, the impact of the reaction will not be limited to this extent
 yah to us pratikriya kaa bahm rup he
 Its effect will be different on the minds of both
 inhen nityprati ke prabhaavon se charitra banataa he
 This is the process of making of the character
 isi prakriya main kuch log sanshayshil, kuch aatmavishvasi or kuch shaareerik bhogon main anand lene vaale vilaasi ban jate hai; kuch naitik siddhanto par drudh rahanevaale tapasvi ban jate hai, to kuch log turant laabh kii ichha karanevaale adheer or duusare aise ban jate hai jo dhairyapurvak kaam ke parinaam kii pratiksha kar sakate hai
 This process begins from childhood
 jivan ke tisare varsh se hi balak apana charitra bananaa shuru kar detaa he
 All children live in different circumstances
 un paristhitiyon ke prati manobhaav banane main bhinn-bhinn charitron vaale mata-pita se bahut kuch sikhte hai
 They also learn from their teachers or peers
 kintu jo kuch ve dekhte hai yaa sunate hai, sabhi kuch grahan nahin kar sakate
 It is so conflicting that it is not possible to accept it
 grahan karne se purv unhen chunaav karnaa hota he
 One has to decide for himself which qualities are acceptable and which are castable
 yahi chunaav kaa adhikaar bachche ko bhi aatmanirnay kaa adhikaar detaa he
 That is why we say that we are not slaves to the circumstances, rather our mental reaction to those situations builds our character
 hamaari nirnayaatmak chetanta jab puri tarah jaagarit ho jaati he or hamaare naitik aadarshon ko pahchaanane lagati he to ham paristhitiyon kii zaraa bhi parvaah nahin karte
 God has given this right to self-judgment to every human being
 antim nishchay hamen swayan karnaa he
 We are our owners; Create our own character
 aisa na ho to jivan main sangharsh hi na ho; paristhitiyaan swayan hamaare charitra ko bana den, hamaara jivan kathputli kii tarah bahya ghatnaon kaa gulam ho jaae
 Fortunately, it is not so
 manushya swayan apana swami he
 He creates his own character
 charitra-nirmaan ke liye use paristhitiyon ko anukool yaa sabal banane kii nahin balki aatmanirnay kii shakti ko prayog main laane kii aavashyaktaa he
 But the power of self-determination will be used only if we keep on trying to keep the soul worthy so that it can decide
 nirnay ke adhikaar kaa prayog tabhi ho saktaa he, yadi uske adheen kaary karanevaali shaktiyaan uske vash main hon
 The ruler can use his decision only if his subjects are under his control
 isi tarah yadi hamaari swaabhaavik pravritiyaan hamaare vash main hongi, tabhi ham aatmanirnay kar sakenge
 If any one trend becomes rebellious, if we start an independent monastery, then our entire moral system will be disturbed
 isliye hamaari swaabhaavik pravritiyaan hi hamaare charitra kii sabase badi dushman hai
 Character-building cannot begin without taming them
 naitik jivan prarambh karne se purv hamen unki bagdor apane haath main leni hogi
 They need to be brought in a system
 iskaa yah abhipraay nahin ki un pravritiyon ko maar dena hoga
 It is neither possible nor necessary to kill them
 hamen unki disha main parivartan karke unhen rachanaatmak kaaryon main lagaana he
 Those tendencies are like the stream which can be brought under control, irrigate fields, generate electricity and which can remain big and ruin even big cities
 in pravritiyon kaa sanyam hi charitra kaa aadhaar he
 Without restraint man cannot think pure, cannot become intelligent
 gita main kaha gaya he ki indriyon kii pravritiyaan jiske vash main hon—usee kii pragna pratishthit hoti he
 Pragya is in all humans
 buddhi kaa vardaan manushya-maatr ko praapt he
 But the eminent prince or situated prince will be the one whose tendencies will be in his control
 is tarah kii sabal pragna hi aatm-nirnay kaa adhikaar rakhti he
 It is this wisdom that makes a human character by not accepting slavery to circumstances
 jisaki buddhi swaabhaavik pravritiyon, vishayvasanaon ko vash main nahin kar sakegi, vah kabhi sachharitra nahin ban saktaa
 It should be remembered that we can restrain tendencies only on the strength of intellect
 jivan ke samudr main jab pravritiyon kii aandhi aati he to keval buddhi ke mastul hi hamen paar lagaate hai
 i have called the subjects a thunderstorm, they have the velocity of thunderstorms and they are very difficult to control - that's why it is said
 anyathaa inamen aandhi kii kshanikta nahin he
 These subjects always remain in human beings as trends
 usee tarah jaise pawan ke rup main aandhi akaash main rahati he
 The same wind when it is intensified due to a special combination of some elements of a sky, becomes a thunderstorm
 hamaari pravritiyaan bhi jab bhaawanaaon ke vishesh mishran se teevr ho jaati hai to teevr vasanaayen ban jaati hai
 They can not be completely suppressed
 buddhi dwaara unhen kalyankari dishaao main pravrutt hi kiya ja saktaa he, unka sanyam kiya ja saktaa he
 As simple as the word sobriety has become, it is equally difficult to give practical success to it
 is kathinaayee ke kaaran hai
 The main reason is that the tendencies we want to moderate are our natural tendencies
 unka janm hamaare janm ke saath hua he
 We tend spontaneously to him
 isliye ve bahut saral he
 Apart from this, their existence is also necessary for us
 un pravritiyon ke bina ham koi bhi cheshtaa nahin kar sakate
 Without them we will be exhausted; Not only the extraction, we will also become insecure
 prayek swaabhaavik pravriti isi suraksha or prerana kii sandeshhar hoti he
 Take for example the feeling of fear
 ham bhaybheet tabhi hote hai jab kisi pratikul shaktishaalee vyakti yaa paristhiti se yuddh karne main apane ko asamarth pate hai
 At that time the feeling of fear awakens in the heart and motivates us to protect ourselves by running away, by stealth or by any deception
 yadi ham is tarah batch nikalne kaa upaay na karen to jaan se haath dho baithen athwa kisi musiibat main pad jaaen
 Fear warns us of impending destruction
 bhay hi hamen yah batalaata he ki ab yah rasta badalakar nayaa rasta pakado
 We are disturbed for a while
 pratyutpannmati log naye raste kaa avlamb praapt karke bhay ke kaarnon se batch nikalate hai
 They get new knowledge of the difficulties of their situation
 un nai kathinaaiyon par shaanti se vichaar karke nayaa samaadhaan soch lete hai
 Therefore, we cannot deny the beneficial effect of fear
 kintu is prabhaav ko asthaayee maanakar ise kshanik mahatva dena hi upyukt he
 If this fear comes in our nature then we will always suffer from the feeling of failure
 bhay kaa arth kshanik asafalataa kaa digdarshan or naye udyog kii prerana honi chahie
 New excitement will create new enthusiasm in the mind
 jis tarah sher peeche hatakar hamalaa karata he, manushya oonchi chalaang maarane ke liye neeche jhukta he, usee tarah bhay se nai sphurti or nayaa sanket lene ke baad jab vah nayaa purusharth karne kaa sankalp karegaa, tabhi bhay bhaag jayega
 Constant failure and inability to fight against adversities make our fears permanent
 tab ham choti se choti pratikulata se bhi bhaybheet hone lagate hai
 Ignorantly we give more form to these dreadful situations
 hamaara agyaan hamaare bhay kaa saathi ban jaataa he, jinhen badalon main bijli kii kadak kaa vaigyanik kaaran maaloom nahin, ve yah kalpana kar lete hai ki do alokik daitya akaash main bhimkaay gadaaon se yuddh kar rahe hai
 The fear of electricity becomes invincible for them
 anek prakritik ghatnaon kii bhoot-preton kii ladaaiyaan maanakar ham sadaa bhayaatur rahane kaa abhyaas daal lete hai
 Physical phenomena such as solar eclipse, lunar eclipse, tailland, epidemic etc
 were considered to be terrible
 vigyaan ne jab se yah siddh kar diya he ki ye ghatnaayen manushya ke liye vinaashak nahin he, tab se sansar ke bahut-se bhayon kaa niraakaran ho gaya he
 But the scientists who tried to rid man of these false fears were given the death penalty
 baat yah he ki bhay kii yah bhaavana manushya ko kuch alokik shaktiyon par shraddha rakhane kii prerana detii he
 There is happiness in devotion
 vahi anand bhay paidaa karanevaali vastuon par shraddha rakhane main aane lagata he
 That is why we get our fear also enjoyable
 manushya kii ye manobhaavnaaen jo use kamazor banaati hai, jab ananprad ho jaaen to samajhnaa chahie ki hamaara rog asaadhya nahin to du:saadhy avashya ho gaya he
 Instead of thinking of ways to avoid fear, when a person starts worshiping fear, the hope of freedom from fear is very less
 us samay bhay kii pravriti manushya ko vas main kar leti he
 Our goal is to subdue the instinct of fear, not to become its slave
 manushya bhay kii pravriti kaa das kis tarah ban jaataa he, yah bhi ek manovaigyanik adhyayan he
 If a mad dog chases you, then you definitely get scared of that dog and you also get used to being afraid of him
 yah aadat yuktiyukt he
 This only means that you do not know the way to control the mad dog
 kintu jab aapako duusare kutton se bhi bhay maaloom hone lage to samaj lijie ki bhay kii aadat aapako vash main karne lagi he
 You should not be fearful unless you are determined to be mad at other dogs
 kintu dekha yah gaya he ki kamjor dil ke aadmi pagal kute se darane ke baad sabhi kutton se darana shuru kar dete hai
 This fear increases to such an extent that it starts to get scared by the quadruped
 is bhay ko vash main na kiya jaae to use bhayaavah vastu se sambandhit prayek vastu se hi bhay prathit hone lagata he
 a friend of mine once hit a head in the dark room with something
 uske baad unhen na keval us chiz se balki andhkaar se bhi dar lagane laga
 With the frightening object, he is scared of everything that reminds him
 bhay kaa yah kshetra bahut badhata jaataa he or iskaa prabhaav bhi manushya ke charitra par sthaayee hota jaataa he
 Unfortunately, if he has to go through many frightening situations simultaneously, he is always afraid; Every moment of life gives the message of death; The thunderous roar of the storm is heard in the sweet marbling of the air and the shaking of the leaves gives a scene of the cataclysm of the holocaust
 uskaa man sadaa veikshipt rahata he
 Such person never succeed in life
 bhay-nivaaran ke liye shastron main ish-vinay kii gai he : This prayer alone can not grant safe passage to man
 ishwar ne manushya ko bhay par vijay paane kaa saadhan pehle hi diya hua he
 Just as man has a tendency to be afraid of adversity, so is the tendency to fight against adversities and to keep his reputation
 in pravritiyon ko jaagrit karke manushya jab bhay ko jeetne kaa sankalp kar le, to vah swayan nirbhay ho jaataa he
 One tendency of man keeps on balancing the other trend
 jis tarah pravritiyaan swaabhaavik hai, usee tarah santulan bhi swaabhaavik prakriya he
 In the natural state, this work happens on its own
 kintu hamaara jivan keval prakritik avasthaaon main se nahin guzarataa
 With the grace of science, our life becomes unnatural and odd every day
 hamaari paristhitiyaan asaadhaaran hoti jaati he
 Our life is becoming more adventurous and fast
 sangharsh badhata hi jaataa he
 To survive we also have to fight hard
 jeene kii pratiyogita main keval shaktishaalee hi jitate hai
 Only the fittest have the right to live
 1–is sthapana se prayek saadhaaran vyakti ko praanon kaa bhay laga rahata he
 This fear is absorbed into our vein
 talad, someshwar tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke almoda jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Faith has increased and Shivamangal is the creation of Singh Suman

 naatak- prakruti purush kalidas This article has been translated from this version of the Wikipedia article Black hole
 saamaanya saapekshata main, kalachhidr yaa blike hole yaa krishna vivar itane shaktishaalee gurutvkarshan kshetra vaali koi aisi khagoleey vastu hoti he jiske khinchaav se prakaash-sahit kuch bhi na batch sake
 Around the black hole there is a boundary called the event horizon in which things can fall but nothing can come out
 ise "kaala" isliye kaha jaataa he kyonki yah apane upar padane vaale saare prakaash ko avashoshit kar letaa he or kuch bhi paravartit nahin karata
 It is exactly like a perfect black body in thermodynamics
 kalenidr kaa kwantum vishleshan yah darshata he ki unamem taapmaana or hawking vikiran hota he
 Despite its invisible interior, a black hole can make its presence visible through interactions with other substances
 masalan kalenidr kaa pataa taron ke kisi samooh kii gati se lagaaya ja saktaa he jo antariksh ke khaali dikhaai dene vaale ek hisse kii parikrama kar rahe hon
 Alternatively, with a companion star, you can see the gas dropping into a relatively small black hole
 yah gas sarpil aakaar main andar kii taraf aati he, bahut ucch taapmaana tak garm ho kar badi maatra main vikiran chhodti he jiskaa pataa prithvi par sthit yaa prithvi kii kaksha main gumti doorabeenon se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 As a result of such observations, a scientific consensus has emerged that, despite their non-appearance, black holes exist in our universe
 inhen vidhiyon se vaigyanikon ne pataa lagaaya he ki hamaari gallexi, kshirmarg, ke kendra main sthit dhanu e* naamak radio strot main ek vishalkay kalachhidr sthit he jiskaa dravyaman hamaare suraj ke dravyaman se 43 lakh guna he
 Theoretically, a substance of any quantity can become a black hole if it is compressed within a space whose radius is equal to its equivalent Schwarzschild radius
 iske anusaar hamaare surya kaa dravyaman 3 ki

 kii trigya tathaa prithvi kaa 9 mi

 ke andar hone par yah kalenidr main parivartit ho sakate hai
 In contrast to electron and neutron contingency pressure, neither the Earth nor the Sun have the required mass and therefore neither the required gravitational force
 in dabaavon se ubarkar or adhik sankuchit hone main sakasham hone ke liye ek taare ke liye aavashyak nunatam dravyaman tolman - oppenheimer - volcophf dwaara prastaavit had he, jo lagbhag teen saura dravyaman he
 a black hole is often defined as an object whose migration velocity is greater than the speed of light
 yah tasvirgunatmak rup se galat he lekin kalenidr kii trigya ke pariman ke kram ko samajhane kaa ek tarika pradaan karti he
 The escape velocity is the minimum speed an object must have so that the object escapes the orbit of a gravitational source before stopping
 prithvi par palaayan veg 11
2 kimi / second ke baraabar he, atah vastu chaahe koi bhi ho, ek goli yaa ek ball, ise prithvi kii sataha par waapas girane se bachane ke liye kam se kam 11
2 kimi / second kii gati se chalanaa hoga
 To calculate the migration velocity in Newtonian mechanics, suppose there is a heavy object whose mass m is centered at the origin
 ek m { \ displaystyle m} dravyaman vaali duusari vastu mul se r { \ displaystyle r} kii duuri par v { \ displaystyle v} gati se shuru hoti he, infinity kii taraf bachakar nikalne kii koshish karti he, iske paas thik utani gatij urja honi chahie taaki vah nakaaratmak gurutvkarshan kii sambhavit urja se paar paa sake, baad main kuch bhi shesh na rahe: Thus, as it gets closer to r = ∞ { \ displaystyle r = \ infty}, its kinetic energy decreases, eventually reaching infinity without any motion
 yah formula critical palaayan veg v { \ displaystyle v} ko m { \ displaystyle M} or r { \ displaystyle r} ke sandarbh main darshata he
 But this formula also says that for each value of v { \ displaystyle v} and m { \ displaystyle M}, r { \ displaystyle r} has a critical value so that v { \ displaystyle v} is a particle of motion
 Only managed to escape: jab veg prakaash kii gati ke baraabar ho, yah ek kaalpanik neutonian dark star kii trigya pradaan karata he, ek neutonian sharir jahaan se prakaash kii gati se chalane vaala koi kan batch nahin saktaa he
 In the trend most commonly used for the value of the radius of a black hole, the radius of the event horizon is equal to this Newtonian value
 saamaanya saapekshata main, antariksh-samay kii vakrit prakruti or vibhinn nirdeshaankon ke chayan kii vajah se r nirdeshaank ko paribhaashit karnaa saral nahin he
 For this result to be true, the value of r must be defined so that r radius in curved space times a surface area of A sphere can still be revealed by this formula a = 4 π r 2 { \ displaystyle a This definition of = 4 \ pi r ^ {2}} r makes sense only if the gravitational field is spherically symmetric, so that there are many jackals on top of one that have a uniform gravitational field
 kisi vastu ke gurutvkarshan kshetra se batch nikalne ke liye palaayan veg uske ghanatv par nirbhar karti he; yah he, uske dravyaman or maatra kaa anupaat
 a black hole is formed when an object becomes so dense that even light cannot escape from it for a particular distance, because the speed of light will be less than the escape velocity of the black hole
 neutonian gurutvkarshan ke vipareet, saamaanya saapekshata main, kalenidr se dur jaataa hua prakaash dhimaa nahin padataa he or vaapis nahin mudata he
 The Schwarzschild radius is still the last distance from which the light can escape to infinity, but the exit light, starting at the Schwarzschild radius, does not return, it remains outside
 schvarjaschild trigya andar, prayek vastu andar kii taraf gati karti he, kisi prakaar centre main kuchle jane hetu
 In general relativity, the mass of the black hole may remain centered on a gravitational singularity), it may be a point, a ring, a light beam, or a sphere; At present, exact information about it is not available
 is singhulerity ke aasapaas ek golakaar seemaa hoti he jise ghatana kshitij kaha jaataa he
 It is the 'returning place' to the event horizon, a boundary beyond which all matter and radiation are drawn towards the singularity within
 kendrastha is singhulerity or ghatana kshitij ke bich kii duuri kalenidr kaa aakaar hoti he or yah ikai main dravyaman ke dugane ke baraabar hoti he jahaan g or c baraabar 1 hai
 The radius of a black hole with a mass equal to the Sun is about 3 km
 isse kai guni adhik duriyon ke liye, kalenidr kii guruttvakarshan shakti samaan dravyaman vaale kisi bhi anya sharir kii guruttvakarshan shakti ke thik baraabar hoti he, bilkul surya ke samaan
 Therefore, if the Sun is converted into a black hole of equal mass, the orbits of the planets will remain unchanged
 kai prakaar ke kalenidr hai, jo unke vishisht aakaar dwaara pahachaane jate hai
 When they form due to the gravitational collapse of a star, they are called stellar black holes
 gallexiyon ke centre main banane vaale kalahidron ke dravyaman saura dravyaman ke kai arab guna ho sakate hai, unhen vishalkay kaala chhidr kaha jaataa he kyonki ve ati vishaal hote hai
 There are also some intermediate black holes between these two scales, whose mass is up to several thousand times the solar mass
 bahut kam dravyaman vaale kalenidr kaa, jinke bare main aisa mana jaataa he ki unka nirmaan brahmand ke shuruaati itihaas main big baing ke dauraan hua hoga, ab bhi astitv bhi ho sakate hai or unhen primoradial kalachhidr kaha jaataa he
 Presently, their existence is not yet certain
 pratyaksh taur par ek kalenidr ko dekh paanaa sambhav nahin he
 However, its presence can be gauged by its gravitational effect on the surrounding environment, particularly by microvasives and active galactic nuclei, where substances falling into nearby black holes overheat and emit large amounts of X-ray radiation Huh
 yah prekshan vidhi khagolavidon ko unke astitv kaa pataa lagane main sakasham banaati he
 Black holes are the only substances that meet these scales and conform to the framework of general relativity
 ek aise baari sharir kii avadharana jisase ki prakaash bhi bachane se asamarth ho ko, bhuvigyaani jon michel dwaara 1783 main henry kavendish ko likhe gayi ek patr main prakat kiya gaya tha or royal socity dwaara prakashit kiya gaya tha: In 1796, mathematician pierre-simon Laplace promoted the idea in the first and second editions of his book Exposition du sistem du Monde
 unnisvin sadi main in "dark stars" par dhyaan nahin diya gaya tha, kyonki tab aisa mana jaataa tha ki prakaash drabyaman rahit tarang he atah gurutv ke prabhaav se mukt he
 Contrary to the modern black hole concept, it was believed that the object behind the horizon could not collapse
 1915 main, albert oinstin ne apane saamaanya saapekshata ke siddhant ko viksit kiya, ve pehle hi yah siddh kar chuke the ki gurutvkarshan prakaash kii gati par vastav main prabhaav daalata he
 a few months later, Karl Schwarzschild gave the solution of the gravitational field of a point mass and a spherical mass, showing that the existence of a black hole is theoretically possible
 schvarjaschild trigya ko ab gaiyr-chakrit blike hole ke ghatana kshitij kii trigya ke rup main janaa jaataa he, lekin is tathy ko us samay nahin samajha ja sakaa tha, udhaaharan ke liye schvarjaschild khud ise bhautik nahin maanate the
 Johannes Droste, a student of Hendrik Lorentz, independently gave a similar solution a few months after Schwarzschild on point mass and wrote extensively more about its properties
 1930 main, khagolvid subramanyan chandrashekhar nen saamaanya saapekshata kaa upyog karte hue yah gananaa kii ki electron-dijanret padaarth vaale ek gaiyr-chakrit sharir kaa saura dravyaman yadi 1
44 se adhik hua to uskaa patan ho jaayegaa
 His argument was opposed by Arthur Eddington, who believed that something would surely prevent this collapse
 edington aanshik rup se sahi the: chandrashekhar seemaa se thoda adhik drabyaman vaala safed bouna sitara patan ke baad neutron taare main parivartit ho jaayegaa
 lekin 1939 main, robert oppenheimer or unke sahyogiyon ne bhavishyavaanee kii ki chandrasekhar dwaara die gaye kaarnon kii vajah se, lagbhag teen se adhik saura drabyaman vaale sitara kaa patan ek blike hole ke rup main ho jaayegaa
 Oppenheimer and his co-authors used the Schwarzschild coordinate system, which produced mathematical specificity at the Schwarzschild radius, in other words, some of the components used in this equation became infinite at the Schwarzschild radius
 iskaa arth yah niklaa gaya ki schvarjaschild trigya ek "bulbule" kii seemaa thi jisamen samay "ruk" jaataa tha
 This is a valid point of view from outside, but not for those who fall inside
 is visheshta ke kaaran, patan ho chuke taron ko kuch samay ke liye "frozen stars " ke naam se janaa gaya, kyonki ek bahari paryvekshak ko taare kii sataha us samay main jami hui dikhaai degaa jis pal main taare kaa patan use schvarjaschild trigya ke andar le ja rahaa hoga
 This is a known feature of modern black holes, but it must be emphasized that the surface light of the frozen star redshifts very quickly and turns the black hole to black very quickly
 kai bhautikavid is vichaar ko sweekaar nahin kar paa rahe the ki schvarjaschild trigya ke bheetar samay ruk jaataa he or 20 varshon tak is bishay par logon ki ruchi nahin rahi thi
 In 1958, David Finkisten introduced the concept of the event horizon by presenting Eddington – Finkelstein coordinates, which enabled him to prove that the Schwarzschild surface r = 2 m is not a specificity but rather serves as an ideal monolithic membrane
 Is: The causal effects can cross it in one direction
 isamen or openhimer ke parinaamon ko koi khaas virodhabhas nahin tha, balki isane ek andar girte hue paryvekshak ke drushtikon ko shaamil karke iskaa vistaar hi kiya
 All theories up to now, including Finkelstein, covered only non-rotating black holes
 1963 main, roy ker ne aavarti blike hole ke liye ekadam sateek samaadhaan khoj liya
 Its rotated singularity was not a dot but a ring
 kuch samay baad, roger penros yah sabit karne main sakasham ho gayi ki singhulerity sabhi blike holon ke andar pai jaati hai
 In 1967, astronomers discovered Pulsar and within a few years were able to prove that the known Pulsars are fast-rotating neutron stars
 us samay tak, neutron taare bhi sirf saidhantik utsukata tak hi simit the
 Hence the discovery of pulsars aroused interest in all those high-density objects whose structure would have been possible by gravitational collapse
 bhautikavid jon whealer ko vyapak rup se 1967 main die gaye apane saarvajanik bhaashan hamaara brahmad: gyaat or agyaat main blike hole shabd ko gadhane kaa shrey diya jaataa he, adhik dushkar "gurutveey rup se purnatah patan ko praapt kar chukaa tara" ke ek vikalp ke rup main
 However, Wheeler insisted that the term was coined by someone else at the conference and he only adopted it as a useful short-word
 yah shabd 1964 main eni aving dwaara AAAS ko likhe ek patr main bhi uddhrut kiya gaya tha: When the entire fuel of a big star is burnt, a huge explosion occurs in it, which is called a supernova
 visphot ke baad jo padaarth bachataa he vah dhire dhire simatana shuru hota he or bahut hi ghaney pind kaa rup le letaa he jise neutron star kehete hai
 If the neutron star is too large, the pressure of gravity will be so low that it will shrink with its own weight and become so dense that a black hole will form and appear as a black hole, a black hole or a black hole
 no hair prameya main kaha gaya he ki, ek baar sthapit ho jane ke baad blike hole ke keval teen swatantra bhautik lakshan hote hai: dravyaman, charge or koniya gati
 If the values of these two black holes have the same values or parameters, then it becomes quite difficult to distinguish between them
 ye lakshan khaas hote hai kyonki ye blike hole ke baahar se dikhaai dete hai
 For example, a charged black hole, like any other charged object, pushes the same charge away, despite the fact that photons, which are responsible for the electrical and magnetic forces, do not escape the internal field
 iskaa kaaran he gous niyam, ek bade sphier se baahar nikalne vaala kul vidyut pravaah hameshaa samaan rahata he or sphier ke bheetar ke kul charge ko maapta he
 When the charge falls into the black hole, electric field lines persist and peek beyond the horizon, and these field lines conserve the total charge of all falling materials
 bijli kshetra line antat blike hole kii sataha par samaan rup se fail jaati hai, sataha par samaan kshetra line ghanatv sthapit karti hai
 In this context, the black hole acts like a common conducting sphere that has a certain resistivity
 isi tarah, blike hole ko samahit kiye hue ek sphere ke kul dravyaman ko gaus niyam ke gurutveey anuroop kaa upyog karke paaya ja saktaa he, blike hole se bahut dur baithe baithe
 Similarly, angular momentum can be measured from far away, by gravitational-magnetic field using frame dragging
 jab blike hole kisi padaarth ko nigalata he, uskaa kshitij gharshan yukt vistrut jhilli kii tarah dolan karata he, ek kshanik pranali, jab tak yah antim avasthaa main sthapit nahin ho jaataa
 This is different from other field theories such as electromagnetism or gauge theory, which never have any friction or resistivity because they are time reversible
 kyonki blike hole antat ek antim avasthaa main keval teen maapdandon ke saath sthapit hota he, praarambhik sthitiyon ke bare main jaankaree ko khone se bachaane kaa koi tarika nahin he: blike hole ke gurutvkarshan or vidyut kshetra uske andar jane vaali chizon ke bare main bahut kam jaankaree pradaan kar pate hai
 Missing information includes everything that cannot be measured at great distances from the black hole horizon, such as the total baryon number, the lepton number, and almost all other preserved pseudo-charges in particle physics
 yahan se karnaa he yah vyavhaar itnaa ajeeb he ki ise 'blike hole jaankaree nuksaan virodhabhas' kaha gaya he
 Traditionally, the disappearance of information in black holes is quite strange, because general relativity is a Lagrangian theory that appears to be time reversible and Hamiltonian from above
 lekin kshitij ke kaaran blike hole samay palatwaan nahin hota he: padaarth isamen ghus sakate hai par nikal nahin sakate
 The reversal of time in a common black hole is called a white hole, although entropy and quantum mechanics show that white holes are similar to black holes
 no-hair prameya hamaare brahmad or usamen shaamil padaarthon kii prakruti ke bare main kuch manyataon banaata he, jabaki anya manyatayen alag nishkarsh pradaan karti hai
 For example, if magnetic single-poles exist, as stated by some theories, magnetic charge would be the fourth parameter of a conventional black hole
 nimnlikhit maamalon ke liye no-hair prameya ke prati-udahaaran gyaat hai: These exceptions are sometimes unstable and sometimes do not lead away from black holes to newly preserved quantum numbers
 hamaare chaar-aiami or lagbhag sapaat brahmand main is prameya ko lagu hona chahie
 The simplest black hole is one that has a mass but has neither charge nor angular momentum
 in blike hole ko schvarjaschild blike hole ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, bhautikavid karl schvarjaschild ke naam par jinhone 1915 main is samaadhaan kii khoj kii thi
 This was the first reliable and accurate solution to be discovered for the Einstein field equation and according to the Birkhoff theorem it is the only vacuum solution that is spherically symmetric
 iskaa matlab yah he ki is tarah ke ek blike hole ke gurutvkarshan kshetra or samaan dravyaman kii kisi bhi anya golakaar vastu ke gurutvkarshan kshetra bich koi drishy antar nahin he
 For the black hole, the popular belief that it "pulls every object in" around itself is true only near its horizon; At a distance, its external gravitational field is essentially the same as that of ordinary heavy bodies
 blike hole ke adhik saamaanya samaadhaan 20 veen sadi ke uttarardh main khoje gayi the
 The Reisner – Nordström metric describes a black hole with electric charge, while the Kerr metric provides a rotating black hole
 kerr -newman metric saamanyatya adhik prachlit sthir blike hole samaadhaan he, jo charge or koniya gati donon kaa varnan karata he
 Although the mass of a black hole can take any positive value, charge and angular momentum are constrained by mass
 prakritik ikaayiyon main, kul charge q { \ displaystyle q \ ,} or kul koniya gati j { \ displaystyle j \ ,} se ummid kii jaati he ki ve nimnlikhit ko santusht karenge For a black hole with mass M
 is asamanta ko bharne vaale blike hole ko extrimal kaha jaataa he
 Solutions of Einstein's equations that violate inequality exist, but do not have horizons
 in samaadhaanon main nagn vishistataa he or inhen abhautik mana jaataa he, kyonki cosmik sensorship pariklpana vaastavik padaarthon ke samgr gurutvkarshan patan kii vajah se is vishistataa ko nakaar detii he
 This is supported by numerical representations
 vidyut chumbakeey bal kii apekshaakrit badi takat ke kaaran, taron ke patan se banane vaale blike hole se apeksha kii jaati he ki ve taron ke neutral charge ko banaaye rakhenge
 Rotation has been considered a common feature of compact objects and it appears that the angular momentum of the binary hole X-ray source GRS 1915 + 105, a candidate for a black hole, is close to its maximum possible value
 blike hole ko saamanytah unke dravyaman ke anusaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, koniya gati j { \ displaystyle j \ ,} se swatantra
 ghatana kshitij trigya, yaa shwarzschild trigya, dwaara nirdhaarit blike hole kaa aakaar dravyaman m { \ displaystyle m \ ,} ke anupaat main hota he, Where rsh { \ displaystyle r_ {sh} \ ,} is the Schwarzschild radius and m ⨀ { \ displaystyle m _ { \ bigodot}} is the mass of the Sun
 is prakaar ek blike hole kaa aakaar or dravyaman saadhaaran rup se sambandhit hote hai, roteshan se swatantra
 According to this criterion, black holes are classified as follows: blike hole kii vishistataa he ghatana kshitij kaa prakat hona; antariksh-samay kii ek seemaa jiske pare ghatnaayen ek bahari paryvekshak ko prabhavit nahin kar sakati hai
 As predicted by general relativity, the presence of mass distorts the space-time in such a way that the paths of the particles lead them to that mass
 blike hole ke ghatana kshitij par yah vikruti itani shaktishaalee ho jaati he ki baahar jane kaa koi maarg bachataa hi nahin he
 Once a particle enters the event horizon, it becomes inevitable to go inside the black hole
 dur khadey ek darshak ke liye, blike hole ke nikat kii ghadiyaan zyada dhire chalati prathit hongi
 Because of this effect, the spectator standing far away will notice that an object falling into a black hole slows down as it approaches its event horizon, seemingly taking infinite time to reach it
 usee samay is vastu kii sabhi kriyaayein dhimi ho jaati hai jiske parinaam swaroop nikalne vaala prakaash adhik laal or maddham prathit hota he, is prabhaav ko gravitational red shift kaha jaataa he
 Finally, the falling object becomes so dim that it stops appearing, at one point just before it reaches the event horizon
 gaiyr-chakrit blike hole ke liye schvarjaschild trigya spherical ghatana kshitij ko seemaa-mukt karti he
 The Schwarzschild radius of an object is proportional to the mass
 chakrit blike hole main vikrut, nonspherical ghatana kshitij hota he
 Since the event horizon is not a physical surface but only a mathematically defined boundary, there is nothing preventing matter or radiation from entering the black hole, only they are prevented from exiting
 blike hole ke liye saamaanya saapekshata dwaara diya gaya varnan ek sanniktan he or aisi apeksha kii jaati he ki kwantum gurutv prabhaav ghatana kshitij ke nikat se mahatvapurn ho jate hai
 This makes the observation of matter near the event horizon of a black hole, the study of general relativity and its proposed extents
 haalaanki blike hole swayan urja vikirit nahin karte hai, ghatana kshitij ke thik baahar se, hawking vikiran ke madhyam se, vidyut-chumbakeey vikiran or padaarth kan vikeern ho sakate hai
 Singularity occurs at the center of the black hole, where there is an infinite density due to the suppression of matter, the gravitational pull is infinitely powerful and there is infinite distortion in space-time
 iskaa matlab ek blike hole kaa dravyaman shunya volum vaale ek kshetra main purnatah sankuchit ho jaataa he
 This zero-volume, infinitely dense region at the center of a black hole is called gravitational singularity
 ek gaiyr-chakrit blike hole kii singhulerity kii lambaai, chaudai or oonchaai shunya hoti he; ek chakrit blike hole kii singhulerity challe ke aakaar kii hoti he or roteshan ke plane main sthit hoti he
 The rings have no thickness so there is no volume
 saamaanya saapekshata main singhulerity kii upasthiti ko saamanytah siddhant ke lagu na hone kaa sanket mana jaataa he
 Although this is expected; This occurs in situations where quantum mechanical effects should have been described, due to extremely high densities and particle interactions
 ab tak kwantum or gurutv ke prabhaav kaa ek hi siddhant main sangyojan karnaa sambhav nahin ho sakaa he
 It is generally expected that the theory of quantum gravity will contain black holes without singularity
 photone sphere shunya motaai vaali ek spherical seemaa he jahaan sphere kii sparsharekha main chalate hue photone ek gol kaksha main funs jaayenge
 For non-recurring black holes, the radius of the photon sphere is 1
5 times the Schwarzschild radius
 ye kakshaen gatisheel rup se asthir hai, isliye koi bhi choti si gadbady bhi samay ke saath badi hoti jaayegi or yaa to use blike hole ke pare phenk degi yaa ghatana kshitij ke bheetar dhakel degi
 Although light can still escape from inside the photon sphere, any light that crosses the photon region from the inside and outward trajectory will be occupied by a black hole
 isliye koi bhi prakaash jo photone sphere ke andar se baahar khadey ek darshak tak pahunchataa he, nishchit rup se photone sphere ke adanr parantu ghatana kshitij ke baahar kii kisi vastu dwaara utsarjit hua hoga
 Other compact objects such as neutron stars may also have photon spheres
 yah tathy is baat par aadhaarit he ki ek vastu kaa gurutv kshetra uske vaastavik aakaar par nirbhar nahin karata, isliye koi vastu jo schvarjaschild trigya ke 1
5 guna se adhik choti ho us, vastu ke drabyaman se sambandhit ek photone sphere vastav main hoga
 The rotating black hole surrounds the ergosphere salt in an inter-time zone in which it is impossible to stand still
 yah frem-dreging naamak ek prakriya kaa parinaam he; saamaanya saapekshata kii bhavishyavaanee he ki koi bhi chakrit drabyaman, swanyam ko ghere hue antariksh samay ko thodaa khinchne kii cheshtaa karegaa
 Any object near the rotating mass will start moving in the direction of the wheel
 ek chakrit blike hole ke liye ghatana kshitij ke paas iskaa prabhaav itnaa majboot ho jaataa he ki kisi vastu ko sthir khadey rahane maatr ke liye iske vipareet disha main prakaash ki gati se bhi tej chalanaa hoga
 The ergosphere of a black hole is surrounded by the following: argosphior ke bheetar, antariksh-samay prakaash se adhik gati se khinchaa jaataa he-- saamaanya saapekshata main bhautik vastuon kaa prakaash se tej gati se chalanaa varjit he, lekin antariksh-samay kshetron ko anumati detaa he ki ve anya antariksh-samay kshetron kii tulana main prakaash se tej chal saken
 Objects and radiation can remain in orbit within the ergosphere without falling into the center
 lekin ve mandara nahin sakate, kyonki iske liye unhen swayan ke antariksh-samay kshetra kii tulana main peeche kii ore prakaash se bhi tej chalane kii aavashyaktaa hogi, jo ek bahari darshak kii tulana main prakaash se tej chal rahe hai
 Objects and radiation can also escape from the ergosphere
 asal main penros prakriya bhavishyavaanee karti he ki vasteen kabhi kabhi agosphior ud kar baahar chali jaayengi, iske liye urja ve blike hole kii kuch urja ko "chura" kar praapt karengi
 If a large part of the total mass of objects escapes in this way, the speed of the black hole will slow down and eventually stop moving
 blike hole kii aakarshak chhavi ke kaaran yah sawaal uthanaa lajimi he ki kya vastav main is prakaar kii vicitra vastuon kaa astitv he, yaa ye oinstin samikarnon ke kaalpanik samaadhaan maatr he
 Einstein himself had the mistaken belief that the formation of black holes is not possible, as he believed that the angular momentum of particles leading to collapse would stabilize their motion
 isaki vajah se saamaanya saapekshata samudaay kai varshon tak iske virdohi parinaamon ko khaarij karata rahaa
 But some of them maintained the belief that black holes actually existed, and by the late 1960s they were able to convince most researchers that the creation of event horizons was indeed possible
 ek baar ek ghatana roger penros ne yah siddh kar diya ki uske bheetar kahin na kahin singulerity kaa nirmaan avashya hoga
 Shortly thereafter, Stephen Hawking demonstrated that syngularity existed in many cosmic solutions of the Big Bang, in the absence of scalar fields and other foreign matter
 kerr samaadhaan, no-hair prameya or blike hole ushmpravagiki ke niyamon ne darshaya ki blike hole ke bhautik lakshan saral hai or aasaani se samajhe ja sakate hai, inhen shodh ke sammanit vishyon kaa darja mil gaya
 It is believed that the primary process of building black holes may have been the gravitational collapse of heavy objects such as stars, but there are many other processes that can lead to the creation of black holes
 gurutveey patan tab hota he jab ek vastu kaa aantarik dabaav uske apane gurutvkarshan kaa virodh karne ke liye aparyaapt ho
 This usually occurs in stars because either the "fuel" is insufficient to maintain its temperature in the stars, or a star that was stationary would receive a lot of extra material but not raise its core temperature
 donon sthitiyon main, taare kaa taapmaana swayan ke vajan tale apane patan ko roak paane ke liye aparyaapt sabit hoga 
 This collapse can be prevented by the mutual pressure of the star components, the material condenses into an attractive dense state
 iskaa parinaam, ek prakaar kaa compact tara
 kis kism kaa compact tara banegaa yah avshesh ke drabyaman par nirbhar karegaa - patan ke kaaran hue parivartanon ke baad bache hue padaarthon nen bahari satahon ko nestnabud kar diya he
 Note that this will be much less than the original star - residues with more than 5 solar masses are produced by stars that must have been greater than 20 before their collapse
 yadi avshesh kaa dravyaman ~ 3-4 saura drabyaman se adhik ho-- kyonki mul tara yaa to bahut baari tha yaa avshesh ne atirikt drabyaman ekatra kar liya he)- neutron kaa apjaatya dabaav bhi patan ko rokane ke liye aparyaapt he
 After this, there is no known process that can stop this collapse and the object will degenerate into a black hole
 baari taron ke is gurutveey patan ko hi adhikansh taarakeey drabyaman vaale blike holon ke gathan ke liye jimmedaar mana jaataa he
 Gravitational collapse requires much higher density
 brahmad ke vartmaan yug main yah ucch ghanatv keval taron main hi milti he, lekin praarambhik brahmad main big baing ke sheeghra baad ghanatv kaaphi adhik hua karte the, ho saktaa he isi ne blike hole ke nirmaan ko sambhav banaaya ho
 High density alone is not sufficient for the creation of a black hole because the uniform distribution of masses will not allow the mass to accumulate
 is ghaney madhyam main pracheen blike holon ke gathan hetu, praarambhik ghantviya gadabadiyon kaa hona aavashyak he jo baad main swayan ke gurutv ke prabhaav main bad saken
 There are wide differences in the size of these disturbances in various models of the early universe
 vibhinn modelon ne blike hole ke nirmaan kaa purvanumaan lagaaya tha, plank dravyaman se lekar saikadon hajaaron saura drabyamanon tak ke
 Therefore, primitive black holes can be the reason for the formation of any type of black hole
 gurutveey patan hi ekmaatr prakriya nahin he jo blike hole kaa nirmaan kar sakati he
 In theory, the creation of black holes is also possible in high-energy collisions that create sufficient densities
 haalaanki, abhi tak, aisi kisi bhi aisi koi ghatana ko pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup main, kan twarak prayogon main drabyaman santulan kii kami ke rup main nahin paaya gaya he
 This implies that there should be a lower limit to the mass of the black hole
 siddhanthata, is seemaa ko plank dravyaman ke aasapaas hona chahie, jahaan aisi apeksha kii jaati he ki kwantum prabhaav saamaanya saapekshata ke siddhant ko galat sabit kar denge
 For this reason, the possibility of creation of a black hole on or around the Earth can be completely ruled out
 haalaanki, kwantum gurutv ke kuch vikaas aisa darshaate hai ki is bandha kii seemaa kaaphi neeche ho sakati he
 For example, some Brainworld landscapes keep the Planck mass far below, perhaps as low as 1 tev / c2
 yah, sookshm blike hole ke nirmaan ko ucch urja takkaron yaa CERN ke vishaal hadran colider main sambhav kar saktaa he
 However, all these theories are quite imaginary and many scientists are of the opinion that the creation of black holes in these processes is not possible
 ek baar banane ke baad blike hole, atirikt padaarthon ke avasorana dwaara viksit hona jari rakhata he
 All black holes will continue to absorb interstellar dust and ubiquitous radiation, but none of these processes have any significant effect on the mass of a stellar black hole
 adhik mahatvapurn yogadan tab hote hai jab ek blike hole kaa nirmaan ek dwiadhari tara pranali main hoti he
 The black hole can absorb a large amount of matter from its partner after formation
 atyadhik bade yogadan tab praapt hote hai jab ek blike hole kaa anya taron yaa compact vastuon se vilay hota he
 The supermassive black holes at the center of most galaxies may have been formed by the merger of many smaller objects
 isi prakriya ko kuch madhyavarti drabyaman vaale blike holon ke nirmaan ke liye bhi prastaavit kiya gaya he
 As an object moves towards the event horizon, the horizon begins to swell and swallow it
 iske sheeghra baad trigya kaa vistaar puure hole main samaan rup se vitarit ho jaataa he
 In 1974, Stephen Hawking showed that black holes are not completely black, but they also emit small amounts of thermal radiation
 unhen yah parinaam mila ek sthir blike hole prishthbhumi main pramaatra kshetra siddhant kaa prayog karke
 The result of their equations is that a black hole must leave particles in an ideal black body spectrum
 yah prabhaav hawking vikiran ke rup main janaa gaya
 Since the Hawking result, many have verified this effect through various methods
 yadi blike hole vikiran kaa yah siddhant sahi he, to aisi apeksha kii jaati he ki blike hole vikiran ke tapiya kiranpunj ko nikaalenge or isse drabyaman kaa kshay hoga, kyonki saapekshata siddhant ke anusaar drabyaman ucch sanghanit urja maatr he 
 samay ke saath blike hole sikud kar hawa main ud jaayenge
 The temperature of this beam remains proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole, which in turn is inversely proportional to mass
 isliye bade blike hole chote blike hole se kam vikiran chhodte hai
 The Hawking temperature of a stellar black hole with 5 solar masses is about 12 nanokelvins
 yah antarikshawya sookshm-tarang prishthbhumi dwaara utpaadit 2
7K se kaaphi kam he
 Black holes with stellar mass gain more mass than they emit through Hawking radiation from the cosmic microwave background, so they spread rather than shrink
 2
7 k se adhik hawking taapmaana praapt karne ke liye, ek blike hole ko chandramaa se bhi halkaa hona padegaa 
 On the other hand if a black hole is very small, it is expected that its radiation effect will be very powerful
 ek blike hole jo manushyon kii tulana main bhi baari he, kshan main lupt ho jaayegaa
 a black hole weighing a car will take only one nanosecond to evaporate, during which time its brightness will exceed 200 times that of the sun
 halke blike hole se ummid kii jaati he ki ve or bhi teji se vashpit ho jaayenge, udhaaharan ke liye 1 tev / c 2 drabyaman vaala ek blike hole puri tarah lupt hone main 10−88 second se bhi kam samay lagayegaa
 Of course, for such a small black hole the quantum gravity effect is expected to play an important role and even - although recent developments in quantum gravity provide no clue to it - hypothetically such small black holes are stable Will be adhikansh abhivruddhi discs tathaa gas jet kii maujuudagi taarakeey drabyaman vaale blike hole kii upasthiti kaa spasht saboot nahin he, kyonki neutron taare or safed bunon jaisi anya adhik drabyaman vaali or ati ghani vasteen abhivruddhi discon or gas dhaaraon ke nirmaan kaa kaaran ho sakati hai or unka vyavhaar vaisaa hi hota he jaisaa blike hole ke irdagird hota he
 But they can often help astronomers by telling them where the search for a black hole can prove to be fruitful
 magar duusari taraf, ati vishaal abhivruddhi discs or gas dharaaen atyadhik drabyaman vaale blike hole kii upasthiti kaa acha saboot ho sakati hai, kyonki jahaan tak ham jaanate hai keval ek blike hole hi in ghatnaon kii utpatti kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Static X-rays and gamma ray emissions also do not prove the presence of a black hole, but can tell astronomers where to search would be fruitful - and they have the advantage of being able to easily detect clouds of gas and gas Get out lekin shaktishaalee, aniyamit eks-re, gamma kirane or anya vidyut-chumbakeey vikiran yah sabit karne main madad kar sakate hai ki vah vishaal, ati ghani vastu ek blike hole nahin he, taaki "blike hole akhetak" kisi anya vastu kii taraf dhyaan kendrit kar saken
 Neutron stars and other very dense wires have surfaces and the collision with the surface at a high percentage of the speed of light emits intense flames of radiation at irregular intervals
 blike hole main koi thos sataha nahin hoti he, isliye kisi atyadhik drabyaman vaali ati saghan vastu ke irdagird aniyamit antaraal par vikiran kii gahan lapaton kaa abhaav, yah darshata he ki vahaan ek blike hole ke milane kii acchhee sambhaavna ho sakati he
 The intense but single-handed release of the gamma ray may indicate the birth of a "new" black hole, as astrophysicists think that the cause of grbs is either the gravitational collapse of a massive star or a collision between neutron stars, And both these events involve enough mass and pressure to create a black hole
 lekin aisa prathit hota he ki ek neutron taare or ek blike hole ke bich kaa takaraav bhi ek GRB paidaa kar saktaa he, isliye ek GRB saboot nahin he ki ek "nae" blike hole kaa gathan hua he
 All known grbs come from outside our own galaxy and most come from billions of light years away, so the black holes associated with them are actually billions of years old
 kuch antariksh-bhautikavidon kaa vishwaas he ki kuch ati chamkile eks-re strot madhyavarti-drabyaman vaale blike hole ke abhivruddhi discs ho sakate hai
 Kasars are believed to be the accretion disks of a highly massaging black hole, as no known object is so powerful that it can emit so powerful
 qasaar puure vidyut-chumbakeey spectrum main shaktishaalee utsarjan utpann karte hai, jisamen shaamil hai yuvi, eks-re or gamma-kiran or apni ucch chamak ke kaaran ye kaaphi duuri se bhi dikhaai dete hai
 Between 5 and 25 percent of the quasars are "radio loud", a noun due to their powerful radio emission
 ek gurutveey lens kaa nirmaan tab hota he jab kisi bahut dur sthit ujjwal strot se aati hui prakaash kii kirane kisi vishalkay vastu ke aasapaas "mud" jaati hai, darshak or strot vastu ke bich
 is prakriya ko gurutveey lencing ke rup main janaa jaataa he or yah saamaanya saapekshata siddhant kii bhavishyavaaniyon main se ek he
 According to this theory, space "time" assimilates to create mass gravitational fields and therefore bend light as a result
 lens ke peeche ke strot kii chhavi ek paryvekshak ko kai chhaviyon ke rup main dikhaai pad sakati he
 If the source, the heavy lensing object and the observer are in a straight line, the source will appear as a ring behind the heavy object
 gurutveey lencing blike hole ke alaava anya vastuon ke kaaran bhi ho saktaa he, kyonki koi bhi ati shaktishaalee gurutvkarshan kshetra prakaash kirnon ko modane kii kshamta rakhata he
 Some of these multi-image effects are probably caused by remotely located galaxies
 blike hole kii parikrama karti vasteen, kendriya vastu ke aasapaas ke gurutvkarshan kshetra kaa anveshan karti rahati hai
 An older example, discovered in the 1970s, is the accretion disk orbiting around the fictitious black hole responsible for Cygnus X-1, a well-known X-ray source
 haalaanki swayan padaarth ko to sidhe taur par nahin dekha ja saktaa, eksre kii timatimaahat mili secondon main jari rahati he, jaisaa ki lagbhag das saura drabyaman vaale ek blike hole ke chaaron ore parikrama karne vaale kisi garm pind rupi padaarth se abhivruddhi se thik pehle ummid kii jaati he
 The x-ray spectrum represents the specific shape that is expected from a disc containing orbiting relativistic materials, with an iron line emitted at ~ 6
4 kev, and widened to red and blue
 ek anya udhaaharan he S2 tara jise akashgangeey centre kii parikrama karte dekha jaataa he
 This star is several light hours away from a black hole with a ~ 3
5 × 106 solar mass, so its rotation speed can be noted
 paryvekshit kaksha ke centre main kuch bhi dikhaai nahin detaa he, jaisaa ki ek kaali vastu se ummid kii jaati he
 Semi-periodic oscillations can be used to determine the mass of a black hole
 yah takanic blike hole or uske aasapaas kii discon ke bhitari bhaag ke bich ke sambandh kaa upyog karti he, jahaan gas ghatana kshitij tak pahunchne se pehle bheetar kii ore ghumaavdaar rup main aati rahati he
 As the gas collapses inward, it transmits x-ray radiation whose intensity is less than a certain order and which repeats itself at a regular interval
 yah sanketak ardh-aavadhik dolan yaa QPO kehalaata he
 The frequency of a QPO depends on the mass of the black hole; The smaller black hole has an event horizon located close to it, so the QPO has a higher frequency
 adhik dravyaman vaale blike hole ke liye, ghatana kshitij kaaphi aage baahar kii ore hota he, isliye QPO aavriti kam hoti he
 It is now widely accepted that every galaxy, or nearly every one, has a supermassive black hole at its center
 is blike hole ke dravyaman or mejabaan akashganga ke ubhaar ke bich jo najdiki sahasambandh he, vah yah darshata he ki akashganga or blike hole ke nirmaan ke bich kaaphi gaharaa sambandh he
 For decades, astronomers used the term "active galaxy" to describe galaxies that had unusual characteristics, such as unusual spectral line emission and super-powerful radio emission
 haalanki, saidhantik or paryvekshaniya adhyayan dikhaate hai ki in akashgangaon ke sakriy gangey nabhik main ati vishalkay blike hole ho sakate hai
 These AGN models have a central black hole that may be millions or billions of times heavier than the sun; a gas and dust disk called accretion disk; And two currents that are perpendicular to the accretion disk
 haalaanki, ummid kii jaati he ki ati vishalkay blike hole lagbhag sabhi AGN main paae jaayenge, sirf kuch hi akashgangaon ke nabhikon kaa dhyaan purvak adhyayan kiya gaya he is prayaas main ki centrestha ati vishalkay blike hole ummidavaaron kii pahchaan or vaastavik dravyaman kii maap, donon kii ja sake
 Examples of such notable galaxies are the Andromeda galaxy, M32, M87, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC 4258, and the Sombrero galaxy
 khagolavidon kaa vishwaas he ki hamaari apni akashganga ke centre main ek ati vishalkay blike hole sthit he, segitarius A* naamak kshetra main, kyonki: In 2002, observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope indicate that there are likely to be intermediate-mass black holes in spherical clusters called M15 and G1
 yah vyakhya golakaar samoohon main taron ke kaksha ke aakaar or avadhi par aadhaarit he
 But the Habbal proof is not conclusive, because a group of neutron stars can be the reason for such observations
 haal kii khojon tak, kai khagolvid sochate the ki golakaar samoohon main jatil gurutvkarshan antah-kriyaayen nae bane blike holon ko nishkasit kar dengi
 In November 2004, a team of astronomers reported the discovery of the first and fully verified intermediate-mass black hole of our galaxy, orbiting 3 light years away from Segitarius a *
 1300 saura dravyaman vaala yah blike hole saat taron ke ek samooh ke bich main he, sambhawatah yah ek vishaal tara samooh kaa avshesh he jo akaash ganga ke centre se chhitak gaya he
 This observation confirms that supermassive black holes grow by absorption of nearby small black holes and stars
 janvari 2007 main, united kingdom ke southempton vishvavidhyalay main shodhakartaaon ne ek blike hole kii khoj kii soochna di, yah sambhawatah 10 saura dravyamanon waal tha or NGC 4472 naamak ek akashganga main sthit tha, lagbhag 5

 Our galaxy contains many possible stellar-mass black holes, which are closer to us than the supermassive black holes in the Sagittarian a * region
 ye sabhi ummidavaar eks-re dwiadhari pranaaliyon ke sadsy hai jisamen adhik ghani vastu apane saathi se ek abhivruddhi discs ke madhyam se padaarthon ko apni ore khinchati he
 The black holes in these pairs can range from three to more than a dozen solar masses
 ab tak awalokit taarakeey dravyaman vaale blike holon main durtam, mesiye 33 akashganga main sthit dwiadhari pranali kaa sadsy he
 Theoretically there is no minimum size for a black hole
 ek baar inaki rachana ho jane par, inamen blike hole ke gun aa jate hai
 Stephen Hawking proposed that supermassive black holes can evaporate and become more microscopic, that is, micro black holes
 vashpit hote atiprarambhik blike hole kii khoj hetu fermi gamma-re spes telescope ko prastaavit kiya ja rahaa he, jiskaa prakshepan 11 june 2008 ko kiya gaya tha
 However, if microscopic black holes can be formed in other ways, such as by the impact of space rays or in colliders, this does not mean that they must certainly evaporate
 dharti par kan twarakon main blike hole ke anuroopon kaa nirmaan hone kii soochna he
 These black holes are not the same as the corresponding gravitational black holes, but they are important for examining the principles of gravity quantification
 ve majboot nabhikeey shakti ke siddhant ke anuroop hone kii vajah se blike hole kii tarah vyavhaar karte hai, jinka gurutvkarshan or gurutvkarshan ke pramaatra siddhant se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 They are similar because both are described by string theory
 atah quark gluon plasma main aag ke gole ke gathan or vighatan kii vyakhya blike hole kii bhashaa main kii ja sakati he
 The fireball phenomenon in the relativistic heavy ion collider is very close to that of a black hole, and many of its physical properties can be predicted correctly using this analog
 aag kaa gola, haalaanki, ek gurutveey vastu nahin he
 It is not currently known whether a more energetic Large Hadron Collider will be capable of producing larger black holes with larger extra dimensions than expected , as suggested by several researchers
 adhik gaharaai se charchaa ke liye dekhen: large hadran colider main kan takaraav kii suraksha
 General relativity describes the possibility of a configuration in which two black holes are connected to each other
 is tarah ke vinyas ko aamtaur par ek varmhole kaha jaataa he
 Wormholes have inspired writers of fictional science fiction because they provide a means to quickly travel long distances, including time travel
 vyavhaar main, khagol bhautikee main aise vinyas lagbhag asambhav si baat hai, kyonki koi bhi gyaat prakriya in vastuon ke nirmaan kii anumati detii prathit nahin hoti he
 In 1971, Stephen Hawking showed that the total area of the event horizon of any collection of traditional black holes cannot be reduced even if they collide and swallow each other, that is, merge
 yah ullekhneey rup se ushmpravagiki ke dwitiya niyam ke samaan he, jahaan kshetra entropy kii bhoomika adaa karata he
 It was believed that the black hole entropy would be zero because of the zero temperature
 yadi aisa hota to entropy-krit padaarth ke blike hole main pravesh se ushmpravagiki ke duusare niyam kaa ulanghan hota tha, parinamswaroop brahmad kii kul entropy main kami aani chahie thi
 Therefore, Jacob Beckenstein proposed that a black hole needs an entropy and it should be proportional to the event horizon
 chunki blike hole paaramparik rup se vikiran nahin chhodte he, ushmpravagiki drushtikon ek anuroop maatr prathit hota he, kyonki shunya taapmaana kaa arth he ooshmaa ke kisi bhi yoga se entropy main anant parivartanon kaa hona, jiskaa arth he anant entropy
 However, in 1974, Hawking applied quantum field theory to curved space-time near the event horizon and found that black holes emit Hawking radiation, which is a kind of thermal radiation and is associated with the impact, which implies that That they have a positive temperature
 isane blike hole gatishiltaa or ushmpravagiki ke bich ke anurupan ko bal pradaan kiya: blike hole yantriki ke pehle niyam kaa upyog karte hue, yah nishkarsh niklaa ja saktaa he ki ek gaiyr-chakrit blike hole kii entropy uske ghatana kshitij ke kshetra kii ek chauthai hogi
 This is a universal consequence and can be applied to the entire cosmic horizon, such as in the De Sittar space field
 baad main yah suzav aayaa ki ek blike hole adhiktam entropy vaali vastu he, arthath antariksh ke kisi ek kshetra kii adhiktam sambhav entropy us kshetra main samaa sakane vaale sabase bade blike hole kii entropy hogi
 This led to the creation of holographic theory
 hawking vikiran blike hole ke vishisht taapmaana ko darshata he, jisaki gananaa uski entropy se kii ja sakati he
 The higher the temperature falls, the more massive the black hole becomes: the more energy it absorbs, the more cold it becomes
 budh grah ke lagbhag dravyaman vaale blike hole main akashiya sookshm-tarang vikiran ke santulan main taapmaana hota he 
 When heavier than this, a black hole will be cooler than background radiation and it will receive energy from the background much faster than the energy emitted through Hawking radiation, it will also cool down
 haalaanki, ek kam baari blike hole main yah prabhaav yah darshaayegaa ki blike hole kaa dravyaman samay ke saath dhire dhire vashpit ho kar ud jaayegaa, jabaki blike hole aisa karte hue or adhik garam hota jaayegaa
 While these effects are negligible for black holes that are sufficiently heavy to be formed internally, they will become increasingly important for imaginary small black holes, where quantum-mechanical effects dominate
 vastav main, chote blike hole sambhawatah drut gati se vashpit honge or antat vikiran ke ek visphot ke saath lupt ho jaayenge
 Although general relativity can be used to calculate the entropy of a black hole, this condition is in principle not satisfactory
 sankhyikeey yantriki main, entropy kaa arth ek pranali kii sookshm vinyas kii sankhya kii gananaa ke rup main samajha jaataa he jinamein samaan sookshm gun ho 
 But without a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity, such a calculation is not possible for a black hole
 haalaanki, string siddhant dwaara thodi aashaa jagaai gayi he, jiske anusaar blike hole kii swatantraaa kii sookshm maatra D-breance he
 By calculating the states of D-branes by the charge and energy provided, the entropy measurements of some particularly highly symmetric black holes can be obtained
 in gananaaon kii vaidhata ke kshetra ko vistrut karnaa, anusandhanon ke liye ek jari kaary kshetra he
 The so-called information loss paradox, or black hole centralization paradox, is an open question in fundamental physics
 paaramparik rup se, bhautik vigyaan ke niyam samaan hi rahenge, aage kii taraf badhen yaa peeche jaaen 
 That is, if the position and velocity of each particle of the universe is measured, we can work backwards to discover the history of the past universe at will
 luvil prameya fez spes volum ke sangrakshan kaa varnan karata he, jise "jaankaree ke sangrakshan" ke rup main samajha ja saktaa he, isliye sthapit bhautikee main bhi kuch samasya avashya he
 In quantum mechanics, this coincides with an important property called centralization, which is concerned with the conservation of probability
 haalaanki, blike hole is niyam kaa ulanghan kar sakate hai
 Under the established general relativity, this situation is subtle but clear: due to the established no-hair theorem, it can never be determined what went inside the black hole? However, when viewed from the outside, the information is never actually destroyed, as matter falling into a black hole takes infinite time to reach the event horizon
 is baat par jor dena aavashyak he ki saamaanya saapekshata ke sameekaran asal main tii-samarupata kaa paalan karte hai or yah tathy ki uparokt tark saamaanya saapekshata ke aplicoshan se hi aata he, hamen thodaa satark ho janaa chahie
 This is due to the fact that it is not possible by time-symmetric theory to reach time-reversal-asymmetric conclusions, which in this case is general relativity

 However, on 21 July 2004, he introduced a new argument, contrary to his previous argument
 is nai gananaa main, blike hole se sambandhit utkram maap nikalakar hawking vikiran main hi jaataa he
 However, it is also difficult to understand in theory until the black hole completes its evaporation
 tab tak hawking vikiran kii jaankaree or vyavastha kii praarambhik avasthaa main 1:1 tareeke se sambhddha sthapit karnaa asambhav he
 Once the black holes evaporate completely, they can be identified and the centralization in them is preserved
 jis samay hawking ne apni gananaa puri kii, yah ads / CFT sambandh ke dwaara kaaphi spasht ho chukaa tha ki blike hole kaa kshay ekaatmak tareeke se hota he

 But Hawking himself expressed enough confidence in it to pay for a bet he had made in 1997 with Caltech physicist John Preskill, which the media was interested in

 They believe in this because this black hole can solve the information-loss paradox

 vah prayek vachan athwa qaraar jo kanoon dwaara pravartaneey ho athwa jiskaa kanoon dwaara paalan karaayaa ja sake, sanvida kehalaata he
 The current contract is characterized by its legal validity
 vachanpaalan, qaraar athwa kaul ke nirvaah ko sampoorn vishwa main or visheshat: bharat main bada mahatv diya gaya he
 The story of Dasharatha, the son of exile and self-demise of a son for pledge in Indian history, is popular

 The legal history of Rome is interesting in this regard from a commercial and legal point of view
 vahaan sanvida kaa pracheenatam swaroop tha
 In its original form, this lending was related to merchandise
 dhire dhire rin ke liye bhi iskaa prayog hone laga
 It had certain formalities without which perfection would not have been attained
 bharat main bhi naarad or brihaspati ke granthon main vastuvikray, rin, saajhedaari or abhikartrutv ke sambandhon kaa ullekh he
 But the nature of the present contract is different from that, although the link of its development can also be linked to them
 vartmaan sanvida kii visheshta uski kanoonee manyata he
 Every promise or agreement which is enforceable by law or which can be upheld by law is a contract
 pracheen kaal main is kanoonee manyata par vishesh bal nahin tha balki bal tha uski aupchaarikaataaon main se yadi koi aupchaarikta kam rah jaati thi to sanvida purna nahin hoti thi
 Although the practice of contract in its various forms was in the business relations of the society, the term "contract" was discovered much later
 sanvida shabd bahut vyapak he
 Parts of the contract itself are sale, loan, mortgage, deposit, partnership, motherhood, marriage etc
 parantu apane vartmaan rup main sanvida ne nayaa kanoonee arth grahan kar liya he
 In India, its act was made in 1872 AD and contracts are regulated by the same Indian Contract Act
 isaliye bhartiya nyaayalay ab sanvida ke maamle main isi likhit kanoon kaa anusaran karne ko baadhya hai
 For the interpretation of the law, they should study this act and find suitable meaning and purpose
 bhartiya sanvida adhinium british sanvida kanoon par aadhaarit he parantu british sanvida adhinium kii sahaayta tabhi lee ja sakati he jab yaa to bhartiya sanvida adhinium kisi prashn par maun ho athwa uski vyavastha aspasht ho or british kanoon bhartiya avasthaa or saamaajik sthiti se asangat na ho
 a contract in its present form is a legal promise or an enforceable agreement by law
 isamen do aavashyak tatv hai - Agreement and kanoon dwaara use prabhaavasheel banaae jane kaa gun
 When at least two people are unanimous in relation to doing or abstaining from something, then it is called agreement
 qaraar ke liye kam se kam do pakshon kaa hona aavashyak he
 If "A" proposed to "B" that "B" make a picture of "A", he would give "B" five hundred rupees for this work
 "a" ke dwaara yah prastaav he
 If "B" accepts that he will make a picture for "A" in five solar rupees, then it is an agreement that is enforceable by law and can be made effective
 arthath ek vyakti akelaa hi koi qaraar nahin kar saktaa he qaraar ke liye qaraar sambandhi baton par ubhay paksh kii maansik ekaatmata hona aavashyak he
 This means that in relation to everything related to the agreement, the common parties understand the same meaning
 aisa na ho ki ek paksh ek arth or doosraa paksh doosraa arth samajhe
 "A" has two motorcars, one Ford and the other Chevrolet
 vah apni ford car paanch hajaar main bechnaa chahta he
 He offered to sell that car with "B"
 parantu "ba" ne "shevarlyt" car samajhakar use kharidne kii sweekruti pradaan kar di
 This agreement will not happen because "A" and "B" did not result in mental monotony in relation to the motorcar
 motorcar se "a" ne ford motorcar or "ba" ne shevarlyt car samajhi
 It is clear from the above statement that the proposal becomes an agreement only after acceptance
 prastaav vibhinn prakaar ke hote hai parantu saadhaarant: unka vargeekaran paanch shreniyon main kiya gaya he : 1
 Specific proposal, when a proposal is made to a certain person or persons, it is called a specific proposal
 chunki prastaav nishchit vyakti yaa vyaktiyon se kiya jaataa he, at: isamen sweekaar karanevaala vyakti, jise swikarta kaha jayega, nirdisht hota he
 In this, the acceptance notice must be given by the acceptor to the proposer
 2
 saamaanya prastaav vah prastaav he jo nishchit vyakti yaa vyaktiyon se nahin kiya jaataa balki sansar kaa koi vyakti ise sweekaar kar saktaa he
 That is why, like a specific proposal, it is not mandatory to give the information of acceptance to the proposer
 prastaav main prakatit or icchit kaary ko karnaa hi is prastaav kii sweekruti maani gai he
 3
 Explicit proposals are those proposals which are made in verbal or written form but clearly
 4
 sankethik prastaav ye prastaav shabdon dwaara na hokar kaary dwaara kiye jate hai
 There is a proposal to take passengers from one place to another in lieu of tickets, the train has to come to the station
 yah saamaanya prastaav kaa bhi udaarahan he kyonki iskaa swikarta purvanishchit nahin he
 5
 Continuous proposal In this proposal, a proposal to supply 5000 mana of wheat at a fixed rate
 is prastaav kii sweekruti ke uparant bhi ek paksh turant hi sampoorn gehun kharidne ko yaa doosraa paksh bechney ko baadhya nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Like the proposal and according to it determines a particular method or system of acceptance, there determines that method or system of acceptance, if there is no acceptance by that method or system of acceptance, then the proposer is forced to accept by that system Should give
 parantu jahaan sweekruti kii kisi pranali yaa vishisht vidhi kaa ullekh nahin ho, vahaan kisi yuktiyukt, sangat or uchit pranali dwaara sweekruti di ja sakati he
 Acceptance can also be explicitly by words or by act in symbolic form
 tikat lekar gantavy sthaan ko janevaali railgadee par yatri kaa baithna hi kaary dwaara company ke prastaav kii sweekruti he
 Mental acceptance alone cannot be considered acceptance
 shabdon main athwa kaary dwaara uski abhivyakti bhi aavashyak he
 Performing the tasks specified in the proposal is also considered acceptance of certain proposals
 parantu yah aavashyak he ki swikarta is kaary ko karne ke purv se hi prastaavak kii sharte jaanata ho
 If the acceptor performs the work specified in the offer without the knowledge of the offer, it cannot be considered acceptance of the offer
 ek vyakti goridutt ne apane bhattije kii khoj ke liye apane munim lalman ko bheja
 After Lalman's departure, Gauridutt announced a 501 rupee award for his nephew
 lalman munim gauridatt ke bhattije ko khoj laayaa or puraskaar kii maang kii
 The decision was made that since Lalman was not informed of the condition of the award before the search of the boy, nor was it known to receive the award, Lalman's task of finding the lost boy could not be considered acceptance of Gauridutt's proposal
 prastaav se utpann laabh ko sweekaar karnaa bhi upyukt dashaon main prastaav kii sweekruti samajhi jaati he
 Sitting in a bus from Varanasi to Prayag is acceptance of the offer of the bus owner and the acceptor is obliged to pay the bus fare
 sweekruti prastaav ke kaayam rahane kii dasha main honi chahie
 If the proposal has been nullified or has been rejected or withdrawn by the proposer, acceptance will also be null and void
 prastaavak kii soochna swikarta ko or prastaav kii sweekruti kii soochna prastaavak ko milanaa aavashyak he
 When the information of the proposal is received by the person to whom the proposal is made, then the convection or communication of the proposal is deemed complete
 "k" ne apni ghadi 150) main "kha" ko bechney kaa prastaav patr dwaara "kha" kii preshit kiya
 As soon as the letter "B" is received, the offer for "A" will be completed
 sweekrurta ke liye pruthak pruthak hota he
 When the acceptor sends his acceptance to the proposer in such a way that his withdrawal is not in the hands of the acceptor, the acceptance against the proposer reaches the proposer
 uparyukt udhaaharan main "kha" dwaara apni sweekruti kaa sanvahan purna samajha jayega parantu swikarta ke viruddh nahin
 Convection of acceptance against acceptance against the acceptor will be complete when the acceptance reaches the proposer
 uparyukt udhaaharan main "kha" dwaara apni sweekruti kaa patr "k" ke naam daalate hi sweekruti kii pabandi "k" naamak prastaavak ke viruddh ho jaaegi parantu swikarta "kha" ke viruddh nahin
 Completion of convection against "B" will occur when "A" receives its letter of acceptance
 jab prastaavak or swikarta ek duusare ke samaksh upasthit hon to sanvahan main koi pechidagi paidaa nahin hoti parantu jab donon do sthanon par hon to sanvahan kaa madhyam dak : patr yaa taar : hota he
 It is clear from the above statement that the letter of offer is not completed as soon as it is left by the proposer, but is completed only after reaching the acceptor
 isse yah bhi nishkarsh nikalataa he ki prastaavak or swikarta ek duusare ke samaksh upasthit hon to sanvahan main koi pechidagi paidaa nahin hoti parantu jab tak swikarta apni sweekruti kaa patr dak main nahin chhod detaa kyonki tab sweekruti kaa waapas liya janaa swikarta ke vash ke baahar ho jaataa he
 Every offer left by the acceptor in the mail is completed against the proposer
 upar kaha ja chukaa he ki sweekruti swikarta ke viruddh tab purna hoti he jab prastaavak ko praapt ho jaae
 Acceptors leave their acceptance letters in the post office before the proposer receives them, against the acceptor is also completed
 sweekrutapatr der main pahunchne yaa raste main kho jane par bhi prabhavakaari rahata he kyonki aisa mana gaya he ki dak vibhaag kii asaavadhaanee yaa bhul kaa koi prabhaav sanvida ke pakshon par padana nyaaysangat nahin he
 But if the letter for convection is not given in the post to the postman, then it is not enough convection because it is not included in the duties of the postman to leave every person's letter in the post

 It has also been clarified in this section that the above definition will not affect any such law, jiske dwaara kisi sanvida kaa likhit, yaa panjikrut sakshiyon kii gavaahi ke saath hona aavashyak he
 All such persons are considered to be contractual, who are adult, healthy minded and are not disqualified by any law

 bhrant kathan, yaa bhranti dwaara prabhavit nahin hui ho or na praapt kii gai ho
 The definition of force or tragedy is given in the Indian Contract Act
 uske anusaar balpravartan yaa traas ke chaar rup he : Performing acts punishable and punishable by the Indian Penal Law or karne kii dhamkee dena, chaahe us sthaan par jahaan yah kaary kiya jaae bhartiya dand vidhaan lagu ho yaa nahin, Unlawfully withholding the property of any person; Or roak rakhane kii dhamkee dena
 The purpose of this force or tragedy should be to make someone a party to the contract
 avaanchit prabhaav kii paribhaasha sanvida adhinium kii dhara 16 main di gai he
 According to him, the contract is said to be motivated by undue influence whose relations of the parties are such that one party uses that particular position with the will of the other party
 mata pita or bachche, abhibhavak or palya, vakil ore muvakkil, doctor or rogi, guru or shishy aadi ke sambandh aise hi hote hai jinamein pratham paksh duusare kii ichchhaaon ko apane vishisht sambandh ke kaaran prerit karata he
 In order to prove undue influence, it is also necessary to prove that in fact, on the other side of the party of special status, used its special position for its unfair advantage
 yadi yah baat siddh nahin hoti to keval vishisht sthiti ke hi kaaran koi sanvida avaanchit prabhaav dwaara prabhavit yaa parityajya nahin samajhi jaaegi
 This is described in Section 17 of the Contract Act
 uske anusaar sanvida ke kisi paksh dwaara yaa uski sajeesh se yaa uske abhikarta dwaara duusare paksh yaa uske abhikarta ko dhokhaa dene yaa chhalane yaa sanvida se sammilit hone ke liye prerit karne ke hetu nimnaankit kaary chhalkapat kehalaayenge : A) to tell the facts, which he does not believe in the truth, kha) aise tathy ko chhipaana jiskaa use gyaan yaa vishwaas na ho; C) to give a promise that does not wish to be fulfilled; gha) aisa kaary karnaa yaa usase virat hona jise kanoon vishesh rup se chhalkapat ghoshit karata ho; 4) To do other deceptive tasks
 qaraar ke sambandh main vichaar karte hue yah kaha gaya he ki ubhay paksh ke bich maansik mataiky kaa hona aavashyak he
 The fallacy is related to this
 isamen ek paksh ek vastu yaa baat or doosraa paksh duusari vastu yaa baat samajhataa he
 As a result, the contract seems to be seen in the upper way, but there is virtually no contract due to confusion
 ye bhrantiyaan kai prakaar kii hotin hai
 An example of confusion regarding content is given by Chevrolet and Ford Motor Cars in the pre-section
 isi prakaar sanvida ke paksh kii pahchaan main bhi bhranti sambhav he
 "A" contracted as "B", if it was in fact "B" and not "C", then it is a misconception of the identity of the party
 sanvida kii prakruti yaa arth sambandhi bhi bhranti ho sakati he
 If one of the later parties signs an agreement on the other party stating the application for taking the opportunity later, then the other party gets confused about the form or nature of the contract
 aisi dasha main hastakshar banaanevaale kaa mastishk uske hastakshar ke saath nahin he
 Yield is an essential element for covenant
 bina pratifal ke koi prasanvida nahin ho sakati; or yadi vah ho bhi to ni:satv yaa avaidh hoti he
 The return must also be valid
 udhaaharan swaroop "a", "ba" ko "sa" kii hatya ke liye 5000 ru
 detaa he or "ba" hatya ke liye vachan detaa he
 Here this contract is free because its reward is forbidden by murder law
 is prakaar nimnlikhit prakaar ke pratifal avaidh hote hai - 1
 The returns which are forbidden by law
 yadi koi pratifal spashtyaa yaa sankethik rup se kanoon dwaara varjit ho to uske aadhaar par nirmit prasanvida ni:satya hoti he
 This will become clear from the above example
 2
 yadi koi aisa pratifal ho jisase kisi adhinium kii koi vyavastha bhang hoti ho yaa nishphal hoti ho to vah pratifal avaidh mana jayega
 3
 Those returns which are fraudulent are considered illegal
 4
 vah pratifal jiske dwaara kisi vyakti ke sharir yaa sampatti ko haani pahunchati ho avaidh hota he
 For example, a promises to pay five hundred rupees to the editor of a newspaper if the offending details about Editor b are printed
 yahan pratifal avaidh he kyonki isse ba kii pratishtha par aghat pahunchataa he
 5
 Returns that are immoral are illegal
 6
 lokaneeti ke viruddh pratifal avaidh hote hai, jaise shatru ke saath vyapaar karnaa
 Contracts tending to cause harm to public service, contracts strangling lawsuits related to punishable offenses are disqualified
 vaidhanik karrwai kaa durupyog karne kii pravriti rakhanevaali sanvida, aisi sanvida jau naitikta ke viruddh ho, yaa vyaparnirodhak sanvida yaa kisi jo naitikta ke viruddh ho, yaa vyaparnirodhak sanvida yaa kisi vyavask vyakti ko shaadi karne se rokane ke liye sanvida, ityadi bhi lokaneeti ke viruddh evam ni:satv hotin hai
 The invalidation of even one of the aims and rewards makes the contract null
 yadi sanvida kaa uddeshy anshat: avaidh ho tab bhi sanvida ni:satv ho jaati he, yadi uske avaidh ansh ko vaid ansh se pruthak na kiya ja sake
 If the illegal share of the consideration or purpose can be separated from the valid portion, then the valid portion will be enforceable and the invalid share will be disqualified
 jaise "ba" ne "a" ko ek pratigyapaatr dwaara 2000 rupye dene kaa vachan diya jinamein se 1500 rupye purana rin tha or 500 rupye jue main haari rakam thi
 In this, the legitimate part can be separated from the illegal part; Therefore, this covenant will be valid for 1500 rupees, but 500) will be disqualified
 bhartiya sanvida adhinium ke antargat ni:satv ghoshit qaraar kanoon dwaara pravartaneey nahin ho sakate, yadhyapi usamen sanvida ke anya tatv purnat: vidyaman bhi hon

 It is not necessary for all agreements and contracts to be written, registered and with the testimony of witnesses, but such a contract, despite all other properties, is not valid due to lack of these formalities
 uparyukt varnan se sanvida-nirmaan ke aavashyak tatwon kaa saar nimnlikhit prathit hota he : 1
 having at least two sides; 2
