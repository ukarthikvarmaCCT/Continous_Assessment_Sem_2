 France's state revolution in 1789 AD affected Europe's life on a deeper level by propagating the spirit of freedom, equality and brotherhood
 roosi kranti kii vyapaktaa ab tak kii sabhi raajnneetik ghatnaon kii tulana main bahut vistrut thi

 Just as the most important event in the history of the 18th century is the State Revolution of France, similarly the most important event of the twentieth century was the Bolshevik Revolution of Russia in 1917 AD
 rus main saamaajik samanta kaa nitant abhaav tha
 At this time, the entire society of Russia was divided into three different categories, in which there was no goodwill among themselves
 ve ek duusare ko apane se purnataya bhinn or pruthak samajhati thim
 Czar Nicholas was an absolute autocratic and autocratic ruler
 yah janata ko kisi prakaar kaa adhikaar pradaan karne ke paksh main nahin tha
 The following reasons of the Russian Revolution of 1917 were- anya deshon ke samaan rus main bhi audyogic kranti hui, yadhyapi yahaan par kranti anya deshon kii apeksha kaaphi samay ke uparaant hui kintu iske hone par rus main bahut se kaarkaanon kii sthapana ho gai thi
 Thus began the industrialization of Russia
 isamen kaam karne ke kaaran lakhon kii sankhya main majdoor dehaton or gaanvon kaa parityag kar un nagaron tathaa shaharon main nivas karne lage, jinamein kal kaarkaanon kii sthapana hui thi
 Due to residing in cities and cities, they were no longer as simple as before
 nagaron main rahane se unamem na keval chalata-poorjaapan hi aa gaya tha, apitu ye raajnneetik maamalon main bhi ruchi lene lage the
 He also took note of his political and social rights
 inhone apane klbon kaa nirmaan kiya, jahaan ye sab prakaar ke maamalon par vichaar karte the or aapas main vaad-vivaad karte the
 He also got knowledge of new ideologies and trends by staying here
 inhone shramik sanghathanon kii sthapana bhi kerani aarambhn There was a revolution in Russia in 1905, by which an attempt was made to establish a legal monarchy in Russia, but due to mutual quarrels, this revolution could not succeed and the rule was re-established
 is kranti kaa spasht parinaam yah hua ki usne rus kii saadhaaran janata ko raajnneetik adhikaron kaa parichay kara diya tha
 He came to know what the meaning of the vote is? How should members of Parliament be elected in Duma or in other words? The government should decide its policy according to the public opinion and move forward to do the works of public interest
 apane raajnneetik adhikaron se parichit ho jane ke kaaran rus kii janata samaj gai ki rus main bhi purnataya loktantr shashan kii sthapana honi chaiye jahaan saadhaaran janata ke haath main shashan satta ho
 The democracy states of Western Europe also had an impact on Russia, although the emperors of Russia made special efforts to stop the propagation of Western progressive ideas in Russia, but it is very difficult to stop the ideas, because ideas are like air
 
 pratham vishwayuddh ke samay germany or uske saathiyon ke viruddh jo prachaar-kaary mitra rashtron kii ore se kiya ja rahaa tha, usamen mukhyatah yahi kaha jaataa tha ki ve loktantr shashan, janata kii swatantraaa or rashtriyata ke aadhaar par naveen rashtron kaa nirmaan karne ke abhipraay se yuddh kar rahe hai
 Russia was under the Allies
 atah vahaan kii janata par bhi is prachaar kaa bahut asar padaa
 Education was promoted in Russian to middle-class individuals
 jis prakaar france kii kranti kaa shrey france ke darshanik, shikshit varg aadi ko praapt he usee prakaar rus main bhi kranti kaa veg isi shrenee ke logon ne teevr kiya

 Many Asian writers also presented new and progressive ideas through their texts
 shikshit varg par un naye vichaaron kaa bahut adhik prabhaav padaa, visheshtah navayuvak vidhyaarthee naye vichaaron kaa adhyayan kar yah bhalee-bhaanti samajhane lage the ki unka desh unnati kii daud main bahut pichhadaa hua he, jiskaa pramukh kaaran jaar kii nirankushta he
 a feeling was awakened in his heart that it is his duty to make great efforts to upgrade his country
 mahayuddh main rus mitra rashtron kii ore se sammilit hua
 His large army demonstrated great ability and competence at the start of the war, but after two years of continuous fighting, the signs of laxity were clearly visible in it
 rus kii sena bahadur avashya thi, kintu usamen desh-bhakthi or rashtriyata kii ve bhaavnaayen vidyaman nahin thi, jo apurv tyaag or mar mitane ke liye prerana pradaan karti hai
 Russian armies were recruited to meet the numbers
 unamem vir sainikon kii parampara avashya thi, par unke sammukh koi adarsh vishesh nahin tha
 This was the condition of Russia's bureaucracy
 rus ke karmchaaree yah nahin samajhate the ki ve desh kii unnati or raashtra seva ke liye niyukt kiye gayi hai
 His ideal was to please the emperor and occupy high positions
 jab vishwayuddh lambaa hota gaya or do varsh kii ladaai ke uparaant bhi vijay ke koi chinh prakat nahin hue to rus kii sena or naukarshahi ghabara uthi
 Bribery, corruption etc
 had already attained their climax in Russia
 garib logon ke liye guzar kar sakna asambhav ho gaya tha
 Finally, on 7 March 1917, the public's condition became very miserable
 uske paas na pahanane ko kapadaa tha or na khaane ko anaaj tha
 She was distraught with hunger and clothes
 pareshaan hokar bhukhe or thand se thithurate hue garib or majaburon ne 7 march din petrogred kii sadakon par ghoomana aarambh kiya
 Bread shops were piled with fresh and hot rotis
 bhukhi janata kaa man taaji or garam chaay va rotiyon ko dekhakar lalachaa gaya or vah apane aapako niyantran main nahin rakh saki
 They started looting in the market
 sarkaar ne sena ko un par goli chalaane kaa aadesh diya ki vah goli chalaakar luutmaar karne waalon ko teetar-bitar kar de, kintu sainikon ne goli chalaane se saaf manaa kar diya kyonki unako janata se sahanubhuti thi
 The spirit of revolution had entered them as well
 jab mazdooron ne yah dekha ki sainik un par goli chalaane ko taiyaar nahin hai, to unka saahas bahut bad gaya
 Hence, the revolution had become inevitable now
 duusari ore duma ne visarjeet hone se manaa kar diya
 It was compromised by the Petrograd Soviet, on the basis of which a social government was established on 14 March 1917 AD under the chairmanship of the liberal leader George Slavin
 usne 14 march ko jaar se shashan kaa parityag karne kii maang kii
 Bounded by the situation, he accepted his demand and resigned from the government
 is prakaar rus main jaarshahi kaa ant hua
 The workers were successful in the revolution, but they did not think it appropriate to keep the reins of governance in their hands, and handed over all the power to the middle class

 According to the treaty with Mu'awiya, after Mu'awiya's death, Hassan Alaihissalam would again be succeeded by his younger brother Hussein Alaheisslam Khalifa, but Mu'awiya did not like it either
 usne hossain alehisslam ko khilaafat dene se manaa kar diya
 Mu'awiya died the last 6 months before its ten-year term
 shart ke mutabik muavia kii koi santan khilaafat kii hakdaar nahin hogi, fir bhi usne apane bete ko yazid pratham khaliph bana diya or imam hossain alehisslam se beyat maagane laga jis par hossain alehisslam ne kaha "mere jesa tujh jese ki beyat kabhi nahi kar saktaa"

 Autism is a mental disease whose symptoms start appearing from birth or from childhood

 No single cause of autism has been discovered
 anushodhon ke anusaar otism hone ke kai kaaran ho sakate hai jaise- Narcissism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of narcissism are complex and it is unclear whether the cause of ASD is polygynous or rare mutations
 durlabh maamalon main, aatmavimoh ko un karkon se bhi joda gaya he jo janm sambandhi dosha ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Other proposed causes, childhood vaccines, are controversial and there is no scientific evidence

 aajkal ek aatmavimohi samskruti viksit ho gayi he, jisame kuch logon ko ilaaj par vishwaas he or kuch logon ke liye aatmavimoh ek vikaar hone ke bajaay ek sthiti he
 Narcissism may be better understood by a group of specific symptoms than by a symptom
 mukhya lakshanon main shaamil hai saamaajik sampark main asamarthta, baatcheet karne main asamarthta, simit shauk or doharaav yukt vyavhaar he
 In other aspects, such as the strange way of eating, however, it is common but not necessary for diagnosis
 saamaajik vikaas aatmavimoh ke shikaar manushya saamaajik vyavhaar main asamarth hone ke saath hi duusare logon ke mantavyon ko samajhane main bhi asamarth hote hai is kaaran log aksar inhen gambhirtha se nahin lete
 Social disabilities last from childhood to adulthood
 otistic bachche saamaajik gatividhiyon ke prati udasin hote he, wo logo kii ore naa dekhte hai, naa muskuraate hai or zyaadaatar apana naam pukaare jane par bhi saamaanya: koi pratikriya nahin karte hai
 The behavior of autistic babies is even more shocking, they do not shake their eyes, and they often touch and shake the other person's hand to speak
 teen se paanch saal ke bachche aamtaur par saamaajik samaj nahin pradarshit karte he, bulaane par ekadam se pratikia nahin dete, bhaawanaaon ke prati asamvedansheel, mook vyavhaari or dusron ke saath mud jate hai

 otism ke lakshna dikhne par manochikitsak, manovaigyanik, yaa prashikshit special agucator se sampark karen
 Autism is a lifelong condition for which a drug search is on for complete treatment, so do not wander here and there for time to get information about it
 otism ek prakaar kii vikaas sambanghit beemaari he jise puri tarah to thik nahin kiya ja saktaa, parantu sahi prashikshan va paraamarsh ke dwaara rogi ko bahut kuch sikhaaya ja saktaa he, jo use apane roj ke jivan main apni dekharekh karne main madad karata he
 70% of the people with autism have mental retardation due to which they are not fully able to live a normal life, but if the mental impairment is not very high, then the person with autism can learn a lot

 a child with autism can be helped in the following ways- yadi baccha koi ek vyavhaar baar-baar karata he to use rokane ke liye use kuch aisi gatividhiyon main lagaaein jo use vyast rakhen taaki ve vyavhaar doharaa na sake, An album is a collection of recordings that are distributed via vinyl disc, compact cassette, compact disc, or digital medium

 The tradition of 'guru-shishya', which has been in existence since ancient times in Indian culture, is called tradition

 For example, the Bhagavata Purana describes the classification of the Vedas and its transfer by tradition
 yahaan gyaan ke vishay aadhyatmik, kalatmak, yaa shaikshanik ho sakate ham
 In the tradition, reverence is not only paid to the Guru but also to the three Gurus before him
 guruon kii sangyaaen is prakaar hai- Yask himself praised the tradition - ‘ayan mantrarthchintabhuhopi shrutitopi tarktah 
 That is, the idea of chanting is represented by listening or reasoning of traditional meaning
 kyonki - 'neither do you separate the mantra nirvaktavya: epics and nirvaktavya
 ' Interpretation of mantras cannot be isolated, but can only be done according to the case
 ‘na hyeshu pratyakashmasti anrisheratpaso vaa 
' By whom is the meaning of Vedas possible? Yask's statement on this subject is that - Humans are neither sages nor ascetics, they cannot interview a mantratha
