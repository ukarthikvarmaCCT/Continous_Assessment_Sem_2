 According to Maslov, "psychoanalysis has often shown that the basis for the relationship between a conscious desire and the ultimate unconscious goal need not be obvious

 kam se kam shodhakartaaon ke chaar dalon ne is samasya par dashakon swatantra rup se kaam kiya he or saamanytah unheen paanch mahaan karkon kii pahchaan kii he: tups or crystal sarvapratham the or unke baad hue oregon research institute main goldberg, ilinois uniwarsity main catel, or phir rashtriya swasthya sansthaanon main costa tathaa maccre
 shodhakartaaon ke in chaar dalon ne paanch lakshanon ko khojane main kuch alag tareekon kaa istemaal kiya or is prakaar paanch karkon ke prayek set ke naam or paribhaashaayen kuch alag hai
 However, all were found to be highly inter-correlated and factor-analytically well-organized
 yah note karnaa mahatvapurn he ki ye lakshan ucchtam str par vyaktitv ko vyavasthit karte hue paae gaye hai or isliye ve niyamit, nune-stareey vyaktitv lakshanon ke liye sarvaadhik sankalpanaatmak, suvyavasthit ruparekha ke rup main sahaayak hai
 However, the Big Five symptoms are so widespread and widespread that they are not nearly as effective at predicting and explaining actual behavior compared to the myriad of lower-level traits
 kai adhyayanon ne pushti kii he ki asankhya pahalu yaa praathmik str ke lakshanon ke vaastavik vyavhaar kaa purvanumaan lagaana or adhik prabhavi rahaa he These traits are often presented in percentage scores when scored for personal counter-notification
 udhaaharan ke liye, 80wein pratishat kaa kartavyanishtha darja apekshaakrit prabhaavshaalee jimmedaari kii bhaavana or suvyavastha ko suchit karata he, jabaki 5wein pratishat main bahirmukhataa darja ekant or shanti kii asaadhaaran aavashyaktaa ko suchit karata he
 Although these trait groups are statistical aggregates, exceptions may exist in individual personality profiles
 ausatan, log jo khulaapan main ooncha darja pate hai ve bauddhik rup se utsuk, bhaavana ke prati udaar, kala main ruchi rakhanevaale or nai chizon ke liye prayaas karne main tatpar hote hai
 However, a specific person may have a high overall openness score and may be interested in learning and exploring new cultures, but may have little interest in his art or poetry
 paristhiti prabhaav bhi maujuud ho sakate hai, jabaki bahirmukhiyon ko bhi kabhi-kabhi logon se dur samay kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 Frequently used measures of the Big Five may include items with self-descriptive sentences or, in the case of lexical measures, items that are single adjectives
 Because of sentence-based length and some lexical measures, shorter forms have been developed and ratified for use in applied research configurations where questionnaire space and answering time are limited, such as the 40-item Balanced International English big-five
 a very concise solution to mini-markers or big five domains
 khulaapan kala, bhaavana, saahas, asaamaanya vichaar, kalpana, jigyaasa or vividh anubhav ke prati saamaanya prashansa he
 This characteristic distinguishes imaginative people from practical, conventional ones
 log jo anubhav ke prati khule hai bauddhik rup se utsuk, kala kii saraahna karne vaale or khubsuurati ke prati samvedansheel hote hai
 They are compared to people who are perfect, more creative and aware of their feelings
 unke dwaara aparamparaagat vishwaas rakhe jane kii zyaada sambhaavna he
 People who score less in openness are likely to have more traditional, traditional interests
 ve jatil, aspasht or gudh kii tulana main adhik sade, eemaandaar or spashtataa ko pasand karte hai
 They can look at art and science with suspicion, attempts which they may find unattractive
 khulepan ke kuch swa-kathanon main shaamil hai: Dedication is a tendency to show self-discipline, be dutiful and aim for achievement
 yah visheshta sahaj vyavhaar ke bajaay yojanabaddhata ke prati praathamikta ko darshaati he
 It affects the way we control, regulate and control our impulses
 kartavyanishtha main shaamil he kaarysiddhi kii aavashyaktaa ke rup main gyaat kaarak
 Characteristics of extroversion are positive emotions, sociability and excitement and a tendency to love others
 The specialty of this feature is to connect clearly with the outside world
 Extroverts enjoy connecting with other people and are often considered enthusiastic
 ve utsahit, karrwai-unmukh vyakti hote hai, jinke dwaara utsaahpurn mauqon ke liye sadaa "haa!" yaa "chalo!" kehane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 In groups, they like to talk, stand firm and draw attention to themselves
 antarmukhi logon main saamaajik ullas or bahirmukhiyon jaisi gatividhi str kii kami rahati he
 They are calm, moderate, alert and less involved in the social world
 unke dwaara saamaajik bhagidaari kii kami ko shame yaa avsaad ke rup main nahin lenaa chahie
 antarmukhi logon ko bahirmukhiyon kii tulana main kam uttejnaa or adhik akelepan kii zarurat hoti he
 They can be very active and energetic, not just socially
 sahamtata dusron ke prati shankaalu or virdohi hone ke bajaay samvedansheel or sahyogshil hone kii pravriti he
 This trait reflects individual differences in general concern for social harmony
 sahamat hone vaale vyakti, anya logon ke saath chalane ko mahatv dete hai
 They are generally considerate, friendly, generous, helpful and willing to compromise their interests for others
 sahamat logon kaa maanav swabhaav ke prati ek ashaavadi drushtikon bhi hota he
 They believe that people are basically honest, decent and reliable
 asahmat log apane swaarth ko dusron ke saath chalane se zyaada maan dete hai
 They are generally indifferent to the well-being of others and less likely to be exposed to others
 kabhi-kabhi dusron ke prayojan ke bare main unka andeh unhen shankaalu, ruukhaa or asahyogi banaata he
 Psychosis is the tendency to experience negative emotions such as anger, anxiety, or depression
 ise kabhi-kabhi bhaavnaatmak asthirataa kaha jaataa he
 People who get high marks in dementia are emotionally reactive and vulnerable to stress
 unke dwaara aam halaaton ko sankatpurna or maamuli kunthaon ko niraashajanak rup se mushkil maanane kii sambhaavna zyaada he
 Their negative emotional reactions are likely to persist for an unusually long period of time, meaning that they are often in a bad mood
 manovikshubdhta main adhik ank paane vaale vyakti main bhaavnaatmak niyantran kii ye samasyaayein, unki spasht rup se sochane, nirnay lene or tanaav ke saath prabhavi dhang se jujhane kii kshamta ko kam karti he
 At the other end of the scale, individuals who score low in psychosis are not easily upset and are less emotionally reactive
 ve shant, bhaavnaatmak rup se sthir or satat nakaaratmak bhaawanaaon se mukt hote hai
 Freedom from negative emotions does not mean that low scores experience more positive emotions
 sar francis galton ve pehle vaigyanik the jinhone us chiz ko pahachaanaa, jo ab shabdic pariklpana ke naam se vikhyath he
 It is this idea that eventually encodes the most prominent and socially relevant personality differences in people's lives into language
 pariklpana kaa aage suzav he ki bhashaa ke namoonay se, yah sambhav he ki maanav vyaktitv lakshanon kaa ek vyapak vargeekaran nikaala jaae
 In 1936, Gordon Allport and H
S
 Odbert put this hypothesis into practice
 He studied two of the more comprehensive English dictionaries available at that time and drew 17,953 words describing personality
 He later extracted 4504 adjectives from this vast list, which he considered to be visible and relatively permanent features
 remand catel ne 1940 ke dashak main olport-odbart kii suchi praapt kii, manovaigyanik anusandhan se praapt shabdon ko joda or phir samanaarthi shabdon ko hataate hue kul shabdon ko 171 tak ghataya
 unhone baad main anusandhanadhin vyaktiyon se aise logon ko darja dene ke liye kaha jinako ve suchi main maujuud visheshnon se jaanate the or phir unki reating kaa vishleshan kiya
 Cattell identified 35 major groups of personality traits, which he referred to as "personality zones"
 ve or unke saathiyon ne phir in lakshanon ke liye vyaktitv pariksha kii rachana kii
 in pareekshanon se unhen praapt data kaa kaarak vishleshan kii sankhyikeey paddati sahit ubharate computer praudyogiki ke sangyojan ke saath vishleshan kiya gaya
 This resulted in sixteen major factors, which paved the way for the development of the 16PF personality questionnaire
 1961 main, vaayu sena ke do shodhakarta, arnest tups or remand crystal ne, aath vishaal namoonon se vyaktitv data kaa vishleshan kiya
 Using Cattell's symptom measures, he found five recurring factors, which he named "sociability", "agreeableness", "dependency", "emotional stability" and "culture"
 This work was repeated by Warren Norman, who found that five major factors are sufficient to calculate a large set of personality data
 norman ne in karkon ko milansaarita, sahamtata, kartavyanishtha, bhaavnaatmak sthirataa or samskruti kaa naam diya
 remand catel ne in vikaason ko apane 16PF model par ek hamale ke rup main dekha or kabhi vriddhishil paanch kaarak mataiky se sahamat nahin hue
 ve "

aanshik rup se 16PF pareekshan ke khilaaf nirdeshit he
 "in response to Goldberg's article 'the Structure of Phenotypic Personality Traits' in American Psychologists, Cattell stated that" no experienced factor-doer can agree with Dögoldberg's enthusiasm for the five-factor personality theory "
 His 16 This deterministic rejection of the FFM challenge to the causal model, Cattell, rb's end of life, 'the Fellowship of Five Factors in the Personality Sphere' The Psychologist, including A, is presented in an article published in The British Psychological Society, May issue, pp
 207-208
 agle do dashakon ke liye, badalati yugachetana ne vyaktitv anusandhan ke prakaashan ko mushkil kar diya
 apane 1968 pustak persenality and assesament main walter mishchel ne balpurvak kaha ki vyaktitv pareekshan 0
3 se adhik sahasambandh ke saath vyavhaar kaa purvanumaan nahin laga sakate
 mishchel jaise saamaajik manovaigyanikon kaa tark he ki aachaar-vyavhaar or ravaiya sthir nahin rahete, lekin sthiti ke saath parivartit hote hai
 Prediction of behavior was considered impossible by personality tests
 1970 ke dashak main kattarpanthi avasthitikaron ne is had tak jaakar bahes kiya ki vyaktitv keval anubhoot sanrachana he jo log dusron par thopate hai taaki duniya main sthirataa kaa bhram bana rahe
 Emerging methods challenged this approach during the 1980s
 Rather than predicting single instances of behavior, which was unreliable, researchers have found that they can predict behavior patterns by compiling a myriad of observations
 parinamswaroop vyaktitv or vyavhaar ke bich sahasambandhon kii paryaapt vruddhi hui or yah spasht tha ki "vyaktitv" vastav main maujuud tha
 Personality and social psychologists now generally agree that calculating human behavior requires both, personal and situational change
 lakshan siddhant jaays ban gaye or is kshetra main dilchaspee kaa punarutthan hua
 By 1980, psychologists had forgotten the pioneering research by Tupes, Crystal and Norman
 louis goldberg ne swayan apni shabdic pariyojna shuru kii, swatantra rup se dubaara paanch karkon kaa pataa lagaaya or kramshah manovaigyanikon kaa dhyaan us ore aakarshith kiya
 He later coined the term "big five" as a label for factors
 1981 ke dauraan honolulu main yojit ek sangoshtee main, chaar pramukh shodhakarta, louis goldberg, naomi techemoto-chok, andrew comare or jon em
 digmen ne us din ke uplabdh vyaktitv pareekshanon kii samiksha kii
 unhone nishkarsh nikaala ki sabase ashavan pareekshanon ne paanch samaanya karkon ke subset ko mapa, thik usee prakaar jaise normene ne 1963 main khoja tha
 This phenomenon was followed by widespread acceptance of the five-factor model among personality researchers in the 1980s
 In 1984 Peter Savill and his team incorporated the five-factor "pentagon" model with the original OPQ
 pentagon ke kuch samay baad 1985 main costa or maccre dwaara NEO paanch kaarak vyaktitv suchi prakashit kii gai
 One of the most important developments is the establishment of a five-factor model a general classification that first shows sequences in a scattered and disordered region
 vyaktitv ke paanch kaarak model ko anya sabhi se alag karne vaala tatv he ki vah kisi ek vishisht manovaigyanik ke siddhant par aadhaarit nahin he, balki bhashaa, prakritik vyavastha jo log ek duusare kii samaj ko sampreshit karne ke liye upyog main laate hai
 Numerous meta-analyzes confirmed the predictive value of the Big Five across a wide range of behaviors
 Soulsman and Page tested the relationship between Big Five personality dimensions and 10 personality disorder classes in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
 15 swatantra namoonon main se, shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki prayek vikaar ek adwitiya or bhavishyasuchak paanch-kaarak profil he
 The underlying underlying disorders were highly specific and consistent personality positive relationship with predictive psychosis and negative relationship with agreeableness
 kaary nishpaadan kshetra main, bairic or mount ne 23,994 sahabhaagiyon ke saath 162 namoonon kaa upyog karte hue 117 adhyayanon kii samiksha kii
 unhone paaya ki kartavyanishtha ne sabhi vyavsaayik samoohon ke liye sab nishpaadan mandandon main susangat sambandh darshaya
 bahirmukhataa saamaajik parsparik kriya shaamil vyavsaayon ke liye vaid bhavishyavaktaa tha
 In addition, experiences of extroversion and openness are valid predictors of training proficiency criteria
 1990 ke dashak se jab manovaigyanik sarvasammati se kramshah big five ke samarthan main aae, tab se in vyaktitv lakshanon ke ird-gird anusandhan kii vriddhishil nikaay rahi he All five factors appear to be influenced by both heredity and environment
 judawe adhyayan kaa suzav he ki ye prabhaav mote taur par baraabar anupaat main yogadan dete hai
 Analysis of available studies found overall heredity for Big Five symptoms as follows: anudairdhya data ke kai adhyayan, jo samay ke saath logon ke pareekshan prapthank or pratinidhik-samooh data ko sahasambandhit karte hai, jo vibhinn aayu samoohon ke aar-paar vyaktitv staron kii tulana karte hai, vayaskta ke dauraan vyaktitv lakshanon main ucch stareey sthirataa darshaate hai
 Recent research and meta-analyzes of previous studies, however, suggest that all five symptoms change at different points in life-span
 nayaa shodh paripakvata prabhaav saboot darshata he
 On average, agreeableness and dutiful levels typically increase over time, while extroversion, psychosis, and openness decrease
 in samuhik prabhaavon ke atirikt, vyaktigat matbhed bhi rahe hai: alag-alag log jivan ke sabhi charnon main adwitiya parivartan pattern pradarshit karte hai
 Intercultural research from 26 countries and then in 55 countries showed a global pattern of gender differences in responses to the list of Big Five
 mahilaayein lagaataar ucch manovikshubdhta or sahamtata report karti hai or purush aksar adhik bahirmukhataa or kartavyanishtha report karte hai
 Gender differences in personality traits are higher in affluent, healthy, and egalitarian cultures, where women have equal opportunities as men
 aksar yah suzav diya gaya he ki vyakti apane janm ke kram se bhinn hote hai
 Frank J
 Suloway argues that the order of birth is correlated with personality traits
 unka daawa he ki baad main paidaa hone vaale bachche kii tulana main pahalotha adhik kartavyanishth, adhik saamaajik rup se prabhavi, kam sahamat or nae vichaaron ke prati kam khulaa hota he
 Sulloway's case, however, has been questioned
 ek aalochana yah he ki unka data janm kram ke saath parivaar ke aakaar ko ast-vyast kar detaa he
 Subsequent analyzes showed that birth order effects have been found only in studies where personality traits of under-researched individuals are judged by family members or by acquaintances familiar with the birth-order under research
 Large-scale studies using random samples and self-report personality tests such as the NEO PI-R have found significant effects of birth order on personality
 big five ko german or chini jaisi kai vibhinn bhashaaon or samskritiyon main doharaaya gaya he
 Thompson demonstrated the Big Five structure across many cultures using the international English language scale
 haal hi ke kaary ne desh main ausat big five praptankon ke saath girt homested ke saanskrithik karkon, vyaktvaad, satta duuri, paurush or anischitata parihaar ke bich sambandh paaya he
 For example, the extent to which a country recognizes individualism is correlated with its average outwardness, while people living in cultures who are accepting more inequalities in their power structures are somewhat higher in duty
 in matbhedon ke kaaran abhi tak agyaat rahe hai; yah anusandhan kaa ek sakriy kshetra he
 Big five personality factors have been evaluated in some non-human species
 adhyayan kii ek shrinkhalaa main, chimpanzi vyaktitv prashnawali kaa upyog karte hue, chidyagharon, ek bade prakritik abhayaarany or ek anusandhan prayogshaala main saikadon chimpaziyon ke maanav reating ne karkon ko bahirmukh, kartavyanishth or sahamtata - saath hi, ek atirikt kaarak prabhutv - ke rup main darshaya he
 Psychosis and openness factors were found in the original zoo specimen, but not replicated in the new zoo specimen or other setting
 big five par adhik shodh kiya gaya he
 This has resulted in both criticism and support for the model
 aalochakon kaa tark he ki ek vyaakhyaatmak yaa bhavishyasuchak siddhant ke rup main big five kii gunjaaish ke liye daayre maujuud hai
 It is debated that the Big Five do not explain all human personality
 vyaktitv lakshan kii aiami sanrachana ko pahchaanane ke liye prayukt karypranali, kaarak vishleshan ko aksar vibhinn kaarak sahit samaadhaanon ke bich chayan ke liye vaishvik-manyata aadhaar na hone ke kaaran chunauti di gai he
 Another continuing criticism is that the Big Five is not inspired by the theory
 yah keval kaarak vishleshan ke adheen saath ekatrit hone kii pravriti vaale katipay vivarankon kii data-sanchalit jaanch he
 a common criticism is that the Big Five does not explain all human personality
 kuch manovaigyanik model se sirf isliye asahmat hai ki unka maananaa he ki vah dharmikata, chal / dhoortta, eemaandaaree, kifaayatipan, roodhiwaadita, purushatv / sritv, ghamand, vinod-vritti, pahchaan, swa-avadharana or prerana jaise anya vyaktitv domen kii upeksha kii he
 Similar to the inverse relationship between political conservatism and openness, correlations have been found between some of these variables and the Big Five, although these changes of symptoms are not well explained by the five factors themselves
 macadams ne big five ko "ajanabi kaa manovigyaan" naam diya he, kyonki ye un lakshanon ko sanderbhit karte hai jo ajanabi main apekshaakrit aasaani se dekhe ja sakate hai; vyaktitv ke anya pahalu joki adhik nijee taur par dhaarit hai yaa adhik sandarbh-aadhaarit hai, big five main varjit kiye gaye hai
 In many studies, the five factors are completely unambiguous with each other; Namely, the five factors are not independent
 aksar manovikshubdhta or bahirmukhataa ke bich nakaaratmak sah-sambandh dikhaai dete hai, udhaaharan ke liye, yah darshaate hue ki jo log adhik nakaaratmak bhaawanaaon kaa saamana karne main pravrutt he ve kam batooni or nirgaami hote hai
 Lambidity has been viewed by some researchers as desirable, as it reduces redundancy between dimensions
 yah vishesh rup se mahatvapurn he jab kisi adhyayan kaa lakshya jahaan tak sambhav ho kam parivartakon sahit vyaktitv kaa vyapak vivaran pradaan karnaa he
 The methodology used to identify the dimensional structure of individual traits, factor analysis, is often challenged due to not having a globally-recognized basis for selecting solutions with various factors
 arthath, paanch kaarak samaadhaan vishleshak dwaara kuch had tak vyakhya par nirbhar karata he
 Most factors may, in fact, be at the core of these five factors
 isane karkon kii "vaastavik" sankhya ke bare main vivaad ko prerit kiya he
 The proposers of the Big Five have reacted that although other solutions in a single dataset may be feasible, only the five-factor structure is consistently replicated in various studies
 aksar big five kii ore nirdeshit hone vaali ek pranalibaddh aalochana yah he ki adhikansh pramaan swa-report prashnawaliyon par he; swa-report purvaagrah or pratikriyaaon kaa mithyaakaran ke saath puri tarah se nipatna asambhav he
 This becomes especially important when considering why scores differ between individuals or groups of people - a difference in scores may represent an actual difference in personality, or they may simply be used by research persons to answer questions
 There may be craft facts of the way
 paanch kaarak sanrachana sahakarmi reporton main dohraye gaye hai
 However, many material findings rely on self-reports
 ek satat aalochana yah he ki big five kisi antarnihit siddhant par aadhaarit nahin he; yah keval anubhavjanya nishkarsh he ki kaarak vishleshan ke tahat kuch vivarnak ek saath jamaa ho jate hai
 Although this does not mean that these five factors are not present, the underlying reasons behind them remain unknown
 sansani kii chahat or prasannataa ek antarnihit siddhant kii vajah se bahirmukhataa ke saath jude nahin he; yah sambandh ek vyakhyeya anubhavjanya nishkarsh he
 Current research focuses on innumerable fields
 ek mahatvapurn sawaal he: kya paanch kaarak sahi hai? sthaneey shabdkoshon ke saath anya deshon main big five ko dohraane ke prayaas kuch deshon main safal rahe hai, lekin dusron main nahin
 jaahir he, udhaaharan ke liye, hungariyanon ke paas koi ek sahamtata kaarak kii maujuudagi dikhaai nahin detii
 anya shodhakarta sahamtata ke liye pramaan pate hai lekin anya karkon ke liye nahin
 In an attempt to explain the complete variation in personality traits, some have found seven factors, some eighteen, and some only three
 The determination of the possible number of factors depends primarily on what information is put into the factor analysis, the "theory")
 Since theory often undeniably occurs before empirical science, the Big Five and other proposed factor structures are always Essentially the factor should be judged according to the items that go inside the analytical algorithm
 Recent studies suggest that Su-clinical samples and psychiatric patients in DSM- based symptoms clarify the difference to seven or eighteen his consistent ability and weaknesses of factor models for counting
 1992 main paul sinclair or steve bairo dwaara sanchalit ek satyaapan adhyayan main tasb bank se 202 shakha prabandhakon ko shaamil kiya gaya
 It found several significant correlations with performance across 3 of the Big Five scale
 Correlations ranged from 0
21 to 0
33 and were noted across 3 scales: high extraversion, low psychosis, and openness to high experience
 jaanch kaa ek or kshetra he vyaktitv kaa ek sampurna model bananaa
 big five vyaktitv lakshan anubhavjanya prekshan hai, siddhant nahin; vyaktitv anusandhan ke prekshanon kii vyakhya abhi baaqi he
 Costa and mccrae created what they call the five-factor theory of personality as an attempt to explain personality from birth to death
 yadhyapi, ve shabdic pariklpana kaa paalan nahin karte, lekin big five ke sroton ke samaan hi, unheen sroton dwaara prerit siddhant-chaalit abhigam kaa paksh lete hai
 Another area of investigation is the downward extension of Big Five theory, or in childhood, the five-factor model
 Studies have shown that Big Five personality traits are correlated with children's social and emotional cohesion and educational achievement
 abhi haal hi main, paanch kaarak vyaktitv suchi - bachche prakashit kiya gaya jisamen 9 or 18 varsh ke bich vaale bacchon kaa moolyankan kiya gaya tha
 Perhaps the reason for this recent publication was the controversy related to applying the five-factor model in children

 In the modern era, artillery is considered to be the most dangerous element of ground warfare
 pratham vishwayuddh or dwitiya vishwayuddh donon main sab se adhik sainikon kii mrityu topakaanon se hi hui
 In 1944, the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, in a speech, described the artillery as the 'god of War'
 aadhunik yug kii jangon main haar-jeet main topakaanon kii itani badi bhoomika rahi he ki kuch samikshakon ke anusaar '16veen sadi main topakaanaa hi audyogic technology kii param uplabdhi thi' or kuch arase ke liye 'topon kaa nirmaan mukhya udyog tha'
 Artillery has also had a great influence in the history of the Indian subcontinent

 Inkaar is a Bollywood film directed by Sudhir Mishra, released in 2013
 iskaa lekhaan kaa kaary sudhir mishra or manoj tyaagi ne kiya he
 This film is the story of sexual harassment in the office
 arjuna rampal or chitrangada singh is film main mukhya bhoomika main hai
 Rahul Verma is a mentor in a big advertising company
 usee company main maaya naamak ek ladki bhi kaam karti he

 Castella is a variant of the Portuguese word castello
 iskaa sahi naam castelo de aguada hona chaiye, kintu iske nirmaataaon dwaara ise forte de bandora kaha gaya tha
 It is situated on the end of the land of Bandra Island
 1640 main portugaliyon ne ise pehre kii minar ke uddeshy se banaaya tha, kyonki yahaan se mahim kii khadi, arabi samudr or mahim ke dakshin dweep par acchhee najar rakhi ja sakati he

 vyakti keval shaareerik gunon se hi ek duusare se bhinn nahin hote balki maansik evam bauddhik gunon se bhi ek duusare se bhinn hote hai
 These differences are also innate
 kuch vyakti janm se hi prakhar buddhi ke to kuch mand buddhi vyavhaar vaale hote hai
 Nowadays intelligence is measured as intelligence gain which is a numerical value
 buddhi pareekshan kaa aashay un pareekshanon se he jo buddhi-labdhi ke rup main keval ek sankhya ke madhyam se vyakti ke saamaanya bauddhik evam usamen vidyaman vibhinn vishisht yogyataon ke sambandh ko ingit karata he
 Psychologists tried hard to find out how intelligent a person is
 buddhi ko maapne ke liye manovaigyanikon ne maansik aayu or shaareerik aayu kaarak prastut kiye hai or inke aadhaar par vyakti kii vaastavik buddhi-labdhi gyaat kii jaati he
 In the nineteenth century, there was a very bad attitude towards children and people with low intelligence
 unako zanjeeron main baandhakar rakhaa jaataa tha evam unhen peeta jaataa tha
 It was the belief of the people that demons have entered them
 in kathith duratmaon ko nikaalane hetu mand buddhi baalkon kii pitayee kii jaati thi
 Therefore, the problem for the children with slow intellect was that no one knew about their intelligence till that time
 france main buddhi-daurbalya yaa mandabuddhi baalkon kii is samasya ne gambheer rup dhaaran kar liya tab tak vahaan kii sarkaar or manovaigyanikon kaa dhyaan is samasya par gaya
 To solve this problem, the famous French psychologist Itard and after him Segyun sir used various methods to study and measure the merits of children with mental retardation
 is adhyayan ke antargat unhone kuch buddhi pareekshanon kaa nirmaan kiya
 Many schools were established for the treatment of children with mental retardation, where the children with mental retardation were tested and they were given training to develop their intellect
 is prakaar ke praytn germany, england tathaa america main bhi hue
 But the credit for the development work in the field of accurate measurement of intelligence test goes to France
 france main mandabuddhi baalkon ko sahi prashikshan dene ke liye evam unki shiksha kaa samuchit prabandh karne hetu ek samiti banaai gai or unka adhyaksh suprasiddh manovaigyanik alfred bine ko banaaya gaya
 He was the first psychologist who tried to understand intelligence in a scientific and systematic way
 unako buddhi ke maapan kshetra kaa janmdata mana jaataa he
 Binet made it clear that intelligence is not just a factor that we can measure by a particular test, but it is a complex process of various abilities that are implemented in a holistic manner
 san 1905 main binet ne saiman ke sahyog se pratham buddhi maapni arthath buddhi pareekshan kaa nirmaan kiya jise bine-saiman buddhi pareekshan kaa naam diya
 This intelligence test measures the intelligence of children between three and sixteen years of age
 is pareekshan main saralata se kathinata ke kram main tees padon kaa prayog kiya gaya
 Individuals' intelligence levels can be detected by this test
 is pareekshan kii sahaayta se mand buddhi baalkon ko teen samooh main baanta gaya he- In 1908, Binay made substantial amendments to his IQ test and published a revised IQ test
 is pareekshan main 59 pad rakhe
 These posts are in different groups, which relate to children of different ages
 is pareekshan main sarvapratham maansik aayu kaarak ko samajha gaya
 In 1911, Binay revisited his 1908 IQ test
 jab bine kaa bine saiman buddhi pareekshan 1908 vibhinn deshon jaise belgium, england, america, italy, germany main gaya to manovaigyanikon kii ruchi is pareekshan kii ore badi
 Later this test was also criticized because this test was suitable for lower age groups but it was not good for children of upper age group
 atah is kami kaa sudhaar karne hetu bine ne apane 1908 pareekshan main paryaapt sudhaar kiya
 He also improved and amended the flotation method of his test and in 1911 revamped his revised binned-simon scale or test
 unhone is pareekshan ke maansik aayu or balak kii vaastavik aayu ke bich sambandh sthapit kiya or iske aadhaar par unhone baalkon ko teen virgon main baanta ye varg hai- According to Binay, the children who solve the questions from their age group to the higher age group are said to have superior intelligence and if the child is able to solve the questions from the lower age group than their age group, then they would be the child with slow intellect
 Huh
 atirikt 1916 main america manovaigyanik termin ne bine ke buddhi pareekshan ko apane desh kii paristhitiyon ke anukool banaakar iskaa prakaashan kiya
 This test is called the Stanford – Binay test
 chunki is pareekshan kaa sanshodhan stenford vishvavidhyalay ke professor termin ne kiya
 On this basis, this test was called the 'stanford-binay test'
 1937 main pro em

 meril ke sahyog se 1916 ke stenford bine pareekshan main sanshodhan karke isamen kuch ankaganit ke prashnon ko bhi rakhaa
 The current revision of this test was published in 1960 from Stanford University

 In addition to the modifications of the binay-simon intelligence test, several intelligence tests were produced, including individual intelligence tests and group intelligence tests, speech and non-verbal intelligence tests

 Dharmaraja Yudhishthira, Bhimsen, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva gave the kingdom to the five Pandava Mahaprakrami Parikshit and went towards Uttarakhand for Mahaprayana and went there and received Punyaloka
 raja parakshit dharm ke anusaar tathaa brahnnon kii aagyaanusaar shashan karne lage
 He got married to Iravati, the daughter of Uttar Naresh and four sons were born to that noble wife
 acharya krip ko guru bana kar unhone jahnavi ke tat par teen ashwamegh yajna kiye
 In those sacrifices, eternal money was donated to Brahmins and they left for Digvijay
 unheen dinon dharm ne bail kaa rup bana kar gaurupini prithvi se saraswati tat par bhent kiya
 Gaurupini was tearing through the eyes of the earth and it seemed to be Shrihin
 dharm ne prithvi se poocha - "he devi! tumhaara mukh malin kyon ho rahaa he? kis baat kii tumhen chintaa he? kahin tum meri chintaa to nahin kar rahi ho ki ab meraa keval ek pair hi rah gaya he yaa phir tumhen is baat kii chintaa he ki ab tum par shudra rajya karenge?" Prithvi said - "O religion! You, despite being omniscient, ask me the reason for my grief! Truth, purity, forgiveness, mercy, contentment, renunciation, sham, dum, tenacity, simplicity, ability, scriptural consideration, overhead, learning, knowledge Contains qualities like quietness, valor, sharpness, opulence, force, memory, talent, skill, freedom, boldness, tenderness, patience, courage, modesty, humility, good luck, enthusiasm, seriousness, fame, faithfulness, stability, pride, egolessness etc

 Among the feet of Lord Krishna, which Lakshmi ji serves, are the symbols of lotus, vajra, ankush, flag etc

 " jab dharm or prithvi ye baaten kar hi rahe the ki mukutadhaari shudra ke rup main kaliyug vahaan aayaa or un donon ko maarane laga
 King Parikshit was passing by while doing Digvijay
 unhone mukutadhaari shudra ko haath main danda liye ek gaay or ek bail ko buree tarah peetate dekha
 The bull was very beautiful, it was white and had only one leg
 gaay bhi kamdhenu ke samaan sundar thi
 Both were shivering in fear
 maharaj parakshit apane dhanushwan ko chadhaakar megh ke samaan gambheer vaani main lalakaare - "re dusht! paapi! naradham! tu koun he? in nirih gaay tathaa bail kyon sata rahaa he? tu mahaan apradhi he
 The only punishment for your crime is your slaughter
 " unke in vachanon ko sun kar kaliyug bhay se kaanpane laga
 The Maharaj asked the bull that, o ox, your three legs are broken
 tum bail ho yaa koi devtaa ho
 Hey Dhenuputra! You tell me your own account fearlessly
 he gaumata! ab tum bhaymukt ho jaao
 i punish the wicked
 kis dusht ne mere rajya main ghor paap kar ke pandavon kii pavitra kirti main yah kalank lagaaya he? chaahe vah paapi saakshaat devtaa hi kyon na ho main uske bhi haath kaat doongaa
 Then Dharma said - "O Maharaj! You are born in the clan of the Pandavas, the supreme devotees of Lord Krishna, so these words are worthy of you
 he rajan! ham yah nahin jaanate ki sansar ke jeevon ko koun klesh detaa he
 It has been described in many ways in the scriptures as well
 jo dwait ko nahin maanata vah dukh kaa kaaran apane aap ko hi sweekaar karata hai
 One considers destiny as the cause of sorrow and one considers karma as the cause of sorrow
 katipay vidwaan swabhaav ko or katipay ishwar ko bhi dukh kaa kaaran maanate hai
 So, o Rajan! Now you decide who is the cause of the misery
 " On hearing the words of the bull, the Emperor Parikshit said - "O Taurus! You are definitely a religion in the form of a bull and this cow god is Prithvi Mata
 aap dharm ke marm ko bhalee-bhanti jaanate hai
 You can not cheat anyone, that is why you are not giving the name of the person who is suffering

 Three stages remain in Treta, only two remain in Dwapar and now due to this evil Kali Yuga, only one phase has been left for you
 yah adharmarupi kaliyug apane asaty se us charan ko bhi nasht karne kaa praytn kar rahaa he
 The evil sinful Shudra kings will enjoy this beautiful land due to Lord Srikrishna Chandra's own movement, that is why this mother is also sad
 " Saying so, King Parikshit took out his sharp-edged sword to kill that sinful Shudra royalty Kali Yuga
 kaliyug ne bhaybheet hokar apane rajasi vesh ko utaar kar raja parakshit ke charnon main gir gaya or traahi-traahi kehane laga
 King Parikshit was a great refugee Vatsal, he did not think it appropriate to kill the Kaliyuga who came in the shelter and said to the Kaliyuga - "O Kaliyuga! You have come to my shelter, so i gave you my life
 kintu adharm, paap, jhooth, chori, kapat, daridrata aadi anek updravon kaa mul kaaran keval tu hi he
 Therefore, leave my kingdom immediately and do not come back again
 " Hearing these words of King Parikshit, Kali Yuga said in a Katar voice - "O Rajan! Your kingdom is on the whole earth, there is no place outside my kingdom where i can reside
 he bhupati! aap bade dayaalu hai, aapane mujhe sharan diya he
 Now you have to manage some kind of my residence with mercy
 " When Kali Yuga said this, King Parikshit got into thinking
 phir vichaar kar ke unhone kaha - "he kaliyug! dyut, madhpan, parastrigaman or hinsa in chaar sthanon main asaty, mad, kaam or krodh kaa nivas hota he
 i allow you to live in these four places
 " is par kaliyug bolaa - "he uttaranandan! ye chaar sthaan mere nivas ke liye aparyaapt hai
 Please give me some other place of mercy
 " kaliyug ke is prakaar maangane par raja parakshit ne use paanchava sthaan 'swarna' diya
 Kali Yuga went away from there after meeting these places, but after going some distance, he came back in an invisible form and resided in the golden crown of King Parikshit
 iske baad parikshit shikaar ke liye bahut bhatke or bhukh or pyaas ke maare unka bura haal tha 
 Losing weary in the evening, he reached the ashram of Shamik Rishi and at that time the sage was absorbed in the Brahmin Samaghi
 
 Parikshit said that we are thirsty we need water, there is no one here, are you listening, we are talking about the king, we are thirsty, we need water, you do not hear whether the sage was a Brahmin in the tomb at that time
 - Three times asked for water but the sage's house was not broken
 
 Kaliyuga sitting in Rajmukut got inspired by his true wisdom and decided to punish the sage
 parantu raja ke achche sanskaro ke kaaran unhonen apane-aap ko us paap se roak liya 
 In a fit of rage, he put the dead snake around the sage
 us shamik rishi kaa putr shringi bada hi tejasvi tha us samay vah nadi main naha rahaa tha
 The second sage Kumaro went and narrated the whole ritual
 ki kis prakaar ek raja ne uske pita kaa tiraskaar kiya he unki baat sunakar vah krodh se pagal ho gaya or usee shran nadi kaa anjuni main bharkar usne raja ko shraap diya jis abhimaani or murkh raja ne mere mahaan pita kaa ghor apmaan kiya he vahi mahapapi aaj se santve din takshak naag ke kaatane se prachand bhisha agni main jalakar bhasma ho jaayegaa Courtesy of Sukhsagar ghanatv The density ireland rajshahi, ireland dweep par 1542 se 1800 ke bich vidyaman angrezi rajshahi kaa ek kathputli rajya tha

 Going further than this, sometimes the words, names, analogies, metaphors, etc
, also speak of the existence of the soul
 sarvatmavaad kaa darshan mukhyatya adivasee samaajon main paaya jaataa he parantu yah shinto evam hinduon ke kuch sampradaayon main bhi paaya jaataa he
 There are often three types of beliefs or ideas prevalent among humans regarding soul, soul or organism
 kuch log to charvak ke anuyaayiyon kii tarah, shariron se swatantra yaa pruthak jeevon yaa atmaaon kii koi satta hi nahin maanate
 According to him, consciousness arises as a result of the actions of the root brain in the same way as bile from the liver; It is not a quality or form of a non-material element or substance called a creature or soul
 iske viruddh kuch logon ke vichaar main chetana bhautik tatwon se utpann nahin hoti, kintu bhautik padaarthon se vilakshan aatma yaa jeev kaa gun he
 For example, Jain thinkers, while acknowledging the independent existence of organisms, defined the organism in these words as "chetnlakshano Jeeva:"
 parantu aatma yaa jeev kii satta sweekaar karanevaale sab vyakti ek mat ke nahin
 They can be broadly divided into two classes
 ek to ve jo keval manushyon or kuch ucch koti ke pashupakshiyon main hi aatma kaa astitv sweekaar karte hai or duusare ve jo na keval manushyon or pashupakshiyon main hi apitu keet-patangon or ped-paudhon aadi main bhi, jinhen duusare log jad samajhate hai, aatma yaa jeev ke astitv par vishwaas karte hai
 This same type of belief or idea of human beings is called animism

 real and earth Shri Adi has also believed in the existence of soul in movable roots
 at: unhen sarvatmavaadi vichaar kaa samarthak kaha ja saktaa he
 In fact, in trees, planets, subconscious, even unconscious things, people who believe in the power of soul or organism are still found in many countries, such as the cow of the world, which are often not only of spirits, especially of their dead ancestors, but of such souls
 They also worship people whom they do not understand as related to any particular body or object or to the deity of natural substances or arrogant deities

 baat bad gayi,talavaarein khinch gai or ve vahaan aapas main ladakar samaapt ho gayi
 Whose goddesses still exist in Morkhana
 susawaani kaa yah aashray vriksh san
1229 se lekar aaj tak usee sthaan par haraa bharaa khadaa he
 The ancient temple of Lord Shiva where God himself appeared and threw his tongs at the Ker tree, causing the earth and the tree to burst out maa susawaani ji kaa aashray vriksh san
1229 se lekar aaj tak usee sthaan par haraa bharaa khadaa he ker ke vriksh kaa vah sthaan jahaan par bhagwaan shiv kaa chimata girane se yah jameen ke saath do bhaagon main vibhajit ho gaya tha maa susawaani singh ke sahit usamen samaa gai or jameen phir jyon kii tyon ho gai Satidas Surana of Nagaur
 jinke dhar divya kanya aana
 
 puure ghar main khushiyaan chai
 Suswani Mata ji came home
 
 Samvat twelve hundred and ninety nine
 aayu thi das varsh ke bich
 
 shaadi kii ho gai taiyaari
 The little girl is very big
 
 The Dugdad family was born
 khushiyaan chai aseem apaar
 
 susawaani jab bane bethi
 The incident became a surprise
 
 a Muslim subedar
 jisane sabko kiya hoshiyaar
 
 sundar kanya thi susawaani
 He decided to get married
 
 Father was terrified after hearing this
 kaise musalmaa sang paranaayen
 
 ye sambandh nahin ho saktaa
 The Subedar was stubborn
 
 For not obeying
 dhamkee de di garaj-garaj kar
 
 kolhu main pisva daaloongaa
 i will kill everyone by number
 
 Seth Satidas was a Hindu candidate
 nas-nas main hindutv bharaa tha
 Strongly turned down the offer
 soobedaar ne jail bhijwaya
 
 ghar waalon ko pataa chalaa jab| susawaani ji ko kosa tab
 
 man hi man jab dukhi hui mata
 The unhappy mind only cares for the Lord
 
 Thank you to Nan Mund Arihant
 dhyaan hi dhyaan main nindiya ai
 God stunning in a dream
 darshan dekar kaha vachan main
 
 ghabaraane kii baat nahin he
 This is not his place
 
 You will call that wicked one
 shart rakhi he tere aage
 
 saat paanvade kii chhot dekar
 Chase the horse up
 
 He will not be able to catch you
 daud-daud kar thak jaayegaa
 
 swapn kaa haal kahaan maate se
 The forehead saffron was adorned with tilak
 
 Give message to Subedar
 kuch naa ghatane kaa andeshaa
 
 donon taraf hi khushiyaan chai
 He gave release to Seth
 
 Suswani ji was standing ready
 ye to pariksha kii hi ghadi thi
 
 daud se pehle dwaar pe ai
 Kunkum's hand raided
 
 It is as it is in stone
 satya katha kaa wo dyotak he
 
 sasavani ji jab thak ke haari
 Calling mother to protect 
 Then there was loud air
 sher pe baith gai susawaani
 
 daud ke morkhana jab pahaunchi
 Shiva was inside the temple
