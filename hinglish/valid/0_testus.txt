 jab unhone kingston, road island main balwari janaa shuru kiya tab unki shikshak ne unhen unke upnaam jhumpa se bulaane kaa faisla kiya, kyonki unke asli naam ke mukaable iskaa uccharan karnaa aasaan tha
 Lahiri recalls, "I was always very embarrassed by my name
 


 aapako aisa lagata he ki aap jo hai vah bane rahakar kisi or ke liye dard kaa kaaran ban rahe hai
 "lahiri's duality on his identity is the inspiration for the duality of his novel The Namesake's protagonist Gogol due to his unusual name

 lahidi, brukaleen neuyork main apane pati or do bacchon ke saath rahati he, jinka naam he octavio or nur 
 Lahiri's earlier short stories faced rejection from publishers for "years"
 His first short story collection, Interpreter of Maldies, was finally released in 1999
 yah kahaniyaan bhartiya yaa bhartiya pravaasiyon ke jivan main samvedansheel duvidhaon jaise vaivaahik kathinaaiyon, garbhpaat or pehali or duusari peedi ke sanyukt rajya america ke pravaasiyon ke bich asampark jaise vishyon ko sambodhit karti hai
 Lahiri later wrote, "when i first started writing, i didn't know that my subject was an indian-american experience
 jis chiz ne mujhe is shilp kii ore aakarshith kiya vah tha mere andar kii donon duniya ko ek hi panne par utaarne kii ichha, jise vaastavik jivan main karne kaa naa to mujhamen saahas he or naa hi paripakvata
" yah sangrah america aalochakon dwaara saraahaa gaya, lekin bharat main ise mili-juli samikshaayen praapt hui, jahaan vaikalpik rup se sameekshak utsahit bhi the or saath hi vikshubdh bhi the kyonki lahidi ne "bharatiyon ko ek adhik sakaaratmak bhoomika main nahin rachaa
 "interpreter of Maldies sold 600,000 copies and received the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction 2003 main, lahidi ne apana pehla upanyaas di nemsek prakashit karaayaa
 yah kahani ganguli parivaar ke jivan ke tees varshon se bhi adhik samay main buni gayi he

 prakashit hone par anekstomd arth ne di neuyork times kii sarvshereshth vikreta suchi par number 1 par shuruyaat kii
 neuyork times ke pustak samiksha sampadak, dwite garnor ne kaha, "yah yaad karnaa mushkil he ki aakhri baar kab koi vastav main gambhir, acchhee tarah se likhit katha - vishesh rup se kahaniyon kii kitaab ai thi - jo sidhe number 1 par pahunch gayi; yah lahidi ke nae vanijyik prabhaav kaa pradarshan he
 " lahidi kaa di new yorker patrika ke saath bhi visisth sambandh tha jisamen unki kai laghu kathaayen prakashit hui, jiname se adhikansh kaalpanik or kuch akaalpanik thi jisamen shaamil thi di laung ve home; kooking lesans, yah kahani lahidi or unki maa ke bich ke sambandh main khaane ke mahatv ke vishay main thi

 farvari 2010 main, paanch anya logo ke saath unhen maanavtaa or kala sambandhi samiti kaa sadsy niyukt kiya gaya
 Lahiri's writing is characterized by his "simple" language and his characters, who are often Indian immigrants living in the US, who have to reconcile the cultural values of their birthplace and the adopted home
 lahidi ke upanyaas aatmakathaatmak hote hai or yah aksar unke apane or saath hi saath unke mata pita, mitron, parichiton or bengali samudaay ke anya logon ke tajurbon par aadhaarit hota he jinase ve parichit hai
 Lahiri examines the struggles, concerns and prejudices of her characters so that the immigrant can compose the details and details of psychology and behavior
 anekstamd arth tak unhone adhiktar pehali peedi ke bhartiya america apravasiyon par or apane desh se bhinn ek desh main apane parivaar ko paalane ke liye unke sangharsh par dhyaan kendrit kiya
 In their stories they grow up to make their children aware of Indian culture and traditions and to keep them connected with the Indian tradition of joint family, in which parents, their children and the family of children live under the same roof
 Even after she describes his efforts to keep her close to him
 anekstamd arth, purv kii is mul prakruti se dur he kyonki isamen lahidi ke paatr vikaas ke nae daur main kadam rakhte hai
 These stories seek the fate of the second and third generations
 jaise-jaise baad kii peediyaan america samskruti ko badhate paimaane par aatmsaat karne lagati hai or aaraam se apane mul desh se baahar apana drushtikon banane lagati hai, lahidi kii kahaniyaan un ligon ke vyaktigat aavashyaktaaon par sthanantarit ho jaati he
 They show how later generations had drifted away from the shackles of their immigrant parents, often devoted to their responsibility to their community and to other immigrants

 Acharyanok, Acharya is a book of joyous poetry
 acharya anandavardhan kavyashastra main 'dhwani sampradaay' ke pravartak ke rup main prasiddh hai
 Phonics is divided into industries
 isamen kul chaar udyot hai
 Sound theory has been established by contradicting the opposing principles of sound theory in the first industry
 dwitiya udyot main lakshanamula or abhidhamula ke bhedon or upabhedon par vichaar kiya gaya he
 In addition, the properties are also highlighted
 tritiy udyot padon, vaakyon, padaanshon, rachana aadi dwaara dhwani ko prakashit karata he or ras ke virdohi or virodhrahit upaadaanon ko bhi
 The use of sound and quality satire has been published in the fourth Udyot, the origin of miracles in poetry
 dhvanyalok ke teen bhaag hai- karika bhaag, us par vritti or udhaaharan
 According to some scholars, the creator of Karika Bhag is Acharya Sahridaya and Acharya Anandavardhana of Vrittibha
 aise vidwaan apane uktamat ke samarthan main dhvanyalok ke antim shloke ko aadhaar maanate hai- But according to Acharyas such as Kuntaka, Mahimabhatta, Kshemendra etc
, Acharya Anandavardhana is the leader of both the karika part and the vritti part
 acharya anandavardhan bhi swayan likhte hai- Here he has described himself as the originator of sound theory
 iske pehle vaale shloke main prayukt ‘sahruday’ shabd kisi vyaktivishesh kaa naam nahin, balki sahruday logon kaa vaachak he or karika tathaa vritti, donon bhaagon ke rachayita acharya anandavardhan ko hi maananaa chahie
 Two commentaries were written on this unique book - 'chandrika' and 'lochan'
 haalaanki keval ‘lochan’ tikaa hi aaj uplabdh he
 The author of whose writing is Abhinav Guptapada
 ‘chandrika’ tikaa kaa ullekh inhone hi kiya he or uskaa khandan bhi kiya he
 This mention shows that the commentator of the 'chandrika' vaccine was also an ancestor of Acharya Abhinavagupta
 bhartiya sahityashastra ke itihaas main ‘dhvanyalok’ ek ugantarkari granth he
 By the origin and reputation of sound theory through this book, Anandavardhan attained the most important Anjar and Immortal place in the field of literature
 anandavardhan ke pashchaadvarti sahityashastriyon- abhinavgupt, mammat, vishwanath, panditraj jagannatha aadi ne anandavardhan kii saahitiyik manyataon ko sweekaar karke unke mat kaa poshan kiya
 In the field of literature, Anandavardhana has got the same place as Panini in the field of grammar science and Adi Shankaracharya in the field of Vedanta
 acharya anandavardhan ne apane se pracheen yug kii sahityashastreey manyataon or aalochana ke siddhanth ke maarg ko mode kar ek nayaa maarg prashast kiya tha
 Panditraj Jagannath has rightly said that the soundman had arranged and distinguished the path of the rhetoric
 jab sanskrit sahityashastra main kavy ke sthool sharir arthath vaachak shabd or vachya arth ko hi kavyashastra sajaane sanvaarane main kavyatv kii pratishtha samajhi jaati thi, acharya anandavardhan ne yah pratipaadit kiya ki kavy main do prakaar ke arth sahruday-shlaghya hote hai- vachya or pratiyaman
 Vachaya Earth Upma etc
 has become famous
 pratiyaman arth mahakaviyon kii vaani main usee prakaar vilakshan soundarya kaa aadhaan karata hua rahata he, jis prakaar ‘anganaaon main lavanya
 This seeming meaning is the soul of poetry
 jis kavy main pratiyaman arth kaa soundarya mukhya rup main hota he, vah kavy sabase shreshth he
 That is called sound
 anandavardhan dwaara dhwani shabd kaa prayog or dhwani-sampradaay kii sthapana ek naveen adwitiya mahatvashaalee kaary tha
 The basis of the establishment of sound is the realization of the meaning appearing by the vyjana vritti
 pratiyaman arth kii pratiti anandavardhan se purvakaal main na maani gai ho, aisi baat nahin he
 Even before Anandavardhana, the rhetoricians had accepted the existence of a seeming meaning different from the spoken meaning in poetry and thus touched the path of sound
 parantu dhwani ke maarg kaa sparsh karke bhi unhone uski vyakhya nahin kii or yah kaary anandavardhan ko karnaa padaa
 Anandavardhan has written this fact in his book as follows- shri i krishna aiyyar ek bhartiya vakil, swatantraaa senaanee, shastreey kalakaar evam kaaryakarta the
 He is credited with popularizing Bharatanatyam in South India as Bharatanatyam was an art form which had reached the point of dying in India

 This is expected to provide a further fillip to card transactions in the country, thereby reducing the use of currency
 In the 2009–12 vision document, the Reserve Bank of India considered the possibilities of establishing an indigenous card for India

 vemar andolan bodh, samvednaa or romantism kaa milajula rup he
 He translated Kalidasa's Abhigyan Shakuntalam into German
 gete ne abhigyaan shaakuntalam ke bare main kaha tha- Goethe's 82-year long life is related to an era of European history that has been considered a time of great revolutions and upheavals
 uske yuvavastha ke aarambh main german sahitya main kranti kaa udai hua, jiske falswaroop puraani manyataon tathaa saahitiyik siddhanton kaa teevr virodh hua or kavi tathaa kalakaar kii swatantraaa tathaa rashtriya sahitya ke puraane gaurav ke punaruddhar kaa joardaar samarthan hua
 In this 'stormy era', the spirit of revolution appeared like a raging storm, which razed the ruins of old ideas and shabby principles
 iske pashchaat uske jivan ke madhyahn main france kii raajnneetik kranti kaa tufaan aayaa jisane puraani vyavastha kii bhitti hilaa di or lakhon vyaktiyon ke hriday main swarnyug ke sundar swapn kaa srijan kiya, yadhyapi yah swapn mrigamarichika ke samaan hi kshanik siddh hua, kyonki isi ke garbh se napolian kaa aavirbhaav hua, jisaki drutagami vijayvahini ne europe main aashaa ke sthaan par purna nairashya kaa samrajya sthapit kiya
 Finally, in the twilight of his life, he fully experienced the extensive changes of the Industrial Revolution and also saw the rise of the new economic system which was slowly becoming clear by breaking the old structure of the society
 in sabhi anubhavon kii chhap uski kritiyon main spasht he, kyonki uskaa samvedansheel hriday bahya paristhitiyon se twarit prabhavit hota tha
 He was a very lucky man
 uske jivan main abhaav kii chaaya kabhi nahin ai
 Nature had given her the gift of beauty and health as well as her versatility which made her successful and prestigious in various fields
 vah keval kavi yaa kalakaar hi nahin tha, apitu ek safal vaigyanik, sadhak tathaa darshanik bhi tha
 He had authority over many languages of Europe; His knowledge was infinite and in the princely state of Beemer, he spent a valuable part of his life in responsible work like governance and theater operations

 His strong writing created an abundance of lyrical poetry, epics, novels, plays, and critical works, and he did not touch any subject leaving him unaffected by his power, novelty and originality
 gete kii vibhinn kritiyon main uske vyaktigat anubhavon kaa samavesh hua he or un sabhi ko ek sutara main baandhanevaala tatv uskaa vyaktitv he jo samay ke saath saath viksit hota rahaa
 Therefore, it can be said that his moral, intellectual and spiritual character is contained in his various works
 jivan ke vasant kaal main uski bhavanaayen teevr tathaa saral thim or uskaa abhivyanjan saral kintu joardaar bhashaa main hota tha jo bhavuk hriday kaa naiysargik udgaar prathit hoti thi
 But with the maturation of Mastash, the dignity of the sentiment and the sophistication of the language and the complexity of the verses began to grow and eventually his words became burdensome with the expressions and the expressions of the heart were controlled by the discipline of the mind
 iskaa arth yah he ki usne apane vyaktitv kii virdohi pravritiyon main samanvay sthapit karne kaa safal prayaas kiya or uskaa samast sahitya tathaa darshan isi tarah se samanvay ke punit kartavya kaa upadesh detaa he
 He emphasized that the introverted nature of man is harmful and it is necessary to make it extroverted so that there can be healthy harmony between the individual and society, soul and external nature
 is tathy kaa parichay uski sabhi kritiyon main miltaa he
 His lyrical poetry begins with personal love, but in the long run his strong connection to man and nature is his main subject - the nature that is cosmic and with which the soul of man has an unwavering relationship because the diverse beings of creation are tied in the thread of unity
 uske teen pradhan upanyaas bhi uske vikaas ke teen vibhinn pahaluon ke dyotak hai
 The first and most well-known among them is 'vardar', an impressive portrait of the soul of 'romantic' Europe
 yah aise navayuvak kaa chitra he jo jivan se ub gaya he kyonki bahya jagat main uske liye koi ras yaa saar nahin he
 His heart is filled with bizarre depression and in the end his isolation becomes so bitter that he ends up in suicide
 gete ke baad ke likhe hue do upanyaas ‘vilhem mistr’ or iskaa parvarti sanskaran style ke vikaas ke saath hi saath vyakti tathaa samaaj ke saamanjasy kaa maarg prashast karte hai or aakhri granth main to lekhak ne audyogic yugin samaaj vyavastha tathaa usamen nihit samasyaon kaa safal tathaa sajiv vishleshan kiya he
 Plays have a special place in Goethe's works and the main ones are 'gotze', 'yagmant', 'ifegini', 'taso' and 'foust'
 yahan par itnaa kahana hi paryaapt hoga ki ‘foust’ gete kii pratibha kaa sarvottam pratik tathaa vishwasahitya kaa amuly ratna he
 The history of its creation is the history of the development of 'goethe' and the life story of the protagonist of the play is the story of the development of human soul
 ‘foust’ madhyayugin loksahitya kaa purvaparichit paatr he jisko gete ne maanavtaa kaa pratik mana he
 This person is initially beset with ego like a warder, but gradually his mind is attracted towards other persons and the external world
 pehla charan ek abodh ladki se prem he jiskaa ant du:khamay siddh hota he, phir uskaa pravesh samaaj main hota he or hellen ke sampark main aakar vah karm kii upadeyata kaa paath padhata he or ant main ek vistrut bhukhand kaa swami hokar uske vikaas main laga hua apni jeevanalila samaapt karata he
 The explanation of 'faust' is quite elaborate
 gete kii paini drushti ne bahut se tatwon kaa avishkaar kiya jinka viksit rup kalantar main bodhgamy hua
 His works contain the core tenets of evolutionism and Marxism and they also find substantial support for the ideology that made autocratic rulers and leaders like Hitler popular in Germany and worthy of the public's reverence and worship, although all their power was the work of demolition
 i wasted angreji ke prasiddh kavi ornald ne gete ko ‘louh yug kaa chikitsak’ bataaya he, par gete ke vichaar aaj bhi naveen tathaa sajiv hai
 The words of praise he has used for Kalidasa's Shakuntal are also suitable for his creations - because even the Saurabh of Vasantha and the sweet juice of Shishir are perfectly mixed
