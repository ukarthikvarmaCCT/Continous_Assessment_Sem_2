 in prabandhon kaa upavibhaajan padon athwa geeton main hua he
 Each verse or song has eight verses
 geeton ke vaktaa krishna, radha athwa radha kii sakhi hai
 All other forms of Indian love - elation, jealousy, anticipation, despair, anger, honor, reunion, and joy, etc
 - are described with great tenacity and skill, except with extreme despair and nihvadhi-disconnection
 prem ke in sabhi roopon kaa varnan atyant rochak, saras or sajiv hone ke atirikt itnaa sundar he ki aisa prathit hota he, maano kavi shaastra, arthath chintan ko bhaavana kaa rup athwa amoort ko moort rup dekar use kavita main parinit kar rahaa he
 Samodamodar akleshkeshav Enchanted madhusudan snigdh madhusudan Sankaksha Pundriksha kunthabaikuntha Nagarnarayan bilakshyalakshmipathi Mandmakund chatur chaturbhuj Sanand damodar supritipitambar Geetgovind is such a poetic work written in the 12th century that tells us about the love of Lord Krishna and Radharani
 isame kul 12 adhyay he
 This poem is the work of Jayadeva, a Brahmin living in a village named Bhubaneswar and Puri in the central state of Odisha state, in the central Kendubilva or Kenduli regime
 jayadev ne unki patni padmavati ke sahayata se is ko aisi rupaantar kiya ki tatkalin utkal ke raja irsha karne lage
 Then, when the principal Jagannathji of Geetagovind told the king in a dream, the devasis of the temple started offering the Odissi dance form in front of Lord Jagannath in the solitary service of the night and in the morning service
 pahele vidwano k maananaa tha ki jayadev bengal ke raja ke sabhakavi he
 But the inscriptions and ancient temples which are present in Odisha proved that Jayadev was a devotee of Jagannath and a resident of Utkal kingdom
 aaj bhi orishi nrity ke madhyam se gitgovind sarvajneen priy ho rahaa he
 The Odissi dance itself indicates Jaydev to be the Odisha province
 unki gitgovind kavy ki prachaar padoshi andhra, tamilnadu tathaa karnataka main hua
 Then it took place in North India, especially in Rajasthan by Mirabai
 gurugranth sahib main bhi bhagat jayadev kaa naam likh he jo gitgovind ke rachayita hai
 The composition and skill of 'geetgovind' poetry is so new and so fundamental that it is difficult to decide its poetry
 kuch paashchaatya vidvan ise ‘graamy-roopak’ kehete hai, to anya sameekshak ise ‘geetinataka’ kehete hai, to kach anyon ke mat main yah kavy ‘parishkrut yatra’ he
 Pichel accepts this poem as a 'musical metaphor'
 levi ise geet or roopak kaa madhyavarti athwa samanvit rup maanate hai, parantu jayadev ne apni is kriti kaa sargon main vibhaajan karke ise naatak ke sthaan par kavy maanane kii apni dharna kii ore hi sanket kiya he
 It is worth mentioning here that in this poetry there is nothing like drama, preface etc
 kuch vidvan ise ‘shringaar mahakavy’ kii sangya bhi dete hai
 Krishnaswamy Iyengar, in his book 'A History of Indian Opera', has considered 'gitagovind' poetry as a complete form of music and its development and excellent acceptance in the sixteenth-century Sri Tirthanarayana Swamy's work 'krishnilila Tarangini'
 is sambandh main acharya baldev upaadhyaay kaa anumaan par aadhrut kathan he ki ‘gitgovind’ ke padon ke saath raagon or taalon ke diye gayi naamon se is tathy kaa anumaan hota he ki kavi kii drushti kadachit un dinon bengal main prachlit yatra mahotsavon kii ore rahi ho, jisamen nrity or sangeet ke saath geeton kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha
 On this basis, this poem can also be considered as 'musical form'
 maanviya soundarya ke chithran main prakruti ko bada hi mahatvapurn sthaan praapt he
 In this context, in the 'geetgovind' poetry, a beautiful description of Rituraj Vasant, chandra-jyotsna, Surbhit Samir and the seductive keys of the Yamuna coast is seen
 yahaan tak ki is kavy main pakshi tak prem kii shakti or mahima kaa gaan karte hue drushtigochar hote hai
 Jayadeva has used the Vaidarbhi ritual — a style of melodious expressive characters — in this poem
 kavy main kahin-kahin deergh samaason kaa prayog avashya hua he, parantu phir bhi durbodhata athwa clishtataa nahin aane paayi
 In fact, the poet had composed songs only for the songs of the common people on special festivals
 atah unhen subodh rakhana aavashyak hi tha
 The songs not only have exceptional naturalness, but they also have unique melody
 ‘gitgovind’ kii rachana-style kii prashansa main mcdonal kaa kathan he—‘‘soundarya main, sangitamay vachanopanyas main or rachana ke saushthav main sampoorn sanskrit sahitya main ‘gitgovind’ kavy style kii upama nahin milti
 It is clear from the study of poetry that the poet has an amazing ability to make a tremendous impact on his readers and listeners, by the fast stream of short posts, and sometimes by the rhythmic movement of long compositions composed with tact
 kavi naanaa chhandon ke prayog main hi siddhhast nahin, apitu charnon ke madhya or ant main tukatmakataa laane main bhi adwitiya he
 '' ‘gitgovind’ kavy main jayadev ne paramparaagat rachana-pranali kaa anusaran na karke sarvatha naveen or moulik style ko apanaaya he
 The unique use of poetry and melody has been created through the mixed use of verses, prose and song
 kavi ne katha-sutara ke nirvaah ke liye apekshit drishyayojna athwa avasthaa vishesh ke chithran jaise varnanaatmak prasangon main shlokon kaa prayog kiya he
 Prose has been used in interactive contexts that inform the mood of the characters and expressions of emotion have been expressed in verses
 is prakaar ‘gitgovind’ main apanaayi gayi abhinav rachana-pranali main varna, samvaad or geet paraspar is prakaar gunth gayi hai ki unase ek vilakshan anand kii anubhuti hoti he
 Jaidev, the inventor of this unique composition-style, is his own superior
 radha-krishna kii keli-kathaon tathaa unki abhisar-lilaon kaa rasmay chithran ‘gitgovind’ ko aadhyatmik shringaar kaa manoram granth bana detaa he
 This poetic portrayal of radha-krishna's love of life in various poems of love — hope, despair, excitement, jealousy, anger, honor, resentment, ecstasy, message-sending and union, etc
 — is in this poem
 One does not find anywhere even when searching elsewhere
 shrikrishna ke gopiyon ke saath raas-vilaas ko radha na pasand karti he or na hi sahan kar paati hai
 Radha sends her resentment to Shri Krishna through her sakhi, but that unique praniyani is not satisfied with this much, her loving dependence-heart makes her personally reveal her deep affection towards her beloved
 
 radha ke aane par shrikrishna braj-sundariyon kaa sang chhodkar uski ore unmukh hote hai
 Radha's sakhi is a poignant description of the intense affection of Shri Krishna to Radha and Radha to Sri Krishna with each other and the transcendental pain experienced when they are away from each other
 vah apane komal evam kamaneey vachanon dwaara donon ko ek-duusare se milane ke liye prerit karti he
 Radha, impatient with the pangs of anguish when it is moonlight, is unable to control her incestuous affection and is forced into her expression
 shrikrishna ke aane par ati maan karti hui radha upalambh se bhare vachanon ke dwaara unke prati apana rosh-aakrosh prakat karti he
 Here, Radha's friend requests Radha to leave Maan, while Sri Krishna himself tries to persuade and make him friendly, while praising Radha's beauty and beauty
 antatah radha kaa maan dur ho jaataa he or vah apane kaant se milane ke liye kadamb-kunj main jaati he
 While praying to Shri Krishna Radha there, plead with him to give up shame and inhibition and to cooperate in the rituals
 donon prasann man se rati krida main pravrutt hote hai or iske uparant radha pranaysikt vachanon se apane priyatam shrikrishna se apana shringaar karne ko kahati he
 Giving glory to his pranapriya's request, Shri Krishna gladly adorns Radha with his own hands
 aaj ke kuch aalochak jayadev par bhakthi ke aalamban radha-krishna ko shringaar kaa aalamban banane kaa doshaaropan karte hai, parantu maadhurya bhav ke upaask kavi par yah laanchhan anyaaypurna hi nahin, apitu swayan unke apane avivek kaa dyotak he
 In fact, the expression of extreme elitism of solitude or immersion available in married couples, and the expression of clairvoyance of the imagination of the impenetrable in distinction, creates a sense of melody in the field of devotion
 madhur bhav se bhajan karne vaale bhakton ke liye bhagwaan kii shringarik cheshtaaen, vilaas-lilaayen tathaa prem-gaathaayen hi gey evam kirtaneey hai
 It is worth mentioning here that scholars have accepted all this poetry as an 'unprepared praise', an attempt to express the satire hidden in the talk
 unke mat ke anusaar shrikrishna ‘jeevon kii aatma’ ke pratik hai
 The game of gopis is that type of prapancha, in which the souls of humans trapped in ignorance are wandering
 radha brahmanand kaa pratik he, jise praapt karne par hi jeevatma ko charam sukh kii prapti hoti he
 According to some scholars, Jayadev was not a worshiper of Radha but was a worshiper of Shri Krishna
 atah shrikrishna manushyon kii aatma ke pratik na hokar paramatma ke pratik hai
 Acclaiming this fact, Acharya Baldev Upadhyaya writes - "shringar-shiromani Sri Krishna is the representative of Bhagavat-tattva and his beloved gopikas are the symbol of the creature
 radha-krishna kaa milan jeev-brahm kaa milan he
 In this way, the mystery of many facts of cultivation path is solved here
 ’’ 'gitagovind' is indeed a unique and wonderful book, in which the stream of mysterious melody is flowing in the end of boisterous beauty
 samgr sanskrit sahitya main is koti kii madhur rachana duusari koi nahi
 If you want to observe the culmination of beauty and melody of Sanskrit Bharati, then 'geetagovind' should be followed
 iske shabdachitron se soundarya maano chhalakta he
 The elegance of its songs communicates supernatural melody
 iske chhandon kaa naad-soundarya apurv anand pradaan karata he
 The harmony of words and meanings is so enchanting that even a person unfamiliar with Sanskrit cannot live without being influenced by it
 isaki-si komalkant padaavalee sansar kii kisi bhi bhashaa ke kavy main durlabh he
 Even in long spells used in this poetry, there is unique prasadikta and melody
 anupras ke prayog main to kavi adwitiya he
 The use of alliteration in his songs continues not only at the end of the posts but also in the middle
 lalit chhandon or komalkant padaavalee kaa aisa mani-kanchan sanyog hua he ki geeton ke uccharan maatr se sahrudayon ke hriday main tadnurup ras kaa aavirbhaav evam sanchaar hone lagata he
 This unique style has proved very meaningful for the euphemism of dressing
 ‘gitgovind’ ko badi hi prasiddhi or lokapriyata mili
 The village in which Jaidev lived and composed 'geetgovind', the name of that village became Jaidevpur
 kavi ke samakaleen urisa ke shaasha raja pratap rudradev ne apane rajya ke gayakon, sangitagnon or nartakon ke liye ‘gitgovind’ ke padon ko gane kaa aadesh jari kar diya
 Maharaj honored Jayadev with the title of 'kaviraj Raja' for this poetic composition
 ‘gitgovind’ jayadev ke jivan kaal main hi paryaapt rup se prachlit evam lokapriy ho gaya tha—iske anek pramaan milte hai
 In the south, it became so popular that its verses were carved in the Dravin script on the stairs of the temple of Tirupati Balaji
 shreevallabh sampradaay main to shrimadbhagwat puraana ke samaan isaki pratishtha he
 There is a belief among Vaishnavas that where 'geetagovind' is sung, there is a presence of God
 isi se is sampradaay main ise ayogy sthaan par na gaaye jane kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he, jiskaa kathorta se paalan kiya jaataa he
 In the Vaishnava community, the poet Jayadeva is considered to be the chief noble of the medieval state of this community
 sampradaay main prachlit nimnokt padya ke anusaar jis vaishnav sampradaay ke pravartan vishnu swami ne kiya or jiskaa sanvardhan mahaprabhu vallabhacharya ne kiya, us sampradaay ko in donon mahanubhavon ke madhya main bhakt kavi jayadev ne sangrakshan diya
 In this way Jayadeva is also worshipable as a Guru in the Vaishnava sect
 jayadev ne ‘gitgovind’ kii rachana karke sanskrit main ek naveen rachana-pranali kaa avishkaar kiya
 Many songs such as 'abhinav Geetagovind', 'geetraghava', 'geetagadhar' and 'krishnagit' were composed in Sanskrit on the emulation of 'gitagovind', but no poet was able to bring excellence like 'geetgovind' in his poetry
 idhar hindi main bharatendu harishchandr ne brajabhasha main iske anuwaad kaa prayaas kiya, parantu ‘sachhee kavita’ kaa anuwaad to ho hi nahin saktaa—yah ukti ‘gitgovind’ ke sambandh main aksharshah satya siddh hui he
 The translation of the essence of the original composition in translation is difficult, if not impossible
 sar wiliam jones dwaara angl bhashaa main kiye gayi ‘gitgovind’ kavy ke anuwaad par german kavi gete kii tippanee badi hi sateek he
 'A Real Poetry is that, which cannot be translated
' That is, the basis of identification of excellent poetry is that it cannot be translated into another language
 ‘gitgovind’ ke marm ko samajhane tathaa sahrudayon tak uske soundarya ko sampreshya banane ke liye pantis vidwaanon ke prayaas uplabdh hai, parantu yah kavy to vah agaadh sagar he ki isamen jo jitani gahari dubkee lagaataa he
 Equally rare and precious gems come in his hand
 katipay kaviyon dwaara is kavy ke anukaran par kavy-rachana karnaa jayadev kii kirti-kaumudi kii ujjvalata tathaa utkrushtataa kii sweekruti kaa hi parichaayak he
 The 'geetagovind' poem of devotion, adornment and poetry has another significant significance in krishna-bhakti literature
 yah sarvajan vidit tathy he ki is kavy se purv shrikrishna kii preyasi athwa patni ke rup main rukmini tathaa satyabhama aadi kaa naam hi liya jaataa tha
 There was no existence of a woman named Radha
 shrimadbhagwat puraana main ‘anairadhito nunam’ shrikrishna kii aradhana karne vaali kisi ek gopi kaa ullekh avashya hua he, parantu krishna-kavy main krishna ke saath judane vaali krishna ke hi samakaksh mahatva praapt karne vaali shrikrishna kii premika-patni radha kaa ullekh kahin nahin hua
 'geetagovindakar' Jaidev has the credit for making Radha distinguished at this high place — the exclusive companion of Shri Krishna and integral to him and his eternal strength
 is granth main chitrit radha-krishna ke nity-vilaas ke aadhaar par hi brahmavaivart puraana main radha-krishna kii shringaar-cheshtaaon tathaa kaam-kridaaon kaa varnan hua he, parantu yah ek kathor satya he ki puranakar na to ‘gitgovind’ kavy ke varnan jaisi maryaada or shaleenta kaa nirvaah kar sakaa he or na hi varnan ko vaisaa saras, rochak evam hridaygrahya bana sakaa he
 In this area too, Jaidev is his superior
 is aadhaar par hi kadachit krishna-bhakthi sahitya main ‘gitgovind’ kavy ko dharmagranth kaa gaurav praapt he

 Existentialists give more importance to the existence of a person than to a thought or suffix
 inke anusaar saare vichaar yaa siddhant vyakti kii chintna ke hi parinaam hai
 The first person or person contemplating came into existence, so the person's existence is predominant, while the idea or principle is secondary
 unke vichaar se har vyakti ko apana siddhant swayan khojna yaa bananaa chahie, dusron ke dwaara pratipaadit yaa nirmit siddhanton ko sweekaar karnaa uske liye aavashyak nahin
 Due to this approach, all traditional, social, moral, classical and scientific theories prove to be invalid or impractical for them

 According to the existentialist, grief and depression should be accepted as essential and functional elements of life
 paristhitiyon ko sweekaar karnaa yaa na karnaa vyakti kii hi ichha par nirbhar he
 According to them, a person realizes his condition in a state of grief or tragedy, so he should be present to welcome that situation

 By understanding the basic subject, he wanted to define existentialism and he was successful in it to some extent
 Logos is a Greek word whose pure 'forms are' meaning I
 Logotherapy is based on the existence of a human being and the search for the meaning of man
 On the basis of logotherapy, the pursuit of meaning in life is the first motivating force of a human being
 That is why Frankl has given the importance of life to high importance
 Not Anand

 The beginning of the existential condition comes from sadness
 On this occasion, Frankel makes it clear about 'sunday Neurosis'
 It is a kind of depression in which a person has satisfaction in his life
 He feels the deficiency and realizes this when he feels the loneliness of his life after a week of parting
 Accordingly, the causes of drunkenness and juvenile delinquency cannot be understood until it recognizes the existence of a suppressed existence
 The same applies in the case of old people and pensioners
 These survival laws hold different disguises and life
 Are presented to human beings in different aspects of life
 Some of these may be the desire for power or the desire for money which in search of meaning can be done by man Week tend to blur i are the result of existential frustrations that sexual libido logotherapy kii koshish hameshaa yahi rahati hai ki marijon ko puri tarah se apane kartavya ke taraf modaa jaekai taaki vah yah samaj sake ki ve kiske liye, kis liye or kyon kartavya se bandhe hue handi frankal kaa yah kahana hai ki jivan kaa vaastavik arth swayan ke maanas main nahin balki sansar main handi usee tarah maanav ke astitva kaa asli uddeshy aatm parichay se nahin hotaryi uskaa saar aatm shreshtataa se praapt hoti handi frankal is baat ko nyaay siddh karne ke liye tark yah laate hai ki aatm parichay kabhi bhi jivan kaa aadhaar nahin ban saktaa kyunki maanav jitna use paane kaa praytn karegaa vah utana usko khoyegaqui The world should never understand the manifestation of self, nor is the world the only means to achieve self-introduction
 This implies that the meaning of life is not constant, but it does not have any ends
 Life under logotherapy we Can be found in three ways: through karma; By experiencing the value of one's Vastu; It is very beneficial to complete the first method
 Through pain, there is a need for re-expansion in the second and third ways
 This education can be given to us by nature or by culture or by experiencing someone, ie through love
 Love itself is a shield through which a person's inner personality can be watered
 No one can know a human being or Can understand until love is born
 If love is put in spiritual form, then it can see other important signs of human beings
 Not, the man whom she loves very big step i even more the way of self-introduction, which is confirmed that their power i will go two men recognize their power i teesraa tarika jo manushya ko apane jivan ke arth ko khojane main sahaayta karata hai vah he peedaashi manushya jab bhi asahaay yaa aisi paristhiti se guzarataa he jiskaa parinaam unke haath main na ho jaise: koi laailaaj beemaari, usee vakt ek insaan ko apni pahchaan ko bodh karnaa kaa bharpoor mauka miltaa he, arthath ksht ko jhelkar jivan kaa sabase bada arth paane kaa avasar miltaa handi isamen ksht ki taraf vyakti kaa nazariyaa bhi peeda ko jhelane ki takat detaa haii Frankel, Victor E

 Gravity is the tendency of a material to be attracted towards one another
 gurutvkarshan ke bare main pehali baar koi ganitiya sutara dene kii koshish ijak newton dwaara kii gayi jo ascharyajanak rup se sahi tha
 He proposed the theory of gravity
 newton ke siddhanth ko baad main albert oinstin dwaara saapekshata siddhant se badla gaya
 Earlier Varah Mihir had said that only some kind of power keeps things sticking to the earth
 gurutvkarshan siddhant par aadhunik kaam 16 veen ke ant main or 17 veen shatabdi kii shuruyaat main galileo galili ke kaam se shuru hua
 In his famous experiments used to drop balls from the Tower of Pisa, and later rotate the inclusions with careful measurement of the balls, Galileo showed that the gravitational acceleration is the same for all objects
 yah arestu ke vishwaas se ek bada prasthaan tha ki baari vastuon main ucch gurutvkarshan twaran hota he
 Galileo cited wind resistance as the reason that low-mass objects could fall into the atmosphere at a slower rate
 galileo ke kaam ne newton ke gurutv ke siddhant ke nirmaan ke liye manch taiyaar kiya Then Isaac Newton based on his fundamental discoveries that not only the earth, but every particle of the world keeps attracting every other particle towards itself
 do kanon ke bich kaary karanevaala aakarshan bal un kanon kii sanhatiyon ke gunanfal kaa samaanupati tathaa unke bich kii duuri ke varg kaa vyutkramanupati hota he
 The mutual attraction between the particles acting on gravity and the force generated by it is called the force of gravity
 newton dwaara pratipaadit uparyukt niyam ko newton kaa gurutvkarshan niyam kehete hai
 Sometimes this law is also called the inverse square law of gravity
 uparyukt niyam ko sutara rup main is prakaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : maan liya m1 or sanhati vaale m2 do pind paraspar d duuri par sthit hai
 The relation of the working force f between them will be: yahan g ek samaanupati niyatank he jiskaa maan sabhi padaarthon ke liye ek jaisaa rahata he
 This is called gravity constant
 is niyatank kii vimaa he or aankik maan prayukt ikai par nirbhar karata he
 By the formula, the force of attraction caused by the earth on a body can be calculated
 koi bhi vastu upar se girane par sidhi prithvi kii ore aati he
 It seems as if some untargeted and unknown power is pulling him towards the earth
 italy ke vaigyanik, gallilyyo gallilyaai ne sarvapratham is tathy par prakaash daalaa tha ki koi bhi pind jab upar se girtaa he tab vah ek niyat twaran se prithvi kii ore aata he
 This value of acceleration remains the same for all objects

 Second law - The line joining any planet to the Sun crosses the same area at the same time

 Gravity: "father, this earth, on which we dwell, rests upon?" Lilavati asked this question to her father Bhaskaracharya centuries ago
 iske uttar main bhaskaracharya ne kaha, "baale leelavati !, kuch log jo yah kehete hai ki yah prithvi sheshnag, kachua yaa hathi yaa anya kisi vastu par aadhaarit he to ve galat kehete hai
 Even if it is assumed that it rests on an object, the question remains, on which that object rests, and thus the cause of the cause and then its cause


 This sequence continues, then in jurisprudence This is called non-permanent defect
 leelavati ne kaha phir bhi yah prashn bana rahata he pitaaji ki prithvi kis cheez par tiki he? Then Bhaskaracharya said, why we cannot assume that the earth is not based on anything
 xxrep 5 
 yadi ham yah kahen ki prithvi apane hi bal se tiki he or ise gurutvkarshan shakti kah den to kya dosha he? Lilavati asked how this is possible
 tab bhaskaracharya siddhanth kii baat kehete hai ki vastuon kii shakti badi vicitra he
 Next says arthath prithvi main aakarshan shakti he
 Earth attracts heavy substances with its attraction power and due to attraction they fall to the ground

 Wind mill and water mill etc
 are the initial forms of turbines
 vidyut shakti ke utpaadan main terbinon kaa atyadhik mahatv he
 Gas, steam and water-fired turbines differ from each other
 gas compressure yaa pump bhi terbine jaisaa hi hota he par yah terbine ke ulta kaary karata he
 The turbine has at least one rotor assembly that drives this machine with its shaft or drum with one or more blades
 blade par taral padaarth yaa anya padaarth dabaav daalata he jisase roter yaa ghurni chalati he
 It provides kinetic energy to the rotor and rotor
 gas, bhaap or jal terbine main aamtaur par blade ke aasapaas ek aavaran hota he jo drav kii maatra ko niyantrit karata he
 The term "turbine" was coined in 1822 by French mining engineer Claude Burdine from the Latin turbo word
 iskaa ullekh ek sansmaran main unhone kiya tha jo royal science academy paris ko prastut kiya gaya tha
 Benoit Fornerone, an alumnus of Claude Burdine, built the first practical water turbine

 Normally the degree of reaction and impulse varies at the root of its circumference blade ab agar tarabine kii karypranali kii baat karen to yah newton ke tisare gati niyam ke adhaar par kaam karti he
 That is, on every action, the opposite reaction occurs
 isi tarah tarabine kaa propeller kaam karata he
 The spindle in the propeller exerts pressure on air or water
 isi dabaav kii vajah se propeller tarabine ko peeche kii ore dhakka martha he, jisase vah chalati he
 Usually the turbine is kept in one place, so that whenever the water passes through it, it is driven by the pressure on each blade of the turbine
 The same rule applies with wind or water turbines
 jitna adhik pani yaa hawa kaa pravaah hoga, tarabine utani tej gati se chalegi
 The working fluid consists of pressure energy and kinetic energy
 drav sampidit yaa asampidit kiya ja saktaa he
 Turbines are employed to collect this energy by implantation of several physical principles
 aaveg terbinon main ucch veg taral yaa gas jet ke pravaah kaa upyog roter blade kii disha badalane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The resulting impulse rotates the turbine and the gas or fluid exits at a slower rate

 According to the detailed definition, a gas turbine is the basic conductor in which the working fluid remains in the gaseous state throughout the thermal cycle and whose speed of all the devices is rotating
 sankeern paribhaasha ke anusaar is shabd kaa prayog sirf us mukhya tarabine ang ke liye kiya jaataa he jiskaa madhyam garam vaayu hoti he
 According to some scholars, a gas turbine is a device in which the flow process is continuous and power is obtained by the turbine

 The Act was originally passed in August 1935 and was called the longest Act of Parliament enacted at that time
 isaki lambaai kii vajah se, pratikriya swaroop bharat sarkaar dwaara adhinium 1935 ko ko do alag-alag adhiniyamon main vibhajit kiya gaya: In literature on Indian political and constitutional history, the reference is generally taken to be a shortened form of the Government of India 1935 Act, rather than being enacted originally as a text of the Act
 adhinium ke sabase mahatvapurn pahalu the: However, the degree of autonomy the introduction of the provincial level was subject to significant limitations: the provincial governor retained significant reserve powers and the British authorities also retained the authority to suspend a responsible government
 adhinium ke kuch hisson kii maang bharat sangh ko sthapit karnaa tha lekin rajasi rajyon ke shaskaon ke virodh ke kaaran kabhi sanchaalan main nahin aayaa
 The remaining part of the Act came into force in 1937 when the first elections were held under the Act
 unnisvin sadi ke uttarardh ke baad se bhartiya logon ne apane desh kii sarkaar main lagaataar badi bhoomika kii maang kii
 The contribution of Indians to the British war effort during World War i meant that the more conservative elements of the British political establishment felt the need for constitutional change and the resulting 1919 Act of the Government of India
 The act introduced a neo system of government known as the provincial "dyarchy", that is, the government of some regions was placed in the hands of ministers responsible for the provincial legislature while others were appointed by the British-appointed provincial governor
 Were held in the hands of the officials responsible for
 jabaki adhinium, bharatiyon dwaara sarkaar main ek badi bhoomika nibhaane kii maang kaa ek pratibimb tha, saath hi bharat kii vyavastha main us bhoomika kaa kya matlab ho saktaa he iske bare main british bhay kaa ek pratibimb tha
 Experiments with dyarchy proved unsatisfactory
 bhartiya netaaon ke liye ek vishesh rup se niraashaa yah hi ki un kshetron main jahaan keval nammaatr kaa niyantran unhone praapt kiya tha, lekin "mukhya adhikaar" british naukarshahi ke haathon main hi tha
 It was intended to review India's constitutional arrangements and those princely states that were ready to accept it
 haalanki, samjhaute ko rokane ke liye congress or muslim pratinidhiyon ke bich vibhaajan karnaa mukhya kaarak sabit hua chunki vyavastha main sangh ke kaam karne kii mahatvapurn jaankaree thi
 Against the system, the new Conservative-dominated national government in London decided to come forward with the drafting of its own proposal
 lord linlithgo kii adhyakshata main ek sanyukt sansadeey chayan samiti ne kaaphi had tak white paper kii samiksha kii
 On the basis of this white paper, the Government of India bill was created
 cameti str or baad main kattarta ko shant kiya gaya, "suraksha" ko majboot kiya gaya or kendriya vidhansabha ke liye apratyaksh chunaav kaa punah aayojan kiya gaya
 The bill was duly passed into law in August 1935
 is prakriya kaa ek parinaam yah he ki, haalanki bhartiya maangon ko puraa karne ke liye bharat sarkaar ke 1935 kii adhinium ko thodaa or aage janaa chahie tha, iskaa masauda saamagree main bill kaa bistaar or bhartiya bhagidaari kii kami donon kaa arth tha ki bharat main sarvshereshth nirutsaah pratikriya ke saath adhinium kaa hona jabaki britain main ek mahatvapurn tatv ke liye yah kattarpanthi sabit hui
 Although it became unusual for the Acts of the British Parliament to include the Preamble, the lack of one from the Government of India Act 1935 contrasted with the Act of 1919, which led to the purpose of that Act relating to it for Indian political development
 Established a comprehensive philosophy
 20 agast 1917 ko house of comons ke liye bharat mantri edwin montagu ke vaktavy par aadhaarit 1919 ke adhinium kii prastaavna uddhrut he, jo vaada karti he: 


 is a gradual development of self-governing institution with a philosophy for the progressive presentation of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire
 canada or australia jaise maujuuda dominian ke saath bhartiya maangon main ab british bharat main sanvaidhanik samta ko praapt karnaa tha jiskaa arth tha ki british rashtramandal main sampoorn swaittata
 An important element in the British political circle doubted that Indians were able to run their country on this basis and with sufficient "security", perhaps, the Dominion status as an objective after a long period of gradual constitutional development saw
 unke bich yah tanaav or bhartiya or british ke bheetar drushti ke parinamswaroop 1935 adhinium ke besanga samjhaute ko paaya gaya jisamen isaki koi apni prastaavna nahin thi, lekin 1919 adhinium kii prastaavna ko isaki jagah rakhaa gaya phir bhi us adhinium ke avshesh ko nirast kiya
 It was generally seen in India as more mixed messages from the British, suggesting a defiant attitude on its part and the barest of "minimum essentials" towards satisfying Indian desires
 sabase aadhunik samvidhanon ke vipareet, lekin us samay ke rashtramandal sanvaidhanik kanoon ke saath saamaanya, adhinium ne "adhikaar ke bill" ko nae pranali ke bheetar shaamil nahin kiya jisaki sthapana kaa uddeshy tha
 However, in the proposed case of the Union of India there were some complications involving a set of rights, as the new entity included nominal sovereign princely states
 haalanki kuch logon dwaara ek alag drushtikon ko mana gaya or nehru report main masauda ruparekha samvidhan main bill ke adhikaar ko shaamil kiya gaya
 In 1947, a relatively few amendments to the Act made the Interim Implementation Constitution of India and Pakistan
 adhinium keval atyant vistrut hi nahin tha, lekin yah 'suraksha maanak' ke saath ghira tha, british jimmedaariyon or hiton ko banaae rakhane ke liye jab bhi isaki aavashyaktaa hoti hastkshep karne ke liye british sarkaar ko sakasham banane ke liye dizin kiya gaya tha
 To meet this goal, the Indian government's institutions are gradually increasing in the face of Indianisation, the decision to use the Act and the actual administration of the security measures in the hands of the British appointed Viceroy and the Provincial Governors who are the Secretary of State for India Was under control
 'vishaal shaktiyon or jimmedaariyon jise governor general apane vivek yaa apane vyaktigat nirnay ke anusaar anushaasan karnaa chahie, yah spasht he ki uske ko superman kii tarah ho jane kii ummid hoti he
 He must be endowed with an infinite capacity for humility, courage and hard work
 "we have inserted many safeguards in this bill" Sir Robert Horn said 


 "but all those safeguards are about the same person i think and she is Viceroy
 vah puri vyavastha kii lynch-pin he
 


 if the Viceroy fails, nothing can save your installed system
 " yah bhaashan drudh torij ke drushtakon ko pratibimbit karti he jo ek din lebar government dwaara viceroy kii niyukti hone kii sambhaavna dwaara bhaybheet tha
 a proper reading of the Act shows that the British Government has prepared it for itself, whenever they feel they could take full control of it at any time with the legal tools
 haalanki, bina kisi sateek kaaran ke aisa karnaa bharat ke samooh ke saath unki vishwasaneeyata samaapt ho jaati jinka uddeshy adhinium ko praapt karnaa tha
 Some odd ideas: "sangheey sarkaar main 


 jimmedaar sarkaar kii ek jhalak prastut kiya he
 But there is a lack of reality, as the case lacks the necessary powers in defense and foreign affairs, the Governor General is necessarily given a threshold for ministerial activity and the measure of representation of Indian states is negative and even That there is no possibility of the introduction of democratic control
 ek atyant vishisht sarkaar ke nirmaan ke vikaas ko dekhne ke liye yah atyant ruchi kii vishay hogi; nishchit rup se, agar yah safaltaapurvak sanchalit hota he, sabase adhik credit bhartiya netaaon kii raajnneetik kshamta ko jayega, jinhone aupniveshik rajaneta kii tulana main adhik gambhir kathinaaiyon kaa saamana kiya he jinhone swayan-sarkaar kii pranali ko viksit kiya tha jo ki ab dominian str main paraakaashtha par he
 " lord lothian ne ek pantalis minute ke lambi baatcheet main is bill ke bare main apane vichaar rakhe hai: "I agree with the surrendered Kattaro
 Those who are not used to any constitution cannot realize what great powers they have to use
 yadi aap is samvidhan ko dekhenge to aisa lagegaa ki sabhi shaktiyaan governor general or rajyapal main nihit he
 But here the whole power is not vested in the king? Everything is done in the name of the king, but does the king ever interfere in it? Once power falls into the hands of the legislature, the governor or the governor general never intervene
 


 civil seva madad karti he
 You will also feel it
 Once a policy is set, they will take it forward with loyalty and honesty


 ham isaki madad nahin kar sakate hai
 We had to fight with the cutters here
 aapako ye kabhi ehsaas nahin hoga ki shri baldwin or sar samuel hore dwaara kitna mahaan saahas ko dikhaaya gaya he

 The agents of Bill had a huge difference against them at least as at home as they were in India
 "kanoon apane rajasi samanta main, pulon ke neeche sone, galiyon main bheekh maangane or roti churaane ke liye amir ke saath-saath garibon ko bhi varjit karata he
 " adhinium ke tahat, britain nivasee british naagarik or britain main panjikrut british companiyon ko bhartiya nagarikon or bharat main panjikrut companiyon kii tarah hi bartaav karnaa chahie jab tak britain kanoon parsparik vyavhaar se inkaar karte hai
 The impropriety of this arrangement is evident when the status of British capital in an Indian modern region is given greater prominence and total dominance, the impropriety is maintained through the commercial system, the UK in both India's international and coastal shipping traffic Removal of shipping interests and Indian capital in the UK without value and Indians in shipping within the UK Sector is the non-existence
 isamen viceroy kaa hastkshep karne ke liye kaaphi vistrut praavdhaan kii aavashyaktaa he yadi uske apil-ayogy drushtikon main, koi bhartiya kanoon yaa adhinium kii maang, yaa vastav main, britain nivasee british vishyon ke khilaaf bhedbhaav, british panjikrut companiyon or vishesh rup se, british shipping hiton
 "the Joint Committee considered a suggestion under which trade with foreign countries should be done by the Minister of Commerce, but it is decided that all negotiations with foreign countries should be conducted by the Foreign Office or Department of Foreign Affairs as they are in Britain Huh

 yah sach ho saktaa he, lekin swayan saadrishy hi galat he
 In the United Kingdom the two departments are subject to analogy control while in India one is responsible for the federal legislature and the other for the Imperial Parliament
 " From the moment of the Montagu statement of 1917, it was important to remain in the stage of the reform process if the British were to organize a strategic initiative
 haalanki, british raajnneetik cirkil main samrajyavaadee bhaavana or yatharthwaad kii kami ne ise asambhav bana diya
 Thus the involuntary conditional concessions of power in the Acts of 1919 and 1935 caused more dissatisfaction and failed to win the rule of influential groups in India which were desperately needed
 1919 main 1935 ke adhinium, yaa simon kamishan yojana kaaphi safal hui thi
 There is evidence that Montagu is supported in a similar way but his cabinet colleagues did not consider it
 1935 tak ek samvidhan bharat ke dominian ko sthapit kiya, british bhartiya praanton jisamen bharat main sweekaarya gaya ho saktaa he haalanki yah british sansad ko paarit nahin karegaa
 'at that time the balance of power in the conservative party was considered, the enactment passed in 1935 was unthinkable compared to passing the bill
 ' The provincial part of the Act which was automatically enacted originally followed the agreement of the Simon Commission

 The British were appointed provincial governors, who were responsible to the British government through the Viceroy and the Secretary of State for India and accepted the recommendations of the ministers, in their view they were negatively affecting their legislative territory, one Were taking special responsibility like preventing any serious crisis for the peace or tranquility of the province and for the legitimate interests of minorities

 1939 main congress prantiy mantralayon ke istife ke baad rajyapal yuddh tak purv-congress vaale praanton main sidhe shashan kiya tha
 It was generally accepted that the provincial part of the Act conferred a great deal of powers upon the provincial leaders as long as the British officers and Indian leaders acted under the rules
 However, intervention by the British governor intensified the paternal threat was done
 adhinium ke prantiy bhaag ke vipareet, jab vajan se aadhe rajyon ko sanstha main sammilit karne par sahmati hui tab sangheey hisse ko prabhaav main laayaa jaataa

 Over a very long period, conservative leadership expected nominal dominance status for India from the act, the outlook was dominated by orthodox Hindu alliances and right-wing Hindu alliances which kept themselves prone under the direction and protection of Britain 
 madhyam avadhi main, adhinium se ummid thi : This was accomplished by over-representation of kings, giving each potential minority, the right to vote separately to their respective community of voters, and by removing the executive theoretically, but not practically, by the legislature

 ' (4 farvari 1935 ko bhartiya sanvaidhanik sudhaar par sanyukt sansadeey cameti main boolabhai desai kii report
 However, elements in the Liberals and the Congress were also ready to let it go with a dullness: "linlithgo ne sapru se poocha ki kya usne sochaa ki adhinium 1935 kii is yojana main ek santoshjanak vikalp tha
 Sapru said that they should implement the Act fast and the federal plan is embedded in it
 yah koi adarsh nahin tha, lekin is str par yah ekmaatr he
 


 a few days later Sapru came to Birla to meet the Viceroy
 usne sochaa ki congress sangh kii sweekruti kii ore bad rahaa tha
 Birla said that Gandhi was not much concerned about this through reservation for the Center for Defense and Foreign Affairs but was looking at how to choose the representatives of the states

 Linlithgow was quite intelligent, extremely diligent, honest, serious, and determined to make the act a success, though he was also unassuming, impassioned, lawful and felt very difficult to "enforce terms" with people outside his immediate circle

 1937 main, takaraav ke ek bade saude ke baad, prantiy swaittata ko shuru kiya gaya
 From that point until the declaration of war in 1939, Linlithgow tried its best to unite with the kings to initiate the Confederacy
 is main unhone gharelu sarkaar se kaaphi kam sahyog praapt kiya or antat raajaaon ne federation en maase ko khaarij kar diya
 In September 1939, Linlithgow announced in general that India had gone to war with Germany
 haalanki linlithgo kaa vyavhaar sanvaidhanik rup se sahi tha saath hi bhartiya vichaaron ke liye yah kaaphi aakraamak tha
 This led to the slight resignation of the provincial ministries of the Congress which weakened Indian unity
