 Mechanical transmission of power is by shaft with the help of a strap or rope, or with the help of mechanics and chains
 paristhiti ke anusaar shakti ko sanchaarit karne ke liye ye tareeke alag alag, yaa ek duusare ke saath, vyavahrut kiye jate hai
 According to the original conductor, mechanical devices of power transmission are designed and manufactured
 mul chaalak ke gatipalak chakra par lage hue patte dwaara, shakti ko rekha shift main sanchaarit kiya jaataa he
 The pulleys are fixed according to the design on the line shaft
 un ghiraniyon par lage hue patte dwaara shakti ko rekhashaft se vibhinn yantron main sanchaarit kiya jaataa he
 The biggest drawback in this type of system is that all the devices, which transmit power from the lineshaft, become unusable as soon as the lineshaft stops running due to any reason
 is prakaar ke shaktisancharan kaa maatraatmak vishleshan karne ke liye ingine ke crank sheft ko sancharan kaa aarambh bindu evam yantra ke pratham gatiman shift ko sancharan kaa antim bindu maan liya jaataa he
 This approximation is appropriate for the specific yatra
 maan liya ki ingine kii gati n parikraman prati minute he
 Running at this speed, the engine continuously exerts force on the crankshaft
 maan liya ki bal adhurna kii maatra t kilogram prati meter he
 In this case the angular speed w of the engine will be 2 x pi x n / 60
 yahan w kii ikai radian prati second he
 Thus the rate of work done by the engine crank shaft is wt kg per meter per second
 suvidha ke liye maan liya, crank shift se praapt sampurna shakti ek hi yantra ko sancharit hoti he
 Assuming the momentary force exerted on that device is T1 kg per meter and w1 radian per second is the angular speed of the device, then the rate of energy received by that device will be w1t1 kilogram meter per second
 gharshan evam anya avarodhon ko abhibhoot karne ke liye urja kaa kuch ansh sancharanyantr dwaara avashoshit hota he
 If not, the rate of energy absorption by the device will be equivalent to the rate of energy generated by the original conductor
 kintu vyavhaar main aisa nahin hota he
 When a shaft transmits power to an instrument from the original conductor, each section of it faces a force
 yadi balaghurna kii maatra t kilogram prati meter ho tathaa shift w radian prati second ke koniya gati se gum rahaa ho, to sancharan kii dar wt kilogram meter prati second hogi
 While designing the shaft, its size and magnitude have to be ascertained
 is sambandh main yah dhyaan diya jaataa he ki balaghurna dwaara utpann pratibal ek vishisht seemaa ke andar hi rahe
 The shaft is sometimes also designed on the basis that the relative angular displacement of two sections perpendicular to the axis of the shaft is less than a specific angle
 vibhinn akaarawale shift ke liye vibhinn sameekaran nigamit kiye jate hai or unka prayog dizin banane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 As mentioned above, it is generally assumed that the torsion will be uniform, but in fact the torsion value always changes, it is not able to remain the same
 parivartit avasthaaon ke liye aparupak pratibal kaa maan usee ke anusaar chunaa jaataa he
 Apart from these oddities, one more thing to note is that no shaft has to face not only torsion, but also torsion as well as bunken moment
 is tarah vastav main shift kaa dizin bananaa utana saral nahin he jitna lagata he
 While making the design of the shaft, all these inequalities have to be kept in mind and its magnitude has to be valued according to location
 kabhi-kabhi ek hi shift se vibhinn yantron ko shakti preshit kii jaati he
 Such instruments are installed at different places and all these instruments get power from different parts of the shaft
 shaktisancharan kii is avasthaa main swabhaavat: mul chaalak ke nikatatam shift ke bhaag ko sampurna shakti sanchaarit kerani hoti he evam jyon-jyon anya yantra shift ke vibhinn bhaagon se shakti praapt karte jate hai, tyon-tyon shift dwaara sancharit shakti kam hoti jaati he
 Therefore, the magnitude of the power of the part of the shaft closest to the original conductor will be maximum and the magnitude of the power will also decrease according to the distance of different parts of the shaft
 ek shift se duusare shift ko shakti sanchaaran karne ke liye dantichakra kaa vyavhaar hota he
 Two shafts are placed in parallel, or bent at some angle from each other
 pratham avasthaavale chakra spor gear tathaa duusari avasthaavale chakra bewel gear kehalaate hai
 Gears are often designed for constant speed ratios, but sometimes gears are also designed based on variable speed estimates for specific instruments
 shift kii tarah dantichakra kaa pariman bhi balaghurna par nirbhar karata he
 The dentistry for power transmission is used in these locations, such as in a ship, in a high speed steam turbine, in a low speed propellant, and in a motorized gear box
 dantichakra kaa nirmaan karte samay vishesh dhyaan dene yogya baat yah he ki antaraal kii ek samanta atyadhik shuddhta se praapt ho
 If the interval is not uniform, then there will be excessive clamor at high speed by denticles, which is undesirable
 at: aadhunik pravidhi main dantichakron ko kathor banaakar sookshm peshanchakki dwaara yatharth antaraal or aakaar main peshit kiya jaataa he
 It is also commonly practiced in Shaktikaran
 iske liye do ghiraniyon par patte ko chadhaaya jaataa he
 When the pulley rotates at the same speed, the power is transmitted from one pulley to another
 is avasthaa main patta ek taraf kadaa rahata he or duusari taraf dhilaa, kintu donon taraf tanaav kii hi sthiti rahati he
 The location of the chain is also important in power transmission devices
 iske mukhya gun ye hai : The different types of chains that come into practice are the main ones: viyojya, aghatvardhaneey louh shrunkhlaa - is prakaar kii shrunkhlaa aghatvardhaneey lohe kii kadiyon ko jodakar banaai jaati he
 Its design is designed in such a way that there is convenience in combination
 is prakaar kii shrunkhlaa kaa vyavhaar adhiktar 40 ghurna prati minute evam gati anupaat 5 or 1 kii avasthaa main hota he, Steel Cylinder Series - The first type of chain is capable of following
 aadhunik yug ucch gati kaa yug he
 Therefore, in order to transmit power at high speeds, the steel chain is of light texture and the gaps are kept very accurate
 iske nirmaan main madhyam-carbon-ooshmabellit ispaat kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 This chain is transported in a state of 700 revolutions per minute and up to 5 speed ratios, neerav shrunkhlaa - shaktipreshan ke liye nirmit shrunkhalaaon main iskaa sthaan adhik mahatvapurn he
 It is used to transmit high power at high speeds
 isaki kadiyon kaa dizine or nirmaan atyant saavdhaneepurvak evam vishisht vidhiyon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 This type of chain is mainly treated for 1,200 to 1,500 rotations per minute and 15 speed ratio
 bahut pehle shaktipreshan ke liye rajju kaa vyavhaar bhi kiya jaataa tha
 The power is transmitted by wrapping the rope on the groove made on the perimeter of the pulley
 chunki rajju patte kii tulana main kam namya he, isliye yah dhyaan dena chahie ki rajju ke vyas kii apeksha kam vyasavaali ghirani se rajju ke vyas kii apeksha kam vyasavaali ghirani se rajju dwaara shakti preshit kii jaae
 The working force of the rope is very low compared to the strap, but the ratio of tension force is very high
 vigyaan ke kaaran aadhunik yug main alp shaktivaale mul chaalak kaa, jiske nirmaan main kam kharch kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, nirmaan ho rahaa he, kintu is mul chaalak kii dakshata adhik hoti he
 In addition, these methods are prominent in the methods of mechanical transmittance: pratyaksh motor yugmit sambandh - isamen motor or shakti praapt karne vaala shift ek duusare se yugman dwaara sambandhit rahete hai
 This coupling is often flexible
 is tarah kaa sambandh sanhat rahata he tathaa is yugman kaa upyog aadhunik yantron ko chalaane ke liye kiya jaataa he; Direct motor leash connection - There is a strap between the motor and the receiving shaft
 iskaa vyavhaar vibhinn yantric upkarnon ko chalaane main kiya jaataa he
 The chain is also used elsewhere in place of lease; patta or rekha shift - is vidhi kaa vivaran upar diya ja chukaa he; Gear Reduction System - The electric motor often operates at high speed, but the power receiving shaft of the equipment has to operate only at low speed
 swabhaavat: motor or shift kaa pratyaksh sambandh kar dene se shift bhi usee ucch gati par chalanaa aarambh karegaa
 Therefore, speed reduction is required to transmit power from the motor to the shaft and this work is done by mechanical reduction system
 is pranali dwaara 50 or 1 ke anupaat evam kabhi kabhi to 100 or 1 ke anupaat main bhi shakti kaa newnikaran ho saktaa he; Multi-strand rope system - The propagation of this system has started recently
 rajju angreji akshar ve ke aakaar ke bane hote hai or chakron kii parima par banaae gaye ve aakaar ke khaanche par kaary karte hai
 This system is capable of direct operation of any type of device and parivarti gati sambandh - vibhinn prakaar ke audyogic pravidhiyon main is tarah ke sambandh kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 In this, the change of pace is done smoothly and without any hindrance
 kabhi-kabhi sthaan ke abhaav main upar bataai gai pranaaliyon main se kuch ke sanyog kaa vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 Compacting is more important in modern methods, as well as more efficiency can be achieved by these methods and the overall expenditure is also less
 shaktipreshan kii vidhiyon main dravchaalit pranali sabase aadhunik he
 In a hydraulic system, power is transmitted with the help of a liquid
 yah taral bahudhaa tel hota he, kintu kabhi kabhi jal kaa bhi vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 a fluidized system can be divided into two departments: gas parivarti preshan ko upyog main laane ke liye anekanek praytn kiye ja rahe hai
 The main use of this method is more in trains
 abhi bhi is kshetra main anusandhan ho rahe hai, kyonki in vidhiyon kii dakshata bahut hi kam he
 It is hoped that in the near future, investigators can be successful in their experiment and the utility of this system will increase even more in other areas

 In this contribution two stories have special importance due to their interestingness
 ashok ke putr kunal kii karun katha baudhdhyug kii romaanchak kathaon main badi prakhyat he
 Taking the form of Buddha and praying to Mara Acharya Upagupta for education is a very interesting story, heartbreaking like a drama

 The Kalpadrumavadanamala appears to be the oldest of the texts dependent on "avadanashakta"

 The term design or design is used in applied arts, engineering, architecture and other similar creative works and fields
 ise kriya ke rup main evam sangya ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Design as an action refers to the process that is adopted to bring or develop a product, structure, system or goods
 sangya ke rup main dizin shabd do arthon main prayukt hota he- Nowadays, processes are also considered to be the result of design
 is arth main prakriya kii dizin kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Many goals are set under the design
 inamen pramukh aavashyaktaayen hai - kaary sambandhi, aakaar va aaytan sambandhi, mulya yaa laagat sambandhi, shakti kii aavashyaktaa sambandhi, rakrakhaav tathaa bigadne par sudhaar sambandhi, vibhinn bhaagon ko aapas main jodne main aasaani sambandhi, nirmaan evam utpaan main saralata aadi
 Design For the achievement of a predetermined goal, it is the 'design' to systematically organize the ideas and all the other related items
 vaastuvid kisi bhawan ke nirmaan kii yojana banaate hue rekhaon kaa vibhinn roopon main ankan kisi ek lakshya kii purti ko sochakar karata he
 The artist also tries to present a special effect or idea in the picture by combining lines
 isi prakaar imarti ejeeniyar kisi imaarat main sunishchit tikaaupan or dridhtaa laane ke liye uski vividh maapon ko niyat karata he
 All things are under design
 vaastuvid kaa kartavya he ki vah aisa vyavhaarya abhiklpana prastut kare jo bhavannirmaan kii lakshyapurti main suvidhajanak evam mitavyayi ho
 At the same time, he should also keep in mind that the size of the building should be compatible with the neighborhood of that area and can also match with the old buildings standing around Eid
 maan lijie, id-gird ke sabhi makaan mehrabadar daravajevaale hai, to unke bich ek sapaat daat ke daron kaa, sade dhang ke samnevaala makaan shobhaa nahin degaa
 Similarly, there are many other things which should be considered keeping in view the lateral environment
 duusari vishesh baat jo vaastuvid ke liye vichaarneey he, vah he bhawan ke bahari aakaar ke vishay main ek sthir mat kaa nirnay
 It should be such that even a person walking on the road should understand the building without asking what it is built for
 jaise, ek kalege ko aspataal sareekha nahin laganaa chahie or na hi aspataal kii akruti kalege sareekhee honi chahie
 The bunk building should look sturdy and safe and the exterior of the playhouse or cinema hall should be adorable
 vaastuvid ko yah sunishchit hona chahie ki usne us puure kshetra kaa bharpoor upyog kiya he jisapar use bhawan nirmit karnaa he
 Artistic designs also include painting of curtains for entertainment or theater, various types of paintings for decoration, making graffiti to express a particular idea
 kalakaar kii khubi isi main he ki vah apni abhiklpana ko yatharth aakaar de
 The painting should symbolize the living expression of the artist's thoughts
 chitra kii aavashyaktaa ke anusaar kalakaar pencil ke rekhachitr, tailchitr, pani ke rangon ke chitra aadi banaae
 The engineer of the buildings has to make his design according to the design of the architect so that the building is strong enough to handle all the loads falling on it

 For this, it is also necessary to keep in mind whether the specific materials recommended for manufacture are available in the market, or whether there is a lack of the desired efficiency to implement the suggested specific work styles
 bhaar kaa anumaan karne main swayan imaarat kaa bhaar, banate samay yaa uske upyog main aane par uskaa chal bhaar, chal bhaaron ke aghat kaa prabhaav, hawa kii daab, bukamp ke dhakkon kaa parinaam, taap, sankoch, neenv ke baithne aadi anek baton ko dhyaan main rakhana padataa he
 Some of these weights can be calculated finely, but there are many that can only be estimated based on past experiences
 jaise bukamp ke bal ko len---iskaa anumaan bada kathin he or is baat kii koi purvakalpana nahin ho sakati ki bukamp kitne bal kaa or kahan par hoga
 However, luckily, the effect of most moving and fixed weights can be calculated quite accurately
 taap evam sankochajanit daabon kaa bhi paryaapt sahi anumaan puure rituchakra ke tapon main hone vaale vyatikramon ke adhyayan tathaa kancreet ke gyaat gunon dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 The forces due to wind and earthquake are ultimately uncertain, but there is usually no loss due to a slight error in their estimation of the quantity
 nirmansaamagree saadhaarant: itani pusht lagaai jaati he ki daab aadi balon main 33 pratishat vruddhi hone par bhi kisi prakaar kii haani kii ashanka na rahe
 a good estimate of sinking of the foundation is made by a proper examination of the soil below
 prayek abhikalpak ko kuch agyaat tathyon ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana hota he, yatha kaarigaren kii aakshamata, kisi samay logon kii akalpit bheed kaa bhaar, istemaal main laae gaye padaarthon kii chhipi sambhavya kamajoriyaan ityadi
 These facts are placed under the 'safety factor', which is assumed to be 2 to 1 / 2 for steel and 3 to 4 for concrete, timber and other equipment
 surakshagunak ko bhawan par atirikt bhaar ladane kaa bahaanaa nahin bananaa chahie
 This is only for unknown reasons and even to a lesser extent, which can prove to be helpful in the future to bear the brunt of the building, disrepair and weather uncertainties
