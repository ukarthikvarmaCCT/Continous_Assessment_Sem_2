 Money cannot be taken for free software
 yadi software ke liye paisa nahin milegaa to kaam kaise chalegaa| tab vyapaaree varg ko aisa laga ki free software bekaar he or unhone ise apane se bahut dur rakhaa
 Although money can also be earned from free software, but its method is somewhat different, but there was such a stampede on the free software that the business class started shying away from adopting those other methods too
 1997 main free software main utsaahi logon ne san-francisco main ek meeting kii tathaa open sorce inishiative naam kii saarvajanik karporation banaayi
 Ten guiding principles were created in it

 open sorce software licenson main yah sabase lokapriy bhi he
 At the other end is Barkley Software Distribution

 The rest of the marked licenses are in between these two edges and copyleft the software to different levels

 isaki vristit charchaa to phir kabhi karenge par abhi to keval itnaa hi ki unics ke adhiktar rup open sorce saftware hai

 There is a difference between the two, but the relationship is also deep
 free software se hi yah sab shuru hua he isaliye aise software ko Free Open Source Software yaa chote main FOSS kaha jaataa he
 Here the word free means freedom, but the word free also means without money, so the use of the word free puts you in some circles
 french bhashaa main do alag-alag shabd handghretis jiskaa arth bina paise ke hota hameibre jiskaa arth swatantraaa se hota he isaliye log aksar Free / Libre Open Source Software yaa FLOSS kaa prayog karte hai LAMP: There are four main pillars of open source software: linuxappachemysqlpython, Perl, PHP etc

 linus torwaldas, jo linaks ke janmdata hai, ne apni jeevani david dimond ke saath likhi he
 Its name is 'just for Fun: the Story of an Accidental Revolutionary'
 This is a very good book and reading it motivates us to move forward in life
 He says about open source software in this book, ‘the GPL and open source model allows for the creation of the best technology
 


 It also prevents the hoarding of technology and ensures that anyone with interest won’t be excluded from its development
 


 So open source would rather use the legal weapon of copyright as an invitation to join in the fun, rather than as a weapon against others
 It's still the same old mantra: Make Love, Not War, except on a slightly more abstract level
 


 Imagine an intellectual property law that actually took other people’s rights into account, too
 Imagine IP laws that encouraged openness and sharing
 Laws that say sure, you can still have your secrets, whether they be technological or religious, but that doesn’t mandate legal protection for such secrecy
’ When we are talking about some benefits in open software, it would be very good to see some other side too
 Bill Gates is the father of Windows
 unhone ‘the Road Ahead’ pustak likhi he
 This book is also very good

 In this, they describe the shortcomings of free software in this way, 'in addition to free information, there's a lot of free software on the Internet today, some of it quite useful
 Sometimes it's commercial software given away as part of a marketing campaign
 Other times the software has been written as a graduate student project or at a government-funded lab
 But i think consumer desire for quality, support, and comprehensiveness in important software applications means that the demand for commercial software will continue to grow
 Already many of the students and faculty members who wrote free software at their universities are busy writing business plans for start-up companies that will provide commercial versions of their software with more features, not to mention customer support and maintenance
' It is difficult to say which way the software industry will go but many countries and business houses of the world are making open source software their part
 ham is samay ek doraahe par khadey hai or ek aisi sthiti main hai ki soochna pradyogiki ko nayaa mode de sakate hai
 We are not short of engineers of information technology

 The name was coined in the scientific discussion of Alfred Wegener's theory of continental flow
 apni pustak "da origin of continents and oshans" main unhone mana tha ki sabhi mahadweep baad main vikhandit hone or pravaahit hokar apane vartmaan sthanon par pahunchne se pehle ek samay main ek vishaal mahadweep kaa hissaa the jise unhone "uracontinent" kaha tha
 The term Pangea came to light in 1928 during a symposium held to discuss Alfred Wegener's theory
 ek vishaal mahaasaagar jo panzia ko chaaron ore se ghere hue tha, tadnusaar uskaa naam panthalasa rakhaa gaya
 It seems that the fragmentation and origin of the vast continents is consecutive in the history of the Earth's 4
6 billion years
 panzia se pehle kai anya nirmaan bhi hue ho sakate hai
 Last to second, Panotia was formed 600 million years ago during the Proterozoic Eoin and existed until 540 ma
 panotia se pehle rodenia astitv main tha jo lagbhag 1
1 billian varshon pehle se lekar 750 million varshon pehle tak maujuud rahaa tha
 Rhodinia was formed by the deposition and joining of fragments resulting from the fragmentation of an old massive continent called Columbia or Nuna, built in the period 2
0–1
8 GA
 rodenia ke sateek vinyas or jeeyodynamiks itihaas ko utani behatar tareeke se nahin samajha gaya he jitna panotia or panzia ko
jab rodenia kaa vikhandan hua to yah teen tukdon main bant gaya: proto-loresia kaa vishaal mahadweep, proto-gondvanaa kaa vishaal mahadweep or apekshaakrit chota congou creton
 proto-loresia or proto-gondvanaland ko proto-tethis mahaasaagar ne alag-alag kar diya tha
 Laurentia, Siberia and the Baltic continents were formed soon after proto-laurentia itself split and separated
 isaki daraar se do nae mahasaagaron, ipitas mahaasaagar or pelioasian mahaasaagar kaa bhi nirmaan hua
 The Baltic was located east of Laurentia and north-east of Siberia Laurentia
 600 eme ke aasapaas in mahasaagaron main se zyaadaatar ne waapas ek saath milakar ek apekshaakrit alpaayu vishaal mahadweep panotia kaa nirmaan kiya jisamen dhruvon ke paas badi maatra main jameen or bumadhya rekha ke paas dhruviya mahasaagaron ko jodne vaali sirf ek apekshaakrit choti pattee shaamil thi
 Only 6040 years after its origin, about 540 ma, near the beginning of the Cambrian era Panotia disintegrated, giving rise to the southern continent of Laurentia, the Baltic, and Gondwana
 cambrian kaal main laurenshia kaa swatantra mahadweep, jo uttari america bana, yah teen ore se ghire simaankit mahasaagaron ke saath bumadhya rekha par sthit ho gaya: uttar or pashchim main panthalasik mahaasaagar, dakshin main ipitas mahaasaagar or purv main khantee mahaasaagar
 pracheenatam ordovisian main 480 eme ke aasapaas evalonia kaa chota mahadweep, ek jameen kaa hissaa jo purvottar sanyukt rajya america, nova scotia or england bana, gondvanaa se mukt ho gaya or isane laurenshia kii ore apana safar shuru kar diya
 The Baltic, Laurentia, and Avalonia all united together by the end of the Ordovician period, thus forming a small continent near the Iapetus Ocean called Euramerica or Laurecia
 takkar ke parinaam swaroop uttari epalachiyans kii bhi utpatti hui
 siberia do mahadwipon ke bich khantee mahaasaagar ke saath uramerica ke nikat sthit ho gaya
 When all these incidents were happening, Gondwana slowly slipped towards the South Pole
 yah panzia kii utpatti kaa pehla charan tha
 The second phase of Pangea's genesis was Euramerica's collision with Gondwana
 By the Silurian period, 440 MA, the Baltic had already collided with Laurentia to form Euramerica
 evalonia abhi tak laurenshia se nahin takaraayaa tha or unke bich ek samudri maarg, ipitas mahaasaagar kaa ek avshesh abhi tak sikud rahaa tha kyonki evalonia dhire-dhire laurenshia kii ore khisakane laga tha
 Meanwhile southern Europe fragmented from Gondwana and the newly formed rake began to move across the ocean towards Euramerica and collided with the southern Baltic in the Devonian, although this small continent was in the form of an underwater strip
 ipitas mahaasaagar kii shakha khantee mahaasaagar bhi siberia se ek dweepiya vrutt ke rup main sikud rahaa tha jo purvi baltic se takaraa gaya
 a new ocean, the Ural Ocean, was present behind this island
 silurian kaal ke ant main uttar or dakshin china gondvanaa se dur chale gaye or sikudte hue proto-tethis mahaasaagar ke paar uttar kii ore badhanaa shuru kar diya or iske dakshini sire par nayaa peleo-tethis mahaasaagar khul rahaa tha
 In the Devonian period, Gondwana itself started moving towards Euramerica, causing the Rake Ocean to shrink
 praarambhik carbonipheras yug main uttar-pashchim africa ne uramerica ke dakshin-purvi tat ko chhu liya tha jisase epalchian parvaton or messeta parvaton ke dakshini hisson kaa nirmaan hona shuru ho gaya tha
 South America moved northward towards southern Euramerica while the eastern parts of Gondwana started moving from the equator to the south pole
 uttari china or dakshini china swatantra mahadwipon par sthit the
 The small continent Kazakhstania collided with Siberia in the Middle Carboniferous era
 pashchimi kazakhstania carbonipheras yug ke ant main baltic se takaraayaa jisase unke bich ural mahaasaagar kaa sampark band ho gaya karne or unamem pashchimi proto-tethis ural parvaton or vishaal mahadweep loresia kii utpatti kaa kaaran bana
 yah panzia kii utpatti kaa antim charan tha
 Meanwhile, South America collided with southern Laurentia, closing the rake ocean and forming the southernmost part of the Appalachians and Ouachita Mountains
 is samay tak gondvanaa dakshini dhruv ke paas sthit ho gaya tha or antarctic, bharat, australia, dakshin africa or dakshin america main glaciaron kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 Part of northern China had collided with Siberia by the end of the Carboniferous era and thus the proto-tethys Ocean was completely closed
 parmian yug kii shuruyaat main cimerian plate gondvanaa se vikhandit hokar alag ho gayi or yah loresia kii ore badhane lagi jisase iske dakshini sire par ek nayaa mahaasaagar, tethis mahaasaagar nirmit ho gaya or plato-tethis mahaasaagar kaa rasta band ho gaya
 Most of the terrain was still integrated
 trysic kaal main panzia thodaa sa dakshin-pashchim disha main gum gaya tha
 The Cimmerian plate was still crossing the shrinking paleo-tethys which continued until the middle of the Jurassic period
 The paleo-tethys was closed from west to east, thus creating the Cimmerian Orogeny
 panzia angreji ke "si " akshar kii tarah dikhaai detaa tha jisamen si ke andar ek mahaasaagar, nayaa tethis mahaasaagar maujuud tha
 Pangea had cracked by the middle of the Jurassic period, its fragmentation is given below
 panzia ke jeevashm-pramaan main mahadwipon par paayi jane vaali ek jaisi or abhinn prajatiyon kii maujuudagi shaamil he jo ab kaaphi dur chale gaye hai
 For example, fossils of therapsid Listerosaurus are found in South Africa, India and Australia, along with members of the Glossopteris flora that would have extended from the polar circle to the equator if the continents had been in their current positions; Similarly, the freshwater reptile Mizosaurus is found only in the local areas of the coasts of Brazil and West Africa
 panzia ke atirikt pramaan dakshin america ke purvi tat or africa ke pashchimi tat ke bich bhuvaigyanik rujhaanon ke milan sahit isse sate mahadwipon ke bhugarbha main paae jate hai
 The polar ice layer of the Carboniferous period covered the southern end of Pangea
 visheshkar ek hi yug tak kii himandiyon ke sangrah or sanrachanaayen kai alag mahadwipon par paayi jaati hai jo panzia mahadweep main ek saath rahe honge
 Paleomagnetic studies of apparent pathways of polar aberration also support the theory of giant-continent
 bhuvaigyanik chattaanon main chumbakeey khanijon ke unmukhikaran kaa pareekshan kar mahadwipiya platon kii halchal ko nirdhaarit kar sakate hai; jab chattaanon kaa nirmaan hota he, ve prithvi ke chumbakeey gunon ko apane andar samahit kar lete hai or yah sanket dete hai ki chattan ke saapeksh dhruv kis disha main maujuud hai
 Since the magnetic poles tilt toward recurring poles occur only over a period of a few thousand years, measurements are averaged over several lavas of several thousand years to determine a clear average polarity position
 talchhati chattaanon or ghuspaithi aagney chattaanon ke namoonon main ek chumbakeey jhukaav hota he jo aam taur par chumbakeey uttar ke jhukaav main in 'ek saamaan badlaavon' kaa ek ausat hota he kyonki unke chumbakeey kshetra turant nahin ban jate hai jaisaa ki thande ho rahe lava ke maamle main hota he
 The magnetic variations between sample groups that have a difference of millions of years in age are due to a combined real polarity deviation and movement of continents
 vaastavik dhruviya vichlan ke ghatak sabhi namoonon ke liye samaan hote hai or inhen hataaya ja saktaa he
 This gives geologists a part of this drift that shows continental stirring and can be used to help redefine earlier continental conditions
 parvat shrinkhalaaon kii nirantarata bhi panzia ke liye sakshya uplabdh karaate hai
 An example of this is the Appalachian mountain range that extends from the northeastern United States to the Caledonides of Ireland, Britain, Greenland, and Scandinavia
 panzia ke vikhandan ke teen pramukh charan the
 The first phase began in the Early – Middle Jurassic period when Pangea began to diverge from the Tethys Ocean in the east and the Pacific Ocean in the west, eventually leading to the development of the vast continents Lauresia and Gondwana
 jo daraar uttari america or africa ke bich bananaa shuru hua tha usne kai asafal daraaron ko janm diya
 ek daraar ke parinaam swaroop nae mahaasaagar, uttar atlantic mahaasaagar kaa nirmaan hua
 The Atlantic Ocean was not uniformly open; Rifts began to form in the north-central Atlantic
 dakshin atlantic kriteshs tak nahin khulaa tha
 Lauresia started moving clockwise, it moved north to North America and south to Eurasia
 loresia ke ghadi kii disha main badhane se tethis mahaasaagar kaa rasta bhi band ho gaya
 In the meantime a new rift had also begun to form on the other side of Africa with the adjacent margins of East Africa, Antarctica and Madagascar leading to the creation of the southwestern Indian Ocean, also opening up in the Cretaceous
 panzia ke vikhandan kaa doosraa mahatvapurn charan praarambhik criteshas kaal main shuru hua jab chota vishaal mahadweep gondvanaa anekon mahadwipon main alag-alag vibhakt ho gaya
 Around 200 MA, the Simaria continent collided with Eurasia as described above
 However, a subduction zone was created when Cimaria collided
 is sabadakshan kshetra ko tethian trench kaha gaya tha
 This sea trench was probably subducted as the Tethyan mid-ocean Ridge, this ridge responsible for the expansion of the Tethys Ocean
 yah sambhawatah africa, bharat or australia ke uttar kii ore badhane kaa kaaran bana tha
 In the early Cretaceous period, the Atlantic, which is today's South America and Africa, was eventually separated from eastern Gondwana, opening the way to the "south Indian Ocean"
 madhya kriteshs kaal main gondvanaa ne vikhandit hokar dakshin atlantic mahaasaagar kaa maarg khol diya tha kyonki dakshin america ne africa se dur pashchim kii ore badhanaa shuru kar diya tha
 The South Atlantic was not uniformly developed; Rather it formed as a crack from north to south
 iske alaava usee dauraan madagascar or bharat antarctic se alag hone lage the or uttar kii ore badhane lage the, jisase hind mahaasaagar kaa rasta khul gaya tha
 Madagascar and India separated from each other in the 100–90 MA at the end of the Cretaceous period
 bharat 15 centimetre prati varsh kii gati se uresia kii ore uttar disha main badhata rahaa or tethis mahaasaagar kaa rasta band kar diya jabaki madagascar vahiin thahar gaya tha or africa plate main sthir ho gaya tha

 Road rage refers to aggressive or angry behavior of the driver of a vehicle or other motor vehicle
 is tarah ke asabhy vyavhaar main ishaare, maukhik apmaan, jaanboojh kar ek asurakshit dhang se yaa dhamkee bhari driving, athwa khatra paidaa karnaa shaamil ho sakate he
 Expressing anger on the road leads to debates, attacks and encounters that can result in injury and even death
 ise ek aakraamak driving kii charam seemaa ke rup main sochaa ja saktaa he
 The term originated during the 1980s in the United States, especially in Los Angeles, California, by news readers on a local TV station KTLA
 yah shabd 1987-1988 ke dauraan utpann hua tha jahaan los angeles main 405, 110 or 10 frivages par avivekpurna frive shooting ghatit hui thi
 These shooting activities cause its members to react to the AAA Motor Club on how to express anger on the road or how to treat a driver with aggressive tips and expressions
 sadak par rosh vyakt karne kii nimnlikhit aam abhivyaktiyaan hai: According to an AAA Foundation study in the US, more than 300 road rage cases have resulted in serious injury and even death - a record 1200 incidents per year and growing annually according to a six-year study Which is investigated by the police at the national level
 kuch nyaayalayon main "sadak par rosh vyakt karnaa" or "aakraamak driving" ke bich kanoonee antar ho sakate hai
 In the US, only a few states have enacted special aggressive driving laws, where cases such as expressing fury on the road - about 1200 per year - are commonly prosecuted for assault and battery, or "ride-related homicide"

 pari-pari se hone vaale visphotak vikaar kaa kaaran aaj tak nahin likhaa ja sakaa he
 There have been different views on whether "expressing fury on the street" is a mental problem
 yah ho yaa nahin ho iske baavjood is baadha par kaabo paane ke liye kai vaikalpik samaadhaan hai
 Expressing fury on the road is a relatively serious task: it can be seen as a threat to the safety of the public
 tathaapi bahari avlokan dwaara manshaa kii jaanch hameshaa sambhav nahin he isliye "rod regers" jinhen police dwaara pakadaa jaataa hai unpar laaparvaah yaa asaavdhaan driving jaise anya aparaadhon kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa he
 
 In some jurisdictions, such as the US Commonwealth of Virginia, it is easier to prosecute road rage as reckless driving rather than aggressive driving because the burden of proof does not require "intent" to successfully plead guilty
 yah sambhaavna he ki jinke kaaran "sadak par rosh vyakt karnaa" ghatnaon ke dauraan gambhir chot yaa maut jaisaa parinaam milte he unako saralata purvak laaparvaahee se isi tarah ke parinaamon ke liye lagu kiye gaye dand kii tulana main adhik gambhir dand bhugatna hoga
