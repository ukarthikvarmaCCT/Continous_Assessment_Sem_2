 Other important precursors to the development of polio viruses were: identification of three polio viruses; The conclusion that the virus must be present in the blood prior to paralysis and the explanation that taking antibodies in the form of gamma-globulin may prevent avascular polio

 The injected solic vaccine provides immunity to the bloodstream through igg, which prevents the development of polio infection from virulence and protects motor neurons and thus eliminates the risk of bulbar polio and post polio syndrome
 
 1954 main is vaxin kaa Arsenal Elementary skool or watasan home for children pittsburg, pencylvania, main pareekshan kiya tha

 Arjun called out from the gate and said to his mother, "mother! Today we have come with a wonderful begging for you
 " us par kunti ne bheetar se hi kaha, "putron! tum log aapas main mil-baant uskaa upbhog kar lo
 "later on knowing that the beggar was in the form of a bride, Kunti was deeply repentant but Draupadi accepted the five Pandavas as her husband to prove the mother's words to be true
 pandavon ke draupadi ko saath le kar apane nivas par pahunchne ke kuch kaal pashchaat unke peeche-peeche krishna bhi vahaan par aa pahunche
 After the formalities were completed, Kunti said to Draupadi, "draupadi! First take out the parts of the gods
 phir brahmanon ko do
 Then separate the fraction of dependents
 uske baad jo shesh bache uskaa aadha bhaag bhim ko or shesh aadha bhaag ham sabhi ko apni deh paroso

 He was the elder brother of Ballur Garh and eldest son of King Ballabh of Agra, Shursen

 Many kings and princes came from far and wide in that swayamvara
 yahaan tak ki devataaon ke raja indra bhi rajkumaari ke saundarya ke vasheebhoot ho vahaan padhaare the
 In Swayamvar, Princess Madhavi put Jayamala on Prince Agrasen's neck
 yah do alag-alag sampradaayon, jatiyon or samskritiyon kaa mail tha
 While Agrasen was Suryavanshi, Madhavi was the daughter of Nagavansh
 is vivaah se indra jalan or gusse se aape se baahar ho gayi or unhone pratapnagar main varsha kaa hona roak diya
 There was a tragedy all around
 log akaal mrityu kaa grass banane lage
 Then Maharaj Agrasen waged war against Indra
 chunki agrasen dharm-yuddh lad rahe the to unka palada baari tha jise dekh devataaon ne naarad rishi ko madhyasth bana donon ke bich sulah karvaa di
 After some time, Maharaja Agrasen did austerity of Shivaji going to Kashi city for the well being of his subjects, so that Lord Shiva was pleased and advised him to do penance for Mother Lakshmi
 maan lakshmi ne paroapkaar hetu kii gayi tapasya se khush ho unhen darshan die or kaha ki apana ek nayaa rajya banaaen or kshaatr dharm kaa paalan karte huve apane rajya tathaa praja kaa paalan - poshann va raksha karen ! unka rajya hamesa dhan-dhaany se paripurna rahegaa| Maharaj Agrasen traveled all over India with his queen Madhavi to establish his new kingdom

 He felt that it was a divine message that was signaling to him to establish a kingdom on this heroic land
 rishi muniyon or jyotishiyon kii salaah par naye rajya kaa naam agreygan yaa agroday rakhaa gaya or jis jagah shaavak kaa janm hua tha us jagah agroday kii rajdhani agroha kii sthapana kii gai
 This place is near Hisar in present day Haryana
 aaj bhi yah sthaan agarwal samaaj ke liye paanchave dham ke rup main puja jaataa he, vartmaan main agroha vikaas trust ne bahut sundar mandir, dharmashalaayein aadi banaakar yahaan aane vaale agarwal samaaj ke logo ke liye suvidhaayen juta di he
 Maharaja Agrasen is called the harbinger of socialism

 Maharaja Agrasen gave birth to a new system in retaliation of the system of systemic governance, he re-established the basic beliefs of the Vedic Sanatan Arya Sanskriti in the reorganization of the state with the development of agri-business, industry, cow slaughter as well as the re-establishment of moral values

 With the grace of Mata Mahalakshmi, Maharaja Agrasen divided his kingdom into 18 republics to form a huge kingdom, which was called Agraya Republic or Agrodaya in his name
 
 Maharishi Garg pledged to perform 18 yajna to Maharaja Agrasen with 18 Ganadhipatis
 yagyon main baithe in 18 ganadhipatiyon ke naam par hi agravansh ke saadhe satraa gotro kii sthapana hui
 At that time, animal sacrifice was compulsorily offered in yagyas
 pratham yajna ke purohit swayan garg rishi bane, sabase bade rajkumaar vibhu ko dikshit kar unhen garg gotra se mantrit kiya
 Similarly, the second yajna was conducted by Gobhil Rishi and the second Ghanadhipati was given the Goyal gotra
 teesraa yajna gautam rishi ne goin gotra dhaaran karavaaya, chauthe main vatsa rishi ne bansal gotra, paanchave main kowshik rishi ne kansal gotra, chathe shandilya rishi ne singhl gotra, saatve main mangal rishi ne mangal gotra, aathven main jaimin ne jindal gotra, nawein main tandya rishi ne tingal gotra, dasven main aurv rishi ne airan gotra, gyaraven main dhaumy rishi ne dhaaran gotra, barahawein main mudgal rishi ne mandal gotra, terahaven main vasishtha rishi ne bindal gotra, chaudaaven main maitrey rishi ne mittal gotra, pandrahawein kashyap rishi ne kuchchhal gotra diya
 17 Yagyas were completed
 jis samay 18 wein yajna main jivit pashuon kii bali di ja rahi thi, maharaj agrasen ko us drishy ko dekhakar ghrinaa utpann ho gai
 He stopped the yagya in the middle and said that in future no person of my kingdom will offer animal sacrifice in the yajna, nor will he kill the animal, nor eat the meat and every person of the kingdom will protect the living beings
 is ghatana se prabhavit hokar unhone ahimsa dharm ko apana liya
 Here in the last and eighty-nine yajna, the sacrifice of animal sacrifice by Yajnacharyo was said to be mandatory, if not, the gotra would remain incomplete, it was said, but in the eighteenth yagna on the orders of Maharaja Agrasen, Nagendra Rishi was invited from Nangal gotra
 yah gotra pashubali naa hone ke kaaran aadha mana jaataa he, is prakaar agarwal samaaj me aaj bhi 18 nahi, saadhe satraa gotra prachlit he

 After attaining a certain age, on consultation with Kuladevi Mahalakshmi, he went into austerities by handing over the rule of the Agrarian Republic to his eldest son Vibhu
 apni jindagi ke antim samay main maharaj ne apane jyeshth putr vibhu ko sari jimmedaari saunp kar vanprastha ashram apana liya
 Even today in history Maharaj Agrasen is mentioned as the supremely virtuous, religious, tolerant, inspiring great man of socialism

 Czlav Miloshanobel Prize Literary Winner, 1980 tetrod yaa chaturagra ek nirvaat nalee he jisamen chaar sakriy electrode hote hai
 Often, the vacuum tubes with two control grids are called tetrodes
 
 There are three electrodes present in the triode, in addition to this there is also a 'screen grid' due to which its properties are quite different from the tetrode
 ucch aavriti-pravardhan-kriya main tridhruvi ke prayog se yah haani hoti he ki pattic or grid ke bich ke madhyadhruvi dharitra ke kaaran donon ke paripath yugmit ho jate hai
 Because of this the function of the triploid at high frequency becomes unstable
 is yugman ke kaaran valve dolan utpann karne lagata he, jisase besuri dhwani aane lagati hai
 This disruptive fraction is overcome by placing another grid in the quadrilateral between the positive and the grid
 is grid ko dhan vibhav par rakhte hai
 This voltage is less than the potential of the plate
 is grid kii upasthiti main dhanagar paripath tathaa grid paripath yugmit nahin hote or dolan nahin utpann hota
 This grid is called the cover grid

 isliye donon hi naliyon main grid-pattic chaalakata praaia: samaan hoti hai parantu chaturdhruvi main pattic pratirodh tridhruvi kii apeksha paryaapt adhik hota he
 The reason for this, as noted above, is the minimal effect of the filler current on the band voltage
