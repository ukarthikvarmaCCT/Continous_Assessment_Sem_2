 Maa poornagiri maan purnagiri kaa darbar Critical ethics is the study of ethics
 yah darshanik nitishastra kii shakha hai, jo un prashnon ko jaanchati hai, jinka udgam yah sochate vaqt hota hai ki naitik taur par kisi ko kaise kaary karnaa chahiyein
 It is derived from the criterion, which relates to, or is based on, an ideal standard or model, which is believed to be the normal or proper way of doing something
 mandandak nitishastra adhinitishastra se alag hai, kyonki vah kaaryon ke sahi yaa galat hone ke maanakon kaa pareekshan karata hai, jabaki meta-nitishastra naitik bhashaa or naitik tathyon ke tatvamimasaa ke arth kaa adhyayan karata hai
 Critical ethics is also different from descriptive ethics, because there are empirical investigations into the moral beliefs of the posthumous people
 anya shabdon main, varnatmak nitishastra kaa sambandh yah nirdhaarit karne se hai ki kis anupaat ke log maanate hai ki hatya sadaiv galat hai, jabaki mandandak nitishastra kaa sambandh is baat se hai ki kya yah manyata rakhni galat hai
 Therefore, sometimes normative ethics is called normative rather than descriptive
 haalanki, meta-nitishastreey drushti ke kuch sanskarnon main jinhen naitik yatharthwaad kaha jaataa hai, naitik tathy ek hi vaqt par, donon varnatmak or nirdeshaatmak hote hai
 Most traditional moral principles are based on principles that determine whether an action is right or wrong
 is style main, clasiki siddhanton main upyogetavaad, kantiwad or kuch sanvidiyavaad ke rup shaamil hai
 These principles mainly provide widespread use of moral principles to address difficult ethical decisions
 is baat ko lekar asahmati hai ki nishchit rup se vah kya hai jo kisi kaary, niyam yaa ayaan ko uskaa nitishastreey bal pradaan karata hai
 Broadly speaking, there are three competing views on how moral questions should be answered, along with hybrid positions that combine some elements of each
 The focus of virtue ethics is on the character of the workman, while both, theistic ethics and consequentialism focus on the status of work, rule or action

 pithogoras ne shanti ke ek niyam kaa prekshan kiya jo acamithia kehalaata tha, is niyam ko todane par maut kii sajaa di jaati thi
 This was because Pythagoras believed that a person's words are usually careless, leading to mispronunciation, and according to him that one should always remain silent if anyone doubts what he should say

 jaise ek krosbaar par kadam nahin rakhaa jaye or faliyaan nahin khaayi jaaen
 These rules were old superstitions such as, "running down a ladder is bad luck

 We have evidence of Pythagorean living depiction as far back as the fifth century BCE, which means that such strange things were said to be puzzles

 Pythagoras wanted to improve the music of his time, believing that there was not enough harmony in this music, it was very busy
 puranic katha ke anusaar, pithogoras ne khoja ki sangeet ke note ko ganitiya samikarnon main anuwaad kiya ja saktaa he, yah tab hua jab vah ek din ek kaam kar rahe lohaar ke paas se ho kar niklaa or usne sochaa ki unki nihaai kii chot se utpann hone vaali aawaaj sundar or saamanjasy purna thi or usne yah nirdhaarit kar liya ki jo bhi vaigyanik niyam iskaa kaaran he vah avashya hi ganitiya hona chahie or ise sangeet par lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 He went to the blacksmith and looking at his tools tried to find out how it happened

 One was half the size of the first and the other was 2 / 3 the size and so on
 
) Pythagoras explained the theory of numbers in detail, the true meaning of which remains a topic of debate among scholars even today
 pithogoras "golon kii santatta " par vishwaas karata tha, unka maananaa tha ki grah or taare ganitiya samikarnon ke anusaar gati karte hai, isi prakaar kii kuch samanta sangeet ke swaron main pai jaati he or isse ek madhur sangeet kaa utpaadan hota he
 Template: Academia chauthi sadi isvi se, pithogoras ko pithogoras kii prameya kii khoj kaa shrey diya jaataa he, jyamiti main ek prameya jo sthapit karti he ki ek samakon tribhuj main vikarn sa kaa varg anya do bhujaaon ba or a ke varg ke yoga ke baraabar hota he
 That is, a2 + b2 = c2
 haalaanki vah prameya jo ab unke naam se jaani jaati he, pehle ise babiloniyon or bharatiyon ke dwaara kaam main liya gaya
 It is often said that he or his students gave the first evidence
 haalaanki is baat par dabaav daalaa janaa chahie ki jis tareeke se babiloniyon ne pithogoras kii sankhyaon ko sambhala usase pataa chalata he ki ve jaanate the ki yah siddhant saamanytah sahi sabit hota he or ve kuch aise pramaanon ke bare main bhi jaanate the jinhen ab tak kunirup sroton main nahin khoja gaya he
 Because of the secretive nature of their school and its students dedicating everything to their teachers, there is no evidence that Pythagoras worked on it himself to prove the theorem
 us maamle ke liye, is baat ke koi pramaan nahin hai ki unhone kisi bhi ganitiya yaa para ganitiya samasyaon par kaam kiya
 Some believe it to be a myth carefully constructed by Plato's followers two centuries after Pythagoras' death
 mukhyatah plato kii para bhautikee ke maamle ko aadhyatmik tehraane ke liye, jo unke dwaara pithogoras ko samarpit vichaaron kaa saath thik prakaar se kaam karte the
 This imposition has been going on for centuries and has been associated with modern times
 pithogoras ke naam kaa is prameya se sambandh sthapit karne kaa sabase pehla ullekh unki mrityu ke paanch sadiyon ke baad sisarau or plutark ke lekhan main miltaa he
 Today Pythagoras is distinguished as a devotee by the Ahl al-tauheed or Druze faith, along with his followers, Greek Plato, but there were also critics of Pythagoras, such as Heraclitus, who said that "learning too much does not make sense; Otherwise it was taught to Hesiod and Pythagoras, and again to Xenophanes and Hecateus
 pithogoras kaa drushtikon dharmik or vaigyanik tha, unki najar main vigyaan or dharm ek dusre se sambandhit hai
 Religiously, Pythagoras was a follower of metempsychosis
 ve sthantar aagaman yaa aatma ke punar janm main vishwaas karte the, unka maananaa tha ki aatma jab tak sadaachari nahin ho jaati tab tak vah maanav, pashu, yaa subjiyon main baar baar avatar leti rahati he
 His idea of rebirth was influenced by ancient Greek religion
 vah pehle vyakti the jisane yah prastaavit kiya kii vichaar prakriya or aatma mashtishk main sthit he dil main nahin
 He himself remembered four lives in detail as he claimed to have lived and used to hear the cry of his dead friend crying as a dog barked
 pithogoras kaa ek vishwaas yah tha ki jivan kaa saar sankhya he
 In this way, the stability of everything makes up the universe
 swasthya jaisi chijen tatwon ke ek sthir anupaat par nirbhar karti hai; kisi bhi cheez kaa bahut kam yaa bahut zyada hona ek asantulan kaa kaaran hota he jo kisi bhi jeev ko aswasth bana saktaa he
 He compared ideas to number calculations
 jab darshan lok siddhanton se jud jaataa he to vah vishwaas ban jaataa he, ki jivan ke saar kaa gyaan sankhyaon ke rup main khoja ja saktaa he
 If it is taken one step further, it can be said that because mathematics is an undiscovered essence, the essence of life is an undiscovered characteristic that can be encountered by studying mathematics
 pithogoras ke koi bhi lekhan nahin milte hai, haalaanki unke naam ke saath kuch jaali lekhan jude hai or inamen se vartmaan main bhi paae jate hai; ye puraatanta main prasaarit hue hai
 Complex ancient sources such as Aristotle and Aristogenus cast doubt on these writings
 pracheen pithogoriens ne aamtaur par apane swami ke vaakyanshon ko muhaavarey autose effe ke saath spasht kiya or apane shikshan kii multah maukhik prakruti par bal diya
 Pythagoras as the character of Ovid's last book in the Metamorphoses, where Ovid explains his philosophical outlook
 pithogoras ko yah kehete hue uddhrut kiya gaya he, "koi bhi aadmi mukt nahin he jo apane aap ko niyantrit nahin kar saktaa he
 " pithogoras kaa ek anya paksh bhi he, jisamen vah apane aitihaasik vyaktitv ke aas paas vistrut kinvadantiyon kaa ek vishay ban gaye
 Aristotle described Pythagoras as a supernatural being who performs miraculous acts, describing him in such an aspect as a Golden Thai, a symbol of divinity
 arestu or anya logon ke anusaar, kuch pracheen log maanate the ki unamem antariksh or samay se hokar yatra karne kii kshamta he or jaanwaron or podhon ke saath baat karne kii kshamta he
 "golden Thai" is an extract from the entry of Brewer's Dictionary of Frace and Fable
 aisa kaha jaataa tha ki pithogoras ke paas ek golden thai tha, jise usne aberis ko darshaya, jo uttardeshvasi pujari tha or usne olympic khelon main pradarshan kiya
 Another legend is drawn from Brewer's Dictionary
 vah unke chandramaa ke bare main varnan ko darshaati he
 Pythagoras believed that he could write on the moon
 unki yojana thi ki rakt main ek darpan par likhaa jaye or ise chaand ke saamne rakh diya jaye or jab chaand kii discs par shilaalekh pratibimbit hoga
 One of Pythagoras's main achievements was the discovery that music is based on a proportional interval of numbers from 1 to 4
 uskaa vishwaas tha ki sankhya pranali or isiilie brahmad pranali, in sankhyaon ke yoga par aadhaarit hoti he: das devataaon ke bajaay das yaa tetractis of di dekad ke dwaara pithogoras kii kasam
 Odd numbers were male and even numbers were female
 usne 3 se 5 jyamitiya thoson se nirmit, ganitiya anupaaton ke siddhanton kii khoj kii
 Hippasus, a member of his sequence, also discovered an proportional number, but the idea was not conceivable for Pythagoras, and according to legend Hippasus was executed
 pithogoras yaa ne varg sankhyaon kii bhi khoj kii
 He found that if for example, if four stones were taken and arranged as a square, then not only each arm is equal to the other arm, but if the two sides are multiplied by each other, they will arrange the square
 Is equal to the sum of the total number of stones in it
 isiilie ise "varg mul" kaha jaataa he
 He was one of the first to think that the Earth is round and all planets have an axis and that all planets revolve around a central point
 unhone kaha ki yah kendriya bindu prithvi he, lekin baad main kaha gaya ki yah kendriya bindu "agni" he jise unhone kabhi bhi surya ke rup main nahin pahachaanaa
 He also said that the moon is another planet that he called "counter Earth" —the latter believed in the limited — unlimited
 pithogoras yaa ek vyapak arth main pithogoriens ne plato ke kaam par ek mahatvapurn prabhaav daalaa
 According to RM Hare his influence consisted of three points: a) The Platonic Republic may be related to the ideas of "an organized community of like-minded people", as Pythagoras established in Croton
 ba) is baat ke pramaan hai ki sambhawatah plato ne pithogoras se yah vichaar liya ki ganit or saamaanya bhashaa, amoort soch darshanik soch ke liye ek surakshit aadhaar he, saath hi vigyaan or naitikta main paryaapt thisis ke liye bhi yaa aadhaar he
 C) Plato and Pythagoras presented the same idea in the "mystic approach to the soul and its place in the physical world"
 aisa lagata he ki donon orfism se prabhavit the
 Plato's ideas were clearly influenced by the work of Architas, an actual Pythagorean of the third generation, who made significant contributions to geometry, which is reflected in the Eighth Book of Elements of Euclid
 pracheen rome or numa pompilius kii kivdantiyon main rome kaa doosraa raja, pithogoras ke adheen adhyayan karata tha, aisa kaha jaataa he
 This is not likely because the two equally accepted dates for life do not impose
 pithogoras ne ek gupt samaaj kii sthapana kii jo pithogorian brotherhud kehalaati he yah ganit ke adhyayan ko samarpit thi
 This had a profound influence on future occult traditions, such as Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry, both groups devoted to the study of mathematics, both claiming to have developed from the Pythagorean Brotherhood
 pithogoras ke ganit ke rahasyamayi or gupt gunon kii charchaa menley pi haal ke adhyay di secret teachings of aal ages main kii gayi he jiskaa sheershak he "pithogorian methmatics "
 Pythagoras's theory later had a profound influence on numerology, which became very popular throughout the Middle East in the ancient world
 8 veen sadi ke muslim kemiagar jabir ebn hayaan ne vyapak sankhya vigyaan ke aadhaar par kaam kiya, vah pithogoras ke siddhant se bahut adhik prabhavit tha
 There is no primary source about Pythagoras
 yah lekh pithogoras kii shastreey vyakhya karata he jo baad ke lekhakon ke lekhon par aadhaarit he
 Since much of the information available is written after centuries of Pythagoras' life, his accuracy is uncertain
 aisa mana jaataa he ki praarambhik pithogorian kaa ganitiya mahatva atishyoktipurna he or pithogorian orfic yani gupt panthi the
 He had an influence on numerology, later serious mathematicians were born out of them when geometry became popular throughout Greece

 cleopatra puraatan misr kii ek unani vansh kii rani thi
 Cleopatra, the common nickname of the Yavan queens of the Talmi dynasty of Egypt
 mulat: yah silyuk vanshi antiyokh mahaan kii putree taalami kii patni kaa naam tha
 But the fame of this name is due to Olitiz, daughter of the 11th Talemi
 uskaa janm lagbhag 69 i
 main hua tha
 Before that, there were six queens of this name in this dynasty
 is kaaran use cleopetra kehete hai
 When Cleopatra was 17, her father died

 But as a result of the rivalry for the state's authority, he had to lose his hands from the state and flee to Syria
 phir bhi usne saahas nahin tyaagaa
 At the same time Julius came to Egypt chasing Caesar Ponpe
 vahaan vah cleopetra par aasakt ho gaya or uski ore se yuddh karne ko taiyaar ho gaya
 Consequently Ptolemy was killed and Cleopatra sat on the throne of Egypt
 misr kii pracheen pratha ke anusaar vah apane ek anya chote bhai ke saath milakar raaj karne lagi
 But soon he poisoned his younger brother and went to Rome to live as Julius Caesar's concubine

 As of September 2007, the HTML code of the adsense search box did not accept XHTML, and did not even follow modern principles of website creation due to the use of the following

 When Jesus was born in Bethlehem, Judea, in the days of Herod King, behold, many astrologers from the East came to Jerusalem and asked
 ki yahudiyon kaa raja jis kaa janm hua he, kahaan he? kyonki ham ne purv main uskaa tara dekha he or us ko pranaam karne aae hai
 Hearing this, Herod the king and all Jerusalem with him were terrified
 or us ne logon ke sab mahayajakon or shastriyon ko ikatthe karke un se poocha, ki messiah kaa janm kahan hona chahie? unhone us se kaha, yahudiya ke baitalaham main; kyonki bhavishyadvaktaa ke dwaara yon likhaa he
 That you, Bethlehem, who is in the land of Judah, you are by no means the least among the officials of Judah; For out of you will come a ruler, who will take care of my people Israel
 tab herodes ne jyotishiyon ko chupake se bulaakar un se poocha, ki tara thik kis samay dikhaai diya tha
 And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "go and find out exactly about that child, and when he meets, tell me the news so that i too may come and bow to him
" ve raja kii baat sunakar chale gaye or dekho, jo tara unhone purv main dekha tha, vah un ke aage aage chalaa or janha balak tha, us jagah ke upar panhuchakar thahar gaya
 us taare ko dekhakar ve ati anandit hue
 And when he reached that house, he saw the child with his mother Mary and fell down on his face and bowed to him; And he opened his bag and offered him gold and myrrh and myrrh
 or swapn main yah chituni paakar ki herodes ke paas phir na janaa, ve duusare maarg se hokar apane desh ko chale gaye
 un ke chale jane ke baad dekho, prabhu ke ek doot ne swapn main yusuf ko dikhaai dekar kaha, uth; us balak ko or us kii mata ko lekar misr desh ko bhaag ja; or jab tak main tujh se na kahuun, tab tak vahiin rahanaa; kyonki herodes is balak ko dhundhane par he ki use marava daale
 He got up at night and took the boy and his mother and went to Egypt
 or herodes ke marane tak vahiin rahaa; isaliye ki vah vachan jo prabhu ne bhavishyadvaktaa ke dwaara kaha tha ki main ne apane putr ko misr se bulaayaa puraa ho
 When Herod saw that the astrologers had mocked me, he was filled with anger; And sending people to Bethlehem and all the boys around it, who were two years old or younger, according to the exact time asked by the astrologers
 tab jo vachan yirmayaah bhavishyadvaktaa ke dwaara kaha gaya tha, vah puraa hua, ki ramah main ek karun-naad sunai diya, ronaa or bada vilaap, rahel apane baalkon ke liye ro rahi thi or shant hona na chaahati thi, kyonki ve hai nahin
 herodes ke marane ke baad dekho, prabhu ke doot ne misr main yusuf ko swapn main dikhaai dekar kaha
 Take up the child and his mother and go into the land of Israel; Because those who wanted to kill the child died
 vah uthaa or balak or us kii mata ko saath lekar israel ke desh main aayaa
 But upon hearing that Arkylaus is ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there; And after getting a reminder of the dream, he went into the land of Galilee
 or nasarat naam nagar main ja basaa; taaki vah vachan puraa ho, jo bhavishyadvaktaaon ke dwaara kaha gaya tha, ki vah nasri kehalaayegaa
 And the child grew and grew strong and filled with wisdom; And the grace of God was on him
 uske mata-pita prati varsh fasah ke parv main jerushlem ko jaaya karte the
 When he was twelve years old, he went to Jerusalem according to the festival
 or jab ve un dinon ko puraa karke lautne lage, to vah ladkaa yishu jerushlem main rah gaya; or yah uske mata-pita nahin jaanate the
 They, thinking that he would be with the other travelers, went off for a day: and began to search for him among their relatives and acquaintances
 par jab nahin mila, to dhundhate-dhundhate jerushlem ko phir laut gaye
 And after three days they found him sitting among the preachers in the temple, listening to them and questioning them
 or jitne us kii sun rahe the, ve sab us kii samaj or uske uttaron se chakit the
 Then they were surprised to see him and his mother said to him; Son, why did you treat us like this? See, your father and i used to look for you with a grudge
 us ne un se kaha; tum mujhe kyon dhundhate the? kya nahin jaanate the, ki mujhe apane pita ke bhawan main hona avashya he? parantu jo baat us ne un se kahi, unhone use nahin samajha
 Then he went with them and came to Nazareth and was under their control; And his mother kept all these things in her mind
 And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in the grace of God and men
 chhathwein maheene main parameshwar kii ore se jibrail swargadoot galeel ke nasarat nagar main ek kunvaari ke paas bheja gaya
 Whose marriage was made to a man of the house of David named Joseph: the virgin was named Mary
 or swargadoot ne uske paas bheetar aakar kaha; anand or jai teri ho, jis par ishwar kaa anugrah hua he, prabhu tere saath he
 She was very nervous with that promise and started thinking, what kind of greeting is this? The angel said to him, Mary! Do not be afraid, because the grace of God is upon you
 or dekh, tu garbhvatee hogi or tere ek putr utpann hoga; tu uskaa naam yishu rakhana
 that would be great; And will be called the son of the Most High; And the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David
 or vah yaqub ke gharaane par sadaa rajya karegaa; or uske rajya kaa ant na hoga
 Mary said to the angel, how will this happen? i do not even know the man
 swargadoot ne us ko uttar diya; ki pavitra aatma tujh par utrega or parampradhan kii samarth tujh par chaaya karegi isaliye vah pavitra jo utpann honevaala he, parameshwar kaa putr kehalaayegaa
 Jesus showed many more signs to the disciples, which were not written in this book
 parantu ye isaliye likhe gaye hai, ki tum vishwaas karo, ki yishu hi parameshwar kaa putr messiah he: or vishwaas kar ke uske naam se jivan paao
 
 yah bahut achche insaan the jiske sir par haath vah dhanya ho jaataa tha yeshu ne apane jivan main anginat chamatkaar kiye jo prithvi par kisi or ke liye naammumkin the In the Bible of Islam, Jesus is considered a venerable prophet who God sent to the Israelites to spread his message
 quran main isa ke naam kaa zikr mohammad se bhi zyaada he or musulmaan isa ke kunari dwaara janm main maanate hai
 In Islam, Jesus is considered a mere mortal, like all prophets and not a member of god-son or Trinity, and their worship is forbidden
 unhen chamatkaar karne kii kshamta ishwar se mili thi or khud isa messiah main aisi shaktiyaan nahin maujuud thim
 It is also not believed that he hung on the cross
 islamic parampara ke mutabiq, cross par marane ke ba-vajood, ishwar ne unhen sidhe swarg main uthaaya gaya tha
 Like all prophets, Jesus Christ is called a Muslim in the Quran
 quran ke mutabiq, isa messiah ne apane aap ko ishwar-putr kabhi nahin mana or ve qayamat ke din par is baat kaa inkaar karenge
 The Muslims believe that on the Day of Judgment, Jesus Christ will return to Earth and exercise justice
 quran main isa kaa naam 25 baar aayaa he
 There is a story of his birth in Surah Maryam and similarly in Surah Ali Imran
 mohammad ke hadison main he ki "tamaam nabi bhai he or isa messiah mere sabase kareebi bhai he kyunki mere or isa messiah ke darmiyaan koi nabi nahi aayaa he"
 Jesus said to them, It is written like this; That Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day
 or jerushlem se lekar sab jatiyon main man phiraav kaa or paapon kii kshamaa kaa prachaar, usee ke naam se kiya jayega
 You are witness to all these things
 or dekho, jis kii pratigya mere pita ne kii he, main us ko tum par utaaruunga or jab tak swarg se samarth na paao, tab tak tum isi nagar main tehre raho
tab vah unhen baitaniyyah tak baahar le gaya or apane haath uthaakar unhen ashish di
 And blessing them, he broke away from them and was taken from heaven
 or ve us ko dandvat karke bade anand se jerushlem ko laut gaye
 And constantly present in the temple and praise God
 yahudee isa messiah ko na to maseehaa maanate hai na ishwar-putr
 They still wait for their Messiah

 But this opinion is not acceptable

 bataaya ja chukaa he ki is bhashaa kaa parichay hone se hi arya jati, uski samskruti, jivan or tathakthith mul aadya aryabhasha se sambhddha vishyon ke adhyayan kaa pashchimi vidwaanon ko thos aadhaar praapt hua
 On the basis of ancient Greek, Latin, Avasta and Rixanskrit etc
, the sound, grammar and form of the original Arya language could be envisaged, in which the contribution of Rixanskrit is of the highest importance
 greek, latin pratnagathic aadi bhashaaon ke saath sanskrit kaa paariwarik or nikat sambandh he
 But Sanskrit is most closely associated with indo-iranian-language languages
 bharat kii sabhi aadya, madhyakaalin evam aadhunik aryabhashaon ke vikaas main mulat: rugveda-evam taduttarkalin sanskrit kaa aadhaarik evam aupaadanik yogadan rahaa he
 Modern linguists believe that colloquial natural languages must have been prevalent in the public since the Rigvedic period
 unheen se pali, praakrit, apbhransh tathaa taduttarkalin aryabhashaon kaa vikaas hua
 But Sanskrit language has contributed most and universally in this development
 yaheen par yah bhi yaad rakhana chahie ki sanskrit bhashaa ne bharat ke vibhinn pradeshon or anchalon kii aryetar bhashaaon ko bhi kaaphi prabhavit kiya tathaa swayan unase prabhavit hui; un bhashaaon or unke bhaashankartaaon kii samskruti or sahitya ko to prabhavit kiya hi, unki bhashaaon shabdkosh unak dhvanimala or lipikla ko bhi apane yogadan se labhanvit kiya
 There were two ancient scripts of India - Brahmi and Kharoshthi
 inamen brahmi ko sanskrit ne mukhyat: apanaaya
 From the point of view of language, the sound of Sanskrit is sufficiently rich
 swaron kii drushti se yadhyapi greek, latin aadi kaa vishisht sthaan he, tathaapi apane kshetra ke vichaar se sanskrit kii swarmala paryaapt or bhashanuroop he
 The cuisine is very rich
 sahasron varshon tak bhartiya aaryon ke aadyashutisahitya kaa adhyanadhyaapan guru shishyon dwaara maukhik parampara ke rup main pravartmaan rahaa kyonki kadachit us yug main, lipikla kaa udbhav or vikaas nahin ho paaya tha
 Probably some time before or after Panini, the script was used in India and mainly "brahmi" was made the vehicle of Sanskrit
 isi brahmi ne arya or aryatar adhikansh lipiyon kii varnmala or varnakram ko bhi prabhavit kiya
 If the Sanskrit language and Brahmi script have sufficient influence on the medieval maternal Indian Dravidian languages and also the alphabet of Tamil, Telugu etc
 dhvanimala or dhwanikram kii drushti se paninikaal se prachlit sanskrit varnmaala aaj bhi kadachit vishwa kii sarvaadhik vaigyanik evam shastreey varnmaala he
 Along with the Sanskrit language, it has been propagated all over the world today as a direct or Roman nonchalant in the whole world
 aitihaasik bhashavigyaan kii drushti se sanskrit bhashaa aryabhasha parivaar ke antargat rakhi gai he
 Aryajati came from outside India or had its residence here - due to unnecessary consideration, it is not being done here
 par aadhunik bhashavigyaan ke panditon kii manyata ke anusaar bharat europea bhashabhashiyon kii jo naanaa pracheen bhashaayen, thi, ve vastut: ek mulbhasha kii deshkalanusaari vibhinn shakhaayen thi
 All of them are called the primary language of origin or native language
 kuch vidwaanon ke mat main-veeraa-mulnivasasthaan ke vaasi susangathit aaryon ko hi "viros" yaa viras kehete the
 The various ancient linguists who refer to the aforementioned ancient Aryabhasa group of languages by the word Viros have been called Viras
 arthath samast bhashaayen paariwarik drushti se aryapariwaar kii bhashaayen hai
 Sanskrit is the second highest among them
 ukt parivaar kii "kentum" or "shatam" do pramukh shakhaayen hai
 The first includes Greek, Latin etc
 sanskrit kaa sthaan "shatam" ke antargat bharat-irani shakha main mana gaya he
 Who is ancient, oldest and oldest in the Aryan family, it is not completely certain
 phir bhi aadhunik adhikansh bhashavid greek, latin aadi ko aadya aryabhasha kii jyeshtha santati or sanskrit ko unki choti bahin maanate hai
 Not only this, the oldest avasta of indo-iranian branch is also considered ancient from Sanskrit
 parantu anek bhartiya vidvan samajhate hai ki "jind-avastaa" kii avastaa kaa swaroop rikbhasha kii apeksha navy he
 Whatever it is, it is so certain that Rakshamita is the oldest in memory from residual memory in the text and hence that language is also the oldest in its achievement
 uski vaidic samhitaon kii badi visheshta yah he ki hajaaron varshon tak jab lipi kala kaa bhi pradurbhaav nahin tha, vaidic samhitaayein maukhik or shrutiparampara dwaara gurushishyon ke samaaj main akhand rup se pravahamaan thim
 The accuracy of pronunciation was preserved so much that the sound and volume, not only, there was no recitation in Vedic mantras from thousands of years ago
 udaatt anudattadi swaron kaa uccharan shuddh rup main purnat: avikrut rahaa
 Modern linguists believe that in terms of vowels, the languages of the "kentum" class of Greek, Latin, etc
 are also much richer and closer to the original or primitive Aryabhasha
 unamem ukt bhashaa kii swarasampatti adhik surakshit hai
 In Sanskrit, consonants are more secure
 bhashaa ke sanghatnatmak athwa roopaatmak vichaar kii drushti se sanskrit bhashaa ko vibhaktipradhan athwa "shlishtbhaasha" kaha jaataa he

 The composition of Agnis soil found in different places is slightly different from each other, but mainly their chemical composition is as follows: silica 59 se 96 pratishat Alumina 2 to 36 percent louh oxide 2 se 5 pratishat Apart from these, small amounts of lime, magnesia, potash and soda are also found
 aluminium oxide or baaluu anupaat main jitani adhik maatra main rahenge utani hi mishran main agni sahane kii shakti adhik hogi
 If the amount of iron oxide or lime, magnesia, potash or other alkaline material is high then it will help in melting of the soil when it gets hot, so when these things remain in the soil in high quantity then the soil does not become fire
 parantu jab ye vastuen ek seemaa se kam maatra main rahati he to ve mitti ke kanon ko aapas main band nahin paatin
 Therefore the soil becomes weak

 He fired an arrow from 25 miles away at the confluence of the Saryu and Ghaghra rivers and he gave the land of twenty-five yojans to the Brahmins
 shar or waar kiye jane ke kaaran is bhoomi kshetra ko sharvaar yaa sarvar kaha jane laga or vahaan ke rahane vaale bramhan sarwariyaa kahalaane lage
 Now, if we look at this story, it is mentioned in the Valmiki Ramayana that this yagna was performed on the banks of the river Gomti
 jisame vashishtha, vamdev or jabali aadi rishiyon ne bhaag liya tha
 But Brahmins of Vamdev and Jabali are not found in Saryuparin Brahmins
 at: ise bhrampurna hi mana jaayegaa kii sarauparin bramhanon ke purvaj is yajna main sammalit the
 Apart from this, the War word used in it is not mentioned in any Sanskrit texts
 angrej itihaaskaar sar es aliot ke apane ek lekh ke anusaar kannauj ke rahane vaale kanyakubj kii hi paanch shakhao main se ek sarayu ke aas paas fail gaye
 Apart from this, according to other English writers Sir John Wombs, W
 Crook, Kanya and Kubja were two brothers whose children went ahead and called Kanyakubj
 or inhi kii ek shakha raja aj ke samay sarayu nadi kinare aa kar bas gaye or sarwariyaa bramhaan kahalaane lage
 Many differences can also be seen in this story
 jaise kii vaayu puraana ke bhuwan vinyas prasang main bramhaji ke janm se lekar bramhan tak ke janm tak kii katha hai
 But in the time of King Aja, there is no reference to Brahmins coming there or settling in their branches
 puraanon se pataa chalata hai ki devgan himalay parvat ke aas-paas rahaa karte the tathaa usee ke nikat hi mahanatam rishiyon ke ashram hua karte the
 Since the Himalayan mountain range is considered very sacred in the Puranas, it seems possible for the sages to stay there
 yadi puranic sandarbho kii ore dekh jaae to jab devraj indra kii aatithy sweekaar kar apane rajdhani ko lautate hue raja dushyant ne rishiyon ke param kshetra hemkut parvat kii ore dekha tha jiskaa varnan padam puraana main aayaa hai : Southern India North of the year kuladev mahabhag tasya seemaa himalayah
 
 tatah kimpurein hemkutadadh: sthitam
 Hari yaar tato jayayan nivadhobadhiruchyte 
 Similarly, in a passage in the Baraha Purana, Maharishi Pulastya, in reference to the journey from Dharmaraja Yudhishthira, states that: tato gachchhet rajendra devikan lok vishrutam
 Maternity vipranam shriyate bharatsarbha
 
 Devikayastte Veeranagaran name Vaipuram
 samridadhyatirmyanch pulsatyen niveshitam
 
 arthath- he rajendra lok vishrut devika nadi ko janaa chahie jaha bramhanon ki utpatti suni jaati he
 There is a beautiful Puri named Veeranagar on the banks of the river Devika which is rich and beautiful
 ek anya puraana ke sandarbh se nishchit hota hai ki devika nadi ke kinare hemkut naamak kimpurush kshetra main rishi-muni rahaa karte the
 "devikaian Sarayavachan Bhavedavikasarvau" arthath- devika or sarayu kshetra ke rahane vaale aavik or sarav kahe jate hai
 Estimates are that the combination of sarva and avar would have formed sarvaar, and then over time the sarvaar would have become pronounced
 isi sarvar kshetra ke rahane vaale sarwariyaa kahe jane lage honge
 In this regard, the following references are found in the Matsya Purana: ayodhyaayaan dakshine yasyah sarayuttah punah
 Sarvavar Deshoyam and Gaud: Dispersed
 
 That is, on the banks of river Saryu in the south of Ayodhya, there is a country of sarvars, similarly Gonda country should also be considered
 sarayu nadi kailash parvat se nikal kar vihaar pradesh main chhapra nagar ke sameep narayani nadi main mil jaati hai
 The river Devika originates in Gandaki along the Brahmaputra, originating from the Himalayas, 60 miles from Gorakhpur
 gandki nadi nepal kii tarai se nikal kar sarvar kshetra hota hua sarayu nadi main samahit hota hai
 Saryu, Ghaghra and Devika, these three rivers flow together in one place
 mahabharat main iskaa ullekh hai ki sarayu, ghaghara or devika nadi himalay se nikalati hai, tino nadiyon kaa sangam pahaad main hi ho gaya tha
 That is why Sarayu is called somewhere Ghaghra and Kahi Devika
 puraanon ke anusaar yahi bramh kshetra hai, jahaan par bramhanon kii utpatti hui thi yathasamay bramh desh se jo bramhan anya desh main gaye, ve us desh ke naam se abhihit hue
 Those who went to the southern region of the Vindhyas were distinguished as Maharashtri, Dravid, Karnataka and Gurjara Brahmins
 or jo vindhyas ke uttar deshon main based, ve saraswat, kanyakubj, gond, utkal, maithil bramhan ke rup main pratishthit hue
 In this way, when Dasavidhi Brahmins became distinguished, they became popular names for the identification of Brahmins resident of Brahmadesh
 vahi aage chal kar sarvary, sarwariyaa, sarauparin aadi kahe jane lage
 Therefore, those who call Saryuparin Brahmins only a branch of Kanyakubja, it is just an illusion
 smritiyon main pankti paavan bramhanon kaa ullekh miltaa hai
 Row Holy Brahmins are only in Saruparino
 jo aaj bhi pantiha yaa panktipaavan ke rup main viddman hai
 Although the number of sages in India has been many, but only 49 sages have gotras
 rishiyon ke shishy pravarkaar maane jate the tathaa us rishiyon ke ashram main jo veda, shakha aadi padhai jaati thi vahi veda, upved shakha sutara us gotra kii maani jane lagi, jo vartmaan tak chalati aa rahi hai
 There is a mythological reference behind what are currently called 3, 13, 16 houses in Saryuparin Brahmins according to which the process of recitation of Shukla Yajurveda started in the ashram of sage Garga to protect the Vedas and reach it to the next generation
 atah rishi garg ko pratham gotrakaar mana jaataa hai
 After sage Garga, Gautama again started the tradition of studying Yajurveda and Samaveda in the ashram of the sage Shaindilya
 or phir yahi teen ashram aage chal kar pratham koti ke garg, gautam or shandilya ghar maane jane lage
 After that, the reading of other branches of Vedos started in the ashrams of 13 other sages
 jo aaj 13 ghar maane jate hai
 Since there is no order of sages like these, they are considered in the same category
 chuki in rishiyon ke ashramon main atharvaveda evam dhanurveda aadi bhi padhaayaa jaataa tha jise us samay shreyaskar nahin mana jaataa tha
 Therefore, Garg, Gautama and Shandilya, who were imparting spiritual education, could not fall under the category of sages
 garg Thirteen boys of Garg Rishi are said to be called Garg Gotriya, Pancha Pravariya, Shukla, Banshaj, who were divided in thirteen villages
 The names of the villages are as follows

 The girls have been married by the ancestors leaving their villages in the Garga, Gautam, and Shandilya gotras
 There has been the same sequence of Pandey of Itar and Dubey of Srar, the marriage of girls has been exchanged in these five, there have been marriages of boys in other gotras
 Now-a-days this exception has started being proved
 All these villages, which have been mentioned, can be found in Vengorakhpur, Deoria, Basti district especially, or there may also be nearby districts, these people all fall under the category of Saryu Parin, elite Brahmin
