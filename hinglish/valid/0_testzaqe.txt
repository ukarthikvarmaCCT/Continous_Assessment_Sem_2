 Wherever i go, people will point fingers at me

 The theory of relativity or relativity, or just relativity, is a fundamental theory of modern physics developed by Albert Einstein and has two major parts - specific relativity and general relativity
 phir bhi kai baar aapekshikta yaa relativity shabd ko gallilian invariens ke sandarbh main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The term, called Theory of Relativity, was first used by Max Planck in 1906
 yah angrezi shabd samooh "relative theory" se liya gaya tha jisamen yah bataaya gaya he ki kaise yah siddhant principal of relativity kaa prayog karata he
 In the discussion section of this paper, Alfred Booker used "theory of Relativity" for the first time
 aapekshikta siddhant sankshep main yah he ki 'nirpeksh' gati tathaa 'nirpeksh' twaran kaa astitv asambhav he, arthath 'nirpeksh gati' evam 'nirpeksh twaran' shabd vastut: nirarthak hai
 If 'absolute motion' had meaning, then it could be certain without referring to other bodies
 parantu sab prakaar se cheshtaa karne par bhi kisi pind kii 'nirpeksh' gati kaa pataa nishchit rup se prayog dwaara pramanit nahin ho sakaa he or ab to aapekshikta siddhant bataata he ki aisa nishchit karnaa asambhav he
 a new approach in physics started with relativity theory
 aapekshikta siddhant ke aane se bhautikee ke katipay puraane siddhanton kaa drudh sthaan dig gaya or anek moulik kalpanaaon ke vishay main sookshm vichaar karne kii aavashyaktaa dikhaai dene lagi
 In science, the function of theory is often to systematically formulate known fruits and then to test new fruits from that theory by experiment
 aapekshikta siddhant in donon kaaryon main safal rahaa he
 By the end of the 19th century, physics was developing according to Newton-inspired theories
 prayek nae avishkaar athwa praayogic fal ko in siddhanton ke drushtikon se dekha jaataa tha or aavashyak nai pariklpanaayen banaai jaati thim
 Among them, the ubiquitous ether had a distinctive place
 ether ke astitv kii kalpana karne ke do pramukh kaaran the
 Firstly, a medium like ether was required for the vibration of electromagnetic waves to propagate from one place to another
 dwitiya, yantriki main newton ke gati vishyak samikarnon ke liye, or jis parshwabhoomi par ye sameekaran aadhaarit the uske liye bhi, ek pramanik nirdeshak kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Specific properties were applied to the ether to accurately assess the fruits of the experiments
 ether sarvyaapee samajha jaataa tha or sampurna dishaao main tathaa pindon main bhi uskaa astitv mana jaataa tha
 In this stable ether, objects could travel without resistance, it was imagined
 in gunon ke kaaran ether ko nirpeksh maanak samajhane main koi baadha nahin thi
 Light speed 3x108 m
 Per second, it was known and waves of light are radiated at this speed relative to 'stationary' ether, it was imagined
 yantriki main veg, twaran, bal ityadi ke liye bhi ether nirpeksh maanak samajha jaataa tha
 In the second half of the 19th century, many attempts were made to experiment with the existence of ether and to establish its properties
 inamen micelsonmorle kaa prayog vishesh mahatvapurn tathaa ullekhneey he
 The purpose of this experiment was to make an accurate measurement of the speed at which the Earth revolves around the Sun with the ether
 kintu yah praytn asafal rahaa or prayog ke fal se yah anumaan nikaala gaya ki ether ke saapeksh prithvi kii gati shunya he
 It also means that the imagery of ether is untrue, that is, ether does not exist
 yadi ether hi nahin he to nirpeksh maanak kaa bhi astitv nahin ho saktaa
 Thus, the motion can only be relative
 bhautikee main saamanyat: gati kaa maapan karne ke liye athwa fal vyakt karne ke liye kisi bhi ek paddati kaa nirdesh dekar kaary kiya jaataa he
 But in these instructional methods, no method can be 'specific', because if it were, then we could consider that 'specific' instructional method as the standard of relaxation
 anek prayogon se aisa hi fal praapt hua
 The fruits of these experiments created serious disturbance not only in physics, but also in science and philosophy
 20veen shatabdi ke prarambh main prasiddh french ganitagya ech
 poincare ne aapekshikta kaa pranium prastut kiya
 According to them the laws of physics should be expressed in such a form that they are real to any observer
 iskaa arth yah he ki bhautikee ke niyam prekshak kii gati ke upar avlambit na rahen
 This act sheds new light on the prevailing conceptions of pain and time
 is vishay main oinstin kii vichaardhaara, yadhyapi vah krantikaarak thi, prayogon ke falon ko samajhane main adhik safal rahi
 Einstein made special analysis of the fundamental words and the prevailing conceptions combined with them, such as speed, acceleration, acceleration, time, etc
 is vishleshan se yah spasht hua ki newton ke siddhanton par aadhaarit tathaa pratishthit bhautikee main trutiyaan hai
 Einstein's theory of relativity is two categories: vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is swaroop main vyakt hote hai ki ve kisi bhi atwarit prekshak ke liye samaan honge
 In the general relativity theory, the laws of physics are expressed in such a way that they will be independent or unrestrained by the motion of the observer
 vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1905 main hua or saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1915 main hua
 It was presented by Einstein in 1905 in one of his papers on the electrodynamics of moving bodies
 vishisht saapekshata do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he jo shastreey yantriki ke sankalpanaaon ke viruddh hai: The results from the theory of specific relativity are surprising; Some of these are as follows: shastreey yantriki main galileo kaa roopaantaran prayukt hota he jabaki vishisht saapekshata main lorents roopantaran 
 The theory of relativity developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1911 is known as 'general Relativity'
 yah siddhanth nimnlikhit do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he- Specific relativity theory improved the assumptions made in physics about length, distance, time, mass, energy, etc
 inke atirikt bhautikee ke kshetra main anya vishay hai jo utane hi mahatvapurn hai, kintu unka samavesh vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main nahin he
 The specific relativity principle can be used in force and electromagnetic fields, as it cannot in the gravitational field
 gurutvkarshan bhautikee kaa ek atyant mahatvapurn vibhaag he, at: spasht he ki vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ko vyapak banane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The relation of mass comes in two ways in physics
 kisi pind par jab bal kaary karata he tab pind kaa sthaan badalata he or uskaa veg badalata he
 The body gets acceleration as long as the force acts
 yantriki ke niyamon ke anusaar bal, pind kaa dravyaman or twaran main nimnlikhit sambandh he : The mass m in this equation is called inertia or dependent mass
 dravyaman kaa doosraa sambandh newton ke guruttviya kshetra main aata he
 According to Newton's theory of gravity, if two masses, m1 and m2, are at a distance r, the following gravitational force f will work between them: is sameekaran main g gurutvkarshan sthiraank he
 If we consider m1 as the mass of the earth and m2 as the mass of another body near the earth, the equation will express the mass m2
 newton kii yantriki main gativigyaan tathaa gurutvkarshan swatantra or bhinn hai, kintu donon main hi dravyaman kaa sambandh aata he
 Einstein integrated the concepts used in these two independent and different divisions of the mass into his general relativity theory
 yah gyaat tha ki jadtv par ashrith dravyaman or gurutveey dravyaman samaan hote hai
 Einstein used this analogy of mass to harmonize kinetics and gravity, and in 1915 AD introduced a comprehensive relativity theory
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant ko ganit main sutrit karne kii jo paddati he vah anya paddatiyon se bhinn he
 It uses special geometry, which is different from Euclid's three-dimensional geometry
 ] ne yah bataaya ki yadi vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main dik ke teen aayam tathaa samay kaa chaturth aayam, in chaaron ayaamon ko lekar ek 'chaturaayam satati', kii kalpana kii jaae to aapekshikta siddhant adhik saral ho jaataa he
 Symmetry is not absolute - it has been proved
 isse newton pranit dik tathaa samay kii nirpekshata or swatantraaa samaapt ho jaati he
 Therefore, to express physical phenomena, the quadrant of time and time is more natural
 riman ne 'chaturaayam dik' kii kalpana karke uski jyamiti kaa jo vikaas kiya tha uskaa oinstin ne adhik upyog kiya
 In this quadrant of time and time, the principles of physics were geometrically placed in the general relativity theory
 is chaturaayam satati kaa yuclid ke teen aayam ke dik se samya he
 In the reality of three dimensions, just as a point or a place is determined by these three coordinates, the length between two points and one is also fixed
 chaturaayam satati main dik ke in teen ayaamon ke saath jab samay bhi joda jaataa he tab samay kaa aayam rup t = x0
5c-1 aata he, jahaan t = samay or c = prakaash kaa veg he
 If one observer specifies a world event, then the speed relative to that observer will be the coordinates of the same event for another observer
 lorenz ke roopantaran ke niyam yadi yatharth hon to siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki By developing the equation, similar but highly complex terms are found for any type of motion
 iske liye nishchalon or pradishon ke siddhanton kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Gravity naturally occurs in the wider relativity theory by expanding the original imaginations in this way
 uske liye vishisht pariklpanaaon kii aavashyaktaa nahin haati he
 The results of many events are the same, according to Einstein's pervasive relativity theory and Newton's pioneering mechanics
 kintu khagoliki main jab saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa upyog kiya gaya tab teen ghatnaon ke fal pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar nikle falon se kuch bhinn rahe
 From these fruits one can take the test of general relativity theory
 ye teen fal is prakaar hai: Interpretation is the expression of any kind of waves of reciprocal processes, resulting in an increase, decrease, or indifference to vibrations and their effects in certain situations
 vyatikaran kaa vistrut adhyayan vishaal vibhedan shakti vaale sabhi yantron ke mul main kaam karata he
 Tomas Young incorporated this concept in physical optics
 unke baad vyatikaran kaa vyavhaar kisi bhi tarah kii tarangon yaa companon ke samavet yaa tajjanya prabhaavon ko vyakt karne ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he
 In short, the situation arising out of the collision of waves due to any kind of waveform is termed as interference
 jab kabhi jal yaa anya kisi drav kii sataha par do bhinn tarangasamooh ek saath milen to vyatikaran kii sthiti utpann ho sakati he
 Where the wavelengths of waves belonging to one waveform are incorporated by the wavelengths of the waves belonging to another chain, the elevation of the surface of the fluid is equal to the sum of possible elevations of the independent and solitary existence of the waves at that location
 jab tarangon main se ek ke tarangashring kaa duusare ke tarangagart par samapathan hota he, tab drav kii sataha par tarangon kaa udwelan kam ho jaataa he or pratifalit unnayan ek tarang avyav ke unnayan or duusare ke avanayan ke antar ke baraabar hota he
 The vibrations produced in a sound are a simple form of this interference, where two or more waveforms, with a slight difference in wavelength, are found moving in the same direction
 prakaash kii gat tarangeey hoti he
 The energy released from a single light source is disintegrated on the lateral side of the medium
 yadi prakaash ke do swatantra strot, jinase samaan pariman or abhinn kala kii tarangen satat ni:sruth hon, ek duusare ke sannikat rakhe jaaen, to madhyam ke aasapaas urja kaa vitaran samang nahin hota, jahaan ek prakashtarang kaa shrung duusare prakashtarang ke shrung par, yaa ek kaa tarangagart duusare ke tarangagart par girtaa he, vahaan aayam bad jaataa he or aayam swaroop urja yaa prakaash kii tivrata bhi bad jaati he
 Also, if the wavelength of one falls on the wavelength of the other, the resulting amplitude is zero and the intensity of light decreases
 pehali sthiti kaa samposhi vyatikaran or duusari sthiti ko vinashi vyatikaran kehete hai
 Thin bars of transparent solids and light bubbles on soap bubbles can give a clear introduction to interference
 jab prakaash kii kirane sabun ke bulabulon, yaa sise kii patale patton par padati hai, to unki bahari or bhitari donon satahon se kirane paravartit hokar prekshak kii aankhon kii ore lautati hai or prakaash ke tarangasamoohon main, jo donon sroton se aankhon tak pahunchati hai, kalaon main sookshm antar hone ke kaaran vyatikaran hota he, jisase utpann prabhaav kaaphi mohak ore chittkarshak hote hai
 a soap bubble is often seen covered with some black lines in a monochromatic light
 kaaran yah he ki kaale dikhaai padanevaale binduon par prakaash ke do tarangasamooh, jo kramash: bulbule kii bhitari or bahari satahon se aate hai, kareeb kareeb yaa purnat: ek duusare ke prabhaav ko nasht kar dete hai
 If the bubble is seen in white light, we usually do not see black lines
 unke sthaan par rangon kii pattiyaan hoti hai
 This is because different colors, the sum of which produces white light, are of different waves, so that interfering at a point of the bubble destroys only a fraction of the color and the remaining elements of the bright light remain
 , Which produce its full chromatic effect on the eyes
 vyatikaran ke liye kuch moulik sharte hai jinaki purti aavashyak he
 Some of these are inherent in the nature of light itself and other, if the result is to be observed by experiment, it becomes necessary
 saralata ke liye ham do vidyut chumbakeey laharon par vichaar kar sakate hai, jo kisi dikbindu par, jahaan se donon lehren guzarati hai, vinashi vyatikaran utpann karen
 If the pattern of interference remains constant, that is, if the resulting light intensity is zero for each value of time at the resulting so-called point, then the following conditions must be met: prakaash dwaara utpann pratirupon ke safal prekshan ke liye do anya sharten, jinaki purti honi chahie, nimnlikhit hai, If two superimposed light sources of equal magnitude and time lines meet at a point in a far-away curtain at a particular point of time, then some exactly lines on the screen with lines of maximum intensity in the gap are seen
 ve nunatam or adhiktam tivrata kii rekhaayen vyatikaran fringen kehalaati hai
 Whenever the fringe fringes are formed by thin films, they are caused by the change in the frequency of the rays participating in the fission
 yah parivartan film kii motaai ke parivartan, yaa aaytan kone ke parivartan, ke kaaran hota he
 If the thickness is not congruent, then often both facts become functional simultaneously; But one thing is clear that when a film is being watched by the eye, it is about 25 cm from the eye
 Should be kept at a distance of
 yadi film kaa paraas bahut bada na ho, to hamaari aankhon tak film ke vibhinn binduon se aati hui kirnon ke jhukaav kii bhinnata koi adhik nahin hoti or prayek kiran kaa aaytan kone kareeb kareeb samaan hota he
 Hence the fringes are formed mainly due to the variation of film thickness
 yah bhi nitant spasht he ki film ke un sabhi binduon par, jahaan motaai samaan he, vahaan prakaash kii dipti bhi samaan hogi
 If any such point is black or bright, the rest will be black or bright accordingly
 isliye kaali yaa ujwal pattiyaan samaan motaai ke film ke vibhinn binduon ke bindupath maatr hoti he
 Such fringes are called the Newtonian rings, because Newton first studied them

 Aristotle propounded by the theory of arbitration that through art and literature our corrupted minds are properly devalued
 safal traasadee virechan dwaara karunaa or traas ke bhaavon ko udbud karti he, unka saamanjan karti he or is prakaar anand kii bhoomika prastut karti he
 Decontamination does not only cause emotional relaxation, it also has emotional refinement
 is tarah arastu ne kala or kavy ko prashansaneey, grahya or sayas rakshneey siddh kiya he
 Aristotle made a successful attempt to restore the importance of art and poetry through this principle
 arastu ke guru plato ne kaviyon or kalakaaron ko apane adarsh rajya ke baahar rakhane kii sifarish kii thi
 He believed that poetry is helpful in nurturing and inciting our lusts and is therefore condemnable and discordant
 dharmik or ucch koti kaa naitik sahitya iskaa apwaad he kintu adhikansh sahitya is adarsh shrenee main nahin aata he
 The importance of the theory of arbitration is multiple
 pratham to yah he ki usne plato dwaara kavy par lagaae gaye akshep kaa niraakaran kiya or doosraa yah ki usne gat kitne hi varshon ke kavyashastreey chintan ko kisi-na-kisi rup main avashya hi prabhavit kiya
 'virechan' is the Hindi version of Greek Katharsis
 unani chikitsashastra kaa paribhaashik shabd he- ‘catharsis’ or bhartiya chikitsashastra kaa paribhaashik shabd he- ‘virechan’
 Its meaning is the purification of physical disorders i
e
 abdominal disorders by interesting medicine
 swasthya ke liye jis prakaar shaareerik mel kaa nishkasana-shodhan aavashyak he, usee prakaar irshyaa, dwesh, lobh, moh or krodh aadi maansik malon kaa nishkasana evam shodhan aavashyak he
 Aristotle uses the term 'catharsis' to symbolically inaugurate the impact of the tragedy on the human mind
 traasadee ke prati plato kii aapatti thi- ‘‘vah maanav kii vaasanaon kaa daman karne ke sthaan par unka poshan or sinchan karti he
 It creates chaos in the soul by raising the lower elements instead of the higher elements
 ’’ Aristotle refuted this invasion of Plato by the catharsis theory and established the utility of tragedy
 plato ne jise dosha siddh kiya tha, arestu ne usee ko gun ke rup main prastut kiya
 Aristotle's opinion is- arthath traasadee kisi gambheer swatah purna tathaa nishchit aayam se yukt kaary ko anukriti kaa naam he
 


 Whose mentality is properly discussed by the apostle from the compassion tragedy
 isi prakaar traasadee keval avaanchhneeya bhaawanaaon ko hi uddipt nahin karti, apitu karunaa or traas ke kritrim udrek dwaara maanav ke vaastavik jivan kii karunaa or traas kii bhaawanaaon kaa nishkasana karti he
 Virechan is mentioned only in two places in Aristotle's compositions
 pratham ullekh uske ‘poytics’ granth main, jahaan tragedy ke swaroop kii ore sanket kiya gaya he or doosraa ‘raajnneetik’ naamak granth main jahaan unhone sangeet kii upyogita pratipaadit kii he
 At these places, he has discussed the form of the word Virechan and its form
 arestu kaa kathan he- ‘‘sangeet kaa adhyayan ek nahin varan anek uddeshyon kii siddhi ke liye hona chahie, arthath shiksha ke liye virechan ke liye
 Music also brings intellectual joy
 xxrep 5 
 dharmik raagon ke prabhaav se ve shant ho jate hai, maanon unke aavesh kaa shaman or virechan ho gaya ho
 Thus purgation means purification
 arestu ke ye vichaar traasadee-vivechan ke sandarbh main footkar rup main milte hai
 They have not been edited in a particular orderly fashion
 aadhunik yug main arestu ke simit or alp shabdon ne purna kavy-shastreey siddhanth kaa rup dhaaran kar liya he
 So a question naturally arose that what did Aristotle originally mean by the motives and catharsis of compassion and tragedy? In this context, the later interpreters of Aristotle presented different meanings and interpretations of the interpretation
 arestu ke vyakhyakaaron main pro gilbert mare or livi ne virechan kii dharmaparak vyakhya prastut kii he
 Religious meaning has a particular background
 iskaa sambandh dharmik utsavon se he
 Prof
 Gilbert Murray states that - "the celebration in Greece of a deity named Deonusus was a symbol of purification in itself, in which the emancipation of the past and liberation from sin and death-consoles
 is prakaar bahya vikaron dwaara aantarik vikaron kii shanti kaa yah upaay arestu ke samay main dharmik sansthaaon main kaaphi prachlit tha
 They have used it figuratively on the basis of this and purgation means "spiritual purification and peace through external stimulation and ultimately its mitigation
" ’’ a German scholar named Barnez gave a strategic interpretation of Virechan
 uske anusaar maanav-man anek manovikaron se akraant rahata he
 Karun and fear are basically sadistic emotions
 traasadee rangamanch par avastavik paristhitiyon dwaara inhen atiranjit rup main prastutkar kritrim aspasht upayon se prekshak ke man main vaasana rup main sthit in manovegon ke desh kaa niraakaran or uske parinamswaroop maansik saamanjasy kii sthapana karti he
 Therefore, purgation has a strategic meaning - mitigation of excitement after stimulation of psychologists and mental mental vividness
 vartmaan manovigyaan tathaa manovishleshan shaastra bhi is arth kii pushti karte hai
 Being a practitioner of mental health, this method is considered ethical
 gete or angreji ke svachhndatavaadi kavi aalochakon main virechan ke kalaparak arth ke sanket milte hai
 Aristotle's famous interpreter Prof
 Butcher is of the opinion that ecclesiology is not merely a sign of a particular fact of psychology or diagnostics, but an expression of an art-theory
 is prakaar traasadee kaa karttavya-karm keval karunaa yaa traas ke liye abhivyakti kaa madhyam prastut karnaa hi nahin apitu inhen ek sunishchit kalatmak parithosh pradaan karnaa he
 They have to be refined and clarified in the medium of art
 virechan kaa arth yahan vyapak he- maansik santulan iskaa purv bhaag maatr he, parinti uski kalatmak parithosh kaa parishkar hi he jiske bina traasadee ke kalaagat aswaad kaa vrutt puraa nahin hota
 The question arises that which of the above three meanings is closest to Aristotle's view? Although Aristotle is naturally influenced by the then religious conditions and Aristotle himself has indicated towards religious music that just as religious music stimulates the audience's emotions and restores, so does the fear of the tragedy observer and the feelings of compassion Wakes up and subjugates them later
 traasadee ke sambandh main yah mat aksharshah thik nahin he, kyonki sangeet dwaara thik kiye janevaale vyakti pehle hi bhavakrant hote the, jabaki prekshagrih main janevaale vyakti karunaa yaa bhay kii maansik sthiti main nahin hote
 Therefore, the effect of the said practice on the concept of the doctrine can be considered indirect; But it is necessary to establish a direct relationship
 jahaan tak nitiparak arth kii baat he, manovigyaan bhi isaki pushti karata he
 Aristotle's means of expulsion not only expel expressions, but also their balance
 isi prakaar pro bujar kaa arth bhi vichaarneey he
 According to him, arbitration has two sides - one is emotional and the other is emotional
 abhavatmak paksh yah he ki vah pehle manovegon ko uttejit karen, taduparant unka shamankar manakshanti pradaan kare
 After this, artistic fulfillment is his emotional side
 virechan ko bhavatmak rup dena uchit nahin he
 Aristotle's intention is only up to the harmony of mind and taciturnism, on the basis of which the current critic Richards has given the theory of 'a set of inertia'
 dow nagendra kaa mat he ki ‘‘virechan kala-swaad kaa sadhak to avashya he- samanjit man kala ke anand ko adhik tatparta se grahan karata he, parantu virechan main kala-swaad kaa sahaj antarbhaav nahin he
 Therefore, it is perhaps not justified to give effect to the theory of purgation
 ’’ According to modern scholars, feelings of tragedy and compassion are manifested in their natural form by becoming more annoying
 traasadee ke prekshna ke falswaroop ve apane anugr evam anaapattijanak rup ko prakashit karti he
 In this form, they emerge as personal and universal
 isse virechan or saadhaaraneekaran kaa ghanishtha sambandh sahaj hi dekha ja saktaa he
 Here the question arises that is the devolution theory the only expedient medium to understand the impact or purpose of the tragedy? Indeed, restricting the act of tragedy to catharsis is like narrowing its purpose
 iske vipareet bhavvaadi samikshakon ne virechan kaa kshetra atyant vistrut banaakar yah siddh karne kaa prayaas kiya he ki virechan se avaanchhneeya bhaawanaaon main bhi parivartan hota he or unka atirek mitata he
 Scholars such as Dryden, Edison, etc
 gave this comprehensive view
 kuch vidwaan virechan prakriya ke astitv ke bare main shankaa karte hai
 They object that such arbitration does not happen in real life
 traasadee se karunaadi manoveg udbuddha to ho jate hai, kintu unke virechan se manah shaanti sarvatha nahin hoti
 In fact, the miracle of tragedy is basically emotional
 vah virechan-prakriya dwaara bhaavon ko udbuddha karti he unka samanjan karti he or is prakaar anand kii bhoomika prastut karti he
 This is an important contribution of the theory of purgation
 doosraa akshep yah he ki traasadee main pradarshit bhaag avastavik hote hai, atah ve hamaare bhaavon ko udbuddha nahin kar pate, virechan kii to baat hi nahin
 Actually, this opinion is also not appropriate
 traasadee dwaara bhavodwek nishchay hi kala-chamatkaar kaa pratifal nahin, ragaatmak prabhaav kii parinti he
 a significant complementary effect is the reason for its success
 atah akshep sarvatha nirmul he
 According to psychoanalytic science, the inattention or suppression of emotions is the leading cause of mental illnesses
 inkaa vichaar bhaavon kii uchit abhivyakti or parithosh dwaara ho saktaa he
 Expressions in the unconscious mind give rise to mental glands due to lack of proper expression
 in grathiyon ko chetan str par laakar man kii ghutan or atrupti ko dur kiya jaataa he
 This relieves the tension of the mind and the mind experiences a kind of vividness and lightness
 manovishleshan shaastra kii unmukt vichaar-pravaah-pranali kaa aadhaar yahi prakriya he
 From this point of view, the psychological basis of purgation is absolutely strong
 frid aadi vidwaanon ne anek sthalon par arestu vaakyon ko apan mat ke samarthan main prastut kiya he
 The impact of the tragedy propounded by Aristotle has a substantial resemblance to Karun Ras in Indian poetry
 traasad prabhaav ke aadharbhoot manoveg he- karunaa or traas
 Both these expressions are basically sad
 udhar karun ras kaa sthaayee bhav ‘shok’ he
 Indian poetics 'mourning' accepts the existence of tragedy with compassion under the permanent sense
 isht naash yaa vipatti shok ke kaaran hai
 They evoke both compassion and tragedy
 vipatti ke saakshaatkaar se karunaa kii, waisi hi vipatti kii punrariti kii ashanka se traas kii anubhuti hoti he
 But the major difference between the views of Indian Acharyas and Aristotle is that the tragic effect of Aristotle is a mixed emotion, while the mourning lasting feeling of Indian poetry is fundamentally immortal, as in the compassion produced by Sita's misfortune, there is no touch of tragedy, whereas Aristotle In the eyes of the tragic Karun incident is not an ideal situation

 tamas gun ke pradhan hone par vyakti ko satya-asaty kaa kuch pataa nahin chalata, yani wo agyaan ke andhkaar main rahata he
 That is, what is good for him or what is bad, this reality is not known and a person of this nature does not even have the curiosity to know it
 satva, rajas or tamas ke bich vargeekaran ko hindu dharm, buddha dharm or sikh dharm ke vibhinn pahaluon main dekha jaataa he, jahaan tamas sabase nimna hota he
 Tamas is a force that promotes darkness, death, destruction and ignorance, lethargy and resistance
 tamas -prabhavit jivan kaa parinaam karm ke anusaar avagun hota he; ek nimna jivan-rup main padavnati he
 a vindictive life is characterized by laziness, carelessness, malice, fraud, insensitivity, criticism and fault finding, frustration, aimless living, lack of logical thinking or planning and making excuses
 tamsik gatividhiyon main zyada khaanaa adhik sona or / yaa drugs or madiraa kaa seven shaamil he
 This is the most negative quality due to the rejection of karma dharma and the central principle of religious religion: no one should do karma and should not be ignored by it
 shastreey bhartiya darshan ke chah skulon main ek sankhya he jisamen in gunon ko paribhaashit kiya gaya he or vistrut vivaran diya gaya he
 Each of the three qualities has its own distinct characteristics and it is believed that everything is made up of these three
 tamas sabase nimna, baari, dhimi or sust sabase hota he 
 yah rajas kii urja or satva kii chamak se rahit hota he
 Tamas can never be opposed by Tamas
 iskaa pratirodh rajas ke madhyam se kiya ja saktaa he or tamas se sidhe satva main parivartit karnaa or bhi mushkil ho saktaa he
