 vaidic or puranic kaal kaa 'dakshin koshal' madhya yug main "chhattisgarh" ho gaya
 The period 1000 to 1500 AD is called Middle Age
 is kaal main hi is kshetra kaa namakaran 'chhattisgarh' ke rup main hua kyonki madhya yug main kile, jo ki vaidic tathaa puranic kaal main 'durg' kehalaate the, 'garh' kahalaane lage

 tatkaaleen kavi jaganic dwaara rachit granth alhakhand main 'mandav garh', 'sirsa garh', 'garh mahobe', 'garh dilli' kaa ullekh he
 The word Garh means a fort with a moat, but in Chhattisgarh, the word Garh was used for the state or districts in addition to the fort
 duusare shabdon main kah sakate hai ki jahaan bhi raja apni rajdhani bana letaa tha us sthaan ke saath garh shabd kaa prayog hone lagata tha
 Even today the fortified palaces and trench fortresses of former kings can be seen in the sad places of the Zamindaris of Chhattisgarh

 Even today residents of Chhattisgarh use the words 'khairagarh Raj', 'raigad Raj', 'raipur Raj', 'patan Raj'
 is prakaar chhattis gadhon kaa samooh hone ke kaaran is kshetra kaa naam chhattisgarh ho gaya
 To know why there were thirty-six strongholds in the group, we have to search the history of Chhattisgarh

 Both Kalachuri dynasties were related to Haihaya Sahasrarjuna of Mahishmati
 isi kaaran se chhattisgarh main ratanpur or raipur ke raja haihyavanshi kahalaaye
 According to the inscribed accounts of the Tripuri branch of the Kalachuri rulers, King Kokalladeva of Tripuri had eighteen sons
 jyeshtha putr ne tripuri main shashan kiya or rajya ke shesh mandal ko shesh satraa bhaaiyon main baant diya

 Aurangzeb took advantage of the opportunity to try his intervention in Marwar
 isse hindooon nasht karne ke liye mogul ranneeti kaa gathan hua or bahut raktapaat ke baad bhi mogul sena safal nahin ho saki
 After the death of Jaswant Singh, two of his queens gave birth to a male child
 inamen se ek kaa janm ke baad hi nidhan ho gaya or anya ajit singh ke rup main unka uttaradhikari bana
 By February 1679 the news reached Aurangzeb but he refused to consider the children as legitimate heirs
 unhone jazia kar bhi laga diya
 Now Maharaj Ajitsingh was eighteen years of age
 dhire-dhire rajya kaa kaam samaj gayi the, or is yogya ho gayi the ki durgadas kii sahaayta bina hi rajya-bhaar vahan kar saken
 Seeing this, Veer Durgadaras handed over the burden to Maharaj Ajit in the year 1758

 When Aurangzeb was killed in the south in 1765, his eldest son Muazzam ascended the throne and followed his subjects like his forefather Emperor Akbar
 hindu-musalmaan main kisi prakaar kaa bhedbhaav na rakhaa
 Seeing this, Durgadas got convinced and handed over the kingdom to Ajitsingh completely, but being independent, a lot of change happened in Ajitsingh's nature
 phooti hui kyari ke jal ke samaan svachhnd ho gaya
 At the behest of his voluntary friends, the subjects were sometimes punished heavily against justice
 kramash: apane haani-laabh par vichaar karne kii shakti ksheen hone lagi
 Just like Joe used to advise
 , karne par taiyaar ho jaataa tha
 He himself did not see anything
 , kaanon hi se sunata tha
 The person who blew his ears first believed the truth about him
 dhire-dhire praja bhi ninda karne lagi
 Durgadas preached a number of times, explained and extinguished a lot, but the way a drop of water stops on a lotus leaf, and falls immediately from the gust of wind, in the same way as something on Ajitsinh's heart The preaching was effected, immediately selfish friends threw it out and even tried that Maharaja's arbitrariness took place on behalf of Durgadas
 dhire-dhire anyaay badhata hi gaya
 Being compelled, Durgadas sent his family to Udaipur and lived alone in Jodhpur and waited for the consequences of injustice
 manushya apane haath se seenche hue vish-vriksh ko bhi jab sookhte nahin dekh saktaa, to yah to vir durgadas ke poojya swami shri maharaj jaswantsingh ji kaa putr tha

 parantu karata kya? swaarthee mitron ke aage uski daal na galati thi, atev jodhpur se baahar hi chalaa janaa nishchit kiya
 Taking the opportunity one day was going to the court to take leave from Maharaj
 raste main ek vruddh manushya mila, jo durgadas kaa shubhachintak tha
 Brother Durgadas started saying! Would have been nice if you didn't go to the court today; Because you are not skilled in going to the court today
 mujhe jahaan tak pataa chalaa he vah yah ki maharaj ne apane swaarthee mitron kii salaah se aapke maar daalane kii gupt rup se ajna di he
 Durgadas said - 'brother! Now i am old, i have to die, then why should i fear death by being a Kshatriya? Stigma in Rajputi; Afraid of death, go back! Saying thus, Nirbhay reached the court like Singh and with folded hands asked the Maharaja for a pilgrimage
 maharaj ne upree man se kaha – ‘ chachaaji! aapkaa viyog hamaare liye bada dukhad hoga; parantu ab aap vruddh hue hai, or prashn tirthayatr kaa he; isliye nahin bhi nahin kii jaati
 Well, go back as soon as possible
 durgadas ne kaha – ‘ maharaj kii jaisi ajna or chal diya; parantu dwaar tak jaakar lautaa
 Maharaj asked uncle, why? Durgadas said - 'maharaj, i will not go today; i just remembered that Maharaj Yashwant Singh had given me the key to a secret treasure, but till now i could neither tell you the secret treasure nor could i give the key; Therefore, i should also hand it to you, then go? Because now i am very old, i do not know when and where i die
 Then this unlimited amount of paddy will be found in all the soil
 yah sunakar ajitsingh ko lobh ne dabaa liya
 Who in the world is not surrounded by greed? Who has violated the command of the greed god? Started thinking; If according to my knowledge Durgadas was killed somewhere, then this property will not come into his hands
 kya or avasar na milegaa? phir dekha jaayga
 Thinking this, he indicated to his friends
 iskaa aashay samaj kar ek ne aage badhkar niyukt purush ko vahaan se hataa diya
 Thus by cleverly luring paddy, Chatur Durgadas protected his life
 ghar aayaa, hathiyaar liye, ghode par savaar hua or maharaj ko kahala bheja ki durgadas kutto kii maut maranaa nahin chahta tha
 The brave who dared in the battlefield
 ajitsingh yah sandesh sunakar kaanp gaya
 Said Durgadas to go wherever he wants jo 【【aurangzeb】】 sareekhe badshaah se ladakar apana desh chin le, ham aise vir purush kaa saamana nahin karte

 But in all these methods, shortened letters were abbreviated by removing short letters and some other letters in between words, making it easier for the speaker's speech to be noted

 To make a horcruce, one has to kill
 is tarah se kaale jaadugar amartv hasil karnaa chaahate hai
 The evil Lord Voldemort had made seven horcruxes
 horcrax banane ke liye jeevadhariyon or nirjeev donon kaa hi prayog kiya jaataa he, haalanki isamen jeevadhariyon kaa prayog jokhimpurna hota he, kyonki koi bhi jeevadharee apana bachaav kar saktaa he or soch saktaa he

 haalanki, isamen banane vaale kii aatma dhire-dhire kai chote tukdon main bantati jaati he, isliye vah apni swaabhaavik maanviyata khotachaala jaataa he or uski aatma atyadhik asthaayee ho jaati he
 atyadhik vishisht paristhitiyon main, aatma kaa ek tukdaa banane vaale kii jaankaree or iraade ke bina kisi vastu main band kiya ja saktaa he
 vah vastu jiske andar is prakaar se aatma kaa tukdaa surakshit kiya jaayegaa, anya kisi horkrax kii tarah hi banane vaale ke amartv ko sangrakshit karegi, kintu yah "gopneey jaadui vastu" ke antargat nahin aayegi

 At the end of the second book, Harry rescues Ginny and destroys it with Basilisk's poisonous teeth, making Harry the first horcrux to be destroyed
 When he told Dumbledore about this diary, Dumbledore first realized that Voldemort had made not one, but several horcruxes: "what i found most surprising was that this diary was a weapon and a Rescue has been used both ways ", Rowling, the half-blood prince indicating that Voldemort must have other remedial measures as well

 Before his death, Dumbledore hides the black stone of the ring in a golden snitch and in his will leaves the snitch under Harry's possession
 Dumbledore knew that this stone was in fact a resurrection stone, one of three deathly hallows
 This was the reason why Dumbledore wore this ring in his finger: he hoped to activate it and contact his dead family, but had forgotten that the ring was now also a horcrux and so it is quite likely that Be protected by destructive mantras
 Voldemort remained oblivious to the other magical properties of this stone all his life

 Lord Voldemort made his fifth Horcrux in the crown of Hogwarts co-founder Ravenna Ravencla
 The mantra that was required to create this Horcrux was read by Voldemort after killing an Albanian farmer
 is mukut ko iske naam ke dwaara kitaab dethale hellos main bataaya gaya tha, lekin vastav main pehali baar iskaa zikr da half blad prince main room of riquirement main "ek kalankit mukut" ke rup main kiya gaya tha

 Main article: Harry Potter Voldemort inadvertently installed a part of his soul inside Harry Potter's attempt to kill him
 The incident occurs just before the first lesson in The Philosopher's Stone
 Rowling has clearly stated that Harry was never truly a "dark object" because the spells that make up the horcrux were not recited upon him
 yah alag baat he ki, anya horkraxes ke samaan jab tak voldemort kii aatma kaa ansh harry main rahegaa tab tak vah amar rahegaa
 da dethale hellos ke chouteesven paath ke ant main voldemort kii aatma kaa ansh anjaane main usee ke dwaara elder vaind se nasht kar diya jaataa he
ek bachche ke rup main, harry potter usee kamare main tha jab voldemort dwaara lagaaya gaya ghaatak kiling kars waapas usee par paravartit ho gaya
 nirantar htya or uske dwaara banaaye gaye horkraxes ke kaaran uski aatma bahut hi kamazor or asthaayee ho gayi thi
 This unsuccessful curse caused a part of Voldemort's soul to drain from his body into Harry's body, making Harry virtually a horcrux
 The electric arrow-like mark on Harry's forehead was a direct result of this reported murder
 is sambandh kaa prayog kathanak ke kai mukhya binduon ke varnan main kiya gaya he
 sampurna shrinkhalaa ke dauraan, harry voldemort kii maansik or bhaavnaatmak avasthaaon kaa anubhav kar paata he, jiske madhyam se kitaab padhane vaale ko bhi shrinkhalaa ke pramukh parapidak ke sambandh main apratyaksh tareeke se jaankaree ho jaati he
 anubhav kii in ghatnaon ke dauraan aksar hi harry ke maathe ke nishaan main dard hota he
 voldemort ke madhyam se harry ke andar bhi parselatang bolne or samajhane kii kshamta aa gayi thi
 In an interview by Rowling it is reported that Harry's forehead pain, when he experienced Voldemort's strong feelings, is actually the same part of Voldemort's soul that had entered Harry's body and She is ready to leave Harry's body in these stages and meet with her main soul
 When Wolde Momert is told about Harry's ability to perceive Even when he could find it, he was unaware of the part of his soul present in Harry's body
 jab harry potter and da dethale hellos ke ant main voldemort ne kiling kars dwaara harry kii htya kaa prayaas kiya to usne swayan hi harry ke andar upasthit apni aatma ke ansh ko nasht kar diya
 iske nasht ho jane ke saath hi, in donon ke bich kaa sampark bhi samaapt ho gaya or phir harry ko kabhi bhi uske maathe ke nishaan par punah dard nahin hua
 rouling ne bataaya ki iske saath hi harry kii parcelatang bolne or samajhane kii kshamta bhi samaapt ho gayi
 Ices: arun, yaa uranus hamaare saura mandal main surya se saatvaan grah he
 It is the third largest planet in the solar system by diameter and the fourth largest planet by mass
 dravyaman main yah prithvi se 14
5 guna adhik baari or akar main prithvi se 63 guna adhik bada he
 On average, it is much less dense than the Earth - because stones and other heavy materials are in greater percentage on Earth, while Arun has more gas
 isiilie prithvi se tiresth guna bada akar rakhane ke baad bhi yah prithvi se keval saadhe chaudaa guna baari he
 Although Arun can also be seen with the eye without binoculars, it is so far away and appears to have so much light that ancient scholars never gave it the status of a planet and considered it a distant flickering star
 13 march 1781 main wiliam harshal ne isaki khoj kii ghoshnaa kari
 Arun was the first planet to be found by telescope
 hamaare saura mandal main chaar grahon ko gas daanav kaha jaataa he, kyonki inamen mitti-pathar kii bajaay adhiktar gas he or inkaa aakaar bahut hi vishaal he
 Arun is one of them - the remaining three are Jupiter, Saturn and Varuna
 inamen se arun kii banaavat varun se bahut milti-julati he
 In the atmosphere of Arun and Varun, there is more snow than Jupiter and Saturn - in addition to water ice, they also have frozen ammonia and methane gases
 isliye kabhi-kabhi khagolashastri in donon ko "barfile gas daanav" naam kii shrenee main daal dete hai
 Out of all the planets in the solar system, Arun's atmosphere has been found to be coldest and its minimum temperature has been observed to be -49 Calvin
 is grah main badalon kii kai tahen dekhi gai hai
 It is believed that below all there are clouds of water and above all there are clouds of methane gas
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki yadi kisi prakaar arun ke bilkul bich jaakar iskaa kendra dekha ja saktaa to vahaan barf or pathar paae jate
 Uranus makes one round of the Sun every 84 Earth years
 isaki surya se ausat duuri lagbhag 3 arab kimi he
 The intensity of sunlight on Uranus is about 1 / 1400 compared to that on Earth
 sabase pehle iske kakshiya tatwon kii gananaa 1783 main piyare-simon laplas dwaara kii gai thi | samay ke saath, anumaanit or awalokit kakshaon ke bich kii visangatiyaan najar aani shuru ho gai or 1841 main jon couch adams ne sabase pehle prastaavit kiya ki yah antar kisi adrishy grah ke gurutvkarshan khinchaav ke kaaran ho saktaa he
 In 1845, Urbann Le Verrier began his independent research on the orbit of Uranus
 On 23 September 1846 Johann Gottfried Galle discovered a new planet, later renamed Neptune, close to the position predicted by Le Verriere
 urenus ke bheetar kii ghurnan avadhi 17 ghante, 14 minute he
 Like all giant planets, its upper atmosphere also feels very powerful winds in the direction of rotation
 kuch akshanshon par jaise ki bumadhya rekha se dakshin dhruv kii ore ke do-tihaai raste par, vaataavaran kii drishy akritiyaan bahut teji se chalati he or chote se chota 14 ghanton kaa ek purna ghurnan banaati he
 Uranus has an axial inclination of 97
77 degrees, so its rotation is roughly parallel with the axis of the solar system
 yah usko anya pramukh grahon ke vipareet puri tarah se bhinn mausami parivartan detaa he
 Other planets can be seen moving around the solar system at the bottom of the ball, while Uranus cruises like a swinging ball
 urenus sankranti ke vakt ke kareeb, ek dhruv lagaataar surya ke saamne rahata he jabaki doosraa dhruv pare rahata he
 Only the narrow belt around the equator senses rapid day-night cycles, but with the sun far below the horizon, along the way in the Earth's polar regions
 uranus kii kaksha ke duusari ore par surya ke saamne ke dhruvon kaa abhivinyas ulat he
 Each pole gets light continuously around 42 years, then spends the next 42 years in darkness
 vishuvon ke samay ke paas, surya urenus ke vishuvvrutt ke saamne hota he or din-raat ke chakron kii ek samyavadhi detaa he, usee tarah jaisi vah adhiktar anya grahon main dekhi gai
 Uranus reached its most recent equinox on 7 December 2007
 is aksheeya jhukaav kaa ek parinaam yah he ki, varsh ke ausat kaal main, urenus ke dhruviya kshetra iske bumadhyarekhiy kshetron kii tulana main surya se niveshit urja kaa vrihattar hissaa praapt karte he
 Yet Uranus is hotter at its equator than at its poles
 iske liye uttaradaayi antarnihit tantra agyaat he
 The reason for Uranus' unusual axle tilt is also not known with certainty, but as usual speculation is that during the solar system formation, an Earth-sized tributary collided with Uranus and caused this asymmetric orientation
 At the time of Voyager 2's passing in 1986, the south pole of Uranus was almost directly towards the Sun
 grah ke ghurnan kii disha ke maujuud hone ke baavjood, "dakshin" ke rup main pahchaan ke liye iskaa dhruv haal ke antarrashtriya khagoleey sangh dwaara samarthit paribhaasha kaa upyog karata he
 That is, the North Pole of the planet or satellite will be the pole which will be above the invariant plane of the Solar System
 kabhi kabhi ek bhinn paripati prayog kii jaati he, jisamen ek pind ke uttar or dakshin dhruvon ko ghurnan kii disha ke sambandh main dakshin-hast niyam ke anusaar paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 In the terms of this second coordinate system, the north pole of Uranus was the one which was towards the Sun in 1986
 1995 se 2006 tak, uranus kaa abhaasi pariman + 5
6 or + 5
9 ke bich ghatata-badhata rahaa, nagn ankhon kii drishyata kii seemaa ke thik bheetar rakhane par pariman + 6

 Its angular diameter is 3
4 and 3
7 arc seconds, 16 to 20 arc seconds for Saturn and 32 to 45 arc seconds for Jupiter for comparison
 vimukhataa par, urenus ratri akaash main nagn aankhon se dikhataa he or doorabeen ke saath shahari parivesh main bhi ek aasaan lakshya ban jaataa he
 15 and 23 cm With large telescopes of diameter, this planet looks like a light greenish blue swatch

 Uranus has a mass of 14
5 times that of Earth, which is the lowest among the massive planets
 isaki trigya nepchun kii tulana main thodi si zyada or prithvi kii trigya kii chaar guna he
 As a result, a density of 1
27 g / cm3 makes Uranus the least dense planet after Saturn
 yah maan ingit karata he ki yah mukhya rup se vibhinn prakaar ke barfon se bana he, jaise ki jal, ammonia or methane | uranus ke aantarik bhaag main barf kii samgr maatra thik se gyaat nahin he, model ke chunaav ke hisaab se alag alag aankade ubharkar saamne aate he, yah prithvi ke dravyaman ke 9

 The standard model of the Uranus structure is that the planet is composed of three layers: a rocky core in the center, an icy mantle in the middle, and an outer gaseous rind
 The core is relatively small with an Earth mass of 0
55 and a radius less than the 20% radius of Uranus, the mantle incorporates a large amount of planets with 13
4 Earth masses, while the upper atmosphere is comparatively unrealistic with a weight of 0
5 Earth mass
 And extend at a 20% radius of the last edge of Uranus

 The ice mantle is not actually made of ice in the traditional sense, but is a hot and dense fluid composed of ammonia, water, and other volatiles
 is taral padaarth ke paas ek ucch vidyut chaalakata he, jise kabhi kabhi ek taral-ammonia sagar kehalaata he
 Most structures of Uranus and Neptune are very different from those of Jupiter and Saturn, with gases dominating ice, so their distinct classification as ice demons is upheld
 vahaan ynit jal kii ek parat ho sakati he, jahaan pani ke anu hydrogen or oxigen yanon ke ek soup ke rup main tut jate he or iske neeche gahare main parainit jal he, jisamen oxigen crystalikrut hota he kintu hydrogen aayan oxigen ke jalidaar dhaanche ke bheetar aazaadee se ghumta phirata he
 Although the model is thought to be above the norm, it is not unique, other models also satisfy observations
 udaahranarth, agar hydrogen or chattani saamagree kii paryaapt maatra barf mental main mishrit hui hai, to aatanrik bhaag main barf kii kul maatra kam ho jaayegi or isi tarah chattaanon or hydrogen kii maatra adhik ho jaayegi | vartmaan main uplabdh aankade, koun sa model sahi he iske nirdhaaran kii vigyaan ko anumati nahin detaa he
 The fluid-rich internal structure of Uranus means that it has no solid surface
 gasiy vaataavaran bhitari taral paraton main dhire dhire ghulata miltaa he
 For convenience, a perpendicular flat spheroid is determined at a point at which the atmospheric pressure is equal to 1 bar and is also designated as a "surface"
 isaki vishuvvrittiya or dhruviya trigya kramshah 25,559 ± 4 or 24,973 ± 20 kimi he
 This surface will be used in this article as a zero point for elevation
 uranus kaa aantarik taap spasht rup se anya vrihadaakaar grahon kii tulana main kam jaan padataa he, khagoleey shabdon main, iske paas ek nimna tapiya pravaah he
 Why Uranus's internal temperature is so low is still incomprehensible
 nepchun, jo ki aakaar or sanrachana main urenus kaa dwiguna he, 2
61 guna zyada urja antariksh main vikarit karata he jitna ki vah surya se praapt karata he
 The total power released from part of the infrared spectrum by Uranus is 1

042 ± 0
047 wat / me2 he, jo 0
075 wat / me2 ke lagbhag prithvi ke aantarik tapiya pravaah se kam he
 The lowest temperature recorded in Uranus' tropopus is 49 Kelvin, making Uranus the coldest planet in the solar system
 is visangati ke liye ek pariklpana suzav detii he ki jab uranus ek vishalkay praharit nikaay dwaara thonka gaya, uranus kii adhikansh aadya garmi ke nishkasana kaa kaaran bana, yah garmi ek samaapt ho chuke kor taapmaana ke saath chodi gai thi | ek anya pariklpana he ki uranus ke upree paraton main kisi tarah kaa avrodh maujuud he jo kor kii garmi ko sataha tak pahunchne se roktaa he
 For example, convection can take place in a group of structurally dissimilar layers, which can impede upward heat transport, making it possible that dual diffusive convection may be a limiting factor
 wayager 2 kii pahunch se pehle, urenus ke magnetosphere kaa koi bhi maapan nahin liya gaya tha, isiilie isaki prakruti ek rahashya bani rahi | 1986 se pehle, khagolavidon ne urenus ke chumbakeey kshetra ko saura vaayu ke saath kii rekha main hone kii ummid thi, iske baad iskaa grah ke dhruvon ke saath milan ho gaya jo ki krantivrutt main sthit he
 Voyager's observations showed that Uranus' magnetic field is distinct for two reasons, one because it does not originate from the geometric center of the planet and another because it is tilted at 59 ° from the rotational axis
 vastav main yah chumbakeey dwidhruv grah ke centre se dakshin ghurni dhruv kii ore grahiy vyas ke adhiktam ek tihaai jitna khisak gaya he
 This unexpected geometrical result in the high asymmetric magnetosphere, where the strength of the magnetic field on the surface of the southern hemisphere may be the lowest 0
1 gauss, similarly it may be the highest 1
1 gauss in the northern hemisphere

 For comparison, the Earth's magnetic field is roughly powerful at both poles and the 'magnetic equator' is roughly parallel with its geographic equator

 The names for these satellites have been chosen from characters in the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope
 paanch mukhya upgrah he : miranda, arial, ambrial, titania or oberon | yah urenus upgrahiy pranali gas daanvon ke bich sabase kam badi he; sachmuch, in pramukh upgrahon kaa sanyukt dravyaman akele tritone ke aadhe se bhi kam hoga
 The radius of Titania, the largest of these satellites, is just 788
9 km, or less than half of the moon, but slightly higher than Saturn's second largest moon, Ria, which makes Titania the largest moon in the solar system

 isi ke saath aryak kii rajyaprapti kii raajnneetik katha bhi gunthi hui he
 Kritikar has skillfully combined the two stories
 yah naatak mote taur par do hisson main hai- pehla, vasantsena or charudatt kaa prem-prasang tathaa doosraa, rajya vidroh ke saath aryak ko rajpad kii prapti
 First issue: There is a story in this issue that the king's brother-in-law wants to get Vasantasena, the famous courtesan of Ujjayini
 apane do saathiyon ke saath ek andheri raat main vah vasantsena kaa peechha karata he
 The terrified Vasantasena takes Sharan at Charudatta's house
 choron se bachane kii baat kahkar vah apane saare swarna-aabhushan charudatt ke ghar main dharohar ke rup main chhod detii he
 Number two: The conductor, who was previously in the service of Charudatta, loses a lot of money due to gambling addiction
 bachaav ke liye vah vasantsena ke ghar shaaran letaa he, jo apana kangan dekar use rinmukt karti he
 He becomes a Buddhist-monk
 teesraa ank : sharvilak naam kaa brahman vasantsena kii daasi madnika se prem karata he
 To free him from slavery, he breaks into Charudatta's house one night and steals all the gold jewelery kept by Vasantasena
 udhar charudatt kii pativrata patni dhoota apane pati ko lokaninda se bachaane ke liye, churaae gaye aabhushaanon ke badale main apni keemtee ratnavali detii he, charudatt vah ratnavali dekar vidooshak maitrey ko vasantsena ke ghar bhejtaa he
 Fourth issue: Sharvilak arrives at Vasantasena's house to take Madanika free from slavery by taking stolen stolen clothes
 chori kii baat sunakar madnika bahut dukhi hoti he
 In the spirit of correcting this mistake, she convinces Sharvilak that by handing over stolen robes to Vasantasena, he will not remain a thief, nor will there be a loan on the head of Charudutt and he will get Vasantasena's jewelery back, Sharvilak does so
 vah vasantsena se kahata he ki charudatt ne yah sandesh bheja he ki ghar jarjar hone se ham swarnapaatr ko surakshit nahin rakh sakate, atah aap ise apane paas rakhen
 Vasantasena hands Madanika to Sharvilak, asking him to take something in exchange for the message
 isi ank main vidooshak vasantsena se milakar kahata he ki swarnapaatr jue main haar gaye hai isliye yah ratnavali sweekaar karen
 Vasantasena knows the reality, but does nothing
 vah shaam ko charudatt ke ghar aane kaa nishchay karti he
 Fifth issue: This season describes the rainy season
 vasantsena charudatt se milti he or varsha kii jhadi ke kaaran raat usee ke ghar ruk jaati he
 Sixth Point: In the morning, Charudatta goes for a walk in the Pushparkandak garden, with the promise of keeping the car ready for Vasantasena so that he can travel to the park there
 yaheen vasantsena charudatt ke putr rohsen ko yah jid karte dekhati he ki vah mitti kii gaadi se nahin swarna-shakatic se khelnaa chahta he
 Vasantasena puts all the clothes in a clay cart and says that to make a gold car from it
 vasantsena charudatt se udyaan main bhent karne nikalati he, par bhul se usee sthaan par khadi shaakaar kii gaadi main baith jaati he
 Meanwhile, Gawale's son Aryak, who breaks the prison and runs out after killing the guard, gets into Chaudutt's vehicle for rescue
 raste main do police ke sipaahi- virak or chandanak vaahan dekhte bhi hai, par unamem se ek aryak ko raksha karne kaa vachan dekar jane detaa he
 Seventh issue: Aryak named Aryak, who believed that King Palak believed in the prophecy of the Siddhas, was imprisoned when he broke the bond and climbed into the car of Charudatta and came in front of Chaudatta in the garden and asked for his protection
 charudatt use surakshit apni gaadi main baahar nikalava detaa he
 Eighth issue: When Vasantasena, who was sitting in a carriage of Shakara by mistake, reaches the garden, he is confronted by the evil Shakar in place of Charudatta
 vasantsena ek baar phir shaakaar ke changul main fas jaati he, shaakaar kaa aagrah na maanane par vah vasantsena kaa galaa ghont detaa he or use mara jaanakar patton se dhak kar chalaa jaataa he
 That is why the conductor, who has become a Buddhist-monk from the gambler, brings life back to Vasantasena, the deceased
 navaan ank : shaakaar charudatt ko vasantsena kii hatya kaa aaropee banaata he
 Controversy goes on in court, Charudatta is unable to prove himself innocent
 dukhi charudatt apane mitra maitrey kii pratiksha karata he, jo vasantsena ke paas un aabhushanon ko lautaane gaya tha jo vasantsena ne rohsen kii mitti kii gaadi ke sthaan par sone kii gaadi bana lene ko de die the
 Maitreya arrives at the same moment with the same ornament
 kintu baatcheet karte hue maitrey se bagal main sanbhale hue ve aabhushan sabake saamne gir padate hai or yah maan liya jaataa he ki aabhushanon ke lobh main charudatt ne hi vasantsena kii hatya kii he
 He is ordered to death and taken to the slaughter
 dasavaan ank : is ank main ek to shaakaar kaa sevak sthvarak charudatt ko nirdosh bataata he, par uskaa koi vishwaas nahin karata
 At the same time, Vasantasena expresses the wickedness of Shakara by coming with a vampire who has become a Buddhist-monk who saves his life and Charudatta is freed from false accusation
 idhar rajya main nae raja aryak kaa aagaman hota he, vah na keval aarope mukt charudatt ko rajya detaa he, balki jhootha aarope lagane ke kaaran shaakaar ko mrityu-dand bhi detaa he
 But Shakar is also forgiven at the behest of Charudatta
 pativrata dhoota charudatt ke liye mrityu-dand kaa samachar sunakar agni-pravesh ko tatpar ho uthati he, charudatt upasthit hokar is dukhad ghatana ko roktaa he
 King Aryak pleases Vasantasena with the title of 'bride'
 bhikshu samvahak ko sab viharon kaa kulapati bana diya jaataa he
 The slave settler is freed from slavery, the chanters who give death penalty are made the chiefs of the chandalas, even the shakaras are given tribute
 in sukhad ghatnaon ke saath naatak samaapt hota he
 Not only is the story of Mruthaktik very interesting, but the character of the poet's characterization is very high
 yadhyapi isamen pradhan ras vipralambh shringaar he tathaapi hasya, karuna, bhayanak evam vatsalya jaise hridayahari vividh rason kaa sahaj saamanjasy he
 Its value has also been judged very much by Western mystics when tested from the point of view of Greek theater
 isaki bhashaa prasad gun se sampann ho atyant pranjal he
 The philosophy of the various forms of Prakrit is seen in it- In addition to Oriya, Magadhi and Shaurseni, the best examples of Prakrit Maharashtri and Avanti are available here
 grearsan ke anusaar is prakaran main shaakaari vibhaasha main takki praakrit kaa bhi prayog paaya jaataa he
 The poet has given special attention to Madhuri and Arthayavakthi in Shabchayan, due to which the Avanti and Vaidarbhi customs have been completely fulfilled
 mrichctic main do kathaayen hai
 One is Chauduttatta, the other is Aryak
 gunanty kii brihatkatha main gopal darak aryak ke vidroh kii katha he
 Brihatkha was written in its original form in the Paischi language under the name of 'baddakha'
 isse prakat hota he ki yah naatak isvi pehali shatee yaa duusari shatee kaa he
 This drama holds its special place in Sanskrit literature
 isamen– These are its characteristics
 is naatak kii raajnneetik visheshta yah he ki isamen kshatriya raja bura bataaya gaya he
 gop-putra 'aryak' is a cowherd, whom the poet makes a king
 yadhyapi kavi varnashram ko maanata he, par vah gop ko hi raja banaata he
 It seems that this story is old and possibly this incident is some real event which has remained in the legend
 daspratha ke ladkadhaate samaaj kaa chithran bahut sundar hua he or yah hamen chanakya ke samay main miltaa he, jab ‘arya’ shabd ‘naagarik’ ke rup main prayukt miltaa he
 Some old legend may have descended into this legend in the later period of Chanakya
 buddha ke samay main vyapaariyon kaa utkarsh bhi kaaphi hua tha
 Then Ujjayini's kingdom was different, Kosala's separate
 yahan bhi ujjayini kaa varnan he
 At one point it seems that there was a feeling of unity of India even when it is said that 'aryak has conquered the whole earth' - the earth whose Kailas flag is
 dekha jaae to kavi yathartwaadee tha or nishpaksh tha
 He has shown the good and evils of all and has depicted it very deeply
 yahi uski safalataa kaa kaaran he
 It is considered to be the work of Maharaja Shudraka who, like Bhasa and Kalidas, has become a king poet
 mrichctic isvi pratham shatee ke lagbhag kii rachana kahi ja sakati he
 It is said that Bhasparnit 'charudatta' has been modified by adding a story of a Chaturangi metaphor by a later Shudra poet
 vastut: isaki kathavstu kaa aadhaar brihatkatha or kathasaritsagar main varnit kathaon main miltaa he
 Ujjayini is the center of the story of 'mritchkatik'
 vah itnaa bada nagar he ki patliputra kaa samvahak uski prasiddhi sunakar basane ko, dhandha praapt karne ko, aata he
 At that time he does not call Pataliputra a metropolis
 iskaa matlab he ki us samay patliputra se adhik mahatv ujjayini kaa tha
 Apparently Pataliputra was Pataliputra in Buddha's time, while Mahasen Chand at Ujjayini was a prosperous kingdom of Pradyot
 duusari pracheenta he ki isamen das pratha bahut he
 The slave-maids were freed by giving money
 us samaaj main ganika bhi vadhoo ban jaati thi
 All these things belong to a society where there is no strictness, which started later
 balki kavi ne ganika ko vadhoo banaakar samaaj main ek nayaa adarsh rakhaa he
 There is a sense of rebellion in him
 atyaachaari ko vah pashu kii tarah maravaata he, stri ko unchaa uthaata tathaa das sthaavarak ko azaad karata he
 It can be said that this drama, which is an episode in classical terms - is very important
 koun jaanata he, aise na jane kitne saamaajik naatak kaal ke gaal main kho gaye
 The Holocausts from the Huns to the Turks did not know how many texts and stones were burnt! mrichctic par anek tikaayen likhi gai

 Without intervention, a mother who is positive for hbsag has a 20% risk of infection by her offspring at birth
 yah jokhim 90% kii oonchai par chalaa jaataa he agar maan bhi hbeag ke liye sakaaratmak he
 HBV may be transmitted between family members within households, possibly by contact with the nominal membrane or secretion of mucous membranes or saliva containing HBV
 However, reported hepatitis b among at least 30% of adults may not be associated with an identifiable risk factor
 hepatitis bi virus hepadnevyrus parivaar kaa sadsy he
 Virus particles are made up of an extracellular nucleocapsid core composed of an extracellular lipid envelope and a protein
 newcleocapcid viral diene or diene polimirej ko jodta he jisamen reverse transcripates gatividhi hoti he
 The outer envelope contains embedded proteins that are involved in viral binding and entry into susceptible cells
 virus 42 emen ke virian vyas se yukt ek band pashu virus he, lekin crod ko anupasthit kar philaments or golakaar sharir ko shaamil karte hue, pliomarfic rup maujuud rahete hai
 These particles are not infectious and are made up of lipids and proteins that form the surface part of the virion, called surface antigen, and are produced in large quantities during the life cycle of the virus

 DNA polymerase is coded by gene P
 jin s aise jin hai jo sataha antigen ke liye code karte hai
 The hbsag gene is a long open reading frame but contains three inframe "starts" that divide the gene into three classes, pre-s1, pre-s2 and S
 Because of the diverse start codons, there are three variants called long, medium and short
 Shaped polypeptides are produced
 jin eks dwaara kodit protein kaa kaary puri tarah se gyaat nahin he, lekin yah liver cancer ke vikaas se judaa hota he
 It stimulates genes that promote cell growth and inactivate the molecules that regulate growth
 hepatitis bi virus kaa jivan chakra jatil he
 Hepatitis b is one of the few known non-retroviral viruses that use reverse transcription as part of their replication process
 koshika kii sataha par ek agyaat receptor se judaav ke dwaara virus koshika main pravosh karte hai tathaa endocytosis ke dwaara ise pravisht karaata he
 Because the virus is produced by a host enzyme multiplied via RNA, viral genomic DNA has to be transferred to the cell nucleus by a protein called chaperones
 aanshik rup se dugana dhansa hua viral diene tab puri tarah se dugana dhansa hua banaaya jaataa he or kovalently band chakree diene main sthanantarit kiya jaataa he jo chaar viral mrnas ke pratilekhan ke liye template ke rup main hajir rahata he

 The genotype is separated by at least 8% of its sequence and was first reported in 1988 when images were interpreted
 Two later types have been explained so far
 Most genotypes with distinct properties are divided into subgenotypes
 ginotip adhiktar praaia: america, africa, bharat or pashchimi europe main paaya jaataa he
 Genotype b is most commonly found in Asia and the United States
 ginotip B1 japan main haaavee he, bi2 china or vietnam main jabaki bi3 indonesia main simit he
 B4 is limited to Vietnam
 ye sabhi upbhed serotip ayw1 ko nirdisht karte hai
 B5 is the most common in the Philippines
 ginotip si asia main or sanyukt rajya america main sabase aam he
 Subgenotype C1 is common in Japan, Korea, and China
 C2 china, dakshin purv asia or bangladesh main aam he or C3 oshinia main

 Ayw3 specifying C4 is found in Aborigines of Australia
 ginotip di sabase aam rup main dakshini europe, bharat or sanyukt rajya america main paaya jaataa he or 8 upaprakaron main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Genotype d is also the most common type in Turkey
 D1-D4 ke bare main paribhaashit bhugolic vitaran kaa tarika kam spasht he jahaan ye sabajinotips vyapak rup se europe, africa or asia ke bheetar faile hue hai
 This may be due to their differences occurring earlier than xenotypes b and C

 The test to detect hepatitis b virus infection, called an assay, involves a serum or blood test that identifies either viral antigens or antibodies produced by the host
 in parakhon kii vyakhya jatil he
 Hepatitis b surface antigen is frequently used for the presence of this infection
 yah pehla pahachaane jane laayak viral antigen he jo sankraman ke dauraan prakat hota he
 However, at the beginning of an infection, this antigen may not be present and subsequently remain undetected as it is cleared by the host
 sankramak virian main viral jinom ko sanlagn karte hue ek bhitari "kor kan" bhi hota he
 The isahedral core particle is composed of 180 or 240 proteins per core, alternatively known as the hepatitis b core antigen hbcag
 isi 'windo' ke dauraan jisamen mejabaan sankramit rahete hai lekin safaltaapurvak vaayas ko saaf karte hai, hepatitis bi kor antigen ke liye igm antibody rog ke ekmaatr serological pramaan ho sakate hai
 Soon after hbeag appears another antigen called hepatitis b e will appear
 Traditionally, the presence of hbeag in the serum of the host is associated with much higher rates of viral replication and increases the efficacy; However, variants of hepatitis b virus do not produce 'E' antigen, so this rule is not always true
 sankraman ke prakritik course ke dauraan, hbeag ko saaf kiya ja saktaa he or 'i' antigen ke antibody turant baad paidaa hote hai
 This conversion is usually associated with a dramatic decline in viral replication
 agar mejabaan sankraman ko saaf karne main sakasham he, to aakhirkaar hbsag anapahchananeey ho jayega or iske baad hepatitis bi sataha ke igg antibody or kor antigen paidaa honge
 hbsag ko hataane or anti-hbs ke prakat hone ke bich ke samay ko windo avadhi kaha jaataa he
 a person negative for hbsag and positive for anti-hbc has either eradicated the infection or has already been vaccinated
 aise vyakti, jo kam se kam chah maheene ke liye hbsag sakaaratmak main rahete hai unhen hepatitis bi ke vaahak ke rup main mana jaataa he
 Carriers of the virus may have chronic hepatitis b that will be reflected by elevated serum alanine aminotransferase levels and liver inflammation, as revealed by biopsy
 vaahak jo nakaaratmak hbeag sankraman kii sthiti main serocanverted ho chuke hote he, vishesh rup se ve jinhone vyask ke rup main sankraman kaa abhigrahan kar liya he, unamem bahut kam viral bahulikaran hota he or is prakaar unamem lambii-avadhi kii jatilta yaa dusron main sankraman ke sancharan karne kaa khatra kam rahata he
 PCR testing has been developed to identify and measure HBV DNA known as viral load in therapeutic samples

 Individuals with a high viral load typically have ground glass hepatocytes on biopsy
 mauris hillman ke dwaara hepatitis bi virus ke sankraman kii rokthaam ke liye kai tikon kaa vikaas kiya gaya he
 They believe in a use of viral envelope proteins
 tikaa mulat: lambey samay tak hepatitis bi virus ke sankraman se grast rogiyon se praapt plasma se banaae gaye hai
 However, currently, it is made using a synthetic recombinant DNA technique that does not contain blood products
 You cannot catch Hepatitis b with this vaccine
 tikaakaran ke baad, hepatitis bi sataha antigen kai dinon ke liye serum main paaya ja saktaa he, ise tikaa antigenamiya ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The vaccine is administered in adults and infants in either two or three or four dose schedules that provide 85–90% protection to individuals

 Unlike hepatitis A, hepatitis b does not usually spread through food and water
 Instead, it is transmitted through the transmission of body fluids, so it is prevented by avoiding this type of transmission: unprotected sexual contact, transfusions, reuse of contaminated needles and syringes and during childbirth
 Vertical transmission
 Infants may be vaccinated at birth
 shi, at al ne dikhaaya ki dablyuechao anusanshit naejanm se shuru hone vaale sanyukt immunoprophilaxis, hepatysis bi immun globulin ke chote khuraaq ke baavjood, yaa garbhavastha ke baad ke dinon main sankramanata ke ek ucch str se yukt HBV vaahak maa main maukhik lamivudine, prabhavakaari evam surakshatmak dhang se HBV intrayutrin sancharan ko roktaa he, jo praarambhik str par HBV kii rokthaam ke liye ek nai antardrushti pradaan karata he
 Treatment of acute hepatitis b infection is usually not required as most adults spontaneously relieve the infection
 praarambhik antiveiral upachaar kii jarurat keval 1% se kam rogiyon ko ho sakati he, jinka sankraman bahut akramak course ikhtiyaar kar letaa he yaa jo immunokanpromiled hote hai
 On the other hand, for the treatment of chronic infection it may be necessary to reduce the risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer
 chronic rup se duraagrahpurvak unnat elanin aminotransfarej, liver kshati kaa ek marker or HBV DNA str yukt sankramit vyakti thirapy ke ummidwar hote hai
 Although none of the available drugs can eliminate the infection, they can prevent the virus from replicating and reduce liver damage
 vartmaan main, sanyukt rajya america main hepatitis bi sankraman ke saat medication ko license praapt he
 These include the antiviral drugs lamivudine, adefovir, tenofovir, telbivudine, and intakeavir, and two immune system modulators interferone alpha 2a and paginated interferon alfa-2a
 interferon kaa upyog, jise roj yaa hafte main teen din injection kii jarurat padati he, kii jagah lambey samay ke liye sakriy pegilated interferon ke dwaara le liya gaya, jise hafte main ek baar inject kiya jaataa he
 However, some individuals may react more than others and this may be due to the genotype of the infecting virus or the heredity of the patient
 ilaaj liver main viral pratikruti ko kam kar detaa he, jisase viral lod kam hota he
 Immediately born infants from hepatitis b carrier mothers can be treated with antibodies to the hepatitis b virus
 jab janm ke baarah ghante ke bheetar vaxin diya jaataa he, tab hepatitis abhigrahan kaa jokhim 90% kam ho jaataa he
 This treatment allows a mother to breastfeed her baby safely
 july 2005 main, e*star or singapore ke rashtriya vishvavidhyalay ke shodhakartaaon ne rogiyon main protein hetrogenius newcleear rebonucleoprotein k ke varg main rahane vaale ek diene protein or HBV pratikruti ke judaav ko pahachaanaa

 The effect of treatment varies between genotypes
 interferon upachaar ginotip e main 37% ke ek e antigen serocanvarsan dar utpaadit kar sakate hai lekin tip di main keval 6% serocanvarsan
 genotip bi ke paas tip e ke samaan serocanvarsan dar hai
 The sustained e antigen loss in Type a and b is ~ 45% after treatment but only 25–30% in Type c and D
 hepatitis bi virus ke sankraman yaa to teevr ho sakate hai yaa chronic 
 aatm-simit sankraman vaale vyakti hafte se maheene ke bheetar sankraman ko anayas khatm kar dete hai
 Children are less likely to eradicate infection than adults
 95% se adhik log jo vayaskon yaa umradraj bacchon ke rup main sankramit hai ve purnat: thik ho jate hai or virus se bachaav kii pratirakshatmakataa viksit kar lete hai
 However, for 30% of young children and only 5% of newborns who acquire the infection from their mothers at birth, this drop will remove the infection
 This population is at 40% risk of lifetime cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma

 US National Book Award Winner kaushitaki brahmanopanishad kaushitaki upanishad kaa puraa naam he
 It is a Rigvedic Upanishad
 kaushitaki upanishad rugveda ke kaushitaki brahman kaa ansh he
 It has a total of four chapters
 is upanishad main jeevatma or brahmalok, pranopasna, agnihotra, vividh upasnaayen, praantatv kii mahima tathaa surya, chandra, vidyut megh, akaash, vaayu, agni, jal, darpan or pratidhwani main vidyaman chaitanya tatv kii upasna par prakaash daalaa gaya he
 Finally, the nature of 'self-realization' and the fruit derived from its worship is considered
 pratham adhyay main gautam rishi evam garg rishi ke praputra chitra ke sanvaadon dwaara 'brahmagyaan' ke liye kiye jane vaale agnihotra tathaa uski falshruti par prakaash daalaa gaya he
 When the seeker reaches Brahmaloka after his death, he is confronted by Apsaras and Brahmaji seated on a strange wall
 vah unase baaten karata he
 This conversation is also known as 'pravink-vidya'
 garg rishi ke praputra, maharishi chitra, yajna karne kaa nishchay karke arun ke putr mahatma uddalak ko pradhan ruthvik ke rup main aamantrit karte hai, parantu muni uddalak swayan na jaakar apane putr shwethaketu ko yajna sampann karaane ke liye bhej dete hai
 Shwetketu arrives at the behest of his father and sits on a high seat
 tab chitra usase prashn karata he-'he gautamakumar! is lok main koi aisa aavarnayukt sthaan he, jahaan tum mujhe le jaakar rakh sakate ho yaa phir usamen bhi koi aisa sarvatha pruthak or vilakshan aavaran se shunya pad he, jisko jaanakar tum usee lok main mujhe pratishthit kar sakate ho?' Saying this, Shwetketu left the posture of sacrifice and asked his father - 'oh Father! How should i answer the question that Maharishi Chitra has asked me? Shwetketu repeated the question of the picture to his father
 tab uddalak rishi ne kaha-'putr! main bhi iskaa uttar nahin jaanata
 Both of us will achieve this learning only by walking into the Yajshala of Maharishi Chitra and studying it
 'tadnantar donon pita-putr prasiddh aaruni muni ke haath se samidha grahan karke jigyaasu-bhav se maharishi chitra ke paas gayi or kaha ki ve vidya-prapti hetu unke paas aaye hai
 The picture said- 'O Gautam! You are highly revered among Brahmins and possess theology; Because coming to me, you do not have even a little pride of your superiority
 main nishchay hi aapako iskaa bodh karaungaa
 Maharishi Chitra said- 'O Vipraver! The person who is going to perform the rituals of Agnihotri, they all go from this world towards Chandralok, that is, heaven, but the person who is enamored of heavenly happiness accepts Chandralok, all his virtues are destroyed and he again : Falls back to this earth, that is, he is reborn again
 use moksh nahin mil paata
 On the saying of Maharishi Chitra, Gautam Muni again asked - "O God! Tell me who i am Tell me the way to cross this Bhavsagar, so that i can be free from all the buildings
 ' maharishi chitra ne kaha-'he gautam! devyan maarg se jane vaala sadhak kramash: agnilok, vayulok, suryalok, varunalok, indralok va prajapatilok aadi chah lokon main se hota hua 'brahmalok' main pravesh kar paata he
 There is a large reservoir named 'ar' at the entrance of 'brahmaloka'
 yah jalashay kaam, krodh, moh aadi shatruon dwaara nirtit he
 Here, even a moment's ego and bondage of work, anger, greed etc
 destroy all the virtues of the seeker
 'isht' kii prapti main yah jalashay sabase badi baadha he, parantu jo ise paar kar letaa he, vah phir se paavan viraja nadi ke kinare pahunch jaataa he
 All his labor and old age are overcome by mere sight of Virja river
 usamen aage 'ilya' naamak vriksh aata he
 This is the city with beautiful groves, gardens, baoli, koop, lake, river and reservoir etc
 of many deities, which is surrounded by Virja river and crescent park
 ye sabhi man ko baar-baar mohane ke liye saamne aate hai, kintu jo sadhak inamen lipt na hokar aage bad jaataa he, use saamne hi brahma ji kaa ek vishaal devalayas dikhaai padataa he
 The name of this temple is 'aparajita'
 surya kii prakhar rashmiyon se yukt hone ke kaaran ise vijit karnaa atyant kathin he
 It is protected by the clouds, the yajna, the air and the sky-form Indra and Prajapati, but the one who defeats them enters Brahmaloka
 vahaan ek vishaal vaibhav-sampann sabha-mandap ke madhya 'vichkshna' naamak vedi par sarvashaktimaan pranaswaroop brahma ji ek ati sundar singhaasana par virajman dikhaai padate hai
 Apsaras named Vishwa Janani Amba and Ambavayvi are engaged in their service, who welcome the Brahmavetta seeker and ornate him and present him to Brahma Ji
 'is upanishad main ek atyant sundar roopak baandhakar devyan maarg se brahmalok tak pahunchane kaa maarg dikhaaya gaya he
 It is here that the sage says that the man traveling in the chariot sees the wheels of the chariot running, but he does not see the coincidence of the speed of the wheels from the ground
 isi prakaar brahmalok kii yatra karne vaala sadhak rath par baithkar din or raat ko to dekhtaa he, kaal kii gati ko bhi dekhtaa he, paap-punya ko bhi dekhtaa he, parantu vah unamem lipt nahin hota
 He attains 'brahma' only by staying away from them
 kaam, krodh, lobh, moh or ahankaar uske maarg ke baadhak nahin banataa
 Maharishi's picture further says - 'O Gautam! The seeker becomes a Brahmavetta and experiences Brahmagandha, Brahmaras, Brahmatej, Brahmayash and Brahmnad in all his senses
 tab brahma ji us brahmagyani se prashn karte hai-'tum koun ho?' us samay brahma ji dwaara puche gayi prashnon kaa uttar brahmagyani ko is prakaar dena chahie— In this way, after answering all the questions of Brahma Ji, Lord Brahma himself says to the seeker that the famous 'five great' waters are my place
 at: yah meraa lok bhi jal aadi tatva dwaara pradhan he
 You are my worshiper integral to me
 at: yah tumhaara bhi lok he
 'thus that seeker acquires both' Jiti 'and' Vyushti 'of Brahma
 'maharishi chitra ne is prakaar 'brahmagyaan' kaa upadesh dekar gautam rishi ko abhibhoot kiya
 Sage Gautama, along with his son Shvetketu, returned after bowing to the Maharishi picture
 is adhyay main 'prantatva' kii upasna or 'brahmavidya' ke vyaavhaarik paksh par prakaash daalaa gaya he
 In addition to this, 'suryopasana' to destroy his sins, for the son's skillful desire and protection, 'chandropasana', 'for good health', Somopasana, 'for salvation,' Pramanapasana 'and the son for his whole life While giving the burden of responsibility, 'sampradan Karma' has described very clearly
 prantatva kii upasnis adhyay main 'praan' ko hi 'brahm' kaa rup mana he
 Pran is conceived as a king
 'man' uskaa doot he, 'vaani' uski rani he, 'chakshu' uski suraksha karne vaale mantri hai, 'karnendriya' sandesh grahan karne vaale dwarpal hai
 As soon as the soul arrives, the service of all senses is automatically received by the king of life
 suprasiddh mahatma shushkabhingaar 'praan' ko hi brahm kaa rup sweekaar karte hai
 Therefore, the worship of life is going to give favored attainments
 jivan main shreshthata, sukh-samruddhi, yash, tejaswita tathaa gyaan pranopasna dwaara ho saktaa he
 Suryopasanakoshitki, through his experience, has said to perform Suryopasana thrice - morning, midday and evening
 unhone kaha he ki praat:kaal yagyopavit ko savy bhav se baayen kandhe par rakhkar aachman karen
 Then fill the water vessel thrice with pure water, offer arghya to the rising sun and chant this mantra - 'vardoshi in Vrgosi papamanam
 ' is prakaar madhyahnkaal main, bhagwaan bhaskar ko samaran karen or is mantra kaa uccharan karen-' udvargosi papmanan main sanvruddhi
 Similarly, in the evening, worship the sun while setting and chant this mantra - 'ॐ Vriddhogऽsī Papamanam
 ' is prakaar suryopasna karne se manushya ke din-raat ke saare paapon kaa shaman ho jaataa he, paap karm na karne kii shakti utpann ho jaati he
 In Chandropasana Avamasya, when the sun is located in the western part and the moon is situated in the moon named Sushumna, then by this method one should perform Chandropasana
 arghya dene vaale paatr main do hari durva ke ankur bhi avashya rakh len
 Then chanting this mantra while offering Arghya - 'yatte Susimam Hridayamadhi Chandramamsishritam Tenamritattasyeshane Mahan Potramyadam Rudam
 ' is prakaar kii prarthana se upaask putr shok se bachaa rahata he tathaa putr na hone kii sthiti main putr-ratna praapt kar letaa he
 Somopasana Rishi has considered Somopasana to be the reason for a healthy body
 vah som se prarthana karata he-'he stri-rupi som! tum purush-rupi surya ke prakaash se vikaas ko praapt ho
 Be helpful in getting food from all sides
 he som! tum saumy gunon se yukt ho
 By attaining the glory of the Sun, your divine juice becomes very beneficial for men
 tum is divya ras kaa seven karne vaale purushon ko pushti do or unke sabhi shatruon kaa paraabhav karaane main puri tarah se sahaayak bano
 Hey Mon! You can help in the attainment of immortality while achieving happiness with fiery glory and set your fame in heaven
 he som! main tumhaari hi gati kaa anugaman karte hue apni dahini bhujaa ko baar-baar ghumata hum
 'the sage calls Soma the five-faced Prajapati
 uskaa ek mukh 'brahman' he, doosraa mukh 'kshatriya' hai, teesraa mukh 'baj' pakshi he, chauthaa mukh 'agni' he
 And the fifth face you are yourself
 is prakaar som kii prarthana karne ke uparant garbhaadhan ke liye tatpar stri ke paas baithne se pehle uske hriday kaa sparsh karen or is mantra kaa paath karen—'yatte sumime hridaye hitmant: prajapathu manyehan maa tadvidwansan ten maahan pautramadhan rudam
 'this kind of prayer never leaves the seeker mourning the son
 rishi kaa sanket us mata kii ore he, jo apana doodh apni santaan ko pilaati he
 His milk has a somerset-like defensive force
 usee se balak swasth rahata he
 Mother's milk is a natural process for the child
 prakruti kaa virodh anekanek bhayanak parinaamon kaa kaaran ban jaataa he
 In the context of worshiping the mortal for salvation, the sage has shown the importance of life through a beautiful metaphor
 ek samay vaani aadi samast devtaa ahankaar ke vasheebhoot hokar apni-apni mahatt siddh karne ke liye paraspar vivaad karne lage
 Everyone was exited from the body with life
 unke nikal jane se sharir kashtha kii bhaanti chetana-rahit hokar so gaya
 'vani' entered the body alone to prove his supremacy
 vaani ke pravesh karte hi sharir vaani se bolne laga, lekin vah apane sthaan se uth nahin sakaa
 After this, the 'netriadriya' deity entered the body
 tab vah vaani se bolne or netron se dekhne laga, parantu is baar bhi vah uth nahin sakaa
 Then the 'shrotendiya' deity entered the body
 vah sunne laga, bolne bhi laga or dekhne bhi laga
 But even this time he could not get up, he was lying idle
 tatpashchaat us sharir main 'man' ne pravesh kiya
 Through the mind he became thinking, but this time also he could not get up
 tab sabase ant main 'praan' ne us sharir main pravesh kiya
 The body got up and sat as soon as that nature entered
 isse praanon kaa mahatva sarvopari siddh ho gayaan sabhi anya indriyon ne praan main hi, moksh aadi sadhana kii shakti ko sweekaar kiya
 He learned that immortality can be attained only by life and this body can rise up and go towards heaven
 praanon ke dwaara hi, sharir kii samast chetnaayen or indriyaan kaary karti hai
 Therefore, it is due to the association of Brahman by the worship of souls
 praanon ke dwaara hi vishisht gyaan-swaroop parabrahm ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Sampradaya-karma by the father This chapter mentions the process of the father's succession to his son
 rishi kaa kahana he ki apana antim samay aayaa jaanakar, pita ko apane sampoorn uttardayitvon se mukt ho janaa chahie or jo kuch bhi uske paas he, use apane putr ko saunp dena chahie
 The son should also gladly accept the obligation left by his father
 pita ko chahie ki shubhr vastra dhaaran karke apane putr ko apane paas bulaaye or usase kahe-'he putr! main tumhen apni vaak shakti, apane praan, apane netra, apane kaan, apane rasaswadan, apane samast shreshth karm, apane sukh-du:kha, apni maithunjnya shakti tathaa rati-sukh, apni gatishiltaa, apni samast icchhaaen, apni buddhi, apana yash, brahmatej ou apana shreshth swasthya tathaa ann ko pachaane kii shakti aadi sabhi sadgun pradaan karata hum yaa tumhaare bheetar pratishthit karata hoon
 'when the father says this, the son should accept him politely and look towards his left shoulder and with his hands, he will say -' Father! You can get the heaven you desire and all the pleasures there
 ' iske uparant, yadi pita nirog ho, to vah apane putr ko ghar kaa swami banaakar athwa maanakar uske saath nivas kare yaa phir sabhi kuch tyagkar va ghar chhodkar sanyas kaa jivan bitaaye
 Such a father is about to turn to the divine when the time comes
 vastav main uttaradhikaar kaa sahi niyam yahi he
 In this chapter, the sage has given a detailed description of Prana, Pragya and Indri and analyzed their mutual relations
 iske liye samvaad-style kaa sahaara liya gaya he
 Here, through the interactions between Indra and Divodas Raja's son Pratardan, Prana has been described as a form of wisdom and has said that public interest is possible only with this wisdom
 ek baar devasur sangram main, devaataaon kii sahaayta ke liye raja divodas ke putr pratardan swarglok gayi the
 Pleased with his unique martial arts and valor, Indra wanted to give him a boon
 is par pratardan ne kaha-'he devraj! jis shreshth var ko aap maanav-jati ke liye param kalyanyukt maanate hon, vaisaa hi koi shreshth var aap swayan hi mujhe pradaan karen
 After listening to Pratardan, Devraj Indra said - 'rajan! There is no person in this world who asks for a bride for the happiness of others
 aap koi aisa var maangen, jo aapke apane liye ho?'is par pratardan ne koi bhi var grahan karne se inkaar kar diya
 Seeing King Pratardan's ascension of truth, Devraj Indra said - "O Rajan! You know me, my true form? This is the best boon for mankind
 'devraj ke is kathan main pratardan ne pahachaanaa ki indra ne na jane kitne pathbhrasht asuron or rishi-muniyon ko dand diya, par ahankarviheen or nishkaami hone ke kaaran indra kaa bal bhi baankaa nahin hua
 Then he understood that the life which is lived, while doing unarmed deeds and outright ego, is only for human welfare
 at: lok-kalyankari vyakti ke liye nirabhimani or nishkaam karmi hona param aavashyak he
 Only such a person can achieve the true form of Indra, that is, the soul-like soul, and even the greatest of sinful acts cannot affect him
 yadi daivik pravritiyon kii raksha ke liye kisi aattaayi vyakti kaa vadh bhi karnaa pade, to uskaa bhi paap nahin lagata
 Devraj Indra preached to Pratardan and said that whoever recognizes my true nature, never feels a sin; Because, 'I myself am a form of wisdom
 ' indra aage kahata he ki us praan tathaa shreshth gyaan se yukt aatmaswaroop ke rup main prakhyat, mujh indra kii, tum aayu ou amrit-rup se upasna karo
 He makes it clear that age is life, life itself is life, and life itself is immortality
 is sharir main jab tak praan he, tabhi tak aayu he
 It is through this nature that the seeker goes to another world and attains the special pleasure of amritattattva
 jo vyakti 'aayu' or 'amrit' ke rup main indra kii upasna karata he, vah is lok main purnayu ko praapt karata he or swarg ke sukhon kaa paan karata he
 The importance of life in the body is of paramount importance
 yadi praan ke rahete sharir kaa koi ang nasht ho jaye, to bhi sharir jivit rahata he, parantu praan ke na rahane par, ek kshan bhi sharir kaa jivit rahanaa asambhav he
 Prana is the person who realizes action power
 praan hi gyaan main pravriti hone kii shakti detaa he
 It has been called 'pragya-swaroop Prana' or 'atma'
 at: jivan ke utthan ke liye pragna-swaroop is praan kii hi upasna kerani chahie
 Pragya and Prana both reside together in the body and leave this body together with the soul
 pranamya parabrahm kaa yahi darshan he or yahi vigyaan he
 This worship is the main source of public welfare
 sushupt avasthaa main, jab manushya soya hua hota he, tab sabhi indriyaan or gyaan, praan main samahit ho jate hai
 But when he awakens, then all kinds of knowledge, coming out of the soul, merge into their senses and the latent senses become aware
 ise upanishad main maranasann vyakti ke udhaaharan se samajhaayaa he
 a person who is in a dying state, his whole consciousness power leaves the senses and merges into the soul
 us samay vah na to sunata he, na dekhtaa he, na bolta he, ne haath-pair hilaa paata he, na uskaa mastishk hi kaam karata he
 This is the position of a meditation practitioner
 parantu jab vah maranasann vyakti rogon se chhutkaaraa paakar pun: jivit ho uthta he athwa vah dhyansth yogi phir se sahaj jivan main laut aata he, tab unki samast indriyaan apane-apane swabhaav ke anusaar phir se sajag ho uthati hai
 Be guided by the mind
 praan hi sarvapratham 'man' ko jaagrath karata he
 He controls and controls all the senses
 man kaa sidhaa sambandh 'pragna' se he or pragna kaa praan se
 In this way Prana, Pragya and Indri are interdependent
 praantatv se hi pragna he or pragna se hi samast indriyon ko sanchaalan hota he
 When 'prana' which is released from the body, it reverses, then at that time, it reverses with all these senses
 vaani sabhi naamon kaa, naak sabhi gandhon kaa, chakshu sabhi roopon kaa, kaan sabhi dhvaniyon kaa or man sabhi dhyansth vishyon kaa parityag kar detaa he
 Therefore, the soul is the soul and the wisdom is the soul who resides in this body simultaneously
 sharir kii samast indriyon kaa parichaalan inhen ke dwaara hota he
 It is through wisdom that he attains cognition according to the nature of all the senses
 pragna ke abhaav main sabhi kaa astitv naganya ho jaataa he
 Without Prana or Pragya, no form, subject or sense can be attained
 jis prakaar rath kii nemi aron ke or are rath kii naabhi ke ashrith hote hai, usee prakaar ke samast indriyaan, pragna ke dwaara hi vidyaman hai
 This wisdom or life is the blissful and immortal form of God
 yah na to achche kaam se vruddhi paata he ou na bure kaary se sankuchit hota he
 It is paradoxical
 yah samast lokon kaa adhipati he or sabakaa swami he
 This soul is our soul
 ise jaanakar hi paramatma kii upasthiti ko anubhav kiya ja saktaa he
 In this chapter, based on the conversation between a Brahmin sage named Gargya and the scholar King Ajatshatru of Kashi, the various powers of the universe have been mentioned in the dialogue style and accepted the 'soul' as 'brahma'
 garg gotra main utpann balaaka rishi ke putr kaa naam gargy rishi ke naam se prasiddh tha
 He was a brilliant scholar of the four Vedas
 ushinar pradesh unka nivasasthaan tha
 He often used to travel in different regions of the country
 kabhi matsay desh main, to kabhi kuru-paanchal main rahane pahunch jate the
 Once while wandering, he reached the Dabar of King Ajatshatru, the scholar of Kashi
 vahaan ve atyant ahankaarpurn vaani main raja se bole-'he rajan! main aapako 'brahmatatv' kaa upadesh duungaa
 On saying such a sage of Gargya, Kashi King Ajatshatru said - 'O Vipravar! For your preaching, i will give you a millenium with a good quality
 mujhe to prasannataa he ki ab tak brahmavidya ke shrota or dani ke rup main mithila naresh janak kaa hi naam tha
 Today, you have come to us and enhanced our pride like Videha Rajak
 ' 'brahmatatva' kaa upadesh dete hue rishi gargy or ajatshatru ke madhya is saprkaar vaartalap hua-rishi gargy—'he rajan! is suryamandal main jo antaryami parameshwar sthit he, main brahmabuddhi se usee kii sadhana karata hum
 'ajatashatru —' o Brahman! It's not like this
 yah shwet vastradhari surya to sabhi se mahaan he
 It is the head of all, centered in the highest position
 jo manushya is viraat purush kii is prakaar se aradhana karata he, vah sabase ucch sthiti main pahunchataa he
 'rishi Gargya -' o Rajan! In the lunar circle, who is this transcendental great man, i worship him as Brahman
 'ajatshatru-'he vipravar! aisa nahin he
 This is the king of Soma and this is also the soul of the food main isi prakaar isaki upasna karata hum
 Whoever worships in this way, surely becomes the soul of the grain and the money is filled with grain
 'rishi gargy-'he rajan! vidyut mandal ke antargat yah jo antaryami viraat parabrahm he, main usee kaa upaask hum
 'ajatashatru-' o Vipravar! It's not like this
 main is vidyut ko 'prakaash kii aatma' maanakar isaki upasna karata hum
 Whoever worships in this way, he himself becomes a 'soul' in the form of light
 'rishi gargy-' he rajan! megh mandal main garjana ke rup main vidyaman us antaryami ishwar ko main saakshaat brahm maanata hum
 ‘ajatashatru —’ o Vipravar! Don't say that main shabd kii aatma samajhakar hi is shreshth tatva kii upasna karata hum
 One who worships it in this way turns into the soul of the word itself
 'rishi gargy ne phir kaha-'he rajan! akaash mandal main pratishthit parabrahm parameshwar kii main avinashi brahm ke rup main upasna karata hum
 'ajatashatru replied -' o Vipravar! i do not want to say anything about this
 yah to purna, pravriti-rahit brahm, sabhi se vishaal he
 Of course i worship it in this form
 jo aise divya brahm kii upasna karata he, vah samast praaniyon main nirvikaar ho jaataa he
 He does not die before time
 'isi prakaar vaarta ko aage badhaate hue gargy rishi ne vayumandal main sthit viraat purush ko brahm kaha, par ajatshatru ne use indra ke shreshth aishwarya se yukt vaikuntha kaha, jahaan kunthaayen nasht ho jaati hai ou vah sadaiv aparajit rahata he
 After that the sage gave the Virat Purush in the Agni Mandala, the Virat Purush present in the hydrosphere, the Virat Purush reflected in the mirror, the sound in the resonance, the phonetic word rising behind the dynamic Virat Purush, the shadow of the bodily, in the body Situated Virat Purusha, Prana-natured soul with wisdom, Virat Purush in right eye, Virat Purush in left eye
 By present as indestructible Brahman, spoke to worship him
 parantu ajatshatru ne kramash: sabhi ko nakaarte hue agni ko dusron kaa prahaar sahan karne vaala 'vishasahi,' jal main sthit brahm ko namdhari jeevatma, pratibimb ko praturup, pratidhwani ko gati kaa abhavayukt, dhvanyatmak shabd ko 'pranaswaroop', sharir kii chaaya ko mrityu-rup, sharir main sthit viraat purush ko prajapati kaa swaroop, pragna se yukt aatma ko yama kaa swaroop, daahine netra main sthit purush ko naam, agni or jyoti kii aatma, baayen netra main sthit purush ko satya, vidyut or tej kaa aatma bataaya or usee rup main unki upasna karne kii baat kahi
 Hearing of Ajatashatru, the sage Garga became silent and accepted Ajatashatru as his guru, but being a Kshatriya, Ajatashatru did not accept making disciples of Brahmin Gargya
 haa, ekaant main unhen unhen brahm kaa gyaan avashya karaayaa
 They took him to a sleeping person and tried to awaken him by calling him by many names, but when he did not wake up, Ajatshatru picked him up by hitting him with a stick
 uske jaagane par ajatshatru ne rishi gargy se kaha-'he vipravar! yah vyakti is prakaar achet hokar kahaan sota tha or kis pradesh main yah tha or ab jaagane ke baad yah kahaan aa gaya he?' rishi gargy is rahasy ko nahin samaj sake, to raja ajatshatru ne pun: kaha-'rishiver! yah purush jahaan sota tha, vah sthaan praan-rupi hridayakamal he
 There is a famous pulse named 'hita'
 uske dwaara hriday kaa vistaar sampoorn naadiyon tak he, jo bal ke hajaarwein bhaag se bhi sookshm he
 In these channels, the male is situated at bedtime
 is soye hue purush ke hriday main sthit 'praan' kaa sabhi indriyon se sambhaav he
 This life is the shell of the soul
 yah pragnavan aatma isi khol main sookshm rup se usee prakaar virajman rahati he, jaise lakdi kii myaan main talwaar rahati he
 This 'soul' activates the entire 'spirituality' when a man is awake
 tab us 'sakshi-rup aatma' kaa sabhi indriyaan anumat sevak kii bhaanti anusaran karti hai
 The knower, who knows this 'soul', like Indra, by destroying all his enemy asuras or sins, attains the best rank of Triloki
 at: 'aatma' ko jaanane ke liye ahankaar kaa tyaag param aavashyak he
 Only then can he destroy his sins
 angoor ek fal he
 Grapes are a strong and beautiful fruit
 angoor fal maan ke doodh ke samaan poshak he
 Grape is considered the best in fruits
 yah nirbal-sabal, swasth-aswasth aadi sabhi ke liye samaan upyogi hota he
 It grows in large bunches on grape vines
 angoor sidhe khaaya bhi ja saktaa he, yaa phir usase anguri sharaab bhi banaayi ja sakati he, jise haalaa kehete hai, yah angoor ke ras kaa khamirikaran karke banaayi jaati he
 Grapes are a strong and beautiful fruit
 angoor fal maan ke doodh ke samaan poshak he
 Grape is considered the best in fruits
 yah nirbal-sabal, swasth-aswasth aadi sabhi ke liye samaan upyogi hota he
 There are many diseases in which no substance is given to the patient
 usamen bhi angoor fal diya ja saktaa he
 The ripe grapefruit has a cold, sweet and aloe
 yah spor ko shuddh banaata he tathaa aankhon ke liye hitkar hota he
 Grapes are seminal, blood cleansing, blood boosting and reducing fruit
 angoor main jal, sharkara, sodium, potacium, citric acid, faloride, potacium sulphate, magnesium or louh tatv bharpoor maatra main hote hai
 Grapes are very useful for removing the weakness of the heart
 hvaday rogi ko niyamit angoor khaane chahie
 Consumption of grapes removes phlegm stored in the lungs, it also helps in cough
 angoor ji michalaanaa, ghabrahat, chakkar aane vaali bimariyon main bhi laabhadaayak he
 Use of grapes is also beneficial in respiratory diseases and air diseases
