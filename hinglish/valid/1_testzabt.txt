 Sagan has written frequently about religion and the relationship between religion and science, expressing his doubts about the traditional concept of God, a superior being
 udhaaharan ke liye: Some believe that God is a light-skinned male with a staggered white beard, working together with the fall of every chimney wherever he is seated in the sky on a throne

 From some hidden astronomical point of view of human beings, there is no compelling evidence for the human patriarch controlling the fate of humans, but to deny the existence of physical laws would be insane

 This God is emotionally satisfying

 The Quran, the Quran or Koran is the holiest book of Islam and its foundation
 musalmaan maanate hai ki ise allaah ne farishte jibril dwaara hazarat mohammad ko sunaaya tha
 Muslims believe that the Quran is the last and supreme book sent by Allah
 yah granth lagbhag 1400 saal pehle avataran hui he
 According to the beliefs of Islam, Hazrat Muhammad was revealed by the Qur'an Allah's angel Jibril until his death in 61032
 haalanki aarambh main iskaa prasar maukhik rup se hua par pigambar mohammad kii maut ke baad san 633 main ise pehali baar likhaa gaya tha or san 653 main ise manakikrut kar isaki pratiyaan islamic samrajya main vitarit kii gayi thi
 Muslims believe that the last of the holy messages sent by God are written in the Quran
 in sandeshon kii shuruyaat aadam se hui thi
 Hazrat Adam was the earliest prophet in Islamic beliefs and can be compared to an extent with the Manu of Hinduism
 jis tarah se hindu dharm main manu kii santanon ko maanav kaha gaya he vaise hi islam main aadam kii santanon ko aadmi kaha jaataa he
 Tauheed, religious order, Jannat, Jahannam, Patience, Dharma are subjects of perenniality which were repeated again and again

 keval yahi nahin usne registan ke anpadh logon ko aisa sabhy bana diya ki puure vishwa par is sabhyataa kii chhap se saikadon varshon baad bhi iske nishaan pakke milte hai
 The Quran presented the ideals of war, peace, state governance, family, which have influence in human society today
 musalamaanon ke anusaar kuran main die gaye gyaan se ye sabit hota he ki hazarat mohammad ek islamic pigambar nabi he | The first mention of the word "qur'an" is found in the Qur'an itself where it means - he read, or he read
 yah shabd iske syrian samanaantar courienna kaa arth letaa he jiskaa arth hota he granthon ko padhanaa
 Although Westernists associate it with the Syrian word, most Muslims believe that its root is the word Qur'a
 par chaahe jo hazarat mohammad ke janmdin ke samay hi yah ek arabi shabd ban gaya tha
 The word has been mentioned some 70 times in the Qur'an itself
 iske alaave bhi koran ke kai naam hai
 It has also been addressed by names such as Al Furaqan, Al Hikmah, Dhikr / Zikr and Mashhaf
 koran main allaah ne 25 ambia kaa zikr kiya he
 The word Quran appears about 70 times in the Quran, which assumes different meanings
 yah arabi kriya qara kaa ek maukhik sangya he, jiskaa arth he "vah padhata he"
 Syriac is the equivalent qarayana, which refers to "reading scripture" or "lesson"
 jabaki kuch pashchimi vidwaan is shabd ko siriek se praapt karne par vichaar karte hai, muslim adhikariyon ke bahumat main shabd kii utpatti qara hi hoti he
 Regardless, it had become an Arabic word during Muhammad's lifetime
 shabd kaa ek mahatvapurn arth "paath kaa kaary" he, jaisaa ki praarambhik kurani maarg main darshaya gaya he: "yah hamaare liye ise ikattha karnaa or ise padhanaa he 
 In other verses, the term refers to "a personal passage"
 iskaa kai sandarbh main kai prakaar se adab kiya jaataa he
 As an example: "when al-quran is recited, listen to it and be silent
 " anya dharmon ke granth jaise torah or susamachar ke saath varnit arth bhi grahan kar saktaa he
 The word also has synonyms which are employed throughout the Quran
 prayek samanaarthi kaa apana alag arth hota he, lekin iskaa upyog kuch sandarbhon main quran ke saath mil saktaa he
 In such words the book, Ayah; And sura
 baad ke do shabd bhi prakaashan kii ikaayiyon ko darshaate hai
 In the large majority of references, usually with a definite article, the term is referred to as "publication", which has been "sent" at intervals
 anya sambandhit shabd hai: dhikkaar, quran ko ek anusmarak or chetavanee ke arth main sanderbhit karata he, or hikmah, kabhi-kabhi prakaashan yaa iske hisse kaa zikr karata he
 The Quran describes itself as "prudence", "mother of texts", "guide", "wisdom", "remembrance"
 or "rahasyodghatan" 
 Another word is al-kitab, although it is also used in Arabic for other scriptures, such as the Torah and the Bible
 musahaf shabd kaa prayog aksar vishesh kuranik lipiyon ke sandarbh main kiya jaataa he lekin quran main bhi pehle kii kitabon kii pahchaan karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 Islamic tradition relates that Muhammad received his first revelation during his prayer in the cave of Hira on the mountains
 iske baad, unhen 23 varshon kii avadhi main puraa koran kaa khulaasa praapt hua
 According to the hadith and Muslim history, after Muhammad came to Medina and formed an independent Muslim community, he ordered many of his companions to read the Quran and learn and teach the laws, which were told daily
 yah sambandhit he ki kuch kurash jinhen badr kii ladaai main kaidiyon ke rup main le jaaya gaya tha, unhone kuch musalamaanon ko us samay ke saral lekhan ko sikhaye jane ke baad apni aazaadee hasil kar lee
 Thus a group of Muslims gradually became literate
 jaisaa ki shuru main kaha gaya tha, quran ko takhton, khaalon, haddiyon, or ke tane ke chaude lakadiyon par darj kiya gaya tha
 Most suras were in use among Muslims as they have been mentioned in many hadiths and histories by both Sunni and Shia sources, relating to Muhammad's use of the Quran as a call to Islam, as a way of praying and reading
 haalanki, quran 632 main mohammad kii mrityu ke samay pustak rup main maujuud nahin tha
 There is an agreement among scholars that Muhammad himself did not write the revelation
 sahih al-bukaari haddees main mohammad ko rahasyodghatan kaa varnan karte hue bataaya, "kabhi-kabhi yah ghanti bajane kii tarah " or aaisha ne bataaya, "maine dekha ki paigambar bahut hi thande din main vahi se prerit ho rahe hai or unke maathe se pasinaa nikal rahaa tha
 As soon as the inspiration of the same was over, his restlessness would go away
 " quran ke anusaar mohammad kaa pehla prakaashan, ek drushti ke saath tha
 The medium of revelation is described as "a powerful one", a person who was "on the topmost horizon when clear to see
 phir vah nikat aa gaya or mohammad se baat karne laga
 "islamic study scholars state in the Welch encyclopedia that they believe that Muhammad's condition and descriptions at these moments can be considered real, as he was severely disturbed after these revelations
 velch ke mutabik, mohammad kii preranaon kii atimanvi utpatti ke liye unke aas-paas ke logon ne in daure ko dekha hoga
 However, Muhammad's critics accused him of being a person, a poet, or a magician because his experiences were similar to those claimed by such figures in ancient Arabia
 velch atirikt rup se bataata he ki yah anishchit he ki mohammad ke bhavishyavaaniyon ke praarambhik daawey se pehle yaa baad main ye anubhav hue the
 The Quran describes Muhammad as "ummi", which is traditionally interpreted as "uneducated", but its meaning is more complex
 madhyakaalin tippaneekaron jaise al-tabari ne kaha ki is shabd ne do arthon ko prerit kiya: pehla, saamaanya rup se padhane yaa likhane main asamarthta; doosraa, pichhali kitabon yaa granthon kii anubhavheenata yaa agyanta 
 Muhammad's illiteracy was taken as an indication of the reality of his prophecy
 udhaaharan ke liye, fakhruddin al-raji ke anusaar, yadi mohammad ne lekhan or padhai main maharath hasil kii thi to sambhawatah unhen purvajon kii kitabon kaa adhyayan karne kaa andeh hota
 Some scholars, like Watt, prefer the second meaning of "ummi" - they first take it to indicate unfamiliarity with sacred texts
 quran kii antim aayat varsh 10veen hijri main dhu al-hijjah ke islamic maheene ke 18 veen tarikh ko prakat hui thi, jo ek taarikh he jo mote taur par farvari yaa march 632 se mail khaati he 
 This was revealed after the Prophet gave his sermon in Ghadir e Khumm
 632 main mohammad kii mrityu ke baad, unke kai saathi jo quran ko kanthst jaanate the, musalimaa dwaara yamama kii ladaai main maare gaye the
 The first Khalifa, Abu Bakr, later decided to gather the book into a book to preserve it
 zayd ebn thabit quran ko ikattha karne vaale pehle vyakti the kyonki vah allaah ke nabi mohammad se padhe gaye aaayaaton or suron ko likhaa karte the
 Thus, the most important of the classical group, Zaid bin Thabit, collected verses and compiled the entire book to give the Qur'an the form of a book
 is tarah quran ek granth ke rup main aagai or uski prati abu bakr ke saath hi rahi
 For this work, Zaid has cropped all the pages which were written on the bone, on the leaves, on the stones and many people had memorized them
 abu bakar ke baad, mohammad kii vidhwaa hafasa bint umr ko lagbhag 650 main is pandulipi ko saunpa gaya tha
 The third Caliph Uthman ibn Afan began to notice slight differences in the pronunciation of the Quran as Islam spread beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia, the Levant, and North Africa
 paath kii pavitrataa ko sangrakshit karne ke liye, unhone jayad kii adhyakshata main ek samiti kaa aadesh diya taaki abu bakar kii pratilipi kaa upyog kiya ja sake or quran kii ek maanak prati taiyaar kii ja sake
 Thus, within 20 years of Muhammad's death, the Quran was committed in written form
 yah paath us model ban gaya jahaan se muslim duniya ke shahari kendron main pratiyaan banaai gayi or prakshepit kii gayi, or anya sanskarnon ko nasht kar diya gaya mana jaataa he
 The current form of Quran recitation is considered by Muslim scholars to be the original version compiled by Abu Bakr
 shiya ke anusaar, ali ebn abi talib ne mohammad kii mrityu ke turant baad quran kaa ek purna sanskaran sankalit kiya
 The sequence of this text was gathered later during Uthman's era that this version was collected in chronological order
 iske baavjood, unhone manakikrut quran ke khilaaf koi aapatti nahin kii or quran ko parisancharan main sweekaar kar liya
 Other individual copies of the Quran may exist, including the codecs of Ibn Mas'ud and Ube ibn Ka'b, none of which exist today
 quran mohammad ke jeevankaal ke dauraan bikhri hui likhit rup main sabase adhik sambhaavna he
 Several sources indicate that a large number of his companions had missed the revelation during Muhammad's lifetime
 praarambhik tippaniyan or islamic aitihaasik strot quran ke shuruaati vikaas kii uparyukt samaj kaa samarthan karte hai
 The Quran in its current form is generally considered by academic scholars to record the words spoken by Muhammad as the discovery of variants has not given much importance
 chicago vishvavidhyalay ke professor fred donor ne kaha ki "


 quran ke ek samaan vyanjan paath ko sthapit karne kaa ek bahut hi shuruaati prayaas tha, jo sambhawatah sancharan main sambandhit granthon kaa ek vyapak or adhik vividh samooh tha
 After the creation of this standardized canonical text, the first official texts were suppressed, and all existing manuscripts — despite their many variants — seem to date back to a time after the establishment of this standard consonant text
 " haalanki quran ke paath ke adhikansh sanskaran reeding ko prasaarit karnaa band kar diya gaya he, kuch abhi bhi hai
 There has been no significant text on which a scholarly reconstruction of the Quranic text can be based
 aitihaasik rup se, quran kii saamagree par vivaad shaayad hi kabhi ek mudda ban gaya he, haalanki is vishay par bahes jari he
 In 1972, in a mosque in the city of Sana'a, Yemen, manuscripts were discovered that later proved to be the oldest Quranic text existing at the time
 sanaa kii pandulipiyon main ek prishth he jisamen se charmpatr pun: prayojya banane ke liye dhoyaa gaya he- ek abhyaas jo pracheen samay main lekhan saamagree kii kami ke kaaran aam tha
 However, the faint washed-out underlying text is still barely visible and is considered "pre-uthmanic" Quranic content, while the text written at the top is considered Uthmanic time
 radiocarbon dating kaa upyog karne vaale adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki charmpatr 671 sii se pehle kii avadhi ke liye 99 pratishat sambhaavna ke saath dinaankit hai
 In 2015, very early Quran fragments dating back 1370 years were discovered in the library of the University of Birmingham, England
 oxford uniwarsity radiocarbon excelerator unit dwaara kiye gaye pareekshanon ke mutabik, "95% se adhik kii sambhaavna ke saath, charmpatr 568 or 645 ke bich tha"
 The manuscript is written in the Hijaji script, an early form of Liza Arabic
 yah sambhawatah quran kaa sabase purana udhaaharan he, lekin pareekshanon kii ek vistrut taarikh kii anumati he, isliye yah nishchit rup se nahin kaha ja saktaa ki maujuuda sanskarnon main se koun sa sabase purana he
 Saudi scholar Saud al-sarhan has expressed doubts over the age of the fragments because they contain dots and chapter separators that are believed to have originated later
 muslimon kaa maananaa he ki quran 23 saal kii avadhi main allaah ne jibril ke madhyam se ishwar se mohammad se divya maargdarshan kii pustak ban gaya he or quran ko maanavtaa ke liye bhagwaan ke antim prakaashan ke rup main dekhtaa he
 Revelation in Islamic and Quranic contexts means the act of God addressing a person, sending a message to a large number of recipients
 jis prakriya se ishwar ke sandeshvahak ke dil main divine sandesh aata he vah tanzil yaa nuzul he
 As the Quran states, "with the truth we have sent it down and with the truth it has come down
 " The Quran often emphasizes in its text that it is divinely ordained
 quran main kuch chand yah ingit karte hai ki arabi bolne vaale bhi log quran ko samajhenge agar unhen sunaaya jaataa he
 The Quran refers to a written pre-text, "protected tablet", which records the speech of God even before it is sent
 quran shaashvat yaa banaaya gaya mudda yah mudda nauveen shatabdi main ek dharmik bahes ban gaya
 Mu'tazilas, an Islamic school of theology based on logic and rational thought, stated that the Quran was created, while the most widespread varieties of Muslim theologians considered the Quran to be co-eternal with God and therefore unskilled
 sufi darshanik is sawaal ko kritrim yaa galat tareeke se taiyaar karte hai
 Muslims believe that the current word of the Quran is revealed to Muhammad, and according to their interpretation of Quran 15: 9, it is protected from corruption
 muslim quran ko maardarshak maanate hai, mohammad kii bhavishyavaanee or dharm kii sachai kaa sanket
 The uniqueness of the Quran is the belief that the Quran cannot be compared to any human dialect or any material
 quran ko musalamaanon dwaara ek athulaneey chamatkaar mana jaataa he, jo yom al-qiyama ke din tak prabhavi hota he, or is prakaar, mohammad ko unke bhavishyavaaniyon kii sthiti ke pramanikaran main kendriya pramaan pradaan kiya jaataa he
 The concept of indispensability arises in the Quran, where in five different verses, opponents are challenged to produce something like the Quran: "if humans and jinn are bound together to produce a voice like this Quran" So they will never be able to do this, if they can support themselves with each other and see
 " to suzav yah he ki yadi quran ke divya lekhakatv se sambandhit andeh hai, to aage aaen or aisa kuch banaaen
 From the ninth century, many people and works appeared that studied the Quran and examined its style and content
 al-jurjani or al-baqillani sahit madhyayugin muslim vidwaanon ne is vishay par kai granthon ko likhaa he, iske vibhinn pahaluon par charchaa kii he, or quran kaa adhyayan karne ke liye bhashaai drushtikon kaa upyog kiya he
 Others argue that the Quran has great ideas, internal meanings, maintaining its freshness through the ages
 or quran ke zariye vyaktigat str par or itihaas main bade badlaav hue hai
 Some scholars say that the Quran contains scientific information that agrees with modern science
 quran kii chamatkarita ke siddhant par mohammad kii nirakshartaa par jor diya gaya he kyonki agyaat bhavishyadvaktaa ko quran likhane kii kshamta kaise hogi
 That is why this is the voice of God
 quran kaa pehla sura sura e fatiha dainik prarthanaaon or anya avasaron main padhaa or doharaaya jaataa he
 This sura, which consists of seven verses, is the most frequently read sura of the Quran: shuru karata hoon khuda ke naam se jo bada meharbaan nihaayat raham vaala he; sab tarif khuda hi ke liye hai zo sabaqa rab ar maaliq he; or saare jahaann kaa paalane vaala bada meharbaan raham vaala he; roze jaza kaa maalik he; kudaaya ham teri hi ibaadat karte hai or tujh hi se madad chaahate hai; to hamako sidhi raah par sabit qadam rakhwa; unki raah jinhen tuune naimat ata kii he na unki raah jin par tera gazab dhaayaa gaya or na gumraahon kii
 " quran ko anya varg bhi dainik prarthanaaon main padhate hai
 Respect for the written text of the Quran is an important element of religious belief by many Muslims, and the Quran is treated with respect
 parampara ke aadhaar par or quran kii ek shabdic vyakhya 56:79, kuch musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki unhen quran kii ek prati chune se pehle vazu karnaa hoga, haalanki yah vichaar nahin he saarvbhaumik
 Copies of the Purani Bosida Quran are wrapped in cloth and stored indefinitely with adab in a safe place
 kabhi masjid yaa ek muslim kabristaan main dafnaaya jaataa he, yaa jala diya jaataa he or raakh ko dafan kiya jaataa he yaa pani par bikharaa hua hota he
 In Islam, most intellectual disciplines, including Islamic theology, philosophy, mysticism, and jurisprudence, are concerned with the Quran or have their foundations in their teachings
 musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki quran ke prachaar yaa padhanaa adhik praadhanyata rakhata he
 Those who preach and study it are rewarded with divine rewards

 Ismail al-faruqi and Taha Jabir Alalwani are of the view that any revival of Muslim civilization must begin with the Quran; However, the biggest obstacle on this passage is the centuries-old legacy of "tafsir and other classical disciplines that prevent the" universal, epistemological, and systematic conception "of the Quranic message

 quran kaa sandesh vibhinn saahitiyik sanrachanaon or upkarnon ke saath vyakt kiya gaya he
 In native Arabic, the surya and verses employ phonetic and thematic structures that aid the audience's efforts to recall the message of the text
 muslim jor den ki quran kii saamagree or style anuchit he
 The language of the Quran is described as "poetry prose" because it is part of both poetry and prose; However, this description runs the risk of failing to convey the rhythmic quality of the Quranic language, which is more poetic in some parts and more prose-like in others
 quran, jabaki puure quran main paaya gaya tha, pehle ke kai makka suras main vishisht he, jisamen apekshaakrit kam chand gayan ke shabdon ko pramukhataa main phenk dete hai
 The effectiveness of such a form is evident for example in Sura 81, and there is no doubt that these passages influenced the audience's conscience

 Later sections also preserve this form but the style is more expository

 Michael Bells, citing Brown's work, accepts Brown's observation that the seemingly disintegration of Quranic literary expression - its scattered or fragmented mode of sale phrase - is in fact a literary device capable of giving deep impact
 As if the intensity of the prophetic message was breaking the vehicle of human language in which it was being conveyed
 bechnaa quran kii adhik charchaa kii punrariti ko bhi sambodhit karata he, ise ek saahitiyik upkaran ke rup main bhi dekhtaa he

 stephen wild ke anusaar, quran sancharit hone vaale shabdon ko samajhane, vargeekrut karne, vyakhya karne or nyaaysangat karke is metatextility ko darshata he
 Self-referentiality is evident in those paragraphs where the Quran refers to itself as revealing itself in a self-sufficient way, as news, as a norm

 Main article: Tafsir quran ne quran ke chhandon ke arthon ko samajhane, unke aayaat ko spasht karne or unke mahatv ko jaanane ke uddeshy se tippanee or vyakhya kaa ek vishaal nikaay udaaya he
 Tafsir is one of the earliest educational activities of Muslims
 quran ke anusaar, mohammad pehla vyakti tha jisane praarambhik musalamaanon ke liye chhandon ke arthon kaa varnan kiya tha
 Other early bodies included some of Muhammad's companions, such as 'ali ibn Abi Talib,' Abdullah ibn Abbas, Abdullah ibn Umar and Ubayy ibn Kab
 un dinon main akjejesis kavita ke saahitiyik pahaluon, iske prakaashan kii prishthbhumi or kabhi-kabhi, duusare kii madad se ek kavita kii vyakhya ke spashtikaran tak hi simit tha
 If the poem was about a historical event, some traditions of Muhammad were sometimes described to illustrate its meaning
 chunki quran shastreey arabi main boli jaati he, baad main kai islam main parivartit nahin hote the, ve hameshaa kuranik arabi ko nahin samajhate the, unhone un musalamaanon ko nahin pakadaa jo musalamaanon ke arabi main dharapravaah the or ve sulajhane se chintit the quran main vishyon ke spasht sangharsh
 Commentators who commented in Arabic explained the signs, and perhaps most importantly explained that the Quranic verses were revealed in Muhammad's prophetic career, which was appropriate for the earliest Muslim community, and which was later revealed Was done, canceling or "abrogating" Nasakh) earlier text
 haalanki, anya vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki quran main koi nirasan nahin hua he
 The Ahmadiyya Muslim community has published a ten-volume Urdu commentary on the Quran, titled Tafsir e Kabir
 gudh vyakhya yaa sufi vyakhya quran ke aantarik arthon kaa anaavaran karne kaa prayaas karti he
 Sufism transcends the explicit point of the verses and instead relates Quranic verses to the inner or esoteric and spiritual dimensions of consciousness and existence
 sands ke anusaar, gudh vyakhyaayein ghoshnaatmak se adhik suchak hai, ve spashtikaran ke bajaay sanket hai
 They indicate possibilities as much as they demonstrate the insights of each author

 Muhammad Husayn Tababatei states that according to popular explanations among later passages, tawil means that a verse has been instructed
 tawal ke virodh main, prakaashan kaa arth, shabdon ke spasht arth ke anusaar spasht he, jaisaa ki unhen bataaya gaya tha
 But this explanation has become so widespread that, at present, it has become the primary meaning of tawil, which originally meant "to return" or "return place"
 tabatai ke vichaar main, jise taivil yaa quran kii harmenutic vyakhya kaha jaataa he, ko shabdon ke sanket ke saath chintit nahin he
 Rather, it deals with some truths and realities that are beyond the comprehension of the common part of men; Yet it is from these truths and realities that the doctrine of doctrine and the practical prohibition of the Quran continue
 vyakhya kavita kaa arth nahin he balki yah us arth ke madhyam se pargaman ke ek vishesh prakaar main paardarshee he
 There is a spiritual reality — which is the main purpose of obeying a law, or the basic purpose of describing a divine attribute — and then there is a real significance that a Quranic story refers to
 shiya manyataon ke anusaar, jo mohammad or imam jaise gyaan main dridhtaa se nihit hai, quran ke rahasyon ko jaanate hai
 According to Tabatai, the statement "no one knows its interpretation except God" remains valid without any adversary or qualification clause
 isliye, jahaan tak is kavita kaa sawaal he, quran kii vyakhya kaa gyaan bhagwaan ke liye arakshit he
 But Tabatabaei uses other verses and concludes that those who are purified by God know to some extent the interpretation of the Quran
 tabatai ke anusaar, sweekaarya or asweekaarya gudh vyakhyaayein hai
 Acceptable ta'wil refers to the meaning of a poem beyond its literal meaning; Rather the underlying meaning, which is ultimately known only to God and cannot be directly understood through human thought alone
 prashn main chand yahaan aane, jane, baithne, santushti, krodh or dukh ke maanviya gunon ko sanderbhit karte hai, jinhen spasht rup se bhagwaan ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya jaataa he 
 The unacceptable ta'wil is one where the apparent meaning of a poem "transfers" to a different meaning through a proof; This method is not without obvious discrepancies
 yadhyapi yah asweekaarya ta'vil ne kaaphi sweekruti praapt kii he, yah galat he or kuranik chhandon par lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The correct interpretation is that reality refers to a poem
 yah sabhi chhandon main paaya jaataa he, nirnaayak or aspasht ek jaise; yah shabd kaa arth nahin he; yah ek tathy he ki shabdon ke liye bahut shandaar he
 God has prepared them with words to bring a little to their minds; In this respect they are like stories that are used to create a picture in the mind, and thus help the listener to clearly understand the intended idea

 Written in Arabic, it combines the author's own ideas with those of his predecessors
 salaphis or jahiri ke vipareet, shiya or sufis ke saath-saath kuch anya muslim darshanikon kaa maananaa he ki quran kaa arth shabdic pahalu tak hi simit nahin he
 For him, it is an essential idea that the Quran also has internal aspects
 henry corbin ek haddees kaa varnan karata he jo mohammad waapas jaataa he: The Quran has external presence and a hidden depth, an extraordinary meaning and an esoteric meaning
 badale main yah gudh arth ek gudh arth chhupaata he 
 So this goes for seven esoteric meanings

 ek gudh slant ke saath tippaneekaron kaa maananaa he ki quran kaa antim arth keval bhagwaan ke liye janaa jaataa he
 In contrast, Quranic literalism, followed by Salafis and Zahris, is the belief that the Quran should be taken only in its explicit meaning
 punarmoolyankan kuch purv musalamaanon kii harmeniuteel style kaa naam he jo isai dharm main parivartit ho gaye hai
 His style or repetition is ad hoc and non-systematic and geared towards apologizing

 Baghdad, a 10th-century Muslim scholar from Ibn Mujahid, is famous for establishing seven acceptable recitations of the Quran
 unhone vibhinn qaraat or unki bharosemandata kaa adhyayan kiya or makka, madina, kufa, basra or damishq ke shaharon se saat 8 veen shatabdi ke qareeyon ko chunaa
 Ibn Mujahid did not explain why he chose seven readers instead of six or ten, but it may be related to a prophetic tradition that the Quran was revealed in the seven "arufs"

 Before printing was widely adopted in the 19th century, the Quran was circulated in manuscripts made by calligraphers and defendants

 The Hijaji style manuscripts nevertheless confirm that the transmission of the Quran in writing began at an early stage

 Since it would have been very expensive for most Muslims to buy a manuscript, copies of the Quran were held in mosques to make it accessible to the people

 Quranic statements on the creation of the universe and the earth, origins of human life, biology, earth science and so on have been criticized by developing theories such as foreclosure, unscientific, and scientific theories that are likely to be contradicted

 The language of the Quran was similar to the Syriac language

 quran ke avataran ke baad, or islam ke saamaanya udai, arabi varnmaala teji se ek kala rup main viksit hua
 According to Wadad Kadi, Professor of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations at the University of Chicago, and Mustassir Mir, Professor of Islamic Studies at Youngstown State University: mukhya kshetron jisamen quran ne arabi sahitya par dhyaan dene yogya prabhaav daalaa, ve dictionari or theme hai; anya kshetra quran ke saahitiyik pahaluon se vishesh rup se shapath, roopak, ruparekha or pratikon se sambandhit hai
 As far as the novel is concerned, one can say that Quranic words, idioms and expressions, especially "weighted" and formulaic phrases, appear in practically all genres of literature and in such abundance That it is impossible to compile his complete record
 quran ne na keval apane sandesh ko vyakt karne ke liye ek puri tarah se nai bhashaai corpus banaaya he, balki yah puraane arthon ke saath puraani, purv islamic shabdon ko bhi sampann karata he or yah un arthon se he jo bhashaa main or baad main sahitya main jaden lete hai 


 Allah has sent man to this earth as his caliph
 bhejne se purv usne har vyakti ko thik thik samajha diya tha ki ve thode samay ke liye dharti par ja rahe hai, uske baad unhen uske paas laut kar aana he
 Where he will get good or bad revenge for his actions which he did on earth
 Man has freedom to work on this earth
 dharti ke sadhano ko upyog karne kii chhot he
 There is no restriction or reward on doing good and bad work
 kintu is swatantraaa ke saath ishwar ne dharti par based manushyon ko thik us rup main jivan guzaarane ke liye ishwariya adeshon ke pahunchane kaa prabandh kiya or dharti ke har bhaag main usne apane doot bheje, jinhone manushyon tak ishwar kaa sandesh bheja
 The number of such messengers is said to be around 1,84,000
 is silsile kii antim kadi hazarat mohammad the
 No messenger will come after you, but Hazrat Jesus will spend the rest of his life on this earth again
 ishwar kii antim kitaab aapke haath main he koi or ishwariya kitaab ab nahin aegi
 His message was one, his mission was one, to teach human beings to live according to the divine command, for thousands of years of constant prophets, whether they had descended into any part of the earth
 hazaron varshon kaa samay bitne ke kaaran ishwariya adeshon main manushya apane vichaar, apni suvidha jod kar nayaa dharm bana lete or mul dharm ko vikrut kar ek aadambar khadaa kar dete or kai baar to ishwariya adeshon ke viparit kaary karte
 Because every effective person wanted to see everyone bow down before his power
 akhir antim nabi hazarat mohammad koran ke saath is dharti par aae or koran ishwar ke is chalange ke saath aayaa ki isaki raksha swayan ishwar karegaa
 a long time of 1500 years suggests that even after all the efforts of the Quranic opponents, not a single word of the Quran has been changed
 yah kitaab apane mul swaroop main pralay tak rahegi
 Along with this, the challenge of the Quran is still in place that those who do not consider it to be a divine book, they should show a complete book like this and not just a small part of it
 koran ke is rup ko jaanane ke baad yah jaan lijie ki yah kitaab rup main hazarat mohammad ko nahin di gai ki ise padhakar logon ko suna den or chhap kar har ghar main rakh den
 Rather, from time to time for 23 years, this book has emerged as per requirement and you have made the society on earth according to his orders at the will of God, as God had ordered

 It would be interesting to know here that Wales is not an Islam lover but anti-islam and his books have been published in opposition to Islam
 vaigyanik tathy jo ab tak hamen gyaat hai, koran main chupe hai or aise saikadon sthaan he jahaan lagata he ki manushya gyaan abhi us haqiqat tak nahin pahunchaa he
 Again and again the Quran gives you a feast to ponder
 zamin or aasmaan ke rahasyon ko jaanane kaa aamantran detaa hai
 a confusion ensues
 kuran ke daawey ke anusaar vah puri dharti ke manushyon ke liye or shesh samay ke liye he, kintu uske sambodhit us samay ke arab nazar aate hai
 It seems cursory that the Qur'an was only for the Arabs of that time, but whenever you reach a place when it seems that this thing is only for a particular time and country, then stop there
 Think or note it and consider it later, you will feel that every time a human being is one of every age and every terrain, and the same thing applies to them as the people of that time
 Used to apply to Arabs
 musalamaanon ke liye koran ke sambandh main badi badi kitaaben likhi gai hai or likhi ja sakati hai
 The purpose here is to give a brief introduction of the Qur'an and clarify what is right on its Ummah
 hazarat ali se rivaayat kii gai ek haddees he
 Hazrat Haris states that when i entered the mosque, i saw some people quarreling in some problems
 main hazarat ali ke paas gaya or unhen is baat kii soochna di
 Hazrat Ali ordered - Did these things happen? i said yes
 hazarat ali ne farmaaya- yaad rakho maine rasul allaah se suna he
 You ordered - Beware, a big head will be raised near me, i have requested - what will be the means of getting rid of this situation? The Book of Allah
 koran kaa sara nichod is ek haddees main aa jaataa he
 The last book of Allah on the Qur'an is in line with his fame
 yah atyant aasaan he or yah bahut kathin bhi he
 Easy when it is read to remember
 yadi aap kii niyat main khot nahin he or koran se hidaayat chaahate hai to allaah ne is kitaab ko aasaan bana diya he
 This is the easiest book in the world to understand and remember
 khud koran me he 'or hamane koran ko samajhane ke liye aasaan kar diya he, to koi he ki soche or samajhe?' On the other hand, from the point of view of telescopes, it is the world's hardest book, even after spending entire life it is not possible to measure its depth
 is drushti se dekha jaae to yah ek samudr he
 Houses have passed and the miracle of the Quran still prevails
 or sadiyaan biit jaaengi kintu koran kaa chamatkaar kabhi samaapt nahin hoga
 The only easy way to get instruction is to pay attention to the persistent verses and believe in the verses that this too is from Allah
 duniya nirantar pragati kar rahi he, maanav gyaan nirantar bad rahaa he, jo koran main kal mutshabihaat tha aaj vah spasht ho chukaa he, or kal uske kuch ore bhaag spasht honge
 Similarly, two different methods have to be adopted for learning
 adeshon ke lihaaz se koran main vichaar karne vaale ko peeche kii ore yatra kerani hogi
 The meaning of the Qur'an's order was seen by theologians, scholars (tabatabai, Tabai'in)
 ) or sahaba ne iskaa kya arth liya
 Even to give himself to the steps of Hazrat Muhammad, what was the order of the Quran itself? duusari ore gyanvigyaan ke lihaaz se aage or nirantar aage vichaar karnaa hoga
 Go beyond it not just with time
 manushya ke gyaan kii sataha nirantar oonchi hoti ja rahi he
 The Quran has the highest level of science, considering that new inventions, discoveries and scientific facts can be worked on
 muajaza us chamatkaar ko kehete hai jo kisi nabi yaa rasul ke haath par ho or maanav shakti se pare ho, jis par maanav budhdi hairaan ho jaae
 In the same way, there are many more
 har yug main jab bhi koi rasul ishwariya adeshon ko maanav tak pahunchataa, tab use allaah kii ore se chamatkaar die jate the
 Hazrat Musa was granted as many miracles
 hazarat isa ko murdon ko jivit karnaa, bimaaron ko thik karne kaa muajaza diya gaya
 The real opportunity of any prophet is that which he presents with a claim
 hazarat mohammad ke haath par saikadon maajaze varnit hai, kintu jo daawey ke saath pesh kiya gaya or jo aaj bhi chamatkaar ke rup main vishwa ke samaksh maujuud he, vah he koran jiskaa yah chelenz duniya ke samaksh anuttarit he ki iske ek bhaag jaisaa hi bana kar dikhaa diya jaae
 This claim was made at many places in the Quran
 The Qur'an will be completely safe, the claim has passed 1500 years and the Qur'an is safe, completely safe
 yah siddh ho chukaa he, jo ek chamatkaar he
 In the same way, there are many more
 koran vigyaan kii kasuti par khara utraa he, or uske vaigyanik varnanon ke aage vaigyanik natmastak hai
 This is also a miracle
 1500 varsh purv arab ke registan main ek anpadh vyakti ne aisi kitaab prastut kii jo beesvin sadi ke saare sadhano ke saamne apni satyata zaahir kar rahi he
 If any other book has done this work other than the Quran, the world would like to know its name
 koran kaa yah chamatkaarik rup aaj hamaare liye he or ho saktaa he aage aane vaale samay ke liye uskaa koi or chamatkaarik rup saamne aae
 When the Quran was incarnated, its main miracle in that era was not its scientific basis
 us yug main koran kaa chamatkaar tha uski bhashaa, sahitya, vagmita, jisane apane samay ke arabon ke bhashaa gyaan ko jhakzor diya tha
 It would be appropriate to clarify here that the Arabs of that time were so proud of their language knowledge that they called the people of the rest of the world Ajami
 koran kii style ke kaaran arab ke bhashaa gyaniyon ne apane ghutane tech die
 The Quran is a book based on which a revolution was brought
 registan ke aise anpadh logon ko jinka vishwa ke nakshe main us samay koi mahatv nahin tha
 Due to the teachings of the Quran, the training of his presenter brought him to the great powers of that time and a Quranic society was created in just 23 years which the world can never answer
 aaj bhi duniya maanati he ki koran or hazarat mohammad ne ek adarsh samaaj kii rachana kii
 From this point of view, if you study the Qur'an, then you have to walk with it
 uski shiksha par amal karen
 Not only in private life but in social, political and legal areas, then all those characters mentioned in the Quran will be seen alive
 ve sari kathinaayee or ve sari pareshaani saamne ajaaengi
 If the gang rises for this work with body, mind, money, then the instruction of the Quran will guide it at every turn
 koran allaah kii rassi he
 There is a hadith described by Hazrat Zaid bin Araqam in the Tirmizi which states that the Qur'an is the rope of Allah which stretches from the ground to the Assaman
 yah shabd huzur ke he jinhe hazarat zayd ne varnit kiya he
 In the same way, there are many more
 tabraani main varnit ek or haddees he jisamen kaha gaya he ki ek din huzur masjid main tasharif laae to dekha kuch log ek kone main baithe koran pard rahe hai or ek duusare ko samajha rahe hai
 Seeing this, a wave of happiness ran over your face
 aap sahaba ke us gut ke paas pahunche or un se kaha- kya tum maanate ho ki allaah ke atirikt koi anya mabood nahin he, main allaah kaa rasul hun or koran allaah kii kitaab he? sahaba ne kaha, yaa rasul allaah ham gavaahi dete hai ki allaah ke atirikt koi mabood nahin, aap allaah ke rasul hai or koran allaah kii kitaab he
 Then you said, rejoice that the Quran is the rope of Allah with one end in his hand and the other in your hand
 The Qur'an is also the rope of Allah in the sense that it binds the Muslims together
 unamem vichaaron kii ekta, mat bhinnata ke samay allaah ke adeshon se nirnay or jivan ke liye ek adarsh namoona prastut karata he
 In the same way, there are many more
 khud koran main he ki allaah kii rassi ko majbuti se pakad lo
 There is no conflict between any faction of Muslims on the basis of the Quran
 koran kaa haq koran ke har musalmaan par paanch haq hai, jo use apni shakti or samarthy ke anusaar purna karnaa chahie
 To understand the Quran, it is important to know the background of its incarnation
 yah is tarah kii kitaab nahin he ki ise puraa likh kar pigambar ko dekar kah diya gaya ho ki jaao isaki ore logon ko bulaao
 Rather, on the occasion of the Quran, which was started by Arab Muhammad in Arabia, the Qur'an was descended according to necessity
 aarambh se jaise hi koran kaa kuch bhaag avatarit hota aap use likhva dete or yah bhi bataa dete ki yah kiske saath padhaa jayega
 In order of incarnation, scholars have divided the Quran into two parts
 ek makki bhaag, doosraa madani bhaag
 Initially, there were minor appearances in maize
 unki bhashaa shreshth, prabhavi or arabon kii pasand ke anusaar shreshth saahitiyik darje vaali thi
 His words used to fall in the heart
 uske daivie sangeet se kaan usko sunne main lag jate or uske daivie prakaash se log aakarshith ho jate yaa ghabara jate
 It described the laws of creation on which human wonder is still astonishing after centuries, but all examples were local for this
 unheen ke itihaas, unhi kaa maahaul
 This went on for five years
 iske baad makke kii rajnatik tathaa aarthik satta par qabze vaale logon ne apane liye is khatre ko bhaanp kaa zulm va jyaadati kaa vah tandav kiya ki musalamaanon kii jo thodi sankhya thi usamen bhi kai logon ko gharbaar chhod kar habsha janaa padaa
 The prophet himself had to be imprisoned with all the family members in a valley and eventually left Mecca and went to Medina
 musalamaanon par yah bada sakht samay tha or allaah ne is samay jo koran nazil kiya usamen talwaar kii kaat or baadh kii tezi thi
 Which shook the entire area
 musalamaanon ke liye tasalli or is kathin samay main kii jane vaali prarthanaaain hai jo is aath varsh ke koran kaa mukhya bhaag raheen
 It is clear from this violent episode that the influence of human creativity and emotions was in the composition of this book
 makki daur ke teraa varsh baad madeene main musalamaanon ko ek kendra praapt ho gaya
 Where all the believers gathered and the incarnation of the third round began
 yahan musalamaanon kaa do nae prakaar ke logon se parichay hua
 The first Jews who had been inhabited here for centuries and according to their religious faith were waiting for the last prophet
 kintu antim nabi ko unhone apane atirikt duusari qaom main dekha to utpaat machaa diya
 During this period in the Quran, strict comments were made in the Quran on the book Ahle
 isi yug main kutachariyon kaa ek gut musalamaanon main paidaa ho gaya jo musalmaan hone kaa naatak karte or virodhiyon se mili rahat It was here that the Muslims got the permission for the armed struggle and they had to constantly face the attacks of the Meccans
 duusari ore ek islamic rajya kii sthapana ke saath puure samaaj kii rachana ke liye ishwariya niyam avatarit hue
 War, peace, justice, social customs and food, God's command of all are characteristic of the Qur'an of this era
 jinke aadhaar par samaajik barabari kaa ek adarsh rajya allaah ke rasul ne khadaa kar diya
 On the basis of this, even today, the order of Hazrat Muhammad is considered to be the first among the world heroes
 unhone jivan ke har kshaitra main zabaani nirdesh nahin die, balki us par amal karke dikhaaya
 Due to this background, the same thing has to be repeated many times in the Quran
 akeshwarwad, dharmik aadesh, swarg, narak, sabar , dharm parayanata ke vishay hai jo baar baar dohraye gaye
 The Quran was a straightforward, noble business man who was living a rich life in his family
 vishwa kii do mahaan shaktiyon ke samaksh khadaa kar diya
 Not only this, he has made the illiterate people of the desert so civilized that even after hundreds of years the pursuit of this civilization on the whole world cannot be rescued
 koran ne yudhd, shanti, rajya sanchaalan ibaadat, parivaar ke ve adarsh prastut kiye jiskaa maanav samaaj main aaj prabhaav he
 a few years ago, a group of Arabs collected verses from the Qur'an relating to the scriptures and translated them into English, Prof
 Presented to Dr
 Keith Moore, Professor of Embryology and Head of the University of Toronto
 is samay vishwa main bhrun shaastra ke sarvocch gyaata maane jate hai
 They were asked to present their views on the verses related to embryology in the Quran
 unhone unka adhyayan karne ke pashchaat kaha ki bhrun shaastra ke sambandh main koran main varnan thik aadhunik khojon ke anuroop hai
 Regarding some verses, he said that he cannot call it wrong or right because he himself is unaware of it
 isamen sabase pehle nazil kii gai koran kii vah aayat bhi shaamil thi jiskaa anuwaad he
 Take the name of your family and study, who created it
 jisane insaan ko khun kii footki se banaaya
 In this, a word has been used in Arabic language, it has one meaning of blood foot and the other means like leech
 dow
 moore ko us samay tak yah gyaat nahin tha ki kya mata ke garbh main aarambh main bhrun kii surat jonk kii tarah hoti he
 He conducted his experiments on this and after study said that initially in the mother's womb, the fetus is in the shape of leech
 dow kith moore ne bhrun shaastra ke sambandh main 80 prashnon ke uttar die jo koran or haddees main varnit hai
 In the same way, there are many more
 unhi ke shabdon main, yadi 30 varsh purv mujhase yah prashn puche jate to main inamen aadhe bhi uttar nahin de paata
 Because till then science had not made so much progress in this area
 In 1981, at the Saudi Medical Conference, Dr
 Moore announced that he had come to believe that Hazrat Muhammad was a prophet of God by looking at the verses of the Qur'an's embryology
 kyon ki sadiyon purv jab vigyaan khud bhrun avasthaa main ho itani sateek baaten keval ishwar hi kah saktaa he
 Dr
 Moore has included everything in the 1982 edition of his book which is available in many languages and is taught to first-year medical students
 is kitaab ko kisi ek vyakti dwaara chikitsa shaastra ke kshaitra main likhi kitaab kaa award bhi mil chukaa he
 There are hundreds of examples that you will read continuously in this commentary of the Quran
 mat bhinnata ek etraz kiya jaataa he ki jab koran itani sidhd kitaab he to uski tikaa main hazarat mohammad se ab tak vidwaanon main mat bhinnata kyon he
 Suffice it to say here that Prophet Muhammad promoted healthy discrimination among his followers, but you did not like bigotry and factionalism on the basis of differences
 sehatmand matbhinnata samaaj kii pragati main sadaiv sahaayak hoti he or gutbandi sadaiv nuqasaan pahunchaati he
 Therefore, the differences of Islamic scholars have also helped to work in the Qur'an hadith and in the creation of an ideal society, but the damage has been caused by factionalism by developing this differences in a radical way
 shabdic vahya koran hazarat mohammad par avatarit hua vah ishwariya shabdon main tha
 It is literal, not as meaning
 yah baat isliye spashth karnaa padi ki isai shikshan sansthaaon main yah shiksha di jaati he ki vahya ishwariya shabdon main nahin hoti balki nabi ke hriday par uskaa arth aata he jo vah apane shabdon main varnit kar detaa he
 This belief is important for Christians because they could tell the truth about the changes they made in the Bible
 puraa isai or yahudi vishwa sadiyon se yah prayaas kar rahaa he ki kisi prakaar yah sidhd kar de ki koran hazarat mohammad ke shabd hai or unki rachana he
 Many books have been written about this and efforts have been made to prove it in many ways but none have been able to achieve this success so far

 lagbhag 1 xxrep 4 0 jansankhya Road koran, quran yaa koran islam kii pavithratam kitaab he or isaki neenv he
 Muslims believe that it was narrated by Allah, the angel Jibril to Hazrat Muhammad
 musalmaan maanate hai ki koran hi allaah kii bheji antim or sarvocch kitaab he
 This book originated about 1400 years ago
 islam kii manyataon ke mutabiq koran allaah ke farishte jibril dwaara hazarat mohammad ko san 610 se san 632 main unki maut tak kulasa kiya gaya tha
 Although initially spread orally, it was first written in 633 after the death of Prophet Muhammad, and in 653 it was standardized and distributed to the Islamic Empire
 musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki ishwar dwaara bheje gaye pavitra sandeshon ke sabase aakiri sandesh koran main likhe gaye hai
 These messages originated with Adam
 hazarat aadam islamic manyataon main sabase pehla nabi tha or isaki tulana hindu dharm ke manu se ek had tak kii ja sakati he
 Just as the children of Manu have been called human in Hinduism, similarly the children of Adam in Islam are called man
 tauhid, dharmik aadesh, jananath, jahannam, sabar, dharm parayanata ke vishay aise hai jo baarambaar dohraye gaye
 In his time, the Quran was a straightforward, noble business man who was living a rich life in his family
 vishwa kii do mahaan shaktiyon ke samaksh khadaa kar diya
 Not only this, he has made the illiterate people of the desert so civilized that even after hundreds of years, the mark of this civilization on the whole world gives its mark
 koran ne yudhd, shanti, rajya sanchaalan ibaadat, parivaar ke ve adarsh prastut kiye jiskaa maanav samaaj main aaj prabhaav he
 According to Muslims, the knowledge given in the Quran proves that Hazrat Muhammad is an Islamic prophet
 "koran" shabd kaa pehla zikr khud koran main hi miltaa he jahaan iskaa arth he - usne padhaa, yaa usne uchaara
 The word takes its Syrian parallel Kuriana meaning reading texts
 hanlanki paashchaatya jaankaar isko syrian shabd se jodate hai, adhikansh musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki iskaa mul kura shabd hi he
 But whatever it was at the time of Hazrat Muhammad's birthday it became an Arabic word
 khud koran main is shabd kaa koi 70 baar zikr hua he
 Apart from this, the Qur'an also has many names
 ise al furqaan, al hikmah, dhikr / zikr or mashhaf jaise naamon se bhi sambodhit kiya gaya he
 In the Qur'an, Allah has mentioned 25 Ambiya
 quran shabd quran main lagbhag 70 baar prakat hota he, jo vibhinn arthon ko maanata he
 It is a verbal noun of the Arabic verb qara, meaning "he reads"
 siriek samatuly qarayana he, jo "shaastra padhane" yaa "sabak" ko sanderbhit karata he
 While some Western scholars consider the term to be derived from the Syriac, a majority of Muslim officials consider the word to have originated
 bhale hi, yah mohammad ke jeevankaal main arabi shabd ban gaya tha
 An important meaning of the word is "the work of the text", as indicated in the early Qur'anic passage: "it is for us to gather it and read it
 anya chhandon main, shabd "ek vyaktigat maarg " ko sanderbhit karata he
 This is done in many ways in many contexts
 udhaaharan ke taur par: "jab al-quran padhaa jaataa he, to ise sunen or chup rahen
 "can also assume the meanings described with texts from other religions such as the Torah and the Gospel
 is shabd main samanaarthi samanaarthi shabd bhi hai jo puure quran main niojit hai
 Each synonym has its own different meaning, but its use can be found with the Quran in some contexts
 is tarah ke shabdon main kitaab, aayah ; or sura shaamil hai
 The latter two terms also denote units of publication
 sandarbhon ke bade bahumat main, aamtaur par ek nishchit lekh ke saath, shabd ko "prakaashan" ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jise antaraal par "bheja gaya" diya gaya he
 Other related words are: dhikr, referring to the Quran in the sense of a reminder and warning, and hikmah, sometimes referring to revelation or part of it
 quran khud ko "samajhadaari", "grantho kii maan", "guide", "gyaan", "yaad" ke rup main varnit karata he
 And "revelation"
 ek or shabd al-kitaab he, haalanki yah anya shastron, jaise torah or bible ke liye arabi bhashaa main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The term Mushaf is often used to refer to particular Quranic scripts but is also used to identify earlier books in the Quran
 islamic parampara se sambandhit he ki mohammad ne pahaado par hira kii gupha main apni ibaadat ke dauraan apana pehla prakaashan praapt kiya tha
 Subsequently, he received the revelation of the complete Qur'an over a period of 23 years
 haddees or muslim itihaas ke mutabik, mohammad madina main aakar ek swatantra muslim samudaay kaa gathan karne ke baad, unhone apane kai saathi quran ko padhane or kanoonon ko seekhney or sikhaane kaa aadesh diya, jinhen dainik bataaya gaya tha
 It is related that some Quraysh who were taken as prisoners in the Battle of Badr regained their independence after having taught some Muslims the simple writings of the time
 is prakaar musalamaanon kaa ek samooh dhire-dhire sakshar ban gaya
 As it was said initially, the Quran was recorded on planks, skins, bones, and wooden stems
 musalamaanon ke bich zyaadaatar sure upyog main the kyonki sunni or shiya donon sroton dwaara kai hadison or itihaas main unka ullekh kiya gaya he, mohammad ke islam ke aahvaan ke rup main quran ke upyog se sambandhit, prarthana karne or padhane ke tareeke ke rup main
 However, the Quran was not present in book form in 632 at the time of Muhammad's death
 vidwaanon ke bich ek samjhauta he ki mohammad ne khud ko rahasyodghatan nahin likhaa tha
 Sahih al-bukhari narrates the revelation to Muhammad in the hadith, "sometimes it is like ringing a bell" and Aisha said, "I saw the Prophet being inspired by him on a very cold day and with his forehead
 Was sweating
 jaise hi vahi kii prerana khatm ho jaati to unki bechaini dur hojaati
 "muhammad's first revelation, according to the Quran, was with a vision
 prakaashan ke madhyam "ek shaktishaalee" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he, vah vyakti jo "sabase upar kshitij par tha jab dekhne ke liye spasht hua
 Then he came close and started talking to Muhammad
 " islamic adhyayan vidwaan velch vishwakosh main bataate hai ki unka maananaa he ki in kshanon par mohammad kii haalat or vivaranon ko vaastavik mana ja saktaa he, kyonki in rahasyodghatano ke baad unhen gambhir rup se pareshaan kiya gaya tha
 According to Welch, people around him must have witnessed these visits to the superhuman origins of Muhammad's inspirations
 haalanki, mohammad ke aalochakon ne unhen ek vyakti, ek kavi yaa jaadugar hone kaa aarope lagaaya kyonki unke anubhav pracheen arab main aise aankadon dwaara daawa kiye gaye logon ke samaan the
 Welch additionally states that it is uncertain whether these experiences occurred before or after Muhammad's initial prophetic claim
 quran mohammad ko "ummi" ke rup main varnit karata he, jise paramparaagat rup se "ashikshit" ke rup main vyakhya kiya jaataa he, lekin iskaa arth adhik jatil he
 Medieval commentators such as al-tabri stated that the word inspired two meanings: first, the inability to read or write in general; Second, inexperience or ignorance of previous books or texts
 mohammad kii nirakshartaa ko unki bhavishyavaanee kii vaastaviktaa ke sanket ke rup main liya gaya tha
 For example, according to Fakhruddin al-razi, if Muhammad had mastered writing and reading, he might have been suspected of studying the books of the ancients
 wat jaise kuch vidwaan "ummi" kaa doosraa arth pasand karte hai - ve ise pehle pavitra granthon ke saath aparichitata ko ingit karne ke liye lete hai
 The last verse of the Quran was revealed in the year 10th Hijri on the 18th of the Islamic month of Dhu al-hijjah, a date that roughly corresponds to February or March 632
 paigambar ne gadir e khumm main apana upadesh dene ke baad yah khulaasa kiya tha
 After Muhammad's death in 632, many of his companions who knew the Quran by heart were killed in the Battle of Yamama by Musalima
 pehle khalipha, abu bakr, baad main pustak ko ek granth main ikattha karne kaa faisla kiya taaki ise sangrakshit kiya ja sake
 Zaid ibn Thabit was the first to collect the Quran as he wrote the verses and suras read from Muhammad, the Prophet of Allah
 is prakaar, shastreey samooh, sabase mahatvapurn zayd bin thabit ne chand ekatra kiye or puri kitaab kaa sankalan karke kuran ko kitaab kaa rup diya tha
 In this way, the Quran came in the form of a book and it was with Abu Bakr
 is kaary ke liye zayd ne un tamaam panne jinhen haddi par, patton par, pattharon par likhaa gaya tha or kai log kanthst bhi kiye the un sab kaa krodikaran kiya
 After Abu Bakr, Muhammad's widow Hafsa Bint Umar was assigned to this manuscript in about 650
 tisare khalif uthman ebn afaan ne quran ke uccharan main maamuli matbhedon ko dhyaan main rakhana shuru kiya kyonki islam arab prayadweep se pare faras, levent or uttari africa main failaa tha
 To preserve the sanctity of the text, he ordered a committee headed by Zayd to use the copy of Abu Bakr and produce a standard copy of the Quran
 is prakaar, mohammad kii mrityu ke 20 varshon ke bheetar, quran likhit rup main patibaddh tha
 The text became the model from which copies were made and projected in urban centers of the Muslim world, and other versions are believed to have been destroyed
 quran paath kaa vartmaan rup muslim vidwaanon dwaara abu bakar dwaara sankalit mul sanskaran mana jaataa he
 According to Shia, Ali ibn Abi Talib compiled a complete version of the Quran soon after Muhammad's death
 is paath kaa kram uthman ke yug ke dauraan baad main ikattha hua tha ki is sanskaran ko kalkram kram main ekatrit kiya gaya tha
 Despite this, he made no objection against the standardized Quran and accepted the Quran into circulation
 quran kii anya vyaktigat pratiyaan ebn masood or ube ebn kaab ke kodex samet maujuud ho sakati hai, jinamein se koi bhi aaj maujuud nahin he
 The Quran is most likely written in scattered form during Muhammad's lifetime
 kai strot bataate hai ki mohammad ke jeevankaal ke dauraan badi sankhya main unke saathi ne khulaasa yaad kiya tha
 Early commentaries and Islamic historical sources support the above understanding of the early development of the Quran
 quran apane vartmaan rup main academik vidwaanon dwaara mohammad dwaara boli jane vaale shabdon ko record karne ke liye aam taur par mana jaataa he kyonki verient kii khoj ne bahut mahatv nahin diya he
 Professor Fred Donner of the University of Chicago stated that "


 there was a very early attempt to establish a uniform consonant text of the Quran, possibly a broader and more diverse set of related texts in transmission
 is manakikrut cannical paath ke nirmaan ke baad, pehle aadhikarik granthon ko dabaa diya gaya tha, or sabhi maujuuda pandulipiyon - unke kai roopon ke baavjood-is maanak vyanjan paath kii sthapana ke baad ek samay kii taarikh lagati he
 "although most version readings of the Quranic text have ceased to be broadcast, some are still
 vahaan koi mahatvapurn paath nahin hua he jis par kuranik paath kaa vidwaan punarnirmaan aadhaarit ho saktaa he
 Historically, controversy over the content of the Quran has rarely become an issue, although debate on the subject continues
 1972 main, sanaa, yaman shahar main ek masjid main, pandulipiyon kii khoj kii gai thi jo baad main us samay maujuud sabase pracheen kuranik paath sabit hue the
 Sana's manuscripts have a page from which the parchment has been washed to make it reusable — a practice that was common in ancient times due to the lack of writing materials
 haalanki, behosh dhoyaa hua antarnihit paath abhi bhi mushkil se dikhaai detaa he or ise "purv-uthamanik" kuranik saamagree mana jaataa he, jabaki sheersh par likhe gaye paath ko uthamanik samay mana jaataa he
 Studies using radiocarbon dating show that parchments date back to the period prior to 671 CE with a 99 percent probability
 2015 main, 1370 saal pehle dating karne vaale bahut hi shuruaati quran ke tukade england ke birmingham vishvavidhyalay kii pustkaalay main khoje gaye the
 According to tests conducted by the Oxford University Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, "the parchment ranged between 568 and 645, with a probability of over 95%"
 pandulipi lija arabi ke praarambhik rup hijaaji lipi main likhi gai he
 This is possibly the oldest example of the Quran, but an extended date of trials is allowed, so it cannot be said with certainty which of the current versions is the oldest
 saudi vidwaan saud al-sirhaan ne tukdon kii umr main andeh vyakt kiya he kyonki unamem dots or adhyay vibhaajak shaamil hai jinhen mana jaataa he ki baad main iskaa janm hua tha
 Muslims believe that the Quran has become a book of divine guidance from God to Muhammad through Allah through Jibril and sees the Quran as God's final revelation to humanity
 islamic or kuranik sandarbhon main prakashitvaakya kaa matlab he ki ishwar kaa kaary kisi vyakti ko sambodhit karnaa, praptakartaaon kii ek badi sankhya ke liye sandesh bhejnaa
 The process through which a divine message comes to the heart of the Messenger of God is sordid or nazul
 jaisaa ki quran kahata he, "sachai ke saath hamane ise neeche bhej diya he or sachai ke saath yah neeche aa gaya he
 " quran aksar apane paath main jor detaa he ki ise ishwariya rup se niyukt kiya jaataa he
 Some verses in the Quran indicate that even Arabic-speaking people will understand the Quran if they are recited
 quran ek likhit purv-paath, "sangrakshit tablet" ko sanderbhit karata he, jo ise bhejne se pehle bhi bhagwaan ke bhaashan ko record karata he
 The issue that the Quran is eternal or created became a religious debate in the ninth century
 tark or tarksangat vichaaron ke aadhaar par dharamshastra ke ek islamic skool mutajilas ne kaha ki quran banaaya gaya tha, jabaki muslim dharmavidon kii sabase vyapak kismein quran ko ishwar ke saath sah-shaashvat maanate the or isliye akushal the
 Sufi philosophers frame this question as artificial or incorrect
 musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki quran kaa vartmaan shabd mohammad ko pataa chalaa he, or quran 15: 9 kii unki vyakhya ke anusaar, yah bhrashtachar se sangrakshit he 
 Muslims consider the Quran a guide, a sign of Muhammad's prophecy and the truth of religion
 quran kaa anokhaapan yah vishwaas he ki quran se kisi maanviya boli yaa koi saamagree se tulana nahin ho sakati
 The Quran is considered by Muslims to be an incomparable miracle, effective until the day of Yaum al-qiyama, and thus, providing central evidence to Muhammad in the certification of his prophetic status
 quran main aprihaaryta kii avadharana utpann hoti he, jahaan paanch alag-alag chhandon main virodhiyon ko quran kii tarah kuch utpann karne ke liye chunauti di jaati he: "yadi maanav or jinn is quran kii tarah vaani paidaa karne ke liye ek saath bandha bhi jaaen to ve kabhi bhi aisa nahin kar paayenge, yadi vah aapas main kitna bhi samarthan karke dekh len
 "so the suggestion is that if there are doubts related to the divine authorship of the Quran, then come forward and create something like that
 nauveen shatabdi se, kai log or kaam dikhaai die jo quran kaa adhyayan karte the or isaki style or saamagree kii jaanch karte the
 Medieval Muslim scholars, including al-jurjani and al-baqillani, have written several texts on the subject, discussed its various aspects, and used linguistic approaches to study the Quran
 anya log tark dete hai ki quran main mahaan vichaar hai, aantarik arth hai, umr ke madhyam se apni taazgi banaae rakhte hai
 And through the Quran there have been major changes on a personal level and in history
 kuch vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki quran main vaigyanik jaankaree he jo aadhunik vigyaan se sahamat he
 The doctrine of the miraculousness of the Quran emphasizes the illiteracy of Muhammad because of how the unknown prophet would have the ability to write the Quran
 is liye yah ishwar vaani he
 The first sura of the Quran is read and repeated in Sura e Fatiha daily prayers and other occasions
 yah sura, jisamen saat chand hote hai, quran kaa sabase adhik baar padhaa jane vaala sura he: Let me start in the name of God, who is very kind to me
 All praise is for the sake of God, who is God and master; And the one who carries all the living is a great kindness; Rosé is the master of Jaza; God we pray to you and seek help from you; So, keep us on the straight path; Their path, which you have not accepted, nor their path, on which you have been thrashed and misguided
 " Other sections of the Quran are also recited in daily prayers
 quran ke likhit paath kaa sammaan kai musalamaanon dwaara dharmik vishwaas kaa ek mahatvapurn tatv he, or quran ko sammaan ke saath mana jaataa he
 56:79 Based on tradition and a literal interpretation of the Quran, some Muslims believe that they must wazoo before touching a copy of the Quran, although this idea is not universal
