 Ambedkar organized a ceremony at the Koregaon Vijay Memorial on 1 January 1927 in honor of the Indian Mahar soldiers killed during the Battle of Koregaon on 1 January 1818 under the Second anglo-maratha War
 yahan mahaar samudaay se sambandhit sainikon ke naam sangemarmar ke ek shilaalekh par khudwaye gayi tathaa koregaanv ko dalit swabhimaan kaa pratik banaaya
 By 1927, Dr
 Ambedkar decided to start a comprehensive and active movement against untouchability
 unhone saarvajanik andolanon, satyagrahon or jaluson ke dwaara, peyajal ke saarvajanik sansaadhan samaaj ke sabhi virgon ke liye khulwaane ke saath hi unhonen achhuton ko bhi hindu mandiron main pravesh karne kaa adhikaar dilaane ke liye sangharsh kiya
 He also launched a satyagraha in Mahad city to get the untouchable community the right to take water from the city's Chavdar pond
 1927 ke ant main sammelan main, ambedkar ne jati bhedbhaav or "chuaachhut" ko vaicharik rup se nyaaysangat banane ke liye, pracheen hindu paath, manusmriti, jiske kai pad, khulkar jaateey bhedbhaav va jatvaad kaa samarthan karte hai, kii saarvajanik rup se ninda kii, or unhone aupchaarik rup se pracheen paath kii pratiyaan jalaayin
 On 25 December 1927, he burnt copies of Manusmriti under the leadership of thousands of followers
 isaki smriti main prativarsh 25 disambar ko manusmriti dahan diwas ke rup main ambedakarwaadiyon or hindu daliton dwaara manaaya jaataa he
 In 1930, Ambedkar started the Kalaram Temple Satyagraha after three months of preparation
 kalaram mandir andolan main lagbhag 15,000 swayamsevak ikatthe hue, jisase nashik kii sabase badi prakriyaayein huin
 The procession was led by a military band, a batch of scouts, women and men marched in discipline, order and determination to see God for the first time
 jab ve dwaar tak pahunche, to dwaar brahman adhikariyon dwaara band kar die gaye
 By now, Bhimrao Ambedkar had become the biggest untouchable political figure till date
 unhone mukhyadhara ke mahatvapurn raajnneetik dalon kii jati vyavastha ke unmoolan ke prati unki kathith udaseenta kii katu aalochana kii
 Ambedkar also criticized the Indian National Congress and its leader Mahatma Gandhi, accusing them of presenting the untouchable community as an object of compassion
 ambedkar british shashan kii vifaltaaon se bhi asantusht the, unhone achhut samudaay ke liye ek aisi alag raajnneetik pahchaan kii vakaalat kii jisame congress or british donon kii hi koi dakhal naa ho
 Ambedkar put his political vision in front of the world during the first round table conference on 8 August 1930 in London, according to which the protection of the exploited class is in its independence from both the government and the Congress
 hamen apana rasta swayan bananaa hoga or swayan


 raajnneetik shakti shoshito kii samasyaon kaa nivaaran nahin ho sakati, unka uddhaar samaaj me unka uchit sthaan paane main nihit he
 They have to change their bad way of living 


 They must be educated 


 a great need is to shake their sense of inferiority and to instill in them the divine dissatisfaction which is the source of all heights
 ambedkar ne congress or gandhi dwaara chalaaye gayi namak satyagrah kii aalochana kii
 Due to the increasing popularity and public support among his untouchable community, he was also invited to attend the second round table conference in London in 1931
 vahaan unki achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene ke mudde par gandhi se tikhi bahes hui
 But Brido agreed with Ambedkar's ideas
 dharm or jati ke aadhaar par pruthak nirvaachika dene ke prabal virdohi gandhi ne ashanka jataai, ki achhuton ko di gayi pruthak nirvaachika, hindu samaaj ko vibhajit kar degi
 Gandhi felt that the Savarnas should be given some period of their heart-rending to forget untouchability, but this argument was proved wrong when untouchability continued to be practiced by the upper-caste Hindus even decades after the Poona Pact
 1932 main jab britishon ne ambedkar ke vichaaron ke saath sahmati vyakt karte huye achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The announcement of the Communal Award was the result of discussions at the Round Table Conference
 is samjhaute ke tahat ambedkar dwaara uthaai gai rajnatik pratinidhitiv kii maang ko maanate hue pruthak nirvaachika main dalit varg ko do voton kaa adhikaar pradaan kiya gaya
 Under this, Dalits could choose their representative by one vote and by another vote, there was freedom to choose representative of general class
 is prakaar dalit pratinidhi keval daliton kii hi vot se chunaa janaa tha
 With this provision, there was no longer any interference from the general class in choosing the Dalit representative
 lekin vahiin dalit varg apni duusari vot kaa istemaal karte hue saamaanya varg ke pratinidhi ko chunane se apni bhoomika nibhaa saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the Dalit candidate chosen by the Dalits could have kept the problems of Dalits well, but it was not necessary for the non-candidate to try to solve their problems
 gandhi is samay puna kii yeravada jail main the
 As soon as the announcement of the communal award, Gandhi first wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and demanded that it be changed
 lekin jab unako laga ki unki maang par koi amal nahin kiya ja rahaa he to unhone maran vrath rakhane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Then Ambedkar said that "if Gandhi had kept this fast for the freedom of the country, it would have been good, but he has kept this fast in protest against the Dalit people, which is very regrettable
" jabaki bhartiya isaayiyo, musalamaanon or sikhon ko mili isi adhikaar ko lekar gandhi kii ore se koi aapatti nahin ai
 "he also said that Gandhi is not an immortal person
 bharat main na jane kitne aise logon ne janm liya or chale gaye
 Ambedkar said that he cannot renounce the interests of Dalits to save Gandhi's life
 ab maran vrath ke kaaran gandhi kii tabiyat lagaataar bigad rahi thi
 Gandhi's life was in great distress
 or puraa hindu samaaj ambedkar kaa virdohi ban gaya
 Seeing the increasing pressure in the country, Ambedkar reached Yerwada jail at 5 pm on 24 September 1932
 yahaan gandhi or ambedkar ke bich samjhauta hua, jo baad main puna pact ke naam se janaa gaya
 In this agreement, Ambedkar announced to waive the right to separate electorate received by the Dalits in the Communal Award
 lekin iske saath hin communal award se mili 78 arakshit siton kii bajaay puna pact main arakshit siton kii sankhya badha kar 148 karvaa lee
 Along with this, for the untouchables, adequate amount was allocated in education grant in every province and ensured the recruitment of Dalit people without any discrimination from government jobs and in this way Ambedkar saved the life of Mahatma Gandhi
 ambedkar is samjhaute se asamaadhani the, unhone gandhi ke is anshan ko achhuton ko unke raajnneetik adhikaron se vanchit karne or unhen unki maang se peeche hatane ke liye dawaab daalane ke liye gandhi dwaara khelaa gaya ek naatak qaraar diya
 In 1942, Ambedkar rejected this agreement, 'state of Myanority' has also expressed Poona Pact's displeasure in this book

 He had three worshipers - Gyan, Swabhimaan and Sheela

 unhone prastaavit kiya ki muslim or gaiyr-muslim bahumat vaale hisson ko alag karne ke liye punjab or bengal kii prantiy simaaon ko phir se taiyaar kiya janaa chahie
 He thought that Muslims could have no objection to retaking the provincial boundaries
 agar unhone kiya, to ve kaaphi "apni maang kii prakruti ko samaj nahin paae"
 Scholar Venkat Dhalipal said that Thoughts on Pakistan "stopped Indian politics for a decade"
 isane muslim lig or bhartiya rashtriya congress ke bich samvaad ke paathyakram ko nirdhaarit kiya, jo bharat ke vibhaajan ke liye rasta tay kar rahaa tha
 Although he was a staunch critic of the divisive communal strategy of Mohammad Ali Jinnah and the Muslim League, he argued that Hindus and Muslims should be separated and Pakistan should be formed because to lead the same country, due to ethnic nationalism More violence will develop within the country
 unhone hindu or musalamaanon ke sampradayik vibhaajan ke bare main apane vichaar ke paksh me automon samrajya or checkoslovakia ke vighatan jaisi aitihaasik ghatnaon kaa ullekh kiya
 He asked whether sufficient reasons existed for the establishment of Pakistan? And suggested that differences between Hindus and Muslims might have been possible to eradicate even with a less drastic step
 unhone likhaa he ki pakistan ko apane astitv kaa auchity siddh karnaa chaiye
 Communal issues have always been there even in countries like Canada, but even today the British and French live together, so can't Hindus and Muslims also live together
 unhone chetaya ki do desh banane ke samaadhaan kaa vaastavik kriyanvayan atyant kathinaayee bharaa hoga
 With the transfer of large population, there will also be a problem of border dispute
 bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad hone vaali hinsa ko dhyaan main rakh kar kii gai yah bhavishyavaanee sahi thi
 "what Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables?" With this book, Ambedkar sharpened his attacks on both Gandhi and the Congress, accusing them of hypocrisy

 unhone bharat vibhaajan kaa to paksh liya par muslimo main vyaapt bal vivaah kii pratha or mahilaon ke saath hone vaale durvyavhaar kii ghor ninda kii
 They said, bahuvivaah or rakhel rakhane ke dushprinaam shabdon main vyakt nahin kiye ja sakate jo vishesh rup se ek muslim mahila ke dukh ke strot hai
 Take the caste system itself, everyone says that Islam should be free from slavery and caste, while slavery exists and got support from Islam and Islamic countries
 jabaki quran main nihit gulaamon ke nyaay or maanviya upachaar ke bare main paigambar dwaara kiye gaye nuskhe prashansaneey hai, islam main aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo is abhishaap ke unmoolan kaa samarthan karata ho
 Even if slavery ends, caste system will remain among the Muslims
 unhone likhaa ki muslim samaaj me to hindu samaaj se bhi kahi adhik saamaajik buraaiyaan he or musalmaan unhen " bhaichaare " jaise naram shabdon ke prayog se chhupate hai
 He also criticized the oppressive curtain practice of oppression of women in Muslim society as well as the discrimination against the Arzal classes by Muslims who were considered "lower class"
 unhone kaha haalaanki pardaa hinduon me bhi hota he par use dharmik manyata keval musalamaanon ne di he
 He criticized bigotry in Islam due to which the society has become very fanatical due to the lack of literate adherence to the laws of Islam and it is very difficult to change it
 unhone aage likhaa ki bhartiya musalmaan apane samaaj kaa sudhaar karne main vifal rahe hai jabaki iske vipareet turki jaise deshon ne apane aapako bahut badal liya he
 Both Hindu and Muslim groups suffering from "communalism" have ignored the demand for social justice
 10-12 saal hindu dharm ke antargat rahete hue babasahab ambedkar ne hindu dharm tathaa hindu samaaj ko sudhaarney, samta tathaa sammaan praapt karne ke liye tamaam praytn kiye, parantu savarna hinduon kaa hryday parivartan na hua
 On the contrary, he was condemned and even called the destroyer of Hindu religion
 useke baad unhone kaha tha kii, “hamane hindu samaaj main samanta kaa str praapt karne ke liye har tarah ke praytn or satyagrah kiye, parantu sab nirarthak siddh hue
 There is no place for equality in Hindu society
 ” hindu samaaj kaa yah kahana tha ki “manushya dharm ke liye hai” jabaki ambedkar kaa maananaa tha ki "dharm manushya ke liye hai
 "ambedkar said that such a religion has no meaning in which humanity has no value whatsoever
 jo apane hi dharm ke anuyaayion ko dharm shiksha praapt nahin karne detaa, naukari karne main baadha pahunchaata he, baat-baat par apamaanit karata he or yahan tak ki pani tak nahin milane detaa aise dharm main rahane kaa koi matlab nahin
 Ambedkar did not declare any renunciation of Hinduism for any kind of enmity and destruction of Hinduism, but he decided it with some fundamental principles which were not in sync with Hinduism
 13 oktober 1935 ko nasik ke nikat yevala main ek sammelan main bolte hue ambedkar ne dharm parivartan karne kii ghoshnaa kii, "although i am born as an untouchable Hindu, i will not die as a Hindu at all!" unhone apane anuyaayiyon se bhi hindu dharm chhod koi or dharm apnaane kaa aahvaan kiya
 He also reiterated this in several public meetings across India
 is dharm-parivartan kii ghoshnaa ke baad hyderabad ke islam dharm ke nizaam se lekar kai isai mishnariyon ne unhen karodon rupee kaa pralobhan bhi diya par unhonen sabhi ko thukraa diya
 Of course, he also wanted that the economic condition of the Dalit society should improve, but not by being dependent on the money, but by their hard work and organization
 iske alaava ambedkar aise dharm ko chunanaa chaahate the jiskaa kendra manushya or naitikta ho, usamen swatantraaa, samta tathaa bandhutav ho
 In any case, he did not want to adopt a religion which is riddled with apartheid and untouchability, nor did he want to choose a religion which has superstition and hypocrisy
 ambedkar ne dharm parivartan kii ghoshnaa karne ke baad 21 varsh tak ke samay ke bich unhone ne vishwa ke sabhi pramukh dharmon kaa gahan adhyayan kiya
 The main reason for his taking such a long time was that he wanted more and more followers to convert with him at the time he converted
 ambedkar buddha dharm ko pasand karte the kyonki usamen teen siddhanton kaa samanvit rup miltaa he jo kisi anya dharm main nahin miltaa
 Buddhism teaches wisdom, compassion and equity

 God and soul cannot save society
 ambedkar ke anusaar sachcha dharm wo hi he jiskaa kendra manushya tathaa naitikta ho, vigyaan athwa bauddhik tatv par aadhaarit ho, na ki dharm kaa kendra ishwar, aatma kii mukti or moksh
 At the same time, he said that the work of religion should be to rebuild the world and not to explain its origin and end
 vah janatantric samaaj vyavastha ke pakshdhar the, kyonki unka maananaa tha aisi sthiti main dharm maanav jivan kaa maardarshak ban saktaa he
 He got all these things in the only Buddhism

 But the Indian government should have only limited powers and the Indian people should not have any rights in Kashmir

 After all, what are we doing for this freedom? We are getting this freedom to improve our social system, which is full of inequality, discrimination and other things that conflict with our fundamental rights

 drav kaach ko thanda karne par usamen shyanta badhati he or dhire-dhire bina kaachiya gunon kaa saadhaaran thos kaach ban jaataa he
 Several types of raw materials are liquefied at different temperatures, mixing in different quantities, as used to make the kach
 dravit kaach ko siliketon tathaa boreton kaa parsparik vilyan kaha ja saktaa he
 According to the temperature in this solution, many components are released into the oxides
 vilyan main ve atirikt oxide bhi hote hai, jo rasinic yogikon ke nirmaan kii aavashkataaon se adhik maatra main hote hai
 Kach can also be called a 'superheated' fluid, because kach changes gradually from the liquid state to the solid state, and the solid Kach has all the physical properties of its liquefaction, such as heat conductivity, etc
 kaach nirmaan ke liye mukhya padaarth silica he or yah prakruti main mukt avasthaa evam silicket yogicon ke rup main paaya jaataa he
 In nature silica is mostly found in the form of quartz

5-0
25 millimetre ke vyas ke hon
 The sand is also washed by water to produce good mud
 elahabaad main shankargarh or vargarh ke baaluu ke nikshep kaach nirmaan ke liye ati uttam hai or uttar pradesh sarkaar ne vahaan par baaluu dhone ke kuch yantra bhi laga die hai
 It is also very important to have some alkaline substances such as soda ash for making simple sachets
 is mishran se dravanank kam or dravan kriya saral ho jaati he
 The water that is formed by the dissolution of these two substances is known as water tank, because it is water soluble
 kaach ko sthaayee banane ke liye koi dwisamakshareey oxide jaise calcium oxide yaa sis oxide ko bhi milaanaa padataa he
 According to the chemical law, the more substances added, the lower the liquid content
 prayek padaarth kaach main kuch vishesh gun utpann karata he or in gunon ko hi dhyaan main rakhte hue kaach ke mishran banaae jate hai
 Cassium oxide provides chemical stability to the sachets, but in excess, the sludge has a tendency to grow

 Lime or limestone is added to the kach mixture for calcium oxide
 boric amla yaa suhaaga se kaach main vishesh bhautik gun utpann ho jate hai, jaise nune prasar-gunank or adhik tanaav sahansheeltaa, tapiya sahan shakti evam adhik jal-pratirohakata
 Due to these properties, in the manufacture of accidental heat conversion items such as thermometer hose, lantern chimney and cooking utensils, the maximum amount of boric oxide and the amount of alkali are kept to a minimum
 sodium corbonate ke sthaan main anya kshar jaise potacium carbenet kaa bhi upyog vishesh kaachon main kiya jaataa he
 Often alkali is used as sulfate salts
 sis oxide ke liye adhiktar laal sis kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 This oxide increases both the density and spacing of the sachets, and for this reason, such sludge is used in the manufacture of optical greens, hygienic and drinking vessels and artificial gems
 sisayukt kaach sheeghra hi kaate or paalish kiye ja sakate hai
 Potash alkali leaded sachets are the most luminous
 aluminium oxide, adhiktar felspar dwaara kaach main sammilit kiya jaataa he
 This oxide increases heat spread, hardness, durability, elasticity, tensile strength, luster and acid resistivity in the sludge
 iske dwaara kaach main samaangta or vaigyanik kaaryon main upyogi anya gunon kii vruddhi hoti he
 This reduces the diffusion coefficient of the oxide glass and the softening temperature
 yah vikachan ko roktaa he or iske prayog se kaach kaa dravan or shodh saral ho jaataa he
 Zinc oxide is often added to the slurry by zinc carbonate
 yah padaarth kaach ke prasar gunank ko bahut kam karata he
 It is used in the manufacture of chemical slabs because of its high stability in the slurry and less heat generated diffusion
 kuch kaachon main magnesium yaa barium oxide bhi sammilit kiya jaataa he
 Some substances are added to the kach for the purpose of producing special chemical properties
 sis yukt kaachon main kuch oxykaarak padaarth, jese potacium nitrate yaa shora kaa hona aavashyak hota he
 Many small bubbles of gas, which are called 'seeds', get trapped in the gas when it is liquefied
 kaach ko inase mukt karne ke liye kuch rasinic padaarthon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 These substances become gases in the liquid slurry and bring the seeds out of the slice with them
 in padaarthon ko 'shodhak dravya' kehete hai
 Generally, carbon ammonium salt or arsenic is used for purification
 aalu, chukundar or bhigi lakdi ke tukade dravit kaach main daalkar bhi kahin-kahin kaach kaa shodhan kiya jaataa he
 Kach is used in many types of commodities that require different physical properties
 kaach ke bhautik gunon main bhinnata vibhinn oxidon dwaara laai ja sakati he
 The physical properties also depend on the relative quantity of each oxide present in the pot
 ghanatv- kaach main sabase adhik ghanatv sis oxide dwaara aata he or sabase kam boric oxide dwaara
 Electrical properties- The electrochemicality of a kach is dependent on its composition, temperature and atmosphere
 aajkal kaach kaa upyog achaalak ke liye bhi kiya ja rahaa he
 Thermal properties - The heat is transmitted when heated, but there is minimal diffusion of boric oxide and magnesium oxide and maximum expansion from alkaline oxide
 ushma chaalakata- kaach ushma kaa adham chaalak he; silica tathaa boric oxide se kaach main ushma-chaalakata kam hoti he
 Other physical properties of the sachets, such as Young's coagulation coefficient, stress strength, firmness and thermal tolerance, depend on the oxides contained in the sachets
 kaach main inke prabhaav kaa vaigyanik adhyayan karke rasinic kaach, ushmapratirohak kaach, jo laal tapt kar ekadam barf main thande kiye ja sakate hai or tapamapi kaach kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he

 tapiya sahansheeltaa- achaanak taap parivartan kii us maatra ko, jise kaach bina toote sahan kar sake, kaach kii tapiya sahansheeltaa kehete hai
 To test this property, the items of the kachha are heated to various temperatures in water and suddenly dipped in ice cold water
 pashcharikaran, bhojan banane ke bartan, lamp kii chimaniyaan, rasinic kaach or tapamapi kii nalee ke liye, ucch tapiya sahansheeltaavale kaach kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In order to produce greater thermal tolerance in the sachets, the amount of silica must be higher and the amount of alkali should be reduced and the sachets should also contain some amount of zinc oxide, boron oxide and aluminum oxide
 prakaashiya gun- lenson main prakaashiya gun, jaise ucch vartanaank evam vikshepan bhi, kaach main bhinn oxidon kii matraaon par nirbhar hai or isliye sis oxide, barium oxide or calcium kii matraaon ko ghataakar badhaakar prayek bhanti ke vishesh vartanaank or vikshepan ke bahumoolya kaach taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai
 For the transduction of ultraviolet light, the glaze of transdermide is made of mastic silica, as these springs cannot penetrate through ordinary mercury; But they can easily go beyond liquid quartz
 shyanta- kaach nirmaan main shyanta bhi ek aavashyak gun he, kyonki kaach kaa dhaman, peden, karshan or belanaa, bahut kuch kaach kii shyanta par hi nirbhar rahete hai; abhitaapan main vikruti ko hataanaa bhi shyanta se hi sidhaa sambandhit he
 The viscosity of the sachets depends on the oxide content of the sachets
 silica kii maatra badhaane se kaach kaa shyanta-paraas bad jaataa he; chooney kii vruddhi se shyanta badhati he, parantu shyanta-paraas kam hota he
 Viscosity decreases with increasing soda content, but viscosity increases
 jab kaach kii vastu ko garam kiya jaataa he to baahar kii sataha bheetar ke bhaagon ke apeksha adhik garam ho jaati he or isi prakaar jab tapt dravit kaach ko thanda karke thos kiya jaataa he tab thos hote samay kaach ke baahar kii sataha bheetar kii apeksha adhik thandi ho jaati he
 Due to the difference in temperature, there is uneven diffusion or shrinkage in the slag, which causes stress within it and corresponding distortions in the slag
 nirmaan ke samay kaach tapt rahata he, isliye thanda hone par kaach kii vastuon main pratibal or vikrutiyaan aa jaati hai
 The process of removing them is called the elimination of kach
 is vidhi main kaach kii vastuon ko phir se kaach ko komal honevaale taap se kuch kam taap par ek samaan tapt kar diya jaataa he
 This frees the kach from distortions due to change in viscosity
 tab kaach ko bahut dhire-dhire thanda kiya jaataa he
 This convergence-range also depends on the oxide content of the glass
 adhik ksharyukt kaach paryaapt nimna taap par abhithapit kiye ja sakate hai
 For complex sludge, such as chemical sludge heat resistant sachets, the absorbency heat is very high
 prakaashiya kaachon ke abhitaapan main bahut adhik sam lagata he; kyonki unako bahut dhire-dhire thanda karnaa hota he jinamein ve praaia: vikrutiheen hon
 It took more than a year to cool the kachha of the world's largest 200 inch diameter telescope
 jin kaach paatro main aushadhi, bhojan yaa peya rakhaa jaataa he, unke kaachon par bahut samay tak dravon kii rasinic kriyahone kii sambhaavna rahati he
 All chemical particles have to suffer corrosion of water, acid and alkali
 dwarwale evam prakaashiya kaachon ko rituksharan sahanaa padataa he
 Therefore, it is necessary that these muds have such properties that the aforesaid corrosion has minimal effect on them

As a result, the farmers were no longer the owners of the land, they were now renters dependent on the mercy of the landowner! 3 The methods of recovery were inhuman! 4 Zamindari buying and selling mortgages had become the object of partition! 5 Zamindars had come to the city from the village to work in their place which were completely greedy and exploited the peasants to the maximum! 6 The income of the farmer used to go towards repaying the land revenue and the debt started falling on his head, poverty increased in the villages, agricultural production also fell because there was no motivating reason for the farmer that the produce would have been of the landlord so that he could Did not even do farming! 2 Raiyatwadi system was the second settlement implemented by the British Raj, it was implemented in 1820 in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Deccan! Within this, the farmers were directly contacted, these farmers were the owners of their land, but in this settlement, the rate of land revenue was very high, 48-52%, when it was 55%, the recovery was very ruthless! Farmers who could not pay taxes were put in jail, which they also had to bear themselves, as a result of this, due to high land revenue, the price of land in these areas was greatly reduced! 2 Most of the production used to go to pay taxes! 3 Farmers used to take loans from moneylender so that they could pay the tax, which once came in this trap, they could not get out, so here too, the landowners became landlords! 4 Both the collector and the moneylender were exploited together! 5 The biggest increase in rural debt was in these areas! 3 Mahalwadi system - The last settlement implemented by the British government which was implemented in 1822 was the symptom of this! 1 The governance of the entire village was determined! The pioneer family of 2 villages were made Mahaldars, they used to determine the tax of every farmer and collect the tax collected by the government and the tax was fixed on a personal level even though it was a matter of fact! The result 1 Mahaldar had become an intermediary class who were also leaders and were getting the most out of it! 3 Rural society began to disintegrate! The results of the geopolitical system were all arranged in the spirit of maximum exploitation, but the government did not want to have any concern with agriculture and farmers! 2 This led to the formation of the middle class, all these were exploiting the farmers, but there was no way to protect them! Be the reason for it! 4 Due to very high rates, the farmers had nothing to live for, they went on getting poorer, they were burdened with debt! 5 The state of agriculture deteriorated, the farmers were depressed on its side, the middle class was uninterested, the government was mean to recover! Curzon went to establish the agriculture department in 1899 after a continuous famine! In fact, the British The government had no agricultural policy adhik se adhik bhumi ko vyapaarik fasalo jute, kapaas, ganna, opium, nil, chaay, kaafii ke adheen laana tha, in fasalon kii kheti jameendaar, british bagan maalik, sahuukaar, tathaa madhyast varg kisaanon se jabaran karwaata tha in fasalon kii keemat kisaan ko bazaar bhav se naa de kar ve apni marji kaa prayog karte the in fasalon kii kheti naa karne par kisaanon ko kathor yaatnaao kaa saamana karnaa hota tha !sabase karaab haalat nil ke kisaanon kii thi unke dwaara 1859-1860 kaa prasiddh nil vidroh bhi kiya gaya tha

 Dutt, 'british rule made India a country of recurrent famines, famines that had never been in the history of India or the world' 1 Due to the famines, famine was considered a natural disaster
 There were no human able to deal with them! 2 In fact, the reasons were different
 Curzon himself believed that 'famines were not the wrath of God because many famines had come without drying up' even though the famines were poor a number of social economic reasons were responsible for Ta and Recurring such as available food stock, transport facilities, increase in prices, lack of work programs for food, very poor purchasing capacity of the public! 3 RC Dutt had high geopolitics Was considered to be the cause of famine! 4 The famine of famine was that the grain was cheap, and it was also exported, but millions of people did not have the money to buy it
 No reduction, but died due to lack of purchasing power! 5 Black marketing, hoarding, and complete lack of public distribution system also increased the magnitude of famine! 6 Administrative reasons were also responsible; The government had no means to know the population distribution, cultivated area, quantity of food grains, the condition of fertilizers in different areas, food behavior of people, general economic system of the people! 7 Famine Commissions also gave erroneous reports
 The Lyell Commission said, "famine is the only unemployment-related problem of the peasantry!" 8 Britishers: Due to the land revenue settlement, agricultural production was continuously falling, especially after the land which produced food grains first
 i started producing crops like jute, jute, which could not be found and their price was not even met! Amari was it was also the Jnkshti and increased! 2 Due to these, the population could not get bus again for many years and normal activities could not be done
 3 Due to heavy manpower, wealth, lack of animal-seeds, it used to take many years for the salvation of agriculture, during which there were constant deaths due to incest, thus these relationships were wound! 4 Animals had high mortality rate of human beings, due to famine, low life expectancy, excessive labor force also had consequences due to famine! Had an insulting PL 480 plan 1 bharat ke sadiyo puraane hast udhog ko nasht kiya gaya jo rojgaar kaa bada saadhan tha or hamaari saanskrithik viraasat kaa bhaag tha !2 bharat ko odhogik kranti ke falo se praytanpurn dhang se vanchit rakhaa gaya tha tathaa yah aadhunik udhog lagane naa dena ye prakriya pratham vishwa yuddh tak chalati rahi !dengul tharner jinhone is saklpana kaa aalochnatam vishleshan kiya he ke parinamo kaa varnan karte hua kaha he 1 british sarkaar ne sab kuch sochi samajhi chaal se kiya taaki britain main odhogik kranti safal ho sake is hetu hi bharat ko mukt vyapaar kaa sabase bada kshetra banaaya gaya is prakriya ne bharat se dhan nikasi ko tej kar diya !2 bharat kii paaramparik aatmanirbharta samaapt ho gai! 3 kaaryshil shram bal khaskar udhigo me kam ho gaya! 4 nirmaan udyong main bhi rojgaar kii kami aa gai !5 bhartiya hast tathaa kutir udyong nasht ho gaye nagar ujaad gaye pashchim me odhogik kranti hone pe karigar nae kaamo me lag gaye kintu bharat me unako kisaan bananaa padaa kyonki yaha nae udhog viksit hue hi nahin the !6 bharat kaa bazaar british maal se bhar gaya tha wo sirf kachche maal kaa niryaat karata tha! 7 vishwayuddh kaal me bharat ko dikkat kaa saamana karnaa padaa kyonki videsh se maal kii aporati band ho gai thi ! The meaning of drain of money - Before the establishment of the British Raj, India was the world's largest industrial producer, its main exports were spices, indigo, sugar, silk cloth, medicine, precious stones, handicrafts, and cotton textiles
 The balance was more in favor of India, the countries were full of gold and silver deposits

 Dutt and others also worked in this field! His main concept was the poverty of India, soon after Dada Bhai's citation, 'poverty and Un British Rule in India', was published in which he said that he received from India
 1 / 4 of the revenue goes out of the country to Britain and then it only increases the resources of the British! 'it is the constant flow of money that is sucking the life blood of India' Naoroji considered this exploitation as the root of all evil and the main cause of India's poverty, after which Ranade also published his views about it! Best work r

 Dutt had done his book, the economic history of India had created panic! All these creations worked to tell the people of India about their poverty
 These ideas came to know that the reason for the country's poverty is that much of the country's gross domestic product goes to Britain, instead of which the country gets no benefit
 Mill is the principle of withdrawal of wealth! It was not associated with any limited concept, it did not mean only the export of money and goods! According to Dutt, the tax and expenditure incurred by the people remains between them and only develops them but when the money gets out of the country
 If it does not benefit the country from that then, according to Dutt, the withdrawal of funds has created a shortage of capital in India, which has stopped the development of the country, according to them, money from the revenue also has been released
 The Asi Jisse farmer gets poor! Dutt severely criticized that British rule in India is like a continuous loot and attack which is Timur, Nadirshah, It is worse than the attack of Abdali and any charmer
 They have come and looted, but the British Raj is being looted every day, due to which India has become a country of famines and famines which are often more horrific and any comparison of them or India Cannot be done in world history! Along with economic awakening, Sidhant had also done political awakening
 It has told the people of India the true intention of British Raj and told them that Rakrati and what the consequences can be !, This gave rise to the demand for self-government, its appeal also affected the middle class to the intellectual class! Sources of money withdrawal - RC Dutt analyzing the nature of money withdrawal Talked about the ways in which the money is passed from the country
 Direct sources - The money sent to England, salary, gratuity, which was given to civil, civil workers in Britain
 The establishment of the ST India Company and later the expenses of the Office of the Secretary of India! 3 Dividend to the shareholders of the company which was 10
5% of the revenue of India! 4 The biggest direct route was home charge, purchase of military equipment for India, expenditure on India office, military expenditure, especially spread of colonialism from India's fund
 Such as India Afghan War, Boer War, World War! Indirect Exit 1 The biggest route was trade, from India money was sent to Britain to purchase goods here! In this way India did not get anything in return for its goods
 With the commercialization of agriculture, the extraction of raw materials started

 The "business plan" under the title is called the plot
 "kathanak" or "katha" donon hi shabd sanskrit "cath" dhaatu se utpann hai
 In Sanskrit literature, the word "katha" has been used in the sense of a certain poetic form, but the common meaning of the word Katha is "that which is said"
 yahan kahanevaale ke saath-saath sunanevaale kii upasthiti bhi antarbhukt he kayonki "kahana' shabd tabhi sarthak hota he jab use sunanevaala bhi koi ho
 In the absence of a listener one can only imagine "speaking" or "murmuring", not "saying"
 iske saath hi, vah sabhi kuch "jo kaha jaae' katha kii parisimaaon main nahin simat paata
 Hence, narrative refers to the saying or narration of an "alleged event" that has a definite sequence and outcome
 i
em
 farster ne "ghatnaon ke kalanukramik varnan' ko katha kii sangya di he; jaise, naashte ke baad madhyahn kaa bhojan, somvaar ke baad mangalvaar, yauvan ke baad vriddhavastha aadi
 Conversely, there is an element of the plot that is consistent with the chronological chain of events described in it and assists them, and all the events of the story around which grow and develop like a weft
 katha yaa kahani bhi saadhaarant: kaaryavyapaar kii yojana hi hoti he, parantu kisi ek bhi katha ko kathanak nahin kaha ja saktaa; kaaran, katha kii vishistataa keval uske kalanukramik varnan ko abhibhoot kar leti he
 "the protagonist fell in love with the heroine and eventually she was chosen
 '-katha he
 "the hero saw the heroine, he became enamored with her
 praptimarg ke anek avarodhon ko apane shaury or lagan se dur karke, ant main, usne nayika se vivaah kar liya
 '- is the plot
 arthath katha kisi bhi kathatmak saahitiyik kriti kaa dhaanchaa maatr hoti he jabaki kathanak main tatprastut prakaranwastu ke anuroop katha kaa swaroop spasht, sangat evam buddhigrahya banakar ubharta he
 According to Webster, the definition of plot is as follows- uparyukt vivechan se is mahatvapurn tathy kaa udghaatan hota he ki katha ko sunate yaa padhate samay shrota athwa pathak ke man main aage aanevaali ghatnaon ko jaanane kii jigyaasa rahati he arthath vah baar-baar yahi poochta yaa sochataa he ki phir kya hua, jabaki kathanak main vah ye prashn bhi uthaata he ki "aisa kyon hua?' "yah kaise hua?' aadi
 That is, along with the curiosity to know the events that occur next, the listener or reader is also conscious of the work-cause-relationship between the events
 katha guhamanav kii jigyaasa ko shant kar sakati he kintu buddhipravan vyakti kii tripti kathanak ke madhyam se hi sambhav he
 Therefore, it can be said that the movement of time in the plot opens the event and at the same time its occurrence is based on the rational work-cause-interrelationship, in accordance with the rational composition of the world
 isiilie usamen aarambh, madhya or ant, teenon hi sunishchit rahata he
 These three steps can be clearly seen in the beginning story of "adam Eve"; as, prohibition, violation and punishment
 kathanak kala kaa saadhan he, at: bhavottejnaa laane ke liye usamen jivan kii pratyayjanak yarthatata ke saath aakasmikta kaa tatv bhi aavashyak he
 That is why the events of the plot are not aligned to the exact events of the real events, but are aligned according to the self-created legislation
 kathanak dev daanav, atipraakrit or aprakrit ghatnaon se bhi nirmit hote hai kintu unka ukt nirmaan parampara dwaara sweekrut vidhaan tathaa abhipraayon ke anusaar hi hota he
 Therefore, despite being unreliable they are reliable
 kathanak kii gatisheel ghatnaayen sidhi rekha main nahin chalatin
 They have ups and downs, fate changes, circumstances make a man from something 1 He often has to contend with his companions or against external powers, ie his situation
 kathanak main jivan ke isi gatiman sangharkshil rup kii jeevant avatarana kii jaati he

 The active substance in Dhana Patikka is lead peroxide
 rin pattica ke sakriy padaarth ye hai : sarrandhra, sookshm vibhajit, swat:baddh dhatvik shuddh lead tathaa alpayojya padaarth, jiskaa kaary sanrandhrata ko banaae rakhana he
 During the lifetime of the battery, the minus plate is repeatedly charged and immersed, thus the additives are required to maintain the stability of the debt plate
 prayavarti dhan tathaa rin patticoon ke madhya main pruthakkaarak lagaakar, in donon patticoon ko pruthak kar samyojit karte hai
 The separator prevents money and loan bars from touching each other
 pruthakkaarak ko amlapratirodhi tathaa vidyut apghaty evam vidyutdhara ke liye saralata se pargamya hona chahie
 This permeability should be fine-grained so that particles of active substances do not enter during the operation of the battery from the money plates
 pruthakkaarak kaa rin pattica ke baad kaa bhaag samtal hota he or dhan pattica ke vipareet ore kaa bhaag khaanchedaar yaa dharidaar hota he
 Generally wood is used more as a separator

 jalwaayu yaa parivartansheel aavesh dar sambandhi ucch taap kaa saamana karne ke liye kritrim pruthakkaarak kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The separator is introduced by a supporting sheet of a porous material, such as glass filaments or perforated rubber
 yah prachlan dhan pattica ke parshv ke vipareet rakhaa jaataa he
 When the battery is overworked, this reinforcement is helpful in the control of the lid of the active material during its lifetime
 lead amla bydaree main vidyut apghaty praaia: tanu salphurik amla, jo bydaree ke aavesh kii avasthaa ke saath saath parivartit hota he, rahata he

 is samay vidyut apghaty, arthath salphurik amla, kaa aapekshik ghanatv kam ho jaataa he, kyonki kuch salphurik amla pani main parivartit ho jaataa he
 The battery is charged with the current flowing opposite to the direction in which the current is moving while the battery is in action, due to which the battery recovers its original condition, that is, lead sulphate of the fillet is in the precursor of the lead oxide
 goes
 is prakaar rin pattica par hydrogen aayan do electron mukt karata he
 Its reaction is as follows: dhan pattica par sulphate aayan do alectron mukt karata he, jisaki abhikriya nimnlikhit he : Since plumbic sulfate is not stable in water, the final reaction is as follows: aavesh kii abhikriya se vidyut apghaty kaa aapekshik ghanatv bad jaataa he
 The cycle of charge and immersion lasts until the physical structure of the battery is destroyed due to electrical decomposition or oxidation of the separator

 syadawaad jain darshan ke antargat kisi vastu ke gun ko samajhane, samajhane or abhivyakt karne kaa saapekshik siddhant he
 According to Jainism, any thing has eternal qualities
 mukt yaa kaivalya praapt sadhak ko hi anant gunon kaa gyaan sambhav he
 Knowledge of ordinary humans is partial and relative
 vastu kaa yah aanshik gyaan hi jain darshan main nay kehalaata he
 There are different approaches to understanding any object
 ye nay satya ke aanshik rup kahe jate hai
 With partial and relative knowledge only the attainment of relative truth is possible, not the attainment of absolute truth
 saapeksh satya kii prapti ke kaaran hi kisi bhi vastu ke sambandh main saadhaaran vyakti kaa nirnay sabhi drushtiyon se satya nahin ho saktaa
 The reason for differences between people is that they start to consider their views as very true and ignore the views of others
 vichaaron ko taarkik rup se abhivyakt karne or gyaan kii saapekshata kaa mahatv darshane ke liye hi jain darshan ne syadawaad yaa saptabhangi nay kaa siddhant pratipaadit kiya he
 In order to make sense of relative knowledge, the use of Syatvada has been instructed at the beginning of every new in Jain philosophy
 yahan dhyaan rakhana chahie ki 'syat' kaa arth 'shaayad' nahin he
 Jains exemplify this through an elephant and six blind persons
 sabhi netraheen gyaan kii uplabdhta or us tak pahunch kii seemaa kaa bodh karaate hai
 If one tells an elephant on the basis of limited experience that an elephant is told like a pole, rope, wall, python or fan, then it only expresses its partial knowledge and relative truth
 yadi isi anubhav main 'syat' shabd jod diya jaay to mat dosharahit mana jaataa he
 That is, if it is said - 'symbol elephant is like a pole or rope', then the vote would be considered logically correct
 saapekshik gyaan kii taarkikta ke aadhaar par jain darshan main nirnay yaa mat ke saat prakaar maane gayi hai
 This classification of empirical judgment or opinion by Jain philosophy is called Saptabhangi Nay
 yah pehla mat he
 For example, if it is said that 'the elephant is like a pillar', it would mean that in a particular country, time and situation, the elephant is like a pillar
 yah mat bhavatmak he
 This is the right thing
 isame koi shaq nahi he
 This is a negative opinion
 is pariprekshya main hathi ke sambandh main mat is prakaar hona chahie ki- syat hathi is kamare ke bheetar nahin he
 This does not mean that there are no elephants in the room
 syat shabd is tathy kaa bodh karaata he ki vishesh rup, rang, aakaar or prakaar kaa hathi is kamare ke bheetar nahin he
 In the realization of which the elephant is like a wall or rope, this new form is used as a negative opinion
 syat shabd se us hathi kaa bodh hota he jo mat diye jane ke samay kamare main upasthit nahin he
 This view means that the power of the object may or may not be from a particular point of view
 hathi ke udhaaharan ko dhyaan main rakhen to vah khambhe ke samaan ho bhi sakati he or nahin bhi ho sakati he
 In such circumstances only 'siyat hai and not Siyaat' can be used
 yadi kisi mat main paraspar virdohi gunon ke sambandh main ek saath vichaar karnaa ho to us vishay main syat avaktavyam kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 With respect to the elephant, it can sometimes happen that it cannot be said with certainty whether it is like a pillar or a rope
 aisi sthiti main hi syat avaktavyam kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 There are some questions about which it is appropriate to remain silent, or to say that nothing definite can be said about it
 jain darshan kaa yah chauthaa paraamarsh is baat kaa pramaan he ki ve virodh ko ek dosha ke rup main sweekaar karte hai
 An object or event can happen at the same time and yet it is possible that nothing can be said about it
 kisi vishesh drushtikon se hathi ko rassi jaisaa kaha ja saktaa he
 But if there is no clear indication of sight then it becomes impossible to describe the nature of the elephant
 atah hathi rassi jaisi or avarnaneey he
 This consultation of Jains comes from the addition of the first and fourth nayas
 kisi vishesh drushtikon se sambhav he ki kisi bhi vastu yaa ghatana ke sambandh main 'nahin he' kah sakate hai, kintu drushti spasht na hone par kuch bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Hence elephant is not like rope and is indescribable
 yah paraamarsh duusare or chauthe nay ko mila dene se praapt ho jaataa he
 According to this view, the elephant is like a rope from one point of view, it is not from the other point of view and when the vision is unclear then it is also indescribable
 yah paraamarsh tisare or chauthe nay ko milakar banaaya gaya he
 17,000 lava yaa lova dakshinpurvi asia main basane vaala ek samudaay he jo mukhya rup se uttari thailand main rahata he
