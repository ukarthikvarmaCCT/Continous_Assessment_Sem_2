 The fauna of the forest house is responsible for 75% of the total gross primary product of the system and 80% of the earth's vegetation is found in the forests
 Forests at different heights form different ecosystems
 Such as the boreal forest near the poles, tropical forest near the equator and temperate forest at moderate heights
 The height of an area and the moisture present there affect the trees found in that area
 Humans and forests have both positive and negative effects on each other
 Forests provide resources to humans and also provide sources of earning
 Forests also affect the health of humans
 While there is a negative impact on the forest due to human intervention

 Shringar Ras Pradhanbharatendu ji has beautifully portrayed both the coincidence and disconnection aspects of Shringar

 vahiin, angreji kaa varchasv bhi badhata ja rahaa tha
 Brajbhasha was dominated in literature
 farsi ke prabhaav vaali urdu bhi chalan main aa gai thi
 At such a time, Bhartendu developed a standing dialect based on Urdu free from the lingua franca and Persian
 aaj jo hindi ham likhte-bolte hai, vah bhaaratendu kii hi dein he
 That is why he is considered the father of modern Hindi
 keval bhashaa hi nahin, sahitya main unhone naveen aadhunik chetana kaa samavesh kiya or sahitya ko 'jan' se joda
 There is duplicity in Bharatendu's composition
 kavita jahaan ve braj bhashaa main likhte rahe, vahiin unhone baaki vidhaon main safal haath khadi boli main aajamaaya
 In the true sense, Bharatendu is the master of modern standing dialect prose
 bharatendu ji ke kavy kii bhashaa pradhantah braj bhashaa he
 He adopted the modified form of the Braj language, leaving out the obsolete words
 unki bhashaa main jahaan-tahaan urdu or angrezi ke prachlit shabd bhi jate hai
 The language of his prose is simple and practical
 muhaavaron kaa prayog kushaltapurvak hua he
 Bharatendu ji's poetry shows the following genres - 1
 reeti kaaleen raspurn alankaar style - shringarik kavitaaon main, 2
 Emotional style - in terms of devotion, 3
 vyangyatmak style - samaaj-sudhaar kii rachanaaon main, 4
 Proclamation style - in poems of patriotism
 bhaaratendu ji ne lagbhag sabhi rason main kavita kii he
 Shringar and Shanta are the predominance of juices
 shringaar ke donon pakshon kaa bhaaratendu ji ne sundar varnan kiya he
 There is also an excellent scheme of humor in his poetry
 bhaaratendu ji ne apane samay main prachlit praayah sabhi chhandon ko apanaaya he
 He has given verses in Urdu, Sanskrit, Bangla language not only in Hindi
 unke kavy main sanskrit ke basant tilka, shardool, vikreedit, shalini aadi hindi ke chaupai, chappay, rola, soratha, kundaliyaan kavitt, savaiya ghanaachari aadi, bangala ke payaar tathaa urdu ke rekhta, ghazal chhandon kaa prayog hua he

 Bharatendu ji appeared in Hindi with the message of Nav Jagran
 unhone hindi ke sarvangin vikaas main mahatvapurn kaary kiya

 aadhunik hindi ke ve janmdata maane jate hai
 The plays of Hindi were also originated by him
 bhaaratendu ji apane samay ke saahitiyik netaa the
 Many talented writers were born to them
 matra-bhashaa kii seva main unhone apana jivan hi nahin sampurna dhan bhi arpit kar diya
 His main theme was the advancement of Hindi language
 1882 main shiksha ayog ke samaksh apni gavaahi main hindi ko nyaayalayon kii bhashaa banane kii mahatta par unhone kaha- In this context, in 1868, he wrote a satirical poem from 'urdu Ka Sipa' Naam- apni inhen kaaryon ke kaaran bharatendu hindi saahityakaash ke ek daidipyaman nakshatra ban gaye or unka yug bharatendu yug ke naam se prasiddh hua
 Publications such as Harishchandra Chandrika, Kavikavasudha, Harishchandra Magazine, Stree Bala Bodhini reveal his thoughtful and progressive editorial approach
 bharatendu kaa sabase mahatvapurn kaary yah he ki unhone hindi sahitya ko, or uske saath samaaj ko samrajya-virdohi disha main badhane kii prerana di
 In 1870, when he wrote an article titled 'levi Pran Levi', aiming at Lord Mayo, in Kavibhasudha, a new anti-imperial consciousness began to spread in Hindi literature
 6 july 1874 ko kavivachansudha main likhaa ki jis prakaar america upniveshit hokar swatantra hua usee prakaar bharat bhi swatantrata laabh kar saktaa he
 He established a Tadiya society whose members pledged to treat indigenous goods and boycott foreign goods
 bharatendu ne vilayati kapadon ke bahishkaar kii apil karte hue swadeshi kaa jo pratigya patr 23 march, 1874 ke 'kavivachansudha' main prakashit kiya, vah samooche hindi samaaj kaa pratigya patr ban gaya
 Bharatendu said in that, sabase pehle bharatendu harishchandra ne hi sahitya main jan bhaawanaaon or aakankshaon ko swar diya tha
 For the first time, Bhartendu incorporated 'jan' in literature
 unke pehle kavy main reetikalin pravritiyon kaa hi bolbalaa tha
 Literature had become the fountainhead of the decadent feudal culture, but Bharatendu made literature a means of portraying and opposing the poverty, subjugation, inhuman exploitation of foreign rulers
 apane naatakon, kavitt, mukariyon or prahasanon ke madhyam se unhone angreji raaj par kataaksh or prahaar kiye, jiske chalate unhen angrejon kaa kopbhaajan bhi bananaa padaa
 Bharatendu understood the exploitation system of the British very well
 apni patrika kavivachansudha main unhone likhaa tha – Not only this, Bhartendu understood this form of exploitation long before Dadabhai Naoroji introduced the theory of Drain of Wealth in the beginning of 20th century
 unhone likhaa tha – The British carry India's wealth with them and this is the root cause of the poverty and sufferings of the people of the country, this truth was understood by Bharatendu
 kavivachansudha main unhone janata kaa aahvaan kiya tha – Bharatendu's global consciousness was also very intense
 unhen acchhee tarah pataa tha ki vishwa ke koun se desh kaise or kitni unnati kar rahe hai
 Therefore, he gave a very pithy speech at the Dadri fair in Ballia in 1884 on 'how can Bharatvarshanoti be there'
 yah lekh unki atyant pragatisheel soch kaa parichaayak bhi he
 In this, he called upon people to abandon evil practices and superstitions and get good education, develop industries, emphasize cooperation and unity and be self-reliant in all fields
 dadri jaise dharmik or lok meley ke saahitiyik manch se bhaaratendu kaa yah udbodhan agar dekha jaae to aadhunik bhartiya saamaajik, raajnneetik or aarthik chintan kaa prasthaanbindu he
 See a small part of the speech- vichaaron kii spashtataa or use vinodpriyata ke saath kis tarah prastut kiya ja saktaa he, iskaa yah nibandh bejod udhaaharan he
 See, how Bharatendu expresses India's concern in this essay, vastav main unka yah lekh bharat durdasha naamak unke naatak kaa ek tarah se vaicharik vistaar he
 In India's predicament, he says, bharatendu acchhee tarah samaj chuke the ki 'angreji shashan bharatiyon ke laabh ke liye he' yah purnatah khokhla daawa tha or dushprachaar tha
 Bharatendu gave an indication of how the British were looting the wealth of India, in his commentary in the March 7, 1874 issue of 'kavikavasudha', bharatendu stri-purush kii samanta ke itane bade pairokaar the ki 'kavivachansudha' ke 3 november, 1873 ke ank main unhone likhaa, 1473 is an ordinary year of Gregory calendar

 'bajirao mastaani' ek bhartiya aitihaasik romance film he jiskaa nirdesan or nirmaan sanjay lila bhansaali ne kiya he
 The film tells about Peshwa Bajirao of the Maratha Empire and his second wife Mastani
 ranvir singh or deepika padukon ne ye donon mukhya kirdaar nibhaae hai, priyanka chopra ne bajirao kii pehali patni kaa va tanvi aazmi ne bajirao kii maan kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa he
 Bajirao Mastani is released on 18 December 2015
 bajirao mastaani film kii shuruyaat nae peshwa banane se shuru hoti he iske liye bajirao ko chunaa jaataa he iske baad is khushi main sabhi samrajya ke log khushi manaate hai
 Then suddenly Mastani from Bundelkhand comes to the aid and after fighting Bajirao's soldiers directly meets Bajirao and convinces him to take him to Bundelkhand where he fights with both the rivals and conquers there
 iske baad bajirao bundelkhand main holi manaate he isi bich bajirao or mastaani main pyaar ho jaataa he
 On the second day, Bajirao goes back to Pune
 isi bich jate vaqt bajirao mastaani ko apni kataar de ke jate hai is kaaran bundelkhand main kataar se vivaah ho jaataa he is parampara ke tahat mastaani pune jaati he
 There she meets Radhabai, Bajirao's mother
 radhabai mastaani ko nahin chaahati he is kaaran wo nafrat karne lagati he
 After this, Chimaji Appa shows Shaniwarwada and also shows amazing Ainamahal
 mastaani jab radhabai se rishte ko maanane liye kahati he to wo ghunghru dekar kahati he ki ab se tumhaara rishta ho gaya he ab se tum mehafil main naachogi
 Then Chhatrapati Sahu is invited from Satara, then Bajirao goes there, then Radhabai goes a new trick and sends Mastani by giving it to Gungroo but Mastani reaches there and puts Ghungroo in front of Gungru Chhatrapati Sahu, due to this, the Pant representative considered insult to the Mahfil
 But when Chhatrapati Sahu comes to know that she is the daughter of King Chhatrasal, he bites her to go back and says that you Or should he Mastani speaks that i should Baji is in love with Baji
 iske pashchaat mastaani bajirao kii pratiksha karti he us vaqt tufaan aa jaataa he or bajirao vahaan aakar mastaani se vivaah kar detaa he
 Meanwhile, Kashibai also comes to know and she also gets angry
 phir kashibai or mastaani ke putr hote he or unka namakaran kiya jaataa he
 Kashibai's son is named Raghunath while Mastani's son is named Samasher Bahadur
 isi bich bajirao or chimaji appa ke bich ladaai ho jaati he
 Bajirao tells everyone that he will bring Mastani to Shaniwarwada on Saptami day, but Krishnabhata and Radhabai tell them not to do it
 yah film suprasiddh marathi upanyaaskaar nagnath inaamdaar ke utkrisht aitihaasik upanyaas rau par aadhaarit he
 This novel is one of the successful historical novels not only in Marathi but also in the entire Indian languages
 isamen itihaas evam itihaas-ras donon kii raksha karte hue utkrisht sarjanaatmakataa kaa parichay diya gaya he
 There is naturally a lot of drama in this novel and while reading, it seems as if someone is watching a good serial
 iske varnanaatmak drishy bhi chalchitr ke drishyon kii tarah maanas-patal par ankit rah jate hai
 Being based on such a novel, a number of features have naturally come into the film
 sanjay lila bhansaali jaise siddhhast nirdeshak ke dwaara yah kahani or bhi chamak uthi he
 It is natural for the film to make some difference from the text, as the mediums of the two are different, but in this film some differences have been deliberately introduced in the form of film shots and shakes, which has shocked the perception of history
 aarambhik drishyon main bajirao ko peshwa niyukt karne vaala drishy to bahut hi uttam evam upyukt bhi he, or upanyaas se baahar kaa hote hue bhi aitihaasikta evam itihaas-bodh ke sarvatha anuroop he; parantu jis drishy main kashibai kii puraani saheli aati he, jiskaa pati peshwa bajirao ke kaaran maaraa gaya he or isliye vah apane pati kii raakh vahaan chhod kar ek tarah se shaap detii he, vahaan spasht antar aa gaya he
 In the novel, Kashibai has a dignified presence as a skilled housewife, while in the film, Kashibai is seen leaping towards a playful teenager, unraveling history
 filmkaar yah bhi bhul gaya he ki jis kashibai kaa vah aisa filmakan kar rahaa he uskaa betaa jawan ho rahaa he or vahi us utsav kaa mukhya karta-dharta tha
 Here, instead of Kashibai Peshwa's wife, the film heroine seems to be 'priyanka Chopra'
 chhatrasaal kii sahaayta ke liye bajirao ko mastaani ke dwaara sena sahit le janaa bhi bilkul anaitihaasik rup vaala ho gaya he
 Very interesting to see, but neither did it, nor could it happen by Mastani
 is prakaar ke chote-mote drishyon ko chhod bhi den tab bhi do akshamya bhoolen filmkaar ne kii hai-- shrimant bajirao peshwa or kashibai donon ko alag alag samay main nachvaa daalaa he
 In that era and in the Peshwa family, a woman like Kashibai, who was in a way a queen, would not have needed to keep dancers exclusively if she danced
 usamen bhi khaas baat yah he ki jis samay film main kashibai ko mastaani ke saath nachaaya gaya he, un dinon uske pair main baraabar rahane vaala dard or bhi badha hua tha
 Kashibai's meeting with Mastani has also turned out to be a different way and the film is shaky
 atah aitihaasikta ke saath rachanaatmak anand ke liye to ukt upanyaas hi padhanaa hoga, parantu mahan bajirao peshwa evam mastaani kii apurv premgautha evam durdharsh jivan ko maharashtra se baahar bhi jan-jan tak pahunchaane kaa kaary is film ne prabal rup se kiya he, iske liye filmkaar avashya dhanyavad ke paatr hai
 The acting of almost all the actors is also lively and admirable, which motivates the film to watch again and again
 varsh 2003 main sanjay lila bhansaali ne is film ke mukhya kirdaar ke liye salmaan khan or aishwarya raay ko chunaa tha
 Who was also in the lead role in his film Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam
 par baad main unhen un donon ke bich hue matbhed ke kaaran badalanaa padaa
 After this, in July 2003, he selected Kareena Kapoor and Rani Mukerji to play Bajirao's wife
 bhansaali ji ne coffee vid karan main yah bataaya kii ve salmaan khan or karina kapur ko isliye nahin le paae kyonki ve pehle hi kisi anya film main kaary kar rahe the
 It was also rumored among some that Shah Rukh Khan will play this role in place of Ajay Devgan
 iske alaava isamen ruthik roshan or deepika padukon ranvir singh or katrina caff ke rahane kii sambhaavna thi
 In July 2014, Bhansali verified that Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone were chosen as the lead characters in the project

 To solve this problem, they had to imagine that matter emits and absorbs light-energy in indivisible units
 yah ikai kwantum kehalaati he
 Another failure of orthodox physics occurred when interpreting the photoelectric effect
 is prabhaav main prakaash ke kaaran dhaatuon se electranon kaa utsarjan hota he
 To explain this, Einstein resorted to Planck's imagination and proposed that light energy is transmitted in the form of granules
 in kanikaon ko photon kaha jaataa he
 If the frequency of the light wave is v, then the energy of the photon associated with it is e = hν
 h ko plank sthiraank kehete hai In 1905, Einstein proposed a very revolutionary theory called special relativity

 Zeeman showed the spectrum of atoms flowing through the magnetic field
 is prakaar parmaanu kii vidyunmay rachana kii pratishtha hui
 The indivisibility of the atom came to an end and the sight of scientists reached within it
 1911-13 i0 main radarford ne alpha kanon ke prakirnan dwaara yah siddh kiya ki parmaanu ke bheetar sabhi dhan aavesh centre se 10-12 senmi0 duuri ke bheetar ekatrit rahete hai

 He conceived a wave associated with each mass and proved that the wavelength of this wave is equal to the ratio of the Planck constant and the particle's momentum, which was confirmed by Davison and Warmer, etc
 shredinger ne 1926 i0 main is vichaar ko sudrudh ganitiya aadhaar pradaan kiya
 Its principle is called wave mechanics

 According to modern physics the rules are not deterministic, they only express possibilities
 is sambandh main higenverkh ne anischitata kaa siddhant pratipaadit kiya he
 According to this theory, both the momentum and the situation cannot be measured exactly simultaneously
 yadi kisi ek samay main ek ko yatharth parishuddhta se mapa jaay, to duusari raashi ekadam anishchit hogi
 The product of the uncertainties quantities of both quantities will be at least equal to the Planck constant

 prayog karne par gyaat hry ki ye kirane teen prakaar kii hoti hai, jinhen alpha, beta or gamma kiran kaha jaataa he
 Reducing the temperature and pressure of a radioactive element by changing its other physical state, by making chemical combinations with another element, or by applying magnetic fields, etc
 does not affect the intensity of the radioactivity of the element
 isse yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki radioactivata newclius kaa gun he or iskaa electron vinyas se koi sambandh nahin he
 Neutrons were discovered in 1932, which are heavier than protons and an undesired parent particle
 ab yah mana jaataa he ki newclius ke bheetar neutron tathaa protron dono hote hai
 The ratio of neutrons and protons in light elements is half and the number of neutrons in the nucleus of heavier elements is more than the number of protons

 This is called beta radioactivity
 nutrino ek anaveshit evam electron se bhi kaaphi halkaa mul kan he, jo bahut samay tak vaigyanikon ke prekshan se bachaa rahaa
 It was first detected in 1953 AD
 newclius kii uttejit avasthaa main jab parivartan hota he, to gamma kirane nikalati hai, jo ekskiran ke samaan par unase adhik urjavali, vidyucchumbakeey tarangen hai
 Scientists created instruments to increase the energy of charged particles, which are called accelerators
 adhik urja vaale in kanon kii sahaayta se newcleey abhikriyaaon kaa or mul kanon kii utpatti evam unke gundharmo kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he

 The uncontrolled chain reaction of fission of uranium used to make atomic bombs led to the detection of a nuclear nuclei reaction after 1950, which produced even greater amounts of energy
 is abhikriya main halake newcleiason kaa ek baari newclius main sanlayan kiya jaataa he
 Scientists speculate that this reaction is the source of energy of the Sun and other stars

 The name of Green Revolution was also given because, as a result, Indian agriculture had risen above the subsistence level to a higher level
 uplabdhiyaan The Green Revolution resulted in significant progress in the agricultural sector of the country
 krishi aagton main hue gunatmak sudhaar ke falswaroop desh main krishi utpaadan badha he
 Self-sufficiency has come in food grains
 vyavsaayik krishi ko badhaava mila he
 The attitude of farmers has changed
 krishi aadhiky main vruddhi hui he
 As a result of the Green Revolution, there has been a substantial increase in the production and total productivity per hectare against crops like wheat, sugarcane, maize and millet
 harith kranti kii uplabdhiyon ko krishi main takniki evam sansthagat parivartan evam utpaadan main hue sudhaar ke rup main nimnavat dekha ja saktaa he- krishi main takniki evam sansthagat sudharracinic urvarkon kaa prayog As a result of the new agricultural policy, the amount of consumption of chemical fertilizers has increased rapidly

 Presently, eco-friendly worm control program has been implemented under Integrated Agriculture Management
 bahufasali kaarykram The purpose of the multi-crop program is to increase production by growing more than one crop in a year on the same land
 anya shabdon main bhoomi kii urvartaa shakti ko nasht kiye bina, bhoomi ke ek ikai kshetra se adhiktam utpaadan praapt karnaa hi bahufasali kaarykram kehalaata he

 iske atirikt desh main 527 krishi vigyaan kendra hai, jo shikshan evam prashikshan kaa kaary kar rahe hai
 To maintain the quality of agricultural education and training, computerization and internet facilities of various institutions have been provided
 krishi utpaadan main sudharutpaadan tathaa utpaadakta main vruddhi The biggest advantage of the Green Revolution or the new development method implemented in Indian agriculture was that the area of crops in the country increased, agricultural production and productivity increased
 visheshkar gehun, bajra, dhan, makka tathaa jowar ke utpaadan main aashaatheet vruddhi hui
 As a result, India became self-sufficient in food grains
 1951-1952 main desh main khadyannon kaa kul utpaadan 5
09 karod ton tha, jo kramshah badhkar 2008-2009 main badhkar 23
38 karod ton ho gaya
 Similarly there has been a substantial improvement in productivity per hectare
 varsh 1950-1951 main khadyannon kaa utpaadan 522 kigra prati hectares tha, jo badhkar 2008-2009 main 1,893 kigra prati hectares ho gaya
 Yes, there has also been some exaggeration in food grains production in India due to bad weather etc
 which proves that agricultural production in the country still depends on the weather
 krishi ke paramparaagat swaroop main parivartan As a result of the Green Revolution, the traditional form of farming has changed and farming has started to be done commercially
 jabaki pehle sirf pet bharne ke liye kii jaati thi
 There has been an increase in the production of sugarcane, cotton, jute and oilseeds in the country
 kapaas kaa utpaadan 1960-1961 main 5
6 million ganth tha, jo badhkar 2008-2009 main 27 million ganth ho gaya
 Similarly, the production of oilseeds was 7 million tonnes in 1960–1961, which increased to 28
2 million tonnes in 2008–2009
 isi tarah patson, ganna, aalu tathaa moongfalee aadi vyavsaayik fasalon ke utpaadan main bhi vruddhi hui he
 At present, cultivation of horticultural crops, fruits, vegetables and flowers is also being encouraged in the country
 krishi bachaton main vruddhi Production has increased through the use of improved seeds, chemical fertilizers, good irrigation and machines
 jisase krishakon ke paas bachaton kii ullekhneey maatra main vruddhi hui he
 Which can be used in the development work of the country
 agragami tathaa pratigaami sambandhon main majbootee New technology and modernization of agriculture have made the relationship between agriculture and industry stronger
 parmparik rup main yadhyapi krishi or udyog kaa agragami sambandh pehle se hi pragadh tha, kyonki krishi kshetra dwaara udyogon ko anek aagat uplabdh karaaye jate hai
 But the regressive relationship between these two was very weak, because the manufactured goods of the industry were rarely used in agriculture
 parantu krishi ke aadhunikaran ke falswaroop ab krishi main udyog nirmit aagton, jaise- krishi yantra evam rasinic urvarak aadi, kii maang main baari vruddhi hui he, jisase krishi kaa pratigaami sambandh bhi sudrudh hua he
 In other words, the relationship between agriculture and industrial sector has become stronger
 is tarah spasht he ki harith kranti ke falswaroop desh main krishi aagton evam utpaadan main paryaapt sudhaar hua he
 As a result, farmers, government and public have become convinced that India can not only become self-sufficient in the field of agricultural produce, but can also export
 vishleshan There has been substantial development in the field of agriculture in the planning period in the country
 kul krishi kshetra badha he, fasal ke swaroop main parivartan hua he, sinchit kshetra badha he, rasinic khaadon ke upyog main vruddhi hui he tathaa aadhunik krishi yantron kaa upyog hone laga he
 Despite all these things, the development of agriculture in the country has not yet reached the proper level, because the agricultural production per hectare is less than other developed countries
 abhi anek krishi utpaadon kaa aayaat karnaa padhata he
 Because their production is less than the demand
 krishi kshetra kaa abhi bhi ek badha bhaag acinchit he
 The level of mechanization in agriculture is still low, leading to higher production costs
 krishakon ko vibhageeya suvidhaayen paryaapt maatra main nahin milti hai, jisase krishi vikaas main baadha utpann hoti he
 Therefore, there is a need for further development of the agricultural sector by implementing technical and institutional reforms in agriculture more effectively
 harith kranti kaa vistaar In the first component of the action plan made for the development of the agriculture sector in the Union Budget 2010-2011, with the active cooperation of Gram Sabhas and farmer families, the expansion of Green Revolution in the eastern region of the country Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Eastern Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Orissa
 a provision of Rs 400 crore has been made for this
 kamiyaan tathaa samasyaayen As a result of the Green Revolution in the country, there has been a substantial increase in the production of some crops, there has been a decrease in the import of food grains, there has been a change in the traditional form of agriculture, yet some shortcomings are reflected in this program
 harith kranti kii pramukh kamiyon evam samansyaon ko nimna rup main pranstut kiya ja saktaa he- Impact - The impact of the Green Revolution was limited to certain crops, such as wheat, jowar, millet
 anya fasalo par iskaa koi prabhaav nahin padaa he
 Even rice has been affected very little by this
 vyapaarik fasalen bhi isse aprabhavit hi hai
 Promotion of capitalist agriculture - Seeds of more fertile variety are a capital-intensive program, in which large amounts have to be invested on inputs such as fertilizers, irrigation, agricultural implements etc
 baari nivesh karnaa chote tathaa madhyam shrenee ke kisaanon kii kshamta se baahar hai
 In this way, those farmers who have private pumping sets, tractors, tube wells and other agricultural machines are benefiting from the Green Revolution
 yah suvidha desh ke bade kisaanon ko hi uplabdh he
 Ordinary farmers are deprived of these facilities
 sansthagat sudhaaron kii aavashyaktaa par bal nahin - nai vikaas vidhi main sansthagat sudhaaron kii aavashyaktaa kii sarvatha avhelnaa kii gayi he
 Under institutional changes, the most important component is the system of land holding
 isaki sahaayta se hi takneekee parivartan dwaara adhiktam utpaadan praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Land reform programs have not been successful in the country and even today, certainty of landholding has not been provided to millions of farmers
 shram-visthaapan kii samasya - harith kranti ke antargat prayukt krishi yantrikaran ke falswaroop shram-visthaapan ko badhaava mila he
 It is also a reason for the rural population to migrate to cities in search of employment
 aay kii badhati asamanta - krishi main takneekee parivartanon kaa gramin kshetron main aay-vitaran par vipareet prabhaav padaa he

 According to V
 Rao, "it is now well known that inequality in rural income has increased with the so-called Green Revolution, which has helped to increase the production of food grains in the country, many small farmers have to give up their tenancy rights and Social and economic tensions have increased in rural areas
 " Lack of necessary facilities - Due to lack of facilities necessary for the success of Green Revolution, such as irrigation system, agricultural credit, economic holdings and cheap inputs etc
, the desired success in the field of agricultural development is not being achieved
 kshetreey asantulan - harith kranti kaa prabhaav punjab, haryana, uttar pradesh, maharashtra tathaa tamilnadu aadi rajyon tak hi simit he
 Due to its effect not spreading on the whole country, the country could not develop in a balanced manner
 is tarah, harith kranti simit rup se hi safal rahi he
 Tips for the success of Green Revolution sansthagat parivartanon ko protsaahan - harith kranti kii safalataa ke liye bhoomi sudhaar kaaryakramon ko prabhavi or vistrut rup se lagu kiya janaa chahie
 Shareholders should be given the right of ownership
 seemaa nirdhaaran se praapt atirikt bhoomi ko bhoomihin krishakon main vitarit kiya janaa chahie
 The division of holdings should be effectively stopped by making consolidation effective
 krishi vitt kii suvidha - krishi vitt kii suvidhaayen badhaate samay chote kisaanon ko riyayati dar par saakh kii suvidha uplabdh karaayi jaani chahie, taaki ve aavashyak unnat beej, rasinic khaad tathaa krishi upkaran kray kar saken
 Increase in employment opportunities - Labor intensive techniques should be adopted and cottage and village industries should be expanded rapidly to solve the problem of unemployment in rural areas
 sinchai ke sadhano kaa vikaas - desh main sinchai kii suvidhaon kaa paryaapt vikaas kiya janaa chahie, taaki krishak adhik upaj dene vaali kismon kaa puraa laabh uthaa saken
 In this context, attention should be paid to the expansion of minor irrigation projects
 anya sanrachanaatmak sudhaaron kaa vistaar - krishi ke vikaas ke liye aavashyak bijli, parivahan sahit anya sanrachanaatmak suvidhaon kaa vikaas kiya janaa chahie
 Only then will the Green Revolution spread to other crops and regions
 harith kranti kaa anya fasalon tak failaav - harith kranti kii safalataa ke liye yah aavashyak he ki iskaa vistaar chaaval tathaa anya fasalon kii kheti tak kiya jaye
 Production growth in respect of commercial crops like pulses, cotton, sugarcane, oilseeds, jute, etc
 has also not been satisfactory with rice
 atah in fasalon ko bhi harith kranti ke prabhaav kshetra main shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 Connecting small farms and small farmers - Small farms and small farmers should also be associated with green revolution
 iske liye aavashyak he ki- bhoomi sudhaar kaaryakramon ko shighrata or prabhavi dhang se lagu kiya janaa chahie, chote-chote kisaanon ko unnat beej, khaad aadi aavashyak chizon ko kareedne ke liye udaar sharton evam daron par saakh suvidhaayen uplabdh karaayi jaani chahie, saadhaaran krishi upkarnon kii kareed ke sambandh main di gayi suvidhaon ke atirikt badi-badi farm mashinari yatha-tractor, harvester aadi ko sarkaar kii ore se kiraye par diya janaa chahie, bahut choti-choti joton vaale kisaanon ko sahakaari kheti ko apnaane ke liye prerit kiya janaa chahie
 Integrated Farm Policy - For the success of the Green Revolution, a coordinated farm policy should be adopted, so that a proper policy can be adopted in relation to the value of farm technology and inputs, and farmers should be encouraged to cultivate seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and agricultural machinery and equipment at a reasonable price
 Be available on time

 brahmi lipi evam usase vyutpann adhikansh lipiyon kii varnmaala ke prayek varg ke paanchaven varnon ke samooh ko panchamakshar yaa panchamakshar kehete hai 
 Devanagari has 7, J, N, n and m stamps
 vibhinn bhashaaon main panchamaaksharon kaa prayog hota he
 All languages have their own rules or conventions for using Panchamaksharas
 hindi main takneekee tankan yantron kii samasyaon se nikaalane ke liye taatkaalik rup se panchamaaksharon ke ardhswaroop ke sthaan par anuswaar kaa upyog karke kaam chalaa lene kaa upaay sujhaayaa gaya tha jiske falswaroop samasamyik hindi lekhan main panchamakshar ke sthaan par anuswaar ko variyata di jane lagi he
 Generally, the xxwrep 4 n, and m of the fifth varna - 'kavarga', 'chvarga', 'tavarg', 'tavarg' and 'heaven' are used to explain the phonetics of anusvara
 jaise- ganga- ganga, pancham - pancham, kanth - kanth, kandha - kandhaa, kampan- kampan aadi
 As far as Hindi is concerned, in order to facilitate the use of Devanagari on typing machines, in some situations it was suggested to write a reminder in place of Panchamakshar
 kintu aisa nahin he ki panchamaaksharon kaa prayog varjit kiya gaya tha, yaa panchamaaksharon ke sthaan par anuswaar kaa prayog adhik shuddh ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 In some situations, some suggestions related to the use of Anusvara in place of Panchamakshars were given for Subhita
 varnmaala ke vibhinn virgon ke pariprekshya main inke prayog main parivartan sambhav he
 like- kavarg main ji kaa prayog k, kha, ga, gha ke purv hota he
 However, in some words like 'paramukh' and 'vaamay', only the use of 'om' is found
 yahan kaa prayog nahin kiya ja saktaa
 ङ The consonant does not come at the beginning and end of the word
 iske anusaar vishisht dhvanyatmak prayogon ko chhodkar is varg ke liye anuswaar kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 In class, j is used before Ch, Ch, H, J
 jaise- anchal, panchhi, anjan evam jhanjhat aadi
 Although j is not used in Hindi writing often
 inke sthaan par ab anuswaar kaa hi prayog ho rahaa he
 j also does not come at the beginning or end of the word
 tavarg main n kaa prayog t, tha, da, dha ke purv hota he
 Like- Hour, gorge, egg etc
 ab inke sthaan par praayah anuswaar kaa prayog hota he
 Nāna is used only in Sanskrit words independently
 vah bhi madhya or ant main
 In addition to class, credit also comes before interest, and credit, but in such a situation, a reminder does not come in its place
 jaise- punya, kanv evam vishann
 n is used in the tavarga before t, t, d, d
 jaise- jantar, manther, tandoor, gandh aadi
 Now it is recommended to use Anusvara instead of them
 jaise- ant, panth, anand evam gandhak
 In class, m is used before P, F, B, B
 jaise- sampark, gumphit, ambar, gambheer aadi
 Now, instead of N, J, n and N, the reminder is often used in their place
 jaise- sampark, gunfit, ambar evam gambhir
 Kishori Das Vajpayee, who authored the Hindi word translation, believes that the Panchamaksharas are resonant hypnosis
 unke anusaar hindi ke rup gathan main 'ng', 'na' tathaa 'na' kaa koi yoga nahin he
 The sweetness that is in 'N' and 'M' is not in these three
 isiilie hindi ne 'na' tathaa 'm' ko hi apanaaya he
 Sanskrit words which are used in Hindi, they come in them - 'vaamay', 'chanchalya', 'panditya' etc

 Operant conditioning is sensitive to behavior, or controlled by its consequences, which is a learning process

 For example, rallying a child with the sight of a colored wrapper or a child's trembling with the sound of a door slam, which the angry parent signals

 a cat can escape from the box by a simple reaction such as pulling a rope or pushing a pole, but cats take a long time to get out when first constrained
 
 With repeated tests ineffective reactions occurred less frequently and successful responses occurred more often, so cats escaped more and more rapidly

 skinner ko praayah condishning ke janak ke rup main janaa jaataa he According to Skinner's proactive adaptation theory, the consequences of behavior affect the probability of action
 ek vyavhaar jiske pashchaat ek sukhadaayak uddipak judaa hua ho, uske baar-baar hone kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he, lekin yadi doosraa vyavhaar kisi dandatmak uddipak se judaa ho to uske hone kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he
 For example, if a child reacts to a behavior by a grin, the child is more likely to react to that behavior
 lekin agar aise vyavhaar ke liye gusse kii pratikriya di jaae to us vyavhaar ke dubaara pradarshit karne kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he
 For example, according to Skinner, a child may develop embarrassing behavior based on the experiences present in his environment
 If the environment is reestablished, the child may become socially efficient

 In Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix, Hermione Granger makes fake, incantated galleons that members of Dumbledore's army use to interact with each other
 Like real galleons, these coins also have numbers written around the edge, in ordinary galleons these serial numbers indicate which Pisach has thrown them, but in the incanted coins these numbers indicate the day and time of the next visit
 And Harry Potter changes all the coins according to the time or date on his coin
 Due to the magic of Protian spells on these coins, once Harry Potter changed his coin's information by coin, all other coins also show the same information
 When the inscribed digits are changed on them, these coins start heating up, by which it alerts the members to pay attention to the information of the coin

 The Deluminator is a device invented by Albus Dumbledore, which looks like a normal cigarette lighter
 It is used to remove or absorb light from a light source and subsequently reflect it to maintain user privacy
 In Harry Potter and the Philosophers' Stone, Dumbledore used the Deluminator to darken the private drive, where the Dursley family home was located
 iske baad is upkaran ko order of da finnics main dekha gaya, jahaan dambaldor apana dilumineter mudi ko udhaar detaa he, jo iskaa prayog harry ko darsli parivaar ke ghar se number 12, grimuld pales pahunchane ke liye karata he
 half blad prince main, dambaldor ek baar punah harry ko le jane se pehle privet drive main andhera karne ke liye dilumineter kaa prayog karte hai
 Finally in the Deathly Hallows, it is first indicated with the name Deluminator
 Dumbledore owes it to Ron
 When Rob does not leave his angry friend, the delaminator is used as a home appliance to demonstrate his extra qualities
 Ron hears Hermione's voice with this device when she calls him by his name, when he clicks the device, the light from it enters his body and spells it around Harry and Hermione's camp

 Invisibility cloaks hide the wearer from being visible, that is, it will not be visible to anyone by the eyes but can be felt by touching it and it cannot disappear the solid body of the wearer, just make it invisible
 However, Alastair Moody's magic mantle eyes see the invisibility cloak
 Creatures such as cats and snakes rely more on other senses that are not affected by visibility, such as sniffing, hearing, and sensation of heat, etc
, so invisibility cloaks are not very successful at hiding from these creatures
 The dementors described in the book do not activate the viscera, but instead they have a sense of human disappointment, this is also a sense that is not affected in any way by the invisibility cloak
 yah mana jaataa he ki harry ke clok ke alaava, mudi ke paas bhi aise do clok hai
 inamen se ek stergis padmor se order of finnics kitaab main liya gaya tha

 The Hand of Glory is described in Bourgin & Berks as a large wrinkled hand placed on a cushion
 In the film Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, when Harry puts his hand on a hand of glory, he has a lot of trouble getting his hand back
 When a candle is placed on this hand of glory, it only gives light to the person who is holding it
 It was first mentioned in the Chamber of Secrets when Draco and his father, Lucius Malfoy, go to the dark arts shop Bourgin & Berks at Knockturn Ale
 Lucius refuses Draco's request to buy it, saying it is a device used by ordinary thieves
 In the sixth book, Draco uses it as he leaves the room of the environment, nishiddh kitabon main shaamil hai: Some unnamed items found in Bourgin & Berks nocttern aile main milane vaali vasteen Items found at Number 12 Grimmauld Place dethale hellos teen jaadui vasteen hai or harry potter and da dethale hellos kitaab inhen in par kendrit he

 olivander se baat karne ke baad wo yah maanane par vivash ho gayi ki ye sab vastav main sach he
 According to The Tale of Beadle the Bard's The Tale of Three Brothers, the Paveral Brothers acquired Death
 death ne unhen unki ichha kii kisi bhi vastu maangane kaa prastaav diya; pehle bhai ne ek aisi chadi maangi jise ladaai main haraaya na ja sake, duusare ne kisi mrit vyakti ko waapas laane ke upaay ke bare main poocha or tisare bhai ne aisa clok maanga jo use pahanane vaale ko mrityu kii nazaron se bhi chupa sake
 rouling ke anusaar, in vastuon ke astitv kii kahani geoffrey chausar kii da pardenurs tail par aadhaarit he
 The Elder Wand, known throughout history as the Deathstick and Wand of Destiny, is an extremely powerful wand made by a core of thestral tail hair in Elder's wood
 It is reportedly the most powerful wand that exists and when used by its actual owner, it cannot be defeated in any duel battle, although according to Dumbledore it is a lie, as they have used black magic
 The Elder Wand was defeated in his historic heroic battle with the performing magician Grindwald
 yah bhi prathit hota he kii yah vaind apanvaastavik maalik ko kisi bhi dasha main koi vaastavik nuksaan nahin pahunchaayegi kyonki yah vaind kuch samvedansheel he 
 jaisaa ki vaind banaanevaale mistar
 olivander ne kaha, vaind kisi bhi nae upyogkarta ke liye tab tak puri tarah se kaam nahin karegi jab tak ki vaind ke nae maalik ne uske puraane maalik ko sidhe nirstra, achet yaa maaraa na ho 
 rouling ne kaha he ki, apane maalik ke chunaav main yah vaind bahut hi krur he, jabaki anya sabhi vaind apane puraane maalik ke prati kuch nishthaa rakhti hai, lekin elder vaind sirf shaktishaalee vyakti ke liye kaam karti he
 yadi iskaa maalik bina kisi se haare swaabhaavik mrityu se mar jaataa he to, iske baad kisi bhi maalik ke liye vaind kii sabhi shaktiyab samaapt ho jaayengi, kyonki vah ise iske puraane maalik se jeet nahin sakaa
 The power of Elder Wand was first shown in the story when Antioch Paveral, the first and oldest of the three legendary brothers, fought with the man whom they had long defeated
 He won and left his enemy's dead body on the ground there
 garv ke saath apni kabhi na haraayi ja sakane vaali vaind kii prashansa karne ke baad, peveral kii neend main hi ek shatru dwaara htya kar di gayi, jo us vaind ko apane adhikaar main lenaa chahta tha
 Since then, magicians hungry for magic power have been searching for Wand and this is one of the three hallows that can be easily accessed through history
 It eventually came under the control of Gregorovich, who was the builder of a Bulgarian wand
 gregorovich bhi ghamand ke saath is vaind ke bare main baaten karata tha, use aisa lagata tha ki isse vah mashhoor ho jaayegaa, jab use olivander ke saath muqabla karnaa padaa to usne us vaind ke rahasy par reverse ingeniyar kaa bhi prayaas kiya
 iske baad yah galert grindlewald ke adhikaar main chali gayi, jisane ise gregorovich se chura liya tha
 Dumbledore eventually defeated Grindlewald and then took Elder Wand under his control
 Dumbledore believed that "out of the three hallows, it is only hello, which he is apt to keep, not to proudly possess it or to kill anyone, but to keep it under his control
" " jab dambaldor ne severas snep dwaara apni mrityu sunishchit kar lee, tab bhi unka iraadaa yahi tha ki antat snep "ke haathon main elder vaind jaae
" kyonki unki mrityu unke haarane se nahi honi thi or dambaldor kaa sochna tha ki isse us vaind kii sabhi shaktiyaan samaapt ho jaayengi
 haalanki, dreko malphoy ne snep dwaara dambaldor kii htya kiye jane se pehle hi dambaldor ko nirstra kar diya tha, isliye yah yojana vifal ho gayi thi - is prakaar dreko anjaane main vaind kaa nayaa maalik ban gaya haalanki vah kabhi bhi dambaldor se bhautik rup main is vaind ko nahin paa sakaa or elder vaind dambaldor ke mrit sharir ke saath unki samadhi main rakh di gayi
 In the final book, Voldemort learns about Wand and sets out in search of him, eventually finding that Wand was with Dumbledore
 He opens the tomb of Dumbledore and takes the wand under his control
 He also mistakenly believes that Snape is the current owner of the wand, Voldemort kills Snape and he does not know that the wand is under Draco
 Subsequently, upon Voldemort's non-knowledge, Harry disarms Drake and takes his wand, so the Elder Wand now falls under Harry
 battle of hallverts main harry ke saath apane antim mukaable ke dauraan use yah pataa chalata he ki elder vaind vastav main uske niyantran main nahin he, kyonki usne is vaind ko iske purv maalik kii htya dwaara praapt nahin kiya he
 iske baavjood bhi, voldemort harry ke expeliarmas charm ke jawaab main apane antim kiling kars ko prabhavi karne ke liye elder vaind kaa hi prayog karata he
 lekin chunki vaind harry ke adheen thi, voldemort dwaara prabhavi kiya gaya kars ulta us par hi chal jaataa he or vah ek hi baar main uski mrityu ho jaati he
 iske baad, harry swayan elder vaind kaa prayog apni karaab ho chuki holly or phinics ke pankh se bani windo kii marammat ke liye karata he or kahata he ki vah "unke saath hi zyada khush he
" During an interview, Rowling revealed that the first executive title for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was Harry Potter and the Elder Wand
 risarection stone, ise rakhane vaale ko mrit logon se sampark karne main samarth banataa he
 dethale hellos ke udgam ke sambandh main prachali dantakatha ke anusaar, risarection stone ke istemaal ke falswaroop iske vaastavik maalik, cadamas peverel, ne apni mrit mangetar ko dekh to liya kintu vastav main uske saath nahin praapt kar paane ke kaaran usne aatmahatya kar lee
 jab is stone ko marvolo gaunt ke adhikaar main dekha gaya tab tak, ise ek anguthi main sthapit kiya ja chukaa tha jis par ki dethale hellos kaa chinh bana hua tha, jinke bare main gaunt kaa maananaa tha ki yah peverel kaa kulchinh he
 dambaldor or grindelawald donon hi is stone par adhikaar chaahate the, kintu alag-alag kaarnon se
 dambaldor ise apane mrit parivaar se sampark karne ke liye chahta tha, jabaki grindal wald iskaa prayog laashon kii sena taiyaar karne ke liye karnaa chahta tha
 Not knowing the magic powers of this ring, Voldemort turned it into a horcrux
 dambaldor ne is anguthi ko marvolo kii vaiyaktik sampatti se praapt kiya tha, unhone is ek horkrax or dethale hellos main se ek, donon hi roopon main pahchaan liya tha
 Dumbledore forgot that the ring was a horcrux and Voldemort might have tied it to a curse, so inspired by his personal desire, he used it to contact his dead family
 However, as a result of this curse, his hand was destroyed and the effect of this curse spread throughout his body
 Although the effect of the curse was somewhat destroyed by Snape and left in a blackened hand, Dumbledore was still blighted and now he had only a year left to live
 baad main snitch ke andar chipaayi gayi dambaldor kii vasiyat ke anusaar is stone kaa adhikaar harry ko mil gaya, apane pehle quiddich match ke dauraan harry is snitch ko lagbhag nigalane hi vaala tha
 The nose message touched Harry's lips when "I opened close"
 Snitch had the message "I open at the close" when touched by Harris Lips
 Harry didn't know Snitch until he opened
 Does not reach the last moment of his death, and he realizes that "the Close" means the end, or the end of his life, that is, death
 Harry uses this stone to contact his parents, Sirius and Remus Lupine
 for Literacy is, he wanted to console Rimes Lupine before Voldemort
 varjit jangal main yah stone harry kii samvedanheen ho gayi ungaliyon se sarak jaataa he
 baad main dambaldor kii tasviir ke saath harry yah nirnay letaa he ki na to vah ise talash karne kii koshish karegaa or na hi dusron ko batayega ki yah stone kahaan he
 2007 main hue saakshaatkaar main, rouling ne kaha ki may to yaheen vishwaas karnaa chaahuungi ki yah ek centaur ke khuron dwaara hameshaa ke liye zamin main dab gaya he
 According to legend, the cloak of invisibility has the power to hide the wearer from the dead
 This is a real invisibility cloak, by real it means that it does not allow the wearer to be visible in any way and time or mantra is also not affected
 In Deathly Hallows, it is revealed that Harry's cloak is actually one of the Deathly Hallows
 In fact it belonged to Ignotus Peverell
 uski maut ke baad, yah clok pita se putr ko mil gaya or peverel ke vanshajon se hota hua james potter ko praapt hua
 jis raat james kii maut hui thi us raat yah clok james ke paas nahin tha; usne pehle hi yah clok dambaldor ko de diya tha, jo dethale hellos main bahut dilchaspee rakhte the
 dambaldor ne kai varshon baad yah clok harry ko hogavarts main uske pehle saal ke dauraan christmas ke tohfe ke rup main waapas kar diya
 puri shrinkhalaa ke dairan harry anekon saahasik karnaamon ke antargat skool ke aasapaas chori chhipe ghoomane ke liye is clok kaa istemaal karata he
saatvin kitaab main, xenophilis lavagud tisare hello kaa varnan karte hue kehete hai ki yah ek "vaastavik" invizibility clok he: anya clok samay ke saath yaa to kharaab ho jate hai yaa apane pahanane vaale ko puri tarah se adrishy rakhane kii unki kshamta kam hoti jaati he lekin hellos ke antargat aane vaala yah clok na to kabhi purana hoga or na hi kabhi nasht hoga
 yah clok itnaa bada tha ki isamen harry ke saath-saath ron or harmion bhi aasaani se aa sakate the or ve praayah aisa karte bhi the, haalanki shrinkhalaa ke dauraan ve jaise-jaise bade hote ja rahe the vaise-vaise un teenon kaa ek saath isamen aa paanaa mushkil hota ja rahaa tha
 At the end of the Deathly Hallows, Dumbledore explains to Harry that the real magic of the cloak is that it can keep its owner as well as other people invisible
 This fact becomes clear when the cloak does not react to the summoning charm of the Death Eaters while hiding Harry, Ron, and Hermione in the seventh book
 apane pahanane vaale ko yah clok jaaduugaron or jaadui shaktiyon se rahit logon ke saamne adrishy rakhata he, lekin kuch jeev aise hai jinhen iske andar chhipe hue vyakti kaa abhas ho jaataa he
 udahaaran ke liye, saanp, jo invizibility clok ke andar dekh to nahin sakate lekin ve gati or garmi kaa ehsaas kar lete hai or isiilie ve iske andar chhipe logon ko khoj sakate hai
 mises noris, flitch kii billi bhi harry ko dekhte hue prathit hote hai, jab vah ise pahanakar ghumta he
 ise pahanane vaale "homenum charm" dwaara bhi pakade ja sakate hai
 gaublate of fire main, mudi ki jaadui aankh bhi clok ke andar harry ko dekh leti he, is par clok ke dethale hellos main se ek hone kaa koi prabhaav nahin padataa, kyonki clok kaa yah gun use avashya hi us mantra ke viruddh prabhaavasheel nahin banataa jo ki mudi kii aankh par daalaa gaya he
 haalanki yah nishkarsh adhuraa he kyonki jis prakaar mudi kii ankhen bahusari chizon ko dekh paati hai us sambandh main koi bhi varnan nahin diya gaya he
 prisionar of ajbakaan main, dambaldor harry ko yah chetavanee dete hai ki manushyon ke sambandh main demerts kaa grahabodh invizibility clok dwaara simit nahin he, kyonki ve bhaawanaaon ke aadhaar par logon kaa anubhav karte hai
 Fo-glass is a glass that recognizes the enemies of its owner and shows them outside its center or center, depending on the distance from their glass
 However, like all other black detectors, it can be fooled, as mentioned in the fifth book by Harry at the beginning of the first DA meeting
 Moody, actually Barty Crouch Jr
 in disguise, claims that when the white parts of his eyes are visible, it means he is in trouble
 In Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix, when Harry's Room of Requirement was used, D
A
 Fo-glass hangs in the same room
 maraders map james potter, syrius blike, rimas lupin or peter petigryu dwaara banaaya gaya hogavarts kaa ek jaadooi nakshaa he, in logon ne ise tab banaaya tha jab ye sabhi hallverts main padhate the or inhen praayah raat ke dauraan kiye jane vaale saahasik karnaamon ke falswaroop skool ke maidaanon or kai gopneey raaston adi ke bare main vistrut jaankaree ho gayi thi
 At first glance, the map appears to be a plain piece of leather; But when the user uses it and says it to them, "I solemnly swear that I'm up to no good
", Then the message is "messrs
 Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs, Parables of AIDS to Magical Mischief" -makers, Are Proud to Present the Maraders Map "and a detailed outline of hog warts are shown
 This map shows the position of the people inside the fort of Hogwarts and its plains and includes the position of the secret paths and directions to reach them
 However, many places such as the Room of Requirements and the Chamber of Secrets do not appear in this map, perhaps because the Marauders did not know about them or perhaps because it was not possible to mark places such as the Room of Requirements
 iske saath, anemagus disgis, polizeoos poshan or invizibility clok ke dwaara ise chakma nahin diya ja saktaa tha, jaisaa gaublate of fire main dikhaaya gaya he ki barty crouch junior swayan ko mudi ke chhadam bhesh main laane ke liye polizeoos poshan kaa prayog karata he,saanchaa:hp4 or prisionar of ajbakaan main peter petigryu, jo mrit mana jaataa haisaanchaa:hp3 lekin ek anemagus hone ke chalate chuuhe main roopantarit ho chukaa he, isliye yah donon hi is naqshe par dikhaayi padate hai
 "mischif menaged!" kehane se, yah nakshaa punah ek sade charm-patr main badal jaataa he
 In The Prisoner of Azkaban, Fred and George Weasley, who no longer need the map, pass it on to Harry so that he can reach Hogsmeade via a secret passage
 Fred and George stole this map from a drawer in Filch's office, in which the dangerous and confiscated objects are kept; Lupine unravels the secret that maybe Filch knows what this map is but he doesn't know how to use it
 Snape later retrieves the map from Harry and forces him to reveal its secret, but Nakha insults Snape with ridiculous phrases just as the Maraders would have done if they were there to present the map
 The cooks were with Snape while studying in Hogwarts and were among Snape's biggest enemies from school time
 Lupine, currently a teacher of Defense Against Dark Arts, Is called to inspect this "secret magic item" and confiscates it to keep Harry safe, although he returns it to Harry after Hogwarts resigned as teacher
 Since then, the map has become a major tool in Harry's continued adventures, and is only mentioned in context during its use
 filmon ke liye banaaye gaye is naqshe ke vastu rup main, pehali drushti main isapar likhi panktiyaan kuch aniyamit aksharon ke rup main hoti hai, lekin dhyaan se dekhne par pataa chalata he ki Mantras and hidden magical objects of the probity probe convictions are detected

 Rememberball is a small, transparent ball filled with smoke that turns red when the user forgets anything
 Unfortunately, it does not tell the user what he has forgotten, which makes it somewhat useless
 In Philosophers Stone, a much-forgotten naval longbottom is sent a rematchball by his grandmother
 During Harry's first year, Draco Malfoy steals it and throws it during a flight practice session, which results in Harry being chased by a broomstick, and Mac catches it just a few inches before Gonagall's window
 The first sample of Harry's brilliant performance on the broomstick resulted in him being given the rank of Seeker in the Gryffindor Quidditch Squad
 Their use is restricted during OWL, the reason for this is that the students are aware that the answer written by them is wrong
 philosophers stone kii dividi main reememberbal kaa ek software samroop bhi he
 The revealer is a ruddy red colored rubber, which also makes invisible ink visible
 It first appeared in the Chamber of Secrets when Hermione attempted to read the handwriting of Tom Riddle's diary
 sikresi sensor ek dark detector hota he jiskaa varnan "ek aisi vastu jo kuch zyada hi tedi-medhi or sunahare rang ke television anti jaisi dikhaati thi
" jab yah jhooth or kisi chipaayi gayi chiz ko pakadta he to isamen compann hoti he
 harry potter and gaublate of fire main, mudi kahata he ki, "jaahir he ki is chiz kaa yahaan upyog nahin he, yahaan to har disha se hastkshep hoga-- kyonki har taraf chaatr apana grihakaarya na karne ke bahaanon ke sambandh main jhooth bolte rahete hai
 haalanki, ho saktaa he mudi aisa isliye kah rahaa tha kyonki vastav main to vah barty crouch junior tha joki polizeoos poshan ke prayog se mudi bana hua tha
 In the Order of Phoenix, it is shown that the secret sensor is used at the atrium desk when local government visitors arrive at the Ministry of Magic
 Later in the book, Harry says that they too can be dodged like other dark-detecting counterparts
 In Half Blood Prince, Argus Filch is given the responsibility to investigate every student entering the fort with the help of secret censors, due to the new hard security of the Hog Warts
 All owls flying in Hogwarts have also been given the responsibility under this arrangement that no secret magical object should be allowed to enter Hogwarts through letter
 Later, Hermione suggests that secret censors can catch jinxes, curses, and concealment charms, but they cannot catch love potions because they do not fall under secret magical objects
 snicoscope ek prakaar kii gopneey jaadui vastu he
 is upkaran ke varnan main bataaya gaya he ki yah ek laghukrit kaanch kaa ghumta hua sheersh he jo kisi bhi prakaar ke dhokhe kii avasthaa main tikhi awaajen nikaalata he, udahaaran ke taur par, jab koi avishwasaneey vyakti aasapaas hota he yaa jab aasapaas koi chhalpurna ghatana ghatit hoti he
 Sneakoscope came into the story from The Prisoner of Azkaban, when Harry is given a pocket-sized version of it by Ron on his thirteenth birthday
 Sneakoscopes appear again in the Hogwarts Express, followed by Harry and Rob's dormitory
 Harry later learns that Ron's rat, the Scrabbers, who is always present during the running of the Snickoscope, is actually Peter Pettigrew in animagus form
 In Goblet of Fire, the somewhat eccentric Moody has several sneakoscopes that he has somehow deactivated, claiming that "its siti won't stop ringing
" However, it was later revealed that Moody was in fact Barty Crouch Jr
 who was under the influence of Polyjuus Potion, so his presence indicated it to be constantly wary
 ant main, dethale hellos main, harmion ne harry ko uske satrahawein janmdin par ek snicoscope diya tha, jiskaa prayog un logon ne chhip kar rahane ke dauraan ek chaukeedaar ke rup main kiya
 The Weasley family had a special watch in the house, The Borough, which had 9 needles, each needle for different members of the family
 Instead of telling the time, this house used to tell the status of those members
 Its known conditions were: Home, School, Work, Travel, Missing, Hospital, Jail, Quidditch and Mortal Peril
 The Weasley family is the only family mentioned in this series that has such a clock
 Dumbledore calls this watch "wonderful" and seems impressed, it is a very powerful device

saanchaa:hp6 Exploding Snap is a magical card game in which the cards suddenly explode during the game
 The game is very popular among Hogwarts students
 Harry and Ron are late to find out why so many spiders are fleeing the hogwarts, this is because Fred and George had trapped them in a similar game
 exploding snap ke patton dwaara taash kaa ek ghar banane ke dauraan ron kii bhauhen jhulas jaati hai

 Gobestons is one of the many games played by young wizards in this book
 These games also included Wizards Chase and Exploding Snap
 Gobustons are similar to games played by marbles and stones by people devoid of magical powers, the only difference being gobstons in that the ball spits a dirty smelling substance at their player's mouth when the opposing team loses a point
 is
 Throughout the book there is a description of Hobwarts students playing gobestons, not so much a school as there was a gobstons club
 harry potter shrinkhalaa main yah bhi dhyaan dene vaali baat he ki eleen prince, ek chaatr ke rup main 15 varsh kii umr main hallverts ke gobastons club kii captain thim
 The Quidditch devices come with a quaffle, which requires the chaser to traverse the 3 rings in the field, with 2 bursers that move around to harass people and topple them with their broomstick, In this game there is a golden snitch, it is very sharp and almost like a golden shell in the shape of a walnut, which is chased by each team
 And to finish the game and get 150 points it is very important to catch it
 Quidditch's players also wear gloves, foot pads and sometimes sunglasses and padded headguards
 chambers of sicrates main, self-shafling cards kii ek gaddi kaa zikr ron ke kamare kii zamin par faili hui gandagi ke rup main kiya gaya he
 Wizards' Chase is played by real chess-like boards and its pieces, the only difference being that its pieces are live and they actually destroy each other when the opponent is eating
 In this, players command the pieces to move by algebraic chess signals and the pieces follow these orders
 These pieces attack each other when an opponent's piece is taken, usually by dropping the caught piece and pulling it off the board
 Ron has a set of the game given by his grandfather and for the first time Harry plays it with pieces borrowed from Seamus Finnigan
 It was reported that during his play, the pieces were shouting and suggesting that he did not trust Harry
 baad main, hallverts main apane pehle christmas ke dauraan harry ko apane vijard craikar main ek aisa hi shatranj kaa set miltaa he

 Recently, the Digostini Company has released a magazine series called Harry Potter Chase, based on the giant humanized game of the film version of the Philosophers' Stone and also contains all the pieces of chess come alive
 Its chess pieces are based on the huge pieces of the film
 Arco Toys and others also offer wizard chase sets
 horcrax ek gopneey jaadu kii vastu he jiskaa prayog amartv praapt karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 yah avadharana pehali baar harry potter and da half blad prince main ai thi, haalanki pichley upanyaason main bhi horkrax maujuud the kintu ve is prakaar pahachaane nahin gaye the
 horkrax banane ke liye ek htya kii aavashyaktaa hoti he yah prakat karne ke liye rouling horess slogahorn ke varnanaatmak samvaad kaa prayog karti he, jo param buraai kaa kaary hone ke falswaroop, "aatma ko tukdon main baant detaa he"
 htya ke baad, aatma ke alag hue bhaag ko kisi vastu main daalane ke liye ek jaadu kiya jaataa he or yah vastu horkrax ban jaati he
 rouling ne isse samnaadhit vaastavik jaadu ko kabhi prakashit nahin kiya
 shrinkhalaa kii antim kitaab main, harmion sicrates of da darkest arts naamak kitaab main yah mantra paati he
 rouling ne yah bataaya ki unhone sochaa tha ki vah horkrax banane kii prakriya or ise banane main prayukt hone vaale mantron ke vishay main apane lambe samay se charchit, harry potter cencychlopedia main vistaar se bataatin
 Both organisms and non-living animals are used to make horcruxes, although the use of organisms in this is risky, as any living being can defend itself and think
 The number of horcruxes a magician can create is unlimited
 However, the soul of the creator is gradually divided into many small pieces, so he loses his natural humanity and his soul becomes very temporary
 Under very specific circumstances, the soul of the creator of a piece of soulcan be locked into an object without any intention
 The object in which the piece of the soul will be protected in this way will preserve the immortality of the creator just like any other horcrux, but it will not come under the "secret magical object"
 The only example of such an incident is when Voldemort inadvertently used the Killing Curse on a year's Harry Potter
 is hatya ke prayaas main volde mock mort kaa sharir nasht ho gaya tha or uski aatma kaa ek bhaag harry ke andar sthapit ho gaya tha
 Horcruxes are extremely difficult to destroy
 They cannot be destroyed by conventional methods such as crushing, breaking and burning
 To be destroyed, a horcrux has to be subjected to such terrible torture that it would be impossible to repair it in any magical way
 Very few magical objects or spells have the power to do so
 Once a horcrux is destroyed in such a way that it cannot be repaired, then the part of the soul present in it is also destroyed
 The only way to magically free a horcrux is that the person who created it must repent for the murder committed for it
 The pain caused by this repentance is so painful that the person can die even during this process
 voldemort dwaara horkrax kaa banaaya janaa harry potter ke baad ke upanyaason kaa kendriya kathanak tha
 Because seven is a powerful, mysterious number and Voldemort tried to divide his soul into seven parts, six of it were horcruxes and the last part of the soul was in his body
 jab voldemort ne potter parivaar par akraman kiya to uskaa iraadaa "chaynit bachche" kii htya dwaara apana antim horkrax banane kaa tha
 Despite his defeat, he actually managed to do so; When his body was damaged due to the reflection of the Killing Curse, a part of his soul was separated and joined to the only other living object in that room - Harry Potter - and thus became the sixth Horcrux Was
 voldemort is baat se anjaan tha or usne apane saanp nagini ko ek horkrax banane ke dwaara apane kaam ko "anjaam" diya, is prakaar usne apni aatma ko saat kii jagah kul aath bhaagon main baant diya 
 is kaaran sthiti or bhi jatil ho gayi, kyonki shrinkhalaa main kabhi bhi ek baar main chah se adhik horkrax astitv main nahin rahe: jab tak nagini ko ek horkrax banaaya gaya, tab tak asli horkrax main ek nasht bhi kiya ja chukaa tha
 All of Voldemort's forcible horcruxes were made using objects that were important to him or that had emotional value in his life
 upanyaas kii shrankhla main nimna horcrex kaa varnan aata he: Goblet of Fire is a cup made of wood and is used before every treewizard competition
 It is commonly used to select school champions participating in the competition, in which it acts as an "impartial judge"
 Template: HP4 Putting the names of potential candidates on paper slips in this cup Go, at a certain time, when a slip of name comes out of this cup in the fountain of magical fire, a representative is elected from each school
 is
 Once Moody's pseudo-disguise says that Goblet of Fire is "an extremely powerful magical object" and is very difficult to dodge, unless someone uses the powerful Confundus Charm
 gaublate of fire main iske prayog ke dauraan ise pravesh haul main rakhaa jaataa he or iske chaaron ore ek "age line" khinchi jaati he, joki kam aayu vaale jaaduugaron ko pratiyogita main pravesh karne se rokane hetu dambaldor dwaara lagaaya gaya ek charm he

 jab yah prayog main nahin hota to is pyaale ko maniyon se saje aabhushanon ke sandook main rakh diya jaataa he
 The sword of Godric Gryffindor is a sword made by a goblin with large beads on its hilt
 It was once owned by Godric Gryffindor, one of the medieval founders of Hogwarts
 In the Chamber of Secrets, Harry extracts this sword from a sorting hat to kill a basalisk
 The sword also plays a part in the Deathly Hallows, where it appears that the sword contained Basilisk's poison and was used to destroy Voldemort's three horcruxes
 chunki yah talwaar gaublin talwaar kii nakal thi, isliye ise nasht nahin kiya ja saktaa tha or griphuk ke anusaar yah talwaar mul rup se gaublin raganuk dwaara banaayi gayi thi or grifinder ne ise "churaayaa" tha
 In the seventh book, Griphook stole this sword when it slipped from Harry's hold during a raid in Bellatrix Lastrange's vault
 haalanki, kitaab main baad main yah punah manushyon ke haath lag jaati he, jab navial ne ise sorting hat se nikaalkar voldemort ke saanp nagini kaa sar kaat diya tha
 This makes it clear that, no matter where that hat is at some point, but whenever a true member of Gryffindor House needs it, it will come back to the hat
 apni webchait main rouling ne is baat kii pushti kii ki grifinder ne yah talwaar raganuk se churaayi nahin thi or aisa maananaa griphuk ke jaaduugaron ke prati avishvaas kaa ek hissaa he
 Based on the ancient rhetoric of the Philosophers' Stone, The Philosophers' Stone is a stone commissioned by Nicholas Flamel, first mentioned in Harry Potter and the Philosophers' Stone
 yah pathar is liye prasidd he kyonki yah sabhi dhaatuon ko sone main badal detaa he or iskaa prayog amrit banane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, jise pine vaala amar ho jaayegaa
 philosophers stone kaa zikr sirf pehali kitaab main hi he
 is kitaab ke ant main yah flamel kii sahmati se dambaldor dwaara nasht kar diya jaataa he
 philosophers stone kaa zikr ek baar phir harry potter and da gaublate of fire main voldemort dwaara kiya jaataa he, jab vah apane deth itors ko yah bataa rahaa hotahai ki uski shuruuaati haar or punarjanm ke bich kya-kya hua tha
 The Sorting Hat is a visionary work used in Hogwarts, which magically determines which of the four houses in the school - the Gryffindor, the Hufflepuff, the Ravencla or the Slitherin - will be assigned to which house
 At the beginning of the school session, this hat is worn on the head of every first year student
 Hat narrates his selection to everyone with a loud voice and the student walks towards the house selected for him
 This hat talks to students during this sorting process, according to Harry's self-sorting incident and Hermione's brief comment in the fifth book, and is also willing to prioritize student choice in making their decision
 She lives However, at times, he does not have to: For example, Draco Malfoy had Hat send him to Slitherin without touching his head
 harry ko sahi house main niyukt karne main is hat ko parashani hui thi, hat ne use sliderin main bhejne kaa nirnay lagbhag le hi liya tha ki tabhi harry ne usase vishesh rup se spashtatah aisa na karne kii prarthana kii
 is par hat ne use sliderin ke sthaan par grifinder main bhej diya, jo uske pita kaa bhi house tha
 Rowling said that Hat's indecision with regard to which house Harry should be sent to was that Hat had recognized Voldemort's part within Harry
 sorting hat multah gaudrik grifinder kii thi, joki hallverts ke chaar sansthaapakon me se ek the
 pehle sansthpak apane-apane house ke liye chaatro kaa chayan swayan karte the, lekin phir unhone sochaa ki unki mrityu ke baad yah sab kisi or ko hi karnaa hoga isliye gaudrik grifinder ne apni hat utaar di or use chaatro kaa chunaav karne ko kaha or unka yah upaay kargar rahaa
 tab se, chaatro ke house kaa chayan karne ke liye sorting hat kaa prayog kiya jane laga
 isaki aayu ke kaaran yah "dhabbedaar, ghisi hui or bahut hi gandi" dikhaati he
" prativarsh chaatro ko chhaantane se pehle yah hat ek parichayatmak geet bhi sunaati he
 aamtaur par yah geet aane vaale khataron ke prati aagaah karata he, jaise ki order of finnics main
 sorting hat ke geet vishaywastu or lambaai main badalte rahete hai lekin inamen sadaiv hi prayek house kaa sankshipt parichay shaamil hota he
 The Sorting Hat had also twice pleaded with Gryffindor's sword to move out of its place, both times to kill the snake; In the Chamber of Secrets, it gives Harry this sword to kill Basilisk, and in Deathly Hallows it gives this sword to Navial
 In the Chamber of Secrets, Dumbledore makes it clear that only a true Gryffindor can summon a sword in this way
 At Deathly Hallows, Voldemort sets fire to the Sorting Hat, although it appears that the Hat was not burned in the fire as Naviel quickly removes the Gryffindor's sword from it and strips Voldemort's snake Nagini's head
 
 In the epilogue given at the end of Deathly Hallows, it is ensured that Hat is still in existence as Harry tells his younger son that, harry potter shrinkhalaa kii pahalon do filmon main hat kii awaz lesli philips dwaara di gayi he
 iske geet film main nahin sunaaye gaye hai or film main iskaa gheraa or kahin-kahin par fatne ke nishaan dikhaae gaye hai jisase aisa lagata he ki hat kii "ankhen" or ek "munh" he
 Mirror of Erised is a mysterious mirror discovered by Harry in the Philosophers' Stone in a previous corridor of Hogwarts
 is par likhaa hua he ki "arised stree hruo ytub ekalf ruoyt on voh si"
 jab ise thik se rakhkar ek darpan ke saamne kiya jaataa he to ise is prakaar padhate hai "ai sho not yor phase bat yor hearts dijair"
 "arised" ko palatakar padhane se yah "dijair" ban jaataa he, isliye yah "mirars of dijair" he
 is darpan ko dekhne par, harry, isamen apane mata-pita ko dekhtaa he, or iske saath hi saath apane rishtedaaron ke ek samooh ko; ron is darpan main khud ko headbvaay or quiddich cap liye hue quiddich captain ke rup main dekhtaa he 
 dambaldor harry ko saavdhaan karte hai ki yah darpan na to jaankaree detaa he or na hi sachai or log iske saamne khadey hokar jo dekhte hai usase ve barbaad ho jate hai
 Dumbledore, who is among a few other letters standing in front of this mirror, stating that he had seen himself holding a pair of socks, told Harry that "no man would ever have enough socks"
 And he also expressed regret that he never got socks even at Christmas, because people always wanted to give him books
 However, in Deathly Hallows it is reported that in fact Dumbledore saw his entire family alive and happy and then together in that mirror, just as Harry had seen
 pahalon kitaab main mirar of arised, philosophers stone ko di gayi antim suraksha thi
 dambaldor ne is darpan ko chipa diya tha or philosophers stone ko bhi uske andar chipa diya tha, ve yah jaanate the ki sirf aisa hi koi vyakti yahaan tak pahunch sakegaa jo ise paanaa chaahate hoga lekin iske prayog ko nahin jaanata hoga
 anya koi bhi vyakti swayan ko is shishe main amrit banaate hue yaa vastuon ko sone main badalte hue dekhegaa, na ki philosophers stone ko dhundte hue
 In the Order of Phoenix, Sirius gives Harry a mirror that he actually used to make contact with James during his imprisonment
 yah darpan tu-ve mirar kaa ek hissaa tha, jo apane donon main se ek hisse ko haath main lekar us duusare vyakti kaa naam lene se sakriy hota he jiske paas iskaa doosraa bhaag he, iske sakriy hone par us anya vyakti kaa cheharaa is darpan main aane lagata he or is or baithe vyakti kaa cheharaa duusare vyakti ke darpan main dikhaai dene lagata he
 yah darpan harry ko grimuld place main apni christmas kii chhuttiyaan bitaane ke baad syrius dwaara ek packet main rakhkar diya gaya tha
 At first, Harry decided that he would not open it, although he saw it after the death of Sirius, but then it was no longer usable
 duusari baar yah darpan, "dethale hellos" main aata he jab mundungus flechar grimuld place ko lut letaa he or syrius kaa yah darpan abrforth dambaldor ko bech detaa he, jo dethale hellos main harry kii gatividhiyon par dhyaan rakhane ke liye iskaa prayog karata he
 jab harry jaadui darpan ke ek tukade ke saamne adheer hokar madad ke liye chillaata he, to abrforth kii chamakdaar neeli ankhen, dikhaayi padati hai or vah dobi ko harry kii madad ke liye bhejtaa he, jo harry ko malphoy minar se bhaagane or shell cottage pahunchane main sahaayta karata he
 In the world of wizards, pictures and images are not as static as in the non-magical world
 They move within the frame and move from picture to picture
 They also talk
 In Hogwarts, a picture of a fat woman is used to cover the door of the Gryffindor Common Room and the door opens only when the entrant reveals it to her as a secret code
 Apart from this, there are also many pictures of Hogwarts old principals and headmasters in Dumbledore's office and Dumbledore is shown interacting with him from time to time
 He uses the picture of Sirius Black's great-grandfather Finus Nigelas to contact Sirius and monitors the headquarters of the Order with another photo of him at home

 Drinking a confusing mixture makes the person sick and confused
 During his class of potions in his third year, Harry had to prepare the potion but was unable to thicken it
 harry ne dekha ki snep ek clipboard par kuch likh rahaa he jo sambhawatah ek shunya jaisaa dikh rahaa he
 iske baad vah pareekshan ke liye aata he
 When a person drinks the Drot of Living Death, he goes into such a deep sleep that he appears dead, hence it is named after him
 It is made from the powder of Asphodel root which is then mixed with extracts of wormwood, first mentioned in Harry's first class of Potions with Snape in the Philosophers' Stone and then again by Horace Slughorn in Half Blood Prince It is also mentioned in the first class of Potions taken with, the best formulation of this Potion in Horace Slughorn's first NWT Potion Class
 Neke get the most points to Harry, so half is used the handwritten suggestion Blood Prince
 For this, he is given a bottle of Felix Felice Potion as a reward
 drot of pis chintaa ko shant karata he or uttejnaa ko kam karata he
 order of finnics main, snep harry or uski kaksha ko ise banane kaa aadesh detaa he
 is poshan ko banaan bahut kathin he kyonki sabhi samagriyon ko ek khaas kram main daalana hota he, mishran ko ek nishchit sankhya tak hi ghumaya jaataa he or jis aag main yah garm kiya jaataa he use antim saamagree daalane se pehle bilkul nishchit str tak nishchit samay ke liye dhimaa kiya jaataa he

 Felix Felicis, also known as Liquid Luck, gives it extraordinary pleasure to the drinker
 The timing of its effectiveness will depend on how much it has been drunk
 Due to its properties, it is banned during all sporting events, competitions and examinations
 It looks like liquid gold
 According to Horace Slughorn, overeating has some side effects including greater self-confidence as well as dizziness and exuberance
 In half-blood Prince, Harry pretends to give Ron some amount of it so that he can perform better in Quidditch
 Ron's fate favors him and his confidence in him serves as a placebo
 Harry used it heavily to learn more and more about Tom Riddle and the Horcruxes from Horace Slughorn, and the rest of Ron, Hermione, papessop poshan khaansee or zukam se nijaat dilaane ke liye banaaya jaataa he, haalanki iskaa ek anya bahut khaas parshv prabhaav bhi he: iske seven se kai ghanton baad tak bhi rogi ke kaan se bhaap tapakati rahati he
 Polyjous potion enables the drinker to disguise any other person for one hour
 Its ingredients include fluxweed, notgrass, lacewing flies, leeches, powder of bicorn horn and cut skin of boomslang
 Its final content is any small fraction of the intended person to be assumed; For example, that person's hair is often used for this purpose
 iskaa rup or swaad us vyakti par nirbhar hote prathit hote hai, udahaaran ke liye, harry ke ansh se banaaya gaay poshan sunahare rang kaa tha jabaki kareeb aurgoyal ke ansh se banaaya gaya poshan grey or bhadda tha
 It was first used in the Chamber of Secrets to help Harry and Ron form Crab and Goyal so that they could both question Draco
 In Goblet of Fire, Barty Crouch Jr
 used it to take the form of mad-eye Moody for a whole year, always carrying a full pot of this potion with him so that he could drink it every hour
 In half-blood Prince, Crab and Goyal use this potion to take the form of young timbers while guarding the Room of Requirement
 In the Deathly Hallows, it is first used to make Order members like Harry in order to trick Voldemort and the Death Eaters
 Later, Harry uses it to portray the fictional "barney Weasley" at the wedding of Bill Weasley and Flieur Delacar
 Harry, Ron and Hermione also use it to assume themselves as ministry employees to infiltrate the Ministry of Magic
 Harry and Hermione later form a medieval married couple of non-magical humans during the investigation at Goudrix Hallow, and Hermione eventually takes over to reach Bellatrix's vault in the Gringotts
 polizeoos poshan tabhi thik se kaary karata he jab yaan manushya se manushya kaa rup dhaaran karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he, jaisaa kii harmion ko chembar of sicrates main pataa chalata he ki usne galati se aisi khuraaq pi lee thi jisamen ek billi kaa bal padaa tha, iske falswaroop uske chehre par bal aa jate hai or ek billi jaisi poonch aa jaati he

 is poshan se pine vaale kaa keval shaareerik roopantaran hota he, lekin uske pahanaave par koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 In books, this potion changes the voice of the drinker into the voice of the person who has been taken shape, as well as any physical disability of that person, such as weak eyesight, etc
 However, the films provide conflicting information on this issue
 In the Chamber of Secrets, Harry and Ron's voice remains the same even after drinking potions; The same happens with Harry, Ron and Hermione in Deathly Hallows Part-1
 However, in Goblet of Fire, Barty Crouch Jr
 speaks in his disguise in mad-eye Moody's disguise
 ek aushadhiy poshan he jo lupt / hataayi gayi haddiyon kaa punah vikaas karata he, haalanki iskaa swaad bahut karaab hota he or iske prabhavi hone kii prakriya bahut hi dhimi tathaa kshtakar hoti he
 chembar of sicrates main, quiddich khilne ke dauraan harry kaa haath tut jaataa he or difens against dark arts ke adhyaaapak gilderoy locheart galati se ise thik karne ke sthaan par baaki sari haddiyaan bhi gaayab kar dete hai
 jiske falswaroop, harry ko is poshan kii ek khuraaq lekar raat bhar aspataal main rahanaa padataa he
 Varitasirum is called Truth Serum or Truth Potion
 It is a variant of the Truth Serum or Truth Drug prevalent among non-magical people
 Only three drops of this potion are necessary to get the correct answer to any question from anyone
 An example of its use is found when it is used on Barty Crouch Jr
 in Goblet of Fire
 In the Order of Phoenix, Ambridge uses it while questioning students about their involvement with Dumbledore's army, but Snape says that she has already used all the varitasirum available to her
 In half-blood Prince, Harry was considering the use of this potion to find important memories of Slughorn in relation to Voldemort, but he felt it would be appropriate not to do so, and in Deathly Hallows, Rita used this potion in Bathilda
 Did to learn the story of Dumbledore's childhood from Bagshot
 apni fainsite par rouling ne bataaya ki veritaserum ko auklumency ke prayog se chakma diya ja saktaa he or isliye ise jaaduugaron ke nyaayalayon main aamtaur par istemaal nahin kiya jaataa
