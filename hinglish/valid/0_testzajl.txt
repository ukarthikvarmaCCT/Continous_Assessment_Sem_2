 King Jayachand was a mighty ruler
 uski vishaal sainya vahini sadaiv vicharan karti rahati thi, isliye use ‘dal-pangul' bhi kaha jaataa he
 It is also praised in Prithviraj Raso
 rajasekhar suri ne apane prabandh-kosh main kaha he ki kashiraj jayachandra vijeta tha or ganga-yamuna doaab to uskaa vishesh rup se adhikrut pradesh tha

 tarain ke yuddh main gauri ne prithviraj chouhaan ko parrast kar diya tha
 As a result of this, Muslims were dominated by Delhi and Ajmer
 yahan kaa shashan prabandh gauri ne apane mukhya senapati aibak ko saunp diya or swayan apane desh chalaa gaya tha
 After the Battle of Tarain, Muslims became a permanent state in India
 aibak gauri kaa pratinidhi banakar yahan se shashan chalaane laga
 Two years after this war, Gauri again came with a large army to conquer India
 is baar uskaa kannauj jeetne kaa iraadaa tha
 Kannauj was a prosperous state at that time
 gauri ne uttar bharat main apane vijit ilaake ko surakshit rakhane ke abhipraay se yah akraman kiya
 He knew that he could not maintain his power in India without subjugating the powerful Kannauj kingdom

 Sultan Shahabuddin joined the army of fifty thousand on the way

 The two fought at a place called 'chandavar' near Etawah
 yuddh main raja jayachand hathi par baithkar sena kaa sanchaalan karne laga
 Jayachand did not have an entire army in this war
 senaayen vibhinn kshetron main thi, jayachand ke paas us samay thodi si sena thi
 Unfortunately Jaichand's arrow hit him, leading to his death, Gauri won the battle
 yah yuddh visan 1250 ko hua tha
 Jaichand is charged with sedition
 kaha jaataa he ki usne prithviraj par akraman karne ke liye gauri ko bharat bulaayaa or use sainik sanhaayta bhi di
 In fact, these allegations are baseless
 aise koi pramaan nahin hai jisase pataa lage ki jayachand ne gauri kii sahaayta kii thi
 The other men who called Gauri were malevolent, whose names are mentioned in Prithviraj Raso
 sanyogita prakaran main prithviraj ke mukhya-mukhya samant kaam aa gaye the
 These people secretly informed Gauri that Prithviraj's chief feudal is no more, this is the chance
 tab bhi gauri ko vishwaas nahin hua, usne apane doot fakiron ke bhesh main dilli bheje
 These people stayed secretly with these people
 inhone jaakar gauri ko soochna di, tab jaakar gauri ne prithviraj par akraman kiya tha
 Nityanand Khatri, Pratapsingh Jain, Madhobhatta and Dharmayan Kayastha who were the poets and officials of the Tenvars
 samakaleen itihaas main kahi bhi jayachand ke bare main ullekh nahin he ki usne gauri kii sahaayta kii ho
 All these are fanciful things in modern history
 jayachand kaa prithviraj se koi vaimnasy nahin tha
 He was a bit annoyed by the incident
 us samay prithviraj, jayachand kii krupa se hi bachaa tha
 At the time of coincidence Haran, Jaichand had commanded his army to surround them
 lagaataar paanch din tak prithviraj ko dabaate rahe
 Prithviraj's main chief was employed in the feudal war
 paanchave din sena ne gheraa or kadaa kar diya
 Jaichand moves forward, he sees that Sankrita is sitting on the horse behind Prithviraj
 usne vichaar kiya ki sanyogita ne prithviraj kaa varan kiya he
 If i kill it, it will be a great disaster, the daughter will become a widow
 usne sena ko gheraa todane kaa aadesh diya, tab kahin jaakar prithviraj dilli pahunchaa
 Then Jaichand sent his priest to Delhi, where Prithviraj and Sanyogita married by law
 prithviraj or gauri ke yuddh main jayachand tatasth rahaa tha
 Prithviraj did not even ask for help in this war
 pehle yuddh main bhi sahaayta nahin maangi thi
 If Prithviraj asked for help, Jayachand could have helped
 agar jayachand or gauri main mitrataa hoti to baad main gauri jayachand par akraman kyon karata ? atah yah aarope mithyaa he
 Nowhere in Prithviraj Raso was it said that Jaichand had called Gauri
 isi prakaar samakaleen farsi granthon main bhi is baat kaa sanket tak nahin he ki jayachand ne gauri ko aamantrit kiya tha
 It is a heard and heard thing that has become a trend

 History testifies that Jaichand fought a gallant war with Mohammad Gauri at Chandavar

 The biggest difference between the gimmick and the farce is believed to be that while the farce mostly deals with religious themes and is displayed a little seriously, the gimmick of the gimmick is based on love and heroism and blends satire and tension
 Let's go
 punjab se shuru hokar nautanki kii style tezi se lokapriya hokar puure uttar bharat main fail gai
 The high-ranking people of the society considered it 'cheap' and 'vulgar' but this folk art flourished
 adhiktar samikshakon kaa maananaa he ki 'nautanki swang style kaa hi ek viksit rup he'
 Nautanki stories often take place on a person or an important subject, such as the gimmick of alha-udal
 isi tarah, 'sultanaa daaku' kii nautanki isi naam ke uttar pradesh ke bijanour zile main hue ek daaku kii kahani bataati he
 During the freedom struggle of India, there were many gimmicks on that subject, which inspired the common people to join this struggle
 aajkal dahez-kupratha, aatankwaad or sampradayik ladaai-jhagadon ke viruddh nautankiyan dekhi ja sakati hai
 To maintain audience interest, gimmicks often contain certain elements of courtship that can also be used for obscenity
 isliye bahut si ashleel nautankiyan bhi dedh-sau saal se chalati aa raheen hai, jis se aksar nautanki kii style badnaam bhi hoti ai he
 Traditionally, in order to make money in gimmicks, it was necessary to never let the audience get bored, so most gimmicks were made by combining events of 10 minutes or less in a sequence that would interest the audience in each part
 Attempts to maintain
 kahani dilachasp rakhane ke liye veerta, prem, mazaaq, gane-naachne or dharm ko milaayaa jaataa he or kathakaar prayaas karata he kii darshakon kii bhavanaayen lagaataar upar-neeche hon or badalati rahen
 In Nautanki, the practice of mixing poetry and common colloquialism has been there from the beginning
 paatr aapas main baaten karte hai lekin gahari bhaawanaaon or sandeshon ko aksar tukbandi ke zariye prakat kiya jaataa he
 The songs use instruments such as sarangi, tabla, harmonium and nagade

 His girlfriend says that she is proud of Sultana's bravery: kripaya dhyaan dijiye ki nautanki main aksar hindi-urdu ke parmparik shabdon kaa prayog hota he
 In words such as 'khairat' and 'khuda', the pronunciation of the pointed 'kh' is slightly different from the pointless 'kh' and is similar to words like 'bad' and 'buy'
 isi tarah 'garib' or 'gam' jaise shabdon main bindu-vaale 'ga' kaa uccharan bindu-rahit 'ga' se thodaa alag he or 'galat' or 'gaayab' jaise shabdon se miltaa he
 Ashwamedha is the name of a famous yajna of ancient India
 'saarvbhaum raja' arthath ek chakravarti naresh hi ashwamedh yajna karne kaa adhikari mana jaataa tha, parantu aitarey brahman ke anusaar is ko sampann karne ke liye anya mahatvashaalee rajanyon ko bhi adhikaar tha
 The assurance of the Srauta Sutra states that he who wishes to attain all things, aspires for all victories and wishes to attain all prosperity is entitled to this yagya
 isliye sarvibhaum ke atirikt bhi murdhabhishikt raja ashwamedh kar saktaa tha 
 This seems to be a very ancient yajna because in the two verses of the Rigveda, special description of Ashwamedhi Ashwa and its havan is given
 shatapath tathaa taitiriya brahmanon main iskaa bada hi vishad varnan uplabdh he jiskaa anusaran shrout sutron, valmikiy ramayana, mahabharat ke ashvamedhik parv main tathaa jaimineey ashwamedh main kiya gaya he
 Ashwamedha was started from Phalgun Shukla Ashtami or Navami or Shuklashtami of Jyeshtha month
 aapstamb ne caitra poornima iske liye uchit tithi maani he
 The idolatrous king entered the pavilion in the form of Yajaman and was followed by his four wives, dressed in golden garb, around the neck, accompanied by a number of maidens and princes
 inke padnaam the: mahishi, vavata, parivriktri tathaa palagali 
 Very well-groomed, handsome and scenic horse was chosen for Ashwamedha
 uske sharir par shyaam rang kii abha hoti thi
 He was anointed for this holy work by duly bathing in the pond water
 tab vah sau rajkumaron ke sangrakshan main varsh bhar svachhand ghoomane ke liye chhod diya jaataa tha
 In the absence of horse, three favors were offered daily to Savitradev, and the Brahmin and Kshatriya caste harpist singers chanted hymns every day playing the veena in praise of the king
 pratidin pariplav kaa parayan kiya jaataa tha
 After wandering around Nivighan for a year, when the horse returned safely, the king took initiation
 avashmedh teen sutya diwason kaa ahin yag tha 
 "sutya" refers to Somalata by coddling Somaras
 isamen baarah dikshaayen, baarah upasad or teen sutyaayein hoti thim
 21 Aratni high 21 Upps were presented
 doosraa sutyadivas pradhan or vishesh mahatvashaalee hota tha
 On that day, Ashwamedhi Ashwa along with three other horses was plowed in a chariot and bathed in a pond
 brahmody se taatpary gudh paheliyon kaa poochna or boojhna hota he
 Then the king used to sit on Vyaghrachama or Singhcharam
 tisare din upang yag hote the or rutvijon ko bhuri dakshina di jaati thi
 Hota, Brahma, Adhvaryu and Udgata were given the wealth of the conquered countries in the east, south, west and north directions respectively in Dakshina and Ashwamedha was considered rich in this method
 ashwamedh ek pratikatmak 'yoga' he jiske prayek ansh kaa gudh rahasy he
 Ashwamedhyagi in Aitareya Brahmana is a very important historical instruction of the ancient Chakravarti kings
 aitihaasik kaal main bhi brahman raajaaon ne yaa vaidikidharmanuai raajaaon ne ashwamedh kaa vidhaan bade hi utsaah ke saath kiya
 Ashwamedha of King Dasharatha and Yudhishthira are said to have concluded in ancient times

 The Gupta emperor Samudragupta also introduced Ashwamedha in the fourth century AD, which is introduced to his Ashwamedhi currencies
 dakshin ke chalukya or yadav nareshon ne bhi yah parampara jari rakhi
 The last king of this tradition seems to be the last king of Jaipur, Sawai Jai Singh, the Maharaja of Jaipur, by whom Ashwamedha Yajna is described by Sri Krishna Bhatt Kavikalanidhi in the "ishvaravilas epic" and Mahananda Pathak in his "ashwamedhpaddhati"

 The Dattatreya Upanishad is a Upanishad under the Atharvaveda branch
 yah upanishad sanskrit bhashaa main likhit he
 Its creators are believed to be the sages of the Vedic period but mainly Vedavas ji is considered the author of many Upanishads
 upanishdon ke rachanakaal ke sambandh main vidwaanon kaa ek mat nahin he
 Some Upanishads have been considered as part of the original codes of the Vedas
 ye sarvaadhik pracheen hai
 Some Upanishads are considered portions of 'brahman' and 'aranyak' texts
 inkaa rachanakaal samhitaon ke baad kaa he
 There is no definite opinion about the period of the Upanishads, the period of the general Upanishads is believed to have been composed from 3000 BC to 500 BC upanishdon ke kaal-nirnay ke liye nimna mukhya tathyon ko aadhaar mana gaya he— The composition of the various Upanishads has been considered by the following scholars in the following order: udanevaala spacketi daanav pastafaari dharm kaa ishwar he
 It was created in 2005 to protest the teaching of Intelligent Design and Creationism in US government schools
 iske madhyam se ye darshaya jaataa he ki darshanashastriy saboot kaa boj us vyakti par he jo vaigyanik drushti se jhoothaya na ja sakane vaala daawa kar rahaa ho, bajaay us vyakti ke jo us daawey ko asweekaar kar rahaa ho
 Although the followers of this religion call it a real religion, in the media it is seen as a satirical religion
 udanevaale spagetti daanav kaa pehla varnan 2005 main bobi henderson dwaara america ke kensas rajya ke shiksha board ko likhi gai ek vyangapurn chitthee main miltaa he
 With this letter, he was opposing the board's permission to teach intelligent design instead of evolution in science classes
 chitthee main ve spacketi or metbal kii tarah dikhne vaale devtaa or brahmand ke srujankarta main apni aasthaa jataa kar crieshnism kaa vyangy karte hai
 They argue that their assumptions are just as valid as the assumptions of intelligent design, and say that their assumptions should therefore have equal time with evolution and intelligent design in science classes
 apni lokapriyata or pahunch ke kaaran udanevaale spacketi daanav ko aksar rasal kii chaaydani ke samakaleen roopaantar kii tarah prayog kiya jaataa he
 Through this, it is shown that the burden of philosophical proof is on the person who is making a scientifically unjustifiable claim, rather than the person who is rejecting that claim
 haalanki henderson ne kaha he ki "pastafaari dharm main ek hi dharm manyata kii anumati he – dharm manyataon kii naamanzoori", phir bhi pastafaari log kuch manyataayen rakhte hai
 According to the Pastafari creation myth, an invisible and inexplicable flying Spaghetti demon created the universe ten thousand years ago after drinking too much alcohol
 in manyataon ke anusaar prithvi ke trutipurna hone kaa kaaran is daanav kaa srijan ke dauraan nashe main chur hona he
 Pastafari also believes that all evidence of evolution was kept by the flying Spaghetti demon himself to test the reverence of the pastors
 jab radiocarbon dating jaise vaigyanik maap liye jate hai, tab udanevaala spagetti daanav aankado ko badal detaa he taaki vaigyanik samajhen ki prithvi arabon varsh puraani he
 The paradise concept of pastoralism includes a beer volcano and a factory producing nude dancers
 
 Pasta Hell is similar, but beer is rancid and dancers have sexually transmitted diseases
 pastafaari manyataon ke anusaar samudri lutere vaastaviktaa main divya praani or mul pastafaari hai
 Pastafari believes that the notion of pirates being "thieves and ostracized" is the result of false information being spread by Christian theologians in the medieval period and today by the International Union of Krishna Consciousness
 inke anusaar, vaastaviktaa main samudri lutere "shanti-priy khoj yatri or sadbhaav ke prasarak" the jo bacchon ko mithaiyaan baantate the
 They say that today's pirates have nothing to do with "ancient lively pirates"
 iske atirikt, bermuda tribhuj se samudri or hawaii jahaajon ke rahasypurna dhang se gaayab hone ke liye pastafaari samudri luteron ke bhuton ko zimmedaar maanate hai
 Pastafari celebrates "international Day of Speak Like Pirates" on 19 September every year

 manusmriti or mahabharat donon main kosh, sena, astr, shilpi, brahman, vaahan, trin, jalashay ann ityadi kaa durg ke bheetar rahanaa aavashyak kaha gaya he
 In Agnipuran, Kalkipuran, etc
, the above mentioned six differences of fortifications have been mentioned
 puratathvik utkhanan se mohenjodaro, hadappa, rupad aadi pura-aitihaasik nagaron ke jo avshesh prakaash main aae hai unase gyaat hota hai ki un dinon nagaron ke do khand hote the; ek khand unche prachiron se ghira hota tha
 The oldest remains of the fort of historical period have been found in the Rajgriha as a rampart made of stones
 patliputra ke kile ke jo kuch thode se chihn mili hai, unase aisa jaan padataa hai ki prachiron ke nirmaan main lakdi kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 The Yavana ambassador named Megasthenes who came in the Mauryan period has given a detailed description of this fort
 usne likhaa he ki patliputra nagar nau mile lanbaa or lagbhag do mile chaudaa he jo chaaron ore 600 haath chaudee or 30 haath gahari khaanin se ghira he
 a strong wooden wall is built around it, with 500 bastions and 64 strong gates
 kaushambi ke utkhanan main kile kii diwaar ke jo anshprakash main aae hai, ve pakki iton se jade hue hai
 In the excavation of Rajghat, parts of the concrete ramparts of raw clay on the banks of the Ganges came to light
 kintu in sabase pracheen kilon kaa purna swaroop saamne nahin aata
 In Eran, which was a famous city during the Gupta period, the remains of the fort have been found far enough
 unke adhyayan se gyaat hota he ki us nagar ko is prakaar basaaya gaya tha ki nadiyaan khain kaa kaam den
 On three sides it was surrounded by the Veena river, on the fourth side there were two other small rivers, which flowed in the western part of the city and on the fourth side the river Veena
 nadiyon dwaara bane is prakritik khai ke bheetar durg kaa pracheer tha jo kadachit ekadam khadi deevaaron se bana tha or unamem unchi gol burjiyaan rahi hogi
 According to Kautilya's Arthashastra, collection of small forts, larger than them is described as Dronmukh and two of the largest forts - someshvararachit mansollas main durgon ke nimnlikhit 8 prakaar bataaye gayi hai- The nine types of fortifications are given in Samrajyalakshmipeethika
 shilpashaastra ke anya granthon main inkaa vistrut rup main nimnlikhit samoohon main vibhaajan kiya gaya he- In relation to the medieval forts of India, things are known in more detail
 saamanyat: kilon kii deevaaren badi chaudee tathaa unchi banaai jaati thim jinamein bich main unchi burje tathaa vishaal phatak hote the
 Forts built on small hills of this period are found in large numbers
 rajasthan tathaa dakshini bharat ke kile praaia: pahadiyon par hi banaae gaye hai or kuch kile milon kii paridhi main bane hai, jo kile pahadiyon par bane hai unamem dohari-tihari chaharadivaariyaan hai
 The main fortification was inside the highest boundary wall
 praaia: kilon kii paridhi main nagar tathaa mukhya durg donon hi rahete the
 There was a high hill or river bank on one side of the main fort
 durganirmaan karaate samay un margon kii raksha par vishesh dhyaan diya jaataa tha jinase hokar shatru kile main aa sakate the yaa akraman kar sakate the
 Normally a high hill was chosen for the construction of the fort, which was difficult to reach on the sloping rocks
 jis ore se shatru ke chadh aane kii ashanka hoti thi us ore kii chattaanon ko katkar aisa dhalwaan maarg bana diya jaataa tha jisase ek hi diwaar dwaara uski raksha ho jaati thi or duusari pahari bilkul sidhi or khadi hoti thi
 At some places, four to seven fortified gates were built in these sloping routes
 kilon kii bahari diwaar samtal bhoomi par banaai jaati thim, jisko chaudee or gahari diwaar kii raksha khaaiyon dwaara surakshit kiya jaataa tha
 If the fort were situated on the banks of the river, then on one side, the river would protect it and the rest ate more
 khaaiyaan uthvaan pul dwaara paar kii jaati thi, jaisaa agre ke kile main he
 If the fort was on a hill, then its outer walls would be protected in the same way as in Jinji and Golconda
 daulatabad ke mukhya kile ke pravesh dwaar kii raksha gahari khaaiyon dwaara kii jaati thi jinamein sadaiv pani bharaa rahata tha
 In Bidar, deep water trenches were built around the city in addition to the trenches

 dilli ke puraane kile main jharokhon kii teen or tughluqabad main chaar panktiyaan hai

 bijapur, fatahpur sikri tathaa agra jaise kuch kilon main jharokhon ke bahari bhaag main goli chalaane ke liye sainikon raksha ke hetu pathar kii chhatariyaan bani hui hai
 In terms of perseverance, there are variations in the gates of the fort too, although they were often made large, heavy and strong
 kuch kilon main teen-teen phatakon kii vyavastha kii gai he jinke madhya aangan bhi hai, jaise zinji tathaa daulatabad main
 The outer gate of the three gates in the fort of Daulatabad has two gates, one at the entrance and the other opening into the courtyard and the space between these two becomes an archway
 kilon ke daravaaje baari tathaa drudh lakdi ke banaae jate the jo 6 inch tak mote hote the

 a window was also placed on one side of the door, which was 3 feet wide and 4 feet high in size
 is khidki main bhi nukili mekhen thonk di jaati thim
 After closing the door, a heavy pestle was given from this side to that side so that the gates could not move at all
 bijapur ke kile ke shahpur dwaar main tathaa ahmednagar ke kile main bhi yahi vyavastha thi
 At the time of the blockage of the fort, a heavy chain was put in front of the door to this end
 durgon main jal tathaa khaadya saamagree kaa paryaapt prabandh hota tha
 Large cisterns were also made by cutting of solid rocks so that water collected during the rainy season and the inhabitants of the fort had no shortage of water at the time of invasion

 Forts were built in ancient Greece and Rome too and had their own importance, but the history of forts in Europe begins from the Middle Ages itself

 blitz ek bhartiya samachar-patr tha jiske sampadak roosi karanjia the
 Blitz was a milestone in Indian journalism
 yah bharat kaa pehla aisa akhbaar tha, jise gaanv gaanv main shauk se padhaa jaataa tha
 In many places, the blitz was able to reach very few numbers, then people went to each other's house or shop to fulfill the desire to read the blitz
 aaj kii tivi patrakarita ke daur main jahaan koi bhi braking news na to sansani machaa paati he na vishwasaneeyata paidaa kar paati he, jabaki blitz kaa daur aisa daur tha ki iskaa ek ek shabd vishwasaneeyata, pramanikta or khoji patrakarita kaa aisa maanak hota tha ki blitz main chhapi khabar satta ke sheersh, singhaasana ko bhi hilaa detii thi
 The publication of the English 'blitz' began during the Second World War from 2 February 1941, when there was a non-aggression friendship treaty between Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany
 duniya ke sheersh kootneetijna or jasoos jab yah kalpana bhi nahin kar sakate the, us samay sabase pehle `blissj' ne yah sansanikhej bhavishyavaanee kar di thi ki hitler ne apane `panjar divijan' ko rus par hamalaa karne kii taiyaari karne kaa aadesh de diya he
 Similarly, the first 'blitz' printed that 'azad Hind Fauj' has been established and its commander Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose has raised Andaman Island from British slavery and hoisted the tricolor flag there
 san 'saath ke barason main desh main jagah-jagah se saikadon tabloid vibhinn bhashaaon main `blissj' kii orj par chap rahe the, magar ve `blissj' nahin the
 It was only a measure of the popularity of Russian Karanjia's journalism that in the collision of big newspapers, the 'blitz' became the leader and model of a parallel journalism of resistance
 vah bhartiyata, dharmanirpekshata or nari-sammaan kaa prabal samarthak tha
 All this was due to the Parsi rites of Karanjia
 yudhkaal main waar-corespondate rahe karanjia or `blissj' ne bartaanvi faujee afasaron kii ayyashi ke liye jo sharmnaak `vimens oijiliri kor ' gathit kii gayi thi usko band karaane ke liye jabardast muhim chhedi or tatkaalik british shashan ko use band karne par majaboor kar diya tha
 When Hindi Blitz was included in the English 'blitz' family which has been established as parallel journalism, it proved to be a transformative contributor to the Hindi language and linguistic expression
 hindi `blissj' kii ``saral, subodh or sahi hindi ne us samay ke lagbhag sabhi hindi akhabaaron or patr-patrikaon kii ``clisht bhashaa or uljhi hui style ko prabhavit kiya
 The Hindi 'blitz' did not remain confined until the boundary of the translated version of English
 hindi main apana ek swatantra vyaktitv gadhane kii taab hindi sanskaran ke pratham sampadak munish narayan saxena or nandakishor nautial jaisi patrkaar team kii vajah se paidaa hui, jiskaa shrey roosi karanjia ko bhi dena hoga, kyonki unhone hindi `blissj' ko purna sampadakeey swatantraaa de rakhi thi
 In the sixties, hundreds of tabloids were printed in different languages on the lines of 'blitz' in the country, but they were not 'blitz'
 yah roosi karanjia kii patrakarita kii lokapriyata kaa hi ek paimaana tha ki bade akhabaaron kii takkar main `blissj' pratirodh kii ek samanaantar patrakarita kaa netaa or adarsh ban gaya tha
 He was a strong supporter of Indianness, secularism and women-respect
 yah sab karanjia ke parsi sanskaron ke kaaran tha
 Karanjia and the 'blitz', who were war-correspondents during the war, waged a massive campaign to shut down the shameful 'women's Augmentation Corps' which was formed for the Ayyashi of the British military officers and forced the immediate British rule to close it

 `` Free, Frank and Fearless was his motto
 rashtriya ghatnakram ho yaa antarrashtriya, uski bhanak roosi karanjia ko pehle hi lag jaati thi
 Karanjia had an unmatched ability to correctly identify the public's pulse, owing to the information system of the 'blitz', which was present everywhere from the grassroots to the top
 `blissj' 1942 ke `angarejo, bharat chodo' andolan main `kangres samaajawaadee underground' kaa mukhpatr ban gaya tha
 Jayaprakash Narayan, Acharya Narendra Dev, Ram Manohar Lohia, Aruna, Ashok Mehta, patwardhan-bandhu, Meenu Masani all wrote and printed under the pseudonym 'tipu' in the socialist leader 'blitz'
