 mantriyon kii teen shreniyan hai, jo rank ke avarohi kram is prakaar hai - Jain literature is very vast
 adhikansh main vah dharmik sahitya hi he
 This literature has been written in Sanskrit, Prakrit and Apabhramsa languages
 mahavir kii pravritiyon kaa centre magadh rahaa he, isaliye unhone yahan kii lokbhasha ardhamagadhi main apana upadesh diya jo uplabdh jain aagmon main surakshit he
 These are 45 and consider Shwetambara Jain evidence, not Digambara Jain
 dingbaron ke anusaar aagam sahitya kaaldosh se vicchhinn ho gaya he
 Digambara accepts the hetkhandagam which has been considered part of the 12th Anglicism
 digambaron ke pracheen sahitya kii bhashaa shauraseni he
 Later, Jain pundits enriched the language literature by writing their compositions in the later folk-languages of Apabhransh and Apabhransh
 adikalin sahitya main jain sahitya ke granth sarvaadhik sankhya main or sabase pramanik rup main milte hai
 Jain creators composed a variety of texts like Purana poetry, Charit poetry, Katha poetry, Ras poetry
 swayambhu, pushp danta, hemchandra, somprabh suri aadi mukhya jain kavi hai
 He also made the folk tales prevalent among Hindus the subject of his creations and showed his culmination to be different from tradition
 jain-sahitya kaa pracheenatam bhaag ‘aagam’ ke naam se kaha jaataa he
 These proceeds are 46- aagam granth kaaphi pracheen he, tathaa jo sthaan vaidic sahitya kshetra main veda kaa or buddha sahitya main tripitak kaa he, vahi sthaan jain sahitya main aagmon kaa he
 In the Agam texts, there is a compilation of many stories and stories related to the teachings of Mahavira and Jain culture
 jain parampara ke anusaar mahavir nirvana ke 160 varsh pashchaat magadh deshon main bahut baari dushkaal padaa, jiske falswaroop jain bhikshuon ko anyatra vihaar karnaa padaa
 At the end of the period, Shramana gathered in Pataliputra and eleven organs were compiled piece by piece, the twelfth organ was not remembered, so it could not be compiled
 is sammelan ko 'patliputra-vaachana' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 After some time, when the Agama literature began to be severed again, the second conference of Jain monks took place after 827 or 840 years of Mahavir Nirvana
 ek aryaskandil kii adhyakshata main mathura main tathaa doosraa nagarjun suri kii adhyakshata main valbhi main
 The conference at Mathura has been called 'mathuri-vachana'
 tatpashchaat lagbhag 150 varsh baad, mahavir nirvana ke 980 yaa 993 varsh baad valbhi main devardhigani kshamashraman kii adhyakshata main saadhuon kaa chauthaa sammelan hua, jisamen suvyavasthit rup se aagmon kaa antim baar sankalan kiya gaya
 It is called by the name of 'valabhi-vachana'
 vartmaan aagam isi sankalana kaa rup he
 The history of the above three conferences of the Jain Agama shows that Agama literature suffered from time to time, and this literature in its original form could not remain secure
 yahi kaaran maaloom hota he ki baudhon ke vipul sahitya ke mukaable yah sahitya bahut nune he, tathaa is sahitya main vikaar aa jane se hi sambhavtah digambar sampradaay ne ise maananaa asweekaar kar diya
 This literature depicting the economic and social condition of India from the fourth century BC to the fifth century CE is of importance in many respects
 ayaarang, sooyagdan, uttarajaiyan, dasveyali aadi granthon main jo jain bhikshuon ke aachaar-vichaaron kaa vistrut varnan he, vah baudhon ke dhammapad, suttanipat tathaa mahabharat aadi granthon se bahut anshon main mail khaataa he, or dow
 vinternij aadi vidwaanon ke kathananusaar vah shraman-kavy kaa pratik he
 In terms of language and subject etc
, this part of Jain proceeds seems to be the oldest
 bhagwati kalpasutra, ovaiy, thanang, niryavali aadi granthon main shraman bhagavan mahavir, unki charya, unke upadeshon tathaa tatkaaleen raja, rajkumaar or unke yuddh aadi kaa vistrut varnan he, jisase jain itihaas kii luptpraaya anek anushrutiyon kaa pataa lagata he
 Nayadhammakha, Uvasagadasa, Antagadadasa, Anuttarovvaiyadsa, Vivagasuya, etc
, have many stories and stories told by Mahavira and his disciples, in which many things related to Jain tradition are introduced
 rypanesi, jeevabhigam, pannavna aadi granthon main vaastushastra, sangeet, vanaspati aadi sambandhi anek mahatvapurn vishyon kaa varnan he jo praayah anyatra uplabdh nahin hota he
 Aanthasutras have a detailed description of the dieting and atonement etc
 of the sages, which can be compared with the Vinayapitaka of Buddhists
 vrihatkalpasutra main bataaya gaya he ki jab mahavir saket subhumibhag naamak udyaan main vihaar karte the to us samay unhone apane bhikshu-bhikshuniyon ko saket ke purv main ang-magadh tak dakshai ke kaushambi tak, tathaa uttar main kunala tak vihaar karne kii anumati di
 This shows that initially the propagation of Jainism was limited, and Jain Shramans could not go elsewhere except Magadha and parts of Uttar Pradesh
 nissandeh chhedsutron kaa yah bhaag utana hi pracheen he jitne swayan mahavir
 Subsequently, Jain inscriptions of Mathura, contemporary to King Kanishka, mention different ganas, clans and branches, they often coincide with the ganas, clans and branches mentioned in the Kalpasutra of Bhadarwahu
 isse bhi jain aagam granthon kii pramanikta kaa pataa chalata he
 In fact, till this time, the difference between Shwetambar and Digambar is not known in Jain tradition
 jain aagmon ke vishay, bhashaa aadi main jo pali tripitak se samanta he, vah bhi is sahitya kii pracheenta ko dyotit karti he
 Like the fables of Pali Sutras, several commentaries, commentaries, Deepika, retirement, description, Avachoori etc
 have also been written
 is sahitya ko saamanyata niryukti, bhashya, churni or tikaa-in chaar vibhaagon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he, aagam ko milakar ise 'paanchangi' ke naam se kehete hai
 Like Agama literature, this literature is also of great importance
 isamen aagmon ke vishay kaa vistaar se pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 There are many recommendations in this literature, which are historically very important
 vrihatkalpbhaashya, vyavahaarabhashya, nishithchurni, aavashyakchurni, aavashyaktikaa, uttaradhyayan tikaa aadi tikaa-granthon main puraatatv sambandhi vividh saamagree bhari padi he, jisase bharat ke reeti-rivaaj, meley tyohaar, sadhu-sampradaay, dushkaal, baadh, chor-lutere, saarthwah, vyapaar ke maarg, shilp, kala, bhojan-shaastra, makaan, aabhushan, aadi vividh vishyon par bahut prakaash padataa he
 This literature is also very important in terms of folklore and philology

 On this book, he himself wrote Adult Manorama Tika

 He composed the mini-theory of Kaumudi

 Siddhantakomudi is more popular than Ashtadhyayi
 ashtaadhi ke sutron kaa kramparivartan karte hue upyukt sheershakon ke antargat ekatra kiya gaya he or unki vyakhya kii gayi he
 Thus Siddhantakomudi is more systematic and can be understood easily
 siddhantakoumudi bahut bada granth he, sanskrit bhashaa kaa vyakaran isamen purna rup se aa gaya he
 There are many episodes in it, such as- sabhi pratisutron kii vyakhya kii gayi he, jaise- The Siddhantakoumudi is the main text which propagates the fame of Bhattojidixit
 yah ‘shabd kaustubh’ ke pashchaat likhaa gaya tha
 Bhattojidixit himself has written a commentary on it titled Adultumanrama
 siddhanth-kaumudi ko prakriya-paddati kaa sarvottam granth samajha jaataa he
 Earlier processions which were written in the book did not include all the sources of Ashtadhyayi
 bhattozidikshit ne siddhantakoumudi main ashtaadhi ke sabhi sutron ko vividh prakarnon main vyavasthit kiya he, isi ke antargat samast dhaatuon ke roopon kaa vivaran de diya he tathaa loukik sanskrit ke vyakaran kaa vishleshan karke vaidic-prakriya evam swar-prakriya ko ant main rakh diya he
 Bhattojidixit has attempted to present the all-round form of Paniniya grammar according to the procedure, while reviewing the Sutra chronological interpretations of Kashika, Nyas and Padam Zari, etc
 and the views of Karkumudi and its commentaries
 unhone aavashyaktaanusaar paribhaashaon, vaarttikon tathaa bhashyeshtiyon kaa bhi ullekh kiya he
 He has shown the harmony of the conscience of the monks and has established some self-opinion on the basis of the Mahabhashya
 saath hi prasiddh kaviyon dwaara prayukt kinhin vivaadaaspad prayogon kii sadhuta par bhi vichaar kiya he
 In the medieval era, Siddhantakamudi was so much publicized and spread that the ancient methods of Panini grammar and the grammatical methods like Mugdbodh were dissolved
 kaalaantar main prakriya-paddati tathaa siddhantakoumudi ke dosha kii ore bhi vidwaanon kii drushti gai kintu ve ise na chhod sake
 Bhattajidishtha occupies an important place in Paninian grammar
 panini-vyakaran par unka aisa anoothaa prabhaav padaa he ki mahabhashya kaa mahatva bhi bhula diya gaya he
 It is beginning to be understood that Siddhantakomudi is not only the door to the great language, but is a brief but vivid essence of the great language

 homeopathy chikitsakon kii dharna he ki prayek jivit praani hamen indriyon ke kriyasheel adarsh ko banaae rakhane kii pravriti hoti he aure jab yah kriyasheel adarsh vikrut hota he, tab praani main is adarsh ko praapt karne ke liye anek pratikriyaayein hoti hai
 The creature is only assisted in its efforts by medicine
 aushadhi alp maatra main deni chahie, kyonki beemaari main rogi atisanvegi hota he
 a small amount of the drug is effective, so that only one effect appears and there are no side effects
 rugnavastha main utakon kii roopantarit sangraahakta ke kaaran yah ekavastha prabhaav swasthya ke pun: sthaapan main viniyamit ho jaataa he
 Scholars consider homeopathy as pseudoscience
 da haniman dwaara pravartit homeopathy kaa mul siddhant he - "similia simivibas curenter" arthath rog unheen aushadhiyon se niraapad rup se, shighratisheeghra or atyant prabhaavshaalee rup se nirog hote hai, jo rogi ke rogalakshanon se milte-julate lakshan utpann karne main sakasham hai
 In other words, according to this rule, the small amount of the same drug, which creates a disorder in a healthy body, also destroys the natural symptoms of such symptoms
 udhaaharan ke liye kachche pyaaj kaatane par zukam ke jo lakshan ubharate hai jaise naak, aankh se pani nikalnaa usee prakaar ke zukam ke sthiti main homeopathic aushadhi alium sipa dene se thik bhi ho jaataa he
 In homeopathy, patients are instructed to give only one medicine at a time
 hanemaan ne anubhav ke aadhaar par ek baar main keval ek aushadhi kaa vidhaan nishchit kiya tha, kintu ab is mat main bhi paryaapt parivartan ho gaya he
 Some of the modern practitioners are following the path suggested by Hanaman and some have decided their own path and use two, three medicines at a time
 sadrush vigyaan ke aadhaar par rogi kii chayan kii gai aushadhi kii maatra ati nayun honi chaiye taaki dawa ke dushprinaam na dikhen
 Firstly, it acts as a component in the success of the body's resistance
 homeopathic aushadhi ko vishesh rup se taiyaar kiya jaataa he jise aushadhi shaktikaran kaa naam diya jaataa he
 These substances are prepared from trituration and liquids with suction system
 yah ek mul prasang he
 It is also true that homeopathy does not cure in the name of diseases
 vastav main yah rog se grasit vyakti ke maansik, bhavatmak tathaa shaareerik aadi sabhi pahaluhein kii chikitsa karti he
 Homeopathy of five asthma patients cannot be treated with a single medicine
 sampurna lakshan ke aadhaar par yah paanch rogiyon main alag-2 aushadhiyaan nirdhaarit kii ja sakati hai
 Hahnemann recognized the biographical power in the human body, and proclaimed that this biographical power protects the body from external invasive diseases
 parantu rogki avasthaa main yah jeevani shakti rog grasit ho jaati he
 The medicine selected on the basis of similar science, destroys this biotic power disorder and frees the body from disease
 haniman ne paaya ki sabhi puraane rogon ke aadharbhoot kaaran sora, psychosis or siphilis hai
 Hahnemann gave them the word Miyaz which means Greek - to pollute
 aushadhi ko chikitsa hetu upyog karne ke liye unki therapuyitak kshamta kaa gyaan hona aavashyak he
 Drug certification is a process in homeopathy in which the basic characteristics of the medicine are used to know the medicine by using it in healthy humans
 in aushadhiyon kaa pramann swasth manushyon par kiya jaataa he or inase hone vaale lakshanein kii jaankaree ke aadhaar par sadrushta vigyaan kii madad se rogon kaa ilaaj kiya jaataa he
 The important aspect of this medical practice is the potency
 prarambh main hanemaan ucch samarthy kii aushadhi prayukt karte the, kintu anubhav se inhone nimnasamarthy kii aushadhi kaa prayog bhi prabhavakaari paaya
 They found that many times, where physical changes or external factors are present in the disease, the drug of low strength works better
 homeopathic aushadhiyon main teen prakaar ke scale prayog kiye jate hai - In this, the process of triturate or succussion is done by mixing one part of the medicine in nine parts of the vehicle
 inase banane vaali aushadhi kii scale ko "x" shabd se janaa jaataa he jaise kaali faas 6x, aconite 3x ityadi
 Mostly, this scale used in solid drugs takes one part of medicine and 9 parts of milk-sugar to make 1x, liquid medicines use one part root and 9 parts alcohol to make 1x
 isse aage 2x ke liye 1x kaa ek bhaag or 9 bhaag dugdh sharkara athwa alcohol kaa lete hai ; aise hi aage kai potency banane ke liye pichhali potency kaa ek bhaag lete huye aage kii power ko badhaate hai
 In this, one part of the medicine is sacrificed with 99 parts of the vehicle
 inaki inase banane vaali aushadhiyon ko dawa kii shakti "c" se janaa jaataa he
 Such as 30c, 200c, 1000c etc
 sakkashan sirf dawa ke mul arq ko alcohol main milaanaa bhar nahin he balki use sakkashan karnaa he
 Nowadays automatic machine is used for succession, whereas in olden times it was to be made by hand by itself
 pehali potency banane ke liye dawa ke mul arq kaa ek hissaa or 99 bhaag alcohol liya jaataa he, isko 10 baar sacshan kar ke pehali potency taiyaar hoti he ; isi tarah duusari potency ke liye pichhali potency kaa ek bhaag or 99 bhaag alcohol ; isi tarah aage kii potency taiyaar kii jaati hai
 One of the main reasons for opposition to homeopathy is the low quantity of homeopathic medicines
 homeopathy davaayen arq, sampeshan tathaa tanutaaon ke rup main hoti he or kuch ether yaa glisreen main dhuli hoti hai, jaise sarpavish
 The extracts are mainly derived from the animal and vegetable world
 inhen vishisht ras, mul arq yaa matics tinchar kehete hai or inkaa pratik greek akshar 'theta' he
 The methods for preparing different strengths from matrix tinctures and transmissions are the same
 tanutaaon main bhinn-bhinn samarthy kii aushadhiyaan taiyaar kii jaati hai
 After starting from Moolark, as we grow in the scale of Tanuta, as we move away from the raw material, this is why the medicines made by the homeopathy method are generally toxic and harmless
 in aushadhiyon main ascharyajanak prabhaavshaalee aushadhiy gun hota he

 gandhak, paara, sankhiya, jasta, tin, barita, sona, chaandi, loha, chuunaa, tanba, tathaa telurium ityadi tatwon tathaa anya bahut se padaarthon se aushadhiyaan banaai gai hai
 Drugs are also made from the compounds of the elements
 homeopathy aushadhvivarani main 260 se 270 tak aushadhiyon kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 Most of these have been tested on healthy males, females or children to determine their pathogenic properties
 shesh dawaaon ko vivarani main anubhavsiddh hone ke naate sthaan diya gaya he
