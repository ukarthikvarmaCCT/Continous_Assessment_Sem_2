 To deal with the socialists, Bismarck passed a very stringent Act in 1878 prohibiting the gathering of socialists
 unke pramukh netaaon ko jail main daal diya gaya
 Newspapers and literature were strictly banned
 in damankaaree upayon ke saath-saath bismark ne mazdooron ko samaajwaadiyon se dur karne ke liye "rajya-samaajwaad" kaa prayog karnaa shuru kiya
 Under this, he showed to the workers that the state itself is striving for the welfare of the workers
 usanke mazdooron kii bhalaai ke liye anek beemaa yojanaayen, pension yojanaayen lagu kii
 Working hours of women and children were fixed
 bismark kaa yah 'rajya samaajwaad' vaastavik samaajwaad nahin tha, kyonki vah janatantr kaa virdohi tha or poonjeevaad kaa samarthan tha
 Bismarck patronized German industries for industrial advancement, which increased industries and production
 taiyaar maal ko bechney ke liye nai mandiyon kii aavashyaktaa thi
 This need prompted Bismarck's adoption of colonial policy
 faltah 1884 i
 main bismark ne africa ke purvi ore dakshini-pashchimi bhaagon main anek vyapaarik chaukiyon kii sthapana kii or teen samraaton ke sangh se baahar ho gaya
 He said that Bismarck lost a friend by favoring one friend
 bismark ke liye austria kii mitrataa zyada laabhadaayak thi kyonki austria ke madhya sandhi hone kii sthiti main germany kaa prabhaav zyada rahata atah 1879 main ek dwigut sandhi hui
 5 Russia's disappearance from Germany became a matter of concern for Bismarck
 use laga ki kahin rus france ke saath koi maitri sandhi na kar le
 Therefore, he immediately tried to improve relations with Russia
 1881 main use safalataa bhi mili
 Now there was a treaty between Germany, Russia and Austria
 5 ab bismark ne italy kii ore dhyaan diya or italy se sandhi kar france ko europea raajnneeti main bilkul alag kar dena chaha
 At the same time, both France and Italy were keen on seizing Tunis in Africa
 bismark ne france ko tunis par adhikaar karne ke liye protsaahit kiya taaki france main germany ke paksh main sadbhaavna fail jaae or france samrajyavad main ulajhaa jaae, jisase germany se badla lene kii baat dur ho jaae
 France took over Tunis in 1881, which angered Italy
 italy kii naaraazgi kaa laabh uthaakar bismark ne 1882 main italy, germany or austria ke bich trigut sandhi ko anjaam diya
 Bismarck gave birth to a new 'treaty system'
 sandhi kar usne vibhinn guton kaa nirmaan kiya
 The feature of this treaty system was that generally all the treaties that have happened in history took place during the war
 kintu bismark ne shaantikaal main sandhi pranali ko janm dekar ek naveen drushtikon saamne rakhaa
 Union of the Three Emperors: Bismarck was the first step under the treaty system in the field of foreign policy
 1872 main teen samraaton ke sangh kaa nirmaan kiya isamen austria kaa samraat francis joseph, rus kaa jaar dwitiya tathaa germany kaa samraat willian pratham shaamil tha
 Although it was not a written treaty between these three countries, some things were agreed upon
 ve is baat par sahamat hue the ki europe main shaanti banaae rakhane tathaa samaajawaadee aandolan se nipatane ke liye ve ek-duusare ke saath sahyog evam vichaar vinimay karte rahe
 This treaty was Bismarck's great diplomatic victory, because on the one hand he befriended the defeated power of Sedova, Austria and on the other hand, ended the possibility of friendship of Austria and Russia for France
 kintu kuch samay pashchaat yah sangh tut gaya kyonki balcon kshetra main rus or austria ke hit aapas takaraate the
 Therefore, Bismarck had to choose between Russia and Austria
 1878 kii berlin kii sandhi main bismark ko rus or austria main se kisi ek ko chunanaa tha, jisamen usne austria kaa paksh liya
 As a result, Russia became angry with him
 dharmik muddon se nitapane or rajya ko sarvopari banane ke liye bismark ne carch ke viruddh kai kanoon paas kiye
 In 1872, the Jesuits were boycotted and Prasha and the Pope broke up
 1873 main paarit kanoon ke anusaar vivaah rajya nyaayalayon kii ajna se hone laga jisamen carch kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin rah gayi
 The state got the authority over the educational institutions and the government assistance to the church was discontinued
 in kanoonon ke baavjood bhi catholic jhuke nahin
 Therefore, Bismarck considered the challenges of the Socialists more dangerous and compromised with the Catholics
 iske tahat catholic ke viruddh kanoon radd kar die gaye or pope se raajnneetik sambandh sthapit kiya
 After the reunification of Germany, the main objective of Bismarck's foreign policy in 1871 was to maintain Germany's dominance in Europe
 niti nirdhaaran ke taur par usne ghoshit kiya ki germany tusht rajya he or kshetreey vistaar main isaki koi ruchi nahin he
 Bismarck was most feared by France because he had obtained the territory of elsse-laurent from France, which made France very dissatisfied
 bismark ko vishwaas tha ki francisi apni 1870-71 kii paraajay or alses-lauren kshetra ko nahin bhuulenge
 Therefore, the main objective of his foreign policy was to keep France friendless in Europe so that it would not be in a position to fight Germany
 is tarah bismark kii videsh niti ke aadharbhoot siddhanth the- vyaavhaarik avasarwaadi kootneeti kaa prayog kar german virdohi shaktiyon ko alag-thalag rakhana evam france ko mitra viheen bananaa, udaarvaad kaa virodh evam sanyavad main aasthaa rakhana
 His treaty system gave rise to rivalries
 faltah europe main tanaavpurn vaataavaran ban gaya or is prakaar europe pratham vishwayuddh ke kagaar par pahunch gaya
 Bismarck's foreign policy encouraged militarization and armament in Europe
 is niti ne europe ko pratham vishwayuddh kii dahalij tak pahunchaa diya
 Bismarck signed all treaties with conflicting nations
 unke bich samanvay banaae rakhana atyant dushkar kaary tha, jise keval bismark jaisaa kootneetijna hi kar saktaa tha
 Therefore, after the resignation of the post in 1890, this method became fatal and groups like France, Russia etc
 were formed against Germany
 is prakaar bismark kii videsh niti ne prakarantar se pratham vishwayuddh kii prishthbhumi kaa nirmaan kar diya
 Bismarck's policy of factionalism led to the formation of a second bloc against Germany and eventually Europe was divided into two armed and powerful factions
 jisaki charam parinti pratham vishwayuddh main dikhaai padi
 In 1887, Bismarck signed a resettlement treaty with Russia, under which the two pledged to support each other
 yah sandhi gupt rakhi gai thi
 This was Bismarck's diplomatic victory as Germany simultaneously enjoyed the friendship of Russia and Austria
 bismark ne britain ke saath maitreepurn sambandh banane kaa praytn kiya
 Bismarck believed that Britain was a naval power and would not be hostile to any nation until its navy was challenged
 atah britain ko khush karne liye bismark ne german nausena ko badhaane ko koi kadam nahin uthaaya
 To please Britain, he declared that Germany was not an imperialist country
 duusari taraf england kii france ke saath aupniveshik pratidwandita thi jiskaa laabh uthaakar bismark ne britain ke saath madhur sambandh banaae

 According to various theories, the basic needs may be at the core of reducing physical pain and maximizing pleasure, or may include special needs such as food and rest; Or an embodied object, hobby, goal, condition of existence, ideal, may be included, or it may also be attributed to avoidance of lesser causes such as altruism, morality, or mortality

 Social psychological research suggests that extrinsic rewards may lead to over-justification as well as a decrease in intrinsic motivation
 bahya protsaahan kabhi-kabhi abhiprerana ko kamjor kar sakate hai
 a classic study by Greene and Lepper shows that children who were rewarded for their painting with freehand felt-tip pens later used to play with the pens again or used to paint the pens Showed little interest in

 Any deficiencies in basic motivation; For example, the hunger that drives a person to seek food, while the more subtle motivations lead to appreciation and approval, which can lead one to behave in a way that makes the other Be happy iske vipareet, bahya puraskaar kii bhoomika or uddipana ko pashuon main bhi dekha jaataa he
 When training animals, when they correctly understand a move and perform that task, they can be seen as an example in their hospitality by feeding and feeding them well

 There are many innate motivation theories
 sahaj prerana-katautee siddhant is avadharana se panpa he ki hamaari kuch khaas jaivik sahaj prerana hoti hai, jaise ki bhukh
 agar ise santusht nahin kiya jaataa, samay ke guzarane ke saath sahaj prerakashkti main vruddhi hoti jaati he
 If the persuasion is satisfied, its strength decreases
 yah siddhant vichaaron kii pratikriya niyantran pranali jaise ooshmaasthaitik ke frid ke siddhanton ke vividh vichaaron par aadhaarit he
 There are some intuitive or public validity theories of persuasion
 udhaaharan ke liye jab bhojan pakaaya ja rahaa hota he to bhojan taiyaar ho jane tak bhukh ke badhane ke saath taal mila kar sahaj prerakashkti pratimaan bhi upasthit hota he or khaanaa kha lene ke baad manogat bhukh main kami aa jaati he
 There are a number of problems, however, that leave the validity of the instinctive deduction open to debate
 pehali samasya yah he ki yah isaki vyakhya nahin karata ki gaun samblitkaarak sahaj prerana ko kaise kam karte he
 For example, money does not fulfill biological or psychological needs, but the salary reduces the sedentary through second-order situation
 duusare, ek sahaj prerana, jaise ki bhukh, ko khaanaa khaane kii ek "ichha" ke rup main dekha jaataa he, jo sahaj prerana ko ek homuncular swabhaav banaata he - ek aisa lakshan jisaki aalochana 'chote aadmi' kii buniyadi samasya or uski ichchhaaon ko sahaj hi hridayadravi bataakar kii jaati he
 Furthermore, it is clear that instinctive motivation deduction theory cannot be a completely conduct theory, or a hungry person cannot cook food without eating it before completing cooking
 The ability of innate motivation theory to deal with all types of behavior, not by proving instinctive motivation, or by imposing additional persuasion for "tasty" food, which combines cooking and tasting with innate motivations for "food"

 This principle is sometimes called the "motivational-hygiene principle"
 soochna pranali or upyogkarta kii santushti se sambandhit adhyayan jaise vyavsaayik kshetron main harmberg siddhant kaa upyog paaya jaataa he
 Clayton Alderfer established the ERG principle by expanding Maslov's hierarchy of needs
 sharirak or suraksha sambandhi zaruraton, jo ki nichle kram kii jaruratein he, ko astitv kii shrenee main rakhaa jaataa hai; jabaki prem or atmasamman sambandhi zaruraton ko sambhddhata kii shrenee main rakhaa jaataa he
 Our self-articulation and self-esteem needs are contained in the development category
 edward desi or richard rayaan dwaara viksit aatm-sankalp ke siddhant main maanav vyavhaar kii prerakashkti ke rup main aantarik prerana ke mahatv par prakaash daalaa gaya he
 Like the hierarchical theory of Maslov and others built on this basis, SDT recognizes the natural tendency for growth and development

 The achievement motivation lists are based on this principle and three factors are relevant to the assessment of business and professional success
 lakshya siddhant is dharna par aadhaarit he ki kabhi-kabhi ek spasht rup se paribhaashit ant tak pahunchane ke liye logon ke paas ek prerakashkti hoti he
 Often, this end is a reward in itself

 ek adarsh lakshya ko ek aisi sthiti banani chahie, jahaan vyavhaar ke pravartan or ant ke bich kaa samay sameep ho

 Most children do not know how much effort they need to make to reach that goal
 duglas vermiren ne is par vyapak shodh kiya he ki anek log apane lakshyon ko paane main kyon vifal ho jate hai
 The factors directly attributed to the failure have been attributed
 vermiren ne kaha he ki jab tak ek vyakti spasht rup se apane prerit kaarak yaa unke mahatvapurn or sarthak kaarnon kii pahchaan nahin kar letaa, vah bhala kyon lakshya praapt karnaa chahega, unamem kabhi bhi ise praapt karne kii shakti nahin hogi
 Social-cognitive models of behavior change include the creation of motivation and willpower
 prerana ko ek prakriya ke rup main dekha jaataa he jo vyavhaar ke iraadon ke nirmaan kii aguwai karata he
 Willpower is seen as a process that serves to drive intention toward actual behavior
 duusare shabdon main, prerana or ichhashakti kramshah lakshya sthapit karne or lakshya hasil karne ke sandarbh main dekhe jate hai
 Both processes require self-regulatory efforts
 anek aatm-niamak rachanaaon ko lakshya praapt karne ke liye vrundavadan main kaam karne kii jarurat hoti he
 Understanding self-virtue or self-strength is an example of motivational and willful creation
 vyavhaar ke iraadon, kaary yojanaon ke vikaas or karrwai kii ichhashakti ke vikaas ke nirmaan ko aatmbal sahaj banaata he
 This can help to turn intention into action
 kuch manovaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki maanav vyavhaar kaa ek mahatvapurn hissaa achetan abhiprerana se urjaakrit or nirdeshit hota he
 According to Maslov, "psychoanalysis has often shown that the basis for the relationship between a conscious desire and the ultimate unconscious goal need not be obvious
" In other words, the stated motivation does not always match the estimate made by skilled observers
 For example, it is possible that a person is accident-prone, because he has an unconscious desire to hurt himself and not because he is careless or ignorant of safety-rules
 isi tarah, kuch zyada vajani log bhojan ke bilkul bhukhe nahin hote, lekin ladane or chumban ke liye baichaiyn rahete hai
 Eating is just a defensive response to lack of attention
 kuch shramik dusron kii tulana main upkarnon kii adhik kshati karte hai, kyonki unke achetan bhaawanaaon main prabandhan ke viruddh aakrosh he
 Psychiatrists say that some behaviors are so automatic that reasons are not available in the conscious mind of the person
 Compulsive cigarette smoking is an example of this
 kabhi-kabhi atmasamman ko banaae rakhana itnaa mahatvapurn hota he or kisi gatividhi ke liye abhiprerana aisi bhayaavah hoti he ki ise samajha nahin ja saktaa, vastav main, jo chhadmavesh main yaa dabaa di gayi hoti he
 It is known by the name of rationalization, or "beyond interpretation", such a disguise or defense system
 khud apni galtiyaan duusare par aropit karnaa ek anya misaal he
 "I think i am to blame", actually turns into "it is his fault, he is selfish"
 shaktishaalee lekin saamaajik rup se asweekaarya prerakashkti kaa daman dikhaawati vyavhaar main badal ja saktaa he, jo ki damit pravritiyon ke vipareet he
 For example, an employee who hates his boss, but does too much work to make it seem like he has a great respect for the boss
 achetan prerakashktiyaan maanav vyavhaar kii vyakhya main baadha daalati hai or ve jis had tak maujuud rahati hai, prashaasak ke jivan ko utana hi mushkil main daal detii hai
 On the other hand, knowledge of the existence of subliminal motivators can lead to more careful assessment of behavior problems
 haalanki kuch samakaleen manovaigyanik achetan karkon ke astitv se inkaar karte hai, kai logon kaa maananaa he ki ye keval chintaa or tanaav ke samay main sakriy hote hai or saamaanya jivan kii ghatnaon main maanav vyavhaar-kartta ke drushtikon se - yuktisangat rup se uddeshypurna hota he
 Beginning a study conducted on more than 6,000 people, Professor Steven Reis proposed a theory that states the 16 basic desires found in almost all human behavior
 ye icchhaaen is prakaar hai: In this model, people differ on these basic desires
 ye buniyadi icchhaaen aantarik prerana kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai jo vyakti ke vyavhaar ko sidhe prerit karti he or inkaa uddeshy paroksh rup se anya ichchhaaon ko santusht karne kaa nahin he
 People can also be motivated by non-basic desires, but in this case it is not related to serious motivation, or is not the only means as a means of achieving other basic desires
 abhiprerana par niyantran ko keval ek simit had tak samajha jaataa he
 There are different approaches to 'motivation training' , but many of these have been considered pseudoscientific by critics
 abhiprerana ko kaise niyantrit kiya jaae yah jaanane ke liye pehle ise samajhane kii zarurat he ki bahut saare logon main prerana kii kami kyon hoti he
 Modern thought provides empirical support to the psychological theory that emotional programming occurs largely in childhood
 michigan ke bacchon ke aspataal kii PET clinics ke chikitsa nideshak or wain state uniwarsity skool of medisin main bal rog, tantrika vigyaan or radiology ke praadhyaapak herold chugaani ne paaya ki vayaskon kii tulana main bacchon ke dimag nayi soochnaaon ko grahan karne main kahin adhik sakasham hote hai
 Brain activity in valvular regions is twice as large in children as three to nine years of age than in adults
 is avadhi ke baad, vayaskta ke saath-saath nirantar isamen giravat nimna str kii ore jaati rahati he

 abhiprerana ke bilkul sidhe drushtikonon ke alaava, praarambhik jivan main, aise samaadhaan hai jo adhik nirpeksh hai, lekin shaayad aatm-prerana ke liye adhik vyaavhaarik nahin hai
 In fact, every motivation guide has at least one chapter about the proper arrangement of one's actions and goals
 aamtaur par yah suzav diya jaataa he ki jo kaary puure ho chuke hai or jo kaam puure nahin hue hai, unke bich antar karte hue kaaryon kii suchi bananaa jaruri hota he isliye use banane ke liye kuch jaruri prerana ko us "meta-task" main sthanantarit karnaa chahie, kaary suchi main jise kaary kii pragati bataaya gaya he, jo ek dincharya ban sakati he
 Seeing a list of completed tasks can also be motivating, as it can create a satisfying feeling of accomplishment
 adhikansh electronic kaaryon kii soochiyon main yah buniyadi prakaaryaatmakataa he, haalanki puraa ho chuke or adhure kaaryon ke bich antar hameshaa spasht nahin hota he
 Other forms of information systems can also be motivating, such as the use of mind maps to organize one's thoughts and thus "train" neural networks in such a way that the human brain focuses on the given tasks
 
 The easiest way to mark ideas is that listing them with a rounding style will suffice, or it may be more useful for those who use the eye less often

1 ASP
NET ek web aplicoshan fremawork he jiskaa vikaas evam vipanan microsoft dwaara progaamar ko dynamik web site, web aplicoshan evam web sevaayen nirmit karne kii anumati hetu kiya gaya he
 It was first released in January 2002 with version 1
0 of the 
NET Framework and is the successor to Microsoft's Active Server Pages technology
 ASP
NET kaa nirmaan kaaman laguage rantime par kiya gaya he jisase progamaron ko koi bhi sahaayak 
NET bhashaa kaa prayog karte hue ASP
NET code likhane kii suvidha hoti he
 The ASP
NET SOAP Extension Framework allows ASP
NET components to process SOAP messages
 internat soochna sevaayen 4
0 ke 1997 main jari hone ke uparaant microsoft ne ek nae web aplicoshan model hetu sambhaavnaaon ke anusandhan par kaary prarambh kiya jo ki ASP ke sambandh main saamaanya shikayaton, visheshkar prastut evam saamagree ke prathakkaran ke sambandh main, kaa niraakaran kar sake evam "clin" code likhane main sakasham ho
 Mark Anders, manager IIS team and Duke University graduate Scott Guthrie, who joined Microsoft in 1997, was assigned the responsibility of determining this model
 anders evam guthrie dwaara do maah ke bheetar praarambhik dizin viksit kii gayi evam guthrie ne varsh 1997 main christmas ke avkaash ke dauraan praarambhik prototip ko kodebaddh kiya
 The initial prototype was called "XSP"
 varsh 2007 ke ek saakshaatkaar main guthrie ne bataaya ki "log hameshaa yah puuchhenge ki 'X' kaa kya matlab he
 At that time it did not really mean anything
 XML usase prarambh hua ; XSLT usase prarambh hua
 Every good thing seems to start with X, so that's why we explicitly named it
 "the initial prototype of XSP was built using Java, but soon it was decided to build a new platform on top of the Common Language Runtime because it Facilitated object oriented programming environment, garbage collection and other features, which were considered desirable features Microsoft's component object model platform does not support
 Guthrie termed the decision a "big risk" because the success of his new web development platform will depend on the success of CLR which is in the early stages of development like XSP, here The XSP team was also the first team at Microsoft to target the CLR
 kaaman laguage rantime kii gati ke saath, XSP ko c # main punah karyanvit kiya gaya evam iskaa naam parivartit kar ASP+ rakhaa gaya kyonki is bindu tak active sarwar pejiz ke uttaradhikari ke rup main nae plateform ko dekha gaya evam ASP viksitakartaaon hetu aasaan migration maarg uplabdh karaane kaa iraadaa tha
 Mark Anders performed ASP + for the first time at the ASP Connection Conference held on May 02, 2000 in Phoenix, Arizona
 vistrut janata ke samaksh pradarshan evam ASP+ kaa aarambhik beta release 11 july 2000 ko orlando, plorida main yojit 2000 profeshnal dablopers sammelan main kiya gaya
 During Bill Gates' keynote presentation, Fujitsu demonstrated the use of ASP + as a conjugate of COBOL and Microsoft's new Visual Basic 
NET and c # languages were announced to support it along with several other languages, in addition to active state Python and Perl support were announced as interoperability tools created by
 varsh 2000 ke uttarardh main "
NET" brands kaa ek baar nishchay ho jane ke pashchaat ASP+ kaa naam badalakar ASP
NET rakhane kaa nirnay liya gaya
 That year, Mark Anders at The MSDN Show stated that "the 
NET effort is about many factors, it's about providing software as a service, it's about XML and web services, and it's about the Internet i am about to increase its capacity accordingly
 

 ham iskaa naam 
NET fremawork banane vaale anya plateform anshon ke saath laana chaahate hai
 " chaar varshon ke vikaas evam 2000 va 2001 main beta relies kii shrenee ke uparaant, ASP
NET 1
0 ko 05 janvari 2002 ko 
NET fremawork ke sanskaran 1
0 ke ek bhaag ke rup main jari kiya gaya
 Even before release, dozens of books were written about ASP
NET and Microsoft promoted it as its platform for large-scale web services
 guthrie ASP
NET hetu utpaada unit prabandhak bane evam vikaas jari rahaa tathaa 24 april 2003 ko windos sarwar 2003 ke ek bhaag ke rup main sanskaran 1
1 relies hua
 This release focused on improving ASP
NET support for mobile devices
 
NET pej, jinhen vidhivat rup se "web forms " ke rup main janaa jaataa he, anuprayog vikaas hetu mukhya nirmaan block hai
 Web forms are present in files with the extension "
aspx"; These files specifically contain markup defining server side web control and user control with potential HTML markup in which the developers have all the necessary status and dynamic content for the web page
 iske atirikt dynamik code, jo ki sarwar par chalaata he, ko ek block ke bheetar ek pej main rakhaa ja saktaa he jo ki PHP, JSP tathaa ASP jaisi anya web vikaas praudyogikiyon ke samaan he, lekin data binding ke uddeshy ke alaava is tareeke ko saamanytah hatotsahit kiya jaataa he kyonki pej pradarshan ke samay isamen adhik colls kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Note that this sample uses the code "inline" as opposed to code-behind
 microsoft bihaind model kaa prayog karte huye dynamik progaam code ke saath kaary anushansit karata he jo ki is code ko ek alag file yaa vishesh rup se nirdhaarit script tag main rakhata he
 Code behind files are typically named like mypage
aspx
cs or mypage
aspx
vb while the page file is mypage
aspx the same as the file name but with the last extension denoting the page language)
 This method is automated in Microsoft Visual Studio and other ides
 progaming ke is tareeke kaa prayog karte huye deblpar dastavej ke prakriyaagat adhyayan ke sthaan par vibhinn ghatnaon jaise 'pej lod ho rahaa he' yaa 'ek control par clic kiya ja rahaa he' aadi ke uttar hetu code likhata he
 asp
net's code-behind model differs from traditional ASP in that it encourages developers to build applications, taking into account presentation and content separation
 siddhant rup main, yah ek web diziner ko, udhaaharan ke liye, ise chalaane vaale programing code main vyavdhaan hetu dizin markup par kam kshamta ke saath dhyaan kendrit karne kii anumati degaa
 This model is similar to the detachment of a controller from a view in a view-controller framework
 < / source> The above tag is placed at the beginning of the ASPX file
 @ pej kii code file gun vinirdesh file ko bataati hai jo ki code bihaind ke rup main kaary karte hai jabaki antarnihit gun us shrenee ko bataate he jisase pej praapt hota he
 In this example the @ page specification is included in samplecodebehind
aspx, then samplecodebehind
aspx
cs serves as the code-behind for this page
 is maamle main, page_load tarika ASPX pej ke aagrah ke samay prayek baar aamantrit kiya jaataa he
 The program can implement event handlers at different stages of the execution process to perform programmer processing
 ek event babling tantra iske yukt pej tak prayokta niyantran dwaara chalaaye gayi event ko paas karne kii yogyata uplabdh karaata he
 Programmers can also create custom controls for ASP
NET applications
 yuzar controlon ke pratikul, in controlon main apane samast code ek dll-file main ekatra karne vaali ASPX mark ap file nahin hoti
 aise custom controlon kaa prayog vibhinn web aplicationon evam vijual studio projecton main kiya ja saktaa he register vinirdesh kaa prayog karte huye, DLL se control ko lod kiya jaataa he
 ASP
NET uses a detailed compositing representation technique
 sangrah ke dauraan, template file pravartan code main sangrahit ho jaati he joki mul template ko prastut karte hue ek control tree banaati he
 The text moves to instances of a literal control class, and server controls are represented by instances of a specific control class
 pravartan code prayokta dwaara likhit code ke saath mila hota he tathaa pej ke liye varg vishesh main parinaam detaa he
 The page is doubled according to the origin of the control tree
 pej ke liye vaastavik anurodh ko kai charnon ke madhyam se sansaadhit kiya jaataa he
 First, during the enforcement steps, an instance of the page's square is created and the enforcement code is implemented
 yah praarambhik control tree banaata he jiskaa ab baad ke charnon main pej kii vidhiyon dwaara visheshrup se parichaalan kiya jaataa he
 Since each node in the tree is a control presented as an instance of a class, it can alter the structure of the code tree as well as manipulate the properties / methods of a single node
 antat:, prastutikaran ke charan ke dauraan, visitor kii vidhiyon kaa prayog karke prayek node ko swayan prastutikaran karne kaa nirdesh dekar, tree main prayek node dekhne ke liye ek visitor kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The resulting HTML output is sent to the client
 anurodh ko process karne ke baad prishth shrenee kaa udhaaharan tathaa purna niyantran vriksh alag kar diya jaataa he
 This is usually a source of skepticism for novice ASP
NET programmers who rely on category instance members that are lost with each page request / response cycle
 ASP
NET aplications, web sarwar par host kiye jate he tathaa state-les HTTP protocol par dekhe jate he
 Therefore, if the application uses a state-full interaction, then it must implement state management itself
 ASP
NET anuprayogon main state prabandhan ke liye ASP
NET vibhinn kaaryaklap pradaan karata he
 In theory, Microsoft considers "state" to be mostly GUI state, a major problem will arise when an application considers the need to monitor a finite state machine such as a "data track" that is a short-lived state during a request or to start it Takes time aplicoshan state upabhokta-paribhaashit vibhinnatao kaa sangrah he jo ki ek ASP
NET aplicoshan ke dwaara share kiya jaataa he
 When the event of application_onstart fires at the time of loading on the first occasion of application, at that time it is set and initialized and available till the last instance
 aplicoshan state vibhinhtaon ko aplicoshan sangrah kaa prayog karte hue dekha ja saktaa he jo ki aplicoshan state vibhinnatao ke liye aavaran pradaan karata he
 Application state variations are identified by name
 seshan state prayokta-paribhaashit seshan vibhinnataaain hoti he jo ki prayokta seshan dauraan maujuud rahati hai
 These variations are specific to different consumer session opportunities, and can be seen using the session session collection
 seshan vibhinnataaon ko niskriyata ke nirdhaarit samay ke pashchaat swayan hi nasht ho jane ke liye set kiya ja saktaa he, yadhyapi seshan samaapt nahin hua ho
 At the subscriber end, the user session is identified either by cookies or by encoding the session id in the URL itself
 ASP
NET, seshan vibhinnataaon ke liye percystance ke teen mod ko sahaayta karata he
 View state refers to the page-level state management mechanism used by HTML pages emitted by ASP
NET applications to maintain the state of webform controls and widgets
 controls kii sthiti ko kodebaddh kiya jaataa he evam _vustate naam se prachlit adrishy field main prayek form prastuti par sarwar ko bheja jaataa he
 The server sends the variable back so that whenever the page is re-rendered, the control is presented to its final state
 sarwar ke paksh main, anuprayog vustate ko parivartit kar saktaa he, yadi processing ke parinamswaroop control kii avasthaa main adhyatanikaran ho
 The state of independent or stand-alone controls on the server is decoded and available for use on ASP
NET pages using viewstate Collection
 iske liye mukhya uddeshy postbax se pare form soochna kaa sangrakshan he
 Therefore, when a user fills the form and enters an incorrect value, the form is automatically filled when returning the user for correction
 vustate bina kisi chook ke on hota he evam pej par prayek control ke baad yah data ko saamanytah shreneebaddh kar detaa he, is baat ko drushtigat kiye bina ki iskaa vaastavik prayog postbake ke dauraan hua tha
 Its behavior can be improved, however, viewstate can be disabled on a per-control, per-page, or server-wide basis
 deblopers ko pej yaa control ke vustate main samvedansheel yaa vyaktigat soochna bhandaarit karte samay saavdhaan rahane kii aavashyaktaa he kyonki vustate data vaale base 64 string ko web par uplabdh kisi bhi ek tul yaa kisi bhi jenrik base 64 dicoder dwaara aasaani se ashreneebaddh kiya ja saktaa he
 Without any omissions, _viewstate does not encrypt the value, however, encryption can be enabled on a server-wide basis to allow for the maintenance of a certain level of security
 ASP
NET ek "kaiche" lakshya pradaan karata he jise prayog ke dauraan share kiya jaataa he tathaa uskaa vibhinn lakshyon kaa bhandaaran karne ke liye bhi prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 The "cache" target only contains data for a specified amount of time that expires automatically as time passes
 ASP
NET dwaara saport kiye jane vaale state prabandhan ke anya tareekon main kukies, kaiching evam quarry string kaa prayog shaamil he
 ASP
NET lacks a template engine when it is first released
 kyonki 
NET kaa dhaancha lakshya unmukh hota he tathaa viraasat ko anumati pradaan karata he, jise kai deblopers "system
web
ui
page" se praapt kiye huye nayi aadhaar shrenee ko paribhaashit karenge, likhane kii vidhi jo HTML ko pratipaadit karti he tathaa baad main is nai shrenee se praapt kiye gayi prishthon ko apane aplicoshan main banaaange
 jabaki isse aam tatwon kaa site par punah prayog kiya ja sakegaa, isse jatilta main vruddhi hoti he tathaa markup ke saath strot code mil jaataa he
 More than this, this method can be tested only by starting the application and not while designing it
 Other developers have used the included file and other methods to avoid the same navigation and implementation of other elements of each page
 ASP
NET ne "master pejes" kaa dharna kaa parichay diya he jo ki template aadhaarit prishth vikaas kii anumati detaa he
 a web application can have one or more master pages that can be put together starting from ASP
NET 3
5
 master template main contint place holders ke naam se place holder control hote hai jo yah pradarshit karte hai ki gatisheel saamagree kahaan jaati he, saath hi saath HTML tathaa java-script child pejes ke dauraan prayog kiya jaataa he
 Child pages use content place holder controls that must be mapped to the place holders of the master page that are contained in the content page
 bache huye prishth ko master pej ke shared bhaagon se paribhaashit kiya jaataa he, jiseki verde procesar kaa mail-marz hota he
 All markup and server controller content place holders of the content page should be placed in the controller itself
 jab contint pej ke liye koi aagrah kiya jaataa he tab ASP
NET contint pej ke output ko master pej ke output ke saath milaataa he tathaa upabhokta ko output bhejtaa he
 The master page is fully accessible from the content page
 iskaa aashay yah he ki contint pej abhi bhi haders main parivartan kar saktaa he, sheershak ko badal saktaa he, kaiching aadi ko configure kar saktaa he
 If the master page exposes public features or methods, then the content page can also use it
 ASP
NET ke vibhinn sanskarnon ke saath sahabhaagi anya file vistaaron main shaamil hai: Generally, the ASP
NET directory framework is determined by the priority of the developers
 kuche ek arakshit nirdeshika naamon ke alaava, site main nirdeshikaon ko kisi bhi sankhya tak badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 The framework can typically be displayed directly in the URL
 yadhyapi ASP
NET processing ke dauraan kisi bhi bindu par anudesh ko rokane kaa upaay pradaan karata he, devlar ko kendriya aplicoshan athwa frant niyantrak ke madhyam se anurodh ko puraa karne ke liye baadhya nahin kiya jaataa
 Special directory name is: ASP
NET, web sarwar par ek yaa adhik DLL filon ke liye sarwar-said code ke sankalan ke dwaara anya script-aadhaarit praudyogikiyon ke upar nishpaadan laabhon ko uddeshit karata he
 This compilation occurs on the first request of the page itself
 yah feechar sankalit byanary ke nishpaadan laabhon ke saath scrypting bhashaaon ke dwaara aasaan vikaas pradaan karata he
 However, compilation can cause noticeable but brief delays for the web user when the latest compiled page is first requested from the web server, but not again until the requested page is further updated
 
 ASPX tathaa anya strot filein internet soochna seva sarwar par virtual host main place kii jaati he
 For the first time the client requests a page, pairs and compiles the net structure file in the net assembly and sends a response; Next requests are served from DLL files
 diphalt se hi, ASP
NET pratham anurodh par 1000 filon ke batch main puri site ko sankalit karegaa

 microsoft ne ASP
NET main plag karne ke liye kuch vistaar dhaancha jari kiya he tathaa uski kaaryashiltaa main vistaar kiya he
 some of them are: ASP
NET, vindose prayokta interphes ke samaan control se sankalit kiye gayi prishthon kaa nirmaan karne ke liye kshamta pradaan karke vindose aplicoshan vikaas se web vikaas ke liye devlopers sankraman ko aasaan banane kaa prayaas karata he
 Web controls such as buttons or labels work in the same way as its Windows model: the code can assign its own attributes and react to its event
 control ko jaankaree hoti he ki use kya karnaa he; jabaki vindose control screen par apane aap ko dra karata he, web control ech tii em el HTML tathaa java-script kaa bhaag nirmaan karata he jo ki and-yujar ke broujar ko bheje gayi parinaam prishth ke bhaag ko nirmaan karata he
 ASP
NET encourages programmers to develop applications using event-driven GUI models instead of traditional web-scripting environments such as ASP and PHP
 fremawork, java-script ) jaisi vartmaan praudyogikiyon ko swaabhaavik stateles web paryaavaran ko drudh state main laane ke liye aantarik ghatakon jaise - "viewstate" ke saath jodne kaa prayaas karata he
 Other inequalities when compared to ASP Classic are as follows: IIS 6
0 par tathaa usase neeche, e es pi fremawork ke vibhinn sanskarnon kaa prayog karte hue likhe gayi prishth third-party libraries ke upyog ke bagaiyr seshan state ko share nahin kar sakate
 yah aalochana ASP

 IIS-7 ke saath modul ekikrut pipe line main ran kar sakati he jo modul ko kisi bhi anurodh ko karyanvit karne ke liye koi bhi bhashaa main likhane kii anumati detaa he
 ASP
NET 2
0 produces web form markup that passes W3C validity, but it is controversial whether this increases accessibility, which is an advantage of the symbolic XHTML page + CSS representation
 kai control jaise ki loging control tathaa vijard control, diphalt se hi praaroop ke liye HTML teblej kaa prayog karte hai
 Microsoft has solved this problem by releasing the ASP
NET 2
0 css control adapter, a free add-on that adds a feature to the login control in ASP
NET 4
0, along with the creation of subsequent accessible XHTML + CSS markups Enables it to run on div mode instead of table mode
 prishthon kii punah sthiti tathaa broujar history badalane jaise ASP
NET web form feechar keval internet explorer main hi uplabdh hai
 Microsoft installs IIS / ASP

NET workars prakriya ke swayan hi punah shuru hone ke kaaran devlopers ko, custom state handlling modules jo ki kuch bahari process main state store karnaa chaiye, ko handcode karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 This can be explained with an easy example
 kalpana kijiye ek ASP
NET web site jo ki sarwar component par vishwaas karti he, use apane state ko surakshit rakhana chaiye tathaa state jatil algoritham - jaise ki nakshe ke upar super imposing root jeeyometry, ke parinamswaroop praapt kiya gaya tha
 One route has taken many CPU cycles to compile and multiply the next customer requests, it will see the conclusion when displaying the maptiles

 There are several available software packages for developing ASP
NET applications: jab ASP
NET ke saath vikaas kar rahe ho, tab maanak webfarms vikaas model kaa prayog aavashyak nahin he
 Notable frameworks designed for plate-form include: mono project ASP

NET 2
0 ko saport karata he
 ASP
NET can be run with mono using one of these three options: Apache hosting, fast CGI hosting, and XSP using the mod_mono module
