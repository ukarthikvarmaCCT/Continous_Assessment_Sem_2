ravan ke shashan kaal main lanka kaa vaibhav apane charam par tha or usne apana mahal puri tarah swarna rajit banaaya tha isaliye uski lankanagari ko sone kii lanka athwa sone kii nagari bhi kaha jaataa he
 Ravana has been mentioned in the texts like Padmapurana, Srimad Bhagavat Purana, Korampurana, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Anand Ramayana, Dasavatarcharit etc
 ravan ke udai ke vishay main bhinn-bhinn granthon main bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke ullekh milte hai
 According to the epic Ramayana written by Valmiki, Ravana was the most powerful king of Lanka
 ravan koun tha? dev or daitya aapas main sautele bhai hai or nirantar jhagadte aa rahe hai
 maharishi kashyap kii patni aditi se dev or diti se daitya janm liye
 diti kii galat kshikshaon kaa nateeja or aditi ke putron se apane santan ko aage banane kii hode main daitya galat disha main chale gayi or devataaon ke kattar shatru ban gayi
 yugon tak ladte rahe, kabhi daitya to kabhi devataaon kaa palada baari rahata tha
 Both devas and demons used to do penance, charity, charity etc
 performed excellent deeds, sometimes they received brides from Brahma ji, sometimes from Mahadev, and then the same deeds degrade each other
 The gods became unhappy due to the constant fight, then the gods prayed to Brahma Ji to do something
 Brahma ji told the gods about the churning of the ocean and told him about the nectar from which the Gods would drink, they would not receive death at the hands of the demons, and also said that it is not easy to churn the ocean in it
 Include and get the nectar tactfully, there are reasons to include the demons, one cannot do such a huge work alone and secretly, because the demons know Second, it will take a lot of labor
 On Brahma ji's point, then the gods persuaded the demons to talk about the ocean churn together and asked the demons to get many gems from the ocean, But did not talk about nectar
 The demons agreed, and then they said, "brother, decide in advance that if the first jewel comes out, who will take the second one, so that there will be no debate later
" Gods were a little nervous that at first, the nectar got out and the demons got into hands? But then, after saluting God in his heart, he believed that God will do his welfare and it has been decided that the first gemstone will come out, it will continue to follow the demons and then the same way
 To make the rope work for the churning, the gods prayed to Vasuki, the king of snakes, and he was also asked to share in the gems, Vasuki did not agree, he said what would he do with the gems? Then the gods explained to him separately and asked him to share in the nectar, then he was ready
 Prayed to Mount Sumeru, he was persuaded to become churner
 After all the preparations were completed, the ocean was churned on the appointed day on the parameters set, but as soon as the Mount of Madranchal was lifted into the sea, it sank directly into the depths of the ocean with the help of its weight and displayed its pride, then Banasura among the Asuras It was so powerful, he single-handedly lifted the mountain of Madranchal in one thousand arms and brought it out of the ocean and the pride of Madranchal was destroyed
 Pleased with the process of Dev and the demons and at the request of Brahma Ji, Lord Sri Narayana took a Kachhap avatar and placed the mountain on his back
 Sagar Manthan started: Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, Sapta Rishi, etc
 sat down at their respective places to see the process of Sagar Manthan and Dev Devas
 After many days of the beginning of the ocean churning, the first halal poison came out, the poison of which the demon and the beings of the three worlds, When the vegetation etc
 started becoming unconscious, the Gods prayed to God and Shri Vishnu said that only Rudra can save it
 Then Lord Rudra drank the poison but did not allow it to come down the throat
 His throat became blue due to the Halahal poison and since then he was called Devadhidev Mahadev and due to his throat being blue, Neelkanth was known and worshiped
 The churning started again, heat started due to the effect of poison on Lord Shankar's forehead, then at the time of churning, the moon entered the ocean with a fraction of it and appeared as a child with coolness and was present in the service of Mahadev
 Happened
 Lord Shiva was very angry at this devotion and beautified him to provide coolness in the form of Bal Chandra on his forehead
 Then came the Kamdhenu cow in the form of a gem and part of the demons, He thought without thinking about what we would do with the cow and donated that cow to the Saptarishis, now it was the turn of the gods but Mahalaxmi appeared in the gem
 The gods and the demons praised her and Sagar stared at her a part and bestowed Mahalakshmi Ji to Lord Vishnu and she was seated in the left part of Shri Vishnu
 Then Airavat came in the part of elephant gods, after this Kaustubh Mani and other gems came out
 And when a horse named Uchheshrava came in the part of the demons who started praising God with Vedas mantras, then the demons gave it to the deities with pride, keep saying, we do not need you who speaks the Vedas
 Then the alcohol came out, he was part of the demons, and after drinking it and drinking it, he became very happy
 The demons became very happy with alcoholic drinks and when the intoxication subsided a little
 After the churning started, it was the turn of the deities and with the nectar urn, Lord Dhanavantari of Lord Anvatara descended
 But the demons felt that there might be alcohol in it too, so they started trying to take that urn by force
 In order to deal with the growing conflict, Shri Narayan again took part in the form of siren from the sea
 All the gods and demons bowed down to Mohini as Ratnarupi Devi, then Mohini said, why are you fighting? And when the reason was known, he said that according to the rules fixed by you, those urns should be given to such deities, but even then if you want, i will end your dispute by sharing the contents of the urn in all of you, the deity understood
 That God is there and has come to help him, so everyone accepted the sweet words of Mohini
 Mohini asked everyone to sit in the row, then the devas were sitting in a separate row in the row, the nectar of the urn containing the urn, but the demons were considering it as a liqueur
 Mohini said, i will start from the line of gods, because you have already drunk the substance and started distributing it to the gods by saying this
 When one of the demons got intoxicated a little, he again secretly sat in the last place in the line of the gods, and he too got the nectar
 Surya and the moon complained to Lord Vishnu about this, then they hit the wheel to punish the demon for cheating, and the demon was panicked after cutting the head of the demon but that demon remained alive even after drinking the nectar
 
 sabhi daanav bole kya hua? kyun hua? kaise ho gaya? shri hari kaa chakra prahaar daanvon ko yah batalaane ke liye tha ki dhokhe se is daanav ne anadhikaar purvak drvy paan kiya tha jab mohini baant rahi thi to dhairya rakhana chaiye tha, tathaa amrit paan ke baad devtaa ab daanvon se zyada shaktishaalee ho gayi he at: ab daanav irshyaa vash devataaon se akaaran jhagadaa na karen
 jis daanav ne vesh badalakar amrit paan kiya wo galat tha kyunki tay maapdando ke aadhaar par amrit par devataaon kaa adhikaar tha uske baad bhi mohini amrit sab ko baant hi to rahi thi pankti main ek taraf se
 daanvon ko ab pataa chalaa ki kalash main madiraa nahin valki amrit he tab kuch daanav mohini se kalash chhin lene ke prayaas main aage aaye mohini bachaa hua amrit kalash devraj indra ko de kar chali gai or kaha tum log hi aapas main nipataara kar lo
 idhar us daanav ne jisane amrit pi liya tha uskaa sar rahu or dhad ketu naam se jivit rahaa or baad main use chaaya grah ke rup main pratishthit kar diya gaya
 After receiving the nectar, the mantle of the gods remained heavy and they fell heavily on the demons
 Meanwhile, the gods again gained power from Tapabal, when the demons got upset and they asked their Guru, "guruvar, how can we defeat the gods, then their master said that the gods have drunk the nectar, and it is very difficult to defeat them, and The only solution is that if the bright son of a superior Brahmin helps you, then the gods can be defeated
 Knowing the above, the demons thought, why would a Brahmin son do our work, it would be his wrongdoing to support us for this, and no ordinary brahmin of Prithvi Lok will be ready for this task
 If we do something by force, the best and the brightest Brahmin will destroy us and if we go to the weak Brahmin, then the gods will also laugh and our fame will be smeared
 The demons started during the period of churning and contemplation and they all came to a decision that if we donate our girl to a superior Brahmin, the Brahmin must accept it, because the Brahmin is bound to follow the best dignity
 , He will be our nephew and Brahmin too, we will give him Palanga Kshiksha Diksha, will run according to us and when we will fight with the gods
 Then a demon said that it is okay to donate the girl, but how will you donate? This is not the practice of the demons, how else would a Brahmin accept the gift
 We cannot do the rituals of the gods, because they are not compatible with us
 Other demons said that the matter is correct and postponed the meeting for another day to take the decision carefully
 At night a demon was very upset and upset in his house how to solve this problem
 He was sitting in his family
 His wife and daughter asked the reason for concern, Then he told them
 His daughter's name was Keshini, she said, "father, don't worry about the marriage of a demon girl with a superior Brahmin, i know Vishvarava, a superior Brahmin who lives in an ashram with his disciples in the forest near Aryavrit Pradesh
" They make their disciples study very calmly and peacefully, i have seen them, their knowledge is also very good, it seems to me that i have heard them secretly many times
 If father is your command, then i will go to him and ask him to accept me as his wife
 i am sure they will adopt me, i am familiar with their nature
 Hearing the daughter Keshini, her parents were very happy, the father told his daughter that the daughter thought for the protection and well-being of this demon clan, you are lucky and blessed, Tomorrow i will discuss this with everyone and then you will decide your decision
 On the second day, Keshini's father gave the suggestion given by his daughter Keshini to all the other demons, and all were very happy and gave orders to Keshini
 Keshini was successful in her work
 Even after being the daughter of a powerful demon, she humbly tried to allay her parents' worries and Vishrava, son of Maharishi Pulastya, Manasa son of Brahma, accepted her as his wife in the ashram
 As a good wife, Keshini served her husband for many years and one day her husband Rishi Vishrava was pleased and asked Keshini to ask for the groom
 Keshini asked for the boon of being the mother of wonderful and stunning sons, who also have the power to defeat the gods
 As a daughter, wife and mother, Keshini was completely successful in following her dignity
 keshini ne rishi se poocha yah to itane haath or sar leki paidaa hua he rishi ne kaha ki tumne adbhut putr kii maang kii thi isaliye adbhut arthath is jaisaa koi or na ho, thik vaisaa hi putr hua he
 uske pita ne gyarahawein din adbhut balak kaa namakarna sanskaar kiya or naam diya ravan
 ravan apane pita ke ashram main bada hua or baad main uske do bhai kumbhkarna tathaa vibhishana or ek atyant rupavati bahan surpanakha hui
 ravan janm kaa sayong kuch is tarah se bana tha
 It is a thing of the past that there were two gatekeepers named jai-vijay in Vaikuntha Lok
 Once, he had stopped the Shaunakadi Bal Rishis from going to Vaikunth, he felt that the children had good work with God
 Then one of the Shaunakadi sages cursed Jai Vijay that both of you followed the rule of death like a deadlock in Vaikunth lok and while living in the service at the door of Shri Hari itself, there is not even much knowledge, so you get death toll
 You will be The second child sage said that you do not even know that this tradition cannot be done in Shri Vishnu world
 Meanwhile, Lord Vishnu himself came to take those Shaunakadi sages after listening to the voice
 He and jai-vijay apologized to the sages
 On this, the sages said that the curse cannot be returned, when the time comes, you will have to go to the land of death, but as Shri Hari himself has come to take us, he will also come to the land of death to bring you back to Vaikuntha Lok
 The second reason was that once Naradji was proud of his devotion and he used to go to every world and talk about his devotion and penance
 Narada told his father Brahmadev, then he said that it is not good to tell Narada about his devotion
 Narada went to Kailash and told Bholenath there, he also said, Narada, you are saying this everywhere everywhere is not good
 But Narada was proud that there is no Narayan devotee like him in all the realms
 While returning from Kailash, Narada walked towards Vaikunth, then Lord Vishnu built a Maya city to destroy Narada's pride
 On the way from where Narada came, he saw a beautiful city
 Narada thought that i have gone to all the worlds and the city, but it has not gone to this city, so go here and see what city it is
 Narada reached there, it was a very beautiful city, even more beautiful than Indraloka, the king respected Narada, Sited in the palace and saluted Narada ji himself
 After refreshment etc
 said, Maharishi, you are Chiranjeevi, Trikaldarshi Mahatma, my daughter has kept herself after two days, then i have given an open invitation in all the three worlds that whoever my daughter wants will be married to her but if you give me Tell me how my son-in-law will be, then i will be satisfied
 Seeing the palmistry of his daughter, Narada said that your daughter is very lucky, it will get chirinjeevi, ajar amar, beautiful and shatoguni pradhan
 Whose fame is in all the realms, and Narada ji was fascinated to see that girl's form, he also saw all the qualities in himself which were telling his palm
 After this Narada ji left and read out to Vaikuntha Lok to speak about his devotion
 On the way, i thought that i have all the qualities but i am a monk
 Now i should also settle my home like the Saptarishis
 The girl you saw right now is suitable for marriage
 But there is a shortcoming, that is my form but there is nothing to worry about it because i am a devotee of God and now i will ask Lord Vishnu for his form and he will have to give it to his devotee
 Narada reached Vaikunth after some time, God welcomed him and asked, what is the matter in a hurry
 Narada said that God has been meeting you for so many days, i am coming to meet Lord Bholenath and have come to meet you
 Now anyway i have time because since i have attained the high stage of penance and devotion, i have reached the peak of knowledge, rituals and devotion
 i have also conquered Maya and now i am thinking that i should also become a planetary
 Seeing a girl on the way, who is full of all virtues, what should i tell you, God is omniscient and i am also your biggest devotee, so please help me
 God said with a smile, Narada, in your desire to become planetary, you seem to have become diseased on the beautiful form of the girl, so i will definitely remove this disease from you and do not worry
 If you are my biggest devotee, then i too have to cure my devotee's disease like a doctor
 Narada could not understand these sentences of God and said that Lord is the way to remove my disease, give me your own form so that i can look exactly like you in beauty so that the girl can select me
 God said Narada, i am your doctor, so i will cure the disease, don't you worry
 Narada said, God command me, now i go
 Narada ji was happy that now he too has become like Lord Vishnu and reached the day of swayamvara
 There were many people from all three worlds, the king gave everyone a seat to sit on
 Narada ji guessed the last time the king washed the feet by calling me Maharishi, Today, just by bowing in the usual way, gave the posture, it means that God gave me his form, then only this king could not recognize me today
 The girl who started on her own started to select a bridesmaid from one side and Narada ji to draw the attention of the girl standing twice from her place, and as soon as she came out, Narada ji would go to her neck
 Standing leaning forward
 But the girl went ahead and put Jayamala in the neck of another divine man
 The marriage of Kanya was done to them
 After marriage, two Shiva people who came there, looking at Narada, said, why were you being washed away again and again
 Narada was very angry at his words and said, why are you fools laughing and don't know who i am? They don't know who it is, but when they see it, they are absolutely monkeys, monkeys that are found on the dead
 When Narada saw his face in water, he saw a mouth like a monkey
 Shiva Gan again said, why are you looking for the monkey of the dead and laugh again loudly, Narada ji got more angry and cursed him that both of you are Shiva gana live in Kailash and ridicule me, Narada
 You mockingly say that the monkey of the dead land curses you, so you will go to the dead land and that monster will kill you, and then the monkey will beat you
 After this Narada ji moved rapidly towards Vaikuntha Lok with anger, he was very angry with Lord Vishnu
 raste main vahi kanya or var bhi vivaah ke baad ja rahe the
 jaise hi naarad ne baraat kros karte huye aage nikle var ne puch liya are naarad ji kahan ko chale? is prashn se hi naarad ko gussa aa gaya or thoda ruk ke bole oh to aap hai ab maine pahchaan liya he aap ko
 aap vishnu bhagwaan hai
 itnaa bada khel wo bhi mere saath maine aapako is kanya ke bare main batalaaya, jaankaree di or aapane is kanya ke rup gunon kii charchaa mujh se hi sunakar mujhe hi chalaa, or khud rup badal kar dusraa vivaah is kanya se kiya
 iske baad naarad ji ne shri hari ko bhi shraap de diya, jaise main patni ke viyog main hoon vaise hi aap ko bhi shraap detaa hoon ki aap bhi patni ke viyog main dukhi rahenge wo bhi mrityulok main kyunki asli viyog to kya hota he vahiin pataa chalegaa or aap patni ke viyog main meri tarah hi bhatakengen
 bhagwaan ne kaha naarad aapane shraap diya ise sweekaar karata hoon or phir apni maaya hataa di tab naarad ne dekha kuch bhi nahin tha naa wo nagar, na wo kanya
 naarad ne kaha yah kya hua? bhagwaan ne kaha tumne hi kaha tha naarad kii maaya ko jeet chuke ho isaliye tumhaari pariksha le rahaa tha
 Narada apologized to Shri Hari and Lord Vishnu disappeared
 Meanwhile, Lord Shiva also came there and asked Narada to forgive the crime
 Narada said that the curse will not be false, therefore you will be a demon, but i do so much that you will be such a primordial demon that Lord Shri Hari himself will come for your salvation
 iske atirikt teesraa yoga tha pratapbhanu jo chakravarti raja hone ke liye laalach main brahmanon ke shraap kaa shikaar ho jaataa he jisaki katha aage aayegi, jo sitaaji ke janm se bhi judy he
 Ravana appeared from these three curses and as part of all these
 The majestic quality of Pratapbhanu, the tamasic quality of Shiva Ganas and the virtue of devotion to jai-vijay, Ravan took birth as the head of the virtues of these three persons
 In childhood, Ravana got caught on four Vedas with his sharp intelligence, he had such a good knowledge of astrology that, his Ravana Samhita is still considered superior in astrologers
 At a young age, Ravana went out to do penance
 He knew that Brahma ji was his great-grandfather, so he did his austerities first and after many years of penance, Brahma ji asked him to ask for a boon, then Ravana asked to be immortal
 Asked for a boon
 Brahma Ji said, i cannot give a boon to be immortal, you are knowledgeable, so try to understand
 i cannot give you that but instead i give other powers
 Ravana got power from austerities and met the parents who were very happy
 Now a little pride came in the mind and one day, Ravana, taking two or four companions, went to the boundary of the kingdom of Sahastrabahu Arjuna in his youth, there he saw the water on the banks of the river Narmada even though it was very wide
 ravan ne apane saathiyon se kaha ye nadi kaa jal itnaa kam kaise he pehle to isamen bahut jal bharaa hua karata tha
 Then the fellows went ahead and saw a dam in which all the water of the river was stopped and the dam was made of arrows
 tab ravan ke saathiyon ne usko bataaya ki, kisi ne apni adbhut dhanurvidya ke prayog dwaara baanon se baandhakar jal ko roka he
 wo sab aage bade unhen kuch shastrdhari suraksha main lage sainik dikhe ravan ne poocha koun ho or ye baandh kisne banaaya he
 un logon ne kaha hamaare mahraaj sahastrabahu arjuna ne wo is samay apni patniyon ke saath vihaar karne aaye hai
 ravan ne kaha acha to ab meraa kaushal dekho or ek hi baan se usne baandh tod diya
 sahastrabahu kii patniyaan jo snaan karne ke liye gai thi bah gai kaaphi prayaas karne ke baad unhen nikaala gaya
 ravan ne baandh toda jab is baat kii soochna sahastrabahu ko uske sainikon ne di tab is baat par sahastrabahu or ravan kaa yuddh ho gaya or ravan haar gaya usko bandi bana liya or jail daal diya
 uske saathi bhaag gayi or ravan ke dada ji muni pulasthya ko bataaya gaya tab unhone sahastrabahu arjuna ke paas sandesh bheja ki ravan yuvak he or yuvavastha main galati kii sambhaavna ho jaati he isaliye use chod do
 arjuna ne use chod diya or chetavanee di ki dubaara is tarah kii galati na ho nahin to ek bhi sar dhad par nahin dikhaai degaa
 ravan ko bahut glani mahasus hui or usne varsho tak pun: brahma ji ke liye tap kiya
 or brahmadev ke prukat hone par usne phir se amar hone kaa vardaan maanga
 lekin is baar bhi use amar hone kaa vardaan nahin mila lekin or zyada mayavi shakti praapt hui
 mayavi shaktiyaan paa kar ek baar ghumte hue vaanron ke kshetra main pravesh kiya
 shaam kaa samay tha vaanron kaa raja baali us vakt ek vriksh ke neeche sandhya jap kar rahaa tha
 Ravana laughed at seeing him and then started teasing him, Ai mercut, Ai monkey started ridiculing him and provoked him to fight
 Ravana was proud of his elusive power, he said to the girl, Hey Mercut i have heard that you are very powerful
 Come and fight with me and see how i loosen your pride
 But Bali was in meditation, so he did not listen to it
 After this Ravana kicked him vigorously and said heresy is sitting in meditation with my fear after my defiance, speak directly that i cannot fight
 Bali was boiled with anger, he killed Ravana by beating him so much that he survived only by dying and then tied it in his tail and wrapped it again, ending Sandhya Vandan and he broke the pride of Ravana
 Six For months, Bali kept him in his captivity
 One day he was going to Bali by pressing him in his armpit with his left hand, then his hand got loose and Ravana ran away
 Now Ravan came to know that there are more powerful people than him, i had more pride due to my grandfather
 iske baad wo phir se ghor tapasya karne nikal pada or phir se usne amar hone kaa vardaan maanga
 brahma ji ne kaha putr mere adhikaar me wo vardaan nahin he or is baar usne brahma ji se prachand shaktiyaan or brahmastra praapt kiya
 ek din devataaon se kisi baat par naaraaz ho gaya or usne swarg main akele hi chadhai kar di or ghor yuddh main usne akele hi sabhi devataaon ko parrast kar daalaa
 indra, yama, varuna anya sabhi dikpaal or prajapatiyon ko bandhak bana liya anya sabhi devtaa swarg se bhaag nikle, usne swarg lok par adhikaar kar liya or baad main use devataaon ko lautaa diya, lekin devataaon kaa maan bhang ho gaya wo chupchaap ho gayi
 daanvon ko pataa chalaa ki unka bhaanja ravan akele hi swarg main sabhi devataaon ko parrast kar diya tino lokon main is baat kaa pataa chalaa or is baat se daanav bahut khush ho gayi unki varsho kii manokamana purna ho gayi or daanvon ne ravan kii jai jayakaar kii or ravan ko apana raja banane ki prarthana kii
 ravan ke tej or uske bhavy swaroop or netritv se may daanav ne prasann ho ke apni atyant sundar or maryaada kaa paalan karne vaali putree mandodari kaa vivaah ravan ke saath kiya or ravan patni rup main mandodari ko paa ke prasann hua
 pativrata naariyon main mandodari kaa sthaan devi ahilya ke samakaksh he
 ravan raja ke rup main rakshason dwaara pratishthit ho gaya to phir usne apane liye rajdhani kaa nirmaan karne kii sochi, wo phir se swarg gaya shaayad rajdhani banane ke liye ye thik rahe, sabhi devtaa indra, yama, varun use dekh bhaag liye, wo khus hua lekin use swarg pasand nahin aayaa vaapasi main lautate vakt use samudr main trikut parvat par sundar nagar najar aayaa
 wo sidhe udhar gaya vahaan usne dekha uskaa hi sautela bhai kuber yakshon ke saath rahata he usne kuber ko us nagar ko yakshon sahit khaali karne ko kaha
 kuber apane pitaaji ke paas gaya or kaha pitaaji ravan jabaran lanka khaali karne ko kah rahaa he tab unhone kaha putr ravan is vakt maanane waalon main nahin he at: tum use wo sthaan de do
 tum uttar disha main surakshit sthaan main chale jaao vahaan tumhen koi tang nahi karegaa
 apane pita ke aadeshaanusaar kuber ne himalay kshetra main alkapuri naam se nagar kaa nirmaan maansarovar jhil ke paas kar liya or yakshon sahit lanka se dhan daulat ke saath chalaa gaya
 idhar ravan ne trikutaparvat par lanka ko bahut sundar banwaaya
 uske sasur may naamak daanav ne jo mivi vidyaon main atyant nipun tha, usne lanka ko teenon lokon me sabase sundar nagar bana diya, sone kii panni se or heere jawaharaat, mania se lanka ke sabhi diwaaren, khanmbhe aadi ko mud diya or jab in kii kami mahasus hui to ravan, kuber se chin kar le aayaa
 ravan ne sabhi rakshason ko lanka main rahane kaa nirdesh diya or sabhi ko ek se ek sundar ghar or mahal diye, phir ek din kuber se puspak vimaan bhi chin liya
 rajya sthapana or sundar rajdhani basaa kar sabhi asuron ko acchhee tarah se sab sukh suvidhaayen uplabdh kara kar or unhen purna rup se surakshit kar ravan phir se brahmadev kii tapasya main lag gaya, use dekh baad main uske bhai kumbhkarna or vibhishana bhi uske saath tapasya main aa gayi
 brahma ji phir ravan ke paas aaye ravan ne kaha pitamah mujhe amarta kaa vardaan chaiye
 brahmadev ne kaha wo mere liye dena sambhav hi nahin he lekin ravan nahin mana brahma ji chale gayi
 ravan pun: tap main laga rahaa or varshon baad ghor tapasya se brahma ji phir ravan ke paas aaye usko samajhaayaa ki, ajar–amarta vaala vardaan mat maango tum gyani ho, sansar ke niyam ko pherane kii shakti mujh main nahin, main maryaada main hi kaam kar sakane kii shakti rakhata hoon, putr tum meri tapasya baar–baar kar rahe ho or mujhe vyavdhaan ho rahaa he isaliye jitna ho saktaa he main utna tumhen aaj de detaa hoon
 tumhaari naabhi main, main ek amrit kunda pradaan karata hoon or jab tak yah amrit kunda tumhaari nabhi main rahegaa tab tak tumhaari mrityu nahin hogi
 agar tum is par bhi santusht nahin ho or ajar-amar hona chaahate ho, to behatar he tum mahadev kii sharan main jaao
 mahadev kii main nahin jaanata wo amar hone kaa vardaan denge yaa nahin, kintu mere vash main to nahin he
 ravan ne phir brahma ji se poocha ki pitamah yah amrit kunda naabhi main kab tak rahegaa? tab brahma ji ne kaha agni baan ke atirikt is amrit kunda ko koi nahin sukha saktaa he ravan ne sochaa lagbhag amar hone jaisi baat he, kyunki agni baan kaa prayog bhagwaan vishnu ke atirikt anya koi nahin kar saktaa he isaliye usne brahma ji se kaha pitamah ab aap ajar amar hone kaa vardaan to nahin de rahe hai isaliye main ise sweekaar kar letaa hoon par aapako or bhi kuch dena hoga
 brahma ji ne kaha tum amar hone ke atirikt anya jo maango main dene ko taiyaar hoon tab ravan ne vardaan aise maanga ki usko dev, danuj, naag, yaksha, kinnar, gandharva koi bhi yudd main na maar sake
 brahma ji ne tathastu kah diya
 isi samay brahma ji kii drushti ek apsara par paddy jo paas main jo chhupake se apana kaan laga ke sun rahi thi ki brahmadev ravan ko kya vardaan de rahe hai
 brahma ji samaj gayi koun he kisne bheja he or wo apsara ghabaraate hue brahma ji ko pranaam karti he lekin uskaa is tarah chup kar dekhnaa brahma ji ko acha nahin laga, unhone sirf us apsara ko itnaa hi kaha ‘’jab tumne chup ke sun hi liya he to itnaa or bhi sun lo ki, jis din kisi vanar kaa joardaar mukka tumhaare isi kaan par padega, us din samaj lenaa ravan or rakshason kaa ant aa gaya” brahma ji chale gayi or apsara chupake se bhaagane vaali thi ki ravan ne use pakad liya or bolaa koun ho yahan kyakar rahi ho? usne bataaya ki yun hi brahmadev kya kah rahe he wo dekhne ai thi
 ravan samaj gaya ki devataaon kii chaal he isaliye usne us apsara ko kaha tumhen bahut zyada kaan laga ke sunne kii aadat he isaliye ab mere saath chal ab lanka ke dwaar par, vahaan koi ghuse tab kaan laga ke sunanaa or rakhwali karnaa or use lankini naam se mukhya dwaar par rakhwali ke liye rakh diya
 ravan ab tapasya janit apni shakti kii lagbhag charam seemaa par pahunch gaya tha isaliye abhimaan bhi swaabhaavik tha
 All the demons were safe under his umbrella, many of them were not able to do penance in fear of the gods, they started doing penance to gain power and all other demons started enjoying bliss and opulence in Lanka
 ek din ravan apane abhimaan or aishwarya ke bal par akele hi trilok main vijay ke liye niklaa or sutal lok main gaya
 vahaan sutal lok main raja bali rajmahal main the or ravan bade abhimaan or garajna ke saath unke dwaar par gaya or dwaar paal ko bolaa “ bali ko bolo ravan yuddh ke liye aayaa he” dwarpal ke bhesh main koi or nahin valki swayan narayan the unhone bali ko vardaan diya tha, ki uske dwaar par paharaa wo denge
 ravan ne jab dwaar paal ko jabaran dhamkaakar bolaa, to dwarpal ne kaha “he lankapati ravan, maharaj bali is vakt puja main he or puja kii samaapti ke baad wo tumse avashya ladgen, chintaa mat karo dhairya rakho, wo bhagwaan bhakt hai isaliye pehle wo us kaam ko hi puraa karange uske baad wo apana ye saamne rakhaa kavach pahanane ko yahan aaenge tab tumhaara sandesh unhen ham yaheen tumhaare saamne hi de denge”
 ravan abhimaan main chur tha or bolaa “acha is kavach ko pehnegaa wo main ise abhi tod detaa hoon
” ravan aage bada or us kavach ko uthaane kii koshis karne laga, lekin wo itnaa baari tha ki ravan ko uthaane main pasinaa aa gaya
 dwarpal ne kataaksh kiya lankapati ravan, hamaare maharaj bali kaa kavach tak uthaane main aapke maathe par pasinaa nikal aayaa he mujhe andeh ho rahaa he ki tum maharaj bali se kaise lad paaoge koi baat nahin kuch hi samay kii baat he or aap dhairya rakhen
 ravan man main dar gaya or baad aata hoon kahkar bhaag niklaa, waapas nahin aayaa
 ravan ne sabhi devataaon, yaksha, kinnar, gandharva aadi ko yudd main parrast karke rakshason ko abhaya kar diya or maanvon ko wo pehle se hi sochataa tha ki, wo kya ladgen bechaare sidhe saadhe log he isaliye prithvi ke anya bhu bhaagon par uske rakshas apni chalaa hi rahe the
 yadhyapi shaktishaalee rajyon, jinamein ayodhya, mithila, kaushal jaise anya raja the, wo bahut ucch koti ke pratapi or sakasham rajya the or kabhi seemaa vistaar ke liye yuddh nahin karte the, ye raja sanmargi or narayan bhakt the, unki praja bhi sukhi sampann or ucch koti kii thi
 maharaja dasharath to itane prakramee the ki, devraj indra ne tak unase yuddh main sahaayta maangi thi
 raja janak itane shreshth raja the ki unhen praja ke, hit ke kaaryo or sant seva main apni deh kii sud tak nahin hoti thi or isaliye unka naam videh bhi pads gaya tha
 Increasing from one to one sage, Maharshi, Muni including people like Parashuram, Viswamitra, Bamdev used to come in the court of these kings and for this reason no one could dare to see his kingdom teddy eyes automatically
 ek prashn uthta he ki ravan, sahastrabahu arjuna se, phir baali se maar khaaya, phir sutal lok main bali ke dar se bhaag gaya, ayodhya, mithila, kaushal, vaanron ke pradesh aadi uske adheen nahin the, phir ravan trilok vijeta kaise maan liya gaya? ravan ne brahma ji se nabhi kunda me amrit paaya isse uski mrityu sirf bhagwaan narayan ke atirikt kisi or se nahin ho sakati he is baat kaa usko gyaan tha, man main glani thi ki, agar-amar ho jaataa to kitna acha rahata kyunki uskaa laksh vahi tha or uske liye wo prayatnsheel tha
 But just being immortal does not make any need for force, skill and weapons, for that he got a lot from austerity
 At that time there were many other ascetics like Ravana, Raja Bali, Raja Bali of the Vanar region, Banasura etc
 Ravana thought after getting a boon from Brahma Ji, now he will be happy to take the boon of immortality and will take a boon
 Ravana started the penance of Lord Bhole Nath, did penance for years, Bhole Nath did not appear, Ravana thought that Bholenath is a happy Mahadev and i feel unhappy, thinking that he started doing more severe penance
 , Sometimes being Veena, sometimes playing Veena with the beautiful sources of Lord Bholenath, but the Lord did not turn up
 Ravana thought that his life was useless if he could not please Mahadev, Mahadev who soon becomes pleased with his devotees, and i was filled with self-pity thinking that i could not please him
 One day when he started offering flowers in the puja, the flowers fell short, then to complete the puja, he cut his forehead one by one and started climbing the place of the flower, thinking that in his life, Mahadev If you could not please, then that living person is damned
 Today my head is offered to Mahadev instead of the flower
 Ravana became insensible due to pain but did not leave his mouth saying every Har Mahadev
 Bowing with the last head and bowing to Mahadev, as soon as the sword struck, Mahadev appeared on his neck, held his hand, said, Ravan, i was very happy, you put your life in danger for me, what do you want
 Ravana, bowing at the feet of Mahadev with pain, said very politely, "O Devadhidev Mahadev, i have seen you, you are happy with me, i don't want anything anymore, i was meditating with the desire to ask, But i was blessed to see this beautiful form of you, you are happy, i am completely satisfied with this, Lord and i do not want to be bogged down, you gave me darshan, nothing is a big boon for me, so i have some Don't want Mahadev said, Ravan, i came to give you a boon only because of your resolve, so i cannot go like this
 Therefore, you feel free to ask, you ask for whatever you want
 Ravana said, "O Mahadev, o Devadhidev, o Bhaktavatsal, if you want to give, then give me your unwavering devotion and i will always keep chanting your mantra of" Nam: Shivaya ", apart from that i don't need anything
 Mahadev was very happy to hear that, whose goal was to achieve immortality and he is asking for devotion to God, who can be more knowledgeable than this
 Then Mahadev bestowed upon him his devotion and gave a boon that, your head again
 In addition, whenever an organ is cut, a new organ will sprout again in its place
 Mahadev knew that the guilt of losing Ravana to Bali and others in the battle is in his mind that he is not very powerful, so Mahadev gave him immense strength in addition to devotion and together gave a weapon called Pashupat
 After getting force from Mahadev, when he got up from his place and stepped forward to walk back, the earth shook and Ravana became very happy and again bowed to Mahadev and returned to Lanka
 Ravana of Mahadev became a dear devotee, used to go to Kailash from Pushpanak Vimana daily from Lanka and worship and worship Lord Mahadev there
 Mahadev knew that the guilt of losing Ravana to Bali and others in the battle is in his mind that he is not very powerful, so Mahadev gave him immense strength in addition to devotion and together gave a weapon called Pashupat

 ravan ne teenon lokon ko apni gati se chalaane vaale nau grahon ko jab apane adheen kar liya, or digpaalon se usne apane lanka ke margo me jal chhidkaav ke kaam main laga diya tab use ek tarah se trilok vijeta mana gaya, kyunki trilok kaa sanchaalan karne vaale sabhi devtaa, nau grah uske adheen the or ab use bhi parajeet karne vaala trilok main koi nahin tha usne teenon lokon main rahane vaale adhikansh bhaagon ko apane adheen kar liya tha
 Once Narada ji came to Lanka again, Ravana served him very well, Narada ji said to Ravana, "have you heard that you are stronger than Mahadev, Ravan said yes, you are right
" Narada said how much strength he could get
 Ravan said that it is not known but if i want, i can move the earth
 Narada said, then you should also take a test of that force because a person must know his strength
 Ravana liked Narada's words and said, Maharishi, if i bring Mahadev along with Mount Kailash to the loot of the desert, how will it be? With this, i will know how much strength is there inside me
 Narada ji said that Idea is not bad and left after that
 One day Ravana tried to take Mahadev along with Kailash to Lanka on the strength of devotion and power
 As soon as she raised the mountain of Kailash in her hands, the devi sati started sliding, she said loudly, stop! He asked Mahadev about this, why is this Kailash being shaken by Mahadev, Mahadev said that Ravana is trying to take us to Lanka
 When Ravana raised Kailash mountain along with Mahadev in his hands, he also felt very proud that if he can raise Kailash mountain along with Mahadev, then there is no other impossible for him and his balance as soon as Ravana kept his balance
 Shook but even after that, he kept on in his body and in such a time, the devi slipped once again, he got angry and cursed Ravana that "hey arrogant Ravan tu aaj Area will be counted monsters Kyuँki your nature went're like demons and ye are arrogant
 Ravana did not pay attention to the words of Devi Sati, then Lord Shiva started to increase his weight and with that weight Ravan started to place Mount Kailash slowly on the same place and with the weight he had one hand and he ached
 Shouted, the sound of his shouting was heard till heaven and he fainted for some time and then on regaining consciousness he praised Lord Mahadev's beautiful "jatatvigaljajalpravahpavitsthal throat" Bitan Bhujngtungmalikam 


 Bholenath's praise pleased passes said that Ravana though i know the world of the macabre dance called the dance act because i would dance'll if anger
 But today you got my mind to dance happily from this beautiful source and beautiful singing
 This source composed and sung by Ravana is called Shiva Tandava source, because the dance of Lord Shiva is called Tandava but he is in anger but in this source, God dances happily
 After this, Lord Shiva pleased Ravana and gave him a sword named Chandrahas, in whose hands no one could defeat him in a battle in three worlds
 Since the curse of the Goddess Sati, Ravana began to be counted among the demons, and there was no harmony with the demons, so pride, wrongdoing in the demonic association went on increasing even more, before the curse he was a Brahmin and used to do satvik austerities
 The work of bringing water to the worship of Brahmadev and Mahadev was also given to the deities
 But later he fell into the Tamasi Prakruti from Satvik and the association of Asuras and Asuras led to the fall of Ravana due to these two reasons
 Other demons raised the benefit of Ravana's name more than Ravana, tax collection in his name, Sidda, Saints and sages started being insulted
 The demons used to remove their hatred from the gods, they sometimes cows and Brahmins, because there are very few gods left in heaven, perhaps the gods are Brahmins by changing this form and helping the gods to become saints
 Started giving and killing everyone
 ramayana ke anusaar ravan ke pita vishrava the to rishi pultsay ke putr the
 Ravana's mother was Kaikasi, who belonged to the demon clan, so Ravana was the child of Brahmin father and demonic mother, and Ravana, despite having excelled in many disciplines, Vedas, Puranas, Niti, Philosophy, Indrajal, etc
, his tendencies were demonic and terror all over the world
 Used to stir

 Ravana liked Narada's words and said, Maharishi, if i bring Mahadev along with Mount Kailash to the loot of the desert, how will it be? With this, i will know how much force is there inside me
 Narada Ji said that the idea is not bad and went away after that

 After defeating many kings Maharajas, Dasgriva reached Anaranya, the king of Ikshvaku dynasty who ruled over Ayodhya
 usne unhen bhi dwand yuddh karne athwa paraajay sweekaar karne ke liye lalakaara
 Both fought fiercely, but Ravana could not be defeated by Brahmaji's boon
 jab anrany kaa sharir buree tarah se kshat-vikshat ho gaya to ravan ikshvaku vansh kaa apmaan or uphaas karne laga
 Annoyed by this, Ananya cursed him that you have insulted the Ikshvaku dynasty with his sarcastic words, so i curse you that in this lineage of Mahatma Ikshvaku, dasharatha-nandan Rama will be born who will kill you
 yah kah kar raja swarg sidhaar gayi
 Having got elusive powers, he once roamed the region of monkeys
 It was evening, Bali, the king of the apes, was chanting evening under a tree
 ravan use dekh kar hansaa or phir use chhedne laga i mercut, i bandar bol uskaa uphaas karne laga or yuddh karne ke liye uksaane laga
 ravan ko apni mayavi shakti par ghamand aa gaya tha wo baali se kaha are mercut maine suna he tu bahut shaktishaalee he aa jaraa mujhase yudd kar ke dekh tera abhimaan main kaise dhilaa karata hoon
 lekin baali dhyaan main tha isaliye usne isaki baat ko suna hi nahin
 iske baad ravan ne usko jor se laat maari or bolaa paakhandee mere lalkaarane ke baad mere dar se dhyaan main baitha he, sidhe-sidhe bol ki main nahin lad saktaa
 baali krodh se oobal pada usne ravan ko patake-patake kar itani maar maari bas wo sirf marane se hi bachaa or phir use apni punch main band kar lapet liya, pun: sandhya vandan samaapt karke usne ravan ke garv ko chur-chur kar diya
 chha: maheene tak baali ne use apni kaid main rakhaa ek din use apane baane haath se usko apni kaankh main dabaakar baali ja rahaa tha tabhi uske haath kii pakad dhili ho gayi or ravan bhaag niklaa aisa bhaaga kii dikhaai nahin diya
 ab ravan ko pataa chalaa ki usase bhi balashaali log hai mujhe hi pitamah kii vajah se abhimaan zyada tha
 After this, he again went out to do austerity and again he asked for a boon to be immortal
 Brahma ji said that son is not that boon in my possession and this time he got tremendous powers and Brahmastra from Brahma ji
 ravan me kitna hi rakshasatv kyon na ho, uske gunon vismrit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It is believed that Ravana Shankar was a great devotee of God
 vah maha tejasvi, pratapi, parakramee, rupavaan tathaa vidwaan tha
 Valmiki, accepting his qualities with impartiality, calls him a world-renowned knowledgeer and great scholar of the four Vedas
 ve apane ramayana main hanuman kaa ravan ke darbar main pravesh ke samay likhte hai He further writes, "rama becomes enchanted on seeing Ravana and says that even if he was not strong in form, beauty, patience, patience and good conduct, he would have become the master of heaven even if there was no unrighteousness in this Ravana
 " While Ravana was wicked and a sinner, there were also manners and high ideals in him
 ram ke viyog main duhkhi sita se ravan ne kaha he, "he site! yadi tum mere prati kaam-bhav nahin rakhti to main tuje sparsh nahin kar saktaa
 "according to the scriptures, Vandhya, Rajswala, Akama, etc
 have the intention to touch the woman, so by not touching Sita, the non-cama, Ravana conducts the scriptured dignity
 valmiki ramayana or ramcharitamanas donon hi granthon main ravan ko bahut mahatva diya gaya he
 Being the children of demonic mother and sage father, always two conflicting elements keep churning the conscience of Ravana

 In her Ramayana, Mandodari mourns over the slaying of Ravana, saying, "the one who eradicates many yagyas, breaks the religious system, devas and asuras and the girls of human beings are here and there!" It is because of this that slaughter is achieved
 " tulsidas ji keval uske ahankaar ko hi uskaa mukhya avagun bataate hai
 He has described Ravana outwardly as a devotee of Rama with heart and being a devotee of him

 The discussion of Ravana having ten heads comes in Ramayana
 vah krishnapaksh kii amavasya ko yuddh ke liye chalaa tha tathaa ek-ek din kramshah ek-ek sir katate hai

 ramcharitamanas main yah bhi varnan aata he ki jis sir ko ram apane baan se kaat dete hai punah uske sthaan par doosraa sir ubhar aata tha
 It is a matter of consideration whether a new limb can be produced again if one organ is cut? In fact, these heads of Ravana were artificial - made from demoniac Maya

 Rameshwaram Gandhamadan mountain, which is situated to the north of Mount Kailash, is still inhabited by 'hanuman ji'
 manyataon anusaar kailash parvat se uttar disha kii ore ek jagah he, jahaan hanuman ji aaj bhi nivas karte hai
 The description of this abode of Hanuman ji is also found in many texts and Puranas 
 hanuman ji ko maa sita se amarta kaa vardaan praapt hua tha
 When they reached Mother Sita with Shriram's message, then Mother Sita gave them this gift of being immortal
 puraanon ke anusaar, kaliyug main hanuman ji gandhamadan parvat par nivas karte hai
 According to a legend, the Pandavas had reached Gandhamadan after crossing the Himvant at the time of their unknown exile
 ek baar bhim sahasradal camel lene ke liye gandhamadan parvat ke van main pahunchen, tab unhone hanuman ji ko vahaan aaraam karte dekha to bhim ne unase apni poonch ko maarg se hataane ke liye kaha to hanuman ji ne kaha ki tum swayan hi hataa lo lekin bhim apni puri takat lagaakar bhi unki poonch hataa nahin paaya tha
 It is mentioned in the scriptures that Gandhamadan mountain is situated to the north of Mount Kailash, where Maharishi Kashyapa did penance
 is parvat par gandharva, kinnaron, apsaraon or sidgh rishiyon kaa nivas he
 It is considered impossible to reach the summit by any vehicle
 gandhamadan parvat himalay ke kailash parvat se uttar disha kii ore he
 This mountain was in the territory of Kubera
 sumeru parvat kii chaaron dishaao main gajadant parvaton main se ek ko us kaal main gandhamadan parvat kaha jaataa tha
 Today this area is in the area of tibet
 isi naam se ek or parvat rameswaram ke paas bhi sthit he, jahaan se hanuman ji ne samudr paar karne ke liye chalaang lagaai thi

 In the present age, the pole star is located at the north pole of the celestial sphere, that is, from most places in the world, the pole star appears to be above the Earth's North Pole
 is kaaran se taron se maargdarshan lete hue samudr yaa registan jaisi jagahon se nikalne vaale yatri aksar dhruv taare kaa prayog karte hai
 Due to the rotation of the Earth, almost all the stars of the sky slowly rotate in the night, but the pole star seems to be fixed towards the north

 shookar influenza, jise ech1en1 yaa swine flu bhi kehete hai, vibhinn shookar influenza vishaanuon main se kisi ek ke dwaara failaayaa gaya sankraman he
 The swine influenza virus is any strain of influenza virus that is responsible for endemic pigs
 2009 tak gyaat es
ai
ve upabhedon main influenza si or influenza e ke upaprakaar ech1en1, ech1en2, ech3en1, ech3en2 or ech2en3 shaamil hai
 This type of influenza also affects humans and birds
 shookar influenza vishaanu kaa duniya bhar ke suaro main paaya janaa aam he
 The transmission of this virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always cause human influenza, often producing only antibodies against it in the blood
 yadi iskaa sancharan, maanav influenza kaa kaaran banataa he, tab ise zunotic shookar influenza kaha jaataa he
 Individuals who are regularly exposed to pigs are at greater risk of infection with the flu
 yadi ek sankramit suar kaa maance thik se pakaaya jaye to iske seven se sankraman kaa koi khatra nahin hota
 In the mid-20th century, it became possible to identify subtypes of influenza, which led to an accurate diagnosis of its transmission in humans
 tab se aise keval 50 sancharanon kii pushti kii gai he
 These strains of swine influenza rarely transmit from one human to another
 maanav main zunotic shookar influenza ke lakshan aam influenza ke lakshanon ke samaan hi hote hai, jaise thand laganaa, bukhaar, gale main karaash, khaansi, mansapeshiyon main dard, tej sir dard, kamajori or saamaanya bechaini
 Influenza infection in pigs can cause fever, lethargy, sneeze, cough, difficulty breathing and loss of appetite
 kuch maamalon main yah sankraman garbhpaat kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 Although death usually occurs in only 1–4% of cases
 yah sankraman boar kaa vajan gata or vikaas ko prabhavit kar saktaa he jo inke palko ke aarthik nuksaan kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 The weight of an infected pig can decrease from 5 to 6 kg over a period of 3 to 4 weeks
 manushyon main shookar influenza kaa mukhya lakshan hai: - In some cases, the transmission of the swine influenza virus is possible from pigs directly to humans, in which case it is called zoonotic swine influenza
 1958 se lekar abhi tak aise sirf 50 maamle hi report huye hai, jiname se bhi sirf 6 vyakti hi mrityu kaa grass bane hai
 Of these six people, one was a pregnant woman, one had leukemia, one was suffering from Hodgkin disease and two were already healthy
 bhale hi yah pratyaksh maamle bahut kam lagen par vaastavik sankraman kii sahi dar isse kahin adhik ho sakati he, kyonki zyaadaatar maamalon main yah saamaanya rog hi prathit hota he or is kaaran ise report hi nahin kiya jaataa
 Two of the three lineage influenza viruses responsible for human influenza can also spread influenza to pigs, of which influenza a is very common but influenza c is rarely found
 abhi tak influenza bi ko siiron main nahin dekha gaya he
 The strains found in humans and pigs within influenza a and influenza c differ, although re-segregation has resulted in large-scale gene transfer across strains whether present in pigs, birds, or human species
 influenza si vishaanu, maanav or siiron donon ko sankramit karata he lekin iskaa sankraman pakshiyon main nahin hota
 In the past too, it has been transmitted between pigs and humans
 udhaaharan ke liye, influenza si ke kaaran japan or california main bacchon ke bich influenza kaa kam prabhavi prakaar failaa tha
 Influenza c has not been able to cause epidemics in humans due to its limited heterogeneous range and lack of genetic diversity
 shookar influenza, influenza e ke upaprakaar ech1en1,ech1en2,ech3en1,ech3en2, or ech2en3
 ke kaaran hota he
 Among pigs worldwide, the three influenza a virus subtypes H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 are the most common
 ech1en1 spanish flu se aayaa, jo 1918 or 1919 ke dauraan faili ek mahamari thi jisase lagbhag 5 karod log maare gaye the
 The virus that came from Spanish flu was present in pigs
 iskaa sanchalan 20 veen sadi ke dauraan manushyon main bhi hua, yadhyapi yah varsh ke us samay hota he jab prativarsh hone vaali mahamariyaan failati hai, jisase 'saamaanya' influenza or shookar influenza main antar kar paanaa kathin he
 However, cases of infection from pigs to humans are rare and 12 cases have been reported in the US since 2005
 yahe == manushyon main shookar influenza yah shookar ke dwaara manushyon main failaa
 The disease spreads more in the cold

 His grandfather started this magazine and Rai had been collecting money for this for a long time

 1964 main raay ne charulatha film banaai jise bahut se aalochak inaki sabase nishnaat film maanate he

 Peter Sellers and Marlon Brando were cast for its lead roles
 raay ko yah jaanakar aashcharya hua ki unke kathanak ke prakashnadhikaar ko kisi or ne hadap liya tha
 Brando later exited the project and Rai was also disillusioned with the film
 columbia ne 1970 or 80 ke dashakon main kai baar is pariyojna ko punerjeevit karne kaa prayaas kiya lekin baat kabhi aage nahin badi
 Rai has cited a 1980s site and sound format for the project's failure and other details by his official biographer Andrew Robinson in The Inner Eye

 Subrata Mitra's work in the cinematography of early films is highly appreciated and critics believe that when Mitra left after the rift, the level of portrayal of Rai's films decreased

 Rai is criticized mainly for the speed of his films
 aalochak kehete hai ki ye ek “rajasi ghonghe” kii gati se chalati hai
 Rai felt himself that he could not do anything about this pace, but Kurosawa said in favor of him, "they cannot be called slow

 "apart from this, some critics consider his humanity to be plain and his actions anti-modern and say that his films do not show new styles of expression

 For example, Acer Pithe Dui
 raay ko paheliyon or bahuarthi shabdon ke khel se bahut prem tha

 saundaryashastra darshan kii ek shakha he jiske tahat kala, sahitya or sundarata se sambandhit prashnon kaa vivechan kiya jaataa he
 There is a word in the Greek language 'esthetico' which implies the derivation of 'esthetics', for the sense that is received by sense perception apart from the realm of knowledge
 prakruti, kala or sahitya se sambandhit clasical saundaryashastreey drushtikon viksit hua
 This approach keeps the political and contextual dimensions of the work out of the scope of the work, keeping its concern only with the beauty and art form
 lekin kala or sahitya vivechna kii kuch aisi vidhiyaan bhi hai jo kritiyon ke taatpary or unki rachana-prakriya ke saamaajik or aitihaasik pahaluon se samvaad sthapit karti hai
 Marxist aesthetics is one such discourse

 In this work, Kant insisted on universalizing the criterion of aesthetics
 lekin duusari ore ve kisi bhi tarah ke saarvbhaum saundaryashastra kii sambhaavna par andeh karte hue bhi nazar aaye
 Despite this contradiction, Kant's achievement was that he established some essential dialects to explore art and beauty
 in dvibhajanon main sarvaadhik ullekhneey hai : indriyabodh or tark-buddhi, sarawastu or rup, abhivyakti or abhivyakt, anand or upsanhaar, swatantraaa or aavashyaktaa aadi
 Kant's second achievement was that he distinguished between aesthetic experience and aesthetic experience
 unka kahana tha ki saundaryashastreey vyakhya or uski nishpatti vishleshan ke lakshya ke prati bina kisi vyaavhaarik aasakti ke hi kii jaani chahie
 The nineteenth century can be said to be a century of aesthetics

 Hegel in his works Lectures on Esthetics, Schopenhaur in The World as Will and Representation and Nietzsche in Fine Births of Tragedy gave various interpretations of various aspects of Western aesthetics and published new dimensions

 But the sounds of opposition to this movement were made by the great Russian litterateur Leo Tolstoy, What is Art? And narrated the work of John Dewey, the leading spokesman for American consequentialism, in Art as Experience
 tolstoy kaa tark tha ki jo kala manushyon ke bich naitik anubhutiyon kaa sampreshan nahin kar sakati, vah rupavaadi kasautiyon ke hisaab se kitni bhi mahaan kyon na ho, uski saraahna nahin kii ja sakati
 Divi also protested against art being cut from the structures of experience outside the realm of aesthetics in the name of aesthetics, taking ironics from the question of the role of communication

 Aesthetic theories were further enriched using tools of phenomenology, hermeneutics and Marxism
 1936 main martin haidagar ne ‘da orijan of da work of art’ jaisaa niabandh likhaa jise kala ke darshan kii sarvshereshth rachanaaon main se ek mana jaataa he
 Heidegger claimed in this essay that viewing art work as an object in this world is one of the fundamental semiotic errors of modernity
 hidagar ke mutabik kala to ek naye jagat ke dwaar kholti he, kala ke rup main satya apane-aap main ghatata hi nahin hamaare apane anubhav ke daayre main vastuon ke astitv kaa udghaatan bhi karata he
 In this way, through aesthetics, Heidegger criticized modernity and took on traditional existential epistemology and technological interpretation of things
 beesvin sadi ke madhya tak saundaryashastra kii upyogita par sawaal uthne lage
 In some of his lectures given at the beginning of the century, Edward Bulow had asked the question whether the definitions of art and beauty were eroding the creation-ability of the artist
 ye vyaakhyaan 1957 main chape or saath ke dashak main america kalakaar barnet newman ne elaan kar diya ki saundaryashastra kaa upyog kala ke liye vahi he jo pakshishastra kaa pakshiyon ke liye hai
 That is, an artist ignorant of aesthetics is good

 Pierre Bordeaux not only identified the ideological underpinnings of art under the sociology of culture, but also stated that aesthetics has not been able to establish its own cultural and political roots
 bordiyo ke is vichaar kaa pratwaad adorno kii rachana esthetic thiyari main miltaa he
 Adorno cites the example of twentieth-century non-standard art, saying that art still has the potential to counter ideology
 adorno ke mutabik kala apane samaaj kii upaj zarur hoti he, par uskaa rachana- prakriya main saamaajik niyatatvavaad se swytt kshan bhi nihit hota he
 Therefore, it also gives the artist and his audience or reader an opportunity to think in ways other than those used by the then dominant culture
 kuch marxvaadi vidwaanon ne saundaryashastra kii ek marxvaadi shrenee viksit karne kii koshish bhi kii he
 In view of such efforts from a critical point of view, the leading Marxist literary critic Namwar Singh of Hindi has considered the first example of this as the creation of 'socialist Realism' in the Soviet Union
 unhone kaha he, ‘shaastra banate hi saamaajik yatharth bhi sutarabaddh ho gaya or us yatharth ko abhivyakt karne kii style bhi
 a new formalism got under way, both in composition and in criticism
 jis desh ne samaajawaadee kranti kii, vah sahitya or kala ke kshetra main koi kranti karne se thithak gaya
 Such an insult to reality was not even in the literature before the revolution, and not even in the literature of the nineteenth century Europe when the Bourgeois Revolution gave rise to realism
 haalat bahut kuch hindi kii ritivaadee kahi janevaali sahitya-pravriti kii- si ho gayi, jab alankarishastra ke lakshan granthon ko saamne rakh kar kavitaayen likhi ja rahi thim
 ' namvar singh ne doosraa udhaaharan jorge lukach dwaara rachit saundaryashastra naamak vishaal granth kaa diya he
 He describes it as a monumental attempt by Lukach to finally compile his nearly sixty years of long literature into an orderly scripture, 'this huge text of thousands of pages is still available in the German language and which the Germans would know well, He will be able to say something confident about it
 angrezi main abhi tak uske bare main jo kuch kaha gaya he or uske chhitput anshon se jo abhas mila he uske aadhaar par itnaa to kaha hi ja saktaa he ki isamen samast kalaon ko ‘anukaran’ main nisshesh karne kii asafal cheshtaa kii gayi he
 In this way, when the Marxist Lukach goes on tying all the arts into one scripture, he is ultimately forced to go to Aristotle
 kisi angrezi saptahik ne is granth kii samiksha ke saath ek aisa cartoon chapa tha, jisamen lukach marks kii dadhi ke saath arestu kii shakl- surat or poshaak main pesh aate hai
 Namvar Singh believes that Lukach's parable reveals a weak aspect of this long tradition of Marxist aesthetics
 ve kehete hai ki ‘aksar vah swayan ‘kala’ naamak sanstha ko chunauti dene main chook gaya or kala kii clasiki paribhaasha ko sweekaar kar lene main use koi haani nahin dikhaai padi
 Once these definitions are accepted in the basic form, then with some manipulation, the work of evaluating this poet or work remains; And needless to say that Marxist aesthetics have demonstrated their talent in this field - competing with the biggest thinkers of high culture
 vyakhya or moolyankan kii bhashaa nishchay hi bhautikwaadi bhi he or aitihaasik bhi, lekin kul milakar vah prabhutvshaalee parampara se bahut alag nahin he

 Once bhagwat-anuragi and saintly maharishis prayed to Sutaji, the supreme disciple of Sri Ved Vyas - o Gyanasagar! We were very happy to hear the divine character and wonderful legends of Lord Vishnu and Shankar from your Shrimukh
 ishwar main aasthaa badi or gyaan praapt kiya
 Now please, please recite by reciting the holiest Purana narratives that provide all the pleasures to mankind, who give spiritual power and provide enjoyment and salvation
 gyanechhu or vinamr mahatmaon kii nishkapat abhilaashaa jaanakar mahamuni sutaji ne anugrah sweekaar kiya
 He said - Out of a desire for public welfare, you expressed a great desire

 It is true that Shri Mad Devi Bhagavat Purana is great in all the scriptures and religious texts
 iske saamne bade-bade tirth or vrath naganya hai
 On hearing this Purana, sins are destroyed by burning like a dry forest, due to which man does not have to suffer grief, grief, sorrow etc
 jis prakaar surya ke prakaash ke saamne andhkaar chant jaataa he, usee prakaar bhagwat puraana ke shravan se manushya ke sabhi ksht, vyaadhiyaan or sankoch samaapt ho jate hai
 The Mahatmas kept these curiosities with regard to Bhagavata Purana from Sutji: maharishi parashar or devi satyavati ke sanyog se shrinarayan ke anshavatar dev vyasaji kaa janm hua
 Vyasji, recognizing his time and the state of the society, divided the Vedas into four parts and made his four Patu disciples understand them
 iske pashchaat vedadhyayan ke adhikaar se vanchit nar-naariyon kaa mandabudhiyon ke kalyaan ke liye attharah puraanon kii rachana kii, taaki ve bhi dharm-paalan main samarth ho saken
 Sutji said - Mahatma! According to Guruji's responsibility, the responsibility of spreading and propagating seventeen Puranas came upon me, but the Bhog and Mokshadata Bhagavata Purana itself was narrated by Guruji to Janmejaya
 aap jaanate hai-janmejay ke pita raja parakshit ko takshak sarp ne das liya tha or raja ne apni hatya ke kalyaan ke liye shrimad bhagwat puraana kaa shravan kiya tha
 The king worshiped Lokmata Bhagwati Durga for nine days continuously and listened to the full Bhagavata Purana with the glory of Lokmata from the mouth of Muni Ved Vyasa
 sutaji ne kaha-mahatman! guruji ke aadeshaanusaar satraa puraanon ke prasar evam prachaar kaa daayitv mujh par aayaa, kintu bhoga or mokshadaata bhagwat puraana swayan guruji ne janmejay ko sunaaya
 You know - Janmejaya's father Raja Parikshit was bitten by the Takshak serpent and the king listened to Srimad Bhagavat Purana for the welfare of his murder
 raja ne nau din nirantar lokmata bhagwati durga kii puja-aradhana kii tathaa muni vedavyas ke mukh se lokmata kii mahima se purna bhagwat puraana kaa shravan kiya
 Sri Krishna was lost in an attempt to find Prasenjit who returned safely with the blessings of Sri Devi Bhagwati
 yah vrittant maharishiyon kii ichha se vistaar se sunaate hue shri sutaji kehane lage-sajjanon ! bahut pehle dwarka puri main bhojavanshi raja satrajit rahata tha
 Due to the devotion and worship of the Sun, he received a very bright gem named Swamantak
 mani kii kranti se raja swayan surya jaisaa prabhaa-mandit ho jaataa tha
 In this confusion, when the Yadavas spoke to Shri Krishna about the arrival of Lord Surya, then Antaryami Krishna, while removing the doubts of the Yadavas, said that the upcoming nobleman Maniadhari king is Satrajit, not Surya
 swamantak mani kaa gun tha ki usko dhaaran karne vaala pratidin aath kilo swarna praapt karegaa
 There was no sign of any kind of human or divine calamity in that region
 swamantak mani praapt karne kii ichha swayan krishna ne bhi kii lekin satrajit ne asweekaar kar diya
 Once Satrajit's brother Prasenjit, wearing the gem, went on a horse and went hunting, then a lion killed him
 sanyog se jamavant naamak rich ne singh ko hi maar daalaa or vah mani ko lekar apni gupha main aa gaya
 Jamwant's daughter started playing with the jewel, thinking it was a toy
 prasenjit ke na lautne par dwarka main yah afvaah fail gai ki krishna ko satrajit dwaara mani dene se inkaar karne par durbhaavnavash krishna ne prasenjit kii hatya kara di or mani par apana adhikaar kar liya
 Unhappy with this rumor, Krishna set out to find Prasenjit
 van main krishna or unke saathiyon ne prasenjit ke saath ek singh ko bhi mara paaya
 They also found signs of bear footprints there, which indicated the entrance into the cave
 isse krishna ne singh ko maarane tathaa mani ke rich ke paas hone kaa anumaan lagaaya
 Krishna himself entered the cave by telling his companions to stay outside and wait
 kaaphi samay baad bhi krishna ke waapas na aane par niraash hokar laute saathi ne krishna ke bhi maare jane kaa mithyaa prachaar kar diya
 On Krishna's return, his father Vasudeva was distressed in his son-mourning
 usee samay maharishi naarad aa gaye
 Knowing the news, Naradji preached to Vasudeva to listen to Shrimad Devi Bhagavata Purana
 vasudev maa bhagwati kii krupa se purv parichit the
 He told Naradji - Devarshi, while imprisoned with Devaki, when the six sons were killed at the hands of Kansa, both of our husbands and wives became very upset and upset
 tab apane kul purohit maharishi garg se paraamarsh kiya or ksht se chhutkaaraa paane kaa upaay poocha
 Gurudev asked to parade the saga of Jagadamba Maa
 karagaar main hone ke kaaran mere liye yah sambhav nahin tha
 Therefore, prayed to Gurudev to get this work done
 vasudev ne kaha-meri prarthana sweekaar karke gurudev ne vindhyachal parvat par jaakar brahmanon ke saath devi kii aradhana-archana kii
 Performed a Navagna sacrifice of Goddess Bhagwat by law
 anushthan purna hone par gurudev ne mujhe isaki soochna dete hue kaha-devi ne prasann hokar yah akashwani kii he-meri prerana se swayan vishnu prithvi ke ksht nivaaran hetu vasudev devaki ke ghar avatar lenge
 Vasudev should bring that child to the house of nand-yashoda of Gokul village and bring the girl of Yashoda born at the same time and hand it to Kamsa as the eighth child
 kansa yathavat balika ko dharti par patake degaa
 That girl will immediately leave Kansa's hand and wear a celestial body, part of me will dwell on the Vidhyanchal mountain for public welfare
 garg muni ke dwaara is anushthan fal ko sun kar maine prasannataa vyakt karte hue aage ghati ghatnaayen muni ke kathananusaar puri kin or krishna kii raksha kii
 After narrating this description, Vasudev said to Naradji - Muniver! Fortunately, your arrival has proved beneficial for me
 at: aap hi mujhe devi bhagwat puraana kii katha sunaakar upakrit karen
 At the behest of Vasudeva, Narada graciously performed Navahra Parine
 vasudev ne nawein din katha samaapti par naradji kii puja-archana kii bhagwati maa kii maaya se shrikrishna jab gupha main pravisht hue to unhone ek balika ko mani se khelte dekha
 As soon as Krishna took the gem from the girl, the girl wept
 balika ke rone kii aawaaj ko sunakar jamavant vahaan aa pahunchaa tathaa krishna se yuddh karne laga
 The war lasted for twenty-seven days in both
 devi kii krupa se jamavant lagaataar camoger padataa gaya tathaa shrikrishna shakti-sampann hote gaye
 In the end he defeated Jamwant
 bhagwati kii krupa se jamavant ko purv smriti ho ai
 Rama, who killed Ravana in Treta, worshiped him considering that he incarnated as Krishna in the copper age
 agyaan main kiye aparaadh ke liye kshamaa maangi
 Along with Mani, his daughter Jambavati was also happily dedicated to Krishna
 mathura main katha ke samaapt hone ke baad vasudev brahman bhoj ke baad aashirwad le rahe the, usee samay krishna mani or jambavati ke saath vahaan pahuch gaye
 There was no limit to the happiness of everyone seeing Krishna there
 bhagwati kaa aabhaar prakat karte hue vasudev-devaki ne shrikrishna kaa ashrupurit netron se swaagat kiya
 Narada returned to Devaloka after making a successful work of Vasudev
 devi bhagwat puraana ke anusaar aagat muniyon ko yah katha sunaate hue sutaji bole-shradwalu rishiyon ! katha shravan ke liye shraddhalu janon ko shubh muhoort nikalwane ke liye kisi jyotirvid se salaah leni chahie yaa phir navaratri main hi yah katha-shravan upyukt he
