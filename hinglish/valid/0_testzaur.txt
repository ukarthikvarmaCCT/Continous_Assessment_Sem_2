 Sometimes martial law is imposed in that area during war or after winning an area

 Often a tribunal of the army is appointed to give justice under martial law called a court martial
 iske antargat bandi pratyakshikaran yachika jaise adhikaar nilambit kiye jate hai
 Military law, on the one hand, implies the confession of the government that a situation has arisen in a country or region, especially when it is necessary to face the force with strength, so they should have such unusual rights in their hands which they can use during the period of crisis
 In the internal zone of the country, in this situation, instead of the process of the courts, only the orders of the executive or military administrator can be made The recognition is received
 duusari ore faujee kanoon ek kanoonee pratyay kaa vichaar he, jiske dwaara naagarik nyaayalayon ne un asaadhaaran adhikaron ke niyantran kaa praytn kiya he jo karypalika dwaara rajya ke nagarikon par lagu karne ke liye adhigruhit kiye jate hai
 Thus military law is different from military law, which is the special law governing armed forces
 naagarik adhikaar ke prayog ke hetu jab sashastr sena se kaam liya jaataa he tab sena naagarik adhikariyon ke niyantran main hi apana kaary karti he or aparaadhiyon par saadhaaran nyaayalayon main vichaar hota he
 But in military law, the powers of civil officers and courts are suspended and criminals are prosecuted before the army commission
 englad main samrat ko sankatkaal ghoshit karne kaa adhikaar nahin he, kintu yuddh ke samay karypalika ko sansadeey vidhaan ke antargat tathaa tadnurup adhiniyamon ke antargat anek vyavasthaayen tathaa aadesh prasaarit karne ke vyapkadhikaar praapt ho jate hai
 Nevertheless, the exercise of those rights takes place under the dual control of the Legislature and the Court
 amareeki vidhi main raashtrapati ko, congressi karrwai se swatantra, faujee kanoon ghoshit karne kaa kahan tak adhikaar he or us sthiti main vidhayika tathaa nyaayalayon dwaara kahan tak niyantran kiya ja saktaa he, yah ab bhi vivaad kaa vishay he tathaa is maamle main kanoonee sthiti ab bhi spasht nahin he
 In India too, in the absence of a clear constitutional directive, it is controversial who is entitled to declare a military law
 faujee kanoon sambandhi ullekh keval 34veen dhara main he, jo kisi vishesh kshetra main faujee kanoon uthaa liye jane ke baad kshatipurti adhinium kii vyavastha karti he
 But similar to military law, the President has the right under Section 359 to suspend judicial execution of the rights under Section 21 and 22
 yah samajha jaataa he ki yah mulat: faujee kanoon kaa hi rup he, kintu prathit hota he ki sarvocch nyaayalay ne ise vivaad ke liye chhod diya he jo ho, is sambandh main koi bhi mat apanaaya jaae, samvidhan kii dhara 352 ke antargat sankatkaal kii ghoshnaa kaa moulik adhikaron par prabhaav newnaadhik maatra main faujee kanoon jaisaa hi he
 Thus, as long as the crisis situation persists under section 358, the executive has the right to violate the provisions of section 19
 raashtrapati dwaara dhara 359 ke antargat sankatkalin avadhi tak yaa aadesh main ullikhit avadhi tak ke liye duusare moulik adhikaar bhi sthagit kiye ja sakate hai
 There is only so much control over the authority of the President that the declaration of crisis must be presented to Parliament for approval
 is ghoshnaa ko sansad ke samaksh prastut karne kii koi nishchit avadhi nahin hoti or na prastut kiye jane par kisi prakaar kaa dand kaa pravidhan hi he, kintu ghoshnaa ke prasaarit hone ke do maas pashchaat vah swat: samaapt ho jaati he
 There is no restriction on the President when one declaration ends and then another is issued
 dhara 359 ke antargat jari kiya gaya raashtrapati kaa aadesh sansad ke samaksh yathashighra prastut hona chahie
 It is left to the executive to decide the time of this presentation because even if the President's order is not presented before the Parliament, its effect is not reduced nor is there any system of legal action in the absence of submission
 san 1962 ke chini akraman ke dauraan, raashtrapati ne samvidhan kii 14, 21 or 22 dharao kaa nishpaadan sthagit karke sankatkalin sthiti kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The public was severely criticized for the excessive delay in announcing the declaration, even after the situation became quite normal
 is tathy ne sankatkalin adhikaron ke sambandh main kuch or sangrakshan lagane kii aavashyaktaa pragat kar di he, kyonki aisa na hone par koi bhi aviveki karyaadhikari apni suvidha ke liye samvidhan kaa unmoolan karke faujee kanoon ko sthaayee kar de saktaa he
 We have not yet forgotten that Weimar Constitution of Germany, according to which various kinds of tips were resorted to in order to not let the legal rule become permanent
 bharat main bhi is prakaar kii sambhaavnaaon ke prati udasin rahanaa uchit na hoga

 Voicemail was invented by Gerald M
 Kolodny and Paul Hughes when they described it in an article in a medical journal called "radiology"
 
 “radiology” 1974, 111 :717-9) colodni or hughes ne ek patent ke liye 1975 main aavedan kiya, jise 1981 main aavantit kiya gaya 
 yah patent masachusets ke sudbari systams ko saunpa gaya jisane aisi pranaaliyon ko bazaar main laane or nigamon or aspataalon ko bechney kaa kaary shuru kiya
 IBM, Sony and Lennier and several smaller manufacturers of voicemail systems obtained Sudbury patent licenses for their voicemail systems
 pitni bowes dwaara kiye gaye ek patent daawey ko, jisamen sudbari patent se pehle kalatmak prastuti kaa daawa kiya gaya tha, america ke jila nyaayalay, connectikat jila dwaara 8 navambar 2000 ko asweekrut kar diya gaya
 In the 1970s and early 1980s, the cost of making a phone call was reduced and more business communication was carried out by phone
 jaise-jaise nigamon kaa vikaas hua or shram daren badhin, karmchaariyon or sachivon ke bich anupaat kam hone laga
 With multiple time zones, a decrease in the number of secretaries and more communication over the phone, the real-time phone-communication practice began to be hampered by the callers not being able to contact people
 Some preliminary studies showed that only 1 out of 4 calls were resulting in a complete call and half of the calls were one-sided
 aisa hone kaa kaaran logon kaa us samay kaam par na hona, yaa kaam par maujuud rahane par bhi apni kaarysthal se hatakar baithkon main vyast rahanaa yaa vishram par hona aadi the
 This barrier inhibited the impact of business activities and was the cause of both individual and group productivity
 isse phone karne vaale kaa samay bhi barbaad hota tha or samay par nirbhar mahatvapurn muddon ko hal karne main vilamb hota tha
 Neither email messaging nor cellular phones were widely in use in the 1970s and 1980s and their development did not actually begin until the mid-1990s
 vyavsaayon ke liye phone sanchaar samasya kaa praarambhik samaadhaan "sandesh kendra" tha
 a message center or "message desk" was a centralized hand-operated answering service offered by some employees answering the phones of every person in a company
 vyast rahane vaale yaa koi jawaab na dene vaale ekstansion sandesh kendra ke jariye "kol nirdeshak" naamak ek upkaran par antarit ho jate the
 The call director had a button for each extension of the company, which began to glow when the person's extension was sent to the message center
 batan ke paas laga ek label oparator ko batalaata tha ki vah ekstansion kiskaa he
 While this was an improvement over earlier systems, the message center was quite inconvenient
 oparator vyast the or kaalon kii sankhya sheershakaal kii avadhiyon jaise dopaher ke bhojan ke samay bad jaati thim
 Due to this, the employees who took the message had very little time to take each message correctly
 aksar, ve karmchaariyon ke naamon yaa unke uccharan se parichit bhi nahin hote the
 The messages were written on pink leaflets and distributed by the internal mail system
 sandesh aksar lambii deree ke baad logon kii mej par pahonchte the, un par phone karne vaale kaa naam or number ke alaava bahut kam jaankaree hoti thi or ve akasar galat naamon or phone nambaron sahit trutipurna hote the
 Tape-based telephone answering machines had arrived in the residential telephone market, but were not used much in the corporate environment due to the physical limitations of the technology
 har telephone ke liye ek alag uttar dene vaali mashin kii jarurat thi; yadi upyogkarta phone kaa istemaal kar rahaa ho to sandeshon ko ricard nahin kiya ja saktaa tha; sandeshon ko anukramik kram se hi waapas nikaala ja saktaa tha or sandeshon ko duurastha rup se praapt, chun kar nikaala, bachaaya yaa anya logon tak agreshit nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 In addition, manufacturers of pbxs used proprietary digital phone sets to increase the functionality and value of pbxs
 ye phone set, jaanboojh kar, uttar dene vaali mashiinon ke saath asangat banaae jate the

 Watson Research Center
 iskaa uddheshy email kii avadharana kii nakal karnaa tha, lekin iske liye telephone kaa prayog input upkaran ke rup main or maanav swar kaa prayog sandesh ke liye madhyam ke rup main kiya gaya tha
 Work on the system began in 1973 and the first operator prototype was made available to users in 1975
 ek baar main chaar log iskaa istemaal kar sakate the
 From 1975 to 1981, about 750 IBM executives, mainly from the US, used the SFS prototype in their daily work
 ye prototip atirikt bhandaaran ke liye ek ibiem viem370 se judi ek ibiem pranali / 7 computaron par kaary karte the
 This prototype was modified in 1978 to run on a Series / 1 computer
 sitambar 1981 main, ibiem ne is utpaada kii "audio vitaran pranali" ke rup main ghoshnaa kii, jisaki pratham graahakeey sthapana farvari 1982 main kii gai
 It was marketed directly by IBM and briefly by AT&T
 ibiem ke adies ko ek computer kii tarah vishesh dhyaan kii aavashyaktaa hoti thi
 As a result of ibm's heavy research into human factors and the study of SFS in actual operational experimentation, abundant facilities were provided for voice messaging in ADS
 lekin, adies kii kuch khaas pramukh simaaen thim jiske kaaran vah ek vyavsaayik utpaada ke rup main vifal ho gaya: udhaaharan ke liye, vah aakaar main bada, mahangaa or 1000 prayogkartaaon tak simit tha, usamen telephone par uttar dene kii koi suvidha nahin thi or prayogkarta data base main prashasnic parivartan karne ke liye kaary roak dena padataa tha
 Another company, Delphi Communications of California, deserves some partial credit for the invention of voicemail
 je stopher ke netritv main, delphi ne ek aisi pranali kaa vikaas kiya, jo sidhe telephone company se aane vaali kol uthaa leti thi
 Stauffer introduced the Delphi concept publicly to the organization of Telephone Responsive Services around 1973, and its prototype system was launched in San Francisco in 1976 by a Delphi company called voicebank
 delphi ne delta 1 ko vyavsaayon or peshewaron ke liye graahak telephonon kaa jawaab dene vaali ek vishuddh seva-unmukh swar sandesh-vaahak pranali ke rup main viksit kiya
 Delta 1 required human intervention to submit the message
 haalanki teen mashiinon kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha, unamem se sirf ek hi mashin ko sanchaalak seva main liya gaya tha
 The fully automated voice conveyor system was developed in 1981 for initial operator use in Los Angeles
 jaahir taur par delta 2 ko banaaya, lagaaya or thode se samay ke liye parichaalit to kiya gaya tha, lekin durbhaagya se delphi kaa pramukh niveshak, exaan enterpriceez july, 1982 ko achaanak band ho gaya
 Nothing further was done with Delphi's technique
 delphi kii swachaalit telephone swar seva pranali ke liye ek patent ke liye aavedan kiya gaya jise jari kar diya gaya tha
 This patent, named US Patent Number 4,625,081, was issued after Delphi's closure, but Delphi's assets were transferred to another Exxon company, Gilbarco, which manufactured equipment for gas pumps at gas filling stations
 gilbarco kaa swaamitv ab united kingdom kii jiisi ke paas he
 In 1979, five years after ibm's SFS system and three years after Delphi's Delta 1 system was first commissioned, a company called ECS Communications was founded by Gordon Matthews in Texas
 delphi sanchaar ke sansthaapak jo stopher ke anusaar, gordon maitheus ko viemex kii sthapana karne ke pehle se delphi ke dhwani mail ke bare main jaankaree thi
 However inspired he was, Matthew eventually founded VMX, which developed a 3000-user voice messaging system called VMX / 64
 viemex yakeenan pehali company thi jisane korporate prayog ke liye vyavsaayik bikri ke liye dhwani mail kii peshkash kii thi
 Matthews was successful in selling his system to several notable corporations such as 3M, Codec, American Express, Intel, halfman-la-roche, Corning Glass, Arco, Shell Canada, and Westinghouse
 Made corporate voicemail with this impressive list of initial acceptors
 Started Some claim that VMX and Gordon Matthews invented voicemail, but this claim is not true

 Although VMX had made a good start, it failed to develop the market and the company was not a commercial success

 In addition, the user interface was confusing, requiring users to remember non-intuitive multi-digit touch-tone instructions
 maitheus, jo ek vipul udhyami or patentr tha, ne dhwani mail par patent ke liye aavedan kiya tha jo farvari 1983 main jari kiya gaya
 This patent was promoted as the leading patent for voicemail
 pratham dhwani mail pranaaliyon ke vikaas ke fouran baad, vaing leboratorys, aroelem, opcom, ocktail, centigram, jenesis or kai anya companiyaan apni swayan kii pranaaliyon ko viksit karne ke liye uth khadi huin
 dow laire berjiron ke netritv main, vaing leboratorys ne ibiem pranali par aadhaarit ek dhwani mail pranali kaa vikaas kiya
 Wang named his system DVX
 yah bhi baahar se aane vaali kaalon kaa jawaab nahin de sakati thi, lekin ibiem pranali kii tulana main choti or kam mahangi thi
 Matthews used his patent quite cleverly
 usne ibiem, anti and tii or phir vaing ke saath apane patent kaa daawa karne kii koshish kii, lekin teenon hi companiyaan kathith taur par purv kala ke aadhaar par maitheus ke patent ko amaanya karne main sakasham thim
 Matthews cleverly secured an agreement that allowed his patent to remain intact without challenge in court, and IBM, Wang and AT&T obtained royalty-free licenses for all VMX patents
 Wang, the last major company to obtain such a license, essentially paid $ 20,000 and cross-licensed some patent applications
 ibiem or anti and tii ne bhi kai patenton ko viemex ko cross-license kar diya, jinamein se adhikansh aprachlit yaa puraane the
 VMX got a chance to claim that many big companies had licensed its patents, but it did not tell them not to take anything
 The patent was never challenged in court, and VMX continued to claim that it had invented voicemail and that Mathews was the father of voicemail
 vaing ke saath samjhaute ke baad, viemex ne ocktail ke saath samjhauta kiya
 In return for a small payment and Octel agreed that it would not sue for any VMX patent, Octel received a pre-paid royalty-free license for all current and future VMX patents
 aroelem apane phonmel, jo ek panjikrut trademark he, naamak utpaada ke jariye ekikrut dhwani mail kii peshkash karne vaali pehali company thi
 phonemail offered impressive recording quality of its digital messages
 rolm's digital PBX was the first PBX to indicate which extension was being sent to the voicemail system
 lekin, sanketan kriya malikana thi or keval uske dhwani mail utpaada, phonmel dwaara istemaal ke iraade se hi banaai gai thi
 rolm's CBX also facilitated signaling functions to enable phonemail to burn the waiting message light, on standard phones equipped with rolm's electronic phones and later waiting message lights
 phonemail worked with not all of rolm's cbixes, but most models and other brands of pbxs such as Nortel's Option Meridian and was widely promoted by ROLM
 phonmel abhi bhi ek vyavsaayik safalataa he
 Siemens still offers phonemail and its integrated messaging successor, Expressions 470, in various configurations / sizes; That too with the same catchy feminine voice that ROLM technicians have fondly nicknamed "silicon Sally"
 david lead dwaara shuru kii gai ek company, opcom dhwani mail kii ek or nirmaataa company thi jisane swachaalit parichar kii suvidha kaa nirmaan kiya or use patent karavaaya 
 swachaalit parichar, takneekee rup se dhwani mail nahin he, lekin swachaalit parichar ko sakasham karne ke liye sabhi suvidhaayen pehle se hi ek dhwani mail pranali kaa hissaa hai, jisase uskaa isamen joda janaa ek prakritik suvidha he
 Despite the Opcom patents, automated attendant features were implemented before 1985 in a commercial teradine product
 opcom ne mukhyatah chote udhyamon ko vipanan karne ke liye ek dhwani mail pranali viksit kii he
 The automatic attendant enables him to call directly using the single digit key
 udhaaharan ke liye, "agar aap gharelu aarakshan karvaa rahe hai to '1' dabaaen; antararashtriya aarakshan ke liye '2' dabaaen; akasar udaan bharne waalon kii jaankaree ke liye '3' dabaaen, aadi"
 opcom ek abhinav company thi or usne ekikrut sandesh kii avadharana kaa bhi avishkaar kiya tha 
 opcom kaa dhwani mail utpaada choti companiyon or katipay badi companiyon ke saath vyavsaayik rup se safal rahaa
 1991 ke aasapaas, viemex diwaliyapan ke kagaar par tha or opcom dwaara uskaa adhigrahan kar liya gaya
 Since Opcom was private and VMX public property, the transaction was done as a reverse merger and the remaining company was named VMX
 mul viemex company kaa thodaa sa hissaa hi shesh rahaa
 Octel Communications Corporation was founded in 1982 in Silicon Valley by Bob Kohn and Peter Olson
 octel kii dhwani mail pranali ne kaaphi jaldi bazaar ke bade hisse par kabja kar liya
 While Octel benefited from the hard work and experimentation of others, it was the first independent voicemail company to build a strong business and strategy to overcome this important market
 iske alaava, octel ne kaaphi abhinav takneekon kaa avishkaar kiya jisase uski safalataa main baari yogadan mila
 octel kii vibhedit hardware or software vaastukala ne uski pranaaliyon ko aakaar main chota, tej, adhik bharosemand or utpaadan karne main anya vikritaon kii tulana main kaaphi kam laagat kaa bana diya
 in suvidhaon ne, jinamein se kai ko patent karaayaa gaya tha, octel ko bazaar main netritv pradaan kiya: Octel's strategy met the needs of key accounts that did not come to the attention of other vendors much later: advanced training, customer service, sales and market education
 Octel's system could illuminate the extension numbers for calls coming from it and the message-waiting lights of most pbxs
 aisa isaliye sambhav tha kyonki octel ke ejiniyaron ne pibiexon ke pramukh brandon ko ulti disha main ejeeniyar kiya tha or pibiex dwaara sanchaar karne ke aise nae tareeke khoje the jo pibiex nirmaataa nahin kar paae the
 Ultimately, most manufacturers of PBX decided to work with Octel
 octel ne duniya bhar main pibiex ke lagbhag 100 brandon ke saath ekikaran kiya
 As a result of Octel's worldwide leadership, its user interface became the most popular in the world
 1990 ke dashak ke ant main, octel ne drishy melbox or ekikrut sandeshprakriya kii avadharana kii prastuti kii
 drishy melbox ne upyogkartaaon ko apane nijee computaron ke madhyam se apane swar melboxon kaa prabandhan karne kii kshamta pradaan kii, haalanki sandesh tab bhi octel pranali par hi sangrahit kiye jate the
 Unified Messaging integrated voicemail with Microsoft Exchange, the corporate email system created by Microsoft
 ekikrut sandeshprakriya kaa avishkaar vastav main anti and tii bel labs main roberta kohen, kenneth hubar or debora mil dwaara kiya gaya tha
 The patent for Unified Messaging was issued in June 1989
 ekikrut sandeshpranali : ekikrut sandeshprakriya ke jariye, upyogkarta apane nijee computer par yaa to graphical yujar interphes kaa prayog karke, yaa duniya main kisi bhi telephone ke saath telephone upyogkarta interfes kaa prayog karke swar or email sandesh praapt kar sakate the
 On a personal computer, users could view voicemails and emails mixed together in their email inbox
 dhwani melon main ek chote se telephone kaa chinh or email ke bagal main ek chote se lipaphe kaa chinh bana hota tha 
 dhwani mail ke liye, unhen "header soochna" dikhaai detii thi 
 upyogkarta apane email inbox se dhwani mail ko do baar clic karke apane nijee computer yaa apni mej ke paas maujuud phone ke madhyam se sandesh sun sakate the
 Using any phone in the world, users were able to listen to voice messages in a normal way as well as have their emails read
 dhwani sandeshon ko email yaa phone- sambodhi yojanaon kaa prayog karke bheja ja saktaa tha or data netwarking buniyadi suvidhaon kaa prayog saarvajanik telephone swichit network ke bajaay sthanon ke bich sandesh bhejne ke liye kiya jane laga
 Unified messaging was not a commercial success in those days, as email did not receive a large share of the market until the late 1990s
 email ke sarwar kuch khaas vishwasaneey nahin the, internet conection dhime the or adhikansh nijee computaron main spikar yaa microphone nahin the
 Until 1988, telephone companies and newly formed cellular phone companies were legally prohibited from offering voicemail to their customers
 aisa epasisi dwaara desh bhar ke telephone pratyuttar vyavsaayon kii raksha karne ke liye kiya gaya tha
 This prohibition continued in 1984 with the order that disbanded AT&T
 7 march 1988 ko herold ech
 green dwaara diye gaye ek nirnay ke baad yah nishedh hataa liya gaya
 Phone companies were allowed to offer voicemail as a service, but were prohibited from designing or building machines that provided service
 viemex kii vishaal pranali kaa prayog kuch hi vaahakon dwaara kiya ja rahaa tha, lekin vishwasaneeyata or laagat ke gambhir muddon ke kaaran viemex ko vaahak bazaar main vistaar karne main baadha kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 octel ke paas korporate upyog ke liye pehle se hi bahut adhik kshamta vaali pranaliyaan thim or 1988 tak sabhi saat kshetreey bel aaparating companiyaan aantarik upyog ke liye octel kaa prayog kar rahi thim
 Octel first optimized its largest system for carriers, giving them the ability to provide reliable voicemail to their customers
 ek saal ke bheetar, octel ne apni badi pranali kii ek nai peedi kii bazaar main peshkash kii, jo "enibies maanakon", jo phone companiyon dwaara unke kendriya karyaalayon main sthit kisi bhi upkaran ke liye aavashyak maanak the, kaa anusaran karne vaale vaahakon ke liye vishesh rup se dizin kii gai thi
 Some other manufacturers, including Unisys, Boston Technology and Comverse Technology, entered the voicemail market for carriers
 in vikritaon ne nigamon ko dhwani mail kii peshkash nahin kii, balki sambhavit bade or aakarshak vaahak bazaar par dhyaan kendrit kiya
 Unisys acquired the rights to provide Pacbel's residential voicemail services, and Boston Technology was the mainstay of Bell Atlantic's residential voicemail offering
 anya korporate dhwani mail nirmaataaon main se kisi ko bhi vaahak bazaar main ullekhneey safalataa nahin mili, kyonki unki pranaaliyon kii kshamta bahut kam thi or upkaran paryaapt rup se bharosemand nahin the
 Different methods of sales and marketing were required to sell to carriers than to sell to the corporate market, and only Octel was successful in both
 uttari america main apane graahakon ko dhwani mail kii safaltaapurvak peshkash karne vaala pehla vaahak shaayad bel cellular tha, jo ontario or quebec ko seva pradaan karne vaala kenadian vaahak tha 
 dhwani mail ke saath bel cellular kii safalataa ne jor pakad liya or cellular dhwani mail sampurna canada or phir america or videshon main fail gaya
 Within a few years, 100 percent of Canadian cellular companies eventually started using octal voicemail, after which almost all major US wireless carriers and a large percentage of GSM carriers worldwide began using it
 Comverse Technology was very successful in the GSM market outside the US
 octel upyogkarta interfes duniya bhar main adhikansh vaahakon ke saath sabase aam ho gaya lekin, prayek vaahak ne antarfalak par maamuli badlaav kiye
 The carrier market led to the development of other interesting markets including a concept called "virtual telephony"
 octel dwaara viksit abhaasi telephoni ne dhwani mail kaa istemaal ubharate deshon main betaar telephone seva teji se uplabdh karaane ke liye kiya
 This solved the problem of not having more telephones in emerging countries
 telephone ke liye taar lagaana bahut mahangaa tha or kai garib nagarikon ke paas taar lagavane ke liye ghar hi nahin the
 Wiring for telephones was very expensive and poor many citizens did not have homes to wire
 ubharate deshon kii arthvyavasthaaen aanshik rup se isaliye viksit nahin ho rahi thim kyonki log us kshetra ke daayre se baahar sanchaar nahin kar sakate the, jahaan ve keval paidal chal sakate yaa cycle hi chalaa sakate the
 Providing phones to them was one way to improve their economies, but that method was not practical there
 kuch deshon main, ek phone ke liye kai saalon tak pratiksha kerani padati thi or uski laagat kai hajaar dollaron tak main thi
 At that time cellular phones were not a suitable option as they were very expensive and the infrastructure required to set up cell sites was also expensive
 abhaasi telephoni ke dwaara, prayek vyakti ko ek phone number or ek dhwani melbox diya ja saktaa tha
 a pager could also be given to the citizen
 jab koi us phone number par phone karata tha, to uski ghanti kisi vaastavik phone par kabhi nahin bajati thi, balki turant ek kendriya dhwani mail pranali tak le jaai jaati thi
 The voicemail system answered that call and the caller could leave a long, detailed message
 jaise hi sandesh praapt hota tha, dhwani mail pranali naagarik ke pager ko sakriy kar detii thi
 On receiving the information, the citizen used to search for a pay-phone and used to call to get the message
 is avadharana kaa istemaal dakshin america or dakshin africa main safaltaapurvak kiya gaya
 In the early 1980s, more than 30 companies competed for the corporate voicemail market, many of which are no longer trading
 iske anekon daavedaaron main ibiem, viemex, vaing, octel, anti and tii, uttari telecom, delphi sanchaar, wais and data systams, opcom, comatarm, jenesis, bruke trout, glenare, bibiel, evity, aviasti, digital sound, centigram, waisamel international, active wais or kai anya shaamil the
 Almost all the contenders of the corporate voicemail market were located in the United States
 1990 ke dashak ke ant tak ibiem or vaing dhwani mail bazaar se baahar ho gaye, kyonki unhen paryaapt karshan nahin mil sakaa
 aroelem ko 1980 ke dashak ke madhya main ibiem dwaara kharid liya gaya or phir uski aadhi hissedari german company cemens ko bech di gai
 In 1992, Siemens bought ROLM completely from IBM and stopped making all of rolm's core products except phonemail)
 VMX faced wrong product and ineffective management and was about to close when Opcom merged with it
 shesh bachi hui company kaa naam viemex rakhaa gaya, lekin viemex ko uske naam or patent portpholio ko chhod kar opcom dwaara puri tarah se mitaa diya gaya
 In 1994, Octel purchased VMX
 90 ke dashak ke prarambh main, anti and tii / lucent ne korporate bazaar ke liye dhwani mail kaa apana ek sanskaran banaaya, lekin vah keval anti and tii / lucent ke pibiexon par hi kaam kar saktaa tha
 Nortel developed Meridian Mail and followed a similar strategy to AT&T according to which Meridian Mail only worked with Northern Telecom pbxs
 parinamswaroop kisi bhi company ko bade rashtriya yaa bahurashtriya khaaton kaa koi vishesh bazaar-hissaa praapt nahin ho sakaa 
 anti and tii ne apane upkaran vyavsaay ko lucent technologys naamak company main badal diya or nordarn telecom ne apana naam badal kar nortel kar liya
 Many small companies offering voicemail were shut down due to inadequate product or management
 1990 ke dashak ke madhya tak, octel nigamon or vaahakon donon ke liye dhwani mail kaa pehle darje kaa sambharak ban gaya tha
 It had a market share of 60% of the US, Canada, Europe and Japan, and between 30% and 100% of the carrier market by country
 1997 tak octel ke bade pratiyogiyon main lucent dwaara nirmit audix or nortel dwaara nirmit meridian mail the
 In July 1997, Octel was purchased by Lucent Technology
 lucent ke audix vibhaag ko octel main vilay karke octel sandeshprakriya vibhaag banaaya gaya
 In the same year, Boston Technology was acquired by Comverse Technology making it the second largest supplier of carriers after Octel
 kuch hi varshon main comvars vaahakon kaa sabase bada sambharak ban gaya or lucent ne korporate bazaar main apana netritv banaae rakhaa or vaahakon ke saath duusare sthaan par rahaa
 2000 tak, kuch logon kaa anumaan he ki octel sandeshprakriya vibhaag dwaara banaae gaye korporate or vaahak dhwani mail ke 150,000,000 se adhik sakriy upyogkarta the
 Shortly thereafter, Lucent changed its corporate business into a company called Avaya, including the Octel messaging division
 Today, Comverse continues to lead the legacy voicemail systems sold to carriers worldwide
 ypi par aadhaarit dhwani mail pranaaliyon ke liye arikson apane arikson ypi-par-sandeshprakriya samaadhaan ke saath bazaar kaa netaa hone kaa daawa karata he
 By the year 2000, voicemail had become a ubiquitous feature on phone systems serving companies, cellular and residential customers
 cellular or awasaiya dhwani mail apane purv rup main, mukhya rup se saral telephone pratyuttareekaran ke rup main, aaj bhi jari he
 Email had become the prevalent messenger system, email servers and software had become quite reliable and almost all office workers were equipped with multimedia desktop personal computers
 dhwani main twarit sandeshvaahan : sandeshprakriya main agali ghatana bajaay keval sandesh kaa atulykaalik sangrah karne or aage badhaakar melbaks main pahunchaane ke, vaastavik-samay main paath sandesh bananaa tha
 It started as a public Internet-based free-text chat service for consumers by Internet service provider America Online, but soon began to be used by business people as well
 isane internet protocol "upasthiti prabandhan" kii avadharana yaa internet se upkaran kii connactivity ko pahchaanane kaa kshamta or sandesh praptakarta ke uplabdh hone par vaastavik samay main sandeshon ke vinimay kii prastuti kii or iske saath hi yah vyaktigat "mitron kii suchi” nirdeshikaayen bana kar keval un logon ko jinhen aap jaanate hai, aapaki sthiti jaanane or aapke saath ek vaastavik-samay kaa paath-sandesh ke vinimay kii anumati dene kii kshamta pradaan karata he
 Presence and instant messaging have now evolved beyond small text-messaging, but now include the exchange of data files and converting contacts into a voice-to-speech connection
 wireles gatishiltaa main vruddhi bhi, mul rup se cellular sevaaon ke jariye or aajkal ypi par aadhaarit vaai-faai ke madhyam se, mobile telephoni ke saath sandeshon ke abhisaran kaa ek kaaran thi
 Today it is not only promoting the use of interactive user interfaces for message management, but also increasing demand for retrieval of voice messages integrated with email
 yah logon ko aawaaj or email sandeshon, donon kaa jawaab paath kii jagah swar main dene ke liye sakasham karata he
 New services such as gotvoice, Spinvox, and umail are helping to blur the boundaries between voicemail and text by sending voicemails to mobile phones in the form of SMS text-messaging
 wais over ypi kaa ijad hone or viraasati pibiex telephoni ke sthaan par ypi telephoni anuprayogon kaa vikaas hone tak korporate dhwani mail main koi khaas parivartan nahin aayaa
 IP telephony changed the style and technology of pbxs and the way voicemail systems are integrated with them
 This resulted in a new generation of integrated messaging, which is likely to be widely popular
 lacheelaapan, prabandhashiltaa, kam laagat, vishwasaneeyata, gati, abhisaran sandesh bhejne kii or upyogkarta kii suvidha ab vahaan sambhav he jahaan vah pehle nahin thi
 This may include internal and inter-enterprise connectivity, mobile connectivity, active application information distribution, and customer-contact applications
 korporate ypi telephoni par aadhaarit dhwani mail sipii market main avaya, cisco systams, adomo, interactive intelegence, nortel, mitel, 3com or aviasti sahit kai vikreta seva pradaan kar rahe hai
 Their marketing strategy will have to meet the need to support multiple types of legacy pbxs and new voice over IP in the way enterprises are moving towards ip-based telecommunications
 ek aisi hi sthiti dhwani mail sarvaron ke liye vaahak bazaar main bhi, jo vartmaan main comvars praudyogiki ke kabje main he or jiskaa kuch bhaag lucent technologies ke paas abhi bhi he, maujuud he
 voip telephony enables centralized, shared servers with remote administration and usage management for corporate clients
 ateet main, vaahakon ne yah vyavsaay kho diya tha kyonki yah bahut mahangaa or phone company dwaara duurastha prabandhit suvidhaayen dene kii drushti se lacheela nahin tha
 With voip, remote administration is far more economical
 is praadyogiki ne vaahakon ke liye ypi-pibiex or dhwani mail sevaaon sahit ypi doorsanchaar ke sabhi prakaaron ke liye mejabanikrut, saajha sevaaon kii peshkash karne ke avasar phir se khol diye hai
 Due to the convergence of wired and wireless communications, such services can now also include a variety of multi-handed handheld and table end user devices
 is seva ko, jab isaki peshkash kai ekstenshnon yaa phone numberon ke liye kii jaati he to kabhi-kabhi ekikrut dhwani mail kaa naam diya jaataa he
 The presentation of voicemail has enabled people to leave long, secure and detailed messages in a natural voice, working with corporate phone systems
 nigamon dwaara dhwani mail kaa upyog karne se sanchaar ke pravaah main sudhaar hua or dhan kii baari maatra main bachat hui
 jeei, jo duniya bhar main apane sabhi karyaalayon main dhwani mail ke agrani upabhoktaaon main se ek he, ne daawa kiya ki dhwani mail prati varsh prati karmchaaree ausatan 1100 dollar kii bachat karwaata he
 Telephone answering and sending voice messages are the two main parts of voicemail
 telephone par jawaab dene vaala bhaag baahar se aane vaali kaal ko jawaab detaa he or kisi bhi baahar phone karne vaale se sandesh letaa he 
 dhwani sandeshprakriya kisi bhi graahak ko anya kisi yaa kai graahakon ke melbaxon ko bina unhen pehle phone kiye sidhe sandesh bhejne main sakasham banaati he
 Both of these tools are described below
 pibiex ke laabhon main se ek uski kaalon ko agreshit karne kii kshamta he
 If a person is using their phone, or does not respond to it, calls going to their extension are automatically sent by the PBX to any other extension, perhaps someone who can answer that call
 Or can take messages, are forwarded
 dhwani mail pranali lagaakar pibiex ko vyast yaa anuttarit ekstenshnon ko aage ek mashin- dhwani mail pranali ko bhejne ke liye kramadeshit kar diya jaataa he
 Suppose an outside caller, Wilma, calls Fred in a company
 yadi fred ke phone kii ghanti "koi jawaab nahin" yaa "vyast" ke rup main bajati he to, pibiex us kol ko aage dhwani mail pranali ko bhej degaa
 pibiex ko kisi bhi tarah se dhwani mail pranali ko yah batalaana hota he ki kol fred ke phone ko agreshit kii ja rahi he taaki dhwani mail pranali fred kii vyaktigat shubhakamana sahit jawaab de sake
 is jaankaree ke bina, dhwani mail pranali ko koi pataa nahin hoga ki vah kiske phone kaa jawaab de rahi thi
 Once you leave a message, the voicemail system stimulates the message light waiting on Fred's phone
 vah aisa pibiex ko ek sanket bhej kar karti he jisase use pataa chalata he ki use koun si batti jalaani he
 When Fred returns to his desk and calls the voicemail system, he is presented with only messages from his personal mailbox, even if thousands of messages about other people are not stored on the same system
 Once the message is heard, the voicemail system prompts the PBX to turn off the waiting message light on Fred's phone
 praarambhik dhwani mail pranaliyaan bahari kaalon kaa jawaab nahin de sakati thim -- yani, ve mulat: pibiex ke kisi ekstansion ko bheji gai kol kaa vyast hone yaa anuttarit rahane par swatah hi jawaab nahin de sakati thi
 With the development of later voicemail systems, it has become possible for systems to respond to calls from outside
 phir bhi, adhikansh pibiex dhwani mail pranali ko sanket nahin dete the ki vah koun se ekstansion kaa agreshan kar rahe hai or na hi ve telephonon par pratiksha kar rahe sandesh kii batti jala kar sahaayta karte the
 This signaling function also became available later, but it was a major challenge for voicemail systems for many years before this became possible
 dhwani sandesh hameshaa hi ek hi dhwani mail pranali par sthit vyaktiyon ke bich bheja janaa jaruri nahin hota
 sandeshon ko eems yaa vioypi praudyogikiyon kaa prayog karke sthanantarit kiya ja saktaa he
 Both these techniques allow messages to be forwarded to the target system on a computer system
 email kii tarah, dhwani sandesh pahunchaane kii yah paddati spam yaa vishing jaise durupyog kaa vishay ho sakati he
 Federal and provincial laws and controls have been enacted to prevent such abuse, such as the United States National "do Not Call" registry
 yah khand bataata he ki mul style kii, akele kaam karne vaali dhwani mail pranali kisi korporate pibiex pranali ke saath kaise kaam karti he
 Its principle is similar to that of central office switches or mobile telephone switching office
 adhiktar aadhunik dhwani mail pranaliyaan isi siddhanth par kaam karti hai, lekin iske kuch bhaag anya pranaaliyon, jaise email pranaaliyon ke saath saajha kiye ja sakate hai
 Voicemail systems have several elements as shown in the figure below: 600px The figure below shows how the voicemail system interacts with the PBX
 kalpana kijiye ki koi bahari collar fred ke ekstansion 2345 par phone kar rahaa he
 Incoming calls come from the public network and arrive at the PBX
 kol ko fred ke ekstansion ko bheja jaataa he, lekin fred jawaab nahin detaa he
 After a certain number of bells, the PBX stops ringing on Fred's extension and forwards the call to an extension connected to the voicemail system
 vah aisa isliye karata he kyonki pibiexon ko aamtaur par vyast yaa anuttarit kaalon ko kisi anya ekstansion kii ore agreshit karne ke liye kramadeshit kiya jaataa he
 Additionally PBX tells the voicemail system that the call extension they are forwarding to voicemail is for Fred at 2345
 is tarah se, dhwani mail pranali fred kii shubhakamana ke saath phone kaa jawaab de sakati he
 There are many microprocessors throughout the system, as the system has to handle large amounts of information and any kind of waiting time is unacceptable
 
 When Fred's extension is forwarded to the voicemail system, the telephone interface detects the ringing of the bell
 vah kendriya procesar ko sanket karata he ki ek kol aa rahi he
 Simultaneously, the pbx-voicemail data link to the CPU indicates that extension 2345 is now being forwarded to the specific extension ringing due to no response when the bell rings
 sipiu telephone interfes ko phone kaa jawaab dene kaa nirdesh detaa he
 When the cpu's program realizes that the call is for Fred, he immediately searches for Fred's greeting and instructs the disk controller to play it to the caller
 vah pranali ke kuch nirdesh bhi sunaata he jiske dwaara collar ko iske baad ke ghatnakramon ke bare main sanket die jate hai
 
 All "conversations" with the caller are done through the prompts selected by the CPU according to the program stored in the voicemail system
 sipiu phone karne vaale vyakti dwaara dabaae gaye batano kii pratikriya ke rup main prampton kaa chayan karata he
 The caller's message is digitized by the telephone interface system and transmitted to a disk controller for storage on message disks
 kuch dhwani mail pranaliyaan adhik suraksha ke liye sandesh ko sphutit kar leti hai
 The CPU then stores the location of that message in the system disk within Fred's mailbox directory entry
 collar ke phone band kar dene or sandesh ke bhandaaran ke baad, sipiu ke link ke madhyam se pibiex ko ek sanket bhejtaa he jisamen vah pibiex ko fred ke phone par sandesh kii pratiksha karne kii batti ko chaalu karne kaa nirdesh detaa he
 When Fred comes back to his desk and sees the light on his phone, he calls an extension number enrolled for the voicemail system
 phir telephone antarfalak sipiu ko sachet karata he ki ek vishesh line par ek kol aa rahi he, lekin is baar pibiex-dhwani mail data link se sanket miltaa he ki fred sidhe kol kar rahaa he, na ki agreshit kiya ja rahaa he
 The CPU instructs the telephone interface to answer the call
 chunki sipiu yah "jaanata" he ki yah fred he, vah pranali ke discs par fred kii jaankaree, vishesh rup se uske password kii khoj karata he
 The CPU then instructs the disk controller to play a log-on prompt for the user: "please enter your password"
 Once the password is entered, the CPU matches it to the correct password and, if entered correctly, allows Fred to continue
 sipiu tab nirdhaarit karata he ki fred ke liye ek nayaa sandesh praapt hua he
 The CPU then presents its options to Fred
 apana nayaa sandesh sunne ke liye, 1 dabaaen, sandesh ko ricard karne ke liye 2 dabaaen aadi) sipiu dwaara discs niyantrak ko prampt bajaane kaa nirdesh dete hue vikalp prastut kiye jate hai or sipiu fred ke sparsh-tonon ko sunata he
 This interaction of prompting and answering with touch-tones helps Fred interact with the voicemail system
 yadi fred apane sandesh ko sunne ke liye 1 dabaata he to sipiu fred kii melbox nirdeshika main nae sandesh kii sthiti kii talash karata he or discs niyantrak ko vah sandesh bajaane kaa nirdesh detaa he
 The disk controller searches for the message on the message disk and sends a data stream directly to the telephone interface

 Lingayatism is a part of the oldest Sanatan Hindu religion of India
 is mat ke zyaadaatar anuyaayi dakshin bharat main hai
 This opinion is based on the worship of Lord Shiva
 bhagwaan shiv jo satya sundar or sanathan hai, jinase sristi kaa udgaar hua, jo aadi anant hai
 In Hinduism, there is a description of the trinity, in which the name of Lord Shiva comes first
 shiv jinase sristi kii utpatti hui
 After this, the origin of Lord Brahma, who gives life to the whole world
 bhagwaan vishnu jo sampoorn jagat ke paalanhaar hai
 The third part is the origin of Lord Mahesh, that is, destroying the liberated souls and re-establishing life in the liberation cycle
 lingayat sampradaay bhagwaan shiv jo ki brahma, vishnu, mahesh, charachar jagat ke utpatti ke kaarak hai unki stuti aradhana karata he
 In other words, you can call them followers of Shaivism
 is sampradaay kii sthapana 12veen shatabdi main mahatma basavannaa ne kii thi
 The worshipers of this religion are called Lingayats
 yah shabd kannada shabd lingwant se vyutpann he
 These people mainly follow the teachings of Mahatma Basavanna
 'virshaiv' kaa shabdic arth he - 'jo shiv kaa param bhakt ho'
 But with the passage of time, Veerashaiva's philosophy, philosophy, practice, rituals, social mobilization, Acharanyam etc
 became different from other sects
 yadhyapi virshaiv desh ke anya bhaagon - maharashtra, andhra, tamil kshetra aadi - main bhi paae jate hai kintu unki sabase adhik sankhya karnataka main pai jaati he
 Shaivites derive their religious beliefs and philosophy from the Vedas and the 28 Shaivagams
 virshaiv bhi vedon main avishvaas nahin prakat karte kintu unke darshan, karmkand tathaa samajasudhar aadi main aisi vishistataaen viksit ho gai hai jinaki vyutpatti mukhya rup se shaivagamon tathaa aise antardrushti yogiyon se hui maani jaati he jo 'vachanakaar' kehalaate hai
 In the nearly three centuries between the 12th and 16th centuries, there have been some 300 pledges, of which 30 have been women
 inamen sabase prasiddh naam basav kaa he jo kalyaan ke jain raja vijjal kaa pradhan mantri tha
 He was not only a yogi mahatma but also a karmat Sanghatanaka who established the Veerashaiva sect
 vaasav kaa lakshya aisa aadhyatmik samaaj bananaa tha jisamen jati, dharm yaa stripurush kaa bhedbhaav na rahe
 He was opposed to ritualistic fanatics and emphasized the truth of mental purity and devotion
 vah maatr ek ishwar kii upasna kaa samarthak tha or usne puja tathaa dhyaan kii paddati main saralata laane kaa praytn kiya
 a wonderful revolution arose in the society due to the end of caste discrimination and the rise of women
 gyanayog bhaktiyog tathaa karmyog - teenon vachanakaron ko maanya hai kintu bhakthi par sabase adhik jor diya jaataa he
 Many of the followers of Vasava were Harijans and they also performed inter-caste marriages
 virashaivon kaa sampradaay 'shakti vishishtadvait' kehalaata he
 The Supreme Chaitanya or Supreme Agreement is beyond the country, time and other qualities
 para sanvid kii shakti hi is vishwa kaa utpaadak kaaran he
 The world or world is not false

 What we see in humans is the development of specialization and self-consciousness, but this self-consciousness is the motivating reason for the attempt to reunite with the Supreme Consciousness
 sadhana ke parinaam swaroop jab ishwar kaa sachcha bhakt samadhi kii sarvocch sthiti ko praapt hota he tab summersaiky kii sthiti arthath ishwar ke prayek swaroop ke saath purna ekta kii sthiti utpann hoti he
 This is the state of bliss or salvation of man
 ise purna vilyan na maanakar milan ke paramanand main barabari se hissaa grahan karnaa samajhnaa adhik acha hoga
 Veerashaivas have established a tradition of spiritual discipline called 'shatasthala Shastra'
 yah maanav kii saadhaaran chetana kaa angsthal ke pratham prakram se lingsthal ke sarvocch kram par pahunch jane kii sthiti kaa suchak he
 In the whole process of spiritual practice, spiritual discipline, the emphasis is on devotion and refuge
 virshaiv mahatmaon kii kabhi kabhi 'sharan' yaa shivasharan kehete hai yane aise log jinhone shiv kii sharan main apane aapako arpit kar diya he
 His practice is called Shivayoga
 virashaivvaad mulat: advaitavaadi darshan he kintu yat: paramatma kriya or dhyaan se pare he or hamaare vaastavik anubhav kii duniya ke astitv kii vyakhya ichha tathaa kriya ke bina nahin kii ja sakati, isliye shiv ke shakti siddhant kii kalpana kii gai
 The spiritual aspirant uses one or all of his three powers to establish unity with God
 premashkti ke prayog kaa naam bhaktiyog, chintanashkti ke prayog kaa gyanayog tathaa karm shakti ke prayog kaa naam karmyog he
 It is through these that final unity with God is established
 isamen andeh nahin ki virashaivon ke bhi mandir, tirthasthan aadi vaise hi hote hai jaise anya sampradaayon ke, antar keval un devi devataaon main hota he jinaki puja kii jaati he
 As far as the relation of the Veerashaivas is concerned, the temples or other forms of cultivation are not as important as the idol of the favored linga, which is held on the body
 aadhyatmik guru prayek virshaiv ko isht ling arpit kar uske kaan main pavitra shadakshar mantra 'om nam: shivaay' phunk detaa he
 Each Veerashaiva bathes and worships with contemplation and meditation by placing the idol of the favored penis on the hand's gadali
 kehane kii aavashyaktaa nahin ki prayek virshaiv main satyaparayanata, ahimsa, bandhutavbhaav jaise ucch naitik gunon ke hone kii aashaa kii jaati he
 He is indulgent and avoids alcoholic substances etc
 basav ne is sambandh main jo nidesh jari kiye the, unka saransh yah he - chori na karo, hatya na karo or na jhooth bolo, na apni prashansa karo na dusron kii ninda, apni patni ke sivaa anyash sab striyon ko mata ke samaan samajho
 The Vedas, the Upanishads and the Shaivagam are all in Sanskrit, so the Veerashaiva pledges added to the Kannada language and literature by incorporating their essence and the eternal elements into the Kannada language and literature

 But being a mechanical device, this is the only layout possible on a typewriter

 There are two types of typing on a computer - yah vidhi computer par unicode pranali ke aane se pehle prayog kii jaati thi
 Old-fashioned Hindi fonts were used in it
 is typing kaa upyog sirf chapai aadi ke kaamon main hi hota he
 In a word processor, a non-unicoded font of Hindi is typed and typed and the print can be taken

 Although many keyboard layouts are popular for Hindi, but the main three are: - tach typing se aashay hota he bina keyboard ko dekhe keval chhukar tip karnaa
 Hindi has basically Inscript and Remington touch typing systems
 phonetic mul rup se tach typing pranali nahin he lekin yadi angreji kii kvarty tach typing kaa abhyaas ho to phonetic ko bhi bina dekhe tip kiya ja saktaa he
 Site typing refers to typing keys by looking at them
 hindi main site typing ke liye devanagari varna ankit inascript leout ke keyboard uplabdh hai
 Additionally, Inscript layout stickers are also available which can be pasted on existing keyboards
 inascript leout main varna vishesh kram main hote hai isaliye ye tach or site donon prakaar kii typing ke liye upyukt hota he
 The second method is typed in phonetic only by looking at it but it is also not the site typing in the correct form because Hindi is written by typing characters of English instead of Devanagari

 There are many differences in its song metaphor, impenetrable metaphor, locative metaphor, inferior metaphor, conventional metaphor, etc
 udhaaharan- charan camel bandaun harirai Etymology: Any form

 Form
 roopak ke saadrishy or sadharmy main manovaigyanik drushti se adhik gambhirtha or nikatataa he
 In order to fully convey our intention, to say what we say, there is' imposition of some other substance in the poet-mind
 mukh kii sundarataa kaa dhyaan karte hi pehle sundarataa ke charam nidarshan chandramaa kaa aropan kavi-chetana karti he or kis rup main karti he, yahi uski vividh vachan-bhangimaayen yaa alankaar he
 The metaphor involves the implantation, imposition, or establishment of a form in one substance by another
 abhed kaa arth 'tadatmya pratiti he, upama kaa vidhaan yaa sandhan karte samay bhi kavi-maanas main pehle yah 'tadatmya pratiti hi hogi or purnat: abhed-sthaapan mulat: upama kii nahin roopak kii pravriti he
 Therefore, it can be said that the metaphor first appears in the composition of the poet
 isiilie roopak ko 'saadrishygarbha abhedpradhan, aropamulak alankaar mana gaya he
 Beyond this, this ornamentation seems not only a poetic consciousness but also a very essential product
 bina alankaar ke bhi shreshth kavita kii rachana ho sakati he, kintu bina roopak-chetana ke shreshth kavi-karm sambhav nahin he
 In considering the Upma, Acharya Ruyak mentions three types of communion - distinction, imperviousness and impersonation - acharya mammat aadi ne bhi isi rup main roopak ke saadrishy main 'ati samya ko sweekaara he- Explaining this further, it has been said in the following instinct - roopak kii 'ati samya kii is pravriti se yahi nishkarsh nikalataa he ki kavi-chetana main koi bhi upmaan pehle roopak kii maansikta main hi udit hota he, upama kaa saadrishy to baad main kathan kii bhangima ke rup main prakat hota he
 That is why the analogy of Upma has been accepted as 'anti-discrimination'
 upmaan kii sahaayta se kiya gaya saadrishy vidhaan adhikanshat: akritimulak or kabhi-kabhi gunon ke aadhaar par bhi hota he
 But still it is not as effective as the imagery composed by the image
 roopak do asmaan tathaa swatantra ikaayiyon main antarmoot samya ko pratyakshikrut karata he
 a kind of gaudy or monotonous analogy, moving beyond comparison, the metaphor presents an identity from which a new image emerges by presenting a cohesion between two different substances or trades, containing characteristics of both substances or trades
 Occur
 donon ke bich kii yah tulana tarkatit hoti he, jisamen bauddhikta se uthaaye gayi prashr uske saundarya ko samaapt kar denge
 He creates a beautiful image to convey the intention of the poet to the reader / listener
 is prakaar roopak apane chaturdik ek prakaash-vrutt utpann karata he, jiske prakaash main kavi kaa mantavya purnat: bhashit ho uthta he
 This is his lampooning tendency
 isliye 'rupakatv kavi karm kaa muladhar kaha ja saktaa he
 It is the poet's 'metaphorical consciousness', which is illuminated in various forms of expression, by different figures of speech
 upmaan chayan ke aadhaar par upama kaa aupmy kaa prayog to koi saadhaaran kavi bhi kar saktaa he, kintu 'rupakatv kaa sundar or prabhavi prayog koi nishnaat kavi hi kar saktaa he
 The great secret of Tulsidas's popularity and greatness is the same metaphor-consciousness in his expression
 sadharmy or saadrishy se vidyaman 'ati samya mulat: roopak rup main kavi-maanas main udit hota he, kintu abhivyakti kii style se vah vibhinn alankaaron kaa rup dhaaran kar letaa he
 Hence metaphor, sangarupak, simile, catalysis, illustration, illustration, example, syllogism, contrast, indigestion, skepticism, misconception, etc
 The ornaments arise from the metaphor-consciousness of the poet
 mul baat rupakatv par hi aadhaarit hoti he, maatr shabdon kaa her-pher, kathan kii prastuti, use kisi duusare alankaar ke rup main prasthaapit kar detii he
 Reflecting on the analogies of Kalidas, Dr
 Shashibhushan Das Gupta says - tulsi ke sandarbh main kaha ja saktaa he ki, roopak, sanrupak, upama, utpreksha, drushtaant, prateep, vyatirek, aadi ke rup main unki roopak-chetana prabal or moulik rup main prakat hokar hriday ko abhibhoot karti he
 Therefore, to get acquainted with the superlative of the metaphor-consciousness of this great poet, it is necessary to be aware of the fundamental, poignant and effective use of these ornaments used in his poetry

 The process of preserving steel by dipping it in molten zinc is more than 150 years old
 is prakriya kaa avishkaar san 1837 main paris ke mosier stenislas soril ne kiya tha
 Thin wires and sheets made of plain steel are covered with a thin layer of an anti-corrosion metal to prevent corrosion
 is kaary ke liye jo dhaatuen upyog main aati hai unamem jasta or vang mukhya hai
 Zinc is the cheapest metal

 Control to a limit on the desired thickness of coating; 3
 shuddh jaste ke lep kaa chadhana; 4
 Its suitability for items such as steel spring, which may be affected by the heat of previous zinc in hot method; 5
 sapaat sataha ke lep main vikrut or tedha medhaa hone kaa abhaav, jaisaa ushn vidhi main dekha jaataa he
 The drawbacks of this method are: 1

 Difficulty in obtaining coarse spongy coatings, 3
 ushn mulamme kii tarah lep kaa chamakdaar na hona, 4
 The need to be more careful than the hot method and more difficulties in obtaining the right coating and 5
 The electrodynamic method is not as effective in welding in the manufacture of water-sensitive utensils as the hot method
 sabhi vidyudvishleshik vilyanon kaa aadhaar zincsulphate he
 In this method, the object to be coated is heated in a metal drum or box, surrounded by zinc, which contains metallic zinc

 The only flaw in this is that only zinc can be offered on small objects

 jasti chaadaron ke rasinic, chumbakeey, sookshmdarsheey tathaa bhautikee pareekshan kiye jate hai
 The adhesion test is chemical and is based on the difference in the weight of the galvanized coating, which results from the dissolution at the time of testing
 bina vastu ko nasht kiye chumbakeey pareekshan dwaara lep kii motaai nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 Due to the zinc coating being non-magnetic, the motivation changes according to the thickness of the sheet's condenser circuit

 Thickness and texture of the coating is revealed by the study of the finely cut crocodile
 bhautik vidhiyon main lep ko bina hataae chadar main saamaanya rup main modane, gothane, kinare dabaane or khinchne se jo virupata aati hai, uskaa nirdhaaran hota he
 The main drawback of repeated defects is blistering
 ye fafole atyant sookshm aakaar se lekar bade bade aakaar tak ke ho sakate hai or chadar kii sataha par nune sthaan biihat sthaan tak gherte hai
 Hydrogen collects due to the impermeability of the steel surface and blisters are formed from it
 doosraa dosha lep kaa dhoosar hona he
 In this, the area becomes of gray veins, in which the crystals are either not present at all, or are smaller than the normal expansion
 is dosha ke nishchit kaaran hai : Non-metal content in iron and jasta ooshmak se nikalne par chadar kaa bada teevr gati se thandha hona
 These defects can be prevented by taking special precautions in zinc plating

 These are the permanent winds moving from subtropical high-pressure lanes to sub-polar low-pressure lanes
 inaki pashchami disha ke kaaran inhe 'pachhuva pawan' kehete hai
 Permanent winds flowing from subtropical high air pressure tropics towards subipolar low air pressure in both the Earth's hemispheres are called westerly winds due to their westward movement
 In the northern hemisphere, it flows from southwest to northeast and in the southern hemisphere from northwest to southeast
 The best development of the westward winds is found between 40 ° to 65 ° south latitudes, because of the vast expanse of the waters here, the speed of the winds is relatively fast and the direction is fixed
 Due to their intensity in the southern hemisphere, they 'scream chalis' between 40 and 50 degrees south latitude, 'prachanda Pachasa' in the adjacent areas of 50 degrees south latitude and 'screaming satha' near 60 degrees south latitude
 It is said that due to the huge land segment of uneven high pressure in the Northern Hemisphere and the changing seasonal pattern of air pressure, the flow of this wind from the general western direction is unclear
 The range of these winds towards the pole is very unstable, which changes according to the weather and other reasons
