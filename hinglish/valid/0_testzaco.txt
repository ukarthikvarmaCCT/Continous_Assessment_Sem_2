 Unscrupulous keeps those who abstain from dieting, because if you get a grub on you, you will neither consider your relationship nor your pride and agreement
 That these people make you happy by their words, although their hearts do not agree and many of them are ill-natured and they stopped their way by getting a little price in return for the verses of God
 It is bad that these people do not respect or respect any Momin, nor do they agree with the rule of the word, and if these people persecute, then pray and pray If you give cows and zakat, then you are your dear brother and we are able to explain our verses For the people, they make a statement, and if these people break their swear after paying their obeisance and taunt you in your humble heart, then you should fight a lot against the stray people of Kufr
 Why don't you fight those people who broke their oaths and decided to take out the Rasool and they even teased you before? Had you been afraid of them, if you are truly honest, then you are more capable of being afraid of them than you, fight them, you will punish them in your hands and will make them angry and will beat you up and make you feel like a bunch of honest people

 Imdad and on the day of Jung Hunain, when your quarrel had forced you, then that kind of work did not work for you and despite the land So you got fed up on you and escaped back, then God on his Rasool and Mominin Send your smiling Nazim and Lashkars of angels whom you did not even see, and this is the punishment of the Nazir and the Kafirs on the Kuffar, after which God is willing to accept and God is a very good blessing
 Now after that year, he will not be able to go near Masjidul Haram again and if you are afraid of fire, then only God will give you If you want, then you will be able to get out of your own fury, unhappy God is a true narrator, in this book, those who do not have any faith in themselves and do not believe in the end of the day, nor the good things of God and their Rasul Neither do the true oppressed fight with those people, even those people who have been insulted, they say that Aziz is the son of God and Nusaira says b These Messiah son of Khhuda their thing and they do the same to the mouth of the same They started making things of Kafirs who have passed before them, where are they going to get lost by killing them, they left their God and made their alimony and their Zahids and Mary's son Christ as their Lord, even though they Apart from this, no more orders have been given that God should pray for the sake of God, except that what these people make of him is that he is a cook and a cook
 It is that these people want to extinguish the God of Noor with their mouth and God does not believe anything except that if they are to fulfill their Noor, if they think that the Kuffar is bad, then it is the one who has instructed their Rasool to be true and humble

 You wait with me, tell me that you spend your happiness with happiness or your helplessness will never be accepted by compulsion
 People are bad and there is no other reason for accepting their bailout but that is that they disobey God and His Messenger and if they come to the Namaz, then they spend time in the path of alacrity and God Neither do you surprise their goods nor do you want their child to do so, they want to make them happy in the world of life because of all the goods and even when they come to know about it Be Kafir and these people will swear by God, then they belong to you though Those people do not belong to you, but these people are foolish enough that if these people find a place of refuge or some place to sit in a house or house, then run away by breaking the ropes on the same side, some of them are those who accuse you in the bail
 Then if some of them are given), then they were happy and if nothing was given to them as per their wish, then they were immediately deteriorated and whatever God himself and his Soul had told them that if these people agreed on him and said that God is enough for us, God will give us his Rasul with his own blessings and deeds
 We are sure to put a flame on Allah only
 Fakirs have the right and the expenses of the detractors and those who have been trained and spent in the necks and the gaddars and in the way of God and the cost of foreigners
 Education should these have been fixed by the Hukukh Khhuda and Khhuda big Waqif is a car-bearer and there are hawks who persecute Rasul and say that it is only these ears that you say that you have ears to listen to goodness that believe in God and believe in Mominin and For those of you who have believed, have mercy and for those who persecute God, they are painful wonders, these people eat in the form of God in front of you to make you agree Do it, however, if these people are truly honest, then God and His Messenger are far more entitled that they should agree with them, do they not even know that the person who opposed God and His Messenger, it is not enough that he did the job for him There is a fire in which it will always remain, this is the biggest Russia
 The profit-makers are afraid that there will be a suzerail on these villagers who will give them whatever they are profiteering
 Say unto the heart that you Khhuda afraid you must be jesting, which He will definitely reveal it and if you ask him then you will definitely say that we were just talking about it, you say that you were laughing from God and from his rectangles and from His Messenger
 The truth is that after believing that you are infamous, even if we pass by some of you, then we will surely punish some people because of the fact that these people are definitely in profit
 Blood and profane women are each other's arm that dictates bad work and stop doing noble things and keep their hands closed, these people forget about God, then God has forgotten them too
 Profitable profanity is profanity
 God has promised the fire of souls to the profitable women and infidels that these people will always remain in that and that is enough for them and God has cursed them And for them, they are dazzling, their muscle is the people who were before you If you were more in love than you, and you have benefited from your share by increasing your child, then just as you have benefited from your share before, in the same way you have benefited from your share and in the same way that the null In the same way that you are entering, you are also those people who have lost their lives in the world and in the end, and these people are in loss, do these profits not reach the news of those people? There are those who have passed before them, the people of Noah and the people of Ad and Samud and Ibrahim, and the people of Madian and the inhabited settlements, that when they came to them by taking their Rasul Waja, and God did not persecute them, but these people They used to torture themselves and honest men and honest women are the hawk's hawk, and the namaz is read from the ban and give zakat and the verdict of God and His Rasul Dari do that people will pity Khhuda Ankhrib which Beshk Khhuda Ghalib It is true that God has promised the honest men and honest women to the gardens under which the canals continue, and they will always be in them, the best house in the gardens of Eden and the joy of God is the biggest one - it is a big success
 Do jihad with Aayee Rasool Kuffar and with the profits and tighten them and their whereabouts are the only ones and that is a bad place
 In what kind of food do you say that they did not say that they definitely said the kuffa kalam and have become infuriated after their Islam and what they could not control, they were determined to do that and they only expressed their fear because of that God himself and his Rasul have made the wealth dull, so it is good for them that these people should still live and if they do not agree then God will give them a pain in the world and in the last Maaga and not those of the whole world would be a stickler and not helpful and hawk these There are also those who had agreed with God that if they give us from their own fazl, we will surely do the blessing and the neocar will be closed, then when God has given them so much by his own fazal - then he began to blush and shrug off his face
 They had defied their hearts till the day of their meeting, because of this, against those who had promised themselves, and because Did he not even tell a lie that God knows all the secrets and his entourage and that he is very much warned about the things of the people who are willing to give freely on the Mominin and on the Mominin who are only paying their personal wages
 If you accuse Pate then you will be a prankster to them, and God will be a prankster to them and it is a painful surprise for them
 Do not ask for blessings, even if you ask for blessings for them seventy times God will not spare them at all because of the fact that they have infatuated themselves with God and His Messenger, and God has not taken the people to their destination, the people who are behind the Gods are happy to sit in their place and their goods And by his own life, he came to know about jihad in the way of God and started saying, "do not come out in the heat
 You tell me that if you understand the fire of the world, what he did Instead of that, they wanted him to laugh very little and cry a lot, so if God brings you back to some gang of these profiteers and then asks you to leave, then you can clearly say that you will not be able to come out with me and neither will you Will be able to fight with me
 When you liked to sit for the first time, then sit with those who remained behind, and out of those profiteers who died, never ever Ajeh funeral read and not be stand at his grave these people surely Khhuda and He was infuriated with his rasul and died in a state of profanity and his goods and his children do not put you in wonder, only he wants that in the world too, thanks to his goods and children, he is blessed with astonishment and starts killing them So, stay still at that time, and when a sura is nourished about jihad with God and with His Messenger, then those who are rich among them will allow you Gate and say that we should keep it be those that stayed behind that Khus and their hearts par mohar kar di gai to ye kuch nahin samajhatein magar rasul or jo log unke saath imaan laae hai un logon ne apane apane maal or apni apni jaanon se jihad kiya- yahi vah log hai jinke liye bhalaaiyaan hai or yahi log kaamyaab hone vaale hai khadaa ne unke vaaste ke vah baag taiyaar kar rakhe hai jinke neeche nahare jari hai isamen hamesha rahengen yahi to badi kamyaabi hai or kuch hila karne vaale gavaar dehati aa moujdu hue taaki unako bhi ijazat di jaae or jin logon ne khadaa or uske rasul se jhooth kaha tha vah baith rahe unamem se jin logaan ne kufgh ekhteyaar kiya ankareeb hi un par dardanaak azaab aa pahunchega na to kamazoron par kuch gunaah he na bimaaron par or na un logon par jo kuch nahin pate ki karch karen basharte ki ye log khadaa or uske rasul kii kair khwaahi karen neki karne waalon par koi sabeel nahin or khadaa bada bakshane vaala meharbaan he or na unheen logon par koi ilzaam he jo tumhaare paas aae ki tum unke liye sawari baham pahunchaa do or tumne kaha ki mere paas maujuud nahin ki tumko us par savaar karuun to vah log phir gaye or hasarat use us gam main ki un ko karch mayssar na aayaa unki aankhon se ansu jari the sabeel to sirf unheen logon par he jinhone baavjood maldaar hone ke tumse na jane kii ijazat chaahi or unke peeche rah jane vaale ke saath rahanaa pasand aayaa or khadaa ne unke dilon par mohar kar di he to ye log kuch nahin jaanate jab tum unke paas waapas aaoge to ye tumse kii mzzarat karenge tum kah do ki baaten na banaao ham hargiz tumhaari baat na maanenge hame to khadaa ne tumhaare halaat se aagaah kar diya he anaqirab khadaa or uskaa rasul tumhaari karstani ko mulahza farmaaegein phir tum zaahir va batin ke jaanane waalon kii huzuri main lautaa die jaaoge to jo kuch tum karte the bataa degaa jab tum unke paas waapas aaoge to tumhaare saamne khuda kii qasamen khaaegein taaki tum unase darguzar karo to tum unki taraf se munh pher lo beshak ye log napak hai or unka thikaana jahannum he sazaa he uski jo ye kiya karte the tumhaare saamne ye log qasamen khate hai taaki tum unase raji ho jaao to khuda badakaar logon se haragiz kabhi raji nahin hoga arab ke gavaar dehati kufr va nifaq main bade sakht hai or isi qaabil hai ki jo kitaab khuda ne apane rasul par nazil farmaai he uske ehqaam na jaane or khuda to bada dana hakim he or kuch gavaar dehati raah main kharch karte hai use tawan samajhate hai or tumhaare haq main gardishon ke muntazir hai unheen par buree gardish pade or khuda to sab kuch sunata jaanata he or kuch dehati to aise bhi hai jo khuda or akhirat par imaan rakhte hai or jo kuch kharch karte he use khuda Let's understand the means of blessings and blessings of Rasul, be aware that this is definitely the bison of his fortune, God will enter him soon in his own mercy
 The gardens under which the canals are continuing, have been prepared by Neeti, they will remain in them till Abdalabad, that is a great success and you The hawks of the Gawar countryside are profitable, and even those of the people of Madina, who are adamant on Nifaq, you do not know them, we know them; And there are some people who have confessed their crimes, those people have mixed good work and some bad work
 It is close that God will accept their fate
 Surely, you are a very splendid kind, you take zakat for their goods, due to which they Clean Pakistan and pay blessings for them because your prayers are in the interest of these people, but you know whether these people have not known that much, they surely accept the fate of the prisoners and they take care of them and that is not enough
 He is a very humble kind of person and you tell me that you should do your own work, but now God and His Messenger and Mominin We will look at the mon and soon will be returned to the person of knowledge and knowledge, then he will tell you what you used to do and there are some people who have been ordered by God to bless him or bless him and God is very aware and who throws and hurts through mafiners and mofiners and to sit in that person's ambush Is standing by Sjid who have fought before Allah and His Messenger surely Swear Khaagen That we have not intended anything other than goodness and are themselves a witness to themselves
 These people are definitely false
 You should never stand in this mosque, whose foundation has been laid on the top of every day, it is definitely more right that you Standing in it, there are those people who like to live in Pak and Pakiza and God also keeps friends of Pakistan and Pakiza, the person who has fear of God And if the foundation of your building is set on a pleasant person, it is better or the person who has laid the foundation of his building on the lobe of this bordered edge, which has cracked and if he wants then take it and burst it in the fire of the world And God does not reach the destination to the oppressed people, the foundation which they have established will always be in their hearts in their hearts, even their hearts Rkhche Fly and Khhuda bigger Wakifkar Hakeem It then Yk not that God has bought his life from Mominin and his goods on the fact that it is unfortunate for them
 These people fight in the path of God, they kill and kill themselves
 There is a definite promise and it is sure that the raita and Who is better than God in the Gospel and the Quran and who fulfills his needs, Celebrate the happiness you have made with your own purchase, this is a great success The devotees who perform the rituals, those who do the journey, those who do the gossip, the prostitutes, the prostitutes, who do the righteous work, are the ones who stop the evil deeds, and keep an eye on the limits of God, and give the blessing to those believers when the prophet and the covenant It has been revealed that Musharkeen is powerful, then it is not appropriate for him to ask for the blessings of the Maghrekit if he is a Musharkin but Ibrahim's Asking for prayers for his father was only because of this promise which he Godless Ibrahim was certainly a great man of fortune, not that God has misled him after he had instructed him to do any work, that he should tell the same things so that he should abstain from everything
 Not only that the rule of the whole sky and the land is special only for itself, it lives and kills and there is no patron or help except God himself
 However, God did a great job on the prophet and those who supported Rasool in the time of persecution, and that too after that, some of them would be awakened by them, then God did not fail them
 There is kindness on the people and pity on those Yamimas who even on the ground got fed up on them and their lives got fed up on them and they understood Oh, that there is no place for shelter except God, then God has abandoned them Taufik so that he can change the unhappy God is a very good gracious man who is afraid of the believers and live with the truths, the people of Madina and their girly countryside were not allowed to leave the Rasul God
 That he should protect the lives of his people, irrespective of the life of Rasul, this order was from the same Sabbath that he was in the soul of God who suffered from thirst or hard work or hunger
 The fast reaches or walks such a path which will be written as a noble deed of the Kuffar
 a dishonor does not destroy the souls of good-doers and these people do not spend a little or a lot of goods and do not cover any ground but immediately The name is written so that God can give them the best revenge of their actions and it is not possible that the Mominni clan stand out from them

 The ratio of the actual power and the virtual power taken by an exhaust working on AC electric power is called power multiplier or power coefficient
 shakti gunank kaa sankhyatmak maan shunya or 1 ke bich main hota he
 Power multiplier = p / s lod dwaara liye gayi shakti ke ausat maan ko 'vaastavik shakti' kehete hai 
 This power converts heat into load, performs mechanical work or transforms into some other type of energy
 jabaki abhaasi shakti keval ek ganitiya raashi he jo lod ke siron ke bich ke voltage or lod se hokar pravaahit dhara maan) ke gunanfal ke baraabar hoti he
 The power coefficient is equal to the cosine of the difference between the voltage and current
 shakti gunak = p / s That is, in order to have good power coefficient it is necessary that the difference between voltage and current is very low
 jab dhara, voltata se peeche hoti he to ise laging power factor kehete hai; jab dhara, voltata se aage hoti he to ise 'leading power-factor' kaha jaataa he
 In industries, the power coefficient is often backward due to induction motors and other inductive loads
 kisi lod dwaara 1 se bahut kam shakti gunank par vidyut shakti lenaa acha nahin mana jaataa or adhiktar bijli aapurti karne vaali companiyaan iske liye kuch dand kaa praavdhaan rakhti hai
 The low power coefficient simply means that more current is being taken for work that can be done with less current than 'utility'

 In practice, if a computer is defined, then we can call hardware as human body and software as its soul
 hardware computer ke hisson ko kehete hai, jinhen ham apni aankhon se dekh sakate hai, chhu sakate hai athwa aujaaron se unpar kaary kar sakate hai
 This is the real substance
 iske vipareet software koi padaarth nahin he
 These are the information, commands or methods on which the computer hardware works
 computer hardware software se parichit hote hai athwa software computer ke hardware se parichit evam unpar aadhaarit hote hai
 Earlier, there was only one computer system for a task and it was given programs at the mechanical level, which was economical to change
 takanic ke vikaas ke saath aise yantransh bananaa takneekee rup se sambhav or aarthik rup se laabhadaayak ho sakaa
 It was very difficult to program early computer systems because at that time the theory that software was also in the initial state of a set of information which was safe in the memory of a device

 Under the TRIPS agreement, it was said that computer programs should be protected like copyright
 isaliye object code hamaare desh main tathaa sansar ke anya deshon main isi prakaar se surakshit kiya gaya he
 Object code of a computer program is published, but not everyone's source code is published
 jin kamputer program ke sorce code prakashit kiye jate hai unamem to ve copirite se surakshit hote hai
 But computer programs whose source code is not published are protected like trade secret
 sorce code se object code compail karnaa aasaan he; yah hameshaa kiya jaataa he or isi tarah program likhaa jaataa he
 But the opposite is that it is impossible to find the source code from the object code, but it is very difficult and expensive
 is par reverse ingeneering kaa kanoon bhi lagu hota he
 That is why the source code is not published
 ise gopneey rakh kar, ise zyada aasaani se surakshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Reverse engineering is also an interesting subject, more on this sometime

 Generally we do not feel it
 yadi hamaare sharir ke kisi ang se vaayu nikaal lee jaae, tab vaayu ke dabaav kii anubhuti hamen saralata se ho jaati he
 The amount of air pressure at sea level is equal to 760 mm of mercury pressure
 jaise jaise ham vaayu main upar uthte hai, taise taise dabaav kam hota jaataa he
 Even the pressure on some mountain tops has been found to be up to 9 pounds per square inch
 vaayu ko dabaaya bhi ja saktaa he
 Pressing increases its pressure
 aisi dabi hui vaayu kaa sampidit vaayu kehete hai
 This action of pressing is called 'compressing'
 sampeden se vaayu kaa aaytan kam ho jaataa he or dabaav bad jaataa he
 Thus air pressure can be raised very high
 sampidit vaayu kaa upyog aaj bahut adhik kaamon main ho rahaa he
 It is said to be happening in over two hundred works
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki do sau se adhik kaamon main ho rahaa he
 And it is increasing day by day
 iske upyog me koi khatra nahin he
 It can be easily transported to every location by machines
 isaki kuch mashine badi saral hai or kuch jatil bhi hai
 Compressed air can be used in two ways: by compressed air in machines, such air can be placed directly in the works, or compressed air can be stored in cylinders and stored in different works as required
 is
 sampidit vaayu praapt karne kii mashiinon ko vaayu sampidak kehete hai
 The simplest device for compressing the air is the air pump to fill the air in the bicycle or motorcar tubes
 par vaayu pump se adhik dabaav vaali sampidit vaayu nahin praapt ho sakati
 For more pressure, complex and air compressors are made
 pehle pahal inkaa upyog sampidit vaayu dwaara chaalit drillon se pahaado ko katkar surang banane main hua tha
 They were also used in the rear rail brakes
 saamaanya vayusampidak se prati varg inch 60 se 100 pound kii dabaavvaali vaayu praapt hoti he
 Compressors are also made from which thousands of pounds of pressurized air can be obtained
 sampidak main silinder ke andar ek piston hota he
 There are two valves at one end of the cylinder, one opening inward and the other facing outward
 silinder ke piston ko jab khinchakar upar ke chor par laayaa jaataa he, tab silinder ke andar kii vaayu kaa dabaav kam ho jaataa he or vayumandal se vaayu is valve dwaara khinch lee jaati he
 When the piston is lowered, the opening valve closes as the pressure increases, and the outside valve opens, allowing the air of the cylinder to drain into the "wind"
 is prakriya ko kai baar dohraane se vayukaksh kii vaayu kaa dabaav dhire dhire badhane lagata he
 Air of appropriate pressure can be used by removing the tap
 vaayu sampidkon ko teen shreniyon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he : The diaphragmatic compressors are more commonly used
 inkaa siddhant vaisaa hi he jaisaa upar varnit he
 The air is pumped into the tubes of bicycles and motor vehicles by air pumps
 vaayu sampidkon se praapt sampidit vaayu dwaara chaalit drillon se pahaado main chhed kar surang banaai ja sakati he
 By air compressors, ventilation is done in theaters, cinemas, large buildings and mines, from which unclean air is removed and replaced by pure air
 isi sahaayta se pisai bhi ho sakati he
 Coal, stone, sand, concrete, etc
 are broken and crushed by large hammers from compressed air
 vaayu sampidak se praapt sampidit vaayu se revet kiya ja saktaa he or loha tathaa ispaat chhile ja sakate hai
 With the help of compressed air, polish can be carried on large ships, aircraft, motorcars, etc
 and varnish can be mounted
 gharon kii safai, deevaaron kii safedi tathaa rangaai ore fernichar par varnish chadhaai, vayusampidkon se praapt sampidit vaayu kii sahaayta se kam kharch main ho jaati he
 The cleaning of many items and the sowing of houses are also done with its help
 rail ke brake sampidit vaayu ke bal se kaary karte hai
 With the help of compressed air, many goods, such as grains, coal, etc
, can be sent from one place to another
 sampidit vaayu kii upyogita kii suchi kaaphi lambii he
 The use of compressed air is an important feature of modern science

 Earlier, the castes of the Kushwaha community - Maurya, Kachi and Koiri have been claiming themselves as belonging to the Shiva and Shakta sect

 From about 1910, both these groups formed an organization and started calling themselves Kushwaha Kshatriyas
 va murao jati ne 1928 main kshatriya varna main pahchaan hetu likhit yachika daayar kii
 This move of the All India Kushwaha Kshatriya Mahasabha reflects the trend of social upliftment by castes traditionally considered as Shudras, defined by MN Srivas as "sanskritization", which was the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
 There was a characteristic of caste politics in the turn of the century

 As a result of this superstition, he made an alternative claim to be a descendant of Lord Rama, abandoning his old claim of incarnation from Lord Shiva
 1921 me, kushavaah kranti ke samarthak ganga prasad gupta ne koiri, kaachhi, murao va kushwaha jatiyon ke kshatriya hone ke saakshyon par ek pustak prakashit kii
 He argued in the restructuring of history that Kushwaha is a descendant of Kush and provided military services to King Jayachand during the Muslim consolidation of the Delhi Sultanate in the twelfth century

 This common attempt to write the history of the Kshatriya evidence of various castes of Gupta and others was disseminated by the ethnic organizations, which Deepankar Gupta sees as establishing relations between the 'urban political elite' and the 'under-educated' villagers
 kuch jatiyon ne is kshatritv ke daawey ke samarthan main mandir nirmaan bhi karwaae, jaise ki murao logo ke ayodhya main mandir
 Some Kushwaha reformers argued on the lines of Kurmi reformer Devi Prasad Sinha Chaudhary that Rajputs, Bhumihars and Brahmins also work in the fields, so there is no connection with the Shudra varna in labor work
