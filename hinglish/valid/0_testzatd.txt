 In tropical regions, other species of bees are managed to produce honey, including the Asian honey honey

 Many bee breeding companies try to breed selections and hybridize to create desirable traits: disease and parasite resistance, good honey production, healthy behavior reduction, prolific breeding, and mild temperament

 Collecting honey from wild bee colonies is usually done by suppressing the bees with smoke and breaking the trees or rocks where the colony is located, often causing physical destruction of the nest
 yah 18 veen shatabdi tak nahin tha ki europea prakritik darshanikon ne madhumakhi coloniyon ke vaigyanik adhyayan ko shuru kiya or madhumakhi jeev vigyaan ke jatil or chhipi hui duniya ko samajhnaa shuru kiya
 The most prominent of these scientific pioneers were Samerdam, RenÃ© Antoine Farkault de Remumur, Charles Bonnet and FranÃ§ois Huber
 madhumakhi ke aantarik jeev vigyaan ko samajhane ke liye ek microscope or vichchhedan kaa upyog karne vaale pehle sabase pehle swemamram or remumoor the
 Regumur was already building a glass-walled observation hive to better observe the movements inside a ring
 unhone khuli koshikaon main andey bichaate hue dekha, lekin abhi bhi pataa nahin tha ki ek rani kaise nishechit hui thi; kisi ne kabhi bhi rani or gaban kii najdiki nahin dekhi thi or kai siddhanton ke anusaar ki raniyaan "swayan-prajnan" thim, jabaki anya logon kaa maananaa tha ki drone se aane vaali vaashp yaa "bhasma" sidhe bhautik sampark ke bina nichodit raniyon
 Huber was the first to prove by observation and experiment that quince is physically inseminated by drones outside the hives, usually a far distance
 remumur ke dizin ke baad, hubar ne behatar gilaas deevaaron vaale avlokan or anubhageeya pitti ko ek kitaab ke patton kii tarah kholaa ja saktaa banaaya
 This has allowed individual wax combs to be inspected and a direct better inspection of hive activity
 yadhyapi vah bees varsh se pehle andhaa chalaa gaya, huber ne bees saal se adhik samay ke liye saavdhaneepurvak prayog karne or sateek note banaae rakhane ke liye ek sachiv, francois barnence ko niyukt kiya
 Huber confirmed that a hive consists of a queen who is the mother of all women activists and the male drone in the colony
 vah yah bhi pushti karne vaala pehla tha ki drone ke saath sambhog ko angoothiyon ke baahar jagah le jaati he or ye raniyaan purush drone ke saath lagaataar kai matings dwaara, unke hive se bahut acchhee duuri par hawa main ucch hoti hai
 Together, he and Barnes dissected the bee under a microscope and were the first to describe the ovaries and sperm, or the queen of sperm and the sex of male drones
 hubar ko saarvbhaumik rup se "aadhunik madhumakhi vigyaan kaa pita" mana jaataa he or unke "novels obzarveshns sur les ebeills" ne madhumakhi ke jeev vigyaan or paristhitiki ke liye sabhi buniyadi vaigyanik satyon kaa pataa lagaaya he
 The entire colony was destroyed when honey was harvested to collect early forms of honey

 It was destructive and unhealthy, but it did not matter to hunter-gatherer societies because honey was generally consumed immediately and there were always more wild colonies to use

 During the medieval period and in monasteries there were centers of beekeeping, as candles were highly valued for candles and fermented honey was used to make fluffy mead in areas of Europe where vines did not grow
 18 veen or 19veen shatabdi main madhumakhi paalan main ek kranti ke lagaataar charan the, jisane fasal ko lene ke dauraan madhumakhiyon ko sangrakshit karne kii anumati di thi
 Intermediate stages in the transition from old beekeeping to new ones were recorded for example in 1768 / 1770 by Thomas Wildeman, who spoke of the disastrous old scape-based beekeeping so that bees no longer have to kill for the honey harvest
 wildman ne udhaaharan ke liye ek puaal chhatey yaa scape ke upar lakdi kii salaakhon ke ek samanaantar sarani ko tay kiya "taaki sabhi saat salaakhon ke saude" "jisamen madhumakhiyon ne apane kanghee ko thik kiya
 "he also described the use of such rings in a multi-storey configuration, which predated the modern use of supers: he described the frequent addition of brown holes below, and finally removing ones from the brood
 Is released and filled with honey, so that the flies are preserved separately at harvest for the next season
 wildman ne bhi ek or vikaas, madhumakhiyon ko apni kanghee banane ke liye "fisalane frem" vaale chhidron kaa prayog kiya, chal-kambal chhidron ke adhik aadhunik upyogon ko dikhaaya
 Wildman's book already acknowledged advances in the knowledge of bees made by Swedram, Mararidi, and de Rheumur â he included a lengthy translation of Reymur's account of the natural history of bees â and he also described other people's initiatives
 Bee while taking the crop, citing special reports from Brittany dating from the 1750s, due to the Conte de la Bordernai However, modern-day pioneers are used primarily with frames that run today, known as the coals of Greece, known as "greek beehives"
 unki upyog kii sabase puraani gavaahi 1669 tak he, haalanki yah sambhav he ki unka upyog 3,000 varsh se adhik purana he
 The 19th century saw this revolution in full beekeeping practice by American Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth through the perfection of the movable comb hive
 langstroth hubar kii pehle kii khoj kaa vyaavhaarik upyog karne vaala pehla vyakti tha, ki mom kampalon ke bich ek vishisht sthanik maap tha, jise baad main madhumakhi antariksh kaha jaataa tha, jo ki madhumakhi mom se nahin rokte hai, lekin ek mukt maarg ke rup main rahete hai
 After determining this bee space, Langstroth designed several wooden frames within a rectangular hive box, then to maintain the correct space between successive frames, and found that the bees had to construct a bee parallel to the box
 -made without bonding to each other or to the walls of the hive
 yah madhumakhi ke madhumakhiyon yaa kanghee ko nuksaan pahunchaae bina, andey, larva or pupa koshikaon ke bheetar nihit he, iskaa matlab yah bhi tha ki madhu vaale kanghee ko dhire se hataaya ja saktaa he or shahad ko kanghee ko nasht kiye bina nikaala ja saktaa he
 The empty honey comb can then be returned to the beehive to clean
 langstroth kii kitaab, da hive or hani-bi, 1853 main prakashit, madhumakhi antariksh kii apni punariksha or unke patent chal kanghee hive ke vikaas kaa varnan kiya
 The invention and development of movable-comb-honeycomb promoted large-scale commercial honey production in both Europe and America

 Classic designs developed in each country: the Dadant rings and the Langstoth rings are still influential in America; In France the de-lance trough-hive became popular and in the UK a British National Hive was delayed until the 1930s, although the smaller Smith Hive is still popular in Scotland
 kuch scandinavian deshon or rus main paaramparik gart hive 20 veen sadi main der tak jari rahe or abhi bhi kuch kshetron main rakhaa gaya he
 However, Langstroth and Dadant designs remain ubiquitous in the United States and many parts of Europe, although Sweden, Denmark, Germany, France, and Italy have their own national HEV designs

 The differences in hive amplitude are trivial compared to the common factors in all of these parts: they are all square or rectangular; They all use movable wooden frames; They all consist of a floor, brood-box, honey super, crown-board, and roof
 Traditionally pores have been constructed of cedar, pine, or cypress wood, but in recent years hives formed by injection of dense polystyrene

 In other words, the ability to recognize one's own and others' emotions, discriminate between different emotions and label them appropriately, the use of emotional information to guide thinking and behavior is called emotional intelligence

 a person can communicate more well with the person in front using their 'emotional understanding' and get better results

 The model developed by Constantin Vasili Petrides includes behavioral disposition and self-perceived competence and is measured through self-description
 aakhri namoona ek kshamta or visheshta kaa mishran he
 This model, developed by Daniel Goleman, defines the emotional Buddha as an array of skills and attributes that serve as a pathway to leadership leadership
 adhyayan ucch bhaavnaatmak buddha ke saath logon ko adhik se adhik maansik swasthya, anukaraniya kaam ke pradarshan, or adhik shaktishaalee netritv kaushal he ki pataa chalaa he
 For example, Goleman's research in his book, Working with the Emotional Buddha, suggests that the emotional multiplier is sixty-seven percent responsible for outstanding performance in leaders and counts twice as much as technical expertise or intelligence
 bhaavnaatmak buddha kii ankit karanevaale or ise viksit karne ke tareekon ko or adhik vyapak rup se pratishthit pichley kuch dashakon main ban gaye hai
 In addition, studies have begun to provide evidence to help characterize the nervous system of emotional intelligence
 
 Criticisms based on the Emotional Buddha ask whether the Emotional Buddha is the real intellect and whether its incremental validity exceeds the intellectual quotient and the five major personality traits

 dastaveji saakh kii ek khaasiyat yah hoti he ki jis lenden yaa anya qaraar ke liye yah jari hoti he usase iske kaaran milane vaale bhugtan kii jimmedaari bilkul alag or swatantra hoti he
 In this way the responsibility of the bank is defined only by the terms and conditions of credit and the agreement of sale is irrelevant here
 bikri ke qaraar se hat kar kharidaar ko milane vaali suraksha se bank ko koi matlab nahin hota or na hi uskaa uske daayitv par hi koi asar padataa he
 This principle is clearly disclosed in Article 4 UCP
 anuchhed 5 main UCP aage kahata he ki bank ko sirf dastavejon se matlab hai, maal se uskaa koi sarokaar nahin
 tadnusaar yadi labhaarthi yaa uske agent dwaara dastavejon ko niyam ke mutabik pesh kiya gaya hon to saadharantah bank bina kisi or sharton ke bhugtan karne ko baadhya he
 The policies behind the adoption of the abstraction principle are purely commercial and reflect the expectations of the parties: First, if the responsibility of the validity of the documents presented is passed on to the banks, then they are subject to the facts underlying each transaction
 The burden of investigation will have to be imposed and this will make them less inclined to issue documentary credentials, in such a situation there will be great risk and inconvenience
 Secondly, the documents required under credit may differ from sales transactions in certain circumstances; In such a situation, there will be a need to look back at the credit agreement and the bank will be confused about which rules to follow
 Third, the fact that as long as it performs documentary duties the basic function of credit is to assure the seller of payment, it suggests that banks should discharge their liability despite allegations of wrongdoing by the buyer
 "kadai se anupaalan ke siddhant" kaa bhi uddeshy yah he ki dastavejon ke aadhaar par bainkon ke bhugtan karne ke daayitv ko saral, kaarykushal or tatpar banaaya jaae
 is kaaran saakh kii bhashaa se agar pesh kiye gayi dastavej alag hon to bank ko bhugtan rokane kaa adhikaar he, bhale hi vichlan vishuddh rup se paribhaashik ho
 saamaanya kanoonee kahawat di minimis non curat lekes kaa dastaveji saakhon ke maamle main koi sthaan nahin he
 All expenses for issue of all letters of credit, agreement of documents, payment of money and other expenses such as postage expenses have to be borne by the applicant or as decided by the terms and conditions of the letter of credit
 If nothing is mentioned in this letter of credit, then the applicant has to bear all the expenses
 saakhptr ke field nan
 71B main kharchon kaa vistrut byora or unka vahan koun karegaa, is bare main jaankaree di jaayegi
 Although all documentary credit is bound to apply once it is given to the beneficiary, it is difficult to anticipate any compensation from the banker before the beneficiary submits the documents
 aise lenden main labhaarthi dwaara aavedak ko maal panhunchane kaa vachan dena bank ke vaade ke liye paryaapt nahin he kyonki bikri kaa qaraar saakh jari hone ke pehle hi ho chukaa hota he, isliye in paristhitiyon main soch-vichaar beeti baat he
 Also, the performance of the current work under an agreement cannot be a justifiable reason for a new promise by the bank: delivery of goods may be the reason for bolstering the original agreement of sale, but its use as before
 The bar cannot be used to establish a bank-beneficiary enforceable relationship
 kanoonee lekhakon ne har kanoonee pahalu ke har sambhav siddhant kaa vishleshan kiya he or bank dwaara kiye gaye vaade ke saath santoshjanak saamanjasy sthapit karne main safal nahin ho sake
 in siddhanton main anternihit pratigya, saunpe gaye kaam kaa siddhant, naveenta kaa siddhant, nirbharta kaa siddhant, adhikaran siddhant, vibandhan tathaa bharose kaa siddhant, agrim siddhant or pratibhu siddhant shaamil hai
 Davis, Treatel, Gudge, Finkelstein, and Ellinger all considered that the analysis of documentary credit must be outside the legal framework of the principles of the agreement requiring the presence of consideration
 tadnusaar, dastaveji saakh ko chaahe ek vaade, ek daayitv, kaarywahi kaa chunaav, ek niyukti yaa qaraar kaa naam diya jaae, angreji nyaayashastra main yah bataur anubandh hi sweekaarya he, baavjood is tathy ki iske apane alag lakshan hote hai jo ise apane hi tarah kaa anoothaa banaate hai
 Some countries including the US have enacted laws governing the letter of credit
 UCP tathaa ISP98 sahit abhyaas ke niyamon ke saath kaam karne ke liye ye kanoon banaae gaye hai
 These rules of practice are incorporated into the transaction of letters of credit with the consent of the parties
 UCP kaa naveenatam sanskaran UCP600 he jo 1 july 2007 se prabhavi he
 The last amendment was the UCP500 which came into effect on 1 January 1994
 chunki UCP kanoon nahin hote, isliye pakshon ko apni vyavastha main inhen saamaanya samjhauton ke praavdhaan ke taur par shaamil karnaa padataa he
 In this, the customer pays the money first and waits for the seller to send the goods
 yah ICC ke UCP600 ke adheen he, jisamen bank maal bhejne vaale ko kuch dastavej pesh karne or diye gayi niyamon or sharton kaa kadai se paalan karne par bheje gayi maal kii keemat chukaane kii jimmedaari letaa he
 Here the customer can be sure that the goods he is expecting will get the same goods as these documents will be proof that the specific terms and conditions have been met, while the supplier of the goods can be sure that If it meets the conditions, then the price of the consignment is guaranteed by the bank, which is completely independent of the parties to this contract of transaction
 darshan or muddat ICC ke URC 525 ke adheen he, bhugtan yaa draft sweekaar ho jane ke baad bheje gaye maal ke dastavej graahak ko de diye jate hai, jisamen bhugtan / sweekruti ke sankalan ke evaj main dastavej dene ke liye, pehle maal bheja jaataa he, uske baad usase swatvadhikaar se sambandhit tamaam dastavej vikreta ke bank ke dwaara graahak ke bank ke paas bhej diye jate hai

 The second stage of the iron ore steel making process is steelmaking
 kachche lohe se ispaat banane ke liye kachche lohe main upasthit atirikt carbon tathaa gandhak, phosphorus aadi ashuddhiyon ko nikaala jaataa he or maiganej, nickel, chromium tathaa vanadium aadi tatv milaaye jate hai taaki vaanchit prakaar kaa ispaat banaaya ja sake
 The history of steel production is about four thousand years old
 antolia ke utkhanan se kuch ispaat ke saamaan mili hai
 Talking about the continent of Asia, there has been evidence of high-volume steel in Sri Lanka in three hundred years BC
 srilanka ne ispaat nirmaan ke liye hi vaayu-bhatti kaa nirmaan kiya tha
 The iron pillar of Delhi is a living testimony to the antiquity and excellence of Indian steel making
 cimentikaran vidhi dwaara pehali baar italy main balistor ispaat kaa nirmaan kiya gaya
 In modern times, the commercial manufacture of steel began after the discovery of the Basmer method
 basamer vidhi se ispaat kaa utpaadan kaaphi sasta ho gaya
 Later, with the introduction of the Gilchrist â Thomas method, the Basmer method was further improved
 baad main semen-martin vidhi kii khoj se ispaat nirmaan or bhi sugam ho gaya
 Iron is not found in an independent state in the womb of the earth, rather it is found in a compound state with oxygen and sulfur
 mul rup se louhe ke do ayask hote hai- hematite or pirit 
 Iron is extracted from hematite, separating oxygen
 louh ayask se lohe ko alag karnaa louh nishkarshan kehalaata he
 Iron is melted in the presence of carbon in iron extraction
 is kriya ko pragalan kehete hai
 Initially, low melting point metals were smelted
 tambe kaa galnaank 1000 degree celcysius he, jabaki tin 250 degree celsius par pigal jaataa he
 The melting point of cast iron is 1370 Â° C
 800 degree celsius ke baad oxikaran dar teji se bad jaataa he
 This is why smelting is carried out in low-oxygen environments
 tambe or tin ke vipareet, carbon tarah lohe main aasaani se ghul jaataa he
 In this way steel is made by mixing carbon in iron
 ayask se adhik se adhik dhaatu praapt karne ke liye avkaarak vastu, carbon, bahutayat se milaai jaati he
 The carbon is subsequently removed to the desired volume by oxidation
 isse saath ke duusare tatwon kaa bhi, jinka avkaran hua rahata he or jo oxikaraniya hote hai, oxikaran ho jaataa he
 It is to be noted here that a little manipulation of carbon in iron causes a big change in the quality of the steel
 ispaat ke gunon main vaanchit badlaav ke liye louhe or carbon ke mishran main duusare padaarth bhi milaae jate hai
 Nickel and manganese are added to the steel to increase its tensile strength
 kathorta badhaane ke liye chromium or venedium kaa mishran kiya jaataa he
 In metallurgical practice, the term "pure metal" is also used for a metal of trade mixtures which primarily have the same properties as a pure chemical metal
 inamen shesh jo ashuddhta hoti he yaa to use dur karnaa kathin hota he, athwa dhaatu main koi vishesh gun praapt karne ke liye use jaan boojhkar milaayaa jaataa he
 The elements thus mixed are called 'alloying elements'
 pracheen kaal main ispaat utpaadan kii do vidhiyaan prachlit thim
 The famous 'wuts' steel of India was made by these methods
 carbadhishoshan vidhi main pitwaan lohe ko coke ke sampark main rakhkar paryaapt samay tak ucch taap par garam kiya jaataa he
 The characters in which this action is done are called transformation characters and they are made of stone stools
 in paatro ko carbadhishoshan bhatthiyon kiya jaataa he
 In order to prevent the entry of air into the vessel, they are well sealed with fire materials, otherwise the effect of air will cause coal to burn to ashes and iron will be oxidized
 paatr ko lagabhaag 48 ghante main 1,000Â° sein
 tak garam kiya jaataa he
 Keep this temperature stable for seven to nine days
 is kriya ke parinaam swaroop koyale kaa carbon lohe main pravisht ho jaataa he
 When the carbon reaches sufficient depth the characters are cooled slowly for a period of one week
 is prakaar jo chaden nikalati hai unki sataha par fafole dikhaai dete hai
 Therefore they are called 'blister steel'
 is ispaat ko garam karke pitayee kii jaati he jisase yah samras ho jaae
 Even after beating steel, it has minimal unevenness
 is ispaat ko ghadiya main dravit karke usak rasinic sanghatan ek sa kar liya jaataa he
 Carbidification is also liberated from the sintered particles present in steel by this action
 is kaary ke liye adhiktar 50 pound dharitavali graphite kii ghadiyaan prayukt kii jaati hai
 These clocks are heated in coke kilns by placing carbodispersion steel
 ghadiya vidhi main dhaatu kaa parishkar nahin hota, isliye iske liye upyukt prabhaar yathasambhav shuddh hona chahie
 Earlier, high quality tool steel was made by this method
 ispaat-nirmaan main asli kranti 1850 ke dashak ke antim dinon main aayi
 The basemar method was the first successful method by which large quantities of steel could be produced
 iske baad khulaa chulhaa vidhi aayi
 Modern steelmaking can be divided into two parts - primary and secondary steelmaking
 praathmik ispaat nirmaan use kehete hai jisamen ispaat-nirmaan ke liye adhikanshtah vatya bhatthi se nikle naye lohe kaa upyog kiya jaay
 Secondary steel fabrication is that in which brittle or scrap steel is used for steel making
 ispatnirmaan ke samay nikaleen gaison kaa upyog urja ke strot ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 In 1856, Henry Bessemer revolutionized the methods of steel production
 is vidhi main nashpati main jise 'besimar parivertiddh' kehete he, dravit kachche lohe main dhaunkani se vaayu pravaahit kii jaati he
 Oxidation of impurities present in liquefied iron is by oxygen of air
 ye kriyaayein ooshmaakshepak hoti hai, isliye is vidhi main bahya idhan kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati
 The impurities present in iron are oxidized to form sintered and the remaining iron takes the form of steel
 besimar parivartitra kaa vahya bhaag ispaat patt se bana hota he tath andar kii ore ooshmasah padaarthon ke astr die jate hai
 There are two methods under the Bessemer method: acidic and coaxial
 in paddatiyon kaa upyog kachche lohe ke gunon par nirbhar karata he
 If cast iron has a high amount of phosphorus, coaxial method is used
 jahaan phosphorus ke niraakaran kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti vahaan amleey paddati vyavahrut kii jaati he
 The lining of thermodynamic materials inside the Bessemer converter depends on the method used
 amleey paddati main adhiktar silikamay padaarth upyog main aate hai jabaki samaakshareey paddati main samaakshareey padaarth, jaise dolomite, hi upyog main laae jate hai
 The air of the Bessemer converter consists of air springs, through which the air blows on the high flame in the liquefied iron
 ucch daab isliye aavashyak he ki dhaman kaal main drav loha tonti ke dwaara parivartittra ke vayudhan main na chalaa jaae
 The main impurities in the acidic system are silicon, manganese, and carbon
 inke oxikaran main lagbhag 12 minute lagate hai
 First silicones and manganese are oxidized and they form clinker
 phir carbon oxikrut hokar carbon monoksaide gas banaata he, jo parivartitra ke munh par prajvalit hokar vishaal jwaala utpann karata he
 After this action, the finished steel is named after the changer vessel is pulled out in the tail
 phir aavashyaktaanusaar isamen pun: carburikaarak tathaa vioxikaran daalkar ispaat ko aichhik rasinic sanghatan kaa banaaya jaataa he
 All actions in the axillary system are similar to the acidic method, but it takes an additional time of 5-6 minutes to oxidize phosphorus
 silicon, manganeez, tathaa carbon ke kramik oxikaran ke pashchaat hi phosphorus oxikrut hota he or paatr main vidyaman chooney ke saath milakar samaakshareey dhaatumal banaata he
 Only after separating this slag, carburetic and deoxidizer are added to the metal again
 ise 'basic oxygen vidhi' bhi kehete hai
 In 1851, the Linz and Donavitz metallologists of Austria discovered a converged form of the Bessemer method, named after them L
W
 D
 method is called
 isamen parivartitra paatr main dravit lohe kii sataha par shuddh oxigen pravaahit kiya jaataa he
 By this method, the oxidation of impurities is quickly achieved and nitrogen-free steel is obtained
 aaj vishwa kaa lagbhag 75 pratishat ispaat utpaadan khuli chulli bhatthi vidhi se kiya jaataa he
 An open furnace is used for this work
 besimar vidhi kii tarah hi isamen bhi amleey tathaa samaakshareey roopantaran hote hai
 The use of these methods depends on the chemical composition of the raw material

 In 1957, Charles Hard Towns and Arthur Leonardo Schavalo at the Bell Laboratory began a serious study on infrared laser
 As the idea developed, the focus shifted from infrared frequencies to more visible light instead
 This concept was originally a " Was referred to as "optical moser
" One year later, Bell Laboratory proposed a monopoly application for the proposed optical moser
 Did i Schawlow and Townes sent a manuscript physical review of theoretical calculations, which was published the same year his paper
 
 In those days Gordon Gould, a graduate student at Columbia University, was working on a doctoral research paper on the energy levels of excited thallium
 Gould and Towns met on the general topic of radiation emissions
 In November 1957, Gould called the "laser" Wrote your thoughts related to the suggestion of using an open resonator which is an important component for future lasers

 He continued to work on his idea and filed a patent application in April 1959
 The US Patent Office rejected his application and This patent was given to the Bell Laboratory in 1960
 It sparked a legal battle that lasted for 28 years and earned scientific reputation and more money
 But i Goold won his first short patent in 1977, but could not claim his first patent victory until 1987, when a federal judge issued him a patent for optically pumped lasers and gas-fired lasers
