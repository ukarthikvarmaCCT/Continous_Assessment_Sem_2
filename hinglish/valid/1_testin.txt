 North China and Southern China were located on independent continents
 chota mahadweep kazakhstania madhya carbonipheras yug main siberia se takaraa gaya tha
 Western Kazakhstania collided with the Baltic at the end of the Carboniferous Era, causing them to cease contact with the Ural Ocean and causing them to originate in the western proto-tethys Ural mountains and the vast continent Lauresia
 This was the last stage of Pangea's origin
 is bich dakshini america dakshini laurenshia se takaraa gaya tha jisase rek mahaasaagar kaa rasta band ho gaya tha or epalachiyans evam auchita parvaton ke sabase dakshini hisse kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 By this time Gondwana was located near the South Pole and glaciers were formed in Antarctica, India, Australia, South Africa, and South America
 uttari china kaa hissaa carbonipheras yug ke ant tak siberia se takaraa gaya tha or is tarah proto-tethis mahaasaagar puri tarah se band ho gaya tha
 At the beginning of the Permian era, the Cimmerian Plate split off from Gondwana and began to move towards Lauresia, creating a new ocean, the Tethys Ocean at its southern tip, and closing the path to the plato-tethys Ocean
 zyaadaatar bhu-bhaag abhi bhi ekikrut hi tha
 In the Triassic period, Pangea moved slightly in the southwest direction

 peleo-tethis pashchim se purv tak band ho gaya tha or is tarah cimerian orogeni kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 Pangea looked like the letter "C" in English, which contained an ocean, the new Tethys Ocean, inside the Sea
 jurassic kaal ke madhya tak panzia main daraar pad gayi thi, iske vikhandan kaa vivaran neeche diya gaya he
 Fossil-evidence of Pangea includes the presence of similar and integral species found on continents that have now gone far
 udhaaharan ke liye, therapcid listrosoras ke jeevashm dakshin africa, bharat or australia main glosopteris flora ke sadasyon ke saath-saath paae jate hai jinka vistaar dhruviya vrutt se lekar bumadhya rekha tak hua hoga, agar mahadweep apni vartmaan sthitiyon main rahe honge; isi tarah mithe pani ke sarisrup mizosoras keval brazil or pashchimi africa ke taton ke sthaneey kshetron main paae jate hai
 Additional evidence of Pangea is found in the geology of the adjacent continents, including the matching of geological trends between the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa
 carbonipheras kaal ke dhruviya barf kii parat ne panzia ke dakshini chor ko dhank liya tha
 Especially glacial collections and structures dating back to the same era are found on many different continents that may have been together in the Pangea continent
 dhruviya vichlan ke spasht margon kaa peleomagnetic adhyayan vishaal-mahadweep ke siddhant kaa bhi samarthan karata he
 Geologists can determine the movement of continental plates by examining the orientation of magnetic minerals in rocks; When rocks are formed, they absorb the magnetic properties of the Earth and indicate in which direction the poles are present relative to the rock

 The continuity of mountain ranges also provide evidence for Pangea
 iskaa ek udhaaharan epalchian parvat shrinkhalaa he jo purvottar sanyukt rajya america se lekar ireland, britain, greenland or scandinavia ke calladonids tak faili hui he
 Pangea had three major phases of fragmentation
 pehla charan praarambhik-madhya jurassic kaal main shuru hua tha jab panzia purv main tethis mahaasaagar se or pashchim main prashanth mahaasaagar se alag hona shuru hua, jisase antat vishaal mahadwipon loresia or gondvanaa kaa vikaas hua
 The rift that began to form between North America and Africa gave rise to many failed cracks
 a rift resulted in the creation of a new ocean, the North Atlantic Ocean
 atlantic mahaasaagar ek samaan rup se nahin khulaa tha; uttar-madhya atlantic main daraar bananaa shuru hua tha
 The South Atlantic did not open until the Cretaceous
 loresia ne dakshinavart main ghoomana shuru kar diya tha, yah uttar main uttar america evam dakshin main uresia kii ore bad gaya
 The path of the Tethys Ocean was also closed due to the rise of Lauresia in a clockwise direction
 isi bich africa ke duusari taraf purvi africa, antarctic or madagascar ke nikatavarti hashiyon ke saath ek nayaa daraar bhi bananaa shuru ho gaya tha jisase dakshin-pashchimi hind mahaasaagar kii utpatti hui, yah bhi criteshas main khul rahaa tha
 The second important phase of the fragmentation of Pangea began in the early Cretaceous period, when the small giant continent Gondwana split into several continents
 lagbhag 200 eme main simriya mahadweep upar varnit ke anusaar uresia se takaraa gaya 
 haalanki simriya ke takaraane ke saath hi ek sabadakshan kshetra nirmit ho gaya tha
 This subduction zone was called the Tethyan Trench
 yah samudri khai sambhawatah tethian mid-oshan rij ke rup main upashakhit ho gaya tha, yah rij tethis mahaasaagar ke vistaar ke liye jimmedaar tha
 This probably caused the northward movement of Africa, India and Australia
 praarambhik kriteshs kaal main atlantic jo aaj kaa dakshin america or africa he, antat purvi gondvanaa se alag ho gaya tha jisase "dakshin bhartiya mahaasaagar" kaa rasta khul gaya tha
 In the Middle Cretaceous period, Gondwana disintegrated and opened the way to the South Atlantic Ocean as South America began to move away from Africa to the west
 dakshin atlantic ek samaan rup se viksit nahin hua tha; balki yah uttar se dakshin kii ore daraar ke rup main bana tha
 Also Madagascar and India began to break away from the Antarctic at the same time and move northward, opening the way to the Indian Ocean
 madagascar or bharat criteshas kaal ke ant main 100-90 eme main ek duusare se alag ho gaye the
 India continued northward towards Eurasia at a speed of 15 cm per year and closed the Tethys Ocean, while Madagascar stayed there and settled in the African Plate
 newjiland, new calladonia or jeelandia kaa shesh bhaag australia se alag hone laga tha or prashanth kii disha main purv kii ore bad rahaa tha or isane coral sagar or tasman sagar kaa rasta khol diya tha
 The third important and final phase of the fragmentation of Pangea was completed in the early Sinozoic era
 loresia us samay alag hua jab uttar america / greenland uresia se mukt ho gaya or lagbhag 60-55 eme main isane norway ke sagar kaa maarg khol diya
 atlantic or hind mahaasaagar kaa vistaar hona jari rahaa or tethis mahaasaagar kaa maarg band ho gaya
 Meanwhile Australia split from the Antarctic and moved rapidly northward, just as India did more than 40 million years ago and is currently in a collision situation with East Asia
 australia or bharat donon is samay prati varsh 5-6 centimetre kii gati se purvottar disha main bad rahe hai
 The Antarctic has been in or near the South Pole since the origin of Pangea in about 280 MA
 bharat takreeban 35 eme kii shuruyaat main asia se takaraane laga tha jisase himalay kii orogeni kaa nirmaan hua or tethis kaa samudri maarg bhi antat band ho gaya; yah takkar aaj bhi jari he
 The African plate began to change its directions from west to northwest toward Europe and South America began to move northward, separating it from Antarctica and for the first time the entire ocean circulation around the Antarctic
 , Due to which the continent began to cool down rapidly and glaciers were formed
 Other significant events during the Sinozoic era included the opening of the Gulf of California, the rise of the Alps, and the formation of the Japanese sea

 Each angle of the square is a right angle, that is, at 90 degrees
 In non-euclidean geometry, squares are more generally polygons with 4 equal sides and equal angles
 In spherical geometry, a square is a polygon whose edges are great circle arcs of equal distance, which meet at equal angles
 Unlike the square of plane geometry, the angles of such a square are larger than a right angle
 In hyperbolic geometry, squares with right angles do not exist
 Rather, squares in hyperbolic geometry have angles of less than right angles
 Larger squares have smaller angles

 This is your gurudakshina

 He gave the final teachings - Manuscripts condemn God and Rishis, not Rishikrit texts
 veda pramaan hai
 Do not leave this criterion by hand

 i believe that there is nothing wrong in the Gita
 iske alaava gita vedon ke khilaaf nahin he
 There is no other scriptural evidence except the Vedas - to propagate this truth, Swamiji started visiting the whole country and wherever he went, the pandits and scholars of the ancient tradition gave up on him
 sanskrit bhashaa kaa unhen agaadh gyaan tha
 He was fluent in Sanskrit
 saath hi ve prachand taarkik the
 He studied the Christian and Muslim scriptures thoroughly
 atev akele hi unhone teen-teen morchon par sangharsh aarambh kar diya
 The two fronts were of Christianity and Islam, but the third front was of Sanatanadharmi Hindus, in which Swamiji had to face many insults, stigmas and sufferings
 dayanand ne buddhivaad kii jo mashaal jalaayee thi, uskaa koi jawaab nahin tha
 Neither Muslims nor Christians, nor Hindu scholars and scholars who follow the Puranas could answer what they were saying
 hindu navotthana ab puure prakaash main aa gaya tha or anek samajhadaar log man hi man anubhav karne lage the ki vastav main puranic dharm kii pongapathi main koi saar nahin he
 Swamiji strongly contradicted the evils prevalent in the prevailing religions, whether it was Sanatan Dharma or Islam or Christianity
 apane mahagranth satyarth prakaash main swamiji ne sabhi maton main vyaapt buraaiyon kaa khandan kiya he
 Unlike his contemporary reformers, Swamiji's opinion was not limited to the educated class but the Arya Samaj also attracted the ordinary masses of Aryavarta
 san 1872 i
 main swami ji kalakatta padhaare
 There Devendranath Thakur and Keshav Chandra Sen gave him a big welcome
 brahmo samaajiyon se unka vichaar-vimarsh bhi hua kintu isiyat se prabhavit brahmo samaji vidwaan punarjanm or veda kii pramanikta ke vishay main swami se ekamat nahin ho sake
 It is said that in Calcutta itself, Keshav Chandra Sen advised Swamiji that if you leave Sanskrit and start speaking in Aryabhasa, then there can be immense favor of the country
 tabhi se swami ji ke vyakhyanon kii bhashaa aryabhasha ho gayi or aryabhashi praanton main unhe aganit anuyaayi milane lage
 Swamiji came to Mumbai from Calcutta and on 10 April 1875, he founded the 'arya Samaj'
 mumbai main unke saath prarthana samaaj waalon ne bhi vichaar-vimarsh kiya
 But this society was a Mumbai version of Brahmo society
 atev swami ji se is samaaj ke log bhi ekamat nahin ho sake
 Swamiji came to Indraprastha after returning from Mumbai
 vahaan unhone satyanusndhan ke liye isai, musalmaan or hindu panditon kii ek sabha bulaayi
 But even after two days of deliberations, people could not reach any conclusion
 indraprastha se swami ji punjab gaye
 a lot of enthusiasm arose in Punjab and Aryasamaj branches started opening up all over the province

 Maharishi Dayanand was trying to establish unity by bringing all the religious leaders on one platform

 His fundamental ideas in his immortal treatise Satyarth Prakash, Sanskar Vidhi and Rigvedadi Bhasya are clearly attainable

 He was in favor of participation of all varnas and women in social restructuring
 rashtriya jaagran kii disha main unhone saamaajik kranti tathaa aadhyatmik punarutthan ke maarg ko apanaaya
 The foresight, patriotism and pragmatism displayed in his education concepts are completely relevant and contemporary

 Due to the state of foreigners being in the Aryavarta, there are differences, differences, no consumption of celibacy, reading and studying the law and self-immolation in childhood, sensuality, false language, kulakshan, propagation of Vedas, etc
 are misdeeds
 The brothers fight and then the third foreigner comes and becomes a punch
 unhone rajdhyaksh tathaa shashan kii vibhinn parishadon evam samitiyon ke liye aavashyak yogyataon ko bhi ginaya he
 He favored the system of justice based on sage pranit texts
 swami dayanand saraswati ko saamanyat: keval arya samaaj ke sansthaapak tathaa samaaj-sudhaarak ke rup main hi janaa jaataa he
 Very few people are aware of his remarkable role in the efforts made for national independence
 vastusthiti yah he ki paradheen aryaavart main yah kehane kaa saahas sambhavat: sarvapratham swami dayanand saraswati ne hi kiya tha ki "aryaavart, aryavartiyon kaa he"
 The entire plan of our First Independence Summer, 1857 revolution was also prepared under Swamiji's leadership and he was also its principal architect
 ve apane pravachanon main shrotaaon ko praaia: rashtrawaad kaa upadesh dete or desh ke liye mar mitane kii bhaavana bharte the
 In 1855, when the Kumbh Mela was held in Haridwar, Swamiji traveled from Abu Mountains to Haridwar to join it
 raste main unhone sthaan-sthaan par pravachan kiye tathaa deshavaasiyon kii nabj tatoli
 He realized that people are now fed up with the tyrannical rule of the British and are eager to fight for the independence of the country
 swami dayanand saraswati ne haridwar pahunch kar vahaan ek pahari ke ekaant sthaan par apana deraa jamaaya
 While there, he met five such people who later became the masters of the revolution of 1857
 ye paanch vyakti the naanaa sahib, ajimullah khan, bala sahab, tathya tope tathaa babu kunwar singh
 The negotiations went on for a long time and it was here that it was decided to prepare the ground for armed revolution against the Firangi government and then on a certain day, the trumpet of revolution would be played together in the whole country
 jansadharan tathaa aryavartiya sainikon main is kranti kii aawaaj ko pahunchane ke liye 'roti tathaa camel' kii bhi yojana yaheen taiyaar kii gai
 The main role in this entire discussion was that of Swami Dayanand Saraswati
 vichaar vimarsh tathaa yojana-nirdhaaran ke uparant swami ji to haridwar main hi ruk gaye tathaa anya paanchon rashtriya netaa yojana ko yatharth rup dene ke liye apane-apane sthanon par chale gaye
 After his departure, Swamiji established contact with some of his trusted ascetics and formed a secret organization
 is sanghathan kaa mukhyalay indraprastha main mahrauli sthit yogamaya mandir main banaaya gaya
 This headquarters played a notable role in the freedom struggle
 swami ji ke netritv main saadhuon ne bhi sampoorn desh main kranti kaa alakh jagaaya
 He used to carry the messages of revolutionaries from one place to another, encouraging them and if necessary, he himself would take up arms and fight with the British
 san 1857 kii kranti kii sampoorn avadhi main rashtriya netaa, swami dayanand saraswati ke nirantar sampark main rahe
 Even Swami was not disappointed at the failure of freedom struggle
 unhen to is baat kaa pehle se hi abhas tha ki keval ek baar praytn karne se hi swatantrata praapt nahin ho sakati
 For this, a long process of struggle will have to be carried out
 haridwar main hi 1855 kii baithak main babu kunwar singh ne jab apane is sangharsh main safalataa kii sambhaavna ke bare main swami ji se poocha to unka bebaak uttar tha "swatantrata sangharsh kabhi asafal nahin hota
 India has gradually become a revolution in a hundred years
 ab isko swatantra hone main bhi ek sau varsh lag jaaenge
 Many precious lives will be sacrificed in the attainment of this freedom
 " swami ji kii yah bhavishyavaanee kitni sahi nikali, ise baad kii ghatnaon ne pramanit kar diya
 After the failure of freedom struggle, when Tatya Tope, Nana Saheb and other national leaders met Swamiji, he also advised them not to get discouraged and wait for the right time
 1857 kii kranti ke do varsh baad swami ji ne swami virajanand ko apana guru banaaya or unase diksha lee
 Staying in Swami Virjanand's ashram, he studied the Vedas, meditated on them and after that, according to the instructions of his Guru, he started propagating Vedic knowledge
 isi uddeshy kii prapti ke liye unhone arya samaaj kii bhi sthapana kii or uske madhyam se samaaj-sudhaar ke anek kaary kiye
 He campaigned strongly against untouchability, sati, child marriage, male sacrifice, religious parochialism and superstitions and he supported widow marriage, religious generosity and mutual brotherhood
 in sabake saath swami ji logon main deshbhakti kii bhaavana bharne se bhi kabhi nahin chookte the
 In the beginning, many people put various obstacles in Swami ji's social reform work and opposed them
 dhire-dhire unke tark logon kii samaj main aane lage or virodh kam hua
 His popularity continued to grow
 isse angrej adhikariyon ke man main yah ichha uthi ki agar inhen angreji sarkaar ke paksh main kar liya jaae to sahaj hi unke madhyam se jansadharan main angrejon ko lokapriy banaaya ja saktaa he
 Earlier, the British officers had likewise joined some other sermons and religious officials by giving different kinds of temptation
 unhone swami dayanand saraswati ko bhi unheen ke samaan samajha
 Accordingly, Swamiji was met through the then Governor General Lord Northbrook through a Christian priest
 yah mulaakaat march 1873 main kalakatta main hui
 After some formal talk here and there, Lord Northbrook humbly put his point before Swamiji - "in the beginning of your lecture, you will be able to pray for the welfare of the English government in the God you pray
 " Swami ji readily understood everything by listening to the Governor General
 unhen angreji sarkaar kii buddhi par taras bhi aayaa, jo unhen thik tarah nahin samaj saki
 He boldly and firmly replied to the Governor General- governor general ko swami ji se is prakaar ke tikhe uttar kii aashaa nahin thi
 The meeting was terminated immediately and Swamiji returned from there
 iske uparant sarkaar ke guptchar vibhaag kii swami ji par tathaa unki sanstha arya-samaaj par gahari drushti rahi
 Records of each of his movements and every word he spoke began to be kept
 aam janata par unke prabhaav se sarkaar ko ahsaas hone laga ki yah baagi fakir or aryasamaj kisi bhi din sarkaar ke liye khatra ban sakate hai
 Therefore, various types of conspiracies were started to eliminate Swamiji
 swami ji kii mrityu jin paristhitiyon main hui, usase bhi yahi abhas miltaa he ki usamen nishchit hi agreji sarkaar kaa koi shadyantr tha
 Swami ji died on October 30, 1883, at dusk on the day of Deepawali
 un dinon ve jodhpur naresh maharaj jaswant singh ke nimantran par jodhpur gayi hue the
 His frequent discourses were there
 yadakada maharaj jaswant singh bhi unke charnon main baithkar vahaan unke pravachan sunate
 Two or four times Swamiji also went to the state palaces
 vahaan par unhone nanheen naamak veshya kaa anaavashyak hastkshep or maharaj jaswant singh par uskaa atyadhik prabhaav dekha
 Swamiji felt it very bad
 unhone maharaj ko is bare main samajhaayaa to unhone vinamrata se unki baat sweekaar kar lee or nanheen se sambandh tod liye
 This led to a lot of opposition against the little Swamiji
 usne swami ji ke rasoie kaliya urf jagannatha ko apni taraf mila kar unke doodh main pisa hua kaanch dalava diya
 Shortly afterwards Swami came to confess his crime and apologized for it
 udaar-hriday swami ji ne use raah-kharch or jivan-yaapan ke liye paanch sau rupye dekar vahaan se vidaa kar diya taaki police use pareshaan na kare
 Later, when Swamiji was admitted to the hospital in Jodhpur, the concerned doctor also remained under suspicion
 us par aarope tha ki vah aushadhi ke naam par swami ji ko halkaa vish pilaataa rahaa
 Later, when Swamiji's health started deteriorating, he was brought to the hospital in Ajmer
 magar tab tak kaaphi vilamb ho chukaa tha
 Swamiji could not be saved
 is sampoorn ghatnakram main ashanka yahi he ki veshya ko ubhaarne tathaa chikitsak ko bargalane kaa kaary angreji sarkaar ke ishaare par kisi angrej adhikari ne hi kiya
 Otherwise it was not possible for an ordinary prostitute to do such a conspiracy against a well-known and popular person like Swami Dayanand Saraswati only on his own
 bina kisi protsaahan or sangrakshan ke chikitsak bhi aisa dussahas nahin kar saktaa tha
 The body of Swami Dayanand ji, the pioneer of Swadharma, Swabhasa, Swarashtra, self-culture and indigenous promotion, merged into Panchatatva on the day of Diwali in 1883 and he left behind a principle, Krishnamanto Vishwamaryam - that is, make the whole world the best human
 unke antim shabd the - "prabhu! tuune acchhee lila kii
 May your wish be fulfilled

 Red wine is made from red or black grape musts that are sent for fermentation with grape peels
 white wine ko ferminting zeus se taiyaar kiya jaataa he jiske liye pise hue angooron ko dabaakar unka ras nikaal liya jaataa he; chhilkon ko hataa diya jaataa he or unka anya koi istemaal nahin hota he
 Sometimes white wine is made from red grapes, for this the juice is extracted with the least amount of grape peels
 rose wine ko laal angooron se taiyaar kiya jaataa he jahaan ras ko gahare rang ke chhilkon ke sampark main keval utani der ke liye rakhaa jaataa he taaki vah uske gulabi rang ko to grahan kar sake lekin chhilkon main paae jane vaale tannin se bachaa rahe
 To begin the process of primary fermentation, the yeast is mixed with mustard for red wine or juice for white wine

angoor kii gunvattta or lakshith wine kii style ke aadhaar par wine nirmaataa ke kisi vishesh lakshya ko puraa karne ke liye inamen se kuch charnon ko joda yaa hataaya ja saktaa he
 Many wines of comparable quality are produced with a similar but notably different perspective from their production; Quality is determined on the basis of the characteristics of the starting material and not necessarily on the steps taken during vinification
 uparokt prakriya main vividhtaayen dekhi jaati hai
 In the case of bubbly wines such as champagne, an additional fermentation occurs inside the bottle in which carbon dioxide is trapped and special types of bubbles are created
 sweet wine yah sunishchit karte hue taiyaar kii jaati he ki fermentation kii prakriya puri ho jane ke baad kuch avshisht sharkara ke avshesh bache rah gaye hai
 This can be done by delaying the time of harvesting, cooling the grapes to concentrate the sugars, or adding something to eliminate the remaining yeast before the fermentation process is complete; For example, high proof brandy is added to it when preparing port wine
 anya maamalon main wine nirmaataa mithe angoor ke ras kaa kuch hissaa bachaakar rakhane kaa vikalp chun sakate hai or fermentation kii prakriya puri ho jane ke baad ise wine main mila sakate hai, is takanic ko sasarijrv ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 In this process wastewater, pomace and sediment are generated which require their collection, treatment and disposal or beneficial use
 angoor kii gunvattta kisi bhi anya pahalu se kahin adhik wine kii gunvattta ko nirdhaarit karata he
 The quality of the grape is influenced by its type as well as weather conditions, soil minerals and its acidity, timing of harvest and sorting in the order of the plant's growth
 in prabhaavon ko sanyukt rup se aksar angooron kaa terroir kahkar sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 Grape harvest from vineyards is generally obtained from early September to early November in the northern hemisphere or from mid-february to early March in the southern hemisphere
 dakshini golarddh main kuch thande kshetron jaise ki tasmania, australia aadi main may ke maheene tak fasal praapt kii jaati he
 The most common species of wine-making grape is Vitis vinifera which includes almost all varieties of European origin

 Grapes are harvested either mechanically or by hand
 angoor kii fasal praapt karne kaa nirnay aam taur par wine nirmaataaon dwaara liya jaataa he or iske liye sharkara ke str, acid or angoor ke piech kii jaankaree praapt kii jaati he
 Other considerations include phenological maturation, berry flavor, tannin development
 All the nature of grape vine and weather forecasts are taken into consideration
 yantric harvester bade tractor hote hai jinhen angoor kii belon kii jaafariyon ke saamne khadaa kar diya jaataa he or phir majboot plastic yaa rabar kii chad kaa upyog kar angoor kii bel ke fal lage kshetron main chot karte hai jisase ki angoor rekis se alag ho jate hai
 Mechanical harvesters have the feature that they cover a large area of the vineyard in a relatively short period of time and require a minimum number of workers for each ton of harvested
 yantric harvesting kaa ek nuksaan yah he ki is utpaada main bahari gaiyr-angoor vaali chijen vishesh rup se pattiyon kii daaliyaan or pattiyaan andhadhundh milaai jaati hai, lekin saath hi jaafaree pranali or angoor ke bel kii canopi ke prabandhan ke aadhaar par isamen kharaab angoor, kence, dhaatu ke malbe, chattaane or or yahan tak ki chote jaanwaron or chidiyon ke ghonsle shaamil ho sakate hai
 Some wine makers remove leaves and open debris from grape vines before mechanical harvesting to prevent the mixing of such items in harvested fruits
 sanyukt rajya america main falon ko andhadhundh tode jane or angoor ke ras ke zyada oxikaran ke kaaran ucch koti kii wine taiyaar karne ke liye yantric harvesting kaa upyog shaayad hi kabhi kiya jaataa he
 Other countries, mechanical harvesting of premium winegrapes is more commonly used due to the shortage of general workers

 The advantage of manual harvesting is that knowledgeable workers are used not only to break down ripe bunches of grapes but also to release raw bunches or clumps containing rotten grapes or other defective clusters
 yah wine ke ek bhandar yaa tanks ko nimna gunvattta ke fal se dooshit hone se rokane ke liye suraksha kaa pehla prabhavi upaay ho saktaa he
 Distemping is a process in which grape stems are separated from grapes
 wine banane ke tareeke ke aadhaar par taiyaar hone vaali wine main tannin ke vikaas or vanaspati ke jaayke ko kam karne ke uddeshy se angoor ko pise jane se pehle yah prakriya puri kii jaati he
 As with some German Trockenbierrenslies, this stage is ignored in single berry harvesting and the grapes are picked one by one
 krashing vah prakriya he jisamen beriyon ko acchhee tarah nichod liya jaataa he or beriyon ke tatwon ko alag karne kii prakriya shuru karne ke liye chhilkon ko todaa jaataa he
 Distemping is a process of separating grapes from grape rakis
 paaramparik or chote-paimaane par wine banane main harvest kiye gaye angooron ko kabhi-kabhi nange pairon se rond kar yaa saste chote str ke cresharon kaa istemaal kar inaki pisai kii jaati he
 They can also be decimated as well
 haalanki bade wineriyon main ek yantric krashar / distemar kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The decision of desteaming is taken differently to prepare red and white wine
 aam taur par white wine banaate samay keval fal kii pisai kii jaati he, iske baad tanon ko beriyon ke saath press main rakhaa jaataa he
 The presence of the stems in the mixture allows the juice to flow through the previously removed peels and exert pressure
 ye press ke kinare par jamaa ho jate hai
 Grape stems are typically taken out prior to fermentation to prepare red wine because the stems have a relatively high amount of tannin content; In addition to tannins, they can also give wines a botanical odor
 Sometimes when grapes themselves contain less tannin than expected, wine makers may decide to leave them out
 yah tab or adhik sweekaarya ho jaataa he jab tane "pake hue" hote hai or bhure rang main badalanaa shuru ho jate hai
 If a large amount of peels are required to be removed, the wine maker may opt for milling the grapes after destemming
 tanon ko pehle nikaalane kaa matlab he tanon ke tannin ko nikaala nahin ja saktaa he
 In these cases, the grapes are passed between two rollers, which squeeze the grapes so much that the peels and pulp are separated but not too much that the tissues of the grapes are severely cut or cut - Be sorted In some cases the whole or some portion of the grapes is left uncooked, in the case of remarkably "delicate" red varietals such as Peanut Noir or Saira to encourage the retention of fruit-like aroma through partial organic maceration
 
 zyaadaatar red wine apana rang angoor ke chhilkon se praapt karte hai or isiliye rang ko nikaalane ke liye ras or chhilake ke bich sampark hona aavashyak he
 Red wine is prepared in a tank by distemming and crushing the grapes and the peels are kept in contact with the juice during the entire process of fermentation
 bagaiyr pise hue falon par bahut teji se dabaav daalkar laal angooron se safed wine ko taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he
 This reduces contact between grape juice and peels
 zyaadaatar white wine disteming yaa krashing ke bagaiyr taiyaar kiye jate hai or inhen uthaane vaale dabbon se sidhe press main sthanantarit kar diya jaataa he
 This is done to avoid the release of tannins from peels or grape seeds in any way, as well as to maintain the proper flow of juice through a matrix of grape flakes instead of open berries
 kuch paristhitiyon main wine nirmaataa safed angooron ko thodi der ke liye, aam taur par teen se 24 ghanton ke liye chhilkon ke sampark main pisai kaa vikalp chun sakate hai
 This helps to remove the flavors and tannins from the peels, as well as the potassium ions that participate in the bitartite precipitate
 iske parinaam swaroop zeus kaa piech bhi bad jaataa he jo bahut adhik amleey angooron ke liye vaanchhneeya ho saktaa he
 It was a more common solution in the 1970s than it is today, although the method is still tried by some Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay producers in California
 rose vins ke maamle main falon kii pisai kii jaati he or gahare chhilkon ko ras ke sampark main utani der tak rahane diya jaataa he jab tak ki utana rang naa nikal aaye jitna ki wine nirmaataa chahta he
 The mast is then pressed and the fermentation process is completed as if the wine maker was preparing a white wine
 khamir saamaanya rup se pehle se hi angooron par maujuud rahati he jo aksar angooron ke buknidaar swaroop main dikhaai detaa he
 The fermentation process can be completed with this natural yeast but since it can give an unexpected result depending on the exact type of yeast present, the cultured yeast is often mixed with the mast
 wild ferments ke istemaal main aane vaali ek pramukh samasya he fermentation kii sampoorn prakriya puri hone main vifaltaa, jismin sharkara ke kuch avshesh fermentation ke bagaiyr rah jate hai
 When dry wine is to be obtained, it can make the wine sweet
 lagaataar wild ferments ke kaaran bai product ke rup main ek apriy acetic acid utpann ho saktaa he
 During primary fermentation, yeast cells thrive on the sugars present in the mast and this is why the production of carbon dioxide gas and alcohol is increased manifold
 kinvan ke dauraan taapmaana kaa str antim utpaada ke swaad ke saath-saath kinvan kii gati donon ko prabhavit karata he
 Temperatures typically range from 22 to 25 ° c for red wine and 15 to 18 ° c for white wine
 roopantarit kiye gaye prayek gram sharkara ke liye alcohol kii aadha gram maatra taiyaar hoti he, isiliye 12% kii alcohol sandratha praapt karne ke liye must main lagbhag 24% sharkara kii maatra maujuud honi chahie
 must main sharkara kii pratishat maatra kii gananaa maape gaye ghanatv, must ke vajan or ek vishisht prakaar ke hydrometer kii madad se kii jaati he jise sacarometer kehete hai
 If the amount of sugar in the grapes is very low, so that the desired percentage of alcohol is not achieved, then sugar can be added
 Commercialization in commercially made wine is subject to local regulations
 alcoholic fermentation ke dauraan yaa baad main melolactic fermentation kii prakriya bhi puri kii jaati he jiske dauraan bacteria ke vishisht strens mailic acid ko apekshaakrit halke lactic acid main badal dete hai
 This type of fermentation is often initiated by desired bacterial vaccines
 pressing angooron yaa angoor ke chhilkon se ras yaa wine alag karne ke kram main angooron yaa pomas par dabaav daalane kii ek prakriya he
 Pressing is not always an essential function in wine making, when milling the grapes, the juice separates immediately in sufficient quantities that can be used for vinification
 aam taur par yah free-ran zeus dabaakar nikaale gaye ras kii tulana main unnat koti kaa hota he
 However most wineries use presses to increase their per tonne production as the juice extracted from the press can represent 15% -30% of the total amount of juice extracted from the grapes
 press kii karypranali main angoor ke chhilkon yaa sabut angoor ke gucchhon ko ek kathor sthir sataha or ek gatisheel sataha ke bich rakhaa jaataa he or donon satahon ke bich aaytan dhire-dhire kam hota jaataa he
 Modern presses determine the time and pressure applied to each cycle press, which is typically controlled between 0 bar to 2
0
 kabhi-kabhi wine nirmaataa aise dabaav ko chunate hai jo press kiye gaye ras ke pravaah ko alag kar detaa he jise "press cat" taiyaar karnaa kehete he
 Since pressure increases the amount of tannin released from the peels that increases its amount in the juice, the pressed juice often becomes much tannic or hard
 beri main angoor ke ras ke tatwon kii sthiti ke kaaran press kiye gaye ras yaa wine main amla kii maatra kam ho jaati he or free-ran zeus kii tulana main iskaa piech maan zyada hota he
 Most presses before the start of wine production in the modern way were basket presses made of wood and were operated by hand
 basket press ek nirdhaarit plate ke upar lakdi ke slats ke ek silendar se bane hote hai jisamen ek chalyman plate hota he jise neeche kii ore dhakela ja saktaa he 
 press sanchaalak angooron yaa pomas ko lakdi ke silendar main bhar detaa he, upree plate ko apni jagah par rakh detaa he or ise tab tak neeche kiye rahata he jab tak kii ras lakdi ke slats se pravaahit nahin hone lagata he
 When the flow of juice decreases, the plate is then ratcheted down and brought down
 yah prakriya tab tak jari rahati he jab tak ki press sanchaalak yah nahin tay kar letaa he ki press kiye gaye ras yaa wine kii gunavata maanak str se kam ho gayi he yaa samoochaa ras dabaakar nikaal liya gaya he
 Since the early 1990s, modern mechanical basket presses have been revived through high-end producers seeking to replicate the historical basketball presses well
 kyonki basket press ek apekshaakrit compact dizin ke hote hai, press kek ras ke press se nikalne se pehle pravaahit hone ke liye ek apekshaakrit lanbaa maarg pradaan karata he
 Basket press advocates believe that this relatively long passage through a grape or pomace cake serves as a filter for solids that would otherwise affect the quality of press juice
 red wine ke maamle main praathmik kinvan ke baad mast ko press kiya jaataa he jo ghol main se chhilkon yaa anya thos padaarthon ko alag kar detaa he
 In the case of white wine, the solution is separated from the mast before fermentation
 rose wine ke maamle main wine ko rang dene ke liye chhilkon ko ek choti avadhi ke liye iske sampark main rahane diya jaataa he, aisi sthiti main must ko bhi press kiya ja saktaa he
 After the wine has been stored or allowed to grow for some time, the wine is separated from the dead yeast and any remaining solids and transferred to a new container where additional fermentation processes are completed
 Could
 piziyej khule kinvan tinkon main angooron kii paramparaagat stomping ke liye wine utpaadan kaa ek francisi shabd he
 To prepare certain types of wine, the grapes are put in a crusher and then the juice is extracted in open fermentation tanks
 kinvan shuru ho jane ke baad angoor ke chhilkon ko kinvan kii prakriya main nikle carbon dioxide gaison dwaara sataha kii ore dhakel diya jaataa he
 This layer of peels and other solids is known as cap
 chunki chhilake tannins ke strot hote hai, cap ko pratidin ghol main mishrit kiya jaataa he yaa paaramparik rup se waite ke madhyam se stomping dwaara "panch" kiya jaataa he
 Cold stabilization is a process used to reduce tartrate crystals from wine when making wine
 ye tartrate crystal ret ke saafe kanon jaise dikhaai dete hai or inhen "wine crystal" yaa wine "diamond" ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 They are formed by the combination of tartaric acid and potassium potassium and appear as sediments in wines, although they are not sediments
 kinvan ke baad sheet sthirikaran prakriya ke dauraan wine ke taapmaana ko 1-2 saptaah tak himank bindu tak gira diya jaataa he
 This causes the crystals to separate from the wine and stick to the edges of the pot
 jab wine paatr se nikaali jaati he tartrate paatr main hi rah jate hai
 They can also be made into bottles of wine that have been stored in extremely cold conditions
 "taap sthirikaran" ke dauraan asthir proteinon ko bentonite main avashoshit karke alag pruthak kar liya jaataa he, is tarah unhen bottleband wine main avakshepit hone se bachaaya jaataa he
 During the secondary fermentation and maturation process, which takes three to six months, the fermentation process continues very slowly
 wine ko oxikaran se bachaane ke liye wine ek vayurodhak main rakhi jaati he
 Proteins of grapes undergo fission and the remaining yeast cells and other fine particles are allowed to settle in the sediment
 potacium bitartrate bhi talachat main baith jayega, bottleband karne ke baad tartrate crystalon ko prakat hone se bachaane ke liye prakriya ko sheet sthirikaran ke zariye or badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 The result of these processes is that the smoky wine starts to appear clean
 mile ko hataane ke liye is prakriya ke dauraan wine ko nichoda bhi ja saktaa he
 Secondary fermentation typically occurs either in corrosion-resistant steel utensils with a volume of several cubic meters or in oak barrels, depending on the objectives of the wine producer
 ok rahit wine ko steneles steel yaa duusare aise padaarth ke baralon main kinvit kiya jaataa he jinka wine ke antim swaad par koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 icchit swaad ke anusaar ise steneles steel main kinvit karke thode samay ke liye ok main rakhaa ja saktaa he yaa phir puraa kinvan steneles steel ke bartan main hi kiya ja saktaa he
 Oak chips can be mixed in non-wooden barrels instead of fully wooden barrels
 yah prakriya mukhya rup se sasti wine main istemaal kii jaati he Amateur winemakers often use large glass bottles for wine production; The capacity of these bottles varies from 4
5 to 54 liters
 istemaal kiye jane vaale paatr kaa prakaar, banaai jane vaali wine kii maatra, istemaal kiye jane vaale angooron or wine nirmaataa ke iraadon par nirbhar karata he
 Melolactic fermentation occurs when bacteria of lactic acid metabolize malic acid to form lactic acid and carbon dioxide
 yah kriya yaa to swechha se puri kii jaati he jisamen vishesh rup se sanvardhit kiye gaye jeevanuon kii prajati ko paripakv ho rahi wine main milaayaa jaataa he yaa phir yah kriya sanyogvash bhi ho sakati he agar asanvardhit lactic amla ke jeevanu pehle se hi maujuud hon
 Melolactic fermentation can improve the taste of wines that have higher levels of malic acid as a higher concentration of malic acid generally leads to a feeling of tasteless and pungent taste, while lactic acid is considered more mild and less pungent
 yah prakriya adhiktar red wine main istemaal kii jaati he jabaki white wine main yah vivekadhin hoti he
 The wines are periodically tested in the laboratory to determine the status of the wine, whether it is maturing in tanks or in barrels
 saamaanya pareekshanon main °bricks, piech, titrateble acidity, avshisht sharkara, mukt yaa uplabdh sulfur, kul sulfur, vashpiya amlata or alcohol pratishat shaamil hai
 Additional tests include crystallization of cream of tartar and precipitating heat volatile proteins, this last test being limited to white wines only
 ye pareekshan aksar wine banane kii puri avadhi main or botaleekaran se pehle bhi sampadit kiye jate hai
 In response to the results of these tests, the wine maker can then decide on the correct treatment process, for example by adding a high amount of sulfur dioxide
 Sensitive tests are also carried out and then the wine maker can take remedial steps based on it
 Such as adding protein to soften the taste of wine
 bricks angoor ke ras main thos ghulansheel kaa ek maapak he or yah keval sharkara kaa hi nahin balki kai duusare ghulansheel padaarthon kaa bhi pratinidhitva karata he, jaise ki lavan, amla or tannin, jinhen kabhi-kabhi purna ghulansheel thos kaha jaataa he
 However, sugar is the most commonly occurring compound and therefore for all practical purposes these units are a measure of the sugar level
 angooron main sharkara kaa str keval isliye mahatvapurn nahin he ki yah wine main antim rup se alcohol ke ansh kaa nirdhaaran karata he balki isliye bhi ki yah angooron kii paripakvata kaa apratyaksh suchakank he
 Brix) is measured per 100 grams of solution, so 20 Bx means that 20 grams of soluble compounds are present in 100 grams of juice
 angooron main sharkara kii maatra ke duusare saamaanya maapak bhi hai, spacific gravity, ishle or bum 
 francisi bum main yah laabh he ki ek Bé° lagbhag ek pratishat alcohol kaa maan detaa he
 Also one Be ° is equal to 1
8 brix i
e
 1
8 grams of sugars per hundred grams
 This helps in deciding that if the sugar in the juice is low, then to get one percent alcohol, per 100 milliliters
 Add 1
8 grams or 18 grams per liter
 This process is called adaptation and is illegal in many countries
 Generally Bx between 20 and 25 is desirable for making dry table wine
 sharkara kii maatra ko dekhne ke liye turant sanket ank hasil karne ke kram main bricks pareekshan yaa to prayogshaala main yaa kheton main hi kiya ja saktaa he
 Brix is usually measured with a refractometer while other methods use a hydrometer
 saamanytah hidrometer ek sasta vikalp he
 For more accurate measurement of sugars, it is important to remember that all measurements are influenced by the temperature at which the reading is taken
 upkarnon ke aapurtikarta aam taur par sanshodhan chart uplabdh karavaate hai
 The volatile acidity test ensures any presence of acid distilled by the vapor in the wine
 acetic acid mukhya rup se maujuud hota he lekin lactic, butirik, propeonic or formik acid bhi paae ja sakate hai
 Generally this test tests these acids in a cache steel but new methods are available such as HPCL, gas chromatography and enzymatic method
 angooron main paayi jane vaali vashpashil amlata kii maatra naganya hoti he kyonki yah sookshmjivon ke upaapachay kaa ek bai-product hota he
 It is important to remember that acetic acid bacteria need oxygen to grow
 wine ke contenron main se hawa ko puri tarah nikaal lene ke alaava sulfur dioxide milaane se jeevanuon ke viksit hone kii gati niyantrit ho jaati he
 Acetic acid bacteria-related problems can also be avoided by removing bad grapes
 sulfur dioxide ke prayog or kam vaashp amla utpaadit karne vaale sacaromices ke ansh ko milaane se acetic acid utpaadan karne vaali khamir prabhavit ho sakati he
 a relatively new way to remove volatile acidity from wine is reverse osmosis
 sammishran se bhi madad mil sakati he - ucch vashpashil amlata vaali wine ko chaanakar kam vashpashil amlata vaali wine main milaayaa ja saktaa he taaki acetic acid kaa str samvedi seemaa se neeche rahe
 Wines of different batches can be mixed before bottling in order to achieve the desired taste
 wine nirmaataa vibhinn paristhitiyon main taiyaar kiye gaye vibhinn angooron or baichon ke vinon ko mishrit kar kathith kamiyon ko dur kar saktaa he
 Such adjustments can also be very simple, like adjusting acid or tannin levels and extremely complex like blending different varieties or vintages to achieve a consistent flavor
 wine utpaadan ke dauraan tannins ko hataane, kasaiylaapan ko dur karne or un sookshmdarshi kanon ko nikaalane ke liye jo wine ko kharaab kar sakate hai, fining agents kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Which financing agent to be used is decided by the wine manufacturer and can vary according to individual product and even by different batch
 wine utpaadan main gelatin kaa upyog sadiyon se kiya ja rahaa he or ise wine ke shodhan yaa shuddhikaran ke liye ek paaramparik vidhi ke rup main manyata di jaati he
 It is also the most commonly used agent for reducing the tannin element
 saamanytah wine main koi bhi gelatin bachaa nahin rah jaataa he kyonki yah wine ke tatwon ke saath pratikraya karata he, kyonki shuddhikaran ke baad yah ek talachat banaata he jise botling se pehle chaanakar nikaal diya jaataa he
 Apart from gelatin, other finishing agents for wine are often prepared from animal or fish products such as micronized potassium caseinate, egg whites, bone ash, ox blood, isinglass, PVPP, lysozyme and skim milk powder
 kuch sugandhi yukt vinon main shahad yaa andey ke yak se nikaale gaye tatv maujuud hote hai
 Non-animal-based filtering agents are also often used such as bentonite, diatomaceous earth, cellulose pads, paper filters, and membranous filters
 wine banane main istemaal hone vaale sabase aam parirakshak he sulfur dioxide jise sodium yaa potacium metabisulphate milakar praapt kiya jaataa he
 Another useful preservative is potassium sorbate
 sulfur dioxide ke do pramukh kaary hai, pehla yah ek sookshmjeev rodhi agent he or doosraa yah ek oxikaran rodhi he
 In preparing white wine, it can be added before fermentation and immediately after the alcoholic fermentation process is complete
 agar ise alcoholic farment ke baad milaayaa jaataa he to yah melolactic fermentation, bacteria ko hone vaale nuqasaan se bachaa saktaa he yaa ise roak saktaa he or oxigen ke hanikaarak prabhaavon ke khilaaf suraksha main madad kar saktaa he
 Up to 100 mg per liter may be added, but available or independent sulfur dioxide should also be measured by the aspiration method and adjusted to 30 mg per liter
 Available sulfur dioxide should be maintained at this level until bottling
 It can be mixed in small quantities for daily wines and the availability level should not exceed 30 mg per liter
 red wine taiyaar karne main rang ko sthir hone dene ke liye farment se pehle sulfur dioxide ko ucch staron par istemaal kiya ja saktaa he anyathaa ise melolactic farment kii samaapti par upyog kiya jaataa he or yah usee tarah kaary karata he jaisaa ki white wine main karata he
 However, to prevent bleaching of red spots, it should be used in small quantities and the sustainable level should be around 20 mg per liter
 In addition small amounts of it can be added to red wine after alcoholic fermant and before malolactic fermant to remove mild oxidation and prevent the growth of acetic acid bacteria
 sulfur dioxide ke upyog ke bina vins main aasaani se jeevanuon ke nasht hone kii samasya utpann ho sakati he, bhale hi wine taiyaar karne kaa tarika kitna hi svachh kyon naa ho
 Potassium sorbate is effective in controlling the growth of fungi, including yeast, especially for sweet wines sealed in bottles
 haalanki ek sambhavit khatra sorbett ke metabolism se ek potent ke jeraneole kaa he or yah bahut hi apriy upotpaada he
 To avoid this, either the wine should be sterilized and bottled or it should contain enough sulfur dioxide to stop the growth of bacteria
 Sterile bottling also involves the use of filtering
 wine banane main filtereshan kaa istemaal do uddeshyon ko puraa karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, shuddhikaran or sookshmjeev sthirikaran
 shuddhikaran main wine ke pratyaksh swarup ko prabhavit karne vaale bade kanon ko hataa liya jaataa he
 Microbial stabilization removes organisms affecting the stability of the wine and therefore reduces the possibility of re-fermentation or spoilage
 shuddhikaran kii prakriya kaa sambandh kanon ko hataane se he; khurdari policing ke liye jo 5-10 micrometer se zyada bade hote hai, shuddhi yaa policing ke liye jo 1-4 micrometer se zyada bade hote hai
 Microbial stabilization requires at least 0
65 micrometer filtering
 haalanki is str par filtereshan wine ke rang or swarup ko halkaa kar sakate hai
 Microorganism stabilization does not indicate sterility
 iskaa sidhaa sa matlab yah he ki ek paryaapt maatra main khamir or bacteria ko hataa liya gaya he
 Some amounts of sulfite are added at the end to make the wine safe and to prevent unwanted fermentation in the bottle
 iske baad wine kii botalon ko paaramparik rup se cork ke jariye silband kiya jaataa he, haalanki wine ko bottleband karne ke liye vaikalpik upaay bhi aajamaae jate hai jaise ki synthetic cork or scrucap, jiname cork kii gandagi aane kii sambhaavna kam hoti he or ye teji se lokapriy ho rahe hai
 Finally a capsule is placed at the end of the bottle and heated to seal it firmly
 paramparaagat rup se inhen wintner ke ke naam se janaa jaataa he; wine ke utpaadan main shaamil vyakti ko winemekar kaha jaataa he

 Thus the Chola Empire's war with the Srivijaya Empire came to an end in which Tambreling and Srivijaya were heavily destroyed

 Care of the patient is called care or nursing
 angreji ke nurse shabd kaa arth he 'poshan'
 The nurse is the woman who nurtures the baby; The mother is also a nurse, the male is also a nurse who takes care of the infants or the patient
 paricharya shabd se kriyasheeltaa jhalkati he
 It is a work of benevolence and done for a person who cannot do it for himself
 yon to paricharya ek vyavsaay he, parantu isamen aisi charitravan striyon kii aavashyaktaa rahati he jo ishwariya niyamon main drudh nishtha rakhti hon or jo satya siddhanton par atal rahen tathaa parinaam kii chintaa kiye bina, kaise bhi paristhiti kyon na ho, vahi karen jo uchit ho
 The history of nursing starts from the ancient times of the Vedas, when the work of caring for the sick person and the beginning was seen with great respect in the society
 charak ne lagbhag 1,000 i
pus
 main likhaa tha ki upachaarika ko shuddh aacharan kii, pavitra, chatur or kushal, dayavan, rogi ke liye sab prakaar kii seva karne main daksh, pakashastra main guni, rogi ke prakshalan tathaa snaan karaane, maalish karne, uthaane tath tahalaane main nipun, bichhaavan bichaane or svachh karne main praveen, tatpar, dhairyavan, rog se peedit kii paricharya main kushal or aagyaakaari hona chahie
 The famous Greek physician Hippocrates, who is considered the father of medicine, knew the importance of properly caring for the patient and also knew how to take good care
 aarambh-kaaleen isai charchasangh ke samay striyaan apane ghar baar chhodkar rogiyon tathaa sankatagrast logon kii seva shushrusha karne athwa unhen dekhne-bhaalane jaaya karti thim
 Florence Nightingale laid the foundation of the ancient care
 ye dhani ghar kii ladki thim, parantu aalas jivan se asantusht hokar unhone paricharya kaa adhyayan kiya or landan main rogiyon ke liye ek paricharya bhawan kholaa
 In 1845, when the war broke out in Crimea and at the behest of the Secretary of War, at the age of 34, she went to the battle site with a team of 38 nurses for service
 swasthya vigyaan ke siddhanton ko unhone aspataal ke prabandh main lagu kiya or uske liye jo bhi kathinaaiyaan yaa adchane unke maarg main ain
 He faced them relentlessly with valor and prudence, even the opposition of military commissarial officers

 But as a result of his management, the death toll in Barrack's hospitals, which was 42 per cent earlier, came down to 2 per cent in June 1855

 The work he did there became a surprising story of that era

 The news of his arrival spread among the people after his arrival
 san 1860 main unke prayaas se landan main nurson ke liye ek paathshaala khuli, jo is prakaar kii pehali paathshaala thi
 The first nursing schools in India opened in Madras in 1854 and Bombay in 1860

 Now there is a system of training of nurses in almost all major hospitals of the country, through which diploma in general care is also available
 paricharya mahavidhyalayon main snaatakon ko bi
es-si kii oopaadhi di jaati he tathaa metranon or sistar anushikshakon ko wardenon ke sambandh main sankshipt shiksha kii vyavastha kii jaati he
 Since the time of Florence Nightingale, there has been a lot of advancement in medical science, which has also led to radical changes in nursing science
 ab yah dharmik vyavasthaapakon ke protsaahan se sanchalit evam anbhigya vyaktiyon dwaara dayaa-dakshinya-prerit seva maatr nahin rah gaya he;ab to yah aajeevika kaa ek saadhan he, jiske liye vistrut vaigyanik paathyakram kaa adhyayan or shikshan aavashyak hota he
 In most of the professions in which success is achieved through personal skills and scientific training, it is characterized that successful compassion is needed, calm and grief to relieve grief and heart like mother
 apane rogi ke prati upachaarika ke daayitv kii aadhunik bhaavana main keval shaareerik sukh dene, chikitsa karne tathaa aushadhopchaar ke atirikt isaki bhi apeksha rahati he ki use rog kaa tathaa vah rog kisi rogi ko kis prakaar prabhavit karata he, iskaa bhi spasht gyaan ho
 He should be very alert to the new signs that emerge from time to time
 kis prakaar ke upachaar se rogi ko laabh hoga, iskaa use gyaan hona chahie tathaa prayek rogi ke liye alag-alag kis prakaar kii dekhbhaal apekshit he tathaa uski paricharya kis prakaar kii jaae, in sabakaa use spasht pataa hona chahie
 It is also necessary for the nurse to be familiar with the state of mind of her patients in order to fulfill her duties fully
 rogi kii dekhbhaal karne main keval rog par drushti rakhana hi paryaapt nahin he, varan rogi ko aisa vyakti samajhnaa chahie jo upachaarika se yah apeksha karata he ki vah use suraksha de, use samajhe tathaa usapar mamata rakhe
 Therefore, the yoga of nurses is very important in the prevention of diseases and in the care of those suffering from them
 vah chikitsa ke liye sahayika tathaa sahyogini he
 Without him, the doctor may face great difficulties in assisting the patient
 kabhi-kabhi to vah doctor se bhi adhik mahatv kii ho jaati he
 Today, nurses undoubtedly make an active contribution by giving proper yoga along with the doctor in a social and preventive program related to medicine that can truly improve the health of the individual or the nation
 paricharya vyavsaay main mukhyat: striyaan hi kaam karti hai
 Today she can say with satisfaction that her work is a respected work, because her life is spent in making the lives of others useful and happy
 unako is vyavsaay main swaabhaavik rup se anand or aatmasantosh miltaa he kyonki ve ek pardu:khapahaari tathaa sammanpurn kaam main sanlagn rahati hai
 Nurses are given special clothes

 His uniform is formal attire; It consists of white frock, white cap, apron and thong, and white shoes and socks
 aabhushan ke rup main keval ghadi unke paas rahati he
 New nurses prefer to wear white sarees instead of frocks as per the changing form of care
 yah vesh sada to he hi, pahananevaaliyon ke liye or jinaki shushrusha main ve lagi rahati hai unke liye bhi prabhavotpadak hota he
 Modern nursing work can be divided into several classes
 saadhaarant: prayek nurse ek varg kii visheshgy hoti he
 The major categories of work of nurses are: social and public health care, hospital care, industrial field care, nursing care and private medical care
 paricharya ke kitne hi upavibhag bhi hai, udaahranarth, aspataal main chikitsa-prakaar ke anusaar paricharya ke ye vibhaag ho jate hai-balak kii paricharya, hridrog paricharya, asthikarm paricharya, kshay paricharya, garbh vishyak paricharya, saamaanya aushadhopchaarik tathaa shalya chikitsaki paricharya, mastishk rogon kii paricharya, chhot ke rogon kii paricharya ityadi
 Nurses have to do a very important job in building a healthy nation
 rog kii anupasthiti ko hi swasthya nahin kehete, swasthya to nishchit rup se rahane kaa arthath us sthiti kaa naam he jisamen purna shaareerik, maansik tathaa saamaajik hrishthata ho
 After recuperating in the hospital, returning the patient to the same unhygienic environment as before, cannot be considered any progress towards building a healthy nation
 chaturdik swasthya kii bhaavana nurson ko logon tak pahunchaani padegi or unhen yah samajhnaa padegaa ki yadi swatchta rakhi jaae to du:kha kaa adhikansh bhaag apane aap dur ho jayega
 It is only nurses who can give people a good way to lead a healthy life
 unhen rogi or uske parivaar kaa un baton kii shiksha or buddhi deni chahie jisase ve nurse ke bidaa ho jane ke baad bhi apana ghar dwaar acha rakh saken
 The nurse nurse has to bear the entire responsibility of the new visitor, and therefore does not have to start his work when the child is born, but his work starts nine months before his birth
 janm se purv, janm ke samay, shishav, baalyavastha tathaa kishoravastha main, vah jaise bhi or jahaan bhi ho, ghar main, skool main, aspataal main, gali main, maidan main, sabhi jagah use balak kii sambhaal kerani padati he
 He has to help the parents and see that the child overcomes all difficulties
 use shikshak, paramarshdaata tathaa mitra kii haisiyat baratani hoti he
 Every nurse of child care needs special knowledge and more skills of child care so that she can take care of them scientifically
 bachche ke liye vah samay sabase adhik sankat kaa hota he jab use aspataal main laayaa jaataa he
 He leaves his mother and reaches a new world, where he does not know what is to be done to him
 uskaa kshubdh maansik santulan tathaa vikal manoveg use beemaari se kahin adhik santrast karte hai
 In such a situation, the importance of personal care in the hospital is more than the treatment
 balak paricharya kii nurse kaa hi yah mukhya kaary hota he ki vah bachche kaa vishwaas praapt kar le or use sab baaten pehle se hi saaf-saaf bataa de jisase vah chikitsak dwaara chikitsa tathaa honevaale kaaryon ke liye taiyaar ho jaae
 If something is done accidentally without telling the child in advance, he definitely opposes it
 hridrog paricharya kii nurse ke vishesh uttardaayitv hote hai or vaisaa hi uskaa prashikshan hota he
 Many diseases of the heart do not take necessary precautions in relation to their disease after the initial pain has subsided
 jo nurse rogi kaa ullekhneey vishwaas tathaa apane upar purna nirbharta praapt kar le, jo rogi kii shaareerik mudraon kaa abhipraay samajhe, jo apni rahan-sahan ko is prakaar dhaal sake ki rogi ko pareshaani na ho, vahi nurse hridapacharya ke liye yogya or safal siddh ho sakati he
 Nurses require a lot of skill to handle mental patients
 rogiyon ke bich nurse ko bahut saavdhaanee se apana kaam karnaa padataa he
 His behavior and his intimate care are definitely more useful than any medicine for the patient
 nurse ko rogi ke sambandh main prayek prakaar kaa gyaan hona chahie or un baton kaa to use avashya hi bhalee prakaar pataa hona chahie, jisase rogi kaa maansik santulan bighad jaataa he
 He has to deal with patients with patience, empathy and skill, as if they are his friends and loved ones, because the mental patients get out of the ordinary thing and all the little treatment and treatment they get
 Can destroy profits in an instant
 ye nurson kii vishesh dakshata ke kuch udhaaharan hai
 The nurse has some special duties in each particular area
 usko paricharya kaa laabh tabhi ho saktaa he jab use sthiti kaa sampurna gyaan ho
 But whatever the situation, the same and according to the instructions of the doctor, one has to work like a true servant of the patient

 at: swaryantr or vaadyayantra kii rachana main bhi kuch samanta he
 Humans and other mammals have the following parts equivalent to the wind speed instruments: 1
 kanpak isamen swar rajjuen bhi sammilit hai
 2
 Resonant components include the following components: 3
 spasht uccharak avyav - isamen nimnlikhit ang sammilit hai : The above mentioned functions in the genesis of the vowel work as follows: When the pleural constricts in a state of exhalation, the ejaculated air reaches the larynx through the ventricle, where by its effect the larynx in the larynx begins to vibrate, which results in Vowel originates
 thik isi samay anunadak arthath swaryantr kaa upree bhaag, grasani, mukh tathaa nasa apni apni kriyaaon dwaara swar main visheshta tathaa mriduta utpann karte hai
 After this, the words of the said vowel are pronounced in the form of pronunciation ie soft, hard palate, tongue, teeth and lips
 inhen sab ke sahyog se spasht shuddh swaron kii utpatti hoti he
 This is a composition made by the connection of cartilage tied to muscle and Achilles tendon
 yah ek upar neeche chhidravala mukutakaar rachana he jo gale ke sammukh bhaag main shwaasanlee ke shikhar par rahata he or jiske dwaara shwaasavayu kaa pravesh hota he tathaa kanth se swar nikalataa he
 It is surrounded by muscles and can be felt under the skin
 yah upar kanthikasthi or neeche shwaasanlee se mila he
 The larynx is made up of nine cartilages consisting of three single large subunits and three pairs of subunits
 yah swaryantr kii pradhan upasthi he, jiskaa aakaar faile hue yugma pankh ke samaan hota he
 Its bulge from outside is visible in puberty, especially in men
 iske donon pankh madhyarekha ke donon ore hai or sammukh main kone banaakar peeche kii ore faile hue hai
 There are two horns on top of it
 upar ke shringon main kanthikasthi ke donon parshv jude hai tathaa neeche ke donon shrungavalay upasthi se milte hai
 The root of the epiglottis is at the top of the ventricle of both wings
 in sab rachanaaon ke chaaron taraf choti badi mansapeshiyaan aachhadit rahati hai
 This is the cartilage below the larynx, which is similar in size to the ring
 iske do bhaag hote hai jinamein sammukh kaa bhaag patala or gol he or peeche kaa bhaag sthool or chaudaa he
 The lower part of the cartilage above the frontal portion and the lower part of the trachea are connected by the mucous membrane at the bottom
 pashchim bhaag ke peeche madhya rekha main annanali kaa sammukh bhaag he
 The muscles on both sides are covered
 isi prakaar swaryantr kii anya pramukh upaasthiyon main kumbhakaar upasthi, kilak upasthi tathaa shrungi hai, jo chaaron taraf se mansapeshiyon se bandhi rahati hai tathaa swar kii utpatti main sahaayak hoti hai
 These are four in number which extend from front to back within the larynx
 yah ek reshedaar rachana he jisamen anek sthitisthaapak reshe bhi hote hai
 Looks bright and bright
 isamen upar kii donon tantriyaan gaun tathaa neeche kii mukhya kehalaati hai
 There is a triangle recess in the middle of it, which is called Kanthadwar
 inhen rajjuon ke khulne or band hone se naanaa prakaar ke vicitra swaron kii utpatti hoti he
 During respiration the ropeway is open and is wide and triangular
 saans lene main yah kuch adhik chaudaa tathaa shwaas chhodane main kuch sankeern ho jaataa he
 While speaking, the ropes attract and come close together and their gate becomes very narrow
 jitna hi swar ucch hota he, utana hi rajjuon main aakarshan adhik hota he or dwaara utana hi sankeern ho jaataa he
 Along with the growth of the larynx, the length of the larynx increases due to which the tone becomes heavier in puberty
 swarrajjuen striyon kii apeksha purushon main adhik lambii hoti hai
 The sound is generated when the vocal cords vibrate at the velocity of the stirred air
 yahan swar ek hi prakaar kaa utpann hota he kintu aage chalakar taalu, jihva, danta or oshth aadi avyavon ke sampark se usamen parivartan aa jaataa he
 The nature of the sound produced by the vibration of the vocal cords depends on the following three things: 1
 prabalata - yah kampan tarangon kii ucchata ke anusaar hota he
 2
 Coherence - It occurs according to the number of vibrational waves
 3
 gunata - yah gunjansheel sthanon ke vistaar ke anusaar badalata rahata he or kampan tarangon ke swaroop par nirbhar hota he
 Uddālaka was one of the greatest philosophers of the Upanishad era
 ye gautam gotreey aruni rishi ke putr the or isiilie 'aaruni' ke naam se vishesh prakhyat hai
 In the Mahabharata, he has been described as a disciple of the sage Dhaumya and an ideal disciple for his singular gurus service
 
 It is generally believed that the Greek Saint Thales was the pioneer of science
 kintu prasiddh itihaaskaar debiprasad chattopadhyaay ne siddh kiya he ki vastav main thels nahin balki uddalak pratham chintak the jinhone gyaan prapti ke liye prayog kii aavashyaktaa kaa pratipaadan kiya tha
 Many students lived in Rishi Dhaumya's ashram
 vah unhen puri tatparta se padhaate, saath hi unki kadi pariksha bhi lete rahete the
 In these exams, different criteria were set and it would be seen how loyal the student was to the learning and master
 ek din musaladhar varsha ho rahi thi
 The Guru told one of his students Aruni, 'son! The water is being drained out due to the breaking of the ridge of the field, so go and tie the weir
 ' aaruni tatkaal uth khadaa hua or khet kii ore chal diya
 The flow of water was fast
 aaruni ne mitti jamaane kii koshish kii par bahaav rukaa nahin
 Seeing no solution, Aruni lay down at that place
 is prakaar usne pani ko roak diya magar bahaav or varsha ke veg se vah behosh ho gaya
 Even after many nights passed, when he did not return, Dhaomya was worried
 vah khet par use dhundne pahunche
 On seeing it, Aruni stopped the water and lay near the ridge
 dekhte hi guruji bhavvibhor ho gaye
 a detailed discussion of the spiritual ideas of Aruni has been done in a very interesting way in the Chandogya and Brihadaranyaka Upanishads
 tatvavettaon ke itihaas main aaruni kaa pad yajyavlky ke hi samakaksh mana jaataa he jo inke shishy hone ke atirikt upanishatkaaleen darshanikon main ni:sanshay sarvshereshth maane jate hai
 Regarding psychological facts, Aruni believes that for the main purpose of sleep is 'labor', and in the state of sleep, the organism takes on communion with the soul
 mrityukalin chetana ke vishay main aaruni kaa kathan he ki jab manushya marataa he, tab uski vaakman main antarleen ho jaati he; ananthar man praan main, praan tej main tathaa ant main tej devtaa main antarleen ho jaataa he 
 Yajnavalkya has taken this theory from here and has elaborated it
 tatvagyan ke vishay main aaruni ke siddhant ko ham 'pratyayvaadee' addhait kaa naam de sakate hai, kyonki inaki drushti main advait hi ekmaatr sat tathaa tathy he
 The theory of Aruni is the connotation of metaphysical sentence, which he explained and proved by his son Shvetketu through many entertaining illustrations
 'idan sarv tat satyam sa aatma tatvamasi shwethaketo'-aaruni ke advaitvaad kaa yah mahneey mantra he 
 The basic element is the 'sat' form, not the non-discrete form, because there can be no origin of any kind from discrete
 yah sat apane main se pehle agni ko, peeche jal ko tathaa ant main prithvi ko isi kram se utpann karata he
 This 'trinity' element of the universe is the self-realized principle of Aruni
 vishwa ke prayek dravya main ye teenon tatv vidyaman rahete hai
 All substances are immaterial
 padaarthon apeksha tatwon kii satyata sarvatha maanya he or in tatwon kii apeksha satyatar he vah sat jo inkaa mul kaaran he 
 It is an astral and base microcosm in all systems of the world
 iskaa purna gyaan acharya ke dwaara di gai shiksha ke dwaara or shraddha ke dwaara praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 'acharyavan Purusho Veda' = Only the man who is assigned by the Guru knows the ultimate element; This sermon of Aruni is the cornerstone of gurutva
 aatma vishwa ke prayek padaarth main usee prakaar vyaapt rahata he, jis prakaar us jal ke prayek kan main lavan vyaapt rahata he jisamen vah daalaa jaataa he 
 This spiritual vision of Uddālaka Aruni is a complete reflection of the monotony and comprehensiveness of the soul

 Justice Shri Prem Shankar Gupta did a commendable job of passing judgment in Hindi and became very famous due to this
 ve ucch nyaayalay ke adhivaktaa, nyaayadhish evam hindi ke prabal pakshdhar va manishi ke rup main jane jate hai
 Hindi, other Indian languages and literature are his heartbeat
 raashtra bhakthi unke saanskrithik vyaktitv ko ek mukhar tejaswita pradaan karti he or rashtrabhasha ke liye unki patibaddhta unke vyaktitv ko vishesh rup se paribhaashit karti he
 Justice Prem Shankar Gupta is a law graduate from Allahabad University
 nyaayadhish niyukt hone se purv unhone bharat ke rajya or centre sarkaron main adhivaktaa ke rup main kaam kiya
 In 1977, he was appointed as a permanent judge of the Allahabad High Court
 unhone tabhi se nyaayadhish ke rup main rajbhasha hindi main apane nirnay dena prarambh kiya tha or apane lagbhag 15 varsh ke kaarykaal main unhone lagbhag 4000 nirnay hindi bhashaa main die
 He was honored on many occasions for his commendable work
 nyaayamurti shri gupt ji kaa janm uttar pradesh ke ek chote se jile itawa main ek pratishthit vaisya parivaar main dinaank 15 july 1930 ko hua tha
 After completing his primary education in Etawah city, he graduated from Allahabad University and then graduated in law
 elahabaad vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr ke rup main hi prem shankar ji saahitiyik evam saanskrithik gatividhiyon se jud gayi
 He embraced law with a sincere heart and started working as a lawyer in the legal profession from 1951 in his home town Etawah and registered as a lawyer in the year 1962
 kuch hi samay main unhone adhivaktaa ke rup main apni ek vishesh pahchaan bana lee
 The Government of Uttar Pradesh appointed you District Government Advocate Etawah in the year 1964
 jis pad par aap varsh 1971 tak kushalta se kaary karte rahe
 In the early nineteen seventies, after leaving full advocacy in Etawah in the Gupta district and came to advocate in Allahabad, the High Court at that time had dominion of English and one could not imagine that the High Court could also argue in Hindi It may be, but Mr
 Gupta testified that talent is not a special language and the expression made in our own language Arguments made in English may be more effective
 sheeghra hi gupt ji ko uttar pradesh shashan ne upashaskeey adhivaktaa, ucch nyaayalay elahabaad, phir shaskeey adhivaktaa khand peeth lakhanu va baad main shaskeey adhivaktaa ucch nyaayalay elahabaad niyukt kiya
 He continued in this post from 1971 to 1977

 Earlier, in the appeal of the famous criminal case of Shamim Rahmani, Mr
 Gupta had submitted his arguments in Hindi language on behalf of the state in the High Court Allahabad which is recalled in the High Court

 The description of this journey of law field is definitely incomplete without showing your Hindi love
 nyaayamurti ke rup main aapkaa rashtrabhasha hindi ke prati yogadan amuly rahaa he
 You started giving the decision in Hindi, deviating from the convention of passing judgment in traditional English in the High Court
 hindi premiyon ke liye yah ek prerana kaa shrot tha
 As a result, in the High Court, where work was done only in English language, lawyers and officials started working in Hindi
 aapane 15 varsh ke apane nyaayamurti ke kaarykaal main lagbhag 4 hajaar se adhik nirnay rashtrabhasha hindi main dekar ek kirtiman sthapit kiya he
 He had received Hindi love of Justice Shri Prem Shankar Ji in his childhood
 itawa ke sanathan dharm skool main jab ve adhyayanrat the tabhi unki kaksha ke adhyaaapak unke guru swargeey shri shishupal singh bhadauria ́shishu ́ ne swatantrata aandolan ke samay rachit apni bhavpurn evam ojasvi kavitaaon ke madhyam se vidhyaarthiyon main raashtra prem evam rashtrabhasha prem kaa jo beej boyaa use nyaayamurti shri gupt ji ne apane jivan main purnat: aatmsaat kar liya evam jivan paryant usee main ve ram gayi
 The poem of his initial Guru Shri 'shishu ji' which makes him very distressed and touched is as follows: suno gaur se, to sunaane ke kaabil Jee wants to tell the story
 kisi kaa nahin hu¡ hathila virdohi i am not even bought by anyone
 na bandi kinhin vaad ke bandhanon kaa Where Vyom is free i am right there
 magar santulan main kisi kii paristhiti Where i see the hurt, kafan main vahiin laal chhiten chhidak kar Jee wants to fly the flag
 suno gaur se to, sunaane ke kaabil Jee wants to tell the story
 ́ Along with the late Shishu ji, the honor of Shri Vallabh ji was received by Justice Shri Gupta in his school Sanadharma
 shri gupt, ́vallabh ji ́ kii desh prem kii nimna kavita se atyant prabhavit hokar swatantrata ke aandolan main bhi sammalit huye, Goodbye, give me free now mujhako is muj bandhan se
 My heart breaks, maatr bhoomi ke krandan se, Just say when the war broke out, chaaron ore desh bhar main, Then beautifies the youth, kya baithe rahanaa ghar main
 i want to drink this cup, ras na sahi vishadhaar sahi, i need someone to throat tum na sahi talwaar sahi
 Listen, Ranbheri is playing kolahal dhwani chai he, If you survive, then athwa yahi vidaai he
 ́ raashtra kavi ramdhaari singh dinakar kehete the ki hindi ko abhi sammaan milanaa shesh he
 Hindi needs to sweat not blood, only then its real progress can be possible
 prem shankar ji ke dwaara is ore kiya gaya parishram saraahneey he
 Apart from your amazing work of giving decision in Hindi, it has been your belief that Hindi and other Indian languages should be used freely and artificially in the field of law
 hindi ke bahut se clisht shabdon kaa vyarth main prayog karnaa uchit nahin he
 After retirement, you were completely engaged in the upliftment of Hindi and protecting your honor with body and mind

 vidhi kshetra main unhone apane hindi prem evam apni bhartiya saanskriti ke prati nishtha kaa vilakshan parichay diya he

 angreji bhashaa par bhi unka acha adhikaar hote hue aapane rajya bhashaa main apane nirnay likhakar sabhi deshavaasiyon ko ek nai disha di he
 At the root of this direction, the main mantra of personal language advancement has been continuously spoken

 He is a retired Justice, but this holiday is still dedicated to the national language and national culture

 You have always kept the people shaken in every program with your simple, sobering and energetic speech

 2004 main, bhartiya chunaavon main 670 million matadaataaon ne bhaag liya or iskaa ghoshit kharch 1989 ke mukaable teen guna badhkar $300 million ho gaya
 More than a million electronic voting machines were used in these elections
 2009 ke chunaavon main 714 million matadaataaon ne bhaag liya 
 In view of the large number of voters, it has become necessary to hold elections in several stages
 chunaavon kii is prakriya main charanbaddh tareeke se kaam kiya jaataa he, isamen bhartiya chunaav ayog dwaara chunaavon kii tithi kii ghoshnaa, jisase rajnatik dalon ke bich "adarsh aachaar samhita" lagu hoti he, se lekar parinaamon kii ghoshnaa or safal ummidavaaron kii suchi rajya yaa centre ke kaaryakari pramukh ko saunpna shaamil hota he

 This increased the importance of strong regional parties, which until now had been limited to regional aspirations only
 ek taraf jahaan tedepa or annadramuk jaise dal paaramparik rup se majboot kshetreey daavedaar bane hue the vahiin duusari ore 1990 ke dashak main lok dal, samaajawaadee party, bahujan samaaj party or janata dal jaise anya kshetreey dalon kaa bhi udai hua
 These parties were traditionally based on regional aspirations, or based entirely on caste

 Any party or coalition is required to prove its majority in the House during a confidence vote by obtaining a simple majority of votes in the House
 bharat ke kuch shaharon main, online matadaata panjikaran farm praapt kiye ja sakate hai or nikatatam chunavi karyaalay main jamaa kiye ja sakate hai
