 'intaraashtriya maanakeekaran sanghathan, jise adhiktar ISO kaha jaataa he, vibhinn rashtron ke maanak sanghathanon ke pratinidhiyon se gathit ek anterrashtriya maanak-vinyas sanstha he
 It was established on February 23, 1947, to declare worldwide industrial and commercial standards
 iskaa mukhyalay geneva, switzraland main sthit he
 Although ISO calls itself an NGO, its ability to set standards, which often become law, either by agreements, or national values; This makes it more powerful than ngos
 vaise vyavhaar main yah ek sankaay yaa alpakaaleen sanghathan jaise karyrat he, jisaki sarkaron se majboot kaniyaan hai
 
 is sanghathan kaa logo yaa chihn do aadhikarik bhashaaon main he amareeki angreji evam french
 It also contains ISO characters, which it is often known as, which is its abbreviation
 balki yah sankshipti unani / greek shabd ἴσος se bana he, jiskaa arth he baraabar
 Assuming that the organization will have a different concatenation in different languages, it decided to run an all-encompassing universal name ISO
 yah swayan main is sanghathan kaa uddeshy siddh karata he
 The main products of ISO are international standards
 ISO dwaara hi prakashit hai : takneekee report, takneekee vishesheekaran, saarvajanik uplabdh vishesheekaran, takneekee shuddhipatr, evam and pathpradarshak
 The international standard is interpreted as the ISO xxrep 5 n heading, where xxrep 5 n is the standard number, xxrep 4 y is the year of publication, and the heading indicates the subject
 If the standard is the result of the work of the Joint Technical Committee JTC1, then the IEC is also included
 ASTM International ke sahyog se viksit maanakon main ASTM ko bhi sammilit kiya jaataa he
 The use of dates and iss is incompatible for incomplete or unpublished standards, and in some circumstances the title of a published work may also be omitted
 takneekee report jari hoti he, jab koi takneekee samiti yaa up-samiti ne saamanyatya prakashit anterrashtriya maanak se bhinn prakaar kaa koi aankana sangrahit kiya ho, jaise ki sandarbh yaa vyakhyaayein
 Their naming conventions are similar to the standards, only TR is applied instead of IS, before the report name
 udhaahrantah The technical specialization can be composed when "the subject concerned is still in development, or for some other reason there is a possibility of consent to publish an international standard in the future"
 saarvajanik uplabdh vishesheekaran koi "madhyavarti vishesheekaran ho sakate hai, jo ki purna anterrashtriya maanak ke vikaas se purv hi prakashit hua ho", yaa, IEC main 'dwicihn' prakaashan, jo ki kisi bahari sanghathan ke sahyog se prakashit hua ho " donon ke hi namakaran takneekee report kii bhaanti hi kiya jaataa he
 For example ISO kabhi kabhi takneekee / paribhaashik shuddhipatr bhi jari karata he
 These are amendments to the current standards, which are made for petty technical / technical errors, usability improvements, or limited applicability
 praayah inhen is aashaa ke saath jari kiya jaat he ki prabhavit maanak yato uddhrut yaa waapas liya jayega, apane agle anusoochna panravlokan tak
 ISO guides are quasi-standard, with subjects related to international standardization
 in kaa namakaran "ISO Guide N: xxrep 4 y : sheershak" main hota he, udhaahrantah ISO documents are copyright protected, and ISO values most copies
 vaise adhiktar ke mulya keval electronic roopakar main hi liye jate hai
 Although useful, but using these documents, it is worth noting that they are also likely to change in abundance, before it becomes a standard
 ISO evam iske aadhikarik sanyukt rajya pratinidhi evam anterrashtriya vidyutatakneekee ayog dwaara kuch maanak ni:shulk uplabdh karaae jate hai
 ISO has 157 national members, out of the 195 total countries in the world
 ISO kii teen sadsyta shreniyan hai: Participating members are called "P" or p members, while the compliant members are called "O" or o members
 is tathy ne, ki kai iso-srujit maanak sarvgat, sarvyaapee hai; kai maukon par, "ISO" kaa saamaanya prayog prerit kiya he, us utpaada ko varnit karne hetu, jo ki maanakon ko maanata he
 There are many examples of this: maanakeekaran ke kshetron main, prachur aachhadan ke parinaamon se, evam soochna praudyogiki se sambandhit karyon se, nibatane hetu; ISO evam IEC yaa anterrashtriya vidyutatakneekee ayog se ek sanyukt takneekee samiti gathit kijise ISO / IEC JTC1 ke nam se janaa jaataa he
 This AC is the first committee, and is the same till date
 iskaa aadhikarik aadesh he, vishwavyaapee bazaaron main vyapaar evam upayokta kii aavashyaktaaon hetu, IT maanakon kaa vikaas, anurakshan, prachaar karnaa
 At present there are 18 sub-committees: - ISO / IEC JTC1 kii sadsyta bilkul va lagbhag apane donon mul sanghathanon kii bhaanti hi pratibandhit he
 a member can be either a participant or an observer
 donon main keval prastaavit maanakon evam anya utpaadon par matdaan kii kshamta kaa hi bhed he
 There is no need for a member institution to maintain a level / opinion on any or every sub-committee
 yadhyapi yada-kada, parantu nai parsesthitiyon se saamana karne hetu up-samitiyaan gathit kii ja sakati hai, yaa bhang bhi kii ja sakati hai, yadi unka kaary kshetra ab lagu nahin he
 International Workshop Agreement, such as ISO / TS, International Workshop Agreement is also another arsenal of isos, in areas where technical infrastructure and expertise have not yet been reached; Provides quick response to standardization requirements there
 yah upyogita vishwavyaapee takneekee atyaavashyaktaa ko bharan karti he
 Modulation is the process of distinguishing one waveform from another waveform
 doorsanchaar main adhimishran kaa istemaal sandesh bhejne ke liye hota he, lekin ek sangeetkaar swar-saamanjasy ke liye kisi vaadyayantra ke swar kii maatra, uskaa samay yaa timming or swaraghaat ko alag karne main iskaa upyog karata he
 Often high frequency sinusoid waveforms are used as carrier signals for low-frequency signals
 sin wave ke teen pramukh maapdand hai - uskaa apana aayam, uske charan or uski aavriti, ek modulated singnal praapt karne ke liye in sabhi sanchaar sanket ko kam frequency ke aadhaar par sanshodhit kiya ja saktaa he
 The device which performs modulation is called modulator and the device which performs the opposite action is called demodulator
 jo upkaran donon hi tarah kaa kaary kar saktaa he vah modem kehalaata he 
 The purpose of digital modulation is to transfer digital bit streams to an analog passband channel, for example; Public switched telephone networks, or transfers over a limited radio frequency band
 anuroop adhimishran kaa uddeshy ek anuroop besaband sanket ko hastantarit karnaa he, udhaaharan ke liye ek audio sanket yaa tivi sanket ko ek anuroop pasband channel par hastantarit karnaa he, doosraa udhaaharan radio frequency band yaa cabel tivi network channel ko simit karnaa bhi he
 Analog and numerical modulation simplifies frequency division multiplexing, while simultaneously transferring multiple low-pass information signals via separate passband channels via a shared physical medium
 ankiy besaband adhimishran pranali, jo ki line koding kehalaata he, kaa uddeshy bhi ek ankiy bit stream par besaband channel ko, ek serial bas yaa taar dwaara jude local aria network jaise non filter-tambe ke taar ke jariye hastanantarit karnaa he
 The purpose of a pulse modulation system is to transfer a narrowband analog signal, for example a call call coming to a wideband baseband channel, or in some schemes the beat stream to another digital transmission system
 anuroop adhimishran main, anuroop information sanket par adhimishran lagaataar chalata rahata he
 Common analog modulation techniques are as follows: ankiy adhimishran main, anuroop vaahak sanket ek ankiy bit pravaah ke jariye adhimishrit hota he
 The digital modulation method can have digital-to-analog conversion and demodulation or detection can be analog-to-digital conversion
 vaahak sanket main parivartan m vikalp pratikon ke ek parimit sankhya se chune jate hai
 a common example: a telephone line is designed to transfer audible sound, for example take a tone, it is not numeric bits
 computer isiilie telephone main modem ke jariye sampark sthapit kar saktaa he, jo ankiy bits kaa pratinidhitiv tone, jise pratik kehete hai, ke dwaara karata hai
 If there are four choice symbols, the first symbol can represent bit sequence 00, similarly the second one on 01, the third 10 and the fourth 11
 If a modem plays music with 1000 tones per second, its symbol rate is 1000 symbols
 / Per second, or baud
 Since each tone in this example represents a message with two numeric bits, the bit rate is twice the symbol rate i
e
 2000 bits per second
 ankiy sanket kii ek paribhaasha ke anusaar, adhimishrit sanket ek ankiy sanket he, lekin ek anya paribhaasha main adhimishran ko ankiy se anuroop ke roopantaran bhi kaha gaya he
 In most textbooks, the digital modulation scheme is synonymous with data transmission as digital transmission, in very few textbooks it is called analog transmission
 atyaadhik moulik ankiy adhimishran takanic is prakaar hai: In QAM, an infinite signal and a quadrature phase amplitude are expressed in a finite number
 ise ek tu-channel pranali ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, harek channel ASK kaa upyog karata he
 The resulting signal is equivalent to a combination of both PSK and ASK
 uparokt sabhi paddati main harek charan, aavruti yaa aayam ek adbhut dohare beats ke pattern dwaara tay hote hai
 Typically, each phase encodes the same number of beats of frequency or amplitude
 is bits kii sankhya main shaamil pratik kaa pratinidhitiv vishesh charan dwaara hota he
 If the alphabet includes m = 2 n { \ displaystyle m = 2 ^ {N}} as an optional symbol, each symbol represents a message of n bits
 yadi pratik dar f s { \ displaystyle f_{s}} pratik prati second he, data dar n f s { \ displaystyle nf_{s}} beats prati second he
 For example, an alphabet that has 16 optional symbols, each symbol represents 4 bits
 isliye data dar bod dar se chaar guna hoga
 In PSK, ASK or QAM, where the carrier frequency of the modulated signal is constant, the modulation alphabet often simply represents the zodiac, the i signal of the amplitude for each signal representing the x-axis and the q signal by the y-axis
 QAM ke siddhant kaa upyog kar PSK or ASK, lekin kabhi-kabhi FSK bhi aksar paidaa kiya or pataa lagaaya jaataa he
 The i and q signal can be combined into the complex-value signal i + jq
 natijatan samatuly lo-paas sanket yaa samatuly besband sanket ke naam se janaa jane vaala vaastavik maan adhimishrit sanket physical sanket jatil maan kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 The following are the common steps useful for transmitting data by a modulator: resiver kii ore se aamtaur par di-modulator nimna kaary karata he: It is common in all digital communication systems that both the modulator and the de-modulator must be designed simultaneously
 Numerical modulation schemes are possible because both the sender-recipient parties must know in advance how to encrypt the data and how to represent the communication system
 In all digital communication systems, both the modifier of the sender and the de-modulator of the receiver are designed in such a way that they can work with each other in addition to their work
 asangat adhimishran paddati main ek praapak ko sandarbh kaald sanket jo ki preshak vaahak wave ke saath ek hi charan main ghatit hota he, kii jarurat nahin hoti
 aise maamle main adhimishran sanket main atulykaalik rup se sthanantarit hota hai
 The opposite is favorable modulation
 sabase zyada aam ankiy adhimishran takanic is prakaar hai: MSK and GMSK are special cases of continuous phase modulation
 darasal, CPM ke upakutumb kaa MSK vishesh maamla he, jo ki continus phej frequency-shift keeing ek sankethik-samay kii avadhi ke taur par bhi janaa jaataa he, jo ki ek ytaakar aavruti pulse he
 OFDM is based on frequency division multiplexing, but is used as a numerical modulation scheme
 bit stream kai samanaantar data strimon main vibhajit ho jaataa he or harek stream paaramparik ankiy adhimishran yojana kaa upyog kar apane sab-carrier main sthanantarit ho jaataa he
 The OFDM signal is an abbreviated form of a modulated subcarrier
 OFDM ek bahuvidhi takanic ke bajaay ek adhimishran takanic ke rup main mana jaataa he, kyonki yah kisi bit stream ko tathakthith OFDM ke ek anukram kaa upyag karke sanchaar channel main hastantarit kar detaa he
 OFDM can be expanded from channel access method to orthogonal frequency division multiple access and MC-CDMA scheme to multi-user channel, so that multiple users can use the same medium by giving code to different subcarriers or multiple users
 Allow to do
 do prakaar ke RF power vistaarak, swichan vistaarak kam keemat vaala he or ek hi output pavaar vaale liner vistaarak kii tulana main kam bydaree pavaar kaa upyog karata he
 However, they only work with relatively stable amplitude modulation signals such as angular modulation and CDMA, but not with QAM and OFDM
 Although the switching amplifier is also completely unsuitable for a common QAM group, the QAM modulation principle is often used to allow switching amplifiers to run with these fms and other waveforms, and sometimes QAM de-modulation uses these switching
 This is done to get the signal by the expanders
 ankiy besaband adhimishran shabd pankti kuta yaa sanket kaa paryaay he
 It is a method of transferring a digital beat stream to the analog baseband, using a pulse train, which is a discrete numbered signal level, directly through modulating the voltage and current in the cable
 ekadhruviya, non-ritern-tu-jiro, manchester or alternet mark invarsan kutalekhan vagairah iske saamaanya udhaaharan hai
 The purpose of pulse modulation scheme is to transfer a narrowband analog signal to the pulse wave via modulation as a two-level signal in the analog baseband
 kuch pulse adhimishran yojana nairoband anuroop sanket ko ek ankiy sanket ek sthai bit rate; jo ki anternihit ankiy preshak paddati he, ke rup main sthanantarit ho saktaa he, udhaaharan ke liye kuch pankti kuta, ko sthanantaran kii anumati pradaan karata he
 In the formal sense, they do not fall under the modulation scheme, as they are not channel coding schemes, but should be treated as source encoding schemes and in some cases as analog-to-digital conversion techniques

com / ?p=15650 sooryakanth treepathi 'niraala' hindi kavita ke chhayavaadi yug ke chaar pramukh stambhon main se ek maane jate hai
 He along with Jaishankar Prasad, Sumitranandan Pant and Mahadevi Verma are considered to be the main pillars of cinematography in Hindi literature
 unhone kahaniyaan, upanyaas or niabandh bhi likhe hai kintu unki khyaati visheshrup se kavita ke kaaran hi he
 Suryakant Tripathi 'nirala' was born on the Magh Shukla 11, Samvat 1955, 21 February 1899 accordingly, in the Mahishadal princely state of Bengal
 vasant panchami par unka janmdin manaane kii parampara 1930 main prarambh hui
 He was born on Tuesday
 janm-kundalee banane vaale pandit ke kehane se unka naam surjakumaar rakhaa gaya
 His father Pandit Ramshay Tiwari was a resident of Unnao and worked as a soldier in Mahishadal
 ve mul rup se uttar pradesh ke unnav jile ke gadhacola naamak gaanv ke nivasee the
 Nirala was educated up to high school
 baad main hindi sanskrit or bangla kaa swatantra adhyayan kiya
 In the beginning, Nirala got acquainted with the inconveniences and humiliation of his father's small job
 unhone dalit-shoshit kisaan ke saath hamadardi kaa sanskaar apane abodh man se hi arjeet kiya
 The mother died at the age of three and by the age of twenty, the father died
 apane bacchon ke alaava sanyukt parivaar kaa bhi boj niraala par padaa
 In the epidemic that spread after the first World War, not only wife Manohara Devi, but also uncle, brother and sister-in-law died
 shesh kunbe kaa boj uthaane main mahishadal kii naukari aparyaapt thi
 All his life after this was spent in financial struggle
 niraala ke jivan kii sabase vishesh baat yah he ki kathin se kathin paristhitiyon main bhi unhone siddhant tyagkar samjhaute kaa rasta nahin apanaaya, sangharsh kaa saahas nahin ganvaaya
 The latter part of life was spent in Allahabad
 vahiin daraganj muhalle main sthit raysahab kii vishaal kothi ke thik peeche bane ek kamare main 15 oktober 1961 ko unhone apni igalila samaapt kii
 The first appointment of Suryakant Tripathi 'nirala' took place in the Mahishadal state itself
 unhone 1918 se 1922 tak yah naukari kii
 He then moved to editing, independent writing and translation work
 1922 se 1923 ke dauraan kolkata se prakashit 'samanvay' kaa sampadan kiya, 1923 ke agast se matvaala ke sampadak mandal main kaary kiya
 He was then appointed to the Ganga Book Mala office in Lucknow, where he remained associated with the institution's monthly magazine Sudha till mid-1935
 1935 se 1940 tak kaa kuch samay unhone lakhanu main bhi bitaayaa
 After this, he lived in Allahabad till 1942 and did independent writing and translation work
 unki pehali kavita janmabhumi prabhaa naamak masik patr main june 1920 main, pehla kavita sangrah 1923 main anamika naam se, tathaa pehla niabandh bang bhashaa kaa uccharan oktober 1920 main masik patrika saraswati main prakashit hua
 Unlike other poets of his contemporary, he has taken little recourse to imagination in poetry and has portrayed reality prominently
 ve hindi main muktchand ke pravartak bhi maane jate hai
 In the role of his poetry collection Parimal published in 1930, he writes - niraala ne 1920 i0 ke aasapaas se lekhan kaary aarambh kiya
 His first composition was a song written on 'janmabhoomi'
 lambey samay tak niraala kii pratham rachana ke rup main prasiddh 'juhi kii kali' sheershak kavita, jiskaa rachanakaal niraala ne swayan 1916 i0 batalaaya tha, vastutah 1921 i0 ke aasapaas likhi gayi thi tathaa 1922 i0 main pehali baar prakashit hui thi
 Apart from poetry, Nirala has written in a tremendous amount in other genres of narrative and prose
 niraala rachanawali naam se 8 khandon main purv prakashit evam aprakashit sampoorn rachanaaon kaa suniyojit prakaashan The greatest feature of Suryakant Tripathi 'nirala' poetry is the skill of illustration
 aantarik bhav ho yaa bahya jagat ke drishy-rup, sangitatmak dhvaniyaan ho yaa rang or gandh, sajiv charitra hon yaa prakritik drishy, sabhi alag-alag laganevaale tattvon ko ghulaa-milakar niraala aisa jeevant chitra upasthit karte hai ki padhane vaala un chitron ke madhyam se hi niraala ke marm tak pahunch saktaa he
 Nirala's paintings not only contain her emotion, but also her thinking
 isliye unki bahut-si kavitaaon main darshanik gaharaai utpann ho jaati he
 Due to this new illustration skill and philosophical depth, often Nirala's poems become somewhat complicated, which the thinkers accuse them of rigor etc
 as they do not understand
 unke kisaan-bodh ne hi unhen chhayavaad kii bhoomi se aage badhkar yatharthwaad kii nai bhoomi nirmit karne kii prerana di
 Seeing special situations, characters and scenes, recognizing their heart and making those specific objects the subject of illustration is a notable feature of Nirala's realism
 niraala par aadhyatmavaad or rahasyavaad jaisi jivan-vimukh pravritiyon kaa bhi asar he
 Due to this effect, they often dream of conquering miracles and ending conflicts
 niraala kii shakti yah he ki ve chamatkaar ke bharose akarmanya nahin baith jate or sangharsh kii vaastavik chunauti se ankhen nahin churaate
 In some cases, mysticism goes against the unique real life experiences
 har ore prakaash failaa he, jivan alokamay mahaasaagar main dub gaya he, ityadi aisi hi baaten hai
 But this mysticism is not permanent in the sense of the infrequent, it proves to be fleeting
 anek baar niraala shabdon, dhvaniyon aadi ko lekar khilwaad karte hai
 It is difficult to call these players art
 lekin saamanyat: ve in khilvaadon ke madhyam se bade chamatkaarpurn kalatmak prayog karte hai
 The specialty of these experiments is that they are helpful in expressing the subject or emotion more effectively
 niraala ke prayogon main ek vishesh prakaar ke saahas or sajagata ke darshan hote hai
 It is this courage and awareness that makes Nirala different and special among poets of his era
 lebar party britain kii ek centre - left yani raajnneetik party he
 It was born in the nineteenth century with the movement of trade unions and the rise of socialist political parties, defined as liberal churches

 antarrashtriya sambandh vibhinn deshon ke bich sambandhon kaa adhyayan he, saath hi saath samprabhu rajyon, antar-sarkari sanghathanon, antarrashtriya gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon, gaiyr-sarkari sanghathanon or bahurashtriya companiyon kii bhoomika kaa bhi adhyayan he
 International relations is also sometimes referred to as 'international study'), although the two terms are not entirely synonymous
 saadhaaran shabdon main 'antarrashtriya raajnneeti' kaa arth he 'rajyon ke madhya raajnneeti karnaa'
 If we study the meaning of 'politics' three major elements emerge - the existence of groups; Consent between groups; And fulfill their interests by groups
 is aashay ko yadi antarrashtriya str par akalan karen to ye teen tatv mukhya rup se - rajyon kaa astitv; rajyon ke bich sangharsh; tathaa apane rashtrahiton kii purti hetu shakti kaa prayog
 Therefore, international politics is to study the actions under which states struggle on the basis of power to fulfill their national interests
 is sandarbh main rashtriya hit antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke pramukh lakshya hote hai; sangharsh iskaa disha nirdesh tay karti he; tathaa shakti is uddeshy prapti kaa pramukh saadhan mana jaataa he
 But we can consider the above definition as traditional, because today 'international politics' has been replaced by the broader concept 'international relations'
 iske antargat rajyon ke paraspar sangharsh ke saath-saath sahyogaatmak pahaluon ko bhi ab antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke antargat adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Apart from this, apart from 'states', many other factors have now become the subject area of international politics
 atah iske antargat aaj vyakti, sanstha, sanghathan va kai anya gaiyr-rajya ikaiyaan bhi sammilit ho gai hai
 Its present base and subject area has taken a very wide form today
 in sabhi vishyon par charchaa se pehle alag-alag vidwaanon dwaara di gai nimna paribhaashaon kii samiksha karnaa ati anivaary ho jaataa he- The scope of these definitions is very limited, because basically 'states' have been considered as factors of international politics
 yah antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke swaroop tak hi simit he
 Mainly hannes j
 Margenthau, Harald Sprout, Bon Dyk, Thompson, etc
 are its main supporters, which is clear from their definitions- naveen paribhaashaon main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vyapak swaroop antarrashtriya sambandhon kii charchaa kii gai he
 In addition to the state, new factors of international politics such as international organizations, longitude groups, ngos, international institutions, some individuals etc
 have also been included
 iske atirikt isamen sangharsh ke saath-saath sahyog tathaa raajnneeti ke saath-saath pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup main ise prabhavit karne vaale arthath, saanskrithik, dharmik, saamaajik, vigyaan evam takniki aadi pahaluon kaa bhi ullekh kiya gaya he
 The following definitions of various authors reveal this meaning very clearly
 is prakaar antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa swaroop prarambh se vartmaan tak bahut vyapak ho jaataa he
 It has included the study of various world units and organizations along with nation states today
 parantu in sabhi parivartanon ke baad bhi in adhyayanon kaa kendra bindu aaj bhi raashtra rajya hi he
 Based on the above definitions, the following conclusions about the nature of international politics emerge
 atah antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa swaroop parivartansheel he
 Whenever the environment, factors and developments of international politics will change, changes in methods and approaches to study it are also inevitable
 iske atirikt, yah parivartan sthai na hokar nirantar he
 Along with this, it is very complex due to various factors, levels, dimensions, etc
 Therefore, a smooth, rational, comprehensive approach is required for its smooth study
 jaisaa uparyukt paribhaashaon evam swaroop se gyaat he ki antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa vishay kshetra badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Today its subject area has become quite extensive, under which the following things are studied: atah antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa vishay kshetra aaj bahut vyapak va jatil hone ke saath-saath vikaas kii ore agrasar he
 Under this, the study of various traditional factors as well as non-traditional factors is also becoming important
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vikaas kaa itihaas zyada pracheen nahin he, balki yah vishay beesvin shatabdi kii upaj he
 Clearly, its history begins with the establishment of the international Woodrow Wilson Chair in Welles University in 1919
 is peeth par pratham asin hone vaale prasiddh itihaaskaar professor aloard jimrn the tathaa baad main anya pramukh viddhan jinhone is peeth ko sushobhit kiya unamem se pramukh the - si

 At the same time similar arrangements were seen in other universities and institutes
 atah pichhali ek shatabdi ke is vishay ke itihaas par drushtipaat karen to is vishay main aaye utaar-chadhaav ke saath-saath iske ek swytt vishay main sthapit hone ke bare main jaankaree milti he
 Multidimensional changes in this subject have helped to enhance, coordinate and develop the content on the one hand, and on the other hand by rendering various theories, it has helped in understanding many complex problems and aspects
 kenneth thampsan ne san 1962 ke 'rivyuu of politics' main prakashit apane lekh main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke itihaas ko chaar bhaagon main baanta he, jiske aadhaar par is vishay kaa suspasht evam sunishchit adhyayan sambhav ho saktaa he
 These four stages of development can also include the fifth phase of the post-cold War era
 inkaa vistrut varnan nimna prakaar se he- Before the First World War, only scholars of history, law, political science, philosophy etc
 considered different aspects of international politics
 mukhya rup se itihaaskaar hi iskaa adhyayan rajanyik itihaas tathaa anya deshon ke saath sambandhon ke itihaas ke rup main karte the
 Under this, there was an account of the work done by diplomats and foreign ministers
 atah ise kootnithik itihaas kii sangya bhi di jaati he
 According to EH Kar, before World War I, the relation of war was understood only to the soldiers and its equivalent international politics was related to diplomats
 iske atirikt, prajatantric deshon main bhi paramparaagat rup se videsh niti ko dalgat raajnneeti se alag rakhaa jaataa tha tathaa chune hue ang bhi apane aapako videshi mantralay par ankush rakhane main asamarth mahasoos karte the
 Prior to 1919, there were several major reasons for apathy towards the subject - First, till this time it was believed that war and alliance among states were as natural as poverty and unemployment
 atah yuddh, videsh niti evam rajyon ke madhya paraspar sambandhon ko roak paanaa maanviya samarthy ke vash se baahar mana jaataa tha
 Second, before World War I, wars were not so fierce
 tritiy, sanchaar sadhano ke abhaav main antarrashtriya raajnneeti kuch gine chune rajyon tak hi simit thi
 Thus the biggest shortcoming of the study of international politics in this era was the development of general interests
 is kaal main keval rajanyik itihaas kaa varnanaatmak adhyayan maatra hi hua
 As a result, it helped to understand neither the current nor future international politics
 is yug kii maatra uplabdhi 1919 main wales vishvavidhyalay main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan ke peeth kii sthapana rahi
 In the period between the two world wars, two parallel currents developed
 jinamein se pratham ke antargat purv aitihaasikta ke prati prabhutv ko chhodkar samayik ghatnaon / samasyao ke adhyayan par adhik bal diya jane laga
 Along with this, an attempt has also been made to combine historical political studies with the current political contexts
 aitihaasik prabhaav ke kam hone ke baad bhi antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan hetu ek samgr drushtikon kaa abhaav abhi bhi bana rahaa
 During this period, a lot of emphasis was placed on the study of the present, but the importance of the mutual relationship between the present and the past is still not recognized
 iske atirikt, na hi yudhottar raajnneetik samasyaon ko ateet kii tulaneey samasyaon ke saath rakhkar dekhne kaa prayaas hi kiya gaya
 Perhaps this is why even in this era two fundamental deficiencies were clearly revealed
 pratham, pehle charan kii hi bhaanti is kaal main bhi antarrashtriya raajnneeti main saarvbhaumik siddhanth kaa vikaas nahin ho sakaa
 Second, even today the study of international politics could not become more explicit and rational
 is prakaar is charan main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan main bal dene kii sthiti main badlaav ke atirikt bahut zyada parivartan dekhne ko nahin mila tathaa na hi is vishay ke spasht rup se swatantra anushaasan banane kii pushti hui
 The third phase of the development of international politics was also a period between two world wars parallel to the second phase
 ise sudhaarwad kaa yug isliye kaha jaataa he ki isamen rajyon dwaara raashtra sangh kii sthapana ke kadhyam se antarrashtriya raajnneeti main sudhaar kii kalpana kii gai
 In this era, there was mainly institutional development
 is kaal ke vidwaanon, rajanyikon, rajanetaaon va chintakon kaa maananaa tha ki yadi antarrashtriya sansthaaon kaa vikaas ho jaataa he to vishwa samudaay ke sammukh upasthit yuddh va shanti kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan sambhav ho sakegaa
 For this purpose some legal and ethical approaches were structured which had the following main grounds
 inhen aadarshik evam naitik mulyon par bal dete hue antarrashtriya sanghathan kii pariklpana kii gai
 After its establishment, it was believed that the struggle to make peace between the states in international relations is over
 nai vyavastha ke antargat shakti santulan kaa koi sthaan nahin hoga
 Now the states will settle their disputes through the Union
 atah is yug main na keval yuddh va shaanti kii samasyaon kaa vivechan kiya, apitu iske doorgaami sudhaaron ke bare main bhi sochaa gaya
 Hence, the main points of the study were also to change the nature of international politics through legal problems and development of organizations
 antatah is kaal main bhavatmak, kalpanasheel va naitik sudhaarwad par adhik bal diya gaya he
 But there was always a question mark on the significance of these approaches between the World Wars
 raashtra sangh kii pratham ek dashak kii gatividhiyon se jahaan aashaa kii kiran dikhaai di, vahiin duusare dashak kii yarthathwaadee sthiti ne is dharna ko bilkul samaapt kar diya
 Non-cooperation and factionalism among the big powers gave rise to a power struggle system instead of establishing peace
 japan ne manchuriya par hamale karke jahaan shanti ko bhang kar diya vahiin italy, germany va rus ne bhi vivaadaaspad sthitiyon main na keval raashtra sangh kii sadsyta hi chodi, balki dwitiya vishwayuddh ke prarambh hone kii prakriya ko or teevr bana diya
 In this way, the world system could not run with peace, morality and law, then the realist approach was strengthened as an alternative approach due to writers like EH Kar, Shumbha, Quincy Right
 is charan main antarrashtriya raajnneeti main moolbhoot parivartanon se na keval isaki vishaywastu vyapak hui balki isamen bahut jatiltaayen bhi paidaa ho gai
 Changes in the nature of politics and the rise of new states during the Cold War era changed the entire international environment
 parinamswaroop naye upagamon, ayaamon, sansthaaon va pravritiyon kaa sarjan hua jinke madhyam se antarrashtriya sambandhon kaa adhyayan sunishchit ho gaya
 The failures of the ideal, institutional, ethical, legal and reformist streams of the earlier stages led to the development of new approaches
 yah nayaa upagam tha-yatharthwaad
 Although EH Karr, Schwarzenberger, Quincy Right, Shubhan etc
 developed this approach, but Hanes J
 Margenthau presented it as a general principle
 is siddhanth ke anusaar rajya hameshaa apane hiton kii purti hetu sangharshrat rahete hai
 Therefore, to understand international politics, it is very important to understand the various aspects of this power struggle
 yathartwaadee drushtikon ke saath antarrashtriya sansthaaon ke sunishchit va suspasht vikaas ke rup main antarrashtriya sanghathan kii bhi utpatti hui
 Now the form of this organization emerged as an important political organization rather than an idealistic and reformist
 iske antargat maanavjaati ko yuddh kii vibheeshikaa se bachaane ke saath-saath rajyon ke madhya sangharsh ke koun-koun se kaaran hai? vishvashanti hetu khatre ke koun-koun se kaarak hai? shanti kii sthapana kaise ho sakati he? shastron kii hode ko kaise roka ja saktaa he? aadi kai prakaar ke prashnon kaa samaadhaan dhundne ke prayaas bhi kiye gaye
 Along with the above two trends, the origin of behaviorism was also an important achievement of this era
 vyavahaaravaadi drushtikon ke madhyam se ”vyavastha siddhanth“ kii utpatti kar antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Under this approach, it is considered necessary to study three major factors for the study of states
 ye kaarak the- The main force of the above trends has been to promote the ideology of international politics
 atah is yug main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke saarvbhaumik siddhanton kaa pratipaadan karnaa ati mahatvapurn kaary rahaa he
 As a result of this process of theory formation, many partial theories like - realism, theory of balance, communication theory, sports theory, bargaining theory, peace research approach, system theory, world order model etc
 were created
 in siddhanton ke pratipaadan ke baavjood is yug main kisi ek saarvbhaumik va saamaanya siddhanth kaa abhaav abhi bhi bana rahaa
 In the 1990s, Jayant Bandhopadhyay, in his book - General Theory of International Relations - has tried to overcome the shortcomings of Martin Kaplan's administrative theory, but he is still in a period of debate
 atah saiddhantikaran ke mukhya daur ke baavjood shityudh kaaleen yug apni vaicharik sankeernata va algaav ke kaaran kisi ek saamaanya siddhanth ke pratipaadan se vanchit rahaa
 In the post-cold War era, all nations started joining together under one economic system
 isiilie ab vaishvikaran, udaarikaran, mukt bazaar vyavastha aadi kaa daur prarambh ho gaya
 In this context, not only the importance of economic issues increased, but the importance of international politics also increased
 aaj rashtriyata evam antarrashtriyata kaa vibhed samaapt ho gaya iske atirikt, ab antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii vishay suchi main kaaphi naveen vishyon kaa samavesh ho gaya jo rashtriya na rahakar ab maanavjaati kii samasyaon ke rup main ubhar kar aaye
 Among the major problems of the current world, terrorism, environment, depletion of ozone layer, trafficking of drugs and drugs, human rights abuses etc
, major issues have emerged which have become mandatory to solve at international level rather than at national level or regional level
 
 saiddhanthik str par bhi 1945 se 1991 tak ke saarvbhaumik siddhanth kii sthapana ke prayaas ko dhakka laga
 Priorities in this context of international politics have now changed
 uttar-aadhuniktawaad main ab saarvbhaumik siddhanton kii sarthakata par prashn chihn lag rahe hai
 The influence of historical context and ancient environment is also being denied
 ab swatantra mudde adhik mahatvapurn ho gaye hai
 Great principles have become secondary
 nae sandarbh main aanshik shodh adhik mahatvapurn ban gai he
 For example, with more emphasis on the topics of feminism, human rights, environment etc
, thinking has also started
 atah shityudhottar yug main antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa swaroop, vishay suchi evam vishay kshetra purna rup se parivartit ho gaye hai
 Now too much emphasis is not being laid on the general theoretical establishment
 isiilie is badale hue parivesh main antarrashtriya raajnneeti mahatvapurn hi nahin, apitu swaittata kii ore agrasar prathit ho rahi he
 And there are optimistic signs for the subject's autonomy
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ne na keval antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko moolbhoot rup main prabhavit kiya apitu kai mahatvapurn muddon kii abhivyakti bhi kii
 Changes in the factors of international politics, broadening of factors, rendering of new principles etc
 Apart from many topics, the entire environment of international politics has changed itself
 jahaan ek ore saiddhanthik str par yatharthwaad va adarshavaad ke vaad-vivaad tathaa pracheen va vaigyaniktaa par vaad-vivaad ho rahaa he, vahiin duusari ore vyavhaarik str par antarrashtriya sambandh vishay ke praaroop ke bare main vivaadaaspad prashn uth rahe the ki - kya antarrashtriya sambandh ek swytt vishay he yaa nahin? yadhyapi aaj adhiktar vishvavidhyalayon main snaatak va snatakottar staron par tathaa shodh hetu yah ek swytt vishay ke rup main padhaayaa ja rahaa he, tathaapi ise saamaajik vigyaan ke anya vishyon ke samakaksh manyata nahin mili he
 It has so much happened that in developed countries, it is being taught as a completely autonomous subject in many universities
 bharat jaise vikasshil deshon main bhi sudhaar hua he
 Initially here 'indian School of International Relations, New Delhi' which later on autonomously functions as the School of International Relations at Jawaharlal Nehru University
 iske atirikt kai anya vishvavidhyalayon jaise jadavapur vishvavidhyalay, kalakatta, goa vishvavidhyalay aadi main bhi ab ise swytt vishay kaa darja mila he
 Before studying international relations as an autonomous subject, it is necessary to clarify one thing that when we study the question of autonomy of this subject, 'international politics' and international relations are not considered as separate subjects
 yah isliye kiya gaya he ki donon hi vishyon ko abhi swytt anushaasan na maanakar raajnneetishastra vishay ke ek up-anushaasan ke rup main hi manyata praapt he
 Secondly, the distinction is so subtle that this subject can be resolved after authenticating the autonomy of the discipline
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko swytt vishay maanane ke sandarbh main teen pruthak-pruthak vichaar die gaye hai jo nimna prakaar se hai - According to scholars who consider this subject as autonomous, it should be considered as an autonomous subject given the content and discipline related content of international politics
 is tark ke pramukh samarthak hai- si
e
dablyoo
 maining, quinci rhit, rabart loting alen, hence je

 These scholars have certified it as an autonomous subject on the following grounds: jo vidwaan antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko ek swytt vishay nahin maanate unka maananaa yah he ki is vishay main aisi koi vilakshan vastu nahin he ki ise adhyayan hetu swytt mana jaae
 He has supported his point on the basis of the following arguments- kuch vidwaan uparyukt donon prakaar kii bahes ko nirarthak maanate hai
 They believe that both of the above arguments can be better understood through the development in international politics
 atah 20veen shatabdi main, or visheshkar 1945 ke baad, ke vikaas kii samiksha ati anivaary he
 If we study deeply the question of autonomy of international politics, then it is known that two fundamental problems have to be faced in this context
 ek to antarrashtriya sambandh ke swaroop, vishaywastu va adhyayan ke tareekon main prabhavi parivartan aaye hai
 Second, at the same time, the problem has increased further due to the complexities of political science and the development of undefined boundaries
 lekin 1919 se aaj tak ke antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vikaas par nazar daalen to spasht hota he ki isaki uplabdhiyaan ise swaittata dilaane main kaaphi sahaayak siddh hongi
 Since 1919, especially in America, many scholars have tried to make this subject more and more scientific
 iske vishay vastu, tareekon evam siddhanth ko suspasht karne ke prayaas bhi hue hai
 These authors mainly include Paul, Rines, Bern, James Bright, Hubert, Givens, Raymond Wull, Parker, Moon, Shubhan, Alford Jimene, E

 The contribution of cars etc
 has been commendable
 is sandarbh main samiksha ke pashchaat richard smithbil is nishkarsh par pahunche hai ki- This situation has undergone significant changes after the Second World War
 is kshetra main hue naye shodhon ke aadhaar par jahaan ek ore antarrashtriya sambandhon ke vishleshnatmak sambandhon ko bal mila he, vahiin duusari ore naveen siddhanton kaa pratipaadan bhi hua he
 Several scholars in America, mainly Maranthau, Richard Snyder, Martin Kaplan, Carl W
 Doyce, Charles mcclelland, have made specific contributions in this regard
 iske atirikt viksit va vikasshil donon deshon ke adhyayan par bal diya he
 The compilation of its subject matter, theory rendering and methods have also developed a lot
 parantu aaj bhi sabase mahatvapurn kami ek saarvbhaumik / saamaanya siddhanth pratipaadan kaa abhaav bana hua he
 Its importance in the post-cold War world has increased
 is bhoomandaleekaran ke daur main sabhi rajya ek prakaar kii aarthik vyavastha se judate ja rahe hai
 International and national issues like environment, terrorism, feminism, ADS, depletion of ozone layer, human rights etc
 have become associated with human / human beings rather than national
 atah aaj in sabake samaadhaan hetu antarrashtriya manchon / sanghathanon kii sakriy bhagidaari aavashyak he
 Now universal theory has also been rejected from the point of view of postmodernism and more emphasis has been given on subjective and local basis
 at 1945 ke baad ke vikaas ke aadhaar par ise swaittata kii ore agrasar kaha ja saktaa he, jise 1991 ke baad sheet yuddh ke ant kii prakriya ne or shashakt banane kii koshish kii he

 If a scholar is of the opinion that the word Kannada is derived from "kaniruduanadu" meaning "black clay country", then according to other scholars, "kannadu" from "kapitu Nadu" means "fragrant country" and "kannadu" from "kannadu"
 Derivation has taken place

 Some grammars state that Kannada is a form of the Sanskrit word "karnat"
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki "karnayo atati iti karnataka" arthath jo kaanon main goonjataa he vah karnataka he
 In ancient texts, the words Kannada, Karnat, Karnataka have been used in synonyms

 In the second century Tamil poem titled "shilappadikaram", the name of the Kannada speakers is "karunadar"

 praarambhik kannada kaa likhit rup shilalekhon main miltaa he
 Among these inscriptions, the inscription found from a place called Hulmidi is the oldest, which dates to 450 AD
 saatvin shatabdi main likhe gaye shilalekhon main badaami or shravan belgol ke shilaalekh mahatvapurn hai
 Often prose is used only in pre-eighth century inscriptions and later inscriptions have excellent specimens of poetry containing poems
 in shilalekhon kii bhashaa jahaan sugathit tathaa praudh he vahaan usapar sanskrit kaa gaharaa prabhaav dikhaai detaa he
 Thus even though there is evidence of prose-poetry in Kannada based on inscriptions dating back to the 8th century, the work of writing in Kannada progressed after the name of the first available Kannada text, "kaviraj Marg", and the language continued to develop
