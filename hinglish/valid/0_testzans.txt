 The null hypothesis is a concept that can be falsified using tests of observed data
 is tarah kaa pareekshan ek rikt pariklpana kii vidhivat rachana kar, data kaa sangrah kar, tathaa is baat kii gananaa karke ki data kitna sambhavit he, kaary karata he, tathaa is pareekshan hetu aisi kalpana kii jaati he ki rikt pariklpana sahi thi
 If the data seems too unlikely, the user concludes that the null hypothesis is false
 yadi data rikt pariklpana ke tahat yathochit prathit hota he to koi nishkarsh nahin nikaala jaataa he
 In this case, the null hypothesis may also be true, or it may still be false; Such data provide insufficient evidence to reach any conclusion
 rikt pariklpana aamtaur par, ek saamaanya yaa difolt sthiti prastut karti he, jaise ki do parimapon ke madhya koi rishta hi nahin he,athwa upachaar or niyantran ke madhya koi antar hi nahin he
 The term is originally coined by the English geneticist and statistician Ronald Fisher
 sankhyikeey pariklpana pareekshan ke kuch sanskarnon main rikt pariklpana kaa pareekshan ek vaikalpik avadharana ke nimitt kiya jaataa he
 This option may or may not be a logical negation of the null hypothesis
 vaikalpik pariklpana kaa upyog ronaald fisher ke sankhyikeey pariklpana pareekshan kaa bhaag nahin tha, haalanki vaikalpik avadharana aaj maanak ke rup main upyog kii jaati he
 For example, one might want to test the claim that a certain drug may reduce the chances of a heart attack
 koi is rikt pariklpana kaa chayan kar saktaa he "yah dawa dil kaa daura hone ke avasaron ko kam nahin karti he "
 Then the person should collect data by observing such people who are taking or not taking medicines under any controlled use
 yadi rikt pariklpana ke tahat data bahut asambhavy he to aap rikt pariklpana ko asweekaar kar sakate he or, yah nishkarsh nikaal sakate he ki uskaa nishedh sach he
 That is, you can conclude that the drug reduces the likelihood of a heart attack
 yahan "asambhavy data" kaa aashay us data se he jahaan un logon kaa pratishat jo dil kaa daura padane ke baad dawa le rahe he, aise logon ke pratishat kii tulana main kaaphi kam he jo dil kaa daura padane ke baad bhi dawa nahin le rahe hai
 You should take care while selecting the null hypothesis as the answer to different options may be different
 is tathy ko nimnlikhit:udhaaharan main pradarshit kiya gaya he: aapako yah tay karne ke liye kaha jaataa he ki agar sikaa sahi he 
 You bounce it 5 times and head every time
 kya aap yah nishkarsh nikaalte he ki yah ek nishpaksh sikaa nahin he? ek vaikalpik pariklpana yah he ki "yah sikaa head ke prati pakshpaati he"
 rikt pariklpana yah hogi "yah sikaa head ke prati pakshpaati nahin he", jiskaa matlab yah he ki kam se kam jitani baar head aayegaa utani baar tail aayegaa
 is rikt pariklpana ke tahat, data vastav main asambhavy he 
 You can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the coin was biased
 haalanki, aap iske bajaay vaikalpik pariklpana "sikaa pakshpaati he ", or rikt avadharana, " yah sikaa nishpaksh he " kaa chayan bhi kar sakate he
 Then the data is not so unlikely; The same data should occur at least 6% of the time, where 3% of the time you should get a head every time and 3% of the time you should get a tail
 to koi rikt pariklpana ko asweekaar nahin karegaa, at: phir koi nishkarsh nahin nikaala jaayegaa
 is maamle main, duusari rikt pariklpana sahi sabit hogi: aapako vastav main yah tay karne ko kaha gaya tha ki sikaa uchit he yaa nahin, yah nahin ki sikaa head ke prati pakshpaati he
 You will need more data to reach such a conclusion
 is duusare udhaaharan main pariklpana pareekshan ke ek khatre ke bare main bataaya gaya he: yadi koi data ke ek set kaa pareekshan badi sankhya main aisi rikt pariklpanaayo ke saath karata he jo sabhi sahi hai, phir bhi vah unamem se kuch ko asweekaar kar saktaa he, jiske kaaran galat nishkarsh nikalataa he
 However, if a scientist follows the method and constructs a null hypothesis before collecting data, he commits only the first type of mistakes in small numbers
 beshak, agar dhyaan se or sahi dhang se bhi upyog kiya jaye tab bhi sankhyikeey pareekshan kuch galat nishkarsh detaa he
 In scientific and medical applications, the null hypothesis plays a major role in testing the importance of differences in treatment and control groups
 sarvavyaapak hote hue bhi is upyog bahut saare aadhaaron par aalochana hoti he At the beginning of the experiment the assumption is that there is no difference between the two groups: this is the null hypothesis in this example
 Other types of blank hypothesis are: udhaaharan ke liye, aap mahilaon or purushon ke madhya hue do yadrichhik namoona ke pareekshan ke praptankon se tulana kar sakate hai, tathaa yah puch sakate hai ki kya ek jansankhya-samooh kaa ausat prapthank anya samoohon se alag he
 a null hypothesis would be that the average score of the male population is the same as the average score of the female population: jahaan: Alternatively, the null hypothesis may provide the suggestion that both samples are drawn from the same population, thus the variance and distribution size will be equal, similarly the mean value will also be the same
 rikt pariklpana kaa nirupan sankhyikeey mahatv ke pareekshan main mahatvapurn charan he
 If the null hypothesis is correct, you can establish the possibility of observing the data obtained
 saamanytah sambhaavna ko saadharantaya parinaam ke "sarthakata str" naam diya jaataa he
 That is, in scientific experimental design, you can hypothesize that a particular factor will produce an effect on our dependent variable — this is the alternative hypothesis
 phir ham yah vichaar karenge ki ham apni prayogtmak parinaamon ko kitni baar dekhne kii ummid karte hai, yaa parinaam or bhi adhik charam ho sakate hai agar hamen ek aisi jansankhya se bahut saare namoonay lene pade jisamen koi prabhaav na ho 
 If we find that this rarely happens, we can conclude that our results support our experimental prediction — we reject our null hypothesis
 rikt pariklpana ke adhiktar kathan is prakaar pradarshit hote hai jaise uname "dishaatmakataa" naa ho, arthath aisa nishchit he ki maan samaan hai
 However, the null hypothesis can and does have "direction" —in these examples there are many examples in which statistical theory allows the testing process to be simplified, thus testing for an accurate identification
 Is equal to
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek paksheeya vaikalpik pariklpana taiyaar karte samay, aushadhi a kaa prayog rogiyon main vruddhi kar saktaa hai, to satya rikt pariklpana vaikalpik avadharana ke vipareet he arthath aushadhi a kaa prayog rogiyon main vruddhi nahin karegaa
 Effective null hypothesis will be the use of drug A, which will not have any effect for increase in patients
 yah samajhane ke liye ki kyon prabhavi rikt pariklpana hi maanya he, upar ullikhit avadharana kii prakruti par vichaar shikshaprad he
 It is imagined that patients using drug a will increase more than a control group who are not using the drug
 arthath, Where: prabhavi rikt pariklpana h 0 : μ d r u g = μ c o n t r o l { \ displaystyle H_{0}: \ mu _{drug}= \ mu _{control}} 
 True null hypothesis HT: μ drug ≤ μ control { \ displaystyle H_ {T}: \ mu _ {drug} \ leq \ mu _ {control}}
 newnikaran kaa kaaran yah he ki vaikalpik pariklpana hetu samarthan kaa anumaan lagane ke liye, shastreey pariklpana pareekshan hamen yah gananaa karne ke liye majaboor karata he ki kitni baar hamaari prayogtmak tippaniyon kii tulana main hamen charam parinaam praapt hue hai
 To do this, first we need to define the probability of rejection of each probability included in the null hypothesis and secondly to ensure that these probabilities are less than or equal to the critical level of the test
 kisi bhi uchit pareekshan prakriya hetu in sambhaavnaaon main sabase badi sambhaavna, vishesh rup se keval h 0 { \ displaystyle H_{0}} main sammilit maamlo ke liye kshetra kii seemaa h t { \ displaystyle H_{T}} par ghatit hogi
 Thus the test procedure can be defined to test the null hypothesis HT { \ displaystyle H_ {T}} in the same way as the null hypothesis of interest was the minimum version h 0 { \ displaystyle H_ {0}}
 dhyaan den ki kuch aise vyakti bhi he jo tark dete he ki rikt pariklpana utani saamaanya nahin he jitani kii upar bataai gayi he: jiseki fisher, jinhone sarvapratham " shunya pariklpana "shabdaawalee kaa nirmaan kiya, ne kaha he, "shunya avadharana ekadam sateek honi chahie, arthath yah aspashtataa or sandigdhta se mukt honi chahie kyonki ise 'vitaran kii samasya', kaa aadhaar pradaan karnaa chahie, mahatv kaa pareekshan jiskaa samaadhaan he
 "according to this view, the null hypothesis must be numerically accurate — it must be determined that a particular quantity or difference must equal a particular number
 shastreey vigyaan main, aam taur par yah kathan prasiddh he ki ek vishesh upachaar kaa koi prabhaav nahin he, avlokan main, aamtaur par yah he ki ek vishesh moolyankit char ke mulya or bhavishyavaanee ke bich koi antar nahin he
 One should inquire about the usefulness of this approach — one may note that in practice many blank hypothesis tests do not meet this criterion of being "accurate"
 For example, consider the general test that the two values are the same where true values of variances are not known - there is no mention of exact values of variances
 adhiktar sankhyikeevidon kaa maananaa he ki disha ko rikt pariklpana ke bhaag ke rup main yaa shunya avadharana / vaikalpik avadharana dway ke ek bhaag ke rup main nirdhaarit karnaa vaid he, 
 The logic is quite simple: if the direction is omitted, if the null hypothesis is rejected then the interpretation of the conclusion is completely misleading
 aisa maan len, rikt kaa arth he jansankhya ausat = 10 or van-taled vaikalpik: mean > 10
 agar x-baar ke madhyam se praapt semple avidence kaa maan -200 he or isi ke anukool tii-pareekshan aankada -50 ke baraabar he, to nishkarsh kya hoga? rikt pariklpana ko asweekaar karne ke liye kya paryaapt saboot nahin hai? nishchit rup se nahin! lekin ham is maamle main ek paksheeya vikalp sweekaar nahin kar sakate
 isliye, is sandigdhta ko dur karne ke liye, agar pareekshan ek tarafa he to prabhaav kii disha ko shaamil kar lenaa behatar he
 The statistical theory that is required for handling simple cases and more complex cases explained here uses an unbiased test hypothesis
 jab pariklpana pareekshan kiya jaataa he to bahut sari ikaayiyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 This process depends on the number of units involved in the study
 bhale hi ek rikt pariklpana jansankhya main koi myne nahin rakhti he, phir bhi ise asweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki namoona aakaar bahut chota he
 The statistical ability of a sample size test for a particular experiment or survey depends on the effect size required to be determined and the desired level of significance
 The statistically significant level of significance in statistical testing is the probability of rejection of the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is in the population
 Has been held yah kshamta rikt pariklpana ke asweekaar hone kii sambhaavna he jab rikt pariklpana ko jansankhya main dhaaran nahin kiya gaya ho 
 The decision regarding the size of the sample that will be used in the hypothesis testing process depends on these three measures
 namoona aakaar se sambandhit mudden adhyayan ke yojana charan main sanderbhit hone chahie

 In the year 1885, he returned home and started teaching in Presidency College as Assistant Professor of Physics
 yahaan vah 1915 tak rahe
 At that time, Indian teachers were paid one third of the salary of British teachers
 iskaa jagadish chandra bose ne virodh kiya or bina vetan ke teen varshon tak kaam karte rahe, jisaki vajah se unki stithi kharaab ho gai or un par kaaphi karja ho gaya tha
 To repay this debt, he also had to sell his ancestral land
 chauthe varsh jagadish chandra bose kii jeet hui or unhen puraa vetan diya gaya
 Bose was also a good teacher who used large scale scientific demonstrations to teach in the classroom

 British theoretical physicist James Clerk Maxwell predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves of mathematically diverse wavelengths, but he died in 1879 before his prediction was validated
 british bhautikavid oliver loj maxwell tarangon ke astitv kaa pradarshan 1887-88 main taron ke saath unhen preshit karke kiya
 German physicist Heinrich Hertz experimented with the existence of electromagnetic waves in free space in 1888
 iske baad, loj ne hertz kaa kaam jari rakhaa or june 1894 main ek smaraneey vyaakhyaan diya or use pustak ke rup main prakashit kiya
 Lodge's work attracted the attention of scientists from various countries, including Bose of India
 bose ke microwave anusandhan kaa pehali ullekhneey pahalu yah tha ki unhone tarang dairdhya ko millimetre str par laa diya 
 They understood the disadvantages of long wavelength light waves to study the properties of light
 1893 main, nicola testla ne pehle saarvajanik radio sanchaar kaa pradarshan kiya
 a year later, during a November 1894 public demonstration in Kolkata, Bose used a millimeter range microwave wave to fire ammunition and ring a bell
 leftinent governor sar wiliam maikenji ne kalakatta toun haul main bose kaa pradarshan dekha
 Bose wrote in a Bengali essay, 'invisible Light', "invisible light can easily pass through brick walls, buildings etc
, so the message can be transmitted through light without wires
 " rus main popov ne aisa hi ek prayog kiya
 Bose's first scientific article "on the polarization of electric rays by double refractory crystals" was sent to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in May 1895, within a year of the Lodge article
 unka doosraa lekh oktober 1895 main landan kii royal socity ko lard rele dwaara bheja gaya
 In December 1895, the London magazine electrician published Bose's article "on a new electro-polariscope"
 us samay angreji bolne vaali duniya main loj dwaara gadhe gaye shabd 'kohirar' k prayog hertz ke tarang resiver yaa detector ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 The electrician immediately commented on Bose's 'coherer'
 
 angreji patrika electrician se uddhrut tippanee he: Bose planned to better his "coherer" but never thought about the patent
 bose ne apane prayog us samay kiye the jab radio ek sampark madhyam ke taur par viksit ho rahaa tha
 Bose's work on radio microwave optics was not related to radio communication, but the improvements he made and the facts he wrote about it influenced other radio inventors
 us daur main 1894 ke ant main guglielmo marconi ek radio system par kaam kar rahe the jo wireles telegraphy ke liye vishith rup dizine kiya ja rahaa tha
 By early 1896, the system was transmitting radio signals far beyond the range indicated by physics
 jagadishchandra bose pehle vaigyanik the jinhone radio tarange detect karne ke liye semiconductor jankshan kaa istemaal kya tha or is paddati main kai microwave components kii khoj kii thi
 After this, there was no research on electromagnetic waves of millimeter length for the next 50 years
 1897 main bose ne landan ke royal institushan main apane millimetre tarango par kiye hue shodh kii varnana di thi
 He used waveguides, horn antennas, die -lectric lenses, different polarizers and semiconductors with frequencies up to 60 ghz - in his research

 He had said that Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose was 60 years ahead of his time
 asal main bose ne hi p - tip or n - tip semiconductor ke astitv kaa purvanumaan kiya tha
 His biggest contribution in the field of biophysics was that he showed that the stimulation of plants is transmitted through the electrical medium and not through the chemical medium
 baad main in daavon ko vaigyanik proyogo ke madhyam se sach sabit kiya gaya tha
 Acharya Bose first studied the effect of microwave on vegetative tissue
 unhone paudhon par badalte hue mausam se hone vaale asar kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 Along with this, he also studied the effect of chemical inhibitors on plants and the effect of plants on changing temperatures
 alag alag paristhitiyon main cell membrane potential ke badlaav kaa vishleshan karke ve is nattejey par pahunche kii paudhe samvedansheel hote hai ve " dard mahasoos kar sakate hai, sneh anubhav kar sakate hai ityadi "
 Bose did a comparative study of fat response on different metal and plant tissues
 unhone alag alag dhaatuo ko electrical, maikenical, rasinic or thermal tareekon ke mishran se uttejit kiya tha or koshikao or dhaatu kii pratikriya ke samaantaaon ko note kiya tha
 Bose's experiments showed a cyclic fatig reaction in simulated cells and metals
 iske saath hi jivit koshikao or dhaatuo main alag alag tarah ke uttejnaaon ke liye vishesh chakree fatig or recovery rispance kaa bhi adhyayan kiya tha
 Acharya Bose made a graph of the electrical response of changing plants with the changing electrical stimuli, and also showed that when the plants were given poison or anesthetic, their reactions started to work and became zero later
 lekin yah pratikriya zinc dhaatu ne nahin dikhaai jab use oksalik acid ke saath treet kiya gaya
 In 1917 Jagdish Chandra Bose was conferred the title of "knight" and was soon elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London for Physical and Biology
 bose ne apana puraa shodhakarya bina kisi achche upkaran or prayogshaala ke kiya tha isaliye jagadish chandra bose ek acchhee prayogshaala banane kii soch rahe the

 Sunday fast story According to the story of Sunday Vrat Katha, there was an old lady, the rule of her life was that every Sunday morning, she used to bathe in the morning and purify the house with dung
 iske baad vah bhojan taiyaar karti thi, bhagwaan ko bhoga laga kar swayan bhojan grahan karti thi
 She had been doing this activity for a long time
 aansa karne se uskaa ghar sabhi dhan - dhaany se paripurna tha
 That old lady used to bring cow dung of another old cow living in Padaos to cleanse her house
 jis ghar se vah budhiya gobar laati thi, vah vichaar karne lagi ki yah mere gaay kaa hi gobar kyon lekar aati he
 So she tied her cow inside the house
 budhiya gobar na milane se ravivaar ke din apane ghar ko gobar se lip kar shuddh na kar saki
 Due to this, neither did he prepare food nor did he indulge
 Thus, he fasted on that day
 raatri hone par vah bhukhi hi so gai
 Lord Surya Dev came in his night and asked him the reason for this
 The old man told what was the reason
 tab bhagwaan ne kaha ki, mata tumhen sarvakaamana poorak gaay dete hai, bhagwaan ne use vardaan main gaay di, dhan or putr diya
 And by granting the boon of salvation, they became enlightened
 In the morning, when he opened his eyes, he found a beautiful cow and calf in the courtyard
 vriddha ati prasann ho gai
 When his neighbor saw the cow calf tied outside the house, he got jealous
 Also saw that cow has dung of gold
 usne vah gobar apni gaayt ke gobar se badal diya
 By doing this daily, the old lady did not even know about it
 bhagwaan ne dekha, ki chaalaak padosan budhiya ko thag rahi he, to unhone jor kii aandhi chalaa di
 The old lady tied the cow inside the house
 subah hone par usne gaay ke sone ke gobar ko dekha, to uske aashcharya kii seemaa naa rahi
 Now she started tying the cow inside itself
 udhar padosan ne irshyaa se raja ko shikaayat kar di, ki budhiya ke paas raajaaon ke yogya gaay he, jo sona detii he
 The king heard this and asked his messengers to get the cow
 budhiya ne viyog main, akhand vrath rakhe rakhaa
 On the other hand, the king's palace was filled with cow dung
 raja ne raat ko use spane main gaay lautaane ko kaha
 praatah hote hi raja ne aisa hi kiya
 At the same time, given proper punishment to the neighborhood
 raja ne sabhi nagar vaasiyon ko vrath rakhane kaa nirdesh diya
 From then on, all the townsmen started observing this fast
 or ve khushiyon ko praapt hue
ravivaar ke vrath ke vishay main yah kaha jaataa he ki is vrath ko surya ast ke samay hi samaapt kiya jaataa he
 If for some reason the sun sets and the fasting person cannot eat food, then he should not remain foodless till sunrise the next day
 agle din bhi snanadi se nivruth hokar, surya bhagwaan ko jal dekar, unka samaran karne ke baad hi bhojan grahan karnaa chahie

 germany main, bachaler of ejineering ko bologna prakriya ke karyanvayan ke ek hisse ke rup main shuru kiya gaya tha
 However, this degree is actually awarded mostly by the German Fachshule Institutions Universities of Applied Sciences

 The situation in Finland is similar to that of Germany
 vokational universities peshewar snaatak kii degree ko manjuuri pradaan karte hai
 This degree traditionally does not prepare for further study, but due to the Bologna process, a completely new degree ylempi insinööri has been introduced for those engineers with some experience of working

lk / Yohan Wolfgang Phan Goethe was a writer, philosopher and thinker from Germany
 unhone kavita, naatak, dharm, maanavtaa or vigyaan jaise vividh kshetron main kaary kiya
 His written play Faust holds a high position in world literature
 gothe kii duusari rachanaaon main "soro of yang varter" shaamil he
 Gothe is regarded as one of Germany's greatest literary figures, who started the movement known as Wimmer Classicism in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
 vemar andolan bodh, samvednaa or romantism kaa milajula rup he
 He translated Kalidasa's Abhigyan Shakuntalam into German
 gete ne abhigyaan shaakuntalam ke bare main kaha tha- Goethe's 82-year long life is related to an era of European history that has been considered a time of great revolutions and upheavals
 uske yuvavastha ke aarambh main german sahitya main kranti kaa udai hua, jiske falswaroop puraani manyataon tathaa saahitiyik siddhanton kaa teevr virodh hua or kavi tathaa kalakaar kii swatantraaa tathaa rashtriya sahitya ke puraane gaurav ke punaruddhar kaa joardaar samarthan hua
 In this 'stormy era', the spirit of revolution appeared like a raging storm, which razed the ruins of old ideas and shabby principles
 iske pashchaat uske jivan ke madhyahn main france kii raajnneetik kranti kaa tufaan aayaa jisane puraani vyavastha kii bhitti hilaa di or lakhon vyaktiyon ke hriday main swarnyug ke sundar swapn kaa srijan kiya, yadhyapi yah swapn mrigamarichika ke samaan hi kshanik siddh hua, kyonki isi ke garbh se napolian kaa aavirbhaav hua, jisaki drutagami vijayvahini ne europe main aashaa ke sthaan par purna nairashya kaa samrajya sthapit kiya
 Finally, in the twilight of his life, he fully experienced the extensive changes of the Industrial Revolution and also saw the rise of the new economic system which was slowly becoming clear by breaking the old structure of the society
 in sabhi anubhavon kii chhap uski kritiyon main spasht he, kyonki uskaa samvedansheel hriday bahya paristhitiyon se twarit prabhavit hota tha
 He was a very lucky man
 uske jivan main abhaav kii chaaya kabhi nahin ai
 Nature had given her the gift of beauty and health as well as her versatility which made her successful and prestigious in various fields
 vah keval kavi yaa kalakaar hi nahin tha, apitu ek safal vaigyanik, sadhak tathaa darshanik bhi tha
 He had authority over many languages of Europe; His knowledge was infinite and in the princely state of Beemer, he spent a valuable part of his life in responsible work like governance and theater operations
 in baton ko dhyaan main rakhane par yah samajhane main kathinaayee nahin hogi ki usne german sahitya ke sabhi angon ko sabal tathaa susamrudh banaaya or usapar itnaa gaharaa tathaa vyapak prabhaav daalaa ki uske pashchaat shaayad hi koi labdhpratishth german kavi yaa kalakaar usase achoota bachaa ho
 His strong writing created an abundance of lyrical poetry, epics, novels, plays, and critical works, and he did not touch any subject leaving him unaffected by his power, novelty and originality
 gete kii vibhinn kritiyon main uske vyaktigat anubhavon kaa samavesh hua he or un sabhi ko ek sutara main baandhanevaala tatv uskaa vyaktitv he jo samay ke saath saath viksit hota rahaa
 Therefore, it can be said that his moral, intellectual and spiritual character is contained in his various works
 jivan ke vasant kaal main uski bhavanaayen teevr tathaa saral thim or uskaa abhivyanjan saral kintu joardaar bhashaa main hota tha jo bhavuk hriday kaa naiysargik udgaar prathit hoti thi
 But with the maturation of Mastash, the dignity of the sentiment and the sophistication of the language and the complexity of the verses began to grow and eventually his words became burdensome with the expressions and the expressions of the heart were controlled by the discipline of the mind
 iskaa arth yah he ki usne apane vyaktitv kii virdohi pravritiyon main samanvay sthapit karne kaa safal prayaas kiya or uskaa samast sahitya tathaa darshan isi tarah se samanvay ke punit kartavya kaa upadesh detaa he
 He emphasized that the introverted nature of man is harmful and it is necessary to make it extroverted so that there can be healthy harmony between the individual and society, soul and external nature
 is tathy kaa parichay uski sabhi kritiyon main miltaa he
 His lyrical poetry begins with personal love, but in the long run his strong connection to man and nature is his main subject - the nature that is cosmic and with which the soul of man has an unwavering relationship because the diverse beings of creation are tied in the thread of unity
 uske teen pradhan upanyaas bhi uske vikaas ke teen vibhinn pahaluon ke dyotak hai
 The first and most well-known among them is 'vardar', an impressive portrait of the soul of 'romantic' Europe
 yah aise navayuvak kaa chitra he jo jivan se ub gaya he kyonki bahya jagat main uske liye koi ras yaa saar nahin he
 His heart is filled with bizarre depression and in the end his isolation becomes so bitter that he ends up in suicide
 gete ke baad ke likhe hue do upanyaas ‘vilhem mistr’ or iskaa parvarti sanskaran style ke vikaas ke saath hi saath vyakti tathaa samaaj ke saamanjasy kaa maarg prashast karte hai or aakhri granth main to lekhak ne audyogic yugin samaaj vyavastha tathaa usamen nihit samasyaon kaa safal tathaa sajiv vishleshan kiya he
 Plays have a special place in Goethe's works and the main ones are 'gotze', 'yagmant', 'ifegini', 'taso' and 'foust'
 yahan par itnaa kahana hi paryaapt hoga ki ‘foust’ gete kii pratibha kaa sarvottam pratik tathaa vishwasahitya kaa amuly ratna he
 The history of its creation is the history of the development of 'goethe' and the life story of the protagonist of the play is the story of the development of the human soul
 ‘foust’ madhyayugin loksahitya kaa purvaparichit paatr he jisko gete ne maanavtaa kaa pratik mana he
 This person is initially beset with ego like a warder, but gradually his mind is attracted towards other persons and the external world
 pehla charan ek abodh ladki se prem he jiskaa ant du:khamay siddh hota he, phir uskaa pravesh samaaj main hota he or hellen ke sampark main aakar vah karm kii upadeyata kaa paath padhata he or ant main ek vistrut bhukhand kaa swami hokar uske vikaas main laga hua apni jeevanalila samaapt karata he
 The explanation of 'faust' is quite detailed
 gete kii paini drushti ne bahut se tatwon kaa avishkaar kiya jinka viksit rup kalantar main bodhgamy hua
 His works contain the core tenets of evolutionism and Marxism and they also find substantial support for the ideology that made autocratic rulers and leaders like Hitler popular in Germany and worthy of the public's reverence and worship, although all their power was the work of demolition
 i wasted angreji ke prasiddh kavi ornald ne gete ko ‘louh yug kaa chikitsak’ bataaya he, par gete ke vichaar aaj bhi naveen tathaa sajiv hai
 The words of praise he has used for Kalidasa's Shakuntal are also suitable for his creations - because even the Saurabh of Vasantha and the sweet juice of Shishir are perfectly mixed
 jawahar laal rohtagi,bharat ke uttar pradesh kii pratham vidhansabha sabha main vidhayak rahe
 In the 1952 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections, he participated in the elections on behalf of the Congress from 132 - Kanpur Nagar Legislative Assembly constituency in Kanpur district of Uttar Pradesh
 jaise jihva ke aswaad ke chah ras prasiddh hai usee prakaar hriday ke aswaad ke nau ras prasiddh hai
 The taste of lingua is placed in the category of cosmic bliss because it is directly related to cosmic objects
 hriday ke aswaad ko alokik anand kii koti main mana jaataa he kyonki uskaa sidhaa samb Indian poetesses have considered the number of rasas to be nine only because by their opinion there are only nine expressions which are closely related to the basic instincts of man and have full potential for stability and they can only be developed and said to possess the noun of rasa
 Huh
 yah manyata vivaadaaspad bhi rahi he, parantu hasya kii rasarupata ko sabhi se nirvivaad rup se sweekaar kiya he
 Psychology experts have also given Haas a proper place as the original trend and have given adequate consideration in its analysis
 is manan chintan ko paurvatya kavyachaaryon kii apeksha paashchaatya kavyachaaryon ne vistaarpurvak abhivyakti di he, parantu phir bhi yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki unhone is tatv kaa puri vyapaktaa ke saath adhyayan kar liya he or yaa hasyaras yaa haas kii kavyagat abhivyanjana kii hi koi aisi paribhaasha de di he jo sabhi sabhi prakaar ke udaahranon ko apane main samet sake
 Indian Acharyas have promulgated this in a form of formulas, but in their brief statements, almost all the findings and elements of Western critics can be easily seen
 hasyaras ke liye bharat muni kaa naatyashaastra kahata he- It is written in Bhavaprakash- sahityadarpanakaar kaa kathan he- The phrase of the decider is- taatpary yah he ki haas ek pritiparak bhav he or chittavikas kaa ek rup he
 He is perplexed by distorted shape, distorted speech, distorted ethics, distorted designation, distorted decking, distorted semantics, distorted speech, distorted gestures, etc
 - the humor with these distortions, whether of the actor, of the speaker, or of anyone else
 
 vikruti kaa taatpary he pratyaashit se vipareet athwa vilakshan koi aisa vaichitrya, koi aisa betukapan, jo hamen pritikar jaan pade, kleshkar na jaan pade
 These traits include almost all the symptoms of western critics, as far as they are concerned with humor subjects
 aisa haas jab viksit hokar hamen kavikaushal dwaara saadharaneekrut rup main, athwa acharya pan
 ramchandra shukla kii shabdaawalee ke anusaar, mukt dasha main praapt hota he, vah hasyaras kehalaata he
 The expression of the sense of Haas remains relative to the country
 ghar par koi khuli deh baitha ho to darshak ko hansee na aavegi parantu utsav main bhi vah isi tarah pahunch jaae to uskaa aacharan pratyaashit se vipareet yaa vikrut mana jane ke kaaran hansee jagaa degaa; uskaa vyavhaar haas kii janani ho jayega
 If a young person is adorned, it is a matter of boredom, but a shabby old man will have a reason for adornment; We will surely start laughing at the wrestler who has fallen from the chair, but only our compassionate sympathy will grow on the child falling from the roof
 yah pehle hi kaha gaya he ki haas kaa aadhaar priti par hota he na ki dwesh par, atev yadi kisi kii prakruti, pravriti, swabhaav, aachaar aadi kii vikruti par kataaksh bhi karnaa ho to vah katukti ke rup main nahin kintu priyokti ke rup main hogi, uski tah main jalan athwa nicha dikhaane kii bhaavana na hokar vishuddh sanshuddhi kii bhaavana hogi
 This eloquence with a sense of purification will not be in the vocabulary of preaching but in the terminology of Ranjata
 hasya ke bhedon par bhi aacharyon ne vichaar kiya he
 He made two distinctions of humor
 ek he aatmasth or doosraa he parastha
 From the point of view of comedians, selfish humor is automatically the laughing of that character and superstitious humor is to make others laugh
 saamaajikon yaa sahruday shrotaaon, athwa natyadarshakon kii drushti se aatmasth hasya he anyon kii hansee ke bina swat: unamem udbhut hasya or parastha hasya he dusron ko hansataa hua dekhakar unamem utpann hasya
 By understanding this difference of perspectives, the idea of the meanings of these two words can be easily eliminated
 phir, aacharyon ne hasya ke chah bhed kiye hai - smit, hasith, vihasit, upahasit, avahasit or atihasit; jinhen bhavbhed nahin kintu hasankriya ke hi bhed maananaa padegaa
 In short, smiling eyes are smitten
 battisi dikh padana hasith he, ho hi kii si dhwani nikal padana vihasit he
 Rise of limb is absent
 pet pakadaneyvaali hansee avahasit he or puure thahaakevali jhakzorkarini paslithod hansee atihasit he
 The philosopher has called Smit and Hasit worthy of the best
 vihasit or upahasit ko madhyam vargeey logon ke yogya or apasit tathaa atihasit ko neech logon ke yogya kaha he
 There should be a dignity in the theater for the audience to laugh, even from that point of view, it may be considered good, moderate, inadequate
 nahin to jhakzor denevaali hansee keval nichon kii vastu samaj lene se ucch vargeey lok swasthya ke ek mahatvapurn tatv se vanchit rah jaaenge
 Dr
 Ramkumar Varma has considered three distinctions of humor with a desire for the effect of Uttam, Madhyam, Adham and has written twelve distinctions of Hasan Kriya by multiplying them with Athastha, Prastha
 smit, hasith aadi hasankriyaabhedon ko hasya kaa anubhav hi kaha ja saktaa he
 It is a different thing to just describe these experiences and it is a different thing to create these experiences in the social through your creation
 hasyaras kii safal rachana vah he jo hasyaras ke anubhav anayas utpann kara de
 There are five major differences of humor from the opinion of foreign scholars, namely Humer, Witt, Satire, Irony and Fars
 humar or fars hasya ke vishay se sambandhit hai jabaki bit, satair or irni kaa sambandh ukti ke kaushal se he jinamein pichley do kaa uddeshy keval santushti hi na hokar sanshuddhi bhi rahaa karata he
 Parody is also a genre of humor that has a relationship with the above skills but whose main purpose is satisfaction
 irni kaa arth parihaas chintya he
 In ridicule, we think, Irony should also be considered to have an inferiority or else it will become an object out of humor
 vit athwa vagvaidadhya ko ek vishisht alankaar kaha ja saktaa he
 The tithes of Indian literary scholars have done justice to Shringar, even with humor, though Bharata Muni has given its origin to Shringar i
e
 it is considered to be the magnitude of Rati or Preity and it was only after Shringar that the status of importance in Navaras Have given
 anand ke saath iskaa sidhaa sambandh he or na keval ranjanta kii drushti se kintu upyogita kii drushti se bhi isaki apni vishistataa he
 This body removes the tension of the mind, eradicates the grit of nature, paves the way for social improvement with introspection and self-refinement, eliminating the tiredness of the individual and society, fostering freshness in them and becoming a benefactor of public health
 yah nishchit he ki sanskrit sahitya tathaa hindi sahitya main is hasyaras ke mahatv ke anupaat se iske uttam udaahranon kii kami hi he
 Yet from the historical overview it is also clear that the flow of humor in literature has been going on continuously since the Vedic period till today, although before the present period, it is not as diverse as it is seen today
 hasyaras kii dhara ke vaividhya ko vishay or vyanjana kii drushti se dekha ja saktaa he
 We can divide the subject into shape, nature, situation, dress, speech, behavior and object
 akruti kaa betukapan he motopa, kurupata, bhaddaapan, angabhang, beja najaakat, tond, kubad, naariyon kaa atyant kaalaapan, aadi
 Humorous compositions have been done on many of these subjects
 dhyaan dene yogya baat he ki ek samay kaa haasyaaspad vishay sabhi samayon kaa haasyaaspad vishay ho jaae, aisa nahin hua karata
 Today, disgrace, cleanliness, etc
 are not considered as the subjects of humor, hence, making compositions on them will not be considered as a symbol of humor
 prakruti yaa swabhaav kaa betukapan he ujaddpan, bevakoofi, paakhand, jhenp, khushaamad, amaryadit fashanparasti, kanjusee, dikhaava panditmanyata, atihasypatrata, anadhikarpurn ahanmanyta, aadi
 Composing the absurdity of nature as your goal is more expansive than the absurdity of nature
 rachanakaaron ne kanjusee aadi kii vrittiyon par achche vyang kiye hai, parantu abhi is disha main anek vishay achoote hi chhot gaye hai
 The absurdity of the situation is the added Gangmadari, the lapse of time, the helplessness of a person etc
 in the incompatibility of society
 iskaa atyant sundar udhaaharan he ramcharitamanas kaa kevat prasang jisamen ram kaa marm samaj jane kii ding haakanevaale murkh kintu panditmanya kevat ko ram koi uttar nahin de pate or ek prakaar se chupchaap aatmasamarpan kar dete hai
 It was a satire of circumstance
 vesh kaa betukapan, haspaatr naton or vidushakon kaa priy vishay hi rahaa he or prahasanon, ramlilaon, raasalilaon, "gammat", tamaashon aadi main aasaani se diya ja saktaa he
 Dharmadhvajis disguise, disguised fashionistas, "masculine woman" disguise are absurd ones that can be the subject of creation
 vesh ke betukepan kii rachana bhi akruti ke betukepan kii rachana ke samaan praaia: chhichley darje kii hogi
 The absurdity of speech is to stutter, to put a pillowcase like "which is so" on the matter, to utter ejaculations, inhuman sounds, boiling of boonies, gossiping, panditau, ganwaru language, slang of many language words, etc
 vyavhaar kaa betukapan he asamanjas ghatnaayen, foohad harakatein, atiranjana, charitrik vikruti, saamaajik uchhrankhaltaayen, kuch kaa kuch samaj baithna, kah baithna yaa kar baithna, kathputlipan ityadi
 The absurdity of behavior can provide abundant material for the expression of humor, whether it is in the sense of humor or ridicule
 vastu kii drushti se manushya hi kyon, dev daanav pashu pakshi, khatmal machhar, jhaadoo, tokani, plate rashning aadi anek vishyon par safaltarpuk kalmen chalaai gai hai
 But as far as the fun of these items and especially with the favored gods and administrative satire, will be said to be an officer of the category of humor
 khizabhari anya rachanaayen raudra, vibhats yaa anya rason kii koti main pahunch ja sakati hai
 The expression of anticipation in expression can be seen and shown in many ways
 ise betukapan, vikruti, asamanjasata aadi shabdon se thik thik nahin samajhaayaa ja saktaa
 It is the speech that requires enough talent even in the creator and in the creator, listener or reader of that creation
 jis saamaajik main hasya kii ichha or aashaa na hogi, swabhaav main vinodpriyata or hasyonmukhataa na hogi tathaa buddhi ke shabdasanketon or vaakyagat angon ko samajhane kii kshamta na hogi, samajhnaa chahie ki uske liye hasyaras kii rachanaayen he hi nahin
 Similarly, an artist who does not have sophistication, counterproductive and the art of word weighing cannot be a successful writer of humor
 safal lekhak apratyaashit shabdadambar ke sahare, shabd kii apratyaashit vyutpatti ke sahare ; apratyaashit vilakshan upamaaon aadi alankaaron ke sahare ; vilakshan tarkoktiyon ke sahare ; vagvaidagdhya kii anek vidhaon ke sahare yatha, arth ke pher badal ke sahare pratyutar main nahale kii jagah dahala lagane kii kala ke sahare ; satair ke sahare "", krishnayan main uddhav kii ukti kii bhawan jaraihai madhupuri, shyaam bajaihain benu? bhavaniprasad mishra ji kaa geetfarosh aadi), kataaksh ke sahare ke sahare ; virup vachananukaran ke sahare ; tathaa isi prakaar kii anekanek abhivyanjana shaileyon se hasyaras kaa udrek karaayaa karte hai
 From our point of view, in our understanding humor is either especially of humor or of ridicule
 in donon shabdon ko hamane paramparaagat arth main seemaabaddh nahin kiya he
 We consider the satisfaction of poetry as a category of gimmick and the one who is pure in a sense of ridicule
 anek rachanaaon main donon kaa mishran bhi hua karata he
 It is necessary to take care of the list of socials for both humor and ridicule
 maansal shringarparak haas, aajkal ke shisht samaaj ko ruchikar nahin ho saktaa
 The satirical deity is used to make the cuckoos laugh
 uphaas ke liye suruchi kaa dhyaan atyant aavashyak he
 The fun in this is that the comedian should understand his errors but also be taken care of by the signer and do not see it as a preacher
 bina vyang ke haas ko parihaas samajhie, chaahe vah varnanaatmak ho chaahe vaartalap kii koti kaa or apane par athwa anya par, visheshat: anya par, vyang karke jo prabhaav dikhaaya jaataa he vah uphaas he hi
 The harm generated by the use of bits, humors, parodies, etc
, which is of the order of pure satisfaction, will be called a joke
 anubhav kii drushti se hasyaras ko mriduhas kii koti kaa samajhnaa chahie yaa attas kii koti kaa
 Other categories like Hasit, Kidnapped etc
 should be taken into account
 mriduhas ke do bhi kiye ja sakate hai, ek he gupt haas jiskaa anand man hi man liya jaataa he or doosraa he sfoot haas jiskaa muskaraahat aadi ke rup main anya jan bhi darshan kar sakate hai
 Two distinctions can also be made of attahas - one is the restrained hay which is controlled by the laughing situation and the other is the amaryad hasa in which the situation is not aware of relativity
 hasya ke bhedon kaa yah vivechan sambhavat: adhik vaigyanik hoga
 Skit in the plays and the presence of the clown have created humor but have not been versatile
 subhashit ke kai shloke avashya achche ban pade hai jinamein vishay or ukti donon drushtiyon se hasya kii acchhee avatarana kii gai he
 It will not be irrelevant to give some examples
 devataaon ke sambandh kaa majaak dekhie
 The question was why did Shankar ji drink poison? The poet's answer is that bored with the condition of his family
 shankar ji kaa saanp ganesh ji ke chuuhe kii taraf jhapat rahaa he kintu swat: usapar kartikeya ji kaa mor daanv lagaae hue he
 On the other hand, the lion of Girija is keeping a watchful eye on Ganesh ji's gajamastak and Girija ji is also frantically keeping a soutiadaah from the Ganges
 samarth hokar bhi bechaare shankar ji is besangi gruhasthi se kaise paar pate, isliye uubakar jehar pi liya
 Tridev does not sleep on the bed
 jaan padataa he khatmalon se ve bhi bhaybheet ho chuke hai
 The son-in-law considers his mother-in-law a matter of essence, but still what rudeness does he expect to get his worship done or see in the following verses
 donon hi shloke paryaapt kavyagunayukt hai
 The more you analyze, the more you will enjoy: parann priy ho ki praan, isapar kavi kaa nishkarsh suniye- Raja Bhoj had announced that the one who created the new verse would get one lakh rupees in the prize, but no one was able to get the award because the meritorious courtier Pandit would repeat the new verse as soon as he heard it and thus declare it old
 kinvadanti ke anusaar kalidas ne nimna shloke sunaakar boli band kar di thi
 In the verse, the poet has claimed that the king should free the father from ninety-nine million jewels and take the evidence of the pandits on it
 yadi panditgan kahen ki yah daawa unhen vidit nahin he to phir is nae shloke kii rachana ke liye ek lakh die hi jaaen
 The "kaisa Chhakaaya" sense of it is embodied with great beauty: hindi ke virgthakaal, bhaktikaal or reetikaal praaia: padyon ke hi kaal rahe hai
 In this long period, the compositions of humor have been rare, but they have often been in the form of retail
 tulsidas ji ke ramcharimanas kaa naradamoh prasang shivvivaah prasang, parashuram prasang aadi or surdaas ji ke sursagar kaa makhanchori prasang, uddhav-gopi-samvaad prasang aadi alabatta hasya ke achche udhaaharan prastut karte hai
 The following verse of Tulsidas ji, in which a funny pinch has been made on the Shringarlalasa of Jarajarjar ascetics, is unique in its verses- birbal ke chutkule, laal bujhakkad ke latake, ghaagh or bhaddari kii sukhtiyaan, giradhar kaviry or gang ke chand, benny kaviraj ke bhadauve tathaa or bhi kai rachanaayen is kaal kii prasiddh hai
 Bharatjeevan Press published some compilation of retail comedies of this period in its "bharova collection"
 is kaal main, visheshat: daan ke prasang ko lekar, kuch maarmik rachanaayen hui hai jinaki rochakata aaj bhi kam nahin kahi ja sakati
 See example - ek sum ne sankat main tuladaan karnaa kabool kar liya tha
 For that, look at his tricks to lose weight - vartmaan kaal main hasya ke vishyon or unki abhivyakti karne kii shaileyon kaa bahut vistaar hua he
 In this era, along with poetry, many genres of prose have also developed
 pramukh hai naatak tathaa ekanki, upanyaas tathaa kahaniyaan, evam niabandh
 In all these genres, abundant literature is written and is being written to suit the humor
 pratibhashali lekhakon ne padya ke saath hi gadhy kii vividh vidhaon main bhi apni hasyarasvardhini rachanaayen prastut kii hai
 The most famous litterateur of the early days of this era is Bharatendu Babu Harishchandra
 inke naatakon main vishuddh hasyaras kam, vagvaidagdhya kuch adhik or uphaas paryaapt maatra main paaya jaataa he
 "vaidiki Violence Violence Na Bhavati", "andher Nagri" etc

 Lala Srinivasa Das, Pratapnarayan Mishra, Radhakrishnadas, Premaghan, Balakrishna Bhatt etc
 of his era have also composed comedies
 pratapanarayan mishra ne "kalikauthuk roopak" naamak sundar prahasan likhaa he
 His poem titled "budhapa" is a masterpiece of pure humor
 us samay angreji rajya apane gaurav par tha jisaki pratyaksh aalochana khatre se khaali nahin thi
 Therefore, litterateurs, especially satire and derision were the way to go and tried to awaken the reformist social consciousness through sipa, hajo, quibble, satire etc
 bhaaratendukaal ke baad mahaviraprasad dvivedi kaal aayaa jisane hasya ke vishyon or unki abhivyanjana pranaaliyon kaa kud or adhik parishkar evam vistaar kiya
 In plays, the purpose of humor, which used to play an antecedent or a sequel to the main story, often ended in the Dwivedi period, and the subject was no longer necessary for the genre of humor
 kavy main "sargau narak thekana naahin" sadrush rachanaayen saraswati aadi patrikaon main saamne ai
 Balmukund Gupta and Pt
 Jagannath Prasad Chaturvedi were good writers of humor in that era
 pratham ne "bhashaa kii ansthirataa" naamak apni lekhamala "atmaram" naam se likhi or duusare sajjan ne "nirankushta-nidarshan" naamak lekhamala "mansaram" naam se
 Both of them have clashed with Dwivedi in these garlands and his discussion of this idea remained for a long time among the literati
 balmukund gupt ji kaa shivashambhu kaa chittha, chandradhar sharma guleri kaa kachuva dharm, mishrabandhu or badrinath bhatta ji ke anek naatak, shri harishankar sharma ke niabandh, naatak aadi, ganga prasad shrivastav or ugr ji ke anek prahasan or anek kahaniyaan, apane apane samay main jansadharan main khub samaadrut hui

 We can call Annapurnanand Verma the special writer of humor
 unke "mahakavi chachcha", "meri hazaamat," "magan rahu chola", mangal mod", "man mayur" sabhi suruchipurna hai
 In the present period, Upendranath Ashk has written many new ideas like "lift the curtain, drop the curtain" etc
 dow ramkumar verma kaa ekanki sangrah "rimjhim" is kshetra main mile kaa pathar mana gaya he
 He has given good samples of smite humor

 sanganak program kisi kaary vishesh ko sanganak dwaara karaane athwa karne ke liye sanganak ko samaj aane vaali bhashaa main diye gaye nirdesho kaa samooh hota he
 In order to program any program, first of all the specifications of the program are well understood
 program main prayog kii gai sabhi sharto kaa anupaalan sahi prakaar se ho rahaa he yaa nahi, yah bhi jaanch liya jaataa he
 Now after checking and understanding all the specifications of the program, all the instructions from the beginning of the program till the desired result is achieved, that is, the design of the programs is done
 program kii dizin ko bhalee-bhaanti jaanchakar, program kii koding kii jaati he evam program ko compail kiya jaataa he
 The program checks the program by inputting test data to see if the correct result is actually being obtained
 yadi parinaam sahi nahin hote hai to iskaa arth he ki program ke kisi nirdesh kaa kram galat he athwa nirdesh kisi sthaan par galat diya gaya he
 If the result is obtained correctly, then the order of instructions given in the program is unified and this sequence of instructions is installed in the computer
 is prakaar krmanudesan kii sampoorn prakriya sampann hoti he
 The following characteristics are desirable in any high-quality program
 sanganak ke kaary karne kii prakriya atyant jatil hoti he
 a computer has its own memory but no intelligence
 sanganak maatr vahi kaary karata he, jiskaa ki use nirdesh diya jaataa he;arthath sanganak ko kaary kii buddhi krambaddh nirdesho athwa program dwaara di jaati he
 In the computer, the program is fed by typing on the keyboard, in the program, what the computer wants to do, what type and type of information is written in a clear and ordered form
 kalpana kijiye ki kisi vyakti ko do cap chaay banane kaa kaary diya gaya
 Now we have to give all the instructions related to making tea to the computer in a certain order
 yadi nirdesh maukhik rup se dene ho to ye nimnanusaar honge:-1
rasoi ghar main jaaen
 2
 Take a cup
 3
pani kii toti kholen
 4
 Close the basin by filling the cup with water
 5
cap ko sleb par rakh den
 6
 Take tea
 7
slab par rakhe cap kaa pani chaay ke bhagone main ulat de
 8
 Place the rice cooker on the gas burner
 9
gas liter jalaaye
 10
 Turn on the gas knob with one hand and light the lighter as well
 11 yadi gas nahin jalati he to nob ko of kare or ab kramank 9 vaali kriya ko doharaaye
 12
 If the gas burns, then let the tea water boil until it starts boiling
 13
 pani garam hone kii avadhi main chaay va chini kaa dibba jin par kramash: chaay or chini likhaa he; or ek chammach apane paas rakh len
 14
 After boiling the water, open half a teaspoon of tea and then open a box of sugar and add one teaspoon of sugar to it
 15
chaay va chini ke dibbo ko band karke jahaan se uthaaye the vahi rakh de
 16
 Now take one cup of milk from the milk pan
 17
ab pani ke punah ubalane par usame cap kaa doodh daale
 18
 Turn off the gas knob after boiling this mixture
 19
ek trey le
 20
 Place two plates separately in this tray
 21

 22
 Now take tea sieve and extractor
 23
sandasi se chaay ke bhagone ko pakadkar chanani ek cap ke upar rakhkar chaay chhaanie or tab tak chhaanie jab tak kii cap 80% na bhar jaye
 24
 Repeat the action with serial number 23 for the second cup
 25
dono kapo main chaay bhar jane ke pashchaat chanani va chaay ke bhagone ko sinc main rakh dijie
 You saw that instructions for making tea were given in a clear and certain order
 ye nirdesh kisi aanse vyakti se bhi chaay banavaane ke liye paryaapt he jisane kabhi chaay na banaai ho
 Similarly, to do any work with the computer, he is given instructions in clear and definite order, and this process is computer programming
 sanganak keval masini bhashaa samajhataa he
 In programs written in various programming languages, instructions are converted to machine language with the help of an assembler, compiler or interpreter and sent to the computer's mycoprocessor
 tabhi sanganak in nirdesho kaa paalan kar upyukt parinaam prastut karata he
 The machine language is made up of groups of only binary digits, ie 0 to 1, which the computer's microprocessor can understand directly
 jab ham sanganak ko koi bhi nirdesh kisi input ke madhyam se dete hai to sanganak swatah in nirdesho ko ASCII Code main parivartit kar saktaa he
 To give instructions, we usually have to press the "keys" of the letters, numbers and signs on the keyboard and the computer automatically converts them into its own language
 example-typemasini bhashaa main -T y PE It is very important to give instructions to the computer in a programmatic manner, in very clear language and in detail
 sanganak ko kaary vishesh karne ke liye ek program banaakar dena hota he
 The clearer, detailed and accurate the given program is, the more smoothly the computer will work, the less will be the mistakes and the more correct answers will be given
 yadi program aspasht hoga or usame samuchit vivaran evam spasht nirdesh nahin honge to yah sambhav he ki sanganak bina parinaam nikaale hi gananaa karata rahe athwa usase praapt parinaam aspasht or nirarthak ho
 Therefore, the program should be prepared with utmost care and concentration
 sanganak kii sampoorn kaaryakshmata yojanevalverthaat program banane vaale vyakti kii kshamta par nirbhar hoti he
 The computer does not have any intelligence
 yah ek mastishk rahit evam atyant aagyaakaari mashin he
 Even if he is not given any instructions or given vague instructions, he still does not object and works only as per the instructions given
 atah program banaate samay atyant saavdhaanee baratani padati he
 It is necessary to keep the following points in mind while making a program on the computer: - program main diye jane vaale nirdesho ko ek pravaah talika ke rup main prastut karnaa uchit hota he
 In this, it should be clear when and what the computer has to do and how it should perform various activities
 program ko upar se neeche kii ore pravaah chitra ke rup main darshaya jaataa he evam jahaan tark aadi karnaa hota he vahaan yah do bhaago main vibhakt kar diya jaataa he
 It is necessary to write the instructions in the program in a language that is understandable to the computer; So that the computer can understand the instructions provided and work according to them to produce the desired result
 ek baar program ko sanganak bhashaa main likhane ke baad ise sanganak kii smriti main arthath flopy, chumbakeey feete, chhidrit card aadi nivesh yuktiyo par ankit kar diya jaataa he
 Also, the data required to solve this problem is also provided to the input unit of the computer
 ab sanganak us program ke anusaar kaary karke input data kaa vishleshan pradarshit karke uchit parinaam prastut karata he
 If instructions have been given to display the results received in the program on the monitor screen or to print them on a floppy, hard disk or magnetic tape, then the computer marks the results received there

 The Samhita of the Rig Veda is called ‘rikasamhita’
 vastut: 'ruk' kaa arth he- 'stutiparak mantra or 'samhita' kaa abhipraay sankalan se he

 yadi kisi nalee main sodium kii bhaap bhari ho or uske bheetar se balb kaa prakaash bhejkar bahirgat prakaash kaa spectrum liya jaae to uske pile bhaag main do kaali rekhaayen pai jaati hai
 The reason for this is that sodium itself gives a linear spectrum when excited
 is spectrum main do pilo rekhaayen bhi hoti hai jinhen sodium kii "di" rekhaayen kaha jaataa he
 When the light of the bulb passes through the steam of sodium, the sodium absorbs the character corresponding to the d lines and two black lines are formed at this place in the light
 is spectrum kaa avasorana spectrum kehete hai
 There are also three types of absorption spectrums
 jis avasorana spectrum main kaali rekhaayen pai jaati hai unhen rekhiy avasorana spectrum, jinamein kaale band paae jate hai unhen band avasorana spectrum or jinamein spectrum kaa thodaa sa adhik satat kshetra hi avashoshit ho jaataa he unhen satat avasorana spectrum kehete hai

 Many electrons revolve around it in fixed orbits
 electronon kii kul sankhya nabhik ke potanon kii sankhya ke baraabar hoti he
 The number of electrons in different orbitals is also fixed
 koi bhi electron kisi niyat kaksha main hi rah saktaa he
 In fact, these orbits represent the energy position of the atom
 yadi koi electron kisi anya rikt kaksha main chalaa jaae to parmaanu kii urjasthiti badal jaati hai
 It is often not possible to remove the electrons from the inner orbits, but the electrons from the final orbit can move to the next orbit when excited by external heat or electric power
 yadi pehali kaksha main usase sambhddha urja k1 or usase thik agali kaksha main k2 he to pehali se duusari ucchtar urjasthiti main jane ke liye electron keval k2 - k1 urja hi le saktaa he

 hn arg is called a packet or "quantum" of energy
 isi prakaar jab electron anya urjastaron main sankraman karata he to bhinn-bhinn aavriti kii rashmiyaan praapt hoti hai or spectrum main tadnukool bahut si rekhaayen ban jaati hai
 According to the arrangement of electrons in molecules, atoms are found to have many electronic energy levels and different types of spectrum are obtained due to electronic transition
 parmaanuon main keval electranik urjasthitiyaan hi pai jaati hai
 Therefore, the transition of electrons emits particles of fixed wavelength and gives linear spectrum
 anuon main teen prakaar kii urja hoti he - electranik, kampanjnya or ghurnanjanya 
 The electronic energy value is even lower
 jis prakaar electranik urjasthitiyaan niyat hai usee prakaar kampanjnya or ghurnanjanya urja kii sthitiyaan bhi niyat hai
 Hence a band or band is obtained by vibrational transition
 prayek bed main ghurnanjanya sankraman se rekhaayen praapt hoti hai
 They are very close, so small spectroscopes are not seen separately and only bands of different characters are visible in the spectrum
 adhik parikshepan tathaa vibhedankshamtawale spectrodarshi se in rekhaon ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Molecules of more than two atomic molecules have even closer lines, so they are harder to see
 bahuparmanuk anuon kii ghurnanarekhaon ko dekhnaa ab tak sambhav nahin hua he
