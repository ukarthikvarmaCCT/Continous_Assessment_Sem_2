 Kashyap gave the following reason for asking Indian Ocean to make music of his film: band ne album ke liye chaar mul dhun banaae, lekin unamem se keval teen ko hi antim album main rakhaa gaya

 bhartiya talwadya, chamada madhe do drum Pakhawaj, Mridang, Khol, Dholak, Nagara, Bongo tabalaa bhartiya sangeet main prayog hone vaala ek talwadya he jo mukhya rup se dakshin asian deshon main bahut prachlit he
 It is in the form of two vertical, cylindrical, leather-plated mouth parts of wood, which are called "right" and "left" according to the tradition of placing them
 yah talwadya hindustani shastreey sangeet main kaaphi mahatvapurn he or atharahavin sadi ke baad se iskaa prayog shashtreey evam up shastreey gayan-vaadan main lagbhag anivaary rup se ho rahaa he
 Apart from this, it has also been used prominently in smooth music and Hindi cinema
 yah baaja bharat, pakistan, nepal, bangladesh, or shri lanka main prachlit he
 Earlier it was used as an instrumental instrument to give a rhythm to singing, playing, dancing etc
, but later many tabla players made it a solo playing medium and also gained considerable fame
 naam tabalaa kii utpatti arabi-farsi mul ke shabd "tabl" se bataayi jaati he
 However, the actual origin of this instrument is disputed - while some scholars consider it to be an evolved form of upward recitation in an ancient Indian tradition, some believe it to be made later than the Pakhawaj, and some also refer to its origin as western Asia
 Huh
 table kaa itihaas sateek taur par namaaloom he or isaki utpatti ke bare main kai upasthapanaayen maujuud hai
 The ideas described in relation to its origin can be divided into two groups: aupniveshik shashan ke dauraan is pariklpana ko kaaphi balpurvak purarsthapit kiya gaya ki table kii mul utpatti muslim senaaon ke saath chalane vaale jode drum se hui he; is sthapana kaa mul arabi ke "tabl" shabd par aadhaarit he jiskaa arth "drum " hota he
 The example of Babur carrying such drums with the army is presented as an example, although these instruments that accompany the Ottoman forces bear no resemblance to the tabla but to the "nakkara"
 duusari sthapana ke mutabiq, allaudin khilji ke samay main, amir khusro ne "awaz baaja" ko kaat kar table kaa rup dene kii baat kahi jaati he
 However, this also does not seem possible because none of the paintings of that time represent any such instrument
 muslim itihaaskaaron ne bhi apane vivaranon main aise kisi vaadyayantra kaa ullekh nahin kiya he
 For example, Abul Faizi has enumerated a long list of instruments in the ain-i-akbari, but the tabla is not mentioned in it
 ek anya tisare matanusaar dilli ke khyaat gayak sadaarang ke shishy or prasiddh pakhaawaj vadak rahamaan khan ke putr, amir khusro ne 1738 i main pakhaawaj se table kaa avishkaar kiya
 Earlier, Khayal used to sing pakhavaj also in singing
 is siddhant main satyata sambhavit he kyonki us samay kii laghu kalakritiyon main table se milte-julate vaadyayantra ke pramaan milte hai
 However, this suggests that the instrument originated in the Indian subcontinent's Muslim communities around Delhi and not from instruments imported from Arab countries
 nil sorrel or pandit ram narayan jaise sangitvid pakhaawaj kaat kar tabalaa banaaye jane kii is kimvadanti main bahut satyata nahin dekhte
 Believers of the theory of Indian origin believe the origin of the tabla in India and say that it only took the Arabic name in the Muslim period
 bhartiya naatyashaastra ke praneta bharat muni ke dwaara urdhvak aalingyak vaadyon ke varnan kii baat kahi jaati he
 In the same way, the genesis of the tabla is told from the pallets called "pushkar", which are carried in the hand
 "pushkar" vaadya ke pramaan chhathvin-saatvin sadi ke mandir utkeernnon main, khaastaur par mukteshwar or bhubaneshwar mandiron main, praapt hote hai
 In these artefacts, the instrumentalist is shown sitting in front of two or three different applauses and he appears to be playing them with his hands and fingers represented
 haalaanki, in nirupanon se yah nahin pataa chalata ki ye vaadyayantra unheen padaarthon se nirmit hai or charmavaadya hi hai, jaisaa kii aadhunik samay kaa tabalaa hota he
 Written evidence of the making of such instruments is available in Sanskrit texts from the materials and the form in which the tabla is made today
 "tabalaa"-jaise vaadyayantra ke nirmaan sambandhi sabase puraani jaankaree sanskrit natya shaastra main milti he
 Details related to playing these rhythms are also found in the Natyashastra
 vahiin, dakshin bhartiya granth, udaahranarth, shilappadikaaram, jisaki rachana pratham shatabdi isvi maani jaati he, lagbhag tees taal vaadyon kaa vivaran detaa he jinamein kuch rassiyon dwaara kase jane vaale or anya shaamil hai, lekin isamen "tabalaa" naamak kisi vaadya kaa vivaran nahin he
 The description of rhythm and rhythm begins with the Vedic literature itself
 do yaa teen angon vaala, doriyon ke sahare lataka kar, haathon se bajaaye jane vaale vaadya yantra "pushkar" ke pramaan paanchavin sadi main hone ke pramaan milte hai jo mrudang ke saath anya talwadyon main gine jate the, haalaanki, tab inhen tabalaa nahin kaha jaataa tha
 The murals of the Ajanta caves dating back to the fifth century represent the upward-facing drums placed on the ground
 baith kaa taal vaadya bajaate hue kalakaaron kaa aisa hi nirupan ellora kii prastar murtiyon main miltaa he, tathaa anya sthalon se bhi
 First-century chinese-tibetan travelers also get a description of the prevalence of small-sized upward drums in India
 jain or buddha granthon, jaise samavysutra, lalitvistaar or sutralankar ityadi main bhi pushkar naamak is talwadya ke vivaran milte hai
 Many Hindu and Jain temples, such as the Eklingji temple in Jaipur, Rajasthan, represent a person playing stone-shaped instruments in stone sculptures
 dakshin main yadav shashan ke samay main bhi aies tarah ke chote talwadyon kaa pramaan miltaa he jab saarangadev sangeet ratnakar kii rachana kar rahe the
 Recent bibliographical claims that tabla is dated to around 1799 are now insignificant, and images from the Bhaje caves attest to the use of such an instrument in ancient India
 jameen par rakh kar bajaaye jane vaale urdhvamukhi vaadyon ke pramaan kai hindu mandiron se praapt hue hai jo 500 ipu ke aasapaas tak ke samay ke hai
 One can take the example of Hoysaleshwara Temple, Karnatakam as evidence of the presence of such instruments in South India, in which a carving depicts a female playing tabla-like instrument in a dance ceremony
 tabalaa, bajaane kii kala ke aadhaar par mrudang or pakhaawaj se alag he
 In this, the artistic speed of the fingers of the hand is more important
 vahiin, pakhaawaj or mrudang panjon kii gati se bajaaye jate hai kyonki inpar aghat kshaitij rup se kiya jaataa he or is prakaar inke bolon main jatilta utani nahin jitani table main pai jaati he
 Hence, the similarity of tabla can be established with the three instruments in phonetic and instrumental studies; The "right", like the pakhawaj, the "left" shaped like the carpenter, the use of a drum-like gum, all three are obtained
 "tabalaa" ke do ang hote hai, arthath isamen do drum hote hai jinka aakaar or akruti ek duusare se kuch bhinnata liye hoti he
 Technically, only the organ played by a straight-handed player, rather than the right hand, is called a tabla
 aam bhashaa main ise daayan yaa dahinaa kehete hai
 It is about 15 cm in diameter and 25 cm in height
 baayen vaale hisse ko kshetra anusaar dagga, duggi athwa dhama bhi kehete hai
 Older images have found the shape of the right and left limbs to be approximately the same and sometimes smaller than the left
 haalaanki, ab bayen kaa aakaar table kii tulana main kaaphi bada hota he
 The right or tabla is often made of wood, while the left is also made of clay or both can be made of brass or flower
 bayen, chaude munh vaala, chamade madha drum hota he jiskaa aakaar lagbhag 20 centimetre vyas vaala or 25 centimetre oonchaai vaala hota he
 Between the cords on the right there are small wooden cylinders, which can be replaced by the hammering of the cords with a hammer
 is kriya ko sur milaanaa kehete hai
 The acoustics of the tabla's sound are matched with the raga's main voice "sa" during singing, which is called the tabla melding on the "plot"
 sitar ke saath, chunki taar vaadya or unchi tikshnata kaa vaadya he, table ko "pancham" par bhi milaayaa jaataa he
 The left is commonly placed in the lower vowel "mandra v" than the tabla
 kalakaar apni hatheli ke pichley hisse ke dabaav dwaara bhi baayen ke suron main maamuli badlaav kar sakate hai
 Due to asymmetry in the size of these two organs, sharp and playful speech - ta, tin, na, etc
 are played on the right and due to the large size of the left, the sound of loud sound, sound, etc
 is played on the left
 isiilie "baayen" ko "base drum" kii tarah prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 The leathers of the tabla also have three parts on the face: table ke prayek hisse ke bichobich ek kaale chakatte ke rup main jo hissaa hota he use "syaahi" kehete hai
 It is a coating made by mixing a variety of things, mainly in rice or wheat starch, which after drying has hardened, refining the natural sound of the tabla leather to give it a tinkling sound
 tabalaa nirmaan kii prakriya ke dauraan syaahi kaa samuchit prayog ek nipunata kii cheez he or is vaadyayantra kii gunvattta kaafii had tak syaahi aropan kii kushalta par nirbhar hoti he
 Some players dry the kneaded dough by sticking it to the duggy, rather than the crotch, although this process has to be done each time, and it is removed by scratching after the tabla is played
 punjab main yah abhi bhi prachlan main he or aise "baayen" ko "dhama" kehete hai
 Tabla lyrics are also called "words", "letters" or "letters"
 ye bol paramparaagat rup se likhe nahin balki guru-shishy parampara main maukhik rup se siikhe sikhaaye jate rahe hai
 That is why there is some variety in their names
 alag-alag kshetra or gharaane ke vaadan main bhi bolon kaa antar aata he
 Many ways of playing the same song are also available
 ek vivaran ke anusaar table ke mul bolon kii sankhya pandrah he jinamein se gyaarah daayen par bajaaye jate hai or chaar baayen par
 Below is a brief and generalized description of the "fundamentals of Tabla" written by David Courtney and the lyrics written by Balkrishna Garg: tabalaa vaadan ke kul chah gharaane hai: The promoter of the Delhi gharana was the Maestro reformer and besides the Punjab gharana, the other four gharanas are also considered to be an extension of the Delhi gharana
 lakhanu gharaane ke pravartak modu khaan or bakshu khaan; farrukhabad gharaane ke pravartak vilaayat ali khaan urf haji sahab; ajarada gharaane ke pravartak kallu khaan or miru khaan; banaras gharaane ke pravartak pandit ram sahay or punjab gharaane ke pravartak ustad faqirbaksh khaan the
 Among the famous tabla players are the names of Alla Rakha Khan and Zakir Hussain of the Punjab gharana
 zakir hossain ko maatr 37 varsh kii aayu main padam bhushan sammaan praapt hua or ve sabase kam umr main yah sammaan paane vaale vyakti bane, baad main unhen antarrashtriya grami puraskaar bhi praapt hua
 Chaturlal played a significant role in making tabla playing internationally

 kuch log kai prakaar ke alokik va aadhyatmik anubhav ke liye bhi inkaa seven karte hai, jaise-sadhu, sanyasi ityadi
 Since the effects of these intoxicants only last for a short time, people are forced to consume them again and again

 phosphate khanij khanijon kaa ek vishaal evam vividhapurna samooh he
 But some of these mineral groups are found more
 kuch khanij phosphate nichi diye gayi hai- The Earth's surface contains 0
11% phosphate
 yah anek dhaatuon athwa tatwon ke yogic ke rup main he
 More than 150 such minerals are known, of which one percent or more is present as phosphorus pentaoxide
 kintu prithvi kii sataha kaa adhikansh phosphorus ek hi khanij vansh se sambandhit hai, jo epetic samooh ke antargat he
 This group has a chemical formula
 is prakaar ke dhaatuon or phosphorus ke yogicon ko praaia: khanij phosphate kehete hai
 These mineral phosphates are also commonly referred to as rock phosphate or phosphate rock
 kabhi kabhi epetic yaa shail phosphate na kahkar phosphorite kaha jaataa he
 In fact, these three nomenclatures are used for the same mineral, which is found on or below the surface of the earth as the very solid substance of calcium glands with lime rocks
 pehle yaa dharna thi ki inamen jitna bhi phosphate he vah tricalsium phosphate ke rup main vartmaan rahata he, kintu arvachin adhyayanon se yah siddh ho chukaa he ki sabhi prakaar ke phosphate shailon main epetic samooh hi pramukh reeti se upasthit rahata he
 These are the sources of phosphate found in the soil
 iske atirikt ye samudr ke talon main bhi paae jate hai
 It is believed that the largest phosphate deposits of the world originated from the waters of the sea, because these deposits were formed as a result of direct precipitation or beetle of birds, or phosphorus stored by sea-dwelling creatures
 epetic kii paanch kismein gyaat hai jo phosphate ke sthaan par kuch fluoride, chloride, hydraksaide, carbonate yaa sulphate ke pratisthaapan ke falswaroop utpann hoti hai
 Their names are fluor, chlor, hydroxy, carbonate and sulfato-apatite
 fluorine kii upasthiti ke kaaran sphati chattaane jal main nitant aviley hoti hai or isiliye ve yugayagon se chali bhi aa rahi hai
 Titanium, aluminum and iron phosphate are also found in some soils, which are insoluble in water
 epetic main calcium ke saath magnesium, mangneej, straunsium, sisa, sodium, uranium, sirium tathaa anya tatv pratisthaapan dwaara sthaan grahan karke naanaa prakar ke yogicon ko janm de sakate hai
 Not only this, phosphate can also be substituted by vanadate, arsenate, silicate, sulfate, carbonate and oxalate
 prakruti main chah prakaar se epetic paaya ja saktaa he : In addition, the ancient, ashes of agra and phosphatic iron-ore or alkaline clinker are also important sources
 ye khanij phosphate krmanusaar nimnlikhit deshon main adhik paae jate hai : USA, North Africa, Soviet Union, Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean islands and Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Belgium, France and England
 vishwa bhar main phosphotic chattan tathaa epetic kii anumaanit maatra 96,38,11,29,000 ton hogi, jisamen se bharat main keval 1,01,28,000 ton he
 It is clear that this quantity is not enough for a large country like India, but still this quantity is important for the progress of agriculture of this country
 abhi tak bharat main keval do sthanon par phosphate kii khudaai kii jaati he
 The phosphate glands around Trichinapalli have 20-30% phosphorus-pentoxide present and the estimated collection will be 2 million tonnes while the collection near Singhbhumi in Bihar is only 15-20% phosphorus pentoxide and the estimated collection will be 7 lakh tonnes
 
 asthiyon main praaia: tricalsium phosphate ke atirikt sodium, magnesium tathaa carbonate vartmaan rahete hai
 Raw bones contain 2–4% nitrogen, and 22–25% phosphorus pentaoxide
 asthiyon ko ubalkar unamem phospheton kii uplabdhi badhaai ja sakati he
 From every available source in India, 4-5 lakh tons of raw bones can be obtained from animals every year, but the aggregation of more than 1 1 / 2 lakh tons per year is not possible

 This is also known by the name of slag
 isamen 7-8% se lekar 17-20% tak phosphorus pentoxide vartmaan hota hai
 In this way, millions of tons of clinker are prepared in Germany, England and France
 ise thomas phosphate, sinder, phosphate, gandhvihin phosphate yaa kabhi kabhi louh phosphate ke naam se abhihit kiya jaataa he
 It is a cheap and useful phosphate fertilizer for farmers

 Superphosphate is formed when the phosphatic rock is powdered and reacted with sulfuric acid
 is padaarth kaa prayog urvarak ke rup main atyadhik hota he
 Ordinary phosphatic rock powder contains 30–40% phosphorus pentoxide, 3–4% fluorine and varying amounts of lime
 fluorine kii upasthiti ke kaaran chattaanon kaa phosphate paudhon ke liye uplabdh rup main nahin rahata
 Their phosphates are made available by the reaction of acids
 in amlon main salphurik amla, nitric amla tathaa hydrochloric amla pramukh rup se prayukt kiye jate hai
 In India, about 1 1 / 1 lakh tons of superphosphate was distributed in 1957
 phospheti chattaanon se phophoric amla kii bhi prapti kii jaati he, jo nimna kot kii phospheti chattaanon ko trayangi-phosphate banane ke kaam karata he
 Due to the high amount of phosphorus in such phosphates, farmers have to apply small amounts of fertilizer
 phosphate urvarkon kii upyuktata ke liye aavashyak he ki unka phosphorus viley avasthaa main ho
 Phosphatic rock is powdered and used as a phosphorus fertilizer in fields
 yadi carbonic padaartho ke saath is churna ko mitti main choda jaay to paudhon ko adhik phosphorus kii prapti ho sakati he
 The reason for this is that carbon dioxide is formed from organic materials, which dissolve in water and make soluble phosphate
 kshareey dhaatumal kaa phosphate bhi isi prakaar uplabdh kiya jaataa he
 Adding its powder brings special benefits to the grass and roots crops
 amleey mitti main phosphate urvarkon kii atyadhik aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Powder phosphatic rocks are also used in making compost
 america main churna phospheti chattan tathaa england main dhaatumal kaa upyog urvarkon ke rup main safaltaapurvak kiya gaya he
