 The total ownership of a company is divided into millions of crores of pieces
 swaamitv kaa har ek tukdaa ek share hota he
 The more such pieces, the more shares, the greater the stake in the company
 log is hissedari ko kharid-bech bhi sakate hai
 For this, the stock market remains intact
 bharat main bombai stock exange or neshnal stock exange sabase pramukh share bazaar hai
 Often there are two types of shares: ordinary and preferred shares
 saadhaaran share kisi bhi audyogic upkram main niveshak kii aanshik hissedari kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 The common shareholder gets the dividend from the profits of the company he has invested in
 yadi wo company kisi vajah se band ho rahi he to pehle saare hissedaar jaise ki sarkaar, karmchaaree, karjadaata, prifrential shairdharak ko bhugtan kiya jaataa he
 After this, if the amount is left, the common shareholder is paid
 variya share ke naam se hi prathit hota he ki prifrensh shairdharak company kii praathamikta list main aam shairdharakon se upar hota he
 That is, when it comes to payment in case of dividend or closure of the company, preference shareholders are given priority
 paar vailu kisi share kaa anumaanit maan hota he, yani ki wo keemat jo use jari karne vaali company kii balance shit main darj hoti he
 Companies generally have a cross value of Rs 10 or Rs 100
 lekin companiyaan koi bhi paar vailu tay kar sakati hai lekin vah 10 ke gunak yaa ansh main honi chahie jaise ki 13
5
 The company may change the cross value after the initial issue
 koi company paar vailu se adhik mulya ke share jari kar sakati he, jise premium kaha jaataa he, yadi vah sebi ke laabhpradata maandand yaa laabh dein sakane ke paimaane par khari utarati he
 This means that a company will be able to issue fewer shares to raise the required amount and at the same time its dividend liability or dividend liability will be reduced accordingly
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi company ke shares kii paar vailu 50 rupee hai lekin company sebi ke profitability criteria par khari utarati he isliye wo apane sheyaron ko 75 rupee kii keemat par jari kar sakati he
 That is, it can issue at a premium of Rs 25
 yahan ye dhyaan yogya he ki company apana labhaansh yaa dividend share ke paar yaa phase vailu par ghoshit karti he, chaahe wo share kitne bhi premium par jari kyon naa hua ho
 In the case of an initial public offer, companies decide the share price using one of the following three methods: yani phixd price methd ke anusaar jis mulya par share ofer kiye jate hai use company tay kar detii he
 This work is done before the issue opens
 sheyaron kii maang kitni he iskaa pataa company ko tabhi ho paata he jab ishyu band ho jaataa he
 Shares can also be reported at a premium through this method
 is vidhi main niveshak ko ofer kiye share kaa shuddh mulya kaa anumaan nahin ho paata he
 Instead, the company fixes a nominal price range for the stock
 niveshak apni kshamta ke anusaar alag-alag sheyaron ke liye boli lagaate hai
 These bids can be anything within the fixed price range
 sheyaron ke liye ai boli kii maatra ko dekhte hue share kii keemat tay kii jaati he or jitne bhi niveshkon ne iske liye aavedan kiya hota he unhen isi keemat par share die jate hai, chaahe unhone boli main koi or rakam tay kii ho
 It is prevalent in the economic sector that through the book building method one gets a better share price
 oversbskripshan hone par company greenhouse opshan par bhi ja sakati he
 Often, the majority of daters are sold several times over the IPO set limit of good companies, which means they are oversubscribed
 aise main company greenhouse vikalp kaa prayog bhi kar sakati he
 Through this, the company can issue additional shares so that it meets the demand of investors
 haalaanki oversbskripshan ke anupaat ke bare main company ko apane ofer document main pehle se hi bataanaa aavashyak hota he
 Thus, the shares allocated in these three ways get deposited in the demat account of the investor, institution or company
 vyakti kii chalasampatti do prakaar kii hoti he - bhogadhin vastu or vadprapya swawastu 
 Goods are the property that is in your real personal possession, but the claimed object is the property which is not in your immediate possession
 usapar aapkaa adhikaar he jise vaidhanik karrwai dwaara kriyanvit kiya ja saktaa he
 This right is generally attested by an article, for example - by railway receipt
 pramandal main ek ansh bhi vadprapya swawastu he or anshapatr uskaa pramaan he
 But in India, part is considered as goods
 pramandal adhinium 1956 kii dhara 82 kii paribhaasha main kaha gaya he ki pramandal main kisi vyakti kaa ansh yaa anya nihit swaarth 'chal sampatti' mana jayega
 The definition of goods or goods in the Goods Act includes all types of movable property
 isliye pramandal ke ansh keval vadprapya swawastu hi nahin, apitu vastu yaa maal bhi hai
 The true nature of the numerator cannot be explained easily, because the division is completely different from the group of shareholders who make it
 santhaapit pramandal kii anshpunji kaa hona saarvatrik he, yadhyapi anivaary nahin
 It is also equally universal, not mandatory, that capital be divided into fraction of the nominal value
 vah vyakti jiske paas is prakaar kaa ansh he, anshadhari kehalaata he
 Hence each shareholder has a portion of the capital of the division
 lekin vidhik drushti se anshadhari us udhyam yaa kaarkaane kaa aanshik swami nahin he
 Enterprises are somewhat different from the entire capital of the shareholders
 pramandal kii samast parisampatti ukt susangathit santhaan main nihit he, use banane vaale vyaktiyon main nahin
 In terms of legislation, there are certain rights and vested interests of the shareholders as well as some obligations
 anshadhari kaa hit yaa swaarth mahaj chal sampatti se nahin, varan swayan pramandal se hota he
 This selfishness is of a permanent nature
 ansh pramandal main anshadhari kaa vah hit he jo do drushtiyon se dhan kii rakam ke rup main mapa jaataa he, ek to daayitv or labhaansh kii drushti se, duusare byaaj kii drushti se
 And it also includes contracts contained in the Board's Memorandum
 ansh mudra yaa dhan nahin, apitu mudr ke rup main aankaa gaya vah hit he jisamen vibhinn adhikaar or daayitv jude hue hai
 The share is the existing set of rights or entitlements
 udaahranarth, ansh ke kaaran anshadhari pramandal ke laabhon kaa ek samaanupatik bhaag praapt karne, antarniyamon ke aadhaar par pramandal ke kaarobaar main haath bantaane, kaarobaar kii samaapti par sampatti kaa anupatik bhaag paane tathaa sadsyta ke sabhi anya laabhon kaa adhikari ho jaataa he
 There are also some obligations of share
 udaahranarth - pramandal kii parisamapti par purna mulya kii deyta
 All these rights and obligations are a fundamental element of the regular rights and liabilities shares or shares by the Articles of Association

 yah maanate hue ki sanghathan kaa bhinn bhashaaon main bhinn sankshipti banegi, yah tay kiya ki ek sarvyaapee sarvamaanya naam ISO hi chalaaya jaae
 This in itself proves the purpose of this organization
 ISO ke mukhya utpaada hai anterrashtriya maanak
 Only published by ISO are: Technical Reports, Technical Specialization, Publicly Available Specialties, Technical Corrigendum, and and Guide
 anterrashtriya maanak kaa roopakar hota he ISO xxrep 5 n sheershak, jahaan xxrep 5 n he maanak sankhya, xxrep 4 y he prakaashan kaa varsh, evam sheershak bataata he vishay
 yadi maanak sanyukt takneekee samiti JTC1 ke kaary kaa parinaam he, to IEC bhi sammilit kiya jaataa he
 ASTM is also incorporated into standards developed in collaboration with ASTM International
 dinaak evam IS kaa prayog apurna yaa aprakashit maanakon ke liye aprayogneey he, evam kuch paristhitiyon main prakashit kaary kaa sheershak bhi chhona ja saktaa he
 a technical report is issued when a technical committee or subcommittee has generally collected data of a different type from the published international standard, such as references or interpretations
 inaki namakaran pratha maanakon kii bhaanti hi he, keval TR lagaaya jaataa he IS ke sthaan par, report ke naam se pehle
 For example takneekee vishesheekaran ko tab rachit kiya ja saktaa he, jabaki "sambandhit vishay abhi bhi vikaas kii sthiti main hi he, yaa kisi anya karanvash bhavishya main kisi anterrashtriya maanak ko prakashit karne kii sahmati kii sambhaavna hoti he" 
 Publicly available specialties can be an "intermediate specialization that has been published prior to the development of the full international standard", or, a 'bicameral' publication in the IEC, published in collaboration with an external organization
 " Naming is done like a technical report
 udhaahrantah ISO sometimes also issues technical / technical corrigendum

 These are named in the "ISO Guide N: xxrep 4 y : title", eg ISO pralekh prakashnadhikaar surakshit hote hai, evam ISO adhiktar kii pratiyon kaa mulya letaa he

 The fact that many iso-created standards are universal, ubiquitous; On many occasions, the general use of "ISO" has been inspired to describe a product that conforms to the standards
 iske kai udhaaharan hai: To deal with the consequences of abundant coverage in the areas of standardization, and the tasks related to information technology; a Joint Technical Committee constituted from ISO & IEC or International Electrotechnical Commission known as ISO / IEC JTC1

 ek sadsy yaa to bhagidaar yaa prekshak ho saktaa he
 The only difference between the proposed standards and other products is the ability to vote
 kisi sadsy sanstha ke liye kisi yaa prayek up-samiti par str / raay banaae rakhane kii, koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Occasionally, sub-committees may be formed, or even dissolved, to cope with new situations if their area of work is no longer in force
