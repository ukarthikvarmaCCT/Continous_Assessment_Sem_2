 Andromeda Tarapunja The earliest recorded observations were made in 964 BCE by the Persian astronomer, Abad al-rahman al-sufi, who interpreted it as a "small cloud" in his epistemological book
 us samay ke anya tara chitron main ise little cloud ke rup main ankit kiya gaya tha
 The first description of the planet was made in 1612 by German astronomer Simone Marius, based on observations made by binoculars
 charles mesir ne ise 1764 main M31 grah ke rup main soochibaddh kiya or iskaa khojakarta ke rup main shrey galati se marius ko diya gaya, jo sufi al ke pehle kaary se anbhigya the
 In 1785, astronomer William Herschel noted the blurred red color in the core area of M31
 unka maananaa tha ki yah "mahaan nebula" main sabase nikatatam he or nebula ke rang or aakaar ke aadhaar par unhone galat anumaan lagaaya ki yah sirius kii duuri kii tulana main 2000 guna se adhik bada nahin he
 In 1864, William Huggins observed the spectrum of M31 and found it to be different from the gaseous nebula
 M31 ke spectra aavritiyon kii nirantarata ke liye pradarshit gahari avasorana rekhaon kaa nirmaan parat ke rup main karti he jo kisi padaarth ke rasinic mishran kii pahchaan karne main madad karte hai
 The Andromeda Nebula was very similar to the spectra of different stars that originated in which the M31 had a stellar nature
 1885 main, supernova ko pehali baar M31 main dekha gaya, jise is tarapunj main keval ek hi baar dekha gaya
 M31 was thought to be the closest planet at the time, so the object was close to an idea, so this fantasy could not gain much popularity, and this unrelated event was called Nova and named it "nova 1885"

 jiske parinamswaroop us samay surya kii disha 300 kilometres per second main iskaa veg bahut adhik tej record kiya gaya
 In 1917, the American astronomer Heber Curtis saw the Nova in M31
 Searching for photo records, he discovered 11 more novels
 curtis ne dekha he ki un novon kaa ausatan aakaar tarapunj main sthit novon ke aakaar se 10 guna dhundhala tha
 As a result, he could be seen from an estimated 500,000 light years away
 isliye vah tathakthith "dweepiya brahmad" pariklpana prastaavak ban gaya, jo is sarpilaakaar nebula tha vastav main vah swatantra tarapunj tha
 In 1920, a great debate began between Harley Sharpley and Curtis concerning the galaxy, the spiral nebula, and the dimensions of the universe

 In 1922, Ernest Opik presented a very beautiful and simple astronomical method of estimating the distance of M31
 usne hamaare tarapunj ko andromeda se lagbhag 450 kepisi rakhaa, jo lagbhag 1500 keelvai he
 Edwin Hubel began this debate in 1925 when he first identified various cepheid stars beyond the Akash Ganga for an astrophysical image of M31

 However, the rate of star formation in the galaxy is much higher than that of M31 with only one solar body generated per year comparable to that of 3-5 solar bodies
 akashganga main supernove kii dar M31 kii lagbhag doguni he
 It is revealed that M31 may have had a great composition phase in the past but it is quieter than before but the star formation seems to be more active than it is in the galaxy
 kya yah chalata rahegaa, to akashganga kii chamak bhavishya main M31 kii tulana main adhik tej ho sakati he
 Based on its design in visible light, the Andromeda galaxy is classified as sab and the spiral galaxies system as de vécoleurs-sandéz
 However, data from Survey 2MASS showed that the structure of M31 emerged from a box
 Which means that the galaxy is actually seen to be linearly reflected almost as its vertical axis
 2005 main, khagolavidon ne kek telescope kaa upyog yah dikhaane ke liye kiya ki taron kaa timatimaana akashganga ke baahar kii ore badhata jaataa he jo vastav main mukhya discs kaa hi ek hissaa he
 This means that the spiral disk of stars in Andromeda is three times larger than the previous estimate
 nirantar saakshyon se pataa chalata he usamen ek vishaal taarakeey discs he jo akashganga ke vyas ko 220,000 prakaash varsh se adhik badhaati he
 Previously, the size of Andromeda was estimated to be around 70,000 to 120,000 light years

 akashganga kii tiryak kaat ke aakaar kaa vishleshan use samtal discs kii tulana main ek ati spasht, S-aakaar jhukaav ko darshata he
 Possible reasons for such an inclination may be satellite galaxy gravity near M31
 akashganga M33 main M31 ke kaaran kuch jhukaav sambhav he, haalanki yah uski yathavat duuri or trigyakaar vegon par nirbhar karata he
 In the section of the spectroscopy study, different rotational velocity measurements of M31 are explained

 In Andromeda, gas and dust form many annular forms, which form a ring especially with a radius 32,000 light years from its core
 yah valay akashganga ke drishyman prakaash chhaviyon se chipa hua he kyonki yah mukhya rup se thandi dhul se bana dhul se bana he
 On examining the inner region of Andromeda, small particles have been detected in its ring and it is thought that this may have occurred as a result of exposure to M32 200 million years ago

 Its eccentricity is such that the stars are attached to the orbital aposcenter, which increases the orientation of the stars
 P2 main garm varnakrameey varg a taron kii saghan chakrika he
 a star redness filter is unclear but in blue and ultraviolet light they affect the nucleus due to which P2 appears to be more effective than P1
 jabaki, isaki aarambhik khoj ke samay, yah pariklpana kii gai thi ki dabl cendrak kaa chamkila bhaag andromenda ke paas choti akashganga "kenibeliced" kaa shesh bhaag tha, jiske baad uski koi spasht vyakhya nahin kii gai
 The basic reason for this is that this type of nucleus has a very short lifetime due to the fluctuating disruption of the central black hole
 jabaki iskaa aanshik rup se samdhaan sambhav he yadi P1 ke paas uskaa apana sthir karne vaala blike hole ho P1 main uthal-puthal kaa matlab yah nahin he ki uske centre main blike hole he

 fixed by making necessary changes in its internal environment
 tantra - do prakaar ke ho sakate hai - khulaa yaa band 
 In relation to systems with parameters, an organism may be a regulator or conformer
 On the one hand, regulators try to maintain the parameter at a constant level, possibly over wide ambient environmental changes
 On the other hand, conformers allow environment parameters to be determined

 The components for all homeostatic control systems being regulated are interdependent variables
 At least three receptor environments have sensing components that monitor and respond to changes
 When the senses a receptor stimulus, it sends information to a control center, the component that is set on the boundary which is a variable

 Only small, isolated habitats known as ecological phenomena can be observed on the island
 One such case study followed the major eruption in the Krakata Island 1883 of the last wilderness climax: the established stable homeostasis was destroyed and all life was wiped out from the island
 In the years following the eruption, Krakata went through an ecological sequence of changes after which successive groups of new species, or plants, grow into each other leading to biodiversity and ultimately culminating in a re-climax of the community
 Established
 This ecological succession occurred in a number of stages on Krakata, a sequence of stages in a seré defined as one "events by which succession occurs"
 The series of seris leading a climax is called the complete prisere one

 Zamindari system was a political-social practice prevalent in India during the Mughal era and the British period in which the land was owned by someone else rather than by the people who collected taxes from the cultivators

 According to the ancient ideology of India, land was public property, so it could not be the property of the person

 According to Maharishi Jaimini, "the king could not surrender the land because it is not his property but the combined property of human society

 Manu also has a clear statement that "according to the rishis, the first right to own land is the one who plowed the forest and cleaned it"

 The main question is that who had the right to own land - the state, the peasant or any middle class, according to the opinion of the scholars, this right was the right in ancient India, which cannot be called the right of self

 But even in this crisis, the rights of the farmers were not fully surrendered
 bharat main angrejon ke aagamankaal se hi jameendaari pratha kaa udai hone laga
 The British rulers believed that they were the owners of the land and the farmers were their subjects, so they made permanent and temporary arrangements with big farmers and kings and landlords
 yadhyapi raajnneetik auchity se prabhavit hokar usne ek ek pargana har kar vasuul karanevaale ijaaredaar ko paanch varsh ke liye patte par de diya
 Thus, the Zamindari system was recognized by the British, although initially it was not their idea to deprive the peasants of their rights, Lord Corn Wallis became the Governor General in 1786, after Warren Hastigze

 The zamindari system emerged in Madras through the auction policy of the British rulers
 gaanvon kii bhoomi kaa vibhaajan kar unhen nilaam kar diya jaataa tha or adhiktam mulya denevaale ko vikray kar diya jaataa tha
 Initially, the settlement in Awadh was done by the cultivator but later it was settled with the landlords due to political reasons

 This is the simplest way to collect unjust amount of money and it is also useful from the point of view of politics because as a result, a powerful and rich section of the government will continue to get help
 is prakaar bharatvarsh ke itihaas main sarvapratham in bandobaston dwaara rajya or krishakon ke bich main jameendaaron kaa varg angrejon kii niti dwaara sthapit hua jiske fal swaroop krishakon ke bhu-sampatti adhikaar, jo anadi kaal se chale aa rahe the, chhin gaye
 This intermediate class became wealthier day by day as the British rulers continued to give more and more of their money as a bait
 in bandobaston main krishakon ke hiton kii ore koi dhyaan nahin diya gaya tha jiske parinamswaroop unka du:kha, apmaan evam daridray din pratidin badhata gaya
 Many times the British rulers also pointed out that the land tenure of the farmers should be protected and their rent should be fixed till the time of settlement
 phir bhi kuch nahin kiya gaya
 The reason for this was that the British rulers believed that when they would be prosperous and satisfied in showing leniency in dealing with the zamindars, they would not persecute their assassins, as a result of which they would also be happy
 parantu yah unki mahaan bhul thi kyonki jameendaaron ne hameshaa hi apane kartavya ke saath vishwasghaat kiya
 Therefore, the British rulers felt that this mistake should be rectified
 falswaroop unhone krishakon kii dasha sudhaarney ke liye bhoomi sambandhi vidhaanon kii vyavastha kii
 This step can be called the first step towards the end of Zamindari system

 But the main purpose of these laws was to facilitate the zamindars in collecting the revenue so that they can give revenue to the state at the right time
 san 1859 i0 main bhoomi sambandhi pehla adhinium paas hua
 This Act was an ideal land-act for all British India, according to which the Act passed in all parts of India and amendments were made from time to time to pacify the disgruntled farmers

 The second phase of the Zamindari system took place from 1930 AD to 1944 AD
 is samay main saare desh main kisaan andolan hone lage
 The seed of these movements was sown by a Kisan Sabha which took place on 11 February 1918 in Allahabad meeting of All India Congress

 As a result, there was a lot of awareness among the rural masses

 Influenced by the peasant movements, new Acts were enacted in the Raiyatwadi areas to protect the interests of the farmers

 Therefore, the Indian National Congress has several times announced that the abolition of Zamindari should give a prominent place in the Congress program
 ek kisaan conference taarikh 27,28 april san 1935 i0 ko sardaar patel ke sabhapatitv main elahabaad main hui thi
 He took a major step towards this by passing the proposal for the abolition of Zamindari, in this proposal it was declared that 'the present Zamindari system is completely opposite from the view of Gramakalyan
 yah pratha british shashan ke aagaman main laai gai or isse gramin jivan purnataya tahas nahas ho gaya he’
 But as World War II started in 1939, the entire program of land reform was halted
 yuddh kii samaapti ke baad jameendaari pratha ke ant kaa antim charan aarambh hua jo san 1945 se 1955 tak chalaa
 At the end of the war, the British government decided to elect provincial houses in 1945 under the Government of India Act 1935
 congress ne chunaav main bhaag lene kaa nishchay kiya or disambar 1945 main chunaav ghoshnaptr nikaala
 In this manifesto, regarding the abolition of Zamindari, it was clearly stated that 'the improvement of the land system, which is most needed in India, is related to the removal of the middle class between the farmers and the state
 isliye is madhyavarti varg ke adhikaron kaa uchit pratikar dekar praapt kar liya janaa chahie’
 Economists, politicians and journalists all agreed with this manifesto
 jameendaari pratha bhartiya aarthik vikaas main rukawat daalati thi kyonki bade jameendaar hameshaa pratikriyavaad ke samarthak the
 The 'london Economist' wrote about them that 'most of these' Thackerseys' characters were as lame as' Lord Stein ', lazy like' Jane Austen '' Mr
 Bennet ',' Surtijsquire 'drunk
 bengal land kamishan bhi is nishkarsh par pahunchaa ki ‘san 1793 i0 kaa sthaayee bandobast us samay jin bhi kaarnon se uchit samajha gaya ho, aaj kii paristhiti main anupyukt he or jameendaari pratha main itani buraaiyaan upaj chuki he ki yah ab raashtra ke hit main kisi bhi prakaar upyogi nahin rah gai he
 'in the opinion of Indian and Western economists, the abolition of zamindari is necessary for more agricultural production
 iske atirikt yah pratha sansar ke har bhaag main samyaanukool na hone ke kaaran samaapt ho chuki he
 PS, this practice is more expensive for the state
 sarvopari, yah pratha is samay aisi sthiti par pahunch chuki thi ki yadi iskaa unmoolan na kiya gaya hota to iske kaaran ne keval rashtriya aarthik samasya par hi varan samaaj suraksha par bhi vipatti aa padati
 Therefore, as a result of the success of elections in 1946, when the Congress cabinet was formed in every province, a bill was introduced to abolish the Zamindari system according to the election pledge
 ye vidheyak san 1950 i0 se 1955 i0 tak adhinium banakar chaalu ho gaye jinke parinamswaroop jameendaari pratha kaa bharat main unmoolan ho gaya or krishakon evam rajya ke bich pun: sidhaa sambandh sthapit ho gaya
 The landowners now got back to the farmers which they had been using since time immemorial
 is prakaar jis jameendaari pratha kaa udai hamaare desh main angrejon ke aagaman se hua tha uskaa ant bhi unke shashan ke samaapt hote hi ho gaya
 At the end of this practice, no one mourned at all, because the old theory, according to which the owner of the land used to be an agriculturist, recurred as soon as it was destroyed

 One day, coming from the palace towards the hut, he saw an antelope
 mrug adbhut tha or aisa mrug vikram ne kabhi nahin dekha tha
 He took the bow in his hand and put the other hand in the quiver, that the antelope came near him and started begging for his life in human speech
 vikram ko us mrug ko manushyon kii tarah bolte hue dekh bada aashcharya hua or unka haath swat: tham gaya
 Vikram asked the deer how he speaks like humans, and he said that all this has happened due to the effect of his philosophy
 vikram kii jigyaasa ab or bad gai
 He asked the antelope why he started telling them why
 "main janmajaat mrug nahin hoon
 i was born to a king in the human family
 anya rajkumaron kii bhanti mujhe bhi shikaar khilne kaa bahut shauk tha
 For hunting, i used to venture far into the deep forests on my horse
 ek din mujhe kuch duuri par mrug hone kaa abhas hua or maine awaz ko lakshya karke ek wan chalaaya
 Actually that voice was that of a mean yogi who was chanting very slowly
 tir use to nahin laga, par uski canapati ko choota hua puro veg se ek vriksh ke tane main ghus gaya
 When i reached there in search of my prey, i came to know how i was saved from being evil
 yogi kii sadhana main vighn padaa tha
 So he was very angry
 usne jab mujhe apane saamne khadaa paaya to samaj gaya ki vah wan maine chalaaya tha
 He cursed me, staring with red eyes
 usne kaha- "o mrug kaa shikaar pasand karne vaale murkh yuvak, aaj se khud mrug ban ja
 From today onwards, he kept protecting his life from hunting
 " He cursed so quickly that i did not get a chance to say anything in my cleanliness
 shraap kii kalpana se hi main bhay se sihar uthaa
 i fell at the feet of the yogi and started praying for his curse
 maine ro-ro kar usase kaha ki uski sadhana main vighn utpann karne kaa meraa koi iraadaa nahin tha or yah sab anjaane main mujhase ho gaya
 Seeing tears of remorse in my eyes, that yogi felt pity
 usne mujhase kaha ki shraap waapas to nahin liya ja saktaa, lekin vah us shraap ke prabhaav ko simit zaroor kar saktaa he
 i said that as much as possible he reduces the effect of curse, then he said- "you will continue to wander as an antelope until the great King Vikramaditya is seen
 vikramaditya ke darshan se hi tum manushyon kii bhanti bolnaa shuru kar doge
 " vikram ko ab jigyaasa hui ki vah manushyon kii bhanti bol to rahaa he magar manushya main parivartit nahin hua he
 They asked him- "when will you get freedom from the antelope? When will you attain your real form? vah shraapit rajkumaar bolaa- "isse bhi mujhe mukti bahut sheeghra mil jaaegi
 According to the statement of that yogi, if i take you with him and go to him, i will get my real form back soon
 " Vikram was happy that the cursed prince was not killed by his hand, otherwise he would have committed the sin of killing a innocent man and would be burning in the fire of guilt and remorse
 unhone mrigarupi rajkumaar se poocha- "kya tumhen us yogi ke nivas ke bare main kuch pataa he? kya tum mujhe uske paas lekar chal sakate ho?" The prince said- "yes, i can walk you till his hut
 sanyog se vah yogi abhi bhi isi jangal main thodi dur par sadhana kar rahaa he
 " vah mrug aage-aage chalaa or vikram uskaa anusaran karte-karte chalate rahe
 After walking a little distance, he saw a yogi doing a sadhana on a tree
 unki samaj main aa gaya ki rajkumaar isi yogi kii baat kar rahaa tha
 When he came close, the yogi saw him and got down from the tree and stood upright
 usne vikram kaa abhivadan kiya tathaa darshan dene ke liye unhen natmastak hokar dhanyavad diya
 Vikram understood that the yogi was waiting for him
 lekin unhen jigyaasa hui ki vah unki pratiksha kyon kar rahaa tha
 On asking, he told him that one day Indra Dev appeared to him in the dream and said that Maharaja Vikramaditya has acquired a place like deities by his deeds and that the one who got his darshan received the fruits of the darshan of Indra Deva or other deities
 it happens
 "main itani kathin sadhana sirf aapke darshan kaa laabh paane ke liye kar rahaa tha
 "- said the yogi
 vikram ne poocha ki ab to usne unke darshan praapt kar liye, kya unase vah kuch or chahta he
 At this, the yogi asked him the rosary of Indra Dev's coral lying on his neck
 raja ne khushi-khushi vah maala use de di
 Yogi thanked him that the cursed prince became human again
 usne pehle vikram ke phir us yogi ke paanv chhue
 Vikram came to his palace with the prince
 duusare din apane rath par use bitha uske rajya chal die
 But as soon as he entered the kingdom, a troop of soldiers surrounded his chariot and asked his purpose to enter the kingdom
 rajkumaar ne apana parichay diya or rasta chhodane ko kaha
 He wanted to know how the soldiers dared to stop his chariot
 sainikon ne use bataaya ki uske mata-pita ko bandi banaakar karagaar main daal diya gaya he or ab is rajya par kisi or kaa adhikaar ho chukaa he
 Since the prince did not know anything while taking over the kingdom, spies were spread around in search of him
 ab uske khud haazir hone se nae shaasha kaa maarg or prashast ho gaya he
 King Vikramaditya did not introduce himself and introduced himself as the prince's messenger and asked that a message be sent to the new ruler
 unhone us tukdi ke nayak ko kaha ki naye shaasha ke saamne do vikalp hai- yaa to vah asli raja or rani ko unka rajya saunpkar chalaa jaae yaa yuddh kii taiyaari kare
 That commander felt very strange
 usne vikram kaa uphaas karte hue poocha ki yuddh koun karegaa
 Will both of them fight
 usko uphaas karte dekh unka krodh saantven aasmaan par pahunch gaya
 He took out the sword and severed it from the head
 sena main bhagdad much gai
 Someone ran and informed the new ruler
 vah turant sena lekar unki ore dauda
 Vikram was ready for this attack
 unhone donon betaalon kaa samaran kiya tathaa betaalon ne unka aadesh paakar rath ko hawa main uth liya
 He applied the tilak which could be invisible and jumped from the chariot
 adrishy rahakar unhone dushmano ko gaajar-muuli kii tarah kaatna shuru kar diya
 When hundreds of soldiers were killed and the enemy could not be seen, there was a stampede among the soldiers and most of the soldiers fled the battlefield leaving the king there
 unhen laga ki koi pashachik shakti unka muqaabala kar rahi he
 The face of the new ruler was worth seeing
 vah aashcharyachakit or bhaybheet tha hi, hataash bhi dikh rahaa tha
 Seeing his surprise, Vikram put his sword on his neck and came in his real form
 unhone us shaasha se apana parichay dete hue kaha ki yaa to vah isi kshan yah rajya chhodkar bhaag jaae yaa praan dand ke liye taiyaar rahe
 He was aware of the power of the ruler Vikramaditya and saw his valor with his eyes, so he fled that kingdom at that very moment
 vaastavik raja-rani ko unka rajya waapas dilaakar ve apane rajya kii ore chal pade
 There was a forest on the way
 us jangal main ek mrug unke paas aayaa tathaa ek singh se apane ko bachaane ko bolaa
 But Maharaja Vikramaditya did not help him
 ve bhagwaan ke banaae niyam ke viruddh nahin ja sakate the
 The lion was hungry and only animals like antelope could calm his apps
 yah sochate hue unhone sihan ko mrug kaa shikaar karne diya

 When the trial of Gandhian slaughter took place in the court, Madanlal Pahwa admitted in it that whoever was involved in this conspiracy, according to the earlier plan, had to act only by throwing bombs and to spread the disturbance in the assembly, the rest was the responsibility of others
 jab use choturam ne jane se roka to usne jaise bhi usase ban paaya apana kaam kar diya

 The man may have learned and learned the art of playing and playing, but he must have started singing and dancing not only thousands of years but millions of years ago, no doubt
 gaan maanav ke liye praaia: utana hi swaabhaavik he jitna bhaashan
 Since when man started singing, it is as difficult to tell when he started speaking

 Where there was no song in the instrument, there were only dry characters like Dada, Diddid, where it was called 'nirgit' or 'bahirgit' and there was a different art of dance or dance
 kintu dhire-dhire gaan, vaadya or nrity teenon kaa "sangeet" main antarbhaav ho gaya - geetan vaadyan tathaa nrityan trayan sangatmuchyate
 Other countries outside India only count songs and instruments in music; Dance is considered a different art
 bharat main bhi nrity ko sangeet main keval isliye gin liya gaya ki uske saath baraabar geet yaa vaadya athwa donon rahete hai
 It has been written above that the art of vocal and rhythm is called music
 swar or lay geet or vaadya donon main milte hai, kintu nrity main lay maatr he, swar nahin
 We will only discuss song and instrument within music, because music is also used in other countries in the same sense
 sangeet kaa aadim strot prakritik dhvaniyaan hi he
 In the pre-music era, humans tried to understand the sounds of nature and their specific rhythms
 har tarah kii prakritik dhvaniyaan sangeet kaa aadhaar nahin ho saktin, at: bhav paidaa karne vaali dhvaniyon ko parakhkar sangeet kaa aadhaar banane ke saath-saath unhen lay main baandhane kaa prayaas kiya gaya hoga
 The sounds of nature that touched the hearts and minds of humans and made them hilarious, became the instruments of music with the development of civilization

 Philosophers considered Madhyama as the basis of musical utterance from among the four parts of Nad, Para, Pashyanti, Madhyama and Vaikhari
 darwin ne kaha ki pashu rati ke samay madhur dhwani karte hai
 When humans started imitating this type of sound, music emerged
 ’’ karl stamph ne bhashaa utpatti ke baad manushya dwaara dhwani kii ektarata ko swar kii utpatti mana
 In the latter half of the nineteenth century, Bharatendu Harishchandra said that "music originated with human compassion
 ’’ unhone sangeet ko gane, bajaane, bataane or naachne kaa samucchy bataaya
 There are many interesting stories about the origin of music in oriental scriptures
 devraj indra kii sabha main gayak, vadak va nartak hua karte the
 Gandharva used to sing, Apsaras danced and Kinnars played instruments
 gandharv-kala main geet sabase pradhan rahaa he
 There was an anthem in the beginning, the construction of the instrument came back
 geet kii pradhanta rahi
 This is the reason that no matter what the song is, the name of the instrument is music
 peeche se nrity kaa bhi isamen antarbhaav ho gaya
 In the Aryan languages of the world, the word music is found well in the meaning of songs
 'sangeet' shabd ‘sam+gr’ dhaatu se bana he

 In Arabic there is the word 'gana' which is completely matching with 'gana'

 The word 'muse' in the dictionary means 'the inspiring Gods of Song' meaning 'the goddess of the song'

 Mysore Narasimhachar Srinivas was a renowned sociologist of India
 unhone dakshin bharat main jati tathaa jati pratha, saamaajik starikaran, saanskritikaran tathaa pashchimikaran par kaary kiya
 They presented the concept of 'dominant caste'
 'mysore narsinhachaar shrinivas' ko san 1977 main bharat sarkaar dwaara vigyaan evam abhiyantriki ke kshetra main padam bhushan se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 They are from Karnataka
 aupchaarik rup se bhartiya samajashaastra ke aadi-purush bhale hi na hon, lekin swatantra bharat main is anushaasan ko unhone apane saidhantik yogadan, jati kii vilakshan samaj or sahabhaagi prekshan kii paddati ke istemaal se jitna samrudh kiya he vah unhen desh ke shirshatam samaaj-vigyaniyon main shaamil karne ke liye paryaapt he
 In sociology, he is known for his original foundations like Sanskritisation, dominant caste and vote bank
 shrinivas sansthaaon ke nirmaataa bhi the
 He is credited for the establishment of departments of sociology in Baroda and Delhi University
 shodh or adhyayan ke ucchstareey sansthaanon kii sthapana or disha-nirdesan ke lihaaz se bhi bhartiya samajashaastra ke vikaas main unka yogadan kaaljayi mana jayega
 Apart from a specific study of rural community and caste structure, M
N
 Srinivas has also done thought provoking work on topics such as social impact of science, Gandhi's religious thinking, history of anthropology and gender
 shrinivas kaa krititv vastunishth paryvekshan, vishleshan kii maheentaon tathaa saidhantik gaharaai kaa durlabh sangam mana jaataa he
 His writing provides a particular ground context for inter-subjectivity
 shrinivas kii samajashastreey drushti ghatnaon kii bahari banaavat ko bhed kar unhen gadhane vaali sanrachanaon or aitihaasik shaktiyon kii thaah leti he
 His ability to present the nuanced details and insights of community life in simple language gives him a distinct personality from contemporary sociologists
 is arth main ve vishaygat shabdaawalee kaa atikaraman karte hue saadhaaran or prachlit bhashaa ko chunate hai
 It will be called the democracies of his scholarship that his theoretical concepts help in understanding the subject rather than engaging in his own ideas
 shrinivas ne vicharadhara ke str par bhartiya samajashaastra ke liye ek nayi zamin taiyaar kii
 It is worth mentioning that at the time when Srinivas was preparing to study Indian society, American and British academic installations dominated social sciences
 america vishvavidhyalayon main prachlit drushtikon bhartiya upmahadweep ke samaaj ko samajhane ke liye sanskritnishtha paramparaon par jor detaa tha
 As a result, Indian sociologists considered Sanskrit sources and Indology / Indology to be more authentic for the study of contemporary reality
 shrinivas pehle samajashastri the jinhone is varchasvkaari sthiti ko chunauti di
 He proved from his writings that in sociology, the study of the actual activities and activities of society is better than relying on classical references
 shrinivas dwaara prastut prabhutvshaalee jati tathaa samskruthikaran kii avadharanaon kaa raajnneeti vigyaniyon ke alaava itihaas-lekhan kii sabaltern jaisi dhaaraon ke itihaaskaaron ne vyapak prayog kiya gaya he
 In this sense, his work can be placed in the category of an intellectual tradition which has acquired the status of an important reference for new and old scholars
 prasangvash, prabhutvshaalee jati kii avadharana sankhya bal, bhu-swaamitv, shiksha or naukari jaise karkon ke kaaran kisi jati ke gaanv yaa kshetra vishesh main dabadabe ko jaahir karti he to samskruthikaran nimna jatiyon dwaara ucch jatiyon khaas taur par brahman varg kii samskruti, reeti-rivaazon, bhashaa or veshbhusha aadi ko apnaane kii pravriti ko gyaapit karti he
 Though his third concept vote bank could not make a permanent place in social sciences, the term is used indiscriminately in the daily discourse of politics and media world
 swatantra bharat kii raajnneetik or saamaajik sanrachana ke adhyayan main ye teenon avadharanaayen or usase jude vimarsh tattvik mahatva hasil kar chuke hai
 The concepts of dominant caste and culturalization help in understanding the decisive elements of India's social system and its organizational structure
 haalaanki brahmnavaadi aadarshon kii ghatati vaidhata ke kaaran samskruthikaran kii avadharana ab utani mahatvapurn nahin maani jaati lekin yah tathy he ki beesvin sadi ke ek bade kalkhand or swatantraaa ke baad bhi lambe samay tak samskruthikaran ek kaasi ullekhneey pravriti thi
 In the politics that emerged after the Dalit movement and the Mandal Commission, the trend of Sanskritisation has weakened, but the concept of dominant caste is still seen as an essential tool in analyzing the political processes in rural society in India
 kai samakaleen samajashastri shrinivas ke krititv ko rashtravaadi samajashaastra ke brihattar sandarbh main rakhkar aankane kaa aagrah karte rahe hai
 He says that the urban elite of independent India wanted to continue the project of modernization of colonial rule
 isliye rashtravaadi samajashastriyon ke krititv main chintan or vichaar kii vahi aupniveshik saraniyan sakriy thi jinke aadhaar par british satta apane shashan ko vaid tehraati aayi thi
 These scholars say that the work of sociologists like Srinivas focused on caste and community provides a benchmark for understanding of an all-india Sanskritist Hinduism
 lekin shrinivas kii drushti ko prakat yaa aprakat taur par british yaa america maanavshaastra kii sthapanaaon se nirdeshit bataanaa jaldbaaji kii daleel he jo subooton kii kami ke baavjood aarope patr taiyaar karne kii himakat karti he
 This argument fails to target the tendency of Srinivasa's work in which Srinivas studies the community and also considers the duality of the community and its relations
 shrinivas samajashaastra or maanavshaastra kii buniyadi prasthaapanaaon par bhi thik isi tarah vichaar karte hai
 It is worth noting that Srinivas defines himself as a fellow scholar, as a fellow scholar, whose identity is not different from his subject ie people
 shrinivas jin logon yaa samudaay kaa adhyayan karte the unhen ve anya kii shrenee main nahin rakhte the
 In this regard, many British anthropologists have believed that anthropologists studying their society face different kinds of difficulties
 unke anusaar viksit desh kaa maanavshastri ek deshaj maanavshastri ko uski nimnatar sthiti kii ore ishaara karke hameshaa ek khaas saanche main kaid rakhana chahta he
 Srinivas, while clarifying the position of the indigenous anthropologist on this issue, wrote that when an Indian anthropologist studies any caste or other group of India, that caste or group is other for him but at the same time does not ignore this
 It should be done that certain cultural forms, beliefs and values of that caste or group also match the said scholar
 yani aisi sthiti main bhartiya maanavshastri asal main ek tarah se anya main swa kaa bhi adhyayan karata he
 In this sense, that caste or group is not completely unfamiliar to him or her as both are connected to the same culture
 shrinivas is sthiti ko asaamaanya dhang se jatil, bahuparti or dwaidhapurna maanate hai
 Looking carefully, Srinivas does not seem to be accused of being a nationalist sociologist given the points of difference and equality with his subject
 vastav main shrinivas is baat par jor dete hai ki adhyayan main aatm or anya kii yah bahulata maanavshastri ke apane samudaay kaa sadsy hone yaa bahari hone kii ekalata se kahin zyaada shreyaskar he
 It is noteworthy that he uses many observations from the Chicago School to study the caste system of the village of Rampura, which was chosen by Srinivas for his research studies
 varna kii prak-british avadharana ko shrinivas kitaabi nazariyaa siddh karte hue yah kehete hai ki yah drushti jati ke gatisheel pakshon ko gaun kar detii he
 Although Srinivas's caste-study focused on the local structure of a village, he was also conscious of the pan-india prevalence of this phenomenon
 apane ek lekh main ve is tathy kii ore ishaara karte hai ki jati nihsandeh ek akhil bhartiya sanrachana he, kyonki desh main har jagah aise samooh dekhe ja sakate hai jo paitrukataa tathaa vaivaahik sambandhon ke aadhaar par ek vishisht samooh kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Srinivas also cites traditional employment of these groups in this regard
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki desh main har jagah brahman, achhut, kisaan, dastkaar, vyapaaree or dusron kii seva karne vaali jatiyon kaa astitv dekha ja saktaa he
 In this caste study, Srinivas also mentions regional variations and factors such as western education, administrative jobs, city income, which have had a major impact on the caste structure
 is tarah deergh avadhi ke lihaaj se dekhen to ek samajashastri ke taur par shrinivas ne bhartiya gram or jati kii sanrachana ko aupniveshik dharanaon ke saidhantik varchasv se bhi mukt karaayaa he
 At the same time, he also countered the beliefs of sociologists like Dumon who were proposing that caste differences do not allow the Indian village to become a community
 shrinivas jab gramin samudaay kii sankalpana or gaanvon kii aarthik-saanskrithik antar-nirbharta kii baat karte hai to ve avyakt dhang se akhil bhartiya sabhyataa kii baat bhi karte hai
 Some scholars believe that Srinivas has adopted a Brahminical or upper caste point of view in the study of caste
 lekin is daleel ko sahi kone se dekhen to vah darasal aupniveshik samajashaastra se nikali prathit hoti he
 Srinivas's logic-plan actually exposes the macro and under-concerned perceptions of Western sociologists regarding India's rural communities
 sankshep main kaha jaae to shrinivas kaa krititv pashchimi gyanshastreey prasthaapanaaon, swa, samudaay tathaa raashtra kii dharanaon ke aalochakeey vimarsh main kai buniyadi tark muhaiyaa karaata he

 The practice of Indian sociology is incomplete without the study of his works
 unke anusandhan or pustakon ne kaii anya samajashastriyon ko prerit kiya he
 To understand Indian society and culture, it is mandatory to practice the books and research conducted by MN Srinivas

 With the publication of the book, there was a stir in India and western countries because it found a description of the wonderful elements of governance in which Indians were considered completely ignorant

 Kautilya's 'arthashastra' is an important work of political principles
 is sambandh main yah prashn uthta he ki kautilya ne apni pustak kaa naam 'arthshaastra' kyon rakhaa? prachinkaal main 'arthshaastra' shabd kaa prayog ek vyapak arth main hota tha
 Under this, the study of political science, theology, economics, law etc
 was originally done
 acharya kautilya kii drushti main raajnneeti shaastra ek swatantra shaastra he or anvikshiki, trayee tathaa vaarta env kanoon aadi uski shakhaayen hai
 The entire society is protected by politics or penal system or only the protected subjects can follow their duties
 us samay arthshaastra ko raajnneeti or prashasan kaa shaastra mana jaataa tha
 There is a context in this connection in the Mahabharata, in which Arjuna is considered an expert on economics
 nishchit rup se kautilya kaa arthshaastra bhi rajshastra ke rup main liya gaya hoga, yon usne arth kii kai vyakhyaayein kii hai
 Kautilya has said - Manushayanam vritirartha, that is to say, the meaning of the livelihood of human beings
 arthshaastra kii vyakhya karte hue usne kaha he—tasya pruthivya laabhpalnopaayah shaastramarth-shastramiti
 Thus, it is also clear that 'economics' includes principles related to both the polity and the economy
 vastutah kautilya 'arthshaastra' ko keval rajvyavastha or arthvyavastha kaa shaastra kahana upyukt nahin hoga
 In fact, it is the scripture related to economy, state, law, social system and religious system
 kautilya ke 'arthshaastra' ke purv or bhi kai arthshaastron kii rachana kii gayi thi, yadhyapi unki pandulipiyaan uplabdh nahin hai
 In India, since ancient times, efforts have been made for the combination and combination of meaning, work and religion and for this there are detailed discussions in the scriptures, memories and Puranas
 kautilya ne bhi 'arthshaastra' main arth, kaam or dharm kii prapti ke upayon kii vyakhya kii he
 In the 'kamasutra' of Vatsyayan, sources have been composed in relation to the meaning, religion and work
 apane purv arthshaastron kii rachana kii baat swayan kautilya ne bhi sweekaar kiya he
 In his 'arthashastra' he has mentioned Acharya Vrihaspati, Bharadwaja, Shukracharya, Parashar, Pishun, Vishalaksha etc
 in many references
 kautilya ke purv anek aacharyon ke granthon kaa namakaran dandniti ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 It seems that Kautilya's earlier scriptures were called Dandaniti and were similar to Arthashastra
 parantu jaisaa ki anek vidwaanon ne sweekaar kiya he ki dandniti or arthshaastra donon samroop nahin hai
 U
 N
 According to Ghoshal's statement, Arthashastra is a more comprehensive scripture, whereas Dandaniti is only its branch
 kautilya ke paashchaat likhe gayi shaastra 'nitishastra' ke naam se vikhyath hue, jaise kaamandak nitisar
 By the way, many scholars have considered economics more comprehensive than ethics
 parantu, adhikansh vidwaanon kii raay main nitishastra or arthshaastra donon samroop hai tathaa donon ke vishay kshetra bhi ek hi hai
 Kamandaka himself has considered ethics and economics to be identical
 uparyukt vivechan se yah spasht he ki kautilya ke 'arthshaastra' ke purv or uske baad bhi 'arthshaastra' jaise shastron kii rachana kii gayi
 In this regard, there are a large number of scholars who believe that Kautilya was not the creator of 'arthashastra'
 aise vidwaanon main paashchaatya vidwaanon kii sankhya zyada he
 Stan, Jolly, Winterneese and Keith are exponents of this type of thought

 bhandarkar ne bhi iskaa samarthan kiya he
 Bhandarkar has said that Patanjali did not mention Kautilya in the Mahabhashya
 'arthshaastra' ke rachayita ke rup main kautilya ko nahin manyata denevaalon ne apane mat ke samarthan main nimnlikhit tark prastut kiye hai— It is clearly written at the end of the book- saath hi yah bhi likhaa gaya he: This incident is discussed in Vishnu Purana as follows: ‘nitisar’ ke karta kaamandak ne bhi ghatana kii pushti karte hue likhaa he: It is clear from these quotes that Vishnugupta and Kautilya were the same person
 ‘arthshaastra’ main hi dwitiya adhikaran ke dasham adhyay ke ant main pustak ke rachayita kaa naam ‘kautilya’ bataaya gaya he: By writing 'kautilyan Kritam Shastra' at the beginning of the book and 'iti Kautiliyearthastra' at the end of each chapter, the author has made his' Kautilya name more famous
 jahaan-jahaan anya aacharyon ke mat kaa pratipaadan kiya he, ant main ‘iti kautilya’ arthath kautilya kaa mat he-is tarah kahkar kautilya naam ke liye apana adhik pakshpaat pradarshit kiya he
 But it is absolutely undisputed that Vishnugupta and Kautilya were integral persons
 uttarkalin dandi kavi ne ise acharya vishnugupt naam se yadi kaha he, to banbhatta ne ise hi kautilya naam se pukaara he
 The statement of both is that this Acharya composed 'dandaniti' or 'arthashastra'
 panchatantra main isi acharya kaa naam chanakya diya gaya he, jo arthshaastra kaa rachayita he
 In the poet visakhadatta-praneeth well-known drama Mudrarakshas, chanakya is sometimes referred to as Kautilya and sometimes Vishnugupta
 ‘arthshaastra’ kii rachana ‘shashan-vidhi’ ke rup main pratham maury samraat chandragupta ke liye kii gai
 Therefore, it is appropriate to consider the period of its creation as the period of the emperor Chandragupta

 As stated above, its main subject is governance-law or governance-science: "kautilyan Narendrathe's rule of law: Krita"
 ’’ in shabdon se spasht he ki acharya ne isaki rachana raajnneeti-shaastra tathaa visheshtya shashan-prabandh kii vidhi ke rup main kii
 Seeing the table of contents of economics, it is well proved that it is a mistake to call it the book of economics nowadays
 pratham adhikaran ke prarambh main hi swayan acharya ne ise 'dandniti' naam se suchit kiya he
 Shukracharya has described Dandaniti as such an important discipline that it has assumed the presence of all other disciplines - because according to the dictation of 'shastren Rakshe Deshe Shastraschhinta Pravartate', there can be concern or practice of other scriptures in the country, well protected and protected by weapons
 is
 at: dandniti ko anya sab vidyaon kii aadharbhoot vidya ke rup main sweekaar karnaa aavashyak he or vahi dandniti arthshaastra he
 The term 'dialogue' has been used for what is now called economics, although the term is not entirely indicative of economics
 kautilya ne vaarta ke teen ang kahe hai - krishi, vaanijya tathaa pashu-paalan, jinase praaia: vritti yaa jeevika kaa uparjan kiya jaataa tha
 The scholars of Manu, Yajnavalkya etc
 have also accepted the dialogue of these three parts
 peeche shukracharya ne is vaarta main kuseed ko bhi vritti ke saadhan-rup main sammilit kar diya he
 But economics has been described by all the scholars as politics, politics or governance
 at: ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ ko raajnneeti kii pustak samajhnaa hi thik hoga na ki sampattishastra kii pustak
 By the way, in some cases, the relevant topics of wealth creation, wealth and wealth exchange, wealth division etc
 have also been discussed
 ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ ke pratham adhikaran kaa praarambhik vachan is sambandh main adhik prakaash daalane vaala he: That is, this one economics has been created by taking the summary of all the economics which the ancient masters have written to win the earth and show the ways of rearing
 yah uddhran arthshaastra ke vishay ko jahaan spasht karata he, vahaan is satya ko bhi prakashit karata he ki ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ se purv anek aacharyon ne arthshaastra kii rachanaaen kin, jinka uddeshy prithvi-vijay tathaa uske paalan ke upayon kaa pratipaadan karnaa tha
 Some names of those Acharyas and their sects have been directed in 'kautilya Arthashastra', although their works are not available today
 ye naam nimnlikhit he: In the tenants of these ten sects of economics, almost everything is known in relation to everyone, but very little introduction is found about Vishalaksha
 in naamon se yah to atyant spasht he ki arthshaastra nitishastra ke prati anek mahaan vichaarkon tathaa darshanikon kaa dhyaan gaya or is vishay par ek ujjwal sahitya kaa nirmaan hua
 Today that literature is lost
 anek videshi akramanon tathaa rajyakrantiyon ke kaaran is sahitya kaa naam-maatr shesh rah gaya he, parantu jitna bhi sahitya avshisht he vah ek vistrut arthshaastreey parampara kaa sanket karata he
 In this Arthashastra, such a system of governance has been enacted in which the king or ruler rules for the welfare of the subjects
 raja swechhachari hokar shashan nahin kar saktaa
 He has to rule over the subjects only after getting the help of the Council of Ministers
 rajya-purohit raja par ankush ke samaan he, jo dharm-maarg se chyut hone par raja kaa niyantran kar saktaa he or use kartavya-paalan ke liye vivash kar saktaa he
 Kautilya, which is the form of an all-round nation, is clear from the following word of 'arthashastra' - arthath-praja ke sukh main raja kaa sukh he, prajake hit main uskaa hit he
 The king has nothing but his own love, the beloved of the people is his favorite
 400 ri0 san ke lagbhag kaamandak ne kautilya ke arthshaastra ke aadhaar par kaamandakeey nitisar naamak 20 sargon main vibhakt kavyarup ek arthshaastra likhaa tha
 It also considers the principles of ethics and foreign policy
 somdev suri kaa nitivakyamrita, hemachandra kaa laghu arthniti, bhoj kaa yuktikalpataru, shukr kaa shukraniti aadi kuch duusare suprasiddh arthshaastra hai, jinako nitishastra ke vyaavhaarik paksh kii vyakhya karne vaale granthon ke antargat bhi gina ja saktaa he

 The American Immigration Lawyers Association described the situation as a crisis and was cited by the Wall Street Journal, Businessweek and the Washington Post

congress ne is kami se nipatane ke liye ek vidheyak laane par vichaar kiya, lekin antat kaarykram ko sanshodhit nahin kiya gaya
 However, no amendment was passed for the program
 is baat ko sunishchit karne kii zimmedaari amareeki department of lebar kii hoti he ki videshi karmchaaree amareeki karmchaariyon kaa sthaan na le len yaa unke vetan athwa kaary kii paristhitiyon par bura prabhaav na daalen
 Although it is not necessary for an employer to advertise the position before hiring an H-1B non-immigrant as per H-1B visa permission, it is necessary for the employer to inform the employee's representative about the LCA Or if no such representative is present, it is necessary for the employer to publish the LCA at the workplace or in his office
 niyoktaaon ko yah anupramanit karnaa chaiye ki diya jane vaala vetan kam se kam us vetan ke baraabar he, jo niyokta dwaara usee kaary ke liye samaan anubhav va arhataaon vaale anya karmchaariyon ko diya jaataa he, athwa vaikalpik rup se kaary ke abhisht kshetra ke liye prachlit vetan diya janaa chaiye, jo bhi adhik ho

 Other factors, such as age and skills, were not allowed to be considered for the prevailing salary

 yah ekmaatr prachlit vetan kaary-vidhi he, jiske prayog kii anumati kanoon ke dwaara di gai he, jisamen kaary va sthaan ke atirikt anya kaarak shaamil hai
 The approval process for these applications is based on the attestation of the employer and the documentary evidence presented

 In 2007, the US Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration, announced two programs, High Growth Training Initiative and Workforce Innovation Regional Economic Development, which were awarded H-1B training fees to educate and train American employees, respectively

 ech-1bi karmchaariyon ke liye aay kaa karadhaan is baat par nirbhar hota he ki ve kar ke uddeshyon ke liye gaiyr-nivasee bahya nagarikon ke rup main shreneebaddh hai yaa nivasee bahya nagarikon ke rup main

 The determination of this classification is based on the "actual attendance test": if the actual attendance test indicates that the holder of the H-1B visa is a resident citizen, income taxation is the same as any other US citizen and is referred to in Form 1040 and Can be submitted using the required schedules; Otherwise, the visa holder must submit the tax as a non-resident external citizen compulsorily using the Form 1040 NR or 1040 NR-EZ; If any tax agreements exist between the United States and the visa holder country of citizenship, then he can claim his benefits

 In addition to consulting a scholarly professional tax adviser who knows the rules for foreign nationals, assistance can also be taken from IRS Publication 519, US Tax Guide for Aliens
 yuassiaies ke anusaar, "ech-1bi bahya naagarik keval yachikakarta amareeki niyokta ke liye or yachika main varnit ech-1bi gatividhiyon main hi kaary kar sakate hai
 If all applicable rules are being followed, the petitioner may appoint a US employer H-1B employee at another employer's workplace

 Theoretically, the maximum duration for an H-1B visa has been set at six years
 jo ech-1bi dharak chah varsh kii avadhi ke baad bhi america main kaary karnaa jari rakhana chaahate hon, lekin jinhone sthaayee nivasee kaa darja praapt na kiya ho, unke liye ech-1bi visa ke liye punah aavedan karne se purv ek varsh kii avadhi tak america se baahar nivas karnaa anivaary hota he
 There are usually two exceptions for the six-year duration of an H-1B visa: yadhyapi ech-1bi visa ek gaiyr-apravasi visa he, lekin yah dwait-uddeshyon ke rup main pahachaani jane vaali kuch visa shreniyon main se ek he, jiskaa arth yah he ki is visa kaa dharak rahete hue bhi ech-1bi dharak kaa ek kanoonee apravasana uddeshy ho saktaa he
 In the past, the employment-based green card process took only a few years, less than the duration of the automatic H-1B visa
 haalanki, haalia samay main kanoonee rojgaar-aadhaarit apravasana prakriya main na bhare gayi padon kii sankhya itani adhik ho chuki he or yah prakriya itani adhik pichad gai he ki kuch vishisht deshon ke kushal vyavsaayik aavedakon ko apane green card praapt karne main kai varshon kaa samay lagata he
 Since there is no change in the duration of the H-1B visa, this means that as long as the green card applications of H-1B visa holders are in process, there will be an even greater number of h to remain in valid status
 1B visa holders have to renew their visa in one-year or three-years
 sanyukt rajya america main prativarsh jari kiye jane vaale ech-1bi visa kii sankhya congress ke aadesh se jari kiye jane vaale ek vaarshik cote par nirbhar hoti he
 Each H-1B quota is applicable to a specific financial year, beginning on 1 October
 aagaamee vittiya-varsh ke liye aavednon ko sweekrut karne kii prakriya kii shuruaati usase purv aane vaali pehali april se hoti he
 Those beneficiaries who are currently holding H-1B status or who have held H-1B status at any time during the last six years, are not considered eligible for the annual quota
 This annual quota has a significant impact on the high-tech industry
 saamanytah ise 65,000 visa prati varsh nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he, jisamen mukt kiye gayi sansthaanon, jaise vishvavidhyalayon va mahavidhyalayon main karyrat karmchaariyon ke kuch apwaad shaamil hote hai 
 san 2000 main, congress ne vishvavidhyalayon or shaskeey anusandhan prayogshaalaon ko diye jane vaale ech-1bi visa ko kota se sthaayee rup se chhot pradaan kii
 During the early years of this quota, access to the number of this quota was really rare in the early 1990s
 haalanki 1990 ke dashak ke madhya tak aate-aate, yah kota prativarsh pehle aao-pehle paao ke aadhaar par bharaa jane laga, jiske parinamswaroop naye ech-1bi visa aavedan asweekrut yaa vilambit hone lage kyonki vaarshik kota pehle hi bhar jaaya karata tha
 In 1998, this quota was first increased to 115,000 and then in 2000, 195,000 visas per year
 jin varshon ke dauraan yah kota 195,000 tha, un varshon ke dauraan is sankhya tak kabhi nahin pahunchaa ja sakaa
 At the end of the temporary increase passed by the Congress in 1999, in FY 2004, the quota was again at 90,000
 tab se, yah kota punah bahut tivrata se prativarsh bharta ja rahaa he, jiske parinamswaroop ech-1bi visa praapt karnaa lagaataar kathin hota ja rahaa he
 In more recent times, the basic quota has been maintained at 65,000, but in addition the U

 It is possible to issue 20,000 additional visas for the employees who have received higher degrees from 65,000 kii kul sankhya main se, praarambhik rup se 6,800 visa chile va singapore ke saath hue mukt-vyapaar samjhauton ke antargat un deshon ke nagarikon ke liye arakshit hote hai; haalanki yadi in samjhauton ke antargat arakshit in visa kaa prayog nahin kiya jaataa, to ye visa saamaanya samooh main waapas chale jate hai
 Another similar but more flexible program, the E-3 Visa Program, is available to Australian nationals 10,500 visas annually, outside the quota of 65,000 visas

 The quota for additional 20,000 H-1B visas available to higher degree holders was completed on 26 July
 vitt-varsh 2008 ke liye, puraa kota aavednon ko sweekaar kiye jane kii shuruyaat vaale din, 2 april kii samaapti se purv hi puri tarah bhar gaya
 Under USCIS regulations, 123,480 petitions received on April 2 and April 3 were to be grouped to the maximum limit and 65,000 of them were randomly selected for the next process
 vitt-varsh 2008 ke liye, atirikt 20,000 ucch oopaadhidhaariyon ke ech-1bi visa kaa kota 30 april ko puraa ho gaya
 In its annual report on H-1B visas released in November 2006, USCIS stated that it issued 131,000 H-1B visas in FY 2004 and 117,000 visas in FY 2005
 This reduction in data is because the H-1B visa may be exempted from the maximum limit if the employer is a university or a research laboratory
 vitt-varsh 2009 ke liye, yuassiaies ne 8 april 2008 ko ghoshnaa kii ki us varsh ke liye visa kaa puraa kota, 20,000 ucch oopaadhidhaariyon kaa kota or 65,000 kaa buniyadi kota donon, puure ho chuke hai
 USCIS will complete the initial data-entry of all applications received between April 1 and April 7, 2008, before the draw of the lottery
 vitt-varsh 2010 ke liye, yuassiaies ne 21 disambar 2009 ko ghoshnaa kii ki us varsh ke cote ko puraa karne ke liye paryaapt aavedan praapt ho chuke hai
 Trend analysis suggests that the FY 2011 ceiling will be attained sometime between early October and November as the economy picks up and the recession is taking place

 Matloff's research paper for the University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform claims that there has been no shortage of qualified US citizens to fill computer-related US jobs and to meet labor shortages in American institutions
 The data presented as proof of the need for an H-1B visa was flawed

 High-tech companies often point to a shortage of tech-workers when appealing to Congress to increase the H-1B visa's maximum annual limit of 65,000, but this claim according to a study by John Miano and the Center for Immigration Studies There is no empirical data confirming

 Although often described as a program for highly skilled employees, the H-1B non-immigrant visa category applies exclusively to specialty occupations

 Specialty tasks are defined as positions that require theoretical or technical expertise in a specialized field, and are generally interpreted as tasks that require at least a bachelor's degree Be necessary
 Typical H-1B tasks include architects, engineers, computer programmers, accountants, physicians, veterinarians, dentists, registered nurses, business managers, and college professors

 Another serious complaint to critics from the H-1B program is the reduction in pay: some studies have found that H-1B employees are paid significantly less than US employees

 Professor George J
 Harvard from the National Bureau of Economic Research
 a paper presented by Borjas found that "an immigration-induced 10 percent increase in the number of doctoral-educated people leads to a reduction in the salary of competitive employees by about 3 to 4 percent
" " It is expected that the LCA included in the H-1B petition should ensure that H-1B employees are paid according to the salary currently prevailing in the labor market, or the actual average salary of the employer, but evidence Employers do not follow these provisions and pay actual prevailing salary despite the provision of severe penalties for violators

 It has been reported in some recent news reports that the recession that began in 2008 will spoil the H1-B visa situation for both the program's supporters and those opposing it
 The process of obtaining a green card has been so long that during these years of recession it is not uncommon for sponsor companies to fail invisibly, causing H1-B workers to find another sponsor and queue up the green card Be forced to lose your place
 It is possible that an H1-B worker is only one month away from getting a green card, but if he is fired, he will have to leave the country or go to the end of the queue and start the process of getting a green card
 Depending on their nationality and visa category, they may have to wait for another 10 years
