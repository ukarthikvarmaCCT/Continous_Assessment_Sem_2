 Hazrat died in 632 AD, but by then almost all tribes of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam

 In childhood, he was called by two names, his mother used to call him Muhammad and grandfather Abdul Muttalib called him Ahmed
 He was a member of the Banu Hashim clan, a respected branch of the prestigious and influential Qureshi tribe
 According to Islamic books, before the birth of Muhammad, his mother had seen many spasms, in which he was told about his godliness and spiritual significance
 One of them is the following: "ootiyat ummuhu fil manaami faki-l laha annaki ha-m-lat sayyidal aalami-na va kheral variyati fa-sammihu mohammadan ija va-ja-atahu satu hmdu biha0" Muhammad was orphaned at a young age
 a few months before the birth of Hazrat, Hazrat Abdullah left for Palestine and al-sham with a trading caravan
 Due to the difficult journey and illness, he stayed for rest in the last leg of the journey, the village of his paternal grandmother Salma Bint Amr, who was in Medina, and the convoy left him behind and left for Mecca City
 After receiving news of Abdullah's illness by the caravan, Hazrat Abdul Mutallib sent his elder son al-harit to Medina, but after leaving there al-harit learned that his brother had died a month after the illness
 , And was buried at darun-nabiya

 According to a custom, Allah’s Rasul has said that "I am the best speaking Arab, so i was born in Quraysh and grew up in Saad"
 | In Bani Saad, Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam spent the first five years of his life with his foster-mother Halima Saadia

 Trees or vegetation means the vegetative life of an area or plant life on land and is not related to any specific race, form of life, composition, spatial spread, or other botanical or geographical features

 Vegetation types in North America are based on a combination of the following parameters - climate patterns, plant habitats, phenology and / or growth types and dominant species
 The classification in the current US standard is hierarchical and incorporates non-fluorogenic parameters in the upper standards only in the lower two levels
 europe main, vargeekaran akasar bina jalwaayu, phenology yaa vikaas ke swaroopon ke bare main spasht baat kiye, adhiktar or kabhi-kabhi puri tarah floristic sanrachana par nirbhar karata he
 It often emphasizes the symbolic or diagnostic race that distinguishes one type from another

 sabase nichalaa str, yaa sambandh, sabase sahi tareeke se paribhaashit he or ek prakaar kii ek se teen pramukh jatiyon ke naamon kaa samaves karata he
 For example, the definition of a vegetation type at the class level may be "forest, canopy cover> 60%", at the level of texture, "winter rain, broad-leaved, evergreen, sclerophyllous, closed canopy forest"; At the level of Mel, "arbutus Manizi One"; And at the level of the relationship, it is called "'arbutus mengisi - Lithocarpus densiflora forest", which is the Pacific madron-tannoque forest found in California and Origan, USA

 vanaspati main gatishiltaa ko mukhyatah jati kii sanrachana or / yaa vanaspati rachana ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Occasionally, a variety of processes or events can change, but for ease they can be divided into sudden or slow categories
 achaanak hone vaale parivartan saamanytah updrav kehalaate hai – inamen jangal kii aag, tej hawaaen, bhuskhalan, baadh, himaskhalan jaisi ghatnaayen shaamil hai
 The reasons for these are usually outside the community — these are natural processes that are independent of the natural processes of the community
 aisi ghatnaayen vanaspati rachana or jati kii sanrachana main bahut teji se or lambii samyavadhi ke liye parivartan laa sakati hai or vishaal kshetra ko prabhavit kar sakati hai
 There are very few ecosystems that do not have regular and frequent disturbances and are part of every long-term dynamic mechanism
 aag or hawa ke updrav vishwa bhar main anek vanaspati prakaaron main vishesh rup se aam hai
 Fire is particularly strong because it can destroy not only the living plants but also the seeds, spores and living meristems, which represent the next generation, and the fauna, soil properties and other ecosystems and other ecosystems

 Slow-temporal change is ubiquitous — it contains an area of eccentric rotation

 Furthermore, predicting the properties of such conditions, even if not reduced, is not always possible

 Botanists study the causes of the types and processes observed in vegetation at different scales of places and times

 Such questions often occur on a large scale and hence cannot be solved easily by using any manipulation
 That is why observational studies are very common in botany, with the help of knowledge of Vannasastra, Paleovanushastra, ecology, soil science etc

 In the United States, Henry Coles and Fredrik Clements developed ideas of vegetative rot in the early 20th century
 klement ab amaanya superarganism ke rup main vanaspati samudaay ke varnan ke liye prasiddh he
 He argued that just as all the organisms in a person work together to help the body work well and which develop together as a person becomes an adult, similarly in the vegetative community, every caste is very closely coordinated and Develops and co-ordinates with synergy and pushes the vegetation community to a defined and predetermined end state
 haalanki klements ne uttari american vanaspati par bahut kaary kiya, superarganism ke prati uski bhakthi ne uski pratishtha ko dhakka pahunchaaya he, kyonki anekon shodhakartaaon dwaara kiye gaye kaary main uske vichaar ko samarthan nahin mila he
 Contrary to Clements, many situational scientists have shown that the individual hypothesis, which states that the vegetation community is the total accumulation of a group of species reacting to the environment, is correct and decreases simultaneously in time and space
 remenski ne rus main yah vichaar prastut kiya or 1926 main henry gliyasana ne united stats main ise ek paper main viksit kiya
 Clementsian ideas had so much influence that Gliasson's ideas were rejected for many years

 In studies of three very different montane ecosystems, Whitaker showed that castes react primarily to the environment and have no coordination with other nearby castes
 Other work, particularly on paleobotany, supports this idea over large temporal and spatial scales
 1960 ke dashak se, vanaspatilok par adhiktar shodh kaaryaatmak paristhitishastra ke vishyon par kendrit ho gaya he
 In the functional framework, taxonomy is of little importance and all research focuses on the species' anatomical, anatomical, and anatomical classification, and its purpose is to predict how specific groups will behave toward different environmental variables
 The basis of such an approach is the assumption that high levels of phylogenetic taxonomy and large spatial scales often do not have a strong correlation between phylogenetic expectation and environmental adaptation, particularly due to centripetal evolution and adapted radiation

 This was followed by other classifications such as macarthur's - r per k - selective race and the C-S-R scheme proposed by Grimes, in which castes according to one or more of three strategies, each favored by a selective pressure-competitive, coercion
 Is divided into tolerators and ruderals

 According to the game's backdrop, the Union Aerospace Corporation) is the largest existing corporate entity and has established a research facility on Mars
 is aadhaar par, euasi kai vaigyanik kshetron main anusandhan karne main sakasham he, jisamen unnat hathiyaaron kaa vikaas, jaivik anusandhan, antariksh anveshan or teleportesan shaamil hai
 Due to the facility status on Mars, UAC can conduct its activities outside of legal and ethical boundaries
 jaise jaise khiladi game main aage badhata he, use gyaat hota he ki aadhaar par karmchaaree asthir hai
 a large number of incidents are due to this instability such as hearing noises, obscuring visuals, and increasing cases of dementia and paranoia, often leading to fatal accidents from the facility's machinery
 euasi kii delta leb divijan main prayogon kii prakruti ke bare main afvaahen vishesh rup se aadhaar ke karmchaariyon main prachlit hai
 Doom 3 has five main characters
 khiladi ko ek anaam antariksh marine korporal kii bhoomika nibhaani hoti he jo euasi ke mangal base par abhi pahunchaa hi he
 The player's non-commissioned officer in charge is master sergeant Thomas Kelly, voiced by Neil Ross, who tells the player his objectives and advises the player on the radio in the first half of the game
 kahani main doctor mailkam betrugar ek maanavtaa virdohi bhoomika main hai, jo euasi ke rahasyamayi delta leb prabhag ke pramukh vaigyanik hai, jo maanavtaa kaa virodh karne ke liye nark ke balon ke sahyog main kaam karte hai
 Betruger's Damon-like voice, Philip L
 Given by Clarke, who taunts the bar player as the game progresses
 antim do pramukh paatr iliyat swaan or jaik campbell hai
 Swann, voiced by Charles Dennis, is a representative of the UAC Board of Directors, sent him to investigate Betruger's research and an increasing number of accidents at the Mars base following a request for assistance from Wistleblower goes
 lagbhag puure samay ke dauraan campbell ke dwaara unka saath diya jaataa he, ek or antariksh marine jo swaan ke angrakshak kaa kaam karata he or uske paas bienji 9000 hathiyaar he
 Campbell is voiced by Andy Chenley
 swaan or campbell aksar game main khiladi se kuch kadam aage rahete hai, lekin game ke ant tak bhi un tak pahunchaa nahin ja saktaa or unase baatcheet nahin kii ja sakati he
 Some minor characters have also been included in the game which give details of the story and help the player at particular locations
 bhinn anusandhanon or vikaas prograamon or nirmaan kaaryon main lage hue kai vaigyanikon se khiladi kii muthbhed euasi ke madhyam se hoti he, saath hi saathi marine or suraksha gardon se bhi mulaakaat hoti he
 Civilian employees engaged in civil works and employees engaged in maintenance work are also seen
 duum 3 kii kahani main game main aane vaale samvaad or cat drishy shaamil hai, saath hi puure game ke dauraan i-mail, audio log or video filein bhi maujuud hai
 Elliott Swann and Jack Campbell arrive at Mars at the beginning of the game, primarily as they arrive at uac's Mars base, using the Earth's means of transportation, with the player's anonymous Marine following them right behind
 suvidha ke bare main shikayaton or ghatnaon kii jaanch ke pehle hisse ke rup main swaan or campbell melkom betrugar ke saath ke sammelan baithak bulaate hai, jabaki marine master sargent thomas keli ke aadesh ke anusaar chalati he
 Kelly instructs the marine to find a scientist at Delta Lab who has gone missing
 marine ko vaigyanik paas hi kii dikmishan sanchaar suvidha main mil jaataa he, jahaan vah betrugar ke teleportesan prayog ke bare main dharti par euasi ko chetavanee bhejne kii jabardast koshish kar rahaa he
 However, as he tries to clarify the Marines about the situation, another tele portation test is performed and control is lost, at which point the entire Mars base is shaking with unnatural shocks, most of the base's staff zombies
 , As the forces of Hell invade through the teleporter's portal
 ab base ke zombis main badal chuke karmchaariyon or nark ke damens ke hamale ko rokane ke liye, marine mangal shahar main lautati he, jahaan keli remote se marine ko duusari marine ke saath link banane ke aadesh detaa he or kahata he ki mukhya sanchaar suvidha par kol karne ke liye ek sancharan card praapt karne ke liye kahata he
 As the marines move through the base, they find that Swan and Campbell are alive, they are also heading to the communications facility to prevent sending a message according to the state of Mars
 marine daste par damens ke dwaara hamalaa kiya jaataa he, unhen maaraa jaataa he, or yadhyapi marine sancharan card praapt kar leti he, lekin itani der ho jaati he ki sanchaar suvidha main upkarnon ko campbell ke dwaara nasht kiye jane se nahin roka ja saktaa
keli, haalanki, marine ko ek byaap system kaa nirdesh detaa he, marine ko aadesh diya jaataa he ki vah yaa to keli ke aadesh ko maan le yaa mangal ko alag rakhane ke liye swaan ke tark ko sweekaar kare, jab tak akraman kii sahi prakruti ko samaj na liya jaye, taaki dharti ko koi khatara naa ho
 Depending on whether the transmission is sent, the Marines are asked by Kelly or Swann to go to the Delta Lab
 delta leb ke raste main, marine betrugar se milti he, jo ab prithvi par akraman karne ke liye spasht rup se nark ke sahyog main kam kar rahaa he
 If the Marines did not send a call of distress to Earth, Betruger himself would have done so and presumably with the help of the ships the daemons would have been brought to Earth
 Betruger then unsuccessfully attempts to kill the marines using toxic gases at the base's recirculation facility
 delta leb pahunchane paramareen teleportesan prayogon main chupe vivaran ko jaan leti he, saath hi mangal kii sataha main puratathvik khudaai, betrugar kaa pareekshanon ke prati badhata junun or nark se namoonay praapt karne ke abhiyaanon ke bare main bhi ise pataa chalata he
 The excavation finds ruins of an ancient civilization on Mars and from it a relic is known as the Soul Cube
 ek vaigyanik ke anusaar marine leb main zindaa paayi jaati he, sol kyub ek hathiyaar he jise nark ke balon se suraksha karne ke liye pracheen sabhyataa ke dwaara banaaya gaya he
 The scientist also states that the invasion began when Betruger took the Soul Cube into the portal at the beginning of the game and deposited it in Hell
 marine leb ke madhyam se betrugar ko pakad leti he, lekin betrugar ko jaal main fansaae jane ke baad use mukhya teleportesan portal main khinch liya jaataa he
 Portal leads the Marines directly to Hell, where he fights through a large number of Daemons for the Soul Cube and defeats his Daemonic Guardian
 iske baad marine nark main shodh abhiyaanon ke dwaara chode gaye teleportesan upkarnon ko phir se shuru karne main sakasham ho jaataa he or delta leb main laut jaataa he
 Betruger, however, tells the Marines that although the main UAC teleporter has been destroyed, Hell is opening a Hell's Gate on Mars, capable of bringing several million daemons to Mars
 iske baad delta lebs main, marine kii muthbhed ek ghayal swaan se hoti he
 Swan informs the Marine that Kelly has been working with Hell the whole time and has been transformed by the Daemons
 marine ko bataate hue ki campbell keli ke peeche gaya he, swaan marine ko apana pidie detaa he, jisamen mangal kii sataha ke neeche nark ke dwaar kii sthiti kii jaankaree hoti he or use vishvas dilaataa he ki vah akele base se bahaar nikalne kaa rasta dhundne kii koshish karegaa
 However, when Campbell is caught up with Campbell in the central computer processing sector of the Marine Base, Campbell is badly injured and is only able to say that Kelly is carrying Campbell's BFG 9000 weapon before he dies
 iske baad keli demen kii aawaaj main marine par taana kasne lagata he
 Kelly is eventually confronted by the Marine in the Central Computer Corps, who describes Kelly as a cybernetic human grafted onto a tank-like base
 marine keli ko marane main safal ho jaataa he or marine kii sataha ke neeche or gaharaai main sait 3 tak jane se pehle bienji 9000 le letaa he, yah vahi puratathvik khudaai he jahaan sol kyub tha
 At the primary excavation site, the Marine discovers Hell's Gate, which is guarded by Hell's mighty warrior, Cyberdemon
 sol kyub kaa upyog karte hue, marine siberdeman ko ladaai main haraa detaa he or iske baad sol kyub nark ke dwaar ko sil kar detaa he
 The final cut scene shows the forces arriving at the base from Earth in search of a massacre
 ve marine ko jivit pate hai, lekin unhen pataa chalata he ki swaan mar chukaa he
 They, however, are unable to locate Betruger, who is shown in Hell in the final scene, who has incarnated a dragon-like demon
 june 2000 main, ai di software game ingine ke diziner jon keramek ne ek aantarik company yojana bataayi jisamen agali peedi kii takanic kaa upyog karte hue duum ke rimek kii ghoshnaa kii gayi
 The plan revealed that there was growing controversy over ID software remaking Doom
 ai di software ke do maalik, kevin cloud or adrian keramek, hameshaa se duum kii rimeking kaa virodh kar rahe the, unka maananaa tha ki ai di aksar samaan sutron or gundharmon kii taraf laut rahaa he
 However, following the positive reception of Return to Castles Wolfenstein and the modern improvement in technique rendering, most employees agreed that the remake was a right idea and that both owners were offered an ultimatum: allowing them to remake Doom To be given or fired
 After a fairly amicable confrontation, an agreement was made to work on Doom 3

 According to John Kermack, development took longer than expected; Originally, the game was planned to be released on Christmas 2003
 duum 3 ne 14 july 2004 ko gold kaa darja praapt kar liya or agle hi din ek mek oes eks release kii pushti kar di gayi

 Finally, the revised Xbox conversion was released on 3 April 2005
 game kii release ke ek saptaah pehle, yah gyaat hua ki duum 3 main ieex audio takanic ko shaamil karne ke liye idi software or creative lebs ke dwaara ek samjhauta kiya gaya he, jo duusari company ke ek software patent se bahut adhik prabhavit he
 This patent deals with technology that was meant to display shadows, and was called the reverse of Kermack, developed independently by both John Kermack and Creative Lab's programmers
 idi software ko puure ho chuke game main takanic ke upyog ke liye kanoonee daayitv ke tahat rakhaa janaa tha, isliye is mudde ko khatm karne ke liye, ai di software kshatipurti ke badale main creative leb technologys ko license dene ke liye sahamat ho gaya
 According to John Kermack, the principal graphics engine developer at id Software, the technology of Doom 3 was supported by three primary features: integrated lighting and shading, complex animation, and scripting that is fully dynamic on-pixel lighting and stencil shadows
 Depicts reality with and a GUI surface that includes additional interactivity for the game
 duum 3 ke liye viksit kii gayi ai di tech 4 graphics ingine kii unnat kunjee ekikrut prakaash or chhayakaran he
 Most sources of light are computed in real-time, rather than computing and rendering light maps when constructing maps and saving information in map data
 isse yahaan tak ki asthir vastuon jaise monster or mashinari par bhi prakaash kii chaaya padati he, jo sthir prakaash maanchitron ke saath asambhav tha
 One drawback to this approach is the engine's inability to create moist shadows and full illumination
 game kii duniya ke saath antarkriyasheeltaa ko badhaane ke liye, idi software ne in—game computers ke liye ucch-rejolution anemated screen ke sainkadon dizin banaaye hai
 Instead of using a common "use key" key, the crosshair acts like a mouse cursor on the screen and helps the player use the computer in the game world

 The expansion was characterized by a twelve-level single-player campaign, set two years after the original story line and three new weapons, one of which is geared towards physics in the game

 Multiplayer games were promoted, officially increasing the player limit to eight, and adding new twists to the game such as capturing the flag

 ID Tech 4, the game engine for Doom 3, is so successful that other developers may not be licensed for use, such as Human Head Studios' Pre and Splash Damage
 Enemy Territory: Quake Wars Doom 3 received favorable reception from critics, with its PC version scoring 87 percent and 88 percent on review compilation Metacritic sites and in gameranking, respectively
 duum 3 ' ke graphics or pregentation kii gunvattta kii bahut prashansa kii gayi; game spot ne game ke vaataavaran ko "anukool rup se sajiv, ghanaa vayumandaleey or ascharyajanak rup se mahangaa" kahkar varnit kiya, jabaki pisi gemer euke ne graphics or gaiyr-khiladi paatr modling or anemeshan ko bahut "pravaahee" bataaya
 ign's Dan Adams noted that the game's presentation included a very high proportion of the game, adding that "without the atmosphere, Doom 3 is a simple shooter, similar to the '90s
" "iske alaava, kai samikshakon ne kam graphics str par game ko itnaa acha banane ke liye ai di software kii prashansa kii he
 Many critics have also praised the game's premises and settings; Greg Kaswin of Game Spot described "the feeling that is in Doom 3 is completely in the real world" while IGN notes that "UAC Base also has a very realistic sense of being, which gives a feel of reality
" vishesh rup se eurogemer ne kaha ki game kaa shuruuaati anukram valve software ke half life ko paribhaashit karne vaale "utkrisht vichaaron par feet baithta he"
 Many reviewers stated that Doom 3 was a "run and gun" game genre that was successful with its predecessors, and the game was alternately praised and criticized for this component
 kuch samay ke baad game main upasthit sincranizeshan kii kai jatil samikshaayen kii gayin
 In addition, the game's artificial intelligence was not considered particularly challenging, with gamespot noting that "the enemy follows the same type of predictable patterns that might be remembered from previous Doom games" while gamespy stated that The way enemies attack the player is "bizarre"; According to critics, players feel that by lifting a weapon many types of zombies come out of the dark into hidden chambers
 iske alaava, kai samikshakon ne kaha ki game kaa kahani kaa sandesh dene kaa tarika "aprabhavi" he, khiladi paatr ke liye pahchaan kii kami ise jatil banaati he
 Finally, the game's multiplayer is lacking in upgrades, as its player limits are low and the number of game modes is small, especially in contrast to id Software's Influential Quake III Arena
 duum 3 ke eks box sanskaran ko samaan str kaa samarthan praapt hua, ise metacritic par 88 pratishat or gameranking par 87

 The game was praised as a PC version and pointed fingers at a number of similar issues, although the game was praised for a smooth and user friendly control on the gamepad, as well as a multi-player turn supporting two players
 It was described by IGN as "suitable for the price of its admission"
 haalanki, game ingine main dhimi gati kii kuch aapchana kii gayi, eks box par maapan main neeche girane ke baavjood, abhi bhi eks box hardware par isaki maang he

 In object oriented programming, inheritance is a way of creating new classes using previously defined classes
 Inheritance is used for reuse in existing code with little or no modification
 nae varg, jo sab-class ke rup main jane jate hai, purv-prachlit virgon ke gun or vyavhaar viraasat main pate hai, jo super-class ke rup main nirdisht kiye jate hai
 The hereditary relationship of sub and super-class gives rise to hierarchy
 simula ke liye 1967 main vanshanukram kii avadharana kaa avishkaar kiya gaya tha
 Inheritance should not be confused with polymorphism, commonly referred to as polymorphism in object-oriented programming
 vanshanukram karyanvayanon ke bich rishta he, jabaki up-prakaar bahurupata prakaaron ke bich sambandh he
 In some, but not all OOP languages, the objectives match because the only way to declare a subtype, is to define a new class that inherits the implementation of another
 vanshanukram ke liye vyavhaar up-prakaar kabhi aavashyak nahin he
 It is entirely possible to get a class whose object will misbehave when used in a context where the parent class is expected; See Liskov substitution theory
 jatil vanshanukram, yaa ek aparyaapt paripakv dizin main istemaal kiye gaye vanshanukram se yo-yo samasya paidaa ho sakati he
 The use of inheritance provides several benefits
 kabhi-kabhi in spandon main antar vaanchhneeya he, kyonki zaruri nahin ki ye sandarbh se spasht hon
 Many object-oriented programming languages allow a class or object to replace the implementation of an aspect — typically behavior — that it has inherited
 is prakriya ko saamanytah adhibhavi kaha jaataa he
 The overriding entails a complexity: Which version of the behavior implicit class urges to use — one that is part of its own class, or one that belongs to the parent class? The answer varies between programming languages and some languages provide the ability to inform it that no specific behavior is overridden and handled
 kisi anya varg main pehle se hi maujuud code kaa dubaara upyog, vanshanukram kaa upyog karne ke praarambhik prayojanon main se ek rahaa he
 This practice is commonly called inheritance implementation
 adhikansh kshetron main, code ke punah prayog ke ekmaatr uddeshy ke liye varg vanshanukram ke samarthan main kami ai he
 The primary concern is that implementation inheritance does not provide any assurance of polymorphic substitution-ability - reuse of the class does not necessarily replace the instance of the implicit class
 Delegation requires further programming effort, but substitution-capacity issues are avoided
 c + + main nijee vanshanukram ko bina pratisthaapan-kshamta ke hi karyanvayan vanshanukram ke rup main prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Where public inheritance represents the relationship "is" and delegation represents "exists", then private inheritance may be considered "in the context of the implementation of the relationship"
 object-oriented programing language ifal ke nirmaataa bartrend meyer dwaara likhit object-oriented software construction, dwitiya sanskaran main vanshanukram ke 12 alag upyogon ko soochibaddh kiya gaya he, jahaan adhikansh main vanshanukram karyanvayan kii kuch maatra shaamil he
 Many types of polymorphisms exist
 for example, - templats ,- sadsy / oparator atibhaar,- avapeedan or- up-prakaar bahurupata
 When one speaks of polymorphism with object orientation, it often means subtype polymorphism
 siddhanthata up-prakaar bahurupata kaa matlab he ki object kai prakaar ke ho sakate hai
 like class B: public a {}; b objects are not only b objects, they are also a objects
 yah vanshanukram ke madhyam se hasil hua he
 Now you can too, class c : public {}; And because of the subtype polymorphism, c objects are also a objects
 ab sthiti yah he ki donon, c or b object, a object bhi hone kii vajah se un donon ko a prakaar ke veriable bhi nirdisht kiye ja sakate hai
 This is what the subtype polymorphism performs
 lekin yah bilkul vyarth hoga, agar b or c object ekasmaan hon to
 acchhee baat he yah he ki unka aisa hona zaruri nahin, kyonki adhibhavi kii vajah se unke vyavhaar main antar laayaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore, the major language mechanism behind subtype polymorphism is inheritance
 The role of the overriding is to allow sub-type objects to share a common super-type, so that their behavior differs
 jab program ko dizine karte samay vanshanukram kaa vyapak rup se upyog kiya jaataa he, to uske dwaara aropit baadhaon ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana chahie
 For example, consider a class person that includes the person's name, address, phone number, age, gender, and caste
 We can define a subclass called Student of the Person which includes the grade-point average of the person and the classes taken, and another subclass of the person called Employee includes the person's job title, employer, and salary
 is vanshanugat padanukram ko paribhaashit karte samay, hamane pehle se hi kuch pratibandhon ko paribhaashit kiya he, jinamein sabhi vaanchhneeya nahin hai: The overall reuse principle is an alternative to inheritance
 yah takanic praathmik varg padanukram se vyavhaaron ko alag karte hue or kisi vyavsaayik kshetra ke varg dwaara apekshit vishisht vyavhaar virgon ko shaamil karte hue, bahurupata or code ke punah prayog kaa samarthan karata he
 This approach circumvents the static nature of the class hierarchy, allowing behavior changes in time and allowing a single class to apply a buffet style of behavior, rather than restricting the behavior of its ancestor classes
 kabhi-kabhi bhoomikaaon kii jagah vanshanukram-aadhaarit dizine kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 a role, suppose a person's role of a student, defines the characteristics associated with the object present, because the object has been participating in some relationship with another object
 Some object-oriented design systems do not see a difference in this use of roles from more static aspects of objects
 Thus there exists a tendency for the use of inheritance in model roles, to say that an individual's student role can be coined in the form of an individual's subclass
 lekin, naa to vanshanugat padanukram or naa hi vastuon ke prakaar samay ke saath badal sakate hai
 Therefore, coining roles as subclasses can cause roles to be assigned at creation, assuming that an individual cannot easily change his or her role as a student, if circumstances change
 modelling ke drushtikon se, aksar aise pratibandh vaanchhneeya nahin hai, kyonki yah vastu pranali ke bhavi vistaar par kritrim pratibandh lagaati he, jisase bhavishya main parivartanon ko lagu karnaa kathin ho saktaa he, kyonki vartmaan dizine ko adhyatan karne kii zarurat hogi
 vanshanukram ko aksar samanyikaran maansikta ke saath is prakaar behatar tareeqe se istemaal main laayaa ja saktaa he ki sodaaharan prastuti varg ke saamaanya pahaluon ko super-class ke kaarak banaae jate hai; maan len vyakti or company donon virgon ke liye, donon ke hi sabhi saamaanya pahaluon ke liye ek saamaanya super-class 'kanoonee-ikai' maujuud he
 The role can be distinguished between role-based design and inheritance-based design based on the consistency of the aspect
 bhoomika-aadhaarit dizine kaa istemaal us samay kiya jaae jab yah kalpana kii ja sakati he ki vahi vastu alag samay par alag-alag bhoomikaaon main bhaag leti he or vanshanukram aadhaarit dizine kaa upyog us samay kiya jaae jab kai virgon ke saamaanya pahaluon ko super-class ke kaarak banaae jaaen or ve samay ke saath badalte naa hon
 One consequence of the separation of roles and super-classes is that it can clearly distinguish aspects of compile time and run time of the object system
 is tarah spasht rup se vanshanukram sankalan-samay nirmaan he
 Inheritance affects the structure of many objects in time, but the different types of structure that can be used are already determined at compile-time
 is paddati se karmchaaree ke rup main vyakti ke udhaaharan ko model karne ke liye, modelling sunishchit karata he ki ek vyakti varg main keval aise parichaalan yaa data maujuud hai jo is baat kaa lihaaz kiye bina ki unka upyog kahaan ho rahaa he, prayek vyakti udhaaharan ke liye aam hai
 This would prevent the use of a member working in the person class, since not everyone could have a job, or at least not be aware that the person class was being used only for model job person examples is
 iske bajaay, object-oriented dizine, sabhi vyakti objecton ke kuch sab-set par "karmchaaree" kii bhoomika main vichaar karegaa
 naukari kii jaankaree keval karmchaaree bhoomika vaale objecton ke saath sambhddha kii jaaegi
 object-oriented dizine "naukari" ko bhi bhoomika ke rup main model karegaa, kyonki naukari ko samay main pratibandhit kiya ja saktaa he or isliye ek varg modelling ke liye yah sthai aadhaar nahin he
 The consistent static concept is either "workplace" or simply "work", depending on what the concept implies
 is prakaar, object-oriented dizine kii drushti se, ek "vyakti" varg or ek "kaarysthal" varg ho saktaa he, jo kai "main-kaam karata he" se is tarah judaa hota he ki vyakti kaa ek udhaaharan, karmchaaree kii bhoomika main he, jab vah ek naukari karata he, jahaan ek naukari uske kaary-sthal kii bhoomika us sthiti main he, jisamen vah karmchaaree kaam karata he
 Note that from this point of view, all classes that are constructed from this design process are part of the same domain, meaning they clearly define the subject using the same terminology
 kai baar yah anya tareekon ke liye sahi sabit nahin hota
 In particular, the distinction between roles and classes becomes difficult to understand if one takes contextual transparency, since roles are types of references and classes are types of referenced objects

 Diatoms are found in water and by looking at the place, different types of diatom colonies are found, so that we can easily find the crime scene
 dytome vividh prakaar ke sooksham shaiwal hai jo kii silica cell kii diwaar se bane hote hai
 Diatoms have many characteristics such as color, shape, etc
 dytome kii lagbhag 8000 jatiyaan hai
 The caste of each diatom is identified by the variety of silica found in them, which varies according to the environment
 jab yah sookshm shaiwal marate hai to inkaa frustule pani talachat bana detaa he
 With the help of this Frustule, we get to know the species of diatom, which also leads to the crime scene
 kisi bhi vyakti kii mrityu pani main doobane se hui he yaa nahin, iskaa pataa dytome ke pareekshan se chalata he
 The silica layer on the diatom is unaffected by acids and is readily found in all types of water
 jab koi jivit vyakti pani main duubataa he to saans lene ke saath pani fefdo main chalaa jaataa he or uske saath-saath pani main paae jane vaale dytome bhi us vyakti ke fefdon main chale jate hai
 With the flow of blood, these diatoms reach different parts of the body
 agar kisi bhi vyakti ke sharir ke vibhinn angon main dytome paae jate hai to ham kah sakate hai ki pani main doobane se pehle vyakti jivit tha
 Whereas if a person is thrown into water after death, then the presence of diatom is highest in the bones of the thigh and legs only
 dytome ke in pareekshanon kii madad se ham yah pataa laga sakate hai ki vyakti kii mrityu pani main doobane se hui he yaa phir mrit sharir ko pani main duboya gaya tha
 The time of death can also be detected by a diatom test
 jaise agar dytome pareekshan ke baad dytome kii colony kii jatiyaan 20 se kam hai to kah sakate hai ki mrityu ko kam se kam 7-12 din hue hai
 If the diatom species is more than 50, then in that case the death of the person is considered to be about 1 week

 aparaadh vahi he jise kanuunan manaa kiya gaya ho
 The thing which is denied in the then environment is the crime
 kintu, kanuunan nazaij kaam karnaa hi aparaadh nahin rah gaya he
 The point which Dr
 Gutner had raised has become a great subject for every court today
 vahi aparaagh he
 If while flying a kite on the roof, a stone comes down on the road from a boy's foot and falls on the head of another person, then that boy is not guilty of murder
 atev mahatv kii vastu niyat he
 Real justice can only be done by mixing the crime and its intention to commit it
 kintu samajashaastra ke panditonke saamne yah samasya bhi thi or he ki samaaj kii haani karanevaal ke saath vyavhaar kaisaa ho
 Aflatoon was of the opinion that it is unfair to harm the harm
 prasiddh samaaj-shastri jivik ne spasht kaha tha ki nyaay kabhi nahin chahta ki bhul karanevaal yani aparaadh karanwane ko pidaa pahunchaai jaae
 Lord Haldane also advised not to consider crime, but to consider the criminal, his problems, his environment
 britain ke prasiddh raajnneetijna tathaa kai baar praghan mantri bananevaale winston churchill kaa kathan he ki aparaadh tathaa apradhi ke prati janata kii kisi bhaavana tathaa drushti he, usee se us desh kii sabhyataa kaa vaastavik anumaan lag saktaa he
 British law considers the same act to be a crime that is done ill-favorably, voluntarily, cunningly, done, allowed or allowed
 bahut se aparaadh aise hote hai jo aparaadh hone ke karan hi aparaadh nahin samajhe jate
 For example, gene type marriages are illegal in the UK, so even if married, it would not be considered a marriage, such as marrying a girl under 16, etc
 naveen audyogic sabhyataa main aparaadh kaa rup tathaa prakaar bhi badal gaya he
 New types of crimes have started happening which are difficult to imagine
 isliye aparaadh kii pahchaan ab is samay yahi he ki kanoon ne jis kaam ko manaa kiya he, vah aparaadh he
 The one who has done the forbidden work is the culprit
 kintu, apradhi paristhiti kaa das ho saktaa he, vivash ho saktaa he, isliye use pahchaanane kaa praytn karnaa hoga
 Today's criminology does not believe that someone has become a worshiper by learning from the stomach or someone is deliberately making it his 'life'
 har ek aparaadh kaa tathaa har ek apradhi kaa adhyayan hona chahie
 That is why every crime and every criminal has become the subject of personal study, personal diagnosis and personal medicine
 manovigyaan aparaadh ko manushya kii maansik ulajhanon kaa parinaam maanata he
 a person whose childhood does not pass in an atmosphere of love and encouragement, many types of mental glands of inferiority are formed in his mind
 in grathiyon main uski man main uski bahut si maansik shakti sanchit rahati he
 Dr
 Alfred Adler states that a person who has mental glands of inferiority in his mind inevitably commits many kinds of crimes
 yah aparaadh vah isliye karata he ki swayan ko vah duusare logon se adhik balavaan siddh kar sake
 The gland of inferiority remains in the mind in this person, he is always in a state of inner mental dissatisfaction
 vah sab samay aise kaamon main apane ko lagaae rahata he jisase sabhi log uski ore dekhen or uski prashansa kare
 The mental gland of inferiority puts man in such works, due to which the human being has to hear many kinds of condemnation
 es vyakti swayan ko sadaa charchaa kaa vishay banaae rakhana chahta he
 If it is not discussed for good works then it should be for bad works
 uski maansik granthi use shant man nahin rahane detii
 She always inspires him to do special work
 yadi aise vyakti ko dand kiya jaae to isse uskaa sudhaar nahin hota, apitu isse uski maansik granthi or bhi jatil ho jaati he
 The treatment of such a criminal requires a mental doctor
 aadhunik manovigyaan ne hamen bataaya he ki samaaj main aparaadh ko kam karne ke liye dandvidhaan ko kadaa karnaa paryaapt nahin he
 For this education is required in the society
 jab manushya kii koi pravriti bachapan se hi prabal ho jaati he to aage chalkaar vah vishesh prakaar ke kaaryo main prakashit hoti he
 These works are beneficial for the society or are anti-social
 samajavirohi kaary hi hamen vyakti ke prati uchit drushtikon rakhana hoga
 The child who is kept dearly and is allowed to do all kinds of things, does not have the ability to relinquish his happiness for the happiness of others
 es vyakti kii saamaajik bhavanaayen aviksit rah jaati he
 Life does not create goodness
 iske kaaran vah na to samaajik drushti se bhale bure kaa vichaar kar saktaa he ore na bure kaamon se swayan ko rokane kii kshamta praapt kar paata he
 The parents of the child and the surrounding air conditioners and schools work in it
 uchit shiksha kaa ek uddeshy yahi he ki balak apane upar sanyam kii kshamta aa jaae
 The higher the state of self-control, the less the crime
 samaaj main bahut se log apane vivek se pratikul aparaadh karte hai
 What is the reason for this? According to the discoveries of modern psychology, the childhood of such people would not have passed properly
 ye log buddhi main to janm se hi praveen the atev ye anek prakaar ke vichaaron ko jaan sake
 But they did not have such permanent feelings in their mind in their childhood so that they can stop themselves from doing inappropriate work
 ye sthaayee bhav jab tak manushya ke swabhaav ke ang nahin ban jate tab tak ve manushya ko duraachaar se rokane kii kshamta nahin dete
 Such scholars commit crimes and even curse themselves for them
 isse ve apni maansik ulajhanein badha lete hai
 Sometimes they use their scholarship to prove the morality of their unfair actions
 inkaa sudhaar saamaanya dandvidhaan se nahin ho paata
 They devise many ways to avoid them
 aise logon ko sudhaarney ke liye aavashyak he ki shiksha kaa dhyey aajeevika kamanaa athwa vyavahaarakushalata praapt kar lenaa na hokar maanav vyaktitv kaa sampurna vikaas arthath bauddhik or bhavatmak vikaas ho
 When a person starts to see his own interest in the interest of others and gets the ability to conduct according to this idea, then only he is a qualified citizen of the society
 aisa vyakti jab kuch karata he, vah samaaj ke hit ke liye hi hota he
 Crime is a type of social asymmetry
 yah vyaktigat maansik vishmata kaa parinaam he
 This type of asymmetry starts in childhood
 iske sudhaar ke liye prarambh main aadat daalani padati he ki vah dusron ke sukh main nij sukh kaa anubhav kare
 He should do such things which will benefit everyone and praise him
 hindu dharamshastron ke anusaar saamanyatya chalit dharamshastra ke niyam, saamaajik niyam or rajanium ke viruddh aacharan karnaa hi aparaadh hai
 The field of Hindu theology is very broad, under which the idea of violation of all kinds of rules, economic, political, social etc
 is available
 isi ke anusaar hindu dharamshastron main saamaanya rup se 32 prakaar ke aparaadh bataae gaye hai
 The number of them can also be more because the nature of these crimes also varies according to the variation of country, time and society
 isliye bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke vichaar vyakt karte dikhaai padate hai
 Hindu theology or memoir appears to express different views regarding crimes and their punishments
 hindu dharamshastra ke antargat aparaadh ke swaroop par vichaar karne ke liye manu, yajyavlky, parashar, naarad, brihaspati, katyayan aadi ko pramaan mana jaataa hai
 In considering the crime from a mental point of view, Lambrozo had said long ago that the body of a criminal has a special shape
 parantu us samay unke mat ko manyata nahin mili
 Recently some experiments were conducted on criminals which concluded that 60 percent of the criminals have abnormal body designs
 raktakoshika main rahanevaale 23 gunasutra yugmon main se aparaadhiyon kaa 21vaan gunasutra yugma asaamaanya paaya gaya
 In 1968, an argument was made in a court of Celadan against a man, the murderer of his four children, that my chromosome is super-primitive, that is, the sequence of chromosomes in my blood cells is 'XY', which caused my crime psychosis
 It is natural and i have murdered my children to abdicate responsibility in an abnormal mental state
 nyaayalay ne faisle main yadhyapi uski asaamaanya maansik shaareerik banaavat kaa ullekh nahin kiya gaya to bhi asaamaanya dasha ke aadhaar par apradhi ko chhod diya gaya
 In 1969, Dr
 Hargovind Khurana received the Nobel Prize by rendering the genetic signal theory according to which the behavior of a person depends on the structure of his gene group and the structure of the gene group is based on heredity

 haraa prishthbhumi bangladesh ke hare-bhare zamin kaa pratik he
 The flag is based on the sound used during the 1971 Bangladesh War of Independence, which had a yellow map inside the red circle
 1972 main ise hataa diya gaya kyonki maanchitr ko dhvaj ke donon ore darshana kathin tha
 The first version of the flag was created on 6 June 1970 by Swadhin Bangla Biplabi Parishad, a group of students from Dhaka University

 These are called zero

 The Reiman hypothesis is associated with the locations of these non-trivial zeros

 If this hypothesis falls out, then all non-trivial zeros reside on a complex LAN that is filled with complex numbers that are of the type 1 / 2 + i t

 Insurance is the means by which the risk of loss can be passed on to the other party by paying some fee
 jis paksh kaa jokhim beemaakar par daalaa jaataa he use 'bimaakrit' kehete hai
 An insurer is usually a company that is willing to share the loss or damage of the insured and is able to do so
 beemaa ek prakaar kaa anubandh he
 An agreement that is legally enforceable in two or more persons is called a contract
 beemaa anubandh kaa vyapak arth he ki bimaptr main varnit ghatana ke ghatit hone par beemaa karanevaala ek nishchit dhanrashi beemaa karaanevaale vyakti ko pradaan karata he
 The insurer who pays the occasional interest to the insurer is redeemable by this contract
 'beemaa' shabd farsi se aayaa he jiskaa bhavarth he - 'jimmedaari lenaa'
 Dr
 Raghuveer has translated it as 'agop'
 uskaa angreji paryaay "insurance" he
 Insurance is actually a contract between the insurer and the insured in which the insurer pays a certain sum of money in the event of a certain event in lieu of a certain sum from the insured or compensates the insured for the actual loss of risk
 beemaa ke aadhaar ke bare main sochane par pataa chalata he ki beemaa ek tarah kaa sahyog he jisamen sabhi bimaakrit log, jo jokhim kaa shikaar ho sakate hai, premium adaa karte hai jabaki unamem se sirf kuch ko hi, jo vastav main nuksaan uthaate hai, muaavja diya jaataa he
 In fact, the risk factor is higher but only a few of them are harmed in a given period
 bimakarta bimaakrit pakshon ke nuksaan ko shesh bimaakrit pakshon main baantne kaa kaam karti he
 In gambling or betting, two people make the same agreement that when such an event happens, the other person will pay a certain amount
 lekin use beemaa nahin kaha ja saktaa kyonki swayan us ghatana ke ghatit hone yaa na hone main us baaji lagaanevaale kaa koi swatantra hit nahin hota
 As such, the insurance contract requires the existence of the behemoth along with the elements of the general contract
 udaahranarth k ke jivan kaa beemaa koi ajanabi vyakti kha nahin kara saktaa kyonki k ke jivit rahane yaa na rahane main kha kaa koi swatantra hit nahin he
 But if b is K's wife, it will be the norm for b to insure A's life as A's interest in survival
 beemaa hit kaa arth vyapak he
 The interest of each other in surviving husband and wife is obvious
 karjadaar ke jivan main mahajan kaa hit bhi vaisaa hi maanya he
 Similarly, the owner of that property is insured for property insurance
 yah hit us vyakti ko bhi uplabdh ho jaataa he, jise kisi anubandh ke antargat koi sampatti uplabdh hoti he
 Moreover, mere possession of property, even if it is illegal, makes the behemoth available
 udaahranarth agar kisi divaalie ke paas uske kabje main koi sampatti he, bhale hi vah adhikar swat: gaiyrkanoonee ho kyonki diwaala nikalne ke baad uski sari sampatti par adhikari abhihastankini kaa adhikaar ho jaataa he - kintu us sampatti kaa beemaa karaane ke liye us divaalie ko bhi adhikari maan liya jaataa he
 Both liability or interest can be the basis for the insurance interest arising from a contract
 udaahranarth jab koi vyakti koi makaan kiraye par letaa he to us makaan kii hifaazat kaa koi uttardaayitv us par nahin hota lekin chunki us anubandh se kirayedar ko suraksha kii suvidha upralabdhi hoti he at: us makaan kii suraksha ke bime ke liye bhi us kirayedar ko beemaa hit uplabdh ho jaataa he
 The insurance interest is required for an insurance contract to assess the validity of the said contract, it is also necessary to follow the rules of compensation
 is sambandh main angreji vidhi or bhartiya vidhi main kuch antar he
 According to the English law, the existence of a fire interest is really necessary
 kintu bhartiya vidhi main aisa nahin hai
 According to Section 30 of the Indian Contract Law, since the agreements on gambling or betting etc
 are declared illegal, the insured may not exist in fact but it is sufficient for the validity of the insurance contract even if there is a reasonable basis to provide it
 is
 beemaa anubandh kaa doosraa pramukh aadhaar sadbhaav evam nishkapatata he
 Therefore, it is necessary that both parties disclose all the facts related to insurance
 pragat kar dene kaa arth yahi he ki jaan boojhkar kuch chipaaya na jaae
 If no abstract facts are disclosed, the other party can get rid of the said contract
 is sambandh main bhi angreji or bhartiya vidhi niyamon main kuch antar he
 According to Section 45 of the Indian Insurance Law, if any misrepresentation is made in life insurance unknowingly, intentionally and by want of dishonesty, it is deemed to be excusable
 lekin saamaanya vidhi ke anusaar anjaane main bhi koi galatabayani us anubandh ko prabhavit kar detii he
 Insurance contracts can be divided into two types of categories
 ve anubandh jinamein kshatipurti kaa uttardaayitv hota he or ve jinamein kshatipurti kaa prashn nahin hota varan ek nishchit dhanrashi adaa karne kaa anubandh hota he
 Compensatory insurance can be marine as well as non-core
 pehle kaa udhaaharan samudr dwaara videshon ko bheje janevaale samaan kii suraksha kaa beemaa he or duusare kaa udhaaharan agnibhay athwa motor kaa beemaa he
 In a contract of indemnity only damages are repaid
 yadi ek hi vastu kaa beemaa ek se adhik sthanon main he to bhi beemaa karaanevaale ko kshatipurti kii hi dhanrashi uplabdh hoti he
 Yes, those insurance companies decide a part of the payment amount among themselves
 atah kshatipurti anubandh kaa yah siddhant jivan beemaa tathaa durghatana beemaa par lagu nahin hota
 Therefore, for whatever amount of life insurance and accident insurance has been done, the entire amount is available to the insured or his nominee
 jaisaa kaha ja chukaa he, agni beemaa kshatipurti kaa anubandh he arthath jo dhanrashi bimaptr par ankit he vah avashya mil jaaegi, aisa nahin varan us seemaa tak kshatipurti ho sakegi
 Although a fire insurance contract is only in relation to some property, it is a personal contract, ie the owner of the said property or the person holding an insurance interest in that property is assured of compensation by that contract
 at: agar beemaa karaanevaale ko kis sampatti main swaamitv athwa anya prakaar kaa koi aisa adhikaar nahin he jisase use beemaa hit uplabdh hota ho to vah beemaa kara lene ke baad bhi anubandh kaa laabh nahin uthaa saktaa
 Although the insurance interest is transferred by changing the ownership of the property, the insurance contract is not automatically transferred according to English law
 yadi sampatti vikray ke saath saath tatsambandhi anubandh laabh bhi hastantarit karnaa abhipret ho to bhi beemaa karne vaale kii anumati aavashyak he
 Not so in Indian law
 sthir sampatti hastantaran vidhi kii dhara 49 or 133 ke anusaar koi vipareet anubandh ke abhaav main sampatti praptakarta beemaa anubandh kaa laabh kshatipurti ke liye maang saktaa he
 More than one person may have certain rights in the same item and may have different types of insurance interests
 at: ve sab apane hiton ke aadhaar par us ek kii sampatti par anek bime kara sakate hai
 In order to claim compensation on a fire insurance contract, it is essential that the fire is the proximate cause of the damage, and that the fire is meant to be a spark
 kisi vastu ke atyadhik dabaav ke kaaran vastu kaa jhulas janaa aag laganaa nahin mana jaataa
 The law of the imperative of "sparking" does not apply to any loss of power
 visphot dwaara hui haani agni se haani nahin kehalaati, bhale hi vah visphot agni se hi hua to
 Its basis is that fire should be the proximate cause of loss
 isi prakaar agni lagane se utpann sthiti main kisi tisare paksh dwaara kiye gaye krityon se utpann haani bhi agni haani main shaamil nahin kii jaati
 But the extent of fire or water damage is not determined immediately after the fire is extinguished but only when the said insurance property is handed over to the insurer
 agni beemaa anubandh teen prakaar ke hote hai : In the assessed insurance contract, if the property is completely destroyed, the insured must pay the written amount on the insurance letter
 amoolyankit beemaa anubandh main yadi purna sampatti nasht ho jaae to ukt sampatti kaa moolyankan us samay kiya jaataa he
 The complete and indefinite fire insurance contract does not list the items, but the loss of fire is normally insured
 nirvaarit agni beemaa anambandh main dhanrashi nirdhaarit beemaa patr par likhi rahati he
 Proportional compensation is done in the average fire insurance contract: Restoration, average and partnership principles apply in a fire insurance contract
 jivan beemaa kaa prarambh bhi samudri beemaa ke praaia: saath hi hua kyonki vyapaarik yatra par janevaale poton ke maalikon ko jahaan pot nasht hone kii sambhaavnaaon ke viruddh prabandh karne kii chintaa thi, vahiin un jahaajon ke captainon kaa jivan bhi utana hi moolyawaan tha
 Also, when the artisans' associations started to be established and the rules for extracting the average of the age limit could be established along with the accounts of birth and death, the life insurance contract was also widely spread
 lekin us samay ke beemaa patron kii sharten kaaphi kathin hoti thim
 According to the terms of the life insurance contract before the American Civil War, the insurance letter did not have any surrender value
 bime par koi karj nahin mil saktaa tha
 No extra time was paid to pay insurance interest and insurance was invalidated for suicide, duel or sea voyage
 jivan beemaa do vyaktiyon - beemaa karaanevaale or beemaa karanevaale - ke bich aisa anumbandh he jiske anusaar beemaa karaanevaala nishchit avadhi tak samayik adaayagiyon ke badale ek nishchit dhanrashi praapt karne kaa vachan letaa he or beemaa karaanevaala un nirdhaarit adaayagiyon ke badale ek nishchit rakam nishchit samay par adaa karne kaa vachan detaa he
 The difference between other types of insurance contracts and life insurance contracts is that it is only related to human life and whatever the type or form of the insurance contract, the basic condition is that if the death of the insurer during the life of the contract
 If done, the insured will pay the written amount on the insurance document
 mrityu kaa kaaran keval do sthitiyon main hi is anubandh ko samaapt kar saktaa he
 One, if the insured died by any unlawful act
 do, yadi beemaa karaanevaale kii mrity aise kaarnon se hui ho jinhen bimaptr main baad kar diya gaya he
 There is some difference between English law and Indian law on this subject
 bharat main aatmahatya kaa praytn karnaa to aparaadh he kintu aatmahatya aparaadh nahin he at: aatmahatya karne par aisa hi beemaa anumbandh samaapt kiya ja saktaa he jiske bimaptr main yah shart likhit ho
 In English law, the subject of suicide falls in the first category
 jivan beemaa main milanevaali dhanrashi beemaa karanevaale par karj mana gaya he
 Therefore, it comes under the category of "property" under section three of the property-transfer-method and according to section 130 of the said law, it could be transferred
 ab jivan beemaa kii dhanrashi ke hastantaran kii vyavastha beemaa vidhi kii dhara 38 va 39 main kii gai he
 Transfer of the said amount can also be done by way of nomination and also by nomination
 abhihastankan main beemaa karaanevaala us beemaa anubandh se utpann apan adhikaron evam hiton ko duusare ko hastantarit kar detaa he
 Nomination simply means that if the nominee is alive on the death of the insurer, then the sum of insurance is available to him
 namakan bina soochna ke badla ja saktaa he
 If the nominee dies earlier, then the insurer gets the right to get the money again
 abhihastankan main aisa nahin he
 Once the rights of an insurance contract are assigned, a second assignment cannot be done without its prior permission
 yadi beemaa karaanevaale ke pehle abhihastankit kii mrityu ho jaae to ve adhikaar beemaa karaanevaale ko waapas nahin milte varan us mrit vyakti ke uttaradhikariyon ko uplabdh ho jate hai
 There are two types of circumstances under the contract - vyaktiyon kaa jivan anek prakaar kii anischitataaon evam jokhimon se ghira hua he
 If he has some property related risks, then sometimes there is a risk to life, so the idea that he should get protection against these risks has made insurance a necessity
 vartmaan audyogic vikaas kaa aadhaar hi pratyaksh va paroksh rup se yadi beemaa ko kaha jaay to koi atishyokti nahi hogi
 Insurance has become an urgent need to relieve stress in human life
 nimna binduon ke aadhaar par beemaa kii aavashyaktaa kaa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he- With the development of civilization, the importance of insurance is also increasing, because the risks, accidents and uncertainties are increasing, today we cannot imagine any country which is not availing insurance
 aaj beemaa praarambhik swaroop se hat kar saamaajik va vyavsaayik jagat ke prayek kshetra main padaarpan kar chukaa he or apni upyogita ke aadhaar par lokapriyata praapt karata ja rahaa he
 Impressed by the usefulness of insurance, the British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill said, "if i am in control, i should inscribe door-to-door to insure
 ” Insurance provides social and economic benefits to the entire human race and all the sections related to it
 sankshep main kah sakate he ki aadhunik yug main beemaa kaa mahatv din duguna raat chauguna hota chalaa ja rahaa he
 The importance or benefits of insurance can be understood by the following classification
 beemaa se vyashti str par nimna laabh ho sakate hai
 1
 Encourage Economy and Savings - By insuring the person is worried about depositing interest, he starts saving and adopting economy from the very beginning
 pro
 reagal, miller tathaa williams ke anusaar - “'beemaa bachat ko protsaahan de ne vaala vaataavaran pradaan karata he
 "if he has not paid the premium, he can also waste that money
 prati varsh bachat yojana ke antargat karodon rou
 kaa premium jamaa hota he, jo bachat kii aadat se hi sambhav he
 2
 Protection from risks - Not only human life but also business is full of risks, insurance removes those uncertainties
 pro
 anje l ke anusaar- beemaa anishchit haniyon se suraksha kaa sthaayee aadhaar he
 Business and industry have developed due to insurance and the risk posed to the employment of the person also ends
 ” 3
 Appropriation- Appropriation element is also present in life insurance
 vyakti jo raashi premium ke rup main jamaa karwaata he
 She is his savings
 nishchit avadhi ke purna hone athwa nishchit ghatana ke ghatit hone par bimit ko athwa uske uttaradhikariyon ko nishchit raashi praapt ho jaati he
 Thus insurance becomes a means of protection for the individual as well as a form of appropriation
 4
 bimit va uske uttaradhikariyon ko purna suraksha - beemaa karaane se bimit va uske uttaradhikariyon ko purna vaidhanik suraksha praapt hoti he
 Before the death of the insured, the nominee can nominate the name of the intended person, so that the family money, partition related disputes can be overcome and the heirs also remain completely safe
 5
 karon main chhu t - beemaa se karon main bhi chhu t milti he
 Income tax can be obtained on the amount of premium paid in India
 isi prakaar smapda kar main bhi chhu t milti he
 6
 Capitalization of income potential: - Through insurance, a person can also capitalize his income potential
 vah bhavishya main uske dwaara kamaayi ja sakane vaali raashi kaa bhi beemaa karvaa kar apni aay kaa puunjikaran kar saktaa he
 Even if the insured dies or the performance is terminated, the same amount will be available on the insurance plan
 7
 saakh suvidhaain - rindaata aise vyaktiyon ko rin de naa adhik pasand karte hai jinka, beemaa karavaaya hu aa he
 Financial institutions also do not want to give loans to the insured person
 iske atirikt beemaa company se bhi saakh suvidhaayen praapt kii ja sakati he
 8
 Freedom from Statutory Obligations - a person can get rid of his obligations to third parties by insuring statutory liability
 nishchit premium ke badale beemaa company un dayitvon kaa bhugtan kare gi
 9
 Increased efficiency - Uncertainty is the biggest concern in life and insurance protects the individuals from that uncertainty
 vyakti jab chintaa mukt hokar kaary karata he to purna ekaagratha se kaary karne main samarth ho paata he, jisase uski kaaryakshmata main vruddhi hoti he
 10
 Mental peace - When a person is free from uncertainties, he works with a happy mind
 use mrityu ke pashchaat utpann hone vaale dayitvon kii bhi chintaa nahin rahati he kyonki vah vartmaan main hi unka beemaa kara chukaa hota he
 11
 Promotion of self-reliance - a feeling of economic self-reliance arises in the insured
 vyakti jivit avasthaa main bhi rin aasaani se praapt kar saktaa he or mrityu ke pashchaat bhi ashrith parivaar ko beemaa dhan raashi milane se aarthik aatmanirbharta praapt hoti he
 12
 Planning for future requirements - Many types of insurance papers like education, marriage, pension etc
 are issued by the insurance company
 vyakti apni simit aay main se vartmaan main hi bhavishya kii taiyaari kar le ta he ki use kab, kis aavashyaktaa par, kitni raashi kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 On this basis, he can be successful in selecting those special insurances, even after his death, he can fulfill the needs of the family in a planned manner
 13
 satarkta ko protsaahan - beemaa companiyaan haniyon se bachane ke kai surakshatmak suzav de ti rahati he
 These protective measures make human life more secure
 He takes measures to avoid various diseases from time to time
 kshatipurak biimon main satarkta upaay apnaane va saamaanya ausat se kam daata prastut karne par premium main chhu t bhi pradaan kii jaati he jo annat: beemaa laagat ko kam karti he
 14
 Increase in social prestige and self-respect - Insurance increases the self-esteem and prestige of a person in society
 jin logon kaa beemaa hota he samaaj unhe adhik surakshit samaj kar sammaan karata he, musiibat ke samay unhen dusron kii ore nahin de khana padataa he, ve aasaani se beemaa patr par rin bhi praapt kar sakate he
 15
 Support in old age: - At present, while joint family practice is disappearing, the insurance person is getting support for old age
 vriddhavastha me aay ke strot simit ho jate hai va uttardaayitv bad jate he, aise main beemaa se praapt dhan hi uskaa pramukh sahaara banataa he
 The imagination of the current economic world is incomplete without insurance
 vyavsaayee beemaa karwaane kii rupare kha bana le ta he taaki vah purna shaanti va tanmayata ke saath vyavsaayik kriyaaon ko puraa kar sake
 According to eminent management thinker Peter F
 Drucker - "it is not an exaggeration to say that an industrial economy cannot do anything without insurance
 ” vaastavik sthiti yahi he ki beemaa vyavsaay ke safal sanchaalan ke liye aprihaary he
 Economically, the importance of insurance is visible as follows: 1
 bachaton ko protsaahan - beemaa anivaary bachat kaa ek saadhan he
 Insurance encourages people to make small savings
 choti si premium ke dwaara vah bhavishya ke kai bade sapanom ko aasaani se puraa kar saktaa he
 The insurance company receives a premium amount of crores of rupees from the small savings of these insured, which accumulates to become a hefty sum of money
 jinhen beemaa company aavashyak kharchon kii purti ke pashchaat saamaajik va rashtriya hit kii yojanaon main viniyog kar de ti he
 2
 Capital formation - When the insurance company appropriates the amount of interest received from the insured in various national schemes, the business and business get capital easily from it, and many people also get employment
 3
