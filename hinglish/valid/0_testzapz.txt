 Here the business of pepper oil is also gathering its roots
 Bilari's business is mainly dominated by Kumaratanaya Vaishyas, Ansaris
 The major produce of the area is sugarcane
 Earlier cotton was grown on most of the area
 All its consumption was in the cotton mill of Chandausi, a city located just 19 km from here
 This cotton industry, in this region, was put to waste by mixing sugar
 Due to setting up of a sugar mill in Bilari, the area of cotton growing continued to decrease and the cotton mill of Chandausi was finally closed
 Established in the nearby village of Dhakia Naru, the ownership of this sole Ajudhya sugar mill, ever since Seth Shaadi Lal has passed into the hands of others, has been the sugarcane producing farmer of the region every year, Sanyukt Sangharsh Samiti, Kisan Sangharsh Samiti , Indian Farmer's Union, In the representation of Bilari and later Bharatiya Kisan Union, for the outstanding cane price of crores of rupees, they have been fighting with the governments of all political parties till now in peaceful and democratic ways
 Due to the sugarcane growers not getting their sugarcane price every year for many decades, the local business of the city Bilari are getting stalled
 For this reason, hundreds of farmers of the region are forced to sell their lands in the vicious cycle of usurers and sell their land in the hands of those nobles

 vishisht arthon main chand kavita yaa geet main varnon kii sankhya or sthaan se sambandhit niyamon ko kehete hai jinase kavy main lay or ranjaktaa aati he
 Small-scale sounds, in the order of minor-master utterances, give the volume and when in a poetic composition they harmonize with an arrangement, it is given a classical name and according to the small-master volumes this letter The system starts with a specific name called Chanda, like Chaupai, Doha, Arya, Indravajra, Gayatri Chanda etc
 is prakaar kii vyavastha main maatra athwa varnon kii sankhya, viraam, gati, lay tathaa tuk aadi ke niyamon ko bhi nirdhaarit kiya gaya he jinka paalan kavi ko karnaa hota he
 In this second sense it is equivalent to the meter of English or to the ruckus of Urdu Persian
 hindi sahitya main bhi paramparaagat rachanaayen chand ke in niyamon kaa paalan karte hue rachi jaati thim, yani kisi na kisi chand main hoti thim
 In other languages of the world also, there are traditionally rules for poetry
 chhandon kii rachana or gun-avagun ke adhyayan ko chhandashastra kehete hai
 Since 'chhandashastra', composed by Acharya Pingal, is the oldest available text, this scripture is also called Pingal Shastra
 pracheen kaal ke granthon main sanskrit main kai prakaar ke chand milte hai jo vaidic kaal ke jitne pracheen hai
 The verses of the Vedas are also chanted
 pingal dwaara rachit chhandashastra is vishay kaa mul granth he
 The verse is first discussed in the Rigveda
 yadi gadhy kii kasuti ‘vyakaran’ he to kavita kii kasuti ‘chhandashastra’ he
 Proper knowledge of the design is not without knowledge of the scriptures
 kavy ore chand ke prarambh main ‘agan’ arthath ‘ashubh gana’ nahin aana chahie
 The phrase employed with specific rules related to the number and order of the letters used in the sentence, quantity-calculation and Yeti-speed is called "chhand"
 chhandas shabd 'chad' dhaatu se bana he
 It has a metallic etymological meaning - 'one who walks on his own will'
 isi mul se svachhand jaise shabd aae hai
 Therefore, at the root of the word stanza is the sense of motion
 kisi vaaiumay kii samgr saamagree kaa naam sahitya he
 The Rigveda is the oldest of the literature found in the world
 rugveda kii rachana chandobaddh hi he
 This is a proof that even at that time, verses were used for art and special statement
 chand ko padya rachana kaa maapdand kaha ja saktaa he
 The verse plan cannot be realized in poetry without difficult practice
 chand ke nimnlikhit ang hote hai - a formula has been devised to memorize the ganas easily - Yamatarajbhansalaga
 sutara ke pehle aath varnon main aath ganon ke naam hai
 The last two letters 'L' and 'C' are the letters of the scripture
 jis gana kii matraaon kaa swaroop jaananaa ho uske aage ke do aksharon ko is sutara se le len jaise ‘magan’ kaa swaroop jaanane ke liye ‘maa’ tathaa uske aage ke do akshar- ‘ta raa’ = matara 
 The idea of 'gan' is only in the letter circle, mere verses are free from this bondage

 Each of its phases has 24 quantities
 udhaaharan - Soratha Ardhsam is a mere stanza and it is exactly the reverse of Doha
 iske visham charnon charan main 11-11 matraayen or sam charnon charan main 13-13 matraayen hoti hai

 ganit main sam aisi sankhyaon ko kaha jaataa he jo 2 dwaara purnatah vibhajya hon, jaise ki 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ityadi
 Another way of saying this is that all even numbers are multiples of 2
 is se vipareet visham ank aise ankon ko kaha jaataa he, jo 2 dwaara vibhajya nahin hote, jaise 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, aadi
 Although the concept of even-odd was originally applied to digits, in modern mathematics it is also applied to other things
 kisi chiz kii ganitiya samta uskaa vah lakshan hoti he jo yah batalaaye ki vah sam he yaa visham
 If a number is even, its last digit is also the same and similarly the last digit of an odd number can also be odd
 udhaaharan ke liye 12,34,347 ko agar 2 se vibhajit kiya jaae to yah visham paaya jayega or yah iske antim ank ko dekhakar bina koi vibhaajan kare turant hi bataaya ja saktaa he kyonki 7 swayan ek visham ank he

 When the education of Pandava and Kaurava princes was completed, they wanted to give Guru Dakshina to Dronacharya
 dronacharya ko drupad ke dwaara kiye gayi apane apmaan kaa samaran ho aayaa or unhone rajkumaron se kaha, "rajkumaron! yadi tum gurudakshina dena hi chaahate ho to paanchal naresh drupad ko bandi bana kar mere samaksh prastut karo

 " gurudev ke is prakaar kehane par samast rajkumaar apane-apane astr-shastr le kar paanchal desh kii ore chale

 The king-maharaja and Prince of many countries were present in the Swayamvara Sabha, soon after, Princess Draupadi arrived in that meeting with her brother Dhrishtadyumna in hand
 dhridhyumna ne sabha ko sambodhit karte huye kaha, "vibhinn desh se padhaare raja-maharaajaaon evam anya ganmaanya jano se meri bahan draupadi kaa vivaah hoga

 a fierce battle ensued between the Pandavas and the Kshatriya kings
 pandav draupadi ko saath le kar vahaan pahunche jahaan ve apni mata kunti ke saath nivas kar rahe the
 Arjun called out from the gate and said to his mother, "mother! Today we have come with a wonderful begging for you
 " us par kunti ne bheetar se hi kaha, "putron! tum log aapas main mil-baant uskaa upbhog kar lo
 "later on knowing that the beggar was in the form of a bride, Kunti was deeply repentant but Draupadi accepted the five Pandavas as her husband to prove the mother's words to be true
 pandavon ke draupadi ko saath le kar apane nivas par pahunchne ke kuch kaal pashchaat unke peeche-peeche krishna bhi vahaan par aa pahunche
 After the formalities were completed, Kunti said to Draupadi, "draupadi! First take out the parts of the gods
 phir brahmanon ko do
 Then separate the fraction of dependents
 uske baad jo shesh bache uskaa aadha bhaag bhim ko or shesh aadha bhaag ham sabhi ko apni deh paroso

 Maharishi Bhrigu started the Dadri Mela in honor of his disciple Dardar with the preservation and sacrificial tradition of the river Ganges on the occasion of the inauguration of the astrological treatise 'bhrigu Samhita' composed by Maharishi Bhrigu and the confluence of Ganga Sarayu rivers
 maharishi bhrigu kii do patniyon kaa ullekh aarsh granthon main miltaa he

 Now Bhargava Ritchik also came to Gadhipuri, South of Himalayas
 maharishi bhrigu ke is vimukt kshetra main aane ke kai kathanak aarsh granthon main milte hai
 According to mythological, historical accounts, brahma-pracheta son Bhrigu was engendering the ethnics of Gandharva, the Yaksha castes of the north of the Himalayas, by establishing matrimonial relations with the Himalayan south demons, demons and kings of human beings
 jisase sabhi log devon ke sangrakshak, brahmaji ke sabase chote bhai vishnu ko dosha de rahe the
 The dominance of the Bhargavas was increasing in the second twelve Adityas
 isi bich maharishi bhrigu ke shvasur daityaraj hiranyakashyap ne himalay ke uttar ke rajyon par chadhaai kar diya
 Due to which there was a dispute in Maharishi Bhrigu's family
 maharishi bhrigu yah kah kar ki rajya seemaa kaa vistaar karnaa raja kaa dharm he, apane shvasur kaa paksh le rahe the
 In this dispute, Vishnu killed his first wife, Divya Devi, the daughter of Hiranyakashyap
 jisase krodhit hokar maharishi bhrigu ne shri vishnu ji ko ek laat maar diya
 The dispute was settled by Maharishi Bhrigu's great-grandfather and Vishnu ji's grandfather Marichi Muni with the decision that Bhrigu should go south of the Himalayas
 unke divya devi se utpann putron ko sammaan sahit paalan-poshan kii jimmedaari devgan uthaayenge
 In order to protect the dignity and dignity of the family, Bhrigu ji also received orders that he would not criticize Shri Hari Vishnu
 is prakaar maharishi bhrigu sushanagar se apni duusari patni paulami ko saath lekar apane chote putr richik ke paas gadhipuri aa gayi
 The second story of Maharishi Bhrigu coming to this region is found in some religious texts, Puranas

 From whom his two sons kavya-venus and Tvashta and a daughter 'sri' Lakshmi were born

 In the Devasur struggle with the demons, Maharishi Bhrigu's wife Khyati, who was a stunning woman with full power
 daityon kii sena ke mritak sainikon ko vah apane yogabal se jivit kar detii thi
 Enraged, Shrihari Vishnu cut the head of Shukracharya's mother, Bhriguji's wife Khyati, from his Sudarshan Chakra
 apni patni kii hatya hone kii jaankaree hone par maharishi bhrigu bhagwaan vishnu ko shaap dete hai ki tumhen stri ke pet se baar-baar janm lenaa padegaa
 After that Maharishi resurrects his wife Khyati with his yogic power and comes to the banks of the Ganges, creating the Tamsa River
 padam puraana ke upsanhaar khand kii katha ke anusaar mandarachal parvat ho rahe yajna main rishi-muniyon main is baat par vivaad chhid gaya ki tridevon main shreshth dev koun he?devon kii pariksha ke liye rishi-muniyon ne maharishi bhrigu ko pareekshak niyukt kiya
 Maharishi Bhrigu first reached Kailash of Lord Shankar at the time of taking the examination of the trinity
 At that time Lord Shankar was doing Vihara with his wife Sati
 nandi aadi rudraganon ne maharishi ko pravesh dwaar par hi roak diya
 The Rudras also humiliated the Maharshi by his stubbornness to meet Lord Shankar
 kupit maharishi bhrigu ne bhagwaan shankar ko tamoguni ghoshit karte hue ling main poojit hone kaa shaap diya
 From here Maharishi Bhrigu reached Brahmaloka Brahma
 brahmaji apane darbar main viraaj rahe the
 All the gods were sitting in front of him
 bhrigu ji ko brahmaji ne baithne tak ko nahin kahe
 Then Maharishi Bhrigu declared Brahma as Rajoguni and cursed him to be invincible
 kailash or brahmalok main mili apmaan-tiraskaar se kshubhit maharishi vishnulok chal diye
 Lord Srihari Vishnu was staying in the Ksheer Sagar with his wife lakshmi-shree on a beautiful beautiful boat
 us samay shri vishnu ji shayan kar rahe the
 Maharishi Bhriguji felt that seeing us coming, Vishnu is pretending to sleep
 unhone apane daahine pair kaa aghat shri vishnu ji kii chaati par kar diya
 Vishnupriya Lakshmi, who was pressing the feet of Srihari, was enraged at this rude behavior of Maharishi
 lekin vishnu ji ne maharishi kaa pair pakad liya or kaha bhagwan ! mere kathor vaksh se aapke komal charan main chot to nahin lagi
 Maharishi Bhrigu was ashamed and also pleased, he declared Srihari Vishnu as the best Satoguni among the trinity
 tridevon kii is pariksha main jahaan ek bahut badi sikh chhipi he
 a huge diplomacy was also hidden there
 is ghatana se ek lokokti bani
 Forgiveness is the need for suffering kaa hari ko ghatyo gaye, jyon bhrigu maari laat
 
 is ghatana main kootneeti yah thi ki himalay ke uttar ke nrivanshon kaa sanghathan banaakar rahane se shri hari vishnu ke netritv main sabhi jatiyaan sabhy, susanskrit ban unnati kar rahi thi
 The ethnical community of the south of the Himalayas, which were known by the names of demon-demon, marut-rudra, etc
 parishramee hone ke baad bhi asangathit, asabhy jivan ji rahi thi
 These castes considered Rudra Shankar as their hero-god
 unki hi puja karti thi
 Maharishi Bhrigu was the most suitable medium to enshrine the Devakula hero Srivishnu in the south of the Himalayas
 unki ek patni daityakul se thi, to duusari daanav kul se thi or unke putron shukraachaaryon, twashta-may-vishwakarma tathaa bhrigukachha main chyavan tathaa gadhipuri main richik kaa bahut maan-sammaan tha
 After this Tridev examination, the reputation of Srihari Vishnu began to be established in the south of Himalayas
 vishesh rup se raajaaon ke abhishek main shri vishnu kaa naam lenaa himalay parsy devon kii krupa prapti or manyata milanaa mana jane laga
 According to the legend mentioned in the Puranas, Maharishi Bhrigu, who attacked Vishnu's chest in the examination of the three gods, was punished by the sage Dandacharya Marichi
 jiske liye bhriguji ko ek sookhe baans kii chadi main konpale foot pade or aapke qamar se mrigchaal prithvi par gir pade
 You will chant the name Vishnu Sahastra then you will have redemption of this sin
 mandarachal se chalate hue jab maharishi bhrigu vimukt kshetra ke ganga tat par pahunche to unki mrigchaal gir padi or chadi main konpale foot padi
 Where he started doing penance
 kaalaantar main yah bhu-bhaag maharishi ke naam se bhrigukshetra kaha jane laga
 My direct intention is that readers can use their discretion to throw light on all the historical, mythological and religious aspects related to Maharishi Bhrigu life
 hamaare dharmik granthon main hamaare manishiyon ke varnan to prachur he, parantu usee prachurtaa se usamen kalpit ghatnaon ko bhi joda gaya he
 In order to glorify their lives, our Patividvans have played with their historicity, due to which a number of humiliating situations arise at the global level
 maharishi bhrigu ne is bhu-bhaag par aane ke baad yahan ke jangalon ko saaf karaayaa
 Here only the people living on the shelves of animals were taught to do farming
 yahan gurukul kii sthapana karke logon ko padhanaa-likhnaa sikhaaya
 In that period, this land was considered to be the abode of cannibal humans
 unhen sabhy, susanskrit maanav banaanen kaa kaary maharishi dwaara kiya gaya
 Those unfamiliar with the family life of Maharishi Bhrigu also know about Bhrigu Samhita, the great book of astrology-astronomy published by Maharishi
 is naam se anek pustake aaj bhi sahitya vikritaon ke yaha bikati hui dikhaai detii he
 Maharishi had composed the Bhrigu Samhita Granth in his long-term residence Karma Bhumi-free Bhumi Ballia
 is sandarbh do baaten dhyaan dene kii he
 The first thing is that during his time in his native land Brahmalok, his life was full of trouble
 apni patni divya devi kii mrityu se vyathit or tridevon kii pariksha ke uparant janm bhoomi se nishkasit maharishi ko usee samay shaanti se jivan vyateet karne kaa avasar mila jab vah vimukt bhoomi main aaye
 By the time Bhrigukchha arrived in Gujarat, his fame had spread all around
 kyonki us samay tak unke bhrigu samhita ko bhi prasiddhi mil chuki thi or unke shishy darder dwaara bhrigukshtra main ganga-sarayu ke sangam karaane kii baat bhi puraa aryavart jaan chukaa tha
 According to the legend, the Maharishi was greeted by royalty upon his arrival in the Gulf of Khambhat, and the Vedic scholar Brahmins, while reciting him, praised him as the luminous priest of astrological astrology
 jisase yah baat pramanit hoti he ki maharishi dwaara bhrigu samhita kii rachana sushanagar se nishkasana ke baad or gujarat ke bhrigukachha jane se rpurv kii gai thi
 The result of three births of any person can be extracted by this Samhita of Maharishi
 is brahmand ko niyantrit karne vaale surya, chandramaa, mangal, buddha, brihaspati,shukr shani aadi grahon or nakshatron par aadhaarit vaidic ganit ke is vaigyanik granth ke madhyam se jivan or krishi ke liye varsha aadi kii bhi bhavishyavaaniyan kii jaati thi
 Paper and printing facilities were not available in Maharishi's period
 richaon ko kanthsth karaayaa jaataa tha or isaki vyavhaarik jaankaree shalakaon ke madhyam se shishyon ko di jaati thi
 Later, when the method of writing evolved and its resources like bhojpatra tadpatra etc
, some scholars did the work of writing these verses

 Pal Empire harsh ke samay ke baad se uttari bharat ke prabhutv kaa pratik kannauj mana jaataa tha
 Later this place was acquired by Delhi
 paal samrajya kii neenv 750 i
 main 'gopal' naamak raja ne daali
 It is said that some prominent people chose him as the king to suppress the unrest in the region
 is prakaar raja kaa nirvachan ek abhootpurv ghatana thi
 This probably means that Gopal was able to get the support of all the important people of that region and this helped him a lot to strengthen his position
 paal vansh kaa sabase bada samraat 'gopal' kaa putr 'dharmpal' tha
 It reigned from 770 to 810 AD
 kannauj ke prabhutv ke liye sangharsh isi ke shasankaal main armbh hua
 It was the belief of the rulers of this time that the ruler of Kannauj would be accepted as the emperor of the whole of northern India
 kannauj par niyantran kaa arth yah bhi thi ki us shaasha kaa, upree ganga ghati or uske vishaal prakritik sadhano par bhi niyantran ho jayega
 The first Pratihara ruler 'vatsaraja' defeated Dharmapala and gained control over Kannauj
 par isi samay rashtrakut samraat 'dhruv', jo gujarat or malwa par prabhutv ke liye pratihaaron se sangharsh kar rahaa tha, usne uttari bharat par dhaava bol diya
 After much preparation, he crossed the Narmada and defeated Vatsaraja in a battle near modern Jhansi
 iske baad usne aage badhkar ganga ghati main dharmpal ko haraaya
 After these victories, this Rashtrakuta emperor returned to the South in 790
 aisa lagata he ki kannauj par adhikaar praapt karne kii isaki koi vishesh ichha nahin thi or ye keval gujarat or malwa ko apane adheen karne ke liye pratihaaron kii shakti ko samaapt kar dena chahta tha
 He was successful in both his goals
 udhar pratihaaron ke kamazor padane se dharmpal ko bhi laabh pahunchaa
 He rose quickly from his defeat and placed one of his men on the throne of Kannauj
 yahan usne ek vishaal darbar kaa aayojan kiya
 In which several small kings from the surrounding areas participated
 inamen gandhar, madra, purvi rajasthan tathaa malwa ke raja shaamil the
 Thus Dharmapala can be called Uttapathaswamin in the true sense
 pratihaar samrajya ko isse bada dhakka laga or rashtrakooton dwaara parajeet hone ke baad vatsaraj kaa naam bhi nahin suna jaataa
 Table of contents in teenon samrajyon ke bich qareeb 200 saal tak aapasi sangharsh chalaa
 Once again, for the dominion of Kannauj, Dharmapala had to fight against Pratihara Emperor 'nagabhatta' II
 gwalior ke nikat ek abhilekh mila he, jo nagabhatta kii mrityu ke 50 varshon baad likhaa gaya or jisamen uski vijay kii charchaa kii gai he
 It states that Nagabhatta II conquered Malwa and parts of central India and defeated 'turuska and Sandhav' who were probably the Arab rulers and their Turkish soldiers in Sindh
 usne bang samraat ko, jo shaayad dharmpal tha, ko bhi parajeet kiya or use munger tak khaded diya
 But once again Rashtrakutas came in the middle
 rashtrakut samraat govind tritiy ne uttari bharat main apane pair rakhe or nagabhatta dwitiya ko peeche hatana padaa
 Govind III defeated him in a battle near Bundelkhand
 lekin ek baar punah rashtrakut samraat malwa or gujarat par adhikaar praapt karne ke baad waapas dakshin laut aayaa
 These events occurred around 806 to 870 AD
 jab paal shaasha kannauj tathaa upree ganga ghati par apana prabhutv qaayam karne main asafal hue, to unhone anya kshetron kii taraf apana dhyaan diya
 Devpal's son Devpal, who ascended the throne in 810 AD and ruled for 40 years, established his influence in Pragjyotishpur and some areas of Orissa

 The Pala empire disintegrated after the death of Devpal

 According to Arab businessman Suleman 1 arab vyapaaree suleman ke anusaar :-paal vansh ke armbh ke shaskaon ne aathvin shatabdi ke madhya se lekar dasvin shatabdi ke madhya, arthath qareeb 200 varshon tak uttari bharat ke purvi kshetron par apana prabhutv qaayam rakhaa
 Suleman, an Arab businessman who visited India in the middle of the tenth century, has discussed the power and prosperity of the Pala empire
 usne paal rajya ko 'ruhamaa' kahkar pukaara he or kaha he ki paal shaasha or uske padosi rajyon, pratihaaron or rashtrakooton main ladaai chalati rahati thi, lekin paal shashan kii sena uske donon shatruon kii senaaon se badi thi
 Suleman has stated that the Pal ruler used to go to war with 50 thousand elephants and 10 to 15 thousand men were appointed only to wash the clothes of his soldiers
 isse uski sena kaa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 We also know of the Pala dynasty from Tibetan texts, although it was written in the seventeenth century
 inke anusaar paal shaasha buddha dharm tathaa gyaan ko sangrakshan or badhaava dete the
 To Nalanda University, which is famous in the entire eastern region, Dharmapala revived and donated 200 villages for his expenses

 He asked the Pal ruler Devpal for a grant of five villages for the expenses of this monastery
 devpal ne uskaa yah anurodh sweekaar kar liya
 This tells us about the close relationship between these two
