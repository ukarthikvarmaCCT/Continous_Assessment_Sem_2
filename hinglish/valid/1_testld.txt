 landow-ramanujan sthirankaramanujan-sholdener sthirankaramanujan theta falnarogers-ramanujan tatsamakaramanujan abhajyakrutrim theta falanbus Srinivasa Ramanujan Iyengar was a great Indian mathematician
 inhen aadhunik kaal ke mahanatam ganit vichaarkon main gina jaataa he
 He did not get any special training in mathematics, yet he made deep contributions in the areas of analysis and number theory
 inhone apane pratibha or lagan se na keval ganit ke kshetra main adbhut avishkaar kiye varan bharat ko athulaneey gaurav bhi pradaan kiya
 He was a brilliant genius since childhood
 inhone khud se ganit siikhaa or apane jeevanabhar main ganit ke 3,884 pramayon kaa sankalan kiya
 Most of these theorems have been proved correct
 inhone ganit ke sahaj gyaan or bijganit prakalan kii adwitiya pratibha ke bal par bahut se moulik or aparmparik parinaam nikaale jinase prerit shodh aaj tak ho rahaa he, yadhyapi inaki kuch khojon ko ganit mukhyadhara main ab tak nahin apanaaya gaya he
 Recently their formulas have been used in crystal science
 inke kaary se prabhavit ganit ke kshetron main ho rahe kaam ke liye ramanujan jarnal kii sthapana kii gai he
 Ramanujan was born on 22 December 1887 in the village of Erode, Coimbatore, in the southern part of India
 vah paaramparik brahman parivaar main janme the
 His mother's name was Komaltammal and his father's name was Srinivasa Iyengar
 inkaa bachapan mukhyatah kumbhakonam main beetaa tha jo ki apane pracheen mandiron ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Ramanujan's intellectual development in childhood was not like that of ordinary children
 yah teen varsh kii aayu tak bolnaa bhi nahin sikh paae the
 When Ramanujan did not start speaking till such a great age, everyone was worried that he would be dumb
 baad ke varshon main jab unhone vidhyalay main pravesh liya to bhi paaramparik shiksha main inkaa kabhi bhi man nahin laga
 Ramanujan attained the highest marks in the entire district in the primary examination at the age of ten and reached the town high school for further education
 ramanujan ko prashn poochna bahut pasand tha
 His questions sometimes seemed very strange to the teachers
 jaise ki-sansar main pehla purush koun tha? prithvi or badalon ke bich kii duuri kitni hoti he? ramanujan kaa vyavhaar bada hi madhur tha
 His somewhat more gross body and glowing eyes of curiosity gave him a different identity
 inke sahpaathiyon ke anusaar inkaa vyavhaar itnaa saumy tha ki koi inase naaraaz ho hi nahin saktaa tha
 His talent in the school started making a mark on other students and teachers
 inhone skool ke samay main hi kalege ke str ke ganit ko pard liya tha
 Once the headmaster of his school had also said that the criteria for examinations to be held in the school does not apply to Ramanujan
 hiskool kii pariksha uteern karne ke baad inhen ganit or angreji me achche ank laane ke kaaran subramanyam chaatravrutti mili or aage kalege kii shiksha ke liye pravesh bhi mila
 a further problem occurred
 ramanujan kaa ganit ke prati prem itnaa bad gaya tha ki ve duusare vishyon par dhyaan hi nahin dete the
 He used to solve mathematics questions even in history, biology classes
 nateeja yah hua ki gyarahavin kaksha kii pariksha main ve ganit ko chhod kar baaki sabhi vishyon main fail ho gaye or parinamswaroop unako chaatravrutti milani band ho gai
 One, the financial condition of the house was poor and scholarship was not being received from above
 ramanujan ke liye yah bada hi kathin samay tha
 He also did some maths tuition and ledger work to improve the condition of the house
 kuch samay baad 1907 main ramanujan ne phir se barahavin kaksha kii privet pariksha di or anuteern ho gaye
 And with this, their traditional education was celebrated
 vidhyalay chhodane ke baad kaa paanch varshon kaa samay inke liye bahut hataasha bharaa tha
 At this time India was caught in the shackles of subordination
 chaaron taraf bhayankar garibi thi
 At such a time, Ramanujan had neither a job nor an opportunity to work with any institute or professor
 bas unka ishwar par atoot vishwaas or ganit ke prati agaadh shraddha ne unhen kartavya maarg par chalane ke liye sadaiv prerit kiya
 Namgiri Devi was the Ishta Devi of Ramanujan's family
 unke prati atoot vishwaas ne unhen kahin rukne nahin diya or ve itani vipareet paristhitiyon main bhi ganit ke apane shodh ko chalaate rahe
 At this time Ramanujan used to get a total of five rupees monthly from tuition and lived in it
 ramanujan kaa yah jivan kaal bahut ksht or dukh se bharaa tha
 He always had to wander around to maintain his education and continue his education and had to plead unsuccessfully to many people
 varsh 1908 main inke mata pita ne inkaa vivaah janaki naamak kanya se kar diya
 After marriage, it was no longer possible for them to forget everything and drown in mathematics
 atah ve naukari kii talash main madras aae
 He did not get a job due to not passing the XII examination and his health also fell badly
 ab doctor kii salaah par inhen waapas apane ghar kumbhakonam lautnaa padaa
 After recovering from illness, he came back to Madras and started looking for a job again
 ye jab bhi kisi se milte the to use apana ek register dikhaate the
 This register contained all the work done by him in mathematics
 isi samay kisi ke kehane par ramanujan vahaan ke dipti colector shri ve
 ramasvami ayyar se mili
 Iyer was a great scholar of mathematics
 yahaan par shri ayyar ne ramanujan kii pratibha ko pahachaanaa or jiladhikari shri ramchandra raav se kah kar inke liye 25 rupaye masik chaatravrutti kaa prabandh bhi kar diya
 On this instinct, Ramanujan published his first research paper in Madras for a year
 shodh patr kaa sheershak tha "barnauli sankhyaon ke kuch gun” or yah shodh patr jarnal of indian mathematical socity main prakashit hua tha
 After completing one year here, he worked as a clerk in Madras Port Trust
 saubhaahgya se is naukari main kaam kaa boj kuch zyada nahin tha or yahaan inhen apane ganit ke liye paryaapt samay miltaa tha
 Here Ramanujan used to stay awake all night and write new mathematical formulas and then take a rest for a while and then leave for office
 ramanujan ganit ke shodhon ko slate par likhte the
 And later wrote it down in a register
 raat ko ramanujan ke slate or khadie kii aawaaj ke kaaran parivaar ke anya sadasyon kii neend chaupat ho jaati thi
 At this time there was a great distance between Indian and Western living and due to this Indians were generally very hesitant to present their things to the British scientists
 idhar sthiti kuch aisi thi ki bina kisi angrej ganitagya kii sahaayta liye shodh kaary ko aage nahin badhaayaa ja saktaa tha
 At this time Ramanujan's old well wishers came to his work and these people sent the work done by Ramanujan to the famous mathematicians of London
 par yahaan inhen kuch vishesh sahaayta nahin mili lekin ek laabh yah hua ki log ramanujan ko thodaa bahut jaanane lage the
 At the same time, Ramanujan showed some formulas of his number theory to Professor Seshu Iyer, then he turned his attention to Professor Hardy of London
 professor hardi us samay ke vishwa ke prasiddh ganitagyon main se ek the
 And was known for his strict nature and discipline
 professor hardi ke shodhakarya ko padhane ke baad ramanujan ne bataaya ki unhone professor hardi ke anuttarit prashn kaa uttar khoj nikaala he
 Now Ramanujan's correspondence with Professor Hardy began
 ab yahaan se ramanujan ke jivan main ek nae yug kaa sutarapaat hua jisamen professor hardi kii bahut badi bhoomika thi
 In other words, the way a jeweler identifies a diamond and shines it, Professor Hardy has some similar place in Ramanujan's life
 professor hardi aaajeevan ramanujan kii pratibha or jivan darshan ke prashansak rahe
 This friendship of Ramanujan and Professor Hardy proved beneficial for both
 ek tarah se dekha jaae to dono ne ek duusare ke liye poorak kaa kaam kiya
 Professor Hardy valued various talented people of that time on a scale of 100
 adhikansh ganitagyon ko unhone 100 main 35 ank die or kuch vishisht vyaktiyon ko 60 ank die
 But he gave Ramanujan a full 100 in 100 points
 aarambh main ramanujan ne jab apane kiye gaye shodhakarya ko professor hardi ke paas bheja to pehle unhen bhi puraa samaj main nahin aayaa
 When he consulted his friend mathematicians, he came to the conclusion that Ramanujan is a rare personality in the field of mathematics and that he should come to England to understand the work done by him and to further research in it
 atah unhone ramanujan ko cambridge aane ke liye aamantrit kiya
 For some personal reasons and lack of funds, Ramanujan declined Professor Hardy's invitation to Cambridge
 professor hardi ko isse niraashaa hui lekin unhonen kisi bhi tarah se ramanujan ko vahaan bulaane kaa nishchay kiya
 At the same time, Ramanujan got a research career at the University of Madras, which made his life a bit easier and he was also getting full time for research work
 isi bich ek lambey patravyavhaar ke baad dhire-dhire professor hardi ne ramanujan ko cambridge aane ke liye sahamat kar liya
 Ramanujan was also funded by Professor Hardy's efforts to go to Cambridge
 ramanujan ne england jane ke pehle ganit ke kareeb 3000 se bhi adhik naye sutron ko apni notebook main likhaa tha
 Ramanujan stepped on the land of London
 vahaan professor hardi ne unke liye pehle se vvavastha kii hui thi atah inhen koi vishesh pareshaani nahin hui
 Ramanujan had little trouble in England and the reason for this was his shy, calm nature and pure satvic lifestyle
 apane puure england pravaas main ve adhikanshtah apana bhojan swayan banaate the
 This journey of England brought a revolutionary change in his life
 unhone professor hardi ke saath mil kar ucchkoti ke shodhpatr prakashit kiye
 Due to his special research he was awarded BA by Cambridge University
 Also got the title of
 lekin vahaan kii jalwaayu or rahan-sahan kii style unke adhik anukool nahin thi or unka swasthya kharaab rahane laga
 The doctors called it tuberculosis
 us samay kshay rog kii koi dawa nahin hoti thi or rogi ko senetorium me rahanaa padataa tha
 Ramanujan also had to stay there for a few days
 vahaan is samay bhi yah ganit ke sutron main nai nai kalpanaaen kiya karte the
 After this, Ramanujan was named a Fellow of the Royal Society
 aise samay main jab bharat gulaami main ji rahaa tha tab ek ashwet vyakti ko royal socity kii sadsyta milanaa ek bahut badi baat thi
 In the entire history of the Royal Society, there has been no member younger than them till date
 puure bharat main unke shubhachintakon ne utsav manaaya or sabhaayen kii
 After membership of the Royal Society, he also became the first Indian to get the fellowship of Trinity College
 ab aisa lag rahaa tha ki sab kuch bahut acchhee jagah par ja rahaa he
 But Ramanujan's health was deteriorating and eventually he had to return to India on the advice of doctors
 bharat aane par inhen madras vishvavidhyalay main praadhyaapak kii naukari mil gai
 And Ramanujan was rekindled in teaching and research
 bharat lautne par bhi swasthya ne inkaa saath nahin diya or haalat gambhir hoti ja rahi thi
 In the case of this disease also, he wrote a high level research paper on mock theta function
 ramanujan dwaara pratipaadit is falan kaa upyog ganit hi nahin balki chikitsavigyaan main cancer ko samajhane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 His declining health became a matter of concern for all and even now doctors have given him the answer
 ant main ramanujan ke vidaa kii ghadi aa hi gai
 In the morning of 26 April 1920, he became unconscious and by midday he gave up his life
 is samay ramanujan kii aayu maatr 33 varsh thi
 His untimely demise was an irreparable loss to the mathematics world
 puure desh videsh main jisane bhi ramanujan kii mrityu kaa samachar suna vahiin stabdh ho gaya
 Ramanujan and most of the work done by him still remains an enigma for scientists
 ek bahut hi saamaanya parivaar main janm le kar puure vishwa ko aashcharyachakit karne kii apni is yatra main inhone bharat ko apurv gaurav pradaan kiya
 His old register on which he used to write his theorems and formulas was suddenly found in the library of Trinity College in 1976
 kareeb ek sau pannon kaa yah register aaj bhi vaigyanikon ke liye ek paheli bana hua he
 This register was later known as Ramanujan's note book
 mumbai ke tata moolbhoot anusandhan santhaan dwaara iskaa prakaashan bhi kiya gaya he
 Like Ramanujan's researches, his style of working in mathematics was also bizarre
 ve kabhi kabhi aadhi raat ko sote se jaag kar slate par ganit se sutara likhane lagate the or phir so jate the
 In this way it seemed that they were solving mathematics questions even in their dreams
 ramanujan ke naam ke saath hi unki kuladevi kaa bhi naam liya jaataa he
 He always kept in mind zero and infinite and used the mathematical formulas to explain its interrelationships
 ramanujan ke kaary karne kii ek visheshta thi
 Earlier, he used to write a new formula or theorem of mathematics but did not pay much attention to its origin
 iske bare main puche jane par ve kehete the ki yah sutara unhen namgiri devi kii krupa se praapt hue hai
 Ramanujan's faith in spirituality was so deep that he considered any work done in the field of mathematics as a part of spirituality
 ve dharm or aadhyatm main keval vishwaas hi nahin rakhte the balki use taarkik rup se prastut bhi karte the
 He used to say that "for me that mathematics formula does not mean that i do not get spiritual thoughts
" ” Ramanujan worked mainly in the field of number theory in England for five years
 ramanujan ne nimnlikhit sutara pratipaadit kiya- The specialty of this formula is that it expresses the relation of the two most famous constants of mathematics through an infinite continuous fraction
 pai ke liye unhone ek doosraa sutara bhi diya tha- 'ramanujan number' is a natural number that can be represented in two different ways by the sum of cubes of two numbers
 udhaaharan - 9 3 + 10 3 = 1 3 + 12 3 = 1729 { \ displaystyle 9^{3}+10^{3}=1^{3}+12^{3}=1729} 
 Similarly, atah 1729, 4104, 20683, 39312, 40033 aadi ramanujan sankhyaayein hai

 aspasht tark ek prakaar kaa bahu-maan tark he jisamen charon ke satyaman 0 or 1 ke bich main kuch bhi ho sakate hai 
 Its use is consistent with the concept of 'partial truth' because often we find in life that an argument is neither completely 'true' nor completely 'untrue'
 iske vipareet booleey tark main charon ke maan yaa to 0 hote hai yaa 1
 Digital circuits operate only on boolean logic
 'faji logic' shabdasmooh kaa upyog sabase pehle 1965 main lotphi jaadeh ne aspasht samucchy-siddhanth ke pratipaadan ke saath kiya tha
 But the study of ambiguous logic was going on since the 1920s, which was called infinite-value logic
 aspasht tark kaa upyog bahut se kshetron main kushaltapurvak kiya jaataa he jisamen kuch pramukh kshetra hai- niyantran siddhanth, kritrim buddhi aadi
 Both the degrees of truth and probabilities range between 0 and 1 and so they may initially look similar
 haalanki, vaicharik rup se ve alag hote hai; truth, aspasht rup se paribhaashit set main membership kaa pratinidhitiv karata he jo probability theori kii tarah kisi event yaa condishan ke liklihud nahin hota he
 For example, take a glass of 100 ml containing 30 ml of water
 tab ham do avadharanaon par vichaar kar sakate hai: empti or phul 
 The meaning of each of these can be represented by a fixed fuzzy set
 uske baad hi koi is gilaas ko 0
7 khaali or 0
3 bhare hue gilaas ke rup main paribhaashit kar saktaa he
 Note that the concept of emptiness will be subjective and will thus depend on the observer or designer
 doosraa diziner bhi baraabar-baraabar acchhee tarah se ek set membership kaary kaa dizin karegaa jahaan gilaas ko 50 ml se kam ke sabhi vailus ke liye bharaa hua mana jayega
 yah samajhnaa bahut jaruri he ki fazi logic, truth digriyon ko veganes phenomenon ke ek ganitiya model ke rup main prayog karata he jabaki probability, randmaness kaa ek ganitiya model he
 a probabilistic setting would first define a scalar variable for the glass to be full and then define conditional distributions describing the probability that someone would call the glass full, indicating a specific level of completeness
 However, this model has no meaning without acknowledging the occurrence of some event, for example, after a few minutes, the glass will be half empty
 Note that conditioning can be achieved by placing a specific observer that randomly selects a distribution of levels and deterministic observers, or both, for the glass
 parinamswaroop, probability main saadharantah fazines ke sivaa kuch nahin he, ye to maatr alag-alag avadharanaen hai jo baahar se ek jaisi lagati hai kyonki inamen vaastavik sankhyaon ke ek jaise interval kaa prayog hota he
 De Morgan's theorem has dual applicability and properties of irregular variables
 phir bhi, chunki aise prameya binary logic stats ke gunon ke anuroop hote hai, isliye vyakti yah dekh saktaa he ki kahaan par bhram paidaa ho saktaa he
 a basic application can reflect sub-ranges of a continuous variable
 udhaaharan ke liye, anti-lock brake ke taapmaana ke maapan main vishesh taapmaana kii shreniyon ko paribhaashit karne vaale kai alag membership vaale functions kaa samavesh ho saktaa he jo brakes ko acchhee tarah se niyantrit karne ke liye aavashyak hote hai
 Each function represents the same temperature value of a truth value that ranges from 0 to 1
 in truth vailus ko tab brakes ko niyantrit karne ke tareeqon ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye prayog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 In this image, the meanings of cold, warm, and hot expressions are depicted through functions mapping of a temperature scale
 us scale par ke ek bindu main teen "truth vailus" hai — teen functions main se prayek ke liye ek-ek vailu
 image kii khadi rekha ek vishesh taapmaana ko teen tir gez ke madhyam se darshaati he
 Since the red arrow indicates zero, this temperature can be considered "not hot"
 naarangi rang kaa tir ise "slitli warm" or nila tir ise "feireli cold" ke rup main varnit kar saktaa he
 While variables in mathematics commonly assume numerical values, in applications of fuzzy logic, non-numeric linguistic variables are often used to facilitate the expression of rules and facts
 ek bhashaai veriable jaise ki age, main yang yaa yuva athwa iske vipareet old yaa vruddh jaisaa ek vailu shaamil ho saktaa he
 However, the greatest applicability of linguistic variables is that it can be modified through linguistic hedges applied to elementary terms
 bhashaai hejej kuch kaaryon ke saath sambhddha ho sakate hai
 For example, LA Zadeh suggested taking the membership work class
 haalanki, yah model acchhee tarah se kaam nahin karata he
 See the reference for more information
 fazi set theori, fazi sets par fazi prachaalkon ko paribhaashit karata he
 The only problem with its application is that the appropriate fuzzy operator may not be known
 isi karanvash, fazi logic aam taur par IF-THEN niyamon kaa prayog karata he yaa uski sanrachana karata he, jaise - fazi assocative metrices
 The rules are generally expressed as follows: IF variable IS property THEN action udhaaharan ke liye, ek saadhaaran taapmaana niamak jo ek pankhe kaa prayog karata he, use is prakaar dekh sakate hai: If the temperature is too cold then stop the fan
 If the temperature is cold then slow down the fan
 If the temperature is normal then maintain this level
 If the temperature is hot then increase the fan speed isamen koi "ELSE" nahin he - sabhi niyamon kaa moolyankan kiya jaataa he kyonki taapmaana ek hi samay par alag-alag digriyon main "cold" or "normal" ho sakate hai
 The AND, OR and NOT operators of Boolean logic are present in fuzzy logic, which are usually defined as minimum, maximum, and complement; They are called zadeh operators when they are defined in this way
 isliye fazi veriables x or y ke liye: NOT x =) x AND y = minimum, truth) x OR y = maximum, truth) anya prachaalak bhi hai jo swabhaavatah bhashaai hote hai unhen hejez kehete hai or unka bhi anuprayog kiya ja saktaa he
 These are usually adverbs, such as "vari" or "sum", which modify the meaning of a set using a mathematical formula
 anuprayog main, programing language prolog ko iske facilitis ke saath fazi logic ko karyanvit karne ke liye acchhee tarah se gear kiya jaataa he taaki "niyamon" ke ek database ko sthapit kiya ja sake jo logic ko ghataane ke liye puche jate hai
 Such programming is known as logic programming
 jab ek baar fazi relations ko paribhaashit kar diya jaataa he, tab fazi relational database ko viksit karnaa sambhav ho jaataa he
 The first fuzzy relational database, FRDB, was seen in Maria Zemankova's dissertation

 In mathematical logic, "fuzzy logic" has many formal systems; Most of them belong to the so-called t-norm Fuzzy Logics
 sabase mahatvapurn proposishnal fazi logics hai: They extend this by adding universal and existential quantifiers to the above-mentioned fuzzy logic in the same way that propositional logic is constructed from propositional logic
 tii-norm fazi logics main universal quantifier ke cimentics, quantiphoid up-sutara ke udaahranon ke truth digriyon ke infimum hote hai
 These logics, also known as fuzzy type theory, extend predicate fuzzy logics to be able to quantify predicates and higher-order objects as well

 Any axiomitable fuzzy theory is recursively enumerable
 vishesh rup se, logic ke aadhaar par tru formulon kaa fazi set, is tathy ke baavjood ricorsiwali inumrable hota he ki valid formulon kaa crisp set aam taur par ricorsiwali inumrable nahin hota he
 In addition, any axiomatizable and complete theory is decidable
 fazi logic ke carch thisis ko samarthan dene ke liye yah ek mukt prashn he jo yah daawa karata he ki fazi sabsets ke ricorsive inumrability kii prastaavit dharna, ek paryaapt dharna he
 For this purpose, further investigation on the notion of fuzzy grammar and the fuzzy Turing machine should be necessary

 Offset press was developed in two stages - jaraavidya or jararogvidya kaa sambandh pranimaatr ke, visheshkar manushya ke vruddh hone tathaa vriddhavastha kii samasyaon ke adhyayan se he
 Every substance of the world, inanimate and living, are all old, they are living
 prayek dhaatu, pashaan, kashtha, yahan tak ki kitni hi dhaatuon kii radiodharmita kaa gun bhi mand ho jaataa he
 This is called aging or aging
 ek prakaar se utpatti ke saath hi jirnan prarambh ho jaataa he, to bhi yauvan kaal kii charam seemaa par pahunchne ke pashchaat hi jirnan athwa jaravastha kii pratyaksh pranrabh hota he
 There are three parts of Gerontology: is avasthaa main jo rog hote hai, unke vishay ko jararogvidya kaha jaataa he
 The treatment of diseases of old age is also part of this
 jaravastha ke prarambh ke saamaanya lakshan, baalo kaa safed hona tathaa twachaa par jhurriyaan pad janaa mahatv kii ghatana nahin he
 Its specialties are those changes in the tissues or tissues, due to which the activity of those organs slows down
 is prakaar ke parivartan bahut dhimen or dirghakaal main hote hai
 The first symptom of this state is the loss of power to walk, run, run
 kintu yadi vyakti yuvavastha main swasth rahaa he to abhyantrangon main hraas dirghakaal tak nahin hota tathaa vichaar kii shakti bad jaati he
 Older person has special ability to understand and solve worldly questions due to experiences of his age
 isiilie kaha gaya he ki "na sa sabha yatra na santi vriddha:"
 The old person's power to understand new subjects also does not decrease
 yahi paaya gaya he ki 82 varsh kii aayu main vyakti kii vishay ko grahan karne kii shakti 12 varsh ke balak ke samaan hoti he
 This power is most advanced at the age of 22
 pranimaatr kaa sharir asankhya koshikaon ke samoohon kaa bana hua he
 Hence the action of degradation means the degradation of cells
 koshikaon kii sadaa utpatti hoti rahati he
 They continue to perish and new cells are also produced
 yah avadhi janm se lekar mrityu paryant hoti rahati he
 In this way cells always remain new
 koshikaon kaa samuhik karm hi ang kaa karm he
 But when the old age starts, the power of their origin starts decreasing and the lower the origin, the more the work force of the limbs decreases
 koshika ke jirnan pravidhi kaa gyaan abhi tak atyalp he
 Knowledge of this means knowledge of life
 iskaa gyaan ho jane par jivan hi badla ja saktaa he
 Decreased limb decreases the ability of the body to respond to external stimuli
 atev yah rogon ke jeevanuon aadi ke sharir main pravesh karne par unka pratirodh nahin kar paata
 It is unable to make new tissue when it is damaged due to shock etc
 yadhyapi jaravastha ke rog yuvavastha ke rogon se kisi prakaar bhinn nahin hote, to bhi uparyukt kaarnon se chikitsa main baadha utpann ho jaati he or chikitsak ko vishesh aayojan karnaa hota he
 Typical diseases that occur in old age are: arterial sclerosis, acute blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, cancer and cataract
 inamen se pratham or dwitiya rogon kaa hriday or shaareerik rakt sancharan se sidhaa sambandh hone ke kaaran unase anek prakaar se haani pahunchne kii ashanka rahati he
 The characteristic of the diseases of the above mentioned age is that they begin long before the symptoms appear, even when they cannot be suspected
 2 se 20 varsh purv unka prarambh hota he
 Many times, after examining the patient due to other disorders, their doctor finds out, then it becomes impossible to stop them and they become incurable; Therefore, the doctor should keep in mind the future potential while examining the patients of old age
 sharir ke bheetar hi utpann vikaar in rogon kaa kaaran hote hai
 Like bacteria, they have no external cause, so their control is impossible
 prayogon se maaloom hua ki sharir kii koshikaaye bahudirghajivi hoti hai
 a scholar cut a piece of hen's fetal heart and put it in the appropriate nutrient material for 34 years
 is deergh kaal ke pashchaat bhi ve koshikaaye waisi hi sajiv or kriyasheel thim jaisi prarambh main
 Cells have been kept alive for many long times
 vidwaanon kaa kathan he ki ve amar si maaloom hoti he
 Therefore, the question arises that what is the reason of old age? vidwaanon kaa mat he ki jaraa kaa kaaran koshikaon ke bich kii antarvastu drav, tantuon aadi main dekhnaa chahie
 According to them, these fibers or other types of material fluid grow, which become hard due to the accumulation of mineral salts in them
 is kaaran atanrsthaan main hokar jo vahikaaye koshikaon ko poshan pahunchaati hai, ve dab jaati hai tathaa dab kar nasht ho jaati hai jisase koshikaon main poshan nahin pahunch paata or ve nasht hone lagati hai
 This is the origin of old age
 jaravastha sadaa se saamaajik prashn rahi he
 In old age, the person himself does not have the power to earn a living and in old age it is difficult for him to walk or do routine work
 atev vridhon ko na keval apni udar purti ke liye apitu apane astitv tak ke liye dusron par nirbhar karnaa padataa he
 There has always been a question in front of the society, how the elders should not be allowed to bear the burden on the society, to make them a useful part of the society and to take care of them, fulfill their needs and provide all kinds of facilities
 yah prashn 20veen shatabdi main or bhi jatil ho uthaa he, kyonki jeevankaal kii avadhi main vishesh vruddhi hone se vridhon kii sankhya bahut bad gai he
 For this reason, they have residency, old age pension government, their maintenance, suitable work for those who are able to work, medical arrangements when sick and many other questions that the society will have to solve
 is vishay kii ore san 1940 se purv vishesh dhyaan nahin diya gaya tha
 But now this question has become so complicated, especially in Western countries, that the governments of those countries are busy to think seriously on this question and make appropriate plans, as it has an impact on all the age groups of the caste

 The site was a giant insect in the arthropods, spreading the wings of the vyadhipatang 2 in those days
 
 It was from the foot that it appeared that the atmosphere of that era was more dense, but the shape of the wings could also be due to the lack of rivalry in the air, because birds did not appear at that time

 His interest in writing was already awakened before he joined the army

 Despite the wealth and literary talent, Tolastoy yearned for peace of mind

 Leaving his family, he set out to serve God and the poor
 unke swasthya ne adhik dinon tak unka saath nahin diya
 Finally, on 20 November 1910, at a small railway station named Astapava, this rich son embraced death as a poor, destitute, sick old man

 par tollstoy kaa ant:karan ise uchit nahin samajhataa tha
 He has clearly condemned it in his diary
 1844 main tollstoy kazan vishvavidhyalay main pravisht hue or 1847 tak unhonen paurvatya bhashaaon or vidhisanhitaon kaa adhyayan kiya
 Due to the question of division of the state, he had to leave the university without graduating

 But this rumor remained a rumor and eventually the peasants were forced to repent

 In 1851, Tolstoy also entered the army for some time
 unki niyukti kokeshas main parvatiy kabeelon se honevaali dirghakaalin ladaai main hui jahaan avkaash kaa samay ve likhane padhane main lagaate rahe
 It was here that his first work, Childhood, was produced in 1852, which was published in a letter titled "tie Contemporari" under the name of LT
 us romentic yug main bhi is neeras yathartwaadee dhang kii rachana ne logon ko aakrisht kiya or uske rachanaakaar ke naam ke sambandh main tatkaaleen saahitiyik tarah tarah ke atkal lagane lage the
 In 1854, Tolstoy was sent to the front of the Danube; From there, he shifted to Sebastopol, which was the strongest front of the Crimean War
 yahan unhen yuddh or yuddh ke sanchaalkon ko nikat se dekhne parakhane kaa paryaapt avasar mila
 On this front, he stayed till the end and was directly contested in many bitter encounters

 They got ample opportunity to understand the usefulness of war and its effects on life, and here they got proper use of these achievements in their many later works

 In 1857 and 1860–61, he toured various countries of Western Europe
 parvarti paryaton kaa mukhya uddeshy atddeshiy shikshapaddatiyon or daatavya sansthaaon ke sanghatan or kriyakalapon hi jaankaree praapt karnaa tha
 In this journey, he witnessed the death of his elder brother suffering from tuberculosis
 ghortam yaatnaaon ke ananthar honevaali yakshmakrant bhai kii mrityu kaa tollstoy par marmaatak prabhaav padaa
 The above-mentioned incidents have been the basis of the most poignant depictions of the death in war and peace, the death of Anna Carnina and Ivan Ilyich
 yatra se lautakar unhone apane gaanv yasnaya polyana main krishakon ke bacchon ke liye ek skool kholaa
 The education system of this school was very progressive
 isamen vartmaan parikshapranali evam iske aadhaar par uteern anuteern kaarne kii vyavastha nahin rakhi gai thi
 The school was a big success mainly due to Tolstoy's leadership power and heartfelt passion towards him
 vidhyalay kii ore se, gaanv ke hi naam par ""yasnaya polyana"" naamak ek patrika bhi nikalati thi jisamen prakashit tollstoy ke lekhon main vidhyalay ore uske chaatro kii vibhinn samasyaon par bade hi sargarbhit vichaar vyakt hue hai
 In 1862, Tolstoy was married to a high-ranking elite woman named Safia Berhus
 unke vaivaahik jivan kaa purvaash to bada sukhad rahaa par uttaransh katutapurna beetaa
 In Tolstoy's married life, the ideal of a housewife was completely similar to that of an Indian housewife: but the views of the then Russian elite society were quite different
 1863 se 1869 tak tollstoy kaa samay "waar and pis" kii rachana main evam 1873 se 76 tak kaa samay "anna karenina" kii rachana main beetaa
 Both these compositions greatly elevated Tolstoy's literary fame
 ve manushyajivan kaa rahasy or uske tatvachintan ke prati vishesh jaagruk the
 The period from 1875 to 1879 was very disappointing for him - he had lost his faith in God and had taken off on committing suicide
 par ant main unhone isapar vijay pai
 In 1878–79, he composed his controversial work called "confession"
 iske krantikari vichaar aise hai jinke kaaran rus main iske prakaashan kii anumati bhi nahin mili or pustak switsraland main prakashit hui
 Many of his other compositions of this time are of this category and they are all printed in Switzerland
 1878 se lekar 1885 tak kii avadhi main falaatmak sahitya srijan kii drushti se tollstoy niskriy rahe
 His intuition remained entangled in the search for the secret of human life
 ambtak kii samast rachanaayen unhen vyarth prathit hone lageen
 But in 1886, he again appeared as a high-profile well-known writer and in the same year published his great novel work "the Death of Ivan Ilyich"
 unke aachaar sambandhi vishwaason ke prati ab sara sansar aakrishth ho chukaa tha or yasnaya polyana gram kii manyata utkrisht tirthasthali ke rup main jagaddhikhyath ho chuki thi
 Our Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi was a young man at this time
 inhen dinon unhone tollstoy kii rachanaayen ruchipurvak padhi thim or unki ore aakrisht hue the
 Towards the end of the 19th century, Tolstoy's service to the poor and helpless grew to such an extent that he donated all his income from his creations to Russia
 apni patni ko maatr utana ansh lene kii unhone anumati di jitna parivaar ke bhar poshan ke liye anivaary tha
 He gave all the proceeds of his novel called 'resurgence' to the Russian pacifist caste Dukhbor people to abandon Russia and settle in Canada
 1910 main sahasaa unhone apane paitrik gram "yasnaya polyana" ko sarvada ke liye parityakt karne kaa nishchay kiya
 He departed with his daughter Alexandra on 10 November 1910, but on 22 November 1910, he accidentally died in a lung in the passage station Estapovo
 unki dharmabhavana badi udaar or vyapak thi
 He had a clear antagonism towards the then Christianity
 apane vichaaron se ve ek prakaar ke sarvadevvaadi prathit hote hai
 He considered death as the inevitable end of the body
 manushya ko ve sharir kii antim or avashyambhavi parinti maanate the
 He considered it appropriate to assess everything that came in contact with human beings from the criteria of utility and for this reason he always remained curious about the purpose of life
 niruddeshy, vichaarheen ore aatmakendrit jivan ko ve ek prakaar kaa paap maanate the; yahan tak ki sambhog ko ve keval santanotpatti ke uddeshy se hi vihit maanate the
 In psychological works, Fyodor Dostoyevsky equates Tolstoy
 galswardi, tamas maan, juls romyna aadi mahaan lekhakon par tollstoy kaa ullekhneey prabhaav padaa he
 Later Russian writers have also been strongly influenced by Tolstoy
 lenin sahit vishwa ke anekanek vidwaanon ne tolastoy ke sahitya, visheshtah 'yuddh or shaanti' kii sarvshereshthata muktakanth se sweekaar kii he; parantu tolastoy ek vichaarak bhi the or saahitiyik rachanaaon ke saath-saath nibandhon tathaa anya vidhaon main bhi unhone apane vichaaron kii abhivyakti kii he
 Regarding the usefulness of his age-old reference ideas, Lenin believes that "tolstoy has created such fine literature that will always be valuable and readable to the public, when he overturns the zamindars and the capitalists and arranges a social life for himself Will do it
 saath hi tolastoy ullekhneey oj ke saath vartmaan vyavastha main paddalit aam janata kii manodasha ko vyakt karne tathaa uski dasha kaa varnan karne tathaa uske virodh evam rosh ke swatahsfoort bhaavon ko mukherit karne main samarth hue hai
 Tolstoy mainly belonged to the era from 1861 to 1904 and has - as an artist, thinker and preacher - highlighted in his works the historical peculiarities of the First Russian Revolution, its capabilities and flaws with surprising clarity
 " Despite this, in the context of the various flaws of the ancient system, the internal vacuity of the rich class and the views of Tolstoy appearing against him, Lenin states that "there was nothing new in Tolstoy's criticism
" unhone koi aisi baat nahin kahi jo unase bahut arase pehle europea tathaa roosi sahitya main mehanatakashon ke himytiyon dwaara na kahi gayi ho
 The characteristic and historical significance of Tolstoy's criticism is that the radical change in the attitude of the mass people of Russia - the pastoral, peasants of our period - is expressed in such a way, Which was just the work of a talented artist
 " Lenin understood Tolstoy's literary significance very well and therefore he has praised him heavily; But at the same time he also understood the imperative of being aware of many harmful aspects of his ideas in the era
 isliye disambar 1910 main unhone spashtatya yah vichaar vyakt kiya tha ki tolastoy kii saahitiyik rachanaaon kaa adhyayan karke roosi majdoor varg apane dushmano ko zyada acchhee tarah pahchaan sakegaa
 By studying his principles, the entire Russian public will know what his personal weakness, which prevented him from fulfilling his goal of independence, was contained
 aage badhane ke liye yah jaananaa jaruri he
 All those who are obstructing this progress, declare Tolastoy as 'the conscience of all of us', 'life-teacher'
 yah vah jhooth he jise udaarataavaadi jo tolastoy ke siddhanton ke kranti-virdohi pahalu kaa istemaal karnaa chaahate hai, jaanboojhkar failaa rahe hai
 Tolstoy's lie of being a 'life-teacher' is seen by some former social-democrats who are seen by liberals
 roosi janata aazaadee tabhi praapt karegi, jab vah samaj legi ki use behatar jivan ke liye sangharsh karne kii shiksha tolastoy se nahin, balki us varg se leni he, jiskaa mahatv tolastoy nahin samaj paye or jo us puraani duniya ko, jisase tolastoy ghrinaa karte the, ukhaad phenkane main samarth ekmaatr varg he -- arthath sarvhaara varg se
 Lenin again elaborated on 22 January 1911, citing some of Tolstoy's narrative works, as well as several non-fiction works, expressing the view that despite being a reactionary and utopian element in Tolstoyism, some circles of the public 25 years ago For perhaps, critical elements of Tolstoy's theories could have had practical utility
 par ab, udhaahrantah pichley dashak main, aisi baat nahin ho sakati thi, kyonki pichhali shatabdi ke nauven dashak se lekar shatabdi ke ant tak aitihaasik vikaas bahut aage bad gaya he
 So today, when the above events have put an end to the 'eastern' stagnation, today, when the consciously reactionary, narrow-class and selfish-class meanings of 'vakhi' cults spread so widely among the liberal bourgeoisie Gone, today, when some of the Marxists, who are showing the contagion of these ideas, have also felt that the result is the 'immersionist' tendency, then respect the principles of Tolastoy To justify or smuggle their 'disrespect', their 'soul' woes, their call for 'self-realization', the principle of 'conscience' and world 'love', their teachings of austerity and Quietism, etc
 Every effort to do it is the direct and deepest loss
 Leo Tolstoy dedicated websites Biographies and critiques Leo Tolstoy in the media The Government of India has consistently taken a tough stance on the issue of forced labor or bonded labor in the country
 yah is krurta se prabhavit nagarikon ke moulik maanavadhikaron kaa hanan maanata he or yah iske yatha sabhavan nunatam samay main purna samaapan ko lekar adig he
 The Bonded Wages System was abolished from the entire country on 25 October 1975 by implementing the Bonded Wages System Act 1976
 is adhinium ke jariye bandhua majdoor gulaami se mukt hue saath hi unke karj kii bhi samaapti hui
 This made the practice of slavery a cognizable punishable offense by law
 is adhinium ko sambandhit rajya sarkaron dwaara kriyanvit kiya ja rahaa he
 The Bonded Labor Practices Act, 1976 was enacted to eradicate the practice of bonded labor so as to prevent the economic and actual exploitation of the weaker sections of the population and to take action in respect of related and ancillary matters
 isane sabhi bandhua mazaduron ko ekapaksheeya rup se bandhan se mukt kar diya or saath hi unke karjo ko bhi parismpt kar diya
 It considered bonded practice to be a cognizable offense punishable by law
 yah kanoon shram mantralay or sambandhit rajya sarkaron dwaara prashasit or karyanvit kiya ja rahaa he
 To supplement the efforts of the State Governments, a centrally sponsored scheme scheme for rehabilitation of bonded laborers was launched by the Ministry
 is yojana ke antargat, rajya sarkaron ko bandhua mazaduron ke punarvaas ke liye samatuly anudaanon ke aadhaar par kendriya sahaayta muhaiyaa karai jaati he
 The main provisions of the Act are as follows: - kisi bhi kshetra main bacchon dwaara apane bachapan main di gai seva ko bal mazdooree kehete he
 This is done automatically by children, either due to irresponsible parents, or because of the lack of necessary resources to live a life due to the pressure exerted by the owners to increase their profits on low-cost investment
 , The reason for this does not matter because all the factors force children to live their lives without childhood
 bachapan sabhi ke jivan main vishesh or sabase khushi kaa pal hota he jisamen bachche prakruti, priyajanon or apane mata-pita se jivan jeene kaa tarika sikhte he
 From all social, intellectual, physical, and mental perspectives, child labor acts as a barrier to the growth and development of children
 bal shram pratishedh va viniman adhinium 1986 par najar daalen to iske antargat 18 vyavsaayon or 65 prakriyaaon main bacchon se kaam karwaanaa purnatah pratibandhit he
 Tea shops, dhabas, hotels, roadside foodstuffs and work done in homes are also included in these dangerous occupations
 gharelu naukar kaa kaam is suchi main 10 oktober 2006 se laayaa gaya he
 In the areas which are not covered under this Act, there are certain standards for getting work done by children below 14 years of age
 jaise teen ghante kaam ke baad ek ghanta aaraam, or shaam 7 baje se subah 8 baje ke bich koi kaam na liya janaa
 It is absolutely forbidden for children to work overtime

 Several cases of domestic maids being beaten, not given food, locked up and physically abused dominated the media in the past

 When this information was sought from the Rajasthan government, the labor department said that in the last five years, only 10 children were rescued from the whole state

 Not a single one in Kolkata

 On the one hand there is child labor due to poverty, on the other hand poverty also increases due to child labor
 saste majdoor hone ke kaaran bacchon se kaam karavaaya jaataa he
 If the adult laborer is given a minimum wage fixed by the government in place of the child laborer, then the parents may start sending the child to school
 bal mazdooron ko kaam se hataane ke saath hi unke punarvaas par bhi dhyaan dena jaruri he
 According to the Ministry of Labor, special child labor schools run under the National Child Labor Project are for such children only
 pichley teen saalon main desh ke 260 jilon main chal rahe in vidyalayon main lagbhag teen lakh bal mazdooron ko daakhila diya gaya he
 But research reports of ngos have revealed that most of the children enrolled in these schools have never been child laborers and they were already enrolled in the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan schools
 bal shramikon ke punarvaas ke liye padhai ke saath-saath unke pariwaron ke aarthik protsaahan par bhi kaam karnaa hoga
 The penalty recovered from the owner should be spent on the economic rehabilitation of the child and his family, but this is not happening
 bal shram pratishedh va viniman adhinium 1986 main parivartan kaa yah ekadam upyukt samay he
 a child up to 14 years of age should be banned in any way, as education is now his legal right
 saath hi yah bhi sunishchit karnaa chahie ki yadi kahin bacchon se kaam karavaaya ja rahaa ho to karrwai maalik ke saath-saath us kshetra ke shram adhikari par bhi ho

 Muscle memory: When a task is done continuously several times with the help of muscle, that muscle remembers that task and we are able to do that work quickly
 yadi koi bhi kaary ham lambey samay tak karte hai, to us kaary ko karne ke liye hamen adhik sochane kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati kyonki yah kaary hamaari mansapeshi kar leti he
 This action protects the mind from thinking more and doing more work
 iskaa mukhya rup se udhaaharan saaikal chalaanaa, kunjee patal kaa upyog karnaa aadi hai
 Even if someone loses his memory due to brain injury etc
, then he cannot forget to do these types of tasks
 parantu iske liye koi bhi kaary ko lambe samay tak karnaa hota he, jab tak kii aapkaa sharir us kaary ko karne hetu apni aadat main shaamil na kar le
 While learning to drive any type of vehicle, the mind sometimes does not remember how to stop the car and how to change the direction
 parantu dhire dhire jab us par adhik abhyaas karte hai to vah smriti ke jaise hi hamaare mansapeshi dwaara niyantrit hone lagata he
 This was discovered after a research in around 1900 century
 iske pashchaat varsh 1987 main bhi ek anusandhan kiya gaya jisase isaki pushti hui
 Apart from this, it has also been found in some research that only muscle memory is used while writing
 pehle ise vaahan smriti kehete the parantu ab ise mansapeshiy smriti kehete hai
 In the 1900 century, people had great attraction towards it
 jiske kaaran kai anusandhan kiye gaye, jinase yah pataa laga kii yah smriti keval kuch samay ke abhyaas se yaad nahin hoti balki yah varshon ke abhyaas se hi swatah yaad ho jaati he
 Along with this, it also came to know that it does not only do any special task like driving, but all the work that we do throughout our life is memorized in our muscle as memory
 jisase ham adhik gati se us kaary ko kar saken
 When learning to drive any vehicle, we learn it with slow speed and with many obstacles
 yah kaary sikhte samay kathin hota he or jab ham abhyaas kar lete hai to yah kaary saral ho jaataa he
 It is mainly of two types
 pehali jo kuch samay ke liye hoti he or duusari jo adhik samay tak hoti he
 Encoding muscle memory is also called muscle memory
 shakti ko kis prakaar se upyog karnaa he iskaa prashikshan lenaa arthath use sahi dhang se upyog karnaa he
 If we are uncomfortable in doing any task then we still do that work then we can understand how to use the power on it
 iske alaava hamaara sharir bhi us kaary ko karne ke anukool banataa jaataa hai
 Our body is not capable of doing every task nor can we do the work like other people
 kyonki koi bhi kaary jo koi doosraa vyakti kar rahaa he, vah uske kai varshon ke prayaas ke pashchaat hua he
 For example, when we lift any weight, we cannot lift it if it is too heavy but no one else can lift it easily because it has become fit to lift the heavy weight of its muscle
 vahiin yadi aap koi aisa kaary karte hai jo anya koi vyakti nahin kar paa rahaa he to uskaa arth he ki aapke mansapeshi main us kaary ko karne ke liye anukool ban chukaa he

 In addition, the titanium isotope ratio of the Moon appears to be closer to that of the Earth, if at least any colliding body mass may be part of the Moon

 gautam buddha ek shraman the jinaki shikshaaon par buddha dharm kaa prachlan hua
 He was born in Lumbini in 563 BC in the house of King Shuddhodhana of Ikshvaku dynasty Kshatriya Shakya clan
 unki maan kaa naam mahamaya tha jo coliy vansh se thi jinka inke janm ke saat din baad nidhan hua, unka paalan maharani kii choti sagi bahan mahaprajapati gautami ne kiya
 After marriage, Siddhartha left the only firstborn child, Rahul and wife Yashodhara, leaving the royal palace in the night in search of true divine knowledge and searching for a way to liberate the world from death, death and sorrows
 varshon kii kathor sadhana ke pashchaat bodh gaya main bodhi vriksh ke neeche unhen gyaan kii prapti hui or ve siddharth gautam se buddha ban gaye
 Part of the category of unka janm 563 isvi purv ke bich shakya ganraajya kii tatkaaleen rajdhani kapilwastu ke nikat lumbini main hua tha, jo nepal main he
 The Lumbini Forest was located 8 miles west of Nautanwa station between Kapilvastu and Devdah in the Terai region of Nepal, near a place called Rukminidei
 kapilwastu kii maharani mahamaya devi ke apane naihar devdah jate hue raste main prasav pidaa hui or vahiin unhone ek balak ko janm diya
 The baby was named Siddhartha
 gautam gotra main janm lene ke kaaran ve gautam bhi kehalaae
 Kshatriya king Shuddhodana was his father
 paramparaagat katha ke anusaar siddharth kii mata kaa unke janm ke saat din baad nidhan ho gaya tha
 He was raised by his maternal aunt and Mahaprajavati, the second queen of Shuddodhan
 shishu kaa naam siddharth diya gaya, jiskaa arth he "vah jo siddhi prapti ke liye janma ho"
 During the birth ceremony, the sage Drishta Asit announced from his mountain abode - the child would either become a great king or a great pious guide
 shuddodhan ne paanchaven din ek namakaran samaaroh yojit kiya or aath brahman vidwaanon ko bhavishya padhane ke liye aamantrit kiya
 Everyone made the same dual prediction that the child would become either a great king or a great holy man
 dakshin madhya nepal main sthit lumbini main us sthal par maharaj ashok ne teesri shatabdi isa purv buddha ke janm kii smriti main ek stambh banwaaya tha
 Buddha's birthday is widely celebrated in the Theravada countries
 suddharth kaa man vachapan se hi karunaa or dayaa kaa strot tha
 It is revealed by many events in his early life
 ghuddaud main jab ghode daudte or unke munh se jhaag nikalne lagata to siddharth unhen thakaa jaanakar vahiin roak detaa or jiti hui baaji haar jaataa
 Even in the game, Siddharth liked to lose himself because defeating someone and grieving someone was not seen by him
 siddharth ne chachere bhai devdatt dwaara tir se ghayal kiye gaye hans kii sahaayta kii or uske praanon kii raksha kii
 Siddhartha not only studied the Vedas and Upanishads with Guru Vishwamitra, he also studied politics and warfare
 kushti, ghuddaud, tir-kaman, rath haankane main koi uski barabari nahin kar paata
 At the age of sixteen, Siddharth was married to Koli girl Yashodhara
 pita dwaara rituon ke anuroop banaae gaye vaibhavshaalee or samast bhogon se yukt mahal main ve yashodhara ke saath rahane lage jahaan unke putr rahul kaa janm hua
 But after marriage, his mind went into disinterest and he abandoned the family for the sake of peace and happiness
 raja shuddhodhan ne siddharth ke liye bhoga-vilaas kaa bharpoor prabandh kar diya
 Built three beautiful palaces worth three seasons
 vahaan par naach-gaan or manoranjan kii sari saamagree juta di gai
 Slaves and maids were put in his service
 par ye sab chijen siddharth ko sansar main baandhakar nahin rakh sakin
 One day in the spring, Siddhartha went on a garden walk
 unhen sadak par ek boodha aadmi dikhaai diya
 His teeth were broken, his hair was caught, his body was crooked
 haath main lathi pakade dhire-dhire kaanpata hua vah sadak par chal rahaa tha
 The second time when Kumar went for a garden walk, a patient came in front of his eyes
 uski saans teji se chal rahi thi
 The shoulders were loose
 baahen suukh gai thim
 The stomach was swollen
 cheharaa pilaa pad gaya tha
 He was able to walk very hard with the help of another
 teesri baar siddharth ko ek arthi mili
 Four men were taking him
 peeche-peeche bahut se log the
 Some were crying, some were beating their chest, some were scratching their hair
 in drishyon ne siddharth ko bahut vichlit kiya
 He thought 'damn it to youth, who soaks up life'
 dhikkaar he swasthya ko, jo sharir ko nasht kar detaa he
 Damn to life, which completes its chapter so soon
 kya budhapa, beemaari or maut sadaa isi tarah hoti rahegi saumy? chauthi baar kumaar bageeche kii saiyr ko niklaa, to use ek sanyasi dikhaai padaa
 Free from all the feelings and desires of the world, a happy monk attracted Siddhartha
 sundar patni yashodhara, dudhmunhe rahul or kapilwastu jaise rajya kaa moh chhodkar siddharth tapasya ke liye chal pade
 He reached the Rajgriha
 vahaan bhiksha maangi
 While walking around, Siddharth reached Alar Kalam and Uddak Ramputra
 unase yoga-sadhana sikhi
 Learned to trance
 par usase use santosh nahin hua
 He reached Uruvela and started doing penance in various ways there
 siddharth ne pehle to keval til-chaaval khaakar tapasya shuru kii, baad main koi bhi aahaar lenaa band kar diya
 The body became very thin
 chah saal biit gaye tapasya karte hue
 Sidharth's penance was not successful
 shanti hetu buddha kaa madhyam maarg : ek din kuch striyaan kisi nagar se lautati hui vahaan se nikaleen, jahaan siddharth tapasya kar rahaa the
 One of his songs hit Siddharth's ear - 'don't let Veena's strings loose
 dhilaa chhod dene se unka surila swar nahin nikalegaa
 But don't tighten the wires so much that they break
 ’ baat siddharth ko janch gai
 He agreed that yoga is proved only by regular dieting
 ati kisi baat kii acchhee nahin
 The medium path is right for any attainment and for this one has to do hard penance
 baisakhi poornima ke din siddharth vatvriksh ke neeche dhyansth the
 Sujata, a woman from a nearby village, had a son
 usne bete ke liye ek vatvriksh kii manauti maani thi
 He appeasement to the whole platter of gold reached cow milk pudding filling
 siddharth vahaan baitha dhyaan kar rahaa tha
 He felt that the tree goddess is sitting as if holding a body to take worship
 sujatha ne bade aadar se siddharth ko kheer bhent kii or kaha- ‘jaise meri manokamana puri hui, usee tarah aapaki bhi ho
 Siddhartha's meditation succeeded on meditating on the same night
 use sachcha bodh hua
 Since then Siddhartha has been called 'buddha'
 jis pipal vriksh ke neeche siddharth ko bodh mila vah bodhivruksh kahalaaya or gaya kaa sameepvarti vah sthaan bodhgaya
 Till the age of 80, he propagated his religion in Pali, the simple simple language of that time instead of Sanskrit
 unke sidhe saral dharm kii lokapriyata teji se badhane lagi
 After remaining under the Bodhi tree for four weeks and contemplating the nature of religion, Buddha went out to teach religion
 asadha kii poornima ko ve kaashi ke paas mrigadaav pahunche
 At the same place, he gave the first sermon and made the first five friends his followers and then sent him to preach
 pali siddhant ke mahaparinirvana sutt ke anusaar 80 varsh kii aayu main buddha ne ghoshnaa kii ki ve jald hi parinirvana ke liye ravaanaa honge
 The Buddha took his last meal, which he had received as an offering from a blacksmith named Kunda, causing him to become seriously ill
 buddha ne apane shishy anand ko nirdesh diya ki vah kunda ko samajhaae ki usne koi galati nahin kii he
 He said that this food is incredible
 bhagwaan buddha ne logon ko madhyam maarg kaa upadesh kiya
 He suggested an octagonal path for grief, its causes and redress
 unhone ahimsa par bahut jor diya he
 He condemned yajna and animal sacrifice
 buddha ke upadeshon kaa saar is prakaar he - The number of monks began to increase with the preaching of the Buddha
 bade-bade raja-maharaja bhi unke shishy banane lage
 Shuddhodhan and Rahul also initiated Buddhism
 bhikshuon kii sankhya bahut badhane par buddha sangh kii sthapana kii gai
 Later, at the urging of the people, Buddha also allowed women to take him into the union, though he did not consider it as good
 bhagwaan buddha ne ‘bahujan hitay’ lokkalyaan ke liye apane dharm kaa desh-videsh main prachaar karne ke liye bhikshuon ko idhar-udhar bheja
 The emperors like Ashoka also played an important role in the promotion of Buddhism abroad
 mauryaal tak aate-aate bharat se nikalakar buddha dharm china, japan, korea, mongolia, burma, thailand, hind china, srilanka aadi main fail chukaa tha
 Buddhism is the majority religion in these countries
 buddha ko vishnu kaa avatar mana jaataa he
