 iesao code: xac In computing, the kernel is a computer program that handles the input / output of software and translates them into central processing units for the computer and data processing instructions for electronic devices
 karnel aadhunik abhiklitron ke prachaalan tantron ke liye ek moolbhoot bhaag he
 The computer operating system is the main part, the kernel acts as a bridge between the actual data processing done by it at the hardware level and the application i

 the application
 Its main function is to establish communication between the software and hardware and use all the sources of the system as necessary to make the necessary process After that, the work can be done smoothly
 karnel ke dwaara anuprayog saftware dwaara kiye jane vaale kaaryon ko aavaran pradaan kiya jaataa he, 
 In different operating systems, the design and execution of work is done by different types of kernels as per requirements
 kintu monolyth karnel me aaparating system code ek hi sthaan par parkaarya karte hai jisase kam sthaan hone par bhi adhik kaaryakiya ja paata he

 Here the function of the kernel is to decide which of the many programs running at a particular time, which program should be allowed to run on the processor at that time memory prabandh main bhi karnel kii pramukhbhumika he yahan iskaa kaam he ki surakshit rup se hi memory main koi data pahunche
 For this, the virtual addressing system is often resorted to, in which the virtual addressing system provides an additional address to the kernel, many different processes are performed at the space provided
 yahan pate alag alag prograamon le liye alag- alag ho sakate hai, is prakriya menek baar me ek hi program ko chalane diya jaataa he jis se anuprayog krash hone se bachaa rahata he
 In many systems, it is used to store the current data on different surfaces, in place of the current memory on different surfaces, in other places such as hard drive, otherwise it occupies space on RAM, thus making the kernel operating system more available
 CPU is able to get more space than its available memory capacity
 At the behest of the kernel, it writes and leaves that data in the free space of the disk and, if necessary, the program starts running again

 vanaspatik janan ek prakaar kaa alangik janan he jo vanaspatiyon main hota he
 In this reproduction process new vegetation is produced without seeds or spores
 vanaspatik janan prakritik rup se bhi hota he or udyanvaigyanikon dwaara prerit bhi ho saktaa he
 In botanical reproduction, a botanical part originates a new tree and starts a new life, separated from the parent plant
 iske do prakaar, ek prakritik or doosraa kritrim, hai
 Natural botanical reproduction is of the following types: samudbhavan koshika main ek taraf yaa chaaron taraf anek pravaradh nikalakar matra koshika se alag hokar swatantra rup se pravardhan kar koshikaon kii shrunkhlaa banaate hai
 An example is yeast
 ek duusare prakaar ke samudbhavan ko jima samudbhavan kehete hai, jisamen paitruk pind ke kisi nikle bhaag se kaliyaan nikalakar usee ke saath lipati rahati hai, yaa alag ho jaati hai
 This is seen in genus moss, liververt and coral dendrophilia
 bhustari yaa ranor main jo paudhe sidhe khadey nahin ho sakate ve jameen par rengte hue badhate hai, unke upar ke bhaag par valkal patr rahete hai, jinke konon main kaliyaan rahati hai
 Thin thin roots between buds leave the ground and thus new plants are prepared
 doob ghaas iskaa udhaaharan he
 Sucker resembles landfall
 antar yah he ki sakar main jameen ke andar tanon par valkal patr hote hai or unke konon kii kaliyon se shakhaayen nikalakar hawa main chali jaati hai
 Shattered roots emerge from the floor of each branch and enter the ground
 pudinaa iskaa udhaaharan he
 The terrestrial or offset also spreads like terrestrial, but it is shorter and thicker than the terrestrial and creeps a short distance and produces a new plant at the end of the stem
 patrakand yaa balbil main akshakoniya kaliyaan hoti hai, jo adhik maatra main khaadya padaarth ekatrit ho jane se moti ho jaati hai or jameen par girane par nae paudhe ko janm detii hai
 Garlic, inflorescence, banalu or zaminkand, pineapple etc
 are examples of this
 prakand yaa risom ke upar valkal patr or neeche jhakadaa jaden hoti hai
 Sprouts come out from the buds of the angles of the letter and go into the air
 jaden pramukh risom se alag hokar vanshavistaar karti hai
 Examples are ginger, turmeric and ferns
 ghanakand yaa karm ke udhaaharan ghuiyaan or banda hai
 Below these lies a bloated stem called mandal
 iske upar valkalapatr kaa aavaran hota he
 They have buds in the angle, from which the seedlings go up on favorable weather and the roots come out from the bottom and go inside the earth
 is prakar nae paudhe utpann hote rahete hai
 The bulb is very dense, but its mandible is smaller and there are thick thick slices at the top
 andar kii pattee ke kone main kali rahati he, jo anukool mausam par nae tane ko janm detii he
 Onions are an example of this
 kand yaa tuber valkalapatron ke konon main kand lagata he
 The stem of the tuber remains bloated
 isamen khaadya sanchit rahata he
 Potato is a good example of this
 aalu par kaliyaan yaa aankhe hoti hai
 Each eye produces a plant
 jadon dwaara vanaspatik utpaadan main satawar, dalia or shakarkand kii jaden kand utpann karti hai, in kandon se phir nae paudhe utpann hote hai
 Leaves of some plants produce new plants in production by the leaves
 inhen patrakalika kehete hai
 Examples of this are Kuchi, Begonia, Parvanta, and Calancoi
 kuch fern main bhi isi reeti se janan hota he
 Some plants also breed artificially
 kuch paudhe tanon kii kataran se, kuch paudhe kalam baandhane se or kuch daab kalam se nae paudhon ko utpann karte hai
 The genetic purity of the plant can be maintained by artificial botanical reproduction, which is not fixed by the plant produced by the seed, and the reproduction is often certain
 aise janan ke liye khaadya padaarth paryaapt rahanaa chahie
 In its absence, the reproduction may be sexual or asexual

 During this period legislative elections in Jammu and Kashmir were first held in 1951 and Sheikh 'abdullah's party stood unopposed
 baharhaal, shaikh abdulla kabhi centre sarkaar kii krupa ke paatr ban jate the or kabhi ghrinaa ke or isiilie aksar hi unhen barkhaast kar diya jaataa or kabhi punah behaal kar diya jaataa

 Pakistan supplied military aid, weapons, recruitment and training to these groups
 2004 main shuruyaat karte hue pakistan ne kashmir main vidrohiyon ke liye apane samarthan kii samaapti shuru kii

 jabaki khud bharat ek dharmanirpeksh rajya he, puure bharat main hinduon kii tulana main musalmaan raajnneetik, saanskrithik or aarthik rup se haashie par hai
 Because of this, Muslims believe that they are not residents of India and they alienated the Kashmiri people

 His successor Asif Ali Zardari continued this policy and called the Kashmir rebels "terrorists"
 yah spasht nahin he ki pakistani inter services intelligence kaa netritv sarkaar kar rahi he ki nahin or usne kashmir main vidrohiyon ko apana samarthan dena samaapt kiya he ki nahin, haalanki nishchit rup se ugravadiyon ko pakistani ne apane samarthan ko pratibandhit kar diya he

 It is believed that by chanting and understanding this mantra, one attains God
 ise shri gayatri devi ke stri rup me bhi pujas jaataa he
 'gayatri' is also a verse which is one of the seven famous verses of the Rigveda
 in saat chhandon ke naam hai- gayatri, ushnik, anushtup, brihati, viraat, trishtup or jagati
 Gayatri Chanda has three stages of eight-eight letters each

 Gayatri has three terms
 atev jab chand yaa vaak ke rup main sristi ke pratik kii kalpana kii jane lagi tab is vishwa ko tripada gayatri kaa swaroop mana gaya

 yah mantra sarvapratham rugveda main uddhrut hua he
 Its sage is Vishwamitra and the deity is Savita

 This mantra has 24 letters
 unamem aath aath aksharon ke teen charan hai
 But in the Brahmin texts and in all the literature of the period, the complete form of the mantra was stabilized in this way by adding three vyahitras before these letters and before them Pranav or Onkar
 mantra ke is rup ko manu ne sapranava, savyahritika gayatri kaha he or jap main isi kaa vidhaan kiya he
 What is the Gayatri element and why this mantra has so much glory, it is necessary to address this question
 aarsh manyata ke anusaar gayatri ek ore virat vishwa or duusari ore maanav jivan, ek ore devtatv or duusari ore bhootatatva, ek ore man or duusari ore praan, ek ore gyaan or duusari ore karm ke parsparik sambandhon kii puri vyakhya kar detii he
 The deity of this mantra is Savita, Savita is the noun of Surya, there are many forms of Surya, among them Savita is the form which inspires all the devas
 jaagrath main savitarupi man hi maanav kii mahati shakti he
 Just as Savita is a god, so too is a god
 man hi praan kaa prerak he
 Gayatri mantra is favored to explain this relationship of mind and soul
 savita man praanon ke rup main sab karmon kaa adhishthata he, yah satya pratyakshsiddh he
 It is said in the third phase of Gayatri

 This is his character
 kintu man kii is karmakshmalakti ke liye man kaa shashakt yaa balishtha hona aavashyak he
 That mind which is required for the induction of sharp action is the Varanya bharga
 man kii shaktiyon kaa to parvaar nahin he
 The fraction of which a man is able to make for himself, while for him, there is a fraction of that sharp
 atev savita ke bharg kii prarthana main vishesh dhwani yah bhi he ki savita yaa man kaa jo divya ansh he vah parthiv yaa bhuton ke dharaatal par avateern hokar parthiv sharir main prakashit ho
 No other wish is found in this Gayatri Mantra
 yahan ek maatr abhilaashaa yahi he ki maanav ko ishwar kii ore se man ke rup main jo divya shakti praapt hui he uske dwaara vah usee savita kaa gyaan kare or karmon ke dwaara use is jivan main sarthak kare
 The three vyahtriyas to the east of Gayatri are also tolerant
 bhu prithvilok, rugveda, agni, parthiv jagat or jaagrath avasthaa kaa suchak he
 Bhuva: Astrology, Yajurveda, the god of air, is a sign of the vital world and self-state
 swa: dhuloak, samaveda, adityadevataa, manomay jagat or sushupti avasthaa kaa suchak he
 Many other symbols of this sacra have been said in the Brahmins, Upanishads and Puranas, but if you want to understand the Nikhil world prevailing in the expansion of the triad, then for the sake of it, this 4 brief hint is placed at the beginning of Gayatri
 
 a, u, m in teenon matraaon se kaa swaroop bana he
 a Agni, u Vayu and i symbolize Aditya
 yah vishwa prajapati kii vaak he
 There is an infinite range of speech, but if you want to take a brief sample of it and tell the form of the whole world, then saying A, U, m or 4 will give an introduction to the sacra whose trifle symbol is Tripada Gayatri

 The modern hockey emerged in the mid-18th century, but was established in the 19th century itself when a club called Black Heath was formed in south-east London

 It was recently discovered that increasing the depth of the face made it easier to get high speed from dragflick and made the bow easier to execute strokes
 Firstly, after this feature was introduced, the Hockey Rules placed a limit of 50 mm on the maximum depth of the bow bow, but more than experience quickly demonstrated this to be excessive

 Ancient Nyayasutras first ten sutras in Sanskrit
jpg akshapaad, nyayasutra ke rachayita acharya
 The name of the creator of the famous jurist is named Maharishi Gautam or in the judiciary of Padmapuran, Skandapuran and Vishwanath
 iske vipareet nyaaybhashya, nyaayavarthik, taatparytika tathaa nyaayamanjari aadi vikhyath nyaayashastreey granthon main akshapaad in sutron ke lekhak maane gaye hai
 According to Mahakavi Bhasa, the name of the creator of jurisprudence is Medhatithi
 in vibhinn maton kii ek vaakyata siddh kii ja sakati he
 According to the Mahabharata, Gautama Medhatithi is the same person, not two different people
 gautam spashtatah vanshabodhak akhya he tathaa medhatithi vyaktibodhak sangya he
 Akshapada's semantics is - 'feet in the eye'
 faltah is naam ko sarthakata siddh karne ke liye anek kahaniyaan garh lee gai hai jo sarvatha kalpit, niraadhaar or pramaan shunya hai
 Many scholars have written about Naiyayik Gautama
 mahamahopadhyaay pan
 harprasad shastri kaa kahana he ki chini bhashaa main nibaddh pracheen bhartiya granthon ke anuwaad ke aadhaar par gautam, buddha ke pehle ho gaye the parantu unke naam par prachlit nyayasutra isa kii duusari shatabdi kii rachana he
 Satishchandra Vidyabhushan is of the opinion that the Gautami Dharmasutra and the Nyasutra Karta must have been the same Gautamnamdhari
 ye buddha ke samakaleen rahe honge tathaa inkaa samay 6thi shatabdi isa purv ho saktaa he
 But Vidyabhushan also believes that this Gautama may have composed only the first chapter of the Nyasutra
 baad ke chaar adhyay kisi or ne bahut baad main likhe honge
 Pro
 According to Yakobi, the Nyasutra must have been written after Nagarjuna was founded by nihilism and before the growth of scienceism because it denies nihilism but does not deny scienceism
 parantu pro
 sherwatski ke anusaar nyayasutra main vigyaanavaad kii ore bhi sanket kiya gaya he
 Hence, it will be composed after 500 AD
 parantu sherwatski kaa yah mat nyayasutra ko na samajhane ke kaaran bhramamoolak he
 According to Athalle and Bodas, the editors of Tarkasangraha, Gautama's Nyasutras precede Kanad

 If this is the minister of Mahapadma Nanda this year, then Gautam should be 400 BC

 According to Richard Garvey, justice is the oldest in theistic philosophies because there is no mention of it before the beginning of the year AD
 at: ye sutara 100-300 i
 ke bich likhe gaye honge
 It is absolutely impossible to say which of these opinions is correct
 nyaysutron kii rachana tathaa gautam kaa kaal in do prashnon par alag alag vichaar hona chahie
 As far as the Nyasutras are concerned, surely these sutras are written after the development of Buddhism
 itnaa or bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki is nyayasutra main samay-samay par sanshodhan tathaa parivardhan hote rahe hai
 But the name of Gautama is not related to these sutras because all these sutras in their present form are unfamiliar with Gautama
 gautam ko ham sirf nyaayashastra kaa pravartak kah sakate hai, sutron kaa rachayita nahin
 It may be that Gautama has written some sutras, but those sutras have become so mixed in other sutras that it is impossible for us to separate them
 in drushtiyon se hamen vidhyabhushan kaa mat adhik maanya lagata he
 Gautama is also known as Akshpad
 vidhyabhushan gautam ko akshapaad se pruthak maanate hai
 The commentators and other lecturers of the Nyasutra consider Akshpad and Gautama to be one
 'akshapaad' shabd kaa arth hota he 'jiske pair main ankhen hon'
 Grammar is familiar with the principles of Mahabhashya Gautama
 nyaysutron main paanch adhyay hai or ye hi nyaay darshan ke mul aadhaar granth he
 Their review shows that the judiciary was spiritually predominant in the beginning, that is, it was the objective to make a real decision on the nature of the soul
 tark tathaa yukti kaa yah sahaara avashya letaa tha, parantu aatma ke swaroop kaa parichay in sadhano ke dwaara karana hi iskaa mukhya taatpary tha
 The theory of that era was that the process which can gain knowledge of self-realization is right and valid
 usase vitarip maanya nahin hoti: But later, in the philosophy of justice, that logic system was specially introduced by which the soul's separation from the soul can be understood well and in which the means of litigation, jalp, vitanda, deceit, caste etc
 are used
 in tarkpradhan nyaysutron ke rachayita akshapaad prathit hote hai
 There is a clear reference to the achievement of the thoughts of both the eras in the current judgments
 nyaayadarshan ke mul rachayita gautam medhatithi hai or uske prati sanskrit-naveen vishyon kaa samavesh kar mul granth ke sanshodhak-akshapaad hai
 The famous treatise of Ayurveda, Charaka Samhita is also the culmination of this ritual system
 mul granth ke praneta maharishi agnivesh hai, parantu iske pratisanskarta charak maane jate hai
 Nyayasutra is likewise a text recited by Akshpad
 gautam nyaayashastra ke pravartak hai
 Examining the meaning on the basis of the evidence is called 'justice', hence it is mainly the evidence
 prameya kaa bhi is darshan main vichaar kiya gaya he par vah gaun ho gaya he
 What is knowledge, how it is produced, how many sources are there for its origin, who are the faults of those sources, their discussion is a matter of justice
 bhartiya parampara main 'nyaay' shabd angreji logic yaa tarkshastra kaa paryaayavachi he
 Buddhists and Jains have also practiced their rationale and they are also called Buddhnanya and Jaina
 par jahaan keval nyaay shabd kaa prayog hua he vahaan 'nyaay' se sampradaay dwaara pratipaadit siddhanton kaa hi grahan hota he
 The original book of this sect is Nyasutra which has five chapters and each chapter is divided into two temporals
 saare sutron kii sankhya 530 he
 The first chapter generally describes the 16 subjects which are detailed in the subsequent four chapters
 duusare adhyay main sanshay tathaa pramaanon kaa vivechan he
 The propounding themes of the third chapter are soul, body, senses, subjects of senses, knowledge and mind
 chaturth adhyay ichha, dukh, klesh or moksh ke swaroop kaa vivechan karte hue bhram ke swaroop tathaa avyav evam avyavi ke sambandh par bhi prakaash daalata he
 The fifth chapter discusses caste and exile
 pramaan, prameya, sanshay, prayojan, drushtaant, siddhant, avyav, tark, nirnay, vaad, jalp, vitanda, hetvabhaas, chal, jati, or nigrahasthaan in 16 vishyon ke tatvagyan se ni:shreyas kii prapti nyaayashastra main maani gai he
 Knowledge arises from these four evidences, direct, inference, subhuman and word
 vaisheshik darshan main sweekrut saat padaarthon kaa prameya main atanrbhaav ho jaataa he
 That is why the later lawyers have associated justice with Vaishyasik
 nyaay main mukhyat: vadavivaad kii paddati kaa varnan he
 How a theory is presented, how many objections can be made to the theory, how they can be avoided, these are the main manifestations of justice, it is said that Gautama was the first to prescribe a sentence with five components of inference
 Used
 greek darshanik arestu ke anusaar anumaan teen hi vaakyon main sampann hota he
 According to Vidyabhushan, the imaginary of the sentence in Indian justice has arisen from the influence of Aristotle
 parantu professor kith kaa mat he ki nyaay kii praarambhik avasthaa main greek vichaardhaara kaa prabhaav maanane kaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 Gautama's imagination of the Panchavayava sentence is a product of his brain
 bhartiya darshan prasthaanon main nyaay sambhavat: sabase adhik prabhaavshaalee prasthaan rahaa he
 The principles propounded in the Nyasutras were refuted by the Buddhist Acharya Nagarjuna
 nagarjun kaa uttar dene ke liye vatsyayan ne nyaysutron par bhashya kii rachana kii
 Udyotkar wrote judicially to refute the objections made by Buddhist naïveté Dinang over Vatsyayana
 nyaayavarthik par nyaayavarthik taatparytika tathaa usapar tikaparishuddhi kii rachana kramash: vachaspati mishra or udayan ne kii
 Apart from these texts, Nyayamanjari is an independent interpretation of the Nyasutras
 navyanyay ke pravartak gangeshopadhyaay ne tathaa unke anuyaayiyon ne bhi gautam dwaara pradarshit maarg kaa anusaran karte hue anek granth likhe
 The judiciary has influenced many Indian philosophies and inspired them by offering a rationale
 nyaay hi ek aisa sampradaay he jisapar aaj bhi panditon main vishad rup se charchaa chal rahi he
 It is difficult to say whether Gautama was an theist or not because there is no clear instruction of God in his sutras
 baad main ishwar kaa pratipaadan nyaay kii ek visheshta hi ho gai
 According to justice in salvation, the soul devoid of all its qualities and remains in its pure form
 buddhi, sukh, du:kha, ichha, dwesh, praytn or sanskaron se pare aatma jab du:khabhaav rup anand kii avasthaa main avasthit ho jaati he, use mukt kehete hai

 With the help of gases, the action of weldon is the same, but they are divided according to the gas in use
 ye gaisen bahudhaa oxigen or asitilin kaa mishran, kol gas or hydrogen aadi hua karti hai
 Of these, oxy-acetylene weldens are the most common
 veldonopayogi gaisen taiyaar karanevaali vyapaarik companiyaan ispaat ke majboot silinderon main gas ko kai vayumandalon ke dabaav par bharkar weldon ke liye bechaa karti hai
 This gas is produced at low pressures by mixing with calcium carbide and water by private gas generators in Weldon's large factories
 asitilin ko asitone main ghulaa dene se use visphoton kaa dar nahin rahata
 Regardless of the type of gas being treated, it is transported to the weldon by some kind of blower, with the help of a valve attached to which the flow of the gas is controlled and a flame of the appropriate size is created
 is
 chitra 4
 kii akruti k main phunkani ke munh par laganevaali ek chhucchhi kii banaavat dikhaai gai he or kha main lau kii akruti he
 To make the flame smaller, larger, thinner or thicker, jets of various sizes are interchangeably applied on the blower
 jet kii maap arthath uski takat prati ghanta gas ke kharche ke anusaar nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 The smallest jet consumes one cubic foot of gas in an hour and the largest jet consumes about 200 cubic feet of gas and the gas pressure is kept at 2 to 8 pounds per square inch
 prayog karte samay asitilin gas ko pehle kholkar jet ke munh par use jala diya jaataa he, phir oxigen ke silinder kaa balve dhire-dhire itnaa kholaa jaataa he ki jisase uchit prakaar kii lau ban jaae
 Due to excess acetylene in the mixture of burning gas, its flame becomes slightly thicker by carbureting, but it remains as bright as bright from beginning to end
 yadi mishran main oxigen kii adhikta ho, to lau oxikaarak prabhaav se yukt ho jaati he or uskaa sound lanbaa tathaa chamakdaar ho jaataa he, lekin donon prakaar kii gaison kii maatra main uchit samaayojan kar dene se jo lau banati he uske sound kaa chamakdaar bhaag chota or spasht akritiyukt hota he or usee kii nonk par sabase adhi taap hota he, jaisaa chitra 4
 main dikhaaya gaya he
 Therefore, the flame is kept about 1 / 8 inch to 1 / 16 inch away from the metal surface to melt the metal while welding
 weldon karte samay weldon kii janevaali vastuon ke takkaron ko milakar, upar se gas kii lau dwaara unako jod par galaa diya jaataa he jisase donon pruthak bhaagon kii dhaatuen apaas main galaakar mil jaati he or saath hi saath usee prakaar kii kuch phaltu dhaatu, jo patali battiyon ke rup main hoti he tathaa jise poorak yaa batti bhi kehete hai, galaakar bhar di jaati he or in sabake thandha ho jane par thos sandhi ban jaati he
 There are two tricks to blow a blower, one is the left hand and the other is the right hand
 baayein haath kii kriya main weldon kaa kaam dahini ore se bai ore ko badhata he jisase lau bina jhale hue bhaag kii taraf jhuki rahati he or phunkani ko daahine haath se thamkar batti ko baayein haath se thama jaataa he
 While welding, the blow makes an angle of 60 to 70 degrees and the metal light 30 to 40 degrees from the object to be welded
 daahine haath kii kriya main lau kaa munh jhale hue bhaag kii ore jhukaa rahata he or jhalaai kii kriya bai ore se dahini ore ko badhati he
 While belding with the left hand, the blow is run like a wave of water, and in the right hand weldon, the blow is run very rarely or not at all, but by turning the light into the shape of round rings
 batti kaa vyas veld kii janevaali vastu kii motaai or phunkani kii naap ke anupaat se hona chahie
 The thin light itself will melt quickly and the welded joint will not be able to get hot and melted
 yadi batti adhik moti hogi, to vah swayan der se galegi or vastu ke pehle se gale hue bhaagon ko jaldi se thanda kar degi
 The custom of this type of blowing is increasing nowadays
 isamen do lau ek saath nikalati hai, agevali lau to dhaatu ko agaau garam karne kaa kaam karti he, jisamen thodi adhik asitilin kharch ho jaati he lekin laabh yah hota he ki va carburikar hokar platon ko oxikaran hone se bachaa leti he, kyonki us samay platon main carbon kaa avasorana ho jane se unka dravnank ghat jaataa he or pichhali choti lau vahaan pahonchte hi saralata se apana kaam kar leti he
 This type of flame also reduces the defects of welding and twisting in the parts to be welding, and the welding work also happens quickly

 He also used to give his advice on those incidents

 He went to the forest for hunting one day
 unke jane ke baad hi unki patni rajaswala ho gai
 He sent this news to the king through his bird of prey
 samachar paakar maharaj sudhanva ne ek done main apana veery nikaal kar pakshi ko de diya
 The bird flew into the sky to bring the two to the king's wife
 maarg main us shikari pakshi ko ek duusari shikari pakshi mil gaya
 There was war between the two birds
 yuddh ke dauraan vah dona pakshi ke panje se chhot kar yamuna main ja gira
 In the Yamuna, there lived a nymph made of fish due to the curse of Brahma
 machhlee rupi apsara done main behate huye veery ko nigal gai tathaa uske prabhaav se vah garbhvatee ho gai
 On completion of the pregnancy, a Nishad trapped the fish in his net
 nishad ne jab machhlee ko chira to uske pet se ek balak tathaa ek balika nikali
 Nishad went to Maharaj Sudhanwa with those babies
 maharaj sudhanva ke putr na hone ke kaaran unhone balak ko apane paas rakh liya jiskaa naam matsayraj hua
 The girl remained near Nishad and was named Matsyagandha because the smell of fish emitted from her organs
 us kanya ko satyavati ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 When she grew up, she started doing boat work
 Once Parashar Muni had to sit on her boat and cross the Yamuna
 parashar muni satyavati rup-soundarya par aasakt ho gayi or bole, "devi! main tumhaare saath sahavaas karnaa chahta hoon
 "satyavati said," Muniver! You are a theologian and i am a Nishad girl
 hamaara sahavaas sambhav nahin he
 "then Parashar Muni said," Balike! Do not worry prasuti hone par bhi tum kumari hi rahogi
 "having said this, he created a thick mist network around his yoga force and indulged with Satyavati

 According to Hindu scriptures, Maharishi Vyasa was a trikala
 tathaa unhone divya drushti se dekh kar jaan liya ki kaliyug main dharm ksheen ho jaayegaa
 Due to the degeneration of religion, humans will become atheists, dutyless and young
 ek vishaal veda kaa sangopang adhyayan unke samarth se baahar ho jaayegaa
 That is why Maharishi Vyas divided the Vedas into four parts so that even those with less intelligence and less memory could study the Vedas
 vyas ji ne unka naam rakhaa - rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda
 Vyas ji became famous as Ved Vyas because of the division of Vedas
 rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda ko kramshah apane shishy pel, jaimin, vaishampayan or sumantumuni ko padhaayaa
 Veda Vyasa composed the Puranas in the form of the fifth Veda in which the knowledge of Veda is told in the form of interesting stories, because the knowledge contained in Veda is very esoteric and dry
 puraanon ko unhone apane shishy rome harshan ko padhaayaa
 Vyas ji's disciples made many branches and sub-branches of those Vedas according to their own wisdom
 vyas ji ne mahabharat kii rachana kii
 The great Vibhuti of the mythological-epic era, Mahabharata, Eighteen Puranas, Srimadbhagavata, Brahmasutra, Mimamsa, the founder of unique literature-philosophy, Ved Vyas, was born around 3000 BC on Ashada Purnima
 vedant darshan, advaitvaad ke sansthaapak vedavyas rishi parashar ke putr the

 There is a temple of Ved Vyas in the fort of Ramnagar and Vyas Nagar, where a fair is held every Monday in Magh
 guru poornima kaa prasiddh parv vyas ji kii jainti ke uplakshya main manaaya jaataa he
 The temple of Maharishi, the author of Puranas and Mahabharata, exists in Vyaspuri, which is located five miles from Kashi
 maharaj kaashi naresh ke ramnagar durg main bhi pashchim bhaag main vyaseshwar kii murti viraajman he jise saadhaaran janata chota vedavyas ke naam se jaanati he
 In fact, this is the most ancient idol of Ved Vyas
 vyasaji dwaara kaashi ko shaap dene ke kaaran vishweshwar ne vyasaji ko kaashi se nishkasit kar diya tha
 Then Vyasji was situated on the east bank of Gangaji in the fiery angle of the Lolark temple

 skanda puraana, kaashi khand 96 / 201 Vyasji, after creating Puranas and Mahabharata, also composed Brahmasutras here
 valmiki kii hi tarah vyas bhi sanskrit kaviyon ke liye upjivy hai
 Following the anecdotes in the Mahabharata, many Sanskrit poets have created poetry, drama etc
 mahabharat ke sambandh main swayan vyasaji kii hi ukti adhik sateek he- is granth main jo kuch he, vah anyatra he, panratu jo isamen nahin he, vah anyatra kahin bhi nahin he
 He was born in an island of Yamuna in Kalpi
 vyasaji krishna dwaipayan kahalaaye kyonki unka rang shyaam tha
 As soon as he was born, he went to do penance with the mother's command and said that whenever you will remember, i will come
 ve dhritarashtra, pandu tathaa vidura ke janmdata hi nahin, apitu vipatti ke samay ve chaaya kii tarah pandavon kaa saath bhi dete the
 He wrote the Mahabharata Granth with three years of tireless hard work - tribhirvarshe: sadotthai krishnadwaipyanomuni:
 Mahabharatmakhyan kritwadi mudtamam
 
 Adiparva - jab inhone dharm kaa hraas hote dekha to inhone veda kaa vyas arthath vibhaag kar diya or vedavyas kahalaaye
 After studying the Vedas, he taught his disciples Sumantu, Jaimini, Pal and Vaishampayan, and his son Shukadeva, and preached the Mahabharata
 aapaki is alokik pratibha ke kaaran aapako bhagwaan kaa avatar mana jaataa he
 Vyasa has become the best poet in Sanskrit literature after Valmiki
 inke likhe kavy 'aarsh kavy' ke naam se vikhyath hai
 The purpose of Vyas ji is not to describe the war by writing Mahabharata, but to show the essence of this physical life
 unka kathan he ki bhale hi koi purush vedang tathaa upanishdon ko jaan le, lekin vah kabhi vichkshan nahin ho saktaa kyonki yah mahabharat ek hi saath arthshaastra, dharamshastra tathaa kaamshaastra he
