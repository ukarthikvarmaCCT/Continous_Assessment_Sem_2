 After the arrival of Champaran on 15 April 1917, Gandhiji had only to lose Babu Saheb to start his work
 16 april kii subah jasauli ke liye chal padey jahaan kisaan andolan ko kuchalane ke liye inke saath damanaatmak karwai kii gai thi
 At that time, there was no more suitable land for Chamji than Champaran where he could put the seeds of Satyagraha

 Gandhiji was firm in his tune and Babu Lomraj Singh was also strong in his intention
 sarkari pratibandh se dono main kisi kaa uddeshy baadhit nahin hua
 Gandhiji returned to Motihari, the district headquarters to deal with self-government from Chandrahiya en route, but sent his aides Ramnavami Prasad, Dharnidhar Prasad, both lawyers and others to Jasoli to initiate the Champaran Satyagraha
 babu sahib ne unhen lekar jasauli aae
 Where they saw the oppressive actions taken against Babu Saheb and heralding the Champaran Satyagraha, recorded the first statement of the farmers at his door and made a book which later became the grandson of the Champaran Satyagraha within a month

 There was a spark of protest in him, but they were looking for an opportunity to make him a Shola

 Meanwhile, the present Western Champaran farmers Sheikh Gulab and Sheetal Rai, Peer Mohammad Munish etc
 arose to take on the British but they were suppressed

 babu sahib to lambe samay se angrejon se kanoonee ladaai lard rahe the lekin inhen samuchit safalataa nahin mil rahi thi
 The wastage of money in the case was also touching the limit, in which Babu Saheb had to lose his Motihari lawyer Toli only to the fees of Saheb, the urban housing lawyer

 He made the Tirhut commissioner a bulwark against the increased revenue with signatures of seven hundred peasants, but it exploded when Pt Raj Kumar Shukla joined the movement and got the wisdom of Babu Saheb's lawyer Babu Gorakh Prasad in it
 gorakh babu ne hi in logon ko gandhi dwaara da0 africa main kiye gayi kaaryon kii jaankaree tathaa suzav diya kii agar ve champaran kii sthiti aakar dekh len to yahan kaa bhi uddhaar ho jaay
 For this, a batch of farmers under the leadership of Pt
 Shukla went to participate in the Lucknow Congress from Champaran, in which Babu Lomraj Singh supported tan-man-dhan
 gandhi ji champaran kaise aaye yah to sarvavidit he lekin yah itihaas ke pannon main dab kar rah gaya he ki patane kii takalif ke baad jab gandhi ji magan laal ko patr likh kar apana kaarykram badal kar lautne kii taiyaari kar rahe the to babu lomraj singh hi aise aadmi the jinhone gandhi ji se kaha tha ki unhone apana sab kuch ganvaaya he gandhi kii aashaa or vishwaas par agar gandhi champaran nahin gaye to ve ganga nadi main kud kar aatmahatya kar lenge parantu lok vishwaas ganvaane champaran nahin jaayenge or gandhi ji ko apana man badal kar champaran aana padaa tha phir jo hua yah bhi sabhi jaanate hai

 Norman of Pipra had told Collector Mr
 Hekauk that it is difficult to find any witness against Sooraj and informed the officials of the popularity of Collector Lomraj Singh by his letter and outlined the situation of the peasant movement in Champaran
 babu sahib kaa manobal tab ucch ho gaya jab pan0 rajkumaar shukla samay se kalakate gandhi ji ko laane prasthaan kar gayi
 At the same time Mr
 Kaunp, the sire of Jagiran Kothi, also came in front of him to break his morale
 tab apni bansavari se angrejon ke aadamiyon ko baans kaatane ki soochna milte hi babu sahib unhen rokane ke liye nihathe chal diye or inke peeche padaa jan sailaab
 On which Mr

 Babu Lomraj Singh made the promise made to Gandhiji in Patne on April 18, 1917, during the trial hearing in the court of Motihari, in support of 10,000 farmers of Pipra and Turkouliya region
 babu sahib kii yaheen saakh thi ki mahatma gandhi 1934 main bukamp kii barvaadi dekhne aaye to unhone unki tathaa pan0 shukla kii khoj kii lekin tab tak ve log divegat ho gayi the

 chand shabd anek arthon main prayukt kiya jaataa he
 "chhandas" is a synonym of Veda
 saamanytah varnon or matraaon kii geyavyavastha ko chand kaha jaataa he
 The word verse is also used in the same sense
 padya adhik vyapak arth main prayukt hota he
 In the language, words and words have letters and vowels
 inhen ko ek nishchit vidhaan se suvyavasthit karne par chand kaa naam diya jaataa he
 Chhandashastra is therefore considered to be a very strong scripture because it is based on mathematics
 vastut: dekhne par aisa prathit hota he ki chandashastra kii rachana isaliye kii gai jisase agrim santati iske niyamon ke aadhaar par chhandrachana kar sake
 It is also known from looking at the scriptures of the verses that while on the one hand the Acharya continued to develop the verses through the prasasti, on the other hand, the poets, while changing a few verses on their own behalf, created new verses, which in the texts of the verses of time, Incorporated
 chandashastra kii rachana kab hui, is sambandh main koi nishchit vichaar nahin diya ja saktaa
 Legend has it that Maharishi Valmiki is a primordial poet and his poetry called Ramayana is primordial
 maa nishad pratishtha tvan gam: shashwati samaa: yatkronchamithunadekamvadhi:, kammohitan - yah anushtup chand valmiki ke mukh se niklaa hua pratham chand he jo shok ke kaaran sahasaa shloke ke rup main prakat hua
 If this legend is to be believed, the verses were composed first and the verses came after that
 valmikiy ramayana main anushtup chand kaa prayog adyopant hua hi he, anya upjati aadi kaa bhi prayog prachur maatra main praapt hota he
 Another legend is that the original inventor of the scripture is God
 ek baar garud ne unhen pakad liya
 Sheshi said that we have a unique learning which you should learn, then eat us
 garud ne kaha ki aap bahaane banaate hai or swaraksharth hamen vibhramit kar rahe hai
 Sheshi replied that we do not make untrue speech
 isapar garud ne sweekaar kar liya or shesh unhen chandashastra kaa upadesh karne lage
 Describing the verses of various verses, at the end, the rest stated the rule of "bhujangaprayati", and soon entered the sea
 garud ne isapar kaha ki tumne hamen dhokhaa diya, shesh ne uttar diya ki hamane jane ke purv aapako soochna de di
 The quadrilateral form Bhujangaprayati means Bhujang Prayat verses from four ganas and is used
 is prakaar chandashastra kaa aavirbhaav hua
 It appears from this
 ki chandashastra ek daivi vidya ke rup main prakat hua
 Thus it can also be said that its inventor was Sheshacharya, named Sheshi, who does not have any special knowledge and information about it at this time
 iske pashchaat kaha jaataa he ki shesh ne avatar lekar pingalacharya ke rup main chandsutra kii rachana kii, jo pingalashastra kaha jaataa he
 This book is written in sutra style and is available till this time
 isapar tikaayen tathaa vyakhyaayein ho chuki hai
 This is considered to be the first book of the scriptures
 iske pashchaat is shaastra par sanskrit sahitya main anek granthon kii rachana hui
 The authors of the verses can be divided into two categories: the Acharya category, which gives a classical representation of the verses and the poet category, which presents separate works on the verses
 thode samay ke pashchaat ek lekhak shrenee or prakat hui jinamein aise lekhak aate hai jo chhandon ke niyamadikon kii vivechna apni ore se karte hai kintu udhaaharan duusare ke rache hue tathaa prachlit anshon se uddhrut karte hai
 In Hindi too, many texts have been written on Chhandasastra
 chandashastra main mukhya vivechy vishay do hai : There are mainly two types of verses: jinka prayong vedon main praapt hota he
 These include the four types of vowels, namely "anushtupa", such as Harsva, Long, Plut and Swarna
 vaidic chand apaurushey maane jate hai
 They are used under murder, but in fact the proverbial verses are those verses which are propagated in the general public or community
 ye chand kisi nishchit niyam par aadhaarit na hokar visheshat: taal or lay par hi aadhaarit rahete hai, isaliye inaki rachana saamaanya apathit jan bhi kar lete hai
 Cosmic verses refer to those verses that are composed on the basis of certain rules and which are used by well-versed poets in poetry
 in loukik chhandon ke rachana-vidhi-sambandhi niyam suvyavasthit rup se jis shaastra main rakhe gaye hai use chandashastra kehete hai
 The verses are divided on the basis of characters and quantities
 chand prathmat: do prakaar ke maane gaye he : varnik or maatrik
 The number of circles in these remains fixed
 iske do bhi prakaar hai- ganaatmak or aganaatmak
 The negative verses are also called circles
 inaki rachana teen laghu or deergh ganon se bane hue ganon ke aadhaar par hoti he
 If the arrangement of letters is arranged with the idea of short and long, eight forms are formed
 inhen ko "aath gana" kehete hai inamen bha, na, m, ya shubh gana maane gaye hai or ja, r, sa, t ashubh maane gaye hai
 The use of the first four ganas in the beginning of a sentence is appropriate, the use of the last four is prohibited
 yadi ashubh ganon se prarambh honevaale chand kaa hi prayog karnaa he, devatavachi yaa mangalvaachi varna athwa shabd kaa prayog pratham karnaa chahie - isse gandosh dur ho jaataa he
 These ganas are considered to be mutual friends, enemies and indifferent expressions
 chand ke aadi main do ganon kaa mail mana gaya he
 There is also a rule to consider the characters as short and long
 laghu swar athwa ek matraavaale varna laghu athwa hrasv maane gaye or isamen ek maatra maani gai he
 The short letter preceding the combined letters with long vowels is also considered as long and the letter with the discord and the letter of the verse are long
 aganaatmak varnik vrutt ve hai jinamein ganon kaa vichaar nahin rakhaa jaataa, keval varnon kii nishchit sankhya kaa vichaar rahata he vishesh maatrik chhandon main keval matraaon kaa hi nishchit vichaar rahata he or yah ek vishesh lay athwa gati par aadhaarit rahete hai
 Therefore these verses are rhythmic
 varnik chhandon main varna ganon ke hisaab se rakhe jate hai
 The group of three varnas is called gana
 in ganon ke naam hai: yagan, magan, tagan, ragan, jagan, bhagan, nagan or sagan
 Small alone is called 'L' and Guru is called 'C'
 kis gana main laghu-guru kaa kya kram he, yah jaanane ke liye nimnlikhit sutara sahaayak hota he- Seeing the character of the Gan, in this, add the next two letters together and apply the quantities of Gan in the same order, such as: matraaon main jo akeli maatra he, us ke aadhaar par inhen adilaghu yaa aadiguru kaha gaya he
 In which everyone is a Guru, he is called 'magan' Sarvaguru and all are short, 'nagan' is called Sarvalaghu
 sanskrit main adhiktar varnik chhando kaa hi gyaan karaayaa jaataa he; maatrik chhandon kaa kam
 In Sanskrit its name is 'dohadika' verses
 iske visham charnon main teraa-teraa or sam charnon main gyaarah-gyaarah matraayen hoti hai
 In odd feet etc
 
 There should not be this type of quantity-order and at the end there should be gurus and minor characters
 sam charnon kii tuk aapas main milani chahie
 like: is dohe ko pehali pankti main visham or sam donon charnon par matraachihn laga die hai
 Similarly, in the second line also you can put these signs on both the steps
 atah doha ek ardhasam maatrik chand he
 There are 28 quantities in each stage in Harigitika verses and at the end there should be mini and then Guru Varna
 isamen yeti 16 tathaa 12 matraaon ke baad hoti hai; jaise Each phase in this verse has twenty-six volumes and is followed by 14 and 12 quantities
 jaise: The division of verses is based on different numbers of phantoms of quantities and characters
 is prakaar chand sam, visham, ardhasam hote he
 In even stanzas, the varna varsha remains the same in all four phases of the stanza
 ardhasam main pratham, tritiy or dwitiya tathaa chaturth main varnaswar sankhya samaan rahati he
 The number of letters and vowels in all the four phases of the odd stanza remains uneven
 ye varna paraspar pruthak hote hai varnon or matraaon kii kuch nishchit sankhya ke pashchaat bahusankhyak varnon ou swaron se yukt chand dandak kahe jate he
 Their number is very high
 chando kaa vibhaajan phir anya prakaar se bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Independent verses and mixed verses
 swatantra chand ek hi chand vishesh niyam se rachaa hua rahata he
 There are two types of mixed verses: doha or rola ke milaane se dohe ke chaturth charan kii aavriti uske pratham charan ke aadi main kii jaati he or dohe ke praarambhik kuch shabd role ke ant main rakhe jate hai
 The second type of compound verse is "chappay" in which four stages are given by roll and two are given by Ullala
 isiliye ise shatpadi athwa chappay kaha jaataa he
 From his view, it is known that the development of verses is not only on the basis of prevalence but also on the basis of verses-mixing method by poets
 isi prakaar kuch chand kisi ek chand ke vilom rup ke bhav se aae hai jaise dohe kaa vilom soratha he
 It seems that poets have often made new verses by converting them into two verses or by increasing the volume in the same verse
 yah chand prastaar ke antargat aa saktaa he
 a phase of larger verses, except for short verses, when it cannot be read at once, determines the place where the composition stops
 is viramsthal ko yeti kehete hai
 With the idea of yeti, verses again become of two types - chand main sangeet tatv dwaara laalitya kaa puraa vichaar rakhaa gaya he
 Often all the verses become lyrical in one form or the other
 raag or raagini vaale sabhi pad chhandon main nahin kahe ja sakate
 That is why certain posts are composed under the name "geeti"
 praaia: sangitatmak padon main swar ke aaroh tathaa avaroh main bahudhaa laghu varna ko deergh, deergh ko laghu or alp laghu bhi kar liya jaataa he

 and the rule of the Sangh started changing gradually

 tab tak congress bhartiya raajnneetik kaa sabase bada sanghathan ban chukaa tha
 Like ordinary moderates, Jinnah did not demand any time for the independence of India, instead he kept demanding from the British for better education, law, industry, employment etc
 in the country

 This council had no authority and included many European and British government devotees

 In 1919 she gave birth to her only child, Dina
 jinna kaa congress se matbhed usee samay shuru ho gayi the jab 1918 main bhartiya raajnneeti main gandhiji kaa udai hua
 Gandhiji promoted non-violent civil disobedience and Hindu values in politics
 gandhiji ke anusaar, satya, ahimsa or savinay avagya se swatantrata or swashaasan paaya ja saktaa he, jabaki jinna kaa mat unase alag tha
 Jinnah believed that freedom can be achieved only by constitutional struggle
 
 congress ke duusare netaaon se alag, gandhiji videshi kapade nahin pahante the, angreji kii jagah zyada se zyada hindi kaa prayog karte the or sanathan hindu chintan kaa hi prayog raajnneeti main karte the
 These were some of the reasons that Gandhiji gained immense popularity
 gandhi ji ne khilaafat andolan kaa samarthan kiya tha jabaki jinna ne iskaa khulkar virodh kiya
 Jinnah believed that this would promote religious fundamentalism
 1920 main jinna ne congress ke istipha de diya
 Along with this, he also warned that the principle of mass struggle of Gandhiji will not reduce the division between Hindus and Muslims
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki isse donon samudaayon ke andar bhi jabardasht vibhaajan paidaa hoga
 Jinnah drew the dividing line between the Congress and the British supporters as soon as he became President of the Muslim League

 The two later reached an agreement, known as the fourteen sutras of Jinnah
 haalanki ise congress or duusari raajnneetik partiyon ne baad main khaarij kar diya
 His personal life, especially his marital life, was affected due to overwork in political work
 haalanki unhone apane vaivaahik jivan ko bachaane ke liye europe kii yatra bhi kii, lekin 1927 main pati or patni alag ho gayi
 In 1929, his wife died after a serious illness, after which Jinnah continued to remain unhappy
 us dauraan ve zyada yatraayen karne kii haalat main nahin the, lekin unhen bhartiya musalamaanon ke adhikaron ko lekar kaaphi chintaayen sata raheen thim
 He was also sad to see the dissolution of the Round Table Conference in London

 Jinnah returned to India in 1934 and reorganized the league
 us dauraan liyakat ali khan unke daahine haath kii tarah kaam karte the
 In the 1937 Central Legislative Assembly elections, the Muslim League gave a tough fight to the Congress and captured most of the seats in the Muslim areas
 haalanki is chunaav main muslim bahul punjab, sindh or pashchimottar seemaant praant main use karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Jinnah invited Congress for alliance
 pehle to donon ne faisla kiya ki ve angrejon se milakar muqabla karenge, lekin jinna ne shart rakkhi ki congress ko musalamaanon ke liye pruthak nirvachan kshetra or muslim lig ko bharat ke musalamaanon kaa pratinidhi maananaa hoga, jise congress ne asweekaar kar diya
 There were many Muslim leaders in the Congress at that time, so it was not easy for him to consider the League as representative of Indian Muslims
 jinna ne kai congress netaaon se baatcheet bhi kii or congress ne lig ko congress main vilay karne kaa prastaav bhi pesh kiya parantu vaarta phir bhi vifal ho gayi
 Jinnah was roaming around India and giving speeches
 1930 main muslim lig ke ek bhaashan main mohammad ikbaal ne uttar pashchim bhartiya rajya aar jur diya tha na kii pakistan desh kii
 In 1933, Rahmat Ali printed the pamphlet and renamed the country as Pakistan
 congress ke saath vaarta vifal hone ke baad jinna ko bhi yah vichaar aayaa ki musalamaanon ko apane adhikaron kii raksha ke liye ek alag desh milanaa hi chaiye bina iske kaam nahin banegaa
 Later, Jinnah became absolutely convinced that both Hindus and Muslims are citizens of different countries, so they should be separated
 unka yahi vichaar baad main jaakar jinna ke dvirashtrawaad kaa siddhanth kahalaaya
 Jinnah said that injustice would be done to Muslims in India and in the end civil war would spread
 yah baat jinna ne ikbaal ke saath patrachaar main bhi uthaayi
 a resolution passed in the 1940 Lahore session stating that the main objective of the Muslim League is the creation of Pakistan
 congress ne is prastaav ko asweekaar kar diya
 Leaders like Maulana Abbul Kalam Azad and organizations like jamaat-islami strongly condemned it
 26 july 1943 ko khaksaar ugravadiyon ke hamale main jinna ghayal ho gayi
 Jinnah founded the Don newspaper in 1941, through which he propagated his idea
 jinna ne dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan britain kii madad kii thi or 1942 main unhone bharat chodo aandolan kaa virodh kiya tha
 After the death of Unionist leader Alexander Hayat Khan, the Muslim League's dominance in Punjab also increased
