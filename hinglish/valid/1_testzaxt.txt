 He founded the 'peer of Developing Society Studies' in 1963
 yah dilli main sthit samaaj vigyaan tathaa manviki se sambandhit anusandhan kaa santhaan he
 In 1980, he also founded an institution called 'lokayan'
 bharat ke pramukh raajnneetishastri or vikasshil samaaj adhyayan peeth ke sansthaapak rajani kothaari ne pichhali aadhi sadi main bhartiya raajnneeti ke siddhantikaran main abhootpurv yogadan kiya he
 Kothari has mainly added two notable installations in the study of party systems
 dwidaleey or bahudaleey pranaaliyon kii prachlit vyakhyaaon se alag hat kar unhone bhartiya daleey pranali kii ek party ke varchasv vaali pranali ke rup main moulik vyakhya kii; or congress ko prachlit paribhaashaon ke tahat ek raajnneetik dal ke rup main dekhne ke bajaay congress ‘pranali’ ke rup main pesh kiya
 Later, Kothari also contributed to the theorization of non-party politics
 jati-pratha or aadhunik sansadeey raajnneeti ke bich anyonyakriya dekhne kii kothaari kii drushti bhi anuthi sabit hui
 His first formulation in this regard is that the path of modernization of a traditional society like India actually goes through the politicization of social structures
 isi se judaa hua doosraa sutrikaran yah he ki jis parighatna ko ham raajnneeti main jatvaad qaraar dete hai, vah darasal jatiyon kaa raajnneetikaran he jiske kaaran jatigat sanrachanaon kaa swaroop bheetar se badal rahaa he
 Kothari has been a rich creator
 unki pehali pustak 1969 main politics in india prakashit hui thi jo bhartiya raajnneeti ko samajhane kaa tarkpurna model pesh karti he
 Rajni Kothari was born into a prosperous Gujarati trading house
 unke pita burma main hiron kaa vyapaar karte the
 His early education took place in a school in Rangoon run by the Ayangars
 parivaar main bauddhikta kii koi parampara na hone ke baavjood kothaari ke pita ne unhen sushikshit karne main koi kasar na chodi
 His childhood was spent in a relatively open society in Burma
 ghar kii chhaton par hone vaale samuhik nrityon, mongol or buddha samskruti ke mili-jule lubhaavne rup, dakshin bhartiya chettiyaaron, gujarati baniyon, voharaaon, khojaaon or musalmaan vyapaariyon ke mishrit bhartiya samudaay ke bich guzaare gayi shuruaati varshon ne unhen ek udaar maanas pradaan kiya
 After getting higher education from London School of Economics, Rajni Kothari taught classical economics in Vadodara for a few days
 is dauraan ve bhartiya marxvad ke praarambhik vyaakhyaata or baad main radical maanavtawaad ke pramukh pravaktaa maanavendra nath raay se bhi prabhavit hue
 In the last phase of his life, Prof
 Kothari, who is hurt by the death of wife Hansa Kothari and elder son Smitu Kothari, spends his time in Delhi residence
 rajani kothaari ke bauddhik jivan ko teen bhaagon main baant kar samajha ja saktaa he
 In the beginning of his political thought, Kothari preferred factual analysis of Indian society and politics
 khaas baat yah he ki is prakriya main ve pratyakshvaadi ravaiye se prabhavit nahin hue
 This period was when the Nehru era was looking towards its blockade in the sixties
 yah ek sankramanakalin samay tha jisamen loktantr ke kshay or naash kii bhavishyavaaniyan ho rahi thim
 It was in this environment that Kothari played a major role in identifying the uniqueness of the model of Indian democracy
 us samay adhiktar samaaj-vigyaani bhartiya anubhav ko pashchimi loktantron ke anubhav kii roshni main dekhne kii koshish kar rahe the
 At the same time Rajni Kothari joined the National Community Development Institute on the encouragement of sociologist Shyama Charan Dubey
 unhone apane field work ke dauraan puure desh kaa saghan daura kiya
 He also went to areas where it was generally considered difficult to go
 is anubhav ne unhen badalte hue yaa badalane ke liye taiyaar bharat ke darshan karaaye
 Then, under a happy coincidence, he got a chance to see a Congress session in Bhavnagar
 unheen dinon tatkaaleen iconomic vikali ke chah ankon main unki ek lekhamala chhapi jiskaa sheershak tha ‘bhartiya raajnneeti kaa rup or saar’
 These articles deposited his steps in the world of political science
 inamen kramshah centre-rajya sambandh, panchayat raaj, sarkaar ke sansadeey rup, afasarshahi, daleey pranali or ant main loktantr ke bhavishya par gahan charchaa kii gayi thi
 The theoretical framework that was used in this article, he later laid the foundation of Kothari's detailed speech
 in lekhon kii prakruti vivaadaatmak thi
 He introduced a three-pronged criterion, one of which was one of the valid principles of democracy, the other was the democratic experience of the Western world and the third was the uniqueness of the Indian experience
 isse pehle raajnneetishastra main sansthagat or samvidhangat adhyayan hi hua karte the
 It was a unique look to see the development of politics
 in lekhon main laski ke siddhanton se lekar jaiprakash narayan kii vikendrikaran kii thisis par aalochanatmak tippaniyan thim
 After this Kothari, armed with his theoretical skills, repeatedly went to the common Indian through surveys and found out how our democracy is working on the ground
 is tarah loktantr kii bhartiya kism ke vikaas ke adhyayan ke thos aadhaaron kaa sutrikaran hone kii sambhaavnaayen khuleen
 Kothari formulated a whole series of principles and sub-principles, which he used repeatedly as a key, proved that the kind of democracy being created in India would be different from the democracies of the West
 samaroopikaran karne vaale raashtra- rajya par aadhaarit na ho kar yah loktantr bhartiya samskruti dwaara pradutt bahultawad ko apni buniyaad banaayegaa
 Kothari's famous formulations related to the party system are the result of this period
 unhone dikhaaya ki bhartiya daleey pranali na to viksit poonjeewaadi deshon kii tarah do yaa teen dalon kii raajnneetik pratiyogita vaali pranali ke model main fit hoti he, na hi isamen kisi bahudaleey pranali kii araajakta he
 He also did not agree with the observation of Western observers that India should be considered as a party system due to Congress dominating political life
 balki, unka kahana tha ki yahan dal to kai hai, par bolbalaa ek dal kaa he
 And, this domination works as a system in which not only the ruling structures are processed, but also the opposition structures continue to play their role
 isi daur main kothaari ne jati-pratha or aadhunik sansadeey loktantric raajnneeti ke bich len-dein kaa baarik kaakaa pesh kiya
 He said that by participating in politics, caste-communities do not pollute democracy, but are forced to give priority to their already existing secular forms by becoming quite free from the clutches of their ritualistic form
 kothaari kii duusare daur kii rachanaayen us samay kii hai jab indira gandhi kii karishmai raajnneeti apane loklubhaavan or nirankush rujhaanon ke saath bhartiya raajnneeti kaa swaroop badalane par tuli hui thim
 Initially, Kothari felt that under the leadership of Indira Gandhi, there was a possibility to launch radical changes
 lekin jaldi hi unhen dikhaai de gaya ki rajya kii jis sanstha ko maanav-mukti kii aitihaasik zimmedaari puri kerani he, vah na keval bharat main loktantr ko samrudh karne se munh chura rahi he, balki duniya bhar main uski yah bhoomika saansat kaa shikaar banati ja rahi he
 He also contributed to the policy structure of the anti-congress Janata Party in 1977, after abstaining from any form of cooperation with Indira Gandhi during the Emergency
 janata prayog ke vifal ho jane or satta main indira gandhi vaapasi ke baad kothaari ne apni rachanaaon main duniya ke paimaane par uttar banaam dakshin yani viksit banaam aviksit kaa dwandv rekhaankit karte hue rajya or chunavi raajnneeti ke pare jane kii tajavijein viksit karne kii koshish shuru kii
 At this point, he contributed to the theorization of non-party politics
 kothaari kii srujanshiltaa kaa yah doosraa daur khaasaa lambaa sabit hua
 He resorted to Gandhi's ideas challenging the civilizational paradigms of the West and tried to introduce a new utopia
 apane isi daur main rajani kothaari ne mahaz buddhijivi rahane ke bajaay saamaajik- raajnneetik kaaryakarta kii bhoomika bhi grahan kii
 He participated in a study program called Lokayan founded by his associate scholar Dhirubhai Sheth with the aim of connecting non-party political structures with the world of sociology
 inhen varshon main kothaari pipuls union of civil liberties ke rashtriya adhyaksh bhi rahe
 In the third phase of his creation, Kothari tried to create an alternative politics without dismissing the ideological structure of modernism
 darasal, unka yah charan aalochanatmak hone ke saath- saath atmalochanatmak bhi tha
 He looked closely at many of his efforts in the past and found that non-party politics is not really developing into alternative politics
 udaarataavaad, marxvad, gandhivaad or naye saamaajik andolanon kii parighatna bhartiya loktantr ke badalte hue chehre kii vyakhya karne main asamarth he
 At this stage, Kothari used his classical talent to formulate Dalit-backward politics and to form an intellectual blockade against the forces of globalization at the international level
 unhone rajya kii sanstha main aayi vikrutiyon kii shinaakht kii or use janonmukata se vanchit prabandhkeey-takaneekashahi pravritiyon vaala rajya qaraar diya
 He showed how this state, contrary to the prevailing theoretical understanding, is intolerant of variations, marginalizing the poor and forgetting and keeping pace with communal politics

 The remaining provision of the glass-steagall Act - which was enacted after the Great Depression - prohibited banks from merging with insurance underwriters and meant that Citigroup had time between two and five years to recover any Disinvestment of prohibited property
 However, Weil said at the time of the merger that he believed "that the legislation will change after that time 


 We have discussed enough to gain the confidence that this will not become a problem"
 Indeed, the passage of the gramm-leach-bliele Act in November 1999 confirmed the views of Reid and Weil, which opened the way for the financial services organization to offer a mix of commercial banking, investment banking, insurance risk marking and brokerage

 Gucci - This well-known name is very famous in Italy for fashion and leather products
 yah 'da house of guchi ' yani guchi samooh kaa hi hissaa he or iske maalik hai - pinault-printemps - ridoot naamak francisi company
 guchi kii sthapana 1921 main, florence main, guchio guchi dwaara kii gayi thi
 According to 'business Week' magazine, Gucci grossed around € 2

 italy main utpaadit utpaadanon main guchi kaa naam atyadhik bikri ke liye vishwa bhar main mashhoor he
 Globally, Gucci has a total of 278 self-operated stores spread across the world, as well as selling its products through authorized dealers and high-end 'department stores'
 1921 main guchio guchi ne 'guchi' company kii sthapana kii
 In 1938 Goochie expanded and a boutique opened in Rome
 company ke anek utpaadanon kii pariklpana main guchio kaa bahut bada haath tha
 In 1947, Gucci began production of bamboo-handled handbags which are still among the company's flagship products
 1950 ke dashak ke dauraan, guchi ne patali kaathiyon se prerit - patali dhaariwaali bunaaidaar kinaariyon or talue main dhaatu-jadit 'sued mokasin' kaa vikaas kiya jo unki khaas chhap - yani 'trademark' ban gaya
 Guchio's wife, Ida Calverley, belonged to a large family, but the company's business could only be assigned to her sons - Vasco, Aldo, Yugo, and Rodolfo
 1953 main guchio kii mrityu ke baad, eldo ke netritv main company ko antarrashtriya str par pramukhataa mili or company ne new york main apana pehla boutique kholaa
 shuru-shuru main rhodolpho ne abhinay ko apana kariyar banane kii koshish to kii lekin jald hi company kii zimmedaariyaan sanbhaalane laut aayaa
 Even during Gucci's inexperienced years, Guccio's family was notorious for their familial infighting
 uttaradhikaar, ansh-dhaaran, tathaa stores ke suchalan ke dainandin maamalon ko lekar parivaar ke sadasyon main aksar vaad-vivaad, man-mutaav hota jisase sadasyon main foot padati or gathbandhan hone lagata

 1960 dashak ke aakhri varshon main guchi kaa lakshya tha - sudur purvi deshon main apana vistaar karnaa or is lakshya ko puraa kiya - hong kong tathaa tokio main apane stores khol kar
 usee samay company ne apana vikhyath chinh GG ke prachlan ke saath-saath, in utpaadon kaa utpaadan bhi shuru kiya - reshmi scorf flaura - jo hollywood kii abhinetri gres kaili kii khaas pasand thi, tathaa jaiki kennedy or o sholder bag - jisko mashhoor banaaya amareeki raashtrapati jon eff kennedy kii patni - jaiki kennedy ne! For almost the entire decade of the 1970s, Gucci's name remained world-renowned in major, luxurious and royalty-producing establishments, but then the company was on the verge of bankruptcy due to some disastrous business decisions and family conflicts
 Hui
 us vakt company ke shares main eldo or rhodolpho donon bhaaiyon kii saajhedaari baraabar kii - yani 50% kii thi
 But compared to Aldo and his sons, Rodolfo's contribution to the company was little
 1979 main, eldo ne 'guchi accesris collection' yaa GAC kii sthapana kii, jiskaa uddeshy tha - uske apane beton dwaara niyantrit guchi parfums vibhaag ko sahaara dena
 GAC main bas chote-mote upsaadhan hi shaamil the - jaise: cosmetic bags, liters or pen - jinaki keemat bahut kam hoti thi or jo company ke accesris catlog main anya keemtee vastuon ke mukaable kaaphi nichle sthaan par darshaae jate the
 With the intention of weakening Rodolfo's control throughout the company's operations, Aldo delegated the entire responsibility of the perfumes department to his son Roberto
 haalanki guchi accesris collection ko acchhee-khaasi manyata mili, par yahi guchi vansh kii barbaadi kaa kaaran bhi sabit hui
 Within a few years, the earnings of the perfumes department started to exceed the earnings of the accessories department
 With this new dimension of wholesale-trade, gac-products, once found in specialty stores, now became available in more than a thousand stores in the US, reducing its reputation among fashionable customers
 Graidian Carter, editor of Vanity Fer, writes, "in the 1960s and 1970s, the demand for Gucci products was high among modern women and is attributed to Audrey Hebburn, Grace Kelly, and Jacqueline Oasis
 But by the 1980s, Gucci had his own Lost its charm and became an unsightly product found at airports
 " Soon, fake and cheap goods in the name of Gucci started to come in the market, which further shocked Gucci's reputation
 Meanwhile, in Italy, family feuds were having a bad effect on the company's business
 rhodolpho or eldo parfums vibhaag ko lekar lard rahe the, haalanki usamen rhodolpho kaa hissaa keval 20% tha
 Meanwhile, Aldo's son Paolo Goucci introduced a cheap product adapted as 'goochie Plus' and in 1983 he split from the family
 baat yahaan tak pahunchi ki bordroom kii ladaai main hathapayee hui or paolo, apane hi ek bhai ke haathon telephone ancering mashin kii chot khaakar behosh ho kar gir padaa
 badale main usne, america ke aay-vibhaag main, apane hi pita ke khilaaf kar-apvanchan kii rapat likhaai or apane hi bete kii gavaahi ke balboote par eldo ko apradhi ghoshit kiya gaya or use jail kii sazaa hui
 And these situations took advantage of the gossip magazines - they published news about Goochie in a way that was once Goochie's design
 1983 main, rhodolpho kii mrityu se company ko ek or jor kaa jhatka laga kyonki usne apane hisse ke 50% shares apane bete, maurizio guchi ke naam kar die the
 Maurizio, with the intention of controlling the Board of Directors, aligned with Aldo's son Paolo and established the Goochie Licensing Department in the Netherlands to succeed in his cause
 is nirnay ke baad, parivaar ke baaki sadasyon ne company chhod di or, barason main, pehali baar aisa hua ki guchi ke puure kaarobaar kii bagdor sirf ek hi vyakti ke haathon main thi
 Maurizio resorted to outside geniuses for the future of Goochie, burying the company and ruining the family
 1980 dashak ke aakhri varshon main laaye gaye parivartanon se guchi kaa naam ek baar phir vishwa ke ati prabhaavshaalee fishan-companiyon main gina jane laga, or saath hi kaarobaar atyant laabhadaayak bhi sabit hua
 In October 1995, Goochie invited the general public to partner in his company and offered his first and initial shares on AMEX and NYSE at $ 22 per share
 navambar 1997 main, guchi ne 'sevarin-montress' naam kii ghadi-utpaadan ke liye license praapt kiya jisase vah varsh kaaphi safal sabit hua
 The company later renamed the watch as 'goochie Timepieces'
 european bijnes press federation dwaara company ko uski arthniti va vitt-vyavastha, kushal nitipurna dur- drushti or utkrisht vyavasthaapan ke liye 'european company of di year' kaa khitaab bhi diya gaya
 Gucci now has offices worldwide and head offices in Florence, Milan, Paris, London, Hong Kong, Japan and New York
 jabaki PPR kaa mukhyalay paris main sthit he
 In 1989, Maurizio co-founded Don Mello - who, in 1970, resurrected the New York 'bergdorf Goodman' company and rose to prominence in the retail business - as the 'executive Vice President' and 'creative Director' of his newly formed Goochie Group Agreed to hold the post of 'worldwide'
 us vakt ‘guchi america’ kii bagdor domniko da sol - jo pehle vakaalat karte the - ke haathon main thi or jinhone, 1987 va 1989 main maurizio ko das companiyon ke adhinikaran main madad kii thi
 The company's creative team - which already included designers from Jeffrey Bean and Calvin Kline - was the last member of the young designer - Tom Ford
 texs or new mexico main paley-bade tom ford apni kishoravastha se hi fishan dizining main dilchaspee rakhte the, lekin 1986 main, 'parasns skool of dizin' se architekchar kaa course chhodane ke baad hi unhone fishan dizining ko apana kariyar banane kaa nirnay liya
 In 1990, Don Mello appointed Ford to the company at the urging of his partner, writer and editor Richard Buckley
 1990 dashak ke shuru-shuru main guchi jis daur se guzara vah company ke itihaas main sabase bura daur mana jaataa he
 This caused Maurizio to be very upset with his distributors, Investcorp shareholders and rights, and took control of the Goochie Accessories Collection - sales of more than 110 million dollars per year in the US alone
 company ke nae upsaadhan mandi se ubharne main naakaamayaab rahe or agle teen saalon tak company ko itnaa baari nuqasaan uthaanaa padaa ki company diwaaliyepan kii dahleez par ladkadaane lagi
 maurizio ke vyaktitv main ek aakarshan tha or use apane paariwarik kaarobaar se bahut lagaav bhi tha, par phir bhi chaar varshon baad company ke adhikansh varisht prabandhakon main yah sahmati hui ki vah company kaa sanchaalan karne main asamarth tha
 Because its operating system had an adverse effect on brand demand, product quality, and distribution-control
 atah use agast 1993 main majabuuran apane shares investcorp ko bechney padey
 maurizio ke jane ke ek saal ke andar hi, don melo bhi apni pichhali company bargdaurf gudman main phir laut aayin or tab creative diarector ki padavi tom ford ko mili jo us samay keval 32 varsh ke the
 Ford worked for many years under the discouraging direction of Maurizio and Mello, but now wanted to give a new direction to the company's reputation
 da sol ab guchi samooh NV - newada ke president va chif igjecutive officer ban chuke the or unhen is baat kaa ehsaas hua ki yadi guchi ko ek laabhadaayak company bananaa he to use ek nayaa rup dena hi hoga or isiliye ve ford kii doordarshita main sahyog dene ke liye raji ho gaye
 In early 1999, LVMH, a company organized to produce precious and luxurious goods operated under the hegemony of Bernard Arnault, increased its shareholding in the company with the intention of acquiring Goochie
 domniko da sol is khabar se cruddh hue or unhone, board of diarectors main ek mahatvapurn padavi kii aaranoult kii maang ko asweekrut kar diya, kyonki usase aaranoult kii pahunch company ke aay-report, niti sambandhi baithkon kii jaankaree or dizin kii pariklpanaaon sambandhi gopneey dastavejon tak batch jaati
 pratikriya main da sol ne nae shares prastut kiye taaki aaranoult kii holdings kamazor pad jaae

 kshatipurti kisi anya vyakti ke vyavhaar se jab kisi ko kuch haani pahunchati he tab usamen ek swaabhaavik pratikriya yah jaanane kii hoti he ki iskaa upachaar kya hoga? vidhi kaa yah antarnihit kartavya he ki vah haniyon kii purti kare
 There are several methods of this supply
 ek to yah ki haani uthaanewaale ko kuch mudraayen dekar kshatiputi kii jaay
 Thus, the compensation is the item from which the loss due to the duty of the defendant can be repaid by a certain amount of money given by him to the plaintiff
 is kshatipurti kii do samasyaayen hai
 The first is the extent of the plaintiff's said damages for which the defendant was held liable
 duusari yah ki pooraniy kshati kii seemaa nishchit ho jane par bhi rupayon main uskaa mulya kaise koota jaae
 Both things require a well-organized idea
 in samasyaon se sambhddha kuch aadharbhoot niyam he: The first is that 'human evil is not limited to its effects
 bahudhaa kaaryakaaran kii ek shrinkhalaa hoti he jo uske dushprinaamon kii duurastha dishaao tak chali jaati he’
 "if a ship collides with another ship, the owner of the ship will go bankrupt, later his family may also suffer from lack of education and opportunities"
 naitik sadachaar evam sunaagarikta kii drushti se to doshi ko vaadi kii ukt haani se utpann sabhi prakaar ke abhaavon ke liye uttaradaayi tehraaya janaa chahie
 We cannot reach to a certain degree the consequences of the crime committed by the defendant
 parinaamon kaa to ant nahin, kintu apekshit kartavyon kaa ek ant avashya he
 The law considers it necessary to set feasible and relevant limits of this required duty
 ‘hadlee banaam baxendal’ vaale mukademe ke niyam lagu hote he
 According to them, only those damages should be fulfilled which are either spontaneously generated or whose rational measures were thought to have led to the concealment of the consequences arising out of the breach of the amphibian while compromising
 haani vishyak vidhi main ‘green land banaam chaplin’ vaale maamle main bataaya gaya he ki prativaadee se keval unheen kshatipurtiyon kii apeksha kii ja sakati he jinaki purvakalpana koi saamanyat: budhimaan samajha janevaala vyakti kar saktaa ho
 But this criterion of futurity was called 'smith v London & South Western Railway Co
' Was not adopted in the settlement of the case
 isamen tay hua tha ki asaavadhaanee kii sthiti main doshi sabhi prakaar ke parinaamon ke liye uttaradaayi he; chaahe unhen usne pehle se soch rakhaa ho athwa nahin
 This objection ceases to have scope after inadvertence is proved that the demand for compensation is greater than expected
 yah niyam ‘in re polamis fernes vidi and kan
’ vaale maamle main sthir hua
 The defendant's servants were unloading the goods from the ship
 ek ne shateer ke ek takhte ko thokar maari or vah takhta jahaaj ke petrol -vaashp ragad khaataa neeche kii ore gaya
 Due to this action, it caught fire and this fire spread to the whole ship in some time
 jahaaj ke maalik ne puure jahaaj kii kshatipurti kaa daawa kiya
 In the defense, the defendant said that he had not imagined such a huge consequence but this tactic was not accepted
 kisi bhi kriya main asaavadhaanee siddh ho jane ke pashchaat pratwaad un sabhi parinaam kaa uttaradaayi hoga jinka sambandh sidhe taur par ukt kaary se joda ja saktaa he
 The second problem is that after determining the nature and extent of compensation, the value should be encashed in rupees
 kshatipurti kaa moolyankan likhe niyamon dwaara hota he: The first is that the method of settlement agreement has the basic purpose of indemnification - bringing the loss-making party to the appropriate position to reach the point where the agreement is reached in the event of breach of agreement
 yon kshatipurti vaadi dwaara jhele janevaale nuksaan ko bharne ke liye hi hoti he, na ki us ulanghankarta ko sajaa dene ke liye
 In the law of law, the rule is also the same supply, but in the case of damage done, the result of compensation can be increased or reduced
 jahaan kshati jaan boojhkar athwa dweshvash pahanchaai jaati he vahaan nyaayalay vaadi kii kshati kii aapurti yathochit dhan se bhi adhik dekar kar saktaa he
 This type of compensation is considered ideal or punitive
 dandatmak kshatiputiyon kaa uddeshy ek ore to prativaadee ko dand dena he, duusari ore abhavagrast vaadi ko anupranit karnaa bhi he
 Where the damage has been inflicted inadvertently or the plaintiff is fit to pay such a fine, he is asked to compensate with a very small amount
 ye manbhanjak kshatipurtiyan maani gai he
 They reveal the court's disinterest against the plaintiff's work
 doosraa yah ki chunki pratigyanabaddh samjhaute or vikshati donon hi maamalon main antarnihit uddeshy abhaavphurti kaa hi hota he ek yah niyam apane aaj ni:sruth hota he ki yadi vaadi ne haani nahin uthaai he to vah kisi kshatipurti kaa bhi daavedaar nahin he
 But in case of violation of the legitimate rights of the plaintiff, the court can compensate him for a small amount
 ye namna kshatipurtiyan hai jo vastut: rakam kahin jane yogya to hoti hai kintu pariman kii drushti se unka koi khaas astitv nahin hota
 The case of 'ashby v White' is an example of this
 vaadi sansadeey chunaav main matadaata tha
 The Election Officer prevented him from casting his vote
 vaadi ne usapar apane vaid adhikaar ke hanan kaa daawa kiya
 The defendant submitted an argument in defense that the plaintiff did not suffer any financial loss from him
 kintu nyaayalay ne kaha har haani apni kshatipurti leti hi he, bhalen hi us paksh kii ek kaudi bhi haani na hui ho
 Compensation is not just punitive
 haani apni kshatipurti us dasha main bhi leti he jab kisi adhikarashetra main koi baadha hoti he
 For example, the words uttered in the wrong propaganda do not cause any economic loss to anyone, at least, the words that are uttered but can be acted upon
 kisi vyakti ne yadi kisi anya kii canapati par ek mukka maaraa to isse peedit vyakti kaa kuch bhi vyay nahin hua, kintu etdarth usapar karrwai ho sakati he
 Taking a ride on another's land can be considered as an attack on his property without loss
 teesraa yah ki samjhaute evam vikshati, donon hi maamalon main vaadi kaa karttavya kshati kaa shaman karne ke liye aavashyak kadam uthaanaa ho jaataa he
 For example, if the defendant breaches the agreement and refuses to load the goods of the plaintiff on his ship, it is the duty of the plaintiff to ship the goods on another vessel, if available
 yadi usne isamen asaavadhaanee dikhalaai or aksmaat tufaan aa jane se dockyard main padaa padaa saamaan nasht ho gaya to prativaadee is haani ke liye uttaradaayi nahin
 Similarly, the refusal of a crew to deliver a material ship is the duty of the shipowner to use any other accessible vessel to mitigate the damage
 is siddhant kaa vishleshan jamaal banaam mullah, daaud aid kan
 vaale maamle main hua he
 According to an agreement, it was decided to sell 23,500 shares and to be sent and paid by 30 December 1911
 share aamantrit kiye gaye lekin prativaadee ne unki delivery lene athwa paise chukaane se haath khinch liya
 Now in such cases the difference between the agreement and the market prices will be the basis of its fulfillment
 samjhauta bhang vaale din shaiyaron par samjhautevaale mulya se 1,09,218 ru
 kam milanaa chahie tha
 But there was no sale till 28 February 1912
 is samay bazaar dar bad rahi thi at: sheyaron par, samjhautevaale daam se keval 79,862 ru
 kam mili
 The respondent urged that we should pay only Rs 79,862
 Be held accountable only kintu nishchit hua ki aisi kshatipurtiyon kii maap, samjhautabhang honevaale din kii bazaar dar or samjhaute kii dar ke bich kaa nihit antar hona chahie
 Here the seller can take full amount for his compensation
 yadi vikreta samjhauta-bhang hone ke baad bhi un anshon ko rakhata he to vah khareednevaale se, bazaar dar gir jane kii avasthaa main, to kisi prakaar kii atirikt kshatipurti paane kaa adhikari hoga or na bazaar dar bad jane kii avasthaa main kshatipurti kii rakam gata hi sakegaa
 The compensation payable by the defendant is primarily assessed by the court
 moolyankan nyaayalay ke vichaardhin hone kii avasthaa main kii gai karrwai ‘agruhit kshatipurti’ ke liye hui kehalaati he
 But sometimes the parties to these agreements demand the amount of compensation from the persons who breached the agreement
 yadi us tay kii hui rakam kaa anumaan sambhavit haani ke bilkul baraabar hona thik maan liya gaya to vah adaa kii gai kshatipurti samajhi jaaegi or puri rakam hi doshi paksh ko deni hogi
 But if it is not deemed equal to the potential loss, but it is believed that the settlement is fixed for punishing the scribe or for excessive payment of such mistake, it will be treated as a fine
 nyaayalay isse asahmati rakhata he or keval unhi kshatipurtiyon ko anumati detaa he jo vaadi kii vaastavik haani ko puri karte hon

 ampear, laghu rup main amp, vidyut dhara, yaa vidyut aavesh kii maatra prati sacond; kii ikai he
 Ampere SI is the basic unit and is named after andre-marie Ampere, a scientist who discovered electromagnetism
 ampear vah sthir dhara he, jise yadi do aseemit lambaai ke samanaantar chaalkon main rakhaa jaye, jinka naganya anuprastha kshetrafal ho or nirvaat main ek meter kii duuri par sthit hon; to in chaalkon main 2×10–7 newton prati meter kaa bal utpann kare
 The ampere SI is the basic unit, such as meter, calvin, second, mole, candela, and kilogram
 isko vidyut aavesh kii matra ke sandarbh ke bina hi paribhaashahit kiya gaya he
 The unit of charge is the derived unit of coulomb
 isaki paribhaasha anusaar, vah awesh kii maatra, jo ki ek ampear dhara dwaara ek sacond main visthapit kiya gaya ho
 Consequently, electric current is the rate of displacement of electric charge

 Acharya Bharata has called Natya in the first chapter of Natyasastra to be a simulation of the vast expressions of the three worlds and has described it as the universal Veda
 bharat ke anusaar aisa koi gyaan shilp, vidya, yoga evam karm nahin he jo naatak main dikhaai na pade - The development of Sanskrit Natya literature started from the Vedic period respectively
 is sandarbh main pro
 indrapal singh ‘‘indra’’ kaa kathan ullekhneey he - vedon main aise sanket avashya milte hai jinase vedikakaal main natkon kii sthiti siddh hoti he
 In the Rigveda hymns, acting during somvikrai is revealed
 mahavrath strot ke avasar par kumariyaan nrity gaan ke saath agni kii parikrama karti thi
 Shukla Yajurveda's Vajasaneya Samhita contains the word "shailush" in the sixth verse of the thirty-third chapter, which means - actor
 kaha jaataa he ki ek soot ko nrity ke liye or shailush ko gane ke liye niyukt kiya janaa chaiye
 The sources of the Samaveda are ragas, which suggests that music was in full development in the Vedic era
 sangeet ke alaava nrity tathaa vaadya ke bhi sanket praapt hote hai
 This proves that in the Vedic era all those products were found in abundance which are required for the development of drama
 vedon ke pashchaat ramayana evam mahabharat main bhi naatak ke sanket praapt hote hai
 In the Mahabharata, the names of "ramayana drama" and "kaubera Rangabhisar" have been named
 mahabharat ke viraat parv main rangashaala tathaa nat kaa prayog he
 In the Ramayana, "nut", "drama", "rang" and dancer are mentioned in many places

 Therefore, at this time also, the theater became India-wide
 patanjali ne ‘‘mahabhashya’’ main ‘‘kansavadh’’ tathaa ‘‘balivadh’’ do naatakon kaa namollekh kiya he
 The term "rasiko Natah" in the Mahabhashya proves that at the time of Patanjali he had full knowledge of the Ras Siddhanta
 ukt vivaran se siddh hota he ki naatakon kii utpatti bharat main hui tathaa vah vaidic kaal se hi kramshah viksit hota hua apane unnat swaroop ko praapt hua
 Among the metaphors currently available, the playwright is the most ancient of the metaphors - a majority of such scholars
 duusare shabdon main ham kah sakate he ki bhaas sanskrit natya sahitya ke aadya naatakkaar hai
 On studying the major plays of Sanskrit literature, the following major characteristics are seen in them - 1
 sanskrit naatakon main vastu, netaa evam ras in tatwon ko pramukh sthaan diya gaya he
 The metaphors have been divided on the basis of these elements - "object leader Rasasteshan Bhudek"
 ’’ roopak ke das bhed hai jinamein naatak pratham bhed he
 2
 As far as the narrative is concerned, the plot of most plays is historical and mythological
 ramayana evam mahabharat kii kathavstu ko aadhaar banaakar adhikansh naatak likhe gayi hai
 3
 As far as the leader or the characters are concerned, the characters are kept according to the narrative
 kuch naatak aise bhi hai, jinamein samaaj ke sabhi virgon kaa pratinidhitiv he, jaise shudrakavirchit ‘‘mrichctic’’
 4
 Among the above three elements, rasa has been given the highest priority
 sanskrit naatakakaron dwaara kathavstu kii yatharthata kii ore utana dhyaan nahin diya gaya he jitna prekshkon athwa pathakon ke hriday main kisi ras vishesh kaa sanchaar karne kii ore
 The criterion of the success of the poet is considered to be positive
 ras ko hi natyakala kaa pradhan lakshya mana gaya
 One of the sringar or veer rasa is considered as the principal rasa in these plays, the rest are used as auxiliary juices

 naatyashastreey niyamanusaar adhikansh sanskrit naatakon kaa nandi paath prastaavna aadi se prarambh kiya gaya he tathaa ‘‘bharatvakya’’ se samaapti kii gai he
 6
 These major Sanskrit plays range from 5 to 7 digits
 adhikansh naatak 6 va 7 ankon ke hai
 7
 In Sanskrit plays, the language is used according to the characters
 uttam koti ke paatr sanskrit kaa prayog karte hai tathaa anya paatr praakrit bhashaa kaa prayog karte hai
 8
 The hallmark of Sanskrit plays is actority
 inaki samvaad yojana atyant aakarshak he
 But the discovery of the time and place specified by Aristotle is often lacking in these plays, because in many Sanskrit plays, the poetic aspect has become strong
 9
 adhikansh sanskrit naatak sukhaant likhe gayi hai
 But this statement is not reasonable in Sanskrit, there is an absolute lack of sad plays
 yadi duhkhant naatak kaa arth nayak ke shok, paraabhav or mrityu kaa chithran karnaa he to is drushti se ‘‘karnabhaar’’, ‘‘urubhang’’, venisanhaar or chandkowshik nishchit rup se duhkhant naatak maane jane chaiye
 10
 Apart from the hero and heroine, the clown also has an important role in Sanskrit plays
 11
 sanskrit naatakon main prakruti ke saath ghanishtha sambandh drushtigat hota he
 The inner nature and external nature have been beautifully coordinated in these plays
 antah prakruti kii sookshm evam sukumaar bhaawanaaon ke chithran ke liye bahya prakruti chitrafalak kaa kaary karti he
 Humanization of nature has also been a specialty of Sanskrit metaphors
 inamen maanav kaa prakruti ke saath ghanishtha sambandh drushtigochar hota he
 At the time of Shakuntala's departure in Kalidasa's "abhigyan Shakuntalam", a lively description of the condition of natural products is a heart-warming feeling - isi prakaar bhawabhootivirachit ‘‘uttarramcharita’’ naatak kaa ek romantic varnan drushtavy he - These types of narratives are virtually unique examples of humanization of nature in Sanskrit theater
 12
 sanskrit naatakon main bhavatatv kii pradhanta he
 Sanskrit playwright's most efforts are seen in the subtle marking of emotions and incorporating poetic beauty in them
 yahi kaaran he ki sanskrit naatakon ke abhinay main utani saralata nahin drushtigat hoti, jitani paashchaatya naatakon main sahaj sambhav hoti he
 The Sanskrit playwright, being the poet's heart, considers emotions to be the father of gambhirya, he does not give importance to blank artistry
 13
 sanskrit rupakon main kathanak bhi kavyashilp ke anuroop chalata he
 The plan of five economies, functions and treaties is in the basic subsistence of narrative fluency
 abhinay kii sthiti vishesh ke rup main bharti, saatvati kaishiki evam arbhati main se koi ek vritti apanaayi jaati he
 14
 Effectiveness is the main feature of Sanskrit plays
 prabhavotpaadakta kaa mul kaaran yah he ki sanskrit naatakon main naatakkaar bhootkaaleen ghatana ke abhinay ko is prakaar prastut karata he, maanon vah pathakon athwa prakshekon ko uskaa pratyaksh abhas kara rahaa ho
 This presentation makes the play feel more effective than the epic or novel, as it is the sensation of the interaction of the readers with the event
 15
 sanskrit naatakon kii rachana ke mul main pramukh uddeshya duhkhi, thake huye evam shok se trast logon kaa manoranjan karnaa rahaa he jaisaa ki naatyashaastra ke pratham adhyay main bharatmuni ne likhaa haih- Kalidas, the great Sanskrit playwright, in his play 'malavikagnimitra', has mentioned very beautiful dance-acting
 vah chitra apane main itnaa prabhaavshaalee, romantic or saras he ki samooche pracheen sahitya main apratim mana jaataa he
 In the drama 'malavikagnimitra', the two dancers quarrel about their mastery of the art and it is certain that both show the dancing and acting of their disciples and the ungodly Bhagwati Kaushiki will decide who is the best of both
 Both acharyas got ready
 mrudang baj uthaa
 Audiences sat in place in the auditorium
 bhikshuni kii anumati se rani kii paricharika malvika ke shikshak acharya gandaas yavanika ke interval se susajjita shishyaa ko rangabhumi main le aaye
 It had already become stable that the acting with Chhilik dance — in which the actor ventures into the role of another to express his own mood — would be shown
 malvika ne gaan shuru kiya
 The point was that the love of a beloved lover towards a rare person is once filled with anguish and then becomes elated with hope, after many days, after seeing the beloved one, he has laid eyes on him
 bhav malvika ke sidhe hriday se nikle the, kanth uskaa karun tha
 The king and observers are being chanted by his incomparable beauty, acting, vocal chords, dancing pleasure, and the melodious music of the gorge
 abhinay ke baad hi jab malvika parade kii ore jane lagi, to vidooshak ne kisi bahaane use roka
 She stood tightly, her left hand was configured on the wrist, her kinkel was wrung on the wrist, the right hand swinged loosely like blackness, the bowed vision stood on the feet, where the toe of the flowers lay on the floor
 The children were slowly moving and the lowliness of the dance was blissful
 malvika usee prakaar khadi hui thi, jis saushthav ke saath dehvinyas karke usko rangabhumi main khadaa hona uchit tha
 Parivrajika Kaushiki plays her Dad-acting is absolutely flawless
 bina bole bhi abhinay kaa bhav spasht hi prakashit hua he, angavikshep bahut sundar or chaaturipurn hua he
 In the juice that has been acted, in that juice, there is a clear goal
 bhavacheshtaa sajiv hokar spasht hui he, malvika ne balpurvak anya vishyon se hamaare chitt ko abhinay kii ore khinch liya he
 Kalidas has presented the living model of Indian culture, art, beauty and acting in this verse
 vaise bhi kalidas rangamanch ko ‘chakshush yajna’ kehete hai
 His verse is an example of this, that the aesthetics of Sanskrit drama is derived from Indian culture and traditions and is associated with contemplation, joy, aesthetic perception
 sanskrit main hameshaa achche natyaprayog par bal diya gaya he
 As much as 'play elements' were considered necessary in good drama, so was its refinement and auspicious, auspicious form
 lekin kahin bhi vah lok se alag nahin he, lok kaa bhavanukirthan he, jivan ke vibhinn bhaavon, kriya-vyapaaron ke saath naatak hamen samrasya kii ore le jaataa he isiilie hamaara sanskrit naatak jivan ke ullas kaa, anand kaa pratik he, pashchim kii tarah anukaran or tragedy kaa nahin
 Sanskrit drama and theater have therefore evolved from both folkloric and theatrical traditions
 lok vyavhaar or maanav swabhaav ko hi pramaan maanate hue sanskrit naatak parishkrut buddhi, samrudh kalpana or kalaatmakataa kaa prayog karata he
 He represents a certain philosophy and culture
 bhartiya naatak or rangamanch ke devtaa nataraj shiv swayan samrasya or mangalya ke, kalyaan ke pratik hai
 Drama and theater originated in us as religious acts, religious rituals
 isliye uskaa swarup anusthanparak he
 There is a complete legislation in the whole process of puvarang - from pratyahar to praroka, etc
 Indradhwaja is all religious and ritualistic
 The creation of this ritualistic environment is done on the basis of many dramatics and dharmatas
 naatyashaastra main bharatmuni ne isiilie kaha he ki yah natya to ‘panchmaved’ he jisamen kahin dharm he, kahin krida, kahin arth, kahin shaanti


fih natya-ras, bhav, karm tathaa kriyaaon ke abhinay dwaara lok main sabko upadesh dene vaala he
 


 in fact it also expresses the social side of Sanskrit drama
 hamaara mul swar sangharsh kaa na hokar, fal kaa, anand kaa he
 Beginning with the play's plot, storytelling, systematics and efforts, the attainment proceeds through destiny and leads to the flourishing
 isiilie sanskrit naatak main bhagya kaa nahin karm kaa mahatva he or karm karne vaala nayak dhirodatt nayak he jisamen lakshya-prapti ke sabhi bhartiya gun maujuud hai
 Rasa is the basis of the entire drama and theater
 ‘ten ras evam natyam rasanubhuti hi natya kaa falak he isiilie hamaare yahan naanaa rason santachari bhaavon, sthaayee bhaavon kii yojana kii gayi he or ‘rasnishpatti’ evam saadhaaraneekaran ko mahatva diya gaya he
 The episodes of 'asura debacle', 'amrit Manthan', 'tripurdah' plays also show that the play was linked to life
 or bharat muni ke samay main hi naatak ke vividh avyav nishchit ho chuke the- nat, nati, nrity-vaadya, sangeet samvaad kathavstu rangamanch
 In 'malavikagnimitra', Kalidas has also clearly stated the face of Natyacharya Ganadas
 naatyan bhinnruperjansy bahudhatyekan samaaradhanam’
 Drama is composed on the basis of the difference of interest of human beings, drama has been considered as an art which every category of people can see without any discrimination
 devdatt shastri ne kaha bhi he ki ‘sambhavtah varg sangharsh ko mitaane kaa yah sarvapratham praytn naatak ke madhyam se kiya gaya tha
 ' sanskrit naatak jis vaividhya, anand or parishkar kii ore le jaataa he usamen sangeet kii bahut badi bhoomika he
 Utsavadharma, the rituals of various ragas, the festivals, the timing and the emotions, the juxtaposition of the juices run as the playwrights, the rhythm, the rhythm, the dance, the instrumental music, the classical legislation of the song creates a complete aesthetic which is very rich and serious, meaningful, creative
 is
 ‘swapnvasavadatta’ kaa udayan or ‘mrichhakaticam’ charudutt to swayan sangeetkaar hai
 Mangalacharan, singing, nandipath by sutradhar, nat-nati etc
 creates such a beauty and before that creates such an environment in the Poorvarang Vidhan Rangala, prepares the mind of the observer that we reach a different world
 yah sangeet or vidhaan prekshak ko aakrisht hi nahin karata, naatak ke vishay se sambandhit vaataavaran kii ore bhi le jaataa he
 Tension, immersion changes the whole psyche
 ‘venisanhaar’ naatak main sangeet armbh karne ke liye sutaradhar kii ajna hone par pariparshivak poochta he- ‘katmam samaymayitv giyatam’ arthath kisi ritu ke aadhaar par gaaya jaae ? ye sabhi prayog ritu, samay, sangeet ke aantarik sambandh ko bhi vyakt karte hai or ‘natyaprayog’ main yah swatantrata bhi dete hai ki sutaradhar aavashyaktaanusaar usamen parivartan bhi kar sake
 It is also special that dance and playing are more used in Sanskrit drama, less of songs
 kahin-kahin rachanaakaar us kaal ke prachlit mahatvapurn sangeet paksh kaa sanket bhi detaa he jaise ‘mrichhakaticam’ main nayak charudutt ke liye ‘gandharv shrotu gatsya’ kaa prayog shudrak ne kiya he jisase gandharv sangeet ke prachlan kaa abhas hota he
 Lokaranjan, Kavyanand Atmanand have been an integral part of Sanskrit drama
 jaahir he is anand tak pahunchne ke liye prekshak bhi vishisht ruchi-sampann, sanskarayukt apekshit tha
 Keith then says that 'uncivilized, foolish, atheistic and lower class could not enter the observatories
 ’ ve darshak ras-shaastra ke niyamon ke gyaata, nrity or sangeet abhinay se parichit hote the
 It is clearly stated in the Natyasastra that all the senses of the observer must be corrected, in the guise he should be strong - knowing the guilt and the ragi
 use samvedansheel, sahruday hona chahie
 He should be virtuous, penetrating arts, crafts, so that he can fully experience the complex, complex art like drama
 prekshak kaa sidhaa pratyaksh sambandh abhinayta se hota he
 In our Indian drama tradition, the importance of the actor, not the director - is the basis of all expression, the main medium is why our drama has such a detailed and serious description of the actor, his personality, qualities, actions
 abhinayta kaa sharir uski vaani, gati, haav-bhav, kriya-vyapaar sab naye arth dete hai isiilie angik, vaachik, aharya, satvik prakaaron ke saath-saath aankh, sir, haath, pair, aadi kii itani mudraayen bataayi gayi hai-vibhinn ang-upang, mudraayen, angahaar, karan, chaari aadi kaa vistrut nirupan hua he ki uskaa vaastavik prashikshan sahi maanon main abhinayta ko ‘rachataa’ he or bina bahya upkarnon ke srijan kii kalpanaaon ko saakaar karata he
 It is a wonderful store of acting which is being used in Bharatanatyam dance but not so much in theater
 abhinay kaa puraa shaastra sanskrit naatakon kaa aadhaar he
 He calls for a systematic practice, cultivation, faith, and expertise, as is required in music houses, in classical art
 yadhyapi sanskrit naatak rajaprasaadon or mandiron main hote the par us samay ke sthapaty sambandhi shaastra or natya mandapon kaa bhi ullekh miltaa he
 The pavilions were erected in large temples or at other places
 naatyashaastra main shailaguhaakaar kaa ullekh he
 Bharata has described three types of theatrical pavilions - Vikritish Chatursara, Triasra
 inke bhi bhed bataae gayi hai
 The arrangement of Rangpeeth, Rangshirsha, Naphtya, Mattavarini, Yavanika Tirusardini, etc
 on the stage expresses a complete presentation hypothesis, aesthetic sense
 vastutah sanskrit manch anumanashrith tha, satyabhaas virdohi tha
 Whether it is visualization or any visual work, visualization - garden, flower vines, ocean, water, storm, storm etc
, or chariot, the bird is imagined
 ‘abhigyanshakuntalam’ main rath kii teevr gati, mrug kaa daudna, dushyant kaa swargavataran aadi ke drishy abhinayta hi apni mudraon or gatiyon se anumaanit karaata he
 This is indicative legislation of theatrical methods which are human and not mechanical and miraculous
 praayah sanskrit naatakon main parvat, vimaan, andhkaar, suryoday, akhet aadi ke drishy chitrabhinay dwaara kiye jate hai
 Kalidas, in the plays of Bhavabhuti Shudraka, directs the scenes of Varsha, Ka cloud-roaring, Chandrodaya deer cubs, apes, summers and Autumn lions snakes etc
 akashabhashit janantik, apvaarit natyarudhiyaan bhi abhinay-kaushal kaa or sanskrit naatak rangamanch ko prakruti kaa abhas karti he
 Sanskrit theater is basically poetic theater, so it has the characteristic of bhavanukirtan, bhavdharma
 yah kavy samgr rachana se, abhinay sey sangeet se, bhashaa se srujit hota he
 The play enlightens the observer's emotions and makes them tasteful
 ras nishpatti sambandhi sari drushti natya par hi aadhaarit he
 The Sanskrit platform was never forgotten by the observer
 use santusht karnaa hi naatakeey siddhi maani gayi
 The presentation of 'abhigyanasakuntalam,' Malavikagnimitra 'and' Malatimadhav 'clearly states that his scholarship was presented to the Council
 isse sanskrit main natyaprayog ke mahatva or natyaprayog or prekshak ke gahan kaa sambandh kaa pataa chalata he
 No such personal aesthetics could be created in Hindi
 ek rachanaatmak prayaas bharatendu or prasad ne kiya tha lekin vah unheen tak simit rah gaya
 Both the playwrights were exploring the nature of Hindi drama and theater based on Indian folk drama and western drama based on their folk and theatrical traditions, which remained confined to them

 The national flag of India, also known as the tricolor, is a flag embellished by a circle of blue between three horizontal stripes of color
 isaki abhiklpana pingali vankaiya ne kii thi
 It was adopted on 15 August 1947, in a meeting of the Indian Constituent Assembly held on 22 July 1947, just a few days before India's independence from the British
 isamen teen samaan chaudaai kii kshaitij pattiyaan hai, jinamein sabase upar kesaria, bich main shwet ore neeche gahare hare rang kii pattee he
 The ratio of the length and width of the flag is 3: 2
 safed pattee ke madhya main gahare nile rang kaa ek chakra he jisamen 24 aare hote hai
 The diameter of this chakra is approximately equal to the width of the white band and the form is similar to that seen in the circle of the lion head of the Ashoka Pillar at Sarnath

 For the first time in 1951, the Bureau of Indian Standards laid down certain rules for the national flag
 1968 main tirangaa nirmaan ke maanak tay kiye gaye
 These rules are very stringent
 keval khaadi yaa haath se kata gaya kapadaa hi jhanda banane ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 From the weaving of the cloth to the making of the flag, it is tested many times
 jhanda banane ke liye do tarah kii khaadi kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 One is the khadi that makes cloth and the other is khadi-tat
 khaadi ke keval kapaas, resham or oon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Even its weaving is different from normal weaving
 ye bunai behad durlabh hoti he
 It is only known by less than a dozen people from across the country

 These were revised in 1964, which were in line with the metric system in India
 in nirdeshon ko aage chalakar 17 agast 1968 main sanshodhit kiya gaya
 These guidelines are extremely stringent and any defect in the manufacture of the flag is considered a serious offense, for which fines or jail or both may be punishable
 beuro of indian standard dwaara rashtradhvaj ko taiyaar karne ke teen dastavej jari kiye gaye hai
 It says that all the flags will be of Khadi silk or cotton
 jhande banane kaa maanak 1968 main tay kiya gaya jise 2008 main pun: sanshodhit kiya gaya
 Nine standard sizes have been fixed for the tricolor
 sabase bada jhanda 21 feet lanbaa or 14 feet chaudaa hota he
 Firstly, in Khadi Gramodyog Samyukta Sangh of Bagalkot district, about 550 km from Bengaluru, the fabric is spun and woven very carefully
 iske baad kapade ko teen alag-alag lot banaae jate hai
 These are dyed in three different colors of the tricolor
 daai kiye hue kapade bangaloru se 420 kimi sthit hubli ikai main bhej die jate hai
 Here they are cut according to the different sizes

 Only Khadi or hand-cut cloth is considered suitable for the flag
 khaadi ke liye kaccha maal keval kapaas, resham or oon hai
 Two types of khadi are used to make the flag, one is the khadi from which the cloth is made and the other is khadi-tat, which is beige colored and is worn in a pillar
 khaadi taat ek asaamaanya prakaar kii bunai he jisamen teen dhaagon ke jaal jaise banate hai
 This is different from traditional weaving, where two threads are woven
 is prakaar kii bunai atyant durlabh he, is kaushal ko banaae rakhane vaale bunakar bharat main ek darjan se bhi kam hai
 It is also mentioned in the guidelines that there should be 150 formulas per square centimeter, with the same weight of 205 threads per four formulas and one square foot in cloth
 is buni khaadi ko do ikaayiyon se praapt kiya jaataa he, dharwar ke nikat gadag se or uttari karnataka ke bagalkot jilon se
 At present, the Karnataka Khadi Gramodyog Samyukta Union, based in Hubli, is the only licensed one that produces and supplies the flag
 yadhyapi bharat main jhanda vinirmaan ikaayiyon kii sthapana kii anumati khaadi vikaas or gramin udyog ayog dwaara diya jaataa he parantu yadi disha-nirdeshon kii avagya kii gayi to biies ko inhen radd karne ke saare adhikaar praapt hai

 Around 40 million flags are sold annually in India
 bharat main sabase bada jhanda rajya prashasnic mukhyalay, maharashtra ke mantralay bhawan se fahraaya jaataa he
 The Indian Flag Code was amended on 26 January 2002 and many years after independence, the citizens of India were allowed to fly in their homes, offices and factories etc
 not only on national days, but on any day without interruption
 ab bhartiya naagarik rashtriya jhande ko kahin bhi or kisi bhi samay fahraa sakate he, basharte ki ve dhvaj kii samhita kaa kadai se paalan karen or tirange ke sammaan main koi kami na aane den
 For the convenience, the Indian Flag Code, 2002 is divided into three parts
 samhita ke pehle bhaag main rashtriya dhvaj kaa saamaanya vivaran he
 The second part of the Code talks about the display of the national flag by members of the public, private organizations, educational institutions, etc
 samhita kaa teesraa bhaag kendriya or rajya sarkaron tathaa unke sanghathanon or abhikaranon dwaara rashtriya dhvaj ke pradarshan ke vishay main jaankaree detaa he
 There are some rules and regulations based on the 26 January 2002 legislation on how to hoist the flag: adhik jaankaree bhartiya dhvaj samhita main dekhi ja sakati he
 The Indian National Flag represents the hopes and aspirations of the citizens of India
 yah desh ke rashtriya gaurav kaa pratik he
 Before 2002, the general public of India could not hoist the national flag in public except for a few national festivals
 ek udyogpati, naveen jindal ne, dilli ucch nyaayalay main, is pratibandh ko hataane ke liye janhit main ek yachika daayar kii
 Jindal deliberately hoisted the flag at his office building in violation of the flag code
 dhvaj ko jabt kar liya gaya or un par mukadmaa chalaane kii chetavanee di gai
 Jindal argued that as a citizen it is his right to hoist the flag with dignity and respect and it is a way of expressing his love for India
 tadoparaant kendriya mantrimandal ne, bhartiya jhanda samhita main 26 janvari 2002, ko sanshodhan kiye jisamen aam janata ko varsh ke sabhi dinon jhanda fahraane kii anumati di gayi or dhvaj kii garima, sammaan kii raksha karne ko kaha gaya
 In the case of V
 Yashwant Sharma in the Indian Union, it was said that this flag code is not a law, the restrictions of the code have to be followed and the honor of the national flag has to be maintained
 rashtriya dhvaj ko fahraana ek purna adhikaar nahin he, par is kaa paalan samvidhan ke anuchhed 51-e ke anusaar karnaa hoga
 According to Indian law, the flag should always be viewed with 'dignity, loyalty and respect'
 "bharat kii jhanda samhita-2002", ne pratikon or naamon ke adhinium, 1950" kaa atikaraman kiya or ab vah dhvaj pradarshan or upyog kaa niyantran karata he
 Government regulations state that the flag should never be touched with land or water
 us kaa prayog mezposh ke rup main, yaa manch par nahin dhakaa ja saktaa, isse kisi murti ko dhakaa nahin ja saktaa na hi kisi aadharshila par daalaa ja saktaa tha
 Until 2005, it could not be used as a dress or as a uniform
 par 5 july 2005, ko bharat sarkaar ne samhita main sanshodhan kiya or dhvaj ko ek poshaak ke rup main yaa vardi ke rup main prayog kiye jane kii anumati di
 However, it cannot be used as a fabric below the waist or as a thigh
 rashtriya dhvaj ko takiye ke rup main yaa roomaal ke rup main karne par nishedh he
 Flags cannot be intentionally upside down, kept, immersed in anything, or objects other than flower petals
 kisi prakaar kaa sarnama jhande par ankit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Several traditional rules of handling and displaying flags should be followed
 yadi khule main jhanda fahraaya ja rahaa he to hameshaa suryoday par fahraaya janaa chahie or suryaast par utaar dena chahie chaahe mausam kii sthiti kisi bhi ho
 In 'certain circumstances' the flag can be hoisted at night at a government building
 jhande kaa chithran, pradarshan, ulta nahin ho saktaa naa hi ise ulta fahraaya ja saktaa he
 It is also stated in the Samhita tradition that it cannot be hung vertically
 jhande ko 90 ansh main ghumaya nahin ja saktaa yaa ulta nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Any person can read the flag like a book from top to bottom and left to right, if it is rotated, the result should be the same
