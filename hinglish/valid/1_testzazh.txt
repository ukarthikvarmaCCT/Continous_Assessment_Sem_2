 After that Guru Gobind Ji took an iron bowl and mixed it with water and sugar and mixed it with a double-edged sword and gave it the name of Amrit
 pehle 5 khalsa ke banane ke baad unhen chhathvaan khalsa kaa naam diya gaya jiske baad unka naam guru gobind raay se guru gobind singh rakh diya gaya

 idhar 27 disambar san 1704 ko donon chote sahibajaade or jorawatsingh va fatehsinghji ko deevaaron main chunavaa diya gaya
 When Guruji came to know about this, he wrote a Zafarnama to Aurangzeb, in which he warned Aurangzeb that the Khalsa Panth was ready to destroy your empire
 8 may san 1705 main 'muktsar' naamak sthaan par mughalon se bhayanak yuddh hua, jisamen guruji kii jeet hui
 In October 1706, Guruji went to the south where you came to know the death of Aurangzeb
 aurangzeb ne marate samay ek shikaayat patr likhaa tha
 Surprisingly, the one who had looted everything, he was writing the Fathnama and the one who had everything is writing a spurious Naama
 iskaa kaaran tha sachai
 Guruji always waged war against tyranny and not for his personal gain
 aurangzeb kii mrityu ke baad aapane bahadurshah ko badshaah banane main madad kii
 The relationship between Guruji and Bahadur Shah was very good
 in sambandhon ko dekhakar sarhad kaa nawab vajit khan ghabara gaya

 About Guru Govindji Lala Daulatarai, a staunch Arya Samaji, writes, 'I could have written a lot about Swami Vivekananda, Swami Dayanand, Paramahamsa etc
, but i cannot write about them which are full men
 Are not
 mujhe purna purush ke sabhi gun guru govindsingh main milte hai
 'therefore Lala Daulatrai has written a good book about Guru Govind Singhji called Purna Purush
 isi prakaar mohammad abdul latif bhi likhata he ki jab main guru govindsinghji ke vyaktitv ke bare main sochataa hoon to mujhe samaj main nahin aata ki unke kis pahalu kaa varnan karuun
 Sometimes he looks at me as a Mahadhiraja, sometimes a Mahadani, sometimes a Fakir, sometimes he is a Guru

 He is the third son of the famous Tamil Nadu politician Karunanidhi and his second wife Smt Dayalu Ammal
 unka naam joseph stallin ke naam par rakhaa gaya tha jinaki mrityu unke janm ke varsh main hi hui thi
 Stalin completed his graduation in history from Nandanam Arts College, Madras University in Chennai
 stallin 2006 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke baad tamilnadu sarkaar main gramin vikaas or sthaneey prashasan mantri bane
 On 29 May 2009, Stalin was nominated as Deputy Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu by Governor Surjit Singh Barnala
 unke bade bhai emke ajhagiri rasayan or urvarak mantri hai
 Her half-sister Kanimozhi is a Rajya Sabha member
 stallin diemke ke koshadhyaksh or yuva morcha ke adhyaksh ke rup main bhi karyrat hai
 Stalin was born in Madras, now known as Chennai
 unka raajnneetik kariyar 14 varsh kii aayu main 1967 ke chunaavon main prachaar ke saath shuru hua tha
 In 1973, Stalin was elected to the General Committee of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam
 ve us samay surkhiyon main aae jab unhen apatkaal kaa virodh karne ke liye aantarik suraksha rakrakhaav adhinium ke tahat jail main band kar diya gaya tha
 Stalin has been elected to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly four times since 1989 from the Thousand Lights constituency in Chennai
 stallin 1996 main is shahar ke pehle sidhe taur par nirvaachit meyar bane the
 In 2001, Stalin was re-elected mayor, although the Tamil Nadu Municipal Law Act, 2002 was enacted by the then Chief Minister j Jayalalithaa
 yah ek aisa kaanoon he jo ek vyakti ko sarkaar main do nirvaachit pad rakhane se roktaa he
 The statute was retroactively applied to Stalin's case which was widely seen as a move aimed at removing him from the post of Mayor of Chennai
 haalaanki madras ucch nyaayalay ne is kaanoon ko yah kehete hue aprabhavi qaraar diya tha ki vaidhanik nikaayon ko purvyaapee rup se logon ke "moulik adhikaron" ko prabhavit karne vaale kanoon banane se "roka" nahin gaya tha
 The court, however, held that under the Madras City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919, a person cannot be the Mayor for two consecutive terms although unlike Stalin, the earlier Mayor was not directly elected
 stallin ne sarvocch nyaayalay main apil nahin kii
 Since his first arrest in 1975, Stalin has been arrested several times on various public issues under the MISA, which is very close to the Terrorism and Hooligan Act, and has been given severe corporal punishment in the past
 karunanidhi ko aadhi raat ko giraftaar kiya janaa jisamen karunanidhi, stallin, maaraan or anya logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya or un par fliover ghotaale kaa aarope lagaaya gaya tha
 It was widely seen as a move to political vendetta as a complaint was lodged in the FIR or police on Friday night and the arrests were made on Saturday morning just hours after it
 haalaanki yah giraftaar 2001 main hui thi, adaalat main aarope patr chaar saal baad 2005 main daayar kiya gaya tha
 In Tamil Nadu, Stalin played an important role in campaigning in the 2009 general election and ultimately the victory of the dmk-alliance-united Progressive Alliance
 diemke ke virdohi, kuch raajnneetik prekshak or diemke party ke sabase-varisht sadsy is baat kii aalochana karte hai ki karunanidhi nehru-gandhi parivaar kii tarj par ek raajnneetik vanshavaad shuru karne kii koshish main stallin ko badhaava dene kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Waiko, who left the DMK, has been the most outspoken and some political observers see this as a move to shore up Vaiko as he was seen as a threat to Stalin
 haalaanki diemke ke sutron or jin logon ne 70 or 80 ke dashak kii raajnneetik uthal-puthal ko dekha he ve iskaa khandan karte hai or kehete hai ki stallin apni swayan kii yogyata ke aadhaar par aage aaye hai
 He says that Stalin has progressed because of his footsteps, having faced many hardships since 1975 when he was jailed under MISA and beaten so brutally inside the prison during the Emergency That his fellow DMK party prisoner was killed in an attempt to save him
 stallin 1989 or 1996 main ek vidhayak the jab unke pita karunanidhi mukhyamantri the, lekin unhen mantrimandal main shaamil nahin kiya gaya tha
 He fought his own battle and became the 44th mayor of Chennai in 1996 in which he was elected as the first directly elected mayor
 vidhayak ke rup main yah unka chauthaa kaarykaal tha jab unhen karunanidhi mantrimandal main ek mantri banaaya gaya, is tarah unki pragati dhimi or sthir he
 They further state that Karunanidhi even expelled his other sons MK Muthu and MK Azhagiri for being found guilty of wrongdoing
 stallin, apni sauteli bahan kanimojhi ke saath milakar karodon kii sampatti jutaney vaale e raja ko samarthan dene ke liye apane pita ke khilaaf hai

 At the same time, he increased the taxes and jizya at all three levels and stayed the decision of his predecessors who had liberated the Hindu Brahmins from jizya tax
