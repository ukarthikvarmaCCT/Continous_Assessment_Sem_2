 Deflation occurs only when the rate of annual inflation falls below the zero percent rate, resulting in an increase in the real value of the currency - allowing a buyer to buy more than that amount
 ise avasfiti, mudrasphiti ke dar main kami, samajhane kii bhul nahin kii jaani chahie
 As inflation decreases over time the real value of the currency, on the contrary, deflation is the rise in the real value of the currency - the functional currency in the national or regional economy
 vartmaan samay main, mukhyadhara ke arthshaastriyon kaa aamtaur par maananaa he ki apsfitikari jatiltaaon ke khatre ) ke kaaran aadhunik arthvyavastha main apsfiti ek samasya he
 Deflation is also associated with economic slowdown and worldwide recession, such as banks defaulting in depositors' repayment

 Historically, however, not all incidents of deflation have been associated with seizures of weak economic growth
 paaramparik arthshaastriyon ke dwaara apsfiti shabd kaa prayog mudra kii aapurti evam rin main giravat ko sandarbhit karne ke liye vaikalpik arth main kiya jaataa tha; kuch arthshaastriyon ne jinamein austrian vichaardhaara ke arthshaastri shaamil hai, abhi bhi is shabd kaa prayog isi arth main karte hai
 These two meanings are related to each other, as the supply of money becomes a possible cause of a decline in the normal price level
 IS / LM model main, maal or byaaj ke liye aapurti or maang vakr rekha main parivartan, visheshkar maang ke str main kul giravat ke kaaran apsfiti aati he
 That is, how much there has been a decline in the willingness to purchase in the whole economy and how much the prices of goods are going to increase

 As this idle capacity also leads to a decline in investment, consequently, further demand also leads to a reduction in aggregate demand
 yah apsfitikaarak ghumaav he
 The response to the decline in aggregate demand is encouraging, either through an increase in the money supply from the central bank, or by increasing the demand by the fiscal authority to take loans at the interest rate available to private companies
 mudrasphiti kaa vipareet prabhaav padataa he or is prakaar pehle hi vyapaarik mandi aa jaati he
 For example, the prices of these essential commodities skyrocketed before the 2008 year trade slowdown
 haal filhal kii aarthik vichaardhaara main, apsfiti jokhim se judy hui he: jahaan parisampattiyon par jokhim-samyojit pratilabh neeche utar kar nakaaratmak ho jate hai, niveshak or kreta nivesh karne yahaan tak ki sabase thos pratibhutiyon main bhi nivesh karne kii bajaay mudra batorenge or jamaa karenge
 This can lead to a theoretical situation, on which the practical possibility of liquidity fund has been much debated

 In the internal economy system, this means that holding zero interest would mean zero return on government securities, or negative return on short-term maturity
 In the open economy, it gives rise to trade and devalues the currency without setting exports to the same level by setting higher prices for imports
 mudravaadi siddhant main, apsfiti kaa sambandh nirantar ghatate hue mudra veg athwa lenden kii sankhya se he
 This has been attributed to the dramatic contraction of the money supply, perhaps in response to the declining exchange rate, or in response to gold standard or other external monetary infrastructure requirements
 apsfiti ko aamtaur par rinatmak samajha jaataa he, kyonki iske kaaran udhaarkartaaon or arthsulabh aastiyon ke dharakon se sampatti kaa hastantaran ho jaataa he, jisase sanchayakartaaon evam mudra tathaa arthsulabh parisampattiyon ke dharakon ko laabh pahunchataa he
 In this sense it is the exact opposite of inflation, which is similar to taxation in favor of borrowers and short-term consumption for currency holders and lenders
 aadhunik arthvyavastha main, maang main giravat ke kaaran apsfiti aati he or yah mandi se judy hoti he or dirghakaalik aarthik mandi se judy ho
 In the modern economy, the terms of debt have become longer and financing for debt is common for all types of investments, now even the penalties associated with deflation have increased substantially
 chunki apsfiti nivesh ko nirutsahit karti hai, kyonki bhavishya main hone vaale laabh par jokhim uthaane kaa koi sangat kaaran nahin he jabaki laabh kii pratyaasha hi nakaaratmak he or bhavishya kii keemton kii apeksha karnaa ummid se kam he, is kaaran hi aksar kul maang main achaanak giravat aa jaati he
 Simply holding the currency 'without hidden risks' of inflation, neither spending it nor investing it, can be prudent

 When this happens, the available amount of the rare currency decreases per person, as a result the currency becomes even more vain; And because of this, the ability to purchase each unit of currency increases
 19veen sadi kaa antim bhaag in paristhitiyon main aarthik vikaas ke saath-saath anwarat aati hui apsfiti kaa udhaaharan pesh karata he
 Deflation also occurs when improving the efficiency of production causes a decrease in the total price of goods
 aamtaur par utpaadan kii kshamta main sudhaar kaa kaaran yah hota he ki vastuon or sevaaon ke aarthik nirmaataa utpaadan main sudhaar ke falswaroop munaafe kii margin kii badhottaree ke vaayade se abhiprerit hote he
 Competition in the market often prompts those producers to reduce the arbitrary price of their goods by adding at least a fraction of their cost savings
 When this happens, consumers pay less for those goods and this results in deflation, as the ability to purchase is increased
 jab kisi kii mudra kii kray karne kii kshamta main vruddhi laabhprad lagati he, yah vastav main kathinaayee paidaa kar saktaa he jab kisi ke nival mulya kaa bada hissaa arthsulabh astiyo main jaise ki makaan, zamin tathaa duusare roopon main nijee sampattiyon main laga hota he
 It also increases the burden of debt because - after some significant period of deflation - when someone pays to service the debt, it represents a larger amount of purchasing and not when the loan first originated
 natijatan, apsfiti ko kisi rin byaaj dar kii chaaya ke pravardhan ke rup main bhi mana ja saktaa he
 If during the catastrophic recession of the United States, deflation averages at 10% per annum, debt at 0% also becomes unviable as it is required to be repaid annually at a higher cost value of 10%
 kyonki Under normal circumstances, the Fed and most other central banks set a target for short-term interest rates to set the rate of federal funds overnight in the United States - and to achieve these goals by buying and selling securities in the open capital market Implement policies for
 jab alpakaalik byaaj dar shunya par pahunch jaati he, kendriya bank ab apni saamaanya byaaj dar ko ghataakar apni niti main lacheelaapan nahin laa sakate hai
 General methods of regulating the supply of money may be ineffective, even if the short-term interest rate is reduced to zero, the resultant "real" interest rate will remain high; Therefore, other tips for increasing the supply of money, such as purchase of assets or quantitative easing, have to be made effective
 sanyukt rajya america ke fedral rigerv ke vartmaan adhyaksh, ben barnanke ne, san 2002 main kaha, "mudra kaa paryaapt antah kshepan antat: hameshaa hi vipareet apsfiti utpann karegaa
" Proponents of cash money argue that deflation should have a welcome impact if there are no "hardwalls" in an economy, as a reduction in prices may shift the effort of the economy to other activity sectors
 Thus the total product of the economy may increase
 is siddhant kii kuch arthshaastriyon ne aalochana kii he, jo yah maanate he ki agar sakhtiyaan nahin hongi to na hi mudrasphiti kaa or na hi apsfiti kaa ullekhneey prabhaav padegaa
 Since periods of deflation are supported by those who hold the currency for those who do not own the currency, it is often compared to periods of increasing populism, as the United States populists by the end of the 19th century had scarce currency
 Wanted to do more inflationary silver metal currencies based on the standards of
 apsfitikar chakra ek ansi avasthaa hai jab keemton main giravat utpaada ko gata detii he, jo badale main vetan or maang ko bhi kam kar detii he jisase aage chalakar bhi mulya main giravat aati he
 Since deficits in the normal price-level are called deflation, the deflationary cycle arises only when the price cut leads to a dangerous cycle where the problem itself becomes the reason for the increase
 kuch log apsfitikar chakra ko hi mahaan mandi kii vajah maanate hai
 Deflationary cycles do occur quite controversially indeed
 apsfitikar chakra 19veen sadi ke vivaadon aam vivaadon kii bharbhaar se vyutpann samshti arthshaastra kaa aadhunik sanskaran he
 The second ideology related to this is Irving Fisher's theory that excessive debt can lead to sustained deflation

 Deflation can arise from the combination of demand and supply of goods and demand and supply of money in the mainstream of economics, especially when the supply of money decreases and the supply of goods increases

 a study by Ben Bernanke on the Great Recession indicated that, in response to the dwindling demand, the Federal Reserve at the time reduced the supply of money, thus supporting deflation
 apsfiti ke chaar prakaar ke bhed batalaaye gaye hai
 Two are in favor of demand and two are in favor of supply: mudravaadi pariprekshya main apsfiti mukhyatah mudra veg main kami ke kaaran aati he or / athwa mudra kii rakam prati vyakti mudra kii aapurti par nirdhaarit hoti he
 In a debt-dependent modern economy, deflationary highs can arise by initiating higher interest rates, which may cause asset bubbles to break quickly or a controlled economy to crumble at a higher level of production than what it could actually support
 Was working rin par nirbharsheel arthvyavastha main, mudra kii aapurti main giravat ullekhneey rup se udhaar dene ko kam karti he, jisase aage chalakar mudra kii aapurti main teji se maang main bhi teji se giravat aa jaati he
 Demand declines and, along with demand decline, prices decrease as the abundance of supply develops

 Businesses do not get enough profit because some do not get spoiled, so they are liquidated

 To reduce or prevent deflationary high velocity, banks often stop repayment of unprocessed loans
 This is often a way of bridging the gap because they must then curb lending, as they do not have the money to lend, which further reduces demand, and so on

 When the central bank has lowered the nominal interest rate to zero, it can no longer boost demand by lowering further interest rates

 By the 1930s, economists generally believed that deflation would treat itself
 jaise hi keemten kam hongi, maang main swaabhaavik rup se vruddhi aa jaayegi or aarthik pranali bina bahari hastkshep ke apana sudhar swayan kar legi

 spectrumiki, bhautikee vigyaan kii ek shakha he jisamen padaarthon dwaara utsarjit yaa avashoshit vidyut chumbakeey vikiranon ke spectrumon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he or is adhyayan se padaarthon kii aantarik rachana kaa gyaan praapt kiya jaataa he
 This branch mainly studies the spectrum, hence it is called spectrometry or spectrometry
 mulat: vikiran evam padaarth ke bich antarkriya ke adhyayan ko spectrumiki yaa spectroscopy kaha jaataa tha
 In fact, spectroscopy used to refer to different frequencies when visible light passes through a prism
 baad main 'spectroscopy' shabad ke arth kaa vistaar hua
 Now the measurement of any amount as a function of wavelength is called spectroscopy
 isaki paribhaasha kaa or vistaar tab mila jab urja ko char raashi ke rup main sammilit kar liya gaya The graph of an amount as a function of frequency is called an alphabet
 kisi padaarth ke kisi dravyaman main yanon, parmaanuon yaa anuon kii upasthiti kii saghanta kaa maapan spectrometry kehalaata he
 Instruments that are helpful in spectrometry are known by the names of spectrometers, spectrophotometers or spectrographs
 spectrscopy / spectrometry kaa upyog bhautik evam vaishleshik rasayan vigyaan main bahudhaa kiya jaataa he
 It is also used in astronomy and remote sensing
 spectrumiki kii neenv ijec newton ne san 1666 i
 main daali thi
 They let the solar beam go through a prism to the curtain, coming from a window hole in a closed room
 parde par saat rangon par bangnee rang tha
 Seven colors in the bandage - red, orange, yellow, green, sky, blue and purple - were visible in this order
 newton ne is pattee ko "spectrum" kaha
 With this experiment he proved that the white light of the sun is actually a mixture of seven colors
 bahut samay tak "spectrum" kaa arth isi satarangi pattee se hi lagaaya jaataa tha
 Later, scientists noticed that even under the violet color of the solar spectrum, some rocks are found which are not visible by the eye but affect the photoplat and can be photographed
 in kirnon ko parabangnee kirane kaha jaataa he
 Similarly, infrared rays are found above red color
 vastav main sabhi varna kii rashmiyaan vidyut chumbakeey tarangen hoti hai
 Color light, infrared, ultraviolet light, X-rays, gamma-rays, micro waves and radio waves - all of these are electromagnetic waves
 in sabakaa spectrum hota he
 The wavelength of the green rays emitted by stirring the mercury is 5461 Engstrom
 at: ab vibhinn varna kii rashmiyon kaa vibhaajan rang ke aadhaar par nahin varan tarangadairghy ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he or spectrum kaa arth bahut vyapak ho gaya he - tarangadairghy ke anusaar rashmiyon kii suvyavastha ko spectrum kaha jaataa he
 Spectromatology deals with almost all types of electromagnetic waves
 sookshm tarang spectrumiki, infrared-spectrumiki, drishy kshetra spectrumiki, eks kiranspectrumiki or newclear-spectrumiki aadi sabhi vibhaag spectrumiki ke hi ang hai kintu prachlit arth main spectrumiki ke antargat avarakt, drishy tathaa parabangnee kirnon ke spectrum kaa adhyayan hi aata he
 The "spectrum" that Newton obtained from the sun's rays was not pure, meaning that all colors were not completely separate from the nearby colors; One color was mixed with another
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki unhone kirnon ko ek gol chhed se lekar prism par daalaa tha
 In 1802 AD, Wollaston obtained pure spectrum by using narrow wrinkles in place of round holes
 aage chalakar joseph frounhophar ne prism kii sahaayta se shuddh spectrum praapt kiya or samtal grating kaa avishkaar kiya
 Grating is another device that reflects the colors of different colors
 spectrumiki kii pragati main frounhophar kaa kaary vishisht mahatv rakhata he
 In 1859, Kirkhaf and Bunashan took a spectrum of many pure elements and stated that they are completely different from each other
 kirkhof or bunshan ne yah bhi siddh kiya ki koi padaarth uttejit hone par jis varna kii rashmiyaan de saktaa he, kam taap par keval usee varna kii rashmiyaan de saktaa he, kam taap par keval usee varna kii rashmiyon ko avashoshit bhi kar saktaa he
 After knowing these elements, the progress of spectroscopy took place with great intensity
 is vigyaan ne anu parmaanuon kii rachana kaa gyaan praapt karaane main mahattam yogadan kiya he
 a substance is stimulated by giving it electricity or heat, then light comes out from it
 us padaarth se nikalanevaali rashmiyon kaa spectrum uski aantarik rachana par nirbhar karata he
 If a solid substance is heated enough that it starts glowing intensely, the spectrum it receives is called a continuous spectrum, because the strips of different characters are mixed with each other, there is no limit
 bijli ke balb tathaa surya se aisa hi spectrum praapt hota he
 Conversely, if a substance is given so much energy that its atoms get excited, it gives a linear spectrum
 isamen vibhinn varna kii tikshn rekhaayen pai jaati hai
 The electric arc and some wires also provide linear spectrum
 spectrum kii ek teesri shrenee bhi hoti he
 If electrically immersed in a gas at low pressure, those gases give excited spectrum
 is spectrum main ek duusare se pruthak bahut se patt paae jate hai jinka ek sira tikshn or doosraa kramash: dhoomil hota he
 All these spectrums are called emitted spectrums
 yadi kisi padaarth ke bheetar se sabhi varna kii rashmiyaan bheji jaaen to vah un rashmiyon ko, jinhen swayan utsarjit kar saktaa he, avashoshit kar letaa he
 All the characters of the scene from the electric bulb emanate
 yadi kisi nalee main sodium kii bhaap bhari ho or uske bheetar se balb kaa prakaash bhejkar bahirgat prakaash kaa spectrum liya jaae to uske pile bhaag main do kaali rekhaayen pai jaati hai
 The reason for this is that sodium itself gives a linear spectrum when excited
 is spectrum main do pilo rekhaayen bhi hoti hai jinhen sodium kii "di" rekhaayen kaha jaataa he
 When the light of the bulb passes through the steam of sodium, the sodium absorbs the character corresponding to the d lines and two black lines are formed at this place in the light
 is spectrum kaa avasorana spectrum kehete hai
 There are also three types of absorption spectrums
 jis avasorana spectrum main kaali rekhaayen pai jaati hai unhen rekhiy avasorana spectrum, jinamein kaale band paae jate hai unhen band avasorana spectrum or jinamein spectrum kaa thodaa sa adhik satat kshetra hi avashoshit ho jaataa he unhen satat avasorana spectrum kehete hai
 The instruments used to obtain spectrum are called spectroscopes, spectrometers and spectrographs
 prayek spectrolekhi spectrodarshi main teen mukhya avyav hote hai
 The first part controls the quantities coming from the source in the proper direction, the second part separates the different characters i
e
 the mixed particles and the third part focuses them on a different nucleus
 yadi upkaran main keval spectrum dekhne maatr kii hi vyavastha ho to use spectrodarshi kehete hai, yadi uske tisare bhaag ko ghumaakar spectrum ke vibhinn varnon kaa vichlan padhane kii vyavastha bhi ho to use spectromapi kehete hai isse spectrum kaa sthaayee chitra liya ja saktaa he
 All spectrographics are nearly identical in texture, but two means of reflection are used - prism and grating
 isiilie spectrolekhi bhi do prakaar ke hote hai - prism spectrolekhi or grating spectrolekhi
 The spectrum has been divided into different regions to facilitate study
 yah vibhaajan teen baton ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he - rashmistrot, parikshepan vidhi or abhilekhan 
 The following areas are studied in the Department of Spectroscopy - the far infrared field of view, the ultraviolet field and the vacuum ultraviolet field
 vibhinn bhaagon main vibhinn prakaar ke spectrolekhi kaam aate hai
 The table gives a brief description of the range of different areas, dispersion instruments and recording devices
 spectrum teen prakaar ke hote hai, - rekhiy, pattdaar tathaa satat
 Kel lines are found in the linear spectrum
 pattdaar spectrum main patt band paae jate hai jinka ek kinaaraa tikshn or doosraa kramash: dhoomil hota he
 In continuous spectrum all the characters of the characters are attached to each other
 vibhinn prakaar ke spectrum paane ke liye upyukt rashmistrot kaam main laae jate hai
 The linear spectrum is obtained by excited atoms
 inhen uttejit karne ke liye ooshmaa, vidyut yaa atyadhik urjayukta vidyucchumbakeey rashmiyon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Usually electric arcs and electric sparks are used
 jwaala, taap bhatthi tathaa vidyut visarjan dwaara bhi parmaanuon ko uttejit kiya jaataa he
 Electric arc - Two metal electrodes are tightened in a particular type of column but remain isolated from the column
 ek scruhed ko ghumaakar electrodon ke bich kaa rikt sthaan kam yaa adhik kiya ja saktaa he
 Both electrodes are combined into a variable resistor and an inductive series
 arq chalaane ke liye aarambh main donon electrode sata die jate hai at: vidyut paripath puraa ho jaataa he or dhara pravaahit hone lagati he
 At the point where the electrodes are connected, a large amount of heat is generated, because there is a very low barrier, and thousands of amperes of current flow
 is ushma ke kaaran electrode ke agr bhaag vashpit ho jate hai or unhen thodaa vilag karne par bhi yah bhaap vidyut paripath ko puraa kiye rahati he
 The molecule-atoms located in this part get excited and give light
 arq kaa tapakram lagbhag 3500 sein
 se 8000 sein
 tak hota he
 The difference between the electrodes before running the main wire arc is equal to the difference of the mains but it decreases while moving the arc
 prayavartidhara se bhi arq chalaae jate hai
 Many types of improvised arcs are available nowadays
 electric sphuling - kii rachana lagbhag arq kii hi bhanti hoti he kintu sphuling ke electrodon kaa vibhavantar arq kii apeksha kai sau guna adhik hota he
 This is the reason why the column of sphurling is kept more secure and well detached from the electrodes
 electrodon ko ek stassop transafarmar ke secondary siron se jod diya jaataa he
 Diffusion of spilling spaces 10,000 v Up to 50,000 volts; Thus, atoms in this source are highly excited
 sphuling rikt sthaan icchaanusaar ghataya badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Molecule atoms excited in this source receive a lot of energy
 at: ve ynit ho jate hai
 Many electrons revolve around the nucleus of an atom or molecule
 ye electron nishchit niyam ke anusaar vibhinn kakshaon main bante rahete hai
 The electrons in the outermost orbit are called "optical electrons"
 yadi kisi anu yaa parmaanu main se ek yaa adhik optical electron nikaal die jaaen to vah "ynit" kaha jaataa he
 When only one electron is released, the atom is in the first ionized state
 yadi duusare, tisare aadi electron bhi nikal jaaen to parmaanu kramash: duusari, teesri aadi ynit sthiti main chalaa jaataa he
 These conditions require progressively more energy
 atyant ucch vibhavantar par chalanevaale sphuling se tin kii 23veen ynit sthiti praapt kii ja chuki he
 Electrophoresis is mainly useful for spectro chemical analysis
 sphuling ko sthir rup se der tak chalaane ke liye isamen vividh prakaar ke sudhaar kiye gaye hai
 The banded spectrum is obtained by igniting the material or burning in a flame of Bunsen volcano
 kuch padaarthon ko vidyut arq main prajvalit karne se bhi pattdaar spectrum praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 The banded spectrum is obtained from a large facility by the electrical immersion in gases
 vidyut visarjan ke liye gas ko bahut kam daab par ek nalee main bharkar uske siron ke bich kai hajaar volt kaa vibhavantar dena padataa he
 Blood vessels are produced by the electric immersion in neon gas
 aajkal pradarshan or prachaar ke liye aksharon or chitron ke aakaar kii visarjan naliyaan banaai jaati hai jinamein nion gas bhari rahati he
 These are called neon signs
 kisi thos padaarth ko itani ooshmaa di jaae ki vah laal hokar chamakane lage to usase satat rashmipunj nikalataa he
 Special types of hydrogen lamps, xenon arc lamps and mercury-vapor immersion are used to obtain continuous spectrum in the field of view from electric bulbs
 vibhinn prakaar ke rashmisroton se jo rashmiyaan nikalati hai unka sthaayee spectrum praapt karne ke liye spectrolekhi kaam main laae jate hai
 The reflecting plant brought into each spectrograph separates mixed colors of different colors
 rashmiyon kaa parikshepan teen ritiyon se hota he: When the rings pass through a prism, they are separated due to refraction
 ise apvartaneey parikshepan kehete hai; If several narrow wrinkles are placed near parallel to each other and a mixed light beam is sent from them, due to diffraction, the rocks are separated and the spectrum is formed
 aise parikshepan ko vivartaneey parikshepan kehete hai; Detachment is also produced by interfering with the stones
 pehali do reetiyaan adhik prachlit hai
 It has three main parts - collimator, prism and camera
 collemetter ek khokhli nalee hoti he jiske ek sire par patali zairi or duusare sire par lens laga hota he
 The distance of the bush and lens are variable and the width of the bush is also variable and the width of the bush is also variable
 prism ek drudh aadhaar par is prakaar rakhaa jaataa he
 That the parallel Rashmipunj coming from the lens should fall on it
 prism se parikshepit rashmiyaan camere main jaati hai or camera lens dwaara photoplate par kendrit kii jaati hai
 The entire system is covered together in such a way that the light cannot go anywhere other than Jhiri
 saamanyat: drishy or parabangnee kshetra main kaam aanevaale spectrograph aise hi hote hai
 Spectroscopy used in the field of view includes glass lenses and prisms
 parabangnee kshetra ke liye quartz, fluoride tathaa fluoride ke prism or lens kaam aate hai
 Useful prisms for remote infrared are not found
 vikshepan badhaane ke liye do yaa teen prism vaale spectrolekhi banaae gaye hai
 Such spectrographs are used for vacuum ultraviolet fields from which air is removed
 inhen nirvaat spectrograph kehete hai
 They are very valuable
 avarakt ke liye vishesh prakaar ke spectromapi kaam main laae jate hai
 An infrared spectrometer gives the adsorption spectrum of a substance
 satatvarni infrared rashmiyon ko padaarth se hokar jane diya jaataa he
 These are deflected by a prism or grating after the material is released
 vikshepit rashmiyon kaa abhilekh tapavidyut ricarderon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The prisms of chloride and fluoride are placed in these spectrometers and metallic mirror mirrors are replaced by lenses
 kai sankri jhiriyon ko samanaantar rakhkar jo zairismooh banaaya jaataa he use grating kehete hai
 If parallel lines are scratched on a clean transparent glass, then the transparent space between each of the two lines is allowed to fall
 aise shishe ko samtal pargami grating kehete hai
 Their use is limited like prisms
 yadi kisi vakratal par aluminium yaa chaandi kii kalai kii jaae or isi par samaantar rekhaayen khurch di jaaen to yah upkaran avatal paravartak grating kaha jaataa he
 The plane between each of the two lines reflected the spheres, the spectrum obtained from the diffraction of these reflected spheres
 is prakaar kii grating sarvapratham henry rolad ne san 1882 i
 main banaai thi
 Rolling machine was also made by Roland to scrape the lines, which is still prevalent in the improved form
 vakr grating spectrolekhi main lens kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 Rashmipunj falls on a grating through a narrow bush
 paravartit rashmiyaan swat: ek vrutt par kendrit ho jaati hai
 This circle is called "roland circle"
 jis vakratal par rekhaayen khurchi jaati hai use "grating blike" kehete hai
 The radius of the Roland circle is half the curvature of "black"
 yah vrutt grating ko us sthaan par sparsh karata he jahaan iskaa vyas-grating par abhilamb hota he
 At the other end of this feature, a direct image of the jhiri is formed
 ise shunya koti kaa spectrum kehete hai
 The first spectrum found on the Roland circle on both sides is called the first-order spectrum
 isi vrutt par or aage kramash: kam tivrata ke kai spectrum milte hai
 These are called second, third etc

 spectrolekhi kii upyogita do baton par nirbhar karti he
 The first is its dispersion ability and the second is its resolution
 kisi spectrolekhi main parikshepak sanyantr se nikalne par vibhinn tarangadairghy kii rashmiyaan ek duusari se jitna hi adhik pruthak ho jaati hai us spectrolekhi kii parikshepan kshamta utana hi adhik hoti he
 Similarly, the ability to show two extremely proximal wavelength lines exactly apart from each other is called differentiation
 yadi kisi spectrum main do aisi rekhaayen lee jaaen jinamein ek kaa tarangadairghy λ { \ displaystyle { \ lambda }} or duusari kaa λ { \ displaystyle { \ lambda }} + δ λ { \ displaystyle { \ Delta \ lambda }} ho to adhik vibhedankshamtawale spectrolekhi main donon rekhaayen ek duusari se alag dikhaai detii hai kintu kam vibhedak spectrolekhi main donon milakar keval ek hi rekha dikhaai padati he
 Differentiation is expressed by the following ratio
 r = λ δ λ { \ displaystyle R={ \ lambda \ over \ Delta \ lambda }} Photographs of dispersed particles are captured in the spectrograph
 ise spectrolekhi kehete hai
 The photographs are recorded where photos cannot be taken
 photo utaarne tathaa abhilekhan ke liye jo upkaran kaam aate hai unhen "dictator" kaha jaataa he
 Different types of dictators are used in various fields of spectrometry

 The reciprocal distances of the lines are measured with the help of a tool called a campator
 prayek parmaanu main ek nabhik hota he
 Many electrons revolve around it in fixed orbits
 electronon kii kul sankhya nabhik ke potanon kii sankhya ke baraabar hoti he
 The number of electrons in different orbitals is also fixed
 koi bhi electron kisi niyat kaksha main hi rah saktaa he
 In fact, these orbits represent the energy position of the atom
 yadi koi electron kisi anya rikt kaksha main chalaa jaae to parmaanu kii urjasthiti badal jaati hai
 It is often not possible to remove the electrons from the inner orbits, but the electrons from the final orbit can move to the next orbit when excited by external heat or electric power
 yadi pehali kaksha main usase sambhddha urja k1 or usase thik agali kaksha main k2 he to pehali se duusari ucchtar urjasthiti main jane ke liye electron keval k2 - k1 urja hi le saktaa he
 Only after going to the excited level does he return to the former position and emit the energy K2 - K1
 is utsarjit yaa avashoshit urja kaa maan hn hi hota he arthath electron ek urjaster se thik agle urjaster main jane yaa waapas aane main nishchit urja nd arg hi le saktaa he yaa de saktaa he
 This cannot cause less energy to be exchanged
 h ek sthir sankhya he or n utsarjit rashmi kii aavriti he
 hn arg is called a packet or "quantum" of energy
 isi prakaar jab electron anya urjastaron main sankraman karata he to bhinn-bhinn aavriti kii rashmiyaan praapt hoti hai or spectrum main tadnukool bahut si rekhaayen ban jaati hai
 According to the arrangement of electrons in molecules, atoms are found to have many electronic energy levels and different types of spectrum are obtained due to electronic transition
 parmaanuon main keval electranik urjasthitiyaan hi pai jaati hai
 Therefore, the transition of electrons emits particles of fixed wavelength and gives linear spectrum
 anuon main teen prakaar kii urja hoti he - electranik, kampanjnya or ghurnanjanya 
 The electronic energy value is even lower
 jis prakaar electranik urjasthitiyaan niyat hai usee prakaar kampanjnya or ghurnanjanya urja kii sthitiyaan bhi niyat hai
 Hence a band or band is obtained by vibrational transition
 prayek bed main ghurnanjanya sankraman se rekhaayen praapt hoti hai
 They are very close, so small spectroscopes are not seen separately and only bands of different characters are visible in the spectrum

 Molecules of more than two atomic molecules have even closer lines, so they are harder to see

 Ramcharit composed by Tulsidas ji takes some of the quadrupeds of Manas
 baat us samay kii he jab manu or satarupa parambrahm kii tapasya kar rahe the
 After doing penance for many years, Shankarji himself said to Parvati that I, Brahma and Vishnu came to Manu Satarupa many times to give brides, which is mentioned in the Ramcharitmanas composed by Tulsi Das ji like this- "bidhi hari har aapa dekhri Apara, Manu came close to Bahu Bara "
 jaisaa kii uparokt chaupai se pataa chalata he ki ye log to kai baar aaye yah kehane ki jo var tum maanganaa chaahate ho maang lo; par manu satarupa ko to putr rup main swayan parambrahm ko hi maanganaa tha phir ye kaise unase yani shankar, brahma or vishnu se var maangate? hamaare prabhu shriram to sarvajna hai
 They automatically know the desire of the devotee's heart

 Mangu Mangu Baru Bhai Nabhi Bani, the most sincere graceful mourner
 
 "when Manu Satarupa hears this Akash Vani, then his heart becomes elated
 or jab swayan parambrahm ram prakat hote hai to unki stuti karte hue manu or satarupa kehete hai- "sunu sevak surtaru suradhenu, bidhi hari har bandit pad renu
 Sevat Sulabh gross pleasing, Pranatpal Sachrachar Nayak अर्थात् "ie those whose feet are worshiped by Hari and Hari i

 Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh, and whose nature is praised both by virtue and virtue: what will they ask for? By mentioning this thing, Tulsi Baba has also advised those who worship Rama only to worship the formless

 It is known from the talk literature of Vallabh sect that the river Yamuna used to flow near Jamunavati village in Saraswat Kalpa
 us kaal main yamuna nadi kii do dharaain thi, ek dhara nandagaanv, varasanaa, sanket ke nikat bahati hui govardhan main jamunaavati par aati thi or duusari dhara pirghat se hoti hui gokul kii ore chali jaati thi
 Further, both streams used to move towards present Agra
 parasauli main yamuna ko dhara pravaahit hone kaa pramaan sa
 1717 tak miltaa he
 Although it is hard to believe
 shri gangaaprasad kamthaan ne brajabhasha ke ek musalmaan bhakt kavi karbeg upmaan kaare kaa vrutant prakashit kiya he
 According to Kabeg's statement, he was a resident of village Parasauli on the banks of the Jamuna and had created his work in 1717
 vartmaan samay main saharanpur jile ke faijabad gaanv ke nikat maidan main aane par yah aage 65 mile tak badhati hui haryana ke ambala or karnal jilon ko uttar pradesh ke saharanpur or mujffarnagar jilon se alag karti he
 In this terrain, rivers named Mascara, Kath, Hindon and Sabi are found, due to which its size increases greatly
 maidan main aate hi isse purvi yamuna nahar or pashchimi nahar nikaali jaati hai
 Both these canals take water from Yamuna and make the earth green and rich in hundreds of miles of this land
 is bhu-bhaag main yamuna kii dhara ke donon ore punjab or uttar pradesh ke kai chote bade nagaron kii seemayen hai, kintu iske thik tat par basaa hua sabase pracheen or pehla nagar dilli he, jo lambe samay se bharat kii rajdhani he
 It reaches a place called Okhla, catering to the needs of millions of male and female residents of Delhi and sweeping away the filth
 yahan par is par ek bada baandh baandha gaya he jisase nadi kii dhara puri tarah niyantrit kar lee gayi he
 From this dam comes the Agra Canal, which irrigates hundreds of miles of land in Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh
 dilli se aage yah haryana or uttar pradesh kii seemaa banaati hui tathaa haryana ke faridabad jile ko uttar pradesh ke gajiabad jile se alag karti hui uttar pradesh main pravaahit hone lagati he
 The first entry of Yamuna river into the cultural boundary of Braj region is near the town called 'jaber' of Khurja tehsil of Bulandshahar district
 vahaan se yah dakshin kii ore bahati hui faridabad jile kii palaval tehsil or aligarh, uttar pradesh ke hathras jile kii khayr tehsil kii seemaa nirmit karti he

 Shergarh is the first notable place situated on the banks of Yamuna in the Braj region
 shergarh se kuch dur tak purv kii disha main bah kar phir yah mathura tak dakshin disha main hi bahati he
 On both sides of the route, Puranas are famous forest and park and Krishna Leela place
 yahan par yah bhant se vrindavan tak bal khaati hui bahati he or vrindavan ko yah teen ore se gher leti he
 It is known from the Puranas, in ancient times, there were many streams of Yamuna in Vrindavan, due to which it became almost like a peninsula
 usamen anek sundar vankhand or ghaas ke maidan the, jahaan bhagwaan shri krishna apane saathi gop baalkon ke saath gaayen charaaya karte the
 In the present day there is only one stream of Yamuna and Vrindavan is situated on its banks
 vahaan madhya kaal main anek dharmacharyon or bhakt kaviyon ne nivas kar krishnopasna or krishna bhakthi kaa prachaar kiya tha
 There are large beautiful ghats on the banks of the Yamuna in Vrindavan and there are many temples-shrines, chhatris and dharamshalas on them
 inase yamuna ke tat kii shobhaa adhik bad jaati he
 Flowing further south from Vrindavan, this river enters the city of Mathura
 mathura yamuna ke tat par basaa hua ek esa aitihaasik or dharmik sthaan he, jisaki dirghakalin gaurav gaatha prasiddh he
 Here Lord Krishna took an avatar, due to which its importance has increased
 yahan bhi yamuna ke tat par bade sundar ghat bane hue hai
 a panoramic view of Mathura city and its ghats is seen in Yamuna by boat or by bridge
 mathura main yamuna par do pakke pul bane hai jinamein se ek par railgadee chalati he tathaa duusare par sadak parivahan chalate hai
 Gokul barrage has now also been constructed on the southern border of Mathura city with the objective of bringing back the ground water level of Braj and making the fertile land of Braj more and more irrigated
 vigat kaal main yamuna mathura-vrindavan main ek vishaal nadi ke rup main pravaahit hoti thi, kintu jabase isse naharen nikaali gayi hai, tab se iskaa jaleey aakaar chota ho gaya he
 It takes its predecessor form only in rain
 us samay milon tak iskaa pani fail jaataa he
 Further from Mathura, on the left bank of the Yamuna there are religious places like Gokul and Mahavan and on the right bank there are villages like Aurangabad and Farah
 yahan tak yamuna ke kinare retile hai, kintu aage patharile or chattaani ho jate hai, jisase jal dhara bal khaati hui manoram rup main pravaahit hoti he
 The Yamuna near the village of Akos in Sadabad tehsil runs out of the boundary of Mathura district and then forms the boundary of Mathura and Agra districts to some extent
 sadabad tehsil ke mandaur gram ke paas yah agra jile main pravesh karti he
 There, rivers called Karban and Gambhir come together
 agra jile main pravesh karne par nagala akos ke paas iske pani se nirmit keetham jhil he, jo sailaaniyon ke liye badi aakarshak he
 a protected forest block has been constructed along the banks of the Yamuna from Keetham to Runkata, which is called 'surdas Forest'
 runakta ke sameep hi yamuna tat par 'goghaat' kaa vah pracheen dharmik sthal he, jahaan mahatma surdaas ne 12 varshon tak nivas kiya tha or jahaan unhone mahaprabhu ballabhacharya se diksha lee thi
 Among the coastal places of Yamuna, Agra is the largest city after Delhi
 yah ek prasiddh aitihaasik, vyapaarik env paryaton sthal he, jo mughal samraaton kii rajdhani bhi rah chukaa he
 It is situated at a great height from the Yamuna coast - Yamuna flows in the eastern part of Delhi, from north to south
 yahan par bhi yamuna par do pul nirmit hai
 The buildings on the Yamuna coast in Agra, the fort built by the Mughal emperors and the Taj Mahal are very famous for tourists
 agra nagar se aage yamuna ke ek ore firozabad or duusari ore fatehbaad jila or tehsil sthit he
 After them comes the famous religious and historical site of Bateshwar, where the cultural boundary of Braj ends
 bateshwar kaa pracheen naam 'saurapur' he, jo bhagwaan shri krishna ke pitamah shur kii rajdhani thi
 Here, the Yamuna has taken a big turn with force, making Bateshwar known as an island
 is sthaan par karthik poornama ko yamuna snaan kaa ek bada mela lagata he
 Beyond Bateshwar, Etawah is situated on the banks of the Yamuna as a city
 yah bhi agra or bateshwar kii bhanti oonchaai par basaa hua he
 The high banks on the banks of the Yamuna are not in the plain as much as in the districts of Agra and Etawah
 itawa se aage madhya pradesh kii prasiddh nadi chambal yamuna main aakar milti he, jisase iskaa aakaar visteern ho jaataa he, apane udgam se lekar chambal ke sangam tak yamuna nadi, ganga nadi ke samaanaantar bahati he
 Further, the difference between them becomes less and in the end they go to Prayag and they both get confluent
 chambal ke pashchaat yamuna nadi main milane vaali nadiyon main senger, choti sindh, batawa or ken ullekhneey hai
 After Etawah, Kalpi, Hamirpur and Prayag are the main towns of the Yamuna
 prayag main yamuna ek vishaal nadi ke rup main prastut hoti he or vahaan ke prasiddh aitihaasik kile ke neeche ganga main mil jaati he
 a huge bridge has been built over the Yamuna at Prayag, which is two storeyed
 ise uttar pradesh kaa vishaltam sethu mana jaataa he
 Due to the confluence of Yamuna and Ganga, Prayag has gained the importance of Tirtharaj
 yamuna nadi kii kul lambaai udgam se lekar prayag sangam tak lagbhag 860 mile he
 Yamuna is counted along with the Ganges in the most sacred and ancient rivers of India
 yamuna or ganga ke do aab kii punyabhumi main hi aaryon kii puraatan samskruti kaa gauravshaalee rup ban sakaa tha
 Yamuna is the only important river of Brajmandal
 jahaan tak braj samskruti kaa sambadh he, yamuna ko keval nadi kahana hi paryaapt nahin he
 In fact, it has been a subsidiary of Braj culture, inspiring its long tradition and the mainstay of its religious sentiment
 puranic anushrutiyon ke anusaar yah dem main yamuna ji ke ek hajaar naamon se uski pashasti kaa gayan kiya gaya he
 3 The devotees of Yamuna recite it daily every day
 brajabhasha ke bhakt kaviyon or visheshtah vallabh sampradaayi kaviyon ne giriraaj govardhan kii bhanti yamuna ke prati bhi atishay shraddha vyakt kii he
 There is hardly a poet of this community, who has not paid his poetic tribute to his Yamuna
 unka yamuna stuti sambandhi sahitya brajabhasha bhakthi kavy kaa ek ullekhneey ang he

 vartmaan samay main taanaashaahee yaa adhinayakawad us shashan-pranali ko kehete hai jisamen koi vyakti vidyaman niyamon kii andekhi karte hue danda ke bal se shashan karata he
 Monolithicism, dictatorship or dictatorship is the government of a person who has not gained power as a result of succession of governance and who has absolute sovereignty - that is, not only the entire political power arises from the resolve of the same but unlimited in terms of scope and time
 Not responsible for any other authority - and it is used in a very uncontrolled manner Sector does by return Ajtrption
 diktetar shabd ko sarvapratham prayukt karanevaale roman log the jo kuch vishisht prashaskon ko anumaanath: isliye diktetar kehete the ki unke koi salaahkaar nahin hote the
 Monopolyism or totalitarianism in the constitution of the Roman Republic was the provision of temporarily unlimited rights for a single individual in a crisis situation
 sankat tal jane par ekadhinaayak ke aseemit adhikaar bhi samaapt ho jate the or unhen chhodte samay use unke prayogon kaa puraa byoraa dena padataa tha
 Thus, the responsibility of the Legislative and the ruled was the main feature of the Act
 aadhunik yug main pratham vishwayuddh ke baad kisi ek vyakti yaa varg ke swaarth ke liye vidhaan kaa ulanghan ekadhinaayakatv kaa pramukh lakshan ho gaya
 In addition to exhausting the mind of the general public, war created a tendency to obey in all social areas by imposing military discipline in place of restraint
 sainya uddeshyon ke liye aavashyak satta ke kendrikaran ne logon ko is baat ke liye abhyast bana diya ki ve saamaajik samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye aisi nirankush satta ke nirnay maan len jo kisi ke prati uttaradaayi na ho
 In this situation, the democratic system seemed to disintegrate
 falat: yuddh se sarvaadhik prabhavit deshon main saamanyat: log aise 'louhpurush' ke swaagat ke liye tatpar the jo apane shaury, aatmavishvaas or katibaddhta ke bal par unka mat liye bina raashtra ke naam par apni ichha tathaa aadesh se samasyaon kaa samaadhaan kar de
 Therefore, for the people, generally, a monknayak became a hard working person who himself could become a national emblem with a mystical charm to awaken a sense of respect for himself and make people feel great on the basis that they are related to him
 ekadhinaayakatv kii pratham visheshta uske udgam main hai
 It is never established in any country and era by means which are considered legitimate in that country and era
 uske liye yah aavashyak he ki uski neenv vidhaan ke ulanghan par ho, yadhyapi uskaa astitv kisi vidhaan ke na maanane par ashrith nahin he
 Every monolithic element begins with an uprising and then for some reason, it can maintain its revolutionary form
 parantu uskaa uddeshy puraane vidhaan ke sthaan par nae vidhaan kii sthapana bhi ho saktaa he kyonki ekadhinaayakatv puraatan, jeern vyavastha kii asafalataa tathaa naveen vyavastha ke liye uske dhwans kii purvakalpana karata he
 Its second major feature is that unlike democracy, it operates in the hands of one person or class to rule over others
 tisare, sattadhari khule dhang se yah ghoshit karata he ki raashtra main uskaa ek vishisht sthaan he
 Therefore, in a broad sense, a monopolistic government is a system in which one or several members of the state openly and systematically exercise power over the entire nation - which they have gained from the violence resulting from the violation of all the legitimate rights and establishments of the past - in the government Those who do not participate, remain independent of the consent of the public
 sarkaar ke swaroop ke aadhaar par ekadhinaayakatv do virgo main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he : In individual monopolies, the monarch governs independently on the basis of the principle of 'furor' with the help of his personal employees
 furar kii visheshta yah he ki vah apane sahaayakon ke prati uttaradaayi nahin hota, varan apane se upar-raashtra, itihaas yaa ishwar-ke prati apana daayitv ghoshit karata he
 The furor appoints his assistants who employ the employees under him, and these workers then appoint their subordinates
 is prakaar puri vyavastha main nirvachanpaddati kaa koi sthaan nahin hota or sampurna dhaanchaa sarvopari charam bindu par avlambit hota he
 The collective monopolist consists of the leader responsible for the Furer's place; One category of leaders chooses higher-class leaders, each leader being responsible to their electors
 is prakaar sampurna dhaanchaa nimnatam aadhaar par avlambit hota he
 There can be two classes of monopolies depending on social powers
 atev yah vibhaajan shaasha tathaa sahaayak varg ke aadhaar par hota he
 There are three major modern types of class monopolies: military, party and administrative
 teesraa vargeekaran parimanatmak swaroop ke aadhaar par ho saktaa he; yatha, The three classifications of totalitarianism can also be related to each other
 yatha, sainya ekadhinaayakatv, nijee tathaa samuhik donon hi ho saktaa he
 All important monopolies have the characteristic of religious communalism, such as worship of the promoter with zeal and reverence for a specific method
 mahaan vyaktiyon se sanchalit, sadaiv aakarshak vichaardhaara se prerit, apane anuyaayiyon se kartavya ke rup main balidaan kii maang karata hua, ekadhinaayakatv sakriy vyakti dwaara sthapit sarkaar kaa ek swaroop he
 He carries with them the mighty and dynamic classes which are naturally prone to rebellion: for example, the army, the Shur class or the proletariat
 ekadhinaayak apane sankalp or bhav shasiton par aropit karata rahata he
 There are two means of this implantation: negative, positive
 nakaaratmak saadhan hai, aalochana ko rokna, virdohi bahumat yaa alpamat ko nasht karnaa, rajya sambandhi aavashyak or mahatvapurn tathyon ko gupt rakhana
 Aids to these means are: the abolition of Parliament, the dissolution of unions and parties, restrictions on the press, control over education, expulsion of major opponents, etc
 is sambandh main hinsa tathaa aatank kii bhi charchaa kii jaati hai, parantu vastut: ye ekadhinaayakatv kii keval praarambhik avasthaa ke lakshan hai jo saamanyat: krantikari or isliye avaidh hote hai
 If monolithicism is successful in passing through this stage, it usually establishes administrative legislation in place of violence and terror
 sainya ekadhinaayakatv saamanyat: inhen nakaaratmak sadhano se santusht rahata he; parantu varg ekadhinaayakatv inke atirikt sakaaratmak sadhano kaa bhi prayog karata he; yatha, prachaar dwaara adhinaayak ke bhaavon, vichaaron or maton kaa janata par aropan, icchaanukool janamat kaa srijan aadi
 Helpful tools for these tools are: the worship of national or class worshipers, the propagation of provocative music, the eloquent or the hate speech, giving military education to the whole nation for habit of obedience, preparing books for schools, propagating anti-ideology
 , To bribe politicians, journalists and scholars by bribing them
 parantu kisi bhi sabhy desh main, jiskaa nikat ateet audaaryavaadee yaa janatantric rahaa ho, ye saadhan ekadhinayakawad kii sthapana ke liye tab tak paryaapt nahin hai jab tak unke saath janata se lubhaavne aadarsho, yatha aagyaakaarita, anushaasan, satta, ekta, shakti, deshprem aadi ke liye satat apil na kii jaae or vyakti main apane nijee adhikaron ko ekadhinaayak ke haathon sompane kaa utsaahpurn bhav na ubhaara jaae
 For this, the expressions related to religion are distorted and converted into expressions of praise or worship of their state, nation, caste or class
 jis avaidh dhang se ekadhinaayakatv kii sthapana hoti he usee dhang ke atirikt uskaa unmoolan praaia: asambhav he
 Monolithicism prevents the nation from learning the methods of autonomous governance and hence the rivalry for power among individuals and classes after the death of a monopolist can lead to disaster for the nation
 adhinayakatantr vyavastha ke vyavhaar main itane laabh hai ki anek loktantric rajyon main janata loktantr main kuch logon kii manamaani karne kii swatantraaa se uubakar adhinayakatantr vyavastha kii kaamana karne lagati he
 If the reasons for the rise of the dictatorship are discovered, then it will be known that the country where there was despair, disarray, dissatisfaction and absence, the emergence of the dictatorship
 jin deshon main loktantr vyavastha logon main niraashaa tathaa abhaav utpann karne vaali bani, vahiin is vyavastha kii sthapana ho gai
 Even today, in many states, the public sees the dictatorship as good and fully supports the autocratic rulers
 isse yah spasht he ki adhinayakatantr main kuch aise gun hai jo anya vyavasthaaon kii saiddhanthik shreshthata ke baavjood is vyavastha ko apnaane ke liye prerana ke jimmedaar hai
 In short, the following benefits of such governance are- adhinayakatantr main shashan kushalta hoti he
 Due to all the power vested in one person, not only can decisions be taken quickly, but the implementation of decisions is also arranged
 adhinayakatantri vyavastha main shaasha se sabhi bhaybheet rahete hai is kaaran ve kaary main deree yaa shithilataa nahin kar sakate hai
 The entire administration is not only responsible towards the autocratic ruler, but is also alert, alert and active at all times
 isse shashan main kaary-dakshata aa jaati hai
 The second quality of this system is the rapid development of the country
 desh main ek hi netaa, ek hi yojana tathaa ek hi vikaas lakshya rahane se desh kii sampoorn shakti isi lakshya ke maarg ko prashast karne main prayukt hoti he
 Proper development and use of economic resources is possible
 desh ke vikaas ke liye ekta, shaanti va vyavastha kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Due to their solid system in the dictatorship, all the resources of the country can be put into development
 desh main ekta kii sthapana main adhinayakatantr bahut sahaayak rahata he
 By suppressing various parties and opponents, due to the establishment of one party and one leader in the country, the whole public becomes loyal to it
 netaa ke chaaron taraf, sari vyavasthaaen gunth jaati hai tathaa desh ek thos ekta ke sutara main bandha jaataa he
 The party or leader becomes a means of tying in unity and in that everyone starts to feel a sense of belongingness
 hitler va musolini isi tarah germany va italy ko ek karne main safal rahe the
 It is helpful in awakening the feeling of nationalism
 desh ke nagarikon ko parsparikta main baandhne ke liye ek vichaardhaara, ek dal va ek netaa kaa hona paryaapt hota hai
 All citizens are motivated by a sense of brotherhood
 ek raashtra kaa naaraa, ek hi jhande ke neeche sabko khadaa kar detaa he
 Desh bhakti has so much importance that citizens are ready to sacrifice even for their country and leader
 sankat kaal main taanaashaahee vyavastha sarvottam rahati he
 In this, due to all decisions and ideals given by one person to face the crisis, there is unity of orders
 isse samay par uchit kaarywahi karnaa saral ho jaataa he
 This system gives victory in wartime crisis
 adhinayakatantr vyavastha main desh kaa bahumukhi vikaas hota he
 There is also a system of rapid development in the economic sector
 ekta, anushaasan va kartavya-parayanata ke kaaran vikaas kii shreshth vyavastha ho jaati he
 The history of Russia, Germany, China, Italy, Turkey and Spain so far is a testimony to this fact
 jekson ne apni pustak ‘europe cins di war’ main thik hi likhaa he- ”spainvaasiyon ke itihaas main yah pehla avasar he jabaki railen samay par chali hai
 Trade and industry have prospered under the dictatorship
 krishi faliphuli he
 Labor crises have gone away
 “ Some scholars consider the Adhinayakatantra to be human-friendly
 iske paksh main unka kahana he ki manushya main swabhaavatah apane hiton kii raksha kii ichha avashya hoti he
 He wants his protection whether it is done by anyone
 apni samasyaon kaa samaadhaan chahta he
 Does it not matter to the general public that his defense system is powerful? She wants security, wants her interests fulfilled
 adhinayakatantr main aisa sambhav hone ke kaaran yah maanav swabhaav ke anukool vyavastha bhi maani jaati he
 The dictatorship has also been considered useful for developing states in transitional conditions of political and economic development
 vikasshil rajyon main janaichha kii anushaasit abhivyakti kii samasya atyant prabal rahi he
 In an effort to cross various stages of development, budding nations awaken to the people's aspirations, but the faster the public aspirations, the faster they are not able to fulfill them
 iske kaaran rajya vyavastha par tanaav badhate hai evam uske tuutane kaa dar rahata he
 In such a situation the dictatorship may be more useful for maintaining political discipline
 hanitagton ne thik hi kaha he ki ‘navdith raashton main pratham kaary raajnneetik sahbhaag, shiksha aadi kii vruddhi ke sthaan par moolbhoot, sansthaatmak dhaanche kaa nirmaan hona chahie tathaa iske liye ekadaleey shashan yaa sainik adhinayakatantr bhi upyukt ho saktaa he
 ' adhinayakatantr main gunon ke hote hue bhi is pranali kaa kisi bhi desh main lambi avadhi tak prachlan nahin rah paata he
 History is replete with such evidence that wherever the dictatorship is established, there is a situation when the public does not hesitate to resort to a violent revolution to overthrow the supreme ruler in power
 isse spasht he ki is vyavastha main kuch kamiyaan avashya pai jaati hai
 In short, the defects of this system are as follows- is vyavastha main vyakti ke vyaktitv kaa sammaan nahin hone ke kaaran vyakti ko sab kuch suvidhaayen hote hue bhi use apane vyaktitv ko apni icchaanusaar viksit karne kaa vaataavaran nahin mil paata he tathaa vah apane jivan ko apurna hi rakhane par majaboor ho jaataa he
 The person does not have freedom in any way
 isse uskaa vyaktitv dabakar rah jaataa he
 Fundamental rights and personal liberty are not given any importance in the dictatorship system
 atah taanaashaahee vyavastha kaa sabase bada durgun vyakti ke vyaktitv ke daman kaa vaataavaran bananaa he
 Atrocity and incest is dominated by the dictatorship regime
 adhinaayak apni satta ko bana rakhane ke li aatank failaa rakhata he
 Opponents are eliminated by barbaric methods
 isse maanav bhaygrast hokar jail ke sikhchon main band sa ho jaataa he
 If anything said in the interest of the country is contrary to the dictator's will, he is turned down and the person who speaks against him is called a traitor
 taanaashaahee vyavastha desh ke liye ahitkar hoti he
 In this arrangement the decision is taken by a person who does not accept any kind of protest or suggestion
 isse taanashaah dwaara liye gayi galat nirnyon kaa ahitkar prabhaav sari praja ko bhugatna padataa he
 Every directive of the Adhinayak has to be accepted by the people, whether it is in the national interest or not
 is prr car taanaashaahee vyavastha main rashtiy hiton kaa samuchit sangrakshan nahin rahata he
 In the Adhinayaktantra, the sense of self-reliance, action and freedom is completely lost in ordinary people, because they have no freedom to speak or think, etc
 is vyavastha main vyakti kaa tan, dhan or yahaan tak ki man bhi adhinaayak ke liye ho jaataa he or use adhinaayak jidhar hankey udhar hi chalane ke liye majaboor hona padataa he
 It is clear from the discussion of the merits and demerits of the Adhinayaktantra that this system does not make man a human being and does not even allow him to live as a human being
 isamen maanav kaa vyaktitv dabakar rah jaataa he
 Even after fulfilling all his material needs, he feels something lacking
 uskaa jivan kaidi kaa sa ho jaataa he
 That is why despite many benefits of Adhinayaktantra, a person does not like to live under this system
 is shashan main vyakti ke liye sab kuch rahata he parantu phir bhi usko aisi vyavastha main ghutan hone lagati he, kyonki vyakti keval roti ke liye hi jivit nahi rahata he
 Apart from this, he wants to achieve and do a lot of things which are possible only in the atmosphere of freedom of thought and expression
 atah adhinayakatantr sabhi aakarshanon ke baavjood bhi tanaav mastishk kii bhukh mitaane ke sadhano par roak lagane vaala hone ke kaaran jan saadhaaran dwaara amaanya hi rahata he
 After thinking about the merits and demerits of this regime, it becomes easy to indicate about its future

 In the common language, if one imagines that the Earth is surrounded by an imaginary circle and the sun is a light located on it, then if someone makes a hypothetical point every year for the year at noon, the sun is located on the celestial sphere
 And then add these 365 points and extend that line on both sides and move towards the horizon, then it will get eclipse
