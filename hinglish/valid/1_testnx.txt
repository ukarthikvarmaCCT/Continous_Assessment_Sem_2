 iske baad ishadhinium main 1991 tathaa 1993 main sanshodhan kiye gaye
 a comprehensive amendment was introduced in December 2002 to make the Consumer Protection Act more functional and purposeful and came into force from 15 March 2003
 parinamswaroop upabhokta sangrakshan niyam, 1987 main bhi sanshodhan kiya gaya or 5 march 2004 ko adhishuchet kiya gaya tha
 The Government of India has declared 24 December as National Consumer Day, as the President of India adopted the Act of the Historical Consumer Protection Act, 1986 on the same day
 iske atirikt 15 march ko prayek varsh vishwa upabhokta adhikaar diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa hai
 This day has been written in golden letters in the history of the Indian Customer Movement
 bharat main yah diwas pehali baar varsh 2000 main manaaya gaya
 And it is celebrated every year even further

 When the customer retaliated against the injustice, the seller started accusing the customer of looting
 is paristhiti se ubarne ke liye graahak panchayat ne graahak sangrakshan ke liye swatantra kanoon kii aavashyaktaa pratipaadit kii
 In 1977, the workers of the Customer Panchayat in Lonavala passed a resolution in the meeting demanding such legislation
 1978 main graahak panchayat ne ek maang patr prakashit kiya
 These demands were made in the Customer Protection Act, Ministry of Customers and Customer Office
 panchayat ne swayan is par kanoon kaa praaroop taiyaar karke 1980 main kanoon kaa masauda taiyaar karnaa prarambh kiya
 At the first meeting of the Law Committee on 9 April 1980, the draft law was placed before the committee

 a year after taking over the reins of governance, Rao Jodha began to feel that the fort of Mandore was unsafe
 unhone apane tatkaaleen kile se 9 kilometre dur ek pahari par nayaa kila banane kaa vichaar prastut kiya
 This hill was known as Bhor Chidiya, because there used to be a lot of birds

 a railroad engineer, locomotive engineer, train operator, train driver or engine driver is a person who drives a train on a railroad
 ejeeniyar locomotive ke saath train ke yantric aaparishan, train kii gati or sabhi trainon ke prabandhan or prabhaar ke liye jimmedaar hote hai
 On many American railroads, career progression begins as an assistant, conductor and eventually engineer
 sanyukt rajya america main ejiniya ko har 2-3 saal par pramanit or punahpramanit kiya janaa aavashyak he
 In India, an engine driver has to start as a diesel assistant or electric assistant
 uske baad unki padonnati : bi, e or e special ke str par hoti he
 'A Special' level drivers drive faster and more important trains
 sanyukt rajya america, canada, or newjiland main train driver "locomotive ejeeniyar" ke rup main jane jate hai
 In Britain, South Africa, and Australia, they are known as "train drivers", "engine drivers", "locomotive drivers" or "locomotive operators"
 ek ejeeniyar, sarvice ke liye upkaran kii taiyaari, kagaji karrwai kii jaanch or ingine kii haalat ke liye jimmedaar hote hai
 Their duties require acceleration, braking and control of the train from inside
 unhen railmarg kii bhautik visheshtaon kii, yatri steshnon kii, sahi raste or gati seemaa kii veg or avnati kii jaankaree honi chahie
 conductor ke saath-saath, ejeeniyar ko samay kii nigaraanee kerani hoti he taaki nishchit samay se peeche nahin chalem or na hi stesan ko jaldi choden
 jab bhi kisi train ke peeche ja rahe hon, maarg parivartan kar rahe hon yaa bahut jaldi pahunchane se bachane ke samay viniman kar rahe hon to train kii gati ko kam rakhana chahie
 agar conductor aksham he to ejeeniyar ko conductor ke kartavyon kii jaankaree honi chahie
 The locomotive engineer is required to have intimate knowledge of the signal placement including the track ground so that the vehicle can be safely controlled
 is bhoomika main ekaagratha ko banaae rakhana bahut hi mahatvapurn he
 The kinetics of the train can be extreme, so the engineer needs to be trained in the train handling technique so as to avoid train splitting and deceleration and the speed of the train line does not exceed
 aam taur par yatri gadiyon kii tulana main maal gadiyon kii shakti alag hoti he
 a special freight train may carry 500 tonnes of front locomotive
 uske peeche 1500m kii vaigne hoti hai
 Wagons may not load the goods uniformly and have different brakes
 ek train ke vibhaajan ke liye baari brake anuprayogon ko in karkon ke saath jod ja saktaa he
 Therefore it is generally good practice to practice the operation of goods trains for transportation
 brake kaa nirmaan karte samay iske gathan kii shakti ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi ise praapt kiya jaataa he or locomotive brake ko prayog karne se pehle iskaa takneekee vikaas kiya jaataa he
 It is not possible to do this using dynamic brakes when the train's own operational challenges are present
 jab bahu locomotive hon to kuch brake taiyaar karne ke liye locomotive ke bajaay vaiganon se kaam liya ja saktaa he, kyonki atyadhik locomotive ke prayog se train ke saamne kaa bhaag baaki anuprayog se bahut baari ho jaataa he 
 On smaller passenger trains, this is even more noticeable, requiring the application of the brake to develop technology on the locomotive
 anuprayog main vruddhi ke saath baad main locomotive brake lagaae jate he
 The length of the slowing or stopping distance dictates how many locomotive brake applications should be allowed
 dynamik brake ke upyog se ati mand karrwai ho sakati he, chalane ke dauraan isaki sambhaavna bahut adhik hoti he agar anupyukt samay main ise laayaa jaae or agar anupyukt samay main anuchit upyog karne se ran out bhi ho saktaa he, donon sambhawatah train ke dragiyar ko kaat sakate hai
 The straight line is the only reason that leads to deceleration, thus reducing the possible occurrence of the train by paying attention to the technique of handling
 jab ek train gol buniyadi bhautikee par gumti he tab wagon ghaseetati hui chote raste par chalati he or pahie kaa ubhara hua kinaaraa hone vaali ghatana ko rokane ke asafal ho saktaa he jisase avapathan ho saktaa he
 The land of the track is also critical to handle the train
 yah vaanchhneeya he ki khadi grad ke neeche brake ko lagu karne ke bajaae ise rih karnaa chahie or ek khadi grad ke sheersh par ek puri tarah se charge brake pipe vaanchhneeya he
 The serial brake is where the train descends a grade on the air brake alone
 brake pipe anuprayog dhire - dhire dhimaa hota he or agar aavashyak ho to train ko rokane ke liye locomotive compressor punarbharan ke liye brake pipe ko richarge karata he
 In these cases the use of locomotive brakes is allowed to slow the rate of acceleration to catch the train and give more time to recharge the brake pipe so that later train brake application is even better
 When the train is very fast, brake application may be required before the recharge of the train pipe
 jahaan ek train brake anuprayog kiya jaataa he vahaan ek vibhaajan kii kami hoti he or jaise jaise grad neeche jaataa he yah dhire - dhire badhata rahata he
 This is somewhat different from the serial brake in which the serial brake application is released, the brake pipe is reconditioned after recharging
 jab upyogi twaran kii dar ko dhimaa kar detii he tab train brake pipe ko anumati detaa he ki ise punah richarge kar lagu kar sake
 
 jab ek train dynamik brake or hawa brake donon prakriyaaon kaa upyog karti he to ise grad 'mentaning braking' kehete hai
 With a heavy grade along with the speed limit) when the valid speed of a train is so low that there is no dynamic brake that should be in it
 malgadee marshaling yard main wagon ko takneekee rup se viksit kiya jaataa he taaki ve aasaani se ghumaae ja saken
 haalanki jab ek locomotive bina brake ke kai vaiganon ko ekasaath ghumaate hai to puri train ke liye locomotive brake hona chahie
 maal or rolling stock kaa nuksaan sambhav he
 In addition, the wagon is expected to be very fast with no brakes
 patrakarita main ghatnaon kaa likhit rup main varnan karne ke liye bahut si shaileyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jinhen "patrakarita sheliyaan" kehete hai
 Newspapers and periodicals often publish thoughtful articles written by expert journalists called "feature stories"
 feechar lekh zyaadaatar lambe prakaar ke lekh hote he jahaan sidhe samachar soochna se adhik style par dhyaan diya jaataa he
 Most articles are combined with photographs, drawings or other types of "art"
 kabhi-kabhi ye mudran prabhaav yaa rango se bhi prakashit kiye jate he
 The interrelations of marketism and journalism have also influenced the style of journalism
 ek patrkaar ke liye roopak kii likhaai anya sidhe samachar soochna kii likhaai se kai zyaada shramsadhy ho sakati he
 While on one hand they have the burden of properly collecting and presenting the facts of the story, on the other hand there is pressure to find a creative and interesting way to present the story
 lead pathak kaa dhyaan khinchne or lekh ke vichaaro ko yatharth rup se prakat karne main sakasham hona chahie
 Since the last half of the 20th century, the line between direct news reporting and feature writing has blurred
 patrakaron or prakashnon aaj alag-alag drushtikon ke saath lekhan par prayojan kar rahe hai
 Tom Wolfe, Gay Tales, Hunter S
 Thompson etc
 are some of these examples
 shahari or vaikalpik saptahik samachar patron is vishistataa ko or bhi dhundhala kar rahe hai
 Many magazines have more feature articles than direct news
 kuch television samachar pradarshnon ne vaikalpik swaroopon ke saath prayog kiya, or is vajah se kai television pradarshnon ko patrakarita ke maanakon ke anusaar na hone ke vajah se samachar pradarshan nahin mana gaya

 Celebrity journalism is the genre of journalism that rose to prominence from the 20th century
 ise log patrakarita bhi kaahaa jaataa he
 It focuses on the personal lives of people, mainly celebrities, film and theater actors, music artists, models and photographers, other notable people in entertainment industry and politicians who want to be in the news
 akhbaar gapshap stanbhakaar or gapshap patrakaao ke praant baar,celibrity patrakarita, rashtriya enquaire tarah rashtriya akhbaar samachar patro kaa dhyaan kendrit ho gaya he
 Patracao such as People and US Weekly, syndicated television dramas such as entertainmenttunite, insideadison, The Insider, Access Hollywood, and additional cable networks such as E, A&E Network and Biography Channel and thousands of TV shows from thousands of websites
 adhikansh anya samachar media hastiyo or logo main se kuch kawarej pradaan karte he
 In recent years, the media has reported to various royal family members in the same way as reports on celebrities, although not always the same as actors or leaders
 roylty kaa samachar kawarej shahi pariwaro ke sadasyo ke jivan kii jhalak par adhik kendrit kiya gaya
 Sources say that there are reports on royalty such as The Telegraph, The Daily Mail and publications that report on royalty in particular, such as Royal Central
 celibrity patrakarita, feechar lekhan se alag he, isame un logo par kendrit karata he jo pehle se hi mashhoor he yaa vishesh rup se aakarshak he or zyaadaatar un peedhee hastiyo ko shaamil karte he jo aniatik vyavhaar kaa upyog karne main aksar kawarej pradaan karte he
 Paparazzi constantly follow celebrities who have come to photograph photographers, celebrity journalism, to get potentially embarrassing pictures

 New Journalism: The writing method of the 1960s and 1970s has been called New Journalism
 tom volfe ne iska namkaran kiya tha 1973 me
 There are many ways, such as Sahityaak Shishishan, Aapsi Bath Chith, the splitting of your kud and every day that everyone knows, or to make people a khaniya, to make people known as their own, here are all the best of journalism
 shuru main ye thoda avyaarik lagta he par nai patrakarita reporting ke saare niyamo kaa paln karthe huai sahi jankari detha he or lekak hamaare pramukiya jankark hothe he
 Kurdish reporters going to Bath have different types of arms like how they feel, what they are feeling, etc
 apne naii soch ke corn nai patrakarita har chhiz ko apne andar samethe hue purani niyamo ko thodthe hue aage badtha he or is tarah ki patrakarita ko hm lekhan, yaa kitaab lekhan ke isthamal karthe he
 Wolfe believes that there is a writer whose work has been considered in new journalism, such as Norman Miler, Hünter sa Thompson, Joan Didion, Truman Chapote, Giorgé Plimpton and Guy Talesay vigyaan patrakaron ko vistrut, takneekee or kabhi kabhi shadjaal se ladi jaanakri ko dilachasp report main badalakar samachar media ke upbhogataaon kii samaj ke aadhaar par prastut karnaa hota he
 Scientific journalists have to decide which scientific developments have the potential to be detailed
 saath hi vaigyanik samudaay ke bheetar hone vaale vivaadon ko bina pakshpaat kiye or tathyon ke saath pesh karnaa chahie
 Science journalism has been criticized for exaggerating the inner views of the scientific community on topics such as global warming

 Metabolism is the chemical reactions that occur in living organisms
 ye prakriyaayein jeevon ko badhane or prajnan karne, apni rachana ko banaae rakhane or unke paryaavaran ke prati sajag rahane main madad karti hai
 Metabolism is generally divided into two types
 apachay carbonic padaarthon kaa vighatan karata he, udaa
 koshikeey shwasan se urja kaa utpaadan
 upachay urja kaa prayog karke proteinon or nabhikeey amlon jaise koshikaon ke anshon kaa nirmaan karata he
 Chemical reactions of metabolism operate in metabolic pathways, in which one chemical is converted to another chemical in a few steps by a series of enzymes
 anzime chayapachay ke liye mahatvapurn hote hai, kyonki ve jeevon ko aisi apekshit pratikriyaayein, jinamein urja kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or jo swatah nahin ghat sakati hai, unhen un swatah hone vaali pratikriyaaon ke saath yugal rup main hone main madad karte hai, jinase urja utpann hoti he
 Since enzymes act as catalysts, they allow these reactions to take place rapidly and reasonably
 anzime koshika ke paryaavaran main parivartanon yaa anya koshikaon se praapt sanketon ke anusaar chayapachayee margon ke niyantran main bhi sahaayta karte hai
 The metabolism of an organism determines which substance will be nutritious for it and which is toxic
 For example, some prokaryotes use hydrogen sulfide, while this gas is toxic to animals
 chayapachay kii gati, yaa chayapachay dar is baat ko bhi prabhavit karti he ki kisi jeev ko kitne bhojan kii jarurat hogi
 a special feature of metabolism is that even if there are large differences in the species, their basic metabolic pathways and fractions are the same
 udaa
 citric acid chakra main madhyamik bhoomika nibhaane vaale carbaxylic acid, eckoshikeey bacteria eshcharishia coli se lekar haathiyon jaise vishaal bahukoshikeey jeevon tak, sabhi main paae jate hai
 These distinct metabolic similarities are probably due to the high efficiency of these pathways and their early appearance in developmental history
 jaanwaron, paudhon or sookshmjivon ko banane vaali adhikansh rachanaaen anuon ke teen mul virgon se bani hoti hai-amino acid, carbohydrate or lipid 
 chunki ye anu jivan ke liye mahatvapurn hote hai, isaliye chayapachayee pratikriyaayein koshikaon or utakon ke nirmaan ke samay in anuon ko banane, yaa bhojan ke pachan or prayog main unhen vighatit karne va unhen urja ke strot ke rup main upyog main laane main juty hoti hai
 Many important biochemicals combine to produce polymers such as DNA and proteins
 ye mahounu atyaavashyak hote hai
 Proteins are made up of amino acids arranged in linear chains and added by peptide bonds
 kai protein chayapachay main rasaynic pratikriyaaon ko utprerit karne vaale anzime hote hai
 The function of other proteins is constructive or procedural, such as the cell forming a claw - the structure to maintain cell shape - forming proteins
 Proteins are also important in cell signaling, immunity, adhesion of cells, active transport across membranes, and the cell cycle
 vasa padaarth jaevrasyanon ke sabase adhik vividhta vaale samooh hai
 Their main creative use is as part of biological membranes such as cell membranes, or as a source of energy
 vasaaon ko saamanytah hydrophobic yaa amphypathic jaivik anuon ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he, jo benzin yaa chlorofarm jaise vilaayakon main ghulansheel hote hai
 Fats are a large compound group consisting of fatty acids and glycerol - a glycerol molecule associated with three fatty acid esters is called thylylglyceride
 is mul rachana ke kai vibhinn prakaar paae jate hai, jinamein sphingolipidon main sphingosin or hydrophyli samooh jaise phospholipidon main phosphate shaamil hai
 Steroids, such as cholesterol, are another major class of fats formed in cells
 carbohydrate anek hydraxil samoohon vaale sidhi shrankhla ke eldihide yaa kitone hote hai, jo sidhi shrankhla yaa chhallon ke rup main rah sakate hai
 Carbohydrates are the most commonly found organic molecules and play many roles, such as the accumulation and transport of energy and the creative parts
 The basic carbohydrate units are called monosaccharides, which include galactose, fructose, and most importantly, glucose
 monosacride aapas main judakar lagbhag aseemit rup se policecridon kaa nirmaan kar sakate hai
 DNA and RNA polymers are long chains of nucleotides
 ye anu pratilipikaran or protein jaivasanshleshan kii prakriyaaon ke jariye jin-sambandhi jaankaree ke sanchayan or prayog ke liye aavashyak hote hai
 This information is protected by DNA repair processes and transmitted by DNA replication
 kuch viruson jaise echivi main arene jinom hota he, jo ulte pratilipikaran kaa prayog karke apane viral arene jinom se diene saanche kaa nirmaan karata he
 The RNA of ribozyme such as spliceosomes and ribosomes is similar to that of enzymes as it can catalyze chemical reactions
 newcliosida riboj sugar se nabhikeey aadhaaron ke judane se banate hai
 These bases are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic rings, classified into purines or pyrimidines
 newcliotide chayapachayee samooh antaran pratikriyaaon main sahaenzimon kaa kaam bhi karte hai
 Metabolism involves a large number of chemical reactions, but most of them are a few basic types of reactions that occur for the transfer of working groups
 is aam rasayanakriya ke kaaran koshikaaye vibhinn pratikriyaaon ke bich rasaynic samoohon kaa vahan karne ke liye chayapachayee madhyasthon ke chote se samooh kaa istemaal karti hai
 These group-transfer intermediaries are called coenzymes
 samooh-antaran kii prayek kaksha ek vishesh sahaenzime dwaara kii jaati he, jo use utpann karne vaale or uskaa upyog karne vaale anzimon ke set kaa sabstrate hota he
 That is why these coenzymes are constantly being made, used and repeated again
 ek kendriya sahaenzime he, adinosin tryphosphate, jo koshikaon kii sarvyaapee urja mudra he
 This nucleotide is used to transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions
 koshikaon main atipi choti si maatra main hota he, lekin chunki yah lagaataar banataa rahata he, isaliye maanav sharir din bhar main lagbhag apane bhaar ke baraabar atipi kaa prayog kar saktaa he
 ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism, in which catabolic reactions produce ATP and anabolic reactions use it
 yah phophorilikaran pratikriyaaon main phosphate samoohon ke vaahak ke rup main bhi kaary karata he
 Vitamin is an organic compound required in small amounts, which cannot be made by cells
 In human nutrition, most vitamins act as coenzymes after modification, e
g
 all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated at the time of use in cells or are coupled to nucleotides

 The closed gear is one of the most prominent gear outlines
 is tarah kii gear main gear ke daant ek vrutt kii bahari taraf lage hote hai
 To understand closed gear, we need to think of two circles, which are not touching each other
 ab ham un donon kii sparsharekha banaate hai
 In this way we will be able to find two tangents
 ab hamen ek vrutt ko ghumana he
 Imagine that the left gear is rotating clockwise
 is tarah se ham ek sparsh rekha ko hataa sakenge
 The closed gear operates in this way
 ek gear dusre gear ko dhakka detaa he, to wo dhakka hameshaa isi sparsh rekha kii disha main hota he
 In real gear, these circles have teeth on them, due to which they are able to touch each other and move around together
 ab hamen kuch takneekee shabd samajhane padenge : Vocal circle: We will connect the centers of our circles with a straight line
 hamen ek bindu aisi milegi, jahaan par ye rekha sparsharekha ko kaat rahi he
 This point is called the vowel point
 ham ek centre par prakaar kii nok rakhkar swar bindu tak kii trigya kaa vrutt banaaenge
 When we do this with the second center, we get two vowel circles
 is swar vrutt kii sahaayta se ham apane gear kii koniya gati kaa anumaan laga lenge
 Since both circles have the same speed at the vowel point kha kii trigya * kha kii koniya gati = k kii trigya * k kii koniya gati Angular speed of b / angular speed of a = radius of a / radius of b sparsh rekha or gear kendron ko jodne vaali rekha kii lamb ek rekha ke bich jo kone banataa he, use dabaav kone kehete hai

 bold darshit karata he:- daavedaar kaa purna niyantran; italics darshata he, daavedaar kaa aanshik niyantran
 580px | thumb | Territorial disputes in Europe The wikt:antarctic Treaty System, formed on wikt:1 December wikt:1959 and entered into force on wikt:23 June wikt:1961, establishes the legal framework for the management of wikt:antarctica and provides administration for the continent, which is carried out through consultative member meetings
 It freezes the territorial claims of all signatories for as long as the treaty is in force
 However, it is not a final settlement; parties can choose to withdraw from the System at any time
 Furthermore, only a minority of states have signed it, and it is not formally sanctioned by the wikt:united Nations
 Thus, Antarctica remains the only part of the planet any state can still lay claim to as wikt:terra nullius 
 When the wikt: Constitution of the Republic of China was adopted on wikt: 25 December wikt: 1947, the wikt: Republic of China did recognize the statehood of the wikt: Mongolian People's Republic with Soviet pressure
 After the wikt: UN General Assembly Resolution 505 was passed in 1952, the Republic of China withdrew such a recognition in 1953 and therefore claimed wikt: Greater Mongolia including wikt: Outer Mongolia
 On wikt:26 November wikt:1993, the wikt:judicial Yuan of the Republic of China in its Interpretation 328 called the constitutional territory beyond the reach of judicial review and thus avoided the question as whether Mongolia should be considered the constitutional territory of the Republic of China
 The Republic of China has once again recognized the statehood of wikt: Mongolia in 2002, thus freezing the territorial claim, but as the Constitution of the Republic of China still mentions Mongolia in Article 119 that has not been superseded by the Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China, there are different opinions as to whether such a recognition is constitutional
 Despite these, the Yearbook of the Republic of China 2003 Version published by the wikt: Government Information Office does claim Outer Mongolia
 thumb|map of the Republic of China with various territorial disputes Over 1
5% of the world's population live in an area disputed by two countries that are members of the wikt: United Nations
 This rises to around 25% when the areas and regions where territorial claims are made by two or more parties that do not recognize each other is included, although much of this comes from the wikt: Republic of China's claim to wikt: mainland China

 is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Gross domestic product ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 Gross domestic product or GDP or GDP is a basic measure of the economic performance of an economy, the market value of all final goods and services within a nation's range in a year
 GDP ko teen prakaar se paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he, jinamein se sabhi avadharanatmak rup se samaan hai
 First, it is equal to the total expenditure incurred for all final goods and services produced within a country in a given time period
 doosraa, yah ek desh ke bheetar ek avadhi main sabhi udyogon ke dwaara utpaadan kii prayek avasthaa par kul vardhit mulya or utpaadon par sabsidi rahit kar ke yoga ke baraabar he
 Third, it is equal to the sum of the income generated by production in the country over a period — that is, the amount of workers' compensation, taxes on production and subsidized imports and gross operating surplus
 GDP ke maapan or maatr nirdhaaran kaa sabase aam tarika he kharch yaa vyay vidhi : "gross" means the depreciation of capital share has not been subtracted from GDP
 yadi shuddh nivesh ko uparyukt sameekaran main sakal nivesh ke sthaan par lagaaya jaae, to shuddh gharelu utpaada kaa sutara praapt hota he
 Consumption and investment in this equation are expenditure on final goods and services

 ek ghar ke dwaara nae awaas par vyay karnaa bhi nivesh main shaamil hai
 Contrary to its colloquial meaning, 'investment' in GDP does not mean the purchase of financial products
 vittiya utpaadon ke kray ko 'bachat' ke rup main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, nivesh ke rup main nahin
 The distinction is clear: if money is converted into goods or services, it is investment; But, if you buy a bond or a share of a stock, this transfer payment is set aside from GDP
 to stock or band paroksh rup se GDP ko prabhavit karte hai
 Although such purchases are commonly called investments, from a total economic point of view it is simply an exchange of contracts and not a part of actual production or GDP
 isamen koi hastantaran bhugtan jaise saamaajik suraksha yaa berogari ke laabh shaamil nahin hai
 Examples of C, I, g and NX: If you spend money to renovate your hotel, so that rates of occupancy increase, it is a private investment, but if you buy shares in a consortium to do the same It is a saving
 GDP ke maapan ke dauraan pehle vaala kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, baad vaale kaa nahin
 But, when the union makes its own spending on renewal, this expenditure will be included in GDP
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi ek hotel nijee ghar he, tab navinikaran vyay ko upbhog mana jayega, lekin yadi ek sarkari agency hotel ko naagarik sevaao ke ek karyaalay main badal rahi he, to navinikaran vyay ko saarvjaanik kshetra vyay kaa ek bhaag mana jayega
