 The design of the inductance ensures that the operating point of the transistor is not too high even if the transistor's temperature is changed, the transistor's β is changed or the transistor with a slightly different β, or the DC supply voltage changes slightly

 With reference to this picture- atah, For a given transistor, Vbe does not vary significantly during use
 As Vcc is of fixed value, on selection of Rb, the base current Ib is fixed
 Therefore, this type is called fixed bias type of circuit
 Also for given circuit, Therefore, The common-emitter current gain of a transistor is an important parameter in circuit design, and is specified on the data sheet for a particular transistor
 It is denoted as β on this page
 Therefore we can obtain Ic as well
 In this manner, operating point given as can be set for given transistor
 Benefit: alaabh: Use: Due to the above inherent drawbacks, fixed bias is rarely used in linear circuits 
 Instead, it is often used in circuits where transistor is used as a switch
 However, one application of fixed bias is to achieve crude automatic gain control in the transistor by feeding the base resistor from a DC signal derived from the AC output of a later stage
 This configuration employs negative feedback to prevent thermal runaway and stabilize the operating point
 In this form of biasing, the base resistor r b { \ displaystyle r _ { \ text {b}}} is connected to the collector instead of connecting it to the DC source v cc { \ displaystyle v _ { \ text {cc}}} 
 So any thermal runaway will induce a voltage drop across the RC { \ displaystyle r _ { \ text {C}}} resistor that will throttle the transistor's base current
 From Kirchhoff's voltage law, the voltage v r b { \ displaystyle V_{{ \ text{r}}_{ \ text{b xxrep 4 } across the base resistor r b { \ displaystyle R_{ \ text{b}}} is By the Ebers – Moll model, i c = β i b { \ displaystyle i _ { \ text {c}} = \ beta i _ { \ text {b}}}, and so From Ohm's law, the base current i b = v r b / r b { \ displaystyle I_{ \ text{b}}=v_{{ \ text{r}}_{ \ text{b}}} / R_{ \ text{b}}}, and so Hence, the base current i b { \ displaystyle i _ { \ text {b}}} is If v be { \ displaystyle V_{ \ text{be}}} is held constant and temperature increases, then the collector current i c { \ displaystyle I_{ \ text{c}}} increases
 However, a larger i c { \ displaystyle I_{ \ text{c}}} causes the voltage drop across resistor r c { \ displaystyle R_{ \ text{c}}} to increase, which in turn reduces the voltage v r b { \ displaystyle V_{{ \ text{r}}_{ \ text{b xxrep 4 } across the base resistor r b { \ displaystyle R_{ \ text{b}}} 
 a lower base-resistor voltage drop reduces the base current i b { \ displaystyle I_{ \ text{b}}}, which results in less collector current i c { \ displaystyle I_{ \ text{c}}} 
 Because an increase in collector current with temperature is opposed, the operating point is kept stable
 Benefit: alaabh: which is the case when upyog:the negative feedback also increases the input impedance of the amplifier as seen from the base, which can be advantageous
due to the gain reduction from feedback, this biasing form is used only when the trade-off for stability is warranted
 The fixed bias circuit is modified by attaching an external resistor to the emitter
 This resistor introduces negative feedback that stabilizes the Q-point
 From Kirchhoff's voltage law, the voltage across the base resistor is From Ohm's law, the base current is The way feedback controls the bias point is as follows
 If Vbe is held constant and temperature increases, emitter current increases
 However, a larger Ie increases the emitter voltage Ve = iere, which in turn reduces the voltage vrb across the base resistor
 a lower base-resistor voltage drop reduces the base current, which results in less collector current because Ic = β Ib
 Collector current and emitter current are related by Ic = α Ie with α ≈ 1, so the increase in emitter current with temperature is opposed, and the operating point is kept stable
 Similarly, if the transistor is replaced by another, there may be a change in Ic 
 By similar process as above, the change is negated and operating point kept stable
 For the given circuit, Advantages: The circuit has the tendency to stabilize operating point against changes in temperature and β-value
 Disadvantages: which is approximately the case if upyog: The feedback also increases the input impedance of the amplifier when seen from the base, which can be advantageous
 Due to the above disadvantages, this type of biasing circuit is used only with careful consideration of the trade-offs involved
 collector-stabilized Biasing The voltage divider is formed using external resistors R1 and R2
 The voltage across R2 forward biases the emitter junction
 By proper selection of resistors R1 and R2, the operating point of the transistor can be made independent of β
 In this circuit, the voltage divider holds the base voltage fixed independent of base current provided the divider current is larger than the base current
 However, even with a fixed base voltage, the collector current varies with temperature so an emitter resistor is added to stabilize the Q-point, similar to the above circuits with emitter resistor
 The voltage divider configuration achieves the correct voltages by the use of resistors in certain patterns
 By manipulating the resistors in certain ways you can achieve more stable current levels without having β value affect it too much
 In this circuit the base voltage is given by: VB = { \ displaystyle V_ {B} = \ } voltage across r 2 { \ displaystyle R_ {2} \ } = v cc r 2 - i b r 1 r 2 { \ displaystyle = V_ {cc} { \ frac {R_ {2}} {}} - I_ {b} { \ frac {R_ {1} R_ {2}} {}}} Also v b = v b e + i e r e { \ displaystyle v_{b}=v_{be}+i_{e}r_{e} \ } For the given circuit, laabh: Advantage: which is approximately the case if where R1 || R2 denotes the equivalent resistance of R1 and R2 connected in parallel
 upyog: The circuit's stability and merits as above make it widely used for linear circuits
 The standard voltage divider circuit discussed above faces a drawback – AC feedback caused by resistor RE reduces the gain
 This can be avoided by placing a capacitor in parallel with Re, as shown in circuit diagram
 The result is that the DC operating point is well controlled, while the ac-gain is much higher, rather than the much lower value of r c / r e { \ displaystyle R_{ \ text{c}} / R_{ \ text{e}}} without the capacitor
 When a split supply is available, this biasing circuit is the most effective, and provides zero bias voltage at the emitter or collector for load
 The negative supply Vee is used to forward-bias the emitter junction through Re
 The positive supply Vcc is used to reverse-bias the collector junction
 Only two resistors are necessary for the common collector stage and four resistors for the common emitter or common base stage
 We know that, Vb - Ve = Vbe If Rb is small enough, base voltage will be approximately zero
 Therefore, emitter current is, Ie = / Re The operating point is independent of β if Re >> Rb / β Advantages: Disadvantages: This type can only be used when a split power supply is available
 Class b and AB amplifiers employ 2 active devices to cover the complete 360 deg of input signal flow
 Each transistor is therefore biased to perform over approximately 180 deg of the input signal
 Class b bias is when the collector current Ic with no signal is just conducting 
 class-ab bias is when the collector current Ic is about 1 / 4 of maximum possible value
the class-ab push–pull output amplifier circuit below could be the basis for a moderate-power audio amplifier
 Q3 is a common emitter stage that provides amplification of the signal and the DC bias current through D1 and D2 to generate a bias voltage for the output devices
 The output pair are arranged in class-ab push – pull, also called a complementary pair
 The diodes D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized
 That is, the diodes push the output stage into class-ab mode
 This design automatically stabilizes its operating point, since overall feedback internally operates from DC up through the audio range and beyond
 The use of fixed diode bias requires the diodes to be both electrically and thermally matched to the output transistors
 If the output transistors conduct too much, they can easily overheat and destroy themselves, as the full current from the power supply is not limited at this stage
 a common solution to help stabilize the output device operating point is to include some emitter resistors, typically an ohm or so
 Calculating the values of the circuit's resistors and capacitors is done based on the components employed and the intended use of the amplifier

 Digital signals can be of many types, but binary digital signals are most commonly used
 shunya / ek, on / of, haan / nahin, lo / hai aadi binary sanketon ke kuch udhaaharan hai
 Digital electronic has become very important ever since integrated circuits have emerged and millions of electronic devices are being loaded into a small chip
 aadhunik vyaktigat computer tathaa cell-phone, digital camera aadi digital electronic kii dein hai
 Numerical electronics, or microtubule numerical method, is a system that represents electrical signals as a series of separate strips, rather than as a continuous band of linear levels
 is pattee ke sabhi str sanketon kii ek hi avasthaa ko darshaate hai
 Because of this separation of signs, relatively small changes in the level of linear signal due to the construction tolerance do not leave a separate cover
 jiske parinaam swarup sanketo kii avasthaa ko mahasoos karne vaala paripath inhe nazarandaaj kar detaa he
 In most cases the number of signal states is two and these two states are represented by two voltage levels: one and the other depending on the supply voltage in use
 1 is at high level and 0 is at low level
 aksar ye donon str "lo" or "hai" ke rup main pratinidhitiv karte hai
 The basic advantage of the numerical technique is based on the fact that instead of reproducing a continuous series of signals, it is easier to send the electronic device to a known state of signals such as 0 or 1
 digital electronics aam taur par logic gates ke vrihad sangyojan va bulian tark prakaarya ke saral electronix se banaaya jaataa he
 One of the advantages of using a numerical circuit compared to a linear circuit is that signals are not disrupted due to noise and can be easily sent and displayed

 One hour of music in a CD can be stored as about 60 million binary digits
 ek digital pranali main, ek adhik sateek sanket ke pratinidhitiv ke liye adhik binary ankon kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 However, this process requires more numerical circuits, since each digit is handled by the same type of hardware as a result, creating an easier scalable system

 Most digital engineers are careful in selecting computer programs with a compatible file format
 prativedan ke liye ejeeniyar digital system ke prakaaron par vichaar karte hai
 Most digital systems are divided into "combinatorial systems" and "sequential systems"
 sangyojan pranali main hameshaa jo input diya jaataa he vahi output vah detaa he
 It basically represents the set of logic processes and which has already been discussed
 anukramik pranali input ke rup main daale gaye output ke saath ek sangyojan pranali he
 This allows the digital machine to operate operationally
 sabase saral anukramik pranali shaayad ek flip flop he, ek yantrawali jo ki ek binary ank yaa "bit" kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Sequential systems are often designed as state machines

 The sequential system is further divided into two subcategories
 jab ek "clock" signal state ko parivartit karata he tab "tulykaalik" anukramik pranali ek hi baar main state ko badal detaa he
 "asynchronous" transmits a sequential system change whenever inputs change

 As usual, a synchronous sequential state machine is a practical way to implement by dividing it into a combinational logic and a set of flip flops called a "state register"

 In combination logic, the fastest clock rate is set by most of the time-consuming logic estimations
 state register sirf ek dwiadhari sankhya kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 If there are too many states in the state machine, the logic process is some combination logic that produces a number of states
 isaki tulana main atulykaalik system kaa dizin bahut kathin hota he kyonki sabhi sambhav samay main bhi sambhavit state kaa vichaar kiya janaa chahie
 According to the most common method of constructing the minimum and maximum time tables, the state is present in it and the circuit is adjusted to minimize the state and to make the circuit go periodically to the corresponding state of all its parts
 Force it
 Without such careful design, it is easy to produce coincidentally asynchronous logic that is "unstable" and is real electronics that has unpredictable consequences because of small changes in the value of electronic devices due to accumulated delays
 kuch circuit sahaj rup se apane dizin main antarnihit atulykaalik rahe hai or is tarah hi vishleshan kiya janaa chahie
 As of 2005 almost all digital machines are synchronous design because synchronous design is very easy to create and verify - currently the software that mimics digital machines does not handle asynchronous design
 However, asynchronous logic is better understood if it can be worked out, because its speed is not arbitrarily limited by the clock speed, instead, it operates normally at the speed allowed by the logic gates from which they are constructed

 hindi vartanee ke maanakeekaran kii disha main kai diggajon ne apana yogadan diya, jinamein se acharya kishoridas vaajapeyi tathaa acharya ramchandra verma ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Due to the substantial increase in the number of Hindi learners within and outside the country as a result of the acceptance of the official language of the Union of Hindi language and some states, it seemed necessary and time-bound to set the standard system of Hindi spelling, so that more uniformity in the spelling of Hindi words Can be brought tadnusaar, shiksha mantralay, bharat sarkaar ne 1961 main hindi vartanee kii maanak paddati nirdhaarit karne ke liye ek visheshgy samiti niyukt kii

 The committee accordingly submitted its final recommendations in 1962 which were approved by the government and eventually ushered in the official process of standardization of Hindi language
 kendriya hindi nideshaalay ne prathmat: 1968 main “hindi vartanee kaa maanakeekaran” naam se laghu pustika prakashit kii
 In the year 1983, a free revised and enhanced version of this booklet "standardization of Devanagari script and Hindi spelling" was published

, newspapers, magazines etc
 officially adopted this standardization to bring uniformity in the language
 varsh 1968 ke maanakeekaran kaa mukhya aadhaar prayokta or tankan yantra rahaa tha
 In today's era of information, the need was felt to revise and change the standardization of Hindi language and to create computerized Unicode for Devanagari script
 isi taratamya main kendriya hindi nideshaalay dwaara varsh 2003 main devanagari lipi tathaa hindi vartanee ke maanakeekaran ke liye akhil bhartiya sangoshtee kaa aayojan kiya tha
 The rules that were laid down for standard Hindi spelling in this seminar are given below

4 will be the prevailing form of education only
 ise 


 ke rup main nahin likhaa jayega
 The use of either one of the first tr and 


 forms for the combined form of t + r was allowed
 parantu ab iskaa paramparaagat rup tra hi maanak mana jaae
 Other consonants other than sra and tr will be formed as per rules of + R's conjunct 2

 jaise :– kr, pra, br, sr, hr aadi
 2
1

5 The quantity of e will be used immediately before the corresponding consonant, and not before the entire consonant with the second consonant of the conjunct formed from the letter marked with light
 yatha:– kuttim, chitthiyaan, dwitiya, budhimaan, chihnit aadi 
 Note: While quoting the original Sanskrit verses, conjuncts can also be written in the old style
 jaise:– sanyukt, chihn, vidya, vidwaan, vruddh, dwitiya, buddhi aadi
 But if these too are written according to the above rules, then there will be no objection
 2
2
1 hindi ke kaarak chihn sabhi prakaar ke sangya shabdon main pratipadik se pruthak likhe jaaen
 Like: - Ram, Ram, Ram, woman, woman, service etc
 sarvnaam shabdon main ye chihn pratipadik ke saath milakar likhe jaaen

1 Hyphens should be placed between positions in the compound
 jaise :– ram-lakshmana, shiv-parvati samvaad, dekh-rekh, chaal-chalan, hansee-mazaaq, len-dein, padhanaa-likhnaa, khaanaa-pinaa, khelnaa-kudana aadi
 2
4
2 should be placed before hyphen
 jaise :– tum-sa, ram-jaisaa, chaaku-se tikhe
 2
4
3 Hypnosis should be used only in a compound where there is a possibility of confusion without it, otherwise not
 jaise :– bhu-tatv
 Normally, there is no need to apply hyphens in the masculine compound
 jaise :– raamarajy, rajkumaar, gangaajal, gramvasi, aatmahatya aadi
 2
4
3
1 Similarly, if the hyphen is not put in all the words 'a-nikh', reading it as 'ankh' can also mean 'anger'
 a-nati : anati, a-paras : apras, bhu-tatv : bhootatv aadi samast padon kii bhi yahi sthiti he
 All these pairs are different words from both spelling and meanings

 Factors are also identified in front of some latencies
 jaise :– ab se, tab se, yahan se, vahaan se, sadaa se aadi
 According to the rule, invariably should always be written separately
 jaise :– aap hi ke liye, mujh tak ko, aapke saath, gaz bhar kapadaa, desh bhar, raat bhar, din bhar, vah itnaa bhar kar de, mujhe jane to do, kaam bhi nahin bana, pachaas rupye maatr aadi
 2

3 Honorable 'shri' and 'G' Akshay should also be written separately
 jaise shri shriram, kanhaiyalaal ji, mahatma ji aadi 
 2
5
4 All the posts should be written by adding the copy, only, etc
 jaise - pratidin, pratishat, maanavmaatr, nimittamaatr, yathasamay, yathochit aadi
 It is a well-known rule that all posts are considered one if there is no harm
 at use vyast rup main na likhakar ek saath likhnaa hi sangat he
 The phrase 'ten rupees only', 'mere two persons' is composed
 yahan maatr alag se likhaa jaae

 hindi main ye donon arthbhedak bhi hai
 Hence, both Anusvara and resonance mark will be prevalent in Hindi
 2

1 Reminders of Sanskrit words will remain the same before other class characters
 jaise - sanyog, sangrakshan, sanlagn, samvaad, kansa, hinsr aadi
 2
6
1
2 As a combined consonant, if any of the remaining four letters after the fifth letter is used, the reminder should be used for uniformity and convenience of printing / writing
 jaise - pankaj, ganga, chanchal, kanjus, kanth, thanda, sant, sandhya, mandir, sampadak, sambandh aadi 
 The forms kept in bandhani will be valid only in Sanskrit citations
 hindi main bindi kaa prayog karnaa hi uchit hoga
 2

3 If any letter of any other class comes after the Panchamakshar, then the Panchamakhar will not be changed as a reminder
 jaise :– vaanmay, anya, chinmay, unmukh aadi 
 2

1
4 If the fifth Varna comes in divine form, the fifth Varna will not be converted into Anusvara
 jaise - ann, sammelan, sammati aadi 
 2
6
1
5 It would be good to write the nasal consonant in full to remove the confusion of half-letter or anusvara in words accepted from English, Urdu
 jaise :– limka, tankhaah, tinkaa, tamgaa, kamasin aadi
 2
6

6 The use of anusvara at the end of some corresponding Sanskrit words is indicative of M
 jaise - ahan, evam, paran, shivan 
 2

 anunasik swaron ke uccharan main naak se bhi hawa nikalati he
 Like: - Come, come, go, mother, am, come
 2

3 chandrabindu ke bina praaia: arth main bhram kii gunjaaish rahati he
 Such as: - Hans: Laughing, Angana: Angana, Swang: Swang etc
 atev aise bhram ko dur karne ke liye chandrabindu kaa prayog avashya kiya janaa chahie
 But where there is a lot of difficulty in printing etc
 with the use of the lunar point and the use of the point in place of the lunar point does not cause any confusion, there will be a relaxation of the use of the point in place of the lunar point
 jaise :– nahin, main, main aadi
 In the context of poetry etc
, Chandrabindu must be used in the context of verses
 isi prakaar chote bacchon kii praveshikaon main jahaan chandrabindu kaa uccharan abhisht ho, vahaan mote aksharon main uskaa yathasthaan sarvatra prayog kiya jaae
 Such as - Where, laughing, courtyard, grooming, me, I, not etc
 2

1 sanskrit ke jin shabdon main visarg kaa prayog hota he, ve yadi tatsam rup main prayukt hon to visarg kaa prayog avashya kiya jaae
 Such as: - In 'sadness'
 yadi us shabd ke tadbhav rup main visarg kaa lop ho chukaa ho to us rup main visarg ke bina bhi kaam chal jayega
 Such as: - 'partner of sorrow and happiness'
 2

2 tatsam shabdon ke ant main prayukt visarg kaa prayog anivaary he
 As such: - So, again, automatically, often, completely, basically, finally, literally, respectively, etc

 2
7
5 Dispersion should not be used in the words tadbhav / indigenous
 is aadhaar par chah likhnaa galat hoga
 It would be fine to write six
 2
7
6 prayadweep, samaptpraaya aadi shabdon main tatsam rup main bhi visarg nahin he
 2
7
7 Visarga should be written with a letter, while the colon is at some distance from the marked word
 jaise :– atah, yon he :– 2
8
1 should be called light mark and not halant
 vyanjan ke neeche laga hal chihn us vyanjan ke swar rahit hone kii soochna detaa he, yani vah vyanjan vishuddh rup se vyanjan he
 In this way, the word 'jagat' will be called Halant because this word is euphemistic, not a voice
 2
8
2 sanyuktakshar banane ke niyam 2

2
2 ke anusaar d chh t th d dh d h main hal chihn kaa hi prayog hoga

 Such as: -, speech-, satt-, bhagavan-, sakshat-, jagat-, tejas-, vyudit- etc
 tatsam sambodhan main he rajan, he bhagwan rup hi sweekrut honge
 In the Hindi style, o King, o God, be written
 jin shabdon main hal chihn lupt ho chukaa ho, unamem use phir se lagane kaa praytn na kiya jaae
 Such as - great, scholar etc; Because in Hindi, forms like 'mahanati' and 'vidwanas' have become popular
 2

4 vyakaran granthon main vyanjan sandhi samajhaate hue keval utane hi shabd die jaaen, jo shabd rachana ko samajhane ke liye aavashyak hon yaa arth kii drushti se upyogi hon 
 2
8
5 There does not seem to be any need to explain the disjunction of words like Hridayangam, Uddhan, Sanchit etc
 in Hindi
 isi tarah 'saakshaatkaar', 'jagadish', 'shatkosh' jaise shabdon ke arth ko samajhane kii aavashyaktaa ho tabhi unki sandhi kaa hawala diya jaae
 In Hindi it would be good to accept them as independent words
 2
9
1 sanskritmulak tatsam shabdon kii vartanee ko jyon-kaa-tyon grahan kiya jaae
 Therefore, it would not be appropriate to change 'brahma' to 'brahma', 'sign' to 'symbol', 'urun' to 'urin'
 isi prakaar grahit, drushtavy, pradarshini, atyaadhik, anadhikaar aadi ashuddh prayog grahya nahin hai
 Instead, only the home, writing, exhibition, excessive, unauthorized should be written in their place
 2
9
2 jin tatsam shabdon main teen vyanjanon ke sanyog kii sthiti main ek dwitvamoolak vyanjan lupt ho gaya he use na likhane kii chhot he
 Such as - Ardh> Ardha, Tattva> Element etc
 2
10
1 hindi main i, ou kaa prayog do prakaar ke uccharan ko vyakt karne ke liye hota he
 The first type is pronounced like the original vowels in 'hai', 'and' etc
; While the second type of pronunciation is still safe in words such as 'gawaiya', 'crow', etc
 donon hi prakaar ke uccharanon ko vyakt karne ke liye inhen chihnon kaa prayog kiya jaae
 Modifications such as 'gavayya', 'qava' etc
 are not required
 anya udhaaharan hai :– bhaiya, saiyad, taiyaar, hauva aadi
 2
10
2 The personal names of Iyer, Nayyar, Ramayya etc
 of the south should not be written as Aayar, Nayyar, Ramaiya etc
 according to the Hindi pronunciation, because its pronunciation is different in the native language
 2
10
3 awwal, kavvaal, qawwali jaise shabd prachlit hai
 They should be kept intact in writing
 2
10
4 sanskrit ke tatsam shabd 'shayya' ko 'shaiya' na likhaa jaae
 2
11
1 The past participle suffix should be written by mixing the verb 'kara'
 jaise :– milakar, kha-pikar, ro-rokar aadi
 2
11
2 'tax' will be formed from tax + tax and 'karake' from tax + tax
 2
12
1 kriya roopon main 'karne vaala', 'aane vaala', 'bolne vaala' aadi ko alag likhaa jaae
 Such as: - i am going to go home, people to go
 2

 2
12
3 When 'wala' comes as a suffix, it will be written in accordance with 2
12
2; Otherwise separately
 yah vaala, yah vaali, pehle vaala, acha vaala, laal vaala, kal vaali baat aadi main vaala nirdeshak shabd he
 Therefore, it should be written separately
 isi tarah lambey baalo vaali ladki, dadhi vaala aadmi aadi shabdon main bhi vaala alag likhaa jayega
 From this we can differentiate at the level of composition
 jaise :–gaanwvaala - villager gaanv vaala makaan - village house 2
13
1 Where acclaimed Y, and v are used optionally, the first forms should be used, ie, done, new, new, happened, etc
 yah niyam kriya, visheshan, avyay aadi sabhi roopon or sthitiyon main lagu mana jaae
 Such as: - Shown, for Ram, with book, New Delhi etc
 2
13
2 jahaan 'ya' shrutimulak vyakaranik parivartan na hokar shabd kaa hi mul tatv ho vahaan vaikalpik shrutimulak swaratmak parivartan karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he

 urdu se aae arabi-farsi mulak ve shabd jo hindi ke ang ban chuke hai or jinaki videshi dhvaniyon kaa hindi dhvaniyon main roopaantar ho chukaa he, hindi rup main hi sweekaar kiye ja sakate hai
 Such as: - pen, fort, stain etc
 par jahaan unka shuddh videshi rup main prayog abhisht ho athwa uccharangat bhed bataanaa aavashyak ho, vahaan unke hindi main prachlit roopon main yathasthaan nukte lagaae jaaen
 Such as: - Food: Food, Raj: Raaz, Fun: Fun etc
 angrezi ke jin shabdon main ardhvivruth 'o' dhwani kaa prayog hota he, unke shuddh rup kaa hindi main prayog abhisht hone par 'aa' kii maatra ke upar ardhachandra kaa prayog kiya jaae 
 As regards the adoption of new words and their Devanāgarī transliteration from English and other foreign languages, Devanāgarī transliteration of international vocabulary was done in august-september, 1962 by the Commission on Scientific and Technical Terminology in the Symposium of Linguists on Scientific Vocabulary
 Recommendation is notable
 usamen yah kaha gaya he ki angrezi shabdon kaa devanagari lipyantaran itnaa clisht nahin hona chahie ki uske vartmaan devanagari varnon main anek nae sanket-chihn lagane paden
 Devanāgarī transliteration of English words should be as close as possible to the standard English pronunciation
 hindi main kuch prachlit shabd aise hai jinaki vartanee ke do-do rup baraabar chal rahe hai
 There is a similar recognition of both forms in Vidvatsamaj
 kuch udhaaharan hai :– gardan / gardan, garmi / garmi, baraf / barf, bilkul / bilkul, sardi / sardi, kursii / kursi, bharti / bhartee, fursat / fursat, bardaasht / bardaasht, waapas / vaapis, aakhirkaar / akhirkaar, baratan / bartan, dubaara / dobaaraa, dukaan / duukaan, beemaari / bimaari aadi
 The first of these alternative forms should be preferred

 The power generated by the energy of falling or flowing water is called hydroelectricity
 san 2005 main vishwa bhar main lagbhag 816 gwe jalavidyut utpann kii jaati thi jo ki vishwa kii sampoorn vidyut urja kaa lagbhag 20% he
 This electricity is pollution free
 evam yah paryaavaran ke anukool he
 The economically exploitable and viable water potential in India is estimated at 84,000 MW at a 66 percent weight factor
 iske atirikt, chote, laghu tathaa sookshm jal vidyut yojanaon se sthapit kshamta ke 6780 megawatt kaa aankalan kiya gaya he
 56 sites have also been identified for pumped storage schemes with accumulated installed capacity of 94,000 MW
 tathaapi, abhi tak is sambhavyata ke keval 19
9 pratshit kaa hi dohan kiya ja sakaa he
 Electricity is the hydroelectric power obtained from water generated by water
 vidyut shakti ke janan kii vidhiyon main jalavidyut bahut mahatvapurn hai
 One-third of the entire electric power of the world is received in the form of hydroelectricity
 yon to kisi bhi rup main uplabdh urja ko vidyutshakti ke janan ke liye prayukt kiya ja saktaa he
 The energy contained in the water falling in the waterfall has been used since ancient times to run the watermill, but the use of this energy for electric power has been given from the twentieth century itself
 na keval girte hue jal main nihit urja kaa upyog shakti janan ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, varan behate hue pani main nihit gatij urja kaa upyog bhi shakti janan ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 For this, the first is to choose a place where the dam can be stored in plenty of water and the power contained therein can be used to generate electricity for power generation by using canals or open canals in power stations
 upyukt sthaan kii talash ke liye varsha tathaa jameen donon kaa adhyayan karnaa hota he
 The dam is built in such a place where the dam made in the lowest price can store maximum water
 iske liye sthaan kii prakritik dasha aisi honi chahie ki koi nadi ghati main hoti hui pahaado ke bich sankare maarg se guzarati ho, jisase sakare sthaan par band banaakar nadi ke upree bhaag ko ek bade jalashay main parivartit kiya ja sake
 Another agar is built above the dam, from where the water is carried by open canals or taps to the power house
 yah pani bijlighar main sthit bade bade tarabinon ko chalaata he, jinase yojit janitron main vidyut shakti kaa janan hota he
 The turbine is located on the face of the draft tube made of cement concrete
 pani guide wain main hota hua tarabine ke bladon ko ghumata he or is prakaar apane nihit urja kaa tarabine ke chalaane main upyog karata he
 The mechanical energy of the moving turbine is converted into electrical energy and thus the energy contained in water takes the form of hydroelectricity
 tarabine main is prakaar pani main nihit shakti kaa upyog ho jane ke pashchaat, pani draft-tub main se hota hua visarjani kulya main jaataa he, jahaan se vah phir nadi main ja miltaa he
 The design of the draft-tube is such that the remaining energy of the water is slowly depleted, so that it does not damage the river banks when it comes out
 pani main nihit urja, uske aaytan tathaa sheersh par nirbhar karti he
 Hydropower schemes can be divided into three parts according to the head: 1
 ucch sheersh yojana - lagbhag 200 meter se adhik
 2
 Medium Head Plan - 50 meters to 200 meters
 3
 nimna sheersh yojana - 50 meter se kam
 Both the size and the shape of the plan depends on the top and also the type of its turbines accordingly
 is prakaar ucch sheersh ke liye francis tarabine evam paston chakra upyukt hote hai
 For medium head, pressure turbine with listener flow is used
 nimna sheersh ke liye nodak praroop kaa tarabine adhik upyukt hota he
 In high-end schemes, generally, the volume of water is not high
 isliye pani ko nalon dwaara le jaakar tarabine ke tund se ranor kii waltiyon par choda jaataa he, jisase pani main nihit urja ranor ko chalaane main samarth hoti he
 The turbine can control the output of the turbine by controlling the flow and speed of the water and by varying the angle of water released on the buckets and thus control the power generated
 baltiyon ke kone kaa vicharan karnaa bhi sambhav he or donon niyantranon ko swat: chaalit rup se bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 The propellant turbine runner has only three or four wings
 ye baari ispaat ke bane hote hai
 Low head plans often have a very high water volume
 at: inamen pani ko nalon main le janaa sambhav nahin hota or khuli naalee kaa upyog karnaa hota he
 To obtain the output corresponding to the load, it is necessary to vary the amount of water going into the turbine, which is edited by opening the door
 ye dwaar guide pichhafalak kii bhanti hote hai or inaki sthiti pani kaa niyantran karti he
 Being heavy, these gates are driven by hydraulic pressure
 jis prakaar peltan chakra ke guide pichhafalak, athwa baltiyon, ke kone kaa vicharan kiya jaataa he, usee prakaar inhen bhi swat: chaalit rup se pravartit kiya ja saktaa he
 The automatic driven variance is performed by the servo motor
 yah chota sa motor hota he, jo dravchaalit daabak kaa vicharan karata he
 Its investment is only a fraction of the output of the turbine, so it varies accordingly
 is prakaar is motor dwaara kiya gaya kaary tarabine ke nirgat par, jo uske upar bhaar ke anuroop hota he, nirbhar karata he or swat: chaalit rup se dravchaalit daabak ko gata badhaakar usee ke anusaar guide pichhafalak, athwa dwaara khulaai, kaa niyantran kar detaa he, athwa baltiyon ke kone kaa vyavasthaapan kar detaa he
 Propellant type turbine is the main one in propellant type turbine
 isaki visheshta isaki majboot or ucch dakshata he
 Another feature of this is that the load variance has very little effect on efficiency, due to which this turbine is very suitable for variable loads
 madhyam sheersh yojanaon main, saamanyat:, mishrit pravaahavala tarabine adhik prayukt hota he, parantu sheersh ke anuroop hi uskaa chayan adhik nirbhar karata he
 Steady guide lanes are used to move water to the turbine
 iske nirgat kaa vicharan unke kone ke vicharan se kiya jaataa he
 a low-heading turbine is usually located above the open shafts
 ye sarpil praroop ke aavaran se ghire hote hai, jisase pani ko ek samaan rup se guide pichhafalak dwaara le jaaya ja sake
 In high-powered turbines, this cover is made of metal
 tarabine kshaitij evam urdhwadhar donon prakaar ke ho sakate hai
 But in general, vertical is more used
 inamen bering vishisht prakaar kaa hota he, jise mashin par pratishthit parshv aghat bhi vahan karnaa hota he
 Hence these are called shock wearings
 vering tathaa duusare gatiman bhaagon kaa snehan bhi apane-aap main ek kathin samasya hoti he
 Pressure lubrication method is used for this
 isamen snehak tel ko dabaakar snehan kiye janevaale sthanon main bheja jaataa he
 Pressure is generated by the oil pump
 daab ghat jane par, mashin ke apane aap band ho jane kii vyavastha bhi hoti he, jisase aisi paristhiti main use kshati na pahunche
 There is an oil filter to clean the lubricating oil and there is also an oil cooler to cool the oil that gets heated after lubrication
 jalavidyut yojanaon main sabase adhik mahatv unki sthiti kaa he
 Their condition depends mainly on natural and physical causes
 mote taur par kisi jalavidyut yojana se 1,000 ghan foot prati second ke pravaah se 150 foot kaa sheersh uplabdh hone par lagbhag 10 megawatt kii shakti uplabdh hogi
 The reservoir can also be estimated on the basis that 1 foot of water over an area of 1
13 square miles generates a flow of only 1 cubic foot per second
 at: 1,000 ghan foot prati second kaa pravaah paane ke liye jalashay main 113 varg mile ke kshetrafal main ausat se 10 foot gaharaa pani hona chahie
 For any hydroelectric scheme to be practical, it is necessary to have maximum head and flow
 kam sheershawali yojanaayen tabhi vyaavhaarik ho sakati hai, jab pani kaa pravaah paryaapt ho
 High-top schemes can be practical even at low flows
 bijlighar kii sthiti band ke nikat hona anivaary nahin he
 The reservoir can be on the mountain and the powerhouse can be built at the foot of the mountain to get to the top
 aisi dasha main pani kii badi badi nalikaaon dwaara bijlighar tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 Plans with higher heads are usually of this type
 bahut se sthanon par pahari ko katkar surang ke dwaara pani ko pahari ke duusari or bijlighar tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 It is not compulsory for the power house to be on earth
 bahut se bijlighar prithvi ke andar bhi hote hai or us tak lift dwaara hi pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 a similar underground power plant has been built in Maithon
 aise bijli ghar swachaalit praroop ke haate hai or duurastha niyantran dwaara prithvital se chaalit hote hai
 Although these power plants are built mainly inside the earth due to natural reasons, they are very important from a strategic point of view
 kam sheershawali yojanaayen hamaare desh main bahut hai
 Many power stations have been built over the Ganges and Sharda canals, in which only the top of 20 to 30 feet is used
 ye yojanaayen pani kaa pravaah adhik hone ke kaaran vyaavhaarik ho saki hai
 Hydropower schemes are mainly in Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, France, Canada, Russia and USA
 bharat bhi jalavidyut yojanaon main bahut peeche nahin he or yahan kii kuch yojanaayen vishwa kii mahanatam yojanaon main gini jaati hai, jaise, bhakhra-nangal, damodar ghati, rihand, hyrakund, nagarjun sagar, koyna, shivasamudram, periyar aadi
 Many hydroelectric schemes are also multipurpose
 mukhyat: inke saath sinchai evam baadh rodhak yojanaayen bhi shaamil rahati hai, jisase kshetra kaa sarvangin vikaas kiya ja sake
 Damodar Valley Corporation was also established in India on the basis of Tennessee Valley Corporation in USA
 pichley bees varshon main bahut si mahatvapurn jalavidyut yojanaayen bani hai or sabhi jagah jalavidyut sambhaavnaaon kaa adhyayan kar yojanaayen banaai ja rahi hai
 In hydroelectric planning, although there is a lot of expenditure initially, most of the schemes are successful from the economic point of view due to lower operating expenses
 inke sanyatra kaa jivan bhi apekshaakrit bahut adhik hota he
 Their main drawback is actually their distance from consumer locations
 ye yojanaayen jahaan chahen vahaan ke liye nahin banaai ja saktin
 For example, if the demand for power is in Calcutta, it is not possible to implement the hydroelectric scheme there
 himalay se nikalanevaali nadiyon main apaar jalashakti nihit he, parantu vahaan shakti kii maang nahin he
 In this way, the power generated by the hydroelectric scheme often has to be transmitted to great distances
 at:, jalavidyut yojana kaa saapeksh rup se adhyayan karne ke liye preshnatantr kaa vyay bhi lagaana aavashyak he
 Even then, hydroelectricity is mostly cheap

 As Governor General of Pakistan, Jinnah tried to rehabilitate millions of refugees
 saath hi, unhone apane desh kii videsh niti, suraksha niti or aarthik niti banane main mahatvapurn yogadan diya
 Significantly, the partition of Pakistan and India is due to the political greed of Jinnah and Nehru! mohammad ali jinnah kaa janm aadhunik singh praant ke karachi zile ke vazeer mesun main hua aisa bataate hai, lekin kuch kitabon main inkaa janm sthaan jhark ko bataaya gaya he
 According to old documents, Jinnah was born on 20 October 1875

 In England, he left the Apprentice to study law
 unniis saal kii choti umr main ve vakil ban gayi
 With this, his interest in politics was also aroused
 ve dadabhai nauroji or firozshah mehta ke prashansak ban gayi
 He also campaigned with the students for Dadabhai Naoroji's entry into the British Parliament
 tab tak unhone bharatiyon ke saath ho rahe bhedbhaav ke khilaaf sanvaidhanik najariya apana liya tha
 In the last days of his stay in Britain his father's business collapsed and Jinnah was forced to take over the family

 Jinnah joined the Indian National Congress in 1896
 tab tak congress bhartiya raajnneetik kaa sabase bada sanghathan ban chukaa tha
 Like ordinary moderates, Jinnah did not demand any time for the independence of India, instead he kept demanding from the British for better education, law, industry, employment etc
 in the country

 Jinnah was the agent of the 1916 Lucknow Pact
 yah samjhauta lig or congress ke bich hua tha
 This common platform of the Congress and the Muslim League became the platform of self-government and struggle against the British exploiters
 1918 main jinna ne parsi dharm kii ladki se duusari shaadi kii
 Their inter-religious marriage was widely opposed in Parsi and fundamentalist Muslim societies
 ant main unki patni rattibai ne islam kabool kar liya
 In 1919 she gave birth to her only child, Dina
 jinna kaa congress se matbhed usee samay shuru ho gayi the jab 1918 main bhartiya raajnneeti main gandhiji kaa udai hua
 Gandhiji promoted non-violent civil disobedience and Hindu values in politics
 gandhiji ke anusaar, satya, ahimsa or savinay avagya se swatantrata or swashaasan paaya ja saktaa he, jabaki jinna kaa mat unase alag tha
 Jinnah believed that freedom can be achieved only by constitutional struggle
 
 congress ke duusare netaaon se alag, gandhiji videshi kapade nahin pahante the, angreji kii jagah zyada se zyada hindi kaa prayog karte the or sanathan hindu chintan kaa hi prayog raajnneeti main karte the
 These were some of the reasons that Gandhiji gained immense popularity
 gandhi ji ne khilaafat andolan kaa samarthan kiya tha jabaki jinna ne iskaa khulkar virodh kiya
 Jinnah believed that this would promote religious fundamentalism
 1920 main jinna ne congress ke istipha de diya
 Along with this, he also warned that the principle of mass struggle of Gandhiji will not reduce the division between Hindus and Muslims
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki isse donon samudaayon ke andar bhi jabardasht vibhaajan paidaa hoga
 Jinnah drew the dividing line between the Congress and the British supporters as soon as he became President of the Muslim League

 The two later reached an agreement, known as the fourteen sutras of Jinnah
 haalanki ise congress or duusari raajnneetik partiyon ne baad main khaarij kar diya
 His personal life, especially his marital life, was affected due to overwork in political work
 haalanki unhone apane vaivaahik jivan ko bachaane ke liye europe kii yatra bhi kii, lekin 1927 main pati or patni alag ho gayi
 In 1929, his wife died after a serious illness, after which Jinnah continued to remain unhappy

 In the 1937 Central Legislative Assembly elections, the Muslim League gave a tough fight to the Congress and captured most of the seats in the Muslim areas
 haalanki is chunaav main muslim bahul punjab, sindh or pashchimottar seemaant praant main use karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Jinnah invited Congress for alliance
 pehle to donon ne faisla kiya ki ve angrejon se milakar muqabla karenge, lekin jinna ne shart rakkhi ki congress ko musalamaanon ke liye pruthak nirvachan kshetra or muslim lig ko bharat ke musalamaanon kaa pratinidhi maananaa hoga, jise congress ne asweekaar kar diya
 There were many Muslim leaders in the Congress at that time, so it was not easy for him to consider the League as representative of Indian Muslims
 jinna ne kai congress netaaon se baatcheet bhi kii or congress ne lig ko congress main vilay karne kaa prastaav bhi pesh kiya parantu vaarta phir bhi vifal ho gayi
 Jinnah was roaming around India and giving speeches
 1930 main muslim lig ke ek bhaashan main mohammad ikbaal ne uttar pashchim bhartiya rajya aar jur diya tha na kii pakistan desh kii
 In 1933, Rahmat Ali printed the pamphlet and renamed the country as Pakistan
 congress ke saath vaarta vifal hone ke baad jinna ko bhi yah vichaar aayaa ki musalamaanon ko apane adhikaron kii raksha ke liye ek alag desh milanaa hi chaiye bina iske kaam nahin banegaa
 Later, Jinnah became absolutely convinced that both Hindus and Muslims are citizens of different countries, so they should be separated
 unka yahi vichaar baad main jaakar jinna ke dvirashtrawaad kaa siddhanth kahalaaya
 Jinnah said that injustice would be done to Muslims in India and in the end civil war would spread
 yah baat jinna ne ikbaal ke saath patrachaar main bhi uthaayi
 a resolution passed in the 1940 Lahore session stating that the main objective of the Muslim League is the creation of Pakistan
 congress ne is prastaav ko asweekaar kar diya
 Leaders like Maulana Abbul Kalam Azad and organizations like jamaat-islami strongly condemned it
 26 july 1943 ko khaksaar ugravadiyon ke hamale main jinna ghayal ho gayi
 Jinnah founded the Don newspaper in 1941, through which he propagated his idea

 jon ludon makadam scotland kaa engeniper or sadak-nirmaataa tha
 He developed a new process of making smooth and hard surfaced roads known as macadamization
 sadak-nirmaan par aaj bhi makadam kaa prabhaav dikhataa he
 Makadam was born in Scotland

 Returned in 1783
 vah cams coliyari kaa kamdhaam dekhtaa tha jo britani taar company ko koyala aapurti karti thi
 Scientific construction of the roadway started in the 19th century
 jalabaddh sadak kaa janmdata makadam shaayad hi janata rahaa hoga ki ek din sadak ejiniyaron ke sansar main uskaa naam amar hoga
 For over a hundred years, the Makadam page is considered to be of the highest order

 In essence, a 'staggered macadam' is prepared by laying the ballast floor
 roller chalaakar gittiyon ko patharchurna or pani se 'anyonyabaddh' kiya jaataa he
 The basic requirement of the Makadam road is the strong mobilization of ballast using the addition of anything suitable
 iske liye sadak kai paraton main banaai jaati he or pehali parat ghani or majboot ho jane par hi usapar duusari parat chadhaai jaati he
 This type of structure is suitable only for the base, but if the traffic intensity is low, then it is also applicable for the upper fold
 makadam sadak kii sabase badi aavashyaktaa nichali sataha kaa majboot or thas hona he
 Hence, the lower surface is first brought to the desired surface and the roller is formed
 nichali sataha main sookshmakanik mitti, jaise silt mitti hone par ruksh samucchy arthath pathar rodi rakhane ke purv usapar aavaran kii ek parat rakhi jaati he, jise bichali sataha kehete hai
 The lower surface acts as an insulator
 roller chalaate samay sookshmakanik mitti ko ruksh samucchy main aane se yah rokatii he
 This is followed by the main task of spreading the rough aggregate to a predetermined depth and strengthening it by a roller
 roller dwaara samucchy ke thas ho jane par prishth par aavaran chadhaaya jaataa he
 The cover is plated so that all the gaps are filled properly
 rictiyon ke purna ho jane par pani kaa chhidkaav karte hue roller chalaaya jaataa he
 By doing this, the entire set of stones can be formed and folded together in total form
 tarai tathaa sukhai ke baad sadak chaalu ho jaati he
 Nowadays a layer of gola stone or brick is given under the stone blocks
 ise 'roda bharaai' kehete hai
 Even after paying much attention at the time of road construction, some errors remain, due to which the dilapidated road starts deteriorating quickly
 trutiyon ke kaaran barsaat ke dinon main sadak main pani risne lagata he
 Ballast causes friction in traffic, causing dust and mud
 jalabaddh sadak ke nirmaan main kharch kam padataa he, kyonki isamen keval sthaneey saamagree kaa hi upyog hota he, shram kam lagata he or baari bharkam mashiinon kaa prayog nahin karnaa padataa
 It is very suitable for stage construction
 farsh ko chaahe jab majboot kiya ja saktaa he
 These qualities have made the road of Makadam road important

 Dust became a problem
 tej gati se chalane vaali gadiyon ke pahiyon ke neeche kam vaayu-daab kaa kshetra utpann hota he jo makadam se dhul ko khinch nikaalata he or sadak dhire-dhire 'khokhli' hoti jaati he
 At the same time, 'dust clouds' are formed with trains
 is samasya ke nidaan ke liye sadak ke upar taar chhidaka jaataa he
 Such a road is called a wire-bound road

 gurutvkarshan ke bare main pehali baar koi ganitiya sutara dene kii koshish ijak newton dwaara kii gayi jo ascharyajanak rup se sahi tha
 He proposed the theory of gravity
 newton ke siddhanth ko baad main albert oinstin dwaara saapekshata siddhant se badla gaya
 Earlier Varah Mihir had said that only some kind of power keeps things sticking to the earth
 gurutvkarshan siddhant par aadhunik kaam 16 veen ke ant main or 17 veen shatabdi kii shuruyaat main galileo galili ke kaam se shuru hua
 In his famous experiments used to drop balls from the Tower of Pisa, and later rotate the inclusions with careful measurement of the balls, Galileo showed that the gravitational acceleration is the same for all objects
 yah arestu ke vishwaas se ek bada prasthaan tha ki baari vastuon main ucch gurutvkarshan twaran hota he
 Galileo cited wind resistance as the reason that low-mass objects could fall into the atmosphere at a slower rate
 galileo ke kaam ne newton ke gurutv ke siddhant ke nirmaan ke liye manch taiyaar kiya Then Isaac Newton based on his fundamental discoveries that not only the earth, but every particle of the world keeps attracting every other particle towards itself
 do kanon ke bich kaary karanevaala aakarshan bal un kanon kii sanhatiyon ke gunanfal kaa samaanupati tathaa unke bich kii duuri ke varg kaa vyutkramanupati hota he
 The mutual attraction between the particles acting on gravity and the force generated by it is called the force of gravity
 newton dwaara pratipaadit uparyukt niyam ko newton kaa gurutvkarshan niyam kehete hai
 Sometimes this law is also called the inverse square law of gravity
 uparyukt niyam ko sutara rup main is prakaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : maan liya m1 or sanhati vaale m2 do pind paraspar d duuri par sthit hai
 The relation of the working force f between them will be: yahan g ek samaanupati niyatank he jiskaa maan sabhi padaarthon ke liye ek jaisaa rahata he
 This is called gravity constant
 is niyatank kii vimaa he or aankik maan prayukt ikai par nirbhar karata he
 By the formula, the force of attraction caused by the earth on a body can be calculated

 Gravity: "father, this earth, on which we dwell, rests upon?" Lilavati asked this question to her father Bhaskaracharya centuries ago
 iske uttar main bhaskaracharya ne kaha, "baale leelavati !, kuch log jo yah kehete hai ki yah prithvi sheshnag, kachua yaa hathi yaa anya kisi vastu par aadhaarit he to ve galat kehete hai
 Even if it is assumed that it rests on an object, the question remains, on which that object rests, and thus the cause of the cause and then its cause


 This sequence continues, then in jurisprudence This is called non-permanent defect
 leelavati ne kaha phir bhi yah prashn bana rahata he pitaaji ki prithvi kis cheez par tiki he? Then Bhaskaracharya said, why we cannot assume that the earth is not based on anything
 xxrep 5 
 yadi ham yah kahen ki prithvi apane hi bal se tiki he or ise gurutvkarshan shakti kah den to kya dosha he? Lilavati asked how this is possible
 tab bhaskaracharya siddhanth kii baat kehete hai ki vastuon kii shakti badi vicitra he
 Next says arthath prithvi main aakarshan shakti he
