 prithvi kii sataha par, bukamp apane aap ko, bhoomi ko hilaakar yaa visthapit kar ke prakat karata he
 When a major earthquake occurs in the epicenter offshore, it causes a substantial amount of displacement at the seashore, which is the cause of the tsunami
 bukamp ke jatke kabhi-kabhi bhuskhalan or jwalamukhi gatividhiyon ko bhi paidaa kar sakate hai
 In the most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event, a natural event]) or an event caused by humans — which produce seismic waves)

 The starting point of earthquake is called center or hypo center
 shabd uparicendre kaa arth he, bhoomi ke str par thik iske upar kaa bindu
 In the case of, many earthquakes originate away from the plate boundary and are related to stresses developed over a wide area of deformation, this deformation is caused by major irregularities in the fault zone
 Northridge bukamp aise hi ek kshetra main andh dabaav gati se sambandhit tha
 Another example is the obliquely concentric plate boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian plate where it passes through the northwestern part of the Zagros Mountains

 This is demonstrated by the central mechanism of earthquake
 sabhi tectonic plates main aantarik dabaav kshetra hote hai jo apni padosi platon ke saath antarkriya ke kaaran yaa talchhati ladaan yaa utraai ke kaaran hote hai
 
these stresses can be a sufficient cause of failure at the edge of present fault surfaces, these give rise to interplate earthquakes
 adhikansh tectonic bukamp 10 kilometre se adhik kii gaharaai se utpann nahin hote hai
 Earthquakes that occur at a depth of less than 70 kilometers are called 'shallow-center' earthquakes, while earthquakes occurring at depths between 70-300 kilometers are called 'mid-central' or 'inter-central' earthquakes

 The celestial bodies that revolve around the Sun are members of the solar family
 inamen grah, upgrah, kshudragrah, ghumaketu tathaa ulkaaye hai
 Those celestial small solid bodies that revolve around a star, especially the Sun, are planets
 saura parivaar ke grah hai : budh, shukr, prithvi, mangal, guru shani, vaaruni tathaa varun 
 Among these, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars and Yama are small and Guru, Varuni and Varuna are huge
 budh tathaa shukr kii kakshaayen surya ke saapeksh prithvi kii kaksha ke bheetar padati he
 Hence, it is called ingestion
 shesh bahirgrah hai
 The planets travel in elliptical orbits, which have the Sun in one navel
 donon nabhiyon se paridhi tak janevaali saral rekha ko deergh aksh tathaa dirghavritt ke centre se deergh aksh par lamb rekha ke paridhi paryant bhaag ko laghu aksh kehete hai
 The point of the ellipse circumference that lies on the long axis near the Sun is called Ravnich, and the point which is on the other side of the long axis is called the sunrise
 deergh aksh par suryocch tathaa ravinich sthiti hai, isaliye ise nichoch rekha kehete hai
 The angle of circumference of the Sun at the navel from Ravnich is called the angular angle
 grah ke ravinich athwa suryocch ke saapeksh parikrama kaal ko parivarsh kehete hai
 The orbits of the planets are not in the surface of the ecliptic, but are inclined to it
 grah kii kaksha tathaa krantivrutt ke sampatbindu ko paat kehete hai
 The point from where the planet moves upwards from the ecliptic is called Arohpath and the second Avarohpat
 akaash main grah kii sthiti jaanane ke liye hamen grah kaa deergh aksh, utkendratha, kaksha kii krantivrutt se nati, nirdeshkshan, suryocch kii sthiti tathaa paat kii sthiti kaa gyaan karnaa aavashyak he
 Two types of movements of rotation and rotation are found in the planets
 ek to ve apane kaksha main chalate hue surya kii parikrama karte hai, ise unka parikraman kehete hai
 When a planet revolves around the Sun relative to a star, it is called its Nakshatra period
 grah ke prithvi ke saapeksh parikraman kaal ko sanyuti kaal kehete hai
 The inhabitants of the Earth are seen to have an outward movement orbiting the Earth, but the inertia is seen oscillating east and west from the Sun
 yah unki kakshaon kii vishesh sthiti ke kaaran he
 The angular distance from the Sun relative to the Earth is called the extreme canopy
 jab antargrah surya tathaa prithvi ko milaanevaali saral rekha main hota he to use grah kii antaryuti tathaa jab antargrah tathaa prithvi ko milaanevaali saral rekha surya ke centre se hokar jaati he to use bahiryuti kehete hai
 When the line joining the Earth from the Earth goes through the Sun, it is called Samyuti and when the planet resides between the line joining the Earth and the Sun, it is called the separation of the planet
 grah kii ek sanyuti se duusari sanyuti tak ke samay ko sanyutikaal kehete hai bahirgrahon kaa yahi, prithvi ke saapeksh, raashichakr kii parikrama kaa kaal hota he
 Intragrahas often revolve around the zodiac during the Earth's orbit
 apni kakshaon main gati kii disha ek hi hone ke kaaran antargrah antaryuti ke asann tathaa bahirgrah viyuti ke asann kaal main prithvi ke saapeksh viruddh disha main chalate prathit hote hai
 For this reason, we see them going west in the zodiac
 yah grahon kii vakrgati he
 Shortly before the planets attain curvature, the motion relative to the Earth becomes constant
 isse grah sthir se prathit hote hai
 The curve of the planet at the time of inertia or vyutti is extremely high
 After some time it starts decreasing, then the planet starts moving at a steady speed
 antargrahon ke prakashit bhaag chandramaa kii tarah kam tathaa adhik prakashit hote rahete hai or ye kalaayen praapt karte hai
 Due to their very small sizes, their art is not visible without the instrument
 bahirgrahon kii kalaayen sadaa ardhadhik rahati he
 Just as planets orbit the Sun due to the gravity of the Sun, similarly Satellites revolve around the planets
 vyapak gurutvkarshan niyam se yah spasht he ki inaki dravyamatraayen apane grahon se kam hoti hai
 Earth's satellite is called Moon
 chandramaa kaa hamaare jivan se bahut sambandh he
 Lunar months are still practiced in many countries for religious acts
 chandramaa ko pracheen kaal main grah mana jaataa tha
 Apart from Earth, there are two satellites of Mars, 12 of Guru, 9 of Saturn, 5 of Varuni, and 2 of Varuna
 budh, shukr tathaa yama kaa koi bhi upgrah nahin he1 When the moon comes between the earth and the sun, the visible sun part of the earth is covered with it on the new moon day
 ise suryagrahan kehete hai
 Similarly, when the moon enters the shadow of the earth and becomes lightless on the full moon night, then it is eclipsed
 surya tathaa chandramaa ke grahan bahut prasiddh hai
 Eclipses of the Sun help a lot in studying the nature of the Sun's atmosphere and Kirit
 guru ke upgrahon ke grahanon ke adhyayan se sarvapratham prakaash ke veg ko gyaat kiya gaya
 The covering of the stars by the moon is called a constellation! bode ne grahon kii surya se dooriyaan jyotisheeya ikai main gyaat karne ke liye nimnlikhit niyam bataaya tha-- Du 0
4 + 0
3 ′ 2 n, where n = - ¥, 0,1,2,3,4, xxrep 8 
 This gives the distance of Mercury 0
4, the distance of Venus = 0
7, the distance of Earth - 1
0 and The distance to Mars gained 1
6
 yahan tak to praaia: thik he, kintu guru kii duuri is niyam se thik nahin baithti
 But if we imagine another planet in the middle, then the distances of the remaining planets fit with this rule
 isaliye jyotishiyon ne mangal tathaa guru kii kaksha ke bich anya grah kii khoj shuru kii
 This gave them many asteroids
 sarvapratham kshudragrah sito kaa avishkaar janvari, 1801 isvi main italy ke jyotishi piyaazi ne kiya tha
 In 1950, the number of asteroids reached 1,600
 anumaan he ki inaki sankhya 1,00,000 hogi
 These are celestial bodies made of very low-density matter, which when approaching the Sun, illuminate their tail-like part far away from the Sun in the opposite direction
 inke aakaar ko mukhyatya do bhaagon main baanta jaataa he
 The round densely illuminated part is called the head and the lighted part is called the tail
 sir main inkaa nabhik hota he
 They go in conic routes under the control of the Sun

 Many comets rotate periodically in elliptical orbits
 inamen heli kaa dhoomaketu prasiddh he
 The Guru has a great influence on the speed of comets
 iske kaaran inaki kaksha badal jaati he
 In ancient times, the sight of comets was considered to be a sign of evil
 bahudhaa raatri ke samay kuch chamkile padaarth prithvi kii ore ativeg se aate dikhaai dete hai
 These are called star breaks or meteorites
 ulkaaye hamen tabhi dikhalaai detii hai jab ye ativeg se prithvi ke vayumandal main ghusati hai
 Their velocity ranges from 11 to 62 kilometers per second
 ye jab hamaare dharaatal se 100 tathaa 120 kilometre kii duuri ke bheetar hoti hai to hamen pratham baar dikhalaai padati hai or 50 yaa 60 kilometre kii duuri tak aane par adrishy ho jaati hai
 In fact, on entering the earth's dense atmosphere from extreme force, fire is produced in their material and they burn
 inaki dravyamatra atyalp hoti he
 Sometimes, when meteors fall on the earth, they make big pits
 yadi hamaara vayumandal hamaari raksha na kare, to ulkapaat se prithvi tathaa hamaari bahut haani ho 
 These are self-illuminated celestial bodies with hot gases, which associate their matter with personal gravity
 taron ke samooh ek vishesh akruti dhaaran kar lete hai, inhen taramandal kehete hai
 The constellations of the ecliptic are called zodiac signs, which are Aries, Taurus, Gemini etc
 12
 sarpdhar kaa kuch bhaag vrishchik tathaa dhanu raashiyon ke bich main he
 There are 21 constellations between the ecliptic and the celestial pole, and the 47 constellations between the remaining part of the serpent and the ecliptic and the south celestial pole
 antarrashtriya pranali main inke kuch naam greek puranakthaon par aadhaarit hai tathaa kuch ke naam arabi ke hai
 The Indian names of the constellations Ashwini, Bharani, Mrigashira etc
 are also associated with mythology
 raashiyon main taaren kii chamak ke kram ko bataane ke liye greek varnmaala kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The order of brightness of the constellations in which the number of stars exceeds the letters of the alphabet is also expressed by numerals
 prayek kantimaan apane agle kantimaan se 2
5 guna adhik chamkila hota he
 The lower the radius, the 2
5 the relative brightness of the stars will increase
 is prakaar 1 se 6 tak kantimaan ke taron kii chamak kaa anupaat 100 : 40 : 16 : 6
3 : 2

 So far, the number of stars in our galaxy seen by large telescopes is 1011
 taron kii gatiyon ko do bhaagon main baant dete hai
 One is that from which we move back and forth in the direction of our sight, and the other, from which the stars appear to be moving in some direction relative to the distant stars
 pratham ko trigyaveg tathaa dwitiya ko nijee gati kehete hai
 The gain of both the velocities is the actual velocity of the star
 trigyaveg ko varnakram kii laal rekhaon ke vichlan se dopalar ke niyam dwaara janaa jaataa he, tathaa nijee gati ko kuch varshon ke antaraal se liye gaye photographon dwaara
 The personal speed of the wires is very low
 jyotishi barnard ne sabase adhik nijee gativale taare kii vaarshik nijee gati 10
3 gyaat kii he
 Annual parallax is used to measure the distances of stars
 prithvi kii kaksha kaa vyas yadi aadhaar maan len or sheershabindu par taare ko maane to sheershabindu par bana kone dvigun vaarshik lamban hoga
 For this, two stars have to be pierced at a difference of six months
 kisi bhi taare kaa vaarshik lamban 1
00 se adhik nahin
 The star whose parallax is 1
00 is 2,06,265 times the radius of the Earth's orbit
 is duuri ko ek parsek kehete hai
 The number of wires is so much that for them, Parsek works as a unit
 taron kii dooriyaan naapane ke liye prakashavarsh bhi ikai ke rup main prayukt hota he
 a light year is the distance that light travels at its own speed in a year
 yah 58,60,00,00,00,000 mile he tathaa parsek kaa 0
307 he
 The annual parallax of the very nearby constellations is known by knowledge of private motion relative to the Sun, the dynamics of pair stars and the rest by spectral method
 taron ke aakaar ke adhaar par unke atidanavaakar, danavaakar, saamanyakram tathaa vamanakaar bhed kiye jate hai
 Their size gets progressively smaller

 In fact it already exists, which has exploded
 navtara kii visheshta yah he ki ekaek ati prakashit hokar visphutit ho jaataa he
 The light of some stars keeps increasing and decreasing in the order
 inhen chal taare kehete hai
 Among these, the stars of Syphius IV and RR Lyra are important
 sifius chaturth kii shrenee ke taron ko syphid kehete hai
 The fluctuations of light in them have a definite relation to their times
 jahaan aise taare paae jate hai yahan is sambandh se tarapunj kii duuri gyaat karnaa saral hota he
 RR Lyra stars are often at the same height
 inase akashganga pranali kii duuri gyaat karne main sahaayta mili he
 To know the temperature of the nakshatras, the alphabet is obtained by Jyotirmithi
 is prakaar laal rang ke taron ke tal kaa taap 2,000o-3,000o ketto, naarangi rang ke taron kaa 3,000o-5000o ketto or nile rang ke taron kaa 12,000o-20,000o-30,000o ketto athwa or upar hota he
 In fact, accurate knowledge of colors is done through spectral method
 isiliye taap ke liye varnakramdarshi ke aadhaar par taron ke bhed ko angreji varnmaala ke bade aksharon se vyakt karte hai
 Thus, O, B, A, F, G, k M, R, N, S, are distinguished by the spectral sequence of stars

0001 ke baraabar he
 The basic elements of the average star are 70% hydrogen, 28% helium, 1
5% carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and neon and 
5% iron heavy elements
 taron ke centre kii bheeshan garmi se hydrogen ke anu helium ke anuon main parivartit hote rahete hai
 In this molecular reaction some mass is converted into energy, which gives the stars infinite energy
 iskaa ye prakaash ke rup main vitaran karte rahete hai
 The age of the stars is decided on the basis of this process
 atyadhik prakaashmaan taron kii ausat aayu 106 varsh, saamaanya kram ke taron kii 1010 se lekar 1013 varsh tak kii hoti he
 It looks like a broad spectrum of bluish, bright constellations extending from north to south on any night of Krishna Paksha

 We can divide these substances into these parts: nebulae, starfish, starfish and galaxies
 niharikas gas se bane megh hoti hai, jinke anu paas ke kisi bahut ushn taare ke prakhar prakaash ke kaaran ynikrut hokar chamakane lagate hai
 These are called illuminated nebulae, such as the nebula of Mrigashira
 jin gas meghon ko kisi ushn nakshatra kii urja nahin milti unke anu prakashit nahin ho pate or ve anya taron ke prakaash ke avarohak ho jate hai
 Those parts are darker than the nearby illuminated parts
 aisi kaali akruti ko kaali niharika kehete hai, jaise ashwasir niharik
 Initially, the meaning of the term neharika was unclear, and larger visionaries called any blurred, or more illuminated area, a neharika, such as the Devyani neharika
 kintu vah neeharika na hokar swayan akashganga he
 Some group of stars appear from the spots of light without seeing the instruments, due to which some small stars and few bright stars appear
 doordarshee yantra se dekhne par inamen saikadon taare tathaa ek do niharika jaise padaarth bhi dikhalaai dete hai, jaise krittika taraguchh
 The stars of the trilogy are often seen moving at a private pace
 taraguchh do prakaar ke hote hai : akashgangeey taraguchh tathaa goleey taraguchh
 Kritika taragukh is a galactic galaxy and appears without a device
 ek akashgangeey taraguchh main kuch sau se lekar kuch hajaar tak chamkile taare dikhalaai pad jate hai
 The celestial galaxy lives in or near the surface of the Milky Way
 chamkile taraguchh akashganga ke dharaatal se 100 se lekar 1,000 prakashwarshon tak kii duuri par sthit hai, kintu adhikansh 1,000 se 15,000 prakashwarshon kii duuri par sthit hai
 Spherical galaxies are far from the surface of the galaxy

 Random-access is known by memory), a form of computer data storage
 aaj yah ekikrut paripath kaa rup dhaaran karti he jo sangrahit data ko kisi bhi kram main, arthath jo ichha ho, yadrichhik) abhigamit hone kii anumati pradaan karata he
 The term random thus refers to the fact that any part of the data can be returned within a specified time regardless of its physical location and whether it is related to the previous part of the data
 yah system bas ke saath kii aavruti par kaam karti he to SDRAM kehalaati he jo aajkal computaron main sabase adhik prayukt hoti he

 In these devices, speed takes longer than data transfer and retrieval time varies depending on the physical state of the next subject
 shabd ram aksar asthir yaa volatile prakaar kii memory memory modul) se sambandhit hota he jahaan bijli kaa sanchaalan band ho jane par soochna kho jaati he
 There are many other types of memory RAM as well, mostly ROM and a type of flash memory called nor-flash

 static RAM is aur daynemic RAM
 vyapak riteble yadrichhik-abhigam memory kaa ek praarambhik prakaar varsh 1949 se 1952 tak viksit chumbakeey kor memory tha or baad main san 1960 ke dashak ke ant main or san 1970 ke dashak ke armbh main sthir or gatisheel ekikrut ram paripathon kaa vikaas hone tak adhikansh computaron main iskaa prayog kiya jaataa tha
 Previously, computers used relays, delay line memory, or a variety of vacuum tube arrangements to implement "main" memory functions, some with random access and some not
 Coils constructed from vacuum tube triodes and later from discrete transistors were used for relatively small and fast memory such as random-access register banks and registers
 ekikrut rome paripathon ke vikaas se pehle, sthaayee yadrichhik-abhigam memory kaa nirmaan aksar adress visanketakon dwaara sanchalit ardhchaalak diod metrison kaa prayog karke kiya jaataa tha
 Modern types of writeable rams typically store a bit of data either in a flip-flop state such as an aceram, or as a charge in a capacitor such as a DIRAM, EPROM, EEPROM, and Flash
 kuch prakaaron main samta bit yaa truti sudhaar code kaa prayog karke sangrahit data main memory truti kahalaane vaale yadrichhik dosha kaa pataa lagane ke liye or / yaa unhen sudhaarney ke liye circuitary hoti he
 Instead of storing read-only types of RAM, ROM, charge , uses a metal mask to permanently activate / deactivate selected transistors
 chunki esaram or diram donon hi asthir hote hai isliye computer bhandaaran ke anya roopon jaise discs or chumbakeey tepe kaa prayog paaramparik computaron main sthaayee bhandaaran ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Many new products rely instead on flash memory for the maintenance of data when they are not used, such as pdas or small music players
 Some personal computers, such as many fast computers and netbooks, have also replaced magnetic disks with flash drives
 flash memory ke saath, sidhe code nishpaadan kii anumati pradaan karte hue keval nor prakaar yatharth yadrichhik abhigam main sakasham he or isliye aksar rome ke bajaay iskaa prayog kiya jaataa he; kam laagat vaale nand prakaar kaa prayog aam taur par memory cardon or thos-avasthaa vaale drivon main thok bhandaaran ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Like a microprocessor, a memory chip is an integrated circuit composed of millions of transistors and capacitors)
 computer memory ke sabase saamaanya rup, gatisheel yadrichhik abhigam memory ) main memory cell kaa nirmaan karne ke liye ek transister or ek sandharitra ko joda jaataa he jo keval ek bit data ko darshata he
 The capacitor contains a bit of information - a 0 or a 1
 The transistor acts like a switch that allows the control circuitry of the memory chip to read the capacitor or change its state
 kai computer tantron main ek memory padanukram hota he jisamen sipiu register, on-daai esaram druthika, bahya druthika, diram, prishthan pranali or ek hard drive kii abhaasi memory yaa gamagam sthaan shaamil hote hai
 This overall pool of memory may be referred to by many developers as "RAM", even RAM in different subsystems may have completely different access times, violating the basic concept beyond the random access noun
 ek padanukram str jaise diram ke antargat bhi vishesh pankti, kollam, bank, rank, channel, yaa ghatakon ke antavpatrit sanghathan abhigam samay ko parivartaneey bana dete hai haalanki is had tak nahin ki aavarti bhandaaran madhyam yaa tepe parivartaneey ho jaae
 memory padanukram ke prayog kaa samgr lakshya, sampoorn memory tantra kii kul laagat ko kam karte hue adhiktam sambhav ausat abhigam nishpaadan praapt karnaa he registeron or neeche dhime hard drive ke saath abhigam samay kaa anusaran karata he)
 In many modern personal computers, RAM comes in an intuitively advanced form of modules, called memory modules or dieram modules, and are roughly the same size as pieces of chewing gum
 jab ye kshatigrast ho jate hai yaa jab badalati hui aavashyaktaaon ke kaaran adhik bhandaaran kshamta kii jarurat padati he to inhen turant pratisthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 As suggested above, low-volume RAM) is integrated into hard-drives, cd-roms, and many other parts of the computer system, as well as cpus and other ics on the motherboard
 yadi koi computer teevr anuprayog chakra ke dauraan ram par dhimaa ho jaataa he to kai sipiu architekchar or oparating tantra, ek kaary nishpaadan main sakasham ho jate hai jise "gamagaman" ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Swapping uses a paging file that is an area of a hard drive used temporarily as additional working memory
 is kriyavidhi ke nirantar upyog ko thraishing kehete hai or aam taur par yah avaanchhneeya hoti he kyonki yah tantra ke sakal kaary-nishpaadan ko dhimaa kar detii he jiskaa mukhya kaaran yahi he ki ram kii tulana main hard drive adhik dhime hote hai
 Other physical devices that have read-write capability may use "RAM": for example, DVD-RAM
 An indexing method is also named "random access": that's why disk storage is often called "random Access is called " # File and Input / Output, Platform, Standard Edition # Random Access]], indexed file) because the read end can speed up from one part of data to another relatively quickly
 And does not need to read all of the above data
 haalanki, antim "M" mahatvapurn he: "ram" main hota he) hameshaa thos-avasthaa vaale upkaran ko sanderbhit karata he
 RAM is often a shorthand or short text of an online conversation in reference to the computer's main working memory
 software, kisi computer kii ram ke ek hisse kaa "vibhaajan" kar saktaa he or ise ek adhik tej hard drive ke rup main kaary karne kii anumati pradaan karata he jise ram discs kehete hai
 If the memory used is not non-volatile, the data stored in the RAM disk is lost when the computer is turned off
 haalanki, volatile memory apane data ko yathaavat rakh sakati he jab computer band ho jaataa he yadi iske paas ek alag shakti-strot, aam taur par ek bydaree ho
 Sometimes, ROM contents are copied to either ASRAM or DIRAM to achieve a relatively short access time
 The ROM chip is then deactivated when initialized memory locations are changed and installed in the same block of address
 commuter or ambeded pranali donon main is prakriya kaa aam taur par prayog kiya jaataa he jise kabhi-kabhi shadowing bhi kehete hai
 As a general example, typical personal computer bios often have an option called "use shadow bios" or a similar option
 sakriy kiye jane par bios ke rome ke data par aadhaarit prakaarya iske badale diram sthanon kaa upyog karegaa 
 sistar ke aadhaar par iske parinamswaroop kaary-nishpaadan main vruddhi ho bhi sakati he or nahin bhi ho sakati he
 In some systems the benefit may be hypothetical because bios are not used after booting in favor of direct hardware access
 beshak, jab shadowing ko sakriy rahata he tab kuch had tak kam mukt memory uplabdh rahati he
 Many new types of non-volatile RAM are under development which will keep the data safe even after the power supply is shut down

 The "memory wall" is the increasing contrast between the CPU and the memory located outside the CPU chip
 is vipareetata kaa ek mukhya kaaran, chip kii simaaon ke baahar kii simit sanchaar bandwidth he
 From the year 1986 to 2000, CPU speed improved at an annual rate of 55% while memory speed improved by only 10%
 in pravritiyon ko dekhte hue yah ummid thi ki memory vilambtaa computer ke kaary-nishpaadan main ek bahut badi rukawat ban jaaegi
 Currently, CPU speed improvements have been greatly reduced, in part due to major physical constraints and in part by the current CPU design already affecting the memory wall in some sense
 intel ne apane platform 2015 pralekhan ) main in kaarnon kaa sankshep main khulaasa kiya he
 "firstly, as the geometry of the chip is reduced and the clock frequencies increase, the leakage of the current transistor is increased resulting in increased power consumption and heat
 

 duusari baat yah he ki clock kii tej gati ke phaaydon ko kuch had tak memory vilambtaa dwaara nakaar diya gaya he kyonki memory abhigam samay, clock kii bad rahi aavritiyon ke saath talmail banaae rakhane main sakasham nahin hua he
 The third thing is that traditional serial architectures are becoming less efficient for some applications while the processors are speeding up and at the same time reducing the benefits so that frequency increases can be bought in another way 
 Additionally, to some extent due to the limitation in the means of producing the inductance under solid-state devices, resistance latency in signal transmission) is increasing as the feature sizes become smaller which is putting an additional bottleneck
 Which does not indicate an increase in frequency
 " The RC latency in signal transmission has also been recorded at the end of the path of the clock rate versus IPC: traditional microarchitecture, which estimates an average of 12
5% in annual CPU performance improvement between 2000 and 2014
