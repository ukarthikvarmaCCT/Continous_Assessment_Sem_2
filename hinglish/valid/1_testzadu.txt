 Centrifuge, or mathra, is generally called a device or machine in which the separation of substances of different density is done by the use of centrifugal force
 aajkal apkendrit kii uparyukt paribhaasha adhik vistrut ho gai he, jiske anusaar aisi kisi bhi mashin ko, jisaki rachana is vishesh prayojan se kii gai ho ki usamen padaarthon ko kendrabhimukh, apkendri bal ke satat prabhaav main rakhaa ja sake, apkendritra kaha jaataa he
 The separation of substances in the centrifuge is due to different densities
 apkendran se apkendri bal utpann hota he, jo gurutvkarshan bal ke samaan hota he
 The centripetal force can be used to accelerate many processes that usually rely on relatively small forces of gravity
 bharat tathaa anya deshon main apkendritra kaa upyog bahut samay se hota aayaa he
 The process of churning out curd and milk depends on the centripetal force
 kendrabhimukh bal kii vaigyanik paribhaasha newton ke bal tathaa gati ke prasiddh niyam par aadhaarit he
 According to Newton's law, in free state, moving materials have the tendency to walk in a straight line
 at: yadi is prakaar ke gatisheel padaarth ko vakr path par chalane ke liye sanchalit kiya jaae, to vah padaarth us sanchalit, athwa niyantrit karanevaale padaarth, athwa vastu ke vipareet bal prayukt karata he
 As a result, the moving material has a constant tendency to move in the direction of the tangent of that curvature
 udaahranarth, yah saamaanya anubhav main dekha jaataa he ki vrutt path main paribhraman karanevaali koi vastu paribhraman centre se dur balpreyas karti he
 This direction of balancing is towards the tangent path of the revolving circle
 at: paribhraman ke koniya veg, vastu, athwa padaarth ke bhaar, athwa vastu ke paribhramanvrutt ke ardhavyas, main vruddhi hone se apkendri bal main vruddhi hoti he
 The rotation of the centrifugal force is inversely proportional to the radius of the circle and the weight of the object, while it is proportional to the square of the angular velocity
 apkendratri ke prati minute ghurnan kii sankhya main duguni vruddhi hone se apkendri bal main chauguni vruddhi hoti hai
 Similarly, a tenfold increase in the speed of the centrifuge leads to a hundredfold increase in the centrifugal force
 apkendran kii kriya main kisi vastu par kaary karne, athwa prabhaav utpann karne, vaale apkendri bal kii, bahudhaa vastu kii taul se sidhe tulana kii jaati he
 On this basis, the centrifugal force is expressed as a multiple of gravity
 gurutv ke liye g akshar ko pratik mana jaataa he, at: apkendri bal ko sankshep main g ke gunaj main likhaa jaataa he
 If an object in a centrifuge is rotating at a speed of 600 rotations per minute and the radius of the rotation is 3
84 inches or 10 cm, the centrifugal force generated in this situation is 41 times the gravity
 aadhunik evam vishesh prakaar ke apkendrit main gurutv kaa lakh guna apkendri bal utpann kiya ja saktaa he
 The modern centrifuge metal is a vessel in which the rotating part is connected to the stationary axis of the current
 at: vidyunmotor ke chalane par apkendritra kaa ghurnan karanevaala bhaag bhi vidyunmotor kii gati se ghurnit hone lagata he
 The speed of rotation is the same as the rotation of the axis of the axis
 purv samay main apkendrit main ghurnan haath se utpann kiya jaataa tha
 Even nowadays, manual labor is used to rotate the centrifuge in domestic use
 aadhunik ati teevr gati se ghurnit honevaale upakendritra main vidyunmotor ke sthaan par vaayu tarabine kaa upyog hone laga he
 The rotating part of the centrifuge is called a rotor
 iskaa aakaar katori ke samaan, athwa ulte pyaale ke samaan hota he
 In this, the liquid or other object is kept in a centrifuge tube, or directly in the bowl, for centrifuge
 apkendran kaary main apakedritra main anaavashyak evam hanikar kampan utpann na ho, iske liye aavashyak hota he ki vastu se purit roter purna rup se santulit ho
 For this, the entire weight of the object has to be distributed evenly around the rotating axle
 adarsh paristhiti main is vyavastha se mul balon kaa parinami shunya ke baraabar hota he
 Centrifuge tendency is of particular importance in liquids, especially of liquids which have suspended microscopic particles of solids or in which the immiscible liquids or both are present
 thos padaarth ke sookshm kan, jal tathaa tel se bane paayas se teenon vastuon kaa pruthakkaran saralata se kiya ja saktaa he
 The force of gravity is very small compared to the centrifugal force produced in a centrifuge
 apkendri bal ke kshetra main, drav padaarth ghurnan aksh se adhik se adhik duuri par vipareet hone kaa praytn karata he, jisase drav apkendritra ke ghurnan paatr ke bahari kinaaren ke sameep samaan motaai main sthit ho jaataa he
 In this way, free space is spread uniformly from the axis to the fluid in the vessel, which is columnar
 is prakaar apkendran kii kriya ke dwaara nilambit karanevaale drav se apekshaakrit adhik ghanatvvaale, nilambit sookshmakan paribhraman paatr kii paridhi main ekatrit ho jate hai tathaa nilamban karanevaale drav se kam ghanatv ke nilambit sookshmakan paatr ke sthal par ekatrit ho jate hai
 How quickly the above separation will occur depends on the intensity of the centripetal force, the difference in density of the suspended fluid and suspended micro particles, the viscosity of the fluid, the size and magnitude of the suspended micro particles, and the concentration of the particles and the level of multiple electrical charges
 apkendritra ke anek audyogic upyog hai
 With this, not only the separation of various things, but also works like drying clothes are done
 apkendran bal ke upyog se pighali hui dhaatuon se vibhinn motaai ke pipon evam naliyon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Centrifuge is used in sugar factories to remove water from sugar crystals
 ammonium sulphate sadrush urvarak ke nirmaan main jal kii avaanchit maatra isi se nikaali jaati he
 Butter from milk is separated from the centrifuge
 aajkal audyogic kaarkaanon main nirantar pravaahvale apkendritron kaa upyog hota he jinamein pruthakkaran satat rup se chalata rahata he
 Centrifuge has become an indispensable tool in biology and chemistry laboratories
 chikitsa kshetra main atyant sookshm vishaanu evam anya jeevanuon ko apkendritra ke upyog se pruthak karnaa sambhav ho gaya he
 The use of ultra-fast rotating centrifuge in chemical analysis has made possible the speed of sedimentation of supernatant particles and sedimentation equilibrium
 saamanyat: 20,000 ghurnan prati minute se adhik ghurnan karanevaale apkendritron ko ultracentriphyus, yaa drut apkenditra, kehete hai
 Such centrifuge is of special importance in exploration works related to biology, medicine and chemistry

 naukari se santushti Job satisfaction refers to a person's attitude towards their job
 1)sanghathanaatmak karkon:paanch pramukh sanghathanaatmak ek karmchaaree ke ravaiye ke liye jo yogadan kaarak hai ve padonnati ke liye bhugtan karte hai, avasar, kaam kii prakruti, sanghathan or kaam kii paristhitiyon kii nitiyaan: 2) Working conditions: An employee's working conditions are consistent with physical comfort and that a good job contributes to job satisfaction
 taapmaana, ardrata, ventilation, prakaash vyavastha or shor, kaarysthal or paryaapt upkaran upkaran kaa kaam safai ke ghante kaam santosh ko prabhavit jo visheshtaayen hai
 3) Group Factors: The factors that influence group factors include group size and supervision
 aakaar: yah sach he ki samooh kii lambii aakaar, santushti ke str ko kam karti hai
 When size increases, there is opportunity for participation and a decrease in social relationships
 to samooh ke pradarshan ke saath kii pahchaan karne ke liye sadasyon kii kshamta ke rup main
 adhik sadasyon kaa matlab he samoohon ke bheetar kalah, sangharsh or samoohon
 Not auspicious sign for the satisfaction of all these members
 paryvekshan:paryvekshan ke kathith gunvattta naukari se santushti kaa ek or nirdharak he
 When satisfaction becomes high, people believe with their supervisors that they are more capable, have their best interests in mind, and treat them with dignity and respect
 sanchaar, paryvekshan kaa ek or pahalu he
 Members' satisfaction is high when they are able to communicate easily with their supervisor
 4)mazdooree: mazdooree naukari se santushti main ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa hai
 This is due to two reasons
 pehle paise ek kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye ek mahatvapurn saadhan he: or do, karmchaariyon ko aksar unke liye prabandhan kii chintaa kaa ek pratibimb ke rup main bhugtan dekhte hai
 Employees want a payment system that is simple, fair and with their expectations
 vetan naukari kii maang, vyaktigat kaushal str or samudaay vetan maanakon ke aadhaar par, uchit rup main dekha jaataa he, jab santosh parinaam kii sambhaavna he
 5) Promotions: Promotional opportunities affect job satisfaction
 yah jimmedaari, swatantraaa, sthiti or is tarah kaa bhugtan, naukari saamagree main badlaav shaamil he ke rup main badhaava dene ke liye ichha karmchaariyon ke bich aam taur par majboot he
 An average employee in a typical government organization has better promotion opportunities in the private sector, although they can expect to get two or three promotions throughout their service
 yah koi aashcharya kii baat he ki karmchaaree apane karier main param uplabdhi ke rup main padonnati letaa he or yah ehsaas ho rahaa he, vah behad santusht mahasoos karata he
 6) Nature of work: Most employees want intellectual challenges on jobs
 in visheshtaon naukari maansik rup se chunauteepurn bana
 Very less challenging jobs create boredom
 lekin chunauti hataasha or vifaltaa kii bhaavana paidaa karata he
 Moderate challenge on conditions makes employees feel happy and content
 7)sanghathanaatmak nitiyon or prakriyaaon: sanghathanaatmak nitiyon prabhavi padonnati, logon ke hastantaran ke liye mul baaten shaamil hai, videshi kaary, chantni or puraskaar pranali, prerak tareekon, naukari aadhaarit vetan banaam kaushal aadhaarit, band karnaa
 1) Productivity: The relationship between satisfaction and productivity is certainly not established
 haalanki lambey samay kii naukari se santushti vruddhi hui utpaadakta kii ore jaataa he
 On the other hand job satisfaction from performance of work is true and there is no other round
 jo karmchaaree apni kaam acchhee tarah se karata he usko donon aantarik or bahya puraskaar miltaa he jo apni santushti ke liye netritv karegaa
 a bad performer would feel bad about his ability and receive fewer awards
 vah apane kaam ke anubhav ke saath kam santusht ho jayega
 However there are certain conditions under which higher productivity leads to job satisfaction more clearly
 ek shart karmchaariyon aantarik or bahya puraskaar unki utpaadakta par dal kar rahe hai vyapti main duusari shart bahya puraskaar samaan rup se vitarit kiya ja rahaa he
 Unequal distribution fails to convince the employee about the close relationship between hard work and rewards
 2)naukari se santushti or karmchaaree kaarobaar : ucch karmchaaree kaarobaar niyoktaaon ke liye kaaphi chintaa kaa vishay he kyonki yah saamaanya kaaryon ko baadhit karata he un logon ke liye manobal samasyaon kaa kaaran banataa he or chayan or pratisthaapan prashikshan main shaamil laagat bad jaati he
 The employer tries to make employees feel satisfied at their jobs to reduce turnover
 pradarshan kiya gaya he kii jo shramikon ko apekshaakrit nimna str naukari se santushti paaya jaataa he ve apni naukari chhodane ke liye sabase adhik sambhaavna he
 Although the return behavior of employees is modified by some factors
 sanghathan main vafadari aisi ek he
 How dissatisfied some employees may be, cannot imagine themselves working elsewhere
 3)santushti or anupasthiti : anupasthiti ko santushti ke sahasambandh bhi nirnaayak sabit ho gaya he
 Workers who are dissatisfied are likely to take "mental health" days because of illness or personal occupation
 santushti kam he jab anupasthiti adhik he
 The degree to which people feel that their jobs are important has a mediating effect on their absence
 apane kaam ke liye mahatvapurn he jo lagata he ki karmchaariyon ghadi niyamit upasthiti ke liye karte hai
 It is important to remember that satisfaction while doing high jobs will not necessarily result in low absenteeism
 In addition, low satisfaction is likely to bring about high absenteeism
 4)santushti or suraksha: garib suraksha prathaon kam santushti ke str ke ek nakaaratmak parinaam hai
 When people get frustrated with their job union or supervisors when they are more liable to experience accidents
 aisi durghatnaon ke liye ek antarnihit kaaran niraashaa he
 If the operator is not careful, he may suffer multiple hands
 5)santushti or naukari tanaav: naukari tanaav sharir kii pratikriya he jo kisi bhi kaam sambandhit kaarak vyaktiyon santulan ko pareshaan karne ke liye dhamkata he
 In this process of coping with stress, employees change state within
 lambey samay tak tanaav se karmchaaree main gambhir bimariyon kaa kaaran ban saktaa he jaise kii hriday rog, ulcer duuradrushti, peeth ke nichle hisse main dard or mansapeshiyon main dard
 Chronic job dissatisfaction is a powerful source of job stress
 ve tanaav ke is prakaar se bachane ke liye koi santoshjanak alpakaalik samaadhaan nahin dekh sakate hai

 As of 2009, it was reported that the Indian government was not considering development of an intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of 10,000 km or more
 ek lambii duuri antaramahadwipiya belistic missile ke liye ek kaarykram kii atakaley 2011 main phir shuru ho gai
 Some reports have claimed that the intercontinental ballistic missile is already named "surya" and the name code Agni-6
 anya reporton se bataaya diya gaya ki nai dilli antaramahadwipiya belistic kii aavashyaktaa ke liye gambhir nahin he
 DRDO can initiate a project to develop India's intercontinental ballistic missile only after permission from the Government of India
 chunki bharat 27 june 2016 tak missile praudyogiki niyantran vyavastha kaa hastaksharkarta nahin tha
 So the Indian missile program was not limited by any treaty commitment to the development of intercontinental ballistic missile capability
 kuch media reporton ne kabhi-kabhi bataaya tha ki bharat emticiar ke liye ek gaiyr-hastaksharkarta hone ke kaaran 5000 kilometre kii seemaa se pare mixilon ke vikaas par ek svaichhik adhisthgan he
 The missile technology control system does not prevent India from developing missiles beyond 5,000 km
 emticiar ek alag rajya ke liye missile praudyogiki ke hastantaran ko roktaa he jisase missile praudyogiki prasar naa bade
 The treaty does not differentiate between MTCR signatories and non-mtcr signatories regarding the transfer or component of technology
 missile praudyogiki niyantran vyavastha sandhi kaa hastaksharkarta desh kisi dusre desh ko missile praudyogiki nahin de saktaa he
 However, there is a legal argument that transferring missile technology to a signatory country of a missile technology control regime is not considered a dissemination

 Breaking out of the regional context is important as the country's sphere of influence increases
 kisi bhi desh par hamaare paas koi kshetreey dizin nahin he
 But India needs its own sphere of influence
 " In October 2011, a report published by The Pioneer doubted the drdo's ability to independently develop "seeker technology" for icbms, using technology only to allow the missile to reach more than 10,000 kilometers
 isi report ne bharat ko "sadhak praudyogiki" main sahaayat pradaan karne kii rus kii ichha par jor diya
 The authenticity of this report is disputed by at least one foreign newspaper, making counter-claims that Russia's involvement is unlikely, because if the report about Russian involvement is true, Russia has violated the missile technology control system 
 jo rus itani aasaani se nahin kar saktaa he
 It is a member country of the Missile Technology Control Regime

 As a result of the revolution, the king was removed from the throne, a republic was established, bloody conflicts took place, and finally the dictatorship of Napoleon was established, which spread many values of this revolution in and outside Western Europe
 is kranti ne aadhunik itihaas kii disha badal di
 This led to the decline of the absolute monarchy around the world, new republics and liberal democracies
 aadhunik yug main jin mahaparivartanon ne paashchaatya sabhyataa ko hilaa diya usamen france kii rajyakranti sarvaadhik naatakeey or jatil sabit hui
 This revolution disrupted the life of not only France but the whole of Europe

 This revolution also led to freedom in other European countries and other countries also started fighting for freedom from the monarchy
 isane europea rashtron sahit asian deshon main rajshahi or nirankushta ke khilaaf vaataavaran taiyaar kiya
 France had an autocratic monarchy based on the divine principle of kingship
 isamen raja ko aseemit adhikaar praapt the or raja swechhachari tha
 In the reign of Louis the 14th, autocracy was at its zenith
 usne kaha- "main hi rajya hoon"
 He made laws against his will
 usne shakti kaa atyadhik kendriyakaran rajtantr ke paksh main kar diya
 France expanded by diplomacy and military prowess
 is tarah usne rajtantr ko gambhir pesha banaaya
 The governance that Louis 14th centralized required a worthy king, but his successors Louis 15th and Louis 16th were completely inept
 lui 15waan atyant vilaasi, adoordarshee or niskriy shaasha tha
 Participated in Austria's succession war and the Seven Year War caused great damage to the country's economic condition

 He said that "this thing is legal because i want it
" " apane ek mantri ke tyaagptr ke samay usne kaha ki-kaash! main bhi tyaagptr de paata
 His wife Mary Antoniet had a great influence on him
 vah phijulkharchi karti thi
 He had no understanding of the troubles of the common man
 ek baar jab logon kaa juluus roti kii maang kar rahaa tha to usne salaah di ki yadi roti uplabdh nahin he to log kek kyon nahin khate
 In this way the governance system of the country was completely dependent on bureaucracy
 jo vanshanugat thi
 There were no rules for their recruitment and training and there was no institution that could control these bureaucrats
 is tarah shashan pranali puri tarah bhrasht, nirankush, niskriy or shoshankari thi
 The law of personal law and the will of the king applied

 Due to this chaotic and complicated law, the public did not have knowledge of their own law

 These oppressive political circumstances gave way to revolution

 " kranti ke kaarnon ko saamaajik paristhitiyon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 French society was heterogeneous and disintegrated
 vah samaaj teen virgon / stats main vibhakt tha
 The clergy in the first states, the nobility in the second states and the general public in the third states
 padri evam kuleen varg ko vyapak visheshadhikaar praapt tha jabaki jansadharan adhikaar viheen tha
 The number of farmers was the highest and their condition was low and thoughtful
 kisaanon ko rajya, carch tathaa anya jamidaaron ko anek prakaar ke kar dene padate the or saamanti atyaachaari ko sahanaa padataa tha
 In a sense, the main reason for the dissatisfaction of the farmers was the hardships and inconveniences being given by the feudal lords and the monarchy was silent on it
 is tarah kisaan itane duhkhi ho chuke the ki ve swayan hi ek krantikari tatv ke rup main parinat ho gaye or unhen kranti karne ke liye maatr ek sanket kii aavashyaktaa thi
 The middle class consisted of moneylender merchants, teachers, lawyers, doctors, writers, artists, employees etc
 unki aarthik dasha main avashya thik thi phir bhi ve tatkaaleen raajnneetik, saamaajik or aarthik paristhitiyon ke prati acroshit the
 This class had no political authority and the behavior of the clergy and the nobility was not good towards them
 is kaaran madhyavarg kulinon ke saamaajik shreshthata se ghrinaa rakhte tha or raajnneetik vyavastha main parivartan kar apane adhikaron ko praapt karne ke icchhuk tha
 This was the reason that he was the main contributor to the French Revolution and he led the revolution
 madhyavarg ke kuch aarthik shikaayatein bhi thi
 Due to the erstwhile commerce trade, this class had acquired wealth, but now in the feudal environment, there were many restrictions on their trade and had to pay tax in place
 ve apane vyapaar vyavsaay ke liye unmukt vaataavaran chaahate the
 For this, he led the revolution
 is tarah ham kah sakate hai ki france kii kranti francisi samaaj ke do paraspar virdohi guton ke sangharsh kaa parinaam thi
 On the one hand there were influential groups from the political point of view and on the other side from the economic point of view
 desh kii raajnneeti or sarkaar par prabhutv kaayam karne ke liye in donon virgon main sangharsh anivaary tha
 Thus the French Revolution of 1789 was a struggle against inequality in French society
 france kii aarthik avasthaa sankatagrast thi
 The state was on the verge of bankruptcy
 vastutah france ke raajaaon kii phijulkharchi tathaa lui 14wein ke lagaataar yudhon ke kaaran shahi kosh khaali ho gaya tha
 After his death, Louis 15th participated in the Austrian succession war and the Seven Year War, which further increased the burden on the treasury and eventually Louis 16th made France's economic condition worse by participating in the American War of Independence

 The palace of Versailles became a means of looting the treasury

 Due to privileges, the rich class was exempt from tax and the poor farmer who was economically poor was the only taxpayer
 is tarah rajkosh kii sthiti atyant sochneey ho gai thi
 In France, the government fixed income according to expenditure rather than spending according to income
 rajya rin ke boj tale dabta gaya
 Whether France was unable to pay the interest of the principal money means that the state had reached a state of bankruptcy
 desh kii aarthik durvyavastha ko vyapaar vaanijya ko protsaahan dekar sudhara ja saktaa tha parantu sarkaar kii vaanijya niti itani aniyantrit evam doshapurn thi ki usase rajya main utpaadan evam vyapaar kaa vikaas sambhav nahin tha
 Louis 16th tried to overcome the economic crisis through financial advisors like the Turks, Necker but these reform efforts could not be implemented because the privileged class did not accept the taxation on themselves

 In the context of the role of philosophers in the French Revolution, two opinions emerge - one, the philosophers created the revolution by giving rise to the circumstances of the revolution and secondly the source of the revolution was in the faults of the national life of that time and in the mistakes of the government and The philosophers did not produce a revolution
 kisi bhi mat par nirnay dene ke purv un darshanikon ke vichaaron or kranti ke saath unke sambandhon ko samajhnaa vaanchhneeya hoga
 The determination of the popularity of the ideas of philosophers should be seen on the basis of the volumes and prevalence of the articles printed at that time
 montescue ne apni pustak 'da spirit of loj' main raja ke daivi adhikaron ke siddhanton kaa khandan kiya or francisi raajnneetik sansthaaon kii aalochana hi nahin ki varan vikalp bhi prastut kiya
 He wrote that the French government is an autocratic government because in France all the powers related to executive, judiciary and legislature are concentrated in the hands of one person ie the king, so the French people do not have freedom
 isi sadanrbh main usne “shakti ke pruthakkaran” kaa siddhanth diya jiske anusaar shashan ke teen pramukh ang-karypalika, nyaaypalik or vyavasthapika ko alag-alag haathon main rakhane kii salaah di
 He described the Government of England as ideal because there was a constitutional monarchy whereby the citizens were at liberty there
 is prakaar montescue ne shakti ke pruthakkaran ke madhyam se france kii nirankush raaj vyavastha par chot kii uske ye vichaar itane lokapriy hue ki 'da spirit of laaj' ke teen varshon main chah sanskaran prakashit hue
 It is to be noted here that Montescue neither talked of revolution nor the abolition of the monarchy, he just exposed the faults of autocratic monarchy and talked about constitutional monarchy

 These books became very popular before being banned
 “waltare” ne carch ke bhrasht achaaran, ashishnutaa, anyaay, daman or atyaachaar ke virodh main likhaa
 Pointing fingers at the corruption of the church, he wrote that there is no Christian left because there was only one Christian and he was crucified
 usne likhaa ki kukhyat evam badnaam cheez ko kuchal do
 This was clearly an attack on the tyrannical monarchy of France and the tyranny of the Church
 waltare england ke sanvaidhanik rajtantr ke anuroop hi france main bhi vaisaa hi shashan sthapit karnaa chahta tha
 He said that i prefer the rule of one lion in place of hundred mice

 The people who have been entrusted with executive power are the executive, not the owner of the people, and their duty is to obey the orders of the people

 nepolian ne uske mahatv ko sweekaar karte hue kaha ki yadi ruson nahin hota to france main kranti nahin hoti
 The popularity of the Russian social contract can be gauged from the fact that 13 editions were published in a year

 The nobles hoped that in this meeting they would be able to obtain the privileges which were taken away at the time of Louis 14th
 madhyavarg ke logon kaa manaan tha ki ve apane paksh main pragatisheel nitiyon kaa nirdhaaran karvaa sakenge
 The farmers hoped that by raising their voice against feudal privileges, they would be able to secure their rights and be free from their exploitation cycle
 is tarah francisi rajtantr kaa samarthan karne ke liye francisi jansankhya kaa koi mahatvapurn bhaag taiyaar nahin tha
 In the session of the Estates General, there was a dispute between the third state and other states on the issue of voting system
 matdaan ke bare main kaha gaya ki prayek state kaa ek hi mat mana jayega
 In this way, the privileged class has two and the public has only one opinion
 jansadharan ke pratinidhiyon ne arthath 'tritiy state' ne is matdaan pranali kaa virodh kiya kyonki isse ve bahut main hote hue bhi alpamat main aa jate
 The third state wanted the representatives of the three categories to sit together and decide by majority, but the clergy and the elite wanted separate meetings
 atah tritiy state ne stats general kii baithak kaa bahishkaar kar apane ko samast raashtra kaa pratinidhi maanate hue rashtriya sabha ke rup main ghoshit kar diya or paas ke tennis court main apni sabha bulaai
 The French Revolution reached its end through various stages
 adhyayan kii suvidha kii drushti se kranti ko nimnlikhit chaar charnon main baantkar dekha ja saktaa he
 At this stage the Parisian mob established control of the Bastille fort
 is tarah kranti kii shuruuaat hui
 In fact, the Bastille fort was a symbol of tyranny and tyranny and its fall posed a deep challenge to the archaic system
 is ghatana kaa prabhaav france ke gramin kshetron main bhi padaa or graminon ne saamanti karon ke abhilekhon ko aag laga di
 These proceedings of the public also had a profound impact on the National Assembly
 atah 4 agast 1789 jo raat bhar kaa rashtriya sabha kaa adhiveshan chalaa jisamen kanoon nirmit karke sabhi visheshadhikaron ko samaapt kar diya
 Thus England and America were abolished
 rashtriya sabha kaa mahatvapurn kaary tha- ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan karnaa
 Therefore, the National Assembly was called the Constituent Assembly and on 26 August 1789, the Constituent Assembly declared human rights
 samvidhan sabha ne apane aadarshon tathaa uddeshyon ke rup main maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 This declaration emphasized the principle of equality and it was said that since all human beings are born equal, they should get equal rights
 in adhikaron main swatantraaa, sampatti suraksha tathaa atyaachaar ke virodh kaa adhikaar aadi shaamil the
 In this way, the Constituent Assembly declared the fundamental principles, freedom, equality and dominance of the people
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko ghoshnaa patr main baar-baar duharaaya gaya
 No one could be denied this right
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne carch kii sampatti ko jabt kar liya or janata par carch ke niyantran ko kam karne kaa prayaas kiya
 In this context, the Church was brought under the Kingdom and was transformed from the influence of the Pope of Rome into a National Church
 rajya ke prati padariyon kii vafadari surakshit karne ke liye "civil constichution of cllerji" banaaya gaya
 According to which the priests had to take an oath of allegiance to the state and they were elected by the public
 pope or kuch padariyon ne is kadam kaa virodh kiya
 The clergy who swore allegiance to the state were called "jurors" while those who did not take the oath were called "non-jurors"
 is kanoon se kranti ke viruddh ek maahaul nirmit hone laga kyonki abhi tak chote padariyon ne kranti kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Now they broke away from it and some clergy left the country and went abroad and started campaigning against the revolution in Europe there
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne france ke liye likhit sanvadhin taiyaar kiya or is samvidhan ko 1791 main lui solahaven ne apni sweekruti de di
 The Constitution emphasizes two things - one, the sovereign power of the state is vested in the people and second, the separation of power is in the interest of the state and the people
 yadhyapi shashan pranali rajtantratmak bani raheen parantu raja ke adhikaron ko simit kiya gaya
 He is no longer a lawmaker
 raja ko kisi desh se yuddh yaa sandhi karne kaa adhikaar nahin tha
 The authority to legislate was given to an assembly and its members numbered 745
 vyavasthapika ke sadasyon ke nirvachan ke liye nagarikon ko sakriy or nishkray do bhaagon main vibhakt kar diya gaya or matadhikaar keval sakriy nagarikon ko diya gaya
 Active citizens were those over the age of 25 who paid the state direct tax equal to three days' income while inactive citizens were those who were poor
 rashtriya sabha ne france kii prashasnic sanrachana main parivartan kiya
 The entire country was divided into 83 departments by abolishing the ancient provinces

 There was an Election Council to run the rule of each of the units, which were elected by active citizens
 is tarah sthaneey str se lekar kendriya str tak sari rajya vyavastha bargea varg main aa gai
 After the dissolution of the National Assembly, in 1791 AD, a 745-member administrative body came into existence
 is vyavasthapika sabha main adhyaksh ke daahine haath kii ore baithne vaale 'dakshinpanthi' kehalaae
 These people were orthodox and supportive of the monarchy, while those on the left were called 'leftists' and this group was of the original changeists who were radical and revolutionary
 radicals bhi do virgon main bante the- jirondist or doosraa jacobiyan
 Meanwhile, the fear of the French Revolution started spreading to other countries of Europe
 jo padri evam kuleen varg france se bhaag europe ke anya kshetron ke chale gaye the unhone kranti ke viruddh bhaavana failaai
 On the other hand, French revolutionaries wanted to propagate revolutionary principles in other countries as well
 faltah europe ke anya raja shankit hue
 As a result, the relations between revolutionary France and other countries of Europe deteriorated
 austria ne krantikariyon ke manaa karne par bhi france ke rajtantr ke samarthak sharnaarthiyon ko apane yahaan rahane diya tha
 Therefore, in April 1792, the Legislative Assembly declared war against Austria, but the French army was badly defeated
 is paraajay se france kii janata ko vishwaas ho gaya ki raja ne austria ko france kii sainya shakti or suraksha ke saare bhed bataa die hai
 Hence the public's attitude towards the king became fierce
 in sthitiyon main francisi rajtantr ke samarthan main prasha or austria ne ghoshnaa kii ki france kii janata raja kii ajna kaa paalan kare anyathaa ham unke viruddh kaarywahi karenge
 In this way the French Revolution created a war situation in Europe
 is ghoshnaa se france kii janata or ugr ho gai or usne raja ko gher liya
 The king escaped and took refuge in the assembly
 ab yah vichaar kiya jane laga ki vyavasthapika sabha bhang kii jaae; punah chunaav ho, nayi vyavasthapika sabha bane or vah rajtantr ke bhavishya par apana nirnay de
 With this, the assembly was abolished and a national convention was formed on the basis of adult suffrage
 21 sintabar 1792 ko neshnal kanveshan kaa pratham adhiveshan hua
 The Jacobian and Jirodist parties were prominent in this
 jacobiyan anushaasit or sangathit the
 He had influence on the Parisian crowd
 isamen pramukh netaa the- dante, robspier, heater aadi
 On the other side there were jirondists - these were educated and cultured people
 inhen kitaabi gyaan adhik tha
 As a result, they were not practical politicians
 pramukh netaa the- isnar, madam rolland, briso aadi
 It is to be understood here that both factions were advocates of the Republic, supporting the war against foreign powers
 antar keval swaroop kaa tha
 In fact, Jirodisto took a liberal position in France
 unka maananaa tha kii kranti bahut aage ja chuki he or uskaa ant hona chahie
 They were against bringing more social equality
 ve swatantraaa par adhik jor dete the
 On the other hand, the Jacobians emphasized more on equality and had a harmonious attitude towards the lower classes
 neshnal kanvension ke saamne teen pramukh samasyaayein thi- videshi akraman, raja kii maujuudagi or grihayuddh
 In September 1792, the French army occupied Belgium and in the south Nees and Savoy also came under its control
 in vijayon se holland, austria, prasha or england ghabara gaye
 The revolutionaries also declared in 1792 that the Republic of France was based on feelings of freedom, equality and fraternity, and it was their duty to spread these feelings
 france jin jagahon par aadhipatay kaayam karegaa vahaan krantikari siddhanton ko lagu karegaa or padariyon or kulinon kii sampatti chin legaa or jo bhi desh iskaa virodh karegaa use kranti kaa shutra samaj jayega
 The autocratic monarchy countries of Europe were frightened by this announcement and now the revolution of France turned to the whole of Europe, not France
 atah europea desh kranti ke prasar ko rokane ke liye ekajute ho gaye or england, holland, austria, prasha ke ek gut kaa france ke viruddh nirmaan hua
 This group defeated France in many places
 faltah videshi yuddh main france kii paraajay neshnal kanveshan ke samaksh ek mukhya samasya ban gai
 The National Convention passed a resolution that abolished the monarchy and established the republic
 raja par deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya gaya or mrityudand kii sajaa di gai
 The policy of the Jirendistas on the question of the slaughter of the king was not clear
 ve rajtantr ke virdohi to the lekin vadh ke prashn par janamat sangrah kii baat kar rahe the
 In contrast, the Jacobians believed that the king's treason had been proved
 atah use mrityudand diya janaa chahie
 Finally, on 16 January 1793, Louis 16th was hanged
 neshnal kanvension ko jacobiyan or jirodishton ke bich sangharsh kii samasya kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa
 In fact, France was beset by an economic crisis due to war, with prices soaring that the Convention enacted legislation to provide relief, a rule to collect debt from the rich
 in kadamon kaa jirondixton ne virodh kiya
 When Jacobio invaded the Convention with the help of the Paris mob and the commune, he took power and arrested Jirondisto and established a state of terror
 'aatank ke rajya' kii sthapana ke saath hi france ek baar punah avyavashtha kaa shikaar hua
 It was founded under the leadership of Robspier
 isamen krantikari, jansuraksha kii sthapana kii gai thi or jo koi jaikabins ke viruddh kaam karata use mrityudand kii sajaa di jaati
 Robespierre was influenced by the ideology of the Russians
 jiske anusaar “saamaanya ichha” hi saarvbhaumik ichha he
 Robespierre put opponents on the "guillotine" to control power
 atah sabhi vyakti apane jivan ko lekar sashankit ho uthe
 Finally in July 1794, Robespierre was imprisoned and hanged, ending the reign of Terror
 aantak ke rajya ke baad 'thermidorian kii pratikriya' hui
 Liberal Thermidorian leaders took over the power of the country and dissolved the militant state systems, declaring the Jacobians illegal
 aantak ke shashan ke dauraan lagaae gaye mulya tathaa paarishramik par se niyantran uthaa liya gaya
 Due to which the prices rose again, the influence of speculators increased and the rebellions in response, but these rebels were suppressed
 tritiy charan-1794-99 -“diarectory” kaa shashan vastutah neshnal kanvension ne ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan kar karypalika kaa uttardaayitv 5 sadasyeey “nideshak mandal” ko saunpa
 The rights of all the members of the board were equal
 prayek sadsy baari-baari se teen maheene ke liye adhyaksh hua karte the
 Each year a member term was to end and another member was to be appointed instead
 is tarah neshnal kanvension ke baad france main diarectory kaa shashan shuru hua jo 1795 se 1799 tak chalaa
 Hence, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule
 diarectory kaa yah shashan avyavasthit, dukhamay rahaa
 The Board of Directors was empowered to control the Armed Forces and to appoint Chiefs of Army, to make treaties or to wage war on behalf of France
 sanchaalak mandal ke saamne sabase pramukh samasya thi yuddh kii samasya, duusari taraf diarectory ke sadsy anubhavheen, ayogy tathaa bhrasht the
 Therefore, during the rule of the directory, various kinds of disturbances spread, unemployment increased, trade was halted and its foreign policy was also weak
 aisi sthiti main france kii janata ek aise shaasha kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kar rahi thi jo desh ke andar or baahar shanti sthapit kar sake tathaa videshi shaktiyon ko parrast kar sake
 During this period Napoleon established the honor of France by military victories and eventually ended the rule of the Directory and established control of power
 1799 main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kiya or france kaa pratham counsal bana or 1804 i
 main usne apane ko samraat ghoshit kar diya or is tarah nepolian ke taanaashaahee samrajyavaadee shashan kii shuruuaat hui
 France is the only country in Europe that has ensured the collapse of the archaic system through revolution
 is kranti kaa prabhaav europe tak hi simit na rahaa
 It affected the whole world
 kranti ke naare swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kaa prasar puure europe main hua
 On the one hand, while it gave opportunity to new powers like nationalism, democraticism to flourish, on the other hand it also laid the foundation of modern dictatorship and militarism
 francisi kranti ke prabhaavon ko nimna binduon ke tahat samajha ja saktaa haih The nature of the French Revolution needs to be understood in light of the ideals of the revolution, the leadership of the revolution, the progress of the revolution, the changes brought during the revolution and the effects on the world
 is drushti se kranti ek aisi kranti thi jiskaa prarambh to kuleen varg ne kiya, phir aage chalakar iskaa netritv madhyavarg ke haathon main aayaa
 It remained under the influence of revolutionary elements for some time and ended with a military dictator
 is tarah francisi kranti us vishaal nadi kii tarah jo ucch parvat shikhar se prarambh hokar maarg main anek chote-mote parvaton ko laanghti hui kabhi teevr gati se, to mand gati se pravaahman rahi
 The French Revolution of 1789 can be seen as a bourgeois revolution
 kranti ke pratham charan main netritv tritiy state ke burjuai tatwon ke haathon main tha
 The middle class leadership should also formulate some principles keeping in mind personal property
 vastutah samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa to kar di gai kintu saamanti adhikaron ko yun hi nahin chhod diya gaya, balki bhumipatiyon kii kshatipurti karne ke baad hi kisaan kisi uttardaayitv se mukt ho sakate the
 Middle class influence can be seen in the Declaration of Human Rights
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko manushya ke naiysargik adhikaron kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya jo burjua hiton ke sangrakshan se sambandhit he
 Similarly, adult suffrage was talked about, but in the Constitution the word "citizen" was used in a very narrow sense
 naagarik ko sakriy va niskriy nagarikon main vibhajit kiya gaya
 Active citizens were those who paid at least three days' income as direct taxes and only had the right to vote
 pratinidhi hone ke liye bhi sampatti kii yogyata ko aadhaar banaaya gaya or yah dhani log hi raajnneetik kriyakalapon main bhaag le sakate the or iskaa matlab tha ki dhani log madhyavarg se jude the
 In this way, the French Revolution destroyed the discrimination based on birth, but was replaced by the new feudalism based on wealth instead of ancient feudalism
 kranti ke dauraan krantikariyon ne nirankush sarkaar dwaara liye gaye rinon kii baat to kii kintu un rinon ko maaf karne kii baat kisi ne nahin kii
 The reason was that this loan was given to the government by the bourgeoisie
 isi prakaar sarkaar ne carch kii sampatti ko to jabt kiya parantu use bhoomihinon ko nahin baanta gaya
 The lands were sold at the highest prices and the middle class had the ability to buy this land
 francisi kranti ne mazdooron ke hiton ko najrandaaj kiya or shramik andolan ko hatotsahit kiya
 The working class played an important role during the revolution, but the bourgeois leadership did not approve of its growing position
 atah neshnal asembli ne nirankush rajtantr yug main nirmit kanoonon ko punah lagu kar diya
 Due to which all trade union related works were banned and guilds were declared illegal
 neshnal essembali main burjuaon kii pradhanta thi or usamen jirondist or jacobiyan bhi burjua varg se sambandhit the
 Although the Jacobians spoke of the interests of the proletariat, the establishment of a state of terror kept bourgeois interests above and army's help was taken to suppress the workers' reactions
 diarectory ke shashan main bhi madhyavargeey hiton ko pramukhataa di gai
 All members of the bicameral legislature that the governing board created were middle-class intellectuals
 nepolian ke sudhaaron par bhi burjuai prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 He protected the right to property in his code of law, preserving bourgeois interests, giving relatively broad rights to the nobles and the middle class benefited from its commercial and commercial reforms
 is tarah kranti ke swaroop main madhyavargeey tatv dikhaai dete hai
 But from the analysis of the entire revolution and its impact, it is clear that in the revolution there was co-existence of farmers, laborers, women with middle class elements
 is tareeke se yah maatr madhyavargeey kranti nahin thi apitu ek lokapriy kranti ke rup main ise dekha ja saktaa he
 The French Revolution took on a worldwide character
 krantikariyon ne 1789 main manushya tathaa naagarik adhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii, jiske tahat kaha gaya ki janm se samaan paidaa hone ke kaaran sabhi manushyon ko samaan adhikaar milanaa chahie or yah sabhi deshon ke liye sabhi manushyon ke liye, sabhi samay ke liye or udhaaharan swaroop sari duniya ke liye hai
 This declaration was made not just for France but for the good of all people everywhere who wanted to be independent and to be free from the burden of autocratic monarchy and feudal privileges
 neshnal essembali dwaara 1792 i
 main compene naamak angeraj nayak ko francisi naagarik kii oopaadhi di gai or use neshnal kanvension kaa pratinidh bhi chunaa gaya
 Similarly, during the revolution, the idea was to expand the revolution to other countries of Europe to keep it stable and strong
 isamen ek aise yuddh kii kalpana kii gai jisamen francisi senaayen padosi deshon main pravesh kar vahaan ke sthaneey krantikariyon se milakar rajtantr ko apdasth kar ganatantron kii sthapana karti he
 The French Revolution was not just a national event, but the whole Europe resonated with the principles - slogans of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke prabhaav itane doorgaami rahe ki samast europe isse aachhadit hua
 It was said in this context that "if France has a cold, then all of Europe sneezes
" ” The French Revolution was not as well planned as the Russian Revolution
 vastutah roosi kranti bolshevikon dwaara suniyojit thi or uskaa uddeshy satta hasil kar sarvhaara kaa shashan sthapit karnaa tha lekin francisi kranti shuru se ant tak ghatnaon or paristhitiyon kaa shikaar raheen or ghatnaayen is tarah se nahin ghati jis tarah se krantikariyon ne chaha balki ghatnaon ne krantikariyon ko apana rasta badalane ke liye majaboor kiya
 If the other states had accepted the third state in the meeting of the States General, the trend of revolution would have been second
 isi prakaar aatank kaa rajya or diarectory ke shashan bhi suniyojit dhang se nahin chale
 From this point of view this revolution was chaotic
 francisi kranti ke mul main tatkaaleen francisi samaaj kii duravastha bhi ek mahatvapurn kaarak thi
 The whole society was divided into privileged and unprivileged classes
 krishakon kii sthiti karon ke boj se kharaab thi to duusari taraf unhen saamanton ke atyaachaar tathaa carch ke hastkshep se bhi shoshan kaa shikaar hona padataa tha
 These conditions led the revolution and the revolutionaries raised their voice against this inequality and gave the slogan of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke dauraan hi samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa hui, visheshadhikaron ko khatm kiya gaya
 The general public had participated in the French Revolution, but by ignoring their interests, the revolution took the form of totalitarianism in which the principles and wishes of any one person dominated
 vastutah kranti ke dauraan robspier ke netritv main ek taanaashaahee sarkaar yaa adhinayakatantr kii sthapana hui thi or aage chalakar nepalian ne bhi adhinayakatantr kii sthapana kii
 The French Revolution was a strong reaction against all the distortions, inconsistencies and fundamental faults prevailing in the ancient system
 kranti ne nirankush rajtantr asamanta par aadhaarit francisi samaaj, vilasitapurna padri varg tathaa aarthik diwaaliyepan ke sankat se jujh rahe kushasan kaa ant kar france main prajatantric shashan pranali kaa maarg prashast kiya
 From this point of view, it can be seen as a progressive revolution
 itnaa hi nahin maanavdhikaron kii ghoshnaa swatantraaa, samanta va bandhutav ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ko avgat karaayaa parinamswaroop vishwa ke kai deshon main raajnneetik adhikaron kii maang ko lekar janandolan hone lage
 The spirit of unification of Italy and Germany was encouraged
 dharm or raajnneeti ke pruthakkaran kaa mudda pehali baar is kranti ke dauraan uthaa
 State and politics were separated from religion
 vishwa itihaas main france kii rajya kranti ko vishisht mahatv praapt he yah maanav itihaas kii ek mahatvapurn ghatana maani jaati he
 In this, not only France, but also brought a priceless change in the life of Europe, in this, by destroying the feudal system that had been prevailing in the past, it gave way to modern democratic system
 rajtantr kii nirankushta samaapt hui or loktantric vaataavarna main logon ne chaiyn kii saans lee
 At this time, the question arises in front of us why the revolution in 1789 AD was not in other European countries but in France first
 18 veen shatabdi ke europe rashtron kaa adhyayan karne se gyaat hota he ki us samay france kii jo sthiti thi usase bhi badtar anya europe rashtron kii thi
 The autocratic monarchy was weighed down by the class with ease and the unbearable burden of taxes
 saadhaaran varg praaia: sabhi europe deshon main maujud the
 The condition of some states was more distorted than France, Prasha, Austria and Russia etc
 were also more distorted than France
 francisi krishak anya europe rashtron kii apeksha khushaal the
 The condition of the ordinary class was worse in other European states
 phir bhi kranti in deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi hui
 The main reason for this was that the French people were aware of their situation
 kranti ke liye yah koi aavashyak shart nahin ki iskaa visphot usee deshon main ho jahaan ke log atyaachaar, anachar or shoshan ke shikaar ho
 Revolution can also happen in a rich and advanced country
 basharte uske nivasee yah mahasus kare ki unke saath anyaay ho rahaa he
 The people of France were realizing this injustice
 or se dur karnaa chaahati thi
 Many philosophers and writers were born there who drew the attention of people to these sufferings through their writings, in spite of the worsening situation of other European countries, there was first a revolution against Louis Solven in France
 is kranti ke anek kaaran the jo is prakaar he
 Changed form of French feudalism and improved status of farmers francisi kisaanon kii unnat avasthaa or samantvaad kaa badla hua swarup aisa kaaran tha
 This led to the first state revolution in France
 europea desh ke kisaan abhi udaasi kii sthiti main the
 But the French peasants had become independent
 unke paas apni jameen apana makaan itani suvidha ke baavjud samant kar evam samant sevaaon kaa ant nahin hua tha unhen apni aamadani kaa bahut bada hissaa samant kar ke rup main chukaana padataa tha
 And still his position is good
 ve paise bachaakar kuch na- kuch jameen kharid liya karte the jameen kharidne kii bhukh nirantar badhati ja rahi thi isamen samant kar va berogari baadhak the at: ve samant peshon ko hataane kii baat soch rahe the at: madhyam varg ke netritv main unhe bal mila or 1789 i
 main unhone vidroh kar diya
 Lack of tradition of liberal autocracy in France- anya europea deshon main bhi nirankush rajtantr tha
 But the emperors there had reduced their autocracy over time
 prasha kaa raja fredirak apane samay kaa mahaan prabud prashaasak tha
 Other countries of Europe followed by Russia, Italy, Spain etc
 unhone samaynusaar jaataa kii aarthik bhautik tathaa anya kshetron main unnat karne kaa yatha sambhav prayaas kiya
 But France lacked such liberal autocracy
 vahaan ke raja janata kii bhalaai ke liye kuch nahin kar rahe the
 Rather, it became his policy to collect more taxes and exploit the public
 isliye france kii janata isse ub gai thi isliye france kii janata nirankush rajtantr ko samaapt karnaa chaahati thi
 Awareness of medium france main hi sarvapratham kranti hone kaa kaaran vahaan kaa madhyamvarg tha
 Other countries also had a middle class but they were not as cultural, rich and educated as in France
 unamem shakti kaa abhaav tha
 They could not think of rebelling against the king
 france main madhyam varg ke log anek kaaran se apane samraaton se asantusht the
 And for his own defense, Raj was desperate to curb power
 anya europea rajyon main is tarah kii sthiti kaa abhaav tha
 There was no one to lead in other countries, there was a ready middle class in France
 at: sarvapratham france main hi kranti hui
 Usefulness of noble class kuleen vahg ko pahase visheshadhikaar is liye diya gaya tha ki ve shashan chalaane main raja kii madad kare
 And they also used to protect Janata
 parantu dhire – 2 yah kaary raja ke karmchaaree karne laga
 As a result, the usefulness of the nobility ended
 phir bhi iske visheshadhikaar main kisi prakaar kii katautee nahin kii gai
 Hence the peasants and middle class people started hating the Kulinwarg
 anya deshon main aisi baat nahin thi
 There still remained the father of the nobility
 darshanikon kaa prabhaav- In the 18th century, there was a chaotic movement throughout Europe
 darshanik, vichaarak, vaagyanik sabhi deshon main viddhman the
 But the main among them were the French thinkers
 jinhone kranti kaa manovaigyanik aadhaar prastut kiya
 He drew the attention of the people to the evils in the society and gave a voice to the people
 is tarah kaa prayaas anya deshon main nahin kiya ja rahaa tha
 France was the only field of thinkers like Montague, Voltaire Russo
 austria, prasha or rus main is tarah ke vichaarak nahin the
 In other countries of Europe, there was no class of philosophers who gave their real status and created satisfaction in them
 france main hi kranti hone kaa yah ek pramukh kaaran tha
 Lack of political participation england main jab madhyam varg ne jaagarukta ai to use desh kii raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa avasar diya gaya
 But this was not the case with France
 france kaa madhyam varg apane samraaton se kaaphi asantusht tha
 They were expected
 shikshit hone ke baavjood unhen kulinon kii tarah pratishtha uplabdh nahin thi
 They were not given the opportunity to participate in French politics
 isliye unhone asantusht hokar kranti kaa naaraa buland kiya

 Maharaja Ranjit Singh was the king of the Sikh Empire
 ve sher-e punjab ke naam se prasiddh hai
 Maharaja Ranjit was a man who not only kept Punjab united as a powerful province, but also did not allow the British to wander around his empire
 ranjit singh kaa janm san 1780 main gujranvala sandhawalia jat maharaja mahaan singh ke ghar hua tha
 In those days, Punjab was ruled by Sikhs and Afghans, who divided the whole area into many examples
 ranjit ke pita maha singh sukarchakia misal ke commander the
 Located in western Punjab, the area was headquartered in Gujranwala
 choti si umr main chechak kii vajah se maharaja ranjit singh kii ek aankh kii roshni jaati rahi
 It was only 12 years old when his father passed away and the entire burden of the Rajpat fell on his shoulders
 12 april 1801 ko ranjit ne maharaja kii oopaadhi grahan kii
 He was crowned by a descendant of Guru Nanak
 unhone lahore ko apni rajdhani banaaya or san 1802 main amritsar kii ore ruukh kiya
 Maharaja Ranjit fought many battles against the Afghans and drove them towards West Punjab
 ab peshawar samet pashtun kshetra par unheen kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 This was the first time Pashtuns were ruled by a non-muslim
 uske baad unhone peshawar, jammu kashmir or anandpur par bhi adhikaar kar liya
 He is also credited with forming the first modern Indian Army - the "sikh Khalsa Army"
 unki saraparasti main punjab ab bahut shaktishaalee suba tha
 This powerful army kept Britain from grabbing Punjab for a long time
 ek aisa mauka bhi aayaa jab punjab hi ekmaatr aisa suba tha, jis par angrejon kaa kabja nahin tha
 According to British historian JT Wheeler, if he had been a generation older, he would have conquered the whole of India
 maharaja ranjit khud anpadh the, lekin unhone apane rajya main shiksha or kala ko bahut protsaahan diya
 He established law and order in Punjab and never gave death penalty to anyone
 unka suba dharmanirpeksh tha unhone hinduon or sikhon se vasule jane vaale jajia par bhi roak lagaai
 Never forced anyone to adopt Sikhism
 unhone amritsar ke harimandir sahib gurudware main sangemarmar lagavaaya or sona madhvaaya, tabhi se use swarna mandir kaha jane laga
 The prized diamond Kohinoor was a treasure trove of Maharaja Ranjit Singh
 san 1839 main maharaja ranjit kaa nidhan ho gaya
 His mausoleum was built in Lahore, which still remains there
 unki maut ke saath hi angrejon kaa punjab par shikanja kasnaa shuru ho gaya
 After the british-sikh War, Punjab was made part of the British Empire on 30 March 1849 and the Kohinoor was introduced at Huzur in Queen Victoria
 ranjitsingh kaa janm san 1780 i
 main hua tha
 He was a proud king of the society, Ranjitsingh became the leader of Misl Sukrachakia at the age of twelve after the death of Mahan Singh
 san 1798 i
 main jamaan shah ke punjab se laut jane par unhone lahore par adhikaar kar liya
 Gradually, from the Sutlej to the Indus, he controlled all the Muslims who were ruling
 satluj or yamuna ke bich phulakiyon misl ke shaasha rajya kar rahe the
 In 1806 AD, Ranjitsingh also tried to subdue them, but was not successful
 ranjitsingh main sainik netritv ke bahut saare gun the
 He was a visionary
 ve saanwale rang kaa nate kad ke manushya the
 One of his eyes was lost due to Sheetla's wrath
 parantu yah hote hue bhi vah tejasvi the
 So as long as he was alive, all the missiles were buried
 us samay angrejon kaa rajya yamuna tak pahunch gaya tha or phulakiyaan misl ke raja angreji rajya ke prabhutv ko maanane lage the
 The British forbade Ranjitsingh from doing this
 ranjitsingh ne angrejon se ladanaa uchit na samajha or sandhi kar lee ki satluj ke aage ham apana rajya na badhayenge
 Ranjitsingh summoned the French troops, prepared his army in a military manner, in his military command
 ab unne punjab ke dakshini, pashchimi or uttari bhaagon par akraman karnaa prarambh kiya or das varsh main multan, peshawar or kashmir tak apane rajya ko badha liya
 Ranjitsinh had captured Peshawar in his possession, but he had to fight hard for many years to take full authority over that province
 vah puure punjab kaa swami ban chukaa; or use angrejon ke hastkshep kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa
 But at the time when the British asked for help from the Sikhs against the Napoleonic forces, they did not receive it
 ranjitsingh ne san 1808 i
 main apni mahatvakankshini saas sadakor ke naam peshawar kaa rajya parivartit kar diya tha
 Because it was a British agent woman
 ranjitsingh ne apni kuchakrapriy saas se jhagada karke use kaid kar liya tha or hvadani ke garh ko apane adhikaar main kar liya tha
 a contingent of the British army rescued the captive widow Sadakaur and recovered the authority
 british sena ke saath ranjitsingh kisi prakaar kaa jhagada nahin chaahate the
 The British could be accused of breaching the terms of the treaty
 isliye chupchaap maun rahakar usne taiyaariyaan prarambh kii thim phir bhi 1809 i
 main lard minto se sandhi kar lee
 However, this treaty caused the Maharaja to be greatly humiliated among the Sikhs
 uparyukt sandhi ke kaaran punjab ke afgani rajya tathaa afghanistan ko kuch had tak aantkit kar sake the
 In 1802, 1806 and 1810 AD, conquered Multan and took possession and made a treaty with Shah Shuja and kept it there and obtained a 'cohenoor diamond' for a glass of water from it
 1811 i
 main kabul ke shah mahmud ke akraman kii baat sunakar or yah jaankaar ki mahmud kaa iraadaa kashmir ke shaasha par akraman kaa he, usne kashmir par akraman kar diya taaki mahmud ko waapas janaa sambhav ho jaae or uski mitrataa bhi ise mil jaae
 After Kashmir it marched on Peshawar in 1822, Yarmuhammad Khan fought bravely leading the Afghans but was defeated in the end
 is yuddh main sikhon kaa bhi bada nuksaan hua
 Fearing Ranjitsingh's authority over Peshawar in 1838, Dost Mohammad Khan Kabulnaresh became very frightened and befriended Russia and Iran
 is baat ko dhyaan main rakhkar angrejon ne swayan ranjitsingh tathaa shahshuja ke saath ek trigutsandhi karai
 Maharaja Ranjitsingh was becoming unwell
 1838 main lakva kaa akraman hua, yadhyapi upachaar kiya gaya or angrej doctoron ne bhi ilaaj kiya, lekin 27 june 1839 i
 ko uskaa pranant ho gaya
 It was also generous
 kaashi vishwanath mandir par jo swarnpatr aaj dikhaai detaa he vah uski kaashiyatra tathaa udaartaa kaa parichaayak he
 He set aside a property worth Rs 47 lakh for charity
 jagannathamandir par bhi vah kohenur hira chadhaanaa chahta tha lekin us heere ko to videsh main jaakar chhin-bhinn hona tha
 After the Maharaja, the Sikh state disappeared due to the inability of the Sikhs to respond to mutual disharmony, treason and English diplomacy
 baat san 1812 kii he
 Punjab was ruled by Maharaja Ranjit Singh
 us samay maharaja ranjit singh ne kashmir ke soobedaar atamohammad ke shikanje se kashmir ko mukt karaane kaa abhiyaan shuru kiya tha
 Fearful of this campaign, Atma Mohammed left Kashmir
 kashmir abhiyaan ke peeche ek anya kaaran bhi tha
 Shahshuja, who was defeated by Mahmud Shah by Atamohammad, was imprisoned in the fort of Shergarh
 use kaidakhane se mukt karaane ke liye uski begum vafa begum ne lahore aakar maharaja ranjit singh se prarthana kii or kaha ki meharbaani kar aap mere pati ko atamohammad kii kaid se reeha karvaa den, is ahsaan ke badale beshkeemtee kohinoor hira aapako bhent kar duungi
 After Shahshuja was imprisoned, Wafa Begum was the ruler of Afghanistan in those days
 isi kohinoor ko hadapney ke laalach main bharat par akraman karne vaale ahamed shah abdali ke pautra jamaan shah ko swayan usee ke bhai mahmud shah ne kaidakhane main bhayankar yatnaaen dekar uski ankhen nikalava lee thim
 Zaman Shah was the son of Ahmad Shah Abdali's son Timur Shah, whose brother was Mahmud Shah
 astu, maharaja ranjaiti singh swayan chaahate the ki ve kashmir ko atamohammad se mukt karavaaen
 Therefore, upon coming to Suyog, Maharaja Ranjit Singh liberated Kashmir
 unke dewan mohakamchand ne shergarh ke kile ko gher kar vafa begum ke pati shahshuja ko reeha kar vafa begum ke paas lahore pahunchaa diya
 Rajkumar Kharagsingh accommodated them in Mubarak Haveli
 par vafa begum apane vaade ke anusaar kohinoor hira maharaja ranjit singh ko bhent karne main vilamb karti rahi
 Even several months passed
 jab maharaja ne shahshuja se kohinoor heere ke bare main poocha to vah or uski begum donon hi bahaane banane lage
 When more emphasis was given, he handed over a fake diamond to Maharaja Ranjit Singh, which proved to be a fake test of jewelers
 ranjit singh krodh se bhar uthe or mubarak haveli gher lee gai
 Food was not served there for two days
 varsh 1813 kii pehali june thi jab maharaja ranjit singh shahshuja ke paas aae or phir kohinoor ke vishay main poocha
 Shattered Shahshuja hid Kohinoor in his turban
 kisi tarah maharaja ko iskaa pataa chal gaya
 Hence, he pledged to put Shahshuja on the throne of Kabul by placing his hand on "gurugranth Sahib"
 phir use "pagadi-badal bhai" banane ke liye usase pagadi badal kar kohinoor praapt kar liya
 Wafa Begum, sitting in the curtain of the curtain, understood the prudence of the Maharaja
 ab kohinoor maharaja ranjit singh ke paas pahunch gaya tha or ve santusht the ki unhone kashmir ko aaazaad kara liya tha
 He wished to offer the Kohinoor diamond to the iconic Lord Jagannath in the temple of Jagannathpuri
 hindu mandiron ko manon sona bhent karne ke liye ve prasiddh the
 He also offered immense gold at the Vishwanath temple in Kashi
 parantu jagannatha bhagwaan tak pahunchane kii unki ichha koshadhyaksh beliram kii kuniti ke kaaran puri na ho saki
 After the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the British attacked the Sikhs in 1845
 ferozepur kshetra main sikh sena veertapurvak angrejon kaa muqabla kar rahi thi
 But the commander of the Sikh army, Lalsingh, betrayed and left the front and fled to Lahore
 is kaaran vijay ke nikat pahunchakar bhi sikh sena haar gai
 The British took the Kohinoor diamond from the Sikhs
 saath hi kashmir or hajaaraa bhi sikhon se chin liye kyonki angrejon ne dedh karod rupye kaa jurmaana sikhon par kiya tha, arthabhaav-grast sikh kisi tarah keval 50 lakh rupye hi de paae the
 Lord Harding brought the Kohinoor diamond to London to please Queen Victoria of England, which was handed over to Queen Victoria by the "east India Company"
 un dinon maharaja ranjit singh ke putr dilip singh vahiin the
 Some people say that it was from Dilip Singh that the British annexed the Kohinoor in London
 kohinoor ko 1 maah 8 din tak johariyon ne taraasha or phir use rani victoria ne apane taj main jadwa liya

 Evolution does not seek to explain the origin of life
 par kram-vikaas yah samajhaata he ki pracheen saral jivan se aaj kaa jatil jivan kaise viksit hua he
 Seeing the similarities between all the castes of today, it can be said that all the creatures of the earth have a common ancestor
 ise antim saarvjaanik purvaj kehete hai
 All the castes of today have arisen from this through the process of evolution
 sabhi shakson ke paas jeens ke rup main anuvaanshik padaarth hota he
 All the individuals take it from their parents and give it to their children
 santanon ke jeens main thodi bhinnata hoti he
 This is due to mutation and alteration of existing genes during sexual reproduction
 iske kaaran santane mata-pita or ek duusare se thodi bhinn hoti hai
 If those variations are useful, then the chances of survival and reproduction of the offspring are high
 iske kaaran agali peedi ke vibhinn shakhson ke jivit rahane or prajnan karne kii sambhaavna samaan nahin hoti he
 As a result, the traits that make organisms more adapted to their conditions, become more common in the next generations
 ye bhinnataayen dhire-dhire badhati rahati hai
 This process is responsible for the diversity of organisms seen today
 adhikansh genetic utparivartan shakson ko na koi sahaayta pradaan karte hai, na unki dikhaawat ko badalte hai or na hi unhen koi haani pahunchaate hai
 Through genetic drift, these unbiased genetic mutations are only incidentally established in populations and survive for generations
 iske vipareet, prakritik varan ek yadrichhik prakriya nahin he kyonki yah un lakshanon ko bachaati he jo jivit rahane or prajnan karne ke liye jaruri hai
 Natural selection and genetic drift are regular and dynamic parts of life
 arabon varshon main in prakriyaaon ne jivan ke vansh vriksh kii shakhaon kii rachana kii he
 The modern thinking of evolution began with the emergence of the book Charles Darwin's Biology, published in 1859
 iske saath grager mendal dwaara padpon par kiye gaye adhyayan ne anuvaanshiki ko samajhane main madad kii
 The discovery of fossils, advances in population genetics and the global network of scientific research have provided more detailed information on the mechanism of evolution
 vaigyanikon ko ab nayi jatiyon ke udgam kii zyada samaj he or unhone ab prajatikaran kii prakriya kaa avlokan prayogshaala or prakruti main kar liya he
 Evolution is the basic scientific principle that biologists use to understand life
 yah kai vishyon main prayog hota he jaise ayurvigyaan, maanas shaastra, jaev sangrakshan, maanavshaastra, forensik vigyaan, krishi or anya saamaajik-saanskrithik vishay
 The main ideas of evolution are summarized as follows: 19 veen shatabdi main prakritik itihaas ke sangrahalay kaafii lokapriy the
 During this time European explorations and naval expeditions carried the natural scientists and collectors of large museums together
 charles darwin ek graduate the jo prakritik itihaas vigyaan ke vishay main shikshit or prashikshit the
 Natural historians like him used to collect specimens for museums, catalog them, describe and study them
 darwin echemes beagal naamak jahaaj par prakritik vaigyanik kaa kaam kar rahe the
 He was assigned a five-year research trip around the world
 apni yatraaon ke dauraan unhone bahut se jeevon ke namoonay ekatrit kiye or unka nirikshan kiya
 He was particularly interested in the diverse fauna of the coasts of South America and the nearby Galápagos Islands
 darwin ko dur-dur ke sthanon se namoonay ekatrit karne or unka adhyayan karne se vyapak anubhav praapt hua
 From these studies he introduced the idea that every caste evolved from ancestors with similar traits
 1938 main unhone samajhaayaa ki yah ek prakritik prakriya se kaise ho saktaa he
 He named this natural process natural selection
 kisi aabaadi kaa aakaar uske parivesh main maujuud sansadhano kii maatra par nirbhar karata he
 For the population to remain stable for years, it is necessary to balance the population size and available resources
 parivesh jitani santanon ko aashray de saktaa he, us se adhik paidaa hoti hai
 Due to this, not all persons of any generation can survive
 isliye uttarjivan ke liye jaruri sansadhano ke liye hameshaa ek pratyogi sangharsh bana rahata he
 This made Darwin realize that survival does not depend on mere coincidence
 unhen ehsaas hua ki uttarjivan shakson kii bhinnataaon, yaa "lakshanon", par nirbhar karata he
