 Due to the increasing demand of honey and its products in the market, beekeeping is now established as a profitable and lucrative enterprise

 Scientifically methodical beekeeping began in the late eighteenth century
 iske purv jangalon se paaramparik dhang se hi shahad ekatra kiya jaataa tha
 In the whole world, the method was almost the same in which people smoked, beekeeping, broke the silent hives from its place and then squeezed it and extracted honey
 jangalon main hamaare desh main abhi bhi aise hi shahad nikaali jaati he
 The modern scientific method of beekeeping is due to the west

 Collecting honey from wild bee colonies is one of the most ancient human activities and is still practiced by tribal societies in parts of Africa, Asia, Australia and South America
 africa main, haniguid pakshiyon ne insaanon ke saath ek parsparik sambandh viksit kiya he, unhen shishuon main le janaa or daavat main bhaag lenaa he
 This suggests that honey harvesting by humans may be of great antiquity
 Some of the earliest evidence of collecting honey from wild colonies is from rock paintings around the Upper Paleolithic

 It was not until the 18th century that European natural philosophers began the scientific study of bee colonies and began to understand the complex and elusive world of bee biology
 in vaigyanik agraduton main se sabase pramukh the, samradam, rene antony fercolt de remumoor, charles bonut or frankos hubar
 The first to use a microscope and dissection to understand the internal biology of bees were Svemaram and Remumur
 regumur pehle se hi ek anguthi ke andar kii gatividhiyon ko behatar dhang se dekhne ke liye ek glass divaardaar avlokan chhatey kaa nirmaan karne vaala tha
 He saw eggs laying in open cells, but still did not know how a queen was fertilized; No one had ever seen the proximity of the queen and embezzlement, and according to many theories that queens were "self-reproduction", while others believed that vapor or "incineration" coming from the drone squeezed without direct physical contact
 Queens
 hubar avlokan or prayog ke dwaara sabit karne vaala pehla tha ki quins shaareerik rup se pitti ke challe ke baahar dronon dwaara shaareerik rup se inseminated, aamtaur par ek bahut dur duuri he
 Following Remumur's design, Huber created superior glass-walled observations and sectional hives that could be opened like a book's leaves
 isane vyaktigat mom combs kaa nirikshan karne kii anumati di he or hive gatividhi ke pratyaksh rup se behatar nirikshan kiya he
 Although he went blind before he was twenty, Hueber hired a secretary, François Bernense, to conduct careful experiments and maintain accurate notes for more than twenty years
 huber ne pushti kii ki ek hive main ek rani hoti he jo sabhi mahila kaaryakartaaon kii matra or colony main nar drone hoti he
 He was also the first to confirm that intercourse with drones takes place outside the rings, and these queens are high in the air at a very good distance from their hive, by several consecutive matings with male drones

 Huber is universally regarded as the "father of modern bee science" and his "novels Observations sur les Abéiles" has explored all the basic scientific truths for the biology and ecology of bees
 madhu ke shuruaati roopon ko ikattha karne ke liye puure colony kaa vinaash hua jab shahad kaata gaya tha
 The wild hive was broken randomly, using smoke to suppress the bees, tearing off the honeycomb and with eggs, larvae and honey - liquid honey from the destroyed brood nest through a strainer or basket Was stressful

 The impurities remaining in them are either difficult to remove, or are added deliberately to get any special properties in the metal
 is prakaar milaae janevaale tatwon ko 'mishradhatukari tatv' kehete hai
 Two methods of steel production were prevalent in ancient times
 bharat kaa prasiddh 'vuts' ispaat inhen vidhiyon se banaaya jaataa tha
 In carbidation method, the cast iron is heated to a high temperature for sufficient time by placing it in contact with coke
 jin paatro main yah kriya kii jaati he unhen parivartan paatr kehete hai or ye pathar kii silon ke bane hote hai
 These characters are made of carburetic furnaces
 paatr ke andar vaayu kaa pravesh na ho iske liye inhen acchhee tarah se agnisah padaarthon se band kar diya jaataa he anyathaa vaayu ke prabhaav se koyala jalakar raakh ban jayega or lohe kaa oxikaran hone lagegaa
 The eligibility should cover 1,000 ° c in 48 hours
 Is heated to is taap ko saat se lekar nau dinon tak sthir banaae rakhte hai
 As a result of this action, the carbon of coal gets entered into iron
 jab carbon paryaapt gaharaai tak pahunch jaataa he tab paatro ko ek saptaah kii avadhi tak dhire dhire sheethal kiya jaataa he
 In this way, the blisters appear on the surface of the rods
 isliye inhen 'fafoledaar ispaat' kehete hai
 This steel is heated and beaten to make it homogeneous
 carbadhishoshan ispaat kii pitayee karne ke baad bhi isamen newnaadhik asamta rahati he
 This steel is liquefied in clocks and its chemical composition is reduced
 is kriya ke dwaara carbadhishoshan ispaat main vidyaman dhaatumal ke kanon se bhi mukti mil jaati he
 For this purpose, mostly 50 lb
 of graphite watches are used
 in ghadiyon main carbadhishoshan ispaat ko rakhkar inhen coke bhatthiyon main garam kiya jaataa he
 The watch method does not have the sophistication of the metal, so the appropriate charge for this should be as pure as possible
 pehle isi vidhi ke dwaara ucch koti kaa aujaari ispaat taiyaar hota tha
 The real revolution in steelmaking came in the last days of the 1850s
 besamar vidhi pratham safal vidhi thi jisase badi maatra main ispaat utpaadan kiya ja saktaa tha
 After this came the open stove method
 aadhunik ispatnirmaan ko do bhaagon main baant sakate hai - praathmik tathaa dwitiyak ispatnirmaan 
 Primary steel manufacturing is called that in which most of the new iron released from Vatya furnace is used for steel-making
 dwitiyak ispatnirmaan use kehete hai jisamen ispaat nirmaan ke liye bhangaar yaa kabad ispaat kaa upyog ho
 The gases released during steel making can be used as a source of energy
 san 1856 main henry besimar ne ispaat utpaadan kii vidhiyon main krantikari parivartan kiya
 In this method, called 'bessemer Variant' in breakfast, air is flown through the blower in liquefied cast iron
 dravit lohe main vidyaman apdravyon kaa oxikaran vaayu ke oxigen dwaara hota he
 These actions are exothermic, so this method does not require external fuel
 lohe main vidyaman apdravya oxikrut hokar dhaatumal banaate hai or bachaa hua loha ispaat kaa rup dhaaran kar letaa he
 The outer part of the Bessemer converter is made of steel plate and lining of thermodynamic materials are given inside
 besimar vidhi ke antargat do paddatiyaan prachlit hai : amleey tathaa samaakshareey 
 The application of these methods depends on the properties of the cast iron
 yadi kachche lohe main phosphorus kii maatra adhik hoti he to samaakshareey vidhi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Acidic methods are used where phosphorus neutralization is not required
 besimar parivartitra ke andar die janevaale ooshmasah padaartho ke astr upyog main laai janevaali paddati par nirbhar karte hai
 In the acidic system, most silicic materials are used, whereas in the coaxial system only coaxial materials, such as dolomite, are used
 besimar parivartitra ke nital main hawa tontiyaan lagi hoti hai, jinke dwaara dravit lohe main ucch daav par vaayu dhaunkani se pravaahit kii jaati he
 The high pressure is necessary so that during the blasting period, the fluid does not flow through the iron spout into the air of the transformer
 amleey paddati main mukhya apdravya silicon, manganeez tathaa carbon hote hai
 Their oxidation takes about 12 minutes
 pehle silicon tathaa meganese kaa oxikaran hota he or ve dhaatumal banaate hai
 Then carbon is oxidized to form carbon monoxide gas, which ignites at the mouth of the changer and produces a huge flame
 is kriya ke baad parivartitra paatr ko namith karke taiyaar ispaat ko darvi main nikaal liya jaataa he
 Then steel is made of the desired chemical composition by adding carburetic and deoxidizing into it again as needed
 samaakshareey paddati main sabhi kriyaayein amleey paddati kii tarah hi hoti hai, parantu usamen phosphorus ke oxikaran ke liye 5-6 minute kaa atirikt samay lagata he
 Phosphorus is oxidized only after gradual oxidation of silicon, manganese, and carbon and combines with the existing lime in the vessel to form coaxial sludge
 is dhaatumal ko alag karne ke pashchaat hi dhaatu main pun: carburikarak tathaa vioxikaarak daale jate hai
 It is also called 'basic Oxygen Method'
 san 1851 main austria ke linj tathaa donavitz dhaatuvigyon ne besimar vidhi ke samparivartit rup kii khoj kii, jise unke naam par el

 vidhi kaha gaya
 In this, pure oxygen is flushed over the surface of liquefied iron in the transformer vessel
 is vidhi se apdravyon kaa sheeghra oxikaran hokar nitrogen rahit ispaat kii prapti hoti he
 Today, about 75 percent of the world's steel production is done through open-cut furnace method
 is kaary ke liye khuli bhatthi kaa upyog hota he
 Like the Bessemer method, it also has acidic and coaxial transformations
 in paddatiyon kaa upyog kachche maal ke rasinic sanghatan par nirbhar karata he
 It is necessary to remember here that in the steel production method of open cuticle furnace, the quality of steel depends on the texture of the clinker
 isliye is vidhi main dhaatumal kii taiyaari par hi vishesh dhyaan diya jaataa he
 If coaxial sludge is required to be prepared, the 'coaxial Khulli Chulli Bhatti method' is used and if acidic sewage is required the 'acidic method' is used
 khuli chullibhatthee 25 se 300 ton dharita tak hi hoti he
 Chulital is 15 feet wide, 40 feet long and 20 inches deep in large brethren
 chullital kaa nirmaan vibhinn ooshmasah padaarthon se hota he
 Acidic heat is used in acidic system and coaxial thermodynamic materials are used in coaxial method
 bhrashtra kii diwaar tath chat saadhaarant: silica iton kii bani hui hoti hai
 Nowadays magnesite bricks are also being used for roofing
