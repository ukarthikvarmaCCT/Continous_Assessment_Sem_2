 saadharantah kurmali sahitya ko do bhaagon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he:- kurmali lok sahitya or kurmali shisht sahitya
 Folk literature contains those literature, for which it is not possible to make any definite guess about the origin, the time period, or the writer
 yah sahitya un kurmi sabhyataa ke us viksit paramparaagat gyaan or sahitya kaa sankalan hota he jo kii peedi-dar-peedi sadiyon se lok-katha, lok-geet, aadi main abtak kurmali-bhashi logo ko viraasat main mili he
 The materials found in the Kurmali folk literature can be divided into five broad categories: - kurmali main lokgeeton kii sankhya bahul he
 Even today, this song is alive in the folk world
 geet atyant saras or marmasparshi he
 The tradition of Kurmali songs is very ancient
 koi bhi anushthan geet evam nrity ke bina sampann nahin hota
 Most of the songs are dance songs
 raag ke dwaara hi geeton ke parthaky or vaishishty ko samajha ja saktaa he
 Kurmali folklore explores every aspect of Kurmali life, diverse perspectives and multidimensional views
 kurmali lok-geeton kii pramukh visheshta yah he ki adhikansh geet prashnottar ke rup main hai
 Is completely free from the law of verses
 iske apane chand hai jo gey hai
 The stylistic element can be identified only by the lyrics
 kahin-kahin swatah alankaaro kaa prayog hua he

 Kuramali folklore is full of supernatural and impossible things

 Among the edited texts, Hindi Shabdasagar, Nagari Pracharini Patrika, Bhramargeet Sar, Sur, Tulsi Jayasi Granthwali are notable
 shukla ji ne praayah saahitiyik or manovaigyanik niabandh likhe hai
 3 parts of literary essays can be done - saiddhanthik aalochanatmak niabandh- 'kavita kya he'
 Essays such as 'sanskritism of Lok Mangal in poetry', 'generalization and individualism', etc
 come under theoretical criticism
 aalochana ke saath-saath anveshan or gaveshna karne kii pravriti bhi shukla ji main paryaapt maatra main he

 Psychological Essay- Psychological essays include essays written on emotions and psyche, such as compassion, reverence, devotion, shame, guilt, anger, greed, love

 He was a firm supporter of Lokadarsha

 The language of the prose-literature of Shukla ji is standing and it often has two forms - shukla ji kaa donon prakaar kii bhashaa par purna adhikaar tha
 He is extremely careful, refined, mature and grammatically innocent
 usamen ranchamaatr bhi shithilataa nahin
 The words are interwoven into the formula of sentences like pearls
 ek bhi shabd nirarthak nahin, prayek shabd kaa apana purna mahatv he
 Shukla ji's style is fully marked by her personality
 yahi kaaran he ki prayek vaakya pukaar kar kah detaa he ki vah unka he
 In general, Shukla ji's style is very mature and original

 Shukla ji is perhaps the first critic of Hindi who made a genuine effort to interview the deep and broad goals of secret poetry in the fabric of diverse life
 unhone 'bhav yaa ras' ko kavy kii aatma mana he
 But in his view, the ultimate goal of poetry is not the joy but the reputation of Lokmangal by the sophistication, diffusion and harmony of various expressions
 unki drushti se mahan kavy vah he jisase jivan kii kriyasheeltaa ujagar hui ho
 He has called this the locality of folklore in poetry
 shukla ji kii samast moulik vichaarna lokajeevan ke moort aadarshon se patibaddh he
 'our heart is directly attached to the transverse forms of nature', therefore, the first and necessary work of the poet is to do 'bimbagrahan' or 'chitranubhav'
 purna wimbgrahan ke liye varnya vastu kii 'paristhiti' kaa chithran bhi apekshit hota he
 In this way Shukla ji emphasizes the overall realization of life through poetry
 jivan main or kavy main kisi tarah kii ekangita unhen abhisht nahin
 Shukla Ji's installations are not as scriptural as the original
 unhone apni lokbhaavna or manovaigyanik drushti se kavyashastra kaa sanskaar kiya
 With this view, they fall into Acharya category
 kavy main lokmagal kii bhaavana shukla ji kii samiksha kii shakti bhi he or seemaa bhi
 His power lies in poignant research into the practical and broader meanings of poetic life

 They have the unique ability to identify poetic sensations, their transparent analysis and convey them to the reader through accurate language

 Shukla ji's psychotic essays are the result of Prajna
 inamen bhaavon kaa manovaigyanik rup spasht kiya gaya he tathaa maanav jivan main unki aavashyaktaa, mulya or mahatv kaa nirdhaaran hua he
 According to the sentiments, the behavior of man changes - in this view Shukla ji researched his social economy consciously
 unhone manovikaron ke nishedh kaa upadesh denevaalon par jabardast akraman kiya or manovegon ke parishkar par jor diya
 These essays help readers to understand themselves and others in practical terms and make them realize social responsibility and dignity

 By associating the emotions with the familiar situations of life, they are also authentic representations in terms of poetry

 shukla ji kii sukhtiyaan atyant arthgarbha hoti hai
 His critical prose has made a wide impact on Hindi prose
 shukla ji kaa 'hindi sahitya kaa itihaas' hindi kaa gauravagranth he
 The chronology based on literary trends, abstract representations of literary streams and a critical review of poets are its main features
 shukla ji kii kavitaaon main unke prakrutiprem or saavdhaan saamaajik bhaavon dwaara unka deshaanurag vyanjit he

 The kings of the 18th dynasty of Egypt first adopted this policy and first created the empire of Egypt, King Thutmose III of the 18th dynasty became quite famous because of his Digvijay
 par baad main 18 wein vansh ke raja akhenaten ke kaal main misr samrajya dagamagane laga or usne apane kai praant kho die, akhenaten ne pracheen misr ke paaramparik dharm ko tyaag kar aten naam ke ishwar kii puja karne laga or ise rashtriya dharm ghoshit kar diya tha jis kaaran misr main araajaktaa fail gai thi
 After Akhenaten, his son Tutankhamun and his successors tried hard to bring back the lost glory of Egypt, but they failed
 horemheb jo 18 wein vansh kaa aakhri raja tha uski koi santan nahin thi isiilie usne apane amaatya rameces pratham ko apana uttaradhikari banaaya or rameces pratham ne 19 wein vansh kii niv rakhi
 Ramesses i and his son Seti i also adopted the policy of imperialism like the 18th dynasty and tried to bring the lost glory of Egypt
 karnak mandir ke lekhon ke anusaar seti pratham ne kannan or syria par vijay pai thi
 The same Hittite empire spread from Iraq to Turks in the north of Egypt was also expanding the empire 
 syria tab 18 wein vansh ke adheen tha par wo hittite samrajya ke adheen chalaa gaya tha
 The Rameses attacked Kadesh, a city of Syria, to win the lost province of the Egyptian Empire
 rameces ke pita seti pratham ne apane kaal main kadesh par vijay pai thi, par seti pratham ke shashan kaal ke antim samay main kadesh dubaara hittite samrajya ke adheen ho gaya
 This was also the reason for the war
 rameces ne apane shashan kaal ke 5wein varsh main dakshin se kadeshpar hamalaa kiya
 At the same time, the Hittite king Muwatalli, together with his neighboring kingdom, formed a union against the Egyptian army
 muvatalli ne apni sena kadesh main jamaa kar lee or apane guptchar rameces ke paas bheje, un guptcharon ne rameces ko jhooth kaha kii ve kadeshse dur he
 In 1274 BCE, Ramesses with his army was larger than his capital p Ramesses towards Kadesh, his army was divided into four columns named Amun, Ra, Seth and Pitah, another small group named Narin which is not mentioned much
 misr vaasiyon ke alaava rameces kii sena main kaanan, syria, nubia aadi deshon ke log bhi the
 Ramesses built many chariots, so much that historians can only guess
 muvatalli kii sena ke bare main rameces likhvata he ki muvatalli apane 19 padosi rajyon kii sena bulawaai thi rameces ke viruddh
 Ramesses writes in his article that he was in a large, Ramesses amun troop on Kadesh with his army
 vah sabase pehle kadesh kii pahadiyon par pahocha, phir orontes nadi paar kar vah kadesh nagar pahocha
 Amun troop was behind Ramesses, Ra troop was in a nearby town, Patah troop was in a south town and Sethu troop was on the road
 jab rameces kadesh se 11 kilometre dur tha tab use kuch banjaare mili jo asal main muvatalli ke guptchar the, unhone rameces ko jhooth bataaya kii muvatalli firo se dar gaya he or hathi sena yahan aane se dar rahi he, hathi sena aleppo kii bhoomi main he jo yahan se 200 kilometre dur he
 But later when those Banjars were beaten, they confessed the truth and told that Muwatalli's army was nearby
 puri hathi sena ne ek saath misr kii sena par hamalaa bol diya
 The Ramesses had divided their forces into pieces and they were far from each other, the Hatti army first attacked the Ra's troops and almost destroyed it, the remaining warriors somehow reached the Amun troop
 rameces ne pitaah or set tukdi ko sandesh bheja par tab tak hathi sena amun tukdi tak pahoch chuki thi
 Hatti Ratho broke the security wall of the Amun troop and started killing them
 rameces apane lekh main likhvata he ki use hathi sena ne gher liya tha, uske paas koi angrakshak yaa koi yoddha na tha
 Then the Ramesses took the front and killed many of the Cesanics, then the remaining warriors of Amun and Ra's troops came to save their king
 hathi sena ke kai yoddha misr ke shiviron ko lutane ke liye chale gaye, or jo bache the unase rameces or bache hue misr ke yoddha lard rahe the
 With the help of a chariot and a bow, the Egyptian soldier greatly defeated the Hassan
 rameces ko acha avasar mila or usne bephikr hathi sena par hamalaa kar diya jo lutpaat kar rahi thi, rameces ne hathi sainik ko orontes nadi ke paar khaded diya
 Even after the Hatti army was repulsed, Muvattalli again sent a large army, in that army there were many chariots, foot soldiers who were inside the city wall
 hathi sena dubaara misr ke shivi tak pahochi par achaanak se naarin tukdi ne hamalaa bol diya, hathi sena chakit ho gai thi
 By then the Ramesses had gathered their entire army and attacked the Hatti army
 ab hathi sena ghir chuki thi or lagbhag tabah ho chuki thi, bache hue hathi sainik kadesh tak kisi tarah pahoch gaye
 The next day the war started again, Rameses writes that Muvattalli had called him for a ceasefire treaty, but there is no mention in the Hittite article
 misr sainik kadesh kii deevaaron ko giraane main naakaam rahe or muvatalli bhi misr sainiko ko khadedane main naakaam rahaa jabaki lag rahaa tha kii jeet uske paksh main he
 Both sides suffered a lot and eventually the war ended without any result

 PH or ph is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution
 ise draveebhoot hydrogen yanon kii gatividhi ke sah-laghuganak ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 The activity coefficients of hydrogen ions cannot be measured experimentally, so they are based on theoretical calculations
 ph scale, koi sunishchit scale nahin he; iskaa sambandh maanak vilyan ke ek set ke saath hota he jiske ph kaa akalan antarrashtriya sanvida ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The concept of ph was first introduced in 1909 by the Danish chemist Sören Peder Lauritz Sørensen of the Carlsberg Laboratory
 yah abhi bhi agyaat he ki p kii sateek paribhaasha kya he
 Some references suggest that p signifies "power" and others refer to it as the German word "potenz", and still others refer to it as "potential"
 jens norbi ne 2000 main ek patr prakashit kiya jisamen usne tark diya ki p, ek sthiraank he or "rinatmak laghuganak" kaa pratik he; jiskaa prayog anya kaaryon main bhi kiya jaataa he
 h is a symbol of hydrogen
 sorensen ne suvidha ke liye "PH" sanket kaa suzav diya jo "power of hydrogen" kaa pratik he jisamen solution, p main hydrogen aayan kii sandratha ke sah-laghuganak kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 Although this definition has been superseded
 yadi ek electrode ko gyaat hydrogen aayan kii sandratha ke solution ke saath anshakit kiya jaataa he to p ko mapa ja saktaa he
 Pure water is considered neutral
 25 °se
 par shuddh jal kaa ph, 7
0 ke aas-paas hota he
 Solutions with a ph less than 7 are called acidic and solutions with a ph greater than 7 are called alkaline or alkaline
 chikitsa shaastra, jeev vigyaan, rasayan shaastra, khaadya vigyaan, paryaavaran vigyaan, samudr vigyaan or kai anya anuprayogon main ph ke maapan kaa bahut mahatv he
 ph is defined as the decimal logarithm subtraction of the activity of hydrogen ion in an aqueous solution
 isaki laghuganakeey prakruti kii visheshta ke kaaran, ph, ek ayamarahit quantity he
 Where a h is the activity of hydrogen ions
 is paribhaasha kaa kaaran yah he ki a H, kisi ekal aayan kaa ek gun he jise keval ek aayan-chaynaatmak electrode kii sahaayta se prayogtmak rup se mapa ja saktaa he jo nernst sameekaran ke anusaar hydrogen aayan kii gatividhi ke saath pratikriya karata he
 The ph is usually measured with the help of a composite glass electrode that measures the potential difference or electromotive force, E, between an electrode sensitive to the activity of hydrogen ion and a reference electrode such as a calomel electrode or a silver chloride electrode
 is
 sanyukt glass electrode adarshatah nernst sameekaran kaa anusaran karata he: Where e is a measured potential and e 0 is the standard electrode potential ie the standard state electrode potential with activity also being one
 R, gas sthiraank he; T, kelvin taapmaana he; F, farade sthiraank he or n, hastantarit electrons kii sankhya kaa ek udhaaharan he
 The electrode potential, E, is proportional to the logarithm of the activity of the hydrogen ion
 yah paribhaasha apane aap main puri tarah se avyaavhaarik he kyonki hydrogen aayan kii gatividhi, sandratha or gatividhi gunank kaa gunanfal hota he
 The coefficient of activity of a single-ion of a hydrogen ion is a quantity that cannot be measured experimentally
 is kathinaayee se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye, electrode ko gyaat gatividhi ke solution ke sambandh main anshakit kar diya jaataa he
 The operational definition of ph is officially defined by the International Standard ISO 31-8 as follows: For solution X, the galvanic cell's electromotive force, EX is measured | kcl kaa sandrit solution || solution x | H2 | Pt or tab ek galvanik cell ke electromotive bal, e s ko bhi mapa jaataa he jo gyaat maanak ph ke solution s ke dwaara agyaat ph ke solution X, ph kii pratisthapana dwaara uparyukt se bhinn hota he
 Then x has a ph of solution x ke ph or maanak solution ke ph ke bich kaa antar keval do maape gaye potential ke bich ke antar par nirbhar karata he
 Thus, ph is obtained from a potential measured with an electrode calibrated against one or more ph standards; a ph meter setting is adjusted such that the reading of the meter of the standard solution is equal to the ph value
 maanak solution s ke ek range ke ph maanon ko, aage kii vistrut jaankaree ke saath, IUPAC kii anushansa main darshaya gaya he
 Standard solutions are often described as standard buffer solutions
 vyavhaar main, vaastavik electrode main nernst ke niyam kii adarshata se chote-chote vichlan ke liye anumati dene ke liye do yaa do se adhik maanak bafer kaa prayog karnaa behatar hota he
 Note that since temperature is found in the defining equations, the ph of the solution is temperature-based
 bahut kam ph maanon, jaise kuch bahut amleey khadaan ke jalon ke maapan ke liye vishesh prakriyaaon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In such cases the calibration of the electrode can be done with a concentrated sulfuric acid standard solution whose ph values can be calculated using Pitzer parameters to calculate activity coefficients
 ph, ek amlata ke function kaa udhaaharan he
 The concentration of hydrogen ion can be measured in aqueous solvents, but this results in a different acidity function because the standard state of aqueous solvent is different from the standard state of water
 superacids, ajaleey amlon kaa ek varg he jiske liye hamet amlata ke function, h 0 ko viksit kiya gaya he
 This was Sorensen's original definition superseded in favor of ph
 haalanki, hydrogen yanon kii sandratha ko pratyaksh rup se maapna sambhav he, yadi hydrogen ke aayan kii sandratha ke sandarbh main electrode ko anshakit kiya jaataa he
 One way to do this, which has been used on a large scale, is to measure the solution of known concentrations of a strong acid with a solution of known concentrations of strong alkali in the presence of a relatively high concentration of background electrolyte
 chunki acid or kshar kii sandratha gyaat hoti he isliye hydrogen yanon kii sandratha kii gananaa karnaa aasaan hota he taaki maape gaye potential ko sandratha ke saath sah-sambhddha kiya ja sake
 anshaakan kaa kaary praayah gran plot kaa prayog karke kiya jaataa he
 The calibration generates a slope factor, f and a value for the standard electrode potential, e 0, to form the Nernst equation
 main e ke praayogic maapan se hydrogen aayan sandratha ko praapt karne ke liye prayukt ho saktaa he
 The slope factor is usually slightly less than one
 0
95 se kam kaa ek slop factor yah darshata he ki electrode sahi dhang se kaam nahin kar rahaa he
 The presence of background electrolyte ensures that the hydrogen ion activity coefficient is effectively constant during titration
 chunki yah sthir hota he isliye iske maan ko maanak sthiti ko paribhaashit karke ek main sthapit kiya ja saktaa he jo becoground electrolite yukt solution hota he
 Thus, the activity resulting from the use of this process is equated to the numerical value of the concentrations
 p or ph ke bich kaa antar bahut kam hota he
 It has been said that ph = p + 0
04
 Unfortunately, it is very common to use the noun "ph" for both types of measurements
 poh ko kabhi-kabhi kshariyata yaa hydroxide yanon, OH− kii sandratha ke ek maap ke rup main prayukt hota he
 poh cannot be measured independently but is derived from ph
 jal main hydroxide yanon kii sandratha, Is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions where KW is the constant of self-ionization of water
 nimna sah-laghuganak ko liya jaataa he So, at room temperature poh ≈ 14 - ph
 However, in other circumstances such as measurement of soil alkalinity, this relationship is not fully valid
 shuddh jal lagbhag 7 ph hota he; sateek maan, taapmaana par nirbhar karata he
 When an acid is dissolved in water, the ph will be less than 7 and when an alkali or an alkali solution is made in water, the ph will be greater than 7
 The ph of a solution of a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid, at 1 mol dm − 3 concentration is 0
 1 mol dm−3 sandratha par sodium hydroxide jaise kisi strong kshar ke solution kaa ph, 14 hota he
 Thus, the measured ph values will mostly be within 0 to 14
 Since ph is a logarithmic scale, a ph unit difference is equal to a tenfold difference in hydrogen ion concentration
 chunki glass electrode, gatividhi kii pratikriya karata he isliye electrode ko kisi aise madhyam main anshakit kiya janaa chahie jo kisi jaanch kiye ja rahe madhyam ke samaan hota he
 For example, if one wants to measure the ph of a sample of seawater, the electrode must be calibrated in a solution that has a chemical composition similar to that of seawater, which is detailed below
 ek ph indicater kaa prayog karke ph ke ek lagbhag maap ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 a ph indicator is a substrate that changes the color surrounding a particular ph value
 yah ek wyk acid yaa wyk base he or rang parivartan yaa to 1 ph ikai ke aas-paas amla pruthakkaran sthiraank main yaa pk a maan main, donon main se kisi ek taraf hota he
 For example, naturally occurring litmus turns red in acidic solution and blue in alkaline solution

 Shown below is the temperature of stars in different categories and the size and luminosity of our sun
 dhyaan rahe ke yah sirf mukhya anukram ke taron ke liye jaays he - In the period after 1880 AD, scientists working at the observatory of Harvard University made the categories of stars from 'A' to 'O'
 lekin 1920 ke dashak main bhartiya khagolvaigyanik meghnad saaha ne taron ke varnakram or unke satahi taapmaana main sambandh dikhaaya
 As the knowledge in this field grew, scientists changed the categories according to temperature and where the two categories were actually about stars of the same temperature, they were merged to remove one category
 saaha ke or anya vaigyanikon ke adhyayan se yah baat saafe ho gai ke OBAFGKM darasal satahi taapmaana kii shreniyan hai
 In 1943, three scientists working at the Yorkies Observatory created a new grading method for the spectrum of stars

 Where Harvard grading runs only according to surface temperature and is used only for dwarf stars, both surface temperature and luminosity are used in the Yerkys grading and all the stars are graded

 Akali Dal akali dal kaa gathan disambar 1920 ko 14 shiromani gurudwara prabandhak cameti, sikh dharmik sharir ke ek kaary bal ke rup main kiya gaya tha
 The Akali Dal considers itself the principal representative of the Sikhs
 sardaar sarmukh singh chubbal ekikrut akali dal ke pehle adhyaksh the, lekin isane master tara singh ke netritv main adhik lokapriyata praapt kii
 Master Tara Singh was a staunch Sikh leader
 unhone angrej sarkaar kii sahaayta se sikhpanth ko brihat hindu samaaj se pruthak karne ke sardaar ujjvalasinh majithia ke prayaas main har sambhav yoga diya
 The party started the Punjabi Suba movement, led by Sant Fateh Singh, demanding a state with a majority of Punjabis from undivided eastern Punjab
 sarkaar ko prasann karne ke liye sena main adhikadhik sikhon ko bhartee hone ke liye prerit kiya
 Due to them, Sikhs were also given separate communal representation like Muslims in India Act 1919
 mahayuddh ke baad master ji ne sikh raajnneeti ko congress ke saath sambhddha kiya or sikh gurudwaron or dharmik sthalon kaa prabandh hindu mathadhishon or hindu pujaariyon ke haath se chhinakar unpar adhikaar kar liya
 This led to an unprecedented increase in the strength of the Akali Dal
 master tarasingh shiromani gurudwara prabandh cameti ke pratham mahaamantri chune gaye
 The placement of the glands came into his hands
 inaki sahaayta se akaliyon kaa antkapurna prabhaav sampurna punjab main chaa gaya
 Master Tara Singh later was elected President of the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee several times
 master tarasingh ne san 1921 ke savinay avagya andolan main sakriy rup se bhaag liya, par san 1928 kii bhartiya sudhaaron sambandhi neh degree cameti kii report kaa is aadhaar par virodh kiya ki usamen punjab vidhansabha main sikhon ko 30 pratishat pratinidhitiv nahin diya gaya tha
 Then the Akali Dal severed its ties with the Congress
 1930 main purna swarajya kaa sangram prarambh hone par master tarasingh tatasth rahe or inke dal ne dwitiya mahayuddh main angrejon kii sahaayta kii
 The "pathik" party organized by Master Tara Singh in 1946's General Assembly won 20 out of the 33 seats assigned to the Sikhs in the assembly of the united Punjab
 master ji ne sikhistan kii sthapana ke apane lakshya kii purti ke liye jinna se samjhauta kiya
 Assisted him in forming the League's cabinet in Punjab and finding the basis for the creation of Pakistan
 lekin raajnneeti ke chatur khilaadi jinna se bhi unhen niraashaa hi haath lagi
 After the announcement of partition of India, riots started in Amritsar under Master Tara Singh's plan to take advantage of the opportunity, but this attempt of Master Ji also failed
 master ji ne samvidhanparishad main sikhon ke sampradayik pratinidhitiv ko kaayam rakhane, bhashasuchi main gurumukhi lipi main punjab ko sthaan dene tathaa sikhon ko harijanon kii bhanti vishesh suvidhaayen dene par bal diya or sardaar patel se aashwaasan praapt karne main safal hue
 Thus the Constitutional Council also sealed the separate existence of Sikh sect and by providing special facilities to the Sikhs, opened the way for quick spread of Sikh sect by conversion of poor and Dalit Hindus
 tarasingh ise sikh rajya kii sthapana kaa aadhaar maanate the
 At the time of the election agreement with the Congress in the 1952 General Election, he was successful in making the decision of the creation of a separate Punjabi speaking state and the establishment of a Punjabi University by the Congress Working Committee
 master tarasingh ne vibhinn andolanon ke silsile main anek baar jailyatraayen kii, par dilli main yojit ek vishaal pradarshan kaa netritv karne se purv mukhyamantri sardaar pratapsingh kairon dwaara bandi banaaya janaa unke netritv ke hraas kaa kaaran bana
 In those days, the movement of independent Punjab under the leadership of Master Tara Singh was going on in full swing
