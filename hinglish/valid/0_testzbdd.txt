 Generally we do not feel it
 yadi hamaare sharir ke kisi ang se vaayu nikaal lee jaae, tab vaayu ke dabaav kii anubhuti hamen saralata se ho jaati he
 The amount of air pressure at sea level is equal to 760 mm of mercury pressure
 jaise jaise ham vaayu main upar uthte hai, taise taise dabaav kam hota jaataa he
 Even the pressure on some mountain tops has been found to be up to 9 pounds per square inch
 vaayu ko dabaaya bhi ja saktaa he
 Pressing increases its pressure
 aisi dabi hui vaayu kaa sampidit vaayu kehete hai
 This action of pressing is called 'compressing'
 sampeden se vaayu kaa aaytan kam ho jaataa he or dabaav bad jaataa he
 Thus air pressure can be raised very high
 sampidit vaayu kaa upyog aaj bahut adhik kaamon main ho rahaa he
 It is said to be happening in over two hundred works
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki do sau se adhik kaamon main ho rahaa he
 And it is increasing day by day
 iske upyog me koi khatra nahin he
 It can be easily transported to every location by machines
 isaki kuch mashine badi saral hai or kuch jatil bhi hai
 Compressed air can be used in two ways: by compressed air in machines, such air can be placed directly in the works, or compressed air can be stored in cylinders and stored in different works as required
 is
 sampidit vaayu praapt karne kii mashiinon ko vaayu sampidak kehete hai
 The simplest device for compressing the air is the air pump to fill the air in the bicycle or motorcar tubes
 par vaayu pump se adhik dabaav vaali sampidit vaayu nahin praapt ho sakati
 Complex air compressors are built for high pressure
 pehle pahal inkaa upyog sampidit vaayu dwaara chaalit drillon se pahaado ko katkar surang banane main hua tha
 They were also used in the rear rail brakes
 saamaanya vayusampidak se prati varg inch 60 se 100 pound kii dabaavvaali vaayu praapt hoti he
 Compressors are also made from which thousands of pounds of pressurized air can be obtained
 sampidak main silinder ke andar ek piston hota he
 There are two valves at one end of the cylinder, one opening inward and the other facing outward
 silinder ke piston ko jab khinchakar upar ke chor par laayaa jaataa he, tab silinder ke andar kii vaayu kaa dabaav kam ho jaataa he or vayumandal se vaayu is valve dwaara khinch lee jaati he
 When the piston is lowered, the opening valve closes as the pressure increases, and the outside valve opens, allowing the air of the cylinder to drain into the "wind"
 is prakriya ko kai baar dohraane se vayukaksh kii vaayu kaa dabaav dhire dhire badhane lagata he
 Air of appropriate pressure can be used by removing the tap
 vaayu sampidkon ko teen shreniyon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he : The diaphragmatic compressors are more commonly used
 inkaa siddhant vaisaa hi he jaisaa upar varnit he
 The air is pumped into the tubes of bicycles and motor vehicles by air pumps
 vaayu sampidkon se praapt sampidit vaayu dwaara chaalit drillon se pahaado main chhed kar surang banaai ja sakati he
 By air compressors, ventilation is done in theaters, cinemas, large buildings and mines, from which unclean air is removed and replaced by pure air
 isi sahaayta se pisai bhi ho sakati he
 Coal, stone, sand, concrete, etc
 are broken and crushed by large hammers from compressed air
 vaayu sampidak se praapt sampidit vaayu se revet kiya ja saktaa he or loha tathaa ispaat chhile ja sakate hai
 With the help of compressed air, polish can be carried on large ships, aircraft, motorcars, etc
 and varnish can be mounted
 gharon kii safai, deevaaron kii safedi tathaa rangaai ore fernichar par varnish chadhaai, vayusampidkon se praapt sampidit vaayu kii sahaayta se kam kharch main ho jaati he
 The cleaning of many items and the sowing of houses are also done with its help
 rail ke brake sampidit vaayu ke bal se kaary karte hai
 With the help of compressed air, many goods, such as grains, coal, etc
, can be sent from one place to another
 sampidit vaayu kii upyogita kii suchi kaaphi lambii he
 The use of compressed air is an important feature of modern science
 mahatma gandhi kaashi viapeeth bharat ke uttar pradesh rajya ke varanasi main sthit ek vishvavidhyalay he
 Earlier it was known only as Kashi Vidyapeeth but later it was rededicated to the great leader of India, Mahatma Gandhi and his name was added to it

 Its inauguration, like its contemporaries Gujarat Vidyapeeth and Jamia Islamia, was also completely beyond the control and support of the British authorities
 bhartiya shikshavid or rashtrapremi log hi iskaa sara prabandhan or dekharekh karte the
 Gandhiji and other Indian nationalists used to motivate the people of India to devise education institutions run by the British at that time and wanted people to give priority to the institutions run by Indians
 pramukh rashtravaadi va vidwaan acharya narendra dev, da rajendra prasad, jeevat ram kriplani, babu shri prakaash, babu sampoornanand aadi mahaan log isamen shikshan kaary kiye
 Former Prime Minister of India late Lal Bahadur Shastri also studied at this school

 unhen 'dwitiya kabir' bhi kaha jaataa he
 The exact date of birth and death of Saint Palatu is not known
 ayodhya se praaia: chaar mile par avasthit ramkot main inaki ek samadhi he jahaan par inaki mrityutithi asina shukla 12 batalaai jaati he
 But no Samvat is given and likewise in the book 'brahmavilas' of his disciple Hulasadas, his birth is Magha Sudi 7 Sunday, no
 1826 is said to have been told, but it seems that this will be his time to receive initiation from them
 sant palatu sahab jati ke kandu baniyaa the or yah nagajalalpur, main jo azamgarh jile kii pashchimi seemaa ke nikat vartmaan he, utpann hue the, kintu inke mata-pita ke naamon kaa kahin ullekh nahin miltaa he
 It is said that he too was a disciple of Jankidas like Purohit Govind Dubey of his village, but then he was initiated by Saint Bhikha Saheb but he took initiation from him
 inkaa pehle koi or naam tha, kintu inke guru govind sahab ne, inamen 'pal pal par ajapa jaap main lag jane kii drudh pravriti' paakar inhen palatu kahana aarambh kar diya
 They continued to live for a simple householder for a long time and after turning their heads back and breaking the girdle, they got into the disinterested monks
 inkaa kahana he ki madhumakhiyon ke, buund buund karke ekatra kiye gaye madhu ke kisi anya dwaara nikaal liye jane par dukhi ban jaati dekhakar mujhe maaya ke rahasy kaa bodh ho gaya or maine use bhalaa samajhakar uskaa parityag kar diya 
 But it says so much that due to this my reputation has increased due to which serious people started offering gifts at my feet and those who were inside the curtain started reaching me
 falat: paditon, kaajiyon tathaa vairaagi logon ne milakar mujhe 'ajaat' ghoshit kar diya or sabhi mere peeche pad gaye

 Their lines use very clear and simple but eloquent and idiomatic language, and depending on the truth of their heart and the bold expression of their expressions, they are sometimes referred to as even the second 'kabir'
 in donon main vichaarsamya ke saath-saath ek hi jaise shabdon evam vaakyon kaa vyavhaar kiya gaya tak lakshith hota he
 The saint 'palatu-cult' also started

 hindko shabd kaise bana iske bare main kai vichaar prachlit hai
 The initial people coming to India from Asia and Iran established contact with this dialect after crossing the Hindukush mountain
 kyunki hindukush ko paar karne ke baad hindustan ke raste main koi khaas rukaawat nahin thi isi liye is boli ko hindustan kii boli yaa hindko kaha gaya
 The Greek people have used the word Indicos for Hindustan and that is why the dialect here is called Hindco

 iske baad bane vansh ko saasaani kehete hai kyonki unka purvavarti saasaan tha
 Devagupta in ancient India was ruled by Magadha from 3rd century to 5th century
 is vansh ke parvarti gupt nareshon ne bhi uttari bharat main shashan kiya
 Although the word 'gupta' is attached at the end of the names of 'devagupta' and these other kings, it is difficult to prove that the subsequent Gupta kings were descendants of eminent Gupta emperors
 devgupt kaa naam 'harshcharit' tathaa abhilekhon main aata he jis aadhaar par ise parvarti gupt raja maanate hai
 The genealogy of the later kings is mentioned in an article from Afsad near Gaya Nagar in Bihar
 is vansh ke chathe raja mahasen gupt kaa jyeshtha putr devgupt hi tha
 It is said in Harshacharit that Mahasena Gupta installed Guptakul on eastern Malwa, after that Devgupta became the ruler of there
 chhathi shatee ke chaar pramukh rajkulon main pushpabhuti tathaa parvarti gupt vanshon main maitri thi tathaa devgupt or goud naresh kannauj ke moukharivansh se irsha rakhte the
 Dev Gupta met Shashank and killed Maukhari King Graha Varma
 harshcharit main grahaverma kaa ghaatak malvaraj kaha gaya he jise kalantar main rajyavardhan ne parrast kiya
 According to the Vardhan Tamrapattas, Rajyavardhan defeated Devgupta and hence the King of Malav remains Devgupta
 isse bhinn devvarna abhilekh main varnit devgupt adityasena kaa putr kaha gaya he
 He was defeated by the Chalukya king Vinayaditya in 680 AD
 use 'sakalottarapathanath' bhi kaha gaya he, par is devgupt kii samta prasiddh maalav naresh devgupt se nahin kii ja sakati
 Both were two different people
 bhashaa kii vartanee kaa arth us bhashaa main shabdon ko varnon se abhivyakt karne kii kriya ko kehete hai
 Its need in Hindi was not understood for a long time; While it was important in many other languages, such as English and Urdu
 angreji va urdu main ardhshatabdi pehle bhi vartanee kii ratai kii jaati thi jo aaj bhi abhyaas main he
 Phonetics is the first and great feature of Hindi language
 hindi main uccharit dhvaniyon ko vyakt karnaa bada saral he
 Write as you say
 yah devanagari lipi kii bahumukhi visheshta ke kaaran hi sambhav tha or aaj bhi he
 But this point is not 100 percent right now
 iske anek kaaran he - kshetreey aanchalik uccharan kaa prabhaav, anekarupata, bhram, parampara kaa nirvaah aadi
 When it was felt that many spellings of the same word were found, then there was a search for a meaningful word to express them
 is kaaran se maanakeekaran kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kii jane lagi
 The absence of its use in the authentic Hindi dictionary published in 1950, along with the early versions of the Hindi Shabdasagar and the abridged Hindi Shabdasagar, indicate that no need for the word was understood until the middle of this century
 chathe dashak main vartanee shabd ko sthaan mila, jiskaa sandarbh tab prakashit hui do pustakon main miltaa he: Pro
 According to Srivastava, the Hindi spelling problem is not as severe as that of English, because it is purely phonetic; Because even today the written word in Hindi is not much different from its accented form
 inhone akshari shabd kaa prayog kiya, jo prachlan main nahin aa sakaa; kyonki usee samay lekhak ne cilibill ke liye akshar kaa prayog apane doctoret ke granth hindi bhashaa main ‘akshar’ tathaa shabd kii seemaa’ main sthir kar diya
 By that time, the 'description' in Bihar was the word 'banana' in Bengal for spelling spelling
 iske alaava prachlan main kuch anya shabd the -aksharnyas, akshar vinyas, varnanyas, varna vinyas, aadi
 Education professor Krishna Gopal Rastogi used the word syllable for a long time
 yahi varna vinyas he
 In Amarkosh, the syllable for script and the use of writing is also found as a synonym
 uparyukt sabhi shabdon ke hote hue bhi ab is arth main ‘vartanee’ hi maanya ho gaya or bharat sarkaar ke kendriya hindi nideshaalay, nai dilli ne na keval is shabd ko manyata di, varan ekarupata kii drushti se kuch niyam bhi sthir kiye hai
 The spelling word is also from the Sanskrit language, Acharya Nishantketu, giving etymology, has given the lexicographical meanings of the word 'spelling': - the path, path, live, life and other meanings: grinding, powder making, pillow
 gyanmandal, varanasi dwaara prakashit ‘brihad hindi kosh’ main pehali baar vartanee kaa arth hijje diya gaya
 After much deliberation, the very broad definition of spelling was fixed: bhashaa-samrajya ke antargat bhi shabdon kii seemaa main aksharon kii jo aachaar sahita athwa unka anushaasangat samvidhan he, use hi ham vartanee kii sangya de sakate hai
 xxrep 4 
 Spelling is the current of the language
 vartanee bhashaa kaa anushaasit aavartan he, vartanee shabdon kaa sanskarita pad vinyas he
 The spelling is the bridge between the past and the future
 yah akshar santhaan or varna kram vinyas he
 Acharya Raghunath Prasad Chaturvedi expressed this by establishing its relation to Sanskrit grammar discourse
 vaarthik evam vartanee donon shabdon ke dhvanisamya evam arthsamya main samanta he
 There is a scientific analysis of the word cultivation through the sutra and in the discourse the flawed statement is fully considered by the sutras
 vartanee bhi isi samanaantar prakriya se guzarati he
 The collective purely form of spelling is also acceptable for the prosperity of the language
 vartanee shabd ke virdohi hote hue bhi acharya vaajapeyi is shabd ke utthan hetu inkaa yogadan tathaa hindi kii vartanee tathaa shabd vishleshan ullekhneey hai
 The standard Hindi spelling works in the Central Hindi Directorate
 is disha main kai diggajon ne apana yogadan diya, jinamein se acharya kishoridas vaajapeyi tathaa acharya ramchandra verma ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Due to the substantial increase in the number of Hindi learners within and outside the country as a result of the acceptance of the official language of the Union of Hindi language and some states, it seemed necessary and time-bound to set the standard system of Hindi spelling, so that more uniformity in the spelling of Hindi words Can be brought tadnusaar, shiksha mantralay, bharat sarkaar ne 1961 main hindi vartanee kii maanak paddati nirdhaarit karne ke liye ek visheshgy samiti niyukt kii
 This committee gave the final report in April 1962
 samiti kii chaar baithken huin jinamein gambhir vichaar-vimarsh ke baad vartanee ke sambandh main ek niyamavali nirdhaarit kii gai
 The committee accordingly submitted its final recommendations in 1962 which were approved by the government and eventually ushered in the official process of standardization of Hindi language
 yah prakriya to satat he, kintu mukhya nirdesh tay ho chuke hai
 These have been broadcast from the Central Hindi Institute and in all government offices in India

 Premchand is one of the greatest Indian writers in Hindi and Urdu
 mul naam dhanpat raay shrivastav, premchand ko nawab raay or munshi premchand ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Seeing his contribution in the field of novels, the famous novelist of Bengal, Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay, addressed him as novel Samrat
 premchand ne hindi kahani or upanyaas kii ek aisi parampara kaa vikaas kiya jisane puri sadi ke sahitya kaa maargdarshan kiya
 Premchand laid the foundation of the realistic tradition of literature by deeply influencing an entire generation
 unka lekhan hindi sahitya kii ek aisi viraasat he jiske bina hindi ke vikaas kaa adhyayan adhuraa hoga
 He was a sensitive writer, vigilant citizen, skilled speaker and sudhi editor
 beesvin shatee ke purvarddh main, jab hindi main takneekee suvidhaon kaa abhaav tha, unka yogadan athulaneey he
 After Premchand, the people who worked to advance literature with social concerns and progressive values include from Yashpal to Muktibodh

 They had three children - Sripat Rai, Amrit Rai and Kamala Devi Srivastava
 1910 main unki rachana soje-vatan ke liye hamirpur ke jila colector ne talab kiya or un par janata ko bhadakaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 All copies of Soje-watan were confiscated and destroyed
 colector ne nawabrai ko hidaayat di ki ab ve kuch bhi nahin likhenge, yadi likhaa to jail bhej diya jayega
 By this time Premchand used to write under the name Dhanpat Rai
 urdu main prakashit hone vaali zamana patrika ke sampadak or unke ajij dost munshi dayanarayan nigam ne unhen premchand naam se likhane kii salaah di

 "much of the discussion of Indian literature that emerged from prominence later, whether it is Dalit literature or women's literature, has its roots somewhere deep in Premchand's literature
 " premchand ke lekh 'pehali rachana' ke anusaar unki pehali rachana apane mamaa par likhaa vyangy thi, jo ab anuplabdh he
 His first available writing is his Urdu novel Asrar Maabid
 premchand kaa doosraa upanyaas 'hamakhurma va hamsawab' jiskaa hindi roopantaran 'prema' naam se 1907 main prakashit hua
 This was followed by Premchand's first story collection called soze-watan which was published in 1908
 soje-vatan yani desh kaa dard
 Fueled by patriotism, it was banned by the English government and warned its author not to do such writing in future
 iske kaaran unhen naam badalakar likhnaa padaa
 His first story titled 'premchand' was published in the December 1910 issue of Bada Ghar Ki Beti Zamana magazine
 maranoparant unki kahaniyaan maansarovar naam se 8 khandon main prakashit hui
 The story said that Emperor Premchand said that the litterateur is not the truth behind patriotism and politics, but rather the truth which shows the torch before him
 yah baat unke sahitya main ujagar hui he
 In 1921, he quit his job at the call of Mahatma Gandhi
 kuch maheene maryaada patrika kaa sampadan bhaar sambhala, chah saal tak maadhuri naamak patrika kaa sampadan kiya, 1930 main banaras se apana masik patr hans shuru kiya or 1932 ke aarambh main jaagran naamak ek saptahik or nikaala
 He presided over the conference of the All India Progressive Writers Association in 1936 in Lucknow

 Wrote the story of a film titled Mazdoor, released in 1934, and without completing the year-long period of contract, escaped to Benares, leaving two months' salary because he did not like the air and water of the film world in Bombay and more
 unhone mul rup se hindi main 1915 se kahaniyaan likhnaa or 1918 se upanyaas likhnaa shuru kiya
 Premchand wrote a total of nearly three hundred stories, about a dozen novels and many articles
 unhone kuch naatak bhi likhe or kuch anuwaad kaary bhi kiya
 Many literary works of Premchand were translated into many languages including English, Russian, German
 godaan unki kaaljayi rachana he
 Kafan is believed to be his final story
 unhone hindi or urdu main puure adhikaar se likhaa
 Most of his compositions originally written in Urdu, but they went first publication was in Hindi
 taintis varshon ke rachanaatmak jivan main ve sahitya kii aisi viraasat saunp gaye jo gunon kii drushti se amuly he or aakaar kii drushti se aseemit
 Premchand's composition and vision came in various literary forms
 bahumukhi pratibha sampann premchand ne upanyaas, kahani, naatak, samiksha, lekh, sampadakeey, sansmaran aadi anek vidhaon main sahitya kii sristi kii
 He was prominently known as a storyteller and during his lifetime he was awarded the title of 'novel Emperor'
 unhone kul 15 upanyaas, 300 se kuch adhik kahaniyaan, 3 naatak, 10 anuwaad, 7 bal-pustaken tathaa hajaaron prishthon ke lekh, sampadakeey, bhaashan, bhoomika, patr aadi kii rachana kii lekin jo yash or pratishtha unhen upanyaas or kahaniyon se praapt hui, vah anya vidhaon se praapt na ho saki
 This situation appears equally in both Hindi and Urdu languages
 premchand ke upanyaas na keval hindi upanyaas sahitya main balki sampurna bhartiya sahitya main mile ke pathar hai
 Premchand first begins his novelist in fiction
 unka pehla urdu upanyaas ‘asaraare maaabid urf devsthan rahasy’ urdu saptahik ‘'aawaaj-e-khalq'’ main 8 oktober, 1903 se 1 farvari, 1905 tak dharawahik rup main prakashit hua
 His second novel 'hamkhurma aur Humswab', a Hindi adaptation of which was published in 1907 under the name 'prema'
 chunki premchand mul rup se urdu ke lekhak the or urdu se hindi main aae the, isliye unke sabhi aarambhik upanyaas mul rup se urdu main likhe gaye or baad main unka hindi tarjuma kiya gaya
 He entered the world of Hindi novel from the novel 'sevasadan'
 yah mul rup se unhone 'bajaare-husn' naam se pehle urdu main likhaa lekin iskaa hindi rup 'sevasadan' pehle prakashit karaayaa
 'sevasadan' is the story of a woman becoming a prostitute
 dow ramvilas sharma ke anusaar 'sevasadan' main vyakt mukhya samasya bhartiya nari kii paradheenata he
 After this came his first novel 'premashram' on peasant life
 iskaa masauda bhi pehle urdu main 'goshaae-aafiyat' naam se taiyaar hua tha lekin 'sevasadan' kii bhaanti ise pehle hindi main prakashit karaayaa
 'premashram' is probably the first novel in Hindi written on peasant life
 yah avadh ke kisaan andolanon ke daur main likhaa gaya
 After this, the journey through 'rangbhoomi', 'rejuvenation', 'nirmala', 'drone', 'karmabhoomi' was completed to 'godan'
 rangabhumi main premchand ek andhe bhikhaari surdaas ko katha kaa nayak banaakar hindi katha sahitya main krantikari badlaav kaa sutarapaat kar chuke the
 Godan has an important place not only in Hindi literature but also in world literature
 isamen premchand kii sahitya sambandhi vichaardhaara 'aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad' se 'aalochanatmak yatharthwaad' tak kii purnataa praapt karti he
 Creating a common peasant hero of the novel was like to change the course of the novel tradition
 samantvaad or poonjeevaad ke chakra main funskar hui kathanayake hori kii mrityu pathakon ke jahan ko jhakzor kar rakh jaati he
 In his previous novels 'premashram' and 'karmabhoomi' on peasant life, while presenting the Premchand reality, he embraces the ideal till the end of the novel
 lekin godaan kaa kaarunik ant is baat kaa gavaah he ki tab tak premchand kaa adarshavaad se mohabhang ho chukaa tha
 This can also be seen in his last period stories
 'mangalsutra' premchand kaa adhuraa upanyaas he
 The original story of Premchand's novels was Indian rural life
 premchand ne hindi upanyaas ko jo oonchaai pradaan kii, vah parvarti upanyaaskaaron ke liye ek chunauti bani rahi
 Premchand's novels were translated into many languages of India and the world, especially his most popular novel Godan
 inaki adhiktar kahaniyon main nimna va madhyam varg kaa chithran he

 Popular stories of Premchand ji premchand ne 'sangram', 'karbala' or 'prem kii vedi' naatakon kii rachana kii
 These plays are good at the level of craftsmanship and compassion, but their stories and novels have attained such a height that Premchand did not get much success in the field of drama
 ye naatak vastutah sanvadatmak upanyaas hi ban gaye hai
 Premchand was not only a sensitive storyteller, but also a vigilant citizen and editor
 unhone 'hans', 'maadhuri', 'jaagran' aadi patr-patrikaon kaa sampadan karte hue va tatkaaleen anya sahagaami saahitiyik patrikaon 'chaand', 'maryaada', 'swadesh' aadi main apni saahitiyik va saamaajik chintaaon ko lekhon yaa nibandhon ke madhyam se abhivyakt kiya

 premchand ke lekh prakaashan santhaan se 'kuch vichaar' sheershak se bhi chape hai
 Premchand's famous writings include the following articles - Purpose of Literature, Old Age New Age, Benefits of Swaraj, Story Art, Some thoughts about the Qaumi language, Unity of hindi-urdu, Mahajani Civilization, Upanayas, Literature in life

 The Hindi translation of 'fasan-e-azad', the Urdu novel of Ratannath Sarshar, by him, 'azad Katha' became very famous
 premachand urdu kaa sanskaar lekar hindi main aae the or hindi ke mahaan lekhak bane
 Gave Hindi its special idiom and openness
 kahani or upanyaas dono main ugantarkari parivartan kiye
 He established a strong urge for timeliness in literature
 aam aadmi ko unhone apni rachanaaon kaa vishay banaaya or uski samasyaon par khulkar kalam chalaate hue unhen sahitya ke nayakon ke pad par asin kiya
 Before Premchand, Hindi literature was entangled in the stories of the king-queen, the thrill
 premchand ne sahitya ko sachai ke dharaatal par utaara
 He brought out the truth of life and time
 ve sampradayikta, bhrashtachar, jameendaari, karjakhori, garibi, upniveshwaad par aaajeevan likhte rahe
 Most of Premchand's compositions tell the story of his poverty and poverty
 ye bhi galat nahin he ki ve aam bhartiya ke rachanaakaar the
 He became a hero in his creations, which Indian society deemed untouchable and disgusting
 unhone saral, sahaj or aam bol-chaal kii bhashaa kaa upyog kiya or apane pragatisheel vichaaron ko dridhtaa se tark dete hue samaaj ke saamne prastut kiya
 Presiding over the first conference of the Progressive Writers Association in 1936, he said that the writer is progressive by nature and he who is not, is not a writer
 premchand hindi sahitya ke yug pravartak hai
 He started a new tradition of idealistic realism in Hindi story
 itane mahaan rachanaakaar hone ke baavjood premchand kaa jivan aaropon se mukt nahin he
 Kamalkishore Goenka, a scholar of Premchand, in his book 'premchand: New Directions of Study', tried to reduce the importance of his literature by making some allegations on Premchand's life
 premchand par lage mukhya aarope hai- premchand ne apni pehali patni ko bina vajah choda or duusare vivaah ke baad bhi unke anya kisi mahila se sambandh rahe, premchand ne 'jaagran vivaad' main vinodashankar vyas ke saath dhokhaa kiya, premchand ne apni press ke varisht karmchaaree pravasilal verma ke saath dhokhaadhadi kii, premchand kii press main mazdooron ne hadtaal kii, premchand ne apni beti ke biimaar hone par jhaad-phoonk kaa sahaara liya aadi
 These allegations made by Kamalkishore Goenka do bring to us a side of Premchand's life, which reveals his human weaknesses but the evaluation of his extensive literature has no effect on these allegations
 premchand ko praayah "munshi premchand" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 When and how did 'munshi' become associated with Premchand's name? Most of the people in this subject believe that Premchand was a teacher in the beginning
 adhyapakon ko praaia: us samay munshi ji kaha jaataa tha
 Apart from this, there has been a tradition of putting the word 'munshi' as a form of honor before the names of Kayasthas
 sambhavat: premchand ji ke naam ke saath munshi shabd judakar rudh ho gaya
 According to Professor Shukdev Singh, Premchand never used the word 'munshi' himself in front of his name
 unka yah bhi maananaa he ki munshi shabd sammaan suchak he, jise premchand ke prashansakon ne kabhi laga diya hoga
 This fact is based on conjecture
 lekin premchand ke naam ke saath munshi visheshan judane kaa pramanik kaaran yah he ki 'hans' naamak patr premchand evam 'kanhaiyalaal munshi' ke sah sampadan main nikalataa tha
 On some copies of which Kanhaiyalal Munshi's full name was not printed, but 'munshi' was printed and also Premchand's name was printed in this way
 sampadakmunshi, premchand'hans ke sampadak premchand tathaa kanhaiyalaal munshi the
 But over time, the readers accepted 'munshi' and 'premchand' as one and became 'premchand' - 'munshi Premchand'
 yah swaabhaavik bhi he
 The general reader often reads the author's works, not seeing the subtlety of the name
 aaj premchand kaa munshi alankaran itnaa rudh ho gaya he ki maatr 'munshi' se hi premchand kaa bodh ho jaataa he tathaa 'munshi' na kehane se premchand kaa naam adhuraa-adhuraa sa lagata he
 Premchand did many experiments to reach the pinnacle of his art
 jis yug main premchand ne kalam uthaai thi, us samay unke peeche aisi koi thos viraasat nahin thi or na hi vichaar or pragatishiltaa kaa koi model hi unke saamne tha sivaay bangla sahitya ke
 At that time Bankim was Babu, Sharat Chandra and in addition there were Russian writers like Tolstoy
 lekin hote-hote unhone godaan jaise kaaljayi upanyaas kii rachana kii jo ki ek aadhunik clasik mana jaataa he
 He coined and shaped things himself
 jab bharat kaa swatantraaa andolan chal rahaa tha tab unhone katha sahitya dwaara hindi or urdu donon bhashaaon ko jo abhivyakti di usne siyaasi sargarmi ko, josh ko or andolan ko sabhi ko ubhaara or use taaqatvar banaaya or isse unka lekhan bhi taaqatvar hota gaya
 Premchand can certainly be called the first progressive writer of Hindi in this sense
 1936 main unhone pragatisheel lekhak sangh ke pehle sammelan ko sabhapati ke rup main sambodhan kiya tha
 His speech became the basis of the manifesto of the progressive movement
 premchand ne hindi main kahani kii ek parampara ko janm diya or ek puri peedi unke kadamon par aage badi, 50-60 ke dashak main renu, nagarjun auki inke baad shrinath singh ne gramin parivesh kii kahaniyaan likhi hai, wo ek tarah se premchand kii parampara ke taratamya main aati hai
 Premchand was a revolutionary creator, he saw not only patriotism but also many evil practices prevalent in the society and put them before the people through the story
 unhone us samay ke samaaj kii jo bhi samasyaayen thim un sabhi ko chitrit karne kii shuruyaat kar di thi
 Dalits also come in it, women also
 ye sabhi vishay aage chalakar hindi sahitya ke bade vimarsh bane

 This book was first published in 1944, but its importance in the field of literature can be gauged from the fact that it was revised and published again in 2005, the work was done by his grandson Prabodh Kumar

 mohenjodaro, kalibanga, lothal, dholavira, rakhigadhi or hadappa iske pramukh kendra the
 In December 2014, Bhirdana is considered the oldest discovered city of the Indus Valley Civilization so far
 british kaal main hui khudaayiyon ke aadhaar par puratatvvetta or itihaaskaaron kaa anumaan he ki yah atyant viksit sabhyataa thi or ye shahar anek baar based or ujde hai
 For the first time in the 7th century, when people excavated the soil for eto in the province of Punjab, they found it made from what people believed to be the miracle of God and used it to build a house
 Then in 1826 Charles Massen first made this old Discovered civilization
 kaningham ne 1856 main is sabhyataa ke bare main surveykshan kiya
 During the construction of the railway line from Karachi to Lahore in 1856, the Burton brothers informed the Harappan site to the government

 In 1921 Dayaram Sahni excavated Harappa
 is prakaar is sabhyataa kaa naam hadappa sabhyataa rakhaa gaya va dayaram saahani ko iskaa khojakarta mana gaya

 Due to the use of bronze for the first time, it is also called Bronze Civilization
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke 1400 kendron ko khoja ja sakaa he jisamen se 925 kendra bharat main he
 80 percent of the site is in the vicinity of the Saraswati River and its tributaries
 abhi tak kul khojon main se 3 pratishat sthalon kaa hi utkhanan ho paaya he
 The area of indus Valley Civilization was very wide
 hadappa or mohenjodaro kii khudaai se is sabhyataa ke pramaan mili hai
 Therefore, scholars named it the Indus Valley Civilization, as this area falls in the area of indus and its tributaries, but later the remains of this civilization were also found in areas like Ropar, Lothal, Kalibanga, Vanamali, Rangapur etc
 His tributaries were out of the area
 atah kai itihaaskaar is sabhyataa kaa pramukh kendra hadappa hone ke kaaran is sabhyataa ko "hadappa sabhyataa" naam dena adhik uchit maanate hai
 In 1924 John Marshall, director general of the Archaeological Department, wrote three important texts about the Indus civilization
 is sabhyataa kaa kshetra sansar kii sabhi pracheen sabhyataaon ke kshetra se anek guna bada or vishaal tha
 The centers of this mature civilization were in Punjab and Sindh
 tatpashchaat iskaa vistaar dakshin or purv kii disha main hua
 Thus, under Harappan culture, Punjab was not only a part of Sindh and Baluchistan, but also the marginal parts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh
 iskaa failaav uttar main rahamandheri se lekar dakshin main daimabad tak or pashchim main baluchistan ke makraan samudr tat ke sutkagendoor se lekar uttar purv main meerut or kurukshetra tak tha
 In the initial expansion that was received, the entire area was triangular in this way, this area is not only bigger than modern Pakistan, it is bigger than ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia
 isa purv teesri or duusari sahastrabdi main sansar bhar main kisi bhi sabhyataa kaa kshetra hadappa samskruti se bada nahin tha
 So far, a total of 1000 sites of this culture have been discovered in the Indian subcontinent
 inamen se kuch aarambhik avasthaa ke hai to kuch paripakv avasthaa ke or kuch uttarvarti avasthaa ke
 There are fewer places with a mature state

 Two of these cities are very important - Harappa of Punjab and Mohne of Sindh

 The major cities of the Indus Valley Civilization in three countries are as follows: - bharat ke vibhinn rajyon main sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nimna shahar he:- The most special thing about this civilization was the developed city building scheme here
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado dono nagaron ke apane durg the jahaan shaasha varg kaa parivaar rahata tha
 Each town had a lower level city outside the fort where ordinary people lived in brick houses
 in nagar bhawanon ke bare main vishesh baat ye thi ki ye jaal kii tarah vinyast the
 That is, roads used to cut each other at right angles and the city was divided into many rectangular blocks
 ye baat sabhi sindhu bastiyon par lagu hoti thim chaahe ve choti hon yaa badi
 The buildings of Harappa and Mohan Jodaro were large
 vahaan ke smarak is baat ke pramaan hai ki vahaan ke shaasha majdoor jutaney or kar-sangrah main param kushal the
 Seeing the big building of bricks, even the common people will feel how majestic and dignified these rulers were
 mohan jodado kaa ab tak kaa sabase prasiddh sthal he vishaal saarvajanik snanagar, jiskaa jalashay durg ke tile main he
 This is a beautiful example of brick architecture
 yah 11

 There are stairs to the floor at both ends
 bagal main kapade badalane ke kamare hai

 Kalibangan also has brick platforms in the south part of the city which may have been made for the cellars
 is prakaar yah spasht hota he ki kothaar hadappa samskruti ke abhinn ang the
 The use of brick in Harappan culture cities is a special thing, because in the buildings of Egypt at the same time, only dry brick was used in the sun

 yahaan ke wanon se inte pakaane or imaarat banane ke liye lakdi bade paimaane par istemaal main laai gai jiske kaaran dhire dhire wanon kaa vistaar simatata gaya
 One of the reasons for the fertility of Indus was the floods coming from the Indus River every year
 gaanv kii raksha ke liye khadi paki eent kii diwaar ingit karti he baadh har saal aati thi
 People here used to sow seeds in the flood plains in the month of November after the floods subsided and harvested wheat and barley in April before the next flood
 yahan koi fawda yaa phal to nahin mila he lekin kalibangan kii prak-hadappa sabhyataa ke jo koont mili hai unase abhas hota he ki rajasthan main is kaal main hal jote jate the

 An idol depicts a plant growing out of a woman's womb
 vidwaanon ke mat main yah prithvi devi kii pratimaa he or iskaa nikat sambandh paudhon ke janm or vruddhi se rahaa hoga
 Therefore, it seems that people here considered the earth to be the goddess of fertility and worshiped it in the same way as the Egyptians of Isis, the goddess of the Nile River
 lekin pracheen misr kii tarah yahaan kaa samaaj bhi matra pradhan tha ki nahin yah kahana mushkil he

 Pictures of Swastik are also found here
 kuch vidwaan maanate he ki hindu dharm dravido kaa mul dharm tha or shiv dravido ke devtaa the jinhen aaryon ne apana liya

 pracheen misr or mesopotamia main puratatvavidon ko kai mandiron ke avshesh mili he par sindhu ghati main aaj tak koi mandir nahin mila, marshall aadi kai itihaaskaar maanate he ki sindhu ghati ke log apane gharo main, kheto main yaa nadi kinare puja kiya karte the, par abhi tak keval brihatsnanagar yaa vishaal snanaghar hi ek aisa smarak he jise poojasthal mana gaya he

 Our memories are a major part of our personality
 ham kya yaad rakhte hai or kya bhul jate he yah sab bahut sari chizon par nirbhar karata he
 Memory, like language, vision, hearing, perceptiveness, learning and meditation, is also a major intellectual ability of the brain
 hamaare mastishk main jo kuch bhi anubhav, soochna or gyaan ke rup main sangrahit he vah sabhi smriti ke hi vividh roopon main vyavasthit rahata he
 The study of this ability of the human brain is a fairly broad subject matter
 mukhyatah iskaa adhyayan manovigyaan, tantrikavigyaan evam ayurvigyaan ke antargat kiya jaataa he
 In the article presented, various forms of memory, its biological basis, major memory related diseases and some major memory tips will be highlighted
 hamaari smriti kaise kaam karti he yaa phir kisi bhi cheez ko ham kaise yaad rakh pate hai? smriti hamaare mastishk main kis prakaar sangrahit hoti he? ham kisi cheez ko kyon bhul jate hai or kuch chije bhulaae nahin bhuulati
 These fundamental questions have always agitated the human mind and efforts have been made from time to time to answer them
 hamamen se sabhi ke andar puraani baton ko yaad rakhane kii kshamta hoti he
 We keep remembering a person, place, event and situations
 un se kuch sikhte hai
 Then further secure them in the form of experiences and knowledge
 hamaare aage kaa vyavhaar iske dwaara niyantrit hota he ki hamane kya siikhaa he
 Initially, memory was compared to a physical location and the information stored in it was seen as different objects kept in that location
 is upama ko samajhane ke liye ek pustkaalay kaa udhaaharan liya ja saktaa he
 The library represents a physical place ie the entire memory and the books kept in it are like various information
 smriti kii is vyakhya ko lambey samay tak manyata bhi mili
 But later on the basis of logic doubts were raised about its authenticity
 yah dekha gaya ki smriti kii yah vyakhya praarambhik str par to sahi thi lekin yah smriti ke vibhinn prakramon jaise ki kisi puraani ghatana kaa samaran tathaa nai smritiyon ke nirmaan kii uchit vyakhya karne main asafal siddh hui
 More new theories came to understand memory
 inamen se computer vigyaan dwaara prerit siddhant sabase upyukt siddh hua
 This new interpretation of memory was presented on the basis of the neural network model
 iske anusaar smriti hamaare mastishk main ek jagah kendrit hone ke bajaae samaantar rup se vitarit hoti he
 This distribution is made up of microscopic units that are equivalent to a nerve cell
 in ikaayiyon main smriti, ek tarah ke sakriyata praturup main nirupit hoti he
 According to the modern definition, our memory is a collective process which has three main stages
 sabase pehle iske pratham charan main soochnaaon ko kutabaddh kiya jaataa he
 After this, these encrypted information is collected in the second phase and they are recalled in the last phase
 hamen apane aasapaas ke vaataavaran ko mahasoos karne ke liye pehle aavashyak he ki vaataavaraniya uddipano ko usase sambandhit gyanendriyon dwaara grahan kiya jaae
 For example, to see an object, we receive the reflected light from it through the eyes
 ab is paravartit prakaash ko netra kii retina main upasthit samvedi tantrika koshikaayen ksheen vaidyutiya tarango main badalati hai
 It can now be said that the light stimulation in the atmosphere by the retina has been electrified
 ab yah halki vaidyutiya tarang mastishk ke drishy kshetra main jaati he or yahaan isaki vyakhya kii jaati he
 Based on this interpretation, we create a reflection of the front view in our mind
 is samoochee prakriya ko drishy pratyakshikaran yaa dekhnaa kehete hai
 At the time of coding, information is mainly coded based on location, time and frequency
 soochnaaon ko code karne ke baad unke sangrahan kaa sthaan aata he
 This storage can be at the sensory level or short-term memory level or long-term memory level
 yahaan yah ullekhneey hoga ki hamaare mastishk main sangrahan ke samay soochnaaon main thodaa parivartan ho saktaa he
 Meaning that the notifications will not remain as they were in the real world
 unamem ham apane paas se kuch mila sakate he yaa phir us soochna ke kisi bhaag ko nikaal bhi sakate hai
 If there is half the incomplete information, then we can also build it on the basis of our imagination
 is gun ke kaaran smriti ek nirmaanatmak prakriya hoti he
 Additional level of memory is classified based on the collection of information in memory
 hamen kaise pataa chalata he ki hamaare paas kisi vishesh samay yaa sthaan kii smriti he? tabhi jab ham use samaran karte hai
 For example, if you ask the names of the five teachers of your childhood, whose teachings have had the greatest impact on your life, we will not be late to answer
 lekin agar yah puuchhen ki varsh 2000 se 2005 tak jaiviki yaa kisi bhi kshetra main nobel puraskaar praapt vaigyanikon ke naam bataaie to shaayad hamen kuch der tak sochna pad jaae
 It becomes clear here that what we remember and what we forget depends a lot on our motivations, conscious and unconscious desires etc
 atah samaran, sampurna smriti kaa ek aavashyak ang he
 Now the question arises that what is the mechanism of different processes of memory? In 1968, to explain the above processes of memory, Atkinson and Siffrin presented an explanation of the multi-layered collection of memory
 is paribhaasha ke anusaar smriti ke teen mukhya sangrah hote hai
 Our senses take the task of taking any information from the environment and passing it to the brain
 baad me us soochna ke aadhaar par mastishk dwaara ek nishkarsh nikaala jaataa he
 We can take the example of cold or heat sensation by seeing, hearing or skin
 koi bhi vaataavaraniya uddipan jaise prakaash yaa dhwani sabase pehle apane sambandhit gyanendriya me bahut hi kam samay ke liye kutabaddh rup main sangrahit hota he
 This storage is for a short time
 drushti ke liye isaki seemaa 0
5 second or shravan ke liye isaki samay seemaa 2 second ke aasapaas hoti he
 After this time limit, this stored memory is lost
 andrik str par suchanaaen abhi praarambhik hoti hai or inase koi nishkarsh nahin nikaal sakate
 Their brain has yet to be combined and scoured
 gyanendriyon dwaara praapt suchanaaen jab hamaare dhyaan main aati hai to ve alpakaaleen smriti kaa bhaag banati hai
 It is worth mentioning here that all the information at the sensory level which we do not pay attention to, ends
 keval vahiin suchanaaen jin par ham ekagra hote he ve alpakaaleen smritiyaan banati hai
 Short-term memory is also called functional memory
 is prakaar kii smriti kaa sarvshereshth udhaaharan hamaare dwaara koi phone number yaad karnaa he
 When we look at a number and dial it, there are two things
 sabase pehle ham nabar ko dekhte hai or use kuch ek baar doharaa ke yaad karte hai phir number dial karne ke baad saamanytah use bhul jate hai
 Hence two conclusions can be drawn regarding this type of memory
 pratham, alpakaaleen smriti kii kshamta bahut kam hoti he dwitiya, is prakaar kii smriti main agar ekaagratha main thodi bhi kami se hamaara dhyaan bant jaae to smriti shesh nahin rah jaati
 In the example of phone, if there is any other thing between remembering and dialing the number, then we will not remember the number
 vaigyanikon ne pataa lagaaya he ki is prakaar kii smriti main soochna kaa kul sangrahan 20 se 30 second tak hi hota he
 But if the information is repeated, this time can be more than 20 to 30 seconds
 or agar baar-baar dhyaan se doharaaen to yah soochna dirghakaalin smriti main parivartit ho jaati he
 As is clear from the name itself, long-term memories are permanent
 ham is smriti kaa upyog bahut tareeko se karte hai
 What did we eat for breakfast this morning? Who came to our house the day before yesterday? What clothes did those people wear? Where and how did we celebrate our last birthday? From how we ride a bicycle to solve a crossword puzzle, this memory supports us in all these activities
 is prakaar kii smriti sabase adhik vividh hoti he or hamaari bhaawanaaon, anubhavon tathaa gyaan ityadi in sabhi rupo main parilakshith hoti he
 Short-term memory information becomes a long-term memory after repeated repetitions
 is smriti kaa kshay nahin hota lekin isamen parivartan ho saktaa he
 Till now, the mechanism of memory was being talked about
 yah prashn abhi baaki he ki hamaara mastishk in soochnaaon ko kaise sangrahit karata he or tantrika tantra kii koun-koun si gatividhiyaan iske liye uttardaai hoti hai
 If memory resides in our brain, then there should be some evidence of its physical representation
 is disha main bahut saare shodh hue hai or iske sandarbh main bahut si vyakhyaayein bhi prastut kii gayi hai
 It was known from the beginning that only biological molecules are responsible for building memory
 sabase pehle 1960 ke dashak main DNA anuon ke vyutpann ke aadhaar par isaki vyakhya karne kii koshish kii gai
 It has been reported that mrna molecules are responsible for the biological representation of memory
 ullekhneey he ki ye mrna anu hamaare jini sandeshon or protein nirmaan ke liye mukhya rup se sambandhit hote hai
 In later years it was observed that this hypothesis of the physical basis of memory is not correct and new inventions are needed to present any idea in this field
 1970 ke dashak main smriti ke bhautik nirupan ke sambandh main kuch nae vichaar aae
 It has been reported that memory is generated in the brain in the form of weak electrical waves and it somehow makes permanent physical changes in the brain's structure at the microscopic level
 yah bhautik parivartan ek nai smriti ko nirupit karata he
 It would be notable for this interpretation that it was based on various experimental tests and was also correct
 lekin yahaan is baat kii vyakhya nahin ho paati thi ki “ksheen vaidyutiya tarange sanrachanaatmak rup se kaise or kya parivartan karti hai
 "in recent years, researches have yielded new information regarding Smriti Jowki
 inke anusaar smriti nirmaan main do pramukh kaarak tantrika rasayan or tantrika koshika ke synapse mukhya bhoomika nibhaate hai
 Researches have indicated that the neurotransmitters responsible for information convection in two nerve cells that are secreted by the synapses repeatedly stimulate a particular neural motif for a particular memory
 falswaroop ek pattern ban jaataa he
 Experiences and repeated attempts may change this pattern slightly
 kisi smriti vishesh ke liye yah pattern sthai hota he
 In other words, there are definite neural patterns for each of our experiences, art, skills, memory, etc
 jab ham kisi ke bare main sochate hai to usase sambandhit praaroop kaam kar rahaa hota he
 When we are solving a question, another format is activated
 ham sabhi ne kisi na kisi samay aisi sthiti kaa saamana kiya hoga jab ham apni yaadasht ko yaad karte hai
 For example, we are going to say something and suddenly forget what to say or all the answers of the question paper are coming in the exam but they are unable to find words to write
 yah smriti lop ke chote-chote udhaaharan hai
 On the other hand you may have noticed that some people complain of forgetting in old age
 ainstine ke bare main ek kahani prachlit he ki ek baar ve apane vishvavidhyalay main tahal rahe the tabhi unke ek vidhyaarthee ne unhen dopaher ke bhojan ke liye poocha
 Einstein asked him from which direction i was coming when you stopped me? The student pointed to one side and told that you were coming from that direction
 tab ainstin ne uttar diya
 Thank you! Then i have eaten food
 aisi bahut si kathaayen darshanikon or vaigyanikon ke sambandh main kahi jaati hai
 This is an example of a small-scale memory loss
 uparokt sabhi ghatnaon main ham dekhte hai ki kahin na kahin se hamaare mastishk kii sugam kriyasheeltaa main rukaawat ho rahi hoti he
 a small amount of memory defects occur in almost everyone but it cannot be named disease
 jab in lakshanon ke kaaran vyakti aurausase jude log prabhavit hone lage tabhi ise smritibhransh kaa naam dete hai
 These types of patients cannot remember the people they met only half an hour ago
 unhe yah bhi yaad nahin rahata ki das minute pehle unhone snaan kiya tha
 The normal actions of life are very badly affected
 smriti lop yaa smriti bhransh, smriti sambandhi ek aisi ghatana he jisamen isse sambandhit kisi bhi prakram jaise samaran yaa sangrahan main baadha utpann ho jaati he or jiske falswaroop hamaari saamaanya smriti prabhavit hoti he
 This obstruction can be caused by any physical or psychological cause such as brain injury or any other cause of damage, disease, nutritional deficiency, shock, excessive alcohol consumption, drug abuse and age
 yahaan smritilop ke kuch mukhya prakaaron kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 Symptoms are seen in people who consume excessive alcohol
 sharaab se lambey samay tak adhik maatra main seven karne se mukhyatah do samasyaayein hoti hai
 One is thiamine vitamin deficiency at dangerous levels and second, some harmful structural changes take place in the brain
 inke falswaroop rogiyon ki smriti buree tarah se prabhavit hoti he
 It is seen that their present-day memory is fine but they are unable to remember the past events and many important memories are completely missing from their memory
 is prakaar ke smriti bhransh main nai suchanaaen yaad karne main kathinaayee hoti he, lekin beeti ghatnaon kii smritiyaan bilkul thik hoti hai
 Such instances are seen that someone has been hurt on a particular part of the brain and after that only he can remember the old things and there is no space left for any new memory after the accident
 iske lakshanon main puraani ghatnaayen to ascharyajanak rup se bhul jaati hai lekin nai ghatnaon se sambandhit smritiyon main koi pareshaani nahin hoti
 Such instances are seen that after an accident, all the old memories are not known where? But there is no difficulty in remembering new information
 is prakaar ke smritilop main smriti kuch dinon main waapas aa jaati he
 It has been observed that sometimes our mind also inspires us to forget some special memories
 or ham unhen puri tarah se bhul bhi jate hai
 Such arrangements have been made by nature to make our present enjoyable
 aisa vishesh taur par bahut hi peedaadaayak smritiyon ke sandarbh main hota he
 For example, a tragic incident in childhood, punishment etc
 yahaan ullekhneey hoga ki ye smritiyaan keval hamaare chetan man se lupt hoti hai
 Somewhere in the deep unconscious, parts of them exist
 ham apane aas-paas aise anek logon ko dekhte hai jinaki smriti kshamta bahut acchhee hoti he
 There are some people who are known for their forgetful nature
 ham main se sabhi sochate hai ki hamaari yaadasht kshamta batch jaae to kitna acha ho
 The main symptom of a good memory is that it arranges all related things in order and ensures their availability immediately when needed
 kuch aisi davaaiyaan uplabdh hai jinase gambhir rup se bhuulane kii sthiti main sahaayta milti he
 But these medicines should be used only in special conditions
 ham kitni acchhee tarah se yaad karte or sikhte hai yah kaaphi kuch hamaare bhaavnaatmak sthiti par nirbhar karata he
 An inspiring environment for learning and understanding is always beneficial
 ham tab bhi behatar tareeke se sikh pate hai jab ham dhyaan dete hai
 It is also necessary how the information is being coded
 iskaa bhandaaran or samekan kis prakaar ho rahaa he or iskaa punah samaran kaise ho rahaa he
 a good memory requires all these actions to go smoothly
 smriti yuktiyaan aisi vyavhaarik vidhiyaan hai jinase smriti kshamta ek had tak badhaai ja sakati he
 We also use them to remember some things unknowingly
 nepolian ke bare main yah kaha jaataa he ki use apni sena ke prayek adhikari kaa naam yaad tha
 People with such unique memory abilities appear to remember almanacs for many years
 ab yah prashn uthta he ki ek saamaanya vyakti ke yaad karne ke tareeke or vishisht smriti sampann logon ke tareekon main kya antar hota he? shodhon dwaara dekha gaya he ki alag-alag vyaktiyon main soochnaaon ke kodikaran, sangrahan or samaran kaa tarika thodaa alag ho saktaa he
 a good memory can either be an innate talent or can be learned later by ordinary people using some special methods
 janmajaat rup se ucch smriti kshamta vaale vyaktiyon main smritiyon kii prakriya thodi jatil hoti he
 It has been observed that some people also have symptoms of synesthesia
 sinesthesia ko samajhane ke liye kaha ja saktaa he ki aise log dhwani ko sunne ke saath saath dekhte or drishyon ko dekhne ke saath sunate bhi hai
 So they can use the visual capacity of the brain as well as the hearing capacity to see something
 udhaaharan ke liye ek komal madhur dhwani unke liye ek sundar rangon kaa samooh bhi ho saktaa he or ek kathor dhwani ke liye gahare tej chubte hue rang bhi ho sakate hai
 Symptoms of synesthesia may also occur for other sensory abilities such as touch, olfaction, etc
 smriti ko prabhaavshaalee banane ke liye anya bhi bahut sari smriti yuktiyaan prayog kii jaati hai
 Such as recalling already stored memory by adding new information, remembering the same information by putting it together, turning any information into an interesting story, etc
 jatil paathya saamagree ko samajhane ke liye ek or vidhi SQ3R bahut hi upyogi hoti he
 In this, we first prepare a blueprint of the textual content in mind, then make some questions based on "what, why and how" by itself
 ab in prashnon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue paathya saamagree ko dhyaan purvak padhaa jaataa he or phir use kram se dubaara padhate hai
 Finally it is reviewed by the reader
 acchhee smriti ke liye acha maansik or shaareerik swasthya jaruri he
 Along with this, emotional attachment to what is being read is also necessary
 kuch ekaagratha badhaane vaali vidhiyaan jaise ki dhyaan or pranayam aadi bhi smriti kii kshamta badhaane main bahut upyogi siddh hui hai

 Kasturba Gandhi, wife of Mahatma Gandhi who is famous in India as Ba
 kasturba gandhi kaa janm 11 april san 1869 i
 main mahatma gandhi kii tarah kathiyawad ke porbandar nagar main hua tha
 In this way Kasturba was 6 months older than Gandhiji in Gandhi's age
 kasturba gandhi ke pita 'gokuldaas makanji' saadhaaran sthiti ke vyapaaree the
 Kasturba was the third child of Gokuldas Makanji
 us jamaane main koi ladakiyon ko padhaata to tha nahin, vivaah bhi alpavay main hi kar diya jaataa tha
 Therefore, Kasturba was also illiterate as a child and at the age of seven she was engaged to 6-year-old Mohandas
 teraa saal kii aayu main un donon kaa vivaah ho gaya
 Bapu tried to keep a check on them from the beginning and wanted Kasturba not to go anywhere without permission from them, but the more she pressed them the more she would get freedom and go wherever she wanted
 pati-patni 1888 i
 tak lagbhag saath-saath hi rahe kintu baapu ke england pravaas ke baad se lagbhag agle baarah varsh tak donon praaia: alag-alag se rahe
 Bapu had to leave for Africa shortly after returning from England
 jab 1896 main ve bharat aae tab ba ko apane saath le gaye
 Since then, she has been following the footsteps of Bapu
 unhone unki tarah hi apane jivan ko sada bana liya tha
 She was always with him in Bapu's religious and civil services
 yahi unke saare jivan kaa saar he
 In many of Bapu's fasts, Baa was often with him and kept his essence
 jab 1932 main harijanon ke prashn ko lekar baapu ne yarvada jail main aamaran upwas aarambh kiya us samay ba sabarmati jail main thim
 At that time she became very restless and got rested only when she was sent to Yerwada Jail
 dharm ke sanskaar ba main gahare paithe hue the
 She was not ready to corrupt the Manus body by consuming meat and alcohol at any stage
 africa main kathin beemaari kii avasthaa main bhi unhone maance kaa shorwa pinaa asweekaar kar diya or aaajeevan is baat par drudh raheen
 In South Africa, in 1913, a law was passed that recognized marriages other than those conducted in accordance with Christianity and recorded with the marriage department official
 duusare shabdon main hindu, musalmaan, parsi aadi logon ke vivaah avaidh qaraar die gaye or aisi vivaahit striyon kii sthiti patni kii na hokar rakhel sareekhee ban gai
 Bapu tried hard to get this law canceled
 par jab ve safal na hue tab unhone satyagrah karne kaa nishchay kiya or usamen sammilit hone ke liye striyon kaa bhi aahvaan kiya
 But he discussed this matter with other women but did not discuss it with Ba
 ve nahin chaahate the ki ba unke kehane se satyagraiyon main jaayan or phir baad main kathinaaiyon main padakar visham paristhiti upasthit karen
 They wanted them to go free and go if they persevered
 jab ba ne dekha ki baapu ne unase satyagrah main bhaag lene kii koi charchaa nahin kii to badi du:khee hui or baapu ko upalambh diya
 Swetchaya then joined the Satyagraha and jailed along with three other women
 jail main jo bhojan mila vah akhaadya tha at: unhone falahar karne kaa nishchay kiya
 But when his request was not heeded, he started fasting
 nidaan paanchaven din adhikariyon ko jhukna padaa
 But the fruits given were not enough for the whole meal
 at: ba ko teen maheene jail main aadhe pet bhojan par rahanaa padaa
 When she got out of jail, her body was left stagnant
 dakshin africa main jail jane ke sivaa kadachit vahaan ke kisi saarvajanik kaam main bhaag nahin liya kintu bharat aane ke baad baapu ne jitne bhi kaam uthaae, un sabamein unhone ek anbhavi sainik kii bhanti haath bantaya
 During the Satyagraha of Champaran, Ba also lived in Tiharwa village and roamed in the villages and distributed medicines
 unke is kaam main nilhe goron ko raajnneeti kii bu ai
 He set up their hut in Ba's absence
 ba kii us jhopadi main bachche padhate the
 He did not like to close this chatsala even for a day, so he woke up all night and set up another hut of grass
 isi prakaar kheda satyagrah ke samay ba striyon main gum ghumkar unhen utsahit karti rahi
 The statement he gave when Bapu was arrested in 1922 and was sentenced to six years, distinguished him as a heroine
 unhone gandhi ji ke giraftaar ke virodh main videshi kapadon ke tyaag ke liye logon kaa aahvaan kiya
 Like youths, they roamed the villages of Gujarat to tell Bapu's message
 1930 main dandi kooch or dharasana ke dhaave ke dinon main baapu ke jail jane par ba ek prakaar se baapu ke abhaav kii purti karti raheen
 She was patient, assisting the people suffering from the atrocities of the police
 1932 or 1933 kaa adhikansh samay unka jail main hi beetaa
 In 1939, Thakur Saheb of Rajkot agreed to give certain rights to the subjects, but later retracted
 janata ne iske viruddh apana virodh prakat karne ke liye satyagrah karne kaa nishchay kiya
 When Ba heard this, he felt that Rajkot was his own house
 vahaan hone vaale satyagrah main bhaag lenaa unka kartavya he
 He obtained Bapu's permission for this and as soon as he reached Rajkot, he was put under house arrest in a case of civil disobedience
 pehle unhen ek ekant sunsaan main based gaanv main rakhaa gaya jahaan kaa vaataavaran unke tanik bhi anukool na tha
 The public agitated that their health is not good, it is inhuman to keep them away from medical facilities
 falat: ve rajkot se 10-15 mile dur ek rajmahal main rakhi gayin
 Shortly after Ba's departure, Bapu also decided to participate in Satyagraha and started fasting there
 jab ba ko isaki khabar mili to unhone ek samay hi bhojan karne kaa nishchay kiya
 She always used to do this during Bapu's fast
 do teen din baad hi rajkot sarkaar ne yah bhulaava dekar ki ve baapu se milanaa chahen to ja sakati hai, unhen baapu ke paas bhej diya
 But when no one came to take them back to the place of detention in the evening, it was found that they had been released from this deception
 baapu ko yah sahya na tha
 He sent Ba back to jail at one o'clock in the night
 rajkot sarkaar kii himmat na hui ki vah sari raat unhen sadak par rahane de
 She was taken back to the palace and thereafter she was released the next day
 9 agast 1942 ko baapu aadi ke giraftaar ho jane par ba ne, shivaji park main, jahaan swayan baapu bhaashan dene vaale the, sabha main bhaashan karne kaa nishchay kiya kintu park ke dwaar par pahunchne par giraftaar kar lee garin
 Two days later, she was sent to the Aga Khan palace in Poona
 baapu giraftaar kar pehle hi vahaan bheje ja chuke the
 She was unwell at that time
 15 agast ko jab ekaek mahadev desai ne mahaprayan kiya to ve baar baar yahi kahati raheen mahadev kyon gaya; main kyon nahin? baad main mahadev desai kaa chitasthaan unke liye shankar-mahadev kaa mandir sa ban gaya
 She would regularly go there, praying for samadhi and greeting him
 ve usapar deep bhi jalawaatin
 His health deteriorated again on the night of his arrest and he did not improve satisfactorily and finally he finished his career on 22 February 1944
