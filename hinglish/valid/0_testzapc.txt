 Twain played supporting singers in her Too Hot To Handle song
 He recorded an experimental song with Cyril Rawson, which was unsuccessful
 Part of the reason was Twain's desire to make a rock singer and not a regional singer
 Five months later, she returned to Canada and moved to a flat in downtown Kirkland with Ballet
 vahaan par ve ek rock keybordvadak erik lembear or drum vadak rendi yarako se mili or unhone ek nayaa band banaaya jiske teen maheene baad ve toronto ke sameep bomenville main aa gayi

 Aryashtangam Marg is one of the major teachings of Mahatma Buddha, which has been described as a means of attaining freedom from suffering and self-knowledge
 ashtaang maarg ke sabhi 'maarg', 'samyak' shabd se armbh hote hai 
 In Buddhist symbols, ashtanga passages are often represented by the eight todos of the Dharmachakra
 kii shrenee kaa hissaa According to Buddhism, the Arya Ashtanga Path of the Fourth Arya Truth is - the way to get rid of sorrow
 gautam buddha kehete the ki chaar arya satya kii satyata kaa nishchay karne ke liye is maarg kaa anusaran karnaa chahie : Some people consider the Arya Ashtanga Marg as a path, in which to move forward, it is necessary to attain the level of the previous
 or logon ko lagata he ki is maarg ke str sab saath-saath paae jate he
 The route is classified into three parts: Pragya, Sheel and Samadhi
 bhagavan buddha ne bataaya ki trishna hi sabhi du:khon kaa mul kaaran he
 Due to craving, man tends towards different things in the world; And when he cannot get them or when they are destroyed even after receiving, then he feels sad
 trishna ke saath mrityu praapt karanevaala praani uski prerana se phir bhi janm grahan karata he or sansar ke du:khachakr main pisataa rahata he
 Therefore, the way to satisfy Trishna completely is the path to salvation
 ise du:kha-nirodh-gamini pratipada kehete hai
 Lord Buddha has given eight parts of this path: is maarg ke pratham do ang pragna ke or antim do samadhi ke hai
 The middle four are of modesty
 is tarah sheel, samadhi or pragna inhen teen main aathon angon kaa sannivesh ho jaataa he
 Only when modesty is pure can one enter into spiritual life
 shuddh sheel ke aadhaar par mumukshu dhyanabhyas kar samadhi kaa laabh karata he or samadhisth avasthaa main hi use satya kaa saakshaatkaar hota he
 This is called Pragya, as soon as it becomes enlightened, the seeker is interviewed with the impermanent, anonymous and sad nature of mere power
 pragna ke alok main iskaa agyanandhkaar nasht ho jaataa he
 This leaves all the desires of the world
 vitatrishna ho vah kahin bhi ahankaar mamkaar nahin karata or sukh du:kha ke bandhan se upar uth jaataa he
 Due to the absence of craving for the difference of this life, there is no one to take birth again
 is prakaar, sheel-samadhi-pragnawala maarg aath angon main vibhakt ho arya aashtangik maarg kaha jaataa he

 bhautikee main saral yantra yaa saral mashin un sabhi yuktiyon ko kehete hai jinako chalaane ke liye keval ek hi bal kaa prayog karnaa hota he
 When a force is applied on it, there is mechanical work and displacement of a body for a fixed distance
 koi kaary karne ke liye aavashyak kaary kii maatra niyat hoti he parantu is kaary ke liye aavashyak bal kii maatra kam kii ja sakati he yadi yah alpatar bal adhik duuri tak lagaaya jaay; arthath samaan kaary karne hetu do vikalp hai- Generally, the following 6 tips are called 'simple machines' by Renaissance scientists - utpaadit bal evam lagaaye gayi bal ke anupaat ko yantric laabh kehete hai
 For example, the mechanical advantage of a lever is equal to the ratio of its two sides
 isi prakaar kisi nat tal kaa yantric laabh cos ke baraabar hota he jahaan theta nat tal kaa kshaitij se jhukaav kaa kone he
 Although the method of working of each simple machine is different, but the method of working them mathematically is the same
 dhyaan dene yogya baat yah he ki har mashin main koi bal f i n { \ displaystyle F_{in}}, mashin ke kisi sthaan par lagaaya jaataa he or yah mashin kisi anya sthaan par f o u t { \ displaystyle F_{out}}, bal utpann karte hue koi kaary karti he
 Some machines like pulley etc
 only allow to change the direction of force, but other machines work to increase / decrease the magnitude of the applied force by a coefficient
 isi gunank ko yantric laabh bhi kaha jaataa he jo mashin kii jyamiti se nirdhaarit hota he
 In simple machines there is no source of energy, so they cannot do more work than the work done by the charged force
 yadi mashin ke kalpurjon main lagale vaale gharshan bal ko naganya maane to mashin dwaara lod par kiya gaya kaary, mashin par kiye gayi kaary ke baraabar hogi
 Since work is equal to the product of force and distance, aise yantra jo do yaa adhik saral yantron ke samishran se bane hote hai, mishra yantra yaa sanyukt yantra kehalaate hai
 Such as scissors work using the principles of both the lever and the wedge
 aisi mashine jo kaam kar saktin hai vah kaary saral mashiinon dwaara karnaa kabhi-kabhi asambhav hota he
 Such machines, in which many simple machines are used, are sometimes called complex machines
 jaise cykil, automobile aadi
 Symbolism or totem practice refers to the belief of a society in which humans are considered to be related to an animal, tree, plant or other soul
 'totum' shabd ojibve naamak mul america adivasee qabeele kii bhashaa ke 'ototeman' se liya gaya he, jiskaa matlab 'apana bhai / bahan rishtedaar' he
 Its root word is 'ote' which means brothers and sisters born to the same mother, who have a blood relationship and who cannot marry each other
 aksar totum vaale jaanavar yaa vriksh kaa use maanane vaale qabeele ke saath vishesh sambandh mana jaataa he or use maarna yaa haani pahunchaana varjit hota he, yaa phir use kisi vishesh avasar par yaa vishesh vidhi se hi maaraa ja saktaa he
 Clan people also often include it in clan symbols, for example Native American tribes often displayed it in totem pillars
 bharat ke bahut se samudaayon main bhi aise totum paae jate hai
 For example, it is seen that in Maharashtra people bearing the family name of 'tambe' consider Nag as their totem and never kill Nag
 19veen sadi main satapura ke jangalon main rahane vaale bhil logon main dekha gaya ke har gut kaa ek totum jaanavar yaa vriksh tha, jaise ki patange, saanp, sher, mor, bans, pipal, vakairaah
 The tot of one faction was a creeper named 'gavala', on which if a member of that faction accidentally stepped on it, he saluted him and apologized to him
 agar do guton kaa ek hi totum ho to unamem aapas main vivaah karnaa varjit tha kyonki vah ek hi purvaj ke vanshaj maane jate the
 There was a peacock of the Bhil faction called 'mori'
 iske sadasyon ko mor ke pad-chihnon par pair daalana manaa tha
 If the peacock is seen then, the Mori women would cover it or face it on the other side
 pashu-pakshi, vriksh-paudhon par vyakti, gana, jati yaa janajati kaa namakaran atyant prachlit saamaajik pratha he jo sabhy or asabhy donon prakaar ke samaajon main pain jaati he
 This practice is very prevalent in uncultured societies and sometimes it also has the form of tribal religion
 uttari america ke pashchimi tat par rahanevaali haida, tilliggit, kwakitul aadi janajatiyon main pashu aakaar ke vishaal or bhayanak khambhe paae jate hai, jinhen in jatiyon ke log devtaa maanate hai
 For these, the words Todem, Ododem etc
 are used in these castes, whose sound is in the word totem
 madhya austrailia ke arunta adivasee, africa ke purvi madhya pradeshon tathaa bharat kii janajatiyon main yah pratha prachlit hai
 Different forms of this practice are found in different regions of the world
 parantu itihaaskaaron kaa aisa mat he ki pracheen kaal main kabhi totemiyug rahaa hoga, jiske avshesh aaj ke totemi reeti-rivaaj he
 The names of Raineakh and mclannan are notable among such historians
 is prakaar kii vichaardhaara ke anusaar rainakh ne totemica ke pradhan lakshanon kii ek talika prastut kii
 According to this table, sansar main ganchihnavaad ke lakshan sab kahin ek se nahin paye jate
 For example, iconography is a social practice among the Haida and Tillingit castes, but its religious form is not developed
 madhya austrailia kii arunta jati main totem-dharm or reetiyaan purna viksit hai, totemi pashu kii nakal yaa swaang nahin utaarte
 The religious form of iconography is unattainable in the Bangada caste of Africa
 bharat kii munda, uraanv, santhal aadi jatiyon main totem keval gananaam or ganchihn ke rup main prayukt hota hai
 Traditions of totem-sacrifice and totem-worship are not found there
 adivasee kala par gana kaa prabhaav prachur maatra main miltaa he
 In Chotanagpur and Madhya Pradesh, pictures of totems are seen on the walls of houses
 newjiland ke maori apni naukaaon par apane totem kaa chitra uker dete hai
 In many other tribes, totems are painted on all the clothes, weapons, tools and flags
 visheshat: uttari america or austrailia kii adivasee kala par ganchihn kaa prabhaav bahut gaharaa he
 The members of the totem consider themselves to be supernatural and psychic children of the totem
 ve apane gana main vivaah nahin karte
 Thus the practice of extraterritorialism in totemistic societies is valid
 sar james fckejar kaa vichaar he ki totemwad or bahirvivaah main kaarykaran kaa sambandh he or ve sadaiv saath saath paae jate hai
 The members of the totemi consider blood to be bloodshed due to the totem being a supernatural symbol and do not intermarry for this reason
 bharat main anek totemi jatiyaan hai
 There are more than hundred such ganas in the Santhal caste, whose names are placed on animals, birds and trees
 isi prakaar dakshin bihar kii hi jati main lagbhag pachaas aise totemi gana he
 The Bhils of Rajasthan and Khandesh are divided into 24 ganas, many of which seem to be based on animal herds and trees
 maharashtra ke katakaree, madhyapradesh ke gond or rajasthan ke minaa, milaala aadi jatiyon main bhi ganon ke naam unke pradesh main paae janevaale pashupakshiyon par rakhe jate hai
 Along with the name Totemi Gana, many of the features of totemism are present in all these castes such as treating totem as supernatural ancestors, the objects of the totem and the pictures and signs of the totem are also worshiped as sacred and harsh on destroying the totem
 There is a restriction
 inke saath hi bharat main aisi anek jatiyaan hai jo totem par apane gana athwa samudaay kaa keval naam rakhti he
 There are many who worship only the totem
 majumdaar ne bengal main rahanevaali aisi anek jatiyaan kaa ullekh kiya he
 There are many such castes in Malwa and Rajasthan in which there is no other symptom of totemism except the name
 yah kahana thik nahin hoga ki pashu-pakshi-vrikshon ke poojak sadaiv hi totemvaadi hua karte hai
 In various sects of Hindus, cow, buffalo, monkey, rat, owl, snake, peacock etc
 are worshiped as sacred
 isi prakaar tulsi, bilva, ashwatth or bat kaa pavitra maanakar puujate hai
 But it would be inconsistent to call these sects totemists because they neither name the totem on the totem nor do the members of the guana consider the totem of the totem
 rijgaye kaa vichaar he ki bharat kii ve sab jatiyaan jinamein totemwad kaa ek bhi lakshan paaya jaataa he prarambh main purna rup se totemvaadi thim
 They gradually stopped worshiping their various totems, and now totems are found in them only in the form of Gannam and Ganchaman
