 Tesla's fame is due to his unprecedented contribution to the field of modern alternating current power supply systems
 testla ke vibhinn patent or saidhantik kaary, betaar sanchaar or radio ke vikaas kaa aadhaar sabit huye hai
 Many of his revolutionary development works in the field of electrical magnetism were based on Michael Faraday's principles of electrical technology

 Nicole Tesla was born in a Roman Catholic household, the fourth child of her parents
 unke ek bade bhai, den, do badi bahanon, angenia or milka or ek choti bahan, marika thi
 His father was a pastor in a true Orthodox church, and it was also one of the reasons that the young people of that time did not have much inroads
 jaisaa ki ham jaanate hai ki unke pita ek padri the or ghar main sadasyon kii sankhya bahut adhik thi tab unki kamai ke saath unka ghar tha, unki maa ek gruhinee thi or vah apane parivaar ke paitruk khet kii dekhbhaal or unke khaali samay ke chote gharelu upkarnon kiye gaye the or ham kah sakate hai ki bijli ke avishkaar main tesla ke hit ne apni maa ko prerit kiya tha
 Once Nikola was swinging with his elder brother, his elder brother, Daniel, died before his eyes falling from the swing
 is ghatana ne aath varshiya nicola ko asthir kar diya, jiske kaaran unka maansik santulan puure jivan main bura tha, or jiske kaaran vah bhi bure sapanom kaa istemaal karata tha
 Nicholas's father was an orthodox clergyman and writer, wishing that Nicola was also one who was more interested in pastoral science
 nicola ne graj ke takneekee vishvavidhyalay main ganit or bhautikee kaa adhyayan kiya
 And after receiving a philosophy from the University of Prague, he went to Budapest
 Budapest is the capital of Hungary and the landslide is also the largest city in Nicola, where Tesla arrived there for a few years on the exchange, when Tesla got there, it revealed that new business now The operations did not have and instead a central telegraph office worked as a draftsman
 kuch maheenon ke bheetar, budapest telephone exange shuru kiya gaya tha or testla ko mukhya bijlidaan kaa sthaan diya gaya tha
 During his employment, Tesla made several improvements to the devices and developed an amplifier device
 ise ek lanbaa samay kaha ja saktaa he yahaan unke kaam ke dauraan, unka man sabase pehle preran motor ke vichaar main aayaa, jo ab unki sabase badi avishkaron main se ek he

 jahaan vah pratyaksh vartmaan vidyut sanyantron kii marammat karte the do saal ke liye ek hi pad ke liye kaam karne ke baad, vah america aayaa or hameshaa ke liye based
 Nicola first settled with us in 1884 and while living in the Manhattan area of new York City, where he found himself Edison as an engineer assigned to work in that company, Nicola impressed Edison with his hard work and simplicity
 
 ek din jab nicola karyaalay main kaam kar rahe, edison vahaan aae or nicola ne dekha ki vah kuch ke bare main chintit tha, to unhone samasya ke kaaran kii vyakhya karne ke liye edison se poocha, edison ne majaak main nicola ko bataaya, agar aap dizin main sudhaar karte hai to aap disi dianomas banaate hai to aap $ 5 xxrep 4 0 dete hai us samay vahaan $ 5 xxrep 4 0 kii ek badi raashi thi, jo aaj ke $ 25,000,000 ke baraabar he nicola ne mahasoos kiya ki yah ek acha avasar tha, phir unhone dizin main sudhaar karnaa shuru kiya or unhone din or raat ko ek banaaya or unhone pariyojna ko puraa karne ke liye 19 ghante kaam karnaa shuru kiya or kuch dinon main yah kaam puraa ho gaya
 "but when he asked Edison to give him the money, Edison said," Tesla, you are not able to understand our American humor
 " nicholala is ke saath bahut niraash ho gai or uske dil ko tod diya or uske baad unhone edison kii company ko chhod diya or apni testla electric lite company shuru karne ke asafal prayaas ke baad, or do dinon main khudaai ke liye kaam karnaa shuru kar diya, kuch logon ne nahin suni unke shodhakartaaon kaa samarthan karne ke liye unke samarthakon, lekin 1887 or 1888 main, unke avishkaron ke liye 30 se adhik patent the, jo ki radon main the or american institute par unka kaary karne ke liye bijli ejiniyaron ke samaadhaan ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 His lecture attracted the attention of the inventor of George Westinghouse, who launched the first AC power system near Boston, and Edison's main rival was in the "battle of currents"
 vestinouse ne testla ko kiraye par liya, apane asi motor ke liye patent license praapt kiya or use diya apni prayogshaala lekin edison bahut aisa karke bahut pareshaan ho gaya or unhone nicola par bahut adhik dosha lagaaya
 In the 1890s, Nicola invented high-voltage transformers, known as electric oscillators, meters, improved lighting, and Tesla horoscopes
 unhone ggalilo marconi ke do saal pehle eks-re ke saath prayog bhi kiya, radio sanchaar ke laghu-pradarshan vaale pradarshnon ko pradaan kiya or medisson squaire garden ke ek pool ke aasapaas ek radio-niyantrit naav yojit kiya
 Together, Tesla and Westinghouse published the 1891 World's Columbian Exhibition in Chicago and partnered with general electricity to install AC generators on Niagara Falls, creating the first modern power station

 In finance, the capital asset pricing model is used to determine the desired return rate theoretically appropriate for a capital asset when this asset is to be added to an already well-managed portfolio, and while that asset is Bad risks are known
 is model main parisampatti ke ashaakhneey jokhim jise vitt kshetra main praayah 'beta' ke dwaara pradarshit kiya jaataa he, ko gananaa main liya jaataa he tathaa bazaar ke pratyaashit pratilabh va saidhantik jokhim-mukt parisampatti ke pratyaashit pratilabh ko bhi
 CAMP suggests that the cost of share capital of an investor is determined by 'beta'
 ”:2 is model kaa vistrut rup dwi-beta model he, jo ki urdhvagami beta ko adhigami beta se bhinn karata he
 The concept of CPM was independently presented by Jack Treynor, William Sharpe, John Leintner and Jan Mosin, expanding the work done earlier by Harry Markowitz on diversification and modern portfolio theory

 Fisher Black developed another version of the CPM, the blackcapm, or the zero-beta CPM, which rejected the recognition of risk-free assets i went
 empirical testing main yah sanskaran adhik drudh tha tathaa siepiem kii vaishvik sweekruti main iskaa prabhavi yogadan rahaa
 Despite the advent of many modern methods of pricing and portfolio selection and arbitrage empirical flaws, CAPM is still more prevalent due to its generality and usefulness in a wide variety of circumstances
 siepiem kisi akeli parisampatti athwa parisampattiyon ke samooh kii keemat nirdhaaran karne ke liye ek model he
 For a single security, we use the securities market line and its relationship with expected return and systemic risk to determine how much the price of a single market will be determined by the market compared to its risk category
 pratibhuti bazaar rekha se kisi ek sampatti kii puure bazaar kii tulana main pratifal-jokhim anupaat kii gananaa bhi kii ja sakati he
 Hence, as the expected return of an asset will decrease by its beta coefficient, the return-risk ratio of this single asset will be equal to the return-risk ratio of the entire market
 is prakaar: The market-to-risk ratio is effectively the market risk premium / premium and by re-employing the above equation and assuming E, we get the capital asset pricing model
 jahaan: If this is rewritten from the risk premium point of view, we find that: arthath kisi parisampatti kaa "apana jokhim premium"- "bazaar jokhim premium" va "beta" kaa gunanfal he
 Note 1: The expected market returns are often estimated by taking a geometric average of the value of historical returns in a market-portfolio
 note 2: jokhim kii gananaa hetu prayukt 'jokhim mukt pratifal dar' praayah etihasik daron kaa arithmetic ausat hota he naa ki vartmaan dar
 For the full derivation see Modern portfolio theory
 siepiem ko amaap adhivetan or vishisht jokhim shaamil karne ke liye sanshodhit kiya ja saktaa he
 This is important for investors who do not have an advanced-diversified portfolio
 sameekaran parmparik siepiem sameekaran ke samaan hi he “jisamen bazaar jokhim adhivetan ko beta utpaa or bazaar jokhim adhivetan ke guna se pratisthapit kar diya gaya he:”:5 "where: pratibhuti bazaar rekha siepiem ke formula kaa graph ke rup main chithran karti he
 show the risk on the x axis and the expected return on the y axis
 bazaar jokhim kaa anumaan pratibhuti bazaar rekha kii dhalaan se lagaaya jaataa he
 The relationship between β and expected return is depicted on the securities market line, which represents the expected return as a function of β
 The intercept is the bazaar main uplabdh nominal jokhim mukt dar he, jabaki dhalaan market premium he, E− Rf
 It can be said that the securities market line represents as a single-factor model of the asset price, while β shows how likely it is to be affected by market changes, thus the SML equation is : aisi paristhitiyon ke liye yah ek ati mahatvapurn tul he jab pataa karnaa ho ki kya koi parisampatti / pratibhuti jokhim kii tulana main ek sweekaarya pratifal degi ki nahin
 Solitary assets are depicted on the securities market line graph
 yadi jokhim va pratifal kaa paraspar chithran rekha se upar hota he to iskaa arth he ki yah pratibhuti sasti mil rahi he or is par adhik laabh kii ummid kii ja sakati he
 If it falls below the illustration line, then the price should be considered expensive and it will not get as much profit as the risk is being taken
 siepim kaa upyog karte hue pratyaashit / vaanchhit labhdar e { \ displaystyle E} gyaat hone ke pashchaat isaki tulana sampatti ke anumaanit pratilabh dar se karke yah pataa laga sakate hai ki yah nivesh acha rahegaa ki nahin
 For this we will need to calculate an independent estimate of the return on assets, which is usually done by fundamental or technical analysis, proportional analysis, etc
 siepiem ke anusaar, yadi anumaanit mulya, sampatti ke siepiem dwaara sujhai dar ke saath samyojit kiye gaye bhavishya nakadapravaah ke baraabar he - to sampatti sahi mulya par mil rahi he
 If the estimated value is higher than the CAPM valuation, the property is cheaper
 kisi parisampatti kaa pratibhuti bazaar rekha par sthit nahin hona uske mulya main visangati ko darshata he
 Since the expected return of the property at timepoint t { \ displaystyle t} is e = e - p t p t { \ displaystyle e = { \ frac {E-P_ {t}} {P_ {t xxrep 5 } as suggested by the CAPM If the return exceeds, it means that p t { \ displaystyle P_ {t}} is too low, assuming that at time t + 1 { \ displaystyle t + 1} the asset returns to the CAPM suggested price
 siepiem kaa prayog karne par parisampatti kaa mulya p 0 { \ displaystyle P_{0}}, nimna leniyar sambandh se pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he: Where PT { \ displaystyle P_ {T}} is the payoff of the asset or portfolio
 siepiem dwaara pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kisi vishisht sampatti ke tulanaatmak jokhim ko dhyaan main rakhte hue uski apekshit vaapasi arthath samaayojan dar, kitni honi chahie
 If the value of beta is more than one, it means - above average risk; Less than one means - below average risk
 is prakaar, kisi zyada jokhim vaale stock kaa beta adhik hoga or unhen adhik dar par samyojit kiya jayega
 Whereas less sensitive stocks will have lower beta and will be adjusted at a lower rate

 Because beta is the measure of the vulnerability of a single asset to full market risk, it is clear from the definition that beta will be a measure of market risk: 1
 bazaar jokhim maapne ke liye ek poorak paimaane ke rup main stock market index kaa prayog bahutayat main kiya jaataa he, atah inkaa beta maap 1 hota he
 Thus, investors of a large and well-defined portfolio can expect results from their investments according to market movements
 kisi bhi portpholio main maujuud jokhim pramukhtah do prakaar ke jokhimon kaa yoga hota he - vyavasthaatmak jokhim, jise bazaar jokhim yaa ashaakhneey jokhim bhi kaha jaataa he, tathaa avyavashthaatmak jokhim jise shaakhneey jokhim kaha jaataa he
 Systematic or market risk is due to the factors that affect all investment options, ie the entire market
 is prakaar ke jokhim par niyantran karnaa kathin he
 Disorganized risk is the risk that affects a particular security or investment option
 nivesh kaa vishaakhan karke aise jokhim ko niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk, as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model
 Therefore, the required return on an asset, that is, the return that compensates for risk taken, must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context—i
e
 its contribution to overall portfolio riskiness—as opposed to its "stand alone risk
" In the CAPM context, portfolio risk is represented by higher variance i
e
 less predictability
 In other words the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor
 siepiem maanata he ki kisi nivesh ke jokhim-pratifal anupaat ko durust kiya ja saktaa he, ek adarsh portpholio vah hoga jo ki ek nirdhaarit pratifal dar ke liye nunatam jokhim ke saath ho
 Additionally, as each new asset added to the portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, since each additional asset introduced into a portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, the optimal portfolio must comprise every asset, with each asset value-weighted to achieve the above
 All such optimal portfolios, ie, one for each level of return, comprise the efficient frontier
 Because the unsystematic risk is diversifiable, the total risk of a portfolio can be viewed as beta
 An investor can also invest some part of his fund in risky assets and save some cash, which can be earned at a risk-free rate
 
 Here the ratio of risk-free and risk-free does not determine the overall return - this relationship is definitely linear
 is prakaar se yah sambhav he ki nimna don main se kisi ek prakaar ek nishchit return praapt kiya ja saktaa he : However for a fixed return, only one of the above options would prove to be efficient
 chunki jokhimamukt sampatti paribhaashatah kisi bhi anya sampatti se correlated nahin he, dwitiya vikalp main saamanytah kam vichlan hoga jiske kaaran yah donon main se adhik kushal hoga
 This relationship would also hold true for other portfolios on the effective range: some cash with a higher return - is more efficient - rather than just a portfolio with lower returns at the same return rate
 ek nishchit jokhimamukt dar ke liye, ek hi kushal portpholio hoga jise ki nakadi ke saath milakar kisi bhi pratilabh ke liye nunatam jokhim kii sthiti praapt kii ja sakati he
 This is the market portfolio
 sabhi niveshkon: The bi-beta model distinguishes the upward beta from the overlying beta
 siepiem tathaa dwi-beta model main antar yah he ki siepiem model kii manyata he ki urdhvagami or adhigami beta ek hi hai jabaki dwi-beta model esa nahin maanata
 AC validation is rarely correct, so a bi-beta model is considered more appropriate

 The azo compound is an organic compound that has a RN = NR 'group that can contain r and R' aryl or alkyl
 'aijo' shabd francisi bhashaa ke 'ajot' se aayaa he jiskaa arth nitrogen he
 Azo-benzene is the simplest azo compound
 yah nitrobenzin ko jasta or kshar, sodium paarad mishradhatu or tanu alcohal yaa kshareey stans hydroxide vilyan se avakrut karne par banataa he: On heating equal amounts of aromatic primary amine and nitroso compounds with concentrated acetic acid, azo compounds are formed and water is released: azo yogic adhikanshat: daai azonium lavan ko primary, secondary or tershiri amin, finol yaa fanolic aster se jodakar banaae jate hai
 In this activity, the first di-azonium salts react with primary and secondary aromatic amines to form di-azoamino compounds: daai-azoamino yogic banane ke liye kam khanij amla kii upasthiti main anillin kshar par nitras amla kii abhikriya karai jaati he
 The di-azoamino compounds are yellow-colored alkaline compounds that combine with acids, but also form salts of copper, silver, and potassium, in which this hydrogen bonded to nitrogen is of a moving nature and it differs from one nitrogen atom to another
 Can go to the atom
 iskaa pramaan yah he ki yadi finol azonium lavan ko toludin se joda jaae yaa tolil daai-azonium lavan ko aneleen se joda jaae to donon dasha main ek hi yogic banataa he, anyathaa pehle sanyog main sutara kaa yogic banataa or duusare sanyog main sutara kaa yogic praapt hota: Contains the formula of a real compound in which the more affluent organic tolyl is associated with the basic amino group
 carbonic kshar ko hydrochloride ke saath garam karne par yaa adhik khanij amla kii upasthiti main daai-ezoamino yogic amino-azo yogic main parivartit ho jate hai
 This change occurs from the mercury position, but if a radical is present here, this exchange is from the ortho position
 is kriya dwaara bahut se amino azo ranjak banaae jate hai
 Tertiary aromatic amines bind to di-azonium salts and form amino-azo-compounds directly, with the azo group attached to the mercury location of the tertiary amino group
 daai-anzonium lavan freenol ke kshareey vilyan se sanyog karne par hydraxi azo yogic banate hai
 In this action, di-azoxide is often formed
 finolic aster kii daai-anzonium lavan se judane kii shakti amin or finol se kam he
 For this action, it is necessary that the action be performed in anhydrous state
 isliye praaia: yah kriya sandra aseetic amla main kii jaati he
 Dy-azonium compounds of nitroaniline combine with unsaturated hydrocarbons such as butadiene, and mycetylene
 misitelin, prikramide ke daai-azonium lavan se sanyog karata he or ek azoranjak banaata he
 The combination of di-azonium salts with napthol and naphthalene is particularly important
 elphra-napthol hydraxi samooh ke paara sthaan se judata he, parantu yadi is sthaan par koi samooh upasthit hua to yah sanyog ortho sthaan se hota he
 In beta-naphthol, azo-radical occupies 1 position
 beta-napthil amin main bhi isi prakaar kaa sanyog hota he
 The di-azo-ammonium salt binds to the hydroxy group in the alkaline solution from the amino-hydroxy-amine, but in the acidic solution it combines with the amino group
 is tarah ek hi amino-napthol se vilyan ko kshareey yaa amleey karke vibhinn prakaar ke ranjak banaae ja sakate hai: In principle, there must be two isomeric forms of sis, trans, and azo compounds
 is prakaar ke samaavayavon par abhi adhik khoj nahin hui he
 On shedding light on Transaizo benzene it transforms into sis-form
 sis samaavyavi kaa vartanaank or avasorana gunank trans samaavyavi se bhinn he
 a state of equilibrium is created by the effect of light, with about 27 percent being sis- and 73 percent trans-isomeric
 azo ranjak do prakaar ke hote hai
 One is called alkaline dyes and the other is acidic dyes
 kshareey ranjakon main anillin yalo, bismark brown, jenus red ityadi pramukh hai
 The chemical name of aniline yellow is mercury-amino azobenzene
 yah pile rang kaa ranjak he, jo amla main bangnee rang kaa ho jaataa he
 Bismarck brown is formed by the action of nitrous acid on meta-phenylene-dimen
 is ranjak kaa upyog chamada rangane ke kaam main hota he
 Janus red dyes dyes cotton and wool in acidic heat
 iskaa prayog rui or oon ke mishrit soot tathaa resham ke taage rangane main hota he
 Acidic pigments include methyl orange, alpha-napthol orange, fast red a and B, naphthalene-amine black D, Victoria Violet, etc
 
 chemical compounds of carbon are called carbonic compounds
 prakruti main inaki sankhya 10 lakh se bhi adhik he
 Organic compounds have a very important role in life
 inamen carbon ke saath-saath hydrogen bhi rahata he
 Due to historical and tradition reasons, some carbon compounds are not classified as organic compounds
 inamen carbondioxide, carbon monooxide pramukh hai
 All biomolecules such as carbohydrates, amino acids, proteins, RNA and DNA are organic compounds
 carbon or hydrogen ke yogico ko hydrocarbon kehete hai
 Methane is the hydrocarbon of the smallest molecule
 ethane, propen aadi iske baad aate hai, jinamein kramash: ek ek carbon judata jaataa he
 Hydrocarbons can be divided into three categories: ethane category, ethylene class and acetylene class
 ethane shrenee ke hydrocarbon santrupt hai, arthath inamen hydrogen kii maatra or badhaai nahin ja sakati
 Ethylene has a double bond between two carbons, in acetylene the triple bonded compounds are temporary
 ye aasaani se oxikrut evam hellojanikrut ho sakate hai
 Many derivatives of hydrocarbons can be prepared, which have diverse uses
 aise vyutpann chloride, bromide, iodide, alcohal, sodium alcoxide, amin, maracaptain, nitrate, nitrite, nitrite, hydrogen phosphate tathaa hydrogen sulphate hai
 Unsaturated hydrocarbons are more active and combine with many reactants to form a readily derived derivative
 aise anek vyutpan audyogic drushti se bade mahatv ke siddh hue hai
 Many valuable solvents, plastics, anthelmintic drugs etc
 have been obtained from them
 hydrocarbonon ke oxikaran se alcodaul ether, kitone, aldihide, vasa amla, aster aadi praapt hote hai
 Alcohol can be primary, secondary and tertiary
 inke aster drav sugandhit hote hai
 Many scented liquids can be prepared from them
 isi prakaar aijo yogic ko bhi vibhinn prayogon main liya ja saktaa he

 In ancient times, all systematic thinking was under philosophy, so all the disciplines came in the field of philosophy
 raajnneeti siddhanth ke antargat raajnneeti ke bhinn bhinn pakshon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa hai
 Politics is concerned with public life of human beings
 paramparaagat adhyayan main chintan mulak paddati kii pradhanta thi jisamen sabhi tatwon kaa nirikshan to nahin kiya jaataa hai, parantu tark shakti ke aadhaar par uske saare sambhavit pakshon, paraspar sambandhon prabhaavon or parinaamon par vichaar kiya jaataa hai
 'siddhanta' means a group of logically accumulated and analyzed knowledge
 raajnneeti kaa sarokaar bahut-si chizon se he, jinamein vyaktiyon or samoohon tathaa virgon or rajya ke bich ke sambandh or nyaaypalika, naukarshahi aadi jaisi rajya kii sansthaayen shaamil hai
 David Weld, defining political theory, says- andru haikar kii paribhaasha ke anusaar raajnneetik siddhanth- While giving a broad definition of political theory, Guld and Kolb have stated that 'political theory is a subfield of political science', which includes: ham yah nishkarsh nikaal sakate hai ki buniyadi taur par raajnneetik siddhanth kaa sambandh darshanik tathaa anubhavik donon drushtiyon se rajya kii sanghatana se he
 Attempts are made to clarify, describe and give suggestions regarding the state and political institutions
 nihsandeh, naitik darshanik prayojan kaa adhyayan to usamen antarnihit rahata hi he
 Thinker Weinstein said while filling the ocean in Gagar that political theory is primarily an operation in which questions are asked, answers to those questions are developed and imaginary perspectives are created regarding the public life of human beings
 jo prashn puche jate hai ve kuch is tarah ke hote hai rajya kaa swaroop or prayojan kya he? raajnneetik sanghathan ke saadhyon, lakshyon or paddatiyon ke bare main ham kaise nirnay karen? rajya or vyakti ke bich sambandh kya he or kya hona chahie? itihaas ke puure daur main raajnneetik siddhanth in prashnon ke uttar detaa rahaa he
 It has been considered important because the fate of man depends on what kind of system the rulers and the rulers get and whether the joint action is taken for the common good as a result of that system
 darshan main satya or gyaan kii khoj main kisi bhi vishay par kiye gaye samast chintan kaa samavesh he
 When that search is on political subjects, then we call it political philosophy
 isliye jaruri nahin ki usamen koi siddhanth prastaavit kiya jaae or raajnneetik darshan tathaa raajnneetik siddhanth main yahi antar he
 Thus, political theory is a part of political philosophy, but political philosophy is mostly much broader and does not necessarily include any theory
 is prakaar ham kah sakate hai ki raajnneetik darshan rajya, sarkaar, raajnneeti, swatantraaa, nyaay, sampatti, adhikaron, kanoon or kisi bhi praadhikaran dwaara kanoonee samhita ko lagu karaane aadi se sambandhit prashnon arthath ve kya hai? unki jarurat agar he to kyon he? koun-si baaten kisi sarkaar ko vaid banaati hai, use kin adhikaron or kin swatantraaaon kii raksha kerani chahie or use kyon or koun-sa rup grahan karnaa chahie or kanoon kyon he or kya he or vaid sarkaar ke prati nagarikon ke kartavya yadi hai to kya hai or kab kisi sarkaar ko apdasth kar dena vaid hoga yaa nahin hoga aadi prashnon kaa adhyayan he
 By 'political philosophy' we often refer to a general attitude towards politics or to a specific morality or belief or attitude in relation to it, and not all of it necessarily comes under the entire technical subject of philosophy
 raajnneetik darshan kaa sarokaar aksar samakaleen prashnon se nahin, balki manushya ke raajnneetik jivan ke adhik saarvbhaum prashnon se hota he
 But the political theorist's vision is mainly on contemporary political life and although he is interested in explaining the nature and purpose of the state and similar general questions, he is however interested in political behavior, the actual relationship between the state and the citizens and society
 It is also trying to describe and understand the realities of the role of power
 raajnneeti vigyaan kaa adhyayan karte hue hamen yah mahasoos hota he ki raajnneetik siddhanth kii anupurti hamen raajnneetik darshan ke adhyayan se kerani chahie anyathaa vah banjar or apraasangik prathit hote hai
 Political theories are sometimes seen as synonymous with political thought, but it is important to understand that they do not necessarily mean the same
 raajnneetik chintan ek samanyikrut muhaavara he, jisamen rajya tathaa rajya se sambandhit prashnon par kisi vyakti yaa vyaktiyon ke samooh yaa samudaay ke sabhi chintanon, siddhanton or mulyon kaa samavesh hota he
 When a person - whether he is a professor, journalist, writer, poet, novelist etc
 or of course he is a politician - expresses ideas that have a concern in our lives and the thoughts which are about the state and governance and the questions related to them, then he is really Is contemplating political
 uske vichaaron main siddhanth kaa samavesh ho bhi saktaa he or nahin bhi ho saktaa he
 There will be no theory contained in those ideas when there is no systematic and rational hypothesis presented to explain the historical and political composition related to political rule of state and governance etc
 is prakaar raajnneetik chintan hameshaa kisi vyakti yaa samooh kaa raajnneeti-vishyak saamaanya vichaar hota he, jabaki raajnneetik siddhanth apane-aap main purna or apane bal-boote khadi aisi vyakhya yaa vichaar athwa siddhanth hota he jisamen prashnon ke uttar dene, itihaas kii vyakhya karne or bhavishya kii sambhavit ghatnaon ke bare main purvanumaan lagane kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 Of course, this theory is always the creation of a single thinker
 barker ne kaha tha ki raajnneetik chintan kisi puure yug kaa antarvarti darshan hota he, lekin raajnneetik siddhanth kisi ek vyakti kaa chintan hota he
 Political science is a broad subject or field of study and political theory is a sub-field of it
 raajnneeti vigyaan main ye tamaam baaten shaamil hai: raajnneetik chintan, raajnneetik siddhanth, raajnneetik darshan, raajnneetik vichaardhaara, sansthagat yaa sanrachanagat dhaancha, tulanaatmak raajnneeti, lok prashasan, antarrashtriya kanoon or sanghathan aadi
 Some thinkers have emphasized the science side of political science
 unka kahana he ki jab raajnneeti vigyaan kaa adhyayan ek vigyaan ke rup main vaigyanik paddatiyon se kiya jaataa he tab raajnneetik siddhanth jis had tak raajnneetik darshan kaa hissaa he us had tak vah raajnneeti vigyaan nahin mana ja saktaa, kyonki raajnneeti vigyaan main to amurtt or antahprerana se udbhoot nishkarshon yaa chintanon ke liye koi sthaan nahin he lekin raajnneetik darshan thik inhen ayatharth paddatiyon par bharosa karke chalata he
 Political theory is neither pure thought nor pure philosophy nor pure science
 raajnneetik siddhanth main jin prashnon kaa mahatva rahaa he ve samay ke saath-saath badalte rahe hai
 Classical and early political theories were concerned with the quest for a morally flawless political system and focused on questions about the nature and purpose of the state, the basis for the use of political power, and the problem of political defiance
 aadhunik raashtra rajyon ke udai or aarthik sanrachana main hue parivartanon tathaa audyogic kranti ke falswaroop nai praathamikataayen saamne ain or dhyaan kaa centre vyaktvaad tathaa vyakti kii swatantraaa or samaaj evam rajya ke saath uskaa sambandh ban gaya
 Questions like rights, duties, liberty, equality and property became more important
 dhire-dhire ek avadharana ke saath dusro ke sambandh kii vyakhya jaise swatantraaa or samanta, nyaay or swatantraaa, yaa samanta or sampatti ke bich ke sambandh kii vyakhya : bhi mahatvapurn ho gai
 After World War II, a new type of empirical political theory emerged
 isamen manushya ke raajnneetik vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karne or uske aadhaar par saidhantik nishkarsh nikaalane kii koshish kii gai
 Scholars studying human behavior posed new questions for study
 ve bahudhaa vidha kii anya shakhaon se aise prashn udhaar lete the
 Some of these questions are as follows: vigat kuch dashakon se kai or bhi masale ubhare hai - jaise pahchaan, ling, paryaavarnavaad, paristhitiki, samudaay aadi
 At the same time, the value-based political theory has also been revived, in which the questions of freedom, equality and justice have been emphasized in a new way
 ham maanav gana saamaajik praaniyon ke rup main saath-saath samaaj main rahete hai, jisamen ham sansadhano, rojgaron or puraskaron main saajhedaari karte hai
 At the same time, we are also individuals, in which condition we need some basic human rights
 isliye mail-jol tathaa khushhaali ko adhiktam seemaa tak le jane ke khatir or vyaktigat aatm-siddhi ke liye anukool paristhitiyaan sulabh karaane ke nimitt rajya tathaa samaaj ke sanghathan kii prakriya mahatvapurn ho jaati he
 As a result, political theory becomes important for paving the way for the unity and integrity of human societies or the collective needs of society, as it tries to study problems and find solutions in that process
 raajnneetik siddhanth kii praasangikta rajya ke swaroop or prayojan ke prati, raajnneetik satta ke aadhaar or sarkaar ke sabase shreyaskar rup ke sambandh main or rajya tathaa vyakti ke buniyadi adhikaron ke sandarbh main un donon ke bich ke sambandhon ke bare main vibhinn drushtikonon kaa vikaas karne main nihit hoti he
 In addition, political theory also tries to establish moral standards and suggest alternative political management and behavior to test the moral quality of the political state
 sankshep main kahen to raajnneetik siddhanth kii praasangikta nimnlikhit baton main nihit haih It should also be remembered that at least in the present period the state is facing greater challenges of poverty, corruption, mass democracy and ethnic and racial tensions, environmental pollution etc
 inke alaava antarrashtriya vibhedon aadi kii samasya to he hi
 Political theory tries to study the present and future problems of the political life of society and suggest solutions to those problems
 david heldne kaha he ki raajnneetik siddhanth kaa kaary apni jatiltaaon ke kaaran bahut guru-gambhir he, kyonki vyavasthit adhyayan ke abhaav main is baat kaa khatra rahata he ki raajnneeti agyaan or swaarthee logon ke haathon main apni shakti kii bhukh mitaane kaa saadhan banakar na rah jaae
 Thus, if we have to systematically consider the nature and purpose of the state and the problems of governance, keeping in mind the social reality and ideals and political philosophy, then we have to adopt the path of theoretical study of the problem
 is prakaar raajnneetik siddhanth praasangik he
 At the same time, studying political theory on a personal level gives us information about our rights and duties and helps in understanding social realities and problems like poverty, violence, corruption etc
 raajnneetik siddhanth isliye bhi mahatvapurn hai ki vibhinn raajnneetik siddhanton ko aadhaar bana kar ‘aage badhate hue vah hamen samaaj ko badalane ke upaay or dishaaen suza saktaa he, taaki adarsh samaaj sthapit kiya ja sake
 The Marxist theory is an example of a theory that not only suggests direction but goes to the extent of advocating revolution to establish an egalitarian society
 yadi koi raajnneetik siddhanth sahi he to vah aam logon tak sampreshit kiya ja saktaa he or tab vah samaaj tathaa maanav jati ko pragati ke path par le jane vaali prabal shakti ban saktaa he

 All 180 ° longitudes east of this line are called longitude and all 180 ° longitudes in the west are called western longitudes
 Normally the eastern longitude is directed by e and western longitudes are directed by W
 There is a difference of 4 minutes between the two longitudes, that is, the Earth takes 4 minutes to rotate 1 ° longitude
 At 15 ° the Earth takes 1 hour

 kahani evam upanyaas donon vidhaon main samaan rup se rachanashil
 Generally accepted as a deeply researched story writer on topics, areas and sections cut off from the mainstream of society
 sanjeev kaa janm 6 july, 1947 i0 ko uttar pradesh ke sultanpur jile ke gaanv bongar kalaan main hua tha
 His higher education took place on science subjects
 bi0es-si0, e0ai0si0 kii degree lekar inhone san 1965 se 2003 i0 tak indian aayran and steel company, kulti main chemist incharge ke rup main kaam kiya

 Sanjeev is one of the leading signatures of the generational movement, often simultaneously with the populist movement after the sixty-first phase in Hindi literature
 ve lambey samay tak saahitiyik prachaar kendron se dur rahakar hi praayah ek sadhak kii tarah rachnarat rahe hai
 His first published story was 'aparna', which appeared in the small magazine 'parichay' to be published in the city next to him in 1962 AD
 badi patrika main prakashit honevaali pehali kahani thi 'kissa ek beemaa company kii agency kaa'
 This story was published in 'sarika' in April 1976
 kahani evam upanyaas donon vidhaon main unhone samaan rup se kriyasheeltaa evam dakshata kaa parichay diya he
 His 12 story collections and 10 novels have been published so far
 inke atirikt do bal upanyaas evam kuch anya rachanaayen bhi prakashit hai
 Many writers have written in both the story and novel genres, but equal activity and equal achievement in both have been rare
 kinhin kaa kahanikar rup pradhan bana rah jaataa he to kinhin kaa upanyaaskaar rup
 Acharya Nishantketu, while referring to many people in the context of equal accomplishment and fame in both these genres, has written in the context of Premchand and Jainendra Kumar that now critics have reached this conclusion and it is discussed that both these creators are story and novel Both possess equal importance and popular standing over creationism
 


 donon kathakaar donon vidhaon main samaswar hai
 Sanjeev seems to be the third link in this sequence
 sanjeev kaa adhikansh lekhan shodh kendrit he
 His creation process also reveals his understanding that composition is a process of struggle beyond the culmination of Bhavaweg
 sanjeev ke prati srunjay ke kathan se bhi yah baat puri tarah spasht ho jaati he - abhisht vishay par rachana kaa ek draft yah puraa kar legaa
 Then we will meet some friends someday
 yah apni likhat sunayega


 ham jamkar khinchaai karenge


 yah ek-ek nuks note karata rahegaa
 Will write again to some unsympathetic men - to test the narrative and communicability 


 then sometimes even four to five times
 yah apane upanyaason ko bhi kai baar ririt karata he
 Sanjeev himself believes that without research and research, i feel that i will not be able to write
 vastutah unka lekhan puri tarah patibaddh lekhan he
 'kala Kala Ke' means nothing to him
 'kala jivan ke liye' ko ve maanate hi nahin balki jite bhi hai
 In this context, he has given an example of Gogol
 unka kahana he ki gogol hameshaa hi mere liye maanak rahaa he, 'usne vah nahin likhaa jo vah likh saktaa tha, usne vah nahin likhaa jo janata chaahati thi balki usne vah likhaa jisase uske samaaj or desh kaa bhala hota
 'my goal is still the same
 lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki 'kala' ko ve mahatva nahin dete
 There is a unique combination of story and craft in his compositions
 ek nazar main tathyon kii bahulata unhen aalochakon kii drushti main samasya utpann karti si lagati he lekin jis kaushal se ve tathyon ke saath sthaniyata tathaa vaataavaran kaa bhi sarjanaatmak upyog karte hai, vah unhen vishisht banaata he
 Dr
 Pushppal Singh has a clear statement that Sanjeev holds a leading position among our few contemporary storytellers who compose the idea of composition with great skill, alchemy, whose reading gives the reader an ideological wealth
 It remains that he has read the story
 unke adhikansh upanyaas gahan shodh kii rachanaatmak parinti he
 In 'circus', the lifestyle and irony of the class living differently from the main life stream of society,' Be careful! Below is the tragedy of the coal-laborers in 'agni Hai', and in 'dhar' and especially in 'jungle Jahan Hai', the efforts of a creative counterpart portraying the oddities and irony of tribal life are clearly visible
 'sutaradhar' main loksahityakar bhikhaari thakur kaa jivan bahuayamita main chitrit hua he, to 2011 main prakashit upanyaas 'rah gayi dishaaen isi paar' fiction ke madhyam se rachana kii nayi jameen todta he
 Using his scientific studies and experiences fully creatively, Sanjeev has created the world in the form of depiction of evil irony amidst the infinite aspirations of human development
 is upanyaas ke sandarbh main da0 manager pandeya ne mana he ki vimarsh kii is bahuaiami prakriya main sanjeev har tarah ke anyaay, atyaachaar tathaa atichaar ke virdohi hai or agragami, nyaaysangat tathaa maanviya drushtikon ke pakshdhar
 Dr
 Ravi Bhushan assigns his stories to the real story of independent India, in order of a text-centric critique-analysis of his story-journey spanning a long writing period of nearly four decades; At the same time, it also clearly believes that the story of Sanjeev's stories is broad
 premachand or yashpal ko chhodkar itane bade katha-falak kaa anya koi kathakaar hindi main nahin he
 Operation jonaki saat samandar paar Overall specification of Pakhi focused on composition and personality jwalamukhi prithvi kii sataha par upasthit aisi daraar yaa mukh hota he jisase prithvi ke bheetar kaa garm lava, gas, raakh aadi baahar aate hai
 In fact, it is a fracture in the upper layer of the Earth through which the internal matter comes out
 jwalamukhi dwaara nicksruth in padaarthon ke jamaa ho jane se nirmit shankvakar sthalaroop ko jwalamukhi parvat kaha jaataa he
 Volcanoes are related to plate tectonics because it has been found that they are often found on the boundaries of plates because plate boundaries provide weak sites for fractures in the Earth's upper crust
 iske alaava kuch anya sthalon par bhi jwalamukhi paae jate hai jinaki utpatti mantal plum se maani jaati he or aise sthalon ko hotspot kii sangya di jaati he
 In geomorphology, a volcano is seen as an accidental event, and it is classified as a creative force in the forces that bring changes to the surface of the Earth because it creates many landforms
 vahiin, duusari ore paryaavaran bhugol inkaa adhyayan ek prakritik aapadaa ke rup main karata he kyonki isse paaritantr or jaan-maal kaa nuksaan hota he
 Volcano bhu-vaigyanikon main sakriyata ko lekar mataiky nahin he lekin agar koi jwalamukhi vartmaan main fat rahaa ho, yaa uske jald hi fatne kii ashanka ho, yaa phir usamen gas risne, dhuaan yaa lava ugalane, yaa bhucamp aane jaise sakriyata ke chihn hon to use sakriy mana jaataa he
 These are volcanoes that scientists expect will not explode
 inke bare main yah anumaan lagaaya jaataa he ki inke andar lava va megma khatm ho chukaa he or ab inamen ugalane kii garmi va saamagree bachi hi nahin he
 If there is no memory of any volcano ever having any event of explosive type of activity, then it is often considered dead
 vaigyanikon main mrit or supt jwalamukhiyon main antar bataa paanaa kathin he, lekin agar maanviya smriti main koi jwalamukhi kabhi bhi itihaas main bahut pehle fata ho to use supt hi mana jaataa he lekin mrit nahin
 There are many volcanoes that, after bursting, go through millions of years to create pressure for another eruption - they are considered dormant during that time

 In this ejaculation, a large amount of gas flows out with the lava, and the lava is cone-like and sometimes in the form of a dome or mound
 arthath ve jwalamukhi jinke vivar yaa mukh kaa vyas kuch 100 feet se adhik nahin hota he or iskaa aakaar gol yaa kareeb-kareeb gol hota he, tathaa jinase gas lava tathaa vikhandit padaarth adhik maatra main visphotak udbhedan ke saath aakaar main kaaphi oonchaai tak prakat hote hai, kendriya udgaar vaale jwalamukhi kehalaate hai
 They are highly destructive
 udgaar se bhayankar bhucamp aate hai
 These are again classified into several types depending on the intensity of the explosion: is prakaar ke udbhedan main lava ke saath gas kii maatra kam hoti he jisase lava daraaron main hokar dhraraatal par jamane lagata he
 Sometimes due to the accumulation of large amounts of lava, a thick layer is formed, which results in the formation of lava plains or lava plateaus
 jaise-1783 main iceland main ek 17 mile lambe daraar se hokar lava kaa udgaar hua he
 Which extended to 218 miles
 ise iceland kii jansankhya kaa 5waan bhaag nasht ho gaya
 Such eclipses occurred extensively in the Cretaceous era
 bharat main dakkan kaa pathari hissaa kriteshs yug ke ek daraari udbhedan dwaara nirmit he or is par besalt kii chattaanon ke apkshay se kaali regur mitti kaa nirmaan hua he
 Volcanic cones form when the dispersed material begins to accumulate around the volcanic cavity
 jab adhik jamaa ho jaataa he tab shanku kaaphi bada ho jaataa he tathaa parvat kaa rup dhaaran kar letaa he
 This is called volcanic mountain
 is parvat ke madhya main jo chhidr hota he use jwalamukhi chhidr, mukh athwa vivar kehete he
 This hole is connected to the bottom by a tube called a volcanic tube
 haal hi main ek shodh main yah paaya gaya he ki chote-chote jwalamukhi visphoton ke dwaara vartmaan jalwaayu parivartan kii gati dhimi ho sakati he

 Any substance that is made up of sugars, fats, water and / or protein and can be ingested by the living world is called food
 jeev na keval jivit rahane ke liye balki swasth or sakriy jivan bitaane ke liye bhojan karte hai
 Food contains many nutrients that develop the body, keep it healthy and provide strength
 bhojan main paae jane vaale aavashyak tatv hai - carbohydrate, protein, vasa or tel, vitamin or khanij
 In addition, food should have all the nutrients; That is, proteins to strengthen muscles and tissues, carbohydrates and fats to provide energy or strength, mineral salts for strong bones and blood development, and vitamins for healthy life and physical development
 sharir main vibhinn poshak tatwon- carbohydrate, protein, vasa, vitamin or khanij kii aavashyaktaa manushya kii aayu, ling, shaareerik shram or sharir kii dasha par nirbhar karti he
 a laborer doing manual labor needs more power-providing food than a person working in an office
 garbhvatee auraton or stanpan karne vaale bacchon kii maataaon ko shaareerik parivartanon ke kaaran adhik protein or khanijon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Therefore, it is important that every person should include all the necessary nutrients in their food according to their age, sex, work condition etc
 manushya kii in aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne vaale bhojan ko santulit bhojan kehete hai
 Balanced food can be prepared by mixing the following food items with prudence
 carbohydrate tathaa vasa yukt bhojan ko shaktidaayak bhojan kehete hai
 Pulses, condoms, dry fruits, sugar, oil and fats fall into this category
 adhik protein vaala bhojan sharir nirmaan karne vaala bhojan kehalaata he
 Milk, ghee, pulses, oilseeds, gurri and low fat oilseed products of the native cow of Indian breed fall into this category
 jis bhojan main protein, vitamin or khanij adhik paye jate hai use sangrakshan dene vaala bhojan kehete hai
 Milk and milk products, eggs, kaleji, green leafy vegetables and fruits fall into this category
 bharat main adhikansh log adhik anaaj khate hai or unke bhojan main duusare shaktiwarddhak tatwon kii kami hoti he
 Broadly, it can be improved by making changes in the food, that is, wherever there is an excess of food in the food, the quantity of food should be reduced and instead the elements which meet the body's protein, vitamins and minerals in the food should be increased
 
 jahaan kahin is prakaar ke khaadya padaarth uplabdh hon unase or vigyaan evam praudyogiki ke prayog se, parirakshit bhojan kii sahaayta se, paushtik aahaar main sudhaar laayaa ja saktaa he
 Nutritional losses during cooking can be prevented by using improved methods of preparing food
 bhojan ko adhik ubaalane yaa talane se bahut se poshak tatv nasht ho jate hai
 Therefore, care should be taken to ensure that the food is cooked properly

 66px 66px charyaapad puthi bankimachandra chattopadhyaay, rabindranath thakur, kaaji nazarul islam begum rokeya, mir mashaararaf hosen, sharatchandra chattopadhyaay The literature of Bengali language can be broadly divided into three parts - 1
 pracheen, 2
 Middle Carpet and 3
 aadhunik-
 Early literature is more important from the point of view of Bengal's life and its merits and demerits
 chandidas, krittivas, maladhar, pipalai, lochanda, gyaandas, kavikankan, mukundaram, krishnadas, kashiram das, bharatchandaray, gunakar aadi kavi isi kaal main hue hai
 Like other scholars of India, the scholars of Bengal used to give special importance to the works of Sanskrit
 unki drushti main vahi "amar bharti" kaa pad sushobhit kar sakati thi
 He considered colloquial language to be variable and temporary
 kintu jansadharan to apane vichaaron or bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye usee bhashaa ko pasand kar sakate the jo unke hriday ke adhik nikat ho
 They could teach and teach in the same language

 It can be called Nagar or Shaurseni Apabhransh, which was largely the language of western Uttar Pradesh, eastern Punjab and Rajasthan
 saamaanya janata ke liye in donon bhashaaon main thodaa sa sahitya vidyaman tha
 Songs of love and devotion, proverbs and folklore were found in the mother tongue
 buddha tathaa hindu dharm ke upadeshak janata main prachaar karne ke liye jo rachanaayen taiyaar karte the ve praaia: puraani banglaa tathaa nagar apbhransh, donon main hoti thim
 47 Chariyapads are of special importance in the available compositions of the ancient Bengali
 ye praaia: aath panktiyon ke rahasyamay geet hai jinka sambandh mahayan bauddhadharm tathaa nathpanth, donon se sambhddha gupt sampradaay se he
 Their common external meaning is often understood in this way and the deeper meaning can also be understood with the help of Sanskrit commentary, which was received with this collection as well as Sri Harprasad Shastri
 in geeton yaa padyon main "kavita" naam kii cheez to nahin he kintu jivan kii ekaadh jhalak avashya kisi kisi main dekh padati he
 Some other poetic compositions similar to this were also received from Nepal by Dr
 Prabodhchandra Bagchi and Rahul Sankrityayan etc
 " 12veen shatabdi ke ant tak puraatan banglaa main yathesht sahitya taiyaar ho chukaa tha jisase us samay ke ek bengali kavi ne yah garvokti kii thi "log jaisaa ganga main snaan karne se pavitra ho jate hai, vaise hi ve 'bengal vaani' main snaat hokar pavitra ho sakate hai
 "but unfortunately, apart from the said 47 Chariyapadas and few songs or verses, very few compositions of that period are available today
 gitgovind ke rachayita jayadev bengal ke hindu raja lakshmana sen ke shasankaal main vidyaman the
 There are 24 songs in this beautiful poem describing the love of Radha and Krishna, but not everyone is perfect
 sanskrit main praaia: tukant nahin miltaa
 This is the specialty of Apabhransh or the budding indo-aryan languages
 kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki in padon kii rachana mulat: puraani banglaa main yaa apbhransh main kii gai thi or phir unamem thodaa parivartan kar sanskrit ke anuroop bana diya gaya
 In this way Jayadeva can be considered a famous poet of ancient Bengal, who in addition to Sanskrit, probably composed in Old Bengali too
 jo ho, bengal ke kitne hi pargami kaviyon ko unase prerana mili, isamen andeh nahin
 There is no evidence that there has been a big poem written in the old Bengali
 us samay aisi rachanaayen bengal main bhi praaia: apbhransh main hi hoti thim
 However, when the famous poet Vidyapati of Mithila composed the famous historical poem, he also practiced it not in his mother tongue Maithili, but in Apabhramsa, although in between, the words Maithil have also been used

 It was during this period that the Bengali-speaking Muslim population emerged and grew gradually
 turk akramanakariyon main se bahuton ne bengal kii striyon se hi vivaah kar liya or dhire-dhire "yahan kii bhashaa, rahan sahan aadi ko" apana liya
 They forgot Turkish and Arabic remained the language of religion only
 bengal main hindu jameendaaron or saamanton kii hi vyavastha abhi prachlit thi, falat: muslim vichaaron or paddatiyon kaa janajivan par abhi drushtigochar hone yogya vishesh prabhaav nahin padane paaya tha
 When peace was established in Bengal after some time, when the study of Sanskrit, preaching etc
 was facilitated, then education and literature as if the primary renaissance started

 He was the first popular poet to present the Sanskrit Ramayana in Bengali, who portrayed Rama as Valmiki, not as a pure human and heroic man, but as a compassionate avatar of God, towards whom the heart of the simple devotional people is easily attracted could
 isi tarah krishnagtha kaa varnan usee shatabdi main maladhar basu ne kiya
 It is based on the Bhagavata Purana

 This story was probably prevalent before the arrival of Muslims, but the first story based on it was composed in Bengali in the 15th century
 inamen se ek ke rachayita vijaygupt or duusari ke vipradaas pipalai maane jate hai
 Chandidas, a famous poet of the pre-secondary Bengali, is considered
 inke naam se koi 1200 pad yaa kavitaayen prachlit hai
 There is so much difference in their language, style etc
 that they do not seem to be composed by the same person
 aisa prathit hota he ki madhyamik banglaa main is naam ke kam se kam teen kavi hue
 The first Chandidas were the pioneers of Srikrishnakirtan who existed before Chaitanya, around 1400 AD

 He composed most of the songs of Radha Krishna's love interest that earned Chandidas such a popularity
 tisare chandidas deen chandidas hue jo sangrah ke teen chauthai bhaag ke rachayita prathit hote hai
 There is no doubt that the first two Chandidas were the mainstays of Chandidas's fame
