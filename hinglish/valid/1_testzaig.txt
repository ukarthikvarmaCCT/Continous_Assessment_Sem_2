 Lindelof and Cuse said that deciding the 2010 series finale date was "extremely liberating" and helped rediscover the center of the series
 lindelopha ne kaha, "ham ab or nahin roak rahe hai
 "the makers plan to end long-running secrets, including the nature of the smoking monster, the four-thumbed tower, the identity and religion of Adam and Eve from the Season 1 episode of House of the Rising Sun" The reason for continuing even after the abolition of topical

 Along with the development of his character, the episodes of Lost also contain several mysterious elements that have been shown to be related to science fiction or supernatural events
 shrinkhalaa ke rachanaakaar in tatwon ko shrinkhalaa kii puranic kathaon ko rachane ke liye prayog karte he or yah prashansako kii atakalon kaa aadhaar banate he
 Among the mythological elements of this program is a "monster" that roams the island; a mysterious faction known as Survivor "others", an organization called the Religion Initiative, which maintains many research bases on the island, a number sequence that frequently appears in characters' pasts, present and future, and personal relationships or The synchronization between characters of which they are often unaware
 shrinkhalaa multah ek jatil or rahasyamayi kahani he jo kai ansulajhe sawaalon ke aas paas gumti he
 Encouraged by Lost's writers and artists, who often interact with their fans online, audiences and TV critics have created extensive theories in an attempt to unravel the mysteries
 siddhanton main mukhya rup se dweep kaa swaroop, 'rakshas'or "adars" kaa mul, ankon kaa matlab or durghatana kaa hona va kuch yatriyon ke bachane kaa kaaran shaamil he
 Some of the public fanfare has been discussed and rejected by the creators of the public theory program, with the most common being that the survivor of Oceanic Flight 815 is dead or in hell
 yah je je abramas dwaara vishesh rup se nakaar diya gaya tha
 In addition, Lindelof has ruled out speculation that the spacecraft or the inhabitants of another planet affect the events of the island or whether everything is happening in a person's imagination
 carlton kus ne is siddhant ko bhi kaarij kar diya jiske anusaar yah dweep par ek reality tivi kaarykram he or kalakaar bekhbar sangi hai
 And Lindelof has also refuted the theory that the 'monster' is a robot as in Michael Crickton's novel Pre
 ' tathaapi, yah dhyaan dena zaruri he ki pehle ke asweekrut siddhant, vishesh rup se samaykaal se sambandhit, asweekaar hone se shrinkhalaa main sammilit hone main badal gaye isi prakaar ho saktaa he ki anya asweekrut siddhant bhi naatak main sammilit ho jaye
 Lost has several recurring elements and motifs that usually have no direct impact on the story, but present the literary and philosophical aspect of the event

 The rifle faced a lot of problems in the initial stages of production, the first models it encountered were the receivers of the stamped metal sheet, its guides and ejector trail were also difficult to weld, due to which it got bigger The scale had to be rejected but instead of stopping production, a heavy mechanical receiver was put in it
 It was a costly solution but after doing it the product The speed of the day was increased, then no new mechanical revavers were being installed, only the receivers of the earlier Mosin Nagat rifles were being used, due to this problem, these rifles could not be distributed in mass in the Soviet Army until 1956
 , And during this time only SKS Rifle was given to the army, Once the production problem was resolved, a new model was started to be given to the AKM army
this new model was equipped with a stamped sheet metal receiver
 It also had a hammer marker so that a limited number of rounds could be run while the automatic shot was fired, and the weapon would not suffer any damage, it is also called round redioser

 For example, Ashwattha lore in relation to the nature of the world, Avyayamusha lore in the context of eternal Ajna Brahma, Aksha Purushu vidha in the matter of Para Prakriti or Jiva, and Ksharapurushu Vidya concerning Apara Prakriti or material world
 is prakaar vedon ke brahmavaad or upanishdon ke aadhyatm, in donon kii vishisht saamagree gita main sannivisht he
 In the words of Pushpika it is called theology
 gita main 'brahmavidya' kaa aashay nivrittiparak gyanmarg se he
 It is called Sankhyamat with which the Nivitvarigi Vibhagya is associated
 lekin gita upanishdon ke mode se aage badhkar us yug kii dein he, jab ek nayaa darshan janm le rahaa tha jo grihasthon ke pravriti dharm ko nivritti maarg ke samakaksh or utana hi faldaayak maanata tha
 The same signifies the word 'yogashastra' in the Pushpika of the Gita
 yahan ‘yogashastre’ kaa abhipraay ni:andeh karmyog se hi he
 Two definitions of yoga are found in the Gita
 ek nivritti maarg kii drushti se jisamen ‘samatvam yoga uchyate’ kaha gaya he arthath gunon ke vaishamy main samyabhav rakhana hi yoga he
 This is the position of Sankhya
 yoga kii duusari paribhaasha he ‘yoga: karmsu kaushalam’ arthath karmon main lage rahane par bhi aise upaay se karm karnaa ki vah bandhan kaa kaaran na ho or karm karanevaala usee asang yaa nirlep sthiti main apane ko rakh sake jo gyanamargiyon ko milti he
 The name of this device is Buddhayog and this is the essence of the Yoga of the Gita
 gita ke duusare adhyay main jo ‘tasya pragnapratishthita’ kii dhun pai jaati he, uskaa abhipraay nirlep karm kii kshamtavali buddhi se hi he
 This was not a situation of attaining renunciation by the renunciation of karma, but a plan to elevate the pre-existing mind to a state of disinterest while performing karma
 yahi gita kaa karmyog he
 Just as in many places in the Mahabharata, so is the interpretation and appreciation of the Sankhya path of Sankhya and the path of Karma
 ek kii ninda or duusare kii prashansa gita kaa abhimath nahin, donon maarg do prakaar kii ru chi rakhanevaale manushyon ke liye hitkar ho sakate hai or hai
 Probably no other book of the world renders the scripture of Karma with this beauty, this subtlety and objectivity
 is drushti se gita adbhut maanviya shaastra he
 Its vision is not one-sided, but all-round
 gita main darshan kaa pratipaadan karte hue bhi jo sahitya kaa anand he vah isaki atirikt visheshta he
 The description of the philosophy through cultured poetry is the personal grief of the Gita, which does not remain without enchanting any heart
 isiilie iskaa naam bhagavadgita padaa, bhagavan kaa gaaya hua gyaan
 The background of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita is the war of Mahabharata
 jis prakaar ek saamaanya manushya apane jivan kii samasyaon main ulajhakar kinkartavyavimudh ho jaataa he or uske pashchaat jivan ke samarangan se palaayan karne kaa man bana letaa he usee prakaar arjuna jo mahabharat kaa mahanayake he apane saamne aane vaali samasyaon se bhaybheet hokar jivan or kshatriya dharm se niraash ho gaya he, arjuna kii tarah hi ham sabhi kabhi-kabhi anishchay kii sthiti main yaa to hataash ho jate hai or yaa phir apni samasyaon se udign hokar kartavya vimukh ho jate hai
 The sages of India, after deep thought, imbibed the knowledge they gave to the Vedas
 inhen vedon kaa antim bhaag upanishad kehalaata he
 The characteristic of human life is the intellectual power acquired by human beings, and the knowledge contained in the Upanishads is not only the highest state of human intelligence but also gives a glimpse of what man can experience beyond the limits of intellect
 gita ke 18 adhyyon main varnit vishyon kii bhi kramprapt sangati he
 The name of the first chapter is Arjunvishad Yoga
 vah gita ke upadesh kaa vilakshan naatakeey rangamanch prastut karata he jisamen shrota or vaktaa donon hi kutuhal shanti ke liye nahin varan jivan kii pragadh samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye pravrutt hote hai
 Shaurya and patience, courage and strength made Arjuna's personality with the impressive amount of these four qualities and above all these four qualities were one and forgiveness, the other is wisdom
 balpradhan kshatradharm se praapt honevaali sthiti main pahunchakar sahasaa arjuna ke chitt par ek duusare hi prakaar ke manobhaav kaa akraman hua, carpanya kaa
 a strange kind of compassion filled his mind and his faint nature vanished
 jis kartavya ke liye vah katibaddh hua tha usase vah vimukh ho gaya
 On looking from above, his arguments in favor of this situation seem to be religious, but he himself has called it Karpanya Dosh and it is believed that due to this cuteness of mind, his natal nature was hurt or destroyed
 vah nirnay nahin kar paa rahaa tha ki yuddh kare athwa vairaygy le le
 What to do, what not to do, was not understood
 is manobhaav kii charam sthiti main pahunchakar usne dhanushbaan ek ore daal diya
 Krishna saw Arjuna's condition that Arjuna's body was fine but before the start of the war, the morale of that wonderful Kshatriya was broken
 bina man ke yah sharir khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Therefore, a guru duty came in front of Krishna
 at: tark se, buddhi se, gyaan se, karm kii charchaa se, vishwa ke swabhaav se, usamen jivan kii sthiti se, donon ke niamak avyay purush ke parichay se or us sarvopari param sattavan brahm ke saakshaat darshan se arjuna ke man kaa uddhaar karnaa, yahi unka lakshya hua
 The subject of this discussion is Gita
 pehle adhyay main saamaanya reeti se bhoomika rup main arjuna ne bhagwaan se apni sthiti kah di
 The second chapter is named Sankhyayoga
 isamen jivan kii do pracheen sanmanit paramparaon kaa tarkon dwaara varnan aayaa he
 Seeing Arjuna weeping in that sorrowful condition, Krishna has brought to his attention that this type of claviness and petty infirmity of heart is not suitable for a hero like Arjun
 krishna ne arjuna kii ab tak di hui sab yuktiyon ko pragnawad kaa jhootha rup kaha
 His trick is that Pragyadarshana essentially accepts all the events and situations of the world from time, karma and nature
 jeena or maranaa, janm lenaa or badhanaa, vishyon kaa aana or janaa
 Experiences of happiness and sorrow, these occur only in the world, this was also called the ancient Acharya synonymism
 kaal kii chakragati in sab sthitiyon ko laati he or le jaati he
 After knowing this nature of life, there is no mourning again
 yahi bhagwaan kaa vyangy he ki pragna ke drushtikon ko maanate hue bhi arjuna is prakaar ke moh main kyon pad gaya he
 An essential part of the above view was the continuity of life and the impermanence of the body
 nity jeev ke liye shok karnaa utana hi vyarth he jitna anitya sharir ko bachaane kii chintaa
 Both of these are unavoidable
 janm or mrityu baari baari se hote hi hai, aisa samajhakar shok karnaa uchit nahin he
 Then another view is of apostasy
 janm se hi prakruti ne sabake liye ek dharm niyat kar diya he
 In it comes the path of life, the periphery of desires, the power of karma
 isse nikal kar nahin bhaaga ja saktaa
 Even if someone runs away, nature again pulls him
 is prakaar kaal kaa parivartan yaa pariman, jeev kii nityata or apana swadharm yaa swabhaav jin yuktiyon se bhagavan, ne arjuna ko samajhaayaa he use unhone sankhya kii buddhi kaha he
 Further, even after Arjuna did not question, he also described the wisdom of the yogamarga
 yah buddhi karm yaa pravriti maarg ke aagrah kii buddhi he isamen karm karte hue karm ke fal kii aasakti se apane ko bachaana aavashyak he
 The biggest fear for the Karmayogi is that he gets trapped in the party of desire for fruit; He should avoid it
 arjuna ko andeh hua ki kya is prakaar kii buddhi praapt karnaa sambhav he
 What would be the situation of a person if he did deeds and no fruit, it was a practical doubt
 usne poocha ki is prakaar kaa drudh pragnawala vyakti jivan kaa vyavhaar kaise karata he? aana, janaa, khaanaa, pinaa, karm karnaa, unamem lipt hokar bhi nirlep kaise rahaa ja saktaa he? krishna ne kitne hi prakaar ke bahya indriyon kii apeksha man ke sanyam kii vyakhya kii he
 Through work, anger, fear, raga, malice, the mild mind is disturbed and the senses are not in control
 indriyajay hi sabase badi aatmajay he
 Even if someone gives up subjects from outside, the inner mind does not agree
 vishyon kaa swaad jab man se jaataa he, tabhi man prafullit, shant or sukhi hota he
 Rivers come in the sea, but he does not give up his dignity
 aise hi sansar main rahete hue, uske vyavhaaron ko sweekaarte hue, anek kaamanaayon kaa pravesh man main hota rahata he
 But those who do not lose their dignity only get peace
 ise pracheen aadhyatm paribhaasha main gita main brahmisthiti kaha he
 Thus, listening to the answer of Sankhya's explanation, in the third chapter called Karmayoga, Arjuna asked a clear question to get deeper into the subject that Sankhya and Yoga do you think well in both these passages and why not say that i am in both of them Whom should i adopt? To this, Krishna replied with the same clearness that there are two loyalties or lifespans in the world - jnana yoga for the Samkhists and karmayoga for the Karmargamis
 yahan koi vyakti karm chhod hi nahin saktaa
 Nature compels a person to perform actions with the effect of all three qualities
 karm se bachnewaalon ke prati ek badi shankaa he, vah yah ki ve upar se to karm chhod baithte hai par man hi man usamen duube rahete hai
 This situation is unbearable and Krishna has called it falsehood in the Gita
 man main karmedriyon ko rokkar karm karnaa hi saral maanviya maarg he
 Krishna even said as a challenge that without karma one cannot get food to eat
 phir krishna ne karm ke vidhaan ko chakra ke rup main upasthit kiya
 Not only are the creations of different persons threaded together on the social plane, but the relationship between man on earth and God of heaven is also dependent on the action cycle
 pratyaksh he ki yahan manushya karm karte hai, krishi karte hai or daivi shaktiyaan vrishti kaa jal bhejti hai
 Both grain and purgenes arise from karma
 ek main maanviya karm, duusare main daivi karm
 Then in favor of Karma, the idea of lok Sangraha has been given, that is, without Karma, the structure of society cannot stand
 jo lok ke netaa hai, janak jaise gyani hai, ve bhi karm main pravriti rakhte hai
 Krishna himself gave his own illustration and said that i am the form of Narayana, there is no work left for me
 phir bhi tandrarahit hokar karm karata hoon or anya log mere maarg par chalate hai
 The difference is that those who are foolish do the work by indulging but the knowledgeable does the work with disrespect
 gita main yaheen ek sabhipraay shabd buddhibhed he
 That is, it is not proper to uproot the people of ordinary understanding who are engaged in karma, because they cannot become knowledgeable, and if their karma is missed, then they will go astray on both sides
 chauthe adhyay main, jiskaa naam gyaan-karm-sanyas-yoga he, yah bataaya gaya he ki gyaan praapt karke karm karte hue bhi karmsanyas kaa fal kis upaay se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In this true Karmayoga is considered to occur in the tradition of the Chakravarti kings
 mandhata, sudarshan aadi anek chakravarti raajaaon ke drushtaant die gaye hai
 This is the famous assurance of the Gita that when there is defamation of religion, then there is an incarnation of God among humans, that is, the power of God is especially tangible
 yaheen par ek vaakya vishesh dhyaan dene yogya he- kshipran hi manushe loke siddhirbhavatee karmaja 
 'karma se siddhi' - There is no more effective sutra in Gitadarshan
 kintu gitatv is sutara main itnaa sudhaar or karata he ki vah karm asang bhav se arthath falasakti se bachakar karnaa chahie
 In the fifth chapter, again she has gone somewhere in the form of tips and perseverance
 isamen karm ke saath jo man kaa sambandh he, uske sanskaar par yaa use vishuddh karne par vishesh dhyaan dilaayaa gaya he
 It has also been said that there is no difference between Sankhya and Yoga by reaching a high level
 kisi ek maarg par thik prakaar se chale to samaan fal praapt hota he
 By surrendering all the deeds of life, a person reaches the pole point of absolute peace and does not indulge in karmic water like a lotus blooming in water
 chatha adhyay aatmasanyam yoga he jiskaa vishay naam se hi prakat he
 The number of subjects is the restraint of the most senses - this is the squeeze of karma and knowledge
 sukh main or dukh main man kii samaan sthiti, ise hi yoga kehete hai
 The noun of the seventh chapter is Jnana Vigyan Yog
 ye pracheen bhartiya darshan kii do paribhaashaayen hai
 Among them, the word science was very important from the Vedic point of view
 sristi ke nanaatv kaa gyaan vigyaan he or nanaatv se ekatv kii ore pragati gyaan he
 Both these views are suitable for humans
 is prasang main vigyaan kii drushti se aparaa or para prakruti ke in do roopon kii jo sunishchit vyakhya yahan gita ne di he, vah avashya dhyaan dene yogya he
 Apara Prakriti has eight elements, Panchabhuta, Mind, Wisdom and Ego
 jis and se maanav kaa janm hota he
 These eight live in it
 kintu yah praakrit sarg he arthath yah jad he
 In this, the consciousness that comes from contact with the efforts of God is called Para Prakriti; He is a living being
 aath tatwon ke saath milakar jivan navaan tatv ho jaataa he
 In this chapter, many forms of God are mentioned, whose further expansion comes in the tenth chapter called Vibhutiog
 yaheen vishesh bhagwati drushti kaa bhi ullekh he jiskaa sutara-vasudev: sarvamiti, sab vasu yaa shariron main ek hi devtatv he, usee kii sangya vishnu he
 But in the people according to their own idi, the same deity is worshiped in many names and forms
 ve sab thik hai
 But it is good that a wise person recognizes the universe which is the highest peak of spiritual science
 aathven adhyay kii sangya akshar brahmyog he
 Akshar Vidya expanded in Upanishads
 gita main us aksharavidya kaa saar kah diya gaya he-akshar brahm paraman, arthath parabrahm kii sangya akshar he
 Spirituality is the name of the combined composition of man, that is, organism and body
 jeevasanyukt bhautik deh kii sangya kshar he or keval shaktitatv kii sangya aadhidaivak he
 The way these three powers work together in the body, the God, and the ghost are called Adhigyas
 gitakar ne do shlokon main in chah paribhaashaon kaa swaroop band diya he
 In the words of Gita, ॐ monosyllable is Brahman
 nawein adhyay ko raajaguhyayog kaha gaya he, arthath yah aadhyatm vidya vidyaraji he or yah guhya gyaan sabamein shreshth he
 The word Raja also had a meaning in mind
 atev man kii divya shaktimayon ko kis prakaar brahmamay banaaya jaay, isaki yukti hi rajvidya he
 In this area, the representation of Brahmanism is predominant, from which the creation of the expressed world is repeated
 veda kaa samast karmkand yajna, amrit, or mrityu, sant or asant, or jitne bhi devi devtaa he, sabakaa paryavsaan brahm main he
 The variety of Devpuja which is popular in the world is also right in its place, this vision of coordination was acceptable to the Bhagwat Acharyas, in fact it was their great power
 isi drushtikon kaa vichaar yaa vyakhya dasven adhyay main pai jaati he
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 iskaa saar yah he ki lok main jitne devtaa hai, sab ek hi bhagwaan, kii vibhutiyaan hai, manushya ke samast gun or avagun bhagwaan kii shakti ke hi rup hai
 Wisdom may be able to explain these liberated gods, but they are there in the world
 koi pipal ko pooj rahaa he
 Some mountain, river or sea, some fish and turtles
 yon kitne devtaa hai, iskaa koi ant nahin
 This abundance of deities is found everywhere in the history of the world
 bhagwaton ne inaki satta ko sweekaarte hue sabko vishnu kaa rup maanakar samanvay kii ek nai drushti pradaan kii
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 jo satv jeev balayukt athwa chamatkarayukt he, vah sab bhagwaan kaa rup he
 Considering this, the mind gets into an uncontrolled state
 11wein adhyay kaa naam vishvaroopadarshan yoga he
 In this, Arjuna saw the world form of God
 viraat rup kaa arth he maanviya dharaatal or paridhi ke upar jo anant vishwa kaa pranavant rachanavidhan he, uskaa saakshaat darshan
 The quadrilateral form of Vishnu is benign on the human plane
 jab arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa viraat rup dekha to uske mastak kaa visphoton hone laga
 'directo na jaane na labhe f shame' These same sentences of panic came out of his mouth and he prayed that the natural condition which God has placed for man is sufficient
 13wein adhyay main ek sidhaa vishay kshetra or kshetrajna kaa vichaar he
 This is the body area, the person who knows it is a field expert
 14wein adhyay kaa naam gunatray vibhaag yoga he
 This subject is a squeeze of all the Vedic, philosophical and mythological metaphysics — there are many interpretations of the three gunas — trios called sattva, raja, tam
 gunon kii samyavastha kaa naam pradhan yaa prakruti he
 a pathless creation is born from the contrast of qualities
 akelaa satv shant swabhaav se nirmal prakaash kii tarah sthir rahata he or akelaa tam bhi jadvat nishcesht rahata he
 But Rajoguna, who is in the middle of the two, drags them to the ground of Chesta
 gati tatv kaa naam hi rajas he
 The name of the 15th chapter is Purushottamayoga
 isamen vishwa kaa ashwatth ke rup main varnan kiya gaya he
 This ashwattha-like world is a great expansion
 desh or kaal main iskaa koi ant nahin he
 But the root or center of it, which is called the upward, is Brahm
 On the one hand, the ultimate glory, which gives rise to the cosmopolitan Ashwattha, is manifested in the form of the Sun and the Moon, on the other hand, it is in a Chaitanya center or Zoological
 Is in the body
 jaisaa gita main spasht kaha he-ahan vaishwanaro bhutva praninaan dehamashrith: 
 There is no more mystery than globalism or pranamayi consciousness
 nar yaa purush teen hai-kshar, akshar or avyay
 The name of the Panchabhutas is Kshar, the name of Prana is Akshar and the noun of Manastattva or Consciousness is indestructible
 inhen teen naron kii ekatra sthiti se maanvi chetana kaa janm hota he use hi rishiyon ne vaishwanar agni kaha he
 In the 16th chapter, the department of Dewasur property is described
 aarambh se hi rigdev main sristi kii kalpana daivi or asuri shaktiyon ke rup main kii gai he
 It is a fantasy of two forms of creation, one good and the other bad
 ek prakaash main, doosraa andhkaar main
 One nectar, the other mortal
 ek satya, doosraa anrut
 The noun of the 17th chapter is Shraddhatraya Vigyan Yoga
 iskaa sambandh sat, raj or tam, in teen gunon se hi he, arthath jisamen jis gun kaa pradurbhaav hota he, uski shraddha yaa jivan kii nishtha waisi hi ban jaati he
 Yagya, penance, charity, deeds are all conducted with three types of devotion
 yahan tak ki aahaar bhi teen prakaar kaa he
 The Gita has explained their differences and characteristics here
 18wein adhyay kii sangya mokshasanyas yoga he
 It contains a summary and epilogue of all the teachings of the Gita
 yahan pun: balpurvak maanav jivan ke liye teen gunon kaa mahatv kaha gaya he
 There is no one among the human beings of the earth and among the gods of heaven who is saved from these three qualities of nature
 manushya ko bahut dekh bhalkar chalanaa aavashyak he jisase vah apni buddhi or vritti ko buraai se bachaa sake or kya kaary he, kya acarya he, isko pahchaan sake
 The intellect which properly recognizes religion and unrighteousness, bondage and salvation, instinct and retirement, is the true wisdom and is the true achievement of man
 is prakaar bhagwaan ne jivan ke liye vyaavhaarik maarg kaa upadesh dekar ant main yah kaha he ki manushya ko chahie ki sansar ke sab vyavhaaron kaa sachai se paalan karte hue, jo akhand chaitanya tatv he, jise ishwar kehete hai, jo prayek praani ke hriddesh yaa centre main virajman he, usamen vishwaas rakhe, uskaa anubhav kare
 He is the entity's power, he is consciousness and he is the source of supreme bliss
 sanskrit sahitya kii parampara main un granthon ko bhashya, kehete hai jo duusare granthon ke arth kii vrihad vyakhya yaa tikaa prastut karte hai
 The Bhagavad Gita is also one of the three texts that had to clarify their perspective in order to establish any new philosophy or any new form of philosophy in the Indian philosophical tradition
 gita par anek achaaryon evam vidwaanon ne tikaayen kii hai
 Their short list according to sects is as follows: inke atirikt maharashtra sant gyandev yaa gyaneshwarkrut bhavarthadipika naam kii tikaa prasiddh he jo gita ke gyaan ko bhavatmak kavyastylee main prakat karti he
 In the present era, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilakkrit Geetarasya Tika, which was first introduced in 1915 with very detailed role and deliberation
 main puna se prakashit hui thi, gita sahitya main mahatvapurn sthaan rakhti he
 He has made such a diversion in bringing the original meaning of Gita to scholars, which was not possible till today after Shankaracharya
 vastut: shankaracharya kaa bhashya gita kaa mukhya arth gyanaprak karata he jabaki tilak ne gita ko karm kaa pratipadak shastr siddh kiya he
 Among all the languages available on the Bhagavad Gita, the element of Shri Jayadayal Goindka is the most popular and popular

 In the serial Mahabharata, aired on Doordarshan, Bhagavad Gita was a special attraction, while in the serial Sri Krishna, the Bhagwad Gita was highly researched and shown as a series of episodes
 isaki ek vishesh baat yah rahi ki gita se sambandhit saamaanya manushya ke sandehon ko arjuna ke prashnon ke madhyam se uttarit karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Apart from this, the serial gita-rahasya by Nitish Bhardwaj was completely focused on different dimensions of Gita itself
 internet par bhi aaj anekanek websiten is vishay par bahumadhyamon ke dwaara vishad jaankaree detii hai
 Shrimad Bhagwadgita is currently attracting attention of people not only in India but also abroad with her philosophical approach towards life more than religion
 nishkaam karm kaa gita kaa sandesh prabandhan guruon ko bhi lubhaa rahaa he
 It is included in the most famous books of all religions of the world

 The teachings of the Gita are very ancient yoga
 shri bhagavan kehete hai ise maine sabase pehle surya se kaha tha
 The Sun is the symbol of knowledge, so the words of Shri God mean that even before the creation of the earth, i have given this knowledge to the devotees who have done many forms of research
 yah ishwariya vaani he jisamen sampoorn jivan kaa saar he evam aadhaar he
 Who am I? What is this body? Is my beginning and end with this body? Will i exist after my body renunciation? Where and in what form will this existence exist? What is the reason for me coming into the world? What will happen after leaving my body, where will i go? These things keep revolving in the heart of any curious person
 ham sadaa in baton ke bare main sochate hai or apane ko, apane swaroop ko nahin jaan pate
 In the Gita Shastra, the answers to all these questions have been readily given by Shri Bhagwan through religious dialogue
 is deh ko jisamen 36 tatv jeevatma kii upasthiti ke kaaran judakar kaary karte hai, kshetra kaha he or jeevatma is kshetra main nivas karata he, vahi is deh kaa swami he parantu ek teesraa purush bhi he, jab vah prakat hota he; adhidaiv arthath 36 tatwon vaale is deh ko or jeevatma kaa naash kar daalata he
 This perfect man is the ultimate state and ultimate truth
 yahi nahin, deh main sthit or deh tyagkar jate hue jeevatma kii gati kaa yatharth vaigyanik env tarksangat varnan gita shaastra main hua he
 The soul is eternal and the soul has attained the spirit of life
 sharir ke mar jane par jeevatma apane karmanusaar vibhinn yoniyon main vicharan karata he
 The Gita begins with the word Dharma and at the end of the eighteenth chapter of the Gita it is called Dharma Samvad
 dharm kaa arth he dhaaran karne vaala athwa jise dhaaran kiya gaya he
 The one who holds is called the soul and the one who holds it is nature
 aatma is sansar kaa beej arthath pita he or prakruti garbhadhaaran karne vaali yoni arthath mata he
 The word Dharma is used in the Gita from place to place for self-nature and living nature
 isi paripeksh main dharm evam adharm ko samajhnaa aavashyak he
 The nature of the soul is religion or it is said that religion is spirit
 aatma kaa swabhaav he purna shuddh gyaan, gyaan hi anand or shaanti kaa akshay dham he
 On the contrary, ignorance signifies unrest, tribulation and unrighteousness
 aatma akshay gyaan kaa strot he
 Kriya Shakti arises from different amounts of knowledge power, birth of nature
 prakruti ke gun satva, raj, tam kaa janm hota he
 Excess of sattva-raja gives rise to religion, demonic circles prevail in excess of tam-raja and the establishment of dharma means to establish the nature of virtues, for the growth of satoguna, soul attaining indestructible Brahmi status, its resolve She incarnates herself and performs incarnation
 sampoorn gita shaastra kaa nichod he buddhi ko hameshaa sookshm karte hue mahabuddhi aatma main lagaaye rakkho tathaa sansar ke karm apane swabhaav ke anusaar saral rup se karte raho
 It is easy to do nature's karma and it is difficult to follow the other's nature's karma, because every living being is born with a different nature, it becomes easy to live in the nature that has come into the world
 shri bhagwaan ne sampoorn gita shaastra main baar-baar atmrat, aatm sthit hone ke liye kaha he
 It is easy for the intellect to become detached while doing natural deeds, so it is considered the definitive path
 yadhyapi alag-alag dekha jaay to gyaan yoga, buddhi yoga, karm yoga, bhakthi yoga aadi kaa gita main upadesh diya he parantu sookshm drushti se vichaar kiya jaay to sabhi yoga buddhi se shri bhagwaan ko arpan karte hue kiye ja sakate hai isse anasakt yoga nishkaam karm yoga swatah siddh ho jaataa he
 Just as before Newton the force of gravity worked, but Newton gave the terms of the term to make the world aware of the proclaimed principles of "law of gravity", which is known as Newton's theory of gravitation
