 The order of this mushaf differed from that which was later gathered during the Uthmanic era
 is pustak ko kai logon ne khaarij kar diya jab unhone unhen dikhaaya
 Despite this, Ali made no resistance against the standardized mus'haf
 apane jivan ke aakhri saalon main arab janajatiyon ko ek muslim dharmik raajnneeti main ekajute karne ke baad, 632 main mohammad kii mrityu ne is baat par asahmati vyakt kii ki muslim samudaay ke netaa ke rup main unhen koun safal karegaa
 While Ali and the rest of Muhammad's close family were washing their bodies for burial, a small group of Muslims took part in Saqifah, one of Muhammad's close companions, Abu Bakr, was named to lead the community
 dusron ne apana samarthan joda or abu bakar ko pehla khalipha banaaya gaya tha
 The choice of Abu Bakr was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who said that Ali was nominated by Muhammad as his successor
 baad main jab fatimah or ali ne khalipha ke adhikaar ke maamle main sahaygiyon se sahaayta maangi, to unhone uttar diya, 'he bhagwaan ke macenjar kii beti! hamane abu bakar ko apana nishtha diya he
 If Ali had come to us earlier, we certainly would not have abandoned him
 ali ne kaha, 'kya yah uchit tha ki paigambar ko dafnaae jane se pehle hamen khalipha par jhagada karnaa chahie?' After the Khilafat election, Abu Bakr and Umar along with some other companions went to Fatima's house to force Ali and his supporters who had gathered to pledge their allegiance to Abu Bakr
 phir, yah aarope lagaaya gaya he ki umr ne aag lagane kii dhamkee di thi jab tak ve baahar nahin aae or abu bakar ke prati nishtha kii kasam khai
 Fatima, in support of her husband, triggered a seduction and threatened to "expose her hair", to which Abu Bakr repented and withdrew
 ali ne baar-baar kaha he ki unke saath chalis purush the, unhone virodh kiya hoga
 Ali did not actively assert his authority because he did not want to throw the nascent Muslim community into conflict
 anya sutron kaa kahana he ki ali ne umr ke chayan ko khalipha ke rup main sweekaar kar liya or yahaan tak ki unki betiyon um kulthum ko shaadi main bhi diya
 This controversial issue later divided Muslims into two groups, Sunni and Shia
 sunnis ne jor dekar kaha ki mohammad ne kabhi uttaradhikari niyukt nahin kiya he, phir bhi abu bakar muslim samudaay dwaara pehle khalif chune gaye the
 Sunnis identify the first four Caliphs as the rightful successors of Muhammad
 shiyas kaa maananaa he ki mohammad ne spasht rup se ali ko gadir khum main unke uttaradhikari ke rup main namit kiya or muslim netritv unase sambandhit tha jo divya aadesh dwaara nirdhaarit kiye gaye the
 According to Wilferd Madelung, Ali himself was convinced of his legitimacy for the Caliph based on his close association with Muhammad, his close relationship and his knowledge of Islam and his qualifications in serving his virtues
 unhone abu bakar se kaha ki khalipha ke rup main nishtha ko pratigya karne main unki deree unke pehle ke sheershak kii unki dharna par aadhaarit thi
 Ali ultimately pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr and then to Umar and Uthman, but did so for the unity of Islam, once it became clear that the Muslims had turned away from him
 ali ne yah bhi mana ki vah is ladaai ke bina imamet kii apni bhoomika puri kar saktaa he
 At the beginning of the Caliphate of Abu Bakr, there was a dispute between Muhammad's daughter, especially Phadak, Fatimah and Ali on one side and Abu Bakr on the other
 fatima ne abu bakar se apni sampatti, fada or khayabar kii bhoomi ko badalane ke liye kaha 
 But Abu Bakr refused and told him that the prophets had no inheritance and that Phadak belonged to the Muslim community
 abu bakar ne usase kaha, "allaah ke prerit ne kaha, hamaare uttaradhikari nahin hai, jo kuch bhi ham chhodte hai vah sadaaka he 
 "together with Umm Ayman, Ali testified to the fact that Muhammad gave it to Fatima Zahra, when Abu Bakr requested him to summon witnesses for his claim
 fatima gusse main ho gai or abu bakar se baat karnaa band kar diya, or jab tak vah mar gai, tab tak vah ravaiya maanate rahe
 'aisha also states that "when the Apostle of Allah died, his wives asked Uthman to send Abu Bakr to ask for his share of the inheritance
 " tab 'aisha ne unase kaha, "kya allaah ke prerit ne nahin kaha,' hamaari sampatti viraasat main nahin he, or jo bhi ham chhodte hai vah daan main kharch kiya janaa chahie?" According to some sources, Ali did not swear allegiance to Abu Bakr sometime after the death of his wife Fatima in the year 633
 'ali ne abu bakar ke antim sanskaar main bhaag liya
 He pledged allegiance to the second Khalifa Umar ibn Khattab and helped him as a trusted advisor
 umr vishesh rup se ali par madina ke mukhya nyaayadhish ke rup main nirbhar tha
 He advised Umar to set the hijra as the beginning of the Islamic calendar
 umr ne raajnneetik muddon ke saath-saath dharmik logon main ali ke sujhaavon kaa istemaal kiya
 'ali was one of the electoral council to elect a third caliph appointed by Omar
 haalanki 'ali do pramukh ummidavaaron main se ek tha, parishad kii vyavastha unke khilaaf thi
 Saad ibn Abi Waqqas and Abdur Rahman bin Awf, who were cousins, were naturally inclined to support Uthman, who was Abdur Rahman's son-in-law
 iske alaava, umr ne abdur rahamaan ko casting vot diya
 Abdur Rahman offered the Caliph to Ali on the condition that he should rule according to the Quran, the example set by Muhammad, and the precedent set by the first two Caliphs
 ali ne teesri shart se inkaar kar diya jabaki uthman ne use sweekaar kar liya
 His reputation at the summit of Ilokens Ali was emphasized according to the comments of Ilon Abi al-hadid, but most voters reluctantly urged Uthman and Ali to support him
 'uthman ebn' afaan ne apane rishtedaar banu abd-shams kii ore udaartaa vyakt kii, jo unke upar haaavee hone lagate the, or abu dhar al-ghifaari, abd-allaah ebn masood or amaar jaise kai shuruaati saathi ke prati unke ghamandi durvyavhaar ebn yasir ne logon ke kuch samoohon ke bich apmaan ko uksaaya
 Dissatisfaction and resistance openly arose in most of the empire from 650–651 onwards
 unke shashan or unke dwaara niyukt sarkaron ke saath asantosh arab ke baahar praanton tak hi simit nahin tha
 When Uthman's relatives, especially Marwan, gained control over him, the Great Council, which included most of the members of the Voters' Council, turned against him or at least withdrew his support, pressuring the Caliphate and his ways
 Reducing the impact of your firm relationship
 is samay, ali ne uthman par sidhe virodh kiye bina ek sanyam prabhaav ke rup main kaary kiya tha
 On several occasions Ali disagreed with Udhaman in the application of Hudud; He had publicly shown sympathy for Abu Dhrr al-ghifari and spoke strongly in defense of Ammar ibn Yasir
 unhone uthman ko anya sahyogiyon kii aalochanaon ke bare main bataaya or uthman kii taraf se prantiy virodhiyon ke saath vaartakar ke rup main kaary kiya jo madina aae the; is vajah se ali or uthman ke parivaar ke bich kuch avishvaas utpann hua prathit hota he
 Eventually, he tried to reduce the severity of the siege with his insistence that Uthman should be allowed water
 itihaaskaaron ke bich ali or uthman ke bich sambandhon ke bare main vivaad he
 Although pledging allegiance to Uthman, Ali disagreed with some of his policies
 vishesh rup se, unhone dharmik kanoon ke sawaal par uthman ke saath sangharsh kiya
 He insisted that religious punishment should be done in many cases like Ubaid Allah ibn Umar and Walid ibn Ukba
 tirthayatra ke dauraan 650 main, unhone uthman se prarthana anushthan ke parivartan ke liye apmaan ke saath saamana kiya
 When Uthman announced that he would take whatever he had from the fees, Ali said that the caliph would be forced into that case
 ali ne ebn masood jaise khalipha dwaara maatrutiv se saathi kii raksha karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Therefore, some historians consider Ali as one of the leading members of Uthman's opposition, if not the chief
 lekin wilferd madelangais tathy ke kaaran unke faisle ko khaarij kar diya gaya ki ali ke paas khalipha ke rup main chune jane ke liye kuraishi kaa samarthan nahin tha
 According to him, there is no evidence that Ali had close ties with the rebels who supported his caliphate or directed his actions
 kuch anya sutron kaa kahana he ki ali ne uthman par sidhe virodh kiye bina ek sanyam prabhaav ke rup main kaary kiya tha
 However, Madelang told Marwan that Ali's grandson Zayn al-abidin had said that koi bhi aapke guru kii tulana main hamaare guru kii tulana main adhik samshitoshna tha
 During one of the most difficult periods in Muslim history, Ali was the Caliph between 656 and 661, which also coincided with the first Fitnah
 chunki jin sangharshon main ali shaamil the, ve dhruviya sampradayik itihaslekh main kaayam the, jeevani saamagree aksar pakshpatpurna hoti he
 But the sources agree that he was a deeply religious man, who was ruled by justice because of Islam and according to the Quran and Sunnah; He was engaged in a war against Muslims in terms of religious duties
 sutron ne apane tapasya, dharmik kartavyon kaa kathor paalan, or sansaarik vastuon se alag hone par notice main ullekh kiya he
 Thus some authors have reported that they lack political skills and flexibility
 uthman kii hatya kaa matlab tha ki vidrohiyon ko ek nayaa khalipha chunanaa padaa
 This met with difficulties as the rebels were divided into several groups including Muhajirun, Ansar, Egyptians, Kufans and Basarites
 teen ummidavaar the: ali, talhah or al-jubayr 
 First the rebels approach Ali, requesting him to be the fourth Caliph
 mohammad ke kuch saathi ne ali ko karyaalay sweekaar karne ke liye raji karne kii koshish kii, lekin unhone prastaav ko band kar diya, ek pramukh ke bajaay paramarshdaata hone kaa suzav diya
 Talha, Zubayr, and other companions refused the Khalifa's offer of rebels
 isliye, vidrohiyon ne madina ke nivaasiyon ko ek din ke bheetar ek khalipha chunane kii chetavanee di, yaa ve kathor karrwai lagu karenge
 To resolve the deadlock, Muslims gathered at al-masjid an-nabawi on June 18, 656 to appoint a caliph
 prarambh main, 'ali ne ise sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya, kyonki sirf unke sabase shashakt samarthak vidrohiyon the
 However, when some of Muhammad's notable companions other than the residents of Medina urged him to accept the offer, he eventually agreed
 abu mekhanaaf ke mutabikka varnan, talhah pehle pramukh saathi the jinhone 'ali ko apana pratigya di, lekin anya kathaon ne anyathaa daawa kiya ki unhen apni pratigya dene ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 In addition, Talhah and az-zubayr later claimed that they reluctantly supported him
 bhale hi, ali ne in daavon ko khaarij kar diya, jor dekar kaha ki unhone unhen sleep swechha se manyata di he
 Wilferd Madelung believes the force did not urge people to pledge and publicly pledged at the mosque
 jabaki madina kii aabaadi ke saath-saath kai vidrohiyon ne apni pratigya di, kuch mahatvapurn aankade yaa janajatiyon ne aisa nahin kiya
 Uthman's relatives fled to the Umayyad Levant, or remained in their homes, later denying 'ali's legitimacy'
 saad ebn abi vakkaas anupasthit the or 'abdulla ebn' umr ne apane nishtha kii peshkash karne se roak diya, lekin donon ne 'ali ko aashwaasan diya ki ve unke khilaaf kaary nahin karenge
 Ali thus inherited the Rashidun Caliphate — which stretched from Egypt in the west to the Iranian hills in the east — while the situation in Hejaz and other provinces on the eve of his election was unsettled
 ali khalipha banane ke turant baad, unhone prantiy governron ko khaarij kar diya jinhen uthman ne niyukt kiya tha, unhen bharosemand sahyogiyon ke saath badal diya tha
 He acted against the lawyers of Mugira ibn Shuba and Ibn Abbas, who had carefully advised them to proceed with their rule
 madelang kaa kahana he ki ali apane adhikaar or unke dharmik mishan se gaharaai se aashwast the, raajnneetik yogyata ke liye apane siddhanton se samjhauta karne ke icchhuk nahin the, or baari baadhaon ke khilaaf ladane ke liye taiyaar the
 Mu'awiyah I, the founder of Uthman and the governor of the Levant, refused to submit to Ali's orders; He was the only governor to do so
 hagiya sophia main islamic sulekh ke saath ali kaa naam, jab unhen khalipha niyukt kiya gaya, ali ne madina ke nagarikon se kaha ki muslim raajnneeti asantosh or vivaad se peedit hui he; vah kisi bhi buraai ke islam ko shuddh karnaa chahta tha
 He advised the population to behave as true Muslims, warning that it would not tolerate any treason and that those found guilty of subversive activities would be dealt with harshly
 aaisha, talha, al-zubair or umayyadon, vishesh rup se muawiyah i or maravan main, dangaiyon jo maar daalaa tha dandit karne ke liye karnaa chahta tha 'ali uthman
 They camped close to Basra
 vaarta kai dinon tak chali or baad main garam vinimay or parali ke dauraan virodh pradarshnon se uda, jisase donon taraf jivan kii haani hui
 The battle of camels in confusion began in 656, where Ali emerged victorious
 kuch itihaaskaar maanate hai ki unhone is mudde kaa istemaal apni raajnneetik mahatvakankshaon ko khojane ke liye kiya kyonki unhen ali ke khalipha apane phaayde ke khilaaf mila
 The rebels said that Uthman was executed for not ruling according to the Quran and Sunnah, so no retaliation was to be done
 kuch log kehete hai ki khalipha vidrohiyon kaa uphaar tha or ali ke paas unhen niyantrit karne yaa dandit karne ke liye paryaapt bal nahin tha, jabaki anya kehete hai ki ali ne vidrohiyon ke tark ko sweekaar kiya yaa kam se kam vichaar nahin kiya uthman ek shaasha shaasha
 Under such circumstances, a dispute ensued that started the first civil war in Muslim history
 uthamanion ke naam se jane vaale kuch musalamaanon ne uthman ko ant tak ek sahi or sirf khalipha mana, jise avaidh tareeke se maar diya gaya tha
 Some others, known as Ali's party, believed that Uthman had fallen into error, seized the caliphate and refused to reform or step in their own way legally
 Was executed in law; Thus Ali was just and true Imam and atheists among his opponents
 yah khud ali kii sthiti nahin thi
 This civil war created permanent divisions within the Muslim community who had legitimate authority to occupy the Caliphate
 pratham fitnaa, 656-661, uthman kii hatya ke baad, ali ke khalipha ke dauraan jari rakhaa, or khalipha ke muavia kii dharna dwaara samaapt kiya gaya tha
 This civil war is regretted as the end of the early unity of the Islamic Ummah
 ali ne basra ke governor 'abd allaah ebn al'-abbaas niyukt kiye or iraq main muslim garrison shahar kupha main apni rajdhani chali gai
 After the roman-persian Wars and the Byzantine Sasani War that lasted for hundreds of years, there were deep-rooted differences between Iraq, formally in the Persian Sassanid Empire and Syria formally under the Byzantine Empire
 iraqi chaahate the ki nae sthapit islamic rajya kii rajdhani kupha main ho taaki ve apane kshetra main rajasav laa saken or syria kaa virodh kar saken
 He convinced Ali to come to Kufa and establish a capital at Kufa in Iraq
 baad main levant ke governor muvayah pratham or uthman ke chachere bhai ne ali kii nishtha kii maangon se inkaar kar diya
 Ali opened up hopes of regaining his allegiance, but Muawiyah insisted on Levant autonomy under his rule
 muvayah ne apane laventine samarthakon ko sangathit karke or ali ko shradhanjali arpit karne se inkaar kar diya ki unke dal ne apane chunaav main bhaag nahin liya tha
 Ali shifted his forces to the north and the two armies encamped themselves in Siffin for more than a hundred days, most of the time being spent in conversation
 yadhyapi ali ne muvayah ke saath kai patron kaa aadan-pradaan kiya, lekin vah uttararddh ko khaarij karne main asamarth tha, na hi use nishtha dene kaa vachan dene ke liye raji kiya
 a confrontation between the parties led to the Battle of Siffin in 657
 ek saptaah ke yuddh ke baad ek hinsak ladaai ke baad lalit al-harir ke naam se janaa jaataa tha, muvayah kii sena margauntarit hone ke bindu par thi jab amrit ebn al-aas ne muvayah ko apane sainikon ko oochhaalane kii salaah di thi 
 Ali watched through the stratagem, but only a minority wanted to chase the fight
 aakhir main do senaayen is baat ko sulajhane ke liye sahamat huin ki madhyasthata se khalipha koun hona chahie
 The refusal of the largest block in Ali's army to fight was the deciding factor in the acceptance of arbitration
 sawaal yah he ki kya madhyasth ali yaa kufaan kaa pratinidhitiv karegaa, ali kii sena main aage vibhaajan hua he
 Ashath ibn q and some others rejected Ali's candidates as 'abd Allah ibn' Abbas and Malik al-ashtar, and insisted on Abu Musa Ashari for his neutrality
 ant main, ali ko abu musa ko sweekaar karne kaa aagrah kiya gaya tha
 Amrit ibn al-a was appointed by Mu'awiyah as a mediator
 saat maheene baad do madhyasthon ne farvari 658 main jordan main maan ke uttar pashchim main 10 mile uttar pashchim main mulaakaat kii
 Amrit ibn al-abu Musa Ashari assured that both Ali and Mu'awiyah should step in and elect a new caliph
 ali or unke samarthak is faisle se dar gaye the, jisane khalipha ko vidrohi muvayah kii sthiti main kam kar diya tha
 Therefore Ali was called by Mu'awiyah and Amr ibn al-s
 jab daumit-ul-jandal main madhyasthon ne ikattha kiya, to unke liye maamalon kii charchaa karne ke liye dainik baithkon kii ek shrinkhalaa kii vyavastha kii gai
 When it came time to make a decision about the Caliph, Amrit bin al-aas convinced Abu Musa al-ashari to entertain that he should deprive both Ali and Mu'awiya of the Caliphate, and the Muslims to make elections
 The Caliph Abu Musa al-ashari also decided to act accordingly
 punavala ke anusaar, aisa lagata he ki madhyasthon ke bahishkaar ke saath madhyasth or anya pratishthit vyaktiyon ne janvari 65 9 main nae khalif ke chayan par charchaa ke liye mulaakaat kii
 Amrit supported Muawiyah, while Abu Musa preferred his son-in-law Abdullah ibn Umar, but the latter unanimously refused to stand for election
 abu musa ne prastaavit kiya, or amrit sahamat hue, ali or muvayah donon ko chhodane or shura ko nae khalif kaa chayan jamaa karne ke liye sahamat hue
 The public declaration after Abu Musa saw his share of the pact, but Amrit declared Ali and confirmed Muawiya as the Caliph
 ali ne unke faisle ko sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya or chunaav hone ke liye or madhyasthata kaa paalan karne ke liye apane pratigya kaa ulanghan karne main takneekee rup se paaya
 Ali protested, stating that it was not binding on the contrary to the Quran and Sunnah
 phir usne ek nai sena ko vyavasthit karne kii koshish kii, lekin malik ashtar kii aguai main kurr ke avshesh ansaar, or unke kuch kulon ne vafaadaar bane rahe
 This also put Ali in a vulnerable position among his supporters
 madhyasthata ke parinamswaroop 'ali ke gathbandhan ke vighatan main, or kuch ne kaha he ki yah muvayah kaa iraadaa tha
 The most vocal opponents in Ali's camp were the same people who forced Ali into a ceasefire
 unhone ali ke bal se tod diya, naaraazgi ke tahat raily "madhyasthata akele bhagwaan se sambandhit he
 “this group came to be known as Kharijites
 unhone sabhi ko apana dushman mana
 In 659 Ali's army and Kharijites met at the Battle of Naharvan
 tab kurra kharijiyon ke naam se janaa jane laga
 The Kharijites then started killing Ali's supporters and other Muslims
 unhone kisi aise vyakti ko mana jo avishvasi ke rup main apane samooh kaa hissaa nahin tha
 Although 'ali won the battle by a large margin, the constant struggle was beginning to affect his position
 iraqiyon se nipatane ke dauraan, ali ko ek anushaasit sena or prabhavi rajya sansthaanon kaa nirmaan karnaa mushkil ho gaya
 He spent a lot of time fighting the Kharijites
 natijatan, 'ali ko apane purvi morche par rajya kaa vistaar karnaa mushkil ho gaya
 Around the same time, unrest was brewing in Egypt
 misr ke rajyapal, kus ko yaad kiya gaya tha, or ali ne unhen mohammad ebn abi bakar ke saath badal diya tha
 Mu'awiyah allowed 'amrit ibn al' to conquer Egypt and Amrit successfully did so
 amrit ne pehle romanon se atharah saal pehle misr liya tha lekin uthman ne use barkhaast kar diya tha
 Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr had no popular support in Egypt and managed to reunite with 2000 men but they dispersed without fighting
 agle varshon main, muvayah kii sena ne iraq ke kai shaharon par kabja kar liya, jo ali ke governor nahin roak sake, or logon ne unke saath ladane ke liye unka samarthan nahin kiya
 Mu'awiyah defeated Egypt, Hijaz, Yemen and other regions
 ali ke khalipha ke aakhri saal main, kupha or basra main manodasha unke paksh main badal gaya kyonki log muvayah ke shasankaal or nitiyon se bhramit ho gaye
 However, people's attitude towards Ali was profoundly different
 unamem se keval ek choti alpsankhyak kaa maananaa tha ki ali mohammad ke baad sabase acha muslim tha or keval un par shashan karne kaa hakdaar tha, jabaki bahumat ne unhen muvayah ke avishvaas or virodh ke kaaran samarthan diya tha
 Ali is said to have sworn in and forewarned an inconsistent campaign against financial corruption and unfair privileges within the caliph's ranks after Uthman was pressed by the public to succeed in the caliphate
 shiyas kaa tark he ki abhijaat varg ke saath apni alokapriyata ke baavjood in sudhaaron ko dhakka dene main unka drudh sankalp amir or paigambar ke visheshadhikaar praapt purv saathi se shatruta kaa kaaran rahaa he
 In a famous letter to his governor Malik Ashtar, he expressed his pro-anti-poor attitude: yaad rakhen ki saamaanya purushon kii naapsand or asweekruti, mahatvapurn vyaktiyon kii sweekruti or kuch bade logon kii naaraazgi se adhik asantulan se adhik logon ko pareshaan nahin kiya jaataa he, yadi aapke vishay ke aam janata or jansampark aapke saath khush hai

 more friendly with them and securing their confidence and sympathy
 'ali ne uthman dwaara di gai bhoomi ko waapas laayaa or apane chunaav se pehle praapt hue kuch bhi hasil karne ke liye kasam khai
 Ali opposed the centralization of capital control over provincial revenue, favoring equal distribution of taxes and plunder among Muslim citizens; He distributed the entire revenue of the treasury among them
 'ali ne apane bhai' akel ebn abu talib sahit bhakthivaad se bachanaa
 This was a sign for Muslims of their policy of offering equality to Muslims, who served Islam in its early years and played a role in the subsequent conquest of Muslims
 ali ek vyapak gathbandhan banane main safal rahaa, khaskar oont kii ladaai ke baad 
 His policy of equal distribution of taxes and plunder gained the support of Muhammad's companions, especially the Ansar, who were subordinated by the Quraysh leadership after Muhammad, the traditional tribal leaders, and the Qur'a or Quranic readers who sought pious Islamic leadership

 Although many people at this time were counted as political Shiites, some of them believed in Ali's religious leadership
 misr ke governor kii niyukti ke baad malik al-ashtar ko bheje gaye patr main unki nitiyon or shashan ke vichaar prakat hue hai
 This directive, which has historically been seen as the ideal constitution for Islamic rule with the Constitution of Medina, at that time included a detailed account of the duties and rights of the ruler and various functionaries of the state and the main sections of society
 ali ne malik al-ashtar ko unke nirdeshon main likhaa tha: Since most of Ali's people were nomads and farmers, he was concerned with agriculture
 unhone malik ko kar ke sangrah kii tulana main bhoomi ke vikaas par adhik dhyaan dene kaa nirdesh diya, kyonki kar keval jameen ke vikaas se praapt kiya ja saktaa he or jo koi bhi jameen viksit kiye bina kar maangata he, vah desh ko barbaad kar detaa he or logon ko nasht kar detaa he

 He was wounded by Ibn Muljam's poison-coated sword while prostituting in Fajr prayer
 'ali ne apane beton ko kharijiyon par hamalaa nahin karne kaa aadesh diya, balki yah nirdhaarit karte hue ki yadi vah jivit rahe, to ebn mulajam ko maaf kar diya jayega, jabaki yadi unki mrityu ho gai, to ebn mulajam ko keval ek samaan hit diya janaa chahie 
 Ali died on 29 January 661, two days later
 al-hasan ne kus ko puraa kiya or ali kii maut par ebn mulajam ko samaan sajaa di
 After Ali's death, the Kufi Muslims pledged allegiance to their eldest son, Hassan, without controversy, as Ali had on several occasions declared that the people of the House of Muhammad were entitled to rule the Muslim community
 is samay, muvayah ne levent or misr donon ko rakhaa or muslim samrajya main sabase badi takat ke commander ke rup main, khud ko khalipha ghoshit kar diya or hasan ke khalipha kii seat par apni sena ko iraq main ghumaya
 The war ensued during which Mu'awiyah gradually betrayed the generals and commanders of Hasan's army large sums of money and promises until the army rebelled against him
 aakhirkaar, hasan ko shanti banane or kuwaipha ko muvayah main paidaa karne ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 In this way Mu'awiyah captured the Islamic Caliphate and tuned it into a secular empire

 According to Shia, Ali himself testified: quran kii ek bhi kavita nahin thi par prakat kiya gaya tha, jise usne mujhe nirdeshit karne or mujhe padhane ke liye aage nahin bade 
 i will write it with my own hand, and he will direct me as his tafsir and tawil, nasikh and manasamukh, muhakkam and matasabih, special and general 


 seyad hosen nasar ke mutabik, ali ko islamic dharamshastra sthapit karne kaa shrey diya jaataa he or unke uddharanon main bhagwaan kii ekta ke musalamaanon ke bich pehla tarksangat saboot shaamil he
 Ibn Abi al-hadid has quoted siddhant ke liye or divyata ke maamalon se nipatane ke liye, yah ek arab kala nahin thi
 Nothing of the sort was transmitted among their distinguished figures or among some of the lower ranks
 yah kala greece kaa anany sangrakshit tha, jiskaa rishi keval ekmaatr vistaarak tha
 Ali was the first to strike a deal between the Arabs
 baad main islamic darshan, vishesh rup se mullah sadara or uske anuyaayiyon kii shikshaaon main, alemeh taababatei kii tarah, ali ke kahaniyon or upadeshon ko aadhyatmik gyaan, yaa divya darshan ke kendriya sroton ke rup main teji se mana jaataa tha
 Members of Sadra's school consider Ali to be the supreme spiritual healer of Islam
 henry corbin ke anusaar, nahaj al-balagha ko shiya vichaarkon dwaara vishesh rup se 1500 ke baad kiye gaye siddhanton ke sabase mahatvapurn sroton main se ek mana ja saktaa he
 Its effect can be felt in the logical coherence of words, the deduction of correct conclusions, and the construction of certain technical terms in Arabic which entered the literary and philosophical language independently of the translation of Arabic texts into Arabic
 iske alaava, kuch chupe hue yaa gupt vigyaan jaise jafar, islamic ank vigyaan, or arabi varnmaala ke aksharon ke pratikatmak mahatv ke vigyaan, ali dwaara sthapit kiya gaya he, jiske madhyam se unhone al- jafar or al-jamiya
 Ali was also a great scholar of Arabic literature and a pioneer in the field of Arabic grammar and politics
 ali kii kai choti kahaniyaan saamaanya islamic samskruti kaa hissaa ban gai hai or dainik jivan main utsaah or kahaniyon ke rup main uddhrut hai
 They have also become the basis of literary works or have been integrated into poetic poetry in many languages
 8 veen shatabdi main, saahitiyik adhikariyon jaise 'abd al-hamid ebn yahya al-amiri ne ali ke upadeshon or kahaniyon ke adwitiya uccharan kii ore ishaara kiya, jaisaa ki nimnlikhit shatabdi main al-jahiz ne kiya tha
 The employees of Umayyad's Divan also read Ali's teachings to improve their eloquence
 ali ke shabdon or lekhan kaa sabase prasiddh chayan 10 veen shatabdi ke shiya vidwaan, al-sharif al-radio dwaara nahaj al-balgha naamak pustak main ikattha kiya gaya he, jinhone unhen apane ekvachan rotorical ke liye chunaa sundarataa
 Among the sermons quoted in the book are the note, the unseen sermon as well as Aleph's sermon
 kathaon ke mutabik, mohammad ke kuch saathi bolne main aksharon kii bhoomika par charchaa kar rahe the
 He concluded that Aleph had the greatest contribution in speaking and that the dotted letters were also important
 is bich, ali ne do lambey achook upadeshon ko padhaa, ek shell lekhak langroudi ke mutabik, alef patr kaa upyog kiye bina or duusare ko bina dot kiye gaye aksharon ke, gahare or vakprachaar avadharanaon ke bina
 George Jordac, a Christian writer, said that preaching without Aleph and Dot was to be regarded as a literary masterpiece
 ali ko garib or anathon ke liye gahari sahanubhuti or samarthan ke liye sammanit kiya jaataa he, or saamaajik nyaay praapt karne ke uddeshy se unhone apane khalipha ke dauraan samaan samtawadi nitiyon kaa paalan kiya
 He is quoted as saying: yadi bhagwaan kisi bhi vyakti ko dhan or samruddhi pradaan karata he, to use apane yogya kith or rishtedaaron ko dayalutaa dikhaani chahie, garibon ko pradaan karnaa chahie, un logon kii sahaayta karnaa chahie jo aapadaaon, durbhaagya or reverse se peedit hai, garibon kii madad kerani chahie or eemaandaar logon ko apane rin ko samaapt karne main sahaayta kerani chahie 


 It is narrated in the book al-kafi that Amir al-mu'minin Ali ibn Abi Talib was presented with honey and figs from places near Baghdad
 uphaar praapt karne par, usne apane adhikariyon ko anathon ko laane kaa aadesh diya taaki ve shahad ko contenron se chaatna kar saken jabaki unhone swayan ko logon ke bich aaraam diya
 Nahj al-balgha contains speaking sermons, letters and quotations attributed to Ali which have been compiled by ash-sharif ar-radi
 reja shah kazemi kehete hai: "paath kii pramanikta ke bare main chal rahe prashnon ke baavjood, haalia chaatravrutti se pataa chalata he ki isamen adhikansh saamagree vastav main ali ko jimmedaar tehraaya ja saktaa he" or iske samarthan main vah mokhatar jebli dwaara ek lekh kaa sandarbh detaa he
 This book has a prominent position in Arabic literature
 ise islam main ek mahatvapurn bauddhik, raajnneetik or dharmik kaary bhi mana jaataa he
 Nahjul Balagha's Urdu translator Syed Zeeshan Haider Jawadi has compiled a list of 61 authors and their authors from AH 204 to 488, and has provided sources in which Sharif's compilation work Razi can be traced

 In addition, Nahj al-saadah fi Mustadrak by Muhammad Baqir al-mahmudi represents the current speeches, sermons, rules, letters, prayers and stories of the gathering of Nahj al-balaghah Ali
 isamen nahaj al-balagha or anya pravachan shaamil hai jinhen raakh-sharif aar-radio dwaara shaamil nahin kiya gaya tha yaa unke liye uplabdh nahin the
 Apparently, the original sources of all the material of Nahj al-balagha have been determined, except for some aphorisms
 sunnis or shiyas jaise ebn abi al-hadeed kii tippaniyan or mohammad abdudh kii tippaniyon ke bare main kai tippaniyan hai 
 Main article: Ali ibn Abi Talib and Alawi's descendants initially married Fatima, his dearest wife
 uski mrityu ke baad, vah phir se shaadi kar lee
 He had four children with Fatima, Hasan ibn Ali, Hussain ibn Ali, Zainab Bint Ali and Umm Kulthum Bint Ali
 unke anya jane-maane bete al-abbaas ebn ali the, jo fatima binate hijaam or mohammad ebn al-hanafiyah ke liye paidaa hue the
 Muhammad ibn al-hanafiyyah was from the Hanifa dynasty of central Arabia, another wife, Ali's son named Khawala bint Jafar
 fatima kii maut ke baad, ali ne bani hanipha janajati ke khawala bint jafar se vivaah kiya
 Hassan, born in 625, was the second Shia Imam and occupied the Khalifa's outward work for nearly six months
 varsh main eech 50 main vah apane ghar ke ek sadsy dwaara jehar or maar daalaa gaya tha, jaisaa ki itihaaskaaron dwaara jimmedaar tehraaya gaya tha, muaayah dwaara prerit kiya gaya tha
 Hussain, born in 626, was the third Shia Imam
 vah muaayah dwaara daman or utpeedan kii gambhir paristhitiyon main rahete the
 On the tenth day of Muharram of the year 680, he stood in front of the Khalifa's army with his small band of followers and nearly all were killed in the Battle of Karbala
 unki mrityu kii saalagirah aashura kaa din kaha jaataa he or yah shiya musalamaanon ke liye shok or dharmik anushthan kaa din he
 Some of Ali's other sons were killed in this battle
 al-tabari ne apane itihaas main unke naamon kaa ullekh kiya he: hossain ke maanak, jafar, abdllah or uthman ke dharak al-abbaas ebn ali, fatima binate hijaam se paidaa hue chaar bete; mohammad or abu bakar
 The death of the last is suspected
 kuch itihaaskaaron ne ali ke anya putron ke naam jode hai, jo ibrahim, umr or abdllah ebn al-asakar samet karbala main maare gaye the
 His daughter Zainab — who was in Karbala — was captured by Yazid's army and later played a large role in revealing what happened to Hussein and his followers
 fatima dwaara ali ke vanshajon ko sharif, kahaniyaan yaa kahaniyon ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 These are venerable titles in Arabic, Sharif means 'great' and is said or said or 'god' or 'sir'
 mohammad ke ekmaatr vansh ke rup main, unhen sunni or shiya donon kaa sammaan kiya jaataa he
 Apart from Muhammad, there is no one in Islamic history that has been written in Islamic languages as Ali
 muslim samskruti main, ali ko unke saahas, gyaan, vishwaas, eemaandaaree, islam ke prati samarpan, mohammad ko gahari vafadari, sabhi musalamaanon ke samaan upachaar or parajeet dushmano ko kshamaa karne main udaartaa ke liye sammanit kiya jaataa he, or isliye rahasyamay paramparaon ke liye centre he islam main sufiwaad jaise
 Ali retains his stature as an authority on Quranic exegesis, Islamic jurisprudence and religious thought
 ali lagbhag sabhi sufi adeshon main ucch sthaan rakhata he jo unke madhyam se mohammad ko unke vansh kaa pataa lagaataa he
 Ali's influence has been significant throughout Islamic history
 sunni or shiya vidwaan is baat se sahamat hai ki vilaah kii kavita ali ke sammaan main sunai gai thi, lekin vilaayah or imamet kii alag-alag vyakhyaayein hai
 Sunni scholars believe that the poem is about Ali, but he is not identified as an Imam, in Shia Muslim thought, that Ali was chosen by God as Muhammad's successor
 ali yaa anya shiya imam kaa zikr karte hue shiya vidwaanon dwaara vyakhya kiye gaye kai chand hai
 Answering the question as to why the names of the Imams are not mentioned in the Quran, Muhammad al-baqir answers: "allah revealed salat to his Prophet but never said about the three or four rak'ahs, Revealed Zakat but did not mention its details Haj but its Tawaf and Prophet were not counted
 unhone is kavita kaa khulaasa kiya or paigambar ne kaha ki yah kavita ali, hasan, hossain or baarah imam ke bare main he
 "according to Ali a quarter of Quranic verses are telling the Imam's station
 mamen ne in chhandon main se kai ko shiya islam ke parichay main soochibaddh kiya he
 However, there are some verses that some Sunni commentators interpret in the context of Ali, among which Villah's verse that Sunni and Shiite scholars refer to the incident Ali gave his ring to a beggar who prayed rituals in the mosque Asked the devotees
 mavadda kii kavita chhandon main se ek he, donon sunni or shiyite ne ali ke naam ko kuch anya naamon ke saath joda
 The above verse of Mubhala, and also verse 2: 269 in which Ali is honored with unique knowledge by both Shia and Sunni commentators such verses
 shiya mohammad ke baad ali ko sabase mahatvapurn vyakti maanate hai or vah apni smriti main ek jatil, puranic vyakti kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 He is a paragon of virtues, such as courage, greatness, honesty, straightforwardness, eloquence and deep knowledge
 ali dharmi tha lekin anyaay kaa saamana karnaa padaa, vah aadhikarik tha lekin dayaalu or vinamr, joardaar lekin marij bhi, siikhaa lekin shramik vyakti bhi tha
 According to Shia, Muhammad suggested on various occasions during his lifetime that Ali should be the leader of Muslims after his death
 yah kai hadison dwaara samarthit he, jinhen shams dwaara sunaaya gaya he, jisamen khum ke talab ke haddees, do bharpurn chizon ke haddees, kalam or paper ke haddees, clok ke haddees, pad ke haddees, nimath ke nimantran kareebi parivaar, or baarah uttaradhikari ke haddees 
 Jafar al-sadiq narrates in the Hadith that whatever virtue found in Muhammad was found in Ali, who would turn away from Allah and his Prophet, under his guidance
 ali swayan varnan karata he ki vah allaah tak pahunchane ke liye pravesh dwaar or paryvekshak he
 According to this view, Ali as Muhammad's heir did not rule the community in justice, but also interpreted Sharia law and its esoteric meaning
 isliye unhen truti or paap se mukt mana jaataa tha, or mohammad ke madhyam se divya decri dwaara bhagwaan dwaara niyukt kiya gaya tha
 It is believed in Twelver and Ismaili Shi Islam that 'ekal was the source of divine wisdom, the spirits of the prophets and the Imams and was given esoteric knowledge called Goom and their sufferings were a means of divine grace to their devotees
 yadhyapi imam ek divya prakaashan kaa praptakarta nahin tha, phir bhi vah bhagwaan ke saath ghanishtha sambandh tha, jiske madhyam se bhagwaan use maargdarshan karata he, or imam badale main logon kaa maargdarshan karata he
 His words and deeds are a guide and model for the community; as a result it is the source of Sharia law
 shiya tirthayatri aamtaur par ziyaarat ke liye najaaf main mashad ali jate hai, vahaan prarthana karte hai or " ziyaarat amin allaah " yaa anya ziyaaratnanaam padhate hai
 Under the Safavid Empire, his tomb became the center of much devoted attention, exemplified by Shah Ismail i in his pilgrimage to Najaf and Karbala
 kai shiya muslim bhi imam ali kii jayanti ko pita diwas ke rup main manaate hai
 Gregory date changes every year for: mukhya lekh: ali ke sunni drishysunise ali ko chauthe khalipha ke rup main dekhte hai
 Ali is also known as one of the greatest warrior champions of Islam
 udaahranon main trench kii ladaai main kurish champion ko shaamil karnaa shaamil he jab kisi or ne dar nahin diya
 After several unsuccessful attempts to break the fort at the Battle of Khyber, Ali was summoned, miraculously recovered and the fort was conquered
 lagbhag sabhi sufi aadesh ali ke madhyam se mohammad ko apni vanshavali kaa pataa lagaate hai, jo abu bakar ke madhyam se jane vaale nakshabandi ke apwaad hai
 Even in this order, Ali's great great grandson is Jafar al-sadiq
 sufi kaa maananaa he ki ali ne mohammad se santrupt shakti vilaah se viraasat main pravesh kiya jo bhagwaan ko aadhyatmik yatra sambhav banaata he
 Like the famous Sufi Ali Huwiri claims that the tradition started with Ali and regarded the Junayd of Baghdad as the Ali Sheikh doctrines and practices of Sufiism
 suphis ne ali kii prashansa main maanakabat ali ko padhaa 
 Ali is recorded in some traditions as forbidden to those who sought to worship him in his lifetime
 jaise kuch samoohon Alawites vishwaas he ki ali parameshwar tha daawa kar rahe hai avatar
 He is described as Ghulat by the majority of Islamic scholars
 paramparaagat musalamaanon ke mutabik, in samoohon main islam chhod diya gaya he kyonki ve maanav ke prashansaneey gunon ke atvaad ke kaaran hai
 In ali-illahism, a syncretic belief has been consistently there at the religion centers incarnation of their deity throughout history, and reverence especially for Bhandar 'ali, the son of Muhammad, is considered one such incarnation
 druj, ek samadharmi dharm, maanate hai ki bhagwaan tha avatarit manushya main vishesh rup se, al-hakim bi-amr allaah ali ke vanshaj
 See also: Historiography of early Islam The primary sources for scholarship on the life of Ali are the Quran and Ahmadi, along with other texts of early Islamic history
 vyapak madhyamik sroton main, sunni or shia musalamaanon, isai arabon, hinduon or madhya purv or asia ke anya gaiyr-musalamaanon ke lekhan or aadhunik pashchimi vidwaanon dwaara kuch kaaryon ke alaava, shaamil hai
 However, some of the earliest Islamic sources are colored by a positive or negative bias towards Ali
 in kathanon ke khilaaf pehle pashchimi vidwaanon ke bich ek aam pravriti rahi thi or baad main sunni or shia pakshpatpurna padon kii pravriti ke kaaran baad kii avadhi main ekatrit reportein huin; baad main banaavat ke rup main unke bare main aise vidwaan
 This led him to consider some of the reported programs as informal or irrelevant

 Wilferd Madelung has rejected the stance of blindly dismissing everything not included in "early sources" and there is no evidence for a late origin to the trend alone in this approach
 unke anusaar, kaitani kaa drushtikon asangat he
 Madelung and some later historians do not reject narratives compiled in later periods and try to judge them in the context of history and on the basis of their compatibility with events and figures
 abbasid khaliphot ke udai tak, kuch kitaaben likhi gayi or adhikansh report maukhik thim
 The previous most notable work of this period is the book of Sulem ibn Qays, written by Sulem ibn Qays, who was one of Ali's companions who lived before Abbasid

 The length of one finger is equal to the thickness of the finger of a human hand
 vaayu ne manu ke adhikaar ke antargat uparyukt samaan gananaa di he, jo ki manu samhita main nahin ullekith he
 One finger is equal to ten grains of barley
 chah angul baraabar hote hai ek pad ke
 According to Vishnu Purana the human hand dimensions are as follows: - vaayu ne manu ke adhikaar ke antargat uparokt samaan gananaa di he, jo ki manu samhita main nahin ullekith he:- This is not explained in detail
 shrimati trini visteern su vibhakta mahapatha
 1-5-7 7
 shriimatii = glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa = with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii = great, city; dasha cha dve = ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani = yojana-s; aayataa = lengthy; triini vistiirnaa = three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this: 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles

 unhone jor diya ki yuva sadhu vyaayaam karke apane sharir ko sudrudh banaayen or hathiyaar chalaane main bhi kushalta hasil karen
 Therefore, such monasteries were built where such exercises or weapon operations were practiced, such monasteries came to be called akhada
 aam bolchaal kii bhashaa main bhi akhaade un jagahon ko kaha jaataa he jahaan pahalwaan kasarat ke daanvpench sikhte hai
 Later, many more akharas came into existence
 shankaracharya ne akhaadon ko suzav diya ki math, mandiron or shraddhaluon kii raksha ke liye jarurat padane par shakti kaa prayog karen
 Thus, in those times of external attacks, these fields acted as a protective shield
 kai baar sthaneey raja-maharaj videshi akraman kii sthiti main naga yoddha saadhuon kaa sahyog liya karte the
 Many such glorious wars are described in history in which more than 40 thousand Naga warriors took part
 ahamed shah abdali dwaara mathura-vrindavan ke baad gokul par akraman ke samay naga saadhuon ne uski sena kaa muqabla karke gokul kii raksha kii
 After the independence of India, these Akharas renounced their military character
 in akhaadon ke pramukh ne jor diya ki unke anuyaayi bhartiya samskruti or darshan ke sanatani mulyon kaa adhyayan or anupaalan karte hue sanyamit jivan vyateet karen

 mithila pracheen bharat main ek rajya tha
 It is believed that it is the present-day Terai region of North Bihar and Nepal which was known as Mithila
 mithila kii lokshruti kai sadiyon se chali aa rahi he jo apni bauddhik parampara ke liye bharat or bharat ke baahar jaani jaati rahi he
 Maithili is the main language of this region
 hindu dharmik granthon main sabase pehle iskaa sanket shatapath brahman main tathaa spasht ullekh valmikiy ramayana main miltaa he
 Mithila is mentioned in Mahabharata, Ramayana, Purana and Jain and Buddhist texts
 puranic ullekhon ke anusaar is kshetra kaa sarvaadhik pracheen naam mithila hi praapt hota he; saath hi videh naam se bhi ise sambodhit kiya gaya he
 The name arrowhead proves to be much later according to the mentions received
 videh or mithila namakaran kaa sarvaadhik pracheen sambandh shatapath brahman main ullikhit videgh maathav se judata he
 The early times of Mithila settling are indicated in the above story
 videgh maathav tathaa uske purohit gotam rahuugan saraswati nadi ke tir se purv kii ore chale the
 In front of them, fire was running after the water of the global rivers
 sadanira nadi ko agni sukha nahin sake or videgh maathav dwaara yah puche jane par ki ab meraa nivas kahan ho, agni ne uttar diya ki is nadi ke purv kii ore tumhaara nivas ho
 It is clearly mentioned in the Shatapatha Brahmin that earlier Brahmins did not cross this river and the land here was not fertile
 usamen daldal bahut tha kyonki agni vaishwanar ne uskaa aswadan nahin kiya tha
 But now it is very fertile because the Brahmins have sacrificed it and offered it to the fire
 gandki nadi ke bare main yah bhi ullekh he ki garmi ke baad ke dinon main bhi, arthath kaaphi garmi ke dinon main bhi, yah nadi khub bahati he
 Videha seems to be related to the word Videgh and Mithila with the word Mathav
 shatapath main hi gandaki nadi ke bare main ullekh karte hue spasht rup se videh shabd kaa bhi ullekh hua he
 There it has been said that till now this river is the boundary between Kosala and Vidah countries; And this land has been called the child of Mathav
 valmikiy ramayana tathaa vibhinn puraanon main mithila naam kaa sambandh raja nimi ke putr mithi se joda gaya he
 There is a legend everywhere in these texts with minimal differences that Mithi was born from the churning of Nimi's dead body
 valmikiy ramayana main mithi ke vanshaj ke maithil kahalaane kaa ullekh hua he jabaki puranic granthon main mithi ke dwaara hi mithila ke basaaye jane kii baat spasht rup se kahi gayi he
 In many texts, it is said in many texts that his name was born because of his birth, he was called Vaideh because of his birth from Videha father and his name became Mithi due to his birth from churning
 is prakaar unheen ke naam se unke dwaara shasit pradesh kaa naam videh tathaa mithila mana gaya he
 In the Mahabharata, the name of the state has been called 'mithila' and its rulers have been called 'videha dynasty'
 vrihadvishnupurana ke mithila-mahatmaya main mithila evam tirbhukti donon naam kahe gayi hai
 Due to being situated on the arrow of Mithila and many rivers in the name of Mithi, the name of arrow has been considered because of the enjoyment of arrows
 is granth main ganga se lekar himalay ke bich sthit mithila main mukhya 15 nadiyon kii sthiti maani gayi he tathaa unke naam bhi ginaye gayi hai
 Explaining the significance of Mithila, the mithila-mahatmya section of the Old Age Purana states that there is the ultimate sacred arrowhead consisting of 15 rivers between the Ganges and the Himalayas
 yah tirbhukti mithila sita kaa nimicanan he, gyaan kaa kshetra he or krupa kaa peeth he
 Know that this birthplace Mithila is sinless and innocent
 yah ram ko anand dene vaali tathaa mangaladaayini he
 Prayag etc
 is going to give merit in pilgrimage places but is not able to get Rama; But this Mithila is definitely special in all kinds of appeasing Rama
 jaise saket nagari sansar ke kaaran swaroop he vaise hi yah mithila samast anand kaa kaaran swaroop he
 Therefore Maharsighans reside here for the worship of Rama leaving all the parigras
 shrisavitri tathaa shrigauri jaisi dev-shaktiyon ne yahi janm grahan kiya
 This Mithila is the birthplace of Sarveshwareshwari Sreesita ji herself, who will give all the accomplishments by diligently dwelling
 mahabharat main magadh ke baad mithila kii sthiti maani gayi he
 Describing the Magadha Yatra of Sri Krishna, Arjuna and Bhima, it is mentioned that after crossing the Saryu river, crossing eastern Kosala region and then crossing Mahashon, Gandaki and Sadaniira to Mithila
 punah ganga tathaa mahashon ko paar karke magadh main jane kii baat kahi gayi he
 It seems clear from this that at that time Mithila's position in the north of Magadha has been considered
 vajji pradesh mithila ke antargat hi samavisht tha
 Even in this mention of the Mahabharata, the border area of mithila is indicated elsewhere as far as Gandaki in the west and Ganga in the south
 vrihadvishnupurana main mithila kii seemaa kaa spasht ullekh karte hue kaha gaya he ki- That is, there are 24 yojana starting from Kosi in the east to Gandaki in the west and 16 Yojana extending from the Ganges River in the south to the Himalayan forest in the north
 mahakavi chandaa jha ne uparyukt shloke kaa hi maithili roopantaran karte hue mithila kii seemaa bataate hue likhaa he ki Thus, under the mentioned border, the districts of Bihar, presently in western Champaran, East Champaran, Shivhar, Sitamarhi, Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, Samastipur, Begusarai, Darbhanga, Madhubani, Supaul, Madhepura, Saharsa and Khagaria district The entire area and partial area of bhagalpur district comes
 yah seemaa pracheen ullekhon ke anusaar he sambhawatah kosi kii atyadhik prasiddhi tathaa aniyantrit failaav ke kaaran bhi purvi seemaa kosi ko mana gaya he
 There has been no fixed route to Kosi before the dam was built
 purvi bihar ke sabhi kshetron se praayah kosi bahi he
 Therefore, the whole of eastern Bihar has been a natural part of Mithilanchal before the commencement of West ie West Bengal from Mahananda River
 vrihadvishnupurana main ganga tathaa himalay ke bich sthit mithila ke antargat mukhya 15 nadiyon kii sthiti bataayi gayi he
 Their names are as follows: - ye sab apekshaakrit tatkaaleen badi nadiyon ke naam hai; parantu inke atirikt bhi mithilanchal main anek choti-choti nadiyaan pracheen samay se aaj tak anwarat pravaahit hai or mithila ke 'tirbhukti' naam ko sarthak kar rahi hai
 Apart from being a special place related to shriram-sita, Mithila Devadhidev has been particularly famous as a place of worship of Mahadev
 vrihad vishnupurana ke anusaar yahan ke antarvarti pramukh shivlingon ke naam is prakaar hai:- The names of Sinhasevara Mahadev and Kameshwar Linga have been taken with utmost reverence, mentioning the bordering Shivalingas in the sequence of Mithila Parikrama
 is prakaar yahan ekadash shivlingon ke naam pariganit kiye gayi hai
 In the past, it has been said that after paying obeisance to Sinhasevara Mahadev, starting the circumambulation and going back to Simhaeshwar Mahadev and completing the rules and going home
