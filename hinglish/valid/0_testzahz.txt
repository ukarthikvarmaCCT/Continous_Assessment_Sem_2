 On May 7, 2007, ABC Entertainment overlord Stephen mcpherson announced Lost would have a "highly anticipated and shocking" finale with the 2009–2010 season
 mcfersan ke anusaar "hamen laga ki ek yahi rasta tha jisase lost ko ek uchit rachanaatmak nishkarsh mil saktaa tha "
 Beginning with the 2007–2008 season, the final 48th episode was to air as 16 episodes per season in season 3 and Lost was to conclude in season 6
 lekin lekhakon kii hadtaal ke kaaran satr 4 main 14 or satr 5 main 17 prakaran pradarshit hue
 Season 6 also had 17 episodes planned
 lekin 29 june ko yah ghoshnaa kii gai ki antim satr main ek ghanta atirikt hoga jisase prakaran kii sankhya 18 hogi
 According to executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse "lost has always been seen as a program that has a beginning, a middle and an end", and the announcement of its ending will make viewers "believe the story ends as intended" 
 lindelopha or kus ne kaha ki 2010 kii shrinkhalaa ke samaapan kii taarikh kaa nirnaayak hona "behad muktijnak tha" or isse shrinkhalaa ke centre ko phir se khojane main madad mili
 Lindelof said, "we're not stopping anymore
 " nirmaataaon kii yojana he ki lambe samay se chal rahe rahasyon kaa samaapan kar diya jaayegaa jisame he dhumrapaan rakshas kaa swabhaav, chaar anguuthe vaali tawarat kii akruti, satr 1 ke prakaran house of da rising san' main se adam or eve kii pahchaan or dharm samayik ke khatme ke baad bhi jari rahane kaa kaaran
 Lindelof also indicated that Walt's extraordinary abilities could be explained, although it may not require the character's direct involvement
 mathew fox ne ek saakshaatkaar main kaha ki antim satr main jaik shefrd or jon loke ke kirdaar aamane saamne aayenge
 There is a third way of the last session in which both the timings will "unite" and "go straight together" which will not include any previews or anything else
 " unka yah bhi daawa kiya ki vah ekmaatr kalakaar he jinako shrinkhalaa kii samaapti pataa he, jabaki lindelopha ne yah spasht kiya he ki fox ko keval unke charitra se judi bate hi pataa hai
 During comic-who 2009, there were several news stories related to Season 6
 carlton kus ne kaha kii donon samaykram or aage ke drashyon ke satr kaa samaapan ho chukaa he or ve satr 6 se kuch alag kar rahe he
 According to Josh Holloway, his character Sauer will revert to its old form after the death of Juliet
 haalanki kus or lindelof kaa kahana he ki dharm initiative ab kaarykram main koi badi bhoomika nahin nibhaayega, unhone kaha he ki "dharm- michigan conection" satr 6 main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaayega
 Lindelof says that producers have a direct hand in producing the promotional poster for season 6
 is poster ko pehali baar comic-koun par pradarshit kiya gaya
 There is some meaning of everything in the poster, he also mentioned the Abbey Road cover related to the poster
 satr 6 lost kaa pehla or ekmaatr satr hoga jisame koi bhi purvavlokan yaa aadhikarik prachaar saamagree jaise bhavishya ke prakaran kii jhalak or promo tasviren prakashit nahin hongi kyonki lost ke nirmaataaon ko lagata he ki pehle prakaran kaa ek bhi drishy khulaasa kar saktaa he
 According to Lindelof, "every scene of this program will be basically indicative of what we are doing this year and what we are doing this year is different from our other years of work"
 apane charitra ke vikaas ke saath lost ke prakarnon main kai rahasyamay tatva bhi shaamil he jinako vigyaan katha yaa alokik ghatnaon se sambandhit dikhaaya gaya he
 The creators of the series use these elements to compose the mythology of the series and form the basis of speculation from critics
 is kaarykram kii puranic tatwon main ek "rakshas" he jo dweep par ghumta he ; ek rahasyamayi gut jisko uttarajive "adars" ke naam se sambodhit karte he, ek dharm inishiative naamak sanghathan jinhone dweep par kai shodh ke thikaane bana rakhe he, ek ank kram jo kirdaaron ke bhoot, varttman va bhavishya main aksar dikhataa he or vyaktigat sambandh yaa paatro ke bich kii samakramikta jisase ve aksar anjaan hai
 The series is basically a complex and mysterious story that revolves around many unresolved questions
 lost ke lekhakon or kalakaaron, jo aksar apane prashansakon se online baatcheet karte he, se prosahit hokar darshakon or tivi aalochakon ne rahasyon ko jaanane kii koshish main vyapak siddhaton kii rachana kii he
 Theories mainly include the nature of the island, the origin of the 'monster' and "others", the meaning of the numerals and the reason for the accident and the escape of some passengers
 prashansakon ke bahut main se kuch saarvajanik siddhant kaarykram ke rachanakaaron dwaara charchit or asweekrut kare gaye, jisame sabase aam he ki oshiyaanik flite 815 ke uttarajive mrit he yaa phir nark main hai
 This was specifically ruled out by JJ Abramus
 iske alaava, lindelopha ne un atakalon ko nakaar diya he jinke anusaar antarikshayan yaa duusare grah ke vaasi dweep kii ghatnaon ko prabhavit karte hai yaa phir sab kuch kisi vyakti kii kalpana main ho rahaa he
 Carlton Cuse also rejected the theory that it is a reality TV show on the island and the cast are unaware
 or lindelopha ne is siddhant ko bhi kai baar kaarij kiya ki 'rakshas' ek robot he jaisaa maaikel crickton ke upanyaas pre main tha
 'however, it is important to note that earlier discredited theories, especially those related to the period of time, changed from rejection to inclusion in the series, so that other rejected theories might also be included in the play
 lost main anek aavarti tatv or roopankan he jo aam taur par kahani par koi sidhaa prabhaav nahin daalate hai, lekin is kaarykram kii saahitiyik or darshanik pahalu ko prastut karte hai
 These elements include the arrival of black and white colors, which reflect the dualism and status of the characters; And together, almost all of the characters primarily depict Kate's rebellion; Dysfunctional family situations depicted in the lives of almost all the main characters; Futuristic context, in which Desmond's stopping the end-of-the-world button and the Religion Initiative's goal is to change the standards of the Valenzetti equation and stop the end of humanity; Coincidence vs
 fate, evident by Locke's and Mr
 Echo's proximity, the conflict between science and faith, the war between Jack and Locke over leadership; And references to many literary works, including mention and discussion of particular novels
 isamen kai kirdaaron ke naamon se prasiddh aitihaasik vichaarkon or lekhakon kii ore ishaara kiya gaya he jaise jon loke ke rup main, or unke urf naam jeremi bentham, deniel rosau, desmund hum, juuliyat bark, mikhail bakunin, danniel farade, alois hawking, jorge minkovsky, richard alport or sharlett stepuls louis

 Balaji Vishwanath, the seventh Peshwa from the historical order, is responsible for the actual establishment of the Peshwa power, and for giving the Peshwa status to the dynastic tradition
 kintu, yah parivartan chhatrapati shahu ke sahyog or sahmati dwaara hi sampann hua, uski asamarthta ke kaaran nahin
 Although Balaji Vishwanath's successor, Bajirao, made paramountcy along with the expansion of the Maratha Empire, his legal status was revolutionized by Shahu's death, after the death of Shahu, Balaji's son Balaji

 As a result, grateful Shahu appointed Balaji Vishwanath in 1713 as Peshwa

 During this time, he expanded the empire, and organized governance

 His talent was innate

 Due to Madhav Rao being childless, on his death, he was declared Anuj Narayanrao Peshwa
 vah prakruti se asthir, uddhat tathaa vilaasi tha
 One, his ambitious uncle Raghunathrao was dissatisfied with his situation due to being held captive, second, there was a great uneasiness between his curvy wit wife Anandibai and Peshwa's mother Gopikabai
 at: apni patni se protsaahit ho raghunatharav ne peshwa ke viruddh shadyantr yojit kiya
 Probably initially his goal was only to take Peshwa captive
 kintu 30 agast 1773 ke madhyahn main peshwamahal main narayanrav ke ghere jane par, sambhavat: anandibai ke hi ishaare par, raghunatharav ke anuyaayiyon ne uski hatya kar di

 peshwa balaji bajirao kaa anuj raghunatharav mahatvakankshi tathaa saahsee to tha; kintu saath hi swaarthee, laalchee or dambhi bhi tha
 The failure of two military operations in northern India under the leadership of Raghoba during Balaji Rao's time, as a backdrop to the Battle of Panipat, proved hugely disastrous for Maharashtra
 alpavyask kintu pratibhasampann madhavrao ke padasin hone par use apane prabhutv main rakhane ke dhyey se raaghobaa ne maraathon ke param shatru nizaam se samjhauta kar, aalegaanv me madhavrao ko parajeet kar, use bandi bana liya
 But Madhavrao soon established his full power
 raaghobaa ko bade anushaasan main rahanaa padaa
 After Madhavraj's death, Narayanrao became Peshwa, and Raghaova organized a conspiracy against him, killing him
 ab raaghobaa kaa peshwa ghoshit hone kaa swapn sarthak hua 
 But immediately on being the son of Narayanrao's widow, a successful protest against Ragova arose under the leadership of Nanafdanvis

 Finally, at the end of the war, according to the treaty of Salbai, Rashoba was provided a monthly pension of twenty five thousand rupees by the Peshwa court

 Born 1774: died 1795
 narayanrav kii hatya ke baad raaghobaa apane ko peshwa ghoshit karne main safal hua
 But immediately after the birth of the son of Narayanrao's widow, with the support of public opinion, Nana Fadnavis removed Raghoba and succeeded Madhavrao II, a child of eighteen days a month
 samast rajkeey satta ab peshwa ke abhibhavak naanaa fadanvis ke haathon main kendrit ho gai
 Shaktilalup Nana did not allow Madhavrao's personality to develop

 He was present only for a few moments in Kharada's war against the Nizam

 madhavrao dwitiya kii aakasmik mrityu ke baad maharashtra main avyavashtha tivratar ho uthi
 Often the question of successor remained a problem for seven months
 madhavrao ke nissantan hone ke kaaran vastav main rajdhikaar raaghobaa ke jyeshtha putr bajirao dwitiya kaa tha
 But Nana Fadnavis was in his opposition
 at: naanaa ne bajirao ke anuj chimnaji ko uski asweekruti par bhi padasin karne kaa nishchay kiya
 To make his appointment valid, he was first adopted by Yashodabai, the widow of Madhavrao
 tadnantar 2 june ko uskaa padaarohan hua
 But immediately affected by the internal Deity Nana Fadnavis organized a conspiracy in favor of Bajirao and against Chimnaji
 falat: chimnaji bandi hua, bajirao peshwa niyukt hua
 
 antim aangl-maratha-yuddh kii samaapti par jab bajirao ne angrejon ke sammukh aatmasamarpan kiya, chimnaji banaras jaakar rahane laga, jahaan 1830 main uski mrityu ho gai
 Born 1775 AD 
: Death 1851
 raghunatharav tathaa maratha darbar ke abhibhavak naanaa fadanvis main teevr manomalinya tha
 So, on the death of Madhavrao II, Nana declared Peshwa to be his brother-in-law Chimnaji Appa, rather than Bajirao, but affected by internal strings, Nana immediately removed Chimnaji and declared Bajirao as Peshwa
 
 Bajirao spent most of his life in a prison house as his education initiation remained incomplete
 uski prakruti bhi katu or vikrut ho gai
 Apart from being inept and inexperienced, he was by nature a misdemeanor and disloyal
 apane upkaaree naanaa ke viruddh shadyantr rachakar usne uske antim diwas kshtprad kar die
 With the death of Nana in 1800, Bajirao remained in control - with the removal of control, Bajirao's misbehavior and the Maharashtra chain began to increase
 peshwa dwaara vithoji holkar kii hatya ne yashwantrao holkar ko peshwa kar akraman karne ke liye uttejit kiya
 Peshwa and Scindia were defeated

 In this sequence, the Second anglo-maratha War broke out
 parinamswaroop bajirao ko angarejon kaa prabhutv sweekaar karnaa padaa, tathaa maharashtra kii swatantraaa bhi samaapt ho gai
 In the last anglo-maratha war, the British again forced Bajirao to come to a treaty, which forced him to assert his state authority over the Maratha Confederacy
 antat: yuddh kii samaapti par maratha samrajya hi angrejon ke adhikaar main ho gaya
 Bajirao accepted the pension of the British and went to Vithur and resided

 us kaa prayog mezposh ke rup main, yaa manch par nahin dhakaa ja saktaa, isse kisi murti ko dhakaa nahin ja saktaa na hi kisi aadharshila par daalaa ja saktaa tha
 Until 2005, it could not be used as a dress or as a uniform

 In 'certain circumstances' the flag can be hoisted at night at a government building

 It is also stated in the Samhita tradition that it cannot be hung vertically

 Any person can read the flag like a book from top to bottom and left to right, if it is rotated, the result should be the same
 jhande ko buree or gandi sthiti main pradarshit karnaa bhi apmaan he
 The same rule is for flag columns or ropes when hoisting the flag
 in kaa rakrakhaav acha hona chahie
 Some rules have to be followed to display the flag correctly
 yadi ye kisi bhi manch ke peeche diwaar par samaanaantar rup se failaa die gaye hai to unka fahraav ek duusare ke paas hone chahie or kesaria rang sabase upar hona chahie

 jab rashtriya dhvaj kisi company main anya deshon ke dhwajon ke saath baahar khule main fahraaya ja rahaa ho to uske liye bhi anek niyamon kaa paalan karnaa hoga

 The flags of other countries should be arranged according to the Latin alphabet
 sabhi jhande lagbhag ek hi aakaar ke hone chahie, koi bhi dhvaj bhartiya dhvaj kii tulana main bada nahin hona chahie
 The flag of each country should be on a separate pillar, the national flag of any country should not be hoisted one on top of the other
 aise samay main bhartiya dhvaj ko shuru main, ant main rakhaa jaae or varnakram main anya deshon ke saath bhi rakhaa jaae
 If the flag is to be hoisted in a circular manner, the flag of other countries should be placed clockwise in the direction of the national flag by placing the national flag at the beginning of the cycle, until a flag comes next to the national flag
 bharat kaa rashtriya dhvaj hameshaa pehle fahraaya janaa chahie or sabase baad main utaara janaa chahie
 When the flag is placed in the shape of a multiplication symbol, the Indian flag should be placed in front and the other flags should be on the right side
 jab sanyukt raashtra kaa dhvaj bhartiya dhvaj ke saath fahraaya ja rahaa he, to use donon taraf pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Normally the flag is hoisted to the right of the direction
 jab jhanda anya jhandon ke saath fahraaya ja rahaa ho, jaise korporate jhande, vigyaapan ke binar hon to niyamanusaar anya jhande alag stambhon par hai to rashtriya jhanda bich main hona chahie, yaa prekshkon ke liye sabase bain ore hona chahie yaa anya jhandon se ek chaudai oonchi honi chahie
 The pillar of the national flag should be ahead of the other pillars, if it is in the same group, it should be at the top
 yadi jhande ko anya jhandon ke saath juluus main le jaaya ja rahaa ho to jhande ko juluus main sabase aage hona chahie, yadi ise kai jhandon ke saath le jaaya ja rahaa he to ise juluus main sabase aage hona chahie
 When the flag is displayed in a closed room, in public meetings or in conferences of any kind, it should be placed on the right side because the place is official
 jab jhanda haul yaa anya baithak main ek vaktaa ke bagal main pradarshit kiya ja rahaa ho to yah vaktaa ke daahine haath par rakhaa janaa chahie
 When it is displayed elsewhere in the hall, it should be placed to the right of the audience
 kesaria pattee ko upar rakhte hue is dhvaj ko puri tarah se failaa kar pradarshit karnaa chahie
 If the flag is hung perpendicular to the wall behind the stage, the saffron strip should be placed in front of the viewer so that the top is up
 yadi jhanda kisi juluus yaa parade main anya jhande yaa jhandon ke saath le jaaya ja rahaa he to, jhande ko juluus ke dahine ore yaa sabase aage bich main rakhana chahie
 The flag carries a specificity at the time of unveiling of a statue or monument, or plaque, but should not be used to cover an object
 sammaan ke chihn ke rup main ise kisi vyakti yaa vastu ko dhankna nahin chahie
 Platoon colors, organizational or institutional flags can be covered as a mark of respect
 kisi samaaroh main fahraate samay yaa jhande ko utaarte samay yaa jhanda kisi parade se guzar rahaa he yaa kisi samiksha ke dauraan, sabhi upasthit vyaktiyon ko dhvaj kaa saamana karnaa chahie or dhyaan se khadey hona chahie
 Those wearing uniforms should present a suitable salute
 jab jhanda stambh se guzar rahaa ho to, logon ko dhyaan se khadey hona chahie yaa salaami deni chahie
