 Because the order is only temporary, Lopez's lawyer, Jay lavalley, said they would return to court to settle it
 Lavelli insists that Noa has "nothing in it" like a sex tape, "that is private and personal, but it is not a sex tape
" ve nirdosh hai or unhen galat tareeqe se pesh kiya gaya he
 

to increase their value and attract media attention "
 After the hearing, Noa told e !, that they were planning to fight against this prohibition:" It's not about money, it's about me
 Is about life
 " Lopez then had a two-and-a-half-year relationship with hip-hop king Sean Combs
 On December 27, 1999, Lopez and Coombs were at Club New York, a Midtown Manhattan nightclub, when fire broke out between Coombs' crew and another group
 When Lopez and Coombs were being taken away from the scene, they were chased and stopped by police
 a gun was found on the front seat of his vehicle

 Banke Bihari Temple is located at Raman Reti in Vrindavan Dham in Mathura district, India
 yah bharat ke pracheen or prasiddh mandiron main se ek he
 Banke Bihari is a form of Krishna which is depicted in it
 iskaa nirmaan 1864 main swami haridas ne karavaaya tha
 Shridham Vrindavan, this is such a holy land, on which the land comes to destroy all sins
 aisa akhir koun vyakti hoga jo is pavitra bhoomi par aana nahin chahega tathaa shri bankebihari ji ke darshan kar apane ko krutharth karnaa nahin chahega
 This temple is situated in a beautiful area of sri Vrindavan Dham
 kaha jaataa he ki is mandir kaa nirmaan swami shri haridas ji ke vanshajo ke samuhik prayaas se samvath 1921 ke lagbhag kiya gaya
 At the beginning of the temple construction, no donor's money was put into it
 sriharidas swami vishay udasin vaishnav the
 Pleased with his bhajan-kirtan, Shri Bankebihariji appeared from Nidhivan
 swami haridas ji kaa janm samvath 1536 main bhadrapada mahine ke shukla paksh main ashtami ke din vrindavan ke nikat rajapur naamak gaanv main hua tha
 His worshiper was shyam-saloni Surat Bale Sribakebihari ji
 inke pita kaa naam gangadhar evam mata kaa naam shrimati chitra devi tha
 Haridas ji was a disciple of Swami Ashudhir Dev ji
 inhen dekhte hi aashudhir devji jaan gayi the ki ye sakhi lalitaji ke avatar hai tathaa radhashtami ke din bhakthi pradaayani shri radha ji ke mangal–mahotsav kaa darshan laabh hetu hi yahan padhaare he
 Haridasji is considered the incarnation of Rasnidhi Sakhi
 ye bachapan se hi sansar se oobe rahete the
 As a teenager, he took a couple's mantra initiation from Ashudhir ji and started meditating at a lonely place in Nikunj near Yamuna
 jab ye 25 varsh ke hue tab inhone apane guru ji se virakthavesh praapt kiya evam sansar se dur hokar nikunj bihari ji ke nity lilaon kaa chintan karne main rah gayi
 It was in Nikunj forest that Swami Haridasji had a dream to remove the statue of Bihariji
 tab unki aagyaanusaar manohar shyamvarn chhavi vaale shrivigrah ko dharaa ko god se baahar nikaala gaya
 This beautiful idol became famous in the world by the name of Sribakebihari ji
 This idol was removed on the fifth date of Margashirsha, Shukla
 atah prakatya tithi ko ham vihaar panchami ke rup main bade hi ullas ke saath maanate he
 Due to the combined image or integrated image of the couple Kishore Sarkar's idol Radha Krishna, there is a feeling of supernatural light between the image of Banke Bihari ji, which is the symbol of Radha element in Banke Bihari ji
 swami haridas Shri Bankebihari Ji had been serving by Swamiji for a long time in Nidhivan itself
 phir jab mandir kaa nirmaan kaary sampann ho gaya, tab unako vahaan laakar sthapit kar diya gaya
 The Sanadhaya dynasty should be able to maintain the enjoyment and other service arrangements of Shri Krishna Yati Ji, Bihari Ji
 phir inhone samvath 1975 main hargulal seth ji ko shribihari ji kii seva vyavastha sambhaalane hetu niyukt kiya
 Then this Seth established Sribakebihari Trusts at places like Verry, Kolkata, Rohtak, etc
 iske alaava anya bhakton kaa sahyog bhi isamen kaaphi sahaayta pradaan kar rahaa he
 It is a matter of joy when many Deities were transferred due to the fear of the rise of Kala Pahad
 parantu shribankevihari ji yahaan se sthaanantarit nahin hue
 Even today, he is being worshiped here with love
 kaalaantar main swami haridas ji ke upasna paddati main parivartan laakar ek naye sampradaay, nimbark sampradaay se swatantra hokar sakhibhaav sampradaay bana
 According to this method, service and festivals etc
 are celebrated in all the temples of Vrindavan
 shribankebihari ji mandir main keval sharad poornima ke din shri shribankebihari ji vanshidharan karte hai
 Only on the day of Shravan Teej, Thakur ji sits on the swing and only on the day of Janmashtami is his Mangala-aarti
 jiske darshan saubhagyashaalee vyakti ko hi praapt hote hai
 And Charan Darshan occurs only on the day of Akshaya Tritiya
 in charan-kamalon kaa jo darshan karata he uskaa to bedaa hi paar lag jaataa he
 Swami Haridas ji was a famous singer of music and a mentor of Tansen
 ek din praatavkaal swami ji dekhne lage ki unke bistar par koi razaai odhakar so rahaa hai
 Seeing this, Swamiji said - who are sleeping on my bed? vahaan shribihari ji swayan so rahe the
 On hearing the word, Bihari ran out
 kintu ve apane chuda evam vanshi, ko vistar par rakhkar chale gayi
 Swami ji, due to chronic vision in old age, he could not see anything
 iske pashchaat shri bankebihariji mandir ke pujari ne jab mandir ke kapaat khole to unhen shri bankevihariji mandir ke pujari ne jab mandir main kapat khole to unhen shribankebihari ji ke palane main chuda evam vanshi najar nahin aayi
 But the door of the temple was closed
 aashcharyachakit hokar pujari ji nidhivan main swami ji ke paas aaye evam swami ji ko sabhi baaten bataayi
 Swamiji said that someone had slept on my side in the morning
 wo jate vakt kuch chhod gaya hai
 Then the priest directly saw that Sibankebihari ji's wounds are lying on the wall
 isse pramanit hota he ki shribankebihari ji raat ko raas karne ke liye nidhivan jate hai
 For this reason, there is no mangla-aarti in the morning
 kaaran–raatri main raas karke yahaan bihari ji aate he
 Therefore, it is a crime to interrupt their sleep in the morning
 swami haridas ji ke darshan praapt karne ke liye anekon samraat yahan aate the
 Once Emperor Akbar of Delhi came here to see Swamiji
 thakur ji ke darshan praatah 9 baje se dopaher 12 baje tak evam saayam 6 baje se raatri 9 baje tak hote hai
 Changes in time are made according to the special date
 shribankebihari ji ke darshan sambandh main anekon kahaniyaan prachlit hai
 One and two of which are the following - Once a devotee persuaded her husband to go to Vrindavan after much persuasion

 Contemporary storytellers and poets of Ramesh Chandra Jha have expressed different views on them, some of which are as follows: - shri rameshchandra jha ki rachanaaon se meraa parichay “hunkaar” nami patna ke saptahik se hua
 At the Rachi Kavi Sammelan, he got the opportunity to meet and listen to his poems from his mouth
 unki rachanaaon kaa arth mere man main or gaharaaya
 shri jha ji ne jahaan tak mujhe maaloom he abhi tak geet hi likhe hai
 In these songs, he has given expression to various emotions in his mind
 apane man kii bhaawanaaon ke keval kala kaa jhina patmvar pahana kar jinase unka rup or nikhar uthe na ki chhip jaae aadhunik hindi kavy sahitya kii nai parampara he
 It requires great courage and patience
 apane prati badi eemaandaaree us parampara kaa praan he
 The heart speaks and sings art in Jhaji's songs
 satat sadhana or nirantar srijan kii prerana koi rameshchandra jha ji se le or unase hi puche ki aanevaali pidiyon kaa koi daayitv bhi he ? jha ji ne champaran kaa jo saahitiyik itihaas taiyaar kiya he, vah bade mahatv kaa kaam he
 It is also responsible
 yadi prayek jile ke adhikari vyakti aisa kaam uthaaven to samast praant kaa saahitiyik itihaas anayas taiyaar ho jaye
 main ishwar se prarthana karata hoon ki aap jo bhi kaam uthaaven vah sab tarah se safal ho
 Ramesh Chandra Jha, a fresh flower of Bihar's literary Tarunai, inhabits both beauty and beauty! The world is visible to him and he appears in his heart and causes panic in his mind
 

usne dekha, mahasoos kiya or sochaa


masti main hua to chand guunje or mastishk main hua to gadd kii ladiyaan bikhar gayi- yaheen uskaa sahitya he
 

 So without Pisces, Aries, Mithoon are those who promote the steps and the destination that they wait for
 ramesh ji ke vyaktitv or krititv se desh kaa konaa konaa bhalee-bhaanti parichit he
 

for this it would be more expedient to say that they are their own metaphors
 

hindi sahitya ko kai abhootpurv granth unhone die hai
 There is hardly any genre of literature in which Ramesh ji would not have written
 

bina kisi shor-sharabe ke unhone lagaataar likhakar sahitya-sadhana ke kshetra main ek sarvatha nayaa kirtiman sthapit kiya he
 

! nithlle baithe sochate rahane vaale na samajhen par kaviver ramesh chandra jha jaanate hai ki girdaabon se kaise batch niklaa ja saktaa he
 

 how can one sentiment be saved by the entanglement of many emotions, the glut of protest and the sound of immortal valleys
 

unhone samakaleen sahitya or uske pratinidhi rachanakaaron par itnaa adhik likhaa he ki nai peedi unhen prerana kaa akshay shrot maanati he
 

! dinakar ke saath bihar main kaviyon kii jo nayi paudh jaagi, uskaa ajeeb hasr hua
 

 Finds where are the plants that come after this
 

kabhi kabhi kuch nae ankur zamin kii moti part ko chhed kar jhaankate hue se dikhaai padate hai
 

ramesh is also a sprout
 

or vah mere ghar kaa he, apana he
 

 i love my apathy and prejudice, we go on together, but even then we cannot be left alone, the chain of motherhood cannot be broken! Partisanship would rightly say that i like Ramesh's stuff very much
 

 Dozens of books are published by Shri Ramesh Chandra Jha in almost all the Hindi genres
