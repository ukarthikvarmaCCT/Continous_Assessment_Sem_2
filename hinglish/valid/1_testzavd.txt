 yah apane samay kaa sabase jatil mishan tha jisamen ek maanav rahit yaan agena pehle choda janaa tha or titan II, jisamen armastrang or scot savaar the, se ise antariksh main joda janaa tha
 About two hours after arriving in the classroom, the two vehicles were combined, however, during this time some technical problems arose and Armstrong's decision to deal with the problem was criticized
 baad main ne likhaa ki chaalak dal ne vaisaa hi kiya jaisaa ki unhen prashikshan diya gaya tha, unhone galati kii kyonki hamane unhen galat prashikshan diya tha
 The planners of the campaign did not think that the basic thing was that when two vehicles would join each other, they would have to follow it as one vehicle
 armastrang khud bhi is kaaran kaafii avsaadagrast huye kyonki abhiyaan kii avadhi ko chota kar diya gaya or iske zyaadaatar lakshyon ko nirast kar diya gaya
 Armstrong's last role in the Gemini program was the backup-command pilot of Gemini 11
 isaki ghoshnaa gemini 8 ke prithvi par waapas lautne ke do din baad hi kar di gayi thi
 Armstrong was later in the role of a teacher largely due to his experience of two successful campaigns
 12 sitambar 1966 ko ise launch kiya gaya, peet conrad or dick gordon is yaan main savaar the or armastrang ne capsule communicator ke rup main apni bhoomika adaa kii
 This campaign was fully successful in achieving its stated goals

 In another tour, Armstrong, Dick's Garden and George Low, the trio traveled to 14 major cities in 11 countries
 armastrang ne apollo 8 abhiyaan main kaary kiya tha or iske pashchaat unhen apollo 11 kaa commander banaaye jane kaa prastaav 23 disambar 1968 ko mila
 According to the plan, Armstrong was to perform the responsibility of commander, the lunar module to Pilot Buzz Aldrin, and the command module to Pilot Michael Collins
 march 1969 main hui ek meeting main yah nirnay liya gaya ki armastrang chaand par utarane vaale pehle vyakti honge
 There was also some role in the decision that NASA management believed that Armstrong was a man of humble nature
 14 april 1969 ko ek press conference main yah bataaya gaya ki lunar modul kaa dizin aisa tha ki iskaa darwaja andar daahine kii ore khulanaa tha or is kaaran daahine baithe pilot ko pehle utarana mushkil tha
 It was also stated that according to protocol, Armstrong, who was the commander of the expedition, should be given the opportunity to land first
 apollo 11 ke launch ke dauraan armastrang kii hridaygati 110 spandan prati minute tak pahunch gayi thi
 Armstrong found its first stage to be the most noisy, far more than their previous Gemini 8 Titan II launch
 apollo kaa cmand modul avashya hi gemini kii tulana main adhik sthaan vaala tha
 Perhaps this was also the reason that its passengers did not have to face space sickness due to more space
 apollo 11 kaa lakshya kisi vishisht sthaan par sateekta ke saath utarana nahin balki surakshit utarana tha
 After three minutes of time while landing on the moon, Armstrong realized that his speed was a few seconds higher than planned, and the eagle would probably descend several miles from the chosen spot according to plan
 jab eagle ke landing radar ne sataha ke aankadon ko praapt kiya kuch computer truti chetavaniyaan bhi saamne aayin
 The first warning error came in the form of 1202, and despite his extensive training no one knew Aldrin or Armstrong what it meant
 unhen turant hi capsule communicator charles duk se sandesh mila ki ye truti chetavaniyaan chintaa kaa vishay nahin hai or ve computer overflo ke kaaran hai
 When Armstrong targeted that they were going out of the safe landing area, he took control of the Lunar module in his hands and attempted to find a place to land it safely
 is kaary main kuch adhik samay lagane kii sambhaavna thi or yah chintaa kaa vishay bhi tha kyonki isse lunar modul ke eendhan chuk jane kii ashanka thi
 After landing, Aldrin and Armstrong felt that they had 40 seconds of fuel, including 20 seconds of fuel, which was to be saved in the event of the mission being canceled
 mishan kii samaapti ke baad ke vishleshanon main paaya gaya ki takreeban 45 se 50 second ke nodan hetu eendhan shesh bachaa tha
 Landing on the moon's surface occurred a few seconds after 20:17:40 UTC, on July 20, 1969, when one of the three long probes connected to three of the four legs of the lunar module came into contact with the lunar surface and the module
 The indicator light inside lit up and Aldrin announced "contact Light"
 armastrang ne ingine band karne kaa nirdesh diya or kuch secondon ke landig pranali kii jaanch ke uparaant armastrang ne ghoshnaa kii, "houston, tranquility base hiyar

 a few seconds later, the Duke confirmed receiving the message from the ground contact

 Once Aldrin and Armstrong were ready to go out, the eagle was released and the door was opened

 Shortly after, President Nixon spoke to these astronomers by telephone from his office

 After installing the scientific test package, Armstrong went there in a stroll, now called the eastern crater, about 65 yards east of the Lunar module

 In an interview in 2010, Armstrong stated that NASA kept the period to just two and a half hours because those people were skeptical about how spacesuits would behave in the moon's extremely hot surroundings
 jab armastrang or elderin lunar modul main waapas laute, darwaja band or sil kiya gaya
 While preparing to rise to reach the command module Columbia, he found that the switch to turn on his engine was broken

 The area mentioned by the name of Manas Khand in the Manas Khand and other mythological literature of Skanda Purana is the present Kumaon Mandal
 is kshetra main bhi anek pracheen mandir or tirth sthal hai
 Several dialects are spoken in the Kumaon region
 kuch mukhya sthaneey bhashaaain is prakaar hai:- Various opinions have been prevalent regarding the derivation of the word Kumaon
 bhashaa kii drushti se yahi uchit jaan padataa he ki yah shabd multah sanskrit main kurm he
 There is a 2196 meter high Kanteshwar mountain near Champawat in respect of which Lord Vishnu in his second incarnation stayed on this mountain for three years
 tab se vah parvat kanteshwar ke sthaan par kurm-anchal naam se janaa jane laga
 The shape of this mountain also looks like the back of a tortoise
 sambhavtah isi kaaran is kshetra kaa naam kurmanchal padaa hoga
 At first the word Kurma may have come into use, because the word Kurm is found in abundance in the local language
 kurm ke sthaan par kumuun shabd nishpann hone kaa ek kaaran yah bhi ho saktaa he ki yahan kii boliyon main ukaarantata adhik pai jaati he
 Later, in the literary texts, copper letters, the word Kuma was replaced by Kumaon and then the word Kumaon was accepted
 sanskrit granthon main bhi kurmanchal shabd kaa prayog miltaa he
 In the absence of authentic historical facts, it is difficult to say with certainty which human castes were originally dominated in the Kumaon region
 mahabharat, puraana or pracheen sanskrit sahitya main uplabdh katipay sandarbhon se gyaat hota he ki yahan kiraat, kinnar, yaksha, tangav, kulind, khas ityadi jatiyaan nivas karti thim
 In the forest festival of Mahabharata, the castes residing in the uplands of the central Himalayas have been described as Kirat, Tangava and Kulint
 kiraantathanganakeern kulind shat sankulam
 Enumerating the names of those present in Yudhishthira's rajasuya-yajna, Duryodhana states that the mountain king named khas-ekasan, Parada, Kulind, Tangava and Paratangana, residing on the banks of the Shailoksha river in the middle of the Meru temple mountains, is a black chambar and gold of Pipilika caste

 The Brahmapurana and the Vayupurana provide signs of the existence of castes like Kirat, Kinnar, Yaksha, Gandharva, Vidyadhar, Nag, etc
 in the central Himalayas

 There is a famous temple of Binag / Beninag in a place called Berinag in Pithoragarh district
 naagon ke naam par kumaanun main or bhi kai mandir he
 Such as Dhaulnag, Kalinag, Pingalnag, Kharhrynag, Basuki Nag, Nagdev etc

 It is also likely that the Munda-speaking Kirat caste of the Agni family dominated the region for a long time, otherwise it would not have been known as Kiratamandal in ancient times
 apane swatantra bhashaai astitv ke saath kiraaton ke vanshaj aaj bhi kumaun ke askot evam didihat naamak sthanon main maujuud hai
 In Kumaon dialects, many such words are still prevalent, which seem to be the remnants of the prehistoric dialects, such as Dhud, Lydun, Jung, Jhungar, Phang, Thanghar, Ganga, Lyat etc
 In addition to vocabulary, certain grammatical elements are also ignorant
 The languages of the family are similar, such as kumuni karma causative indicator kani / kan suffixes of Munda's Bhoveasi and Kork earrings have k / kin or khe / khin

 New light spread over the establishment of Chandravanshi rule
 ‘ When the power of the last kings of the Katyuri dynasty weakened, small states became independent, and they united and expanded their kingdom
 sampoorn kumaun main koi ek shakti na thi, jo sabko apane adheen kar paati
 During this Sankranti period, the kingdom was shattered and the development works started by the Katyuri kings either ended or their form changed
 katyur vansh ke antim shaskaon ne praja par atyadhik atyaachaar bhi kiye
 In the same tradition, even during this Sankranti period, the local small kings also persecuted the people very much, but the shana-shanai Chandravanshi kings laid the foundation of their unbroken kingdom
 kuch itihaaskaar chandravanshi shashan kaal kaa prarambh 1261 i

 According to Badridatta Pandey, the first king of the Chandravansh, Somchand sat on the throne around 700 AD
 chandravanshi raajaaon ke kumaun main aane kaa kaaran bhi spasht nahin he
 According to scholars, after the end of Katyuri rule, the people, saddened by the atrocities of the native kings, went to King Somchand of Kannauj and invited him to establish peace in Kumaon

 Thus the Chandravansha was established in Kumaon

 By the time of King Mahendra Chand, the Chand kings had full authority over the entire Kumaon

 At the same time, many Brahmin castes from Kannauj etc
 came to settle in Kumaon and along with them untouchability, differences in food, varna tradition and differences of caste gotra related to marriage also became prevalent among the original inhabitants, which is still in Kumaon today

 There was never Muslim rule in Kumaon, but the study of books like 'jahangirnama' and 'shahnama' showed that the Mughal court had direct connection with the Chand kings
