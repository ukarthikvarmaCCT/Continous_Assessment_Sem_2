 newton ke gati niyam teen bhautik niyam hai jo chirsmmat yantriki ke aadhaar hai
 These rules describe the relationship between the force exerted on an object and the speed of that object
 inhen teen sadiyon main anek prakaar se vyakt kiya gaya he
 Newton's three laws of motion, traditionally, are summarized as follows: sabase pehle newton ne inhe apane granth philasphi nechuralis principia mathematica main sankalit kiya tha
 Newton used them to explain the problems related to the motion of physical objects in many places
 apane granth ke tritiy bhaag main newton ne darshaya ki gati ke ye teenon niyam or unke saarvatrik gurutvkarshan kaa niyam sammilit rup se kepler ke akashiya pindon kii gati se sambandhit niyam kii vyakhya karne main samarth hai
 Newton's law of motion is applied only to those objects which we can consider as a particle
 matlab ki un vastuon kii gati ko napate samay unke aakar ko nazarandaz kiya jaataa he
 These rules are applied by considering the objects of those objects centered in a single point
 aisa tab kiya jaataa he jab vishleshan main dooriyaan vastuyon kii tulana main kaaphi bade hote he
 Therefore, the planets can be measured as a particle and their orbital speed can be measured
 apane mul rup main in gati ke niyamo ko drudh or virupanshil pindon par nahin lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In 1750, Leonard Euler expanded Newton's speed rules and created Euler's speed rules that could also be applied to rigid and deformable bodies
 yadi ek vastu ko asatat kanon kaa ek sangyojan mana jaye, jiname alag-alag kar ke newton ke gati niyam lagaaye ja sakate he, to ular ke gati niyam ko newton ke gati niyam se viyuttpann kiya ja saktaa he
 Newton's laws of motion also apply in some direction systems, called inertial direction systems
 kai lekhako kaa maananaa he ki pratham niyam jadtviya nirdesh tantra ko paribhaashit karata he or dwitiya niyam sirf unhi nirdesh tantron se main maanya he isi kaaran se pehle niyam ko dusre niyam kaa ek vishesh rup nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 But some consider the first rule to be the result of the second
 nirdesh tantron kii spasht avadharana newton ke marane ke kaaphi samay pashchaat viksit hui
 Newtonian mechanics has now been replaced by Einstein's theory of special relativity, but it is still used for objects at a speed less than the speed of light
 newton ke mul shabdon main Hindi translation "prayek vastu apane sthiravastha athwa ekasmaan vegavastha me tab tak rahati he jab tak use kisi bahya kaarak dwaara avasthaa main badlaav ke liye prerit nahin kiya jaataa
 " duusare shabdon main, jo vastu viraam avasthaa main he vah viraam avasthaa main hi rahegi tathaa jo vastu gatiman hai vah gatiman hi rahegi jab tak ki us par bhi koi bahari bal naa lagaaya jaae
 Newton's first law defines inertia, a natural property of matter that opposes changes in momentum
 isliye pratham niyam ko jadtv kaa niyam bhi kehete he
 This rule also indirectly defines the inertial reference system and force
 iske kaaran newton dwaara is niyam ko pratham rakhaa gaya
 Simple authentication of this rule is difficult because the bodies feel the effects of friction and gravity
 asal main newton se pehle galileo ne is prekshan kaa varnan kiya
 Newton expressed it in other words
 newton ke mul shabdo main : Translation in hindi " kisi vastu ke samveg me aayaa badlaav us vastu par aropit dhakke ke samaanupati hota he tathaa samaan disha main ghatit hota he
 "the following points can be arranged by Newton's law: jahaan f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} bal, p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} samveg or t { \ displaystyle t} samay hai
 According to this equation, when there is no external force on a body, the momentum of the body remains constant
 jab pind kaa dravyaman sthir hota he, to sameekaran zyaada saral rup main likhaa ja saktaa he: Where m { \ displaystyle m} is mass and a → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {a}}} is acceleration
 yani kisi pind kaa twaran aropit bal ke anukramanupati he
 The impulse relates to the Second Rule
 aaveg kaa matlab he samveg main parivartan
 meaning: jahaan i aaveg he
 Very important in the analysis of impulse collisions
 mana ki kisi pind kaa dravyaman m he
 Applying a rule force f to this for ान्तt time period, the velocity changes to ∆v
 tab newton- Therefore, the impulse given to a body is similar to the change in momentum produced in the body
 at: aaveg kaa maatrak vahi hota he jo samveg kaa he
 The third law means that there is another force corresponding to a force that is equal and opposite to it
 newton ne is niyam ko istemaal karke samveg sangrakshan ke niyam kaa varnan kiya, lekin asal main samveg sangrakshan ek adhik moolbhoot siddhant he
 There are many examples in which momentum is preserved but the third rule is not valid

 nuqta devanagari, gurmukhi or anya brahmi parivaar kii lipiyon main kisi vyanjan akshar ke neeche lagaae jane vaale bindu ko kehete hai
 With this, the pronunciation of that letter is changed to another consonant
 masalan 'ja' ke neeche nukta lagane se 'za' ban jaataa he or 'da' ke neeche nukta lagane se 'd' ban jaataa he
 Nukte is used to make dishes that are not already in the original script, as 'dh' was not in the original Devanagari alphabet nor is it found in Sanskrit
 arabi-farsi lipi main bhi aksharon main nuchhaton kaa prayog hota he, udaahranarth 'ر ' kaa uccharan 'r' he jabaki isi akshar main nuqta lagaakar 'ز ' likhane se iskaa uccharan 'za' ho jaataa he
 In these languages, both the words z and z are available and used, besides n there is another z for which the following words are used: z for z, zwad for z / z / zal / zoe - these four There are letters
 yahaan dhyaan yogya ye he ki chaar akshar za ke liye hone ke baavjood ja ke liye jim hota hi he
 Hence, jim is also used, as both h and z are used in the passion
 aise hi bahut sthanon par ga ke liye gaaf evam ga ke liye gin kaa bhi prayog hota he
 Originally, 'nukta' is an Arabic word and means 'point'
 saadhaaran hindi-urdu main iskaa arth 'bindu' hi hota he
 The following letters are used in Hindi for slang letters and their contiguous forms
 unke hantarian lipyantaran or anterrashtriya dhvanyatmak varnmaala chihn bhi die gaye hai

 chitrasheershak2]] Nukta has been the subject of discussion among Hindi scholars for a long time
 kishoridas vaajapeyi jaise vyakaran ke vidwaan hindi lekhan main nukta lagane ke paksh main nahin hai
 They say that all these words have now become their own in Hindi and Hindi speakers pronounce these words as if they have not been pointed out
 bahut kam logon ko urdu ke nukte vaale sahi uccharan kaa gyaan he
 According to the standard Hindi spelling issued by the Central Hindi Directorate, arabic-persian-origin words that have become a part of Hindi and whose foreign sounds have been converted into Hindi sounds can be accepted in Hindi only
 jaise :– kalam, kila, daag aadi 
 But where their pure use in foreign form is desired or it is necessary to state the accent, there should be in-place nukes in their prevalent forms in Hindi
 jaise :– khaanaa : kaanaa, raaj : raaj, fan : hifan aadi

 This was the first time Pashtuns were ruled by a non-muslim
 uske baad unhone peshawar, jammu kashmir or anandpur par bhi adhikaar kar liya
 He is also credited with forming the first modern Indian Army - the "sikh Khalsa Army"
 unki saraparasti main punjab ab bahut shaktishaalee suba tha
 This powerful army kept Britain from grabbing Punjab for a long time
 ek aisa mauka bhi aayaa jab punjab hi ekmaatr aisa suba tha, jis par angrejon kaa kabja nahin tha
 According to British historian JT Wheeler, if he had been a generation older, he would have conquered the whole of India
 maharaja ranjit khud anpadh the, lekin unhone apane rajya main shiksha or kala ko bahut protsaahan diya
 He established law and order in Punjab and never gave death penalty to anyone

 Never forced anyone to adopt Sikhism
 unhone amritsar ke harimandir sahib gurudware main sangemarmar lagavaaya or sona madhvaaya, tabhi se use swarna mandir kaha jane laga

 His mausoleum was built in Lahore, which still remains there
 unki maut ke saath hi angrejon kaa punjab par shikanja kasnaa shuru ho gaya

 He was a visionary
 ve saanwale rang kaa nate kad ke manushya the
 One of his eyes was lost due to Sheetla's wrath
 parantu yah hote hue bhi vah tejasvi the
 So as long as he was alive, all the missiles were buried
 us samay angrejon kaa rajya yamuna tak pahunch gaya tha or phulakiyaan misl ke raja angreji rajya ke prabhutv ko maanane lage the
 The British forbade Ranjitsingh from doing this
 ranjitsingh ne angrejon se ladanaa uchit na samajha or sandhi kar lee ki satluj ke aage ham apana rajya na badhayenge
 Ranjitsingh summoned the French troops, prepared his army in a military manner, in his military command
 ab unne punjab ke dakshini, pashchimi or uttari bhaagon par akraman karnaa prarambh kiya or das varsh main multan, peshawar or kashmir tak apane rajya ko badha liya
 Ranjitsinh had captured Peshawar in his possession, but he had to fight hard for many years to take full authority over that province
 vah puure punjab kaa swami ban chukaa; or use angrejon ke hastkshep kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa

 ranjitsingh ne san 1808 i
 main apni mahatvakankshini saas sadakor ke naam peshawar kaa rajya parivartit kar diya tha
 Because it was a British agent woman
 ranjitsingh ne apni kuchakrapriy saas se jhagada karke use kaid kar liya tha or hvadani ke garh ko apane adhikaar main kar liya tha
 a contingent of the British army rescued the captive widow Sadakaur and recovered the authority
 british sena ke saath ranjitsingh kisi prakaar kaa jhagada nahin chaahate the
 The British could be accused of breaching the terms of the treaty
 isliye chupchaap maun rahakar usne taiyaariyaan prarambh kii thim phir bhi 1809 i
 main lard minto se sandhi kar lee
 However, this treaty caused the Maharaja to be greatly humiliated among the Sikhs
 uparyukt sandhi ke kaaran punjab ke afgani rajya tathaa afghanistan ko kuch had tak aantkit kar sake the
 In 1802, 1806 and 1810 AD, conquered Multan and took possession and made a treaty with Shah Shuja and kept it there and obtained a 'cohenoor diamond' for a glass of water from it

 Fearing Ranjitsingh's authority over Peshawar in 1838, Dost Mohammad Khan Kabulnaresh became very frightened and befriended Russia and Iran
 is baat ko dhyaan main rakhkar angrejon ne swayan ranjitsingh tathaa shahshuja ke saath ek trigutsandhi karai
 Maharaja Ranjitsingh was becoming unwell

 Punjab was ruled by Maharaja Ranjit Singh
 us samay maharaja ranjit singh ne kashmir ke soobedaar atamohammad ke shikanje se kashmir ko mukt karaane kaa abhiyaan shuru kiya tha

 Zaman Shah was the son of Ahmad Shah Abdali's son Timur Shah, whose brother was Mahmud Shah
 astu, maharaja ranjaiti singh swayan chaahate the ki ve kashmir ko atamohammad se mukt karavaaen
 Therefore, upon coming to Suyog, Maharaja Ranjit Singh liberated Kashmir
 unke dewan mohakamchand ne shergarh ke kile ko gher kar vafa begum ke pati shahshuja ko reeha kar vafa begum ke paas lahore pahunchaa diya
 Rajkumar Kharagsingh accommodated them in Mubarak Haveli
 par vafa begum apane vaade ke anusaar kohinoor hira maharaja ranjit singh ko bhent karne main vilamb karti rahi
 Even several months passed
 jab maharaja ne shahshuja se kohinoor heere ke bare main poocha to vah or uski begum donon hi bahaane banane lage
 When more emphasis was given, he handed over a fake diamond to Maharaja Ranjit Singh, which proved to be a fake test of jewelers
 ranjit singh krodh se bhar uthe or mubarak haveli gher lee gai
 Food was not served there for two days
 varsh 1813 kii pehali june thi jab maharaja ranjit singh shahshuja ke paas aae or phir kohinoor ke vishay main poocha
 Shattered Shahshuja hid Kohinoor in his turban
 kisi tarah maharaja ko iskaa pataa chal gaya
 Hence, he pledged to put Shahshuja on the throne of Kabul by placing his hand on "gurugranth Sahib"
 phir use "pagadi-badal bhai" banane ke liye usase pagadi badal kar kohinoor praapt kar liya
 Wafa Begum, sitting in the curtain of the curtain, understood the prudence of the Maharaja
 ab kohinoor maharaja ranjit singh ke paas pahunch gaya tha or ve santusht the ki unhone kashmir ko aaazaad kara liya tha
 He wished to offer the Kohinoor diamond to the iconic Lord Jagannath in the temple of Jagannathpuri
 hindu mandiron ko manon sona bhent karne ke liye ve prasiddh the
 He also offered immense gold at the Vishwanath temple in Kashi
 parantu jagannatha bhagwaan tak pahunchane kii unki ichha koshadhyaksh beliram kii kuniti ke kaaran puri na ho saki
 After the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the British attacked the Sikhs in 1845
 ferozepur kshetra main sikh sena veertapurvak angrejon kaa muqabla kar rahi thi
 But the commander of the Sikh army, Lalsingh, betrayed and left the front and fled to Lahore
 is kaaran vijay ke nikat pahunchakar bhi sikh sena haar gai
 The British took the Kohinoor diamond from the Sikhs
 saath hi kashmir or hajaaraa bhi sikhon se chin liye kyonki angrejon ne dedh karod rupye kaa jurmaana sikhon par kiya tha, arthabhaav-grast sikh kisi tarah keval 50 lakh rupye hi de paae the
 Lord Harding brought the Kohinoor diamond to London to please Queen Victoria of England, which was handed over to Queen Victoria by the "east India Company"

 His former supervisor, Bryant, tells him that many replicants - biologically made manned machines that served as soldiers and slaves in colonies outside the world - have escaped and temporarily gone to Earth
 ek "blade ranor" ke rup main jab sakriy tha, tab decard kaa kaam aise replicants ko prithvi main khoj nikaalkar unhen "ritair" karnaa tha
 Bryant shows him a video of another Blade Runner Holden, who performs a White Camph test, which reveals the separation of humans from replicants based on similar answers to questions
 jab pareekshan ke paatr leon ko aisa lagata he ki ek replicant ke rup main uski pole khul sakati he, to vah holden ko goli maar detaa he
 After Bryant's threat, Deckard agrees to find Leon and three other replicants - Roy Batty, Zohra and Priss -
 in replicants - tyrel korporation nexs-6 model -kii jivan-avadhi chaar varsh kii he, suraksha kii drushti se aisa kiya gaya taaki unamem bhaawanaaon ke vikaas or swatantraaa kii ichha ke vikaas ko roka ja sake

 Deckard is sent to Tyrell Corporation along with Gaff to ensure that the voight-kampf test works on the Nexus-6 model
 jabaki vahaan, decard ko pataa chalata he ki tyrel kii sahaayak richel ek prayogtmak replicant he jo khud ko maanav samajhati he; tyrel kii bhatiji kii bachapan kii yaadon se rashel kii chetana bad gayi he
 As a result, a more comprehensive white-kampf test is necessary to identify him as a replicant

 patrachaar shatranj ke khel main, jo ve khel rahe the, tyrel ko ek vijayi chaal ke bare main sebastian dwaara suchit karne ke bahaane roy or sebastian tyrel ke paintahouse main pravesh karte hai
 Roy demands an extension of his life span from his producer
 tyrel bataata hai ki tyrel korporation ke paas is kaam ko karne kaa kabhi bhi koi upaay nahin rahaa
 roy apane paapon ke liye kshamaadaan chahta he, vah kabool karata he ki usne "aapattijanak kaam" kiya he
 Tyrell praises Roy's advanced design and his achievements, dismissing Roy's crime
 vah roy se "apane samay main aamod-pramod karne" ko kahata he, jis par roy tippanee karata he "aisa kuch nahinhai, jiske jaivayantriki ke bhagwaan swarg main tumhen nahin jane denge"
 uske baad roy tyrel kaa sir apane haathon se pakadakar use chuumata he or uski htya kar daalata he
 Sebastian runs towards the elevator, Roy follows him
 roy akele hi elieater se neeche utarataa he or sebastian phir nahin dekha jaataa
 Deckard arrives at Sebastian's apartment and Priss attacks him
 roy ke waapas aane ke pehle hi vah use ritair kar detaa he
 Roy punches Deckard's right hand with a wall and breaks his two fingers in retaliation to Zohra and Priss
 roy decard ko chhod detaa he or use bhaagane ke liye samay detaa he, phir vah bradbari bhawan main uski khoj karne lagata he
 The symptoms of Roy's limited life span begin to worsen and his right hand begins to swing; He bites his nails to maintain control over it
 roy decard ko chat par jane ke liye baadhya karata he
 In an attempt to escape from Roy, Deckard jumps on another building, but is not completely successful, and Kai hangs on the ground beam from the rain
 decard kii pakad dhili padane lagati he, tab roy bhi bina prayaas ke waisi hi chalaang lagaataa he, uski baanh pakad letaa he or use chat par waapas khinch letaa he
 When Roy's life is coming to an end, he makes a personal speech on his life
 "I have seen things that you people will not believe; i have seen ships attacking fire from the shoulder of the deer constellation; of the Tonhauser Gate
" C-beams have seen glow in the near darkness
 wo sabhi kshan samay main kho jaaenge; jaise ki aansu kho jate hai barish main
 ab mrityu kaa samay aa gaya
 " tabhi gaff aata he or decard ko bhala-bura kahata he
 "it's too bad that she won't live; but who wins anyway?" Deckard returns to his home and finds Rachel alive
 jab ve jane lagate hai to decard ko ek kagaz kaa unicorn miltaa he, jo gaff dwaara choda gaya colling card he
 At the end of the film, Deckard and Rachel leave the house for an uncertain future or pass through an ideal pastoral landscape, depending on the version
 haalanki blade ranor jahiraa taur par ek ection film he, yah anek naatakeey or vivarnaatmak staron par parichaalit hoti he; iske liye film noir chalan ko shrey jaataa he: femme fatale, samarthak-kathan, andhkarpurn or dhundhlee cinematography or nayak kaa shankaaspad naitik drushtikon - is maamle main, apni khud kii maanavtaa kii prakruti par chintan ko shaamil karne kaa vistaar
 It is a literate science fiction story film, thematically exposing the philosophical implications of human mastery over the philosophy of religion and genetic engineering in the context of classical Greek drama and arrogance, and biblical analogies such as the flood of Noah
 Illustrates literary sources such as Frankenstein
 bhashaa-vigyaan kii drushti se, 1851 ke prasiddh shaashvat khel par aadhaarit roy or tyrel ke bich kaa shatranj kaa khel sookshm rup se nashvarata ke vishay kaa duharaav he, haalanki scot ke anusaar yah ek sanyog bhar he
 Blade Runner does extensive research by reaching out to the past to explore the effects of technology on the environment and society, using literature, religious symbolism, classical dramatic content and film noir
 ateet, vartmaan or bhavishya ke bich yah tanaav blade ranor ke retrophitted bhavishya main pratibimbit hota he, jo ki hai-tech he or kai sthanon main chamakdaar he, lekin baaqi jagah kharaab or purana lagata he
 Journalist Lynn Barber, interviewing Ridley Scott in 2002, described the film The Observer as: "a much darker, both literally and figuratively, a strangely masochistic experience
" Director Scott said that he "liked the idea of finding pain" as a result of his brother's death from skin cancer
 "when he was ill, i would go to London and meet him and it was really painful for me
 " a halo of paranoia envelops the film
 korporate satta haaavee hoti jaati he, police maano sarvyaapee ho gayi ho, gaadiyaan or chetavanee kii roshni imaaraton kii jaanch main lagi hai or nattejey main vyakti par vishaal biomedical shakti ke chaa jane kaa pataa lagaaya jaataa he—vishesh rup se unki programing ke kaaran replicants ke parinaamon ko lekar

 yah damankaaree prishthbhumi prithvi se pare upniveshon main maanav ke nirantar pravaasana ke sandarbh kii vyakhya karti he
 The mayhem or terror state themes discovered in Blade Runner are early examples of cyber crime concepts that were expanded upon in the film
 ankhon ke punaravarti abhipraay hai, kyonki ve chhaviyon ke saath herpher karti hai, vaastaviktaa par or ise sahi-sahi anubhav karne or yaad karne kii hamaari kshamta prashn khadey karti hai
 These thematic elements provide an atmosphere of uncertainty for Blade Runner's central theme of humanity's investigation
 replicants ko khojane ke liye, ek sahanubhuti pareekshan kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, iske anek prashn pashuon ke ilaaj par kendrit hai, isse aisa lagata he maano kisi kii "maanavtaa" kaa yah ek anivaary suchak he
 Replicants near human character lack empathy, while replicants are seen showing compassion and concern for each other, and at the same time the human crowd on the streets is emotionless and impersonal
 decard maanav he bhi yaa nahin, film main yahaan tak andeh vyakt kiya gaya he ki decard maanav he bhi yaa nahin or film darshakon ko punarmoolyankan karne ko baadhya karti he ki maanav kaa arth bhala kya he
 From the time of the film's release, the question has been raised whether Deckard had to show a human or a replicant
 Both Michael delay and Harrison Ford wanted to humanize Deckard, while Hampton Fancher preferred to keep ambiguity
 ridley scot ne pushti kii he ki uski drushti main decard ek riplicant he
 The coincidence of Deckard's unicorn dream of being put in the director's cut by Gaff leaving the paper unicorn rupee gift is seen by many as Deckard being a replicant and Gaff's access to his implanted memories
 decard ek riplicant he, is vyakhya ko duusare logon dwaara chunauti di gayi, jo log yah maanate hai ki vah paatr chaahe maanav ho yaa riplicant, unicorn kaa alankaar yah bataata he ki vah bhi vaisaa hi sapana dekh saktaa he or unki atmiyata kii pahchaan kar saktaa he, yaa phir film ke mukhya vishay ke nirnaayak uttar kii anupasthiti mahatvapurn he
 Due to the ambiguity and uncertainty inherent in the film, as well as its richness of the book, the audience saw it from their own perspective
 upanyaas se fanchar ke vichlan, film kii shooting se pehle or shooting ke dauraan anek punarlekhan or is upanyaas par film ke aadhaarit hone ke baavjood ridley scot dwaara puure upanyaas ko na padhe jane ke kaaran film isaki mul prerana se kaaphi bhinn bani

 Philip K
 Dick turned down Blade Runner's $ 400,000 offer of the novelization of the script, stating that: "poor sublimation would be liked by a twelve-year-old viewer" and "would have been artfully disastrous for me
" He said, "he was enraged at my request to bring the original novel and not to undertake novelization
 aakhirkaar unhone mana ki upanyaas ke punah prakashit karne ke vaid kaaran hai, bhale hi isamen paise kharch hote hon

 According to Dick, director Martin Scorsese was interested in filming the novel, but he never chose it
 Producer Herb Jaffe chose it in the early 1970s, but Dick was not impressed by the screenplay: "robert Jaffe, who wrote the screenplay, came here to Orange County
" maine usase kaha ki yah itnaa bura he ki main yah jaananaa chahta hum ki vah mujhase yaheen pitnaa chahta he yaa mere ghar jaakar
" hampton fanchar dwaara likhi gayi patakatha 1977 main chun lee gayi

 When Dick wrote an article criticizing the early version of Hampton Fancher's script for the Los Angeles Select TV Guide, the studio sent him a rewrite of David Peoples
 Although Dick died before the film's release, he was happy with the rewriting of the screenplay, in addition to being satisfied when invited to the studio to show him twenty minutes of special effects
 screening ke baad dick ne utsahit hokar ridley scot se kaha tha ki film thik waisi hi dikh rahi he jaisaa ki unhone isaki kalpana kii thi
 The movie was dedicated to Dick

 The selection of actors for the film proved troublesome, especially for Deckard's lead role
 Screenwriter Hampton Fancher envisioned Robert Mitchum as Deckard and wrote the character's dialogues with Mitchum in mind

 However, there are some possible exceptions to the law of demand, such as Giffen items and Weblane items
 maang kaa kaanoon ganitiya abhivyakti ke tahat, kisi nirdhaarit vastu ke daam evam uski maatra ke vipareet sambandh ko pradarshit karata he, jis prakaar se ; q {x} = f (P {x}; Partial P_ {x} <0,} uparokt sameekaran darshata he ki, jab vastu kii maang eks-aksh par hoti he or keemat vaai-aksh par, donon k badhane yaa ghatane se maang vakr banataa he jise demand shedul bhi kaha jaataa he
 The downward nature of a general demand curve reflects the inverse relationship between nature, quantity demanded and price
 isliye, neeche kii ore dhalaan maang vakr maang ke kanoon ko darshata he
 Note that "demand" and "quantity demanded" are used in economic lexicon to mean different things
 ek taraf, "maang" puri maang vakr ko sanderbhit karata he, jo maatra kii maang or keemat ke bich ke sambandh he
 The change in demand is graphically represented by a change in the demand curve
 duusari ore, "maang kii gai maatra" upabhoktaaon kii maatra ko sanderbhit karne ke liye di gai keemat, duusare nirdharakon ke liye sashart chaahate hai
 The "change in quantity demand" is graphically represented by a movement along the demand curve
 aam taur par vastu kii maang tab babbti he jab us vastu ke keemat main girav aata he or thik iske vipareet mulya main badhotaree ke saath vastu kii maang kii gai raashi gir jaati he
 In some cases, however, this may not be true
 There are some items that do not follow this law
 inamen or gifen maal shaamil hai iske alaava apwaad or vivaran neeche die gaye anubhaagon main die gaye hai
 Initially proposed by Sir 'robert Giffen', economists disagreed over the existence of Giffen goods in the market
 ek giffen vastu ek neech vastu kaa varnan karti he ki jisaki keemat badhane se, utpaada badhane kii maang hoti he
 For example, during the Irish Batata famine of the 19th century, potatoes were considered a Giffen item
 Potatoes were the largest staple in the Irish diet, so income increases had a large impact on price
 logon ne maance or subjiyon jaise vilasita ke saamaan kaatane se jawaab diya or badale main adhik aalu kharida
 Therefore, as the price of potatoes increased, so did the quantity demanded
 yadi kisi vastu kii keemat main vruddhi, ek vastu kii keemat main or badhotaree kii ummid karne kaa kaaran banati he, to ve vartmaan main badi hui keemat par bhi adhik se adhik vastu khareednaa shuru kar sakate hai
 Similarly, if the price of a commodity is expected to decrease, it can postpone its purchase
 is prakaar, kuch tark karte hai ki aise maamalon main maang kaa kanoon ulanghan kiya jaataa he
 In this case, the demand curve does not slope down from left to right; This in turn presents a backward slope from top to bottom as it is known as an extraordinary demand curve
 jin saamaanon ko logon kii keemat kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, unke liye buniyadi yaa aavashyak vasteen kitni hi zaruri hai beemaa dwaara cover dawaaen ek acha udhaaharan hai
 The increase or decrease in the price of such good value does not demand its quantity
 in vastuon kaa puri tarah se sambandh nahin he, kyonki keemat main koi bhi badlaav maang kii gai maatra main nahin badalata he

 is prakaar hue phaayde-nuksaan ko niveshko me baant diya jaataa he
 Mutual funds are an accessible route for those who wish to invest even if there is not enough knowledge of the stock market

 He is the investor who maintains the investment
 ek doosraa laabh ye bhi hota he, ki chote niveshak bahut kam raashi jaise 100 ru

 Investors can choose the plan that best fits the investment objectives and goals
 jo niveshak kisi vishesh share ke liye kol nahin chaahate ve suchakank aadhaarit yojana yani index skim main nivesh kar sakate hai kyonki index skim un vishesh sheyaron main hi nivesh karti he jo kisi vishesh index kaa hissaa hote hai

 Close ended funds cannot issue any new units under the scheme except bonus or right issue
 is hi kaaran se open anded yojana kii unit puunji main share kii hi tarah utaar chadhaav ho sakate hai, jabaki close anded ke maamle main aisa nahin hota
 An open-ended scheme can be entered or exited at any time and sometimes has a lock-in period, which cannot contain redemption, so it should be fixed at the time of admission
 close anded yojana main sabsakripshan ek hi baar liya ja saktaa he or reedenpshan bhi nunatam tay samay seemaa ke antaraal par hi ho saktaa he
 In this way the liquidity of the close ended scheme is reduced
 adhik jokhim lene kii kshamta vaale log small yaa mid cap skim kaa chunaav kar sakate hai
 These schemes invest in small and medium companies with good prospects

 Apart from this, it is also said that what are the charges that the investor will have to pay when investing in the scheme, such as entry load, exit load, switching charges, recurring expenses etc
 jis yojana main kharche kam aate hon, fund house ke paas niveshak ke liye rakam adhik hogi or isse ritern bhi adhik milane kii ummid banegi
 Such schemes are more beneficial for investors
 kisi bhi yojana ke tahat 65 pratishat se adhik rakam yadi equity main lagaai jane vaali he to aisi yojana ko equity yojana kaha jaataa he
 If the company is going to invest equal amount in equity and debt, then such scheme is covered under the balanced scheme

 The amount of current and other things depends on the nature of the battery or cell being charged
 udhaaharan ke liye trek kii bydaree ko aaweshit karne hetu 20 ampear dhara di ja sakati he jabaki kisi pencil cell ko charge karne ke liye ek ampir se bhi kam dhara chaiye
 The electric circuit of the battery charge consists of, among other things, an AC to DC rectifier and a current controller that maintains the current going into the battery at a reasonable value
 bydaree charger bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke hote hai
 SMPS based circuits are nowadays used in low power charges, which make them relatively small in size
