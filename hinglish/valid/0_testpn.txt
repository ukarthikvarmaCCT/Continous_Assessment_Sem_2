 It is a major train on the kolkata-siliguri route and the Haldibari slip
 british kaal ke dauraan uttar bengal ke liye sabhi conection east bengal ke madhyam se the
 1878, the rail route from Kolkata to Siliguri was in two phases

 The Darjeeling Mail ran on this route in the days before partition
 bharat ke vibhaajan ke baad kuch varshon ke baad bhi yahi maarg jari rahaa
 It was joined by the Assam Mail which ran from Guwahati to Santahar in the pre-partition days
 1947 main bharat ke vibhaajan ke saath, kolkata or silligudi ko jodne main sabase badi baadha yah thi kii ganga ke paar, pashchim bengal yaa bihar main koi pul nahi tha
 a generally accepted route to Siliguri was Sahibganj Loop and Sakragali, sometimes also from Sahibganj Ghat

 Ices: arun, yaa uranus hamaare saura mandal main surya se saatvaan grah he
 It is the third largest planet in the solar system by diameter and the fourth largest planet by mass
 dravyaman main yah prithvi se 14
5 guna adhik baari or akar main prithvi se 63 guna adhik bada he
 On average, it is much less dense than the Earth - because stones and other heavy materials are in greater percentage on Earth, while Arun has more gas
 isiilie prithvi se tiresth guna bada akar rakhane ke baad bhi yah prithvi se keval saadhe chaudaa guna baari he
 Although Arun can also be seen with the eye without binoculars, it is so far away and appears to have such a medium of illumination that the ancient scholars never gave it the status of a planet and considered it a distant flickering star

 In the atmosphere of Arun and Varun, there is more snow than Jupiter and Saturn - in addition to water ice, they also have frozen ammonia and methane gases
 isliye kabhi-kabhi khagolashastri in donon ko "barfile gas daanav" naam kii shrenee main daal dete hai
 Out of all the planets in the solar system, Arun's atmosphere has been found to be coldest and its minimum temperature has been observed to be -49 Calvin

 In 1845, Urbann Le Verrier began his independent research on the orbit of Uranus
 On 23 September 1846 Johann Gottfried Galle discovered a new planet, later renamed Neptune, close to the position predicted by Le Verriere
 urenus ke bheetar kii ghurnan avadhi 17 ghante, 14 minute he
 Like all giant planets, its upper atmosphere also feels very powerful winds in the direction of rotation

 Uranus has an axial inclination of 97
77 degrees, so its rotation is roughly parallel with the axis of the solar system
 yah usko anya pramukh grahon ke vipareet puri tarah se bhinn mausami parivartan detaa he
 Other planets can be seen moving around the solar system at the bottom of the ball, while Uranus cruises like a swinging ball
 urenus sankranti ke vakt ke kareeb, ek dhruv lagaataar surya ke saamne rahata he jabaki doosraa dhruv pare rahata he
 Only the narrow belt around the equator senses rapid day-night cycles, but with the sun far below the horizon, along the way in the Earth's polar regions
 uranus kii kaksha ke duusari ore par surya ke saamne ke dhruvon kaa abhivinyas ulat he
 Each pole gets light continuously around 42 years, then spends the next 42 years in darkness

 Yet Uranus is hotter at its equator than at its poles
 iske liye uttaradaayi antarnihit tantra agyaat he
 The reason for Uranus' unusual axle tilt is also not known with certainty, but as usual speculation is that during the solar system formation, an Earth-sized tributary collided with Uranus and caused this asymmetric orientation
 At the time of Voyager 2's passing in 1986, the south pole of Uranus was almost directly towards the Sun
 grah ke ghurnan kii disha ke maujuud hone ke baavjood, "dakshin" ke rup main pahchaan ke liye iskaa dhruv haal ke antarrashtriya khagoleey sangh dwaara samarthit paribhaasha kaa upyog karata he
 That is, the North Pole of the planet or satellite will be the pole which will be above the invariant plane of the Solar System

 As a result, a density of 1

 The standard model of the Uranus structure is that the planet is composed of three layers: a rocky core in the center, an icy mantle in the middle, and an outer gaseous rind
 The core is relatively small with an Earth mass of 0
55 and a radius less than the 20% radius of Uranus, the mantle incorporates a large amount of planets with 13
4 Earth masses, while the upper atmosphere is comparatively unrealistic with a weight of 0
5 Earth mass
 And extend at a 20% radius of the last edge of Uranus
 urenus ke kor kaa ghanatv 9 gram / se

 The ice mantle is not actually made of ice in the traditional sense, but is a hot and dense fluid composed of ammonia, water, and other volatiles
 is taral padaarth ke paas ek ucch vidyut chaalakata he, jise kabhi kabhi ek taral-ammonia sagar kehalaata he
 Most structures of Uranus and Neptune are very different from those of Jupiter and Saturn, with gases dominating ice, so their distinct classification as ice demons is upheld

 The fluid-rich internal structure of Uranus means that it has no solid surface

 For example, convection can take place in a group of structurally dissimilar layers, which can impede upward heat transport, making it possible that dual diffusive convection may be a limiting factor

 Voyager's observations showed that Uranus' magnetic field is distinct for two reasons, one because it does not originate from the geometric center of the planet and another because it is tilted at 59 ° from the rotational axis
 vastav main yah chumbakeey dwidhruv grah ke centre se dakshin ghurni dhruv kii ore grahiy vyas ke adhiktam ek tihaai jitna khisak gaya he
 This unexpected geometrical result in the high asymmetric magnetosphere, where the strength of the magnetic field on the surface of the southern hemisphere may be the lowest 0
1 gauss, similarly it may be the highest 1
1 gauss in the northern hemisphere

 For comparison, the Earth's magnetic field is roughly powerful at both poles and the 'magnetic equator' is roughly parallel with its geographic equator

 The radius of Titania, the largest of these satellites, is just 788
9 km, or less than half of the moon, but slightly higher than Saturn's second largest moon, Ria, which makes Titania the largest moon in the solar system

 vah bhi karagaar pahunchaae gaye or unhen bhi chalaane ke liye chakki di gai
 Baba asked to walk from the mill without putting his hand but it was his pastime, the mill did not work
 tab unhone paas hi padi ek lakdi uthaakar chakki par maari
 Surprised that all the 981 wheels started running on their own
 samachar paakar nawab ne bahut kshamaa maangi or baba ke aadeshaanusaar yah vachan diya ki us din se jo bhi sadhu mahatma junagarh aayenge unhen baba ke naam par dhai pav aataa roj diya jayega

 Kinaram called the corpse from there, he started coming to the flowing shore and got up and stood up
 baba kinaaraam ne use ghar vaapis bhej diya par uski maan ne use baba kii charanseva ke liye hi chhod diya
 After all, it is said that Kaluram ji appeared in his form and took Kinaram along with him to Krekund where he told him to consider this place as Girnar

 Since then Kinaram started living mainly in the same place

 In short it is enough for us to know this much

 aadi shankaracharya ne bhi apane vishnusahasranam-bhashya main 'vishnu' shabd kaa arth mukhyatah vyapak hi mana he, tathaa uski vyutpatti ke rup main spashtatah likhaa he ki "vyapti arth ke vaachak nuk pratyyant 'vish' dhaatu kaa rup 'vishnu' banataa he"
 He has also taken the 'vishwa Dhatu' option and wrote that "or the negative form of the 'vishva Dhatu' is Vishnu; as stated in Vishnupurana - 'the power of that Mahatma has entered this whole world
 ; Therefore he is called Vishnu, because ‘vish’ dhatu means to enter ”
 rugveda ke pramukh bhashyakaron ne bhi praayah ek swar se 'vishnu' shabd kaa arth vyapak hi kiya he
 In the interpretation of Vishnusukta, Acharya Saiyan means 'vishnu' is pervasive and omnipresent; So Shripad Damodar Satavalekar also takes its meaning related to the generality
 maharishi dayanand saraswati ne bhi 'vishnu' kaa arth anekatra sarvyaapee paramatma kiya he or kai jagah param vidvan ke arth main bhi liya he
 Thus it is clearly reflected that the word 'vishnu' is derived from 'vishu' metal and its meaning is vyapam
 vaidic dev-parampara main sookhton kii sankhyik drushti se vishnu kaa sthaan gaun he kyonki unka stvan maatr 5 sookhton main kiya gaya he; lekin yadi sankhyik drushti se na dekhakar unpar or pahaluon se vichaar kiya jaay to unka mahatva bahut badhkar saamne aata he
 In the Rigveda, he is read with adjectives like 'brihachhriar', Yuvakumar etc
 rugveda main ullikhit vishnu ke swaroop evam vaishishtyon kaa avlokan nimnanki binduon main kiya ja saktaa he :- The unique feature of Vishnu is his three foot-projections, which are mentioned twelve times in the Rigveda
 sambhavtah yah unki sabase badi visheshta he
 His three steps are said to be full of honey, which never diminishes
 unke teen pad-kram itane vistrut hai ki unamem sampoorn lok vidyaman rahete hai 
 'tredha Vichkramana' also transitions to three foot-projections
 ‘urugay’ or ‘urukram’ aadi pad bhi ukt tathy ke parichaayak hai
 Out of his three rankings supplied with Madhu, two are visible, the third is completely imperceptible
 is tisare sarvocch pad ko pakshiyon kii udaan or martya chakshu ke us paar kaha gaya he
 Yask's predecessor Shakupani considers these three footprints to be the symbols of the Sun's movement in three parts of the Universe - Earth, Space and Duloka
 yask ke hi purvavarti aurnavabh unhen surya ke udai, madhyakash main sthiti tathaa ast kaa vaachi maanate hai
 Tilak Sir considers them as a sign of trifurcation of the year
 yadi dekha jaay to adhikansh vidvan vishnu ko surya-vaachi maan kar udaykaal se madhyahn paryant uskaa ek padprakshep, madhyahn se astkaal paryant dwitiya padprakshep or astkaal se punah agrim udaykaal tak tritiy paad-prakshep sweekaarte hai
 These aforesaid two foot projections have been called visible and the third one is unmarked
 lekin mcdanal sahit anya anek vidwaanon kaa bhi kahana he ki is arth main tisare charan ko 'sarvocch' kaise mana ja saktaa he? isliye ve log purvokt shakpuni kii tarah teen charnon ko saura devtaa ke teenon lokon main se hokar jane ke maarg ko maanate hai
 Supporting the idea of the Sun, mcdanal mentions the operation of his 90 horse by Vishnu, each of which has four names
 is prakaar 4 kii sankhya se gunikrut 90 arthath 360 ashwon ko ve ek saura varsh ke dinon se abhinn maanate hai
 In fact, the two terms of Vishnu indicate the control of the whole world and his attainment of the third post i
e
 His ultimate abode
 swayan rugveda main hi in teen padon kii rahasyatmak vyakhya kii gayi he
 Therefore, considering this verse as knowledgeable, it has been clearly stated in the Rigveda that the ultimate post of Vishnu is known only by the learned people
 vaise to vishnu ko vaani main nivas karne vaala bhi mana jaataa he, kintu unka param priy awaas sthal 'pathah' rugveda main bahucharchit he
 Acharya Sayan considered the term 'giri' to be a courtesy, along with its meaning 'vani', as well as figuratively 'advanced folk like a mountain'
 'giri' ko yadi in donon arthon main sweekrut kar liya jaay to samasya kaa samaadhaan ho jaataa he
 Where Vishnu reaches the third position is his place of residence
 vishnu kaa lok ‘param pad’ he arthath gantavya roopen vah sarvotkrisht lok he
 The specialty of that 'param pad' is that it is highly illuminated
 vahaan anek shringon vaali gaayen sancharan kiya karti hai
 'gavah' is like a courtesy here
 shlesh se uskaa arth ‘gaayen’ karne par vahaan dugdh aadi bhautik pushti kaa prachurya evam ‘kirane’ karne par vahaan prakaash arthath atmik unnati kaa bahulya sahaj hi anumey he
 The 'param Pad' of Vishnu has a permanent emanation of Madhu
 yah ‘madhu’ devataaon ko bhi anandit karanevaala he
 Whatever meaning is given to this elegant verse, but it is a sign of bliss in every situation, for which all the creatures including the deity are also desirous and are also trying
 isliye ukt lok kii prapti kii kaamana sabhi karte hai
 In the same mantra, there are also mentions of virtuous people there, while experiencing fulfillment
 vishnu kii ek pramukh visheshta unka indra se maitribhav he
 Indra's companionship enforces his three footsteps
 indra ke saath milakar vah shambar daitya ke 99 kilon kaa vinaash karte hai
 In the same way, he also helps Indra in the battle with vrittra
 donon ko kahin-kahin ek duusare kii shaktiyon se yukt bhi batalaaya gaya he
 Thus Sompan by Vishnu and three foot projections by Indra are also described
 rugveda, mandal 6, sookt 69 main donon devon kaa yugmaroopen stvan hua he
 Similarly, in the verse 5, Sukta 87 of the Rigveda, he gets his help with Indra's fellow Marudagans
 vish dhaatu se vyutpann vishnu pad kaa shabdic arth ‘vyapak, gatisheel, kriyasheel athwa udhyam-sheel’ hota he
 They are praised by the people due to their force and disorder
 ve anant veeryavale hai
 Due to this quality, he is also considered as ‘vrishna’ symbolically
 apane veery athwa vir karmon ke kaaran ve shatruon ke bhay kaa kaaran hai
 People are afraid of them in the same way as a mountain lion
 ‘parameshwaradbhitih’ aadi shruti-vachanon se saamaanya janon kaa bhi unase bhay karnaa siddh ho jaataa he
 Being afraid of them is not without reason
 ve kutsiton kaa vadh aadi hinsakarm karne vaale hai
 It is important to note here that they kill the snotty violent person
 isliye unke liye kaha gaya he ki ve hatyare nahin hai
 Vishnu is wide-ranging, broad and of unrestrained speed
 ‘urugay’ or ‘urukram’ aadi pad is tathy ke poshak hai
 The meaning of 'uruguay' is not even glorified by Acharya Sayan by 'mahajajans doing Stuyaman' or 'prabhutya Stuyaman'
 da
yadunandan mishra kaa kahana he ki is pad kaa arth ‘visteern gati vaala’ karne ke liye ham is liye aagrahvan hai, kyonki use ‘sabhi lokon main sancharan karne vaala’ kaha gaya he
 Their rankings are so long that they measure the three worlds with their three footprints
 vishnu ke teen pad yadi sristi karte hai, sthaapan karte hai, dhaaran karte hai to vahiin par ashrith janon kaa paalan-poshan bhi kiya karte hai
 People receive their bhagya annadi as a prasad of the same three order, so that they experience ultimate fulfillment
 jo log vishnu kii stuti karte hai, unka ve sarvavidh kalyaan karte hai, kyonki unke stavnadi karm se use param sphurti milti he
 In this way, everyone is eager to reach the praise of Lord Vishnu
 ve varisht daata hai
 Trinity is also reflected in the qualities of Vishnu
 ve teen pad-kram vaale, teen prakaar kii gati karne vaale, teenon lokon ko naap lene vaale or lokatray ke dharak hai
 Similarly, he is also the equated form of 'tridhatu' ie satta, raja and tama or containing earth, water and light
 vishnu parthiv lokon kaa nirmaan or param vistrut antariksh aadi lokon kaa prasthaapan karne vaale hai
 They are the three types of movement in self-constructed worlds
 unki ye teen gatiyaan udbhav, sthiti or vilay kii pratik hai
 In this way, they are also the creators of everyone, both spinach and destroyer
 ve 'lokatray kaa akelaa dharak' hai
 They measure all three worlds alone with their three footprints
 lokatray ko naap lene se bhi yah falit hota he ki lokatray arthath vahaan ke samgr praani unke purna niyantran main hai
 Vishnu is also an embryo-protector
 garbhasth beej kii raksha ke liye or sundar balak kii utpatti ke liye vishnu kii prarthana kii jaati he
 Due to the clear emphasis on his foster nature, he has been called 'vishnurgopa Paraman Pati 

' meaning the protector of all, even in the Ahoratra fire form in the Rigveda
 acharya sayan rugveda ke ashtum mandal ke pachchisven sookt ke barahawein mantra kii vyakhya main bhi vishnu ko spasht rup se 'paalan se yukt' maanate hai
 xxrep 4 
 isliye samgr pariprekshya main rugveda main vishnu ko param hitaishi kaha gaya he
 Despite being mentioned in most mantras, Indra is called 'sukrit' and Vishnu is called 'sukritara'
 'sukruttarah' kaa acharya sayan ne 'uttam fal pradaan karne waalon main shreshth' arth kiya he; shripad satavlekar ji ne 'uttam karm karne waalon main sarvshereshth' arth kiya he or maharishi dayanand saraswati ji ne bhi 'ativ uttam karm vaala' arth kiya he
 Indra is 'sukrit' and Vishnu is 'sukritarah'
 taatpary spasht he ki rugveda main hi yah maan liya gaya he ki vishnu sarvocch hai
 Similarly, despite being the king of Indra, the supremacy of Vishnu is also clear in the Rigveda that in it it is said for Vishnu that "he holds the whole world alone" and Indra is told that he States do
 taatpary spasht he ki sristi ke sarjak evam paalak vishnu ne sanchaalan hetu indra ko raja banaaya he
 In this well-defined perspective, Brahmin texts related to the supremacy of Vishnu and later mythological beliefs also spontaneously emerge
 brahman-yug main yajna-sanstha kaa vipul vikaas hua or iske saath hi devamandali main vishnu kaa mahatva bhi pehle kii apeksha adhiktar ho gaya
 At the beginning of Aitareya Brahmana, in order to give place in yagya, starting with fire, Vishnu's place has been called 'param'
 inke madhya anya devataaon kaa sthaan he
 In this way, Vishnu has been given a much higher place in the Vedic Samhita texts than the fire that attained the foremost place
 vastutah vishnu ko mahattam to rugveda main bhi mana hi gaya he, par varnan kii alpata ke kaaran vahaan unka sthaan gaun lagata he
 He has been given the highest rank by the explicit statement in the Brahmin texts
 yah shreshthata is katha se bhi spasht hoti he ki vishnu ne apane teen pagon dwaara asuron se prithvi, veda tathaa vaani sab chhinakar indra ko de di
 This is the narrative conversion of the three steps of the Vedic Vishnu into Brahmins; And with this, the superiority of Vishnu also became clear in the Brahmin era itself
 aitarey brahman spasht rup se vishnu ko dwarpal kii tarah devataaon kaa sarvatha sangrakshak maanata he
 The signs available in the Rigveda and the Brahmins have had substantial additions to the Puranas - narrative as well, descriptive as well as explanatory
 puraanon ne is jagat ke mul main vartmaan, nity, ajanma, akshay, avyay, ekares tathaa hey ke abhaav se nirmal parabrahm ko hi vishnu sangya di he
 He is devoid of instructions and adjectives like 'paranaam Par:', the divine located in the inner soul, the supreme superior and the form, varna etc
 ve janm, vruddhi, parinaam, kshay or naash -- in chah vikaron se rahit hai
 They are widespread and the whole world is inhabited by them; That is why scholars call him 'vasudev'
 jis samay din, raat, akaash, prithvi, andhkaar, prakaash tathaa inke atirikt bhi kuch nahin tha, us samay ekmaatr vahi pradhan purush param brahm vidyaman the, jo ki indriyon or buddhi ke vishay nahin hai
 At the beginning of the universe, the same sentiment expressed by Lord Vishnu as Chatur Shloki Bhagwat in the original knowledge of Brahma, - i was the only one before creation
 mere atirikt na sthool tha na sookshm or na donon kaa kaaran agyaan
 Where this is not a creation, i am the one and i am the one who seems to be in the form of this creation and i am the one who will survive
 in sandarbhon se vishnu kii sarvocchata tathaa sarvaniyanta hone kii bhaavana spasht parilakshith hoti he
 Vishnu is believed to have two forms
 pratham rup-- pradhan purush or doosraa rup 'kaal' he
 These both combine and separate both creation and holocaust, or nature and man
 yah kaal rup bhagavan anadi tathaa anant hai; isliye sansar kii utpatti, sthiti or pralay bhi kabhi nahin rukate
 In the context of the origin of creation in the Bhagavata Maha Purana, known as the Sirmour of the Vaishnavas and the 'tilak of Puranas', it is said that the lotus emerged from the navel of Vishnu, who slept in Ekarnava, and realized all the qualities in it
 With the entry of Vishnu himself, the Vedmaya Brahma automatically emerged
 isi prakaar adhikansh puraanon main vishnu ko param brahm ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The Puranas are full of stories related to them
 paalankarta hone ke kaaran unhen jaagtik drushti se yada-kada vividh prapanchon kaa bhi sahaara lenaa padataa he
 Suggesting deception to be tricked by the Asuras, advising the gods on sea-churning for regaining sovereignty when the Asuras seize the kingdom; And by taking the form of erotic Mohini and enticing the Asuras to feed the nectar to the gods; Vishnu's deception in the stories mentioned in the sub-divisions like Devi Bhagwat and Shivpuran related to dissolving the essence of Tulsi for the slaughter of Shankhchud
 is sambandh main yah anivarytah dhyatavya he ki paalankarta hone ke kaaran ve parinaam dekhte hai
 Due to the disenfranchisement of the asuras / unjust by any boon, if the end of the unjust and deceit is scandalized, they do not hesitate to cheat
 ramavatar main chhipakar bali ko maarna tathaa krishnavatar main mahabharat yuddh main anek chhalon kaa vidhayak bananaa unke isi drushtikon kaa parichaayak he
 Carpenters use these stories as an antidote to arbitrary interpretation
 parantu inhen sandarbhik gyaan kii drushti se dekhnaa isliye aavashyak he kyonki puraanon yaa tatsambandhi granthon main ye prasang vipareet sthitiyon main saamaanya se itar vishisht kartavya ke gyaan hetu hi upasthaapit kiye gayi hai
 It is important to note that in Puranas, elemental knowledge is called Brahma, God and God
 vishnu kaa sampoorn swaroop gyanatmak he
 In the Puranas, the jewelery and armaments worn by them are also considered symbolic: - is prakaar samast srujanaatmak upadan tattvon ko vishnu apane sharir par dhaaran kiye rahete hai
 a stanza related to the figure of Srivishnu is very famous: - shantakaaran bhujagashyann padmanabhan sureshm
 Vishvadharan Gaganasudrash Megha Varnam Shubhangam
 
 Lakshmikantam Kamalanayanan Yogibhirdhyanagyam
 vande vishnu bhavabhayaharan sarvalokaikanatham
 
 bhavarth - jinaki akruti atishay shant he, jo sheshnag kii shaiya par shayan kiye hue hai, jinaki naabhi main camel he, jo devataaon ke bhi ishwar or sampurna jagat ke aadhaar hai, jo akaash ke sadrush sarvatra vyaapt hai, nilmegh ke samaan jinka varna he, atishay sundar jinke sampurna ang hai, jo yogiyon dwaara dhyaan karke praapt kiye jate hai, jo sampurna lokon ke swami hai, jo janm-maran rup bhay kaa naash karne vaale hai, aise lakshmipathi, kamalnetra bhagwaan vishnu ko main pranaam karata hoon
 Vishnu's superiority does not mean that Shiva or Brahma etc
 are inferior to him
 oonch-neech kaa bhav ishwar ke paas nahin hota
 It is just a priority to be virtuous in Leela for creation and operation
 isliye vaishnav ho yaa shaiva -- sabhi puraana tathaa mahabharat jaise shreshth granth ek swar se ghoshit karte hai ki ishwar ek hi hai
 It is said that the same Lord Janardhana holds these three nouns - 'brahma', 'vishnu' and 'shiva' - for the creation, condition and destruction of the world
 anekatra vishnu tathaa shiv ke ek hi hone ke spasht kathan uplabdh hote hai
 The word 'avatar' literally means the manifestation of God in the physical world through his independent power
 avatar kii siddhi do dashaon main maani jaati he -- ek to apane rup kaa parityag kar kaaryvash naveen rup kaa grahan; tathaa doosraa naveen janm grahan kar sambaddh rup main aana, jisamen mata ke garbh main uchit kaal tak ek sthiti kii baat bhi sannivisht he
 It does not involve changing the form for a short time or regaining the form of another
 shrimadbhagavadgita ke chaturth adhyay ke suprasiddh saatven evam aathven shloke main bhagavan ne swayan avatar kaa prayojan bataate hue kaha he ki -- jab-jab dharm kii haani or adharm kaa utthan ho jaataa he, tab-tab sajjanon ke paritran or dushton ke vinaash ke liye main vibhinn yugon main utpann hota hoon
 Apart from this, a specific and more lofty purpose has been said in the Bhagavata Mahapurana that God is beyond the nature of growth, destruction, etc
, is indestructible, eternal, nirguna
 to yadi ve avatar rup main apni lila ko prakat nahin karte to jeev unke ashesh gunon ko kaise samajhate? atah jeevon ke preranaroop kalyaan ke liye unhone apane ko tathaa apni lila ko prakat kiya
 Therefore, there are many odd situations in different avatar-stories so that the organism can understand what the proper path is according to the situation! vishnu ke avtaron kii pehali vyavasthit suchi mahabharat main uplabdh hoti he
 The total number of incarnations in Shantiparva of Mahabharata is stated to be 10: - hans: kurmashch matsyasch pradurbhava dwijottam 
 Varaho Narasimhash Vamno Ram & Ch
 raamo dashrathishchaev satvat: kalkirev c 
 That is, Hans Kurm Matsya Varaha Narasimha Vaman Parashurama Dasharathanandan Ram Yaduvanshi Shri Krishna and Kalki - all these are my avatars
 aage yah bhi kaha gaya he ki ye bhoot or bhavishya ke sabhi avatar hai
 The description in the text is of six incarnations: 1
 Varaha 2
 Narasimha 3
 Vaman 4
 Parasurama 5
 Ram 6
 Krishna chunki mahabharat buddha ke janm se purv kii athwa buddha ke avtari hone kii kalpana se pehle kii rachana he; atah swaabhaavik rup se usamen kahin buddha kaa namonishaan nahin he
 Instead of counting the swan as an avatar, the number of the Dash is complete
 mahabharat ke dakshinatya paath main avatar kaa varnan is prakaar he :- Matsya: Kurmo Varahash Narasimhash Vamana: raamo ramashch ramashch krishna: kalki c te dash
 Here, from the aforesaid incarnations, leaving the swan and adding the third Rama i
e
 Balarama, the number of Dash is complete
 is vivaran se ek baat pramanit ho jaati he ki mahabharat-kaal tak dash se adhik avtaron kii kalpana bhi nahin kii gayi thi; anyathaa un dash avtaron ko 'bhoot or bhavishya ke bhi sabhi avatar' nahin kaha gaya rahata
 Later, other avatars were also conceived and the total number of incarnations reached twenty-four
 bhagwat mahapurana main 22 tathaa 24 avtaron kii gananaa ke baavjood avtaron kii bahumanya sankhya mahabharat vaali dash hi rahi he
 Many Puranas like Padmapuran, Lingapurana, Varahapuran, Matsyapuran etc
 have mentioned about the same avatars
 agnipurana ke varnan main bhi bilkul vahi kram he
 The following verses of this context are generally universal: matsayah kurmo varahashch narsinghoth vamanh
 Ramo Ramash Krishnashta Buddha: Kalkishcha Te Dash is prakaar vishnu ke dash avatar hi bahumanyata praapt hai
 The brief details of these are as follows: - dashavathar ke atirikt anya chaudaa avtaron ke naam is prakaar hai :- R

 sharir ke vividh angon se hriday tak rudhir le janevaali vahiniyon ke phool jane or tedi-medhi ho jane ko apsfit shira kehete hai
 The reason for this disease is: Veins carry blood from the tissues to the heart
 shiraaon ko gurutvkarshan ke vipareet rakt ko taangon se hriday main le janaa padataa he
 To support this upward flow, there are many capillaries inside the veins
 kapatikaay rakt ko keval upar kii hi ore jane detii hai
 When the capillaries weaken, or are nowhere near, the blood does not climb up well and sometimes flows downwards
 aisi dasha main shirayen phool jaati hai or lambaai bad jane se tedi-medhi bhi ho jaati hai
 These are called varicose veins

 The way in which the teacher imparts knowledge to the learner is called teaching method
 "shikshan vidhi" pad kaa prayog bade vyapak arth main hota he
 On the one hand, many systems and schemes are included in it, on the other hand many teaching procedures are also included
 kabhi-kabhi log yuktiyon ko bhi vidhi maan lete hai; parantu aisa karnaa bhul he
 Tips can be part of a method, not a complete method
 ek hi yukti anek vidhiyon main prayukt ho sakati he
 There can be two ways of presenting the text
 ek main chaatro ko koi saamaanya siddhant bataakar uski jaanch yaa pushti ke liye anek udhaaharan die jate hai
 In the second, a general rule is extracted from the students by giving several examples first
 pehali vidhi ko nigamanaatmak vidhi or duusari ko aagamanaatmak vidhi kehete hai
 This method is considered most suitable for grammar teaching
 duusare drushtikon se shikshan vidhi ke do anya prakaar ho sakate hai
 If the method of presenting the text is such that by first giving the knowledge of the organs and then the knowledge of the complete object is made, then it is called the synthesis method
 jaise hindi padhaane main pehle varnmaala sikhaakar tab shabdon kaa gyaan karaayaa jaataa he
 Then words are made into sentences
 parantu yadi pehle vaakya sikhaakar tab shabd or ant main varna sikhaye jaaen to yah vishleshnatmak vidhi kehalaaegi kyonki isamen purna se angon kii ore chalate hai
 One of the well-known sources of teaching is "from the tangible to the intangible"
 vastav main hamen bahya sansar kaa gyaan apni gyanendriyon ke dwaara hota he jinamein netra pramukh hai
 When we see an object, we get a general introduction to it
 at: moort vastu gyaan pradaan karne kaa sabase saral saadhan he
 That is why, from the beginning, the object method is resorted to, that is, to teach children, the objects are demonstrated and imparted knowledge about them
 yahan tak ki amoort ko bhi moort banane kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he
 For example, to explain three and two five, first three tablets are placed in front of the students
 phir unamem do goliyaan or milakar sabko ek saath ginate hai tab teen or do paanch spasht ho jaataa he
 Another form of the object is parable
 vastuvidhi main jis prakaar vastuon ke dwaara gyaan pradaan kiya jaataa he drushtaantvidhi main usee prakaar drushtaanton ke dwaara
 Parables can be visual as well as audible
 isamen chitra, maanchitr, chitrapat aadi ke sahare vastu kaa spashtikan kiya jaataa he
 Also the subject can be clarified by simile, example, story, jokes etc
 vastu evam drushtaantvidhiyon se gyaan praapt karte karte jab bacchon ko kuch kuch anumaan karne tathaa apratyaksh vastu ko bhi samajhane kaa abhyaas ho jaataa he tab, kathanvidhi kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 In this, students are given knowledge of the text by description
 parantu is vidhi main chaatr adhiktar niskriy shrota bane rahete hai or pathan prabhaavshaalee nahin hota
 This is what famous educationist Herbert Spencer has said - "children should be told at least, they should learn more and more by self-knowledge"
 vyaakhyanvidhi isi kii sahachari he
 In higher classes, the use of lectures is often considered beneficial
 kathanvidhi main praaia: herbert ke paanch sopanon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 They are parantu keval gnanarjan ke paathon main hi paanchon sopanon kaa prayog hota he
 Only a few limited steps are used in the lessons of skill and taste
 prashn yadhyapi ek yukti he phir bhi sucraat ne prashnottar ko ek vidhi ke rup main prayog karke ise adhik mahatv pradaan kiya he
 This is called the Socratic method
 isamen prashnkarta se hi prashn kiye jate hai or uske uttaron ke aadhaar par usee se prashn karte-karte apekshit uttar nikalava liya jaataa he
 Ever since the development of child psychology has proved that the center of education is neither a subject, nor a teacher, but a student, since then activism has started to be given more importance in teaching
 karke siikhnaa arthath swanubhav dwaara gyaan praapt karnaa, aajkal kaa sarvaadhik vyapak shikshansiddhant he
 Therefore, academics from Russia to Montessori and Duby have placed more emphasis on making children's senses more functional and giving education through them
 mahatma gandhi ne bhi isi siddhant ke aadhaar par basic shiksha ko janm diya
 Therefore, many methods can be included under active method such as research method, planning method, Dalton system, basic-education-method, etc
 germany ke professor armastrong dwaara shodhvidhi kaa pratipaadan hua tha
 In this method, the students are motivated to find out the facts themselves by placing them in the appropriate environment
 iskaa yah arth nahin he ki adhyaaapak kuch nahin karata or chaatro ko manamaana kaam karne ko chhod detaa he
 To be honest, he leads the student and keeps him on the straight path, removing him from the wrong path
 uskaa lakshya yah rahata he ki jo gyaan chaatr apane nirikshan athwa prayog dwaara praapt kar saktaa he use bataaya na jaae
 This method was first used in science education
 phir dhire-dhire ganit, bhugol tathaa anya vishyon main bhi iskaa prayog hone laga
 Planning method is the result of the combined efforts of famous American academics Duvie, Kilpatrick, Stevenson, etc
 iske anusaar gyanprapti ke liye swaabhaavik vaataavaran adhik upyukt hota he
 To teach with this method, first a problem is taken, which is often raised by the students and they are planned by them to solve that problem and the plan is completed in a natural environment
 isi se isaki paribhaasha is prakaar kii jaati he ki yojana vah samasyamoolak kaary he jo swaabhaavik vaataavaran main purna kiya jaae
 From 1912 to 1915 in a place called Dalton, USA, Miss Helen Parkhurst used a new method of education called the Dalton Plan
 yah vidhi kakshashikshan ke dosha ko dur karne ke liye avishkrut kii gai thi
 The laboratory replaces the classroom in the Dalton Plan
 prayek vishay kii ek prayogshaala hoti he, jisamen us vishay ke adhyayan ke liye pustaken, chitra, maanchitr tathaa anya saamagree ke atirikt sandarbhagranth bhi rahete hai
 The specialist teacher of the subject sits in the laboratory and assists the students, checking and revising their work
 varsh bhar kaa kaary 9 yaa 10 bhaagon main baantak nirdhaarit kaary ke rup main prayek chaatr ko likhit diya jaataa he
 The student completes the prescribed work by visiting various laboratories according to his interest
 kaary anvitiyon main banta rahata he
 As much as the discovery work is completed, it is mentioned on its chart
 ek maas kaa kaary puraa ho jane par hi duusare maas kaa nirdhaarit kaary diya jaataa he
 In this way, the progress of the student depends on the work done by him
 is yojana main chaatro ko apni ruchi or suvidha ke anusaar kaary karne kii chhot rahati he
 Due to studying from the original sources, they also have self-reliance
 is yojana ke anek roopaantar hue jaise- batevia, vinetka aadi yojanaayen
 Although the Dacroulli plan precedes it, changes have been made to its principles based on the Dalton Plan
 mahatma gandhi kii wardha yojana yaa basic shiksha bhi apane dhang kii ek shikshavidhi he
 Gandhiji gave priority to 'hand work' in education in view of the then state of the country
 unka vishwaas tha ki jab tak chaatr haath se kaam nahin karata tab tak use shram kaa mahatv nahin gyaat hota
 Theoretical knowledge makes man egoistic and passive
 at: bacchon ko aarambh se hi kisi na kisi hastkaushal ke dwaara shiksha deni chahie
 Agriculture and spinning-weaving are basic occupations in our country in which three-fourths of the people of the country are engaged
 at: unhone inhen donon ko mul hastkaushal maanakar shiksha main pramukh sthaan diya
 The main features of basic education are: - antim siddhant kaa bada virodh hua or basic shiksha main se hataa diya gaya
 English education has crippled most of the educated section of the country that they believe to work by hand
 yahi kaaran he ki sampann tathaa ucch varg ke logon ne buniyadi shiksha ke prati udaseenta dikhaai jisase yah shiksha keval nirdhan varg ke liye rah gai he
 Therefore, it is slowly failing
 uparyukt vivechan se yah spasht he ki shikshanvidhiyaan anek hai
 It has been enforced by some educationist under some special circumstances
 vastav main prayek adhyaaapak kii apni shikshavidhi hoti he jisase va chaatro ko unki ruchi tathaa yogyata ke anuroop gyaan pradaan karata he
 The method for which it is more useful is the best method

 Although there are many means of information available in relation to the ancient literature and philosophy of India, but the means of information about the ancient history of India is not satisfactory
 unki nunata ke kaaran ati pracheen bhartiya samskruti evam shashan kaa kramvaddh itihaas nahin miltaa he
 Nevertheless, there are such tools available, whose study and survey gives us an idea of the story of India's antiquity
 in sadhano ke adhyayan ke bina ateet or vartmaan bharat ke nikat ke sambandh kii jaankaree karnaa bhi asambhav he
 The means of information about the history of ancient India can be divided into two parts - literary means and archaeological means, which are both native and foreign
 saahitiyik saadhan do prakaar ke hai- dharmik sahitya or loukik sahitya
 There are also two types of religious literature - the Brahmin text and the Abrahamic book
 brahman granth do prakaar ke hai - shruti jisamen veda, brahman, upanishad ityadi aate hai or smriti jiske antargat ramayana, mahabharat, puraana, smritiyaan aadi aati hai
 Cosmic literature is also of four types - historical literature, foreign accounts, biographical and fiction-oriented and fiction literature
 puratathvik samagriyon ko teen bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he - abhilekh, mudraaen tathaa bhagnavshesh smarak
 The following table makes these source tools more clear- pracheen bhartiya itihaas kii jaankaree ke pramukh saadhan saahitiyik granth hai jinhen do upkhandon main rakhaa ja saktaa he-dharmik sahitya or loukik sahitya
 It is necessary to mention them separately
 brahman yaa dharmik sahitya- brahman granth pracheen bhartiya itihaas kaa gyaan pradaan karne main atyadhik sahyog dete hai
 The oldest literature of India is primarily religious
 aise anek brahman granth hai jinke dwaara pracheen bharat kii sabhyataa tathaa samskruti kii kahani jaani jaati he
 They are the following main- aise granthon main veda sarvaadhik pracheen hai or ve sabase pehle aate hai
 The Vedas are the oldest texts of the Aryans, which are four - the spread of the Aryans from the Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda; Mutual warfare; The non-aryans, slaves, slaves and dacoits get a specific amount of information about their continuous struggle and their social, religious and economic organization
 isi prakaar atharvaveda se tatkaaleen samskruti tathaa vidhaon kaa gyaan praapt hota he
 The prose commentaries of Vedic mantras and samhitas are called Brahmins
 puraatan brahman main aitarey, shatapath, panchvish, taitareey aadi vishesh mahatvapurn hai
 The study of Aitareya gives the knowledge of the coronation and the names of the anointed nymphs
 shathpath ke ek sau adhyay bharat ke pashchimottar ke gandhar, shalya tathaa keky aadi or praachya desh, kuru, paanchal, koshal tathaa videh ke sambandh main aitihaasik kahaniyaan prastut karte hai
 The story of King Parikshit has become more clear by the Brahmins
 upanishdon main ‘brihadaaranyak’ tathaa ‘chandonya’, sarvaadhik prasiddh hai
 The state of India before Bimbisara can be known from these texts
 parakshit, unke putr janamejay tathaa pashchaatkaaleen raajaaon kaa ullekh inhen upanishdon main kiya gaya he
 It is clear from these Upanishads that the philosophy of Aryans was the best and more ahead of the philosophy of other civilized countries of the world
 aaryon ke aadhyatmik vikaas pracheenatam dharmik avasthaa or chintan ke jite jaagate jivant udhaaharan inhen upanishdon main milte hai
 Later, branches of six disciplines were born for Vedic studies called 'vedang'
 vedang kaa shabdic arth he vedon kaa ang, tathaapi is sahitya ke paurushey hone ke kaaran shruti sahitya se pruthak hi gina jaataa he
 They are - education, kalpa, grammar, nirukta, chhandashastra and astrology
 vaidic shakhaon ke antargat hi unka pruthakri-pruthak varg sthapit hua or inhen virgon ke paathya granthon ke rup main sutron kaa nirmaan hua
 The Kalpasutras were divided into four parts - the Shruta Sutras which were related to the Mahayagas, the Griha Sutras which throw light on the home rites, the Dharma Sutras which were related to religion and religious rules, the Shulava Sutras which are Yajna, havan-kuntha Bedi, Naam etc
 Were related to
 vedang se jahaan ek ore pracheen bharat kii dharmik avasthaaon kaa gyaan praapt hota he, vahaan duusari ore isaki saamaajik avasthaa kaa bhi
 Edit Ramayana and literary resources in response to Vedic literature pracheen bhartiya itihaas kii jaankaree ke pramukh saadhan saahitiyik granth hai jinhen do upkhandon main rakhaa ja saktaa he-dharmik sahitya or loukik sahitya
 It is necessary to mention them separately
 brahman yaa dharmik sahitya- brahman granth pracheen bhartiya itihaas kaa gyaan pradaan karne main atyadhik sahyog dete hai
 The oldest literature of India is primarily religious
 aise anek brahman granth hai jinke dwaara pracheen bharat kii sabhyataa tathaa samskruti kii kahani jaani jaati he
 He follows the following main two epic literature called Mahabharata
 sampoorn dharmik sahitya main ye donon mahakavy apana vishisht sthaan rakhte hai
 Ramayana was composed by Maharishi Balmiki, which contains the Ramakatha of Ayodhya
 isamen rajya seemaa, yawanon or shakon ke nagar, shashan kaary raamarajy aadi kaa varnan he
 The original Mahabharata was created by Sage Vyasa
 mahabharat kaa vartmaan rup pracheen itihaas kathaon upadeshon aadi kaa bhandar he
 This book sheds light on the ancient social and religious stages of India
 in donon mahakavyon kii sabase badi visheshta yah he ki ve arya samskruti ke dakshin main prasar kaa nirdesh karte hai
 The knowledge we have received from the then powerful districts and 'mahabharata' of 'sudhaman' and 'devasabha' in the Ramayana shows the extent to which the king was an autocrat and to what extent his influence and work were limited by these political institutions and public representation
 Was finite
 mahakavyon ke pashchaat puraana aate hai jinaki sankhya atharah he
 The credit of his creation is given to ‘sut’ Lomhadrasha or his son Ugrashravas or Ugrashravas
 puraanon main paanch prakaar ke vishyon kaa varnan siddhantatah is prakaar he-sarg, pratisarg, vansh, manwantar tathaa vanshanucharit
 The canto is the myth of the seed or the beginning of the universe
 It is called the reintroduction of the post-apocalyptic holocaust, the dynasty describes the genealogical trees of the gods or sages, Manvantara describes the great ages of kalpa, in which each man's father is a manu and The parts of the hereditary Puranas are those in which the tables of the dynasties are given and there are descriptions of political stages, stories and events
 uparyukt paanch puraana ke vishay hote hue bhi atharahon puraanon main vanshanucharit kaa prakaran praapt nahin hota
 This is unfortunate because in the Puranas, which is a more important subject from the historical point of view, it is hereditary
 vanshanucharit keval bhavishya, matsay, vaayu, vishnu, brahmand tathaa bhagwat puraanon main hi praapt hota he
 The garuda-purana also gives the table of the Paurava, Ikshvaku and Barhadya dynasties
 par inaki tithi purnataya anishchit he
