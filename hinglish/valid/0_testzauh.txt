 The most commonly used method for predicting medical probability, the Wells score, is a medical prediction rule that is complicated due to its multiple versions

 In a 2000-year publication, Wells proposed two different scoring arrangements using cutoffs of 2 or 4 with the same prediction rule
 In 2001, Wells published findings using more than 2 cutoffs to create three categories
 An additional version was proposed using the updated cutoff of 2, with a "revised detailed version" but incorporating the findings of preliminary studies in Wales
 bahut haal hi main, baad ke ek adhyayan ne keval do shrenee ke nirmaan ke liye wales ke 4 point ke ek katof ke praarambhik upyog ko ulat diya

 This is confirmed by a recent systematic review of patient studies with low pre-test probability of PE, and a negative D-dimer result found a three-month risk of thromboembolic phenomena in patients isolated from such behavior and 0

 Ventilation / perfusion scan, which shows that some parts of the lungs are being ventilated but not sprinkled with blood
 This type of examination experiment is often underperformed due to the more widespread availability of CT techniques, although it may be useful in patients allergic to iodinated contrast or in pregnancy due to lower radiation performance than CT

 Low-risk patients may not undergo further tests for PE without any of these criteria: hypoxia - sao2 50 hormone use, tachycardia
 The rationale behind this decision is that subsequent tests can cause more harm than the risk of PE

 vikshat ek hindi shabd he
 The ethics and ritual types of kauls are known as kaulachar
 shaktamat ke anusaar sadhnakshetra main teen bhaavon tathaa saat aacharon kii vishisht sthiti hoti he- pashubhav, veerabhaav or divyabhaav
 These are the signs of three expressions
 vedachar, vaishnavachaar, shaivachaar, dakshinchaar, vamachar, siddhantachaar or kaulachar ye purvollikhit bhavatray se sambhddha saat aachaar hai
 Among them, the seeker of divine feeling is related to Kaulachara

 Kaulachar is considered to be the best among the Tantric ethos, as it is completely untouched and untouched by the divine seeker who is immersed in the perfect monotheistic spirit
 kinhin aacharyon kii sammati main samayaachaar hi shreshth, vishuddh tantric aachaar he tathaa kaulachar usase bhinn tantric maarg he
 Shankaracharya and his followers were followers of Samyachara, while Abhinavagupta and Gaudiyashakta were followers of Kaulachara

 Lakshmidhar, the commentator of Beauty Lahiri, has directed two distinct differences of the Kauls in the interpretation of verse 41
 unke anusaar purvakaul shri chakra ke bheetar sthit yoni kii puja karte hai; uttarkaul sundari taruni ke pratyaksh yoni ke poojak hai or anya makaaron kaa bhi pratyaksh prayog karte hai
 Due to these incestuous rituals of Uttarakaul, Kaulachara began to be known as Vamachara and became a part of the public's disinterest and disregard
 kaulachar ke is uttarkalin rup par tibeti tantron kaa prabhaav bahush: lakshith hota he
 According to the story of Gandharvatantra, Taraantra, Rudrayamal and Vishnayamal, this form of worship was brought to Vashistha in Kamrup by bringing it from Mahachin

this sensitive prince was greatly damaged due to punyashlok chhatrapati shri shivaji maharaj ke rajbhishek or hindu swarajya ke baad sthapit ashtapradhan mantrimandal main se kuch logon kii raajkaaran ke vajah se yah samvedansheel yuvaraj kaaphi kshatigrast hue the
 Despite being mighty, he was kept away from many battles
 swabhaavat: samvedansheel rahanevaale sambhaji raaje unke pita shivaji maharaj ji ke ajna anusaar mughaalo ko ja mili taaki ve unhe gumraah kar sake
 Because at that time Maratha army had returned from Digvijay in the south direction and they needed time to get excited again
 isaliye mughaalo ko gumraah karane ke liye punyashlok chhatrapati shri shivaji maharaj ji ne hi unhe bhej tha vah ek rajtantr tha
 Later, Chhatrapati Shri Shivaji Maharaj Ji freed him from the Mughals
 magar is prayaas main wo patni rani durgabai or bahen godavari unako apane saath len main asafal rahe
 After the death of Punyashlok Chhatrapati Shivaji Shri Maharaj, some people tried to thrice Anuj Rajaram of Dharmaveer student father Shri Sambhaji Maharaj
 kintu senapati mohite ke rahete yah karsthan naakaamayaab hua or 10 janvari 1681 ko sambhaji maharaj kaa vidhiwat rajbhishek hua
 In the same year, the rebellious son of Aurangzeb, Akbar, fled south and took shelter of Dharmaveer student Sambhaji Maharaj
 akele mogul, portuguese, angrez tathaa anya shatruon ke saath ladane ke saath hi unhen antargat shatruonse bhi ladanaa padaa
 Rajaram Samarthakone, who failed to make Rajaram as Chhatrapati, wrote a letter requesting Aurangzeb's son Akbar to invade the kingdom and make it a mark of the Mughal Empire
 kintu dharmaveer chhatrapati shri sambhaji maharaj ke parakram se parichit or unka ashrith hone ke kaaran akbar ne vah patr chhatrapati sambhaji ko bhej diya
 Enraged by this treason, Chhatrapati Srisambhaji Maharaj gave death sentence to his feudatories
 tathaapi un main se ek balaji aavji naamak samant kii samadhi bhi unhone banaayin jinke maafi kaa patr chhatrapati sambhaji ko un samant ke mrityu pashchaat mila
 In 1683 he defeated the Portuguese
 isi samay vah kisi rajkeey kaaran se sangameshwar main rahe the
 The day he was about to leave for Rayagada, on the same day some gramasthas wanted to accuse him of his problem
 jiske chalate chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj ne apane saath keval 200 sainik rakh ke baaki sena ko raigarh bhej diya
 At the same time, one of his friends, whom he had refused to give, was sent by Mughal chieftain Mukarb Khan with an army of 5000 by secret route
 yah vah rasta tha jo sirf maraathon ko pataa tha
 Therefore Sambhaji Maharaj never felt that the enemy could come from this
 unhone ladane kaa prayaas kiya kintu itani badi fuj ke saamne 200 sainikon kaa pratikaar kaam kar na paaya or apane mitra tathaa ekmaatr salaahkaar kavikalash ke saath vah bandi bana liye gaye 
 Aurangzeb got the tongue of both of them, threw his eyes out
 11 march 1689 hindu navvarsh din ko donon ke sharir ke tukde kar ke aurangzeb ne hatya kar di
 But it is said that before the murder Aurangzeb told Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj that if one of my 4 sons was like you, then the whole of Hindustan would have been merged in the Mughal Sultanate
 jab chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj ke tukde tulapur kii nadi main phenken gaye to us kinare rahane vaale logon ne wo ikaitha kar ke sila ke jod die jis ke uparaant unka vidhipurvak antyasanskaar kiya
 Aurangzeb thought that the Marathi empire would end with the death of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj
 chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj ke hatya kii vajah se saare maratha ek saath aakar ladane lage
 Therefore Aurangzeb had to die in the Deccan itself
 uskaa dakkhan jeetne kaa sapana isi bhoomi main dafan ho gaya
 Despite being such a courageous and good ruler, due to less knowledge, his character is shown as a characterless and addictive king
 yah kaaphi achambhe kii baat he ke chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj ke bare main likhi gayi bate ye unke mrityu ke pashchaat 100 saal guzarane par likhi gayi, sambhaji maharaj or aurangzeb kaa sangharsh satta kaa sangharsh tha
 This sacrifice of Shri Sambhaji Maharaj, Dharmveer student, and the work of tormenting them, the Mughals kept on moving for a month at the behest of Aurangzeb and tortured them all the time and finally killed him by breaking his legs from neck to neck
 Before all this happened, Krurkarma and Dharmandha Aurang had asked them to renounce their Hindu religion and adopt the Muslim religion of the Mughals, but the son of the erstwhile Hindu king Chhatrapati Sri Shivajiraj and keep full devotion and devotion to his Hindu religion
 The decision to not accept Islam at all was told to Aurang
 In this anger, Aurangzeb had beaten him all over the entire month
 This whole month, Shree Shivpratisthan Hindusthan From the name of the organization, in the country of India, where the work of this organization is there, the devotion of this Dharmveer Chhatrapati Shri Sambhajirajen was completely followed

 sar izac newton england ke ek vaigyanik the
 Who discovered the law of gravity and the principle of motion
 ve ek mahaan ganitagya, bhautik vaigyanik, jyotish evam darshanik the
 His research form "mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy" was published in 1687, in which the laws of universal gravitation and motion were explained and thus laid the foundation of sustainable physics
 unki philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica, 1687 main prakashit hui, yah vigyaan ke itihaas main apane aap main sabase prabhaavshaalee pustak he, jo adhikansh saahitiyik yantriki ke liye aadharbhoot kaary kii bhoomika nibhaati he
 In this work, Newton described three laws of universal gravitation and motion that dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries
 newton ne darshaya ki prithvi par vastuon kii gati or akashiya pindon kii gati kaa niyantran prakritik niyamon ke samaan samucchy ke dwaara hota he, ise darshane ke liye unhone grahiy gati ke kepler ke niyamon tathaa apane gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke bich nirantarata sthapit kii, is prakaar se surya kendriyata or vaigyanik kranti ke aadhunikeekaran ke bare main pichley andeh ko dur kiya
 In mechanics, Newton established the principles of conservation of both momentum and angular momentum
 prakaashiki main, unhone pehla vyavhaarik paravarti doordarshee banaaya or is aadhaar par rang kaa siddhant viksit kiya ki ek prism shwet prakaash ko kai rangon main apaghatit kar detaa he jo drishy spectrum banaate hai
 He gave the rule of cooling and studied the speed of sound
 ganit main, avkalan or samakalan kalan ke vikaas kaa shrey gotfrid libanij ke saath newton ko jaataa he
 He also demonstrated the generalized binomial theorem and developed the so-called "newton's method" for the approximation of zeros of a function and contributed to the study of power series
 vaigyanikon ke bich newton kii sthiti bahut sheersh pad par he, aisa britain kii royal socity main 2005 main hue vaigyanikon ke ek surveykshan ke dwaara pradarshit hota he, jisamen poocha gaya ki vigyaan ke itihaas par kiskaa prabhaav adhik gaharaa he, newton kaa yaa albert oinstin kaa
 Newton was found to be more effective in this survey

 Isaac Newton was born on 4 January 1643, old style and new style dates | OS]]: 25 December 1642] in Woolsthorpe Manor in woolsthorpe-by-kolsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire
 newton ke janm ke samay, england ne grigorian calendar ko nahin apanaaya tha or isliye unke janm kii tithi ko christmas diwas 25 disambar1642 ke rup main darj kiya gaya
 Newton was born three months after his father's death, he was a prosperous farmer and his name was Isaac Newton
 purv paripakv avasthaa main paidaa hone vaala vah ek chota balak tha; unki mata hanna askf kaa kahana tha ki vah ek chauthai gaylen jaise chote se mag main samaa saktaa tha
 When Newton was three, her mother remarried and moved to live with her new husband, Reverend Barnabus Smith, leaving her son in the care of her grandmother, Margerie Esqf
 The younger Isaac did not like his stepfather
 And had a sense of enmity with his mother for marrying her
 jaisaa ki 19 varsh tak kii aayu main unke dwaara kiye gaye aparaadhon kii suchi main pradarshit hota he: "maine mata or pita smith ke ghar ko jalaane kii dhamkee di
" From the age of twelve to the age of seventeen, he was educated at The King's School, Grantham
 He was expelled from school and in October 1659 he moved to woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth, where his mother, who was widowed for the second time, gave him Insisted on making farmers
 vah kheti se nafrat karte the
 Master Henry Stokes of King's School asked his mother to send him back to school so that he could complete his education
 skool ke ek ladke ke khilaaf badla lene kii ichha se prerit hone kii vajah se ve ek sheersh kram ke chaatr ban gaye
 In June 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge as a sizar — a kind of work-study role
 us samay college kii shikshaayen arastu par aadhaarit thim
 But Newton wanted to read the ideas of more modern philosophers such as Descartes and astronomers such as Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler
 1665 main unhone samanyikrut dwipad prameya kii khoj kii or ek ganitiya siddhant viksit karnaa shuru kiya jo baad main atyalp kalan ke naam se janaa gaya
 As soon as Newton received his degree in August 1665, the university was closed as a precaution to avoid the horrific epidemic of plague
 Although he was not distinguished as a Cambridge student, the following two years He studied privately at his home in Woolsthorpe and developed his theories on calculus, optics and the laws of gravity
 1667 main vah trinity ke ek phelo ke rup main cambridge laut aae
 Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed the least calculus independently using their own unique notations
 newton ke aantarik chakra ke anusaar, newton ne apni is vidhi ko libanij se kai saal pehle hi viksit kar diya tha, lekin unhone lagbhag 1693 tak apane kisi bhi kaary ko prakashit nahin kiya or 1704 tak apane kaary kaa puraa lekha jokha nahin diya
 is bich, libanij ne 1684 main apni vidhiyon kaa puraa lekha jokha prakashit karnaa shuru kar diya
 iske alaava, libanij ke sanketanon tathaa "avkalan kii vidhiyon" ko mahadweep par saarvatrik rup se apanaaya gaya or 1820 ke baad, british samrajya main bhi ise apanaaya gaya
 While Leibniz's pamphlets reflect the modernization of ideas from early stages to maturity, Newton's known notes have only the final result
 newton ne kaha ki ve apane kalan ko prakashit nahin karnaa chaahate the kyonki unhen dar tha ve uphaas kaa paatr ban jaayenge
 Newton had a very close relationship with the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fátio de Duillier, who had been heavily influenced by Newton's theory of gravitation since the beginning
 1691 main duiliar ne newton ke philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica ke ek nae sanskaran ko taiyaar karne kii yojana banaayi, lekin ise kabhi puraa nahin kar paae
baharhaal, in donon purushon ke bich sambandh 1693 main badal gaya
 At this time, Duillier also exchanged several letters with Leibniz
 1699 kii shuruyaat main, royal socity ke anya sadasyon ne libanij par saahitiyik chori ke aarope lagaaye or yah vivaad 1711 main purna rup se saamne aayaa
 a study by the Royal Society of Newton declared that Newton was the true inventor and that Leibniz had committed fraud
 yah adhyayan andeh ke ghere main aa gaya, jab baad paaya gaya ki newton ne khud libanij par adhyayan ke nishkarsh kii tippanee likhi
 Thus began the bitter Newton v
 Leibniz dispute, which continued in the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the death of Leibniz in 1716
 newton ko aam taur par samanyikrut dwipad prameya kaa shrey diya jaataa he, jo kisi bhi ghaat ke liye maanya he
 He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, graded cubic plane curves, made significant contributions to the theory of finite differences, he was the first to use fractional indices and the use of coordinate geometry to derive the solution of diophenatin equations
 did
 unhone laghuganak ke dwaara haraatmak shredhi ke aanshik yoga kaa sanniktan kiya, or ve pehle vyakti the jinhone aatmavishvaas ke saath ghaat shrinkhalaa kaa prayog kiya or ghaat shrinkhalaa kaa vilom kiya
 In 1669 he was elected a Lucasian Professor of Mathematics
 un dinon, cambridge yaa oxford ke kisi bhi sadsy ko ek nirdisht angreji pujari hona aavashyak tha
 However, the Lukesian professor was not required to be active in the church
 newton ne tark diya ki samanvay kii aavashyaktaa se unhen mukt rakhana chahie or charles dwitiya, jisaki anumati anivaary thi, ne is tark ko sweekaar kiya
 Thus a conflict arose between Newton's religious views and the English orthodoxy
 1670 se 1672 tak, newton kaa prakaashiki par vyaakhyaan diya
 is avadhi ke dauraan unhone prakaash ke apvartan kii khoj kii, unhone pradarshit kiya ki ek prism shwet prakaash ko rangon ke ek spectrum main viyojit kar detaa he or ek lens or ek doosraa prism bahuvarni spectrum ko sanyojit kar ke shwet prakaash kaa nirmaan karata he
 He also showed that the separation of colored light and shining on different objects does not change the properties of the colored light
 newton ne varnit kiya ki chaahe yah paravartit ho, yaa vikirit ho yaa sancharit ho, yah samaan rang kaa bana rahata he
 Thus, he observed that color is the result of the interaction of an object with already colored light, rather than the objects themselves producing colors
 yah newton ke rang siddhant ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 From this work he concluded that, the lens of any refractory telescope would experience diffusion in the colors of light, and to prove this concept, he constructed a telescope, using a mirror as an object, so that The problem can be solved
 Indeed, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involves shaping technology and solving the problem of an appropriate mirror material, according to the design of the design
 newton ne atyadhik paravartak veekshak dhaatu ke ek custom sanghathan se, apane darpan ko aadhaar diya, iske liye unke doordarshee hetu prakaashiki ki gunvattta kii jaanch ke liye newton ke chhallon kaa prayog kiya gaya
 By February 1669 he was able to produce an instrument without chromatic aberration
 1671 main royal socity ne unhen unke paravarti doordarshee ko prardashit karne ke liye kaha
 His interest encouraged him to publish his observations on color, which he later elaborated on as his optics
 jab robert hook ne newton ke kuch vichaaron kii aalochana kii, newton itnaa naaraaz hue ki ve saarvajanik bahes se baahar ho gaye
 Both remained enemies until Hook's death
 newton ne tark diya ki prakaash kanon yaa atisuksham kanon se bana he, jo saghan madhyam kii or jate samay apavartit ho jate hai, lekin prakaash ke vivartan ko spasht karne ke liye ise tarangon ke saath sambandhit karnaa jaruri tha
 
 Later physicists supported a pure wave-like explanation for the diffraction of light
 aaj kii kwantem yantriki, photone or tarang-kan yugmata ke vichaar, newton kii prakaash ke bare main samaj ke saath bahut kam samanta rakhte hai
 In his vision of light in 1675, Newton approved the presence of ether to transfer forces between particles
 brahm vidyavadi henry mor ke sampark main aane se rasayan vidya main unki ruchi punerjeevit ho gayi
 They replaced ether with occult forces based on airborne ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles
 John Maynard Keynes, who accepted many of Newton's writings on alchemy, states that "newton was not the first of the era of reason: he was the last of the magicians
 " rasayan vidya main newton kii ruchi unke vigyaan main yogadan se alag nahin kii ja sakati he
 If he had not relied on the secret idea of action at a distance through a vacuum, he would not have developed his theory of gravity
 1704 main newton ne optics ko prakashit kiya, jisamen unhone apane prakaash ke atisookshm kanon ke siddhant kii vistaar se vyakhya kii
unhone prakaash ko bahut hi sookshm kanon se bana hua mana, jabaki saadhaaran dravya bade kanon se bana hota he or unhone kaha ki ek prakaar ke rasinic roopantaran ke madhyam se "sakal nikaay or prakaash ek duusare main roopantarit nahin ho sakate hai, xxrep 7 
 or nikaay, prakaash ke kanon se apni gatividhi ke adhikansh bhaag ko praapt nahin kar sakate, jo unke sanghathan main pravesh karti he?" newton ne ek kaanch ke globe kaa prayog karte hue, ek gharshan vidyut sthitik janarator ke ek aadya rup kaa nirmaan kiya
 In 1677, Newton again began his work on mechanics, that is, with reference to Kepler's laws of gravity and planetary motion, the effect of gravity on the orbit of the planets and Hook and Flemsteed's consultation on the subject
 unhone jiram main di motu corporam main apane parinaamon kaa prakaashan kiya
 It was the introduction of the laws of motion that informed the Principia
 philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica kaa prakaashan edmund heli kii vittiya madad or protsaahan se 5 july 1687 ko hua
 In this work Newton gave three universal laws of motion in which no improvement has been made for more than 200 years
 unhone us prabhaav ke liye latin shabd gravitas kaa istemaal kiya jise gurutv ke naam se janaa jaataa he or saarvatrik gurutvkarshan ke niyam ko paribhaashit kiya
 In this work, he presented the first analytical proof of the speed of sound in air, based on Boyle's law
 bahut adhik duuri par kriya kar sakane vaale ek adrishy bal kii newton kii avadharana kii vajah se unki aalochana hui, kyonki unhone vigyaan main "gupt agenciyon" ko mila diya tha
 With the Principia, Newton gained international fame
 He received much acclaim, being an admirer of his, Switzerland-born Nicolas Fatio de Daulier, with whom he had a deep relationship, which ended in 1693 when Newton suffered from nerve blockages
 1690 ke dashak main, newton ne kai dharmik shodh likhe jo bible kii saahitiyik vyakhya se sambandhit the
 Henry More's belief in the universe and his rejection of Cartesian dualism probably influenced Newton's religious views
 unhone ek pandulipi jon loke ko bheji jisamen unhone trinity ke astitv ko vivaadit mana tha, jise kabhi prakashit nahin kiya gaya
 Subsequent works - The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended and Observations on the Professions of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St
 John - were published after his death
 unhone rasayan vidya ke liye bhi apana bahut adhik samay diya 
 Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England from 1689 to 1690 and in 1701
 But according to some details his comments were always about a cold drought in the vault and he requested to close the window
 1696 main newton shahi taksaal ke warden kaa pad sanbhaalane ke liye landan chale gaye, yah pad unhen rajkosh ke tatkaaleen kuladhipati, helifax ke pehle arl, charles montagu ke sangrakshan ke madhyam se praapt hua
 He took over as the chief currency mover of England, somehow dancing at the behest of Master Lucas
 1699 main lucas kii mrityu newton shaayad taksaal ke sabase prasiddh master bane, is pad par newton apni mrityu tak bane rahe
ye niyuktiyaan daayitvaheen pad ke rup main lee gayin thim, lekin newton ne unhen gambhirtha se liya, 1701 main apane cambridge ke kartavyon se sevanivruth ho gaye or mudra main sudhaar laane kaa prayaas kiya tathaa kataranon tathaa nakli mudra banane waalon ko apni shakti kaa prayog karke sajaa di
 In "la of Queen Anne" as master of the mint in 1717, Newton inadvertently established the pound sterling from the silver standard to the gold standard, establishing a metallic relationship between silver money and gold coins in favor of gold

 Newton was made president of the Royal Society in 1703 and an associate of the French Academic des Sciences
 royal sosayadi main apane pad par rahete hue, newton ne royal khagolvid jon flemustid ko shatru bana liya, unhone flemustid kii historica cholestis britanika ko samay se pehle hi prakashit karvaa diya, jise newton ne apane adhyayan main kaam main liya tha
 In April 1705, Queen Anne knighted Newton during a royal visit at Trinity College, Cambridge
 yah nite kii padavi newton ko taksaal ke master ke rup main apni sevaao ke liye nahin di gayi thi or na hi unke vaigyanik kaary ke liye di gayi thi balki unhen yah oopaadhi may 1705 main sansadeey chunaav ke dauraan unke rajanithik yogadan ke liye di gayi thi
 Newton died in London on 31 March 1727, and was buried in Westminster Abbey
 unki aadhi-bhatiji, catherine barton konduit, ne landan main jarmin street main unke ghar par saamaajik maamalon main unki paricharika kaa kaam kiya; ve uske "bahut pyaare ankal" the, aisa zikr unke us patr main kiya gaya he jo newton ke dwaara use tab likhaa gaya jab vah chechak kii beemaari se ubar rahi thi
 In his final years, Newton, who had no children, took over most of his property by his relatives and died intestate
 unki mrityu ke baad, newton ke sharir main baari maatra main paara paaya gaya, jo shaayad unke rasinic vyavsaay kaa parinaam tha
 Mercury poisoning may explain the eccentricities in Newton's last life
 french ganitagya joseph louis lagrange aksar kehete the ki newton mahanatam pratibhashali tha or ek baar unhone kaha ki vah "sabase zyada bhaagyashaalee bhi tha kyonki ham duniya kii pranali ko ek se zyada baar sthapit nahin kar sakate
" angreji kavi alexander pope ne newton kii uplabdhiyon ke dwaara prabhavit hokar prasiddh smriti-lekh likhaa: Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night; God said "let Newton be" and all was light
 Newton himself was hesitant to state his achievements, writing in a letter to Robert Hooke in February 1676: If i have seen further it is by standing on ye shoulders of Giants Although historians generally believe that the above lines were an attack on Hook, other than - or rather than - a statement made with humility
 At that time there was a dispute between the two about the optical discoveries
 baad kii vyakhya uski khojon par kai anya vivaadon ke saath bhi upyukt he, jaisaa ki yah prashn ki kalan kii khoj kisne kii, jaisaa ki upar bataaya gaya he
 Later in history, Newton wrote: main nahin jaanata ki main duniya ko kis rup main dikhaai duungaa lekin apane aap ke liye main ek aisa ladkaa hoon jo samudr ke kinare par khel rahaa he or apane dhyaan ko ab or tab main laga rahaa he, ek adhik chikna pathar yaa ek adhik sundar khol dhundne kii koshish kar rahaa he, sachai kaa yah itnaa bada samudr mere saamne ab tak khoja nahin gaya he
 Newton's memorial can be seen at Westminster Abbey, just north of the entrance to the choir opposite the choir screen
 ise murtikar maaikel rigbrake ne safed or dhoosar sangemarmar main banaaya he, jiskaa dizin vaastukar wiliam kaint dwaara banaaya gaya he
 In this memorial, Newton's figure rests on a stone tomb, his right elbow resting on several of his great books, and his left hand pointing to a catalog containing a mathematical design

 God controls everything and knows what is and what can be done
 " His scientific fame is notable, as well as his early church pastors and study of the Bible
 newton ne shabdic aalochana par likhaa, sabase vishesh he
 An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruption of Scripture unhone 3 april i
 33 ko yishu messiah kaa krusaropan bhi kiya, jo ek paaramparik rup se sweekrut tarikh ke saath sahamat he
 They tried unsuccessfully to find hidden messages within the Bible
 unke apane jeevankaal main, newton ne prakritik vigyaan se adhik dharm ke bare main likhaa
vah tarkyukt vishwavyaapee duniya main vishwaas karte the, lekin unhone libanij or baruch spinoja main nihit hilosoism ko asweekaar kar diya
is prakaar, aadeshit or gatisheel rup se suchit brahmand ko samajha ja saktaa tha or ise ek sakriy kaaran ke dwaara samajha janaa chahie
unke patrachaar main, newton ne daawa kiya ki princepia main likhte samay "maine ek najar aise siddhanton par rakhi, taaki devtaa main vishwaas rakhte hue manushya par vichaar kiya ja sake
" unhone duniya kii pranali main dizin kaa pramaan dekha: grahiy pranali main aisi adbhut ekarupata ko pasand ke prabhaav kii anumati di jaani chahie
 " lekin newton ne jor diya ki asthayitv kii dhimi vruddhi ke kaaran daivi hastkshep ant main pranali ke sudhaar ke liye aavashyak hoga
 iske liye libanij Condemned him: "almighty God wants to end his watch from time to time: otherwise it will be stopped to move
 It seems that he did not have enough foresight to make it a perpetual motion
" " Newton's position was strictly defended through a famous correspondence by his follower Samuel Clarke
 newton or robert boyal ke yantric darshan ko buddhijivi kalamaghasit dwaara rudhiwaadiyon or utsaahiyon ke liye ek vyavhaarya vikalp ke rup main padonnat kiya gaya or ise roodhiwaadee prachaarkon tathaa asantusht prachaarkon jaise letitudinerian ke dwaara hichkichaakar sweekaar kiya gaya
 Thus, the clarity and ingenuity of science were seen as a way to counter the emotional and spiritual exaggeration of both the threat of atheism and superstitious zeal, and at the same time, a second wave of English divinity led to Newton's discoveries
 Used to demonstrate the possibility of a "natural religion"
 purv-atmagyaan ke khilaaf kiye gaye hamale "jaadui soch," or isaiyat ke rahasyamayi tatv, ko brahmand ke bare main boyal kii yantric avadharana se neenv mili
 newton ne ganitiya pramaanon ke madhyam se boyal ke vichaaron ko purna banaaya or shaayad adhik mahatvapurn rup se ve unhen lokapriy banane main bahut adhik safal hue
 newton ne ek hastkshep bhagwaan dwaara niyantrit duniya ko ek aisi duniya main badal daalaa jo tarksangat or saarvbhaumik siddhanton ke saath bhagwaan ke dwaara kalatmak rup se banaayin gayi he
 These principles are available for all people to discover, they allow people to fulfill their objectives fruitfully in this life, do not wait for the next life and make them full of their own rational powers
 newton ne bhagwaan ko mukhya nirmaataa ke rup main dekha, jiske astitv ko sabhi nirmaanon kii bhavyata ke chehre main nakaara nahin ja saktaa he
 His spokesman, Clarke, disapproved of Leibniz's theology, which freed God from the responsibility of "l'origine du mal", removing God from contributing to his creation, as Clarke said
 Was such a deity would be king by name only, but would be one step away from atheism
 But the undiscovered theological result of the success of Newton's system in the next century would reinforce the position of theism revealed by Leibniz
 duniya ke bare main samaj ab saadhaaran maanav ke kaaran ke str tak aa gayi or maanav, jaisaa ki odo mercward ne tark diya, buraai ke sudhaar or unmoolan ke liye uttaradaayi ban gaya
 On the other hand, the results of the ideas of the Late Latinian and Newtonian were far-reaching, a religious faction devoted to the concept of the mechanical universe, but with the same zeal and mystery that the Enlightenment struggled hard to destroy
 ek pandulipi jo unhone 1704 main likhi, jisame unhone bible se vaigyanik jaankaree nikaalane ke apane prayaas kaa varnan kiya he, unka anumaan tha ki duniya 2060 se pehle samaapt nahin hogi
 In this prophecy, he said, "it does not say what the final time will be, but i want to stop speculation about imaginary individuals who often make predictions about the end times and fail this prediction
" Holy prophecy is discredited upon leaving
 " Enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of earlier scientists — Galileo, Boyle, and primarily Newton — as guiding and guaranteeing their application of the single concept of natural law and nature to every physical and social field of election day
 Gone
 is sambandh main, is par nirmit saamaajik sanranchanaaon or itihaas ke adhyay tyaage ja sakate the
 It was Newton's conception of the universe based on natural and spiritually understandable rules that served as a seed for enlightenment ideology
 loke or waltair ne aantarik adhikaron kii vakaalat karte hue prakritik niyamon kii avadharana ko rajanithik pranali par lagu kiya; physiocrate or adam smith ne aatm-ruchi or manovigyaan kii prakritik avadharana ko aarthik pranali par lagu kiya tathaa samajashastriyon ne pragati ke prakritik namoonon main itihaas ko feet karne kii koshish ke liye tatkaaleen saamaajik vyavastha kii aalochana kii
 Monbodo and Samuel Clarke opposed elements of Newton's work, but eventually rationalized it to ensure his strong religious views about nature
 shahi taksaal ke prabandhak ke rup main, newton ne anumaan lagaaya ki dubaara dhalaai kiye jane vaale sikkon main 20% jaali the
 Fraud was a very high treason for which there was a death sentence
 is ke baavjood, sabase jwalanth aparaadhiyon ko pakadana bahut mushkil tha; yadhyapi, newton is kaary ke liye sahi sabit hue
 bhesh badal kar sharabakhaane or jail main jaakar unhone khud bahut se saboot ikatthe kiye
 English law still had ancient and formidable customs of power, to separate all branches of government and establish all obstacles to prosecution
 newton ko shanti kaa nyaayadhish banaaya gaya or june 1698 or christmas 1699 ke bich unhone gavaah, mukhabiron or sandigdhon ke 200 parikshan karwaae
 Newton won his commitment and in February 1699 he had ten prisoners awaiting release
 raja ke vakil ke rup main newton kaa ek maamla wiliam chaloner ke khilaaf tha
 Chaloner's plan was to set up a fake conspiracy of Catholics and then turn them into hapless conspirators whom he held hostage
 chaloner ne apane aap ko paryaapt samrudh sajjan bana liya
 While applying in Parliament, the Chaloner also provided equipment for making fake coins in the mint
 He proposed that he be allowed to inspect the mint processes so that he could do something to improve it
 usne sansad main arji di ki sikkon kii dhalaai ke liye uski yojana ko sweekaar kar liya jaye taaki jaalsaji na kii ja sake, jabaki usee samay jaali sikke saamne aaye
 Newton tested cheating on Chaloner and in September 1697 sent him to New Gate Prison
 lekin chalonor ke ucch sthanon par mitra the, jinhone use uski rihaai ke liye madad kii
 Newton tested it for the second time with conclusive evidence
 chaloner ko ucch rajdroh kaa doshi paaya gaya tha or use 23 march 1699 ko tiburn gelos main faansee de kar dafna diya gaya
 According to Newton's first law, an object which is in steady state will remain constant and an object which is in the same state of motion will move in the same direction with the same speed until an external force acts on it
 newton ke duusare niyam ke anusaar ek vastu par lagaaya gaya bal f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} \ vec{, samay ke saath iske samveg p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} \ vec{ main parivartan kii dar ke baraabar hota he
 In mathematical terms it can be expressed as follows chunki doosraa niyam ek sthir dravyaman kii vastu par lagu hota he,, pehla pad lupt ho jaataa he or twaran kii paribhaasha kaa upyog karte hue pratisthaapan ke dwaara sameekaran ko sanketon ke rup main nimnanusaar likhaa ja saktaa he The first and second laws represent the breaking of Aristotle's physics, in which it was believed that a force was necessary to maintain motion
 ve rajya main vyavastha kii gati kaa ek uddeshy he rajya badalane ke liye hai ki ek hi shakti kii jarurat he
 The SI unit of force is named Newton in honor of Newton
 newton ke tisare niyam ke anusaar prayek kriya kii baraabar or vipareet pratikriya hoti he
 This means that whenever one object exerts a force on another object then the second object exerts the same force on the first object in the opposite direction
 iskaa ek saamaanya udahaaran he do aais skates ek duusare ke vipareet khiskate hai to vipareet dishaao main khisakane lagate hai
 Another example is the backward thrust of the gun, in which the force exerted by the gun to fire the bullet exerts an equal and opposite force on the gun which the gunner feels
 chunki prashn main jo vasteen hai, aisa jaruri nahin ki unka dravyaman baraabar ho, isliye donon vastuon kaa parinami twaran alag ho saktaa he 
 Unlike Aristotle, Newton's physics has become universal
 udhaaharan ke liye, doosraa niyam grahon tathaa ek girte hue pathar par bhi lagu hota he
 The vector nature of the second law establishes a geometric relationship between the direction of force and the type of change in momentum of the object
 newton se pehle, aam taur par yah mana jaataa tha ki surya ke chaaron or ghurnan kar rahe ek grah ke liye ek agragami bal aavashyak hota he jisaki vajah se yah gati karata rahata he
 Newton showed that instead of this, an attraction force inside the Sun is required
 yahan tak ki princepia ke prakaashan ke kai dashakon ke baad bhi, yah vichaar saarvatrik rup se sweekrut nahin kiya gaya
 And many scientists preferred Descartes's theory of Vorticas
 newton aksar khud ek kahani kehete the ki ek ped se ek girte hue seb ko dekh kar ve gurutvkarshan kaa siddhant banane ke liye prerit ho paae
 Later cartoons were made to satirize where the apple was seen falling on Newton's head and it was demonstrated that its influence somehow introduced Newton to the force of gravity
 His booklets showed that in the late 1660s Newton's idea that terrestrial gravity expanded, it was inversely proportional to the square of the moon; However, it took him two decades to develop the complete theory
 jon kanadyuit, jo royal taksaal main newton ke sahyogi the or newton kii bhatiji ke pati bhi the, ne is ghatana kaa varnan kiya jab unhone newton ke jivan ke bare main likhaa: In 1666 he retired from Cambridge again and moved to Lincolnshire near his mother
 jab ve ek baag main gum rahe the tab unhen ek vichaar aayaa ki gurutv kii shakti dharti se ek nishchit duuri tak simit nahin he, lekin yah shakti usase kahin zyada aage vistrut ho sakati he jitna ki pehle aam taur par sochaa jaataa tha
 He told himself whether it would be as high as the moon and if so, it would affect his speed and possibly keep it in its orbit, what was the effect of the logic they were calculating
 
 sawaal gurutv ke astitv kaa nahin tha balki yah tha ki kya yah bal itnaa vistrut he ki yah chaand ko apni kaksha main banaaye rakhane ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Newton showed that if the force decreases in square inverse of distance, the lunar orbital period can be calculated and a good result can be obtained
 unhone anumaan lagaaya ki yahi bal anya kakshiya gati ke liye jimmedaar he or isiilie ise saarvatrik gurutvkarshan kaa naam de diya
 William Stukele, a contemporary writer, recounts the life of Sir Isaac Newton in his memory, recalling a conversation he had with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726, when Newton mentioned that "the idea of gravity in his mind When did it come first? jab vah dhyaan kii mudra main baithe the usee samay ek seb ke girane ke kaaran aisa hua
 Why does this apple always fall perpendicular to the ground? He thought so in himself
 yah bagal main yaa upar kii ore kyon nahin jaataa he, balki hameshaa prithvi ke centre kii ore hi girtaa he
 "in similar terms, Voltaire wrote in an essay on epic poetry," Sir Isaac Newton was wandering in his gardens, looking at an apple falling from a tree, he first thought of the system of gravity
 vibhinn pedo ko "vah" seb ke ped hone kaa daawa kiya jaataa he jiskaa newton ne varnan kiya he
 The King's School, Grantham, claims that the tree was purchased by the school, and after a few years it was brought down with roots and planted in the headmaster's garden
 neshnal trust jo woolsthrope menor kaa maalik he, kaa vartmaan staff is par vivaad karata he, ore daawa karata he ki vah ped unke bageeche main upasthit he jis ke bare main newton ne baat kii
 a descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room in which Newton lived while studying
 brogdel main rashtriya falon kaa sangrah un pedo se grapht kii aapurti kar saktaa he, jo flower of kent ke samaan dikhaai detaa he, jo ek mote goode kii pakaane kii kism he
