 Baker was given the task of planning two secretariats built next to this building

 Lutyens considered the controversy to be Bakerloo's level
 lekin bharpoor prayaas ke baavjood ise badalawa nahin paaya
 He wanted the road to come down from the building to a long slope, so that the view of the building is not obstructed, and the view from far away
 san 1914 main baker or lootyans sahit bani ek samiti man tay hua, ki sadak kii dhaal 25 main 1 ho, jo baad main keval 22 main 1 bani
 a more steep gradient would further disrupt the view of the building
 lootyans yah jaanata tha, ki yah dhaal bhi iske drishy ko purnataya nahin dikhaa paayegi
 Then he requested to reduce it
 san 1916 main imperial dilli samiti ne lootyans ke is prastaav ko radd kar diya
 Lutyens still understood that Baker was more involved in appeasing the government and making money, rather than focusing on a good-grade architectural design
