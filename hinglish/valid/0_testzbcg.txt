 Sensation or sense perception is the physical abilities from which knowledge gained makes an organism aware of its environment
 manushyon main paanch pramukh samvedi ang hai- dekhnaa, sunanaa, choona, soonghnaa or swaad lenaa 
 But in addition to these humans also have the ability to accept many sensations, such as heat etc
 anya jaanwaron main alag indriyabodh hote hai, jise kii kuch machhliyon main pani ke dabaav ke liye indriyaan hoti he jinase ve aaraam se bataa paati hai ke aasapaas koi anya machhlee hill rahi he ke nahin
 Some other animals can detect changes in the electromagnetic or magnetic fields in the water - or are very beneficial for hunting because every other organism influences the electric field around them
 jaise hi indriyaan apane vaataavaran main kisi cheez ke bare main gyaan praapt kar leti hai, us vastu kaa shaareerik rup se "indriyabodh" ho jaataa he
 Now the brain has not figured out its meaning
 mastishk kii kuch aisi chotein or rog hoten hai jinamein kisi vyakti ko chijen to dikhti hai lekin unka bodh nahin ho paata
 In a disease called "visual agnozia", a person can see and describe something but does not recognize it, such as seeing a horse is able to make an exact picture of it by hand but does not recognize that it is a horse
 kaaran yah he ki in vyaktiyon main indriyabodh to bilkul thik hota he lekin avgam kii prakriya main kuch samasya hui hoti he
 Manoj Das is a literary writer honored with Saraswati honor
 unki kritiyaan oriya or angreji main hai
 Manoj Das is the leading storyteller of the late twentieth century of Odia literature
 unki pehali kahani ‘samudrar kshudha’ 1947 main prakashit hui thi
 Although in the early days he has written poetry, travel story and Ramichana, but his main mode of literary practice is story and he is particularly familiar as a storyteller
 san 1971 main prakashit ‘manoj dasank katha o
 kahani’ main unki tab tak likhi kahaniyaan thim or manoj das ko orissa ke ek agrani kathakaar ke rup main sweekruti mil chuki thi
 Even after this, many other collections of his have been published: 'lakshmir Abhisar', 'abu Purush', 'dhumabha Digant', etc
 vah oriya tathaa angreji donon bhashaaon ke kahanikar hai
 Even as an English writer, he is acknowledged on all India basis and his English stories have been highly acclaimed
 prakhyat lekhak graham green ne unhen aar
 ke
 narayan ke saath rakhkar dekha he
 Someone else Hardy, Saki and O
 Has compared him to Henry
 unke apane vichaar main ve kuch kahani pehle oriya main likhte hai or kuch pehle angreji main
 Later they write that story again in another language
 kis bhashaa main ve sochate hai, is prashn par manoj das kaa jawaab he ki vah sochate hai neerav kii bhashaa main
 Writing in English, Manoj Das is not the original source of his literary creation, either English or foreign literature
 unki kahani main jis parampara kaa vikaas dekhne ko miltaa he, vah he sanskrit tathaa oriya kii lokkatha, veda, upanishad kii bhartiya saanskrithik dhara or aadhunik oriya gadhy sahitya ke pravartak faqir mohan senapati
 Manoj Das himself has acknowledged the influence of Faqir Mohan, Somdev, Vishnu Sharma etc
 on his writing
 sahitya ke kshetra main manoj das ko kaafii safalataa bhi mili
 Among the honors he received in the field of literature are Odisha Sahitya Akademi Award, Central Sahitya Akademi Award, Sarala Award and Equinox Award
 inke saath hi inhen praapt hua he anginat pathakon kaa akunthit samarthan
 The qualities that made his stories dear to both critics and readers are the strong plot, seductive and fluent narration, the mystical fictional atmosphere and finally a latent intent and moral meaning
 manojdas kii praarambhik kahaniyon se lekar ab tak likhi jane vaali kahaniyon main ye saare gun nishchit rup se dekhe ja sakate hai
 And for all these reasons it is not possible to forget his story once read it
 unki kahani kaa ek shashakt aakarshan he uski bauddhikta va bhavukta athwa hriday or man kaa santulan
 Although all their stories are steeped in ruthless intellectualism, they do not suppress intellectualism, sentimentality and impulse
 kahani ke ant main niti-shiksha kaa samaadhaan kahani ke paatro ko unki prakrutigat rosemara kii dincharya ke baahar nahin khich saktaa
 Therefore all these characters are alive and worldly, partakers of ordinary happiness and sorrow
 keval katha kehane ke dhang ke pradhan hone ke kaaran nahin, unki abhasadharmee kahaniyon main bhi yah dekha ja saktaa he in paatro ko rup dene ke liye manoj das ne jis tarah kii style apanaayi he, vah bhi unki nijee he
 His famous story 'dhumabh Digant' begins like this: kabhi-kabhi dur hawa main aasmaan main pakshiyon ko kilbilaate dekh behad udhaas ho jaataa hoon
 His sense of speed at that time is felt helpless while reading any modern national poem
 or jab achaanak bawandar main kuch sookhe pattey upar kii ore udakar adrishy ho jate hai, tab aisa lagata-main bhi kahin kho gaya hoon
 But i could not understand why the thought of such a storm, birds or dried leaves came after a long time today while reading a fairy tale
 ‘‘digant ke parvat par tha ek chhipakar rahane vaala daanav’’, puri-katha main likhaa tha
 There is a mysterious question at the beginning of the story, information about the sky, the bird and the wind and then the mention of a fairytale
 maano yah kisi pariktha main ek or pariktha ho
 But this story is not lost in the mythology of the fairy tale
 kahani ke sabhi paatr rakt-maans ke he or maanviya kamajoriyon tathaa asahaayta par ashrith hai
 The speaker of the story is also a character himself
 kahani kaa vishay he hatu, naveen evam swayan vaktaa
 Many years ago, a teenager in his childhood, Bandhu had lost Lily to the mountain under compassionate conditions
 or usee kii yaad ab tak unhen ghere hue he
 The end of the story is like this- is kahani kii tarah kai anya kahaniyon main kehane vaala khud bhi kahani kaa ek paatr he
 With this style, the writer is able to convey the story directly to the reader
 iske alaava kai kahaniyon main manoj das pathakon ko sidhe sambodhit bhi karte hai
 This creates a sensitive relationship between the writer and the reader and the characters of the story draw closer to the reader
 is pariprekshya main ek or baat bhi dikhaai detii he, vah yah he ki in kahaniyon ke paatr adbhut hote hai
 Looked at from a point of view, all these are unrealistic and inappropriate - as if they are residents of some fairy-world
 parantu phir gambheertha se vichaar par karne par lagata he ki ye bilkul mitti ke hi manushya hai, jo hamaare khub qareeb aate hai
 Princes, princesses, monks and even non-human characters seem very alive
 in sab paatro ko rahasyamay tathaa alokik rup dene ke liye manoj das jis kaushal kaa sahaara lete hai, vah he paatro or sthanon kaa namakaran
 The names of many of his characters are Pundarik, Hidimb, Shankhanad, Hayagreeva
 lubhurbha parvat unki ekaadhik kahaniyon main varnit he
 These names are not only used for communication of humor, but also to make the country, era and characters mysterious
 manoj das kii bhashaa va shabd-chayan bhi us disha main sahaayak hai
 In their stories, we get "jhalak-jhalak Shubhra Auspicious", "death cover of snow stagnation", "earth from blackness and candle", "bear-bear darkness", "unhappy" Moon "," gust of wind, "etc
 shabd-vinyas pathakon ke aage ek aparthiv parivesh sristi karte hai
 In the stories of Manoj Das, the secret information is found at the beginning of the story
 kahani kaa pehla vaakya hi pathak ke man main paidaa kar detaa he ek rahasy tathaa romaanch jiske mul tatva ko hamen found hi nikaalnaa hota he kahani shuru se ant tak padhakar
 This is clear from the following first sentence of some of his stories- manoj das kii kahaniyon main pari-katha va lok-katha ke prayog ke bare main pehle hi kaha ja chukaa he
 Their word selection and description style are very helpful in giving it a shape
 kahaniyon main shabd yojana chhandamay tathaa bimb bharpoor hote hai
 The use of incompatible sentences sometimes gives the description the heat of the poem
 unki upmaayen kavitamay kavyamay hoti hai
 Some examples of such writings are - "the constellations looked like the eyes of dead fish", the Sun bid farewell to the newlyweds Tarun as soon as four o'clock "," The black man like Timi, black-black Wearing a wool sweater of linear clouds, moon, etc
 unke upama-bimb prayog kaa ek pratinidhi varnan unki ‘dhoomabh digant’ kahani ke nimnokt panktiyon se pataa chal saktaa he- Initially his music teacher was a few bunnies
 ve use gunagunaanaa sikhaa dene ke baad koyal ne aage kii jimmedaari lee
 It was not that the cuckoo was performing her duty only with her own cook, she used to call the girl, in a dense area of the forest, where the wind inside a cave would produce different sounds
 She was the one who used to call him soft and soft, even on the banks of the waterfall
 use akshar sikhaaya tha taaraon ne, pyaar karnaa sikhaaya tha indradhanush ne; muskaraana sikhaaya tha suryoday ne or suryaast ne sikhaaya tha vishaad
 '' ye panktiyaan shuddh kavita hai or isaki bhashaa manoj das ke praarambhik jivan ke kavita lekhan kii soochna detii he
 One thing in this language is also to see that the language is serious and classical in many places and very simple and fluent in some places
 bhashaa prayog main hota he jatil sanskrit shabdon ke saath saral graamy shabdon ke prayog kaa samanvay
 In the story role of Manoj Das, the direction which first appears before us is its sarcastic view
 kahani raajnneetik prishthbhumi kii ho yaa saamaajik samasya ko lekar, paatr raja, jamidaar yaa saadhaaran manushya hon, sabhi vyangy ke paatr hai
 The circumstances in most of the stories are also sarcastic
 jaise ki mantri kii topi ko bandar le jaataa he, doctor nirog aadmi main rog kaa pataa lagaate hai
 To save rice for the people during the drought, the landlord only eats meat
 jameendaar kii munch saaf hogi, isiilie nayak sahab headmaster, tehseeldaar sabhi chintit hai
 There is agreement in the husband and wife that if one of the two dies first, then his phantom will send the message to the other from the spot
 headmaster pati apni patni ko kisi dosha ke liye bench par khadaa hone kii sajaa detaa he
 All these funny situations are helpful in the characters with amazing names like: Professor Dhrupad, Mrs
 Hyphen, Bandar Jhandu, Ugracharan, Mr
 Tintuli, Chakori Kuturi etc
 is baat se yah siddh karnaa uchit nahin ki manoj das kii kahaniyaan keval hasya-ras pradhan hai
 Although satire has an impact in narration and approach, the stories are written with different situations, problems and characters
 kai kahaniyon main raajnneetik netaa unki vidrupata ke shikaar bane hai
 But in all these stories, they are not direct or propaganda-righteous
 maanon ek vishesh duuri par rahakar hi ve raajnneetik swaroop kaa vishleshan karte hai
 Some more stories are based on the background of the pre-independence movement
 in kahaniyon main ham pate hai jameendaar, raysahab, raja, angrej ofisar aadi ko
 The picture of Odisha's rural life has also emerged in many of his stories
 in kahaniyon main gaanv-dehaat kii jeevancharya ke alaava vahaan ke reeti-rivaaj, daridrata tathaa dayaniyata bhi saamne aati he
 Then many stories are based entirely on physical and mysterious subject matter
 kahani kii vishaywastu yaa prishthbhumi jo bhi kuch kyon na ho, prayek kahani kaa paatr safal tathaa sampoorn he, evam puri kahani ek sahaj siddhanth kii adhikari he
 Apart from this, many of his stories are plain fable or fairy tale
 niti katha par aadhaarit manoj das kii ek lambi kahani ‘abu purush’ is tarah kii kahani kaa ek utkrisht udhaaharan he- An Indian Mr
 The Abu of Sharma's head has become a perverse instrument of economic accomplishment and political victory in his business respectively

 Mr

 yahan company maalik ke saath chunaav main mi

 lekin aadhyatm vishwasi maan uske man main sadbuddhi jagaati he
 Abu is cured by the grace of the Guru
 yah bhartiya vishwaas kii ek vaastaviktaa he
 In the dream of winning this highly physical process using the election field, Mr
 Sharma wakes up
 parantu saral vishwasi maan use upadesh detii he-‘‘bete, phir kabhi aisi galati mat karnaa
 The Guru's blessing is to make you Abu-free
 yah mukti kii baat prachaar karke, bechakar phayda uthaane ke liye nahin he
 '' is kahani kaa niti-vaakya ant main maan ke munh se kahalwaya gaya he-‘‘tere is abu-mukti ke dauraan maine sapana dekha he ki sari duniya shaayad kabhi abu-tantrik raajnneeti tathaa vyavsaay se ek din mukt ho jaayegi
 "another feature of Manoj Das's stories is that since the story and background of the story belongs to any one country or period, the entire story and its essence are beyond time and space
 ye kahaniyaan kisi desh yaa samay kii ho sakati hai
 Because human laughter and primitive tendencies, jealousy, malice love-harmony, do not belong to any one country or period
 yah pehle hi kaha ja chukaa he ki manoj das kii kahaniyon kii shuruuaat ek naatakeey chamatkaarita se hoti he
 In the same way there is a strange contingency at the end of their stories
 or shuruyaat tathaa ant ke bich main hoti he ek yojanabaddh katha-vastu
 That is why it has been said about him: "it would be more appropriate to tell him a story rather than a story-writer
 uski kathan style kii vidagdh bhangima main hota he laghudharmee chapaltaa, phir ghatana kii sristi main vishwaas ke ayogy ek pratyay pathak ke man main utpann karte hue kathakaar o

 '' manoj das ke bare main ant main itnaa hi kaha ja saktaa he ki chalis saal pehle kahani lekhan prarambh karke ab tak ve lekhan main sakriy hai
 His literary contribution is very valuable and Oriya literature keeps him from many other works
 apane lekhan ke bare main manoj das ne kai saakshatkaaron main kaafii kuch kaha he

 Haridwar is very ancient as a pilgrimage but it is not very ancient as a city
 haridwar naam bhi uttar puranic kaal main hi prachlit hua he
 In the Mahabharata, it has only been called 'gangadwar'
 puraanon main ise gangadwar, mayakshetra, maayatirth, saptastrot tathaa kubjamrak ke naam se varnit kiya gaya he
 In ancient times, it was also called 'kapila' after the name of Kapilmuni
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki yahan kapil muni kaa tapovana tha
 According to mythology, Bhagiratha, who was the great-grandson of Suryavanshi King Sagara, brought Gangaji to earth after years of penance in Satyuga to save his 60,000 ancestors and free him from the curse of Kapil Rishi

 jo manushya us tirth main snaan tathaa vishesh rup se srihari ke darshan karke un kii parikrama karte hai vah dukh ke bhaagi nahin hote

 In the Vanaparva of Mahabharata, Devarshi Narada describes Yudhishthira as the 'bhishma-pulastya Dialogue' about the pilgrimage sites of India, where the pilgrimages of Gangadwar ie Haridwar and Kankhal are also mentioned

 Before the Ramayana and the Mahabharata period, Indian trade organizations not only traded to far-off countries, but they were so economically strong and socially capable, organized and powerful that it was impossible for the then heads of state to ignore them
 ramayana ke ek ullekh ke anusaar ram jab chaudaa varsh kaa vanvaas katkar ayodhya waapas lautate hai to unke swaagat ke liye aae prajajanon main shreni pramukh bhi hote hai
 In ancient texts, the fact has also been mentioned in many places that in those days, apart from the privately owned private and family businesses, there were many types of industrial and commercial organizations in the current India, whose business was extended to many remote countries
 unke kafile samudri evam maidani raaston se hokar arab or yunaan ke anek deshon se nirantar sampark banaae rahete the
 They had their own laws
 sankat se nipatane ke liye unhen apni senaayen rakhane kaa bhi adhikaar tha
 He was respected in the court of the emperor
 mahatvapurn avasaron par samraat shreni-pramukh se paraamarsh liya karata tha
 Those organizations were called by many names depending on their business area and style of work
 gana, pug, paani, vratya, sangh, nigam athwa negam, shreni jaise kai naam the, jinamein shreni sarvaadhik prachlit sangya thi
 These were all mutually supported organizations, which were called by different names depending on their working style and business
 bhartiya dharamshastron main pracheen samaaj kii aarthiki kaa bhi vishleshan kiya gaya he
 They mention that hand-crafted craftsmen, business-running castes were organized
 samuhik hiton ke liye sangathit vyapaar ko apanaakar unhone apni sooyeeboojh kaa parichay diya tha
 For this reason she was also very prosperous financially and socially
 acharya pandurang vaaman kane ne us samay ke vibhinn vyavsaayik sanghathanon kii visheshtaon kaa alag-alag varnan kiya he
 Katyayan has considered category, poog, gana, vrat, nigam and union etc
 as class or group
 1 lekin acharya kane unki is vyakhya se sahamat nahin the
 According to him all these words are old
 yahaan tak ki vaidic sahitya main bhi ye prayukt hue hai
 Although there they usually mean party or class
 2 isi prakaar kaushitkibrahman upanishad main pug ko rudra kii upama di gai he
 3 Defining the Sangh in the Apastamba Dharmasutra, looking at its functioning and future, its difference in terms of other organizations can be understood
 4 By Pannikikal, specific meanings of names like Sangh, Vrat, Gana, Pog, Nigam etc
 were beginning to be voiced
 unhone shreni ke paryaayavachi athwa vibhinn rup maane jane vaale uparyukt naamon kii vyutpatti aadi kii vistrut charchaa kii he
 We have already mentioned the fact that the reach of the categories was not limited only to economic activities, but their coverage was in all areas religious, political and social
 isliye kaaryakshetra ko dekhte hue unhen vibhinn sambodhano se pukaara janaa bhi swaabhaavik hi tha
 On the other hand it is also true that despite being called by various names like poog, vratya, nigam, category etc
, there was no clear demarcation among the supported organizations on the basis of their activities or hierarchy
 duusare shabdon main ye naam vishisht paristhitiyon main kaaryastylee evam kaaryakshetra ke anusaar apanaae to jate the, parantu unke bich spasht kaary-vibhaajan kaa abhaav tha
 Due to the different names of the organization, an attempt has been made to clarify the informal meaning between them and the prevailing meaning of their sound in the following paragraphs
 yah naam pracheen kaal se hi sangh athwa vaikalpik sarkaar ke rup main prachlit rahaa he
 The spirit of internal democracy was predominant in this
 panini ne apane mahabhashya main aise logon ko vratya mana he, jinka koi vishisht vyavsaay nahin tha, jo apane taatkaalik hiton ke liye kisi bhi prakaar kaa vyavsaay apana sakate the
 In other words, he had working knowledge of many occupations
 or samay tathaa upyogita ke anusaar ve apana koi bhi vyavsaay chun sakate the
 The Vratya often made a living by his physical strength
 ve vividh jatiyon se aae hue daksh shilpkaar the or apane aarthik hiton kii suraksha ke liye aapas main sangathit hokar rahanaa aavashyak maanate the
 Katyayan considers Vratyas to be a flock of quintessential armored soldiers
 isse kuch vibhinn vikramaditya khanna ne kiran kumaar thaplyaal evam majumdaar ke hawaale se ek hi parikshetra main rahane vaale, aarthik hiton ke liye prayasarat, samooh ko vratya evam pug kii sangya di he
 According to him- 'vratya and Pooga were groups of residents of the same town or village, generally engaged in the same business, for equal economic interests
 ’5 spasht he ki vratya samandharma log the, jinako ekaadhik vyavsaayon kii jaankaree hoti thi
 They were oriented towards the formation of a collaborative organization, not seeing favorable opportunities in their traditional enterprise
 unke sanghathan adhik loktantric or udaar hote the
 Acharya Kane has mentioned in his great book 'history of Dharmashastra' that like the Vratya, the Pugas were also people from different castes
 ve aavashyaktaa padane par mistre se lekar shramik tak, kuch bhi kaam kar sakate the
 According to Kashika, he was Dhanalupa and Kami, who had no stable occupation
 katyayan ne pug ko vyapaariyon kaa samudaay sweekaar kiya he
 Kautilya has also shown the difference between soldiers and workers at one place in his economics
 unke anusaar saurashtra evam kamboj rajya ke sainikon kii shreniyan alag-alag virgon main vibhajit thim
 Some of them were living their livelihood with the help of armaments, while some had agriculture as a means of livelihood — Pug is a community of people of different castes and different occupations in one place and the category is a community of people of different castes — like Helabukas, Tambulikas, Categories of kuvindas and tanners
 In the epigraph of Chahamana Vigraharaj, there is an account of giving one dhamma for each horse to the Helabukas
 ’6 pug sambhawatah aise vyaktiyon kaa sanghathan hota tha, jinka paitrik vyavsaay yuddh athwa sevakarm tha; arthath aise log jo varna-vibhaajan kii drushti se vaanijyakarm ke liye adhikrut nahin the
 People of the peasant and military castes, frustrated by their occupation, used to build organizations for change or for greater economic benefit
 is baat kii bhi paryaapt sambhaavna he ki vanijyik anubhav kii kami tathaa shilpakalaon ke gyaan ke abhaav main shudravarg evam sena se nikaale gaye logon ke sanghathan ko pug mana gaya ho
 aise log yudhak athwa gairavyavsaayik shreniyon ke gathan ko praathamikta dete the
 In this way, there was no significant difference from the theoretical point of view of organizations called Puga and Vratya
 sangh ko saamanytah vishisht logon ke sanghathan kaa paryaay mana gaya he
 In ancient India, there has been a tradition of calling the poles of democratic power in the name of the Union
 sanghon ke sadasyon kaa chayan bahumat ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa tha
 However, it was a limited republic
 unke sadsy praayah varnavyavastha main upar ke kram par aane vaali jatiyon se sambhddha hote the, jo apane aarthik, raajnneetik evam dharmik hiton kii prapti hetu sanghathan kaa nirmaan karte the
 This is also the meaning of Gana
 prarambh main in donon ke bich koi saidhantik vibhaajan tha bhi nahin
 prakarantar main gana or sangh main bhed avashya kiya jane laga tha
 But Gana has also been accepted as singular, while the noun of union has been reserved for a group of rational people who take their decisions in principle based on consensus
 Especially after the rise of Buddhism, the Brahmins started calling their organizations Sangh to differentiate themselves from them
 manu ne sangh kaa prayog sangathit samaaj ke liye kiya he
 Whereas according to Katyayana, the Sangha is a society of Buddhists and Jains
 da
 rameshchandra majumdaar evam da
 kiran kumaar thaplyaal, donon ne isi mat kii sanstuti kii he
 Quoting both of these, Vikramaditya Khanna writes that - 'sangh's address was generally meant for political organizations
 yadhyapi kabhi-kabhi uskaa is shabd kaa prayog shaikshik evam dharmik gatividhiyon ke vikaas ko samarpit sanghathanon, visheshkar buddha bhikshuon ke dal, ke liye bhi kar liya jaataa tha
 '7 This classification does not indicate the economic characteristics of the Union
 It may also happen that groups formed for the religious, social and political interests of Buddhists are labeled as Sangh
 But in Lokparpara, there was a trend to call the groups of traders as Sangh
 pracheen bhartiya waniumay main gana shabd kaa ullekh anekaarthi he
 Gana also refers to a cultured citizen
 gaanvon evam nagaron main saamaajik-raajnneetik vyavastha banaae rakhane ke liye, samaaj ke jin vishisht vyaktiyon ko yah jimmedaari saunpi jaati thi, unhen ‘gana’ kaha jaataa tha
 Many times, people nominated for religious and political purposes were also decorated with the noun 'gan'
 kalantar main is sangya kaa upyog aarthik uddeshyon ke gathit sanghathanon ke liye bhi kiya jane laga
 vasishtha dharmasutra main ‘gana’ kaa ullekh sangathit samaaj ke rup main kiya gaya he
 Manu has also given some similar meaning; That is, the whole society is a group or community
 katyayan ne varna-vibhaajan ko aadhaar banaakar ise or bhi visheshikrut karte hue, brahmanon ke sanghathan ko gana kii sangya di he
 According to Mitakshara, the Ganas were a group of merchants, whose main occupation was Helabook, ie horse business
 vikramaditya khanna ne gana ko dharmik evam raajnneetik sanghathan maanate hue usko sangh ke samaksh rakhaa he
 Dr
 Referencing Majumdar, he writes that- 'initially, Gana was meant to be a group of merchants, but later on they also came to be recognized as a political and religious organization
' 8 The use of Gana for the presentation of general citizenship also Valid for ordinary citizens 
 ganatantr usee shabd kii vyutpatti he
 This meaning has been accepted by scholars for millennia
 lekin yah bhi satya he ki samay ke saath sangyaaen evam unke sandarbh badalte rahete hai
 Many times even selfish people cut off their original references and make arbitrary interpretations
 aisa prathit hota he ki gana kaa upyog prarambh main naagarik or naagarik-samoohon ke liye surakshit tha
 Later this noun was also given to merchant groups
 But later, after the emergence of Buddhism, Brahmins started calling their organizations Sangh and their groups as Gana
 negam athwa nigam shabd kaa angreji paryaay Corporation he, jiskaa aashay ek aise jimmedaar sanghathan se he, jiskaa gathan vishisht sevaaon kii dekhbhaal tathaa unhen sucharu banaae rakhane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Civil services include social, economic and political services
 shreni tathaa pug kii bhaanti negam bhi vyavsaayik sanghathan hote the
 The task of defining the corporate was done by Katyayan
 unke anusaar negam kaa aashay ek hi nagar ke nagarikon ke samooh se he
 In Vedic literature, words like category, poog or nagam have come up in many places, where they generally mean party or organization
 haalanki kiran kumaar thaplyaal kii raay isse kuch bhinn he
 According to him, the scope of the corporation or corporation was wide, even beyond the urban boundaries
 The relative category of a corporation was a small unit and a corporation could discipline on several categories
 negam ko ham angl shabd federation kaa paryaay bhi maan sakate hai
 According to him- 'nigam is often considered equivalent to a guild or a city
 yah shreni kii apeksha bade hote the
 Around the Gupta period, the corporation had control over the categories working in one of the enclaves
 ’9 mitra mishra ne ‘virmitroday’ main negam ko paribhaashit karte hue kaha he ki, paur vanikon ko negam kehete hai
 10 In terms of statutory corporates were in line with the modern giant stock company
 da
 satyaketu vidyalankar ke vichaar bhi drushtavy hai—‘jayant stock company ke dhang se sangathit hokar vyapaaree log apane jo samooh banaate the, unki sangya ‘sambhbhuy samutthan’ thi
 But similar to the categories of craftsmen, there were also groups of merchants, who were called 'nigams'
 


jis prakaar shilpi log shreni main sangathit hokar apane saath sambandh rakhane vaale vishyon par kanoon banaate the or shilp ko niyantrit karte the, usee prakaar nigam main sangathit vyapaaree apane vyapaar ke sambandh main vyavastha karte the
 Since the merchants mainly reside in men and they used to have a prominent place there, naturally the institution of power was developed by basing the corporation
 11 buddha sahitya main janapad evam negam ko paraspar paryaayavachi ke rup main prayukt kiya gaya he
 12 The head or head of a corporation was called the 'superior'
 ‘mahabagg’ ke anusaar ek baar rajgrih ke shreshthi ke maharog se vyathit vyapaariyon ne jab uskaa upachaar rajvaidya se karaane kaa vichaar kiya to ve uski anumati ke liye samraat bimbsaar ke darbar main pahunche
 After going there, he prayed - 'O God! This superior has done a lot of favor to you and the corporation
 ’13 spasht he ki nigam ke rup main sangathit vanikon ko hi ‘negam’ kaha jaataa tha
 These trade organizations were empowered, working on a multi-pronged level for development by maintaining discipline over regional categories
 praayah ek hi parikshetra main rahane vaale vyapaaree, shilpkaar, shreni-pramukh apane parikshetra se baahar vyapaar ke prasar ke liye sangathit hote the
 Small categories also united as a corporation to protect their economic interests and to remain in business competition
 vikramaditya khanna ke hawaale se nigam ko or gaharaai se samajha ja saktaa he— ‘aamtaur par vyapaariyon, dastkaron evam takneekee kaaryon main daksh vyaktiyon, yahaan tak ki yudhkala main nipun sainikon ke sanghathan ko nigam athwa shreni ke rup main pahachaanaa jaataa tha
 

 Of these, categories, corporations and pani were more involved in economic activities for the development of their society
 ’14 yajyavlky smriti main nigam ko pashand evam shreni ke samanaantar rakhaa gaya he
 According to Yajnavalkya, heresies were organizations of religious sects
 yajyavlky ke anusaar— ‘shreni-negam-pashand or gana ke sanghathan kii ek hi vidhi he
 '15 On the basis of this analysis the corporation can be entered as a modern European guild or a federation of various categories
 pan ko mudra kaa paryaay mana gaya he
 Pan or pani was also generally meant for such organizations which adopted trade for earning
 jinka lakshya apane sadasyon ke aarthik vikaas ke liye kaary karnaa tha
 Vikramaditya Khanna considered Pani as a group whose aim was the economic upliftment of its members, keeping it at par with the rank and the corporate
 unke anusaar—‘pani ko saamanytah saudagaron, shilpakaaron ke aise samooh ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jo apane maal kii bikri ke liye, kaphilon ke rup main ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak nirantar safar karte rahete the
 '16 In other words, there were convoys of Pani traders, who used to travel country-longitude in connection with their trade
 takneekee rup main unamem tathaa shreni ke anya roopon main bahut antar nahin tha
 Their identities often blend into each other
 bharat main sahyogadhaarit vyapaarik aarthik sanghathanon ke liye shreni shabd kaa upyog isa se bhi aath sau varsh pehle se hota aa rahaa he paraspar sahyogadhaarit sanghathanon ke liye yah shabd itnaa prachlit rahaa he ki unhen vyavasthit karne or vaidhaniktaa kaa darja dilaanevaale niyamon ko bhi shreni-dharm kaha jaataa tha- sangathit vyapaar evam utpaadan ke kshetra main kaary karne vaale sanghathanon ke liye yah sambodhan 1000 isvi; arthath muslim samrajya kii sthapana tak logon kii jubaan par chadha rahaa
 in sanghathanon ke liye yadhyapi pug, negam, vratya, paani, gana aadi sangyaaen bhi prachinkaal se chali aa rahi thim, vidwaanon ne unke bich ke saidhantik antar spasht karne kaa prayaas bhi kiya he, tathaapi aise sanghathanon ke shreni shabd kaa prachlan hi sarvaadhik rahaa
 aaj bhi ise gild ke paryaay ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 It is important that European organizations are synonymous with the guild category
 tathaapi bhartiya prayadweep main shreni shabd kaa upyog vyapak sandarbh liye hue tha
 Almost all types of business, entrepreneur and political organizations, civic service bodies were identified under the category name
 jahaan tak pracheen sandarbhon kii baat he, vishnudharmasutra main shreni kaa ullekh sangathit samaaj ke liye kiya gaya he, jabaki mitakshra ne shreni ko paan ke patton ke vyapaariyon kaa samudaay mana gaya he
 17 Yajnavalkya considers the category to be the organization of people of different castes, who organize for a common economic-commercial purpose
 jo bhi ho itnaa satya he ki shreni vyapaariyon ke sangathit samooh the, jinaki apni pahchaan thi
 Different interpretations of him by scholars are also possible due to his experience and geographical circumstances
 ullekhneey he ki vyapaarik sanghathanon ko alag-alag naam kaa diya janaa kinchit matvabhinnya tathaa suvidha kii drushti se tha
 Any person or group was allowed to adopt any type of business according to the protection of their interests
 haalanki kai sthaan par is niyam main vyavdhaan bhi the
 In order of arrangement, the categories were allowed to work in the business fixed to them
 ’yajyavlky ne aise kulon jatiyon, shreniyon evam ganon ko dandit karne ko kaha he, jo apane aachaar-vyavhaar se chyut hote hai
 '18 Narada Smriti also describes his traditional works by referring to the categories, nigam, poog and gana
 in sanghathanon ke vyavsaay ke anusaar unki sanrachana evam saamaajik prasthiti main bhi antar tha
 Yajnavalkya has written that Pugas and categories have full right to explore, resolve their quarrels
 unhone pug ko shreni se ucchtam sthiti main mana he
 Mitakshara also endorsed Yajnavalkya, recognizing only the highest position of Pug between the category and Pug
 mitakshra ke anusaar— ‘pug ek sthaan kii vibhinn jatiyon evam vibhinn vyavsaay vaale logon kaa samudaay he or shreni vibhinn jatiyon ke logon kaa samudaay he—jaise helabukon, tambulikon, kuvindon evam charmkaaron kii shreniyan
 chaahmaan vigraharaj ke prastarlekh main ‘hedavikon ko prayek ghode ke ek dramm dene kaa vrittant miltaa he
 It is written in Nasik inscription No
 15 that in the reign of Abhira king Ishwarsen, in the community of 1000 karshan potters, in the category of 500 karshan oilmen, 2000 karashans were deposited as stable property in the category of water givers, so that patients with their interest The monks could be given medicine
 The ninth and twelfth inscriptions of Nashik also mention the category of weavers
 huvishk ke shasankaal ke mathura ke brahmshilawaalon evam konsyakaron kii shreniyon main dhan jamaa karne kii charchaa hui he
 a grade of oil is mentioned in Skandagupta's Indore Tamrapatra
 in sab baton se spasht he ki isa ke aasapaas kii shatabdiyon main kuch jatiyon, yatha lakadahaaron, tailiyon, tamoliyon, julahon aadi ke samudaay is prakaar kii sangathit evam vyavasthit the ki log unamem nibasancoch sahasron rupee is vichaar ke saath jamaa karte the ki unase byaaj-rup main daan ke liye dhan miltaa rahegaa
’19 spasht he ki pracheen bharat main shreniyan na keval sangathit vyapaar kaa madhyam bani hui thim, balki ve aadhunik vittiya sanghathanon kii tarah vyavhaar bhi karti thim
 People could also deposit their personal money with them with a desire for profit or profit
 us samay ke shaskaon ko bhi shreniyon kii vittiya kshamtaaon par puraa vishwaas tha
 Even money was invested in categories to fulfill the obligations of the state
 mathura se praapt duusari shatabdi ke ek dastavej main bunakaron kii do shreniyon main se prayek ke paas chaandi ke 550 sikke jamaa karne kaa ullekh miltaa he, taaki usase praapt byaaj se brahmanon tathaa garibon ko bhojan karaayaa ja sake
 byaaj kii dar bahut upyukt bahut kuch vartmaan daron ke anukool thi
 According to Professor Kiran Kumar Thaplyal, in the Nashik inscription, two thousand karpanas were provided to the weavers at the rate of one rupee to a hundred thousand rupees per month, so that food, clothes, etc
 could be arranged for the monks with that money
 Similarly, another document also mentions giving another category of weavers at one interest of 0
75 rupees per month for providing food to the monks
 isi prakaar gupt samraat skandagupt ke ek lekh main indrapur nivasini tailiyon kii shreni ko kuch dhan udhaar ke rup main dene kaa ullekh hua he, taaki usase milane vaale byaaj se surya mandir ke deepon ke liye tel kaa kharch nikalataa rahe
 in uddharanon se siddh hota he, ki us samay ke bade rajya bhi apni samaaj-kalyaan sambandhi yojanaon ko puraa karne ke liye bhi shreniyon kii vittiya sthiti or saakh kaa laabh uthaane kaa prayaas karte rahete the— ‘ye shreniyan bank kaa kaary karti thim or inako itnaa tikaoo evam chirsthayee mana jaataa tha ki swayan raja yaa raajpurush bhi inke paas akshayanidhi rakhaa karte the
 The matter of depositing money was also narrated before the nigam-sabha
 20 samuhik sahmati or sarvakalyaan kii bhaavana ke aadhaar par gathit un vyapaarik sanghathanon ko vyapak adhikaar praapt the
 But this jurisdiction was valid only as long as the groups edit welfare programs in the interest of themselves and the state
 They were not allowed to do any kind of anti-national or anti-people work
 raja ko aise samoohon par niyantran karne kaa shastrokt adhikaar praapt tha
 Kautilya has clearly explained these rights in his Arthashastra
 vaise bhi aarthik uplabdhiyon ko niti, maryaada evam saamaajik shuchita dwaara niyantrit evam maryaadit karne kii parampara bhartiya samaaj main adikaal se hi rahi he, jise praayah sabhi dharmagranthon main sammanit sthaan praapt hua he
 According to a theory of economics in the Indian tradition, according to it - 'the man whose economic life is pure - he himself is also pure
 21 iskaa sidhaa-sa aashay he ki naitik pavitrataa ke liye vyakti ko apane aarthik jivan kii pavitrataa kaa dhyaan rakhana atyaavashyak he
 Without bringing purity to economic life, purity in social life is not possible
 paroksh rup main yah siddhant jahaan maanav jivan main arth kii mahatta ko sweekaar karata he, vahiin uski prapti ke maarg ko bhi maryaadit karata hua chalata he
 Emphasis on purity and moral decorum in economic life, these sentiments point towards the then people-oriented arrangements existing in Indian society
 saaf he ki un dinon bhartiya samaaj main sahakaarita bhale hi us rup main maujuud na rahi ho, jaisaa ki ham aaj usko dekhte hai, magar vah siddhant or bhaavnaatmak rup bhartiya chintan parampara sahakaarita kii bhaavana ke bahut nikat he
 It is to be noted here that even though the masses in ancient society are not very advanced in educational form — they may be unable to study and study the major scriptures, but each period of human civilization has an abundance of practical knowledge
 Has been sabhyataa ke praarambhik daur main bhi bhartiya samaaj main lagbhag ve sabhi vyavasthaayen maujuud thim, jinhen samaaj kalyaan kii anivaaryta mana jaataa he
 As far as the coverage of cooperative groups is concerned, Professor R
C
 Mazumdar has mentioned 27 types of societies in his book 'cooperative Life in Ancient India' (cooperative Life in Ancient India)
 ek anya sthaan par katyayan ne likhaa he ki samitiyaan kai prakaar kii hoti thim or unhen kai naamon se pukaara jaataa tha
 Dr
 Satyaketu Vidyalankar, in his book The Governments and Political Thought of Ancient India, quoted Buddhist texts that in those days there were eighteen types of categories
 isi prakaar kautilya ne bhi arthshaastra main atharah prakaar ke vyapaar samoohon kaa ullekh kiya he, jinka us samay ke samaaj evam shashan par vyapak prabhaav tha

 "the lyrics were penned at Fonsi's house in late 2015, when he expressed a desire to record a" swinging song "for his new album
 panamai gayika or geetkaar erika ander, jo ek latin gremi award-vijeta hai, miami main lui fonsi ke ghar gai, jahaan fonsi ne unhen kaha ki vah "despasito" naamak ek geet likhane ke bare main soch rahe hai
 "fonsi sang the lines" Vamos a Hakarlo en Una Playa in Porto Rico ", to which Ender called" Hasta le las olas grittain ai bandito "and then composed the rest of the song
 geet ko kshetreey dhwani nahin dene ke liye baad main porto rico vaali line ko geet ke ant main sthanantarit kar diya gaya or phir unhone video kii kahani likhnaa shuru kar diya
 Fonsi first wanted to write it as a cumbia and pop song, but later began considering giving it an "urban injection" and contacted reggaeton artist Daddy Yankee via whatsapp to listen to a demo of Fonsi's song After agreed to work together
 "despasito" se pehle, fonsi or daddy yanki ne "una opertunidad" par ek saath kaam kiya tha, jo 2010 main digital release kiya gaya tha
 Daddy Yankee wrote his poem and post-chorus, which he wrote while thinking of his father while he was playing bongos in his house
 un donon ne yah geet 2016 main miami main record kiya
 The song is produced by Mauricio Rengifo and Andres Torres
 rengifo ko purv colibyan pop jodi kaili and el dandi ke sadsy ke rup main janaa jaataa he or torres ko pramukh latin kalakaron jaise david bisbal, thelia or riki martin ke saath kaam karne ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Originally, Luis Fonsi focused on other songs on his album after making a demo of "despacito"
 apane nirmaataaon ko geet dikhaane ke baad unhone or fonsi ne "despasito" par dhyaan kendrit karnaa shuru kiya, or anya kaaryon ko alag chhodane kaa faisla kiya
 Fonsi said that both Daddy Yaki and he were surprised after hearing the final song, as it sounded "powerful, fresh and different"
 lui fonsi ne yah bhi kaha ki vah ise regeton geet nahin maanate, lekin lagata he ki "isamen regeton kii urja or halaki urban beats hai
 "at the same time he also confirmed that Daddy Yankee's work was a plus for the song because the song" needed the explosion that only he could bring to the song
 " ander ne kaha ki geet "kai parivartanon se gujara" jab tak fonsi ko vah nahin mila, "jo vah chaahate the
 " fonsi ne kaha ki unhone "despasito" ko ek nrity yogya geet isliye banaaya kyonki "latin ke logon ko khush rahane ke liye janaa jaataa he" or vah ullaspurn sangeet kii jarurat mahasoos karte hai
 He added that the song's "urban feel" is a type that "breathes in and out" and is "synonymous with party"
 " unke anusaar, "despasito" ek bahut melodic geet he, jo kai anya sangeet shaileyon ko acchhee tarah se anukulit kar saktaa he
 In an interview with Billboard magazine in April 2017, Erica Ender stated that her song "made a special connection" and collaborating with Daddy Yankee "was a great idea"
 " usne yah bhi kaha ki geet kii kaamuk prakruti ke kaaran, unhen "ek acha geet ke liye zimmedaar hona zaruri he" or fonsi ke liye likhte samay unka drushtikon "achche vichaaron ke saath baaten kaise kahen" kaa dhyaan rakhana tha
 During the 2017 Billboard Latin Music Conference, american-puerto Rican singer and songwriter Nikki Jam reported that he was in place of Daddy Yankee in the original version of "despacito"
 universal music latin dwaara 13 janvari 2017 ko "despasito" digital downlod ke liye uplabdh karaayaa gaya tha

 The trend was named "new pop" by Fonsi, while Eder said, "everyone is doing this kind of fusion
" " The song also received positive reactions from critics
 eexs ke doris irizarari ne "latin lay" or urban sangeet ke fusion kii saraahna kii, or ise "maarmik" kahkar varnit kiya

 "caroline Soriano of Entata magazine described the song's beat as" quite sexy and catchy ", and defined the song as" captivating "
 rolling stone patrika ke britaini spanos ne ise aakarshak, sexi or dilkash bataaya
 Billboard's Lila Cobo called "despacito" a "great pop song", and highlighted the "undeniable improvisational potential" of its pre-chorus and chorus

 "he further explained that" the brain finds that the rhythm is broken, and it immediately leaves its mark ", and claims that this" trick "is not very common" and that pop music has little use
 " sinsinati vishvavidhyalay ke bijness skool main sangeetkaar or professor, james kelaaris ne vyakt kiya ki "hansmukh, saral, doharaav or ek khubasurat taal hone ke kaaran" despasito main "yearwarm tatv shaamil hai

 Tarabai Shinde was a feminist activist who opposed patriarchy and caste in 19th century India
 vah apane prakashit kaam, stri-purush tulana, mul rup main 1882 main marathi main prakashit ke liye jaani jaati he
 This pamphlet is a critique of upper-caste patriarchy, and is often considered the first modern Indian feminist text

 The Phule couple shared with Shinde an awareness of the different axes of oppression that constitute gender and caste, as well as the intimate nature of the two

 According to Susi Tharu and k Lalitha, "


 Male-male comparisons are probably the first complete and prevalent feminist argument after the poetry of the Bhakti period
 lekin tarabai kaa kaam bhi mahatvapurn he kyonki jab ek samay main buddhijiviyon or kaaryakarta donon hi mukhya rup se ek hindu vidhwaa kii jindagi or mahilaon par aasaani se pahchaanane vaali atyaacharon kii kathinaaiyon se sambodhit the, jahiraa taur par algaav main kaam kar rahi tarabai scindia, pitrusattatmak samaaj ke vaicharik dhaanche ko shaamil karke vishleshan ke daayre ko vyapak banane main sakasham thi
 Women everywhere, they mean, suffer the same way
 " Prakrit is the common name of many regional languages which developed in the medieval era of the Indian Aryabhasha, and all the texts written in those languages are called Prakrit literature
 vikaas kii drushti se bhashavaigyanikon ne bharat main aryabhasha ke teen str niyat kiye hai - pracheen, madhyakaalin or arvachin
 The languages of ancient level are Vedic Sanskrit and Sanskrit, whose development period is supposedly BC
 From 2000 BC Up to 600 are considered
 madhyayugin bhashaayen hai - magadhi, ardhamagadhi, shauraseni, pashachi bhashaa, maharashtri or apbhransh
 Their development is found as early as 600 AD to 1000 AD
 iske pashchaat, hindi, gujarati, marathi, banglaa, aadi uttar bharat kii aadhunik aryabhashaon kaa vikaas prarambh hua jo aaj tak chalaa aa rahaa he
 The following characteristics are found mainly in the said medieval languages from ancient languages: sanskrit ke swaron main ri, lri, evam i or ou kaa madhyayugin bhashaaon main abhaav he
 These languages have their own specialty using a and O's passive quantities
 visarg yahan sarvatha nahin paaya jaataa
 Tangents from a to m are found
 kintu anunasikon main sankoch tathaa vyatyay hota he
 Only one and especially the residual is found in place of the three heat colors
 sanyukt vyanjanon kaa praaia abhaav he
 Both the conjunctive consonants are either equated or both are separated by Swaragam, or one of them is omitted
 dvitv vyanjan se purv kaa deergh swar hrasv kar diya jaataa he evam sanyukt vyanjan main se ek kaa lop kar usase purv kaa hrasv swar deergh kar diya jaataa he
 Grammatically, dialects are not found in the forms of nouns and verbs
 halant sangyaaon or dhaatuon ko swarant banaakar chalaaya jaataa he
 Hesitancy is found in forms of causation
 kriyaaon main ganabhed evam parasmapad aatmanepad kaa bhed nahin kiya jaataa
 All types of options go by option
 kriyaroopon main kaladi bhedon kaa alpikaran hua he
 Much of their work is often run with participles
 ab prashn yah hota he ki madhyayug kii bhashaaon main sanskrit kii apeksha itani adhik visheshtaayen kab, kyon, kaise or kahan par utpann ho gayi
 Varyukhi etc
 of Prakrit, assuming the nature of Prakrit languages as Sanskrit, derived the word Prakrit from it
 "prakruti: sanskritan, tatrabhavan tat aagtan vaa prakritam"
 But the present form of the Sanskrit language itself has developed around the pre-sixth century AD and its stable form was found by Panini
 The third is given in the fourth century
 sanskrit ke ukt prakaar ke anek lakshanon se vibhinn bhashaaon kaa chhathi shatee i
 pus
 main hi utpann hona kaise sambhav ho saktaa he ? iske atirikt praakrit main aise bhi anek shabd paae jate hai jinka sanskrit main abhaav he, kintu vaidic bhashaa main ve vidyaman hai
 Many of the words with many of Prakrit's tendencies are found in the Vedas, which are not compatible with Sanskrit grammar
 is samasya par anek paashchaatya vidwaanon kaa ek mat yah he ki aryabhasha jab bharatvarsh main prachlit hui, anarya log uskaa aaryo ke sadrush shuddh shuddh uccharan or prayog nahin kar paae; atev unhone apane nijee uccharan evam bhashastyli ke anusaar use bolnaa prarambh kiya or unke sampark se is kaa prabhaav aaryo par bhi padaa
 Due to this, the instincts of Prakrit language developed
 is mat ke samarthan main yah baat bhi dhyaan dene yogya he ki vaidic kaal se hi jo t th aadi murdhanya dhvaniyon kaa pravesh aryabhasha main hua, vah bahulata se us kaal kii anarya bhashaaon kaa hi prabhaav tha
 But by analyzing the ancient non-aryan languages, it cannot be proved that the seeds of the above characteristics of Prakrit were present in those non-aryan languages
 isiliye is mat ke sambandh main vivaad he
 The second view is that there were phonetic distinctions among the castes that spoke the language of the Vedas, some evidence of which is present in the Vedas itself
 Presumably, the language of the Vedas evolved from the hierarchy of the orthodox Vedas of that period, presumably in several thousand years
 But the specially educated priestly class had its own language, and in which it was used only in religious works
 utane hi kaal pracheenatam vaidic bhashaa kii samakaleen jansadharan kii lokbhasha se sanskrit ke saath saath hi praakrit kaa bhi vikaas hua, jisamen pradeshbhedanusaar naanaa bhed the
 It is also worth noting in this regard that the entry of Aryans in India cannot be said to have taken place at the same time and in one stream
 yadi aage peeche aanevaali arya jatiyon ke bhashabhed se praakrit bhashaaon ke udgam or vikaas va sambandh ho to aashcharya nahin
 In this connection, the opinion of Hornley and Grierson is also notable according to which the Indian Aryan languages are found divided into two classes, one external and the other two in the north, west, south and east languages
 ise sankshep main samajhane ke liye maharashtra pradesh ke naamon jaise gokhale, kher, paranjape, padhye, munje godwole, tambe, tathaa lanka main prachlit naamon jaise gunatilake sena naike, bandarnayak aadi main jo acarant karta ek vachan ke rup se e pratyay dikhaai detaa he, vahi purv kii magadhi praakrit me apane niyamit sthirataa ko praapt hua paaya jaataa he
 In the Adi Aryabhasha, the pronunciation of l has been considered in place of Vedic, like Kulu u srotra
 usee pravriti ke falswaroop vaidic vrik ke sthaan par german bhashasmooh main vulf evam greek main pruthu kaa plutus paaya jaataa he
 These are replaced by the pronunciation of l in the place of sound, but their symmetrical forms like Otta atta, satta are also found in dialects of the same period
 bogaajakui ke bhinn mitanni aryashakha ke jo lagbhag 200 i
 pus
 ke lekh mili hai unamem indra or naasatya devataaon ke naam inder or nasaateey rup se ankit hai
 There is a tendency among them to combine combined characters by voice
 varun devtaa kaa naam "uruvan" rup main ullikhit he jisamen swar ke agragam tathaa varnavyatyay kii pravriti spasht dikhaai detii he
 These trends are common symptoms of Prakrit
 pali main prayukt idh sanskrit tathaa vaidic ke ih se purvakaleen parampara kaa he isamen bhi kisi ko koi andeh nahin he
 In the Arya language, the forms of a and o were Hrasva; Ai and Au were lacking; But mixed vowels like ai, au were prevalent; Resonant touches were hesitant; Of the three heats, there was only one
 ye dhvanyatmak visheshtaayen pradhanat: shauraseni praakrit main surakshit pai jaati hai, ityadi
 The harmony of these traits can be properly resolved by assuming that their arrival in the Prakrit languages has been carried on by dialects of the earliest Aryan castes, a tradition unconstrained
 yatharthat: sanskrit ho athwa vaidic ko hi praakrit kii prakruti maan lene se ukt lakshanon kaa koi samaadhaan nahin hota
 Then why did the grammar of Prakrit call Sanskrit the nature of Prakrit? The reason for this is clearly understood by paying attention to the time and form of the grammar of those grammars
 ve vyakaran us kaal main likhe gaye jab vidvatsamaj main praakrit kii apeksha sanskrit kaa adhik prachaar or sammaan tha
 They have also been written in Sanskrit language and they also had to aim for naturalism in Sanskrit plays and in which excellent literary works were also produced
 atev un vaiyakarnon ne sanskrit ko adarsh tehraakar usase jo visheshtaayen praakrit main thim unka vivaran upasthit kar diya or isaki sarthakata sanskrit ko praakrit kii prakruti kahkar siddh kar di
 However, Namisadhu has made his view clear that the meaning of nature is public or public and that people should be called Prakrit only after being a language
 prakruti kaa arth lok bahut pracheen he tathaa kalidas ne bhi uskaa lok ke arth main prayog kiya he 
 In the light of this very ancient tradition of Prakrit, the rationale of calling these languages late and medieval rather than Vedic and Sanskrit also becomes considerable
 uski yadi koi sarthakata he to keval itani ki ye bhashaayen vaidic or sanskrit ke pashchaat hi sahitya main prayukt huin
 They were used for the first time for religious propaganda
 Shramana Mahavir and Buddha did it in the sixth century
 tathaa unki saahitiyik rachanaaon main shabdon tathaa style kii drushti se sanskrit kaa bada prabhaav drushtigochar hota he
 As long as the language remains in the dialect, it changes constantly in comparison to the country and time
 isi niyam ke anusaar kaal ke saapeksh praakrit ke teen str sweekaar kiye gaye hai - The language or languages in which Shramana Mahavira and Buddha gave their teachings must have been excellent forms of ancient level of Prakrit
 unke upadeshon kii bhashaa ko kramash: magadhi evam ardhamagadhi kaha gaya he
 But we do not find the form of Magadhi in the texts of the language currently called Pali, as the later grammarians have told
 tathaapi bhashaa kaa jo swaroop buddha tripitak granthon main paaya jaataa he vah praakrit ke pracheen str kaa hi sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 The most authentic form of this level Prakrit is available in the scriptures engraved on the stones and pillars of Ashoka
 in shilaon kii sankhya lagbhag 30 he
 Fortunately, only the nature of the Prakrit language of the E
 East III century is safe, but in those commendations we also get the regional differences of the then language
 pashchimottar pradesh main shahbajgadhi or mansehara naamak sthanon kii shilaon par jo 14 prashastiyaan khudi hui pai gai hai unamem sparsh varnon ke atirikt r or l evam sh sh s ye teenon ooshm praaia: apane apane sthanon par surakshit hai
 Combined characters containing the type also appear
 kintu jna or nay ke sthaan par na kaa prayog paaya jaataa he
 Thus, this language can be said to be the vampiric nature of grammars
 ye hi 14 prashastiyaan us bhashaa ko shauraseni kaa pracheen rup prakat karti hai
 They are also engraved with 14 testimonials at places known as Uttar Kalsi, Jaugad Nachhauli
 inamen hamen r ke sthaan par l tathaa acarant sangyaaon ke karta kaarak ek vachan kii e vibhakti praapt hoti he
 However, instead of three heaters, there is no existence of milk
 is prakaar yahan magadhi praakrit ke teen lakshan nahin
 Therefore, it receives two of the three symptoms of half-life Prakrit more abundantly than Magadhi, but not the third sign of affection
 atev ise magadhi kii apeksha ardhamagadhi praakrit kaa pracheen rup kahana adhik upyukt prathit hota he
 Ashoka's commendations are important in literary terms in addition to his philological significance
 unamem pracheen bharat ke ek aise samraat ke niti, dharm evam sadachaar sambandhi vichaar or upadesh nihit hai jisane na keval is vishaal desh ke samast bhaagon par raajnneetik adhikaar hi praapt kiya tha, tathaa desh ke baahar bhi alexandria tak bhinn bhinn deshon se saanskrithik sambandh sthapit kiya tha or yahan apane dharmadoot bhi bheje the
 Outside of all this, even to Alexandria, cultural relations were established with different countries and sent their apostles there
 in sab drushtiyon se yah sahitya apane dhang kaa adwitiya he
 Another example of ancient level Prakrit is the article of Kalingasamrat Kharavel engraved in the cavity named Hathigumpha of Udayagiri Khandagiri in Orissa which resembles Ashoka's inscriptions in many respects
 kintu isaki apni visheshta yah he ki isamen us samrat ke varsho kii vijayon tathaa lokkalyaan sambandhi kaaryo kaa vivaran likhaa gaya he
 Its period is supposedly BC Second century
 uski bhashaa ashok kii girnaar kii prashastiyon se mail khaati he, atev vah pracheen shauraseni kahi ja sakati he
 BC of this nature It is found in the third century in western India and its hundred, one and a half hundred years later Jain texts like Jain Shatkhandagam and Kundakundacharya etc
 in the compositions of South Pradesh are proof of its erstwhile divinity and universality
 us kaal main itnaa prachaar or kisi bhashaa kaa nahin paaya jaataa
 We find use of this ancient level of Prakrit in the available segments of plays like Sarvaputra episode, Ashwaghosh
 inamen nayakon tathaa ek do anya paatro ko chhodkar shesh sabhi paatr praakrit bolte hai, jiske teen rup spasht dikhaai dete hai
 In the Sariputra episode, in the language of the wicked, instead of,, श् in place of the three thermals, and विभ inflection as the nominative singular of the non-term nouns, these three signs clearly prove that part to be Magadhi
 yahan k t aadi aghosh varna na to g d aadi saghoshon main parivartit hue milte, na tha gh aadi mahapraan varna h main parivartit hue milte, na th gh aadi mahapraan varna hri main parivartit hue or na dantya n ke sthaan par murdhanya na dikhaai detaa
 These signs of Prakrit of Ashwaghosh are proving him of ancient status
 gorv naamak paatr kii bhashaa kii praakrit main r ke sthaan par s kaa prayog hua he
 These symptoms are proving him half-dead
 nayika, vidooshak tathaa anya paatro kii praakrit main r or l apane apane sthanon par hai
 All are found in the form of heat, and the nominative singular form is found
 inase yah bhashaa spashtat: pracheen shauraseni kahi ja sakati he
 After this, a detailed description of the distinctions of Prakrit languages is found in Bharata Natyashastra
 unhone vaani kaa paath do prakaar kaa mana he- sanskrit or praakrit; tathaa kaha he ki praakrit main teen prakaar ke shabd prachlit hai- samaan, vibhrasht or deshi
 He has given the description of linguistics in the play in this way - the best characters should speak Sanskrit, but if they become poor then speak Prakrit; Shramana, ascetic monk, woman, child, etc
 are impure
 tathaapi itnaa spasht he ki unhone k, t, da, ya or va ke lop, kha, gha aadi mahapraan varno ke sthaan par ha kaa aadesh; t kaa da, anadi t kaa aspasht da car uccharan; sht, shna aadi kaa khakaar, in parivartanon kaa ullekh kiya he
 It is evident from this that they are describing only the second level of Prakrit
 32wein adhyay main unhone dhruva naamak geetikavy kaa vistaar se udaahranon sahit varnan kiya he or spasht kaha he ki dhruva main shauraseni kaa hi prayog kiya janaa chahie 
 This is also proved by his examples
 at: pashchaatkaaleen dharna nirmul he ki naatakon ke gey bhaag main maharashtri kaa prayog kiya jaay
 Shaharaseni language should be used in drama by the opinion of Bharat or any country language as desired
 aisi deshbhashaayen saat hai - magadhi, aavanti, shauraseni, ardhamagadhi, vahlika or dakshinatya
 Magadhi for inner residents; Arghamagadhi for Chet, Rajputra and Seths; Oriya for Vidushkadi; Half-wagon for heroines and friends; Oriya for Vidushkadi; Avantha Avantha from Shaurseni for heroines and friends; Dakshinatya for warriors, civilians and gamblers; And use the Wahlika for castes, khas, shabar, shaka etc
 inke atirikt bharat ne shabar, aabhir, chandal aadi kii hin bhashaaon ko vibhasha kaha he
 In this way, the natural feelings that have been distributed among the characters of Bharata drama are partially followed in Sanskrit plays
 sanskrit naatakon main sabase adhik praakrit kaa upyog or vaichitrya shudrak krit mrichhakaticam main miltaa he
 According to Pishal, Keith scholars, etc
, the purpose of the creation of Mruthaktik seems to be to exemplify the rules of Natya Shastra related to Prakrit
 is naatak ke tikaakar prithvidhar ke matanusaar naatak main chaar prakaar kii praakrit kaa hi prayog kiya jaataa he - shauraseni, avantika, praachya or magadhi
 In the play presented, 11 characters such as Sutradhar, Nati, heroine Vasantasena, Brahmin woman and superior of Charudatta and their hostess are spoken by Shaurseni
 aavanti bhashaa bolanewaale keval do apradhan paatr hai
 The jester only speaks the oriental language; Then a total of six characters, the sons of Kunj, Chetak, Monk and Charudatta, speak Magadhi, in addition to this there are two characters each of Shakari, Chandali and Dhaki
 kintu yadi in sab paatro kii bhashaa kaa vishleshan kiya jaae to ve sab keval do bhaagon main baanti ja sakati hai - shauraseni or magaghi
 The commentator himself has said that in Avanti, only Rakar and the proverbs have a multiplicity and in Oriya the selfishness of Kakar
 anya baton main ve shauraseni hi hai
 Shakari, Chandali and Dhaki are all styles of Magadhi
 is prakaar naamchaar kaa praakrit bahulya hone par bhi vastut: mrichctic main ashwaghosh ke naatakon kii apeksha koi adhik bhashabhed nahin dikhaai detaa
 The nature of Prakrit has evolved from time to time and it has got some symptoms due to which this Prakrit is said to be second level than the ancient level
 isi str kii praakrit tathaa uske deshbhedon kaa vivaran hamen uplabdh praakrit vyakaranon main miltaa he or unheen kaa vipul sahitya bhi vidyaman he
 The primary language of the second level of Prakrit is the Chandrakrit Prakrit Grammar or Aashr Prakrit Grammar
 yah ati sankshipt he or keval 99 sutron main praakrit kii vidhiyon kaa nirupan kar diya gaya he
 The formulas that characterize this level are worth noting
 sutara 76 ke anusaar virgo ke pratham k ch t t aadi varnon ke sthaan par tritiy kaa aadesh hota he, jaise, pishachi -- bissaji, jataa -- data, kruthan -- kadan, pratisiddh -- padisiddhan
 According to sutra 77, the order of hakara in the place of kh & g such as mukh - muhan, megh: - neho, madhava: - mahvo, taurus: - vasho
 sutara 97 ke anusaar k tathaa virgon ke tritiy varno kaa swar ke pare lop hota he, jaise - kokil: -- kohli, bhaugik: -- bhoio, raja -- raaya, nadi -- nai
 According to Sutra 98, when there is no beyond the missing consonant, it is like, kakau kayau, nanau naya, rajau raya
 antim 99wein sutara main kaha gaya he ki praakrit kii shesh vyavastha shisht prayogon se janani chahie
 In the four sutras ahead of them, the signs of apomorphy, the absence of the joint letter, the order of l and n in place of Peshachi, the order of l and sh in place of guide, and the order of l and sh in place of st, The command of d is stated by the option in place of t
 bhashashastriyon kaa mat he ki dwitiya str ke aadi me k aadi abodh varnon ke sthaan par g aadi saghosh varno kaa uccharan hone laga
 Then their lower sound was left and then completely omitted, and instead of mahaprana sounds only a pure warm sound was left
 ye pravritiyaan tathaa ukt aarsh vyakaran main nirdisht ya shruti vikalp se samast jain praakrit he
 But based on the misconceptions that the Prakrit grammars of the later 16th, 17th centuries have produced in the representation of Prakrit, some Western scholars considered it necessary to specify the Prakrit of Jain literature separately by the names of Jaina Shaurseni and Jain Maharashtri due to the harmony of the above options
 , It is not historically real
 is aarsh praakrit vyakaran ke pashchaat prakritprakash naamak vyakaran likhaa gaya, jisamen aage do baar vruddhi kii gai
 The nine passages of Adi are varruced
 iname adarsh praakrit kii kramash: swarvidhi, vyanjanvidhi, sanyuktavarna vidhi, sankeern, sangyaroop, sarvnaam vidhi, kriyaaroop, dhatvadesh evam avyayon kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 Finally it is said that the remaining form of Prakrit should be understood by Sanskrit
 is vyakaran main dwitiya str ke praakrit kaa swaroop purnroop se nirdhaarit hua paaya jaataa he
 According to it, the intermediate is often omitted by the word d and d, and the command in place of the word and language
 prakritprakash ke is pracheen vibhaag par katyayan, bhamah, vasantraj, sadanand or rampanivadakrut tikaayen pai jaati hai
 In the 10th and 12th passages, the pasachi is represented in 14 sutras and the Magadhi in 17 sutras respectively
 in donon bhashaaon kii prakruti shauraseni kahi gai he
 But before that Shoureseni's name did not come anywhere
 atev anumaanath: iske kartaaon kii drushti main saamaanya praakrit kaa nirupan us kaal kii suprachlit shorseni kaa hi he
 These two passages have only Bhamha's commentary and scholars estimate that these two passages are paired with them
 inamen pashachi kaa visheshta shabd ke madhya main tritiy chaturth varno ke sthaan par pratham tathaa dwitiya kaa aadesh, na ke sthaan par n, j, nya ke sthaan par na tathaa twa ke sthaan par tun batalaai gai he or magadhi kii sh, s, ke sthaan par ksha j ke sthaan par y, ksha ke sthaan par ek ahan ke sthaan par hake, hage va ahake, tathaa acarant karta kaarak ekvachan ke ant main e kahi gai hai
 The last 12th passage of Prakrit light appears to be added far back
 isapar bhamah va anya kisi kii tikaa nahin he
 The condition of this passage is very unique
 isamen shauraseni ke lakshan batalaaye gaye hai, jisaki aadi main hi prakruti sanskrit kahi gai hai
 But in the last 32nd sutra it has been said again: Hr Shesham Maharashtri Vat
 parantu maharashtri shabd isse purv granth bhar main athwa anya kahin vyakaran main aayaa hi nahin he
 It seems that this passage has been added at a time when the notion was strengthened that the language of Prakrit poetry should be Maharashtri
 atev jahaan praakrit kaa nirdesh he, vahaan maharashtri kaa hi taatpary grahan kiya jaay
 From the form of Shaurseni which has been described here, it is clear from this that the form which has been told here of the common nature, is the developed form of Shaurseni itself
 udaahranarth shauraseni main madhyavarti t or th ke sthaan kramash: d or dh hote hai, vahaan praakrit main d kaa lop or tha kaa ha hota he
 "bh" of metal remains "bho" in Shaurseni, but in Prakrit there is a command "ho"
 shauraseni main napunsak bahuvachan ke rup main vahaan ni hota he, jaise jalaani, vanani, vahaan praakrit ke keval i rahata he, jaise jalaain, vanain shauraseni main dola, dand tathaa dasan kaa aadi d prakruti rup rahata he, jabaki praakrit main vah d ho jaataa he, jaise dola, dand va dasan ityadi
 After Prakritprakash, the Prakrit grammar was written by Hemachandra in the 12th century AD, making a complete representation of Prakrit and its regional languages
 iske chaar pariched hai, jinamein se lagbhag saadhe teen parichchhedon main praakrit kaa suvyavasthit vivaran diya gaya he or shesh lagbhag 200 sutron main kramash: shauraseni, magadhi, pashachi, chulika pashachi or apbhransh bhashaaon ke vishesh lakshan batalaaye hai
 The form of the first three of these languages is the same as the one detailed above
 chulika pashachi ke lakshan yahan chaar sutron main ye batalaaye gaye hai ki usamen tisare or chauthe varno ke sthaan par pratham or dwitiya kaa aadesh hota he, r kaa l vikalp se hota he, kuch aacharyo ke mat se adivarna kii dhwani main parivartan nahin hota, shesh baaten pashachi ke samaan janani chahie
 Anaphylaxis or anaphylactic numbness is the characteristic state of living organism that immediately after insertion of any type of external protein in the body by needle for the first time, or after a few days, the second time after inserting the same protein by needle

 tivrograhita kii utpatti ke yadhyapi kai kaaran hai, tathaapi mul kaaran henry ech0 del kaa bataaya mana gaya he
 In 1928, he proved by tests that the main reason for the origin of anaphylaxis is the interaction of antigen produced by external proteins in the cells and tissues of the body of the organism and the antimicrobial antibody produced in the body, resulting in a substance called histamine
 Has a counterpoint to
 yah dekha gaya he ki yadi raktod ke rogapratikaarak pratipind nishchit rup se bhraman karte rahete hai, to pratijan unase milakar nishprabhav ho jaaya karte hai or jab ve koshikaon main sthir ho jate hai to pratijan se milakar histamin kii utpatti karte hai, jiske kaaran tivrograhitajanya pratikriya hoti he
 The origin of histamine causes symptoms of involuntary muscle involution, edema in local tissues, general numbness, bumps on the skin, unbearable conduit, burning sensation and low blood pressure
 anya saamaanya lakshanon main atyadhki kamajori, vaman, chakkar, bhram tathaa sangyaheenata aadi pradhan hai
 These symptoms, when they are mild in nature, begin to subside gradually after being present for several hours, but when they are in a violent form, they become fatal in a few minutes or seconds

 Severe cases are often due to food intake, but some people may have a rapid reaction if the food that causes it comes in contact with an organ in the body
 bachche apni allergy se nipat sakate hai
 By the age of 16, 80% of children suffering from anaphylaxis due to milk and eggs, and 20% of children with a single case of anaphylaxis due to peanuts, may ingest these foods without problems

 These include aspirin and nsaids followed by β-lactam antibiotics
 yadi kisi vyakti ko ek eneidi se allergy he to vah saamanyat anaphilaxis ko prerit kiye bagaiyr kisi duusari kaa prayog kar saktaa he
 Other causes of anaphylaxis include chemotherapy, vaccine, protamine, and herbal drugs
 Some medications include vancomycin, morphine, and x-ray images to enhance images that destroy histamine from various cells in tissues
 Causes secretions that cause anaphylaxis

 Anaphylaxis from penicillin or cephalosporin can only occur when they combine with proteins within the body and some of them combine much more easily than others
 pencelin ke kaaran anaphilaxis 2000 se 10,000 logon main se ek main utpann hota he jinka upachaar kiya gaya he
 One out of 50,000 people treated dies
 aspirin or eneediai ke kaaran anaphilaxis lagbhag 50,000 vyaktiyon main se ek vyakti main hota he
 If a person has a reaction due to penicillin, he or she has a higher risk of reaction due to cephalosporins but this risk is less than one in 1000 persons
 puraani davaaiyaan jinka upyog eks-re pratibimb unnat karne ke liye kiya gaya he unke kaaran 1% maamalon main riection hoti he

 kiton jaise madhumakhiyaan or tataiya / barr yaa kising bag ke dansh yaa kaatane se vish ke kaaran anaphilaxis ho saktaa he
 If a person has undergone a reaction due to the poison before and its effect is more than just bite / bite, then there is a greater risk of anaphylaxis in future
 parantu anaphilaxis ke kaaran marane vaale aadhe se adhik vyaktiyon main pehle vyapak riection nahin hui he
 Individuals with atopic diseases such as asthma, eczema, or allergic rhinitis have a higher risk of anaphylaxis due to food, latex, and radiocontrast agents

 Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that begins suddenly and affects many systems of the body
 yah daahak karkon or mast koshikaon tathaa baisafills se cytokine ke srav ke kaaran hota he
 Their secretion is especially due to immune system reactions but may be due to the damage of these cells which are not related to the immune system
 anaphilaxis jab pratiraksha pratikriya ke kaaran hota he, immunoglobin e bahari padaarth se sangyojan karata he jo allergic riection armbh karata he
 The combination of ige is associated with receptor fcεri antibody activation on mast cells and basophils
 mast koshikaaye or basophil daahak karkon jaise histamine ke srav karne ke dwaara pratikriya karte hai
 These factors cause contraction in the soft muscles of bronchioli, widen the blood vessels, increase the secretion of fluid from the blood vessels and decrease the function of the heart muscle
 ek pratirakshi tantra bhi hota he jo ige par nirbhar nahin hota he, parantu yah gyaat nahin he ki kya yah manushyon main bhi utpann hota he
 When anaphylaxis is not caused by the immune system response, the cause of the reaction is the agent that directly destroys mast cells and basophils, causing the secretion of histamine and other substances that are often associated with an allergic reaction

 Anaphylaxis disease is diagnosed based on clinical facts
 jab kisi allergy paidaa karne vaale tatv ke sampark main aane ke kuch minuton / ghanton ke bheetar nimnlikhit teen sthitiyon main se koi bhi ek hoti he to is baat kii sambhaavna bahut adhik he ki vyakti ko anaphilaxis he: If a person has a toxic reaction with an insect sting or medication, it may be useful to test the blood for tryptase or histamine in identifying anaphylaxis disease
 halanki, agar yah khaadya ke kaaran ho yaa vyakti kaa raktchaap saamaanya ho to ye jaanch bahut adhik upyogi nahin hoti hai or ve anaphilaxis rog kii pahchaan kii sambhaavna ko nakaar nahin saktin
 Anaphylaxis has three major characteristics
 anoflactic aghat tab hota he jab puure sharir ke zyaadaatar hisson main rakt vahikaayen chaudee ho jaati he jis kaaran se raktchaap nimna ho jaataa he jo vyakti ke saamaanya raktchaap se kam-se-kam 30% kam yaa maanak maan se 30% kam hota he
 Baphasic anaphylaxis is identified when its symptoms begin to reappear within 1–72 hours, even if the person is not in new contact with the allergenic elements that caused the first reaction
 kuch adhyayan daawa karte hai ki anaphilaxis ke kul maamalon main 20% maamle bifesic hote hai
 Symptoms usually return within 8 hours
 duusari pratikriya kaa upachaar bhi mul anaphilaxis kii tarah hi hota he
 Pseudo-anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions are old names for anaphylaxis that are caused not by an allergic reaction but by direct injury to the mast cells
 world allergy orgenigeshan dwaara upyog kiya jane vaala vartanaam naam “non-immune anaphilaxis” he
 Some people recommend that the old name should no longer be used
 allergy jaanch is baat kaa nirdhaaran karne main sahaayak ho sakati he ki vyakti ko anaphilaxis hone kaa kaaran kya he
 Skin allergy screening is available for certain foods and toxins
 doodh, andey, moongfalee, mewa or machhlee se sambandhit allergy kii pushti ke liye vishisht rog pratikaarakon ke liye kii jane vaali rakt jaanch upyogi ho sakati he
 Skin tests can confirm penicillin allergies, but there is no skin test for other drugs

 There is no skin or blood test for non-immune anaphylaxis
 kabhi-kabhi asthma, oxigen kii kami se murchhit hone ke kaaran or aakasmik bhay se anaphilaxis ko alag se pahchaan paanaa kathin ho jaataa he
 People with asthma usually do not have itching or stomach or intestinal symptoms
 jab koi vyakti murchhit hota he to twachaa pili pad jaati he lekin, usamen dadore nahin hote hai
 a person suffering from sudden fear may have red skin but does not have rashes
 duusari sthitiyaan jinamein aise samaan lakshan ho sakate hai unamem, kharaab machhlee se hone vaali bhojan kii vishaaktata or kuch parjiviyon se hone vaale sankraman shaamil hai
 Avoiding causes that have caused a reaction in the past is the recommended method of prevention of anaphylaxis
 jab aisa sambhav na ho to, aise upachaar bhi hai jinase sharir kaa kisi allergy karne vaale gyaat tatv ke prati pratikriya karnaa band kiya ja saktaa he
 Treatment of the immune system by the Hymenoptera toxins is effective for allergies resulting from bees, wasps, goats, yellowjackets, and fire ants, leading to anesthesia in 80–90% of adults and 98% of children
 doodh, andey, mewa or moongfalee sahit kuch khadyon ke maamle main munkh se liya jane vaala pratiraksha upachaar kuch logon ko samvedanheen karne main prabhavi ho saktaa he; tathaapi aise upachaaron se aksar dushprabhav paidaa hote hai
 Anesthesia is also possible for many medicines, yet most people should avoid only problem-causing drugs

 Anaphylaxis is a type of medical emergency that may require life-saving measures such as respiratory tract management, supplemental oxygen, large amounts of intravenous fluid, and intensive monitoring
 ipinefrine upachaar kaa ek vikalp he
 Antihistamines and steroids are often used in addition to epinephrine
 jab vyakti saamaanya sthiti main aa jaaen to yah sunishchit karne ke liye aspataal main 2 se 24 ghante tak unki nigaraanee kii jaani chahie ki lakshanon kii punrariti na ho kyonki, agar vyakti ko bifesic anaphilaxis ho to aisa phir se ho saktaa he
 Epinephrine is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis
 iskaa upyog na karne kaa koi kaaran nahin he
 It is recommended that epinephrine fluid be injected into the middle forebrain thigh as soon as a suspected condition of anaphylaxis is identified
 yadi vyakti upachaar ke prati behatar pratikriya na de to is injection ko prayek 5 se 15 minute main duharaaya jaae jaataa he
 a second dose is required in 16 to 35% of cases
 do se adhik khuraaqon kii aavashyaktaa bahut hi kam maamalon main padati he
 Intravenous injections are preferred over injections under the skin, in which the drug can be absorbed at a much slower rate
 ipinefrine se hone vaali choti-moti samasyaon main jatke, bechaini, sirdard or dhukdhuki shaamil hai
 Epinephrine is not effective on people who take B-blocker
 is sthiti main, agar ipinefrine prabhavi nahin ho to nason main glucagon diya ja saktaa he
 Glucagon has a function that does not involve β-receptors
 agar aavashyak ho to tanu-taral kaa upyog karke ipinefrine ko nason main bhi diya ja saktaa he
 However, intravenous epinephrine has been linked to irregular heart beats and heart attacks
 anaphilaxis se peedit vyaktiyon ko nason main khud hi ipinefrine inject karne kii suvidha pradaan karne vaala ipinefrine auto injector aam taur par do tarah kii khuraaqon main uplabdh he, ek 25 ki

 Antihistamines are commonly used in addition to epinephrine
 saiddhanthik tarkon par inako prabhavi mana gaya tha lekin is baat ke bahut hi kam sakshya hai ki anaphilaxis ke upachaar main antihistamine vastav main prabhavi he
 The 2007 Cochrane Review found no good quality studies that could be used to recommend it
 shwasan-maarg main taral nirmaan yaa anthan par antihistamine kaa koi bhi prabhaav nahin dekha gaya he
 If the person has anaphylaxis at the present time, there is little chance of any difference from corticosteroids
 uskaa upyog is aashaa se kiya ja saktaa he ki bifesic anaphilaxis kaa khatra kam ho lekin bhavishya main anaphilaxis kii rokthaam karne main isaki prabhavotpadakta anishchit he
 When epinephrine does not relieve symptoms of bronchospasm, salbutamol administered with the help of inhaled medication can be effective
 methilin blue kaa upyog aise vyaktiyon ke liye kiya jaataa he jo duusare upayon par pratikriya nahin karte hai kyonki yah komal nason ko shithil kar saktaa he
 Those who are at risk of anaphylaxis are advised to follow an "allergic action plan"
 bacchon kii allergy kii samasya ke bare main, unke mata-pita ko isaki jaankaree skool ko deni chaiye or yah bhi bataanaa chaiye ki anoclitic apaat sthiti main kya kiya janaa chahie
 Action plans typically include advice on the use of epinephrine auto-injectors, advice on wearing a bracelet with medical alerts, and avoiding motivators that cause such conditions
 kuch niyat paristhitiyon ko paidaa karne vaale prerakon ke liye allergy vaali pratikriya karne vaale padaarth ke prati sharir ko kam samvedansheel banane sambandhi upachaar uplabdh he
 This type of therapy can prevent future anaphylaxis
