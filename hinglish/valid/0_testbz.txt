 Bollywood's Veteran actor Ompuri is no longer with us
 ompuri apni maut se pehle salmaan khan kii film 'tubalite' main kaam kar rahe the jo ki is id relies hone vaali he
 During an interview recently, 'tubelight' director Kabir Khan shared some things related to Ompuri
 unke jane kaa bahut dukh hekabeer khan ne ompuri ko yaad karte hue bataaya ki om puri duniya chhodane se pehle hi is film ke saare seen complit kar chuke the
 There was only one shot left of the 1-day shoot, which we changed very comfortably
 ek tareeke se om ji film complit karne ke baad hamen chhodkar chale gaye or apni yaad main ye aakhri film chhod gaye
 i was very sorry because i had a different relationship with him
 maine unhen film 'kabul express' bhi ofer kii thi jisamen vah ek aatankwaadi kii bhoomika main najar aane vaale the lekin unke doctor ne manaa kar diya kyonki vah ek jarney vaali film thi or om ji ke peeth main kaaphi problem thi
 After that we stayed in touch
 'bajrangi bhaijan' main bhi maine unhen ek role diya jo unhen kaaphi pasand aayaa, unhone us kirdaar ko nibhaayaa bhi lekin kaha ki agali baar mere liye koi bada role likhnaa
 Then i wrote a big role of Banne Mian in 'tubelight', but unfortunately it proved to be his last film
 iske baad jab kabir khan se shahrukh ke chemiyo role ke bare main baat kii gai
 Salman's child actor was told by the reporter Chinese, so what did Jawab Kabir Khan say about Shah Rukh Khan? Kabir said that i have seen many movies and whenever i see a cameo role, i feel very strange
 kabhi-kabhi lagata he ki vah gimic he
 i always wondered what the film would benefit from that cameo role
 lekin film 'tubalite' main mere bheetar se aawaaj ai ki nahin isamen kuch na kuch aisa hona chahie jo alag ho, kyonki yah ek aisa kirdaar he jo lakshmana kaa bahut khyaal rakhata he
 At first we were thinking of another actor for this role, but later i talked to Salman
 tubalite main kemeo ke liye bas ek kol par maan gaye the shahrukh: salmaan khanunhone mujhe shahrukh khan ko is kirdaar ke liye approach karne kii salaah di
 Then Salman himself spoke to Shahrukh
 shahrukh ke skool se padhe hue hai kabirwaise shahrukh khan ke saath meraa ek purana rishta he kyonki unhen main college ke jamaane se jaanata hum
 Even if necessary, i have studied by taking notes of them
 shahrukh ko bhi ye kirdaar turant pasand aayaa
 If you see Salman and Shahrukh Khan in the same film, then a very good scene is seen
 un dinon shahrukh khan 'rais' film ke pramotion main biji the jisaki vajah sonu nigam ek puraa din diya tha or puure din hamane bahut bada shedul rakhkar ke seen ko shoot kiya
 Our entire crew was watching this shooting like an audience
 donon ko dekhnaa kisi jaadu se kam nahin tha
 Salman Khan's 'tubelight' indo-china projectmera will not be lit in Pakistan but it is an Indo China project but i am still developing it but it still has a lot of time
 If this project happens then it will be the first official indo-china project

 pradhanmantri ne bihar ko ab har sambhav sahaayta dene kaa aashwaasan diya he yah jaankaree unhone somvaar der shaam khud bhi twit kar di
 In fact, when the Assembly session was going on on this issue, the Opposition tried to surround the government many times by saying that ultimately what is the matter that neither the Prime Minister nor any Union Minister will take the State to take stock of the flood situation
 Has not been visiting nor has any central team been sent to assess the damage so far
 tabhi mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne khud hi sadan main kaha tha ki abhi tak centre se unhone keval andiaref kii companiyaan food packet baantne ke liye helicopter kii sahaayta maangi he

 But since the Prime Minister's tweet on Monday, it is being said that after the death of more than 150 people this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has come to know about the flood-hit Bihar
 haalanki kai logon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki mangalvaar ko teen talaak bill rajyasabha main pesh hona he or sarkaar ke paas rajyasabha main bahumat nahin he duusari ore uski sahyogi jediu bhi is mudde par sarkaar ke saath nahin aa rahi he
 It is believed that PM Modi has tried to convince JDU President Nitish by calling on the pretext of flood
 aapako bataa den ki bihar main baadh kii sthiti gambhir bani hui he
 The floods in the state have affected 88 lakh people in 13 districts
 rajya aapadaa prabandhan vibhaag ne yah jaankaree di
 However, there was no increase in the number of dead for the third consecutive day
 baadh se ab tak lagbhag 127logon kii mautein hui hai

 Narendra Modi is about to take oath as Prime Minister today
 vahiin is baat kii pushti bhi ho chuki he ki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko modi cabinet main jagah milane vaali he
 After which discussions have started regarding the post of BJP President
 gujarat bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh jitu waghani ne amit shah ko modi mantrimandal main shaamil hone par badhai di he
 With this, it has become clear that Amit Shah will become a minister in the central government
 amit shah sisies ke sadsy banenge
 However, with becoming a minister, Amit Shah will have to leave the post of BJP president
 jiske baad ab bijepi adhyaksh pad ke liye jepi nadda kaa naam surkhiyon main bana hua he
 At the same time, Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan Bhupendra Yadav is also in the race for the post of BJP President
 koun he jepi nadda?jepi nadda amit shah ke vishwaasapaatr maane jate hai
 Jagat Prakash (JP) Nadda has been the Health Minister in the Modi government
 nadda saal 1993 main hue himachal vidhansabha chunaav se raajnneeti main aae
 He also reached the assembly for the first time as an MLA from Bilaspur
 1998 se 2003 tak vah himachal ke swasthya mantri bhi rahe
 At the same time, he was also made the Minister of Forest and Environment, Science and Technology in the Dhumal Government from 2008 to 2010
 april 2012 main unhen rajyasabha ke liye chunaa gaya tha
 Nadda, who started his political career as a leader of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) in 1978, worked for the party's youth wing Bharatiya Yuva Morcha in 1991-94 along with Nitin Gadkari and Amit Shah
 sansadeey chunaav main himachal kii chaaron siten party ke naam karne main unhone mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai he
 In the previous BJP government (2007-12) in Himachal Pradesh, Nadda had to resign as Forest Minister in 2010 due to his differences with the then Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal
 uske baad gadakari ne unhen apni team main shaamil kar liya tha
 He was made the national general secretary of the party
 nadda chhattisgarh ke bhi prabharee hai
 In this year's Lok Sabha elections, he was given the charge of UP
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main bijepi ne uttar pradesh main badhiya pradarshan darj kiya he
 At the same time, in 2014, JP Nadda's name appeared for the post of BJP President
 haalanki tab amit shah bijepi adhyaksh banaae gaye the
 JP Nadda is believed to have a strong hold in the organization
 koun hai bhoopendra yadavabhoopendra yadav bijepi sanghathan main kai ahm jimmedaariyaan nibhaa chuke hai
 Currently, apart from being a Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan, Yadav is also playing the responsibility of the post of National General Secretary in the organization
 iske alaava unke paas bihar kaa bhi daayitv he
 Bhupendra Yadav has also held important responsibilities in Gujarat
 saal 2013 main rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav main pramukh ranneetikaar kii bhoomika bhi sambhaal chuke he
 Also, he is seen as close to former CM of Rajasthan Vasundhara Raje
 multya haryana ke gudgaanv ilaake ke nivasee yadav ke pita lambey samay tak railway main ajmer main karyrat rahe hai
 Bhupendra Yadav was also born in Ajmer and during his advocacy came in contact with BJP leader Arun Jaitley
 jiske baad se hi inkaa siyaasi safar shuru hua
 Jaitley had entrusted the responsibility related to the Ram temple case to Yadav
 iske baad se hi sangh or bijepi main yadav kii pahunch oonche str tak bani
 He was also a National Minister in the BJP organization in the year 2010
 narendra modi cabinet ne 3 april ko ek baar phir se bhoomi adhigrahan (sanshodhit) adhyadesh 2015 jari kar diya
 One of the benefits that the government is counting on its ordinance is that institutions working for the defense of the country should be able to gain land
 isiilie raksha santhaan ke daayre main raksha upkaran banane vaale kaarkaanon or anya sansthaaon ko bhi jod diya gaya he
 Now, along with the army, the compulsion to acquire land for these institutions also includes environmental studies, social audits, consent of farmers and no obligation to take multiple land
 adhyadesh kaa virodh karne vaale bhi anya muddon par to hallaa machaa rahe hai, lekin desh kii raksha kaa maamla aisi shpavitra gay he jis par koi bolne ko raji nahin
 The ground reality is the opposite
 jis raksha mantralay ko or zyada jameen dilaane ke liye sarkaar betaab he, vah pehle se hi desh kaa sabase bada jameendaar he
 17
 3 lakh acre jameen ke maalik raksha mantralay ke paas na sirf apni jarurat se 81,000 acre jameen zyada he, balki vah pehle se adhigrahit kii gai 50,000 acre se zyada jameen kaa ab tak koi istemaal hi nahin kar sakaa he
 Not only this, there is about 26,000 acres of land that the Ministry of Defense no longer considers fit for its work and has considered it abandoned
 mantralay na to is jameen kaa koi upyog karata he or na kisi or kaam ke liye hi uplabdh karaata he
 5,000 for the merriment of the top military officers responsible for protecting the country in which the farmer cultivates the crop by watering a small piece of land with his own blood and sweat and after the weather strikes There are 97 golfcores running on more than an acre
 inamen se kai golfcorse aise hai jinke paas kitni jameen he, isaki jaankaree dena bhi mantralay jaruri nahin samajhataa
 Look at the fun, when the question arose as to how the golf course would come under the purview of military needs, in 2006, the army chief declared the golf courses to be the Army's environmental park
 ye saare tathy bharat ke niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak (sieji) ne raksha mantralay kii parisampatti par 25 march, 2011 ko sansad main pesh report main saarvajanik kar die the
 Subsequently, in December 2013, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament, chaired by senior BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi, also approved the CAG revelations
 vartmaan paryaavaran or van rajyamantri (swatantra prabhaar) prakaash jaavdekar bhi is samit ke sadsy the
 Both the organizations in their recommendation said that the asset management of the defense ministries is very poor and needs to be changed
 donon kii raay main thodaa-sa fark haih sieji ne apni sifarish main kaha ki atirikt jameen kaa istemaal lok kalyaan ke duusare kaamon main kiya jaae, jabaki murali manohar joshi kii adhyakshata vaali piesi ne kaha ki is jameen kaa istemaal sena ke hi duusare kalyankari kaaryon main kiya jaae
 The interesting thing here is that after scrutinizing the two entities for years, the presence of additional land was acknowledged, counting the specifics of its mismanagement, but nowhere did the Ministry of Defense need more land to protect the country
 lekin raksha mantralay in baton ko nahin maanata
 At the time of preparation of the CAG report, the then officials of the Ministry of Defense refused to have additional land and in the current budget session of Parliament, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar clearly said, "the Defense Ministry does not have any additional land
 jo bhi jameen he vah raksha kaaryon ke upyog ke liye he
 The government also argues that foreign companies will have to be invited to promote "make in India" in the defense sector and land will be needed for units to develop new manufacturing and technology
 vaise, sieji or piesi ke mutabik desh main 25 sena stesan aise hai, jinamein se 9 steshnon par local military athurities (leme) ke record main dephence estate aficers (diio) ke record kii tulana main 12,769 acre jameen zyada pai gai, vahiin baaki steshnon par yahi jameen 9,427 acre kam pai gai
 That is, there is no concrete record of how much land the army has
 sena kii jameen kaa hisaab-kitaab is kadar bikharaa hua he ki 2006 se puure chah saal chalane ke baad aktubar 2011 main records ke digilitigeshan vaala oparation ''raksha bhoomi'' puraa hua tab bhi sateek record darj nahin ho sake
 Perhaps the way the army works is different
 tabhi to raksha mahakama jameen ke istemaal ko lekar jo ziddee ravaiya apana rahaa he, usase kahin talkh ravaiya chhavnee prashasan ke antargat aane vaale ilaakon ke sanchaalan main dikhaa rahaa he
 Last year, many roads in most cantonment areas were permanently closed in the name of safety
 isse 2 lakh acre jameen main faile 62 cantonments main rah rahi 50 lakh kii aabaadi ke liye sankat khadaa ho gaya
 Ministry of Defense Director (L&C) Nitin Chayende wrote a letter to the heads of the three services and the Director General of Defense Assets on 7 January 2015, stating that there have been complaints of large scale closure of common roads in cantonment areas

 australia ne apane visphotak ballebaaj aaron finch kii sirf 63 gendon kaa saamana kar kheli gai 11 chaukon or 14 chhakkon se saji 156 ran kii vishwarecord pari kii badaulat do maichon kii shrunkhlaa ke pehle tii-20 antarrashtriya match main mejabaan england ko 39 ran se dho daalaa
 247
 61 ke avishsaneey strike rate se kheli gai is dhamaakedaar pari main aaron finch ne na sirf tinti-20 antarrashtriya cricket main sabase bade vyaktigat score ke record ko todaa, balki uske dwaara thoke gaye 14 chakke bhi ek pari main sarvaadhik hai
 Earlier, the record for the highest individual score in T20 international cricket was for New Zealand's Brandon mccullum, who scored an innings of 123 runs against Bangladesh
 iske alaava aaron finch kaa yah shatak tii-20 cricket ke itihaas kaa doosraa sabase tej shatak he
 Finch scored his 100th run off 47th ball, while Richard Levy hit a century in just 45 balls against New Zealand
 vaise, cricket ke kisi bhi format main sabase kam gendon main shatak kaa record pakistan ke shahid aafridi ke naam darj he, jisane ek-divasiy antarrashtriya match main sirf 37 gendon main 100 ran kaa aankada chuaa tha
 Aaron Finch's 'de Danadan' mood, which started the innings with a six on the first ball, is the biggest proof that he crossed every important stage of his innings with a six
 kangaaroon kii pari main lage kul 18 main se 14 chakke thokane vaale finch ne apane 50 ran (26veen gend) chakka lagaakar puure kiye, apana shatak (47veen gend) bhi chakke se banaaya, brandan mackulam kaa record bhi chakke se hi todaa, or 150 ran kaa aankada bhi chakke se hi chuaa
 By the way, even though this is the second fastest T20 century in the world, it is not only the fastest T20 century by Australia, but also the first and only century by the Kangaroos in T20 international cricket
 is also
 tippaniyan England had, in fact, decided to field first by winning the toss in this match, but Kangaroo opener Finch proved his decision to be a fool
 aaron finch kii is aitihaasik pari kii madad se australia ko pichley saat maheene main pehali baar antarrashtriya cricket ke kisi bhi format main pehali jeet hasil hui he, or is jeet se isi daure par ashes shrunkhlaa main 3-0 se mili karaari haar ke zakhm par kuch maraham laga hoga
 With this innings, Aaron Finch became the 10th batsman to score a century in T20 international cricket, and this helped Australia lift a mountain of 248 for six wickets in 20 overs, and England batsman Joe Root Despite an unbeaten 90 runs, only 209 runs could be scored
 247
 Aaron Finch not only broke the record for the biggest individual score in Twenty20 international cricket in this blazing innings at an unbelievable strike rate of 61, but the 14 sixes he bowled were also the most in an innings
 isse pehle, tii-20 antarrashtriya cricket main sabase bade vyaktigat score kaa record newzealand ke brandan mackulam ke naam tha, jinhone bangladesh ke khilaaf 123 ranon kii pari kheli thi
 Also, this century of Aaron Finch is the second fastest century in the history of T20 cricket
 finch ne apana 100waan ran 47veen gend par banaaya, jabaki isse pehle newzealand ke khilaaf richard levi ne sirf 45 gendon main shatak thok daalaa tha
 By the way, the record of the lowest balls century in any format of cricket is recorded by Shahid Afridi of Pakistan, who touched 100 runs in just 37 balls in a one-day international
 pehali hi gend par chakka jadkar pari kii shuruyaat karne vaale aaron finch ke 'de danaadan' vaale mood kaa yahi sabase bada saboot he ki unki pari kaa har mahatvapurn padaav unhone chakke se hi paar kiya
 Finch, who hit 14 sixes out of a total of 18 in the Kangaroos' innings, completed his 50 runs (26th ball) with a six, also scored his century (47th ball) with a six, broke Brandon mccullum's record with a six, and 150
 The run figure was also touched by sixes
 vaise, bhale hi duniya main yah doosraa sabase tej tii-20 shatak he, lekin australia kii ore se na sirf yah sabase tej tii-20 shatak he, balki yah kangaaroon kii ore se tii-20 antarrashtriya cricket main thoka gaya pehla or ekmaatr shatak bhi he
 The comments england ne darasal, is match main toss jitkar pehle fielding karne kaa faisla kiya tha, lekin kangaroo salaami ballebaaj finch ne unke is faisle ko katai bevakoofana sabit kar diya
 With the help of Aaron Finch's historic innings, Australia has won for the first time in any format of international cricket for the first time in the last seven months, and this victory has led to a 3–0 loss in the Ashes series on this tour
 Must have had some ointment
 is pari ke saath hi aaron finch tii-20 antarrashtriya cricket main shatak thokane vaale 10wein ballebaaj ban gaye, or iske boote australia ne 20 over main chah wicket ke nuksaan par 248 ranon kaa pahaad khadaa kiya, or jawaab main england ke ballebaaj jo root ke naabad 90 ranon ke baavjood kul 209 ran hi bana sake

 mahilaayein purushon kii apeksha na sirf kisi se bhi behatar dhang se baatcheet kar sakati hai balki apni baat dusron ke saath share karne se bhi nahin kataraati hai
 When women are unable to get along with their husbands, then they feel the need to share their heart's words with someone else
 isse na keval unki jindagi main sahaj aavashyaktaaon kii purti hoti he, balki unki jindagi main utsaah, umang or tarang bhi jaagti he, jo unki rojaanaa kii vaivaahik jindagi se gaayab rahati he
 Miss Soleen Palliot, the marketing specialist of Gleiden, the first dating website for married women, says, "when sex becomes a daily routine in marriage, the love affair that brings happiness and excitement to women in their lives is given to them by God Gaya seems to be a boon or gift
 syndi lopper kaa geet 'girls just waant tu haev fan' hamen yah bhalee-bhaanti samajha detaa he ki asafal shaadi se hairaan-pareshaan bahut si mahilaon ke kisi or se afaire hote hai, kyonki unki shaadi main koi majaa or moujmasti kaa mauka baaki nahin rahata or unki jindagi ekadam neeras or bojhil ho jaati he
 "talking to IANS, she said that husband and wife live parallel lives because of their busy schedule
 unke is lifestil se donon ko aapas main baatcheet karne kaa koi samay nahin mil paata
 Even on weekends and holidays, they remain disconnected from each other
 bacchon ke janm ke baad kai patniyon ke prati unke pati kaa pyaar pehle jaisai nahin rahata or unhen ek bachche kii maa ke rup main dekhne lagate hai
 He does not see them as his wife or girlfriend
 miss soline ne kaha ki is sthiti ko jhel rahi mahilaon ke man main avsaad or niraashaa panpane lagati he
 Women want love and intimacy from their husbands and when women do not get this intimacy in their lives, they have no choice but to seek love outside of marriage
 unhone kaha ki mahilaon ke liye asafal shaadi kii sthiti ko jhelane se zyada bura kuch nahin hota
 In a marriage where there is lack of intimacy and love and desire of the husband, there is a lot of physical and mental consequences on women
 bharat main talaak ke badhate maamle aadhunik vishwa kaa lakshan he
 Many times, the institution of marriage cannot be reconciled with the modern lifestyle
 aise samay main shaadi se baahar prem sambandh banane ke plateform mahilaon ko unki ubaau or asafal shaadiyon se bachaate hai
 Using these platforms, women can find partners like them, whose interests and habits are similar to them

 In May this year, Masood Azhar was also declared an international terrorist
 centre kii modi sarkaar kii ore se 17veen loksabhaa ke pehle satr main amit shah ne 8 july ko yuapie bill ko loksabhaa main pesh kiya tha
 The Unlawful Activities (prevention) Act (UAPA) bill was passed in both the houses
 iske tahat centre sarkaar ke paas kisi vyakti ko aatankwaadi ghoshit karne or unki sampatti jabt karne kaa adhikaar aa gaya he
 Under this bill, the government can identify those who are involved in terrorist activities or in any way promote terror

 However, the opposition strongly opposed the bill as they said that this law gives the government the authority to declare anyone a terrorist, which can lead to its misuse

 a team at the Warton School of Pennsylvania University in the United States found that people who take their time out for others feel that they do not have the time and this feeling makes them more effective
 adhyayan dal ke aguva kisi mogilnar ne bataaya, ‘aap jab vakt kii kami mahasoos kar rahe hon aise main apana keemtee vakt auron ko dena ajeeb-sa lag saktaa he, lekin hamaara anusandhan bataata he ki dusron ke kaam aayaa thodaa-sa samay bhi logon ko prabhavi mahasoos kara saktaa he or unhen yah lagata he ki kam samay main bhi ve kaaphi kuch kar sakate hai
