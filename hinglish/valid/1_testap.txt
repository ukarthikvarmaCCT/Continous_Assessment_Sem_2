 Showing a little leniency on the common man, the government has decided not to increase the rail fare this year
 rail mantri mallikarjun khadge ne kaha ki dijal kii keemat main vruddhi hone ke baavjood vittvarsh 2013-14 ke liye rail kiraye main vruddhi nahin kii jaaegi
 Kharge told reporters, "there is no proposal to increase rail fares again this year and the Railways will bear the additional expenses due to the increased diesel prices
" dijal kii keemton main kaaphi badhotaree ho chuki he
 'after a change in the passenger fares of the railways by the previous Railway Ministers for the last decade, the then Railway Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal increased the passenger fares from January 22 to compensate for an additional Rs 6,600 crore per year
 khadge ne aage bataaya, 'ham dijal kii keemton main aage hone vaali badhotaree ko bhi sahan karenge, lekin yatri kiraye main vruddhi nahin karenge
 This statement of the Railway Minister came after the sixth increase in diesel prices this year due to frequent breakdown of rupee dollar

 Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi indicated the possibility of considering an amendment in the rail passenger fares with no increase in the last eight years
 trivedi ne kaha, ‘kiraaye par vichaar karne kaa nishchit taur par maamla banataa he jisamen pichley aath varshon se koi vruddhi nahin kii gai he
 "earlier, when asked about the possibility of increase in rail fares, Trivedi told," Increasing fares (raising funds) is not the solution
 hamen garibon ke bare main sochna chahie
 Trivedi stressed the need to repair all the infrastructure of the railway and rebuild the system with modern technology to increase the level of security
 rail mantri ke ye bayaan aise samay aaye hai jab railway kai haadason or vittiya sankat se jujh rahaa he jisase isaki kai pariyojnaayen ataki hui hai
 The Railway Minister believes that a good business structure is necessary at this time to raise funds for the Railways
 unhone kaha,‘hamane jis tarah se vimaanan kshetra kaa punarnirmaan kiya he, usee tarah puri railway pranali kaa punarnirmaan karnaa he
 We need technical intervention which is very necessary
 ’trivedi ne saath hi kaha ki bhartiya railway ko raajnneetik hastkshepon se bilkul alag karne kii bhi jarurat he taaki ise peshewar rup diya ja sake
 He said the problem is that when the Railway Minister changes, the system changes

 What Yasir Usman said The writer of rekha-the Untold Story has denied the news and said that perhaps people have not read the book properly
 hangaamaa: kya rekha kii maang main he sanjay dutt ke naam kaa sindooryasir ne kaha ki ek samay par rekha or sanjay dutt ek film kii shooting kar rahe the

 jaishankar ne missile technology control regim (emticiar) par hastakshar kar die or is tarah bharat is vishesh club kaa 35waan sadsy ban gaya
 It was a victory for India in a way as it was set up in 1987 against India and other emerging countries to prevent them from buying the technical and material needed for nuclear missile manufacturing
 bharat kaa isamen pravesh isliye bhi khaas he kyonki kai koshishon ke baavjood china abhi tak iskaa sadsy nahin ban sakaa he
 Successful in MTCR, failure in NSG, where the diplomatic and scientific section in India felt proud of the achievement, the Indian government was silent as its claim to membership of the Nuclear Supply Group (NSG) received a major push
 48 sadasyon ke enesji kii sthapana 1974 main bharat ke pehle parmaanu pareekshanon ke maddenjar kii gai thi or iske tahat sakht niyam banaae gaye jinase iske sadsy un deshon ke saath parmaanu kaarobaar ko anjaam nahin de sakate jinhone parmaanu aprasar sandhi (enpiti) par hastakshar nahin kiye hai
 India had put in full force before that in the NCG meeting that lasted from 20-24 June in Seoul, India fought a tremendous and exhausting battle to become its member
 is saal may main bharat ne isaki sadsyta ke liye aupchaarik aavedan kiya tha
 China, who became a member of the NSG in 2004, stood as a wall in front of him and led the campaign against India engaged in building a consensus for itself
 haalanki sadsy raashtra bharat ke saath kaarobaar jari rakh sakate hai kyonki enesji ne 2008 main bharat ko vishesh chhot di thi jo bharat-america asainya parmaanu samjhaute ke baad use mili thi
 Yet it was undisputed that the result in Seoul was a major setback for India's diplomatic efforts
 vipaksh ne sarkaar ko gheraavipakshi dalon ne turant is mudde ko lapka or pradhanmantri narendra modi kii 'kharaab timming,' shor-sharabe vaali kootnithik bhul ko aade haathon lenaa shuru kar diya
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi tweeted, 'NSG: How Narendra Modi let the negotiations go by hand
 jab bharat ke paas pehle se hi chhot he, aise main enesji ke liye bharat ke prayaason par buddhijiviyon or purv rajanyikon ne sawalia nishaan lagaaya
 However, the biggest question remained in its place: Why did India try so much for full membership of NSG? Did the Modi government deal with negative people, especially China, correctly? India Today spoke to various officials associated with India's campaign regarding the NSG and the inside story showed that it was not a diplomatic outburst, as it is being told, but rather a thought-provoking and bold move
 jaaniye kaise
 Should India push for NSG membership? The most criticized is that India is already exempted from NSG, so to get what is called 'second class membership' What was the need to work hard, which would not give any privilege
 varisht rajanyik satyabrat paal ne da hindu main likhaah 'enesji jaisi gaiyr-mahatvapurn cheez ke liye yah unmaad, kootneeti nahin balki naadaani thi
 'this article, written with the arguments of the Counsel of Courage, overlooks many essentials that India has had to face during its journey of NSG membership

 He ignored his party's opposition to the indo-us nuclear deal and Modi took steps towards implementing commitments and provisions with lofty intentions and his bilateral approach needs to be appreciated
 antarrashtriya manchon par koshishen tejasbase ahm praathamiktaaon main yah he ki enesji samet tamaam tarah kii parmaanu nishedh vyavasthaaon kaa sadsy banane kii bharat kii koshishen tej kii jaaen jis par roak is makasad se lagaai ja rahi he taaki mahavinashkari hathiyaaron ke khilaaf surakshatmak upaay viksit karne kii bharat kii koshishen dhimi pad jaaen yaa ruk jaaen
 In November 2010, US President Barack Obama promised Manmohan Singh that the US would work towards making India a full member of the NSG and a member of the other three non-proliferation systems
 ye teen vyavasthaaen haih australia group (rasinic jaivik hathiyaaron ke prasar par niyantran), vasenar arrangement (dohare istemaal kii vasteen or takneekee ke niryaat par niyantran) or emticiar
 Trymodi's team started in 2011 and found that Manmohan Singh's government tried since 2011 to become a member of the four non-proliferation systems, but for many reasons, its efforts remained digestive
 videsh mantralay ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha, ''vah us samay kaa nitigat faisla tha lekin hamane ek hi vakt main kai taraf haath aajamaae jo hamaare bas main nahin tha
 All four systems require special administrative and legal measures, for which a coordination will have to be made in different ministries
 lihaaja yah asambhav-sa tha
 "instead of trying directly for the target India at the same time for the four, Modi's team decided to prioritize and topped the membership of NSG and MTCR
 enesji par duusari chintaaon ke alaava yah tathy bhi he ki 2008 main upie-1 sarkaar ne daawa kiya tha ki enesji se use ''saaf chhot" mili hui thi
 But that situation changed after three years when UPA-2 was in power
 2011 main enesji ne apane disha-nirdeshon ko sanshodhit kiya or sabhi sadasyon ko aise desh ke saath parmaanu sanvardhan or punarsansanskaran takanic main vyapaar karne par pratibandh laga diya, jisane enpiti par dastakhat na kiye hon
 India has been refusing to sign the NPT since its inception in 1968 and has described it as discriminatory
 matlab yah hua ki enesji ke sanshodhan ke nishane par sidhe-sidhe bharat tha
 What is the attitude of Western countries? On opposing India, the US, Russia and France issued a statement that they are ready to provide India a 'complete nuclear fuel cycle' as per their agreement despite the new guidelines of NSG
 lekin ek adhikari bataate hai, 'yah hamaare tab ke niti-nirmaataaon ko samaj lenaa chahie tha ki enesji apane niyam badal saktaa he or ham use maanane ko majaboor ho sakate hai
 So it was important that we either sit with the decision-making congregation or wait outside and we were told that we can or cannot
 'upie-2 kyon nahin kar pai?modi ko salaah di gai ki enesji sadsyta keliye har tarah ke ghode khol dijie
 The reason was that Obama would have to fulfill his promise and the US administration would be forced to do as he did in 2008
 upie-2 ke aakhri varshon ke halaat ke maddenjar bharat-america rishton main thodaa khinchaav mahasoos kiya jane laga tha
 So, despite being hurt by the American attitude of refusing visas after the 2002 Gujarat riots, Modi immediately took a major step to improve indo-american relations and set up a personal relationship with Obama in his first meeting with Obama in September 2014

 In the nuclear business, big players like Europe, Korea and Japan said that if India becomes a member then it will be easy and it will not be difficult to keep the investment promise

 An Indian official present there described it as a "snake-dagger-like situation"
 ham is prakriya ko sahmati banane tak shuru nahin kar sakate the or prakriya shuru na hone se sahmati banane ke liye kaam nahin kar sakate the
 "however, apart from the meeting, Australia organized an event in which India made its presentation regardless of China's opposition
 48 main 24 sadsy desh rajamand thevidesh mantralay kii team dilli lauti to usne yah jayja liya ki 48 sadasyon kaa rukh kya he
 In his assessment, 24 were agreeable, but the rest were either silent or wanted to put a condition for membership
 sirf mutthi bhar iskaa virodh karte dikh rahe the
 a simple majority was not enough for India's claim
 enesji main har faisla sarvanumati se liya jaataa he or ek sadsy ke virodh se bhi koi prastaav ruk saktaa he
 Therefore, the Ministry of External Affairs sent messengers to all NSG members at the level of Secretary
 banaai gai thi vaarta kii ranneetiyah bhi faisla kiya gaya ki videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj or pradhanmantri se kuch rajya pramukhon or mantriyon se khud baat karne ko kaha jaae
 In this way, Swaraj himself spoke to the foreign ministers of 26 countries
 pradhanmantri ne 12 rajdhyakshon or mantriyon se baat kii
 In addition, he scheduled tours to countries such as Ireland, Switzerland and Mexico
 taaki ve vahaan bharat ke enesji daawey ke liye samarthan juta saken
 Why did Modi raise the stakes so high? In response to this criticism, an official says, "it is not fair to say that the Prime Minister did a lot of publicity for the campaign
 ve desh kii bhalaai ke liye do kadam aage bad jate hai
 "the PAK also submitted the claim
 On May 10, Jaishankar formally submitted an application for India's 300-page NSG membership to NSG Chairman Grossi and urged that it be considered at the annual conference in Seoul on June 20-24
 
 ek pakhwaade baad pakistan ne bhi enesji ke liye apana aupchaarik aavedan peshkar diya
 Clearly, Pakistan had China's support
 lekin bharat ke mukaable pakistan ke paas yah dikhaane kii koi yogyata nahin thi ki vah parmaanu birdari kaa jimmedaar sadsy he
 Her top nuclear scientist A
 kyuu
 Khan is accused of selling nuclear secrets to North Korea and Iran
 bharat ke vipareet usne sainya or asainya parmaanu sanyantron ko alag-alag bhi nahin kiya he yaa ieie ke jaruri kaayadon kaa paalan bhi nahin kiya he
 Pakistan's application to the NSG was considered by the rest of the members as part of China's effort to block India's claim
 bharat ko pataa tha ki use lambii ladaai ladgai he
 China was willing to go to any lengths to stop India
 2016 kaa prayaas 2008 kii enesji kamyaabi se alag kyon?modi sarkaar kii enesji sadsyta ke daawey ke liye ''manamaane" ravaie kii aalochana ho rahi he or use manmohan singh tathaa unki team ke ''chupchaap" samarthan hasil kar lene ke tareeke ke bainks rakhkar dekha ja rahaa he
 It is not that during UPA-1 there was no hue and cry to get the exemption
 us samay sahyogi dalon se kaaphi virodh jhelana padaa tha or antatru vampanthi partiyaan alag ho gayi
 He accused the Prime Minister of being the puppet of America
 2008 main china kaa alag tha ravaiyachin ne tab bhi bharat kaa virodh kiya tha lekin itnaa khulkar nahin
 In 2008, China had told India alone that it would not oppose if India gained the support of other members
 us samay palada is vajah se jhuk gaya tha kyonki jorge bush ne hu jintao se baat kii thi or bharat ke samarthan kaa aagrah kiya tha
 Xi government changed strategy What has changed the case for China since 2008? For one thing, in 2016, China has a different attitude
 2013 main hu jintao se kaman sanbhaalane ke baad shi jinping ne majboot videsh niti kii neenv rakhi
 The cleverness and caution of Hu's era have now passed
 yah china ke america se sambandhon ke bare main zyada khulkar jaahir hota he
 The central element of Xi's diplomacy is to establish a new kind of powerful relationship with America
 iskaa arth yah he ki china ab donon deshon ko barabari ke saath dekhtaa he
 China is now ready to stand in front of America in a way that was not there before and now America does not run on China like it used to
 is badlaav ko bharat ko samajhane kii jarurat he
 The strategy to deal with aggressive China Many people in China are still not happy with the decision that in 2008 it agreed to exempt India from NSG under pressure from the US
 shanghai institute for international studies ke south asia studies ke diarector, varisht ranneetik visheshgy jhaao gaancheng ne india today se kaha, ''2008 main america ne badi koshish kii or aakhir main bharat ko vishesh riyaayat dilaane main kaamyaab ho gaya
 Is this still possible today? i can not say for sure
 " bhartiya team nai antarrashtriya sachaaiyon se waakif thi or usne sirf america par bharosa karne ke alaava or bhi bahut kuch kiya
 He also knew that this time he faced an aggressive China
 jo antarrashtriya vyavastha ko prabhavit karne kebhale kaabil na ho magar adnga laga saktaa he
 The other major change in Chinese diplomacy that stands with Pakistan is that it seems willing to go to any length for its "evergreen" friend Pakistan
 vah ab bharat se rishton main santulan banane kaa prayaas bhi karata nahin dikhataa
 In Beijing, Pakistan is being described as China's only friend
 shi ke rajkaaj sanbhaalane ke baad kuch varshon main china kii sarkari media pakistan ko ''ba taai" yaa ''jigari dost" bataane lagi he
 Xi has made his ambitious Silk Route initiative a central case for building an economic corridor in Pakistan
 iske tahat vah bharat ke virodh ke baavjood pakistan adhikrut kashmir se sadak or urja pariyojnaon ke liye coridor banane kii yojana bana chukaa he
 The most worrying thing for India is that for the first time after nearly a decade, China's policies have been formulated keeping Pakistan in mind
 ek varisht kutanyik kehete hai, ''vidambnaa yah he ki jab hamane china or pakistan ko alag-alag karke dekhnaa shuru kiya, tab china ne pakistan ke saath hamen jod diya
 "this is also evident in the case of NSG
 china se jari rahi vaartachin kaa samarthan hasil karne ke liye raashtrapati pranab mukherjee se may ke pichley hafte main daure ke dauraan shi se sahyog maangane kaa aagrah karne ko kaha gaya
 Jaishankar who accompanied him also spoke to the Chinese Foreign Secretary and the Foreign Minister
 bataaya jaataa he ki china ne kaha
 That "we cannot open, but are not even closed, in the matter of NSG membership of India
" " uske baad tseol main enesji kii baithak ke kuch din pehle videsh sachiv ne beijing kaa gopneey daura kiya, jise india today pehali baar jaahir kar rahaa he
 It is said that China told Jaishankar, "we are ready to take a positive view of India
" lekin yah lambey samay main sirf bharat ke maamle main hi nahin ho saktaa
 "china's position was unclear: we will give you entry, but do not obstruct the entry of Pakistan
 china kii chintaa yah thi ki bharat enesji main pravesh paane ke baad pakistan ke liye adnga lagayegaa
 It was a chance for India, a better chance for India
 modi kii team ko yakeen tha ki enesji ke pravesh ke liye daravaaje khul jaaen to bharat ke liye vahaan dheron maukey hai
 He also realized that because of his poor record there was no scope for Pakistan to enter until he cleared his case
 iske alaava, kuch deshon ne jaahir kiya he ki pakistan ko enesji sadsyta kaa chugga dekar uske parmaanu mahatvakankshaon par lagaam lagaana behatar he
 Swaraj asserted in his annual press conference in Delhi a day before the NSG meeting in Seoul, India's steadfast response, that "china is not obstructing India's membership of the NSG
" vah sirf sharton or prakriya kii baat kar rahaa he
 i hope we convince China to support our NSG membership
 " jahaan tak pakistan ke aavedan kii baat he to us bare main unhone kaha ki bharat abhi sadsy nahin he, isliye kuch kah nahin saktaa
 But he also made it clear, "we will not impose any entry into any country in the NSG
" " or ''har desh ko uski paatrata ke aadhaar par vichaar kiya janaa chahie
 "china: The Case of the Strangulation When Jaishankar and Amandeep Singh Gill, Joint Secretary in charge of Nuclear Affairs at the Ministry of External Affairs were flying to Seoul for a full session of the NSG, they were confident that India would cross India if China kept its promise
 lekin ve koi kasar nahin chhod rahe the
 He divided the members of the NSG into five groups
 mul samooh himachati deshon kaa tha, jisamen america, rus, japan, canada, britain, germany or australia shaamil the
 These countries were ready not only to support India but also to convince others to come together
 phir ''zyada bada samarthak samooh" tha jisamen mote taure par purvi europe, madhya asia or netherlands or belgium sareekhe pashchimi europe ke kuch desh the
 Altogether, 38 out of 48 countries fell into these two groups
 maanak ko paalan karne ke paksh main the kai deshbaaki bache 10 deshon main se brazil, switzraland or turki sahit chah desh tisare samooh main the
 These were the countries that believed in what was called the "soft process"
 ye desh baithak main bharat kaa samarthan karne ke liye taiyaar the basharte enesji main saath hi saath bharat or pakistan sareekhe gaiyr-enpiti sadasyon ko daakhila dene kii kasuti par sahmati banaai jaae
 There were three countries in the fourth group — Austria, New Zealand and Ireland
 inhen aise deshon ke khaane main rakhaa gaya, jo ''sakht prakriya" chaahate the
 He was not against the membership of India but wanted to decide the right course
 unka kahana tha ki pehle kasuti yaa maandand tay hona chahie or phir uske baad hi bharat kii yaa kisi bhi duusari arji par vichaar kiya janaa chahie
 China's opposition was completely different and unique and was therefore placed in a group of 1
 vah taiyaar tha lekin tabhi jab pakistan kii arji par bhi vichaar kiya jaae
 But within a day, when China saw that very few NSG members wanted to consider Pakistan's case, it changed its stand
 sidhaa adnga lagane par utar aayaa chinaek bhartiya afasar ke lafjon main, ''linkage se blockege" main badal liya
 That is, instead of protesting by connecting with anything else, he came down on a direct hurdle
 china ne pehle prakriyaagat daanvpech kaa sahaara liya or adhyaksh (kaman ab dakshin korea ne sambhaal lee thi) se kaha ki bharat kaa aavedan kaarysoochee main nahin he isliye is par charchaa nahin kii ja sakati
 India's defending countries retaliated and forced the president to agree to a discussion
 iske baad china ne aisa daanv chalaa jisane bharat kii baaji palat di
 China is believed to have persuaded South Korea to pass a deadly verdict
 or vah faisla yah tha ki bharat kii arji par charchaa to hogi lekin isamen koi faisla nahin hoga
 Efforts to strengthen China continued: As soon as the president gave the decision of these rules, India knew that the chances of his admission in this period were almost zero
 phir bhi shanghai sahyog sanghathan (essio) ke shikhar sammelan ke haashiye par shi ke saath apni mulaakaat main enesji ke liye bharat ke maamle par ''nishpaksh" or ''vastuparak" dhang se vichaar karne kaa nivedan karke modi ne ooncha daanv khel diya tha
 India has not given up hope, in the meantime, with no decision being made, some of the countries who have pledged to support India talked about setting the criteria for filing non-npt members
 china ne iskaa hawala dete hue kaha ki isse duusare sadasyon ke virodh kaa sanket miltaa he
 But India has not given up hope
 india today se jaishankar ne kaha, ''darwaja khulaa hua he or ham is raste par badhate rahenge
 "jaishankar hopes that India will get membership of NSG
 ve kehete hai, ''ham china samet enesji ke sadsy deshon kaa samarthan hasil karne ke liye tark or vivek kaa or manaane kii apni shaktiyon kaa istemaal karte rahenge
 / p> - Anant Krishnan, in Beijing china ne vahi kiya jisaki pehle se hi ashanka thi
 He has broken his promise and put a dagger in India's back
 doklam par samjhaute ke sava maheene bhi nahin beete hai ki usne dhokhe kii daastaan likh daali
 Breaking the August 28 agreement, it has deployed a large number of troops near Doklam
 myanmar ke doklam pathaar se china kii giddh drushti abhi tak hati nahin thi
 He had created an illusion of this by compromising to repel the soldiers
 china yaa to samajhataa nahin he yaa sochataa nahin he yaa phir sudharne ko taiyaar nahin he
 Well, whatever he has mocked international relations, he is an example to the world
 modi kii beijing yatra ke baad phir rang main aayaa dragonpradhanmantri narendra modi kii beijing yatra ke baadachin doklam par phir se apane puraane rang main aa gayaahai
 China has broken its promise made last month
 usne vaada kiya tha ki bharat or china apane-apane sainikon ko peeche hataa lenge or doklam main phir dakhal nahin denge
 China seems to be intent on testing India's patience once again
 china ne na sirf doklam main phir se apane sainikon kii tainaati kii he, balki unki taadaad lagaataar badhaata ja rahaa he
 The last time it lasted for 73 days was the escalation between the forces of India and China for 73 days in this area
 28 agast ko pradhanmantri narendra modi kii china yatra se pehle ek samjhaute ke tahat donon deshon ne sainya vivaad ko sulajhane kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin china ne us vaade kii peeth main khanjar bhonk daalaa he
 On Thursday, PM Modi had mentioned Doklam during his speech on Thursday, the Prime Minister had patted his back for resolving the Doklam dispute
 unhone kaha tha ki kuch log doklam prakaran par niraashaa failaa rahe hai
 However, the fact is that China was building roads in Doklam and wants to complete it in a hurry
 usne saare sajo saamaan utaar die the or kaam bhi shuru kar diya tha, lekin bharat ke sainikon ne sara kaam roak diya tha
 The dragon had threatened the war till the soldiers of both the countries came face to face and after that the tension increased
 73 dinon tak yah sthiti kaayam rahi thi
 In different ways, China put all pressure on India to retreat
 usne bharat ko yuddh tak kii dhamkee di
 Also reminded of the year 1962 defeat
 piele kii takat kii dhauns bhi di, lekin bharat bina kuch kahe ise hawa main udaata rahaa
 Ultimately, China had to negotiate a retreat with India in an embarrassing situation, but the agreement was actually a hoax, which has now come to the fore
 china kii harkaton se bharat alertchin kii harakatein dekhakar bharat ke kaan khadey ho chuke hai
 Abchina has deployed around 500 soldiers on Doklampar
 bharat ne bhi javaabi karrwai kii taiyaari shuru kar di he, lekin china kaa yah dhokhaa hamaare liye bahut bada jhatka he
 That too soon
 kyonki china ne is baat kii bhanak tak nahin lagane di he ki wo aakhir chahta kya he or kya vaaki sainik takaraav ke raste par badhanaa chahta he?kya he maamladoklam ilaake ko bhutan or china donon hi apana apana ilaaka bataate hai
 India says that Doklam belongs to Bhutan and protecting Bhutan is our responsibility
 bharat is mudde par bhutan kaa samarthan karata he or saaf kar chukaa he ki wo aise kisi bhi nirmaan ko bardaasht nahin karegaa, jisase china chikan nek tak pahunch jaae, joki doklam ke thik dakshin main sthit he
 India had launched its army against this move of China
 haalanki baari fajihat ke dhai maheene baad use apni sena peeche hataani padi thi, lekin lagata he ki beijing wo beijjati bhul gaya he
 One thing is certain on this issue that China will again have to face embarrassment
 bharat or pakistan keval ek-duusare ke padosi nahin, balki kai maamalon main swasth pratidwandvi bhi hai
 Often a strong democracy is cited in India's favor when the political situation of the two countries is compared, but in one case Pakistan is now going to leave India behind
 bharat main 2019 main aam chunaav hone hai or pakistan main 2018 main
 However, it is being said that elections in India may also be held in late 2018
 philhal donon desh is samay apane enarai voters ko matdaan ke adhikaar dene ke liye kaam kar rahe hai or is maamle main bharat apane padosi desh pakistan se pichad saktaa he
 While a 'proxy voting system' is being arranged for nris in India, state-of-the-art software is being developed in Pakistan
 'proxi voting system' hamaare yahaan nayaa nahin he
 In our country, soldiers working in the security forces can vote in two ways
 vah bailat paper kaa print lekar, apni pasand kii party yaa pratyaashee ko vot dekar apane vot dak ke jariye bhej dete hai
 Apart from this, these employees can also choose any of their relatives as their regular proxy voter
 sainik jab tak sena main rahegaa, yah proxi voter uske jariye vot detaa rahegaa
 nris are currently required to be registered as voters in India and must visit their constituency for voting
 philhal keval kerala ke hi kuch enarai matadaata hi panjikrut hai
 Now the government is going to give this right to nris, so that they can choose their relatives as proxy voters
 haalanki, enarai ko har matdaan ke liye har baar proxi voter chunanaa hoga
 The Government of India, in a hearing in the Supreme Court in November 2017 in this regard, sought 12 weeks to present the bill in Parliament
 vahiin, pakistan meniske ulat, naishanal database and registration athurity (NADRA) or pakistani chunaav ayog (ECP) milakar aisa software bana rahe hai, jisase videshon main rahane vaale pakistani bhi aam chunaavon main aasaani se vot daal sakenge
 Both organizations have said in the Supreme Court of Pakistan that efforts are being made to give easy voting rights to 80 lakh Pakistanis settled abroad
 pakistani akhbaar don kii website ke mutabik NADRA ke chairman osman mobin ne kaha he ki philhal software viksit ho rahaa he or chunaav ayog ko bhi isaki jaankaree he
 He has said that it can be used in mock elections and it will be ready for general elections in April
 is software ko taiyaar karne ke liye unhone 10 hafte kaa samay maanga he
 Through this, overseas Pakistanis will have to go to the Pakistan Embassy for voting
 pakistan ke chif justise saaqib nisaar ne kaha he ki yah pakistaniyon ke liye gift hoga
 Although there was an attempt to make such software in Pakistan earlier, but it was not implemented

 Maulana Fazlur Rahman, President of Pakistan's Parliamentary Committee on Kashmir, has condemned President Asif Ali Zardari's latest statement

 Rahman told reporters in Islamabad that Zardari is the President of us but he is an inexperienced leader
 unhone kaha ki jaradaari ko bolte samay sahi shabdon kaa chunaav karnaa chahie
 Significantly, Zardari had told the Wall Street Journal columnist Brit Stephens that Jammu and Kashmir fighters are terrorists

 purv cricketer gautam gambhir ne raajnneeti main bhi apni ahm pari kaa armbh kar diya he or unhone apni is nai pari ke liye bhartiya janata party ko chunaa he
 Gautam Gambhir has made a significant contribution to the country on the cricket field
 jahaan wo bharat kii taraf se ek safal openar rah chuke hai
 Gambhir is known for his reckless and aggressive style
 yuvaaon ko to unka ye andaaz behad pasand he
 He is seen as an honest cricketer and human being
 isi vishay main dilli ke yuvak apurv bhatnagar kaa kahana he ki gambheer ko raajnneeti main nahin aana chaiye tha, kyonki unka cricket kariyar bahut saafe or safed rahaa he, par raajnneeti ke bare main to sabko pataa he ki yahaan koi rasta sidhaa nahin jaataa
 Gambhir retired from all formats of cricket in December 2018 and Gautam Gambhir started taking interest in politics as well as giving his feedback on important issues of the country, after he said goodbye to cricket
 haalanki, gambhir ke mutabik raajnneeti main unke aane kaa ek maatr kaaran desh seva he, kyonki unka maananaa he ki unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi kii eemaandaaree or desh seva se prabhavit hokar hi bijepi kii raajnneeti ko chunaa he
 While some people are also criticizing Gambhir's decision that a cricketer should not get into politics, some people appeared to be standing in favor of Gambhir's decision
 is vishay par yuvak shailendra kaa kahana tha ki "ye acha sanket he hamen unka swaagat karnaa chaiye
 If he has done well in cricket, then he can also do well in politics
 unhen ek mauqaa milanaa chaiye, naa ki sirf isaliye aalochana karnaa ki wo ek cricketer hokar raajnneeti main aa rahen hai to acha nahin kar paayegein"
 Although the pitch of politics is considered very different from the cricket pitch
 aise main bhale hi wo ek diggaj or safal cricketer rah chuke hai, par raajnneeti kii pich par unhen kaafii chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 The bjp's top leader Arun Jaitley is being said to be the hand behind bringing Gautam Gambhir into politics, who will in a way be called his political guru and will also play the role of a coach on the political pitch, which is a must
 gautam gambhir dilli main hi paley bade hai
 It was from here that he started playing cricket
 ek tarah se wo dilli ko acchhee tarah jaanate or samajhate hai
 Therefore, the decision to contest elections from the seat of New Delhi can be justified
 kyonki dilli khaaskar yahaan ke yuvaaon se jaani jaati he or gambhir un yuvaaon kaa pratinidhitiv karte nazar aa sakate hai
 However, the party is yet to declare him a candidate
 ek yuvak harvinder singh kaa maananaa he ki "gautam gambhir ne party galat chuni he kyonki bijepi ne pichley paanch saal main koi bhi kaam nahin kiya he
 Only propagated lies "

 First Mamata Banerjee made public the names of Congress candidates after meeting Sonia Gandhi
 magar mamata ne media ko yah nahin bataaya ki trinmul kii taraf se unhone keval ek naam somnath da kaa bataaya tha
 It took 16 hours for the Congress to clarify on this, till then what speculations were made in the political corridors
 mamata or mulaayam ke teenon ummidavaaron main se sabase chaunkaane vaala naam pradhanmantri manmohan singh kaa tha
 Mamta simultaneously showed status to Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and Pranab Mukherjee
 jaahir he teenon sunn or apmaan se gusse main the
 However, Manmohan Singh's name was not surprising to those who understood the pulse of politics
 congress ko adhiktar saansad dabi jubaan main kah rahe the ki manmohan singh ko raisina hill bhejnaa chahie or pranab yaa rahul gandhi ko pradhanmantri banaaya janaa chahie
 But this could not happen
 kaha yah bhi ja rahaa he ki desh main ek badi lobby he jo pranab mukherjee ko vitt mantralay se baahar dekhnaa chaahati he
 This is the business lobby
 or yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki nae vittamantri vodaphone par sarkaar ke nirnay ko palatney vaale hai
 The Congress made it clear that Manmohan Singh will remain Prime Minister till 2014
 chalo kisi cheez main to party kii taraf se saaf baat kahi gai
 Now speculation will stop when Manmohan Singh leaves and Rahul Gandhi arrives
 ab shuru hoti he asli raajnneeti
 
 
 The day Mamta and Mulayam Singh hold a joint press conference, Sonia Gandhi and Mulayam Singh meet at 11:30 pm on the same day and they promise to support the Congress candidate
 ab sawaal yah he ki mulaayam singh chah ghanton main mamata ko di jubaan se palat kaise gaye
 Mulayam Singh, a wrestling expert, believes in politics, sometimes in chit or sometimes pat
 press club kii gocip par yadi yakeen kiya jaae tab shaayad mulaayam singh ko die cese kii file dikhaai gai
 Then someone's theory is that a large industrial house became quite active in Pranab da's favor
 jabaki usee se judaa doosraa paksh jo mulaayam ke kaaphi najadik he
 And it was from here that the pressure was on and Netaji was defeated in the washerman and in the dark of night in front of Madam, appeared from the back door
 khabar do din baad hi li ho pai
 No one knows better than the Congress to use material, punishment, distinction in politics
 ab mamata akele kalam ke naam par adi raheen
 In fact, as soon as mamta-mulayam had taken the names of Kalam, Manmohan and Somnath da, the Congress felt as if the snake had sniffed
 netaaon ke mobile band ho gaye the
 Pranab da looked sad and silent when he came out of his office that night
 ham sab main se kisi kii himmat nahin hui ki koi kuch puche
 If sources are to be believed, Pranab da had conveyed to the Congress high command that same night that if the party did not support his name, he would retire from politics as well as public life
 tab ja kar party harakat main ai
 Many fled towards 13 Talkatora Road
 pranab da ko manaaya gaya or kai mahatvapurn netaaon ke mobile on ho gaye
 There were reports that the Congress would announce Pranab da's name and all this was happening at half past two in the night
 agle din 10 baje sonia gandhi se pranab da mili phir cabinet kii baithak main pahunche jahaan raashtrapati pad ke do ummidavaar aamane-saamne the
 That is, Manmohan Singh and Pranab Mukherjee

 Except Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress allies were present
 sonia gandhi ne pranab da ke naam kii ghoshnaa kar di or pranab da ko tiaar baaluu ne shawl udha kar badhai di
 Pranab da was distributing sweets when he reached the finance ministry
 dada ke liye sugar free mithai mangai gai thi or patrakaron ke liye barfi or laddu
 There was a lot of flak for Pranab da, who was getting frequent calls in which most of the Chief Minister, Governor and grandfather were old friends of Kolkata
 kuch phone land line par aa rahe the to kuch mobile par
 Dada's mobile was with his colleague Pradyut Guha
 unhone mobile enditivi ke manoranjan bharti ko pakadaa diya us mobile main pranab da ke liye 68 missd kol or 64 anared massej the
 The entire media was left behind Pranab da's family
 unki beti sharmitha ne kaha ki unhen dukh he ki bengal kii hi ek party ne bengal ke sabase kaabil ummidavaar ko apana samarthan nahin diya
 Ishara was on Mamta's side
 dada kii patni ne kaha ki sab naseeb kaa khel he or jab pranab mukherjee apane daftar se nikle to sabko dhanyavad kaha or bahan mamata banerjee se bhi apil kii ki vah bhi apana samarthan unhen den

 The response from the Haryana government has come in the wake of the ongoing controversy over international shooter and prize money of Manu Bhaker, who won gold in shooting at the Youth Olympics
 ek ore jahaan haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ne kaha he ki manu ko inaam kii raashi jarur milegi, vahiin khel mantri anil vij ne salaah di he ki sirf khel par dhyaan do
 However, CM Khattar has also said that the method of tweeting is not right
 bataa den ki youth olympic-2018 main gold jeetne ke baad 16 saal kii manu ko rajya sarkaar ne 2 karod rupee kaa nakad puraskaar dene kaa vaada kiya tha jo is nishanebaaj ko abhi tak nahin mila he
 Please tell that Manu Bhaker has asked on Twitter whether this announcement was correct or jumla
 darasal, manu bhaakar ne beete saal qareeb teen maheene pehle bunus yris main hue youth olympic khelon main shooting main gold medal jeeta tab haryana sarkaar kii ore se unhen do karod rupee inaam kaa elaan kiya gaya
 But angry about not getting the reward after almost three months of that announcement, 16-year-old Manu asked sports minister Anil Vij and asked for the amount, then the minister was angry and he asked Manu to focus on sports
 
 khel mantri ne kaha ki manu ko pehle khel mantralay se baat kerani chahie thi naaki twit
 However, he has reiterated the promise of reward as promised
 manu ne pichley saal youth olympic ke alaava kaamanwealth games or shooting world cap main bhi gold medal jeeta tha
 Sir Please confirm if it is correct
 
 
 Or just Jumla

 chhattisgarh main shahari ilaakon kii aam janata ko sasti dar par shuddh pine kaa pani muhaiyaa ho sake, iske liye sarkaar ne raipur samet ek darjan jilon main 150 water atm lagane ko manjuuri di
 The municipality and the municipal corporations have also installed water atms in select areas
 saal bhar hota aa rahaa he lekin water atm se pani nahin nikal rahaa he
 These water atms have become a showpiece since the year
 water conection ke alaava bijli conection bhi nahin mil paaya he, kyonki nagareey prashasan vibhaag ne saaf nahin kiya ki water atm kaa bijli bill kaa bhugtan aakhir koun karegaa
 As a result all 150 water atms are just beautifying the roads
 pyaase log uske kareeb aate hai, lekin unhen nahin pataa ki bijli nahin hone se mashin thapp padi he
 Power connection not found in year, summer season in Chhattisgarh has knocked
 rahgeeron ke kanth sookhne lage he
 They stare at the water ATM in search of cold water, but they feel disheartened when it comes to know that it has not been provided electricity for a year
 aise main pyaase naagarik sarkaar ko kosne main koi kasar baaki nahin chhodte
 While the government had made good arrangements to provide pure drinking water to the people
 nagareey nikaayon ke afasaron ne pheraa paniwater atm mashin kharidne ke liye nagareey nikaayon ko acha khaasaa bajet muhaiyaa karaayaa
 But on this exercise, the administration of the urban bodies was turned away
 ise afasaron kii bhul kahen yaa laaparvaahee
 They installed water atms in various places, but neither made any arrangements nor provided any guidelines to provide electricity connection to the machines
 aise main water atm muhaiyaa karaane vaali company ne apana kaam kar diya
 He installed water atms at the appointed place and got settled after receiving his bill payment
 water atm mashinakai shahro main saal bhar se rahgeeron ko apni ore aakarshith kar rahi he
 When officers were made aware of this, then it was found out why the Water ATM machine has come to a standstill
 haalanki harakat main aae afasaron ne nagareey prashasan vibhaag ke kartadhartaaon ko is bare main chetaya
 Now the department has come into action
 nagareey prashasan vibhaag ne saaf kiya he ki water atm ke liye pani or bijli conection sambadhit nagareey nikaay arthath nagar palika or nagar nigam ke naam se liya jaae
 In addition, demand note for electricity connection will be paid through the concerned service provider
 vibhaag ne lee water atm kii sudder se hi sahi lekin ab jakarvibhaag nesahi kadam uthaaya he
 He wrote and directed the CMO of the urban bodies
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki is baar garmi main naam maatr ke shulk ke saath logo ko thanda pani muhaiyaa hoga
 You must have always seen Arvind Kejriwal and Narendra Modi as political opponents of each other
 guuruuvaar kodonon netaaon kii mulaakaat se pehlekayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki yah ek 'aupchaarik or thandi' baithak ho sakati he
 But contrary to estimates, this meeting was good
 15-17 minute kii yah mulaakaat kisi rahi, kisne kya kaha, ham aapako bataate hai
 As the clock struck 9:30 on Thursday morning, Delhi's future Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal came down from his fourth floor flat in Kaushambi and left in an Innova car
 raste main unhone manish sisodiya ko liya or phir donon netaa 7 rescorse ke liye ravaanaa ho gaye
 On the way, the two discussed the issues he was about to raise before the Prime Minister
 vah 10:20 par pradhanmantri awaas pahunch gaye
 There he was seated in the waiting room
 thodi der baad donon meeting room main daakhil hue
 The Prime Minister was waiting for him here
 unhone donon kaa swaagat kiya
 Shaking hands with Kejriwal, Modi said, 'come, Arvind ji
 
 
 kaise ho manish? bahut bahut badhiya
 You have got a great mandate
 acha kaam kijiega
 Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia smiled politely in response
 pradhanmantri ne donon ko 'buke' dekar swaagat kiya, jawaab main donon ne PM ko shukriya kaha
 By then tea had arrived and Kejriwal invited the Prime Minister to attend his swearing-in ceremony
 is par pradaanmantri ne kaha ki vah jarur aate lekin 14 farvari ko unka kaarykram pehle se tay he, isliye vah nahin aa paaenge
 Now there were serious discussions
 kejariwal ne dilli ko purna rajya ke darje kaa mudda uthaaya
 Further Sisodia put the matter like this, 'we both got an absolute majority
 shahar kai bhaagon main banta hua he
 People's life is divided
 ye ek sunaharaa mauka he
 We request you to consider the status of full state
 centre sarkaar ko rashtriya-antarrashtriya maamle sanbhaalane hote hai or ham dilli sambhaal sakate hai
 "the Prime Minister patiently spoke to him and smilingly said," There is nothing permanent in democracy
 ham is par vichaar karenge
 Kejriwal asked the Prime Minister how was his experience running the government so far
 is par modi ne kaha, 'hamaari bhi apni majaburiyaan hai
 Many bills are not able to pass in Rajya Sabha
 ' jawaab main sisodiya bole, 'sar ummid he aapako rajyasabha main bhi bahumat mil hi jayega
 Yes, if it is late, it will be able to be done after four years, then there are many big things that will not be done in time
 ' kejariwal ne kaha, 'aapke sahyog kii jarurat hogi
 Modi said, "cooperation will continue, good luck
" 'iske baad phir unhone haath milaae
 Kejriwal and Manish come out of the room
 pradhanmantri dobaaraa apni kursi par baith gaye
 Probably for another meeting

 dhaulavira se lagbhag 360 kilometre dur is sthaan par 250 se zyada kabren hai jo lagbhag 5 hajaar saal puraani hai

 kuccha main kii gai khudaai ke dauraan mila kabrakachh ke lakhapat taluka ke khaatia gaanv main yah khudaai kuccha uniwarsity or kerala uniwarsity ne milakar kii he

 Excavations have also found bracelets made of mussels, stone mills and stone blades
 kabron main mitti ke bartan bhi mili hai
 In a tomb, a maximum of 19 and at least 3 utensils were kept near the dead body
 puratatvavidon kaa kahana he ki aise bartan pakistan ke amari, naal or kot se bhi baraamad hue hai
 In northern Gujarat in India, these tombs have been found from Nagawada, Chhatrad Saheli, Moti Peepali and Surkotada and Dhaneti in Kutch
 puratatvvid ve rajesh kahana he, 'khudaai main mili mitti ke bartanon, pattharon ke dher or duusari chizon ke bhuraceinic pareekshan se hamen pataa chalegaa ki inhen us samay ke logon ne kis takanic se banaaya, inhen banane main koun se kachche maal kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 After investigation in all laboratories, we will get to know the history of the inhabitants of the early Harappan era living near Khatia
 ' Leader of Opposition in Delhi Legislative Assembly Vijendra Gupta has made serious allegations against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on making DTC bus travel free for women of Delhi
 unhone kaha ki dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal apni raajnneetik mahatvakankshaon ko puraa karne ke liye dilli ke bhavishya ko darkinar kar rahe hai
 He is bent on ruining Delhi only by making ludicrous promises and at the same time giving a deep injury to the self-respect of Delhiites
 gupta ne kaha ki ek taraf to desh ke lokapriy pradhanmantri narendra modi ji desh ko 5 trillian dollar kii arthvyavastha banane kaa vaada kar tarakkee ke nae aayam rachane ko prerit kar rahe hai or duusari taraf desh kii rajdhani dilli ke mukhyamantri vikaas karne ke bajaay tex ke paise ko free kii yojanaayen main baantkar vikaas ko roak rahe hai
 Gupta said that CM Kejriwal d for women
 tii
 Has announced free service in c buses but CM should also know that when he came to power in Delhi 4 and a half years ago, then D
 tii
 5000 buses of c were running on the streets of Delhi but now only 3800 buses are left
 unka kahana he ki in 3800 bason kii bhi haalat bahut khasta he
 In such a situation, Kejriwal ji is first
 tii
 Increase the number of b buses so that they have connectivity at all places
 jab tak sabhi sthanon tak bason kii pahunch hi nahin hogi to free safar karne kaa koi laabh mil paayegaa
 He further said, 'these promises are being made for the benefit of Kejriwal's election
 aise samay main arvind kejariwal jitani chaahe free kii ghoshnaaen kar len, parantu ab to dilli kii janata kejariwal sarkaar ko dilli se ukhaad phenkane kaa mood bana chuki he
 In this election, the people of Delhi will surely punish the Kejriwal government for stopping the development of Delhi for the last four and a half years

 Today, India is living on a kind of fatalism, which stems from the harsh reality that emerged after the attack on Mumbai that if it can happen to Mumbai then every city can easily become its victim
 nai dilli or mumbai agar aatankwaadiyon ke liye mahatv-purna nishane hai, to isaki vajah in do mahanagaron kaa kramshah bharat kaa satta pratishthan or vittiya sampannataa kaa pratik hona he
 India needs to demonstrate that it is capable of protecting these two cities, or that it will send a message to some people — at least all its enemies — that it has the will to protect its democracy
 in do mahanagaron kii suraksha kii chunautiyaan inaki bhugolic sthiti or janasankhyikee kii vajah se adhik gahan ho gai hai
 Both cities are far-flung and are under tremendous population pressure
 aise main unki suraksha kaa bhaar aise police bal par he, jo na sirf sankhya main kam he, balki jisamen kisi prakaar kii prerana kaa bhi abhaav he
 The police force's nexus with the political establishment is also widely seen as a factor in increasing corruption, which affects the effectiveness of the force as well as its image in the general public
 baharhaal, yathasthiti ko sweekaarte rahane kaa ab koi vikalp nahin rah gaya he
 Our metros should become such forts that people like the terrorists who attacked on 26 November cannot be easily pierced
 in abhedya kilon kaa nirmaan maanviya buddhi or samanvay se kiya janaa chahie, jinaki madad ke liye shreshthatam hathiyaar, chaukasee kii takanic or jaanch-padtaal ke upkaran maujuud hon
 It is possible to find clues of terror, to revoke it and to retaliate against it only when this work is specially classified and kept separate from other police departments
 shahar str par sashastr police se gathit aise ladaaku bal kii jarurat he jisamen bhaleebhanti prashikshit jawan hon or jise sirf aatankwaad se loha lene ke liye hi rakhaa jaae
 It is estimated that it will take at least six months to form a team of 100 people
 mahanagar police kii jaanch-padtaal karne vaali mashinari ko saamaanya kanoon evam vyavastha banaae rakhane vaale dhaanche se alag karne kii jarurat he
 Establishment of a centralized command center and special command chain is very important in a terrorist attack
 in niyantran kakshon ko khufia soochna prabandhan tantra se las hona chahie
 The 26 / 11 attacks also highlighted flaws caused by the lack of integration of intelligence
 police ko iskar vibhaag, utpaada shulk or khufia vibhaagon ke saath bhi adhik samanvay sthapit karnaa chahie
 Relations have already been established in organized crime, money laundering and terrorism
 in maamalon main sirf 'apane daayre' kii suraksha karne kaa matlab apane rashtriya kartavya se munh modana he
 Priority should be identified on the 50 most vulnerable locations in the city which can easily become an attack
 inamen adhiktar sthanon kii nigaraanee ke liye tatkaal sisitivi lagaae jaaen
 There needs to be a clear and speedy dialogue chain between the police and local security agencies engaged in protecting other more sensitive targets
 takanic lagu karne se adhik mahatvapurn he buniyadi police vyavastha ko durust karnaa
 It will have to restart the network of whistleblowers
 is vyavastha se kabhi mumbai police kii pahchaan bani thi
 Remaining flaws will also be removed by strengthening the Mohalla committees in Mumbai (which were weakened by a former Joint Commissioner of Police) and activating the Public Welfare Committees in Delhi in terms of their own safety
 2007 main jari 25 bade shaharon kaa vishwa surveykshan bataata he ki 59 pratishat se adhik pratibhaagiyon ne niztaa kii suraksha kii bajaae saarvajanik chaukasee ko adhik mahatv diya
 The Indian people would probably agree with this majority opinion, even if it had to introduce a system to implement the National Security Identity Card
 ek anya krantikari samaadhaan he jo rajyon ke grih vibhaagon or police bal ke bich pehle se dhundhlae rishton ko or dhundhala degaa, lekin is daleel kii pushti karegaa ki vishesh kism ke dar ko vishesh pratikriya se hi nibata ja saktaa he

 Soman suggests that it would be better to appoint a Home Secretary from the IPS category instead of IAS as he has enough experience of armed encounter
 ye sabhi saamaanya buddhi ke upaay hai, par tabhi kargar ho sakate hai jab unhen lagu karne main samay kii pabandi kaa kadai se paalan kiya jaae
 Just in November 2008, senior officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs were asked to expedite the Mahanagar Suraksha Yojana of 2005-06
 iske mahaj teen hafte baad 10 aatankwaadiyon ne bharat ke sarvaadhik samrudh shahar ko 60 ghante tak maut ke shikanje main jakade rakhaa
 So, all the reasons for the delay in strengthening the security system of our metros, whether they are valid or not, are no longer a justification
 kaary yojanagathit karnatiohar str par aisa bal, jisamen sashastr police ke prashikshit jawan hon or jise hameshaa muthbhed ke liye hi taiyaar rakhaa jaae
 Identifying the most sensitive locations of the city and enhancing their security
 sthapit karnaek kendrikrut niyantran kaksh jo sandehaaspad gatividhiyon par najar rakhe
 Strengthening mechanism of the Birds, who keep pace with intelligence department and tax departments
 visheshgyon kii raimahanagaron kii chaukasee main vruddhi karne ko lekar purv police adhikariyon ke vichaardy
