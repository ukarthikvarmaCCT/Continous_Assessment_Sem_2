 The "box" was actually a large jar given to Pandora), which contained all the evils of the world
 jab pandora ne jaar ko kholaa, jaar main nihit sabhi saamagree mukt ho gayi, lekin ek-ummid ke liye
 Today, opening Pandora's box means creating evils, which can never be destroyed
 pandora dharti par pehali mahila thi
 Pandora was created at the behest of Zeus, the god of craftsmanship, who ordered Hephaestus to create Pandora
 hefstas ne pani or dharti kaa upyog karte hue use banaaya, jabaki anya bhagavaanon ne use kai uphaar die 
 When Prometheus stole the fire from Mount Olympus, Zeus avenges it by handing over Prometheus' brother, Epimetheus, to Pandora
 isi samay, pandora ko ek jaar diya gaya or use aadesh diya gaya ki vah kisi bhi paristhiti main ise naa khole
is chetavanee ke baavjood, jigyaasa main pandora ne jaar ko khol diya
 In doing so, the evils inherent in it came into the world
 dari hui pandora ne turant jaar ko band kar diya, taaki vah zeeus kii ichha ke anusaar ummid ko usamen band kar de
 In other versions, hope does not come out, although the main purpose of Pandora's myth is to explain why evil exists in the world

 Many interpretations of this story ignore the fact that Pandora's box contains all the bad things that will make humanity sick and hope was also inside the box, thus missing the second chapter of the myth

 It was used for the storage of wine, oil, grain, or other material, or, as a religiously burying human body

 Pithos was mistranslated by Erasmus of the 16th century humanitarian Rotterdam who translated Pandora's Hesiod story into Latin
 irasmus ne pithos shabd ko latin ke piksis se joda; jiskaa arth he "box"
 The phrase "box of Pandora" has endured ever since

 british sangrahalay An early set of myths, after Jan Alan Herrison, Pandora was the manifestation of a great goddess, and Hesiod's story can be seen as part of the campaigning campaign that maintained her revered status
 hesiod ke myth kii katha devi ke ek aadmi main roopantaran ke rup main prakat hota he jo ek nashwar mahila main maanavtaa ke liye sabhi acchhee chijen detaa he, is mahila ko ek sajaa ke rup main banaaya gaya he, jo maanavtaa main sabhi buraaiyon ko shaamil karti he
 Modern feminist literary criticism also focuses on the gender symbolism inherent in myth

 This jar that brings evils to this earth suggests that topocentric culture is hostile to friendly female sexuality

 Tantra is a diversified and rich spiritual practice of the Indian subcontinent
 tantra ke antargat vividh prakaar ke vichaar evam kriyalap aa jate hai
 Tanyate vistarayate jnanam anen iti tantram - that is, knowledge is expanded through it, this is the system
 iskaa itihaas bahut purana he
 Over time, this pattern has gone through many changes and is currently a combination of extremely conservative thoughts to very advanced ideas
 tantra apane vibhinn roopon main bharat, nepal, china, japan, tibet, korea, cambodia, myanmar, indonesia or mongolia main vidyaman rahaa he
 Indian Tantra literature is vast and vivid literature
 yah pracheen bhi he tathaa vyapak bhi
 It is greater than Vedic poetry in any part
 charanavyuh naamak granth se vaidic sahitya kaa kinchit parichay miltaa he, parantu tantra sahitya kii tulana main uplabdh vaidic sahitya ek prakaar se saadhaaran maaloom padataa he
 The ancient form of Tantric literature has disappeared
 parantu uske vistaar kaa jo parichay miltaa he usase anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki pracheen kaal main vaidic sahitya se bhi isaki vishalata adhik thi or vaichitrya bhi
 In short, it can be said that the subtle analysis and description of the supreme Advaita science is not in the scriptures, as it is in the Tantra texts
 saath hi saath yah bhi sach he ki ucchatan, vaseekaran prabhruti kshudra vidyaon kaa prayog vishyak vivaran bhi tantra main miltaa he
 Apparently the present Hindu society, despite being Vedas-dependent, is controlled exclusively by Tantra in the practice-land
 'tantra' tathaa 'aagam' donon samanarthak shabd hai
 In some places, the use of the word 'nigam' also appears in place of the word Agam
 phir bhi yah sach he ki tantra samajhane ke liye aagam shabd kaa 'shabdpraman' rup main arthath aaptvachan rup main vyavhaar karte the
 In English, what is called revival, these proceeds are usually the same
 loukik aptpurushon se alokik aptpurushon kaa mahatv adhik he, isamen andeh nahin
 Just as Vedas are synthesized with Hiranyagarbha or Brahma, similarly Tantra is basically synthesized with Shiva and Shakti
 jaise shiv ke, vaise hi shakti ke bhinn rup hai
 Tantras of different departures emerged from different forms
 isi prakaar shaiva tathaa shakt tantra ke anuroop vaishnav tantra bhi he
 'pancharatra', or 'satvat', is the name of this agam
 vaishnnav ke sadrush ganpati or saura aadi sampradaayon main bhi apni dhara ke anusaar aagam kaa prasar he
 Dr
 Shredder had published an excellent essay about Pancharatra Agam in the role of 'ahirbudhnya Samhita', which shows that Vaishnav Agam also has a very large literature
 parantu yahan vaishnav tantra ke vishay main kuch vistrut aalochana na kar shaiva or shakt aagmon kii aalochana hi prastut he
 Although Tantra cannot be called a homogeneous convention, but in Tantric literature - mul tantra sahitya saamanyat: teen bhaagon main vibhakt ho saktaa he- See ancient Tantra literature for details
 vistrut vivaran ke liye madhyamik tantra-sahitya dekhen
 For a detailed description, see the specific teacher of Tactics

 CSIS claimed that the wiretaps did not contain any relevant information, but a memo from RCMP states that "it is very likely that CSIS would have retained the tapes between March and August 1985, at least in both bombings
" Successful prosecution of the main culprits could have taken place
 " On June 4, 1985, CSIS agents Larry Lowe and Lynn mcadams followed Talwinder Singh Parmar and Inderjit Singh Rayat to Vancouver Island

 The title of this novel is taken from a translation of the poem "kabul" composed by the 17th century Iranian poet Saib Tabrizi: Oh, the beautiful city of Kabul wears a rugged mountain skirt,and the rose is jealous of its lash-like thorns
the dust of Kabul's blowing soil smarts lightly in my eyes,but i love her, for knowledge and love both come from her dust
 i sing bright praises to her colorful tulips, the beauty of her trees makes me blush
 How sparkling the water flows from pul-i-mastaan! May Allah protect such beauty from the evil eye of man! Khizr chose Kabul to paradise,for her mountains brought him near to heaven's delights
the fort's dragon-sprawling walls guard the city well,each brick is more precious than the treasure of Shayagan
 Every street in Kabul fascinates the eye
in the bazaars, Egypt's caravans pass by
no one can count the beauteous moons on her rooftops, 'and hundreds of lovely suns hide behind her walls
' Her morning's laugh is as gay as flowers, Her dark nights shine like beautiful hair
 Her tuneful nightingales sing with flame in their notes, Fiery songs like burning leaves, fall from their throats
 i sing to the gardens, Jahanara and sharbara
even the tuba of Paradise is jealous of their greenery
 "every street of Kabul is enthralling to the eyethrough the bazaars, caravans of Egypt passone could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofsand the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls" saanchaa:acha lekh Shogun This was a state title given to the general secretary or general of the Emperor of Japan from 1192 to 1867

 Japanese history of this period is divided into the periods of these Shogun dynasties
 aupchaarik rup se japan kaa shaasha japan kaa samraat hota tha lekin vah keval naam kaa shaasha tha kyonki rajasi shaktiyaan puri tarah shogun ke niyantran main thi
 When the Portuguese became the first European power to come in contact with the Japanese in 1543, they gave details that the Shogun's chieftains were also full of kings and ruled freely
 samraat ko keval dharmik drushti se japan kaa pramukh hone kaa aadar praapt tha
 The Shogun was so powerful that if an emperor did not listen to him, he could even force him to step down

 Kumbhipake Vasetsopi Yavadindrashasturdash॥ 24॥ Devi bhagavatapuranam aapekshikta siddhantvishisht aapekshikta kaa parichay Specific relativity theory or specific theory of relativity Albert Einstein, in his paper on electrostatics in moving objects, gave a physical theory of measurement in the inertial directive system proposed in 1905
 galileo gallily ne abhigruhit kiya tha ki sabhi samaan gatiyaan saapekshik hai or yahan kuch bhi nirpeksh nahin he tathaa kuch bhi viraam avasthaa main bhi nahin he, jise ab galileo kaa aapekshikta siddhant kaha jaataa he
 Einstein extended this theory, according to which the velocity of light is absolute and fixed, a phenomenon that was recently visible in michelson-morley's experiment
 unhone ek abhigruhit yah bhi diya ki yah sabhi bhautik niyam, yantriki va sthiravaidyutiki ke sabhi niyamon, wo jo bhi hon, samaan rahete hai
 There are a large number of results of this theory that have been observed experimentally, such as time dilation, length contraction, and symmetry
 is siddhant ne nishchar samay interval jaisi avadharana ko badalakar nishchar dik-kaal interval jaisi nai avadharana ko janm diya he
 This theory gave the revolutionary mass-energy relation e = mc2, where c is the velocity of light in vacuum, this formula is a joint derivative of other physical laws, including the two postulates of this theory
 aapekshikta siddhant kii bhavishyavaaniyan newtoneey bhautikee ke parinaam ko sahaj hi ullekith karte hai, visheshtah jab prekshaniy vastu kaa veg, prakaash ke veg kii tulana main naganya ho
 According to specific relativity theory, the velocity of light c is not merely the velocity of a hypothesis, such as the velocity of electromagnetic radiation, but is a fundamental characteristic of the integration of macromolecules and time as a period of time
 is siddhant kaa ek parinaam yah bhi he ki aisi koi bhi vastu athwa kan jiskaa viraam dravyaman shunya nahin he kisi bhi paristhiti main prakaash ke veg tak twarit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The reason for calling this theory specific is that this principle applies only to inertial reference systems
 iske kuch varshon pashchaat saamaanya aapekshikta naamak vyapak siddhant diya gaya, jo vyapak nirdeshaankon par kaary karata he or isse gurutvkarshan samajhane main bhi sahaayta milti he
 —albert Einstein: Autobiographical Comments ainstin ne do moolbhoot prastaav die jo sabase adhik sahi prathit hote hai, jo tatkaaleen yantriki or vidyutgatiki ke niyamon kii paripurna vaidhata kii andekhi karke die gayi
 This motion depended on the velocity of light and was independent of the physical rules and inertial reference system
 unhone 1905 main apni pratham prastuti main in abhigrihiton kaa ullekh kiya The derivation of specific relativism depends not only on the above two identities but also on the various implicit hypotheses including the isotropy and symmetry of the macro, freedom of rod measurement and clocks from the history of our past
 vishisht aapekshikta par 1905 main ainstin kii mul prastuti ke anusaar, vibhinn parivarti vyutpan vidhiyon dwaara praapt vibhinn abhigruhit die ja chuke hai
 According to the specific relativity principle, no directional system is absolute
 prithvi par sthir nirdesh tantra jadtviya nirdesh tantra nahin he kyonki yah prithvi kii ghurnan gati ke saath yah bhi ghurnan karata he
 The inertial motion mechanism is also inertial at a fixed velocity relative to an inertial direction system
 atah nirpeksh jadtviya nirdesh tantra kii pariklpana niraadhaar he
 Suppose the directive system s has the time coordinates and the directive system s ′ has coordinates
 tab lorenj roopantaran ke anusaar in nirdeshaankon ko nimna sambandhon dwaara gyaat kiya ja saktaa he : Where lorenj gunak he or c nirvaat main prakaash kaa veg he or nirdesh tantra S′ kaa veg v x-aksh ke samaantar he
 The y and z coordinates are not affected; Only the x and t coordinates move
 yahan x-aksh main kuch vishesh nahin he, sthaanantaran y athwa z akshon par bhi lagu ho saktaa he, athwa kisi bhi disha main jo disha gati kii disha ke samaantar or lambavat ho
 a zodiac sign that remains undervalued in Lorenz transformation is called Lorenz Neischer
 bhinn nirdeshaankon main lorenj roopantaran or iske vyutkram likhane par, jahaan ek ek ghatana ke nirdeshaank or hai tathaa duusari ghatana ke nirdeshaank or tab unke antaraal nimna tarah se paribhaashit kiye jate hai : So we can write vishisht aapekshikta ke parinaam lorenj samikarnon se vyutpann kiye ja sakate hai
 These transformations and specific relativities also give different results from the notable results when the relative velocity values are equal to the velocity of light
 prakaash kaa veg maanav nirmit kisi bhi samagam se bahut adhik he jo vishisht aapekshikta dwaara kuch prabhaav praapt kiye gayi
 Examples such as symmetry, time dilation, length contraction have been proved experimentally
 do bhinn ghatnaayen jo ek jadtviya nirdesh tantra main samakshanik hai, ho saktaa he duusare jadtviya nirdesh tantra main sthit prekshak ke liye samakshanik nahin hai 
 First equation of Lorenz transformation in different coordinates yahan yah spasht he ki jo ek nirdesh tantra s main samakshanik hai, aavashyak nahin kii anya nirdesh tantra S′ main bhi samakshanik hon 
 If these events are isotropic in the directive system S, then they will be congruent in the other directive system s ′
 ek prekshak se duusare prekshak tak kinhin do ghatanon ke madhya samay nishchar nahin he, balki prekshkon kii gati par nirbhar karata he Suppose a clock instruction is at rest in mechanism S
 is ghadi ke do bhinn tik-tik ko Δx = 0 dwaara pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 The time between these two ticks is measured in both systems, for this the first equation is given as follows: isse pradarshit hota he ki do tik ke madhya kaa samyaantar nirdesh tantra jisamen ghadi viraam avasthaa main thi kii tulana main nirdesh tantra jisamen ghadi gatisheel thi main adhik tha
 With the help of time extension, we can understand many physical hypotheses such as the rate of loss of muons generated by the cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere
 ek prekshak dwaara kisi vastu kii vimaa kaa maapan anya prekshak dwaara prekshit maapan se bhinn ho sakati he
 Similarly, in the considered linear pause, the instruction system s is aligned towards the x-axis
 is tantra main rekhak kii lambaai Δx likhi jaati he
 The measurement of the length of the line in the s 'reference system in which the clock is moving where x ′ is measured at the ends of the rod is paralleled in the S' mechanism
 anya shabdon main, is maapan ko Δt′ = 0 main kiya gaya, jise chaturth sameekaran dwaara yugmit kiya ja saktaa he ke liye lambaaiyon Δx or Δx′ main nimna samband sthapit kiya jaataa he: This indicates that the length of the rod in the instruction system in which the rod was moving is lower than its own stop instruction mechanism
 vegon ke sayonjan ke liye inhen saadhaaran rup se nahin joda jaataa
 If according to the observer in the instruction mechanism S, an object is moving with velocity u towards the x axis, then the motion object observed by the observer located in the direction mechanism s ′ which is moving along the x-axis and v velocity relative to the instruction mechanism s The velocity u 'is where: anya nirdesh tantra main prekshit : It is worth noting here that objects which are moving with the velocity of light in the instruction system S, then that object will also be moving with the velocity of light in the direction system s ′
 yadi u or v ke maan prakaash ke veg ke saapeksh bahut nune hai to hamen vegon ke sahaj galilia roopantaran praapt hote hai The common example that is given is that a train is moving eastward and v velocity relative to the tracks
 ek baccha jo train ke andar baitha he ne ek gend purv disha kii or train ke saapeksh veg u se phenkaa
 In orthodox physics, the velocity of the ball of the observer placed at rest on the tracks will observe u = u ′ + v in the east direction, while the specific relativity is not true; Rather, the velocity of the ball is given in the east direction by the second equation: u = / 
 punah, yahan x athwa purv disha ke liye kuch vishesh nahin he
 These formulas will apply in any direction for which we have to take care of the mutually parallel and vertical motions of relative velocity v
 ainstin kaa vegon ke sangyojan kaa niyam phizaau prayog main sahi paaya gaya, jisane prakaash ke veg kaa maapan prakaash ke veg ke samaantar gatisheel taral ke saapeksh kiya tha
 But till date no experiment has tested the formula for a broad form of unequal motion
 thomas agragaman ko thomas ghurnan ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, yah kanon ke prachakran par lagu hone vaala aapekshik shodhan he
 The orientation of an object may be different for different observers
 anya aapekshik prabhaavon ke vipareet, yah prabhaav ati nimna vegon par bhi sarthak he, jaisaa gatisheel kanon ke prachakran main dekha ja saktaa he
 As the speed of an object approaches the velocity of light in the observer's perspective, its relative mass also increases, making it more difficult to accelerate, all of which appears to be from the observer's directive system
 viraam avasthaa main kisi vastu kii urja kaa maan mc2 hota he jahaan m vastu kaa dravyaman he
 By the law of energy conservation, in any action, the decrease in mass should be equal to the increase in its kinetic energy after the action
 isi prakaar, kisi vastu kaa dravyaman ko isaki gatij urja ko isamen lekar badhaaya ja saktaa he
 In addition, Einstein also wrote at least four papers, making self-empirical arguments for equivalence - referring to the above-derived Lorenz transformations and explaining specific relativities
 dravyaman-urja samatulyata vishisht aapekshikta kaa ek parinaam he
 In renewable mechanics, where energy and momentum are different physical quantities, they form a quadrature direction in specific relativity and relate the time component to the macro component
 viraam avasthaa main sthit ek vastu, urja dravyaman chatursadish hota he : iskaa samay ghatak urja he or anya teen samshti ghatak hai jo shunya hai
 The energy-momentum quadrature will change when the direction mechanism changes with the Lorenz transform with a low velocity v in the x-axis direction
 saveg kaa maan urja va veg ke gunanfal ko c2 se vibhajit karne par praapt maan ke saamaan hoga
 For example, the new mass of an object, which is proportional to the momentum and velocity for low velocities, will be equal to e / c2
 urja va samveg, dravya va vikiran kaa naij gundharm he or yah parinaam nikalnaa asambhav he ki vishisht aapekshikta ke do moolbhoot abhigrihiton se ve apane aap chatursadish rup main praapt honge, kyonki ye padaarth athwa vikiran ke vishay main nahin bataate, balki samshti va samay ke bare main bataate hai
 Therefore, its derivative requires more physical knowledge
 iske liye ainstin ne atirikt siddhant kaa upyog kiya jiske anusaar nimna vegon par newtoneey yantriki se sahi parinaam milte hai, atah nimna vegon par keval urja adish va teen-samveg sadish hote hai
 He further hypothesized that the energy and frequency of the light would be transformed by the same Doppler displacement component, which he had already proved true by the Maxwell equations, the subject of the first paper published in 1905 by Einstein, "whether the inertia of a body depends on that energy Does? "was
 yadhyapi paper main ainstin kaa tark bhautik vigyaniyon dwaara satya ke rup main bina kisi pramaan ke lagbhag saarvbhaumikta se sweekaar kiya jaataa he or bahut lekhakon ne pichley kuch varshon tak sujhavit kiya ki yah galat he
 According to other authors, this statement was quite inconclusive as it was based on some underlying assumptions
 ainstin ne sweekaar kiya ki vishisht aapekshikta par unke 1907 ke aalekh main uski vyutpati par vivaad hue
 There he realized that it is problematic to rely on the Maxwell equations for approximate energy-mass reasoning
 unke 1905 main prakashit paper main tark tha ki dravyaman rahit kan kaa utsarjan kiya ja saktaa he, lekin maxwell samikarnon ke anusaar ise nisandeh pratyeksh banaaya ki keval kaary ke parinamswaroop prakaash kaa utsarjan praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 For the emission of electromagnetic waves, the movement of a charged particle is sufficient and it is definitely work, hence it is the emission of energy
 chunki prakaash ke veg se tej gati sambhav nahin he, jiskaa nishkarsh nikaala ja saktaa he ki maanav prithvi se 40 prakaash varshon se adhik dur yatra nahin kar saktaa yadi yatri 20 se 60 varsh kii aayu main sakriya rahe
 It can also be easily thought that the traveler may be able to reach only a few solar systems that are located 20–40 light years from Earth
 lekin yah ek galat parinaam he
 Because the hypothetical spacecraft can travel hundreds of light years during the active 40 years of a pilot according to the hypothesis of time-span
 yadi ek aisa antarikshayan bananaa sambhav ho paaya jiskaa twaran 1g ho, to ek varsh se bhi kam samay main prithvi se lagbhag prakaash ke veg ke saamaan veg se gatisheel prekshit hoga
 Due to the expansion of time, his life extension will increase with the instruction system located on the earth, but the clock traveling with him will not change
 uski yatra ke dauraan, prithvi par sthit vyakti yatri kii tulana main adhik samay anubhav karegaa
 The 5 year excursion journey observed by the traveler will be equivalent to 61⁄2 years of Earth and 6 light years will decide
 ek 20 varsh kii bhraman yaatr ke pashchaat yadi prithvi par waapas aata he to vah prithvi ke 335 varsh vyateet kar chukaa he or 331 prakashavarsh duuri tay kar chukaa he
 a 40-year journey with 1 g acceleration would be equivalent to 58,000 years of Earth and cover 55,000 light years
 1
1 twaran ke saath 40 varsh kii yatra prithvi ke 148,000 varshon ke tulya hogi or 140,000 prakashavarsh duuri tay hogi
 For this expansion reason, a muon that is moving at almost the same velocity as the light c is c × pause is observed far beyond the half-age distance
 chitra 2 main antaraal AB 'samay-samroop' he; jaise yahan nirdesh tantra he jisamen a or b do ghatnaayen samshti main ek hi bindu par ghatit hoti hai keval alag samay par ghatit hone par hi alag kii ja sakati hai
 If event a occurs before event b in this reference system, then event a will occur before event b in all reference systems
 yah dravya ke liye sambhav he ki vah ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par gati kare, atah yahan ek kaarantv sambandh sthapit ho jaataa he
 The gap AC in the picture is macro-homogeneous, meaning that here an instruction mechanism is such that events a and c occur at the same time, only the macro is different
 yahan par aise nirdesh tantra bhi praapt kar sakate hai jinamein A, c se pehle ghatit hoti he or nidesh tantra jinamein C, a se pehle ghatit hoti he
 If it were possible for a cause-and-effect relationship that certain events would occur between a and C, then the paradox of causality would be the result
 udahaaran ke liye, yadi a kaaran tha or c prabhaav he to kuch nirdesh tantra aise bhi hai jinamein prabhaav kaaran se pehle ghatit hua
 Although this is not contradictory in itself, it can be demonstrated that the speed of light can transmit itself to the ghost of its own instruction system at a faster rate
 kaaranta virodhabhash kaa signal bhejkar nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he yadi or keval yadi purv main koi signal nahin mila tha
 Therefore, if the causality is preserved, then no information or matter can move faster than the velocity of light as a result of specific relativity
 tathaapi, kuch vasteen prakaash ke veg se bhi teji se gati karti hai jaise : sthaan jahaan bijli kii chamak ke kaaran kirane badal ke nichle hisse se takaraati he to us samay yah kiran prakaash ke veg se bhi adhik gati se duuri tay kar sakati he jab yah shighrata se mudati he
 Without taking into account the causality, there are many more powerful reasons here
 The speed of light is prohibited by specific relativity
 udhaaharan ke liye ek niyat bal aseemit samay ke liye ek vastu par lagu kiya jaye to nimna vyanjak kaa bina seemaa ke samakalan karne par f = dp / dt saralata se samveg praapt kiya jaataa he lekin yah keval isliye kyonki p = m γ v { \ displaystyle p=m \ gamma v \ ,} anant kii or agrasar hota he jaise-jaise v { \ displaystyle \ ,v}, c kii agrasar hota he
 For an observer who is not quick, this is exemplified although the inertia of the object increases, so a small acceleration is produced under the influence of the same force
 yah vyavhaar vastav main kan twarakon main prekshit hote hai, jahaan prayek aaweshit kan vidyutchumbakeey bal dwaara twarit hota he
 Theoretical and experimental surangan studies propounded by Günter Nimtz and Petrissa Eckley incorrectly claimed that under special circumstances the signal could move at a speed greater than the velocity of light
 yah maapan kiya gaya kii fibre ankikaran signal c se 5 guna veg tak gati karata he or shunya samay surangan electron dwaara le jane vaali soochna ki parmaanu kaa photone se ynikaran or iske baavjood bhi electron surangan main shunya samay lagaataa he
 According to Nimtz and Eckley, this over-illumination process violates only Einstein causality and specific relativity but not primitive causality: hyper-fluorescent communication is not the result of any kind of time travel
 vibhinn vaigyanikon ke anusaar na keval nimtz kii vyakhyaayein galat hai balki prayog vastav main vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa saamaanya praayogic satyaapan he
 The 4-dimensional Minkowski macro is used in specific relativities; - This is an example of a time period
 minkovesaki dik-kaal maanak trivim eucalidia samshti ke bahut samaan prathit hoti he, lekin samay ke saath isamen kranthik parivartan aa jaataa he
 The differential line in the three-dimensional space is defined as ds jahaan dx = trivim samshti main avakal alpaansh hai
 In Minkowski's geometry, the derivative coordinate x0 over time is over-dimension, so the distance differential is jahaan dx = chaturvim dik-kaal main avakal alpaansh he
 This suggests a deeper theoretical insight: the special relativity is comparable to the normal rotational symmetry over a period of time, corresponding to the rotational symmetry in the Euclidean complex
 eucalidian samshti kii tarah eucalidian doorik kaa bhi upyog hota he atah dik-kaal minkovesaki doorik ko upyog karata he
 Originally specific relativity is seen as the "dormancy of the downtime" when it is seen in "some inertial instruction system"
 vishisht aapekshikta kii sabhi samikarnon va prabhaavon ko minkosaki dik-kaal kii ghurnan samamiti se vyutpan kiya ja saktaa he
 The actual form of the above "ds" depends on the distance and the choice of x0 coordinates
 samay nirdeshaank ko samshti nirdeshaank ke sadrush banane ke liye, ise kaalpanik kii tarah upyog kiya jaataa he : x0 = ict 
 According to Missner, Thorne, and Wheeler, a deeper understanding of both specific and general relativities is ultimately derived from Minkowski's distance study and that the impermeable Euclidean distance time coordinates take x0 = ct instead of ict
 kuch lekhak x0 = t kaa upyog karte hai jahaan c ke gunak ko anyatra samahit kar lete hai; udahaaran ke liye, samshti nirdeshaankon ko c se vibhajit kiya jaataa he athwa c±2 ke gunak ko doorik pradeesh main prayukt karte hai
 Here various practices can be replaced by the Prakrit unit where c = 1
 isamen samay va samshti donon kii ikaiyaan samatuly hoti hai or koi c kaa gunak bhi kahin bhi prakat nahin hota
 If we reduce the corresponding dimension to one, so that we can represent physics in stereoscopic tab dwait shanku ki disha main shunya parivartan milegaa, sameekaran ke rup main or jo c dt trigya vaale vrut kaa sameekaran he
 When we increase it in three squares, this amount is exemplified in the quadrilateral cone: atah This null duality-cone represents a point in the macro as one-dimensional
 yah jab ham taron kaa adhyayan karte hai or kehete hai ki "is taare se aaptit prakaash jo main ab dekh rahaa hoon vah amuk varsh purana he", ham is bindu ko vimaa ke rup main dekhte hai : ek ashakt geodesic he
 We call this event the distance d = x 1 2 + x 2 2 + x 3 2 { \ displaystyle d = { \ sqrt {x_ {1} ^ {2} + x_ {2} ^ {2} + x_ {3} ^ The d / c at {2 xxrep 4 } occurred before time
 is kaaran se ashakt dwait shanku ko 'prakaash shanku' ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 In the cone - "t" field means receiving information from the point and sending the point information to the + "t" area of the cone
 minkosaki samshti kii jyamiti minkosaki arekhon ke upyog se chitrit kar sakate hai, jo vishisht aapekshikta main vibhinn praayogic vichaaron ko samajhane main upyogi bhi hai
 Equations of specific relativity can be written in express variable form
 kisi ghatana kii dik-kaal main sthiti pratiparivarti chatursadish dwaara di jaati he jiske ghatak nimna hai : We define x0 = ct so that the dimensions of the time coordinates are the same as the distance, as are the other dimensions; Hence, time and time are equally related, the vertices are used for the reflex index, not for their power and the footprints are variable indices that range from zero to three, such that the quadrature of the scalar region लिखा is written: jadtviya nirdesh tantron main nirdeshaank roopantaran lorenj roopantaran λ dwaara die jate hai
 For a particular state of motion when it is in the direction of the x-axis: jo x va ct nirdeshaankon ke madhya abhivardhan matrix he, jahaan μ' panktiyon ko tathaa ν sthambh kaa suchak he or It can be interpolated for velocity in any direction and can also include forward rotation, see the topic of Lorenz transformation for more information
 ek jadtviya nirdesh tantra se duusare main chatursadish kaa roopantaran lorenj roopantaran dwaara die jate hai: Here μ 'and ν' are added from 0 to 3
 vyutkram roopantaran nimna hai : Where λ μ ′ ν { \ displaystyle \ Lambda _ { \ mu '} {} ^ { \ nu}}, व्युत् μ ′ ν { \ displaystyle \ Lambda ^ { \ mu'} {} _ { \ nu}} This is called a matrix
 lorenj roopantaran kii sthiti main uparokt x-aksh kii disha main liya gaya he : More broadly, most physical quantities are defined as components of the display
 atah ek nirdesh tantra se duusare main roopantaran, vyapak pradeesh roopantaran niyamon kaa paalan kar saken Here λ χ ′ ψ { \ displaystyle \ Lambda _ { \ chi '} {} ^ { \ psi} \ ,}, λ χ ′ ψ { \ displaystyle \ Lambda ^ { \ chi'} {} _ { \ psi}} Is the inverse matrix of

 The components of the Minkowski Durik η of the quadratic nature of the time period can be written as a matrix of 4 × 4: jo un nirdesh tantron main apane vyutkram η α β { \ displaystyle \ eta ^{ \ alpha \ beta }} ke saamaan he
 The Poincare Group is a very broad group of converts that comprise Minkowski's distance
 or yah vishisht aapekshikta kii aadharbhoot bhautik samamiti he
 a small change in length in the quadratic position is written as the square of dx μ { \ displaystyle dx ^ { \ mu} \ !} yah ek nishchar raashi he
 By inertia means its value is the same in all inertial reference systems because it is a scalar sign, so no λ appears in its normal transformation
 jab rekhaansh dx2 kaa maan rinatmak hota he Then standard time is derivative, while dx2 is positive, standard is derivative of distance
 prasish rup main bhautik samikarnon kaa praathmik maan piyonkare samooh main nishchar rahata he, atah yah prabhaav kalit karne ke liye hamen vishisht va kathin gananaaen nahin kerani padati
 Other physical quantities known as pradisha also follow the transformation rules
 chaturveg sadish Uμ nimna sameekaran dwaara diya jaataa he We then consider the combination of velocities in a simple sentence related to the conversion of the quadrilaterals from one directive system to another
 Uμ kaa bhi ek nishchar rup hota he : Therefore, the scale of all Chaturveg vector is c
 yah sameekaran yah sabit karti he ki aapekshikta main sthaayee nirdesh tantra kii pariklpana ko asaty siddh karti he : kyonki ham kam se kam samay main hameshaa agragami hai
 The quadrature vector is given by the following equation: iske pashchaat uparokt sameekaran ko τ ke saapeksh avaklit karne par Therefore, in relative, the acceleration quadrant and velocity quadrature are perpendicular angular
 samveg va urja ko covariant 4-sadish main sammilit kiya jaataa he : Where m is the mass of mass
 chatursamveg sadish kaa nishchar maan samveg-urja sambandh vyutpan karata he : What is this conclusion we can prove for which we have to prove that it is a scalar, it does not depend on which instruction system we are calculating and the conversion of the instruction system gives us the total momentum minus is
 yahan yah spasht he ki sthaayee dravyaman swatantra va nishchar he
 Static mass is also calculated for moving particles and bodies, for which they are converted into a directive system in which they have zero momentum
 sthir urja kaa sambandh dravyaman se he or yah chirparichit sambandh sameekaran upar ullekith kii gai : Keep in mind that the mass of the body is divided into their mass center reference system, which is given by its total energy in this direction system
 yah anya nirdesh tantra main maapan kiye gayi nijee nikaay dravyamanon ke yoga ke samaan ho aavashyak nahin
 In order to use Newton's third law of motion, both forces must be defined as the rate of change of velocity in the same time direction mechanism
 jahaan, upar paribhaashit trivim balon kaa hona aavashyak he
 Unfortunately, the quadrature does not contain any field that incorporates the components of the stereoscopic force vector into its components
 yadi kan kaa veg c nahin he tab kan ke sahagaami nirdesh tantra se prekshak nirdesh tantra main trivim balon kaa roopantaran sambhav he
 This creates a 4-vector called Chaturbal

 Similarly, by moving charge, the derivative magnetic field disappears in the concomitant directional system and changes only to the electrostatic force
 atah maxwell samikarane brahmand ke chirsmmat pratimaan main vishisht aapekshik prabhaav saralata va anubhavik rup se uchit hai
 As the electric and magnetic fields are dependent on the directional system and are contained in each other, so they are also called electromagnetic forces
 vishisht aapekshikta ke madhyam se ham ek jadtviya nirdesh tantra se duusare jadtviya nirdesh tantra main inke roopantaran niyam praapt hote hai
 The Maxwell equations in stereoscopic form are analogous to the physical properties of specific relativities, although they are implicitly implicitly implied in the corresponding concomitant form
 adhik jaankaree ke liye mukhya sutara dekhen
 The specific relativity in its Minkoski period is only in the case when the absolute value of the gravitational potential is much less than c2 in the field of study
 In the strong gravitational field, the general relativity should be used
 saamaanya aapekshikta durbal kshetra kii seemaa main vishisht aapekshikta ke tulya ho jaati he
 At extreme scales such as the Planck length and even lower, quantum effects must be subjected to quantum gravity

 some examples are: vishisht aapekshikta ko kwantum yantriki ke saath milakar aapekshik kwantum yantriki kaa vikaas kiya ja saktaa he
 It is included in the list of unsolved riddles in physics, how to integrate general relativity and quantum mechanics; Quantum gravity and the theory of universality, which requires integration and is an active and currently progressive subject of theoretical research
 purv bor model dwaara us samay ke kwantum yantriki gyaan va vishisht aapekshikta ke upyog se kshar dhaatu parmaanuon kii uttam sanrachana kii vyakhya kii gai
 In 1928, Paul Dirac introduced the effective relativistic wave equation, similar to what is today known as the Dirac equation, which is compatible with both specific relativity and the last quantum theory dating back to 1926
 yah sameekaran na keval electranon naij koniya samveg jise prachakran kehete he ki vyakhya karti he balki isane electron ke prati-kan ke asthitv kii bhavishyavaanee bhi kii
 And the best structure flourished only with specific relativity
 yah aapekshik kwantum yantriki kaa pratham aadhash tha
 In general quantum mechanics, spinning is a new phenomenon and cannot be explained
 anya udhaaharan ke taur par dekhen to, prati-kanon kii khoj se siddh hota he ki in ghatnaon ko aapekshik kwantum yantriki samajhane main sakasham nahin he or yah kanon kii anyonya kriya ke liye ek purna siddhant nahin he
 Rather it is essentially the theory of particles which are related to quantized regions, hence it is called quantum field theory; In which particles can be decimated and erased over time
 panzia, panjeya yaa panji, ek vishaal ekikrut mahadweep tha jiskaa astitv lagbhag 250 million varsh pehle peliojoik or mizozoik yug ke dauraan tha; maujuuda mahadweep apane vartmaan swaroop main isi main se nikal kar aaye hai
 The name was coined in the scientific discussion of Alfred Wegener's theory of continental flow
 apni pustak "da origin of continents and oshans" main unhone mana tha ki sabhi mahadweep baad main vikhandit hone or pravaahit hokar apane vartmaan sthanon par pahunchne se pehle ek samay main ek vishaal mahadweep kaa hissaa the jise unhone "uracontinent" kaha tha
 The term Pangea came to light in 1928 during a symposium held to discuss Alfred Wegener's theory
 ek vishaal mahaasaagar jo panzia ko chaaron ore se ghere hue tha, tadnusaar uskaa naam panthalasa rakhaa gaya
 It seems that the fragmentation and origin of the vast continents is consecutive in the history of the Earth's 4
6 billion years
 panzia se pehle kai anya nirmaan bhi hue ho sakate hai
 Last to second, Panotia was formed 600 million years ago during the Proterozoic Eoin and existed until 540 ma
 panotia se pehle rodenia astitv main tha jo lagbhag 1
1 billian varshon pehle se lekar 750 million varshon pehle tak maujuud rahaa tha
 Rhodinia was formed by the deposition and joining of fragments resulting from the fragmentation of an old massive continent called Columbia or Nuna, built in the period 2
0–1
8 GA
 rodenia ke sateek vinyas or jeeyodynamiks itihaas ko utani behatar tareeke se nahin samajha gaya he jitna panotia or panzia ko
jab rodenia kaa vikhandan hua to yah teen tukdon main bant gaya: proto-loresia kaa vishaal mahadweep, proto-gondvanaa kaa vishaal mahadweep or apekshaakrit chota congou creton
 proto-loresia or proto-gondvanaland ko proto-tethis mahaasaagar ne alag-alag kar diya tha
 Laurentia, Siberia and the Baltic continents were formed soon after proto-laurentia itself split and separated
 isaki daraar se do nae mahasaagaron, ipitas mahaasaagar or pelioasian mahaasaagar kaa bhi nirmaan hua
 The Baltic was located east of Laurentia and north-east of Siberia Laurentia
 600 eme ke aasapaas in mahasaagaron main se zyaadaatar ne waapas ek saath milakar ek apekshaakrit alpaayu vishaal mahadweep panotia kaa nirmaan kiya jisamen dhruvon ke paas badi maatra main jameen or bumadhya rekha ke paas dhruviya mahasaagaron ko jodne vaali sirf ek apekshaakrit choti pattee shaamil thi
 Only 6040 years after its origin, about 540 ma, near the beginning of the Cambrian era Panotia disintegrated, giving rise to the southern continent of Laurentia, the Baltic, and Gondwana
 cambrian kaal main laurenshia kaa swatantra mahadweep, jo uttari america bana, yah teen ore se ghire simaankit mahasaagaron ke saath bumadhya rekha par sthit ho gaya: uttar or pashchim main panthalasik mahaasaagar, dakshin main ipitas mahaasaagar or purv main khantee mahaasaagar
 pracheenatam ordovisian main 480 eme ke aasapaas evalonia kaa chota mahadweep, ek jameen kaa hissaa jo purvottar sanyukt rajya america, nova scotia or england bana, gondvanaa se mukt ho gaya or isane laurenshia kii ore apana safar shuru kar diya
 The Baltic, Laurentia, and Avalonia all united together by the end of the Ordovician period, thus forming a small continent near the Iapetus Ocean called Euramerica or Laurecia
 takkar ke parinaam swaroop uttari epalachiyans kii bhi utpatti hui
 siberia do mahadwipon ke bich khantee mahaasaagar ke saath uramerica ke nikat sthit ho gaya
 When all these incidents were happening, Gondwana slowly slipped towards the South Pole
 yah panzia kii utpatti kaa pehla charan tha
 The second phase of Pangea's genesis was Euramerica's collision with Gondwana
 By the Silurian period, 440 MA, the Baltic had already collided with Laurentia to form Euramerica
 evalonia abhi tak laurenshia se nahin takaraayaa tha or unke bich ek samudri maarg, ipitas mahaasaagar kaa ek avshesh abhi tak sikud rahaa tha kyonki evalonia dhire-dhire laurenshia kii ore khisakane laga tha
