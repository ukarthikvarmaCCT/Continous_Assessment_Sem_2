 The design of Hayabusa is aerodynamically very sensitive

 Hayabusa's heavy bargain is due to its large 1340cc engine

 The Government of India approved the campaign on 18 September 2008 in a meeting of the Union Cabinet held under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 antariksh yaan ke dizin ko agast 2009 main purna kar liya gaya jisame donon deshon ke vaigyanikon ne apana sanyukt yogadan diya
 However ISRO finalized the payload as per Chandrayaan-2 program
 parantu abhiyaan ko janvari 2013 main sthagit kar diya gaya
 And rescheduled the campaign for 2016
 kyonki rus lander ko samay par viksit karne main asamarth tha
 Roskosmos was later dropped from the Chandrayaan-2 program due to a failure in the phobos-grunt expedition to Mars
 tathaa bharat ne chandra mishan ko swatantra rup se viksit karne kaa faisla kiya

 The lander will not perform any scientific activities
 lander tathaa rover kaa vajan lagbhag 1250 kilo hoga
 Initially, the lander was expected to be developed by Russia in cooperation with India
 jab rus ne 2015 se pehle lander ke vikaas main apni asamarthta jataai
 So the Indian authorities decided to develop the lander independently
 rus lander ko radd karne kaa matlab tha
 That the mission profile will change
 swadeshi lander kii praarambhik concigareshan kaa adhyayan 2013 main antariksh anuprayog centre,ahmedabad dwaara puraa ki gayi
 The research team identified the landing method for landing on the lunar surface

 The initial plan was to have the rover designed in Russia and manufactured in India
 haalanki, rus ne may 2010 ko rover ko dizin karne se manaa kar diya
 Subsequently, ISRO decided to design and manufacture the rover itself
 iaiti kanpur ne gatishiltaa pradaan karne ke liye rover ke teen up pranaaliyon viksit kii: ISRO has announced that as per the decision of an expert committee, five payloads will be sent to the orbiter and two to the rover

 The Maharaja of this dynasty is addressed with the title of 'mahendra'
 yah oopaadhi aaj bhi is kul ke mukhiya ke naam rahati he
 According to a manuscript, Bhadauria of Agra in 1650 is mentioned as follows: - wo ek asankhya udhyami or vir yoddha hai, unke har gaanv main kila or kilabandi thi, wo bina yudhya ke kabhi bhi jagirdaar yaa haakim ko lagaan nahin dete the, riyaaya jo hal chalati thi, unke kandhe par bandook latakati thi or anti main abharak bandhaa hota tha | unhe lagaan maafee ke rup main haakim se barood miltaa tha | Bhadoria is divided into four categories, this division started with four sons of Raja Rajju Raut in the 1200 century which took place from their four marriages
 The men of Kunwar Bamdeo are known as Raut Bhadauria 2
 The menus of Kunwar Mansingh are known as the f of menu Bhadoria 3
 The men of Kunwar tas-singh are known as Tasela Bhadoria 4
 Raja Udai Raj became king till 1400 century, his dynasty continued without division, Kunwar Bhav Singh, the brother of Raja Jait Singh, who established Jaitpur in 1427, in 1440 failed the invasion of the Nawab of Kalpi and killed the Nawab of Kalpi and took away his ax
 h taken, since this incident, Kunj Bhav Singh's Vansaj Kulhia is known as Bhadoria

 Upon receiving King Raut Sal's Veergati in this nursery, his queens entered the palace, a queen who was pregnant, according to the tradition, the pregnant was not allowed by the Zohar, so the queen was taken from the fort of Hathikath by a Mirdha caste
 The Jat man who was the message bearer of King Raut Shaal, brought his way to the river, across the Jamuna, through the drain of the fort
 Bhadauria had not forgotten this aid of Mirdha till today

 In 1259, when he was 12 years old and presented in the Delhi court of the then Emperor Nasir-ud-din, Emperor Nasir-ud-din was upset with the Meo Lutero of this area, this 12-year-old Bhadoria boy 'rajju Raut' Mewati Mavo, who had escaped from the court after he was thrown out of Agra's Pinhat, was captured by Mevo, who was captured by Raju Raut and attacked Hathikath in 1246 with Hatiameo Baig, the Mewati chief

 After the death of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707, King Kalyan Singh Bhadauria of Bhadavar captured Dholpur in the battle fought and remained part of the princely state of Dholpur Bhadavar until 1761

 The Marathas and Jato took over a large part of their kingdom in 1748
 Shortly after, the Bhadoria king took possession of the territory and offered friendship to the Maratha court of Gwalior, but the help of his friend Gondha's Rana against Marotho
 Due to doing this, he had to face the anger of Scindia and it was in a state of misery till the Maratha war of 1803
 saundaryashastra samvednaatmak-bhaavnaatmak gun-dharm or mulyon kaa adhyayan he
 Aesthetics is the representation of art, culture and nature
 saundaryashastra, darshanashastra kaa ek ang he
 It is also called Soundaryamimansa and Anandamimansa
 soundaryashastra vah shaastra he jisamen kalatmak kritiyon, rachanaaon aadi se abhivyakt hone vaala athwa unamem nihit rahane vaale saundarya kaa tathvik, darshanik or maarmik vivechan hota he
 The main purpose of this is to discuss the nature and nature of the joyful feeling in our mind by looking at a beautiful object and to coordinate it with other sensations of life
 saundaryashastra darshan kii ek shakha he jiske tahat kala, sahitya or sundarata se sambandhit prashnon kaa vivechan kiya jaataa he
 There is a word in the Greek language 'esthetico' which implies the derivation of 'esthetics', for the sense that is received by sense perception apart from the realm of knowledge
 prakruti, kala or sahitya se sambandhit clasical saundaryashastreey drushtikon viksit hua
 This approach keeps the political and contextual dimensions of the work out of the scope of the work, keeping its concern only with the beauty and art form
 lekin kala or sahitya vivechna kii kuch aisi vidhiyaan bhi hai jo kritiyon ke taatpary or unki rachana-prakriya ke saamaajik or aitihaasik pahaluon se samvaad sthapit karti hai
 Marxist aesthetics is one such discourse
 pracheen unani darshan main plato kii rachana hippiaz major main saundarya kii avadharana par charchaa milti he
 Aristotle's thoughts on the sad style of play in his poetics have influenced art-criticism for a long time
 kala or saundarya par hue gair-pashchimi pracheen chintan ke sandarbh main bharat ke naatyashaastra, abhinavgupt ke ras-siddhant or chini vidwaan cheng yin-yuvan kii rachana lee-tai ming-hua chi dwaara prastut anuthe or vistrut vimarshon kaa loha pashchimi jagat main bhi mana jaataa he
 non-western standards for interpreting this tradition of art-practice have not yet been formed, and interpretations made through Western standards have yielded unsatisfactory results
 pashchimi vichaar-jagat main ek darshanik gatividhi ke taur par saundaryashastra kii pruthak sankalpana attharahavin sadi main ubhari jab kala-kritiyon kaa anushilan hast-shilp se alag karke kiya jane laga
 This resulted in the formulation of the concept of fine arts by theorists
 alexander gottaleeb bomgaarten ne 1750 main esthetica likh kar ek bahes kaa sutarapaat kiya
 Seven years later, the emerging discourse of aesthetics was questioned by David Hume writing 'of the Standard of Tests'
 lekin aadhunik europee saundaryashastreey vimarsh kii vaastavik shuruyaat emanuel kaant kii 1790 main prakashit rachana 'critic of jajment' se hui
 In this work, Kant insisted on universalizing the criterion of aesthetics
 lekin duusari ore ve kisi bhi tarah ke saarvbhaum saundaryashastra kii sambhaavna par andeh karte hue bhi nazar aaye
 Despite this contradiction, Kant's achievement was that he established some essential dialects to explore art and beauty
 in dvibhajanon main sarvaadhik ullekhneey hai : indriyabodh or tark-buddhi, sarawastu or rup, abhivyakti or abhivyakt, anand or upsanhaar, swatantraaa or aavashyaktaa aadi
 Kant's second achievement was that he distinguished between aesthetic experience and aesthetic experience
 unka kahana tha ki saundaryashastreey vyakhya or uski nishpatti vishleshan ke lakshya ke prati bina kisi vyaavhaarik aasakti ke hi kii jaani chahie
 The nineteenth century can be said to be a century of aesthetics
 kaant kii banaayi gayi zamin par hi baad main german vidwaanon ne saundaryashastra kaa vrihattar darshanik dhaanchaa khadaa kiya
 Hegel in his works Lectures on Esthetics, Schopenhaur in The World as Will and Representation and Nietzsche in Fine Births of Tragedy gave various interpretations of various aspects of Western aesthetics and published new dimensions
 unnisvin sadi ke aakiri daur main angrezi bhashi saundaryashastra main rupvaad kaa ubhaar hua
 Victorian Britain gave the slogan 'for the art of art', among whose spokespersons Oscar Wilde's name is notable
 vishuddh saundaryashastreey anubhav par bal dene vaale rupavaadi drushtikon ne lagbhag sabhi kshetron main aadhunik kala-roopon ko gaharaai se prabhavit kiya
 But the sounds of opposition to this movement were made by the great Russian litterateur Leo Tolstoy, What is Art? And narrated the work of John Dewey, the leading spokesman for American consequentialism, in Art as Experience
 tolstoy kaa tark tha ki jo kala manushyon ke bich naitik anubhutiyon kaa sampreshan nahin kar sakati, vah rupavaadi kasautiyon ke hisaab se kitni bhi mahaan kyon na ho, uski saraahna nahin kii ja sakati
 Divi also protested against art being cut from the structures of experience outside the realm of aesthetics in the name of aesthetics, taking ironics from the question of the role of communication
 saundaryashastreey chintan kii german parampara beesvin sadi main bhi jari rahi
 Aesthetic theories were further enriched using tools of phenomenology, hermeneutics and Marxism
 1936 main martin haidagar ne ‘da orijan of da work of art’ jaisaa niabandh likhaa jise kala ke darshan kii sarvshereshth rachanaaon main se ek mana jaataa he
 Heidegger claimed in this essay that viewing art work as an object in this world is one of the fundamental semiotic errors of modernity
 hidagar ke mutabik kala to ek naye jagat ke dwaar kholti he, kala ke rup main satya apane-aap main ghatata hi nahin hamaare apane anubhav ke daayre main vastuon ke astitv kaa udghaatan bhi karata he
 In this way, through aesthetics, Heidegger criticized modernity and took on traditional existential epistemology and technological interpretation of things
 beesvin sadi ke madhya tak saundaryashastra kii upyogita par sawaal uthne lage
 In some of his lectures given at the beginning of the century, Edward Bulow had asked the question whether the definitions of art and beauty were eroding the creation-ability of the artist
 ye vyaakhyaan 1957 main chape or saath ke dashak main america kalakaar barnet newman ne elaan kar diya ki saundaryashastra kaa upyog kala ke liye vahi he jo pakshishastra kaa pakshiyon ke liye hai
 That is, an artist ignorant of aesthetics is good
 samskruti-adhyayan ke tahat saundaryashastra ke abhijanonmukh rujhaanon kii kadi pariksha kii gayi he
 Pierre Bordeaux not only identified the ideological underpinnings of art under the sociology of culture, but also stated that aesthetics has not been able to establish its own cultural and political roots
 bordiyo ke is vichaar kaa pratwaad adorno kii rachana esthetic thiyari main miltaa he
 Adorno cites the example of twentieth-century non-standard art, saying that art still has the potential to counter ideology
 adorno ke mutabik kala apane samaaj kii upaj zarur hoti he, par uskaa rachana- prakriya main saamaajik niyatatvavaad se swytt kshan bhi nihit hota he
 Therefore, it also gives the artist and his audience or reader an opportunity to think in ways other than those used by the then dominant culture
 kuch marxvaadi vidwaanon ne saundaryashastra kii ek marxvaadi shrenee viksit karne kii koshish bhi kii he
 In view of such efforts from a critical point of view, the leading Marxist literary critic Namwar Singh of Hindi has considered the first example of this as the creation of 'socialist Realism' in the Soviet Union
 unhone kaha he, ‘shaastra banate hi saamaajik yatharth bhi sutarabaddh ho gaya or us yatharth ko abhivyakt karne kii style bhi
 a new formalism got under way, both in composition and in criticism
 jis desh ne samaajawaadee kranti kii, vah sahitya or kala ke kshetra main koi kranti karne se thithak gaya
 Such an insult to reality was not even in the literature before the revolution, and not even in the literature of the nineteenth century Europe when the Bourgeois Revolution gave rise to realism
 haalat bahut kuch hindi kii ritivaadee kahi janevaali sahitya-pravriti kii- si ho gayi, jab alankarishastra ke lakshan granthon ko saamne rakh kar kavitaayen likhi ja rahi thim
 ' namvar singh ne doosraa udhaaharan jorge lukach dwaara rachit saundaryashastra naamak vishaal granth kaa diya he
 He describes it as a monumental attempt by Lukach to finally compile his nearly sixty years of long literature into an orderly scripture, 'this huge text of thousands of pages is still available in the German language and which the Germans would know well, He will be able to say something confident about it
 angrezi main abhi tak uske bare main jo kuch kaha gaya he or uske chhitput anshon se jo abhas mila he uske aadhaar par itnaa to kaha hi ja saktaa he ki isamen samast kalaon ko ‘anukaran’ main nisshesh karne kii asafal cheshtaa kii gayi he
 In this way, when the Marxist Lukach goes on tying all the arts into one scripture, he is ultimately forced to go to Aristotle
 kisi angrezi saptahik ne is granth kii samiksha ke saath ek aisa cartoon chapa tha, jisamen lukach marks kii dadhi ke saath arestu kii shakl- surat or poshaak main pesh aate hai
 Namvar Singh believes that Lukach's parable reveals a weak aspect of this long tradition of Marxist aesthetics
 ve kehete hai ki ‘aksar vah swayan ‘kala’ naamak sanstha ko chunauti dene main chook gaya or kala kii clasiki paribhaasha ko sweekaar kar lene main use koi haani nahin dikhaai padi
 Once these definitions are accepted in the basic form, then with some manipulation, the work of evaluating this poet or work remains; And needless to say that Marxist aesthetics have demonstrated their talent in this field - competing with the biggest thinkers of high culture
 vyakhya or moolyankan kii bhashaa nishchay hi bhautikwaadi bhi he or aitihaasik bhi, lekin kul milakar vah prabhutvshaalee parampara se bahut alag nahin he

 But its influence and some of its elements can be seen in many dance and theatrical styles of the state, including the classical theater of Kerala in Kathakali
 jin nrity shaileyon main kalaripayattu ke tatv dekhe jate hai, ve hai kolkali, welkali tathaa yatrakali
 It is very interesting that born in the royal family of India, "rajpat-leaving" to become a Buddhist-monk, "bodhidharma" took this Kalaripayattu art to China in the fifth century
 is kala ko sikhaane ke liye unhone shavolin mandir chunaa
 In chronology, Kalaripayattu gave birth to martial arts like judo, karate and kung-fu
 china ke log ise zyada sikhte hai or "aatmaraksha" ke liye is vidha ko apanaate hai
 lekin isse yah to sabit nahin hota he ki kungphu china kii hi khoj ho
 saint-bodhidharma is said to be the father of "kung-fu"
 There are many temples built in Shaolin, China after him
 So it has been speculated that Saint Bodhidharma went to China during the 6th century
 China did not exist at that time, the saints had gone to give knowledge of Buddhism to the people living on the other side of the Himalayan Mountains of Hindkush

 Kung fu is the oldest form of martial arts in which fighting is to be done without any weapon
 Like this, it is an art of fighting without fighting
 "kung-phu bhartiya-buddha-sant-bodhidharma" kii shikshaaon par aadhaarit he jo ki paanchavin-chhathin sadi main china main chale gaye the

 But it is certain that wherever Bodhidharma went, he took a unique form of martial art with him
 As you can see Kaliripayattu in Kerala right now
 Bodhidharma stayed in the new temple in Sholin and dedicated his life to this art along with other Buddhist saints

 Dr
 Ramanika Gupta, expressing her opinion about the tribals, writes, "it is true that tribal literature was deprived of alphabets, so he could not record his imagination and reality in writing nor in history

 It is a matter of great excitement that the tribals who waged a struggle to save Bharatbhumi from the clutches of the British, started the campaign to expel the same oppressed tribes from their water, forest and land only in the name of development

 Ramanika Gupta draws a similar picture in the story of the "tragedy" and says "the workers, all backward, Dalit, Adivasi big caste people used to walk around with their sticks and collect their terror, but never did hard work or wages

 The Constitution of India does not define tribal or scheduled tribe society separately but under Article-366 of the Constitution, "scheduled" refers to those communities which are scheduled in Article-342 of the Constitution

 The norms followed for specialization in the Scheduled Tribes of a community are the presence of primitive traits, distinct culture, geographical Bilgaon, hesitancy in contact with the larger community and backwardness

 But a caste itself is divided into several sub-castes and groups
 is vibhaajan kaa aadhaar bahudhaa ek hi peshey ke andar vishesheekaran ke bhed prabhed hote hai
 But geographical shifting has also given the opportunity to co-exist with multiple castes doing the same traditional occupation

 arthath jati vah he jo akruti ke dwaara pahachaani jaae, sab lingon ke saath na badal jaae or ek baar ke batalo se hi jaan lee jaae
 It is clear from these definitions and phraseology that the word 'caste' was not used for various human beings in ancient times

 The concept of Ghuriya is that in each language region there are about two hundred castes, which, if divided into endogamous groups, this number rises to about 3,000

 According to S
 Dhuriye, in terms of caste there are six characteristics of Hindu society - jaateey samoohon dwaara samaaj kaa khandon main vibhaajan, Often a certain sequence of elevation among ethnic groups, khanpan or saamaajik vyavhaar sambandhi pratibandh Disqualifications and privileges of various groups regarding civil life and religion, peshey ke chunaav main purna swatantraaa kaa abhaav or Rules for marrying within your caste
 paramparaagat rup main jatiyaan swytt saamaajik ikaiyaan hai jinke apane aachaar tathaa niyam hai or jo anivaaryat: brihattar samaaj kii acharsanhita ke adheen nahin hai
 In this form, morality and social life of all castes is neither mutually monogamous nor fully integrated
 phir bhi, bhartiya jatiparak samaaj kaa samanvit tathaa sugathit saamudayik jivan he, jisamen vividhtaon tathaa vibhinnataaon ko saamaajik manyata praapt he
 The Kshatriyas, except the Brahmins and some Vaishya castes, often punish them for violating the routine and ethics of each caste
 kshatriya tathaa brahman jatiyaan bhi jaateey janamat ke dabaav se or yadakada jaateey bandhuon kii tadarth panchayat dwaara ulanghankartaaon ko anushaasit or dandit karti hai
 This discipline of upper castes has also been done by the state machinery
 jatiyaan ek duusare kii tulana main unchi yaa nichi hai
 On one side there are Brahmin castes considered to be religiously sacred after Kshatriya and on the other side there are castes called ‘unholy’ and ‘untouchables’ of Antyaja category
 inke bich anya sabhi jatiyaan hai jo saamaajik maryaada kii drushti se ucch, madhyam or nimna shrenee main rakhi ja sakati hai
 Hindu theology has divided the entire society into Brahma, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra in these four varnas
 jatiyon kii saamaajik maryaada kaa anumaan karne main isse suvidha hoti he
 But the chromatic status of many castes is uncertain
 kysth jati ke varna ke vishay main anek dharanaayen hai
 With whom food can be eaten sitting in a row and whose food or water is touched or made by hand, it is acceptable or unacceptable, there are many ethnic rules which are different in different castes and regions
 is drushti se brahman ko centre main rakhkar uttar bharat main jatiyon ko paanch samoohon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he
 There are Brahmin castes in a group in which one caste by itself does not accept raw food of another caste and cannot sit and eat food in a row
 brahmanon ko kuch jatiyaan itani nimna maani jaati hai ki uchjaatiy brahmanon se unki kabhi kabhi saamaajik duuri bahut kuch utani hi hoti he
 The higher is between a Brahmin caste and a Shudra caste
 duusare samooh main ve jatiyaan aati hai jinke haath kaa pakaa bhojan brahman sweekaar kar saktaa he
 From the castes of the third group, a Brahmin can only receive water
 chauthe samooh kii jatiyaan yadhyapi achhut nahin, tathaapi brahman unke haath kaa jal grahan nahin kar saktaa
 In the fifth group, all those castes are Brahmin and other pure castes, just by touching them, the Brahmin and other pure castes are impure and to remove impurities, washing clothes and body and other purifications are required
 hindu samaaj main bhojan sambandhi ek jaateey aachaar yah he ki kaccha bhojan apni jati ke haath kaa hi sweekaarya hota he
 The second tradition is that raw food is also consumed in the hands of a Brahmin
 teesri parampara yah he ki apane se sabhi unchi jatiyon ke haath kaa kaccha bhojan sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 All castes are in the first tradition and other castes generally follow the later rules
 ek achhut jati duusari achhut jati ke haath se na to kaccha or na pakkaa bhojan sweekaar karti he, yadhyapi shuddh jatiyon ke haath kaa donon prakaar kaa bhojan unhen sweekaarya he
 There is no distinction between raw and cooked food in eastern and southern Bengal, Gujarat and all over southern India

 Russell has told about Madhya Bharat that there are 40 different castes of farmers, 11 of weavers and seven of fishes
 krishi, vyapaar or sainik vritti aadi kuch aise peshey hai jo praaia: sabhi jatiyon ke liye khule rahe hai
 Untouchables are exceptions to this, though agriculture also performs many untouchable castes
 aaj isa kii 20 veen shatabdi ke madhya tak adhikansh jatiyon ke adhiktar log apane paramparaagat peshon main lage hai
 Making leather, making shoes, cleaning the vista etc

 In contrast, the weaving business has been adopted by many small castes
 jajmaani vyavastha se sambandhit nai, dhobi, badhai, lohaar, aadi ke kuch aise dhandhe hai jinpar sambandhit jatiyaan apana adhikaar maanati hai
 Paurohitya has a monopoly of Brahmin castes

 In fact, often even in a caste, there are many endogamous groups which are in a way castes themselves and have different ethnic panchayats, discipline and practices

 There are some exceptions to homogeneous or intermarriage

 In Malabar, the Namboodri Brahmin has a matrimonial relationship with the matriarchal Nair woman

 Due to its origin and time there are many opinions about the period, which are all based on conjecture

 The second strong view is that the rise of caste took place before the arrival of the Aryans in the non-aryan society and the arrival of the Aryas contributed to that
 is mat ke samarthakon kaa kahana he kiya', 'jeevatatvvaad' 'abhinishedh' or jaadu aadi kii bhaawanaaon se prabhavit vibhinn samooh jab ek duusare ke sampark main aae to ve apane vishwaas, samskruti, prajapati, dharmik karmkand aadi ke kaaran ek duusare se pruthak bane rahe
 Because many ethnic groups believed that food and commercial equipment have detrimental effects

 Incidentally, caste also found the basis of karmism
 vyavsaay, kshetreeyata, varnasankarya aadi anek tatwon ne use prabhavit, parivartit or drudh kiya
 The arrival of Aryo gave this new look and caste system also entered Aryo
 vaidic sahitya ke aadhaar par yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki prarambh main bhartiya aaryo main teen varg the jo samast sansar ke aaryo kii visheshta thi or jo jatiyon se mulat: bhinn the The caste origin is in varnas according to Hindu scriptures
 rugveda ke 10 wein mandal ke purushasukt ke anusaar brahma ke mukh se brahman, bhujaaon se rajanya, janghaon se vaisya or pairon se shudra utpann hue
 Thus, the origin of four varnas has been assumed since the beginning of human creation
 manu aadi smritikaron ne prayek varna ke vyakti ke saamaajik or vyaktigat kaary, jeevika, shiksha diksha, sanskaar or kartavya tathaa adhikaar sambandhi niyamon kaa vidhaan kiya he
 In the Varna system, the priest and teacher class are Brahmins, the ruler and the military class are Rajajanis or Kshatriyas, the productive class Vaishyas and the artisans and the servants are Shudravarnas
 anek vidwaanon kaa mat he ki vaidic arya samaaj main teen aspasht varg the
 In fact, at that time, Gauravarna Arya and Shyamvarna Das were the only two characters who on one hand separated the skin and black color apart, and on the other, the official distinction and cultural differences between the conqueror and the conquered
 dasavarna baad main shudravarna hua or iske saath aaryo ke teenon virgo ne milakar chaaturvarnya kii sristi kii
 The tribes which remained away from the Arya Samaj were not included in the varna system

 Only inverse marriages were prohibited

 The origin of caste discrimination was not in the Aryans
 at: jati shaastrakaron dwaara aapekshit rahi he
 The absence of caste panchayats among the upper castes of Aryamool also signifies the casteless condition of the original Arya Samaj
 parantu hindu samaaj main jatiyon kaa moulik mahatv he or ye varno se bhinn hai
 There is no less number of people whose character is uncertain and controversial, while the caste of all is definite and beyond doubt
 varno kaa saamaajik maryadakram asandigdh or nishchit he, jabaki jatiyon kaa ek seemaa tak nishchit hote hue bhi sandigdh or vivaadaaspad rahata he
 From the point of view of social dignity, castes are local and regional and varnas are universal, ie, caste differences lead to decorum
 varnavyavastha main do varno ke bich vivahasambandh nishiddh nahin he, keval pratilom vivaah nishiddh he
 Inter-caste marriage is strictly prohibited in the caste system
 varna samaaj kii kriyaatmak vaastavik ikaiyaan nahin hai or jatitatv jivan ke praaia: sabhi angon main samavisht he
 The mobility of varnas is blocked due to caste and it is impossible for a person to change in the same way as jatantar, because the person is basically related to caste and can be mutated along with caste itself
 varnavibhaajan main kisi jati kaa sthaan uski saamaajik pratishtha kaa dyotak he
 Although Antyaj or untouchable castes are part of Hindu society, they have no place in Varna system
 dakshin bharat main kshatriya tathaa vaisya varnan kii maanya jatiyaan hai hi nahin
 The castes who have adopted the profession of these varnas are still considered as Shudras, although they all claim to be Kshatriyas or Vaishyas
 kerala ke rajwanshon tak kii yahi sthiti thi
 The karmism of Hindus provided religious shelter to the caste system and this shelter is important in terms of making the caste firm and stable
 jati ke saath saamaanya hindu kaa tadatmya dharm kii upeksha or avagya kar saktaa he kintu jaateey bandhanon, prathaon or aachaar vyavhaar kaa ulanghan uske liye kathin he
 In fact, there is no difference of religion and caste in the perception of most people

 The ethnic mix is widespread among the ethnic groups of India and this mixture differs among different castes, sub-castes and regions

 After Nigrito, probably Nishad mankind made its debut in India, whose physical features are long cranial, pristine nostrils, medium height and curly hair and chalky shyamal varna
 nishadon kaa mishran samast bharat main or visheshkar choti jatiyon main adhik he
 Most of the wild species of South and Kol Santhal, Munda and Bhil are basically tribes of this dynasty

 The influence of the long cranial and middle nasal and black variegated Dravidian caste is most on South India
 kintu madhya or samast uttar bharat kii aabaadi main bhi iskaa vyapak mishran he
 It seems that the Dravidian caste blended with Nishad, Kirat and Arya blood in North India and these people adopted the Aryan languages

 Thus we see that there is a mixture of Nigritas, Nishad, Dravidian Kirat and Aryan castes in India

 In the state of Bihar, the government has placed 27 Muslim castes in the list of backward classes

 Leather work, cleaning of stool urine, washing of clothes etc

 The meat of dead animals, insectivorous sugarcane and carnivorous jackal, dog, cat etc

 Religious rites and their methods also have great importance
 striyon kaa punarvivaah or vidhwavivaah ucch jatiyon main nishiddh or nimna jatiyon main sweekrut he
 This prohibition is considered religious and culturally good

 Although the ethnic dynamics exist in all levels of Hindu society, within the same level and between different levels, yet it remains impossible for the tribes of castes to reach the upper levels
 aisa bhi dekha gaya he ki sanskaar, sampatti or satta kii drushti se unnat hone par bhi kisi jati ke ucch shrenee sambandhi daawey ko manyata nahin mili
 However, in the modern era, ethnic mobility is increasing in many directions

 Highly empowered people through the English language who hold high government positions or have progressed in industry and trade, are changing their food habits and living habits and do not follow or ignore caste ethics

 parantu vivaah ab bhi apni jati ke hi andar hota he, yadhyapi is disha main bhi parivartan parilakshith hai
 Marriage among the sub-castes of many castes has become smooth and inter-caste marriages have started to be accepted, especially among the upper castes

 From the point of view of Indian constitution and law, untouchability is a punishable offense
