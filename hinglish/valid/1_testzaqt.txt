 quark ek praathmik kan he tathaa yah padaarth kaa mul ghatak he
 Quarks combine to form composite particles hadrons, protons and neutrons, the main components of the atomic nucleus, are the most stable of these
 naiysargik ghatana rang bandhan ke kaaran, quark naa kabhi sidhe prekshit hua yaa ekant main paaya gaya; ve keval hedronon ke bheetar paye ja sakate he, jaise ki beriwanon or mesonon ke rup main
 Quarks have many intrinsic properties, including electric charge, mass, color charge, and spin
 kan bhautikee ke maanak model main quark ekmaatr praathmik kan he jo sabhi chaar moolbhoot antahkriya yaa moulik balon ko mahasoos karata he, saath hi yah maatr gyaat kan he jiskaa vidyut aavesh praathmik aavesh kaa purnank gunanfal nahin he
 There are six types of quarks, known by flavors: up, down, strain, charm, top, and bottom
 ap va down quark ke dravyaman sabhi quarko main sabase kam he
 Relatively heavy quarks are rapidly converted into up and down quarks through the process of annular decay
 kanika kshay, ek ucch dravya avasthaa kaa ek nimna dravya avasthaa main parivartan he
 Because of this, up and down quarks are generally stable and are the most common in the universe, while strains, charms, bottoms, and top quarks can only be generated in high-energy collisions
 har quark flavor ke pratikan hote he jinke pariman to quark ke baraabar hote he parantu chinh vipareet rakhte he tathaa yah antiquark ke rup main jane jate he
 The quark model was independently proposed in 1964 by physicists Murray gell-mann and George Wiig
 quark hedronon ke ang ke rup main pesh kiye gaye the
 Until the experiment at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in 1968, there was little evidence of their physical existence
 twarak prayogon ne sabhi chah flavoron ke liye pramaan pradaan kiye
 Top Quark was last discovered in 1995 on Fermilab
 quark moolbhoot kan main se ek he, jisase padaarth banataa he
 Protons and neutrons are made up of these basic particles
 quark ko unke flavor se janaa jaataa he or yah chh: prakaar ke hote hai:-ap quark, charm quark, taap quark, down quark, strinj quark or batom quark
 The symbols for these are u, c, t, d, s and b respectively
 pehle teen prakaar ke quark ap-tip quark tathaa shesh down-tip quark kehalaate hai
 The mass of the up and down quarks is the lowest of all quarks
 baari dravyaman vaale quark, dravyaman ke kshay ke kaaran teji se ap va down quark main parivartit hote hai, kyonki ap va down quark saadharantaya sthaayee hote hai or brahmand main sabase adhik paye jate hai
 Antimatter of quark is called {anti partical} anti-quark, each type of quark has antimatter, which is called anti-up quark xxrep 4 - anti-bottom quark respectively
 quark akele nahin paye jate, varan hamensha samooh main paye jate he
 The components consisting of quarks are called hadrons
 teen quark ke sanyonjan se beryon {baryons}, teen anti-quark ke sangyojan se anti-beryon tathaa ek quark evam ek anti-quark ke sangyojan se meson banate he
 Protons are formed by combining two up quarks and one down quark, and neutrons are formed by combining one up quark and two down quarks
 beryaan, mesaan, proton, neutron, newclian {ek proton + ek neutron} or parmaanu nabhik, yah sabhi hedron kehalaate he kyonki sabhi quark se milakar bane hote he
 The statistical behavior of quarks is fermion
 quark main kai prakaar ke gun hote he, jaise vidyut aavesh, rang aavesh, bhrami yaa prachakran {spin} or dravyaman
 All these properties are also found in antimatter, but are opposite
 ap-tip quark kaa vidyut aavesh +2 / 3 or down-tip quark kaa -1 / 3 hota he
 The antagonism of their antagonism is -2 / 3 and +1 / 3 respectively
 quark ke sangyojan se banane vaale kano kaa vidyut aavesh, usamen paye jane vaale quarko ke kul vidyut aavesho ke yoga ke baraabar hota he
 For example, the electric charge of a proton is equal to the sum of the electric charges of two up-quarks and one down-quark, that is, 1
 isi tarah neutron kaa vidyut aavesh shunya hota he
 Main article: weak interaction kan bhautikee kii chaar moolbhoot antahkriya on main se ek, keval durbal antahkriya ke madhyam se ek flavor kaa quark kisi anya flavor ke quark main tabdeel ho saktaa he
 By absorbing or emitting a w boson, one can convert any up-type quark to any down-type quark and vice versa
 yah flavor parivartan tantra beta kshay kii radiodharmee prakriya kaa kaaran banataa he, jisamen ek neutron kaa ek proton, ek electron or ek electron antinutrino main "vibhaajan" ho jaataa he 
 This occurs when a virtual W− of a down quark in a neutron decays into an up quark by a boson emitter and turns the neutron into a proton
 W− boson phir ek electron or ek electron antinutrino main tut jaataa he
 According to quantum chromodynamics, quarks possess properties called innate color charge
 teen tarah ke rang aavesh hote he- haraa, laal, or nila
 Similarly, there are three charges per color - magenta, cyan and yellow
 har quark ek rang vahan karte he, jabaki prayek antiquark prati rang vahan karte he
 Color charges occur only in quarks and gluons
 dhyaan rahe, rang aavesh kaa drishy prakaash ke rang varnakram se koi sambandh nahin he
 The system of attraction and repulsion between charges of quarks with different combinations of three colors is called a strong interaction, mediated by a force carrier particle called a gluon; It is discussed in detail below
 vah siddhant jo prabal antahkriyaaon ko bataata he kwantum chromodynamiks kehalaata he
 a quark, which will have a single color value, can form a bound system with an antiquark carrying the corresponding anticolor
 The result of two attracting quarks will be color neutrality: a quark with color charge ξ plus an antiquark with color charge −ξ will result in a color charge of 0 and the formation of a meson
 This is analogous to the additive color model in basic optics
 Similarly, the combination of three quarks, each with different color charges, or three antiquarks, each with anticolor charges, will result in the same "white" color charge and the formation of a baryon or antibaryon
 quark kii bhrami yaa prachakran 1 / 2 hoti he

 The credit of expanding and strengthening the Mauryan Empire goes to Emperor Ashoka
 yah samrajya purv main magadh rajya main ganga nadi ke maidaanon se shuru hua
 Its capital was Pataliputra
 chandragupta maury ne 322 isa purv main is samrajya kii sthapana kii or teji se pashchim kii taraf apana samrajya kaa vikaas kiya
 He took advantage of the differences of several small regional states which were born after the invasion of Alexander

 The Maurya dynasty greatly expanded in the kingdom of Chakravarti Emperor Ashoka
 samraat ashok ke kaaran hi maury samrajya sabase mahaan evam shaktishaalee banakar vishvabhar main prasiddh hua
 In 325 BCE, northwestern India was ruled by the satrap of Sikandar
 jab sikandar punjab par chadhaai kar rahaa tha to ek brahman jiskaa naam chanakya tha magadh ko samrajya vistaar ke liye protsaahit karne aayaa
 At that time, Magadha was quite powerful and pricked the eyes of its neighboring states
 par tatkaaleen magadh ke samraat ghananand ne usko thukraa diya
 He said that you are a pundit and take care of your peak "war is the king's job, you are a pundit, only do panditai"
 Since then Chanakya took a vow that he would teach Dhanananda a lesson
 maury pracheen kshatriya kabeeley ke hisse rahe he
 According to Greek sources such as Brahmin literature, Visakhadatta Mudrarakshas and Justin, etc
, there were no opinions of historians about the origin of Maurya
 Some scholars also believe that Chandragupta Maurya has originated from his mother Mura
 Maurya is, they were the clan that followed the peacocks
 parantu yah bhi sateek nahi baithta bhartiya itihaas main yah pehali baar hua mata ke naam se putr kaa vansh chalaa ho maury ek shaktishaalee vansh tha vah unke pita se viraasat main mili thi putr kaa naam pita se hi judaa hota he, unki utpatti vrushal vansh se huyi thi, lekin iskaa koi bhi pramaan itihaas main uplabdh nahin he yah keval tark he kuki ajtak itihaas main kisi ne bhi apane vansh kaa naam mata ke naam se nahin rakhaa, to kuch itihaaskaaro kaa yah sirf anumaan he
 
 chandragupta usee gana pramukh kaa putr tha jo kii chandragupta ke bal avasthaa main hi yoddha ke rup main maaraa gaya
 Chandragupta had the natural qualities to become a king ', seeing this ability, Chanakya made him his disciple, and laid the foundation of a strong nation which is an ideal till date
 iske baad bharat bhar main jasuson kaa ek jaal sa bicha diya gaya jisase raja ke khilaaf gaddari ityadi kii gupt soochna ekatra karne main kiya jaataa tha - yah bharat main shaayad abhootpurv tha
 Once this happened, he prepared Chandragupta to drive away the Greek satraps
 is kaary main use guptcharon ke vistrut jaal se madad mili
 In the invasion of Magadha, Chanakya provoked civil war in Magadha
 uske guptcharon ne nand ke adhikariyon ko rishwat dekar unhe apane paksh main kar liya
 After this, the Nanda ruler left his post and Chanakya got Vijayashree
 nand ko nirvasit jivan jeena padaa jiske baad uskaa kya hua ye agyaat he
 Chandragupta Maurya also won the public's trust and with this he also got the right to power

 After the capture of Magadha, Chandragupta occupied the center of power
 chandragupta ne pashchimi tathaa dakshini bharat par vijay abhiyaan aarambh kiya
 Its information comes from indirect evidence
 rudradaaman ke junagarh shilaalekh main likhaa he ki sinchai ke liye sudarshan jhil par ek band pushyagupt dwaara banaaya gaya tha
 Pushyagupta was the provincial governor of Ashoka at that time
 pashchimottar bharat ko unani shashan se mukti dilaane ke baad uskaa dhyaan dakshin kii taraf gaya
 Chandragupta defeated Alexander's commander Seleucus around 305 BC
 greek vivaran is vijay kaa ullekh nahin karte hai par itnaa kehete hai ki chandragupta or celukas ke bich ek sandhi hui thi jiske anusaar celukas ne qandahar, kabul, heraat or baluchistan ke pradesh chandragupta ko de die the
 With this, Chandragupta presented him 500 elephants
 itnaa bhi kaha jaataa he chandragupta ne celukas kii beti se vaivaahik sambandh sthapit kiya tha
 Seleucus sent Megasthenes to the court of Chandragupta as ambassador
 plutark ke anusaar "sandrokotus us samay tak singhasanarudh ho chukaa tha, usne apane 6,00,000 sainikon kii sena se sampoorn bharat ko rond daalaa or apane adheen kar liya"
 This comment may be called a little exaggeration because it is known that the Cauvery river and its south areas were ruled by the Cholas, Pandyas, Satyaputras and Keralaputras at that time

 Similarly, many scholars have expressed their views regarding it in their own way
 german kavi gete mahoday ne abhigyanshakuntalam or meghdutam ke samaan hi gitgovind kii bhuri-bhuri prashansa kii he
 In the Geetgovind poetry, Jayadev mentions Jagdish as Jagannath, Dashavatari, Hari, Murari, Madhuripu, Keshav, Madhav, Krishna, etc

 The description of Geetgovind is comparable to the description of Srimad Bhagwat; And in the Akrur eulogy in Srimad 10, chapter 40 of Srimad Bhagwat, which describes Dashavatara, it corresponds to the praise description of the first canto of Geetgovind

 But the inscriptions and ancient temples which are present in Odisha proved that Jayadev was a devotee of Jagannath and a resident of Utkal kingdom

 Pichel accepts this poem as a 'musical metaphor'

 It is worth mentioning here that in this poetry there is nothing like drama, preface etc
 kuch vidvan ise ‘shringaar mahakavy’ kii sangya bhi dete hai
 Krishnaswamy Iyengar, in his book 'A History of Indian Opera', has considered 'gitagovind' poetry as a complete form of music and its development and excellent acceptance in the sixteenth-century Sri Tirthanarayana Swamy's work 'krishnilila Tarangini'

 On this basis, this poem can also be considered as 'musical form'

 In this context, in the 'geetgovind' poetry, a beautiful description of Rituraj Vasant, chandra-jyotsna, Surbhit Samir and the seductive keys of the Yamuna coast is seen
 yahaan tak ki is kavy main pakshi tak prem kii shakti or mahima kaa gaan karte hue drushtigochar hote hai
 Jayadeva has used the Vaidarbhi ritual — a style of melodious expressive characters — in this poem
 kavy main kahin-kahin deergh samaason kaa prayog avashya hua he, parantu phir bhi durbodhata athwa clishtataa nahin aane paayi
 In fact, the poet had composed songs only for the songs of the common people on special festivals

 The songs not only have exceptional naturalness, but they also have unique melody

 It is clear from the study of poetry that the poet has an amazing ability to make a considerable impact on his readers and listeners, by the rapid stream of short posts, and sometimes by the rhythmic movement of long notes composed with tact

 is prakaar ‘gitgovind’ main apanaayi gayi abhinav rachana-pranali main varna, samvaad or geet paraspar is prakaar gunth gayi hai ki unase ek vilakshan anand kii anubhuti hoti he
 Jaidev, the inventor of this unique composition-style, is his own superior
 radha-krishna kii keli-kathaon tathaa unki abhisar-lilaon kaa rasmay chithran ‘gitgovind’ ko aadhyatmik shringaar kaa manoram granth bana detaa he
 This poetic portrayal of radha-krishna's love of life in various poems of love — hope, despair, excitement, jealousy, anger, honor, resentment, ecstasy, message-sending and union, etc
 — is in this poem
 One does not find anywhere even when searching elsewhere
 shrikrishna ke gopiyon ke saath raas-vilaas ko radha na pasand karti he or na hi sahan kar paati hai
 Radha sends her resentment to Shri Krishna through her sakhi, but that unique praniyani is not satisfied with this much, her loving dependence-heart makes her personally reveal her deep affection towards her beloved
 
 radha ke aane par shrikrishna braj-sundariyon kaa sang chhodkar uski ore unmukh hote hai
 Radha's sakhi is a poignant description of the intense affection of Shri Krishna to Radha and Radha to Sri Krishna with each other and the transcendental pain experienced when they are away from each other
 vah apane komal evam kamaneey vachanon dwaara donon ko ek-duusare se milane ke liye prerit karti he
 Radha, impatient with the pangs of anguish when it is moonlight, is unable to control her incestuous affection and is forced into her expression
 shrikrishna ke aane par ati maan karti hui radha upalambh se bhare vachanon ke dwaara unke prati apana rosh-aakrosh prakat karti he
 Here, Radha's friend requests Radha to leave Maan, while Sri Krishna himself tries to persuade and make him friendly, while praising Radha's beauty and beauty
 antatah radha kaa maan dur ho jaataa he or vah apane kaant se milane ke liye kadamb-kunj main jaati he
 While praying to Shri Krishna Radha there, plead with him to give up shame and inhibition and to cooperate in the rituals
 donon prasann man se rati krida main pravrutt hote hai or iske uparant radha pranaysikt vachanon se apane priyatam shrikrishna se apana shringaar karne ko kahati he
 Giving glory to his pranapriya's request, Shri Krishna gladly adorns Radha with his own hands
 aaj ke kuch aalochak jayadev par bhakthi ke aalamban radha-krishna ko shringaar kaa aalamban banane kaa doshaaropan karte hai, parantu maadhurya bhav ke upaask kavi par yah laanchhan anyaaypurna hi nahin, apitu swayan unke apane avivek kaa dyotak he
 In fact, the expression of extreme elitism of solitude or immersion available in married couples, and the expression of clairvoyance of the imagination of the impenetrable in distinction, creates a sense of melody in the field of devotion
 madhur bhav se bhajan karne vaale bhakton ke liye bhagwaan kii shringarik cheshtaaen, vilaas-lilaayen tathaa prem-gaathaayen hi gey evam kirtaneey hai
 It is worth mentioning here that scholars have accepted all this poetry as an 'unprepared praise', an attempt to express the satire hidden in the talk
 unke mat ke anusaar shrikrishna ‘jeevon kii aatma’ ke pratik hai
 The game of gopis is that type of prapancha, in which the souls of humans trapped in ignorance are wandering
 radha brahmanand kaa pratik he, jise praapt karne par hi jeevatma ko charam sukh kii prapti hoti he
 According to some scholars, Jayadev was not a worshiper of Radha but was a worshiper of Shri Krishna
 atah shrikrishna manushyon kii aatma ke pratik na hokar paramatma ke pratik hai
 Acclaiming this fact, Acharya Baldev Upadhyaya writes - "shringar-shiromani Sri Krishna is the representative of Bhagavat-tattva and his beloved gopikas are the symbol of the creature
 radha-krishna kaa milan jeev-brahm kaa milan he
 In this way, the mystery of many facts of cultivation path is solved here
 ’’ 'gitagovind' is indeed a unique and wonderful book, in which the stream of mysterious melody is flowing in the end of boisterous beauty
 samgr sanskrit sahitya main is koti kii madhur rachana duusari koi nahi
 If you want to observe the culmination of beauty and melody of Sanskrit Bharati, then 'geetagovind' should be followed
 iske shabdachitron se soundarya maano chhalakta he
 The elegance of its songs communicates supernatural melody
 iske chhandon kaa naad-soundarya apurv anand pradaan karata he
 The harmony of words and meanings is so enchanting that even a person unfamiliar with Sanskrit cannot live without being influenced by it
 isaki-si komalkant padaavalee sansar kii kisi bhi bhashaa ke kavy main durlabh he
 Even in long spells used in this poetry, there is unique prasadikta and melody
 anupras ke prayog main to kavi adwitiya he
 The use of alliteration in his songs continues not only at the end of the posts but also in the middle
 lalit chhandon or komalkant padaavalee kaa aisa mani-kanchan sanyog hua he ki geeton ke uccharan maatr se sahrudayon ke hriday main tadnurup ras kaa aavirbhaav evam sanchaar hone lagata he
 This unique style has proved very meaningful for the euphemism of dressing
 ‘gitgovind’ ko badi hi prasiddhi or lokapriyata mili
 The village in which Jaidev lived and composed 'geetgovind', the name of that village became Jaidevpur
 kavi ke samakaleen urisa ke shaasha raja pratap rudradev ne apane rajya ke gayakon, sangitagnon or nartakon ke liye ‘gitgovind’ ke padon ko gane kaa aadesh jari kar diya
 Maharaj honored Jayadev with the title of 'kaviraj Raja' for this poetic composition
 ‘gitgovind’ jayadev ke jivan kaal main hi paryaapt rup se prachlit evam lokapriy ho gaya tha—iske anek pramaan milte hai
 In the south, it became so popular that its verses were carved in the Dravin script on the stairs of the temple of Tirupati Balaji
 shreevallabh sampradaay main to shrimadbhagwat puraana ke samaan isaki pratishtha he
 There is a belief among Vaishnavas that where 'geetagovind' is sung, there is a presence of God
 isi se is sampradaay main ise ayogy sthaan par na gaaye jane kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he, jiskaa kathorta se paalan kiya jaataa he
 In the Vaishnava community, the poet Jayadeva is considered to be the chief noble of the medieval state of this community
 sampradaay main prachlit nimnokt padya ke anusaar jis vaishnav sampradaay ke pravartan vishnu swami ne kiya or jiskaa sanvardhan mahaprabhu vallabhacharya ne kiya, us sampradaay ko in donon mahanubhavon ke madhya main bhakt kavi jayadev ne sangrakshan diya
 In this way Jayadeva is also worshipable as a Guru in the Vaishnava sect
 jayadev ne ‘gitgovind’ kii rachana karke sanskrit main ek naveen rachana-pranali kaa avishkaar kiya
 Many songs such as 'abhinav Geetagovind', 'geetraghava', 'geetagadhar' and 'krishnagit' were composed in Sanskrit on the emulation of 'gitagovind', but no poet was able to bring excellence like 'geetgovind' in his poetry
 idhar hindi main bharatendu harishchandr ne brajabhasha main iske anuwaad kaa prayaas kiya, parantu ‘sachhee kavita’ kaa anuwaad to ho hi nahin saktaa—yah ukti ‘gitgovind’ ke sambandh main aksharshah satya siddh hui he
 The translation of the essence of the original composition in translation is difficult, if not impossible
 sar wiliam jones dwaara angl bhashaa main kiye gayi ‘gitgovind’ kavy ke anuwaad par german kavi gete kii tippanee badi hi sateek he
 'A Real Poetry is that, which cannot be translated
' That is, the basis of identification of excellent poetry is that it cannot be translated into another language
 ‘gitgovind’ ke marm ko samajhane tathaa sahrudayon tak uske soundarya ko sampreshya banane ke liye pantis vidwaanon ke prayaas uplabdh hai, parantu yah kavy to vah agaadh sagar he ki isamen jo jitani gahari dubkee lagaataa he
 Equally rare and precious gems come in his hand
 katipay kaviyon dwaara is kavy ke anukaran par kavy-rachana karnaa jayadev kii kirti-kaumudi kii ujjvalata tathaa utkrushtataa kii sweekruti kaa hi parichaayak he
 The 'geetagovind' poem of devotion, adornment and poetry has another significant significance in krishna-bhakti literature
 yah sarvajan vidit tathy he ki is kavy se purv shrikrishna kii preyasi athwa patni ke rup main rukmini tathaa satyabhama aadi kaa naam hi liya jaataa tha
 There was no existence of a woman named Radha
 shrimadbhagwat puraana main ‘anairadhito nunam’ shrikrishna kii aradhana karne vaali kisi ek gopi kaa ullekh avashya hua he, parantu krishna-kavy main krishna ke saath judane vaali krishna ke hi samakaksh mahatva praapt karne vaali shrikrishna kii premika-patni radha kaa ullekh kahin nahin hua
 'geetagovindakar' Jaidev has the credit for making Radha distinguished at this high place — the exclusive companion of Shri Krishna and integral to him and his eternal strength
 is granth main chitrit radha-krishna ke nity-vilaas ke aadhaar par hi brahmavaivart puraana main radha-krishna kii shringaar-cheshtaaon tathaa kaam-kridaaon kaa varnan hua he, parantu yah ek kathor satya he ki puranakar na to ‘gitgovind’ kavy ke varnan jaisi maryaada or shaleenta kaa nirvaah kar sakaa he or na hi varnan ko vaisaa saras, rochak evam hridaygrahya bana sakaa he
 In this area too, Jaidev is his superior
 is aadhaar par hi kadachit krishna-bhakthi sahitya main ‘gitgovind’ kavy ko dharmagranth kaa gaurav praapt he

 Has received the title of
 pratham mahayuddh ke samay san 1914–1918 tak luther gulik ne rashtriya raksha parishad ne apane mahatvapurn kaaryon kaa sampaadan kiya
 Between 1960–62 AD, he served as president of the Institute of Public Administration, New York
 luther gulik ne ek professor ke rup main kaary karne ke saath-saath prashasnic salaahkaar ke rup main bhi kaary kiya
 Luther Gulick had experience and knowledge of general administration as well as military and industrial administration
 yahi kaaran tha ki unhone vibhinn siddhanton kaa pratipaadan kiya
 Luther Gulick's contribution to the field of writing is no less
 unhone prashasan or prabandh par kai pustakon kii rachana kii evam lekh prakashit karaayaa
 Prominent among his compositions are- lok prashasan ke prati luther gulik ke yogadan ko nimnlikhit sheershakon ke antargat prastut kiya ja saktaa he – Public administration is a dynamic and developing subject
 isliye iske kaary kshetra ko sunishchit karnaa kathin evam duruh kaary he
 This is a subject related to the state and the state faces various new problems, which it has to find out
 lok kalyankari rajya ke lakshya prapti ke sadanrbh main to lok prashasan kaa kaary kshetra or vyapak ho gaya he tathaa iske mahatv main bhi jabardast vruddhi hui he
 There is a difference of opinion among scholars regarding the field of public administration
 jahaan tak luther gulik ke mat kaa sawaal he to unhone lok prashasan main saamaanya kaaryon ke atirikt prashasan kii karypalika shakha ke kaaryon ko shaamil kiya he
 An attempt has been made by Luther Gulick to clarify administration and public administration
 prashasan ke sambandh main luther gulik kehete he ki prashasan kaa sambandh kaary samaapti or nirdhaarit uddeshyon kii paripurti se he
 Defining public administration, he said that- luther gulik ne Papers on the Science of Administration, naamak apni pustak main sanghathan ke siddhanton kii suchi nimnlikhit rup main prastut kii he – Division of work vibhageeya sanghathanon ke aadhaar Footsteps saudeshy samanvay Coordination under committees vikendrikaran Odity unity line tathaa staff Delegation niyantran kaa kshetra Luther Gulick has tried to clarify the functions of the Chief Executive by 'postcar formula'
 gulik kaa vichaar he ki postcarb kaa formula mukhya karypalak ke kaaryon ke kaaryaatmak pakshon kii vivechna karata he
 Each word in the formula expresses some or the other activity, which is as follows: p–planning niyojan o – Organizing Organization s–slatping carmik varg d – Directing Instructions "'C"' - Control
 Co – Coordinator Coordination r–reporting report b – Budgeting Budget sanghathan kii sakriyata, kaary–kushalta evam safalataa ke liye use suvidhanusaar vibhinn vibhaagon evam upavibhaago main vibhajit karnaa aavashyak hota he
 In addition, it is also necessary that the organization's subdivision or subdivision together perform the tasks
 isi sandarbh main luther gulik ne vibhageeya sanghathano ke nirmaan ke chaar pramukh aadhaar batalaayen hai – When an organization is created with a particular purpose or function in view, it is called the functional principle of the organization
 vastav main vibhageeya sanghathanon kaa mukhya aadhaar kaary athwa lakshya hi hota he
 This is the priority in building all kinds of organizations
 vibhageeya sanghathan ke nirmaan ke dwitiya aadhaar ke rup main luther gulik ne prakriya ko rakhaa he
 The process refers to the ability and knowledge that is related to the tendency of specialization
 prakriya ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi sanghathan kaa vibhaajan kiya jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye – chikitsa vibhaag, shiksha vibhaag, praudyogiki vibhaag aadi
 Luther Mullick has placed individuals as the third basis for the creation of a departmental organization
 sabhi prakaar ke sanghathanon kii visheshta hoti he ki vah sabhi prakaar kii seva va suvidha un vyaktiyon ko uplabdh karaaye jinako dhyaan main rakhkar sanghathan kaa gathan kiya gaya he
 The basis of establishment of rehabilitation department, social welfare department, welfare institute for minorities etc
 are the individuals
 luther gulik ne sthaan ko bhi vibhageeya sanghathan kaa ek aadhaar mana he
 Location is very important in the establishment of departments
 sanghathan main niyantran kaa kshetra, aadesh kii ekta, samanvay tathaa sanchaar aadi sthaan se prabhavit hote he
 The various divisions of the State Department are based on 'location' for quick execution of works

 shriimatii = glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa = with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii = great, city; dasha cha dve = ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani = yojana-s; aayataa = lengthy; triini vistiirnaa = three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this: 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles

 aise kaatanevaale aujaar chaaku, funni or chheni hai
 In the cutting of soft things like fruits, flowers, vegetables, knife is used for cutting wood, and the chisel is used for cutting metals
 ye aujaar kathor, chimde or drudh ispaat ke bane hote hai
 How the angle of cutting edge should be depends on the hardness of the object to be cut
 chaaku se kaatane par lagbhag 5 degree kaa kone, funni se kaatane par kam se kam 12 degree kaa kone or chheni se kaatane par 30 degree se 65 degree kaa kone rahanaa chahie
 It is necessary to have an angle of 30 ° for cutting aluminum, 45 ° for copper, 55 to 65 ° for steel and 65 ° for cast steel
 aujaar kii nok ko, kaate janevaale padaarth par, kataai kii jagah uchit prakaar se thaamna bhi mahatv kaa he
 By the word "cutting" we generally understand that an object has to be cut into pieces or cut into small pieces, but instead of cutting a metal with a chisel, it is the act of tearing
 vastut: chheni se kaatane par teen kriyaayein saath saath chalati hai
 One, tearing the metal, the second removing the chipping, and the third is to clean and clean the torn rag

 The same principle also applies to the tools of cutting of materials with tools such as lathe, plana, borer etc
 dhaatu ke kharadane main batali kaa upyog hota he
 How much the angle of edge of Batali should remain depends on the nature of the metal being cut
 batali kii dhar bahut tej rahane se koi laabh nahin hota, kyonki sheeghra hi vah moti ho jaati he
 The exit angle of battalions for cutting various metals can range from 0 ° to 40 °
 batliyon kii nok par antar kone utana hi bananaa chahie jitna bina gharshan kii kataai ke liye atyant aavashyak ho
 It can range from 6 degrees to 17 degrees

 Tapes from 1 / 16 inch to 1 / 8 inch diameter often have 3 lanes, 4 lanes for tapes from 5 / 23 inch to a quarter inch diameter, and 6 lanes for taps ranging from 15 / 8 inch to 3 inch diameter are made

 Batali moves from right to left while cutting in the lathe machine
 at: uske parshv nikaas kone ko baayein se dahini ore jhukaana padataa he
 But the batley moves from left to right in the rack, so its lateral exit angle has to be made in the opposite direction from the lathe

 Pet Medicine vaikalpik chikitsa paddatiyaan apane mul siddhanton main utani hi vividh hai, jitani apni kaary-vidhiyon main
 ye paddatiyaan paaramparik chikitsa paddati, lok gyaan, aadhyatmik vishwaas yaa upachaar ke nae tareekon par aadhaarit hoti hai
 In jurisdictions where alternative medical practices are sufficiently prevalent, they may be granted a legal license and regulated
 vaikalpik chikitsa ke chikitsakon ke daavon ko saamanytah chikitsa samudaay dwaara sweekaar nahin kiya jaataa, kyonki suraksha tathaa prabhavotpaadakta kaa sakshya-aadhaarit moolyankan yaa to uplabdh nahin hota athwa in paddatiyon ke liye yah puraa hi nahin kiya jaataa
 yadi vaigyanik anusandhan dwaara kisi vaikalpik chikitsa paddati kii suraksha tathaa prabhavotpaadakta kaa pramaan diya jaataa he, to vah mukhya dhara kii chikitsa paddati ban jaati he or “vaikalpik” nahin rah jaati or isliye vah paaramparik chikitsakon dwaara vyapak rup se apana lee jaati he
 Because alternative medicine techniques lack evidence or fail to test frequently, some people have suggested defining them as non-evidence based alternative medicine methods, or purely as a medical practice
 Has given kuch anusandhankarta maanate hai ki cam ko sakshya-aadhaarit vidhiyon ke aadhaar par paribhaashit karne main samasya utpann hogi, kyonki cam kaa pareekshan kiya ja chukaa he tathaa unka maananaa he ki mukhyadhara kii kai paddatiyon main bhi thos pramaan kii kami pai gai he
 In order to see its prevalence, a systematic review of studies conducted in 13 countries in 1998 concluded that approximately 31% of cancer patients use some form of complementary and alternative medicine
 vaikalpik chikitsa paddatiyaan deshon ke aadhaar par badalati rahati hai
 Eddard Ernst says that in Austria and Germany, Cam is primarily in the hands of physicians, while some estimates suggest that at least half of American alternative physicians are physicians
 germany main jadi-bootiyon par kadaa niyantran he, jinamein se aadhi doctoron dwaara di jaati hai tathaa vahaan kii kamishan i kanoon ke aadhaar par swasthya beemaa dwaara shaamil kii gayi hai
 The noun "alternative medicine method" is commonly used to describe methods used independently or in place of traditional medicine
 “poorak chikitsa” shabdaawalee kaa prayog mukhya rup se aisi paddatiyon ko varnit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, jo paaramparik chikitsa paddatiyon ke saath prayukt hoti hai yaa unki poorak hoti hai
 NCCAM suggests that "the use of odor therapy, in which the fragrance of essential oils of flowers, herbs and trees is inhaled to improve and safeguard the health of patients and reduce their discomfort after surgery" Is an example of
 “samakalanaatmak” yaa “samaklit chikitsa” shabdaawaliyaan paaramparik tathaa vaikalpik chikitsa paddatiyon vaale upachaaron ke sangyojan ko suchit karti hai, jinaki prabhavotpaadakta ke liye kuch vaigyanik pramaan maujuud hai; tathaa in paddatiyon ke samarthakon dwaara unhen poorak chikitsa paddati ke sarvottam udhaaharan ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Ralph Cinderman and Andrew Well state that "integrative medicine is not synonymous with complementary and alternative medicine
" Its meaning and purpose is quite broad, in that it focuses on the purpose of medicine on health and healing and emphasizes the centrality of the patient – doctor relationship
 ” rokthaam tathaa jivan-style main parivartan par jor daalane vaali paramparaagat tathaa poorak chikitsa kaa sangyojan hi samaklit chikitsa he
 There is no clear and uniform definition for alternative or complementary medicine
 :17 paashchaatya samskruti main ise praayah aisi upachaar paddati ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he, jo “paaramparik chikitsa paddati ke kshetra main nahin aati” yaa jise “ek samaan rup se prabhaavshaalee nahin dekha gaya
 " naishanal centre for complementary and alternetive medicine cam ko “vividhtapurna chikitsiya tathaa swasthya suraksha pranaaliyon, paddatiyon tathaa utpaadon kaa ek vividhtapurna samooh, jo maujuuda paaramparik chikitsa paddati kaa ang nahin he,” ke rup main varnit karata he
 The Cochrane Complementary Medicine field found that what is considered complementary or alternative medicine in one country can be considered as traditional medical practice in other countries
 isliye unke dwaara di gai paribhaasha saamaanya he: “poorak chikitsa main aisi sabhi paddatiyaan tathaa vichaar shaamil hote hai, jo kai deshon main paaramparik chikitsa kshetra ke baahar hote hai or uske prayogkarta dwaara use bachaavkaari yaa rogopchaari, athwa swasthyavardhak tathaa upachaaratmak ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 "for example, bioremediation is commonly used by the physiotherapy and rehabilitation community, but overall it is considered as alternative medicine in the medical science community, and some herbal medicine practices in Europe are mainstream medicine
" There are methods, but in the US they are considered optional
 ek samakalanaatmak chikitsa shodhakarta david em isonberg, ise is prakaar paribhaashit karte hai, “aise chikitsiya hastkshep jo america chikitsa sansthaanon main vyapak rup main nahin sikhaye jate yaa saamanytah america aspataalon main nahin paae jate,” ensisieem kaa maananaa he ki yadi pehle ke apramanit upachaaron kaa prayog surakshit tathaa prabhaavshaalee ho, to unhen paaramparik chikitsa main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Barry R
, a researcher in complementary and alternative medicine
 Cassileth summarized the case as, "as efforts are underway to integrate CAM into mainstream medicine or to create a separate NIH research institution for" alternative "medicine, not all mainstream physicians are comfortable with CAM is
 ” The National Science Foundation has defined alternative medicine as "all medical practices that have not been proven effective by scientific methods"
 instyitute of medicine ne varsh 2005 main poorak tathaa vaikalpik chikitsa paddatiyon ko ek vishesh samskruti tathaa aitihaasik avadhi main gaiyr-prabhavi chikitsiya vidhi ke rup main paribhaashit kiya
 Cochrane Collaboration and official government bodies such as the UK Department of Health have adopted one such definition
 sakshya-aadhaarit chikitsa paddatiyon ke samarthak, jaise cocran colaboreshan vaikalpik chikitsa jaise shabdon kaa prayog karte hai, par ve is baat se sahamat hai ki sabhi upachaar chaahe ve “mukhya dhara” ke hon yaa “vaikalpik” paddati ke hon, vaigyanik vidhiyon ke maanakon ke anusaar kiye jane chahie
 Many mainstream scientists and physicians have commented on and criticized alternative medicine methods
 chikitsa anusandhankartaaon ke bich ek bahes chhidi hui he ki kya kisi upachaar paddati ko sahi tarah se ‘vaikalpik chikitsa’ ke rup main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 Some researchers claim that medical practice is the only one that has been properly tested, and which has not been tested is not a method
 unka maananaa he ki swasthya kii dekhbhaal kii paddatiyon ko pramukh rup se vaigyanik saakshyon par aadhaarit mana janaa chahie
 If a medical system has been rigorously tested and found to be safe and effective, traditional medicine will adopt it, even if it is initially considered 'alternative'
 is prakaar kisi vidhi ke liye yah sambhav he ki isaki prabhaavashiltaa kii vistrut jaankaree yaa uske abhaav ke aadhaar par vah virgon ko parivartan kar de
 Prominent supporters of the idea include George D

 stephen barat, quackwatch ke sansthaapak tathaa sanchaalak, maanate hai ki “vaikalpik’ paddati ke naam vaali chikitsa ko sahi, prayogtmak yaa sandehaaspad ke rup main punarvargeekrut kiya jaae
 yahaan ‘sahi’ ke liye ve aisi vidhiyon kii baat karte hai, jinke paas suraksha tathaa prabhaavashiltaa ke spasht pramaan hon, prayogtmak ve hai, jo apramanit hone ke baad bhi prabhaavashiltaa ke liye satyabhaasi muladhar detii hai, tathaa sandehaaspad, jo vaigyanik rup se satyabhaasi muladhar ke bina aadharahin hon
 unhen isaki chintaa he ki chunki kuch “vaikalpik” chikitsa-paddatiyon ke apane gun hote hai, atah baaki ke liye yahi maan liya jaataa he ki unamem bhi khubiyaan hongi, par adhiktar bekaar hoti hai
 He says that it is nth's policy to never say that such a method is not effective, but that a different version or dose may have different consequences
 poorak chikitsa ke professor, adjard arnst kai vaikalpik takneekon ke saakshyon ko kamjor, astitvaviheen yaa nakaaratmak maanate hai, par unka kahana he ki anya ke sakshya uplabdh hai, visheshkar kuch jadi-bootiyon tathaa acupanchar ke liye
 Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist, defines alternative medicine as "a set of methods that cannot be tested, deny testing, or consistently fail to test
" They say that if the technique is found effective in any of the appropriate tests performed, it becomes a medical rather than an alternative

 In 2009, a group of scientists proposed to close the National Center for Complimentary and Alternative Medicine
 unka kahana tha ki bahut saare adhyayan sharirkriya vigyaan tathaa rogon kii apaaramparik samaj par aadhaarit the or unke prabhaav yaa to nahin the yaa kaaphi kam the
 His next argument was that more parsimonious interventions in the region, such as diet, rest, yoga, and botanical medicine, could be studied in other parts of NTH, where they would have to compete with traditional research projects

 ” aisi bhi chintaaen hai ki keval enech ke samarthan ko “bagaiyr vaidhata vaali upachaar paddati ko ansthaapit vaidhata pradaan karne" ke liye prayog kiya ja rahaa he
 Wallace Simpson, editor of the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine and Professor at Stanford University, writes that cam is "a proliferation of frivolous things," an example of how alternative and complementary medicine were used in place of quackery, skepticism, unreliability
 And he has expressed concern that Cam harbors a paradox without any reason or use
 da washington post ullekh karata he ki paaramparik rup se prashikshit chikitsakon kii ek badi sankhya samakalanaatmak chikitsa ko vyavhaar main laati he, jise “aisi paaramparik swasthya dekhbhaal ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he, jisamen acupanchar, reki, tathaa jadi-booti vaali upachaar ranneetiyaan shaamil hai
 "australian comedian Tim Minkin states in his nine-minute beat poem" Storm "that alternative medicine is one that" either could not be proven to work or could not be proven to work
 " And then he jokes, "you know what the 'alternative medicine' that has been proven to work, is called?" Treatment"

, a leading proponent of integrative medicine
 According to the principles of integrative medicine include, proper use of traditional and cam methods; Patient participation, healing, and healing and natural and minimally modulated methods
 a survey conducted in 1997 found that 13
