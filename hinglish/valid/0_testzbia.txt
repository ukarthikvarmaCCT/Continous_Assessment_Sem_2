 gunasutra yaa chromosome sabhi vanaspatiyon va praaniyon kii koshikaon main paye jane vaale tantu rupi pind hote hai, jo ki sabhi anuvaanshik gunon ko nirdhaarit va sanchaarit karte hai
 The number of chromosomes in each species remains fixed
 maanav koshika main gunasutron kii sankhya 46 hoti he jo 23 ke jode main hote he
 Of these, 22 chromosomes are identical in male and female and homologous to their pairs
 inhen sammilit rup se samajaat gunasutra kehete he
 The chromosomes of the 23rd pair are not the same between men and women, which are called heterogeneous chromosomes
 gunasutra kii sanrachana main do padaarth visheshat: sanmilit rahete hai- DNA is the only genetic material
 di e na e anu kii sanrachana main chaar carbonic samaakshar sammilit hote hai : do purine, do pirimidine, ek chini-dioxyribose or phosforic amla 
 Purine contains adenine and guanine, and pyrimidine has thymine and cytosine
 di en e ke ek anu main do sutara hote hai, jo ek duusare ke chaaron or sarpil rup main valayit hote he
 Each DNA formula consists of one or more of the four organic cells in this sequence - thymine, cytosine, adenine, and guanine, and they are interconnected in a particular way
 in chaar samaakshaaron or unase sambandhit sharkara or phophoric amla anu kaa ek ekak tetraneucliotid hota he or kai sahastra tetraneucliotidon kaa ek di en e anu banataa he
 The reason for the variation of DNA of different beings is the difference in the sequence of cells
 di en e or aisa hi ek doosraa newcliik amla aar en e carbonic samaakshar kii upasthiti ke kaaran parabangnee ko adhikansh 2,600 angstrom ke kshetra main antarleen karte hai
 On this basis, a quantitative quantitative arrival of DNA is made
 praaniyon main do vishesh prakaar ke centresutra paae jate hai
 One is found in some dipterra insecta in the nuclei of the ovarian ligaments
 ye gunasutra usee jati ke saadhaaran gunasutron kii apeksha kai sau gune lambey or chaude hote hai
 For this reason, they are called Mahagunasutra
 inaki sanrachana saadhaaran samasutran or ardhasuthran centresutron se kuch bhinn dikhaai padati he
 Here, instead of one chromosome, a transverse line consists of granules that have more ability to stain
 gunasutra ke ek chor se duusare tak bahut si aisi anuprastha pankti kii sab kanikas ek samaan hoti hai or anya panktiyon kii kanikaon main visheshtaayen or vibhinnataayen hoti he
 As these chromosomes are very long, it is believed that they are completely desensitized and perhaps there is some elongation of the protein
 adhik chaude hone ke kaaran yah he ki ek gunasutra apane samaan ek duusare cendrak-tra kaa sanshleshan karata he
 At the time of samasutraana in ordinary state, these two sutras separate from each other, but in the Mahagunasutra it does not
 donon sutara ek duusare se jude hi rah jate hai
 The number of the Mahagunasutra is half that of the ordinary chromosome, as each sutra is paired with another sutra like it
 is ghatana ko daihik yugman kehete hai
 Another odd chromosome is also found in animals
 isak lampbrush gunasutra kehete hai
 These chromosomes are found in the nuclei of the eggs of animals that have high amounts of eggs, such as fish, amphibians, eggs, birds etc
 gunasutra saadhaaran diplotine-dyakinisis gunasutron ke samaan do do yugmit sutron ke bane hote hai
 Both paired sutras are connected to each other in some places and are far away from each other in other places
 in jodon ko kiesma samajha jaataa he
 On each sutra, which is called chromonima, there are granules of different lamination in place, which are called chromimiers
 prayek chromomier se ek jodi yaa adhik parshvapash jude hue hote he
 The lateral side is also made of a formula similar to chromonema, but the ribonucleo-protein corpuscles are gathered around it, making these formulas appear thick
 chromomier bhi chromonima se santat hote hai
 The nuclei are produced on a particular chromosome
 adhikansh jantuon kii prayek koshika main gunasutron ke do ekatm kulak hote hai
 a clan remains in the mature larynx
 aise praani or koshikaaye dwiganit kahi jaati hai, parantu kuch praaniyon, visheshat: paudhon, main do se adhik kulak gunasutron ke hote hai yah bahugunit kahe jate hai
 If the centrosome of a diploid animal is doubled, so that each of the sutras in its cells is like four, then such a creature is called an autopolyploid
 yadi kisi dwiguneet sankar ke gunasutra dugune ho jaae to aise praani ko allopoliploid kehete hai
 If a diploid animal, whose centrosomes are K1a1b1b1c1c1, etc
, is hybridized to another animal, whose chromosomes are K2a2b2b2c2c2, etc
, then its offspring will have chromosome A1a2b1b2c1c2 etc
 k1 k2 kha1 kha2 ityadi ek duusare se bhinn honge or inamen saadhaarant: yugman nahin hoga
 If the chromosomes of this creature are doubled, then in their cells A1a1a2a2; b 1 b 1 b 2 b 2; C1 c1 c2 c2, etc
 will have chromosomes
 yah allopoliploid kaha jayega
 Polyploids may also have more than four kulaks
 yah spasht he ki autopoliploid main zaigotin avasthaa main chatu:sanyojak utpann ho jaayange, kyonki prayek prakaar ke chaar chaar gunasutra upasthit hai or chaar sutron ke yugman se ek chatu:sanyojak banataa he
 At the time of cell division each pole will not get equal number of chromosomes
 praaia: aisa hota he ki ek chatu:sanyojak ke tuutane se kisi dhruv par teen sutara pahunche or uske sanmukh dhruv par ek hi sutara pahunche
 The offspring cells formed at the end of cell division will either have more chromosomes or fewer, and such imbalance results in the cell's death
 isi kaaran autotetraploid bahut kam urvar hote hai
 Autotetraploid plants are much larger than ordinary diploid plants and their seeds are also very large, so that they can prove more beneficial for the householder even when fertility is low
 thandhak pahunchaakar, yaa kuch alkelidon ke prabhaav se, paudhe atopoliplide banaae ja sakate hai
 The conditions are opposite in allotetraploids
 yadi donon aadim matapita ke sutara ek duusare se purna rup se vibhinn hon to allopoliplide kriyaatmak rup se dwiguneet he or purna rup se urvar hoga
 For example, if the formulas in a hybrid are completely different from those of K1a2, B1b2, C1c2, then such a hybrid will be sterile, but this state will be changed by doubling its chromosomes
 aisi koshikaon main k1 k1 k2 k2, kha1 kha1 kha2 kha2, ga1 ga1 ga2 ga2 ityadi sutara honge or jin shakhaon main aisi koshikaaye hongi unpar phool lagenge, kyonki aisi koshikaon main miotic vibhaajan safal hoga, k1 k1 se yugmit hoga, kha1 kha1 se ityadi
 The dhatura stramonium has 12 pairs of chromosomes in the diploid state and becomes bivalent at the time of meiosis
 iske autopoliploid main 12 chatushk gunasutra hote he or ardhasuthran ke samay 12 chatu:sanyojak banate hai
 Similarly, the plant diploid from Primula sinensis has 12 pairs of chromosomes and the autotetraploid has 48 formulas and at the time of meiosis it has 9 to 11 quadruple connectives and 2 to 6 are divalent
 solemon likopersicon ke dwiguneet main 12 jodi gunasutra hote hai or uske autotetraploid main 12 chatushk gunasutra
 These are all plants
 kripis rubra aura kripis foetida main 5 jodi gunasutra hote hai
 Their formulas do not differ much from each other and in hybrids resulting from their hybridization, 5 bisects are formed at the time of meiosis
 iske allopoliploid main 20 ken drakasutra hote hai or ardhasuthran main 0 se 5 chatu:sanyojak banate hai or 0 se 10 dwisanyojak
 It is clear that allotetraploids will not be very fertile
 primmula floribanda or primmula resticileta donon main hi 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai, jo ek duusare ke praaia: samaan hote hai
 The hybrids that they make from their hybridization are known as primateza kivensis
 isamen bhi 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai
 At the time of meiosis, the coupling is successful and 9 bisectors are formed
 sutron ke dvigun hone se jo allopoliplide banataa he usamen 9 chatushk sutara hote hai or aise paudhe main 12 se 18 tak dwisanyojak banate hai or 0 se 3 tak chatu:sanyojak
 It is clear that the number of quadrilateral is very small and sometimes not a single quadrant is formed
 muuli or karamkalla main se prayek main 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai, jo ek duusare se purnat: bhinn hote hai
 The hybrid Raphanus brassicae resulting from their hybridization also has 9 pair of chromosomes; But in meiosis, a single bisector is not formed, because the coupling action is not successful and all the formulas remain unpaired, making 12 unicellular
 iske sutara dvigun se utpann elotetraploid main 12 jodi sutara hote hai or ardhasuthran main 12 sanyojak banate hai, chatu:sanyojak ek bhi nahin
 The result is that raphanus-brassica-allatetraploid is very fertile, although raphanus-brassica-diploid is sterile
 jantuon main poliploidi bahut kam pai jaati he par yah anishekajanit jantuon main bahudhaa pai jaati he
 Many new species in plants may have arisen due to polyploidy
 iskaa pramaan isse miltaa he ki angiousparmon kii lagbhag aadhi jatiyaan aisi he jinke paripakv yugmakon ke gunasutron kii sankhya kisi sambandhit jati ke yugmakeey gunasutra kii sankhya kii guneet he
 There are many varieties of wheat
 in jatiyon kii mul yugmakeey cendraksutra sankhya 7 he
 The number of chromosomes is found to be 14, 21,42 and 49 multiplied by 7 among the wheat species
 isi bhanti tambaakoo kii bhinn bhinn jatiyon main gunasutron kii sankhya 12 athwa 12 kii guneet 24 hoti he
 Many polyploids have been formed by use in plants, which have two clusters of unitary formulas
 ye urvar hote hai
 There is no doubt that cytoplasm functions under the control of the nucleus
 anek prakaar ke koshikasmooh anyaanya kaaryon ke sanchaalan main lage rahete hai
 For example, the exocrine cells of the pancreas produce special digestive enzymes
 gud kii nalika kii koshikaaye rudhir se uria nikaal leti hai or yakrut kii koshikaaye glucose ko glikojan main parinat karke ekmit kar leti hai
 It is clear that in every cell of any creature, all its genes are normally present
 isaliye bhinn bhinn prakaar kii koshikaon ke vividh prakaar ke proteinon kii utpatti main kuch upyukt jin to sakriy rahe honge or shesh sab niskriy ho gaye honge ore unki sakriyata ke sambandh main bhi yahi baat hoti hogi

 Nevertheless, the term relativity or relativity is sometimes used to refer to Galilean invariance
 theory off relativity naamak is shabd kaa prayog sabase pehle san 1906 main maiks plank ne kiya tha
 It was derived from the English term group "relative Theory" which describes how this theory uses the Principles of Relativity
 isi paper ke charchaa sambhag main alfred bukarar ne pratham baar "theory of relativity" kaa prayog kiya tha
 The relativity principle is in essence that the existence of 'absolute' speed and 'absolute' acceleration is impossible, that is, the terms 'absolute speed' and 'absolute acceleration' are virtually meaningless
 yadi 'nirpeksh gati' kaa arth hota to vah anya pindo kii charchaa kiye bina hi nishchit ho sakati
 But even after trying all the ways, the 'absolute' motion of a body has not been definitively proved by experiment and now the theory of relativity suggests that it is impossible to determine it
 aapekshikta siddhant se bhautikee main ek nae drushtikon kaa prarambh hua
 With the advent of relativity theory, some old theories of physics were firmly fixed and there was a need to think more closely about many fundamental imaginations
 vigyaan main siddhant kaa kaary praaia: gyaat falon ko vyavasthit rup se sutrit karnaa hota he or uske baad us siddhant se nae falon kaa anumaan karke prayog dwaara un falon kii pariksha kii jaati he
 Relativity theory has been successful in both these works
 19veen shatabdi ke ant tak bhautikee kaa vikaas newton pranit siddhanton ke anusaar ho rahaa tha
 Every new invention or experimental fruit was seen from the point of view of these principles and necessary new hypotheses were made
 inamen sarvyaapee ether kaa ek vishisht sthaan tha
 There were two major reasons for imagining the existence of ether
 pratham to vidyutchumbakeey tarangon ke kampan kaa ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak prasaran hone ke liye ether jaise madhyam kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Second, Newton's kinetic equations in mechanics, and also the background on which these equations were based, required an authentic director
 prayogon ke falon kaa yatharth akalan hone ke liye ether par vishisht gundharmon kaa aropan kiya jaataa tha
 Ether was considered ubiquitous and believed to exist in all directions and bodies
 is sthir ether main pind bina pratirodh ke bhraman kar sakate hai, aisi kalpana thi
 Due to these properties, there was no obstacle in understanding ether as an absolute standard
 prakaash kii gati 3x108 me
 prati second he, yah gyaat hua tha or prakaash kii tarangen 'sthir' ether ke saapeksh is gati se vikirit hoti hai, aisi kalpana thi
 In mechanics, ether was also considered an absolute standard for velocity, acceleration, force, etc
 19veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main ether kaa astitv tathaa uske gundharm sthapit karne ke anek praytn prayog dwaara kiye gaye
 Among them, the use of Michelson Morley is particularly important and notable
 prithvi, surya kii parikrama ether ke saapeksh jis gati se karti he us gati kaa yatharth maapan karnaa is prayog kaa uddeshy tha
 But this attempt was unsuccessful and from the result of the experiment it was estimated that the speed of the earth with respect to ether is zero
 iskaa yah bhi arth hua ki ether kii kalpana asaty he, arthath ether kaa astitv hi nahin he
 If there is no ether then even absolute standards cannot exist
 at: gati keval saapeksh hi ho sakati he
 In physics, work is usually done by directing any one method to measure the speed or to express the result
 kintu in nirdeshak paddatiyon main koi bhi paddati 'vishistaaapurna' nahin ho sakati, kyonki yadi aisa hota to us 'vishistaaapurna' nirdeshak paddati ko ham vishranti kaa maanak samaj sakate
 a similar result was obtained from many experiments
 in prayogon ke falon se keval bhautikee main hi nahin, balki vigyaan tathaa darshan main bhi gambhir ashaanti utpann hui
 In the early 20th century, the famous French mathematician H
 Poincaré presented the rule of relativity
 inke anusaar bhautikee ke niyam aise swaroop main vyakt hone chahie ki ve kisi bhi prekshak ke liye vaastavik hon
 This means that the laws of physics should not be observable above the speed of the observer
 is pranium se dik tathaa kaal kii prachlit dharanaon par nayaa prakaash padaa
 Einstein's ideology on this subject, though revolutionary, was more successful in explaining the fruits of experiments
 oinstin ne gati, twaran, dik, kaal ityadi moulik shabdon kaa or unase sanyukt prachlit dharanaon kaa vishesh vishleshan kiya
 From this analysis, it became clear that there are errors in physics based and distinguished by Newton's theories
 oinstin pranit aapekshikta siddhant ke do vibhaag hai : In specific relativity theory the laws of physics are expressed in the form that they will be the same for any observant observer
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is prakaar vyakt hote hai ki ve prekshak kii gati se swatantra yaa abaadhit honge
 The specific relativity theory developed in 1905 and the general relational theory developed in 1915
 iskaa pratipaadan san 1905 main oinstin ne apane ek shodhpatr on da electrodinemics off mowing bodies main kii thi
 Specific relativity is based on two hypotheses that contradict the concepts of classical mechanics: vishisht aapekshikta ke siddhanth se nikalne vaale parinaam ascharyajanak hai; inamen se kuch is prakaar hai: In classical mechanics Galileo's transformation is used while Lorents transformation in specific relativity
 san 1907 se 1911 ke bich ainstin dwaara viksit aapekshikta siddhanth hi 'saamaanya aapekshikta' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 This theory is based on the following two hypotheses: lambaai, dik, kaal, dravyaman, urja ityadi ke vishay main bhotiki main jo dharanaayen thim unamem vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ne sudhaar kiya
 Apart from these, there are other subjects in the field of physics which are equally important, but their inclusion is not in the specific relativity theory
 bal tathaa vidyutchumbakeey kshetron main vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa jaisaa upyog ho saktaa he vaisaa gurutveey kshetra main nahin ho saktaa
 Gravity is an extremely important department of physics, so it is clear that there is a need to broaden the specific relativity theory
 dravyaman kaa sambandh bhautikee main do prakaar se aata he
 When a force acts on a body, the body's position changes and its velocity changes
 jab tak bal kaary karata he tab tak pind ko twaran miltaa he
 According to the laws of mechanics the force, mass and acceleration of the body have the following relation: is sameekaran main jo dravyaman m he usko jadtv yaa ashrith dravyaman kehete hai
 The second relation of mass comes under the gravitational field of Newton
 newton dwaara diye gayi gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke anusaar yadi do dravyaman, m1 tathaa m2, duuri r par hon, to unke bich main nimnlikhit gurutvkarshneey bal f kaam karegaa : g is the gravitational constant in this equation
 yadi ham m1 ko prithvi kaa dravyaman samajhen or m2 ko dharti ke paas sthit kisi anya pind kaa dravyaman samajhen to sameekaran dravyaman m2 kaa bhaar vyakt karegaa
 In Newton's mechanics, kinetics and gravity are independent and different, but both have a relationship of mass
 dravyaman ke in do swatantra tathaa bhinn vibhaagon main prayukt kalpanaaon kaa ekikaran oinstin ne apane saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main kiya
 It was known that inertial mass and gravitational mass are the same
 oinstin ne dravyaman kii is samanta kaa upyog karke gativigyaan or gurutvkarshan ko ekarup kiya or san 1915 i
 main vyapak aapekshikta siddhant prastut kiya
 The method of formulating general relativity theory in mathematics is different from other methods
 isamen vishesh jyamiti kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jo euclid kii tri-aiami jyamiti se bhinn he
 ] Stated that in the specific relativity theory, if the three dimensions of difficulty and the fourth dimension of time, a 'chatrayayam Satti' with these four dimensions, is imagined, then the theory of relativity becomes much simpler
 samakshanikta, nirpeksh nahin he - yah pramanit kiya ja chukaa he
 This eliminates the Newton-posed problem and the absolute and freedom of time
 at: bhautik ghatana vyakt karne ke liye dik tathaa samay kii chaturaayam satati adhik swaabhaavik he
 Einstein made more use of what Reiman had developed for his geometry by imagining 'chatrayayam Dikha'
 dik tathaa samay kii is chaturaayam satati main bhautikee ke siddhant jyamitiya rup se saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main rakhe gaye
 This Chatrayayam Satti is equated with the problem of Euclid's three dimensions
 teen aayam kii satati main, in teen nirdeshaankon se jis prakaar bindu athwa ek sthaan nishchit hota he, vaise hi do bindu or ke bich kii lambaai bhi nishchit hoti he
 When time is added along these three dimensions of the problem in Chatrayayam Sati, then the dimension of time comes as t = x0
5c-1, where t = time and c = velocity of light
 ek prekshak ke liye ek vishwaghatana ke nirdenshank hon to us prekshak ke saapeksh gatiman duusare prekshak ke liye usee ghatana ke nirdeshank honge
 If the laws of Lorenz's conversion are true, it can be proved that sameekaran kaa vikaas karke kisi bhi prakaar kii gati ke liye isi prakaar kii kintu atyadhik sanmishra padasanhtiyaan milti hai
 For this, the principles of principles and principles are required
 moulik kalpanaaon kaa is reeti se vistaar karne par vyapak aapekshikta siddhant main gurutvkarshan swabhaavat: aata he
 It does not require specific hypotheses
 anek ghatnaon ke fal, oinstin pranit vyapak aapekshikta siddhant ke anusaar tathaa newton pranit pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar, samaan hi hote hai
 But when the general relativity principle was used in astronomy, the results of the three phenomena differed somewhat from those produced according to the iconic mechanics

 There has been an attempt to explain crime since ages

 It is therefore difficult to explain
 purvi tathaa pashchimi deshon ke praarambhik vidhaanon ke naitik, dharmik tathaa saamaajik niyamon kaa todna samaan rup se aparaadh tha
 Sargent Santiphan has written that it is a crime to act contrary to what the majority of the community thinks is right
 bladeston kehete hai ki samue samudaay ke prati kartavya he tathaa uske jo adhikaar hai unki avagya aparaadh kaa nirnay nagar kii samoochee janata karti thi
 In today's law, crime is considered the object of 'public harm'
 do sau varsh purv tak sansar ke sabhi deshon kii yah nishcitt niti thi ki jisane samaaj ke adeshon kii avagya kii he, usase badla lenaa chahie
 That is why the criminal was tortured a lot
 jelon main uske saath pashu se bhi bura vyavhaar hota tha
 This feeling has changed now
 aaj samaaj kii nishchit dharna he ki aparaadh, shaareerik tathaa maansik donon prakaar kaa rog he, isliye apradhi kii chikitsa kerani chahie
 It has to be returned by making a decent, civilized, moral citizen while returning to society
 atev karagaar yatnaa ke liye nahin, sudhaar ke liye he
 It became clear that if crime is the name of defiance of moral and social orders, then the word cannot be given any definite meaning
 frid varg ke viddhan prayek aparaadh ko kamvasana kaa parinaam batalaate he tathaa hili jaise shastri use saamaajik vaataavaran kaa parinaam kehete hai, kintu ye donon mat maanya nahin he
 There is not a single type of religion in a country
 har ek main ek hi prakaar kaa saamaajik sanghathan bhi nahin he, rahan sahan main bhed he, aachaar vichaar main bhed he, aisi sthiti main ek desh kaa aparaadh duusare desh main sarvatha uchit aachaar ban saktaa he
 Somewhere it is a valid thing to divorce a woman, elsewhere it is completely forbidden

 sanyukt rashtrasang ne bhi aparaagh kii vyakhya karne kii cheshtaa kii he or usne bhi keval 'asaamaajik' athwa 'samajavirohi' kaaryon ko aparaadh sweekaar kiya he
 But this cannot create a worldwide moral and crime related legislation

 Dr
 Lambrozo of Italy was the first scribe who tried to identify the 'criminal' rather than the crime
 pheri samaajavigyaan dwaara aparaadh ho, chaahe koi bhi kare, kisi bhi paristhiti main kare, uskaa or koi kaaran nahin, keval yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki vyaktigat swatantra ichha se kiya gaya he yaa prakritik yaa swaabhaavik kaarnon kaa parinnam he
 Garofalo considered crime a matter of psychology: according to him, there are four types of criminals - murderers, violent criminals, criminals against property, and criminals of lust
 garophalo ke mat se prandand, aajanm karagaar yaa deshnikala, ye hi teen sajaayen honi chahie
 Fon Haamel raised the discussion of criminal reform for the first time

 According to him, man is just a set of his consciousness and conscience

 France's state revolution declared 'human rights'
 apradhi bhi manushya hai
 He too has some natural rights
 isliye apradhi aparaadh kii vyakhya chaahate he
 The most obvious interpretation of this was given by the French Penal Code of 1934
 aparaadh vahi he jise kanuunan manaa kiya gaya ho
 The thing which is denied in the then environment is the crime
 kintu, kanuunan nazaij kaam karnaa hi aparaadh nahin rah gaya he
 The point which Dr
 Gutner had raised has become a great subject for every court today
 vahi aparaagh he
 If while flying a kite on the roof, a stone comes down on the road from a boy's foot and falls on the head of another person, then that boy is not guilty of murder
 atev mahatv kii vastu niyat he
 Real justice can only be done by mixing the crime and its intention to commit it
 kintu samajashaastra ke panditonke saamne yah samasya bhi thi or he ki samaaj kii haani karanevaal ke saath vyavhaar kaisaa ho
 Aflatoon was of the opinion that it is unfair to harm the harm
 prasiddh samaaj-shastri jivik ne spasht kaha tha ki nyaay kabhi nahin chahta ki bhul karanevaal yani aparaadh karanwane ko pidaa pahunchaai jaae
 Lord Haldane also advised not to consider crime, but to consider the criminal, his problems, his environment
 britain ke prasiddh raajnneetijna tathaa kai baar praghan mantri bananevaale winston churchill kaa kathan he ki aparaadh tathaa apradhi ke prati janata kii kisi bhaavana tathaa drushti he, usee se us desh kii sabhyataa kaa vaastavik anumaan lag saktaa he
 British law considers the same act to be a crime that is done ill-favorably, voluntarily, cunningly, done, allowed or allowed
 bahut se aparaadh aise hote hai jo aparaadh hone ke karan hi aparaadh nahin samajhe jate
 For example, gene type marriages are illegal in the UK, so even if married, it would not be considered a marriage, such as marrying a girl under 16, etc
 naveen audyogic sabhyataa main aparaadh kaa rup tathaa prakaar bhi badal gaya he
 New types of crimes have started happening which are difficult to imagine
 isliye aparaadh kii pahchaan ab is samay yahi he ki kanoon ne jis kaam ko manaa kiya he, vah aparaadh he
 The one who has done the forbidden work is the culprit
 kintu, apradhi paristhiti kaa das ho saktaa he, vivash ho saktaa he, isliye use pahchaanane kaa praytn karnaa hoga
 Today's criminology does not believe that someone has become a worshiper by learning from the stomach or someone is deliberately making it his 'life'
 har ek aparaadh kaa tathaa har ek apradhi kaa adhyayan hona chahie
 That is why every crime and every criminal has become the subject of personal study, personal diagnosis and personal medicine

 a person whose childhood does not pass in an atmosphere of love and encouragement, many types of mental glands of inferiority are formed in his mind
 in grathiyon main uski man main uski bahut si maansik shakti sanchit rahati he
 Dr
 Alfred Adler states that a person who has mental glands of inferiority in his mind inevitably commits many kinds of crimes
 yah aparaadh vah isliye karata he ki swayan ko vah duusare logon se adhik balavaan siddh kar sake
 The gland of inferiority remains in the mind in this person, he is always in a state of inner mental dissatisfaction
 vah sab samay aise kaamon main apane ko lagaae rahata he jisase sabhi log uski ore dekhen or uski prashansa kare
 The mental gland of inferiority puts man in such works, due to which the human being has to hear many kinds of condemnation
 es vyakti swayan ko sadaa charchaa kaa vishay banaae rakhana chahta he
 If it is not discussed for good works then it should be for bad works

 She always inspires him to do special work
 yadi aise vyakti ko dand kiya jaae to isse uskaa sudhaar nahin hota, apitu isse uski maansik granthi or bhi jatil ho jaati he
 The treatment of such a criminal requires a mental doctor
 aadhunik manovigyaan ne hamen bataaya he ki samaaj main aparaadh ko kam karne ke liye dandvidhaan ko kadaa karnaa paryaapt nahin he
 For this education is required in the society
 jab manushya kii koi pravriti bachapan se hi prabal ho jaati he to aage chalkaar vah vishesh prakaar ke kaaryo main prakashit hoti he
 These works are beneficial for the society or are anti-social

 The higher the state of self-control, the less the crime
 samaaj main bahut se log apane vivek se pratikul aparaadh karte hai
 What is the reason for this? According to the discoveries of modern psychology, the childhood of such people would not have passed properly
 ye log buddhi main to janm se hi praveen the atev ye anek prakaar ke vichaaron ko jaan sake
 But they did not have such permanent feelings in their mind in their childhood so that they can stop themselves from doing inappropriate work
 ye sthaayee bhav jab tak manushya ke swabhaav ke ang nahin ban jate tab tak ve manushya ko duraachaar se rokane kii kshamta nahin dete
 Such scholars commit crimes and even curse themselves for them

 When a person starts to see his own interest in the interest of others and gets the ability to conduct according to this idea, then only he is a qualified citizen of the society
 aisa vyakti jab kuch karata he, vah samaaj ke hit ke liye hi hota he
 Crime is a type of social asymmetry
 yah vyaktigat maansik vishmata kaa parinaam he
 This type of asymmetry starts in childhood

 is available
 isi ke anusaar hindu dharamshastron main saamaanya rup se 32 prakaar ke aparaadh bataae gaye hai
 The number of them can also be more because the nature of these crimes also varies according to the variation of country, time and society
 isliye bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke vichaar vyakt karte dikhaai padate hai
 Hindu theology or memoir appears to express different views regarding crimes and their punishments

 In considering the crime from a mental point of view, Lambrozo had said long ago that the body of a criminal has a special shape

 It is also known as the Second War of Kashmir
 bharat or pakistan ke bich jammu or kashmir rajya par adhikaar ke liye bantwaare ke samay se hi vivaad chal rahaa he
 In 1947, the first war between India and Pakistan was also fought for Kashmir
 is ladaai kii shuruuaat pakistan ne apane sainikon ko ghuspaithiyon ke rup main bhej kar is ummid main kii thi ki kashmir kii janata bharat ke khilaaf vidroh kar degi
 This campaign was named by Pakistan as Yudhbhiyan Gibraltar

 The war ended with the United Nations declaring a ceasefire and an agreement on both sides in Tashkent

 Before the Kargil War, there was never such a large military gathering in Kashmir

 Like many wars between the two sides, both sides did not reveal many details of this war
 bharat or pakistan ke 1947 main hue batwaare ke samay se hi bharat or pakistan ke bich kai muddo par tanatani chal rahi thi haalanki jammu or kashmir kaa mudda isame sabase bada tha par anya seemaa vivaad bhi the iname sabase pramukh kuccha kaa ran, jo ki ek banjar ilaaka he, ke batwaare par tha
 On 20 March 1965, Pakistan deliberately started skirmishes in the Rann of Kutch

 This court gave about 900 square kilometers of the Kutch run to Pakistan

 India had lost the war with China at that time and they believed that India was not in a position to wage war at that time

 At last General Ayub Khan came under pressure and ordered the covert operation of Operation Gibraltar
 is abhiyaan kaa mukhya uddeshy kashmir kii janata main vidroh bhadakaana or bhartiya sanchartantr evam parivahan vyavastha ko nuksaan pahuchana tha
 The infiltrators of Pakistan were quickly identified and instead of rebelling, the public informed the Indian soldiers and the operation completely failed

 The Indian Army, after receiving information from the local population, crossed the Line of Control on 15 August
 
 In the beginning, the Indian Army had good success

 Pakistan made significant progress in the Tithwal, Uri and Poonch regions, but on August 18, the strength of the Pakistani campaign had decreased significantly

 With this occupation Pakistan came into being

 Not only this, Pakistan's command felt that Muzaffarabad, the important city of Pakistani Kashmir, is now going to be captured by Indians
 mujaffarabad par dabaav kam karne ke liye pakistan ne ek nayaa abhiyaan oparation grand slam shuru kiya
 On 1 September 1965, Pakistan, under an operation called Grand Slam, attacked the strategic city of Akhnoor, Jammu and Kashmir, from a strategic drift
 is abhiyaan kaa uddeshy kashmir ghati kaa shesh bharat se sampark tod tha taaki uski rasad or sanchaar vayvastha bhang kar di jaay
 India was not ready for this invasion of Pakistan and Pakistan was getting the benefit of large number of soldiers and better type of tanks
 shuruwat main bharat ko baari kshati uthaani padi is par bhartiya sena ne hawaii hamale kaa upyog kiya iske jawaab main pakistan ne punjab or srinagar ke hawaii thikaano par hamalaa kar diya
 Pakistan was in a very good position during this phase of the war and this unexpected attack caused panic in the Indian camp
 akhnur ke pakistani sena ke haath main jane se bharat ke liye kashmir ghati mehar kaa khatra paidaa ho saktaa tha
 There were two reasons for the failure of the Grand Slam
 The first and the biggest reason was that Pakistan's military command changed its military commander at the mouth of the victory, in such a way, the Pakistani army was delayed by a day and those 24 In the hour, India got an opportunity to bring additional troops and goods to protect Akhnoor
 Local commanders of the Indian Army themselves were aghast why Pakistan gave up such an easy victory
 Used to be

 General Chaudhary did not agree with this, but the then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shashtri ignored the matter and ordered the attack
 bharat ne 6 sitambar ko antarrashtriya seemaa rekha ko paar kar pashchimi morche par hamalaa kar yuddh kii aadhikarik shuruwat kar di
 On September 6, India's 15th infantry unit faced a major Pakistani attack on the western side of the Ichogil Canal under the leadership of Major General Prasad, a World War II veteran

 Major General Prasad's convoy was also attacked in this attack and had to leave his vehicle and run away

 This led the Indian Army to attack Lahore air base and as a result the US appealed for a temporary ceasefire to evacuate its citizens from Lahore
 isi bich pakistan ne lahore par dabaav ko kam karne ke liye khemkaran par hamalaa kar us par kabja kar liya badale main bharat ne bediyaan or uske aas paas ke gaavon par hamalaa kar diya
 The attack on Lahore on 6 September included the first infantry division of the Indian Army along with three tank squads of the second armored subdivision

 The big officers of the Indian Army did not know the ground situation properly, so they ordered the 3 Jats to retreat, fearing that the 3 Jats had also suffered heavy losses, this caused a lot of disappointment to the command officer of the 3 Jats and later on Dograi Then there was a huge cost to capture
 8 disambar 1965 ko 5 maratha lit infentry kaa ek dasta ranneetik rup se mahatvapurn kasbe munaabaav main tainaat rajasthan sainya bal kly majbootee pradaan karne ke liye bheja gaya
 They were ordered to stop the Pakistani army from advancing but they could only protect their outpost amidst heavy bombardment by the artillery of the Pakistani army and aerial and infantry offensive, 5 Maratha soldiers showed great valor
 As a result, today that outpost is known as Maratha Hill

 The events after 9 September crushed the proud pride of the armies of both the countries

 Pakistan's relatively weak 6 armored division in Chhavinda was defeated badly
 The Indian Army lost about 100 tanks and was forced to retreat

 For their final offensive, Pakistan along with its 1st Armored Division and 11th Infantry Division attacked Khemkaran with the intention of occupying Amritsar

 The Pakistani Army moved ahead of Khemkaran as India's fourth mountain division, 7 Mountain Brigade, 62 Mountain Brigade, Deccan Horse, equipped with Sherman tanks, stood for battle with their other division

 The Indian Air Force had a large number of Hawker Hunters, Faland Nate, De Havilland Vampires, EE Canberra bombers and a squadron of mig-21s built in India
 pakistani vaayu sena ke fadter plane the- 102 F-86F saibar or 12 F-104 starfiter, or 24 B-57 canberra bamavarshak
 The ratio of India and Pakistan Air Forces during the conflict was 5: 1

 According to Air Commander Sajjad Haider, who led Pakistan's No
 19 Squadron in the war - although the Indian Air Force vampire fighter aircraft were older and weaker than the F-86 Saber, Hunter aircraft were superior to them both in strength and speed
 bharatiyon ke anusaar F-86 chote se folland nait ke saamne kamazor tha jiske kaaran in vimaanon ko "saibar naashak" kaha jane laga tha
 The Pakistan Air Force's F-104 Starfighter was the fastest flying fighter aircraft in the subcontinent at the time and was often called the "pride of the Pakistan Air Force"

 Therefore, they were not suitable for the atmosphere of that time

 Yet with the supersonic pace in the feud battle between Saber and Nats, Saber was far more successful

 The Pakistani Air Force claimed that it dropped 104 aircraft from India and lost 19 of its aircraft, while the Indian Air Force claimed that it dropped 73 aircraft from Pakistan and lost 35 of its aircraft

 Pakistan sources have denied claims of losing only one squadron of the Pakistan Air Force, stating that Pakistan had sought additional aircraft from Indonesia, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and China within 10 days of the initial war
 swatantra sutron ke anusaar, pieef ne kuch 20 vimaan kho die the jabaki bharatiyon ne 60-75 vimaan kho diye the
 Pakistan lost 17 percent of its front-line strength by the end of the war, while India's losses were less than 10 percent

 In the 1965 war, the largest wars of tanks were fought after World War II
 
 At the beginning of the war, the Pakistani Army had both a numerical advantage in tanks, as well as better equipment overall
 Pakistani armour was largely American-made; it consisted mainly of Patton M-47 and M-48 tanks, but also included many M4 Sherman tanks, some M24 Chaffee light tanks and M36 Jackson tank destroyers, equipped with 90 mm guns
 The bulk of India's tank fleet were older M4 Sherman tanks; some were up-gunned with the French high velocity CN 75 50 guns and could hold their own, whilst some older models were still equipped with the inferior 75 mm M3 l / 40 gun
 Besides the M4 tanks, bharat fielded the British-made Centurion Tank Mk 7, with the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, and the AMX-13, PT-76, and M3 Stuart light tanks
 Pakistan fielded a greater number and more modern artillery; its guns out-ranged those of the Indian artillery, according to Pakistan's Major General T
H
 Malik
 At the outbreak of war in 1965, Pakistan had about 15 armored cavalry regiments, each with about 45 tanks in three squadrons
 Besides the Pattons, there were about 200 M4 Shermans re-armed with 76 mm guns, 150 M24 Chaffee light tank and a few independent squadrons of M36B1 tank destroyers
 Most of these regiments served in Pakistan's two armored divisions, the 1st and 6th armored divisions - the latter being in the process of formation
 The Indian Army of the time possessed 17 cavalry regiments, and in the 1950s had begun modernizing them by the acquisition of 164 AMX-13 light tanks and 188 Centurions
 The remainder of the cavalry units were equipped with M4 Shermans and a small number of M3A3 Stuart light tanks
 India had only a single armoured division, the 1st 'black Elephant' Armoured Division, also called 'fakhr-i-hind', which consisted of the 17th Cavalry, the 4th Hodson's Horse, the 16th 'black Elephant' Cavalry, the 7th Light Cavalry, the 2nd Lancers, the 18th Cavalry and the 62nd Cavalry, the two first named being equipped with Centurions
 There was also the 2nd Independent Armoured Brigade, one of whose three regiments, the 3rd Cavalry, was also equipped with Centurions
 Despite the qualitative and numerical superiority of Pakistani armor, Pakistan was outfought on the battlefield by India, which made progress into the lahore-sialkot sector, whilst halting Pakistan's counteroffensive on Amritsar 
; They were sometimes employed in a faulty manner, such as charging prepared defenses during the defeat of Pakistan's 1st Armored Division at Assal Uttar
 Although India's tank formations experienced same results, bharat's attack at the Battle of Chawinda, led by its 1st Armored Division and supporting units, was brought to a grinding halt by the newly raised 6th Armoured Division in the Chawinda sector
 The Indians lost 120 tanks at Chawinda
 One true winner to emerge was India's Centurion battle tank, with its 105 mm gun and heavy armour, which proved superior to the overly complex Pattons and their exaggerated reputations
 However, in the Sialkot sector outnumbered Pattons performed exceedingly well in the hands of the 25th Cavalry and other regiments of the 6th Armoured Division, which exacted a disproportionately heavy toll of Centurions from the Poona Horse and Hodson's Horse
 The Indian Army has made much of the fact that some of its Centurions survived repeated hits; yet have failed to point out that the majority of tanks in the Sialkot sector were Shermans whose guns were inadequate even in 1944
 Neither the Indian nor Pakistani Army showed any great facility in the use of armoured formations in offensive operations, whether the Pakistani 1st Armoured Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armoured Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armoured Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes The navies of India and Pakistan did not play a prominent role in the war of 1965, although Pakistani accounts dispute this
 On September 7, a flotilla of the Pakistani Navy carried out a small scale bombardment of the Indian coastal town and radar station of Dwarka, which was 200 miles south of the Pakistani port of Karachi
 Codenamed Operation Dwarka, it did not fulfill its primary objective of disabling the radar station and there was no immediate retaliatory response from India
 Later, some of the Indian fleet sailed from Bombay to Dwarka to patrol the area and deter further bombardment
 Foreign authors have noted that the "insignificant bombardment" of the town was a "limited engagement, with no strategic value
" According to some Pakistani sources, one submarine, PNS Ghazi, kept the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant besieged in Bombay throughout the war
 Indian sources claim that it was not their intention to get into a naval conflict with Pakistan, and wished to restrict the war to a land-based conflict
 Moreover, they note that the Vikrant was in dry dock in the process of refitting
 Some Pakistani defence writers have also discounted claims that the Indian Navy was bottled up in Bombay by a single submarine, instead stating that 75% of the Indian Navy was under maintenance in harbour
 The Pakistan Army launched a number of covert operations to infiltrate and sabotage Indian airbases
 On September 7, 1965, the Special Services Group commandos were parachuted into enemy territory
 According to Chief of Army Staff General Musa Khan, about 135 commandos were airdropped at three Indian airfields
 The daring attempt proved to be an "unmitigated disaster"
 Only 22 commandos returned to Pakistan as planned, 93 were taken prisoner, and 20 were killed in encounters with the army, police or civilians the reason for the failure of the commando mission is attributed to the failure to provide maps, proper briefings and adequate planning or preparation Despite failing to sabotage the airfields, Pakistan sources claim that the commando mission affected some planned Indian operations
 As the Indian 14th Infantry Division was diverted to hunt for paratroopers, the Pakistan Air Force found the road filled with transport, and destroyed many vehicles
 India responded to the covert activity by announcing rewards for captured Pakistani spies or paratroopers
 Meanwhile, in Pakistan, rumors spread that India had retaliated with its own covert operations, sending commandos deep into Pakistan territory, but these rumors were later determined to be unfounded
 apni or duusare kii haani ke bare main bharat or pakistan donon ne bilkul bemail daawey kiye
 The brief table of claims of the two countries is as follows There have been several neutral assessments of the losses incurred by both India and Pakistan during the war
 Most of these assessments agree that India had a upper hand over Pakistan when ceasefire was declared
 Some of the neutral assessments are mentioned below — The war was militarily inconclusive; Each side held prisoners and some territory belonging to the other
 Losses were relatively heavy — on the Pakistani side, twenty aircraft, 200 tanks, and 3,800 troops
 Pakistan's army had been able to withstand Indian pressure, but a continuation of the fighting would only have led to further losses and ultimate defeat for Pakistan
 Most Pakistanis, schooled in the belief of their own martial prowess, refused to accept the possibility of their country's military defeat by "hindu India" and were, instead, quick to blame their failure to attain their military aims on what they considered to be the ineptitude of Ayub Khan and his government
 Severely mauled by the larger Indian armed forces, Pakistan could continue the fight only by teaming up with Red China and turning its back on the U
N
 The invading Indian forces outfought their Pakistani counterparts and halted their attack on the outskirts of Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city
 By the time United Nations intervened on September 22, Pakistan had suffered a clear defeat
 The superior Indian forces, however, won a decisive victory and the army could have even marched on into Pakistani territory had external pressure not forced both combatants to cease their war efforts
 In three weeks the second indo-pak War ended in what appeared to be a draw when the embargo placed by Washington on US ammunition and replacements for both armies forced cessation of conflict before either side won a clear victory
 India, however, was in a position to inflict grave damage to, if not capture, Pakistan's capital of the Punjab when the cease-fire was called, and controlled Kashmir's strategic uri-poonch bulge, much to Ayub's chagrin
 India won the war
 It gained 1,840 square kilometers of Pakistani territory: 640 square kilometers in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan's portion of the state; 460 square kilometers of the Sailkot sector; 380 square kilometers far to the south of Sindh; and most critical, 360 square kilometers on the Lahore front
 Pakistan took 540 square kilometers of Indian territory: 490 square kilometers in the Chhamb sector and 50 square kilometers around Khem Karan
these are not correct pls review Although both sides lost heavily in men and material, and neither gained a decisive military advantage, India had the better of the war
 New Delhi achieved its basic goal of thwarting Pakistan's attempt to seize Kashmir by force
 Pakistan gained nothing from a conflict which it had instigated
 India's strategic aims were modest – it aimed to deny Pakistani Army victory, although it ended up in possession of 720 varg mile of Pakistani territory for the loss of just 220 varg mile of its own
 a brief but furious 1965 war with India began with a covert Pakistani thrust across the Kashmiri cease-fire line and ended up with the city of Lahore threatened with encirclement by Indian Army
 Another un-sponsored cease-fire left borders unchanged, but Pakistan's vulnerability had again been exposed
 The 1965 indo-pak war lasted barely a month
 Pakistan made gains in the Rajasthan desert but its main push against India's jammu-srinagar road link was repulsed and Indian tanks advanced to within a sight of Lahore
 Both sides claimed victory but India had most to celebrate
 Again India appeared, logistically at least, to be in a superior position but neither side was able to mobilize enough strength to gain a decisive victory
 By just the end of the week, in fact, it was clear that the Pakistanis were more than holding their own
 The United States and the Soviet Union used important diplomatic equipment to prevent further escalation in conflict between the two South Asian countries
 premier alexi kosiyan ke netritv main soviet sangh ne taashkand main yudhviram kii vaarta kii mejabani kii, jahaan bhartiya pradhan mantri laal bahadur shastri or pakistani raashtrapati ayub khan ne taashkand samjhaute par hastakshar kiye, 25 farvari 1966 ke baad se agast ke purv main senaayen waapas lene ke liye sahamat hue
 With declining stockpiles of ammunition, Pakistani leaders feared the war tilting in India's favor
 Therefore, they quickly accepted the ceasefire in Tashkent
 Despite strong opposition from Indian military leaders, India budged to growing international diplomatic pressure and accepted the ceasefire
 On September 22, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that called for an unconditional ceasefire from both nations
 The war ended the following day
 India's Prime Minister, Shastri, suffered a fatal heart attack soon after the declaration of the ceasefire
 As a consequence, the public outcry in India against the ceasefire declaration transformed into a wave of sympathy for the ruling Indian National Congress
 The ceasefire was criticized by many Pakistanis who, relying on fabricated official reports and the controlled Pakistani press, believed that the leadership had surrendered military gains
 The protests led to student riots
 Pakistan State's reports had suggested that their military was performing admirably in the war – which they incorrectly blamed as being initiated by India – and thus the Tashkent Declaration was seen as having forfeited the gains
 Some recent books written by Pakistani authors, including one by ex-isi chief titled "the Myth of 1965 Victory", allegedly exposed Pakistani fabrications about the war, but all copies of the book were bought by Pakistan Army to prevent publication because the topic was "too sensitive"
 India and Pakistan accused each other of ceasefire violations; India charged Pakistan with 585 violations in 34 days, while Pakistan countered with accusations of 450 incidents by India
 In addition to the expected exchange of small arms and artillery fire, India reported that Pakistan utilized the ceasefire to capture the Indian village of Chananwalla in the Fazilka sector
 This village was recaptured by Indian troops on 25 December
 On October 10, a B-57 Canberra on loan to the PAF was damaged by 3 SA-2 missiles fired from the IAF base at Ambala
 a Pakistani Army Auster was shot down on 16 December killing one Pakistani Army captain and on 2 February 1967, an AOP was shot down by IAF Hunters
 The ceasefire remained in effect until the start of the indo-pakistani War of 1971
 Due to many strategic mistakes made by both India and Pakistan, this war came to a disastrous situation
 Indian military intelligence gave no warning of the impending Pakistan invasion
 The Indian Army failed to recognize the presence of heavy Pakistani artillery and armaments in Chumb and suffered significant losses as a result
 The "official History of the 1965 War", drafted by the Ministry of Defense of India in 1992, was a long suppressed document that revealed other miscalculations
 According to the document, on September 22 when the Security Council was pressing for a ceasefire, the Indian Prime Minister asked commanding Gen
 Chaudhuri if India could possibly win the war, were he to delay accepting the ceasefire
 The general replied that most of India's frontline ammunition had been used up and the Indian Army had suffered considerable tank losses
 It was determined later that only 14% of India's frontline ammunition had been fired and India held twice the number of tanks as Pakistan
 By this time, the Pakistani Army had used close to 80% of its ammunition
 Air Chief Marshal P
C
 Lal, who was the Vice Chief of Air Staff during the conflict, points to the lack of coordination between the IAF and the Indian army
 Neither side revealed its battle plans to the other
 The battle plans drafted by the Ministry of Defence and General Chaudhari, did not specify a role for the Indian Air Force in the order of battle
 This attitude of Gen
 Chaudhari was referred to by ACM Lal as the "supremo Syndrome", a patronizing attitude sometimes held by the Indian army towards the other branches of the Indian Military
 The Pakistani Army's failures started with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people, given the opportunity provided by the Pakistani advance, would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive surrender of Kashmir
 The Kashmiri people, however, did not revolt
 Instead, the Indian Army was provided with enough information to learn of Operation Gibraltar and the fact that the Army was battling not insurgents, as they had initially supposed, but Pakistani Army regulars
 The Pakistani Army also failed to recognize that the Indian policy makers would order an attack on the southern sector in order to open a second theater of conflict
 Pakistan was forced to dedicate troops to the southern sector to protect Sialkot and Lahore instead using them to support penetrating into Kashmir
 "operation Grand Slam", which was launched by Pakistan to capture Akhnoor, a town north-east of Jammu and a key region for communications between Kashmir and the rest of India, was also a failure
 Many Pakistani commentators criticized the Ayub Khan administration for being indecisive during Operation Grand Slam
 These critics claim that the operation failed because Ayub Khan knew the importance of Akhnur to India and did not want to capture it and drive the two nations into an all-out war
 Despite progress being made in Akhnur, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik and replaced him with Gen
 Yahya Khan
 a 24-hour lull ensued the replacement, which allowed the Indian Army to regroup in Akhnur and successfully oppose a lackluster attack headed by General Yahya Khan
 " Some authors have noted that Pakistan might have been emboldened by a war game – conducted in March 1965, at the Institute of Defence Analysis, USA
 The exercise concluded that, in the event of a war with India, Pakistan would win
 Other authors like Stephen Philip Cohen, have consistently commented that the Pakistan Army had "acquired an exaggerated view of the weakness of both India and the Indian military


 the 1965 war was a shock"
 Pakistani Air Marshal and Commander in Chief of PAF during the war, Noor Khan, later said thgnf fhfhfffhn Army, and not India, should be blamed for starting the war
 However propaganda in Pakistan about the war continued; The war was not rationally analyzed in Pakistan, with most of the blame being heaped on the leadership and little importance given to intelligence failures that persisted until the debacle of the 1971 war, when then East Pakistan was invaded by India and seceded from West Pakistan, leading to the creation of Bangladesh
 hghginj u xxrep 4 j fhffuhhh Pakistan and the United States had signed an Agreement of Cooperation in 1959 under which the United States agreed to take "appropriate action, including the use of armed forces" in order to assist the Government of Pakistan at its request
 However, following the start of the 1965 war, the United States was of the view that the conflict was largely Pakistan's fault and therefore, it cut all military supplies to the country
 However, Pakistan did receive significant support from Iran, Indonesia and People's Republic of China
 Both before and during the war, the People's Republic of China had been a major military associate of Pakistan and had invariably admonished India, with whom it had fought a war in 1962
 There were also reports of Chinese troop movements on the Indian border to support Pakistan As such, India agreed to the UN mandate in order to avoid a war on both borders
 India's participation in the non-aligned Movement yielded little support from its members
 Despite close relations between with India, the Soviet Union was more neutral than most other nations during the war and even invited both nations to talks that it would host in Tashkent
 Despite the declaration of a ceasefire, India was perceived as the victor due to its success in halting the Pakistan-backed insurgency in Kashmir
 In its October 1965 issue, the TIME magazine quoted a Western official assessing the consequences of the war - Now it's apparent to everybody that India is going to emerge as an Asian power in its own right
 In light of the failures of the sino-indian War, the outcome of the 1965 war was viewed as a "politico-strategic" victory in India
 The Indian premier, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was hailed as a national hero in India
 While the overall performance of the Indian military was praised, military leaders were criticized for their failure to effectively deploy India's superior armed forces so as to achieve a decisive victory over Pakistan
 In his book "war in the modern world since 1815", noted war historian Jeremy Black said that though Pakistan "lost heavily" during the 1965 war, bharat's hasty decision to call for negotiations prevented further considerable damage to the Pakistan Armed Forces
 He elaborates — India's chief of army staff urged negotiations on the ground that they were running out ammunition and their number of tanks had become seriously depleted
 In fact, the army had used less than 15% of its ammunition compared to Pakistan, which had consumed closer to 80 percent and India had double the number of serviceable tanks
 As a consequence, bharat focussed on enhancing communication and coordination within and among the triservices of the Indian Armed Forces
 Partly as a result of the inefficient information gathering preceding the war, bharat established the Research and Analysis Wing for external espionage and intelligence
 Major improvements were also made in command and control to address various shortcomings and the positive impact of these changes was clearly visible during the indo-pakistani War of 1971 when India achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan within two weeks
 China's repeated threats to intervene in the conflict in support of Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision to develop nuclear weapons
 Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict which irked India
 At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India
 These developments led to a significant change in India's foreign policy - India, which had previously championed the cause of non-alignment, distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union
 By the end of 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India
 From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India's arms imports were from the Soviet Union
 After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far
 At the conclusion of the war, many Pakistanis considered the performance of their military to be positive
 September 6 is celebrated as 'defence Day' in Pakistan, in commemoration of the successful defence of Lahore against the Indian army
 The performance of the Pakistani Air Force, in particular, was praised
 However, the Pakistani government was accused by foreign analysts of spreading disinformation among its citizens regarding the actual consequences of the war
 In his book "mainsprings of Indian and Pakistani foreign policies", SM Burke writes - After the indo-pakistani war of 1965 the balance of military power had decisively shifted in favor of India
 Pakistan had found it difficult to replace the heavy equipment lost during that conflict while her adversary, despite her economic and political problems, had been determinedly building up her strength
 Most observers agree that the myth of a mobile, hard hitting Pakistan Army was badly dented in the war, as critical breakthroughs were not made
 Several Pakistani writers criticized the military's ill-founded belief that their "martial race" of soldiers could defeat "hindu India" in the war
 Rasul Bux Rais, a Pakistani political analyst wrote - The 1965 war with India proved that Pakistan could neither break the formidable Indian defenses in a blitzkrieg fashion nor could she sustain an all-out conflict for long
 Moreover, Pakistan had lost more ground than it had gained during the war and, more importantly, failed to achieve its goal of occupying Kashmir; This result has been viewed by many impartial observers as a defeat for Pakistan
 Many high ranking Pakistani officials and military experts later criticized the faulty planning of Operation Gibraltar that ultimately led to the war
 The Tashkent declaration was also criticized in Pakistan, though few citizens realised the gravity of the situation that existed at the end of the war
 Political leaders were also criticized
 Following the advice of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's foreign minister, Ayub Khan had raised very high expectations among the people of Pakistan about the superiority – if not invincibility – of its armed forces, but Pakistan's inability to attain its military aims during the war, created a political liability for Ayub
 The defeat of its Kashmiri ambitions in the war led to the army's invincibility being challenged by an increasingly vocal opposition
 One of the most far reaching consequences of the war was the wide-scale economic slowdown in Pakistan
 The cost of the 1965 war put an end to the impressive period economic growth Pakistan had experienced during the early 1960s
 Between 1964 and 1966, Pakistan's defense spending rose from 4
82% to 9
86% of GDP, putting tremendous strain on Pakistan's economy
 By 1970–71, defense spending comprised a whopping 55
66% of government advisory
 Pakistan was surprised by the lack of support by the United States, an ally with whom the country had signed an Agreement of Cooperation
 USA declared its neutrality in the war by cutting off military supplies to both sides, leading Islamabad to believe that they were "betrayed" by the United States
 After the war, Pakistan would increasingly look towards China as a major source of military hardware and political support
 Another negative consequence of the war was the growing resentment against the Pakistani government in East Pakistan, particularly for West Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir
 Bengali leaders accused the central government of not providing adequate security for East Pakistan during the conflict, even though large sums of money were taken from the east to finance the war for Kashmir
 In fact, despite some Pakistan Air Force attacks being launched from bases in East Pakistan during the war, India did not retaliate in that sector, although East Pakistan was defended only by an understrenghted infantry division, sixteen planes and no tanks
 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was critical of the disparity in military resources deployed in East and West Pakistan, calling for greater autonomy for East Pakistan, saanchaa:pakistani sena } nirdeshaank: 25°06′N 85°54′E / 25

 olden ne aitihaasik or bhugolic tathyon ke aadhaar par bataaya ki ghagghar nadi ke ghat par rugveda main bahane vaali nadi saraswati 'drushadwati' thi
 Then the Sutlej and Yamuna rivers did not flow in their present rivers and flowed into the rivers of Ghaggar and Hakra
 mahabharat kaal tak saraswati lupt ho chuki thi or 13 veen shatee tak satluj, vyas main mil gai thi

 It was because of the copper black bangles found in it that it was called Kalibanga
 dhyatavya he ki punjabi main 'vanga' kaa arth chudi hota he, isliye kaali vanga arthath kaali chudiyaan
