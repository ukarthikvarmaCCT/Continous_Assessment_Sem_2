 In the mid-19th century, Charles Darwin gave the scientific theory of evolution through natural selection
 unhone ise apni kitaab jeevajati kaa udbhav main prakashit kiya
 The process of evolution by natural selection can be proved by the following observations: 1) more offspring are born than they can possibly survive, 2) the population has a variety of morphological, physical, and behavioral traits, 3) Different traits provide different chances of post-life and reproduction, and 4) traits are given from one generation to the next
 is prakaar, peedi dar peedi aabaadi un shakson kii santanon dwaara pratisthapit ho jaati he jo us baiophisical parivesh ke behatar anukulit hon
 The process of natural selection creates and retains traits with this virtual purpose that fit its functional role

 Such proposals survived into Roman times

 In contrast to these physical ideas, Aristotelianism regarded all natural things as the real forms of fixed natural possibilities, known as forms
 yah prakruti kii ek madhyayugin doorsanchaar kii samaj kaa hissaa tha jisamen sabhi vastuon kaa ek divya brahmadia kram main khilne ke liye ek mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the Middle Ages and integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real-type creatures always conform to each other for true spiritual forms, and especially new types

 In the 17th century, the new method of modern science rejected the Aristotlean view

 In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertus wrote about the natural modifications that occur during breeding and accumulated over many generations to produce new species
 georges-louis leclerrk, comate di bamphone ne suzav diya ki prajatiyaan alag-alag jeevon main bighad sakati hai, or irasmus darwin ne prastaav kiya tha ki sabhi garm rakt vaale jaanavar ek hi sookshmjeev se utar sakate the
 The first fully developed development plan was jean-baptiste Lemarck's "transformation" theory of 1809, in which healthy generations consistently created simpler forms of life that developed more complexity with a progressive tendency inherent in parallel lineages, and localized At the level, these lineages can be adapted to the environment due to changes in their use or absence in the parents

 In particular, George Cuvre asserted that species are unrelated and determined, their similarities reflect divine design for functional needs
 Meanwhile, William Paly developed Red's ideas into natural theology or the god of existence and existence of Christians

 Partially influenced by an essay on the theory of population by Thomas Robert Malthus, Darwin stated that population growth can lead to a "struggle for survival" in which favorable variation prevails as others die

 It can explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common lineage through the work of natural laws in the same way for all types of organisms

 Thomas Henry Huxley applied Darwin's ideas to humans, using paleontology and comparative anatomy to provide convincing evidence that humans and apes shared a common ancestry

 The mechanisms of reproductive heredity and the origin of new traits remained a mystery
 is disha main, darwin ne pengenesis ke apana asthaayee siddhant viksit kiya
 In 1865, Gregor Mendel reported that the elements were inherited in a predictable manner through independent classification and separation elements
 mandaal ke viraasat ke kanoonon ne antat darwin ke sabase adhik pengensis siddhant kii purti kii
 August Weismann has significant differences between germ cells that give rise to gametes and somatic cells of the body, showing that heredity only passes through the germ line

 De Wills was also one of the researchers who made Mendel's work well known, assuming that Mendelian traits correspond to the transfer of genetic changes at the germline

 In 1973, the evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobhansky wrote that "nothing in biology leaves the light of evolution", because it brought to light the earlier relationship to the contradictory facts of those natural relations, a knowledge of which Explains in clear explanatory body and many observational facts about life on this planet have been speculated

 Natural selection within a population for a trait, which can vary on a variety of values such as elevation, can be classified into three different types
 The first is directional selection, which over time is associated with a particular trait
 The average value changes — for example, organisms gradually become higher
 duusare, vighatnkaaree chayan atyadhik gun mulyon ke liye chayan hota he or aksar do alag-alag mulyon main sabase aam ho jaataa he, ausat mulya ke khilaaf chayan ke saath
 This will happen when either miniature or high organisms have an advantage, but not of medium height
 Finally, stabilizing selection involves choosing between extreme characteristics on either side, which is the average value and low diversity
 Reduces the variance around

 Theva is a unique handicraft that flourished under the patronage of the royal houses of Rajasthan during the Mughal period in the 17th century
 theva kii hastkala kala striyon ke liye sone minaakaari or paardarshee kaanch ke mail se nirmit aabhushan ke nirmaan se sambaddh he
 Many of its craftsmen-families live only in Pratapgarh district of Rajasthan
 theva-aabhushanon ke nirmaan main vibhinn rangon ke shishon ko chaandi ke maheen taron se bane frem main daal kar us par sone kii baarik kalakritiyaan ukeri jaati he, jinhen kushal or daksh haath chote-chote aujaaron kii madad se banaate hai
 This jewelery-making art is one of the few in the world because of its originality and artistry - which can quickly become extinct in the absence of international market and marketing
 "theva" naam kii utpatti is kala ke nirmaan kii do mukhya prakriyaaon 'tharana' or 'waada' se mil kar hui he
 In this art, on the first glass, a very thin work or sheet of gold is made, and a fine mesh is made on it, which is called tharana
 duusare charan main kaanch ko kasne ke liye chaandi ke baarik taar se frem banaaya jaataa he, jise "wada" kaha jaataa he
 It is then heated in a fiery fire

 In this way, each specimen of the craft is made of transparent glass and has an appearance like rubies, emeralds and sapphires
 is kala ko ukerne main belgium se vishesh prakaar ke kaanch istemaal hote the, par aise kaanchon kii anuplabdhta se ab alag umdaa kaanch kaa istemaal hota hai
 Initially, Theva's work was done only on the precious stones of red, blue and green, diamond, emerald, etc
 But now this work is also being done on yellow, pink and black glass gems
 pehle is kala se banaae jane vaale baks, plates, dish aadi par dharmik anukritiyaan or lokapriy lokkathaayen ukeri jaati thim, lekin ab yah kala aabhushan ke saath-saath pendents, year-ring, taai or sadiyon kii pin, kafalinks, photophreme aadi main bhi prachlit ho chali he
 Efforts are being made to popularize this art by diversifying the modern fashion into various designs
 is kala ko jaanane vaale desh main ab gine chune parivaar hi bache hai
 These families belong to the Rajsoni family living in the newly formed Pratapgarh district of Rajasthan, which has received several international, national and state level awards for this unique art

 It is noteworthy that Geographical Indication is given to a product for its geographical quality and identity with its origin and prevalence in particular location
 theva kala ke liye raashtrapati puraskaar se sammanit or theva kala santhaan ke ek hastshilpi sadsy mahesh raaj soni ko vishwaas he ki ab bhugolic upadarshan sankhya milane ke baad yah kala apni bhugolic pahchaan ko acchhee tarah se kaayam rakhane main kaamyaab ho paayegi

 Although the word 'rail' has entered almost all languages, yet in many languages local words have been coined for it
 dhyaan dijiye ki yah shabd koshon or sarkari dastavezon main to milten hai lekin aksar saamaanya prayog main nahin hai
 In many languages, words have been invented by taking the idea of rail as 'iron path' or 'vehicle traveling on iron path'

 In the Mahabharata period, when the Pandavas' house was burnt in exile, on the advice of Vidur, they fled from there to another forest, where the Hidimbasura demon king with yellow eyes, who was the king of the forest of the forest called Maha Daitya Forest, was his sister
 Used to live with Hindiba
 ek din hidimb ne apni bahan hindiba se van main bhojan kii talash karne ke liye bheja parantu vahaan hindiba ne paanchon pandavon sahit unki mata kunti ko dekha
 This demon fell in love with Bhima on seeing this, so he did not kill them all, which Hidimb felt very bad
 phir krodhit hokar hidimb ne pandavon par hamalaa kiya, is yuddh main bhim ne ise maar daalaa or phir vahaan jangal main kunti kii ajna se hindiba evam bhim donon kaa vivaah hua
 He had a son named Ghatotkacha
 laakshagrih ke dahan ke pashchaat surang ke raste laakshagrih se nikal kar pandav apni mata ke saath van ke andar chale gayi
 Leaving Bhimsen due to many curses, the remaining people were exhausted from fatigue and lay down under a banyan tree
 mata kunti pyaas se vyakul thim isaliye bhimsen kisi jalashay yaa sarovar kii khoj main chale gayi
 When a reservoir was in view, he first drank water himself and returned to mother and brothers to feed him
 ve sabhi thakaan ke kaaran gahari nidra main nimagn ho chuke the atah bhim vahaan par paharaa dene lage
 In that forest was inhabited by a terrible asura named Hidimb
 maanvon kaa gandh milane par usne pandavon ko pakad laane ke liye apni bahan hidimba ko bheja taaki vah unhen apana aahaar bana kar apni kshudha purti kar sake
 On reaching there, Hidimba saw Bhimsen guarding him and became enamored of him by seeing his handsome Mukharvind and his body
 usne apni rakshasi maaya se ek apurv laavanmayi sundari kaa rup bana liya or bhimsen ke paas ja pahaunchi
 Bhimsen asked him, "O beautiful! Who are you and why are you wandering alone in this terrible forest at night?" In response to Bhima's question, Hidimba said, "O Narashrestha! i am a demon named Hidimba
 mere bhai ne mujhe aap logon ko pakad kar laane ke liye bheja he kintu meraa hriday aap par aasakt ho gaya he tathaa main aapako apane pati ke rup main praapt karnaa chaahati hoon
 My brother Hidimb is very wicked and cruel, but i have enough strength to save you from his clutches and reach a safe place
 " Seeing the delay in returning his sister here, Hidimb reached the place where Hidimba was talking to Bhimsen
 hidimba ko bhimsen ke saath premalap karte dekhakar vah krodhit ho uthaa or hidimba ko dand dene ke liye uski ore jhapata
 Seeing this, Bhima stopped him and said, "O evil demon! You do not feel ashamed to raise your hand on a woman? If you are so brave and mighty then fight me
 " itnaa kah kar bhimsen taal thonk kar uske saath mall yuddh karne lage
 Kunti and other Pandavas also got sleep
 vahaan par bhim ko ek rakshas ke saath yuddh karte tathaa ek rupavati kanya ko khadi dekh kar kunti ne poocha, "putree! tum koun ho?" hidimba ne sari baaten unhen bataa di
 Arjuna lifted his bow to kill Hidimba, but Bhima refused to release the arrow, "anuj! Don't leave the arrow, it is my prey and will die at my own hands
" " itnaa kah kar bhim ne hidimb ko donon haathon se pakad kar uthaa liya or use hawa main anek baar ghuma kar itani tivrata ke saath bhoomi par pataka ki uske praan-pakheru ud gayi
 When Hidimba died, they began preparing for departure from there, upon which Hidimba fell at Kunti's feet and prayed, "O mother! i have accepted your son Bhima as her husband
 aap log mujhe krupa karke sweekaar kar lijiye
 If you do not accept me, then i will give up my life at this moment
 " hidimba ke hriday main bhim ke prati prabal prem kii bhaavana dekh kar yudhisthir bole, "hidimbe! main tumhen apane bhai ko saunpta hoon kintu yah keval din main tumhaare saath rahaa karegaa or raatri ko ham logon ke saath rahaa karegaa
 "hidimba agreed to this and started living happily with Bhimsen
 ek varsh vyateet hone par hidimba kaa putr utpann hua
 She was named Ghatotkacha because of her lack of hair on her head
 vah atyant mayavi niklaa or janm lete hi bada ho gaya
 Hidimba took his son to the Pandavas and said, "this is your brother's son, so he will be in service of you
" " itnaa kah kar hidimba vahaan se chali gai
 Ghatotkacha bowed with reverence at the feet of the Pandavas and Mother Kunti and said, "now tell me my worthy service
 ? uski baat sun kar kunti boli, "tu mere vansh kaa sabase bada pautra he
 Your service will definitely be taken when the time comes
 " is par ghatotkach ne kaha, "aap log jab bhi mujhe samaran karenge, main aap logon kii seva main upasthit ho jaaungaa
 "having said this, Ghatotkacha went towards the present Uttarakhand

 In economics, the law of demand is an important rule which describes the direction of change in the demand of that commodity as a result of the change in the price of a commodity
 yah ek gunatmak kathan he
 From this, it is known that if the price of the commodity decreases, the demand for that item will increase or if the price increases, the demand for that item will decrease
 kisi vastu kii keemat main hone vaale parivartan ke parinamswaroop maang main hone vaale anupatik parivartan kii jaankaree jis dharna se hoti he use maang kii loch kaha jaataa he
 Therefore, it would be fair to say that elasticity of demand is a quantitative statement
 kisi vastu kii keemat main hone vaale parivartan ke falswaroop us vastu kii maangi gai maatra main hone vaale parivartan kii maap ko hi maang kii loch kaha jaataa he
 Modern economists Boulding and Mrs
 John Robinson have shown the price elasticity of demand mathematically
 shrimati jon robinsan ke anusaar, maang kii loch kisi mulya yaa utpaadan par mulya main alp parivartan ke falswaroop kray kii gai maatra ke anupatik parivartan ko mulya ke anupatik parivartan se bhaag dene par praapt hoti he
 This can be expressed as the following formula - jahaan e d { \ displaystyle E_{d}} loch, q d { \ displaystyle Q_{d}} maang kii maatra, tathaa p { \ displaystyle P} mulya he
 Hence, it would be fair to say that 'price elasticity of demand' is the rate of change in the quantity demanded of a commodity as a result of its change in price
 ek sabun kaa mulya pehle 10 rupaye tha or isaki bikri 1 lakh pratidin thi
 When its value was increased to Rs 11, then its sales decreased to 95 thousand per day

 The concept of sociological jurisprudence is relatively modern
 iskaa udbhav unnisvin sadi main hua jab maanav yah anubhav karne laga ki samaaj ke vikaas ke liye use saamaajik anushaasan main rahakar aapasi sahyog kaa maarg apnaanaa nitant aavashyak he
 Presently, more emphasis is being laid on the social side than on the individual side of man
 vidhi kaa saamaajik parivartanon se nikatatam sambandh hone k kaaran vah maanav ke is badale hue drushtikon se aprabhavit hue bina na rah sakaa
 As a result, a new method of jurisprudence emerged which developed in the name of sociological jurisprudence
 iske antargat vidhi ke saamaajik pahalu par adhik jor diya gaya he
 Sociological jurisprudence has also been called the 'jurisprudence of interests' because the main goal of every social system is to preserve and promote the interests of human beings
 vidhi ke prati is drushtikon kaa apnaane vaale vidhishastriyon kaa vichaar he ki maanav ke paraspar virdohi hiton main samanvay sthapit karnaa vidhishastra kaa pramukh kaary he
 German ideologist Rudolf Ihring developed this ideology more
 unke anusaar vidhi na to swatantra rup sa viksit hui he or na vah rajya kii manamaani dein hi he
 It is also not based on prudence but on expediency as its basic objective is to eliminate the conflict between conflicting interests of society and establish coordination and uniformity among them
 samajashastreey vidhishastra ke vidhishastriyon ke anusaar nyaayalayon ke liye yah aavashyak he ki vidhi ke amoort or lekhabaddh swaroop par vishesh jor na dekar usak vyaavhaarik pahalu par adhik bal den arthath ve un saamaajik aavashyaktaaon or uddeshyon kii jaanch karen jo sambandhit kanoon paarit hone ke liye karneebhoot hue hai
 Sociological jurisprudence has received strong support in the US
 prasiddh america vidhishastri dean rasko pound ne to vidhishastra ko ‘saamaajik abhiyantriki’ kii sangya di he
 According to this ideology, mainly two things are studied under jurisprudence- vidhishastra ke prati samajashastreey drushtikon apanaaye jane ke falswaroop america main yathartwaadee vichaardhaara kaa pradurbhaav hua jiske antargat vidhi ke kriyaatmak pahalu ko itnaa adhik mahatv diya gaya he ki isse samhitaon or adhiniyamon ke amoort niyamon tathaa unamem sannihit siddhanton kaa mahatv newnepraay ha gaya
 Adopting a purposive approach to law and jurisprudence, realists transformed the law from imaginary principles to a fact-based form of facts and thus considered the method to be a functional tool for solving social problems
 is vichaardhaara ke prabal samarthak jerome frank kaa maananaa tha ki vidhi kaa niyat rahanaa ek kaalpanik tathy he kyonki vidhi sadaiv hi parivartansheel hoti he or isiliye vidhi ke samhitakaran yaa purv-nirnyon ko vishesh mahatv nahin diya janaa chahie
 According to Frank, the development of law has a direct relation with social progress
 levillin ne vidhishastra ko saamaajik pragati kaa strot maanate hue uske kriyaatmak pahalu par bal diya gaya he
 According to him, it is the duty of the practitioner to study and analyze the law in the context of contemporary social problems
 vidhi ko saiddhanthik daayre se hatakar maanav jivan ke vyaavhaarik pahalu se samasyaon ke nivaaran main sahaayak hona chahie
 In the historical perspective, see the prevalent apartheid, slavery, satyapratha, untouchability, child marriages etc
 were abolished by law
 in saamaajik buraaiyon ko vidhi dwaara samaapt ghoshit karne ke pashchaat unhe prerit karne ko bhi dandic aparaadh ghashit kar diya gaya
 Thus the Hindu society got freedom from the practice of Sati
 isi prakaar, karnataka main sadiyaan puraani devdasi pratha samaapt samaapt karnaa isliye aavashyak mana gaya he kyonki yah vyavastha bhrsht ho gayi thi aar apane mul lakshya se bhatak gai thi
 Apart from this, many laws were developed to remove many kinds of social evils, so that there was continuous action in the law for social change and it became the mainstay of social change
 vidhi kaa naveen srijan hi samaaj ko us buraai se mukti dilaataa he or iske kaaran saamaajikparivartan hota he
 The great credit for the fame of the Pound goes to his social engineering
 ve vidhi ke kaaryo ko saamaajik abhiyantriki kehete hai
 Lound, considers the law not an abstract object but a social truth, an objective and one to overcome and reconcile conflicts / conflicts
 unke anusaar vidhi samaaj kaa hitvardhak, kalyankaarak tathaa vyaktiyon ke swaarthon ko kam karne vaala hota he
 If the method is not useful or functional, then it has no value for society
 samaaj ke liye kanoon ek esa saadhan he jiske dwaara shaanti, sukh, samruddhi aar vikaas aadi saamaajik uddeshyon kii prapti ho sakati he
 It has an invaluable contribution in the future development of the society
 nyaay prashasan main to vidhi kii ahm bhoomika hoti he, isaliye vidhi kaa nirmaan saamaajik paristhitiyon,, maang, iccha araavashyaktaaon ke aadhaar par kiya janaa chahie
 Pounds have described the method as helpful in this area, so that production can be consumed and distributed
 kanoon hameshaa samaaj kii pragati ke liye banaaye jate he, samaaj kii pragati ko raakane ke liye nahin
 Therefore, law is also expected to be progressive with society
 samaaj ke logon ke saamaanya hiton tathaa swaarth main samanvay na baitaane par vah ugr rup dhaaran karke samaaj kii shaanti vyavastha par pratikul prabhaav daal saktaa he
 This method only works
 isi ko pounds saamaajik abhiyantran naam dete he
 For this, it is necessary in any welfare state to be aware of social needs and circumstances etc

 unhon apane vashanjo ko kaary soup kar apni kalaon ko saare sansar me failaayaa or aadi yug se ajalak apane-apane kaary ko sabhaalate chale aa rahe he
 Vishwakarma is recognized as a Vedic deity, but his mythological form appears to be different
 aarambhik kaal se hi vishwakarma ke prati sammaan kaa bhav rahaa he
 He is said to be the creator and promoter of the facilities required for an institution like Grihastha
 vah sristi ke pratham sutaradhar kahe gaye hai- Devou hundred sutradhar: Jagadkhil Hit: Dhyayate Sarvasattvae
 vaastu ke 18 upadeshtaon main vishwakarma ko pramukh mana gaya he
 Not only in North, but also in South India, where the texts of Maya have been accepted, Vishwakarma's views are easily recognized
 varahamihir ne bhi kai sthanon par vishwakarma ke maton ko uddhrut kiya he
 In the first part of the Vishnupurana, Vishwakarma has been called Vardhaki or dev-carpenter of the Gods and is revered as Shilpavatara
 yahi manyata anek puraanon main ai he, jabaki shilp ke granthon main vah srishtikarta bhi kahe gaye hai

 This text also shows that Vishwakarma also gave knowledge to his three other sons Jai, Vijay and Siddharth
 shri vishwakarma vanshavali Just as many incarnations of God like Rama Krishna are described in the Puranas, similarly the incarnations of Lord Vishwakarma are described
 skanda puraana ke kaashi khand main mahadev ji ne parvati ji se kaha he ki he parvati main aap se paap naashak katha kahata hum
 In the same story, Mahadev ji told the story of Parvati ji appearing as Vishwakameshwar linga, in relation to the son of Tvashtha Prajapati: pratham avatar Vishwakarma s Bhavatava Brahman Stavapara s Tanuh

 Scholars are fully aware that the Vishwakarma Sukta is given in the Rigveda and there are 14 hymns in this Sukta, the deity of this Sukta is Vishwakarma and the mantra visha is the sage Vishwakarma
 vishwakarma sookt 14 ullekh isi granth vishwakarma-vijay prakaash main diya he

 pathakagan
 From the many evidences of Vedas and Puranas, we have created Vishwakarma as the divine Supreme Father, the creator of the world, and have also told the incarnations of Vishwakarma from the Puranas
 ab bhi koi hatdhamin karen to hamaare paas unka ilaaj karne kaa tarika bhi he
 These takapanthi food kilns have done a lot of finesse
 vishwakarma dev kii avehalanaa karne se hi is samay brahman, kshatriya aadi kshtmay jivan vyateet kar rahe he
 Neither do they have their own origins, seeing this brilliant Brahmin does not pay any attention to the words of Padma Purana, see how clearly it is said
 arth vishnu or vishwakarma main koi bhed nahi
 Vishwakarma decorated with many names jagatakarta vishwakarma bhauvan vishwakarma, rishi vishwakarma dharm granthon main anek avataran aaye he
 The subject is divided into many names, Vishwakarma is Brahmin karma, that is, Vishwakarma is a pure Brahmin who claims to be a child and describes himself as a Panchal Shilpi Brahmin
 yahaan ham dharmagranthon ke pramaamon ko dekar ant main grathon ke aadhaar par bhrigu, angira, manu, may, twashta, shilpi or daivejna aadi kii vanshavali bhi sapramaan dikhaayenge
 In ancient scriptures shilpagya, vishwakarma brahmanon ko rathkaar vardhaki, etab kavi, moyavi, paanchaal, rathpati, suhast saura or parasar aadi shabdon main sambodhit kiya gaya tha
 At that time, the goods of the present day irons, woodworkers and goldsmiths, etc
, did not have different millennia
 pracheen samay main shilp karm bahut unchaa samajha jaataa tha, kyonki dharmagranthon kii khoj main hamen pataa chalata he ki brahman, kshatriya, vaisya teenon hi varna rath karm arthath shilp karm karaten the
 Before giving some evidence of Vishwakarma Brahmins about Brahmanism, it is considered appropriate to understand a little about words like charioteer, Pachanal, Narasas, etc
 jisase aage ko jo dharm shastron ke pramaan ham dikhaayenge unamem jab in shabdon main se koi aave to hamaare pathakon ko samajhane main kathinaayee na paden
 Charioteer yah shabd pracheen dharmagranthon main anek sthalon par aayaa he or unken shilpi brahman ke sthaan main prayog hua he
 That is, Lokkars, Kashtakars, Swarnakars, Silavatas and Tamarakaras, all the skilled proficient craftsmen who do all the work, have been understood only by the word Rathkaar and the same words have been written in the Vedas and Puranas also for craftsman Brahmins
 skanda puraana nagar khand adhyay 6 main rathkaar shabd kaa prayog hua haih Sadojajata the Panchabhyo Mukhebhya: Panch Nirbhaye

 Meaning: Shankar said that o Skanda, Sadyojat Vamadeva, Tattu Purusha, Adheer and Ishaan were born from the five faces of the five Brahma Sagnanka Vishwakarma

 The Vishwakarma, who took many forms, gave his sons ten craft armaments, ten tools, gold, etc
, nine metal iron, wood etc
 uske yah shatekarm karne vaale rathkaar sristi kaary ke panchanidh pavitra karm karne lage
 Ashtadhyayi Panini Sutra text grammar, Shilpini Cha Kutra: 6 / 2 / 76 Sagyanayancha 6 / 2 / 77 Siddhanta Kaumudi Vriti: Shilpi Vachini Samase Ashantate in the grammar of the word Rathakara being a Brahmin indicator

 This means that in the grammar scripture, the word rathakara has been proved to be an Arya gotra, a Brahmin caste and has also given the example of the name Rathakars as Brahmin
 jisase siddh kiya gaya he ki rathkaar shabd brahman jati bodhak he kyoking- rathn karotin iti rathkaara
 That is, the Brahmin who built the chariot is understood by the word charioteer in ancient texts
 yahaan yah bhi likh dena jaruri jaan pastaan he ki smritiyon main rathkaar ek sankeern jati ko bhi likhaa he, parantu jahaan pavitra dev shilp aadi kaa varnan aata he
 There Shilpi Brahmin Santi Rathkar means only
 aapako ratkaar vishay main shaastra ke mantra or rathkaar kaa pracheen samay main jo maan, samaann pratishtha thi us samay vishwakarma kaa rathkaar rup vistrut tha
 Raje Maharaja used to respect all Vishwakarma charioteers because artists used to lead in the creation of the nation, it was among the Brahmin class charioteers
 paanchal As a sample of the subject of the word charioteer, he has given the above example
 ab isi bhaatin ek do udhaaharan paanchal shabd ke vishay main bhi dekar bataavenge ki vishwakarma brahmanon ko pracheen dharm granthon main paanchal bhi kaha gaya he
 The Barah Purana states: paanchal brahmaneti haasah kathan

 In the above evidences, the word Pachan has been used in place of Vishwakarma

 Architecture yajna karm or dev karm sambandhi karm main kahin kahin vishwakarma pachal brahman kii sagyaan sthapaty bhi kahi gai he
 Just as the architectural Vishwakarma Shastra is written in Bhagwat Skanda 3, it means that Yajna Sambadhi and Dev Sambadhi are the Brahmin children of Vishwakarma, who perform the sacred craft

 Some authors like Bodhanayana, a sutrakha, have written the senior Shaunak Atri, Bhrigu, Kanva, Vadhnyshva, Vadhul, Aartheya gotra of this gotra b Narashan Panchalas
 keval angiras kul ke prasiddh rishi The above mentioned Vashnawali is given, it is quoted from the proof-of-mouth

 They are mentioned in the Vedas, Brahmin texts, Shruti, Smriti, Ramayana, Mahabharata and all the Puranas
 aginra kul param shreshth kul he
 Angira angira rishi ke vishay main matsay puraana, bhagwat, vaayu puraana mahabharat or bharatvarshiya pracheen aitihaasik kosh main varnan kiya gaya he
 In Matsya Purana, the origin of Angira Rishi is said to be from Agni
 bhagwat kaa kathan he ki angira ji brahma ke mukh se yajna hetu utpann hue
 In Mahabharata Anu Parva Chapter 83 it is said that the great King Angira Bhrigu etc

 Angiras Dev was Dhanush and Baan Dhari, he was married to Surupa, daughter of sage Marich and Swaraat, daughter of Kardam Rishi, and Manu, the daughter of Kanya Pathya
 suruma ke garbh se brihaspati, swarat se gautam, prabandh, vamdev utathy or ushir yah paanch putr janmen, pathyaa ke garbh se vishnu sanwart, vichit, ayasya asij, dirghatama, sudhanva yah saat putr utpann hue
 The sage was born to Utthya Rishi, Brihadukathya came from Vamdev
 maharishi sudhanva ke rishi vibhma or baj yah teen putr hue
 These sages were sons
 maharishi sudhanva ke rishi vibhma or baj yah teen putr hue
 This sage was a great deity in the son of Athakara, yet he has been counted among the sages
 brihaspati kaa putr maha kishasvi bharadwaj hua, yah sab angira bhrigu aadi dv shilp ke nirmaan vaale rathkaar naam se prasiddh hue
 In this it was clearly proved that in ancient times, the Brahmins used to say charioteer and the word charioteer is Brahmin caste, in this subject, we have proved that the word rathakara in the past was strictly Brahmin on the basis of grammar
