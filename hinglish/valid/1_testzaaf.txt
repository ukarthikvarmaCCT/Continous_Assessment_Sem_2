 In this context, in the legal case "50 Ind Cas 424" filed by the Allahabad High Court in 1918, it was passed that the word "ghosi" is used in the Hindu community to refer to a genuine peasant caste, which is the Hindu Ahir caste only

 The word Ghosh means "to call" the animal school, or from the literary point of view, "colonize the Abhiras"
 
 According to the Vedas and Puranas, Ghosh means "to clamor", in the Vedic period, the first settlement of Ahirs or the village of Ahirs was called Ghosh

 In the ancient times, the Hindu Ahirs called Gwala or Gopal came to be called Ghosi after the conversion of Muslim religion
 parantu vyaavhaarik rup se kisi bhi dharm yaa jati ke gwaale ko ghosi kaha jaataa he
 Generally it can be said that any Muslim who became a Gwala came to be called Ghosi and later this name came to be used for any Ahir or Gawale, hence, both Hindu Ahirs and their Muslim rivals jointly called Ghosi

 The important fact about the Ghoshis is that all the Ghoshis in the northwestern areas are Muslims but most of the Ghoshis in Central India are Hindus who call themselves Ghoshi Thakurs and claim to be Rajputs, people of other castes are also often called Thakurs
 Let's address it
 parantu sagar va damoh ilaakon main kshatritv kii aakanksha itani prabal he ki yadi kisi se uski jati poochni he to vyaavhaarik prashn is tarah kiya jaataa he ki -"aap koun se thakur he?" According to the "mainpuri Settlement Report" - the Ahirs are a dominating caste in the Mainpuri area of uttar Pradesh, their population including Ghoshis is said to be 16
8 percent of the total population of the area, and here presently the Ghoshi class is more than other sections of the Ahirs
 Is in number mainpuri me ghoshiyon kaa ek varg swayan ko mewar ke rana katira kaa vanshaj bataate hai
 Due to the Muslim invaders, Rana Katira left her kingdom and took refuge with the Ahir king Digpal of Mahavan

 In North India, Ghoshi Ahirs are divided into many sub-clans or clans, such as Babaria or Barabaiya, Phatak, Jivaria or Jarwaria, Fataqalu or Phatikas, Karaiya, Shondale, Raut, Lahugaya, Anguri, Bhrigude or Bhrigudeva, Ginduya or Guduya, Nigana and Dhumar or Dhunar etc

 In the twentieth century it was Ghosi Nita who pioneered the social upliftment of the Yadavs, so that the Yadavs emerged at the political level
 pratham yadav jaagran adhiveshan, 1912 ke prarambh me ghoshi yadav netaaon dwaara 'yadav mahasabha' ke tatvadhan me shikohabad ke brahmavaar-laajpur gaanv main karaayaa gaya

 "mulayam Singh and the big politicians of his party belong to the sub-caste of Yadavs
 is upjati ko mulaayam ke sattarum hone kaa sabase zyada laabh mila
 And the other sub-caste "ghoshi", despite being two-thirds of the Yadav community of central Uttar Pradesh, was deprived of any political gains even though the Ghosis wholeheartedly supported the party
 ” The optimistic leaders of the Congress always expect to divide Yadavs, as Yadavs necessarily vote only for Mulayam Singh's Samajwadi Party
 unka laanchhan ye he ki, mulaayam singh, ek kamariya netaa he atah vah ghoshiyon ke hiton ko andekha karte he
 According to a Congress leader - "we prefer the representation of Ghoshis in the selection of candidates, because the population of Ghoshi Yadavas is more than that of Kamariya Yadavas in Uttar Pradesh

 The Brahmanda Purana mentions that two demon brothers, Malla and Mani, were protected by a boon from Lord Brahma

 Then Lord Shiva as Khandoba riding his bull, Nandi

 Mani offers him a horse and seeks a boon from God for the good of mankind
 khandoba ne khushi se yah vardaan diya
 The other demon Malla asked for the destruction of mankind
 tab bhagwan ne uskaa sar kaat kar mandir kii sidhiyon par chhod diya taaki mandir main pravesh ke samay bhakt dwaara kuchal diya ja sake

 There is no doubt that initially it was akin to or consistent with Vikramayulya, but after the introduction of Islam, it does not seem appropriate to consider the value of intercourse with marriage
 arabi smritishastragyon ne isaki tulana vikraymoolya se isliye kii he ki muslim vyavastha main yah naagarik sambandhi anubandh samajha jaataa he
 In the pre-islamic era of Islam, the bridegroom, which was payable to her parents, was called Mahar and the money which was given as honor and affectionate gift to the woman was called Sadak
 donon main antar samajha jaataa tha
 Islam tried to convert Mahar into a real system in favor of women
 durdin ke liye ek saadhan ke rup main or saamaajik drushti se pati ke talaak ke aseem adhikaar ke manamaane prayog par yah ek ankush ho gaya tha
 If the husband divorces his woman, the entire amount of money will be immediately payable
 aadhunik sambuddha dharna mahar ke vishay main yah he ki mahar vivaah kaa paritoshik nahin he varan stri ke prati aadar suchit karne ke liye pati ke upar vidhi dwaara daalaa gaya daayitv he
 This is confirmed by the fact that even when there is no detailed mention of Mahar at the time of marriage, there is no effect on the legality of the marriage
 yadi mahar vadhoomulya hota to vivaah ke baad mahar pradaan karne ke liye anubandh hone par paritoshik ke abhaav main vah avaidh hota
 But such a covenant is valid and enforceable
 pati mahar ke rup main koi dhanrashi apni stri ke liye nishchit kar saktaa he, chaahe yah uski samarthy se adhik hi kyon na ho or chaahe is dhanrashi ke dene ke baad uske uttaradhikariyon ke liye kuch bhi na batch paae
 But in no case can he arrange less than 10 dharm
 mahar anubandh main ullikhit sampurna dhanrashi pradaan karata he jab tak ki kisi dhara sabha kii vidhi iske vipareet na ho
 Mahar is often high to save the woman from getting divorced by the husband of Muslims of India
 talaak kii sthiti main sweekrut dhanrashi use deni hi padegi or yah tark ki sweekrut dhanrashi atyadhik he yaa pati kii samarthy ke baahar he, patni ko use dene se bachane ke liye paryaapt na hoga
 The court can use its will in determining the amount of money of Mahar only when he is empowered by the law of section assembly
 keval pati kii samarthy tathaa stri kii sthiti kaa samyak vichaar hi dhanrashi nirnay karne main nirnaayak tathy hoga
 The mentioned mahar can be fixed before, on or after the occasion of marriage and can be increased within the marital life
 yadi pati avyask ho to mahar uske pita dwaara nishchit kiya ja saktaa he or pati dwaara diya ja saktaa he
 The prevalence among the Shia people is that if the boy is unable to give his wife the honor, then the father is personally responsible for giving the mother
 yadi mahar kii raashi nishchit nahin he to patni uchit mahar kii yaa maharemisal kii adhikarini hoti he
 It is taken care of in deciding what is a proper Mahr, how much Mahr has been given to the women in her father's family, such as her father's sisters
 chunki mahar patni kaa nihit adhikaar he, at: uski maang par yah praapt hona chahie or yah pranpt mahar kaha jaataa he
 But sometimes Mahar is payable on the separation of marriage by death or divorce and is called Deferred Mahar
 taatkaalik mahar patni dwaara kisi bhi samay vivaah ke uparaant liya ja saktaa he, chaahe vivaah purna yaa pakkaa hua ho yaa nahin
 If it has not been determined at the time of marriage that the mahar is instantaneous or deferred, then according to the Shia law it will be deemed to be instantaneous
 yadhyapi sunni use anshat: taatkaalik or anshat asthgit samajhate hai, donon kaa anupaat reeti yaa ubhay paksh kii sthiti par aadhaarit hoga
 The wife may leave Mahar or any part of it in favor of her husband or his heirs with his will
 yah parityag vaid hota he, bhale hi yah bina paritoshik ke ho
 It is necessary that the abandonment was made by him at his own volition
 jab tak ki mahar kaa parityag na kiya gaya ho patni iske paane kaa adhikaar rakhti he, yadhyapi vivaah is shart par anubandhit hua ho ki vah kisi muaavje kii maang na karegi
 The wife may refuse to go to the husband unless the immediate status is given
 yadi pati uske viruddh vaivaahik sambandhon ke pratipaadan ke liye vaad prastut karata he, to mahar kaa na diya janaa hi patni ke liye yathesht bachaav he or vaad khaarij ho jayega
 On the other hand, if the mahar is not given, then the wife or his heirs after his death shall be called for it from the date when the immediate mahar is sought, or it is rejected, or when the marriage or divorce has resulted in the separation of the marital relationship
 Within three years, the suit can be filed
 mrit musalmaan ke uttaradhikari vyaktigat rup se mahar dene ke liye uttaradaayi nahin hai
 But they are liable in proportion to their share of the property found from the deceased person
 mahar ek rin ke rup main he or vidhwaa apane mrit pati ke duusare mahajanon ke saath uski sampatti se iske bhugtan kii adhikarini hoti he, lekin uskaa adhikaar asurakshit mahajan ke adhikaar se adhik nahin hota
 If she has the property of her husband in her possession which she has lawfully acquired in exchange for the Mahar without deception or coercion so that she can satisfy the rights of rent and profits, then she will be held against the other heirs of her husband in that possession Can be maintained till the satisfaction of Mahr's self is satisfied

 Labor control and intra-group conflict are characteristic of corporate level or 'tribal' groups led by a charismatic individual; Whether it is a 'big man' or a proto-head who works as a group head for a year
 Whether the non-classified system of organization exists is debatable or there is no evidence that clearly shows that Neolithic society functioned under a dominant class or individual, as did the chieftaincy system of the European Early Bronze Age

 Skepticism is called Scapticism in Anglo language

 But his skepticism was normal

 Among medieval Western skeptics, Pascal and Hume are more famous in modern skeptics
 pascal kaa kahana tha ki sansar sambandhi koi bhi nishchit yaa santoshprad siddhant buddhi dwaara sthapit nahin kiya ja saktaa or hum mahoday ne hamaari jaanane kii kshamta ko keval anubhavik kshetra tak hi simit batalaaya he
 According to him, man has no right to know or say anything outside his sensory experience
 koi koi vichaarasmeekshak prasiddh german darshanik kaant ko bhi sanshaywaadiyon main shaamil kar lete hai; parantu unhen sanshaywaadee na kahkar agyeyavaadee kahana adhik upyukt he, kyonki unhone vastuon ke vaastavik yaa parmaarthik swaroop ko agyeya yaa buddhi dwaara agamya batalaaya he, sandehaaspad nahin
 And at least they have considered the ability to understand the work force
 bharatvarsh ke kuch sanshaywaadiyon kaa ullekh "shramanyafalsutra" aadi kuch buddha granthon main miltaa he
 For example, a thinker named Ajitakesakambali said that true knowledge is never possible and the author of the manuscript titled "tattavopallav Singh" published in the Gaekwad Oriental Series, Mr
 Jayarashi, did not consider any evidence, even direct evidence, to be a means of unquestionable knowledge
 
 kabhi-kabhi kuch log "syadasti syat naasti" aadi shabdon dwaara pratipaadit jain darshan ke syadwad kaa bhi sanshaywad samajhane lagate hai
 But in fact, the use of the word "syat", rendered sycophantic, does not imply the skepticism of the sentence, but it refers to the relativity of truth
 swaadwad ko paramarshon yaa nirnyo kaa satyatv, paristhiti evam prasanganukool, sweekaarya he
 Regardless of what the skeptics themselves say, the mental state of skepticism is not a state of happiness
 or purna rup se sanshaywaadee hona atyant kathin hi nahin, kintu asambhav he
 The acceptance of skepticism itself refutes its belief
 yadi kisi bhi prakaar kaa nishchit gyaan nahin ho saktaa, to phir yah nishchay rup se kaise kaha ja saktaa he ki kisi bhi prakaar kaa nishchit gyaan sambhav nahin
 Either skepticism is irreducible or skepticism itself proves to be corrupted by "stigma defect"
 iske atirikt, hamaare vyaavhaarik jivan kaa ek ek kaary tatsambandhi padaarth yaa vyakti ke nishchit gyaan kii manyata par nirbhar rahata he
 He cannot walk on accepting skepticism completely
 isiilie to shrimadbhagavadgita main "sanshayatma vinashyati" aadi shabdon dwaara sanshaywad ko agrahya tehraaya he
 But, at the same time, it cannot be denied that blind acceptance of untested traditional beliefs also hinders the development of ideas
 at: kabhi kabhi saamaanya rup se sweekrut tathakthith satyon ko andeh kii drushti se dekhnaa bhi gyanavriddhi ke liye aavashyak ho jaataa he jaisaa bhamtikar shri vachaspati mishra ne kaha he, sanshay jigyaasa ko janm detaa he or jigyaasa to gyaan ke liye vaanchhneeya he hi
 And Kant sir's assertion that Hume's "skepticism woke me from the slumber of ideological stereotypes" proves this truth
 parantu buddhi yaa man ko sanshay rupi rang se purnataya rang lenaa or prayek baat par andeh karnaa thik vaisaa hi he jaisaa haathon main mile na hone par bhi kisi pagal dwaara unka satat or nirantar dhoyaa janaa
