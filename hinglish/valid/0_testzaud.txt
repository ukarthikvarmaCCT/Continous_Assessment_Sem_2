 , Especially for alphabetic writing system
 Although it has been demonstrated that in non-alphabetic scripts, where reading puts less emphasis on acoustic processing and integration of visual-imagery information, dyslexia is associated with reduced activity of the left middle frontal gyrus

 The following theories should not be seen as contradictory, but rather as theories that seek to explain the underlying factors of groups of similar traits with diverse research perspectives and backgrounds
 is siddhant ke anusaar pathan ek aprakritik krity he or hamaare vikasvaadi itihaas main manushya dwaara atyant sankshipt avadhi se hi kiya ja rahaa he 
 pashchimi samaajon dwaara aam janata ke bich pathan ko badhaava dene kaa chalan koi bahut purana nahin he isliye hamaare vyavhaar ko aakaar dene vaali takatein kaaphi kamjor hai
 There is still no access to reading among the general public in many areas of the world
 abhi tak "pathology" kii dislexia main antarnihitata kaa koi sakshya nahin mila he jabaki mastishk kii bhinnataaon or antaron ke kaaphi saboot maujuud hai
 These essential differences carry the burden of artificial work such as reading
 dhwani abhaav siddhant ke anusaar dislexia grast logon main bhaashan dhvaniyon ke pratinidhitiv, bhandaaran or / yaa punarprapti main ek vishisht vikaar maujuud hota he
 This disorder explains the difficulties of reading for those people, on the basis that harmony between grapheme / phoneme is necessary to learn the reading of an axial system
 rapid shravan prasanskaran siddhant dhwani abhaav siddhant kaa ek vaikalpik siddhant he, iske anusaar mukhya abhaav laghu avadhi athwa teji se badalati dhvaniyon ko samajhane main hota he
 Supporting evidence for this theory is found that people with dyslexia prove to be laggards in auditory tasks, including frequency differences and temporal judgment decisions
 drishy siddhant dislexia adhyayan kii ek puraani parampara kaa dyotak he, jiske anusaar yah ek drushti vikaar he jo likhit aksharon yaa shabdon ko samajhane main kathinaayee paidaa karata he
 This may take the form of unstable binocular fixation, substandard variance, and visual crowding enhancement
 drishy siddhant ek dhwani abhaav se inkaar nahin karata he
 Another scenario represents the automatism / cerebellar theory of dyslexia
 yahan jaivik daawa yah he ki dislexia grast logon kaa ceribalam purna rup se kaam nahin karata he or sangyanatmak kathinaaiyaan paidaa hoti hai
 a unified theory attempts to integrate all of the above conclusions
 drishy siddhant kaa ek samanyikaran, magnoselular siddhant ke anusaar magnoselular akarmanyata keval drushti tak simit nahin he balki sabhi tantron main maujuud hoti he 
 The concept of perceptual noise exclusion deficiency is an emerging hypothesis, supporting research showing that people with dyslexia have difficulty performing vision-based tasks such as identifying moving objects in the presence of distracting objects, But this problem disappears when those attention-grabbing items are removed in the laboratory
 shodhakartaaon ne drushti bhed sambandhi kaaryon ke apane in nishkarshon kii upama shravan bhed sambandhi kaaryon ke nishkarshon ke saath kii he
 They insist that the lack of ability to divert attention from the attention-grabbing things, and the ability to separate non-essential information from essential information, is the cause of the symptoms of dyslexia

 Early detection of dyslexia
 Lepanen PH et al, investigated whether infants born in families with a history of developmental dyslexia had a higher probability of developing the disorder
 unhonen paariwarik dislexia kii ucch sambhaavna vaale or bina ucch sambhaavna vaale 6 maheene ke shishuon main mastishk vidyut sakriyan kii jaanch kii jisaki utpatti bhaashan dhvaniyon kii asthaayee sanrachana main parivartan dwaara hoti he or yah bhaashan kaa ek pramukh sankethik lakshan hota he
 High-probability infants differed from the group of controlled infants in both of these things — their initial response to the sound and their response to the detection of stemulus context-dependent changes
 This means that infants from family backgrounds with reading difficulties already process auditory temporal signals of speech sounds differently than other infants before learning to speak
 dislexia kaa aupchaarik nidaan tantrika vigyaani yaa ek shaikshik manovaigyanik jaise yogya peshewar dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Typically, this assessment includes testing of other skills along with reading ability, such as short-term memory and sequencing skills, an early naming test and non-word reading to evaluate sound coding skills
 moolyankan main aamtaur par ek ikyuu test bhi shaamil hota he, seekhney kii shaktiyon or kamajoriyon ke ek profile ko sthapit karne ke liye
 However, recent research has ruled out "a discrepancy between IQ and reading levels across the scale, which is used as a component of disease detection

 Recent developments in neuroimaging and genetics have presented evidence that may possibly detect dyslexia in children even before they learn to read

 These problems may be a shared component of spelling and writing difficulties for people with dyslexia
 dislexia kaa koi ilaaj nahin he lekin uchit shaikshik sahaayta ke saath dislexic vyakti likhnaa padhnaa sikh sakate hai
 For the alphabet writing system, the basic objective is to create awareness in the child about the interrelations of grapheme and phonemes so that with the help of them, he can become proficient in reading and writing

 That's why Jains and Buddhists have called him 'makkhaliputt Goshal'
 sanskrit ke pracheen granthon main unhen ‘muscari goshaal’ bhi kaha gaya he kyonki aajeevak log haath main ‘muscari’ lekar chalaa karte the
 a peculiar story of why Mankhali got its name is prevalent in the Buddhist tradition; According to which Goshalak was a slave

 The village was on high rocky wasteland
 khadgpur ke paas ekmaatr nivas sthaan hijli tha
 Hijli was a small island village on the banks of the Rasulpur River in the delta of the Bay of Bengal
 yah 1687 main ek bandargah shahar main viksit hua
 Hijli was also a province and existed until 1886
 isamen bengal or urisa ke kuch hisson ko shaamil kiya gaya tha
 It had important cities such as Tamluk, Pansura and Debra, with the Kelghai and Haldi rivers in the north to the south, and the Bay of Bengal in the east and the eastern side surrounded by Kharagpur, Keshari, Dantan and Jaleshwar

 The capital of Hijli was in Bahri until 1628 and was later transferred to Hijli
 1754 main hijli praant apane charam par tha or is avadhi ke dauraan behad samrudh tha
 Captain Nicholson was the first English colonist to invade Hijli and capture the port
 1687 main sainikon or yupoton ke saath job charnok ne hijli or mughal rakshakon ko haraakar hijli par kabja kar liya
 After the war with the Mughals, a treaty was signed between Job Charnock and the Mughal emperor
 job charnok dwaara kiye gaye nuksaan se unhen hijli chhodane or uluberia kii ore badhane ke liye majaboor kiya gaya, jabaki mughal samraat ne praant par shashan karnaa jari rakhaa
 From there, they eventually settled in Sutanuti in Kolkata to establish their business in eastern India
 yah bharat main east india company kii shuruyaat thi
 Hijli as we know it today is only a small part of Hijli province, and was built by the British in the 19th century to establish administrative offices 
 yah utsuk he ki aaj ke puure khadgpur divijan main hijli praant ke samaan simaaen hai
 In the 18th century, Khejuri, another port city was established on the banks of the Kokhali River in the delta region
 yah mukhya rup se europea deshon ke saath vyapaar karne ke liye angrejon dwaara sthapit kiya gaya tha
 Khejuri was also an island

 It is also known as the Second War of Kashmir
 bharat or pakistan ke bich jammu or kashmir rajya par adhikaar ke liye bantwaare ke samay se hi vivaad chal rahaa he
 In 1947, the first war between India and Pakistan was also fought for Kashmir
 is ladaai kii shuruuaat pakistan ne apane sainikon ko ghuspaithiyon ke rup main bhej kar is ummid main kii thi ki kashmir kii janata bharat ke khilaaf vidroh kar degi

 On 20 March 1965, Pakistan deliberately started skirmishes in the Rann of Kutch

 This court gave about 900 square kilometers of the Kutch run to Pakistan
 haalanki pakistan kaa daawa 3500 varg kilometre par tha
 
 kuccha ke ran main mili safalataa se utsahit pakistan ke rajanetaaon khaskar tatkaaleen videshmantri zulfikar ali bhutto ne rashtrpati or senadhyaksh general ayub khan par dabaav daalaa ki ve kashmir par hamale kaa aadesh de
 India had lost the war with China at that time and they believed that India was not in a position to wage war at that time
 iske alaava bhutto or unke vichaar se sahamat anya generalo yahya khan or tikka khan kaa yah bhi maananaa tha ki kashmir kii janata bharat se aaazaad hokar pakistan se vilay kii icchhuk he or sainiko ko ghuspaithiyon ke vesh main bhejne par unke samarthan main vidroh kar degi
 At last General Ayub Khan came under pressure and ordered the covert operation of Operation Gibraltar
 is abhiyaan kaa mukhya uddeshy kashmir kii janata main vidroh bhadakaana or bhartiya sanchartantr evam parivahan vyavastha ko nuksaan pahuchana tha
 The infiltrators of Pakistan were quickly identified and instead of rebelling, the public informed the Indian soldiers and the operation completely failed

 The Indian Army, after receiving information from the local population, crossed the Line of Control on 15 August
 
 In the beginning, the Indian Army had good success
 usne topakhane kii madad se teen mahatvapurn pahari thikaano par kabja jamaa liya
 Pakistan made significant progress in the Tithwal, Uri and Poonch regions, but on August 18, the strength of the Pakistani campaign had decreased significantly

 With this occupation Pakistan came into being

 Not only this, Pakistan's command felt that Muzaffarabad, the important city of Pakistani Kashmir, is now going to be captured by Indians
 mujaffarabad par dabaav kam karne ke liye pakistan ne ek nayaa abhiyaan oparation grand slam shuru kiya
 On 1 September 1965, Pakistan, under an operation called Grand Slam, attacked the strategic city of Akhnoor, Jammu and Kashmir, from a strategic drift
 is abhiyaan kaa uddeshy kashmir ghati kaa shesh bharat se sampark tod tha taaki uski rasad or sanchaar vayvastha bhang kar di jaay
 India was not ready for this invasion of Pakistan and Pakistan was getting the benefit of large number of soldiers and better type of tanks
 shuruwat main bharat ko baari kshati uthaani padi is par bhartiya sena ne hawaii hamale kaa upyog kiya iske jawaab main pakistan ne punjab or srinagar ke hawaii thikaano par hamalaa kar diya
 Pakistan was in a very good position during this phase of the war and this unexpected attack caused panic in the Indian camp
 akhnur ke pakistani sena ke haath main jane se bharat ke liye kashmir ghati mehar kaa khatra paidaa ho saktaa tha
 There were two reasons for the failure of the Grand Slam
 The first and the biggest reason was that Pakistan's military command changed its military commander at the mouth of the victory, in such a way, the Pakistani army was delayed by a day and those 24 In the hour, India got an opportunity to bring additional troops and goods to protect Akhnoor
 Local commanders of the Indian Army themselves were aghast why Pakistan gave up such an easy victory
 Used to be
 ek din kii deree ke baavjood bharat ke pashchimi kaman ke sena pramukh yah jaanate the ki pakistan bahut behatar sthiti main he or usko rokane ke liye unhone yah prastaav tatkaaleen senadhyaksh general choudhary ko diya ki punjab seemaa main ek nayaa morcha khol kar lahore par hamalaa kar diya jaay
 General Chaudhary did not agree with this, but the then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shashtri ignored the matter and ordered the attack
 bharat ne 6 sitambar ko antarrashtriya seemaa rekha ko paar kar pashchimi morche par hamalaa kar yuddh kii aadhikarik shuruwat kar di
 On September 6, India's 15th infantry unit faced a major Pakistani attack on the western side of the Ichogil Canal under the leadership of Major General Prasad, a World War II veteran

 Major General Prasad's convoy was also attacked in this attack and had to leave his vehicle and run away
 bharat ne pratinkraman main barki gaanv ke sameep nahar ko paar karne main safalataa arjeet kar lee
 This led the Indian Army to attack Lahore air base and as a result the US appealed for a temporary ceasefire to evacuate its citizens from Lahore
 isi bich pakistan ne lahore par dabaav ko kam karne ke liye khemkaran par hamalaa kar us par kabja kar liya badale main bharat ne bediyaan or uske aas paas ke gaavon par hamalaa kar diya
 The attack on Lahore on 6 September included the first infantry division of the Indian Army along with three tank squads of the second armored subdivision

 The big officers of the Indian Army did not know the ground situation properly, so they ordered the 3 Jats to retreat, fearing that the 3 Jats had also suffered heavy losses, this caused a lot of disappointment to the command officer of the 3 Jats and later on Dograi Then there was a huge cost to capture
 8 disambar 1965 ko 5 maratha lit infentry kaa ek dasta ranneetik rup se mahatvapurn kasbe munaabaav main tainaat rajasthan sainya bal kly majbootee pradaan karne ke liye bheja gaya
 They were ordered to stop the Pakistani army from advancing but they could only protect their outpost amidst heavy bombardment by the artillery of the Pakistani army and aerial and infantry offensive, 5 Maratha soldiers showed great valor
 As a result, today that outpost is known as Maratha Hill
 5 maratha kii madad ke liye bheje gayi 3 gurkha or 954 baari topakhana kaa dasta pakistani vaayu sena ke baari hamale ke kaaran pahuch nahin paaya or rasad le kar barmer se aa rahi tren bhi garda road rail adde ke paas hamale kaa shikaar ho gayi 10 sitambar ko munaabao par pakistan kaa kabja ho gaya
 The events after 9 September crushed the proud pride of the armies of both the countries
 bharat ke 1 bakhtarband khand jise bhartiya sena kii shaan kaha jaataa tha ne sialkot kii disha main hamalaa kar diya
 Pakistan's relatively weak 6 armored division in Chhavinda was defeated badly
 The Indian Army lost about 100 tanks and was forced to retreat
 isse utsahit hokar pakistan kii sena ne bharatiyon par pratiakraman kar diya or bhartiya seemaa main aage ghus aayi
 For their final offensive, Pakistan along with its 1st Armored Division and 11th Infantry Division attacked Khemkaran with the intention of occupying Amritsar
 unke anusaar amritsar ke baad jalandhar or phir raashtrapati ayub khan kii taraf se aaye bayaan ke anusaar dilli aglaa lakshya hota
 As the Pakistani Army moved ahead of Khemkaran , the fourth Mountain Division of Bharata , near the northern village) , 7 Mountain Brigade, 62 Mountain Brigade, Deccan Horse equipped with Sherman Tank, stood for battle with their other division

 According to Air Commander Sajjad Haider, who led Pakistan's No
 19 Squadron in the war - although the Indian Air Force vampire fighter aircraft were older and weaker than the F-86 Saber, Hunter aircraft were superior to them both in strength and speed
 bharatiyon ke anusaar F-86 chote se folland nait ke saamne kamazor tha jiske kaaran in vimaanon ko "saibar naashak" kaha jane laga tha

 The Pakistani Air Force claimed that it dropped 104 aircraft from India and lost 19 of its aircraft, while the Indian Air Force claimed that it dropped 73 aircraft from Pakistan and lost 35 of its aircraft

 Pakistan sources have denied claims of losing only one squadron of the Pakistan Air Force, stating that Pakistan had sought additional aircraft from Indonesia, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and China within 10 days of the initial war

 In the 1965 war, the largest wars of tanks were fought after World War II
 
 At the beginning of the war, the Pakistani Army had both a numerical advantage in tanks, as well as better equipment overall
 Pakistani armour was largely American-made; it consisted mainly of Patton M-47 and M-48 tanks, but also included many M4 Sherman tanks, some M24 Chaffee light tanks and M36 Jackson tank destroyers, equipped with 90 mm guns
 The bulk of India's tank fleet were older M4 Sherman tanks; some were up-gunned with the French high velocity CN 75 50 guns and could hold their own, whilst some older models were still equipped with the inferior 75 mm M3 l / 40 gun
 Besides the M4 tanks, bharat fielded the British-made Centurion Tank Mk 7, with the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, and the AMX-13, PT-76, and M3 Stuart light tanks
 Pakistan fielded a greater number and more modern artillery; its guns out-ranged those of the Indian artillery, according to Pakistan's Major General T
H
 Malik
 At the outbreak of war in 1965, Pakistan had about 15 armored cavalry regiments, each with about 45 tanks in three squadrons
 Besides the Pattons, there were about 200 M4 Shermans re-armed with 76 mm guns, 150 M24 Chaffee light tank and a few independent squadrons of M36B1 tank destroyers
 Most of these regiments served in Pakistan's two armored divisions, the 1st and 6th armored divisions - the latter being in the process of formation
 The Indian Army of the time possessed 17 cavalry regiments, and in the 1950s had begun modernizing them by the acquisition of 164 AMX-13 light tanks and 188 Centurions
 The remainder of the cavalry units were equipped with M4 Shermans and a small number of M3A3 Stuart light tanks
 India had only a single armoured division, the 1st 'black Elephant' Armoured Division, also called 'fakhr-i-hind', which consisted of the 17th Cavalry, the 4th Hodson's Horse, the 16th 'black Elephant' Cavalry, the 7th Light Cavalry, the 2nd Lancers, the 18th Cavalry and the 62nd Cavalry, the two first named being equipped with Centurions
 There was also the 2nd Independent Armoured Brigade, one of whose three regiments, the 3rd Cavalry, was also equipped with Centurions
 Despite the qualitative and numerical superiority of Pakistani armor, Pakistan was outfought on the battlefield by India, which made progress into the lahore-sialkot sector, whilst halting Pakistan's counteroffensive on Amritsar 
; They were sometimes employed in a faulty manner, such as charging prepared defenses during the defeat of Pakistan's 1st Armored Division at Assal Uttar
 Although India's tank formations experienced same results, bharat's attack at the Battle of Chawinda, led by its 1st Armored Division and supporting units, was brought to a grinding halt by the newly raised 6th Armoured Division in the Chawinda sector
 The Indians lost 120 tanks at Chawinda
 One true winner to emerge was India's Centurion battle tank, with its 105 mm gun and heavy armour, which proved superior to the overly complex Pattons and their exaggerated reputations
 However, in the Sialkot sector outnumbered Pattons performed exceedingly well in the hands of the 25th Cavalry and other regiments of the 6th Armoured Division, which exacted a disproportionately heavy toll of Centurions from the Poona Horse and Hodson's Horse
 The Indian Army has made much of the fact that some of its Centurions survived repeated hits; yet have failed to point out that the majority of tanks in the Sialkot sector were Shermans whose guns were inadequate even in 1944
 Neither the Indian nor Pakistani Army showed any great facility in the use of armoured formations in offensive operations, whether the Pakistani 1st Armoured Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armoured Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armoured Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes The navies of India and Pakistan did not play a prominent role in the war of 1965, although Pakistani accounts dispute this
 On September 7, a flotilla of the Pakistani Navy carried out a small scale bombardment of the Indian coastal town and radar station of Dwarka, which was 200 miles south of the Pakistani port of Karachi
 Codenamed Operation Dwarka, it did not fulfill its primary objective of disabling the radar station and there was no immediate retaliatory response from India
 Later, some of the Indian fleet sailed from Bombay to Dwarka to patrol the area and deter further bombardment
 Foreign authors have noted that the "insignificant bombardment" of the town was a "limited engagement, with no strategic value
" According to some Pakistani sources, one submarine, PNS Ghazi, kept the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant besieged in Bombay throughout the war
 Indian sources claim that it was not their intention to get into a naval conflict with Pakistan, and wished to restrict the war to a land-based conflict
 Moreover, they note that the Vikrant was in dry dock in the process of refitting
 Some Pakistani defence writers have also discounted claims that the Indian Navy was bottled up in Bombay by a single submarine, instead stating that 75% of the Indian Navy was under maintenance in harbour
 The Pakistan Army launched a number of covert operations to infiltrate and sabotage Indian airbases
 On September 7, 1965, the Special Services Group commandos were parachuted into enemy territory
 According to Chief of Army Staff General Musa Khan, about 135 commandos were airdropped at three Indian airfields
 The daring attempt proved to be an "unmitigated disaster"
 Only 22 commandos returned to Pakistan as planned, 93 were taken prisoner, and 20 were killed in encounters with the army, police or civilians the reason for the failure of the commando mission is attributed to the failure to provide maps, proper briefings and adequate planning or preparation Despite failing to sabotage the airfields, Pakistan sources claim that the commando mission affected some planned Indian operations
 As the Indian 14th Infantry Division was diverted to hunt for paratroopers, the Pakistan Air Force found the road filled with transport, and destroyed many vehicles
 India responded to the covert activity by announcing rewards for captured Pakistani spies or paratroopers
 Meanwhile, in Pakistan, rumors spread that India had retaliated with its own covert operations, sending commandos deep into Pakistan territory, but these rumors were later determined to be unfounded
 apni or duusare kii haani ke bare main bharat or pakistan donon ne bilkul bemail daawey kiye
 The brief table of claims of the two countries is as follows There have been several neutral assessments of the losses incurred by both India and Pakistan during the war
 Most of these assessments agree that India had a upper hand over Pakistan when ceasefire was declared
 Some of the neutral assessments are mentioned below — The war was militarily inconclusive; Each side held prisoners and some territory belonging to the other
 Losses were relatively heavy — on the Pakistani side, twenty aircraft, 200 tanks, and 3,800 troops
 Pakistan's army had been able to withstand Indian pressure, but a continuation of the fighting would only have led to further losses and ultimate defeat for Pakistan
 Most Pakistanis, schooled in the belief of their own martial prowess, refused to accept the possibility of their country's military defeat by "hindu India" and were, instead, quick to blame their failure to attain their military aims on what they considered to be the ineptitude of Ayub Khan and his government
 Severely mauled by the larger Indian armed forces, Pakistan could continue the fight only by teaming up with Red China and turning its back on the U
N
 The invading Indian forces outfought their Pakistani counterparts and halted their attack on the outskirts of Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city
 By the time United Nations intervened on September 22, Pakistan had suffered a clear defeat
 The superior Indian forces, however, won a decisive victory and the army could have even marched on into Pakistani territory had external pressure not forced both combatants to cease their war efforts
 In three weeks the second indo-pak War ended in what appeared to be a draw when the embargo placed by Washington on US ammunition and replacements for both armies forced cessation of conflict before either side won a clear victory
 India, however, was in a position to inflict grave damage to, if not capture, Pakistan's capital of the Punjab when the cease-fire was called, and controlled Kashmir's strategic uri-poonch bulge, much to Ayub's chagrin
 India won the war
 It gained 1,840 square kilometers of Pakistani territory: 640 square kilometers in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan's portion of the state; 460 square kilometers of the Sailkot sector; 380 square kilometers far to the south of Sindh; and most critical, 360 square kilometers on the Lahore front
 Pakistan took 540 square kilometers of Indian territory: 490 square kilometers in the Chhamb sector and 50 square kilometers around Khem Karan
these are not correct pls review Although both sides lost heavily in men and material, and neither gained a decisive military advantage, India had the better of the war
 New Delhi achieved its basic goal of thwarting Pakistan's attempt to seize Kashmir by force
 Pakistan gained nothing from a conflict which it had instigated
 India's strategic aims were modest – it aimed to deny Pakistani Army victory, although it ended up in possession of 720 varg mile of Pakistani territory for the loss of just 220 varg mile of its own
 a brief but furious 1965 war with India began with a covert Pakistani thrust across the Kashmiri cease-fire line and ended up with the city of Lahore threatened with encirclement by Indian Army
 Another un-sponsored cease-fire left borders unchanged, but Pakistan's vulnerability had again been exposed
 The 1965 indo-pak war lasted barely a month
 Pakistan made gains in the Rajasthan desert but its main push against India's jammu-srinagar road link was repulsed and Indian tanks advanced to within a sight of Lahore
 Both sides claimed victory but India had most to celebrate
 Again India appeared, logistically at least, to be in a superior position but neither side was able to mobilize enough strength to gain a decisive victory
 By just the end of the week, in fact, it was clear that the Pakistanis were more than holding their own
 The United States and the Soviet Union used important diplomatic equipment to prevent further escalation in conflict between the two South Asian countries

 With declining stockpiles of ammunition, Pakistani leaders feared the war tilting in India's favor
 Therefore, they quickly accepted the ceasefire in Tashkent
 Despite strong opposition from Indian military leaders, India budged to growing international diplomatic pressure and accepted the ceasefire
 On September 22, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that called for an unconditional ceasefire from both nations
 The war ended the following day
 India's Prime Minister, Shastri, suffered a fatal heart attack soon after the declaration of the ceasefire
 As a consequence, the public outcry in India against the ceasefire declaration transformed into a wave of sympathy for the ruling Indian National Congress
 The ceasefire was criticized by many Pakistanis who, relying on fabricated official reports and the controlled Pakistani press, believed that the leadership had surrendered military gains
 The protests led to student riots
 Pakistan State's reports had suggested that their military was performing admirably in the war – which they incorrectly blamed as being initiated by India – and thus the Tashkent Declaration was seen as having forfeited the gains
 Some recent books written by Pakistani authors, including one by ex-isi chief titled "the Myth of 1965 Victory", allegedly exposed Pakistani fabrications about the war, but all copies of the book were bought by Pakistan Army to prevent publication because the topic was "too sensitive"
 India and Pakistan accused each other of ceasefire violations; India charged Pakistan with 585 violations in 34 days, while Pakistan countered with accusations of 450 incidents by India
 In addition to the expected exchange of small arms and artillery fire, India reported that Pakistan utilized the ceasefire to capture the Indian village of Chananwalla in the Fazilka sector
 This village was recaptured by Indian troops on 25 December
 On October 10, a B-57 Canberra on loan to the PAF was damaged by 3 SA-2 missiles fired from the IAF base at Ambala
 a Pakistani Army Auster was shot down on 16 December killing one Pakistani Army captain and on 2 February 1967, an AOP was shot down by IAF Hunters
 The ceasefire remained in effect until the start of the indo-pakistani War of 1971
 Due to many strategic mistakes made by both India and Pakistan, this war came to a disastrous situation
 Indian military intelligence gave no warning of the impending Pakistan invasion
 The Indian Army failed to recognize the presence of heavy Pakistani artillery and armaments in Chumb and suffered significant losses as a result
 The "official History of the 1965 War", drafted by the Ministry of Defense of India in 1992, was a long suppressed document that revealed other miscalculations
 According to the document, on September 22 when the Security Council was pressing for a ceasefire, the Indian Prime Minister asked commanding Gen
 Chaudhuri if India could possibly win the war, were he to delay accepting the ceasefire
 The general replied that most of India's frontline ammunition had been used up and the Indian Army had suffered considerable tank losses
 It was determined later that only 14% of India's frontline ammunition had been fired and India held twice the number of tanks as Pakistan
 By this time, the Pakistani Army had used close to 80% of its ammunition
 Air Chief Marshal P
C
 Lal, who was the Vice Chief of Air Staff during the conflict, points to the lack of coordination between the IAF and the Indian army
 Neither side revealed its battle plans to the other
 The battle plans drafted by the Ministry of Defence and General Chaudhari, did not specify a role for the Indian Air Force in the order of battle
 This attitude of Gen
 Chaudhari was referred to by ACM Lal as the "supremo Syndrome", a patronizing attitude sometimes held by the Indian army towards the other branches of the Indian Military
 The Pakistani Army's failures started with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people, given the opportunity provided by the Pakistani advance, would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive surrender of Kashmir
 The Kashmiri people, however, did not revolt
 Instead, the Indian Army was provided with enough information to learn of Operation Gibraltar and the fact that the Army was battling not insurgents, as they had initially supposed, but Pakistani Army regulars
 The Pakistani Army also failed to recognize that the Indian policy makers would order an attack on the southern sector in order to open a second theater of conflict
 Pakistan was forced to dedicate troops to the southern sector to protect Sialkot and Lahore instead using them to support penetrating into Kashmir
 "operation Grand Slam", which was launched by Pakistan to capture Akhnoor, a town north-east of Jammu and a key region for communications between Kashmir and the rest of India, was also a failure
 Many Pakistani commentators criticized the Ayub Khan administration for being indecisive during Operation Grand Slam
 These critics claim that the operation failed because Ayub Khan knew the importance of Akhnur to India and did not want to capture it and drive the two nations into an all-out war
 Despite progress being made in Akhnur, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik and replaced him with Gen
 Yahya Khan
 a 24-hour lull ensued the replacement, which allowed the Indian Army to regroup in Akhnur and successfully oppose a lackluster attack headed by General Yahya Khan
 " Some authors have noted that Pakistan might have been emboldened by a war game – conducted in March 1965, at the Institute of Defence Analysis, USA
 The exercise concluded that, in the event of a war with India, Pakistan would win
 Other authors like Stephen Philip Cohen, have consistently commented that the Pakistan Army had "acquired an exaggerated view of the weakness of both India and the Indian military


 the 1965 war was a shock"
 Pakistani Air Marshal and Commander in Chief of PAF during the war, Noor Khan, later said thgnf fhfhfffhn Army, and not India, should be blamed for starting the war
 However propaganda in Pakistan about the war continued; The war was not rationally analyzed in Pakistan, with most of the blame being heaped on the leadership and little importance given to intelligence failures that persisted until the debacle of the 1971 war, when then East Pakistan was invaded by India and seceded from West Pakistan, leading to the creation of Bangladesh
 hghginj u xxrep 4 j fhffuhhh Pakistan and the United States had signed an Agreement of Cooperation in 1959 under which the United States agreed to take "appropriate action, including the use of armed forces" in order to assist the Government of Pakistan at its request
 However, following the start of the 1965 war, the United States was of the view that the conflict was largely Pakistan's fault and therefore, it cut all military supplies to the country
 However, Pakistan did receive significant support from Iran, Indonesia and People's Republic of China
 Both before and during the war, the People's Republic of China had been a major military associate of Pakistan and had invariably admonished India, with whom it had fought a war in 1962
 There were also reports of Chinese troop movements on the Indian border to support Pakistan As such, India agreed to the UN mandate in order to avoid a war on both borders
 India's participation in the non-aligned Movement yielded little support from its members
 Despite close relations between with India, the Soviet Union was more neutral than most other nations during the war and even invited both nations to talks that it would host in Tashkent
 Despite the declaration of a ceasefire, India was perceived as the victor due to its success in halting the Pakistan-backed insurgency in Kashmir
 In its October 1965 issue, the TIME magazine quoted a Western official assessing the consequences of the war - Now it's apparent to everybody that India is going to emerge as an Asian power in its own right
 In light of the failures of the sino-indian War, the outcome of the 1965 war was viewed as a "politico-strategic" victory in India
 The Indian premier, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was hailed as a national hero in India
 While the overall performance of the Indian military was praised, military leaders were criticized for their failure to effectively deploy India's superior armed forces so as to achieve a decisive victory over Pakistan
 In his book "war in the modern world since 1815", noted war historian Jeremy Black said that though Pakistan "lost heavily" during the 1965 war, bharat's hasty decision to call for negotiations prevented further considerable damage to the Pakistan Armed Forces
 He elaborates — India's chief of army staff urged negotiations on the ground that they were running out ammunition and their number of tanks had become seriously depleted
 In fact, the army had used less than 15% of its ammunition compared to Pakistan, which had consumed closer to 80 percent and India had double the number of serviceable tanks
 As a consequence, bharat focussed on enhancing communication and coordination within and among the triservices of the Indian Armed Forces
 Partly as a result of the inefficient information gathering preceding the war, bharat established the Research and Analysis Wing for external espionage and intelligence
 Major improvements were also made in command and control to address various shortcomings and the positive impact of these changes was clearly visible during the indo-pakistani War of 1971 when India achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan within two weeks
 China's repeated threats to intervene in the conflict in support of Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision to develop nuclear weapons
 Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict which irked India
 At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India
 These developments led to a significant change in India's foreign policy - India, which had previously championed the cause of non-alignment, distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union
 By the end of 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India
 From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India's arms imports were from the Soviet Union
 After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far
 At the conclusion of the war, many Pakistanis considered the performance of their military to be positive
 September 6 is celebrated as 'defence Day' in Pakistan, in commemoration of the successful defence of Lahore against the Indian army
 The performance of the Pakistani Air Force, in particular, was praised
 However, the Pakistani government was accused by foreign analysts of spreading disinformation among its citizens regarding the actual consequences of the war
 In his book "mainsprings of Indian and Pakistani foreign policies", SM Burke writes - After the indo-pakistani war of 1965 the balance of military power had decisively shifted in favor of India
 Pakistan had found it difficult to replace the heavy equipment lost during that conflict while her adversary, despite her economic and political problems, had been determinedly building up her strength
 Most observers agree that the myth of a mobile, hard hitting Pakistan Army was badly dented in the war, as critical breakthroughs were not made
 Several Pakistani writers criticized the military's ill-founded belief that their "martial race" of soldiers could defeat "hindu India" in the war
 Rasul Bux Rais, a Pakistani political analyst wrote - The 1965 war with India proved that Pakistan could neither break the formidable Indian defenses in a blitzkrieg fashion nor could she sustain an all-out conflict for long
 Moreover, Pakistan had lost more ground than it had gained during the war and, more importantly, failed to achieve its goal of occupying Kashmir; This result has been viewed by many impartial observers as a defeat for Pakistan
 Many high ranking Pakistani officials and military experts later criticized the faulty planning of Operation Gibraltar that ultimately led to the war
 The Tashkent declaration was also criticized in Pakistan, though few citizens realised the gravity of the situation that existed at the end of the war
 Political leaders were also criticized
 Following the advice of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's foreign minister, Ayub Khan had raised very high expectations among the people of Pakistan about the superiority – if not invincibility – of its armed forces, but Pakistan's inability to attain its military aims during the war, created a political liability for Ayub
 The defeat of its Kashmiri ambitions in the war led to the army's invincibility being challenged by an increasingly vocal opposition
 One of the most far reaching consequences of the war was the wide-scale economic slowdown in Pakistan
 The cost of the 1965 war put an end to the impressive period economic growth Pakistan had experienced during the early 1960s
 Between 1964 and 1966, Pakistan's defense spending rose from 4
82% to 9
86% of GDP, putting tremendous strain on Pakistan's economy
 By 1970–71, defense spending comprised a whopping 55
66% of government advisory
 Pakistan was surprised by the lack of support by the United States, an ally with whom the country had signed an Agreement of Cooperation
 USA declared its neutrality in the war by cutting off military supplies to both sides, leading Islamabad to believe that they were "betrayed" by the United States
 After the war, Pakistan would increasingly look towards China as a major source of military hardware and political support
 Another negative consequence of the war was the growing resentment against the Pakistani government in East Pakistan, particularly for West Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir
 Bengali leaders accused the central government of not providing adequate security for East Pakistan during the conflict, even though large sums of money were taken from the east to finance the war for Kashmir
 In fact, despite some Pakistan Air Force attacks being launched from bases in East Pakistan during the war, India did not retaliate in that sector, although East Pakistan was defended only by an understrenghted infantry division, sixteen planes and no tanks
 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was critical of the disparity in military resources deployed in East and West Pakistan, calling for greater autonomy for East Pakistan, saanchaa:pakistani sena The Act of Settlement was an Act passed by the Parliament of England in 1701, which was passed to solve the succession problem on the English and Irish crowns

 par yah abhi rahasy hi he ki kab or kaise kuch ansh jayaditya ke or kuch vaaman ke lekar yah kashika bani
 Yet it is certified that this integration of vrittis had already taken place before Vikram Samvat 700
