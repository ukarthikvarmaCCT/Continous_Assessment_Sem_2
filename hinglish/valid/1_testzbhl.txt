 " carol ne david goldman se vivaah kiya, jo ek rashtriya theatre nirdeshak or aalochak he
 Although she did not have children of her own, her husband has two grown children, whose children call Dweck a "grandmother"
 vah bataati he ki poton ke paas vikaas kii maansikta hai or kahati hai, "unke mata-pita ne bahut acha kaam kiya he!" Dweck was always interested in people and learned why they do it
 mahavidhyalay main yah ruchi gahari hui
 He has said: "psychology has compounded my many interests: i love the scientific method - putting my ideas to the test - and i liked the human subject of psychology
 " His first job after graduate school was at the University of Illinois

 vah vyaktitv or saamaajik vikaas ke saath-saath prerana ke paathyakram bhi padhaati he
 His major contribution to social psychology relates to the underlying principles of intelligence
 The same is also reported in his book Mentalism: The New Psychology of Success
 According to Dweck, individuals can be placed on a continuum according to their ideas of absolute potential

 yah vifaltaa kii unki pratikriya main vishesh rup se spasht he
 Individuals with a fixed mindset are afraid of failure because it is a negative statement on their basic abilities, whereas a growth mindset does not cause fear in the minds or minds of individuals because they feel that their performance can be improved and learn from failure Can
 ye donon maansikta kisi vyakti ke jivan ke sabhi pahaluon main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaati hai
 Dweck argues that a growth mindset will help a person to live a less stressful and more successful life

 In other words, it is possible to encourage students, for example, to persist despite failing by encouraging them to think about learning a certain way

 Can inspire you to live
 is tarah, unke bacchon ko prashansa kaa das nahin bananaa hoga
 They will have the way of a lifetime to build and repair their confidence
 " dwek budhimatta kii stuti ke khataron kii chetavanee detaa he kyonki yah ek nishchit maansikta main bacchon ko daalata he, or ve chunauti nahin lenaa chahenge kyonki ve bevakoof nahin dikhnaa chaahate hai yaa galati nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 He says, "praising children's intelligence hurts motivation and it hurts performance
 " As explained by Dweck, this method reveals a new revolutionary approach to the upbringing of children - we must applaud the effort and not the talent; That we should teach children to look at learning opportunities rather than threats to challenges; And we should emphasize how capabilities can be changed
 duniya bhar ke prayogon se pataa chalaa he ki jab mata-pita or shikshak is drushtikon ko apana karte hai, or isko chipakate hai, to parinaam asaadhaaran hote hai
 Carol Dweck holds a teaching presence at Stanford as a psychology professor for the 2017–18 school year, teaching developmental psychology, self-theory, and independent studies

 It is hoped that this will attract even more young scholars in development to study the psychology of motivation
 " Most recently, Carol Dweck received the largest prize in educational aspects, $ 3
8 million, to continue her research on learning ability
 dwek ne ek bayaan main kaha, "main is adbhut puraskaar ke udghaatankarta praapt karne ke liye romanchit or sammanit hoon
 This will allow us to take our work forward and continue anew - helping to develop more effective interventions for students to use more effective material in teacher classrooms

 In 1861, an English scientist, Thomas Graham, observed that albumin, glue, glue, demand, silicic acid, and other similar substances were not able to filter through the pores of the bio-membrane when dissolved in water
 iske vipareet sharkara, uria, sodium, chloride ityadi ke jalavilayan jaev jhilli ke chhidron se nikal jate hai
 The former type is found in most of the amorphous form on the basis of this property
 Soluble substances in water are divided into two classes: those substances which were crystalline and after solution in water can be released from the pores of the bio-membranes
 , Called crystalloids, and others, which were amorphous and could not be able to come out of the pores of the bio-membrane when dissolved in water, were called kalil
 kintu ab yah siddh ho gaya ki sharkara or sodium chloride aadi crystalia padaarth bhi upyukt madhyam main kalil ke rup main praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 In the foliage, the fissile particles are scattered in a continuous medium

 The first class has metallic types of plumes, such as gold plumes etc
, and the second class has protein types of plumes, such as gelatin
 inke vishesh gun nimnlikhit hai : The words which have special use for both these types of plumes are hydrologist and water lover
 inhen angreji main krmanusaar lyophobic or lyophilic bhi kaha jaataa he
 This classification cannot be said to be entirely satisfactory, since some properties of certain clades are intermediate to the unreduced properties of both extreme classes
 is prakaar ke jalakalilon main kuch dhatviya oxiden yaa hydroxiden, kuch aviley fasphet, molibdet, tungstate ityadi hai
 Some people divide the Kalils into two classes of Alambabh and Payasabha

 There are several methods used to construct the drainage systems
 in vidhiyon ko do virgon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he– ekikaran or vighatan
 In the first method, molecularly sized particles are gradually elongated until they attain the size of the buds, and their acceleration is accelerated by the presence of a stabilizing material, or by the addition of a water-soluble particle, Is controlled
 is vidhi se kai dhaatuen, hydraxiden, aviley lavan tathaa photography main kaam aanevaali rajat helliden kalilavastha main nirmit kii gai hai
 In the second method, larger particles are divided into smaller particles
 bradig vidhi main dhaatuon ke bade tukdon ko vidyut arq kii sahaayta se todakar dhatviya kalil praapt kiye jate hai
 For this reason this method is called the method of dissolution, but in reality these buds are also made by the method of integration
