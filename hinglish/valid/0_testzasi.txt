 The first writers of Naya Kannada, magazine editor, Prakashki, Mudraki, known as Tirumalamba women, tried day and night for salvation
 He was born on 25 March 1887 in Nanjangud

 unke gaanv kaa bhashaa kannada ke bare main unako vishesh prem tha
 unako kannada, tamil ke alawa telegu bhashaa bhi aati thi
 According to the child marriage prevalent in his time, Tirumalamba was also married at the tenth age
 But in the fourteenth year, he got husbandhood
 unke peetaa venkat krishna ayyangar sahitya priy hone ke alaava vishaal manobhaav ke the, unhone padivooyi shrest rachnowo ko apane beti ko bhi bent main de die

 Tirumalamba started teaching lessons for children in his spare time, turning his house into a school
 Gradually, in addition to the children around, the women also finished their work early and started learning from Tirumalamba
 In this way his house name was known as "mother Temple"
 These days, Tirumalamba has started a magazine called "sanmargadarshini" for her favorite student
 unke adhyayan main samay main unako pasand aanevaale ke bare main likhnaa thirumalamba kii ek rudi thi
 is chintan vyapti main unka lekhan naatak, upanyaas, kahania, bhakthi geet main vistaar hone laga
 unke lekhano ke liye "matra mandir" ke sabiko kii kami nahin thi
 is prakaar adhik se adhik vishyon ko apane sabiko dilaane ke vaaste zyada se zyada likhane lage
 Once a story was organized in the Mysore magazine named 'madhura Vani', at a time when Tirumalamba sold one of her stories
 While searching for the author of such a beautiful story, the editor of "madhura Vani" himself, Mr
 K
K
 Hanuman comes to Tirumalamba's house
 He found a barn full of many writings on him
 Influenced by the writing of "vidya Kartavya", he published that writing in his "madhura Vani"
 Due to the lack of customs at that time, Tirumalamba received many perforations, which he did not think about, worked confidently, believing his own thinking
 For this, his parents got blessings and support
 Later on, Tirumalamba started a publishing house named "sati Hitaishini"
 "sati hitaishini" prakaashan ghar se 1913 main prakat huwa tiramalamb kii pratham upanyaas kaa naam tha, "susheel"

 Such was the best sentiment of Tirumalamba
 He published eleven books in total like "yutlalat", "harien"
 He wrote twenty-eight writings, including fiction, novel, short novels, detective novels, essays, poetry, plays
 His last novel was "manimala" written in 1939
 
 aage, thirumalamba ne "karnataka nandini" naam kaa maas patrika shuru kiya
 thirumalamba hameshaa kehete the kii "main vidya kii gand ko na jaananevaali, alpmati evam saamaanya stri hoon
 nav naagarikta ke bare main yaa budhdi mujhe main nahin he
 phir bhi hamaare behno ko apane haath se honevaali madad karnaa main kabhi bhi nahin chhoduungi"

 is patrika ko ek lambey samay tak chalane main sakasham na hone ke kaaran band karnaa pad
 Meanwhile, Tirumalamba was struck by the death of his father
 isliye unhone likhnaa chhodkar adhik or adhik antarmukhi ho gaye or aadyatma kii taraf dhyaan diya
 Later, instead of writing, his mind went silent

 Antioxidants or antibodies are compounds that are mixed with small amounts of other substances to inhibit their reaction with the oxygen of the atmosphere
 in yogicon ko oxikaran nirodhak tathaa sthayeekari bhi kehete hai tathaa sthayeekari bhi kehete hai
 That is, anti-oxidants are molecules that protect other molecules from oxidation or slow down the oxidation process of other molecules
 oxikaran ek prakaar kii rasinic kriya he jiske dwaara kisi padaarth se electron yaa hydrogen oxikaarak agent ko sthanantarit ho jate hai
 Antioxidants are used in medical science and industry

 These antioxidants do not allow the formation of viscosity-causing substances that are harmful to the internal combustion engine
 praayah pratisthapit phenol evam fenilanediamine ke vyutpann is kaam ke liye prayukt hote hai
 Many compounds are automatically oxidized by oxygen in the air when they are kept open

 This confirms the oxidation reaction process based on the chain reaction

 Oxidation reactions can produce free radicals, which initiate chain reactions that damage cells

 hindu dharm ke siddhanth ke kuch mukhya bindu: According to Hindu scripture Upanishads, Brahma is the ultimate element
 wo hi jagat kaa saar he, jagat kii aatma he
 He is the basis of the world
 usee se vishwa kii utpatti hoti he or vishwa nasht hone par usee main villin ho jaataa he
 Brahm is one and only one
 wo vishwathit bhi he or vishwa ke pare bhi
 He is the ultimate truth, omnipotent and omniscient
 wo kalathit, nity or shaashvat he
 That is the ultimate knowledge
 brahm ke do rup hai : parabrahm or aparabrahm
 Parbrahma is infinite, eternal and devoid of body
 wo sabhi gunon se bhi pare he, par usamen anant satya, anant chit or anant anand he
 Brahma is not worshiped, because it is beyond worship and indescribable
 uskaa dhyaan kiya jaataa he
 Pranava is the 8 Brahmavakya, which all Hindus consider to be the ultimate holy word
 hindu yah maanate hai ki om kii dhwani puure brahmand main gunj rahi he
 It is heard when deep into meditation
 brahm kii pariklpana veydant darshan kaa kendriya stambh he or hindu dharm kii vishwa ko anupam dein he
 What is the relation between Brahma and God, the thinking of Hindu philosophy is different
 advait veydant ke anusaar jab maanav brahm ko apane man se jaanane kii koshish karata he, tab brahm ishwar ho jaataa he, kyonki maanav maaya naam kii ek jaadui shakti ke vash main rahata he
 That is, when the shadow of Brahma falls in the mirror of Maya, then the image of Brahma is shown to us as God
 ishwar apni isi jaadui shakti "maaya" se vishwa kii sristi karata he or us par shashan karata he
 Although God is with a negative force in this situation, Maya is not able to impress him, just as a magician is not surprised by his own magic
 maaya ishwar kii daasi he, parantu ham jeevon kii swamini he
 Although God is formless, but because of Maya, he can appear to us as many gods
 iske vipareet vaishnav maton or darshanon main mana jaataa he ki ishwar or brahm main koi fark nahin he--or vishnu hi ishwar hai
 According to the Nyaya, Vaishika and Yoga philosophies, God is the supreme and supreme soul, who is enlightened and is the creator and ruler of the world
 jo bhi ho, baaki baaten sabhi hindu maanate hai : ishwar ek or keval ek he
 It is both universal and reliable
 beshak, ishwar sagun he
 He is self-centered and the cause of the world
 wo puja or upasna kaa vishay he
 He is complete, eternal, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent
 wo raag-dwesh se pare he, par apane bhakton se prem karata he or unpar krupa karata he
 Without his will, not even a single leaf can move in this world
 wo vishwa kii naitik vyavastha ko kaayam rakhata he or jeevon ko unke karmon ke anusaar sukh-dukh pradaan karata he
 According to Srimad Bhagavadgita, he comes from time to time in the form of an avatar on the earth after a moral collapse in the world
 ishwar ke anya naam hai : parameshwar, paramatma, vidhaataa, bhagwaan 
 This god is called Musalman Allah, God, Christian God and Jews Yahweh
 hindu dharm main kai devtaa hai, jinako angrezi main galat rup se "gods" kaha jaataa he
 There can be three opinions about who these deities are: ek baat or kahi ja sakati he ki zyaadaatar vaishnav or shaiva darshan pehle do vichaaron ko sammilit rup se maanate hai
 For example, Krishna is considered to be the God under whom all other gods and goddesses are present and at the same time, all the gods and goddesses are considered to be the form of Krishna

 Whatever be the thinking, these deities are integral to the colorful Hindu culture
