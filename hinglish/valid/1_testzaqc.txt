amarkosh main vaarangana, ganika or veshya samanaarthi kahe gaye hai
 But Medhatithi has given two forms of prostitutes
 ek to aisi stri jo sambhog kii ichha se anek vyaktiyon ke prati anurakt hoti he
 He named it Punshli
 duusari vah jo sajadhjkar yuvakon ko vasheebhoot to karti he kintu hriday main sambhog kii ichha nahin rakhti or dhan praapt hone par hi sambhog ke liye tatpar hoti he
 She has called such a woman a courtesan
 vastut: aisi stri veshya kahi jaati thi, ganika nahin
 This is evident from the two distinctions of Abhisarika called Vashyabhisarika and Ganikabhisarika
 veshya keval roopajiva or andhak nayak ko bhi tan vikray karanevaali thi
 She is not counted in the heroine
 ganika veshya or vaarangana kii apeksha shreshth samajhi jaati thi
 In fact, the Kalavati woman was called a female singer, she used to sing dance in the royal court in the ancient times and she used to get a thousand pension for this work
 vah raja ke singhasanacin par rahane athwa palki main baithne ke samay us par pankhaa jhalti thi
 Thus the courtesan was a Rajsevika
 use raaj darbar main sammaan praapt tha, aisa naatyashaastra ke prachur ullekhon se prakat hota he
 Bharata has mentioned his qualities in this way - lalitvistaar main ek rajkumaari ko ganika ke samaan shastrajna kaha gaya he
 It appears that the courtesan was a scholar of poetry
 ganikaputree ko nagarputron ke saath baithkar vidyadhyayan karne kaa adhikaar praapt tha
 Among the republics, the court was considered to be the property of the entire nation, Kiwa Gan
 buddha sahitya main uskaa yahi rup praapt hota he
 In Sanskrit drama, she is called 'nagarshree'
 mrichctic kii nayika vasantsena ganika thi
 It shows respect for him
 vaishali kii anbpali basantsena kii tarah hi nagar ke abhimaan kii vastu thi
 After the decline of the republic, the influence of the empire continued to differentiate between the queen and the wargana
 ganika ko vaarangana se hey mana jane laga

 vaidic sanskrit main likhe chaar veda isaki dharmik kitaaben hai
 According to Hindu belief, the mantras of Rigveda and other Vedas were revealed to the sages by God
 isliye vedon ko 'shruti' kaha jaataa he, jabaki shrutigranthuke anusharan kar vedadwara rachaa gaya vedangadi sutara granth smriti kehalaata he

 The four criteria of religion are: veda chaar hai
 There are four divisions of every Veda: Samhita, Brahmin, Aranyaka and Upanishadindhu religion is the basic basis of Veda
 veda kaa arth he gyaan
 The word ‘veda’ is derived from the ‘vid’ metal of Sanskrit
 'vid' yani jaananaa
 Veda is also known as 'shruti'
 'shru' dhaatu se 'shruti' shabd bana he
 'shru' means listening
 kehete hai ki rishiyon ko antaratma main paramatma ke paas se aata gyaan sunai padaa
 The Vedas are four: Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda
 chaaron vedon main kul milakar 20389 mantra hai
 In ancient times, people in the country of India who were knowledgeable, had ethics, whose heart was generous, whose views were high, people used to call them 'sages'
 'sada jivan, ucch vichaar' unka adarsh tha
 He used to reflect on esoteric themes of religion, lead a simple and pious life and show the right path to the society
 vaidic sahitya in rishiyon kii hi pavitra dharohar he
 It used to inspire people even 5000 years ago and still gets today
 vedon main hamen bahut se devataaon kii stuti or prarthana ke mantra milte hai
 The main deities among them are: kabhi to ham sharir ko manushya kehete hai, kabhi uski aatma ko
 Similarly, Vedic sages also prayed to the gods in two forms
 kabhi jad padaarth ke rup main, kabhi us jad ke bheetar rahane vaale chetan parampara ke rup main
 For example, once the word 'surya' was used, they meant that brightly shining shell, which we call as 'surya'
 kabhi 'surya' se unka aashay hota tha, surya ke rup main prakaashmaan paramatma se
 The sages believed that the same great power was scattered as many gods
 usee kii ve stuti karte the, usee kii prarthana
 He used to worship him only
 usee ko prasann karne ke liye ve yajna karte the
 The mantras of Veda are full of beauty

 Whoever hears the recitation of the recitation, becomes enchanted
 itnaa hi nahin, richaon main jo arth bharaa he, vah to usase bhi sundar he
 The expressions which are filled in them, are going to elevate the human being

 There are four divisions under the Veda: 1) Samhita, 2) Brahmin, 3) Aranyaka and 4) Upanishads
 vedon ke mul paath ko samhita kehete hai
 These are different texts of the four Vedas
 chaaron vedon kii kai shakhaaen ho chuki hai or un sabhi shakhaon ke apane-apane brahman, aaranyak tathaa upanishad rahe hai jinamein se adhikansh aajkal anuplabdh hai
 The Brahmin texts mainly discuss yajnas

 The practice of truth requires initiation as well as penance
 yajurveda main kaha he :- Vraten Dixamapnoti Dixayapnoti Dakshinam
 dakshina shraddhamapnoti shraddhya satyamapyate
 Fasting gives initiation, initiation gives Dakshina, Dakshina gives reverence and reverence leads to truth
 indriyon kaa sanyam
 To achieve any goal one has to do penance
 dharm ko paane ke liye bhi tap karnaa jaruri he
 Brahmacharya - The way you have to do penance in life, similarly in the future

 To propose the importance of this important decision and to propagate Hindi in every field, on the request of Rashtrabhasha Prachar Samiti, Wardha, on September 14, India is celebrated as hindi-day every year since 1953
 varsh 1918 main gandhi ji ne hindi sahitya sammelan main hindi bhashaa ko rashtrabhasha banane ko kaha tha
 Gandhiji also called it the language of the people
 swatantra bharat kii rajbhasha ke prashn par 14 sitambar 1949 ko kaaphi vichaar-vimarsh ke baad yah nirnay liya gaya jo bhartiya samvidhan ke bhaag 17 ke adhyay kii dhara 343 main is prakaar varnit he: This decision was taken on 14 September, due to which this day was considered as the best for Hindi Day
 haalanki jab rajbhasha ke rup main ise chunaa gaya or lagu kiya gaya to gaiyr-hindi bhashi rajya ke log iskaa virodh karne lage or angrezi ko bhi rajbhasha kaa darja dena padaa
 Due to this, English language started to influence in Hindi also
 hindi diwas ke dauraan kai kaarykram hote hai
 On this day, students are taught respect for Hindi and use of Hindi in daily practice etc
 jisamen hindi niabandh lekhan, vaad-vivaad hindi tankan pratiyogita aadi hota he
 Bhasha Samman has been introduced to inspire people towards Hindi on Hindi Day
 yah sammaan prativarsh desh ke aise vyaktitv ko diya jayega jisane jan-jan main hindi bhashaa ke prayog evam utthan ke liye vishesh yogadan diya he
 For this, one lakh one thousand rupees are given as honor
 hindi main niabandh lekhan pratiyogita ke dwaara kai jagah par hindi bhashaa ke vikaas or vistaar hetu kai suzav bhi praapt kiye jate hai
 But the next day all forget the Hindi language
 hindi bhashaa ko kuch or din yaad rakhen is kaaran rajbhasha saptaah kaa bhi aayojan hota he
 Due to which it remains for at least one week in a year
 bolne waalon kii sankhya ke anusaar angreji or chini bhashaa ke baad puure duniya main chauthi sabase badi bhashaa he
 But among those who understand it well, read and write this number is very less
 yah or bhi kam hoti ja rahi
 Along with this, English words have also had a great impact on the Hindi language and many words have been removed from circulation and the English word has taken its place
 jisase bhavishya main bhashaa ke vilupt hone kii bhi sambhaavna adhik bad gai he
 For this reason, people who have knowledge of Hindi or know Hindi language, this day is celebrated as Hindi Day to make them aware of their duty towards Hindi, so that all of them can perform their duty and make Hindi language future
 To save it from extinction
 lekin log or sarkaar donon hi iske liye udasin dikhti he
 Hindi lives as a maid in her home
 hindi ko aaj tak sanyukt raashtra sangh kii bhashaa nahin banaaya ja sakaa he
 It would be ironic to say that Yoga got the support of 177 countries, but what support cannot be gathered from 129 countries for Hindi? It has come such a situation that on the day of Hindi day, many people have to use words like speak in Hindi on Twitter
 amar ujaalaa ne bhi logon se vinati kiya ki kam se kam hindi diwas ke din hindi main twit karen
 Its main purpose is to make people aware of the fact that once a day in the year, Hindi language cannot develop until they use Hindi fully
 is ek din sabhi sarkari karyaalayon main angrezi ke sthaan par hindi kaa upyog karne kii salaah di jaati he
 Apart from this, one who does good development work in Hindi throughout the year and uses Hindi well in his work is awarded with the award
 kai log apane saamaanya bolchaal main bhi angrezi bhashaa ke shabdon kaa yaa angrezi kaa upyog karte hai, jisase dhire dhire hindi ke astitv ko khatra pahunch rahaa he
 Even today, the largest Hindi institution in the world, located in Varanasi, is in a very poor condition today
 is kaaran is din un sabhi se nivedan kiya jaataa he ki ve apane bolchaal kii bhashaa main bhi hindi kaa hi upyog karen
 Apart from this, people are also asked to write their thoughts etc
 in Hindi
 chunki hindi bhashaa main likhane hetu bahut kam upkaran ke bare main hi logon ko pataa he, is kaaran is din hindi bhashaa main likhane, jaanch karne or shabdkosh ke bare main jaankaree di jaati he
 There will be no significant benefit from working by some people for the development of Hindi language
 iske liye sabhi ko ek jute hokar hindi ke vikaas ko nae aayam tak pahunchaana hoga
 It is essential to protect the Hindi language from development and extinction
 rajbhasha saptaah yaa hindi saptaah 14 sitambar ko hindi diwas se ek saptaah ke liye manaaya jaataa he
 Different competitions are organized throughout this week
 yah aayojan vidhyalay or karyaalay donon main kiya jaataa he
 Its basic objective is to increase the feeling of development for Hindi language by not limiting it to the Hindi day only among people
 in saat dinon main logon ko niabandh lekhan, aadi ke dwaara hindi bhashaa ke vikaas or uske upyog ke laabh or na upyog karne par haani ke bare main samajhaayaa jaataa he
 An award ceremony is also organized on Hindi Divas to encourage people towards Hindi
 jisamen kaary ke dauraan acchhee hindi kaa upyog karne vaale ko yah puraskaar diya jaataa he
 It was earlier named after politicians, which was later changed to Rajbhasha Kirti Award and Rajbhasha Gaurav Award
 rajbhasha gaurav puraskaar logon ko diya jaataa he jabaki rajbhasha kirti puraskaar kisi vibhaag, samiti aadi ko diya jaataa he
 The award is given to any Indian citizen writing on the subject of technical or science
 isamen das hajaar se lekar do lakh rupee ke 13 puraskaar hote hai
 In this, the first prize winner gets Rs 2 lakh, the second prize winner gets one and a half lakh rupees and the third prize recipient gets seventy five thousand rupees
 saath hi das logon ko protsaahan puraskaar ke rup main das-das hajaar rupe pradaan kiye jate hai
 The awardees are also given a memento
 iskaa mul uddeshy takneekee or vigyaan ke kshetra main hindi bhashaa ko aage badhanaa he
 a total of 39 awards are given under this award scheme
 yah puraskaar kisi samiti, vibhaag, mandal aadi ko uske dwaara hindi main kiye gaye shreshth kaaryon ke liye diya jaataa he
 Its basic purpose is to use Hindi language in government functions
 kai hindi lekhakon or hindi bhashaa jaanane waalon kaa kahana he ki hindi diwas keval sarkari kaary kii tarah he, jise keval ek din ke liye manaa diya jaataa he
 This does not lead to any development of Hindi language, rather it hurts Hindi language
 kai log hindi diwas samaaroh main bhi angreji bhashaa main likh kar logon kaa swaagat karte hai
 The government runs it only to show that it is working for the development of Hindi language
 swayan sarkari karmchaaree bhi hindi ke sthaan par angrezi main kaary karte nazar aate hai
 But some people also think that those who oppose celebrating Hindi Day by giving various reasons and making fun of it want that the sense of right affinity towards Hindi should also be eliminated

 India jine ke ol world aircraft 1988-89 se data General characteristics pradarshan The Indian Ballistic Missile Defense Program is an initiative by India to deploy a multi-layered ballistic missile defense system to protect against ballistic missile attacks
 mukhya rup se pakistan kii belistic missile khatre ko dekhte hue ise shuru kiya gaya he
 Two missiles were built under this program
 uchaai kii missile ko maar giraane ke liye prithvi air dephence tathaa kam uchaai kii missile ko maar giraane ke liye advance air dephence ko viksit kiya gaya he
 Both these missiles can hit the missile coming from 5000 km away
 prithvi air dephence missile ko november 2006 tathaa advance air dephence ko disambar 2007 main test kiya gaya tha
 With the test of Prithvi Air Defense Missile, India became the fourth country in the world after the US, Russia and Israel to conduct anti ballistic missile tests
 is pranali ke test abhi bhi chal rahe or he aadhikarik taur par ise sena main shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 Since the early 90s, India has faced the threat of ballistic missile attacks from Pakistan, India has had to fight many wars with Pakistan and China in the past

 In May 1998, for the second time India tested nuclear weapons, after which Pakistan conducted its first nuclear test
 pakistan ne parmaanu hathiyaaron or missile delivery pranaaliyon ke pareekshan ke saath, bharat par missile khatra tej ho gaya
 India has also developed and tested the missile delivery system
 1999 main bharat or pakistan ke bich kargil yuddh do ghoshit parmaanu shaktiyon ke bich pehla sidhaa sangharsh ban gaya
 As the war progressed, the first indication of a possible use of nuclear weapons was found on 31 May, when Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad gave a warning that limited conflict would help Pakistan use "any weapon" in its arsenal
 Can be found
 isane turant vistaarit yuddh kii sthiti main pakistan dwaara parmaanu pratirodh kaa khatra spasht kaa diya tha
 The leader of Pakistan's Senate stated that "the purpose of developing weapons becomes meaningless if they are not used when necessary
" " kuch visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki 1998 main parmaanu pareekshanon ke baad, pakistani sena ko apane parmaanu nivarak aavaran se prerit kiya gaya tha taaki bharat ke khilaaf majbootee ko badhaayaa ja sake
 Development of the anti-ballistic missile system began in late 1999
 yah kehete dete hue ki bharat ne yuddh ke dauraan pehle upyog na karne kii niti kaa nirvaah kiya jabaki pakistan is yuddh main parmaanu bam kaa prayog karne ke liye utsuk rahaa or kargil yuddh ke dauraan badhate tanaav jisamen purna paimaane par parmaanu yuddh kii sambhaavna shaamil thi
 For this reason this program has been started
 is kaarykram ko do charnon main bata gaya
 To stop the missile coming from 2000 km in Phase-1, an anti ballistic missile was to be built, which was to be done up to 5000 km in Phase-2
 anti belistic missile pranali kaa vikaas 1999 main shuru hua
 About 40 public and private companies were involved in the development of the system
 inamen bharat electronics limited or bharat dynamiks limited, estra microwave, aesel, larsan and tubro, vem technologies privet limited or keltech shaamil hai
 Long Range Tracking Radar and Multi Function Fire Control Radar were developed by Electronics and Radar Development Establishment
 raksha anusandhan or vikaas prayogshaala ne advance air dephence missile ke liye mishan control software viksit kiya he
 Research Center, Imarat developed navigation, electromechanical actuation systems and active radar seekers

 The High Energy Materials Research Laboratory supplied propellants for the missile
 do nai anti belistic misile jo intermediat range belistic missile ko roak sake ko viksit kiya ja rahaa hai
 These high speed missiles are being developed to destroy ballistic missiles coming from about 5000 km
 2011 main in do pranaaliyon ke pareekshan pareekshan kii sambhaavna he nai missile america dwaara tainaat thed missile ke samaan hogi
 The speed of these missiles would be hypersonic and it would require radars with a scan capability of over 1500 km to successfully intercept targets
 6 may 2012 ko, dow ve ke saraswavat ne charan-1 ke puraa hone kii pushti karte hue kaha ki charan-2 2016 tak puraa ho jayega, jisamen 5000 kimi se aane vaali mixilon ko nasht kiya ja sakegaa
 India is also planning to develop a laser-based weapon system as part of its defense to intercept and destroy missiles so that missiles left towards the country can be destroyed immediately after launch
 drdo's Air Defense Program Director VK Saraswat has said that it would be ideal to destroy a ballistic missile carrying nuclear or conventional weapons
 saraswat ne aage kaha ki raksha anusandhan santhaan se ise raksha tak yogya banane ke liye 10-15 saal kaa samay lagegaa
 The two-stage ballistic missile defense system includes Prithvi Air Defense that will intercept missiles at exo-atmospheric altitudes of 50–80 km and is an advance air defense missile for endo-atmospheric interception at altitudes up to 30 km
 tainaat pranali main kai launch vaahan, radar, launch control centre or mishan control centre shaamil honge
 All of these are geographically distributed and connected by a secure communication network
 mishan control centre belistic missile raksha pranali kii software gahan vyavastha he
 It receives information from various sources such as radars and recitations, after which this information is processed by ten computers running simultaneously
 mishan control centre ek wide aria network ke madhyam se raksha ke sabhi anya tatwon se judaa hota he
 The Mission Control Center assesses target classification, target evaluation, and target destruction
 yah commander ke liye nirnay samarthan pranali ke rup main kaary karata he
 It can also decide the number of interceptors required for all probability of destroying the target
 After performing all these tasks, the mission control center informs the target of the launch battery to the launch control center
 launch control centre lakshya kii gati, oonchai or udaan path aadi radar se praapt jaankaree ke aadhaar par interceptor launch karne ke liye samay kii gananaa karnaa shuru karata he
 The launch control center prepares the missile for real-time launch and issues ground guidance computation
 interceptor launch karne ke baad, yah radar se praapt jaankaree ke madhyam se interceptor ko lakshya soochna pradaan kii jaati he jab interceptor lakshya missile ke kareeb hota he to interceptor lakshya missile ke liye apane radar khojak ko sakriy karata he or lakshya ko nasht karne ke liye swayan kaa maargdarshan karata he
 And destroys targets Many Earth Air Defense and Advance Air Defense interceptors can be launched against targets for high kill probabilities
 diardio ke vaigyanik vijay kumaar saraswat ke anusaar, missile kisi bhi target ko 99
8 pratishat hit karne kii sambhaavna ke liye banaai gayi he
 On 6 May 2012, Dr
 VK Saraswat confirmed that Phase-1 has been completed and can be deployed to protect two Indian cities on a short notice
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki charan-1 america raksha pranali piesi-3 patriot pranali ke saath tulaneey he
 New Delhi, the national capital and Mumbai have been selected for the ballistic missile defense shield
 dilli or mumbai main safal kriyanvayan ke baad, is pranali kaa upyog desh ke anya pramukh shaharon ko cover karne ke liye kiya jayega
 This shield can destroy ballistic missiles coming from 2500 km away
 dusre charan ke puraa hone par dono anti belistic missile exo or ando-vayumandaleey kshetra donon se 5000 kimi se aane vaali mixilon ko nasht kar sakati hai
