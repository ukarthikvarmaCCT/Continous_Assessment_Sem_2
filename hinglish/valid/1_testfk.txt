 Unlike human teeth, hard teeth do not push the milk teeth upwards
 varan naye daant mukh ke pichley bhaag main ugte hai tathaa puraane daanton ko aage kii taraf dhakelte hai jahaan puraane daant tut-tut kar gir jate hai
 The first group of teeth chewed from birth are present in African elephants

 kwantum computer par purnankon kaa gunankhand karne ke liye polinomial time main chalane vaala ek algoridm gyaat he 
 But despite a lot of effort, non-quantum algorithms running in polynomial time have not been found
 is baat ne saidhantik computer vigyaan kii ek mahatvapurn pariklpana strong carch turing thisis par shankaa daal di he
 The Strong Church Turing thesis is a philosophical argument that states - The computational problem for which a computer can become an algorithm running in polynomial time, for that problem will also be an algorithm running in polynomial time on a classical computer; And for a problem that cannot be an algorithm running in polynomial time on a classical computer, it cannot be an algorithm running in polynomial time on any computer
 chunki purnankon ke gunankhand ke liye kwantum computer par polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm he, strong carch turing thisis ke anusaar iske liye ek gaiyr-kwantum computer par bhi polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm jarur hoga
 Therefore, if one proves that a non-quantum computer for the factorization of integers cannot form an algorithm running in polynomial time, it would mean that the Strong Church Turing thesis is false

 Although they have contributed significantly to the current diagnostic criteria, questions have been raised on the specificity of first-line symptoms

 Schizophrenia is often described as a positive and negative symptom
 sakaaratmak lakshan shabd un lakshanon ko suchit karata hai jiskaa anubhav aam taur par adhikansh vyakti nahin karte hai lekin ve schizophrenia main upasthit rahete hai
 They include false delusions, auditory hallucinations and thinking disorders, and are specifically considered to be manifestations of psychosis

 Groups of other UK psychiatrists opposed the effort, saying that the term schizophrenia is useful, despite having a predominant ideology
 DSM main prayukt alag prakaar ke schizophrenia ke varg kii bhi aalochana kii gai he
 Similar to other mental disorders, some psychiatrists have suggested that its diagnosis should be taken on the basis of individual dimensions along with other variations, so that there remains a continuum rather than a gap between normal and sick people

 In concurring with this observation, psychologists Edgar Jones and psychiatrists Tony David and Nasser Ghaemi supervised the literature on the fallacy, pointing out that there has been a great deal of desire for people to find the symmetry and completeness of the definition of false illusion, false Illusions are neither necessarily static, nor is it wrong, nor are there current controllable events

 The word schizophrenia - which literally means brain splitting and comes from the Greek word schizein and phrēn, phren- - was introduced by Eugène Bleuler in 1908 and was linked to personality, thought, memory and perception

 In the early 1970s, the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were fraught with many controversies, the same being used for the criteria for current schizophrenia
 ye san 1971 ke US-UK diagnostic satadi ke baad or bhi saaf ho gaya ki sizophrenia ko america main europe ke mukaable adhik dekha jaataa he
 The reason behind this was the diagnosis criteria of US, DSM-II manual is used here whereas in Europe ICD-9 is used
 David Rosenhan's 1972 study, published in a journal titled Sions titled On being sane in insane places, concluded that the US way of diagnosing schizophrenia was put in the dock
 inamen kuch aise kaarak the jo sizophrenia ke nidaan se sambadhd the parantu sampurna DSM manual ke kaaran DSM-III ko 1980 main punah prakashit karnaa padow The misinterpretation of the word schizophrenia is generally taken to mean that the victim has a divided personality

 An Internet Protocol address is a numerical label assigned to devices participating in a computer network using the Internet Protocol for communication between its nodes
 ek IP adress do pramukh kaary karata he: mejabaan yaa network interfes pahchaan or sthaan parichayan
 isaki bhoomika kaa charitrachitran is prakaar he: "ek naam ingit karata he ki ham kya maangate hai
 An address indicates where he is
 ek maarg ingit karata he ki vahaan tak kaise pahunchen
" The designer of TCP / IP defined the IP address as a 32-bit number, and the system, known as Internet Protocol version 4 or ipv4, is still in use today
 baharhaal, internet ke vyapak vikaas or iske parinamswaroop uplabdh paton kii kami ke kaaran, 1995 main adress ke liye 128 bit upyog kar ke ek nayaa parichayan system, viksit kiya gaya or pichhali baar 1998 main RFC 2460 dwaara manakikrut kiya gaya
 Although IP addresses are stored as binary numbers, they are usually displayed in human-textual markers such as 208

 As the development of private networks raised the threat of ipv4 address termination, RFC 1918 set out a set of private address spaces that could be used by anyone on a private network
 vah vaishvik saarvajanik internet se judane ke liye, aksar network adress anuvadak ke saath upyog kiye jate hai
 The Internet Assigned Number Authority, which manages universal IP address space allocation, supports five regional Internet registries to allocate IP blocks to local Internet registries and other entities
 internet protocol ke do sanskaran upyog main hai: ai pi sanskaran 4 or ypi sanskaran 6

) prayek sanskaran ek ypi adress ko alag dhang se paribhaashit karata he
 Because of its prevalence, the generic term IP address generally still refers to the address defined by ipv4
 ipv4, 32-bit adress kaa upyog karata he, jo adress sthaan ko 4,294,967,296 ) sambhav adwitiya adress par simit karata hai
 ipv4 reserves some addresses for special purposes such as private networks or multicast addresses
 isse ant upyogkartaaon ko niyat kiye jane vaale paton kii sankhya kam ho jaati he or jaise hi uplabdh paton kii sankhya kshay ho jaati he, ipv4 pataa samaapan nishchit ho jaataa he
 This foreseeable shortfall was the primary motivation for developing ipv6, which is in various deployment stages around the world, as the only strategy for ipv4 replacement and continued expansion of the Internet
 ipv4 adress aamtaur par dot-dashamalav sanketan main darshaae jate hai 
 Each part represents 8 bits of address and is therefore called octet
 takneekee lekhan ke kam aam maamalon main, ipv4 adress, shodash aadhari, ashtadhari, yaa binary abhivedan main prastut kiya ja saktaa he
 Each octet is changed individually in the most representation
 internet protocol ke vikaas ke praarambhik charan main, network ke prashaskon ne IP adress kaa do bhaagon main varnan kiya, network sankhya bhaag or mejabaan sankhya main bhaag
 ek adress main sarvocch kram ocotate ko network number abhinihit kiya jaataa tha or baaki ke bits rest field yaa host identiphire kehalaae jate the or network ke abhyantar mezbaan sankhyankan ke liye istemaal kiye jate the
 This method soon proved to be analogous as soon as additional networks were developed that were independent of the existing networks, which would have already been characterized by a network number
 1981 main, classphul network sanrachana ke samaveshan ke saath internet parichayan vinirdesh main sanshodhan kiya gaya
 Classful network design allowed a large number of individual network tasks
 ek IP adress ke sabase mahatvapurn ocotate ke pehle teen bit, adress kii shrenee ke rup main paribhaashit kiye gaye
 Three categories were defined for universal unicast detection
 vyutpann varg ke aadhaar par network pahchaan puure pate ke octate seemaa kshetron par aadhaarit tha
 Each category used sequentially extra octets in the network identifier, thus reducing the number of possible hosts in the higher class category
 nimna talika is faltah aprachlit pranali kaa ek simhavlokan detaa he
 The description of this design is explained in the article 'subnetwork' and 'classful Network'
 haalanki classphul network abhikalp ek safal vikasaatmak avasthaa thi lekin internet ke betahasha vistaar ke kaaran ise aage badhanaa mushkil ho gaya or jab nae ypi adress khand dene ke liye classles inter-domen rooting kaa srijan kiya gaya or rooting protocol ke liye ipivi4 adress kaa prayog karne ke liye nae niyam taiyaar kiye gaye to ise chhod diya gaya
 CIDR is based on variable-length subnet masking for the allocation and routing of arbitrary-length prefixes
 aaj, classphul network sankalpana ke avshisht keval ek simit kshetra main kaam karte hai jo ki kuch network software or hardware ghatakon ke diphalt kanfigration maapdand hai or network prashaskon kii charchaa ke takneekee jorganon main prayukt hote hai
 In the initial network design, when the idea of connecting all Internet users globally from one bite to another for communication was intended, each computer or device had a unique IP address
 lekin yah paaya gaya ki hameshaa aisa kar paanaa sambhav nahin he kyonki nijee network viksit ho gaye or saarvajanik paton kaa sthaan sangrakshit karne kii jarurat padi 
 Computers that are not connected to the Internet, such as factory machines that communicate only through TCP / IP, are not required to have a globally unique IP address
 nijee network ke liye ipv4 paton main se teen simaaen, har varg ke liye ek seemaa, 1918 RFC main arakshit thi
 These addresses are not routed over the Internet and hence there is no need to coordinate them with the register of IP addresses
 aaj, jab jarurat padati he, aise nijee network aamtaur par network pataa anuwaad ke madhyam se internet se conect ho jate hai
 Any user can use any reserved block

 The IP version 4 address space is rapidly approaching the closing of its officially available allocated address segments
 sangrakshan takneekon ke baavjood, ipv4 adress sthaan ke teji se samaapan ne internet ejineering task force ko internet kii parichayan kshamta kaa vistaar karne ke liye nai praudyogikiyon kaa pataa lagane ke liye prerit kiya
 Its permanent solution, a redesign of the Internet protocol itself, was understood
 internet protocol kii yah agali peedi, jiskaa uddeshy internet par ipv4 kii jagah lenaa tha, antat 1995 main ise internet protocol sanskaran 6 kaa naam diya gaya
 The address size was increased from 32 to 128 bit or 16 octets, which, even with a generous working of network blocks, is considered sufficient for the foreseeable future
 ganitiya, nayaa adress sthaan, adhiktam 2, yaa lagbhag 3
403×10 adwitiya pate kii kshamta pradaan karata he
 The new design is not only based on the goal of providing a sufficient amount of addresses, but to allow efficient aggregation of subnet routing prefixes to occur on the routing nodes
 parinamswaroop, anumaargan talika aakaar chota hota hai or sabase chota sambhav vyaktigat aavanton 264 host ke liye ek sabanet he, jo puure ipv4 internet ke aakaar kaa vargakar he
 At these levels, the actual address usage rate will be smaller on any ipv6 network segment

 ipv6 has features that, if there is a change in global connectivity or routing policy, automatically change the routing prefix of the entire network without internal redesigns or new numbering
 ipv6 paton kii badi sankhya vishisht prayojanon ke liye bade block nirdisht karne kii anumati dete he or jahaan uchit he, kushal maarg ke liye ekatrit hone kii
 a complex address protection technique with a large address space is not required, such as Classless used in inter-domain routing
 sabalmodern ke anusaar desktop or udhyam sarwar oparating system ipv6 protocol ke liye nishkapat samarthan shaamil karte hai, lekin yah abhi tak anya upkarnon jaise home netwarking raootraz, vois over internet protocol or multimedia upkaran or network paridhiy main vyapak rup se tainaat nahin hai
 Example of an ipv6 address: jaise ipv4 nijee yaa aantarik network ke liye adress arakshit karata he, ipv6 main nijee adress ke liye adress ke vibhaag alag se samucchy kiye hote hai
 In ipv6, these are referred to as unique local addresses
 RFC 4,193 is vibhaag ke liye anumaargan upsarg fc00:: / 7 alag se samucchy karata he, jo ki vibhinn uplakshith nitiyon ke saath do / 8 vibhaagon main vibhajit he adress main ek 40 bit chhadam yadrichhik sankhya shaamil hoti he jo sait vilay yaa packet ke galat maarg par chal jane se hone vaale adress muthbhed ke jokhim ko kam karti he
 Initial designs used a separate section for this purpose, dubbed site-local address
 However, the definition of what constitutes a site remained unclear and a poorly defined detection policy created doubt in routing
 adress range vinirdesh chhod diya gaya or ab nai vyavastha main istemaal nahin karnaa chahie
 Addresses starting with fe80: - called link-local addresses - are assigned only in the local link area
 prayek network interfes ke liye oparating system ke IP parat dwaara aamtaur par swachaalit rup se adress utpann kiye jate hai
 This provides instant automatic network connectivity for any ipv6 host and means that if multiple hosts connect to a common hub or switch, they get an instant communication route via their link local ipv6 address
 ipv6 network prashasan kii nichali paraton main is suvidha kaa bade paimaane par or adhikansh upyogkartaaon ke liye apratyaksh rup se, istemaal kiya jaataa he 
 No private address prefix can be sent to the public internet
 sabnating kii takanic donon ipv4 or ipv6 network main kaam kar sakati hai
 The IP address is divided into two parts: the network address and the host identifier
 The subnet mask or CIDR prefix determines how the IP address is divided into network and host parts
 shabd sabanet mask keval ipv4 main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Both IP versions, however, use the concept and notation of classless inter-domain routing
 is main, IP adress ke peeche ek slesh or network bhaag ke liye istemaal kii gai bits kii sankhya, jise maarg upsarg bhi kaha jaataa he, hote he
 For example, an ipv4 address and its subnet mask can be 192

 When a computer is configured to use the same IP address each time it becomes faster, it is called static IP address
 iske vipareet, un sthitiyon main jab computer ke ypi pate swatah hi niyukt kiye jate hai, use dinemic ypi adress ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Static IP address is assigned to the computer manually by an administrator
 isaki sateek prakriya platform ke anusaar pruthak hoti he
 These are not compatible with dynamic IP addresses, which are specified by either computer interfaces or self-hosted software, such as in Xerconf, or specified by a server using dynamic host configuration protocols
 haalanki DHCP ke upyog se nirdisht ypi adress lambey samay ke liye ek jaise rahete hai, vah aam taur par badal sakate hai
 In some cases, a network administrator may actively implement a specified static IP address
 is maamle main, ek DHCP sarwar kaa upyog hota he, lekin ek vishisht computer ko hameshaa ek hi ypi adress nirdisht karne ke liye, iskaa samanurup vishesh rup se kiya jaataa he
 This allows the static IP address to be primarily configured, not requiring each computer on the network to be specifically configured by a manual system
 static yaa statephul adress vinyas ke abhaav yaa vifaltaa main, ek parichaalan pranali ek network interphes ko state-les swachaalit-samakriti takanic, jaise xerokonf, ke upyog se ypi adress nirdisht kar sakati he
 Dynamic IP addresses are most frequently employed by dynamic host configuration protocol servers on lans and broadband networks
 inhen isliye istemaal kiya jaataa he kyunki yah ek network par prayek upkaran ke liye vishisht static adress nirdisht karne ke prashasnic boj se bachaa sakate he
 It also allows multiple devices to interact in a limited address space on a network, but only if some of them are online at a particular time
 In many current desktop operating systems, dynamic IP configuration is enabled by default so that a user does not need to manually enter any settings to connect to a network with a DHCP server
 DHCP is not the only technique for specifying dynamic IP addresses
 dyaap or kuch broadband network bindu se bindu protocol kii gatisheel adress visheshtaayen upyog karte hai
 a sticky dynamic IP address or sticky IP cable and DSL is used by the Internet payer to describe a dynamically assigned IP address that often does not change
 pate aamtaur par DHCP protocol ke saath niyukt kiye jate he
 Since modems typically operate for extended periods of time, address leases are often regularized for longer periods and renewed upon expiration
 yadi ek modem band kar diya jaae or adress patte ke agle samaapan se pehle phir se sanchalit kiya jaae, to is baat kii sarvaadhik sambhaavna he ki use vahi IP adress praapt hoga
 The RFC 3330 defines an address block, 169

 ipv6 main, sthitik yaa gatik adress kaaryon kaa upyog karne vaala, prayek interphes fe80:: / 10 sabanet main swatah ek sthaneey-link adress praapt karata he
 These addresses are valid only on the link, such as a local network segment or a point-wise connection to which a host is connected
 ye adress margskshmiya nahin hote or nijee adreson kii tarah internet packet pratibandhan ke strot yaa gantavy nahin ho sakate hai
 When the local-link ipv4 address block was reserved, no standard existed for the address auto-configuration mechanism

 According to today, firewalls are common on the Internet
 badi hui network suraksha ke liye, vah graahak ke saarvajanik ypi par aadhaarit nijee network ko abhigam niyantran karte hai
 Using a blacklist or white list, the IP address that is blocked is the client's stated public IP address, meaning if the client is using a proxy server or NAT, blocking an IP address can cause many different people Can be blocked
 IP adress prayog karne ke liye ekaadhik graahak upkaran pradarshit ho sakate hai: yaa to isliye kyonki vah ek saajhe hosting web sarwar vaataavaran kaa hissaa hai yaa kyonki ek ipv4 network adress anuvadak yaa proxi sarwar apane graahakon kii ore se ek madhyasth ke rup main kaam karata he, is avasthaa main, asli utpann IP adress ek anurodh praapt kar rahe sarwar se chhipe ho sakate he
 a common practice is for NAT to hide a large number of IP addresses in a private network
 NAT ke keval "bahari" interphes ko internet ruteble adress kii aavashkata he
 The most common net devices map TCP or UDP port numbers on the outside and individual private addresses on the inside
 jaise ek telephone number kaa site-vishesh vistaaran ho saktaa hai, port sankhya IP adress ke liye ek site-vishesh vistaaran hai
 In small home networks, NAT functions typically take place in a residential gateway device, typically sold as a "router"
 is paridrishy main, router se jude computer ke paas 'nijee' IP adress hoga or router ke paas internet ke saath samvaad karne ke liye ek shaskeey adress hoga
 This type of router allows multiple computers to share a public IP address

 iske pashchaat 1990 main inhone bhartiya praudyogiki santhaan ke civil abhiyantriki vibhaag main pravesh liya or 1994 main snaatak kii pariksha uteern kii
 After this, he joined the Masters in Kashi Hindu University and passed this examination with honors
 bachapan se hi satyendra kii gananaa pratibhashali vidhyaarthiyon main hoti thi
 Satyendra passed the Indian Engineering Service Examination as a result of which he got the post of Project Director in National Highways Authority of India in 2002
 is pad par kaam karte samay unhen svarnim chaturbhuj pariyojna main kaary karne kaa mauka mila
 While working in this project, he came to know about corruption and financial irregularities happening on a large scale
 vibhaag ke thekedaaron or engeeron kii saath-geth se bhrashtachar kaa dhandha khub fal phool rahaa tha
 Satyendra took action against some corrupt officials and engineers of his own department and suspended them
 satyendra ne iske baad bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ek muhim shuru kar di or apane vibhaag main ho rahi duusari aniyamittaaon par bhi dhyaan kendrit kiya
 He also wrote a letter to the director and other officials of his department about these irregularities, but no one paid any heed to them
 in shikayaton ke parinaam swaroop unka sthanantaran gaya jile main kar diya gaya
 In Gaya district too, he did not allow any reduction in the campaign against his corruption
 satyendra ko in sabhi ke falswaroop dhamkiyaan bhi mili
 Seeing the corruption prevailing at a high level, Satyendra decided to complain to the Prime Minister and wrote a detailed letter
 us gopneey patr main satyendra ne bhrashtachar par vidhivat prakaash daalaa or use pradhanmantri karyaalay ko bhej diya
 Seeing the seriousness of corruption, Satyendra had requested to keep his name confidential in that letter
 baad main yah dekha gaya ki satyendra ke anurodh ke baad bhi karyaalay adhikariyon ne us patr ko satyendra ke naam ke saath alag alag vibhaagon main agrasaarit kar diya
 Satyendra was killed when he was returning home from Banaras after a wedding ceremony
 ve banaras se gaya tak train dwaara pahunche or uske baad gaya stesan se rickshaw dwaara ghar jate samay raste main goli maar unki hatya kii gai
 JP in Gaya His dead body was found on the way to the colony
 satyendra kii mrityu ne lok sabha tak ko andolit kiya
 In view of the protests and general public discontent in the country, the investigation of his death was handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation by the government
 satyendra kii hatya se raajnneetik or saamaajik str par ek bhuuchaal aa gaya
 Other organizations working against corruption raised the matter
 jiske parinamswaroop sarkaar ko nitigat str par bhrashtachar ko ujagar karne vaale logon kii pahchaan surakshit rakhane kaa niyam bananaa padaa
 One of the biggest results of Satyendra's sacrifice was that corrupt officials of government departments started to fear the honest people
 baad ke varshon main aayaa soochna kaa adhikaar adhinium is disha main mile kaa ek pathar sabit hua
 This rule proved to be a weapon for persons exposed to corruption
 francisi kranti france ke itihaas kii rajnatik or saamaajik uthal-puthal evam amul parivartan kii avadhi thi jo 1789 se 1799 tak chali
 Later, Napoleon Bonaparte carried this revolution to some degree by the expansion of the French Empire
 kranti ke falswaroop raja ko gaddi se hataa diya gaya, ek ganatantr kii sthapana hui, khooni sangharshon kaa daur chalaa, or antatah nepolian kii taanaashaahee sthapit hui jisase is kranti ke anekon mulyon kaa pashchimi europe main tathaa uske baahar prasar hua
 This revolution changed the direction of modern history
 isse vishwa bhar main nirpeksh rajtantr kaa hraas hona shuru hua, naye ganatantr ev udaar prajatantra bane
 In the modern era, the state revolution of France proved to be the most dramatic and complex in which the Western civilization shook Western civilization
 is kranti ne keval france ko hi nahin apitu samast europe ke jan-jivan ko ast-vyast kar diya
 The French Revolution has been called a milestone in the history of the entire world
 is kranti ne anya europea deshon main bhi swatantrata kii lalak kaayam kii or anya desh bhi rajshahi se mukti ke liye sangharsh karne lage
 This created an atmosphere against monarchy and autocracy in Asian countries, including European nations
 france main nirankush rajtantr tha jo rajtv ke daivi siddhanth par aadhaarit tha
 In this the king had unlimited rights and the king was arbitrary
 lui 14wein ke shasankaal main nirankushta apni paraakaashtha par thi
 He said- "I am the state"
 vah apni icchaanusaar kanoon banaata tha
 He made excessive centralization of power in favor of monarchy
 kootneeti or sainya kaushal se france kaa vistaar kiya
 In this way he made the monarchy a serious profession
 lui 14wein ne jis shashan vyavastha kaa kendrikaran kiya tha usne yogya raja kaa hona aavashyak tha kintu uske uttaradhikari lui 15waan evam looyee 16vaan purnatah ayogy the
 Louis was the 15th most luxurious, short-sighted and passive ruler
 austria ke uttaradhikaar yuddh evam saptavarshiya yuddh main bhaag lekar desh kii aarthik sthiti ko baari kshati pahunchaai
 Despite this, the Palace of Versailles remained a center of luxury
 usne kaha ki mere baad pralay hogi
 Louis was the ruler of the 16th on the eve of the revolution
 vah ek akarmanya or ayogy shaasha tha
 He too exhibited demeanor and autocracy
 usne kaha ki "yah cheez isliye kanoonee he ki yah main chahta hum
 "at the time of resignation of one of his ministers, he said - i wish i could resign
 uski patni meri antoniat kaa us par atyadhik prabhaav tha
 She used to spend extravagantly
 use aam aadmi kii pareshaaniyon kii koi samaj nahin thi
 Once when a procession of people was asking for bread, he advised that if bread is not available then why do people not eat cake
 is tarah desh kii shashan paddati puri tarah naukarshahi par nirbhar thi
 Which was hereditary
 unki bhartee tathaa prashikshan ke koi niyam nahin the or in naukarshahon par bhi niyantran lagane vaali sanstha maujuud nahin thi
 Thus the system of governance was completely corrupt, autocratic, passive and exploitative
 vyaktigat kanoon or raja kii ichha kaa hi kanoon lagu hota tha
 As a result, there was a lack of uniform law code in the country and prevalence of different laws in different areas
 is avyavasthit or jatil kanoon ke kaaran janata ko apane hi kanoon kaa gyaan nahin tha
 The existence of this disorganized autocratic and sensitive governance system became painful for the people
 in utpeedak raajnneetik paristhitiyon ne kranti kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Regarding France's chaotic situation, u can be said that "there was no question of bad system, there was no system at all
" " The causes of the revolution can also be seen under social conditions
 francisi samaaj visham or vighatit tha
 That society was divided into three classes / states
 pratham stats main padri varg, dwitiya stats main kuleen varg evam tritiy stats main jansadharan shaamil tha
 The clergy and the nobility enjoyed wide privileges while the public was devoid of authority
 kisaanon kii sankhya sarvaadhik thi or inaki dasha nimna or sochneey thi
 The peasants had to pay many taxes to the state, the church and other zamindars and the feudal tyrants had to bear
 ek drushti se kisaanon ke asantosh kaa mukhya kaaran saamanton dwaara die ja rahe ksht evam asuvidhaayen thi or rajtantr is par chuppi saadhe hue tha
 In this way, the peasants had become so grieved that they themselves turned into a revolutionary element and they needed only a sign to make revolution
 madhyam varg main sahukaar vyapaaree, shikshak, vakil, doctor, lekhak, kalakaar, karmchaaree aadi sammilit the
 His economic condition was certainly right, yet he was angry with the political, social and economic conditions of the time
 is varg ko koi raajnneetik adhikaar praapt nahin tha or padri or kuleen varg kaa vyavhaar inke prati acha nahin tha
 For this reason the middle class hated the social superiority of the nobles and was willing to change the political system and get their rights
 yahi kaaran tha ki france kii kranti main unka mukhya yogadan rahaa or unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 There were also some economic complaints from the middle class
 purv ke vaanijya vyapaar ke kaaran is varg ne dhansampatti arjeet kar lee thi kintu ab saamanti vaataavaran main unke vyapaar par kai tarah ke pratibandh lage the jagah-jagah chungi deni padati thi
 They wanted a free environment for their trade business
 iske liye unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 In this way we can say that the French Revolution was the result of the struggle of two conflicting factions of French society
 ek taraf raajnneetik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee or duusari taraf aarthik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee varg the
 To dominate the politics and government of the country, struggle between these two classes was inevitable
 is tarah 1789 kii francisi kranti, francisi samaaj main asamanta ke viruddh sangharsh thi
 The economic condition of France was in trouble
 rajya diwaliyapan ke kagaar par pahunch gaya tha
 In fact the royal treasury was emptied due to the extravagance of the kings of France and the frequent wars of Louis the 14th
 uski mrityu ke baad lui 15wein ne austria ke uttaradhikaar yuddh evam saptavarshiya yuddh main bhaag liya jisase rajkosh par boj or badha or antat lui 16wein ne america swatantraaa yuddh main bhaag lekar france kii aarthik dasha ko or bhi jarjar bana diya
 An excessive amount of the state was spent on the emperor, empress and his family
 varsay kaa rajmahal rajkosh ke lutpaat kaa saadhan bana tha
 On the other hand the tax system was unsatisfactory
 visheshadhikaron ke kaaran sampann varg kar se mukt tha tathaa garib kisaan jo aarthik drushti se vipann tha, ekmaatr karadaata tha
 In this way the state of the treasury had become extremely thoughtful
 sarkaar france main aay ke anusaar vyay karne ke bajaay vyay ke anusaar aay ko nishchit karti thi
 The state was burdened with debt
 mul dhan kii to baat hi kya france byaaj chukaane main asamarth tha arthath rajya divaaliepan kii sthiti main pahunch gaya tha
 The country's economic malpractices could be improved by encouraging trade commerce, but the government's commercial policy was so uncontrolled and flawed that it did not make possible the development of production and trade in the state
 lui 16wein ne turgon, nekar jaise vitt salaahkaaron ke madhyam se aarthik sankat ko dur kanane kaa prayaas kiya lekin ye sudhaar prayaas lagu nahin ho sake kyonki visheshadhikaar praapt varg ne apane upar kar lagane kii baat sweekaar nahin kii
 The demand for a meeting of the estate general was eventually called for passing resolutions for the abolition of privilege, and the revolution coincided with the meeting of the estate general in 1789, so the economic plight of the time was considered the most important cause of the French Revolution is
 francisi kranti main darshanikon kii bhoomika ke sandarbh main do mat saamne aate hai-ek, darshanikon ne kranti kii paristhitiyon ko janm dekar kranti ko utpann kiya or doosraa kranti kaa strot to us samay ke rashtriya jivan ke dosha main tathaa sarkaar kii bhuulon main tha or darshanikon ne kranti utpann nahin kii
 It would be desirable to understand the views of those philosophers and their relationship with the revolution before passing judgment on any opinion
 darshanikon ke vichaaron kii lokapriyata kaa nirdhaaran to us samay unke chape lekhon ke sanskarnon or prasar ke aadhaar par dekha janaa chahie
 Montescue in his book 'the Spirit of Laws' contradicted the principles of the king's divine rights and offered not only a critique of French political institutions but also an alternative
 usne likhaa ki francisi sarkaar nirkunsh sarkaar he kyonki france main karypalika, nyaaypalika or vidhayika sambandhi sabhi shaktiyaan ek hi vyakti arthath raja ke haathon main kendrit he isliye france kii janata ko swatantraaa praapt nahin he
 It was in this context that he gave the principle of "separation of power", according to which the three principal organs of governance, the executive, the judiciary and the administrator, were advised to be placed in separate hands
 usne england ke saraakar ko adarsh bataaya kyonki vahaan sanvaidhanik rajtantr tha jisase vahaan nagarikon ko swatantraaa thi
 Thus his ideas that Montescue hurt France's autocratic state system through segregation of power became so popular that six editions were published in three years of 'the Spirit of Lodges'
 yahaan dhyaan rakhane kii baat yah he ki montescue ne na to kranti kii baat kii or na hi rajtantr ko samaapt karne kii usne to sirp nirankush rajtantr ke dosha ko ujagar kiya or sanvaidhanik rajtantr kii baat kii
 Voltaire illustrated the liberal politics, religion and freedom of thought of Britain through his book Letters on English and compared it to the ancient French system and noted the evils and shortcomings prevalent in France
 pratibandhit hone se purv ye pustaken bahut lokapriy hui thi
 "voltaire" wrote against the Church's corrupt pickles, intolerance, injustice, oppression and tyranny
 carch kii bhrashtataa par ungali uthaate hue usne likhaa ki ab to koi isai bachaa nahin kyonki ek hi isai tha or use suuli par chadha diya gaya
 He wrote that crush the notorious and infamous thing
 yah spasht rup se france ke nirankush rajtantr evam carch ke atyaachaar par prahaar tha
 Waltair wanted to establish a similar rule in France, in line with the constitutional monarchy of England
 usne kaha ki main sau chuhon ke sthaan par ek singh kaa shashan pasand karata hoon
 Voltaire did not speak of revolution but laid the background for freedom of thought
 usne puraatan francisi vyavastha kii buraaiyon ko ujagar kiya
 He presented to the people the mirror of the erstwhile French society and said that the mirror is called a stain
 ruso ne apni pustak “emily”, “soshal contract”, “rusoni” ke madhyam se manushya kii swatantraaa kii baat kii
 It said that despite being born free of human beings, everyone is chained with chains
 in zanjeeron se mukti paane kaa ek hi tarika he ki ham prakritik aadim avasthaa kii ore laute
 The Russians said that it is the compulsory and universal duty of a state made by collective will to conduct the work considering the whole society as paramount
 jin logon ko karypalika shakti saupin gai he ve janata ke swami nahin uske kaaryakari he, or unka kartavya janata kii ajna kaa paalan karnaa he
 In this way he firmly believed that the paramount power should be in the hands of the public and not in the hands of any individual or institution
 saarvbhaum satta janata kii ichha main nihit he jise “saamaanya ichha” kaha gaya
 The law of the state should be an expression of this common desire, but the nature of the law is no longer such, but it is dependent on the will of the ruler
 ruson ne bhi kranti kii baat nahin kii lekin sabhi vyakti ko swatantra evam samaan mana or francisi kranti ke naare swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav usee ke vichaaron se prabhavit the
 Napoleon acknowledged his importance and said that if there had not been the Russians, there would not have been a revolution in France
 ruson kii 'soshal contract' kii lokapriyata kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki ek varsh main uske 13 sanskaran prakashit hue
 The French scholar Didro is credited with compiling the works of the best thinkers of the 18th century and bringing them to the general public
 isamen shashan kii buraaiyon, carch kii bhrashtataa tathaa har kshetra main vyaapt asamanta ko ujagar kiya gaya
 The French government considered the Daiders to be its greatest enemy and imposed several restrictions on his book

 These economists were known as "physiocrats"

 Quessne was a supporter of free trade

 He argued that only land is the primary source of all wealth
 atah kar keval bhoomi par lagaana chahie vyapaaree evam kaarigaron par nahin
 By the time of the 16th, the French financial system had sunk into debt
 america swatantraaa sangram ne france ke divaaliepan par muhar laga di
 Therefore, in order to overcome the economic distress, the help of economists like Turks, Necker, Cologne took
 colon ne visheshadhikaar praapt kuleen varg par kar lagane kaa suzav diya jise kulinon ne asweekaar kar diya
 The meeting of the States General was finally called
 yah baithak 1789 se 175 varsh baad ho rahi thi
 All classes were excited to hear the news of the meeting of the States General
 kulina ummid thi ki is baithak main ve un visheshadhikaron ko praapt kar sakenge jo lui 14waan ke samay usne chhin liye gaye the
 The people of the middle class believed that they would be able to formulate progressive policies in their favor
 kisaanon ko aashaa thi ki vah saamanti visheshadhikaron ke viruddh aawaaj uthaakar apane adhikaron ko surakshit kar unke shoshan chakra se mukt ho sakenge
 In this way no significant portion of the French population was ready to support the French monarchy
 estats general ke adhiveshan main matadhikaar paddati ke mudde par tritiy state evam anya state ke bich vivaad ho gaya
 Voting was said that each state would be considered to have only one vote
 is prakaar visheshadhikaar praapt varg kaa do tathaa jansadharan kaa ek hi mat hota he
 Representatives of the general public, ie 'third State' opposed this voting system because it would have reduced them to a minority even though they were many
 tritiy state yah chahta tha ki teenon shreniyon ke pratinidhi ek saath baithkar bahumat se nirnay le lekin padri evam kuleen varg alag-alag baithak chaahate the
 Therefore, the Third State boycotted the meeting of the States General and declared itself as a national assembly, representing the entire nation and convened its meeting in the nearby tennis court
 francisi kranti vibhinn charnon se hote hue apane mukaam tak pahunchi
 From the point of view of convenience of the study, the revolution can be seen by dividing it into the following four stages
 is charan main paris kii bheed ne bastil ke kile par niyantran sthapit kiya
 This is how the revolution started
 vastutah bastil kaa kila nirankushta evam atyaachaar kaa pratik tha or iske patan se puraatan vyavastha kaa gahari chunauti mili
 The incident also affected the rural areas of France and the villagers set fire to the records of feudal taxes
 janata kii in kaarywahiyon kaa rashtriya sabha par bhi gaharaa asar padaa
 So, on 4 August 1789, an overnight session of the National Assembly took place in which all the privileges were abolished by framing laws
 is tarah england or america ko samaapt kar diya gaya
 The important function of the National Assembly was to create a constitution
 atah rashtriya sabha hi samvidhan sabha kahalaayi or 26 agast 1789 ko samvidhan sabha ne maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 The Constituent Assembly declared human rights as its ideals and objectives
 is ghoshnaa main samanta ke siddhanth par bal diya gaya or kaha gaya ki chunki sabhi manushya samaan rup se paidaa hote he atah unhen samaan adhikaar milane chahie
 These rights included freedom, property security and the right to protest against tyranny etc
 is prakaar samvidhan sabha ne aadharbhoot siddhanton, swatantraaa, samanta va janata ke prabhutv kii ghoshnaa kii
 The right to property was repeated in the manifesto
 is adhikaar se kisi ko vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 The National Constituent Assembly seized church property and attempted to reduce the church's control over the public
 is sandarbh main carch ko rajya ke adheen le aayaa gaya or use rome ke pope ke prabhaav se mukt kar rashtriya carch ke rup main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 a "civil Constitution of Clergy" was created to secure the clergy's loyalty to the state
 jiske anusaar padariyon ko rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath leni padati thi or janata ke dwaara unka chunaav hota tha
 The pope and some priests opposed the move
 jin padariyon ne rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath grahan ki ve “jurar” kehalaae jabaki shapath nahin lene vaale “non jurar” kehalaae
 This law created an atmosphere against the revolution because so far the small clergy had supported the revolution
 ab ve isse alag ho gaye or kuch padri desh chhod videshon main chale gaye or vahaan europe main kranti ke viruddh prachaar karne lage
 The National Constituent Assembly prepared a written constitution for France, and this constitution was approved by Louis XVI in 1791
 samvidhan main do baton par bal diya gaya-ek, rajya kii saarvbhaum shakti janata main nihit he or doosraa, shakti kaa pruthakkaran rajya evam janata ke hit main he
 Although the system of governance remained monarchical, the king's powers were limited
 ab vah kanoon nirmaataa nahin rahaa
 The king did not have the right to make war or treaty with any country
 kanoon banane kaa adhikaar ek vyavasthapika sabha ko diya gaya or uske sadasyon kii sankhya 745 thi
 The citizens were divided into two parts, active and inactive, for the election of members of the administration and the franchise was given only to the active citizens
 sakriy naagarik 25 varsh se adhik aayu ke ve log the jo rajya ko teen din kii aay ke baraabar pratyaksh kar dete the jabaki niskriy naagarik ve the jo garib the
 The National Assembly changed the administrative structure of France
 pracheen praanto ko khatm karke sampoorn desh ko 83 departmenton main vibhakti kiya gaya
 These departments were divided into Cantan and Comune
 prayek ikaiyon kaa shashan chalaane ke liye nirvachan parishad hoti thi jiskaa chunaav sakriy naagarik karte the
 In this way, the entire state system from the local level to the central level came to the Barja class
 rashtriya sabha ke bhang hone ke pashchaat 1791 i

 Those sitting on the right hand side of the Speaker in this administrative assembly are called 'right-wingers'
 ye log anudaar evam rajtantr ke samarthak the jabaki bain ore baithne vaale 'vampanthi' kehalaae or yah samooh mul parivartanwaadiyon kaa tha jo ugr or krantikari the
 Radicals were also divided into two classes - Jirondist and Jacobian
 isi bich france kii kranti kaa bhay europe ke anya deshon ke bhi failane laga
 The clergy and oligarchs who had fled from France to other regions of Europe spread the spirit against the revolution
 duusari taraf france ke krantikari anya deshon main bhi krantikari siddhanton ko prachaar chaah rahe the
 As a result, other kings of Europe became suspicious
 parinamswaroop krantikari france or europe ke anya deshon kaa aapasi sambandh bigadaa
 Austria, despite the refusal of the revolutionaries, had allowed the refugees of the French monarchy to remain with them
 atah vyavasthapika sabha ne apairal 1792 i
 main austria ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar di, kintu france kii sena buree tarah parajeet hui
 The defeat convinced the French people that the king had told Austria all the secrets of France's military power and security
 atah raja ke prati janata kaa ravaiya ugr ho gaya
 In these conditions, in support of the French monarchy, Prasha and Austria declared that the French people should obey the king, otherwise we will take action against them
 is tarah france kii kranti ne europe main yuddh kii sthiti utpann kii
 The announcement made the people of France more enraged and surrounded the king
 raja bhagkar vyavasthapika sabha kii sharan main pahunchaa
 It was now considered that the assembly should be dissolved; a re-election takes place, a new administrative assembly is formed and it gives its decision on the future of monarchy
 isi ke saath vyavasthapika sabha ko samaapt kar diya gaya or vayask matadhikaar ke aadhaar par rashtriya kanveshan kaa gathan hua
 The first session of the National Convention was held on 21 September 1792
 isamen jacobiyan evam jirodist dal pramukh the
 The Jacobians were disciplined and organized
 paris kii bheed par inkaa prabhaav tha
 The main leaders in this were - Dante, Robspier, Heater, etc
 duusari taraf jirondist the- ye shikshit or susanskrit log the
 He had more book knowledge
 faltah ye vyaavhaarik raajnneetijna nahin the
 The prominent leaders were - Isnar, Madame Roland, Brisco etc
 yahaan samajhane kii baat yah he ki donon hi gut ganatantr ke himachati the, videshi shaktiyon ke viruddh yuddh kaa samarthan karte the
 The difference was only in form
 vastutah jirodisto ne france main udaaravaadi sthaan grahan kar liya tha
 He believed that the revolution had gone far ahead and should end
 ve or adhik saamaajik samanta laane ke viruddh the
 He emphasized more on freedom
 udhar jacobiyan log samanta par adhik jor dete the tathaa nimna virgon ke prati sadbhaavpurn ravaiya rakhte the
 The National Convention had three major problems - foreign invasion, the king's presence, and civil war
 sitambar 1792 main francisi sena ne belgium par adhikaar kar liya or dakshin main nise or sevoy bhi uske adhikaar main aa gaye
 Holland, Austria, Prussia and England were terrified by these victories
 krantikariyon ne 1792 main ghoshnaa bhi kar di ki france kaa ganatantr swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kii bhaawanaaon par aadhaarit he or in bhaawanaaon kaa prasar karnaa vah apana kartavya samajhataa he
 France will implement revolutionary principles and seize the property of priests and nobles in the places where it will dominate and whichever country opposes it will be considered as the revolution
 is ghoshnaa se europe ke nirankush rajtantri desh bhaybheet ho gaye or ab france kii kranti france kii na hokar puure europe kii ho gai
 Therefore, the European countries united to stop the spread of revolution and a faction of England, Holland, Austria, Prussia was formed against France
 is gut ne kai jagahon par france ko parajeet kiya
 Consequently, France's defeat in a foreign war became a major problem before the National Convention
 neshnal kanvension ne ek prastaav paarit kar rajtantr ko samaapt kiya or ganatantr kii sthapana kii
 The king was tried for treason and sentenced to death
 raja ke vadh ke prashn par jirondixton kii niti spasht nahin thi
 He was opposed to the monarchy but was talking about a referendum on the question of slaughter
 iske vipareet jacobiyans kaa mat tha ki raja kaa deshadroh siddh ho chukaa he
 Therefore, he should be given death sentence
 atantah 21 janvari 1793 ko lui 16waan faansee par chadha diya gaya
 The National Convention also faced the problem of conflict between the Jacobians and the Zirodists
 vastutah yuddh ke kaaran france aarthik sankat se ghir gaya tha, keemten bad gai thi jisase kanveshan ne raahat dene ke liye vidhaan banaaya, amiron se karj vasuulne kaa niyam banaaya
 These steps were opposed by the Jirandists
 jab jacobio ne paris kii bheed or commune kii sahaayta se kanvension par akraman kar satta par adhikaar kiya or jirondixto ko giraftaar kar aatank ke rajya kii sthapana kii
 With the establishment of the 'state of Terror', France once again fell into disarray
 robspier ke netritv main isaki sthapana kii gai thi
 In this revolutionary, public security was established and anyone who worked against the Jacobs would be punished with death penalty
 robspier ruson kii vichaardhaara se prabhavit tha
 According to which "common desire" is universal desire
 robspier ne satta par niyantran rakhane ke liye virodhiyon ko “gilotin” par chadha diya
 So all the people became suspicious about their lives
 antat july 1794, main robspier kaid kar liya gaya or faansee de di gai isi ke saath aantak ke rajya kii samaapti hui
 The 'state of Thermidorians' was followed by the state of terror
 udaaravaadi thermidorian netaaon ne desh kii satta sanbhali or aantak rajya kii vyavasthaaon ko bhang kiya, jacobiyans ko avaidh ghoshit kiya
 During the rule of terror, control over the price and remuneration imposed was lifted
 jisase keemten punah bad gai, sattebaajon kaa prabhaav bad gaya or pratikriya swaroop vidroh hue lekin in vidronho ko dabaa diya gaya
 Phase III-1794-99 - Rule of "directory" In fact the National Convention formulated a constitution and entrusted the executive responsibility to the 5-member "board of Directors"
 mandal ke sabhi sadasyon ke adhikaar baraabar the
 Each member alternately presided for three months
 prayek varsh ek sadsy kaarykaal samaapt hona tha or uske badale duusare sadsy kii niyukti kii jaani thi
 In this way, the Directory of Rule in France began after the National Convention which lasted from 1795 to 1799
 atan main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kar diya
 This directory rule was disorganized, sad
 sanchaalak mandal ko sashastr senaaon ke niyantran evam senadhyakshon kii niyukti, france kii ore se sandhi karne yaa yuddh karne ke adhikaar praapt the
 The main problem before the Board of Directors was the problem of war, on the other hand the members of the directory were inexperienced, inept and corrupt
 atah diarectory ke shashan kaal main tarah-tarah kii gadabadi faili, bekaari badi, vyapaar thapp pad gaya or uski videsh niti bhi kamjor rahi
