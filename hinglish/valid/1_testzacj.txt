 Apart from these, methods of operational and functional research are prevalent
 salmon ek rang he, jo ki isi naam ke praani ke maance ke rang ke aadhaar par diya gaya he
 Salmon brajabuli us kavyabhasha kaa naam he jiskaa upyog uttar bharat ke purvi pradeshon arthath mithila, bengal, assam tathaa urisa ke bhakt kavi pradhan rup se krishna kii lilaon ke varnan ke liye karte rahe hai
 Some poems and plays written in Brajbuli have also been found in Nepal
 is kavyabhasha kaa upyog shatabdiyon tak hota rahaa he
 From the 15th century to the 19th century AD, verses written in this poetry are found
 yadhyapi "brajabuli sahitya" kii lambii parampara rahi hai, phir bhi "brajabuli" shabd kaa prayog isvi san kii 19veen shatabdi main miltaa he
 So far, the use of this word has been found only in the composition of Bengali poet Ishwar Chandra Gupta
 "brajabuli" shabd kii vyutpatti tathaa brajabuli bhashaa kii utpatti ko lekar vidwaanon main bahut matbhed he
 It is necessary to clarify one thing here that Brajbuli is not Braj Bhasha
 vyakaran sambandhi donon kii apni-apni alag-alag visheshtaayen hai, vaise bhashatattav kii drushti se yah sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki brajabuli kaa sambandh brajabhasha se he
 The use of the words Brajbhasha is seen more in the terms of Brajbuli
 brajabuli kii utpatti avahatth se hui
 It is necessary to get a little information about the non-destructive
 kalkram se apbhransh sahitya kii bhashaa ban chukaa tha, ise 'parinishthit apbhransh' kah sakate hai
 This defined apostrophe had taken the form of a poetic language in northern India from Rajasthan to Assam
 lekin yahan yah bhul nahin janaa chahie ki apbhransh ke vikaas ke saath-saath vibhinn kshentron kii boliyon kaa bhi vikaas ho rahaa tha or baad main chalakar un boliyon main bhi sahitya kii rachana hone lagi
 Thus, the form of apabhramsa which was used between the later dialects and the developed dialects of different regions and which was used for the creation of literature, is called Avahath
 dow sunitikumar chatarji ne batalaaya he ki shauraseni apbhransh arthath avahatth madhyadesh ke alaava bengal aadi pradeshon main bhi kavyabhasha ke rup main apana aadhipaty jamaaye hue tha
 It is necessary to note one thing here, that even though it was accepted as a poetic language, it was natural that the impression of a particular province would be on it, so even if it was a poetic language, we would direct the words of different circles, publication etc
 Huh
 "brajabuli" shabd kii vyutpatti ke sambandh main kuch logon ne anumaan lagaaya he ki "brajavali boli" kaa roopaantar "brajaali buli" main hua or "brajaali buli" "brajabuli" bana
 This is crude fantasy
 vastav main adhik tarksangat yah lagata he ki is bhashaa main krishna kii lilaon kaa varnan he atev krishna kii leelabhumi "braj" ke saath iskaa sambandh jod is bhaash ko "brajaboli" samajha gaya hoga jo banglaa ke uccharan kii vishistataa ke kaaran "brajabuli" ban gaya hoga
 The posts written in Brajbuli have been found in Mithila, Bengal, Assam and Odisha
 asmi sahitya main brajabuli kaa pramukh sthaan he
 Assamese language is inherently mixed in Brajbuli compositions of Assam
 assam ke vaishnav bhakt kaviyon main daasya bhav kii pradhanta he
 They were more influenced by Braj
 bengal tathaa urisa ke bhakt kaviyon main bhi kahin-kahin daasya bhav ke darshan hote hai lekin unamem sakhya or madhur bhav kii pradhanta he
 The vaishnava-shakti-literature of Bengal and Orissa is full of the leelas of Radha and Krishna, but Radha is not given the same place in the Brahmabuli literature of Assamese
 mithila main vidyapati ke padon main radha kii pramukhataa he
 Some plays of Brajbuli have also been found, but these plays have been received only in Nepal and Assam
 bengal yaa urisa main brajabuli ke naatak abhi tak nahin mili hai
 Among the devout poets of Assam, Shankaradeva and his disciple Madhavdev occupy a prominent place
 assam ke janajivan tathaa sahitya par shankardev tathaa unke anuyaayiyon kaa gaharaa prabhaav padaa
 These people made Brajbuli the means of their propaganda
 urisa ke bhakt kaviyon main raay ramanand kaa pramukh sthaan tha
 He was a high official of the Gajapati king Pratap Rudra of Orissa
 chaitanya mahaprabhu or raay ramanand ke milan kaa jo varnan chaitanya sampradaay ke krishnadas kaviraj ne "chaitanya charitamrita" main kiya he usase pataa chalata he ki madhur bhakthi ke rahasyon se donon purna parichit the
 Other poets of Orissa include Prataparudra, Madhavidasi, Rai Champati
 bengal main gaudeey vaishnav sampradaay ke bhakt kaviyon kii sankhya bahut adhik he
 Some of them are: Yashoraj Khan, Murari Gupta, Vasudev Ghosh, Ramanand Basu, Dwij Haridas, Paramanandadas, Gyanadas, Narottamdas, Krishnadas Kaviraj, Govindaraj Kaviraj

 The Aresibo Observatory is a type of radio telescope set up near the city of Aresibo, Puerto Rico
 yah rashtriya vigyaan foundation ke saath sahyog samjhaute ke tahat es
 aar
ai
 international dwaara sanchalit he
 This observatory is also known as National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center
 haalanki "NAIC" naam vedhashala or usamen kaam karne vaale karmchaaree donon ko sanderbhit karata he
 The Observatory's 305-meter radio telescope is the world's largest single gasket telescope
 isamen teen pramukh kshetron par anusandhan kiya jaataa he : radio khagol vigyaan, aronomi or radar khagol vigyaan | The locale of this observatory was used in James Bond's famous film 'golden Eye'
 aresibo doordarshee kii sahaayta se kai mahatvapurn vaigyanik khojein kii gai he - Terminology related to astronomy veydant gyanayog kii ek shakha he jo vyakti ko gyaan prapti kii disha main utprerit karata he
 Its main source is the Upanishads, which are considered to be the essence of Vedas and Aranyak texts
 upanishad vaidic sahitya kaa antim bhaag he, isiilie isko veydant kehete hai
 The description of rituals and worship is mainly in mantras and Brahmins, knowledge is interpreted in Upanishads
 'veydant' kaa shabdic arth he - 'vedon kaa ant' 
 The three branches of Vedanta that are most well known are: Advaita Vedanta, Specific Advaita and Dvaita
 aadi shankaracharya, ramanuj or shri madhwacharya jinako kramash: in tino shakhaon kaa pravartak mana jaataa he, inke alaava bhi gyanayog kii anya shakhaayen hai
 These branches are known as their promoters, including Bhaskar, Vallabh, Chaitanya, Nimbaraka, Vachaspati Mishra, Sureshwar and Vigyan Bhikshu
 aadhunik kaal main jo pramukh vedanti huye hai unamem ramakrishna paramhans, swami vivekanand, arvind ghosh, swami shivanand raja rammohan roy or raman maharishi ullekhneey hai
 These modern thinkers represent the Advaita Vedanta branch
 duusare vedanto ke pravartakon ne bhi apane vichaaron ko bharat main bhalibhanti prachaarit kiya he parantu bharat ke baahar unhen bahut kam janaa jaataa he
 'vedanta' literally means 'the end of the Vedas'
 armbh main upanishdon ke liye ‘veydant’ shabd kaa prayog hua kintu baad main upanishdon ke siddhanton ko aadhaar maanakar jin vichaaron kaa vikaas hua, unke liye bhi ‘veydant’ shabd kaa prayog hone laga
 Three reasons are often given for the use of the word 'vedanta' for the Upanishads: - acharya udaiveer shastri ke anusaar ‘veydant’ pad kaa taatpary he- It has been said above that the word 'vedanta' was originally used for the Upanishads
 alag-alag samhitaon tathaa unki shakhaon se sambaddh anek upanishad hamen praapt hai
 The main and ancient ones are - Ish, Cane, Kath, Mundak, Mandukya, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Chandogya and Brihadaranyaka
 in upanishdon ke darshanik siddhanton main kaaphi kuch samanta he kintu anek sthanon par virodh bhi prathit hota he
 Over time, the need was felt that unanimous teachings should be compiled by co-ordinating the ideas which seem to be opposing
 isi aavashyaktaa kii purti ke liye baadaraayan vyas ne brahmasutra kii rachana kii jise veydant sutara, sharirakasutra, sharirakamimasaa yaa uttarmimasaa bhi kaha jaataa he
 In it, the principles of the Upanishads have been compiled very briefly, in formulaic form
 atyadhik sankshep hone ke kaaran sutron main apane aap main aspashtataa he or unhen bina bhashya yaa tikaa ke samajhnaa sambhav nahin he
 That is why many commentators tried to clarify their intentions by their respective languages, but they had their own viewpoints in this explanation and that is why they differ enough
 prayek ne yah siddh karne kii cheshtaa kii ki uskaa bhashya hi brahmasutron ke vaastavik arth kaa spashtikaran karata he
 As a result, all the commentators became promoters of the Vedanta sect
 inamen pramukh he shankar kaa advaitvaad, ramanuj kaa vishishtadvaitvaad, madhv kaa dwaitvaad, nimbark kaa dwaitadvaitvaad tathaa vallabh kaa shuddhadvaitvaad
 Within these languages, there was a series of commentaries on these languages and commentaries on these languages
 apane-apane sampradaay ke mat ko pusht karne ke liye anek swatantra granthon kii bhi rachana hui, jinase veydant kaa sahitya atyant vishaal ho gaya
 Historically, for a teacher to become / understand Acharya, he has to write commentaries or commentaries on the books of Vedanta
 in pustakon main teen mahatvapurn pustak shaamil hai upanishad, bhagavad gita or brahmasutra, jinhen prasthaantrayee kehete hai
 Accordingly, Adi Shankaracharya, Ramanuja and Madhvacharya have all given specific compositions on these three important books
 teenon granthon main pragat vichaaron kaa kai tarah se vyaakhyaan kiya ja saktaa he
 For this reason, many opinions regarding Brahm, Jiva and Jagat were presented and in this way many forms of Vedanta were created
 gaudpad tathaa unke anuvarthi aadi shankaracharya brahm ko pradhan maanakar jeev or jagat ko usase abhinn maanate hai
 According to him the element should be devoid of origin and destruction
 nashvan jagat tatvashoonya he, jeev bhi jaisaa dikhaai detaa he vaisaa tatvat: nahin he
 In the awakened and self-awakening, the living organism lives in the world, but in sleep, the living entity remains in a conscious state
 isse siddh hota he ki jeev kaa shuddh rup sushupti jaisaa hona chahie
 The state of sleep is impermanent, so beyond this, Turiyavastha is considered pure form of life
 is avasthaa main nashwar jagat se koi sambandh nahin hota or jeev ko pun: nashwar jagat main pravesh bhi nahin karnaa padataa
 This Turiyavastha derives from practice
 brahm-jeev-jagat main abhed kaa gyaan utpann hone par jagat jeev main tathaa jeev brahm main leen ho jaataa he
 Despite the real imperviousness of the three, the organism considers the world separate from itself due to ignorance
 parantu swapnsansar kii tarah jaagrath sansar bhi jeev kii kalpana he
 The only difference is that the dream is the result of personal imagination, while the awakened experience - the macro - past superconception
 swapnjagat kaa gyaan hone par donon main mithyaatv siddh he
 But like the Buddhists, in Vedanta the creature is not considered false due to being part of the world
 mithyaatv kaa anubhav karanevaala jeev param satya he, use mithyaa maanane par sabhi gyaan ko mithyaa maananaa hoga
 But the form in which an organism behaves in the world is false
 jeev kii turiyavastha bhedagyaan shunya shuddhavastha he
 The relation of the knower-known-knowledge is a false relationship
 inase pare hokar jeev apni shuddh chetnavastha ko praapt hota he
 In this state there is not even a trace of difference because the distinction is in the duality
 isi advait avasthaa ko brahm kehete hai
 The element is infinite, if the second element is also there, then the limit of the first element will be limited and by being limited, that element will be intelligible in which the distinction of knowledge-knowledge-knowledge will be reflected
 anubhav sakshi he ki sabhi gyey vastuen nashwar hai
 Therefore, if we consider the element to be imperishable, then we have to consider it to be invisible, unknowable, pure consciousness
 aise tatv ko maanakar jagat kii anubhuymaan sthiti kaa hamen vivartvaad ke sahaar vyaakhyaan karnaa hoga
 Like the serpent reverberating in the rope, this world is neither true nor discrete
 sat hota to iskaa kabhi naash na hota, asat hota to sukh, du:kha kaa anubhav na hota
 Therefore, the unique unconditional state can be the actual state from the seventh discrete
 upanishdon main neti kahkar isi agyatavastha kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 Ignorance is a form of feeling because it leads to the achievement of the existence of an object, it is a form of absence, because its actual form is nothing
 isi agyaan ko jagat kaa kaaran mana jaataa he
 The exact answer to what ignorance has to do with Brahma is difficult, but Brahma in its pure formless ignorance is not without ignorance, somehow he becomes enlightened by eccentric ignorance to be called a virtuous God and thus the universe becomes active
 ishwar ko apane shuddh rup kaa gyaan hota he parantu jeev ko apane brahmroop kaa gyaan praapt karne ke liye sadhana ke dwaara brahmibhoot hona padataa he
 On hearing the sermon of 'tattvamsi' from the mouth of the Guru, the creature experiences 'aham Brahmasmi'
 us avasthaa main sampurna jagat ko aatmamay tathaa apane main sampoorn jagat ko dekhtaa he kyonki us samay uske ke atirikt koi tatv nahin hota
 This state is called Turiyavastha or Moksha
 ramanujacharya ne shankar mat ke vipareet yah kaha ki ishwar swatantra tatv he parantu jeev bhi satya he, mithyaa nahin
 These creatures are associated with God
 unka yah sambandh bhi agyaan ke kaaran nahin he, vah vaastavik he
 Even if there is salvation, the organism remains independent
 bhautik jagat or jeev alag alag rup se satya hai parantu ishwar kii satyata inaki satyata se vilakshan he
 Brahma is complete, the world is rooted, the creature is surrounded by ignorance and sorrow
 ye teenon milakar ekaakaar ho jate hai kyonki jagat or jeev brahm ke sharir hai or brahm inaki aatma tathaa niyantaa he
 They do not exist apart from Brahma, they are only there to serve Brahma
 is darshan main advait kii jagah bahutv kii kalpana he parantu brahm anek main ekta sthapit karanevaala ek tatv he
 Due to the rendering of the unique Advaha Brahman by the plurality, it is called the Vividhavaita
 vishishtadvait mat main bhedarahit gyaan asambhav mana gaya he
 That is why Shankar's pure Adva Brahm is not acceptable in this view
 brahm savishesh he or uski visheshta isamen he ki usamen sabhi sat gun vidyaman hai
 Therefore, Brahma is actually a physical God
 sabhi vaiyaktik atmaaen satya hai or inhen se brahm kaa sharir nirmit he
 It does not dissolve in Brahman, on salvation
 Their existence remains intact
 is tarah brahm anekta main ekta sthapit karanevaala sutara he
 This Brahm is situated in the causal form with the subtle and spirits in the Holocaust period, but takes a subtle physical form in the universe
 yahi kaary brahm kaha jaataa he
 The Brahman with infinite knowledge and bliss is called Narayana who resides in Baikuntha along with Lakshmi
 bhakthi ke dwaara is narayan ke sameep pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 The best devotion derives from Narayana's offerings and is Bhagavad Gyanamaya
 bhakthi maarg main jati-varna-gat bhed kaa sthaan nahin he
 This is the highway to God for all
 madhv ne dwait veydant kaa prachaar kiya jisamen paanch bhedon ko aadhaar mana jaataa he- jeev ishwar, jeev jeev, jeev jagat, ishwar jagat, jagat jagat
 The distinction among them is proven automatically
 bhed ke bina vastu kii sthiti asambhav he
 The world and creatures are separate from God but controlled by God
 sagun ishwar jagat kaa srashta, paalak or sanhaarak he
 The game of creation runs at the behest of God who is pleased with devotion
 yadhyapi jeev swabhaavat: gyaanamay or aanandamay he parantu sharir, man aadi ke sansarg se ise du:kha bhogana padataa he
 This occurs as a result of contact deeds
 jeev ishvarniyantrit hone par bhi karta or falbhokta he
 Devotion is eternal love in God, through which the creature is freed, situated near God, and has bliss
 bhautik jagat ishwar ke adheen he or ishwar kii ichha se hi sristi or pralay main yah kramash: sthool or sookshm avasthaa main sthit hota he
 Madhva, like Ramanuja, does not consider the creature and the world to be the body of Brahma
 ye swat:sthit tatv hai
 The difference between them is real
 ishwar keval inkaa niyantran karata he
 In this philosophy, Brahmo is the cause of the world, nature is the cause of gratitude
 nimbark kaa darshan ramanuj se atyadhik prabhavit he
 Jeeva is the form of knowledge and knowledge
 jeev or gyaan main dharmi-dharm-bhav-sambadh athwa bhedabhed sambandh mana gaya he
 This is the knower, the doer and the bhakta
 ishwar jeev kaa niyantaa, bharta or sakshi he
 When knowledge arises from devotion, a creature free from the sorrow of the world attains the likeness of God
 aprakrit bhoot se ishwar kaa sharir tathaa praakrit bhoot se jagat kaa nirmaan hua he
 Kaal is considered the third ghost
 ishwar ko krishna radha ke rup main mana gaya he
 Animals and ghosts are part of it
 yahi upadan or nimit kaaran he
 There is also a difference between the living world and God
 yadi jeev-jagat tathaa ishwar ek hote to ishwar ko bhi jeev kii tarah ksht bhogana padataa
 If it were different then how would God be called the omnipresent all-round soul? vallabh ke is mat main brahm swatantra tatv he
 Sachchidananda Sri Krishna is the Brahman and the living beings and the world are part of him
 vahi anoraniyan tathaa mahato mahiyan he
 She is also one, and also a maternal grandfather
 vahi apni ichha se apane aap ko jeev or jagat ke naanaa roopon main prakat karata he
 Maya is his power, with the help of which he is many
 parantu anek mithyaa nahin he
 The nature of the living world arises from Shri Krishna
 is utpatti se shrikrishna main koi vikaar nahin utpann hota
 The relationship of the living world and God is related to the spark of fire
 ishwar ke prati sneh bhakthi he
 It is the duty of a living being to take a attachment to God by taking disinterest from worldly things
 ishwar ke anugrah se hi yah bhakthi prapya he, bhakt hona jeev ke apane vash main nahin he
 When God becomes pleased, he takes the creature inside himself or keeps it with him to consume daily
 is bhaktimaarg ko pushtimaarg bhi kehete hai
 In this sect of Mahaprabhu Chaitanya, infinite virtues, Sachchidananda Sri Krishna Parbrahma are considered
 brahm bhedathit hai
 But by his power he emerges as a creature and a world
 ye brahm se bhinn or abhinn hai
 That in itself is the reason, but due to its contact with power, it is also the factor
 uski tatasthshakti se jeevon kaa tathaa mayasakti se jagat kaa nirmaan hota he
 Organisms are infinite and atomic forms
 yah surya kii kirnon kii tarah ishwar par nirbhar hai

 a newspaper or a newspaper is a publication based on news, in which information, mainly current affairs, politics, sports, personalities, advertisements, etc
, are printed on cheap paper
 samachar patr sanchaar ke sadhano main mahatvapurn sthaan rakhte hai
 Newspapers are usually daily, but some newspapers are weekly, fortnightly, monthly and even half-yearly
 adhiktar samachaarpatr sthaneey bhashaaon main or sthaneey vishyon par kendrit hote hai
 The earliest known newspaper was 59 BC
 Is 'the Roman Acta Diurna'
 julies sisar ne janasadhran ko mahatvapurn rajnatijna or samaajik ghatnaon se avgat karaane ke liye unhe shahro ke pramukh sthano par preshit kiya
 Handwritten newspapers were introduced in China in the 8th century
 akhbaar kaa itihaas or yogadan: yun to british shashan ke ek purv adhikari ke dwaara akhabaaron kii shuruyaat maani jaati he, lekin uskaa swaroop akhabaaron kii tarah nahin tha
 It was only a one-page informational paper
 purnroopen akhbaar bengal se 'bengal-gajet' ke naam se vysarai hikki dwaara nikaala gaya tha
 Initially, the British used newspapers for their own benefit, as all newspapers were coming out in English, so news and information could not reach the majority of people
 jo khabaren baahar nikalakar aati thintra se guzarate, vahaan apana aatank failaate rahete the
 There were neither cases nor any punishment against them
 in naarkeey paristhitiyon ko jhelte hue bhi log khamosh the
 During this period, newspapers such as 'the Hindustan Times', 'national Herald', 'pioneer', 'mumbai-mirror' in India used to come out in English, in which there was no mention of those atrocities
 in angreji patron ke atirikt bangala, urdu aadi main patron kaa prakaashan to hota rahaa, lekin uskaa dayera simit tha
 Only a Bengali reader or a person who knew Urdu could understand it
 aise main pehali baar 30 may 1826 ko hindi kaa pratham patr ‘udant martand’ kaa pehla ank prakashit hua
 This letter was weekly
 ‘udant-martand' kii shuruyaat ne bhashaayi str par logon ko ek sutara main baandhane kaa prayaas kiya
 It was not just a letter, but the tongue of thousands of people who were still silent and frightened
 hindi main patron kii shuruyaat se desh main ek krantikari parivartan hua or aazaadee kii jang
 They were twisted and presented so that the news of the atrocities of the British Government would be suppressed
 angrej sipaahi kisi bhi kshetra main ghuskar manamaana vyavhaar karte the
 Incidents like robbery, murder, rape were common
 wo jis bhi ksheko bhi ek nai disha mili
 Now people started getting information about the events happening in the corner of the country
 lekin kuch hi samay baad is patr ke sampadak jugal kishor ko sahaayta ke abhaav main 11 disambar 1827 ko patr band karnaa padaa
 On 10 May 1829, the Hindi newspaper Bangdoot was published from Bengal
 yah patr bhi logon kii aawaaj bana or unhen jode rakhane kaa madhyam
 After this, in July 1854, Shyamsunder Sen published the 'samachar Sudha Varshana' from Calcutta
 us dauraan jin bhi akhabaaron ne angreji hukumat ke khilaaf koi bhi khabar yaa aalekh chapa, use uski keemat chukaani padi
 Newspapers were banned
 uski pratiyaan jalawaai jaati thim, uske prakashkon, sampadakon, lekhakon ko dand diya jaataa tha
 He was fined heavily so that he could not muster the courage to rise again
 aazaadee kii lahar jis tarah puure desh main fail rahi thi, akhbaar bhi atyaacharon ko sahakar or mukhar ho rahe the
 This was the reason that after partition of Bengal, the voice of Hindi letters became more elevated
 lokmaanya tilak ne 'kesari' kaa sampadan kiya or lala lajpat raay ne punjab se 'vande maataram' patr nikaala
 These letters called for greater cooperation in the freedom struggle of the youth
 in patron ne aazaadee paane kaa ek jajba paidaa kar diya
 'kesari' was removed from Nagpur by Madhavrao Sapre, but the letter was banned due to Tilak's provocative articles
 uttar bharat main aazaadee kii jang main jaan phunkane ke liye ganesh shankar vidhyaarthee ne 1913 main kanpur se saptahik patr 'pratap' kaa prakaashan aarambh kiya
 It used to publish information about atrocities in every part of the country
 isse logon main aakrosh bhadakne laga tha or ve british hukumat ko ukhaad phenkane ke liye or bhi utsahit ho uthe the
 In view of its aggression, the British administration gave various harassment to its writers and editors, but this paper remained on its target
 isi prakaar bengal, bihar, maharashtra ke kshetron se patron kaa prakaashan hota rahaa
 Those letters tried to spread the urge for people to gain freedom and spread awareness
 agar yah kaha jaae ki swatantraaa senaniyon ke liye ye akhbaar kisi hathiyaar se kamatar nahin the, to koi atishyokti nahin hogi
 The freedom weapon of the newspaper became as independent and outspoken as the press is today, it was bound by restrictions and restrictions in the freedom struggle
 na to usamen manoranjan kaa put tha or na hi ye kisi kii kamai kaa jariya hi
 These newspapers and magazines were a weapon and medium of freedom fighters, which kept them connected to people and events
 aazaadee kii ladaai kaa koi bhi aisa yoddha nahin tha, jisane akhabaaron ke jariye apni baat kehane kaa prayaas na kiya ho
 Gandhiji also published newspapers in the name of 'harijan', 'young-india', while Maulana Abul Kalam Azad published 'al-hilal'
 aise or kitne hi udhaaharan hai, jo yah sabit karte hai ki patr-patrikaon kii aazaadee kii ladaai main mahati bhoomika thi
 This was a period when people had no means of communication
 us par bhi angrejon ke atyaacharon ke shikaar asahaay log chupchaap saare atyachar sehate the
 Neither one was going to listen to them nor to defeat their sorrows
 wo kehete bhi to kisase or kaise? har koi to usee pratadna ko jhel rahe the
 In such a situation, the introduction of magazines and magazines gave courage to the people, and encouraged them
 yahi kaaran tha ki krantikariyon ke ek-ek lekh janata main nai sphurti or deshbhakti kaa sanchaar karte the
 When Bharatendu's play 'bharat-plight' was published, people got to experience how the people of India are going through and what is the intention of the British

 ye kramshah utak vigyaan or sthaan hai
 Common category examples include: in main se adhikansh ganthen bacchon main aam hai
 The names of dormant knots typically use words such as -carcinoma, -sarcoma or -blastoma as suffixes, with the Latin or Greek word for organ of origin as the root word
 udhaaharan ke liye, yakrut kaa karkat hepetocarcinoma kehalaata he; vasa koshikaon kaa karkat liposarcoma kehalaata he
 For common cancers, the English name of the organ is used

 Cancer is a class of different diseases that vary widely in their causes and biology
 koi bhi jeev, yahaan tak ki paudhon, main bhi karkat cancer ho saktaa he
 Almost all cancer cancers grow slowly, cancer and cancer cells and its daughter cells cause an error
 koi bhi cheez jo pratikruti karti he sambhavatya trutiyon se peedit ho sakati hai 
 yadi truti sudhaar or rokthaam thik prakaar se na kiya jaye trutiyaan bani rahengi or putree koshikaon ko bhi sthanantarit ho sakati hai
 Generally, the body tries to avoid against cancer through several methods, such as: apoptosis, accessory molecules, possibly chronicity, etc
 haalanki ye truti sudhaar vidhiyaan chote myanon main aksar asafal ho jaati hai, vishesh rup se aise vaataavaran main jahaan trutiyon ke utpann hone or badhane kii sambhaavnaaen adhik hoti hai
 For example, such an atmosphere may contain disruptive elements known as carcinogens
 yaa aavadhik chot ho sakati he, yaa vaataavaran jisamen koshikaayen apane astitv ke liye viksit nahin hui hon, jaise hypoxia 
 In this way, cancer is a progressive disease and these progressive errors keep accumulating in the cell gradually until the cell present in the animal starts to work in opposite to its functions
 ve trutiyaan jo karkat kaa kaaran hoti hai, aksar swa-pravardhansheel hoti hai, antat ek ghaateey dar par badhati hai
 for example: is prakaar se karkat aksar kuch trutiyon ke kaaran ek shrinkhalaa abhikriya ke rup main visphotit hota he, ye trutiyaan sanyukt hokar adhik gambhir trutiyaan banaati hai
 Errors that cause more errors are effectively the root cause of cancer and, at the same time, the reason that cancer treatment is very difficult: even after killing all of the cancer's 10,000,000,000 cells
 , Only 10 cells of them can do their replication or send the error-causing signals to other cells then the process starts again

 Fifty known carcinogens, including nitrosamine and multicomponent hydrocarbons, are found in tobacco smoking
 Tobacco is responsible for one in three cancer deaths in the developed world, and about one in five deaths worldwide

 Many cancers are caused by a virus infection; This is especially seen in birds such as animals, but also in humans, viruses are responsible for 15% of human cancers worldwide
 maanav ke cancer se sambandhit mukhya virus hai maanav pepiloma virus, hepatitis bi or hepatitis si virus, epstin-baar virus or maanav tii -limphotropic virus
 Experimental and epidemiological data indicate a causative role of viruses and have emerged as the second most important risk factor for the development of cancer in humans, with the first factor being tobacco use
 virus-prerit ganthon ko do prakaaron main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he, tivrata se roopantarit hone vaale or dhire dhire roopantarit hone vaale 
 In rapidly converting viruses, the virus carries a hyperactive oncogene called viral-oncogene and the infected cell quickly mutates with the expression of v-onc
 iske vipareet, dhire dhire roopantarit hone vaale virus main, virus jinom, poshi ke jinom main ek proto-onkosin ke paas pravisht hota he
 Now viral promoters or other transcriptional regulation elements cause over-expression of that proto-oncogene
 isamen aniyantrit koshika vibhaajan shaamil he
 Because the location of insertion is not specific to proto-oncogenes, and no proto-oncogene has a low chance of insertion, slow-converting viruses, as compared to fast-converting viruses, have a longer duration of infection
 Produce knots after time

 anuvanshik parivartan kai staron par ho sakate hai, ye pur gunasutra ke laabh yaa haani ke rup main ho sakate hai, jo utparivartan kaa hi ek rup he or ek maatr DNA neucliotoide ko prabhavit karata he
 There are two broad categories of genes that are affected by these changes
 onkosin saamaanya jin ho sakate hai, jo anupyukt rup se ucch str par prakat hote hai, yaa parivartit jin jinamein noval gun hote hai
 In any case, expression of these genes promotes the malignancy pattern of cancer cells

 There is a diverse classification scheme for different genomic changes, which can contribute to the production of cancer cells
 in main se adhikansh parivartan utparivartan hote hai, yaa jinomik DNA ke newcliotide anukraman main parivartan hote hai
 Aneuploidy, the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes, is a genomic change that is not a mutation and may involve the gain or loss of one or more chromosomes by error in mitosis

 Small-scale mutations include point mutations, decreases or increases, which can occur in the promoter of a gene, affecting its expression
 yaa jin ke anukram koden main ho sakati he or iske protein utpaada ke sthayitv yaa kriya ko roopantarit kar sakati he
 Disruption of the sole gene can result in the integration of genomic material from a DNA virus or retro virus, and this type of event can result in the expression of viral oncogenes in the affected cell and its progeny

 Some oncogenes themselves are part of the signal transit mechanism, or part of the signal receptor in cells and tissues, thus controlling the sensitivity of such hormones
 onkosin aksar samasutrajan utpann karte hai, yaa protein sanshleshan main DNA ke pratilekhan main sanlagn hote hai, jo protein or anzime banaata he, ye protein or anzime un utpaadon or jaev rasayanon ke nirmaan ke liye uttaradaayi hai, jinke saath koshikaayen antarkriya karti hai or jinka koshikaayen upyog karti hai
 Mutations in proto-oncogenes, which are generally the stable equivalents of oncogenes, can modify their expression and action, and the products increase the action or amount of the protein
 jab aisa hota he, aadya-onchogin onchogin ban jate hai or yah sankraman koshika main koshika chakra viniman ke saamaanya santulan ko bigaad detaa he, jisase aniyantrit koshika vruddhi sambhav ho jaati he
 Even if possible, the possibility of cancer cannot be reduced by removing proto-oncogenes from the genome, as they are complex for the growth, repair and establishment of the organism
 aisa keval tab hota he jab ve utparivartit ho jate hai or vruddhi ke sanket atyadhik ho jate hai
 One of the first oncogenes to be defined in cancer research is the Ras oncogene
 Mutations in the Ras family of protein-oncogenes are very common, occurring in 20% to 30% of all human lumps
 raas ko mul rup se harvey sarcoma virus jinom main pahachaanaa gaya tha or shodhakarta is baat se aashcharyachakit ho gaye ki na keval maanav jinom main yah jin upasthiti tha balki, ek utprerak niyantran tatv se judaa hua tha, jo koshika rekha sanvardhan main cancer ko prerit kar saktaa tha
 The knot suppressor gene encodes for anti-proliferation signals and proteins, which suppress mitosis and cell growth
 saamanytah, gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin pratilekhan kaarak hai jo koshikeey tanaav yaa DNA kshati ke dwaara sakriy hote hai
 Often DNA damage can result in the presence of free-radical genetic material as well as other symptoms that induce enzymes and pathways responsible for activation of knot-suppressing genes
 aise jeenon kaa kaary he DNA kii marammat ke liye koshika chakra ke aage badhane par niyantran, jo utparivartan ko putree koshika tak sthanantarit hone se roktaa he
 The p53 protein, one of the most studied knot suppressor genes, is a transcription factor that is activated by several cellular stressors, including hypoxia and ultraviolet radiation damage
 p53 roopantaran main shaamil sabhi canceron ke lagbhag aadhe ke alaava, iske gaanth ke shaman kaary ko bhalee prakaar se samajha nahin gaya he
 Apparently p53 has two functions: one a nuclear role as a transcription factor and the other a cytoplasmic role in regulating cell cycle, cell division and apoptosis
 warburg pariklpana ke anusaar cancer kii vruddhi ke liye urja hetu glycolysis kaa adhimaanya prayog hota he
 p53 regulates the transfer of the glycolytic tract from respiration
 haalanki, ek utparivartan, khud "ise band karte hue" gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin ko yaa is sanket maarg ko kshati pahunchaa saktaa he, jo ise sakriy karata he, is kaa achal parinaam he ki DNA kii marammat baadhit yaa sandamit ho jaati he: marammat rahit diene kshati kaa sangrah nishchit rup cancer kaa kaaran banataa he
 Mutations of the genes that suppress the knot that occur in the germ level cells are transferred to the progeny and increase the likelihood of cancer in subsequent generations
 in pariwaron ke sadasyon ne aisi ghatnaon main vruddhi kii he or isse bahul tumor kii vilambtaa main kami ai he
 The type of knot is typical for each type of mutation that suppresses the knot, with some mutations causing specific types of cancer, while other mutations causing other types of cancer
 utparivarti tumor shaamak kii vanshagati kaa prakaar yah he ki ek prabhavi sadsy ek doshapurn pratilipi ko ek janak se or saamaanya pratilipi ko duusare janak se praapt karata he
 For example, a person who inherits a mutant p53 allele may develop melanoma and pancreatic cancer called li-fraumeni syndrome
 anya vanshaagat gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin syndrome main shaamil he retino blostoma se sambandhit Rb utparivartan or adinopoliposis badi aant ke cancer se jude APC jin utparivartan
adinopoliposis badi aant kaa cancer bachapan kii avasthaa main badi aant main hajaaron polip se sambandhit hai, jo apekshaakrit kam umr main badi aant kaa cancer utpann karte hai
 Finally, hereditary mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 cause early onset of breast cancer
 1971 main yah prastaav diya gaya ki cancer kaa vikaas kam se kam do utparivartan ghatnaon par nirbhar karata he
 According to Knudson's two-injury hypothesis, a hereditary gene level mutation in a gene that is quenching a gene will cause cancer only if another mutation occurs later in the organism's life, it is the gene that suppresses that knot
 Will inactivate other alleles
 aamtaur par, onkosin prabhavi hote hai, kyonki unamem kriya-kaa-laabh utparivartan shaamil hota he, jabaki utparivartit tumor shaamak aprabhavi hote hai, kyonki unamem kriya-kii-haani utparivartan shaamil hota he
 Each cell has two copies of the same gene, each of which is obtained from the parent and in most cases an action-to-gain mutation in only one copy of a particular proto-oncogene, making that gene a true oncogene
 Is sufficient for duusari ore, kriya-kii-haani utparivartan kaa, gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin kii donon pratilipiyon main hona aavashyak he taaki jin ko puri tarah se kriyaaheen banaaya ja sake
 However, there are cases in which a mutated copy of the knot-suppressing gene neutralizes the other wild-type copy
 yah ghatana prabhavi nakaaratmak prabhaav kehalaati he or kai p53 utparivartanon main dekhi jaati he
 Knudson's two-injury model has recently been challenged by several investigators
 gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale kuch jeenon ke ek elil kaa niskriyakaran tumor ko utpann karne ke liye paryaapt he
 This phenomenon is called haploid insufficiency and has been demonstrated by several experimental approaches
 agunit aparyaaptta se utpann hui gaanth kii shuruyaat aam taur par der se hoti he, jab isaki tulana ek ek do chot kii prakriya se kii jaati he
 Often, multiple genetic changes that result in cancer may take several years to accumulate
 is samay ke dauraan, purv durdam koshikaon kaa jaivik vyavhaar dhire dhire saamaanya koshika se badal kar cancer koshika kaa ho jaataa he
 With the help of microscope, differentiating properties can be seen in pre-treated tissue

 These initial tumor changes should be differentiated from overgrowth, which is a mutant increase in cell division due to an external stimulation, such as a hormonal imbalance or chronic irritation
 durvikasita ke sabase gambhir maamalon ko "swasthani karcarbud " kaha jaataa he
 In Latin, the word "in situ" means "in place", so the term carcinoma is in situ, the uncontrolled growth of cells that remain in their original place and have not shown any invasion of other tissues
 phir bhi, carcinoma swasthani ek aakraamak durdamata main viksit ho saktaa he or yadi sambhav ho to ise aam taur par shalya kriya ke dwaara hataa diya jaataa he
 Just as the growth occurs in animal populations, so does growth in uncontrolled populations of cells
 yah avaanchhneeya prakriya kayik vikaas kehalaati he or isi tarah se cancer utpann hota he or adhik durdam ban jaataa he
 Most changes in cellular metabolism that cause irregular cell division are the cause of cell death

 Similarly, pathogens such as MRSA become antibiotic-resistant and this is why crop blight and pests become resistant to pesticides
 isi vikaas ke kaaran cancer punrariti main aisi koshikaayen hoti hai jo cancer kii dawaaon ke liye pratirodh praapt kar leti hai In a 2000 article by Hannahan and Weinberg, the biological properties of the sore knot cells were summarized as follows: in bahul padon kaa puraa hona nimna ke bina ek bahut hi durlabh ghatana hogi: These biological changes are predominant in carcinoma; Other hard knots may not be all that is needed to achieve them

 Different positions do not necessarily represent individual mutations
 For example, inactivation of a genus will cause codons for the p53 protein, genomic instability, apoptosis, and increased angiogenesis
 cancer kii sabhi koshikaayen vibhajit nahin hoti hai
 Rather, a sub-set of cells in a knot is called the cancerous stem cells, which replicate on their own and form differentiated cells
 cancer kii rokthaam ko, cancer kii ghatnaon main kami laane ke liye sakriy upayon ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 For this, avoiding cancer or altering their metabolism, adopting a lifestyle or diet that modifies cancer-causing factors and / or medical intervention may be useful
 "rokthaam" kii mahamari vigyaan avadharana ko saamanyatya yaa to un logon ke liye praathmik rokthaam ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he jinamein kisi vishesh rog kaa nidaan nahin kiya gaya he, yaa dwitiyak rokthaam ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he, jo pehle se nidaan kiye gaye rog kii jatiltaaon ko kam karata he
 Most of the cancer risk factors are related to the environment or lifestyle in nature, claiming that cancer is a widely preventable disease

 According to a public health perspective, cervical cancer screening through pap smears is more beneficial in price than all other types of cancer, it is largely caused by a virus, there are obvious risk factors, such as cancer
 The natural way of spreading is that it usually spreads slowly over many years, so the screening program can quickly catch it
 To take more time

 These tests can provide information about the molecular changes that have taken place in the cancer cell and thus indicate the future behavior and best treatment of the cancer
 cancer kaa upachaar shalya chikitsa, rasochikitsa, vikiran chikitsa, pratiraksha chikitsa, monochlonal antibody chikitsa yaa anya vidhiyon ke dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 The choice of therapy depends on the condition and range of the knot and the stage of the disease, as well as the general state of the patient
 Many experimental cancer treatments are also being developed
 sharir ko nuksaan pahuchaye bina cancer ko puri tarah se khatm karnaa upachaar kaa uddeshy hota he
 Sometimes this can be done surgically, but the tendency of the cancer to invade nearby tissue or spread to distant locations by microscopic metastasis often limits its effectiveness

 Theoretically, non-hematological cancer can be treated if it is completely removed by surgery, but this is not always possible
 jab cancer shalya chikitsa se pehle hi metastasis ke dwaara sharir ke anya angon tak pahunch jaataa he, tab puri tarah se shalya kriya dwaara ise hataa dena aam taur par asambhav hota he
 In the halted sample of cancer progression, the knot grows spatially, then spreads to the lymph nodes, and then to all other parts of the body
 For this reason, the popularity of endemic treatments such as surgery for small cancers has increased
 yahan tak ki chote sthaniyakrut tumor main bhi metastasis kii bahut adhik kshamta hoti he
 Examples of surgical procedures for cancer include - breast amputation for breast cancer and prostate-piercing for prostate cancer
 The goal of surgery is to either remove the knot or remove the entire organ
 a cancer cell is invisible to the naked eye, but can then grow into a new knot, a process known as recurrence

 The goal of radiation therapy is to destroy as many cancer cells as possible, while limiting damage to nearby healthy tissue
 isliye, yah kai bhaagon main di jaati he jisase bich kii avadhi main swasth utakon ko thik hone kaa mauka mil jaataa he
 Radiation therapy can be used to treat almost every type of solid lump, including cancers of the brain, breast, cervix, larynx, lung, pancreas, prostate, skin, abdomen, uterus, or soft tissue sarcoma
 
 leukemia or limphoma ke upachaar main bhi vikiran chikitsa kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 The radiation dose for each site depends on many factors, these factors are, the radio sensitivity of each type of cancer and whether the surrounding tissue or organs can be destroyed by radiation
 is prakaar, har prakaar ke upachaar main, vikiran chikitsa iske parshv dushprabhavon ke bina nahin he
 Cancer treatment of cancer is done in medicines which can destroy cancer cells

 Rheumatic drugs inhibit cell division in various possible ways, for example by replication of DNA or segregation of newly formed chromosomes
 Most forms of chemotherapy target all cells that rapidly divide, specific only to cancer cells
 Are not, although some specificity is due to the fact that most cancer cells are not capable of repairing DNA damage
 Whereas normal cells typically have these abilities
 atah, rasochikitsa main swasth utakon ko nuksaan pahunchane kii kshamta hoti he, vishesh rup se ve utak jinamein ucch pratisthaapan dar hoti he 
ye koshikaayen aamtaur par rasochikitsa ke baad apni marammat kar leti hai
 Because some drugs work better together than alone, two or more drugs are given at the same time

 lakshith therapy jo 1990 ke dashak ke ant main sabase pehle uplabdh hui, kaa kai prakaar ke cancer ke upachaar main mukhya prabhaav tha or vartmaan main yah ek bahut hi adhik sakriy anusandhan kshetra he
 This includes the use of factors that are specialized to unregulate the proteins of cancer cells
 chote anu lakshith upachaar dawaayein aamtaur par cancer koshikaon ke bheetar utparivartit, ati abhivyakt, yaa anya jatil proteinon par anzymetic domen kii sandamak hoti hai
 Major examples are the thyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib and zefitinib
 monochlonal pratirakshi chikitsa ek anya ranneeti he jisamen upachaar kaa kaarak ek pratirakshi hota he jo cancer koshikaon kii sataha par ek protein ke saath vishesh rup se bandha bana letaa he
 Examples include anti-her2 / neu antibody trastuzumeb used in breast cancer and anti-cd-20 antibody rituximeb used in many types of B-cell malignancies
 lakshith therapy main "homing yukti" ke rup main chote peptid bhi shaamil ho sakate hai, jo gaanth ke chaaron ore prabhavit bahya koshiki matrix ke saath yaa koshika kii sataha par grahi ke saath baandh bana sakate hai
 Radio nuclides that are attached to these peptides eventually kill the cancer cell if the nucleus is decomposing around the cell
 vishesh rup se in bandhit padaarthon ke oligo- yaa multimers bahut mahatvapurn hote hai, chunki ve gaanth kii vishistataa or uthkanthaa ko badhaate hai
 Photodynamic therapy is a triple treatment for cancer that includes photosensitizers, tissue oxygen, and light
 PDT kaa upyog aadhari koshika carcinoma yaa fefdon ke cancer ke upachaar ke liye kiya jaataa he; PDT bade tumor ko shalya chikitsa ke dwaara hataa die jane ke baad durdam utak ke bache hue avasheshon ko hataane main bhi upyogi ho saktaa he
 Cancer immune therapy is a group of different medical strategies designed to induce a patient's own immune system to fight the knot
 gaanth ke khilaaf pratirakshi pratikriya utpann karne ke liye kai vidhiyaan hai, ye hai, satahi mutrashi cancer ke liye antar dhaneey BCG pratiraksha chikitsa, tathaa vrikk koshika carcinoma or melanoma ke rogiyon main pratirakshi pratikriya prerit karne ke liye interferon or anya cytokine kaa upyog
 kai prakaar kii ganthon, khaas taur par durdam melanoma or vrikk koshika carcinoma, ke liye vishisht pratiraksha pratikriya utpann karne ke liye vexinon par gahan anusandhan kiya ja rahaa he
 cephalucal-t is a vaccine-like strategy used in modern clinical trials for prostate cancer, in which thrushmash cells taken from the patient are loaded with prostatic acid phosphatase peptides to induce a specific immune response against prostate-derived cells
 To be
 elloginenic hemetopoctic stem koshika pratyaropan ko pratiraksha therapy kaa ek rup mana ja saktaa he, kyonki daata kii pratiraksha koshikaayen grapht-banaam-gaanth prabhaav ke tahat gaanth par aksar akraman karti hai

 Angiogenesis that is required for the tumor to survive
 kuch, jaise bevasizumeb, ko manyata de di gayi he or chikitsakeey upyog main inkaa upyog kiya ja rahaa he
 a main problem with anti-angiogenesis drugs is that many factors stimulate the growth of blood vessels in normal and cancerous cells
 angiogenesis virdohi dawaaye keval ek hi kaarak ko lakshya banaati hai, isliye anya kaarak rakt vahini kii vruddhi ko uttejit karnaa jari rakhte hai
 Other problems include route of administration, maintenance of stability and action and targeting on tumor vasculature
 yadhyapi cancer ke lakshanon par niyantran ko cancer kaa upachaar nahin mana ja saktaa he, yah cancer rogiyon kii jivan kii gunvattta kaa ek mahatvapurn nirdharak he or is faisle main mukhya bhoomika nibhaataa he ki rogi anya upachaar ke liye sakasham he yaa nahin
 Although doctors have the therapeutic skills to reduce pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding, and other common problems in cancer patients, this group of patients responds to the needs of symptom control in a multi-disciplinary manner of palliative care
 Specialty has evolved
 dard kii dawaaye, jaise ki morphine or oxicodon or michali or ulti ko rokane ke liye antiemetics dawaaen, cancer se sambandhit lakshanon se yukt rogiyon main aam taur par kaam main lee jaati hai
 Sophisticated antiemetics such as ondansetron and analogues, as well as aprapitant, have made radical treatment more likely in cancer patients
 cancer ke kaaran purana dard hameshaa satat utak kshati ke kaaran hota he jo rog yaa upachaar prakriya se sambandhit he yadhyapi paryaavarniya karkon or dard ke vyavhaar ke utpaadan main prabhavi gadbadi kii bhi bhoomika hoti he, cancer ke dard se yukt rogiyon main aam taur par pramukh ityologic kaaran nahin hote hai
 Furthermore, most patients with severe cancer-related pain are in the late stages of their lives and need palliative therapy
 mudde jaise nashile padaarthon ke upyog kaa saamaajik kalank, kaam or kaaryaatmak sthiti or swasthya dekhbhaal, samgr maamle ke prabandhan main adhik mahatvapurn nahin hai
 Therefore, the specific strategy for cancer pain management is to try to get maximum comfort to the patient by the use of narcotics and other drugs, surgical and physical methods
 doctor cancer ke antim sthiti ke rogiyon main dard ke liye maadak padaarthon kaa upyog nahin karnaa chaahate hai kyon ki isse unhen isaki lat ho sakati he yaa unki shwaas kriya main baadha aa sakati he
 Palliative care is a new branch of the care movement that provides more comprehensive support in the treatment of pain in cancer patients
 thakaan cancer rogiyon ke liye ek bahut hi aam samasya he or haal hi main cancer chikitsa vigyaniyon ke liye iskaa upachaar bahut mahatvapurn ban gaya he, yadhyapi yah kai rogiyon main jivan kii gunvattta ko lekar mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Clinical trials, also called research studies, also test new treatments in cancer patients

 ek naidanik pareekshan, ek lambi or satark cancer anusandhan kii prakriya ke antim charnon main se ek he
 The search for new treatments begins in the laboratory, where scientists first test and develop new ideas
 agar ek drushtikon upyogi prathit hota he to aglaa kadam hota he iskaa jaanavar par pareekshan, jo yah bataata he ki cancer rogi par iskaa kya prabhaav hoga or iske koi hanikaarak prabhaav hai yaa nahin
 Of course, many treatments that work well in the laboratory or in animals do not always prove effective in humans
 upyogi maane jane vaale upachaar surakshit or prabhavi hai yaa nahin, iskaa pataa lagane ke liye cancer ke rogiyon main adhyayan kiye jate hai
 It may be that the patient participating in this treatment will personally get help from this treatment
 ve cancer visheshgyon se aadhuniktam suraksha praapt karte hai or ve yaa to jaanch kiya ja rahaa nayaa ilaaj praapt karte hai yaa cancer ke liye sarvottam uplabdh maanak upachaar praapt karte hai
 Also, new treatments may carry unknown risks, but if new treatments prove effective or more effective than standard treatments, the patient studied becomes the first person to receive its benefit
 is baat kii koi guarantee nahin he ki pareekshan kiya jane vaala nayaa upachaar yaa ek maanak upachaar achche parinaam degaa
 In children with cancer, a survey showed that children who underwent such testing did not, on average, see better or worse outcomes than standard treatments; This ensures that the success or failure of any experimental treatment cannot be predicted
 poorak or vaikalpik chikitsa upachaar, chikitsa, swasthya raksha pranaaliyon, prathaon or utpaadon ke vividh samooh hai, jo parmparik chikitsa ke bhaag nahin hai
