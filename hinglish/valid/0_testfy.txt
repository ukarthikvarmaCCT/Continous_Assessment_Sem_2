 Direct details of Aryabhata's work are known only from Aryabhatiya
 aryabhatiy naam baad ke tippaneekaron dwaara diya gaya he, aryabhat ne swayan ise naam nahin diya hoga; yah ullekh unke shishy bhaskar pratham ne ashmakatantr yaa ashmaaka ke lekhon main kiya he
 It is also sometimes known as arya-shata-ashta - the number of verses in his text
 yah sutara sahitya ke samaan bahut hi sankshipt style main likhaa gaya he, jahaan prayek pankti ek jatil pranali ko yaad karne ke liye sahaayta karti he
 Thus, the interpretation of meaning is due to commentators
 samooche granth main 108 chand he, saath hi parichayatmak 13 atirikt hai, is puure ko chaar padon athwa adhyyon main vibhajit kiya gaya he : Additionally, some versions also add some florists to compliment the creations at the end
 aryabhatiy ne ganit or khagol vigyaan main padya rup main, kuch naveentaayen prastut kii, jo anek sadiyon tak prabhaavshaalee rahi
 The climax of the book's brevity is described in his reviews by his disciple Bhaskara i and by Neelkanth Somayaji in his Aryabhatiya commentary
 bharatke itihaas main jise 'guptkaal' yaa 'swarnyug' ke naam se janaa jaataa he, us samay bharat ne sahitya, kala or vigyaan kshetron main abhootpurv pragati kii
 At that time, Nalanda University in Magadha was a major and renowned center of knowledge

 Aryabhata has had a great influence on the astrological theory of India and the world
 bharat main sabase adhik prabhaav kerala pradesh kii jyotish parampara par rahaa
 Aryabhata holds the most important position among Indian mathematicians
 inhone 120 aryaalandon main jyotish shaastra ke siddhant or usase sambandhit ganit ko sutararup main apane aryabhatiy granth main likhaa he
 He on the one hand represented the value of pi more accurate and sure than the preceding Archimedes in mathematics, while on the other hand it was declared for the first time in astronomy with the example that the Earth itself rotates on its axis
 aryabhat ne jyotishshastra ke aajkal ke unnat sadhano ke bina jo khoj kii thi,yah unki mahatta he
 Aryabhata had discovered the discovery of Copernicus a thousand years ago
 "golpad" main aryabhat ne likhaa he "naav main baitha hua manushya jab pravaah ke saath aage badhata he, tab vah samajhataa he ki achar vriksh, pashaan, parvat aadi padaarth ulti gati se ja rahe hai
 In the same way, stable constellations also appear to be moving in reverse from the moving earth
 " is prakaar aryabhat ne sarvapratham yah siddh kiya ki prithvi apane aksh par gumti he
 He considered Satyuga, Treta, Dwapara and Kali Yuga as equal
 inke anusaar ek kalp main 14 manwantar or ek manwantar main 72 mahayug tathaa ek chaturyug main satyuga, dwapar, treta or kaliyug ko samaan mana he
 According to Aryabhata the relation of circumference and diameter of a circle comes to 62,832: 20,000 which is pure to four decimal places
 aryabhat ne badi-badi sankhyaon ko aksharon ke samooh se nirupit karne kityant vaigyanik vidhi kaa prayog kiya he
 The place-value numeral system, first seen in the Bakshali manuscript of the third century, was clearly present in his works
 unhone nishchit rup se pratik kaa upyog nahin kiya, parantu francisi ganitagya george iffrah ke matanusaar- rikt gunank ke saath, das kii ghaat ke liye ek sthaan dharak ke rup main shunya kaa gyaan aryabhat ke sthaan-mulya ank pranali main nihit tha
 However, Aryabhata did not use Brahmi numerals; Continuing the Sanskrit tradition dating back to the Vedic period, he used letters of the alphabet to denote numbers, expressing quantities as mnemonic
 aryabhat ne pai ke sanniktan par kaary kiya or sambhawatah unhen is baat kaa gyaan ho gaya tha ki pai irreshnal he
 In the second part of Aryabhatiyam, he writes: iske anusaar vyas or paridhi kaa anupaat × 8 + 62000) / 2 xxrep 4 0 = 3
1416 he, jo paanch mahatvapurn aankadon tak bilkul sateek he
 Aryabhata, interpreting the word imminent, coming immediately before the preceding word, states that it is not only an approximation, but that the value is incomparable
 yadi yah sahi he, to yah ek atyant parishkrut drushtikon he, kyonki europe main paai kii tarkheenata kaa siddhant lambert dwaara keval 1761 main hi siddh ho paaya tha
 This approximation was mentioned in Muhammad ibn Musa al-khwarizmi's book on algebra after Aryabhatiya's translation into Arabic
 ganitpad 6 main, aryabhat ne trikon ke kshetrafal ko is prakaar bataaya he- This translates to: The area of a triangle is equal to the result of half of the side with a perpendicular
 aryabhat ne apane kaam main dwijya ke vishay main charchaa kii he or usko naam diya he ardh-jya iskaa shabdic arth he "ardh-tantri"
 People started calling it sine because of the ease
 jab arabi lekhakon dwaara unke kaam kaa sanskrit se arabi main anuwaad kiya gaya, to unhone isko jiba kaha 
 Since, in Arabic writing, vowels are used less frequently, hence its more abbreviated name
 jab baad ke lekhakon ko ye samaj main aayaa ki jb jiba kaa hi sankshipt rup he, to unhone vaapis jiba kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar diya
 Jiba means "koh" or "trench"
 baad main barahavin sadi main, jab krimona ke gheraardo ne in lekhanon kaa arabi se latin bhashaa main anuwaad kiya, tab unhone arabi jiba kii jagah uske latin samakaksh sinus ko daal diya, jiskaa shabdic arth "khoh" yaa khai" hi he
 And after that in English, the sinus itself became the sign

 Here gives an example from Bhaskara's interpretation on Aryabhatiya: arthath, bataaen n = 8x+ 5 = 9y +4 = 7z +1
 isse n ke liye sabase chota maan 85 nikalataa he
 In general, the diophantine equations were notorious for rigidity
 is tarah ke samikarnon kii vyapak rup se charchaa pracheen vaidic granth sulb sutara main he, jiske adhik pracheen bhaag 800 i

 Aryabhata's method has been called the Kuttaka method for solving such problems
 kuṭṭaka kuttak kaa arth he peesna, arthath chote chote tukdon main todna or is vidhi main choti sankhyaon ke rup main mul khandon ko likhane ke liye ek punaravarti kalanvidhi kaa samavesh tha
 Today this algorithm, according to Bhaskar's interpretation in 621 AD, is the standard method for solving first-order diophantine equations, and is often referred to as the Aryabhata algorithm
 diophentine samikarnon kaa istemaal kryptolujee main hota he or aresae sammelan, 2006 ne apana dhyaan kuttak vidhi or sulvasutra ke purv ke kaaryon par kendrit kiya
 In Aryabhatiya, Aryabhata has provided interesting results for the classes and ranges of cubes
 or Aryabhata's astronomy system was called the Auric system, his later writings on astronomy, which propose a second model, superficially, have been lost, but they can be partially reconstructed from the discussions in Brahmagupta's Khandakhadyaka
 is
 kuch granthon main ve prithvi ke ghurnan ko akaash kii abhaasi gati kaa kaaran bataate hai
 Aryabhata seemed to believe that the earth revolves around its axis
 yah srilanka ko sandarbhit ek kathan se gyaat hota he, jo taron kii gati kaa prithvi ke ghurnan se utpann aapekshik gati ke rup main varnan karata he
 The next stanza describes the motion of stars and planets as actual motion: lanka yahan bumadhya rekha par ek sandarbh bindu he, jise khagoleey gananaa ke liye madhyahn rekha ke sandarbh main samaan maan ke rup main le liya gaya tha
 Aryabhata has described a seismic model of the solar system, in which the sun and the moon move through the home cycle, orbiting the Earth
 is model main, jo paaya jaataa he pitamahasiddhanth, prayek grahon kii gati do grahchakron dwaara niyantrit he, ek chota mand grahchakr or ek bada sheeghra grahchakr
 The order of the planets according to the distance from Earth is as follows: Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Constellation grahon kii sthiti or avadhi kii gananaa samaan rup se gati karte hue binduon se saapeksh ke rup main kii gayi thi, jo budh or shukr ke maamle main, jo prithvi ke chaaron ore ausat surya ke samaan gati se ghoomte hai or mangal, brihaspati or shani ke maamle main, jo raashichakr main prithvi ke chaaron ore apni vishisht gati se gati karte hai
 According to most historians of astronomy, this two-planetary model reflects elements of Greek astronomy prior to Ptolemy
 aryabhat ke model ke ek anya tatv sighroka, surya ke sambandh main buniyadi grahon kii avadhi, ko kuch itihaaskaaron dwaara ek antarnihit surya kendrit model ke chinh ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 He said that the moon and planets shine with the reflected light of the sun
 maujuuda brahmandavigyaan se alag, jisame grahanon kaa kaarak chhadam grah nispand bindu raahu or ketu the, unhone grahanon ko prithvi dwaara daali jane vaali or is par girane vaali chaaya se sambaddh bataaya
 Thus lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon enters the Earth's shadow and discusses in detail the size and extent of this Earth's shadow and then the size of the eclipse part during the eclipse and its calculation
 baad ke bhartiya khagolavidon ne in gananaaon main sudhaar kiya, lekin aryabhat kii vidhiyon ne pramukh saar pradaan kiya tha
 The calculation was so accurate that the 18th-century scientist Guillaume le Gentil, during his visit to Pondicherry, found that the period of lunar eclipse of 1765-08-30 by Indians was calculated to be 41 seconds shorter, while its charts were 68 seconds

 This approximation was a significant improvement over the computation of the Greek mathematician, Eratosthenes, 200 AD), whose calculations are not known in modern units, but his estimate had an error of about 5–10%

 Similarly, according to them, the duration of the year of the Earth is 365 days 6 hours 12 minutes 30 seconds, according to the calculation of modern time there is an error of 3 minutes 20 seconds

 Aryabhata claimed that the Earth rotates on its own axis and that some elements of their planetary planetary models rotate at the same speed with which the planets revolve around the Sun
 is prakaar aisa suzav diya jaataa he ki aryabhat kii sangannaayen anternihit surya kendrit model par aadhaarit thim, jisame grah surya kaa chakkar lagaate hai

 haalaanki kuch log yah sweekaar karte hai ki aryabhat kii pranali purv ke ek surya kendrit model se upji thi jiskaa gyaan unako nahin tha
 It has also been claimed that they considered the planets to be elliptical, although no primary evidence has been presented for this

 Aryabhata's work had a major influence in the Indian astronomical tradition and through translation he influenced many neighboring cultures
 islamic swarna yug, ke dauraan iskaa arabi anuwaad vishesh prabhaavshaalee tha
 Some of his results are cited by al-khwarizmi and referenced by 10th-century Arabic scholar al-biruni, who wrote in his description that Aryabhata's followers believed that the earth rotated on its axis
 sin, kosine ke saath hi, varsin kii unki paribhaasha,or vilom sin, ne trikonmiti kii utpatti ko prabhavit kiya
 He was also the first person to construct sine and versatile tables, from 0 ° to 90 ° at 3
75 ° intervals, to a precision of 4 decimal places
 vastav main "sin " or "kosine " ke aadhunik naam aryabhat dwaara prachlit jya or kojya shabdon ke galat uccharan hai
 He was pronounced in Arabic as Jiba and Kojiba
 phir ek arabi jyamiti paath ke latin main anuwaad ke dauraan cremona ke jerard dwaara inaki galat vyakhya kii gayi; unhone jiba ke liye arabi shabd 'jeb' liya jiskaa arth he "poshaak main ek tah", el sinus 
 Aryabhata's methods of astronomical calculation were also very influential
 trikonmitik talikaon ke saath, ve islamic duniya main vyapak rup se istemaal kii jaati thi
 And many Arabic astronomical tables were used to calculate
 vishesh rup se, arabi spain vaigyanik al-jharkaali ke kaaryon main pai jane vaali khagoleey talikaon kaa latin main tolado kii talikaon ke rup main anuwaad kiya gaya or ye europe main sadiyon tak sarvaadhik sookshm panchang ke rup main istemaal main rahi
 The date calculations done by Aryabhata and his followers have been in continuous use in India for practical purposes of determining the Panchang or Hindu calendar, which was also transmitted to the Islamic world, where they formed the basis of the Jalali calendar, which Omar Khayyam in 1073 Including some astronomers, the version of which is presented as a national calendar in Iran and Afghanistan today
 Are in use jalaalee tithipatr apni tithiyon kaa aankalan vaastavik saura pargaman ke aadhaar par karata he, jaisaa aryabhat 
is prakaar ke tithi patr main tithiyon kii gananaa ke liye ek panchang kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Although dates were difficult to calculate, the Jalali calendar had fewer seasonal errors than the Gregorian calendar

 If, a1, a2, a3 are respectively more pure square root, it can be done in three steps as follows- arthath Let be the square root of 889
 ham pehle a1 = 29, b = 48 lete hai to, The square root of 889 is approximately 29,8160303
 atah uparokt parinaam dashamalav ke 4 ankon tak shuddh he
 Now we can see that by taking a1 = 30, b = -11, a more accurate result is given
 yah parinaam dashamalav ke 6 ankon tak shuddh he

 UPS has one means of energy storage, such as a battery, a fast-moving flywheel, a charged capacitor or an excessive current flowing in a superconducting coil
 upies, sahaayak urja-strot jaise- stand-bai janarator aadi se is maamle main bhinn hai ki vidyut jane par ve sambandhit upkaran ko milane vaali vidyut main naganya samay ke liye vyavdhaan karte hai jisase us upkaran ke kaam main baadha yaa rukawat nahin aati
 UPS is often used with computers, data centers, communication devices, etc
 where an accident can occur due to power outages; Fear of destroying important figures; There may be loss of business etc

 All the saints of India are Mahatmas, they are helping them in some form or the other
 bihar main satsang kaa kaary ab din prati-din badhata hi gaya
 In 35 years Babu Rajeshwari Prasad Singh ji, who was a good vassal, passed through Bihar after reading this "instrument"
 aap gaya praant ke antargat pandui ke rahane vaale the
 Etah came and saw Maharaj Ji, learned the function of Bhajan
 inkaa hriday bada shuddh tha, sanskari-purush the or teen hi varsh main purna-gyaan praapt kar liya
 Then he preached in Bihar with the permission of Shri Gurudev
 aaj sara bihar is aatm-vidya se ot-prot ho rahaa he
 Gurudev had such a blessing that today this satsang spread all over Bihar and Bengal on a good scale and hundreds of women are taking advantage of spirituality today
 uttar pradesh main pahile se hi praayah sabhi shaharon main kendra khul gayi the
 Babu Sadonarayan ji, an advocate from Jaipur, the lawyer was returning from Allahabad, he was studying some "medium" in the railways and you also took and read from him

 As soon as i read, i got sick, thought - i should see such a saint and make the desert land like Rajasthan green with this Ganga
 ghar aae, patr likhaa or jaipur padhaarney kii prarthana kii
 In response, you wrote - i am not a monk, i am a planetary, you first come to us and then i will be able to come here
 bas phir kya tha vah eta pahunche or kuch samay uparant aap bhi jaipur padhaare
 In this way, the lawyer made an attempt to bring Ganga in the form of joy, by becoming Bhagiratha, so that today entire Rajasthan is enjoying this knowledge Ganga
 iske baad har saal aap jaipur aane lage, bhandara prarambh hua
 Hundreds of big and small people started taking advantage of satsang in Rajasthan
 bhandare main bhi saare bharatvarsh se sahasron kii sankhya main log aane lage
 Instead of Basant Panchami, the second year's bhandara was made on the big day holiday, which continued in Ate till 1950
 jab satsang adhik badha- dur-dur ke jigyaasu eta aane lage to to eta main rail ke na hone se aane jane vaale satsangiyon ko kathinaayee hoti thi
 There were private salaries, at that time there were no government buses either
 logon ko anek ksht hone lage, raaton-raat padaa rahanaa padataa tha
 Many times it happened that due to not getting a ride from many Satsangi Shikohabad of Bihar reached Etah with its bed head on it, your heart melted and it was intended that you should move from here to where people can come and stay, etc
 Be arranged aapane pratham jaipur kaa iraadaa kiya lekin idhar ke jigyaasuon ne prarthana kii-“maharaj jaipur dur he ham garib aadmi kaise aapke darshan ko pahunch sakenge
 "so you started thinking again and Mathura's place in thought seemed appropriate
 bas mathura kaa aana nishchay ho gaya or san 1951 ke oktober maas main aap mathura aa gaye
 There was more talk here and within four or five years countless lovers started coming to Mathura
 jigyaasuon ko aisa prathit hone laga ki bhagwaan krishna phir apane janm sthaan main gita kaa sundar upadesh dene ke liye padhaare hai
 The bhandara here was removed from the big day and kept on Shivaratri
 yah bhandara to kendra kaa hota hi tha ab kai jagah bhandare hone lage; prachaar kaa kaam vaayu ke praval veg kii bhanti badhane laga yahan tak ki san 1956 main kalkatte kaa bulaava aayaa or haavda bhandara karke aath din paramhans dev ji ke ashram dakshineshwar tehre
 There he also said that i have got great peace here, Paramhans ji has also been seen and one day he should have remained in the tomb for about ten hours
 us samay jitne premi saath the sab kii ajeeb dasha thi ek adbhut khinchaav tha jo varnan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He was the embodiment of stamina and seriousness, always laughing and remaining calm
 unke andar kaa bhed koi puraa nahin jaan paaya
 He was a repository of learning
 kisi ne jo kuch poocha vahi saralata se samajhakar batalaaya
 All his work was to remove the pride of the practitioner, and whenever he saw that pride came, immediately warned him
 jahaan dekha ki koi galati kisi se hui kabhi hans kar, kabhi daantkar use bataa dete
 He used to recognize pride immediately
 vah kehete bhi the ki guru kaa kaary or kuch nahin he keval shishy ko abhimaan se bachaaye rakhana he
 You used to say pride to others, sometimes to others
 aap kehete the -”hameshaa shishy ko chahie ki vah guru ko saath lekar bole, kabhi apane guru ko mat bhuulo
 It is the Guru who gives his knowledge to others through you
 yadi tumko is par apana abhimaan he to vah galat he
 It will not affect others
 satsang to koi or hi karaata he
 Till today i have never considered forgetting that i conduct satsang
 “
 Your knowledge was immense, when you explained a complex subject, you could explain it so easily that despite being serious, it was understandable
 kisi bhi vishay par ghanton bol sakate the
 Sometimes a doubt arose, without stopping to say
 praayah sabhi ko jab kuch poochna hua magar puch na sake to swany hi aisi baaten ched dete ki vah baat bhi hal ho jaati
 
 jisane ek dfa bhi sohabat uthaai hameshaa ke liye aapkaa mautqid ho gaya 
 In spite of having power, we saw in Doctor Chaturbhuj Sahay Ji, the symptom of not using power, according to the great Mahatmas
 unki upasthiti main main ek vicitra shanti kaa anubhav karata tha or meri shankaaen keval unke samukh baithne maatr se tatkaal dur ho jaati thim
 He always liked to be surrounded by lovers, even if he could not get sick due to rest
 |unke hriday main apane paraaye kaa bhav hi utpann na hota tha
 He was the great icon of the high household religion
 arthabhaav kii chintaa unhe chhu tak naa gai thi - maine unhe kabhi chintit dekha hi nahin

 i once heard your discourse on the samadhis in Prayag, in which you have understood all the samadhis of the Panch Kosh very well elsewhere
 lekin kuch samay baad phir bhul gaya
 Once he was in a very happy mood, you said- “pandit ji considers samadhi very difficult
 unamem koi aisi baat nahin he
 She comes daily in our satsang
 aao aaj tumhen samaadhiyon ke bhed samajhaayen
 "I felt very happy that my prayer was accepted
 phir bole- “kaagaj pencil lekar likh lo jisase phir bhul na jaao
 “we wrote it
 annamay kosh kii samadhi se lekar aanandamay kosh kii sahaj samadhi tak jise gita main dharm megh samadhi batalaaya gaya he bade sundar dhang se samajhaayin or savikalp tathaa savichaar bade achche dhang se batalaaya
 This description has also come in yoga-shastra and sometimes in the Upanishads, but without explaining to an experienced guru, i do not understand it properly
 vah to uske saath-saath anubhav bhi karaate jate the
 Many times you would tell that you are in this stage at this time
 | His knowledge was immense
 sab jaanate huye bhi kabhi kisi se kuch kehete nahin the
 Was afraid to sit in front, what would you say if bad feelings of your mind would come in front of them
 parantu itani gambheertha tha ki abhi yah nahin kaha ki tum main yah dosha he
 Those who come to eat and come, the educated moralists also come, but never say anything about someone's character
 bas yahi kehete ki bhagwaan kaa dhyaan karo or hamaare bataae hue saadhan ko isi tarah karo jaise bataaya jaay, yah saare dosha to swatah hi dur ho jaaenge
 What is the magic that does not speak on the head? is prakaar ke anek saadhan jo jiske liye uchit hota bataake saadhan main laga dete the
 That is why we as a person of religion used to understand them as our own, their cultivation was not for any community, it was for human society
 kyonki jab sab manushya ek hi hai to unke dharm bhi do nahin ho sakate
 That is why all the sects like hindu-muslim-sikh-jain etc
 adopted their education
 is andhere yug main vah padhe-likhe log jo ishwar ko maanate hi nahin the, dharm ke naam kii khilli udaate the, sadmarg main lag gaye or ek naveen prakaash paa kritakruty ho gayi

 Mother Jiya's spiritual practice began under the patronage of the able Guru Mahatma Ramchandra Ji Maharaj and that great man very soon made him complete and gave him the title of Acharya

 You used to say that meet someone who has seen God, only he can make you see God
 aapaki sadhana mukhyatah karm ,upasna or gyaan kii miloni he
 By adopting this, the inquisitive gets reputed in a short time, which is the real experimental form of Gita
 isi liye yah drushtaa saadhan bhi kehalaata he
 Any worshiper of any faith can do this sadhana and there is no bond of any religion, caste and country
 aaj lakhon sankhya main jigyaasu bhai - bahan isko apanaakar aadhyatmik laabh le rahen he
 We could not understand in the shadow of such a saint whether darkness could ever come again? Can this joy sometimes be different from us and may such a great man also be estranged? But the time has come to make us fully aware of their light
 kyonki surya ke na rahane par hi prakaash kaa bodh hota he
 We could not recognize him in the glare of his light
