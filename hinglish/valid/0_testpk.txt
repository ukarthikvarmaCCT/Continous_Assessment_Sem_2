 After several unsuccessful attempts to capture Dawn, the police finally succeed, and DCP d'silva is almost caught by Dawn, that Dawn dies, and d'silva's attempt to reach Dawn's boss
 The dream remains incomplete
 iske baad di'silva don ko vahiin dafna detaa he
 Vijay, who lives in a Mumbai slum, is a simple man who dances in Mumbai and is trying to raise his two children
 disipi di'silva kii mulaakaat ek baar vijay se hoti he, jisase unhen pataa chalata he, kii vijay don kaa hamshakl he, or vah vijay se don banane ko kehete hai, taaki vijay police kii mukhabiri kare, or uske raste di'silva is aapraadhik network kii tah tak pahunch paaen
 Vijay accepts them, and becomes a don and goes back to his gang, where he pretends to have lost his memory

 Jasjeet was arrested by DCP d'silva; The reason jj's wife died, and her two children went missing

 Vijay takes a 'red diary' of Don, and goes to meet DCP d'silva
 roma bhi uske saath jaati he, or vahaan use akelaa paakar vah us par hamalaa kar detii he
 d'silva arrives at the moment and tells Roma the reality of Vijay, and after this Roma also joins Vijay
 vijay vah diary di'silva ko de detaa he, or use padhakar unhen pataa chalata he ki don ke bos kaa naam varadhan he, parantu uske bare main isse adhik jaankaree us diary main nahin likhi hoti
 Slowly, Vijay learns more about Don, and one day with Roma's help, he announces that his memory has returned
 isi kushi main ek party hoti he, jisamen police kii red pad jaati he
 In this raid, DCP d'silva is badly injured in the shootout, and the police apprehend Vijay as a don
 vijay un logon ko sach bataata he, jiske baad police vaale use disipi di'silva ke paas hospital le jate he; kintu kuch bol paane se pehle hi disipi di'silva kii mrityu ho jaati he
 Vijay is being sent to a high-security prison by a truck, and he manages to escape from the truck

 Vijay gets badly involved in this development, as the police refuse to believe that he is Vijay, and at the same time, Don's underworld gang realizes that he is not really Don
 upar se vah laal diary, jo usne disipi di'silva ko di thi, use jasjit chura le jaataa he
 Vijay succeeds in dodging both the police and Narang, the current ringleader of the underworld gang, with the help of Roma, and attempts to return to his old life
 vijay interpol ke afasar, aar ke maalik se milane kaa aagrah karata he, or unase kuch samay kii maang karata he, taaki vah apni begunaahi kaa pramaan laa sake
 He then discovers that what he perceived to be the boss of the Interpol officer r until now, is actually the boon, who kidnaps the real R's boss and is disguised by them

 Vijay tries to tell this to other police officers, but they do not believe his words
 iske baad vijay varadhan ke sabhi gundon se swayan ladata he, or isi bich roma bhi vah laal diary dhundhakar le aati he
 In the same battle, a goon snatches the diary from Roma and burns it
 police un logon ko chaaron taraf se gher leti he, or us samay vijay apni jeb se laal dieriy nikaalkar unhen bataata he, kii jo diary jalaai gai, vah vastav main nakli thi
 Don gives the diary to the police, declaring him innocent and removing all charges on him

 Beta cells of Langerhans' islets in type 1 diabetes are destroyed by an automated resistance process, so researchers and clinicians are actively looking for ways to restore physiologic beta cell activity through islet transplantation

 Some gladiators were volunteers who risked their legal and social status and their lives by appearing in the arena
 inamen se adhikansh ko das ke rup main tiraskrit kiya jaataa tha, inhen kathor paristhitiyon main paala jaataa tha, saamaajik rup se haashie par rakhaa jaataa tha or maut ke baad bhi pruthakkrut kiya jaataa tha
 Regardless of their origins, the Gladiators presented to the audience an example of Rome's military ethics and could elicit respect and popular acclaim, either in battle or dying well
 unki prashansa ucch or nimna kala main hoti thi or manoranjankarta ke rup main unke mulya ko sampoorn roman samrajya main bahumoolya or saamaanya vastuon main abhivyakt kiya jaataa tha
 The origins of gladiatorial battles are debatable

 Its popularity prompted its use in more lavish and expensive landscapes or "gladiator games"

 The type of gladiator used was Thracian, but the development of Munus and its gladiator type was influenced by Samnium's vigorous support for Hannibal and subsequent punitive expeditions by Rome and his Companion allies; The earliest and most mentioned type was Samnite
 iske turant baad, samnium main yuddh ko samaan khatre or samaan rup se shandaar samaapan ke saath ladaa gaya
 The enemy, in addition to his other war preparations, devised his war policy to shine with new and luxurious weapons for the fight

 jaisaa ki seenet dwaara nirnit tha, taanashaah jeet kaa ek jashn manaata he, jisamen kabja kiye gaye kavach dwaara behtareen kaarykram manaaya jaataa tha
 Therefore the Romans used the splendid armor of their enemies to honor their gods; While the Kampanian reacted to his pride and his disgust for the Samnite, the genre equipped gladiators who entertained him during their feasts and named him Samnite

 Munus became a morally instructive form of historical legislation in which the honorable option before the gladiator was either to fight well or to die well

 The context of the Punic War and the disastrous defeat of Rome in Canaan links these early games to the charity, celebration of military victories and religious avoidance of military tragedy; In the era of military threat and empire expansion, this munera seems to act as an agenda to boost morale

 Politically an ambitious privateer could postpone his dead father's munus during the election season, when a liberal show hoped to garner votes; Those in power and those who wanted to reach needed the support of the general public and their tribune and their vote could be achieved through an exceptionally spectacular program - sometimes just by its promise
