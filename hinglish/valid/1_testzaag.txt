 In China, the practice of acupuncture can be traced back to the Stone Age in the past, with Bian Xi or pointed stones
 a bian stone was found in 1963 in Duolan County, Mongolia, tracing the origins of acupuncture to the Neolithic

 The Mwangdui text, dating back to the 2nd century BCE, although this text dates back to Shijie and Huangdi Nezing, mentions the pointed stones from which boils and moxibustion were opened but not acupuncture, but by the second century BCE, acupuncture Substituted moxibustion as the primary treatment for systemic conditions

 In 1757 physician Su Dakun described a further decline in acupuncture and said that it is an extinct art, with few experts left; Its decline was partly attributed to the popularity of drugs and prescriptions, as well as its association with the lower class
 1822 main, china ke samraat ke ek farmaan ne imperial academy of medicine main acupankchar ke shikshan or abhyaas ko tatkaal prabhaav se pratibandhit kar diya, kyonki yah sajjan-vidwaanon ke liye abhyaas ke anukool nahin thi

 In TCM, the body is understood as a whole that is made up of a "system of actions" called Zhang-fu
 in paddatiyon ko vishisht angon ke naam par rakhaa gaya he, haalanki ye pranaliyaan or ang aapas main sidhe nahin jude hai
 The Zhang system is associated with solid yin organs, such as the visceral liver organs associated with yang are hollow
 swasthya ko yin or yang ke bich santulan kii sthiti ke rup main samajha jaataa he or inamen se kisi ke bhi asantulit, avarodhit yaa sthir hone se beemaari hoti he
 The yang force is immaterial qi, a concept roughly translated as "vital energy", the yin equivalent is associated with blood but blood is not the same with the body

 Classical texts also describe most of the main acupuncture points present on the twelve main and eight additional meridians as also cited) for a total of fourteen "channels" through which qi and blood flow
 anya bindu jo chaudaa channelon par nahin hai un par bhi sui lagaai jaati he
 Local pain is treated by applying an "ashi" needle where qi or blood is believed to be stagnant
 baarah mukhya channel jhang-phu hai fefde, badi aant, pet, pleeha, heart, choti aanton, mutrashay, gurde, peri cardium, pittashay, yakrut or amoort
 Eight other avenues, which are collectively referred to as Qui Jing Ba Mai, include Luo Vessels, divers, Sinu Channel, Ren Mai and Do Mai, and the needle is also pierced in the back of the torso
 shesh chah quee jing ba maai ko mukhya baarah shirobindu par kushalta se sui chubhai jaati he
 Generally qi is described as one that flows through each channel in a continuous circuit
 iske alaava, prayek channel kaa ek vishisht pahalu he or "chini ghadi" ke do ghante letaa he
 Zhang-fu is divided into yin and yang, with three of each type located on each limb
 Qi mana jaataa he ki sharir ke madhyam se circuit main chalata he, jo gahare or uthle, donon yatra karata he
 The external pathways correspond to the acupuncture point shown on the acupuncture chart, while the deeper paths correspond to where a channel enters the physiological cavity corresponding to each organ
 haath ke teen yin channel seene par shuru hote hai or haath ke bhitari sataha se hote hue puure haath par jate hai
 The three yang channels of the hand start from the hand and go through the outer surface of the hand to the head
 paanv ke teen yin channel pair se shuru hokar pair ke andruni sataha se hote hue seene tak jate hai
 The three yang channels of the foot begin on the face in the area of the eye, travel under the body and pass through the outer surface of the foot to the foot
 prayek channel yin or yang pahalu se bhi judaa he, yaa to "purna" "kam", "adhik", yaa "chamak" 
 a standard teaching lesson, comments on the nature and relationship of meridians and Zhang Fu organs: channelon kaa siddhant angon ke siddhant ke saath antarsambandh he
 Traditionally, internal organs have never been considered as independent structural existence
 balki, dhyaan, channel network or ang ke bich kaaryaatmak or manovikari antarsambandhon par kendrit rahaa
 yah pahchaan itani kareebi he ki baarah paaramparik praathmik channelon main se prayek, ek yaa anya mahatvapurn ang kaa naam rakhata he
 In the clinic, the entire framework of diagnosis, medical science and point selection, is based on the theoretical framework of channels
 "yah baarah praathmik channelon kii vajah se he, ki log jite hai, beemaari kaa gathan hota he, logon kaa ilaaj hota he or beemaari ubhartee he
 "
 From the beginning, however, we can see that, like other aspects of traditional medicine, channel theory reflects limitations on the level of scientific development at the time of its formation and is therefore contaminated with philosophical idealism and metaphysics of the time
 is
 jis chiz kaa satat naidanik mulya hota he uskaa, anusandhan or abhyaas ke madhyam se punarpareekshan hote rahanaa zaruri he taaki uski vaastavik prakruti kaa nirdhaaran ho sake
 The meridians are part of the controversy in attempts to reconcile acupuncture with traditional medicine
 rashtriya swasthya santhaan ke 1997 ke acupankchar sahmati nirmaan bayaan main kaha gaya ki acupankchar bindu, Qi, shirobindu pranali or sambandhit siddhant, acupankchar ke upyog main ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaate hai, lekin sharir kii samakaleen samaj ke saath judane main mushkil paidaa karte hai
 Chinese medicine forbids dissection and how the body functions as a result is related to the world around the body and not to the internal structure of the body
 sharir ke 365 "vibhaajan", varsh main dinon kii sankhya par aadhaarit the or TCM pranali main prastaavit baarah shirobindu ko un baarah pramukh nadiyon par aadhaarit mana jaataa he jo china main bahati hai
 However, these ancient traditions of Qi and meridians have no counterpart in chemistry, physics, and biology, and to date scientists have found no evidence that supports their existence
 2008 ke vidyut pratibaadha adhyayan ne nishkarsh nikaala he ki haalanki parinaam vicharottejak the, uplabdh adhyayan mahatvapurn seemaabaddh tha or kharaab gunvattta vaala tha or is vajah se shirobindu yaa acupankchar binduon ke astitv ko pradarshit karne kaa koi spasht sakshya nahin tha
 The acupuncture specialist interrogates the patient and decides which points to treat so that he can make a diagnosis according to the tradition he uses
 TCM main, nidaan ke chaar tareeke hai: nirikshan, shravan or gandh, jaanch or parisparshan
 Other forms of acupuncture include additional diagnostic techniques
 chini shastreey acupankchar ke kai roopon main, saath hi saath japani acupankchar main, mansapeshiyon or haara kaa parisparshan, nidaan ke liye kendriya he
 Although TCM is based on the treatment of "method of incivility" rather than biomedical diagnosis, practitioners familiar with the two systems have commented on the relationship between the two
 ek asamyata ke TCM paddati, jaev chikitsa ke nidaan main ek nishchit seemaa tak parilakshith ho sakati he: is prakaar, pleeha Qi kii kami kaa taatpary puraani thakaan, dast yaa garbhashay ke aage badhane se ho saktaa he
 Similarly, the TCM method may differ from that of the population of patients with a given biomedical diagnosis
 ye nishkarsh TCM kii kahawat "ek rog, kai paddati, ek paddati, kai rog" main samahit hai
 Classically, in clinical practice, acupuncture treatment is generally quite personal and based on philosophical assumptions as well as subjective and intuitive, and not controlled scientific research

 His legacy is that there is now a college in London and a system of needling called "medical acupuncture"
 aaj yah college keval doctoron or pashchimi peshewar chikitsakon ko prashikshan detaa he
 Acupuncture therapy has generated considerable controversy among traditional practitioners; The British Acupuncture Council wishes it should be called "needle treatment" and removed the term 'acupuncture' as it is completely different from traditional methods, but they had to back down after pressure from the medical profession
 maan ne prastaavit kiya ki acupankchar bindu, tantrika chor se sambandhit he or unhone binduon ko nae sire se vibhinn upyog nirdhaarit kiya
 He changed the theory so much that today treatment is not individual to every client, which was a central basis of traditional theory
 paramparaagat rup se ek graahak kii umr, dard kaa prakaar or unke swasthya itihaas ke anusaar sui kaa sangyojan badalata he
 Medical acupuncture does not follow any of these and the presenting symptom is treated using a set of defined points

 Ulett, MD, phd, Professor of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, University of Missouri, said: ted je kapchuk, da web dait hez no vivar ke lekhak ne acupankchar ko "vigyaan-purv" ke rup main sanderbhit kiya he
 Kappuchuk says about TCM theory: acupankchar par 1997 ke NIH sarvasammati bayaan ke anusaar: At least one study found that acupuncture "does not seem to reduce pain in non-prescribed parts of the body more than equal to the pain of needling," and concluded that acupuncture may have the effect of hibernating effects Ho

 The top end of these needles is covered with a thick wire, or wrapped in plastic, which solidifies the needle and provides the acupuncturist with a good grip while piercing the needle
 prayog kii gai sui kaa aakaar or prakaar or use chubhaane kii gaharaai, paalan kii ja rahi acupankchar style par nirbhar karata he
 Heating the acupuncture point, usually by moxibustion, itself is a different treatment than acupuncture and is often, but not exclusively, used as a complementary treatment
 chini shabd jhen jiu, saamanytah acupankchar kaa ullekh karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he, jine se aayaa he jiskaa arth he "sui" or jiu kaa arth he "moksi baston"
 Moxibustion is used in various quantities in current schools of Oriental medicine

 The moxa will then ignite for several minutes and conduct heat in the tissues surrounding the needle, pinched in the patient's body

 Moxa is also sometimes burned on the surface of the skin, usually by applying an ointment to the skin that prevents it from burning, although skin burn is a common practice in China

 These points have been described by acupuncture theory as "targeting the face and head" and are considered to be the most important points in the treatment of disorders affecting the face and head
 rogi let jaataa he or prayek haath par binduon ko pehle sharaab dwaara keetanu-mukt kiya jaataa he or phir patali, dispojable sui ko lagbhag 3-5 mimi kii gaharaai tak daalaa jaataa he jab tak ki marij ko ek "tis" na mahasoos ho, aksar anguuthe or haath ke bich ke kshetra sansani kaa ehsaas hota he
 In the clinical practice of acupuncturists, patients often refer to a certain type of sensation that is associated with this treatment: da american academy of medical acupankchar ne kaha: "sanyukt rajya america main haddi-peshiy dard ke upachaar main acupankchar ko sabase adhik safalataa or sweekruti mili he
 "they say that acupuncture can be considered as a complementary therapy for the conditions below in the list and added:" There are books or at least 1 journal article in support of most indications
 lekin, anusandhan ke nishkarshon ke aadhaar par nishchit nishkarsh durlabh hai kyonki acupankchar main anusandhan kii sthiti acchhee nahin he, lekin sudhar rahi he"
 Several hypotheses have been proposed to explore the physiological mechanisms of acupuncture action
 dard kaa dwaar-niyantran siddhant ne bataaya ki dard avadharana, dard fibre ke sakriy hone kaa pratyaksh parinaam nahin he lekin in dard maarg kii uttejnaa or nirodh ke bich paraspar kriya he
 According to the theory, pain is controlled by inhibitory action on the pain pathway
 yani, dard kii dharna ko kai tareekon se badla ja saktaa he, sharir vigyaan dwaara, manovigyaan dwaara yaa aushadhi vigyaan dwaara
 Door-control theory was developed in brain neuroscience, independent of acupuncture, which was later attributed by the German brain-therapist in 1976 to the perception of acupuncture's analgesic action in brain stem reticular formation
 isse neurohormone antarjaat falit hota he siddhant ke relies ke madhyam se kendriya niyantran kii ridh kii haddi) yaa paridhi rassi par nakaabandi dard yani, kam se kendriya mastishk Some studies suggest that the analgesic action of acupuncture is associated with the release of natural endorphins in the brain
 is aashay ko endorphin kii karrwai ko avaruddh kar samajha ja saktaa he, jiske liye naloxon naamak dawa kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 When naloxone is given to the patient, the analgesic effect of morphine can be reduced, which will make the patient feel a greater level of pain
 jab naloxon ko acupankchar rogi ko diya jaataa he, to acupankchar ke dardanivarak prabhaav ko bhi palata ja saktaa he or rogi dard ke ek ucch str kii jaankaree detaa he
 It should be noted, however, that studies using similar procedures have suggested the role of endogenous opioids in the therapeutic response, including naloxone delivery, and showed that this reaction is not unique to acupuncture
 bandaron par kiye gaye ek adhyayan main jisamen mastishk ke thalamas main sidhe tantrika gatividhi ko darj kiya gaya, yah pataa chalaa ki acupankchar kaa dardanivarak prabhaav ek ghante se adhik tak rahaa
 In addition, there is overlap between the nervous system and acupuncture trigger points in myofascial pain syndrome
 saboot bataate hai ki acupankchar ke saath judy dardanivarak karrwai kii citon main shaamil he fmri kaa upyog karne vaala thailaamas or PET, brain imaging takanic, or pratikriya maarg ke madhyam se pramastishk, sidhe praantastha main neurons ke tantrika aavegon kii electrophysiological recording, jo acupankchar uttejnaa lagu karne par nirodhatmak karrwai dikhaati he
 Similar effects have been observed as a result of the cryptic reaction
 fmri ke upyog vaale ek adhyayan main paaya gaya ki kootabheshaj dardanivarak, thailaamas main nune gatividhi, insula or agrim singulate praantastha se juda tha
 Recently, acupuncture has been shown to increase nitric oxide levels at the treated site, resulting in increased local blood flow

 a major challenge in acupuncture research is the design of an appropriate cryptotic control group
 In testing new drugs, double blinding is the accepted standard, but as acupuncture is a process rather than a pill, it is difficult to design a study in which both the physician and the patient are unaware of the treatment given
 yahi samasya jaev-aushadhi main istemaal hone vaale dabl-blinding prakriya main ubhartee he, jisamen lagbhag sabhi sargical prakriyaayein, danta chikitsa, shaareerik chikitsa, shaamil hai, jaisaa ki institute of medicine kaa kahana he: Controlled trials of surgical procedures have been done less frequently than studies of medications because it is much more difficult to standardize the procedure of surgery
 Surgery depends to some degree on the skills and training of the surgeon and the specific environment and support team available to the surgeon
 a surgical procedure in the hands of a highly skilled, experienced surgeon is different from the same procedure in the hands of an inexperienced and unskilled surgeon 


 For many CAM modalities, it is similarly difficult to separate the effectiveness of the treatment from the effectiveness of the person providing the treatment
:126 acupankchar main chikitsak kii blinding ek chunauti bani hui he
 One proposed solution to blind patients is the development of "pseudo acupuncture", that is, injecting non-acupuncture points or in lieu

 a review in 2007 introduced several confusing acupuncture issues
 Weak physiologic activity of superficial or sham needle penetration is suggested by several lines of research, including rcts showing larger effects of a superficial needle penetrating acupuncture than those of a nonpenetrating sham control, positron emission tomography research indicating that sham acupuncture can stimulate regions of the brain associated with natural opiate production, and animal studies showing that sham needle insertion can have nonspecific analgesic effects through a postulated mechanism of “diffuse noxious inhibitory control”
 Indeed, superficial needle penetration is a common technique in many authentic traditional Japanese acupuncture styles
 a study of 13 analyzes of acupuncture to treat pain, published in the journal BMJ in January 2009, concluded that differences in actual, pseudo, and unaccompanied acupuncture effects were found to be small
 vaigyanikon kii sahmati maujuud he ki sakshya-aadhaarit chikitsa dhaanche kaa istemaal swasthya parinaamon ke moolyankan ke liye kiya janaa chahie or yah ki sakht protocol sahit vyavasthit samikshaayen anivaary he

 The basis development for acupuncture was summarized in 2007 in a review by researcher Edzard Ernst and colleagues

 Emerging clinical evidence seems to indicate that acupuncture is effective for some conditions, but not all

 However, when combined with other traditional therapies, the combination is slightly better than conventional medicine alone
 american pen sosayadi / american college of fiziciouns ke liye samiksha ne spasht pramaan paaya ki acupankchar chirkaalik peeth ke nichle hisse vaale dard ke liye prabhavi he
 Both positive and negative reviews exist about the efficacy of acupuncture when combined with fertilization in an artificial environment

 a 2006 review initially concluded that acupuncture appeared to be more effective than antiemetic drugs, but later because of publication bias in Asian countries, which made their results skewed, the authors retracted their findings; His final conclusion was in line with the Cochrane review that - acupuncture is no better than anti-emetic drugs in the treatment of vomiting

 There is some moderate evidence that shows that for neck pain, acupuncture is more effective than pseudo-treatment and offers short-term improvement compared to those on the waiting list

 There is some conflicting evidence that acupuncture can be useful for osteoarthritis of the knee and the results are positive as well as negative
 The Osteoarthritis Research Society International issued a consensus recommendation in 2008 that concluded that acupuncture may be useful in treating symptoms of knee osteoarthritis

 For the following situation, the Cochrane Collaboration has concluded that the evidence is insufficient to decide whether acupuncture is profitable because of lack of research and poor quality, and whether more research is still needed: acupankchar kii prabhavakaarita par kuch adhyayanon ke sakaaratmak parinaam, kharaab tareeke se taiyaar adhyayan athwa prakaashan purvaagrah kaa ek parinaam ho sakate hai
 Edjard Ernst and Simone Singh state that the quality of experimental trials of acupuncture has increased over the course of several decades
 The results have shown at least little evidence that acupuncture is better than cryptology for treating most conditions

 In 2003, an acupuncturist published a report on acupuncture through the World Health Organization's Department of Compulsory Drugs and Medical Policy, in which the author listed a series of diseases, symptoms, or conditions for which the author believed that acupuncture was an effective treatment
 is: report main anya dashaaen bhi soochibaddh thim jinke liye lekhak ne mana ki acupankchar se prabhavi taur par ilaaj kiya ja saktaa he
 The objectives of the report were presented as follows: report par maanak asveekaran ne note kiya ki WHO "pramanit nahin karata he ki is prakaashan main maujuud jaankaree purna or sahi he or iske upyog ke parinamswaroop kisi kshati ke liye uttaradaayi nahin hoga
 " report vivaadaaspad thi; aalochak us par samasyagrast ke rup main tut pade, chunki, asveekaran ke baavjood, samarthakon ne yah daawa karne ke liye iskaa istemaal kiya ki WHO ne acupankchar or anya vaikalpik chikitsa paddatiyon kaa samarthan kiya he, jo yaa to chhadam-vaigyanik the yaa unamem paryaapt saboot kii kami thi
 Medical scientists expressed concern that the evidence outlined in the report in support of acupuncture was weak, and said the WHO favored the practice of physicians practicing alternative medicine

 In 1997, the following statement was adopted as a policy by the American Medical Association, a consortium of medical doctors and medical students, following reports on myriad alternative treatments including acupuncture: ' "there are very few practices that confirm the safety and efficacy of most alternative medicine methods
 in upachaaron ke bare main samprati gyaat adhikansh soochna yah spasht karte hai ki kai prabhavotpadak prathit nahin hote hai

 Another survey found that 402 out of 3535 treatments resulted in bleeding, bruising, dizziness, fainting, vomiting, dyspepsia, increased pain, and in one case vaglope
 us surveykshan ne nishkarsh nikaala: "kisi bhi chikitsiya abhigam kii tarah acupankchar ke bhi pratikul prabhaav hai

 " Other wound risks from improperly pricking acupuncture needles include: acupankchar chikitsakon ke samuchit prashikshan ke madhyam se jokhim ko kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Graduates of medical schools and accredited acupuncture schools receive thorough education on appropriate techniques so that these incidents can be avoided

 The Treaty of Versailles took place at the end of the First World War between Germany and the coalition countries
 pratham vishwayuddh ke baad parajeet germany ne 28 june 1919 ke din varsay kii sandhi par hastakshar kiye
 This led to Germany losing a large part of its land, banning the occupation of other states, limiting the size of their army and imposing heavy compensation
 varsay kii sandhi ko germany par jabardastee thopa gaya tha
 For this reason Adolf Hitler and other Germans considered it disgraceful and thus the treaty was one of the causes of World War II

 This time Germany was not given the opportunity to submit any amendment or request regarding the terms of the treaty
 mitrarashtron ne spasht kar diya tha ki hastakshar nahin karne kaa arth germany par punah akraman hoga
 Finally, the German government accepted the signing of the treaty

 These treaties are sharply criticized and understood as the seeds of this Second World War
 nimna binduon ke tahat is sandhi kii aalochana ko dekha ja saktaa he- 1
 Accused Treaty: The Treaty of Warsaw is known as the "accusatory peace", that is, the "accusatory treaty"

 This was the order of the Allies which Germany had no other remedy except to accept
 german pratinidhiyon ke dwaara sikaayat karne par bhi unhen dhamkee di gayi kii yadi ve paanch din ke andar sandhi par hastakshar nahin kiye to unke khilaaf punah akraman kar diya jaayegaa
 Therefore, it sat on the mind of Germany that it is an alleged treaty which they are not obliged to obey
 yahi vajah he ki germany ne aage chalakar sandhi praavdhaanon ko thukraa diya

 No peace of public, peace of diplomats: The provisions mentioned in the Treaty of Versailles could not fulfill the interests and aspirations of the general public
 isamen kai aisi pradeshik vyavasthaayen thi jisamen sanshodhan kii jarurat thi
 Several provisions were made in compensation that could not be recovered without causing devastating blow to the industrial revival of Europe
 is tarah jansadharan kii shanti kaa yah sandhi puraa nahin karti

 Strict and Disgraceful Conditions: Germany was shattered by the Treaty of Warsaw, the colonies were stripped financially, the ownership of other nations over economic resources, and the military was crippled
 
 kshatipurti kii shart atyant kathor evam apmanjanak thi
 In the event of non-payment of compensation amount, there was talk of occupying the territories of Germany
 vastutah vijeta raashtra ne pratishodh ke tahat kathor sharton ko germany par ladaa
 The terms of the treaty were so harsh that no self-respecting, cultured nation could bear it

 sandhi galat sthanon par kathor tathaa galat tareeke se naram thi : yah sandhi keval asaamaanya rup se kathor nahin thi, varan galat sthanon par kathor tathaa galat tareeke se naram thi
 The attempt by Germany to approve so-called war crime provisions was beyond reality because, as David Thomson put it, "mentioning this in a draft that the German delegates were forced to sign cannot create a sense of sense of responsibility
" Were

 How it would be possible for the Germans to repay this wealth economically and for the Allies was not analyzed
 nihsandeh dand or muaavje kaa sampurna aakaar aviveki or avyavhaarik tha
 All the above mentioned unnecessary rigors did not take any distinct action against Germany's ability to express national dissatisfaction and anger
 yah sandhi galat tareeke se naram thi, 'saar kshetra' kaa raashtra sangh dwaara 15 varsh tak shashan or 1935 main use germany kaa lautaa dena shaayad hi uchit tha
 The authority of the Allies on Rhineland for 15 years also proved hollow

 pratishodhatmak sandhi : vijeta rashtron ne pratishodhatmak ravaiya apanaakar kathor sharton ko germany par ladaa
 France was seeking to avenge its old defeat and non-compliance, so that the treaty made the most stringent provisions with Germany

 apmanjanak sandhi : yah sandhi germany ke liye rashtriya apmaan kaa kaaran thi
 The overthrow of Kaiser William, recovery of heavy damage supply

 Clemenceau's indecent behavior with German delegates coming for the signing of treaty letters, keeping them as prisoners, abusing the public, throwing rotten fruit, bricks, stones at them, was not an insult to the delegates but to Germany
 7
 vishwasghaatee sandhi : varsay kii sandhi naitik drushti se anuchit va germany ke saath vishwasghaat maani gai
 Germany had accepted a war tax treaty based on Wilson's 14 sources, but these treaties of Wilson were openly violated in the Treaty of Warsaw
 germany ke saath rashtriyata ke siddhant kaa paalan nahin hua tha
 Many conditions were imposed on him
 lekin vijetaon ko usase mukt rakhaa gaya he
 According to Wilson's third source, the attempt was to remove all barriers to international trade, but Germany's collective freedom was not protected
 uskaa antarrashtriya vyapaar varshon tak mitrarashtron ke niyantran main rahaa
 The 14 sources suggested the reduction of arms of all nations, but the Allies severely limited Germany's military power without reducing their arms
 mitra rashtron ne wilson ke 14 sutron kaa paalan usee seemaa tak kiya jahaan tak unhen laabh tha
 Thus Germany was betrayed in the Treaty of Warsaw
 is vishwasghaat kaa badla lene ke liye aage germany ne yuddh kiya

 Ideological Conflicts among the Prophets of the Treaty: The Treaty of Varsay provided a status of conflict among the three elders' opinions and objectives
 wilson ke ucch parantu avyaavhaarik vichaar, climenso ke rashtravaadi va yathartwaadee maangon tathaa lid george ke avasarwaadi uddeshyon ke bich virodh tha, baavjood iske varsay kii sandhi par inaki sahmati thi jo inke samrajyavaadee va shoshan kii maansikta ko pratibibint karata he
 According to Logson "there was intense opposition to Wilson's idealism and materialism of convention, and in most cases materialism emerged victorious
" ” 9
 Beginning of new phase of Conflict: The Treaty of Warsaw marked the beginning of a new struggle for universal power among European nations
 1919 tak anterrashtriya vidhi kisi desh kii sarkaar tathaa uske nagarikon kii sampatti main bhed maanati thi
 But according to the treaty of Warsay, the warring country could seize some kind of property of a person of an enemy country within the border of himself and his allies
 yadi vah yuddh main vijayi hua to parajeet desh kii sarkaar ko apane nagarikon kii idas prakaar jabt kii gai sampatti kii kshatipurti karne ke liye baadhya kar saktaa tha
 This was a new parable

 Among all the liberal features, it was considered as an institution established by the enemy party
 isliye germany main prajatantr aarambh se hi dwandv, ghrinapatr va shatrupaksh kii vyavastha ban gaya

 Disregard of the principle of self-determination: The boundaries of Italy were not set on the principle of nationalism, nor were all citizens on Poland's land unquestionably polled

 The doctrine of self-judgment concerning Germany was disregarded
 raashtrapati wilson ke aatmanirnay ke siddhant ke anusaar europe ke anek rashtron kaa punargathan kiya gaya tha
 According to this, it was decided to create a separate system of people of the same nation, caste, language and cultural tradition
 isi aadhaar par checkoslovakia, poland, yugoslavia ke swatantra rajyon kaa janm hua
 But this principle was not followed in relation to Germany, Austria and Hungary
 germany ke hajaaron nagarikon ko german samrajya se pruthak karke anya rajyon ke adheen kar diya gaya
 "in 1918 AD, when the Austrian Germans established the german-austrian Republic and expressed the desire of the Germans to join the Republic and annex the land, the Allied States banned the annexation of the two states in September 1919 AD
 Gone
 is prakaar mitra rashtron dwaara swayan dwaara sweekrut siddhant ko germany ke vishay main kriyanvit na kar german nagarikon ko niraash kiya gaya
 According to Butlerne, "not using the principle of self-determination in a reasonable sense was an indication of the inherent weakness in the Parisian system
" ” The treaty of Versailles has a special place in the most discussed treaties of world history and its effects
 us sandhi ke kathor praavdhaanon or uske swaroop ke sandarbh main aalochakon ne ise dwitiya vishwayuddh ke kaaran ke rup main paribhaashit kiya he
 According to him, the Treaty of Warsaw was the father of discontent rather than a system of peace
 sandhi ke thik 20 varsh 2 maheene 4 din pashchaat yah sansar dwitiya vishwayuddh ke chapet main aa gaya
 Since the treaty, its arrangements were disbanded by Germany
 saath hi sandhi praavdhaanon main sanshodhan bhi kiye jate rahe
 Violations and amendments of these treaty provisions pushed the world towards World War II
 sandhi praavdhaanon kaa ulanghan evam sanshodhan isliye kiya gaya ki yah atyadhik kathor evam apmanjanak thi
 No self-respecting nation could tolerate the terms of such a harsh and degrading treaty for a long time
 atah yah spasht tha ki germany bhavishya main uparyukt avasar milte hi varsay sandhi dwaara thopi gai vyavastha se mukt hone tathaa apmaan ke kalank dhone kaa prayaas karegaa
 Ezberger of the Catholic Center Party of Germany said at the time of the cease-fire treaty that "the German race will suffer but will not die
 " swabhaavik rup se germany ne is apmanjanak sharton ko dhone kaa safal prayaas kiya
 As a result, within a few years the political atmosphere of Europe became very turbulent and the world had to witness a fierce and catastrophic war even more than the First World War
 france ke marshall foch ke anusaar bhi "yah sandhi shanti nahin he, keval 20 varshon kaa yudhviram he
 "it is clear that the seeds of World War II existed in this treaty
 1919 main sandhi ke samay germany asahaay tha or sandhi ke chupchaap sweekaar karne ke alaava uske paas koi chaara na tha lekin jaise-jaise samay bitta gaya vaise-vaise vah kuch shakti sanchay karke sandhi kii sharton kaa ulanghan karne laga or sandhi nirmaataaon ne bhi usamen sanshodhan kiye
 The first part of the treaty was amended in 1926 when Germany was granted membership of the League of Nations
 yuddh aparaadhiyon sambandhi saatvaan bhaag kabhi purnatah kriyanvit nahin kiya gaya
 Many of the war criminals, including the German Emperor William Kaiser, were punished and only a few were given general punishment
 kshatipurti se sambandhit praavdhaan ko pehle to sanshodhit kiya gaya or baad main purnatah tyaag diya gaya
 The question of indemnification at the Lojan Conference was abolished
 1933-34 main german raajnneeti main hitler ke utkarsh ke baad varsay kii sharton ko todna to ek maamuli baat ho gai
 In 1935–36, Hitler violated the provisions relating to disarmament of the treaty and increased armies and in 1936 took control of Rheinland
 march 1938 main austria ko germany ke saath milakar tathaa sitambar 1938 checkoslovakia ko milakar hitler ne varsay kii sandhi ke pradeshik vyavasthaaon ke praavdhaanon ko bhang kar diya
 World War II started when Hitler invaded Poland with the aim of breaking the Polish Corridor and Danzing Port-related arrangements made by Poland under the Treaty of Versailles
 kuch milakar varsay sandhi kii anyaaypurna vyavasthaaon ko todane ke liye hi hitler ne ghatnaon kii vah shrunkhlaa aarambh kii jiske kaaran dwitiya vishwayuddh kaa visphot hua
 In this way, the final culmination of the process of elimination of the Treaty provisions of Versailles occurred at the beginning of the Second World War
 is drushti se dwitiya vishwayuddh ke beej varsay kii sandhi main dekhe ja sakate hai
 Some critics believe that the World War II was not the harsh condition of the Versailles treaty, but the laxity in implementing them
 logsam ke anusaar- Thus there is no doubt that the unjustly harsh and degrading treaty of Versailles was to a extent liable to World War II
 kintu yah bhi satya he ki mitra rashtron kii paraspar virdohi niti, upeksha, udaseenta, tushtikaran or sandhi kii sharton ko kathortapurvak lagu na karwaane kii niti bhi iske liye kam uttaradaayi nahin thi

 Adam Smith was a Scottish politician, philosopher and political economist
 unhen arthshaastra kaa pitamah bhi kaha jaataa he
 Adam Smith's name comes first among the makers of modern economics
 His book 'the wealth of nations has greatly influenced the historians and economists of the eighteenth century
 From Karl Marx to David Ricardo, many eminent economists, sociologists and politicians have taken inspiration from Adam Smith
 Among twentieth-century economists who drew inspiration from Adam Smith's ideas,the names of Marx, Engels, Malthus, Mill, Cannes and Friedman are notable
 Adam Smith himself was influenced by scholars such as Aristotle, John Lock, Hobbs, Mendville, Francis Hutcheson, Hume etc
 Smith did notable work in the fields of economics, political philosophy and ethics
 But he got special recognition only in the field of economics
 Modern marketism can also be seen as a recognition of the views of Adam Smith
 The date of birth of Adam Smith is not sure
 Some scholars consider him to be born on 5 June 1723 and some on 16 June of the same year
 Whatever it was, he was born in Kirkaldi, a village in Scotland
 Adam's father was in charge of the customs department
 But he died almost six months before Smith's birth
 Adam was possibly the only child of his parents
 He was still only four years old that suffered trauma
 Adam was kidnapped by an organization of Gypsies
 At that time his uncle assisted his mother
 Adam was consequently secured
 After his father's death, Smith was sent by his mother to study at the University of Glasgow
 At that time, Smith was only fourteen years old
 Due to his sharp intellect, he completed school level with good marks, due to which he started getting scholarship
 Which opened the way to Oxford University for further studies
 There he gained knowledge of ancient European languages
 By that time, it could not be decided that the student of linguistics would not only earn a name in the field of economics in the future, but would also make an epoch-making contribution in the field of global economy on the basis of its fundamental installations
 In 1738, Smith passed the bachelor's examination in moral philosophy under the leadership of renowned scholar-philosopher Francis Hutchinson
 He was deeply influenced by Francis' intelligence and considered him and his days spent teaching, unforgettable
 Being very talented, Smith's talent was started to be recognized from the college level itself
 Therefore, after completing his studies, when young Smith returned to his native city of Scotland, by the time he had given many important lectures, his fame began to spread
 While living there, he studied David Hume's famous work a Treatise of Human Nature in 1740, which impressed him immensely
 David Hume was one of his role models
 The two had a deep friendship
 Hume himself was highly impressed by Rousseau's talent
 An incident is mentioned behind the friendship of both
 According to which Hume once saw Rousseau's personal diary, he saw religion, Serious comments were made about society, politics, economics etc
 After that incident, the two became close friends
 Hume was almost ten years older than Adam Smith
 In addition to David Hume, the names of John Smith, Hugh Blair, Lord Hallis, and Principal Robertson, among the prominent friends of Adam Smith, are notable
 He got the first offerings of his hard work and talent quickly
 In 1751, Smith got a job as a spokesperson for logic at the University of Glasgow
 The following year, he was made the head of the department of moral philosophy
 Smith's work of writing and teaching was going on continuously
 In 1759, he completed his book 'principle of moral sensations'
 This book became the subject of discussion with its publication
 In addition to his English, German and French versions started selling hands-on
 The book was about the relationships and moral behavior of the individual and society
 By that time, Smith's tendency was limited to political philosophy and ethics
 Gradually Smith began to get bored with the monotonous and monotonous environment of the universities
 He began to realize that what he wanted to do was not possible to do it in the college environment
 Meanwhile, his tendency towards economics was increased
 Especially during the teaching on political philosophy, economic aspects were also considered in the lecturers
 His ideas were compiled by a student of his own, who later edited by Edwin Cannon
 Only in those articles were the elements of 'wealth of Nations' safe
 After spending nearly twelve years in the field of teaching, Smith resigned from his college job and started teaching tuition to earn a living
 During this period he traveled to France and European countries and met contemporary scholars David Hume, Voltaire, Rousseau, Francis Quesne, Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, etc
 Meanwhile, he also wrote many research essays, due to which his reputation increased
 He returned to Kirkaldi a few years later
 While living in his native village, Smith completed his most talked about book, The Wealth of Nations, a unique book on political science and economics
 With the publication of the book in 1776, Adam Smith began to be counted among the scholarly scholars of his time
 Philosophy has influence on this book
 Those who are not familiar with Smith's life will be surprised to learn that Smith wrote this book in connection with his teaching work as a philosophy professor
 In those days, books of history and philosophy were taught more in universities, there was also a subject of theological studies
 The study of jurisprudence simply means a detailed study of the judicial system naturally
 Contemplation of Government and then Economy of Economy
 In this way it is clear that in his book 'wealth of Nations', Smith has given philosophical discussions of economic principles
 The novelty of the subject and the original style of presentation are the main features of the book
 He had a rich library, which contained hundreds of rare texts
 He liked to live in a quiet and secluded environment, where no one would interrupt his life
 Smith remained a bachelor for a lifetime
 Work should not be hurt by the absence of happiness and the presence of unrest in life, so he said that society should be formed on the basis of the usefulness of human beings, such as merchant groups are formed; Not on mutual attachment or any other emotional basis
 Adam Smith's fame in the field of economics is due to his well-known theory, 'leje Fair', which later became the promoter of liberal economic policies
 Leje Fair meant 'freedom to work', that is, minimal government intervention in the field of economic activities
 The correct information about the true origins of this slogan that propounds modern industrial capitalism and revolutionized the production system is not claimed
 But there is a popular legend in this regard, according to which this utterance was born in 1680, during the meeting of the then influential French Finance Minister jean-baptiste Colbert with the traders of his own country
 The leadership of the team of traders was M
 Lee
 Was doing gendry a team of traders had reached Colbert with their problems
 In those days, traders were facing an ever increasing competition in the production system on the one hand, on the other hand government laws seemed binding on them
 After listening to them, Colbert expressed some resentment and said - "what can the government do to help businessmen in this?" Took on Gendry immediately responded in a simplistic tone - 'lease-now Fair
' His intention was, 'you leave us on our condition, let us only do our work
' As the popularity of this theory grew, Adam Smith gained recognition as an economist
 At that time, Adam Smith did not know that he was representing an economical theory that would one day prove to be revolutionary for the global economy
 Two years after the publication of a book titled 'nation's Wealth', Smith was commissioned in the Customs Department
 Got a job The same year he was shocked when he got the news of the death of his close friend and famous philosopher David Hume of his time
 The post of Custom Commissioner proved to be a challenge for Smith
 While in that position he had to deal with the problem of smuggling; Which he had established in his book The Wealth of Nations as 'universal deeds behind the face of unnatural legislation'
 When the Edinburgh Royal Society was established in 1783, Smith was named its founding member
 For Smith's special services in the field of economics and politics, he was nominated as Honorary Rector of Glasg University
 He remained unmarried for a lifetime
 Due to being busy in study and teaching night and day, his health started getting messed up
 He finally died in Edinburgh on 19 July 1790, at the age of sixty-six

 vaichariki Adam Smith is considered one of the makers of the modern economy
 Inspired by his ideas, while socialist thinkers like Karl Marx, Engels, Mill, Ricardo carried forward their ideology, the seed of modern state economy is also rooted in Smith's ideas
 Smith's economic social thinking is contained in his two books
 The first book is titled - Principles of Moral Feeling "in which he has attempted to review human behavior
 The book is influenced by Smith teacher Francis Hutcheson
 In the book, moral philosophy has been divided into four classes - morality, virtue, sense of personal rights and freedom
 In this book, Smith classifies the entire moral behavior of man into two parts — 1
 Nature of morality 2
 Goal of ethics In the nature of morality, Smith has included property, desires etc
 While in the second category, Smith has reviewed human sensibilities, selfishness, longing etc
 Smith's second important book is 'exploring the nature of the wealth of the nation and its reasons' This unique book is in five volumes
 In the book, various topics such as political science, economics, human behavior etc
 have been considered, but it mainly analyzes Smith's economic ideas
 Smith, while supporting the free economy, has shown how to protect our interests in such times, how to make the maximum profit of technology, how a welfare state can be tested on the basis of religiosity and How can society be taken on the path of development through commercial competition
 Smith's ideology presents this analysis in a very objective way
 Smith has also been accused of being an individualist because of this book
 But scholars who consider Smith a staunch individualist may be shocked by the fact that most of his work is focused on human morality and public welfare
 In his second book, 'the Principle of Moral Perceptions', Smith writes —' How can the concept of a completely selfish person be well? There are definitely some principles of nature that make it necessary for him to relate his happiness to others, by which he does not get anything other than to see them happy
 ' The victim may think that there are really some laws of nature that can prove beneficial for him in the fate of others and happiness for him Can cause
 Whereas this is its sheer illusion
 He could not think of anything except this
 In one place, Smith has written, referring to the monotony and limitations of human behavior, that "we do not have an authentic experience of what the other person thinks
" Nor do we have any knowledge about what it actually affects
 Except that we can guess something by imagining ourselves to be in those circumstances
 We can also be relaxed by seeing our brother standing on the balcony, regardless of what is going on
 Our sensations remain dormant about his condition
 They neither go beyond our 'us', nor can they go; That is, we can only guess about its actual condition
 There is no power in his consciousness that can give us a real sense of his troubles and state of mind, until the time we think of ourselves by putting ourselves in his circumstances
 But our own thinking is only our thinking and concept, not his
 Through imagination, we are only able to guess his position
 '' Smith has given the exact position by the above quote
 a lot of our everyday behavior is done only through conjecture and imagination
 Smith has also taken the side of personal happiness without any hesitation while avoiding the unexpected pressures of emotion and morality
 According to him, loving himself, taking care of his comforts and making necessary efforts for him is not ineffective or immoral in any sense
 He said that life will become very difficult if our tender sensations and love, which is our core emotion, start controlling our behavior all the time, and there is no desire for the welfare of others; Or he started to consider the defense of his ego as the best, and neglecting others should become his religion
 Empathy and personal benefits are mutually complementary rather than conflicting with each other
 Humans continue to get opportunities to help others
 In a treatise called 'the wealth of nations', Smith explains benevolence and welfare in a very objective manner
 According to Smith, due to lack of practice, our psyche is not ready to accept such beliefs, although our conduct continues to point to the same
 The duality that exists within our heart keeps churning us
 At one place, he writes that it is impossible to fulfill the needs only on the basis of religion or charity
 The presence of personal interests is also mandatory for him
 He writes - 'our food is not a gift of kindness to a butcher, a wine-maker or a tandoorwala
 It is a reward for the work done for themselves, for their inherent benefit
 'according to the smith, if a man works hard for earning, it is his work done for his own happiness
 But its effect is not limited to that itself
 In the process of earning, he somehow connects with others
 They take their support and through their product, they fulfill the needs of their society as well
 In order to earn something in the competition, he has to produce something different from others
 The ratio of the specificity of production and the technology used for production determines its success
 In the treatise titled 'wealth of Nations', Smith writes that -' Every entrepreneur is constantly striving to make maximum profit on his investment amount
 He does this work for himself, only with his good wishes and not for the welfare of the society
 It is also true that for his own good, he tries to take his business as much as possible, expanding production and employment opportunities as much as possible
 But late in the process, society also has the benefit
 In the book 'wealth of Nations' written in five volumes, Smith has also tried to explain the reasons for the prosperity of a nation and their nature
 But his insistence has been to minimize control over the economy
 According to Smith, the first reason for prosperity is a favorable division of labor
 Here, the meaning of compatibility is to make the maximum productive by using the efficiency of any person
 An example of Smith to illustrate this fact has been very popular — imagine that ten artisans could make forty-eight thousand pins a day, provided that their production process is divided into individual parts
 Any special task of production process should be assigned
 Someday if even one of them is absent; One of them could hardly make a pin in a day
 Because the efficiency of a particular artisan is the ability to complete any one stage of the production process
 'smith was in favor of free trade
 He said that governments should take up all those laws which work to frustrate the producers by hindering the development of productivity
 He opposed the trade-related laws that were being run by tradition and said that such laws negatively impact productivity
 It has also opposed taxes levied in the name of imports and laws supporting it
 In the field of economics, his theory is known as 'lassé Fair'
 Which means - Let them work voluntarily
 In other words, Smith wanted his release of control for the smoothness of the production process
 He was in favor of specialization of production rather than expansion of production area, So that maximum benefit of mechanical skills and human labor is taken
 Production should be cheap and reach the maximum
 He said that - 'if any country is willing to give any item cheaper than the cost of production in our country, then it is our duty to buy it from there
 And plan the labor and resources of our country in such a way that it can be as effective as possible and we can take appropriate advantage of it
 Should be without any mutual benefit or desire
 The desire to produce is the basic driving force of entrepreneurship
 But there is no possibility of profit with production, if the law instead of helping, stands in its way, then its desire may also die
 In that case both that person and the nation are at a disadvantage
 According to Smith — 'consumption is directly related to production
 Any person produces because he wishes to produce
 On fulfilling the desire, he can opt out of the production process or even postpone the production process for some time
 When a person produces more than what he needs, at that time he wishes to take additional production, by which he can shuffle any other thing from another person
 If a person aspires for something and makes something else, then it may be his desire to produce that he can exchange it with the things that he desires and get well from him
 As he could have made them himself
 'smith considered the division of work completely natural and supported it in a free voice
 This shows his scientific vision and foresight
 On the basis of his ideas, America and European countries adopted the free economy
 The relevance of his ideas remains unchanged even after centuries
 Even radical communist countries like China and Russia remain advocates of free economy to remain in the industrial competition
 Analyzing different aspects of production, Smith said that the contribution of workers and artisans in the success of industries also does not diminish
 They invest in their labor skills and help them in production
 Smith has also written that in a place where it is difficult to understand the trend of production, the rates of wages can be higher than normal
 Because people, unless they have no additional benefit, will not like to learn
 The possibility of additional wages or higher than normal earnings motivates them to adopt the new method
 In this way, Smith has indicated specific symptoms of spontaneous mankind
 Similarly, such works where a person has to work in adverse conditions from the point of view of health or in factories running in unsafe places will have to keep the wages rates higher than normal
 Otherwise, people will continue to run for wages in safe and preferred locations and there will be a lack of trained personnel in such factories
 Smith has used the facts in every place in a very balanced and rational manner
 In his book 'wealth of Nations' he makes it clear that the difference in the trend of work can be balanced with the difference of salary
 a feature of his writing is also that he uses facts and arguments to explain the matter rather than a long description
 Smith's ideas about internationalization of the production system also meet the test of modern economy
 In this regard, he was of the opinion that - If a foreign country is ready to provide us with relatively cheaper consumer goods, it would be appropriate to order it from there
 Because only through that some productive power of our country will be used to carry out such works which are more important and beneficial
 Ultimately we will benefit from this arrangement
 'smith's installations during the analysis are not limited to merely describing the production technology of pins or simply showing the difference between the salaries of a butcher and a rickshaw puller
 Rather, on the pretext of this, he also works to solve the complex political issues of nations
 The trend of making international strategy through economic relations has become common nowadays
 Rich industrialized countries do this work with great efficiency
 But his seedling has existed in Smith's contemplation since the eighteenth century
 In the fourth book of the 'wealth of Nations' series, in 1776, Smith clearly told the British government that the expenditure on his American colonies was more than his own value
 Explaining the reason for this, he said that the British monarchy is a very expensive system
 He had proved on the basis of the data that instead of political control, a clean economy can be a more effective system for control
 He was in favor of keeping the government away from economic issues
 In this case, Smith was ahead of certain modern economists
 But if everything is to be done by the capitalists or the system created with their cooperation through economic policies, then what is the responsibility of the government? What can she do to maintain her supremacy? In this regard, Smith had a very clear view that the government is seeking patent law, contracts, Can maintain its control through arrangements such as license and copyright
 Not only this, the government can keep the works of public importance such as building bridges, roads, restrooms etc
 under its control, where people can benefit from the prosperity of the nation
 In priority areas, in areas where entrepreneurs have less interest to work, the government can discharge its duties by maintaining the pace of development
 Smith's ideas in support of the capital system are practical in many places, and sometimes he seems to be crossing the boundaries of redundancy
 He was supportive of turning the government into a complementary system rather than a self-governing authority
 Whose task is to help productivity as much as possible
 He also thought that citizens should also pay the prescribed fee in proportion to the use of facilities
 But this does not mean that Smith wanted to completely free governments from the responsibility of their citizens
 He believed — 'no society can be considered happy and prosperous as long as the majority of its members are poor, unhappy and depressed
' Smith was an advocate of free competition in terms of trade and production technology
 He believed that the arrival of competition in the field of economy would be in accordance with 'natural law'
 Smith's natural law is certainly an extension of the law of the forest, in which the survival of life makes the struggle mandatory
 The concept of cooperatives was not born in Smith's time, the idea of socialism was also in the womb of the development of public consciousness
 On one hand, he insisted on making the production more competitive by linking it to the competition
 On the other hand, by interconnecting production and morality, he showed the way to keep the face of the production system humane
 However, why should the bourgeoisie, which considers maximum profit as its best, follow morality without any selfishness, why should it be such a compulsion? He has not given any indication towards this
 Yet Smith's ideas have been the most original and influential in his time
 Smith had said earnestly that "in any civilized society, man needs the support and cooperation of others
" Whereas, to make a few friends, one life remains inadequate
 Among creatures, an organism moving towards adulthood is usually used to be lonely and independent
 Helping others is not a part of his nature
 But this is not the case with humans
 He is always worried about the welfare of his brothers and relatives for his selfishness
 Obviously, man expects the same for himself
 Because it is impossible for him to carry on with the wishes of the only person
 He will work to make his relationship even stronger, if he can make a place for himself in their pleasures
 He will also try to show that it is in his own interest to do all the tasks that he expects from them
 Whatever duty a man performs towards others, it is a kind of bargain - that is, you give me what i want, in return you will get everything you wish for
 This is the principle of giving something to someone, this is the only way through which our social relations get expanded and on whose support this world runs
 Our food is not a gift to the kindness of any butcher, winemaker or oven seller
 This is a byproduct of work done for themselves, for their inherent benefit
 'thus we see that Adam Smith's economic ideas are not only practical, original and far-sighted; Rather, even today, he is retaining his publicity
 Perhaps it would be more appropriate to say that they are more relevant today than before
 In his ideology, we do not see any deviation of thoughts or sense of confusion
 Smith also had full faith in beliefs, which is why he could gather many facts to support his argument
 This is why Smith was as impressed by the economists that followed; No other economist of that period was able to do the same
 However, Adam Smith had to face criticism from the people for his views
 Some scholars think that his views are influenced by the book of Endorser Chandinius, 'the National Gain and David Hume'
 Some scholars have also accused him of promoting anarchic capitalism
 But it is only fair to assess the views of any scholar in its totality
 Scholars who assess Smith's ideas are often limited to industrial production ideas, forgetting that Smith's ideas of production include the duties of government and citizens
 However, his ideological sharpness has also been praised by his sharp opponents
 Many scholars and researchers of the world are still engaged in analyzing its economic principles
 If the relevance of the views of a scholar remains after centuries, then it is definitely a symbol of his greatness
 While Smith has not only influenced generations of scholars, but has also produced several generations of economists
 They forget that Smith's production ideas also include the duties of government and citizens

 Telephoto photography or 'telegraphy' or 'telephotography' is the method of sending pictures from one place to another by electrical signals

 This is called the carrier frequency number

 ] The carbon dioxide from the air reacts with the alkali in the cement and makes the pore water more acidic, thus lowering the ph
 Carbon dioxide will start to carbonate the cement in the concrete from the moment the object is made
 This carbonatation process will start at the surface, then slowly move deeper and deeper into the concrete
 If the object is cracked, the carbon dioxide of the air will be better able to penetrate into the concrete
 When designing a concrete structure, it is normal to state the concrete cover for the rebar
 The minimum concrete cover is normally regulated by design or building codes
 If the reinforcement is too close to the surface, early failure due to corrosion may occur
 One method of testing a structure for carbonatation is to drill a fresh hole in the surface and then treat the surface with phenolphthalein
 This will turn when in contact with alkaline cement, making it possible to see the depth of carbonatation
 An existing hole is no good because the exposed surface will already be carbonated---> ] This phenomenon has been popularly referred to as "concrete cancer"

 Prithviraj Chauhan) was a Hindu Kshatriya king of the Chauhan dynasty, who ruled Ajmer and Delhi in north India in the late 12th century
 ve bharateshwar, prithvirajtrutiy, hindoosamrat, sapadalaksheshwar, raay pithora ityadi naam se prasiddh hai
 Famous as the last Hinduuraja of India, Prithviraj ascended the throne at the age of fifteen in 1235 Vikram Samvatsar
 prithviraj kii teraa raaneeyaan thi
 Sanyogita is considered to be the most famous among them
 prithviraj ne digvijay abhiyaan main 1177 varsh main bhadanak deshiy ko, 1182 varsh main jejakabhukti shaasha ko or 1183 varsh main chalukya vansheey shaasha ko parajeet kiya
 During these years, a warrior eater named Ghori in the north of India was defeating many districts with deceit or force, wishing to expand his rule and religion
 uski shashan vistaar kii or dharm vistaar kii nit ke falswaroop 1175 varsh se prithviraj kaa ghori ke saath sangharsh aarambh hua
 After that many small and medium wars took place between Prithviraj and Ghori
 vibhinn granthon main jo yuddh sankhyaayein milti he, ve sankhya 7, 17, 21 or 28 hai
 In all the wars, Prithviraj made Ghori a prisoner and left him
 parantu antim baar narin ke dwitiya yuddh main prithviraj kii paraajay ke pashchaat ghori ne prithviraj ko bandi banaaya or kuch dinon tak 'islam'-dharm kaa angikaar karwaane kaa prayaas karata rahaa
 In that attempt, Prithviraj was given physical pains
 shareerik yatnaa dene ke samay ghori ne prithviraj ko andhaa kar diya
 The blind Prithviraj sought to retaliate his defeat by killing Ghori with a wordless arrow
 parantu deshadroh ke kaaran unki wo yojana bhi vifal ho gai
 And when Ghori was unable to change Prithviraj's determination, he killed the blind Prithviraj

 According to the opinion of historian Dr
 Bindhyanath Chauhan, Prithviraj practiced the said verse till the last time

 Prithviraj's father was Someshwar, mother Karpoodevi
 prithviraj ke anuj kaa naam hariraj, choti bahan kaa naam prutha tha
 Prithviraj had thirteen queens
 prithviraj kaa ek putr tha, jiskaa naam govind tha
 History tells that, after the birth of a son, Father Someshwar requests the Rajpurohits to tell their son's future
 uske pashchaat balak kaa bhagyafal dekh kar raajpurohiton ne "prithviraj" namakaran kiya
 Naming is mentioned in Prithviraj Vijay epic - chaturvarnadhanan naam prithviraj iti vyadhaat

 To make the earth holy and to make the word "raj" meaningful, this prince is named "prithviraj"
 'prithviraj raso' kavy main bhi namakaran kaa varnan karte hue chandrabadai likhte hai – Happiness is an organ when there is joy prithviraj naamak balak maharaajaaon ke chhatra apane bal se har legaa
 The glory of the throne will increase, that is, in the Kali Yuga, the earth will be resplendent like the sun
 kumarpal ke shashan main chalukyon ke prasaad main janma prithviraj baalyavastha se hi vaibhavpurn vaataavaran main bada hua
 Prithviraj had an abundance of introductions to the grand estate

 The child's Krishna hair and madhukar speech fascinated the mind

 Brighter teeth were as gratifying as diamonds
 netra main kiya gaya anjan aakarshan badhaata tha
 When the child roamed here and there on his knees, his clothes were dusty

 When Someshwar went to Ajmeru from the kingdom of Chalukya dynasty, he was accompanied by his wife Karpoodevi, two sons Prithviraj and Hariraj
 1226 vikram sanvatsar main gujarat rajya se jab someshwar ajmeru pradesh main sthaanantarit hue, tab prithviraj kii aayu paanch varsh thi
 Prithviraj studied at Ajayameru Prasad and at the Saraswati Kantabharan Vidyapeeth established by Vigraharaj
 prasaad or viapeeth ke prangan main yudhkala or shastr vidya kaa gyaan prithviraj ne praapt kiya
 Although Sanskrit was the official language of the Chauhan dynasty Sramajya of Shakambhari since time immemorial, yet in other languages there was also Vagavyahavara
 parantu sanskrit adikaal se shakambhari kii rajbhasha thi ye praapt shilalekhon se gyaat hota he
 He has also demonstrated his Sanskrit knowledge from the texts composed by Vigraharaj and by his royal poet
 vigraharaj ke raajakavi somdev ne 'lalitvigraharajah' naamak naatak kii rachana kii thi
 He skillfully used the six languages prevalent in that play
 shila lekhon ke vistrut adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki, chouhan vansh ke kaal main mukhyatya chah bhashaayen prachlit thim
 They are as follows - Sanskrit, Prakrit, Magadhi, Paishachi, Shaurseni and Apabhransh languages
 prithviraj vijay main ullekh he ki, prithviraj chouhan chhaon bhashaa main nipun the 
 In addition to the six languages, Prithviraj also gained knowledge of epics, Vedanta, mathematics, mythology, history, military science and medicine
 vah sangit kala or chitra kala main bhi praveen the 
 Prithviraj Raso Kavya mentions that, in archery, the accomplished Prithviraj was also able to wield the elusive arrow

 1235 vikram sanvatsar caitra maas kii shukla chaturthi, tadnusaar 14 march 1179 ko wo shilaalekh prasthaapit hua tha
 After the demise of Someshwar, Prithviraj was crowned
 prithviraj raso kavy main ullekh he ki, In the auspicious time, Prithviraj ascended the golden throne
 brahmanon ne vedamantra gaan ke saath unka rajtilak kiya
 The glory of Prasad on the occasion of the coronation of Prithviraj was delightful

 On Shobha Yatra, city people wreathed flowers on the elephant mounted on Prithviraj

 Prithviraj Raso Kavya mentions that, when Prithviraj was eleven years old, he was first married
 uske pashchaat prativarsh unka ek ek vivaah huta gaya, jab tak prithviraj baees varshiya na hue
 After that, when Prithviraj was thirty-six years old, he had his last marriage with Sanyogita

 According to him, there was a small village of Dahiya Rajputs in such a part of Chauhansamraj

 She was keen to marry him

 Once she was going to Ajayameru Nagar to meet Prithviraj with her guards

 She became sad after seeing that demolished village

 The name of that village was Ajiyapur

 They took Ajia to their capital

 In the Prithviraj Raso Kavya, a poem called 'padmavatisamay' is also available
 rasokavy ke anusaar purv disha main samudrashikh naamak pradesh tha
 There Yadav dynasty was ruled by a king named Vijayapala
 uski patni kaa naam padmasen tha
 The daughter of both of them was Padmavati
 padmavati ek din rajbhavan ke udyaan main vicharan kar rahi thi
 At that time a shook was seen by him
 vah shuk atyant aakarshak tha
 The Shuk also considered Padmavati's blood balance as a bimble fruit and proceeded to eat it
 usee samay padmavati ne shuk ko apane haath main grahan kiya
 He was a scholar of human language
 vah padmavati kaa manoranjan karne ke liye anek katha sunaata rahaa
 After that, Padmavati curiously asked Shuk, "O Shukraj, where do you live? Who is the king of your kingdom?" Then Shuk began to describe his kingdom and Prithviraj in detail to eradicate the curiosity of Padmavati

 He was born to kill the wicked in Kali Yuga

 On hearing the praise of Prithviraj from the mouth of Shuk, Yadav Kumari Padmavati's mind became attached to Prithviraj
 parantu yauvan praapt padmavati kaa vivaah vijaypal ne kumudmani ke saath nirdhaarit kar diya tha
 Kumudamani was the king of the Kumaon region
 samudrashikhar pradesh main rajkumaari kaa vivaah kii sajjataa ho rahi thi
 Padmavati was distraught after hearing the news of her marriage on the other side
 uske pashchaat vah shuk ko boli, "he kir ! shuk ! aap sheeghra hi dehali jaakar mere priy prithviraj ko yahan bula laaie"
 After that Padmavati gave a letter to Shuk
 he kshatriya kulbhushan ! main tan man se aapako prem karti hoon
 If you consider me and my family to be worthy, protect me and take my life
 1130 shaksanvatsar ke baishakhmas kii shukladvadashi tithi ko meraa vivaah nishchit he
 Therefore, before coming and destroying Rukmini, please gratify me by killing me
 --- padmavati Shuk went to Delhi by air and gave a letter to Prithviraj
 patr padhakar prithviraj ne samanton ke saath samudrashikhar nagar kii ore yatra prarambh kii
 On the other side, Kumudamani started the procession from Kumaon
 prithviraj samudrashikhar ja rahaa hai ye samachar praapt karke mohammad ghori ne bhi samudrashikhar kii ore yatra aarambh kii
 After that, Padmavati became very distraught after hearing the news of Kumudamani's arrival at sea
 kyonki prithviraj ke aagaman kaa samachar use nahin mila tha
 So she was crying while waiting on the passage of the Prada, looking at the road with a feverish heart
 usee samay shuk aakar use bolaa, "he sundari ! tere priyatam sameep ke shiv mandir main hai
 You soon there "
 shuk kaa vachan sun kar punerjeevan praapt padmavati ke netre achaanak chamak uththe
 After wearing a new cloth, bathing with fragrant water, wearing a shodash, she went to the pagoda with a lamp in a golden place with her sakhi
 shivalay pahunch kar shiv parvati kii puja karke prithviraj kii ore gai
 After that, after removing her mouthpiece, she became enchanted and looked at the beauty of Prithviraj
 prithviraj bhi thodaa aage jaakar padmavati ke sameep khadey ho gayi
 Seeing that view of the temple, the verdicts of Padmavati were surprised and seeing Padmavati and Prithviraj
 kyonki padmavati or prithviraj ke pranay ke vishay main shuk ko chhod kar koi bhi nahin jaanata tha
 After that, Prithviraj wrote the hand of Padmavati in his hand and performed the ashes
 dehali kii ore prithviraj or padmavati kii yatra kaa armbh hote hi samudrashikharnagar main sarvatra padmavatiharan kaa samachar vyaapt ho gaya
 Vijayapala and Kumudamani went after Prithviraj to fight with Prithviraj
 vijaypal or kumdamani ke aagaman kaa samachar sun kar prithviraj sasamant yuddh ke liye sajj ho gaye
 After that, the victorious Prithviraj started the journey towards Dehli in a destructive war
 parantu maarg main mohammad ghori ne apane sainikon ke saath prithviraj ke upar akraman kar diya
 But Ghori's army was severely defeated
 uske sabhi sainik yahan vahaan palaayan kar rahe the or prithviraj ne ghori ko bandi bana kar dehali kii ore prayaag kiya
 Upon reaching Dehli, Prithviraj got married to Padmavati in auspicious time in the temple of Durga
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, saahitiyik drushti se ukt katha kaa mahatva he, parantu aitihaasik drushti se ukt katha kaa mahatva nahin he
 Because nowhere in history is the mention of the fort called Samudrashikar and its king Vijayapala obtainable
 donon naam kaalpanik hai
 Historians are of the opinion that this legend will be a famous story from the Puranas, which, unknown to me, will be projected by an unknown person in Prithviraj Raso Kavya

 Along with the village, he also donated huge forest on the Choro side of the village

 But the princess of Chandrapundir region was married to Prithviraj
 prithviraj vijay mahakavy main tilottama naam se, prithviraj raso kavy main sanyogita naam se, surajan charit mahakavy main 'kantimati' naam se sanyogita kaa ullekh miltaa he
 Sanyogita is not mentioned in the Rambhamanjari epic and in the Hammir epic
 sanyogita kaa haran itihaas kii mahatvapurn ghatana thi
 At that time Prithviraj's bravery was being praised in all directions
 ek baar sanyogita ne prithviraj kii veerta kaa or soundarya kaa varnan suna
 After that she started loving them
 duusari ore sanyogita ke pita jayachand ne sanyogita kaa vivaah swayamvar madhyam se karne kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Jaichand conducted the Ashwamedha Yajna
 us yajna kii parisamapti par sanyogita ke swayamvar kaa muhoort tha
 Jaichand desired Ashwamedhayagya to self-respect India
 parantu prithviraj ne uskaa virodh kiya tha
 Hence Jayachand did not invite Prithviraj to the Swayamvara and installed the statue of Prithviraj in place of the gatekeeper
 duusari ore jab sanyogita ne janaa ki, prithviraj swayamvar main anupasthit rahenge, to usne prithviraj ko bulaane ke liye doot bheja
 Knowing that Sanyogita loves me, Prithviraj departed towards Kannauj city
 ashwamedhyagy ke pashchaat swayamvarkaal main jab sanyogita haath main varmala liye upasthit raajaaon ko dekh rahi thi, tab dwaar par sthit prithviraj kii murti ko usne dekha
 Sanyogita went near the idol and put it in the gorge of the idol of Varmala Prithviraj
 usee kshan prasaad main ashwaruji prithviraj pravisht hue
 He challenged all the kings for war with Sinharanad
 use pashchaat sanyogita ko le kar indrapastha prasthaan kar gayi
 After defeating Jayachanda on the way, Muhammad Ghori was imprisoned and Prithviraj reached Indrapastha with Sanyogita
 jayachand to apane apmaan ke pratishodh kaa vairoddhar karne ke liye prithviraj ke saath yuddh kiya
 But when Muhammad Ghori realized that Prithviraj was going towards Kannauj city, he had blocked the way to defeat Prithviraj
 prithviraj ne na keval mohammad ghori ko parajeet kiya, api tu us ko bandi bana kar indraprastha bhi le gayi
 When Prithviraj ascended the throne of Shakambhari, the Chauhan dynasty walked with the help of the generals of the empire
 saamantiya shashan pranali main sabhi samant swatantra se apane rajkosh kaa vyavasthaapan karte hai or vaarshik uphaar ke rup main apane samraat ko niyat dhanrashi pradaan karte hai
 During the war period, the feudal lords send their army according to the command of the emperor
 saamantiya shashan pranali main rajnatik ekta kii sthiti ati shithila hoti he
 Because soldiers who are engaged in war by the order of the emperor, they have loyalty to their king and not to their emperor
 samanton kii bhi apni mahechhaayen hoti hai
 Therefore, they are constantly trying to expand their sphere of influence
 jab samanton kaa samrat kisi yuddh main parrast hota he, maranasann hota he yaa nirbal hota he, tab samant apni swatantrata ke liye praytn armbh kar dete hai
 Knowing the reason for the emancipation of the emperor, he is also ready to attack his emperor
 rajsinghaasana par arurh prithviraj yuva the, atah anek samanton ne apni swatantrata ke swapn dekh kar yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar di
 But with the help of Camas and Bhunacamall, Karporadevi suppressed those rebellious feudatories
 tatah vigraharaj ke dwitiya putr nagarjun ne ajayameru rajya ke uttaradhikari ke rup main vidroh kar diya
 When Prithviraj was ruling, Nagarjuna was living in exile in Yoginipur
 us samay yoginipur main nagarjun ke maatul tomaravansheey prithvipal kaa shashan tha
 The Tomar dynasty king Prithvipal was also a feudal of the Chauhan dynasty
 prithviraj vijay mahakavy ke dasham sarg ke shashtham or saptam shloke main ullekh he ki, bhaagyashaalee, balashaali vigraharaj kaa vivekshunya putr nagarjun ne gujpur ke upar akraman kiya tha
 The Tomar dynasty king Prithvipal did not have enough military power to attack Prithviraj
 parantu prithvipal kaa samarthan anya yadavavanshi bhadanak naamak samant ne bhi kiya
 Nevertheless, the combined army of both of them was also unable to face Prithviraj's 70,000 cavalry soldiers, Gajasainika and the officials
 harihar nivas dvivedi kaa mat he ki, sapadalaksh samraj kaa poorviy prativeshi rajya jejakabhukti or kanyakubj rajya ne bhi prithviraj ke viruddh yuddh karne ke liye prithvipal ko sainya sahaayta pradaan kii thi
 The statement of the Chauhan dynasty of Shakambhari was fought for the first time with the Yadav dynasties during the time of Ajayraj
 bijauliya ke shilaalekh main pandrahaven shloke main ullekh praapt hota he ki, shrimarg kaa or durdd pradesh ke abhiyaan kaal main chachig, singhul, or yashodhar ityadi veeron kaa vadh ajayraj ne kiya tha
 After that, Arnoraj and Vigraharaj also made statements with regional Yadav dynasties
 parantu ve sab yadavon ko samul nasht karne main safal na hue
 Immediately Nagarjuna revolted against Prithviraj, the then imperial territorial king Sohanpal Chauhan was adorned to fight against the dynasty
 atah usne apane sanybal se nagarjun kii sahaayta kii
 Vigharaj fought with Sohanpal's ancestor Kumarapala
 anuvanshik yuddh kii sthiti prithviraj ke shasankaal main api samudbhoot hui
 But Prithviraj destroyed the Yadav dynasties of the Bhadanak region
 bhadanak pradesh ke upari akraman karne se prak prithviraj ne apni shashan vyavastha main do mahatvapurn parivartan kiye the
 First, he removed the feudal lord of Hansipur and appointed his brother Hariraj as the feudatory of Hansidurg
 dwitiya kaary main unhone yoginipur main prithvipal ke riktasthaan main govind ko niyukt kiya
 And by making adequate defense arrangements of the main two centers of war, Prithviraj became adorned to answer the conspiracy of his opponents
 khartargachhpattavali ke 14 prishth par soochna prapya he ki, prithviraj ne digvijay abhiyaan ke liye narin pradesh main se prasiddh he

 Camas and Skanda were prominent among Prithviraj's commanders

 The soldiers, who were alive, brought the Chambal river twenty-two kilometers from the town after Shikoha

 During the war, Chambalnadi started flowing in the Yamunanadi and Southeast direction in the east of the Sapalaksha Empire

 Hey Prithviraj! In what words can you describe your might and fame? Whose army pleased Vijayadevi from all directions
 jisane arne bhujabal se virodhiyon kii hastisena par aadhipaty sthapit kiya wo swastik chihn se yukt ho
 There are also names like Chedishesh, Darshana, Juzhoti, Kuntalesh etc
 of Jejak Bhakti
 sadyah jejakabhukti pradesh ko bundelkhand ke room main janaa jaataa he
 Although the vast territory of Bundelkhand has been divided between Madhya Pradesh and the state of Uttar Pradesh, yet that state is famous by the name Bundelkhand
 us bundelkhand main jejakabhukti naamak swatantra rajya tha
 Yamunanadi in north border of Jejak Bhakti region, Chambalanadi flowed in northwest direction
 dakshinpurv disha kii seemaa main bundelkhand kaa parvatiyasthal tha
 The cultural capital of Jejak Bhakti was Khajuraho
 jejajabhukti pradesh ke do samrik kendra the
 Firstly, the main capital, Kalinjar-nagar and the second Mahobagarh-nagar
 jejakabhukti rajya kaa nirmaan ati vicitra tha
 There were small forts everywhere
 un main kalinger, ajaigarh, bairigarh, mahoba, madpha ityadi mahatvapurn durg the
 In the year 1182, Prithviraj attacked Jejakabhukti
 prithviraj ke akraman se chakit shatru yuddh main parajeet hue
 a commander named Salkhan was appointed in Sirsadurga on the banks of Pahujanadi
 kaimash ne uskaa vadh kiya
 a brother named Malkhan of Salkhan was also killed by Kaimash
 sirsadurg jit kar yada prithviraj kii sena aakori naamak sthaan kii ore agressor thi, tabamaarg main hi chandrerisena ke saath bhayankar yuddh hua
 The warrior of Alma named Paramardidev was defeated in that battle
 atah usne van main sharan lee
 a warrior named Brahmajit was killed in that war
 uske pashchaat prithviraj ke akraman se paramardidev ke prasiddh senapati hutatma hua
 Paramardeva himself became disenchanted with the Chandel war and began to go undercover in Kalanjirdurg
 parantu prithviraj ne kaalanzirdurg par chaaron disha se akraman kar ke paramardidev ko aatmasamarpan ke liye vivash kiya
 When Prithviraj was with his army at Shibir in Madanpur, located near the place called Aeran in Malvapradesh, he got the news of Paramardev's surrender
 merutung ke prabandhchintaman main ullekh prapya he ki, "paramardidev ne apane mukh main trin sthapit kariya arthath, atyantadinta ko pradarshit kar prithviraj se jeevanabhiksha praapt kar gaya" 
 Prithviraj's inscriptions support Jejakabhuktivijaya also
 stambhah shambhunitambanipranatishu vyagro na dhaaturgrihe
asmakan paramardanosti vadane nyasten sangrakshitah
 Earth Verse 8, Part 1, Shargadharpaddhati: arthath shiv kii puja main mand he, krishnarchan main trishna nahin, durgako pranaam na kar stabdh khada he or vidhaataa rupi grah vyagr jiskaa aisa hamaara swami paramardidev trin mukh main santhaapit kar narpathi prithviraj se jeevandaan paane main safal hue
 Prithviraj's campaign of Jejak bhakti pradesh was successful
 parantu vah abhiyaan apurna hi tha
 Because Jejakabhukti was the mother of the native king of Chalukyasamrat, Naikidevi, the daughter of Parmardev, the queen of the country
 naikidevi kushalrajnneetigya api thi
 Therefore, knowing the state of his father's defeat, he invaded the Ajayameru kingdom to distract Prithviraj
 kootneet main prauji vah apane abhiyaan main safal api hui
 As Prithviraj heard the news of the invasion of the Ajmeru kingdom, he went to Ajayameru region, postponing the expedition to other regions of Jejakabhuktipradesh
 prithviraj raso kavy main ullekh he ki, yuddh main parajeet paramardidev ne dehtyag kiya
 But the last inscription of Paramardidev written in 1201 years is found
 atah us varsh tak to uske jeevanghatana kii pushti hoti he
 During the reign of Prithviraj's father Someshwar, Someshwar suffered from the Chalukyan dynasty Ajaypal
 prithviraj kii sena ne ratrikaal main hi abu pradesh par akraman kar diya
 But Prithviraj was not leading that campaign
 kyonki prithviraj to digvijay abhiyaan ke liye bhandanakpradesh or jejakabhuktipradesh main the
 An inscription written in 1239 Vikram Samvatsar obtained from Madanpur confirms this
 khartargachhpattavali ke anusaar prithviraj dwaara 1239 vikram sanvatsar main digvijayabhiyaan armbh karne ke liye narineshetra main apni sena ekatra kii thi
 Prithviraj was in the Vijayabhayana of Jedak Bhaktipradesh, when the Chalukyan dynasty Bhimdevdiyya invaded the Ajmeru kingdom to distract Prithviraj
 us akraman main bhimdev dwitiya dwaara sapadalaksh samrajya ke laghu bhubhag par aadhipaty sthapit kiya gaya tha
 That campaign of the Chalukyas was led by an officer named Jagaddeva
 parantu wo safalataa ati swalpakalin thi
 Two inscriptions were found from Charalugram, 22 km from Chhapar village, located at Agnekon in Bikaner city, in which those inscriptions give details of the Nagaur war
 un main ankit sanvatsar 1241 vikram sanvatsar he
 In the Tatra Nagaur Sangram, the souvenirs of those who received Veergati have been established
 khartargachhpattavali ke jaise tatraapi chouhan or chalukyavansh ke sandhi kaa ullekh miltaa he
 It is clear from the basis of the above facts that Jagaddev and Dharavarsha, the two commanders of the Chalukyas, got military success against the Chauhan dynasty in the early period and they were also successful in gaining the suzerainty over the kingdom of Sapadalaksha
 parantu uske pashchaat chouhan vansh ke saath hue dirghakaalin yuddh se sandhi kii sthiti samudbhoot hui
 It is mentioned in the Khartargachhapattavali, that Senapati Jagaddev was devastated by the long war with Prithviraj
 atah usne prithviraj ke saath sandhi kar lee thi
 In any way Jagaddev wanted a treaty with Prithviraj
 jagaddev kii sandhi se sambaddhit vivashtaa khartargachhpattavali main varnit ek ghatan se bahudhaa gyaat ho sakati he
 On page 43 of the Khartargachhapattavali, it is said that in 1244 Vikram Samvatsar, some of the nobles of Sapradalakasamrajya went to the state of Gujarat
 tambhayad naamak dandanayak ne unako lutane kii yojana banaai
 He also decorated his team for looting
 parantu itane mahatkaarya ko karne ke liye pradhanmantri kii anumati aavashyak he ye soch kar usne jagaddev ko patr likhaa
 Right now, a congregation of rich leaders of the kingdom of Sapadalaksha has come
 aapaki ajna se main unako lut kar dhan kii vyavastha kar saktaa hum? On reading this, Jagaddev became angry with anger
 unhone pratyuttar likhaa ki, i have just been able to make a treaty with Prithviraj with much difficulty
 atah main tumko chetavanee detaa hoon ki, yadi tune sapadalaksh ke kisi bhi jan ko peeda di,tarhi main tumhen gadhe ke pet main silava duungaa
 After reading the above letter, Dandanayak sent them well after receiving the best hospitality
 khartargachhpattavali ke is kathan kii pushti verawalprashasti bhi karata he
 In Jejakabhukti Pradesh, Prithviraj conquered, Ajayameru kingdom was invaded by the Chalukyan dynasty king Bhimdeva by order of Naikidevi
 atah prithviraj jejakabhuktipradesh ke anypradesh kaa vijayabhiyaan sthagit kar chalukyavanshiyon ke saath yuddh karne gayi the
 Prithviraj and Bhimdev fought for a long time
 1244 vikram sanvatsar main prithviraj kii vijay ke saath us yuddh kaa ant ho gaya
 The account of the Kharatagargachhapattavali, inscriptions from Jaisalmer, Nagaur, Badmer and Jodhpur and the Veravalprashsti give sufficient notice of the war results between Prithviraj and Bhimdev
 prithviraj raso kavy main ullekh he ki, prithviraj ne bhimdev dwitiya ko maar daalaa tha
 But even though Prithviraj died in the year 1192, the position of Bhimvedava II was till 1238, it is proved by the evidence
 mohammad ghori i
 1175 varsh main multan pradesh par aadhipaty prasthaapit kar usee varsh uchh pradesh par chal se aadhipaty sthapit kar chukaa tha
 After that, in 1182 AD, invading the southern Sindh region, he invariably established independence over Indus
 us se sapadalakshasamrajya kii or ghori dwaara shasit sandhupradesh kii seemaa samaan ho gai
 And Ghori became the ambassador and enemy of Prithviraj
 un donon ke paas shatruta ke apane kaaran bha the
 Prithviraj wanted to protect his territory, but it was necessary for him to repel the invaders of Turk
 duusari ore ghori kii vistaarvaadi niti ke maarg main prithviraj kantak samaan the
 Because the end of Prithviraj was the goal of Ghori to expand the territory of India
 prithvirajvijay main ullekh miltaa he ki, pashchimottar disha main jo ashwon ke liye prasiddh pradesh hai, us pradesh kaa gaumansabhakshi mlechh ghori naamak raja garjan desh main nivas karata he
 Hearing about that cowboy eater, Prithviraj pledged to destroy the mlechha
 prithviraj dwaara mlechhanaash kii jo pratigya kii gai thi, uske vishay main ghori bhi jaanata thaa
 Therefore, in the year 1177 AD, he sent his envoy to Ajayameru fort
 uske pashchaat ajayameru kii rajyasabha main takla doot upasthit hua
 While that messenger was present in Ajmeruprasad, then Nagarjunadaman festival was going on in Prasadad
 vidhaataa dwaara kapilavadh kii prashasti likhane ke liye hi uske lalaat kii rachana kii he ityadi vaakyon se us doot ke sapaat takley kaa uphaas prithviraj vijay mahakavy main praapt hota he
 It is further mentioned in Prithvirajvijay that the hair of his beard, the bruises and the hair of the eyelid were white in color in his region
 uske murdhanyavarna nasht ho chuke the
 That is, he was unable to pronounce the idols
 atah uski bhashaa pakshaon ke kalravawat pratibhashit ho rahaa tha
 His skin was looking leprosy
 usne krishnavarna kaa vicitra vastra dhaaran kiya tha
 After this, some verses are not received in Prithvirajavijaya epic
 atah doot kii ajayameru ke prasaad main upasthit kaa prayojan nischitatya gyaat nahin hota
 But upon hearing the words of the messenger, Prithviraj responded at once, those verses are available
 doot ke vachan sunakar prithviraj kii bheeshan pratikriya thi
 Prithviraj exclaimed in a high voice with great anger, "what shall i say to him? He knows with certainty that i have started the Vijayabhiyaan only to kill a cannibal like him
" ye jaanakar bhi wo mujhe, jise log "ajayameru kaa singh" aisa sambodhit karte hai, usko doot bhejtaa he"
 From the said wrathful words of Prithviraj, one can only guess the message of Ghori
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, us kaal main jaisi rajnatik sthiti thi, uske anugun to ghori ne prithviraj ko aatmasamarpan ke liye athwa sandhi ke liye sandesh bheja hoga
 Hearing the full offer from Ghori's tail, Prithviraj would have rejected that proposal, because the Chauhan dynasty and Prithviraj would have opposite messages from the self-respect
 prithviraj ke sapadalakshasamrajya kii seemaa kaa or sindhupradesh kii seemaa ke parivartit rajnatik sameekaran ke saath saath vikampur kaa bhi rajnatik mahatva batch gaya tha
 Because along the border of Vikkampur, the border of the Indus and Sapalaksha regions was included
 is prakaar vikampradesh kaa pashchimbhag sindhupradesh kii or purvabhag sapadalakshapradesh kii seemaa ko sparsh karne laga
 At that time, the Lokra dynasty was ruled by Vikrampur
 ukt rajnatik sameekaran main rashtrahit kii bali dekar lodrava vansheey raja jaisal ne raja ghori kii sahaayta kii
 Because with the support of Ghori, the Lodravana dynasty was ruled
 ghori ke saath prithviraj ke kitne yuddh hue, is vishay par vivaad he
 Because different historical figures are given in different historical literature
 parantu sarvatra un donon ke bheeshan yuddh kaa varnan uplabdh hota he
 The first war of Narayan and the second war of Narayan are famous
 pratham yuddh i
 1191 varsh main or dwitiya yuddh i
 1992 varsh main hua tha
 Prithviraj was defeated in the first war and Prithviraj was defeated in the second
 prithviraj raso kavy main ullikhit he ki, prithviraj ne teen baar ghori ko parjit kar dandit kiya tha
 Prithviraj had arrested Ghori seven times, this is found in Hammiramahakaavya
 prabandhkosh main varnit he ki, prithviraj ne bees baar ghori ko bandi kar chhod diya tha
 According to the Surjancharitamahakavya, Prithviraj punished Ghori twenty-one times
 prabandhchintamani granth ke anusaar taees baar prithviraj ne ghori ko jivit chhod diya
 The evidence of Prithviraj's war with Ghori is unavailable
 atah nishchit sankhya ke vishay main vivaad yathavat he
 But historians believe that Prithviraj and Ghori suffered numerous friction between them
