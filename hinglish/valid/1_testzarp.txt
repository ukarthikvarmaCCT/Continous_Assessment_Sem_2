 shriimatii= glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa= with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii= great, city; dasha cha dve= ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani= yojana-s; aayataa= lengthy; triini vistiirnaa= three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
 More info on these measures can be had from The Artha Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin

 a child who cannot see the letters of his book can be said to be suffering from this condition
 drishtiheenta bhi isi kaa naam he
 From the inability to perceive light, the inability to do such things which cannot be done without seeing, is called blindness
 is dasha ke nimnlikhit vishesh kaaran hote hai: In northern parts of India, where there is a lot of Rohe due to excess of dust, the disease is found more
 deshavaasiyon kii aarthik dasha bhi, bahut badi seemaa tak, is rog ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Inadequate and adequate food causes diseases in the eyes, which results in blindness
 yah rog ati pracheen kaal se andhata kaa vishesh kaaran rahaa he
 This cause of blindness is found in 33 percent of blind patients coming in the eye departments of hospitals of our country
 yah rog uttar pradesh, punjab, bihar tathaa bengal main adhik hota he
 This disease is especially prevalent among children going to school in villages and earlier
 iskaa prarambh bachapan se bhi ho jaataa he
 Unhealthy dirty conditions of living of poor persons are particularly helpful in causing disease
 is rog ke updrav rup main carnia main vran ho jaataa he jo uchit chikitsa na hone par vidaar utpann kar detaa he, jisase aage chalakar andhata ho sakati he
 The cause of this disease is a virus that has been isolated from the roasts
 rohe palkon ke bhitari prishthon par ho jate hai
 Each roha is red, shining, like a raised grain, but is gray or white in color when it becomes old
 ye gol yaa chapate or chote bade kai prakaar ke hote hai
 They do not have any order
 inase panes utpann hokar carnia ke madhya kii ore failte hai
 The reason for this is the spread of disease-producing viruses
 yah dasha praayah carnia ke upree ardhbhag main adhik utpann hoti he
 Itching and burning within the eyelids, watery discharge from the eyes, lightness and pain are common symptoms
 sambhav he, aarambh main koi bhi lakshan na ho, kintu kuch samay pashchaat uparyukt lakshan utpann ho jate hai
 The eyelids become thick
 palkon ko ulatakar dekhne se un par rohe dikhaai dete hai
 There are four stages of this disease
 pehali avasthaa main shleshmik kala ek samaan shothyukt or laal makhmal ke samaan dikhaai padati he; duusari avasthaa main rohe ban jate hai
 In the third stage, the sprouts of the rohs continue to grow and in their place, there is a shrinkage in the art by making sautric metal
 chauthi or antim avasthaa main updrav utpann ho jate hai, jinka kaaran carnia main virus kaa prasar or palkon kii kala kaa sikud janaa hota he
 The penetration of infection from other diseases is very simple and often occurs always
 in rogon ke parinamswaroop shleshmakala, carnia tathaa palkon main nimnlikhit dashaayen utpann ho jaati hai: The infection of Rohe reaches a healthy child with a finger, or towel, handkerchief, etc
 from a diseased child or person and makes him sick
 aswatchta, aswasth paristhitiyaan tathaa balvardhak bhojan ke abhaav se rogotpatti main sahaayta milti he
 Dust is considered a special aid in spreading disease
 is kaaran gaanvon main yah rog adhik hota he
 Lack of appropriate treatment is responsible for the terrible consequences of the disease
 aushadhiyon or shastrkarm donon prakaar se chikitsa kii jaati he
 These are the main among the medicines: - To eat 6 to 8 tablets of sulfonamide per day
 pratijivi aushadhiyon kaa netra main prayog, netra main daalane ke liye boondon ke rup main tathaa lagane ke liye maraham ke rup main, jisaki kriya adhik samay tak hoti rahati he
 Penicillin has no benefit in this disease; Yes, other infections do destroy it
 is rog ke liye oromycin, terra mycin, chlormycitin aadi kaa bahut prayog hota he
 In our experience, using both sulfacetimide and neomycin combined results in satisfactory results
 ymide-mycitin ko, jo in donon kaa yoga he, din main chaar baar, chah se aath saptaah tak, lagaana chahie
 Also, drops of boric acid, zinc and adrenaline solution should be put in the eye
 yadi carnia kaa vran bhi ho to inke saath atropine kii boonden bhi din main do baar daalana or boric ghol se netra ko dhonaa tathaa ushm senk karnaa uchit he
 Arms treatment is to be done only when the above treatment is not beneficial
 shleshmakala ko enithene se chetanahin karke prayek rohe kii ek chimati se dabaakar phoda jaataa he
 This method has been used for a long time and it is also useful
 shleshmakala kaa chhedan keval dirghakaalin rog main kabhi kabhi kiya jaataa he
 Entropion, ectropion and leukoplakia of cornea are also treated by arms
 shwetank jab madhyasth yaa itnaa vistrut hota he ki uske kaaran drushti ruk jaati he to carnia main ek ore chhedan karke usamen se yris ke bhaag ko baahar khinchakar kaat diya jaataa he, jisase prakaash ke bheetar jane kaa maarg ban jaataa he
 This function is called optical iridectomy
 panes ke liye vitamin-bi2 10 milligram, antahpeshiy maarg se chah yaa saat din tak nity pratidin dena chahie
 It is necessary to keep the eye clean by bleaching
 is rog kaa kaaran yah he ki janm ke avasar par mata ke sankramit janan maarg dwaara shishu kaa sir nikalate samay uske netron main sankraman pahunch jaataa he or tab jeevanu shleshmakala main shoth utpann kar dete hai
 Due to this disease, a large number of our countrymen lose their hands for a lifetime
 yah anumaan lagaaya gaya he ki 30 pratishat vyaktiyon main gonocokkas, 30 pratishat main staphilo yaa stryptocokkas or shesh main basilas tathaa virus ke sankraman se rog utpann hota he
 In the last ten years, the disease has reduced due to the use of penicillin and sulfonamide
 janm ke teen din ke bheetar netra sooj jate hai or palkon ke bich se shwet matamaile rang kaa gadha srav nikalne lagata he
 If this secretion comes out after the fourth day, then it should be understood that the infection has occurred after birth
 palkon ke bheetar kii ore se hone vaale srav kii ek buund shuddh kii hui kaanch kii shalaka se lekar kaanch kii slide par failaakar ranjit karne ke pashchaat sookshmdarshi dwaara uski pariksha karwaani chahie
 But it is not appropriate to stop the therapy until the results of the examination are known
 chikitsa turant prarambh kar deni chahie
 To prevent the disease, after birth, clean the eyes with boric lotion and apply a CC of penicillin in them
 In the solution, drops of solution of 2,500 units are added
 yah chikitsa itani safal hui he ki silver nitrate kaa do pratishat ghol daalane kii puraani pratha ab bilkul uth gai he
 The action of penicillin is also faster than sulfonamide
 chikitsa bhi penicillin se hi kii jaati he
 Drops of the above mentioned power solution of penicillin are injected into the eyes every four or five minutes until the secretion stops
 ek se teen ghante main srav band ho jaataa he
 The second method is to add drops for 15 minutes at one minute and then for two minutes, then the discharge stops in half an hour
 phir do teen dinon tak adhik antar se boonden daalate rahete hai
 If ulcers occur in the cornea, then use of atropine is also necessary
 is rog main carnia par chechak ke dane ubhar aate hai, jisase vahaan vran ban jaataa he
 Then they erupt, causing a number of disturbances
 inkaa parinaam andhata hoti he
 Vaccinating smallpox twice is often the surest way to avoid disease
 kitni hi chikitsa kii jaae, itnaa laabh nahin ho saktaa
 The disease arises from vitamin a deficiency
 is kaaran nirdhan or asvachh vaataavaran main rahane vaale vyaktiyon ko yah adhik hota he
 This disease is also a special cause of blindness in our country
 yah rog bacchon ko pratham do varshon tak adhik hota he
 The mucosa of the eye becomes dry
 donon palkon ke bich kaa bhaag dhundla sa ho jaataa he or us par shwet rang ke dhabbe ban jate hai jinhen bitut ke dhabbe kehete hai
 There is a ulcer in the cornea, which later turns into Vidar
 in updravon ke kaaran baccha andhaa ho jaat he
 Such children are often not well maintained, due to which they also fall prey to other diseases and end their lives in large numbers very soon
 netra main vitamin e yaa peroline daalkar shleshmika ko snigdh rakhana chahie
 In the cornea, it is necessary to add atropine when a ulcer occurs
 rogi ko saadhaaran chikitsa atyant aavashyak he
 Its main therapy is to give a patient a quantity of vitamin a in milk, butter, fruits, shark-liver or cod-liver oil and to inject 50,000 units of vitamin a into the body every day or every other day by injection in acute stages of the disease
 is
 rog ke aarambh main hi yadi purna chikitsa prarambh kar di jaae to rogi ke rogamukt hone kii atyadhik sambhaavna rahati he
 In our country leprosy is more prevalent in Uttar Pradesh, Bengal and Madras and till now it was also a special cause of blindness
 kintu idhar sarkaar dwaara rog ke nidaan or chikitsa ke vishesh aayojanon ke kaaran is rog main ab bahut kami ho gai he or is prakaar kusht ke kaaran hue andhe vyaktiyon kii sankhya ghat gai he
 There are two types of leprosy
 ek vah jisamen tantrikas aakraant hoti hai
 The second one in which gullets or small knots are formed under the skin
 donon prakaar kaa rog andhaka utpann kar saktaa he
 In the first type of disease, due to occlusion of the seventh or ninth pulse, the muscles of the upper eyelid are destroyed and the eyelid does not stop
 isse shleshmika tathaa carnia kaa shoth utpann hota he, phir vran banate hai
 His infestation leads to blindness
 duusare prakaar ke rog main shleshmika or shwetpatal main shoth ke lakshan dikhaai dete hai
 The hair of the brow falls and the knots become like it
 carnia par shwet chooney ke samaan bindu dikhaai dene lagate hai
 Panus can also be formed
 carnia main bhi shoth ho jaataa he or yris bhi aakraant ho jaataa he 
 Due to this, he gets connected to his front and back components
 kusht ke liye salphone samooh kii vishisht aushadhiyaan hai
 For the treatment of physical diseases, it is necessary to give them in full quantity
 saath hi netra rog kii sthanik chikitsa bhi aavashyak he
 It is extremely important to use atropone drops or ointment wherever there are cornea or iris infestation
 aavashyak hone par shastrkarm bhi karnaa padataa he
 Due to this disease many types of disturbances arise in the eyes, which results in blindness
 nimnlikhit mukhya dashaayen hai:- A
 Intestinal keratitis, kha
 sclirojing kiratitis, C
 Iritis and aerodocyclitis, gha
 siphilitic coroiditis, E
 Syphilitic retinitis, c
 drushti tantrika kii syphilis
 This condition can take the following forms: - siphilis kii saadhaaran chikitsa vishesh mahatv kii he
 Penicillin has been proven to be particularly useful for this
 antarpeshiy injection dwaara 10 lakh ekak prati din 10 din tak di jaati he
 Thereafter, weekly intravenous injection of Arsenic's yoga for eight weeks and between then weekly intravenous injection of bismuth-sodium-tartrate
 garam bhiige kapade se senk; Cartesone, one 100 drops or 10 mg of cartison, injected under the mucosa; atropine, 10 pratishat kii boonden netra main daalana
 It is commonly known as beriberi in public
 san 1930 main yah rog mahamari ke rup main bengal main failaa tha or balak, yuva, vruddh, stri, purush, sabko samaan rup se hua tha
 This disease was a particular nuisance
 is rog main netra ke bheetar daav, bad jaati he or drushti kshetra ksheen hota jaataa he, yahan tak ki kuch samay main vah purnataya samaapt ho jaataa he or vyakti drishtiheen ho jaataa he
 In the end, vision and pulse also decay
 baahar se dekhne main netra saamaanya prakaar ke dikhaai padate hai, kintu vyakti ko kuch bhi dikhaai nahin padataa
 In the event of disease, a small hole is made at the confluence of the cornea and sclera, in addition to the usual treatment of epidemiology, before the umbilical cord
 ise triphining kehete hai
 This keeps the fluid coming out of the anterior chamber of the eyeball and is absorbed by the whitetail
 is prakaar netra kii daab badhane nahin paati
 This is also a major cause of blindness
 is rog main netra ke bheetar kii daab bad jaati he or drushti kaa kshay ho jaataa he
 This disease is of two types, primary and secondary
 praathmik ko phir do prakaaron main baanta ja saktaa he, sambharani tathaa asambharani 
 Ailment type disease can start in a severe or chronic form
 iske vishesh lakshan netra main pidaa, laalimaa, jaleey srav, drushti kii kshinta, aankh ke purvakoshth kaa uthlaa ho janaa tathaa netra kii bhitari daab kaa badhanaa he
 Mostly, the patient consults the doctor only when acute pain and other symptoms are intensified
 yadi doctor netra rogon kaa visheshgy hota he to vah rog ko pahachaanakar uski upyukt chikitsa kaa aayojan karata he, jisase rogi andhaa nahin hone paata
 But due to the acute exacerbation of symptoms, the patient often does not show the doctor until the vision is produced, but there is no hope of beneficial therapy
 is prakaar ke rog ke akraman rah rahakar hote hai
 There are no symptoms of the disease in the intervening period
 keval purvakoshth kaa uthalaapan rah jaataa he jiskaa pataa rogi ko nahin chalata
 This often leads to confusion in the diagnosis of the disease
 bhram utpann karne vaala doosraa rog motiyobind he jo saadharantah adhik aayu main hota he
 Chronic primary ovulatory also occurs at this stage

 cardinal richalu france kaa dharmik netaa, samant tathaa rajanyik tha
 Richlu was an able politician who left an indelible mark on the history of Europe and due to this he has an honorable place in the field of diplomacy

 iskaa arth yah nahin he ki raja kamjor tha, jeri raja kamjor hota to vah samast darbar evam rajpariwaar ke virodh main cardinal kaa samarthan nahin kar paata
 Neither Richlu was famous nor did the king like him, yet on the strength of his ability, the king closed all his policies and supported him
 apane samast kaal main richalu ne do baton par atyadhik dhyaan diya
 First, the power of the king over the entire country should be made completely autocratic

 Thermodynamics is the electricity that begins to flow in the circuit of these wires on heating of two dissimilar metals
 is tathy ko sarvapratham sibek ne san 1821 main taanbe evam bismuth ke taron kii sandhi ko garm kar avishkrut kiya
 The electrical force produced in the above circuit is low and its intensity depends on the following things- vidyudvahak bal ko maapne ke liye asmaan dhaatuon ke taron ke thande sire vibhavamaapi se jod die jate hai
 If another metal wire is graded in the circuit, the thermal effects do not change
 yadi sibek vidyudvahak bal kaa pariman evam thandhi sandhi kaa tapantar or yadi ek sandhi kaa taap shunya degree celsius ho to e or t kaa sambandh nimnlikhit sutara main gyaat kiya jaataa he: Where a and b are thermodynamic constants and their value depends on the metal of the circuit wires
 dhaatuon ke tapavidyut sthiraank nimnlikhit sarini main die gaye he: The e = 45 t + 0
25T ^ 2 microvolt for the combination of bismuth and copper
 nunetaap par, kaa lagbhag samaanupati hota he, kintu yadi bahut adhik ho to kaa maan bad jaataa he
 The e = 158 t - 0
0285T2 microvolt of iron and copper bond is
 jab taap t = 275 celsisy ho, tab adhiktam e = 2,000 microvolt
 At high temperature the value of e starts decreasing and 5500 c degree it becomes zero 5500 C
 The direction of change is increased when the temperature increases, and the current starts flowing in the opposite direction
 is prakaar taap badhane par vidyut dhara kaa vipareet disha main pravaahit hona tapavidyutpravaah kaa utkraman kehalaata he or 550 degree celsius utkraman taap
 The treaty of copper and bismuth does not have this effect
 kinhin do taron kii sandhi kaa taap 10 celsius badhane par vidyut ke vidyudvahak bal main parivartan hota he, jise tapavidyut shakti kehete hai
 To compare the thermodynamic properties of different metals, one takes a wire of sis and another for a metal whose properties have to be determined
 tapavidyut prabhaav kaa adhik upyog taap maapne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The system of hot and frosty joint to measure the temperature is called temperature pair
 tanba or kanstaton yugma 500 celsius
 tak taap maapne ke liye tathaa platinum or rhodium evam platinum kii mishradhatu ke yugma 1500 degree celsius tak taap maapne ke achche yugma hai
 In 1834, Peltje discovered that when a current flows through a circuit of two dissimilar metals, one joint is heated and the other one is cold
 jab vidyut dhara lohe se taanbe kii or pravaahit hoti he to keshika nalee main tel kii ek buund bain ore chalakar taapan prabhaav dikhaati he or jab taanbe se lohe kii ore prabhavit hoti he tab shitalan prabhaav dikhaati he
 The Peltje effect is the reverse of the Seebeck effect
 san 1854 main wiliam tomson ne avishkrut kiya ki ek hi dhaatu ke taron ke donon siron ke madhya main vibhavantar hota he, yadi donon siron ke taap bhinn hon
 The Peltje and Thomson effects are of theoretical importance only
 inkaa vyaavhaarik mahatv kam he
 When a circuit consists of several thermodynamic pairs and their successive joints are alternately hot and cold, the total electronegative force is equal to the sum of the electronegative forces of all of the thermodynamic pairs in the circuit
 is tathy kaa upyog tapiya punj naamak upkaran main karte hai, jisamen bisamath or atimony ke chad shrenee main lage rahete hai
 This equipment uses radiation heat to estimate and detect
 is upkaran main jo vidyutdhara utpann hoti he use gailavanometer se maapte hai or yahi vikiran ke pariman kaa suchakank he
 Numerous attempts have been made to generate electricity by thermodynamic combinations in terms of commercial utility, but when these efforts were partially successful, it was found that their commercial value was negligible
 tapavidyut sangyojan dwaara vyapaarik drushti se vidyut utpann karne main do prakaar kii kathinaaiyaan hai: saidhantik env sanrachanaatmak
 To achieve sufficient electronegative force, a lot of combinations are required and experience has proved that a more complex thermometer is not durable
 yadi is kathinaayee ko dur bhi kar diya jaay to saidhantik kaaran, jo ooshmaagatiki par nirbhar karte hai, yah batalaate hai ki ooshmaa urja ko vidyut urja main parivartit karanevaale taapapunj kii dakshata kabhi bhi ucch nahin hoti
