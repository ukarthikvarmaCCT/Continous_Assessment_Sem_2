 These historical episodes are evidence that support the view that the economy does not always conform to Smith's classic teachings and walrus: they can be best understood for the economy by implicitly assuming that this constant demand is a balance system

 In economic theory, the financial instability hypothesis is an explanation of the substance of Keynes's "general Theory"
 is vyakhya ke itihaas main general theory detaa he
 The General Theory was written in a hurry as a part of the theory intended to explain the great financial and real contraction evidence of the United States and other capitalist economies of the time
 vittiya asthirataa pariklpana bhi joseph shumpiter sankeern arth main vittiya asthirataa pariklpana ke liye mahatvapurn kaam karata he, zaahir he, kar rahe hai haiman pi minski ke dwaara paise or vitt ke credit dekhne par chodta he
 The theoretical rationale of the financial instability hypothesis begins with the characterization of the economy as a capitalist economy with expensive capital assets and a complex, sophisticated financial system
 aarthik samasya nahin balki nitian kii tulana main keens "arthvyavastha kii puunji ke vikaas, " nimna kii pahchaan kii he "vaikalpik rojgaron ke bich die gaye sansadhano kaa aavanton
 "the focus is on one that moves through the actual calendar when capitalist economies freeze

 With the present money exchanged for future money

 As a result of the process from which investment is financed, control over commodities is financed from production units by share capital in liabilities - commitments to pay money at these dates are specified or conditions arise
 prayek aarthik ikai ke liye,apni balance shit par dendariyon se pehle kii ek samay kii shrinkhalaa kaa nirdhaaran bhugtan patibaddhtaon, sampatti kaa ek samay shrinkhalaa utpann ke rup main bhi anumaan lagaaya nakad praptiyon
 Thus, in a capitalist economy linked the ownership of capital assets not only by past, present and future capital assets and labor force characteristics but also by the construction of key financial relationships and the structure of financials
 There have been changes in relations and this structure

 In the modern world, financial relations analyzes and their implications for the behavior of systems cannot be restricted to the liability structure of businesses and the cash flows they require
 pariwaron, sarkaron, or ek parinaam ke rup main antarrashtriya ikaayiyon arthvyavastha kii vartmaan pradarshan isaki pushti yaa amaanya he jo yaa to daayitv sanrachana he
 The increasing complexity of the financial structure in relation to the greater involvement of governments, as agents for financial institutions as well as refinancing ordinary business firms, may behave differently in the system than in earlier eras

 However, a single intervention may well generate a greater degree of inverse bias to the economy
 vittiya sambandhon kaa adhik se adhik jatilta ke baavjood, is pranali ke vyavhaar ke pramukh nirdharak munaafe kaa str bana rahata he
 The financial volatility hypothesis determines the net profit structure of aggregate demand that includes the view of profit

 Traders and their bankers expect investment to take place in the future, as investment now takes place
 vittiya asthirataa pariklpana he, isliye pranali vyavhaar par rin ke prabhaav kaa ek siddhant he or yah bhi karj maanya he jis tareeke se shaamil kiya gaya he
 In contrast to the conservative quantity theory of money, the financial instability hypothesis takes banking seriously as a profit-seeking activity
 bainkon vittiya gatividhiyon or bankeron dwaara munafa chaahate hai
 Like all entrepreneurs in a capitalist economy, bankers are all aware that innovation is an assurance of profits
 is prakaar, ve dallalon yaa dealron ho, chaahe bankeron, ve adhigrahan kii sampatti or ve bazaar dendariyon main nayaa karne ke liye prayaas karte hai jo karj ke vyapaariyon ke hai
 This innovative feature of banking and finance is sufficiently close to being constant whose velocity of circulation is an irreversible item that invalidates the fundamental principle pre-recognition of conservative amounts of money for effect: therefore, in the money supply Change is not a linearly proportional relationship to a well-defined price level
 aarthik ikaayiyon ke liye teen alag-alag aay-rin sambandhon, jo, bachaav, satta, or ponji vitt ke rup main kar sakate hai chihnit kar rahe hai pahachaanaa ja
 Hedge can meet all of the financing units that belong to their cash flow from their contract payment obligations: the greater weight structure of equity financing in liability, the greater the probability that the financing entity is a hedge
 satta vitt ikaayiyon ki kar sakate hai ikaiyaan hai par "aay khaataa" par unke bhugtan kii patibaddhtaon ko puraa unki ve se baahar siddhant nahin chukaa sakate hai, bhale hi dendariyon, inakam nakadi pravaah
 Such units need to "roll over" their liabilities:
 saath rin chal, nigamon ke saath sarkaron vanijyik patr ke muddon par tair rahi he, or bainkon ko aam taur par kar rahe hai bachaav ikaayiyon
 For Ponzi units, cash flows from operations are not sufficient to meet either the principle or repayment of interest payable on the outstanding debt from its cash flow operations
 aisi ikaayiyon kii sampatti ko bechney yaa udhaar le sakate hai
 Borrowing also reduces an entity's equity in the form of paying interest or selling assets to pay interest, it increases liabilities and future prior commitments to income
 ponji vitt ek ikai he ki suraksha ke margin ko kam karti he ki vah apane rin dharakon pradaan karata he
 It can be shown that if the hedge financing dominates, the economy may well have an equilibrium containing demand and systems
 iske vipareet, adhik se adhik, satta or ponji vitt kaa vajan adhik sambhaavna arthvyavastha ek vichlan badhanaa pranali he ki
 The first theorem of the financial instability hypothesis is that the economy is financed under which it is stable, and that it is unstable in which there are financing arrangements
 vittiya asthirataa pariklpana ke duusare prameya he ki lambey samay tak samruddhi, ek asthir pranali ke liye bana he ki vittiya sambandhon ke liye ek sthir pranali ke liye bana he ki vittiya sambandhon se arthvyavastha pargaman kii avadhi main
 In particular, over a long period of good time, capitalist economies tend to move from a financial structure to a structure in which there is speculative dominance of hedge finance units and large weight to units engaged in ponzi finance
 iske alaava, yadi satta kii ek sanstha ke saath ek arthvyavastha vittiya ikaayiyon ke adhikariyon ek mudrasphiti rajya main he, or to, maudrik baadha se mudrasphiti jaadu dena karne kaa prayaas satta ikaayiyon ponji ikaayiyon or ke nival mulya ban jayega pehle se ponji ikaayiyon teji se lupt ho jayega
 As a result, cash flow will be forced to try to create units with flaws by selling out of the situation
 yah ek karne ke liye netritv kii sambhaavna he parisampatti mulyon ke patan
 The financial volatility hypothesis is a model of one who does not rely on exogenous shocks, which generate business cycles of capitalist economy severity
 pariklpana itihaas ke vyapaar chakra se baahar bhi bad jate hai ki rakhti he aantarik poonjivadi arthvyavastha kii gatishiltaa, or rakhane ke liye taiyaar kar rahe hai ki upayon or niyamon kii pranali arthvyavastha uchit seemaa ke bheetar kaam

 Thus the system of governance was completely corrupt, autocratic, passive and exploitative

 Regarding France's chaotic situation, u can be said that "there was no question of bad system, there was no system at all
" " The causes of the revolution can also be seen under social conditions
 francisi samaaj visham or vighatit tha
 That society was divided into three classes / states

 The clergy and the nobility enjoyed wide privileges while the public was devoid of authority

 In this way, the peasants had become so grieved that they themselves turned into a revolutionary element and they needed only a sign to make revolution

 His economic condition was certainly right, yet he was angry with the political, social and economic conditions of the time
 is varg ko koi raajnneetik adhikaar praapt nahin tha or padri or kuleen varg kaa vyavhaar inke prati acha nahin tha
 For this reason the middle class hated the social superiority of the nobles and was willing to change the political system and get their rights
 yahi kaaran tha ki france kii kranti main unka mukhya yogadan rahaa or unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 There were also some economic complaints from the middle class

 They wanted a free environment for their trade business
 iske liye unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 In this way we can say that the French Revolution was the result of the struggle of two conflicting factions of French society
 ek taraf raajnneetik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee or duusari taraf aarthik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee varg the
 To dominate the politics and government of the country, struggle between these two classes was inevitable

 The demand for a meeting of the estate general was eventually called for passing resolutions for the abolition of privilege, and the revolution coincided with the meeting of the estate general in 1789, so the economic plight of the time was considered the most important cause of the French Revolution is

 It would be desirable to understand the views of those philosophers and their relationship with the revolution before passing judgment on any opinion
 darshanikon ke vichaaron kii lokapriyata kaa nirdhaaran to us samay unke chape lekhon ke sanskarnon or prasar ke aadhaar par dekha janaa chahie
 Montescue in his book 'the Spirit of Laws' contradicted the principles of the king's divine rights and offered not only a critique of French political institutions but also an alternative
 usne likhaa ki francisi sarkaar nirkunsh sarkaar he kyonki france main karypalika, nyaaypalika or vidhayika sambandhi sabhi shaktiyaan ek hi vyakti arthath raja ke haathon main kendrit he isliye france kii janata ko swatantraaa praapt nahin he
 It was in this context that he gave the principle of "separation of power", according to which the three principal organs of governance, the executive, the judiciary and the administrator, were advised to be placed in separate hands
 usne england ke saraakar ko adarsh bataaya kyonki vahaan sanvaidhanik rajtantr tha jisase vahaan nagarikon ko swatantraaa thi
 Thus his ideas that Montescue hurt France's autocratic state system through segregation of power became so popular that six editions were published in three years of 'the Spirit of Lodges'
 yahaan dhyaan rakhane kii baat yah he ki montescue ne na to kranti kii baat kii or na hi rajtantr ko samaapt karne kii usne to sirp nirankush rajtantr ke dosha ko ujagar kiya or sanvaidhanik rajtantr kii baat kii

 In this way he firmly believed that the paramount power should be in the hands of the public and not in the hands of any individual or institution
 saarvbhaum satta janata kii ichha main nihit he jise “saamaanya ichha” kaha gaya

 The meeting of the States General was finally called

 All classes were excited to hear the news of the meeting of the States General
 kulina ummid thi ki is baithak main ve un visheshadhikaron ko praapt kar sakenge jo lui 14waan ke samay usne chhin liye gaye the
 The people of the middle class believed that they would be able to formulate progressive policies in their favor
 kisaanon ko aashaa thi ki vah saamanti visheshadhikaron ke viruddh aawaaj uthaakar apane adhikaron ko surakshit kar unke shoshan chakra se mukt ho sakenge
 In this way no significant portion of the French population was ready to support the French monarchy

 Voting was said that each state would be considered to have only one vote

 Representatives of the general public, ie 'third State' opposed this voting system because it would have reduced them to a minority even though they were many
 tritiy state yah chahta tha ki teenon shreniyon ke pratinidhi ek saath baithkar bahumat se nirnay le lekin padri evam kuleen varg alag-alag baithak chaahate the
 Therefore, the Third State boycotted the meeting of the States General and declared itself as a national assembly, representing the entire nation and convened its meeting in the nearby tennis court

 From the point of view of convenience of the study, the revolution can be seen by dividing it into the following four stages
 is charan main paris kii bheed ne bastil ke kile par niyantran sthapit kiya
 This is how the revolution started
 vastutah bastil kaa kila nirankushta evam atyaachaar kaa pratik tha or iske patan se puraatan vyavastha kaa gahari chunauti mili
 The incident also affected the rural areas of France and the villagers set fire to the records of feudal taxes

 So, on 4 August 1789, an overnight session of the National Assembly took place in which all the privileges were abolished by framing laws
 is tarah england or america ko samaapt kar diya gaya
 The important function of the National Assembly was to create a constitution
 atah rashtriya sabha hi samvidhan sabha kahalaayi or 26 agast 1789 ko samvidhan sabha ne maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 The Constituent Assembly declared human rights as its ideals and objectives
 is ghoshnaa main samanta ke siddhanth par bal diya gaya or kaha gaya ki chunki sabhi manushya samaan rup se paidaa hote he atah unhen samaan adhikaar milane chahie
 These rights included freedom, property security and the right to protest against tyranny etc
 is prakaar samvidhan sabha ne aadharbhoot siddhanton, swatantraaa, samanta va janata ke prabhutv kii ghoshnaa kii
 The right to property was repeated in the manifesto
 is adhikaar se kisi ko vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 The National Constituent Assembly seized church property and attempted to reduce the church's control over the public
 is sandarbh main carch ko rajya ke adheen le aayaa gaya or use rome ke pope ke prabhaav se mukt kar rashtriya carch ke rup main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 a "civil Constitution of Clergy" was created to secure the clergy's loyalty to the state
 jiske anusaar padariyon ko rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath leni padati thi or janata ke dwaara unka chunaav hota tha
 The pope and some priests opposed the move
 jin padariyon ne rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath grahan ki ve “jurar” kehalaae jabaki shapath nahin lene vaale “non jurar” kehalaae
 This law created an atmosphere against the revolution because so far the small clergy had supported the revolution
 ab ve isse alag ho gaye or kuch padri desh chhod videshon main chale gaye or vahaan europe main kranti ke viruddh prachaar karne lage
 The National Constituent Assembly prepared a written constitution for France, and this constitution was approved by Louis XVI in 1791

 The National Assembly changed the administrative structure of France
 pracheen praanto ko khatm karke sampoorn desh ko 83 departmenton main vibhakti kiya gaya
 These departments were divided into Cantan and Comune

 Radicals were also divided into two classes - Jirondist and Jacobian
 isi bich france kii kranti kaa bhay europe ke anya deshon ke bhi failane laga
 The clergy and oligarchs who had fled from France to other regions of Europe spread the spirit against the revolution
 duusari taraf france ke krantikari anya deshon main bhi krantikari siddhanton ko prachaar chaah rahe the
 As a result, other kings of Europe became suspicious
 parinamswaroop krantikari france or europe ke anya deshon kaa aapasi sambandh bigadaa
 Austria, despite the refusal of the revolutionaries, had allowed the refugees of the French monarchy to remain with them
 atah vyavasthapika sabha ne apairal 1792 i
 main austria ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar di, kintu france kii sena buree tarah parajeet hui
 The defeat convinced the French people that the king had told Austria all the secrets of France's military power and security
 atah raja ke prati janata kaa ravaiya ugr ho gaya
 In these conditions, in support of the French monarchy, Prasha and Austria declared that the French people should obey the king, otherwise we will take action against them
 is tarah france kii kranti ne europe main yuddh kii sthiti utpann kii
 The announcement made the people of France more enraged and surrounded the king
 raja bhagkar vyavasthapika sabha kii sharan main pahunchaa
 It was now considered that the assembly should be dissolved; a re-election takes place, a new administrative assembly is formed and it gives its decision on the future of monarchy
 isi ke saath vyavasthapika sabha ko samaapt kar diya gaya or vayask matadhikaar ke aadhaar par rashtriya kanveshan kaa gathan hua
 The first session of the National Convention was held on 21 September 1792
 isamen jacobiyan evam jirodist dal pramukh the
 The Jacobians were disciplined and organized
 paris kii bheed par inkaa prabhaav tha
 The main leaders in this were - Dante, Robspier, Heater, etc
 duusari taraf jirondist the- ye shikshit or susanskrit log the
 He had more book knowledge
 faltah ye vyaavhaarik raajnneetijna nahin the
 The prominent leaders were - Isnar, Madame Roland, Brisco etc
 yahaan samajhane kii baat yah he ki donon hi gut ganatantr ke himachati the, videshi shaktiyon ke viruddh yuddh kaa samarthan karte the
 The difference was only in form
 vastutah jirodisto ne france main udaaravaadi sthaan grahan kar liya tha
 He believed that the revolution had gone far ahead and should end
 ve or adhik saamaajik samanta laane ke viruddh the
 He emphasized more on freedom
 udhar jacobiyan log samanta par adhik jor dete the tathaa nimna virgon ke prati sadbhaavpurn ravaiya rakhte the
 The National Convention had three major problems - foreign invasion, the king's presence, and civil war
 sitambar 1792 main francisi sena ne belgium par adhikaar kar liya or dakshin main nise or sevoy bhi uske adhikaar main aa gaye
 Holland, Austria, Prasha and England were terrified by these victories
 krantikariyon ne 1792 main ghoshnaa bhi kar di ki france kaa ganatantr swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kii bhaawanaaon par aadhaarit he or in bhaawanaaon kaa prasar karnaa vah apana kartavya samajhataa he
 France will implement revolutionary principles and seize the property of priests and nobles in the places where it will dominate and whichever country opposes it will be considered as the revolution
 is ghoshnaa se europe ke nirankush rajtantri desh bhaybheet ho gaye or ab france kii kranti france kii na hokar puure europe kii ho gai
 Therefore, the European countries united to stop the spread of revolution and a faction of England, Holland, Austria, Prussia was formed against France
 is gut ne kai jagahon par france ko parajeet kiya
 Consequently, France's defeat in a foreign war became a major problem before the National Convention
 neshnal kanvension ne ek prastaav paarit kar rajtantr ko samaapt kiya or ganatantr kii sthapana kii
 The king was tried for treason and sentenced to death
 raja ke vadh ke prashn par jirondixton kii niti spasht nahin thi
 He was opposed to the monarchy but was referring to the referendum on the question of slaughter
 iske vipareet jacobiyans kaa mat tha ki raja kaa deshadroh siddh ho chukaa he
 Therefore, he should be given death sentence
 atantah 21 janvari 1793 ko lui 16waan faansee par chadha diya gaya
 The National Convention also faced the problem of conflict between the Jacobians and the Zirodists
 vastutah yuddh ke kaaran france aarthik sankat se ghir gaya tha, keemten bad gai thi jisase kanveshan ne raahat dene ke liye vidhaan banaaya, amiron se karj vasuulne kaa niyam banaaya
 These steps were opposed by the Jirandists
 jab jacobio ne paris kii bheed or commune kii sahaayta se kanvension par akraman kar satta par adhikaar kiya or jirondixto ko giraftaar kar aatank ke rajya kii sthapana kii
 With the establishment of the 'state of Terror', France once again fell into disarray
 robspier ke netritv main isaki sthapana kii gai thi
 In this revolutionary, public security was established and anyone who worked against the Jacobs would be punished with death penalty
 robspier ruson kii vichaardhaara se prabhavit tha
 According to which "common desire" is universal desire
 robspier ne satta par niyantran rakhane ke liye virodhiyon ko “gilotin” par chadha diya
 So all the people became suspicious about their lives
 antat july 1794, main robspier kaid kar liya gaya or faansee de di gai isi ke saath aantak ke rajya kii samaapti hui
 The 'state of Thermidorians' was followed by the state of terror
 udaaravaadi thermidorian netaaon ne desh kii satta sanbhali or aantak rajya kii vyavasthaaon ko bhang kiya, jacobiyans ko avaidh ghoshit kiya
 During the rule of terror, control over the price and remuneration imposed was lifted
 jisase keemten punah bad gai, sattebaajon kaa prabhaav bad gaya or pratikriya swaroop vidroh hue lekin in vidronho ko dabaa diya gaya
 Phase III-1794-99 - Rule of "directory" In fact the National Convention formulated a constitution and entrusted the executive responsibility to the 5-member "board of Directors"
 mandal ke sabhi sadasyon ke adhikaar baraabar the
 Each member alternately presided for three months
 prayek varsh ek sadsy kaarykaal samaapt hona tha or uske badale duusare sadsy kii niyukti kii jaani thi
 In this way, the Directory of Rule in France began after the National Convention which lasted from 1795 to 1799
 atan main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kar diya
 This directory rule was disorganized, sad
 sanchaalak mandal ko sashastr senaaon ke niyantran evam senadhyakshon kii niyukti, france kii ore se sandhi karne yaa yuddh karne ke adhikaar praapt the
 The main problem before the Board of Directors was the problem of war, on the other hand the members of the directory were inexperienced, inept and corrupt
 atah diarectory ke shashan kaal main tarah-tarah kii gadabadi faili, bekaari badi, vyapaar thapp pad gaya or uski videsh niti bhi kamjor rahi
 In such a situation, the people of France felt the need for a ruler who could establish peace inside and outside the country and defeat foreign powers
 is kaal main nepolian ne sainya vijayon dwaara france ke sammaan ko sthapit kiya or antat diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kar satta par niyantran sthapit kiya
 In 1799, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule and became the first Council of France and declared himself Emperor in 1804 and thus Napoleon's dictatorial imperialist rule began
 europe main france hi vah desh he jisane kranti ke madhyam se puraatan vyavastha ke patan ko sunishchit kiya
 The impact of this revolution was not limited to Europe
 isane samast vishwa ko prabhavit kiya
 The slogans of revolution spread freedom, equality and fraternity throughout Europe
 ek taraf isane jahaan rashtrawaad, janatantrwaad jaisi nai shaktiyon ko panpane kaa mauka diya to duusari taraf aadhunik taanaashaahee or sainikwaad kii neenv bhi daali
 The effects of the French Revolution can be understood under the following points: francisi kranti kii prakruti ko kranti ke aadarshon, kranti ke netritv, kranti kii pragati, kranti ke dauraan laae gaye parivartanon or vishwa par pade prabhaavon ke prakaash main samajhe jane kii jarurat he
 From this point of view, the revolution was a revolution that was started by the elite, then later it came into the hands of the middle class
 kuch samay ke liye yah krantikari tatwon ke prabhaav main rahi or ant ek sainik taanashaah ke saath hua
 In this way, the French Revolution started like a huge river that started from the high mountain peak and crossed several small mountains in the path, at a rapid, if slow, speed
 1789 main hui francisi kranti ko ek burjua kranti ke rup main dekha ja sakaata he
 The leadership in the first phase of the revolution was in the hands of the bourgeois elements of the Third State
 madhyavargeey netritv ne nijee sampatti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kuch siddhanth bhi banaaen
 In fact, the end of feudalism was declared but feudal rights were not only abandoned, but only after compensating the landlords, the peasants could be relieved of any responsibility
 maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa main madhyavargeey prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 The right to property was placed in the category of natural rights of man which is related to the protection of bourgeois interests
 isi prakaar vayask matadhikaar kii baat to kii gai kintu samvidhan main “naagarik” shabd kaa atyant sankuchit arthon main prayog kiya gaya
 Citizens were divided into active and passive citizens
 sakriy naagarik ve the jo apni kam se kam teen din ke aay kii rakam pratyaksh kar ke rup main adaa karte the or sirp inhen hi mat dene kaa adhikaar tha
 The ability of property to be representative was also made a basis and it was only the rich who could participate in political activities and this meant that the rich people belonged to the middle class
 is tarah francisi kranti ne janm par aadhaarit bhedbhaav ko nasht kiya parantu uske jagah pracheen samantvaad ke badale dhan par aadhaarit nae samantvaad kaa prabhutv hua
 During the revolution, the revolutionaries talked about the loans taken by the autocratic government, but no one talked about forgiving those loans
 iskaa kaaran tha yah rin sarkaar ko burjua varg ne diya tha
 Similarly, the government seized the property of the church but it was not distributed to the landless
 jameenon ko sarvaadhik oonchi keemton par bechaa gaya or is jameen ko kharidne kii kshamta madhyavarg ke paas thi
 The French Revolution ignored the interests of the workers and discouraged the labor movement
 kranti ke dauraan shramik varg ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi kintu burjua netritv ko uski badhati sthiti manjuur nahin thi
 Therefore, the National Assembly re-enacted the laws made in the autocratic monarchy era
 jiske tahat sabhi shramik sangh sambandhi kaaryon par pratibandh laga diya gaye or gildon ko gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit kar diya gaya
 In the National Assembly, the bourgeoisie dominated and the Jirondist and Jacobians also belonged to the bourgeoisie
 yadhyapi jacobiyan sarvhaara varg ke hit kii baat karte the parantu aatank ke rajya kii sthapana main burjua hiton ko hi upar rakhaa gaya or shramikon pratikriyaaon ko dabaane hetu sena kii sahaayta lee gai
 Middle-class interests were also given prominence in directory governance
 sanchaalak mandal ne jis dwisadani vidhayika kaa nirmaan kiya uske sabhi sadsy madhyavargeey buddhijivi the
 The bourgeoisie effect can also be seen on Napoleon's reforms
 usne burjua hiton ko sangrakshit rakhte hue apni vidhi samhita main sampatti ke adhikaar ko surakshit rakhaa, kulinon ko apekshaakrit vyapak adhikaar die tathaa uske vyapaarik or vanijyik sudhaaron kaa phayda madhyavarg ko hi mila
 In this way, middle class elements are seen in the form of revolution
 kintu puure kranti or uske prabhaav ke vishleshan se yah spasht hota he ki kranti main madhyavargeey tatwon ke saath krishak, majdoor, mahilaon kii sahamaagita thi
 In this way, it was not just a middle class revolution, but it can be seen as a popular revolution
 francisi kranti ek vishwavyaapee charitra ko liye hue thi
 The revolutionaries declared human and civil rights in 1789, under which it was said that being born equal from birth, all human beings should get equal rights and this is for all nations, for all human beings, for all time and for example
 Are for the world
 yah ghoshnaa sirp france ke liye nahin varan har jagah ke un sabhi logon kii bhalaai ke liye hai jo swatantra hona chaahate the tathaa nirankush rajtantr evam saamanti visheshadhikaron ke boj se mukti paanaa chaahate the, banaaya gaya tha
 In 1792 AD, the English hero named Kompene was awarded the title of French citizen by the National Assembly and was also elected a delegate to the National Convention
 isi prakaar kranti ke dauraan yah vichaar aayaa ki kranti ko sthaayee or sudrudh rakhane ke liye ise europe ke anya deshon main bhi vistaarit kiya jaaen
 It envisages a war in which French forces enter neighboring countries and meet local revolutionaries and overthrow the monarchy and establish republics
 france kii kranti maatr ek rashtriya ghatana nahin thi apitu siddhanton- swatantraaa, samanta evam bandhutav ke naaron se sampurna europe gunj uthaa
 The effects of the revolution were so far-reaching that all of Europe was covered by it
 isi sandarbh main kaha gaya “yadi france ko zukam hota he to samast europe cheenkta he
 " france kii kranti roosi kranti ke samaan suniyojit nahin thi
 In fact, the Russian Revolution was planned by the Bolsheviks and its aim was to establish the rule of the proletariat by gaining power, but the French Revolution was a victim of events and circumstances from the beginning to the end and the events did not happen in the way that the revolutionaries wished but rather the events gave the revolutionaries Forced to change his path
 stats general kii baithak main yadi tritiy state kii baat anya stats ne maan lee hoti to kranti kaa ruukh doosraa hota
 Similarly, the state of terror and the rule of the directory also did not run in a planned manner
 is drushti se yah kranti avyavasthit thi
 The degeneration of erstwhile French society was also an important factor in the origins of the French Revolution
 puraa samaaj visheshadhikaar praapt or adhikaar viheen virgon main vibhakt tha
 The condition of the peasants was bad due to the burden of taxes, on the other hand they had to suffer exploitation by the tyranny of the feudal and the intervention of the church
 in sthitiyon ne kranti ko raah dikhaai or krantikariyon ne isi asamanta ke viruddh aawaaj buland kii or swatantraaa, samanta tathaa bandhutav kaa naaraa diya
 It was only during the revolution that the end of feudalism was announced, the privileges were abolished

 In fact, during the revolution, a dictatorial government or dictatorship was established under the leadership of Robspier and later the Nepalese also established the dictatorship
 france kii kranti vahaan kii puraatan vyavastha main vyaapt tamaam vikrutiyon, visangatiyon evam buniyadi dosha ke viruddh ek shashakt pratikriya thi
 The revolution paved the way for democratic governance in France by ending French society based on autocratic monarchy inequality, luxury clergy and the crisis facing economic insolvency
 is drushti se ise drushti se ise pragatisheel kranti ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he Not only this, the declaration of human rights, the slogan of freedom, equality and fraternity and the ideology of nationalism made the whole world aware of the slogan of nationalism and the ideology of nationalism
 italy evam germany ke ekikaran kii bhaavana ko protsaahan mila
 The issue of segregation of religion and politics first arose during this revolution

 France's state revolution enjoys special importance in world history, it is considered an important event in human history
 isamen na keval france balki europe ke jan jivan main amulya parivartan laa diya isamen shadiyon se chali aa rahi saamanti vyavastha ko nasht kar aadhunik loktantric vyavastha kaa maarg praast kiy
 The autocracy of the monarchy came to an end and people breathed peace in the democratic atmosphere
 is samay hamaare saamne yah prashan uthta he ki 1789 i
 main kranti kaa sutrapat anya europe deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi kyon hui
 a study of European nations of the 18th century showed that the condition of France at that time was worse than that of other Europe nations
 nirankush rajtantr suvidha yukt varg or karon ke asaahneey bhaar se dabaa hua tha
 Ordinary classes were present in almost all European countries

 French farmers were happier than other European nations
 saadhaaran varg kii sthiti anya europe rajyon main or bhi kharaab thi
 Nevertheless, the revolution took place not in these countries but in France first
 iskaa pramukh kaaran yah tha kii france log apni sthiti ke prati jaagruk the
 It is not a necessary condition for revolution that its explosion takes place in the same countries where people are victims of atrocities, incest and exploitation
 samrudh or unnat desh main bhi kranti ho sakati he
 Provided that its residents feel that injustice is being done to them
 france kii janata is anyaay ko mahasus kar rahi thi

 There were many reasons for this revolution which are as follows
 frasisi saamanton kaa badla hua swarup or kisaano kii unnat avasthaa- Such was the reason for the advanced state of French peasants and the changed nature of feudalism
 jiske chalate france main sarv pratham rajyakranti hui
 Farmers in the European country were still in a state of gloom
 parantu france ke kisaan swatantra ho chuke the
 They did not own their own land and own their own land in spite of such convenience and feudal services, they had to pay a large part of their income in the form of feudal tax
 or phir bhi uski sthiti acchhee dhi
 They used to buy some land by saving money and the hunger to buy land was constantly increasing, there was a problem of feudalism and unemployment, so they were thinking of removing the feudal occupations, so they got strength under the leadership of the middle class
 And in 1789 AD they revolted
 france main udaar nirankushta kii parampara kaa abhaav- Other European countries also had autocratic monarchies
 parantu vahaan ke samraaton ne samaynusaar apni nirankushta main kami kar di thi
 King Fredirak of Prasha was the great enlightened administrator of his time
 jiskaa anusaran europe ke anya desh rus germany, italy, spain aadi ne kiya
 In due course of time, he tried as much as possible to improve the economic, physical and other fields
 parantu france main is tarah ki udaar nirankushta kaa abhaav tha
 The kings there were doing nothing for the benefit of the people
 balki adhik tex vasulanaa or janata kaa shoshan karnaa unki niti ban gai thi
 Therefore, the French people were fed up with it, so the people of France wanted to end the autocratic monarchy
 maadyam varg kii jaagarukta- The reason for the first revolution in France was the middle class there
 anya deshon main bhi madhyam varg thi parantu ve france kii tarah saanskriti, dhani evam shikshit nahin the
 He lacked strength
 ve raja ke khilaaf baghawat karne kii soch nahin sakate the
 The middle class people in France were dissatisfied with their emperors for many reasons
 or apni raksha ke liye raaj satta par ankush lagane ke liye utawala ho rahe the
 Other European states lacked this type of situation
 anya deshon main netritv karne vaala koi nahin tha france main jaagruk madhyamvarg taiyaar tha
 Therefore, revolution first took place in France itself
 kulinvarg kii anupayogita- The elite Vigyan was given the first privilege to help the king in running the rule
 or ve janaata kii raksha bhi karte the
 But slowly - 2 started doing this work for the king's employees
 falat: kulinon kii upyogita samaapt ho gai
 Yet there was no cut in its prerogative
 isliye kisaan or madhyam varg ke log kulinvarg se ghrinaa karne lage
 This was not the case in other countries
 vahaan abhi bhi kulinon ki payogita bani hui thi
 The influence of philosophers 18 veen shatabdi main sampoorn europe main boudik halchal machi hui thi
 Philosophers, thinkers, scientists were present in all countries
 parantu unamem mukhya france ke vichaarak the
 Who presented the psychological basis of the revolution
 unhone samaaj main vaypt buraaiyon kii ore logon kaa dhyaan aakrisht karaayaa or muk janata ko vaani di
 Such an attempt was not being made in other countries
 montegu, waltare ruso aadi vichaarkon kaa kaary kshetra france hi tha
 Austria, Prasha and Russia did not have such thinkers
 europe ke anya deshon main logon kaa unki vaastavik sthiti bataane vaala or unamem santosh paidaa karne vaala darshanikon kaa koi varg nahin tha
 This was a major reason for revolution in France itself
 raajnneetik sahabhaagita kaa abhaav- When the middle class became aware in England, they were given the opportunity to participate in the politics of the country
 parantu france ke saath aisi baat nahin thi
 The middle class of France was quite dissatisfied with its emperors
 unki apeksha kii jaati thi
 Despite being educated, they did not have a reputation like the nobles
 unhen france kii raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa avasar nahin diya jaataa tha
 Therefore, he dissented and raised the slogan of revolution
 ayogy raja tathaa prashasan main bhrashtachar- The political system of France was centralized but the kings were inept
 prashasan main bhrashtachar kaa bolbalaa tha
 In other countries of Europe, autocratic rule was broken but kings were eligible and they had full control over governance
 france kaa madhyam varg is prashasnic bhrashtatar ko mahasoos kar rahaa tha
 And so he was ready to revolt
 rashtriya bhaavana kaa udai- At this time, national sentiment began to rise rapidly in Europe
 sampoorn europe main france hi ek aisa desh tha jahaan ek raashtra bhaavana kaa purnat: abhaav tha
 Due to this, there was a revolution in France for the first time
 america swatantraaa sangram kaa prabhaav- The American War of Independence started in 1766 AD
 gimen america ke logon ne england ke khilaaf vidroh kar kar diya
 The soldiers of France also got an opportunity to participate in this freedom struggle, so they felt that freedom can be achieved through war
 unhone yah bhi anubhav kiya ki swatantraaa so hi sukh kii prapti sambhav he
 On returning to France, he saw that the freedom he fought for in America is the complete lack of freedom in France
 at: ve yahan kii kranti ke liye baichaiyn ho uthe or yuddh ke dwaara swatantraaa praapt karne kii cheshtaa karne lage
 This was not the case in other countries of Europe
 francisi sabhyataa kii shreshthata- a specific reason for the revolution in France itself was that the civilization and culture of other Europe was more prosperous and rich than other European nations
 shashan vyavastha kii drushti se bhi france kaa shashan atyadhik suvyavasthit tha
 France is considered a symbol of civilization and culture throughout Europe
 sampoorn europe main paris sahitya or chintan kaa sabase bada kendra mana jaataa he
 The France public opinion was more aroused and critical than other European states
 in sabhi kaarnon ke falswarup 1789 i

 The computer age in India began in 1952 with the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata
 san 1952 main ai es ai main ek anolong computer kii sthapana kii gai thi jo bharat kaa pratham computer tha
 This computer could solve a matrix of 10 x 10
 isi samay bhartiya vigyaan santhaan bangalore main bhi ek analog computer sthapit kiya gaya tha jiskaa prayog avkalan vishleshak ke rup main kiya jaataa tha
 But even after all this, the computer age in India really started in 1956, when India's first electronic digital computer HEC-2M was installed at ISI Kolkata
 yah computer keval bharat kaa pratham electronic computer hone ke kaaran khaas nahin tha balki isliye bhi khaas tha kyonki isaki sthapana ke saath hi bharat japan ke baad asia kaa doosraa aisa desh ban gaya tha jisane computer takanic ko apanaaya tha
 In fact, HEC-2M was built in England, not in India
 jahaan se ise aayaat karke ai es ai main sthapit kiya gaya tha
 It was developed by Andrew Donald Booth, who was then a professor working at the Burkeback College in London
 The computer was a 16-bit computer with a 1024-word drum memory that used machine language to operate and punch cards for input and output, but was later added to the printer
 chunki yah desh kaa pratham digital computer tha isliye sampoorn desh se vibhinn prakaar kii vaigyanik samasyaon kaa samaadhaan is computer se kiya jaataa tha jaise suraksha vibhaag tathaa prayogshaalaon se sambandhit samasyaayen vibhinn prakaar ke vishleshak aadi | But this development story does not end there
 In 1958, another computer named URAL was installed in ISI which was bigger than HEC-2M in size
 is computer ko rus se kharida gaya tha
 This name is actually the name of a mountain range of Russia and since this computer was also purchased from Russia, due to this reason this computer was given this name
 The computer was a 32-bit computer with dynamic magnetic tape, using punch cards as input and printers as output
 san 1964 main in donon computer ko tab viraam de diya gaya jab ibiem ne ai es ai main apana computer 1401 sthapit kiya | ibiem 1401, 1400 shrinkhalaa kaa pehla computer tha jise ibiem dwaara san 1959 main viksit kiya gaya tha jo kii ek data processing system computer tha
 This computer mainly consisted of 1401 processing units which could calculate 1,93,300 totals in a minute
 Also, this computer used punch cards for input as well as magnetic tape and an IBM 1403 printer for output
 in sabhi computer main jo ek samanta thi vah yah thi ki ye sabhi computer bharat main viksit nahin hue the balki inhen duusare deshon se kharida gaya tha
 ISIJU was the first computer developed in India, this computer was developed in 1966 by two institutes Indian Statistical Institute and Jadavpur University
 jis kaaran ise ISIJU naam diya gaya | HEC - 2M tathaa URAL donon hi vaikum tub yukt computer the jabaki ISIJU ek transistor yukt computer tha
 The development of this computer was extremely important for Indian computer technology, although this computer did not fulfill the business computing requirements, due to which no specific work was done by it
 bharat main computing vikaas main sabase mahatvapurn charan aayaa 90 ke dashak main jab pune main sthit pragat sanganan vikaas centre main bharat kaa pratham super computer ' param 8000 ' kaa vikaas kiya gaya | param kaa arth he parallel machine jo ki aaj super computer kii ek shrinkhalaa he | param kaa prayog vibhinn kshetro main kiya jaataa he jaise bioinformetics ke kshetra main, mausam vigyaan ke kshetra main, rasayan shaastra ke kshetra main aadi | Although computer technology is spreading in many thousands of homes and offices in India today due to the arrival of personal computers, all these analogs, mainframes and supercomputers have contributed invaluably in making India a developing country

 mineral exploration corporation limited bharat sarkaar kaa ek saarvajanik kshetra kaa upkram he
 It was established in October 1972 as an autonomous public company under the administrative control of the Ministry of Mines, Government of India
 iskaa uddeshy kisi purvekshan sthal kii khoj or antat uske vidohan ke bich antaraal ko kam karne ke liye khanijon ke vyavasthit gaveshan karnaa he
 mecl's mission is to "provide high quality, cost-effective and time-bound geological services for exploration and exploitation of minerals
" ’’ MECL since its inception has completed 1264 project reports of minerals such as coal, lignite, bauxite, copper, gold, lead, zinc, iron ore, limestone, manganese, magnesite, chromite, fluospar and many other industrial minerals and 149034 million Tons of ore are mineral certified
 isane khanijon ke khanan or sajjikaran, sibiem ke liye utpaadan coop vedhan or koyala stakon ke pratichayan va vishleshan ke kshetra main apni sevaaon kaa vividhrupan kiya he
 Kinjadi is a plant native to southwest India
 yah multah pashchimi ghat evam karnataka ke wanon main miltaa he
 It is also called Kindle by people associated with urban trade, but many names are prevalent in the local language
 yah lakdi ke liye aarthik rup se mahatvapurn hota he
 Medicinal uses are also used for rearing silkworms
 25 agast gregory calendar ke anusaar varsh kaa 237wa din he
 There are 128 days left in the year
 1980 Nitin Gore The method of coating metals by electric current is called electrolysis
 bahudhaa lohe kii vastuon ko sanksharan se bachaane tathaa chamak ke liye, un par taanbe, nikal athwa chromium kaa lepan kiya jaataa he
 After the base metal is coated, the outer properties of the metal being coated are visible
 isse vastu kaa bahari rup rang nikhar jaataa he tathaa saath hi vastu sanksharan se bhi bachati he
 The metal to be coated by electrolysis is well attached to the base metal and coating can often be done in a permanent way
 vidyutlepan sajja ke mukhya ansh nimnlikhit hai - 1
 Electrophoresis bath - filled with a metal compound to be coated, which breaks down into metal ions as the current flows and these ions get coated on the base metal surface
 2
 disht dhara kaa strot - yah saamanyat: ek dishtakaari hota he or prayavarti dhara ko disht dhara main badalata he
 3
 The base metal object to be coated - it is associated with the loan terminal of the stream
 dhan terminal anode se sambhddha hota he, jo lepan kii janevaali dhaatu ke yogic main duba rahata he
 When current flows between the two terminals, the metallic silver ions move toward the bottom of the cathode and are converted into metallic form and cling to the bottom
 lepan kii motaai dhara ke ghanatv evam lepan ke kaal par nirbhar karti he
 The direct current can be used for electrification, otherwise there will be no ablative action
 jahaan sambharan prayavarti dhara kaa hota he vahaan ise disht dhara main parivartit karnaa aavashyak hota he
 This can be done by directional or motor-generator sets
 kisi vastu par vidyutlepan karne se pehle, use acchhee prakaar saaf kiya jaataa he
 There should not be any kind of oily substance, grease, or dust particles on it, otherwise the coating will not be strong
 saaf karne ke liye kuch rasinic vilyanon kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he or unase dhone ke baad, dhatviya oxidon ko hataane ke liye, lepan kii janevaali vastu ko salphurik amla athwa hydrochloric amla ke tanu vilyan main daal diya jaataa he
 After that, the object is hung in the lapan vath as a cathode to be coated
 lepan bath, saamanyat: achaalak padaarth kii tank ke rup main hota he, jisamen lepan kii janevaali dhaatu kaa rasinic vilyan bharaa hota he
 For copper coating, this solution is of copper sulphate
 nikal lepan ke liye nikal salphet kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Some of their other chemical compounds are used for their specific coating
 vaise to koi bhi dhaatu, kisi duusari dhaatu par lepit kii ja sakati he, parantu vyaavhaarik rup main adhikanshat: lohe kii vastuon par tamra, nikal athwa chromium kaa lepan kiya jaataa he or taanbe tathaa pital kii vastuon par chaandi athwa sone kaa lepan kiya jaataa he
 Lapan has another practical difficulty
