 Set up for the first time in Sweden, the organization monitors the activities of the administrative and public representatives of its country, investigates the complaints lodged by the public against them and takes action or arranges to get the blame corrected
 sweden main varsh 1713 main king chalrs barahawein ne apane ek sabhasad ko un adhikariyon ko dandit karne ke liye niyukt kiya jo kanoon kaa ulanghan karte the
 On the formation of the new constitution, the members of the Constituent Assembly insisted that only one of their officers would do the work of investigation
 vah sarkari adhikari nahin ho saktaa
 Then in 1809 the Constitution of Sweden provided for the Ambudsmann
 hui jo adaalaton or loksevakon dwaara kanoonon tathaa viniyamon ke ulanghan ke prakaran kii jaanch karegaa
 In Sweden, Ambudsmann is nominated by the President for four years
 vah desh ke sarvshereshth nyayavid or sarvocch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhishon main se hota he
 Every year its annual report is presented in the initial session of Parliament
 sweden ke shaskeey sevak mantreey niyantran main nahin hote hai
 Ministers there are only concerned with policy matters while administration is mostly self-governing
 sweden ke naukarshah kanoon ke prati javabdeh hote hai
 The public servant's negligence, discretion and ignorance make him eligible for prosecution
 unke abhiyojan kii sweekruti dene vaala adhikari ambudsman kehalaata he
 Ambudsman investigates complaints against convicted officials that are made by the public
 santusht hone par unke prakaran agrim kaarywahiyon ke liye nyaayalayon main bhejtaa he
 Unlike Sweden, the Council of Ministers had been responsible for the work of bureaucrats in Denmark
 lekin 1953 ke samvidhan or ambudsman adhinium 1954 ke tahat denmark main bhi sweden kii tarah ambudsman kii sthapana kii gai
 The famous jurist Professor Stephen Harwitz was initially appointed to that position
 denmark ke ambudsman kii niyukti sansad dwaara prayek aam chunaav ke baad kii jaati he
 Parliament is only able to remove it
 denmark ke ambudsman ke nirnyon par sansad main punarvichaar nahin hota
 mantri bhi ambudsman kii paridhi main aate hai
 Denmark's Ambudsmann cannot prosecute itself as it does in Sweden
 vah keval abhiyojan adhikari ko abhiyojan chalaane ke aadesh detaa he
 He can advise the citizen against the rule to prosecute
 is kaary ke liye kanoonee suvidha bhi uplabdh kara saktaa he
 He eventually sends the report of his actions to Parliament
 norway main vishwayuddh ke baad nagarikon ne adhikariyon or rajanetaaon ke khilaaf shikayaton kaa pahaad khadaa kar diya tha
 In 1945, the Norwegian government appointed a committee for administrative procedures
 yah jaananaa dilachasp he ki britain, america or european paddati ke ambudsman ke baad is samiti ne 1958 main sifarish kii ki denmark ke model ko sweekaar kar liya jaae
 1968 main norway main ambudsman kanoon banaaya gaya
 The Norwegian parliament elects Ambudsmann
 use ek shreshth nyayavid hi hona chahie
 uskaa mukhya kartavya yah dekhnaa he ki lok prashasan main kisi naagarik ke saath anyaay nahin ho
 The Ambudman of Norway does not have the authority to prosecute like Sweden nor can he order the prosecution of an officer like the Ambudsman of Denmark
 vah keval dhyaan aakrisht karata he ki amuk adhikari ne amuk galati kii he or us par sanstuti karata he ki doshi adhikari ke viruddh uchit nyaayik kaarywahi kii jaae

 References were also examined to examine the conduct of public servants and to keep healthy norms of administration relevant
 ombusdsman The seminar examined five main institutions that were in force at the time as investigative agencies around the world
 inamen sansadeey jaanch samitiyaan, rus kii procurasi, angreji vidhi vyavastha main varnit nyaayik anutosh, francisi paddati kii jaanch vyavasthaaen tathaa scandinavian deshon main prachlit ambudsman bhi shaamil rahe hai
 Among them, an organization called Ambudsaman has achieved international success in being the watchdog of the administration
 jet nodan yaa kshippranodan, nodan kii vah vidhi he jisamen vastu par aage kii taraf dhakka lagane ke liye us vastu kii gati kii vipareet disha main padaarth kaa jet kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Its mechanism is based on Newton's third law of motion
 yah ek prakaar kii pratikriya pranodan he arthath isamen pratikriya kii shakti ko kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 This propulsion is often used in jet engines
 isi prakaar antariksh yanon ke liai bhi jet nodan sabase adhik upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 The process of moving beyond jet propulsion is also seen in many animals, such as headparts, arthropod animals, sea rabbits, and fishes
 newton ke teen prasiddh niyamon main se ek yah he ki har kaary kii pratikriya hoti he
 For example, if any weight is given above the table, this load is acting as the table is pressed downwards and because the table is lifting this load, the table pressure is upward due to which the load is lifted
 isi upree dabaav ko pratikriya kaha jaataa he or jahaan bhi koi kaary ho rahaa ho, pratikriya kaa kisi na kisi rup main hona aavashyak he
 When a gun is fired, it is pushed backwards
 yadi is bandook ke peeche koi gend rakh di jaae to is dhakke ke kaaran gend uchhalkar bahut dur ja sakati he
 In each machine, the action power is employed and arrangements are made to withstand the reaction, such as firing a gun into a gun and causing it to withstand the blows
 parantu kshippranodan main isi pratikriya se vah kaam liya jaataa he jo acchhee mashine bhi nahin kar saktin
 Piston engines have been used to run all types of motor vehicles, air and water vessels
 din prati din in injanon main nai nai khoj hoti rahi or inase adhik se adhik shakti praapt hone lagi
 The demands of more rapid movement of these machines have led to the appraisal of these engines that their further development is no longer possible
 saath hi saath is unnati ke kaaran inaki mashine itani ulajh gayi ki inaki suvidha se bananaa or upyog karnaa kathin ho gaya
 Hence the use of gas turbine, due to which the speed of air and water vessels was greatly increased
 ab kshippranodan ko do prakaar se liya ja saktaa he, ek to gas tarabine ke saath or doosraa keval kship kaa hi upyog
 If the exit hole of this gas is small then it will come out with force, which will push the car and it will start moving forward
 jaise jaise gas jor se baahar niklegi vaise vaise gaadi kii chaal bhi badhati jaaygi
 If the car is light and does not have friction
 to isaki chaal adhik tej hogi
 The reason for this vehicle to run in this way is said here that when the gas comes out of the hole, it hits the air outside and that is why the vehicle moves forward, but this is not the case
 yadi ise bina hawa ke sthaan par chalaaya jaay to isaki chaal or bhi teevr hogi
 So it is only the reaction that drives it
 is prakaar peeche nikalanevaali kship ke dabaav ke hi kaaran yah shakti praapt hoti he
 Whereas more speed was required, tilting was used
 vastut: kshippranodan kaa vyavhaar vahiin par safal hoga jahaan adhik gati kii aavashyaktaa ho
 In order to save time during the war, Kship airplanes were advanced and used in flying bombs
 bhoomi par chalanevaali mashiinon main gharshan adhik hota he
 And they cannot be run at high speed
 at: unamem kshippranodan laabhkar siddh nahin hua
 The actual advancement of tricyclicity occurred in air and water vessels
 is prakaar ke hawaii jahaajon ke halake injanon or teevr chaal ne samay ko itnaa gata diya he ki sansar ke ek kone se duusare kone main bahut thode samay main hi pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 There is only one rule for all types of locomotives
 sab ingine baahar kii hawa ko apane bheetar khinchate hai or iske bheetar hawa tathaa eendhan mil jate he, jahaan donon jalakar failte he
 Due to this spread the machine gets pushed
 jalane ke samay eendhan or hawa kii nishpati adhik hoti he or jab mashin chal padati he to hawa kaa mishran adhik ho jaataa he
 The gas produced by the burning of air and fuel is given more speed
 gas ko adhik gati usee samay mil sakati he jab use thik prakaar se failane kaa avasar diya jaae
 But the pressure of the gas will decrease in this spread, because the gas has to be released in the same air from where the air was drawn in to mix with the fuel
 isliye daab ke ghatane se puri shakti praapt na hogi
 As long as there is no full pressure behind the gas, propulsion will not be able
 at: gas ke peeche puri daab praapt karne ke liye sampidak mashin kii vyavastha kii jaati he
 a gas turbine is installed to run this compressor
 hawa ko sampidak baahar se khinchakar tarabine kii ore puure bal kesath phenkata he
 The fuel is mixed between the turbine and the compressor in this air and this mixture is given an opportunity to burn
 iske jalane se aaytan tathaa taap ek hi daab par badhate hai
 This power is so much that it can run the turbine and it also has full kinetic energy for its operation
 sampidak hawa ko khinchakar dahan kothriyon ko detaa he, jahaan eendhan pehle se jalataa hua miltaa he or yah gas adhik taap par tarabine ko jaati he
 The turbine runs from this gas and it also drives the turbine compressor
 tarabine se nikalakar yah gas kship kii bhanti failati hui adhik daab par baahar nikalati he
 This turbine consumes less fuel than other engines at running time, but at increased speeds it takes less fuel from all engines
 oonchaai par pahunchakar to yah or bhi kam eendhan kharch karata he
 The speed of the airplane operating from this turbine is not required
 samay kii bachat or lambii yatraaon ke liye aavashyak he ki hawaii jahaaj kaa vajan kam ho or gati adhik
 This can happen if the airplane only has tarnishing in which turbines are not used
 isaki mashin main bahut se kal purajon kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 This machine has only three parts
 pehla bhaag aage kaa he jisame hawa ke liye kapaat hai or eendhan kii nalee he jiske dwaara pump se eendhan bheetar phenkaa jaataa he
 Due to timely opening of these valves, air enters
 yah kapaat us samay band hote hai jab eendhan or hawa jalakar gas ban jaati he
 The fuel bursts and the gas escapes
 doosraa bhaag dahan kothri kaa he or teesraa bhaag ingine ke peeche kii naalee kaa he, jisaki lambaai ingine kii shakti ke anusaar rakhi jaati he
 When it has to be run, fuel is first sprayed and set on fire
 is samay hawa ke kapaat khul jate hai or hawa bheetar aakar eendhan ke saath mil jaati he
 Adulteration is done properly
 eendhan or hawa kaa mishran lagbhag 2 milicenkad main jal jaataa he or iskaa taap 250 sein
 or daab 100 pratishat bad jaati he
 Now this gas goes towards the drain so it spreads before going into the drain
 jab yah naalee main jaati he to naalee kaa vyas chota hone ke kaaran iskaa taap 9000 sein
 or daab ghatakar 95 pratishat ho jaati he
 The time it takes to get out of the closet can be 8 milliseconds
 is prakaar eendhan or hawa ke mishran se utpann dhadaaka ek duusare ke pashchaat jaldi jaldi hoti he
 On the force of this blast and the rapid exit of the gas, the machine is found for propulsion
 eendhan ko pehle bijli se jalaayaa jaataa he, kintu mashin ke chalane par dahan kothri itani tap jaati he ki eendhan apane aap hi jal jaataa he
 The length of the fuel drain is kept so that the gas bursts out before the air valve opens
 is prakaar kii mashiinon kaa upyog aapse aap chalanevaale bamgolon main kiya gaya tha or ab hawaii jahaajon main kiya jaataa he, parantu isak chalaane ke liye lambey sthaan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or chalane ke samay isaki gati adhik honi chahie
 It was previously thought that replacing the piston engine would not require much tomorrow if it was used to replace the piston engine, but it did not
 kshippranodan ke upyog ke saath hi yah pataa chalaa ki keval eendhan ke panpon ko badi saavdhaanee se bananaa he or eendhan tathaa hawa kaa niyantran thik rakhana nitant aavashyak hai
 Suppose the volume of gas released is per second and its speed is c
 mashin ko chalaanevaali shakti m x ga hui
 If the area of the exit point of the gas is q, then there will be two pressures at this place, one is the pressure of the exiting gas which is Ni 1 and the other is the pressure of air at this place, say, Ni 2
 ye donon daaben ek duusare ke viruddh hongi
 Hence the pressure at this place will be q which will work with mx c
 isliye pranodan kii puri shakti = m x ga + ksha hogi
 If the gas exit hole is made so that the pressure spreads to the gas, then Ni1 = Ni2, so power = m x c
 yahi pranoday kaa samirkan kaha jaataa he
 The performance ratio of propulsion can be shown from the following equation
 jahaan ga kship kii gati he or r mashin ke chalane kii gati
 This working ratio would be greatest if c = r, that is, if the speed of the machine is equal to the speed of the speed

 Rajinder Pal played the only Test match for the Indian cricket team in his career while 98 first-class cricket matches
 jisamen inhone 337 wicket liye the
 List of Sarsanghchalakas of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: praaia: aisa kaha jaataa he ki ki sangh ek vikasshil sanghathan he
 Not only branch or miscellaneous work, many traditions also develop on their own
 paariwarik sanghathan hone ke kaaran yahaan har kaam ke liye samvidhan nahin dekhnaa padataa
 The outside viewer may find it strange; But those who have been watching the Sangh and its functioning for a long time are familiar with its reality
 unke liye yah saamaanya baat he
 If we look at the Sarsanghchalak tradition, then His Holiness Dr
 Hedgewar was made Sarsanghchalak by his colleagues without his knowledge
 dow ji ne is avasar par kaha ki aapke aadesh kaa paalan karte hue main yah jimmedaari le rahaa hum; par jaise hi mujhase yogya koi vyakti aapako mili, aap use yah daayitv de dena
 i will work with him like a normal volunteer
 jab doctor ji kaa swasthya bahut bighad gaya, to unhone apane sahyogiyon se paraamarsh kar apane lumber-panchar oparation se purv sabake saamne hi shri guruji ko bataa diya ki mere baad aapako sangh kaa kaam sanbhaalanaa he
 Thus the Sangh attained the second Sarsanghchalak
 jab shri guruji ko laga ki ab yah sharir lambe samay tak saath nahin de paaegaa, to unhone bhi apane sahyogi kaaryakartaaon se paraamarsh kiya or ek patr dwaara shri balasahab devaras ko naveen sarasanghachaalak ghoshit kiya
 The letter was opened after his death
 balasahab ne shri guruji ke dehanth ke baad yah jimmedaari sanbhali, isse logon ke man main yah dharna bani ki yah jimmedaari aaajeevan hoti he tathaa purv sarasanghachaalak apni icchaanusaar kisi ko bhi yah daayitv de sakate hai
 The opponents of the Union used to call it a secret organization; But now they also considered it undemocratic
 shri balasahab devaras ne apane purv ke donon sarasanghachaalkon dwaara apanaayi gayi vidhi se hatakar naye sarasanghachaalak kii niyukti kii
 He declared Shri Rajju Bhaiya the new Sarsanghchalak in front of all the representatives of the All India House of Representatives, when the health was very bad
 maa0 rajju bhaiya or phir shri sudarshan ji ne bhi isi vidhi kaa paalan kiya
 Thus a new tradition developed in the Sangh
 is ghatnakram ko ek or drushtikon se dekhen
 When Balasaheb was relieved of his obligation, his health was very poor
 ve pahiyaa kursi par hi chal pate the
 Spit was frequently filled in the mouth, so he had difficulty in speaking too
 unke likhit sandesh hi sab kaaryakramon main sunaae jate the
 They were also able to perform their daily activities with the help of someone
 is kaaran unki daayitv mukti ko sabane sahajata se liya
 On the other hand, when Rajju Bhaiya left the job, he was not fully healthy; Were able to migrate
 saarvajanik rup se manch par bolne main unhen bhi kathinaayee hoti thi; par vyaktigat vaarta ve sahajata se karte the
 He migrated to many provinces despite being free from responsibility
 arthath yadi ve chaahate, to do-teen varsh or is jimmedaari ko nibhaa sakate the; par unhone upyukt vyakti paakar yah kaarybhaar chhod diya
 As far as the fifth Sarsanghchalak Shri Sudarshan ji is concerned, he was quite healthy till his discharge
 pravaas ke saath-saath saarvajanik rup se bolne main unhen kuch kathinaayee nahin thi
 Yet when he felt that a well-qualified and energetic worker in front of Mr
 Mohan Bhagwat was in front, he too relinquished responsibility
 spasht he ki unhone vahi kiya, jo aadya sarasanghachaalak dow headgavar ne padbhaar sweekaar karte samay kaha tha ki jab bhi mujhase adhik yogya kaaryakarta aapako mili, aap use sarasanghachaalak bana den
 i will work according to his instructions
 yah he ek parampara main vishwaas or duusari parampara kaa vikaas
 What would be a more beautiful example of new construction on the old foundation? ek anya drushti se vichaar karen
 After the death of Pujya Dr
 G
, he was cremated in Reshim Bagh
 aaj vahaan unki samadhi bani he, jise ‘smriti mandir’ kehete hai
 Its exterior is like a temple; But there is nothing like puja, recitation, hour, bhog, aarti, prasad etc
 vahaan doctor ji bhavy pratimaa he, jo teen ore se khuli he
 It is clear that despite the importance of the person in the union, there is no place for person worship
 dwitiya sarasanghachaalak shri guruji ne apane dehanth se purv teen patr likhe the
 In the second letter itself, he had said not to build any memorial for him like Doctorji
 kaaryakartaaon ne unki ichha kaa sammaan karte hue smriti mandir ke saamne unka dah sanskaar kiya
 Today there is a small 'memento' in the form of yajna flame
 us par sant tukaraam kii ve panktiyaan utkeern hai, jinako uddhrut karte hue shri guruji ne apane tisare patr main sab swayamsevakon se kshamaa maangi thi
 Shri Balasaheb Deoras went one step further
 unhone kaaryakartaaon se pehle hi kah diya tha ki reshim baag ko hamen sarasanghachaalkon kaa shmashaan sthal nahin bananaa he
 So my last rites should be performed at the common crematorium
 balasahab kaa dehanth pune main hua; par unhone nagpur main apane jivan kaa kaaphi samay bitaayaa tha
 Many of his friends and relatives were there, who wanted to pay their last respects
 at: unke sharir ko nagpur laakar gangabai ghat par agni ko samarpit kiya gaya
 Like Balasaheb, Rajju Bhaiya also died in Pune
 unhone ek baar yah ichha vyakt kii thi ki unki mrit deh ko nagpur yaa dilli laane kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Where he dies, he should be cremated
 isi kaaran unka dah sanskaar pune main hua
 Sudarshan Ji died in Raipur
 unke parthiv sharir ko nagpur laayaa gaya
 Some Sangh activists took his body from a chariot to Ganga Bai Ghat from Reshimbagh for the last rites
 kisi samay sangh par maratha or brahmanvaadi hone kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa tha; par uttar pradesh ke pro rajendra singh or karnatakavasi sudarshan ji ke sarasanghachaalak banane ke baad in logon ke munh sil gayi
 After Mohan Bhagwat's Sarsanghchalak and Suresh Joshi became the Sarkaryavah, these radicals again shouted; But no one gave them grass anymore
 sab samaj chuke hai ki aise aarope bakawaas ke atirikt kuch nahin hai
 Those who call the Sangh as a fakir or the old-fashioned coupmund organization should study the development of the Sarsanghchalak tradition
 abhi sangh ne apni shatabdi nahin manaai he; par iske baad bhi is parampara main anek parivartan hue hai
 It is a symbol of the vibrancy of the Sangh and in it lies the secret of the Sangh's energy

 The cause was an accident

 The sheep used to cut the goats with ax or spade and used the fodder
 us samay gaay hi pramukh pashudhan tha
 Camels and buffaloes were the same
 us samay kahawat thi ki “ghodaan raaj or baldaan kheti” paala bahut hota tha, so gaayon ko paala daal dete or kadabi kaa pula tod dete
 Sieve was not cut at that time
 mere purvajon ke khet main chaar rajputon ke ladke aae or unhone khejadi kii tahaniyaan katkar apni bakriyon ko daal di
 Our ancestors had four sons
 sabase chota betaa bakriyaan lekar khet gaya hua tha
 He opposed them and singlehandedly crowded the four of them
 ek ladke ne uski gardan par kulhaade se waar kar diya or uski vahiin mrityu ho gai
 When he reported this to his father, he started walking with a stick
 un chaaron main se ek ladkaa to bhaag gaya shesh teen ko usne jaan se hi maar daalaa
 The Rajputs of the village prayed that these four fathers and sons would not kill us because all were 6 feet young
 anya gaanvon or aas-paas ke rajputon ko bulaakar lao or raat ko inke ghar ko aag lagaakar inhen jivit jalaado
 This information was given to him by a inspector
 so apana gaada or do belon main bartan bhande, auraten tathaa bakriyon ke chote bacchon tathaa gaayon ke chote bachhadon ko gaade main baitaakar yahan se chal pade or raat ko beri gram ke bid main aakar ruke
 Woke up in the morning and reached Katrathal

 In our village, Muslims broke the Buddhist temple and built a stronghold on the mound

 The Buddhist statues were inverted in the foundation of the citadel
 kalantar main shekhavaton ne garh par kabja kar liya tha
 Two Rajputs of our village were killed in the war between jaipur-bharatpur
 unki chhatariyaan aaj bhi gaanv main maujuud hai
 The two widows were thukranis and their servants
 : jyani gotra ke jat choudhary ne un thukraniyon ko bataaya ki ek aadmi apane parivaar evam pashuon sahit aayaa he to unhone kaha ki use yaheen basaao
 The Jats of the Khichad gotra settled in Katrathal 50 years before our ancestors
 unke paas hi hamaare purvajon ko basaa diya gaya

 The Maurya dynasty was a powerful and great dynasty of ancient India, the Kamboja dynasty
 isane 137 varsh bharat main rajya kiya
 Its establishment is credited to Chandragupta Maurya and his minister Kautilya, who defeated Emperor Ghanananda of the Nanda dynasty, who was the brother of Chandragupta Maurya
 maury samrajya ke vistaar evam use shaktishaalee banane kaa shrey samraat ashok ko jaataa he
 This empire started in the Magadha kingdom in the east from the plains of the river Ganges
 isaki rajdhani patliputra thi
 Chandragupta Maurya founded this empire in 322 BC and rapidly developed his empire towards the west
 usne kai chote chote kshetreey rajyon ke aapasi matbhedon kaa phayda uthaaya jo sikandar ke akraman ke baad paidaa ho gayi the
 By 316 BCE, the Maurya dynasty had captured the whole of North Western India
 chakravarti samraat ashok ke rajya main maury vansh kaa behad vistaar hua
 It was due to Emperor Ashoka that the Maurya Empire became the most famous and powerful worldwide
 325 isapurv main uttar pashchimi bharat sikandar ke kshatrapon kaa shashan tha
 When Alexander was invading Punjab, a Brahmin named Chanakya came to encourage Magadha for empire expansion
 us samay magadh acha khaasaa shaktishaalee tha tathaa uske padosi rajyon kii ankhon kaa kaanta
 But the then Emperor Ghananand of Magadha turned him down
 usne kaha ki tum ek pandit ho or apni chotii kaa hi dhyaan rakho "yuddh karnaa raja kaa kaam he tum pandit ho sirf panditai karo" tabhi se chanakya ne pratigya liya kii dhananand ko sabak sikhaa ke rahegaa| The Mauryas have been part of the ancient Kshatriya clan
 brahman sahitya,vishakhdutt krit mudrarakshas va justin ityadi unani sroton ke anusaar maury the maury ke utpatti ke vishay par itihaaskaaro ke ek mat nahi he kuch vidwaanon kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki chandragupta maury kii utpatti unki mata mura se mili he mura shabd kaa sansodhit shabd maury he, ve aise kabeeley the jo moron kaa paalan karte the
 But it also does not fit well
 For the first time in Indian history, the name of the mother was the son's descendant; Maurya was a powerful dynasty
 He inherited from his father
 The son's name is associated with the father, his origin is from the Vrishala dynasty
 It was done, but no proof of this is available in history, this is the only argument that no one in history has named her dynasty after mother's name, so some historians This is just conjecture
 
 Chandragupta was the son of the same Gana chief who was killed as a warrior in his childhood
 chandragupta main raja banane ke swaabhaavik gun the 'isi yogyata ko dekhte hue chanakya ne use apana shishy bana liya, evam ek sabal raashtra kii niv daali jo kii aaj tak ek adarsh he
 This was followed by a web of spies spread across India to collect secret information against the king as traitors - this was perhaps unprecedented in India
 ek baar aisa ho jane ke baad usne chandragupta ko unani kshatrapon ko maar bhagane ke liye taiyaar kiya
 In this task he was helped by a wide network of detectives
 magadh ke akraman main chanakya ne magadh main grihayuddh ko uksaaya
 His detectives bribed Nanda's officers and made him in his favor
 iske baad nand shaasha ne apana pad chhod diya or chanakya ko vijayshri praapt hui
 Nanda had to lead an exile life after which what happened to him is unknown
 chandragupta maury ne janata kaa vishwaas bhi jeeta or iske saath usko satta kaa adhikaar bhi mila
 At that time, Magadha was the most powerful state in India
 magadh par kabja hone ke baad chandragupta satta ke kendra par kaabiz ho chukaa tha
 Chandragupta started his conquest of western and southern India
 isaki jaankaree apratyaksh saakshyon se milti he
 The Junagadh inscription of Rudradaman states that a dam on the Sudarshan Lake was built by Pushyagupta for irrigation
 pushyagupt us samay ashok kaa prantiy rajyapal tha
 After liberating northwest India from Greek rule, its focus shifted to the south
 chandragupta ne sikandar ke senapati celukas ko 305 isapurv ke aasapaas haraaya tha
 The Greek accounts do not refer to this conquest, but this much says that a treaty was signed between Chandragupta and Seleucus according to which Seleucus gave the territories of Kandahar, Kabul, Herat and Baluchistan to Chandragupta
 iske saath hi chandragupta ne use 500 hathi bhent kiye the
 It is also said that Chandragupta established a matrimonial relationship with Seleucus' daughter
 celukas ne megasthaneez ko chandragupta ke darbar main rajdoot ke rup main bheja tha
 According to Plutarch, "sandrocottus had ascended the throne by that time, he had trampled and subjugated the whole of India with his army of 6,00,000 soldiers"
 yah tippanee thodi atishyokti kahi ja sakati he kyonki itnaa gyaat he ki kaveri nadi or uske dakshin ke kshetron main us samay cholon, pandyon, satyaputron tathaa keralaputron kaa shashan tha
 Ashoka's inscriptions have been found in Chittaladurg, Yeragudi and Maski in Karnataka
 uske shilalikhit dharmopadesh pratham tathaa trayodash main unke padosi chol, pandya tathaa anya rajyon kaa varnan miltaa he
 Since there is no information that Ashoka or his father Bindusar had fought any war in the south and conquered it, it is believed that Chandragupta had conquered them
 apane jivan ke uttarardh main usne jain dharm apana liya tha or singhaasana tyagkar karnataka ke shravanbelagola main apane guru jainmuni bhadrabahu ke saath sanyasi jivan vyateet karne laga tha
 After Chandragupta his son Bindusara was ruling but not much is known about him
 dakshin kii ore samrajya vistaar kaa shrey yada kada bindusaar ko diya jaataa he hanlanki uske vijay abhiyaan kaa koi sakshya nahin he
 According to the Jain tradition, his mother's name was Durdhar and Bindusara ruled in the Puranas for 25 years
 use amitraghaat kii oopaadhi bhi di jaati he jise unani granthon main amitrochatus kaa naam diya jaataa he
 Bindusar Azivak believed in Dharam
 usne ek unani shaasha en tiocus pratham se sukhi anjir, mithi sharaab va ek darshanik kii maang kii thi
 Emperor Ashoka is one of the greatest rulers not only of India but of the history of the world
 samrajya ke vistaar ke atirikt prashasan tathaa dharmik sahishnutaa ke kshetra main un kaa naam abbar jaise mahaan shaskaon ke saath liya jaataa he
 Although he has been a very powerful and great emperor than Akbar
 kai vidwaan to samraat ashok ko vishwa itihaas ke sabase safal shaasha bhi maanate hai
 During the days of his prince, he suppressed the rebellions of Ujjain and Taxila
 par kaling kii ladaai unke jivan main ek nirnaayak mode sabit hui or unka man yuddh main hue narsanhaar se glani se bhar gaya
 He embraced Buddhism and did many things to propagate it
 samraat ashok ko buddha dharm me upagupt ne dikshit kiya tha
 He held the title of Devanapriya, Priyadarshi
 samraat ashok ke shilaalekh tathaa shilotkeern upadesh bhartiya upmahadweep main jagah-jagah paae gaye hai
 He also sent his preachers abroad to preach Dhamma
 jin-jin deshon main prachaarak bheje gaye unamem syria tathaa pashchim asia kaa anteocus theos, misr kaa tolemi philadelus, macedoniya kaa antigons gonathas, sairin kaa megas tathaa epiras kaa alacgander shaamil the
 He sent his son Mahendra from the capital Pataliputra through the Sri Lanka waterway
 patna kaa aitihaasik mahendru ghat usee ke naam par namakrit he
 Emperor Ashoka maintained a large army even after the war broke out
 aisa videshi akraman se samrajya ke patan ko rokane ke liye aavashyak tha
 The capital of the Maurya Empire was Pataliputra
 iske atirikt samrajya ko prashasan ke liye chaar or praanton main baanta gaya tha
 Tausali was the capital of the eastern part and Suvarnagiri of the southern part
 isi prakaar uttari tathaa pashchimi bhaag kii rajdhani kramshah takshashila tathaa ujjain thi
 Apart from this, Samapa, Ishila and Kaushambi were also important cities
 rajya ke praantapalon kumaar hote the jo sthaneey praanton ke shaasha the
 There was a Council of Ministers and Mahamatyas in every province to help Kumar
 praant aage jilon main bante hote the
 Each district was divided into village groups
 pradeshik jila prashasan kaa pradhan hota tha
 The rope was used to measure the ground
 prashasan kii sabase choti ikai gaanv thi jiskaa pradhan graamic kehalaata tha
 Kautilya has written an entire chapter in economics about the administration of cities
 vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki us samay patliputra tathaa anya nagaron kaa prashasan is sinddhant ke anuroop hi rahaa hoga
 Megasthenes describes the administration of Pataliputra
 uske anusaar patliputra nagar kaa shashan ek nagar parishad dwaara kiya jaataa tha jisamen 30 sadsy the
 These thirty members were divided into six committees with five members each
 prayek samiti kaa kuch nishchit kaam hota tha
 The work of the first committee was related to industrial and artistic production
 iskaa kaam vetan nirdhaarit karnaa tathaa milawat rokna bhi tha
 The second committee looked into the affairs of people coming from outside in Pataliputra, especially foreigners
 teesri samiti kaa taalluk janm tathaa mrityu ke panjikaran se tha
 The fourth committee regulated trade and commerce
 iskaa kaam nirmit maal kii bikri tathaa panya par nazar rakhana tha
 The fifth was to keep an eye on the manufacture of goods, and the sixth work was to be done
 nagar parishad ke dwaara janakalyaan ke kaary karne ke liye vibhinn prakaar ke adhikari bhi niyukt kiye jate the, jaise - sadakon, bazaaron, chikitsaalayon, devalayon, shiksha-sansthaaon, jalaapurti, bandargahon kii marammat tathaa rakrakhaav kaa kaam karnaa
 The principal officer of the city was called Nagark
 kautilya ne nagar prashasan main kai vibhaagon kaa bhi ullekh kiya he jo nagar ke kai kaaryakalapon ko niyamit karte the, jaise - lekha vibhaag, rajasav vibhaag, khan tathaa khanij vibhaag, rath vibhaag, seemaa shulk or kar vibhaag
 Another thing which was unprecedented in India during the Maurya Empire was the Mauryo's intelligence trap
 us samay puure rajya main guptcharon kaa jaal bicha diya gaya tha jo rajya par kisi bahari akraman yaa aantarik vidroh kii khabar prashasan tathaa sena tak pahunchaate the
 National political unity was established in India only during the reign of Maurya dynasty
 maury prashasan main satta kaa sudrudh kendriyakaran tha parantu raja nirankush nahin hota tha
 During the Mauryan period, the Republic declined and the political system was strengthened
 kautilya ne rajya sapthank siddhanth nirdisht kiya tha, jinke aadhaar par maury prashasan or uski grih tathaa videsh niti sanchalit hoti thi - raja, amaatya janapad, durg, kosh, sena or, mitra
 One result of the establishment of such a large empire was that there was economic integration throughout the empire
 kisaanon ko sthaneey rup se koi kar nahin dena padataa tha, hanlanki iske badale unhen kadai se par vaazib maatra main kar kendriya adhikariyon ko dena padataa tha
 The currency of that time was gage

 The minimum salary was 60 panas while the maximum salary was 48,000 panas

 chhathi sadi isapurv main koi 62 sampradaayon ke astitv kaa pataa chalaa he jisamen buddha tathaa jain sampradaay kaa udai kaalaantar main anya kii apeksha adhik hua
 By the time of the Mauryas, Buddhist and Jain communities had developed
 udhar dakshin main shaiva tathaa vaishnav sampradaay bhi viksit ho rahe the
 Chandragupta Maurya had renounced his throne and converted to Jainism
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki chandragupta ne apane guru jainmuni bhadrabahu ke saath karnataka ke shravanbelagola main sanyasi ke rup main rahane laga tha
 In later inscriptions, it is found that Chandragupta died at the same place by fasting fast as a true devoted Jain
 vahaan paas main hi chandragiri naam kii pahari he jiskaa namaakaran shaayad chandragupta ke naam par hi kiya gaya tha
 Ashoka adopted Buddhism after the Kalinga war
 iske baad usne dhamm ke prachaar main apana dhyaan lagaaya
 Here Dhamma meant "moral principles", not religion or religion or religion
 us samay na to islam kaa janm hua tha or na hi isiyat kaa
 Therefore, those moral principles were not to oppose any religion outside, but to provide a moral law to man
 apane duusare shilaalekh main usne likhaa he - " dhamm kya he? alp dushkarm tathaa adhik satkarm
 Avoiding evils such as anger, cruelty, anger, pride and jealousy, and observance of virtues such as mercy, generosity, truth, restraint , simplicity, attachment to morality, purity of heart, and inner and external purity
 " After adopting Buddhism, he also tried to bring it into life
 usne shikaar karnaa or pashuon kii hatya chhod diya tathaa manushyon tathaa jaanwaron ke liye chikitsaalayon kii sthapana karai
 He generously donated to Brahmins and ascetics of various religious creeds
 iske alaava usne aaramgrih, evam dharmashala, kuen tathaa baavariyon kaa bhi nirmaan kaary karaayaa
 He appointed officers of the rank of Dharmamahatra whose work was to propagate Dhamma to the general public
 usne videshon main bhi apane prachaarak dal bheje
 Apart from neighboring countries, he also sent missionaries to Egypt, Syria, Macedonia Cyrene and Epirus
 halanki ashok ne khud buddha dharm apana liya tha par usne anya sampradaayon ke prati bhi aadar kaa bhav rakhaa tathaa unke viruddh kisi kaarywahi kii ullekh nahin miltaa he
 Shan Vistrath was in the Mauryan period sainya vyavastha chah samitiyon main vibhakt sainya vibhaag dwaara nirdisht thi

 The highest officer of military management was called Antapal

 According to Megasthenes, Chandragupta Maurya's army was invincible soldiers equipped with six lakh footmen, fifty thousand horsemen, nine thousand elephants and eight hundred chariots
 chandragupta maury ne shashan sanchaalan ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye chaar praanton main vibhajit kar diya tha jinhen chakra kaha jaataa tha
 The rule of these provinces was governed by the representative of the emperor

 These provinces were- praachi - patliputra Uttarapath - Taxila dakshinapath - suvarnagiri Avanti Nation - Ujjayini kaling - tosli The provinces were administered by officials named Dynastic Kumar

 Animals have many special qualities that differentiate them from other living things
 jantu eukeriotic or bahu koshikeey hote hai,, jo unhen jeevanu va adhikansh protista se alag karte hai
 They are heterotrophic, usually digesting food in an inner chamber, which makes them distinct from plants and algae, they can also be differentiated from plants, algae and fungi because they lack a hard cell wall
 All animals are moving, even if they are in a particular phase of life
 adhiktam jantuon main, bhrun ek blastula avasthaa se hokar gujarata he, yah jantuon kaa ek vibhedak gun he
 With few exceptions, most notably sponges and placozoa, the bodies of animals differentiate into different tissues

 jin jantuon main is prakaar kaa sanghathan hota he, unhen metazon kaha jaataa he, yaa tab eumetazon kaha jaataa he jab, purv kaa prayog saamaanya rup se jantuon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 All animals have eukaryotic cells, which are surrounded by extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoprotein
 yah khol, asthi or kantak jaisi sanranchanaaon ke nirmaan ke liye kelsikrut ho sakati hai
 During development, it forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move and reorganize, creating possible complex structures
 iske vipareet, anya bahukoshikeey jeev jaise paudhe or kavak kii koshikaayen koshika bhitti se ghiri hoti hai or is prakaar se pragatisheel vruddhi dwaara viksit hoti hai
 In addition, animal cells have a unique property of intercellular joints: tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes
 lagbhag sabhi jantu kisi prakaar ke langik prajnan kii prakriya se hokar guzarate hai: poliploid
 These have some specialized reproductive cells that undergo meiosis to produce small motile spermatozoa or large sedentary eggs

 Many animals also have asexual reproductive capacity
 yah anishekajanan ke dwaara ho saktaa he, jahaan bina nishechan ke anda bhrun main viksit ho jaataa he, kuch maamalon main vikhandeekaran ke dwaara bhi aisa sambhav he
 The zygote initially develops into a hollow sphere called blastula, it undergoes a process of rearrangement and differentiation of cells
 spanj main, blastula larva tair kar ek nae sthaan par chalaa jaataa he or ek nae spanj main viksit ho jaataa he
 In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complex rearrangements

 The selective pressure exerted on one another has led to an evolutionary race between prey and predator, resulting in many anti-predator adaptations
 zyaadaatar jantu apratyaksh rup se surya ke prakaash se hi urja praapt karte hai
 Plants use this energy to convert sunlight into simple sugars using a process called photosynthesis
 prakaash sanshleshan kii prakriya carbon dioxide or jal ke saath shuru hoti he, isamen surya ke prakaash kii urja ko rasinic urja main badal diya jaataa he, jo glucose ke bandhon main sanchit ho jaati he, is prakriya ke dauraan oxigen bhi mukt hoti he

 It either aids in the direct development of the animal or decomposes and is stored solar energy and thus the animal receives the energy required for movement

 The first fossils that represent animals appeared around the end of the Precambrian period, about 610 million years ago and are called the Ediacaran or Vendian biota

 Although some archaeologists and geologists suggest that animals appeared much earlier than previously thought, probably 1 billion years ago
 Fossil insignia such as trails and burrows found in the Tonian era indicate the presence of three-dimensional worms such as metazoa
 Likely earthworms would have been large and complex

 The diversity that currently informs the arrival of animals grazing as stromatolites increased diversity, shortly after the end of the Ordovician and Permian, causing large numbers of grazing marine animals to become extinct in their populations
 Shortly after the recovery, their number decreased

 However, a Fellow genomic study of 150 genes in 21 species in 2008 suggests that it is Tinophora or comb jelly that forms the basis of animals in at least 21 of those associations

 In other phyla, Tinophora and Nideria, including sea anemones, corals, and jellyfish, are radially symmetric, having a digestive chamber with a single pore, which serves both the mouth and the anus
 donon main spasht vibhedit utak hote hai, lekin ye angon main sangathit nahin hote hai
 There are only two main germ levels, ectoderm and endoderm, between which only the cells are scattered
 isi liye in jantuon ko kabhi kabhi diploblactic kaha jaataa he
 Small placozoa are similar, but do not have a permanent digestive chamber
 shesh jantu ek sangheey samooh banaate hai jo bailetria kehalaata he
 For the maximum part, they are bilateral symmetric and often have a specialized head consisting of food organs and sensory organs
 sharir tripaloblastic hota he, arthath, teenon janan paraten purna viksit hoti hai or utak vibhedit ang banaate hai
 The digestive chamber has two holes, a mouth and an anus, as well as an internal body cavity which is also called a celome or virtual body cavity
 in main prayek lakshan ke apwaad hai, haalaanki- vyask ekainodermet trigyat samamit hota he or vishisht paraseete jantuon main bahut hi sarlikrut shaareerik saranchana hoti he
 Genetic studies have changed our knowledge of relationships within the Bilateria to a great extent
 adhikansh do mukhya vanshawaliyon se sambandh rakhte hai: duterostome or protostome, jinamein shaamil hai ekadsojoa, platizoa or lophotrocojoa
 In addition to this, there are some small groups of bipartite asymmetrical organisms that appear to be diffusing to these main groups
 in main shaamil hai esolmorpha, rombojoa or orthonekatida
 Mixozoa, a unicellular parasite originally thought to be protozoan, are thought to have evolved from the Bilateria
 duterostome anya bailetria, protostome se kai prakaar se bhinn hai
 In both cases a complete digestive tract is found
 haalanki, protostome main praarambhik chhidr muh main viksit hota he or guda alag se viksit hoti he
 This is the reverse in deuterostomes
 adhikansh protostome main, koshikaayen saadhaaran rup se gestrula ke aantarik bhaag main bhar jaati hai or madhya janan str banaati hai, yah shaijosilas vikaas kehalaata he, lekin duterostome main yah antar janan str ke antervalan se banataa he, jise entrocelic pouching kaha jaataa he
 Deuterostomes have a dorsal nerve cord rather than a ventral and their embryos undergo a different cleavage
 yah sab vivaran bataata he ki duterostome or protostome alag ek sangheey str hai
 The major associations of deuterostomes are echinodermata and chordata
 pehle vaala trigyat samamit he or vishesh rup se samudri he, jaise tara machhlee, samudri archin or samudri khiraa
 The second one consists mainly of vertebrate organisms in which the spinal cord is found
 in main shaamil hai machhlee, ubhaychar, reptiles, pakshi or standhari
 Apart from these, deuterostomes also include Hemicordetta and Akon worms
 haalaanki ve vartmaan main mukhyatah nahin paae jate hai, mahatvapurn jeevashmi pramaan inase sambandh rakhte hai
 Chatognatha or arrow worms may also be deuterostomes, but more recent studies show their association with protostomes
 ekadsojoa protostome hai, jinka yah naam paritvakabhavan yaa nirmochan ke dwaara vruddhi ke vishesh lakshan ke aadhaar par diya gaya he
 The largest animal union, Arthropoda, belongs to them, including worms, spiders, crabs and their close relatives
 in sabhi main sharir khandon main vibhajit hota he or praroopik taur par inamen yugmit upang paae jate hai
 The two smaller phyla Onychophora and Tardigreda are closely related to Arthropoda and have similar traits
 ekadsojoa main nimetoda yaa gol krimi aate hai, yah doosraa sabase bada jantu sangh he
 Roundworms are usually micro-organisms and are produced in almost every environment where there is water
 kai mahatvapurn paraseete hai
 The smaller associations related to these are the Nematomorpha or Ashvarom worm and the Kinorhinka, Priapulida and Loricifera
 in samoohon kaa laghukrit dehguha hoti he, jo abhaasi deh guha kehalaati he
 The remaining two groups of protostomes are sometimes placed along the spiral, as embryonic development occurs in both with spiral cleavage
 platizoa main shaamil he sangh platihelminthij, chapate krimi
 Originally they were thought to be the most primitive types of bipartite, but they are now thought to have evolved from more complex ancestors
 is samooh main kai paraseete shaamil hai, jaise fluke or feeta krimi
 Flatworms are angular, lacking a body cavity, as in their closest relative, the microbe Gastrotrica
 platizoa ke anya sangh zyaadaatar sookshm darsheey or abhaasi dehguha se yukt hote hai
 The most prominent are rotifera or rotifers, which are common in aquatic environments
