 Newton was made a judge of the peace and between June 1698 and Christmas 1699, he conducted 200 trials of witnesses, informers and suspects
 newton ne apni patibaddhta ko jeeta or farvari 1699 main unke paas das kaidi rihaai kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 Newton had a case against William Chaloner as the king's lawyer
 chaloner kii yojana thi catholic ke jaali shadyantr ko tay karnaa or phir abhaage shadyantrakaari main badal dena jisko vah bandhak bana letaa tha
 Chaloner made himself a rich enough gentleman
 sansad main arji dete hue chalonor ne taksaal main nakli sikke banane ke liye upkaran bhi uplabdh karaaye
 usne prastaav diya ki use taksaal kii prakriyaaon kaa nirikshan karne kii anumati di jaae taaki vah isamen sudhaar ke liye kuch kar sake
 He petitioned the Parliament to accept his plan for the minting of coins so that counterfeiting could not be committed, while at the same time forged coins appeared
 newton ne chalonor par jaalsaji kaa pareekshan kiya or sitambar 1697 main use new get jail main bhej diya
 But Chaloner had friends in high places, who helped him with his release
 newton ne duusari baar nirnaayak saboot ke saath us par parikshan kiya
 Chaloner was found guilty of high treason and was hanged and buried on 23 March 1699 at Tiburon Gallows
 newton ke pehla niyam ke anusaar ek vastu jo sthiravastha main he vah sthir hi bani rahegi or ek vastu jo samaan gati kii avasthaa main he vah samaan gati ke saath usee disha main gati karti rahegi jab tak us par koi bahari bal kaary nahin karata he
 According to Newton's second law, the force exerted on an object is f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} \ vec {, its momentum over time p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} \ vec { Is equal to the rate of change in
 ganitiya rup main ise nimnanusaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he Since the second law applies to an object of constant mass, the first term vanishes and by substitution using the definition of acceleration, the equation can be written as follows
 pehla or doosraa niyam arastu kii bhautikee ko todane kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, jisamen aisa mana jaataa tha ki gati ko banaaye rakhane ke liye ek bal jaruri he
 They are a motive of the pace of the system in the state to change the state that only one power is needed
 newton ke sammaan main bal kii SI ikai kaa naam newton rakhaa gaya he
 According to Newton's third law, every action has an equal and opposite reaction
 iskaa arth yah he ki jab bhi ek vastu kisi duusari vastu par ek bal lagaati he tab duusari vastu vipareet disha main pehali vastu par utana hi bal lagati he
 a common example of this is two ice skates move opposite to each other and then slide in opposite directions
 ek anya udhaaharan he bandook kaa peeche kii or dhakka mahasoos karnaa, jisamen bandook ke dwaara goli ko daagne ke liye us par lagaaya gaya bal, ek baraabar or vipareet bal bandook par lagaataa he jise goli chalaane vaala mahasoos karata he
 Since the objects in question do not necessarily have the same mass, the resulting acceleration of the two objects may be different
 arestu ke vipareet, newton kii bhautikee saarvatrik ho gayi he
 For example, the second law also applies to planets and a falling stone
 duusare niyam kii sadish prakruti bal kii disha or vastu ke samveg main parivartan ke prakaar ke bich ek jyamitiya sambandh sthapit karti he
 Before Newton, it was generally believed that for a planet rotating around the Sun, a forward force was required which caused it to move
 newton ne darshaya ki is ke bajaay surya kaa andar kii or ek aakarshan bal aavashyak hota he
 Even several decades after the publication of the Principia, this idea was not universally accepted
 or kai vaigyanikon ne descartes ke vortices ke siddhant ko variyata di
 Newton himself often told a story that upon seeing a falling apple from a tree, he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravity
 baad main vyangy karne ke liye aise cartoon banaaye gaye jinamein seb ko newton ke sar par girte hue bataaya gaya or yah darshaya gaya ki isi ke prabhaav ne kisi tarah se newton ko gurutv ke bal se parichit karaayaa
 unki pustikaon se gyaat hua ki 1660 ke antim samay main newton kaa yah vichaar tha ki sthaliy gurutv kaa vistaar hota he, yah chandramaa ke varg vyutkramanupati hota he; haalaanki purna siddhant ko viksit karne main unhen do dashak kaa samay laga
 John Kanaduyt, who was Newton's associate at the Royal Mint and also the husband of Newton's niece, described the incident when he wrote about Newton's life: 1666 main ve cambridge se phir se sevanivrutt ho gaye or apni maa ke paas linkanshair chale gaye
 As he was walking in a garden, he got an idea that the power of gravity is not limited to a certain distance from the earth, but this power can extend far beyond what was previously thought
 unhone apane aap se kaha ki kya aisa utana upar bhi hoga jitna upar chaand he or yadi aisa he to, yah uski gati ko prabhavit karegaa or sambhavatya use uski kaksha main banaaye rakhega, ve jo gananaa kar rahe the, is tark kaa kya prabhaav hua
 The question was not about the existence of gravity, but whether this force is so wide that it is responsible for keeping the moon in its orbit
 newton ne darshaya ki yadi bal duuri ke varg vyutkram main kam hota he to, chandramaa kii kakshiya avadhi kii gananaa kii ja sakati he or acha parinaam praapt ho saktaa he
 He speculated that this force is responsible for other orbital motion and hence gave it the name of universal gravitation
 ek samakaleen lekhak, wiliam stukele, sar ijac newton kii zindagi ko apane samaran main ricord karte hai, ve 15 april 1726 ko kencinghton main newton ke saath hui baatcheet ko yaad karte hai, jab newton ne zikr kiya ki "unke dimag main gurutv kaa vichaar pehle kab aayaa
 This happened because of an apple falling while he was sitting in meditation posture
 kyon yah seb hameshaa bhoomi ke saapeksh lambavat main hi kyon girtaa he? aisa unhone apane aap main sochaa
 Why it does not move to the side or up, but always falls towards the center of the earth
 " isi prakaar ke shabdon main, volter mahakavy kavita par niabandh main likhaa, "sar ijac newton kaa apane baganon main gum rahe the, ped se girte hue ek seb ko dekh kar, unhone gurutvkarshan kii pranali ke bare main pehali baar sochaa
 The various trees are claimed to be "that" apple tree which Newton has described
 di kings skool, grantham daawa karata he ki yah ped skool ke dwaara kharid liya gaya tha, kuch saalon baad ise jad sahit laakar pradhanadhyaapak ke bageeche main laga diya gaya
 The current staff at the National Trust, which owns Woolstrop Manor, disputs this, and claims that the tree is present in their garden about which Newton talked
 mul vriksh kaa vanshaj trinity college, cambridge ke mukhya dwaar ke baahar uga hua dekha ja saktaa he, yah us kamare ke neeche he jisamen newton padhai ke samay rahata tha

 Newcastle United continued to win league championships throughout the 1900s as well, winning them three times in 1905, 1907 and 1909
 The club continued its winning streak in cup competitions and reached the final stages of the 5 FA Cup in 7 years, joining the club in the final stages of 1905, 1906, 1908, 1910 and 1911
 haalanki club in sabhi final charnon main se ek hi jeet sakaa, yah jeet 1910 ke final main bransale ke vipareet thi jo gudison park main khelaa gaya ek riple tha
 Even during this period, however, a particularly disappointing thing was that the team lost 9–1 to their biggest rival, Sunderland, in the 1908–09 season, Sunderland still sees this result as a record for their victory

 iske baad newcastle ekaisi team ban gayi thi jo bahut hi asthir or purvanumaan se pare thi or jo sadaiv hi acchhee se acchhee team ko haraane main samarth thi lekin ise kabhi bhi thik se apni shakti kaa anubhav nahin ho paaya
 Harvey's team was selected for Europe for the first time in 1968, and the following year he surprised everyone by winning the inter-cities Fairs Cup, with Sporting on his way to victory before winning a landslide win against Ujpest of Hungary in the final
 Libson was defeated by Feyenoord, Real Zaragoza and Rangers

 In the years following the European conquest, Harvey brought a series of talented entertainers which made the Newcastle group very happy
 Players such as John Tudor, Jimmy Smith, Tony Green, Terry Hibbit and especially striker Malcom Macdonald all became favorites of their supporters
 melcom mcdonald ko upnaam 'supermack' diya gaya tha, vah newcastle ke sabase lokapriy khilaadiyon main se ek the or aaj tak bhi samarthak unka bahut sammaan karte hai
 He was a very skilled goalscorer who led United's team to Wembley twice in 1974 and 1976 against Liverpool in the FA Cup and against Manchester City in the League Cup but on every occasion the Newcastle Trophy was again restored to Tyneside Failed to bring back
 iske sthaan par ek choti santvanaa yah rahi thi ki 1974 or 1975 main texaco cap main team ko ek ke baad ek safalataa mili thi
 Newcastle had declined dramatically since the early 1980s and now reached the second tier
 harvey ke sthaan par swami ke rup main gaurden lee aa gayi the phir bahut zaldi unke sthaan par bhi richard dinnis aa gaye or richard denis ke baad bill mcgary aa gaye
 But it was Arthur Cox who brought Newcastle back into the first division with players such as Peter Beardsley, Chris Waddle, Terry mcdermott and former England captain Kevin Keegan, who were the base of the team
 Newcastle had been at the peak for a long time, including managers such as Jack Charlton, Willie mcfaul and Jim Smith, and players such as Paul Geskoign before the team's performance collapsed in 1989
 baad main, kigan oswaldo ardels ke sthaan par 1992 main ek laghukaalin sanvida par manager ke rup main tinside laut aaye, unhone pehle yah daawa kiya tha ki maatr yahi ek aisa kaam he jo unhen footbal main waapas aane ke liye prerit kar saktaa he
 The Newcastle team struggled at the wrong end of the second division; Sir John Hall was doing everything except to take control of the club and to save Newcastle from reaching the third tier for the first time in its history, they needed a small spell
 apane hi kshetra main portsmouth or bahya kshetron main licester city ke viruddh donon lig game ke final charan main jeetne se unka bachanaa sunishchit ho gaya, licester se unki jeet antim kshan main kiye gaye gol se hui thi, haalanki jais baad main spasht ho gaya, yadi newcastle licester se parajeet ho jaataa to bhi vah batch jaataa
 The 1992–93 season brought a dramatic twist to the club's fortunes
 grimsbai toun ke viruddh apane hi kshetra main 1-0 se haarane se purv team ne apane pehle 11 lig game main jeet hasil kii or unka yah pradarshan english lig ke 13 lagaataar jeet darj karne se sirf do game peeche rah gaya
 Coincidentally, Newcastle became first-class winners with a 2–0 away win in Grimsby on 4 May 1993, playing football in an aggressive style and were promoted to the Premier League
 kigan ke samay main, newcastle kii jeet kaa silsilaa aage badhata rahaa, 1993-94 ke satr main unhone apni aakraamak style or tritiy sthaan praapt kar sabko prabhavit kiya, yah ucch shikhar par unki vaapasi kaa pehla satr tha
 Keegan's aggressive game theory led to Newcastle receiving "the Entertainers" title by Sky Television
 The title made further headlines through a 3–0 win against Liverpool
 iske agle satr main newcastle ne apane sheersh score karne vaale khilaadi andrew kol kaa sauda menchester united ke saath kar liya or is satr ke pratham ardhansh main adhikansh samay tak suchi main aage rahane ke baad bhi ant main unhen chhathvaan sthaan mila

 us satr kaa ek match vishesh rup se alag rahaa, yah 3 april 1996 ko hua liverpool ko 4-3 se haraane vaala match tha; april 2003 main is match ko premier lig ke dasven satr ke award samaaroh main "match of da dicade" kaa naam diya gaya
 The disappointment of missing the title on 30 July 1996 was somewhat mitigated when the club contracted Ellen Shearer for £ 15 million, the then world-class remuneration
 1996-97 ke satr main ek baar phir newcastle sambhavit vijeta manchester united ko saint james park main 5-0 se haraane ke baavjood bhi duusare sthaan par hi rahaa
 is satr main club bhi yuiefee cap ke quarter final main pahunch gaya tha
 The shocking resignation of Keegan in early January 1997 led to a lot of deep dissatisfaction and confusion among supporters, though many believed it had started since the 1995 / 96 season of the title win
 It had already happened
 keni delgish unke uttaradhikari ke rup main aaye or lig main doosraa sthaan paane main club kaa netritv kiya, unhone kigan dwaara banaaye gayi team main koi parivartan nahin kiya
 However, his fortunes were soon reversed due to the injuries suffered by the players and the market transfer of the 1997–98 season, as well as new players who were not able to match the players who were contracted
 , Thus the club finished 11th in the league and failed to win the FA Cup final
 Delgish left at the beginning of the 1998–99 season and after that, Rude Gullit took over the reins of the team
 After contracting the players, the club once again reached the final of the FA Cup but failed to win
 Shortly the following season, Gullit had differences with the team and with chairman Freddie Shepherd, which led to the manager publicly apologizing and stating that he had no feud with captain Ellen Shearer
 gulit ne satr 1999 / 2000 main 8 match purv club ko chhod diya
 Former England captain Bobby Robson was appointed as the new manager

 Such good performances ensured the club's presence in the Premier League in Robson's first season, although the team could not be selected for Europe the following season
 The 2001–02 season, however, saw some challenges and after finishing fourth, Newcastle qualified for the Champions League

 Initially the director of the Youth Academy, Glenn Roeder, temporarily replaced Sounes
 unke netritv main khele gaye pehle match main ellen shieror ne jeki milbern ko club ke sarvaadhik gol karne vaale khilaadi ke sthaan se hataa kar swayan unka sthaan le liya
 In just three-and-a-half months, Roeder was eventually made the team's full-time manager as his leadership moved the team from 15th to 7th place
 yogadan or puraskaron se anugrihit hokar shieror ne 2005-06 ke satr ke ant main avkaash le liya, unhone ab tak club ke liye kul 206 gol kiye the
 Even after a good end to the 2005–06 season, Roeder's fortunes were overturned in the 2006–07 season, due to the event that he relied on youth academy players to compete in the Premier League and Europe
 Having done so and to this day is seen as the worst loss of senior players in the history of the club, he left the club on 6 May 2007 by mutual consent
 sam alrdise ko 15 may ko roder ke sthaan par manager ke rup main niyukt kiya gaya or baad main yah adhyaksh ke rup main fredy shefrd dwaara kiya gaya antim kaary ban gaya, jinhone 7 june ko anichhaapurvak apane antim share club main mike eshle ko bech die or unka sthaan nae adhyaksh kris mort ne le liya

 ab mai yahi karne kaa prayaas kar rahaa hum
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki unhone club ko kharidne main or karjon ko nipataane main kul 244 million pound kharch kiye the

 Abul Muzaffar Muhiuddin Muhammad Aurangzeb Alamgir, commonly known as Aurangzeb or Alamgir, was the sixth Mughal ruler to rule India
 uskaa shashan 1658 se lekar 1707 main uski mrityu hone tak chalaa
 Aurangzeb ruled the Indian subcontinent for more than half a century
 wo akbar ke baad sabase zyada samay tak shashan karne vaala mogul shaasha tha
 During his lifetime he tried his best to expand the Mughal Empire in Southern India, but after his death, the Mughal Empire started shrinking
 aurangzeb ke shashan main mogul samrajya apane vistaar ke charmotkarsh par pahunchaa
 He was perhaps the wealthiest and sober person of his time, who through his conquests in South India, spread the Mughal Empire over twelve and a half million square miles and ruled over 150 million people, 1 / 4 of the world's population
 aurangzeb ne puure samrajya par fatwa-e-alamgiri lagu kiya or kuch samay ke liye gair-muslimon par atirikt kar bhi lagaaya
 He was the first Muslim ruler to apply Sharia to non-muslim people
 mogul shasankaal main unke shashan kaal main uske darbariyon main sabase zyada hindu the
 And Tegh Bahadur, the Guru of the Sikhs, along with Darashikoh, was given the death penalty in a crime of rebellion
 aurangzeb kaa janm 3 navambar 1618 ko dahod, gujarat main hua tha
 He was the sixth child of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal and the third son
 uske pita us samay gujarat ke soobedaar the
 When the rebellion by his father failed in June 1626, Aurangzeb and his brother Dara Shukoh were held hostage by Noor Jahan in the Lahore court of his grandfather Jahangir
 26 farvari 1628 ko jab shahjahan ko mogul samraat ghoshit kiya gaya tab aurangzeb agra kile main apane mata pita ke saath rahane ke liye waapas lautaa
 It was here that Aurangzeb received his formal education in Arabic and Persian
 mogul prathaon ke anusaar, shahjahan ne 1634 main shahzada aurangzeb ko dakkan kaa soobedaar niyukt kiya
 Aurangzeb went to Kirkee whose name was changed to Aurangabad
 1637 main usne rabia durrani se shaadi kii
 Here Shahjahan started handing over the work of the Mughal court to his son Dara Shikoh
 1644 main aurangzeb kii bahan ek durghatana main jalakar mar gai
 Aurangzeb came to Agra three weeks after the incident, which caused his father Shah Jahan immense anger
 usne aurangzeb ko dakkan ke soobedaar ke ohade se barkhaast kar diya
 Aurangzeb could not come to the court for 7 months
 baad main shahjahan ne use gujarat kaa soobedaar banaaya
 Aurangzeb ruled smoothly and received the title of the same, he was made the governor of Badakhshan and Balkh region
 iske baad use multan or sindh kaa bhi governor banaaya gaya
 During this time he kept fighting with the Persians of Persia for control over Kandahar, but if he got anything other than defeat, it was his father's neglect
 1652 main use dakkan kaa soobedaar fir se banaaya gaya
 He fought against Golconda and Bijapur and at the decisive moment Shah Jahan withdrew the army
 isse aurangzeb ko bahut thes pahaunchi kyonki shahjahan aisa uske bhai daara shikoh ke kehane par kar rahaa tha
 In 1652, Shah Jahan fell ill and it seemed that Shah Jahan would die
 daara shukoh, shah suja or aurangzeb main satta sangharsh chalane laga
 Shah Suza, who had declared himself as the Governor of Bengal, had to go to the Arakan region of Burma, and in 1659 Aurangzeb, after arresting Shah Jahan at the Taj Mahal for the royal treasury, declared himself king
 daara shikoh ko rajdroh ke zurm main phaansi de di gai
 Aurangzeb never spent the royal treasury on his own
 mogul, khaaskar akbar ke baad se, gair-muslimon par udaar rahe the lekin aurangzeb unke thik ulat tha
 Aurangzeb resumed Jiziya, which Akbar had finished
 usne kashmiri brahmanon ko islam qabool karne par majaboor kiya
 The Kashmiri Brahmins sought help from Tegh Bahadur, the ninth Guru of the Sikhs
 teg bahadur ne iskaa virodh kiya to aurangzeb ne unhen faansee par lataka diya
 Sikhs still remember this day in their festivals
 aurangzeb ke shashan kaal main yuddh-vidroh-daman-chadhaai ityadi kaa tantaa laga rahaa
 The number and strength of the Sikhs in the West was increasing
 dakshin main bijapur or golkunda ko antat usne haraa diya par is bich shivaji kii maratha sena ne unako naak main dam kar diya
 Shivaji was arrested by Aurangzeb, but when Shivaji and Sambhaji escaped, it became a matter of great concern for him
 aakhir shivaji maharaja ne aurangzeb ko haraaya or bharat main maratha ne puure desh main apni takat badhai shivaji kii mrityu ke baad bhi maraathon ne aurangzeb ko pareshaan kiya
 Meanwhile, the Rajputs turned against him due to the policy of converting Hindus to Islam and they revolted soon after he died in 1707
 aurangzeb ke prashasan main duusare mughal badshaah se zyada hindu niyukt the or shivaji bhi inamen shaamil the
 It is a well-known fact about Mughal history that in comparison to other kings, Aurangzeb's reign was more part of Hindu administration
 aitihaasik tathy bataate hai ki aurangzeb ke pita shahjahan ke shasankaal main sena ke vibhinn padon, darbar ke duusare ahm padon or vibhinn bhugolic prashasnic ikaayiyon main hinduon kii taadaad 24 fisadi thi jo aurangzeb ke samay main 33 fisadi tak ho gai thi
 In the words of m Athar Ali, this fact is the strongest evidence against the notion that the emperor sided with the Hindu mansabdars
 aurangzeb kii sena main varisht padon par badi sankhya main rajput niyukt the
 Aurangzeb's attack against the Marathas and the Sikhs is viewed through religious spectacles but it is ignored when concluding that the Mughal army was often commanded by a Rajput commander in the war zone
 itihaaskaar yadunath sarkaar likhte hai ki ek samay khud shivaji bhi aurangzeb kii sena main manasabadaar the
 It is said that he was supposed to be the head of the Mughal Sultanate in South India but failed to realize his military prowess, Aurangzeb did not approve this appointment
 aurangzeb pavitra jivan vyateet karata tha
 In his personal life he was an ideal man
 vah un sab durgunon se sarvatra mukt tha, jo asia ke raajaaon main samanytah the
 He lived the Yeti-life
 khaane-pine, vesh-bhusha or jivan kii anya sabhi-suvidhaon main vah sanyam baratata tha
 While busy with the heavy work of administration, he used to take time to earn some money by copying the Quran and sealing the caps to meet his needs
 aurangzeb hi nahin sabhi madhyakaalin bharat ke tamaam muslim baadshahon ke bare main ek baat yah bhi kahi jaati he ki unamem se koi bhartiya nahin tha
 At one level, this is childish and meaningless because the concept of nation did not exist anywhere in 17th century India
 haalanki iske baad bhi yah baat kam se kam aurangzeb ke maamle main lagu nahin hoti
 This Mughal emperor was a staunch upper-class Hindustani
 iskaa sidhaa tark yahi he ki uskaa janm gujarat ke dahod main hua tha or uskaa paalan poshan ucchwargeey hindustani pariwaron ke bacchon kii tarah hi hua
 The Braj language and its literature were always patronized throughout the Mughal period and this tradition continued even during the rule of Aurangzeb
 colombia uniwarsity se judi itihaaskaar ellison bush bataati hai ki aurangzeb ke darbar main braj ko protsaahan dene vaala maahaul tha
 The king's son Azam Shah had a keen interest in Braj poetry
 braj sahitya ke kuch bade naamon jaise mahakavi dev ko usne sangrakshan diya tha
 Vrind, another great poet of the same language, was also employed in Aurangzeb's administration
 mughalkaal main darbar kii aadhikarik lekhan bhashaa farsi thi lekin aurangzeb kaa shashan aane se pehle hi badshaah se lekar darbariyon tak ke bich prachlit bhashaa hindi-urdu ho chuki thi
 This can also be understood from Aurangzeb's letter he wrote to his 47-year-old son Azam Shah
 badshaah ne apane bete ko ek kila bhent kiya tha or is maukey par nagaade bajwane kaa aadesh diya
 In a letter to Azam Shah, Aurangzeb has written that when he was a child, he loved the voice of the drums and often said, 'babaji dhan-dhan!' It can be said from this example that Aurangzeb's son used to talk to his father in the then prevalent Hindi
 samraat aurangzeb ne islam dharm ke mahatv ko sweekaarte hue ‘quran’ ko apane shashan kaa aadhaar banaaya
 He prohibited kalma khudvana on coins, celebrating the festival of nauroz, cultivating hemp, singing and playing etc

 apane shashan kaal ke 11 varsh main ‘jharokha darshan’, 12wein varsh main ‘tuladaan pratha’ par pratibandh laga diya, 1668 i
 main hindu tyohaaron par pratibandh laga diya
 In 1699 AD, he ordered the destruction of Hindu temples
 bade-bade nagaron main aurangzeb dwaara ‘muhatsib’ ko niyukt kiya gaya
 In 1669, Aurangzeb broke the 'vishwanath Temple' of Benares and the 'keshav Rai Mandir' of Mathura
 usne sharia ke viruddh liye jane vaale lagbhag 80 karon ko samaapt karvaa diya
 These included local taxes called ‘raidari’ and ‘pandari’ also known as ‘abwab’
 aurangzeb ‘daarul herb’ ko ‘daarul islam’ main parivartit karne ko apana mahatvapurn lakshya maanata tha
 In Aurangzeb's time, pilgrims coming to Brij were heavily taxed, Jiziya tax was re-imposed and Hindus were converted to Muslims
 us samay ke kaviyon kii rachanaaon main aurangzeb ke atyaacharon kaa ullekh he
 The Jaziya tax levied by Aurangzeb was at that time
 akbar ne jajia kar ko samaapt kar diya tha, lekin aurangzeb ke samay yah dobaaraa lagu kiya gaya
 Jaziya was different from normal taxes that non-muslims had to pay
 iske teen str the or iskaa nirdhaaran sambandhit vyakti kii aamadani se hota tha
 There were some exceptions to this tax
 garibon, berozegaron or shaareerik rup se ashakt log iske daayre main nahin aate the
 Apart from these, Brahmins and government officials who were at the top of the varna system of Hindus were also out of it
 musalamaanon ke upar lagane vaala aisa hi dharmik kar jakaat tha jo har amir musalmaan ke liye dena zaruri tha 
 Jaziya was certainly a biased tax system on the norms of modern values
 aadhunik raashtra, dharm or jati ke aadhaar par is tarah kaa bhed nahin kar sakate
 That is why when we look at the 17th century system on the scale of modern nations, it may seem very chaotic, but it was not so during Aurangzeb
 us daur main iske duusare udhaaharan bhi milte hai
 As the Marathas evicted the Mughals from a large part of the south
 unki kar vyavastha bhi takreeban isi str kii pakshpaati thi
 They used to collect zakat from Muslims and the Hindu population was out of any such tax system
 aurangzeb ne jitne mandir tudwaaye, usase kahin zyada banawaye the
 According to the famous historian Richard Eaton, demolition of temples was a rare occurrence in the Mughal period and whenever it happened it was political because of it
 iton ke mutabik vahi mandir tode gaye jinamein vidrohiyon ko sharan milti thi yaa jinaki madad se badshaah ke khilaaf sajeesh rachi jaati thi
 At that time there was no religious purpose to break the temple
 is maamle main kukhyat kaha jane vaala aurangzeb bhi sultanate ke isi niyam par chalaa
 Examples of temple demolition during his reign are very rare and there are political reasons at his root
 udhaaharan ke liye aurangzeb ne dakshin bharat main kabhi-bhi mandiron ko nishaanaa nahin banaaya jabaki uske shasankaal main zyaadaatar sena yaheen tainaat thi
 He definitely attacked some temples in North India like Keshav Rai temple in Mathura but the reason was not religious
 mathura ke jaaton ne sultanate ke khilaaf vidroh kiya tha isliye yah hamalaa kiya gaya
 In contrast, Aurangzeb also patronized temples for reasons
 yah uski un hinduon ko bhent thi jo badshaah ke vafaadaar the
 Historian Catherine Butler of King's College, London even says that Aurangzeb had built more temples than he broke
 catherine frank, em athar ali or jilaluddin jaise vidwaan is taraf bhi ishaara karte hai ki aurangzeb ne kai hindu mandiron ko anudaan diya tha jinamein banaras kaa jangam baadi math, chitrakoot kaa balaji mandir, elahabaad kaa someshwar nath mahadev mandir or guwahati kaa umanand mandir sabase jane-pahachaane naam hai
 In the period in the Mughal period, the talk of breaking the temples is so much in vogue, there is no special mention of this in the Hindus
 tark diya ja saktaa he ki us daur main aisa karnaa khatre se khaali nahin rahaa hoga, lekin 18veen shatabdi main jab sultanate khatm ho gai tab bhi is baat kaa kahin zikr nahin miltaa
 In the past, the issue of the demolition of Hindu temples by Mughal rulers became hot in India in the 1980s-90s
 aurangzeb ko kattarpanthi sabit karne kii koshish main ek bada tark yah bhi diya jaataa he ki usne sangeet par pratibandh laga diya tha, lekin yah baat bhi sahi nahin he
 Catherine explains that music was not banned in her court even in the Sultanate
 badshaah ne jis din rajgaddi sanbhali thi, har saal us din utsav main khub naach-gaanaa hota tha
 Some Dhrupadas include the name Aurangzeb, which suggests that music was patronized during his reign
 kuch aitihaasik tathy is baat kii taraf bhi ishaara karte hai ki vah khud sangeet kaa acha jaankaar tha
 In mirat-e-alam, Bakhtawar Khan wrote that the emperor had knowledge like musical legends
 mughal vidwaan fakirullah ne raag darpan naam ke dastavej main aurangzeb ke pasandida gayakon or vaadakon ke naam darj kiye hai
 Aurangzeb was loved by his sons Azam Shah and history tells that Shah had become an accomplished musician during his father's lifetime
 aurangzeb ke shasankaal main sangeet ke phalne-phoolne kii baat karte hue catherine likhti hai, ‘500 saal ke puure mughalkaal kii tulana main aurangzeb ke samay farsi main sangeet par sabase zyada tikaa likhi gayi
 However, it is true that towards the end of his life, Aurangzeb became more religious and kept away from music and music
 lekin upar hamane jin baton kaa zikr kiya he use dekhte hue yah mana ja saktaa he ki usne kabhi apni nijee ichha ko sultanate kii aadhikarik niti nahin banaaya
 In the late Aurangzeb, the Marathas had increased in strength in the south
 unhen dabaane main shahi sena ko safalataa nahin mil rahi thi
 Therefore, in 1683 Aurangzeb himself went south with the army
 vah rajdhani se dur rahata hua, apane shashan−kaal ke lagbhag antim 25 varsh tak usee abhiyaan main rahaa
 After ruling for 50 years, he died in Ahmednagar in the south on 3 March 1707 AD

 The film begins with Reshma leaving Chennai the day before her wedding
 vah ek film main kirdaar paane ke liye bahut prayaas karti he parantu film kaa paatr nirdeshak use bekaar or anakarshith kah kar beizzat kar detaa he
 Reshma Punh convincingly goes to convince her and finally the car acquires the role of a side dancer
 shooting shuru hote hi vah turant mukhya screen par chaabuk ke saath ashleel or uttejnaa purna bhaavon ke saath nrity karnaa shuru kar detii he
 His action makes film director Abraham angry thinking that the art of making his film should be seen on the screen and not the provocative and vulgar content
 vah reshma ke nrity kaa puraa hissaa film se kaat detaa he
 The film gets beat up at the box office, which makes producer Selva Ganesh quite angry and Reshma gets together and later gives her a song in her upcoming film and suggests that she should henceforth name her Silk
 apane pehle seen main silk sooryakanth ko dekh kar mantrmugdh ho kar sharma jaati he jisase pehla seen bekaar hojaataa he or sooryakanth naaraaz hokar nikal jaataa he
 Silk convinces her by attracting her and promises to maintain an immoral relationship for a long time
 duusari ore abraham ek nai film selva ganesh ko sujhata he or uski ichha sooryakanth ko mukhya bhoomika main lene kii hoti he
 Suryakant tells Abraham to add spice and sex to the film so that the film can do good business
 isse abraham or gussa ho jaataa he or silk se nafrat karne lagata he
 On the other hand, Silk is convinced that films are for entertainment and continues to work
 vah sooryakanth ke saath kai uttejnapurna filmon main kaam karti he va apane nrity se purush varg main kaafii lokapriy ho jaati he or ek mashhoor or amir dakshinatya sex abhinetri ban jaati he
 Suryakant's younger brother and unnamed author Ramakant reveals that he is a fan of Silk and tries to befriend him
 silk is baat se khush hoti he ki aakhir koi use uske sharir ko nahin balki use pasand karata he
 They both go to Silk's old house where Silk's mother breaks up with him forever
 ek puraskaar samaaroh main silk ko uske kaary ke liye puraskrit kiya jaataa he parantu sooryakanth use dusron kaa 'darty sikret' kah kar badnaam kar detaa he
 Silk declares that she will continue making her 'dirty picture' and she has no shame in it
 silk ramakant ke saath zyada samaaya vyateet karne lagati he jo ab usase pyaar karne lagata he
 She asks him to emerge as a writer and advises him to get out of the shadows of his elder brother's film career
 unke is sambandh ko ek badhiya khabar maan kar ek patrkaar naila silk ko donon bhaaiyon ke saath sambandh rakhane ke liye badnaam karti he
 Suryakant ultimately removes Silk from his films, forcing him to work with smaller filmmakers
 apane is kaam se naakhush or bor hokar vah kaam karne kii ichha kho detii he jiske chalate duusare nirmaataa use or badnaam karne lagate he
 Later, at the launch party of Ramakant's new film, Silk meets a budding actress Shakeela
 usase jalan ke kaaran vah use apamaanit karti he or nrity karne ne liye uksaati he
 At the end of the dance, Silk deliberately drops Shakeela and shows that no one can beat her
 silk ke is bartaav se sharminda hokar ramakant usase rishta tod letaa he
 Silk's life begins to disintegrate
 sameekshak or mahilavarg use badnaam karne lagate he
 She becomes addicted to alcohol and smoking and starts gaining weight
 nirdeshak use apni filmon main lenaa band kar dete he
 She urges Selva to come to Ganesh to make a film that is badly beaten, causing her to lose both her wealth and fame
 iske saath-saath abraham bhi ek film relies karata he jisamen vah swayan mukhya bhoomika nibhaataa he or film safal ho jaati he
 Because of his success, Silk's failure and the conversation between the two, Abraham realizes that he has fallen in love with Silk
 khud ko uske bare main sochane se roak na paane ke kaaran vah silk ke ghar jaataa he jahaan donon silk kii jindagi ke bare main baat karte he
 By that time, Silk is under a huge debt and is forced to go to a small filmmaker to ask for work with whom he met at Ramakant's party
 vahaan jaakar use dhakka lagata he ki vah use ek ashleel film main lenaa chahta he or isse pehle kii vah virodh kare vah use sharaab ke nashe main dhutt karke chitrikaran shuru kar detaa he
 Soon the police raids the place but Silk manages to escape with everyone
 vah kisi tarah apane ghar pahunchati he jahaan use apni chhavi par shame aati he
 On the other hand, Abraham finds out Silk's mother and thinks of bringing them together the next morning
 par usee raat jab vah silk ko apni ek party se phone karata he to silk use apni taraf se sabko alavida kehane ko kahati he
 Abraham becomes suspicious and runs to Silk's house where he finds him dead in a silk scarlet with Indian make-up
 apni naakaamiyabi ke chalate silk neend kii goliyaan kha kar aatmahatya kar leti he
 Finally Abraham and his mother cremate him
 puri kahani abraham bhootkaal main suna rahaa hota he, jo akelaa aisa insaan tha jo silk kaa dard, uski khwahishen, uske sapane, uski mehnat or uske peeche kaa andheraa samaj sakaa tha jo uske udai or patan ke peeche chipa hua tha
 Ekta Kapoor decided to make this film after the success of Once Upon a Time in Mumbai with Luthria

 While researching for the film, Milan Luthria and Rajat Aroda found very few articles in magazines of that period because "women like Silk Smita could not find a place in magazines until they became a new topic of discussion"

 teen filmein triology ke teen sanskarnon ke bilkul anuroop to nahin he, lekin teenon hisse ke rupantaran kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai
 Jackson, however, adopted a more chronological approach to the story than Tolkien

 charitra-chithran ke vistaar ke liye nae drishyon ko bhi joda gaya
 During the filming, the screenplays continued to develop partly due to the contribution of the actors who wanted to make their characters more rusty

 Jackson assigned his old colleague Richard Taylor the leadership of five key design elements: armor, weapons, prosthetic / makeup, creatures, and miniatures at the Veta workshop
 In November 1997, renowned Tolkien lecturers Alan Lee and John Howe joined the project

 Taking advantage of the spirit of German nationalism, Bismarck invaded Denmark with the cooperation of Austria, and the two together merged the region into his kingdom
 do varsh baad bismark ne austria se bhi sangharsh ched diya
 Austria was defeated in the war and had to withdraw from Germany

 In order to reduce the threat of the "unfettered" power of the Pope, he enacted several laws for the power of the Catholics and tried to suppress the socialist movement
 isamen use adhik safalataa nahin mili
 Tensions and discontent arose in the empire
 antatagatva san 1890 main nae german samrat wiliam dwitiya se matbhed utpann ho jane ke kaaran usne padatyag kar diya
 Refuting the theory of liberals, Bismarck stated his policy in 1862 as follows: bismark kaa nishchit mat tha ki germany kaa ekikaran kabhi bhi france, rus, england evam austria ko sweekaar nahin hoga kyonki sanyukt germany europe ke shakti santulan ke liye sabase bada khatra hoga
 Therefore, Bismarck was convinced that the use of power was necessary for the unification of Germany
 bismark kaa mukhya uddeshy prasha ko shaktishaalee banaakar german sangh se austria ko baahar nikaalnaa evam germany main uske prabhaav ko samaapt karke prasha ke netritv main germany kaa ekikaran karnaa tha
 For this it was necessary that all power and authority of the state should be centered in the king
 bismark rajtantr main vishwaas rakhata tha
 Therefore, he tried to tie the entire nationality of Germany in one thread at the very center of the monarchy
 bismark ne apane sampoorn kaarykram ke dauraan is baat kaa vishesh dhyaan rakhaa ki germany ke ekikaran ke liye prasha kii asmita nasht na ho jaae
 He was not willing to sacrifice Prussa, as Piedmont did for the unification of Italy
 vah prasha main hi germany ko samahit kar lenaa chahta tha
 Bismarck did not want unification of Germany from the bottom up, that is, instead of awakening the spirit of integration in a liberal way, he wanted to unify from above, that is, through diplomacy and blood and iron policies he wanted the subordination of the German states Situation should not be done
 is drushti se vah prasha ke germanykaran nahin balki germany kaa prashaakaran karnaa chahta tha
 Bismarck became chancellor of Austria in 1832 and completed the unification of Germany through his diplomacy, prudent blood and iron policy
 1870 i
 main ekikaran ke baad bismark ne ghoshnaa kii ki germany ek santusht raashtra he or vah upniveshvaadi prasar main koi ruchi nahin rakhata
 In this way he attempted to allay fears about the expansion of Germany
 bismark ko germany kii aantarik samasyaon se guzarana padaa
 He presented solutions to these problems
 kintu samasyaon kii jatilta ne use 1890 main tyaagptr dene ko vivash kar diya
 After unification, industrialization took place rapidly in Germany
 kaarkaanon main mazdooron kii atishay vruddhi hui, kintu vahaan unki sthiti nimna rahi unke rahane-khaane kaa koi uchit prabandh nahin tha
 Due to deteriorating economic and social situation, the influence of socialists started increasing and considered them as their main enemy
 puure germany main kai tarah ke kanoon vyaapt the
 The wars during the integration led to a shortage of economic resources
 faltah desh kii aarthik pragati baadhit ho rahi thi
 Bismarck also faced a religious problem
 vastutah prasha ke log protestant dharm ke anuyaayi the jabaki germany ke anya rajyon kii praja adhikanshtah catholic dharm kii anuyaayi thi
 Catholics were strongly opposed to the unification of Bismarck because they feared that Protestant administration would suppress them
 austria or france ko parajeet kar bismark ne german catholic ko naaraaz kar diya tha, kyonki ye donon catholic desh the
 German Catholics were disillusioned when the Pope lost power from Rome and began to oppose Bismarck

 Their key leaders were jailed
 samachar-patron or sahitya par kathor pabandi laga di gai
 Along with these repressive measures, Bismarck began to use "state-socialism" to distance the workers from socialists
 iske tahat usne mazdooron ko yah dikhaaya ki rajya swayan mazdooron kii bhalaai ke liy prayatnsheel he
 He implemented several insurance schemes, pension schemes for the benefit of his laborers
 striyon or baalkon ke kaam karne ke ghanton ko nishchit kiya gaya
 This 'state socialism' of Bismarck was not genuine socialism, as it was opposed to democracy and was supportive of capitalism
 audyogic unnati ke liye bismark ne german udyogon ko sangrakshan diya jisase udyogo or utpaadan main vruddhi hui
 New mandis were needed to sell finished goods
 is aavashyaktaa ne bismark kii aupniveshik niti apnaane ke liye perrit kiya
 As a result, in 1884 AD, Bismarck established several trading posts in the eastern and southern-western parts of Africa and broke out of the union of the three emperors
 usne kaha ki bismark ne ek mitra kaa paksh lekar duusare mitra ko kho diya he
 Austria's friendship with Bismarck was more beneficial because Germany had more influence in the event of a treaty between Austria, so in 1879 a duel was signed
 5 rus kaa germany se vilag ho janaa bismark ke liye chintaa kaa vishay ban gaya
 He felt that Russia should not enter into a friendship treaty with France

 In 1881 he also got success

 5 Now Bismarck turned his attention to Italy and made a treaty with Italy and wanted to completely separate France from European politics
 isi samay france or italy donon hi africa main sthit tunis par adhikaar karne ko icchhuk the
 Bismarck encouraged France to seize Tunis so that goodwill would spread in favor of Germany in France and France would become embroiled in imperialism, thereby removing talk of revenge from Germany
 1881 main france ne tunis par adhikaar kar liya jisase italy naaraaz hua
 Taking advantage of Italy's displeasure, Bismarck in 1882 executed a threesome treaty between Italy, Germany and Austria
 bismark ne nai 'sandhi pranali' ko janm diya
 He made various groups by making an alliance
 is sandhi pranali kii visheshta yah thi ki saamanyatya itihaas main jitani bhi sandhiyaan hui hai ve yudhkaal main hui thi
 But Bismarck gave rise to a new approach by giving rise to the treaty system in peacetime
 teen samraaton kaa sangh : videshniti ke kshetra main sandhi pranali ke tahat bismark kaa pehla kadam tha
 In 1872, a union of three emperors was formed, including Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria, Tsar II of Russia and Emperor Willian i of Germany
 yadhyapi yah in teen deshon ke madhya koi likhit sandhi nahin thi, tathaapi kuch baton par sahmati hui thi
 They had agreed that in order to maintain peace in Europe and to deal with the socialist movement, they continued to cooperate and exchange ideas with each other
 yah sandhi bismark kii mahaan kootnithik vijay thi, kyonki ek taraf to usne cedova kii parajeet shakti austria ko mitra bana liya to duusari taraf france ke liye austria evam rus kii mitrataa kii sambhaavna ko samaapt kar diya
 But after some time this union broke up because the interests of Russia and Austria clashed in the Balkan region
 atah bismark ko rus or austria main se kisi ek ko chunanaa tha
 In the Treaty of Berlin of 1878, Bismarck had to choose between Russia and Austria, in which he favored Austria
 faltah rus usase naaraaz ho gaya
 To deal with religious issues and make the state paramount, Bismarck passed several laws against the Church
 1872 main jesuit samaaj kaa bahishkaar kar diya or prasha tathaa pope kaa sambandh-viched ho gaya
 According to the law passed in 1873, marriages started with the permission of the state courts, in which there was no need of the church
 shikshan sansthaaon par rajya kaa adhikaar ho gaya tathaa carch ko milane vaali sarkari sahaayta band kar di gai
 Despite these laws, Catholics did not bow down
 atah bismark ne samaajwaadiyon kii chunautiyon ko zyada khatarnaak samajhate hui catholicon ke saath samjhauta kiya
 Under this, laws against Catholics were repealed and established political relations with the Pope
 germany ke ekikaran ke pashchaat 1871 main bismark kii videsh niti kaa pramukh uddeshy europe main germany kii pradhanta ko banaae rakhana tha
 As a policy measure, it declared that Germany was a happy state and had no interest in territorial expansion
 bismark ko france se sarvaadhik bhay tha kyonki alses-lauren kaa kshetra usne france se praapt kiya tha, jisase france bahut asantusht tha
 Bismarck was confident that the French would not forget their 1870–71 defeat and the alsace-laurent region
 atah uski videsh niti kaa mukhya uddeshy france ko europe main mitraviheen rakhana tha taaki vah germany se yuddh karne kii sthiti main na aa sake
 In this way, the fundamental principles of Bismarck's foreign policy were - using practical opportunistic diplomacy to isolate the anti-german powers and make France devoid of allies, oppose liberalism and believe in militarism
 uski sandhi pranali ne pratisndhiyon ko janm diya
 As a result, a tense atmosphere was created in Europe and thus Europe reached the brink of World War I
 bismark kii videshniti ne europe main sanyeekaran evam shastreekaran ko badhaava diya
 This policy brought Europe to the threshold of the First World War
 bismark ne sabhi sandhiyaan paraspar virdohi rashtron ke saath kii thi
 Maintaining coordination between them was a very difficult task, which only a diplomat like Bismarck could do
 atah 1890 main pad tyaag karne ke pashchaat yah paddati ghaatak ho gai or germany ke viruddh france, rus aadi guton kaa nirmaan hua
 In this way, Bismarck's foreign policy in turn created the background of the First World War
 bismark kii gutbandi kii niti ke kaaran germany ke viruddh doosraa gut bana or ant main sampurna europe do sashastr evam shaktishaalee guton main vibhajit ho gaya
 The culmination of which appeared in the First World War
 1887 main bismark ne rus ke saath punaraashwaasan sandhi kii jiske tahat donon ne ek-duusare ko sahaayta dene kaa vachan diya
 This treaty was kept secret
 yah bismark kii kootnithik vijay thi kyonki ek hi saath germany ko rus or austria kii mitrataa praapt hui
 Bismarck tried to forge friendly relations with Britain
 bismark kaa maananaa tha ki britain ek nausainik shakti he or jab tak uski nausena ko chunauti nahin di jaaegi, tab tak vah kisi raashtra kaa virdohi nahin hoga
 Therefore, to please Britain, Bismarck did not take any step to increase the German Navy
 britain kii khush karne ke liye usne ghoshnaa kii ki germany samrajyavaadee desh nahin he
 England, on the other hand, had a colonial rivalry with France, taking advantage of which Bismarck developed good relations with Britain

 ALS association ke anusaar, sanyukt rajya america ke bujurg sainikon ko ALS hone kaa jokhim adhik he
 In their report called ALS in the Military, the group has indicated an almost 60% higher likelihood of the disease among older soldiers than the general public
 bujurg maamalon ke prashasan tathaa ek anya mahamari sangh DOD ke ek sanyukt adhyayan se yah baat saamne ai he ki khadi yuddh ke bujurgon ke liye, faras kii khadi main tainaat na hone vaale sainikon kii tulana main, isaki sambhaavna duguni he, jo vishakt jokhim se sambandh kii sambhaavna vyakt karata he
 a 2010 study has raised some questions on ALS prognosis in some elderly and athletes, suggesting that persistent brain trauma can lead to traumatic encephalopathy, similar to ALS; This may explain the high rate of ALS prognosis in those people
 saanchaa:medrs The defining feature of ALS is the end of both upper and lower motor upper motor neurons in the motor's cortex, cranial column, and spinal cord
 is vinaash se pehle, gatijanak neurons apane koshika nikaayon or akshatantuon main proteinous antarveshan kaa vikaas karte hai
 These inclusions often involve ubiquitin and typically contain any als-related protein: SOD1, TAR DNA binding protein, or FUS
 Interestingly, these inclusions are not colored with Congo Red or Theoflavin s pigments and are therefore non-amyloid aggregates
 yah un samucchy or patticoon se alag he jo protein samucchy ke kaaran upje anya tantrikupajanak rogon main dikhti he, jinamein alzimer rog, parkinson rog, hantington rog or preyon rog shaamil hai
 Genetic associations include: ALS ke kaaran gyaat nahin hai, haalanki kaaran ke nirdhaaran main ek mahatvapurn qadam uthaaya gaya jab 1993 main vaigyanikon ne yah pataa lagaaya ki Cu / Zn superoxide dismutes kinvak utpann karne vaale jin main utparivartan paariwarik ALS ke kuch maamalon se jude hue hai
 These enzymes are powerful anti-oxidants that protect the body from damage caused by superoxide, a toxic free radical, produced in mitochondria
 mukt mulankur atyadhik pratikriyasheel anu hai, jo mukhyatah mitocondria dwaara saamaanya chayapachay ke dauraan koshikaon dwaara utpaadit hote hai
 Free radicals can accumulate and damage the mitochondria and nuclear DNA and proteins, both inside the cells
 ab tak, SOD1 main 110 vibhinn prakaar ke utparivartan is rog se jode ja chuke hai, inamen se kuch kii bahut lambii naidanik avadhi hoti he, jabaki A4V jaise anya asaadhaaran rup se aakraamak hote hai
 Evidence suggests that failure of immunity to oxidative stress controls the programmed cell end, among many other possible consequences
 haalanki yah abhi tak spasht nahin he ki kaise SOD1 jin utparivartan, gatijanak neuron vikruti kii ore le jaataa he, shodhakartaaon ne anumaan lagaaya he ki is jin kii doshapurn kriya ke kaaran mukt mulankur kaa sangrahan ho saktaa he
 Current research, however, suggests that the end of the motile neuron is not likely a result of cessation or risk of reversal action, suggesting that mutant SOD1 induces toxicity in another way
 utparivarti SOD1 paariwarik peshishoshi parshv kaathinya main SOD1 kii bhoomika ko lekar transgenic chuhon par kiye gaye adhyayanon se kai siddhant nikle hai
 Mice lacking the SOD1 gene have not been traditionally affected by ALS, although they exhibit age-related muscular atrophy and acceleration of luminary lifespan
 yah suchit karata he ki utparivarti SOD1 ke vishakt gun, saamaanya kriya kii kshati naa hokar kriya kii pragati kaa parinaam he
 In addition, aggregation of proteins has also been found to be a common clinical symptom of both familial and sporadic ALS
 Interestingly, in mutant SOD1 mice, aggregates of mutant SOD1 were found only in diseased tissues and were found to be high during motile neuron degeneration
 yah anumaan lagaaya gaya ki utparivarti SOD1 kaa samucchy sangrahan mitocondria, proteisoms, protein folding sangrakshikaaon, yaa anya proteinon ko kshati pahunchaa kar koshikeey kriyaaon main khalal daalane main bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Any such disruption, if proven, would lead to significant reliability in the theory that aggregates are involved in the toxicity of mutant SOD1
 aalochakon ne paaya he ki maanav main, SOD1 utparivartan sampurna maamalon maamalon main se keval 2% ke lagbhag ke liye hi jimmedaar he or nidaanshastreey tantra unase alag ho saktaa he jo beemaari ke chhitput prakaaron ke liye jimmedaar hai
 To date, ALS-SOD1 mice have been the best samples for preclinical studies of the disease, but it is expected that more useful models will be developed
 adhyayanon main motor neuron vikruti main glutamet kii bhoomika par jor diya gaya he
 Glutamate is one of the brain's chemical messengers or neurotransmitters
 vaigyanikon ne paaya he ki swasth logon kii tulana main, ALS rogiyon ke serum or merudandi taral glutamet kaa ucch str hota he
 Riluzole is currently the only FDA approved drug for ALS and targets glutamate vectors
 iskaa uttarjivita par maamuli sa prabhaav he, tathaapi yah is baat ko sujhata he ki glutamet kaa aadhiky hi beemaari kaa ekmaatr kaaran nahin he
 No tests provide a definitive diagnosis of ALS, although the presence of an upper and lower motile neuron in the same limb may be a strong indication
 iske bajaay, ALS kaa nidaan mukhya rup se chikitsak dwaara rogi main dekhe gaye lakshan or chihnon par aadhaarit he or anya rogon kii ashanka ko dur karne ke liye kai pareekshan kiye jate hai
 Physicians obtain a complete medical history of the patient and usually perform neurological tests at regular intervals to assess the progressive loss of symptoms such as muscle weakness, muscle contraction, overversion and stiffness
 kyonki ALS ke lakshan vistrut vividhta liye anya anek upachaarya rogon yaa vikaron se milte-julate hai, atah un rogon kii sambhaavnaaon ko shaamil na karne ke liye upyukt pareekshan karnaa zaruri he
 One of these tests is electromyography, a specialized recording technique that detects electrical activity in muscles
 kuch EMG nishkarsh ALS ke nidaan kaa samarthan kar sakate hai
 Another common test measures nerve conduction velocity
 NCV kii vishisht asaamanyataon ke parinaam udhaaharan ke liye suzav de sakate hai ki mariz ALS ke bajaay paridhiy neuropathy ke ek rup se yaa myopathy se grast he
 The doctor may ask for magnetic resonance imaging, which is an non-proliferative procedure, using magnetic fields and radio waves to take detailed images of the brain and spinal cord
 haalanki ye MRI scan ALS se peedit rogiyon main aksar saamaanya hi rahete hai, ve un anya lakshanon ko prakat kar sakate hai jo ye lakshan paidaa kar rahe hon, jaise ki ridh kii haddi kaa tumor, bahu-kaathinya, gardan main sansrit discs, nalvranshoth yaa gravaksherukashoth 
 Depending on the patient's symptoms and the findings of the tests, and with these tests, the physician may order blood and urine tests, along with routine laboratory tests, to rule out the possibility of other diseases
 kuch maamalon main, udhaaharan ke liye, agar ek chikitsak ko andeh he ki mariz ALS ke bajaay myopathy se peedit he, to mansapeshi biopsy karaayaa ja saktaa he
 Infectious diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus, human T-cell leukemia virus, Lyme disease, syphilis and tick-borne encephalitis virus can cause als-like symptoms in some cases
 bahu kaathinya, post-polio syndrome, multifocal motor neuropathy, CIDP or ridh kii haddi main peshi shosh jaise tantrika sambandhi vikaar rog ke kuch pahaluon kii nakal utaar sakate hai or roganidan kaa prayaas karne vaale chikitsakon ko in par vichaar karnaa chahie
 Because of the prognosis and the many diseases or disorders associated with ALS in the initial state of the disease by this diagnosis, patients should always seek another neurological consultation
 khaadya or aushadh prashasan ne rog ke ilaaj ke liye sirf ek hi dawa riluzol ko manzari di he
 Riluzole is believed to reduce damage to the motor neuron by reducing glutamate release by activation of glutamate vectors
 iske alaava, dawa sodium va calcium ke channelon ke avrodh, protein kynez c kaa nishedh, or NMDA receptor antgonism main vruddhi dwaara anya snayusanrakshi prabhaavon ko prastut karata he
 Clinical trials conducted on ALS patients showed that riluzole prolongs survival several months and that those with bulbar onset may benefit from even more survival
 dawa rogi ko ventilation samarthan kii jarurat se pehle hi avadhi badha detii he
 Riluzole cannot reverse the damage to motor neurons that have already occurred, and patients taking the drug should be monitored for liver damage and other possible side effects
 Although only a minor first step, Riluzole offers hope that the progression of ALS may one day be slowed by a new drug or combination of drugs
 ALS ke anya upachaar, lakshanon se mukt hone or rogiyon ke jivan kii gunvattta main sudhaar ke liye pariklpit hai

 Researchers have stated that "energy intake in ALS patients is extremely low and therefore recommended to increase energy intake
 " donon, pashu or maanviya anusandhanon kaa suzav he ki ALS rogiyon ko jahaan tak sambhav ho adhik calories lene ke liye protsaahit kiya janaa chahie or unke calories antargrahan ko pratibandhit nahin karnaa chahie
 Many ALS patients use complementary and alternative medicines in an attempt to slow the pace of their disease
 inamen lokapriy vitamin anupoorak, jaise ki vitamin si, vitamin or poshak tatwon kii ucch khuraaq, paaramparik chini chikitsa, yaa acupankchar, reki, yaa maalish jaise chikitsa ke anya rup shaamil ho sakate hai
 Till date, there is no such practice which shows that the reach of this type of treatment has any effect on the progression of the disease

 History is particularly used in two ways
 ek he pracheen athwa vigat kaal kii ghatnaayen or doosraa un ghatnaon ke vishay main dharna
 The word history implies "it was sure"
 greece ke log itihaas ke liye "histari" shabd kaa prayog karte the
 "histari" literally meant "weave"
 anumaan hota he ki gyaat ghatnaon ko vyavasthit dhang se bunakar aisa chitra upasthit karne kii koshish kii jaati thi jo sarthak or susambaddha ho
 Thus the word history means anecdote group, veeragatha or historical evidence derived from tradition
 itihaas ke antargat ham jis vishay kaa adhyayan karte hai usamen ab tak ghatit ghatnaon yaa usase sambandh rakhanevaali ghatnaon kaa kalkrmanusaar varnan hota he
 In other words, history is the name of specific human events
 yaa phir pracheenta se naveenta kii ore aane vaali, maanavjaati se sambandhit ghatnaon kaa varnan itihaas he
 These events and historical evidence are proved on the basis of fact
 itihaas ke mukhya aadhaar yugavishesh or ghatnasthal ke ve avshesh hai jo kisi na kisi rup main praapt hote hai
 Due to the multifaceted pervasiveness of life, it is inauspicious to paint the past era or society with the help of self-material
 saamagree jitani hi adhik hoti jaati he usee anupaat se beete yug tathaa samaaj kii ruparekha prastut karnaa saadhy hota jaataa he
 Notwithstanding adequate means, it cannot be said that the imaginary picture will certainly be pure or true
 isliye upyukt kami kaa dhyaan rakhkar kuch vidvan kehete hai ki itihaas kii sampoornataa asaadhya si he, phir bhi yadi hamaara anubhav or gyaan prachur ho, aitihaasik saamagree kii jaanch-padtaal ko hamaari kala tarkpratishthat ho tathaa kalpana sanyat or viksit ho to ateet kaa hamaara chitra adhik maanviya or pramanik ho saktaa he
 The summary is that in the creation of history, there is a need for adequate material, scientific investigation, the discretion to understand the importance of the knowledge gained from it, as well as the power of historical imagination and the ability to depict life
 samaran rakhana chahie ki itihaas na to saadhaaran paribhaasha ke anusaar vigyaan he or na keval kaalpanik darshan athwa saahitiyik rachana he

 Its primary map conjectures that a satisfactory history of the world requires a very long time, effort, and organization

 where Where The diffusion process is controlled by this equation
 yah fik kaa doosraa niyam he
 If there is no electrically charged particle in the solution, then d is related to the mobility of the particles b and then d = k TB where k is the boltsmon's constant, t is the ultimate temperature and b is the mobility of the particles
 yadi kan r trigya ke gola he or vilaayak ke anu se bade hai, to b stoke ke niyam se praapt hota he
