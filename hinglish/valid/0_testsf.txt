21 Modern trends prevailing The history of library classification shows that the schemes of classification have evolved from full numerical, such as the Library of Congress and Rider International classification, to independent, analytic-syntactic, such as - the third version of duality classification
 
 vargeekaran kii aadhuniktam prachlit pravritiyaan: maanakeekaran, siddhanton par aadhaarit atithy yojana or sanganakeekaran hai
 During the last few years, efforts are being made towards uniformity of classification ie 'international Classification Scheme'
 yah buddhijivi pathakon, visheshkar vidwaanon kii ant:shakti kii aavashyak bachat pradaan karegaa
 It has been felt that such a method should be developed which is based on principles
 gyaan vistaar bahut hi teevrgati se ho rahaa he
 New inter-control and external issues are arising
 is vistaar se prabhaavapurvak tathaa utpaadak rup se nipatane ke liye ek vargeekaran yojana aisi honi chahie jo apni mul sanrachana ko bina badale, naye vichaaron ko ek saraahneey str tak, suvidhapurvak samyojit kar sake
 The need for progressive principles of classification has been felt for guiding the development of classification scheme, method for preparing its structure and classification of documents
 yah kaary ranganathan dwaara pradutt vargeekaran ke siddhanton par aadhaarit aatithy janaa dwaara sambhav ho sakaa or vargeekaran yojana ko aadhuniktam banane main sahaayak siddh hua
 In today's era, there is a trend of computerization for the maintenance and retrieval of information
 hamen soochna ke pun: prapan tathaa uske sanghathan hetu shaktishaalee takneekon tathaa upkarnon kii aavashyaktaa he
 In computerized information retrieval of information systems, the need for classification has been felt, the importance of its classification increases
 ek duusari pravriti-saamaanya banaam vishesh vargeekaran kii he
 Because it is expected from all kinds of libraries, information centers, documentation centers that it will have a collection of all types of documents, but special importance has given them a very micro-level classification of the documents to which they belong
 Is necessary
 is prakaar sabhi prakaar ke pralekhon kaa vargeekaran hetu saamaanya banaal vargeekaran kaa hona paramaavashyak he
 It was Dr
 Ranganath who created a new type of taxonomy - the 'self-oriented, analytical-syntactic taxonomy', which was freely accepted not only for panel arrangement but also for preparing indexes, etc
 
 vargeekaran ke liye `swatantra-mukh, vishleshnatmak, sanshleshneey yojana' anya yojanaayen jaise--praaia: gananaatmak udhaahrant: dui dashamalav vargeekaran, praaia: falkit udhaahrant: sarvavyaapak dashamalvawargeekaran or drudh falkit
 For example, the first and second versions of bipartite classification provide much more modernity
 jo vargeekaran ke aadhuniktam prachlan tathaa samasyaon, ke hal karne kaa maatr upaay he
 Dr
 Ranganathan's highest contribution in the field of classification is the bipartite classification, which was first published in 1933
 dwitiya sanskaran 1939 main, tritiy 1950 main, chaturth 1952 tathaa pancham 1957 va shashtham 1960 main prakashit hue or saptam sanskaran abhi bhi anischitata ke mode par he
 Dr
 Ranganathan is known not only as a taxonomist, but also as a classographer
 san 1946-47 ke dauraan jab ve kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay ke granthalay vigyaan ke professor tathaa pustakalayadhyaksh the, unhone apni vargeekaran yojana ke anusaar vishvavidhyalay granthalay ke lagbhag ek lakh granthon kaa phir se vargeekaran lagbhag 18 mahinon ke alp samay main kiya
 For this work, he took the help of his own given rule of osmosis
 mahatvapurn baat yah rahi ki yah sab kuch unhone apane uttardaayitvapurn kaaryon jaise-pathan kaary, prashasnic kaaryon aadi kaa paalan karte huye apni 56 varsh kii avasthaa main kiya
 Dr
 Ranganathan introduced the first 'classification principle'
 yah siddhanth vargeekaran tantron kaa dhaanchaa taiyaar karne tathaa anya shabd-bhandar niyantrak upayon ke liye taratamyata, ekarupata or thospan pradaan karte hai
 In modern trends its use is as follows: `vargeekaran kaary ko teen falkon main vibhajit hona chahie', aisa anubhav kiya ja chukaa he
 This idea was first accepted by Dr
 Ranganathan in 1944
 san 1952 tak, ve is lakshya ko acchhee tarah samajhane main sakasham rahe tathaa vargeekaran kaary ko teen falkon arthath kalpana falak, maukhik falak or an kann falak main vibhajit kiya
 They found that the 'thought board' is probably related to analyzing and synthesizing joint and mixed subjects into their faces, sub-faces, and surprises, and providing auxiliary sequences
 `vaachik falak' main kaary paribhaashit shabdaawalee ke liye upasutron se kendrit hota he tathaa maanak paribhaashik-shabdaawalee se shabdon ke naveenatam prachlit swaroop ko vyakt karata he
 It will be very helpful if the international terminology-terminology is established and adopted for use
 `a nann falak' main saamaanya vichaaron ko adko dwaara prastut kiya jaataa he
 Dr
 Ranganathan used the framework of the mixed non-system to provide more hospitality
 unhone naveen vichaaron ko atyadhik aatithy pradaan karne ke liye tathaa a can kii dridhtaa ko todane hetu anek yuktiyon ko sammilit kiya
 These 'block devices', 'vacancy devices', 'empty marks', 'nilakaran-ak', and 'zero-zero factor ak', used to extrapolate and inject new ideas
 in sabake baavjood unhone or bhi yuktiyaan bahutayat rup se aatithy praapt karne ke liye di, ve hai: punjit yukti, varnmalee yukti, kalkram yukti, utkrisht yukti, saamaanya upmukh yukti, dashamalav ansh yukti, gananaatmak yukti, vaataavaran yukti, mukhit yukti, bhugolic yukti, samooh a can yukti, mishrit aadhaar yukti, sankhyatmak yukti, aslesh yukti, smriti-sahaayak talika yukti vishay yukt, ityadi
 He used variable power-provided coordinate symbols for the nuns, which later became known as indicator numbers
 yah sanganak ke prayog ko bhi aasaan banaate hai
 Indicators act like bolts and nuts in forming a variety of joint and compound subjects by connecting points, sub-faces taken from different tables
 dow ranganathan ne vargeekaran aacharyon tathaa vargeekaron ko ek disha pradaan karne ke liye abhidhaaranon, upasutron tathaa siddhanton kaa ek sangathit samooh samaveshit kiya
 These theories, thesis and sub-sources, documentation research and training centers have been tested in the Granthalaya and Department of Library Sciences of various universities of India during the actual library classification
 dow ranganathan ke `prolagomena tu librari classification' ke tisare sanskaran main, 11 maanakeey siddhanth, 40 upasutra, 13 abhidharanayen,4 siddhanth mukh-anukram ke liye tathaa 18 siddhanth sahaayak-anukram ke liye diye gayi hai
 He gave the idea of mulmukh, Submukh, and Specifiers
 ye upmukh, paanch moulik shreniyon: vyaktitv, tatv, urja, sthaan, tathaa samay main vibhakt hai
 Collectively these are pmes
 Is known as T
 ye ek yaa ek-duusare--or maatr ek kii abhivyakti hai, aisa abhidhaarit kiya gaya he
 Principles of his mouth-sequence: diwal-chitra theory, entire organ theory, cow-calf theory, karyavastu-kriya-kriyak Siddhanta, are not only helpful in preparing the structure of classification system but also in other vocabulary control devices
 dow ranganathan ne saiddhanthik vikaas par aadhaarit, bahut se vishyon ke liye vargeekaran tantra kaa dhaanchaa taiyaar kiya tha
 There are about 150 such subjects, for which intensive tables have been prepared on the basis of bipartite classification
 `enles pha librari scince tathaa `documentation and librari scince' main vargeekaran par prakashit unke lekh, gahan vargeekaran se sambandhit kathin samasyaon ko hal karne main paryaapt rup se sahaayak he
 In our view, Dr
 Ranganathan will be remembered in future not for two-point classification, but for its fundamental principles
 soochikaran granthalay vigyaan kii vah shakha he, jo anek krantikari parivartanon tathaa vikaason kaa haal hi kaa sakshi he
 The similarities of the latest cataloging trends of the work done by Dr
 Ranganathan for cataloging can be understood as follows

 The Chinese language is the Surabhedi language spoken by most of the people of the world
 bharat main punjabi or dogri jaisi pashchimi pahari bhashaayen surabhedi hoti hai
 To some extent, emotions are communicated through notes in every language, but the meaning of words with the same characters varies only with the letters in the Surabhedi languages
 angreji main surabhedi bhashaaon ko "tonal langvejiz" kehete hai
 The meaning of the word "ma" in Chinese depends on the change of tone - agar suron ke badlaav ko tiron se dikhaaya jaae, to chini kii ek pankti is prakaar ho sakati he - If someone is not used to the Surabhedi languages, then he will only feel "mama ma ma de ma ma" in this line
 use lagegaa ke ek hi "maa" shabd baar-baar doharaaya ja rahaa he jabaki alag-alag suron kii vajah se vastav main yahan paanch alag shabd kahe ja rahe hai

 a market segment is a subdivision of a market, made up of people or organizations that share one or more characteristics, which demand a similar product and / or services based on the attributes of those products, such as price or function
 Causes ek sachcha bazaar kshetra nimnaankit sabhi mandandon ko puraa karata he: yah anya kshetron se alag he, yah khand ke bheetar sajaateey he ; yah bazaar protsaahan ke prati ekasmaan pratikriya karata he or bazaar hastkshep ke zarie is tak pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 The term is also used when consumers with similar products and / or services are divided into groups so that different amounts are obtained from them
 Broadly, these can be seen as 'positive' and 'negative' applications of the same idea, where the market is divided into small groups
 haalanki saidhantik rup se 'adarsh' bazaar kshetra maujuud ho sakate hai, par vastav main bazaar main karyrat prayek sanghathan, bazaar kshetron kii kalpana vibhinn tareeqon se viksit kar sakate hai or in kshetron kaa faaydaa uthaane ke liye utpaada vishishtikaran ranneeti taiyaar kar sakate hai
 Market segmentation and a corresponding product differentiation strategy can give firms a temporary commercial advantage
 bazaar vibhaajan, bazaar ko ek jaisi zarurat yaa aavashyaktaaon vaale vyaktigat bazaaron ke samoohon main vibhajit karnaa he, jise company bazaar ko alag samoohon main baantati hai, jinaki alag aavashyaktaaen, zaruuratein, vyavhaar hai yaa jo alag utpaada or sevaayen chaahate hai
 Broadly, the market can be divided according to common criteria, such as by industry or on a public versus private basis, although the industrial market segmentation is quite different from the consumer market segmentation, but the objectives are the same
 vibhaajan ke ye sab tareeqe asli vibhaajan ke liye pratinidhi maatr hai, jo hameshaa suvidhajanak janasankhyikeey simaaon ke anukool nahin hote
 Consumer-based market segmentation can be done on a product-specific basis, so as to create closer synergies between specific products and individuals
 However, numerous general market area systems also exist, such as the Nielsen Claritas PRIZM system, based on statistical analysis of household and geographic data, providing a broad segmentation of the United States population
 vibhaajan kii prakriya lakshyikaran or sthiti se alag he
 The overall objective is to identify similar customers and groups of potential customers; So as to set priority for targeting groups; Understand their behavior; And react with the appropriate marketing strategy, so that the selected ones can satisfy the different preferences of each region
 Thus revenue improvement is possible
 unnat vibhaajan se vipanan prabhavakaarita main kaafii sudhaar ho saktaa he
 Different regions may have different industry structures and thus may have more or less attraction
 With the right segmentation, the right list can be purchased, better advertising results can be found, and customer satisfaction can be increased, leading to better reputation

 This usually requires the use of customer relationship management software or some kind of database

 Various demographic, behavioral, and psycho-graphical samples are produced using techniques such as mass analysis
 is prakriya ko kabhi-kabhi database vipanan yaa vyashti-vipanan kaha jaataa he

 Mass adaptation is possible through this process

 Partitioning is commonly used by organizations in retention programs for their customers and to ensure that they: pratidhaaran-aadhaarit vibhaajan ke prati mul drushtikon he ki company apane sakriy graahakon ko 3 mulyon se jodatii he: Tag # 1: Is there a high risk of this customer canceling the company's service? One of the most common signs of high risk customers is a decrease in the use of the company's service
 For example, in the credit card industry this may be indicated by a reduction in spending by the customer through his card
 tag # 2: kya yah graahak banaae rakhane laayaq he? is nishchay kaa nichod yah nikalataa he ki kya graahak se pratidhaaran-pasch janit laabh, is graahak ko banaae rakhane kii laagat se adhik hone kii sambhaavna he
 Tag # 3: Which retention strategy should be used to retain this customer? In the case of customers who are considered "maintainable", it is necessary for the company to find out which saving strategy is likely to be more successful
 saamanytah ranneetiyon main "vishesh" graahak chhot se lekar, graahakon ko uplabdh karai jane vaali seva ke mulya prastaav ko sudrudh karne vaali soochnaaon kaa preshan shaamil hai
 The basic approach to tag customers is to use historical data for predictions about the following active customers: yahaan lakshya aitihaasik pratidhaaran data se samaan gun vaale graahakon ke saath sakriy graahakon kaa milan karnaa he
 Using the theory that "all birds with similar feathers fly in the same flock", the basis of access is the assumption that active customers can get the same results from their equivalent predecessors

 Price differentials would need to impose a rate fence, which would prevent members of the higher denomination from purchasing the price available to members of the lower denomination
 For monopolies this behavior is rational, but is often seen by contesting authorities as an abuse of monopoly status, regardless of whether the monopoly is approved or not

 Jehovah is the name of God in Judaism and in Hebrew
 yahudee maanate hai ki sabase pehle ye naam parameshwar ne hazarat musa ko sunaaya tha
 This word appears several times in the Bible's Old Testament Scriptures of Christians and Jews
 note karen ki yahudiyon kii dharmabhasha ibrani kii lipi ibrani lipi main kaval vyanjan likhe ja sakate hai or hrasv swar to bilkul hi nahin
 So the word is made up of four consonants: י ה ו ה, or יהוה, ie yah-ha-wah
 isamen log vibhinn swar ghusaakar ise vibhina uccharan dete hai, jaise yahova, yahaveh, yahaveh, jehova, aadi 
 The Jews considered it useless to take the name of God as a sin, so this word was rarely spoken
 zyaada mashhoor shabd tha "adonai" 
 In the Old Testament / Hebrew Scriptures, the words "L" and "elohim" are also used for God, but strangely, the Jews say that they believe in one God, but the word "elohim" is euphemistic
 Allah is Allah

 Jews and Christians believe that Jehovah's literal meaning is: "I am who i am" - that is, the self-proclaimed God

 Meiosis in biology) is a process of negative division in which the number of chromosomes present in each cell is halved
 pashuon main ardhasutrivibhaajan hameshaa yugmakon ke nirmaan main parinit hota he, jabaki anya jeevon main isse bijaanu utpann ho sakate hai
 Like mitosis, before meiosis begins, the DNA of the primordial cell repeats in the S-phase of the cell cycle
 do koshika vibhaajanon dwaara ye dohare chromosome chaar agunit yugmakon yaa bijaanuon main bant jate hai
 Meiosis is essential for sexual reproduction and therefore occurs in all eukaryotes
 kuch ucaryociton main, visheshkar bideloid rotifaron main ardhasutrivibhaajan kii kshamta nahin hoti or ve anishekajanan dwaara prajnan karte hai
 Archaea or bacteria do not have meiosis and they reproduce through sexual processes such as binary fission
 ardhasutrivibhaajan ke samay dwiguneet janan koshika kaa jinom, jo chromosomon main bhare hue diene ke lambey hisson se bana hota he, kaa diene doharaapan or uske baad vibhaajan ke do daur hote hai, jisase chaar agunit koshikaayen utpann hoti hai
 Each of these cells contains an entire set of chromosomes of the original cell or half of its gene-content
 yadi ardhasutrivibhaajan se yugmak utpann hue, to ye koshikaayen ko garbhaadhan ke samay sanyojit hokar anya kisi bhi tarah ke vikaas ke pehle nai dwiguneet koshika yaa yagmaj kaa nirmaan karti hai
 Thus the division process of meiosis is an interaction between two genomes at the time of conception
 chunki har matapita ke chromosomon kaa ardhasutrivibhaajan ke samay samadharmi punahsanyog hota he, isaliye prayek yugmak or har yugmaj ke diene main ek anuthi sankethik ruparekha nihit hoti he
 Meiosis and conception both lead to sexuality in eukaryotes and to individuals with distinct genotypes in populations
 sabhi paudhon or kai protiston main ardhasutrivibhaajan ke parinamswaroop bijaanu naamak agunit koshikaon kaa nirmaan hota he jo bina garbhaadhan ke alangik tareeke se vibhajit ho sakati hai
 The gametes in these groups are produced by mitosis
 ardhasutrivibhaajan main chromosomon ke punahvitaran ke liye sutrivibhaajan main prayukt jaevrasynic paddatiyon main se hi kai paddatiyon kaa prayog hota he
 Meiosis has several unique features, the most important being the pairing and recombination of homologous chromosomes
 miyosis shabd kaa mul miyo he, jiskaa matlab he-kam yaa alp
 Meiosis was discovered in 1876 by the noted German biologist Oscar Hertwig in the eggs of sea urchin and described it for the first time
 belgian jeevvaigyanik edward vaan benneden ne phir se iskaa vivaran chromosomon ke str par 1883 main escaris ke andon main diya
 The importance of meiosis in reproduction and heredity was first reported in 1890 by German biologist August Weismann, who stated that if cell numbers were to be maintained, two cell divisions were needed to convert a diploid cell into four haploid cells
 it occurs
 1911 main american jinshastri thomas hunt morgan ne drosophilia melenogoster ke ardhasutrivibhaajan main crossover hote dekha or pehla jeneey saboot diya ki chromosomon par jeenon kaa sancharan hota he
 Meiosis is thought to have originated 1
4 billion years ago
 eucaryociton ke keval ekscavetta naamak supergrup ke sabhi jeevon main ardhasutrivibhaajan nahin hota
 Meiosis genes are universally present in all of the other five main supergroups, Apisthoconta, Amebazoa, Rhizaria, Archeoplastida, and Chromalviolates, even if they are not always active
 Some Excavata species also have meiosis which supports the supposition that it is an ancient, paraphyletic group of clades
 aise eukarotic jeev, jisamen ardhasutrivibhaajan nahin hota, kaa ek udhaaharan euglinide he
 Meiosis occurs during sexual reproduction of eukaryotic life cycles, with frequent cyclic processes of meiosis and conception
 yah saamaanya sutrikoshika vibhaajan ke saath-saath jari rahata he
 In multicellular organisms there is an intermediate notch between the transition period from diploid to haploid where the organism develops
 jeev tab janan koshikaon kii utpatti karata he jo jivan-chakra main jari rahati hai
 The remaining cells, called somatic cells, function within the organism and die with it
 ardhasutrivibhaajan or garbhaadhan ke chakra ke kaaran agunit or dwiguneet dashaaen baari-baari se doharaai jaati hai
 The biological state of the life cycle can be in diploid state, haploid state, or both
 is tarah, jaivik avasthaaon ke sthaan ke anusaar, langik prajnan kaa prayog karne vaale teen prakaar ke jivan-chakra hote hai
 In the gametes life cycle, which also occurs in humans, the species is diploid and develops from a diploid cell called the zygote
 jeev kii dwiguneet janan-rekha stem koshikaayen ardhasutrivibhaajan dwaara agunit yugmakon kaa nirmaan karti hai jo sanyukt hokar yugmaj kaa nirmaan karte hai
 The diploid zygote undergoes cell division several times through mitosis to develop the organism
 sutrivibhaajan ardhasutrivibhaajan se sambandhit prakriya he jo paitruk koshika ke jinaatmak sadrush do koshikaon kaa nirmaan karti he
 The general principle is that somatic cells produce somatic cells and meiosis produce germ cells
 yugmaj jivan-chakra main jati agunit hoti he, jo yugmak naamak ek ekal agunit koshika ke prafalan or vibhedikaran se utpann hoti he
 Two organisms of different sexes form their diploid zygotes by providing their haploid germ cells
 is yugmaj kaa turant ardhasutrivibhaajan ho jaataa he, jisase chaar agunit koshikaon kii utpatti hoti he
 These cells form the organism through mitosis
 kai kavak or protojoa yugmaj jivan-chakra ke sadsy hai
 In the spore life cycle, the organism has alternating haploid and diploid conditions
 isaliye is chakra ko pidiyon kaa adal-badal bhi kaha jaataa he
 Spores are produced by meiosis of the diploid germ line cells
 ye bijaanu sutrivibhaajan dwaara prafalit hokar ek agunit jeev main viksit hote hai
 Then the germ cells of a haploid organism combine with other haploid organisms to form a zygote
 is yugmaj kaa baar-baar sutrivibhaajan or prafalan hokar punah dwiguneet jeev kaa vikaas hota he
 Spore life cycles can be called a combination of gametes and zygotic life cycles
 chunki ardhasutrivibhaajan ek ‘ek-tarafa’ prakriya he, isaliye sutrivibhaajan kii tarah koshika-chakra main juta hua nahin mana ja saktaa he
 But the type and name of the steps of its preparation before meiosis are similar to the interfaces of the mitosis cell cycle
 interfez kii teen avasthaaen hoti hai- Interphase is followed by meiosis i and then meiosis II
 ardhasutrivibhaajan i main do sahodara chromatidon se bane samarupi chromosomon kii jodiyaan alag hokar do koshikaon main badal jaati hai
 Each female cell contains an entire haploid volume of chromosomes; The first meiosis reduces the quality of the original cell by a factor of 2
 ardhasutrivibhaajan II main prayek chromosome ke sahodara dhaagon kaa pruthakkikaran hota he or vyaktigat chromated agunit kanya koshikaon main bant jate hai
 Two cells arising from meiosis i divide during meiosis II, forming 4 haploid female cells
 ardhasutrivibhaajan i or II dono, profez, metafez, anophez or tilophez main bante hote hai, jinka uddheshy sutrivibhaajan koshika chakra ke samarupi usivasthaaon ke samaan hi hota he
 Therefore, meiosis includes the stages of meiosis i and meiosis II
 ardhasutrivibhaajan jeneey vividhta ko do tarah se utpann karata he swatantra sanrekhan or tatpashchaat pehle ardhasutrivibhaajan ke samay samarupi chromosomon kii jodiyon kaa pruthakkikaran, jisase prayek chromosome segregeton kaa prayek yugmak main aniyat or swatantra chunaav hota he or profez i main samarupi punahsanyog dwaara samarupi chromosomiy kshetron kaa bhautik vinimay hokar chromosomon ke bheetar diene ke nae sangyojan banate hai
 Meiosis i separates homologous chromosomes to form two haploid cells, so it is called negative division
 niyamit dwiguneet maanav koshika main 46 chromosome hote hai or use 2N mana jaataa he kyonki usamen samarupi chromosomon kii 23 jodiyaan hoti hai
 But after meiosis I, although the cell contains 46 chromatids, it is considered 23 chromosome N
 aisa isaliye hota he kyonki aage chalakar anophez i main, jis samay tarku sahodara chromatidon ko nai koshika ke dhruvon kii taraf khinchataa he, tab yah jodi saath main bani rahati he
 Meiosis II has equidistant division similar to that of mitosis, whereby the sibling chromatids eventually divide and a total of 4 haploid cells per daughter cell produced from the first division
 profez i main samarupi punahsanyog naamak prakriya se samarupi chromosomon ke bich diene kaa aadan-pradaan hota he
 This often leads to chromosomal crossover
 crassovar ke samay bane diene ke nae sangyojan jeneey parivartanon ke mahatvapurn strot hote he or eleelon ke nae laabhadaayak sanyojanon kii utpatti kar sakate hai
 Couple and double chromosomes are called bivalents or tetrads, which contain two chromosomes and four chromatids, with one chromosome derived from each parent
 is avasthaa main, kiyazma naamak vinduon par asahaadaraa chromatidon kaa crassovar ho saktaa he
 The first stage of prophase i is the leptotene stage, also known as leptonema
 is avasthaa main, akele chromosome kendrak ke bheetar lambey bhaagon main sanghanit hone lagata hai
 But both sibling chromatids are still so tightly bound that they cannot be distinguished from each other
 zaigotin dasha main, jise zaigonima bhi kaha jaataa he, chromosome samarupi chromosome jodiyon ke choop main paas-paas qatari main jamaa ho jate hai
 This is called the bouquet stage, because the telomeres converge at one end of its corresponding nucleus
 is dasha main, samarupi chromosomon kaa yugaleekaran hota he
 In the pachytene condition, also known as pachinima, the following chromosomal crossovers occur
 samarupi chromosomon ke asahodara chromated betaratib tareeke se samroop kshetron par jeneey jaankaree ke bhaagon kaa vinimay karte hai
 But sexual chromosomes are not completely uniform and only exchange information over a small region of homology
 vinimay un sthanon par hota he jahaan par punahsangyojan ganthen banati hai
 The exchange of information between non-homologous chromatids leads to recombination of information; Each chromosome has the same complete set of information that it had before and there are no errors due to this process
 Since chromosomes cannot be detected in the synaptonimal complex, the cross-over cannot actually be seen with a microscope
 diplotine dasha main, jise diplonima bhi kaha jaataa he, greek shabd, arthath - ‘do dhaage’) syneptonimal complex avakramit ho jaataa he or samarupi chromosome ek duusare se jaraa dur ho jate hai
 The chromosomes themselves also open up, causing some transcription of DNA
 lekin, prayek bivalent ke samarupi chromosome crossingover ke kshetron, kiyasmata par balpurvak bandhe hote hai
 Chiasmata persist on chromosomes until dissociated into anaphase I
 maanav bhrun dimbujanan main viksit ho rahe sabhi dimb is avasthaa tak viksit hote hai or janm ke pehle yah vikaas book jaataa he
 This suspended state is called the Dictyotene condition and remains so until puberty
 nar main yauvanarambh main ardhasutrivibhaajan ke shuru hone tak keval shukranujan rahete hai
 In the diakinesis state, which in Greek means 'transfer', the chromosomes are further condensed
 is meiosis jahaan tetrads ke chaar bhaagon main dikhaai de rahe hai vastav main pehla bindu he
 Cross-entanglement together, effectively overlapping sites, making chiasmata clearly visible
 isko chhodkar, is dasha kaa baaki bhaag bilkul sutrivibhaajan ke prometafez ke samaan hi hota he, upakendrak gaayab ho jate hai, kendrakeey jhilli putikaaon main parivartit ho jaati he tathaa ardhasutrivibhaajanik tarku banane lagata he
 In these cases, two asterisks that pair with asterisks of animal cells migrate to both poles of the cell
 ye tarak kaay jo S-avasthaa main pratikrut hue the, sookshmanalikaaon, jo vastav main koshikeey rassiyaan or khambe hai, ke kendrakikaran karne vaale sookshmanalika sanghathan kendron kaa kaam karte hai
 Microtubules invade the nucleus after the nucleus is destroyed and connect the chromosomes to the chromosome
 gunasutrabindu ek motor kii tarah kaam karata he-vah chromosomon ko sanlagn sookshmanalikaaon ke saath tarak kaay kii ore khinchataa he, jaise koi train patari par chalati he
 Each tetrad has four chromosomes, but the pair of chromosomes on each sibling chromatid combines and acts as a unit during meiosis I
 gunasutrabinduon se sanlagn sookshmanalikaayen gunasutri sookshmanalikaayen kehalaati hai
 Other microtubules interact with the microtubules of the opposing asterisks; These are called the apical microtubules or polar microtubules
 ek teesri prakaar kii sookshmanalikaayen, tarak sookshmanalikaayen tarak kaay se jeevadravya menjati hai yaa jhilli- kankal ke bhaagon se sampark karti hai
 Homologous pairs move along the metaphase plate
 jaise-jaise dono tarak kaayon se nikali gunasutribindu sookshmanalikaayen unase sambandhit gunasutribinduon se sanlagn hoti hai, samarupi chromosomon ke dono gunasutribinduon se utpann sookshmanalikaaon dwaara bivolenton par lagaae gaye aviral paraspar virdohi balon ke kaaran samarupi chromosome ek bumadhya tal main tarku ko katate hue vyavasthit ho jate hai
 The physical basis of the independent configuration of chromosomes is the random orientation of each bivalent on the metaphase plate against other bivalents along the same equator
 gunasutribindu sookshmanalikaayen choti hokar punahsangyojan parvon se alag ho jaati hai or samarupi chromosomon ko alag kar detii hai
 As each chromosome has the same active pair of chromosomes, all chromosomes are pulled towards the opposing poles, forming two haploid sets
 har chromosome main abhi bhi sahodara chromatidon kii ek jodi hoti he
 The apical point microtubules lengthen and push the asterisks away
 koshika centre ke neeche kii ore vibhaajan kii taiyaari main lambi hone lagati he
 The final meiosis effectively ends with the chromosomes arriving at the poles
 ab har putree koshika main chromosomon kii sankhya aadhi hoti he kintu har chromosome main chromatidon kii ek jodi hoti he
 The microtubules that make up the spindle network disappear, and each haploid set surrounds a new nucleus membrane
 chromosome khulkar punah chromatin main parivartit ho jate hai
 The degradation of cell membranes in animal cells or the formation of cell wall in vegetative cells is called cytokinesis, with the completion of the function of two daughter cells
 sahodara chromated tilofez 1 ke samay sanlagn bane rahete hai
 Cells may enter a state of relaxation i

 interkinesis or interfase II
 is avasthaa main diene kaa doharaana nahin hota he
 Meiosis II is the second stage of this process
 is prakriya kaa adhikansh bhaag sutrivibhaajan ke samaan hi hota he
 To that end, two haploid cells produced in meiosis i produce 4 haploid cells
 ardhasutrivibhaajan II ke chaar mukhya kadam hai-profez II, metafez II, anaafez II or tilofez II
 In prophase II, both the subculture and the centripetal crystals are disrupted and at the same time the chromatids become smaller and macro
 tarakkaay dhruviya kshetron kii ore chale jate hai tathaa tarku ke reshon ko dwitiya ardhasutrivibhaajan ke lique vyavasthit karne lagate hai
 In metaphase II, centromerers have two chromosomes that attach at each pole to the spherical fibers of asterisks
 nai bhumadhyarekhiy metafez plate ardhasutrivibhaajan i kii tulana main pichhali plate se 90 degree par gum jaati he
 This is followed by anaphase II, in which the centromere dislocates, allowing microtubules attached to the cytoplasm to pull apart the chromatids
 vipakshi dhruvon kii ore badhate sahodara chromatidon ko ab sahodara chromosome kaha jaataa he
 The process is terminated with telophase II, which is similar to telophase I, and the chromosomes open up and elongate and the spindle disappears
 kendrik aavaran punah banate or vibhajit hote hai yaa koshika-bhitti nirmaan antat kul chaar putree koshikaon kii utpatti karata he, jisamen prayek main chromosomon kaa ek agunit set hota he
 Meiosis is now complete and four new daughter cells are produced
 ardhasutrivibhaajan sthir langik prajnan kaa maarg prashast karata he
 At conception without multiplying or halving chromosomes, zygotes are produced that have double the number of chromosomes from zygotes of the previous generation
 kramik pidiyon main aisa hone par chromosomon kii sankhya main bhayankar vruddhi ho jaaegi
 saamanytah dwiguneet jeevon main bahugunitha, yani teen yaa adhik chromosome seton kii upasthiti, ke kaaran teevr vikaas vikaar hote hai
 adhikansh pashu jatiyon main bahugunitha ko sahan nahin kiya jaataa
 lekin podhe saamanytah upjau, jeevaksham bahugunak paidaa karte hai
 Multiplicity has been considered an important process in vegetation
 samarupi chromosomon kaa punahsangyojan or swatantra vinyas janata main ginotipon kii adhik vividhta kaa kaarak hota he
 This leads to genetic diversity in gametes, thereby promoting genetic and phenotypic diversity in the offspring
 ardhasutrivibhaajan 1 main chromosomon kaa saamaanya pruthakkikaran yaa ardhasutrivibhaajan II main sahodara chromatidon kaa pruthakkikaran disjunkshan kehalaata he
 When dissociation is not normal, it is called nondisjunction
 iske parinamswaroop aise yugmakon kii utpatti hoti he jinamein kisi vishisht chromosome kii sankhya bahut zyada yaa bahut kam hoti he or trisomi yaa monosomi kii saadhaaram prakriya he
 Nondisjunction can occur in meiosis i or meiosis II, in stages of cellular reproduction, or during mitosis
 yah manushyon main hone vaali kai bimariyon kaa kaaran he : In females, meiosis occurs in cells called oocyte
 prayek dimbanuprasujan jo ardhasutrivibhaajan kii shuruuaat karata he, do baar vibhajit hokar ek ekal dimbjan or do dhruviya kaayon kii utpatti karata he
 However, before these divisions occur, these cells stop at the diplotene stage of meiosis i and lie dormant within a protective covering of somatic cells called a follicle
 ye coop kupjnan naamak ek prakriya dwaara sthir gati se viksit hone lagate hai or inamen se kuch masik chakra main pravesh kar jate hai
 Menstruated ovations continue meiosis i and remain on meiosis II until conception

 According to Lumbert and Cooper, managers of the process of product development and commercialization must do the following: vinirmaan prakriya vitaran, channelon ko pichley purvanumaan ke aadhaar par utpaadan or utpaadon kii aapurti karata he
 Manufacturing processes need to be flexible to market changes and mass customization must be adjusted
 Customer demands are met at just-in-time ie minimum consignment sizes at the right time
