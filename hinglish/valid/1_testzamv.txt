 Damayanti was the only daughter of the King of Vidarbha
 vah bhi bahut sundar or gunwan thi
 Nal began to love her after listening to her beauty
 unke prem kaa sandesh damyanti ke paas badi kushalta se pahunchaaya ek hans ne
 And Damayanti also started burning in the face of her unknown lover
 is katha main prem or pidaa kaa aisa prabhaavshaalee put he ki bharat ke hi nahin desh-videsh ke lekhak va kavi bhi isse aakarshith hue bina na rah sake
 By translating Bop into Latin and into English poetry by Dean Milman, the West has also been well acquainted with this tale
 vidarbha desh main bhismak naam ke ek raja rajya karte the
 His daughter's name was Damayanti
 damyanti lakshmi ke samaan rupavati thi
 At the same time, Nishal's son Nils ruled in Nishad country
 ve bade hi gunavan, satyawadee tathaa brahman bhakt the
 Those who came from the country of Nishad to Vidarbha praised the qualities of Maharaj Nal
 yah prashansa damyanti ke kaanon tak bhi pahaunchi thi
 Similarly, people coming from Vidarbha country would discuss the form and qualities of princess in front of Maharaj Nal
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki nal or damyanti ek-duusare ke prati aakrisht hote gayi
 In the Mahabharata, on the insistence of Dharmaraja Yudhishthira, Maharishi Brihadeva told the story of nal-damayanti
 dharmraj ! nishadh desh main virasen ke putr nal naam ke ek raja ho chuke hai
 He was very talented, supremely beautiful, truthful, Jitendriya, beloved of all, Vedas and Brahmin devotees
 unki sena bahut badi thi
 
 ve swayan astravidya main bahut nipun the
 They were brave, warrior, benevolent and irresistibly valiant too
 unhen jua khilne kaa bhi kuch-kuch shauk tha
 In those days, a king named Bhima ruled the country of Vidarbha
 ve bhi nal ke samaan hi sarvagun sampann or parakramee the
 He pleased the sage Daman and received four children from his boon — three sons and a daughter
 putron ke naam the—dam, dant, or daman
 The daughter's name was Damayanti
 damyanti lakshmi ke samaan rupavati thi
 His eyes were huge
 devataaon or yakshon main bhi waisi sundari kanya kahin dekhne main nahin aati thi
 In those days, how many people would come from Vidarbha country to Nishad country and would tell the form and quality of Damayanti in front of King Nal
 nishadh desh se vidarbha main jane vaale bhi damyanti ke saamne raja nal ke rup, gun or pavitra charitra kaa varnan karte
 Thus, mutual affection sprouted in both of their hearts
 ek din raja nal ne apane mahal ke udyaan main kuch hanson ko dekha
 They caught a goose
 hans ne kaha—‘aap mujhe chhod dijiye to ham log damyanti ke paas jaakar aapke gunon kaa aisa varnan karenge ki vah aapako avashya var legi
 'nal gave up laughing
 ve sab udakar vidarbha desh main gayi
 Damayanti was very happy to see her swans and started running towards them to catch the swans
 damyanti jis hans ko pakadaney ke liye daudti, vahi bol uthta ki ‘ari damyanti ! nishadh desh main ek nal naam kaa raja he
 She is as handsome as Ashwini Kumar
 manushyon main uske samaan sundar or koi nahin he
 It is as if idol is Cupid
 yadi tum uski patni ho jaao to tumhaara janm or rup donon safal ho jaayan
 We have seen the gods, gandharvas, humans, snakes and demons roaming around like a tap, but a beautiful man could not be seen
 jaise tum striyon main ratna ho, vaise hi nal purushon main bhushan he
 The pair of you two will be very beautiful
 ’ damyanti ne kaha—‘hans ! tum nal se bhi aisi baat kahana
 'hans returned to Nishad country and told the message of Damayanti from the tap
 damyanti hans ke munh se raja nal kii kirti sunakar unase prem karne lagi
 Her attachment grew so much that she would keep paying attention to them day and night
 sharir dhoomil or dublaa ho gaya
 She started looking down sakhiyon ne damyanti ke hriday kaa bhav tadkar vidarbharaj se nivedan kiya ki ‘aapaki putree aswasth ho gayi he
 'king Bhima thought big about his daughter
 ant main vah is nirnay par pahunche ki meri putree vivaahyogy ho gayi he, isaliye iskaa swayamvar kar dena chaiye
 He sent a invitation letter to the swayamvara to all the kings and informed them that the kings should take advantage by visiting the swayamvara of Damayanti and fulfill my desire

 He also traveled to Vidarbha country to join Damayanti's Swayamvara
 devataaon ne swarg se utarate samay dekh liya ki kaamdev ke samaan sundar nal damyanti ke swayamvar ke liye ja rahe hai
 Like the sun of the tap, the deities too were amazed by the Kanti and extraterrestrial appearance
 unhone pahichaan liya ki ye nal hai
 He parked his planes in the sky and came down and said to the tap - 'rajendra Nal! You are very Satyavrati
 aap ham logon kii sahaayta karne ke liye doot ban jaaiye
 'nal pledged and said' i will '
 phir poocha ki ‘aap log koun hai or mujhe doot banaakar koun-sa kaam lenaa chaahate hai ?’ indra ne kaha—‘humlog devtaa hai
 i am Indra and these are Agni, Varuna and Yama
 ham log damyanti ke liye yahan aaye hai
 The Gods told Nal that you should become our messenger and go to Damayanti and say that Indra, Varuna, Agni and Yamdevata want to come to you and marry you
 inamen se tum chaahe jis devtaa ko pati ke rup main sweekaar kar lo
 Nal said with both hands that 'devraj'! There is only one purpose for you and me to leave
 isaliye aap mujhe doot banaakar vahaan bhejein, yah uchit nahin he
 Whoever has a desire to get a woman as a wife, how can he leave her and go to her and say such a thing? You guys please forgive me about this damyanti kaa swayamvar hua jisamen na keval dharti ke raja, balki devtaa bhi nal kaa rup dharkar aa gaye
 The swayamvara had several taps standing simultaneously
 sabhi pareshaan the ki asli nal koun hoga
 But Damayanti was not deterred at all
 usne ankhon se hi asli nal ko pahchaan liya
 All the gods also greeted him
 is tarah ankhon main jhalkate bhaavon se hi damayanti ne asli nal ko pahachaanakar apana jeevanasathi chun liya
 The newly-married couple received the blessings of the gods
 damyanti nishadh-naresh raja nal kii maharani bani

 Pride could never touch her

 Both children were blessed with beautiful looks and qualities as per their parents

 Though Maharaja was a man of tap quality, godliness and virtue, but there was a flaw in him - addiction to gambling
 nal ke ek bhai kaa naam pushkar tha
 He lived separately from the tap
 usne unhen jue ke liye aamantrit kiya
 The game started
 bhagya pratikul tha
 Nal started losing, gold, silver, chariot, Rajpat all got out of hand
 maharani damyanti ne pratikul samay jaanakar apane donon bacchon ko vidarbha desh kii rajdhani kundinpur bhej diya
 Here, he lost his everything in null gambling
 unhone apane sharir ke saare vastrabhushan utaar diye
 Came out of the city wearing only a garment
 damyanti ne bhi maatr ek sari main pati kaa anusaran kiya
 One day King Nal saw some birds with gold wings
 raja nal ne sochaa, yadi inhen pakad liya jaay to inako bechakar nirvaah karne ke liye kuch dhan kamaaya ja saktaa he
 Thinking this, he opened his clothes and threw them on the birds
 pakshi vah vastra lekar ud gayi
 Now Raja Nal was left with no clothes even to cover his body
 nal apni apeksha damyanti ke dukh se adhik vyakul the
 One day both of them were hiding under the same cloth under a tree in the forest
 damyanti ko thakaavat ke kaaran neend aa gayi
 King Nal thought, Damayanti has to bear great grief because of me
 yadi main ise isi avasthaa main yaheen chhodkar chal don to yah kisi tarah apane pitaake paas pahunch jaaygi
 Considering this, he cut half of her sari with a sword, and by covering her body with it and leaving Damayanti in the same state, they left
 jab damyanti kii neend tuuti to bechaari apane ko akelaa paakar karun vilaap karne lagi
 Disturbed by hunger and thirst, she suddenly went to the dragon and the dragon swallowed it

 But the hunter was evil by nature
 usne damyanti ke soundarya par mugdh hokar use apni kaam-pipaasa kaa shikaar bananaa chaha
 Damayanti said while cursing him- 'if i have never thought of any other man except my husband King Nal, then the life of this sinful hunter should be ended now
 damyanti kii baat puri hote hi vyaadh mrityu ko praapt hua
 While wandering deviously, Damayanti reached Chedinresh Subahu one day and then to her father

 Many anthropomorphic qualities like mercy, compassion, etc
 are within the limits of natural justice, but the court cannot compel anyone to show mercy

 In the same context, he said that this court will implement the rights prescribed by law, for which the ordinary law of the country is not sufficient
 at: 'suniti' prakritik nyaay kaa vah ansh he, jo nyaayalayon dwaara karyanvit hone yogya rahane par bhi aitihaasik kaarnon se kaaman lau ke nyaayalayon dwaara karyanvit ne hone ke kaaran 'chanceri' nyaayalay dwaara lagu kiya jaataa tha
 Otherwise there is no difference between 'suniti' and 'common Law' in terms of fact
 pracheen kaal main naitikta evam kanoon paraspar mili hue the evam 'dharm' ke vyapak arth main sannihit the
 There are four sources of Hinduism - Veda, Smriti, Virtue and Suniti
 suniti ke siddhant 'nyaay' main antarnihit rahe hai
 In spite of the vivid details of the word of memory and virtue, all the questions of justice have been taken for granted to the accepted rules and fantasies of law and the impression of Suniti on them is clear
 smritikaron ne sweekaar kar liya tha ki sanathan dharm swabhaavat: vyapak nahin ho saktaa
 Therefore, the principles of 'justice' have to be implemented in different circumstances

 bharat main angreji shashan sthapit hone par is desh ke nyaayalayon ke nirnay antim apil ke rup main privi council ke adhikarashetra main aane laga
 Thus, the influence of Suniti developed in England began to be reflected in Hindu legislation
 privi council ne kentuva ve girimalpya 519 e, 368 main yah nirnay kiya ki yadi koi kisi kii hatya kar de to vah vyakti mritak kii sampatti kaa adhikari nahin hoga
 The above rule based on public policy was implemented in the case of Hindus from the point of view of justice and Suniti
 sansar ke bhinn-bhinn deshon main jahaan pichhali kai shatabdiyon main angreji shashan rahaa he, unke nyaayalayon ke nirnay par angreji suniti kaa prabhaav spasht he

 madhya yug main england ke raja kaa sachivalay 'chanceri' kehalaata tha evam uskaa adhikarish 'chancelar' ke naam se vikhyath tha
 The last chance of justice was dependent on the 'chancery' king, despite the courts staying to decide cases in the country
 at: chanceri main bahudhaa aisa aavedan aane laga ki aavedak daridr, vruddh or rugn he; kintu uskaa vipakshi dhani evam shaktishaalee he
 He therefore fears that the opposition will bribe the jury; By his sovereignty he will fear them; Or he has cleverly created a situation that the ordinary court of the country will not be able to give him justice
 aisa aavedan praaia: karun shabdon main bhagwaan or dharm kii duhai It was written by giving chancelar raja ke naam pradesh nikaalkar vipakshi ko apane samaksh upasthit karaane lage
 He had to take an oath and answer the application
 san 1474 i
 se chancelar swatantra rup se nirnay dene lage evam chanceri nyaayalay main suniti kaa vikaas yaheen se aarambh hua
 Chancery's popularity began to grow
 iskaa mukhya kaaran yah tha ki chancelar aise maamalon kaa niraakaran karne lage, jinke liye saadhaaran nyaayalay main koi vidhaan nahin tha
 One can take the trust for illustration
 kramash: chal, durghatana, 'chanceri' dastavej gum hone ke prasang main tathaa vishwasghaat bhi uske adhikaar kshetra main aa gaye
 In the early seventeenth century, a dispute arose between the courts of Chancery and the common law questioning their jurisdiction; But it was finally recognized that the decision of the Court of Chancery would be paramount
 is prasang main yah smaraneey he ki chanceri nyaayalay ne kaaman lau ke nyaayalayon par pratyaksh shashan nahin kiya
 He only guaranteed the successful plaintiff not to implement the immoral decision
 ukt donon prakaar ke nyaayalayon ke vikaas ke saath-saath chancelar ke adhikaar bhi simit hote gaye
 The doctrines of Suniti were based on which rights outside the purview of common law were based and for which diagnosis was required
 san 1873-75 i
 ke abhyantar nirmit kanoon ke dwaara 'suniti' evam kaaman lau kii do vibhinn paddatiyaan ek ho gayi
 As a result, the Courts of Common Law started issuing injunctions and the Chancery Court began to indemnify the ejaculation of the contract, as was not possible in the past
 arthath ab desh ke kisi bhi nyaayalay main kaaman lau evam suniti donon ke nidaan ek saath praapt hone lage
 After 1775 AD, if there is an abnormality between Suniti and Common Law rules in any case, then the law of Suniti will be recognized
 kintu yah smaraneey he ki suniti kaa yah uddeshy nahin tha ki vah desh ke saadhaaran kanoon ko nasht kare, varan uski kabhi kii purti karnaa hi iskaa lakshya tha
 For example, trust injunction, fulfillment of contract, and management of estate of deceased person are contributions of Suniti
 in vishyon ke liye kaaman lau ke nyaayalay main koi nidaan nahin tha
 This rule is the basis of Suniti
 iskaa aashay yah he ki yadi koi harakat aisi he, jiske liye naitik drushti se nyaayalay ko traan dena chahie, to nyaayalay traan avashya degaa
 The Chancery Court began on this basis
 nyaas kaa kanoon is prasang main ek upyukt drushtaant he
 The Samuel Allen & Sons Ltd
 In 1 Chancery 575 a company bought a machine on the condition of rent-purchase
 yah tay hua ki antim kist aada kar dene tak mashin kaa swatvadhikari iskaa vikreta rahegaa evam use adhikaar rahegaa ki vah kist tuutane par mashin ko uthaakar le jaae
 The machine was installed in the company's business house, so the machine was owned by the company by common law
 peeche company ne ukt makaan girvee main ek aise vyakti ko diya, jise mashin se sambandhit 'kiraaya-kharid' kii koi soochna nahin thi
 a case occurred in which the court ruled that the right to take away the machine was equitable title to the land
 chunki kram main isaki sristi pehle hui, at: makaan ke girveedaar ke adhikaar kii apeksha isaki praathamikta he
 If a person builds a house on the belief that the land belongs to him, and the real owner of the land does not make the other person aware of the actual situation even after seeing the house being built, then the real owner of the land, without giving a reasonable price for the house, will be built
 Can't get jis vyakti ne sachche vishwaas se makaan banaaya, uskaa us sampatti par makaan sambandhi kharch ke liye purvadhikaar rahegaa
 a minor took money from the trustee with the intention of cheating him, saying that he was an adult

 When he was an adult, he again asked the trustee for the said amount
 yadhyapi naaballig kii raseed pakki nahin maani jaati, phir bhi nyaayalay ne kaha ki trustee dubaara ukt rakam dene ko jimmedaar nahin he
 Where the claim is too old and neither party has submitted to regain its title and has accepted the opposition's trespass due to its inaction, Suniti will not help in such a situation
 kintu kanoon dwaara nirdhaarit maamla chalaane kii avadhi ko manyata degi
 But if the evidence by which the defendant responds to the case is destroyed due to the plaintiff's failure, then the delay will be fatal

 If the property is divided in such a way that a gets one part, b gets five parts and c gets six parts, but c cannot take his part, in such a case, according to accruer clause, C's parts are equally a and b will receive
 arthath prayek ko teen-teen atirikt bhaag milenge evam moulik vibhaajan kii asamanta kii prakalpana lagu nahin hogi, kyonki samta hi suniti he
 This principle is at the core of the trust based on the words of mortgage, penalty, seizure and persuasion
 jab yah prashn uthta he ki koi sampatti rehan main di gai he yaa is vikalp ke saath bech di gai he ki bikri karne vaala ise pun: kharid saktaa he, to aisi sthiti main suniti yah dekhati he ki mulya bikri kii drushti se paryaapt he yaa nahin
 Whether or not the so-called buyer occupied the property
 isi prakaar kisi sanvida main aisi shart rahe ki isaki purti nahin hone par doshi paksh ko puri shaasti deni hogi to suniti yah dekhati he ki shaasti kii rakam sanvida kii purti karaane ke nimitt rakhi gai thi yaa yah kshatipurti kii rakam he
 If the plaintiff has completed his part in a fundamental contract in the belief that the defendant will also complete his part, in such a case the court often orders that the defendant also complete his part as it would be unjust for the defendant not to do so
 isi prakaar yah siddhant samparivartan ke mul main bhi parilakshith hota he
 The background of this theory is historical
 aarambh main chanceri nyaayalay prativaadee kii sampatti main hastkshep nahin karata tha
 Only he was ordered to do justifiable work
 yadi prativaadee aadesh kaa paalan nahin karnaa to nyaayalay use avamaan ke liye dandit karata tha
 His property was also confiscated
 ab bhi suniti kaa mul kshetradhikaar vaadi kii upasthiti par nirbhar he
 If the property of the case is outside the jurisdiction of the court, but the defendant is in the jurisdiction or he can also be summoned for the case and the plaintiff has moral right in the case, then the court will proceed against the defendant
 kintu yadi bhoomi main tittle kaa prashn he tathaa bhoomi nyaayalay ke kshetradhikaar se baahar he to nyaayalay us vishay kaa nirnay nahin karegaa

 Yung's 'introverted' and 'extroverted' personality-type and blurr's perceived 'introverted' person's instinct - 'duality', etc
 are famous

 a relatively more predominant one is representative of the 'type' of personality
 'dwaidhbhav' main kabhi to donon vrittiyon kaa santulan rahata he, jo ki adarsh sthiti hoti he, kabhi donon ore baari-baari besakhta dhul jane kii sthiti hoti he
 The last is 'dualism' in its peak

 macdougall criticized 'dualism', saying that it can never be placed on the practical standard of living of ordinary people because in special circumstances it lies in us as a hidden possibility; On the contrary, it can be said that every human mind is single and organized perfection
 dow prince ke purv elicot ne sarvapratham tak aise rogi kaa vaigyanik vivaran prakashit kiya tathaa po ne sarvapratham 76 rogiyon ke drushtaanton kaa sahitya prastut kiya
 Subsequent psychologists placed less emphasis on 'blocks' and more on mental unity

 Superhuman states like sleepwalking are manifestations of this hidden power person
 
 In the story style of Yung, Chaitanya becomes impotent in front of the sovereignty arising in 'unconscious'

 This also leads to emergence of accidental eccentricities in everyday life

 During the Second World War, he enlisted in the Indian National Army, through which he fought the British with the Japanese

 From 1947 to 1953, he was a reporter for newspapers like Hindustan Times and The Statesman
 1953 se 1957 tak inhone bhartiya kendriya radio evam jan mantralay main kaary kiya
 From 1957 to 1959 he worked at the US Embassy of India
 jise ve "bhartiya itihaas kaa hamalaavaron evam upniveshkon dwaara pakshpaati evam todaa maroda gaya vrittant" maanate the, use sahi karne main unmatta, ok ne kai pustaken or bhartiya itihaas se sambandhit lekh likhe hai
 Along with this, he established the Indian History Review Institute on 14 June 1964
 ok ke anusaar, aadhunik or marxvaadi itihaaskaaron ne bhartiya itihaas ke "adarshikrut vrittant" ko kalpit karke usamen se saare vaidic sandarbh or saamagree hataa diye hai
 Oak's contributions try to prove the supremacy and immense superiority of Hinduism over other religions
 jahaan ok ke siddhanton kaa kai hindu vaadi guton ne bharpoor prasar evam samarthan kiya he, vahiin, kisi bhi mukhyadhara ke dharmik evam sthapaty itihasvidon dwaara sweekaar nahin kiya gaya he
 According to Edwin Bright, most readers consider him only a rumor
 apni pustak tajmahal: satya katha main, ok ne yah daawa kiya he, ki tajmahal, multah ek shiv mandir yaa ek raajapootaana mahal tha, jise shahjahan ne kabza karke ek makbare main badal diya
 Oak says how buildings from Kashmir of all Hindu origins to Kanyakumari have been added to some Muslim ruler or his courtiers, by altering or without alteration
 unhone humayu kaa makbara, akbar kaa makbara evam itmaduddaula ke makbare, tathaa adhikansh bhartiya hindu aitihaasik imaaraton, yahan tak ki kaaba, stonhenj va vatican shahar
 Till date, they are of Hindu origin
 ok kaa bharat main muslim sthapaty ko nakaarna, marathi jag-prasiddh samskruti kaa atyant muslim virdohi angon main se ek bataaya gaya he
 KN Panikkar described Oak's work in Indian nationalism as a communal understanding of Indian history
 tapan raichoudhary ke anusaar, unhen sangh parivaar dwaara aadarneey itihasvid kaha gaya he
 Oak has claimed that Hindu decorations and symbols have been removed from the Taj and the chambers in which those objects and the original temple's Shiva Linga have been hidden have been sealed
 saath hi yah bhi ki mumtaj mahal ko uski kabr main dafnaaya hi nahin gaya tha
 In support of these claims, Oak has given the results of carbon dating of the wooden doors of the Taj's Yamuna River, the Hindu architectural / architectural features of the Taj are also cited in the descriptions of European travelers
 unhone yahan tak kaha he, ki taj ke nirmaan ke aankhon dekhe nirmaan vivaran, vittiya aankade, evam shahjahan ke nirmaan aadesh, aadi sabhi keval ek jaal maatr hai, jinka uddeshy iskaa hindu udgam mitaanaa maatr he
 PS Bhatt and AL Athawale have written in the "history Magazine" that Oak's articles and material raise many related questions on this subject
 pi0en0 ok apni pustak "tajmahal e hindu temple" main sau se bhi adhik kathith pramaan evam tark dekar daawa karte hai ki tajmahal vastav main shiv mandir tha jiskaa asli naam 'tejomahalay' hua karata tha
 Oak Sahib also believes that this temple was built by Raja Mansingh of Jaipur, which was broken and built Taj Mahal
 is sambandh main unke nimna tark vichaarneey hai: Oak filed a petition in which he declared the Taj a Hindu monument and opened tombs and sealed chambers, and to see if they contained the remains of the Shiva Linga, or other temple
 Appealed to
 unke anusaar bhartiya sarkaar ke is krity kii anumati na dene kaa arth sidhe-sidhe hindu dharm ke viruddh shadyantr he
 In 2000, the Supreme Court of India quashed Oak's plea that the Taj was built by a Hindu king and also rebuked him that there was a worm in his mind for the Taj
 san 2005 main aisi hi ek yachika elahabaad ucch nyaayalay dwaara bhi radd kar di gayi, jisamen amarnath mishra, ek saamaajik kaaryakarta dwaara yah daawa kiya gaya tha, ki taj ko hindu raja parmaar dev ne 1196 main nirmaan karaayaa tha
 Contrary to his accepted history, Mr
 Oak has claimed that both Islam and Christianity are twisted forms of Vedic religion
 inke samarthan main unhone ek shabdaawalee bhi bataayi he
 For example, the Sanskrit root word for Islam is Ishalayam = Ish + Alay = House of God, which is different from the meaning described in Islam) and many similarities in Hinduism and Islam or Christianity are stated in support of this view
 unhone daawa kiya he, ki makka main kaaba multah ek shiv mandir tha
 And the papacy was a Vedic post, until Constantine killed an insignificant Christian pope by killing him there

 dwinetri kaa upyog parthiv vastuon ke dekhne main hota he, isliye yah aavashyak ho jaataa he ki is prakaar ke dwinetri main vastu kaa sidhaa pratibimb bane
 Galilee varieties of vision make direct reflections
 isliye saadhaaran dwinetri doordarshee ke nirmaan main isi prakaar ke doordarshee kaa upyog hota he
 Ordinary binocular telescopes are called theatrical binoculars
 telescope ke vipareet doorabeen upyogkarta ko tri-aiami chhavi prastut karaati he: apekshaakrit nazadik kii vastuon ko dekhte samay darshak kii donon ankhon ke liye thode se alag drushtikon se chhaviyaan prastut hoti hai jo ki mil kar gaharaai kaa prabhaav prastut karti hai
 Unlike monocular telescopes, it does not require an eye to be closed or covered to avoid confusion
 donon ankhon ke prayog se drushtisambandhi tivrata kaaphi bad jaati he or aisa kaaphi dur kii vastuon ke liye bhi hota he jahaan gaharaai kaa abhas spasht nahin hota
 The first binocular visionary was created in 1608 by Leperhe
 yah upkaranika do samaantar aksh ke doordarshiyon kaa yugma thi
 The Galileo variety of telescope has two main drawbacks: 1
 iskaa drushtikshetra vistrut nahin hota tathaa 2
 Its magnification capacity is not high
 kepler kism ke doordarshiyon ko khagoli doordarshee kehete hai
 The Kepler telescope is better than the Galileo telescope in terms of detail and magnification of the field of view, but the Kepler telescope could not be used to make binocular telescopes because the image is inverted
 poro ne ek aise triparshv sangyojan kaa nirmaan kiya jo kepler doordarshee main bane hue ulte pratibimb ko kshaitij or urdhvadhar donon dishaao main sidhaa karke dikhaa saktaa he
 The above invention of Poro is very important in the development of binocular epithelium
 poro ke triparshv sangyojan main do samakon triparshvi ko is prakaar joda jaataa he ki unke karn prishth ek duusare ke sampark main rahete hai or unke purna paravartan prishth paraspar samakonik hote hai
 After Porro, Abe specifically considered the question of tripartite compounds
 aadhunik triparshv dwinetri ke vikaas par aibe ke anusandhanon kaa vishesh prabhaav padaa he
 It is a combination of two telescopes of the Kepler variety, in which the inverted image formed by the visionary's vision makes the two right-angled isosceles trilateral
 ye triparshv doordarshee ke abhidrishyak or upanetra ke bich main sthit rahete hai
 The way in which the reflection in the horizontal and vertical directions is perpendicular to the trilateral is shown in Figure 1

 vastu se ai hui prakashakiran abhidrishyak le1 main se guzarane ke baad pratham triparshv par takaraati he
 The turn cores of this tripartite are vertical, making it perpendicular to the horizontal plane
 pratham triparshv se nikalne ke baad prakashakirane duusare triparshv par girti hai, jisaki vartak kor kshaitij sthiti main rahati he
 This makes the reflection in the vertical plane straight
 duusare triparshv se nikalne ke baad prakashakirane upanetra le2 main pravesh karti he
 This direct reflection is magnified by the subnet
 triparshvon ke kaaran doordarshee kii nalika kii lambaai paryaapt kam ho jaati he
 It is a pair of two microscopes in which the reflection is straightened with the help of trilateral
 isaki visheshta yah hoti he ki isse vastuon ke thospan kaa anubhav hota he
 The experience of distance or depth of two adjacent objects depends on the difference between the eye and the objects
 donon netron ke retinaon par bane hue pratibimbon main kuch antar hota he or isi bhinnata ke kaaran gaharaai yaa thospan kaa anubhav hota he
 The range of stereoscopy ranges from 1,250 to 1,600 yards

 Two photographs of the object are taken from two lenses located at the same distance as the distance between the eyes
 ab in donon photon ko is tarah vyavasthit kiya jaataa he ki dahini aankh keval dahini ore ke lens se lee hui photo ko hi dekh sake or duusari photo ko na dekh sake
 This system is called a stereoscope
 aisa lagata he ki 17veen sadi main telescope ke avishkaar ke saath hi aise do telescope ko saath laga kar unase praapt hone vaali bainocular drushti ke laabhon ko khoja jane laga
 The earliest telescopes used Galilean optics; She used a convex objective lens and a concave eyepiece lens
 gallilian dizin kaa yah phayda he ki praapt chhavi sidhi hoti he parantu drishy kshetra sankara hota he tathaa iskaa aavardhan bahut adhik nahin hota he
 This type of construction is still used in very cheap models and in opera glasses and theater glasses
 keplarian prakaashiki kaa prayog karte hue ek behatar chhavi or ucch aavardhan praapt kiya ja saktaa he, isamen objective lens se praapt chhavi ko dhanatmak ipis lens se dekha jaataa he
 a disadvantage of this configuration is that the received image is inverted
 in kamiyon ko dur karne ke kai tareeke hai
 The Poro Prism telescopes are named after Italian optics scholar Ignazio Porro who patented the image correction system in 1854 and later improved in the 1890s by manufacturers such as Carl Zeiss
 is prakaar kii doorabeen jed ke aakaar ke dohare poro prism vaale vinyas kaa prayog chhavi ko sidhaa karne main karti hai
 Using this feature it is possible to make wide telescopes with objective lenses that are far enough away but are adjusted by the eyepiece
 poro prism dizin kaa ek or laabh yah he ki inamen prakaash path chota ho jaataa he jiske kaaran doorabeen kii vaastavik lambaai objective lens kii focal lambaai se choti ho jaati he tathaa donon objective ke bich kii badi hui duuri ke kaaran gaharaai kaa behatar ehsaas hota he
 The design by Ashley Victor Emil Dobres in 1870 resulted in telescope based prism
 adhikansh ruf prism aadhaarit doorabine yaa to ebbe-konig prism athwa shmit-pechan prism kaa prayog chhavi ko sidhaa karne tathaa prakaash path ko chota karne ke liye prayog karti hai
 These have objective lenses that are approximately in line with the eyepiece
 ruf prism dizine ki sahaayta se aise upkarnon kaa nirmaan ho paata he jo patale tathaa poro prism kii tulana main chote hote hai
 There is also a difference in the brightness of the image
 poro prism aadhaarit doorabeenon main samaan aavardhan, vastu aakaar tathaa samak prakaashiki gunvattta vaali ruf-prism aadhaarit doorabeenon ke mukaable adhik chamak vaali chhavi praapt hoti he, aisa isliye hota he kyonki ruf prism dizine main rupahali sataha kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jo ki prakaash ke sancharan ko 12% se 15% tak kam kar detii he
 Roof prism design telescopes also require more precision in the alignment of their optical elements
 aise main inaki keemat bad jaati he kyonki unki dizine unhen factory main hi kuch nishchit ghatakon ke saath ucch colimation par set kiye jane par aadhaarit hoti he
 In binoculars with poro prism, their prism sometimes has to be reoriented so that collimation can be recovered
 sthir rekhan vaali ruf dizine kaa arth yah hua ki unhen aamtaur par dobaaraa kabhi punah colimation kii aavashyaktaa nahin padegi
 The visionary is usually designed for a specific application
 ye vibhinn dizin kuch vishisht optical maapdand utpann karte hai ye maapdand hai: The ratio obtained by dividing the focal length of the eyepiece by the focal length of the objective is called the linear magnification power of the telescope
 For example, being in multiples of magnification power 7, it is as if the person watching is watching the object being viewed 7 times closely
 aavardhan kii maatra isapar nirbhar karti he ki doorabeen kis anuprayog ke liye banaayi gayi he
 Since the telescopes used in handhelds have low magnification, they are less sensitive to vibration
 adhik aavardhan hone se drishy kshetra chota ho jaataa he
 The diameter of the objective lens determines how much light can be collected to form an image
 yah sankhya sidhe pradarshan ko prabhavit karti he
 When the magnification and quality are equal, the larger the second number of binoculars, the brighter and clearer the image obtained is
 is prakaar ek 8X40 dwaara praapt chhaviyaan 8X25 kii tulana main adhik ujjwal tathaa spasht hongi, haalanki donon hi kisi chhavi ko aath guna hi bada karengi
 Large front lenses in 8x40 will produce large masses of light that go into the eyepiece
 Thus viewing from an 8x40 would be more comfortable than an 8x25
 yah aamtaur par millimetre main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 It is customary to classify telescopes as the diameter of the magnification x object, for example 7X50
 kisi doorabeen kaa drishy kshetra uske optical dizine dwaara nirdhaarit hota he
 It is expressed by a linear value, such as how many feet of width will be seen when viewed from 1000 yards, or how many degrees of angular value can be seen
 objective dwaara praapt prakaash ko doorabeen ek punj ke rup main kendrit karti hai, exit pupil jiskaa vyas objective ke vyas ko aavardhan shakti se vibhajit karke praapt kiya jaataa he
 For best light reception and bright image, the exit pupil should be the size of the pupil of a fully expanded human eye that is about 7 mm and decreases with age
 agar doorabeen se nikalne vaala prakaash shanku us aankh kii putali ke aakaar se bada hoga jisame ise pravesh karnaa he to, putali ke aakaar ke atirikt ajo bhi prakaash he vah vyarth ho jaayegaa arthath uske madhyam se netron ko koi soochna nahin milegi
 din ke samay aankh kii putali lagbhag 3 mimi fail jaati he jo ki 7X21 doorabeen ke exit pupil ke baraabar hoti he
 Larger 7x50 binoculars create a larger light cone than the pupil, which becomes unusable during the day
 isliye ek bade upkaran ko saath lekar chalanaa vishesh upyogi nahin lagata
 haalanki, ek bada exit pupil se netra ko us sthaan par rakhana aasaan ho jaataa he jahaan se ise prakaash mil sake: prakaash shanku main kahin bhi aankh lagaayi ja sakati he
 This ease of setting the eye prevents the image from obscuring, which can be in the form of blackness or blurring when the path of light is partially blocked
 or, iskaa yah matlab bhi he ki chhavi ko jaldi se dhundha ja saktaa he jo pakshiyon yaa pashuon ke adhik gatisheel khelon ko dekhne ke dauraan mahatvapurn he
 Telescopes with narrow exit pupils can get fatigued quickly because the instrument needs to be right in front of the eye to get the correct image
 ant main, kai log apni doorabeenon kaa prayog shaam ke samay, dhundhalake ke samay, tathaa raat main karte hai jab unki putaliyaan badi hoti hai
 Thus, the daytime exit pupil is not always the most useful standard
 suvidha, upyog main aasaani or anuprayogon main vibhinnata ke liye badi doorabine jinamein bade exit pupil hon, santusht karne vaale vikalp hote hai, haalanki din main unki kshamta kaa puri tarah prayog nahin ho paata
 Eye relief is the distance between the exit pupil or eye point from the previous eyepiece lens
 yah vah duuri he jo dekhne vaale ko ipis se apni aankh ke bich rakhni hoti he jisase use ek spasht chhavi praapt ho sake
 The larger the focal length of the eyepiece, the greater the eye relief
 doorabeenon main ai relif kuch millimetre se lekar 2
5 centimetre athwa usase bhi adhik ho sakati he
 Eye relief is particularly important for glasses wearers
 chashma pahanane vaale vyakti kii aankh aamtaur se doorabeen ke ipis se dur hoti he jisaki vajah se yah aavashyak ho jaataa he ki doorabeen kii aai relif adhik ho jisase ki vah vyakti puraa drishy kshetra dekh sake
 Telescopes with small eye relief can be more difficult to use where they find it difficult to hold stability
 nikat focus duuri vah kam se kam duuri he jahaan doorabeen focus kar sakati hai
 This distance can range from 1 meter to 30 meters and depends on the design of the telescope
 chunki doorabeenon kaa prayog jin vastuon ke dekhne main kiya jaataa he ve kisi nishchit duuri par nahin hoti hai, atah unamem focus karne kii vyavastha hona aavashyak he jisase drushti tathaa objective lenson kii duuri ko badla ja sake
 Traditionally, two different arrangements have been used for focusing
 jin doorabeenon main "swatantra focus" kii vyavastha hoti he, unamem do alag-alag telescopon ko swatantra rup se unke ipis se focus kiya jaataa he
 Traditionally heavy field experiments, for example for military applications, have used independent focus telescopes
 chunki saamaanya prayogkarta doorabeenon ke donon tubon ko ek hi samaayojan se focus karnaa adhik suvidhajanak pate hai, ek duusare prakaar kii doorabine "kendriya focus" kaa prayog karti hai jinamein ek kendriya focus karne vaala pahiyaa laga hota he jisase donon tubon ko ek saath samyojit kiya ja saktaa he
 Additionally, the two eyepieces can also be adjusted to compensate for the difference in the viewer's eyes
 The focal change that occurs when the eyepiece is rotated into its mount is measured in the diopter, the prevailing unit of refraction power, so many times the eyepiece that can be adjusted is also called a "diopter"
 kisi vyakti vishesh ke liye yah samaayojan kiye jane ke baad alag alag duriyon par sthit vastuon ko dekhne ke liye focus karne vaale pahiye kii sahaayta se donon tubon ko focus kiya jaataa he or ipis ko dobaaraa samyojit nahin karnaa padataa he
 In most modern telescopes, the distance between the two different telescopes can also be changed with the help of an occupying structure that allows them to be set according to the distance between the two eyes of different people
 adhikansh vayaskon kii donon putliyon kii bich kii duuri ke anukool bani hoti he
 Many telescopes are "focus free" or "fixed focus", with no focusing mechanism
 unka dizine sthir drishy kshetra ke liye hota he jo apekshaakrit nikat kii vastuon se lekar anant tak hota he jisamen ek badi hyperfocal duuri hoti he
 These designs are considered to be compromised designs, it has convenience, but those things which are outside their range depending on their design, they are not seen properly
 kuch doorabine samaayojan yogya aavardhan pradaan karatin hai, inhen zum bainocular kehete hai, inkaa uddeshy prayogkarta ko ek hi doorabeen rakh kar usase "zum" liver kaa prayog karte hue vibhinn aavardhan str praapt karnaa hota he
 This requires a complex series of lens adjustments, as in zoom camera lenses
 ye dijin samjhauta athwa hatkandaa samajhe jate hai kyonki ye doorabeen main vishaal aakaar, jatilta tathaa najukta ko badha detii hai
 The complex optical path reduces the field of view and reduces the brightness at high zoom levels
 is prakaar ke modelon main zum kii puri paraas main, donon ankhon ke liye baraabar aavardhan rakhana aavashyak hota he tathaa ankhon ko tanaav va thakaan se bachaane ke liye samantaran bhi rakhana hota he
 Using image stabilization techniques in telescopes, the image can be saved from moving and high magnification can be used
 ve kal-purze jo chhavi kaa sthaan badalte hai ve urja se chalane vaale jiroscope athwa aisi yantriki se dridhtaapurvak sthir rakhe jate hai jo jiroscope yaa sthayitv jaanchane vaale yantro kii sahaayta se sanchalit ho, kai baar unhen aise lagaaya jaataa he ki ve kampan gati ke prabhaav ke vipareet kriya karte hai
 Stabilization can be started or stopped as desired by the user
 in takneekon se doorabeen ko 20X tak ke aavardhan ke saath haath main pakde ja sakane yogya banaaya ja saktaa he, saath hi kam shakti vaale upkarnon main chhavi sthirikaran kii gunvattta ko bhi badhaaya ja saktaa he
 There are also some drawbacks: After putting the best telescopes that do not use stabilization on the tripod, the picture obtained from them is much better, as well as stabilizing telescopes are expensive and heavier than telescopes that do not use their equivalent stabilization
 
 acchhee tarah se samaantarit doorabeen ko, maanav ankhon se dekhe or maanav mastishk dwaara sansaadhit kiye jane par, ek ekal, spashtatya tri-aiami chhavi dikhni chahie or aisa nahin laganaa chahie ki vah thode se alag drushtikon se do alag-alag tasviren dekhi ja rahi he
 In the absence of this adaptation, there may be delusional discomfort and visual fatigue, but the field of vision can still be seen as a whole
