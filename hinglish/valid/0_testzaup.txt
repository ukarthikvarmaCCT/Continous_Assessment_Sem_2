 Sixty years ago, when literacy levels were low and English-educated Tamils despised writing in Tamil, the circulation of 'kalki' touched 71,000 copies — the largest for any weekly in the country

 On the one hand, critics mean that Kalki's novels did not emphasize the common people, giving great importance to royalty
 or unke kathankon me jo achaanak ghumaav or mode he, ve kahaniyon ko avastavik bana dete he
 However, in recent years, there has been a re-evaluation of Kalki, especially among Marxist critics

 After a successful run for six weeks, this film directed by K
 Subramaniam was banned by the colonial government

 Almost all of Kalki's novels were first published in serial form and then only in book form

 Kalki's interest in history, the features of her historical novels and her popularity, have inspired others to enter this vast and new field and contribute outstanding acts

 The Tamil Nadu government has decided to nationalize the works of Kalki, so that publishers can now reprint the works of Kalki

 or raja umrao singh ke saath 1857 kii kranti me hissaa liya tha 
 Due to which he was hanged on Bulandshahr black mango by the British in the Ring Leader Act
 unke saath anya 84 krantikariyon ko bhi faansee par lataka diya gaya tha 
 Majlis Zamindar Luharli's son's name was Nathua Singh Bhati
 nathua singh bhaati ke bete kaa naam bhikki singh bhaati tha 
 He was a revolutionary and many times he had to go to jail for freedom
 ve kai baar tihaad jail bhi gaye the 
 Bhikki Singh Bhati was given a copper letter on 15 August 1972 by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
 or teen pansion jo namak aandolan ,azaad hind fuj ,or satyagrah ke liye milti thi 
 Bhikki Singh had three sons
 mahavir singh,randhir singh,or sarvajit singh tha 
 Delhi was captured by the British on 11 September 1803
 lekin angrejon or unke pisthuo kii lut khasot kii niti ke chalate 1857 tak bhatner ke tamaam ilaake kii khushhaali lakhori iton kii chand chaar diwario main simat kar rah gayi thi 
 On one side the grain was lying in the godowns, on the other hand, without the grain mill dust would accumulate in the house of a farmer called Grain Annadata
 kisaan majdoor gaajar muuli shakargandi aalu saag aadi ke mil jane par hi mahasoos karata tha ki use jindagi kaa sahaara mil gaya 
 However, the farmers used to work in their fields with hard work and dedication
 lekin jab fasal kaa anaaj uthaakar ghar laane kaa samay aata 
 Only then did the actions of the British friends coming to collect rent
 unase jo kuch anaaj bachataa use sood khor mahajan le jaataa 
 Before harvesting the crop, the farmer would either eat the raw grain and eat a little, or he would bring the grain which was hidden in the straw bale
 uski bhi roti kai-kai din chod kar banaain jaati 
 She would also have to fill the stomach with the rest of the song, divided into one or two pieces of bread, or when a guest came and made bread for her, then the roti after her dinner was sliced and given to the children of the house
 kisi vazah se barish na hui or khet suukh kar fasal barbaad ho gai yaa baadh se fasal bah gai to bechaare kisaan kii shamat hi aa gai 
 The landowners who collected the rent and took the buffalo and oxen of the Mahajan's lathis, and the lathis fell in disguise at the poor
 isi vajah se aam hindustani kisaan majdoor angreji sarkaar ke alaava unke agenton jameendaar or sood khor mahajanon se zyada dukhi tha 
 This was the reason that when the rebellion broke out in the black platoon from Meerut, the common rural people especially the Gurjars also joined
 us vaqt tak aazaadee jindabad kaa naaraa izad nahin hua tha 
 These were the only slogans of these people
 angreji sarkaar ko ukhaad phenko sarkaar ke agenton ko maar bhagaao unke kothi bangale gira daalo 
 Book accounts in which our forefathers are mortgaged and their debts are charged even after generations
 unhe jala daalo yahi gussa tha in dehati majdoor kisaanon ko tabhi to yah log jameendaaron sahukaaron kii haveliyo ke kivaad choukhat jungle tak ukhaad laae the 
 Well, what was the use of the people who lived in thatched houses, they looted all these things? Bringing these things to the village was a burden to die for free
 1857 kii is jang main ek baat kaabile gaur he ki vah yah kii us vaqt main gurjar bhi sarkari ohadedaar or jameendaar the 
 But there is not a single Gurjar who does not jump into this fire
 jabaki duusari kaumon ke log kuch idhar to kuch udhar the 
 The only drawback was that this revolution failed
 varanaa aise josh or jazbe main angrejo se kai pradesh khaali karaaen ja sakate the 
 The moneylender who used to open his chest in such a tumultuous situation for Rajawada or East India Company did not have the spirit of patriotism and not a single one helped the revolutionaries
 1857 kii kranti kii jang main shaamil hone vaale anek gurjar jamidaaron ke naam maujuud hai lekin yahaan ham luhaarli gaanv ke gurjar jamidaar majalis ji kaa zikr kar rahe hai yah bhi unhi rahamdil jamidaaron main se the jo kisaanon se munasib bhi lagaan vasuulate the 
 Apart from this, he used to make a concession on the condition of his farmer
 you to majalis jamidaar pehle din se hi kranti kii jang main shaamil the lekin til begumpur kii mahapanchayat main jab raav umrao singh ko kranti kii jang ke mahanayake yani dadri bhatner ke raja chun liye gaye the tab majalis jameendaar ne bhi angreji sarkaar ko ukhaad phenkane kii kasam uthaai thi or apane aasapaas ke noujvaan krantikariyon ko shaamil karke jelly sena banaai thi krantikariyon ke liye ek hathiyaar bhi thi or paracham bhi kyonki yahi dur se nazar bhi aa jaati thi jidhar jelly sena chali dete
 All the revolutionaries would walk there and follow the declaration they made
 raav umrao kii cameti kii taraf se jo hukum diya jaataa yah vahi karti
 In the battle of the revolution of 1857 in the Jelly Army, he played a very important role
 bulandshahr kii jail par hamalaa karke krantikariyon ko chhudaaya gaya

 The revolutionary army continued to compete with the English army for seven days
 19 may 1857 ko vir krantikari sena ko shastr angrezi sena ke saamne hathiyaar daalane pade iora 46 vir krantikario ko giraftaar kar bandi bana liya gaya i For the important contribution of Gujjar society in this revolutionary army, they had to become a part of the wrath of British power
 And the people of Gurjar society were chosen and elected to be arrested
 21may 1857 ko umrao gurjar apane dal ke saath bulandshahr pahuche jila karagaar par dhaava bolkar apane sabhi krantikari saathiyo ko chhudaa liya i Bulandshahr began to see the end of English rule, but it did not happen due to the arrival of English army
 31 1857 ko ghaziabad jile ke hindon nadi ke tat par ek aitihaasik yuddh hua i In which Mirza Mughal Rajinhal Sing or Walidad Khan along with other villagers also joined this war with their weapons

 Shia is a Muslim sect
 sunni sampradaay ke baad yah islam kaa doosraa sabase bada sampradaay he jo puri muslim aabaadi kaa keval 15% he
 After the death of Hazrat Muhammad in 632, the people who chose Hazrat Ali as their Imam and Khalifa in their spirit were called Shiyane Ali who are now called Shias
 lekin bahot se sunni inhen "shiya" yaa "shiyane ali" nahin balki "rafazi" naam se bulaate hai ! According to this religious ideology, Hazrat Ali, who was both a cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad Saheb, was the real heir of Hazrat Muhammad Saheb and should have become the first Khalifa
 yadhyapi aisa hua nahin or unako teen or logon ke baad caliph, yani pradhan netaa, banaaya gaya
 Ali and then his descendants should have become the chief of Islam, a Shia who believes so
 sunni musalmaan maanate hai ki hazarat ali sahit pehle chaar khaliph satpathi the jabaki shiya musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki pehle teen khaliph islam ke gaiyr-vaazib pradhan the or ve hazarat ali se hi imaamon kii ginati aarambh karte hai or is ginati main caliph shabd kaa prayog nahin karte
 Sunni Muslims also consider Ali as the Khalifa and Khalifa Yajid, who killed his son Hussain, is called a misguided Muslim in many places
 is sampradaay ke anuyaayiyon kaa bahumat mukhya rup se iraan,iraq,bahrain or azarbaijan main rahete hai
 Apart from this, Syria, Kuwait, Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Oman, Yemen and India also have Shia population as a major minority
 shiya islam ke vishwaas ke teen upkhand hai - barahwaree, ismaili or zadi
 In a famous hadith Munkunto Maula Fah Ja Ali Un Maula, which Muhammad Sahab had opened on his last hajj at a place called Ghadir, the Muslim community had to follow the community's dictum
 san 632 main muhammd sahab ne apane aakhri haj main khumm sarovar ke nikat apane saathiyon ko sambodhit kiya tha
 According to Shia faith, he made his son-in-law Ali his heir in this title
 sunni is ghatana ko ali kii prashansa maatr maanate he or vishwaas rakhte hai ki unhone hazarat ali ko caliph niyukt nahin kiya
 Differences between the two sides begin about this
 haj ke baad mohammad sahab biimaar rahane lage
 He called all the big sahabis and said, give me a pen claim that i should write such a statement that if you don't stumble, Omar said that he is saying hejyaan and did not let it
 shiya itihaas ke anusaar jab pigambar sahab kii mrityu kaa samachar mila to bhi ye waapas na aakar sakipha main sabha karne lage ki ab kya karnaa chaiye
 At the time when Hazrat Muhammad died, Ali and some of his other friends were engaged in burying Muhammad saheb, Abu Bakr went to Medina and discussed for Khilafat
 madina ke kai log abu bakar ko khalipha banane par sahamat ho gayi
 According to Shia beliefs, Mohammad Saheb and Ali's clan i
e
 Hashim Ali wanted to make Khalifa only
 par islam ke ab tak ke sabase bade samrajya ke vaaris ke liye musalamaanon main ekajutata nahin rahi
 According to many, Ali, who was the cousin of Muhammad Saheb and son-in-law, was also the real heir of Muhammad Saheb
 parantu abu baqar pehle khalipha banaaye gayi or unke marane ke baad umr ko caliph banaaya gaya
 This caused more fury among the supporters of Ali, but Ali remained silent for the good of the Muslims
 umr ke baad tisare khaliph osman bane
 But during his time, the Shia Rafazi rebels came from Egypt and Iraq and other places in Medina and surrounded Osman's house for 40 days and finally besieged Usman's house
 osman bin afphan ko jab shahid kiya gaya tab unki umr 79 thi, unhen sar main baar baar waar kar ke maaraa gaya unki patni unako bachaane bich aayi isse unki oongali cat gayi, baghi unke ghar main peeche kii taraf se andar aaye ,saamne ke taraf hazarat ali ke donon bete hossain ibne ali or hasan ibne ali ,rakhwali kar rahe the ! The Caliphate was now vacant again and the Islamic empire was growing
 musalamaanon ko hazarat ali ke alaava koi na dikhaa par ali khaliph banane ko na maane
 On some days the people of Shura could not fill the post of Khalifa
 ant main ali ko vivash kiya gaya to aap ne kaha ki mere khilaafat main ilaahi nizaam chalegaa
 He was appointed the fourth Khalifa
 ali apane insaaf ke liye mashhoor the ,ali ke khalipha banane par purv khalipha osman ke kaatilo kaa badla lene or unako sajaa dene kii maang uthne lagi lekin vakht or musalamaanon ke halaat dekh kar ali ne us vakht koi kadam nahin uthaaya par logo ko ye na raas aayaa to unhone osman ke kaatilo ko sajaa dilwane ke fouz ikkthi kii
 Ali said Usman's Katillo would be punished, but his purpose was something else, so there was a war called Jamal
 kuch samay baad syria ke soobedaar muavia ne bhi ali kaa virodh kiya
 Mu'awiya was a relative of the third Khalifa Usman and the battle for the punishment for the slayer of the same Usman led to a war in Siffin, in which Mu'awiya also lost
 san 661 main kufa main ek masjid main imam ali ko dhoke se shahid kar diya gaya
 After this Mu'awiya declared himself the Caliph of Islam
 hazarat ali or saidhantik rup se mohammad satho sahab ke rishtedaaron ke samarthakon ne unke putr hasan ke prati nishtha dikhaai, lekin kuch unka saath chhod gaye
 Hasan Ibne Ali did not fight, but made a treaty with Mawiya

 He was the governor of Syria because of the previous caliphs, now he was preparing a large army, now he put the same question in front of Imam Hasan: either war or subjugation

 After the partition of India on 17 August 1947, the Radcliffe Line became the border between India and Pakistan
 sar siril redcliff kii adhyakshata main seemaa ayog dwaara rekha kaa nirdhaaran kiya gaya, jo 88 karod logon ke bich 175,000 varg mile kshetra ko nyyochit rup se vibhajit karne ke liye adhikrut the
 On 15 July 1947, the British Parliament's Indian Independence Act 1947 stipulated that the British Raj in India would end just one month later on 15 August 1947
 It also designated the partition of India into two sovereign-endowed independent colonies: the Union of India and the independent colony of Pakistan as the homeland of Muslims in British India
 pakistan musalamaanon kii mathrubhumi ke rup main abhipret tha, jabaki bharat hindu bahumat ke saath dharmanirpeksh tha
 In the north, Muslim dominated areas were going to become Pakistan
 baluchistan ke praant or sindh puri tarah pakistan ko saunp die gaye
 However, the two provinces did not have a uniform majority - Bengal in the North East and Punjab in the North West)
 The western part of Punjab became a part of West Pakistan and the eastern part became the Punjab state of India
 isi prakaar bengal kaa vibhaajan purvi bengal or pashchimi bengal main kiya gaya
 After independence, the north-west Frontier Province chose to join Pakistan through a referendum
 punjab kii jansankhya kaa vitaran kuch aisa tha jisamen aisi koi rekha nahin thi jise karine se hindu, musalmaan or sikhon main vibhajit kiya ja sake
 isi tarah, koi rekha jinna ke netritv main muslim lig ko, evam nehru tathaa patel ke netritv main bhartiya rashtriya congress or saath hi saath british ko santusht nahin kar saki
 iske alaava, kisi bhi vibhaajan ke liye "sadak or rail sanchaar, sinchai yojanaayen, vidyut pranaliyaan or jot kshetron ko kaatna" aprihaary tha
 However, a well-drawn line could reduce cases of separating farmers from their fields and save millions from relocating
 jaisaa ki ghatit hua "samgr up-mahadweep main, kuch 14 karod logon ne apane ghar chhod die or har sambhav saadhan dwaara - hawaii, rail or sadakon ke madhyam se, kaaron or lauriyon main, bason or baiylgaadiyon main, par adhikanshtah paidal - apane jaise logon ke paas sharan paane ke liye nikal pade"

 Prior to the replacement of Lord Louis Mountbatten as Viceroy in February 1947, a crude border line had already been drawn by the Viceroy of India, Lord Wavell
 sahi taur par yah nirdhaarit karne ke liye ki kis desh ko koun se pradesh abantit kiye jaaen, june 1947 main, britain ne do seemaa aayogon kii adhyakshata ke liye - ek bengal or ek punjab ke liye - sar siril redcliff ko niyukt kiya
 The commission was instructed to "demarcate the boundaries of the two parts of Punjab on the basis of the examination of the contiguous areas with majority of Muslims and non-muslims
 While doing so, they should also take other factors into account
" Other factors were undefined, which exempted Radcliffe, but included decisions about "natural boundaries, communications, waterfowl and irrigation systems" as well as social and political views
 prayek ayog main chaar pratinidhi the - 2 bhartiya rashtriya congress se or 2 muslim lig se
 donon pakshon ke hiton ke bich gatirodh ko dekhte hue or unke vidweshpurn sambandhon ke kaaran, antim nirnay anivarytah redcliff kaa tha
 After arriving in India on 8 July, Radcliffe was given only 5 weeks to decide about the border
 jald hi unhone apane college ke bhootpurv chaatr mountbeton ke saath mulaaqaat kii or ayog ke sadasyon, visheshtah congress se nehru or muslim lig ke adhyaksh jinna se milane ke liye lahore or kalakatta kii yatra kii
 unhone nirdhaarit kam samay ke liye aapatti jataai, lekin sabhi dalon kaa yah aagrah tha ki 15 agast ko bharat se british vaapasi ke saath hi rekha khinch di jaae
 mountbeton ne sheeghra samay-seemaa kii shart par vysarai kaa pad sweekaar kiya tha
 The decision was concluded just days before the withdrawal, but due to political manipulations, it was not published until August 17, two days after India and Pakistan were granted independence
 vyavsaay se vaqeel rahane vaale, redcliff or anya ayuktaon ko paas sabhi chamak-damak thi lekin is vishesh kaary ke liye aavashyak gyaan nadaarad tha
 They had no advisors to inform the well-established procedures and information required to draw the boundary
 or naa hi surveykshan or kshetreey jaankaree ekatrit karne kaa samay tha
 To avoid delays, there was a deliberate absence of some experts and advisors, such as the United Nations
 britain kii nai lebar sarkaar "jo yudghakaalin baari karz main dubi hui thi, bas apane teji se asthir hote samrajya ko or adhik bardaasht nahin kar paa rahi thi
 "" The absence of external participants - for example, the United Nations - also satisfied the British government's willingness to save money that it needed external help to run - or to end - governance in its own empire
 " bhartiya rashtriya congress or muslim lig ke netaaon ko diya gaya baraabar kaa pratinidhitiv gatirodh paidaa karne ke bajaay, santulan pradaan karata hua prathit hua
 The relationship had become so controversial that the judges "could hardly tolerate each other's talk" and there was so much difference in agendas that the discussion would have no meaning
 Even "a few weeks ago the wife and two children of a Sikh judge of Lahore were murdered by Muslims in Rawalpindi
 " In fact, reducing the number of Hindus and Muslims on the wrong side of the line was not the only concern for balance
 punjab seemaa ayog ko sikh samudaay ke kshetreey ghar ke bich se rekha khinchni thi
 Lord Isle was indifferent to the British for not being overly considerate of the community, which in his words "recruited several thousand illustrious recruits to the Indian Army during World War I"
 " baharhaal, sikh kisi bhi aise samaadhaan ke prati apane virodh main ugr the jo unke samudaay ko muslim shasit rajya main rakhe
 iske alaava, kai logon ne apane swayan ke samprabhu rajya kaa aagrah kiya, jis par koi sahamat nahin hota
 Finally, there were communities that had no representation
 bengal seemaa ayog ke pratinidhiyon ko mukhyatah is sawaal par chintaa thi ki kalakatta kise milegaa
 bengal main chatgaanv pahari ilaaqon ke buddha janajatiyon kaa koi aadhikarik pratinidhitiv nahin tha or vibhaajan ke do dinon baad tak apni sthiti se jujhane ke liye koi jaankaree unke paas nahin thi
 Recognizing the situation to be difficult and urgent, Radcliffe made all the difficult decisions himself
 This was impossible from the beginning, but Radcliffe seems to have had no doubt in himself and did not raise any official complaint or proposal to change the circumstances
 apni niyukti se pehle, redcliff ne kabhi bharat kaa daura nahin kiya tha or vahaan kisi ko nahin jaanate the
 For the British and quarrelsome politicians, this shortage appeared beneficial; Apart from Britain, they were treated as impartial to any party
 keval unke nijee sachiv, christopher bumont, punjab ke prashasan or jivan se parichit the
 To maintain a show of fairness, Radcliffe also kept his distance from Viceroy Mountbatten
 gyaan kii koi maatra aisi rekha banane main safal nahin ho saki jo takaraav hone se bachaae; pehle se hi, "punjab or bengal ke sampradayik dangon ne british kii twarit or sammanjanak vaapasi kii ummid ko feekaa kar diya tha"
 "dakshin asia ke kai upniveshottar vikaron ke beej, pratyaksh or paroksh british shashan kii do sadiyon main, bahut pehle hi boe gaye the, lekin, jaisaa ki har pustak ne darshaya he, vibhaajan kii jatil traasadee kaa koi bhi ansh aprihaary nahin tha
 " agar ayog or adhik saavdhaan hota, vibhaajan main baari bhuulon se bachaa ja saktaa tha
 For example, there are many incidents where the boundary line was drawn such that some part of the village remained in India and some part in Pakistan
 chunki redcliff ke paas sirf ek maheene kaa samay tha, unhone gaanvon kii simaaon ke maamle main saavdhaanee baratane ko nazarandaaz kiya
 Their border, instead of passing between two densely populated territories, passed right through their middle
 There are many instances where the dividing line passed through a house with some rooms left in one country and others in another country
 redcliff ne aise laaparvaahee se kiye gaye vibhaajan ko ghisi-pity baat se jaays tehraaya ki bhale hi ve kuch bhi karte, logon ko to bhugatna hi padataa
 is auchity ke peeche kii soch kabhi prakat nahin hogi kyonki redcliff ne "apane bharat chhodane se pehle sabhi kaagazat nasht kar die"
 ve swatantraaa diwas par hi chale gaye, isse pehle ki seemaa adhinirnay vitarit kiye jate
 apni hi sweekaarokti main, redcliff bhartiya jalwaayu ke prati apane swasthya kii kami or bharat chhodane kii utsukata se vishesh taur par prabhavit the
 The implementation was no less quick than the borderline drawing process
 17 agast ko redcliff adhinirnay prakashit hone se pehle, bhartiya or pakistani pratinidhiyon ko 16 agast 1947 shaam 5:00 baje, pratiyon ke adhyayan ke liye do ghanton kaa samay diya gaya
 The division was done in secret to avoid disputes and delays
 antim adhinirnay 9 agast or 12 agast ko taiyaar the, lekin vibhaajan ke do din baad tak prakashit nahin kiye gaye
 According to Reid, some circumstantial evidence exists that Nehru and Patel were secretly informed of the contents of the Punjab award on August 9 or 10, possibly through Mountbatten or through Radcliffe's Indian assistant secretary
 yah kaise ghatit hua bina iskaa lihaaj kiye, adhinirnay main satluj nahar ke mukhya purvi bhaag ko pakistan ke bajaay bharat ke adhikaar-kshetra main daalane ke liye parivartan kiya gaya
 The area had two Muslim-majority tehsils with a combined population of five lakhs
 is parivartan ke liye do spasht kaaran the: is kshetra main sena ke hathiyaaron kaa depo maujuud tha or isamen bharat ke hisse main aane vaale rajasi pradesh bikaner ko sinchit karne vaali nahar kaa nadishirsh tha
 Similarly, it is not known how Radcliffe was persuaded to hand over the Chittagong Hill Tracts to Pakistan
 yah patel or nehru ke liye ek jhatka tha jo yah maan rahe the ki ye kshetra bharat ko saunp die jaaenge kyonki vahaan basane vaale 98% log gair muslim the
 Similarly, the decision of the Muslim majority districts of Murshidabad and Malda in Bengal was also kept secret where the residents hoisted the flag of Pakistan till the public publication of the award on 17 August 1947
 ye nirnay kaise liye gaye is baat kii sachai kabhi gyaat nahin hogi, kyonki redcliff ne saare abhilekh nasht kar die or mountbeton ne spasht rup se kisi vishesh jaankaree yaa pakshpaat se inkaar kar diya
 After the partition, the fledgling governments of India and Pakistan were left with the responsibility of enforcing the border
 agast main lahore kaa daura karne ke baad, vysarai mountbeton ne jaldi se lahore ke aas-paas shanti banaae rakhane ke liye punjab seemaa bal kii vyavastha kii, lekin hazaron logon kii hatya ko rokane ke liye 50,000 log kaafii nahin the, jinamein 77% gramin kshetra se the
 Given the size of the area, less than 1 per square mile of military force was accounted for
 yah shaharon kii suraksha ke liye paryaapt nahin tha or yahi baat aage pakistan kahalaane vaale pradeshon main apane gharon ko chhod kar jane vaale hazaron-lakhon sharnaarthiyon ke kaaravaan ke liye sateek baithti he
 Both India and Pakistan were reluctant to violate the agreement by supporting rebellion in villages lying on the wrong side of the drawn border, as it would have to hide the shame on the international stage and require the intervention of British or United Nations Could
 antat, seemaa sangharshon kii vajah se 1947, 1965 or 1971 main teen yuddh hue, saath hi may 1998 main dohare parmaanu hathiyaaron ke pareekshan or 1999 kaa kargil sangharsh saamne aayaa
 There were two major disputes regarding the Radcliffe Line, Chittagong Hill Tract and Gurdaspur District
 Some sporadic disputes about Malda, Khulna and Murshidabad in Bengal and Karimganj sub-division of Assam came to light
 chatgaanv pahari ilaakon main 97% tak bahusankhyak gair-musalamaanon kii aabaadi thi, lekin yah pakistan ko saunp diya gaya
 The Chittagong Hill Tracts People's Association filed a petition before the Bengal Boundary Commission, as most non-muslims settled in Chittagong wanted to stay in India
 Because no official representation was made to them, there was no official discussion on the matter and many people believed that CHT would be handed over to India
 15 agast 1947 ko, kai janajatiyon ko pataa nahin tha ki unka sambandh seemaa ke kis ore ke desh se hai
 After publication of the Radcliffe Award on 17 August, CHT was transferred to Pakistan
 pakistan ke hisse main chatgaanv pahari ilaako ko daalane kaa tark yah tha ki ve bharat ke liye durgam the or chatgaanv ko kuch ubhaypratirodhi kshetra, pramukh shahar or bandargah uplabdh karaane ke liye aisa kiya gaya; yah bhi tark diya gaya tha ki keval pahunch chatgaanv ke madhyam se tha
 "two days later, the CHTPA resolved not to abide by the award and the Indian flag was hoisted
 pakistani sena is virodh se nipati lekin samasya kaa samaadhaan abhi tak nahin hua he
 " up-prabhag shakargarh ke sivaay, gurdaspur jila bharat ko diya gaya
 The Gurdaspur district included the cultural centers of the historic Islamic city of Deoband, Barelvi and the Ahmadiyya community
 gurdaspur jile main musalamaanon kaa maamuli bahumat tha kyonki ahmadiya samudaay kii ginati musalamaanon ke rup main kii jaati thi, bhale hi musalmaan maulaviyon ne unhen gair-musalmaan ghoshit kiya tha; is kshetra main badi sankhya main ahmadiya ekatrit ho gaye the kyonki unka dharmik centre kaadiyaan gurdaspur jile main tha
 The overall Muslim and non-muslim ratio in the district was 50
6 and 49
4 respectively; Shakargarh and Gurdaspur each had a 51% majority in the tehsil; Batala tehsil had a majority of 53%; Pathankot Tehsil had a majority of 67% non-muslims
 ant main, keval shakargarh tehsil pakistan ko saunpa gaya, jisase shesh jile main gair musalamaanon kaa maamuli bahumat tha
 It was speculated that he was entrusted at the instigation of Lord Mountbatten, so that if the ruler of the state of Kashmir decided to integrate into the Indian Union, it would be accessible to India
 Whatever the case, the Pathankot tehsil would have gone to India and was directly connected by rail with the surrounding areas of Hoshiarpur and Kangra districts of East Punjab
 ek or baat yah thi ki batala or gurdaspur sikhon ke pavitra shahar amritsar ke liye pratirohak pradaan karte, jo anyathaa pakistan ke muslim ilaake se ghira hota
 antim baat mountbeton or anya logon dwaara seemaa ayog ke saamne daleel ke rup main prastut kii gai thi ki agar raavi nadi ke purvi kshetra ko ek khand ke rup main mana jaataa he, jisamen amritsar or gurdaspur jile kaa adhikansh bhaag shaamil he, to isamen gair musalmaan maamuli taur par bahusankhyak honge
 iske alaava, aisa karke, bahusankhyak sikh janasamudaay purvi punjab ke hisse main aa jayega; jabaki iske vipareet karne se, ek maamuli bahumat pakistan main chhot jayega or isse sikh sharnaarthiyon kii sankhya bad jaaegi
 yah sikhon ko shant karne kaa ek prayaas tha, kyonki unhone pashchimi punjab main kai pramukh ilaaqon ko kho diya tha
 In return, an attempt was made by Radcliffe to hand over Pakistan to the Ferozepur and Zira tehsils
 iskaa bikaner ke maharaja dwaara virodh kiya gaya kyonki sutluj or beas ke sangam par harike nadishirsh ferozepur main sthit tha, jahaan se ek nahar kaa udgam hua tha, jo ki unke registan rajya ke liye pani kaa ekmaatr strot tha

 Kiratarjuniyam is an epic poem written by Mahakavi Bharavi in the seventh century AD, which is ranked in the 'vrhatatrayi' of the epics in Sanskrit literature
 mahabharat main varnit kiratveshi shiv ke saath arjuna ke yuddh kii laghu katha ko aadhaar banaakar kavi ne raajnneeti, dharmaniti, kootneeti, samaajanneeti, yudhniti, janajivan aadi kaa manoram varnan kiya he
 This poem is filled with various juices, but it is predominantly a heroic work
 sanskrit ke chha: prasiddh mahakavy hai – brihattrayee or laghutrayee
 Kiratarajanayiyam, Shishupalavadham and Nashidhacharitam - are called Brihattrayi
 kumarasambhavam, raghuvansham or meghdutam - laghutrayee kehalaate hai
 Kiratarajuniyam is the only available work of Bharvi, which paved the way for a Sangopang epic
 magh-jaise kaviyon ne usee kaa anugaman karte hue sanskrit sahitya bhandar ko is vidha se samrudh kiya or ise nai oonchaai pradaan kii
 The stream of the epic, which appears in Kalidasa's miniatures and Ashwaghosh's Buddhacharitam, notwithstanding its distinct qualities, does not have the poise and totality that Bharvi initiated
 sanskrit main kiratarjunium kii kam se kam 37 tikaayen hui hai, jinamein mallinath kii tikaa ghantapath sarvshereshth he
 In 1912 Karl Kappler translated German into Kirtarajuniyam under the Harvard Oriental Series
 angreji main bhi iske bhinn-bhinn bhaagon ke chha: se adhik anuwaad ho chuke hai
 Due to Bharvi's special tendency in politics and behavior-policy, it was only reasonable that he would pick up the story of Kiratarajuniyam from the Mahabharata
 unhone vanaparv ke paanch adhyyon se pandavon ke vanvaas ke samay amogh astr ke liye arjuna dwaara kii gai shiv kii ghor tapasya ke falswaroop pashupathastra praapt karne ke chote-se prasang ko uthaakar use atharah sargon ke is mahakavy kaa rup de diya
 When Yudhishthira lost everything in the Dutekrida with the Kauravas, he had to go on a 13-year exile with his brothers and Draupadi
 unka adhikansh samay dwaitvan main beetaa
 Draupadi used to inspire Yudhishthira often to prepare for war and to withdraw his kingship from the Kauravas through war, dismayed by the hardships of exile and remembering the plot by the Kauravas
 bhim bhi draupadi kii baton kaa paksh lete hai
 a forester sent to Hastinapur as an undercover informs that Duryodhana is involved in the all-round development and consolidation of his united kingdom, as he feared the Pandavas for half the kingdom he had dealt with fraud and gaming
 pandavon ko bhi lagata he ki vanvaas kii avadhi samaapt hone par unka aadha rajya bina yuddh ke waapas nahin milegaa
 Draupadi and Bhima provoke Yudhishthira to immediately attack Duryodhana, not waiting for the period of exile to end, but unwilling to take the limits of idealistic, unforgiving Yudhishthira behavior
 udhar aa nikle vyas salaah dete hai ki bhavishya ke yuddh ke liye pandavon ko abhi se shakti-sanvardhan karnaa chahie
 According to the remedy given by him, Arjuna walks towards the Indrakil mountain in the Himalayas under the guidance of a Yaksha to appease Indra for asceticism
 vahaan ek ashram banaakar kii gai tapasya ke falswaroop apsaraon aadi ko bhejkar pariksha lene ke baad indra ek vruddh muni ke vesh main upasthit hote hai or tapasya ke nashwan loukik lakshya ko nidhsaar bataate hue parmarth kii mahatta kaa nidarshan karte hai
 Arjuna satisfies Indra by presenting the account of the deceit and injustice done by the Kauravas in its cut, the imperative of retaliation from the enemy, social duty and retaliation for injustice
 falswaroop indra apane vaastavik rup main prakat hokar arjuna ko manorath-purti ke liye shiv kii tapasya karne kii salaah dete hai
 Arjuna again engages in severe, uninterrupted penance
 arjuna indrakil ke liye ek ajanabi tapasvi he, jataa, valkal or mrigcharm to uske paas hai lekin saath hi sharir main kavach bhi he, yagyopavit kii jagah pratyancha-samet gandiv dhanush he, do vishaal tarkas hai or ek uttam khadg bhi
 Considering it to be anti-sageism, the other ascetics there are terrorized and reach Shankar for request
 uske kram main shiv ji kiraaton kii sthaneey janajati ke senapati kaa vesh dharankar kiraatveshdhari apane ganon kii sena lekar arjuna ke paas pahunch jate hai
 That is why a demon named 'mook' considers Arjuna's penance to be the work of the gods, holding the body of a giant sucker, and then hurries to kill him
 shiv or arjuna donon dwaara ek saath chalaae gaye ek-jaise baan se us boar kii igalila samaapt ho jaati he
 Shiva's arrow gets pierced into the earth piercing his body and when Arjun goes to remove his arrow from his body, Shiva sends one of his Ganes to raise a dispute
 parinamtah donon ke bich yuddh armbh ho jaataa he
 Arjuna forces the army of the Ganas to run away with arrows but is defeated in the war with Shiva
 paraajay se hataash arjuna kiraat-senapati ke vesh main shiv ko pahachaanakar samarpan kar dete hai, jisase prasann hokar shiv prakat hote hai or pashupathastra pradaankar uskaa prashikshan dete hai
 In this way, with the completion of Arjuna's intention, all the intentions of the epic genre are also proved
 kiraat veshdhari shiv ke is lokottar myth se itar is prasang kii apni ek vishisht janajaatiy abhivyanjana bhi he, jo is kavy ko vartmaan bhavabodh ke kareeb laati he
 The unwavering loyalty, indomitable boldness and high political understanding that Vancher reveals in the dialogue between Yudhishthira and gupta-turned-vancher leaves no room for doubt in India's favor towards the forest dwellers
 vanechar shuru main hi spasht kar detaa he— In the beginning of this whole episode, some proverbs have been uttered by Bhima towards Yudhishthira in support of Draupadi's talk
 unheen main se ek neeche uddhrit he: Bharavi is known for his sense of pride - 'upma Kalidasasya Bhaverirthagaurvam'
 is arth-gaurav se mail khaati ek vidagdh bhashaa or abhivyakti-kaushal unki smapda he
 He has an extraordinary penetration in diverse dimensions of life, including politics and behavior
 adarsh or vyavhaar ke dwandv tathaa yatharth jivan ke atirekon ke samaahaar se arjeet santulan unke lekhan ko ‘samastalokaranjak’ banaata he
 But Bharvi is basically a poet of life's irony and discrepancies, confronting him and trying to reconcile between his rough reality
 kiratarjunium ke pehle sarg main draupadi or duusare main bhim dwaara yudhisthir ko duryodhana ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke liye uksaane or yudhisthir dwaara use anithipurna bataakar asweekaar kar dene ke kram main bharavi ne raajnneeti ke do chhoron ke bich ke dwandv par bahut sarthak vimarsh prastut kiya he
 Similarly, in the eleventh canto in the place of salvation, Indra's tenacity for power and sovereignty is described as indescribable by Indra, as a response to Arjuna, Bharavi retaliated against injustice in life-practice, cosmic success, fame and self
 - The serious views given on the importance of respect, they present a picture of a balanced ideal of a healthy life
 bhashaa par apane apratim adhikaar ke chalate chitrakavy ke jis bhashik chamatkaar kii parampara bharavi ne shuru kii, unke baad ke kaviyon ke liye vah kasuti ban gai or magh main jaakar vah charmotkarsh par pahaunchi

 There are 18 cantos in Kiratarjuniyam
 kiratarjunium ke pehle sarg main draupadi or duusare main bhim dwaara yudhisthir ko duryodhana ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke liye uksaane or yudhisthir dwaara use anithipurna bataakar asweekaar kar dene ke kram main bharavi ne raajnneeti ke do chhoron ke bich ke dwandv par bahut sarthak vimarsh prastut kiya he
 In the third canto, Vyasa advises Bhishma, Drona, Karna-like men of the Kaurava side to invoke power in every way over a period of 13 years, describing them as invincible by the Pandavas, and to use them for preparing for a future war
 iske liye ve arjuna ko ucch koti ke shastrastra hetu tapasya se indra ko prasann karne ke liye prerit karte hai or apane saath laae ek yaksha ko bhi chhod jate hai jo arjuna ko indra kii tapasya ke liye upyukt sthaan tak le jayega
 In the fourth canto, there is a lively and interesting account of Arjuna's journey from Dvaitavan to the Himalayas under the guidance of the Yaksha, in which the euphoria and moderate nature of the autumn and the joy of the mixed life of the people is waved in many forms
 paanchavaan sarg yaksha ke saath arjuna ke yatra-prasang se giriraaj himalay ke parvatiy pradesh ke vishad, alankaarik varnan kii chata se deept he
 The theme of the sixth canto is: Indranil's unmatched beauty seen through Arjuna's eyes, Arjuna's initiation of penance, the various nature's contribution to asceticism, the deities stationed there, informing Indra by reaching Amaravati by Indra, Indra gives the Devangas their Go there with fellow Gandharvas and order to disturb Arjuna's penance with his gesture and beauty, so that his destruction Integrity can be tested
 saatven sarg main apsaraayen tathaa unke sahchar gandharv puure ullas-vilaas ke saath akaash maarg se vishesh prakaar ke haathiyon or rathon par savaar dev ganga ke kinare-kinare amravati se indrakil tak kii yatra karte hai
 After getting down near Indrakil, they make a divine camp like gandharva-nagari from their illusion on the majestic river Ganges
 aathvaan sarg main apsaraayen apane shiviron se van-vihaar ke liye nikalati hai
 From here, the color of Shringar Rasa begins to rise, which is thickened in the water sports described in this canto and reaches its culmination in the ninth canto, which is full of wine and drink
 dasavaan sarg apsaraon dwaara arjuna kaa dhyaan khinchakar use tapasya se chyut karne ke abhiyaan or uski asafalataa kaa he
 The eleventh canto depicts the arrival of Indra in the guise of the Veteran Muni and the futility of his worldly goal of penance, in response to which Arjuna makes his narrative of the values, priorities of cosmic life
 is sarg ke ant main arjuna ke tark se santusht devraj apane swaroop main prakat hokar uske lakshya ke anuroop shiv kii aradhana kaa upadesh dete hai
 In the twelfth canto, Arjuna starts austere penance, so that other saints get scared and go to Shankar
 shankar kiraat kaa vesh dharkar arjuna se milte hai
 In the thirteenth canto, both Arjuna and Kirat Rupadhari Shiva attack Sukar Rupdhari with arrows
 kiratarjunium ke antim paanch sarg apni gana-sena ke saath kiraatveshdhari shiv or arjuna ke bich yuddh ko samarpit hai
 In the 15th canto, in which this phase of the war comes, Bharvi has used Chitrakavya to introduce a new tradition within the realm of the epic
 kiratarjunium samalochakon ko atipriy he
 It has more than 42 commentaries
