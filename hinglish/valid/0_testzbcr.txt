 The swing is a practical example of this
 dolan karata hua lolak kisi ek bindu jitne samay baad punah waapas aa jaataa he use uskaa 'aavartkaal' kehete hai
 If the pendulum has a low amplitude, its periodicity does not depend on the amplitude but only on the pendulum's length and the local value of gravity acceleration

 Where l is the length of the pendulum, and g is the value of accelerated gravity at that location
 is sutara se saaf he ki yadi aayam kam ho to aavartkaal alag-alag ayaamon ke liye samaan hoga
 This property of pendulum is called 'synchronism'

 udhaaharan ke liye yadi aayam θ0 = 23° ho to aavartkaal kaa maan sameekaran se praapt maan se lagbhag 1% adhik hoga
 The periodic value for any dimension of the pendulum is given by the following infinite series- sharir ke madhya bhaag main qamar ke neeche guda ke aasapaas kaa gol ubhara hua bhaag nitamb kehalaata he

 So dhtml's dynamic balance is the way in which it works when a page is viewed and does not have the ability to generate a unique page as each page loads
