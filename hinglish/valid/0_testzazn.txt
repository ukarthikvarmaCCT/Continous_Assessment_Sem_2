 This community was founded in the 12th century by Mahatma Basavanam
 is mat ke upaask lingayat kehalaate hai
 The word is derived from the Kannada word lingwant
 ye log mukhyatah mahatma basavanna kii shikshaaon ke anugami hai
 The literal meaning of 'veerashaiva' is - 'one who is a supreme devotee of Shiva'
 kintu samay bitne ke saath virshaiv kaa tatvagyan darshan, sadhana, karmkand, saamaajik sanghatan, acharnium aadi anya sampradaayon se bhinn hote gaye
 Although Veerashaiva is also found in other parts of the country - Maharashtra, Andhra, Tamil region, etc
, Karnataka has the largest number of them
 shaiva log apane dharmik vishwaason or darshan kaa udgam vedon tathaa 28 shaivagamon se maanate hai
 Veerashaiva also does not show disbelief in the Vedas but in his philosophy, rituals and social reforms, such specialties have developed which are mainly derived from Shaivagams and such insight yogis who are known as 'vaadikars'
 12veen se 16 veen shatee ke bich lagbhag teen shatabdiyon main koi 300 vachanakaar hue hai jinamein se 30 striyaan rahi hai
 The most famous of these is Basava, who was the Prime Minister of the Jain king of Kalyan, Vizjal
 vah yogi mahatma hi na tha balki karmath sanghatankarta bhi tha jisane virshaiv sampradaay kii sthapana kii
 The goal of Vasava was to create a spiritual society in which caste, religion or women were not discriminated against
 vah karmkand sambandhi aadambar kaa virdohi tha or maansik pavitrataa evam bhakthi kii sachaai par bal detaa tha
 He was a supporter of the worship of only one God and tried to simplify the method of worship and meditation
 jati bhed kii samaapti tathaa striyon ke utthan ke kaaran samaaj main adbhut kranti utpann ho gai
 Jnana Yoga Bhakti Yoga and Karmayoga - All the three pledges are valid, but the most emphasis is on devotion

 Veerashaiva is sometimes called 'sharan' or Shiva Sharan of Mahatmas, ie people who have given themselves to Shiva's refuge
 unki sadhana shivayog kehalaati he
 Veerashaivism is basically monotheistic philosophy but is essentially beyond divine action and meditation and the existence of the world in our real experience cannot be explained without desire and action, hence Shiva's theory of power was conceived
 ishwar se ekta sthapit karne ke liye aadhyatmik aakankshi apni ek yaa teenon shaktiyon kaa prayog karata he
 The name of the use of love power is bhakti yoga, the knowledge of the use of thinking power and the name of the use of karma power is karma yoga
 inhen ke jariye parameshwar ke saath antim rup se ekta sthapit hoti he
 There is no doubt that the Veerashaivas also have temples, shrines, etc
 as in other sects, the difference being only between the deities who are worshiped
 jahaan tak virashaivon kaa sabandh he, devalayon yaa sadhana ke anya prakaaron kaa utana mahatv nahin he jitna isht ling kaa jisaki pratimaa sharir par dhaaran kii jaati he
 The spiritual master offers a favored penis to each Veerashaiva and bursts the sacred conspirator mantra 'om Nam Nam Shivaay' in his ear
 prayek virshaiv snanadi kar haath kii gadeli par isht ling kii pratimaa rakhkar chintan or dhyaan dwaara aradhana karata he
 Needless to say that every Veerashaiva is expected to possess high moral qualities like truthfulness, non-violence, fraternity
 vah niraamish bhoji hota he or sharaab aadi maadak vastuon se parhez karata he
 The summary of the directions issued by Basava in this regard is this - Do not steal, do not kill nor lie, do not praise or condemn others, treat all women other than your wife as mother

 Actor-network theory) is that method of social theory and research that considers things as part of social networks
 network kii avadharana ke ird-gird hua chintan abhi tak praudyogikeey or saamaajik chintan ke bich sambandh-sutara kaayam karne kii samasya kaa santoshjanak hal nahin khoj paaya he
 Actor- Network Theory tries this solution
 vigyaan or praudyogiki sambandhi adhyayan ke vidwaan bruno latur or mishael calen ne samajashastri jon lock kii madad se iskaa pratipaadan kiya
 Technically it is called the 'material-semitic' method
 arthath is siddhant ke dwaara vastuon ke bich sambandhon kaa adhyayan to kiya hi jaataa he, yah avadharanaon ke bich sambandhon kii samaj banane main bhi madad karata he
 This theory assumes that many relationships are simultaneously physical and suggestive
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi bank main vyaktiyon, unke vichaaron or praudyogiki ke bich trikoniya anyonyakriya hoti he
 As a result, a network is formed that 'acts' as a single entity, forming its own formula with different elements to be consistent and complete in itself
 actor-network ke is ke lagaataar banate-bigadate rahete hai
 In such networks, relationships have to be continuously and repeatedly 'performed', otherwise the network is shattered
 is network ko susangat banaaye rakhane ke liye jaruri he ki uske sadasyon ke bich dwandv kam se kam ho 
 Inspired by the ideas of French philosopher Zeal Dalz and Felix Guattari, this theory is interested in explaining how an actor-network is formed, how it sustains itself, and how it disintegrates
 lekin iske zariye yah pataa nahin chalata ki network apana prakat rup kaise grahan karata he
 Despite the duality of the concept of network, this theory has left scope for new thinking on mobility and connectivity questions
 jon lock or jon haverd dwaara sampadit granth "actor network thiyari and ocrator" main is siddhant kii visheshtaon, uplabdhiyon or simaaon kaa ek kargar kaakaa miltaa he
 According to Locke, this theory emphasizes the 'semiotics of materiality' or 'relational materiality'
 iskaa taatpary yah hua ki yah siddhant lakshanshastra ke daayre se lee gayi sanketon kii sambandhaatmakataa ke aujaar se bhautik roopon kaa vishleshan karata he
 These physical forms can also contain things related to daily life
 actor-network thiyari apni isi visheshta ke kaaran soshal network vishleshan se alag ho jaati he
 Symptomology is a philological tool, but this theory uses its insights to explore the relativity of the elements, and then through it is able to feel free to analyze all kinds of material
 nariwadi chintak donna haraave ne bhi nabbe ke dashak main bhautik or sankethik ke bich sambandhon kii thaah lene ke liye aise tattvon kaa adhyayan kiya tha jo bhautik rup main hone ke baavjood naye tarah kii bauddhik smapda kii taraf ishaara karti thim
 According to Locke, through this method, it finds out what effect the human non-human elements have with other elements
 ek-duusare ke saath sambandhon ke ke tahat chijen apni yaa dusron kii kriyaatmakataa se guzarati hai
 Here Locke asks what is the relationship between this functionality and the relative stability and spatiality of relations? In response, Locke introduces the idea of networks as an alternative place-scientist
 yani ek network ke tahat apni aapasi sutron yaa sambandhon ke aadhaar par vibhinn tatva apane sthanik akhandta kaayam rakh pate hai
 This is not the network that the master of social network analysis discusses
 unke liye to network ek apekshaakrit tatasth or varnanaatmak pad he
 For John Locke, the network itself is a form of spatiality or a set of forms
 network kii yah visheshta kisi bhi tarah kii topoljical sambhaavna par apni taraf se kadi seemayen aropit karti he
 She does not allow symmetry of the sources working within the network
 na hi sambhav sambandhon kaa samaroopikaran ho paata he
 As a result, the character of possible elements is also not harmonized
 isi par thiyari seemayen saamne aati hai
 The first difficulty that Locke finds with the concept of a network is that it can only be analyzed to a certain extent
 isaki vajah yah he ki network pehle se hi ek khaas rup grahan kar chukaa he
 a form that treats all the elements of its reach equally
 lock ko aapatti is baat par he ki is ravaiye ke kaaran network ke bheetar or networkon ke bich banane vaale sutron ke bare main puri jaankaree nahin milti
 For this reason, it is not possible to know about the elements how they achieved their present form
 lock kii manyata he ki jab tak yah thiyari network ke vichaar ke pare ja kar tattvon kii naanavidh bahulata par bal nahin degi, or sambandhon kii jatilta ko phir se rekhaankit nahin karegi tab tak yah samasya hal nahin ho sakati
 Interestingly, Bruno, the head of actor-network theory, later criticized it
 latur kaa kahana tha ki is siddhant main chaar chije kargar nahin hai
 Neither the word actor is effective, nor the network, nor the theory, nor the hyphen between the actor and the network
 unka tark yah tha ki bees saal pehle network ke vichaar or roopak kaa istemaal karne par vah samaaj or raashtra-rajya jaise sthapit vichaaron ke pare jane kii gunjaaish pradaan karata tha, par aaj world wide web kaa vajood kaayam ho chukaa he or lagbhag har vyakti network kaa motaa-motaa matlab samajhataa he
 In fact, Latur's intention behind rejecting his own theory was to say that in today's world the idea of networks is used only to emphasize the flexibility and fluxes that derive from the analysis of institutional forms
 is chakkar main hota yah he ki sthaniktaa kaa prashn vishleshan se chhot jaataa he or sansthagat rup aalochana se batch hai un aalochana koi asar nahin hota
 Secondly, while criticizing Latur, it was also worrying that the term network has started to be used indiscriminately in sociology today, while it is primarily a technical shay that should not be overlooked by the growth and complexity
 aalochana ke is mukaam par latur ko dalaz or guatari dwaara sujhaaye gayi rijmo ke vichaar main gunjaaish nazar aati he
 The peculiarity of Rijmo is that it expresses systemic properties without any well-defined geo-regionality due to its branching relationships
 dalaz or guatari kehete hai ki rijmo kii paribhaasha sambandh-sutron or vishmaangta ke aadhaar par hoti he
 He can establish a relationship with anyone at any time
 rijmo ke tarz par latur kehete hai ki network ko ek aise rup kii tarah grahan kiya janaa chahie jo lagaataar banataa-bigadataa rahata he, or jo sambandh-sutron kii abhootpurv sambhaavna pesh karata he
 While criticizing, Latur came to the conclusion that instead of saying network, the expression 'work-net' should be used now
 unke anusaar network main sabase mahatvapurn hissaa ‘work’ kaa hi he
 To-do, or performativity is required

 Despite the high positive results in its reader survey, Kishimoto thought "this art is bad and the story is messed up!" | Kishimoto was originally working on the Karakuri of Hop Step Award when dissatisfied with a draft he thought of working on something different that would later become the Naruto Manga series
 Kishimoto expresses concern that the use of the wheel and hand gestures make Naruto very Japanese, but he still believes it to be a pleasant text

 Kishimoto wanted to "portray" the Chinese zodiac tradition that has had a long-standing presence in Japan
 The sign of zodiac hand is generated from it
 When Kishimoto was creating Naruto manga adjustments, he was initially focused on the design of the village of Konohagakure, which was the primary focus of the series
 Kishimoto claims that his Konohagakure's design was "effortless without much thought" but believes that the scenery is based on his home in Okayama, Japan
 Without a specific time period, Kishimoto added new elements to the series
 Such as convenience stores but did not include knowledgeable projectile weapons and vehicles
 For reference material, Kishimoto himself did research in Japanese culture and mentioned it in his work
 Regarding technology, Kishimoto said that there will be no firearm in Naruto
 He said that he might include automotive, aircraft and "under-processing" computers
 Kishimoto said the computer would "probably" be eight bits and would not be "definitely" sixteen bits
 He has also said that he has an idea of the story and text of the last chapter of the series
 However, he says that it may take a long time to finish the series because "there is still a need to solve many things"

 It is also called gas immersion tube
 isamen kisi kuchaalak taap-rodhi paatr ke andar koi samuchit gas bhari hoti he or uske bheetar electrodon kaa samuchit vinyas kiya gaya hota he
 Often the vessels are made of glass, but the characters of some tubes are also made of ceramic

 The electrical properties of gas tubes depend to a large extent on the nature and pressure of the gases filled in these tubes
 in naliyon main thodi si gas daal di jaati he
 Most of the gases that are used are mercury vapor, organ, neon etc
 gasanalee main ye 1 se 30*10-3 millimetre dabaav par rahati hai
 As the voltage of the cation is increased from zero, the filler current starts to increase in these tubes like vacuum tubes
 tathaapi jab voltata gas ke ynikaran vibhav par pahunch jaati he, to muthbhed ke dwaara ynikaran ho jaataa he
 The filtered current reaches its full value and then there is no effect on increasing the fillet voltages more
 is parinaam ko chitra 9 main dikhya gaya he
 This is because the positive ions produced by the encounter completely remove the effect of the transfer charge, only when its control over the electron current ceases and the full electron current begins to flow

 is niyantrak grid kaa kaary bhi lagbhag nirvaat nalee ke gridniyantran sa hi he, parantu ek bahut badi vibhinnata donon ke niyantran main he
 If the potential of this grid is gradually increased from a negative value, it will be seen that as soon as its value reaches the point at which the current starts flowing, the current starts flowing from its lowest value to its absolute value
 
 jaise hi purna dhara pravaahit hone lagati he, niyatrank grid par dhara kaa kisi prakaar kaa prabhaav nahin rah jaataa
 After that no matter how much negative voltage is added to the grid, the flow of filler current cannot stop
 keval pattic voltata ko ynikaran vibhav ke kam karke pattic dhara ke pravaahan ko roka ja saktaa he
 The reason for this is that as the current flows, the ion ions are negative, covering the grid, and the grid potential has no effect in fluency
 is prakaar kii naliyon kaa upyog yojana tathaa 'trigar' ke roopon main kiya jaataa he jiskaa bahut hi mahatvapurn upyog aajkal ke electrunic upkarnon main kiya ja rahaa he

 janajati vah saamaajik samudaay he jo rajya ke vikaas ke purv astitv main tha yaa jo ab bhi rajya ke baahar hai
 The tribe is actually a statutory term used for the tribals of India
 bharat ke samvidhan main anusuchit janajati pad kaa prayog hua he or inke liye vishesh praavdhaan lagu kiye gaye hai
 There has been a lack of clear and settled ideas about the tribal population in India
 'kabila' shabd kii paribhaasha ke vishay main bhi vidwaanon main mataiky nahin he
 Consequently, even in the census reports, where some tribes have been placed in the list of castes, many lower castes have also been included in the tribes
 is sambandh main ek janaganana se duusari janaganana main bhi vishmata pai jaati he
 According to a census, the religion of all Indian tribes falls under the category of 'spiritism', but in its next census itself, the tribal religion has been made a completely separate category
 vastav main mul prashn yah he ki 'kabila' kehete kise hai? is shabd kii ab tak di gai paribhaashaon se adhik nyaaysangat sambhavat: nutan kintu gunatmak paribhaasha he
 According to this new definition, the tribe is such an endogamous social group residing within a certain geographical range in which specialization of functions is not found
 samaan bhashaa yaa boli dwaara sangathit or kabeel adhikariyon dwaara prashasit yah samooh anya kabeelon or jatiyon se saamaajik duuri maanata he kintu jativyavastha kii bhanti saamaajik dwesh jaisi bhaavana se achoota he
 The clan has its own traditions, beliefs and customs and a sense of homogeneity arising from ethnic and Bhagolik assemblages gives rise to immunity from external influences in the members of the clan
 kabila anusuchit ho saktaa he or nahin bhi
 The process of culture-holding in the clan is either complete or partially completed

 Indian tribes can be divided into three categories on the basis of caste
 pratham shrenee main mongoleey mul ke naga, kuki, gaaro tathaa asmi kabeeley yaa almoda jile ke bhotiya aadi kabeeley aate hai
 In the second category, Munda, Santhal, Korwa, etc
, the pura-australian clan, and in the third category, the lower Himalayan Khas clan of pure Aryan origin or hindus-aryan-blood clan but mixed type of Bhil tribes can be placed
 bhashashastreey drushti se bhartiya kabeelon kaa vargeekaran teen pruthak bhashapariwaar ke samoohon main kiya ja saktaa he
 These groups belong to Munda, tibeto-burmese and Dravidian languages, respectively

 Some shaved clan fall into this category
 mul rup se munda bhashapariwaar kii boli bolanewaale gujarat ke bheelon ne bhi apane adhivasaanusaar gujarati yaa marathi apana lee he
 Apart from these tribes within certain geographical boundaries, there are nomadic tribes like Nuts, Bhatu, Sansi, Karwal and Kanjar etc
 which till recently were criminals but who have been freed from strict controls and tough rules
 sabhi shreniyon ke in kabeelon kii kul jansankhya lagbhag teen karod he kintu anek kabeelon ke jatinaam or jatigat vyavsaay apana liye hai
 That is why the recent census has put their number at around two crore
 punarvaas kii samasya ko dhyaan main rakhte hue saanskrithik padaanusaar kabeelon ko teen shreniyon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he : Culturally, the tribes far away from the rural and urban groups, ie those who are often unconnected, nagarsamskruti se prabhavit ve kabeeley jinamein samparkon ke falswaroop samasyaon kaa bijaropan hua he or The tribes that came in contact with the villagers and the municipal groups, in which such problems either did not arise, or because of the successful cultural culture, are no longer there
 saanskrithik samparkon ke prasang main bhartiya kabeelon ko anukulak or satmikaarak, in do shreniyon main baanta ja saktaa he
 Adaptive clan can be of three types — cohort, homologous and par-culture-bearers
 sahabhojita kaa arth padosi samoohon ke saath samaan aarthik kaaryon main bhaag lenaa he
 The term composite is used to mean the economic and cultural self-reliance of tribes

 This classification did not count those tribes that had been left untouched by contact with external cultures
 kintu vaastaviktaa yah he ki bharat main saanskrithik samparkon kaa 'shunya bindu' he hi nahin
 In other words, all the tribes have come into contact with more advanced cultures than their own and are consequently either problematic or leading a relatively satisfactory life by adjusting from contact status
 adhikansh bhartiya kabeelon kaa nivas wanon main he or ve vanya prakritik sadhano par hi nirbhar karte hai
 The Kadars of Cochin, the Malayantharam of Travancore, the Paliyans of Madras and the Panyans of Wayanad are such clans
 kuch kabeelon kii arthvyavastha khaadya padaarthon kii sanchayan or pichhadi krishi ke bich kii he
 Prominent among these tribes are Kamar of Madhya Pradesh and Vaiga of Mandla region in this state and Reddy of Bisan hills in the south
 uparyukt donon shreniyon ke kabeelon par shashan kii van sambandhi nitiyon kaa gaharaa prabhaav padataa he
 Most of the country's tribal population can be placed in the third economic category of Indian tribes

 Almost all the tribes of north-eastern and Central India fall in this category

 In contrast, the policy of the present regime is of active intervention

 But it is necessary to understand that the level of tribes varies from region to region and full knowledge of local conditions is required before efficient policy making
 vigat bhoolen bhavishya kii pathpradarshak hoti hai
 Till now, the government has not given a clear explanation of the philosophical basis of the huge work such as tribal rehabilitation and this is not possible until proper information about the Indian tribes is received
 kabeeli kaaryakramon ke paramparaagat sanskrit ke sangrakshan or sucharu evam sangathit rup se parivartanon ke bijaropan par samaan rup se bal diya ja rahata he
 The new social consciousness and the aspirations of the governmental efforts to benefit the tribal people are two new directions in the context of Indian tribal problems
 kabeelon ko unki vartmaan pichhadi dasha se ubarkar unhen graamy samskritiyon ke anuroop banane kaa kaary atyant satarkatapurvak sampann kiya janaa chahie
 If a plan of progress is made in this way, then there will be only two forms of living in the future Indian culture - rural and civic, and social scientists will be responsible to bridge the gap between these two forms by firm bridges

 But when the Pahadia people raised the slogan of rebellion against the Hindu landlords, the British government sent its army for peace
 vidrohi netaaon ko sandein dekar pratihinsa kii jwaala shant kii gai
 Retired and disabled soldiers were encouraged to settle around the Pahadia region in the interest of peacekeeping
 kalantar se vyavhaar or dandvidhiyaan bhi kabeeli netaaon ke adhikaar kshetra main aa gayi
 Justice and discipline were improved and the regime deemed the clan worthy of special treatment

 In the year 1796, the hill area was renamed damani-ko and a new law was approved for its administration
 yah sampurna kshetra ek samaharta ke prashasanadhikaar main aa jiske shashan main bharat ke anya bhaagon main prachlit vidhi se koi sambandh nahin tha
 At the same time, there was a fire of discontent in Chota Nagpur and Santhal Parganas

 The famous Santhal Rebellion erupted in 1886
 santhal pargana ko ek pruthak jila bana diya or san 1855 ke 38wein vinimay ke anusaar vinium ke anusaar yah 'aviniyamit' kshetra ghoshit kar diya gaya

 By the Government of India Act of 1870, the Council of Governors was empowered to make rules for areas where the prevailing behavior and penal procedure in other parts of British India were limited

 Local government was empowered to clarify laws which were not applicable in these areas like other parts of British India
 yadi aavashyaktaa padane par sanshodhit athwa simit rup main british bharat ke anya bhaagon main prachlit koi kanoon in kshetron main lagu kiya to uski adhisuchana centre ko dena anivaary tha
 But even this specific governance did not solve the clan difficulties

 According to this section, the backward regions were divided into two parts - san 1935 ke rakshaatmak upayon dwaara kabeeli jansankhya main sudhaar kii cheshtaa kii gai
 In the new Indian constitution, more emphasis has been laid on the protective responsibility of the husband rule of tribes

 In these areas, proper arrangements are being made for education, community development, social welfare and family hygiene etc
 kabeelon ke prati vishesh vyavhaar kii niti ke atirikt shashan ne rajkeey sevaaon main bhi kabiliyon ke liye kuch sthaan surakshit kar die hai
 For this work, a department of scheduled tribes and castes has been formed, headed by a commissioner

 It is not possible to say so much about the failure of these efforts of tribal rehabilitation

 There are many provisions related to Scheduled Tribes in India

 china-pakistan aarthik galiyara yaa urdu main pakistan-china iqatisaadi raahdaari ek bahut badi vanijyik pariyojna he, jiskaa uddeshy dakshin-pashchimi pakistan se china ke uttar-pashchimi swytt kshetra shinjiyang tak guadar bandargah, railway or hive ke madhyam se tel or gas kii kam samay main vitaran karnaa he
 The Economic Corridor holds central importance in sino-pak relations, the corridor is approximately 2442 kilometers long from Gwadar to Kashgar
 yah yojana ko sampoorn hone main kaaphi samay lagegaa
 The plan is estimated to cost $ 46 billion
 yah galiyara pakistan adhikrut kashmir, gilgit-baltistan or baluchistan hote hue jaayegaa
 According to various reports, Gwadar Port is being developed in such a way that it will be able to send 19 million tonnes of crude oil directly to China
 yadhyapi is pariyojna kii pariklpana 1950 ke dashak main hi kii gayi thi, lekin varshon tak pakistan main raajnneetik asthirataa rahane ke kaaran is lakshya ko praapt nahin kiya ja sakaa
 China started construction work at Pakistan's Gwadar port in 1998, which was completed in 2002
 china kii shi jinping kii sarkaar ne saal 2014 main china-pakistan aarthik galiyare kii aadhikarik rup se ghoshnaa kii
 Through this, China announced about $ 46 billion for various development works in Pakistan
 18 disambar 2017 ko china or pakistan nen milakar is aarthik galiyare kii lambi avadhi kii yojana ko manjuuri de di
 Under this scheme, China and Pakistan will remain economic partners till 2030
 iske saath hi pakistan ne is yojana main chini mudra yuan kaa istemaal karne kii bhi manjuuri de di he
 India has considered the construction of the corridor illegal according to international law as it passes through Pakistan occupied Kashmir, which India considers its part
 is maamle main bharat ne china ke raashtrapati shi jinping se bhi aapatti darj karai thi
 India has also expressed its opposition to the Russian government over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 mana ja rahaa he ki pakistan or china ke bich 46 billian dollar kii badi laagat se banane vaala yah galiyara dakshin asia ke bhu-raajnneetik paridrishy main bada badlaav laane vaala siddh hoga
 The purpose of this corridor is to establish connectivity between Kashgar in China's northwestern Xinjiang province, Gwadar port in Balochistan, Pakistan, through a 3000 km wide network of roads and other infrastructure projects
 dastavejon ke anusaar, ise 2030 tak puraa hona he, or yah donon deshon ke liye phydemand hoga
 Once this corridor is built, China will use the truncated roadway to import energy, as opposed to the current 12,000 km long route
 isse prati varsh china ke lakhon dollar kii bachat hogi
 Also, its access to the Indian Ocean will also become easier
 pakistan ko aashaa he ki isse uskaa infrastracchar viksit hoga or badale main uske jal, saura, ushma or pawan sanchalit urja sanyantron ke liye 34 billian dollar kii sambhavit prapti hogi, jisase uski gambhir urja sankat main kami aayegi yaa vah puri tarah se khatm ho jaayegi
 Iran, Russia and Saudi Arabia are also very excited about being part of CPEC in the future
 is sambhaavna ne is bahuprachaarit aarthik galiyare ke rahasy ko or badha diya he
 At the same time, this agreement is the less publicized side - under this deal China will also supply eight submarines to Pakistan, which will greatly increase Pakistan's naval power
 pakistan main china kii ruchi keval aarthik laabh tak hi simit nahin he
 The fully-operated Gwadar port will not only bring commercial benefits to China, but will also bring it strategic and geopolitical benefits on a large scale
 haalanki, vartmaan main guadar ko keval vyavsaayik hiton ke liye viksit kiya ja rahaa he, lekin is baat kii puri sambhaavna he ki bhavishya main ise ek purna susajjit nausainik adde ke taur par viksit kiya jaye
 In such a situation, China can get a large-scale strategic advantage in the region
 jaisaa ki sarvavidit he, pakistan in dinon charampanth, aatankwaad or bhrashtachar ke sabase bure daur se guzar rahaa he, aise main uskaa iraadaa is pariyojna se na keval aarthik laabh lenaa hoga, balki china kii saraparasti main apni vaishvik chhavi ko sudhaarna bhi hoga
 However, Pakistan will also have to balance its potential negative effects with the anticipated benefits from CPEC
 yadhyapi is galiyare se pakistan ko ek vrahat aarthik laabh milegaa, parantu isaki kshamta or aarthik auchity ko lekar kai shankaaen bhi hai
 At the same time, Pakistan is facing a lot of internal and external political challenges these days, which can be a hindrance in the development of the corridor
 galiyare ke nirmaan kaaryon kii vajah se pakistan main karyrat chini shramikon, adhikariyon or ejiniyaron kii suraksha main yahaan hajaaron kii sankhya main chini surakshakarmi tainaat hai or itani badi baat ko pakistan ne nazarandaaj kiya hua he, yah ascharyajanak he
 The presence of such a large number of foreign troops on Pakistani soil should be a matter of concern for the Pakistani establishment, especially given the new imperialist thinking of China and the efforts being made in Afghanistan to realize it
 vikaas kii aad main is pariyojna ko lekar china jis tarah se pakistan ke prakritik sansaadhaanon, khaskar baluchistan kaa istemaal kar rahaa he, usase yahaan ke kai log chintit hai
 Chinese companies have leased thousands of acres of land in Pakistan to grow crops
 saath hi chini companiyon ko ise niryaat karne ke liye pakistan ko sthaneey kar bhi nahin chukaana padega
 In such a situation, the Government of Pakistan is giving many such resources to China, from which it may face problems later
 is galiyare ke safal hone kii kunjee baluchistan sthit guadar bandargah ke paas he or pakistan kii aakanksha is kshetra kaa aarthik mukhiya banane kii he
 However, the voice over the issue of making Balochistan a separate nation and the controversy arising out of the army's stance due to it, is also presenting many challenges for this corridor
 baluchistan ke naagarik sipiisi kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 If this corridor is successfully constructed, then it is expected that many people from other province of Pakistan will leave their province and settle in Balochistan
 isi kaaran vibhinn sipiisi pariyojna ke liye kaam kar rahe chini ejiniyaron or adhikariyon par balooch vidrohi samoohon dwaara anek hamale ho chuke hai
 At the same time, many banned organizations are threatening this project, although their aim is to equalize their account with Pakistan under this guise
 iske saath hi khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa or sindh jaise praant ke anek raajnneetik sanghathan bhi is galiyare kii vaastavik ruparekha ko badalane ko lekar apni jinta jataa chuke hai
 They believe that this corridor has been deliberately changed to provide economic benefits to Punjab province
 haal main jab ek pakistani rajaneta ne sansad main chetavanee di ki china-pakistan aarthik galiyara ke rup main ek east india company aakaar le rahi he
 This was stated by Senator Tahir Mashhadi, chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Planning and Development, and his main concern was the huge debt owed by Pakistan to China for this corridor
 mashhadi ne chini hiton ke anuroop bijli kii daren nirdhaarit karne kii maang par aitraaj jataayaa tha
 Apart from this, the lack of transparency regarding terms and financial statement is also the biggest cause for concern
 state bank of pakistan ke governor ne bhi kaha he ki unhen nahin pataa he ki 46 billian dollar main se kitna karj he, kitni equity he or kitna saamaan ke rup main aana he
 They have demanded greater transparency
 isi tarah se antarrashtriya mudra kosh ne bhi aarthik galiyare ke sambhavit nakaaratmak parinaamon ko lekar aagaah kiya he
 As this corridor will pass through Pakistan, the infrastructure of all the provinces through this corridor will get a chance to improve
 is mahatvakankshi pariyojna kii ruparekha ke anusaar, iske nirmit hone se nayi sadakon, rajmargon, railway, hawaii addon or bandargahon kaa nirmaan bhi hoga or ve viksit bhi honge
 It is also expected that this will give provinces like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan far behind Punjab in terms of development
 itnaa hi nahin, jab yah pariyojna purna rup se viksit ho jaayegi, to isse bade paimaane par rojgaar bhi srujit hoga
 It is also expected that with this proposed investment of China, Pakistan's gross domestic product will increase by 15 percent to reach $ 274 billion
 pakistan kii sust padi arthvyavastha kaa yahaan ke sthaneey urja sankat se sidhaa sambandh he
 Pakistan has failed miserably to meet its energy needs

 As part of a specific plan, 10 projects of 6,600 MW will be developed in the Thar Desert, which will transform this very remote area into the energy capital of Pakistan

 Constitutionalism refers to the form of government in which the constitution plays a major role
 adhikariyon ko manamaane nirnay kii chhot hone ke sthaan par 'kanoon ke rajya' kaa paksh lenaa hi samvidhanwaad he
 The basic feeling of constitutionalism is that government officials are not free to do anything, and in any manner, but they have the freedom to work within the limits of their power and that too according to the procedure described in the constitution
 aitihaasik prakriya ke parinaam swaroop hi samvidhanik rajyon kaa janm hua
 Constitutionalism was born as a result of man's attempt to avoid tyranny and misuse of the state power
 aadhunik samvidhanwaad ke vistrut aadhaar hai, kintu iskaa mul aadhaar ‘‘vidhi kaa shashan’’ hi mana jaataa he
 Since ancient times, thinking has been done on such diverse ideas that can effectively control the state and become helpful in its good use

 Constitutionalism is the product of British colonialism
 angrezon ne iske zariye ek tir se teen nishane lagane kii koshish kii
 Their first objective was that through constitutionalism, their colonies would gradually grow towards self-governance and the process of de-colonization could be slowed down
 unka doosraa uddeshy yah sunishchit karnaa tha ki swa-shashan hasil kar lene ke baad bhi yani swatantra ho jane ke baavjood upniveshit rajya unke prabhaav ke daayre main rahen
 The constitutionalist path of self-governance was designed in this way
 samvidhanwaad se angrezon ne ek teesraa or pechida makasad hasil karne kii koshish bhi kii
 They wanted to reconcile the urges of their liberalism, parliamentary democracy, free market and individual freedom with the military, social and economic reality of colonialism
 darasal, europe kii upniveshvaadi takaton kaa samrajyavaadee darshan ek sa nahin tha
 As a result, they adopted different approaches to the process of colonization and de-colonization
 dilachasp baat yah he ki british upniveshvaadi bhi samakaleen europee upniveshvaadiyon se kam naslvaadi or damankaaree nahin the
 However, he adopted a policy of gradual transfer of power and indirect rule in his other colonies except Ireland
 maharani victoria kaa shashan packs britanika kii niti par chalata tha jiske mutabik british hukumat sthaneey reeti-rivaazon or raajnneeti main hastkshep karne se aam taur par parhez karti thi
 His emphasis was on trade, foreign policy and defense under his control
 isi ke mutabik unhone governor dwaara niyantrit kiye jane vaale upniveshon main bhi use salaah dene ke liye adhikariyon kii ek kaaryakari parishad niyukt kar rakhi thi
 Later, he also got the Legislative Council elected so that the laws made would appear to be made by his representatives to the colonized people
 angrezon ke mukaable francoisiyon kaa jor apane upniveshon ke francisi raashtra main sampoorn aatmsatikaran par rahata tha
 British politician Edmund Burke said that if the laws were made according to the genius, nature and mind of the indigenous people, then colonial rule would prove to be most effective
 isi siddhant ke mutabik ek ke baad ek british sarkaron ne upniveshon main bad rahe raajnneetik asantosh kaa daman to kiya hi, par saath hi raajnneetik or sanvaidhanik sudhaaron kii prakriya bhi chalaai
 Behind this policy was the experience of the nineteenth century which the British colonialists had acquired from the established colonies in America, New Zealand and Australia
 in upniveshon main raajnneetik pratinidhitiv ke kuch aise rup viksit kiye gayi the jinke tahat vahaan ke adhivaasiyon ko lagata tha ki unhen england kii naagarikta bhi praapt he
 Based on this, the British made a policy that nationalist movements should be encouraged to go towards self-governance by doing constitutional politics
 vahaan kii janata ko dhire-dhire vidhaayi adhikaar diye jaaen
 First they should take the responsibility of internal governance and then control of foreign policy should also be handed over to them
 angrez lagaataar is shabdaadambar kaa prayog karte rahe ki apane aupniveshik mishan ke zariye ve asia or africa ke ‘pichde’ samaajon ko sansadeey loktantr or uttaradaayi shashan kii vivekpurna british paramparaon se sampann karnaa chaahate hai
 Indeed, colonies were becoming increasingly difficult to hold
 isliye britain ne lacheela or parinamvaadi ravaiya akhriyaar karte hue apni satta or prabhaav ko surakshit karne ke liye sanvaidhanik sudhaaron kaa rasta apanaaya
 The policy of constitutionalism was based on the belief that the policy of military repression and forced occupation to maintain an empire is no longer effective
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad to yah hakeekat or bhi saafe ho gayi
 British policymakers became convinced that the move to de-colonization could only be controlled through constitutional reforms
 keval isi tarah se british sarkaar naye banane vaale swatantra or samprabhu rashtron ke saath ghanishtha aarthik, raajnneetik or ranneetik rishte banaaye rakh saktaa tha
 The colonialists tried to bring the colonized people under centralized and unified administration so that their economic exploitation could be maximized
 isaki pratikriya main rashtrawaad aarthik tark le kar takaraav kii mudra main saamne aata tha
 The British cleverly selected liberal and soft elements from among the nationalists and made local policies in such a way that the same elements could be dominated by the national movement
 ugr rashtravaadiyon kaa daman karne or naram rashtravaadiyon ko protsaahit karne ke saath-saath unki duusari niti saamaajik rup se paramparanishth or anudaar abhijanon ke saath gathjod kar lene kii hoti thi
 It is believed that his most successful use of this constitutionalism was in Ceylon
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan apane is upnivesh ke samrik mahatva dekh kar angrez srilanka ko dominian yaa swatantra upnivesh kaa darja dene ke liye taiyaar ho gayi
 In return, he ensured cooperation with Ceylon in matters of defense and foreign policy
 srilankai samaaj sinhalai bahusankhya or tamil or musalmaan alpsankhya main banta hua tha
 The British established alliances with the socially conservative Sinhalese lords
 isi tarah malaya ko 1957 main azaadi dene ke badale angrezon ne rashtramandaleey vyapaar or pratiraksha pranali main malay bhagidaari ko sunishchit kiya
 It was only after 1945 that the British formed a centralized administration by tying up with the conservative traditional rulers of Malaya
 isi ke tahat 1954 main chunaav karaaye gayi or angrezon ke man kii party jeet gayi
 The British transferred power to him
 samvidhanwaad kii yah niti har jagah angrezon kii marji ke mutabik nahin chali
 He also undertook a long process of constitutional reforms in India, but his intentions were thwarted by the anti-british campaign led by the Congress during and after World War II
 congress or muslim lig ke bich karaab hote sambandhon ne bhi angrezon kii daal nahin galane di
 However, the reality cannot be denied that the British have always adopted the attitude of moderates to prevent the nationalist movement from going into the hands of the extremists
 kuch prekshak rashtriya andolan ke kuch netaaon kii chamakdaar chhavi banane ke peeche british shashan ke iraade or yojana ko bhi dekhte hai
 Similarly, the constitutionalism of the British in the West African colony Gold Coast did not yield the desired results
 1950 ke naye samvidhan ke tahat nakruma kii party ne kramshah ke bajaay tezi se sanvaidhanik sudhaar karne ke liye majaboor kar diya
 Nkruma's party won a landslide victory in the elections held after the universal suffrage was declared and the British lost their intended political forces
 upniveshvaadiyon ko majabuuran nakruma ko sattarudh hone ke liye jail se reeha karnaa padaa
 In 1957 the Gold Coast turned into the Republic of Ghana
 kuch aise upnivesh bhi the jahaan angrezon ne samvidhanwaad kii niti nahin apanaayi or daman kaa ravaiya jari rakhaa
 The example of Kenya shows that in the circumstances there, the British rejected the powers of the emerging African nationalism as fierce and unrestrained
 unki koshish thi ki ek bahunasli samvidhan paarit karvaa liya jaae taaki shwet alpsankhyakon kaa rang-rutaba kaayam rakhaa ja sake
 He turned down the demands of Kikayu, Kenya's largest clan
 sanvaidhanik riyaayaten na dene ke kaaran angrezon ne rashtravaadiyon ke bich ugrapanthiyon ke liye rasta saafe kar diya
