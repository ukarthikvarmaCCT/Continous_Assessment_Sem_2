tatpashchaat maharaj shantanu ne chhattis varsh brahmacharya vrath dhaaran kar ke vyateet kar diye
 Then one day he went to the Ganges and said to Ganga, "ganges! Today i want to see the child whom you took with you
 " ganga ek sundar stri ke rup main us balak ke saath prakat ho gayi or boleen, "rajan! yah aapkaa putr he tathaa iskaa naam devvrat he, ise grahan karo
 Along with being mighty, he will also be a scholar
 astr vidya main yah parashuram ke samaan hoga
 "maharaj Shantanu was overjoyed to find his son Devavrata and brought him with him to Hastinapur and declared him crown prince
 ek din maharaj shantanu yamuna ke tat par gum rahe the ki unhen nadi main naav chalaate huye ek sundar kanya drushtigat hui
 Smell was coming out of his body
 maharaj ne us kanya se poocha, "he devi! tum koun ho?" kanya ne bataaya, "maharaj! meraa naam satyavati he or main nishad kanya hoon
 "maharaj, rearing her youth at her appearance, immediately reached her father and proposed his marriage to Satyavati
 is par dheenvar bolaa, "rajan! mujhe apni kanya kaa aapke saath vivaah karne main koi aapatti nahin he parantu aapako meri kanya ke garbh se utpann putr ko hi apane rajya kaa uttaradhikari bananaa hoga
 
 " nishad ke in vachanon ko sun kar maharaj shantanu chupchaap hastinapur laut aaye
 King Shantanu became distraught due to his separation with Satyavati
 unka sharir durbal hone laga
 Seeing this condition of Maharaj, Devavrata got very worried
 jab unhen mantriyon ke dwaara pita kii is prakaar kii dasha hone kaa kaaran gyaat hua to ve tatkaal samast mantriyon ke saath nishad ke ghar ja pahunche or unhone nishad se kaha, "he nishad! aap saharsha apni putree satyavati kaa vivaah mere pita shantanu ke saath kar den
 i promise you that the child born from your daughter's womb will be the heir to the kingdom
 kaalaantar main meri koi santaan aapaki putree ke santaan kaa adhikaar chin na paye is kaaran se main pratigya karata hoon ki main aajanm avivaahit rahoonga
 "hearing this promise, Nishad folded his hands and said," o Devvrat! Your pledge is unprecedented
 " itnaa kah kar nishad ne tatkaal apni putree satyavati ko devvrat tathaa unke mantriyon ke saath hastinapur bhej diya
 Devavrata brought his mother Satyavati and handed it over to her father Shantanu
 pita ne prasann hokar putr se kaha, "vatsa! tuune pitrubhakti ke vasheebhoot hokar aisi pratigya kii he jaisi ki na aaj tak kisi ne kiya he or na bhavishya main karegaa
 i give you a boon that you will die by your will
 teri is prakaar kii pratigya karne ke kaaran tu bhishma kahalaayegaa or teri pratigya bhishma pratigya ke naam se sadaiv prakhyat rahegi
 " satyavati ke chitrangad or vichitraveery naamak do putr huye
 Shantanu died in the childhood of Chitrangad and Vichitravirya, so Bhishma was nurtured
 bhishma ne chitrangad ke bade hone par unhen rajgaddi par bitha diya lekin kuch hi kaal main gandharvon se yuddh karte huye chitrangad maaraa gaya
 At this Bhishma handed over the kingdom to his Anuj Vichitravirya
 ab bhishma ko vichitraveery ke vivaah kii chintaa hui
 At the same time, the three girls of Kashiraj, Amba, Ambika and Ambalaika were about to be swayamvara
 unke swayamvar main jaakar akele hi bhishma ne vahaan aaye samast raajaaon ko parrast kar diya or teenon kanyaon kaa haran kar ke hastinapur le aaye
 The elder girl Amba told Bhishma that she had given her body and mind to Raj Shalva
 uski baat sun kar bhishma ne use raja shalve ke paas bhijwa diya or ambika or ambalika kaa vivaah vichitraveery ke saath karvaa diya
 King Shalva did not accept Amba, so she returned to Hastinapur and said to Bhishma, "O Arya! You have brought me everything, so you marry me
" " kintu bhishma ne apni pratigya ke kaaran uske anurodh ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Amba was angry and went to Parashurama and told him about his agony and asked for help
 parashuram ne amba se kaha, "he devi! aap chintaa na karen, main aapkaa vivaah bhishma ke saath karwaaungaa
 "parashurama sent a call to Bhishma but Bhishma did not go to him
 is par krodhit hokar parashuram bhishma ke paas pahunche or donon veeron main bhayanak yuddh chhid gaya
 Both were unprecedented warriors, so the victory and victory could not be decided
 aakhir devataaon ne hastkshep kar ke is yuddh ko band karvaa diya
 Disappointed, Amba went to do penance in the forest
 vichitraveery apni donon raniyon ke saath bhoga vilaas main rat ho gayi kintu donon hi raniyon se unki koi santaan nahin hui or ve kshay rog se peedit ho kar mrityu ko praapt ho gayi
 Now fearing total destruction, Mother Satyavati said to Bhishma one day, "son! To save this dynasty from being destroyed, my command is that you produce a son from these two queens
" " mata kii baat sun kar bhishma ne kaha, "mata! main apni pratigya kisi bhi sthiti main bhang nahin kar saktaa
 " yah sun kar mata satyavati ko atyant dukh hua
 Suddenly he remembered his son Ved Vyas
 samaran karte hi vedavyas vahaan upasthit ho gayi
 Satyavati looked at them and said, "O son, all your brothers have gone childless
 atah mere vansh ko naash hone se bachaane ke liye main tumhen ajna detii hoon ki tum unki patniyon se santaan utpann karo
 "ved Vyas obeyed and said," Mother! You should tell both those queens that they will follow the fast for one year only then they will conceive
 " ek varsh vyateet ho jane par vedavyas sabase pehle badi rani ambika ke paas gayi
 Ambika closed her eyes due to fear of his glory
 vedavyas laut kar mata se bole, "mata ambika kaa bada tejasvi putr hoga kintu netra band karne ke dosha ke kaaran vah andhaa hoga
 "satyavati was deeply saddened to hear this and sent Vedvyas to the younger queen Ambalika
 ambalika vedavyas ko dekh kar bhay se pili pad gai
 On returning from her chamber, Ved Vyas said to Satyavati, "mother! Ambalika will have a son suffering from Pandu disease from her womb
 " isse mata satyavati ko or bhi dukh hua or unhone badi rani ambalika ko punah vedavyas ke paas jane kaa aadesh diya
 This time the elder queen did not go herself and sent her handmaid to Ved Vyas
 is baar vedavyas ne mata satyavati ke paas aa kar kaha, "maate! is daasi ke garbh se veda-veydant main paarangat atyant nitivaan putr utpann hoga
 "saying this, Ved Vyas went to penance
 samay aane par ambika ke garbh se janmaandh dhritarashtra, ambalika ke garbh se pandu rog se grasit pandu tathaa daasi ke garbh se dharmatma vidura kaa janm hua

 computer vigyaan main ek software sarthak kramadeshon or zaruri soochnaaon kaa ek aisa tantra he jo computer ke yantransh or duusare softwaron ko aadesh dekar kramadeshak kaa manachaaha kaam karata he
 In practice, if a computer is defined, then we can call hardware as human body and software as its soul
 hardware computer ke hisson ko kehete hai, jinhen ham apni aankhon se dekh sakate hai, chhu sakate hai athwa aujaaron se unpar kaary kar sakate hai
 This is the real substance
 iske vipareet software koi padaarth nahin he
 These are the information, commands or methods on which the computer hardware works
 computer hardware software se parichit hote hai athwa software computer ke hardware se parichit evam unpar aadhaarit hote hai
 Earlier, there was only one computer system for a task and it was given programs at the mechanical level, which was economical to change
 takanic ke vikaas ke saath aise yantransh bananaa takneekee rup se sambhav or aarthik rup se laabhadaayak ho sakaa
 It was very difficult to program early computer systems because at that time the theory that software was also in the initial state of a set of information which was safe in the memory of a device
 tab 'panch card' naamak saadhaaran se yantransh par computer ke yantransh ko diye jane vaale kramadesh ke nirdesh sidhe likhe jate the
 All instructions were given to the computer software with the help of only two digits - '0' and '1'
 ise dwaidh nirdesh kehete he, dwaidh rup ke hi kramadeshon ko hi yantransh lagu kar saktaa he
 In technical terms, there are three types of software
 “system software” yah ek aisa program hota he, jinka kaam system arthath computer ko chalaanaa tathaa use kaam karne laayak banaae rakhana he
 System software adds life to the hardware
 oparating system, compiler aadi system sofyware ke mukhya bhaag hai
 'application software' is called programs that are written to perform core tasks based on our computer
 aavashyaktaanusaar bhinn-bhinn upyogon ke liye bhinn-bhinn software hote hai
 The programs written for the work of calculating salary, accounting of transactions, stock of goods, accounting of sales, etc
 are called application software

 Seven types of intellectual property rights are discussed in TRIPS
 Three types of rights, ie copyright, trade secret, and patents, affect computer software
 software ko patent karaane kaa mudda vivaadaaspad he tathaa kuch kathin bhi
 We have discussed it separately in patents and computer software
 object code computer ko chalaata he or yah sadaa prakashit hota he, parantu kya yah kisi chiz kaa varnan he athwa nahin is bare main shankaa thi
 Under the TRIPS agreement, it was said that computer programs should be protected like copyright
 isaliye object code hamaare desh main tathaa sansar ke anya deshon main isi prakaar se surakshit kiya gaya he
 Object code of a computer program is published, but not everyone's source code is published
 jin kamputer program ke sorce code prakashit kiye jate hai unamem to ve copirite se surakshit hote hai
 But computer programs whose source code is not published are protected like trade secret
 sorce code se object code compail karnaa aasaan he; yah hameshaa kiya jaataa he or isi tarah program likhaa jaataa he
 But the opposite is that it is impossible to find the source code from the object code, but it is very difficult and expensive
 is par reverse ingeneering kaa kanoon bhi lagu hota he
 That is why the source code is not published
 ise gopneey rakh kar, ise zyada aasaani se surakshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Reverse engineering is also an interesting subject, more on this sometime
 open sorce sauftware main sorce code hameshaa prakashit hota he
 What kind of authority its writers have over it depends on the terms of the licenses under which they are published
 open sorce sauftware main kuch license kii sharten use copileft karti hai
 It is also known as free software or GPOLD software
 in software ko koi bhi vyakti muft main downlod kar saktaa he, istemaal kar saktaa he, vitareet kar saktaa haievam isame apni jarurat ke mutabik badlaav bhi kar saktaa he
 Open source software is a wonderful tool of technology, science and art, not just mechanical content
 isane computer jagat main ek kranti kii shuruyaat kar di he
 Only open source software fulfills the dream of making computer technology accessible to more people all over the world
 sayan yaa acharya sayan vedon ke sarvamaanya bhashyakarta the
 Sayan has practiced many texts, but the vertex of his fame is Vedbhashya
 inase pehle kisi kaa likhaa, chaaron vedon kaa bhashya nahin miltaa
 He was the commander and chief of the Vijayanagara Empire for 24 years
 europe ke praarambhik vaidic vidwaan tathaa aadhunik bharat ke shri arobindo tathaa shriram sharma acharya bhi inke bhashya ke prashansak rahe hai
 After writing the corpus of the Vedic words of Yask, the commentary of Sayan is well accepted
 sayan ne apni rachanaaon main apane charitra ke vishay main aavashyak tathyon kaa nirdesh kiya he
 They were residents of South India
 inke pita kaa naam tha mayan or mata kaa shrimati
 His gotra was Bhardwaj
 krishna yajurveda kii taittiriya shakha ke anuyaayi shrotriy the
 His elders were the chief ministers and spiritual masters of Maharaja Harihar, the founder of the Vijayanagara Empire
 unka naam tha - madhavacharya jo apane jivan ke antim samay main shrungerypeeth ke vidyacharan swami ke naam se adhipati hue the
 The name of Anuj of Sayan was Bhognath who was the general secretary of Sangamanresh and a great poet
 sayan ne apane alankaar sudhanidhi naamak granth main apane teen putron kaa namollekh kiya he jinamein kampan sangeet shaastra main praveen the, mayan gadhy-padya rachana main vichkshan kavi the tathaa shingan veda kii kramjata aadi paathon ke marmajna vaidic the
 a clear introduction to the names of Sayan's refugees is evident from the adherence to Vedic languages and other texts
 sayan shashan kaary main bhi daksh the tathaa sangram ke maidan main sena nayak ke kaary main bhi ve nipun na the
 Sayan had relations with these four Rajyans of Vijayanagar - Kampan, Sangam, Bukka and Harihar
 inamen se kampan sangam pratham ke dwitiya putr the
 And was Anuj of Harihar i who founded the Vijayanagara Empire

 In about twenty five years, Sayanacharya appears to have commented on the Vedas
 is prakaar sayan kaa aavirbhaav 15veen shatee vikrami ke prathamardh main sampann hua
 Sayan's life was so influenced by Agraj Madhava and it was mixed with him that even the Pandits had enough doubt about their separate personalities
 iskaa niraakaran prathmat: aavashyak he
 Madhvacharya was the shikhamani of Indian scholars in the 14th century
 ve veda, dharamshastra tathaa mimasaa ke prakand pandit hi na the, pratyut vedon ke uddharak tathaa vaidic dharm ke prachaarak ke rup main unki khyaati aaj bhi dhoomil nahin hui he
 It is the result of his spiritual teachings and political inspiration that he established the Vijayanagara Empire in the form of Maharaja Harihar Rai
 madhavacharya kaa is prakaar is samrajya kii sthapana main purna sahyog tha at: ve rajya kaary ke sucharu sanchaalan ke liye pradhanmantri ke pad par bhi pratishthit hue
 It was his inspiration that these two siblings made the revival of Vedic culture the ultimate goal of their empire and they succeeded in this auspicious task
 falat: ham madhavacharya ko 14veen shatee main dakshin bharat main jaayman vaidic punarjagrati kaa agradoot maan sakate hai
 Madhav propounded many original texts for the widespread spread of epistemology and theology - antim granth kii rachana ke vishay main aalochak ndehshil bhale hon, parantu purvanibaddh chhahon granth madhavacharya kii asandigdh rachanaayen hai
 Madhwacharya retired after serving the authority of the minister for many years and leading the empire towards the desired attainment and sat on the honorable bench of Sringeri
 inkaa is ashram kaa naam tha - vidyaarany
 Even at this time, he made the Peetha dynamic and propounded a book called Panchadashi, which is an extremely popular book for understanding the elements of Advaita Vedanta
 vijaynagar samraat kii sabha main amaatya madhav, madhavacharya se nitant pruthak vyakti the jinhone sutasamhita ke upar taatparydipika naamak vyakhya likhi he
 It is to these Madhavacharya that the order to write Sayan's commentary on the Vedas and to inspire him
 isi kaaran sayanane vedbhaashyako "madhaveey vedarthprakash" naam diya he
 The introduction of the three gurus of Sayan is found in his texts- sayanacharya 'vedbhashyakaar' kii khyaati se mandit hai
 But in addition to the Vedic interpreters, there is the power of his published texts, many of which are still unpublished
 in granthon ke naam hai- Subhashit Sudhanidhi - a succinct compilation of policy sentences
 kampan bhoopal kesamay kii rachana hone se yah unka aadya granth prathit hota he
 Atonement Sudha Nidhi - Also known as Karmavipak, this book presents a description of the atonement theme of Dharma Shastra
 alankaar sudhaa nidhi - alankaar kaa pratipadak yah granth das unmeshon main vibhakt tha
 Often the overall examples of this book are related to the life-style of Sayan
 abhi tak keval teen unmesh praapt hai
 Purushartha Sudhanidhi - This vivid compilation of mythological verses representing the four Purusharthas of religion, meaning, work and salvation was written under the direction of Bukk Maharaj
 ayurveda sudhanidhi - ayurveda vishyak is granth kaa nirdesh upar nirdisht san
 3 vaale granth main kiya gaya he
 Yajna Tantra Sudhanidhi - This treatise on the subject of Yagyanushthan is the creation of the reign of Harihara II
 dhaatuvritti - panineey dhaatuon kii yah vishad tathaa vistrut vritti apni vidvatta tathaa pramanikta ke kaaran vaiyakarnon main vishesh rup se prakhyat he
 This is a doubtless creation of Sayan even though it is known as Madhaviya Dhatravarti - its introduction is evident from the subtext of the book
 vedbhaashya - yah ek granth na hokar anek granthon kaa dyotak hai
 Sayan made his epoch-making commentary on the four Vedas of Vedas, certain Brahmins and certain Aranyakas
 inhone paanch samhitaon tathaa 13 brahman aaranyakon ke upar apane bhashyon kaa nirmaan kiya jinke naam is prakaar hai- Sainacharya himself was a Brahmin, scholar of the Taittiriya branch under Krishnayajurveda
 falat: prathmat: unhone apni taittiriya samhita or tatsambaddha brahman aaranyak kaa bhashya likhaa, ananthar unhone rugveda kaa bhashya banaaya
 The commentary of the Atharvaveda is the last among the Samhita speakers, just as the Satapathabhasya is the last in the Brahmin languages
 in donon bhashyon kaa pranat pranayan sayan ne apane jivan ke sandhyakaal main harihar dwitiya ke shasankaal main sampann kiya
 Sayan has named his languages as "madhviya Vedarthaprakash"
 in bhashyon ke naam ke saath "madhaveey" visheshan ko dekhakar anek aalochak inhen sayan kii ni:sandigdh rachana maanane se parad
mukh hote hai, parantu is andeh ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 Madhav Madhav of Sayan was the inspirational preacher of the kings of Vijayanagar
 unheen ke upadesh se maharaj harihar tathaa bukkaraay vaidic dharm ke punaruddhar ke mahneey kaary ko agrasar karne main tatpar hue
 These Mahapatis had given the burden of writing the commentaries of the Vedas to Madhava, but due to their involvement in the odd task of governance, they placed this important weight on their shoulders only
 sayan ne rugveda bhashya ke upodghaat main is baat kaa ullekh kiya he
 As a result, it is not surprising for Madhav to be associated with his name as he is the motivator and imperative in the creation of these languages
 yah to sayan kii ore se apane agraj ke prati bhuyasi shraddha kii dyotak ghatana he
 That is why metalwork, also, even after being called "madhaviya", is a doubtless creation of Sayan, which he has clearly mentioned in the epilogue of the book - vedbhaashyon ke ek kartrutv hone main katipay aalochak andeh karte hai
 The Mysore inscription of Samvat 1443 shows that the Vedic route founder Maharajadhiraj Harihar honored and honored three Brahmans named chaturveda-bhasya-promoter Narayana Vaipayyaji, Narhari Somayaji and Pandhari Dixit in front of Vidyaranya Sripad Swami
 is shilaalekh kaa samay tathaa vishay donon mahatvapurn hai
 The term "chaturveda-bhashya-prakrutta" available in it signifies the fact that these three Brahmins did special work in the creation of the Vedic languages
 prathit hota he, in panditon ne sainako vedbhaashyonke pranaynmen saahayya diya tha or isiilie vidyaarany swami ke samaksh unka satkar karnaa ukt anumaan kii pushti karata he
 It is not possible for one person to have so many verses
 falat: sayan is vidvamandali ke netaa ke rup main pratishthit the or us kaal ke mahneey vidwaanon ke sahyog se hi yah kaary sampann hua tha
 Vedas were interpreted even before Sayan
 kuch uplabdh bhi hai
 But such a well-known commentary on the entire scripture of the Vedas was not produced before
 sayan kaa yah vedbhaashya avashya hi yaajik vidhi-vidhaanon kii drushti se rakhkar likhaa gaya he, parantu iskaa yah matlab nahin ki unhone veda ke aadhyatmik arth kii ore sanket na kiya ho
 The meaning of Vedic mantras was first mentioned in Brahmin texts and based on this, the work of the meaning of words in Nighantu and the elaboration of those meanings in Nirukta was done
 nirukt main ine-gine mantron kaa hi taatpary unmilit he
 For the disclosure of the meaning and meaning of such a huge Vedic Vay Maya, only Sayan is credited
 veda ke visham durg ke rahasy kholane ke liye sayan bhashya sachmuch chaabi kaa kaam karata he
 Today the new methods of Vedarth epistemology may have been born, but the entry of the Pandits into the Vedas of the epistemology is the result of the efforts of Sayan itself
 aaj kaa vedarth parishili aalochak acharya sayan kaa vishesh rup se rini he
 Western scholars, such as Max Müller, have increased the pace in Vedic literature only on this topic
 vedarth mimasaa ke itihaas main sayan kaa naam suvarnaksharon main likhane yogya he

 a khudi toilet usually has three main parts: a crater on the ground, a small slab or floor, and a shelter
 The crater is typically at least 3 meters deep and 1 meter wide
 The World Health Organization suggests that they should be built at a reasonable distance from home, balancing the issues of easy access versus odor
 To minimize the risk of pollution, the distance from ground water and upper surface water should be as far as possible
 The hole in the slab should not be larger than 25 cm to prevent children from falling into it
 Light should not be allowed to enter the pit to prevent flies from entering
 For this, the lid may need to be used to cover the hole in the floor when it is not being used
 When the pit is filled up to 0
5 meters from the top, So it should either be evacuated or a new pit should be built and taken to a new place or a new one should be constructed
 Management of sewage sludge extracted from the pit is complex
 If this work is not done properly then both the environment and health are at risk

 The business revolution gave birth to a new economic ideology
 iskaa prarambh solahavin sadi main hua
 This new economic ideology has been called commercialism, mercantilism or tradeism
 france main is vichaardhaara ko colbertwaad or germany main kemralism kaha gaya
 In 1776 AD, the famous economist Adam Smith also discussed it in his book 'the Wealth of Nations'
 vaanijyawad se abhipraay us aarthik vichaardhaara se he jo pashchimi europe ke deshon main visheshkar france, england or germany main solahavi or satrahavin sadi main prasaarit hui thi or atharahavin sadi ke madhya tak iskaa khub vikaas hua
 The notion of commercialism is related to international trade and the money derived from it
 is vaanijyawad ke siddhant ke anusaar krishi or uske utpaadan kii kuch seemaa tak hi vruddhi kar sakate hai
 Agriculture can be economically unproductive after some extent, but there is no limit to the growth and expansion of industries, businesses and commerce trade
 audyogikaran se or vyapaar kii niyamit vruddhi se desh sona-chaandi praapt kar samrudh or shaktishaalee hoga
 This is the basic principle of commercialism
 vaanijyawad main vyapaaree varg, vyavasthit, sunishchit or niyamit vaanijya-vyapaar or sone-chaandi kii prapti or sanghathan par adhik bal diya gaya
 "get more gold and be more powerful" was the slogan of commercialism

 If necessary, some specific industries of the state should be protected and foreign trade should be encouraged
 antarrajjiy vyapaar se dhan prapti yudhon main vijay kaa aadhaar he
 Favorable and balanced trade - To get enough money in trade, sell a large amount of merchandise to foreign countries, but get minimum quantity of goods from abroad to your country
 iskaa arth yah he ki desh nunatam aayaat karen or adhiktam niryaat kare
 With this, the country will get precious metals - gold and silver - to export, and with minimal imports, very little money will have to be sent out to foreign countries
 is siddhant ko anukool or santulit vyapaar kehete hai
 The prices of imported goods and commodities should not exceed the prices of exported goods and goods
 aayaat or niryaat main anukool santulan hona chahie
 By adopting this system, there will be more production in the country, more money will be in circulation, capitalism will be encouraged and the country will be economically strong
 audyogic pratibandh or vyapaarik niyantran - desh main udyog-vyavsaayon ko rajkeey protsaahan dekar unamem adhikadhik vruddhi karne se kahin atyaadhik utpaadan nahin ho jaae

 The state has to give special incentives to boost exports
 isi prakaar aayaat par kar ke rup main niyantran lagaana padate hai, jisase ki maal atyaadhik aayaat nahin ho jaae
 Import facilities are provided only to certain companies
 ise audyogic pratibandh or vyapaarik niyantran kehete hai
 New trading markets and colonies - To obtain trade markets abroad for consumption of finished goods sent out of the country and from there to obtain raw materials for the industry and businesses of the country
 aisi vyapaarik mandiyaan praapt karne ke liye shaktishaalee rajyon ne videshon main apane upnivesh basaaye jahaan rajya main bani hui vastuon ko saralata se laabhprad daron par bechaa ja saktaa tha
 Raw materials from the markets of these colonies could also be easily bought at cheaper prices and imported into the country
 saste daamon par kaccha maal uplabdh ho jane se desh ke kal-kaarkaanon or udyogon main kam laagat par adhik utpaadan hoga
 This will benefit the country more financially
 is prakaar vaanijyawad ne upniveshwaad or samrajyavad kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Sea Trips and Geographical Discoveries - Daring sailors such as Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Amerigo, Magellan, Jan Kebat made many risky sea voyages to discover new countries

 Western countries of Europe especially Spain, Portugal, Holland, France and England established their colonies and trading cities in newly discovered countries
 in upniveshon se chamada, loha, rui oon aadi kaccha maal praapt kar apane desh main inase naveen vastuen nirmit kar upniveshon ko niryaat ke rup main bheji or badale main vahaan se prachur maatra main swarna or chaandi praapt kii
 This led to accumulation of capital, increased import-export and made the country prosperous

 vaigyanik anveshanon ke aadhaaron par udyog-dhandhon main adhikadhik utpaadan or vyapaar main vastuon kaa adhikadhik kray-vikray hone laga
 This increased currency circulation and led to the beginning and development of the modern banking system
 bainkon ne apane jamaa dhan ko anya vyapaariyon, vyavsaayiyon or udyogpatiyon ko uski saakh par udhaar diya or unke vyapaarik vastuon ke kray-vikray sambandhi bhugtan ko saralata se kiya
 This gave greater encouragement to commercialism

 Dental caries, also known as dental caries or perforation, is a disease in which bacterial processes damage the hardening of the tooth
 ye utak kramshah tuutane lagate hai, jisase dant-kshay utpann ho jate hai
 Tooth decay is caused by two bacteria: Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus
 If left untreated, the disease can result in pain, tooth loss, infection, and even death in extreme conditions
 vartmaan main, danta-kshay puure vishwa main sabase aam beemaari bana hua he
 The study of dental caries is called tuberology

 Tooth decay is caused by a specific type of acid-producing bacteria that damages teeth in the presence of fermentable carbohydrates, such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose
 daanton kii khanij saamagree lactic amla ke kaaran hone vaali amlata-vruddhi ke prati samvedansheel hoti he
 Typically, a tooth has a continuous process of demineralization and remineralization between teeth and saliva

 danta-kshay kaa vargeekaran sthaan, hetuvigyaan, vikaas kii dar or prabhavit sakht utakon ke aadhaar par kiya ja saktaa he
 These classifications can be used to describe a specific case of tooth decay, so that others can be informed of the situation more accurately and at the same time be informed of the severity of tooth decay
 
 saamanytah sthiti ke aadhaar par vargeekaran karne par kshati ke do prakaar hote hai: chikani sataha par milane vaali kshati or gaddhon va daraaron main milane vaali kshati
 chikani sataha par hone vaali kshati kaa sthaan, vikaas or shrenee gaddhon va daraaron main hone vaali kshati se bhinn hota he

 Blake developed a classification system that is widely used and is based on the condition of tooth decay
 mul vargeekaran main danta-kshayon ko paanch samoohon main rakhaa gaya tha, jinhen shabd “shrenee ” tathaa ek roman ank ke dwaara suchit kiya jaataa tha
 Decay in pits and crevices is reported as Category I; The damage on smooth surface is further divided into Category II, Category III, Category IV and Category V
 danta-kshay ke blake ke vargeekaran main ek shrenee VI bhi joda gaya tha or yah bhi chikani sataha par hone vaali kshati kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Pits and cracks are structural marks on the tooth from which enamel turns inward
 daraaron kaa nirmaan khaanchon ke vikaas ke dauraan hota he, lekin us sthaan par sthit dantabalk puri tarah judaa hua nahin hota
 As a result, a deep linear crater is formed on the enamel's surface structure, which provides a place for dental caries to develop and thrive
 daraaren adhikanshtah pasch daanton kii samrodhak sataha or jambhika par sthit agr daanton kii talvya sataha par sthit hoti hai
 The pits are small, needle-shaped holes, found mostly at the ends or transverse sections of the grooves
 vishisht rup se, charvnak daanton kii bahari satahon par kapol gadde paae jate hai
 For all types of pits and crevices, the highly enamel-folded enamel makes it difficult to maintain oral health care on these surfaces, causing dental damage to develop in these areas is more common
 daanton kii samrodhak parat daant kii kul parat kaa 12
5% hoti he, lekin kul danta-kshayon kaa 50% se adhik bhaag inhen par paaya jaataa he
 90% of total dental caries occur in pits and crevices of children's teeth
 gaddhon va daraaron main hone vaale ksharan kii pahchaan kar paanaa kabhi-kabhi kathin ho saktaa he
 As caries increases, enamel decay near the tooth surface begins to progressively increase in depth
 ek baar jab yah kshay dant-utak or dantabalk ke sangyojan-sthal ke dant-utak par pahunchataa he, to yah ksharan tezi se parshvik rup se failata he
 Within dentin, this erosion follows a triangular pattern, which is directed towards the tooth pulp
 ksharan ke is pattern kaa varnan vishisht rup se do tribhuj ke dwaara kiya jaataa he, jinke aadhaar diije par ek duusare se jude hote hai
 This base-to-base pattern is the typical pattern of erosion of a pit and crack, as opposed to erosion on a smooth surface
 chikani sataha par hone vaale ksharan ke teen prakaar hote hai
 Proximal caries, also known as interspersed caries, occur on the smooth surface between the proximal teeth
 mul ksharan daanton kii mul satahon par hota he
 The third type of erosion that occurs on a smooth surface occurs on any other smooth surface of the tooth
 samipsth ksharan kii pahchaan karnaa sarvaadhik kathin hota he
 Often this type of caries cannot be identified humanely by seeing or by a dental investigator
 Proximal caries form gravelly just below the point of contact of two teeth
 iske parinamswaroop, shuruaati charan main hi samipsth ksharan kii pahchaan karne ke liye ek radiograph kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In Blake's classification system, proximal caries on posterior teeth are called category II caries
 agle daanton par hone vaale samipsth ksharan main yadi krintak chor shaamil na ho, to ise shrenee III main rakhaa jaataa he or yadi krintak chor shaamil ho, to ise shrenee IV main rakhte hai
 Original caries, sometimes described as a type of smooth-surfaced caries, are the third most common type of caries and usually occur when the original surfaces have been exposed to gingival subsidence
 
 If the gums are healthy, the development of root caries is unlikely because the bacterial plaque cannot reach the original surfaces
 The parent surfaces are more vulnerable to demineralization process than enamel because enamel begins to demineralize at ph 6
7, which is higher than enamel's delicate ph
 iske baavjood, dantabalk ksharan kii apeksha mul ksharan ke vikaas ko rokna adhik saral he kyonki dantabalk kii tulana main mul main fluoride kaa punauvasoshana adhik hota he
 Compared to intramuscular surfaces, substantive caries are more likely to occur on the lingual surfaces than on the gingival surfaces
 jabadon par sthit charvnak daant mul ksharan ke sabase aam sthaan hai, jiske baad jabadon par sthit agracharvanak, jambhika par sthit agravarti, jambhika par sthiti pashchavarti or jabade par sthit agravarti daant aate hai
 Injuries are also possible on the smooth surfaces of teeth
 chunki ye antahsamipsth kshetron ke alaava chikani sataha ke sabhi kshetron main hoti hai, atah is prakaar ke ksharan kii pahchaan karnaa saral hota he or ye plak tathaa ksharan ke nirmaan ko protsaahit karne vaale bhojan se jude hote hai
 Under Blake's classification, erosion on gums located near anatomical or gingival surfaces is marked as Category V
 shrenee VI pashchasth daanton ke siron or agrastha daanton ke krintak chhoron ke liye arakshit he
 In addition to the two categories described earlier, caries injury can also be described by their position on a specific surface of a tooth
 daant kii jo sataha gaalon yaa hothon se sabase nikat hoti he, un par hone vaale ksharan ko “ananmukh ksharan kaha jaataa he or jeebh kii ore sthit sataha par hone vaala ksharan, jiheey ksharan kehalaata he
 Erosive caries is further called cupola and bracket
 samrodhak ksharan pashchasth daanton kii chabane vaali satahon par paaya jaataa he
 Rodent caries is found on the chewing surfaces of the anterior teeth
 ksharanon kaa varnan “madhyam " athwa "duurastha " ke rup main bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Moderate caries refers to a location on the teeth that is closest to the midline of the face, which is located on the vertical axis between the eyes down to the nose and the middle rodent's contact
 madhya rekha se dur sthit daanton kii sthiti kaa varnan duurastha ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 In some instances, the damage is also described in some other way, indicating its cause
 “shishu bottle ksharan”, “praarambhik shishav ksharan” athwa “shishu bottle daant ksharan” asthaayee daanton vaale chote bacchon main paaya jane vaala ek pattern he
 It is most likely to affect the teeth located on the anterior part of the jaw, but all teeth can be affected
 is prakaar ke ksharan ko yah naam is tathy ke aadhaar par mila he ki yah ksharan saamanytah shishuon ko unki bottle main rakhe mithe dravon ke saath sone kii anumati dene athwa shishuon din main kai baar mithe drav pilaane ke parinamswaroop hota he
 Another pattern of caries is "highly diffuse caries", which indicates advanced or excessive caries on multiple surfaces of multiple teeth
 atyadhik failanevaala ksharan munh sookhne kii beemaari se grast, munh ke swasthya kaa dhyaan na rakhane vaale, uttejk kaa prayog karne vaale tathaa / yaa chini kaa bahut adhik seven karne vaale vyaktiyon main dekha ja saktaa he
 If excessive diffuse erosion is due to preceding radiation on the head and neck, it can be described as radiation-affected erosion

 Dr
 Miller stated in 1887 that "dental caries is a chemical-parasitic process, which consists of two stages - enamel denervation, resulting in complete destruction, and enamel tissue as the primary stage, followed by The residual solution of the softened residue occurs
 " apni is pariklpana main, dow miller ne teen karkon ko aavashyak bhoomikaayen aavantit kin: To inform the progress rate and past history of caries, temporary details can be applied to them

 It is often found on fillings and other dental repercussions
 duusari ore, praarambhik ksharan kaa prayog kisi aise sthaan par hue kshay kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, jisane pehle kisi kshay kaa anubhav na kiya ho
 Paused caries describes an injury on a tooth that has previously been demineralized, but which has been re-privatized before a perforation has occurred
 fluoride upachaar kaa prayog karnaa punarkhatikaran main sahaayak ho saktaa he
 Depending on the tissue that is affected, it is possible to describe caries as enamel, dentin, or dentinal caries
 apane vikaas ke prarambh main, ksharan dwaara keval dantabalk ko prabhavit kiya janaa sambhav he
 Once the expansion of caries reaches the deep layer of dentin, the term "dentin caries" is used
 chunki cementem daanton kii jadon ko dhankane vaala sakht utak he, atah saamanytah yah kshay dwaara tab tak prabhavit nahin hota, jab tak ki daant kii jaden munh main ujagar na ho rahi hon
 haalanki, “dant-mul ksharan” shabdaawalee kaa prayog daanton kii jadon par hone vaale kshay kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, lekin bahut hi durlabh sthitiyon main hi yah ksharan keval dant-mul ko prabhavit karata he
 The roots have a very thin layer of cementum on top of a large layer of dentin and thus most caries affecting dentin also affect dentin
 yah sambhav he ki ksharan kaa anubhav kar rahe vyakti ko isaki jaankaree na ho
 The earliest sign of a new carious lesion is in the form of a chapped white patches on the tooth surface, indicating that enamel is demineralized in that area
 ise praarambhik kshay kaha jaataa he
 When demineralization of the wound continues, it can turn brown, but eventually it will turn into a coat
 Before the hole is formed, this process is reversible, but once the hole is formed, the damaged tooth structure cannot be regenerated
 Any lesion that appears brown and shiny indicates that dental caries was present at some point, but the demineralization process has stalled and only one scar remains
 mand prathit hone vaala ek bhura daag sambhawatah sakriy ksharan kaa ek sanket hota he
 When enamel and dentin are destroyed, this perforation becomes symptomatic
 daant ke prabhavit kshetra apana rang badal dete hai or chune par mulaayam mahasoos hote hai
 Once the caries passes through enamel, the tooth ducts, which have a passage leading to the vein of the tooth, are exposed, causing pain in the teeth
 garm, thande yaa mithe bhojan va peya ke sampark main aane par yah dard or adhik bad saktaa he
 Due to tooth decay, problems like bad breath and distorted taste can also occur
 atyadhik viksit sthitiyon main, daant main hua sankraman aas-paas ke narm utakon tak bhi fail saktaa he
 Complications such as cavernous thrombosis and Ludbig's mumps can also pose a life threat

 Dental caries can occur on any surface of the tooth that is exposed to the pore of the mouth, but it cannot occur on the salvaged structure within the bone
 daanton ko prabhavit karne vaali kuch vishisht bimaariyaan va vikrutiyaan hai, jinke kaaran kisi vyakti main ksharan kaa khatra bad saktaa he
 Amelogenesis imperfecta, which occurs between 1 in 718 and one in 14,000 people, is a disease in which enamel is either not fully formed or is insufficiently formed and can fall out of the teeth
 donon hi sthitiyon main, daanton main kshay kaa khatra bad saktaa he kyonki dantabalk daant kii raksha kar paane main sakasham nahin hota
 In most individuals, the primary cause of dental caries is not teeth deformities or diseases
 Ninety-six percent of the tooth enamel is made up of minerals

 5
5 ke ek piech par dantabalk kaa akhanijeekaran prarambh ho jaataa he
 There is a higher risk of erosion in dentin and dentin than enamel because they contain less mineral content
 is prakaar, jab daant kii mul satahon kaa saamana masoodon main hone vaale gaddhon yaa masoodon se judi anya bimariyon se hota he, to ksharan jaldi viksit ho sakate hai
 However, even in a healthy oral environment, there is a risk of tooth decay
 daanton kii sanrachana ksharan ke nirmaan kii sambhaavna ko prabhavit kar sakati he
 Where the deep grooves of teeth are more numerous and exaggerated, there is a greater possibility of development of pits and cracks
 saath hi, yadi daanton ke bich ann-kan dabe hue hon, to ksharan kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Many types of oral bacteria are found in our mouths, but it is believed that only a few specific species of those bacteria are responsible for tooth decay, including Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacilli
 lactobacilas acedophilas, actinomices viscosas, nocardia esapeepi
 or stryptococas mutans kaa danta-kshay, visheshtah danta-mul main hone vaale kshay, ke saath nikat sambandh hota he
 Bacteria around the teeth and gums accumulate in a viscous, cream-like substance called plaque, which acts as a bio-covering
 kuch vishisht sthanon par plak kaa ekatra hona anya sthanon kii tulana main aam hota he
 Like the point of contact between teeth, the grooves found on the chewing surfaces of the molars and forearm teeth also provide microscopic occlusion
 masoodon par plak bhi ekatrit ho saktaa he
 Bacteria present in a person's mouth convert glucose, fructose, and most commonly sucrose into acids such as lactic acid, etc
 through a glycolytic process called fermentation
 yadi in amlon ko daant ke sampark main chhod diya jaae, to ve akhanijeekaran kaa kaaran ban sakate hai, jo ki khanijon ke vilyan kii prakriya he
 However this process is kinetic because remineralization can also occur if this acid is neutralized by saliva or mouthwash
 fluoride toothpaste athwa danta varnish punarkhanijeekaran main sahaayak ho sakate hai
 If demineralization continues for a long time, such a large amount of mineral-content may be lost that the remaining soft biomass decomposes, forming a coat or hole
 aisi sharkaraaon dwaara danta ksharan ke vikaas par daale jane vaale prabhaav ko ksharanakarita kehete hai
 Although sugars are a bound glucose and fructose unit, they are actually more corrosive than a mixture of equal amounts of glucose and fructose
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki jeevanu glucose va fructose kii up-ikaayiyon ke bich upasthit bandha se urja praapt karte hai
 S
 by converting sucrose into a highly viscous substance called dexran polysaccharide by enzyme dextransucranase
 Mutans stick to the bio-layer positioned on the tooth
 ksharan ke vikaas kii sambhaavna is baat se bhi prabhavit hoti he ki daant kis aavriti par ksharankari vaataavaranon ke sampark main aate hai
 After a meal or snack, bacteria present in the mouth metabolize sugars, resulting in the formation of an acidic by-product that lowers the ph
 samay ke saath-saath, laar kii pratirohak kshamta or daant kii sataha kii vighatit khanij samagri ke kaaran piech punah saamaanya sthiti par laut aata he
 During each contact with the acidic environment, some part of the non-organic material present on the surface of the teeth disintegrates and can remain decomposed for two hours
 chunki, in amleey avadhiyon ke dauraan daanton par ksharan kaa khatra hota he, atah danta ksharan kaa vikaas amleey sampark kii aavriti par atyadhik nirbhar hota he
 If there is sufficient amount of appropriate carbohydrate in the food, then this erosion process can start within a few days of tooth eruption in the mouth
 pramaan is baat kii ore sanket karte hai ki fluoride upachaar is prakriya ko dhimaa kar dete hai
 Proximal caries take an average of four years to pass through the enamel of a permanent tooth
 chunki mul sataha ko dhankane vaala dant-mul sheersh ko dhankanevaale dantabalk jitna tikaoo nahin hota, atah mul ksharan ke saamanytah anya satahon par hone vaale ksharanon kii tulana main tezi se badhata he
 This development and loss of mineralization on root erosion is 2
5 times faster than erosion on enamel
 atyadhik gambhir maamalon, jinamein maukhik swasthya bahut kharaab ho or bhojan main kinvan-yogya carbohydrate kii maatra bahut adhik ho, main ksharan ke kaaran daant ke ugane ke kuch maah ke bheetar hi chhidr utpann ho sakate hai
 For example, this can happen if children consistently consume sugary drinks from baby bottles
 laar main kami va ksharan main vruddhi ke bich aapasi sambandh hota he kyonki kuch vishisht khaadya-padaarthon dwaara nirmit amleey vaataavaran ko santulit karne ke liye laar kii pratirohak kshamta upasthit nahin hoti

 Examples include Sjögren's syndrome, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, and sarcoidosis
 antihistamine or avsaadarodhi dawaaen bhi laar ke pravaah ko khandit kar sakati hai
 Catalysts, most notoriously methylemphetamine, also greatly block the flow of saliva
the tendency of bad oral health is found in those who abuse the utprerakon kaa durupyog karne waalon main bure maukhik swasthya kii pravriti paayi jaati he
 Tetrahydrocannabinol, the active chemical substance found in the cannabis plant, also stops the flow of saliva almost completely and this condition is colloquially called "cotton mouth"
 atyadhik sharkarayukta peya tathaa apaushtik khaadya padaarth kii atyadhik maatra ke saath milakar yah bhaang kaa seven karne waalon main ksharan ke vistaar main bahut adhik vruddhi kar detaa he
 In addition, sixty-three percent of the most commonly given drugs in the United States have been reported to have dry mouth
 sir or gardan kaa vikiran upachaar bhi laar-granthi main sthit koshikaon ko prabhavit kar saktaa he, jisase ksharan ke nirmaan kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Use of tobacco may increase the risk of building erosion
 dhoomraviheen tambaakoo ke kuch brandon main ucch sharkara maatra hoti he, jisase ksharan kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Tobacco use is an important risk factor for teeth-related diseases that push the gums back
 jab masoode kaa daanton se judaav khatm ho jaataa he, to mul sataha munh main adhik darshneey ho jaati he
 If this happens, basic caries is a worrying factor because the dentin that covers the teeth is demineralized by acids more easily than enamel
 vartmaan main, dhumrapaan or shirobandh ksharan ke bich ek anaupchaarik sambandh kaa samarthan karne vaale paryaapt pramaan uplabdh nahin hai, lekin ye pramaan dhumrapaan or mul-sataha ksharan ke bich ek sambandh kii ore avashya sanket karte hai
 Lead exposure in intrauterine and neonates encourages dental caries

 Enamel is a highly mineralized acellular tissue and is damaged by a chemical process initiated by caries bacteria
 jab ye jeevanu sharkara kaa seven karne lagate hai or iskaa prayog apni swayan kii urja ke liye karne lagate hai, tab ve lactic amla utpann karte hai
 The effects of this process include demineralization of the particles present in enamel, which is caused by the passage of time as well as acids and continues until bacteria physically penetrate the dentin
 Enamel rods, which are the basic units of enamel structure, are located perpendicularly from the tooth surface to the dentin
 chunki ksharan ke dwaara dantabalk kaa akhanijeekaran saamanytah dantabalk kii chad kii disha main hi hota he, atah dantabalk main gaddhon va chhidron ke bich bhinn-bhinn tribhujaakar pattern tathaa chikani-sataha vaale ksharan viksit hote hai ki daant ke do kshetron main dantabalk kii chhadon kii sthiti bhinn-bhinn hoti he
 When enamel loses its minerals and dental caries begins to develop, many clear areas develop in enamel, which can be seen with a light microscope
 dantabalk kii sabase gahari parat se dantabalk kii sataha tak, jin kshetron kii pahchaan kii gai he, ve hai: parbhasi kshetra, kaala kshetra, ghaav kaa mukhya-bhaag or sataha kshetra 
 The translucent zone is the first visible sign of erosion and occurs when one to two percent loss of minerals occurs
 kaale kshetra main dantabalk kaa thodaa-sa punarkhanijeekaran hota he, jo is baat kaa ek udhaaharan prastut karata he ki danta kshay kaa vikaas vaikalpik parivartanon ke saath kis prakaar ek sakriy prakriya he
 The area of most demineralization and destruction is the main part of the wound itself
 sataha kshetra apekshaakrit khanij-yukt bana rahata he or tab tak upasthit rahata he, jab tak ki daant kii sanrachana ek chhidr main na badal jaae
 Unlike enamel, dentin responds to the progression of dental caries
 daant ke nirmaan ke baad, dantabalk ko utpann karne vaale aminoblast dantabalk kii rachana puri ho jane par nasht ho jate hai or isaliye baad main dantabalk ke nasht ho jane par ve uski punarrachana nahin kar sakate
 duusari ore, puure jivan-kaal ke dauraan odontoblast ke dwaara dant-utak utpaadit hota rahata he, jo goode or dant-utak ke bich sthit hota he
 Since odontoblasts are present, a catalyst, such as corrosion, can initiate a biological reaction
 in suraksha karypranaliyon main shwetapatli va tritiyak dant-utak kaa nirmaan shaamil hota he
 In dentin located from the deepest layer to enamel, the areas affected by corrosion are the area of translocation, area of destruction, and area of bacterial perforation
 parbhasi kshetra kshati kii prakriya kii aage badhati suchi kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or yah vahaan sthit hota he, jahaan praarambhik akhanijeekaran kii shuruyaat hoti he
 Areas of bacterial perforation and destruction are areas of invading bacteria and ultimately disintegration of dentin
 dant-utak kii sanrachana sookshmdarshi dhaaraon, jinhen dant-utak nalikaayen kaha jaataa he, kii ek vyavastha hoti he, jo goode vaale bhaag se bahari dant-mul yaa dantabalk kii seemaa kii ore baahar nikalati hai
 The diameter of dentinal tubules is more near the pulp and the lowest at the placenta of dentin and enamel
 kshati-prakriya puri dant-utak nalikaaon par jari rahati he, jo ki daant main gaharaai tak ksharan ke vikaas ke parinamswaroop utpann tribhujaakar pattern ke liye zimmedaar hoti hai
 The ducts also allow caries to develop rapidly
 isaki pratikriyaswaroop, nalikaaon ke bheetar upasthit drav is jeevanvik sankraman se ladane ke liye hamaare pratirohak tantra se immunoglobulin laata he
 At the same time, the mineralization of nearby tubes also increases
 iskaa parinaam nalikaaon ke nirmaan ke rup main miltaa he, jo ki jeevanvik pragati kii gati ko kam karne kaa ek prayaas he
 Additionally, when bacterial acids demineralize the hydroxyapatite particles, calcium and phosphorus are released, allowing a greater number of particles to penetrate deeper into the dentinal tubules
 ye kan ek avrodh kaa nirmaan karte hai or ksharan ke vistaar ko dhimaa karte hai
 Following these protective responses, dentin is considered to be whitish
 aisa mana jaataa he dant-utak kii nalikaaon ke bheetar upasthit dravon ke kaaran daant ke goode ke bheetar sthit dard abhigrahi sakriy ho jate hai
 Since the white dentin blocks the flow of such fluids, it is possible that the pain that would have warned of the invasion of bacteria may not have occurred before
 iske parinamswaroop, daant kii kisi bhi samvedansheeltaa ke bina danta ksharan ek lambey samay tak pragati karata rah saktaa he, jisase daant kii sanrachana kii bahut adhik haani ho sakati he
 In response to dental caries, more dentin may be produced in the pulp direction
 is nae dant-utak kaa ullekh tritiyak dant-utak ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Tertiary dentin is produced to protect the pulp from the advancing bacteria as much as possible
 jab adhik tritiyak dant-utak utpann ho jaataa he, to goode kaa aakaar ghat jaataa he
 This type of dentin is subclassified according to the presence or absence of the original odontoblast
 yadi odontoblast itane adhik samay tak batch jate hai ki ve danta kshay ke prati pratikriya de saken, to is sthiti main utpann dant-utak ko “pratikriyaatmak " dant-utak kehete hai
 If odontoblasts are destroyed, the dentin produced in this condition is called "rectal" dentin
 sudhaarak dant-utak kii sthiti main, nasht ho chuke odontoblast kii bhoomika nibhaane ke liye anya utakon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is believed that growth factors, especially tgf-beta, initiate the formation of rectal dentin by pulmonary fibroblasts and mesenchymal tissues
 sudhaarak dant-utak ausatan 1
5 μm / pratidin kii dar par viksit kiya jaataa he, lekin ise 3
5 μm / pratidin tak badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 The resulting dentin consists of irregularly shaped dentinal tubules and may not line up with pre-existing dentinal tubules
 This reduces the ability of dental caries to progress within the dentin tubules
 praathmik nidaan main prakaash ke ek achche strot, danta darpan va anveshak kii sahaayta se daant kii sabhi drishy satahon kaa nirikshan karnaa shaamil hota he
 Dental radiographs may show dental caries, especially caries between the teeth, before being visible in any other way
 bade danta ksharan aksar nangi ankhon se dekhe ja sakate hai, lekin chote ghaavon ko pahchaan paanaa kathin ho saktaa he
 Dentists use radiographic as well as visual and tactile inspection to detect erosion of pits and holes
 praarambhik, chhidr-hin ksharan kii pahchaan aksar sandigdh kshetra ke aar-paar hawa pravaahit karke kii jaati he, jo nami ko hataa detii he or akhanijeekrut dantabalk kii prakaashiya visheshtaon ko parivartit kar detii he
 Some dental researchers have warned against using dental investigators to find caries
 jin sthitiyon main daant ke kisi chote bhaag kaa akhanijeekaran prarambh ho gaya ho, lekin abhi tak koi chhidr utpann na hua ho, unamem danta anveshak se padane vaale dabaav ke kaaran chhidr kaa nirmaan ho saktaa he
 Since the process of damage can be returned by stopping the formation of the hole, it may be possible to prevent corrosion with fluoride and to reprogram the tooth surface
 jab ek chhidr upasthit ho, to daant kii kho chuki sanrachana ko badalane ke liye punarsthapana kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 At times, erosion of pits and holes can be difficult to identify
 dant-utak tak pahunchane ke liye jeevanu dantabalk kaa bhedan kar sakate hai, lekin tab bahari sataha ko punarkhanijeekrut kiya ja saktaa he, visheshtah yadi fluoride upasthit ho
 These caries, sometimes called "hidden caries", can still be seen by X-ray radiographs, but visual examination of the tooth will show that enamel is intact or minimally perforated
 daant kii nasht ho chuki sanrachana puri tarah punarnirmit nahin hoti, haalanki yadi swatchta ko iske ishtatam str par rakhaa jaae, to bahut chote kshatigrast ghaavon kaa punarkhanijeekaran sambhav ho saktaa he
 For small wounds, occasional fluoride is sometimes used to encourage remineralization
 bade ghaavon ke liye, danta kshay kii pragati ko upachaar ke dwaara roka ja saktaa he
 The goal of treatment is to maintain tooth structure and prevent further tooth destruction
 saamanytah jaldi kiya gaya upachaar der se kiye gayi upachaar kii tulana main kam dardanaak or kam kharchila hota he
 Insomniac — local, nitrous oxide "), or other recommended drugs — may be required during or after treatment to reduce pain or to relieve discomfort during treatment
 kshatigrast padaarth ke bade bhaagon ko daant se nikaalane ke liye ek danta handpis kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 a spoon is a dental device that is carefully used to remove caries, and is sometimes used when caries in the dentin reaches near the pulp
 Once the caries is removed, the lost tooth structure needs some kind of dental restoration, to bring the tooth back to its functional and elegant condition
 punarsthapanaatmak padaarthon main danta sammishran, mishrit raal, chini-mitti or swarna shaamil hai
 Mixed resin and ceramic can be made in such a way that they look similar to the natural color of the patient's teeth and are often used when beauty is a concern
 mishrit punarsthapana danta sammishran athwa swarna jitani majboot nahin hoti; kuch danta chikitsak swarna ko pichley daanton, jinamein chabane kaa bal bahut adhik hota he, ke liye ekmaatr sanstuti-yogya punarsthapana maanate hai
 When caries is very widespread, it is possible that the structure of the tooth does not have enough space to contain the restorative material within the tooth
 atah ek sheersh kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 This restoration appears like a cap and is folded over the remaining top of the tooth
 sheersh aksar swarna, chini-mitti yaa dhaatu main judi chini-mitti se bane hote hai
 In some specific conditions, endodontic treatment may be necessary to restore the tooth
 andodontic upachaar, jise “root kanal " bhi kaha jaataa he, ki anushansa tab kii jaati he, yadi daant main upasthit guda kshati-kaarak jeevanuon ke kaaran yaa chot ke kaaran nasht ho jaae
 root kanal ke dauraan, daant ke kshatigrast bhaag ke saath hi daant ke goode, nason va sanvahani utakon sahit, ko hataa diya jaataa he
 The ducts are cleaned and shaped by tools of endodontic files, then normally filled with rubber-like material, called gutta form
 daant ko bharaa jaataa he or isamen ek sheersh bhi joda ja saktaa he
 The tooth is now dead without the root canal being complete because it is devoid of any living tissue
 uchhedan bhi daanton ke ksharan kaa ek upachaar ho saktaa he
 The decision to remove a damaged tooth is made if the tooth has been damaged so much due to the degenerative process that it cannot be effectively restored
 kabhi-kabhi uchhedan par vichaar tab kiya jaataa he, yadi daant ke liye koi virdohi daant uplabdh na ho athwa jab isse bhavishya main aage koi samasya utpann ho sakati ho, jaisaa ki pragna-danta ke maamle main ho saktaa he
 Ablation may also be preferred in situations where the patient does not want to bear the expense or discomfort involved in tooth restoration
 vyaktigat swatchta dekhbhaal main pratidin thik se daant saaf karnaa or mulaayam dhaage se safai karnaa shaamil hai
 The purpose of oral hygiene is to reduce the presence of any genetic representative of the disease in the mouth
 daant saaf karne va mulaayam dhaage se safai karne kaa mukhya uddeshy plak ko hataanaa or iske nirmaan ko rokna hota he
 Mostly plaque contains bacteria
 jeevanvik plak kii maatra badhane par, jab khaadya-padaarthon main upasthit carbohydrate prayek bhojan yaa naashte ke baad daanton par chhot jate hai, to daanton par danta kshay kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 a toothbrush can be used to remove plaque on accessible surfaces, but not between the teeth or inside the pits and crevices on chewing surfaces
 If used properly, dental floss can remove plaque from the places at which otherwise proximal caries may develop
 swatchta kii anya sahaayak vidhiyon main antardant brush, water pick or mouthwash shaamil hai
 However oral health is probably more effective in preventing gum diseases than dental caries
 brush or fluoride toothpaste un gaddhon va daraaron tak nahin pahunch sakate, jinamein chabaae jate samay bhojan funs jaataa he
 )
 ghaav se hone vaale ksharan kaa khatra pratham va dwitiya agracharvanak daaton par sarvaadhik hota he
 ) vyavsaayik swatchta dekhbhaal main daanton kii niyamit jaanch va safai shaamil hoti he
 Sometimes it is difficult to remove the plaque completely and a dentist or dental hygienist may be required
 maukhik swasthya ke atirikt, danta nirikshan ke dauraan radiograph liye ja sakate hai, taaki munh ke ucch jokhim vaale kshetron main sambhavit danta ksharanon ke vikaas kii pahchaan kii ja sake
 For dental health, the frequency of sugar intake is more important than the amount of sugar consumed
 chini or anya carbohydrton kii upasthiti main, munh main sthit jeevanu aise amla utpann karte hai, jo dantabalk, dant-utak va dant-mul ko akhanijeekrut kar sakate hai
 The higher the frequency of bringing teeth into such an environment, the greater the likelihood of dental caries occurring
 Therefore, it is recommended to keep the amount of breakfast to a minimum because having breakfast provides a continuous supply of nutrition for the acid-making bacteria present in the mouth
 saath hi, bahut adhik chabaae jane vaale or chipchipe khaadya-padaarth lambey samay tak daanton par chipke rahete hai or parinamswaroop ve kisi bhojan ke ek bhaag ke rup main sabase acchhee tarah khaae jate hai
 Cleaning teeth with a brush after a meal is recommended
 bacchon ke liye, american dental assosiyeshan or european academy of pediatric dentistory sharkara-yukt peya-padaarthon kii khapat kii aavriti ko simit karne or shishuon ko neend ke dauraan shishu bottlen na dene kii anushansa karte hai
 Mothers are also advised to avoid sharing their dishes and cups with their infants, so as to prevent the transfer of bacteria from the mother's mouth
 yah paaya gaya he ki yadi doodh or chiz ke vishisht prakaaron, jaise sheder ko daanton ke liye sambhavit rup se hanikaarak bhojan kaa seven karne ke turant baad liya jaae, to ve danta kshay kaa saamana karne main sahaayak ho sakate hai
 Also, xylitol is widely used in chewing gum in some countries to protect teeth and is particularly popular in Finland's candy industry
 plak ko kam karne main zailitol sambhawatah isaliye prabhavi hota he kyonki jeevanu iskaa upyog anya sharkaraaon kii tarah kar paane main sakasham nahin hote
 yah bhi gyaat hua he ki chabane or jeebh par sthit swaad abhigrahakon kii utprerana laar ke utpaadan va mukti ko badhaati he, jisamen kuch prakritik pratirohak hote hai, jo munh main piech ke str ko us bindu tak neeche jane se rokte hai, jahaan dantabalk akhanijeekrut ho saktaa he
 The use of dental sealant is a means of prevention
 ek seelint ek patali plastic-numa parat hoti he, jise charvnak daaton kii chabane vaali satahon par lagaaya jaataa he
 This layer prevents food from getting trapped in pits and crevices within the grooves due to the pressure generated when chewing, so that the bacteria residing there are deprived of the carbohydrates they convert to acid demineralization and thus It prevents the formation of caries in pits and crevices, which are the most common form of dental caries
 bacchon ke daanton par seelint ko saamanytah charvnak daanton ke ugane ke kuch hi samay baad lagaaya jaataa he
 Older people can also benefit from dental sealants, but their dental history and the possibility of caries formation are generally considered
 danta ksharan se bachaav ke liye aksar doodh va hari subjiyon aadi jaise khaadya-padaarthon main milanevaale calcium kii anushansa kii jaati he
 It has been demonstrated that calcium and fluoride supplements reduce the incidence of dental caries
 dantabalk ke hydroxipetic kanon ko baandh kar fluoride daant ke kshay ko rokane main sahaayta karata he
 The incorporated calcium makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus to decay
 daant kii parat kii raksha ke liye fluoride ke samayik prayog kii bhi anushansa kii jaati he
 This may include fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash
 anek danta chikitsak niyamit jaanch ke ek bhaag ke rup main fluoride ke samayik prayog ko shaamil karte hai
 Other products, with little or little scientific evidence to support their efficacy in the context of regeneration, include DCPD, ACP, calcium compounds, fluorides, and enamelons
 punarkhanijeekaran kaa kaary danta chikitsak dwaara vyavsaayik rup se bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Additionally, recent research has shown that low-intensity laser radiation of aragon ion lasers can prevent the possibility of enamel corrosion and white-mark corrosion
 chunki jeevanu bure maukhik swasthya main yogadan karne vaale pramukh kaarak hai, atah danta ksharan ke liye kisi tike kii khoj karne ke liye vartmaan main anusandhan jari he
 According to information received till 2004, such a drug has been used successfully on animals, and according to information received in May 2006, it is currently in the clinical trial phase for humans
 bhojan ke baad chuing gam chabana laar ke pravaah ko badhaata he, jo amleey piech vaataavaran ko prakritik rup se kam karti he or punarkhanijeekaran ko protsaahit karti he
 Xylitol lolly and gum also inhibit the growth of Streptococcus mutans
 puure vishwa main, adhikansh bachche or anumaanit rup se nabbe pratishat vayaskon ne ksharan kaa anubhav kiya he or yah beemaari asian or latin amareeki deshon main sarvaadhik tathaa africa deshon main sabase kam prachlit he
 In the United States, dental caries is the most common chronic chronic disease of childhood and is at least five times more common than asthma
 yah bacchon main daanton ke tuutane kaa mukhya rogaatmak kaaran he
 Twenty-nine to sixty-nine percent of adults over the age of fifty experience erosion
 kuch viksit deshon main maamalon kii sankhya main kami ai he or saamanytah is kami kaa shrey behatar maukhik swasthya kii aadaton main sudhaar or fluoride upachaar jaise pratirohak upayon ko diya jaataa he
 Despite this, countries that have experienced a gross reduction in cases of dental caries also continue to have an asymmetry in the distribution of the disease
 sanyukt rajya america va europe ke bacchon kii baees pratishat jansankhya danta kshay ke kul maamalon ke saath se assi pratishat ko jhel rahi he
 a similar unequal distribution of the disease is seen throughout the world, with some children having zero or very little caries, while in other children it is very high
 australia, nepal or sweden main bacchon main danta kshay ke maamalon kii sankhya kam he, jabaki costa rika or slovakia main yah sankhya bahut adhik he
 The traditional "DMF") index is the most common method of estimating the prevalence of caries among people as well as the required dental treatment
 yah suchakank ek salaai, darpan va kapaas ke gole kaa prayog karte hue vyaktiyon ke vaastavik chikitsiya pareekshan par aadhaarit hota he
 Since the DMF index is produced without X-ray visualization, it underestimates the actual extent of the erosion and the treatment required
 danta ksharan kaa ek bahut lanbaa itihaas he
 More than a million years ago, human ancestors such as Australopithecus suffered from dental cavities
 ksharan ke vistaar main sarvaadhik vruddhi ko khan-paan main parivartanon ke saath joda jaataa rahaa he
 Archaeological evidence suggests that dental caries is an ancient disease, which was also present in prehistoric times
 navpashan kaal ke das lakh varsh puraane kapaal kaa tithi-nirdhaaran ksharan ke chihn pradarshit karata he, haalanki purv-pashaan yug va madhya-pashaan yug ke kapaal iskaa apwaad hai
 Increased cases of caries in the Neolithic period can be attributed to increased consumption of plant food, which is carbohydrate-rich
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki dakshin asia main chaaval kii kheti kii shuruyaat ke kaaran bhi ksharan ke maamalon main vruddhi hui

 misr kii sabhyataa ke saath hi, greek-roman sabhyataa main ksharan se utpann dard ke liye upachaar uplabdh the
 The rate of erosion remained low throughout the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, but it increased enormously in the Middle Ages

 In 1850, another rapid increase in erosion occurred and it is believed that this was due to extensive changes in food
