 Sometimes only the person's name is written before the name
 kuch naam spasht rup se kisi parivaar se sambandh kaa ullekh karte hai
 For example, Pashara Kolli, Naigodara Kanani
 kerala main, maanak vidhi ke anusaar parivaar kaa naam-vyakti kaa naam-jati / sheershak naam likhaa jaataa tha

 Today, the traditional nomenclature has changed and the father's name is sometimes used as a last name to suit other South Indian communities
 kerala ke isaayiyon main, ek dwitiya naam hona ek aam paddati he, jo ki unka baptism dwaara praapt naam hota he, saamanytah pratham naam dada kaa yaa kuldevataa kaa naam hota he, jaise roshni mairi jorge or anup antni philip
 Many South Indians use their ancestral village name or family business as their last name or family name
 is maamle main, kabhi-kabhi vyakti ke naam se purv uskaa kulanaam likhaa jaataa he
 Some Tamil individuals write both their village name and caste name as part of their name, for example, Madurai Mani Iyer
 Here the name of the city of Madurai and Iyer is caste

 In many cases, the second name is used as an initial, and the person's name may appear as his or her second name
 udaahranarth, “ajith abraham” jaise kisi naam kaa arth hoga “abraham kaa putr ajith”
 yadi iske baad ajith kaa koi aswin naamak putr ho, to uskaa naam aswin ajith hoga
 It is common for a Tamil woman to adopt her husband's name as her second name
 sunitha gopaalan shaadi ke baad apana naam badalakar sunitha rajeev kar sakati he
 Some South Indians use an inverted tribe
 udaahranarth, chitra vishweshwaran ek nrutyaangna hai, jinka antim naam yaa to unka gotra he yaa unke pati kaa naam he
 The use of the antonym gotra more prevalent among women is also adopted by those who immigrate to Western countries who wish to be called by their names without the need to explain the Indian nomenclature
 The names of their fathers or husbands become their family names
 pashchimi angrezi-bhashi samaajon main, jab kisi praathmik vidhyalay main ek hi naam vaale do log hon, udaahranarth, robert jones or robert smith, to aspashtataa se bachane ke unka ullekh kramshah robert je
 or robert es
 ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 But if there are two Raman in South India, each of them has only one name
 atah kulanaam ke bajaay unke adyaksharon ke rup main unke pita ke naamon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Gopal's son Raman, G
D
 Raman and Dinesh's son will be called Raman D
 Raman
 As a result, a system of initials has developed, which is mostly followed in South India
 adhiktar vidhyalay pravesh ke samay swatah hi adyakshar jod lete hai
 In some parts of Tamil Nadu, nowadays father / husband names are being used as family names in place of traditional family names
 paariwarik naam ke rup main pita / pati ke naam kaa prayog prachlan main he
 These names are also used as initials
 skulon va kalejon ke record main unke adyakshar is prakaar diye jaaenge
 In legal documents such as passports, full expanded last names will be written in place of initials
 Any of these formats will be used in other legal documents such as property deals and the father / grandfather / husband's name and / or village / town / city name will be mentioned
 Mandatory expansion of initials in multinational companies affected by passports and Western standards is a major source of confusion in South India
 udaahranarth, krishna kumaar ke putr raja gopal verma, jinhen saamanytah “ke
 raja gopal” ke naam se janaa jaataa ho, ke naam likhaa koi patr galati se “krishna kumaar raja gopal verma” ke pate par bheja ja saktaa he
 Generally, men's names begin with the initials mentioned earlier
 kuch purush apane adyaksharon ko hataa dete the or ant main apane pita kaa naam jodate the
 However, it is not a legal name and this will not change their names in official records
 For example, both P
 Chidambaram and Chidambaram Palaniappan are valid; However, the second form is not used legally
 Normally the initials are removed and the father's name is added at the end to shorten the name, such as M
 Gopal Krishnan's son G
 Raja Ravi Varma's name becomes Raja Gopal
 mahilaon ke liye, adyaksharon kii pranali kuch bhinn he
 Before marriage, a girl uses her father's initials, but after marriage she can choose to use her husband's initials
 haalia dinon main yah chalan badal gaya he or anek mahilayen, visheshtah kaamkaaji mahilayen, apane adyakshar nahin badalatin, balki apane pita ke adyaksharon kaa prayog karnaa jari rakhti hai
 This is done mainly for convenience because only the initials of the woman's father are written in the documents of the school degree and career
 kanoonee rup se koi naam badalanaa bahut jatil prakriya he, jiske antargat prastaavit parivartan kii ghoshnaa samachar-patron ke madhyam se karnaa or parivartan ek aadhikarik gajet main prakashit karwaanaa shaamil hota he
 Therefore, according to modern practice, her husband's name is added at the end, as do some Western women, who add their husband's name with a logo
 jo log namakaran kii dakshin bhartiya paddati ko nahin samaj pate, ve kabhi-kabhi galat tareeke se adyaksharon kaa vistaar karte hai
 For example, the name P
 Chidambaram is expanded to Palaniyappan Chidambaram, which is incorrect in the sense that the person's name is "palaniappan" and his family name is "chidambaram"
 vastav main, vyakti kaa naam keval “chidambaram” he or uske purv adyakshar “pi” joda gaya he
 Also, if the name Srishti Venkata is Sneh Phanindra, then it is given with three initials
 V
S
 Phanindra can be written
 aisi hi anya prasiddh galat vyakhyaaon main shatranj ke grand master ve
 anand ; cricketer, el
 shivaramkrishnan ; tathaa swatantraaa senaanee va rajaneta, si
 rajagopalaachari shaamil hai
 On the other hand, the North Indian media often mentions Dr
 Anbumani Ramadoss only as Dr
 Ramadoss, which is again incorrect because Ramadoss is his father's name, not his
 swatantra bharat ke prarambh main justise party or anya dravid dalon ne is bhram ko badhaane main bahut yogadan diya he
 For example, a person named Rajaram Iyer used to get benefits in schools, colleges, jobs etc
 due to being of the Iyer caste
 duusari ore, sambhav he ki pahachaane jane se bachane ke liye koi vyakti apni jati kaa naam ghoshit na kare
 "kisi vyakti ko keval apni jati kii ghoshnaa karne maatr se koi laabh yaa haani kyon praapt honi chaiye?" yah dravid vichaardhaara dwaara uthaaya gaya mukhya prashn tha
 For example, in a public office a person named Rajaram Mudaliar may not be treated the same way as a person named Rajaram Nadar
 iske alaava, bina kulanaam / jati ke naam vaala koi rajaraam logon ko bhram main daal degaa
 As a result, the father's name began to be included as an initial
 In some vulgar terms, it was referred to in some parts of Tamil Nadu
 "hamaara janm pita se hua he, jatiyon se nahin"
 itnaa sab-kuch kehane or hone ke baavjood bhi yah sthiti bani hui he ki tamilnadu main ek shaktishaalee jati-pratha or jatigat bhaavana maujuud he, lekin use keval naam ke dwaara ujagar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Many South Indian people also use a family name
 paariwarik naam tamilnadu main aam nahin hai, lekin shesh bharat main adhikansh log ek paariwarik naam kaa prayog karte hai
 Kannada names may include place names, lineage / title / caste names, father's names along with the person's name

 paaramparik rup se purna naam nimnlikhit teen main se kisi ek paddati kaa paalan karte hai: 1
 The family name is followed by the person's name and is usually followed by the caste name or title

 Sometimes the name / title of the caste is removed, e
g
, Canath Karunakaran
 In the case of women, the name / title of the caste, traditionally, was generally different, for example "amma" was used for "nair", "inambajanam" was used for "namboodiri", "variyasar" for "varayar", "nangyar" for "nambiar", "kunjamma" for "valiyathan / Unnithan / Kartha"

 aksar paariwarik naam ek se adhik bhaagon se milakar bana hoga, udaa

 Usually the family name is initialized, sometimes the person's name is also initialized and the caste name is never initialized
 It is completely voluntary

 In the Nair caste, initially the use of the mother's family name is also common

 2
 The family name is followed by the father's name followed by the person's name
 yah shesh jansankhya ke bich aam he
 For example, most traditional Christian names follow this pattern
 saamanytah paariwarik naam or pita ke naam ko adyakshrit kiya jaataa tha
 In the case of women, "amma" was often used
 Examples include KM Mani, KG George, VS Achuthanandan, KR Gowri Amma
 Many Iyer of Palakkad use an adapted form of this method, in which the name "gramam" was written instead of the family name
 udhaaharan: thirunelai narayanayar sheshan, jahaan thirunelai gaanv kaa naam he, narayanayar pita kaa naam or sheshan vyakti kaa naam he; yaa guuruvayur shankaranarayanan lalitha ko ji

 Title after the person's name
 This is particularly common among Syrian Christians in the central Travancore region, where kings or local rulers conferred titles on select families
 udaahranon main varges vaidyan, fr
 gevergees panikkar, chaako muthalali, avira tharakan, vaarki valikappan aadi shaamil hai
 4
 Father's name and initials taken as mother's name after the person's name
 This practice is now common, while both the mother and father's names are found with the person's name
 udaahranarth, el
 athira krishna
 yahaan mata ke naam ‘lila’ kaa ullekh adyakshar ke rup main miltaa he or pita kaa naam ‘krishna’ kulanaam ke rup main liya gaya he
 5
 Most of these traditional naming methods are no longer used
 saamanytah aajkal paariwarik naam shaamil nahin kiye jate 
 vyakti ke naam, uske baad pita ke naam athwa jati kaa naam likhnaa vartmaan main prachlit sabase aam paddati he
 It is also not uncommon to write the name of the original village along with the family name, especially in Southern Kerala, e
g
 Kavalam Narayan Panikkar, where Kavalam is a village in the Alappuzha district
 is baat par dhyaan diya janaa chaiye ki anek isai naam, jaise varges aremic / syrian mul ke hai
 Many people in the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala do not use a formal surname, although most of them may have a surname
 aisa isaliye he kyonki paaramparik rup se kulanaam unki jati kaa ullekh karata he or is baat ko sunishchit karne ke liye ki unke naam jati-nirpeksh hon, unke kulanaam puri tarah tyaag diye jate hai
 So in practice, people use either their father's name or initials instead of surnames
 jab adyaksharon kaa prayog kiya ja rahaa ho, to unhen vyakti ke naam ke pehle yaa baad main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 For example; G
 Venkatesan, Venkatesan Ji, or Venkatesan Govindarajan, all of these are different ways a person called Venkatesan, whose father's name is Govindarajan, can use to refer to himself
 malaysia main rahane vaale bhartiya mul ke adhikansh logon kaa paitruk mul dakshin bharat main he
 In Malaysia, the common form of naming for Indians is X, the son of y or X, the daughter of Y
 shabdaawalee ‘kaa putr’ malay bhashaa main aanak lelki he, or shabdaawalee 'kii putree' aanak perempuan he, 
 For example, the name of the Malaysian identity card and the name of Velugillai's son Murugan in the Malaysian passport would be written as MURUGAN a / l VELLUPILLAI
 uparokt udhaaharan kaa prayog karte huye, MURUGAN a / l VELLUPILLAI apane naam ko is prakaar bhi vyavasthit karegaa ki uske pita kaa naam uskaa adyakshar ban jaye fir uskaa naam uskaa kulanaam / antim naam prathit ho: ve

 However, the number of Malaysian Indians settling in Western countries is increasing and to avoid ambiguity, they have started using the father's name as their last name

 telegu logon ke paariwarik naamon ke pehle vyakti kaa naam likhaa jaataa he or aksar yah apane sankshipt rup main hota he

 gandhi ne dilli main apana pehla aamaran anshan shuru kiya tha jisamen sampradayik hinsa ko tatkaal samaapt karne or pakistan ko 50 karod rupee kaa bhugtan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 Gandhiji feared that instability and insecurity in Pakistan would increase his anger towards India and violence would spread on the border
 gandhi kii jid ko dekhte hue sarkaar ne is rakam kaa bhugtan kar diya lekin hindu sanghathanon ko laga ki gandhi ji musalamaanon ko khush karne ke liye chaal chal rahe hai
 The incident of the bomb blast was linked to this decision of Gandhi
 nathuram isse pehle bhi baapu ke hatya kii teen baar koshish kar chukaa tha, lekin asafal hone par vah apane dost narayan apte ke saath waapas bombay chalaa gaya
 Together they along with Dattatreya Parchure and Gangadhar Dandavate bought a pistol named Barreta

 It was only five months after the country was liberated that the news of differences between Pandit Nehru and Sardar Patel started coming in the media
 gandhi aisi khabaren saamne aane se behad dukhi the or ve iskaa jawaab dena chaahate the
 He even wanted him to ask Sardar Patel to resign so that Nehru would see the entire functioning of the government
 lekin aisa nahin ho sakaa
 On 30 January 1948, he called Patel for talks at four o'clock in the evening and after the prayer was over, asked him to discuss the issue
 lekin niyati ko yah manjuur nahin tha
 Patel along with his daughter Maniben reached Gandhi on time
 patel ke saath meeting ke baad prarthana ke liye jate samay gandhi godse kii goliyon kaa shikaar ho gayi
 Gandhi used to say that his life is in the hands of God and if he were to die then no one could save him
 unhone ek baar kaha tha-"jo azaadi ke bajaay suraksha chaahate hai unhen jeene kaa koi haq nahin he
 "though a watchman used to live at the gate of Birla Bhavan
 tatkaaleen grih mantri sardaar patel ne ehtiyaat ke taur par birla house par ek head consteble or chaar constablon kii tainaati ke aadesh diye the
 At the time of Gandhi's prayer, police used to be stationed in plain clothes in Birla Bhawan to keep an eye on every suspect
 haalanki police ne sochaa ki ehtiyaat ke taur par yadi prarthana sabha main hissaa lene ke liye aane vaale logon kii talaashi lekar unhen birla bhawan ke parisar main ghusane kii ijaajat di jaye to behatar rahegaa
 But Gandhiji did not like this idea of the police
 police ke diaiji level ke ek afasar ne bhi gandhi se is bare main baat kii or kaha ki unki jaan ko khatra ho saktaa he lekin gandhi nahin maane
 According to the FIR filed by Nandlal Mehta after Bapu's murder, the last word that came out of his mouth was 'hey Ram'
 lekin swatantrata senaanee or gandhi ke nijee sachiv ke taur par kaam kar chuke ve0 kalyanm kaa daawa he ki yah baat sach nahin he
 At the time of that incident, Kalyanam standing right behind Gandhi said that there was no question of any word coming out of Gandhi's mouth after being shot
 haalanki gandhi aksar kaha jarur karte the ki jab vah marenge to unke hothon par ram kaa naam hi hoga
 If he had been ill or lying in bed, 'ram' would have come out of his mouth
 gandhi kii hatya kii jaanch ke liye gathit ayog ne us din rashtrapita ke sabase kareeb rahe logon se poochtacha karne kii jahamat bhi nahin uthaayi
 Nevertheless, it became famous worldwide that the last word that came out of Gandhi's mouth was 'hey Ram'
 lekin ise kabhi sabit nahin kiya ja sakaa
 There is no information as to why he was taken back to Birla House instead of being taken to hospital despite being shot
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki mahatma gandhi ke ek paariwarik mitra ne unki asthiyaan lagbhag 62 saal tak gopneey jagah par rakhin jise 30 janvari 2010 ko durban ke samudr main pravaahit kiya gaya
 Faced with fears of misuse of its destructive power after making the world known to the nuclear potential, Albert Einstein was desperate to meet non-violence priest Mahatma Gandhi
 parantu unki yah ichha puri nahin ho saki

 He chose a new path of struggle to free the country from slavery which is humane and unique
 yah ek aisa maarg he jo puri duniya ke sabhy samaaj ko maanavtaa ke bare main sochane ko majaboor karata he
 He wrote that we should be happy that the fortune gifted us in his time as a man who will be a guide for generations to come

 "agar mujhe kisi pagal aadmi kii goli se bhi maranaa ho to mujhe muskaraate hue maranaa chaiye
 Only God's name should be on my heart and tongue
 or agar aisa kuch hota he to tum logon ko ansu kaa ek kataraa bhi nahin bahaanaa
 " – mohandas karamchand gandhi 28 janvari 1948 During his entire lifetime, Mahatma Gandhi wrote about 35 thousand letters
 in patron main baapu apane sahyogiyon, shishyon, mitron, sambandhiyon aadi ko unke chhadam naam se sambodhit karte the

 According to the Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi Volume-54, Mahatma Gandhi replied to Einstein's letter on 18 October 1931
 jawaab main unhone likhaa - "sundaram ke madhyam se mujhe aapkaa sundar patr mila
 i got satisfaction that the work i am doing is right in your eyes
 main ummid karata hoon ki bharat main mere ashram main aapse meri aamane saamne mulaakaat hogi

 Its member species are very diverse, but they all grow inside them by infecting the supracentric cells

 They cannot be grown outside cells
 vaakyapadiya, sanskrit vyakaran kaa ek prasiddh granth he
 It is also called Trikandi
 vaakyapadiya, vyakaran shrunkhlaa kaa mukhya darshanik granth he
 Its author is the author of Ethics, Mahaveekaran and Yogiraj Bhatrihari
 inke guru kaa naam vasuraat tha
 Some have placed Bhartrihari in the third, some in the fourth and sixth or seventh century
 vaakyapadiya main bhartruhari ne bhashaa kii prakruti or uskaa vahya jagat se sambandh par apane vichaar vyakt kiye hai
 This book is divided into three parts called "kanda"
 yah samast granth padya main likhaa gaya he
 The first is "brahmakand" which has 157 karyakas, the second is "syntax" which has 493 karikas and the third is famous as "medaland"
 iskaa pratham kand brahmakand he jisamen shabd kii prakruti kii vyakhya kii gayi he
 In this, the word is considered to be Brahm and the word is said to be the main means for attaining Brahm
 duusare kand main vaakya ke vishay main bhartruhari ne vibhinn mat rakhe hai
 In the third episode, topics of other philosophical customs, such as caste, matter, time etc
 are discussed
 isamen bhartruhari yah dikhaane kaa prayaas karte hai ki vividh mat, ek hi vastu ke alag-alag ayaamon ko prakashit karte hai
 Thus they are trying to integrate all philosophies with their grammar based philosophy
 mul main vyakaran shaastra ek prakaar se aagam shaastra he
 Its expression is from Maheshwar
 aagam ke anusaar shabd ke chaar swaroop hai - "para", "pashyanti", "madhyamaa" tathaa "vaikhari"
 Among them, "para" is Brahm
 isiilie vaakyapadiya kii pratham karika main hi shabdatatv ko anadi or anant tathaa akshar brahm kaha he
 In the same way, the origin and behavior of the world's substances from Brahm has been considered in a different way
 pratham cond main, shabdatatv ke darshanik rup kaa vichaar he, atev ise "brahmakand" naam diya gaya he or saadhaaran rup main iskaa vaachakatv siddh kiya gaya he
 In fact, it is an incoming scandal
 aagam kii drushti se likhaa gaya he
 Some useful and knowable things about this scandal are- us brahm kii prapti ke upaay tathaa swaroop ko maharishiyon ne "veda" kaha he
 Despite this one, many are known
 isiilie rik yajush, sam tathaa atharvan naam se chaar veda kahe jate hai
 Including 21 of the Rigveda, 100 of Yajurveda, 1000 of Samaveda and 9 of Atharva Veda, 1130 branches were performed
 aisa hone par bhi sabhi vedon tathaa unki shakhaon kaa ekmaatr pratipaadya vishay "karm" he
 It is to be remembered that the word or mantra in which the vowel in which the branch is recited is fruitful when pronounced in the same way
 vahi shabd usee rup main duusari shakha main padhe jane se is shabdoccharan kaa fal hoga anyathaa nahin, athwa anya koi fal degaa
 Without the proceeds, there can be no determination of duty and duty
 rishiyon main jo atindriya vastu ko dekhne kaa gyaan he vah bhi aagam hi ke dwaara praapt he 
 No real knowledge can be attained through logic, it is variable
 unche str ke rishiyon ke liye bhoot or bhavishya sabhi pratyaksh hai
 Due to self-illumination of knowledge, both the nature of the soul and the nature of known material etc
 are contained in it
 usee prakaar shabd main arth kaa swaroop or uskaa apana swaroop, donon kii pratiti hoti he
 Just as the red form associated with Jayapushu is eclipsed by the crystal, similarly the sound received from the sphota is eclipsed
 kisi kaa mat he ki jis prakaar indriyon kaa gun asanvedya hokar bhi vishyon ke gyaan kaa kaaran he, usee prakaar dhwani asanvedya hoti hui bhi shabd ke gyaan kaa kaaran hoti he
 The second view is that due to the "distance" defect, there is no knowledge of the nature of the explosion, only the sound is known
 teesraa mat he ki sphot kaa bhaan to hota he parantu doortv dosha ke kaaran asfoot rahata he, jaise dur hone ke kaaran kisi vastu kaa "pariman" spasht rup main bhaasith nahin hota
 Molecules have all kinds of powers, which is why there are functions of molecules in the form of distinction and connection
 ye anu chaaya, aatap, tamas tathaa shabd ke rup main parinat hote rahete hai
 These powers are motivated with great effort at the time of expression
 or jis prakaar badal banate hai usee prakaar shabd ke parmaanu kramash: ikatthe hokar sabhi kaary karte hai
 The names of these atoms are "word" or "word-word"
 is prakaar shabd ke aagmik swaroop kaa vivechan tathaa shabd hi se samast jagat kii sristi kaa nirupan brahmakand main he
 In the second scandal, "verse" is the sign or "sentence" is its vivid idea
 bhinn-bhinn maton kaa aalochan he
 In this same case, Bhartrihari has said - The words and meanings are two distinctions of the same divineness which do not remain separate
 rishiyon ko tatv kaa pratyaksh gyaan hota he kintu usase vyavhaar nahin chal saktaa
 Therefore, at the time of behavior, everyone should do those indescribable elements the way people behave
 "pratibha" ko sabhi pramanik maanate hai or isi ke bal se pakshiyon ke bhi vyavhaar kaa gyaan logon ko hota he 
 By mixing the seeds, sap of "lacquer", along with sowing the seeds, there is a difference in the color of the fruits of that seed and its fruits
 "shastrarth" kii prakriya keval agya logon ko samajhane ke liye he, na ki tatv ke pratipaadan ke liye
 Avidya is only thought through processes in the scriptures
 "avidya" ke upmardan ke pashchaat aagam ke vikalpon se rahit shastraprakriya prapanchashunya hone par "vidya" ke rup main prakat hoti he
 That is why it is said that truth is attained through the path of untruth, just as the teaching of the first scriptures to them while teaching children is only transcendental
 ityadi darshanik rup se vyakaran ke tatwon kaa vichaar 493 karikaon main duusare cond main he
 In the third scandal, "padvichara" is processed
 arth dwaara padon kii pariksha hoti he
 In the opinion of justice-vaishyasik, it is not common in the sky, but according to the syntactic, there is caste in the sky due to main or secondary discrimination
 "gyaan" swaprakash he
 Both the subject and its advisory are different
 is cond main 13 khand hai jinamein 450 se adhik karikaon main darshanik rup se vyakaran ke padaarthon kaa vishad vichaar kiya gaya he
 This scandal is fragmented
 vaakyapadiya par bhutiraj ke putr helaraj ne bahut sundar tathaa vistrut tikaa likhi he
 Even in modern times, some scholars have written commentaries, but due to their not being in sight, they do not get real knowledge of the phrase
 isaki bahut si karikas nasht hui maaloom hoti hai
 Yudhishthira Mimansak and Sadhuram have given some thoughts on the lost karmis

 This list focuses on Nokia's modern phones and mobile products
 nokia anya vidhut upkaran jaise kii televijan vagrah bhi banaata he
 Boldface in the phone means that the phone is based on the Symbian operating system, which the smartphone
 s = Status, where p indicates under production, and d is discontinued
 Like the 1000 series, the 2000 series are entry-level phones
 However, the 2000 series generally contain more advanced features than the 1000 series; many new 2000 series phones feature color screens and some feature cameras and / or Bluetooth
 The 2000 series slot between the 1000 and 3000 series phones in terms of features
 The Nokia 3000 series are mostly mid-range phones targeted towards the youth market
 Some of the models in this series are targeted towards young male users, in contrast with the more unisex business-oriented 6000 series and the more feminine fashion-oriented 7000 series
 Feature wise, the 3000 series slot between the 2000 and 6000 series
 The nokia 5000 series are similar in features to the 3000 series, but often contain more features towards active individuals
 Many of the 5000 series phones feature a rugged construction or contain extra features for music playback
 The 5210 features rubber xpress-on shells, WAP over CSD and a built in thermometer
 The thermometer is actually the internal temperature of the phone's battery, this feature is also present on other phones that have "netmonitor" enabled
 The 5210 is nicknamed a "builder's phone" because of its rubber splash / impact proof casing
 Its successor is the 5100 and after that, the 5140 and 5140i
 The 5510 was nokia's first phone with a built in MP3 player, and it had 64 megabytes of memory for storing mp3s
 It also had a full QWERTY keyboard and an 84 x 48 monocrome display
 This phone did not sell very well even though it was advertised on television, possibly because it was too expensive and too big
 Its replacement is the nokia 3300
 The Nokia 6000 series is Nokia's largest family of phones
 It consists mostly of mid-range to high-end phones containing a high amount of features
 The 6000 series is notable for their conservative, unisex designs, which make them popular among business users
 nokia 6136 UMA is the first mobile phone to include Unlicenced Mobile Access
 nokia 6131 NFC is the first mobile phone to include Near Field Communication
 The Nokia 7000 series is a family of Nokia phones with two uses
 Most phones in the 7000 series are targeted towards fashion-conscious users, particularly towards women
 Some phones in this family also test new features
 The 7000 series are considered to be a more consumer-oriented family of phones when contrasted to the business-oriented 6000 series
 The 7110 was the first nokia phone with a WAP browser
 WAP was significantly hyped up during the 1998-2000 Internet boom
 However WAP did not meet these expectations and uptake was limited
 Another industry first was the flap, which slid from beneath the phone with a push from the release button
 Unfortunately the cover was not too durable
 The 7110 was also the only phone to feature a navi-roller key
 The 7250i was a slightly improved version of the Nokia 7250
 It includes XHTML and OMA Forward lock digital rights management
 The phone has the exact same design as the 7250
 This phone is far more popular than the 7250 and has been made available on pre-paid packages and therefore it is very popular amongst youths in the UK and other European countries
 The 7650 was the first Series 60 smartphone of nokia
 It was quite basic compared to new smartphones, it did not have MMC slot, but it had a camera
 The 7610 was nokia's first smartphone featuring a megapixel camera, and is targeted towards the fashion conscious individual
 End-users can also use the 7610 with nokia Lifeblog
 Other pre-installed applications include the Opera and Kodak Photo Sharing
 It is notable for its looks, having opposite corners rounded off
 It comes with a 64 MB Reduced Size MMC
 The main CPU is an ARM compatible chip running at 123 mhz
 The 7710's 640 x 320 screen is a touch screen
 This series is characterized by ergonomics and attractiveness
 The internals of the phone are similar to those in different series and so on that level offer nothing particularly different, however the physical handset itself offers a level of functionality which appeals to users who focus on ergonomics
 The front slide keypad covers offered a pseudo-flip that at the time nokia were unwilling to make
 Materials used increased the cost and hence exclusivity of these handsets
 The only exception to the rule is the 82xx, 8310 which were very small and light handsets
 The newest Communicator, the E90 Communicator, is an Eseries phone
 Vertu is an independent company, owned by Nokia, that manufactures exclusively hand crafted high-end mobile phones
 Materials used include platinum, 18 carat white gold, 18 carat yellow gold, stainless steel, ruby keypad bearings, and a sapphire crystal display for the 'signature' and leather, 316L Surgical stainless steel and Liquidmetal for the 'ascent'
 Nokia is working towards the future of phones and mobile communication devices with their new concept phone, the Nokia "scentsory"
 This new mobile device uses the sense of smell, sight, hearing, and touch to create a multiscensory environment for the caller
 Scentsory would be able to detect, send, and emit smells, as well as radiate colors, lighting, and temperature from the environment of the caller
 Dual screens can be used for personal video messaging as well as watching videos
 Scentsory also includes features such as an LED touchpad, hidden camera, and folding "origami" design, revolutionizing not only features previously foreign to the phone, but introducing a new physical design to the phone

 This tomb was completely different from the tomb Bagh e Babur in Kabul of Humayun's father Babur, built by the Mughals earlier
 babar ke saath hi samraaton ko baag main bane makbaron main dafn karne kii parampara aarambh hui thi
 This building, based on the mausoleum built in Samarkand of his ancestor Timur Lang, became the inspiration for the tombs of Mughal architecture going forward in India
 ye sthapaty apane charam par tajmahal ke saath pahunchaa
 The site was chosen for the mausoleum on the banks of the Yamuna river because of its proximity to Hazrat Nizamuddin
