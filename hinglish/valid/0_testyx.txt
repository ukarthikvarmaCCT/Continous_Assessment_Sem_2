 prashasnic rup se yah purv java praant kaa bhaag he
 Indian percussion, two drums of leather pakhaawaj, mrudang, khol, dholak, nagaada, bongo Tabla is a rhythm used in Indian music which is very popular mainly in South Asian countries
 yah lakdi ke do urdhvamukhi, belanaakaar, chamada madhe munh vaale hisson ke rup main hota he, jinhen rakh kar bajaaye jane kii parampara ke anusaar "daayan" or "bayen" kehete hai
 This rhythm is very important in Hindustani classical music and has been used almost inevitably in classical and sub-classical singing since the eighteenth century
 iske atirikt sugam sangeet or hindi cinema main bhi iskaa prayog pramukhataa se hua he
 This Baja is practiced in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka
 pehle yah gayan-vaadan-nrity ityadi main taal dene ke liye sahyogi vaadya ke rup main hi bajaay jaataa tha, parantu baad main kai tabalaa vaadakon ne ise ekal vaadan kaa madhyam banaaya or kaaphi prasiddhi bhi arjeet kii
 The origin of the name Tabla is traced to the word "tabl" of arabic-persian origin
 haalaanki, is vaadya kii vaastavik utpatti vivaadit he - jahaan kuch vidvan ise ek pracheen bhartiya parampara main hi urdhvak aalingyak vaadyon kaa viksit rup maanate hai vahiin kuch isaki utpatti baad main pakhaawaj se nirmit maanate hai or kuch log isaki utpatti kaa sthaan pachhimi asia bhi bataate hai
 The history of the tabla is accurately known and there are many subscriptions about its origin
 isaki utpatti ke sambandh main varnit vichaaron ko do samoohon main baanta ja saktaa he: During colonial rule, the hypothesis was very forcefully introduced that the tabla originated from a couple drums plying with Muslim armies; The origin of this establishment is based on the Arabic word "tabl" which means "drum"
 babar dwaara sena ke saath aise drum lekar chalane ko udhaaharan ke rup main prastut kiya jaataa he, haalaanki turk senaaon ke saath chalane vaale ye vaadyayantra table se koi samanta nahin rakhte balki "nakkaara" se samanta rakhte hai
 According to the second establishment, in the time of Alauddin Khilji, Amir Khusrau is said to have cut the "awaaz Baja" into a tabla
 haalaanki, yah bhi sambhav nahin lagata kyonki us samay ke koi bhi chitra is tarah ke kisi vaadya yantra kaa nirupan nahin karte
 Muslim historians have also not mentioned any such instrument in their descriptions
 udhaaharan ke liye, abul faiji ne in-e-akabari main tatkaaleen vaadyayantron kii lambii suchi ginai he, lekin isamen table kaa zikr nahin he
 Another third opinion is that Amir Khusro, a disciple of Delhi-based noted singer Sadrang and son of the famous Pakhawaj player Rahman Khan, invented tabla in 1738 AD from Pakhawaj
 isse pehle khyaal gayan main bhi pakhaawaj se sangat kii jaati thi
 This theory has potential because the miniature artifacts of the time have evidence of a musical instrument similar to the tabla
 haalaanki, isse yah prathit hota he kii is vaadyayantra kii utpatti bhartiya upmahadeep ke muslim samudaayon main dilli ke aasapaas hui na ki yah arab deshon se aaayaatit vaadyayantra he
 Musicologists such as Neil Sorrel and Pandit Ram Narayan do not see much truth in the legend of the pakhawaj cutting and making tabla
 bhartiya utpatti ke siddhant ko maanane vaale table kaa mul bharat main maanate hai or yah kehete hai ki muslim kaal main isane maatr arabi naam grahan kar liya
 Bharata Muni, the pioneer of Indian Natyashastra, is said to describe the up-temporal musical instruments
 aise hi, haath main lekar bajaaye jane vaale "pushkar" naamak talwadyon se table kii utpatti bataayi jaati he
 Evidence of the "pushkar" instrument is found in the sixth-seventh century temple engravings, especially in the Mukteshwar and Bhubaneswar temples
 in kalakritiyon main vadak kalakaar do yaa teen alag-alag rakhe talwadyon ko saamne rakh kar baithe dikhaae gaye hai or unke haathon or ungliyon ke nirupan se ve inhen bajaate hue prathit hote hai
 However, these representations do not show that these instruments are made from the same material and are as tanned as modern times
 tabalaa aaj jin padaarthon se or jis rup main banaaya jaataa he, aise vaadyayantron ke nirmaan ke likhit pramaan sanskrit granthon main uplabdh hai
 "tabla" - the oldest information related to the construction of instruments is found in Sanskrit Natya Shastra
 in talwadyon ko bajaane se sambandhit vivaran bhi naatyashaastra main milti he
 At the same time, the South Indian treatise, for example, Shilappadikaram, whose composition is believed to be of the first century AD, gives details of about thirty tala vadis, some of which are tightened by ropes and others, but does not contain an instrument called "tabla"
 is
 taal or talwadyon kaa varnan vaidic sahitya se hi milanaa shuru ho jaataa he
 With two or three limbs, hanging with cords, the hand-played instrument "pushkar" has evidence of being in the fifth century which were counted in other rhythms with mridang, however, they were not called tabla
 used to go
 paanchavin sadi se purv kii ajanta gufaaon ke bhitti-chitra jameen par rakh kar bajaaye jane vaale urdhvamukhi drumon kaa nirupan karte hai
 a similar representation of artists playing the rhythm of the sit is found in the stone sculptures of Ellora, and also from other places
 pehali sadi ke chini-tibeti yatriyon dwaara bhi bharat main chote aakaar ke urdhvamukhi drumon kaa prachlan hone kaa vivaran praapt hota he 
 Jain and Buddhist texts such as Samvayasutra, Lalitvistara and Sutralankara etc
 also find details of this rhythm called Pushkar
 kai hindu or jain mandir, jaise kii rajasthan ke jaipur sthit eklingaji mandir, table jaise aakaar ke vaadya bajaate hue vyakti kaa prastar murtiyon main nirupan karte hai
 In the south, there is evidence of small rhythms like IS even during the time of Yadav rule when Sarangadeva was composing the music Ratnakar
 haalia bimbashastreey daawey jinamein table ko 1799 ke aasapaas kaa mana gaya he ab mahatvaheen ho chuki hai or bhaaje gufaaon se praapt chitra pracheen bharat main is tarah ke vaadya kaa prayog pramanit karte hai
 Evidence of upward-facing instruments on the ground has been obtained from several Hindu temples dating back to around 500 BCE
 dakshin bharat main istarah ke vaadyon ke maujuud hone ke pramaan ke rup main hoyasaleshwar mandir, karnatakam kaa udhaaharan liya ja saktaa he jisamen ek nakkashi main nrity samaaroh main ek stri table jaise vaadya bajaati dikhaai gayi he
 The tabla differs from the mridang and pakhavaj on the basis of the art of playing
 isamen haath kii ungaliyon kii kalatmak gati kaa mahatv adhik he
 At the same time, pakhawaj and mridang are played at the speed of the claw as they are hit horizontally and thus complexity in their speech is not as much as in the tabla
 atah dhvanishastreey or vaadan kala aadhaarit adhyayanon main table kii samanta teenon vaadyon ke saath sthapit kii ja sakati he; pakhaawaj kii tarah kaa "daayan", nakkaare kii tarah aakaar vaala "bayen", dholak kii tarah gamak vaala prayog, teenon praapt hote hai
 The "tabla" has two parts, that is, it consists of two drums whose size and shape are somewhat different from each other
 takneekee taur par, ek sidhe haath vaale vadak dwaara, daahine haath se bajaay jane vaala ang hi tabalaa kehalaata he
 In common language, it is called right or right
 yah lagbhag 15 centimetre vyas vaala or 25 centimetre oonchaai vaala hota he
 The left side is also called Dagga, Duggi or Dhama according to the region
 puraane praapt chitron main daahine or baayen ang kaa aakaar lagbhag samaan paaya gaya he or kabhi kabhi baayen kaa aakar chota bhi
 However, now the size of the left is much larger than that of the tabla
 dahinaa yaa tabalaa bahudhaa lakdi kaa bana hota he jabaki bayen mitti kaa bhi hota he athwa donon hi pital yaa phool ke bhi bane ho sakate hai
 The left is a wide-mouthed, leather-plated drum with a size of about 20 cm in diameter and 25 cm in height
 daahine main doriyon ke bich lakdi ke chote aade belan belan lage hote hai, jinpar hathaudi se chot kar doriyon ke kasaav ko badla ja saktaa he
 This action is called melody
 gayan-vaadan ke dauraan raag ke mukhya swar "sa" ke saath table kii dhwani kii tikshnata kaa milan kiya jaataa he, jise table ko "shadj" par milaanaa kehete hai
 As with the sitar, as the string is instrumental and of high sharpness, the tabla is also mixed on the "fifth"
 baayen ko saamanytah, table kii tulana main nichle swaron "mandra pancham" par sur main rakhaa jaataa he
 Artists can also make slight changes to the left notes by applying pressure on the back of their palm
 in donon angon ke aakaar main vishmata ke kaaran tikhe or chanchal bol - ta, tin, naa ityadi daahine par bajaaye jate hai or baayen kaa aakaar bada hone ke kaaran gambhir aawaaj vaale naad dhe, dhig ityadi baayen par bajte hai
 That's why "left" is used as a "base drum"
 tabalon ke chamada madhe mukh par bhi teen hisse hote hai: The part that forms a black rash in the middle of each part of the tabla is called "ink"
 yah mukhya rup se chaaval yaa gehun ke mand main kai prakaar kii chije mila kar banaaya gaya ek lep hota he jo suukh kar kadaa ho jane ke baad table ke chamade kii swaabhaavik dhawani kaa parishkar karke ise ek khanakdaar awaz pradaan karata he
 Proper use of ink during the tabla manufacturing process is a skill and the quality of this instrument is largely dependent on the efficiency of ink implantation
 kuch vadak, duggi par siyaahi ke bajaay, goondhe gaye aate ko chipka kar sukha lete hai, haalaanki yah prakriya har baar kerani padati he or tabalaa vaadan ke baad ise khurch kar hataa diya jaataa he
 In Punjab it is still in vogue and such "left" is called "dhama"
 table ke bolon ko "shabd", "akshar" yaa "varna" bhi kehete hai
 These lyrics have not been traditionally written but have been taught in oral form in the guru-shishya tradition
 isiilie inke naamon main kuch vividhta dekhne ko milti he
 There is a difference of speech in the playing of different area and house
 ek hi bol ko bajaane ke kai tareekon kaa prachlan bhi miltaa he
 According to one description, the original tabla numbers are fifteen of which eleven are played on the right and four on the left
 neeche david kartney likhit "fundamentals of tabalaa" or baalkrishna garg likhit bolon kaa ek sankshipt or samanyikrut vivaran prastut kiya gaya he: There are a total of six houses of tabla playing: dilli gharaane ke pravartak ustad sudhaar khaan the or punjab gharaane ke alaava baaki ke chaar anya gharaane bhi dilli gharaane kaa hi vistaar maane jate hai

 These are often not used in a 'linear state'
 Switching times range from tens of nanoseconds to a few hundred microseconds, depending on the device
 MOSFET drain source resistances increase as more current flows through the device
 As frequencies increase the losses increase as well, making bjts more attractive
 Power mosfets can be paralleled in order to increase switching current and therefore overall switching power
 Nominal voltages for MOSFET switching devices range from a few volts to a little over 1000 V, with currents up to about 100 a or so
 Newer devices may have higher operational characteristics
 MOSFET devices are not bi-directional, nor are they reverse voltage blocking
 An example of this new device from ABB shows how this device improves on GTO technology for switching high voltage and high current in power electronics applications
 According to ABB, the IGCT devices are capable of switching in excess of 5000 VAC and 5000 a at very high frequencies, something not possible to do efficiently with GTO devices

 a long time ago, a moneylender had seven sons and a sister, Karva
 sabhi saaton bhai apni bahan se bahut pyaar karte the
 Even they used to feed him first and then eat themselves
 ek baar unki bahan sasuraal se maayke ai hui thi
 In the evening, when his brother came home after closing his business, he saw that his sister was very distraught
 sabhi bhai khaanaa khaane baithe or apni bahan se bhi khaane kaa aagrah karne lage, lekin bahan ne bataaya ki uskaa aaj karvaa chouth kaa nirjal vrath he or vah khaanaa sirf chandramaa ko dekhakar use arghya dekar hi kha sakati he
 Since the moon has not yet come out, she has become distraught with hunger and thirst
 sabase chote bhai ko apni bahan kii haalat dekhi nahin jaati or vah dur pipal ke ped par ek deepak jalaakar chalani kii oot main rakh detaa he
 Looking at it from a distance, it seems as if the moon of Chaturthi is rising
 iske baad bhai apni bahan ko bataata he ki chaand nikal aayaa he, tum use arghya dene ke baad bhojan kar sakati ho
 Sister happily climbs the stairs and sees the moon, offers her an arrogance and sits down to eat
 vah pehla tukdaa munh main daalati he to use cheenk aa jaati he
 When the second piece is inserted, hair comes out in it and as soon as it tries to put the third piece in the mouth, she gets the news of her husband's death
 vah baukhala jaati he
 Her sister-in-law informs her of the truth as to why this happened to her
 karvaa chouth kaa vrath galat tareeke se tuutane ke kaaran devtaa usase naaraaz ho gaye hai or unhone aisa kiya he
 After getting to know the truth, Karva decides that she will not allow her husband to be cremated and will resurrect her by her persistence
 vah puure ek saal tak apane pati ke shav ke paas baithi rahati he
 Looks after him uske upar ugane vaali sooinuma ghaas ko vah ekatrit karti jaati he
 After a year, the day of Karva Chauth comes again
 uski sabhi bhabhiyaan karvaa chouth kaa vrath rakhti hai
 When sisters-in-law come to seek her blessings, she urges each sister-in-law to 'take Yama Sui, give it to me, make me your own suhagin', but each time the sister-in-law tells her to ask the next sister-in-law
 is
 is prakaar jab chathe number kii bhabhi aati he to karvaa usase bhi yahi baat doharaati he
 This sister-in-law tells her that since her fast was broken because of the youngest brother, her wife only has the power to resurrect your husband, so when she comes, you can hold her until she comes to your husband
 Do not leave it alive, do not leave it
 aisa kah ke vah chali jaati he
 At the end comes the younger sister-in-law
 karvaa unase bhi suhaagin banane kaa aagrah karti he, lekin vah taalamatoli karne lagati he
 Seeing this, she is caught by him and asks him to bring his son alive
 bhabhi usase chhudaane ke liye nochati he, khasotati he, lekin karvaa nahin chhodti he
 Finally, seeing her austerity, the sister-in-law exhales and rips her little finger and puts the nectar out of it in her husband's mouth
 karvaa kaa pati turant shriganesh-shriganesh kahata hua uth baithta he
 In this way, Karva gets her honeymoon back through her younger sister-in-law
 he shri ganesh maan gauri jis prakaar karvaa ko chir suhagan kaa vardaan aapse mila he, vaisaa hi sab suhaaginon ko mili
 The essence of this story is that the married daughter of Shakaprasthapur Vedadharma Brahmin, Veeravati, observed the fast of Karva Chauth
 niyamanusaar use chandroday ke baad bhojan karnaa tha, parantu usase bhukh nahin sahi gai or vah vyakul ho uthi
 The distraction of her sister from her brothers was not seen and she spread a beautiful light of fireworks under the cover of Peepal and showed the moon and made Veeravati a meal
 parinaam yah hua ki uskaa pati tatkaal adrishy ho gaya
 The impatient Veeravati fasted each Chaturthi for twelve months and her husband was recaptured by her penance on the day of Karva Chauth
 ek samay kii baat he ki ek karvaa naam kii pativrata stri apane pati ke saath nadi ke kinare ke gaanv main rahati thi
 One day her husband went to bathe in the river
 snaan karte samay vahaan ek magar ne uskaa pair pakad liya
 The man started calling his wife by saying Karva Karva Karva Karva
 uski aawaaj sunakar uski patni karvaa bhaagi chali ai or aakar magar ko kachche dhaage se band diya
 Tied the manger but reached Yamraj and started saying to Yamraj - o God! But my husband has caught my leg
 us magar ko pair pakadaney ke aparaadh main aap apane bal se narak main le jaao
 Yamraj said - yet the age of the manger is left, so i cannot kill him
 is par karvaa boli, agar aap aisa nahin karoge to main aap ko shraap dekar nasht kar duungi
 Hearing this, Yamaraja got scared and came with that husbandry Karva and sent Magar to Yampuri and gave longevity to Karva's husband
 he karvaa mata! jaise tumne apane pati kii raksha kii, vaise sabake patiyon kii raksha karnaa

 tab shankaraji ne mata parvati ko karvaa chouth kaa vrath batalaaya

 prachinkaal main ek brahman tha
 He had four boys and one quality girl
 ek baar ladki maayke main thi, tab karvaa chouth kaa vrath padaa
 He performed the fast methodically
 puure din nirjala rahi
 Nothing was eaten or drank, but all four of his brothers were worried that the sister would be thirsty, hungry, but the sister would take water only after the moonrise
 bhaaiyon se na rahaa gaya, unhone shaam hote hi bahan ko banaavati chandroday dikhaa diya
 a brother climbed a peepal tree with a sieve and lit a lamp and produced light from the sieve
 tabhi duusare bhai ne neeche se bahan ko aawaaj di- dekho bahan, chandramaa nikal aayaa he, pujan kar bhojan grahan karo
 Sister took food
 bhojan grahan karte hi uske pati kii mrityu ho gai
 Now she started to mourn, when Rani Indrani was leaving from there
 unase uskaa dukh na dekha gaya
 The Brahmin girl grabbed his leg and asked the reason for his grief, then Indrani said - You broke the fast of Karva Chauth without seeing the moon, so got this trouble
 ab tu varsh bhar kii chouth kaa vrath niyampurvak karnaa to tera pati jivit ho jayega
 She fasted according to Indrani's saying, then she again got lucky
 isliye prayek stri ko apane pati kii dderghaayu ke liye yah vrath karnaa chahie
 Draupadi did this fast and Arjuna returned back after receiving the desired fruit

 Warm Saturn cyclones such as tropical cyclones, mesocyclones, and polar subsidence lie within the small mesoscale
 ant: katibandheey chakravaat madhyavarti aakaar ke hote hai
 These cyclones have also been seen on other planets outside the Earth, such as Mars and Varuna
 cychlozenisis, chakravaat gathan or utkatataa kii prakriya ke bare main bataate he
 Cyclonic extratropical cyclones form waves at temperatures with large latitudes known as baroclinic regions
 yahi kshetra sankuchit hokar jab chakravaateey parisancharan main band hote he yaa ugr rup dhaaran karte hai tab vaataavaran main badalte hai
 Later these cyclones form as cold centers
 ek chakravaat kaa path 2 se 6 din ke chakra main dhruviya yaa ushn katibandheey kshetron main pravaahit hota rahata he
 Weather separates two parts of winds with different density and is most prominent in the seasonal event cycle
 hawa ke ansh taapmaana yaa ardrata main alag ho sakate he
 Strong cold winds usually appear in severe weather as narrow strips of storms, sometimes as strong lines and sometimes as dry lines

 The tropical cyclone fraction describes the process of development of tropical cyclones
 ushnkaribandheey chakravaat avyakt garmi sarthak aandhiyon kii avyakt garmi ke kaaran sanchalit hoti hai or garm mul kii hoti he
 Cyclones can change between the right tropical, extra-tropical and tropical phases, under the right conditions
 bhoomi ke upar garm kor chakravaat missosexlones kaa rup dhaaran karte he or tufaan kaa gathan bandhan bhi kar sakate hai
 Missoclones can also create watercourses, but mostly develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear
 sabhi chakravaaton kii kuch samaan sanrachanaatmak visheshtaayen hai
 For example, in areas of low pressure, their center is located in the region of the lowest atmospheric pressure and is known as the core of a mature tropical cyclone
 centre ke paas, dhaar shakti dabaav or coreolis bal ko ek santulit anupaat main hone chaiye anyathaa dabaav main parivartan se chakravaat kaa patan ho saktaa he
 The Coriolis effect causes the airflow around a large cyclone to rotate in the clockwise direction in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere
 sexogenesis, vayumandal main viksit chakravaateey sanchalan ke majboot hone se banataa he
 Cyclogenesis is a novel term for many different processes, which can result in the development of a cyclone
 yah vibhinn paimaane par ho saktaa he
 From micro scale to brief scale
 Extra-tropical cyclones develop as waves in the front of the season before being transformed into cold-weather cyclones
 ushnkaribandheey chakravaaton avyakt garmi mahatvapurn aandhi gatividhi se sanchalit hone ke kaaran hai or garm mul kii hoti he
 Mesocyclones are formed due to warm cyclones located on land and can also cause storm formation
 jalstambh masosaclons se bhi ban sakate he, par ve aksar ucch asthirataa or kam urdhwadhar hawa katarani ke vaataavaran se viksit hote he
 Cyclogenesis is the opposite of cyclosis, in that it has an opposite cyclonic conformer that constitutes a high pressure field — called ntsyclogenesis
 sataha nimna banane ke anek tareeke he
 Topography can force a low-pressure surface on a north-south mountain in the east to become a low-level but high-pressure system

 This upheaval becomes like a wave ahead and remains low at the summit
 paribhaashik rup main yah nimna chakravaat hi banegaa 
yah ghurni pravaah apni anugami ke madhyam se kam dhruviya hawa ko thande agrant se bumadhya rekhiy vrutt main or pashchimi garm hawa ko nichle dhruviya vrutt se garm agrant main dhakka detaa he
 Usually the cold front moves faster than the hot front and combines with the higher density hawrasi that are ahead of the cyclone, and the higher denser hawrashi that is behind the cyclone generates a wider hot area
 
 is samay ek band raashi ban jaati he jo garm hawa ko upar dhakelte hue ek garm gart banaata he jise troval kehete he
 Tropical cyclogenesis is a technical term used to develop and strengthen a tropical storm located in the atmosphere
 vah prakriya jiske jariye ushnkaribandheey sexogenesis ghatit hota he, vah madhya akshansh sexogenesis ghatane se alag hota hai
 The tropical cyclonic fraction is helpful in developing a warm-weather cyclone that is formed due to the favorable critical environment
 ushnkaribandheey sexlogenesis kii chah mukhya aavashyaktaayen hai : paryaapt garm samudri sataha kaa taapmaana, vayumandaleey asthirataa, nimna se madhya str vaale troposphior main ucch ardrata, aavashyak coreolis bal, ek purv astitv praapt nimna str yaa uthal puthal or kam urdhwadhar katarti hawa 
 vishvabhar main salaana, ushnkati bandheey tufaanon main se ausatan 86 ushnkaribandheey tufaanon main badal jate he
 47 of these become storm / strong thunderstorms and 20 deep tropical cyclones

 a storm's convective subdraft picks up this shear wind in a circular orientation from one edge to the top, causing Sarah's entire subduction to rotate as a vertical column
 mesosainchlones saamaanya rup se apekshaakrit sthaniyakrut hai: ve sankshipt paimaane or sookshm paimaane ke bich sthit hote he
 Radar imagery is used to identify these features
 tufaan kaa centre aamtaur par shant hota he or ek jagah par sthit hota he
 There are six main types of cyclones: polar cyclones, polar low, extra-tropical cyclones, inter-tropical cyclones, tropical cyclones and mesocyclones
 ek dhruviya kam chote paimaane par, kam samay tak jivit kam dabaav pranali he jo donon uttari or dakshini golardh ke mukhya dhruviya agrant ke saamne mahaasaagar kshetron par paayi jaati he
 This system is usually less visible on the parallel scale and cannot survive more than one to two days
 ve bade varg ke messoscale mausam pranali kaa hissaa he
 Polar lows are harder to detect than traditional weather reports and are a threat to high latitude processes, such as shipping, gas, and oil platforms
 dhruviya kam kaa ullekh anya shabdon se bhi kiya jaataa he, jaise ki dhruviya messoscal bhavar, arctic toofaan, arctic kam or thand hawa kaa dabaav 
aamtaur par yah shabd adhik joardaar pranaaliyon ke liye arakshit kiya gaya he jaha kam se kam 17 meter kii nikat-sataha kii hawaaen he
 1 ek attirikt ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ek sankshipt paimaane par kam dabaav vaali mausam pranali he jinke na to ushnkaribandheey or na hi koi dhruviya visheshtaayen hai, jo taapmaana or him bindu main agrant or samaanaantar dhaal main judy hui hoti he, ise vaise "baroclinics kshetra " kaha jaataa he
 The term 'extra-tropical' refers to the fact that such cyclones occur outside the planet's tropics, between the middle latitudes
 in pranaaliyon main unke kshetreey gathan yaa uttar ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ke kaaran 'madhya akshansh chakravaat' ke rup main suchit kiya jaataa he, jahaan attirikt ushnkaribandheey sankraman hota he or aksar mausam kaa purv anumaan lagane waalon or aam janata ke dwaara 'kam' yaa 'kam dabaav' varnit hota hai
 These are everyday events that, along with opposing cyclones, make up the majority of the Earth's climate
 haalanki atirikt ushnkaribandheey chakravaaton ko lagbhag hameshaa baroclinics kaha jaataa he, kyonki ye pashchimi hawa ke taapmaana or himbindu dhaar ke kshetron ke saath rahete he or kabhi kabhi ye barotropic bhi ban jaataa he jab chakravaat ke paas kaa taapmaana vitaran trigya ke saath ek samaan ho jaataa he
 An extra-tropical cyclone converts into a subclassic storm and from there into an inter-tropical cyclone if it remains above warm water and develops its original heat into central convection
 ek ant: ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ek mausam pranali he jiske kuch lakshan ushnkaribandheey chakravaat or kuch atirikt ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ke hote hai
 These can form between the equator and the 50th parallel
 1950 ke dashak se hi antariksh vigyaan shastriyon ko yah samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha ki ise ve ushnkaribandheey chakravaat kahen yaa adhik ushn katibandheey chakravaat kahen 
 isiilie inhen ve ushnkaribandheey samaan or arddh ushnkaribandheey kehete the jo sankar chakravaat bhi kahe jate the 1972 tak main rashtriya harrican centre ne ise sarkari taur par is chakravaat varg ko manyata di
 From 2002 onwards, tropical tropical cyclones began to receive names from the Atlantic Basin from the official tropical cyclone list
 unke paas vyapak hawa pratimaan he, jo adhiktam hawa ko tham saktaa he jo ushnkaribandheey chakravaaton ke mukaable centre se dur sthit hote he or jo kamjor se lekar madhya str tak ke taapmaana tak paaya jaataa he
 Because they are formed by more tropical cyclones whose temperatures are cooler than other cuttings, the ocean surface temperature used for their formation is three degrees Celsius, or five degrees Fahrenheit lower than the tropical cyclone threshold, Happens around 23 ° C
 isse yah pataa chalata he ki antah ushn katibandheey chakravaat paramparaagat seemaa ke baahar tufaani mausam main banate hai
 Although inter-tropical storms rarely have the pressure of stormy winds, they can be tropical in nature if their elements are heated
 ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ek tufaani pranali he, jo ek kam dabaav centre he or garajadaar toofaan, tej hawaaen or zyada varsha detaa he
 a tropical cyclone is formed when heat is released from moist air, resulting in the release of vapor contained in moist air
 ye alag garmi ghatakon dwaara banati he or anya chakravaateey tufaano, jaise nor'isters, europea aandhiya, dhruviya kam, tufaani pranalia kehalaati he
 The term 'tropical' refers to both geologic forms, which are found exclusively in the tropical regions of the globe, and sea breeze is formed in tropical air clusters
 'chakravaat' shabd prakruti se tufaani chakravaat ko suchit karata he, jo uttari golarddh main uttaravarat or dakshini golarddh main dakshinavart ghoomte he
 Tropical cyclones are also known by other names, depending on location and power, such as hurricanes, hurricanes, tropical storms, cyclonic storms, tropical pressures, or cyclones only
} In general, a tropical cyclone is called a hurricane in the Atlantic basin and the Pacific Ocean

 haalanki ushnkaribandheey chakravaat atyant shaktishaalee hawaaon or moosaldhar barish kaa utpaadan kar sakate hai, ve ucch tarangon or vinaashkari tufaan kaa utpaadan karne main bhi sakasham hai
 They develop on large bodies of hot water and their strength is reduced by moving over the ground
 isi kaaran ushnkaribandheey tufaan se tateey kshetron ko kaaphi nuksaan ho saktaa he, jabaki antardeshiy kshetra inase apekshaakrit surakshit rahete hai
 Heavy rains, however, create flooding conditions in inland areas and storm waves create widespread coastal flooding conditions over the coastline
 yadhyapi maanav aabaadi par unke prabhaav vinaashkari ho sakate he, ushnkaribandheey chakravaat sookhe kii sthiti se raahat dilaa sakate he
 They carry heat and energy from the tropics to temperate latitudes, making them an important part of the global atmospheric circulation system
 parinamswaroop, ushnkaribandheey chakravaat duniya bhar main taapmaana ko apekshaakrit sthir or garm banaae rakhane ke liye, prithvi ke shobhamandal main santulan banaae rakhane main madad aate he
 Many tropical cyclones develop when the atmosphere conditions are favorable, with a weak upheaval in the atmosphere
 duusare tab banate hai jab anya prakaar ke chakravaat ushnkaribandheey visheshtaon ko praapt kar lete hai
 Tropical systems then drift into the gorge with blowing winds; If the situation is favorable, the tropics become turbulent and then a center develops there
 varnakram ke duusare chor par, agar pranali ke aas paas kii sthitiyaan bighad jaati hai yaa ushnkaribandheey chakravaat bhum bichhal banate hai, to pranali kamazor ho jaati he or antat nasht ho jaati he
 a tropical cyclone becomes an extra-tropical cyclone when it moves to higher latitudes if its energy is released by the original condensation that changes from the heat to the atmosphere between the air states; From a functional point of view, a tropical cyclone does not become intertropical during its additional transition
 messocyclone hawa kaa ek bhavar he, jo lagbhag2 kilometre 10 kilometre band toofaan ke vyas main, main nihit hota he
 The wind arises and rotates in the same vertical axis, same direction as in a low pressure system in any hemisphere
 ve aksar tufaani hoti hai, arthath ye ek sthaniyakrut kam dabaav ke kshetra se jude hote hai
 Such storms cause severe winds and hail on the surface
 mensosaclones aksar ek saath ucch koshika main updrafts ke saath paae jate hai, jahaan ve andhad ban sakate hai
 About 1700 mesocyclones form in the United States each year, but only half of them form severe storms
 chakravaat prithvi ke liye niraale nahin hai
 Like small dark dots on the planet Varun, cyclonic storms are common on euphoric planets
 yah jaadugar kii aankh ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, kyonki yah great dark spot ke vyas se ek tihaai he
 It got the name of 'wizard's eye' because it sounds like an eye
 yah upasthiti jaaduugaron kii aankh ke bich main ek safed badal ke kaaran hota he
 Mars has also exhibited stormy winds
 ullaspurn tufaanon, jaise great red spot aamtaur par galati se vishaal tufaanon or chakravaateey tufaano ke rup main jane jate hai
 However, this is incorrect, because in reality this Great Red Spot is an anticyclone inverse event
 chudala ek vidhushi thi jiskaa aakhyaan yogavasishth main aayaa he
 In the Dwapar era, there was a king named Shikhidhwaj in the country of Malap
 uski patni saurashtra kii rajakanya thi-naam tha uskaa chudala
 Both continued to consume for a long time
 peeche unke man main aatm gyaan kii aakaanksha hui
 Both of them started leading the effort in their own way
 rani ne sankshep main samaj liya tha ki drushtikon ko badal lenaa or antajkaran ko saadh lenaa hi brahmagyaan he
 So she became very happy on that achievement
 raja ko bhi sikhaati, to ve stri ke prati hin bhaavana rakhane ke kaaran uski baat par dhyaan nahin dete the
 The king believed in ritualistic austerity, so he rose up in the night quietly and went to the forest
 rani ne yogabal se jaan liya, so rajkaaj swayan chalaane lagi
 Told the king to go away for some time
 ek din unne raja se milane kii ichha kii, so sookshm sharir se vahiin ja pahaunchi, jahaan raja tha
 Made of sage Kumar
 parichay poochne par apane ko naarad putr kaha
 His knowledge discussion with the king started
 par sandhya hote hi ve duhkhi hone lage
 Said i have cursed Durvasa
 din main purush or raatri main nari ho jaataa hoon
 Can you stand raja ne kaha-aatma na stri he, na purush
 Neither is there any small nor big
 darane jaisi koi baat nahin he aap hamaare mitra ho gayi hai prasantaapurvak saath main rahen
 Many hearts have passed
 mitrataa pragadh hui, to stri bane rishi kumaar ne kaha meri kaam vaasana prabal ho rahi he, rukaa nahin jaataa
 The king said, if there is no illusion on the soul, there is no flaw in body actions
 unka kaam-kreedaa prakaran chal padaa
 Neither the king was sorry, nor repented
 ab ve stri purush ko samaan maanane lage the
 Chudala reveals her true form and drags the king into the palace
 stri ko hey maanane or uske paraamarsh kii upeksha karne kaa hey bhav unke man se vidaa ho gaya
 The king considered Chudala as his mentor
 prasantaapurvak rajkaaj chalaate hue aatm gyaan main leen rahe

 The effect may be magnetic, acoustic, or pressurized
 chumbakeey surangon kaa fire jahaaj ke chumbakeey kshetra ke prabhaav ke kaaran hota he
 Acoustic tunnels fire from noise created by ship propellants
 dabaav vaale surangon kaa fire pani main chalate hue jahaaj se utpann dabaav kii tarangon se hota he
 Some tunnels fire with two effects, such as 'magnetic and acoustic' or 'pressure and magnetic'
 inhen 'sanyukt sangyojan' kehete hai or surang ke fire karne ke liye donon prabhaavon kii ek saath upasthiti aavashyak hoti he
 Removal of such tunnels is difficult
 surangon kaa upyog akraman evam raksha donon ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 They protect the harbor and coast when used for defense
 ye tateey jahaajon ko shatru ke akraman se bachaati hai
 If the tunnel is to be used for attack, tunnels are laid in the harbor entrance or practice area away from the enemy
 is prakaar nakebandi se suraksha kar sakate hai yaa shatru ke jahaajon ko dubaa sakate hai
 Sea level tunnels are generally meant for the invasion area only
 surang todane waalon ke kaary ko adhik dushkar banane ke liye vibhinn prakaar kii surangen ek hi kshetra main rakhi jaati hai taaki surang hataane ke liye es ke adhik vidhiyon kaa prayog karnaa pade
 The problem of breaking the enemy's tunnel is complicated by obstructing the fire of the tunnels
