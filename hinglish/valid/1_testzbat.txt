 Considerable criticism has been leveled against this practice, both by Hindu organizations opposed to state funding of private pilgrimage outside India and by Muslim pressure groups
 As an example of the latter, Mohib Ahmad contends that even Air India's subsidized fare is higher than competing airlines' ordinary fare
 However, the government has continued offering the Haj subsidy despite protests from the Muslim community at large
 Syed Shahabuddin claims that Air India's rising costs for travel, and the consequent increases in the Government of India's subsidy, have resulted partly from differences in foreign exchange rates beyond the airline's control
 He suggests charter fares should be set at two-thirds of regular IATA fares, but points out that the Haj has higher costs than other charters because two empty flights are required to return the aircraft to India and to position the aircraft in Arabia for the pilgrims' return journey
 Shahabuddin maintains that the subsidy ought to be phased out because Hindus view the subsidy as preferential treatment of India's Muslim minority
 Other Muslim leaders have argued that the Hajj subsidy is "un-islamic" and that Hajj money should be invested in education and health instead
 Maulana Mahmood Madani, a member of the Rajya Sabha and general secretary of the jamiat-e-ulema-e-hind, declared that the Hajj subsidy is a technical violation of Islamic Sharia, since the Quran declares that Hajj should be performed by Muslims using their own resources
 Influential Muslim lobbies in India have regularly insisted that the Hajj subsidy should be phased out as it is unislamic
 Likewise, Hindu groups argue that a government sponsored Hajj subsidy forcibly taxes Hindus to pay for Muslim religious pilgrimages, and tantamounts to appeasement of Islam
 After considerable pressure from Muslim groups and the Ministry of Minority Affairs, the Congress government in 2010 decided to begin phasing out the Haj subsidy that had been in operation since 1993
 The Central Haj Committee of India will work through the Ministry of External Affairs to restructure the Air fares so that the richer Hajis will pay a premium for the poorer pilgirms
 The entire restructuring is expected to take about seven years and be completed by 2017
 In August 2010, the Ministry of Minority Affairs formally opposed providing subsidy for Haj pilgrimage, saying the scheme - in operation since 1993 — was contrary to the teachings of Islam
 The Government of India has proposed that starting from 2011, the amount of government subsidy per person will be decreased, and by 2017 will be ended completely

 In the period from 1878 to 1885, Tolstoy remained inactive in terms of creating literary literature

 The whole world had become enlightened by their ethos of faith and the recognition of Yasnaya Polyana Village had become famous as an excellent pilgrimage center

 It was during these days that he read Tolstoy's compositions and was attracted to them

 Suddenly in 1910, he decided to abandon his ancestral village "yasnaya Polyana" forever

 His religion was very liberal and comprehensive

 manovaigyanik rachanaaon main fyodor dostoyevski hi tolastay ke samakaksh thaharte hai
 Tolstoy has a notable influence on great writers such as Galsvardi, Thomas Mann, Jules Romeo, etc
 parvarti roosi lekhakon ko bhi tollstoy ne yathesht prabhavit kiya he
 Many scholars of the world, including Lenin, have accepted the best of Tolstoy's literature, especially 'war and Peace', from Muktakantha; But Tolastoy was also a thinker and expressed his ideas in literary works as well as in essays and other genres
 unke yugin sandarbh vichaaron kii upyogita ke sambandh main lenin kaa maananaa he ki "tolastoy ne aisa lalit sahitya rachaa he, jo tab janata ke liye sadaa moolyawaan or pathneey hoga, jab vah jameendaaron or puunjipatiyon kaa takhta ulat kar apane liye manuyochit saamaajik jivan kii vyavastha kar legi
 At the same time, Tolstoy has been able to express the mood of the general public and describe his condition, and express his spontaneous feelings of protest and fury with remarkable oz
 tolastoy mukhyatah 1861 se 1904 tak ke yug ke the or unhone -- ek kalakaar, vichaarak evam upadeshak ke naate -- apni kritiyon main samoochee pratham roosi kranti kii aitihaasik vishistataaon ko, uski kshamtaaon or trutiyon ko ascharyajanak spashtataa ke saath ubhaara he
 " iske baavjood pracheen vyavastha kii vividh khaamiyon, amir varg kii aantarik nissartaa tathaa uske viruddh prakat tolastoy ke vichaaron ke sandarbh main lenin kaa kahana he ki "tolastoy kii aalochana main koi nayi baat nahin thi
 He did not say anything that had not been said to him long ago by the advocates of the working people in European and Russian literature
 tolastoy kii aalochana kii visheshta evam aitihaasik mahatv is baat main he ki hamaare vichaaradhin kaal ke rus -- dehati, kisaanon ke rus -- ke vyapak jan samudaay ke drushtikon main jo amul parivartan aa rahaa tha, uski abhivyakti usamen aise ojase kii gayi he, jo kisi pratibhavan kalakaar ke hi bas kaa kaam tha
 " tolastoy ke saahitiyik mahatv ko lenin bakhubi samajhate the or isliye unhone uski baari prashansa bhi kii he; parantu saath-saath yugin sandarbh main unke vichaaron ke kai hanikaarak pahaluon se sachet rahane kii anivaaryta bhi ve acchhee tarah samajhate the
 Therefore, in December 1910, he had explicitly expressed the idea that by studying Tolstoy's literary works, the Russian working class would be able to recognize its enemies better
 unke siddhanton kaa adhyayan karke samast roosi janata yah jarur jaanegi ki uski nijee kamajori, jisane use apni aazaadee kaa lakshya puraa karne se roka, kis baat main nihit thi
 It is important to know in order to move forward
 is pragati main vah sab log baadha daal rahe hai, jo tolastoy ko 'ham sabakaa antahkaran', 'jivan-shikshak' ghoshit karte hai
 This is the lie that liberals are deliberately spreading as they want to use the anti-revolution aspect of Tolstoy's principles
 tolastoy ke 'jivan-shikshak' hone kaa jhooth udaarataavaadiyon kii dekha-dekhi kuch bhootpurv saamaajik-janavaadee bhi duhara rahe hai
 The Russian people will gain independence only if they understand that they have to learn to fight for a better life, not from Tolstoy, but from a class whose importance Tolstoy could not understand and that old world, which Tolstoy hated
 , Is the only class capable of overthrow - that is, from the proletariat
 22 janvari 1911 ko lenin ne punah vistaar se tolastoy kii kuch kathatmak rachanaaon ke saath-saath anek cathetar rachanaaon kaa udhaaharan dete hue yah vichaar vyakt kiya tha ki tolastowad main pratikriyaavaadi tathaa utapian tatv hone ke baavjood aaj se 25 varsh pehle janata ke kuch halkon ke liye shaayad kabhi-kabhi tolastoy ke siddhanton ke aalochanatmak tatwon kii vyavhaarik upyogita ho sakati thi
 But now, for example in the last decade, such a thing could not happen, because from the ninth decade of the last century to the end of the century, historical development has moved very far
 atah aaj jab uparokt ghatnaon ne 'purvi' gatiheenata kaa ant kar diya he, aaj, jab 'vekhi'-panthiyon ke sachetan rup se pratikriyaavaadi, sankeern-vargeey tathaa swaarthee-vargeey arthon main pratikriyaavaadi vichaar udaaravaadi burjua logon main itane vyapak rup se fail gayi hai, aaj, jab in vichaaron kii chhot kuch dikhaau marxvaadiyon ko bhi lag gayi he, jiskaa parinaam 'visarjanwaadee' pravriti he, to tolastoy ke siddhanton ko adarsh bataane, unke 'apratirodh' unki 'aatma' kii duhaayiyon, 'atmoddhar' ke liye unke aahvaan, 'antahkaran' or vishwa 'prem' ke siddhant, tapasyavaad or quaitism ke unke upadesh, aadi-aadi ko uchit tehraane yaa un par lipapoti karne kii har koshish pratyakshtam or gahanatam haani hi karti he

 Usually the cold front moves faster than the hot front and combines with the higher density hawrasi that are ahead of the cyclone, and the higher denser hawrashi that is behind the cyclone generates a wider hot area

 Tropical cyclogenesis is a technical term used to develop and strengthen a tropical storm located in the atmosphere
 vah prakriya jiske jariye ushnkaribandheey sexogenesis ghatit hota he, vah madhya akshansh sexogenesis ghatane se alag hota hai
 The tropical cyclonic fraction is helpful in developing a warm-weather cyclone that is formed due to the favorable critical environment
 ushnkaribandheey sexlogenesis kii chah mukhya aavashyaktaayen hai : paryaapt garm samudri sataha kaa taapmaana, vayumandaleey asthirataa, nimna se madhya str vaale troposphior main ucch ardrata, aavashyak coreolis bal, ek purv astitv praapt nimna str yaa uthal puthal or kam urdhwadhar katarti hawa

 Radar imagery is used to identify these features

 There are six main types of cyclones: polar cyclones, polar low, extra-tropical cyclones, inter-tropical cyclones, tropical cyclones and mesocyclones
 ek dhruviya kam chote paimaane par, kam samay tak jivit kam dabaav pranali he jo donon uttari or dakshini golardh ke mukhya dhruviya agrant ke saamne mahaasaagar kshetron par paayi jaati he
 This system is usually less visible on the parallel scale and cannot survive more than one to two days
 ve bade varg ke messoscale mausam pranali kaa hissaa he
 Polar lows are harder to detect than traditional weather reports and are a threat to high latitude processes, such as shipping, gas, and oil platforms
 dhruviya kam kaa ullekh anya shabdon se bhi kiya jaataa he, jaise ki dhruviya messoscal bhavar, arctic toofaan, arctic kam or thand hawa kaa dabaav 
aamtaur par yah shabd adhik joardaar pranaaliyon ke liye arakshit kiya gaya he jaha kam se kam 17 meter kii nikat-sataha kii hawaaen he
 1 ek attirikt ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ek sankshipt paimaane par kam dabaav vaali mausam pranali he jinke na to ushnkaribandheey or na hi koi dhruviya visheshtaayen hai, jo taapmaana or him bindu main agrant or samaanaantar dhaal main judy hui hoti he, ise vaise "baroclinics kshetra " kaha jaataa he
 The term 'extra-tropical' refers to the fact that such cyclones occur outside the planet's tropics, between the middle latitudes
 in pranaaliyon main unke kshetreey gathan yaa uttar ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ke kaaran 'madhya akshansh chakravaat' ke rup main suchit kiya jaataa he, jahaan attirikt ushnkaribandheey sankraman hota he or aksar mausam kaa purv anumaan lagane waalon or aam janata ke dwaara 'kam' yaa 'kam dabaav' varnit hota hai
 These are everyday events that, along with opposing cyclones, make up the majority of the Earth's climate
 haalanki atirikt ushnkaribandheey chakravaaton ko lagbhag hameshaa baroclinics kaha jaataa he, kyonki ye pashchimi hawa ke taapmaana or himbindu dhaar ke kshetron ke saath rahete he or kabhi kabhi ye barotropic bhi ban jaataa he jab chakravaat ke paas kaa taapmaana vitaran trigya ke saath ek samaan ho jaataa he
 An extra-tropical cyclone converts into a subclassic storm and from there into an inter-tropical cyclone if it remains above warm water and develops its original heat into central convection
 ek ant: ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ek mausam pranali he jiske kuch lakshan ushnkaribandheey chakravaat or kuch atirikt ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ke hote hai
 These can form between the equator and the 50th parallel
 1950 ke dashak se hi antariksh vigyaan shastriyon ko yah samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha ki ise ve ushnkaribandheey chakravaat kahen yaa adhik ushn katibandheey chakravaat kahen 
 isiilie inhen ve ushnkaribandheey samaan or arddh ushnkaribandheey kehete the jo sankar chakravaat bhi kahe jate the 1972 tak main rashtriya harrican centre ne ise sarkari taur par is chakravaat varg ko manyata di
 From 2002 onwards, tropical tropical cyclones began to receive names from the Atlantic Basin from the official tropical cyclone list
 unke paas vyapak hawa pratimaan he, jo adhiktam hawa ko tham saktaa he jo ushnkaribandheey chakravaaton ke mukaable centre se dur sthit hote he or jo kamjor se lekar madhya str tak ke taapmaana tak paaya jaataa he
 Because they are formed by more tropical cyclones whose temperatures are cooler than other cuttings, the ocean surface temperature used for their formation is three degrees Celsius, or five degrees Fahrenheit lower than the tropical cyclone threshold, Happens around 23 ° C
 isse yah pataa chalata he ki antah ushn katibandheey chakravaat paramparaagat seemaa ke baahar tufaani mausam main banate hai
 Although inter-tropical storms rarely have the pressure of stormy winds, they can be tropical in nature if their elements are heated
 ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ek tufaani pranali he, jo ek kam dabaav centre he or garajadaar toofaan, tej hawaaen or zyada varsha detaa he
 a tropical cyclone is formed when heat is released from moist air, resulting in the release of vapor contained in moist air
 ye alag garmi ghatakon dwaara banati he or anya chakravaateey tufaano, jaise nor'isters, europea aandhiya, dhruviya kam, tufaani pranalia kehalaati he
 The term 'tropical' refers to both geologic forms, which are found exclusively in the tropical regions of the globe, and sea breeze is formed in tropical air clusters
 'chakravaat' shabd prakruti se tufaani chakravaat ko suchit karata he, jo uttari golarddh main uttaravarat or dakshini golarddh main dakshinavart ghoomte he
 Tropical cyclones are also known by other names, depending on location and power, such as hurricanes, hurricanes, tropical storms, cyclonic storms, tropical pressures, or cyclones only
} In general, a tropical cyclone is called a hurricane in the Atlantic basin and the Pacific Ocean

 They develop on large bodies of hot water and their strength is reduced due to moving over the ground
 isi kaaran ushnkaribandheey tufaan se tateey kshetron ko kaaphi nuksaan ho saktaa he, jabaki antardeshiy kshetra inase apekshaakrit surakshit rahete hai
 Heavy rains, however, create flooding conditions in inland areas and storm waves create widespread coastal flooding conditions over the coastline
 yadhyapi maanav aabaadi par unke prabhaav vinaashkari ho sakate he, ushnkaribandheey chakravaat sookhe kii sthiti se raahat dilaa sakate he
 They carry heat and energy from the tropics to temperate latitudes, making them an important part of the global atmospheric circulation system
 parinamswaroop, ushnkaribandheey chakravaat duniya bhar main taapmaana ko apekshaakrit sthir or garm banaae rakhane ke liye, prithvi ke shobhamandal main santulan banaae rakhane main madad aate he
 Many tropical cyclones develop when the atmosphere conditions are favorable, with a weak upheaval in the atmosphere
 duusare tab banate hai jab anya prakaar ke chakravaat ushnkaribandheey visheshtaon ko praapt kar lete hai
 Tropical systems then drift into the gorge with blowing winds; If the situation is favorable, the tropics become turbulent and then a center develops there
 varnakram ke duusare chor par, agar pranali ke aas paas kii sthitiyaan bighad jaati hai yaa ushnkaribandheey chakravaat bhum bichhal banate hai, to pranali kamazor ho jaati he or antat nasht ho jaati he
 a tropical cyclone becomes an extra-tropical cyclone when it moves to higher latitudes if its energy is released by the original condensation that changes from the heat to the atmosphere between the air states; From a functional point of view, a tropical cyclone does not become intertropical during its additional transition
 messocyclone hawa kaa ek bhavar he, jo lagbhag2 kilometre 10 kilometre band toofaan ke vyas main, main nihit hota he
 The wind arises and rotates in the same vertical axis, same direction as in a low pressure system in any hemisphere
 ve aksar tufaani hoti hai, arthath ye ek sthaniyakrut kam dabaav ke kshetra se jude hote hai
 Such storms cause severe winds and hail on the surface

 About 1700 mesocyclones form in the United States each year, but only half of them form severe storms

 In the late 19th and early to mid-20th century, the Congress became a central partner in the Indian freedom struggle, with more than 1
5 crore members and more than 70 million participants, opposing British colonial rule

 ayurvigyaan vigyaan kii vah shakha he, jiskaa sambandh maanav sharir ko nirog rakhane, rog ho jane par rog se mukt karne athwa uskaa nidaan karne tathaa aayu badhaane se he
 India is the father of medical science
 apane praarambhik samay main ayurvigyaan kaa adhyayan jeev vigyaan kii ek shakha ke samaan hi kiya gaya tha
 Later, 'anatomy' and 'physiology' etc
 were made its basis

 The knowledge of the actions that take place in the body revealed that their form is very chemical and these phenomena are the result of the chemical activities
 jyon-jyon khojein huin tyon-tyon sharir kii ghatnaon kaa rasinic rup saamne aata gaya
 In this way, chemistry became so important that it became a separate branch of medicine, which was named biochemistry
 iske dwaara na keval shaareerik ghatnaon kaa rup spasht hua, varan rogon kii utpatti tathaa unke pratirodh kii vidhiyaan bhi nikal ain
 At the same time, physics also helped in understanding physical phenomena very well
 yah gyaat hua ki anek ghatnaayen bhautik niyamon ke anusaar hi hoti hai
 Like biochemistry, biophysics has also become a part of medical science and it has also helped in understanding the origin of diseases and in resisting them
 vigyaan kii anya shakhaon se bhi rogrodhan tathaa chikitsa main bahut sahaayta mili he
 And with the help of all these, a lot of progress has been made in the welfare of human beings, which has resulted in increased lifespan
 sharir, shaareerik ghatnaon or rog sambandhi aantarik kriyaaon kaa sookshm gyaan praapt karne main anek prakaar kii praayogic vidhiyon or yantron se, jo samay-samay par banate rahe hai, bahut sahaayta mili he
 But the result of this in-depth study is that medical science is divided into many branches and so much discovery has been made in each branch, new tools have been made and experimental methods have been known that no scholar or student can be fully familiar with them all
 
 din--prati--din chikitsak ko prayogshaalaon tathaa yantron par nirbhar rahanaa pad rahaa he or yah nirbharta uttarottar bad rahi he
 The goal of every education is the mental development of a human being, so that it can generate the power to reason and understand and manifest and implement its emotions accordingly
 ayurvigyaan kii shiksha kaa bhi yahi uddeshy he
 For this, among all medical students, the student has to spend five years as an undergraduate
 medical collejon main vidhyaarthiyon ko aadhaar vigyaanon kaa adhyayan karke ucch madhyamik shiksha praapt karne par bharti kiya jaataa he
 After that the first two years, the student studies the basic principles called anatomy and physiology, so that he becomes aware of the natural condition of the body
 iske pashchaat teen varsh rogon ke kaaran in swaabhaavik dashaon kii vikrutiyaan kaa gyaan paane tathaa unki chikitsa kii reeti seekhney main vyateet hote hai
 Measures to prevent diseases and pharmacopoeia, which is the policy related branch of this science, he studies during this period
 in paanch varshon ke adhyayan ke pashchaat vah snaatak banataa he
 After this, he works in a department according to his interest for one year and obtains functional knowledge of that subject
 tatpashchaat vah snatakottar shikshan main diploma yaa degree lene ke liye kisi vibhaag main bharti ho saktaa he
 All medical colleges belong to one or the other university which conducts their examinations and courses and aims to generate the power of reasoning in science students and inaugurate new science mysteries
 ayurvigyaan vidyalayon ke prayek shikshak tathaa vidhyaarthee kaa bhi uddeshy yahi hona chahie ki use roganivarak nai vastuon kii khoj karke is artinashak kala kii unnati karne kii cheshtaa kerani chahie
 Not only this, the life goal of teachers should also be that they produce such investigators

 Here he does not get all the tools of help which he had seen during his teaching period and which he had learned to use
 bade nagaron main ye bahut kuch uplabdh ho jate hai
 When required, he has to seek the help of a specialist or send the patient to the hospital
 aajkal is vigyaan kii kisi ek shakha kaa vishesh adhyayan karke kuch chikitsak visheshgy ho jate hai
 In this way, special treatment is available by experts in heart disease, mental diseases, astigmatism, pediatric etc
 aajkal chikitsa kaa vyay bahut bad gaya he
 Essential examinations, valuable drugs, methods of medicine and equipment are the main reasons for the diagnosis of the disease
 aadhunik ayurvigyaan ke kaaran janata kaa jeevankaal bhi bad gaya he, parantu aushadhiyon par bahut vyay hota he
 It is to be regretted that due to the present economic conditions, proper treatment has gone beyond the power of ordinary human beings
 chikitsavigyaan kii shakti ab bahut bad gai he or nirantar badhati ja rahi he
 Nowadays contraception can be done
 garbh kaa ant bhi ho saktaa he
 The mitigation of pain, keeping in unconsciousness for a long time, the successful treatment of many infectious diseases, suppression and enhancement of instincts, the change of sentiment by drugs, the effect on personality by surgery, etc
 have all become possible
 manushya kaa jeevankaal adhik ho gaya he
 New medicines are coming out day-by-day; The cause of diseases is being known; His treatment is being known
