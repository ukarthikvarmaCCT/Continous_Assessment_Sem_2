 atev vyapak arth main ekadhinayakeey sarkaar vah vyavastha he jisamen rajya ke ek yaa kai sadsy khule tathaa vyavasthit dhang se puure raashtra par shakti kaa -jise unhone purv ke sabhi vaid aadhikaron or sthapanaaon ke ulanghan ke falswaroop honevaali hinsa se arjeet kiya he-prayog sarkaar main bhaag na lenevaali janata kii sammati se swatantra rahakar karte hai
 Depending on the nature of the government, monopolies can be divided into two categories: vaiyaktik ekadhinaayakatv main ekadhinaayak apane nijee karmchaariyon kii sahaayta se 'fayurar' ke siddhant ke aadhaar par swatantra dhang se shashan karata he
 The specialty of the furor is that he is not responsible to his assistants, but declares his obligation to the nation — history, or God — above himself
 fayurar apane sahaayakon ko niyukt karata he jo apane adheen karmchaariyon ko or ye karmchaaree phir apane adheenon ko niyukt karte hai
 Thus the electoral system has no place in the entire system and the entire structure is observed at the highest peak point
 samuhik ekadhinaayakatv main fayurar ke sthaan par uttaradaayi netaa hote hai; netaaon kii ek shrenee ucchtar shrenee ke netaaon ko chunati he, prayek netaa apane nirvaachakon ke prati uttaradaayi hota he
 Thus, the entire structure is based on the lowest base
 saamaajik shaktiyon ke aadhaar par bhi ekadhinaayakatv ke do varg ho sakate hai
 Therefore, this division takes place on the basis of ruling and auxiliary class
 varg ekadhinaayakatv ke aadhunik teen pramukh prakaar hai : sainya, dal or prashaskeey
 The third classification can be on the basis of quantitative format; As such, adhinayakawad ke teenon vargeekaran ek duusare se sambhddha bhi ho sakate hai
 Military monopolies, as such, can be both private and collective
 sabhi mahatvapurn ekadhinaayakataaon main dharmik sampradayikta kii visheshta hoti he, yatha utsaah ke saath pravartak kii puja tathaa ek vishisht vidhi ke prati shraddha
 Driven by great individuals, always inspired by a lucrative ideology, demanding sacrifices as a duty to its followers, monolithicism is a form of government established by an active individual
 vah un parakramee or gatisheel virgo ko lekar chalata he jo swabhaavat: viplav ke liye pravrutt hote hai : yatha, sena, shur varg yaa sarvhaara varg
 Ekadhinayak continues to impose his will and thoughts on the governed
 is aropan ke do saadhan hai: nakaaratmak, sakaaratmak
 Negative means are to stop criticism, destroy anti-majority or minority, keep essential and important facts related to the state a secret
 in sadhano ke sahaayak saadhan hai: sansad kii samaapti, sanghon tathaa dalon kaa vighatan, press par pratibandh, shiksha par niyantran, pramukh virodhiyon kaa nishkasana aadi
 Violence and terror are also discussed in this regard, but in reality these are only the signs of the initial state of monopolies, which are generally revolutionary and therefore illegal
 yadi ekadhinaayakatv is avasthaa se guzarane main safal hua to vah saadhaarant : hinsa or aatank ke sthaan par prashaskeey vidhaan sthapit karata he
 Military monopolies are generally satisfied by these negative means; But class monopolism also uses positive means in addition to these; As such, the imposition of public opinion, views and opinions of public by publicity, creation of favorable opinion etc
 in sadhano ke sahaayak saadhan hai : rashtriya yaa vargpratikon kii puja, uttejk sangeet kaa prasar, dambh yaa ghrinaa kii bhavanaayen ubhaaranevaale bhaashan, ajnapaalan kii aadat daalane ke liye samast raashtra ko sainya shiksha dena, vidyalayon ke liye pustaken taiyaar karnaa, abuddhik vichaardhaara kaa prachaar, raajnneetigyon, patrakaron tathaa vidwaanon ko ghoose dekar unka munh band karnaa
 But in any civilized country, which has had a past or idealist or democratic, these means are not sufficient to establish monotheism as long as it has attractive ideals, such as obedience, discipline, authority, unity, power, patriotism etc
 There should not be a continuous appeal to the person and the person should not be enthusiastic about giving up his personal rights in the hands of the monarch
 iske liye dharm se sambandhit bhaavon ko vikrut kar apane rajya, raashtra, jati yaa varg kii stuti yaa puja ke bhaavon main parinat kiya jaataa he
 Apart from the manner in which monopolistic establishment is established illegally, its elimination is often impossible
 ekadhinayakawad raashtra ko swytt shashan kii vidhiyaan seekhney se roktaa he or isliye ek ekadhinaayak ke dehanth ke baad vyaktiyon or virgo main satta ke liye pratidwandvita raashtra ke liye vipatti kaa kaaran ban sakati he
 There are so many benefits in the practice of the dictatorship system that in many democratic states, the public starts to wish for a dictatorial system, bored with the freedom to arbitrate some people in democracy
 agar adhinayakatantr ke utkarsh ke kaarnon kii khoj kii jaae to vidit hoga ki jis-jis desh main niraashaa, avyavashtha, asantosh tathaa abhaav tha vahiin adhinayakatantr kaa udai hua he
 In countries where the system of democracy became frustrating and lacking in people, this system was established
 aaj bhi anek rajyon main janata adhinayakatantr ko acha maanakar nirankush shaskaon kaa purna samarthan karti hui dikhaai detii he
 From this it is clear that the Adhinayaktantra has some qualities which are responsible for the motivation to adopt this system despite the theoretical superiority of other systems
 sankshep main aise shashan ke nimnlikhit laabh hai- Governance is efficient in the dictatorship
 sari shashan shakti ek vyakti main nihit hone ke kaaran, na keval nirnay shighrata se liye ja sakate he, varan nirnyon ke kriyanvayan kii bhi suvyavastha ho jaati he
 In the dictatorial system, everyone is afraid of the ruler, therefore, he cannot delay or relax the work
 nirankush shaasha ke prati sampoorn prashasan na keval uttaradaayi rahata he apitu har samay satark, sachet va sakriy bhi rahata he
 This leads to efficiency in governance
 is vyavastha kaa doosraa gun desh kaa teji se vikaas he
 Having only one leader, one plan and one development goal in the country, the entire power of the country is used to pave the way to this goal
 aarthik sadhano kaa samuchit vikaas va upyog sambhav hota he
 The development of the country requires unity, peace and order
 adhinayakatantr main inaki thos vyavastha rahane ke kaaran desh ke saare saadhan vikaas main lagaae ja sakate hai
 The dictatorship is very helpful in establishing unity in the country
 vibhinn dalon tathaa virodhiyon kaa daman karke desh main ek dal va ek netaa kaa shashan sthapit hone ke kaaran sari janata iske prati vafaadaar ho jaati he
 All the arrangements around the leader are intertwined and the country is tied into a single thread of solid unity
 dal yaa netaa ekta main baandhne kaa saadhan ho jaataa he or usee main sabko apnatv kaa abhas hone lagata he
 Hitler and Mussolini were similarly successful in uniting Germany and Italy
 rashtinyata kii bhaavana jaagrath karne main sahaayak he
 Having an ideology, a party and a leader is sufficient to bind the citizens of the country in reciprocity
 sabhi naagarik bandhutv kii bhaavana se anupranit rahete hai
 The slogan of a nation makes everyone stand under the same flag
 desh bhakthi kaa itnaa prabalya hota he ki naagarik apane desh tathaa netaa ke liye balidaan tak karne ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai
 The dictatorial system is the best in times of crisis
 isamen sankat kaa saamana karne ke liye sabhi nirnay va adarsh ek vyakti dwaara diye jane ke kaaran, adeshon kii ekta rahati he
 This makes it easy to take appropriate action on time
 yudhkalin sankat main to yahi vyavastha vijay dilaati he
 Multifaceted development of the country takes place in a dictatorial system
 aarthik kshetra main bhi teji se vikaas kii vyavastha hoti he
 Due to unity, discipline and duty-devotion, the best system of development is achieved
 rus, germany, china, italy, turki or spain kaa abhi tak itihaas is baat kaa sakshi he
 In his book Europe Sins the War, Jackson rightly writes - "this is the first time in the history of the Spaniards that the trains have run on time
" adhinaayak ke adheen vyapaar or udyog samrudh hue hai
 Agriculture is fruitful
 shram sankat dur ho gaye hai
 " kuch vidwaan adhinayakatantr ko maanav-swabhaav ke anukool bhi maanate hai
 In its favor, he says that human beings naturally have a desire to protect their interests
 vah apni raksha chahta he chaahe yah kisi ke dwaara kii jaay
 Wants to solve his problems
 aam janata ko isse koi matlab nahin hota he ki uski raksha vyavastha cor karata he? vah to suraksha chaahati he, apane hiton kii purti chaahati he
 Due to such a possibility in Adhinayakatantra, it is also considered a system suited to human nature
 vikasshil rajyon ke liye raajnneetik or aarthik vikaas kii sankramanakalin paristhitiyon main bhi adhinayakatantr upyogi mana gaya he
 In developing states, the problem of disciplined expression of public will has been very strong
 vikaas ke vibhinn charnon ko paar karne ke prayaas main navdith raashtra jan aakankshaon ko jaagrit to kar dete hai, parantu jan aakankshaayen jitani teji se jaagrit hoti hai, utani teji se ve unki purti nahin kar pate hai
 Due to this, the tension on the state system increases and there is a fear of its breakdown
 aisi sthiti main raajnneetik anushaasan banaae rakhane ke liye adhinayakatantr adhik upyogi ho saktaa he
 Huntington has rightly said that 'the first task in the newly born nations should be to build a basic, institutional structure in place of increase of political participation, education etc
 and for this one-party rule or military dictatorship may also be appropriate
 ’ Despite the merits of the Adhinayaktantra, this system is not practiced in any country for a long period
 itihaas aise pramaanon se bharaa padaa hai jahaan kahin bhi adhinayakatantr sthapit hota he vahiin par ek sthiti aisi aati he jab janata satta sampann sarvocch shaasha ko ukhaad phenkane ke liye hinsaatmak kranti tak kaa sahaara lene main nahin hichkichaati he
 It is clear from this that some shortcomings are definitely found in this system
 sankshep main is pranali ke dosha is prakaar hai- Due to the lack of respect for the personality of the person in this system, despite all the facilities, the person does not get the environment to develop his personality according to his will and he is forced to keep his life incomplete
 vyakti ko kisi bhi prakaar swatantraaa nahin rahati he
 This keeps his personality suppressed
 taanaashaahee vyavastha main moulik adhikaron evam vyaktigat swatantraaa ko koi mahatv nahin diya jaataa he
 Therefore, the biggest drawback of the dictatorial system is to create an atmosphere of repression of the personality of the person
 adhinayakatantr shashan vyavastha main atyaachaar or anachar kaa bolbalaa rahata he
 The dictator continues to spread terror to maintain his power
 virodhiyon kaa barbar tareekon se safaya kar diya jaataa he
 Due to this, humans get frightened and get locked up in jail
 desh hit main kahi gai baat bhi agar taanashaah kii ichha ke pratikul he to usko thukraa diya jaataa he tathaa uske viruddh baat kehane vaale ko deshvidrohi kahkar maut ke ghat utaar diya jaataa he
 The dictatorial system is detrimental to the country
 is vyavastha main nirnay ek vyakti letaa he jo kisi bhi prakaar kaa virodh yaa suzav sweekaar nahin karata he
 Due to this, the whole people have to suffer the harmful effects of wrong decisions taken by the dictator
 adhinaayak kaa har nirdesh logon ko maananaa padataa he, chaahe vah nirdesh rashtiy hit main ho athwa nahin ho
 Thus, there is no proper protection of national interests in dictatorial system
 adhinayakatantr main saadhaaran vyaktiyon main aatm-nirbharta, kriyasheeltaa tathaa swatantraaa kii bhaavana kaa purnatah lop ho jaataa he, kyonki unhen bolne athwa vichaarne aadi kii kisi prakaar kii swatantraaa nahin rahati he
 In this system, a person's body, wealth and even his mind becomes for the Adhinayak and he is forced to walk wherever the Adhinayak is
 adhinayakatantr ke gun or dosha ke vivechan se spasht he ki yah vyavastha manushya ko manushya nahin banaati tathaa use manushya ke rup main rahane bhi nahin detii he
 In this, the personality of the human remains suppressed
 uski sari bhautik aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke uparant bhi usko kuch kami si mahasoos hoti he
 His life becomes like a prisoner
 isliye hi adhinayakatantr ke anek laabhon ke hote hue bhi koi vyakti is vyavastha ke antargat rahanaa pasand nahin karata he
 Everything remains for the person in this regime, but still he suffocates in such a system, because the person does not live only for bread
 vah iske alaava bhi bahut kuch paanaa va karnaa chahta he jo keval sochane-vichaarne tathaa abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke vaataavaran main hi sambhav hota he
 Therefore, in spite of all the attractions of the Adhinayaktantra, stress remains invalid by the common people due to it being a deterrent to the means of satisfying the hunger of the brain
 is shashan ke gun-dosha ke vivechan ke baad iske bhavishya ke bare main sanket dena saral ho jaataa he
 Occupational medicine is that branch of clinical medicine that deals with occupational health

 bahut pehle se hi swasthyavetta yah maanate aa rahe hai ki kaam karne waalon ke swasthya or kalyaan karne kii paristhitiyon kaa prabhaav padataa he, jaisaa barordine ramazzane ) kii is tippanee se pratyaksh ho jaataa he- Workers generally spend a third of their time in their work place and hence they are particularly affected by the physical, chemical and psychological conditions of their work
 saadhaarant: bhautik paristhitiyaan ye hai : garmi, thandak, ardrata, prakaash aadi
 Chemical elements are: various gases, smoke, dust etc
 manovaigyanik tatv hai : swasthyavishyak suvidhaayen, prakaash, pine tathaa munh haath dhone kaa pani, manovinod, upaahargrih, sangrakshak upkaran, baithne tathaa vishram kii suvidhaayen, rahan-sahan kii dasha, prabandhakon kaa bartaav, tathaa ucchtar adhikariyon tak pahunchne kii suvidhaayen
 The effect of these elements is complex and any one or more of these actions can have an impact on the health, well-being and ability of the worker
 yah dekha gaya he ki jab garmi athwa thand se bechaini utpann hoti he tab utpaadan par bura prabhaav padataa he, choti-choti durghatnaayen bad jaati hai, shramikon kaa man mar jaataa he or unamem asantosh failata he

 Adverse conditions also lead to special sufferings and diseases that have an impact on the production and competence of the artisans
 badhane par audyogic rogon ko pahchaanana bahut kathin nahin hota kintu aarambhik lakshanon kaa anveshan or unke kaarnon kii pahchaan karnaa kuch kathin or saath hi rochak bhi he
 Industrial diseases are difficult to classify, generally they can be classified into the following categories: prakritik madhyam se honevaale rog - thand se anthan, garmi se lu yaa ushmaghat, motiyobind, paala maarna, daab, kesan kaa rog, jisamen vaayu daab ke ekaek ghatane ke kaaran saare sharir main badi pidaa hoti he tathaa vivik raktaprasaranavrodh -jisamen vaayu ke bulabulon ke kaaran rudhir kaa bahna ruk jaataa he
 Chemical diseases - diseases that occur due to workers working with potas, aniline, chemical raz, asbestos, mercury, lead, arsenic and other poisons
 rasinic gaison, jaise ammonia, fosajin, nitras dhuen, benzin aadi ke vaashp se honevaali vishaaktata
 Psychiatric cause diseases - shivering of the pupils of the eye
 upar jin audyogic rogon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he unamem se kuch to bahut mahatvapurn hai
 The governments of most countries have made a rule that they get information as soon as the disease occurs
 bharat main factory act dwaara 17 rogon ko vigyapneey kar diya gaya he, chikitsakon ke dekhne main yadi aisa koi rogi aa jaae jo inamen se kisi rog se aakraant ho to chikitsak ke liye sarkaar ko soochna dena anivaary kar diya gaya he
 These diseases are: lead, tetraethyl, phosphorus, mercury, arsenic, nitrous smoke, carbon bisulfide, benzene, chromium salts, dust, iodine, bromine, radioactive substances and x-ray diseases and anthrax, skin cancer, toxic anemia and toxic Disease called jaundice
 audyogic rogon main se praaia: sabhi roke ja sakate hai, at: vyavsaayik ayurvigyaan ke adhyayan tathaa vyavsaay kaa atyadhik mahatv swayansiddh he
 The field of vocational medical service is not the same in every country, but it generally covers the following industrial work: prevention of diseases, improvement of working conditions in factories, treatment of industrial accidents and any other injured or crippled industrial artisans
 Make workable
 yathochit audyogic rogopchaar seva ke liye ek chikitsak, ek kaaya pareekshak, ek yogya ejeeniyar, ek rasayanajna, ek sharir-vigyaan-vetta, ek bhautik chikitsa karanevaala tathaa ek audyogic nurse honi chahie
 This whole team should work in mutual cooperation because the early symptoms of industrial diseases and their diagnosis will depend on the inspection of each member of this team
 udhaahrant: sise kii vishaaktata ke nidaan ke liye yah aavashyak he ki chikitsak karigar kii saadhaaran pariksha kare, kaayapareekshak us rogi ke rakt ke chitra banaakar de, biochemist malmutra main rog ke sanchayan kaa pataa lagaae, rasayanajna vaayu main sise kii maatra kaa anusandhan kare, ejeeniyar is baat kaa pataa lagaae ki kaarkaane kii kin mashiinon se yah vish utpann ho hota he
 If an artisan has been crippled by industrial disease or injury, the specialist can help to make it workable again
 audyogic nurse keval chikitsak kii hi sahaayta nahin karti varan vah karigar ko swasthya or kalyaan ke vishay main paraamarsh dene kaa bhi kaam karti he
 The industrial doctor has to do the initial treatment of the artisan and diagnose his disease, as well as to test the craftsmen before determining their entry into the factories and also to determine the specific work that the artisan is capable of according to his physical ability
 Should, or he should not be allowed to work in the factory
 isi prakaar use un kaarigaron kii bhi samay-samay par chikitsiya pariksha karte rahanaa padataa he jo bhayaavah prakriyaaon par lagaae jate hai, jisase bhayaavah saamagree ke sampark se kaarigaron par dhire-dhire padanevaale bure prabhaav kii jaankaree samay se ho sake
 It is also the responsibility of the industrial doctor to continue to perform small services, such as protecting teeth, etc
 use shramikon kii manovaigyanik samasyaon ke sambandh main bhi paraamarsh dena padataa he, at: yadi use shramik maalik donon kaa hi vishwasabhajan bananaa he to use apane kaary main vishesh daksh hona chahie
 It has been proved that in the big shops where good industrial treatment service is available, not only does it come out of its expenditure, but there is also extra benefit, because it can produce good goods at the least expense in the industry
