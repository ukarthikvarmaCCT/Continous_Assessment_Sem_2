 is samay gandhi ji ne andolan ko band kar diya jisase congressi netaaon sahit lagbhag 100,000 rajnatik bandiyon ko reeha kar diya gaya
 In 1946, Gandhiji advised the Congress to reject the proposal of the British kbnet Mission as he was deeply skeptical of the proposed grouping for Muslim dominated provinces, hence Gandhi viewed the episode as a rehearsal of a partition

 shuddh araajaktaa kaa nikatatam drushtikon ahimsa par aadhaarit loktantr hoga xxrep 6 ; sampurna ahimsa ke aadhaar par sangathit or chalane vaala koi samaaj shuddh araajaktaa Will be a society
 main ne bhi sweekaar kiya ki ek ahimsak rajya main bhi police bal kii jarurat anivaary ho sakati he
 Police ranks will be formed from those who believe in non-violence

shram or puunji tathaa hadataalon ke bive hinsak jhagade bahut kam honge or ahimsak rajyon main to bahut kam honge kyonki ahimsak samaaj kii bahulata kaa prabhaav samaaj main pramukh tatwon kaa sammaan karne ke liye mahaan hoga
 Similarly, there will be no room for communal disorder xxrep 6 ; 
 In the times of peace and disorder, an army like armed soldiers ahimsaatmak kaary unka yah kartavya hoga ki ve vijay dilaane vaale samudaayon ko ekajute karen jisamen shanti kaa prasar, tathaa aisi gatividhiyon kaa samavesh ho jo kisi bhi vyakti ko uske carch athwa khand main sampark banaae rakhte hue apane saath mila len
 This type of Saina should be prepared to fight any emergency and should also have sufficient strength of soldiers to die to calm the anger of the mob; xxrep 4 ; Up to the city can be organized in each block of buildings
 If non-violent society is attacked, then two paths of non-violence open
 adhikaar paane ke liye hamalavar se sahyog na karen balki samarpan karne kii apeksha mrityu ko gale lagaana pasand karen
 The other way would be to have non-violent resistance by people who have been trained in a non-violent way 


 Men and women love to die easily instead of surrendering to the will of the attacker on the endless paths of this unexpected performance and finally : He and his military bravery must melt before the xxrep 4 ; aise kisi desh athwa samooh jisane anhinsa ko apni antim niti bana liya he use parmaanu bam bhi apana das nahin bana saktaa he
 In that country, the level of non-violence passes happily, then it naturally increases so much that it has universal respect milane lagata he
 In line with these ideas, in 1940, when the invasions by Nazi Germany on the British islands appeared imminent, Gandhiji asked the British to follow the following policy of non-violence in peace and war
 main aapse hathiyaar rakhane ke liye kahana pasand karuunga kyonki ye aapako athwa maanavtaa ko bachaane main bekaar hai
 You have to invite Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini that whatever they want from countries you call them your right
 yadi in sajjanon ko apane ghar par rahane kaa chayan karnaa he tab aapako unhen khaali karnaa hoga
 If they do not give you the easy way, then you will allow yourself, men to sacrifice women and children, but will refuse to bow down to your loyalty
 1946 main yuddh ke baad die gaye ek saakshaatkaar main unhone isse bhi aage ek vichaar kaa prastutikaran kiya
 The Jews should have given themselves to the butcher's knife
 unhen apane aap ko samudri chattaanon se samudr ke andar phank dena chahie tha
 Yet Gandhiji knew that such a level of non-violence would require unwavering faith and courage and for this he realized that it is not held by everyone
 isliye unhone prayek vyakti ko paraamarsh diya ki unhen ahimsa ko apane paas rakhane kii jarurat nahin he khaas taur par us samay jab ise kaayarta ke sangrakshan ke liye upyog main kiya gaya ho
 In his Satyagraha movement Gandhiji kept away people who were afraid to take up arms or felt their own inability to resist
 unhone likhaa ki main maanata hum ki jahaan darpok or hinsa main se kisi ek ko chunanaa ho to main hinsa ke paksh main apni raay duungaa
 i kept repeating the warning on every assembly till they realized that they had come under the authority of a non-destructive force which they had been in possession of before and they had been used to that experiment and believed He had nothing to do with non-violence and took up arms again

 In his childhood, Gandhi had the experience of eating meat
 aisa unki uttaradhikari jigyaasa ke kaaran hi tha jisamen uske utsahvardhak mitra shaikh mehtab kaa bhi yogadan tha
 The idea of vegetarianism was deeply ingrained in Hindu and Jain practices of India and most Hindus in their homeland Gujarat were vegetarian
 isi tarah jain bhi the
 Gandhi's family was also not untouched by this
 padhai ke liye landan aane se purv gandhi ji ne apni mata putalibai or apane chachaa becharji swami se ek vaayada kiya tha ki ve maance khaane, sharaab pine se tathaa sankinta se dur rahenge
 He fasted to keep his promises and by doing so, the evidence was found which could not be found by having food, he had gained the basis for his lifetime philosophy
 jaise jaise gandhi ji vyask hote gaye ve purnataya shaakaahaari ban gaye
 He has also written The Moral Basis of Vegetarianism and many articles on the subject, some of which have also been published in The Vegetarian, a publication of the London Vegetarian Society
 gandhi ji swayan is avadhi main bahut si mahaan vibhootiyon se prerit hue or landan vegeterian sosayadi ke chayarmen dow0 josia oldfield ke mitra ban gaye
 Henry Stephen Salt | After reading and praising the works of Henry Stephen Salt, young Mohandas Gandhi met and corresponded with the vegetarian preacher
 gandhi ji ne landan main rahete samay or uske baad shaakaahaari bhojan kii vakaalat karne main kaaphi samay bitaayaa
 Gandhiji said that vegetarian food not only fulfills the needs of the body but it also serves the economic purpose which is made of meat and yet meat is more expensive than grains, vegetables and fruits
 iske alaava kai bhartiya jo aay kam hone kii vajah se sangharsh kar rahe the, us samay jo shaakaahaari ke rup main dikhaai de rahe the vah aadhyatmik parampara hi nahin vyaavhaarikta ke kaaran bhi tha

 Gandhiji used to make fruit from the beginning, but started drinking goat's milk on the advice of his doctor
 He never used to consume milk-products because earlier he believed that milk is not a natural diet of man and he was fed with cow's milk
 Chitkaar Seghrina was, and the most important reason was the oath which he made to his late mother
 jab gandhi ji solah saal ke hue tab unke pitashri kii tabiyat bahut karaab thi unke pita kii beemaari ke dauraan ve hameshaa upasthit rahete the kyonki ve apane mata-pita ke prati atyant samarpit the

 This decision was completely influenced by the philosophy of Brahmacharya
 Spiritual and practical purity is largely associated with celibacy and disinterestedness
 Gandhi saw celibacy as the primary basis for getting closer to God and identifying himself in his autobiography
 The childhood bride tells her libido and Ishrya's struggles with Kasturba
 She realized that this person They have a duty to remain celibate so that they can learn the love of lust instead
 For Gandhi, celibacy meant "control of thoughts, words and actions within the senses"
 gandhi ji kaa maananaa tha ki agar ek vyakti samaaj seva main karyrat he to use saadhaaran jivan kii or hi badhanaa chahie jise ve brahmacharya ke liye aavashyak maanate the
 unki saadagi ne pashchami jivan style ko tyaagane par majaboor karne laga or ve dakshin africa main failane lage the ise ve "khud ko shunaya ke sthiti main laana" kehete hai jisame anaavashyak kharch, saadhaaran jivan style ko apnaanaa or apane vastra swayan dhonaa aavashyak he

 Gandhi used to wear silence one day a week
 He believed that by refraining from speaking, he gets inner peace
 This influence of Hindu silence theory on him, and he used to contact others by writing on paper on those days, for three and a half years from the age of 37, Gandhiji refused to read newspapers, in response to which he said The steady state of the world today has confused him more than his own inner turmoil
 jon ruskin kii antu dis last, padhne ke baad unhone apane jivan style main parivartan karne kaa faisla kiya tathaa ek samudaay banaaya jise amarpakshi avasthaapan kaha jaataa tha
 After returning from South Africa, where he had completed advocacy and was associated with wealth and success, he renounced western-style clothes
 He accepted the clothes worn by India's poorest man, and Gandhi also advocated wearing home-made clothes
 Gandhi and his followers adopted the practice of weaving their own clothes through cotton and others like it
 Encouraged to work
 Although Indian workers were often lazy due to unemployment, they often bought their clothes from industrial manufacturers intended to serve British interests
 Gandhi's opinion was that if Indians started making their own clothes, it would be an economic shock to the British settled in India
 Consequently, the charkha was later included in the Indian national flag
 To reflect their ordinary life he later wore a dhoti for the rest of his life gandhi kaa janm hindu dharm main hua, unke puure jivan main adhiktar siddhanton kii utpati hindutv se hua
 Like ordinary Hindus, they believed in all religions equally, and so they rejected all arguments and efforts for conversion

 Gandhi believed that truth and love are at the core of every religion
 unka kahana he ki 'quran', 'bible', 'jend-avesta', 'talmud', athwa 'gita' kisi bhi madhyam se dekhie, ham sabakaa ishwar ek hi he, or vah satya tathaa prem swaroop he
 He also questioned questions about hypocrisy, hypocrisy etc
 on the principles of all religions

 Some of his comments with reference to various religions are as follows: baad main unase jab poocha gaya ki kya tum hindu ho, unhone kaha: Despite having deep respect for each other, Gandhi and Rabindranath Thakur engaged in a long debate more than once
 ye vaad-vivaad donon ke darshanik matbhed ko darshaate hai
 Both of them were famous Indian thinkers of that time

 This crisis of Bihar is only going to destroy the body, but the untouchability-borne crisis is destroying our souls

 On January 25 too, he inspired people to abandon untouchability as a great sin in the context of this incident, and on January 26, at a reception organized by traders in Madura, he said that i am believing that this misfortune on us is due to untouchability
 Has come as a result of this enormity
 main aapse vinati karata hoon ki aap meri baat par man hi man hans kar aisa na sochen ki main to aapke andhvishwaas kii vritti ko jagaa rahaa hoon
 i am not doing anything like this
 


 main bhale hi andhvishwasi kaha jaaon, lekin jis baat ko main apane hriday kii gaharaai main mahasoos kar rahaa hoon, use aapse kahe bina rah nahin saktaa
 


 If you believe in this thing like me, then you will be quick to take decisions and believe that the practice of untouchability like we practice today is not in the Hindu scriptures
 aap mere is vichaar se sahamat honge ki kisi bhi manushya ko asprishy maananaa ek bhayankar paap he
 Man's ego tells him that he is superior to other people

 If i use that faith to condemn my opponents because of my gross ignorance, then surely such belief will become a degenerate superstition

 ve mujhe tukdon main kaat sakate hai par mujhe us chiz ke liye raji nahin kar sakate jise main galat samajhataa hoon hamen aas nahi chhodni chahie, iske baavjood ki khyaali bate ho rahi hai ki hamen musalamaanon ko apane prem ke kaid main ablambit kar lenaa chahie
 Nevertheless, Jack Homer, noting Gandhi's long correspondence with Jinnah about the subject of Pakistan, says- "although Gandhi was personally against partition, he suggested a consensus under which the Congress and the Muslim League would form the provisional government
" Get your freedom by compromising below, after which the question of partition will be decided by the opinion of the districts where the number of Muslims Is good "
 Keeping this dual position on the subject of partition of India, Gandhi opened up the dimensions of criticism from both Hindus and Muslims
 mohammad ali jinna tathaa samakaleen pakistaniyon ne gandhi ko muslmaan rajnatik haq ko kam kar aankane ke liye ninda kii
 Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and his associates condemned Gandhi and alleged that he is politically engaged in persuading Muslims and that he is negligent about the atrocities on Hindus and has approved the creation of Pakistan
 It is still politically controversial today, as pakistani-american historian Ayesha Jalal argues that Gandhi and the Congress were not willing to share power with the Muslim League because of the partition, for example Hindu nationalist politician Pravin Togadia also Criticizing the leadership about the subject, it also indicates that the extreme weakness of their part led to the partition of India
 gandhi ne 1930 ke ant-ant main vibhaajan ko lekar israel ke nirmaan ke liye philistin ke vibhaajan ke prati bhi apni aruchi jaahir kii thi
 On 26 October 1938, he said in Harijan: mujhe kai patr praapt hue jiname mujhase poocha gaya ki main ghoshit karun ki germany main yahudiyon ke utpedan or arab-yahudiyon ke bare main kya vichaar rakhata hoon 
 aisa nahi ki is kathin prashn par apane vichaar main bina jhijak ke de paaungaa
 meri sahanubhuti yahudion ke saath he
 i am closely acquainted with them from South Africa, some have become my companions for life
 in mitron ke dwaara hi mujhe lambey samay se ho rahe utpedan ke bare main jaankaree mili
 ve isai dharm ke achhut rahe hai par meri sahanubhuti mujhe nyaay kii aavashyaktaa se vivekshunya nahi karti yahudiyon ke liye ek raashtra kii duhai mujhe zyada aakarshith nahi karti
 jisaki manjuuri bibal main di gayi or jis jid se ve apni vaapasi main philistin ko chaahane lage hai
 Why don't they love the other people of the earth, make the country their home where they were born and where they live
 philistin arabon kaa hai, thik usee tarah jis tarah inland angrejon kaa or france francision kaa
 yahudiyon ko arabon par adhiropit karnaa anuchit or amanviya he jo kuch bhi aaj philistin main ho rahaa hai use kisi bhi aachaar samhita se sahi sabit nahi kiya ja saktaa
 Those who wanted to gain independence through violence also came under the grip of a little political fire because of their criticism of Gandhi, his refusal against the hanging of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Udam Singh, Rajguru caused his condemnation in some parties
 is aalochana ke liye gandhi ne kaha,"ek aisa samay tha jab log mujhe suna karte the kii kis tarah angrejo se bina hathiyaar ladaa ja saktaa he kyonki tab hathyaar nahi the
 

 But today i am told that my non-violence is of no use because it cannot stop the riots of hindu-muslims, so one should be armed for self-defense
 " unhone apni bahes kai lekho main kii, jo kii homer jacks ke da gandhi reader: ek strot unke lekhnee or jivan kaa 
 1938 main jab pehali baar "yahudeevaad or semetisam virdohi" likhi gai, gandhi ne 1930 main hue germany main yahudiyon par hue utpedan ko satyagrah ke antargat bataaya unhone germany main yahudiyon dwaara sahe gaye kathinaaiyon ke liye ahimsa ke tareeke ko istemaal karne kii peshkash yah kehete hue kii If i had been a Jew and had been born in Germany and had been earning my living from there, considering that Germany would be my home, that a decent German would threaten me to shoot me or throw me into a dark chamber, i would tread and disparate i will refuse to be subjected to
 And for this, i will wait for the Jewish brothers to come and join me in my legal impunity, rather i am confident that in the end all will be compelled to accept my example
 If the recipe given here is accepted by a single Jew or all Jews, then their situation will not be worse than what it is today
 And if they willingly bear the given pain, it will give them inner strength and pleasure and Hitler's deliberate violence is also extracted as a simple genocide of the Jews and this will be the first answer against the declaration of his atrocities
 ishvar kaa bhay rakhane vaale, mrityu ke aatank se nahi darate
 Gandhi's statements received a lot of criticism for which he answered in the "question on Jews" article, along with his friends criticizing my appeal to the Jews
 Told the remedy of injustice against him, he is not new
 


meraa keval yah nivedan hai ki agar hriday se hinsa ko tyaag de to nishkarshtah vah abhyaas se ek shakti srujit karegaa jo ki bade tyaag ki vajah se he
 He responded to the criticisms in "answers to Jewish Friends" and "jews and Palestine", stating that "I asked for a renunciation of violence from the heart that would in practice create a power that is due to great sacrifice
" yahudiyon kii asann aahuti ko lekar gandhi ke bayaan ne kai tikaakaron kii aalochana ko aakarshith kiya
 Martin Buber, himself an opponent of the Jewish state, wrote a sharply critical letter to Gandhi on 24 February 1939
 Buber asserted that the treatment of Indian people by the British was different from the treatment of Jews by the Nazis, in addition, while the Indians were victims of persecution, Gandhi on some occasions supported the use of force
 
 gandhi ne 1930 main germany main yahudiyon ke utpedan ko satyagrah ke bheetar hi sandarbhit kaha
 In November 1938, he suggested a measure of non-violence for Nazi persecution of uprooted Jews: abhas hota he ki yahudiyon ke german utpedan kaa itihaas main koi saamanantar nahi
 puraane jamaane ke taanashaah kabhi itane pagal nahi hue jitna ki hitler hua or ise ve dharmik utsaah ke saath karte hai ki vah ek aise anany dharm or jangi raashtra ko prastut kar rahaa he jiske naam par koi bhi amanviyata maanviyata kaa niyam ban jaati he jise abhi or bhavishya main puruskrit kiya jaayegaa
 jaahir si baat he ki ek pagal parantu nidar yuva dwaara kiya gaya aparaadh sari jati par avishwasaneey ugrata ke saath padegaa
yadi kabhi koi nyaaysangat yuddh maanavtaa ke naam par, to ek puri com ke prati germany ke dheeth utpedan ke khilaaf yuddh ko purna rup se uchit kaha ja saktaa hai
 But i do not believe in any war
 It is not in my jurisdiction to discuss the pros and cons of war
 parantu germany dwaara yahudiyon par kiye gaye is tarah ke aparaadh ke khilaaf yuddh nahi kiya ja saktaa to germany ke saath gathbandhan bhi nahi kiya ja saktaa yah kaise ho saktaa hai ki aise deshon ke bich gathbandhan ho jisame se ek nyaay or prajatantr kaa daawa karata hai or doosraa jise donon kaa dushman ghoshit kar diya gaya he?" Gandhi's early writings on South Africa are quite controversial
 On March 7, 1908, Gandhi wrote in the Indian Opinion about his prison life in South Africa "kafirs are rude in governance - even more as prisoners
 They are annoying
" , Dirty and live almost like animals
 " 1903 main apravas ke vishay ko lekar gandhi ne tippanee kii ki "main maanata hoon ki jitna ve apni jati kii shuddhta par vishwaas karte hai utana ham bhi

 gandhi ke in kathanon ne unhen kuch logon dwaara nasalwadi hone ke aarope ko lagane kaa mauka diya he

 Bhana and Wahed have commented on the events surrounding the unveiling in The Making of a Political Reformer: Gandhi in South Africa, 1913–1914
 anubhag " dakshin africa ke liye gandhi ke viraasat" main ve likhte hai " gandhi ne dakshin africa ke sakriy kaaryakartaaon ke aane vaali pidhiyon ko shwet adhipaty ko khatm karne ke liye prerit kiya
 This legacy connects him to Nelson Mandela

 esaem pandey ne ise bharat ke ahir krishak varg kaa rashtriya mahakavy kaha he
 Lorikayan, or the legend of Lorik, is a proverb of Bhojpuri language
 ise ahir jati kii ramayana kaa darja diya jaataa he
 There are many small states in Loriki, which are of Ahirs, Rajputs and Adivasis and these people often have wars for livestock, Bhoomdhan, feminine and power

 The stories of Lorik and Chanda have an important place in the folk literature of Hindi
 14ve shatabdi ke purv se hi loric va chanda kii kathae hindi sahitya main darj he
 Sufi poet Maulana Dawood chose the folk epic of Lorik and Chanda in 1379 to write the first Hindavi love poem called 'chandayan'
 moulana kaa maananaa tha ki 'chandaayan' ek divya satya he tathaa isaki shrutiyaan, quran kii aayaton ke samatuly he
 
 loric - katha kaa ullekh iliyat ne bhi kiya he tathaa unhone is sandarbh main ahir jati kaa pramanik itihaas bhi diya he
 The story of Lorik is not only a folk tale, but literary works based on it also exist

 In ancient times the Raniwas of Hindu kings was called Antanpur
 yahi mughalon ke jamaane main 'janaankhaana' yaa 'haram' kahalaaya
 There were also other names of Antipur which were commonly used as synonyms, such as Shuddhanta and Barika

 In mathematics, the concept of permutation is used in subtly different meanings, all meanings related to the action of permutation of objects or value
 anaupchaarik rup se, kuch maanon ke ek set ko vishesh kram main vyavasthit karnaa kramchay he
 Thus there are six permutations of the set namely xxrep 4 , and
 bijganit main or vishesh rup se samooh siddhant main, set s kaa kramchay s se swany main dvibhajan ke rup main paribhaashit he 
 aise nakshe ke liye f kaa sambandh s kii us punarvyavastha se he jisamen s tatv apane bimb f kaa sthaan le letaa he
 In combinatorics, the permutation of a finite set s is defined as the listed rearrangement of its elements
 is arth main, s kaa kramchay uske tatwon kii punarvyavastha se bhinn he
 For the initial order set S, such as s =, these two meanings are almost recognizable: Applying a permutation in the first sense to this initial order gives an alternate sequence of elements, which is a permutation in the second sense
 kisi vastu ke bhaagon kii punarvyavastha ke kaary ko, yaa usase praapt parinaam ko namit karne ke liye anaupchaarik rup se kramparivartan shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Thus the alphabet of a word can also be defined as a permutation of its characters, or say x 3Y + 7 + y 2Z is a permutation of terms of the polynomial x 3Y + y 2Z +7
 kramparivartan ke kaary ko pratikon kaa pratisthaapan bhi kaha ja saktaa he, udhaaharan ke liye jab kehete hai ki X, Y, z kii char raashi ke kramparivartan dwaara x 3Y +Y 2Z +7 se y 3Z +Z 2X +7 praapt hota he
 These statements can be given precise meaning keeping in mind an appropriate symmetric collective action
 combinetorics main "kramparivartan" ke duusare arth ko kabhi kabhi vistrut kiya jaataa he
 In primary combinatorics, "permutation and conjunction" refers to two related problems, both of which depend on the probability of selecting a specific k element from a set of n elements, the order of selection for the k permutation is taken into account, But is ignored for k-combinations
 darasal k -kramparivartan kii gananaa kaa prayog k -sangyojan ke number { \ displaystyle { \ tbinom {n}{k}}} kii gananaa kii disha main ek kadam ke rup main kiya jaataa he or set ke kramparivartan kii sankhya n ! kii gananaa ke rup main bhi hota he
 However k-permutations do not correspond to such permutations unless k = n, that is, the selection includes all available elements
 To broaden the notion of permutation differently, one can start with a finite multiset m in place of a set S, in which some values occur more than once
 The permutation of m is a sequence of elements of m each of which occurs exactly as many times as in M
 Thus for m =, the sequence of is a multiset permutation of M, but is not
 lagbhag ganit ke prayek kshetra main, kramparivartan kamobesh pramukh rup se hote hai
 They are generated by applying different sequences to a finite set, possibly because we want to find out how many configurations are thus identified, ignoring such a sequence

 n The rule for determining the number of permutations of an object was available in Hindu culture around 1150: there is a passage in Lilavati by Indian mathematician Bhaskar which translates ikai se shuru or vriddhimaan or kai sthanon ke liye jari ankaganitiya shrinkhalaa ke bahugunan kaa utpaada, vishisht sankhya vaale ankon kaa roopaantar hoga
 The first case of the first study of unrelated mathematical questions with the help of permutations appeared in 1770, when Joseph Louis lagrange, studying polynomial equations, found that the properties of the permutation of the origin of the equation are related to the probabilities of solving it
 is kaary se hue vikaas kaa parinaam everis galva, ke kaam ke madhyam se, galva siddhant main pratipaadit hua, jo mul dwaara bahupadiy samikarnon ko hal karne main sambhav or asambhav kaa puraa vivaran detaa he
 There are many similar situations in modern mathematics, where the study of related permutations is required to understand the problem
 kramparivartan kii sankalpana kaa prayog nimnlikhit sandarbhon main kiya jaataa he
 In group theory and related fields, there is also a permutation of random sets, infinite
 s kaa swany main dvibhajan set s kaa kramparivartan he
 This permits permutation, which defines groups of permutations
 agar n tatwon kaa parimit set s he, to n ! s kaa kramparivartan he
 In combinatorics, a permutation usually means a sequence consisting of each element once and only once from a finite set
 anukram kii avadharana set se is tarah alag he ki usamen anukram ke tatv ek kram main hote he: anukram kaa pehla tatv hota he, doosraa tatv or isi prakaar kramshah hote chale jate hai
 Conversely, there is no order of elements in a set, and there are different ways of representing the same set
 is arth main n tatwon ke parimit s set kaa kramparivartan se s main dvibhajan, yaa s ke puure kram ke liye chayan ke tulya he
 In this sense, n! The permutation is also of S
 "kramparivartan" shabd kaa ek kamjor arth bhi he jo kabhi-kabhaar praathmik combinetorics granthon main prayog kiya jaataa he, un kramon ko namoddhisht karte hue jinamein koi tatv ek se adhik baar na aae, kintu nirdhaarit set ke sabhi tatwon ke prayog kii aavashyaktaa na pade

 These items are also known as non-repetitive sequences, a term that avoids confusion with other, more common meanings of "permutation"
 n ke aakaar ke ek set kii tatwon ke bina doharaav ke k kram kii lambaai kii sankhya he a number known as the k -th depreciable divisional power of n and with many other names and notations prevalent
 agar m ek parimit multiset he, to ek multiset kramparivartan m tatwon kaa kram he jisamen prayek tatv utani baar prakat hota he jitani baar m main isaki bahulata he
 If the plurality of elements of m is m 1 { \ displaystyle m_ {1}}, m 2 { \ displaystyle m_ {2}}, 


, ml { \ displaystyle m_ {l}} and their sum is n, then m The number of multiset permutations of is given by the polynomial coefficient samooh siddhant main, ek set ke kramparivartan kaa arth he ek dwibhajit nakshaa, yaa us set se swany main dvibhajan
 kisi bhi set s ke sabhi kramparivartan, nakshe kii utpaada ke rup main or pahchaan kii tatasth tatv ke rup main sanrachana vaale samooh banaate hai
 It is a isometric group of S
 samarupata tak, yah samametiya samooh set kii gananeeyata par nirbhar karata he, isliye s tatwon kii prakruti samooh kii sanrachana ke liye apraasangik he
 Symmetric groups have been studied most in the case of finite sets, in which case it can be assumed that s = {1,2, 


, {0} n} for some natural number n, which is n Defines the isometric group of degrees
 samametiya samooh ke kisi bhi upasamooh ko kramparivartan samooh kehete he
 In fact according to Kelly's formula any group corresponds to a permutation group and each finite group is a subgroup of any finite symmetric group
 haalanki, kramparivartan samoohon kii amoort kramparivartan samoohon kii tulana main adhik sanrachana hoti he or kramparivartan samooh ke rup main vibhinn pratiti hoti he isliye samatuly hone kii zarurat nahin he
 There are two main notation methods for permutation of a finite s set
 do-panktiyon vaale ankan main, ek pehali pankti main s ke tatv ko soochibaddh karti he or prayek ke liye kramparivartan ke tahat apane bimb ko duusari pankti main
 udhaaharan ke liye set kaa vishesh kramparivartan is rup main likhaa ja saktaa he: This means that σ satisfies σ = 2, σ = 5, σ = 4, σ = 3 and σ = 1
 vaikalpik rup se, ham chakra ankan kaa upyog kar kramparivartan likh sakate hai, jo kramparivartan ke safal prayog ke prabhaav par kendrit karata he
 It expresses the permutation as the product of a cycle that corresponds to the orbitals of the permutation; Since discrete orbitals are relaxed, this is commonly called the "decomposition of loose cycles" of permutations
 yah is prakaar kaam karata he: s ke kuch x tatv se shuru karkeσ ≠ x, anukram likhte hai σ ke tahat kramik bimb kaa σ ) 


), jab tak bimb x na ho jaae, jis bindu par koshthak band kar die jate hai
 The set of values written forms the orbit of x and the parenthesized expression gives a corresponding cycle of σ
 to s ke x tatv ko chunanaa jari rahata he jo pehle se likhi gai kaksha main nahin he or kiσ ≠ y or sangat chakra ko likhte hai or yah kram jari rahata he jab tak s ke sabhi tatv likhe gaye chakra se sambhddha nahin hote hai yaa σ ke niyat bindu nahin hote
 chunki har nae chakra ke liye prarambh bindu alag alag tareekon se chunaa ja saktaa he, saamanytah ek hi kramparivartan ke liye kai alag alag chakra ankan hai; udhaaharan ke liye upar vaale main ek udhaaharan he Each cycle of σ is in itself a symbol of a permutation, that is, which takes an even value of σ in this orbit, drawing all the elements of s in themselves
 The l shape of the orbit is called the length of the circle
 σ kii pruthak kakshaen paribhaasha se shithil hai, to tadnurupi chakra roopantarit ho jate hai or σ iske chakron kaa utpaada he 
 isliye chakra ankan main chakra ke sangyojan kii kramparivartan kii sanrachana ke ankan ke rup main vyakhya kii ja sakati he, jis kaaran se kramparivartan kaa naam "apghaton"
 yah apghaton anivaary rup se adwitiya he: utpaada main chakron ke punarkram ke alaava, σ ko chakron ke utpaada ke rup main likhane kaa koi tarika nahin he jisaki kakshaen shithil hon
 chakra ankan kam adwitiya he kyonki prayek chakra alag alag tareekon se likhaa ja saktaa he, jaisaa ki uparokt udhaaharan main diya gaya he jahaan jaise chakra ko nirupit karata he kintu ek alag kramparivartan ko nirupit karegaa)
 Shape is not a corresponding circle of a class of 1, since this permutation will fix x as well as every other element of S, in other words it will be identified, independently of x
 It is possible to include the cycle notation so that σ gives the force that σ determines x, but does not correspond to the factor in decomposition of σ
 agar "chakra" kii avadharana main kramparivartan kii pahchaan shaamil karen, to isse shithil chakron main kramparivartan ke apghaton kii adwitiyata nasht ho jaaegi
 pahchaan kramparivartan kaa shithil chakron main apghaton khaali utpaada he; iskaa chakra ankan khaali hoga, isliye isaki bajaae e jaisi ankan paddati istemaal kii jaaegi
 Two cycles of length are called substitutions; Such permutations replace only two elements
 do kramparivartan kaa utpaada kaary ke rup main unki sanrachana ke rup main paribhaashit he, duusare shabdon main σ·π vah kaary he jo set ke kisi bhi x tatv kaa σ ) main chithran karata he
 Note that the rightmost permutation applies to the first argument because of the way the application of the task is written
 kuch lekhak pehle sabase baayen kaarak ko lagu karnaa pasand karte hai, par uske liye kramparivartan unke tark kii daayin ore likhaa janaa chahie, udaahranarth pratipadak ke rup main, x par lagu σ x σ likhaa jaataa he; to utpaada paribhaashit kiya gaya he x σ ·π =π ke dwaara
 haalanki yah kramparivartan guna karne ke liye ek alag niyam detaa he; yah lekh vahaan paribhaasha kaa upyog karata he jahaan sabase daaen kramparivartan ko pehle lagu kiya jaataa he
 Since the structure of two bisections always gives another bisector, the product of two permutations is again a permutation
 kaary sanrachana sahyogaatmak hoti he, isliye kramparivartan par utpaada sanchaalan he:·ρ =σ ·
 isliye kramparivartan ke utpaada aamtaur par koshthak ke bina likhe jate hai or ve aamtaur par ek dot yaa utpaada ko chihnit karne vaale anya nishaan ke bhi bina likhe jate hai The identity permutation, which characterizes each element of the set itself, is the neutral element of this product
 do panktiyon vaale ankan main, pahchaan he Since there are inverses of bisectors, so are the permutations of and the inverse of σ is σ −1 which is again a permutation
 spasht rup se, jab bhi σ =y ek kaa σ −1=x bhi he
 In two-line notation, the inverse can be obtained by interchanging two lines, e
g
 chakra ankan main prayek chakra main tatwon ke kram ko palatney se iske vyutkram ke liye chakra ankan praapt kar sakate hai
 a collaborative product groups a set of all permutations of s from a neutral element and inversely to all its elements, which is called a symmetric group of S
 ek parimit set ke prayek kramparivartan ko pratisthaapan ke utpaada ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 In addition, although many types of expressions may exist for a given permutation, there cannot be an expression with both even and odd number of substitutions between them
 All permutations are classified as even or odd, according to the parity of their substitutions in any expression
 chakra ankan main likhe kramparivartan guna kii vidhi kathin he or utpaada ke chakra sanrachit kiye ja rahe kramparivartan se puri tarah alag ho sakate hai
 However the cycle structure is preserved in the special case of the conjugation of π to the other permutation of the permutation of σ, which means the creation of the product π · σ · π −1
 Here the cycle notation of the result can be obtained by taking the cycle notation of σ and applying π to all its entries
 {1, 2, 


,{0}n} ke kramparivartan kaa n ×n matrix ke rup main pratinidhitiv kiya ja saktaa he
 There are two natural ways of doing this, but only for one is the multiplication of the matrix corresponding to the multiplication of the permutation in the same order: that is, which is the associate of the σ matrix m whose m i, j entry is 1 if i = σ Otherwise 0
 There is exactly 1 entry of the resulting matrix in each column and one in each row
 Such a matrix is called a permutation matrix
 combinetorics main n tatwon ke saath set s kaa kramparivartan kisi kram main s ke tatwon kii suchi he
 It can be defined as a formal bisection from set to S
 dhyaan den ki yadi s ke baraabar he to yah paribhaasha samooh siddhant kii paribhaasha se mail khaati he
 Usually any set equipped with a sequence of elements can be used instead
 combinetoric kaa gun jo kramparivartan kii samooh saidhantik vyakhya se sambandhit he or jise s ke kul kram kaa upyog kiye bina paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he, vah kramparivartan σ kii chakra sanrachana he
 This is the division of σ describing the length of cycles of n
 yahan σ ke har tay bindu ke liye vibhaajan main bhaag "1" he
 a permutation that has no fixed point is called a dislocation
 anya combinetorics ke gun sidhe s ke kram se sambandhit he or jis tarah se kramparivartan isse sambandhit ho
 is tarah ke kai gun hai
 The ascension of the permutation of σ of n is i σ i +1, so each i with 1 ≤ i { \ displaystyle 1 \ leq i} is either the ascension or descent of σ
 k aaroh ke saath n ke kramparivartan kii sankhya ilurian sankhya ⟨ n k ⟩ { \ displaystyle \ textstyle \ left \ langle {n \ atop k} \ right \ rangle } he, yah bhi k aaroh ke saath n ke kramparivartan kii sankhya he
 a permutation ascending run is a full incremental proximal sequence of permutations that can be extended from both sides, corresponding to the maximum sequence of successive ascensions
 udhaaharan ke liye, kramparivartan 2453167 ke arohi ran 245, 3 or 167 he, jabaki iskaa ek vriddhimaan parinaam 2367 he
 If a permutation has k - 1 descending runs, then it must be the union of the k ascending runs
 Therefore the permutation of n is the same with the ascending run as the number of permutations with ascending k - 1 ⟨nk - 1⟩ { \ displaystyle \ textstyle \ left \ langle {n \ atop k-1} \ right \ rangle} 
 kramparivartan σ kaa vyutkram sthitiyon kii jodi he jisamen kramparivartan kii pravishtiyanulat kram main hai: i { \ displaystyle i} or σ i > σ j { \ displaystyle \ sigma _{i}> \ sigma _{j}} 
 to ek avarohi sirf do asann sthitiyon par ek vyutkram maatr he
 For example, the permutation σ = 23154 has three inversions:,,, pairs of entries,, for
 kabhi kabhi ek vyutkram ko aise mulya ke jode ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jiskaa kram ulat he, isse vyutkram kii sankhya ke liye koi antar nahin padataa or yah joda bhi uparyukt arth main σ −1 ulat kramparivartan kaa vyutkram he
 The number of inversions is an important measure for the degree for which the entries of the permutation are out of order, the same for σ and σ −1
 k vyutkram vaale kramparivartan ko vvayavasthit karne ke liye, asann pratisthaapan ko kramik rup se lagu karke, sadaiv sambhav he or aise prachaalanon ke k anukram kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Also any proper choice of adjacent substitutions will work: it is sufficient to choose the substitution of i at every step and where i + 1 i is the descending of the refined permutation so far
 k vyutkram ke saath n ke kramparivartan kii sankhya mahonian sankhya ke dwaara vyakt kii jaati he, yah utpaada ke vistaar main x k kaa gunank he Called q -value q! also known as
 is khand main, set s kaa k -kramparivartan s ke k vishisht tatwon kaa vyavasthit anukram he
 For example, the set of given characters {{1} C, E, G, I, N, R}, the sequence ICE is a 3-permutation, RING and RICE is a 4-permutation, NICER and REIGN are 5-permutations and CRINGE Is a 6-permutation; Since the latter uses all characters, it is a permutation of a given set in the simple combinatorial sense
 n ko s kaa aakaar hone den, chayan ke liye uplabdh tatwon kii sankhya
 Be received
 isse vishesh rup se n -kramparivartan kii sankhya praapt hoti he yaa isi tarah ke ankan se dyotak hoti he
 That marking is rarely used in contexts other than counting k-permutations, but expressions for numbers arise in many other situations
 haalanki kai anya naam or ankan upyog main hai, jaise ki pochhammer pratik main vistrut hai
 When k ≤ n the factorial power can be met by additional factors: nk ×! daahine haath kii ore aksar k -kramparivartan kii sankhya ke liye abhivyakti ke rup main di jaati he lekin iskaa mukhya gun compact bhajya ankan kaa upyog karnaa he
 In those cases the number of k-permutations is nk bus 0
 n ke kramparivartan kaa pratinidhitiv 0 ≤ n < n ! ke saath n purnank dwaara kiya ja saktaa he, basharte ki anukram ke rup main sankhya or kramparivartan ke saamaanya pratinidhitiv ke bich roopaantaran ke liye suvidhajanak vidhiyaan pradaan kii ja rahi hon
 Is particularly attractive when n is small enough that n can be captured in the word machine; For 32-bit words it means n ≤ 12 and for 64-bit words it means n ≤ 20
 lehmar code main kramparivartan σ ke liye, sankhya d n pehle pad σ 1 ke liye kiye gaye chunaav kaa pratinidhitiv karti he, sankhya d n −1 pratinidhitiv karti he duusare pad σ 1 ke liye set ke sheshason − 1 tatwon ke bich kiye gaye chunaav kaa or isi prakaar aage bhi
 or spasht shabdon main, prayek d n +1−i shesh tatwon kii sankhya detaa he jo pad σ i se nishchit rup se kam hoti he
 Since those remaining elements are bound to come in the form of a posterior term σ j, the digit dn + 1 − i counts the inverse by adding i as a small index
 The inverse table for σ is quite similar, but here the number of dn + 1 − k inverse counts where k = σ j occurs as the minimum of the two values displayed in the reverse order
 Both notations can be visualized by an n in the n Roth diagram with the point symbol of the entries of the permutation and the cross symbol of the inverse; By the definition of the inverse, the cross falls into any square that is both before the point in its column and the point in its row
 lehmar code uttarotar panktiyon main croson kii sankhya ko soochibaddh karata he, jabaki vyutkram talika uttarotar stambhon main croson kii sankhya ko soochibaddh karti he; vyutkram kramparivartan ke liye lehmar code he or lehmar code ke liye vyutkram kramparivartan
 To effectively convert the Lehmer code dn, dn −1, 


, d 2, d 1 into a permutation of a systematic s set, one can start with a list of elements of s in incremental order and i
 For 1, increase the n listed σ i from the elements listed in which other dn + 1 − i occur first and remove that element from the list
 To convert the inverse table dn, dn −1, 


, d 2, d 1 into a corresponding permutation, insert the number from d 1 to dn from the largest to the smallest elements of s in an initially empty sequence
 Can be reversed; Using the number d from the inverse table in step, the elements of s in the sequence are inserted at the point where the already existing d elements preceded it
 Alternatively, both the insertion table and the elements of s can be processed in reverse order, uttarotar prakritik sankhya ke bhajya sankhya pranali main safal parivartan se ye anukram koshgat kram main utpann hote hai or inhen aage kramparivartan main parivartit karne se mulank kram sangrakshit rahata he basharte ki lehmar code kii vyakhya kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he pratinidhitiv bhajya sankhya pranali main sankhya ke yoga se kramparivartan ke vyutkram kii sankhya praapt hoti he or us yoga kii samta se kramparivartan ke chihnak praapt hote he
 Additionally, the position of zero in the inverse table gives the value of the left-to-right maximum of the permutation while the position of zero in the Lehmer code is the position of the right-to-left shortest; This allows computing the distribution of such lasts in all permutations
 lehmar code ke saath ek kramparivartan d n, d n−1, 


, d 2, d 1 ek arohan hamen − i agar or sirf agaridi ≥ di+1
 Computing may require generating a permutation of a sequence of given values
 yah karne kii sabase upyogi vidhi is baat par nirbhar karti he ki kuch, yadrichhik rup se chune gaye, kramparivartan, yaa sabhi kramparivartan apekshit he or baad ke maamle main yadi ek vishisht kram kii aavashyaktaa he
 Another question is whether the probabilistic similarity between entries in the given sequence is to be taken into account; If this is the case, specific multiset permutations of the sequence must be generated
 n ke kramparivartan ko utpann karne kaa ek spasht tarika he ki lehmar code ke liye mulya utpann kiye jaaen or unhen samroop kramparivartan main parivartit kiya jaae
 haalanki baad kaa charan bhale hi spasht he par kushalta se lagu karnaa kathin he kyonki iske liye ek yadrichhik sthiti par, ek sarini yaa shrankhlabaddh suchi ke rup main anukram ke pratyaksh pratinidhitiv ke anukram main se prayek chayan kii n sankriya or usase vilopan apekshit he; parivartan ke liye donon ke liye lagbhag n 2 / 4 sankriyaayein apekshit hai
 The probability of n being particularly small is not much of a problem, but it turns out that there are simple alternatives available for both random and systematic production that are more efficient
 is kaaran se yah upyogi prathit nahin hota he haalanki nishchit rup se sambhav he, ki aisi vishesh data sanrachana ko niojit kiya jaae jisase o samay main lehmar code kramparivartan main roopantaran kiya ja sake
 To generate a random permutation of a sequence of given n values, it does not matter whether a randomly chosen sequence of n is applied to the sequence or a random element is selected from the specific permutations of the sequence
 This is because, although in the case of recurring values, there may be specific permutations of n that derive the same permutation sequence, the number of such permutations is the same for each possible result
 suvyavasthit utpaadan ke vipareet jo n ! sankhya ke vikaas ke kaaran brihad n ke liye avyaavhaarik ban jaataa he, yah maan liye jane kaa koi kaaran nahin he ki yadrichhik utpaadan ke liye n chota hoga
 The basic idea of generating random permutations is to randomly place an n! The sequence which is of integers d 1, d 2, 


, dn has to produce a satisfactory 0 ≤ di <i and convert it into a permutation by means of bisector analogy
 parvarti saadrishy ke liye anukram kii lehmar code ke rup main vyakhya kii ja sakati he or isse praapt hoti he utpaadan kii vidhi jo ronaald e
 fisher or frank yets dwaara pehali baar 1938 main prakashit hui thi
 Computer implementation was not an issue at the time, this method leads to the difficulty depicted above in efficiently switching from Lehmer code to permutations
 bhinn dwibhajit saadrishyata kaa upyog karke iskaa hal nikaala ja saktaa he: kram ke shesh i tatwon main se d i ke prayog ke baad tatv kaa chayan karke, bajaae iske ki tatv ko hataaya jaae or tatwon ko ek sthaan aage karke anukram ko susambaddh banane se tatv ko antim shesh tatv pratisthapit kar detaa he
 Thus the remaining elements for selection form a chronological range at each point in time, even if they are not in the same order as if they were in the original sequence
 purnank ke anukram se kramparivartan kaa pratichitran kuch had tak jatil he, par tatkaal praveshan dwaara ise prayek kramparivartan thik ek tarah se utpann karte dekha ja saktaa he
 When the selected element is the last remaining element, the replacement operation can be omitted
