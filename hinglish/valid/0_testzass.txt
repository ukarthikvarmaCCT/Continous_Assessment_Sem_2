 ISO Code: srx hind-europea bhashaa-parivaar sansar kaa sabase bada bhashaa parivaar hai
 The indo-european language family includes hundreds of languages and dialects of the world

 All these languages are derived from the same primitive language, can give it the name of primitive-indo-european language
 yah sanskrit se bahut milti-julati thi, jaise ki vah saanskrit kaa hi aadim rup ho
 The features of these languages are that all ancient indo-european languages had many word-forms of noun, pronoun, adjective and verb, which showed their grammatical form in a sentence
 adhiktar ye shabd-rup shabd ke ant main pratyay dwaara banaaye jaati the 
 The words used for everyday things, relatives, common animals, verbs were very similar to each other in all the ancient languages of this family and on this basis linguists envisaged the primitive-indo-european language

 The table below gives some words from the common vocabulary of some ancient and new indo-european languages and the reconstructions of the presumed primitive indo-european

 The sub-branch of each branch and the main ancient and modern languages included in it and their main countries are given below
 hind europea shakhaon ko mukhyatah do virgon main rakhaa jaataa he : kentum varg or saatam varg
 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: kya, gy and ghya, changed to touch-struggling or struggling consonants, such as: ch, j, s and sh

 These include the Baltic, Slavic, indo-iranian, Armenian, and Albanian branches

 sanskrit shabd arya kaa matlab hota tha kuleen or sabhy
 That is why the old ritualists, such as Max Müller, named the primitive- and modern indo-european language-speaking castes as "arya"
 ye naam europea logon ko bahut pasand aayaa or jald hi sabhi europea vaasiyon ne apane apane deshon ko pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bataanaa shuru kar diya 
 Especially Hittler propagated that Germany is the birthplace of ancient Aryans and Arya means pure generation, whose skin is fair, long, eyes blue and hair golden
 hitlar ke anusaar german log hi sarvocch or sarvashaktimaan nasl ke hai or vishesh taur par yahudee log ghatiya nasl ke or anarya hai 
 The British publicized that around 1700 BC
 In the indo-aryan tribes, coming from Europe, invaded the Indus Valley and devastated the indigenous Indus Valley civilization of India and massacred its inhabitants and later made the remaining people slaves - who were enslaved and bandit in the Rigveda
 Having said 
 hitlar ke yahudee narsanhaar ke baad ab "arya" shabd kaa matlab bhashaai arth main lagaaya jaataa he, na ki nasl ke liye
 But historians and linguists are still searching for the birthplace of the Aryans

 At that time, the indus-valley civilization was destroyed either by earthquakes or by changes in the current of indus-saraswati rivers and due to drought
 ye vichaardhaara aajkal duniya ke adhiktam bhashavid or itihaaskaar maanate hai
 The "kurgan tomb-mounds" of Central Asia are believed to have been created by the ancient Aryans
 ek duusari vichaardhaara ke anusaar pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bharat hi he or yaheen se arya kabeeley europe or baaki asia main pravaas kiye
 This view is considered by many Indians and Hindutva-plaintiffs, but in the rest of the world, this view is not valued

 The experiences of the First World War, the unsatisfactory montague-chelmsford reforms reform of 1919 and the emerging influence of MK Gandhi in the Indian independence movement led to a remarkable change in the attitude of his leaders with regard to setting demands for civil rights
 unka dhyaan bharatiyon or angrejon ke bich samanta kaa adhikaar maangane se hat kar sabhi bharatiyon ke liye swatantraaa sunishchit karne par kendrit ho gaya
 The Commonwealth Bill of India prepared by Annie Besant in 1925 specifically demanded seven fundamental rights - personal freedom, freedom of conscience, freedom of expression, freedom to assemble, non-discrimination on the basis of gender , Compulsory primary education and freedom of use of public spaces
 1927 main, congress ne utpeedan ke khilaaf nigaraanee pradaan karne vaale adhikaron kii ghoshnaa ke aadhaar par, bharat ke liye swaraj samvidhan kaa masauda taiyaar karne ke liye ek samiti ke gathan kaa sankalp liya
 In 1928, an 11-member committee was formed under the leadership of Motilal Nehru
 apni report main samiti ne sabhi bharatiyon keliye mul adhikaron kii guarantee sahit anek siforishein kii thim
 These rights resembled the US Constitution and the rights adopted by European countries after the war, and many of them were adopted by the 1925 Bill

 is sankalp main prastaavit anya nae adhikaron main rajya ke swaamitv kaa nishedh, saarvbhaumik vayask matadhikaar, mrityudand kaa unmoolan tathaa avaagaman kii swatantraaa shaamil the
 In the draft resolution drafted by Jawaharlal Nehru, which later formed the basis of many Directive Principles, the primary responsibility for implementing social reforms was placed on the state and at the same time the signs of the growing influence of socialism and Gandhi philosophy on the freedom movement

 up samiti ne mul adhikaron kaa masauda taiyaar kiya or samiti ko april 1947 tak apni report prastut kar di or baad main usee maheene samiti ne isko sabha ke saamne prastut kar diya, jisamen agle varsh tak bahes or charchaaen huin tathaa disambar 1948 main adhikansh masaude ko sweekaar kar liya gaya
 The drafting of basic rights was influenced by the decisions made by the US Supreme Court in accepting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations Federation, the activities of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, as well as the interpretation of the Rights Bill in the US Constitution
 nideshak siddhanton kaa masaude, jise bhi mul adhikaron par bani up samiti dwaara hi taiyaar kiya gaya tha, main bhartiya swatantraaa andolan ke samaajawaadee upadeshon kaa samavesh kiya gaya tha or vah irish samvidhan main vidyaman aise hi siddhanton se prerit tha

 samvidhan ke bhaag III main sannihit mul adhikaar, sabhi bharatiyon ke liye naagarik adhikaar sunishchit karte hai or sarkaar ko vyaktigat swatantraaa kaa atikaraman karne se rokane ke saath nagarikon ke adhikaron kii samaaj dwaara atikaraman se raksha karne kaa daayitv bhi rajya par daalate hai
 The Constitution basically provided seven fundamental rights - right to equality, right to freedom, right against exploitation, right to freedom of religion, culture and education, right to property and right to constitutional remedies
 haalanki, sampatti ke adhikaar ko 1978 main 44wein sanshodhan dwaara samvidhan ke tritiy bhaag se hataa diya gaya tha
 The basic rights are aimed at protecting democratic principles based on individual liberty and equality of all members of society

 These rights are enforceable largely against the legislative and executive wings of the federal and state governments but also the local administrative authorities and other agencies and institutions of public nature or governmental nature, according to the broad definition given in Article 12
 haalanki, kuch adhikaar - jaise ki anuchhed 15, 17, 18, 23, 24 main - nijee vyaktiyon ke viruddh bhi uplabdh hai
 In addition, certain fundamental rights - including those available in Articles 14, 20, 21, 25 - apply to a person of any nationality on Indian land, while others - such as those of Articles 15, 16, 19, 30 Available under - Only applicable to Indian citizens

 Parliament can also restrict the application of the basic rights of members of the Indian Armed Forces and Police Forces by enacting laws under Article 33, ensuring proper discharge of their services and maintenance of discipline
 samanta kaa adhikaar samvidhan kii pramukh guarantiyon main se ek he
 It is embodied in Articles 14–18 which collectively encompass the general principles of equality and non-discrimination before the law, and Articles 17–18 which collectively carry forward the philosophy of social equality
 anuchhed 14 kanoon ke samaksh samanta kii guarantee detaa he, iske saath hi bharat kii simaaon ke andar sabhi vyaktiyon ko kanoon kaa samaan sangrakshan pradaan karata he

 Article 15 prohibits discrimination only on the basis of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, or any of them
 anshatah yaa purnatah rajya ke kosh se sanchalit saarvajanik manoranjan sthalon yaa saarvajanik resort main nishulk pravesh ke sambandh main yah adhikaar rajya ke saath-saath nijee vyaktiyon ke khilaaf bhi pravartaneey he
 However, the state has not been prevented from making special provisions for citizens of socially and educationally backward classes including women and children or scheduled castes and scheduled tribes
 is apwaad kaa praavdhaan isliye kiya gaya he kyonki isamen varnit virgo ke log vanchit maane jate hai or unako vishesh sangrakshan kii aavasyaktaa he
 Article 16 guarantees equality of opportunity in relation to public employment and prohibits the state from discriminating against anyone on the basis of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth or any of them
 kisi bhi pichde varg ke nagarikon kaa saarvajanik sevaaon main paryaapt pratinidhitiv sunushchit karne ke liye unke labharth sakaaratmak karrwai ke upayon ke karyanvayan hetu apwaad banaae jate hai, saath hi kisi dharmik santhaan ke ek pad ko us dharm kaa anusaran karne vaale vyakti ke liye arakshit kiya jaataa he
 The practice of untouchability has been declared a punishable offense under Article 17, the Civil Rights Protection Act 1955 enacted by Parliament, furthering this objective
 anuchhed 18 rajya ko sainya yaa shaikshanik vishistataa ko chhodkar kisi ko bhi koi padavi dene se roktaa he tathaa koi bhi bhartiya naagarik kisi videshi rajya se koi padavi sweekaar nahin kar saktaa
 Thus, Indian aristocratic titles and aristocratic titles conferred by the British have been abolished
 haalanki, bharat ratna puraskaron jaise, bharataratna ko sarvocch nyaayalay dwaara is aadhaar par maanya ghoshit kiya gaya he ki ye puraskaar maatr alankaran hai or praptakarta dwaara padavi ke rup main istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The right to freedom has been included in Articles 19–22 with a view to guaranteeing individual rights considered important by the framers of the Constitution and these Articles also include certain restrictions that can be enforced on individual freedom by the state under special circumstances is
 anuchhed 19 naagarik adhikaron ke rup main chah prakaar kii swatantraaaon kii guarantee detaa he jo keval bhartiya nagarikon ko hi uplabdh hai
 These include freedom of speech and expression, freedom to gather and gather peacefully without arms, freedom of movement anywhere in the territory of India, freedom to settle and reside in any part of India and to adopt any profession Independence of
 ye sabhi swatantraaaen anuchhed 19 main hi varnit kuch uchit pratibandhon ke adheen hoti hai, dinhen rajya dwaara un par lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 The grounds for imposing sanctions vary depending on which freedoms are proposed to be restricted, including national security, public order, decency and morality, contempt of court, inciting crimes and defamation
 aam janata ke hit main kisi vyapaar, udyog yaa seva kaa nagarikon ke apvarjan ke liye rashtriyakaran karne ke liye rajya ko bhi shashakt kiya gaya he
 The freedoms guaranteed by Article 19 are further protected by Articles 20–22
 in anuchhedon ke vistaar, vishesh rup se nirdhaarit prakriya ke siddhant ke sambandh main, par samvidhan sabha main baari bahes hui thi
 In particular, Benegal Narasimha Rao argued that the implementation of such a provision would hamper social laws and cause procedural difficulties in maintaining order, so it should be kept completely out of the Constitution
 samvidhan sabha ne 1948 main antat "nirdhaarit prakriya" shabdon ko hataa diya or unke sthaan par “kanoon dwaara sthapit prakriya” ko shaamil kar liya
 As a result, Article 21, it is taken from Japan
 jo vidhi dwaara sthapit prakriya ke anusaar hone vaali kaarywahi ko chhod kar, jivan yaa vyaktigat samvatantraaa main rajya ke atikaraman se bachaata he, ke arth ko 1978 tak kaaryakari kaarywahi tak simit samajha gaya tha
 However, in 1978, in the case of Maneka Gandhi v
 Union of India, the Supreme Court extended the protection of Article 21 to legislative proceedings, ruling that the law prescribing a process should be fair, impartial and rational, and the procedure laid down in Article 21 Read effectively
 isi maamle main supreme court ne yah bhi kaha ki anuchhed 21 ke antargat "jivan" kaa arth maatr ek "jeev ke astitv" se kahin adhik he; isamen maanviya garima ke saath jeene kaa adhikaar tathaa ve sab pahalu jo jivan ko "arthpurna, purna tathaa jeene yogya" banaate hai, shaamil hai
 Subsequent judicial interpretations have expanded its scope to include a range of rights within Article 21, including livelihoods, clean environment, good health, speedy trial in courts and human rights in captivity
 praathmik str par shiksha ke adhikaar ko 2002 ke 86wein sanvaidhanik sanshodhan dwaara anuchhed 21e main mul adhikaar banaaya gaya he
 Article 20 provides protection in relation to convictions for offenses, including retrospective law and right against double penalties and freedom from self-incrimination
 anuchhed 22 giraftaar hue or hiraasat main liye gaye logon ko vishesh adhikaar pradaan karata he, vishesh rup se giraftaar ke aadhaar suchit kiye jane, apni pasand ke ek vakil se salaah karne, giraftaar ke 24 ghante ke andar ek magistrate ke samaksh pesh kiye jane or magistrate ke aadesh ke bina us avadhi se adhik hiraasat main na rakhe jane kaa adhikaar
 The constitution also authorizes the state to enact laws for preventive detention, subject to the protective measures available in Article 22
 nivarak nirodh se sambandhit praavdhaanon par sanshaywad tathaa ashankaon ke saath charchaa karne ke baad samvidhan sabha ne kuch sanshodhano ke saath 1949 main anichhaa ke saath anumodan kiya tha
 Article 22 provides that when a person has been detained under any law of preventive detention, the state can arrest such person without trial for only three months, without any detention for a longer period
 Is required to be authorized by an advisory board
 hiraasat main liye gaye vyakti ko bhi adhikaar he ki use hiraasat ke aadhaar ke bare main suchit kiya jayega or iske viruddh jitna jaldi avasar mili abhyavedan karne kii anumati di jaaegi
 The rights against exploitation are enshrined in Articles 23-24, in which certain provisions have been made to prevent exploitation of weaker sections of the society by the state or individuals
 anuchhed 23 ke praavdhaan ke anusaar maanav taskari ko pratibandhit he, ise kanoon dwaara dandaneey aparaadh banaaya gaya he, saath hi begaar yaa kisi vyakti ko paarishramik die bina use kaam karne ke liye majaboor karnaa jahaan kanuunan kaam na karne ke liye yaa paarishramik praapt karne ke liye hakdaar he, bhi pratibandhit kiya gaya he
 However, it allows the state to implement compulsory service for public purpose, including compulsory recruitment in the army and community service
 bandhua shram vyavastha adhinium, 1976, ko is anuchhed main prabhavi karne ke liye sansad dwaara adhiniyamit kiya gaya he

 Often, instruction to be fetched is obtained from relatively slow memory while waiting for instruction to be returned, causing the CPU to stall
 yah samasya kaaphi had tak cash or pipeline architekchar dwaara aadhunik procesar main sambodhit kiya he
 The instruction that the CPU fetches from memory determines what the CPU must do
 vyakhya karnaa kadam, shiksha dicoder ke rup main janaa vidyut-paripath tantradwara kiya jaataa he, shiksha kaa sanket he ki sipiu ke anya bhaagon par niyantran main badal jaati he
 The way in which education is interpreted is defined by the CPU instruction set architecture
 aksar, bits anudesh ke bheetar ke ek samooh, seshancode kaha jaataa he, jo ingit karata he oparation, pradarshan kiya ja rahaa he, jabaki shesh kshetron aamtaur par is tarah oparend ke rup main sanchaalan ke liye aavashyak poorak jaankaree pradaan karte hai
 Those operands can be specified as a constant value, or can be a processor register or memory address of a value, as determined by the location of some addressing mode
 kuch CPU main dizin anudesh dicoder ek yantrastha, aparivartaneey circuit ke rup main karyanvit kiya jaataa he
 In others, a micro-programmable CPU configuration is used to translate instructions given in sets of signals that are applied sequentially over several clock pulses
 kuch maamalon main smriti he ki micro program dukaanon yah tarika he jisamen sipiu nirdesh dicode badalane ke liye sambhav banane ririteble he
 After the fetch and decode step, the executing step is performed
 sipiu vaastukala ke aadhaar par, yah ek ekal karrwai yaa karrwai ke ek drishy se milakar kar sakate
 During each task, different parts of the CPU are electrically connected, so they can all or usually be performed in response to a clock pulse, part of the desired operation and then the operation is completed
 bahut baar parinaam baad ke nirdesh ke dwaara twarit pahunch ke liye ek aantarik sipiu register karne ke liye likhaa jaataa he
 In other cases the result is slower, but less expensive and can be written for high capacity main memory
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi ek atirikt anudesh kriyanvit kiya ja rahaa he, ankaganitiya tark ikai aadaanon sankaarya sutron kii ek jodi se jude hai, ALU ek atirikt karrwai karne ke liye configar kiya gaya he, isliye he ki yoga ke apane sankaarya aadaanon apane utpaadan main dikhaai degaa, or ALU utpaadan he ki raashi praapt hoga bhandaaran se judaa he
 When the clock pulse occurs, the sum will be transferred to storage and, if the resulting sum is too large, an arithmetic overflow flag will be installed
 ek sipiu ke vidyut-paripath tantra main yantrastha buniyadi kaaryon pradarshan kar sakate hai kaa ek set he, ek anudesh set bulaayaa
 Such operations may include, for example, adding or subtracting two numbers to compare two numbers, or jumping to a different part of a program
 prayek buniyadi aaparishan bits, mashin bhashaa seshancode ke rup main janaa ek vishesh sangyojan kaa pratinidhitiv karti he ; ek mashin bhashaa kaarykram main die gaye nirdeshon ko kriyanvit karte hue, sipiu jo aaparishan dwaara ' decoding " seshancode pradarshan karne kaa faisla kiya
 a complete machine language instruction consists of an opcode and in many cases, additional bits that specify the logic for the operation
 jatilta paimaane upar ja rahe hai, ek mashin bhashaa program he ki sipiu karyanvit mashin bhashaa nirdeshon kaa ek sangrah he
 The actual mathematical operation for each instruction is performed by a combinational logic circuit within the CPU processor known as the arithmetic logic unit or ALU
 saamaanya taur par, ek sipiu smriti se yah dilkash, iske ALU kaa upyog kar ek karrwai karne ke liye, or phir smriti ke liye parinaam bhandaaran ke dwaara ek nirdesh karyanvit
 Various other machine instructions exist, such as those on memory and floating it back to the floating point number used by the CPU floating point unit, branching operations, and those for data loads from mathematical operations, such as integer arithmetic and logic operations
 Instructions for sipiu ke niyantran ikai vidyut-paripath tantra vidyut sanketon kaa upyog karata he ki puure computer pranali ko nirdeshit karne ke liye sangrahit kaarykram nirdesh baahar le jane ke liye hota he
 The control unit does not execute program instructions; Actually, it directs other parts of the system to do so
 niyantran ikai donon ALU or smriti ke saath sanchaar
 The arithmetic logic unit is a digital circuit within the processor that performs integer arithmetic and logic bitwise operations
 ALU ko jaankaree data shabdon par sanchalit karne ke liye, pichley parichaalan se sthiti kii jaankaree, or yah darshata he jo karrwai karne ke liye niyantran ikai se ek kuta rahe hai
 Depending on the instruction being executed, the operand may come from the internal CPU register or external memory, or they may be constants generated by the ALU itself
 jab sabhi input sanketon based or ALU vidyut-paripath tantra ke madhyam se prachaarit kiya he, pradarshan ke aaparishan ke parinaam ALU ke utpaadan par prakat hota he
 The result is both a data word, which can be stored in a register or memory, and status information that is typically stored in a special, internal CPU register reserved for this purpose
 sabase ucch ant microprocessron ek smriti prabandhan ikai he, bhautik RAM paton main taarkik paton ke anuwaad smriti sangrakshan or pejing kshamtaaon, abhaasi smriti ke liye upyogi pradaan karte hai
 Simple processors, especially microcontrollers usually do not include an MMU
 har sipiu ek vishisht tareeke se sankhyatmak mulyon kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 For example, some early digital computers represented familiar decimal digit system values as numbers, and others employed more unusual representations, such as ternary
 lagbhag sabhi aadhunik cpus is tarah ke ek "ucch" yaa "kam" voltage ke rup main dwiadhari ke rup main sankhya, prayek ank ke saath kuch do mahatvapurn bhautik maatra dwaara pratinidhitiv kiya ja rahaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Relative to the numerical representation is the size and integer number that a CPU can represent that is accurate
 ek binary sipiu ke maamle main, is bits ki sipiu ek oparation, jo aamtaur par "shabd kaa aakaar", " thodaa chaudaai ", "data kaha jaataa he main prakriya kar sakate hai kii sankhya se mapa jaataa he, path chaudaai "," purnank parishuddhta ", yaa" purnank aakaar "
 The integer size of a CPU determines the limit values of the integer it can operate on directly
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek 8 bit sipiu sidhe aath bits, jo 256 asatat purnank mulyon kii ek shrinkhalaa he dwaara pratinidhitiv purnankon herpher kar sakate hai
 The integer range can also affect the number of memory locations the CPU can directly address
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek dwiadhari sipiu 32 bit kaa upyog karata he, to ek smriti pate kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye to yah sidhe 2^32 smriti sthanon ko sambodhit kar sakate hai
 To circumvent this limitation and for various other reasons, some CPU usage mechanisms have to be addressed that allow additional memory
 bada shabd aakaar ke saath sipiu adhik vidyut-paripath tantra kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or iske parinamswaroop, shaareerik rup se bade hote hai adhik laagat, or adhik bijli kii khapat 
 As a result, smaller 4 or 8 bit microcontrollers are commonly used in modern applications, even though cpus with much larger word sizes are available
 jab ucch pradarshan kii aavashyaktaa he, haalanki, ek bada shabd aakaar ke laabhon ko nuksaan pallaa jhukna saktaa he
 a CPU may have lower data sizes than internal data paths and to reduce costs
 udhaaharan ke liye, bhale hi IBM pranali / 360 anudesh set ek 32-bit anudesh set, system / 360 model 30 or model 40 ganit taarkik ikai main 8 bit data raaston tha, isliye he ki ek 32- bit jodne ke liye aavashyak chaar tha chakra, oparend se prayek 8 bit ke liye ek, or, bhale hi motorola 68k anudesh set ek 32-bit anudesh set, motorola 68000 or motorola tha 68010, ganit taarkik ikai main 16-bit data raaston tha to ek 32 ki bit do chakron aavashyak joden
 To achieve some of the advantages afforded by both low and high bit lengths, multiple instruction sets are integer and different bit widths for floating point data, implementing CPU sets to different bit widths for different parts of the learning device
 Is allowed
 udhaaharan ke liye, IBM pranali / 360 anudesh set mukhya rup se 32 sa ho gaya tha, lekin adhik se adhik sateekta or chal bindu sankhya main seemaa kii suvidha ke liye 64-bit chal bindu mulyon kaa samarthan kiya
 The System / 360 model had 65 decimal and an 8-bit adder for fixed-point binary arithmetic and a 60-bit adder for floating-point arithmetic

 Most cpus are synchronous circuits, which means they employ a clock signal, their sequential operating speed
 ghadi sanket ek bahari thartharaanvaala circuit he ki daalon ek aavadhik varg tarang ke rup main ek duusare ke anuroop ek sankhya utpann dwaara nirmit he
 The frequency of clock pulses determines the rate at which a CPU executes instructions and consequently, the faster the clock, the more instructions the CPU will execute
 sipiu ke samuchit sanchaalan ko sunishchit karne ke liye, ghadi kii avadhi ke madhyam se sipiu prachaar karne ke liye sabhi sanketon ke liye aavashyak adhik se adhik samay se adhik he
 In setting the clock period to a value well above the worst case propagation delay, it is entirely possible to design the CPU and its surrounds and the "edges" of the falling clock signal to move the data
 yah donon ek dizin pariprekshya or ek ghatak ginati ke nazariye se, sipiu kaaphi saral banane kaa laabh diya he
 However, it also has the disadvantage that the entire CPU carries on its own slower elements, even though some parts of it are very fast
 yah seemaa kaaphi had tak bad sipiu samanta ke vibhinn tareekon ke liye muaavja diya gaya he However, Vastu improvements alone are not the solution to all of the shortcomings of synchronous cpus globally
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek ghadi sanket kisi anya bijli ke sanket kii deree ke adheen he
 High clock rates in increasingly complex cpus make it more difficult to keep clock signals in phase throughout the entire unit
 yah kai aadhunik cpus kai samaan ghadi kaa sanket he ki aavashyaktaa ke liye prerit kiya ek bhi sanket kaaphi kharabi ke sipiu paidaa karne ke liye paryaapt deree se bachane ke liye pradaan kiya ja sake
 Another major issue is, as clock rates increase dramatically, the amount of heat that is dissipated by the CPU
 lagaataar badalte ghadi he ki kya ve us samay istemaal kiya ja rahaa he ki parvaah kiye bina switch karne ke liye kai ghatakon kaa kaaran banataa he
 In general, a component that is switching uses more energy than an element in a steady state
 isliye, ghadi kii dar bad jaati he, taaki urja kii khapat karata he, sipiu thanda samaadhaan ke rup main adhik garmi lanpatata kii aavashyaktaa ke liye sipiu ke kaaran
 One method of working with switching of redundant components is called clock set, which involves turning off the clock signal for redundant components
 haalanki, is baar lagu karnaa mushkil mana jaataa he or isliye bahut kam bijli dizin ke baahar aam upyog main nahin dekha he he
 a notable recent CPU design uses the extensive clock block that the IBM Powered pc-based Xenon Xbox 360 is used for; In this way, the power requirements of the Xbox 360 are greatly reduced
 ek vaishvik ghadi sanket ke saath samasyaon main se kuch ko sambodhit karne kaa ek or tarika he ghadi sanket ko hataane kii puri tarah he
 While global clock signal removal makes the design process significantly more complex in many ways, asynchronous designs carry marked advantages in power consumption and heat dissipation compared with similar synchronous designs
 jabaki kuch asaamaanya, puure atulykaalik sipiu ek vaishvik ghadi sanket ke upyog ke bina banaaya gaya he
 Two notable examples of this are the complaint amulets from ARM and mips3000 compatible mini mips
 balki puri tarah se ghadi sanket ko hataane kii tulana main, kuch sipiu dizin divaais ke kuch bhaagon atulykaalik ho saktaa he, is tarah ke super adish pipelining ke saath sangyojan ke rup main atulykaalik alus kaa upyog kar kuch ganit pradarshan laabh praapt karne ke liye ke rup main anumati dete hai
 While it is not entirely clear whether fully asynchronous designs can perform at a comparable or better level than their synchronous counterparts, it is clear that they at least excel in simple mathematics operations
 yah unke utkrisht bijli kii khapat or garmi lanpatata gunon ke saath sanyukt, unhen ambeded computer ke liye bahut upyukt banaata he
 a CPU description of the basic operation offered in the previous section describes the simplest form that a CPU can take
 sipiu ke is prakaar, aamtaur par ke rup main up adish ke liye bheja, par chal rahi he or ek samay main data ke ek yaa do tukade par ek nirdesh karyanvit, ki ghadi chakra ke anusaar kam se kam ek nirdesh he 
 This process gives rise to an inherent inefficiency in the suboptimal CPU
 ke baad se hi ek nirdesh ek samay main maar daalaa he, puure sipiu agle nirdesh ke liye aage badhane se pehle puraa karne ke liye he ki shiksha ke liye intazaar karnaa hoga
 Consequently, subdirectory CPU instructions that "hang" when it takes more than one clock cycle to complete execution
 yahaan tak ki ek duusare nishpaadan ikai jodne ke pradarshan main zyada sudhaar nahin karata he ; ke bajaay ek maarg lataka diya ja rahaa he, ab do raste rakh diya jaataa he or aprayukt transistor kii sankhya main vruddhi hui he
 This design, in which the cpu's execution resources can operate on only one instruction at a time, can only possibly reach scalar performance
 haalanki, pradarshan lagbhag hameshaa uchhadish he 
 Attempts to achieve scalar and better performance have resulted in a variety of design methods that cause cpus to behave less linearly and to do more in parallel
 jab sipiu main samanta kii charchaa karte hue, do shabdon aam taur par in dizin takneekon vargeekrut karne ke liye istemaal kar rahe hai: Each method differs in both the way in which they are implemented, as well as the relative effectiveness they spend in increasing CPU performance for an application

 Many reported IPS values represent "peak" execution rates on artificial instruction sequences with some branches, while realistic workloads consist of a mixture of instructions and applications, some of which take longer to execute than others
 It is made
 smriti padanukram kaa pradarshan bhi bahut procesar pradarshan, mushkil se maips gananaa main mana jaataa he ek mudda prabhavit karata he
 Because of these problems, various standardized tests, often called "benchmarks" for this specific purpose, have been developed to try to measure actual effective performance in commonly used applications
 computer ke prasanskaran ke pradarshan multi kor procesar he, jo anivaary rup se ek ekikrut circuit main do yaa do se adhik vyakti procesar plag he kaa upyog kar kii vruddhi hui he
 Ideally, a dual core processor would be nearly twice as powerful as a single core processor
 abhyaas main, pradarshan laabh ab tak chote, apurna software elgoridam or karyanvayan kii vajah se he ke bare main keval 50%
 Increasing the number of cores in a processor increases the workload that can be controlled

 Different floors can be thought of as a processing plant, with each core assuming a different function
 kabhi kabhi, in kor unhen asann kor ke rup main ek hi kaary sambhaal lenge agar ek single kor jaankaree ko sanbhaalane ke liye paryaapt nahin he
 Modern cpus, such as hyper-threading and those cores, which gradually involve the sharing of actual CPU resources, aim for increased usage, and a more complex gradual performance level due to the special capabilities of monitoring hardware usage

 In other words, it can be said that how well the energy is being transferred to the device is measured by its efficiency
 saamanytah kisi bhi nikaay ke sandarbh main, upyogi output urja or input urja ke anupaat ko urja dakshata kehete hai
 When it comes to thermal energy, the thermal energy given to a device or the total energy consumed by that device is q in { \ displaystyle Q_ {in}} while its desired output, the mechanical work done by that device, is w out { \ displaystyle W_ {out}}, or q out { \ displaystyle Q_ {out}}, or both

 atah Normally, the ratio of energy consumption in a device to the force produced by it can be understood in such a way that if the fuel burns in an inertial engine, it not only generates electricity by running the generator but also in the process Fuel is ignited to run the engine, due to which the heat produced with the engine is also produced as a product, the higher the heat
 Will it reduce the capacity to make electricity

 Here is a list of language-regulatory institutions that regulate standard languages
 inhen praayah 'bhashaa academy' kaha jaataa he
 Language academies work for the purpose of linguistic correctness and formulate and publish policies related to language
 The auxiliary language Interlingua has no regulating body, as its vocabulary, grammar, and orthography are viewed as a product of ongoing social forces
 In theory, Interlingua therefore evolves independent from any human regulator
 Interlingua's vocabulary is verified and recorded by dynamically applying certain general principles to an existing set of natural languages and their etymologies
 Languages such as Esperanto and Ido have been constructed by a person or small group, before being adopted and developed by communities of users
 Bodies such as the Akademio de Esperanto look at questions of usage in the light of the original goals and principles of the language
 Whereas a number of the puristically motivated language societies have assumed de facto responsibility for language cultivation, the decisions of the academies have often had the force of law
 


 Since academies are so closely associated with the notion of purism, a brief word on their history may not be out of place
 The first academy to deal expressly and exclusively with language matters was the Accademia della Crusca, 


 Its orientation was essentially conservative, favouring a return to the Tuscan language as cultivated in the fourteenth century over the innovations of contemporary renaissance poets like Torquato Tasso
 


 One of its first tasks – as with so many academies to follow – was to produce a large-scale prescriptive dictionary of Italian Kisan Kanya was India's first indigenously produced color film intercity express 9303 bhartiya rail dwaara sanchalit ek mail express train he
