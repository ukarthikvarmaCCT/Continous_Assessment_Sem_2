 Highly criticizing the pseudo-scientific claims about the Quran, astronomer Nidhal Gossoum has encouraged about the Quran that the Quran provides by developing a "concept of knowledge"
 vah likhte hai: "quran saboot ke bina anumaan lagane ke khatre par dhyaan khinchataa he gyaan nahin kiya he 


 17:36) or kai alag-alag chhandon main musalamaanon se poochta he pramaanon kii aavashyaktaa ke liye, to saboot kii aavashyaktaa he, donon dharmik vishwaas or prakritik vigyaan main

 The philosopher Mohammad Iqbal considered the methodology and epistemology of the Quran as empirical and rational
 yah aam taur par sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki lagbhag 750 chand hai quran main prakritik ghatana se nipatane main
 The study of nature is "encouraged and highly recommended" in many of these verses, and historical Islamic scientists such as al-biruni and al-battani drew their inspiration from Quranic verses
 mohammad hashim kamali ne kaha he ki "vaigyanik avlokan, prayogtmak gyaan or tarksangatta" praathmik saadhan hai jinke saath maanavtaa quran main iske liye nirdhaarit lakshyon ko praapt kar sakati he
 Ziauddin Sardar made a case for Muslims to develop the foundations of modern science in order to pay attention and reflect on the natural phenomena that the Quran repeatedly calls for
 bhautik vigyaani abdus salaam ne apane nobel puraskaar bhoj pate main quran kii ek prasiddh kavita uddhrut kii or phir kaha: "yah prabhaav sabhi bhautikavidon kaa vishwaas he: jitna gaharaa ham chaahate hai, utana hi adhik hamaare aashcharya utsahit, hamaare nazar kaa chamak he "
 One of Salam's core beliefs was that there is no contradiction between Islam and discoveries that science tells humanity about nature and the universe
 salaam ne yah bhi raay rakhi ki quran or adhyayan or tarksangat pratibimb kii islamic bhaavana asaadhaaran sabhyataa ke vikaas kaa strot thi
 Salaam, in particular, used Ibn al-haytham and al-biruni as pioneers of the empiricist who introduced the experimental approach, breaking with Aristotle's influence and thus giving rise to modern science

 The message of the Quran is conveyed with various literary structures and devices
 mul arabi main, surya or chand dhvanyatmak or vishaygat sanrachanaon ko niojit karte hai jo paath ke sandesh ko yaad karne ke liye darshakon ke prayaason main sahaayta karte hai
 Muslims insist that the content and style of the Quran are inappropriate
 quran kii bhashaa ko "kavita gadhy" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he kyonki yah kavita or gadhy donon kaa hissaa he; haalanki, yah vivaran kuranik bhashaa kii layaaddh gunvattta ko vyakt karne main vifal hone kaa jokhim chalaata he, jo kuch hisson main adhik kavy he or dusron main adhik gadhy jaisaa he
 The Quran, while found throughout the Quran, is typical of many earlier Mecca Suras, in which relatively few verses throw singing words into prominence
 is tarah ke rup kii prabhaavashiltaa udhaaharan ke liye sura 81 main spasht he, or isamen koi andeh nahin he ki in margon ne shrotaaon ke vivek ko prabhavit kiya
 a change of verse from one set of verses to another signal is often a change in the subject of discussion
 baad ke khand bhi is form ko sangrakshit karte hai lekin style adhik expogitary he
 The Quranic text has no beginning, middle or end, its nonlinear structure is similar to a web or net

 Selling also addresses the recurrence of much discussion of the Quran, also seeing it as a literary device
 ek paath aatm-sanderbhit hota he jab yah swayan ke bare main bolta he or khud ko sanderbhit karata he
 According to Stephen Wilde, the Quran illustrates this metatextuality by explaining, classifying, interpreting and justifying the words to be transmitted
 un anuchhedon main aatm- refrencielity spasht he jahaan quran swayan ko ek aatmanirbhar tareeke se, samachar, maandand ke rup main swayan ko prakat karne ke rup main sanderbhit karata he
 There is a blessed remembrance that we sent down, so are you rejecting it now? "), Or in the frequent presence of the" say "tag, when Muhammad is ordered to speak

 This feature is more pronounced in early Mecca Suras
 mukhya lekh: tafasir The Quran has sparked a vast body of commentary and interpretation intended to explain the meanings of Quranic verses, clarify their import, and unravel their significance
 tafaseer musalamaanon kii sabase shuruaati shaikshanik gatividhiyon main se ek he
 According to the Quran, Muhammad was the first person to describe the meanings of verses for early Muslims
 anya shuruaati nikaayon main mohammad ke kuch saathi shaamil the, jaise ' ali ebn abi talib ,' abdulla ebn abbaas, abdulla ebn umr or ubey ebn kaab 
 In those days exegesis was limited to the literary aspects of the poem, the background of its publication and, sometimes, the explanation of the interpretation of one poem with the help of another
 yadi kavita ek aitihaasik ghatana ke bare main thi, to kabhi-kabhi mohammad kii kuch paramparaon ko iskaa arth spasht karne ke liye varnit kiya gaya tha
 Since the Quran is spoken in classical Arabic, many of the latter did not convert to Islam, they did not always understand Quranic Arabic, they did not catch Muslims who were fluent in Arabic of Muslims and were concerned with settling subjects in the Quran
 Clear struggle of

 However, other scholars say that there is no repeal in the Quran
 ahmadiya muslim samudaay ne quran par das khand vaali urdu tippanee prakashit kii he, jiskaa naam tafaseer i kabir he 
 The esoteric interpretation or Sufi interpretation attempts to unveil the inner meaning of the Quran
 sufiwaad chhandon ke spasht bindu se aage badhata he or iske bajaay quran ke chand ko aantarik yaa gudh or chetana or astitv ke aadhyatmik ayaamon se sambandhit karata he
 According to Sands, esoteric interpretations are more suggestive than declarative, they are indicative rather than explanatory
 ve sambhaavnaaon ko ingit karte hai jitna ki ve prayek lekhak kii antardrushti kaa pradarshan karte hai
 The Sufi interpretation, according to Annabel Keller, is also an example of the use of the subject of love, for example in the Qur'anic interpretation of the Quran
 quran 7: 143 kahata he: When Moses came at the time when we appointed, and his Allah spoke to him, he said, 'my Allah, show me yourself! let me see you!' He said, 'you won't see me, but look at that mountain, if it stays strong you will see me
 ' jab uske bhagwaan ne pahaad par khud ko prakat kiya, to usne ise kharaab kar diya
 Moses fainted
 jab vah thik ho gaya, usne kaha, 'jai ho! main tumse pashchaatap karata hoon! main vishwaas karne vaala pehla vyakti hum! In 7: 143 Moses, the way of those who are in love, comes asking for a vision but his will is denied, he is commanded to see other than the mountain, while the mountain is able to see God
 
 parvat par bhagwaan ke prakat hone kii drushti se parvat chur or musa behosh hojaate hai
 In the words of Kushayari, Moses came like thousands of men who traveled great distances, and Moses of Moses had nothing left
 khud se unmoolan kii sthiti main, musa ko vaastaviktaaon kaa anaavaran diya gaya tha
 From a Sufi point of view, God always causes the will and suffering of the beloved and the wayfarer to realize the truth
 mohammad hossain taababatei kehete hai ki baad ke utthanon ke bich lokapriy spashtikaran ke anusaar, tavil kaa arth he ki ek kavita kaa nirdesh diya gaya he
 The meaning of revelation, as opposed to Tawal, is clear according to the explicit meaning of the words, as they were told
 lekin yah spashtikaran itnaa vyapak ho gaya he ki, vartmaan main, yah tavil kaa praathmik arth ban gaya he, jiskaa mul rup se "vaapasi karne" yaa "vaapasi sthaan" kaa arth tha
 In Tabatai's view, what is called taiwil or hermeneutic interpretation of the Quran is not concerned with the signification of words
 iske bajaay, yah kuch sachai or vaastaviktaaon se sambandhit he jo purushon ke saamaanya bhaag kii samaj se pare he; phir bhi yah in satyon or vaastaviktaaon se he ki siddhant ke siddhant or quran ke vyaavhaarik nishedh jari hai
 Interpretation is not the meaning of the poem but it is transparent in a particular type of transit through that meaning
 ek aadhyatmik vaastaviktaa he- jo ek kanoon kaa paalan karne kaa mukhya uddeshy he, yaa divine gun kaa varnan karne kaa mul uddeshy he- or phir ek vaastavik mahatv he ki ek quran kii kahani kaa sandarbh he
 According to Shia beliefs, which are strongly rooted in knowledge such as Muhammad and Imams, know the mysteries of the Quran
 tabatai ke anusaar, bayaan "koi bhi bhagwaan ko chhodkar isaki vyakhya ko jaanata he" kisi bhi virdohi yaa yogyata khand ke bina maanya rahata he
 Therefore, as far as this verse is concerned, knowledge of Quranic interpretation is reserved for God
 lekin Tabatabaei anya chhandon kaa upyog karata he or nishkarsh nikaala he ki jo log bhagwaan dwaara shuddh hai quran kii vyakhya kuch had tak pataa he
 According to Tabatai, there are esoteric interpretations that are acceptable and unacceptable
 sweekaarya ta'vil apane shabdic arth se pare ek kavita ke arth ko sanderbhit karata he; balki antarnihit arth, jo antat keval bhagwaan ke liye janaa jaataa he or akele maanav vichaaron ke madhyam se sidhe samajha nahin ja saktaa he
 The verses in question here refer to the human qualities of coming, going, sitting, contentment, anger, and sorrow, which are clearly attributed to God
 asweekaarya ta'wil vah he jahaan ek saboot ke madhyam se ek alag arth ke liye ek kavita kaa spasht arth "sthanantarit" hota he; yah vidhi spasht visangatiyon ke bina nahin he
 Although this unacceptable Ta'wil has gained considerable acceptance, it is incorrect and cannot be applied to Quranic verses
 sahi vyakhya yah he ki vaastaviktaa ek kavita ko sanderbhit karti he
 It is found in all verses, decisive and ambiguous alike; This is not the meaning of the word; It is a fact that it is too fantastic for words
 bhagwaan ne unhen apane dimag main thodaa sa laane ke liye shabdon ke saath taiyaar kiya he; is sambandh main ve kahaniyon kii tarah hai jinka upyog dimag main ek tasviir banane ke liye kiya jaataa he, or is prakaar shrota ko spasht rup se icchit vichaar ko samajhane main madad milti he
 One of the notable authors of esoteric interpretation before the 12th century is Sulami whose work would not have been preserved without most of the early Sufi commentaries
 sulaami kii pramukh tippanee hekik al-tafaseer kii ek pustak he jo pehle sufi kii tippaniyon kaa sankalan he
 Several other works, including commentaries from Kushayari, Dayalam, Shirazi and Suhrawardy, emerged from the 11th century
 in kaaryon main sulaami kii kitabon or lekhak ke yogadan se saamagree shaamil he
 Many works have been written in Persian such as the works of Mabri Kashf al-asrar
 rumi ne apni pustak mathnavi main vishaal rahasyamay kavita likhi thi
 Rumi makes heavy use of the Quran in his poetry, a feature that is sometimes omitted in the translation of Rumi's work
 mathnavi main badi sankhya main kuranik maarg paae ja sakate hai, jinamein se kuch quran kii ek sufi vyakhya par vichaar karte hai
 Rumi's book is not exceptional for quotations and elaborations on the Quran, however, Rumi mentions the Quran more often
 simnani ne quran par gudh exegesis ke do prabhaavshaalee kaaryon ko likhaa tha
 He reconciled the sentiments of Sunni Islam with the ideas and manifestations of God in the material world
 18 veen shatabdi main ismail haaki bursavi ke kaam jaise vyapak sufi tippaniyan dikhaai detii hai

 arabi main likhaa gaya he, yah lekhak ke apane vichaaron ko unke purvavartiyon ke saath jodta he
 Unlike the Salafis and Zahiri, the Shia and Sufis as well as some other Muslim philosophers believe that the meaning of the Quran is not limited to the literal aspect
 unke liye, yah ek aavashyak vichaar he ki quran main bhi aantarik pahalu hai
 Henry Corbin describes a hadith that goes back to Muhammad: quran main bahari upasthiti or ek chhipi gaharaai, ek asaadhaaran arth or ek gudh arth he
 This esoteric meaning in turn hides an esoteric meaning
 to yah saat gudh arthon ke liye chalaa jaataa he
 According to this view, it has also become clear that the internal meaning of the Quran does not eliminate or invalidate its external meaning
 iske bajaay, yah aatma kii tarah he, jo sharir ko jivan detaa he
 Corbin considers the Quran to play a role in Islamic philosophy, as nanology itself goes hand in hand with the prophet
 paath ke zahir se nipatane vaali tippaniyon ko tafaseer kaha jaataa he, or batin se nipatane vaali harmenetic or gudh tippaniyon ko tavil, jisamen paath ko isaki shuruyaat main waapas lenaa shaamil he
 Commentators with an esoteric slant believe that the ultimate meaning of the Quran is known only to God
 iske vipareet, kuranik shabdikta, iske baad salaphis or jahiris, yah vishwaas he ki quran ko keval iske spasht arth main hi liya janaa chahie
 The reenactment is the name of the hermeneutic style of some former Muslims who converted to Christianity
 unki style yaa punrariti vigyaapan or gaiyr-vyavasthit he or maafee maangane kii disha main taiyaar he
 This tradition of interpretation is based on the following practices: grammatical rethinking, curriculum preference, retrieval, and rethinking concession
 mukhya lekh: quran anuwadyah bhi dekhen: quran ke anuwaadon kii suchikuran kaa anuwaad hameshaa samasyagrast or kathin rahaa he
 Many argue that the Quranic text cannot be reproduced in any other language or form
 iske alaava, ek arabi shabd ke sandarbh ke aadhaar par kai arth ho sakate hai, sateek anuwaad ko or bhi kathin banaate hai
 Nevertheless, the Quran has been translated into most African, Asian and European languages

 The Quran has not only created an entirely new linguistic corpus to convey its message, but it also endorses older, pre-islamic words with older meanings and it is those meanings that are in the language and later i take roots in literature


 allaah ne is dharti par manushya ko apana caliph banaakar bheja he
 Before sending, he had properly explained to every person that they are going to earth for a short time, after that they have to return to him
 jahaan use apane un kaaryon kaa acha yaa bura badla milegaa jo usne dharti par kiye
 In the same way, there are many more
 is dharti par manushya ko kaary karne kii swatantraaa he
 The means of the earth are allowed to be used
 achche or bure kaary ko karne par use taktal koi roak yaa inaam nahin he
 But with this freedom, God arranged for the divine commands to be given to the human beings on the earth to live life exactly in that form, and he sent his messengers to every part of the earth, who sent the message of God to humans
 kaha jaataa he ki aise ishdooton kii sankhya 1,84,000 ke qareeb rahi
 Hazrat Muhammad was the final link in this connection
 aap ke baad ab koi doot nahin aayega kintu hazarat isa apane jivan ke shesh varsh is dharti par pun: guzaarenge
 The last book of God is in your hand, no other divine book will come now
 hazaron varshon tak nirantar aane vaale pegambaron kaa chaahe ve dharti ke kisi bhi bhaag main avatarit hue hon, unka sandesh ek tha, unka mishan ek tha, ishwariya aadesh ke anusaar manushyon ko jeena sikhaanaa
 Because of the passage of thousands of years, in the divine orders, human beings would add their thoughts, their convenience and create a new religion and distort the original religion and create a monstrosity and many times work against the divine orders
 kyon ki har prabhavi vyakti apni shakti ke aage sab ko natmastak dekhnaa chahta tha
 After all, the last prophet Hazrat Muhammad came to this earth with the Quran and the Quran came with the challenge of God that God himself would protect it
 1500 varsh kaa lambaa samay yah bataata he ki koran virodhiyon ke saare prayaason ke baad bhi koran ke ek shabd main bhi parivartan sambhav nahin ho sakaa he
 This book will remain in its original form till the Holocaust
 iske saath koran kaa yah chalange bhi apane sthaan par abhi tak qaayam he ki jo ise ishwariya granth nahin maanate hon to ve is jaisi puri kitaab nahin uskaa ek chota bhaag hi bana kar dikhaa den
 Knowing this form of the Qur'an, it should be known that this book was not given to Hazrat Muhammad in the form of reading it to the people and printed and put it in every house
 balki samay samay par 23 varshon tak aavashyaktaa anusaar yah kitaab avatarit hui or aap ne ishwar kii marzi se uske adeshon ke anusaar dharti par vah samaaj banaaya jaisaa ishwar kaa aadesh tha
 According to the western thinker HG Wells, discourses were given a lot on this earth, but on the basis of those discourses a society was first created by Hazrat Muhammad
 yahan yah jaananaa ruchikar hoga ki wales islam premi nahin balki islam virdohi he or uski kitaaben islam virodh main prakashit hui hai
 The scientific facts that are known to us are hidden in the Quran and there are hundreds of places where it seems that human knowledge has not yet reached that reality
 baar baar koran aapako vichaar karne kii daavat detaa he
 Invites to know the secrets of the land and the sky
 ek uljhan or saamne aati he
 According to the Quran's claim that he is for the people of the whole earth and for the rest of the time, but the Arabs of that time appear to be addressed to him
 sarsari taur par yahi lagata he ki koran us samay ke arabon ke liye hi avatarit kiya gaya tha lekin aap jab bhi kisi aise sthaan par pahunchein jab yah lage ki yah baat keval ek khaas kaal tathaa desh ke liye he, tab vahaan ruuk kar vichaar karen yaa ise note karke baad main is par vichaar karen to aap ko har baar lagegaa ki manushya har yug or har bhu bhaag kaa ek he or us par vah baat thik waisi hi lagu hoti he, jaisi us samay ke log|arabon par lagu hoti thi
 Great books have been written and can be written in relation to the Quran for Muslims
 yahaan u¬ddeshy koran kaa ek sankshipt parichay or uske ummat par kya haq hai, yaha spasht karnaa he
 There is a hadith recited from Hazrat Ali
 hazarat haaris faramaate hai ki main masjid main daakhil hua to dekha ki kuch log kuch samasyaon main jhagada kar rahe hai
 i went to Hazrat Ali and informed him
 hazarat ali ne farmaaya- kya yah baaten hone lageen? maine kaha, ji haa
 Hazrat Ali ordered- Remember i have heard from Rasul Allah
 aap ne farmaaya- khabardaar raho nikat hi ek bada fitanaa sar uthayega maine arz kiya- is fitane main nijaat kaa zariyaa kya hoga? farmaaya-allaah kii kitaab
 The entire squeeze of the Quran comes in this one hadith
 koran dharti par allaah kii antim kitaab uski khyaati ke anuroop he
 It is very easy and it is also very difficult
 aasaan yah tab he jab ise yaad karne ke liye padhaa jaae
 If you do not fail in your destiny and want instruction from the Quran, then Allah has made this book easy
 samajhane or yaad karne ke liye yah vishwa kii sabase aasaan kitaab he
 It is in the Qur'an itself 'and we have made it easy to understand the Qur'an, so is there anyone to think and understand?' In the same way, there are many more
 duusari ore doorbini kii drushti se yah vishwa kii kathinatam kitaab he puri puri zindagi khapa dene ke baad bhi isaki gaharaai naapnaa sambhav nahin
 From this point of view, it is a sea
 sadiyaan biit gayi or koran kaa chamatkaar ab bhi qaayam he
 And the centuries will pass, but the miracle of the Quran will never end
 keval hidaayat paane ke liye aasaan tareeqa yah he ki atal aayaton par dhyaan rahe or aayaton par imaan ho ki yah bhi allaah kii ore se hai
 The world is progressing continuously, human knowledge is increasing continuously, which was defunct yesterday in the Quran, today it has become clear, and tomorrow some parts of it will be clear
 isi tarah gnanarjan ke liye bhi do vibhinn tareeqe apnaanaa honge
 In the Qur'an in terms of orders, the contemplator must travel backwards
 koran ke aadesh kaa arth dharm shastriyon, vidwaanon ne kya liya, tabatabain, tabain ) ke saathiyon ko dekha
 ) And what did Sahaba mean by this
 yahaan tak ki khud ko hazarat mohammad ke qadamon tak pahunchaa de ki khud sahabe koran kaa is bare main kya aadesh tha? On the other hand, in terms of knowledge, it has to be considered further and continuously forward
 samay ke saath hi nahin usase aage chalaa jaae
 The surface of human knowledge is constantly increasing
 koran main vigyaan kaa sarvocch str he us par vichaar kar nae avishkaar, khoj or jo vaigyanik tathy hai un par kaary kiya ja saktaa he
 Mouzaza refers to a miracle that is on the hands of a prophet or Rasul and is beyond human power, to which the human intellect is shocked
 In every age, whenever any Rasul reached the divine orders of man, miracles were given to him by Allah
 hazarat musa ko asa di gai, jisase kai chamatkaar dikhaae gayi
 Hazrat Isa was given the opportunity to resurrect the dead, to heal the sick
 kisi bhi nabi kaa asal muajaza vah he jise vah daawey ke saath pesh kare
 Hundreds of Mojaz are described on the hand of Hazrat Muhammad, but the claim which is presented with the claim and which is still present to the world as a miracle, is the Qur'an which this disciple of the world is unanswered
 Be made as shown
 yah daawa koran main kai sthaan par kiya gaya
 In the same way, there are many more
 koran purna rup se surakshit rahegaa, is daawey ko 1500 varsh biit gaye or koran surakshit he, purna surakshit he
 This has been proven, which is a miracle
 The Qur'an has stood the test of science, and its scientific narratives are preceded by scientific efforts
 yah bhi ek chamatkaar he
 1500 years ago in the Arabian desert, an illiterate person presented a book that showed its truth in front of all the instruments of the twentieth century
 yah kaary koran ke atirikt kisi anya kitaab ne kiya ho to vishwa uskaa naam jaananaa chahega
 This miraculous form of the Qur'an is for us today and may be another miraculous form of it for the time to come
 jis samay koran avtarit hua us yug main uskaa mukhya chamatkaar uskaa vaigyanik aadhaar nahin tha
 The miracle of the Quran in that era was its language, literature, eloquence, which shook the language knowledge of the Arabs of its time
 yahaan spasht karnaa uchit hoga ki us samay ke arabon ko apane bhashaa gyaan par itnaa garv tha ki ve shesh vishwa ke logon ko ajami kehete the
 Due to the style of the Qur'an, the Arabic linguists fell on their knees
 koran aisi kitaab he jiske aadhaar par ek kranti laai gai
 Such illiterate people of the desert who had no importance in the world map at that time
 koran kii shikshaaon ke kaaran, uske prastutakarta kii training ne unhe us samay kii mahaan shaktiyon ke samaksh laa khadaa kiya or ek aise korani samaaj kii rachana maatr 23 varshon main kii gai jiskaa uttar vishwa kabhi nahin de saktaa
 Even today, the world believes that the Quran and Hazrat Muhammad created an ideal society
 is drushti se yadi koran kaa adhyayan kiya jaae to aapako uske saath qadam mila kar chalanaa hoga
 Follow his education
 keval nijee jivan main hi nahin balki saamaajik, rajnatik or kanoonee kshaitron main, tab aapke samaksh ve saare charitra jo koran main varnit hai, jivit nazar aaenge
 All those difficulties and all those problems will come to the fore
 tan, man, dhan, se jo giroh is kaary ke liye uthe to koran kii hidaayat har mode par uskaa maarg darshan karegi
 The Quran is the rope of Allah
 is bare main tiramizi main hazarat zayd bin araqam dwaara varnit haddees he jisamen kaha gaya he ki koran allaah kii rassi he jo zamin se asaman tak tani he
 The word is from Hazur, described by Hazrat Zaid
 There is another hadith mentioned in Tabrani, which states that one day when a person was brought to the Hazur Mosque, he saw some people reading the Quran sitting in a corner and explaining to each other
 yah dekh kar aap ke chehre par khushi kii lahar daud gai
 You reached that group of Sahaba and said to them - Do you believe that there is no other Mabud besides Allah, i am the Messenger of Allah and the Qur'an is the Book of Allah? Sahaba said, or Rasul Allah we testify that there is no Mabud except Allah, you are the Rasool of Allah and the Quran is the Book of Allah
 tab aapane kaha, khushiyaan manaao ki koran allaah kii vah rassi he jiskaa ek sira uske haath main he or doosraa tumhaare haath main
 In the same way, there are many more
 koran allaah kii rassi is arth main bhi he ki yah musalamaanon ko aapas main baandh kar rakhata he
 The unity of ideas in them, at the time of differentiation, presents a perfect model for judgment and life by the orders of Allah
 It is in the Qur'an itself to hold the rope of Allah firmly
 koran ke mul aadhaar par musalamaanon ke kisi gut main koi takaraav nahin he
 The Right to the Qur'an has five rights on every Muslim of the Qur'an, which he should fulfill according to his power and ability
 koran ko samajhane ke liye uske avateern kii prishth bhoomi jaananaa zaruri he
 This is not the kind of book that has been written in full and given to the Prophet that he should go and call people
 balki koran thodaa thodaa us kranti ke avasar par jo hazarat mohammad ne arab main aarambh kii thi, aavashyaktaa ke anusaar avatarit kiya gaya
 From the beginning, as soon as some part of the Qur'an descended, you would write it down and also tell with whom it would be read
 avateern ke kram se vidwaanon ne koran ko do bhaagon main baanta he
 One is the Makki portion, the other the Madni part
 aarambh main makke main choti choti suuratein nazil huin
 His language was superior, effective and of the highest literary rank according to the Arabs' preference
 uske bol dilon main utar jate the
 With his divine music, ears would listen to him and his divine light would get people attracted or nervous
 isamen sristi ke ve niyam varnit kiye gaye jin par sadiyon ke baad ab bhi maanav aashcharya chakit he, kintu iske liye saare udhaaharan sthaneey the
 Their history, their atmosphere
 aisa paanch varsh tak chalata rahaa
 After this, the people who occupied the political and economic power of Mecca, sensed this danger for themselves, that they had to leave their homes and die in the small number of Muslims
 khud nabi ko ek ghati main saare parivarajanon ke saath qaid rahanaa padaa or ant main makka chhod kar madina janaa padaa
 This was a very tough time for the Muslims and the Qur'an revealed by Allah at this time was the cutting of the sword and the speed of the flood
 jisane puraa kshaitra hilaa kar rakh diya
 There are consolations for Muslims and prayers during this difficult time, which was the main part of this eight-year Quran
 is hinsaatmak prakaran se spasht hota he ki maanviya rachanadharmita evam bhaawanaaon kaa prabhaav is granth kii rachana main rahaa
 Thirteen years after the Makki era, Muslims found a center in Medina
 jahaan saare imaan laane waalon ko ekatrit kar tisare daur kaa avateern shuru hua
 Here Muslims were introduced to two new types of people
 pratham yahudee jo yahan sadiyon se aabaad the or apane dharmik vishwaas ke anusaar antim nabi kii pratiksha kar rahe the
 But when he saw the last prophet in his second demise, he created a ruckus
 koran main is daur main ahale kitaab par koran main sakht tippaniyan kii gayi
 In this era, a group of malicious people was born among the Muslims who pretended to be Muslims and kept meeting their opponents
 yaheen musalamaanon ko sashastr sangharsh kii ajna mili or unhen nirantar makka vaasiyon ke hamalon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 On the other hand, with the establishment of an Islamic state, the divine rules were created for the creation of the whole society
 yudhd, shanti, nyaay, samaajik reeti rivaaj, khan paan sabake bare main ishwar ke aadesh is yug ke koran kii visheshta hai
 On the basis of which Rasul of Allah created an ideal state of social equality
 jiske aadhaar par aaj sadiyon baad bhi hazarat mohammad kaa kram vishwa nayakon main pratham mana jaataa he
 He did not give verbal instructions in every field of life, but showed it by following it
 is prishth bhoomi ke kaaran hi koran main kai baar ek hi baat ko baar baar doharaaya janaa lagata he
 Monotheism, religious order, heaven, hell, patience, religion are subjects of perennialism that were repeated again and again
 koran ne ek sidhe saadhe, nek vyapaaree insaan ko, jo apane parivaar main ek bharpoor jivan guzaar rahaa tha
 He stood before the two great powers of the world
 keval yahi nahin usne registan ke anpadh logon ko aisa sabhy bana diya ki puure vishwa par is sabhyataa kii chhap se saikadon varshon baad bhi peechha nahin chhudaaya ja saktaa
 The Quran presented the ideals of war, peace, state governance, family, which have influence in human society today

 After studying them, he said that the descriptions in the Quran regarding embryology are exactly in line with modern discoveries
 kuch aayaton ke bare main unhone kaha ki ve ise galat yaa sahi nahin kah sakate kyon ki ve khud is baat main anbhigya hai
 It also included the first verse of the Qur'an that was translated

 aise saikadon udhaaharan hai jinhe koran kii is tikaa main aap nirantar padhenge
 There is a difference of opinion that when the Qur'an is such a siddha book, why do scholars differ from Hazrat Muhammad in his commentary so far
 yahaan itnaa kahana kaaphi hoga ki paigambar mohammad ne apane anuyaayiyon main sehatmand vibhed ko badhaava diya kintu matbhinnata ke aadhaar par kattarpan or gutbandi ko aapane pasand nahin kiya
 Healthy differences always help in the progress of society and factionalism always causes harm

 The literal verse Qur'an descended on Hazrat Muhammad, in divine words
 yah vahya shabdic he, arth ke rup main nahin
 This has to be clarified that in Christian educational institutions, it is taught that it is not in divine words but on the heart of the prophet that he describes it in his own words
 isaiyon ke liye yah vishwaas isliye zaruri he ki bibil main jo badlaav unhone kiye hai, use ve isi prakaar satya bataa sakate the
 The entire Christian and Jewish world has been trying for centuries to somehow prove that the Qur'an is the words of Hazrat Muhammad and is his creation

 Abi Gamin or Ibi Gamin is a high mountain situated in the Garhwal Himalayan division of the Himalayas, a tributary of the Kamet Mountains
 iskaa adhikansh bhaag bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke chamoli zile main he or kuch uttari ansh tibet ke ngaari vibhaag main aata he
 According to the definition based on topographic verticality, if the lower mountains of the two peaks are connected to each other and one of them has a higher height and the other one has an independent elevation of less than 500 meters, then the other one should not be considered as a mountain, instead of the former

 Whereas Arabs got this knowledge from India
 bhartiya ank pranali main shunya ko mila kar kul 10 ank hote hai
 The Indian numeral system is the most popular numeral system in the world
 france ke prasiddh ganitagya piyare simon laplas ke anusaar, Devanagari and international forms of Indian numerals are shown below- itihaaskaaron ke anusaar isa purv chauthi shatabdi main bharat main brahmi ankon kaa prachlan tha
 Brahmi numerals have been found in inscriptions found in caves in the Pune and Mumbai regions and in ancient coins found in Uttar Pradesh
 brahmi ankon main dashamalav pranali tathaa shunya kaa prayog nahin hota tha
 According to apocalyptic documents, zero in India, which is the basis of the decimal system, was invented in the first century CE
 kintu bharat main shunya ke avishkaar ke pramanik dastauez paanchavi shatabdi main hi mili hai
 The inscriptions found in Gwalior, dating back to 870 CE, contain signs of zero
 is shilaalekh ko sabhi itihaaskaaron ne ek mat se manyata di he
 With the invention of zero, the practice of the ten digit number system started in India which became the basis of modern number systems prevalent in this world
 isvi san ke saatvin shatabdi main arab ne bhartiya ank pranali kaa abhigrahan kar liya
 Indian numerals in Arabia became known as Gubar numerals and Indian numeral system known as Hindusa numeral system
 hindustan se is ank pranali ke praapt hone ke kaaran hi vahaan ise 'hindusa' naam diya gaya
 According to the chronological account of a scholar named Muhammad ibn Musa al-khwarizmi of Arabia, europe main barahavin shatabdi tak roman ankon kaa prayog hota tha
 The Roman numeral system has only seven digits, expressed by letters
 ye aksharank hai- I, V, X, L, C, d tathaa m 
 Any number is written by subtracting the sum of these digits
 udhaaharan ke liye agar teen likhnaa he to ek kaa chinh teen baar likh diya III
 If eight is to be written, three to the right of five are added by writing the signs of each one and it becomes VIII
 yah pranali itani kathin or uljhi hui he ki jab barahavin shatabdi main europe kaa bhartiya ank pranali se parichay hua to usne use sweekaar hi nahin kiya, apitu ekadam apana liya
 The scientific-industrial revolution that took place in Europe after a few centuries, has contributed to the calculation of Indian numerals
 bharat ne gananaa hetu nau ankon tathaa shunya kaa avishkaar kiya tha
 Not only this, the local value of numbers was also invented in India
 shunya kaa koi maan nahin he kintu use agar ek ank ke dahini ore likh diya jaae to vah das ingit karegaa kyonki ab 1 kaa sthaneey maan das ho gaya
 If one more zero is increased to the right, this number will be hundred
 is tarah ank ke dahini ore likhe jane par moolyaheen shunya, duusare ankon kaa mulya badha detaa he
 In short, the principle of pricing digits by place is called local value
 is pranali se kisi bhi sankhya ko likhnaa bahut aasaan he
 The three hundred forty-four which we write in the Roman system as CCC XL IV, can be written 344 by Indian law
 is madhyam se badi se badi sankhya bina kisi kathinaayee ke sankshep main likhi ja sakati he
 Indian mathematics also invented the decimal system
 bharat main dashamalav ankon kaa sarvapratham prayog aryabhatta pratham dwaara miltaa he
 It is possible that it was invented much earlier
 kint europe main dashamalav ank kaa saamaanya prachaar satrahavin shatabdi main hua, jiskaa gyaan nishchit hi usne bharat se praapt kiya tha
 These Indian mathematical principles were acquired through Europe to Arabia
 arabi bhashaa main in ankon ko hindasa kehete hai
 Hindsa means 'derived from Hind'
 arabi lipi daaen se baayen likhi jaati he, kintu arabi main ank baayen se daayen likhe jate hai
 This is also evidence that Arabic numerals did not originate in the Arab country with the Arabic language, but are imported from outside
 arabon ke madhyam se jab yah bhartiya ank europe pahunche to unh laga ki ye ank mul rup se arabon dwaara hi avishkaar kiye gaye hai
 Therefore, even today, in Europe, the Indian numerals from one to nine and zero are called 'arabic Numericals'
 islam ke paigambar hazrat mohammad ke purv arab desh main jihalia arthath 'agyaan kaa yug' kaha jaataa he
 There was no progress in knowledge science
 puure kurash kabeeley main, jisase mohammad sahab kaa sambandh tha, keval satraa log kuch likhnaa jaanate the
 But with the establishment of Islam, the Arab Empire expanded to the borders of Spain and North Africa in the west and India in the east
 jo desh parajeet hokar arab samrajya main shaamil hue, unke aarthik prashasan ke liye arabi gananaa-pranali, jo ki atyant praarambhik str kii thi, aparyaapt siddh hui
 Therefore, the Arab rulers were forced to use the numbers of the conquered castes
 khalipha al mansoor ke rajyakaal ke samay main sindh se kuch doot baghdad gaye, jinamein kuch vidwaan bhi the
 He also took with him Brahmasputa siddhanta composed by Brahmagupta and a treatise called Khandakhadyaka along with other texts in Baghdad
 in vidwaanon kii sahaayta se al-fajari evam yaqub khan tarik ne inkaa arabi main anuwaad kiya, jiskaa arabi ganit par vishesh prabhaav padaa
 The respect that Arab people had for Indian knowledge, science and art at that time, is written in al-zahij's booklet - Fakir assam-sudan al-lah binad: pisa nagar ke leonado ne, jisane kisi moore se hindu ganit siikhaa or san 1202 main liber evaiki naamak pustak likhi, jiskaa sanshodhit sanskaran san 1228 main aayaa
 In this, he explained Hindu numerals and their utility
 alekjad r de viladi or jaan aak heliphaks kii pustakon ne bhi ‘hindu ank pranali’ kaa prasar kiya
 Initially it was opposed, but by the middle of the fifteenth century it was accepted by all the countries of Europe
 anya european deshon ne bhartiya ank pranali ko arab se siikhaa
 Since they got this numeral system from Arabia, they named it 'arabic numeral system'
 itihaas kaa sahi gyaan hone ke baad ab ise 'hindu-arabic ank' yaa 'hindu ankapranali' yaa 'bhartiya ankapranali' kaha jane laga he
 There have been many changes in the sign of the Indian numeral system from time to time and country to country
 ant main in ankon kaa swaroop 0, 1, 2, 3, xxrep 4 
 ke rup main ho gaya or inhen anterrashtriya manyata mil gai
 Modern numerals and numeral systems are actually Indian
 vartmaan main in aadhunik ankon ko "bhartiya ankon kaa antararashtriya rup" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Ventilators are devices that are powered by the power of a gas
 sampidit gas kisi gas sampidak se praapt kiya jaataa he
 The ventilators are often cheaper than the electrically operated ones and their use and maintenance are more secure
 iske alaava inkaa shakti or bhaar kaa anupaat adhik hota he jisase kisi kaam ke liye apekshaakrit chote evam halkaa upkaran se hi kaam ho jaataa he
 In modern industrial works, by creating a variety of devices driven by the power contained in atmospheric pressure and compressed air by creating vacuum, many types of works are done by it, which saves human labor and time and works better with great convenience
 19veen shatabdi ke madhyottar kaal main hawa kii shakti tathaa vidyut shakti ke prayog main ek prakaar se badi spardhaa si ho gai thi
 The power contained in both can be used at a great distance from the power-producing center, conveniently
 lekin ab hawa tathaa bijli ek duusare kii sahaayak hokar, audyogic kaaryon ke liye vardaan swaroop ho gai hai
 In very large expansive factories, the power produced by hydroelectric plants located hundreds of kilometers away is driven by motors, and through them running special types of works from various types of ventilators, by running wind compressors or vacuum devices
 jahaajon ke nirmaan tathaa marammat ke kaaryon main tathaa sanrachaneey ejiniyari ke kaamon main, jab chhede athwa kaati janevaali vastu kaarkaane ke saadhaaran sthaayee yantropkarnon par nahin laai ja sakati, tab vishesh vaatil upkarnon se unpar, jahaan vah he usee sthaan par, kaam kar diya jaataa he
 The same thing can be done by lifting electrically wires where there are electrophoresis, but in doing so, even a slight inadvertence can result in death due to electric shock
 vaatil upkarnon ke upyog main is prakaar kaa koi dar nahin rahata
 The ventilator system is a great boon for the work of mines, because the ventilation of mines is also corrected by the air released after working in them
 vaatil pranali se anek prakaar ke vaahitr banaakar vishesh paristhitiyon main saamaan idhar se udhar le jaaya jaataa he, bojha uthaaya jaataa he or kuen se pani khinchaa jaataa he
 In casting mines, many instruments work only through the ventilator system
 hawaii motor yukt havis kai naapon main banaaya jaataa he, jiske dwaara 200 kigra
 se lekar 9,000 kigra
 tak bojha uthaaya ja saktaa he
 It is powered by four cylinders with powerful motors driven by compressed air of 80 to 100 pounds per square inch of pressure
 yah motor pehle daahine haath kii taraf lage giyaron ko chalaati he jinase sambandhit bich main laga drum ghumta he jisapar bojhe kii rassi lipatati yaa khulti he
 The advantage in this is that the brakes automatically brake as soon as the air pressure in the motor is stopped, so that the load can be stopped anywhere in the middle and as soon as the compressed air is opened to lift or unload the load, a tube By reaching the brake device, it removes the block of brake
 is prakaar ke havis nirmaan kaarkaanon main baari saamaan uthaane, dharne or workshaap main kharad, milling, tathaa planing mashiinon par lagaae jate hai
 In standing or horizontal cylindrical vents, a piston works by crushing it with the pressure of compressed air
 yah bhi teen prakaar kaa hota he : ekakriyaatmak, dvikriyaatmak or santulit pistonyukt
 Balanced types of havis are used for casting in casting mines, closing molds, taking out the form from the mold, etc
, in which the delicate and brittle molds of clay are lifted without any shock
 is prakaar ke havis main hawa kii daab sadaiv piston ke neeche kii taraf bani rahati he, at: bojhe ko uthaane ke liye keval piston ke upar kii hawa ko nishkasit karnaa hota he or neeche utaarne ke liye upar kii taraf hawa bharani padati he, kyonki piston ke neeche kii taraf ke antaraal main pistondand bhi kuch jagah roktaa he, at: usamen prabhavakaari daab kam hone ke kaaran hi bojha dhire-dhire neeche utarataa he
 By removing and balancing the air above, you can stop the burden exactly where you want
 gantry athwa shiropari gardaron par lage thele se latakaakar bojhe sahit ise apni seemaa ke bheetar bheetar idhar se udhar bhi le ja sakate hai
 Its cylinders are made from 3 inches to 24 inches in diameter and the devices made according to different diameters can be driven by compressed air of 60 to 100 pounds per square inch of pressure
 24 inch vyas ke silinder se, 60 pound vayumandaleey daab par 24,430 pound, 80 pound vayumandaleey daab par 32,570 poundaur 100 pound vayumandaleey daab par 40,720 pound tak kaa bojha uthaaya ja saktaa he
 The molded box is placed on its horizontal horizontal cap with clay and furme
 is mej ke neeche ek piston laga he jo aadhaar par kase hue silinder main chalata he
 Compressed air enters the cylinder from the right-hand side, before which the stin rises 2-inches first, then when the air exits the left-hand side, the piston descends
 piston ke neeche kii taraf ek plunjar laga he jab vah aadhaar plate se takaraata he, tab piston par lagi teble or usapar lage saanche ko jhatka lagata he
 In this way, due to repeated rise and fall of the piston, the soil gets stuck in the mold
 is yantra ko chalaane ke liye 60 se 100 pound prati varg inch daab kii sampidit hawa kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 This device takes from 100 to 160 shocks per minute
 iske dwaara saanchaa banane ke liye farme ko board par lagaakar frem main rakh dete hai, phir farme ke chaaron taraf sahi baithanevaala saanchaa baks rakhkar usamen mitti bharkar prakanpak ke dwaara sampidit vaayu ke bal se mashin ko chalaakar saanche kii mitti ko baitha diya jaataa he
 Then, placing the board under the mold on top of the mold, tighten it with screws
 iske baad valve ko kholane se silinder main sampidit vaayu pravisht hokar frem ko is prakaar se sanchalit karti he ki usapar rakhaa saanchaa lautakar teble par funni kii sahaayta se sahi sahi sthaan par aa jaataa he, tab pehle ke baandhe hue shikanje khol liye jate hai or frem ko khadaa kar saanche main se farma bhi nikaal liya jaataa he
 The frame then returns to form the second mold on the right hand side
 is prakaar kii saanchaa mashine sampidit hawa ke bal se chalaai jaati hai jinka dhalikhanon main bahut upyog hota he
 They are also made able to be carried from here to there by placing them on the wheels
 yah ek uthoa prakaar ke yantra hotaa he
 By this, by running a stream of sand with the force of compressed air, the overcasting of the molded objects can be done easily, which removes the burnt soil and crusts on them and they appear smooth and polished
 dhali hui halaki vastuon ke liye 5 se 10 pound, madhyam darje kii baari vastuon ke liye 15 se 20 pound or dhale hue ispaat kii baari vastuon ke liye 30 se 75 pound prati varg inch daab kii sampidit vaayu kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 This useful device was invented in 1883 by an engineer named Boyer of Santlui, who made many improvements from the back
 yah isi main lagi daai ke anusaar rivaton ke maththe thokane ke liye hi uparyukt he
 The chipping hammer is also of this type
 antar keval yahi rahata he ki usamen rivat kii snap daai ke badale ek chheni lagi hoti he
 This tool is also similar in principle to an aerial hammer but is made of two types: one with a small handle and is used for digging tunnels at the places where the eggs are located
 doosraa lambey handls se yukt hota he tathaa vah khulaasa jagahon main or khaaiyaan khodne ke kam aata he
 This injury causes the soil to loose and disintegrate, because its plunger strikes a belled section, which causes it to penetrate into the soil
 farshatod bhi hawaii chheni ke samaan hi hota he jiskaa plunjar ek funninuma bhaag par chot karata he
 By this, the work of breaking old buildings is very easy, because through it a man can work equal to 12 men
 puraane dhang ke dhalikhanon main to saanchon kii mitti dabaane ke liye mungranuma duramuson kaa upyog hota he lekin aadhunik prakaar kaa hawaii duramus, jo kaaphi halkaa bhi hota he or 30 se 100 pound prati varg inch kii dabavaali sampidit hawa se chalata he; saadhaaran mungare kii apeksha lagbhag dyodha kaam bina kisi thakaavat ke kar detaa he
 By relating them to the thin rubber of the rubber, a similar cropping can be done anywhere and in any condition, which does not show any defect on casting

 Name of some of the people doing pioneering work in the field of electrical decomposition - newton ke gati niyam teen bhautik niyam hai jo chirsmmat yantriki ke aadhaar hai
 These rules describe the relationship between the force exerted on an object and the speed of that object
 inhen teen sadiyon main anek prakaar se vyakt kiya gaya he
 Newton's three laws of motion, traditionally, are summarized as follows: sabase pehle newton ne inhe apane granth philasphi nechuralis principia mathematica main sankalit kiya tha
 Newton used them to explain the problems related to the motion of physical objects in many places
 apane granth ke tritiy bhaag main newton ne darshaya ki gati ke ye teenon niyam or unke saarvatrik gurutvkarshan kaa niyam sammilit rup se kepler ke akashiya pindon kii gati se sambandhit niyam kii vyakhya karne main samarth hai
 Newton's law of motion is applied only to those objects which we can consider as a particle
 matlab ki un vastuon kii gati ko napate samay unke aakar ko nazarandaz kiya jaataa he
 These rules are applied by considering the objects of those objects centered in a single point
 aisa tab kiya jaataa he jab vishleshan main dooriyaan vastuyon kii tulana main kaaphi bade hote he
 Therefore, the planets can be measured as a particle and their orbital speed can be measured
 apane mul rup main in gati ke niyamo ko drudh or virupanshil pindon par nahin lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In 1750, Leonard Euler expanded Newton's speed rules and created Euler's speed rules that could also be applied to rigid and deformable bodies
 yadi ek vastu ko asatat kanon kaa ek sangyojan mana jaye, jiname alag-alag kar ke newton ke gati niyam lagaaye ja sakate he, to ular ke gati niyam ko newton ke gati niyam se viyuttpann kiya ja saktaa he
 Newton's laws of motion also apply in some direction systems, called inertial direction systems
 kai lekhako kaa maananaa he ki pratham niyam jadtviya nirdesh tantra ko paribhaashit karata he or dwitiya niyam sirf unhi nirdesh tantron se main maanya he isi kaaran se pehle niyam ko dusre niyam kaa ek vishesh rup nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 But some consider the first rule to be the result of the second
 nirdesh tantron kii spasht avadharana newton ke marane ke kaaphi samay pashchaat viksit hui
 Newtonian mechanics has now been replaced by Einstein's theory of special relativity, but it is still used for objects at a speed less than the speed of light
 newton ke mul shabdon main Hindi translation "prayek vastu apane sthiravastha athwa ekasmaan vegavastha me tab tak rahati he jab tak use kisi bahya kaarak dwaara avasthaa main badlaav ke liye prerit nahin kiya jaataa
 " duusare shabdon main, jo vastu viraam avasthaa main he vah viraam avasthaa main hi rahegi tathaa jo vastu gatiman hai vah gatiman hi rahegi jab tak ki us par bhi koi bahari bal naa lagaaya jaae
 Newton's first law defines inertia, a natural property of matter that opposes changes in momentum
 isliye pratham niyam ko jadtv kaa niyam bhi kehete he
 This rule also indirectly defines the inertial reference system and force
 iske kaaran newton dwaara is niyam ko pratham rakhaa gaya
 Simple authentication of this rule is difficult because the bodies feel the effects of friction and gravity
 asal main newton se pehle galileo ne is prekshan kaa varnan kiya
 Newton expressed it in other words
 newton ke mul shabdo main : Translation in hindi " kisi vastu ke samveg me aayaa badlaav us vastu par aropit dhakke ke samaanupati hota he tathaa samaan disha main ghatit hota he
 "the following points can be arranged by Newton's law: jahaan f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} bal, p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} samveg or t { \ displaystyle t} samay hai
 According to this equation, when there is no external force on a body, the momentum of the body remains constant
 jab pind kaa dravyaman sthir hota he, to sameekaran zyaada saral rup main likhaa ja saktaa he: Where m { \ displaystyle m} is mass and a → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {a}}} is acceleration
 yani kisi pind kaa twaran aropit bal ke anukramanupati he
 The impulse relates to the Second Rule
 aaveg kaa matlab he samveg main parivartan
 meaning: jahaan i aaveg he
 Very important in the analysis of impulse collisions
 mana ki kisi pind kaa dravyaman m he
 Applying a rule force f to this for ान्तt time period, the velocity changes to ∆v
 tab newton- Therefore, the impulse given to a body is similar to the change in momentum produced in the body
 at: aaveg kaa maatrak vahi hota he jo samveg kaa he
 The third law means that there is another force corresponding to a force that is equal and opposite to it
 newton ne is niyam ko istemaal karke samveg sangrakshan ke niyam kaa varnan kiya, lekin asal main samveg sangrakshan ek adhik moolbhoot siddhant he
 There are many examples in which momentum is preserved but the third rule is not valid
 toli-pa0mani03, paudi tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat gadhwal mandal ke paudi jile kaa ek gaanv he
 a radical is a group of elements that behaves like a chemical element in compounds
 yogicon main yah kisi tatv kaa sthaan le saktaa he athwa use visthapit kar saktaa he
 The basement has an unconnected fraternity, so that it is not generally permanent in the disjoint condition, although some radicals, such as carbonyl and nitrosyl, have been found to be unconnected

 Prohibitionism is generally presented as the most existential / existential negativism that argues that life has no meaningful meaning, reason or real significance
 ise maanane vaale nilist jor de kar kehete hai he ki naitikta swaabhaavik rup se maujuud nahin hoti, tathaa kisi bhi prakaar ke sthapit kiye gaye naitik mulya kritrim rup se banaaye gayi hai
 Prohibitionism can also be in the form of philosophicalism, spiritualism, or theism, which means that knowledge is not possible in some forms or contrary to our belief, thus some aspects of reality do not exist
 nishedhwaad shabd ko kai baar aadarshon kii kami ke saath jod kar astitv kii kathith nirarthakta ke kaaran hui niraashaa kii saamaanya manodasha main yah samajhane ke liye prayog liya jaataa he ki koi yah samaj kar vikaas kar saktaa he ki koi adarsh, niyam yaa kanoon nahin hai
 Futurism and extermination, along with other movements, have been identified by commentators as "nihilistic" in various contexts at various times
 nishedhwaad ek ek visheshta bhi he jise, kai samay avadhiyon ke liye jimmedaar mana gaya he, udhaaharan ke liye, jin boudryllard or anyon ne aadhuniktaa ke baad ke yug ko shoonyavaadee yug mana he or kuch isai brahmavigyaniyon or dharmik guruon dwaara ekatrit aankadon ne is baat par jor diya he ki aadhuniktaa ke baad kaa yug or iske kai pahalu aastikta ko nakaarne kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai or kaha ki is tarah kii asweekruti ek prakaar ke nishedhwaad ko hi badhaava dene ke samaan he
 Although the term prohibitionism was first brought to fame by novelist Ivan Turgenev's novel Fathers and Sons, it was introduced as a philosophical article by Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi
 jaikobi ne is shabd ko buddhivadke liye or vishesh rup se immanual kaant ke "aalochanatmak" darshanashastra ke betukepan ko khatm karne ke liye prayukt kiya, jiske anusaar sabhi prakaar ke buddhivaad nishedhwaad main kam ho jate hai or is prakaar isse bachaa janaa chahie tathaa ise kisi prakaar kii shraddha tathaa rahasyodghatan se badla janaa chahie
 udhaaharan ke liye, brett dablyoo davis likhte hai, "nishedhwaad ke darshanik vikaas ke vichaar ko shuru karne ke aamtaur par fredrick jaikobi ko jimmedaar mana jaataa he, jinhonen ek prasiddh paatr main fishe ke adarshavaad ke nishedhwaad ke rup main badalane kii aalochana kii he
 According to Jacoby, Fishe's ego perfection promotes a type of psychism that completely negates the superiority of God
 ek sambandhit avadharana anternihit vishwaasavad he
 After Turgenev brought prohibitionism to fame, a new Russian political movement adopted the term as the prohibitionism movement
 He probably called himself nihilistic since "nothing" had gained an honor in his eyes
 sorain kiyarkeguard ne shuruuaati nishedhwaad kii aadharshila rakhi jise vah levlinga kahata tha
 Leveling was a process whereby the personality was suppressed to the point where the uniqueness of the personality became ineffective and nothing in its existence remained meaningful
 kiyarkeguard, jo jivan ke darshan kaa samarthak tha, aam taur par levlinga or iske vinashwadi prabhaav ke khilaaf tark detaa tha, yadhyapi vah maanata tha ki "barabari ke yug main rahanaa aamtaur par atyant shikshaprad hoga log ke nirnay kaa akele saamana karne ke liye majaboor kiye jaayenge
 jorge kotkin kehete hai ki unnisvin sadi main kiyarkeguard "vishwaas ke maanakeekaran or barabari kaa, aadhyatmik or raajnneetik donon roopon main, virdohi tha samuhik rup se vyakti vishesh kii anurupata ko shunya par laane va prabhaavshaalee raay kaa sammaan karne kii samskruti kii pravrattiyon kaa virodh kiya
 In those days magazines and corrupt Christianity were the means of leveling and were responsible for making 19th century Europe a "reflective indifferent" era
 kiyarkeguard kaa tark he ki jo vyakti levlinga prakriya se baahar aane main sakasham hai, ve iske liye samarth hai or yah unka "sachcha nijee vyaktitv banane" kii sahi disha main ek kadam he
 Because we must come out of the leveling, Hubert Dreyfuss and Jane Rubin argue that Kierkegaard is interested in "how in the increasingly pessimistic era, how can we find the sense that our lives are meaningful"
 haalanki yah dhyaan diya janaa chahie nishedhwaad ke sandarbh main kiyarkeguard kaa matlab aadhunik paribhaasha se in arthon main alag he ki kiyarkeguard ke liye levlinga jivan ke abhaav arthon, kaaran, mulyon ko pradarshit karti he jabaki aadhunik paribhaasha ke anusaar jivan ke liye armbh se hi koi arth, kaaran yaa mahatva nahin tha
 Prohibitionism is often seen in association with the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who has extensively studied prohibitionism in Western civilization
 yadhyapi aamtaur par nitshe ke puure kaam ke bare main aksar yah dikhaai detaa he, ki unhonen is shabd ko vibhinn tareekon, sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak arthon or atirikt arthon ke liye prayukt kiya
 a common way in which they interpret prohibitionism is "a state of tension created by the asymmetry between what we want and the world's response"
 When we find that the outside world does not have the objective significance or meaning we seek, or has long believed that it happens, we find ourselves in trouble
 nitshe kaa daawa he ki isai dharm main giravat or shaareerik patan hone ke kaaran, nishedhwaad vastav main aadhunik yug kii ek visheshta he, haalanki uskaa taatpary he ki nishedhwaad kaa abhi bhi puraa udai nahin hua he or iskaa puri tarah kaamyaab hona abhi baaki he
 Although the problem of prohibitionism has been specifically expressed in Nietzsche's Notebook, it has been repeatedly stated in the books published by him and is closely linked to many of the problems mentioned in it
 nitshe ne nishedhwaad ko duniya khaali karne or vishesh rup se maanav astitv ke arth, uddeshy, subodh sach he, yaa aavashyak mulya ke rup main paribhaashit kiya he
 The basic source of this interpretation stems from Nietzsche's perspective or his belief that everyone has knowledge of something, it is surrounded by possibility and is never just a fact
 Rather, we understand the world and interpret it through multiple interpretations
 vyakhya ke bina ham kahin aage nahin bad sakate, apitu vastav main yah kuch aisa he jisaki hamen aavashyaktaa he
 One way of interpreting the world is morality, a fundamental way in which people find the meaning of the world, especially in relation to their thoughts and actions
 Nietzsche explains the difference in strong or healthy morality, that is, the person in question knows that he has made himself out of weak morality, where the interpretation is done externally
 takat ke bajaay, naitikta hamen arth pradaan karti he, chaahe banaai gayi ho yaa "samavisht kii" gayi ho, jisase hame jivan jeene main madad milti he
 This is why Nietzsche as "utterly useless" or "means nothing" is prohibitively dangerous, or even "a threat to dangers"
 moolyankan ke sahare hi log nirvaah karte hai or jivan main khataron, dard tathaa kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karte hai
 Complete destruction of all meanings and values will be like suicide or mass murder
 nitshe apane kaam main mahatvapurn vishyon main se ek, isaai dharm par apni notebook main 'european nishedhwaad ' naamak adhyay main nishedhwaad kii samasya ke sandarbh ke vishay main vistaar se charchaa karata he
 Here he states that Christian moral doctrine gives people real values, belief in God) and provides a foundation for objective knowledge
 is arth main, ek aisi duniya ke nirmaan main, jahaan uddeshyaatmak gyaan sambhav he, isai dharm nishedhwaad ke moulik rup, arthhinata se upji niraashaa ke liye sanhaarak kaa kaam karata he
 However, it is in fact an element of the truthfulness of Christian doctrine, that is, the destruction of oneself: in its drive to the truth, Christianity eventually finds itself as a construct that is going toward its own dissolution
 isliye nitshe ne kaha he ki ham isiyat ke paar chale gayi hai " isliye nahin ki ham isse bahut dur rahete hai, balki isliye ki ham iske bahut nazadik tahate hai
 "in this way, the self-styled dissolution of Christianity constitutes another form of prohibitionism
 kyonki isaiyat ek vyakhya thi jisane swayan ko vyakhya kii sthiti main rakhaa, nitshe kaa kahana he ki yah vighatan sanshaywad se pare sabhi arthon ke vinaash kii ore le jaataa he
 Stanley Rozen knows Nietzsche's concept of prohibitionism from a state of meaninglessness where "everything is allowed"
 According to him, the loss of high spiritual values, which exist contrary to the reality of the world or the basis of human mere thought, gives rise to the idea that all human thoughts are meaningless
 adarshavaad ko nakaarne ke parinamswaroop nishedhwaad kaa udai hota he, kyonki isi tarah keval utkrisht adarsh un pichley maanakon tak rahenge jinhen ki shoonyavaadee abhi tak antarnihit uljhaav ke kaaran maanate hai
 The inability of Christianity as a source for evaluating the world is reflected in Nietzsche's famous proverb of the madman in 'the Gay Science'
 ishwar kii maut, visheshtayah yah katha ki "hamane use maaraa", ek tarah se isai siddhant ke swayan-bhu vighatan ke hi samaan he : vigyaan ke vikaas ke kaaran, jiske liye nitshe ne dikhaaya ki manushya vikaas kaa utpaada he, prithvi kaa sitaron main koi vishesh sthaan nahin he or itihaas pragatisheel nahin he, ishwar kii isai dharna naitikta ke aadhaar ke rup main lambey samay tak nahin rah sakati
 One form of reaction to losing this meaning is what Nietzsche calls 'passive negativism', which according to Schopenhauer's pessimistic philosophy
 shopenhoir kaa siddhant, jise nitshe pashchimi buddha dharm bhi kahata he, pidaa se bachane ke liye ichchhaaon or jaruraton se alag hone kii vakaalat karata he
 Nietzsche sees this rigid view as "the desire to do nothing" where life begins to distance itself from it, since the value of nothing is seen in the world
 Erasing all the values of the world is characteristic of the nihilist, although in this, the nihilist seems unfair
 nitshe kaa nishedhwaad kii samasya se jatil sambandh he
 He sees the problem of prohibitionism as a deep personality, saying that this problem of the modern world is a problem that has become "conscious" of it
 iske alaava, vah nishedhwaad ke khatre or iske dwaara pradaan kii jane vaali sambhaavnaaon par jor detaa he, jaisaa ki uske kathan main dekha gaya he "main prashansa karata hoon, main aagaman kaa tiraskaar nahin karata 
 meraa maananaa he ki yah bade sankaton main se ek he, ek pal, jo maanavtaa kaa gaharaa aatm pratibimb he
 Whether man can overcome this, whether he can control this crisis, it depends on his strength! ”according to Nietzsche, prohibitionism can only be defeated if culture has a true foundation on which it thrives
 They wished it to happen early so that they could remove it quickly
 unhone kaha ki kam se kam isaiyat ke vighatan ke falswaroop ek or prakaar ke nilist ke udai hone kii sambhaavna he, ek aisa jo sabhi mulyon or arthon ke vinaash ke baad nahin rukta or nakaaratmakataa ke adheen ho jaataa he
 In this alternative, or in other words 'active' prohibitionism destroys the ground of some new construction
 is prakaar ke nishedhwaad ko nitshe dwaara "shakti kaa sanket" kaha gaya he, apni ichha se nai shuruyaat karne ke liye puraane mulyon ko jad se mitaanaa or swayan ke vishwaas or vyakhyaayein sthapit karnaa, niskriy nishedhwaad ke vipareet jo puraane mulyon ke vighatan ke saath swayan kaa parityag kar detaa he
 Destruction of these values and coming out of the state of prohibitionism by creating new meanings, this active prohibitionism can be called another definition of Nietzsche as "free spirit" or Ubermensch in The Spoke Zarathustra and The Antichrist, a strong man who The self determines its values and lives its life in such a way that it should be an art
 kai aadhuniktaavaadi vichaarak jinhone nitshe dwaara uthaai gayi nishedhwaad kii samasya kii jaanch kii he, martin hidagar dwaara nitshe kii vyakhya se prabhavit the
 Recently it has happened that Heidegger's influence on Nietzsche's research of prohibitionism has faded
 1930 ke dashak ke shuru main, hidagar nitshe ke vichaaron par vyaakhyaan detaa tha
 Given Nietzsche's contribution to prohibitionism, Heidegger's influential interpretation of Nietzsche is important in the historical development of the term prohibitionism
 hidagar kaa nitshe ke vishay main shodh karne tathaa shiksha dene kaa dhang purna rup se uskaa apana hi he
 He does not make any special attempt to present Nietzsche as Nietzsche
 Instead, he tries to integrate Nietzsche's ideas into his own philosophical system of existence, time and presence
 uski nishedhwaad age ditormind by da history of beeing main, hidagar nitshe ke nishedhwaad ko is dhang se samajhane kaa prayaas karata he maano us samay ke sarvocch molyon ke avamulyan dwaara jeet hasil karne kii koshish kar rahaa ho
 hidagar ke anusaar, is avamulyan kaa siddhant, shakti ke liye ichha he
 The will of power is also the principle of valuing every initial value
 yah avamulyan kaise hota he or yah shoonyavaadee kyon he? darshan par hidagar kii mukhya aalochanaon main se ek darshan or vishesh rup se kahen to aadhyatmavaad astitv or astitv kii dharna ke bich bhed karnaa bhul gaya he
 According to Heidegger, the history of Western thought can be seen as the history of spiritualism
 or kyonki aadhyatmavaad astitv kii dharna ke vishay main poochna bhul gaya he kahata he
 This is not a victory over Nietzsche's spiritualism, but its accuracy
 nitshe ke bare main apni vyakhya main, hidagar ernest janger se prabhavit rahe hai
 Many references to Junger can be seen in lectures on Heidegger's Nietzsche
 udhaaharan ke liye, janger se prabhavit ho kar 4 navambar,1945 ko freeberg uniwarsity ke rector ko likhe gayi patr main, hidagar "ishwar mar chukaa he" kii dharna ko "shakti kii ichha kii sachai" ke rup main vyakhya karne kii koshish karata he
 Heidegger also praises Junger for defending against excessive biology or reading anthropology during Nietzsche's third reign
 kai mahatvapurn aadhunik vichaarak hidagar dwaara nitshe kii vyakhya se prabhavit the
 Gianni Waitimo points to a mutual movement in European thought between Nietzsche and Heidegger
 1960 ke dashak ke dauraan, ek nitshe aadhaarit 'punarjagran' shuru hua, jo mazino montinari or jorgio coli ke kaary dwaara samaapt hua
 He created a new and complete collection of collected works by Nietzsche, making it easier for researchers to access Nietzsche for research
 vatimo bataate hai ki coli or montinari ke is naye sanskaran ke saath, hidagar dwaara nitshe ke sambandh main kii gayi vyakhya ne ek aalochanatmak pratikriya kaa aakaar lenaa shuru kar diya
 anya samakaleen french or italvi darshanikon kii tarah, nitshe ko samajhane ke liye vatimo hidagar par nirbhar nahin rahanaa chaahate athwa keval aanshik rup se chaahate hai
 On the other hand, according to Waitimo, Heidegger's motives are sufficiently authentic to follow him
 darshanik jinhen vatimo is paraspar vichaardhaara kii misaal ke rup main pesh karata hai ve hai french darshanik delues, foocolt or derydow isi vichaardhaara ke italvi darshanikon main kastori, severino or vah khud hai
 Habermas, Lyotard and Rorty are also philosophers influenced by Heidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche
 aadhuniktaa ke baad or sanrachnawad ke baad kaa vichaar us aadhaar par prashn chinh lagaataa he jis par pashchimi sabhyataa kaa satya tikaa hua he : purna gyaan or arth, saahitiyik kaaryon kaa 'vikendrikaran', sakaaratmak gyaan kaa sanchay, aitihaasik vikaas, tathaa kuch adarsh or maanavtawaad va atmagyaan kaa abhyaas
 jaik darida, jiske vinaash ko aam taur par sabase adhik shoonyavaadee kaa darza diya gaya he, ne kabhi bhi swayan shoonyavaadee vichaardhaara kaa paalan nahin kiya he, jaisaa ki kuch log daawa karte hai
 Deridian annihilators argue that this approach exempts texts, individual or institutions, from speaking the restricted truth, and that such destruction opens the door to possibilities of other modes of existence
 udhaaharan ke liye gayatri chakravarti spivak, vinaash kaa upyog nitiyon ke nirmaan main karti he jo pashchimi shodharthiyon ko gulaami or pashchimi granthon kii kasuti ke baahar ke darshanashastra kii awaz se rubaru karaati he
 Derrida himself created a philosophy for himself on the basis of 'responsibility for others', thus destruction cannot be seen as rejecting only the truth, but denying our ability to know the truth

 lotard kaa tark he ki, unke daavon ko sabit karne ke liye ek vastu-gat satya yaa paddati par bharosa karne kii bajaay, darshanik apane sach ko duniya kii kahani dwaara vaid tehraate hai, jo sambandhit kahaniyon kii umr tathaa pranali se pruthak karne yogya nahin he or jise lotard dwaara meta katha kaha jaataa he
 He then defines the modernist position as a rejection of both the meta narrative and the process of legitimacy by meta narrative
 "meta-katha ke badale hamane apane daavon ko vaid tehraane ke liye nayaa bhashaai khel banaaya he jo badalte hue rishton or asthir satyon par aadhaarit he, iname se kisi ke paas bhi param satya par ek dusre ko kuch kehane kaa visheshadhikaar praapt nahin he"
 satya kii asthirataa kii yah avadharana or arth nishedhwaad kii disha kii ore le jaataa he, haalanki lotard baad vaale se judane se rokte hai
 Postmodern theorist Jean Baudrillard has briefly written on prohibitionism from postmodernism to postmodernism in simulacara and simulation
 vah paakhandon ke rup main asli duniya kii vyakhyaaon ke vishyon par atak gaya jisase kii yah vaastavik duniya bani he
 The use of meaning was an important topic of discussion on Baudrillard's prohibitionism: nishedhwaad kii kai paribhaashaayen hai or isliye iskaa prayog swatantra vivaad-yogya darshanik sthitiyon kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya gaya
 Moral nihilism, also known as moral nihilism, is an ethics-beyond approach that morality does not reside in an objective truth, so no action is superior to another
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek naitik shoonyavaadee kahegaa ki kisi ko maarna, chaahe jo bhi kaaran ho, swaabhaavik rup se sahi yaa galat nahin he
 Some nihilists argue that there is no morality at all, but if there is, it is man-made and thus artificial creation, in which any particular or all meanings are related to various possible outcomes
 ek udhaaharan ke rup main, yadi koi kisi ko martha he, is tarah kaa shoonyavaadee bahes kar saktaa he ki swaabhaavik rup se hatya bura kaam nahin he, hamaari naitik manyataon kii vajah se swatantra rup se bura he, sirf isliye ki jis dhang se naitikta kaa kuch moulik virodhabhas ke rup main nirmaan kiya gaya he, bure kaam ko achche kaam kii apeksha main nakaaratmak darza diya gaya he : parinamswaroop, vyakti kii hatya bura kaam tha kyonki isane vyakti ko jivit nahin rahane diya, jise ki manamaane dhang se sakaaratmak darza diya gaya tha
 In this way moral nihilists think that all moral claims are false
 astitvaparak shoonyavad ek vishwaas he ki jivan kaa koi vaastavik arth yaa mulya nahin he
 It can be banned only by scientific analyzes showing that only physical laws have contributed to our existence
 brahmad ke sandarbh main, uddeshy ke bina ek maanav yaa yahan tak ki puri maanav prajati kaa koi mahatva nahin he or astitv kii samagrata main iske badalane kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Ordinarily, nihilists in this regard believe that the only purpose of life is to live it
 nishedhwaad ko ek gyaan se sambandhit shaastra ke rup main sanshaywad kii charam seemaa ke taur par dekha ja saktaa he jahaan sabhi tarah ke gyaan ko nakaar diya jaataa he
 Spiritual negativism is a philosophical theory that it may not happen that everything is possible, that there is no possible world in which there is no object, or it is possible that there is at least no concrete object, so that if every possible world has a type of If there are objects, there is at least one of them which only contains objects as elements
 aadhyatmik nishedhwaad ke ek charam rup ko is vishwaas ke rup main aamtaur par paribhaashit kiya jaataa he ki astitv kaa khud hi koi vazood nahin he
 One way of interpreting this type of statement is: it is impossible to distinguish 'existence' separately from 'non-existence' because it has no properties of an object and thus is a reality that a situation affects the order between the two Can do
 yadi koi astitv ko nakaarne kaa vichaar nahin kar saktaa, to astitv kii avadharana kaa koi arth nahin he, yaa duusare shabdon main kahen to, kisi bhi sarthak tareeke se 'astitv' main nahin he
 Here 'artha' is used to argue that there is no reality at the higher level of existence which is definitely its essential and defining quality, existence itself means nothing
 Here it can be argued that if this belief is linked to the scriptures related to knowledge, then the person will only be surrounded in the circle of prohibitionism in which nothing can be real or true because such values do not exist
 yah sthiti is siddhant, ki aatma hi sachche gyaan kii vastu he, main pai ja sakati he, tathaapi, is drushtikon main atmagyaani swayan kii pushti karata he jabaki shoonyavaadee swayan kaa astitv nakaarta he
 Both these situations are forms of opposing realism
 haalanki, yah kehane ke liye ki astitv or sach maujuud nahin he, aam taur par astitv or sach ke bare main abhivyakti karnaa he
 Meirological negativism is a situation according to which no object exists with the right parts and only the basic structure without any parts) and thus the parts of which we see or experience a world full of human beings As a result of understanding

 Thomas Hibbs, a Boston College professor and philosopher, has suggested that the Sinfield TV show is an expression of prohibitionism
 tathy kaa aadhaar yah he ki yah "kuch bhi nahin" ke bare main ek "sho" he
 The majority of the episode emphasizes a little bit

 The term dada was first used in 1916 by Tristan Dzara
 ek vichaardhaara, jo lagbhag 1916 se 1922 tak rahi, pratham vishwa yuddh ke dauraan paidaa hui, ek ghatana jisane kalakaaron ko prabhavit kiya
 The Dada School of thought began in Zurich Switzerland - at the Voltaire Cafe - known as "niederdörfli" or "niederdorf"
 dadawadiyon ne daawa kiya ki dada ek kala vichaardhaara nahin thi, balki ek kala virdohi vichaardhaara thi, jisamen kabhi kabhi churaai gayi kavita kii tarah paayi gayi vasteen prayukt kii gayi hai
 The "anti-art" movement is said to have originated from the emptiness of the post-war period
 kala ke avamulyan kii is pravriti ke kaaran kai logon ne daawa kiya kii dada anivaary rup se ek shoonyavaadee andolan tha
 Given that Dada created its own meanings to explain its products, it is difficult to classify it with most other contemporary art expressions
 isliye, aspashtataa kii vajah se ise kai baar, shoonyavaadee mods vivendi ke rup main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
