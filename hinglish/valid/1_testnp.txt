 Located 30 miles southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada, the dam is named after Herbert Hoover, who first played a supporting role in the construction of this dam as a Commerce True University and later as President of the United States
 Its construction began in 1931 and was dedicated on 30 September 1935 by President Franklin D
 Roosevelt, but its construction was completed by 1936 only two years ahead of its scheduled time
 This dam and power plant are operated by the US Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation
 The Hoover Dam was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985, after being listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981

 In 1922 a commission was formed in which representatives were drawn from each of the basin states and one representative from the federal government
 Herbert Hoover became the federal representative, who at the time was president of Commerce, under President Warren Harding
 In January 1922, Hoover met with the governors of the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming to agree on an equitable arrangement to divide the waters of the Colorado River for use by all states
 The resulting Colorado River Agreement, which was signed on November 24, 1922, divided the river area into upper and lower reaches, as well as decisions on how to divide water into states that fall into each of its parts
 Was taken This agreement, named Hoover Compromise, paved the way for the Boulder Dam project

 According to preliminary plans, the dam was to be built at Boulder Canyon, hence the project was named Boulder Canyon Project
 The dam construction site was eventually moved eight miles down to Black Canyon, but the project remained the same
 The main purpose of the resettlement in Black Canyon was that a dam on the Boulder Canyon could not provide sufficient physical control to the river flowing below the dam project site — called the area of the Boulder Basin
 The Black Canyon provides a better total control of the downstream river

 During the pouring and hardening of the concrete in the construction, it was necessary to pour the refrigerated water into sections and circulate it with tubes inside the concrete
 This was done to remove the heat generated by the chemical reactions used to harden the concrete
 According to calculations, if concrete is poured at once without additional cooling, it will take 125 years to freeze and harden
 After a considerable amount of this work, Six Companies, Inc
 found that such a large refrigeration project was beyond his expertise
 Therefore, a contract was signed with Union Carbide Corporation to help meet the refrigeration requirement

 While working in the tunnels, many workers had to suffer due to carbon monoxide released from the machines there
 The contractors claimed that his illness was pneumonia and was not his responsibility
 When Nevada officials tried to enforce state mining air-quality laws, contractors took them to court
 Officially, only 96 workers died while constructing the Hoover Dam
 Some workers fell ill due to so-called "pneumonia" and died
 Most of them were not counted in the official death list
 "according to the Bureau of Reclamation's death statistics, more than one cause of pneumonia was attributed to 42 deaths during the construction period"
 In January 1936, Six Companies entered into an out-of-court settlement with fifty gas-suit prosecutors at an undisclosed price

 To divert the river flow around the construction site, four diversion tunnels were carried through the canyon walls, two toward Nevada and two toward Arizona
 This tunnel was 56 feet in diameter
 Their combined length was about 16,000 feet or more than 3 miles
 Surangan began in May 1931 in the lower portals of the Nevada tunnels
 Shortly thereafter, work was started on two similar tunnels in the Arizona Valley Wall
 In March 1932, the construction of concrete layer on the tunnel was started
 The first base, or invert, was inserted
 To transport the concrete to the site, gantry cranes running on rails spread over the entire length of each tunnel were used
 After this, the adjacent walls were put
 Moving steel structures were used for the side walls
 Eventually, overheads were filled, using pneumatic guns

 On 6 June 1933, the first concrete was laid in the dam
 As no structure of the Hoover Dam was built at that time, many of the processes used to build the dam were unharvested
 As the concrete heats up and shrinks upon freezing, uneven cooling and contraction of the concrete pose a serious problem
 Engineers from the Bureau of Reclamation calculated that if the dam was built in a casting, it would take 125 years to cool to ambient temperature
 The resulting stress could have caused the dam to crack and collapse
 To solve this problem, the dam was constructed in a series of bounded blocks of trapezoidal concrete
 Each farm had a cold coil of 1-inch thin-walled steel pipe to further cool the concrete
 The water of the river was drained from inside these pipes to help heat the heat from the hardening concrete
 Subsequently, the cooled water was pumped through coals from a refrigeration plant located in the lower cofferband to further cool the concrete
 After each layer had cooled sufficiently, the cooled coils were cut by pneumatic grout guns and filled with pressure
 John L
 Savage, the dam's design and construction supervisor, was also responsible for developing the process of cooling the concrete

 According to the initial plan, both the dam and the power plant consisted of a simple, concrete ornate wall in the refined homestead with a Gothic-inspired balustrade and a powerhouse that almost looked like an industrial warehouse
 Many people criticized its initial design for being too plain and simple for such a project to run on such a large scale, so to Gordon B
 Kaufmann, then the supervising architect of the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Reclamation in Denver and Los Angeles
 Called for the purpose of redesigning its exterior structure
 Kaufmann greatly streamlined the buildings and used an elegant artistic style throughout the project, with artistic bastions emerging uninterrupted from the mouth of the dam and clocks on the inbound towers that were scheduled for the time in Nevada and Arizona

 For True, the shapes and designs related to American Indians coincided with those of ancient Rome and Greek
 True's illustrations played a good role in Kaufmann's monumental architecture, and it must be said that together they built an American temple of modernity

" 112 deaths were associated with the construction of the dam
 There is no definite description of how many people died while working on the dam and who was the first and the last among those who died
 According to a popular legend, surveyor J
G
, the first person to die in the construction of the Hoover Dam
 Tierney was, whose death occurred due to drowning, finding the ideal location for the dam
 Coincidentally, his son, Patrick W
 Tierney, was the last person to die while working at the dam, which was 13 years after his father's death day
 Ninety-six people died during construction at the construction site
 However, another surveyor died while surveying a possible construction site before construction and these figures do not include other accidental and accidental deaths during construction

 The water flowing above the spillways quickly falls into either 600-foot-long, or 50-foot-wide spillway tunnels before rejoining construction diversion tunnels and re-enters the main riverway below the dam
 This complex spillway entrance system, coupled with an estimated 700 feet of top-to-top drop in the river from the top of the reservoir, is a difficult engineering problem and poses many design challenges
 The overall spillway capacity was empirically verified in 1941 construction tests
 This test also showed that cavitation created by high velocity flow can damage spillway tunnels when they flow to near perfect magnitude
 Further after six weeks of damage in the summer of 1983, the layers of the tunnels were repaired and the design of the spillway tunnel was changed to aim to minimize cavitation capacity

 The change in the use of the Hoover Dam and its associated water had a devastating effect on the Colorado River Delta at the mouth of the Colorado River
 The construction of the dam was marked as the beginning of the era of the collapse of the ecosystem associated with the estuary
 After the construction of the dam and the filling of the Lake Mead, for six years in the late 1930s, virtually no water flow reached the mouth of the river
 The delta estuary, formerly a mixing area of the tazepani-kharepani and stretching 65 kilometers south of the mouth of the river, was converted into an inverse estuary where the amount of salinity at the mouth of the river was actually Was high

 To provide greater highway capacity and improved safety, the new Hoover Dam bypass is scheduled to be completed by 2010 which will divert US 93 traffic 1,500 feet downstream of the dam
 The bypass will include a mixed arc bridge of steel and concrete that will be temporarily renamed the Mike o'callaghan-pat Tillman Memorial Bridge
 Once the bypass is completed, traffic moving from the Hoover Dam will be stopped

 The dam was originally planned to be built on the Boulder Canyon, but was restored to Black Canyon for better resistance, but is still renamed the Boulder Dam Project
 The Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928 did not propose to mention any name or title for the dam
 The BCPA only allows the government to "


 build, operate, and maintain dams and contingencies in the main section of the Black Canyon or Boulder Canyon on the Colorado River

 However, in 1932, Herbert Hoover lost his attempt to reelection to Franklin Delano Roosevelt
 In his memoirs, Hoover wrote that he left to observe the dam's construction progress from the night of November 12, 1932, when he was returning to Washington from his home in Pelo Alto, California, after his defeat
 He commented, "it is an extraordinary pleasure for me that the great dream i had dreamed of for a long time is taking the form of stone and cement in reality
 i have been ten years since i was chairman of the Colorado River Commission
 

 This dam, ever built by human hands, is the best kind of engineering work of its kind

 Indian religious narratives testify that the mention of the disease called 'AIDS' has been hidden in many places

 Mendelian Heritage mendelian viraasat jaivik suvidhaon kii viraasat he ki 1865 or 1866 main kanoon grager mendel johansan dwaara prastaavit ke baad or 1900 main phir se khoj shuru main yah bahut vivaadaaspad tha
 Mendel's theories have been integrated with the boveri-sutton chromosome theory of inheritance by Thomas Hunt Morgan in 1915, they are the core of classical genetics while Ronald Fisher combined them with the theory of natural selection in his 1930 book Genetical Theory of Natural Selection Gaya, putting evolution on a mathematical basis and forming the basis for population genetics and modern evolutionary synthesis
 uttaradhikaar ke niyamon grager mendel, ek unnisvin sadi main austria ke bhikshu, or baad main Prälet dwaara praapt kiye gaye, garden matar main sankaran prayogon kaa aayojan vah carch ke pichhawaade main lagaaya
 Between 1856 and 1863, he cultivated and tested some 5,000 pea plants
 in prayogon se, vah do samanyikaran jo baad main anuvanshikta yaa mendelian viraasat kaa mendel ke siddhanton ke rup main janaa jane laga prerit kiya
 He described these principles in a two-part paper, Versuche Über pflanzen-hybriden, that he read on March 8 and 8 of the Natural History Society of Brno in March 1865, and which was published in 1866
 mendel ke nishkarsh kaaphi had tak nazarandaaj kar diya gaya
 Although they were not completely unknown to the organism of the time, they were not generally seen as applicable even to Mendel himself, who thought he was just for the same species or certain categories of traits applied
 unke mahatv ko samajhane ke liye ek pramukh block mahatv santan ke samgr rup main viraasat lakshan ke spasht sammishran karne ke liye 19 veen sadi ke jeev se judi he, ab, bahujineey sambandhon ke kaaran ho janaa jaataa ang vishesh dwiadhari adhyayan paatro ke vipareet tha mendel dwaara
 In 1900, however, his work was "rediscovered" by three European scientists, Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns, and Eric von Tschermak
 "phir se khoj" kaa sahi swaroop kuch had tak bahes kii gai he: De Vries vishay par pehali baar prakashit, ek footnot main mendel kaa ullekh he, jabaki Correns De Vries 'kaagaj or saakaar vah khud bhi nahin tha ki padhane ke baad mendel kii praathamikta se baahar bataaya praathamikta
 De Vries could not accept the truth of how much of his knowledge of the law came from his work, or only after reading Mendel's newspaper
 baad main vidwaanon vastav main sabhi main parinaam nahin samaj kaa won Tschermak aarope lagaaya he
 Regardless, "rediscovered" Mendelism is an important but controversial theory
 europe main apni sabase joardaar pramotor wiliam Bateson, jo shabd "anuvanshiki" or "elil" gadha apane siddhanton main se kai kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya gaya tha
 The model of heredity was highly contested by another organism because it is implied that heredity was apparently discontinuous, observable for many traits, in opposition
 kai jeev bhi siddhant ko khaarij kar diya kyonki unhen yakeen he ki yah sabhi prajatiyon ke liye lagu hoga nahin the
 However, later work by biologists and statisticians such as Ronald Fischer has shown that if many factors were involved in the expression of an individual trait Mendelian, they could produce the observed diverse results, and thus know Has shown that Mendelian genetics is compatible with natural selection
 thomas hunt morgan or apane sahaayakon baad main uttaradhikaar ke gunasutra siddhant he, jo koshikaon ke gunasutron vaastavik vanshanugat saamagree pakad laga rahe the saath mendel ke saidhantik model ekikrut, or banaaya kya ab, shastreey anuvanshiki ke rup main janaa jaataa he jo behad safal rahaa tha or itihaas main mendel kii jagah pukhta
 Mendel's findings allow scientists such as Fisher and JBS to estimate the expression of traits based on Haldane's mathematical possibilities
 mendel kii safalataa ke liye ek bada yogadan unke nirnay keval paudhon vah pradarshan sach prajnan the ke saath uske paar shuru karne ke liye pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 They also measured only absolute features, such as color, shape, and lineage status, rather than quantitative characteristics
 unhone apane parinaamon sankhyanusaar vyakt kii or unhen sankhyikeey vishleshan ke adheen he
 Their method of data analysis and their large sample size gave credibility to their data
 unhone yah bhi doordarshita matar ke paudhon kii kai peedi dar peedi kaa paalan karen or unke parivartanon ko darj karne ke liye kiya tha
 Finally, he performed "cross-test" appearance and reveal the proportion of the characters in the retreat
 pehle kanoon: algaav kaa kanoon
 Second law: the law of independent classification
 tisare kanoon: prabhutv kaa kanoon The law of segregation states that every individual organism has two alleles for each trait, and that such alleles are such that each gamete separated during meiosis contains only one of the alleles
 ek vansh is tarah ek ke liye alleles kii ek jodi praapt karata he mata-pita jeevon se mutabiq gunasutron viraasat main mili dwaara visheshta:
 One allele for each trait from each parent
 is siddhant ke anvik saboot baad main do vaigyanikon ko swatantra rup se, german vanaspatishastri 1876 main auskar Hertwig, or belgium ke jeev vigyaani 1883 paitruk or matra gunasutron main aduard vaan benneden ardhasutrivibhaajan main alag ho or ke lakshan ke saath alleles dwaara ardhasutrivibhaajan ke avlokan ke madhyam se mila tha ek charitra do alag yugmak main alag kar rahe hai
 Each parent contributes a single gametes, and thus a single, randomly successful allele copies their lineage and fertilization
 swatantra vargeekaran kaa kanoon kahata he ki alag lakshan ke liye alleles santanon ke mata-pita se ek duusare kii swatantra rup se paarit kar rahe hai
 That is, the biological selection of one allele for one trait has nothing to do with the selection of one allele for another trait
 mendel ne apane dihybrid paar prayogon main is kanoon ke liye samarthan mila
 monohybrid cross, ideal 3: occurred in a ratio of 1 between dominant and recessive phenotypes
 3: 3: 1 ke anupaat main dihybrid paar main, haalanki, vah ek 9 paaya
 This suggests that each of the two alleles is inherited independently of the other, with a 3: 1 phenotypic ratio for each
 swatantra vargeekaran meiotic profez main dauraan eukeriotic jeevon main hota he, or jeev ke gunasutron kaa ek mishran ke saath ek yugmak paidaa karata he
 The physical basis of independent classification of chromosomes is the random orientation of each bivalent chromosome along the metaphase plate in relation to other divalent chromosomes
 paar ke saath-saath swatantra vargeekaran upanyaas anuvanshik sangyojan kaa nirmaan karke anuvanshik vividhta bad jaati he
 Mendel's law of dominance states that recessive alleles will always be masked by dominant alleles
 isliye, ek homozygous pramukh or ek samayugmak aprabhavi ke bich ek cross hameshaa pramukh phenotype vyakt karenge, jabaki abhi bhi ek vishamyugmaji ginotip kar rahi he
 The law of dominance can be easily explained with the help of a mono hybrid cross experiment: - For any pair in a cross between pure two organisms contrasting traits, the character that appears in the F1 generation is called "dominant" and One that is suppressed is called "retreat
 " prayek charitra bhinn karkon main se ek jodi ke dwaara niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 Only expresses one of the characters
 ek he jo F1 peedi main vyakt pramukh kaha jaataa he
 But let him also note, that the law of dominance is important and right, but not universally applicable is important
 naveenatam sanshodhan ke anusaar, in niyamon ke keval do kanoonon ko mana jaataa he
 The third one is not considered a fundamental principle but as a genetic law of Mendel
 ek mendelian visheshta he ki ek ek bhaag ke pattern main ek bhi thikaana dwaara niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 In such cases, mutation in a single gene can cause a disease that is inherited according to Mendel's laws
 udhaaharan sical cell anemia, tay sex rog, sistic fibrosis or Xeroderma pigmentosa shaamil hai
 a disease is a multi-factorial disease controlled by a gene, like arthritis, which is affected by multiple loci as well as contrasts with those diseases inherited in a non-mendelian fashion
 baravi kaksha kaa pathyapustak
 Karluq or Qarluq was a nomadic Turkish tribe that settled in the region of kara-irtish and Tarbat e mountains in the west from the Altai Mountains in Central Asia
 inhen chini log gelolu bhi bulaate the
 The Karluk community belonged to the Uygur people in terms of ethnicity
 turki bhashaaon main ek karlook shakha he, jiskaa naam inhi karlukon par padaa or jisamen uigur bhashaa, uzbek bhashaa or ili turki bhashaa shaamil hai
 There is a debate among scholars on how the Karluk clan got its name and there are many assumptions
 inamen se kuch is prakaar hai - Karluk used to be under Goekturk Khaganat
 san 742 i main ve uigur or basamil qabeelon ke saath milakar goekaturk kagaanath ke viruddh baghaavat main uthe
 In 744 the Basmils captured the Goetkurk capital Otugen and King Ozmish Khan
 lekin usee saal uiguron or karluqon ne aapasi santhganth kar lee or milakar basamilon par hamalaa kar diya
 The head of the king of the Basmills was annihilated and the entire tribes were either enslaved or distributed to other tribes or sold to the Chinese
 uigur sardaar ab is nai kagaanath kaa kagaan bana or karluq uske adheen rajyapal bana
 Within a year, skirmishes between the Uygurs and the Qarluk started and the Qarluk were forced to leave their lands and move to the west
 karlukon ke pashchim jane se unhone turki bhashaaon ko madhya asia ke adhik vistrut hisson main failaayaa
 In 751 AD, the Muslim Arab army collided with the Tang dynasty of China in Central Asia
 pehle to karlukon ne chiniyon kaa saath diya lekin phir dal badalakar arabon ke saath ho gaye jis se chiniyon kii haar hui or madhya asia kaa ek bada bhu-bhaag chini prabhaav se bahaar ho gaya
 The Karluk kingdom was established in eastern Kazakhstan in 766, which bordered the Uygur Khaganat in the east

 It received the permission of the Governor General on 25 February 1856, but this law was passed in 1857 under Act no
 9 was rejected because it did not obtain the approval of the Queen of England before it was made
 naye avishkaar ke utpaadakon ko protsaahit karne ke liye 1859 main, adhinium san

 ‘avishkaar’ kaa arth us prakriya yaa utpaada se he, jo ki audyogic upyojan ke yogya he
 Invention should be new and useful and it should be the next step in the knowledge of the technology of that time
 yah avishkaar us kala main kushal vyakti ke liye spasht bhi nahin hona chaiye
 The invention should also be viewed in light of Section 3 of the Patent Act of India

 It is named after Alois Alzheimer's, who first described it

 They take supplies, produce energy, build organs and exclude waste
 koshikaayen soochnaaon ko jamaa karti hai or phir unka prasanskaran bhi karti hai
 The body needs a large amount of oxygen and fuel in coordination with it to keep going
 alzimer rog main koshikaon kii udyog kaa hissaa kaam karnaa band kar detaa he, jisase duusare kaamon par bhi asar padataa he
 As the damage increases, the working power in the cells decreases and eventually they die
 yadi aap khud main yaa apane kisi parijan main inamen se koi chetavanee sanket dekhen, tatkaal kisi chikitsak se sampark karen
 Timely identification and treatment, support and support of Alzheimer's or other dementia-causing disorders is very important
 snaayu koshikaon ko nuksaan pahunchaane or maarane ke liye do sandigdh tatwon patia / falak or lat kii pahchaan hui he
 Plaques form in the middle of the nervous system and tangles are found in the dying cells as fibers
 haalaanki adhikansh logon main umr badhane ke saath plake or tengal paidaa hone lagate hai, alzimer ke rogi main inaki sankhya bahut adhik hoti he
 Plaques and tangles are formed more in areas from which the ability to learn or remember is created and later spread to other areas

 can improve the life of Alzheimer's patients

 Agnosticism is different from skepticism; According to skepticism or skepticism, no definite knowledge of any substance of the world is possible

 Their style develops as boxers apply what they learn during their practice and whatever is appropriate for themselves
 phir bhi, aisi anek shabdaawaliyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jo mote taur par ek mukkebaaz kii style kaa varnan karti hai
 Note that to describe a boxer it is not necessary to be limited to one of these terminology
 a player can complete in both internal fighting and external fighting, a good example of which are Manny Pacquiao and Bernard Hopkins, and may also have a unique style of boxers that cannot be easily incorporated into any category, such as Naseem Hamid
 ek paaramparik "mukkebaaz" yaa shailikar tezi se, lambii duuri ke mukke maarthe hue, sarvaadhik ullekhneey rup se chubhaate hue or antat apane pratidwandvi ko neeche gira kar apane or pratidwandvi ke bich antar banaae rakhane kaa prayaas karata he
 Because of this dependence on weak punches, the out-fighter tends to win by the decision of points rather than knock-outs, although some out-fighters have notable knock-out records
 aksar unhen mukkebaazi ke sarvshereshth ranneetikaar bhi mana jaataa he kyonki unamem ladaai kii gati ko niyantrit kar paane or apane pratidwandvi kaa netritv karne kii kshamta hoti he, jiske dwaara ve yojanabaddh rup se use parajeet kar dete hai or kisi brollar kii tulana main adhik kushalta or yogyata kaa parichay dete hai

 a brawler is a player who lacks aptitude and foot movement in the ring, but who accomplishes this by his proficiency in boxing
 anek brollar gatishiltaa ko kam rakhane kaa prayaas karte hai, kam gatisheel rahane ko praathamikta dete hai, adhik sthir dharaatal chaahate hai or apane pairon ko tej gati se chalaane vaale khilaadiyon kaa muqabla kar paane main unhen kathinaayee mahasoos hoti he
 They may also have a tendency to ignore combination boxing and instead continue with one-handed boxing and lower-speed and more powerful boxing

 antahyoddha / swormar apane pratidwandvi ke nikat bane rahane kaa prayaas karata he or achaanak teevr akraman karte hue or hook tathaa apper-cat ke sangyojan kaa prayog karata he
 a successful injection often requires a good "chin" because in swarming one often encounters multiple jabs before getting close to their opponent, where they are more effective

 However, there are some players who, despite being longer than their category, have adapted well to both inter-war and external war
 ek swormar kaa mul-mantra bina ruke hamalaa karte rahanaa he
 Many short-tempered legends take advantage of their stature and use the bob-and-weave defense to defend themselves by keeping their waist slightly bent, moving them down or next to the punches
 avrodh ke vipareet, yadi pratidwandvi ke mukka vyarth chalaa jaae, to isse uskaa taal-mail bighad jaataa he, jisase khilaadi ko aage badhkar pratidwandvi mukkebaaz kii tani hui baanh kii seemaa ke bheetar pahunch jane kaa mauka mil jaataa he or javaabi hamalaa karne ke liye uske haath khule hue hote hai
 One of the distinct advantages that the intuition receives when hitting uppercuts is that they can load their entire body with a punch; Mike Tyson was famous for destroyer uppercut
 kuch antahyoddha apane kathor waar ke liye kukhyat rahe hai
 Aggression, patience, tolerance and bobbing-and-weaving are the most important for a swarmer
 ullekhneey antahyoddhaon main mike tison, harry greb, jaik dempsy, rocky marciano, jo frezier, jack lamota or julio seizar shauez shaamil hai
 Respondent boxers are indecisive, defensive-style players who often rely on their opponent's mistakes to gain an advantage, whether it is on the score card or more preferably a knock-out
 ve hamalon se bachane ke liye apni purna viksit pratiraksha kaa prayog karte hai or phir sahi samay par ek sateek mukka maar kar apane pratidwandvi ko turant parrast kar dete hai
 Thus, fighting against a responding boxer requires constant deception and never letting his box be guessed, so that the responding boxer cannot make a good attack

 Notable respondent boxers include Floyd Mayweather, Jr

 In general, an intra-warrior gains more than an extraterrestrial, an extraterrestrial gains more than a puncture, and a puncture gains more than an intransigent; Thus each style is stronger than one genre and weaker than the other, creating a cycle of sorts and no one dominates the other like the rock-paper-scissors game
 Naturally, many other factors, such as the level of skill and the training of players, determine the outcome of the bout, but this belief is widely accepted in the minds of boxers and writers regarding the relationship between genres
 Is that "style wins the battle
" brollar swormaron yaa antahyoddhaon par haaavee hone kaa prayaas karte hai kyonki slogar ke nikat aane kaa prayaas karne par, antah yoddha ko nirapavaad rup se bahut adhik kathortapurvak akraman kar rahe brollar kii bandook kaa saamana karnaa padegaa, atah, jab tak antahyoddha main bahut adhik sahansheeltaa na ho or brollar kii shakti bahut kamazor na ho, tab tak brollar kii majboot shakti hi vijayi hogi
 jo frezier ke khilaaf jorge forman kii nock-out jeet is prakaar ke milan ke laabh kaa ek prasiddh udhaaharan he
 Although internal warriors struggle against heavy sluggers, they typically enjoy greater success against out-fighters or boxers
 bahya-yoddha ek dhimi ladaai pasand karte hai, jisamen unke or pratidwandvi ke bich kuch antar ho
 Intemperance attempts to bridge this gap and to uncover furious attacks
 bhitari bhaag main, bahya-yoddha apni ladane kii prabhavakaarita kaa bahut sara bhaag kho detaa he kyonki vah kathor mukke maar paane main sakasham nahin hota
 saamanytah is sthiti main antahyoddha safal rahata he kyonki apane pratidwandvi par laabh kii tivrata or acchhee dakshata ke kaaran use haraa paanaa kathin ho jaataa he
 For example, the swarmer who was easily defeated by slugger George Foreman was able to create many other problems for him in his three encounters with Frazier boxer Muhammad Ali
 sanyas ke baad jo louis ne yah sweekaar kiya ki unhen ghir jane se nafrat thi or mukt / aparajit vijeta rocky marciano jaise swormar louis ke sarvshereshth daur main bhi unke liye style kii samasya utpann kar paane main sakasham hue hote
 Boxers or out-fighters are the most successful, unlike a brawler whose slow pace and weak technique make him a simple target of a fast out-fighter attack
 bahya-yoddha kii mukhya chintaa sajag bane rahanaa hoti he kyonki brollar ko apana khel puraa karne ke liye keval ek acha mukka maarane kii zarurat hoti he
 If the extraterrestrial could survive those powerful blows, he could often defeat Brawler by his sharp punches
 yadi vah paryaapt rup se safal ho, to baad ke chakron main atirikt dabaav daalkar vah ek nock-out hasil karne kaa prayaas bhi kar saktaa he
 Most traditional boxers, such as Muhammad Ali, enjoyed their best successes against sluggers

 During the fight, Taylor's early motion with his hands and feet and his boxing abilities gave him an early advantage, which led to a huge lead in points, but in the end Chavez's punishment defeated Taylor and the final leg
 a gruesome punch punched by the right hand knocked him down, leading to his defeat
 chunki mukkebaazi main shakti ke saath lagaataar mukke maarna shaamil hota he, atah haathon kii haddiyon main hone vaali kshati se bachaav ke liye saavdhaaniyaan baratna anivaary he
 Most trainers do not allow boxers to train and practice without wearing hand / wrist coverings and boxing gloves
 Hand coverings are used to protect the bones of the hands, and gloves are used to protect the hands from any fatal injury, giving boxers a chance to punch with more force than that, They would have been killed without using them
 Gloves have been essential to competition since the late nineteenth century, although modern boxing gloves are much heavier than gloves worn by early twentieth-century players

 The brand of gloves can also affect the impact of punches, so it is often agreed before a match
 daaton va masoodon ko chot se bachaane ke liye or thodhi kaa bachaav karne ke liye ek mukh-rakshak bhi aavashyak hota he, jisase nock-out kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he
 Boxers practice their skills on two basic types of punching bags
 pratikriyaaon or doharaavpurn dhang se mukke maarane ke kaushal ko painaa karne ke liye ek choti, aansu kii boond ke aakaar kii "speed bag" kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jabaki shaktishaalee dhang se mukke maarane or sharir par hone vaale bheeshan praharon kaa abhyaas karne ke liye ek badi belanaakaar "haivi bag" kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jo ret, ek sanshleshit padaarth athwa jal se bhari hui hoti he
 In addition to these specialized materials of equipment, boxers also use more common training equipment to increase their strength, speed and patience
