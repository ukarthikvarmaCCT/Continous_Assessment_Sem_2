 Before and after the British left India in 1947, there was tremendous pressure on the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir to merge into one of the newly created two nations
 bharat ke batwaare par hue samjhaute ke dastavej ke anusaar riyasto ke raajaaon ko dono main se ek raashtra ko chunane kaa adhikaar tha parantu kashmir ke maharaja hari sih apni riyasat ko swatantra rakhana chaahate the or unhone kisi bhi raashtra se judane se bachanaa chaha
 After the British left India, the princely state was attacked by Pakistani soldiers and Pashtuno tribal fighters
 is bhay se ki riyasat kii fuj inkaa saamana nahin kar paayegi maharaja ne bharat se sainik sahaayta maangi
 India laid the condition for Kashmir's accession to India in lieu of military aid
 maharaja ke hami bharne par bharat ne is vilay ko manyata de di or riyasat ko jammu kashmir ke naam se nayaa rajya bana diya
 Indian Army contingents were immediately deployed to protect the state
 kintu is vilay kii vaidhata par pakistan asahmat tha
 Since caste-based figures were not available, it was difficult to determine the reasons behind Maharaj's accession to India
 pakistan kii yah daleel thi ki maharaja ko bhartiya sena bulaane kaa adhikaar nahin tha kyonki angrejo ke aane ke pehle kashmir ke maharaja kaa koi pad nahin tha or yah pad keval angrejo kii niyukti thi
 So Pakistan decided to go to war but its army chief Douglas Gracie refused to accept the Pakistani Prime Minister's order to this effect
 unka tark yah tha ki kashmir par kabja kar rahi bhartiya senaayen british rajasatta kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahi hai atah vah usase yuddh nahin kar sakate
 However, Pakistan later sent forces, but by then India had occupied almost two Tihai Kashmir
 yah yuddh purv jammu or kashmir riyasat kii simaaon ke bheetar bhartiya sena ardhsainik bal or purv jammu or kashmir riyasat kii senaaon or pakistani sena ardhsainik bal or pakistan ke uttar pashchim seemaant rajya ke kabeelai ladaako jo khud ko aaazaad kashmir kii sena ke naam se pukaarte the ke bich ladaa gaya tha
 Initially, the army of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir was not ready for the initial attacks of the tribal fighters of Azad Kashmir, it was deployed only in small numbers to guard the border, so their defense system collapsed immediately in front of the attack and some of their The troops met the enemies
 aaazaad kashmir ke kabeelai ladaake shuruwati aasaan safaltaaon ke baad lutpaat main vyast hry gayi or unhone aage bad aasaani se kabje main aa sakane vaale naye ilaako par hamalaa karne main der kar di or maharaja kae bharat main vilay main sahamati dete hi bhartiya sena ko vimaano kii madad se sainik pahuchane kaa mauka de diya
 By the end of 1947, the Pakistani campaign to capture Kashmir had evaporated
 keval himalay ke upari hisso main aaazaad kashmir naam kii pakistani sena ko kuch safaltaayen mili par aakhir main unhe leh ke bahari hisse se june unniis sau adtalis main waapas khaded diya gaya
 Throughout 1948, there were many minor battles between the two sides, but no one got any significant strategic success and gradually a border which is now known as the Line of Control was established
 31 disambar 1948 main aupchaarik yuddh viraam kii ghoshnaa ho gayi
 This war can be divided into ten parts
 yah bhaag is prakaar se hai
 The main objective of the initial attack was to take control of the Kashmir Valley and its major city Srinagar
 jammu or kashmir riyasat kii greeshmakaleen rajdhani srinagar or sheetakaaleen rajdhani jammu thi
 The princely forces stationed at Muzaffarabad and Domel were immediately defeated by a Pakistani army called Azad Kashmir Army and the road to Srinagar was opened
 riyasat kii sena ke punah sangathit hone ke pehle srinagar par kabja karne ke bajaay aaazaad kashmir sena seemaant shahro par kabja karne or uske nivaasiyon se lutpaat evam anya atyaachaar karne main jute gayi
 In Poonch valley, the princely armies retreated and concentrated in the cities, and after several months they were freed from captive Indian Army encirclement
 jammu or kashmir riyasat ke bharat se vilay ke baad bharat ne vimaan ke dwaara sainik or upkaran srinagar pahunchaaye
 Upon reaching there, he strengthened the princely army and built a security cordon around Srinagar and defeated the Azad Kashmir Army
 is suraksha ghere main bhartiya sena ke bakhtarband vahno ke dwaara virodhiyo ko peeche se gherna bhi shaamil tha
 After defeating the retreating Pakistani army till Baramulla and Uri, both these cities were liberated, although the encirclement of the cities continued by the Pakistani army in the Poonch Valley
 gilgit main aaazaad kashmir kii kabeelai sena main gilgit rajya ke ardh sainik bal shaamil ho gayi or chitral ke mehtar jagirdaar kii sena bhi apane jagirdaar ke pakistan main vilay kii ghoshnaa ke baad usame shaamil ho gayi The Indian Army ceased to chase Azad Kashmir's army after the capture of Uri and Baramulla and sent an aid force in an attempt to break the encirclement of Poonch in the south direction

 a second support unit reached Kotli but had to retreat leaving the barricade of Apna Kotli, in the meantime, Mirpur was captured by the army of Azad Kashmir

 Other contingents of Pakistan / Azad Kashmir army continued unsuccessful attacks on Uri
 duusari ore bharat ne ek chote se akraman se chhmb par kabja bana liya
 By this time, additional military forces were available with the Indian Army, in which situation on the Line of Control began to stabilize
 bhartiya sena balon ne jhanger or rajori par pratiakraman kar ke unhe kabje main le liya
 The Azad Kashmir Army in the Kashmir Valley continued to attack the security apparatus of Uri

 Despite numerous counter-offensives by the army of Azad Kashmir, the Indians kept control of Jhanger, although now the army of Azad Kashmir was getting more and more help from regular Pakistani soldiers

 The army of Azad Kashmir was getting a good boost in the high Himalayan regions
 unhone tukadiyo kii ghuspaith kar ke kargil par gheraabandi kar di tathaa scardu kii madad ke liye ja rahe bhartiya sainya daston ko haraa diya
 The Indian Army Ballo continued the attack in the Kashmir valley and proceeded northward and captured Keran and Gurais
 unhone tidhwal par kiye gayi ek pratiakarman ko waapas khaded diya
 The Indian contingent at Poonch in the Poonch Valley broke the siege and joined it briefly for the outside world
 lambey samay se fasee kashmir riyasat kii tukdi gilgit scout se scardu kii raksha karne main ab tak safal thi is liye pakistani sena leh kii ore nahin batch paa rahi thi
 In August, Chitral's army attacked Skardu under the leadership of mata-ul-mulk and captured Skardu with the help of artillery
 isse gilgit scout ladakh kii ore aage jane kaa mauka mil gaya
 During this time the Line of Control was being established and the defense of the areas under its control on both sides was more important than attacking
 is dauraan keval ek mahatvapurn abhiyaan chalaaya gaya yah tha abhiyaan dak jo ki bhartiya balo dwaara draas ke kabje ke liye tha is dauraan poonch par gheraabandi jari rahi
 Now the Indian Army was heavily dependent on the Pakistani Army and its supported Azad Kashmir Army on all fields
 poonch ko ek saal lambii gheraabandi se aaazaad kara liya gaya tha or gilgit scout jo ki ab tak acchhee kamyaabi hasil kar rahi thi use use aakhirkaar haraakar uskaa peechha karte hue bhartiya sena ne kargil ko aaazaad kara liya par aage hamalaa karne ke liye bhartiya sena ko rasad kii aapurti kii samasya aa sakati thi atah unhe ruknaa padaa jojila darre ko tanks kii madad se kabje main le liya gaya pakistani sena tanks kii apeksha nahin kar rahi thi or unke turant paanv ukhd gayi
 The use of the tank was possible only due to the experience gained from the Burma War
 is darre par kabje ke baad draas par aasaani se kabja ho gaya
 On reaching this phase of the fight, the Indian Prime Minister made up his mind to take the matter to the United Nations General Assembly and get the matter resolved by him
 31 disambar 1948 ko sanyukt raashtra ke dwaara yuddh viraam kii ghoshnaa kii gai
 a few days before the ceasefire, the Pakistani army broke the road contact between the two by conducting a counter-offensive and seizing the route between Uri and Poonch
 ek lambey molbhav ke baad dono paksh yudhviram par raji ho gayi
 The terms of this ceasefire were adopted by the United Nations on August 13, 1948

 These stages were yah ghatnaayen yah bataati hai ki asambhavit jagaho par bakhtarband vahno ke hamale kaa dushman par maansik dabaav padataa he
 It may also happen that the attackers did not use anti-tactic weapons, perhaps they did not leave them behind
 bakhtarband vahno ke prayog kii safalataa ne bharat kii yuddh niti par gahari chhap chodi china ke saath yuddh ke vakt bharatiyo ne badi mehnat se durgam ilaako main bakhtarband vahno kaa prayog kiya kintu us yuddh main bakhtar band vahno ko apekshit safalataa nahin mili
 If we study the changes in the boundary line, then some interesting facts emerge

 In 1948, Pakistan invaded Kashmir and captured a third of it
 abhi tak yah ek tihaai bhaag pakistan ke paas he
 The armies of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir were dispersed at the beginning of this war and only a small number were deployed to deal with terrorist attacks

 This meant that the British were squeezing the Indian economy by constantly imposing exports to their advantage and charging unnecessary surcharges

 From 1897 to 1904, he was Professor of Indian History at the University of London
 unka nidhan 1909 main hua
 Through his deep research and analysis, Dutt showed that the British rule not only failed to improve the physical condition of India, but also during its period India was de-industrialized
 british aarthik niti ke parinamswaroop bharat ke dastakaari utpaadan main jabardast giravat aayi or uski bharpai ke rup main audyogic utpaadan main badhotaree nahin hui
 Nor was Indian industry given any kind of protection
 nattejey ke taur par bhartiya arthvyavastha pehle se kahin zyaada kheti par nirbhar hone ke liye majaboor ho gayi
 Indian society continued to become rustic

 Due to rail transport started by the British, traditional transport services were killed and trains were used to carry goods made in British factories
 dutt kaa nishkarsh tha ki bhartiya arthvyavastha aviksit nahin he, balki uskaa vikaas avaruddh kar diya gaya he
 The history written by him defies the Marxist notion prevalent in a section of scholars according to which the role of British colonialism is seen to be progressive
 aarthik itihaaskaar ke alaava ramesh chandra dutt ek pratibhashali or kushal saanskrithik itihaaskaar bhi the
 Along with being the founder president of Bangi Sahitya Parishad, he also briefly wrote Mahabharata and Ramayana in English
 sanskrit sahitya ke pramaanon ke aadhaar par dutt ne bharat kii pracheen sabhyataa ke itihaas kii rachana bhi kii
 Apart from highlighting the ill effects of British economic policy, Dutt's second major contribution to the development of economic ideas was that he advocated setting limits to government intervention in the economy
 yah sifaarish unhone beesvin sadi kii shuruyaat main ek aise samay main kii jab anya bhartiya arthshaastri aarthik jivan main sarkaar ke hastkshep ko kam karne kii maang kar rahe the
 Dutt said that the government should avoid private initiative interventions but should be prepared to intervene under specific circumstances so as to avoid conflict of interest by avoiding temporary types of crises
 yatharth kaa akalan karne kii dutt kii paddati bhi us jamaane ke hisaab se alag tarah kii thi
 Dutt developed the concept of interdependence of economic and political facts, instead of considering one as the major and the other as his influence among the many reasons of reality
 unki manyata thi ki samaaj ke tantra main har chiz ek-duusare par nirbhar he, paraspar judi hui he isliye santulan bigaadane jaisaa koi bhi kaam nahin karnaa chahie
 However, Dutt also understood that balance is not always the same
 vah lagaataar badalata rahata he
 Therefore, the government should focus on the underlying dynamics of the immediate situation while intervening, or else its interventionist actions may result in the opposite
 arthshaastra par dutt kii rachanaaon kaa prakaashan 1900 se shuru hua
 His first book was 'famines and Land Assessment in India', which studied the famines in India, which was also praised by Russian anarchist philosopher Prince Kropatkin
 unki is kriti se zaahir tha ki ve bhartiya kisaan kii jivan-sthitiyon main kitni dilchaspee rakhte hai or unka aarthik chintan kis tarah se uski sthiti sudhaarney par kendrit he
 Dutt questioned why the people of India had to face ten horrific famines in the span of forty years since 1858? He asked that during this time the ruler was in the hands of the Empress rather than the East India Company
 is dauraan aamtaur par shanti rahi or keval ek hi yuddh hua
 The government had trained administrators who had sufficient experience in Indian conditions
 zamin upjau thi, kisaan udhyami or kifaayatshar the
 Despite such favorable circumstances, why did it happen that during these famines, about 1
5 crore people lost their lives due to hunger? Dutt did not agree to believe that the cause of famines is due to the rapid increase in population or that the farmers of India are careless, Kahil and foolish
 unhone yah bhi sweekaar nahin kiya ki kisaanon kaa soodakhor mahajanon ke shikanje main fasaa hona akaal kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Dutt showed in his study that the growth rate of population in India was not only always lower than in England, but in the ten years before his study, the population of this country had stopped increasing
 dutt ke anusaar bharat se zyaada parishramee or kam karch main guzar-basar karne vaale kisaan duniya main or kahin nahin hai
 He cited the reports of commissions investigating the causes of famine and said that it is due to the rigorous recovery of government revenue that farmers have to depend on the Mahajans
 angrez sarkaar ko aainaa dikhaate hue dutt ne pradarshit kiya ki akaal ke baavjood aisa koi saal nahin tha jab sari fasalen chaupat ho gayi hon
 Grain was always full in government warehouses
 ek praant main agar fasal karaab ho gayi ho, to duusare praant main fasal acchhee hui
 Farming has expanded, it has become denser, yields have also increased compared to earlier, prices of agricultural produce have also increased, but even after this the condition of farmers has continued to deteriorate
 iske liye dutt ne british nitiyon ko zimmedaar tehraaya
 In 1902, the first volume of Dutt's great treatise 'the Economic History of British India' was published
 ise british hukumat par likhe gayi sabase behtareen granth kii sangya di jaati he
 In it, economic history was introduced from the establishment of British power in 1757 till the emperor's rule was implemented
 isamen east india company ke tahat apanaayi gayi kheti or bhoomi bandobast sambandhi nitiyon, vyapaar or kaarkaanaa utpaadan sambandhi nitiyon ke saath-saath vitt or prashasan sambandhi nitiyon kaa vishleshnatmak vivaran tha
 British reviewers of the book also considered its impartiality and depth iron
 1904 main is mahagranth kaa doosraa khand prakashit hua
 He claimed on the basis of authentic facts that selfish policies adopted in the early years of British rule have been responsible for the decline of Indian industries
 dutt ne bharat main garibi ke kaarnon par prakaash daalate hue sabit kiya ki angrezon kii niti ke kaaran deshi udyog or hastkalaon ko tabah ho janaa padaa
 Millions of people became unemployed, leaving no other option but to live for them
 is tarah kheti ke bharose jivit rahane waalon kii sankhya had se zyaada bad gayi or sabhi ke rahan-sahan kaa str gir gaya
 Along with this, the British continued to spend huge money to rule India, which did not benefit the country
 rajkoshiya niti or bhu-rajasav pranali kuch is tarah kii banaayi gayi ki kisaan ke paas sirf zindaa bache rahane laayak sansaadhan hi rah gayi
 Dutt also had a prescription for curing these problems
 unhone sifaarish kii ki bhartiya mil udyog se utpaadan shulk hataa liya jaae, nichi daron ke naram lagaan ke alaava baaki sabhi taxon se kisaanon ko chhutkaaraa diya jaae, england main hone vaali faujee or shahi karch bharat se nahin vasule jane chahie or bharat main bhi faujee karch ghataaye jane chahie
 As soon as Dutt made these suggestions, the British government and its supporters started criticizing them all-round
 unke tathyon or vishleshan ko kaarij karne kii koshish kii gayi
 It should be noted that Dutt was a senior officer of Indian Civil Services and was bound by the responsibility of serving British rule
 lekin, apni baat par jame rah kar unhone apane virodhiyon ke saath bahes kii or sarkaar se lagaataar anurodh kiya ki vah bharat kii aarthik dasha main sudhaar ke liye nitiyaan badale
 His unique talent was not limited only to administrative work, but he was also an original writer and historian

 The European influence is reflected in many bakeries selling cakes, cream horns and Western-style yeast leavened bread and in anglo-indian cuisine
 The importation of potatoes, tomatoes, and chilli peppers from the Americas led to their enthusiastic use in Kerala, although for chillies everywhere except, other ingredients are used sparingly
 kerala bhojan main masaale As with almost all Indian food, spices play an important role in Kerala cuisine
 mukhya masaale kaa istemaal kiya dalacheenee, ilaychi, adarak, hari or laal mirch, laung, lahasun, jira, dhaniya, haldi or itnaa par hai

 Due to the limited influence of Central Asian food on Kerala, the use of sweets is not as widespread as in North India

 aam taur par, payasam ke liye chhodkar, adhikansh mithai khaane ke baad mithai ke rup main, lekin ek chaay ke samay naashte ke rup main nahin kha rahe hai

 was very commonly drunk, although it has been replaced to some extent by soda pop

 khaanaa pakaane ke bartan vahaan bartan ki kerala jo kerala main bhojan ke liye mahatvapurn hai main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 China Chatti, an aduppu a square hearth, is a deep frying pan cooking a pot made of Mun Chatti clay
 anushthan main khaadya prasad Food is extremely important when it comes to rituals or festivals
 anushthan main khaadya prasad kerala main or puure dakshin bharat mahatvapurn hai
 The food offerings are often related to the deities of the religion
 bharat main, vahaan hindu devataaon ke liye kai prastaav hai or vahaan uttar or dakshin bharat main khaanaa prasad ke bich kai matbhed hai
 Most offerings are more than one type of food
 vahaan kai kaaran logon ko bhojan prasad kaa abhyaas kaa upyog kar rahe hai
 To express something is to express love, or to converse or thank the gods
 yah bhi 'hindu dharm ke kuch dhanchaagat suvidhaon tanaav "kiya ja saktaa he
 Of course, not every ritual requires deity food offerings
 sabase kuch khaadya padaarthon ke liye ek pasand he
 For example, butter is one of the foods preferred by Lord Krishna
 iske alaava, junglee naarangi or ek ganna danthal ganpati ke liye jude hue hai
 There is a category of Hindu pantheon in pure and impure which emphasizes the gods, but shaped by food offerings
 shuddh shaakaahaari bhojan devataaon kii peshkash kar rahe hai jabaki ashuddh devataaon maance ke kaaran rakt ke liye apni laalasaa ko diya jaataa he ek vishisht pakwaan donon shuddh or ashuddh devataaon ko peshkash kii he
 
 It is a flour lamp made of sweet rice flour paste which is caught outside and packed with ghee
 aataa deepak keval aanshik rup se pake hue or phir khaaya
 bhojan prasad kaa ek anya pahalu padanukram he ki khaadya padaarthon kii he jaataa he
 It may seem strange that there is a hierarchy for foods, but this is because there is a dual opposition between pure and impure gods which is the hierarchal of the two gods who have this dual opposition
 
 ve vishnu or shiv hai
 Loh's Luzzi explains that while Vishnu is seen as 'the offerings that are given to Shiva are more frugal'
 shiv ke liye ek bhent karne ke liye koi namak yaa anya toppings ke saath sade chaaval hone kii sambhaavna he, jabaki vishnu ko ek bhent ke ek dakshin bhartiya pakwaan jo anya said dish ke saath chaaval se milakar kar sakate hai jaise lagate ho saktaa he
 Especially in South Indian offerings, they are offered in numbers
 udhaaharan ke liye, teen number kerala prasad main mahatvapurn he
 There are trimadhura in 'three sweets'
 All of these practices of food offerings in the ritual which translate are important in Kerala culture as well as in South Indian culture

 Despite the lack of facilities, considerable difficulty is involved in the transportation of cooking equipment and materials and the bright February sun, the number of participants seems to grow year after year and include some of the famous faces from cinema, even in socially ordinary circles
 
 It is also observed that the practice of pongala is rapidly spreading in Trivandrum city and many other temples in the district

malaria-prone areas, every patient with fever is given a presumptive diagnosis of malaria and treatment is started with quinine
 iske saath hi rakt kii patticas bhi bana lee jaati hai, lekin ilaaj shuru karne ke liye iske parinaamon kii pratiksha nahin kii jaati
 This is also done in many areas where facilities for general laboratory tests are not available
 lekin malawi main hua ek adhyayan bataata he ki bukhaar ke saath-saath yadi guda kaa taapmaana, nakhunon main raktaheenata or tilli ke aakaar ko bhi dhyaan main liya jaae to malaria ke anaavashyak upachaar se bahut bachaa ja saktaa he 
 )
 rakt patticoon kaa sookshmdarshi se pareekshan karnaa malaria ke nidaan kaa sabase sasta, acha tathaa bharosemand tarika mana jaataa he
 The specific symptoms of the four malaria parasites can be diagnosed separately by this test
 rakt patticas do tarah se banaai jaati hai - patali or moti
 Thin plaques can better protect the parasite's texture, on the other hand, thicker plaques can allow more blood to be checked in less time and a lower volume of infection can be diagnosed
 anbhavi pareekshak rakt main 0
 xxrep 6 0 1 pratishat tak ke sankraman ko pahchaan sakate hai
 For these reasons both thick and thin strips are made
 saath hi ek se adhik valay charnon kii jaanch karnaa jaruri hota he, kyonki chaaron parjiviyon ke valay charan bahudhaa ek jaise dikhte hai
 
 malaria ke nidaan ke liye anek antigen-aadhaarit dipstick pareekshan yaa malaria rapid antigen test bhi uplabdh hai
 They require only one drop of blood, and in just 15–20 minutes, the result is not required, laboratory is not required
 ye sookshmdarshi jaanch se thode kamatar maane jate he
 But in areas where microscopic examination facilities are not available or the examiners do not experience the diagnosis of malaria, antigen testing can be done with a drop of blood in the affected area
 sabase pehle in pareekshanon kaa vikaas pi
 failciparum ke kinvak glutamet deehydrogenez ko antigen ke rup main prayog karke kiya gaya
 But soon a test called optimal-it was developed using another enzyme lactate dehydrogenase
 ye kinvak rakt main adhik samay tak maujuud nahin rahete or paraseete kaa khaatmaa ho jane par ye bhi rakt se nikal jate hai, atah in pareekshanon kaa upyog ilaaj kii safalataa yaa vifaltaa jaanane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 optimal-it can also differentiate between falciparum and non-falciparum malaria
 yah pi
 failciparum kaa 0

1 pratishat tak rakt main nidaan kar saktaa he
 Additionally, P
 falciparum can diagnose up to 0
002 percent of malaria parasites in the parachoc-pf blood based on specific histidine-rich proteins, but does not distinguish between falciparum and non-falciparum malaria
 inke atirikt polimarez shrinkhalaa abhikriya kaa prayog karke or aanvik vidhiyon ke prayog se bhi kuch pareekshan viksit kiye gaye hai, lekin ye abhi kaaphi mahange hai, tathaa keval vishisht prayogshaalaon main hi uplabdh hai
 There is still a need to develop cheap, sensory and simple tests that can be used to diagnose malaria in the region
 gambhir malaria ko africa me praayah pahchaan lene main galati hoti he, jiske chalate anya pranaghatak bimariyon kaa ilaaj bhi nahin ho paata he
 The presence of parasites in the blood can be caused not only by severe malaria, but also by many other deadly diseases
 haal ke adhyayan bataate hai ki malaria-janit moorchha or gaiyr-malaria-janit moorchha main antar karne ke liye malarial retinopathy kisi bhi anya pareekshan se behatar he
 In the context of business and organization, management means - to coordinate the work of people by utilizing the available resources efficiently and effectively so as to ensure the achievement of goals
 prabandhan ke antargat aayojan, sanghathan-nirmaan, staffing, netritv karnaa, tathaa sanghathan athwa pahal kaa niyantran karnaa aadi aate hai
 Regardless of whether the organization is large or small, for profit or non-profit, providing services or manufacturing, management is essential for everyone
 prabandh isliye aavashyak he ki vyakti samuhik uddeshyon kii purti main apana shreshthatam yogadan de saken
 Management involves mutually related tasks that all managers perform
 prabandhak alag-alag kaaryon par bhinn samay lagaate hai
 Managers at the higher levels of the organization spend more time on planning and organization than managers at the bottom
 kai lekhakon ne prabandh kii paribhaasha di he
 The word manga is a plural term widely used for all kinds of verbs
 vaise yah kisi bhi udhyam kii vibhinn kriyaaon ke liye mukhya rup se prayukt hua he
 From the above example and the study of the situation, it must have become clear that management is the action which is necessary in every organization in which people are working as a group
 sanghathan main log alag-alag prakaar ke kaary karte hai lekin vah abhi samaan uddeshy ko paane ke liye kaary karte hai
 Management provides direction in people's efforts and achieving the same objective
 is prakaar se prabandh yah dekhtaa he ki kaary puure hon evam lakshya praapt kiye jaaen kam-se-kam saadhan evam nunatam laagat par ho
 Hence, management can be defined as the process of completing tasks with the aim of achieving the objectives effectively and efficiently
 hame is paribhaasha ke vishleshan kii aavashyaktaa he
 There are some words that need to be described in detail
 ye shabd hai- The process used in the definition refers to the primary task or actions that the management performs to complete the tasks
 ye kaary hai- niyojan, sanghathan, niyuktikaran, nirdesan evam niyantran jin par charchaa is adhyay main evam pustak main aage kii jaaegi
 Effective or actually doing the job effectively means actually completing the given task
 prabhavi prabandh kaa sambandh sahi kaary ko karne, kriyaaon ko puraa karne evam uddeshyon ko praapt karne se he
 In other words, its function is to get the final result
 lekin maatr kaary ko sampann karnaa hi paryaapt nahin he iskaa ek or pahalu bhi he or vah he kaarykushalta arthath kaary ko kushaltapurvak karnaa
 Efficiency means doing the job correctly at minimum cost
 isamen ek prakaar kaa laagat-laabh vishleshan evam aagat tathaa nirgat ke bich sambandh hota he
 If we gain more by using less means then we will say that there is an increase in capacity
 kshamta main vruddhi hogi yadi usee laabh ke liye athwa nirgat ke liye kam sadhano kaa upyog kiya jaataa he evam kam laagat vyay kii jaati he
 Input means are those which have the money, goods, equipment and human resources required to do a particular task
 swabhaavik he ki prabandh kaa sambandh in sansadhano ke kushal prayog se he kyonki inase laagat kam hoti he evam ant main inase laabh main vruddhi hoti he
 These two words are related to each other despite being different
 prabandh ke liye prabhavi evam kshamtawan donon kaa hona mahatvapurn he
 Both effectiveness and skill are two sides of the same coin
 lekin in donon pakshon main santulan aavashyak he tathaa kabhi-kabhi prabandh ko kushalta se samjhauta karnaa hota he
 For example it is easy to be effective and ignore efficiency which means completing the work but at a high cost
 udhaaharan ke liye, mana ek company kaa lakshya varsh main 8,000 ikaayiyon kaa utpaadan karnaa he
 To achieve this goal most of the time, the manager was not effective when the electricity was not available, but not efficient because more inputs were used for the same output
 kabhi-kabhi vyavsaay kam sansadhano se maal ke utpaadan par adhik dhyaan kendrit karata he arthath laagat to kam kar di lekin nirdhaarit utpaadan nahin kar paae
 As a result, the goods could not reach the market, hence its demand was reduced and it was replaced by the competitors
 yah kaarykushalta lekin prabhaavapurntaa kii kami kii sthiti he kyonki maal bazaar main nahin pahunch paaya
 Therefore, it is more important for the manager to achieve the goals at the lowest cost
 iske liye prabhaavapurntaa evam kushalta main santulan rakhana hota he
 Generally high work efficiency is accompanied by high effectiveness which is the goal of all managers
 lekin bagaiyr prabhaavapurntaa ke ucch kaary kushalta par anaavashyak rup se jor dena bhi avaanchhneeya he
 Weak management is due to lack of both effectiveness and efficiency
 kuch paribhaashaon ke adhyayan ke pashchaat hamen kuch tatwon kaa pataa lagata he jinhen ham prabandh kii aadharbhoot visheshtaayen kehete hai
 Management serves to fulfill certain objectives
 uddeshy kisi bhi kriya ke apekshit parinaam hote hai
 These should be derived from the basic purpose of the business
 kisi bhi sanghathan ke bhinn-bhinn uddeshy hote hai tathaa prabandh ko in sabhi uddeshyon ko prabhavi dhang se evam dakshata se paanaa hota he
 Objectives can be classified into organizational objectives, social objectives and personal objectives
 prabandh, sanghathan ke liye uddeshyon ke nirdhaaran evam unako puraa karne ke liye uttaradaayi hota he
 It has to achieve many types of objectives in all fields and keep in mind the interests of all the stakeholders like shareholders, employees, customers, government etc
 kisi bhi sanghathan kaa mukhya uddeshy maanav evam bhautik sansadhano ke adhiktam sambhav laabh ke liye upyog hona chahie
 Which means meeting the economic objectives of the business
 ye uddeshy hai- apane aapako jivit rakhana, laabh arjeet karnaa evam badhotaree
 The basic objective of any business is to maintain its existence
 prabandh ko sanghathan ke bane rahane kii disha main praytn karnaa chahie
 For this the organization should earn enough money to meet the costs
 vyavsaay ke liye iskaa bane rahanaa hi paryaapt nahin he
 Management has to ensure that the organization makes a profit
 laabh udhyam ke nirantar safal parichaalan ke liye ek mahatvapurn protsaahan kaa kaary karata he
 Benefits are necessary to meet the costs and risks of the business
 deergh avadhi main apni sambhaavnaaon main vruddhi vyavsaay ke liye bahut aavashyak he
 For this, the growth of business is very important
 udyog main bane rahane ke liye prabandh ko sanghathan vikaas kii sambhaavna kaa puraa laabh uthaanaa chahie
 Business growth can be measured as sales turnover, increase in the number of employees or increase in the number of products or investment of capital, etc
 samaaj ke liye laabhon kii rachana karnaa he
 Whether the organization is a business or a non-business, it has to fulfill some social obligations as it is a part of the society
 iskaa arth he samaaj ke vibhinn angon ke liye anukool aarthik mulyon kii rachana karnaa
 This includes adopting a different environment of production, providing employment opportunities to the deprived sections of the society and providing facilities like school, baby house for the employees
 aage box main ek nigamit saamaajik daayitv ko puraa karne vaale sanghathan kaa udhaaharan diya gaya he
 The organization consists of people from whom their personality, background, experience and purpose are different
 ye sabhi apni vividh aavashyaktaaon ko santushti hetu sanghathan kaa ang banate hai
 These vary from financial requirements such as competitive salaries and other benefits to social needs such as peer recognition and higher level needs such as personal growth and development
 prabandh ko sanghathan main talmail ke liye vyaktigat uddeshyon kaa sanghathanaatmak uddeshyon ke saath milan karnaa hota he
 Management is a universal action that is an integral part of any organization
 ab ham un kuch kaarnon kaa adhyayan karenge jiske kaaran prabandh itnaa mahatvapurn ho gaya he- Management is as old as civilization
 yadhyapi aadhunik sanghathan kaa udgam nayaa hi he lekin sangathit kaary to sabhyataa ke pracheen samay se hi hote rahe hai
 In fact the organization can be considered as the distinguishing feature that distinguishes civilized society from uncivilized society
 prabandh ke prarambh ke vyavhaar ve niyam evam kanoon the jo sarkari evam vanijyik kriyaaon ke anubhav se panape
 Principles and practices of management developed with the development of trade and commerce respectively
 ‘prabandh’ shabd aaj kai arthon main prayukt hota he jo isaki prakruti ke vibhinn pahaluon ko ujagar karte hai
 The study of management has developed along with modern organizations in the past
 yah prabandhakon ke anubhav evam aacharan tathaa siddhanton ke sambadh samooh donon par aadhaarit rahaa he
 In the past, it has developed into a dynamic subject
 jisaki apni vishisht visheshtaayen hai
 But it is necessary to answer a question related to the nature of management whether management is science or art or both
 To answer this, let us study the characteristics of both science and art and see how far the management fulfills them
 kala kya he? kala icchit parinaamon ko paane ke liye vartmaan gyaan kaa vyaktigat evam dakshatapurna upyog he
 It can be obtained through study, observation and experience
 ab kyonki kala kaa sambandh gyaan ke vyaktigat upyog se he isliye adhyayan kiye gaye moolbhoot siddhanton ko vyavhaar main laane ke liye ek prakaar kii moulikta evam rachanaatmakataa kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The basic characteristics of art are as follows- kala yah maanakar chalati he ki kuch saidhantik gyaan pehle se he
 Experts in their respective fields have proposed some basic principles that are used in a particular type of art
 udhaaharan ke liye nrity, jan sambodhan / bhaashan, kala athwa sangeet par sahitya sarvamaanya he
 Use of this basic knowledge varies from person to person
 kala, isiilie atyant vyaktigat avadharana he
 For example, two dancers, two speakers, two artists or two writers will differ in the performance of their art
 sabhi kala vyavhaarik hoti hai
 Art is the creative use of knowledge to current principles
 ham jaanate hai ki sangeet saat suron par aadhaarit he
 But the music composition of a musician is unique or different, it depends on how these notes are used in music creation, which is its own interpretation
 prabandh ek kala he kyonki, yah nimna visheshtaon ko puraa karti he- a manager is a hierarchical knowledge group that clarifies any general truths or general principles
 The basic characteristics of science are as follows: vigyaan, gyaan kaa krambaddh samooh he
 Its principles are based on the relation between cause and consequence
 udhaaharan ke liye, ped se seb kaa tuutakar prithvi par aane kii ghatana gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ko janm detii he
 Scientific theories are first developed through observation and then tested and tested under controlled conditions repeatedly
 vaigyanik siddhant, vaidhata evam upyog ke liye saarvbhaumik hote hai
 On the basis of the above characteristics, we can say that as a management science, it has certain characteristics- sabhi prakaar kii sanghathan prakriyaaon kaa prabandhan aavashyak he
 You must also have observed that organizations require certain qualifications and experience to manage them
 aapane yah bhi paaya hoga ki ek ore to vyavsaay nigamit swaroop main vruddhi hui he to duusari ore vyavsaay ke prabandh par adhik jor diya ja rahaa he
 Does this mean that management is a profession? To know the answer to this question, let us study the salient features of the profession and see if the management fulfills them
 peshey kii nimna visheshtaayen hai All professions are based on a well-defined set of knowledge that can be acquired through education
 peshey main pravesh, pariksha athwa shaikshanik yogyata ke dwaara simit hoti he
 For example, in India, if one wants to become a Chartered Accountant, one has to pass a special examination conducted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India
 sabhi peshey kisi na kisi parishad sabha se jude hote hai jo inamen pravesh kaa niyaman karte hai kaary karne ke liye pramaan patr jari karte hai evam aadhaar samhita taiyaar karte hai tathaa usko lagu karte hai
 To advocate in India, lawyers have to become members of the Bar Council which regulates and controls their actions
 sabhi peshey aachaar samhita se bandhe hai jo unke sadasyon ke vyavhaar ko disha dete hai
 For example, when doctors enter their profession, they take an oath of their work ethic
 peshey kaa mul uddeshy nishtha evam patibaddhta he tathaa apane graahakon ke hiton kii sadhana he
 a lawyer ensures that his client gets justice
 prabandh, peshey ke siddhanton ko puri tarah se puraa nahin karata he
 Well it has some characteristics which are as follows- prabandh ek saarvbhaumik shabd he jise, kisi udhyam main sambandhon ke samooh main ek duusare se jude logon dwaara kuch kaaryon ko karne ke liye upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 Everyone has the responsibility to complete a particular task in this chain of relationships
 is uttardaayitv ko puraa karne ke liye use kuch adhikaar die jate hai arthath nirnay lene kaa adhikaar
 This relationship of authority and responsibility binds individuals to each other as officers and subordinates
 isse sanghathan main vibhinn staron kaa nirmaan hota he
 There are three levels in the authority chain of an organization- ucch stareey prabandh-yah sanghathan ke varishthatam kaaryakari adhikari hote hai jinhen kai naamon se pukaara jaataa he
 It is commonly known as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Head, Deputy Principal etc
 ucch prabandh, vibhinn kaaryaatmak str ke prabandhakon kii team hoti he
 Their basic task is to keep the overall objectives of the organization in mind, to unify the various elements and harmonize the work of different departments
 ucch str ke ye prabandhak sanghathan ke kalyaan evam nirantarata ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai
 They analyze the environment of the business and its impact for the life of the firm
 ye apni uplabdhi ke nae sanghathan ke lakshya evam vyuh-rachana ko taiyaar karte hai
 They are responsible for all the functions of business and their impact on society
 ucch prabandh kaa kaary jatil evam tanaavpurn hota he
 It takes a long time, so full commitment to the organization is required
 madhya stareey prabandh- ye ucch prabandhakon evam neeche str ke bich kii kadi hote hai, ye ucch prabandhakon ke adhinsth evam pratham rekhiy prabandhakon ke pradhan hote hai
 They are commonly called department heads, operations managers or plant superintendents
 madhya stareey prabandhak, ucch prabandh dwaara viksit niyantran yojanaayen evam vyuh-rachana ke kriyanvayan ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai
 In addition, they are responsible for all the functions of first-line managers
 inkaa mukhya kaary ucch stareey prabandhakon dwaara taiyaar yojanaon ko puraa karnaa hota he
 For this paryvekshiya athwa prachaalan prabandhak- sanghathan kii adhikaar pankti main forman evam paryvekshak nimna str par aate hai
 Supervisors directly observe the work of the workforce
 inke adhikaar evam karttavya ucch prabandhakon dwaara banaai gai yojanaon dwaara nirdhaarit hoti hai
 Supervision, managers have an important role in the organization as they communicate directly with the actual work force and communicate the guidelines of middle level managers to the employees
 inhen ke prayatnon se utpaada kii gunvattta ko banaae rakhaa jaataa he, maal kii haani ko nunatam rakhaa jaataa he evam suraksha ke str banaae rakhaa jaataa he
 The quality of workmanship, and mere production, depends on the hard work, discipline and loyalty of the employees
 prabandh ko sanghathan se sadasyon se kaaryon ke niyojan, sanghathan, nideshan evam niyantran evam nirdhaarit uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye sanghathan ke sansadhano ke prayog kii prakriya mana gaya he
 It is already the task of determining what to do, how and who to do
 iskaa arth he uddeshyon ko pehle se hi nishchit karnaa evam dakshata se evam prabhavi dhang se praapt karne ke liye maarg nirdhaarit karnaa
 The purpose of Suhasini's organization is to buy and sell traditional Indian handloom and handicrafts items
 vah bune hue vastra, sajaavat kaa saamaan, paramparaagat bhartiya kapade se taiyaar vastra evam gharelu saamaan ko bechate hai
 Suhasini takes a decision regarding their quantity, color and texture, then allocates resources from different suppliers for their purchase or preparation in their home
 niyojan samasyao ke paidaa hone se koi roak nahin saktaa lekin inkaa purvanumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he tathaa yah jab bhi paidaa hote hai to inako hal karne ke liye aakasmik yojanaayen bana sakati hai
 It manages the task of assigning tasks, dividing tasks into groups, assigning rights and allocation of resources for the implementation of the prescribed plan
 ek baar sanghathan ke uddeshyon ko puraa karne ke liye vishisht yojana taiyaar kar lee jaati he to phir sanghathan yojana ke kriyanvayan ke liye aavashyak kriyaaon evam sansadhano kii jaanch karegaa
 This will determine the necessary tasks and resources
 yah nirnay letaa he ki kis kaary ko koun karegaa, inhen kahan kiya jayega tathaa kab kiya jayega
 Necessary tasks in the organization are divided into the departments and work units capable of management and the relationship of giving rights and details in the authority chain of the organization is determined
 sanghathan ke uchit takanic kaary ke puraa karne evam prachaalan kii kaary kshamta evam parinaamon kii prabhaav purnataa ke sanvardhan main sahaayta karte hai
 Different types of businesses require different frameworks according to the nature of work
 iske sambandh main aap aage ke adhyyon main or adhik padhenge
 In simple terms it means finding the right person for the right job
 prabandh kaa ek mahatvapurn pahalu sanghathan ke uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye sahi yogyata vaale sahi vyaktiyon ko, sahi sthaan evam samay par uplabdh karaane ko sunishchit karnaa he
 It is also called human resource work and includes recruitment, selection, appointment and training of employees
 infosis technology, jo sofratware viksit karti he, ko pranali vishleshankartta evam kaarykram taiyaar karne vaale vyaktiyon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jabaki labmart ko dizinkartta evam shilpakaaron ke team kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The task of directing is to provide leadership, influence and motivation to the employees so that they can complete the assigned work
 iske liye ek aisa vaataavaran taiyaar karne kii aavashyaktaa he jo karmchaariyon ko sarvshereshth dhang se kaary karne ke liye prerit kare
 There are two basic elements of motivation and leadership
 karmchaariyon ko abhiprerit karne kaa arth keval ek aisa vaataavaran taiyaar karnaa he jo unhen kaary ke liye prerit kare
 Leadership means influencing others in such a way that they perform the desired tasks of their leader
 ek acha prabandhak prashansa evam aalochana kii sahaayta se is prakaar se nirdesan karata he ki karmchaaree apana shreshthatam yogadan de saken
 Suhasini's team of designers developed ravishing colors on silk for bed sheets
 yadhyapi yah bahut lubhaavne lagate the lekin silk ke prayog ke kaaran aam aadmi ke liye yah bahut adhik mahange the
 Praising her work, Suhasini suggested that she keep these silk sheets for special occasions like Deepawali, Christmas and print them regularly on cotton clothes
 niyantran ko prabandh ke kaary ke us rup main paribhaashit kiya he jisamen vah sanghathan ke lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye sanghathan kaary ke nishpaadan ko nirdeshit karata he
 Levels of execution are determined in the control function, the current performance is measured
 iskaa purvanirdhaarit staron se milan kiya jaataa he or vichlan kii sthiti main sudharatmak kadam uthaae jate hai
 For this, managers have to determine what work and production are important for success, how and where it can be measured and who is authorized to take corrective steps
 suhasini ne jab paaya ki uske dizinkartaaon kii team ne palang kii vah chadar banaai jo unki vikray ke liye nishchit mulya se adhik mahangi thi tab usne laagat par niyantran ke liye chadar hetu kapadaa hi badal diya
 The various functions of the manager are usually discussed in the above order according to which a manager prepares the plan first; Then creates organization; Thereafter directs; And finally controls
 vastav main prabandhak shaayad hi in kaaryon ko ek-ek karke karata he
 The tasks of the manager are related to each other and it becomes difficult to determine which work ended where and which work started from where
 kisi sanghathan ke prabandhan kii prakriya main ek prabandhak ko paanch ek duusare se sambandhit kaary karne hote hai
 Organization is a system that is made up of interconnected and interconnected subsets
 prabandhak ko in bhinn samoohon ko samaan uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye ek duusare se jodna hota he
 The process of monotony of activities of different departments is called coordination
 samanvay vah shakti he jo, prabandh ke anya sabhi kaaryon ko ek duusare se baandhti he
 It is a thread that threads all functions such as purchasing, production, sales and finance to maintain consistency in the work of the organization
 samanvay ko kabhi-kabhi prabandh kaa ek alag se kaary mana jaataa he
 But it is the essence of management because it brings unity in individual efforts to achieve collective goals
 prayek prabandhkeey kaary ek aisi gatividhi he jo swayan akeli samanvay main sahyog karti he
 Coordination is targeted and embedded in all the functions of any organization
 sanghathan kii kriyaaon ke samanvay kii prakriya, niyojan se hi prarambh ho jaati he
 Higher management plans for the entire organization
 in yojanaon ke anusaar sanghathan dhaanchon ko viksit kiya jaataa he evam karmchaariyon kii niyukti kii jaati he
 Implementation of schemes is required according to plan to ensure that guidance is required
 vaastavik kriyaaon evam unki uplabdhiyon main yadi koi matbhed he to iskaa niraakaran niyantran ke samay kiya jaataa he
 Through the process of co-ordination, the management makes proper arrangements for individual and collective efforts to ensure unity in the steps taken to achieve the same objectives, the co-ordination will unify the different functions and efforts of different units of the organization
 is
 yah prayatnon kii aavashyaktaa raashi, maatr, samay evam krambaddhata uplabdh karaata he jo niojit uddeshyon ko nunatam virodhabhas, praapt karne ko sunishchit karata he
 The following characteristics of coordination are clear from the above definitions- samanvay samuhik kaaryon main ekaatmakataa laata he- samanvay aise hiton ko jo ek duusare se sambandhit nahin hai yaa ek duusare se bhinn hai uddeshy purna kaary gatividhi main ekta laata he
 It provides a focal point to the group's actions, which ensures that the execution is in accordance with the plan and schedule
 samanvay kaarywahi main ekta laata he- samanvay kaa uddeshy samaan uddeshyon ko praapt karne ke liye kaarywahi main ekta laana he
 It serves as the power to connect various departments and ensures that all actions are taken to achieve the goals of the organization
 aapane paaya ki labmart ke utpaadan evam vikray vibhaagon ko apane kaaryon main samanvay karnaa hota he jisase ki bazaar kii maang ke anusaar utpaadan kiya ja sake
 Coordination is a continuous process - Coordination is not a one-time function but a continuous process
 yah niyojan se prarambh hota he evam niyantran tak chalati he
 Suhasini makes a plan regarding clothes for winter time in the month of June itself
 tatpashchaat vah paryaapt kaarybal kii vyavastha karti he
 According to the production plan, it is constantly monitored for this, it will have to tell its marketing department in time to prepare for the promotion of sales promotion and advertising
 samanvay sarvyaapee kaary he- vibhinn vibhaagon kii kriyaayein prakruti se ek duusare par nirbhar karti hai isiilie samanvay kii aavashyaktaa prabandh ke sabhi staron par hoti he
 It establishes unity in various departments and functions at different levels
 sanghathan ke uddeshy bana virodh aa sake, praapt karne ke liye suhasini ko kray, utpaadan evam vikray vibhaagon ke kaaryon main samanvay karnaa hota he
 The task of purchasing department is to buy cloth
 yah utpaadan vibhaag kii kriyaaon ke liye aadhaar ban jaataa he or ant main vikray sambhav ho paata he
 If the fabric is of inferior quality or does not have the specifications prescribed by the production department, then further sales will be reduced
 yadi samanvay nahin he to kriyaaon main ekta evam ekikaran ke sthaan par punrariti evam avyavashtha hogi
 Coordination is the responsibility of all managers - coordination is the task of every manager in any organization
 Higher level managers coordinate with their subordinates to ensure that the organization's policies are implemented
 madhyastar ke prabandhak, ucchstar ke prabandhakon evam pratham pankti ke prabandhakon, donon ke saath samanvay karte hai
 Operations level managers coordinate the tasks of their employees to ensure that the work is done according to plans
 samanvay sochaa-samajha kaary he- ek prabandhak ko vibhinn logon ke kaaryon kaa dhyanpurvak evam soch samajhakar samanvay karnaa hota he
 In a department, members work voluntarily in cooperation with each other, coordination coordinates this spirit of cooperation
 samanvay ke na hone par sahyog bhi nirarthak siddh hoga or bina sahyog ke samanvay karmchaariyon main asantosh ko hi janm degaa
 Therefore we can say that coordination is not a separate function of management but it is its essence
 yadi koi sanghathan apane uddeshyon ko prabhavi dhang se evam kushalta se praapt karnaa chahta he to use samanvay kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Coordination is an integral part of all the functions of coordination in the same way as the thread in the rosary
 vibhinn prabandhkeey kaaryon ko ekikrut karnaa vyaktiyon evam vibhaagon main paryaapt maatr main samanvay ko sunishchit karata he
 As such, the constant change inherent in a large-scale organization due to coordination problems is weak or passive leadership and complexities
 bade sanghathanon main is prakaar kii jatiltaaon ke samanvay ke liye vishesh prayatnon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Size of organization - Large number of people engaged in large organizations complicate the problem of coordination
 prayek vyakti apane aap main vishisht he
 And realizes the needs of himself and the organization
 prayek kii apni kaary karne kii aadaten hai, apni prishthbhumi hai, paristhitiyon se nipatane ke prastaav / tareeke hai tathaa dusron se sambandh hai
 By the way, a single person does not always act wisely
 uske vyavhaar ko na to sadaa thik se samajha jaataa he or na hi puri tarah se uskaa purvanumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, for the efficiency of the organization, it is essential that the objectives of the individual and the group are integrated by coordination
 kaaryaatmak vibhedikaran- sanghathan ke kaaryon ko baar-baar vibhaagon, prabhaagon, virgon aadi main baanta jaataa he
 The problem of coordination arises because the jurisdiction becomes stronger and the barriers between them become even stronger
 kai baar yah isliye hota he kyonki kaaryon kaa vargeekaran yukti sangat nahin hota yaa phir prabandhak tark sangat maarg na apana kar anubhav kaa maarg apanaate hai
 In such cases, coordination is necessary to function effectively in the organization
 vishishtikaran- aadhunik sanghathanon main ucch str kaa vishishtikaran he
 Specialization is born due to the intricacies and functions of modern technologies and the diversity of those who do them
 visheshgy sochate hai ki ve ek duusare ko peshey ke aadhaar par jaanchne ke yogya hai lekin duusare logon ke paas is prakaar ke nirnay kaa koi paryaapt aadhaar nahin ho saktaa
 If experts are allowed to work without coordination in front of a global manager, the results will be very expensive
 isiilie sanghathan main lage vibhinn visheshgyon ke kaaryon main samanvay hetu ek rachana tantra kii aavashyaktaa he
 Coordination is the essence of management
 yah kuch aisa nahin he taki jiske liye ek prabandhak aadesh de
 Rather it is something that a manager tries to achieve by planning, organizing, appointing, directing control tasks
 atah prayek kaary samanvay kaa abhyaas he
 Organization and their management is changing
 jaise-jaise vibhinn samskritiyon evam deshon kii seemayen dhundhlee pad rahi hai evam sampreshan kii nayi-nayi takneekon ke kaaran vishwa ko ek vaishvik gaanv samajha ja saktaa he
 International and intercultural relations are also growing rapidly
 aaj kaa sanghathan ek vaishvik sanghathan he jiskaa prabandh bhumandaleey paridrishy main kiya jaataa he
 In summary, one can say that a global manager is one who has both 'hard' and 'soft' skills
 jo prabandhak vishleshan karnaa, vyuharachna karnaa, ejineering evam praudyogiki kaa gyaan rakhte hai unki aaj bhi aavashyaktaa he lekin vishwavyaapee safalataa ke liye vyaktiyon main team kaise kaary karti he, sanghathan kaise kaary karte hai evam logon ko kis prakaar se abhiprerit kar saktaa he, is sabaki samaj kaa hona bahut aavashyak he
 For example, a manager who has access to different cultures can work in Western Europe, a non-english speaking country, then move to developing countries like Malaysia or Kenya and then to an office in New York, USA
 Can be transferred
 vah in teenon sthanon par turant prabhavi dhang se kaary kar sakegaa
 The role of global manager has evolved in the same way that global industry and economy have developed
 yah ek paribhaashit vyavsaay ke sandarbh main ek aiami bhoomika se bahuaiami bhoomika main parivartit ho gaya he jiske liye takneekee kaushal, sofrat prabandh evam kaushal evam vibhinn samskritiyon ko grahan karnaa evam seekhney ke sammishran kii aavashyaktaa hoti he

 People are visibly frightened to hear this story and try to find out the description of the face of the liquor manager and his sycophant Tavo
 buskemi kahata he ki vah us vyakti kii shakl nahin jaanata or yah tipanni karata he ki, shaayad vah vyakti isi ore aayaa he

 vah el ko bataata he ki vah abhi jis sharabghar main gaya tha vahaan se vah yah pataa lag saktaa he ki buko kahaan he
 Buscemi asks l what he will do after taking his revenge
 el sirf itnaa hi kahata he ki badla puraa karne ke baad sab samaapt ho jaayegaa
 is par buskemi kahata he ki vah is baat se prasann he
 It comments on El Buscemi that he never had the ability to tolerate such incidents
 vah jawaab detaa he:"tumhaare andar bhi yah kshamta nahin thi
 "el then clears up to look like a mariaqui and heads to the city
 vah ek chote ladke se miltaa he or use sikhaata he ki guitar bajaate samay apni ungaliyon ko dhilaa chhod dena chahie, jabaki is shrankhla kii pehali film main vah moko dwaara chalaayi gayi goli se lage ghaav ke kaaran apane baayen haath kii ungaliyon kaa prayog kar paane main asamarth dikhaaya jaataa he
 Meanwhile, Bucho is apparently concerned that the "black man" is coming to find him
 vah apane aadamiyon ko aadesh detaa he ki kisi bhi ajanabi ke prati hoshiyaar rahen oe vah ek abhedya limogin bhi kharidta he
 After this, l goes to the liquor
 vahaan ke sangrakshak buskemi dwaara bataayi gayi kahani ke kaaran use andeh kii drushti se dekhte hai, haalanki vah vaisaa bilkul bhi nahin dikhataa jaisaa varnan us kahani main kiya gaya tha sirf kaale kapadon ko chhodkar
 vah log praapt jaankaree ke anusaar, hathiyaar hone kii ashanka main el ke guitar ko kholkar dekhte hai or tab tak use bandook kii nok par roke rakhte hai, par unhen sirf guitar dikhataa he
 He lets her go, that is when he sees that the guitar inside the box containing the guitar is just a cover to hide his guns
 vah use maarane kaa prayaas karte hai lekin vah apni aasteen se do chupaayi hui rayugar P90 
45 asipi pistal nikaal letaa he or un aadamiyon ke saath bandook dwaara bheeshan ladaai karne lagata he
 Meanwhile, in a secret room, several other men watch the video of a fight between them and Tavo kills the man who brought and delivers the drug because he thinks he has cheated them
 el sharabghar prabandhak ke alawa anya sabhi vyaktiyon ko maarane lagata he or us par dabaav daalata he ki vah el ko buko ke paas le jaye, isi dauraan vah usase kuch prashn bhi karata he, durghatnapurvak use ek gopneey kamare main chupe ek vyakti dwaara maathe par goli lag jaati he
 They try to shoot at each other but they are fired, they try to use the guns of the people on the ground but see that they are all empty
 antat us aadmi ko ek bhari hui bandook milti he or vah iske dwaara el par goli chalaane kaa prayaas karata he, lekin el uski gardan par waar kar detaa he
 He then leaves the tavern, unaware that Tavo, a friend of the tavern's manager and a partner of Bucho's, is following him, who publicly carries with him two pistols, a Desert Eagle and a Ryuger P90
 Has happened
 jab vah raste par chal rahaa tha, tabhi uski nazar apni ore aati hui ek sundar yuvati par padati he
 l gets smarter by seeing the woman's astonished gesture towards the person standing behind her, and as soon as the bullet hits his arm, at the exact moment El removes the girl from the path, but he succeeds in killing Tavo
 goes
 baad main, el ek kitaab kii dukaan par hosh main aata he or dekhtaa he ki ek mahila uski baanh par taanke laga rahi he
 She states that her name is Carolina
 vah aspataal janaa chahta he lekin vah kahati ki use aspataal nahin janaa chahie anyathaa vah log use dekh sakate hai
 At this he asks her where she is and she says that this is her bookstore, but her work is not going well
 iske baad vah us mahila dwaara di gayi dardanivarak goliyon ke asar se so jaataa he
 Carolina finishes some work and comes back to her shop
 vah utsukathavash uske guitar vaale sandook ko kholti he or dekhati he ki usame guitar rakhaa he, lekin phir vah paati he ki usame el kii badooken hai
 Then l catches him
 vah kahati he ki ab vah samaj gai ki vah koun he vah usase darati hui nahin lagati
 tab vah use apni ek bandook uphaar ke rup main dene kaa prastaav rakhata he, lekin vah manaa kar detii he
 He then leaves to go to church, where he meets Buscemi who tells him that he should leave in time, as he himself is doing
 is par el buskemi kaa peechha karata he or usase bahes karne lagata he, use phir se yah khabar nahin hoti ki uskaa peechha kiya ja rahaa he, is baar ek aise anya vyakti dwaara jo el kii hi tarah kaale kapade pahentaa he, joki puri film ke dauraan el kaa peechha karata he
 He then tells Buscemi that he should, eventually, leave it
 buskemi uske is vichaar se sahamat hota he, lekin tabhi vah navajas dwaara, jo kai chaaku phenk rahaa tha, maar diya jaataa he
 After this, l also gets hurt, but he is just injured and runs into a street
 navajas vishwaspurvak pravesh dwaar par uski pratiksha kar rahaa tha
 Bucho's limousine, in which his girlfriend and his men were full, stops behind to find out her identity
 vah apni chaaku dwaara uske kai aadamiyon ko maar daalata he, lekin iske baad use goli lag jaati he
 Without anyone's notice, l manages to escape and he again accidentally meets the little boy he had met earlier, who wants to show l his real guitar
 el uske peeche jaataa he, use spasht rup se bahut dard ho rahaa tha or kaaphi khun bhi bah rahaa tha
 a car arrives there and a man sitting inside makes a guitar deal with the boy
 phir vah kuch aage tak us car se jate hai or el ko dekhte hai
 The person in the car attempts to take out the gun, but l is quicker than that and asks for another guitar
 vah use guitar de dete hai or car se aage chale jate hai
 Then he breaks in to see her, he finds a packet of cocaine inside him
 vah chote ladke se is bare main prashn karata he jo use yah bataata he ki shahar kaa prayek vyakti isamen shaamil he or kai vyapaaron kii aad main yah vyapaar chal rahaa he; jisame carolina kii kitaab kii dukaan bhi shaamil he
 Enraged, l heads back to the bookstore
 isi bich, buko ke aadmi navajas kii laash waapas kar dete hai
 Bucho calls his superiors and asks the man Hulia whom they sent in search of El
 jo huliya use bataaya jaataa he vah navajas se miltaa tha, lekin buko yah maanane ko taiyaar nahin hota ki uske aadamiyon ne usee aadmi ko maar daalaa jise uske varisht adhikariyon ne el ko dhundne ke liye bheja tha
 He then punishes his assistant for thinking that El is a wonderful person
 kitaab kii dukaan par laut kar el, carolina par chillaata he, vah is baat par naaraaz tha ki vah bhi us vyakti ke liye kaam kar rahi he jo hatya karnaa chahta he or uskaa gussa is baat par bhi tha ki usee vyakti ke kaaran uske mitra, buskemi kii bhi hatya hui he
 Carolina says that she does not work for Bucho, she just picks up and leaves the goods from her shop, and for this she gets $ 50,000 a year
 vah kahati he ki use jo bhi milaataa he usame se vah kuch kitaab kii dukaan ko chalaane main kharch karti he or baaki isliye bachaati he ki shaayad use kabhi yahaan se janaa pade, lekin ek baar is kaam se jud jane ke baad use ise chhodane kii anumati nahin thi
 Hearing this, l calms down and lays on the counter so that he can clear her wound, but Bucho arrives there and Carolina quickly pushes El behind the counter
 vah carolina se poochta he ki kya usne kisi ajanabi ko dekha he, lekin vah kahati he ki usne kisi ajanabi ko nahin dekha he or yadi dekhegi to use zarur phone karegi
 Behind the counter, El attempts to silently fire bullets into his gun, but does not know before Bucho leaves
 He tries to go from there to chase Bucho, but Carolina says it would be like committing suicide and that he should wait longer
 baad main, jab el ke ghaav bhar rahe the or vah swasth laabh kar rahaa tha, carolina use uphaar ke rup main ek guitar detii he
 They both try to play the guitar together, but are unable to do so
 Carolina kisses El, and the two begin a relationship in Carolina's bedroom
 isi bich, buko apane aadamiyon ko shahar bulaata he or unhen kahata he ki vah kitaab kii dukaan kii talaashi len or yadi el vahaan ho to, kitaab kii dukaan main aag lagaakar un donon ko maar daalen
 agle din, el jaag jaataa he jabaki carolina apni ankhen band karke gaanaa ga rahi thi, el ko pardon ke madhyam se do sashastr aadamiyon kii parchhaayi dikhaai padati he
 He silently grows to take one of his pistols and a double gun and remove Carolina from his path while driving and killing both of them
 vah kitaab kii dukaan kii ore se bhaagane kaa prayaas karte hai, lekin phir dekhte hai ki vahaan aag lag chuki he
 He tries to reach the roof, killing many men and finds that the way to reach the top is also closed due to people falling on the ground
 carolina kuudati he jabaki el aadamiyon par goli chalaata he or phir vah apane guitar rakhane vaale sandook ko bagal vaali imaarat kii ore phenk detaa he
 After this, the men follow him and he is forced to jump backwards while shooting at them
 vah palatataa hua bina kisi chot ke zamin par pahunch jaataa he
 He then uses a grenade to kill the last remaining goons
 chat par chupane ke dauraan, el buko ko aata hua dekhtaa he
 He attempts to shoot a targeted Wilde Magnum on Bucho's head but stops seeing Bucho's face and throws the gun away
 carolin usase puuchhati he ki usne kyun us par goli nahin chalaayi
 el koi jawaab nahin detaa or vah donon ek hotel main jaakar sharan lete hai
 l tells her that she can run away and use the capital she raised to start a new life, without l killing Bucho, but Carolina says that the money is hidden in those books Was now burnt
 tab el apane mitron, campa or quino ko bulaane kaa nirnay letaa he
 He arrives shortly thereafter and follows him to a deserted place in the city, where Bucho's men find him
 campa or quino yah prakat karte hai ki unke paas bhi kuch khaas sandook hai, campa ke do sandukon main mashinagan the or quino ke paas jo sandook tha vah ek rocket prakshepak tha
 He kills several of Bucho's men with Carolina's help
 chat par ek gunde dwaara quino kii maut ho jaati he or ammo se bhaagane ke dauraan campa kii bhi maut ho jaati he
 The little boy is also trapped in this cross-firing and is badly injured
 el or carolina aakhri aadmi ko bhi maar daalate hai, jo ki buko kaa pramukh sahaayak tha or bachche ko aspataal pahunchane ke liye zaldi karte hai
 After the doctor is unable to say for sure whether the child will survive, El angrily arrives at Bucho's farm to avenge the conflict

 At the beginning of the program a year was planned for the last song "trivar Jayajayakar, Rama" where Ram becomes king
 lekin 1955 ke hindu calendar main adhik maas tha
 So four songs were added to increase the series to a total of 56

 laad ne baad main kavi ko sabhi aavashyak lekhan saamagree se susajjit kamaron main band karne kaa nirnay liya or kaha ki unhe tab rihaai milegi jab ve geet liye taiyaar hon
 Madgulkar memorized and wrote the song again in fifteen minutes so that Phadke could produce the music
