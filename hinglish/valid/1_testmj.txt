 Martin was more of a concern to EMI than the original 1965 stereo remix, he felt "too woolly, and not at all what he thought would be a good subject"
 martin mul chaar trek tepe karne ke liye waapas chalaa gaya or unhen sterio ke liye rimix kiya
 One of the most notable changes is the echo added to "dizzy Miss Lizzy", something that was not apparent on the lp's original mix
 jab album mul rup se canada main sidi ko jari kiya gaya tha, pressings anya deshon se aayaat or 1987 rimix istemaal kiya gaya
 However, when Disc American and Sinarum Plant in Canada started pressing albums, the original 1965 stereo mix was used by mistake

 Geometry or geometry is one of the three huge branches of mathematics
 isamen binduon, rekhaon, talon or thos chizon ke gunaswabhaav, maapan or unke antariksh main saapekshik sthiti kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Geometry is one of the oldest branches of knowledge
 jyamiti ganit kii vah shakha he jisamen binduon, rekhaon, vakron, samatalon ityadi kaa adhyayan hota he
 This science originated from land-related tasks, hence this mathematics is also called Bhumiti
 armbh main yah adhyayan rekhaon tathaa rekhaon se ghire kshetron ke gunon tak hi simit rahaa, jiske kaaran jyamiti kaa naam rekhganit bhi he The construction of Yajnavedis in India attracted the attention of mathematicians to the study of geometry, their study was more akin to field committee
 itihashyagyon kaa mat he ki bharatvasi isa se 1,000 varsh purv aise sambandh jaise 32 + 42 = 52 jaanate the, parantu aise hi katipay chhutput samikarnon ke atirikt unhone aise sambandhon kaa kisi vyapak rup se adhyayan nahin kiya
 About 600 years before Christ, the Roman mathematician Pithgauras studied this relationship in a logical manner and stated that the square on the hypotenuse in a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares above the other arms
 vaise to jyamiti kaa adhyayan sabhi puraane sabhy deshon, jaise misr, babilonia, china, bharat tathaa yunaan, main lagbhag saath hi saath aarambh hua, parantu jitani unnati is vigyaan main yunaan ne kii utani kisi or desh ne nahin kii
 About 300 years before Christ, Euclid, a mathematician from Greece, sorted all the facts that were known by that time in a very logical manner
 gyaat tathyon ke aadhaar par usne anya tathy siddh karne kaa praytn kiya
 In this way, on sorting the facts, he reached some preliminary facts which are difficult to prove
 vaise ve bilkul spasht prathit hote hai
 These facts are so simple that Euclid accepted them as axiomatic and called them facts themselves
 inhen tathyon par jyamiti ke pramayon kaa pramaan nirbhar he
 Those facts are the following: 1
 ve vastuen, jo ek hi vastu ke baraabar hon, aapas main bhi baraabar hoti hai
 2
 If equal items are added to equal items then the sum is equal
 3
 yadi baraabar vastuon main se baraabar vastuen gata di jaayan to sheshfal baraabar hote hai
 4
 Equals equal to equal objects
 5
 yadi do rekhaon ko teesri rekha kaate or ek ore ke ant:konon kaa yoga do samakon se kam ho to jidhar jod kam he udhar hi donon rekhaayen badhaai jane par ek bindu par milengi

 Similarly in creation, you can also create from one composition to another, but in the end we reach some such compositions, whose use does not depend on other experiments
 in rachanaaon ko bhi swayan prayog maanakar hi aage bad sakate hai
 They inke atirikt ve koi or tathy bina siddh kiye hue sweekaar nahin karte
 Four of the above five facts themselves are so simple and clear that proving them is equivalent to proving your hand, but the fifth does not seem to be axiomatic
 ganitagyon ne is tathy ko swayansiddh maanane main aapatti kii or ise siddh karne ke bahut ytn kiye
 These efforts resulted in great inventions
 isi prakaar jyamiti main nae nae paribhaashik shabdon kaa ullekh hota he
 The definition of one word depends on the definition of other words
 ant main dekhte hai ki ye paribhaashaayen bindu, rekha or tal kii paribhaashaon par aadhaarit hai
 According to Euclid, the plane is one in which the length is the width, but the thickness is not
 bahut se log is paribhaasha par bhi andeh karne lage hai, parantu thodaa manan karne se yah spasht ho jayega ki paribhaasha thik he
 For example, if two liquids are filled in a glass vessel that do not meet each other, then when they become stable then we will see that one plane separates the two substances
 usamen motaai nahin he
 If it were, there would be a space between the two fluids that neither contained the substance below nor the top, but it is impossible
 is udhaaharan se spasht ho gaya hoga ki tal main motaai nahin hoti
 It only has length and width
 isi prakaar dhoop main kisi samtal diwaar kii chaaya dekhakar ham kah sakate hai ki rekha main chaudaai nahin hoti
 The line is located in the plane, so the thickness of the floor is the thickness of the line
 isaliye rekha main na motaai hoti he na chaudaai, keval lambaai hi hoti he
 If the lines meet at a point, then the width of the line is the length of the point, that is, there is neither length, nor width, thickness in the point
 keval sthaan hi hota he
 Everyone will be aware that in geometry, the properties of triangles, squares, circles, cones, cylinders, etc
, are studied
 un prashnon ke halon ne bahut vichaarvardhan kiya, isamen koi shankaa nahin, jaise aisa ghan bananaa jiskaa ghanfal die ghan kaa duguna ho
 At that time, the meaning of composition was understood to be composed with the help of tracks and compasses
 doosraa prashn tha aisa varg bananaa jiskaa kshetrafal die hue vrutt ke kshetrafal ke baraabar ho
 The third question was to divide a given angle into three equal parts
 yah kaam patari or parkaar se asambhav he, parantu anya upayon se ho saktaa he
 These questions kept mathematicians busy for centuries
 inke vivechan se ganitjgat kaa bahut laabh pahunchaa, isamen koi andeh nahin
 The Greeks also studied the properties of the ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola curve formed by cutting a cone from a plane
 in adhyayanon ne capalan ko apane niyam gyaat karne main badi sahaayta di hogi
 Until the 15th century, geometry was often the study of measurement properties, but after that, properties were also studied which do not depend on measurement; For example, if the vertices of two triangles are on a three pointed line, the corresponding sides meet on a line
 is saadhy ne ganitagyon kaa dhyaan ek anya prakaar kii jyamiti kii ore aakrisht kiya jise prakshepiy jyamiti kehete hai
 If we pay attention to the picture of a scene, we feel that by seeing it, we get complete knowledge of the scene
 parantu chitra main vrutt vrutt nahin rahata, na sabhi samaantar rekhaayen samaantar rahati he, na samakon samakon hi, balki kabhi samakon nune kone dikhaai detaa he, kabhi adhik kone; phir bhi drishy main kuch aise gun he ki akritiyon ke badalane par bhi chitra se unka puraa gyaan hota he
 These qualities are called invesure
 aise hi gunon kaa prakshepiy jyamiti main adhyayan hota he
 Suppose a point b and a quadrilateral KB are dotted
 yadi bindu ba se chaturbhuj ke prayek bindu ko milaanevaali rekhaayen khinchi jaayan or unhen badha den or phir ek samtal se in rekhaon ko kaaten to is tal par ek chitra banegaa
 That trajectory of this quadrilateral and this experiment will be called the relative transformation of point B
 isi prakaar doosraa bindu lekar uske saapeksh is prakshep kaa bhi prakshep nikaal sakate hai
 The properties that do not change are studied by interpolation into a simple polygon
 ye gun mul bahubhuj ke liye bhi thik honge
 Also, many conversions are similar to a conversion experiment
 in prayogon kaa bhi adhyayan is jyamiti kaa ang he
 If the center of a sphere or circle is a and the radius is the radius and if a point b is distance from the center a and if r is the second point in the line b at a distance, where r 1 is the second then then any point of b is There will also be a path to compatible b

 Euclid did all the discussions on the plane itself, but now there are different discussions on each type of plane
 iskaa vivechan kathin he, at: iske liye pathak is vishay kii vishesh pustakon kaa avlokan karen
 In the middle of the 17th century, the French mathematician Decart made it very powerful by using algebra in geometry
 usne pehle do katati hui rekhaayen leen, jinhen aksh kehete hai
 The distance measured in parallel to these lines of a point is determined by its number or two
 ye rekhaayen bindu ke nirdeshaank kehalaati hai
 With the help of these coordinates each geometric fact can be represented by an algebraic equation
 is jyamiti kaa kai dishaao main vikaas hua
 In the first case, a broader form of geometry emerged, such that the equation of an exponent represents a simple line
 isi prakaar do ghaat kaa sameekaran ek shankav pradarshit karata he
 Similarly, the equations of powers three, four and higher began to be studied and the properties of their corresponding curves became much simpler than before
 tal ke vakron tak hi nahin, avkaash ke vakron kaa bhi adhyayan sambhav ho gaya
 For this, the points of a point from a three-point plane are determined by its distance and represent each point along an equation in Y, R, L
 in samikarnon ke vivechan se talon ore vakron ke gunon kaa adhyayan saralata se hota he
 In the other direction, the solution of composition related questions and activities became very simple
 ye kriyaayein keval kuch samikarnon ke hal par hi nirbhar hai, jisamen bahut vyapak prashn saralata se hal ho jate hai; jaise yadi rekha kisi vakr = o ko katati he, to in donon samikarnon ke hal unke kataan binduon kaa sthaan nishchit karenge
 If the origin of these equations is real, the line cuts the curve
 yadi baraabar hai to rekha vakr ko sparsh karti he
 If imaginary, the line does not intersect the curve, but we can say that the line will always cut the curve at two points, whether the points are real or coincident, or imaginary
 isi prakaar se tathy bade vyapak rup main die ja sakate hai, jo saadhaaran jyamiti main sambhav nahin tha
 In the third direction, coordinate geometry broadened the dimension
 do sankhyaayein ya, r do vimitiyon main tathaa teen sankhyaayein teen vimitiyon main kisi bindu kaa sthaan nishchit karti hai
 Now, the question arose in front of mathematicians as to what the four numbers Y, R, L, and the five numbers Y, R, L, V, would represent
 ganitagyon ne to amoort rup se apane mastishk main badi aasaani se soch liya ki chaar sankhyaayein chaar vimitiyon main or paanch sankhyaayein paanch vimitiyon main kisi bindu kaa sthaan nishchit karengi
 In this way, he also thought well of the anomalies
 unhen isse koi matlab nahin ki parthiv jagat main uskaa koi udhaaharan he yaa nahin
 Einstein must have used this idea in his theory of relativity and clarified the idea of aversion
 ab is ucch vimiti ke vichaar kaa aprayukt ganit main kuch kathin samasyaon ko hal karne main upyog karte hai
 For example, the number of different particles in a moving fluid is represented by seven numbers
 ve hai k, kha, ga, uskaa praarambhik sthaan, tathaa teen veg, jo ya, r, l aksh ke samaantar hon, tathaa samay, yah saat vimiti kaa prashn samajhakar hal ho saktaa he
 In the fourth direction, coordinate geometry generalized numbers and imaginary numbers emerged
 kalpanik bindu tathaa kaalpanik vakr ityadi vichaaron ne jyamiti ko bahut mahatvashaalee bana diya, jisase vyapkikaran main or adhik sahaayta mili, jaise anant par do kaalpanik binduon se janevaala shaankab vrutt hota he, ityadi
 In addition, geometry was discussed with the help of different types of coordinates, such as quadratic coordinates, triangular coordinates, tangent coordinates, etc
 nirdeshaankon ke prayog ke lagbhag 50 varsh baad hi kalan kaa prayog bhi jyamiti main hone laga
 This experiment generated new ideologies in geometry

 Archimedes died c 212 BC The Second Punic War took place when Roman armies led by General Marcus Claudius Marcellus captured the city of Syracuse after a two-year siege
 plutark ke dwaara die gaye lokapriy vivaran ke anusaar, archimedes ek ganitiya chitra par vichaar kar rahe the, jab shahar par kabza kiya gaya
 a Roman soldier ordered him to come and meet General Marcellus, but he refused, saying that he had to complete work on his problem
 isse sainik naaraaz ho gaya or usne apni talwaar se archimedes ko maar daalaa
 Plutarch also gives an account of the death of Archimedes, less-known, stating that he was probably killed when he was attempting to surrender to a Roman soldier
 is kahani ke anusaar, archimedes ganitiya upkaran le ja rahe the or unhen isliye maar diya gaya kyonki sainik ne sochaa ki ye keemtee saamaan he
 General Marcellus is said to have been greatly enraged by Archimedes' death, as he considered him an invaluable scientific asset and ordered that Archimedes should not be harmed in any way
 mana jaataa he ki archimedes ke antim shabd the, "mere vruton ko pareshaan mat karo ", yahaan vruton kaa sandarbh us ganitiya chitra ke vruton se he jise archimedes us samay adhyayan kar rahe the jab roman sainik ne unhen pareshaan kiya
 These words are often described in Latin as "noli turbare circulos meos", but there is no reliable evidence that Archimedes uttered these words and they are not found in the description given by Plutarch

 The most widely known fact about Archimedes is how he discovered a method for determining the volume of an object of an irregular shape
 vitruvius ke anusaar, raja hero II ke liye ek lorel vreth ke aakaar kaa ek nayaa mukut banaaya gaya tha or archimedes se yah pataa lagane ke liye kaha gaya ki yah mukut shuddh sone se bana he yaa beyimaan sunar ne isamen chaandi milaayi he
 Archimedes had to solve this problem without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it into a regular-sized object to calculate its density
 nahaate samay, unhone dekha ki jab ve tub ke andar gaye, tub main pani kaa str upar uth gaya or unhone mahasoos kiya ki is prabhaav kaa upyog mukut ke aaytan ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Water cannot be compressed for practical purposes, so the submerged crown will replace its volume with equal amounts of water
 mukut ke bhaar ko pratisthapit pani ke aaytan se vibhajit karke, mukut kaa ghanatv praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 If cheap and low density metals are added to it, then its density will be less than gold
 phir kya tha, archimedes apni is khoj se itane zyada uttejit ho gaye ki ve kapadey pahananaa hi bhul gaye or nagn avasthaa main galiyon main bhaagate hue chillane lage "ureka !" The story of the gold crown does not appear in the known works of Archimedes
 iske alaava, pani ke visthaapan ke maapan main aavashyak sateekta kii atyadhik maatra ke kaaran, iske dwaara varnit vidhi kii vyavhaarikta par sawaal uthaaye gaye hai
 Perhaps Archimedes gave a solution that applied to a theory called Archimedes' theory in hydrology, which he describes in one of his texts on floating bodies
 is siddhant ke anusaar ek taral main dubi hui vastu par ek utplavan bal lagata he jo iske dwaara hathaaye gaye taral ke bhaar ke baraabar hota he
 Using this principle, it would have been possible to compare the density of the gold crown with solid gold, for which the crown would have been first balanced on a scale with a sample of gold, then the mechanism would have been immersed in water
 
 yadi mukut sone se kam ghanaa tha, isane apane adhik aaytan ke kaaran adhik pani ko pratisthapit kiya hoga or is prakaar is par lagane vaale utplavan bal kii maatra namoonay se adhik rahi hogi
 This difference in buoyancy may have been seen on the scale
