 ek-ek karke nau sir chadhaane ke baad dasavaan sir bhi kaatane ko hi tha ki shivaji prasann hokar prakat ho gayi
 He turned his head ten times and asked him to ask for a boon

 Shivji gave permission, but with the warning that if he puts it on the road, he will become immovable there
 antatogatva vahi hua
 Ravana walked with Shivalinga, but on coming to a Chitabhoomi on the way, he needed a brief retirement
 ravan us ling ko ek ahir ko thama laghushanka-nivritti karne chalaa gaya
 Here, he felt very heavy from that Ahir and placed it on the ground
 phir kya tha, lautne par ravan puri shakti lagaakar bhi use na ukhaad sakaa or niraash hokar murti par apana angutha gadaakar lanka ko chalaa gaya
 Here the gods of Brahma, Vishnu etc
 came and worshiped that Shivling

 The condition of taking the Jyotirlinga was that there is no place to keep it in the middle, but with Dev Yoga, Ravana became intolerant to the rapid velocity of small-time and started giving Jyotirlinga the form of the changed shepherd of God
 us charvaahe ne jyotirling ko jameen par rakh diya
 In this way Vaidyanathdham was built on the name of the shepherd

 Due to the vague nature of suffering, the issue of prawn fish can be argued with the analogy - that shrimp biology is similar to human biology or that shrimp behavior supports those hypotheses Is that shrimp can feel pain

 In particular, the solitary crabs were more severely jerked, showing an increasing desire to leave their existing armors and move to new ones, and they took relatively little time to decide to move into those new shells
 Furthermore, because the researchers had not provided the new armor until the electric shock process was stopped, this change in behavior was a result of a recall of the damaging event, not a rapid response
 merudanddhariyon main, antarjaat opids neurochemicals hai jo opiyet abhigrahakon ke saath parsparik sampark karne par dard ko kam kar dete hai
 Opioids are found naturally in peptide and opiate receptor crustaceans, and although the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety claims that "no definitive conclusions can be made right now, critics consider their presence as a sign of this" Are that shrimp fishes experience pain
 uparokt ullikhit scottish paper yah kahata he ki merudanddhariyon or zinga machhliyon ke opids "ek hi tarah se dard ko kam kar sakate hai"
 Morphine, which is a pain reliever and naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, affects related species of crustaceans in the same way that they affect vertebrates: Morphine ingestion in crabs has a protective response to electric shocks

 These findings have been replicated for other spinal cordless species, but similar data for shrimp fishes are not yet available
