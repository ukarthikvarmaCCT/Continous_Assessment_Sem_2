 aarti shabd ke anek arth ho sakate hai - Jihad is an Arabic word that literally means to try or struggle with a particularly admirable purpose
 iske islamic sandarbh main arth ke bahut se rang hai, jaise ki kisi ke buraai jhukaav ke khilaaf sangharsh, avishvaasiyon ko badalane kaa prayaas, yaa samaaj ke naitik bharose kii ore se prayaas, islamic vidwaanon ne aamtaur par rakshaatmak yuddh ke saath sainya jihad ko samanta pradaan kii he
 In Sufi and religious circles, spiritual and moral jihad has traditionally been emphasized in the name of greater jihad
 is shabd ne aatankwaadi samoohon dwaara apane upyog ke dwaara haal ke dashakon main atirikt dhyaan aakarshith kiya he
 It is very important in Islam
 do tarah ke jehad bataae gaye hai
 One is jihad al-akbar i
e
 big jihad and second is jihad al-asghar i
e
 small jihad
 jihad shabd aksar quran main sainya arthon ke bina dikhaai detaa he, aksar muhaavareydaar abhivyakti "ishwar ke maarg main prayaas kar rahaa he"
 Islamic jurists and other ulema of the classical era understood the obligation of jihad primarily in a military sense
 unhone jihad se sambandhit niyamon kaa ek vistrut set viksit kiya, jisamen un logon ko nuksaan pahunchane ke pratibandh shaamil hai, jo ladaai main shaamil nahin hai
 In the modern era, the notion of jihad has lost its judicial relevance and has instead given rise to an ideological and political discourse
 jabaki aadhunik islamic vidwaanon ne jihad kii rakshaatmak or gaiyr-sainya pahaluon par bal diya he, Jihad al-akbar is a non-violent struggle
 The best jihad is the word of justice before the punishing Sultan - quoted by Ibn Nuhas and narrated by Ibn Habban
 1
 Attempt to fight against all the evils within themselves and to fight against such evils that appear in the society
 2
 nasleey bhed-bhav ke viruddh ladanaa or auraton ke adhikaar ke liye prayaas karnaa 3
 To be a better student, to be a better partner, to be a better business partner and above all to control your anger jehad al asgar kaa uddeshy islam ke sangrakshan ke liye sangharsh karnaa hota he
 When freedom of observance of Islam is not given, hindered, or attacked in a Muslim country, exploited, tortured and tortured, it is Jihad al-asghar to try to stop it and make sacrifices for it
 gregorian calendar {gregory kaaldarshak}, duniya main lagbhag har jagah upyog kiya jane vaala kaaldarshak yaa tithipatrak he
 This is the adaptation of the Julian calendar
 ise pope gregory ne lagu kiya tha
 Prior to this, the Julian calendar was in vogue, but it contained many errors, which were corrected in the Gregorian calendar
 gregory kaaldarshak kii mul ikai din hota he
 There is a year of 365 days, but every fourth year is of 366 days, which is called leap year
 surya par aadhaarit panchang har 146,097 dinon baad doharaaya jaataa he
 It is divided over 400 years and equals 20871 weeks
 in 400 varshon main 303 varsh aam varsh hote hai, jiname 365 din hote hai
 And there are 97 leap years, consisting of 366 days
 is prakaar har varsh main 365 din, 5 ghante, 49 minute or 12 second hote he
 In the Julian calendar, 365 days was considered a 6-hour year, but assuming it takes 11 minutes 14 seconds more than a revolutionary solar year each year
 yah aadhiky 400 varshon main 3 din se kuch adhik ho jaataa he
 Pope Gregory of Rome first considered this mistake subtly
 unhone isvi san 1582 main hisaab lagaakar dekha ki naaise nagar ke dharm-sammelan ke samay se, jo isvi san 325 main hua tha, purvokt aadhiky 10 din kaa ho gaya he, jisko gananaa main nahin lene ke kaaran taarikh 10 din peeche chal rahi thi
 With this idea, he decided the 15th of October in 1582 AD in consultation with the astrologer Allay Sius Lilius of Naples, and since then took the rule that the century, if divided completely by 400, instead of being completely divided by year 4 It should be considered as leap year or not
 is naveen paddati kaa aarambh chunki pope gregory ne kiya, isliye isko gregorian paddati athwa naveen paddati kaha gaya
 This method was accepted in different Christian countries in different years
 isse in deshon kaa itihaas padhate samay is baat ko dhyaan main rakhana aavashyak he
 This new method was adopted by Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal in 1582, Prussia, the Roman Catholic Territories of Germany, Switzerland and Flanders in 1583, Poland in 1586, Hungary in 1587, Protestants from Germany and the Netherlands
 Territory and Denmark in 1700, British Empire in 1752, Japan in 1972, China in 1912, Bulgaria in 1915, Turkey and Soviet Russia in 1917 and Yugoslavia and Su Romania adopted in 1919 AD
 1582 isvi ke baad 1700 i0 main 28 farvari tak puraane calendar se naye calendar kii taarikh main 10 din kii hi vruddhi rahi
 Since 1600 AD was a century, it was completely divided by 400, so it would have been a leap year by the new method
 atah usamen taarikh main antar karne hetu 1 din kii vruddhi nahin hui
 This means that changing the date from the old calendar to the new calendar will be progressively increased from the aforesaid 10 days to one day in the same century years in which the 400 years do not completely participate
 arthath 1700 isvi kii 28 farvari ke baad naye calendar kii taarikh banane ke liye 10 din kii jagah 11 din jode jaayenge
 Similarly, 12 days will be added after 28 February of 1800 AD and 13 days after 28 February of 1900 AD
 punah 2000 i0 400 se puri tarah vibhajit hone ke kaaran yah vruddhi 13 din kii hi rahegi, atirikt 1 din nahin badhegaa

 Describing the faults of modern civilization, Rousseau presents the difference between natural and orthodox like other thinkers of his time
 kintu prakritik avasthaa kii kalpana uske rajya sambandhi vichaaron kii pushti ke liye anaavashyak si he
 According to Rousseau, life was easy in the natural state
 buddhi tathaa bhashaa kaa vikaas nahin hua tha
 Man used to behave according to his instincts
 vah naitikta aniatikta se pare tha
 We cannot call it happy, nor sad

 In this description, the situation before the state revolution of France is reflected
 isi sthiti se makti paane ke liye saamaajik prasanvida kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 From the observation of early works of Rousseau and some parts of the social covenant, it appears that the author is opposed to social order and believes in absolute freedom of the individual
 kitu ruso swayan aalochakon dwaara varnit samanta kii utpatti ke ghor vyaktvaad or "saamaajik prasanvida' ke ghor samashtiwad ke paraspar virodh ko nahin maanata
 His purpose in his early works was merely a rebuttal of popular beliefs
 kitu saamaajik prasanvida main vah apana swatantra darshan prastut karata he
 According to him, man is a social animal
 samaaj main hi uske manvochit gunon kaa vikaas ho saktaa he
 How the present society binds him with unnecessary and malicious bonds
 prasanvida kaa uddeshy aise samaaj kii sthapana karnaa he jo apni sampurna samuhik shakti ke dwaara prayek sadsy kii swatantraaa or sampatti kii raksha kar sake or jisamen prayek vyakti samshti main sammilit hokar bhi apni hi ajna kaa paalan kare or purvawat swatantra bana rahe
 For this, each person delegates his entire powers to the society under the highest direction of the general resolution and then acquires all those rights as an inseparable part of the society
 prasanvida ke parinamswaroop jis rajya kii utpatti hoti he vah ek naitik avyavi he jiskaa apana swatantra sankalp hota he
 This general resolution, which always prevails in the protection and welfare of both the society and the individual, is the source of legislation and the standard of justice in society
 spasht he ki aisa samaaj prasanvida kaa parinaam kadaapi nahin ho saktaa, kyonki prasanvida kii purna manyata vyakti kii naitik tathaa taarkik praathamikta he, na ki samaaj kii
 Rousseau distinguishes between the general resolution and the resolution of all
 sabakaa sankalp vishesh sankalpon kaa yoga maatr he jo vyaktigat hiton ke hi str par rah jaataa he
 The general resolution is always self-interest and for the common good
 kabhi kabhi ruso bahumat ko hi saamaanya sankalp kah detaa he
 He also says that the remnant that remains due to the collision of conflicting views is the general resolution
 kitu ye baaten uski mul dharna ke viruddh hai
 The principle of social covenant generates the paradox of freedom
 ruso ke anusaar saamaanya sankalp sthaayee avibhajya tathaa adey he
 He is always true
 vyakti kaa hit usee se sannihit he
 Since man cannot have the liberty to act against his own interest, the person who opposes the general resolution is actually self-loathing
 saamaanya sankalp kaa murtarup hone ke naate rajya use sachche arth main "swatantra' hone ke liye baadhya kar saktaa he
 Punishment is also a form of freedom
 is prakaar yah siddhant swatantraaa ke naam par adhinayakawad kaa poshak ban jaataa he
 It is not right to say that Russo himself is a supporter of totalitarianism, because he says that the sovereign cannot violate the valid practices of society
 saamaajik hit ke liye vyaktigat swatantraaa aavashyak he
 Rousseau states legislators are necessary for the state
 uski aavashyaktaa isliye padati he ki yadhyapi janata sarvada lokkalyaan chaahati he tathaapi usko samajhane main vah sadaiv samarth nahin hoti

 As long as the power is in the hands of the public, the form of government is secondary
 sarkaar keval janata ke hit kaa saadhan he
 Therefore, it can be changed at any time
 gairke ne ise "nityakranti kaa siddhant kaha he
 Russo discusses two aspects of government: the administrator and the executive
 vyavasthapika ko vah shreshth bataata he, kyonki saamaanya sankalp usee ke dwaara vyakt hota he
 Political parties are a hindrance in the expression of the general resolution
 at: ruso unke viruddh he
 In a committee sense, he describes religion as useful to the state
 samaaj kii suvyavastha ke liye rajya ko dharm ke kuch sisaddhanton ko nirdisht kar dena chahie or janata ko unhen maanane ke liye baadhya karnaa chahie
 As far as rationalist individualism and natural laws exist in Russia, it is a matter of differences
 kintu isamen andeh nahin ki usne in siddhanton kaa atikaraman kiya or aadhunik rajdarshan main unani drushtikon ko pun: pratishthit kiya jiske anusaar rajya kii samuhik chetana hi vyakti kii naitikta or swatantraaa kaa strot he

 Saying a social contract often implies two meanings
 prathmat: saamaajik sanvida-vishesh, jiske anusaar prakritik avasthaa main rahane vaale kuch vyaktiyon ne sangathit samaaj main pravisht hone ke liye aapas main sanvida yaa tehraav kiya, at: yah rajya kii utpatti kaa siddhant he
 Others may be called government contracts
 is sanvida yaa tehraav kaa rajya kii utpatti se koi sambandh nahin varan rajya ke astitv kii purv kalpana kar yah un manyataon kaa vivechan karata he jin par us rajya kaa shashan prabandh chale
 The discussion of social contract started later in the historical development, the logical order of both these forms of contract
 parantu jab sanvida ke aadhaar par hi samast raajnneeti shaastra kaa vivechan prarambh hua tab in donon prakaar kii sanvidaaon kaa prayog kiya jane laga - saamaajik sanvida kaa rajya kii utpatti ke liye tathaa sarkari sanvida kaa uski sarkaar ko niyamit karne ke liye
 Although the principle of social contract is found in its sprout form in Socrates' ideas, Sophist political philosophy and Roman legislation, and Mangold linked it to the principle of public rights, its first detailed discussion was found in medieval political philosophy as government contract
 is
 sarkaar ke aadhaar ke rup main sanvida kaa yah siddhant ban gaya
 This idea was not only in favor of medieval feudal society but also in favor of medieval Christian monks because it was helpful in setting the boundaries of state power
 16veen shatabdi ke dharmik sangharsh ke yug main bhi yah siddhant bahusnkhyakon ke dharm ko aropit karne vaali sarkaar ke prati alpsankhyakon ke virodh ke auchity kaa aadhaar bana
 As such it served the purposes of both Calvinism and Romanism minorities
 parantu kalantar main sarkari sanvida ke sthaan par saamaajik sanvida ko hi hobbs, lock or ruso dwaara prashray praapt hua
 Obviously a government contract cannot be discussed without believing in a social contract, but a social contract is definitely possible without trusting a government contract
 saamaajik sanvida dwaara nirmit samaaj shaasha or shasit ke bich antar kiye bina or isiilie unke bich ek anya sanvida kii sambhaavna ke bina bhi, swaittshasit ho saktaa he
 This was the principle of Russo
 duusare, saamaajik sanvida par nirmit samaaj sangrakshan ke rup main kisi sarkaar kii niyukti kar saktaa he jisase yadhyapi vah koi sanvida nahin karata tathaapi sangrakshak ke niyamon ke ulanghan par use chyut kar saktaa he
 This was Locke's theory
 ant main ek baar saamaajik sanvida par nirmit ho jane par samaaj apane sabhi adhikaar or shaktiyaan kisi sarvasattadhari samprabhu ko saunp saktaa he jo samaaj se koi sanvida nahin karata or isiilie kisi sarkari sanvida kii simaaon ke antargat nahin he
 This was Hobbes's theory
 sambhavtah bharat main hi parakramee raja tathaa saamaajik sanvida kaa mahatv sabase pehle samajha gaya
 The views expressed in Manusmriti, Shantiparva of Mahabharata and Arthashastra of Chanakya support the social contract
 mahabharat main bhishma kehete hai- Expressing the importance of social contract, Bhishma further says that we have heard that in the past, chaotic subjects devoured each other like big fish in water
 bhishma aage kehete hai- But Bhishma says that 'a man who wants wealth should want to worship the king in the same way that Indra is worshiped
 raja ko 'daivi' mana jaataa tha
 Similar thoughts have come in Dighnikaya
 saamaajik sanvida ke siddhant par aghat yadhyapi hegel ke samay se hi prarambh ho gaya tha tathaapi david hum dwaara ise sarvapratham sarvaadhik kshati pahaunchi
 According to Hume, government is founded not on consent, but on practice and thus as the basis of political gratitude and Burke criticizes the contract on the basis of evolutionary theory
 saamaajik sanvida kaa siddhant na keval aitihaasikta kii drushti se apramanit he varan vaidhanik tathaa darshanik drushti se bhi doshapurn he
 For a contract to be valid, it must have the patronage and support of the state; There is no mention of any such power behind social contract
 isliye yah avaidhanik he
 Secondly, the rules of contract are imposed only on the contractors, not on their offspring
 saamaajik sanvida ke siddhant kaa darshanik aadhaar bhi trutipurna he
 The notion that the relation of the individual and the state is based on individual independent determination is not true
 rajya na to kritrim sristi he or na isaki sadsyta aichhik he, kyonki vyakti icchaanusaar isaki sadsyta na to praapt kar saktaa he or na to tyaag hi saktaa he
 Secondly, it divides human history into two stages, natural and social; There is no logical basis for such division; Today's civilization is considered as natural as it was in the early period
 tisare, yah siddhant is baat kii purv kalpana karata he ki prakritik avasthaa main rahane vaala manushya sanvida ke vichaar se avgat tha parantu saamaajik avasthaa main na rahane vaale ke liye saamaajik uttardaayitv kii kalpana karnaa sambhav nahin
 If a natural state governed by natural legislation is accepted, then in such a situation, the establishment of the state will not reflect progress, but it will be reflective of retrograde, because instead of natural legislation, it would be regressive to adopt state power based on force
 yadi prakritik avasthaa aisi thi ki vah sanvida kaa vichaar pradaan kar sake to yah maananaa padegaa ki manushya tab bhi saamaanya hit ke prati sachet tha; is drushti se use saamaajik satta tathaa vaiyaktik adhikaar ke prati bhi sachet hona chahie
 And then there is no difference between natural and social conditions
 ant main, jaisaa green ne kaha, is siddhant kii pramukh truti iskaa anaitihaasik hona nahin varan yah he ki isamen aadhaar kii kalpana unhen samaaj se asambaddha karke kii gai he
 The basis of rights in a logical manner is the consent of society; Rights are possible only among those whose tendencies and desires are intellectual
 atev prakritik adhikaar adhikaar na hokar maatr shaktiyaan hai
 But despite all these errors, the principle of social contract is a strong basis for providing stability to the government
 yah siddhant is vichaar ko pratishthapit karata he ki rajya kaa aadhaar bal nahin vikalp he kyonki sarkaar janasahmati par aadhaarit he
 From this point of view, this principle is one of the cornerstones of democracy

 Swaraj literally means 'self-government' or "one's own kingdom"
 bharat ke rashtriya aandolan ke samay prachlit yah shabd aatm-nirnay tathaa swadhinata kii maang par bal detaa tha
 The early nationalists, considering independence as a far-reaching goal, preferred the goal of 'good government' over 'self-government'
 tatpashchaat ugravadi kaal main yah shabd lokapriy hua, jab bal gangadhar tilak ne yah udghoshnaa kii ki ‘‘swaraj meraa janm siddh adhikaar he or main ise lekar rahoonga
 Gandhi first said in 1920 that "my Swaraj is a demand for parliamentary rule for India, which will be based on adult suffrage
" gandhi kaa mat tha swaraj kaa arth he janpratinidhiyon dwaara sanchalit aisi vyavastha jo jan-aavashyaktaaon tathaa jan-aakankshaon ke anuroop ho
 In fact, Gandhiji's idea of swaraj was a movement to boycott Britain's political, social, economic, bureaucratic, legal, military and educational institutions
 yadhyapi gandhiji kaa swaraj kaa sapana puri tarah se praapt nahin kiya ja sakaa phir bhi unke dwaara sthapit anek swayamsevi sansthaaon ne is disha main kaaphi prayaas kiye
 Gandhi's concept of 'swaraj' is very broad
 swaraj kaa arth keval raajnneetik str par videshi shashan se swadhinata praapt karnaa nahin he, balki isamen saanskrithik va naitik swadhinata kaa vichaar bhi nihit he
 It emphasizes mutual cooperation and reconciliation in nation building
 shashan ke str par yah ‘sachche loktantr kaa paryaay’ he
 Gandhi's Swaraj is 'swaraj of the Poor', which inspires the salvation of the oppressed
 yah aatm-sayanm, gram-rajya va satta ke vikendrikaran par bal detaa he
 Gandhi supported 'sarvodaya' i
e
 all-welfare
 ahisantmak samaajaigandhi kii drushti main adarsh samaaj-vyavastha vahi ho sakati he, jo purnatah ]]ahimsa]]tmak ho
 Where the idea of violence itself will disappear, there will be no need for 'punishment' or 'use of force', that is, there will be no need for political power or state in an ideal society
 gandhi hinsa tathaa shoshan par aadhaarit vartmaan raajnneetik dhaanche ko samaapt karke, uske sthaan par ek aisi vyavastha sthapit karnaa chaahate the, jo vyakti kii sahmati par aadhaarit ho tathaa jiskaa uddeshy ahimsaatmak tareekon se jan-kalyaan main yogadan dena ho
 According to Gandhi, a non-violent society would be stateless
 vah rajya kaa virodh is aadhaar par karte hai, ki na to yah swaabhaavik sanstha he or na hi aavashyak he
 He, like the philosophical anarchist, rejected the state on this basis - gandhi ke anusaar raajnneetik shakti saadhy nahin balki prayek kshetra main logon ke vikaas main sahyog dene kaa saadhan he
 It regulates national life by national representatives
 yadi rashtriya jivan itnaa paripurna ho jaae ki aatmaniyamit ho jaaain to kisi bhi pratinidhi kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 In such a situation, each ruler is his own
 vah swayan par is prakaar shashan karata he, ki vah apane padosi ke liye baadha nahin banataa
 In such an ideal situation there is no political power, because there is no state in it
 gandhi ne use ‘‘prabud araajaktaa kii sthiti’’ kaha he
 This is 'ram Rajya'
 tollstoy ne ise ‘‘prithvi par parameshwar kaa rajya’’ kaha he
 Gandhi's stateless, classless society will be divided into many self-governed and self-sufficient village communities
 prayek gram-samudaay kaa prashasan paanch vyaktiyon kii panchayat chalaaegi, jo gramvaasiyon dwaara nirvaachit hogi
 The gram panchayats will have legislative, executive and judicial powers
 gram panchayaton ke upar mandalon kii, unke upar jilon kii tathaa jilon ke upar praanton kii panchayate hongi
 Above all, there will be a Central Panchayat for the entire nation
 prayek gaanv apni aavashyaktaaon kii purti tathaa suraksha kii drushti se swazlambi hoga
 There will be no military power and police
 bade nagar, kanoonee adaalatein, karagaar tathaa baari udyog nahin honge
 There will be decentralization of power
 prayek gaanv swayamsevi rup se sangh se sambaddh hoga
 Gandhi has called it 'real self-rule'
 gandhi kaa maananaa tha ki is prakaar ke sangh ke prabandh va samposhan ke liye sarkaar aavashyak hogi
 Therefore, a modern critic is of the view that Gandhi's ideal society was primarily a non-violent state, not a non-violent, stateless society
 duusari ore aabid hossain kaa mat he ki gandhi kaa ram rajya purna araajaktaavaadi rajyaviheen samaaj he, jo naitik kanoon dwaara shasit he
 In this type of non-violent society, peace and order will be established by the power of love or self-confidence in the form of satyagraha
 gandhi ke anusaar satyagrah vyaktiyon, virgon tathaa rashtron ke madhya shoshan tathaa daman kaa pratirodh karne kaa prabhaavapurn yantra he
 Gandhi was of the view that the goal of establishing a stateless and classless non-violent society would not be easily achieved
 atah rajya ko tatkaal samaapt karnaa thik he
 Consequently, their goal is to mold the state in accordance with the principles of non-violence
 ahimsak rajya main saamaajik vyavhaar ko niyamit karne hetu ek prakaar kii sarkaar tathaa raajnneetik satta hogi, kintu vah kam se kam shashan karegi, kyonki saamaajik jivan aatm niyamit hoga
 The person will get complete freedom
 adhikansh kaary swayamsevi sansthaaon dwaara sampann honge
 These ideas of Gandhi resemble guild socialists like Russell, G

 Cole
 gandhi kaa janatantric samaaj ek samaajawaadee rajya hoga
 Being influenced by Bhagwat Purana, he believed that - gandhi nijee sampatti ke samaapan ke paksh main nahin hai kintu aarthik samanta laana chaahate hai
 Economic equality means adequate and balanced food for all, housing and khadi to cover the body
 vah swadeshi kaa paksh lete hue kutir va laghu udyog tathaa khaadi udyogon ke vikaas par bal dete hai
 Gandhi opposed the production by technology oriented industries or machines and instead gave preference to labor intensive industries
 unke anusaar utpaadan logon dwaara kiya jaae, factriyon dwaara nahin
 Gandhi taught under the 'labor principle' that every person should contribute to their consumption by doing manual labor
 chunki isamen prayek prakaar kii seva yaa shram ko ek jaisaa sammaan diya jayega, isliye shram kii garima sthapit hogi tathaa vargeey bhed mit jane se ‘vargvihin’ samaaj kii sthapana hogi
 Gandhi has not supported the acquisition of property of landowners and capitalists
 isai samaajwaadiyon kii tarah vah poonjipatiyon kii manovriti main prem va anunay dwaara parivartan laakar apana aarthik samanta kaa lakshya praapt karnaa chaahate the
 The capitalist should not consider himself as the owner of the property and should be considered as trustee or trustee
 jo sampatti unke paas he, use ve samaaj kii dharohar samajhen
 Out of that they spend as much for themselves as is appropriate for their services, give the rest of the society a lot, that is, distribute among the poor
 utpaadan kaa lakshya munafa ne hokar sampoorn samaaj kaa hit hona chahie
 There should be participation in the management of workers
 yadi poonjipati trustee bananaa sweekaar na karen, to kanoon dwaara rajya ko bhoomi tathaa utpaadan ke anya sadhano par niyantran kar lenaa chahie
 Gandhi has propounded the principle of Sarvodaya in terms of general interest or welfare of all
 yah siddhant aisi niti kaa samarthan karata he, jiskaa uddeshy jaat-paat, dharm-sampradaay, stri-purush, oonch-neech aadi ke bhedbhaav mitaakar samaaj ke sabhi staron par kalyaan kaary ko badhaava dena he
 This will develop mutual cooperation and goodwill
 gandhi ke sarvoday kaa siddhant rajya ke lakshya kaa siddhant he
 Utilitarian thinkers Bentham and JS While Mill was in favor of "maximum welfare of the most people", John Ruskin favored the "last or neglected minority"
 gandhi ne in donon siddhanton ke sammishran se ek nayaa siddhant pratipaadit kiya, jise sarvoday yaa ‘‘samaaj ke sabhi logon ke utthan yaa kalyaan’’ kaa siddhant kaha jaataa he
 Later Vinoba Bhave followed this principle
 gandhi paramparaagat arth main na to raajnneetik chintak the or na hi siddhant nirmaataa the, kintu vah bhartiya swadhinata aandolan ke agradoot tathaa shreshth samaaj sudhaarak the
 On the one hand, he led the non-cooperation, Civil Disobedience and Quit India Movement on the basis of truth and non-violence, on the other hand campaigned against casteism, communalism and untouchability
 maikayavali ke vipareet unhone raajnneeti va naitikta main sambandh sthapit kar saadhan va saadhy main sambandh sthapit kiya
 Like the Western liberals, he believed in personal freedom and representative democracy
 rajya ke uddeshy ke rup main unki sarvoday kii sankalpana mahatvapurn he
 Being a Karmayogi, Gandhi believed in the dignity of labor
