 but the fame and prestige he received from novels and stories , She could not get it from other genres
 yah sthiti hindi or urdu bhashaa donon main samaan rup se dikhaayi detii he
 Premchand's novels are milestones not only in Hindi novel literature but also in Indian literature
 premachand katha-sahitya main unke upanyaaskaar kaa armbh pehle hota he
 His first Urdu novel Asrar Maabid aka Devasthan Rajya was published in serial form in Urdu weekly "awaaz-e-khalk" from 8 October 1903 to 1 February 1905
 unka doosraa upanyaas 'hamakhurma va hamsawab' jiskaa hindi roopantaran 'prema' naam se 1907 main prakashit hua
 Since Premchand was originally the author of Urdu and came from Urdu into Hindi, all his early novels were originally written in Urdu and later he was written in Hindi
 unhone 'sevasadan' upanyaas se hindi upanyaas kii duniya main pravesh kiya
 He originally wrote it in Urdu under the name 'bajare-hussan' but first published its Hindi form 'sevasadan'
 'sevasadan' ek nari ke veshya banane kii kahani he

 Ram Vilas Sharma, the main problem expressed in 'sevasadan' is the subordination of the Indian woman

 Premchand had started a revolutionary change in Hindi fiction by making Surdas, a blind beggar, a hero of fiction in Rangbhoomi
 godaan kaa hindi sahitya hi nahin, vishwa sahitya main mahatvapurn sthaan he
 In it, Premchand's literary ideology achieves perfection from 'idealistic realism' to 'critical realism'
 ek saamaanya kisaan ko puure upanyaas kaa nayak bananaa bhartiya upanyaas parampara kii disha badal dene jaisaa tha
 The death of Hori, a storyline trapped in the cycle of feudalism and capitalism, shakes the minds of readers

 ye naatak shilp or samvednaa ke str par achche hai lekin unki kahaniyon or upanyaason ne itani oonchaai praapt kar lee thi ki naatak ke kshetra main premchand ko koi khaas safalataa nahin mili
 These plays have become really interactive novels

, while editing magazines and magazines in the then other co-existing literary magazines 'chand', 'maryada', 'swadesh' etc

 Both the story and the novel made epoch-making changes
 unhone sahitya main samayikta prabal aagrah sthapit kiya
 He made the common man the subject of his creations and, by openly penning his problems, placed him on the post of heroes of literature

 He continued to write for a lifetime on communalism, corruption, zamindari, indebtedness, poverty, colonialism
 premachand kii zyaadaatar rachanaaen unki hi garibi or dainyata kii kahani kahati he
 It is also not wrong that he was the creator of the common Indian
 unki rachanaaon main ve nayak hue, jise bhartiya samaaj achhut or ghrunit samajha tha
 He used the language of simple, easy and common language and presented his progressive ideas strongly to the society
 1936 main pragatisheel lekhak sangh ke pehle sammelan kii adhyakshata karte hue unhone kaha ki lekhak swabhaav se pragatisheel hota he or jo aisa nahin he vah lekhak nahin he
 Premchand is the era promoter of Hindi literature
 unhone hindi kahani main aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad kii ek nai parampari shuru kii
 Despite being such a great creator, Premchand's life is not free from accusations
 premchand ke adhyeta kamalkishor goyanka ne apni pustak 'premchand : adhyayan kii nai dishaaen' main premchand ke jivan par kuch aarope lagaakar unke sahitya kaa mahatv kam karne kii koshish kii
 The main allegations against Premchand are- Premchand left his first wife without any reason and even after second marriage, he had a relationship with another woman, Premchand cheated Vinodashankar Vyas in 'jagran Brawl', Premchand's senior press Employee Pravasi Lal Verma Frauded, Workers Strike in Premchand's Press, Premchand Supports Flick When His Daughter Sick Took more
 kamalkishor goyanka dwaara lagaae gaye ye aarope premchand ke jivan kaa ek paksh jarur hamaare saamne laate hai jisamen unki insaani kamajoriyon jaahir hoti hai lekin unke vyapak sahitya ke moolyankan par in aaropon kaa koi asar nahin pad paaya he
 People remember Prem Chandra today because of his ability which gives very little space to controversies
 premchand ko praayah "munshi premchand" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 When and how did 'munshi' become associated with Premchand's name? Most of the people in this subject believe that Premchand was a teacher in the beginning
 adhyapakon ko praaia: us samay munshi ji kaha jaataa tha
 Apart from this, there has been a tradition of putting the word 'munshi' as a form of honor before the names of Kayasthas
 sambhavat: premchand ji ke naam ke saath munshi shabd judakar rudh ho gaya
 According to Professor Shukdev Singh, Premchand never used the word 'munshi' himself in front of his name
 unka yah bhi maananaa he ki munshi shabd sammaan suchak he, jise premchand ke prashansakon ne kabhi laga diya hoga
 This fact is based on conjecture
 lekin premchand ke naam ke saath munshi visheshan judane kaa pramanik kaaran yah he ki 'hans' naamak patr premchand evam 'kanhaiyalaal munshi' ke sah sampadan main nikalataa tha
 On some copies of which Kanhaiyalal Munshi's full name was not printed, but 'munshi' was printed and also Premchand's name was printed in this way
 sampadakmunshi, premchand'hans ke sampadak premchand tathaa kanhaiyalaal munshi the
 But over time, the readers accepted 'munshi' and 'premchand' as one and became 'premchand' - 'munshi Premchand'
 yah swaabhaavik bhi he
 The general reader often reads the author's works, not seeing the subtlety of the name
 aaj premchand kaa munshi alankaran itnaa rudh ho gaya he ki maatr 'munshi' se hi premchand kaa bodh ho jaataa he tathaa 'munshi' na kehane se premchand kaa naam adhuraa-adhuraa sa lagata he
 Premchand did many experiments to reach the pinnacle of his art
 jis yug main premchand ne kalam uthaai thi, us samay unke peeche aisi koi thos viraasat nahin thi or na hi vichaar or pragatishiltaa kaa koi model hi unke saamne tha sivaay bangla sahitya ke
 At that time Bankim was Babu, Sharat Chandra and in addition there were Russian writers like Tolstoy
 lekin hote-hote unhone godaan jaise kaaljayi upanyaas kii rachana kii jo ki ek aadhunik clasik mana jaataa he
 He coined and shaped things himself
 jab bharat kaa swatantraaa andolan chal rahaa tha tab unhone katha sahitya dwaara hindi or urdu donon bhashaaon ko jo abhivyakti di usne siyaasi sargarmi ko, josh ko or andolan ko sabhi ko ubhaara or use taaqatvar banaaya or isse unka lekhan bhi taaqatvar hota gaya
 Premchand can certainly be called the first progressive writer of Hindi in this sense
 1936 main unhone pragatisheel lekhak sangh ke pehle sammelan ko sabhapati ke rup main sambodhan kiya tha
 His speech became the basis of the manifesto of the progressive movement
 premchand ne hindi main kahani kii ek parampara ko janm diya or ek puri peedi unke kadamon par aage badi, 50-60 ke dashak main renu, nagarjun auki inke baad shrinath singh ne gramin parivesh kii kahaniyaan likhi hai, wo ek tarah se premchand kii parampara ke taratamya main aati hai
 Premchand was a revolutionary creator, he saw not only patriotism but also many evil practices prevalent in the society and put them before the people through the story
 unhone us samay ke samaaj kii jo bhi samasyaayen thim un sabhi ko chitrit karne kii shuruyaat kar di thi
 Dalits also come in it, women also
 ye sabhi vishay aage chalakar hindi sahitya ke bade vimarsh bane

 He died untimely at the age of 22 in Mathura
 The cause of Shiv Singh's death has been told by the famous writer of 'vansh Bhaskar' that the middle son "sawai Jaisingh had poisoned his son with the help of his queen on the instigation of Ishwar Singh", but like Yadunath Sarkar Historians consider it a 'gapp' and do not accept it

" Apart from Ishwari Singh, funerals of all Jaipur kings were held in the ghatris, but "they were secretly set on fire around the palace complex

 The first ruler to begin the inscription was Ashoka, chakravarti ashok samraat bindusaar tathaa rani dharma kaa putr tha
 The tradition of Lanka mentions sixteen Pataranis and 101 sons of Bindusara

 Due to the inefficient administration of Sushim, rebellion arose in that area
 raja bindusaar ne susheem ke kehane par rajkumaar ashok ko vidroh ke daman ke liye vahaan bheja
 On hearing the news of Ashoka's arrival, the rebels ended the disturbance and the rebellion ended without any war
 haalaaki yahan par vidroh ek baar phir ashok ke shasankaal main hua tha, par is baar use balpurvak kuchal diya gaya
 This fame of Ashoka increased the risk of his brother Sushim not getting the throne
 usne samraat bindusaar ko kahkar ashok ko nirvaas main daal diya
 Ashok went to Kalinga
 vahaan use matsayakumari kaurvaki se pyaar ho gaya
 According to recent evidence, Ashoka later made her the third or second queen

 chaude gej ko broad gej yaa badi line kaha jaataa he, chote gej ko nairo gej yaa choti line kehete hai, va ek meter chaude gej ko meter gej yaa meter line kehete hai
 Where different gauges meet together, it is called a gauge break
 kuch rail trek dohare yaa tihare gej ke hote hai, jinamein teen yaa chaar patariyaan hoti hai
 More than one gauge carts can be used on these

 uskaa vivaah hastinapurnaresh shantanu se hua
 His original name was 'matsyagandha'
 vah brahma ke shaap se matsaybhav ko praapt hui "adrika" naam kii apsara ke garbh se uparichar vasu dwaara utpann ek kanya thi
 Its name was later called Satyavati
 machhlee kaa pet fadkar mallahon ne ek balak or ek kanya ko nikaala or raja ko soochna di
 The king accepted the son as a son, but due to the smell of fish from the body of the girl, the king gave it to the sailor
 pita kii seva ke liye vah yamuna main naav chalaaya karti thi
 Parashar Muni was presumed dead by Sahastrajun and was left dead
 mata satyavati ne muniraaj kii seva kii va jivan daan diya
 The Maharishi was pleased and destroyed her fishery and gave a boon to get the best smell from her body, so she became famous by the name 'gandhavati'
 uskaa naam 'yojangandha' bhi tha
 Maharishi Ved Vyas was born from him
 baad main raja shantnu se uskaa vivaah hua
 In ancient times there was a king named Sudhanwa
 ve ek din akhet ke liye van gayi
 It was only after he left that his wife became menstruated
 usne is samachar ko apni shikari pakshi ke madhyam se raja ke paas bhijwaya
 After receiving the news, Maharaj Sudhanwa took out his semen in one and gave it to the bird
 pakshi us done ko raja kii patni ke paas pahunchaane akaash main ud chalaa
 On the way, that predatory bird found another predatory bird
 donon pakshiyon main yuddh hone laga
 During the war, he got rid of both bird's claws and fell into Yamuna
 yamuna main brahma ke shaap se machhlee bani ek apsara rahati thi
 The nymph of fish swallowed semen flowing in both and due to its effect she became pregnant
 garbh purna hone par ek nishad ne us machhlee ko apane jaal main fasaa liya
 When Nishad cut the fish, a boy and a girl came out of his stomach
 nishad un shishuon ko lekar maharaj sudhanva ke paas gaya
 Due to not being the son of Maharaj Sudhanwa, he kept the child with him, named Matsyaraj
 balika nishad ke paas hi rah gai or uskaa naam matsaygandha rakhaa gaya kyonki uske angon se machhlee kii gandh nikalati thi
 That girl is also known as Satyavati
 badi hone par vah naav khene kaa kaary karne lagi
 Once Parashar Muni had to sit on his boat and cross the Yamuna
 parashar muni satyavati rup-soundarya par aasakt ho gayi or bole, "devi! main tumhaare saath sahavaas karnaa chahta hoon
 "satyavati said," Muniver! You are a theologian and i am a Nishad girl
 hamaara sahavaas sambhav nahin he
 i am a virgin mere pita kya kahenge" parashar muni bole, "balike! tum chintaa mat karo
 You will remain a virgin even after childbearing
 " parashar ne phir se maang kii to satyavati boli kii" mere sharir se machhlee kii durgandh nikalati he"
 Then while blessing him, he said, "the smell of fish coming out of your body will turn into fragrance
 " Having said this, he created a thick mist network around his yoga force so that no one else would see him in that condition
 is prakaar parashar va satyavati main pranay sambandh sthapit hua
 When the time came, Satyavati had a son from Vedas, who passed from the womb
 janm hote hi vah balak bada ho gaya or apni mata se bolaa, "mata! tu jab kabhi bhi vipatti main mujhe samaran karegi, main upasthit ho jaaungaa
 "having said this, he went to the island of Dwaipayan to do penance
 dwaipayan dweep main tapasya karne tathaa unke sharir kaa rang kaala hone ke kaaran unhe krishna dwaipayan kaha jane laga
 Later on he became famous by the name of Ved Vyas because of commenting on the Vedas
 ek baar hastinapur ke maharaj prateep ganga ke kinare tapasya kar rahe the
 Fascinated by his beauty, Goddess Ganga sat on his right thigh
 maharaj yah dekh kar aashcharya main pad gayi tab ganga ne kaha, "he rajan! main jahnu rishi kii putree ganga hoon* or aapse vivaah karne kii abhilaashaa le kar aapke paas ai hoon
 "on this Maharaja Pratip said," Gange! You are sitting on my right thigh
 patni ko to vamangi hona chaiye, dahini jaangh to putr kaa pratik he atah main tumhen apane putravadhu ke rup main sweekaar karata hoon
 "ganga went away after hearing this
 ab maharaj prateep ne putr prapti ke liye ghor tap karnaa armbh kar diya
 As a result of his tenacity, he received a son, whom he named Shantanu
 shantanu ke yuva hone par use ganga ke saath vivaah karne kaa aadesh de maharaj prateep swarg chale gayi
 To follow his father's order, Shantanu went to Ganga and requested him to marry her
 ganga boleen, "rajan! main aapke saath vivaah to kar sakati hoon kintu aapako vachan dena hoga ki aap mere kisi bhi kaary main hastkshep nahin karenge
 "shantanu got married as promised by Ganga and married him
 ganga ke garbh se maharaj shantanu ke aath putr huye jinamein se saat ko ganga ne ganga nadi main le ja kar baha diya or apane diye huye vachan main bandhe hone ke kaaran maharaj shantanu kuch bol na sake
 When Ganga had an eighth son and she also took him to the river for shed, the king did not stop with Shantanu and he said, "ganges! You shed my seven sons in the river but according to your promise i did not say anything 
 ab tum mere is aathven putr ko bhi bahaane ja rahi ho
 i pray you, please do not throw it in the river
 " yah sun kar ganga ne kaha, "rajan! aapane apni pratigya bhang kar di he isaliye ab main aapke paas nahin rah sakati
 "by saying this, Ganga became attuned to her son
