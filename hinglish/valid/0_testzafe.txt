 From around the 13th century onwards, in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, "sant Mat" was a loosely connected group of gurus that gained much fame
 dharm brahm vigyaan ke taur par unki shikshaaon kii visheshta yah he ki ve antarmukhi or prem bhakthi ke ek divine siddhant se jude hai or saamaajik rup se ve ek samtawadi gunon vaale siddhant se jude hai jo hindu dharm kii jati pratha ke viruddh he or hindu - muslim ke antar ke bhi viruddh he
 The saint tradition can be broadly divided into two groups: Punjab, the northern group of saints of the region who expressed themselves mainly in colloquial Hindi and the southern group whose language is ancient Marathi and is represented by Namdev and other saints from Maharashtra
 
 'sant mat' kaa arth he - 'santon kaa maarg', 'satya kaa maarg', 'sahi or ashaavadi path' yaa 'santon kii raay'
 'sant' shabd sanskrit kii dhaatu 'sad' se bana he or kai prakaar se prayog haa he 
 iskaa mul arth he 'satya jaanane vaala' yaa 'jisane antim satya anubhav kar liya ho
 The meaning of the word "saint" is generally taken from a good person, but its special meaning is taken only from the saint poets of medieval India
 sant mat andolan ekarup nahin tha or isamen santon kaa apana saamaajik-dharmik vyavhaar shaamil tha jo ki hajaar varsh pehle bhagavadgita main varnit bhakthi par aadhaarit tha
 He shared some of his own traditions with each other and followers of the traditions he challenged
 is prakaar sant mat vishisht dharmik parampara ke bajaay aadhyatmik vyaktitvon kaa aisa vividhtapurna samooh prathit hota he jo ek saamaanya aadhyatmik mul ko sweekaar karata he
 The boundaries of this movement were probably not sectarian and it did not even have Brahmin concepts of caste and method of worship

 The tradition of Ramanandi monks tells the story of Ramananda differently by other saints and later Sikhs
 itani jaankaree milti he ki ramanand ne sabhi jatiyon se shishy sweekaar kiye, yah ek aisa tathy he jiskaa roodhiwaadee hinduon ne us samay virodh kiya tha
 The followers of Sant Mat believe that Ramananda's disciples prepared the first generation of saints
 in santon ne ek sankruti kaa vikaas kiya jo samaaj main haashie par pade manushyon ke nikat thi jisamen mahilaayein, dalit, achhut or atishudra shaamil the
 Some of the more famous saints include Namdev, Kabir, Nanak, Surdas, Meera Bai, Tulsidas and Tukaram
 
 The tradition of saints has been non-denominational, although many saint poets are believed to have established their sects
 inamen se kaiyon ke naam ke saath sant judaa he lekin unke shishyon ne aage chal kar kabir panth, dadu panth, dariyaa panth, advait mat, aadhyatmikta kaa vigyaan or radhaswami jaise panth chalaae
 Only a minority of religious Hindus have formally followed the saintly faith
 parantu is parampara kaa sabhi sampradaayon or jatiyon par bahut prabhaav pada he
 The hymns of bygone saints like Meera Bai are widely heard in Hindu castes in India and around the world

 sant mat parampara main jinda guru ko mahatv diya jaataa he jise satguru yaa 'purna guru' jaise sammaan suchak shabdon ke saath sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 There is believed to be a lot of similarity between medieval Sufi poets such as Jalal al-din Mohammed Rumi and Sindhi poets and saintly poets
 uttar bharat kaa radhaswami andolan apane aap ko santamat panrapara or dharmik prayaas kaa mukhya nidhaan maanata he or swayan ko sant parampara ke jivit avatar kii bhaanti prastut karata he
 The most notable is the Radhaswami Satsang Beas, which is situated on the banks of the Beas River and whose current living Guru is Gurinder Singh

 Lane has described Fakir's statement of 'not knowing' as 'chandian influence' concerning the manifestation of Baba Fakir Chand's divine form

 This breaks many assumptions of saintliness

 Chandrabhanu Gupta's political career began in 1926
 He was made a member of Uttar Pradesh Congress and All India Congress Committee
 Chandrabhanu had made his mark in the Congress in a very short time as soon as he entered politics
 He immediately became the Treasurer, Vice President and President of the UP Congress
 In the election of 1937, he was elected a member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly
 Then in the first state government formed in 1946 after independence, he joined Govindballabh Pant's cabinet as Parliamentary Secretary
 He then worked as a minister of several departments from 1948 to 1959
 In 1960, he was made the Chief Minister of UP
 At that time, he was an MLA from Ranikhet South
 Politics had become very complicated when Sampurnanand was the Chief Minister
 Many factions were formed in the Congress
 In such a situation, Sampurnanand was made the Governor of Rajasthan and Chandrabhanu was the Chief Minister of UP
 Meanwhile, Gupta's stature had increased a lot in UP politics
 Becoming the Chief Minister was a landslide victory over all types of opposition
 This created panic among the leaders of the Center
 This was the period when the Congress people started challenging Nehru's power at the Center
 Chandrabhanu was not completely influenced by Nehru's socialism
 So Nehru did not like them
 But in the UP Congress, Chandrabhanu was so angry that the mlas were first bowed down in front of Chandrabhanu, and later in front of Nehru
 Nehru not like this In 1963, k Kamaraj advised Nehru that all Congress chief ministers, except a few people, should be designed
 So that state governments can be re-organized
 It was said that leave the post for a few days
 Have to work for the party
 But in Chandrabhanu's eyes, it was that all this game is happening so that the one whom Nehru does not like, he should leave
 They declined
 But they were convinced that it was a matter of a few days
 You will be made Chief Minister again
 But this did not happen
 Under the Kamaraj plan, Chandrabhanu had to step down on the dictum of ideals
 This was a very Democratic war of dictatorship over democracy
 The elected leader had to step down due to dislike
 Chandrabhanu was the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh thrice
 From 1960 to 1963
 But even after leaving the post of Chief Minister, he remained an influence in politics
 a matter of luck
 He again became the Chief Minister after winning the 1967 election
 But this time for only 19 days
 Same luck again
 Farmer leader Chaudhary Charan Singh broke the Congress and formed his party
 Chandrabhanu's government went
 Charan Singh became Chief Minister
 But they could not run the government
 That government also fell
 And Chandrabhanu Gupta was re-appointed as Chief Minister in a hurry in 1969
 He remained in this position for almost a year
 Then something happened that changed the Congress forever
 The Congress party broke up in 1969
 This was not an internal issue of UP
 This time the breakdown took place at the center level
 In a syndicate group led by Indira Gandhi and Kamaraj
 Everyone thought that Indira would be a puppet in her hands
 But Indira turned out to be the biggest politician
 There was a dispute between the two factions about the President
 Morarji Desai turned out to be a strong opponent of Indira
 Chandrabhanu Gupta went to Morarji Camp
 But this camp lost
 VV Giri became President with the support of Indira
 It was here that the career of most of the leaders of the syndicate got a break
 Chandrabhanu's career ended
 But it's a matter of time Morarji also became Prime Minister
 Chandrabhanu was offered a position in the cabinet
 But Chandrabhanu's health had deteriorated
 It was not appropriate to take the post of minister
 They declined
 He died on 11 March 1980

 isamen niyantran char ke niyantran ke liye na keval ise hi mapa jaataa he balki kisi anya char ko bhi mapa jaataa he
 The outer loop, instead of directly controlling the control variable, provides a set-point for the inner loop that ultimately controls the primary variable through the process
 sopani niyantran chunane kaa mukhya kaaran yah hota he ki isse niyantran karne main kathin tantra do bhaagon main bant jaataa he or mukhya disterbens ko gherte hue ek dwitiyak niyantran loop bana diya jaataa he
 Thus the secondary loop removes most of the disturbances, so the main loop has to control only the small disturbances
 'sheeghra soochna safalataa kaa aadhaar he' - yahi sopani niyantran kaa bhi aadhaar he
 Sopani control is most beneficial where the inner closed loop covers all the disturbances and delays of the second order so that only the 'big lag' is included in the primary loop

 Vitamins and salts are required for proper editing of body functions
 hamaara sharir ye sab vastuen aahaar se hi praapt karata he
 Yes, the chemical form of the ingredients from the diet is different from the body form
 atev aahaar ke avyavon ko sharir pachak rason dwaara unke sookshm ghatakon main vighatit kar detaa he or un ghatakon kaa phir se sanshleshan karke apane liye upyukt avyavon ko taiyaar kar letaa he
 This is done by organ cells
 jo ghatak upyogi nahin hote, unako ye chhod detii hai
 The body excretes such substances through feces, urine, sweat and breathing
 pachan kaa prayojan he aahaar ke gudh avyavon ko saadhaaran ghatakon main vibhakt kar dena
 This work is performed by lala rasa in the mouth, gastric juice in the stomach, pancreas juice and bile in the duodenum, and in the asteroid by the intestines
 in kaaryon kaa yahan sankshep main varnan kiya jaataa he : The food in the mouth is chewed by teeth and divided into microscopic particles and saliva gets mixed in it, in which there is an enzyme called tyline
 yah ras munh ke baahar sthit kapolgrathi or adhohanviny tathaa adhojihv grathiyon main banataa hai
 From these glands, especially by chewing their food, saliva juice keeps coming in the mouth
 isaki kriya kshareey hoti he
 The chemical action of its tyline enzyme is particularly on carbohydrates, which causes its starch to be converted first into dextrin and then to glucose
 saadhaaran eekh kii chini main bhi yahi parivartan hota he
 Wetting and snoring of the food grains are also the main function of Lala, so that it can be swallowed easily and the thin grass reaches the stomach through the placenta
 nigalane kii kriya mukh ke bheetar jihva kii peshiyon tathaa grasani kii peshiyon dwaara hoti he
 Due to the inhibition of the muscles of the tongue, the tongue lifts up and presses the grass placed on the palate and the tongue, which slips and goes from the pharynx backwards
 turant grasani kii peshiyaan sankoch karti hai or grass ghatidhakkan par hota hua grasanalee main chalaa jaataa he, jahaan uski bhittiyon main sthit vrittakar or anudairthay sutara apane sankoch or vistaar se utpann hui antragati dwaara usko naal ke ant tak pahunchaa dete hai
 And the grass enters the stomach through the gastritis
 amashay main pachan kii kriya jathraras dwaara hoti he
 The mucous glands of the stomach produce this juice
 jab aahaar amashay main pahunchataa he to yah ras chaaron ore kii grathiyon se amashay main aisi teevr gati se pravaahit hone lagata he jaise usko undela ja rahaa ho
 The two main components of this juice are enzymes called pepsin and hydrochloric acid
 pepsin kii vishesh kriya proteinon par hoti he, jisamen hydrochloric amla sahaayta karata he
 By this action, the protein first swells and then starts melting from outside
 is kaaran grass kaa bheetar kaa bhaag der se galata he
 This leads to the action of Lala's tiline enzyme until all the alkali of Lala is neutralized by the acidic acid of the stomach
 jathreey ras kii kriya dwaara protein se pehle metaprotein banataa he
 It then turns into a protozoase
 proteojez phir peptone main tut jate hai
 It does not change much
 jathreey ras main do or enzim bhi hote hai, jinako amiles or lypez kehete hai
 Amylase dissolves carbohydrates and lipase fats
 is main doodh ko faadanevaala ek or enzim renin bhi hota he
 It also has mild bactericidal power
 jathreey ras kaa srav mukhyatya tantrikamandal ke adheen he
 Experiments by the noted Russian scholar Pavloff of physiology have thrown much light in this regard
 unase pramanit ho chukaa he ki aahaar padaarthon kii sungadh naak se soonghane or unako netron se dekhne se ras kaa srav hone lagata he
 This is the reason that hunger begins to be known only by the smell of the making of good food items, and seeing them increases the apps
 jeebh par lagane se turant khaane kii ichha hoti he
 If the food items are not good or tasteful, then hunger dies
 aise aahaar kaa pachan bhi uttam reeti se nahin hota
 It also reduces the secretion of juice
 jathreey ras kii kriya visheshkar protein par hoti he
 The secretion of juice occurs when meat, eggs, fish, milk, etc
 reach the stomach
 namak, baraf yaa kankad aadi khaane ko die jaayen to srav nahin hoga
 These two big glands are very much related to digestion of pancreas and liver
 agnyashay main agnyashay ras banataa he
 It is a very strong digestive juice, which acts on all three components: protein, carbohydrate and fat
 iskaa nirmaan agnyashay granthi kii koshikaon dwaara hota he or saare agnyashay se ekatra hokar yah ras ek vahini dwaara grahani main pahunchataa he
 The duct that carries bile from the father's body becomes common bile duct with this pancreas
 usee ke mukh dwaara agnyashay or pitt, donon ras, grahani main pahonchte rahete hai
 The pancreatic gland is located behind the stomach in the left side of the stomach
 iskaa bada sir grahani ke mode main rahata he or uski punch bain ore pleeha tak chali gai he
 Its color is slightly beige brown
 iske sookshm bhaag shahatut ke daanon ke samaan uthe hue dikhaai padate hai
 Pancreas juice has strong action, especially on protein
 usase protein bina foole hue hi ghulne lagata he
 The action of this juice is alkaline
 is kaaran pehle kshareey metaprotein banati he
 Proteases are then formed from metaproteins
 proteos phir peptone main parivartit ho jate hai
 Finally, the breakdown of peptone creates amino acids, which are the end products of protein digestion
 amashay se proteinon ke pachan ke falswaroop jo peptone aate hai, ve bhi amino amlon main tut jate hai
 The nervous system has no control over the secretion of pancreas juice
 tantrikaon ke uttejan se ras kii utpatti kam yaa adhik nahin hoti
 The origin of the juice starts when the food digested in the stomach, which is of semi-fluid form, comes out of the stomach through the pyloric cavity and enters the duodenum
 is amlik kaainm ke sampark se grahani ko shleshmal str kii koshikaon main sicrratin naamak rasinic vastu utpann hoti he
 This item reaches the cells of the pancreas by blood and stimulates them to make juice and then the juice starts coming into the duodenum
 is ras kii duusari visheshta yah he ki yadi grahani main pahunchne se purv hi agnyashay kii nalika main is ras ko ekatra kar liya jaay, to vah niskriy rahata he
 There is no action on its protein
 jab vah grahani main aane par antric ras ke saath mil jaataa he, tabhi usamen protein vighatit karne kii prabal shakti utpann hoti he
 It is believed that an enzyme called enterokinase of intestinal juice activates it
 ye nimnlikhit hai : The upper part of the right side of the abdomen is the largest gland in the body called the liver, which produces bile
 vahaan se pitt pittashay main jaakar ekatra ho jaataa he or pachan ke samay ek vahini dwaara grahani main pahunchataa rahata he
 Can also reach the duodenum directly from the liver
 yah hare rang kaa gadha taral dravya hota he
 It helps in digestion of fat
 grahani se aahaar, jisamen uske paachit avyav hote hai, kshudantra ke pratham bhaag agrakshudrant main aa jaataa he
 At this time it is thick like honey and can flow well into the esophagus
 yahan bhi pachan kriya hoti rahati he
 Pancreatic digestion continues for some time
 kshudantra ke ras main bhi pachan shakti hoti he
 It can break down proteins, but not proteins, and peptones into amino acids
 par uski vishesh kriya depsin amoiles or lipej enzymon ko sakriy bananaa he
 Pavloff, who was the first to explore the subject, believes that all three enzymes remain in their former form before the intestinal juices were found, and are therefore inactive
 tripsin tripsinogen ke rup main rahati he
 Amylase and Lipez also live in the former state
 jab antraras agnyashayras main miltaa he, to tripsinogen se tripsin ban jaati he or shesh donon enzim bhi sakriy ho jate hai
 Pancreas juice is inactive before intestinal juice is added
 kshudantra kaa kaary visheshtya avasorana kaa he
 By looking at the picture of its internal composition, it will be known that in the mucous art inside it, which covers all the bowel from within, deep folds remain, which makes the art surface more than the bowel
 kala kii silavaton par ankur lage rahete hai
 All of these work to be absorbed
 ankuron kii sookshm rachana bhi dhyaan dene yogya he
 In the middle of each shoot, a whitetail has moved near its crest
 yah akshirvahini he
 Black lines appear on either side of it, which are the branches and cells of arteries and veins
 ye donon prakaar kii rachanaayen, vahiniyaan or dhamni tathaa shirayen, baahar yaa neeche jaakar adhoshleshmik str main badi raktavahikaaon or vahiniyon main mil jaati hai
 The fat is absorbed by the mucosa and then reaches the aneurysm and finally gets into the blood
 glucose or protein kaa avasorana hokar ve raktakeshikaon dwaara rakt main pahunch jate hai
 Blood carries these three components to the cells of each organ of the body and nourishes them
 20-22 foot lambii kshudantra kii nalee kaa yahi vishesh kaary he
 The function of the colon is absorption only
 yah ang visheshtya jal kaa avasorana karata he
 At the time of excretion, the form of excreta, which forms in the excreta, forms at the end of the colon and rectum
 24 ghante main brihadantra jal kaa avasorana kar letaa he
 Apart from water, it also absorbs some glucose, but does not absorb any other substance
 iske atirikt loh, magnesium, calosium aadi sharir kaa tyaag brihadantra hi main karte hai
 Here they are excreted and mixed in feces
 jeevanuon kii kriya se bhi pachan main sahaayta milti he
 In the gastrointestinal tract, they break down protein, fat and starch etc
 brihadantra main ve celulose kaa bhi, jisapar kisi pachak ras kii kriya nahin hoti, bhanjan kar daalate hai
 Due to this, gases like hydrogen sulfide, methane etc
 are produced and fat is formed from the breakdown of fat, due to which the action of feces becomes acidic
 yah gati saare pachak naal main, grasanal se lekar malashay tak, hoti rahati he, jisase khaaya hua yaa paachit aahaar nirantar agrasar hota jaataa he
 This motion occurs in other means and also in vessels
 antranal main shleshmal str ke baahar vrittakar or unke baahar anudairdhya peshisutron ke str sthit hai
 The width of the placenta is narrowed by the inhibition of circular formulas
 atev sankoch se aage ke aahaar kaa bhaag peeche ko nahin laut saktaa
 That is why longitudinal formulas shrink and reduce the length of that part of the placenta
 atev aahaar aage ko bad jaataa he
 Then he moves further with similar action in the front section
 yahi antragati kehalaati he
 The second Khandibhavan motion also occurs in the placenta wall
 ye gatiyaan aahaar ko aage badhaane main sahaayta dene ke atirikt, bhalee prakaar se kim ko math sa detii hai, jisase pachak ras or aahaar ke kanon kaa ghanishtha sampark ho jaataa he
 From the description of the action of different digestive juices, it is clear that nature has made such a arrangement that all the components of the dietary substances, which are present in the animal body also, do not go in vain
 unka jitna bhi adhik se adhik ho sake, sharir main upyog ho
 They can create broken parts of the body, also create new tissues and generate energy to work
 aahaar kaa yahi prayojan he or aahaar ke bhinn avyavon kaa unke atyant sookshm tatwon main vibhanjan kar dena, jisase unka avasorana ho jaay or sharir kii koshikaaye unase apni aavashyak vastuen taiyaar kar len, yahi pachan kaa prayojan he
 In fact, in what is commonly called digestion, the sense of two actions is hidden, digestion and absorption
 pachan keval aahaar ke avyavon kaa apane ghatakon main tut janaa he, jo pachak rason kii kriya kaa fal hota he
