 Analysis of variance in statistics is a collection of statistical models, in which observed variance is divided into several parts due to explanatory variables
 apane saralatam rup main anova is chiz kaa sankhyikee pareekshan karata he ki kya kai samoohon kaa madhya baraabar hota he or is tarah se ye students tu sample tii test yaa pareekshanon ko do se adhik samooh ke liye samanyikrut kar detaa he
 Thus the three retention classes of models are as follows: vyavhaar main, kai prakaar ke anova maujuud hai jo prabandhon kii sankhya or prayog ke vishay par lagu kiye gaye tareekon par nirbhar karata he
 The real-effects model of variance analysis is applicable in situations in which the user applies several arrangements to the subject of the experiment to see how the change in the value of the variables affects it
 This allows the user to estimate the extent of the effect on the total population due to changes in the value of the variables by different arrangements
 kram-rahit prabhaav model kaa upyog tab kiya jaataa he jab prabandh tay nahin hote
 aisa tab hota he jab vibhinn prabandh kaaphi badi jansankhya ke namoonay ke taur par liye gaye hote hai
 Because the arrangements themselves are random variables, some assumptions and methods that represent the arrangements are different from ANOVA Model 1
 ek saath milakar ye ek aam dharna banaate hai ki achal prabhaav model ke liye trutiyaa mukt rup se, samaan rup se or saamaanya rup se vitarit hoti hai yaa: ]
 epa pareekshan kul vichlan ke gunakon main tulana ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 For example, in a pathological, or single multiplier ANOVA, statistical significance is known by comparison of the statistic of the f test
 jahaan: And epa - vitaran par jab I-1, swatantraaa kii ghaat nt-i fif vitaran kaa prayog prakritik he kyonki shai-varg vitaran vaale virgon ke yoga ke do maadhyon kaa bhagfal hi parikshan kaa sankhyikeey he
 As Conover and Eman suggested for the first time in 1981, in many cases, when the data do not conform to the anova's assumptions, each true statistical value can be replaced by its rank where the statistic transformed into the smallest for the statistic
 a value of n can be given for 1 and at most
 "jahaan koi samakaksh aprachaalik paddati viksit nahin gai he jaise ki dwipatheey dizin hetu, arupantarit anova kii tulana main darjon kaa roopantaran aise pareekshan ke rup main saamne aata he jo gaiyr saamanyata ke liye zyada pusht hote hai or bahirvasi or aniyat parivartanshiltaa ke prati zyada pratirodhi hote hai
 "
 But Seaman et al
 Observed that the status change given by Conover and Iman is not appropriate for testing interactions between effects of factorial designs because it may increase the Type i error further
 iske alaava, agar donon mukhya gunak mahatvapurn hote hai to antah kriya kaa pataa lagane kii shakti bahut kam ho jaati he
 a variant-change of rank ranks another change in 'quantile normal' such that the resulting values have some defined distribution with a specified mean and variance
 Further analysis of quantile-normalized data is such that the distribution can be assumed to compute significance values
 anova ke sandarbh main hi prabhaav ke kai maanak maapan prayog kiye jate hai jinke zariye bhavishyavaktaa yaa unke samooh or nirbhar charon ke bich sambandh kii degree kaa varnan kiya jaataa he
 Effect size estimates are given to researchers so that they can compare the results of the study in each branch
 Common effect size estimates reported in binary and multivariate statistical analysis include the Eeta-squared, the partial Eta-squared, the Omega, and the interrelationship
 2 η : ita-varg anya purv vaadiyon par niyantran rakhte hue nirbhar char main purv vaadi dwaara varnit bhinnata ke anupaat ko bataata he
 Eta squared is a biased estimator of the variance or variability described by the model in population
 On average, it overestimates the variation in population

 anova main ek mahatvapurn prabhaav aksar ke saath aata he ek yaa ek se alag anuvarthi pareekshan adhik he
 The statistically significant effect in ANOVA is often rechecked with one or more following tests
 aisa ye akalan karne ke liye kiya jaataa he ki koun se samooh anya samoohon se alag hai yaa phir anya kai kendrit pariklpanaaon ko jaanchane ke liye bhi
anugami pareekshan aksar is aadhaar par pahachaane jate hai ki wo purvaniyojit hai yaa post hok yaa baad main tay kiye gaye
 Preplanned tests are done before viewing the data and post hoc or after thought tests are done after viewing the data
 post hok pareekshan jaise ki tuki pareekshansbase aam taur par har samooh ke maadhyon kii tulana karata he or isamen tip i truti ko niyantrit karne ke kuch tareeke shaamil hote hai
 Comparisons, which are most commonly pre-planned, can be simple or complex
 saral tulana main ek samooh ke madhya kii tulana dusre samooh ke madhya se ki jaati he
 Complex comparisons usually compare two sets of groups where a set consists of two or more groups
 Tests of trends can also be seen by comparison, such as linear and quadratic relationships, while the independent variables also include some consecutive levels

 Strength analysis can help in study design by determining the size of the sample required to solve the null hypothesis
 pehle prayog main, samooh ek ko vodaka, samooh bi ko jin si ko ek plasebo di gayi he
 All groups are then tested for a memory task
 vibhinn prabandhon kaa prabhaav jaanane ke liye ek pathiya anova kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 In another experiment, group a was given vodka and tested in a memory task
 usee samooh ko paanch din kaa avkaash dekar unhen phir jin dekar vahi pariksha dobaaraa lee gai
 The same process is repeated for placebo
 punrarit maapan hetu ekapathy anova kaa prayog vodaka or plasebo ke prabhaav kii tulana karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 In the third test to find out the effect of expectations, subjects are divided into four random groups
 iske baad prayek samooh kaa ek smriti kaary par pareekshan kiya jaataa he
 The benefits of this design are that multiple variables can be tested at the same time instead of being tested separately
 saath hi, prayog ye nirdhaarit kar sakate hai ki kya ek char anya char ko prabhavit karata he 
 ek kram gunak anova is baat ke prabhaav kaa akalan kar saktaa he ki vodaka yaa plasebo donon kii apeksha or vastav main unke milane par kya hota he

 Velupillai Prabhakaran was the leader of the LTTE
 1975 ke aasapaas littey ke gathan ke baad se wo duniya ke sabase taqatvar gorilla ladaakaon ke pramukh ke rup main janaa jaataa tha
 On 18 May 2009, the Sri Lankan army claimed to have killed him
 prabhakaran kaa janm 26 navambar 1954 ko srilanka ke jafana dweep ke samudratati nagar velvettithurai main hua tha
 He was the fourth and youngest child of his parents
 prabhakaran padhai main ausat darje kaa tha
 As a child, she was shy and clinging to books
 srilanka main pruthak ilam kii maang ko lekar pichley teen dashak tak nirmam andolan chalaane vaala velupillai prabhakaran ek pakkaa ladaaka tha, lekin uske virdohi use ek aise mahatvakankshi ke rup main dekhte the jisane asantushton ko kabhi sahan nahin kiya
 Prabhakaran, notorious as 'thambi', was the fourth child of a government official who left school as a child
 prabhakaran, nepolian va sinkadar mahaan se bahut prabhavit tha or usne unki kai kitabon ko padhaa tha
 This was revealed by Prabhakaran in an interview
 inke alaava prabhakaran subhash chandra bose or bhagat singh se bhi bahut prabhavit tha
 Both these Indian leaders believed in violent struggle against British rule
 raajnneeti, rojgaar or shiksha main tamilon ke saath bhed-bhav se aahat prabhakaran ne raajnneetik baithkon main bhaag lenaa shuru kiya or marshall art kaa prashikshan praapt kiya
 
 shri lanka main tamil hindu jo ki alpsankhyakah he or isai bahusankhyak rahete hai
 Till date, Tamil Hindus have not got the right to vote in Sri Lanka
 yahan tak ki shri lanka ke savidhan main saafe taur par likhaa he ki tamil hindu duusare darje ke naagarik he
 If we start telling cow atrocities on Tamil Hindus, then our page will be closed at this time
 aap kalpana kijiye kitna bhayanak rup se tamilo kaa katleam kiya gaya hoga
 In protest against this atrocity, Valipilai Prabhakaran created the LTTE {liberson Tiger of Tamil Ilm}
 hindu tamilo ke saamne sirf do hi raste batch gay the, ek isaayiyo ke atyaachaaro kaa shikaar banakar bujdil ki maut maro or dusraa rasta swabhimaan ke khatir ladate hue maut ko gale laga lo
 The Hindu Tamils chose another route and waged war with Sri Lanka, supporting Prabhakaran
 shruwati dashako main littey ko jabardast kamyaabi mili or aanshik rup se shri lanka haar tak maan lee thi
 That is when our very ex-prime Minister Shri Rajiv Gandhi intervenes and helps Sri Lanka army, yes he heard right, India helps the Christians and waging war against Prabhakaran
 jiske jawaab main prabhakaran, rajeev gandhi ki hatya karvaa dete hai
 If Prabhakaran had been given a little support at that time, then Hindu Tamils would have had a different country and would not have to live with Sri Lanka
 kyunki tab tamilo kaa desh hamaare saath khadaa hota
 Even today the situation of Tamil Hindus in Sri Lanka is pathetic
 srilanka ke purvottar kshetra main ek chote se kasbe main thambi kaa udai hua or tamilon ke liye alag 'grihabhumi' kii maang ko puraa karne ke liye usne 1972 main kuch yuvakon ke ek samooh ke saath 'tamil new tiger' kii shuruyaat kii
 He led this group
 1975 main is samooh kaa naam badal kar libration tigers of tamil ilam rakh diya gaya
 The group became more aggressive after the infamous Vellikade prison massacre
 is narsanhaar main algaavvaadi netaa kuttamani or jagan ko sena ne maar diya tha
 Under Prabhakaran's leadership, the world first became aware of the suicide squad, which was also victimized by former Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi
 prabhakaran kii pahchaan ek nirbhik chhapamar ladaake ke rup main thi
 Always equipped with realities and uniforms, Prabhakaran soon emerged as an inspiration to the Tamil rebels
 samarthakon ke liye swatantraaa senaanee tathaa anya logon ke liye durdaat ladaake ke rup main kukhyat prabhakaran aatankwaad, hatya or sangathit aparaadh ke liye 1990 se interpol or anya sanghathanon ko vaanchit tha
 Prabhakaran preferred to be on the battlefield rather than talking at the negotiating table, so when Norwegian mediation broke out in 2002, Prabhakaran used it to organize the LTTE
 parantu sangharsh viraam tikaoo sabit nahin hua or varsh 2003 se varsh 2008 ke bich prabhakaran ko kai jatke lage
 In 2004, Colonel Karuna, once considered Prabhakaran's right hand man, split from him
 do varsh baad altitii kii raajnneetik shakha ke pramukh anton balasingham kii landan main mrityu ho gai
 Balasingham was suffering from cancer
 november 2007 main sena kii bambaari main varisht tamil vidrohi netaa espi tamilchelvam maaraa gaya
 Prabhakaran, who was fighting against the majority Sinhalese regime, was considered a Tamil, freedom fighter, on the other hand, the Sri Lankan government and army considered him a cruel assassin, for whom human life had no value
 varsh 1975 main un par jafana ke meyar kii hatya kaa aarope laga
 This was the first major action by the Tamil rebels
 tamil ilam ke sangharsh main anek sinhalai or tamil netaaon samet 70 hajaar se adhik logon ne praan ganvaae gai
 Former Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi also succumbed to this terrorism
 prabhakaran sinhalai netaaon raashtrapati premadas, damini dishanayake or ranjan vijayratne tathaa udaaravaadi tamil netaaon appapillai, amirtalingam, yogeshwaran or unki patni tathaa videsh mantri lakshaman kaadirgamar kii hatya kaa uttaradaayi tha

 Mekiavellianism, according to the Oksvord English Dictionary, means "to be clever and deceitful in the state of art or in general conduct"
 yah italvi rajanyik nicolo mekiveli ke prasiddh kitaab "da prince" ke madhyam se praapt hua he
 The term is also used similarly in modern psychology, where it describes dark triad celebrities
 jo visheshta se nandak vishwaason or vyaavhaarik naitikta ke saath jude ek duplicitous parsparik style he
 "machiavellianism" as a term was first published in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1626
 nicolo mekiveli ek italvi raajnneetijna or darshanik jo apne vakaalat "raajnneetik naitikta jo prabhaavasheel he vah naitikta se zyaada mahatvapurn he" ke liye prasiddh he
 The source of this phrase he considered "justifies the end of the medium"

 In this book he elaborates on the correlation between manipulation, control and personal gain
 unka yah maananaa tha kii agar vyakti ko pyaar kiya janaa yaa ashanka jataai jane ke bich main se ek vikalp chunanaa ho, tho use ashanka jataai janaa chunanaa chahie

 "high Mex" is one that can manipulate, convince others easily
 ve apane lakshya tak pahunchne me safal hote he or ve zyaadaatar maamalon main apni ichha anusaar jitate bhi he

 In jobs where the achievement of the target is more important, such as the proposal of the Commission for sales or results, people of high-make personality are proved to be justified in such jobs
 "lo mek" log, mek spectrum ke vipareet paksh main hai or behad vinamr hone ke rup main varnit kiye jate he
 Those individuals with a "low make" orientation are prepared to accept the direction imposed on them and succeed in highly structured situations
 lo mek log shakti, sthiti, paisa or pratispardhaa se kam prerit hai
 Winning is not everything for people

 Maciavellianism can be positive and negative in an organization depending on its use

 When maciavellianism is used for personal gain at the expense of subordinates, it is considered highly negative
 "mekivelionism" ek aisa shabd bhi he jise saamaajik or vyaktitv manovaigyanik ek vyakti ke hona, jo use paramparaagat naitikta se khud ko alag karnaa or dusro ko dhokhaa dena or herpher karne main use sakasham banaata he

 richard christy or florence jisane mekiaveli ke lekhan se bayano ko ikattha kiya or anya logon se poocha kii ve kitna ek duusare ke saath sahamat he
 And finally came to the conclusion that "maciavellianism" exists as a distinct personality trait
 unhone iskaa prakashan 1970 main kiya or tab se yah ek lokapriy vyatitv madhyam ban chukaa he
 His make four, twenty statement has become a standard soul assessment tool in personality surveying
 is paimaane kaa upyog karte hi christy or jisane vibhinn prayogtmak pareekshan kiya jisase pataa chalaa ki parasparik kaushal or "hai mek" or "lo mek" ke vyavhaar alag-alag hote he

 a 1992 review on Maciavellianism relates Maciavellian inspiration to cold selfishness and pure means
 prerana ke vishay par haal hi main kiye gaye shodh main yah bataaya gaya he ki "hai mek" or "lo mek" kii tulana me, "hai mek" log paisa, adhikaar, pratispardhaa ko ucch praathmikta or saamaajik nirmaan, swa-pyaar, paariwarik sambandho ko kam praathmikta dete he
 The "high Make" people also acknowledged that they focus only on continued success and winning at all costs
 parasparik kaushal main apane herpher ke kaaran aksar yah dharna kii jaati he ki "hai mek" log zyaada budhimaan or duusare logon ke saamaajik paristhitiyon ko behatar samajhane kii kshamta rakhte he
 However, research has established that Maciavelliaism is unrelated to intelligence
 iske alaava, bhaavnaatmak budhimatta par adhyayan ne yah bhi sthapit kiya he ki mekiavelionism bhaavnaatmak khufia ke saath judaa hua hota he
 It is rated by both performance and questionnaires
 sahanbhuti or bhaavnaatmak pahachaano kaa sambandh mekiawelianism se nakaaratmak hi he
 Along with this, Anusandan has also shown that Maciavellianism is unrelated to the advanced theory of mind
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki, log vibhin sthitiyon main kya soch rahe hai yah jaanane kii kshamta makiyavelionism se asambandhit he
 The three dark troths of Machiavellianism, ego and psychiatric personality traits are called

 Shringa is a Hindi word
 damayanti beshra santali bhashaa ke vikhyath sahityakar hai
 In 2009, he was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award for a poem collection composed by him
 plate vivartaniki ek vaigyanik siddhanth he jo prithvi ke sthalmandal main bade paimaane par hone vaali gatiyon kii vyakhya prastut karata he
 It also attempts to explain the construction of surface relief in the form of continents, oceans and mountains, and the geographical distribution of events such as earthquakes and volcanoes
 yah siddhanth beesvin shatabdi ke pratham dashak main abhikalpit mahadwipiya visthaapan naamak sankalpana se viksit hua jab 1960 ke dashak main aise naveen saakshyon kii khoj hui jinase mahadwipon ke sthir hone kii bajaay gatisheel hone kii avadharana ko bal mila
 The most important of these evidences is the evidence related to pauperism which confirmed the Sagar Nital diffusion
 harry hes ke dwaara sagar nital prasaran kii khoj se is siddhanth kaa pratipaadan aarambh mana jaataa he or wilson, morgan, maikenzi, oliver, parker ityadi vidwaanon ne iske paksh main pramaan uplabdh karaate hue iske sanvardhan main yogadan kiya
 According to this theory, the upper layer of the earth, about 80 to 100 km thick, which is called Sthalmandal, and which includes the earth's crust and the upper part of the earth's crust, is broken into several pieces called plates
 ye platen neeche sthit asthenosphere kii ardhapighalit parat par tair raheen hai or saamanyatya lagbhag 10-40 mimi / varsh kii gati se gatisheel hai haalaanki inamen kuch kii gati 160 mimi / varsh bhi he
 The movement of these plates presents an explanation of the origin and mountain formation of the earth's present surface pattern and it has been observed that often earthquakes fall on the boundaries of these plates and volcanoes are also found along these plate boundaries
 
 plate vivartaniki main vivartaniki shabd unani bhashaa ke τεκτονικός se bana he jiskaa arth nirmaan se sambandhit he
 The term plate was first used by Canadian geologist Wilson and the term plate tectonics was first used by Morgan
 is siddhant ke anusaar prithvi kii upree parat ke rup main sthit sthalmandal, jisamen crust or upree mantal kaa kuch hissaa shaamil he, kai tukdon main vibhajit he jinhen plate kaha jaataa he
 Generally, the number of large plates in these plates is considered seven
 iske alaava kuch majhale or chote aakaar kii plates bhi hai
 a list of these is given below: kuch vidwaan uttari america plate or dakshini america plate ko ek hi maanate hue badi platon kii sankhya chah manaate hai
 There are many variations in the number of small plates, but their number is generally accepted more than 100

 That is, some people believed that the size of the Earth was reduced by contraction after the origin and as a result of this contraction the forces on the surface of the earth are located and the twists are located in the form of mountains
 europe main sarvapratham austrian edward swess ne is tarah kii sankalpana ko prachaarit kiya tha
 On the contrary, some believed that the continents have moved horizontally and due to the collision, the force in the upper surface has created mountains

 It was only in the early sixteenth century that scholars marked the similarity of the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean to each other
 angrez darshanik francis bekan ne pehali baar sateek nakshon ke adhyayan se yah samanta chihnit kii, maanchitr vigyaani abraham ortalius ne 1596 main pehali baar yah kaha ki america europe or africa se tut kar alag hue hai or german dharamshastri theodor lilonethal ne 1756 main ortalius ke kathan kii pushti bible ke ek kathan ke aadhaar par karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Later American geographer FB Taylor spoke of a kind of flow of continents by the gravitational force of the moon in 1908–10, and also attributed it to the origin of the Tertiary era mountains
 par unki baat par kisi ne bahut dhyaan nahin diya
 Wagner, who was an archaeologist and archaeologist, proposed the idea that the distribution of climate in ancient times could be interpreted if the continents were to be considered dynamic and he proposed the theory of continental displacement in 1912 which His book, published in 1915, was published in Origins of Continents and Oceans
 wagonar ne hi sabase pehle "mahadwipiya visthaapan" shabd kaa prayog kiyawagonar ke isi siddhanth se aage chalakar plate vivartaniki kaa vikaas sambhav ho paaya haalaanki lagbhag aadhi sadi tak unke vichaaron ko bhi vidwaanon dwaara nakaara jaataa rahaa jab tak 1960 ke dashak main pramaan nahin uplabdh hue
 And continental displacement platon kii gatishiltaa ke kaaran inke ke kinare yaa simaayen teen prakaar ke paae jate hai: With this type of edge, the two plates move towards each other and collide them and the heavy plate is injected under the light plate
 mudakar neeche kii ore kshepit hone vaala yah hissaa gaharaai main ja kar taap or daab kii adhikta ke kaaran pighalkar megma main parivartit hota he
 The depth at which this event occurs is known as the tiller zone or Benioff zone

 jahaan do platen ek duusare ke vipareet gatisheel hoti hai, arthath ek duusare se dur hatati hai vahaan neeche se megma upar uthakar nayi plate kaa nirmaan karata he
 The most prominent landforms found on these banks are the Central Oceanic Ridge
 jab yah kinaaraa kisi mahadweep par sthit hota he to rift ghaatiyon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Due to the construction of new plate, it is also called creative edge
 sangrakshi kinaaraa vah he jiske sahare do plate ek duusare ko ragadate hue gatisheel hon, arthath na to apsaran ho rahaa ho na hi abhisaran
 Normally, rubbing each other using this edge moves in opposite directions, but it is not mandatory, if two plates move in the same direction and their motion is different, they can still form a protective edge by rubbing their edges
 inke sahare transform bhransh paae jate hai
 Since neither the plate nor the destruction is formed, they are called protective / protective edges where the status quo is preserved in the context of construction / destruction
 plate vivartaniki siddhant valit parvaton ke nirmaan kii sabase nayi vyakhya prastut karata he
 For example, a description of the origin of the mountains of the Alpine mountain system can be presented
 is siddhant ke anusaar yah mana jaataa he ki bumadhya sagar ke uttari or dakshini ore bane parvaton kii shrunkhlaayen tershiri yug main hue vivartanik ghatnaon kaa parinaam hai jinamein tethes sagar main jamaa avsaadon ke africa or europea platon ke bich sampeden dwaara inkaa nirmaan hua
 Regarding the origin of the Himalayas, this theory holds that the origin of this range is due to the approaching of the Tibet Plate and the Indian Plate and the compression of sediments deposited in the Tethys Sagar or Bhusannati

 But due to its high impedance state, these devices are used to send data from various devices on the data bus
 jo yukti bas ko data bhej rahi hoti he, usko chhodkar us bas se judi anya sabhi yuktiyon ko 'hai impidence state' main kar diya jaataa he
 Thus, these other devices are also different from being connected to the bus in a way because 'high impedance' exists between the bus and its output
 tarksangat dwaar do prakaar ke hote hai - sangyojan tark tathaa anukramik tark
 The output of a combinational logic depends only on the current state of its inputs and not on their earlier state or stages

 Any other logic gate can be used using only NOR or only NAND
 isaliye in logic dwaaron ko 'universal logic get' kehete hai
 It is not possible to create any logic function as desired using only AND, or only OR, or only NOT gates
 isaliye AND, OR or NOT get 'universal logic get' nahin hai

 This disease can occur from birth, or after some diseases
 saadhaaran vyakti rang ke halakepan yaa gaharepan kaa bhalee bhanti bodh kar saktaa he
 But in this disease, the person's sense of deepness of color or the power to recognize colors is lost
 varnakram ke ek rang athwa rangon ke mishran ke bodh ke lop hone ke aadhaar par rog ke pruthak-pruthak varg tathaa unke naam bhi hai
 Equally colored perception in humans comes from the principle of trinity
 is siddhant ke anusaar rang kaa bodh teen rangon ke vividh mishran se hota hai
 These three are pure and main colors: red, green and blue; Whose different colors are made by mixing different amounts, and these distinct colors have special perception by sight
 yah trivarnataa purushon main praaia: 92 pratishat tathaa striyon main 99

 In medical science, inflammatory bowel disease) is a group of inflammatory conditions of the colon and small intestine
 ibidi ke pramukh prakaar hai krohan rog or vranmay brihadantrashoth
 The main forms of IBD are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
 gananaa ke liye bahut kam maamalon vaale ibidi ke rup, jo hameshaa vishisht ibidi ke rup main vargeekrut nahin hote, ye hai: The main difference between Crohn's disease and UC is the location and nature of inflammatory changes
 krohan rog jatharantraparak maarg ke kisi bhi bhaag ko prabhavit kar saktaa he, mukh se guda tak, haalanki adhiktar maamle seemaant sheshantra se aarambh hote hai
 In contrast, ulcerative colitis remains in the colon and rectum
 saanchaa:pathophysiology in CD vs
 ucawi sookshm rupamen vranmay brihadantrashoth shleshmakala tak samit rahata he, jabaki krohan rog puri aant kii diwaar ko prabhavit karata he
 Finally, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis present polycystic manifestations in various proportions
 shaayad hi kabhi, prastuti main swabhaavgat vilakshantaa ke kaaran na to krohan rog or na hi vranmay brihadantrashoth kaa nishchit nidaan ho paata he
 In this case, indeterminate colitis can be diagnosed
 haalanki yah manyata praapt paribhaasha he, sabhi kendra ise nahin maanate
 Template: Symptoms in CD vs
 UC haalanki bahut alag rog hai, donon nimnlikhit main se koi bhi lakshan prastut kar sakate hai: pet dard, ulti, dast, guda se raktasrav, vajan ghatana or vibhinn sambandhit shikaayatein yaa gathiya, kothmay tvakpuyata or praathmik kaathinyakar pittavahinishoth jaise rog

 ucpraxahaka antra rog kaa ishtatam upachaar is baat par nirbhar karata he ki iskaa rup kya he
 For example, mesalazine is more useful in ulcerative colitis than Crohn's disease
 aam taur par, gambhirtha ke str ke aadhaar par, ibidi main lakshanon ko niyantrit karne ke liye pratirakshadaman kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he, jaise prednison, tnef nirodh, ajathyoprin, mithotroxet yaa 6-marceptopureen
 adhik saamanytah, ibidi ke upachaar main mesalajin ke rup kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Steroids are often used to control the spread of the disease, which was once accepted as a maintenance drug
 anek varshon se krohan rog ke marijon main prayukt jaivikon, jaise tnef nirodhakon kaa upyog haal main vrunamay brihadantrashoth ke marijon hua he
 In severe cases, surgery may be required, such as bowel resection, retraction, or a temporary or permanent colon hysterectomy or ileostomy
 Alternative medicine for intestinal diseases has treatments available in many forms, but such methods focus on the control of underlying pathologies so that steroids are not exposed to or prolonged surgical treatment
 aamtaur par ucch pradahrodhi prabhaav vaali dawaaen, jaise prednison dekar upachaar aarambh kiya jaataa he
 Once the inflammation is successfully controlled, the patient is usually transferred to mild medications, such as Asacol, a mesalamine, for improvement
 yadi asafal rahete hai to rogi ke aadhaar par, ek mesalamin ke saath uparyukt pratirakshadaman dawaaon kaa ek sangyojan diya yaa nahin diya ja saktaa he
 The toxins are produced by the histoplasmus, which causes an intestinal disease called histoplasmosis, which is a serious concern for an immunodeficient patient with symptoms of IBD
 dast, vajan kam hona, bukhaar or petdard jaise samaan lakshanon vaale ibidi rogon, jaise krohan rog or vranmay brihadantrashoth ke upachaar ke liye fungsrodhi dawaaon, jaise naystatin or yaa to itraconajol yaa flukeonajol kaa suzav diya gaya he
 The following treatment strategies have not been regularized, but appear promising in most forms of inflammatory bowel diseases
 praarambhik report kaa sujhaati hai ki "kriminissarak chikitsa" ibidi ko na keval roak sakati he balki thik bhi kar detii haih kashakrimi suis krimi ke lagbhag 2,500 dimbon ko ek maheene main do baar pilaane se kai rogiyon main spasht rup se lakshan kam hue hai
 It has also been hypothesized that an effective "immunization" process can be developed by ingesting cocktails at an early age
 purvajaiviki or praajiviki ibidi ke upachaar main vruddhijanak aashaa dikhaa rahe hai or kuch adhyayanon main siddh hua he ki ye nuskho dwaara nirdhaarit dawaaon jitani hi prabhavi hai
 In 2005 New Scientist published a joint study on the visual therapeutic power of cannabis at the University of Bristol Bristol and the University of Bath at IBD
 is report ne ki bhaang se ibidi ke lakshan kam hote hai, antra astr main cannabinoid abhigrahakon, jo jo vanaspati-janit rasayanon ke anuon ke prati pratikriya dikhaate hai, kii upasthiti kii sambhaavna kaa sanket diya he
 CB1 cannabinoid receptors - known to be present in the brain - are clad in the lining of the intestinal lining, thought to be involved in the repair of the intestinal lining when damaged
 dal ne aanton ke astr main pradaah utpann karne ke liye jaanboojh kar koshikaon ko nasht kiya or tab sanshleshit kaenabinoid diya gaya; parinaam yah hua ki astr kii sujan thik hone lagiah tuuti hui koshikaon kii marammat ho gai or daraaron ko bharne ke liye waapas paas-paas aa gayi
 yah mana jaataa he ki ek swasth pet main, ghayal hone par prakritik antarjaat kaenabinoid antatstar koshikaon se mukt hote hai or tab ve sibi1 abhigrahakon se baddh ho jate hai
 This process appears to initiate a healing process and when people use cannabis, similarly, the cannabinoids bind to these receptors
 pichley adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki sibi1 pet main tantrika koshikaon par sthit abhigraahak aanton kii gatishiltaa ko dhimaa karke kaenabinoid ke prati pratikriya karte hai, is prakaar dast ke saath jude dardanaak mansapeshi sankuchan ko kam karte hai
 The team also discovered other cannaniboid CB2 in the intestines of IBD victims, which are not present in healthy sources
 These receptors that also react to cannabis chemicals also appear to be associated with apoptosis - programmed cell death - and may also have a role in suppressing the immune system and reducing inflammation by eliminating excess cells
 jabaki dard, ulti, dast or anya saamaajik rup se asweekaarya lakshanon ke kaaran ibidi jivan kii gunvattta ko simit kar sakate hai, ye apane aap main shaayad hi kabhi ghaatak hote hai
 Fatal results due to complications such as toxic megacolon, entrapment and surgical complications are rare
 saanchaa:complications of CD vs
 UC While patients with IBD are at increased risk of colon-cancer, it is usually caught up much earlier in the colon monitoring routine by the colon than the general population, and therefore patients have more survival
 There is a possibility
 nayaa saboot sujhaate hai ki ibidi vaale rogiyon ko antatstar dushkriya or chakree dhamni rog kaa ucch jokhim rahata he
 The goal of treatment is to achieve reduction, after which the patient is usually transferred to a milder drug with fewer potential side effects
 har sambhav he ki, mul lakshanon kaa ek teevr punarutthan dikhaai de saktaa he, yah ek "flair-ap' ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Depending on the circumstances, it may go away on its own or may require medication
