 According to astrology, there are three kinds of beliefs of Saturn's Saadhesati, firstly, secondly by Chandra Lagan or Zodiac and third by Sun Lagna, in North India, the calculation of Saturn's half-sati by Chandra Lagana has been in practice since ancient times
 
 is manyata ke anusaar jab shanidev chandra raashi par gochar se apana bhraman karte hai to sadhesati maani jaati he, iskaa prabhaav raashi main aane ke tees maah pehle se or tees maah baad tak anubhav hota he
 During Sadesati, Saturn takes account of the deeds done by the native in the same way as the owner asks for the account after some time after giving full responsibility to the servant of a house, and in the case of mistake or mistake Punishment is given to the servant, similarly Shani Dev also punishes every creature
 or yahi nahi jin logon ne achche karm kiye hote hai to unako sadheshaati puraskaar bhi pradaan karti he, jaise nagar yaa gram kaa yaa shahar kaa mukhiya bana diya janaa aadi
shani kii sadhesati ke aakhyaan anek logon ke praapt hote hai, jaise raja vikramaditya, raja nal, raja harishchandr, shani kii sadhesati sant mahatmaon ko bhi pratadit karti he, jo jog ke saath bhoga ko apnaane lagate hai
 Every person must have a Sadesati once in thirty years, if this half-and-half is in Sagittarius, Pisces, Capricorn, Aquarius, it is less painful, if it will be in the fourth, sixth, eighth, and twelfth house, So the person will be unhappy, and all the happiness will be physical, mental, and economic
 They should never forget the "sapphire" in these Sadesati, if done, there is a possibility of loss of profit
 koi nayaa kaam, nayaa udyog, bhul kar bhi sadhesati main nahi karnaa chaiye, kisi bhi kaam ko karne se pehle kisi jaankaar jyotishi se jaankaree avashya kar leni chaiye
yahaan tak ki vaahan ko bhi bhuulakar is samay main nahi khareednaa chaiye, anyathaa vah vaahan sukh kaa vaahan na hokar dukhon kaa vaahan ho jaayegaa
hamane apane pichley pachchis saal ke anubhav me dekha he ki sadhesati main kitne hi udyogpatiyon kaa bura haal ho gaya, or jo crorespati the, ve rodpati hokar ek gamche main ghoomane lage
is prakaar se yah bhi naubhav kiya ki shani jab bhi chaar, chha:, aath, baarah me vicharan karegaa, to uskaa mul dhan to nasht hoga hi, kitna hi jatan kyon na kiya jaye
or shani ke is samay kaa vichaar pehle se kar liya gaya he to dhan kii raksha ho jaati he
 If caution is not taken then only remorse remains
 at: prayek manushya ko is samay kaa shani armbh hone ke pehle hi jap tap or jo vidhaan ham aage baataayenge unako kar lenaa chaiye

shani dev ne pita kii aagyaanusaar vaisaa hi kiya, or tap karne ke baad bhagwaan shankar ke vartmaan main bhi sthit shivlinga kii sthapana kii, jo aaj bhi kaashi-vishwanath ke naam se janaa jaataa he, or karm ke kaarak shani ne apane manovanchit falon kii prapti bhagwaan shankar se kii, or grahon main sarvopari pad praapt kiya

 Although Kalidas composed the story of Rama, in this story he did not raise any one character as a hero
 unhone apni kriti ‘raghuvansh’ main puure vansh kii katha rachi, jo dilip se armbh hoti he or agnivarn par samaapt hoti he
 After the coronation of his pregnant wife posthumously after Agnivarna, this epic is celebrated

Critics have considered Kalidasa's best epic 'raghuvansh'
 aadi se ant tak isamen nipun kavi kaa vilakshan kaushal vyakt hota he
 Beginning with the austere life of Dileep and Sudakshina, this poem reveals one story of the chastity, valor, sacrifice and tenacity of the Raghuvanshi kings respectively, and the poem ends with the luxury of sensual agni and their elimination
 dilip or sudakshina kaa tap:put aacharan, vartantu ke shishy kuts or raghu kaa samvaad, indumati swayamvar, ajavilap, ram or sita kii vimaanayatra, nirvasit sita kii tejaswita, sangamavarnan, ayodhya nagari kii shoonyata aadi kaa chitra ek ke baad ek ubharta jaataa he or pathak vimugdh bana hua manoyog se unako dekhtaa jaataa he
 In spite of the aggregation of many stories, in this epic, the poet has coordinated them with each other in a way that communicates the natural flow in them
 'raghuvansh' ke anek nripatiyon kii is jyotit nakshatramala main kavi ne adikavi valmiki ke mahimashali ram ko tejaswita or garima pradaan kii he
 The vivacity of the narratives, the naturalness of the incoming passages, the melody of the style and 'raghuvansh' are unique in Sanskrit verses in terms of emotion and language

 While presenting the series of similes at the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamuna, describing their flow of mixed waters, the poet has finally adorned Shiva's body as well as her beauty and thus the beauty Removed from the border and handed it to Anant- kalidas mukhyat: komal or romantic bhaavon ke abhivyanjak kavi he
 That is why the gentle, captivating and sweet side of nature is also written in his work

 In Raghuvansh poetry, Kalidas has kept the nature of liberated men in front of the readers by making Raghuvanshi kings as instruments
 raghuvanshi raajaaon kaa sankshep main varnan jaananaa ho to raghuvansh ke keval ek shloke main uski parinti is prakaar he- ) ‘raghuvansh’ kii katha dilip or unki patni sudakshina ke rishi vashishtha ke ashram main pravesh se prarambh hoti he
 King Dilip is wealthy, talented, intelligent and powerful, as well as devout

 Dileep is asked to serve Gomata Nandini to get the blessings of procreation
 roj kii tarah nandini jangal main vichar rahi he or dilip bhi uski rakhwali ke liye saath chalate hai
 At this point, a lion wants to make Nandini his meal
 dilip apane aap ko arpit kar singh se prarthana karte hai ki unhen vah apana aahaar banaaye
 Singh accepts the prayer and swings to kill them
 is chalaang ke saath hi singh ojhal ho jaataa he
 Nandini then tells that she created this illusion to take Dilip's test
 nandini dilip kii seva se prasann hokar putr prapti kaa aashirwad detii he
 Raja Dileep and Sudakshina receive the milk of Nandini and they receive the son Ratna
 is gunwan putr kaa naam raghu rakhaa jaataa he jiske parakram ke kaaran hi is vansh ko raghuvansh ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Kalidasa has described Raghu's might in detail in his book 'raghuvansh'
 ashwamedh yajna ke ghode ko churaane par unhone indra se yuddh kiya or use chhudaakar laayaa tha
 He had donated all his wealth after completing the Vishwajit Yagya
 jab unke paas kuch bhi dhan nahin rahaa, to ek din rishiputra kuts ne aakar unase 14 crores swarna mudraaen maangi taaki ve apni guru dakshina de saken
 Raghu made up his mind to make offerings to Kubera to satisfy this Brahmin
 yah soochna paakar kuber ghabaraaya or khud hi unka khazaana bhar diya
 Raghu handed over the entire treasure to the Brahmin; But that Brahminputra accepted only 14 crore currencies
 raghu ke putr aj bhi bade parakramee hue
 He went to Vidarbha princess Indumati's swayamvara and made her his wife
 kalidas ne is swayamvar kaa sundar varnan ‘raghuvansh’ main kiya he
 Raghu, seeing Aj's coronation, handed over his throne to him and took Vanaprastha
 raghu kii tarah aj bhi ek kushal raja bane
 He loved his wife Indumati very much
 ek baar naradji prasannchitt apni veena liye akaash main vichar rahe the
 Coincidentally, one flower of her veena was broken and fell on the head of queen Indumati, who was walking in the garden, which led to her death
 raja aj indumati ke viyog main vihval ho gaye or ant main jal-samadhi le lee
 Kalidas highlighted the biographies of Dileep, Raghu and Aja in the eight cantos of 'raghuvansh'

 While Rama was returning from Lanka, Sita was shown in a floral plane showing Sita to Dandakaranya and the places in Panchavati where she had discovered Sita
 iskaa bada hi sundar evam maarmik drushtaant kalidas ne ‘raghuvansh’ ke terahaven sarg main kiya he
 This canto shows how deep the geographical information of Kalidas was
 ayodhya kii purv khyaati or vartmaan sthiti kaa varnan kush ke swapn ke madhyam se kavi ne bady kushalta se solahaven sarg main kiya he
 The last canto depicts the enjoyment of the last king Agnivarna of Raghuvansh
 raja ke dambh kii paraakaashtha yah he ki janata jab raja ke darshan ke liye aati he to agnivarn apane pair khidki ke baahar pasaar detaa he
 Disrespect of the public results in the decline of the state and thus a glorious lineage is also celebrated
 kalidas jaanate the ki ram kii katha kaa utkarsh valmiki kii ramayana se ho gaya tha or uske baad jo bhi likhaa jayega uskaa juuthan hi hoga
 That is why instead of making Rama a hero in his poetry, he presented Raghuvansh as the narrator; In which all the characters had their respective roles - depending on their character xxrep 4 
 some excellent and some bad
 raghuvansh kaa naam unke parakramee or adarsh raajaaon ke naam se hi chalata rahegaa

 spairo ke paas kai sone ke daant hai, jinamein se do dep kaa he, haalanki filmakan ke dauraan unka upyog kiya gaya tha
 After shooting The Curse of the Black Pearl, Depp forgot to remove him and decided to keep him on for the entire shoot of the sequels

 Sparrow shaves his goat in two peaks

 Depp preferred to wear the same costume where he wore a silk frock coat made of silk during the entire series and for one version he was persuaded to wear it without seals or heels in seaside scenes instead of wearing his boot 
 aadhikarik line yah he ki da kars of da blike parl kaa koi bhi poshaak bachaa nahin rah paaya tha, jisase stant drishyon ke liye kadi linen vaali shart taiyaar karne kaa ek mauqaa mil gaya
 However, one costume remains that is displayed at an exhibition of screen costumes in Worcester, England
 roj ke liye turki main spairo ke kamarband ke liye vaise hi kaarigaron kaa pataa lagaana ek bure sapane jaisaa tha
 Rose did not want to dress it up as a silkscreen because a piece worn at home realizes a perfect outfit
 spairo agali kadiyon main ek atirikt belt pahentaa he, kyonki dep ne ek nayaa bakkal pasand kiya tha jo vaastavik pis ke saath feet nahin baithta tha
 Sparrow's weapons are real 18th century pieces: his sword dates to the 1740s while his pistol dates to the 1760s

 Sparrow's magical compass also survived in the sequels, though director Gore Verbinski had a red arrow attached to the dial that became a far more prominent prop
 kyonki yah ek saamaanya compass kii tarah kaam nahin karata he, ise chalaane ke liye chumbak kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 Sparrow wears four rings, two of which belong to Depp

 The other two are the props for which Depp recounts these stories: the golden-and-black ring is stolen from a Spanish widow Sparrow by luring it, and the green dragon ring is reminiscent of his adventures in the Far East
 dep ke atirikt vichaaron main insaani anguuthon se bani ek necoles he jise spairo us samay pahentaa he jab pilagosto use khaane ke liye taiyaar hota he, or rajdand dep ke ek dost ke paas maujuud rajdand par aadhaarit thi

 He also took note of his political and social rights

 He also got knowledge of new ideologies and trends by staying here
 inhone shramik sanghathanon kii sthapana bhi kerani aarambhn There was a revolution in Russia in 1905, by which an attempt was made to establish a legal monarchy in Russia, but due to mutual quarrels, this revolution could not succeed and the rule was re-established
 is kranti kaa spasht parinaam yah hua ki usne rus kii saadhaaran janata ko raajnneetik adhikaron kaa parichay kara diya tha
 He came to know what the meaning of the vote is? How should members of Parliament be elected in Duma or in other words? The government should decide its policy according to the public opinion and move forward to do the works of public interest
 apane raajnneetik adhikaron se parichit ho jane ke kaaran rus kii janata samaj gai ki rus main bhi purnataya loktantr shashan kii sthapana honi chaiye jahaan saadhaaran janata ke haath main shashan satta ho
 The democracy states of Western Europe also had an impact on Russia, although the emperors of Russia made special efforts to stop the propagation of Western progressive ideas in Russia, but it is very difficult to stop the ideas, because ideas are like air

 His large army demonstrated great ability and competence at the start of the war, but after two years of continuous fighting, the signs of laxity were clearly visible in it

 Russian armies were recruited to meet the numbers
 unamem vir sainikon kii parampara avashya thi, par unke sammukh koi adarsh vishesh nahin tha
 This was the condition of Russia's bureaucracy
 rus ke karmchaaree yah nahin samajhate the ki ve desh kii unnati or raashtra seva ke liye niyukt kiye gayi hai
 His ideal was to please the emperor and occupy high positions
 jab vishwayuddh lambaa hota gaya or do varsh kii ladaai ke uparaant bhi vijay ke koi chinh prakat nahin hue to rus kii sena or naukarshahi ghabara uthi
 Bribery, corruption etc
 had already attained their climax in Russia

 Finally, on 7 March 1917, the public's condition became very miserable
 uske paas na pahanane ko kapadaa tha or na khaane ko anaaj tha
 She was distraught with hunger and clothes
 pareshaan hokar bhukhe or thand se thithurate hue garib or majaburon ne 7 march din petrogred kii sadakon par ghoomana aarambh kiya
 Bread shops were piled with fresh and hot rotis
 bhukhi janata kaa man taaji or garam chaay va rotiyon ko dekhakar lalachaa gaya or vah apane aapako niyantran main nahin rakh saki
 They started looting in the market
 sarkaar ne sena ko un par goli chalaane kaa aadesh diya ki vah goli chalaakar luutmaar karne waalon ko teetar-bitar kar de, kintu sainikon ne goli chalaane se saaf manaa kar diya kyonki unako janata se sahanubhuti thi
 The spirit of revolution had entered them as well
 jab mazdooron ne yah dekha ki sainik un par goli chalaane ko taiyaar nahin hai, to unka saahas bahut bad gaya
 Hence, the revolution had become inevitable now
 duusari ore duma ne visarjeet hone se manaa kar diya
 It was compromised by the Petrograd Soviet, on the basis of which a social government was established on 14 March 1917 AD under the chairmanship of the liberal leader George Slavin

 Bounded by the situation, he accepted his demand and resigned from the government
 is prakaar rus main jaarshahi kaa ant hua
 The workers were successful in the revolution, but they did not think it appropriate to keep the reins of governance in their hands, and handed over all the power to the middle class

 'kashika' shabd ke do arth ho sakate hai
