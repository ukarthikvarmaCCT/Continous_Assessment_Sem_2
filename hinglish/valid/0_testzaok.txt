 An autotransformer is a transformer with a structure that has only one winding
 ek hi vinding kaa kuch bhaag primary kaa kaam karata he or kuch bhaag dwitiyak vinding kaa kaam karata he
 Thus, this single winding has at least three electrical ends
 is tarah kaa transafarmar samaan kevie reating se saamaanya transafarmar kii apeksha aakaar or vajan main chota hota he
 But there is no isolation between primary and secondary, which is essentially necessary somewhere
 autotransformar main ek hi vinding hoti he jiske do siron ke alaava bich main bhi ek yaa adhik truminal hote hai
 The primary is placed between the two ends
 output voltage bich ke kisi terminal or ek antim sire ke bich liya jaataa he
 Each turn of the entire winding of this transformer has the same voltage, whether it is in the turn primary or in the secondary
 autotransformar main primary se kuch dhara sidhe lod ko chali jaati he

 They are also autotransformers but the output is not taken from a fixed point, but through a carbon brush sliding on the winding
 isse laabh yah hota he ki output main ek seemaa ke andar koi bhi voltata praapt kii ja sakati he
 For this reason, it is used in testing many devices
 udhaaharan ke liye iskaa upyog balb ko aavashyaktaanusaar kam yaa adhik tivrata se jalaane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he

 Islam is a monotheistic religion which, according to its followers, is based on the teachings of the Qur'an, the last divine book of Allah, delivered by Muhammad, the last Rasul and prophet of Allah
 quran arabi bhashaa main rachi gai or isi bhashaa main vishwa kii kul jansankhya ke 25% hisse, yani lagbhag 1
6 se 1
8 arab logon, dwaara padhi jaati he; inamen se lagbhag 20 se 30 karod logon kii yah maatrubhaasha he
 The Sharia, a book written purportedly from the mouth of Hazrat Mohammad Saheb and providing instructions to follow the book, are the only two resources that rightly identify the source of Islam's information
 islamic dharm ke pramukh mat yah hai: Muslims believe in a single God whom they call Allah
 akeshwarwad ko arabi main tauhid kehete hai, jo shabd vaahid se aata he jiskaa arth he ek
 In Islam, God is considered beyond human comprehension
 musalamaanon se ishvar kii kalpana karne ke bajaay uski prarthana or jai-jayakaar karne ko kaha gaya he
 According to Muslims, God is unique - there is no one like him
 islam main ishwar kii ek vilakshan avadharana par bal diya gaya he or yah bhi mana jaataa ki uskaa sampoorn vivaran karnaa manushya se pare he
 Say: na use kisi ne janaa or na hi wo kisi kaa janak he
 And there is no one like that
 ” According to Islam, from time to time, God made a person his messenger for the guidance of man on earth
 lagbhag sansaar me 124,000 nabi ek khuda ko poojane kaa sandesh dene ke liye bheje gayi the
 These messengers were also among humans and called people towards God
 ishwar in duuton se vibhinn roopon se sampark rakhata tha
 These are called prophets in Islam
 jin nabiyon ko ishwar ne swayan, shaastra yaa dharm pustaken pradaan kin unhen rasul kehete hai
 Muhammad Sahab was also a part of this link
 unako jo dharmik pustak pradaan kii gayi uskaa naam quran he
 The Qur'an describes 25 other prophets of Allah
 swayan quran ke anusaar ishwar ne in nabiyon ke alaava dharti par or bhi kai nabi bheje hai jinka varnan quran main nahin he
 All Muslims accept the legitimacy of all prophets sent by God and Muslims consider Muhammad the last prophet of God
 ahmadiyya samudaay mohammad sahab ko antim nabi nahin maanata tathaapi swayan ko islam kaa anuyaayi kahata he or sanyukt raashtra dwaara sweekaara bhi jaataa he haalanki kai islamic rashtron main use muslim maananaa pratibandhit he
 According to the Supreme Court of India, he is considered a Muslim in India
 musalamaanon ke liye allaah dwaara rasulon ko pradaan kii gayi sabhi dharmik pustaken vaid hai
 According to Muslims, the Quran is the last religious book provided by God to man
 quran main chaar or pustakon kii charchaa he: Muslims believe that Christians and Jews have changed the messages in their books
 ve in chaaron ke alaava anya dharmik pustakon kaa ishwariya hone kii sambhaavna se manaa nahin karte hai
 Muslims believe in the existence of angels
 unke anusaar devdoot swayan koi vivek nahin rakhte or ishwar kii ajna kaa yatharoop paalan hi karte hai
 They are only abstract and flawless figures made of light, which are neither male nor female, but different from human beings in every sense
 haalanki devdoot agananeey hai, par kuch devdoot quran main prabhaav rakhte hai: Like other religions of Central Asia, in Islam also, the end of the universe is considered by the doomsday
 iske anusaar ishwar ek din sansar ko samaapt karegaa
 Only God is aware of when this day will come
 islam ke anusaar sabhi mrit logon ko us din punerjeevit kiya jayega or allaah ke aadeshaanusaar apana jivan vyateet karne waalon ko swarg bheja jayega or uskaa aadesh na manaane waalon ko nark main jalaayaa jayega
 Muslims believe in luck
 bhagya kaa arth inke liye yah he ki ishwar beete hue samay, vartmaan or bhavishya ke bare main sab jaanata he
 No event can happen without his permission
 manushya ko apni ichha se jeene kii swatantrata to he par isaki anumati bhi ishwar hi ke dwaara use di gayi he
 According to Islam, man is himself responsible for his misdeeds because God allows man to take them for himself or not
 uske kukarmon kaa bhi purv gyaan ishwar ko hota he
 There are two major classes of Islam, the Shia and the Sunni
 donon ke apane apane islamic niyam hai lekin aadharbhoot siddhanth milte-julate hai
 Many Sunnis do not consider Shias completely Muslims
 sunni islam main har musalmaan ke 5 aavashyak kartavya hote hai jinhen islam ke 5 stambh bhi kaha jaataa he
 Slightly different doctrines are called stanzas in Shia Islam
 sunni islam ke 5 stambh hai- Arabic: لا اله الا الله محمد رسول الله Transliteration: La ilaha ilallah Muhammad Rasool Allah Hindi: There is no other God but Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah
 is ghoshnaa se har musalmaan ishwar kii akeshwarvadita or mohammad ke rasul hone ke apane vishwaas kii gavaahi detaa he
 This is the most prominent principle of Islam
 har musalmaan ke liye anivaary he ki vah ise sweekaare Islam has its own influence on every aspect of life for Muslims
 islamic siddhanth musalamaanon ke gharelu jivan, unke rajnatik yaa aarthik jivan, musalmaan rajyon kii videsh niti ityadi par prabhaav daalate hai
 The Shariah refers to a set of policies that is based on Islamic legal traditions and Islamic personal and ethical practices
 sharia kii niti ko neenv bana kar nyaayashastra ke adhyyan ko fiqah kehete hai
 Due to different interpretations of Islamic scholars in the case of Fiqh, jurisprudence in Islam got divided in many parts and many different jurisprudence related doctrines were born
 inhen panth kehete hai
 The major texts in Sunni Islam are- adhiktar musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki chaaron panth aadharbhoot rup se sahi hai or inamen jo matbhed hai vah nyaayashastra kii baarik vyakhyaaon ko lekar he
 Muhammad the Prophet attained the ultimate knowledge in the hills of Mecca around 610
 jab unhone upadesh dena aarambh kiya tab makka ke samrudh logon ne ise apni saamaajik or dharmik vyavastha par khatra samajha or unka virodh kiya
 Finally in 622 he had to travel from Mecca to Medina with his followers
 is yatra ko hijra kaha jaataa he or yaheen se islamic calendar kii shuruyaat hoti he
 The lives of the people of Madina were troubled by mutual fighting and the messages of Hazrat Muhammad Sahab made them very popular there
 630 main hazrat mohammad sahab ne apane anuyaayiyon ke saath ek sandhi kaa ulanghan hone ke kaaran makka par chadhaai kar di
 The Meccans surrendered and converted to Islam
 makka main sthit kaaba ko islam kaa pavitra sthal ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Prophet Muhammad saheb died in 632
 par unki mrityu tak islam ke prabhaav se arab ke saare kabeeley ek raajnneetik or saamaajik sabhyataa kaa hissaa ban gayi the
 After this, the Khilafat phase began in Islam
 mohammad ke sasur abu bakr siddiq musalamaanon ke pehle khalipha 632 main banaaye gayi
 Many prominent Muslims accepted the mill to be their caliph
 sunni musalamaanon ke anusaar abu bakr siddiq kii khilaafat ke sambandh main koi vivaad nahin hua apitu sabhi ne unhe khalifaa swikaar kar liya tha, sunni manytaaon ke anusaar hazrat mohammad sahab ne swayan apane swargvaas se purv hi abu bakr siddiq ko apane sthaan par imamat karne kaa kaary bhaar dekar abu bakr siddiq ke khalifaa hone kaa kaa sanket de diya tha san 632 main muhammd sahab ne apane aakhri haj main khumm sarovar ke nikat apane saathiyon ko sambodhit kiya tha
 According to Shia faith, he made his son-in-law Ali his heir in this title
 sunni is ghatana ko hazrat ali kii prashansa maatr maanate he or vishwaas rakhte hai ki unhone hazarat ali ko caliph niyukt nahin kiya
 Differences between the two sides begin about this
 haj ke baad mohammad sahab biimaar rahane lage
 He called all the big sahabis and said, give me a pen claim that i should write such a statement that if you don't stumble, Omar said that he is saying hejyaan and did not let it
 shiya itihaas ke anusaar jab pigambar sahab kii mrityu kaa samachar mila to bhi ye waapas na aakar sakipha main sabha karne lage ki ab kya karnaa chaiye
 At the time when Hazrat Muhammad died, Ali and some of his other friends were engaged in burying Muhammad saheb, Abu Bakr went to Medina and discussed for Khilafat
 madina ke kai log abu bakar ko khalipha banane par sahamat ho gayi
 Keep in mind that Mohammad Saheb and Ali's clan, that is, Bani Hashim Ali, wanted to be Khalifa
 par islam ke ab tak ke sabase bade samrajya ke vaaris ke liye musalamaanon main ekajutata nahin rahi
 According to many, Ali, who was the cousin of Muhammad Saheb and son-in-law, was also the real heir of Muhammad Saheb
 parantu abu baqar pehle khalipha banaaye gayi or unke marane ke baad umr ko caliph banaaya gaya
 This caused more fury among the supporters of Ali, but Ali remained silent for the good of the Muslims
 parantu shiya muslim ke anusaar mohammad ke chachaa jaad bhai, ali, jin kaa musalmaan bahut aadar karte the ne abu bakr ko khalipha maanane se inkaar kar diya
 But this controversy was averted in order to prevent the destruction of Islam, in fact, because of the wisdom of Hazrat Ali, the fighting of Muslim forces from the Eastern Roman Empire and the Iranian Empire took place during Abu Bakr's tenure
 yah yuddh mohammad ke jamaane se chali aa rahi dushmani kaa hissaa the
 Umar bin Khatab was made caliph in 634 after Abu Bakr
 unke kaarykaal main islamic samrajya bahut tezi se failaa or sampurna irani samrajya or do tihaai purvi roman samrajya par musalamaanon ne kabaja kar liya
 The entire empire was divided into various territories and a governor was appointed for each region which was under the Caliphate
 umr bin khattab ke baad usmaan bin afphan 644 main khalipha bane
 These were also among the prominent companions of Muhammad
 usmaan bin afphan par unke virodhiyon ne ye aarope lagane shuru kiye ki wo pakshpaat se niyuktiyaan karte hai or ki ali hi khalipha hone ke sahi hakdaar hai
 Then the spirit of rebellion arose in Egypt and from there an armed group of 1000 people came to Madina, the capital of Islamic Empire
 us samay tak sabhi khalipha aam logon kii tarah hi rahete the
 Therefore, this group succeeded in killing Usman in 656
 kuch pramukh musalamaanon ne ab ali ko khalipha sweenkar kar liya lekin kuch pramukh musalamaanon kaa dal ali ke khilaaf bhi ho gaya
 These Muslims believed that it was not right for Ali to become the Khalifa until the killers of Usman were punished
 yah islam kaa pehla grihayuddh tha
 Initially, a part of this group was led by Ayesha, Muhammad's wife
 ali or ashya kii senaaon ke bich main jang hooi jise jang-e-jamal kehete hai
 Ali's army conquered in this battle
 ab syria ke rajyapal muavia ne vidroh kaa bigul bajaayaa
 Mu'awiya was also a relative of Usman, there was no result of war between Mu'awiya's army and Ali's army
 ali ne samrajya main faili ashaanti par kaabo paane ke liye rajdhani madina se kufa main pehle hi badal di thi
 Mu'awiya's armies now spread throughout the Islamic Empire, and soon Mu'awiya was captured by the entire empire except the territory of Kufa
 tabhi ek kattarpanthi ne 661 main ali kii hatya kar di
 After Ali, however, Mu'awiya became the Khalifa, but there remained a section of Muslims who believed that the Khalifa of the Muslims could belong to the family of Muhammad
 unka maananaa tha ki yah khalipha swayan bhagwaan ke dwaara aadhyatmik maargdarshan paata he
 According to him Ali was the first Imam
 yah varg shiya varg ke naam se prasiddh hua
 The rest of the Muslims, who do not believe that only the family of Muhammad can be Khalifa, are called Sunni
 sunni pehle chaaron khalifaaon ko rashidoon khalipha kehete hai jiskaa arth he sahi maarg pe chalane vaale khalipha
 Khilafat became hereditary after Mu'awiya became the Caliph
 isse umayyad kilaafat kaa aarambh hua
 According to Shia history cars, Yazid, son of Mu'awiya, started working against the policies of Islam as soon as he got the Khilafat, religious Muslims became uncomfortable by his act, now Yazid needed to recognize his wrong policies from such a person Grant that all Muslims trust, for this work, Yazid gave the blessings of Hazrat Muhammad, Hazrat Ali Alaihis Salaam and Hazrat Muhammad's only Hazrat Hussain, son of the daughter of Fatimah, wanted to sanction his Khilafat but Hazrat Hussain refused to give his approval because of his actions against the policies of Islam
 On the refusal of Hazrat Hussain, the soldiers of Yazid, Hazrat Hussain and his 72 Stopped water on the companions and took their housemates hostage by killing them with great disrespect, sunni mat ke bade vidhwano imam ahamed bin hambl, imam gajali vagairah ne yajid ko qatle hossain karne kaa zimmedaar nahin mana he
 Hussein attained martyrdom in this battle

 of ancient Yunnan, India, China and Persian civilizations and translated them into Arabic
 visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki is ke kaaran bahut bada gyaanakosh itihaas ke pannon main khone se rah gaya
 Muslim scholars did not just translate
 unhone in sabhi vishyon main apni chhap bhi chodi
 Many new discoveries related to anatomy and diseases in medical science were made in India, such as the difference between measles and smallpox was understood

 yah sampark mohammad ke samay se hi shuru ho gaya tha
 Apart from Islam at that time, there were 3 traditions in Arabia
 ek to arab kaa purana dharm tha jisaki vaidhata islam ne nahin sweekaar kii
 The reason for this was that religion did not believe in the unity of God, which was against the basic principles of Islam

 Muslim Caliphs had to pay a fee called Jizya or Jiziya
 iske badale rajya unhen haani na pahunchane or suraksha dene kaa vaada karata tha
 Those who embraced Islam were often discouraged during the tenure of the Ummayads

 By this, the jizya or jizya was beginning to decrease
 bharat main islam kaa aagaman to arab vyapaaree 7veen sadi main hi le aaye the
 But the early Muslim sultans arrived in India only in the 10th century

 Therefore, all of them adopted their attitude towards Hindu religion according to their understanding
 shuru main kuch muslim sultaanon ne hindu dharm kii kam jaankaree hone ke kaaran use puraane arab ke bahudevvaad ke saath joda

 Money will be spent in the development of the country
 But there is a concern, does this hurt the basic spirit of the Constitution
 These differences can be overcome with constitutional amendment and political assent
 murdahia dalit sahityakar dow tulsiram kii aatmakatha he, jiske madhyam se lekhak ne kai varshon se dalit aatmakathaaon main sahitya jagat ke bandhe-bandhaaye mandandon ko todakar apane jivan se jude us sachche or kaduve yatharth ko sabake saamne ujagar karne kaa prayaas kiya he, jise unhone swayan jhela
 Sankhya is also one of the six types of Indian philosophy which was very popular and famous in ancient times
 yah advait veydant se sarvatha vipareet manyataayen rakhane vaala darshan he
 The original person who founded it is called Kapil
 'sankhya' kaa shabdic arth he - 'sankhya sambandhi' yaa vishleshan
 Its most prominent belief is that the creation is made up of the nature man, here nature is the root and the male conscious
 yoga shastron ke urja strot, shakton ke shiv-shakti ke siddhant iske samaanaantar dikhte hai
 Sankhya philosophy once held a very high place in Indian culture
 desh ke udaatt mastishk sankhya kii vichaar paddati se sochate the
 The Mahabharata has even said that if knowledge comes, then there are few numerical figures, Mahanmahatma
 vastut: mahabharat main darshanik vichaaron kii jo prishthbhumi he, usamen sankhyashastra kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 The ideas of Samkhya Darshan have been mentioned in many poetic and interesting ways at many places of Shanti festival
 sankhya darshan kaa prabhaav gita main pratipaadit darshanik prishthbhumi par paryaapt rup se vidyaman he
 One of the reasons for its popularity has been that this philosophy has resolved the contrast seen in life in a beautiful manner by repudiating the trinitarian nature as omnipresent
 sankhyacharyon ke is prakruti-kaaran-vaad kaa mahaan gun yah he ki pruthak-pruthak dharm vaale sat, rajas tathaa tamas tatwon ke aadhaar par jagat kii vishmata kaa kiya gaya samaadhaan bada buddhigamya prathit hota he
 By not considering any temporal problem as the law of God, the reason for deteriorating the synergy of these forms and not making effort of the creatures
 yani, sankhya darshan kii sabase badi mahanata yah he ki isamen sristi kii utpatti bhagwaan ke dwaara nahin maani gayi he balki ise ek vikasaatmak prakriya ke rup main samajha gaya he or mana gaya he ki sristi anek anek avasthaaon se hokar guzarane ke baad apane vartmaan swaroop ko praapt hui he
 Kapilacharya is considered by many to be an atheist but this notion has been denied in texts like Bhagavad Gita and Satyarthraprakash
 sankhya-darshan kaa mukhya aadhaar satkaryawad he
 According to this theory, work cannot originate without reason
 faltah, is jagat kii utpatti shunya se nahin kisi mul satta se he
 This theory is contrary to Buddhist nihilism
 kaary, apni utpatti ke purna kaaran main vidyaman rahata he
 Work is the essence of its cause
 kaary tathaa kaaran vastutah samaan prakriya ke vyakt-avyakt rup hai
 Matrimonialism has two distinctions - consequentialism and discourse
 parinamwad se taatpary he ki kaaran vaastavik rup main kaary main parivartit ho jaataa he
 Like in sesame oil, milk is converted into curd
 vivartvaad ke anusaar parivartan vaastavik na hokar abhas maatr hota he
 Like the feeling of a snake in a rope
 sankhya darshan prachinkaal main atyant lokapriy tathaa prathit hua tha
 Sankhya philosophy once held a very high place in Indian culture
 desh ke udaatt mastishk sankhya kii vichaar paddati se sochate the
 The Mahabharata has even said that if knowledge comes, then there are few numerical figures, Mahanmahatma
 vastut: mahabharat main darshanik vichaaron kii jo prishthbhumi he, usamen sankhyashastra kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 The ideas of Samkhya Darshan have been mentioned in many poetic and interesting ways at many places of Shanti Parva
 sankhya darshan kaa prabhaav gita main pratipaadit darshanik prishthbhumi par paryaapt rup se vidyaman he
 In fact, Sankhya philosophy became very popular at some time
 isaki lokapriyata ke or chaahe jo bhi kaaran hon par ek to yah avashya rahaa prathit hota he ki is darshan ne jivan main dikhaai padane vaale vaishamy kaa samaadhaan trigunatmak prakruti kii sarvakaaran rup main pratishtha karke bade sundar dhang se kiya
 The great quality of this nature-cause-debate of Sankhyacharyas is that the solution of the illusions of the world on the basis of the elements of different religions, Rajas and Tamas elements, seems to be very just and wise
 "sankhya" shabd kii nishpatti "sankhya" shabd ke aage anu pratyay jodne se hoti he or sankhya shabd kii vyutpatti saarchaksh dhaatu khyan darshain pratyay taap he, jiske anusaar iskaa arth samyak khyaati, sadhu darshan athwa satya gyaan he
 This due fame of the Sankhyacharyas, this true knowledge of them, lies in the separation of the male form of the Chitta element from the person's form and the dual aspect of the person
 upar-upar se prapanch main sanaa hua dikhaai padane par bhi purush vastut: usase achoota rahata he
 In spite of being seen as indulgent or indulged in it, one remains virtually unattached or uninterested - this greatest philosophical discovery of the Sankhyakaris is treated in his own words by the names Satvapurushanyakhyati, Vivek Khyati, Prakritik Vigyan, etc
 isi vivek gyaan se maanav jivan ke param purusharth yaa lakshya kii siddhi maanate hai
 Thus "number" is an abbreviation to reveal the true form of the greatest philosophical discovery of the word numerology, being the first lecturer, his ideology was named as "samkhya" in very ancient times
 gananarthak "sankhya" shabd se bhi "sankhya" shabd kii nishpatti maani jaati he
 In the Mahabharata, both these types of expressions have been revealed in a verse about Sankhya
 vah is prakaar he- sankhyan prakurvate chaiv prakrutin c prachakshate
 Tattvānti Ch Chatuvinsdān Ten Samkhya: Prakritita:
 iskaa shabdaarth yah he ki jo sankhya arthath prakruti or purush ke vivek gyaan kaa upadesh karte hai, jo prakruti kaa prabhaav pratipaadan karte hai tathaa jo tatwon kii sankhya choubees nirdhaarit karte hai, ve sankhya kahe jate hai
 Some people are of the opinion that the secondary goal of the word "number" in the form of knowledge is considered to be the attainment of Kaivalya or salvation, the ultimate goal of life from the wisdom of nature and man, hence the attainment of that knowledge is the main and For this reason, the whole force of Samkhya is on him
 sankhya choubees tatv maanata he, yah to ek saamaanya tathy kaa kathan maatr he, at: gaun he
 Udayveer Shastri in his treatise entitled "history of Samkhya Darshan" quotes the interpretation of Sridhar Swami on Bhagavata 3-25-1 in being propounded by Kapila of the Samkhya Shastra - the interpreter explaining the last verse clearly It is written - Element number numerator: Sankhya-promoter Ityarth:
 isse nishchit ho jaataa he ki yahi kapil sankhya kaa prarvatak yaa praneta he
 Scribe of Sridhar Swami: On the word, Shastri ji has written in the footnote given below - Some interpreters of the medieval period have interpreted the word "sankhya" in the term "sankhya" as calculative
 vastut: iskaa arth tatv gyaan he
 But considering it deeply, it is not as common or secondary as it seems to be an emergency
 aisa prathit hota he ki bahut pracheen kaal main darshanik vikaas kii praarambhik avasthaa main jab tatwon kii sankhya nishchit nahin ho pai thi, tab sankhya ne sarvapratham is drishyman bhautik jagat kii sookshm mimasaa kaa prayaas kiya tha jiske falswaroop uske mul main vartmaan tatwon kii sankhya saamanyat: choubees nirdhaarit kii thi
 In these also the first element which he named "prakriti" or "pradhan" was proved to be the origin of the remaining twenty three
 chit purush ke saannnidhya se isi ek tatv "prakruti" ko kramash: taees avaantar tatwon main parinat hokar samast jad jagat ko utpann karti hui mana tha
 Thus behind the determination of element number, there seems to be a huge intellectual practice of statistics
 aakhir sookshm buddhi ke dwaara deergh kaal tak bina chintan or vishleshan kiye tatwon kii sankhya kaa nirdhaaran kaise sambhav hua hoga? From the above discussion, it is decided that the "sankhya" name of Sankhya philosophy is indicative of its rational argument with both types
 sankhyon kaa achit prakruti tathaa chit purush, donon hi moolbhoot tatwon ko aagam yaa shruti pramaan se siddh maanate hue bhi mukhyat: anumaan pramaan ke aadhaar par siddh karnaa bhi isi baat kaa parichaayak he
 It is clear from the view of both the Samkhya discourse formulas and the numeric texts available these days that it is proved by the inference based on both the fundamental elements of Samkhya - nature and power of man
 purush kii anekta main bhi yuktiyaan hi di gai hai
 Satirism has also been established on the basis of arguments
 
 Thus the Sravana scripture, which is the foundation of wisdom knowledge, is logic-oriented
 manan, anukaal tarkon dwaara shastrokt tathyon tathaa siddhanton kaa chintan he hi
 Thus, the number or wisdom due to which the Sankhya philosophy got its "sankhya" name has a special relationship with logic and intellectualism
 is buddhivaad ke kaaran avaantar kaal main sankhya darshan ke kuch siddhant vaidic sampradaay se bahut kuch swatantra rup se viksit hue jiske kaaran baadaraayan vyas tathaa shankaracharya aadi aacharyon ne iskaa khandan karte hue avaidic sampradaay, tak kah daalaa
 This sect does not appear to be non-vedic in its origin and in its latter form is also not completely vedic
 prasiddh bhashyakaar vigyanbhikshu ne bhi sankhya ko aagam yaa shruti kaa sat tarkon dwaara kiya jane vaala manan hi mana he
 He has said the same thing in his Sankhya discourse-sutra-annotation of the commentary - "vedic scripture", which removes all the campaign of male-related Vedic word, to free it and free the man from all kinds of cosmic forms
 It is said that the narrator Narayanavatar Bhagwan Kapil was born to preach the Sad tips required for contemplating the meaning of those Vedas
 vigyaan bhikshu ke purv pravachanon se spasht he ki ve sankhya shaastra ko vedanusaari maanate hai
 He is clear that he supports the meaning of the Vedic verses "ekvidiyyah", etc
 through Sad tips and arguments, rendering and deliberating it makes it understandable
 vigyanbhikshu ne vastut: lok main prachlit purv parampara kaa hi anusaran karte hue apana purvokt mat prakat kiya he
 Since the very ancient times, in the Mahabharata, Gita, Ramayana, Smriti and Puranas, not only is there a mention of the Sankhya as a high knowledge, but there is also a detailed description of its principles
 gita main bhi sankhya darshan ke trigunatmak siddhant ko badi sundar reeti se apanaaya gaya he
 "trigunatmika Prakriti is the continual resultant
 uske teenon gun hi sadaa kuch na kuch parinaam utpann karte rahete hai, purush akarta he" -sankhya kaa yah siddhant gita ke nishkaam karmyog kaa aavashyak ang ban gaya he 
 Similarly elsewhere, many theories of Samkhya philosophy are visible in the ancient Sanskrit Vadmay, complementing the principles of other philosophies
 in sab baton se aisa prathit hota he ki yah darshan apane mul main vaidic hi rahaa he, avaidic nahin, kyonki yadi satya isse vipareet hota to vedapraan is desh main sankhya ke itane adhik prachaar-prasar ke liye uparyukt kshetra na miltaa
 Vedanta commentator Shankaracharya, who refuted it as Vedah due to the so-called Vedas against the principles of Atheism, Prakriti dualism, consequentialism, etc
, also had to write in the commentary of Brahmasutra 2
1
3 that "even after having many spiritual memories, the Sankhya Yoga memories only Attempt was made in disposal
 kyonki ye donon lok main param purusharth ke saadhan rup main prasiddh hai, shisht mahapurushon dwaara gruhit hai tathaa "tatkaarann sankhya yogabhishanna gyatva devam muchyate sarvapashai: yaa ityadi shrot lingon se yukt hai
 "it is also clear from the evidence of the commentator himself that even during the time of his predecessor Sutrakara, many elegant men considered Sankhya philosophy as Vedic philosophy and followed it as a means of ultimate effort
 in sab tathyon ke aadhaar par sankhya darshan ko mulat: vaidic hi maananaa samichin he
 Yes, in its later development it must have gone against the Vedas in some fundamental principles like the latter is nirvishvara against the Sankhya Vedic tradition, its nature independently creates the entire world
 parantu is darshan kaa mul pracheenatam chhandogya evam vrihadaaranyak upanishdon main praapt hota he
 Its antiquity is evident from this
 is darshan ke do hi moulik granth aaj uplabdh hai- pehla chah adhyyon vaala "sankhya-pravachan-sutara" or doosraa sattar karikaon vaala "sankhyakarika"
 Apart from these two, there is also a very small sutra script which is famous as "tattva Samas"
 shesh samast sankhya vadmay inhen teenon kii tikaa or upatika maatr he
 Among them, Kapil is considered to be from the Upadesha tradition of Sankhya Sutras
 kai kaarnon se uplabdh sankhya-pravachan-sutron ko vidwaan log kapilkrit nahin maanate
 It is definitely certain that even considering these sources as Kapilopotip, many of its sites will have to be projected on the strength of the inter-target of the sources themselves
 sankhyakarikas, ishwarkrishna dwaara rachit hai, jinka samay bahumat se i
 tritiy shatabdi kaa madhya mana jaataa he
 In fact, their time seems to be long before this
 kapil ke shishy asuri kaa koi granth nahin bataaya jaataa, parantu inke prathit shishy acharya panchasikh ke naam se anek sutron ke vyasakrut yogabhashya aadi pracheen granthon main uddhrut hone se spasht prathit hota he ki inke dwaara rachit koi sutaragranth ati pracheen kaal main prasiddh tha
 By the opinion of many scholars, this famous book was Shashistantra
 udaiveer shastri ke mat se vartmaan kaal main uplabdh shadadhyaai sankhya-pravachan-sutara hi shashthi padaarthon kaa nirupan karne ke kaaran "shashthitantr" ke naam se bhi gyaat tha
 By his opinion, probably Panch Shikhacharya of Kapil Muni had written an explanation on it and that too was called Shashtantra in the name of the original text
 kuch vidwaanon ke mat se "shashthi tantra" prasiddh sankhyacharya varshganya kaa likhaa hua he
 Today there is no special knowledge about many other ancient figures like Jagishdhya, Deval, Asit etc

 Tipu Sultan was the ruler of the erstwhile Mysore state of Karnataka India
 tipu sultan kaa janm 20 navambar 1750 ko karnataka ke devnahalli kimi uttar me) hua tha
 His full name was Sultan Fateh Ali Khan Shahab
 unke pita kaa naam haidar ali or mata kaa naam fairunnisa tha
 His father Hyder Ali was the Sainapati of the Kingdom of Mysore, who by his own strength became the ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore in 1761
 tipu ko mysore ke sher ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Apart from a worthy ruler, Tipu was also a scholar, skilled scholar, and poet
 tipu sultan ne hindu mandiron ko tohafe pesh kiye
 The temple at Melkot contains gold and silver utensils, whose inscriptions suggest that these were gifts by Tipu

 Tipu Sultan ascended the throne of Mysore in 1782 after his father Hyder Ali

 In the figure of Tipu, the British used to see a picture of Napoleon
 vah anek bhashaaon kaa gyaata tha apane pita ke samay main hi usne prashasnic sainik tathaa yuddh vidha leni prarambh kar di thi parantu uskaa sabase bada avagun yah tha ki vah ziddee or ghamandi vyakti tha
 This fortification led to his defeat
 He relied heavily on the Franciscans and regarded the powers of the native kings as he was as autocratic and independent as his father, but still cherished the sufferings of the subjects

 Scholars differ greatly regarding his character
 vibhinn angrej vidwaanon ne uski aalochana karte hue use atyaachaari or dharmant bataaya he
 According to history, Hyder rarely did any mistake and Tipu Sultan hardly did any work
 There is a saying in Mysore that Hyder was born to establish an empire
 or tipu use khone ke liye kuch aise bhi vidwaan he jinhone tipu ke charitra kii kaaphi prashansa kii he
 In fact, Tipu was an industrious ruler, a fundamental reformer and a great warrior

 If his victory was even greater, he would be praised for his character

 Cornwallis knew that his war with Tipu was inevitable
 or isliye mahaan shaktiyon ke saath vah mitrataa sthapit karnaa chahta tha
 He entered into a joint front against Tipu by entering into an alliance with the Nizam and Marathas and after that he declared war against Tipu, thus the Third Mysore War started
 This war lasted for two years, initially the British failed but in the end It was won

 The Marathas also got some share which led to the border of their kingdom to Tangbhadra, the remaining parts were kept by the British
 Tipu Sultan gave his two Pugas as Carnatic to the Carnavalis
 This defeat caused Tipu Sultan to lose a lot of his power
 The state company was surrounded by the state and their contact with the sea was broken
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki cornwalis ne is sandhi ko karne main jaldbaaji ki or tipu kaa purna nivas nahin kar ke bhul ki agar vah tipu kii shakti ko kuchal detaa to bhavishya main chaturth misur yuddh nahin hota lekin vastav main cornwalis ne aisa nahin karke apni doordarshta kaa parichay diya tha us samay angreji sena main bimaari faili hui thi or europe main englad or france ke bich yuddh kii sambhaavana thi aisi sthiti main tipu francisiyon ki sahaayta le sakate the agar sampoorn rajya ko angrej british rajya main mila letaa to marathe or nizaam bhi usase jalane lagate isliye cornwalis kaa uddeshy yah tha ki tipu kii shakti samaapt ho jaae or saath hi saath company ke mitra bhi shaktishaalee nahin ban sake isliye unhone bina apane mitron ko shaktishaalee banaaye tipu kii shakti ko kuchalane kaa prayaas kiya
 Tipu Sultan was deeply saddened by this humiliating treaty and due to his infamy, he wanted to overcome the British and overcome, Prakriti gave him such an opportunity but fate did not support Tipu, at this time there was war going on in England and France
 To benefit from the international situation, Tipu sent his Rajdoot to different countries and he gave the Franciscans various types of facilities in their state
 Radaan that its military organization they are Frsisi officer Nyukt and they help against the British that were necessary conflict between April 1798 e

 He decided to crush Tipu's power against Tipu
 He succeeded in tying up with the Nizam and the Marathas to combine the Nizam, but the Marathas did not give a clear answer
 In 1798, Wellejali entered into an alliance with the Nizam and this Announced that some part of the conquered territories should also be given to the Marathas
 With full preparation, Wellejali attacked Mysore in this way
