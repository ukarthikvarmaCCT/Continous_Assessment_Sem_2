 If any is the most popular ingredient in daily North Indian subcontinental breakfast, it is parantha
 ise banane kii jitani vidhiyaan hai vaise hi hindi main iske kai rup prachlit hai jaise paratha, parautha, paravatha, parantha or paraanwatha
 From north to south and from east to west it is part of the Indian kitchen and the breathtaking aroma of parantha that is baked on the pan every morning increases appetite
 haa swasthya kii drushti se ye avashya vasa se bharpoor hone ke kaaran simit maatra main hi upbhog kiye jane chaiye
 Parantha is made almost like bread, the only difference is its fomentation
 roti ko jahaan tave par senkane ke baad sidhe aanch par bhi phulayaa jaataa he vahiin parantha sirf tave par hi senka jaataa he
 After making the roti, pure ghee can be applied from above, while the paratha is baked by applying ghee or oil at the time of baking it on the pan
 bharwaan parantha banane ke liye aataa yaa maida mel kar uski loi bel kar usamen bharaavan bharen, phir use bel kar tave par senken
 The word paratha is made from overhead + period
 upari yani upar kaa or aavart yani chaaron or ghumana
 Just consider the method of baking bread or paratha made on a pan
 ise samtap miltaa rahe iske liye ise upar se lagaataar ghuma-phiraa kar senka jaataa he
 Like Phulkas, both the layers of parantha do not flower, but only the upper layer
 iskaa kram kuch yun rahaa upari+aavart > uparawata > paraanwatha > parantha
 By the way, simply the dish of diced flour = layer + flour = paratha = paratha
 bharat paryant or videshon main bhi ye bahut prachlit hai
 Parantha of Kerala is famous in South India
 isko vahaan protta kehete hai
 It has many layers with very smoothness

 boric amla yaa suhaaga se kaach main vishesh bhautik gun utpann ho jate hai, jaise nune prasar-gunank or adhik tanaav sahansheeltaa, tapiya sahan shakti evam adhik jal-pratirohakata
 Due to these properties, in the manufacture of accidental heat conversion items such as thermometer hose, lantern chimney and cooking utensils, the maximum amount of boric oxide and the amount of alkali are kept to a minimum
 sodium corbonate ke sthaan main anya kshar jaise potacium carbenet kaa bhi upyog vishesh kaachon main kiya jaataa he
 Often alkali is used as sulfate salts
 sis oxide ke liye adhiktar laal sis kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 This oxide increases both the density and spacing of the sachets, and due to this, such sludge is used in the manufacture of optical greens, hygienic and drinking vessels and artificial gems
 sisayukt kaach sheeghra hi kaate or paalish kiye ja sakate hai
 Potash alkali leaded sachets are the most luminous
 aluminium oxide, adhiktar felspar dwaara kaach main sammilit kiya jaataa he
 This oxide increases heat spread, hardness, durability, elasticity, tensile strength, luster and acid resistivity in the sludge
 iske dwaara kaach main samaangta or vaigyanik kaaryon main upyogi anya gunon kii vruddhi hoti he
 This reduces the diffusion coefficient of the oxide glass and the softening temperature
 yah vikachan ko roktaa he or iske prayog se kaach kaa dravan or shodh saral ho jaataa he
 Zinc oxide is often added to the slurry by zinc carbonate
 yah padaarth kaach ke prasar gunank ko bahut kam karata he
 It is used in the manufacture of chemical slabs because of the high stability in the slurry and the low heat dissipation
 kuch kaachon main magnesium yaa barium oxide bhi sammilit kiya jaataa he
 Some substances are added to the kach for the purpose of producing special chemical properties
 sis yukt kaachon main kuch oxykaarak padaarth, jese potacium nitrate yaa shora kaa hona aavashyak hota he
 Many small bubbles of gas, which are called 'seeds', get trapped in the gas when it is liquefied
 kaach ko inase mukt karne ke liye kuch rasinic padaarthon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 These substances become gases in the liquid slurry and bring the seeds out of the slice with them
 in padaarthon ko 'shodhak dravya' kehete hai
 Generally, carbon ammonium salt or arsenic is used for purification
 aalu, chukundar or bhigi lakdi ke tukade dravit kaach main daalkar bhi kahin-kahin kaach kaa shodhan kiya jaataa he
 Kach is used in many types of commodities that require different physical properties
 kaach ke bhautik gunon main bhinnata vibhinn oxidon dwaara laai ja sakati he
 The physical properties also depend on the relative quantity of each oxide present in the pot
 ghanatv- kaach main sabase adhik ghanatv sis oxide dwaara aata he or sabase kam boric oxide dwaara
 Electrical properties- The electrochemicality of a kach is dependent on its composition, temperature and atmosphere
 aajkal kaach kaa upyog achaalak ke liye bhi kiya ja rahaa he
 Thermal properties - The heat is transmitted when heated, but there is minimal diffusion of boric oxide and magnesium oxide and maximum expansion from alkaline oxide
 ushma chaalakata- kaach ushma kaa adham chaalak he; silica tathaa boric oxide se kaach main ushma-chaalakata kam hoti he
 Other physical properties of the sachets, such as Young's coagulation coefficient, stress strength, firmness and thermal tolerance, depend on the oxides contained in the sachets
 kaach main inke prabhaav kaa vaigyanik adhyayan karke rasinic kaach, ushmapratirohak kaach, jo laal tapt kar ekadam barf main thande kiye ja sakate hai or tapamapi kaach kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he

 pashcharikaran, bhojan banane ke bartan, lamp kii chimaniyaan, rasinic kaach or tapamapi kii nalee ke liye, ucch tapiya sahansheeltaavale kaach kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In order to produce greater thermal tolerance in the sachets, the amount of silica must be higher and the amount of alkali should be reduced and the sachets should also contain some amount of zinc oxide, boron oxide and aluminum oxide
 prakaashiya gun- lenson main prakaashiya gun, jaise ucch vartanaank evam vikshepan bhi, kaach main bhinn oxidon kii matraaon par nirbhar hai or isliye sis oxide, barium oxide or calcium kii matraaon ko ghataakar badhaakar prayek bhanti ke vishesh vartanaank or vikshepan ke bahumoolya kaach taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai
 For the transduction of ultraviolet light, the glaze of transdermide is made of mastic silica, as these springs cannot penetrate through ordinary mercury; But they can easily go beyond liquid quartz
 shyanta- kaach nirmaan main shyanta bhi ek aavashyak gun he, kyonki kaach kaa dhaman, peden, karshan or belanaa, bahut kuch kaach kii shyanta par hi nirbhar rahete hai; abhitaapan main vikruti ko hataanaa bhi shyanta se hi sidhaa sambandhit he
 The viscosity of the sachets depends on the oxide content of the sachets
 silica kii maatra badhaane se kaach kaa shyanta-paraas bad jaataa he; chooney kii vruddhi se shyanta badhati he, parantu shyanta-paraas kam hota he
 Viscosity decreases with increasing soda content, but viscosity increases
 jab kaach kii vastu ko garam kiya jaataa he to baahar kii sataha bheetar ke bhaagon ke apeksha adhik garam ho jaati he or isi prakaar jab tapt dravit kaach ko thanda karke thos kiya jaataa he tab thos hote samay kaach ke baahar kii sataha bheetar kii apeksha adhik thandi ho jaati he
 Due to the difference in temperature, there is uneven diffusion or shrinkage in the slag, which causes stress within it and corresponding distortions in the slag
 nirmaan ke samay kaach tapt rahata he, isliye thanda hone par kaach kii vastuon main pratibal or vikrutiyaan aa jaati hai
 The process of removing them is called the elimination of kach
 is vidhi main kaach kii vastuon ko phir se kaach ko komal honevaale taap se kuch kam taap par ek samaan tapt kar diya jaataa he
 This frees the kach from distortions due to change in viscosity
 tab kaach ko bahut dhire-dhire thanda kiya jaataa he
 This convergence-range also depends on the oxide content of the glass
 adhik ksharyukt kaach paryaapt nimna taap par abhithapit kiye ja sakate hai
 For complex sludge, such as chemical sludge heat resistant sachets, the absorbency heat is very high

 jin kaach paatro main aushadhi, bhojan yaa peya rakhaa jaataa he, unke kaachon par bahut samay tak dravon kii rasinic kriyahone kii sambhaavna rahati he
 All chemical particles have to suffer corrosion of water, acid and alkali
 dwarwale evam prakaashiya kaachon ko rituksharan sahanaa padataa he
 Therefore, it is necessary that these muds have such properties that the aforesaid corrosion has minimal effect on them
 kaach kaa sthayitv kaach ke bhinn oxide avyavon kii matraaon par nirbhar he
 The best substances to increase durability are zinc oxide, followed by aluminum, magnesium, and calcium oxide
 kshar kii maatra adhik hane par kaach kaa sthayitv ghatata he

 Since there is a provision in the Act that at least seven persons can organize a Loksamavaya together, so the remaining six persons of one person's family would be given a share
 at: ek vyakti dwaara niyantrit samavaay ko bure din dekhne padate the or ant main vah samavaay ladkadaa jaataa tha
 At the time of closing, the situation of that group was as follows- apratibhoot uttamarnon kii ore se yah tark prastut kiya gaya ki yadhyapi samavaay samamelit rahaa he tathaapi samavaay kaa kabhi bhi swatantra astitv nahin rahaa he

 ek harfanmaulaa aisa cricket khilaadi he jo niyamit taur par ballebaaji or gendbaaji donon main acha pradarshan karata he
 Although batting is essential for all bowlers and some batsmen also bowl occasionally, most players are proficient in only one of these two things and are considered experts
 kuch wicket-kiparon main visheshgy ballebaajon kii nipunata hoti he or ve bhi harfanmaulaa kahe jate hai, lekin unke liye wicket-keeper ballebaaj shabdaawalee kaa zyada istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The greatest all-rounders include George Hurst, Wilfred Rods, Mushtaq Mohammed, Keith Miller, Garfield Sobers, Andrew Flintoff, Walter Hammond, Ian Botham, Jacques Kallis, Kapil Dev, Richard Hadley, W
W
 G
 Grace, Chris Cairns, Shane Watson, Dwayne Bravo, Imran Khan and Shahid Afridi can be named
 vaise kisi khilaadi ke liye aisi koi sateek yogyata nahin he jiske aadhaar par use harfanmaulaa mana jaae or is naam kaa prayog vyaktiparak ho jaataa he
 It is usually called a 'real all-rounder' who has such a batting or bowling ability so that he is able to make a place in one of the teams for which he plays
 'vaastavik harfanmaulaa' kii ek or paribhaasha ye hai ki ek aisa khilaadi jo apni ballebaaji or gendbaaji se, lagaataar apane "dal ke liye match jeetne main madad kare" 
 By definition, a real all-rounder is an extremely rare and highly valuable player for a team as it effectively serves as two players
 kabhi-kabhi bhram kii sthiti paidaa ho jaati he jab ek visheshgy gendbaaj balle se acha pradarshan karata he
 For example, the great West Indian fast bowler Malcolm Marshall used to play good innings many times, but it was not so often that he was considered an all-rounder
 Instead, he can be called a good batsman of the lower order
 isi tarah ek visheshgy ballebaaj ko upyogi badlaav kaa gendbaaj kaha ja saktaa he or iske ek achche udhaaharan alan border hai jinhone 1989 main ek baar ek test match main tab 11 wicket liye, jab paristhitiyaan unke baayen haath kii phiraki gendbaaji ke anukool thim
 One of the major obstacles to becoming a recognized all-rounder is the arrival of batsmen and bowlers at different ages
 Bats reach their peak around thirty years of age when they mature with technical experience

 aankadon kaa ek saamaanya par istemaal kiya jane vaala niyam yah he ki khilaadi kaa ballebaaji ausat uske gendbaaji ausat se zyada hona chahie
 In Test cricket, there are only three all-rounders whose batting average is twenty points more than their bowling average: Garfield Sobers, Jacques Kallis and Walter Hammond
 However, there are other players who achieved this feat for a large part of their careers, such as Imran Khan, Steve Waugh, Andrew Symonds and Shane Watson
 Duff Walters achieved a difference of nearly twenty runs in his batting and bowling average from batting average of 48
26 and bowling average of 29
08, despite that he was generally considered to be an occasional bowler and partnership breaker, not a real all-rounder

 Fielding skills are considered to be another important basis of a player's all-round ability

 mulat: ek harfanmaulaa, ballebaaji kii apeksha gendbaaji main behatar hota he, isi tarah gendbaaji kii apeksha ballebaaji main behatar hota he
 There are very few who are good at both and perhaps none at all who are better at both
 yahi vajah he ki "gendbaaj harfanmaulaa" or "ballebaaj harfanmaulaa" naam saamne aae
 For example, in Test cricket, Keith Miller had a good batting average of 36
97, and had an excellent bowling average of 22
97, so he is called a bowler allrounder
 iske viparit, gairi sobers kaa 57
78 kaa jabardast ballebaaji ausat or 34
03 kaa gendbaaji kaa ausat tha, isliye unhen ballebaaj harfanmaulaa kaha ja saktaa he
 The real all-rounder is ideal for Imran Khan, who averaged 37 in batting and 23 in bowling, which is very good as a batsman and excellent as a bowler
 sobers "ab tak ke mahanatam harfanmaulaa" maane jate hai yadhyapi aankade bataate hai, ve bhi ek kshetra ke mukaable duusare main zyada achche the
 He is primarily described as a great batsman and a very good bowler

 sultan mohammad zahir ud-deen, jo aam taur par mirza mogul ke naam se jane jate hai, ek mughal rajkumaar the =
 He played an important role during the Indian Rebellion of 1857
 vah puraani dilli ke ek dwaar par maare gaye mughal rajkumaron main se ek the, jiske baad dwaar " khooni daravaaza " ke rup main janaa jane laga
 Mirza Mughal was the 12th and fifth son of the last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar
 unki maa, sharif-ul-mahal sayyidini, ek abhijaat varg sayed parivaar se ain, jisane hazarat mohammad se vansh kaa daawa kiya tha
 After the death of his elder half-brother Mirza Fakhru in 1856, Mirza became the eldest surviving legitimate son of Mughal Bahadur Shah Zafar
 haalanki, angrejon ne dilli ke singhaasana ke uttaradhikari ke rup main kisi ko pahchaanane se inkaar kar diya, or sanket diya ki jafar kii mrityu ke baad rajshahi samaapt ho jaaegi
 In May 1857, the British Indian Army soldiers revolted against their British officers and entered Delhi
 unhone mahal ke liye sidhe banaaya, apane british varisht adhikariyon ke khilaaf samraaton ke samraat ko avgat karaayaa, unke prati unke nishtha kii pushti kii, or abhayaarany or netritv kii maang kii
 a few days later, after taking stock of the situation, Mirza Mughal and some of his half-brothers pleaded with their father to be appointed in charge of the rebel soldiers
 unki yachika shuru main asweekaar kar di gai thi lekin baad main di gai, or mirza mughal, varisht-kanoonee rajkumaar ke rup main, commander-in-chif ko namit kiya gaya tha
 Mirza Mughal had absolutely no training or experience for her new office
 haalanki, unhone urjavan rup se sainikon ko vyavasthit karne, apni boli lagane or praavdhaan ke liye vyavastha karne kii maang kii, or kinare ke shahar main aadesh kii samanta laai
 His inexperience soon became apparent, and a few weeks after his arrival, Bakhtar Khan, a former non-commissioned officer at the British head of a large force in Bareilly, was provoked, who had earned a good during the Afghan Wars
 Prestige
 unke aagaman ke kuch samay baad, samraat ne bakhat khan commander-in-chif niyukt kiya or aapurti ke prabharee mirza mughal ko chhod diya
 a few weeks later, after another change of offices, Mirza Mughal was given the charge of administering the city of Delhi
 sitambar 1857 ke madhya tak, asangathit vidroh ne apana rasta tab tak chalaaya jab tak dilli shahar kaa sambandh tha
 British forces had reconsidered control of the besieged areas of Delhi and marched to the ridge close to the city for a final attack on the city, which was being rapidly abandoned by its citizens, who were mainly in the rural areas of their villages
 i had escaped
 jaise hi angrejon ne shahar kaa niyantran liya, samraat bahadur shah dwitiya ne laal kile ko chhod diya or humayun ke makbare main sharan lee, jo us samay dilli ke baahar thi
 He was accompanied by Mirza Mughal and two other princes
 unke thikaane kii report major hodsan se jasuson ne kii thi, jinhone unhen ek sandesh bheja tha ki party ko bhaagane kii koi ummid nahin thi or aatmasamarpan karnaa chahie
 He refused to surrender
 agali subah, hodsan ek sau ghudsavaar ke saath kabr par gaya or samraat or rajkumaron ke bina shart aatmasamarpan kii maang kii
 The situation is known to the people of the surrounding villages, and a large crowd gathered, many of whom were equipped with commonly held arms
 is bindu par pratirodh kabhi samraat kii yojana nahin thi, jo prarthana or shok karne ke liye apane shandaar purvavarti kabr par aa gaya tha, or shaayad ummid main ki makbare kii pavitrataa swayan or uske jivit parivaar ke liye abhayaarany pradaan karegi
 So he sent a message to Hodgson stating that he was surrendering to his party that his life and lives and the crowd that now surrounded him
 hodsan spasht rup se is par sahamat hue, keval yah bataate hue ki rajkumaron or graminon kii moti bheed ko turant apni bahon ko aatmasamarpan karnaa chahie
 Being compromised, the Emperor, relying on Hodgson's word as a British army officer, emerged from the tomb and exchanged greetings with Hodgson in person
 buudhe aadmi ko parishram ke saath behad kamjor lag rahaa he, hodsan ne samraat ko ek chhayaadaar ped ke neeche aaraam karne or tazaa karne ko sweekaar kiya
 He then sent the princes back to Delhi, riding in a bullock, with ten cavalry escorting British soldiers
 is bich, shesh nabbe sainikon ne graminon kii moti bheed kii bahon ko ikattha kiya, jinhone apane samraat kii boli par asantosh ke bina apane hathiyaaron ko aatmasamarpan kar diya
 Shortly thereafter, with the emperor safely but apparently in a position to be transported to the city, Hodgson set out for the city with a small party of soldiers
 ghodon par savaar hokar, ve jald hi rajkumaron ko le jane vaali party ke saath pakade gaye
 As he approached the city gates, Hodgson found that a crowd of towns had gathered in hopes of the return of the emperors and princes
 iske alaava, rajkumaron ke chalate utsuk graminon kii bheed ne dilli ke dwaaron ke liye kuch mile kii yatra kii thi
 It has been suggested that Hodgson lost his nerve upon seeing the crowd
 anya ne suzav diya he ki bheed kii upasthiti ne unhen suzav diya ki yah ek upyukt kshetra tha jisamen bharatiyon ko spasht sandesh bhejnaa or angrejon kii shakti or krurta kaa pradarshan karnaa tha
 Still others have suggested that Hodgson made a pact with the old emperor in bad faith and that he never intended to keep his word
 sabhi ghatnaon main, ek aisa vichaar jo ek gambhir samjhaute kaa ulanghan karata he, jise unhone kuch minute pehle banaaya tha, british sena ke adhikari ke rup main sammaan ke apane shabd par, in logon dwaara bahut sammanit ek buudhe aadmi ko, ise badhaane ke bajaay angrejon kii pratishtha, hodsan ke ken se pare spasht rup se thi
 At the city gate, Hodgson ordered the three princes to get off the cart
 tab unhen apane upree vastron se alag kar diya gaya
 The bare-chested princes were lined up in clear sight of the crowd
 hodsan ne phir apni bandook lee or khud ko teen nirbaadh or aadha nagn rajkumaron ko bindu-khaali seemaa par goli maar di
 After killing the princes, Hodgson personally broke his body of jewelery, signal rings, turquoise hand-bands, and bejeweled swords worn by the three princes
 unhone in keemati saamaanon ko yuddh kii trophy ke rup main pocket kiya, haalanki unhen sandigdh paristhitiyon main yuddh ke nirvasit kaidiyon kii hatya karke praapt kiya gaya tha
 The bodies of the three princes were thrown back into the bullock-cart, taken to the Kotwali within the city, thrown to the ground in front of that building and exposed there for the exit
 vah dwaar jiske paas nishpaadan kiye gaye the, khooni daravaaje ke naam se janaa jaataa he jiskaa arth he "khooni darvaja" "rakt dwaar" yaa "maut kaa darvaja

 There were five main objectives of creating Java language: haalanki java kaa adhikansh pratyaksh munafa licencing or JCP sadsyta raashi se aata he, kuch maanate hai ki java pramukhtah hardware sarwar ko badhaava dene kaa ek vaahan or / yaa aantarik rup se san ke liye solaaris OS kii bikri hai or san ke upaadhyaksh rich green ne kaha ki java ke liye san kii adarsh bhoomika "enjilwad" ke jaisi he
 One feature of Java is affordability, which means that computer programs written in the Java language function similarly on any hardware supported / operating system platform

 maanaktaprapt libraries host vishisht suvidhaon jaise:- arekhi, threading or netwarking ke abhigaman ke liye ek kriyasheel rasta pradaan karte hai
 The most important benefit of using bytecode is affordability
 However, the overhead of interpretation means that interpreted programs always run more slowly than programs compiled from native executables, and Java's reputation is damaged due to poor performance
 haal hi main JVM karyanvayan main kai ishttameekaran takneekon ke aane se yah pareshaani thodi kam ho gai he
 Sun Microsystems officially licenses Java Standard Edition platforms for Linux, Mac OS x and Solaris
 Although Sun has previously licensed Java to Microsoft, the license has expired and has not been renewed
 tisare-samooh ke vikritaon or licendhariyon ke network dwaara, vaikalpik java envyranment iske or duusare plateformas ke liye uplabdh hai
 Sun's trademark license to use the Java brand asserts that all implementations are 'appropriate'

 san or dusron ne windos ke us or anya varsano ke liye muft java ran-time system uplabdh karaayaa
 Platform-independent Java is essential to the Java EE strategy and even more strict legalization is required to authenticate the implementation
 antahsthapit java envyranment kaa upyog karke, yah envyranment vahneey sarwar-said jaise web services, sarvalets or interprise javabins, saath hi saath osgi par aadhaarit antahsthapit system ko sakasham banaata he

 san JRE kaa superset bhi vitarit karata he jise java deveopment kit, kaha jaataa he jisame vikaas upkaran jaise java compiler, javadok, jaar or dibgar shaamil he
 It is difficult to compare the performance of a Java program to its equivalent program originally written in a compiled language because the target platform of Java's bytecode compiler is the Java platform itself, and the bytecode is either interpreted or compiled into machine code by the JVM
 goes
 in do bhinn drushtikonon: sthitik banaam gatisheel sankalan or punah sankalan or anya se utpann paridrishyon kii tulana karnaa bahut kathin or alag he
 Programs written in Java have been slower and require more memory than programs written in compiled languages
 jo kuch bhi ho, just-in time sankalan, ke aagaman ke kaaran java prograamon kii kriyanvayan gati teji se badi he, atirikt bhashaa visheshtaayen uttam code vishleshan, or java virtual mashin main swany ishtatameekaran ko samarthan karti he
 Java uses an automated garbage collector to manage memory throughout the object life cycle
 programmer nirdhaarit kar letaa he kab object kaa nirmaan hoga or ek baar object jab or upyog ke laayak nahin rah jaataa to uske smriti ko punah praapt karne kii jimmedaari java rantime kii hoti he
 Once no reference to the object remains, the inaccessible object becomes eligible to be automatically freed by the container
 kuch kuch memory risaav ke samaan tab bhi jari rah saktaa he agar ek programmer kaa code kisi object kaa ek sandarbh jisaki ab or jarurat nahin he use pakadta he, usee tarah jab objects jisaki or jarurat nahin he vah us container main sangrahit he jo abhi bhi istemaal main he
 If methods are called for a non-existent object, a "null pointer exception" is thrown
 java ke swachaalit smriti prabandhan model ke peeche ek vichaar yah he ki programmers niyamit smriti prabandhan ko prardashit karne kaa boj thodaa kam kar le
 kuch bhashaaon main object ke nirmaan ke liye smriti steke par anumaan se aavantit kii jaati he yaa spashtatya aavantit hoti he or dher se punah aavantit kii jaati hai
 In every way, the responsibility of memory management rests with the programmer
 agar kaarykram kisi object ko punahavanton nahin karata he to ek smriti risaav utpann hone lagata he
 If the program tries to access or reallocate memory that has already been reallocated, then the results become difficult to predict and interpret and the programs are likely either unstable and / or terminated
 ise smart sanketon ke istemaal se anshatah thik kiya ja saktaa he lekin yah uprivyay or jatilta ko badhaata he
 Garbage collection can occur at any time
 adarshatah yah tab hoga jab kaarykram khaali rahata he
 It is sure to run if there is insufficient free memory to allocate to the new object, which may cause a program to be installed momentarily
 spasht smriti prabandhan java main sambhav nahin he
 Java does not support c / c ++ style pointer arithmetic, where object addresses and unmarked integers can be used interchangeably
 yah kachra colector ko sandarbhit objectos ko sthanantarit karne kii anumati detaa he or iskaa bachaav or suraksha sunishchit karata he
 As in c ++ and some other object-oriented languages, Java's variable primary type is not an object
 praathmik prakaaron kii upyogita ko yaa to kshetron main pratyaksh rup se sanchit kiya jaataa he yaa dheron par naa ki steke par, jaisaa object ke liye saamaanya taur par sahi he 
 This was a conscious decision taken by Java's designers for demonstration
 iske kaaran, java ko ek shuddh object-unmukh programing bhashaa nahin mana gaya
 Whatever it is, as in Java 5
0, self-operation enables programmers to proceed if the primary types are instances of their wrapper ranges
 java ke vaakyavinyas zyaadaatar C++ se vyutpann he
 Unlike c ++, which combines design, methodology and program syntax, Java was created as an object-oriented language only
 sabhi code ek class ke bheetar likhe gaye hai or sabhi kuch ek object he; antarbhoot aakadon ke prakaaron ko chhodkar, jo pradarshan kaarnon se claason nahin he
 Java hides many features for classes, to simplify the language and to prevent natural errors and clutter
 java C++ kii tarah hi samiksha paddati upyog karti he
 There are two different types of reviews: single line style marking with two forward slashes and a multiline style open forward slash with asterisk and closed one asterisk with forward slash
 udhaaharan: Traditionally, helloworld
java is a public class naming of source files by applying the 
java suffix
 iskaa sankalan helloworld
class ke naam se file upadit karke sabase pehle java compiler kaa istemaal karke bitcode main hona chahie
 Only then can it be implemented or "executed"
 java strot file main ho saktaa he ki sirf ek public class ho lekin isamen public acces se tulana main kam multiple claason or kitni bhi sankhya main public inner claason shaamil ho sakati he
 a class that has been declared private can be stored in any
