 What's the entrance? · How to find a gateway · How to build a gateway • How to build a good gateway · How to join · See also The concept of a portal originated in the Polish and German Wikipedias
 In early 2005, the portal concept was imported to the English Wikipedia and the first Wikiportals were established
 Later that year, a special namespace was created for portals
 The idea of a portal is to help readers and / or editors navigate their way through Wikipedia topic areas through pages similar to the Main Page
 In essence, portals are useful entry-points to Wikipedia content
 Portals are subject to the five pillars of Wikipedia, and must comply with Wikipedia's core content policies like wikipedia:neutral point of view, wikipedia:no original research and wikipedia:verifiability
 At present, there are 0 featured portals, of a total of mold: Number of portals portals on Wikipedia
 All portals should be listed at the directory of portals, which also details their founding dates and whom you can contact with regard to a particular portal
 If you have created a portal, you must list it here
 portal:list of portals lists all portals of reader-ready quality
 Portals are also largely inter-accessible with users able to navigate from one portal to another
 Universal features, such as the browsebar, and the portals template, allow for convenient browsing
 Moreover, portals are also categorized according to hierarchy
 Portals, in most instances, will also link to their related portals and their subportals
 While the top-level portals are linked to directly from the Main Page, individual portals are linked by placing {{portal}} on a page
 In the main namespace, these templates should be located at the top of an article's talk page, often due to being integrated into wikiproject banner templates
 Per WP:ALSO, they may also be placed in the "see also" section of articles
 There is no single standard design for portals, but the most widely used layout is the "box portal"
 The use of this design is recommended due to the ease with which it can be created and maintained
 For further ideas on portal design, browse existing portals and see the featured portals
 For step-by-step instructions on how to set up a new portal, refer to the instructions page
 Once you have created the portal, please update {{number of portals}}
 Most portals contain the following for readers: You may want to embark on an effort to fill the related categories with appropriate articles if this has not been done already 
 Just as with Wikipedia at large, portals can be edited by anyone
 However, it is important to pay due regard to the established work of others
 Editors are always needed to maintain individual portals; if you would like to participate in the upkeep of a particular portal, note your intention on its talk page, list yourself as a maintainer in the directory of portals, and get to work! a wikiproject on Portals has been founded to coordinate portal activity
 The current objectives are to develop standards for all portals and to ensure maintenance
 Other tasks include the integration and categorisation of portals
 Immediate attention is needed at portals listed in Category: Portals under construction and Category: Portals needing attention

 The Tragedy of Macbeth is a play written by William Shakespeare on the murder and subsequent events, or, in short, Macbeth is a work of Shakespeare
 yah shakespeare kaa sabase chota shokat naatak he or mana jaataa he ki ise 1603 or 1603 ke bich kisi samay likhaa gaya tha
 The earliest reference to an act on Shakespeare's play is probably in April 1611 when Simon Foreman recorded one such play at the Globe Theater
 yah pehali baar 1623 ke pholio main prakashit hua tha jo sambhawatah ek vishisht abhinay ke liye ek samvaad bataane vaali pustak thi
 Shakespeare's sources for this bereaved play are references to King Macbeth of Scotland, Macduff and Duncan in Holinshed's Chronicles, a composition that is familiar to Shakespeare and his contemporaries in the history of England, Scotland and Ireland
 haalanki, shakespeare dwaara bataayi gayi makebeth kii kahani kaa scottish itihaas kii vaastavik ghatnaon se koi sambandh nahin he kyonki makebeth ek prashansit or sakasham samraat the
 Some in the theater's backstage world believe that the play is cursed and its title will not be mentioned insistently, instead it is referred to by names such as "the Scottish Play"
 sadiyon se is naatak ne makebeth or ladi makebeth kii bhoomikaaon main kai mahanatam abhinaytaon ko aakarshith kiya he
 It has been adapted for film, television, opera, novels, comic books and other media
 naatak kii pehali bhoomika garjan or bijli ke bich shuru hoti he jahaan teen chudilein yah faisla karti hai ki unki agali mulaaqaat makebeth ke saath hogi
 In the next scene, an injured Sergeant informs King Duncan of Scotland that his commanders - Macbeth and Banquo - have just defeated the combined armies of Norway and Ireland, led by the traitor mcdonwald
 raja ke rishtedaar makebeth kii bahaduree or yuddh kaushal kii prashansa kii jaati he
 The scene changes
 mausam or apni jeet par charchaa karte hue bauebeth or bainko pravesh karte hai 
 jab ve ek jhadidaar maidan main tahal rahe hote hai, teen chudilon kaa pravesh hota he jo unhen bhavishyavaaniyon ke saath badhai dene kaa intazaar kar rahi thim
 Despite that Banquo first challenges him, she encounters Macbeth
 pehali chudail makebeth ko "then of glamis" bulaati he, duusari use "then of codor" kahati he or teesri yah daawa karti he vah "iske baad ek raja" hoga
 Macbeth becomes stunned and silent, so Banquo challenges him again
 chudilein bainko ko bataati hai ki vah kai raajaaon ko janm degaa, haalanki vah swayan raja nahin banegaa
 jabaki donon vyakti in ghoshnaaon par aashcharya duube hote hai, chudilein gaayab ho jaati hai or ek anya then, raja kaa ek doot ross vahaan aata he or makebeth ko pradaan kii gayi nayi oopaadhi: then of codor ke bare main use suchit karata he
 Thus the first prophecy is fulfilled
 iske tatkaal baad makebeth apane man main raja banane kii mahatvakankshaayen viksit karnaa shuru kar detaa he
 Macbeth writes to his wife about the prophecies of witches
 jab dancan invarnes main makebeth ke mahal main rahane kaa faisla karte hai, ladi makebeth unki htya karne or apane pati ke liye singhaasana surakshit karne kii ek yojana banaati he
 Although Macbeth expresses concern over the murder, Lady Macbeth challenges his manhood and eventually convinces him to follow his plan
 raja ke aane kii raat ko makebeth dancan ko maar detaa he
 This act is not seen by anyone, but it shocks Macbeth so much that Lady Macbeth has to come forward to take charge
 apni yojana ke anusaar vah khooni khanjaron ko dancan ke soye hue sevakon ke paas rakhkar htya kaa aarope unke upar madh detii he
 Early the next morning, Lennox, a Scottish nobleman, and Macduff, a loyal leader of Fife, arrive there
 ek darban dwaar kholta he or makebeth unhen raja ke kaksh kii ore le jaataa he jahaan macdaf ko dancan kii laash kaa pataa chalata he
 Macbeth kills him before the guards can resist his innocence by creating a simmering sense of anger
 macdaf ko turant makebeth par andeh ho jaataa he lekin vah apni ashanka ko saarvajanik rup se prakat nahin karata he
 Fearing his life, Malcolm, Duncan's sons, flee to England and Donalban Ireland
 asli vaaris kaa palaayan unhen sandigdh bana detaa he or makebeth mrit raja ke ek sambandhi ke rup main scotland kaa nayaa raja banakar rajgaddi par baith jaataa he
 Despite his success, Macbeth remains uneasy about Banquo's prediction
 isliye makebeth unhen ek shahi bhoj ke liye aamantrit karata he or use pataa chalata he ki bainko or unka jawan betaa fleens usee raat ko baahar chale jaaenge
 vah do vyaktiyon ko unhen maarane kaa kaam detaa he jabaki ek teesraa kaatil bhi hatya se pehle park main prakat hota he
 While the assassins kill Banquo, Fleance escapes
 bainko kaa bhoot bhoj main pravesh karata he or makebeth kii jagah baith jaataa he
 Only Macbeth can see this specter; Macbeth is horrified at the sight of an empty chair when the desperate Lady Macbeth orders him to leave
 pareshaan makebeth ek baar phir teenon chudilon se miltaa he
 She reveals three spirits from her spell with three additional warnings and prophecies that tell her to be "wary of Macduff" but also states that "no harm to Macbeth to any woman born to any woman" "and he" will never be defeated until the Great Birnam Wood of the high Dunsinane Hill will come against him
 Since Macduff is in exile in England, Maccab l admit that he is safe, he kills everyone in the castle of Macduff, including Macduff's wife and their young children
 ladi makebeth apane or apane pati dwaara kiye gaye aparaadhon ke boj se veikshipt si ho jaati he
 She keeps repeating those terrible things all the time, starts walking in sleep and tries to wash away the spots of imaginary blood with her hands
 england main macdaf ko ross dwaara suchit kiya jaataa he ki "aapkaa mahal aashcharyachakit he; aapaki patni or bacchon kii krurtapurvak htya kar di gayi he
 "macbeth is now seen as a dictator and many of his nobles leave him and leave
 mailkam macdaf or angrej siward, northmberland ke arl ke saath dunsinen kaisal ke khilaaf ek sena kaa netritv karata he
 While encamped in Barnum Wood, soldiers are ordered to hide their numbers by cutting down tree twigs and taking them along, thus fulfilling the witches' third prophecy
 is bich makebeth ladi makebeth kii maut kii apni sikh par ek aatmachintan karata he 
 The fight culminates in the murder of young Seward and Macduff's confrontation with Macbeth
 makebeth ahankaar ke saath daawa karata he ki use darane kii koi jarurat nahin he kyonki vah kisi bhi aurat se paidaa hue vyakti se maaraa nahin ja saktaa he
 Macduff declares that he was "born with an incision / premature incision from his mother's womb" and thus "was not born to a woman"
 Not long after, Macbeth realizes that he has misinterpreted the words of witches
 macdaf nepathy se makebeth kaa sir kaat detaa he or is tarah antim bhavishyavaanee ko puraa karata he
 Although Malcolm, rather than the Fleins, sits on the throne, Shakespeare's audience knows the truth about the witches' prediction, "you will help make kings" in reference to Banquo, as James VI of Scotland also knows Banquo

 makebeth kii tulana shakespeare ke antni or cleopetra se kii gayi he
 Both Antony and Macbeth as characters want a new world, even at the cost of an old world
 donon ek singhaasana ke liye ladate hai or us singhaasana ko praapt karne main ek 'abhishaap' kaa saamana karte hai
 The curse for Antony is Octavius and Banquo for Macbeth
 In one place, Macbeth himself compares himself to Antony, saying "under Banquo / my talent has no value, as it is said / Mark Antony had more than Caesar
" " antat donon naatakon main shaktishaalee or chaalaak mahila charitra shaamil hai: cleopetra or ladi makebeth
 Shakespeare derived this story from several stories in Holinshed's Chronicles, a popular history of the British Isles known to Shakespeare and his contemporaries
 chronicals main donwald naamak ek vyakti apane raja king daf dwaara chudilon ke sampark main aakar maut ke ghat utaare gaye apane parivaar ke kai logon kii khoj karata he

 He and Banquo meet three witches who make exactly the same predictions as Shakespeare's version

 Macbeth has a long ten-year reign before the eventual coup by Macduff and Malcolm

 However some scholars believe that George Buchanan's Rerum Scoticarum Historia more closely resembles Shakespeare's version

 In no other version of the story does Macbeth kill the king in his own palace

 In the versions of the story that usually existed at the time, Duncan is ambushed and killed in Inverness
 shakespeare ne donwald or king daf kii kahani ko is prakaar goonth kar mila diya jo kahani ke liye ek mahatvapurn badlaav sabit hua
 Shakespeare has made another revealing change
 chronicals main bainko makebeth dwaara king dancan kii hatya main uskaa ek saathi he
 He also plays an important role in ensuring the fact that Macbeth, rather than Malcolm, regains the throne in the subsequent unexpected coup
 shakespeare ke samay main bainko ko stuart king james kaa pratyaksh purvaj mana jaataa tha
 The Banquo depicted in historical sources is quite different from the Banquo composed by Shakespeare
 aalochakon ne is badlaav ke liye kai kaaran bataaye hai
 At first it could be risky to portray the king's ancestor as a murderer
 bainko ke bare main likhane vaale us samay ke anya lekhakon jaise ki jin de shelandre ne bhi sambhawatah isi kaaran se apni rachana stuartide main bainko ko ek khooni nahin balki ek kuleen vyakti ke rup main chitrit kar itihaas ko badla he
 The second is that Shakespeare may have changed Banquo's character simply because there was no need for a dramatic character as the other companion for the murder; However, Macbeth needed to be given a dramatic change - a role that many scholars argue is fulfilled by Banquo
 makebeth ko baad ke sanshodhano ke mahatvapurn pramaan ke kaaran nishchit rup se dinaankit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Many scholars estimate that the likely date of its creation is between 1603 and 1606
 jis tarah yah naatak 1603 main king james ke purvajon or stuart ke singhaasana par baithne kaa jashn maanata hua prathit hota he, ve yah tark dete hai ki is naatak kii rachana 1603 se pehle hone kii sambhaavna nahin he or yah suzav dete hai ki aath raajaaon kii parade -- jise chudilein makebeth ko bhoomika IV ke ek drishy main dikhaati he -- yah king james ko sampoorit he
 Other editors have speculated a more specific date 1605–6, the main reason being the possible indication of gunpowder and the resulting traces

 Although "farmer" is a common term, and "round-the-clock" was also the subject of a 1583 book by Queen Elizabeth's chief adviser Lord Burghley and a 1584 Docine of Aquivocation composed by Spanish head pastor Martin Ezpilcueta in the 1590s

 These modifications, which have been considered to have included the entire portion of role III, scene v, and a portion of role IV, scene I, since Clairdon's version of 1869, are often reflected in modern textual content
 is aadhaar par kai vidwaan devi hekets ke saath sabhi teen tamaashon ko apramanik maanakar asweekaar karte hai
 Even with Hecate's material, the play is conspicuously short and therefore the folio text is taken from a dialogue book that is heavily truncated for acting or that the text itself is an adapted piece

 In short: it is more than a thousand lines shorter than Othello and King Lear and only a little over half as long as Hamlet

 This brevity has also been linked to other unusual features: the first piece of the first role, which appears to have been "exposed to action"; Comparative simplicity to characters other than Macbeth; The oddness of Macbeth himself compared to other tragic heroes of Shakespeare

 When he feels himself "dressed up in credit" after his new title of Theor of Codor as predicted by witches, confirmed by Ross, Banquo says: "incidentally the new honors he receives are our strange Like clothes, they are not made to fit, so they are worn with the help of some things "
 And finally, when the dictator is obliged to turn around and confront Dunsinen, Caithness sees him as a man trying in vain to tie a large robe with a very short belt: "he cannot control his perverted cause
" May / rule by the same belt ", while Angus presents in a similar instance the kind of abstract that Harai thinks after Macbeth is ruling: is he now His title looks big enough for himself, just like the cloak of a giant man over a thief

 As Kenneth Muir writes, "macbeth does not have a tendency to commit murder; he has only an excessive ambition that in itself seems to be a minor sin than a failure to get the throne to the murder
" kuch aalochak jaise ki i
i

 Shakespeare's viewer expects villains to be completely evil, and the Senecan style is far from being a villain-like hero, but everyone demands it
 abhi tak anya aalochakon ke liye makebeth kii prerana ke sawaal ko hal karnaa itnaa aasaan nahin rahaa he
 Robert Bridges, for example, felt a paradox: a character capable of expressing such real terror before Duncan's murder would probably be unable to carry out such a crime
 For many critics, Macbeth's motivations in the first role appear unclear and inadequate
 jon dover wilson kii pariklpana yah thi ki shakespeare ke mul paath main ek yaa anek atirikt drishy the jahaan pati or patni ne apni yojanaon par bahes kiya tha
 This interpretation is not entirely practicable; However, the motivating role of Macbeth's ambition is universally recognized
 uski mahatvakanksha se prerit dushtataa ke kaary use ek badhati dushtataa ke chakra main ulajhaate hue prathit hote hai, jaisaa ki makebeth swayan apni pahchaan karata he: "main khun main hoon / itani dur bad gaya ki mujhe or adhik aage nahin badhanaa chahie / waapas lautnaa utana hi kathin tha jitna ki aage badhanaa
" The disastrous consequences of Macbeth's ambition are not limited to him
 naatak main lagbhag hatya ke samay se hi scotland ko swaabhaavik vyavastha ke vipareet ghatnaon se vichlit desh ke rup main darshaya gaya he
 Shakespeare may have intended to refer to a great series of life, although the play's images of chaos are mostly not specific enough to support elaborate intellectual textual content
 He also intended to elaborately praise James's belief in the divine right of kings, though the hypothesis that Henry
 Ann is mentioned at length at most by Paul, not universally accepted
 haalanki jis tarah julius seizar main raajnneetik kshetra main avyavashtaaen pratidhwanit hoti hai or yahan tak ki bhautik jagat kii ghatnaon dwaara parilakshith hoti he
 The most frequently depicted inverse of the natural order is sleep
 Macbeth's declaration that he has "killed sleep" is figuratively reflected in Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking
 madhyayugin dukhaant naatak ke liye makebeth ke aam taur par sweekaarya aabhaar ko aksar naatak main naitik vyavastha ke varnan main mahatvapurn rup main dekha jaataa he
 Glenn Wickham connects the play with a mysterious drama through the concierge to the creepy plot of hell
 harvard felprin kaa tark he ki naatak kii aksar sweekaarya sthiti kii tulana main "roodhiwaadee isai dukhaant naatak" kii ore ek kahin adhik jatil pravriti he; ve naatak or madhyayugin pujan sambandhi drama ke bheetar taanashaah bhoomikaaon ke bich ek sambandh dekhte hai
 Bisexual content is often seen as a particular aspect of the subject of the disorder
 maanak lingi bhoomikaaon ke ulat bhoomikaayen sabase adhik mashhoor rup se chudilon or ladi makebeth saath judy hui hai jis tarah vah pehali bhoomika main dikhaai detii he
 Regardless of the category in which Shakespeare's sympathy with such inversions occurs, the play ends with a complete return to normative gender values
 kuch nariwadi manovishleshnatmak aalochak jaise kii jenet adeleman ne lingi bhoomikaaon ke saath naatak ke aacharan ko vipareet swaabhaavik vyavastha kii isaki badi vishay-vastu se joda he
 In this light, Macbeth is punished by his removal from the cycle of nature for the encroachment of the moral system; Nature itself is part of the restoration of the moral system
 beesvin sadi ke shuru main aalochakon ne sthiti ke khilaaf pratikriya vyakt kii thi jise unhone naatak kii aalochana main charitra ke adhyayan par ek atyadhik nirbharta ke rup main dekha tha
 However, this dependence is most closely associated with Andrew Cecil Bradley, which is at least evident by the time of Mary Cowden Clarke, who provided an accurate, if fictional account of Shakespeare's pre-play life in the lead female roles
 udhaaharan ke liye unhone suzav diya ki balika ladi makebeth pehali bhoomika main ek moorkhtapurna sainya karrwai ke dauraan mrityu ko sanderbhit karti he
 The three chudels in the play represent darkness, chaos and conflict while their roles as agents and witnesses

 During Shakespeare's time, witches were viewed as worse than rebels, "who may be the most notorious treacherous and seditious
" " ve naa keval raajnneetik gaddaar the balki aadhyatmik rup main bhi dhokheybaaj thim
 Much of the confusion arising from them comes from their ability to sit on both sides of the boundaries of drama between reality and the supernatural
 ve donon duniya main itani gaharaai se surakshit hai ki yah spasht nahin hota he ki ve bhagya ko niyantrit karti hai yaa kya ve sirf iske agent hai
 They defy logic by not being subject to real-world rules
 pehali bhoomika main chudilon kii panktiyaan: "sachaai beyimaani he or beyimaani uchit he: kohre or dooshit hawa ke aasapaas se hokar jaao" ise aksar ek bhram kii bhaavana ke rup main vyavasthit karte hue naatak ke baaki hisse ke liye ek nirdhaarit tone kaha jaataa he
 In fact, the play is full of situations where wickedness is portrayed as good while good is portrayed as wicked
 pankti "doharaa, doharaa parishram or musiibat," chudilon kii manshaa kaa spasht rup se sandesh detii he: ve apane aasapaas ke manushyon ke liye keval musiibat chaahati hai
 While Chudells does not directly tell Macbeth to kill King Duncan, she uses a subtle form of seduction when she tells Macbeth that he is destined to be king
 uske man main is vichaar ko sthapit kar ve uske apane vinaash ke maarg ke par prabhavi rup se nirdeshit karti hai
 It follows a method of seduction that many believe to be the devil used in Shakespeare's time
 unhone tark diya ki sabase pehle kisi vyakti ke man main ek vichaar bhar diya jaataa he, phir vah vyakti yaa to is vichaar main lipt ho jaataa he yaa ise asweekaar kar detaa he
 Macbeth indulges in it while Banquo dismisses it

 Shakespeare's audience must have immediately picked these up and examining further parallels between the play and the Bible provides additional insight into Shakespeare's intentions for this writing

 For example, "the Scottish Play", or "maccabee", or when referring to the character and not the play, use of "mr and Mrs M" or "the Scottish King"

 Thus the use of the name of a play inside a theater is considered disastrous until the failure of the production and can possibly cause physical injury or death to members of the acting class
 makebeth ke sanchaalan ke dauraan durghatnaon, durbhaagyon or yahan tak ki maut kii ghatnaon kii kahaniyaan maujuud hai
 a special incident that linked itself to this superstition was the riot of Astor Place
 Because the cause of these riots was based on a conflict between two acting performances of Macbeth, it is often thought to have been caused by the curse
 abhinayta ke aadhaar par is abhishaap ko mitaane ke liye kai tareeke maujuud hai
 One way to relate to Michael York is to immediately leave the building where the stage is made, with the person who has pronounced the name, walk around it three times, spit on his left shoulder, say an obscenity and Then wait to be invited back to the building
 ek sambandhit abhyaas jitani teji se sambhav ho us sthaan par teen baar chaaron ore ghoomana, jiske saath kabhi-kabhi unke kandhon par thukna or ek ashleel baat kahana he
 Another popular "custom" is to leave the room, knock three times, be invited, and then speak a line to Hamlet
 In addition, another custom is to recite the lines of The Merchant of Venice, which is considered a fortunate drama
 forman ke dastauez main varnit ke alaava shakespeare ke yug ke abhinay pradarshnon kaa koi bhi udhaaharan nishchit rup se gyaat nahin he
 Because of its Scottish theme, the play is sometimes said to have been written for King James and possibly commissioned for him; However, no external evidence supports this hypothesis

 In Restoration, Sir William Davenant produced a stunning "operatic" adaptation of a Macbeth using special effects such as "all songs and dances" and "flying for witches"
 Davenant's revision had also enhanced the role of Lady Macduff, making her a thematic interruption for Lady Macbeth
 19 april 1667 ko apni diary main ek pravishti main samual pepis ne devenant ke makebeth ko "rangamanch ke liye sarvshereshth naatakon main se ek or nrity evam sangeet kii vividhta se bharpoor, jise maine kabhi dekha he" kaha

 Famous Macbaths such as James Queen of the early 18th century used this version

 Macklin acted in a Scottish costume that contrasted with the earlier practice of costuming Macbeth as an English brigadier; He had also removed Garrick's death dialogues and further cut off the role of Lady Macduff
 is abhinay ko aam taur par sammanjanak samikshaayen praapt huin, haalanki jorge steevence ne bhoomika ke liye maclin qi anupyuktata par tippanee kii thi
 The most admired Macbeth of the 18th century after Garrick was John Philip Kemble; She played the role most popularly with her sister, Sarah Siddons, whose Lady Macbeth is considered the best

 The reaction to Kemble's interpretation was divided; However, Siddons was unanimously praised

 His successor as London's leading actor, Edmund Keane, is often criticized for his extreme sentiment, especially in the fifth role
 keen ke makebeth kii saarvbhaumik rup se prashansa nahin kii gayi thi, udhaaharan ke liye, wiliam hazlit ne yah shikaayat kii thi ki keen kaa mickbeth unke richard III ke kaaphi samaan tha
 As he did in other roles, Keane used his betting to be a key component of Macbeth's mental decline
 unhone camble dwaara makebeth ke ek sabhy rup par jor die jane ke vipareet isaki jagah use ek krur rajaneta ke rup main prastut kiya jiskaa aparaadh or bhay ke bhaar se patan ho jaataa he
 Keane, however, did nothing to stop the growing trend towards extravagance in scenes and costumes

 makerady ne 1820 main kovent garden main apni bhoomika kii shuruyaat kii thi
 As noted by Hazlitt, macready's textual content about this character was purely psychological; The witches had lost all their supernatural powers, and Macbeth's downfall began purely from the conflict in Macbeth's character
 makerady kii sabase prasiddh ladi makebeth thi helena fosit jinhone is bhoomika main apni shuruyaat us samay niraashajanak dhang se kii thi jab vah apane 20wein dashak main thi, lekin baad main unhone ek aisi vyakhaaya ke liye prashansa praapt kii jo sidans ke vipareet, mahila kii maryaada ke samakaleen bhaavon ke anuroop thi
 He continued to act in the role after Macready "retired" to the US; In 1849 he became involved in a rivalry with American actor Edwin Forrest, whose partisanship pushed Macready to Astor Place, leading to an event commonly known as Astor Place Right

 Both are more famous for their interpretations of this character than for certain aspects of staging

 Olivier's makeup was so thick and stylish for the presentation that Vivian Leah was quoted as saying "you hear the first line of Macbeth, then Larry's makeup comes out, and then Banquo, then Larry comes is"
 Olivier would later play the role that is most famous among 20th century productions, staged by Glen Byam Shaw in 1955 in stratford-upon-avon

 navyan buddha dharm kaa ek sampradaay hai, jo bhartiya buddha netaa bhimrao ambedkar dwaara nirmit hai
 Navayana means "new path" or "pure vehicle"
 is buddha dharm ke saare anuyaayi "ambedakarwaadi buddha" hote hai, in baudhon kaa ambedkar dwaara nirdharit baees pratigyaaon kaa paalan anivaary tathaa mahatvapurn mana jaataa hai, jo ambedkar ne 14 aktubar 1956 ke dharm parivartan samaaroh di thi
 These convert Buddhist followers of Ambedkar have been named as "navabodh" by the Government of India and other state and state governments
 navyan sampradaay mahayan, therwaad or vajrayan aadi kuch maamalon main bhinn hai kintu isamen in teenon sampradaayon main se buddha ke mul siddhanto ke saath keval vigyaanvaadee evam tarkshuddh / tarksangat siddhanton ko hi liya gaya hai
 Caste system, apartheid, gender discrimination, superstition and malpractices have no place in the Navayana
 2011 ke anusaar, kul bhartiya baudhon main adhikansh yani 87% hissaa navayani baudhon kaa hai
 According to other estimates, the population of Navyani Buddhists in India ranges from 5 to 7 crores in India
 ambedkar ko buddha dharm kaa swikaar karne se ek din purv patrkaar ne poocha kii, ‘aap jo buddha dharm apnaane vaale he wo mahayan buddha dharm hoga yaa hinayan buddha dharm ?’ uttar main ambedkar ne kaha kii, ‘‘meraa buddha dharm na to mahayan hoga or na hi hinayan hogaan, in donon sampradaayon main kuch andhvishwasi baaten hai isliye meraa ye buddha dharm navyan buddha dharm honga
 In which the basic principles of a Buddha and only the rational principles will be there, there will be no malicious or superstitious beliefs
 yah ek ‘shuddh buddha dharm’ honga
 The journalist then asked, "can we call it 'bhimayan'?" Ambedkar said, you can say but i will not say
 kyonki main khud ko gautam buddha ke samaan nahin laana chahta
 However, the Buddhist elements of Indian Navyani Buddhism pay respect to Ambedkar and Gautama Buddha, because they consider Ambedkar as their spiritual leader and Buddha as their mentor
 vartmaan bharat main jab-jab bhagwaan buddha ko samaran kiya jaataa he, tab-tab swaabhaavik rup se bhimrao ambedkar kaa bhi naam liya jaataa he
 After Indian independence a large number of communal Buddhist Dhamma converts took place under the leadership of Dr
 Ambedkar
 14 aktubar, 1956 ko nagpur main yah diksha sampann hui, jisamen ambedkar ke 5,00,000 samarthak buddha bane he, agle din 2,00,000 evam tisare din 16 oktober ko chandrapur main 3,00,000 anuyaayi buddha bane
 In this way, more than 10 lakh people had made Ambedkar a Buddhist in just three days

 Our Buddhism is a new Buddhism, Navayana
 — dow bhimrao ambedkar, shaam hotel, nagpur main 13 oktober 1956 ko press saakshaatkaar Dalits are beginning to think that the exit from Hinduism may be a better way for them as the condition of the new Buddhists has improved over the years, while the life of Hindu Dalits has not changed much despite being organized as a vote bank

 According to the 2001 census, the population of Buddhists in the country is eight million, most of which are converted from Buddhists to Hindu Dalits
 sabase adhik 59 lakh buddha maharashtra main bane hai

 This is in accordance with the high status of women in Buddhist society
 baudhon kaa yah anupaat hinduon, musalamaanon, sikh or jain kii tulana main adhik he
 According to the 2001 census, the sex ratio of girls and boys among Buddhists is 942, higher than the 938 for Hindu Dalits
 yah ling anupaat hinduon, sikh kii tulana main bahut adhik he, or jain 
 It is in comparison with Hindu Dalit families that girls are the result of better care and protection among Buddhists
 buddha anuyaayion kii sakshartaa dar 72
7 pratishat he jo hindu daliton kii tulana main bahut adhik he
 Even at this rate, it is more than that of Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs, it is found that Buddhism is more literate than Hindu Dalits
 buddha mahilaon kii sakshartaa dar ke rup main hindu dalit mahilaon ke 41
9 pratishat kii tulana main 61
7 pratishat he
 This rate is also higher than Hindus and Muslims
 yah buddha samaaj main mahilaon kii sthiti ke anusaar he
 This suggests that women among Buddhists are becoming more educated than Hindu Dalit women
 baudhon ke liye yah dar 40
6 pratishat sabase adhik he jo hindu daliton ke liye adhik se adhik 40
4 pratishat he
 This rate is also higher than Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, and Jains
 yah sabit karata he ki buddha dharm hindu daliton se bhi adhik karyrat hai
 This shows that Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar, the leader of the exploited and downtrodden, had accepted the great Buddhism for the upliftment or progress of the Dalits
 tathaa anyo ko bhi buddhavaad sweekaar karne kii salaah di 
 And it is well established in defeating Dalits
 haalanki, aaj daliton ke chote hisse ne hi buddhavaad apanaaya hai, or ye buddha samooh hindu daliton se behatar or sabase behatar ban rahaa hai
 More than 95% of Indian Buddhists are Navyani Buddhists

 Traditions of Buddhism left a deep impact on Chinese culture and civilization for nearly two thousand years, these Buddhist traditions can be seen in Chinese art, politics, literature, philosophy and medicine

 The religion of many great dynasties prevailed before Buddhism in ancient China
 unamem se ek sha rajvansh tha, jo 2070 isa purv tha
 Prior to the Sha dynasty, China had a period of three overlords and five emperors

 Shun entrusted his throne to Yu Mahan and from that the Sha dynasty came to power
 ise shiya rajvansh bhi kaha jaataa tha jiske baad shang rajvansh kaa daur aayaa, jo 1600 isapurv se 1046 isapurv tak chalaa

 The Zhou dynasty in China lasted a long time

 Later Taoism, Mohism and Judaism also flourished
 lekin in sabhi ke bich buddha dharm ne apni jaden jamaain or isane china kii bhinn-bhinn vichaardhaaraon ko ek sutara main baandh diya
 Buddhism led to the development of caste unity and power in China
 is vichaardhaara ke failane ke kaaran china main daspratha ke khatme ke saath hi chhin rajvansh kaa udai hua
 Han reigned after the Chhin until the 8th century
 in sabhi rajwanshon or dharm va darshan ke vikaas ke purv kaal main china kaa naam harivarsh tha
 According to Indian scriptures, it was called Harivarsha
 jambudeep ke raja agnighra ke 9 putr hue- naabhi, kimpurush, harivarsh, ilaavruth, ramya, hiranyamay, kuru, bhadraashv or ketumal
 King Agnighra gave all those sons famous plots in his name
 harivarsh ko mila aaj ke china kaa bhaag, jo pracheen bhugol ke anusaar jambudweep kaa ek bhaag yaa varsh tha
 The mention of Harivarsha is found in the Jaina] sutra scripture 'jambudweep Prajnapti' and 'vishnu Purana' of Hindus

 Possibly before that, but through kings, it had become in a position to become a monarchy of China around the first century
 dhire-dhire buddha dharm ke kaaran china main rashtriya ekta sthapit hone lagi
 The feuds of the dynasties began to subside

 Taoism began in the second century BCE
 tao dharm main prakritik aradhana hoti he or itihaas main uski bahut-si shakhaaen thim
 Towards the end of its development, Taoism gradually divided into two major sects
 ek he- aanchanatao panth or doosraa he- chad yitao panth
 Jin has a great influence in the Han race of China

 Presently, the dominance of English journalism in Hindi journalism has been abolished
 pehle desh-videsh main angreji patrakarita kaa dabadabaa tha lekin aaj hindi bhashaa kaa jhandaa chanhudish laharaa rahaa he
 May 30 is celebrated as 'hindi Journalism Day'
 bharatvarsh main aadhunik dhang kii patrakarita kaa janm atharahavin shatabdi ke chaturth charan main kalakatta, bombai or madras main hua
 Hicke's "calcutta Gazette", published in 1780 AD, was perhaps the first attempt in this direction
 hindi ke pehle patr udant maartand ke prakashit hone tak in nagaron kii angloindian angreji patrakarita kaaphi viksit ho gai thi
 In these last years, journalism was also born in the Persian language
 18veen shatabdi ke farsi patr kadachit hastlikhit patr the
 In the compilation titled 'hindusthan Intelligence Oriental Anthology' published in 1801, there were quotes from how many "newspapers" in North India
 1810 main maulavee ikraam ali ne kalakatta se litho patr "hindostani" prakashit karnaa aarambh kiya
 In 1816 Gangakishore Bhattacharya introduced the "bengal Gazette"
 yah pehla bangala patr tha
 Later priests of Shrirampur gave birth to the famous propaganda "samachar Darpan"
 in praarambhik patron ke baad 1823 main hamen banglaa bhashaa ke 'samacharchandrika' or "samvaad kaumudi", farsi urdu ke "jaame jahannuma" or "shamsul akhbaar" tathaa gujarati ke "mumbai samachar" ke darshan hote hai
 It is clear that Hindi journalism is not much later
 dilli kaa "urdu akhbaar" or marathi kaa "digdarshan" hindi ke pehle patr "udant martand" ke baad hi aae
 The editor of "udant Martand" was Pandit Jugalkishore
 yah saptahik patr tha
 The language of the letter used to be Pachhihi Hindi, which the editors of the letter called "madhya Pradesh language"
 yah patr 1827 main band ho gaya
 In those days it was impossible to carry any letter without government assistance
 company sarkaar ne mishnariyon ke patr ko dak aadi kii suvidha de rakhi thi, parantu cheshtaa karne par bhi "udant martand" ko yah suvidha praapt nahin ho saki
 From 1826 AD to 1873 AD, we can call the first phase of Hindi journalism
 1873 i
 main bharatendu ne "harishchandra magazine" kii sthapana kii
 a year later the letter became famous as "harishchandra Chandrika"
 vaise bharatendu kaa "kavivachan sudhaa" patr 1867 main hi saamne aa gaya tha or usne patrakarita ke vikaas main mahatvapurn bhaag liya tha; parantu nai bhashastyli kaa pravartan 1873 main "harishchandra magazine" se hi hua
 Most of the letters in the meantime can only be called experiments and there is no knowledge of journalism behind them or the spirit of propagating new ideas
 "udant martand" ke baad pramukh patr hai : Some of these letters were monthly, some weekly
 dainik patr keval ek tha "samachar sudhavarshan" jo dwibhashiya tha or kalakatta se prakashit hota tha
 This daily paper continued till 1871
 adhikansh patr agra se prakashit hote the jo un dinon ek bada shikshacendre tha or vidhyaarthismaj kii aavashyaktaaon kii purti karte the
 The rest were related to Brahmasamaja, Sanatana Dharma and missionary work
 bahut se patr dwibhashiya the or kuch to panchabhaashiya tak the
 This also informs the immature condition of journalism
 hindipradesh ke praarambhik patron main "banaras akhbaar" kaaphi prabhaavshaalee tha or usee kii bhashaniti ke virodh main 1850 main taramohan maitra ne kaashi se saptahik "sudhakar" or 1855 main raja lakshmanasingh ne agra se "prajahitaishi" kaa prakaashan aarambh kiya tha
 When King Shivaprasad's "banaras Newspaper" adopted the Urdu language style, both these letters tended towards the Panditau Tasampradhan style
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki 1867 se pehle bhashastyli ke sambandh main hindi patrkaar kisi nishchit style kaa anusaran nahin kar sake the
 This year 'kavi Vedasudha' was published and in a way we can call it the first important letter
 pehle yah masik tha, phir pakshik hua or ant main saptahik
 Bhartendu's multiple personality was published through this paper, but the truth is that till the publication of "harishchandra Magazine", he too appears to find a path in the field of language and ideas
 hindi patrakarita kaa doosraa yug 1873 se 1900 tak chalata he
 At one end of this era was Bharatendu's "harishchandra Magazine" and "saraswati", approved by the Nagri Pracharini Sabha
 in 27 varshon main prakashit patron kii sankhya 300-350 se upar he or ye nagpur tak faile hue hai
 Most of the letters were monthly or weekly
 masik patron main niabandh, naval katha, vaarta aadi ke rup main kuch adhik sthaayee sampatti rahati thi, parantu adhikansh patr 10-15 prishthon se adhik nahin jate the or unhen ham aaj ke shabdon main "vichaarpatr" hi kah sakate hai
 News and commentaries also had an important place in the weekly papers
 vastav main dainik samachar ke prati us samay vishesh aagrah nahin tha or kadachit isiilie un dinon saptahik or masik patr kahin adhik mahatvapurn the
 He took a very important part in the public awakening
 unnisvin shatabdi ke in 25 varshon kaa adarsh bharatendu kii patrakarita thi
 Bharatavandu as "kavikavashasudha", "harishchandra Magazine", Sri Harishchandra Chandrika ", Balabodhini led in this direction
 unki tikatippaniyon se adhikri tak ghabaraate the or "kavivachansudha" ke "panch" par rusht hokar kaashi ke magistrate ne bharatendu ke patron ko shiksha vibhaag ke liye lenaa bhi band kara diya tha
 There is no doubt that even in the field of journalism, Bharatendu was completely fearless and encouraged new letters
 "hindi pradeep", "bharatjivan" aadi anek patron kaa namakaran bhi unhone hi kiya tha
 All the journalists of his era considered him a pioneer
 bharatendu ke baad is kshetra main jo patrkaar aae unamem pramukh the pandit rudradutt sharma,, baalkrishna bhatta, durgaaprasad mishra, pandit sadanand mishra, pandit vanshidhar, badrinarayan choudhary "premadhan", devakinandan treepathi, radhacharan goswami, pandit gauridatt, raaj rampal singh, pratapanarayan mishra, ambikadutt vyas,, babu ramakrishna verma, pan

 In 1895, the publication of "nagri Prapacharini Patrika" begins
 is patrika se gambhir sahityasamiksha kaa aarambh hua or isliye ham ise ek nishchit prakashastambh maan sakate hai
 With the revision of "saraswati" and "sudarshan" in 1900 AD, this second era of Hindi journalism comes under fire
 in 25 varshon main hindi patrakarita anek dishaao main viksit hui
 Initial letters were limited to teaching and preaching
 bharatendu ne saamaajik, raajnneetik or saahitiyik dishaaen bhi viksit kin
 He was the first woman to run a monthly letter called "balabodhini"
 kuch varsh baad mahilaon ko swayan is kshetra main utarate dekhte hai - "bharatbhagini", "sugruhinee" 
 Aryasamaj and Sanatan Dharma preachers were particularly active in the field of religion in these years
 brahmsamaj or radhaswami mat se sambandhit kuch patr or mirzapur jaise isai kendron se kuch isai dharm sambandhi patr bhi saamne aate hai, parantu yug kii dharmik pratikriyaaon ko ham aryasamaj ke or puranikon ke patron main hi pate hai
 Today these letters may not seem so important, but there is no doubt that they reinforced the prose style of Hindi and also sparked new ideas in public
 in dharmik vadavivaadon ke falswaroop samaaj ke vibhinn varg or sampradaay sudhaar kii ore agrasar hue or bahut sheeghra hi sampradayik patron kii baadh aa gai
 Hundreds of different ethnic and class papers were published and he spoke to innumerable people
 aaj vahi patr hamaari itihaetana main vishesh mahatvapurn hai jinhone bhashaa style, sahitya athwa raajnneeti ke kshetra main koi apratim kaary kiya ho
 Literally "hindi Pradeep", Brahmin, Kshatriya Patrika, Anandakadambini, Bharatendu, Devanagari Preacher, Vaishnav Patrika, Poet painter, Nagari Neerad, Sahitya Sudhanidhi and politically Bharatamitra, proper speaker, Sara Sudhanidhi, Bharatodaya, India life, Bharatodaya, Well-wishers and Hindi Bangwasis are particularly important
 in patron main hamaare 19veen shatabdi ke sahityarsikon, hindi ke karmath upaskon, shaileekaron or chintakon kii sarvshereshth nidhi surakshit he
 It is a matter of anger that we could not save this important material from the files of letters
 baalkrishna bhatta, pratapanarayan mishra, sadaanan mishra, rudradutt sharma, ambikadutt vyas or balmukund gupt jaise sajiv lekhakon kii kalam se nikle hue na jane kitne niabandh, tippanee, lekh, panch, haas parihaas aup sketch aaj main hamen alabhya ho rahe hai
 Even today our journalists can learn a lot from them
 apane samay main to ve agrani the hi
 Twentieth-century journalism is relatively close to us, and much of the diversity and polymorphism of journalism is found in it
 19veen shatee ke patrakaron ko bhashaa-shailishetra main avyavashtha kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 He had to place his object in front of letters in English and Urdu on the other hand
 abhi hindi main ruchi rakhanevaali janata bahut choti thi
 Gradually the situation changed and we find Hindi papers leading in the field of literature and politics
 is shatabdi se dharm or samajasudhar ke andolan kuch peeche pad gaye or jaateey chetana ne dhire-dhire rashtriya chetana kaa rup grahan kar liya
 As a result, most of the papers went with literature and politics
 saahitiyik patron ke kshetra main pehle do dashakon main acharya dvivedi dwaara sampadit "saraswati" kaa netritv rahaa
 In fact, in these twenty years, the monthly letters of Hindi emerged as a great literary force
 shrunkhalit upanyaas kahani ke rup main kai patr prakashit hue - jaise upanyaas 1901, hindi navil 1901, upanyaas lahari 1902, upanyasasagar 1903, upanyaas kusumanjali 1904, upanyasbahar 1907, upanyaas prachaar 19012
 Many letters began to come out in the last years of the nineteenth century with only poetry or problematics
 ve chale rahe
 Publication of "critic" and "history" related to historical research are also important events in the field of criticism
 parantu saraswati ne "mislani" ke rup main jo adarsh rakhaa tha, vah adhik lokapriy rahaa or is shrenee ke patron main uske saath kuch thode hi patron kaa naam liya ja saktaa he, jaise "bharatendu", nagari hitaishini patrika, bankipur, nagariprachaarak, mithilamihir or indu 
 Both "saraswati" and "indu" are important for the history of Hindi literature and in a way we can call them the apex of literary journalism of that era
 "saraswati" ke madhyam se acharya mahaviraprasad dvivedi or "indu" ke madhyam se pandit rupanarayan pandeya ne jis sampadakeey satarkta, adhyavsaay or eemaandaaree kaa adarsh hamaare saamne rakhaa vah hindi patrakarita ko ek nai disha dene main samarth hua
 But Hindi journalism could not get leadership in political field
 pichley yug kii raajnneetik patrakarita kaa centre kalakatta tha
 But Calcutta used to stay away from Hindi region and Hindi state itself got a conscious leadership in political direction in a short time
 hindi pradesh kaa pehla dainik raja rampalasinh kaa dwibhashiya "hindustan" he jo angreji or hindi main kalaakankar se prakashit hota tha
 Two years later, Babu Sitaram started extracting a daily letter called "bharatodaya" from Kanpur
 parantu ye donon patr dirghajivi nahin ho sake or saptahik patron ko hi raajnneetik vichaardhaara kaa vaahan bananaa padaa
 In fact, in the nineteenth century, Bharat Mitra, Vangwasi, Sarasudhanidhi and proper speaker of Calcutta represented the royal spirit of the Hindi state
 inamen kadachit "bharatamitra" hi sabase adhik sthaayee or shaktishaalee tha
 In the nineteenth century, Bengal and Maharashtra were centers of folk awakening and these provinces were also pioneers in radical national journalism
 hindi pradesh ke patrakaron ne in praanton ke netritv ko sweekaar kar liya or bahut dinon tak unka swatantra raajnneetik vyaktitv viksit nahin ho sakaa
 Nevertheless, we find many advances in Hindi political journalism in the form of "abhyudaya", "pratap", "karmayogi", "hindi Kesari" etc
 pratham mahayuddh kii uttejnaa ne ek baar phir kai dainik patron ko janm diya
 "calcutta News", "swatantra" and "vishwamitra" were published from Calcutta, "venkateswara Samachar" from Bombay started publishing its daily edition and "vijay" came out from Delhi
 1921 main kaashi se "aaj" or kanpur se "vartmaan" prakashit hue
 Thus we see that in 1921 Hindi journalism once again takes turns and starts its new life in the political arena
 hamaare saahitiyik patron ke kshetra main bhi nai pravritiyon kaa aarambh isi samay se hota he
 As a result, the first twenty years of the twentieth century can be called the third phase of Hindi journalism
 1921 ke baad hindi patrakarita kaa samasamyik yug aarambh hota he
 In this era, we find national and literary consciousness flourishing together
 isi samay ke lagbhag hindi kaa pravesh vishvavidhyalayon main hua or kuch aise kriti sampadak saamne aae jo angreji kii patrakarita se purnat: parichit the or jo hindi patron ko angreji, marathi or banglaa ke patron ke samakaksh laana chaahate the
 As a result, a new era in literary journalism began
 rashtriya andolanon ne hindi kii rashtrabhasha ke liye yogyata pehali baar ghoshit kii ore jaise-jaise rashtriya andolanon kaa bal badhane laga, hindi ke patrkaar or patr adhik mahatv paane lage
 After 1921, the national movement under Gandhiji's leadership did not remain confined to the middle class and reached the villagers and workers, and in this spread Hindi journalism gave significant additions
 sach to yah he ki hindi patrkaar rashtriya andolanon kii agr pankti main the or unhone videshi satta se datakar morcha liya
 Many times the foreign government fudged the freedom of newspapers by enacting new laws, but in spite of jail, fines and many mental and economic difficulties, Hindi journalists lit the lamp of free thought
 1921 ke baad sahityakshetra main jo patr aae unamem pramukh hai- In fact, there can be no doubt in the maturity and diversity of our monthly literature
 hindi kii anekanek pratham shrenee kii rachanaayen masikon dwaara hi pehle prakaash main ai or anek shreshth kavi or sahityakar patrakarita se bhi sambandhit rahe
 Today, our monthly letters cover all the parts of life and literature and now attention is also being paid to expertise
 sahitya kii pravritiyon kii jaisi vikasman jhalak patron main milti he, waisi pustakon main nahin milti
 There we find an active, vigorous, dynamic form of literature
 raajnneetik kshetra main is yug main jin patrapatrikaon kii dhooma rahi ve hai - Most of them are weekly, but their contribution to the creation of public has been significant
 jahaan tak patr kala kaa sambandh he vahaan tak ham spasht rup se kah sakate hai ki tisare or chauthe yug ke patron main dharti or akaash kaa antar he
 Today, editing is really high quality art
 raajnneetik patrakarita ke kshetra main "aaj" or uske sampadak swargeey baburao vishnu paradkar kaa lagbhag vahi sthaan he jo saahitiyik patrakarita ke kshetra main acharya mahaviraprasad dvivedi ko praapt he
 The truth is that "aaj" has done the work of a great institution in the field of journalism and it has given a number of editors and journalists to Hindi
 aadhunik sahitya ke anek angon kii bhanti hindi patrakarita bhi nai koti kii he or usamen bhi mukhyat: hamaare madhyavitt varg kii saamaajik, saanskrithik, saahitiyik ou raajnneetik hulchalon kaa pratibimb bhasvar he
 In fact, the true history of the last 200 years can only be compiled from our letter sheets
 banglaa ke "kaler katha" granth main patron ke avataranon ke aadhaar par bengal ke unnisvin shatabdi ke madhyavittiya jivan ke akalan kaa praytn hua he
 Such an effort is also desirable in Hindi
 ek tarah se unnisvin shatee main sahitya kahi ja sakanevaali cheez bahut kam he or jo he bhi, vah patron ke prishthon main hi pehle-pahal saamne ai he
 The contribution of letters has been very important in the formulation of linguistic style and the development of ethnic styles, but by the end of the first two decades of the twentieth century, only monthly letters and weekly letters have been giving birth to and developing our literary tendencies
 dvivedi yug ke sahitya ko ham "saraswati" or "indu" main jis prayogtmak rup main dekhte hai, vahi us sahitya kaa asli rup he
 After 1921 AD, literature started to stand on its own feet, independent of many leaflets, but for specific literary movements, we have to reverse the pages of the monthly papers
 raajnneetik chetana ke liye to patrapatrikas hai hi
 In fact, it is impossible to reach such a large population of pure literature as the number of journalists touches a large population
 90 ke dashak main bhartiya bhashaaon ke akhabaaron, hindi patrakarita ke kshetra main amar ujaalaa, dainik bhaskar, dainik jaagran aadi ke nagaron-kasbon se kai sanskaran nikalne shuru hue
 Where newspapers were first published from metros, new technology that came after globalization, better roads and access to traffic resources made it easier to print city editions even from small towns and towns
 saath hi in dashakon main gramin ilaakon, kasbon main failte bazaar main nayi vastuon ke liye naye upabhoktaaon kii talash bhi shuru hui
 Hindi newspapers have emerged as a means of dissemination of these items
 saath hi saath akhabaaron ke in sanskarnon main sthaneey khabaron ko pramukhataa se chapa jaataa he
 This has greatly increased the readership of newspapers
 media visheshgy sevanti ninaan ne ise 'hindi kii saarvajanik duniya kaa punarvishkaar' kaha he
 She writes, "print media has expanded the existing public world of Hindi at the district level by coverage of local events and also inadvertently reinvented it by local editions of newspapers
 1990 main rashtriya pathak surveykshan kii report bataati thi ki paanch aguva akhabaaron main hindi kaa keval ek samachar patr hua karata tha
 The past has proved how fast we are growing
 is baar sabase adhik padhe jane vaale paanch akhabaaron main shuru ke chaar hindi ke hai
 Another encouraging thing is that most of the 42 cities in the IRS survey which are considered to be the fastest emerging, are from the Hindi heartland
 matlab saaf he ki agar pichley teen dashak main dakshin ke rajyon ne vikaas kii jabardast pingen badhaain to aane vaale dashak ham hindi waalon ke hai
 It is not that in the case of newspaper studies, these regions are proving to be leaders
 iti industry kaa ek aankada bataata he ki hindi or bhartiya bhashaaon main net par padhane-likhane waalon kii taadaad lagaataar bad rahi he
 Meaning is clear
 hindi kii aakankshaon kaa yah vistaar patrakaron kii ore bhi dekh rahaa he
 With the consciousness of progress, people sitting in the bottom line of society should also appear in the rows of newspapers
 pichley iees, iaiti or tamaam shiksha parishadon ke parinaamon ne sabit kar diya he ki hindi bhashiyon main sabase nichali sidhiyon par baithe log bhi jabardast oochaal ke liye taiyaar hai
 Hindi journalists will have to go one step ahead of them to regain the place which we have lost continuously over the last four decades
