 vishnu ke gunon main bhi trayaatmakataa parilakshith hoti he
 He is of three rank-order, three types of speed, measuring the three worlds and holding the Loktraya
 isi prakaar vah ‘tridhaatu’ arthath sat, raj or tam kaa samikrut rup athwa prithvi, jal or tej se yukt bhi hai
 Vishnu is the creator of earthly regions and the establishment of the most elaborate space etc
 ve swanirmit lokon main teen prakaar kii gati karne vaale hai
 These three movements symbolize their origin, status and merger
 is prakaar jad-jangam sabhi ke ve nirmaataa bhi hai, paalak bhi or vinaashak bhi
 He is the 'sole holder of Loktray'
 ve apane teen paad-prakshepon se akele hi teenon lokon ko naap lete hai
 By measuring Loktraya, it also results that Loktraya means that the entire living beings are under his complete control
 vishnu bhrun-rakshak bhi hai
 Vishnu is prayed to protect the womb seed and the birth of a beautiful child
 unke paalak swaroop par spasht bal dene ke kaaran rugveda main ahoratr agnirup main bhi unhen 'vishnurgopa paraman paati

' arthath sabake rakshak-paalak kaha gaya he
 Acharya Saiyan also clearly considers Vishnu to be 'observant' in the interpretation of the twelfth mantra of the twenty-fifth Sukta of the Eighteenth Circle of the Rigveda
 xxrep 4 
 Therefore, in the overall perspective, Vishnu has been called the supreme benefactor in the Rigveda
 sarvaadhik mantron main varnit hone ke baavjood indra ko 'sukrit' or vishnu ko 'sukruttarah' kaha gaya he
 'sukritarah' has been interpreted by Acharya Sayan as 'the best of those who give good fruit'; Shripad Satavalekar ji has given the meaning 'best among those who do good deeds' and Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati ji has also given the meaning 'ative best deeds
' indra 'sukrit' he to vishnu 'sukruttarah' hai
 The meaning is clear that it is assumed in the Rigveda that Vishnu is supreme
 isi prakaar indra ke raja hone ke baavjood vishnu kii sarvocchata rugveda main hi is baat se bhi spasht ho jaati he ki usamen vishnu ke liye kaha gaya he ki "ve sampoorn vishwa ko akele dhaaran karte hai" tathaa indra ke liye kaha gaya he ki ve rajya karte hai
 The meaning is clear that Vishnu, the creator and foster of the universe, has made Indra the king for operation
 is susandarbhit pariprekshya main vishnu kii sarvocchata se sambaddh brahman granthon evam baad kii puranic manyataayen bhi swatah udbhasith ho uthati hai
 In the Brahmin era, there was a lot of development of yajna-sanstha and with this, the importance of Vishnu in Deomandali became more than before
 aitarey brahman ke armbh main hi yajna main sthaan dene ke kram main agni se armbh kar vishnu ke sthaan ko 'param' kaha gaya he
 Among them is the place of other gods
 is tarah spasht rup se vaidic samhita granthon main sarvapramukh sthaan praapt agni kii apeksha vishnu ko atyucch sthaan diya gaya he
 In fact, Vishnu has been considered great in the Rigveda, but due to the lack of description, his place there is secondary
 brahman granthon main spasht kathan ke dwaara unhen sarvocch pad diya gaya he
 This superiority is also evident from the legend that Vishnu snatched the earth, Veda and Vani from the demons by his three steps and gave it to Indra
 vaidic vishnu ke teen pagon kaa yah brahmanon main kathatmak roopaantaran he; or isi ke saath vishnu kii sarvshereshthata bhi brahman yug main hi spasht ho gayi
 Aitareya Brahmin clearly considers Vishnu as the gatekeeper, the absolute protector of the gods
 rugveda tathaa brahmanon main uplabdh sanketon kaa puraanon main paryaapt parivardhan hua-- kathatmak bhi, vivarnaatmak bhi or vyaakhyaatmak bhi
 The Puranas have referred to Nirmal Parbrahma as Vishnu due to the absence of present, continual, unborn, Akshay, Avayya, Ekras and Hay at the core of this world
 ve 'paraanaa parah', intaraatma main avasthit paramatma, param shreshth tathaa rup, varna aadi nirdeshon tathaa visheshan se rahit hai
 They are devoid of these six vices - birth, growth, result, decay and destruction
 ve sarvatra vyaapt hai or samast vishwa kaa unheen main vaas he; isiilie vidvan unhen 'vasudev' kehete hai
 At a time when there was no day, night, sky, earth, darkness, light and nothing but these, at that time the only head man was Param Brahm, who is not the subject of senses and intellect
 sristi ke armbh main brahma ji ko vishnu ji ne jo mul gyanaswaroop chatupashloki bhagwat sunaaya tha, usamen bhi yahi bhav vyakt hua he -- sristi ke purv keval main hi main tha
 Apart from me, neither was gross nor subtle and neither was the cause of ignorance
 jahaan yah sristi nahin he, vahaan main hi main hoon or is sristi ke rup main jo prathit ho rahaa he, vah bhi main hi hoon or jo kuch batch rahegaa, vah bhi main hi hoon
 In these contexts, the supremacy of Vishnu and the feeling of being a Sarvnarshi is clearly reflected
 mana gaya he ki vishnu ke do rup hue
 The first form is the head man and the second form is 'kaal'
 ye hi donon sristi or pralay ko athwa prakruti or purush ko sanyukt or viyukt karte hai
 This time form God is eternal and eternal; Therefore, the origin, position and catastrophe of the world also never stop
 vaishnavon ke sirmaur tathaa 'puraanon kaa tilak' ke rup main maanya bhagwat mahapurana main sristi kii utpatti ke prasang main kaha gaya he ki sristi karne kii ichha hone par ekarnav main soye vishnu kii naabhi se camel kaa pradurbhaav hua or usamen samast gunon ko abhasith karne vaale swayan vishnu ke hi antaryami rup se pravisht hone se swatah vedamay brahma kaa pradurbhaav hua
 Similarly, in most Puranas, Vishnu has been accepted as the ultimate brahma
 unase sambaddh kathaon se puraana bhare pade hai
 Being a follower, they sometimes have to resort to various traps from the world view
 asuron ke dwaara rajya chin lene par punah swargadhipaty-prapti hetu devataaon ko samudr-manthan kaa paraamarsh dete hue asuron se chal karne kaa suzav dena; tathaa kamoddeepak mohini rup dharankar asuron ko mohit karke devataaon ko amrit pilaanaa; shankhachud ke vadh hetu tulsi kaa satitv bhang karne sambandhi devibhagwat tathaa shivpurana jaise uppuraanon main varnit kathaon main vishnu kaa chal-prapanch drashtavy he
 In this regard, it is important to note that being a follower, they see results
 kinhin varadaanon se asuron / anyaayiyon ke bal-vishisht ho jane ke kaaran yadi chal karke bhi anyaayi kaa ant tathaa anyaay kaa parimarjan hota he to ve chal karne se bhi nahin hichakate
 Killing Bali by hiding in Ramavatar and becoming the MLA of many tricks in the Mahabharata war in Krishnavatar is a reflection of his attitude
 chhidranveshi log inhen kathaon kaa upyog manamaani vyakhya karke ishwar-virodh ke rup main karte hai
 But it is necessary to look at them from the point of view of contextual knowledge, because in the Puranas or related texts, these passages are presented in the opposite situations only for the knowledge of specific duties beyond the ordinary
 dhyatavya he ki puraanon main tathvik gyaan ko hi brahm, paramatma or bhagwaan kaha gaya he
 The entire nature of Vishnu is cognitive
 puraanon main unke dwaara dhaaran kiye jane vaale aabhushanon tathaa ayudhon ko bhi pratikatmak mana gaya he :- In this way, Vishnu carries all the creative ingredients on his body
 vishnu kii akruti se sambandhit stutiparak ek shloke atiprasiddh he :- Shantakaran Bhujagasyanam Padmanabhan Suresham
 vishvadharan gagansadrushan megh varnan shubhangam
 
 lakshmikaantan kamalnayanan yogibhirdhyanagamyam

 Charity - whose shape is extremely calm, sleeping on the bed of Sheshnag, with a lotus in the navel, which is also the basis of God and the whole world of the gods, which pervades everywhere like the sky, similar to Neelamegh
 , Extremely beautiful whose whole parts are attained by meditating by yogis, who are masters of the whole world, who are destroyers of birth and death, such Lakshmipati, a Lnetr God Srivishnu i salute
 vishnu kii sarvshereshthata kaa yah taatpary nahin he ki shiv yaa brahma aadi unase nune hai
 God does not have a high and low sense
 vah to lila main sristi-sanchaalan hetu sagun hone kii praathamikta maatr he
 Therefore, be it Vaishnava or Shaiva - all the best texts like Purana and Mahabharata declare with one voice that God is one
 kaha gaya he ki ek hi bhagavan janardan jagat kii sristi, sthiti or sanhaar ke liye 'brahma', 'vishnu' or 'shiv' -- in teen sangyaaon ko dhaaran karte hai
 There are many clear statements of Vishnu and Shiva being the same
 'avatar' kaa shabdic arth he bhagavan kaa apni swatantry-shakti ke dwaara bhautik jagat main moort rup se aavirbhaav hona, prakat hona
 The accomplishment of an avatar is considered in two conditions - one abandons one's form and eclipses the new form by action; And the second coming in a related form after taking a new birth, in which the condition of a situation in the womb of the mother is also included
 isamen atyalp samay ke liye rup badalakar yaa kisi duusare kaa rup dharankar punah apane rup main aa janaa shaamil nahin hota
 In the well-known seventh and eighth verses of the fourth chapter of Srimad Bhagavad Gita, God himself stated that the purpose of incarnation is that - whenever the loss of religion and the iniquity are uplifted, then for the sacrifice of gentlemen and the destruction of the wicked
 i originate in different eras
 iske atirikt bhagwat mahapurana main ek vishisht or adhik udaatt prayojan kii baat kahi gayi he ki bhagavan to prakruti sambandhi vruddhi-vinaash aadi se pare achintya, anant, nirgun hai
 So if they do not reveal their lila in the form of avatar, then how would the creatures understand their non-living qualities? Therefore, for the inspiring welfare of the creatures, he revealed himself and his leela
 isliye vibhinn avatar-kathaon main kai visham sthitiyaan hai jisase jeev yah samaj sake ki paristhiti ke anusaar uchit maarg kaisaa hota he! The first systematic list of incarnations of Vishnu is available in the Mahabharata
 mahabharat ke shaantiparv main avtaron kii kul sankhya 10 bataayi gayi he :- Swan: Kurmashta Matsyaash pradurbhava Dwijottam॥ varaho narsinghsch vamano ram ev c
 Ramo Dasharthischaiv Satvakat Kalkirev Chak arthath hans kurm matsay varah narsingh vaaman parashuram dasharathanandan ram yaduwanshi shrikrishna tathaa kalki -- ye sab mere avatar hai
 It has further been said that they are all past and future incarnations
 mulpath main varnan chah avtaron kaa he :-1
varah 2
narsingh 3
vaaman 4
parashuram 5
ram 6
krishna Since the Mahabharata is a work made before the birth of Buddha or before the imagery of Buddha being incarnate; So, naturally there is no sign of Buddha anywhere in it
 uske badale hans ko avatar rup main ginaney se dash kii sankhya puri ho gayi he
 The description of the avatar in the Dakshinatya text of Mahabharata is as follows: - matsay: kurmo varahashch narsinghsch vaaman:
 Ramo Ramscha Ramsha Krishna: Kalki Cha Te Dash
 yahan purvokt avtaron main se hans ko chhodkar tisare ram arthath balram ko jod dene se dash kii sankhya puri ho gayi he
 One thing can be proved from this description that till the time of Mahabharata, no more than ten avatars were imagined; Otherwise those Das avatars would not have been called 'all incarnations of the past and the future'
 baad main anya avtaron kii bhi kalpana prachlit hui or kul avtaron kii gananaa choubees tak pahunch gayin
 Despite counting 22 and 24 avatars in the Bhagavata Mahapuran, the majority of avatars have been the Mahabharata Das
 padmapurana, lingapurana, varahapurana, matsaypurana aadi anek puraanon main samaan rup se dash avtaron kii baat hi bataayi gayi he
 The description of Agnipuran is also exactly the same sequence
 is sandarbh kaa nimnaankit shloke praayah sarvanishtha he :- Matsya: Kurmo Varaashta Narasimhoth Vamana
 raamo ramashch krishnashch buddhah kalkishch te dash
 Thus, only the avatar of Vishnu is recognized
 inke sankshipt vivaran is prakaar hai :- Apart from Dashavatar, the names of fourteen avatars are as follows: - begusarai lok sabha nirvachan kshetra bharat ke bihar rajya kaa ek lok sabha nirvachan kshetra he

 magar phir bhi maine apane man main yah kya nishchay kar liya tha ki main apane pita kaa kaary nahin sanbhaaluungaa
 At home my feet did not stop, most of my time was spent talking or running between naughty children
 meri maa ko ye ladke jaraa bhi pasand nahin the
 i would often have arguments with my mischievous friend, which was causing me to develop the quality of speaking uninterested
 main acha khaasaa netaa ban gaya tha
 Like someone older than my age, my speaking was giving me a different identity from all the children in the school
 mujhe girjaghar main hone vaali prarthana sabhaayen bahut acchhee lagati thim, atah main lambaanch ke girjaghar ke samoohjit main geet gane laga
 My human ideal was Abbott, i was always struggling to achieve this ideal
 jis tarah mere pitaaji ne bachapan main ek pujari se prerana praapt kii thi, thik vaise hi sthiti meri bhi thi
 i never got encouragement from my father, because in his eyes it was insignificant to be a skilled speaker, he always worried about my future
 ek baar pitaaji kii kitabon ko ulat-pulat kar dekhte hue mere haath kuch aisi kitaaben lageen, jinka sambandh sainik vishyon se tha
 This booklet had two sections
 padhane ke liye mere haath priy saamagree lag gayi thi
 The reading of this book created an urge in my mind to know in detail the events inculcated with military themes
 mere man main tarah-tarah ke prashn jhaad-ghumad rahe the, kyonki ek pustika main san 1870-71 ke fonsisi-german sainik vishyon se sambandhit saamagree thi
 i used to think very seriously, is there any difference between Germans living and fighting in war? What is the difference? After all, why was Austria different from this war? Are we not German citizens like other Germans? After all, why did my father and others not become allies in that war? Is there really a difference between them and us? in prashnon ke uttar khojane main meraa dimag ulajhakar rah gaya
 i was dissatisfied with the answers i found to my questions
 magar yah baat main samaj chukaa tha ki vismark ke rajya se sambandhit hone kaa saubhaahgya sabhi germanavaasiyon ko nahin mila tha
 Why it was so, it was not coming to my mind! That is why i was keen to seriously consider studying in this subject, but my father made a big debut in this field
 unki ichha thi ki main bhi unki tarah sarkari naukari praapt karun
