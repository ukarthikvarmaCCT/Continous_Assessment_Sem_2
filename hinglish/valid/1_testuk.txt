 Metro is a 2007 Hindi-language film
 saamaanya dawa yaa generik dawa vah dawa he jo bina kisi patent ke banaayi or vitarit kii jaati he
 Formulation of a generic drug may be patented but its active ingredient is not patented
 jainarik davaaiyaan gunvattta main kisi bhi prakaar ke branded davaaiyon se kam nahin hotin tathaa ye utani hi asarkaarak he, jitani kii branded davaaiyaan
 Even their quantity, side-effects, active ingredients etc
 are similar to all branded medicines
 jainarik davaaiyon ko bazaar main utaarne kaa license milane se pehle gunvattta maanakon kii sabhi sakht prakriyaaon se guzarana hota he
 For the treatment of a particular disease, it is recommended to give a chemical element / compound as a special medicine after all the research
 is tatv ko alag-alag companiyaan alag-alag naamon bechatin he
 The name of generic medicines is determined by an expert committee based on the name of the active ingredient present in that medicine
 kisi dawa kaa generik naam puure vishwa main ek hi hota he
 For example, there is a generic drug called sildenafil for the treatment of macular dysfunction
 yahi dawa fijar naamak company viagara naam se bechati he
 Most major cities have generic medical stores where only generic medicines are available
 kintu inkaa vyapak prachaar nahin hone se logon ko inkaa laabh nahin miltaa
 For any disease, the medicine that the doctor prescribes, you can get the generic medicine containing salt of the same medicine for much less than that
 keemat kaa yah antar paanch se das guna tak ho saktaa he
 The only thing is to be aware of you
 bahut kam logon ko maaloom hoga ki desh main lagbhag sabhi nami dawa companiyaan branded ke saath-saath kam keemat vaali generik dawaaen bhi banaati hai lekin zyada laabh ke chakkar main doctor or companiyaan logon ko is bare main kuch bataate nahin hai or jaankaree ke abhaav main garib bhi chemist se mahangi dawaaen kharidne ko vivash hai
 It is worth noting that after all the research for a single disease, it is recommended to give a chemical compound as a special medicine
 is yogic ko alag-alag companiyaan alag-alag naamon se bechati hai
 An expert committee determines the name of the generic drug based on the name of the active compound present in it
 kisi bhi dawa kaa generik naam puure vishwa main ek hi hota he
 Generic medicines are made and distributed without any patents, ie, the formulation of the generic drug may be patented but its contents cannot be patented
 antarrashtriya maanakon se bani generik dawaaiyon kii gunvattta branded dawaaiyon se kam nahin hoti, jinaki aapurti duniyabar main bhi kii jaati he or yah bhi utana hi asar karti hai jitna branded dawaaen karti hai
 Their dosage, side-effects, ingredients etc
 are exactly the same as all branded medicines
 udhaaharan ke liye purushon main irectile disfunction ke ilaaj ke liye sildenphil naam kii generik dawa hoti he jise fizer company viagara naam se bechati he
 Generic medicines also have to undergo all strict procedures of quality standards before being licensed to market
 in dawaaon ke prachaar-prasar par companiyaan kuch kharch nahin karti
 Generic drugs have government restrictions on pricing, so they are cheaper, while companies price patented drugs themselves, so they are expensive
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan kaa kahana he ki yadi doctor marij ko generik dawaaiyon kii salaah dene lagen to keval dhani deshon main chikitsa vyay par 70 pratishat tak kami aa jaayegi tathaa garib deshon ke chikitsa vyay main yah kami or bhi zyada hogi
 At times, there is a difference of up to ninety percent in the prices of branded and generic drugs
 jaise yadi branded dawaai kii 14 goliyon kaa ek patta 786 rupee kaa he, to ek goli kii keemat kareeb 55 rupee hui
 a leaf of 10 tablets of the same generic drug is available for just Rs 59, that is, one tablet will be available for only Rs 6
 khaas baat yah he ki kidney, urine, bern, dil sambandhi rog, neurology, diabetes jaisi bimariyon main to branded va generik dawa kii keemat main bahut hi zyada antar dekhne ko miltaa he
 Pharmaceutical companies make huge profits from branded medicine
 dawaaon kii companiyaan apane medical riprogentatica ke jariye doctoron ko apni branded dawa likhane ke liye khaase laabh detii hai
 On this basis, medicine is supplied to the nearest medical store
 yahi vajah he ki branded dawaaon kaa kaarobaar din prati din badhata ja rahaa he
 This is the reason why doctors do not prescribe generic medicine at all
 jaankaree hone par koi vyakti agar chemist kii dukaan se generik dawa maang bhi le to dawa vikreta inaki uplabdhta se inkaar kar dete hai
 Most of the big cities of the country have exclusive generic medical stores, but due to lack of wide publicity, people do not benefit from them, nowadays all kinds of information can be easily accessed through the Internet
 branded or generik dawaaon kii keemat main antar kaa pataa lagane ke liye ek mobile ap 'samaadhaan or helthcart bhi bazaar main uplabdh he
 Today, people need to know about generic medicines and especially to make the poor aware so that they do not get caught in the maze of pharmaceutical companies
 jainarik davaaiyaan branded davaaiyon kii tulana main ausatan paanch guna sasti hoti he
 The availability of generic medicines can provide a huge contribution in providing health protection to the common man and this will challenge the monopoly of branded companies in the pharmaceutical industry
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke anusaar jainarik davaaiyon ke likhe jane par keval dhani deshon main chikitsa vyay par 70 pratishat tak kami aa jaayegi tathaa garib deshon ke chikitsa vyay main yah kami or bhi zyada hogi
 Generic medicines reach the manufacturer directly from the retailer
 in dawaaon ke prachaar-prasar par companiyon ko kuch kharch nahin karnaa padataa
 The price of patents and generic drugs of the same company varies greatly
 chunki generik dawaaon ke mulya nirdhaaran par sarkari ankush hota he, at: ve sasti hoti hai, jabaki patent dawaaon kii keemat companiyaan khud tay karti hai, isliye ve mahangi hoti hai
 For example, if the doctor has prescribed the drug 'glycave' brand for a patient of blood cancer, then the cost of the month-long course will be Rs 1,14,400, whereas the cost of the month-long course of the other brand 'vineet' of the same drug
 11,400 would be relatively low

 Projectile motion is a form of motion, where the particle is projected at an angle from the horizon near the surface of the Earth and performs curvilinear motion under gravity
 prakshepya ke path ko prakshepya vakr kaha jaataa he
 The projectile motion is achieved only when here only one force is applied from the beginning of the projectile curve after which it has no effect
 yadi prakshepya ko iske praarambhik veg v0 ke saath prakshepit kiya jaataa he, to ise nimna prakaar likhaa ja saktaa he If the value of the projectile angle θ is known, the components v0x and v0y of the velocity v0 can be written as follows: If the projectile's range, launch angle, and drop height are known, launch velocity can be found by In projectile motion, horizontal motion and vertical motion are independent from each other, that is, a change in one is not affected by the other
 chunki yaha kshitij disha main koi twaran nahin he atah kshitij disha main veg kaa niyat maan ucosα he
 The speed of the projectile in the upward direction is the same as the speed of the free particle under gravity
 yahan twaran niyat he or iskaa maan g he, yah g prithvi kaa gurutveey twaran he
 : gati ke dauraan prakshepya kii kshitij veg kaa maan niyat rahegaa kyonki is disha main koi twaran nahin he
 The upward component of velocity will increase linearly, because the value of acceleration is constant
 kisi samay t par, veg ke ghatak: Velocity magnitude: samay t par, prakshepya ke kshitij va urdhv visthaapan : Hence the magnitude of displacement: nimna samikarnon main Deleting t we get the following equation: yah paravalay kii sameekaran he
 Where g, α and v0 are constant, this equation is as follows jisamen a or b niyatank hai
 This is the equation of a parabola, so the path of the projectile will be parabolic
 paravalay kii aksh urdhv hogi
 The maximum height of projectile that an object reaches is called the peak of the object's motion
 unchaai main vruddhi tab tak hogi jab v y = 0 { \ displaystyle v_{y}=0}, arthath, Time taken to reach maximum height: prakshepya kii adhiktam oonchaai: Relation in range and maximum height in the dammed plane prakshepya kii kshetij paraas d prakshepya dwaara tay kii gayi vah kshetij duuri he jab vah apni praarambhik oonchaai par aata he
 Time taken to reach the initial height: kshetij visthaapan se prakshepya kii adhiktam duuri: Hence, cos = sin) dhyaan rahe d kaa maan adhiktam hoga jab Which necessarily proves that yaa The vertical component of velocity according to the work-energy theorem: tippanee: Since the value of g is not specific the body with high velocity over g limit cannot be measured using the concept of the projectile motion

 In return, the British launched a war against Julu
 gandhi ji ne bharatiyon ko bhartee karne ke liye british adhikariyon ko sakriy rup se prerit kiya
 His argument was that Indians should cooperate in war efforts to legalize their citizenship claims
 tathaapi, angrejon ne apni sena main bharatiyon ko pad dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Despite this, he accepted Gandhiji's proposal that Indians can do voluntary work to bring wounded British soldiers to Stetcher for treatment

 isliye unhone satyagrah, kii tarj par "kafir s "

 This situation was disappointing

 Gandhiji built an ashram there where many of his supporters and new voluntary workers were organized
 unhone gaanvon kaa ek vistrut adhyayan or surveykshan kiya jisamen praaniyon par hue atyaachaar ke bhayanak candon kaa lekhajokha rakhaa gaya or isamen logon kii anutpaadakeey saamaanya avasthaa ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Creating confidence in the villagers, he started his work by cleaning the villages under which schools and hospitals were built and the rural leadership was motivated to eliminate many of the social evils mentioned above
 lekin iske pramukh prabhaav us samay dekhne ko mili jab unhen ashaanti failaane ke liye police ne giraftaar kiya or unhen praant chhodane ke liye aadesh diya gaya
 Thousands of people protested and took out rallies outside jails, police stations and courts and demanded Gandhi ji to be released unconditionally
 gandhi ji ne jameendaaron ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan or hadataalon ko kaa netritv kiya jinhone angreji sarkaar ke maargdarshan main us kshetra ke garib kisaanon ko adhik kshatipurti manjuur karne tathaa kheti par niyantran, rajasav main badhotari ko radd karnaa tathaa ise sangrahit karne vaale ek samjhaute par hastakshar kiye

 The Jallianwala massacre of Indians by the British forces in Punjab, also known as the Amritsar massacre, caused tremendous shock to the nation, which sparked a flame of anger and violence in the public
 gandhiji ne british raaj tathaa bharatiyon dwaara pratikaratmak ravaiya donon kii kii
 He expressed condolences to the British citizens and victims of the riots and condemned the riots after the initial opposition of the party
 gandhi ji ke bhaavnaatmak bhaashan ke baad apane siddhant kii vakaalat kii ki sabhi hinsa or buraai ko nyyochit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa he
 But it was with this massacre and subsequent violence that Gandhiji focused his mind on bringing complete control over the entire government and the Indian government-occupied institutions, which would soon turn into Swaraj or complete personal, spiritual and political freedom
 disambar 1921 main gandhi jo bhartiya rashtriya congress

 gandhi ji ne apane ahimsaatmak manch ko swadeshi niti — main shaamil karne ke liye vistaar kiya jisamen videshi vastuon visheshkar angreji vastuon kaa bahishkaar karnaa tha
 His advocacy associated with this was that all Indians should wear handmade khadi by our own people rather than the clothes made by the British
 gandhi ji ne swatantraaa andolan ko sahyog dene ke liepurushon or mahilaon ko pratidin khaadi ke liye soot kaatne main samay bitaane ke liye kaha
 It was a policy of bringing discipline and dedication to overcome reluctance and ambition and to replace them with women at a time when there were many ideas that such activities are not respectable for women
 iske alaava gandhi ji ne britain kii shaikshik sansthaaon tathaa adaalaton kaa bahishkaar or sarkari naukariyon ko chhodane kaa tathaa sarkaar se praapt tamagon or sammaan ko waapas lautaane kaa bhi anurodh kiya

 phir jaise hi yah andolan apane sheersh par pahunchaa vaise farvari 1922 main iskaa ant chauri-chora, uttarapradesh main bhayanak dwesh ke rup main ant hua
 In view of the fear of the movement adopting a stand of violence and considering that it would destroy all its actions, Gandhiji withdrew this movement of widespread non-cooperation

 gandhi ji ne is khai ko bahut se sadhano se bharne kaa prayaas kiya jisamen unhone 1924 kii basant main simit safalataa dilaane vaale teen saptaah kaa upwas karnaa bhi shaamil tha
 Gandhi stayed away from active politics and for most of the 1920s he continued to fill the gap between the Swaraj Party and the Indian National Congress and in addition he waged a movement against untouchability, alcoholism, ignorance and poverty
 unhone pehle 1928 main laute 
ek saal pehle angreji sarkaar ne sar jon simon ke netritv main ek nayaa samvedhanik sudhaar ayog banaaya jisamen ek bhi sadsy bhartiya nahin tha
 This resulted in a boycott by Indian political parties
 disambar 1928 main gandhi ji ne kalakatta main yojit congress ke ek adhiveshan main ek prastaav rakhaa jisamen bhartiya samrajya ko satta pradaan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha athwa aisa na karne ke badale apane uddeshy ke rup main sampurna desh kii aazaadee ke liye asahyog andolan kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar rahen
 Gandhiji not only fueled the ideas of the youth group like Subhash Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru demanding immediate independence but also stopped his own demand for one year instead of two years
 angrejon ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 
no 31 December 1929, the flag of India was hoisted in Lahore
 26 janvari 1930 kaa din lahore main bhartiya swatantraaa diwas ke rup main indian neshnal congress ne manaaya
 The day was also celebrated by almost every Indian organization

 To end the Civil Disobedience Movement, the British government agreed to release all political prisoners
 is samjhaute ke parinamswaroop gandhi ko bhartiya rashtriya congress ke ekmaatr pratinidhi ke rup main landan main yojit hone vaale golmes sammelan main bhaag lene ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya
 This conference was a great disappointment for Gandhi and the nationalists, because it was focused on Indian prices and Indian minorities rather than transferring power
 iske alaava, lard irvin ke uttaradhikari lard willington, ne rashtravaadiyon ke andolan ko niyantrit evam kuchalane kaa ek nayaa abhiyaan aarambh karadia
 Gandhi was arrested again and the government tried to prevent his followers from being influenced by Gandhi, keeping him completely away from them
 lekin, yah yukti safal nahin thi
 In 1932, through the election debate of Dalit leader and scholar scholar Dr
 Babasaheb Ambedkar , the government approved separate elections to the untouchables under a new constitution

 On 8 May 1933, Gandhiji undertook a 21-day fast of self-purification to help the Harijan movement
 yah nayaa abhiyaan daliton ko pasand nahin aayaa tathaapi ve ek pramukh netaa bane rahe
 Dr
 Ambedkar categorically condemned Gandhiji's use of the word Harijan, that Dalits are socially immature and that Indians belonging to the privileged caste have played a patriarchal role
 ambedkar or uske sahyogi dalon ko bhi mahasoos hua ki gandhi ji daliton ke raajnneetik adhikaron ko kam aank rahe hai
 Even though Gandhiji was born into a Vaishya caste, he insisted that he could raise his voice for Dalits despite a Dalit Masiha like Dr
 Ambedkar
 bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke dinon main hindustan kii saamaajik buraaiyon main main chuaachhut ek pramukh buraai thi jiske ke viruddh mahatma gandhi or unke anuyaayi sangharshrat rahete the
 At that time the entry of Harijans into the major temples of the country was completely restricted
 kerala rajya kaa janapad trishur dakshin bharat kii ek pramukh dharmik nagari he
 There is an iconic temple here, Guruvayur Temple, in which the statue of Lord Guruvayurappan, showing the form of Lord Krishna, is installed
 aazaadee se purv anya mandiron kii bhaanti is mandir main bhi harijanon ke pravesh par purna pratibandh tha
 The pro-gandhi supporter of Kerala, Mr
 Kelappan, raised his voice against this practice under the orders of the Mahatma and finally civil disobedience was started in 1933
 mandir ke trustiyon ko is baat kii taakid kii gayi ki naye varsh kaa pratham diwas arthath 1 janvari 1934 ko antim nishchay diwas ke rup main manaaya jaayegaa or is tithi par unke str se koi nishchay na hone kii sthiti me mahatma gandhi tathaa shri kelppan dwaara aandolankariyon ke paksh main aamaran anshan kiya ja saktaa he
 For this reason, the meeting of the trustees of Guruvayur temple called a meeting and received the opinion of the worshipers of the temple
 baithak me 77 pratishat upasko ke dwaara diye gayi bahumat ke aadhaar par mandir main harijanon ke pravesh ko sweekruti de di gayi or is prakaar 1 janvari 1934 se kerala ke shri guruvayur mandir main kiye gayi nishchay diwas kii safalataa ke rup main harijanon ke pravesh ko saidvantik sweekruti mil gayi
 The Guruvayur temple to which non-hindus still enter is forbidden, however the God of many religions is an ardent devotee of Lord Guruvayurappan

 When the Congress Party chose to contest elections and accepted power under the federal scheme, Gandhiji decided to resign from the membership of the party
 vah party ke is kadam se asahmat nahin the kintu mahasoos karte the ki yadi ve istipha dete hai tab bharatiyon ke saath uski lokapriyata party kii sadsyta ko majboot karne main aasaani pradaan karegi jo ab tak communiston, samaajwaadiyon, vyapaar sanghon, chaatro, dharmik netaaon se lekar vyapaar sanghon or vibhinn awaajon ke bich vidyaman thi
 This will give all of them an opportunity to listen to their own words
 gandhi ji raaj ke liye kisi party kaa netritv karte hue prachaar dwaara koi aisa lakshya siddh nahin karnaa chaahate the jise raaj ke saath asthaayee taur par rajnatik vyavastha ke rup main sweekaar kar liya jaae
 Gandhiji returned to India in 1936 with the Lahore session of the Nehru Presidency and Congress
 haalanki gandhi kii purna ichha thi ki ve aazaadee praapt karne par apana sampurna dhyaan kendrit karen na ki bharat ke bhavishya ke bare main atakalon par
 This did not prevent the Congress from adopting socialism as its objective
 1938 main raashtrapati pad ke liye chune gaye subhash bose ke saath gandhi ji ke matbhed the
 Gandhi's main points in differences with Bose were Bose's lack of commitment to democracy and lack of faith in non-violence
 bose ne gandhi ji kii aalochana ke baavjood bhi duusari baar jeet hasil kii kintu congress ko us samay chhod diya jab sabhi bhartiya netaaon ne gandhi ji dwaara lagu kiye gaye sabhi siddhaton kaa parityag kar diya gaya
 When World War II broke out in 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland
 In the beginning, Gandhi favored non-violent moral support to the efforts of the British, but other Congress leaders opposed the unilateral inclusion in the war without consulting the representatives of the public

 congress ke sabhi chaynit sadasyon ne samuhik taur par apane pad se istipha de diya
 After a long discussion, Gandhi declared that India would not be a party to any war if it fought outside for democratic independence when India itself was denied independence
 jaise jaise yuddh badhata gaya gandhi ji ne aazaadee ke liye apni maang ko angrejon ko bharat chodo aandolan naamak vidheyak dekar teevr kar diya
 This was the most obvious rebellion of Gandhi and the Congress Party which was aimed at expelling the British from the Indian border
 gandhi ji ke duusare number par baithe jawaharlal nehru kii party ke kuch sadasyon tathaa kuch anya rajnatik bhartiya dalon ne aalochana kii jo angrejon ke paksh tathaa vipaksh donon main hi vishwaas rakhte the
 Some believed that opposing the British in their lifetime or in the struggle for death was a mortal task while some believed that Gandhiji was not doing enough
 bharat chodo is sangharsh kaa sarvaadhik shaktishaalee andolan ban gaya jisamen vyapak hinsa or giraftaar hui
 Thousands of freedom fighters were either killed or injured by police bullets and thousands were arrested
 gandhi or unke samarthakon ne spasht kar diya ki vah yuddh ke prayaason kaa samarthan tab tak nahin denge tab tak bharat ko tatkaal aazaadee na de di jaae
 He clarified that this time also this movement will not stop if individual acts of violence are materialized
 unhone kaha ki unke chaaron ore araajaktaa kaa aadesh asli araajaktaa se bhi bura he
 He asked all Congressmen and Indians to maintain discipline for ultimate freedom by doing or die with non-violence
 gandhi ji or congress kaaryakaarani samiti ke sabhi sadasyon ko angrejon dwaara mubani main 9 agast 1942 ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Gandhiji was held captive for two years at Agah Khan palace, Pune
 yahi vah samay tha jab gandhi ji ko unke nijee jivan main do gahare aghat lage
 His 50-year-old secretary Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack 6 days later and his wife Kasturba Gandhi died on 22 February 1944 after Gandhiji spent 18 months in jail
 iske chha: saptaah baad gandhi ji ko bhi malaria kaa bhayankar shikaar hona padaa
 He was released before the end of the war on 6 May 1944 due to his poor health and necessary treatment
 raaj unhen jail main dam todate hue nahin dekhnaa chaahate the jisase desh kaa krodh bad jaae
 Although the Quit India movement was a partial success in its objective, but the stubborn suppression of the movement united India by the end of 1943
 yuddh ke ant main, british ne spasht sanket de diya tha ki santta kaa hastantaran kar use bharatiyon ke haath main somp diya jayega
 At this time Gandhiji stopped the movement, which led to the release of about 100,000 political prisoners including Congress leaders
 gandhi ji ne 1946 main congress ko british kebinet mishan ke prastaav ko thukaraane kaa paraamarsh diya kyoki use muslim bahulata vaale praanton ke liye prastaavit samoohikaran ke prati unka gahan andeh hona tha isliye gandhi ji ne prakaran ko ek vibhaajan ke purvaabhyas ke rup main dekha
 However, for some time, this also became one of the incidents of differences with the Congress with Gandhiji as Nehru and Patel knew that if the Congress did not approve the plan then the control of the government would be passed on to the Muslim League
 1948 ke bich lagbhag 5000 se bhi adhik logon ko hinsa ke dauraan maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 Gandhiji was against any such scheme which divided India into two different countries
 bharat main rahane vaale bahut se hinduon or sikhon evam muslimon kaa baari bahumat desh ke bantwaare ke paksh main tha
 Additionally, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, introduced extensive cooperation in West Punjab, Sindh, North West Frontier Province and East Bengal
 vyapak str par failane vaale hindu muslim ladaai ko rokane ke liye hi congress netaaon ne bantwaare kii is yojana ko apni manjuuri de di thi
 Congress leaders knew that Gandhiji would oppose Partition and it was impossible for the Congress to move forward without his consent, because Gandhi's support in Partarthy and his position throughout India was strong
 gandhi ji ke kareebi sahyogiyon ne bantwaare ko ek sarvottam upaay ke rup main sweekaar kiya or sardaar patel ne gandhi ji ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya ki naagarik ashaanti vaale yuddh ko rokane kaa yahi ek upaay he
 Mazabur Gandhi gave his permission
 unhone uttar bharat ke saath-saath bengal main bhi muslim or hindu samudaay ke netaaon ke saath garm ravaiye ko shant karne ke liye gahan vichaar vimarsh kiya
 Despite the india-pakistan war of 1947, he was harassed when the government decided not to give Rs 55 crore to Pakistan as per the agreement made by the Partition Council
 sardaar patel jaise netaaon ko dar tha ki pakistan is dhan kaa upyog bharat ke khilaaf jang chhedane main kar saktaa he
 When the demand arose that all Muslims should be sent to Pakistan and the Muslims and Hindu leaders expressed dissatisfaction on this and Gandhiji was deeply shocked by his refusal to compromise with each other
 unhone dilli main apana pehla aamaran anshan aarambh kiya jisamen sampradayik hinsa ko sabhi ke liye tatkaal samaapt karne or pakistan ko 55 karod rou0 kaa bhugtan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 Gandhiji feared that instability and insecurity in Pakistan would increase his anger towards India and spread violence on the border
 unhen aage bhi dar tha ki hindu or muslim apni shatruta ko phir se nayaa kar denge or usase naagarik yuddh ho jane kii ashanka ban sakati he
 After a passionate debate with allies who had supported Gandhi ja throughout his life, Gandhiji refused to accept the matter and the government had to stick to its policy and make payments to Pakistan
 hindu muslim or sikh samudaay ke netaaon ne unhen vishwaas dilaayaa ki ve hinsa ko bhula kar shanti laaenge
 These communities included the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha

 He tried to learn by experimenting on his own mistakes and on his own to achieve this goal
 unhone apni aatmakatha ko satya ke prayog kaa naam diya
 Gandhi said that the most important battle to be fought is to conquer elements like your demons, fear and insecurity
 
gandhi ji ne apane vichaaron ko sabase pehle us samay sankshep main vyakt kiya jab unhone kaha bhagwaan hi satya he baad main unhone apane is kathan ko satya hi bhagwaan he main badal diya
 Thus, Gandhi's philosophy in truth is "god"

 Non-violence, non-violence and non-violence has a long history in Indian religious thought and has many concepts in its Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Jewish and Christian communities

 He was told to say: jab main niraash hota hum tab main yaad karata hum ki haalanki itihaas satya kaa maarg hota he kintu prem ise sadaiv jeet letaa he
 There have also been atrocities and assassinations here and for some time they seemed invincible but in the end their downfall happens - always consider it
 " mritkon, anaath tathaa begharon ke liye isse kya fark padataa he ki swatantraaa or loktantr ke pavitra naam ke neeche sampoornavaad kaa pagal vinaash chipa he
 One eye for another will make the whole world blind
 marane ke liye mare paas bahut se kaaran he kintu mere paas kisi ko maarane kaa koi bhi kaaran nahin he
 In applying these principles, Gandhiji did not turn away from taking them to the most logical extent to show the world where the government, police and the army also became non-violent
 " for pasifists
" naamak pustak se uddhran liye gaye hai
 The war of science leads a person to dictatorship, pure and simple

 In an interview given after the war in 1946, he presented an idea even further
 yahudiyon ko apane liye swayan kasaai kaa chaaku de dena chahie tha
 They should have thrown themselves into the sea from sea rocks
 phir bhi gandhi ji ko pataa tha ki is prakaar ke ahimsa ke str ko atoot vishwaas or saahas kii jarurat hogi or iske liye usne mahasoos kar liya tha ki yah har kisi ke paas nahin hota he
 He therefore advised everyone that they do not need to keep non-violence with them, especially when it is used for the protection of cowardice
 gandhi ji ne apane satyagrah andolan main aise logon ko dur hi rakhaa jo hathiyaar uthaane se darate the athwa pratirodh karne main swayan kii aakshamata kaa anubhav karte the
 He wrote that i believe that if one has to choose between cowardice and violence, then i will give my opinion in favor of violence

 This was due to his heir apparent curiosity in which his enthusiastic friend Sheikh Mehtab also contributed

 Before coming to London to study, Gandhiji had made a promise to his mother Putlibai and his uncle Bechariji Swamy that he would abstain from eating meat, drinking alcohol and from concussion
 unhone apane vaayade rakhane ke liye upwas kiye or aisa karne se saboot kuch aisa mila jo bhojan karne se nahin mil saktaa tha, unhone apane jivan paryant darshan ke liye aadhaar jo praapt kar liya tha
 As Gandhi became an adult he became completely vegetarian
 unhone da moral basis of vegeterionism tathaa is vishay par bahut si lekh bhi likhen hai jinamein se kuch landan vegeterian sosayadi ke prakaashan da vegeterian main prakashit bhi hue hai
 Gandhi himself was inspired by many great personalities during this period and became a friend of Dr
 Josiah Oldfield, the chairman of the London Vegetarian Society
 henry stephen salt|henry stephen salt kii kritiyon ko padhne or prashansha karne ke baad yuva mohandas gandhi shaakaahaari prachaarak se mili or unke saath patrachaar kiya
 Gandhiji spent a lot of time advocating vegetarian food while in London and thereafter
 gandhi ji kaa kahana tha ki shaakaahaari bhojan na keval sharir kii jaruraton ko puraa karata he balki yah aarthik prayojan kii bhi purti karata he jo maance se hoti he or phir bhi maance anaaj, subjiyon or falon se adhik manhagaa hota he
 Apart from this, many Indians who were struggling due to low income, who were seen as vegetarian at that time, it was not only spiritual tradition but also due to practicality
 They avoided eating for too long, and political Fasting as a protest, he refused to eat until his death
 His autobiography notes that being a vegetarian is a celibacy
 His success in total control celibacy without first ladder to re commitment, almost failed

 However, one day his uncle came to give Gandhi ji some time relief, he reached the bedroom for rest where his physical desires were awakened and he loved his wife and shortly after the servant left, the news came that Gandhi His father has just died
 Gandhiji felt a tremendous crime and he could never forgive himself for this
 This incident in m had a significant impact on Gandhi and he turned to celibacy at the age of 36, while he was married
 yah nirnay brahmacharya ke darshan se puri tarah prabhavit tha aadhyatmik or vyavhaarik shuddhta bade paimaane par brahmacharya or vairagyavaad se juda hota he

 Gandhiji believed that if a person is employed in social service, then he should move on to a more ordinary life, which he considered necessary for celibacy
 Their simplicity forced them to abandon the Western lifestyle and they were spreading to South Africa, calling it "bringing themselves to a state of zero", which required unnecessary spending, adopting a simple lifestyle and washing their own clothes
 On one occasion, he also returns the gift provided to the birthmother for his continued service to the Samudayas

 saadhaaran hindu kii tarah ve saare dharmon ko samaan rup se maanate the, or isliye unhone dharm-parivartan ke saare tarkon evam prayaason ko asweekrut kiya
 He was knowledgeable of Brahm Gyan and read all the major religions in detail
 unhone hindu dharm ke bare main nimnlikhit baaten kahi hai- Gandhi has also interpreted the Bhagavad Gita in Gujarati
 Mahadev Desai has translated the Gujarati manuscript into English with additional role and description
 It was published in 1946 with the foreword written by Gandhi
 gandhi kaa maananaa tha ki prayek dharm ke mul main satya or prem hota he
 They say that 'see the Quran', 'bible', 'jend-avesta', 'talmud', or 'gita' by any means, we all have one God, and that is the true and loving nature
 dhong, kupratha aadi par bhi unhone sabhi dharmo ke siddhanton ke prati sawalia rukh akhriyaar kiya
 He was a tireless social reformer
 unki kuch tippaniyan vibhinn dharmo ke sandarbh main is prakaar hai : Later when asked if you are a Hindu, he said: ek duusare ke prati gaharaa aadar bhav hone ke baavjood gandhi or rabindranath thakur ek se adhik baar lambi bahes main lage rahe
 These debates reflect philosophical differences between the two
 ye donon hi us samay ke prasiddh bhartiya chintak the
 In the context of the horrific earthquake that struck Bihar on 15 January 1934, Gandhiji first said in a public meeting in Tinnevalli on 24 January 1934 that even if you call me superstitious, a man like me would believe that God punished us for our sins Have sent this terrible earthquake to give
 


 bihar kaa yah sankat to keval sharir kaa naash karne vaala he, magar asprishyata-janit sankat to hamaari aatma ko nasht kar rahaa he
 Therefore, we should learn from this catastrophe of Bihar that while remaining a few short breaths, we should get rid of this stigma of untouchability and enable ourselves to appear before our Creator with a clean heart
 25 janvari ko bhi unhone logon ko is ghatana ke sandarbh main asprishyata ko mahapaap maanakar tyaagane kii prerana di tathaa 26 janvari ko madura main vyapaariyon dwaara yojit swaagat samaaroh main unhone kaha ki mujhe to yah vishwaas hota ja rahaa he ki ham par yah vipatti asprishyata ke is mahapaap ke falswaroop hi ai he
 i request you not to laugh at my words and think that i am awakening your instinct of superstition
 main aisa kuch nahin kar rahaa hoon
 


 i may be called superstitious, but what i am feeling in the depths of my heart, i cannot live without telling you
 


 yadi aap bhi meri hi tarah is baat main vishwaas karte hon to aap nirnay karne main tatparta baratenge or yah maanenge ki aaj ham jaisi asprishyata baratate hai waisi asprishyata kaa vidhaan hindu shastron main nahin he
 You will agree with my view that to consider any man untouchable is a terrible sin
 manushya kaa ahankaar hi usase aisa kahata he ki vah anya logon se shreshth he
 Ravindranath Tagore, considering Gandhiji's idea to be indiscriminate by being able to promote superstition, wrote that the definite and only root cause of physical disasters is due to the sum of certain physical facts
 


 hamaare paap athwa trutiyaan chaahe kitni bhi bhayankar kyon na hon inamen itnaa bal nahin he ki sristi ke dhaanche ko tahas-nahas kar saken
 In response to this, Gandhi ji, while clarifying his perspective in detail, wrote that i have a lively belief in the interaction of natural phenomena and human behavior happening in the universe and because of that belief, i have come closer to God, i have humility and i have become more and more ready to present myself to God
 yadi main apane ghor agyaan ke kaaran us vishwaas kaa upyog apane virodhiyon kii ninda karne ke liye karuun to nishchay hi aisa vishwaas patankaaree andhvishwaas ban jaayegaa
 Instead of making an air debate on Gandhiji and making arbitrary conclusions, it is not only an age-old requirement but also a prudence to keep in mind the authenticity of the basis of Gandhiji's beliefs
 saamaanya se vishisht tak -- sabhi sandarbhon main dastaveji rup praapt gandhi ji kaa likhaa-bolaa praayah prayek shabd adhyayan ke liye uplabdh he
 So it is naturally necessary that in view of them, something should be taken to a proper stage

 Throughout his life he has written more than Vachik

 In addition to writing many books, he also took out many magazines and wrote them well

 When he returned to India, he started a monthly magazine called 'navajivan'
 baad main navajivan kaa prakaashan hindi main bhi hua
 Apart from this, he wrote letters to individuals and newspapers almost everyday gandhi ji dwaara moulik rup se likhit pustaken chaar hai-- hind swaraj, dakshin africa ke satyagrah kaa itihaas, satya ke prayog, tathaa gita padaarth kosh sahit sampurna gita kii tikaa
