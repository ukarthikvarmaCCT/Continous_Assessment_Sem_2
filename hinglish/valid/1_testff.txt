 Rice: Tomato Rice • Pajan Kanji • Sambar Satam • Lemoner Is • Tamarind Rice • Garlic Rice • Lentil Rice • Coconut Milk Rice • vrikk yaa gurde kaa joda ek maanav ang hai, jinka pradhan kaary mutr utpaadan karnaa he
 The kidneys are found in many vertebrate animals
 ye mutr-pranali ke ang hai
 They regulate the electrolyte, alkali-acid balance and blood pressure
 inkaa mel swarup mutr kehalaata he
 It mainly consists of urea and ammonia
 gurde yugmit ang hote hai, jo kai kaary karte hai
 They are found in many types of animals, including vertebrates and some invertebrates
 ye hamaari mutr-pranali kaa ek aavashyak bhaag hai or ye electrolite niyantran, amla-kshar santulan, va raktchaap niyantran aadi jaise samasthiti kaary bhi karte he
 These act as natural purifiers of blood in the body and remove waste, which is then sent to the bladder
 mutr kaa utpaadan karte samay, gurde uria or ammonium jaise apshisht padaarth utsarjit karte hai; gurde jal, glucose or amino amlon ke punarvasoshana ke liye bhi zimmedaar hote hai
 The kidneys also produce hormones, including calcitriol, renin, and erythropoietin
 audrik guha ke pichley bhaag main retroperitonium The kidneys located in the vesicles receive blood from a pair of renal arteries and flow it into a pair of renal veins
 prayek gurda mutr ko ek mutrvahini main utsarjit karata he, jo ki swayan bhi mutrashay main rikt hone vaali ek yugmit sanrachana hoti he
 The study of kidney function is called renal physiology, while the medical method related to kidney diseases is called Meghalogy
 gurde kii bimaariyaan vividh prakaar kii hai, lekin gurde se judi bimariyon ke rogiyon main aksar vishisht chikitsiya lakshan dikhaai dete hai
 Common medical conditions associated with the kidney include nephritic and nephrotic syndromes, renal cysts, acute renal lesions, chronic kidney diseases, urethral infections, renal calculi and ureteric obstruction
 gurde ke cancer ke anek prakaar bhi maujuud hai; sabase aam vayask vrikk cancer vrikk koshika karkat he
 Cancer, cyst and some other kidney conditions can be managed by removal of the kidney, or by renal dissection
 jab gurde kaa kaary, jise kechikagucchheey shuddhikaran dar ke dwaara napa jaataa he, lagaataar buree ho, to dyalisis or gurde kaa pratyaropan iske upachaar ke vikalp ho sakate hai
 Although stones are not very harmful, they can also cause pain and problems
 pathari ko hataane kii prakriya main dhwani tarangon dwaara upachaar shaamil he, jisase pathar ko chote tukdon main todakar mutrashay ke raste baahar nikaal diya jaataa he
 Acute pain in the medial / lateral segments of the back of the back is a common symptom of appendicitis
 manushyon main, gurde udar guha main retroperitonium naamak rikt sthaan main sthit hote hai
 Their number is two and one of these kidneys is located one on either side of the spinal cord; They are approximately at the vertebral level from T12 to L3
 daayan gurda madhyapat ke thik neeche or yakrut ke peeche sthit hota he, tathaa baayan madhyapat ke neeche or pleeha ke peeche hota he
 There is an adrenal gland at the top of each kidney
 yakrut ke kaaran udar guha main pai jane vaali vishmata ke kaaran daayan gurda baayen kii tulana main thodaa neeche hota he or baayan gurda daaen kii tulana main thodaa adhik madhyam main sthit hota he
 The upper part of the kidney is partially protected by the eleventh and twelfth ribs, and the entire kidney and adrenal glands are covered by fat and renal bandage
 prayek vayask gurde kaa bhaar purushon main 125 se 170 gram ke bich or mahilaon main 115 se 155 gram ke bich hota he
 Typically, the left kidney is slightly larger than the right
 gurde kii sanrachana saim ke aakaar kii hoti he, prayek gurde main avatal or uttal satahen pai jaati hai
 The concave surface, called the renal nucleus, is the point from which the renal artery enters this organ and the renal vein and ureter exit
 gurda sakht reshedaar utakon, vrikkeey capsule se ghira hota he, jo swayan perinephric vasa, vrikk pattee tathaa paranefric vasa se ghiri hoti he
 The anterior border of these tissues is the peritoneum, while the posterior border is the transversalis bandage
 daaen gurde kii upree seemaa yakruy se satee hui hoti he; or baayin seemaa pleeha se judi hoti he
 Therefore, both of these go down when breathing
 gurda lagbhag 11-14 semi lanbaa, 6 semi chaudaa or 3 semi motaa hota he
 The substance of the kidney, or organism, is divided into two main structures: the renal bark in the upper part and the renal medulla within it
 kul milakar ye sanrachanaayen shanku ke aakaar ke aath se atharah vrikkeey khandon kii ek akruti banaati hai, jinamein se prayek main majja ke ek bhaag ko dhankane vaali vrikk chaal hoti he, jise vrikkeey pyramid kaha jaataa he
 Between the renal pyramids are bark ridges, called renal columns
 nefron, gurde kii mutr utpann karne vaali kaaryaatmak sanrachanaayen, chaal se lekar majja tak faili hoti hai
 The initial purification part of a nephron is the renal corpuscle located in the bark, followed by a renal tubule known deep into the medullary pyramids through the bark
 ek majjatmak kiran, vrikkeey chaal kaa ek bhaag, vrikkeey nalikaaon kaa ek samooh hota he, jo ek ekal sangrahan nalika main jaakar rikt hoti hai
 The end of each pyramid, or sprout, carries urine into the miniature follicle, the miniature follicle empties into the main follicles, and the main follicle empties into the renal pelvis, which becomes the urinaloid
 gurde baayin tathaa dahini vrikk dhamniyon se rakt praapt karte hai, jo sidhe audrik mahadhamani se nikalati hai
 Despite their relatively small size the kidneys receive about 20% of the blood released from the heart
 prayek vrikkeey dhamni anek khandaatmak dhamniyon main vibhajit ho jaati he, jo aage antarkhandtmak dhamniyon main bant jaati hai, jo vrikkeey capsule kaa chhedan karti hai or vrikkeey pyramidon ke bich sthit vrikkeey stambhon se hokar guzarati hai
 Subcutaneous arteries then supply blood to the arterial arteries, which are at the border of the bark and medulla
 prayek chapakar dhamni vibhinn antarkhandtmak dhamniyaan pradaan karti he, jo abhivahi dhamniyon ko bharti hai, jo glomeruli ko rakt kii aapurti karti hai
 Interstitum) is the functional space in the kidney, which is located under single fibers, which are filled with blood vessels
 interstitom mutr se punarprapt hue drav ko avashoshit kar letaa he
 Many conditions can cause scarring or blood clotting in this area, which can result in obstruction of kidney function and may even stop functioning
 shodhan kii prakriya purna ho jane par rakt shirikaon ke ek chote network se hokar guzarataa he, jo antarkhandtmak shiraaon kii ore abhisaran karti hai
 The veins also follow the same arterial distribution pattern, the afferent veins deliver blood to the umbilical veins, and from there it leads to the interdigital veins, which form the renal veins that exit the kidney for blood transfusions
 vrikkeey utak-vigyaan main gurde kii ek sookshmdarshi ke dwaara dikhaai dene vaali sanrachana kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Several distinct cell-types are found in the kidney, including the following: gurda or snaayu tantra vrikkeey jaal ke madhyam se aapas main samvaad karte hai, jiske reshe gurde tak pahunchane ke liye vrikkeey dhamniyon ke saath jude hote hai
 Input from the sympathetic nervous system induces vasoconstrictors in the kidney, causing renal blood flow to decrease
 aisa mana jaataa he ki gurde sahanukampi snaayu tantra se input praapt nahin karte
 gurde se nikalne vaale samvedak input merudand ke T10-11 staron kii ore badhata he or sambandhit antartvacha dwaara mahasoos kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, the pain felt in the armpits may be related to the kidneys
 amla-kshar santulan, electrolite sandrata, koshiketar drav maatra ko niyantrit karke or raktchaap par niyantran rakhte hue gurde puure sharir ke homeostasis main bhaag lete hai
 The kidneys perform these homeostatic functions both independently and in association with other organs, particularly the organs of the endocrine system
 in antahsravi kaaryon kii purti ke liye vibhinn antahsravi hormone ke bich talmail kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jinamein renin, angiotensis II, eldosterone, antidiauratic hormone or artial natriuratic peptid aadi shaamil hai
 Many of the functions of the kidney are accomplished by relatively simple mechanisms of refining, reabsorption and secretion that occur in the nephron
 parishodhan, jo ki vrikkeey kanika main hota he, ek prakriya he jiske dwaara koshikaayen tathaa bade protein rakt se chaane jate hai or ek ultraphiltret kaa nirmaan hota he, jo antat mutr banegaa
 gurde ek din main 180 litre ultraphiltret utpann karte hai, jiskaa ek bahut bada pratishat punarvashoshit kar liya jaataa he or mutr kii lagbhag 2 litre maatra kii utpann hoti he
 The transport of molecules from this ultrafiltrate into the blood is called reabsorption
 srav isaki vipareet prakriya he, jisamen anu vipareet disha main, rakt se mutr kii ore bheje jate hai
 Car waste materials emit
 inamen protein apachay se utpann nitrogen-yukt apshisht uria or neucleic amla ke chayapachay se utpann urik amla shaamil hai
 Any significant increase or fall in plasma osmolarity is identified by the hypothalamus, which communicates directly with the posterior mucous gland
 parasaraniyata main vruddhi hone par yah granthi antidiauratic hormone adiech kaa srav karti he, jiske parinamswaroop gurde dwaara jal kaa punarvasoshana kiya jaataa he or mutr kii sandrata bad jaati he
 These two factors work together to bring plasma osmolality back to normal levels
 adiech sangrahan nalika main sthit mukhya koshikaon se judaa hota he, jo equaporin ko majja main sthanantarit karata he, taaki jal saamanytah abhedya majja ko chhod sake or vaasa riekta dwaara sharir main iskaa punarvasoshana kiya ja sake, jisase sharir main plasma kii maatra main vruddhi hoti he
 There are two systems that create hyperpolar marrow and thus increase the amount of plasma in the body: urea recycling and 'single effect'
 uria saamanytah gurdon se ek apshisht padaarth ke rup main utsarjit kiya jaataa he
 However, when plasma blood volume is low and ADH is released, exposed aquaporins are also susceptible to urea
 isse uria ko ek hyper sangrahan nalika ko chhodkar majja main pravesh karke jal ko ‘aakarshith’ karne vaale ek hyperosmctic vilyan kaa nirmaan karne kaa mauka miltaa he
 Urea can then re-enter the nephron and be re-excreted or recycled depending on whether ADH is still present
 ‘ekal prabhaav’ is tathy kaa varnan karata he ki lups of henley kaa motaa arohi ang jal ke dwaara bhedya nahin he, lekin bhu
ni ke dwaara bhedya he
 This means that a counter-flow system is created, through which the medulla becomes more concentrated and if the collecting duct is opened by the ADH, it must be followed by a osmolarity ratio of water
 lambii-avadhi main raktchaap kaa niyantran mukhyatah gurde par nirbhar hota he
 This is mainly through the maintenance of extracellular fluid subdivision, whose size depends on the plasma sodium concentration
 haalanki, gurde sidhe hi raktchaap kaa anumaan nahin laga sakate, lekin nefron ke duurastha bhaagon main sodium or chloride kii supurdagee main parivartan gurde dwaara kiye jane vaale kinvak renin ke srav ko parivartit kar detaa he
 When the extracellular fluid subdivision is expanded and blood pressure is high, the delivery of these ions increases and the secretion of renin decreases
 isi prakaar, jab koshiketar drav upkhand sankuchit ho or raktchaap nimna ho, to sodium or chloride kii supurdagee kam ho jaati he or pratikriyaswaroop renin srav bad jaataa he
 Renin is the first member of a series of chemical messengers that together form the renin – angiotensin mechanism
 renin main hone vaale parivartan antat is tantra ke output, mukhya rup se angiotencin II or eldosteron, ko parivartit karte hai
 Each hormone acts through multiple mechanisms, but both increase the absorption of sodium chloride by the kidneys, thereby expanding the extracellular fluid subdivision and raising blood pressure
 jab renin ke str bade hue hote hai, to angiotencin II or eldosteron kii sandrata bad jaati he, jiske parinamswaroop sodium chloride ke punarvasoshana main vruddhi hoti he, koshiketar drav upkhand kaa vistaar hota he or raktchaap bad jaataa he
 Conversely, when renin levels are low, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels decrease, causing contraction of the extracellular fluid subdivision and decreasing blood pressure
 gurde anek prakaar ke hormone kaa srav karte hai, jinamein arethropitin, calcetriol or renin shaamil hai
 Erythropoietin is released as a response to hypoxia in the renal flow
 yah asthi-majja main arethropoasis ko utprerit karata he
 Calcitriol, the catalytic form of vitamin D, encourages intestinal absorption of calcium and renal reabsorption of phosphate
 renin, jo ki renin-angiotencin-eldosteron tantra kaa ek bhaag he, eldosteron staron ke niyantran main shaamil ek enzim hota he
 In mammals, the kidney develops from the intermediate mesoderm
 gurde kaa vikaas, jise nefrogenesis bhi kaha jaataa he, teen kramik charnon se hokar guzarataa he, jinamein se prayek ko gurde ke ek adhik unnat jode ke vikaas dwaara chihnit kiya jaataa he: pronfros, mesonefros or metanefros 
 The kidneys of various animals show evidence of developmental adaptation and have long been studied in ecology and comparative physiology
 gurde kaa akruti vigyaan, jise aksar majjatmak motaai ke rup main soochibaddh kiya jaataa he, stanpayi jeevon kii prajatiyon main prakritik awaas ke sookhepan se sambandhit hota he
 Medical glossaries associated with the kidney usually use words such as renal and nephro-prefixes
 visheshan vrikkeey, jiskaa arth hota he, vrikk se sambandhit, latin shabd reness se liya gaya he, jiskaa arth he gurde; upsarg nefro- gurde ke liye prayukt pracheen greek shabd nefros ) se liya gaya he
 For example, removal of the kidney by surgery is called nephrectomy, whereas renal dysfunction is called renal dysfunction

 Long-term kidney diseases will develop only when the amount of functional kidney tissue decreases too much

 The kidneys of fish and amphibians are typically narrow, long limbs that surround a large part of the torso
 nefron ke prayek jhund kii sangrahan nalikaayen ek archinephric nalika main jaakar rikt hoti he, jo ki amniot jeevon ke vaas defrence sadrush he
 However, this situation is not always simple; In cartilage fishes and in some amphibians, there is a small tube similar to the ureter found in amniote organisms, which empties the posterior parts of the kidney and joins the archinephric duct on the bladder or sluice
 vastutah, anek vayask upasthissom machhliyon main, gurde kaa agr bhaag vikrut ho saktaa he yaa puri tarah kaary karnaa band kar saktaa he
 In most primitive vertebrate organisms, hagfish and lampreys, the kidney structure is exceptionally simple: it consists of a line of nephrons, each of which is directly vacillated in the archinephric duct
 aksheruki jeevon main aise utsarjan ang ho sakate hai, jinka ullekh kabhi-kabhi “gurdon” ke rup main kiya jaataa he, lekin, yahaan tak ki emphioxs main bhi, ye kabhi bhi kasheruki jeevon ke gurdon ke sadrush nahin hote or zyada sahi rup se unke liye anya naamon, jaise nefredia kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The kidneys of reptiles are made up of several segments, which are roughly arranged in a linear pattern
 prayek khand ke centre main mutrvahini kii ek ekal shakha hoti he, jisamen sangrahan vahini aakar rikt hoti he
 Reptiles have relatively fewer nephrons than other amniote organisms of the same size, possibly because they have lower metabolic rates
 pakshiyon main apekshaakrit bade, lambey gurde hote hai, jinamein se prayek teen yaa adhik pruthak khandon main vibhajit hota he
 These segments are composed of several small, irregularly arranged segments, each of which is centered on a branch of the ureter

 The latter symptom is due to the presence of a large size of the loops of Henle; They are much smaller in birds and are not found in other vertebrates
 Only in mammal organisms, the kidney is in its traditional "kidney" shape, although there are some exceptions, such as the multi-tubular reniculate kidneys of members of the Timberg

 | From whose west it can be found in the sub-languages of Rajasthani
 haryana main yah dilli ke dakshini ilaakon main boli jaati he- faridabad jila or gudgaanv or mevaat jilon ke purvi bhaag
 It developed mainly in western Uttar Pradesh and adjoining Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh
 mathura, bharatpur,hindun city, dhaulpur, agra, gwalior aadi ilaakon main aaj bhi yah mukhya samvaad kii bhashaa he
 The Brajbhasha exists either in its original form or with slight changes in this one area
 isiliye is ilaake ke ek bade bhaag ko brijanchal yaa brijbhoomi bhi kaha jaataa he
 The "brajbhasha" developed in the tradition of Indian Aryan languages is born from the womb of Shaurseni Apabhramsa
 jab se gokul vallabh sampradaay kaa centre bana, brajabhasha main krishna vishyak sahitya likhaa jane laga
 With this effect, the dialect of Braj became a literary language
 bhaktikaal ke prasiddh mahakavi mahatma surdaas se lekar aadhunik kaal ke vikhyath kavi shri viyogi hari tak brajabhasha main prabandh kavy tathaa muktak kavy samay samay par rache jate rahe
 Due to the influence of district life, many forms of Braj Bhasha are visible to us
 kintu thode se antar ke saath unamem ekarupata kii spasht jhalak hamen dekhne ko milti he
 Brajbhasha has its own metaphorical nature, that is, its singular masculine nouns and adjectives are often immediate; Nouns such as Khurpou, Yamrau, Manjou, etc
 are out of date
 isi prakaar karau, goru, saanwarau aadi visheshan pad aukarant he
 The common past-present singular masculine form of the verb also remains predominantly in Brajbhasha
 yah baat alag he ki uske kuch kshetron main "y" shruti kaa aagam bhi paaya jaataa he
 In the dialect of Tehsil Kol of District Aligarh, the common past tense form is devoid of "Y" Shruti, but "Y" Shruti is definitely found in the Tehsils of District Mathura and South Bulandshahr
 jaise : "" Carau Chora Bolou "" -
 ""karau chhora bolgau"" -
 "" Carau Landa Bolou "" -
 kannauji kii apni prakruti okarant he
 In the forms of nouns, adjectives and verbs, Kannauji follows Okranta where Brajbhasha moves with inertia
 jila aligarh kii jalapadiya brajabhasha main yadi ham kahen ki- ""karau chhora bolau"" to ise hi kannauji main kahenge ki-""kaaro larika bolo
 The future verb kannauji has a tintarupini, but in the Brajbhasha, it is found to be kridantarupini
 yadi ham "ladkaa jayega" or "ladki jaaegi" vaakyon ko kannauji tathaa brajabhasha main roopantarit karke bolen to nimnaankit rup pradaan karenge : In Kannauji - Lurika Jai hai
 bitiyaa jaihai
 In Brajbhasha - Chhora Jaigou
 chhori jaigi
 It is clear from the above examples that the verb in the common future tense form of Brajbhasha changes according to the gender of the subject, while there is a form in Kannauji
 iske atirikt kannauji main avadhi kii bhanti vivruti kii pravriti bhi pai jaati he jiskaa brajabhasha main abhaav he
 Sandhyrithya is often found in the nouns, pronouns, etc
 of Kannauji, but in Brajbhasha, those terms are found in the rheumatic state
 udhaaharan : Kannauji - "" Bu Go ""
 brajabhasha -""bo gayu"" 
 In the pronouns "bo" and "bo", the pronouns of the above sentences describe the nature of the two languages of Sandhirahitya and Sandhi

 Jadobati Brajbhasha - Brajbhasha, spoken in the region of Karauli and in the plains of the Chambal River, is called "jadoubari"

 Kannauji-influenced Braj Bhasha - District Etah and Tehsils are influenced by Kannauji language of Anupshahar and Atrauli

 This article has been translated from this edition of the Wikipedia article Swine influenza
 suar influenza, ek sankramak he jo "boar influenza virus" naam ke sookshm jeev kii aneko vishisht prakaar kii prajatiyon main se kisi ek prakaar ke dharak se hoti he
 In 2009, the media called it the swine fluka, a new strain of the a / H1N1 pandemic virus, similar to the 'bird flu' that had recently occurred in a virus known as the Asian-lineage HPAI H5N1
 In many countries, it is found in many species of local wild birds
 ek boar influenza virus jo saamanytah host virus he jo suaaron main paaya jaataa he
 As of 2009, the SIV distinction consists of influenza c virus and strains influenza a virus considered as H1N1, H1N2, H3N1, H3N2, H2N3
 suar flu duniya bhar main suar aabaadi main aam he
 Swine influenza generally does not spread from pigs to humans and is often not the cause of human influenza, and often results in only antibodies in the blood
 pashu ke maance ko yadi acchhee tarah pakaaya gaya ho to usase sankraman kaa koi khatara nahin hota he
 If infection causes human influenza, it is called zoonotic swine flu
 jo log boar ke saath kaam karte hai or unke saath adhik rahete hai unako suvar flu hone kaa khatra zyada hota he
 In the mid-20th century, it was possible to identify influenza strains, which provide accurate diagnosis of transmission to humans
 tab se, pachaas sancharan kii pushti darj kii gai he
 Such a crop rarely penetrates from one person to another
 manushya main boar flu ke lakshan multah influenza ke lakshan hote hai yaa influenza jaise lakshan hote hai, jaise - jaise thand laganaa, bukhaar kaa aana, gale main karaash, mansapeshiyon main dard, gambhir sir dard, khaansee, kamajori or saamaanya asuvidha
 suar bhi maanav influenza se sankramit ho sakate hai or yah varsh 1918 ke flu mahamari ke dauraan prathit hua tha
 This 2009 swine flu in humans is caused by a new breed of influenza A, which is similar to the genes of swine influenza
 is nai nasl kaa mul agyaat he
 However, according to the report of the World Animal Health Organization, this type of flu is no different in pigs
 yah maanav se maanav ko sankramit ho saktaa hanore isamen influenza ke saamaanya lakshan dikhaai de sakate hai
 Of the three species of influenza virus that can cause human flu, two of them cause influenza in pigs, influenza virus a is common in these and influenza virus c is rare
 influenz virus b siiron main abhi suchit nahin kiya gaya he
 Influenza virus a and influenza virus c have distinct differences between humans and pigs
 vargeekaran ke kaaran genes, boar, bird or maanav prajati ke bich seemaa laangh kar jaati rahati hai
 Influenza c virus infects humans and pigs but does not infect birds
 purv main siiron or insaanon ke bich sankraman hota tha
 For example, influenza c was found among children in Japan and California
 Due to its limited carrier range and lack of genetic diversity in influenza C, this influenza does not appear as a pandemic in humans
 suar influenza, influenza a or upbhed H1N1, H1N2, H3N1, H3N2, or H2N3 ke kaaran hota he
 In pigs, three influenza a viruses appear worldwide as strains
 varsh 1998 se pehle sanyukt rajya america main, H1N1 upbhed vishesh rup se siiron ke bich main prachlit tha or 1998 ke uttarardh main agast main yah H3N2 upbhed siiron main alag paaya gaya
 varsh 2004 ke anusaar, H3N2 virus america or turki main alag-alag dikhaai dete the jo teen tarah ke vargeekaran se hote the or maanav, boar or avian vanshavali main main paae jate the
 Although there is no system in the United States to determine which viruses are transmitted to pigs, there is informally a national control system, which is a part of the world control network
 pashu chikitsak, traisi mechnamra, ne chidyaghar main ek rashtriya rog niyantran pranali kii sthapana kii he kyonki ve chideaghar main rog kii sakriy niyantran rakhte hai or vahaan kai videshi jaanavar vyapak rup main rahete hai
 Many species fall below the radar of any federal agencies, although they may be important in early detection of the causes of human disease outbreaks
 suar influenza sabase pehle ek maanav sambandhit influenza kaha gaya tha jo varsh 1918 ke flu mahamari ke dauraan pataa chalaa jab manushya kii tarah boar bhi manushya kii tarah biimaar padane lage
 sabase pehle yah influenza virus suaron kii beemaari ke rup main varsh 1930 ke baad se dikhaai dene laga
 agle 60 varshon main boar influenza H1N1 hi maatr hote the
 Then, three different strains were found between the years 1997 and 2002 that emerged as influenza among pigs of North America in three new races and five different jeans
 In 1997–1998, the H3N2 species emerged
 These genes, which were caused by the classification of humans, pigs and avian viruses, and pigs have become a major cause of influenza in North America
 H1N1 or H3N2 ke vargeekaran se H1N2 utpann hua
 In the year 1999, the H4N6 species in Canada crossed over the range of birds to the extent of pigs which were contained in the same type
 boar kaa H1N1 prakaar kaa flu varsh 1918 ke flu mahamari ke vansh kram kaa hi he
 This virus, also seen in pigs, started appearing in the year 1918 through 20th century humans, which is visible in normal seasonal influenza
 haalaanki siiron se manushyon main iskaa sidhaa prasaaran nahin hota par varsh 2005 ke baad se america main keval 12 maamle dikhaai die
 baharhaal, siiron main dikhaai dene vaala is influenza ke upbhed baad main maanav aabaadi se gaayab ho gaye jahaan ye influenza virus ho sakate the, baad main jab maanav kii rog kshamta kam ho gayi to ye phir unhen sankramit karne aa gaye
 Swine flu, a widespread distribution as well as limited distribution, has been reported several times as junosis in humans
 boar main yah prakope aam he or udyog main yah mahatvapurn aarthik nuksaan kaa kaaran hota he jo mukhya rup se ek kartab or bazaar ke vistaar ke rup main mana jaataa he
 For example, the disease costs 650 million pounds annually for the British meat industry
 varsh 1918 kii flu mahamari H1N1 or boar influenza ke rup main dikhaai di thi
 This junosis appears to occur from pigs to humans or from humans to pigs
 haalanki is baat kaa koi pramaan nahin tha ki yah virus kis disha main sthantarit hota he par praapt pramaanon ke anusaar yah rog manushya se siiron main aayaa he
 For example, swine influenza became known as a new disease in the year 1918 when influenza was detected in humans
 However, inheritance suggests that recent influenza species have been observed in humans, birds, and pigs, which in the year 1918 were found to be classified by a mammal

 farvari 5, 1976 main america kii sena main bhartee ek vyakti fort dix ne kaha ki vah thakaa hua or kamjor mahasoos kar rahaa he
 He later died and four of his fellow soldiers were later hospitalized
 Two weeks after her death, health officials reported that the cause of her death was a new breed of swine flu
 is jati ko H1N1 kaa ek prakaar mana gaya jo a / new jersey / 1976 kaha gaya
 yah 19 janvari or farvari 9 tak pataa chalaa or phir fort dix ke baad failaa nahin
 This new race looks like a caste related to the 1918 flu pandemic

 This vaccination program could not be done on time due to public relations problems and delays
 On 1 October 1976, the vaccination program began and by 11 October, approximately 400 million people, or about 24% of the population, received swine flu protection
 usee din, teen varisht naagarik boar flu kaa tikaa praapt karne ke baad mar gayi or vahaan sanchaar madhyam ne un mauton ko tikaakaran se jodne kaa prayaas kiya, yadhyapi unako iske liye koi sakaaratmak saboot nahin mili
 vigyaan lekhak patric di jasto ke anusaar, jab tak is sach kaa pataa chalata ki mauton ke tike se koi sambandh nahin he - bahut der ho chuki thi
 "the government had long feared about the swine flu - so now they began to fear about swine flu vaccination
" This was a major setback for the event
 reporton ke anusaar jin logon ne boar flu ke tike praapt kiye unamem guillein-barre syndrome paaya gaya jo ek prakaar kaa nauromuscular se sambandhit vikaar tha
 This syndrome was a rare negative effect of modern influenza vaccines, occurring in one case per one million people
 iske parinamswaroop, di jasto ne likhaa ki "janata ne sarkaar dwaara sanchalit swasthy kaaryakramon par vishwaas karnaa chhod diya jisane boode logon ko maar daalaa or yuva logon ko aapng kar diya
 " varsh 1976 ke ant tak jansankhya kaa kam se kam 33% tike praapt kar chukaa tha
 The National Influenza Vaccination Program was terminated by 16 December
 kul milakar, vahaan guillein-barre syndrome ke 500 cese darj hue jisame se 25 log fefde sambandhi jatilta se mar gaye
 According to Dr
 P
 Haber, this vaccine of 1976 arose due to a kind of clinical vaccination
 anya influenza tikon kaa sambandh jibies se nahin joda gaya
 jin logon main jibies kaa itihaas tha unako pehle hi satark kar diya gaya tha
 It was believed by a participant in the immunization program that this vaccine killed more Americans than the disease

 Additional studies showed that patients who were in contact with health workers developed mild influenza, similar to the infection of pigs with diseases of the swine
 haalanki, isamen koi samudaay prakope nahin hua
 In 1998, swine flu was found in four US states
 ek varsh ke bheetar-bheetar yah sanyukt rajya bhar main suar aabaadiyon ke bich fail gaya
 vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki yah virus siiron se utpann hua he jo pakshiyon or manushyon se flu upabhedon ke rup main dikhaai detaa he
 This showed that pigs emerge as a crucible where new influenza viruses appear in different species as a result of the classification of genes from different strains
 20 agast 2007 krishi vibhaag ke adhikariyon ne is prakope kii jaanch philipppin ke nueva asija or central lujon, main kii
 swine flu ke kaaran hui mratyu dar 10% se bhi kam he, jab tak ki vahaan hogg haija jaisi jatilta nahin hai
 On July 27, 2007, the Philippine National Meat Inspection Service announced a "red alert" towards pig cholera, where the disease spread to five provinces of Luzon from the backward pig farms of Metro Manila as well as Bulacan and Pampanga
 Swine was proven negative for the flu
 yah 2009 flu ke failane kaa kaaran upbhed H1N1 kii ek nai nasl maani gayi jo pehle siiron main report nahin hui thi
 In late April, Margaret Chan, the director general of the World Health Organization, announced "a public health emergency of international concern", according to who's new international health regulations when information to the United States about the first case of the H1N1 virus Under this, on 2 May 2009, when it was reported to spread in Mexico, it was found that its link Alber Received, appeared at a farm in Canada
 These pigs, seem to have obtained this new breed from a laborer who had recently returned from Mexico and had signs of influenza
 ye sambhavit maamle hai, jinaki pushti prayogshaala main lambit he
 It is characterized by a new virus influenza a type of virus classification consisting of strains of H1N1 from four species, one from humans, one from birds and two from pigs
 }aagaamee vishleshan se yah pataa chalaa ki yah do prakaar kii jatiyon se yukt he jo siiron main pai jaati he
 Although early reports called the new species a swine influenza, its origin is still unknown
 kai deshon main is beemaari ko ek vaishvik mahamari kii sambhaavna maan kar is ke liye kai ehtiyaati upaay liye hai
 Swine flu has been compared to many other swine flu influenza viruses, keeping mortality in mind
 "america main aise lagata he ki har 1000 logon main se jo sankramit hote he unamem se 40 logon ko aspataal main pravesh lenaa padataa he or ek vyakti kii maut ho jaati he
 There is also a fear that swine flu will become a major global epidemic in the winter months and hence many countries are planning vaccination campaigns
 influenzan siiron main aam he kyonki sanyukt raashtra main boar paalan ke aadhe se bhi zyada prajnansheel siiron kaa sampark virus se ho chukaa he
 Antibodies to this virus are also common in other countries
 sancharan kaa mukhya kaaran sankramit or asankramit jaanwaron ke bich sidhe sampark ke madhyam se hota he
 These contacts are common, especially during animal transport
 gahan kheti bhi sancharan ke khatre ko badha saktaa he kyonki yahan boar ek duusare ke bahut kareeb hote hai
 Direct transfer of the virus is probably either from the pigs' nostrils or via dried mucus
 hawa dwaara sankraman bhi tab hota he jab ye boar yaa to khansate he yaa cheenkte hai
 The virus usually spreads very quickly in a few days through a swarm
 sankraman duusare junglee jaanwaron se bhi ho saktaa he
 Infection spreads from all pigs within a few days
 yah sankraman junglee boar, yaa junglee jaanwaron se bhi ho sakate hai jo is rog ko farm se failaate hai
 Those who work with poultry and pigs are at greater risk of these
 aise logon ko junotic sankraman kaa khatra rahata hai jo virus pashuon main paaya jaataa he
 Due to this a population can be formed in which humans can be its carriers and in them junosis and classification may be possible
 in karmchaariyon ko influenza ke prati tikaakaran or nae influenza jati ke khilaaf nigaraanee saarvajanik swasthya ke prati ek acha upaay ho saktaa he
 At the University of Iowa in 2004, people who work with swine documented a small surveillance study on the transfer of influenza from swine to humans
 yah adhyayan anya logon ke bich aadhaar bana he ki jinaki naukariyaan boar par aadhaarit hai, unke liye swine ek saarvajanik swasthya nigaraanee kaa centre he
 Other occupations in which the infection is more common are veterinarians and meat processing workers, although the risk of infection for these two groups is lower than farm workers
 boar asaamaanya hote hai kyonki ve influenza upabhedon ke teen alag-alag prajatiyon se sankramit ho sakate hai : siiron, pakshiyon or manushyon
isse boar influenza virus ke vaahak ban jate hai jahaan jin vinimay ke saath-saath nae or khatarnaak jatiyon kaa utpaadan karte hai
 The avian influenza virus H3N2 is endemic in pigs in China and has also been identified in pigs in Vietnam, leading to the emergence of new strains
 H3N2 H2N2 se pratijnike dwaara viksit hue he
 In August 2004, researchers found H5N1 in pigs in China
 ye H5N1 sankraman kaaphi aam ho saktaa he: pashchim java ke paultry farm main jab bird flu chal pada to 10 swasth siiron ke surveykshan se pataa chalaa ki paanch suaron ke namoonay main H5N1 virus nihit he
 The Indonesian government received similar results in this area
 Additional tests conducted on 150 pigs outside this area were negative
 siiron main influenza sankraman se, bukhaar aata he, susti hoti he, chhinke aati hai, khaansi hoti he, shwaas lene main kathinaayee or bhukh kii kami mahasoos hoti he
 In some cases, infection also leads to miscarriage
 haalanki mrityu dar aam taur par kam he, virus vajan ghataane ke saath-saath or vikaas ko bhi kam karte hai jisase kisaanon ko aarthik nuksaan pahunchataa hai
 The body weight of infected pigs decreases by more than 12 pounds over a period of 3 to 4 weeks
 siiron se manushya main boar flu virus kaa sidhaa sankraman kabhi-kabhi hi sambhav ho saktaa he 
 chikitsa sahitya ke report anusaar varsh 1958 main darj pehle cese se aaj tak 50 cese praapt ho chuke hai jin main se chah maut ho gayi hai
 One in six people was pregnant, one had blood cancer, one was a Hodgkin patient and two are said to be healthy
 yadhyapi ye sankraman kii kam sankhya he, sankraman ke sahi dar kaa pataa nahin he, kyonki zyaadaatar maamalon main keval bahut hi halkaa rog ho saktaa he, jo na to report kiye jaayegein yaa inkaa kabhi nidaan hi ho paayegaa
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, swine flu in humans sounds similar to the 2009 H1N1 virus influenza and influenza-like illness
 in lakshanon main bukhaar, khaansi, gale main dard, sharir main dard, sirdard, thand or thakaan shaamil hai
 In the 2009 outbreak, most patients have seen diarrhea and vomiting
 varsh 2009 kaa H1N1 virus junotic boar flu nahin he, kyonki yah boar se manushya main preshit nahin hota he, vyakti se vyakti ko hota he
 Because these symptoms are not specific to swine flu
 sambhavit boar flu kaa ek vibhedak nidaan hai ki boar flu main vyakti main ve lakshan dikhne chahie jo us vyakti ke haal ke itihaas kii vajah se he
 For example, during the swine flu outbreak in the United States in 2009, the CDC told physicians that "people with swine flu who have confirmed fever as well as severe respiratory disease are those who have swine flu
" Have received contacts, which were in the five states of the United Nations where people have suffered from swine flu, who lived in Mexico 7 days before becoming ill
 Asked were, to consider "
 Laboratory tests required to confirm swine flu boar influenza ke nivaaran ke teen ghatak hai : boar main rokthaam, manushya main sancharan kaa rokthaam or manushyon ke bich iske failane se rokna
 There are ways to prevent the spread of influenza among pigs - facility management, herd management and vaccination
 Because most disease and death is caused by other pathogens associated with swine flu, vaccine-dependent controls may be inadequate
 haal ke dashak main tikaakaran dwaara boar influenza par niyantran karnaa mushkil ho gaya he, virus ke udbhav se paramparaagat tikaakaran asangat ho gaya he
 Standard commercial swine flu vaccines are effective in controlling infections when virus strains are sufficient for significant protection and drugs made by specific viruses are used in complex cases
 SIV niyantran or rokthaam ke liye banaaye gaye tike swine fermon main SIV tikaakaran ke liye prayog kiye jate he jo vanijyik rup main sanyukt rajya america main uplabdh hai
 In a recent investigation of 97 H3N2 isolates, it was found that 41 of them are virus-resistant and have three antagonistic reactions
 influenza tikon kii rakshaatmak kshamta mukhyatah tike ke virus or mahamari virus ke bich nikat sambandh par nirbhar karata he, SIV main sthit apribhavi H3N2 prakaar yah bataate hai ki vartmaan vyavsaayik tike prabhavit rup se H3N2 sankraman virus se siiron kii raksha nahin kar sakate he
 Researchers at the United States Department of Agriculture say that the infection does not stop as long as pigs are sick with pig vaccinations
 suvidha prabandhan main vyapak vaataavaran ke saath-saath vaataavaran main vidyaman virus ko niyantrit karnaa or keitanurahit vaataavaran bananaa bhi shaamil he
 The virus cannot live outside of living cells for more than two weeks, but in the cold, sterile environment it becomes lethargic
 jhund prabandh kaa matlab influenza ko lekar chalane vaale siiron ko jhund main shaamil karnaa nahin hai jo is virus ke sampark main aa chuke hai
 The virus lives in healthy pigs for up to 3 months and can be recovered at the time of outbreak
 vaahak boar aamtaur par SIV ko asankramit jhund main yaa desh main shuru karne ke liye jimmedaar hote hai taaki nae pashu unase alag rakhen jaaen
 iske failane ke baad, sankramit siiron main rog nirmulan shakti kam ho jaati he, to iskaa prakope bad jaataa he
 Pig influenza can occur from both strains of human influenza and avian influenza, becoming carriers of these antigens that can breed a new influenza species
 boar se maanav main sthaanantaran mukhyatah formon main hota he jahaan kisaan siiron ke saath nikat sampark main rahete hai
 Although swine influenza species are generally not capable of infecting humans, this is sometimes possible, so farmers and veterinarians must deal with infected animals by putting a mask on their faces
 Use of vaccines on pigs, to prevent infection, is a major method of preventing transmission in humans
 jokhim kaarak jo boar se manushya main rog ko sankraman karne main yogadan dete hai ve hai dhumrapaan or pashuon ke saath kaam karte samay dastaanon kaa na pahananaa he
 Infection is spread among humans by coughing or sneezing and by people touching objects containing the virus and then touching their nose or mouth
 suar flu pork utpaadon se nahin fail saktaa he, kyonki vishaanu bhojan ke madhyam se preshit nahin hote hai
 In humans, swine flu is more infected during the first five days, although some people, most children, can live for ten days
 nidaan ke liye, namoonay ko vishleshan ke liye pehle paanch dinon main ekatra kar bhej sakate hai
 One can also use standard infection control against influenza to prevent the spread of this virus among humans
 saarvajanik sthanon main jane par sabun or pani, haath dhone ke liye madh mishrit dawa kaa prayog karnaa chahie
sancharan ko rokane ke liye ghar main sabhi vastuon ko keitanurahit karnaa hoga, jo ek patale chlorine bleech ke dwaara sambhav ho saktaa he
 However, this trivalent influenza vaccine is not able to provide protection against the new 2009 H1N1 species
 nayi nasl ke khilaaf tike viksit kiye ja rahe hai or june 2009 tak ye taiyaar ho jaayegein
 Experts are of the opinion that hand washing prevents viral infections, including simple influenza and swine flu virus
 influenza khansane yaa chhikane se failati he, lekin praapt sakshya ke anusaar choti buundon ke rup main wires mej par, telephone or anya satahon par rahete hai or ungliyon ke madhyam se munh, naak yaa aankhon main sthantarit ho jate hai
 Viruses and bacteria are destroyed by scrubbing with foam or gel containing alcohol
 kisi bhi vyakti main yadi flu ke jaise koi lakshan hai jaise - achaanak bukhaar, khaansi yaa mansapeshiyon kaa dard, to unhen kaam se dur rahanaa chahie yaa saarvajanik parivahan se dur rahanaa chahie or doctor se sampark karnaa chahie
 Avoiding socially is also another way
 iskaa matlab he ki un logon se dur rahanaa jo sankramit ho sakate hai, bade sammelnon main jane se parhez karnaa, thoda kaam karnaa, ghar par rahakar bistar par pade rahanaa yadi sankraman kisi samudaay main fail rahaa he
 Public health and other responsible officials may request them to stay away or even ask them to stay away from society if the spread of the disease is seen to be serious
 jaisaa ki kaha jaataa he boar influenza siiron ke liye ghaatak nahin he, iske liye thode se upachaar or dekhbhaal kii jarurat he
 Instead, veterinary efforts focus on farms and other farms
 tikaakaran or pashu prabandhan takanic in prayaason ke liye sabase zyada mahatvapurn hai
 Antibiotics are also used for its treatment, which do not affect the influenza virus, helping to prevent bacterial pneumonia and other secondary infections on influenza-weaned herds
 yadi koi vyakti boar flu se biimaar ho jaataa he, to virus virdohi dawaaon se beemaari kam ho jaati he or marij teji se behatar mahasoos karata he
 They can also prevent serious flu complications
 ilaaj ke liye, virus virdohi dawaaen behtareen kaam karti hai yadi rog shuru hone ke tunrat shuru kar diya jaae 
 ghar yaa aspataal main virus virdohi dawaaon ke alaava, prashamak dekhbhaal, fever ko niyantrit karte hue or taral padaarthon kaa santulan karte hue upachaar kar sakate hai
 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of Tamiflu or Ralenza, which proves useful for infection or prevention of swine flu virus
 lekin zyaadaatar log jo is vishaanu se sankramit hai bina chikitsa yaa virus virdohi dawaaon ke prayog ke thik ho jate hai
 The virus that spread in 2009 is resistant to amantadine and rimantadine
 america main, 27 april 2009 ko khaadya evam aushadhi prashasan ne apatkaaleen istemaal ke liye praadhikaran jari kiya ki railenza or tamiflu virus virdohi dawa uplabdh karwaae jo swine flu ke upachaar ke liye jaruri he or jo abhi ananumodith nahin hai

, refer to the operation of 3 arteries that carry blood to the heart
 hriday kii dhamni main kuch rukaawat hone ko hriday dhamni rog kehete hai
 This blockage occurs due to the accumulation of fat, which makes the artery hard and prevents the smooth flow of blood
 hriday ke valve kharaab hone, raktchaap badhane, hriday kii mansapeshi badhane or hriday kamjor hone se hridayaghat ho jaataa he
 If timely treatment can be avoided
 dhamni ke purna band hone kii sthiti main hridayaghat kii ashanka bad jaati hai
 Any or all of the three main arteries of the heart can cause obstruction
 aise main shalya kriya dwaara sharir ke kisi bhaag se nas nikaalkar use hriday kii dhamni ke ruke hue sthaan ke samanaantar jod diya jaataa he
 This newly added vein resumes blood flow to the artery
 is shalya-kriya takanic ko bypass surgery kehete hai
 Often memory artery from inside the chest or radial artery by hand or saphenous vein from the foot is connected to the heart artery
 is kriya main puraani rukii hui dhamni ko hataate nahin he, balki usee dhamni main blaak yaa rukaawat ke aage nai nas jod di jaati he, isi se rakt pravaah pun: sucharu hota he
 Bypass surgery is the best option in case of arterial obstruction
 iskaa doosraa or apekshaakrit sasta vikalp he angeoplasty
 Angioplasty often results in a blockage in one of the arteries of the heart
 lekin jab ek yaa adhik coronary dhamniyon main bahut adhik jamaav hone par yaa unki upashakhaayen bahut adhik sikud jaae jaae to bypass surgery yani coronary artery bypass graphting hi ekmaatr vikalp hota he
 Bypass surgery is necessary in the following situations - bypass surgery ke aaparishan ke liye pehle seene ke bich kii haddi ko katkar hriday ko gamy banane hetu khol diya jaataa he
 After that, it is connected to the heart-lung machine, which makes this machine work for the heart and lungs
 hriday ko ek aise ghol se dho dete hai, jisase uskaa taapmaana kam ho jaataa he or uskaa dhadkna bhi band ho jaataa he

 The wires of the cardiac monitor are attached to the patient's chest by electrodes and the ECG and heart rate are continuously marked
 ek dhamni main ek kenula lagi rahati he jise rogi kaa raktchaap jaancha jaataa rahata he or doosraa kenula gardara kii nas main laga hota he or yah nas ke bheetar kaa daab bataata he
 There are also two tubes in the chest of the patient, from which the fluid that collects inside the chest keeps coming out
 ye sari naliyaan aaparishan ke ek din baad nikaal di jaati hai
 Apart from these, an endotracheal tube remains in the patient's respiratory tube for 16 to 24 hours after the operation
 yah nalee kritrim shwaas-yantra se judi hoti he or rogi ko shwasan main madad karata he
 It is removed when the patient starts breathing well
 jab tak yah nalee shwaas nalee main hoti he rogi na to kuch kha pi saktaa he or na hi baat kar paata he
 An oxygen mask is also placed on the mouth and nose of the patient, so that the patient gets adequate amount of oxygen
 praayah aaparishan ke 1-2 saptaah main rogi ko aspataal se nivritti mil jaati he

 Devil May Cry is a series of 5 hack and slash video games made according to modern times
 is shrinkhalaa ko capkom dwaara viksit or hideki kaamiya dwaara nirmit kiya gaya tha
 It was originally created as a sequel to Capcom's Resident Evil series, but Devil May Cry's style was so different from the series' style that it was developed in a completely new way
 devil me krai ko video games kii 3di hack and slash style kii utpatti ke rup main mana jaataa he; video games kii ninja gaaiden, shinobi, god of waar siries kaa number iske baad aata he
 The series revolves around its hero Dante taking revenge for the murder of his mother by annihilating the demons

 Following the end of Resident Evil 2 in 1998, preparatory work began on the Resident Evil series for playstation 2 under the direction of Hideki Kamiya under the name "team Little Devil"
 praarambhik shodh or vikaas kaary ke tahat is khel kii prishthbhumi ke aadhaar ke rup main spain ke kai kilon kaa daura kiya gaya
 However, in its initial condition it was proved that it is quite different from the established formula of Resident Evil and the whole survival horror style

 The game mainly focuses on high speed and high-style combat; Achieving high style rankings requires long strikes and self-defense methods while keeping your damage to a minimum
 baad main games main system ko thodaa sanshodhit kar diya gaya taaki khilaadi ko apni style rank banaaye rakhane ke liye apane dwaara prayog kiye jane vaale hamalon ko lagaataar badalte rahanaa pade
 style rank kii shrenee ko khel ke dauraan aksharon dwaara darshaya jaataa he; kramshah sabase kharaab se sabase achche ke liye: di, si, bi, e, es

 Dante is usually the protagonist of the games, although Trish was also available to play in the second game; Devil May Cry 2 had another character who could be chosen instead; In the special edition of Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening, the player was allowed to use Vergil and a new hero named Nero is introduced in Devil May Cry 4
 siries ke prayek khel main nae tatwon ko joda gaya he
 Devil May Cry introduced the 'style 1' meter and ranking under which players are encouraged to attack continuously while avoiding damage
 devil me krai 2 main hawa main udate hue mishrit hamalaa karne kii kshamta tathaa bachaav ke ek batan ko pesh kiya gaya
 In this, a weapon change button was also introduced so that the player can choose his weapon from many weapons without going to the inventory screen

 hathiyaar badalane ke ek duusare batan ko bhi joda gaya tha jisaki sahaayta se khilaadi 'devil arms' naamak hathapayee ke hathiyaaron ko chun saktaa he
 Devil May Cry 4 has undergone a major refurbishment of its protagonist Nero as the "devil Bringer" arm, giving players the ability to attack or slam into the ground by bringing nearby enemies away
 nero ke paas ek talwaar bhi he jise ek throtal handle kii madad se ghumaya ja saktaa he; yah khilaadiyon ko apane agle hamale main adhik kshati pahunchane ke liye talwaar ko pricharge karne main sakasham banaati he, yaa or adhik kshati tathaa style praapt karne ke liye ise prayek hamale ke baad sateek timming dwaara charge bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Like Dante, players can easily change their style in the middle of a fight

 Arkham intends to steal Sparda's sword, Force Edge
 dante shaitanon kii duniya main pahunchakar arkhaam kaa saamana karata he or vergill ke saath milakar use haraa detaa he
 Dante and Vergil fight and eventually Dante wins

 He foils her attack and she claims that Mundus, the Emperor of the Devils, is planning to return
 dante malett dweep par khojbin karata he jahaan uskaa saamana kai prakaar ke shaitanon se hota he, jiname se ek he nilo angelo
 dante haar jaataa he lekin nilo angelo bhaag jaataa he
 Mundus' fight with other generals shows that Dante becomes more powerful than his father after waking up in Devil May Cry 3
 nilo angelo baad ke anya abhiyaanon main bhi do baar hamalaa karata he or ant main pataa chalata he ki vah dante kaa judwa bhai vergill hi he
 Dante enters the underworld in search of Mundus where Trish makes her sacrifice to save her
 dante devil me krai 3 main vergill dwaara praapt karne kii ichha rakhane vaale sparda kii shakti ko jaagrit kar detaa he
 After that Dante and Mundus fight on a new dimension of existence

 There are several factors that determine capital and operating costs for desalination: capacity and type of unit, location, raw water, labor, energy, financing and disposal of condensed water
 Desalination plants can now control optimization of saline concentrations for pressure, temperature, and water drainage
 bade paimaane par parmaanu shakti se chalane vaale diselination adhik kifayati ho sakate hai
 While it is worth noting that the cost is decreasing and the technology is generally positive for generally affluent areas that are adjacent to the oceans, one study argues that "desalination for some areas with low water There may be a solution, but it is not a solution for the poor, located in the interior parts of the continent, or at higher elevations
