 Caste is the most basic and lower class in the biological classification of organisms
 jeevvaigyanik nazariye se aise jeevon ke samooh ko ek jati bulaayaa jaataa he jo ek dusre ke saath santan utpann karne kii kshamta rakhte ho or jinaki santan swayan aage santan janane kii kshamta rakhti ho
 For example, a wolf and a lion cannot bear children among themselves, so they are considered to be of different castes
 ek ghoda or gadhaa aapas main baccha paidaa kar sakate hai, lekin kyonki khachchar aage baccha janane main asamarth hote hai, isliye ghode or gadhe bhi alag jatiyon ke maane jate hai
 In contrast, dogs are found in very different sizes, but any male dog and female dog can have children that are capable of producing offspring themselves
 isliye sabhi kute, chaahe ve kisi nasal ke hi kyon na hon, jeevvaigyanik drushti se ek hi jati ke sadsy samajhe jate hai
 Different castes having similarities with each other, in which the biologists believe that they originated from the same ancestor in the past and have been divided into different branches over time through evolution, are put into the same biological lineage is
 masalan ghode, gadhe or zebra alag jatiyon ke hai lekin teenon ek hi 'ekwas' vansh ke sadsy maane jate hai
 The definition of castes in modern times is also done by examining other aspects
 udhaaharan ke liye anuvanshiki kaa prayog karke aksar jeevon kaa di en e parkhaa jaataa he or is aadhaar par un jeevon ko ek jati ghoshit kiya jaataa he jinaki di en e chhap ek duusare se milti ho or duusare jeevon se alag ho
 The definition used for the term "caste" and reliable methods of identifying caste are essential for biological tests and assessment of biodiversity
 prastaavit jatiyon ke kai udaahranon kaa adhyayan aksharon ko jod kar kiya janaa chahie isse pehle kii yah ek jati maan lee jaae
 yah aam taur par un vilupt jatiyon ke liye sankshipt vargeekrut shrenee he jisaki jaankaree keval jeevashm se hi praapt karnaa mumkin he
 Some zoologists may view statistical phenomena as opposed to the traditional idea of the class of species observed in animals
 aisi sthiti main kisi jati ko pruthak rup se shaamil vansh ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jo ekal jin pool kisanrachana karata he
 However, definitions such as dna-sequence and morphology, used to help isolate lineages that are highly related to each other, have clear limitations
 haalanki, "jati" shabd kii sateek paribhaasha abhi bhi vivaadaaspad he, visheshkar jeevakosh ke sambandh main, or yah jati samasya kehalaati he
 Biologists have given more detailed definitions, but there are only a few options used that depend on the characteristics of the respective castes
 aamtaur par istemaal kiye jane vaale paudhe or pashuon ke naam ko taxa kabhi-kabhi in jatiyon ke samaan hote hai: jaise, "sher", "walras," or "kapur kaa ped" - prayek jatiyon ko darshaate hai
 Other cases in which those names are not used: "deer" refers to a class of 34 castes, including eld deer, red deer, and reindeer
 baad vaali do jatiyon ko kabhi yah vyakhya karte hue ek hi jati mana jaataa tha ki vaigyanik gyaan badhane ke saath-saath jatiyon kii simaaen kitni parivartit ho sakati hai
 Due to the difficulties in defining both the world and calculating their total number, it is estimated that anywhere between two and 100 million / 2 to 100 million of this type can be different species
 adarsh rup main, kisi jati ko ek aupchaarik rup se vaigyanik naam diya jaataa he, haalanki vyavhaar main aisi bahut si jatiyaan hai 
 kisi jati kaa naam tab rakhaa jaataa he, jab ise vansh-varg / vansh-kram main rakhaa jaataa he
 From the scientific point of view, it can be considered a hypothesis that castes are much more related to the genus of other castes than to other lineages
 ek saamaanya jatiyon main shaamil he or / iske rup main sabase acha gyaat vargeekaran shrenee hai: jivan, kshetra, rajya, jati, varg, kram, parivaar, vansh or jati
 jinas ko iskaa nirdhaaran karnaa aparivarty nahin; koi vargeekaran vaigyanik baad main main ise bhinn jinas de saktaa he jis kaaran uskaa naam bhi badal jayega
 In biological nomenclature, a caste name has two parts, they are considered Latin, although the name and place of any native language or the name of a person can be used for it
 jati naam pehle ke baad doosraa shabd, vishesh naam soochibaddh he
 For example, the species known as the long-leaf pine is the genus Pinus palustris, whose brown wolves belong to the Canis lumpus, the Coytes canis latrans, the golden fox canis orus, and they all belong to the genus Canis
 Not only in other words, but caste names are completely bipedal

 At that time the main biological principle was that the freely represented species were originated by God and hence they are considered to be real and immutable, so that the hypothesis of common ancestry is not applicable
 pustakon or lekh main / inke sankshipt naam / rakhe jate hai or iske sankshipt naam ek vachan main "sp

 " ko vishesh naam par rakhaa jaataa he: udhaaharan ke liye, kenis sp
 aisa aamtaur par nimnlikhit sthitiyon main hota he: In books and articles, the names of genus and castes are usually printed in italics
 "sp
" or "spp
" kaa upyog karke inhen itelic nahin karnaa chahie
 It is astonishingly difficult to explain the term "caste" which applies to all natural beings and to biologists about how to interpret castes and how to identify real castes is called the caste problem
 adhikansh pathyapustakon main kisi jati "vaastavik or sambhavit antar nasl prakritik aabaadi vaale samooh" jo aise anya samooh prajnan ke taur par alag rakhe jate hai
 Various parts of this definition, such as some unusual or artificial intercourse, are excluded from it: uparokt adarsh pathyapustak vaali paribhaasha bahu-koshikeey praaniyon ke liye acchhee tarah kaary karti he lekin aisi bhi kuch paristhitiyaan hai jahaan par inhen anupyukt tehraaya ja saktaa he: Horizontal gene transfer makes the term "race" even more complicated to define
 prokerat samooh ke asmaan samoohon or or kam se kam aksar eukerets ke asmaan samoohon ke bich kshaitijiy jin sthanantaran ke majboot sakshya hai or williamson kaa tark he ki crustaciuns or ekinoderm main iske kuch sakshya uplabdh hai
 All definitions of the term "race" that all of their genes are derived from one or two parents are exactly the same as that animal, but basic gene transfer seems to be misconceived
 ek sabase badhiya prashn yah he "jati" shabd jisaki vyakhya jeev vigyaani dete aae hai or is charchaa ko jatiyon kii samasya ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Darwin wrote in Chapter II of On the Origin of Species
 lekin baad main, darwin ne apni The Descent of Man main yah kehete hue apane mat main sanshodhan kiya ki "kya maanav main ek yaa anek jatiyaan shaamil hai"
 The modern theory of development rests on new fundamental definitions of "caste"
 darwin se pehle, prakrutivaadiyon ne jatiyon ko adarsh yaa saamaanya prakaar ke rup main dekha, jiskaa udhaaharan kisi adarsh namoonay ke saath diya ja saktaa he jisamen saamaanya jati ke samaan ve sabhi gun uplabdh hai
 The uniformity of Darwin's theory shifted attention from the simple to the special
 bauddhik itihaaskaar louis minand ke anusaar, It transforms "caste" into a new approach; Darwin vyaavhaarik rup se, jeev vigyaniyon ne jatiyon ko paribhaashit praaniyon kii aabaadi jinamein anuvanshik samanta kaa str ucch hota he ke rup main kii he
 It can reflect the adaptation of the same organism and transfer varieties of genetic material from one potential to another
 is prakaar kii paribhaasha main samanta ke sateek str kaa uprayog ekapaksheeya hota he, lekin yah praaniyon ke liye upyog kii jane vaali sabase aam paribhaasha he jisase alangik prajnan hota he, jiseki kuch paudhe or sookshm praani
 The lack of any apparent caste deficiency in microbiology has led some authors to argue that the use of the term "caste" is not correct when studying bacteria
 iske bajaay unhone jin ko dur-daraaj se sambandhit bacteria ko sambandhit bacteria ko sampurna bacteria sambandhi kshetra ko ek jin vaale pool ke saath swatantra rup se vichrate hue dekhte hai
 Nevertheless, the rule of thumb was established stating that more than 97% of the same 16S rrna gene sequence bacteria or Archaea should be examined by DNA ‚Äì DNA hybridization regardless of whether they belong to the same species
 is avadharana kaa adhyatan haal hi main yah kehete hue kiya gaya he ki 97% kii seemaa bhi bahut kam thi or use 98
7% tak badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Sexually borne organisms, where the genetic material is shared in the reproductive process, then the interbreeding process of the two animals and the hybrid offspring of both sexes are accepted as equal indicators that the animals have shared the same species
 Has adopted abundant genes as a member of
 ek prakaar se "jati" antar prajnan praaniyon kaa ek samooh he
 This definition can be extended further by stating that a caste is a group of animals capable of potentially interbreeding breeding - fish can be kept in the same species even if they live in different lakes because they Interracial breeding can occur if they have ever come in contact with each other
 On the other hand, there are many examples of three or more bizarre populations of whether animals with intercultural populations can breed interculturally in other types of populations, but on the other hand, these populations are not capable of interbreeding
 is prakaar se, yah vishay bahes yogya he ki ye aabaadiyaan ek yaa do alag-alag jatiyaan banaati hai
 There is no contradiction in that species are defined based on gene frequencies and thus have ambiguous boundaries
 natijatan, "jati" kii saarvbhaumik paribhaasha aavashyak rup se ekapaksheeya he
 Instead, biologists have given many definitions; The use of which is the perfect choice for any zoologist depends on the characteristics of that zoologist's research
 abhyaas main, ye paribhaashaayen samaan hai or unke bich ekamusth virodhabhas kii tulana main unka maamla adhik mahatvapurn he
 Nevertheless, none of the concepts of caste proposed so far are fully objective or can apply in all cases without assistance for a decision
 jivan kii jatilta ko dekhte hue, kuch kaa kahana he ki is tarah ke ek uddeshy kii paribhaasha sabhi prakaar kii sambhaavnaaon main asambhav he or jeev vaigyanikon ko sabase adhik vyaavhaarik paribhaasha kaa nirdhaaran karnaa chahie
 It is the concept of all biological species in most spineless animals and is largely deficient in the phylogenetic race
 kai BSC up-jatiyon ko PSC ke antargat jati mana jaataa he; BSC or PSC ke bich antar kaa nirdhaaran kiya ja saktaa he kyonki BSC jati ko spasht vikasvaadi itihaas ke parinamswaroop jati ko paribhaashit karata he, jabaki PSC kisi jati ko spasht vikasvaadi sambhaavna ke parinamswaroop paribhaashit karata he
 In this way, the PSC castes were "created" as soon as the evolutionary lineage began to be separated, while the BSC caste began to emerge only when their lineage separation was complete
 tadnusaar, PSC banaam BSC ke aadhaar par vaikalpik vargeekaran ke bich paryaapt vivaad sambhav he kyonki unke taxa ke vyavhaar ke aadhaar par ve bilkul bhinn hai, use baad vaale model ke antargat up-jatiyaan maanya hongi
 Life-supporting castes: Many castes are absolutely bizarre towards adaptation to the environment, as they are capable of yielding or breeding under certain conditions such as drought, desertification, flooding, soil poisoning, soil salinity, many of which are food
 , Providing materials and empowering humans, livestock and other animals are considered potentially beneficial to humans A
 These are known as life-supporting nations
 jiseki unamem parsparik mukhya jatiyaan shaamil hai kyonki inke paas bhu-akritiyon kii akhandta kii mukhya kunjee hoti he jisamen donon praaniyon ke biodeta or maanav samudaay shaamil hai
 Both ecological and socioeconomic castes are tributaries for life
 jatiyon ke vargeekaran ke saath purvollekhith samasyaon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue nimnlikhit sankhya keval naam maatr kaa maargdarshan he
 In 2007, they were as follows: jatiyon kii kul sankhya : 7-100 million sahit: Among the Eukaryte castes, we could only identify them: vartmaan main, global texonomi inishiative, european distributed institute of texonomi or censos of marine life texonomi sudhaar kaa prayaas kar rahe hai or pehle se agyaat jatiyon ko texonomi system ko amal main laa rahe hai
 Due to the fact that we know only a few creatures in the living room, yet we do not have full understanding of the functioning of our environment
 professor james melette ke anusaar ham nai jatiyon kii khoj ke baavjood maamalon ko bad se badtar banaate ja rahe hai or ham in jatiyon ko abhootpurv gati ke saath samaapt karte ja rahe hai
 It also means that it must be studied and classified before acquiring a new race, since it may have already become extinct
 jatiyon kii dharna kaa lanbaa itihaas he
 This is one of the most important levels of classification for several reasons: varshon ke prayog ke baad, jeev vigyaan kii avadharana or sambandhit kshetra ke mejabaan ke rup main pramukh rahi he lekin abhi tak ise purna rup se paribhaashit nahin kii gai he
 The nomenclature of a particular caste should be considered hypotheses about the evolutionary relationship and diversity of the organisms of that group
 agrim jaankaree haath main aate hi pariklpana kii pushti yaa uskaa khandan kiya ja saktaa he
 Sometimes, especially when communication was much more difficult in the past, classification scientists working on segregation gave different names to different animals that were later identified as a common race
 jab do naam vaali jati kii khoj ek jati ke rup main kii gai, to puraani jati kaa naam aamtaur se kaayam rakhaa gaya or nai jati ke naam ko vah naam de diya gaya, ek aisi prakriya jo ekatrikaran ke rup main paryaayavacheekaran yaa bolchaal kii prakriya kehalaati he
 The division of a texon into more than one is usually called a texon
 vargeekaran vaigyanikon ko aamtaur se unke sahpaathiyon dwaara unhen "lanpar" yaa "splitre" kaha jaataa he, jo jantuon ke bich pahachaane jane vaale antar par unke vyaktigat drushtikon or samaantaaon par nirbhar karata he
 Traditionally, researchers have relied on the observation of structural differences and the observation of whether or not their differential reproduction was successfully carried out for differences in castes in different populations; Both anatomy and reproductive behavior are still important to state the status of castes
 pichley kuch dashakon main, sookshmjeevigyaani anusandhan takanic main kranti ke parinamswaroop jaise DNA vishleshan se jatiyon ke bich antar or samaantaaon ke bare main athaah gyaan uplabdh ho gaya he
 Many populations formerly considered as separate castes are now considered a taxon and the pre-grouped population is divided
 koi vargeekaran str kaa paryaayavacheekaran yaa vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he or ucch texonomik str par ye sanshodhan abhi bhi bahut athaah hai
 From the classification point of view, groups in race can be defined more as Texon classification than race
 praanivigyaan main keval up-jatiyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jabaki vanaspati vigyaan main vividhta, up-vividhta or swaroop kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 In conservation biology, the evolutionary critical unit is used that can be defined as a segment with a caste or more small bizarre population
 vigyaan ke praarambhik kaary main, jati keval alag-alag praani hote the jo apane samaan yaa lagbhag samaan praaniyon ke samooh kaa pratinidhitiv karte the
 At that time no other relations were applicable to them
 arestu ne jinas or jati shabd kaa upyog jatigat yaa vishesh virgon ke liye kiya
 Aristotle and other pre-darwinian scientists considered castes to be special and immutable as chemical elements such as "essence"
 When the early observers began to develop the organization as a system for organisms, they began to place the segregated space beforehand
 inamen se kai praarambhik chithran yojanaon ko ab sanakee nahin mana jayega or inamen samarktata ke aadhaar par rang yaa vyavhaar shaamil hai
 In the 18th century, Swedish scientist Carolus Linnaeus classified organisms according to reproductive organs
 haalanki jeevon ke vargeekaran ke unke prakaar ne samanta ke anusaar jeevon kaa vargeekaran kiya, lekin unhone samaan jatiyon ke bich sambandh ke bare main koi daawa nahin kiya
 
 At that time, it was still widely believed that no one among the castes believed that there was any biological connection between the biological castes, no matter how similar they looked
 This approach also suggested a kind of idealism: the notion that all the existing castes are an "ideal form"
 haalanki vahaan par sabhi jeevon ke bich hameshaa hi matbhed hai, to bhi linius ne aise antar ko samasyapurna mana
 unhone alag-alag jeevon kii pahchaan karne kaa prayaas kiya jo jatiyon kaa anukaraniya tha or anya gaiyr-anukaraniya jeevon asaamaanya or apurna mana
 By the 19th century most naturalists understood that caste could change from time to time, and that the history of the home gave enough time for major changes in them
 jin-baptist lamark ne Zoological Philosophy main sristi-rachana-siddhant ke viruddh pehla taarkik vichaar diya
 There was a new preference for determining how castes might change over time
 lamark ne suzav diya ki jeev kisi praapt gun ko apane aane vaale vansh main pahunchaa saktaa he jaise jiraph kii lambii gardan oonche pedo kii pattiyon tak pahunchnaa jiraph kii peedi kaa gun tha
 However, with Charles Darwin's acceptance of the natural selection idea in 1860, Lanmark's approach to goal-oriented development, also known as the teleological process, was rendered ineffective
 pashchjanan sambandhi prakriyaayein jaise mithailation ke aas-paas praapt visheshtaon ke vanshanukram main haal hi kii ruchi jo DNA kram ko prabhavit nahin karti, lekin viraasatiya tareeke se abhivyakti ko badla ja saktaa he
 Thus, neo-lamarckism, as it has sometimes been talked about, that the theory of evolution is not a challenge with natural selection
 charles darwin or alfred veles vah vichaar diya jiskaa paalan aaj bhi vaigyanik vikaas ke siddhant kaa sabase shaktishaalee or sammohak rup main karte hai
 Darwin argued that this included population was not just a creature
 unka tark linius kii kattarpanthi dhara ke pariprekshya kii tulana main adhik vishwasaneey he:jati kii vyakhya adarsh shabd ke rup main karne kii bajaay, darwin ne jeevon ke bich antar ko prakritik mana
 unhone aage tark diya ki samasyagrastata se dur durlabh jati ke astitv ke liye vastav main uskaa spashtikaran kiya
 Darwin's work drew on Thomas Malthus' insight that the growth rate of organic populations would always be ahead of the growth rate of resources in the environment, such as the supply of food
 As a result, Darwin argued that not all organisms in the population would be able to subsist and breed

 In this way, adaptive variations will accumulate in the population over many generations, while the hostile traits will disappear

 In this model, the neck length of a giraffe would be interpreted according to the situation that the long-necked proto-giraffe acquired special reproductive traits from the short-necked giraffe
 For many generations, the entire population would have belonged to long-necked animals
 
 1859 main, jab darwin ne prakritik chayan kaa apana siddhant prakashit kiya, to us samay vanshanukram ke vyaktigat gunon vaale tantra kaa gyaan nahin tha
 Although Darwin made some assumptions about inheritance of virtue, his theory was based only on the fact that inheritance properties exist and are mutable
 haalanki grager mendal anuvanshiki par shodh-patr ko uski visheshtaon kii pahchaan kiye bina hi 1866 main prakashit kiya gaya tha
 This was not done until 1900 when his work was rediscovered by Hugo de Verais, Carl Correns, and Erick von Semark, when they realized that Darwin's theory had "inherited properties" genes
 prakritik chayan ke madhyam se vikaas kii jatiyon ke vargeekaran main jatiyon kii charchaa ke liye do mahatvapurn manyataayen he - ve parinaam lineyas kii texonomi ke paksh main anumaanon ko moolbhoot rup se chunauti detii hai
 At first it showed that castes are not only the same but they can also be really related
 darwin ke kuch chaatro kaa tark he ki sabhi jatiyaan aam purvaj kii vanshaj hai
 Second, it is assumed that "caste" is not homogeneous, stable, permanent things; Caste members are completely different and castes have changed a long time ago
 is baat se pataa chalata he ki jatiyon kii koi vishesh seemaa kshetra nahin he lekin lagaataar badalati jin-aavritiyon ke sankhyikeey prabhaav padate hai
 Still, one can use the classification of Linnaeus to identify plants and animals, but no one can think of an independent and immutable form of castes anymore
 paitruk vansh se kisi nai jati main vikaas hona speshiation kehalaata he
 The progeny caste has no clear lineage demarcation from its descendant caste
 haalanki jatiyon ke vartmaan vaigyanik gyaan se yah pataa chalaa he ki sabhi maamalon main vibhinn jatiyon ke bich antar sthapit karne ke liye koi thos or vyapak tarika nahin he, taaki jeev vigyaani is vichaar ke sanchaalan ko jari rakhane ke liye thos tareekon kii talash jari rakhen

 Intuitive castes have limitations in this definition, but are incomplete
 udhaaharan ke liye un jati ke bare main kuch nahin kahana he jo alangik tareeke se prajnan karte hai or use vilupt hoti ja raheen jatiyon par lagu karnaa bada mushkil he
 In addition, the boundaries between castes are often unclear: there are instances where members of a particular population breed fertile hybrid offspring of creatures from a second population and members of a second population cultivate fertile hybrids from creatures with a third population
 Can breed offspring but members of the first and third populations cannot breed fertile hybrids or only fertile offspring from parents Birth is possible
 natijatan, kuch log jati kii is paribhaasha ko asweekaar karte hai
 Richard Dakins describes the two organisms as homogeneous and if they have the same number of chromosomes and for each chromosome, both creatures have the same number of chromosomes
 However, most all classification scientists will disagree with this point
 udhaaharan ke liye, kai ubhaycharon main, vishesh rup se newjiland main, leopelma mendhakon ke jinom main "mul" jinom hote hai jo bilkul bhinn nahin hote or gaun gunasutra hote hai jo bahut se sanyojanon main maujuud hai
 Although extreme differences are found in the number of chromosomes of the population, they can successfully differentiate and form a single developmental unit

 Classification of species is particularly affected by technological advances that allowed researchers to link their evidence based on molecular traces, to acute evidence of crude blood plasma, in the mid-20th century ground-breaking DNA-DNA hybridization study of Charles Sibley, In 1970, the comparison gave rise to DNA sequencing techniques

 DNA is only the rarer direct target of natural selection rather than a change in DNA sequence during generations on the latter outcome; For example, the silent transit-substitution combination would alter the melting point of the DNA sequence, but not the sequence of the encoded protein, and for example where for microorganisms, the changes in themselves consider changes in their fitness

 is kaa prabhaav kaan, naak or haath pair kii ungliyon par padataa he
 Knowledge of first aid of this disease is very important for the soldiers who guard the mountain range
 jis ang kii twachaa par tusharrog kaa prabhaav ho usko aaraam se rakhana chahie tathaa saaf karne ke baad oonee kapade se lapet dena chahie
 Massage and fomentation are harmful
 adhik sheet ke kaaran kuch logon ke hath pair kii ungliyaan sooj jaati hai, laal pad jaati hai or unamem ghaav bhi ho jate hai
 To avoid this disease, nutritious food should be taken and fingers should be kept warm by wearing gloves
 yahan paushtik bhojan se taatpary adhik protein or vasayukta bhoj se he
 Chemical substances such as alkali and acid etc
 have a bad effect on the skin
 bharat samprati audyogikaran kii ore agrasar ho rahaa he, atev anek prakaar ke rasinic padaarthon kaa prayog anivaary he
 In such a situation, many skin diseases will be visible due to ill effects of these chemicals on the skin
 aadhunik samay main anya deshen main vyavsaayik twacharongon kii ore adhik dhyaan diya ja rahaa he
 While entering labor in an industrial organization, it is seen that the chemicals that are used in that industrial organization are not harmful to the workers
 duusari baat yah he ki aisi audyogic sansthaaon ke prabandhak evam chikitsak yah bhi dekhte hai ki samast karmchaaree uchit prakaar se haath paanv dhote hai or kaam ke pashchaat apane kapade badalte hai athwa nahin
 The clothes they wear and use chemicals should be changed immediately after work, so that the bad effects of those substances on the body do not last long
 aajkal pragatisheel deshon main audyogic sansthaayen in samast baton par puraa puraa dhyaan rakhti hai or is baat par bhi dhyaan detii hai ki kaarkaanon kii twachaa par bura prabhaav na daal saken

 Most of the skin diseases are seen in our country, which occur due to not cleaning the body completely, poverty, non-continuous bathing and touching of the skin of diseased animals
 is prakaar ke rog chhot ke rog hote hai or ek duusare ke sansarg se lag jate hai
 Most of such diseases are itching, lice and ringworm etc
 log yah sochate hai ki in rogon ke jeevanuon ko maarane ke liye teevr se teevr aushadhiyon kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 This idea is pure and wrong
 aisa karne se twachaa ko bahut haani pahunchati he
 People should know that all those diseases, in which itching is a common prefix, occur due to different reasons
 khaaj ke liye gandhak kaa maraham bahut laabhadaayak he
 a doctor is needed for complete diagnosis of the disease
 gandhak ke maraham ko sharir par raat main lagaakar sona chahie
 Applying ointment thrice would be enough
 sir kii juun se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye sir kii safai karnaa tathaa baalo ko katwanaa chahie or di
di
tii
 yaa anya aushadhiyon kaa prayog chikitsak kii sanmati ke anusaar karen
 To get rid of itching and lice, other things do not benefit as much from the above mentioned medicines
 daad par aisa maraham na lagaana chahie, jo twachaa ko haani pahunchaae
 The disease is more commonly seen in sweaty areas
 is kaaran aise sthanon ko powder dwaara sookhaa rakhana chahie
 Also, ointment and powder should be used continuously for some time even after the curing of ringworm

 It is very beneficial for the disease
 ye rog kabhi kabhi pakanevaali khujali ke rup main hote hai or hamaari twachaa par jo jeevanu mitra ke samaan rahete hai, shatru ho jate hai
 Penicillin and sulfa ointment, such as cibazole, are harmful to kill these bacteria
 twachaa par rahanevaale jeevanu adhiktar apane aap hi twachaa ke rog kaa kaaran ho jate hai, jo phode, fusiyon ke rup main prakat hota he
 All these bacteria are hidden in a hiding place, such as a nose
 is kaaran yah aavashyak he ki chikitsa ke samay inpar bhi dhyaan diya jaay
 In the treatment of these diseases, food and medicine should be used
 jis jagah kii twachaa par ye rog prakat hon uski safai kaa puraa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 For these diseases, an ointment, wherein the doctor mixes zinc oxide, hydamon, iodoxiclavin, etc
, should be applied, and the use of sulfa and antibiotics by mouth, or by injection

 This effect makes the skin very soft and sensitive and takes the form of eczema, or dermatitis, or urticaria
 in rogon kii uchit chikitsa ke liye yah jaananaa aavashyak he ki twachaa kis cheez se prabhavit hui he
 In the present period, many things affect the skin, among which the barber razor and the radiant things are the main ones
 twachaa hamaare sharir ke liye darpan ke samaan he, jisapar hansee, prasannataa, du:kha tathaa khinnata kaa prabhaav turant padataa he
 The reason for thirst is mental discomfort and sleeplessness
 twachaa par anya angon ke rog kaa bhi prabhaav padataa he, jaise madhumeh or pilia rogon main sharir par khujali ho jaati he

 bhinn bhinn rogon ke liye anek davaayen di jaati hai
 New medicines are used every day
 bhinn bhinn aushadhiyon kaa adhik prayog kane se bhi tvagrog hota he, jise drug rash yaa drug chakatta kehete hai
 Skin diseases can also occur due to less sweating
 isi prakaar charbi kii granthi se bhi rog hote hai
 One of these diseases is called Muhansa, which is often seen in young boys and girls
 vastut: yah rog nahin he
 Due to the functioning of the sex glands at this age, the fat glands automatically produce fat
 jisko muhaanse kaa rog he use meetha, mirch tathaa masala kam khaanaa chahie
 Acne should not be scratched
 twachaa par bal bhi hote hai
 Sometimes the hairs of the head get more breakage
 iske liye sir kii safai or kisi sade tel kaa prayog laabhkar siddh hota he
 Sometimes young boys, the hair of the wood turns white at an early age, due to which they remain unhappy
 parantu abhi tak koi aushadhi aisi gyaat nahin ho pai he jiske prayog se yah rog thik ho sake
 Sometimes there is a possibility of causing great harm by applying Khizab etc
 kabhi kabhi sir yaa dadhi ke bal jagah jagah se ud jate hai
 Perhaps the reason for this is anxiety
 yadi rogi ko vishwaas dilaate rahen ki ude hue bal pun: aa jaayenge, to isse laabh hota he
 It is necessary to describe the skin as well as the nail
 nakhun main bhi twachaa ke samaan daad ho sakati he
 Sometimes nail polish breaks the nails quickly or becomes rough
 iske atirikt chintaa bhi twachaa kaa rog paidaa kar detii he
 The whitening of the skin is called white spots
 abhaagyavash isko kodh samajha jaataa he
 This makes the patient more anxious
 is rog main twachaa ko rooyee se chune se bhi sooyee chhedne jaisi pidaa hone lagati he
 But there is no pain in leprosy
 abhi tak is rog kii koi santoshjanak chikitsa gyaat nahin ho saki he
 Tuberculosis germs in the skin also produce dermatophytosis
 isi prakaar upadansh ke dhabbe bhi twachaa par prakat hote hai
 There are some skin diseases that reappear, such as psoriasis, the exact cause of which is unknown
 lupas arethematosus bhi aisa hi rog he
 If treated properly, most skin diseases are cured
 twachaa ke thode hi rog aise hote hai, jinase mrityu hoti he, jaise penfigus 
 In this disease, there are blisters on the body, mouth and secretions
 bhagyavash is rog main cotircesteroid se ek naveen aashaa utpann ho gai he or rog par bahut kuch aadhipaty paa liya gaya he, kintu rogi ko jivan bhar alp maatra main iskaa prayog karte rahanaa chahie
 Cancer can occur in every part of the body
 twachaa main bhi cancer ho saktaa he
 If the disease is diagnosed early and benefits from surgery, deep x-ray, radium or other treatment, then the age of the patient increases

 The Bhagavad Gita begins with the word Dharma and the sermon given in the last chapter of the Bhagavad Gita is called Dharma Samvad
 dharm kaa arth he 1- dhaaran karne vaala 2- jise dhaaran kiya gaya he
 The one who holds is called the soul and the one who holds it is nature
 dharm kaa arth bhagavadgita main jeev swabhaav arthath prakruti he, kshetra kaa arth sharir se he
 This is confirmed in other episodes of the Bhagavad Gita
 yatha ‚Äòswadharme nidhanam shreyah par dharmah paradharmah bhayavahah‚Äô, apane swabhaav main sthit rahanaa, usamen maranaa hi kalyaan kaarak mana he
 This religion is very important in the Gita Shastra
 shri bhagwaan ne saamaanya manushya ke liye swadharm paalan arthath swabhaav ke aadhaar par jivan jeena param shreyaskar dharm bataaya he
 Maharishi Vyas was a theologian
 unki drushti se dharm kaa arth he aatma or kshetra kaa arth he sharir
 From this point of view in the first verse of the Bhagavad Gita, the distraught Dhritarashtra asks the son Mohoo, o Sanjay, what did me and the Pandu sons do to wish for war in Kurukshetra, where there is presence in the form of Lord Shri Krishna, in the body of the real religion ? At the end of the Gita, this sermon was called by God himself as Dharma Samvad
 dharm arthath jisane dhaaran kiya he, vah aatmatatv paramatma sharir rup main jahaan upasthit he, yah brahmarshi vyas ji ke chintan main rahaa hoga
 atah vyas ji dwaara bhagavadgita main dharm kshetra shabd kaa prayog sristi ko dhaaran karne vaale paramatma shri krishna chandra tathaa dhritarasht ke jeev bhav ko sangyaan main lete hue dharmakshetre shabd kaa prayog kiya he
 This is also confirmed by 'dharma Sansthanarthaya'
 sandarbh - basanteshwari bhagavadgita -pro basant The oldest grammar of Sanskrit is called 'vedic grammar'
 yah panineey vyakaran se kuch bhinn tha
 There are mainly two sections of major literature written in Sanskrit - Vedic literature and Cosmic literature
 vaidic sahitya ke mukhyatah paanch vibhaag hai- Kalpasutra which is mainly of three types ye teen prakaar ke sutara ‚Äòkalpasutra‚Äô ke antargat liye jate hai
 In addition to this, the Shulvasutras which employ Yagvedi related lineal forms and for this reason are sometimes counted within the Kalpasutras
 uparyukt kalpasutron ke atirikt kuch or bhi granth hai jinka sambandh dhwani, vigyaan, vyakaran, chand or nakshatravidya se he
 These texts are enumerated in Vedangas
 ye granth bhi sutara-style main hi milte hai or inkaa samay he vaidic evam loukik sanskrit kaa sandhikaal
 a variety of distinctions of secular Sanskrit literature from Vedic literature is found
 vaidic sahitya shuddhtah dharmik he tathaa is main sabhi loukik tattvon kaa beej samahit he
 Cosmic Sanskrit literature can be said to be primarily religious-secular, or in religion it is related to the folk-world
 is sahitya main mahakavy, puraana evam anya kavy naatak, alankarishastra, darshan, sutara, vidhi athwa niyamkala, vaastushastra, aushadhi, ganit, mashin tathaa udyog sambandhi tathaa anekon granth or anya vibhinn vidyaon kii shakhaaen bhi praapt hoti hai
 There is also a difference between the language of cosmic literature and the language of Vedic literature
 donon ke shabdarup tathaa dhaaturup anek prakaar se bhinn hai
 The forms of Vedic Sanskrit are not only different but also many, especially those forms which are related to the forms of verb forms and metals
 is sambandh main donon saahitiyon kii kuch mahatvapurn bhinnataayen nimnlikhit hai :- For example, in cosmic terms, only such forms are formed in cosmic Sanskrit, as Devaah, Janaah
 jabaki vaidic sanskrit main inamen rup devasah, janaamah bhi banate hai
 Similarly, the form ‚Äòvishwani‚Äô in the first and second divination plurals also becomes ‚Äòvishva‚Äô in Vedic literature
 tritiya vibhakti bahuvachan main vaidic sanskrit main ‚Äòdevai‚Äô ke saath-saath ‚Äòdevebhih‚Äô bhi miltaa he
 Similarly, 'vyomni' or 'vyomani' forms are found in the Saptami Vibhakti singular as well as 'vyoman' in Vedic Sanskrit
 vaidic tathaa loukik sanskrit main kriyaroopon or dhaaturupon main bhi vishesh antar he
 Vedic Sanskrit is somewhat more prosperous in this subject and has some other forms of achievement
 jabaki loukik sanskrit main kriya padon kii avasthaa batalaane vaale aise keval do hi lakaar hai- lot or vidhilin joki latprakruti arthath vartmaankaal kii dhaatu se banate hai
 For example, both Pathatu and Pathet are formed from Patha
 vaidic sanskrit main kriyaapadon kii avasthaa ko dyotit karne vaale do anya lakaar hai- let lakaar evam nishedhaatmak lulkaar 
 In the Vedic Sanskrit, the symbolism of these four stages is not only formed by lattice, but also from litt prakriti and lun prakriti
 is prakaar vaidic sanskrit main dhaaturup atyadhik maatra main hai
 Apart from this, the link suffixes are found in Vedic Sanskrit like 'minimasibhi' is used but in cosmic Sanskrit 'minimahi' is used
 jahaan tak dhaatu se bane hue anya roopon kaa prashn he, loukik sanskrit main keval ek hi ‚Äòtumun‚Äô miltaa he jabaki vaidic sanskrit main iske lagbhag ek darjan rup milte hai jaise gantvai, gamdhyai, jeevasai, daatvai ityadi
 PS, cosmic Sanskrit has become more and more artificial or compositional in the future and we find examples of it in the horrifying passages used in the prose of Subandhu and Banabhatta
 is kala main vah apane kshetra ke anya gadhyakaron se atyant utkrisht hai
 Some Vedic words are inaccessible in cosmic Sanskrit and some new words have also emerged
 udaahranarth, vaidic shabd ‚Äòaps‚Äô kaa ‚Äòkaary‚Äô ke arth main prayog loukik sanskrit main lupt ho gaya he
 The word 'family' used in secular Sanskrit is unavailable in Vedic Sanskrit
 yah vaidic evam loukik sanskrit kii apni visheshta he
 From the point of view of semantics, there has been a specific change in some words like 'ritu' which means 'shakti' in Vedic Sanskrit and it has become 'yajna' in Cosmic Sanskrit
 bhashaa main parivartan ke atirikt donon saahitiyon main kuch or bhinnataayen prapya hai- Firstly, as stated above, Vedic literature is predominantly religious while secular Sanskrit is related to every field of secular life as well as religion in terms of its narrative
 donon kii aatma yadhyapi abhinn he tathaapi abhinnata main bhi bhinnata ke darshan hote hai
 Vedic poetry, mainly as we find in the Rigveda and Atharvaveda, is optimistic while secular Sanskrit literature is pessimistic, this pessimism is also reflected in the 'all sorrows' of Buddhists
 baudhon ke vyavhaaryapaksh ‚Äòkarunaa‚Äô or ‚Äòmaitri‚Äô kaa udghosh bhi vaidic sahitya kii moulikta he
 The Vedic religion also appears to have developed a latent special significance in later times
 yahan tak ki vaidic yug ke pradhan devtaa jaise indra, agni, varun ko loukik sanskrit main apekshaakrit vishistataa praapt nahin hui parantu brahma, vishnu or shiv in teenon ko vedon main keval gaun sthaan hi praapt tha, parvarti kaal main inhen ek mahatvapurn sthaan praapt ho gaya
 During this period, some new gods and goddesses like Ganesh, Kubera, Lakshmi and Durga etc
 also developed from Vedic origin
 parvarti kaviyon main atyukti kaa aashray grahan karne kii ore adhik jhukaav he, jaise magh, sriharsh aadi main jabaki purvavarti kaviyon jaise ashwaghosh, bhaas or kalidas main atyukti kaa abhaav he
 There is a great lack of exaggeration in Vedic poetry
 loukik samskruti main chandobaddh roopon ke prayogon kii ore hamen ek vishisht aagrah dikhaayi detaa he
 In the Vedic era, there is a lot of versed forms, but prose is also used in the Yajna literature, especially in the Yajurveda and Brahmins
 loukik sanskrit kaal main chandobaddh roopon ke prayog kii ore itnaa adhik jhukaav he ki yahan tak ki vaidyak granth bhi padya main hi likhe gayi
 It is surprising that this dictionary was also composed in verses
 kuch aage chalakar parvarti kaal main baan or subandhu ne gadhy kaavyon ke lekhan kii style kaa vikaas kiya, jo bade-bade samaason se mishrit hone ke kaaran atyant kritrim kahi jaati he
 Apart from this, the system of writing philosophical texts in the form of a formula in the preceding period also came into vogue
 aage chalakar hamen chhandon kii pranali kaa bhi ek parivartan drushtigochar hota he
 Vedic verses Jagati, Trishubha, Anushtubha are completely unavailable in cosmic Sanskrit
 jabaki loukik sanskrit ke chand vanshastha, upendravajra, shikharini aadi vedon main purnatah aprapya hai
 Yes, it is definitely true that the verses used in secular Sanskrit are verses of Vedic Anushtubha
 vaidic evam loukik sanskrit kii bhinnataaon kii ore drushtipaat karte hue yah dhyaan dena aavashyak he ki siddhant kii drushti se donon ek duusare se kaaphi milti-julati hai
 Some more sounds are found in the Vedas, such as ‡§≥ '
 anya dhwani-siddhanth donon ke samaan hi hai or unamem koi bhi vaisaa antar nahin dikhaayi detaa jaisaa ki praakrit boliyon main hamen praapt hota he
 A-car is the largest class of noun
 niyamanusaar is varg se sambandhit sangyaayen hrisv- a par khatm hoti hai, yaa to pu yaa fir napus
 deergh-aa par khatm hone vaali sangyaayen adhiktar stri hote hai
 This class is very large because it includes pre-hind-european o-car
 ri-car kaa prayog ri ant vaale shabdon jaise napusak
 datra 'denevaala', pu
 pitru 'baap', naptri 'bhatija' or stri
 matra 'maan', duhitri 'beti' or swasri 'bahan'
 Rigvedic language is different from Sanskrit language as Homeric Greek is different from classical Greek
 tiwari ne donon ke bich antar ko nimna siddhant swaroop suchit kiya: The basic method is given in the table below - valid and rational for almost all nouns and adjectives
 Nevertheless, according to the final consonant / vowel of gender and syllable, there are some predetermined formulas of the obligatory pact that make up the last common word
 Separate suffixes will be given for eunuchsling, for the rest of the male and female
 Where there will be two or three forms, there will be the first child, but the second and third woman

 In the Mahabharata, there are accounts of the war between the Kauravas and the Pandavas, mainly of two families of lunar dynasties

 mahabharat yuddh hone kaa mukhya kaaran kauravon kii ucch mahatvakankshaayen or dhritarashtra kaa putr moh tha
 The Kauravas and the Pandavas were siblings
 vedavyas ji se niyog ke dwaara vichitraveery kii bharya ambika ke garbh se dhritarashtra or ambalika ke garbh se pandu utpann hue
 Dhritarashtra gave birth to a hundred sons from Gandhari's womb, Duryodhana being the eldest
 pandu ke yudhisthir, bhim, arjuna, nakul, sahadev aadi paanch putr hue| dhritarashtra janm se hi netraheen the atah unki jagah par pandu ko raaj diya gaya jisase dhritarashtra ko sadaa pandu or uske putron se dwesh rahane laga
 This malice flourished as Duryodhana and Shakuni made ghee in this fire
 shakuni ke kehane par duryodhana ne bachapan se lekar laakshagrih tak kai shadyantra kiye
 But every time he failed
 yuvavastha main aane par jab yudhisthir ko yuvaraj bana diya gaya to usne unhen laakshagrih bhijwakar maarane kii koshish kii parantu pandav batch nikle
 In the absence of the Pandavas, Dhritarashtra made Duryodhana the crown prince, but when the Pandavas returned and sought their kingdom back, they were given a ruined Khandav forest in the name of the state
 dhritarashtra ke anurodh par grihayuddh ke sankat se bachane ke liye yudhisthir ne yah prastaav bhi sweekaar kar liya
 The Pandavas built Indraprastha, the grand city of Indra's Amaravati Puri, with the help of Shri Krishna
 pandavon ne vishwavijay karke prachur maatra main ratna evam dhan ekatrit kiya or rajasuya yajna kiya
 Duryodhana could not see the progress of the Pandavas and with the help of Shakuni, he won his entire kingdom from Yudhishthira in gaming and humiliated Draupadi by attempting to disarm Draupadi in the Kuru Rajya Sabha
 sambhavtah isi din mahabharat ke yuddh ke beej pad gayi the
 Finally, after losing in gaming, the Pandavas had to accept confinement for 12 years and one year of exile
 parantu jab yah shart puri karne par bhi kauravon ne pandavon ko unka rajya dene se manaa kar diya
 So the Pandavas had to be interrupted to fight, but Shri Krishna suggested to do everything possible to stop the war
 tab shrikrishna pandavon kii taraf se kururajya sabha main shantidoot banakar gayi or vahaan shrikrishna ne duryodhana se pandavon ko keval paanch gaanv dekar yuddh taalane kaa prastaav rakhaa
 But when Duryodhana refused to give the Pandavas as much land as the needle point, Yudhishthira was eventually forced to fight
 is prakaar kauravon ne 11 akshuhinee tathaa pandavon ne 7 akshuhinee sena ekatrit kar lee
 After completing the preparations for the war, both the Kaurava and the Pandavas reached Kurukshetra, where this fierce battle was fought, that terrible and fierce exterminatorial war of Kurukshetra can be inferred from a verse in Bhishma festival of Mahabharata
 bhrata bhraataram tatra swasriyan na c matulah
 Even after fulfilling the condition of 12 years of life and 1 year of unknown life, when the Kauravas refused to give their kingdom to the Pandavas, the Pandavas were forced to fight
 parantu shrikrishna ne kaha ki yah yuddh sampoorn vishwa sabhyataa ke vinaash kaa kaaran ban saktaa he atah unhone yuddh rokane kaa har sambhav prayaas karne kaa suzav diya
 Sri Krishna said that Duryodhana must give one last chance, so Sri Krishna went on behalf of the Pandavas as a peacekeeper in the Kurujya Sabha and proposed to avoid war by giving Duryodhana only five villages in front of the Pandavas
 jab duryodhana ne pandavon ko sui kii nonk jitani bhi bhoomi dene se manaa kar diya to shrikrishna ne use samajhaayaa ki duryodhana ke is hath ke kaaran uske vansh or saathiyon ke saath-saath kai nirdosh logon ko yuddh kii bali chadhana padegaa
 Enraged at this, Duryodhana tried to make Sri Krishna a prisoner, but Shri Krishna used Maya to frighten everyone out of his vast form and left
 iske baad to yudhisthir ko yuddh karne ke liye vivash hona hi padaa
 At the same time, Lord Ved Vyas went to Dhritarashtra and said that your sons, by disregarding the talk of all the gurus, finally put up a great destructive war
 dhritarashtra ke yuddh kii sansuchana jaanane kii vinati karne par vedavyas ji ne unhe kaha ki yadi tum is mahayuddh ko dekhnaa chaahate ho to main tumhen divya drushti pradaan kar saktaa hoon
 Dhritarashtra said that the destruction of my family is to be done in it, so i will not see this war with my own eyes
 atah aap krupa karke aisi vyavastha kar den ki mujhe is yuddh kaa samachar miltaa rahe
 Hearing this, Ved Vyas called Sanjay and gave him a divine vision and said, ‚Äúoh Dhritarashtra! i have given Sanjay a divine vision
 sampoorn yuddh kshetra main koi bhi baat aisi na rahegi jo isse chuphi rahe
 This will tell you the whole story of this great war
 ‚Äù itnaa kahkar vedavyas ji chale gayi
 When it was decided that there would be war, both sides started preparations for war
 duryodhana pichle 13 varshon se hi yuddh kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha, usne balram ji se gada yuddh kii shiksha praapt kii tathaa kathin parishram or abhyaas se gada yuddh karne main bhim se bhi acha ho gaya
 Shakuni turned most of the districts of the world in these years
 duryodhana karn ko apni sena kaa senapati bananaa chahta tha parantu shakuni ke samajhane par duryodhana ne pitamah bhishma ko apni sena kaa senapati banaaya, jiske kaaran bharat or vishwa ke kai janapad duryodhana ke paksh me ho gayi
 On the Pandavas side, only those districts were in favor of religion and Shri Krishna
 mahabharat ke anusaar mahabharat kaal main kururajya vishwa kaa sabase bada or shaktishaalee janapad tha
 All the districts of the world never made the mistake of going to war with Kurujya and maintained a cordial relationship
 at: sabhi janapad kuruon dwaara labhanvit hone ke lobh se yuddh main unki sahaayta karne ke liye taiyaar ho gayi
 When the Pandavas and Kauravas asked for help from the Yadavas, Sri Krishna first vowed not to take up arms in the war and then said that "on one side i am alone and on the other side i have an Akshauhini Narayani army", now Arjuna and Duryodhana elect one of these Had to do
 arjuna ne to shrikrishna ko hi chunaa, tab shrikrishna ne apni ek akshuhinee sena duryodhana ko de di or khud arjuna kaa sarathi bananaa sweekaar kiya
 In this way, the Kauravas collected 11 Akshauhini and the Pandavas collected 7 Akshauhini army
 phir shrikrishna ne karn se milakar use yah samajhaayaa ki vah pandavon kaa hi bhai he atah vah pandavon kii taraf se yuddh kare, parantu karn ne duryodhana ke rin or mitrataa ke kaaran kauravon kaa saath nahin choda
 After this, on requesting Kunti, Karna promised not to kill Arjuna except for the remaining four of his sons when he got the opportunity
 idhar indra ne bhi brahman kaa vesh banaakar karn se uske kavach or kundal le liye
 Due to which the power of Karna was reduced and the enthusiasm of the Pandavas increased because Karna could not be killed by any diva due to that impenetrable armor
 pandavon or kauravon ne apni sena ke kramshah 7 or 11 vibhaag akshuhinee main kiye
 An Akshauhini consists of 21, 870 chariots, 21, 870 elephants, 65, 610 riders and 1,09,350 foot soldiers
 yah pracheen bharat main sena kaa maap hua karata tha
 Each chariot consists of four horses and their charioteer
 Each elephant sits on its elephant, and behind it is its assistant who curbs the elephant from behind the chair, its owner in the chair is fitted with a bow and arrow and with it his two companions There are those who throw spears
 Accordingly the number of people who ride on chariots and elephants are 2, 84, 323
 All the living beings in an Akshohini army - elephants, horses and humans - Mr
 Print 6, 34, 243 happen, so 18 akshauhini total number of all Jivdharion- elephants, horses and men in army-1, will be 14, 16, 374
 atharah akshuhiniyon ke liye yahi sankhya 11, 416 ,374 ho jaati he arthath 3, 93, 660 hathi, 27, 55, 620 ghode, 82, 67, 094 manushya
 Many types of weapons were used in the war of Mahabharata
 praas, rishti, tomars, lohamay kanap, chakra, mudgar, naraach, farse, gofan, bhushundi, shatghni, dhanush-baan, gada, bhaalaa, talwaar, parigh, bhindipal, shakti, musal, kampan, chaap, divyastra, ek saath kai baan chhodane vaali yantric mashine
 Weapons of ancient bronze age kaansya yug kii talwaar 1800 BC iron arrow piece found in excavation in Dadupur village of Lucknow ek saath kai baan chhodane vaali yantric mashine In ancient times, during the time of war, the commander had to make many arrays of army so that the enemy's army could be easily penetrated and the king and the chief generals could be captured or killed
 isamen apni sampoorn sena ko vyuh ke naam yaa gun vaali ek vishesh akruti me vyavasthit kiya jaataa he
 With this type of array of composition, even the smallest army can appear to be huge and can face the largest army as in the battle of Mahabharata, only 7 Akshohini army of Pandavas proved this by facing 11 Akshauhini army of Kaurava
 Shown
 mahabharat ke 18 din ke yuddh main donon paksh ke senapatiyon dwaara kai prakaar ke vyuh banaaye gaye
 Which are as follows- chakravyuuh ke gathan kaa chithran Ancient Shilachitra depicting Abhimanyu entering the Chakra array yuddh kii taiyaariyaan purna karne ke baad kaurav or pandav donon dal kurukshetra pahanche
 The Pandavas made their halt near the banks of Hiranyavati River, far away from the Samantpanchak Tirtha, situated on the southern bank of the Saraswati River in the western region of Kurukshetra, and the Kauravas made a halt in the eastern part of Kurukshetra at a plain level a few miles away
 
 donon pakshon ne vahaan chikne or samtal pradeshon me jahaan ghaas or eendhan kii adhikta thi, apni sena kaa padaav daalaa
 Yudhishthira set up thousands of military camps near the banks of the Hiranyavati River not far from the ashrams of the Devandirs, Tirthas and Maharishi
 vahaan prayek shivi main prachur maatra main khaadya saamagree, astr-shastr, yantra or kai vaidya or shilpi vetan dekar rakhe gayi
 Duryodhana also made thousands of stops in the same way, only the siege of 5 plan was left for war between the two armies
 phir agle din praatah donon paksho kii senaayen ek duusare ke aamane-saamne aakar khadi ho gayin
 The Pandavas put their army stop near the Samantra Panchak Tirtha and the Kauravas made their stop seeing the best and level place
 us sangram main hathi, ghode or rathon kii koi gananaa nahin thi
 On the advice of Pitamah Bhishma, both parties gathered and made some rules of war
 unke banaaye hue niyam nimnlikhit hai- In this way, by making war rules, both parties presented for war
 pandavon ke paas saat akshuhinee sena thi or kauravon ke saath gyaarah akshuhinee sena thi
 The armies of the two sides stood facing east and west
 kauravon kii taraf se bhishma or pandavon kii taraf se arjuna sena kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahe the
 Only the armies of both sides were standing in the circle of the area of only 5 plan of Kurukshetra
 yuddh se purv arjuna shrikrishna se apane rath donon senaaon ke madhya main le jane ko kehete hai jisase vah yah dekh le ki yuddh main use kin kin yoddhaon kaa saamana karnaa he
 When Arjun sees his Guru Drona, Pitamah Bhishma and other relatives in the battle field, he becomes very sad and sad
 vah shrikrishna se kahata he ki jinke liye ham ye saare rajbhog praapt karnaa chaahate hai, ve to yahan is yuddh kshetra main usee rajbhog kii prapti ke liye hamaare vipaksh me khadey hai inhen markar ham raaj praapt karke bhi kya karegein
 Therefore, i will not fight, saying that Arjuna sits on the back of the chariot with his bow, then Sri Krishna is situated in yoga and gives him knowledge of the Gita and says that what has come in the world will have to go one day or the other
 yah sharir or sansar donon nashwar hai parantu is sharir ke andar rahane vaala aatma sharir ke marane par bhi nahin marataa
 Just as a person renounces old clothes and wears new clothes, similarly, the soul also abandons the old body and takes on a new body
 Think of it as if all this nature is getting you done, you are just an instrument
 shrikrishna arjuna ko gyaan yoga,bhakthi yoga or karm yoga teenon kii shiksha dete hai jise sunakar arjuna yuddh ke liye taiyaar ho jaataa he
 According to the Mahabharata and other mythological texts, this war led to the decline of Vedic knowledge and many other great dynasties along with the descendants of India
 mahabharat main varnit is yuddh ke kuch mukhya parinaam nimna likhit hai- Negative fruit sakaaratmak fal Based on the list of ancient dynasties given in Hindu traditions and Puranas and the astrological calculations given in other Vedic texts, the ancient Indian dynasty after Mahabharata period is the following in the historical chronology
 galtundika maanav ke gale ke pichley hisse main sthit ek ang he
 It is a type of tissue that acts as the first line of defense against invasion from external microbes
 galaa hamaare sharir kaa ek mahatvapurn ang he
 Its importance is clear from this point that it is the responsibility of the food and air entering the body
 isi mahatvapurn kaary ko nibhaane ke kaaran yahi hissaa hamaare dwaara grahan kiye jane vaale bhojan, jal tathaa vaayu main upasthit kisi bhi jahrile tatv se sabase pehle prabhavit hota he
 The nose and ears are also not untouched by this
 haalanki bahari rup se dekhne se hamaare naak, galaa va kaan alag‚àíalag dikhaai dete hai parantu gale ke bheetar jaakar in teenon angon kii koshikaayen aapas main mil jaati hai
 For this reason, if any type of infection occurs in any one of these three organs, then it affects all three organs
 is kaaran jaruri he ki koi bhi sankraman hote hi jaldi se uskaa upachaar kiya jaae
 In order to protect these organs from infection of any poisonous element present in the external environment, nature has designed the mouth and throat in such a way that those toxic elements have no effect on the internal system of our mouth
 bahari rup main dekhne par naak va mukh ek sampoorn ang ke rup main hi dikhaai dete hai, unke alag‚àíalag hisse dikhaai nahin dete
 But in fact these organs are divided into many parts
 haalanki nitalacavity marottege or netleceptor dekhne main to alag‚àíalag dikhaai dete hai parantu peeche jaakar gale kii andar aapas main ek cavity main mil jate hai jise 'oropheringells' kehete hai
 The posterior part of the nose above the oropharyngeals is called the 'lezoferringles'
 tonsil kii samasya kaa kaaran kisi bhi prakaar kaa sankraman yaa infections ho saktaa he jo hamaare sharir main mukh va naak se pravesh kar rahaa ho
 These pollution or infection can cause immediate problems when air contaminated with any type of viral or bacterial pollutants enters the body through the breath
 aise sthaan jahaan ke vaataavaran main badboo, sillen tathaa anya kisi rasinic tatv kaa samavesh ho aise sthanon main vaayu ke dwaara nirantar jahrile tatwon ke sampark main aane ke kaaran tonsil rog kii samasya khadi ho sakati he
 More cases of this disease are seen in children because their immunity is less
 aisa nahin ki badi umr ke log isse grasit nahin ho sakate unamem bhi yah samasya dekhi ja sakati he
 Tonsillitis is a dangerous condition of the disease because the body reacts due to antibodies
 is avasthaa main jaise hi antigen hamaare sharir main pravesh karata he vaise hi tonsil tishyu usase ladanaa shuru kar dete hai isse jo antigen banataa he vah sharir ke anya bhaagon main upasthit protein ke saath pratikriya karke vahaan bhi isi prakaar ke antibadis bana detaa he
 These antibodies have a direct effect on the heart valves and pose a risk of heart valve deterioration
 tonsil to zyaadaatar bacchon ko hota he parantu iskaa dil par padane vaala dushprabhav kisi bhi umr main pad saktaa he
 Inadequate treatment of throat infections in childhood is also a cause of heart diseases in our country
 iske atirikt tonsil se bairaphengills epashish, neutrapheringles epashish jaisi bimaariyaan bhi ho sakati hai
 This problem arising due to disturbances in the mechanical structure of the body due to toxic elements can be identified by looking at some initial symptoms like- Frequent sore throat, sore throat, pain, recurrent fever etc
 yadi aise hi lakshan rogi ko baar‚àíbaar ho rahe hon
 For example, five or six times a year, he should have a tonsil operation done
 lager aaparishan main do se teen ghante kaa samay lagata he or bilkul cheer‚àífaad nahin hoti
 To avoid tonsils, it is important that children are given a balanced diet so that their body's immunity is strong
 sabase jaruri to yah he ki tonsil ke lakshan dikhte hi turant doctor se sampark karen
 The course of medicine given by the doctor should be completed
 aksar log thodaa sa aaraam milte hi dawaai band kar dete hai parantu aisa karnaa rog ko or adhik ugr bana detaa he
 During this disease, the patient has difficulty in swallowing food and water
 aise main bahut se log kam khate hai, yah thik nahin he
 Continue to serve soft or liquid foods to meet the needs of the patient's body
 isse sharir kii rog pratirohak kshamta bani rahati he
