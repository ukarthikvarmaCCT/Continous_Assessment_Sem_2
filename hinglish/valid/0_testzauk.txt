 TB infection begins when mycobacteria reach the lung follicles, where they invade and replicate endosomes of alveolar macrophages
 fefdon main sankraman kaa praathmik sthal jise "ghon focus" kehete hai, aam taur par yaa to upree hisse ke nichle lob yaa nichle hisse ke upree lob main sthit hota he
 Tuberculosis of the lungs may also occur through infection with blood flow
 yah simon focus ke rup main janaa jaataa he or aam taur par fefdon ke sheersh main paaya jaataa he
 This blood circulation can also spread infection to far-flung areas such as peripheral lymph nodes, kidneys, brain, and bones
 sharir ke sabhi bhaag rog se prabhavit ho sakate hai, haalanki agyaat kaarnon se yah dil, kankal tantra sambandhi mansapeshiyon, agnashay yaa thyroid ko behad kam prabhavit karata he
 Tuberculosis is classified as a granulomatous inflammatory disease
 macrophesso, tii limphocites, bi limphocites or fibroblast ve koshikaayen hai jo milakar grenuloma banaate hai jabaki limphosite, sankramit macrophesso ke chaaron ore hoti hai
 Granulomas inhibit the proliferation of mycobacteria and provide a local environment for the interplay of cells of the immune system
 jeevanu, grenuloma ke andar niskriy ho jate hai, jiske parinamswaroop avyakt sankraman hota he
 The development of abnormal cell death at the center of the tubercle is another feature of granuloma
 nagn ankhon se dekhne par, yah naram, safed paneer kii banaavat jaisaa hota he or casius necrosis kaha jaataa he
 If TB bacteria enter the bloodstream from an area of damaged tissue, they can spread throughout the body and form multiple centers of infection, all of which appear as small, white tubercles in the tissues
 yah tibi rog kaa ek gambhir rup he jo chote bacchon or echivi peedit logon main sabase adhik aam he, ise milliyari tapedic kaha jaataa he
 People suffering from this TB have a high mortality rate despite treatment

 Tissue destruction and necrosis are often balanced by healing and fibrosis
 prabhavit utak kaa sthaan chakatte or khaali jagah le leti he jo casial necrotic saamagree se bhari hoti he
 During active disease, some of these empty airways are connected to the bronchi and this material can come out in the form of phlegm
 inamen jivit bacteria hote hai, isaliye sankraman fail saktaa he
 Treatment with appropriate antibiotics can kill bacteria and make treatment possible
 thik ho jane par, prabhavit kshetra antat utakon dwaara pratisthapit ho jate hai
 Active tuberculosis is difficult to diagnose only on the basis of signs and symptoms, similarly diagnosing disease in people with weak immunity is difficult
 halanki tibi kaa nidaan un logon main kiya janaa chaiye jinamein fefdon ke rog ke chihn he yaa do se adhik saptaah se swaabhaavik lakshan hai
 Chest X-rays and several sputum cultures for acid fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation

 Blood tests performed to detect antibodies are not specific or sensitive, so they are not recommended

 The prevention and control of tuberculosis is mainly dependent on vaccination of newborns and appropriate treatment of active cases
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke sanshodhit upachaar pathya ke madhyam se kuch safalataa hasil hui he or maamalon kii sankhya main thodi si kami aayi he
 The only available vaccine in 2011 is Bacillus calmette-guérin, which is effective in childhood disease and provides inconsistent protection against lung TB

 However, the immunity provided by it begins to decline after ten years
 kyonki adhikansh canada, britain or sanyukt rajya america main tapedic asaamaanya he, bisiji keval ucch jokhim vaale logon ko diya jaataa he
 Because of the tuberculin skin test being falsely positive, the use of the vaccine is argued against and, therefore, is of no use in screening

 The World Health Organization declared TB a "global health emergency" in 1993, and in 2006 the Stop TB Partnership developed a global plan to prevent tuberculosis that aims to save 14 million lives between its beginnings to 2015

 The tuberculosis classification system developed by the American Thoracic Society is being used primarily in public health programs
 tibi ke upachaar main antibiotic dawaaon kaa upyog karke bacteria ko maaraa jaataa he
 Effective TB treatment is difficult due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacteria cell wall, which inhibits the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective
 do sabase adhik istemaal kii jane vaali antibiotic dawaayein isoniyazid or riffampisin hai or upachaar, lambey samay kaa ho saktaa he jisame kai mahine lag sakate hai
 An antibiotic is commonly used in the treatment of latent TB, while a combination of several antibiotics is used in active TB disease to reduce the risk of bacteria developing antibiotic resistance
 avyakt sankramanon se peedit logon ko baad main jivan main sakriy tibi rog ke viksit hone se bachaav ke liye bhi upachaar diya jaataa he
 Direct treatment, ie a healthcare provider, takes care that people take their medicines

 The evidence in support of this case is weak when compared to this practice and people taking the medicines on their own independently
 lekin upachaar ke mahatv ko, logon ko yaad dilaane ke tareeke prabhavi dikhaai dete hai
 In 2010, a suggested six-month treatment of newly started pulmonary tuberculosis used a combination of antibiotics like rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the first two months, and only rifampicin and isonizid in the subsequent four months
 
 jin maamalon main isoniyazid ke liye ucch pratirodh hota he, unamem baad ke chaar maahon main athembuttol joda ja saktaa he
 If tuberculosis occurs again, before determining treatment it should be tested to determine which antibiotic it is sensitive to
 yadi ek se adhik dawa pratirodhi tibi kaa pataa chalaa he to 18 se 24 maheenon ke liye kam se kam chaar prabhavi antibiotic dawaaon ke saath upachaar kii sifarish kii jaati he
 Primary resistance occurs when a person becomes infected with a stress resistant to TB

 Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is long and requires more expensive drugs
 emdiar tibi ko sarvaadhik prabhavi, pehali pankti kii tibi dawaaon riffampisin or isoniyazid ke prati pratirodhi ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 Largely drug resistant TB is also resistant to three or six classes of second-line drugs

 However, in most cases, a latent infection has no obvious symptoms

 Studies using M
 Tepadik's DNA finger printing show that re-infection in recurrent TB contributes more adequately to earlier thinking, estimating it to be reactivated in common areas of TB
 Contributes to more than 50% of cases

 Tuberculosis rates began to decline even before the introduction of streptomycin and other antibiotics due to improvements in public health, although the disease remained such a significant threat to public health that when the Medical Research Council was formed in Britain in 1913, So its initial focus was on tuberculosis research
 1946 main, antibiotic streptomicine ke vikaas ne tibi ke prabhavi upachaar or swasth karne ko vaastaviktaa pradaan kii
 Prior to the introduction of this drug, the only treatment was surgery, a "pneumothorax technique" in which the infected lung was isolated and "rested" to allow tuberculous lesions to heal
 emdiar tibi ke udbhav ne tibi sankraman ke upachaar main dekhbhaal ke aam taur par sweekaar kiye jane vaale maanakon ke bheetar shalyakriya ko phir se ek vikalp ke rup main prastut kiya he
 Current surgical interventions include the removal of pathological chest coaters in the lungs to reduce the number of bacteria and increase the exposure of the remaining bacteria to the drugs involved in the blood flow, thereby reducing the total bacterial load
 And the effectiveness of systemic antibiotic therapy is enhanced

 There is a lot of variation in the nature of a horoscope, the law of law and its form in other countries and cultures of the world, and in the systems of auspicious instructions
 akaash main do prakaar ke prakaash pind dikhaai dete hai
 The first ones which appear stable are called Nakshatras
 duusare ve jo nakshatron ke bich sadaa apana sthaan parivartit karte rahete hai, grah kehalaate hai
 The earth rotates from west to east on its axis every twenty four hours, due to which all the planets and constellations rise in the east and go to the west and are seen to be disturbed

 In these, some tarapunjas form figures like creatures
 raashiyon ke naam unheen jeevon ke anusaar- mesh, vrish, mithun, kark, singh, kanya, tula,, brishchik, dhanu makar, kumbh, min rakhe gaye hai
 Due to the daily movement of the Earth, the cycle of twelve zodiacs revolves around our horizon in twenty-four hours
 inamen jo raashi kshitij main lagi hoti he use lagn kehete hai
 Here the lagna and its zodiac signs and the planets like Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu, Ketu etc
 are the basic instruments of the horoscope
 lagn se aarambhkar in baarah rashiyaan ko dvaadvash bhav kehete hai
 Among these, the ascendant is local

 Now the question arises that all calculations are started from Ashwini nakshatra
 phir grahadasha kii gananaa krittika se kyon kii jaati he
 The fact is that our planetary prediction has been going on since our Nakshatra calculation started from Kritika
 maharishi garg ne vedikakaal main do swatantra nakshatra gananaaon kaa ullekh kiya he- ek krittikadi or duusari dhanishthadi

 At present, the system of the birth chart of the horoscope by doing twelve parts of the zodiac is not mentioned in the ancient Vedic literature of India
 kintu atharv jyotish main bahut pehle se hi is paddati ke mul tatv nihit hai
 In this, nine parts of the 27 constellations of the zodiac are considered as one part of each of the three constellations
 inamen pratham 'janm nakshatra', dasavaan 'karm nakshatra' tathaa unnisvan 'aadhaan nakshatra' mana gaya he
 The rest is considered to be Sampat, Vipat, Kshemya, Pratvar, Sadhak, Naidhan, Maitra and Param Maitra in the order, such as- inamen janm, sampat or naidhan arthath 1, 2 or 7, dwadash bhavvaali janmkundali ke 1, 2 or 8 sthanon se milte hai
 Atharva is the tenth Karma constellation in astrology
 aadhunik paddati main bhi dasham sthaan karm he
 This proves that the nine places in Atharva astrology are interwoven into some of the twelve places of the present horoscope, which existed in our method of preaching before the introduction of nouns like Aries
 purv kshitij main laganevaale nakshatron ko lagn nakshatra maanane kaa varnan 3300 varsh pracheen vedang jyotish main bhi he
 Such as - Sravishtabhyo Gunabhyastan Pragvilagnan Specificand
 arthath gun teen kii gananaa kar ghanishta se purv kshitij main lage nakshatron ko bataanaa chahie
 From this it becomes clear that at that time the nine parts of the Nakshatra Chakra were done by dividing three into 27 Nakshatras
 atharv jyotish ke nav vibhaagon kaa saamanjasy isse ho jaataa he
 European scholars believe that twelve parts or twelve zodiac signs of the constellation cycle came from outside India
 kintu hamaare vaidic sahitya main surya kii gati ke aadhaar par nakshatra chakra ke baarah bhaag or chandramaa kii dainik gati ke aadhaar par 27 bhaag pehle se kiye gaye hai
 Although the stories related to the constellations and the moon are in our Puranas, there are no stories of the Meshadi zodiacs but in the Greek literature
 phir bhi itane se hi siddh nahin hota ki rashigananaa or bhav bharat main baahar se aae
 The statements of European scholars are giving evidence to the contrary
 jaikobi kaa kathan he ki janmkundali main dwadash grihon se fal bataane kii paddati formikas matternas ke granth main milti he
 It is also known here that no Jataka texts are known in Greece even before Ptolemy
 tolemi ke do jataka granth almijasti or titrabiblas kahe jate hai kintu yah pramanit nahin he
 It is not possible to have 6 Aryan writers and five Arasha writers in the pre-250 years of Varahamihira, if the preaching of the book of Parmicus Maternus was accepted as true in India after 354 AD
 varahamihir ne apane purvavarti may yavan, manittth, satya, vishnugupt aadi aacharyon kaa naam liya he
 Bhattottapal, the commentator of Brihajatak, holds that he is Acharya Chanakya, the minister of Vishnugupta Moon
 is prakaar yah hamaari rashigananaa paddati isvi san se 300 varsh purv kii siddh hoti he
 This does not make the statement that the census came from outside India
 brihatsamhita ke grahacharadhyay main grahagochar fal die hai
 Chandra is the first place in it
 us adhyay main 'mandavy' kaa ullekh he
 Mandavya is a great writer
 mandavy ke granth main chandrakundali mukhya thi athwa usamen chandramaa ke sthaan se vichaar kiya gaya tha
 This idea was from 9 places of Atharva Jyatish
 10 raashiyon ke prachaar main aane ke baad iskaa vichaar 12 bhaavon se hone laga
 Therefore, it is only reasonable to assume that the method of horoscope was practiced by a sage like Garga etc
 kyonki isvi san se 500 varsh purv vidyaman vishisht siddhant main bhi lagn or bhaavon kii kalpana he
 Some zodiac signs and Greek names in Indian astrology are proof that we had ancient contact with the Greeks
 unase anek vidyaon or kalaon kaa aadan-pradaan bhi hua
 Varahamihira has written that- isse yah nishkarsh nahin nikaalnaa chahie ki hamaara sara kaa sara jatakashastra udhaar liya gaya he
 Knowing the method of Indian horoscope, the Greeks expanded it and presented it in a new form to the Indians in the time of Varahamihira
 falat: varahamihir ne unki hora, dreshkan aadi naveen paddatiyon ke saath raashiyon ke naam bhi unani hi rakh liye, jaise aaj hamaara bijganit arabon dwaara europe main failaayaa jaakar apane bahad rup main pun: bharat lautakar naveen ganit ke naam se vikhyath hua he
 Just as there are twelve zodiac signs in the sky, in the present time there are twelve expressions in the horoscope
 janm kundali yaa janmang chakra main kisi ke janm samay main akaash kii us janm sthaan par kya sthiti thi, iskaa akashi naksh he
 The chart of the twelve mines is made in Janmang

 Ancient Egyptian History is lekh main pracheen misr ke sabhi farogan kii suchi he
 This was the early Egyptian dynasty period, around 3000 BC
 Was from the Ptolemaic dynasty, until Egypt 30 BC
 In August, it became a province of ancient Rome under Caesar
 is suchi kaa paath abhi apurna he: Very old times include the Early Dynasty period, when there were two separate kingdoms over Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt - the First and Second Dynasties
 nichalaa misr, jise kaali bhoomi bhi kaha jaataa tha, uttari nil or ] nadimukh-bhoomi
 The list below is not complete: Upper Egypt, known as the Red Land, consisted of the southern Nile and the deserts
 The following list may not be complete : The First Dynasty judged from c
3050 BC to 2890 BC
 The Second Dynasty ruled from 2890 to2686 BC
 The Old Kingdom is the period in the third millennium BC when Egypt attained its first continuous peak of civilisational complexity and achievement, spanning the period when Egypt was judged by the Third Dynasty through the Sixth Dynasty
 Many Egyptologists also include the Memphite Seventh and Eighth Dynasties in the Old Kingdom as a continuation of the administration centralized at Memphis
 The Old Kingdom was followed by a period of disunity and relative cultural decline referred to by Egyptologists as the First Intermediate Period - or, as the Egyptians called it, the "first illness
" The royal capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom was located at Memphis, where Djoser established his court
 The Old Kingdom is perhaps best known, however, for the large number of pyramids which were constructed at this time as pharaonic burial places
 For this reason, the Old Kingdom is frequently referred to as "the Age of the Pyramids"
 The Third Dynasty judged from 2686 to 2613 BC
 The Fourth Dynasty ruled from 2613 to 2498 BC and included the pharaohs who had the Great Pyramids built, Khufu, Khafra and Menkaura 
 The Fifth Dynasty judged from 2498 to 2345 BC
 The Sixth Dynasty ruled from 2345 to 2181 BC
 The First Intermediate Period is the period between the end of the Old Kingdom and the advent of the Middle Kingdom
 The Old Kingdom rapidly collapsed after the death of Pepi II
 He had reigned for 94 years, longer than any monarch in history, and died aged 100
 The latter years of his reign were marked by inefficiency because of his advanced age
 The Union of the Two Kingdoms fell apart and regional leaders had to cope with the resulting famine
 Around 2160 BC, a new line of pharaohs tried to reunite Lower Egypt from their capital in Herakleopolis Magna
 In the meantime, however, a rival line based at Thebes was reuniting Upper Egypt and a clash between the two rival dynasties was inevitable
 Around 2055 BC, a descendant of the pharaoh Intef III defeated the Herakleopolitan pharaohs, reunited the Two Lands, founded the Eleventh Dynasty and ruled as Mentuhotep II, the first pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom
 The Seventh and Eighth Dynasties ruled from 2181 to 2160 BC
 The Ninth Dynasty judged from 2160 to 2130 BC
 The Tenth Dynasty was a local group that held sway over Lower Egypt that ruled from 2130 to 2040 BC
 The Eleventh Dynasty was a local group with roots in Upper Egypt that ruled from 2134 to 1991 B
C
 The Middle Kingdom is the period from the end of the First Intermediate Period to the beginning of the Second Intermediate Period
 In addition to the Twelfth Dynasty, some scholars include the Eleventh, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Dynasties in the Middle Kingdom
 The Middle Kingdom can be noted for the expansion of trade outside of the kingdom that occurred during this time
 This opening of trade eventually led to the downfall of the Middle Kingdom, induced by an invasion from the Hyksos
 The second part of the Eleventh Dynasty is considered to be part of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt
 The Twelfth Dynasty ruled from 1991 to 1802 BC, and is considered by later Egyptians to have been their greatest dynasty
 The Second Intermediate Period is a period of disarray between the end of the Middle Kingdom, and the start of the New Kingdom
 It is best known as when the Hyksos made their appearance in Egypt, whose reign comprised the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Dynasties
 The Thirteenth Dynasty was much weaker than the Twelfth Dynasty, and was unable to hold onto the long land of Egypt
 The provincial ruling family in Xois, located in the marshes of the western Delta, broke away from the central authority to form the Fourteenth Dynasty
 The Hyksos made their first appearance during the reign of Sobekhotep IV, and around 1720 BC took control of the town of Avaris
 The Hyksos, led by Salitis, the founder of the Fifteenth Dynasty, overran Egypt during the reign of Dudimose I
 Around the time Memphis fell to the Hyksos, the native Egyptian ruling house in Thebes declared its independence and set itself up as the Seventeenth Dynasty
 This dynasty eventually drove the Hyksos back into Asia The Thirteenth Dynasty judged from 1803 to around 1649 BC and lasted 153 or 154 Yrs according to Manetho
 This table should be contrasted with Known kings of the 13th Dynasty The position of the following kings is uncertain: The Fourteenth Dynasty was a local group from the Eastern Delta, based at Xois, that ruled from around 1705 to around 1690 BC
 The position of the following kings is uncertain: The Turin King List provides an additional 25 names, some fragmentary, and no dates
 None are attested to elsewhere, and all are of very dubious provenance
 The Fifteenth Dynasty arose from among the Hyksos people: desert Bedouins who emerged out of the Fertile Crescent to establish a short-lived governance over much of the Nile region, and ruled from 1674 to 1535 BC
 The Sixteenth Dynasty was a local native kingdom from Thebes who ruled Egypt for between 80 and 100 years, according to Kim Ryholt
 Some sources include as many as six more names – The Seventeenth Dynasty was based in Upper Egypt and ruled from 1650 to 1550 BC: The New Kingdom is the period covering the Eighteenth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth dynasty of Egypt, from the 16th century BC to the 11th century BC, between the Second Intermediate Period, and the Third Intermediate Period
 Through military dominance abroad, the New Kingdom saw Egypt's greatest territorial extent
 It expanded far into Nubia in the south, and held wide territories in the Near East
 Egyptian armies fought with Hittite armies for control of modern-day Syria
 Two of the best known pharaohs of the New Kingdom are Akhenaten, also known as Amenhotep IV, whose exclusive worship of the Aten is often interpreted as the first instance of monotheism, and Ramesses II, who attempted to recover the territories in modern Israel / Palestine, Lebanon and Syria that had been held in the Eighteenth Dynasty
 His reconquest led to the Battle of Qadesh, where he led the Egyptian armies against the army of the Hittite king Muwatalli II
 The Eighteenth Dynasty judged from 1550 to 1295 BC: The Nineteenth Dynasty ruled from 1292 to 1186 BC and includes one of the greatest pharaohs: rameces dwitiya the Great: The Twentieth Dynasty judged from 1185 to 1069 BC: The Third Intermediate Period marked the end of the New Kingdom after the collapse of the Egyptian empire
 a number of dynasties of Libyan origin ruled, giving this period its alternative name of the Libyan Period
 The Twenty-first Dynasty was based at Tanis and was a relatively weak group
 Theoretically, they were rulers of all Egypt, but in practice their influence was limited to Lower Egypt
 They ruled from 1069 to 945 BC The pharaohs of the Twenty-second Dynasty were Libyans, ruling from around 945 to 720 BC: The Twenty-third Dynasty was a local group, again of Libyan origin, based at Herakleopolis and Thebes that ruled from 836 to c
735 BC: Not reckoned a dynasty as such, the Libu were yet another group of western nomads who occupied the western Delta from 805 to 732 BC
 The Twenty-fourth Dynasty was a short-lived rival dynasty located in the western Delta, with only two Pharaoh ruling from 732 to 720 BC
 The Late Period runs from 732 BC to Egypt becoming a province of Rome in 30 BC, and includes periods of rule by Nubians, Persians, and Macedonians
 Nubians invaded Egypt in 732 BC and took the throne of Egypt, considering the Twenty-fifth Dynasty which ruled until 656 BC
 They were ultimately driven back into Nubia, where they established a kingdom at Napata, and, later, at Meroë 
 The Twenty-sixth Dynasty judged from around 672 to 525 BC
 Egypt was conquered by the Persian Empire in 525 BC and annexed by the Persians until 404 BC
 The Achaemenid shahs were acknowledged as pharaohs in this era, forming a "twenty-seventh" Dynasty: The Twenty-eighth Dynasty lasted only 6 years, from 404 to 398 BC, with one Pharaoh: The Twenty-ninth Dynasty ruled from 398 to 380 BC: The Thirtieth Dynasty judged from 380 until Egypt once more came under Persian rule in 343 BC: Egypt again came under the control of the Achaemenid Persians
 After the practice of Manetho, the Persian rulers from 343 to 332 BC are occasionally designated as the Thirty-first Dynasty: The Macedonians under Alexander the Great ushered in the Hellenistic period with his conquest of Persia and Egypt
 The Argeads ruled from 332 to 309 BC: The second Hellenistic dynasty, the Ptolemies ruled Egypt from 305 BC until Egypt became a province of Rome in 30 BC : Cleopatra VII had an affair with Roman Dictator Julius Caesar, and Roman General Marc Antony, but it was not until her suicide in 30 BC that Egypt became a province of Rome in 30 BC
 Subsequent Roman Emperors were accorded the title of Pharaoh, although exclusively while in Egypt
 One Egyptian king-list lists the Roman Emperors as Pharaohs up to and including Decius
 See the list of Roman emperors

 Human resource management is the skillful and consistent approach to managing the most valuable assets of an establishment - those working there and contributing to the achievement of business objectives individually and collectively

 The theoretical discipline is primarily based on the assumption that employees are individuals who have different goals and needs and should not be thought of as basic business resources such as trucks and filing cabinets
 is kshetra main karmchaariyon ke prati ek sakaaratmak drushtikon apanaaya jaataa he, yah maanate hue ki lagbhag sabhi karmchaaree udhyam main utpaadakta ke yogadan kii ichha rakhte hai or unke prayaason main mukhya baadha gyaan kaa abhaav, aparyaapt prashikshan or prakriya kii vifaltaaen hai
 Novice professionals working in the human resource management field are seen as a more innovative approach than the traditional approach to management
 isaki takneekein ek udhyam ke prabandhakon ko apane lakshyon ko vishistataa ke saath is prakaar vyakt karne ke liye baadhya karti hai
 It should be done in such a way that it can be understood and adopted by the employees and provide them the necessary resources for the successful execution of the assigned tasks

 So if we talk about the actual definition, according to Torrington and Hall, the definition of personnel management is as follows: "aisi gatividhiyon kii ek shrinkhalaa jo: prathamtah kaam karne waalon or unke niyokta pratishthanon ke uddeshyon or kaary-sambandh kii prakruti tathaa dwitiyatah yah sunishchit karnaa ki samjhaute kaa puraa nirvaah hua he

 In addition, the HR establishment also has trouble proving how the company benefits from their activities and processes
 keval haal ke varshon main hi HR vidwaanon or HR peshewaron ne vah model viksit karne par dhyaan kendrit kiya he jo yah nirdhaarit kar saktaa he ki HR se phayda hota he
 Human resource management is involved in many processes
 saath hi unase uparyukt lakshya ko praapt karne kii apeksha kii jaati he
 These processes can be implemented by an HR department, but some tasks can also be done outsourced or by line-managers or other departments

 These policies often remain in the form of employee manuals that all employees have
 yah dhyaan dene yogya he ki kuch log HRM or HRD ke bich antar dekhte hai
 Such people include HRM in HRD, saying that HRD includes a wide range of activities within the establishment, such as career development, training, development of the establishment, etc

 More recently, establishments have considered the key role of an "HR department" that helps employees in hiring, training and managing people to enable the organization to perform tasks with maximum efficiency in a high way
 kisi upkram ke lakshyon ko praapt karne tathaa uske kaary ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye upyukt evam yogya karmchaariyon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Such employees can be obtained only if they are selected scientifically

 In large industries where many tasks are done, the requirement of the employees should be prepared by the supervisor according to the department, because he is well aware of the production capacity of the employees, and is able to determine the required labor accordingly

 The desired number of labor should be clear and sure
 is prakaar vibhinn kaaryon ke liye pruthak-pruthak maang patr taiyaar kiye jate hai
 The problem of recruitment of workers was not complicated when the industries were not much developed

 It is necessary that secular management should be in close contact with these sources

 san 1955 main bhartiya sansad ne sarkari pratishthanon main bhartee hetu ek audyogic seva ayog ke bare main sukshav diya tha ki jisase kaary-pranali main adhik dakshata laayi ja sake
 The question of running these establishments more efficiently was also considered by the Estimates Committee
 sarkari pratishthanon main vibhinn padon ke liye alag-alag pranaaliyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The manager obtains the list from national registers and planning offices for the recruitment of technical staff and gets the advertisement published in newspapers
 kai baar kendriya athwa rajya sarkaar tathaa nijee pratishthanon se bhi upyukt vyakti sujhane hetu aagrah kiya jaataa he
 For these posts, the candidates have to take a written examination or interview
 saarvajanik upakramon main bhartee / niyojan hetu nimna nitiyaan sujhai gayi hai : - The selection process consists of the following steps: yadi chayan-prakriya ke antargat abhyarthiyon ko kaam karne par bal dena he to praarambhik saakshaatkaar kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Such an interview will be very brief and its main purpose is to find out the obvious defects and ineligibility of the candidates and cancel them
 bolte samay haklaana, chalate samay langadaana, haath yaa pair kaa tutaa hona, aankhon main dosha hona aadi dosha kaa pataa lagane ke liye kisi visheshgy kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 Secondly, in this type of interview, information is obtained about the salary, educational qualification and experience required by the candidates
 keval unheen abhyarthiyon ko chayan ke prakriya main aage badhane kaa avasar pradaan kiya janaa chahie jinke chayan kii kuch sambhaavnaayen hon
 Some big companies print different types of applications for different categories of posts, such as by the applicant in different types of applications for vacancies in purchasing department, sales department, factory department, office etc
 In different types of application forms to be filled, the space for the following information to be filled by the applicant remains vacant- aavedan-patr praapt karne ke baad unki jaanch kii jaati he jin abhyarthiyon main nunatam apekshit yogyata se kam yogyata ho unhen asweekaar kar diya jaataa he
 Psychological testing is a systematic program that compares the behavior of two or more individuals
 bloom ke matanusaar manovaigyanik pareekshan vyakti ke vyavhaar nishpaadan evam abhiruchi ke paksh kaa ek namoona he
 It is a methodical program through which a sample of an individual's behavior is obtained
 saakshaatkaar se pehle kabhi-kabhi vyavsaayik parikshaayen lenaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 So that the technical and theoretical capacity of the applicants can be estimated
 pramukh pareekshan ye hai- All these exams can be categorized as 'mental exams'
 maansik parikshaayen le lene ke baad karmchaariyon kii vyavsaayik parikshaayen lee jaani chahie
 The most widely used tool in any selection process is 'interview'
 bina iske chayan prakriya ko purna nahin samajha jaataa he
 The higher the post in the management chain, the importance of interview in the selection process also increases according to the gravity of the post
 saakshaatkaar kaa arth vaartalap athwa unase paraspar moulik kriya se he jo saamanytah do vyaktiyon ke bich kisi vishesh uddeshy se kii jaati he
 Through this, an attempt is made to get information about the person's shape, behavioral skills, emotional stability, nature, motivation and interest etc
 ’’ The objectives of the interview are three: - saakshaatkaar kaa praathmik uddeshy kaary ke liye praarthi kii or praarthi ke liye kaary kii upyuktata kaa pataa lagaana he
 Interviewing is an art and successful interviews follow some established or valid principles for comparison between a person's abilities and work requirements
 saakshaatkaar ke pramukh baaten ye hai- The main purpose of this type of interview is to do preliminary screening or retrenchment of the applicants
 is vidhi se ayogy abhyarthiyon kaa nirasan karne kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he jisase ki shesh aavedan-patron kii jaanch gaharaai se kii ja sake evam saakshaatkaar ke samay anaavashyak samay nasht na ho
 This type of interview is completed in more than five minutes
 isamen adhik kushal saakshatkaariyon kii aavashyaktaa nahi hoti
 The drawback of this method is that sometimes qualified applicants are canceled because this interview is done in a hurry and the interviewees are not very skilled
 yadi uddeshy spasht rup se ayogy aavedankartao kii chantni kerani hi he, to acha yah hoga ki praarambhik saakshaatkaar ke sthaan par sabase pehle to aavedan-patron kii jaanch kii jaye or phir yadi aavashyak he ki unki ek sankshipt-likhit pariksha le lee jaay 
 This should be done in the same condition when the number of applicants is much higher than the available work
 ‘‘is prakaar ke anveshan main saamanytah nimna baton ke sambandh main jaankaree praapt kii jaati he- The next step in the selection process is to send the applicant to the doctor of the institution for detailed physical examination
 is pariksha kaa uddesh ya vyakti ke un shaareerik gunon ko prakat karnaa he jo ki vichaaradhin krity ke kushal nishpaadan kii drushti se mahatvapurn hote hai
 In this case, it will be possible to put the applicant on an inquiry which he can do well and get promotions in future
 saakshaatkaar evam pareekshanon ke aadhaar par praarthi kii niyukti karne athwa na karne ke vishay main nirnay liya jaataa he
 But before giving appointment letter, it is checked with the help of references provided by him
 chayankarta sandarbh ke jitne adhik nikat pahunchakar praarthi ke vishay main jaankaree praapt karegaa, jaankaree kii pramanikta evam vishwasaneeyata utani hi adhik hogi
 In case of receiving favorable reference, the applicant may be given a letter of appointment
 chayan prakriya dwaara jab praarthi kaa antim rup se chayan kar liya jaataa he or use niyukti-patr bhi de diya jaataa he, to aagaamee charan aata he ‘‘kaary par niyukti’’
 Applying any employee to the right act is as important as choosing it
 karmchaaree kii yathavidhi kaary par niyukti hone se karmchaaree kaa nishpaadan badhata he evam anupasthiti, durghatana dasha aadi main kami aati he
 Not only this, the morale and work capacity of the employee increases
 ‘ry par niyukti se aashay he chayan kiye gayi praarthi ko saunpe jane vaale krity kaa nirdhaaran tathaa us krity kaa praarthi ko saunpna
 After selection, the applicant is usually appointed on probation for six months or one year
 is avadhi santoshprad kaary nishpaadan kii dasha main niyukti ko sthaayee kar diya jaataa he
 If the work is not satisfactory during this period, the employee can also be removed from work
 ’’ After appointment on the job, the newly appointed employee is required to come or introduce him to the establishment, work and colleagues
 parichay vah kriya he jiske madhyam se nav-niyukti karmchaaree ko rojgaar pradaan karne vaale sanghathan ke vishay main vistrut jaankaree di jaati he
 The following topics are usually provided to the employee through 'introductory Program' iske uparant samay samay par yah dekhte rahanaa bhi aavashyak he ki jis uddeshy se karmchaaree kii niyukti kii gai thi vah puraa ho rahaa he athwa nahin
 It is called "advent" in the language of management
 ’’ Workers in the industry did not like to work more from the early stage of the 20th century until attaining independence because they were more interested in rural life
 gaanv chhodana shramikon ko pasand nahin tha
 However, the situation changed with the increase in the burden of population on agriculture and the development of industrialization
 gramin kshetron main kaam kii kami hone lagi tathaa udyogon kii ore shramikon ko aakarshith karne ke liye madhyasthon kaa sahaara lenaa padaa
 In both organized and unorganized industries , the method of recruitment by intermediaries is still prevalent today
 in madhyasthon ko desh ke vibhinn bhaagon main alag-alag naamon se pukaara jaataa he, jaise- jaanbar, sardaar choudhary, mukaddam, forman, mistre, kangaani aadi
 In large factories, there are women examinations which are called Naikin or Mukdamin
 shramikon ko niyukt karnaa, nikaalnaa va rakhaana padonnati karnaa, chuttee dilaanaa, aadi inhi madhyasthon kaa kaam hota he
 The Wwaitley Commission has also written that employees were appointed from nearby villages
 keval kushal shramikon ko hi baahar se praapt kiya jaataa tha
 But after independence, there were many changes in the system of recruitment of workers
 shramikon kii pravasi pravriti main badlaav aayaa he tathaa unki gatishiltaa bhi badi he
 They now prefer to live in cities than in villages
 iske atirikt shram ke shahi kamishan, shram anusandhan samiti, bambai taxtile lebar jaanch samiti, aadi ne paramparaagat dooshit bharti paddatiyon ko samaapt karne kii anushansa kii tathaa vaigyanik paddatiyon ke prachlan par adhik bal diya he
 As a result, in India, many new sources of recruitment are used to obtain qualified employees in both private and social sectors
 rashtiy shram ayog ne saarvajanik kshetra ke udyogon kii shram samasyaon ke adhyayan ke dauraan apane prativedan main sarvocch adhikariyon se lekar nimnasth karmchaariyon tak kii niyukti ke vishay main vartmaan paristhiti par prakaash daalaa he
 According to the commission, a panel is prepared to appoint high officials

 Names are recommended with the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet from this panel

 Priority of local applicants is given for appointment of desired staff at functional levels

 pro0 rudrabasavraj ke adhyayan se yah bhi vidit hota he ki saarvajanik kshetra main bhartee ke jin sroton kaa upyog kiya gaya unki praathamikta kaa kram niyamanusaar hai- From the above study, information about the means of recruitment used in the public sector as well as the private sector has been obtained
 vah is prakaar hai- While forecasting the manpower requirements by the small and big industries of the private sector, the demand for labor, technical changes, government policies, etc
 are taken into consideration
 It is true that the systems used by most organizations are unproven
 keval tata, bidla, daalamia, baghad, di0si0em0 aadi jaise bade-bade sanghathanon main purnataya vaigyanik evam vivekpurna chayan paddatiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Manpower is planned by these organizations, budget is prepared, full contact with recruitment sources is made, and employees are selected by standardized selection methods

 Education and preservation are the basic mantra of a good management system
 yadi karmchaariyon se kaary or adhik utpaadan, praapt karnaa chaahate he to anke dwaara banaayi gai vastuon kii kism acchhee rakhana he to shiksha evam prashikshan atyant aavashyak he
 Through this, the employee not only acquires knowledge about the work but also generates interest in the work
 prashikshan kisi karmchaaree ko kisi vishisht kaary ko karne yogya banane kii prakriya he jiske madhyam se vyakti kii yogyata, kaaryakshmata tathaa nipunata main vruddhi kii jaati he
 There is a difference between education and training
 shiksha kaa sambandh sampoorn vaataavaran evam paristhitiyon ke gyaan evam jaankaree se hota he
 Thus, education is aimed at the general development of the individual, whereas training is intentional education which aims at the attainment of a specific type of knowledge
 It is also true that it is difficult to move towards specific training without general education
 shiksha yathochit bodh kaa saamaanya aadhaar or prashikshan karyanvayan kaa vishisht kaushal mana ja saktaa he jo donon hi karmchaaree kii yogyata, kaaryakshmata evam nipunata ke liye aavashyak he ‘‘vastav main shiksha evam prashikshan kii aavashyaktaa ke teen mukhya aadhaar he- Through training, employee dissatisfaction can be overcome, absenteeism rate can be reduced, personal development of employees can be done in the right direction
 tathaa sanghathanaatmak sthirataa evam loch sheeltaa main vrudvi hoti he
 "in favor of the need for education and training, the following components are worth remembering - vartmaan yug main kaarkaane main kaam karne vaale shramikon ke swasthya, suraksha evam kalyaan kii aavashyaktaa teevr rup se anubhav kii gai he
 By protecting the health of workers, their efficiency can be increased and more production can be expected from them

 In India, cow farming was practiced along with agriculture since time immemorial, the proof of which is Lord Krishna and Balarama in our texts, which we address as Gopal and Haldhar i

 vikaas kii drushti se bhashavaigyanikon ne bharat main aryabhasha ke teen str niyat kiye hai - pracheen, madhyakaalin or arvachin
 The languages of ancient level are Vedic Sanskrit and Sanskrit, whose development period is supposedly BC
 From 2000 BC Up to 600 are considered
 madhyayugin bhashaayen hai - magadhi, ardhamagadhi, shauraseni, pashachi bhashaa, maharashtri or apbhransh
 Their development is found as early as 600 AD to 1000 AD
 iske pashchaat, hindi, gujarati, marathi, banglaa, aadi uttar bharat kii aadhunik aryabhashaon kaa vikaas prarambh hua jo aaj tak chalaa aa rahaa he
 The following characteristics are found mainly in the said medieval languages from ancient languages: sanskrit ke swaron main ri, lri, evam i or ou kaa madhyayugin bhashaaon main abhaav he
 These languages have their own specialty using a and O's passive quantities
 visarg yahan sarvatha nahin paaya jaataa
 Tangents from a to m are found
 kintu anunasikon main sankoch tathaa vyatyay hota he
 Only one and especially the residual is found in place of the three heat colors
 sanyukt vyanjanon kaa praaia abhaav he
 Both the conjunctive consonants are either equated or both are separated by Swaragam, or one of them is omitted
 dvitv vyanjan se purv kaa deergh swar hrasv kar diya jaataa he evam sanyukt vyanjan main se ek kaa lop kar usase purv kaa hrasv swar deergh kar diya jaataa he
 Grammatically, dialects are not found in the forms of nouns and verbs
 halant sangyaaon or dhaatuon ko swarant banaakar chalaaya jaataa he
 Hesitancy is found in forms of causation
 kriyaaon main ganabhed evam parasmapad aatmanepad kaa bhed nahin kiya jaataa
 All types of options go by option
 kriyaroopon main kaladi bhedon kaa alpikaran hua he
 Much of their work is often run with participles
 ab prashn yah hota he ki madhyayug kii bhashaaon main sanskrit kii apeksha itani adhik visheshtaayen kab, kyon, kaise or kahan par utpann ho gayi
 Varyukhi etc
 of Prakrit, assuming the nature of Prakrit languages as Sanskrit, derived the word Prakrit from it
 "prakruti: sanskritan, tatrabhavan tat aagtan vaa prakritam"
 But the present form of the Sanskrit language itself has developed around the pre-sixth century AD and its stable form was found by Panini
 The third is given in the fourth century
 sanskrit ke ukt prakaar ke anek lakshanon se vibhinn bhashaaon kaa chhathi shatee i
 pus
 main hi utpann hona kaise sambhav ho saktaa he ? iske atirikt praakrit main aise bhi anek shabd paae jate hai jinka sanskrit main abhaav he, kintu vaidic bhashaa main ve vidyaman hai
 Many of the words with many of Prakrit's tendencies are found in the Vedas, which are not compatible with Sanskrit grammar
 is samasya par anek paashchaatya vidwaanon kaa ek mat yah he ki aryabhasha jab bharatvarsh main prachlit hui, anarya log uskaa aaryo ke sadrush shuddh shuddh uccharan or prayog nahin kar paae; atev unhone apane nijee uccharan evam bhashastyli ke anusaar use bolnaa prarambh kiya or unke sampark se is kaa prabhaav aaryo par bhi padaa
 Due to this, the instincts of Prakrit language developed
 is mat ke samarthan main yah baat bhi dhyaan dene yogya he ki vaidic kaal se hi jo t th aadi murdhanya dhvaniyon kaa pravesh aryabhasha main hua, vah bahulata se us kaal kii anarya bhashaaon kaa hi prabhaav tha
 But by analyzing the ancient non-aryan languages, it cannot be proved that the seeds of the above characteristics of Prakrit were present in those non-aryan languages
 isiliye is mat ke sambandh main vivaad he
 The second view is that there were phonetic distinctions among the castes that spoke the language of the Vedas, some evidence of which is present in the Vedas itself
 Presumably, the language of the Vedas evolved from the hierarchy of the orthodox Vedas of that period, presumably in several thousand years
 But the specially educated priestly class had its own language, and in which it was used only in religious works
 utane hi kaal pracheenatam vaidic bhashaa kii samakaleen jansadharan kii lokbhasha se sanskrit ke saath saath hi praakrit kaa bhi vikaas hua, jisamen pradeshbhedanusaar naanaa bhed the
 It is also worth noting in this regard that the entry of Aryans in India cannot be said to have taken place at the same time and in one stream
 yadi aage peeche aanevaali arya jatiyon ke bhashabhed se praakrit bhashaaon ke udgam or vikaas va sambandh ho to aashcharya nahin
 In this connection, the opinion of Hornley and Grierson is also notable according to which the Indian Aryan languages are found divided into two classes, one external and the other two in the north, west, south and east languages
 ise sankshep main samajhane ke liye maharashtra pradesh ke naamon jaise gokhale, kher, paranjape, padhye, munje godwole, tambe, tathaa lanka main prachlit naamon jaise gunatilake sena naike, bandarnayak aadi main jo acarant karta ek vachan ke rup se e pratyay dikhaai detaa he, vahi purv kii magadhi praakrit me apane niyamit sthirataa ko praapt hua paaya jaataa he
 In the Adi Aryabhasha, the pronunciation of l has been considered in place of Vedic, like Kulu u srotra
 usee pravriti ke falswaroop vaidic vrik ke sthaan par german bhashasmooh main vulf evam greek main pruthu kaa plutus paaya jaataa he
 These are replaced by the pronunciation of l in the place of sound, but their symmetrical forms like Otta atta, satta are also found in dialects of the same period
 bogaajakui ke bhinn mitanni aryashakha ke jo lagbhag 200 i
 pus
 ke lekh mili hai unamem indra or naasatya devataaon ke naam inder or nasaateey rup se ankit hai
 There is a tendency among them to combine combined characters by voice
 varun devtaa kaa naam "uruvan" rup main ullikhit he jisamen swar ke agragam tathaa varnavyatyay kii pravriti spasht dikhaai detii he
 These trends are common symptoms of Prakrit
 pali main prayukt idh sanskrit tathaa vaidic ke ih se purvakaleen parampara kaa he isamen bhi kisi ko koi andeh nahin he
 In the Arya language, the forms of a and o were Hrasva; Ai and Au were lacking; But mixed vowels like ai, au were prevalent; Resonant touches were hesitant; Of the three heats, there was only one
 ye dhvanyatmak visheshtaayen pradhanat: shauraseni praakrit main surakshit pai jaati hai, ityadi
 The harmony of these traits can be properly resolved by assuming that their arrival in the Prakrit languages has been carried on by dialects of the earliest Aryan castes, a tradition unconstrained
 yatharthat: sanskrit ho athwa vaidic ko hi praakrit kii prakruti maan lene se ukt lakshanon kaa koi samaadhaan nahin hota
 Then why did the grammar of Prakrit call Sanskrit the nature of Prakrit? The reason for this is clearly understood by paying attention to the time and form of the grammar of those grammars
 ve vyakaran us kaal main likhe gaye jab vidvatsamaj main praakrit kii apeksha sanskrit kaa adhik prachaar or sammaan tha
 They have also been written in Sanskrit language and they also had to aim for naturalism in Sanskrit plays and in which excellent literary works were also produced
 atev un vaiyakarnon ne sanskrit ko adarsh tehraakar usase jo visheshtaayen praakrit main thim unka vivaran upasthit kar diya or isaki sarthakata sanskrit ko praakrit kii prakruti kahkar siddh kar di
 However, Namisadhu has made his view clear that the meaning of nature is public or public and that people should be called Prakrit only after being a language
 prakruti kaa arth lok bahut pracheen he tathaa kalidas ne bhi uskaa lok ke arth main prayog kiya he 
 In the light of this very ancient tradition of Prakrit, the rationale of calling these languages late and medieval rather than Vedic and Sanskrit also becomes considerable
 uski yadi koi sarthakata he to keval itani ki ye bhashaayen vaidic or sanskrit ke pashchaat hi sahitya main prayukt huin
 They were used for the first time for religious propaganda
 Shramana Mahavir and Buddha did it in the sixth century
 tathaa unki saahitiyik rachanaaon main shabdon tathaa style kii drushti se sanskrit kaa bada prabhaav drushtigochar hota he
 As long as the language remains in the dialect, it changes constantly in comparison to the country and time
 isi niyam ke anusaar kaal ke saapeksh praakrit ke teen str sweekaar kiye gaye hai - The language or languages in which Shramana Mahavira and Buddha gave their teachings must have been excellent forms of ancient level of Prakrit
 unke upadeshon kii bhashaa ko kramash: magadhi evam ardhamagadhi kaha gaya he
 But we do not find the form of Magadhi in the texts of the language currently called Pali, as the later grammarians have told
 tathaapi bhashaa kaa jo swaroop buddha tripitak granthon main paaya jaataa he vah praakrit ke pracheen str kaa hi sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 The most authentic form of this level Prakrit is available in the scriptures engraved on the stones and pillars of Ashoka
 in shilaon kii sankhya lagbhag 30 he
 Fortunately, only the nature of the Prakrit language of the E
 East III century is safe, but in those commendations we also get the regional differences of the then language
 pashchimottar pradesh main shahbajgadhi or mansehara naamak sthanon kii shilaon par jo 14 prashastiyaan khudi hui pai gai hai unamem sparsh varnon ke atirikt r or l evam sh sh s ye teenon ooshm praaia: apane apane sthanon par surakshit hai
 Combined characters containing the type also appear
 kintu jna or nay ke sthaan par na kaa prayog paaya jaataa he
 Thus, this language can be said to be the vampiric nature of grammars
 ye hi 14 prashastiyaan us bhashaa ko shauraseni kaa pracheen rup prakat karti hai
 They are also engraved with 14 testimonials at places known as Uttar Kalsi, Jaugad Nachhauli
 inamen hamen r ke sthaan par l tathaa acarant sangyaaon ke karta kaarak ek vachan kii e vibhakti praapt hoti he
 However, instead of three heaters, there is no existence of milk
 is prakaar yahan magadhi praakrit ke teen lakshan nahin
 Therefore, it receives two of the three symptoms of half-life Prakrit more abundantly than Magadhi, but not the third sign of affection
 atev ise magadhi kii apeksha ardhamagadhi praakrit kaa pracheen rup kahana adhik upyukt prathit hota he
 Ashoka's commendations are important in literary terms in addition to his philological significance
 unamem pracheen bharat ke ek aise samraat ke niti, dharm evam sadachaar sambandhi vichaar or upadesh nihit hai jisane na keval is vishaal desh ke samast bhaagon par raajnneetik adhikaar hi praapt kiya tha, tathaa desh ke baahar bhi alexandria tak bhinn bhinn deshon se saanskrithik sambandh sthapit kiya tha or yahan apane dharmadoot bhi bheje the
 Outside of all this, even to Alexandria, cultural relations were established with different countries and sent their apostles there
 in sab drushtiyon se yah sahitya apane dhang kaa adwitiya he
 Another example of ancient level Prakrit is the article of Kalingasamrat Kharavel engraved in the cavity named Hathigumpha of Udayagiri Khandagiri in Orissa which resembles Ashoka's inscriptions in many respects
 kintu isaki apni visheshta yah he ki isamen us samrat ke varsho kii vijayon tathaa lokkalyaan sambandhi kaaryo kaa vivaran likhaa gaya he
 Its period is supposedly BC Second century
 uski bhashaa ashok kii girnaar kii prashastiyon se mail khaati he, atev vah pracheen shauraseni kahi ja sakati he
 BC of this nature It is found in the third century in western India and its hundred, one and a half hundred years later Jain texts like Jain Shatkhandagam and Kundakundacharya etc
 in the compositions of South Pradesh are proof of its erstwhile divinity and universality
 us kaal main itnaa prachaar or kisi bhashaa kaa nahin paaya jaataa
 We find use of this ancient level of Prakrit in the available segments of plays like Sarvaputra episode, Ashwaghosh
 inamen nayakon tathaa ek do anya paatro ko chhodkar shesh sabhi paatr praakrit bolte hai, jiske teen rup spasht dikhaai dete hai
 In the Sariputra episode, in the language of the wicked, instead of,, श् in place of the three thermals, and विभ inflection as the nominative singular of the non-term nouns, these three signs clearly prove that part to be Magadhi
 yahan k t aadi aghosh varna na to g d aadi saghoshon main parivartit hue milte, na tha gh aadi mahapraan varna h main parivartit hue milte, na th gh aadi mahapraan varna hri main parivartit hue or na dantya n ke sthaan par murdhanya na dikhaai detaa
 These signs of Prakrit of Ashwaghosh are proving him of ancient status
 gorv naamak paatr kii bhashaa kii praakrit main r ke sthaan par s kaa prayog hua he
 These symptoms are proving him half-dead
 nayika, vidooshak tathaa anya paatro kii praakrit main r or l apane apane sthanon par hai
 All are found in the form of heat, and the nominative singular form is found
 inase yah bhashaa spashtat: pracheen shauraseni kahi ja sakati he
 After this, a detailed description of the distinctions of Prakrit languages is found in Bharata Natyashastra
 unhone vaani kaa paath do prakaar kaa mana he- sanskrit or praakrit; tathaa kaha he ki praakrit main teen prakaar ke shabd prachlit hai- samaan, vibhrasht or deshi
 He has given the description of linguistics in the play in this way - the best characters should speak Sanskrit, but if they become poor then speak Prakrit; Shramana, ascetic monk, woman, child, etc
 are impure
 tathaapi itnaa spasht he ki unhone k, t, da, ya or va ke lop, kha, gha aadi mahapraan varno ke sthaan par ha kaa aadesh; t kaa da, anadi t kaa aspasht da car uccharan; sht, shna aadi kaa khakaar, in parivartanon kaa ullekh kiya he
 It is evident from this that they are describing only the second level of Prakrit
 32wein adhyay main unhone dhruva naamak geetikavy kaa vistaar se udaahranon sahit varnan kiya he or spasht kaha he ki dhruva main shauraseni kaa hi prayog kiya janaa chahie 
 This is also proved by his examples
 at: pashchaatkaaleen dharna nirmul he ki naatakon ke gey bhaag main maharashtri kaa prayog kiya jaay
 Shaharaseni language should be used in drama by the opinion of Bharat or any country language as desired
 aisi deshbhashaayen saat hai - magadhi, aavanti, shauraseni, ardhamagadhi, vahlika or dakshinatya
 Magadhi for inner residents; Arghamagadhi for Chet, Rajputra and Seths; Oriya for Vidushkadi; Half-wagon for heroines and friends; Oriya for Vidushkadi; Avantha Avantha from Shaurseni for heroines and friends; Dakshinatya for warriors, civilians and gamblers; And use the Wahlika for castes, khas, shabar, shaka etc
 inke atirikt bharat ne shabar, aabhir, chandal aadi kii hin bhashaaon ko vibhasha kaha he
 In this way, the natural feelings that have been distributed among the characters of Bharata drama are partially followed in Sanskrit plays
 sanskrit naatakon main sabase adhik praakrit kaa upyog or vaichitrya shudrak krit mrichhakaticam main miltaa he
 According to Pishal, Keith scholars, etc
, the purpose of the creation of Mruthaktik seems to be to exemplify the rules of Natya Shastra related to Prakrit
 is naatak ke tikaakar prithvidhar ke matanusaar naatak main chaar prakaar kii praakrit kaa hi prayog kiya jaataa he - shauraseni, avantika, praachya or magadhi
 In the play presented, 11 characters such as Sutradhar, Nati, heroine Vasantasena, Brahmin woman and superior of Charudatta and their hostess are spoken by Shaurseni
 aavanti bhashaa bolanewaale keval do apradhan paatr hai
 The jester only speaks the oriental language; Then a total of six characters, the sons of Kunj, Chetak, Monk and Charudatta, speak Magadhi, in addition to this there are two characters each of Shakari, Chandali and Dhaki
 kintu yadi in sab paatro kii bhashaa kaa vishleshan kiya jaae to ve sab keval do bhaagon main baanti ja sakati hai - shauraseni or magaghi
 The commentator himself has said that in Avanti, only Rakar and the proverbs have a multiplicity and in Oriya the selfishness of Kakar
 anya baton main ve shauraseni hi hai
 Shakari, Chandali and Dhaki are all styles of Magadhi
 is prakaar naamchaar kaa praakrit bahulya hone par bhi vastut: mrichctic main ashwaghosh ke naatakon kii apeksha koi adhik bhashabhed nahin dikhaai detaa
 The nature of Prakrit has evolved from time to time and it has got some symptoms due to which this Prakrit is said to be second level than the ancient level
 isi str kii praakrit tathaa uske deshbhedon kaa vivaran hamen uplabdh praakrit vyakaranon main miltaa he or unheen kaa vipul sahitya bhi vidyaman he
 The primary language of the second level of Prakrit is the Chandrakrit Prakrit Grammar or Aashr Prakrit Grammar
 yah ati sankshipt he or keval 99 sutron main praakrit kii vidhiyon kaa nirupan kar diya gaya he
 The formulas that characterize this level are worth noting
 sutara 76 ke anusaar virgo ke pratham k ch t t aadi varnon ke sthaan par tritiy kaa aadesh hota he, jaise, pishachi -- bissaji, jataa -- data, kruthan -- kadan, pratisiddh -- padisiddhan
 According to sutra 77, the order of hakara in the place of kh & g such as mukh - muhan, megh: - neho, madhava: - mahvo, taurus: - vasho
 sutara 97 ke anusaar k tathaa virgon ke tritiy varno kaa swar ke pare lop hota he, jaise - kokil: -- kohli, bhaugik: -- bhoio, raja -- raaya, nadi -- nai
 According to Sutra 98, when there is no beyond the missing consonant, it is like, kakau kayau, nanau naya, rajau raya
 antim 99wein sutara main kaha gaya he ki praakrit kii shesh vyavastha shisht prayogon se janani chahie
 In the four sutras ahead of them, the signs of apomorphy, the absence of the joint letter, the order of l and n in place of Peshachi, the order of l and sh in place of guide, and the order of l and sh in place of st, The command of d is stated by the option in place of t
 bhashashastriyon kaa mat he ki dwitiya str ke aadi me k aadi abodh varnon ke sthaan par g aadi saghosh varno kaa uccharan hone laga
 Then their lower sound was left and then completely omitted, and instead of mahaprana sounds only a pure warm sound was left
 ye pravritiyaan tathaa ukt aarsh vyakaran main nirdisht ya shruti vikalp se samast jain praakrit he
 But based on the misconceptions that the Prakrit grammars of the later 16th, 17th centuries have produced in the representation of Prakrit, some Western scholars considered it necessary to specify the Prakrit of Jain literature separately by the names of Jaina Shaurseni and Jain Maharashtri due to the harmony of the above options
 , It is not historically real
 is aarsh praakrit vyakaran ke pashchaat prakritprakash naamak vyakaran likhaa gaya, jisamen aage do baar vruddhi kii gai
 The nine passages of Adi are varruced
 iname adarsh praakrit kii kramash: swarvidhi, vyanjanvidhi, sanyuktavarna vidhi, sankeern, sangyaroop, sarvnaam vidhi, kriyaaroop, dhatvadesh evam avyayon kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 Finally it is said that the remaining form of Prakrit should be understood by Sanskrit
 is vyakaran main dwitiya str ke praakrit kaa swaroop purnroop se nirdhaarit hua paaya jaataa he
 According to it, the intermediate is often omitted by the word d and d, and the command in place of the word and language
 prakritprakash ke is pracheen vibhaag par katyayan, bhamah, vasantraj, sadanand or rampanivadakrut tikaayen pai jaati hai
 In the 10th and 12th passages, the pasachi is represented in 14 sutras and the Magadhi in 17 sutras respectively
 in donon bhashaaon kii prakruti shauraseni kahi gai he
 But before that Shoureseni's name did not come anywhere
 atev anumaanath: iske kartaaon kii drushti main saamaanya praakrit kaa nirupan us kaal kii suprachlit shorseni kaa hi he
 These two passages have only Bhamah commentary and scholars estimate that these two passages are paired with them
 inamen pashachi kaa visheshta shabd ke madhya main tritiy chaturth varno ke sthaan par pratham tathaa dwitiya kaa aadesh, na ke sthaan par n, j, nya ke sthaan par na tathaa twa ke sthaan par tun batalaai gai he or magadhi kii sh, s, ke sthaan par ksha j ke sthaan par y, ksha ke sthaan par ek ahan ke sthaan par hake, hage va ahake, tathaa acarant karta kaarak ekvachan ke ant main e kahi gai hai
 The last 12th passage of Prakrit light appears to be added far back
 isapar bhamah va anya kisi kii tikaa nahin he
 The condition of this passage is very unique
 isamen shauraseni ke lakshan batalaaye gaye hai, jisaki aadi main hi prakruti sanskrit kahi gai hai
 But in the last 32nd sutra it has been said again: Hr Shesham Maharashtri Vat
 parantu maharashtri shabd isse purv granth bhar main athwa anya kahin vyakaran main aayaa hi nahin he
 It seems that this passage has been added at a time when the notion was strengthened that the language of Prakrit poetry should be Maharashtri
 atev jahaan praakrit kaa nirdesh he, vahaan maharashtri kaa hi taatpary grahan kiya jaay
 From the form of Shaurseni which has been described here, it is clear from this that the form which has been told here of the common nature, is the developed form of Shaurseni itself
 udaahranarth shauraseni main madhyavarti t or th ke sthaan kramash: d or dh hote hai, vahaan praakrit main d kaa lop or tha kaa ha hota he
 "bh" of metal remains "bho" in Shaurseni, but in Prakrit there is a command "ho"
 shauraseni main napunsak bahuvachan ke rup main vahaan ni hota he, jaise jalaani, vanani, vahaan praakrit ke keval i rahata he, jaise jalaain, vanain shauraseni main dola, dand tathaa dasan kaa aadi d prakruti rup rahata he, jabaki praakrit main vah d ho jaataa he, jaise dola, dand va dasan ityadi
 After Prakritprakash, the Prakrit grammar was written by Hemachandra in the 12th century AD, making a complete representation of Prakrit and its regional languages
 iske chaar pariched hai, jinamein se lagbhag saadhe teen parichchhedon main praakrit kaa suvyavasthit vivaran diya gaya he or shesh lagbhag 200 sutron main kramash: shauraseni, magadhi, pashachi, chulika pashachi or apbhransh bhashaaon ke vishesh lakshan batalaaye hai
 The form of the first three of these languages is the same as the one detailed above
 chulika pashachi ke lakshan yahan chaar sutron main ye batalaaye gaye hai ki usamen tisare or chauthe varno ke sthaan par pratham or dwitiya kaa aadesh hota he, r kaa l vikalp se hota he, kuch aacharyo ke mat se adivarna kii dhwani main parivartan nahin hota, shesh baaten pashachi ke samaan janani chahie

 eid-ul-juha is a major festival of people who believe in the religion of Islam
 ramajaan ke pavitra maheene kii samaapti ke lagbhag 70 dinon baad ise manaaya jaataa he
 According to Islamic belief, Hazrat Ibrahim inscribed his son Hazrat Ismail on the same day, on the order of God that he was going to sacrifice in the way, then Allah gave life to his son, in whose memory this festival is celebrated
 is shabd kaa bakron se koi sambandh nahin he
 Nor is it a Urdu word
 asal main arabi main 'baqar' kaa arth he bada jaanavar jo jibah kiya jaataa he
 Today, it is called 'bakra Eid' in India, Pakistan and Bangla country
 id-e-qurbaan kaa matlab he balidaan kii bhaavana
 In Arabic, 'karb' is said to be close or very close, meaning on this occasion God becomes very close to human being
 qurbaani us pashu ke jibah karne ko kehete hai jise 10, 11, 12 yaa 13 jilhijj ko khuda ko khush karne ke liye zibih kiya jaataa he
 It is written in the Quran: If we gave you hauz-e-qausa, then you offer your prayers to Allah and make sacrifices
 id ul ajaha kaa tyohaar hijri ke aakhri maheene jul hijj main manaaya jaataa he
 Muslims from all over the world gather in Mecca and Saudi Arabia to celebrate Haj in this month
 id ul ajaha bhi isi din manaai jaati he
 In fact it is a part payment of Hajj and the day of Muslim sentiment
 duniya bhar ke musalamaanon kaa ek samooh makka main haj karata he baaki musalamaanon ke antarrashtriya bhav kaa din ban jaataa he
 Eid ul ajaha literally means a sacrificial Eid
 Offering a sacrifice of an animal on this day is a symbolic sacrifice
 haj or uske saath judi hui paddati hazrat ibrahim or unke parivaar dwaara kiye gaye kaaryon ko pratikatmak taur par dohraane kaa naam he
 Hazrat was survived by his wife Hajra and son Ismail
 manyata he ki hazrat ibrahim ne ek swapn dekha tha jisamen vah apane putr ismail kii qurbaani de rahe the hazrat ibrahim apane das varshiya putr ismail ko ishwar kii raah par qurbaan karne nikal pade
 It comes in the books that God sent his angels to sacrifice an animal in place of Ismail
 darasal ibrahim se jo asal qurbaani maangi gai thi vah thi unki khud kii thi arthath ye ki khud ko bhul jaao, matlab apane sukh-aaraam ko bhuulakar khud ko maanavtaa / insaaniyat kii seva main puri tarah se laga do
 Then he decided to settle his son Ismail and his mother Hajra in Mecca
 lekin makka us samay registan ke sivaa kuch na tha
 After settling them in Mecca, he himself left for human service
 is tarah ek registan main basna unki or unke puure parivaar kii qurbaani thi jab ismail bade hue to udhar se ek kafila gujara or ismail kaa vivaah us kafile main se ek yuvati se kara diya gaya phir praranmbh hua ek vansh jise itihaas main ishmailits, yaa vanu ismail ke naam se janaa gaya

 Gross domestic product or GDP or GDP is a basic measure of the economic performance of an economy, the market value of all final goods and services within a nation's range in a year
 GDP ko teen prakaar se paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he, jinamein se sabhi avadharanatmak rup se samaan hai
 First, it is equal to the total expenditure incurred for all final goods and services produced within a country in a given time period
 doosraa, yah ek desh ke bheetar ek avadhi main sabhi udyogon ke dwaara utpaadan kii prayek avasthaa par kul vardhit mulya or utpaadon par sabsidi rahit kar ke yoga ke baraabar he
 Third, it is equal to the sum of the income generated by production in the country over a period — that is, the amount of workers' compensation, taxes on production and subsidized imports and gross operating surplus
 GDP ke maapan or maatr nirdhaaran kaa sabase aam tarika he kharch yaa vyay vidhi : "gross" means the depreciation of capital share has not been subtracted from GDP
 yadi shuddh nivesh ko uparyukt sameekaran main sakal nivesh ke sthaan par lagaaya jaae, to shuddh gharelu utpaada kaa sutara praapt hota he
 Consumption and investment in this equation are expenditure on final goods and services
 sameekaran kaa niryaat - aayaat vaala bhaag, gharelu rup se utpann nahin hone vaale vyay ke bhaag ko ghataakar or ise phir se gharelu kshetra main jod kar samyojit karata he
 Economists like to divide the term general consumption into two parts; Private consumption and public sector spending

 ek ghar ke dwaara nae awaas par vyay karnaa bhi nivesh main shaamil hai
 Contrary to its colloquial meaning, 'investment' in GDP does not mean the purchase of financial products
 vittiya utpaadon ke kray ko 'bachat' ke rup main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, nivesh ke rup main nahin
 The distinction is clear: if money is converted into goods or services, it is investment; But, if you buy a bond or a share of a stock, this transfer payment is set aside from GDP
 to stock or band paroksh rup se GDP ko prabhavit karte hai
 Although such purchases are commonly called investments, from a total economic point of view it is simply an exchange of contracts and not a part of actual production or GDP
 isamen koi hastantaran bhugtan jaise saamaajik suraksha yaa berogari ke laabh shaamil nahin hai
 Examples of C, I, g and NX: If you spend money to renovate your hotel, so that rates of occupancy increase, it is a private investment, but if you buy shares in a consortium to do the same It is a saving
 GDP ke maapan ke dauraan pehle vaala kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, baad vaale kaa nahin
 But, when the union makes its own spending on renewal, this expenditure will be included in GDP
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi ek hotel nijee ghar he, tab navinikaran vyay ko upbhog mana jayega, lekin yadi ek sarkari agency hotel ko naagarik sevaao ke ek karyaalay main badal rahi he, to navinikaran vyay ko saarvjaanik kshetra vyay kaa ek bhaag mana jayega
 If the renewal involves the purchase of a chandelier from abroad, the expenditure is also calculated as an increase in imports, so that the value of NX falls and total GDP is affected by purchasing
 yadi ek gharelu nirmaataa ko ek videshi hotel ke liye jhumar banane ke liye bhugtan kiya jaataa he, to sthiti vipareet hogi or bhugtan kii gananaa NX main kii jaaegi 
 phir se, GDP vyay ke madhyam se utpaadan kaa maapan karata he; yadi utpann jhumar ko domestic rup se karidaa gaya he, to ise GDP aankadon main shaamil kiya gaya hoga, jab ek upabhokta yaa vyaper ke dwaara ise karidaa gaya he, lekin kyonki iskaa niryaat kiya gaya tha to gharelu rup se utpann raashi ko dene ke liye gharelu rup se upbhog kii gai raashi ko "thik" karnaa jaruri he

 vaastavik GDP vruddhi kii gananaa karne se arthshaastriyon ko yah nirdhaarit karne main madad milti he ki mudra kii kray kshamta main parivartan se aprabhavit rahete hue, utpaadan kam hua he yaa badhaa he
 Another way to measure GDP is to measure the total income payable in GDP income accounts
 is sthiti main, kabhi kabhi sakal gharelu utpaada ke bajaay sakal gharelu aay kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 By this, the same figures should be obtained which are obtained in the above expenditure method
 = GDP 
 vyavhaar main, haalanki, jab rashtriya sankhyikeey agenciyon ne report di to maapan truti kii vajah se donon aankadon kaa maapan halkaa sa alag paaya gaya
 Using the income approach, the formula for measured GDP is called GDP, which is: isamen aksar adhikansh chote vyavsaay shaamil hai
 The sum total of COE, GOS and GMI is called total factor income and it calculates the value of GDP at factor values
 buniyadi keemton or antim keemton ke bich kaa antar kul kar or sabsidiyaan hai jinhen sarkaar ne utpaadan par lagu kiya he yaa bhugtan kiya he
 So adding subsidy-free tax on imports and production converts GDP to GDP at factor cost
 ek anya sutara is prakaar se likhaa ja saktaa he: : Where r = rent i = interest p = profit SA = statistical adjustment w = wages GDP ko sakal rashtriya utpaada, ke vipareet mana ja saktaa he, jiskaa upyog sanyukt rajya america ne 1992 tak apane rashtriya khaaton main kiya
 The difference is that GNP consists of net foreign income rather than net exports and imports

 GDP us kshetra se sambandhit he jisamen aay utpann hoti he
 It is the market value of the total out put generated in a nation in a year
 GDP is baat par dhyaan detaa he ki out put kahan utpann ho rahaa he, is baat par nahin ki ise koun utpann kar rahaa he
 GDP measures all domestic products irrespective of their nationality of production units
 iske vipareet, GNP ek kshetra kii 'rashtriyata' ke dwaara utpann out put ke maan kaa maapan karata he
 GNP pays attention to who owns the production
 udhaaharan ke liye, sanyukt rajya america main, GNP america companiyon dwaara utpaadit out put ke maan kaa maapan karata he chaahe ye companiyaan kahin par bhi sthit hon

 There may be differences between the two approaches in the comparative ranking of countries

 adhik jaankaree ke liye dekhen rashtriya aay or utpaadan ke maapan Per capita GDP is not a measure of standard of living in an economy
 haalanki, aksar ise is prakaar ke sanketak ke rup main prayukt kiya jaataa he, is tark par ki sabhi naagarik apane desh ke bade hue aarthik utpaadan kaa laabh praapt karenge
 Similarly, GDP is not a measure of personal income per capita
 ek desh ke adhikansh nagarikon kii aay main kami aane par yaa an-anupaatik rup se parivartan hone par bhi GDP main vruddhi ho sakati he
 For example, in the US between 1990 and 2006, the income of individual workers in private industries and services increased by 0
5% per year, while GDP increased by 3
6% per year during the same period
 jivan str ke ek sanketak ke rup main prati vyakti GDP kaa pramukh laabh he ki ise baar baar, lagaataar or vyapak rup se mapa jaataa he; baar baar kaa arth he ki adhikansh desh GDP par jaankaree tremasik aadhaar par uplabdh karaate hai, vyapak rup se arthath isamen GDP kaa kuch maap duniya ke har desh ke liye praayogic rup se uplabdh hota he or lagaataar arthath GDP ke bheetar prayukt takneekee paribhaashaayen, deshon ke bich tulanaatmak rup se sthir rahati hai or isliye yah vishwaas bana rahata he ki prayek desh main samaan maapan kiya ja rahaa he
 a major disadvantage of using GDP as an indicator of standard of living is that it is not strictly a measure of standard of living
 GDP ek desh main aarthik gatividhi ke kisi vishisht prakaar kaa maapan karata he
 According to the definition of GDP, it is not necessary to measure the standard of living
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek charam udhaaharan main, ek desh jisane apane 100 pratishat utpaadan kaa niryaat kiya or kuch bhi aayaat nahin kiya to bhi uskaa GDP ucch hoga, lekin jivan str bahut hi nimna hoga
 The use of GDP does not argue that it is a good indicator of standard of living, but is instead that living standards tend to rise in the event that GDP per capita rises
 yah GDP ko jivan str ke pratyaksh maap ke bajaay use iskaa pratinidhi banataa he
 Per capita GDP can be seen as a representative of labor productivity
 jaise jaise shramikon kii utpaadakta badhati he, karmchaariyon ko unke liye adhik mazdooree dekar pratispardhaa kerani chahie
 Conversely, if productivity is low, wages must be reduced or businesses will not be able to make a profit
 GDP ke is upyog ke bare main kai vivaad hai
 GDP is widely used by economists to measure the health of an economy, as its varieties are identified relative to the immediate
 haalanki, jivan str ke sanketak ke rup main iskaa maan simit mana jaataa he
 Criticisms of how GDP is used include: vastav main, aay asamanta main alpakaalik vruddhi, aay kii asamanta main dirghakaalik kami kaa kaarak ho sakati he

 newjiland ke arthshaastri marilin waring ne is baat par prakaash daalaa ki avaitnaik kaary main kaarak ke rup main ek thos prayaas kiya jaataa he to yah avaitnaik shram ke anyaay ko nasht karne kaa prayaas karegaa or saath hi loktantr ke liye aavashyak rajnatik paardarshita or javabdehi bhi uplabdh karaayega
 There is some doubt on this claim, however, the same principle led the economist Douglas North to win the Nobel Prize in 1993
 north ne tark diya ki nijee avishkaar or udhyam ko protsaahit karne ke dwaara, patent pranali kaa nirmaan or ise majbootee pradaan karnaa, england main audyogic kranti ke peeche mul utprerak ban gaya
 It is possible that the monetary value of the item sold in the first case is higher than in the second case, in which case the higher GDP is the result of greater inefficiency and waste

 kuch paryaavarniya laagat jaise tel spil kii safai ko GDP main shaamil kiya jaataa he
 Economic development ends at a huge cost at the cost of environmental degradation; GDP does not keep a record of this
 udhaaharan ke liye, pichley 80 varshon main sanyukt rajya america ke prati vyakti GDP ko yadi aalu kii kray kshamta ke dwaara mapa jaae to isamen ullekhneey vruddhi nahin hui he
 But if it is measured by the purchasing power of the egg, it has occurred many times
 is kaaran se, aam taur par kai deshon kii tulana karne vaale arthshaastri kai prakaar kii vastuon se yukt tokari kaa prayog karte hai
 This type of adjustment for an exchange rate is controversial because it is difficult to find comparable baskets of goods to compare purchasing capacity in countries
 udhaaharan ke liye, aisa ho saktaa he ki desh a main sthaneey rup se utane hi sebon kaa upbhog kiya ja rahaa he jitne ki desh b main
 lekin desh a ke seb adhik swaadisht kism ke hai
 Such a difference in content will not be evident in GDP figures
 yah vishesh rup se us maal ke liye sahi he jinka vyaper vishwa str par nahin hota he, jaise ki awaas
 The GDP framework cannot tell us whether the final goods and services generated during a specific period are a reflection of the actual termination expansion, or a reflection of capital consumption
 unhone jari rakhte hue kaha: For example, if a government is building a pyramid that has nothing for personal welfare, GDP will include it in economic growth
 In reality, however, building this pyramid will divert real wealth from wealth-producing activities, By which the production of property will be transferred

 Dharamdas was a disciple of Kabir Das and his contemporary saint and Hindi poet
 dhani dharmadas ko chhattisgadhi ke aadi kavi kaa darja praapt he
 After Kabirdas, Harmadas was the greatest ninja of Kabirpanth
 sant dharamdas ko kabir ke shishyon main sarvapramukh maanane kii pravriti pai jaati hai, kintu ye unke thik samasamyik bhi nahin thaharte
 According to the table of the Kabirpanthi tradition of the 'chhattisgarhi branch' called by him, his emergence period does not seem to go before the second or first phase of the 17th century of Vikram Samvat, due to which he becomes a successor of Kabir
 isi prakaar katipay sampradayik granthon tathaa swayan inaki bhi kuch panktiyon dwaara inkaa unhen, jindarup main tathaa videhi banakar 'jhina paras' dikhalaate hue hi, maananaa, siddh hota he
 Apart from this, it is also clear from Gyandeepak of Dariya Saheb of Bihar that Kabir Sahib himself, as Dharamdas, had incarnated two hundred years back and started a new cult
 atev adhik sambhav he ki inhone unke adarsh evam upadeshon se vishesh prerana grahan karke hi unhen gururup main sweekaar kar liya ho
 Nevertheless, most of the followers of Kabir Panth believe in the direct meeting of these two and accordingly give their life circle
 kehete hai ki inkaa purv naam 'judaavan' tha or ye kasaughan baniyaa the, inkaa nivas sthaan bandhavgarh tha
 His wife's name was Amin and he also had two sons named Narayan Das and Chudamani, the first of whom was opposed to Kabir Sahib
 ye pehle vaishnavadharm main dikshit rah chuke the or inke guru kaa naam rupadas tha
 After traveling to many pilgrimages, in the third part of his life, he once saw Kabir Sahib in Mathura and then both met in Kashi
 iske ananthar kabir sahab kaa inke yahan banghgarh janaa, inhen upadesh dena tathaa inke dwaara kabir panth kaa prachaar kiya janaa bhi kaha gaya he
 Similarly, it is famous that he died in Puri where he lived with Kabir Sahib and his samadhi was also built here
 sant dharamdas dwaara rache anek granthon ke naam die jate hai or unamem adhiktar inkaa, kabir sahab ke saath, samvaad vaa prashnottar paaya jaataa he jisase inke dwaara unka rachit bhi hona purnat: siddh nahin ho paata
 a collection of his many retail books is titled 'dhani Dharamdas Ki Bani' published by Belvedere Press of Prayag
 vahaan par ye ek sagunopa bhakt ke rup main dikhalaai padate hai or inaki kabir sahab ke prati pragadh bhakthi evam shraddha prakat hoti he
 Kabir Sahib seems to be there with his presiding deity and accepts him as a master or a husband, with passion
 inke dwaara pradarshit bhaavon main hriday kii sachai lakshith hoti he tathaa inkaa apni ant:sadhana kaa varnan bhi bahut spasht va saral he
 Dadupanthi Raghavdas has given the names of seven of his disciples under his devotees and the first two of them namely Chudamani and the Chancellor have been referred to as 'naati'
 shesh paanch main se jagu, bhagata or surat gopal, vastut: inke gurubhai rup main hi adhik prasiddh hai tathaa sahibadas evam dalhan ke vishay main kaai pataa nahin chalata
 The discussion of his biography still seems to bear the imprint of mythology, but due to this his importance cannot be diminished
