 Of course God i pray for your family, who has created you and those who were before you, be no stranger, you become a sparring who made a land for you and a roof to the sky and rained water from the sky
 Make hawk fruits for your food, do not make anyone a god, even though you know well, and if you people are so ignorant of this act that we have taken away Lying in A
 PS If you are truthful you create a chapter that except Bring Khuhda Also call them your helpers too
 If you cannot do this and cannot do it at all, then you will be afraid of that fire, there will be men and stones, and it is prepared for the infidels and the people who brought imaan and did noble things
 Give them the good news that there are gardens for them under which the nahis are continuing, when they will get some nuts of these gardens then they will say that they got the same appearance and color
 There will be clean and clean wives for them in the past and they will always live in that garden
 Of course, there is no example of a mosquito or even more than that, those who have come to believe that they believe are sure that they are absolutely right
 And it is from the side of the family, those people who are Kafirs, they say what God means by that example, By such an example, God instructs many people, but even leaving them in the lurch, those people who break the Gods after having strengthened the Ehodo scale and whom God has ordered, he condemns them and in the country They go on fighting, they are the ones who are going to suffer the loss, why can you deny God, even though you were lifeless, he lived you and then he killed you Ga, Then he will make you live, then you will be brought back to him
 He is the one who created all the things in your land, and then the sky is furious, then the seven skies are made equal and he is aware of everything and remember that time
 When your family told the angels that i am going to build a land in the land, i started saying, will you create a person who wants to live in the land However, it is to be made a caliphate because we praise and appreciate you and prove your honesty, then God said that there is no doubt that what i know you do not know and taught Adam the names of all things and then the angels And presented that in front of you that if you are in your claim that we are against Mustache

 Of course he is very sorry and when you told Moses, o Moses, we will not believe you till we see God clearly
 You were electrocuted by that and you continued to squirm, then after you died, we raised the district so that you would thank you and we overshadowed you and brought down your mind and salvation
 And eat the spicy and nutritious rosaries that you have given them, and those people did not spoil us any more, but they took a beating on their lives and when we told you to go to this village and eat in it wherever you want and eat at the door While doing and saying Hitta Bakshish to the tongue, we will give you this credit and we will increase the righteousness of those who do good, then the body changed what was said to them Then canceled starting another thing to say we had looked prank on them Because of their malfeasance, the sky rose, and when Moses asked for water for his demise, we said, hit your stick on the stone, twelve glasses came out of it and all the people knew their ghat well and we gave the general permission
 That you should eat and drink from the God given life, and then do not get into trouble in the country
 When you told Moses, o Moses, you will not be able to eat from us, you pray for us from your family
 That things grow out of the ground like greens, greens and cucumber and wheat or produce lentils and onions instead
 Do you want to change something that is better in every way than adna cheese, then get off in a city, then your All that you have asked for is present and they were beaten by the Russians and Mohtaji, and those people turned their back towards God, All this happened due to the fact that they denied the signs of God and undeservedly martyred the Prophets and because of that they used to dislike and sobriety, of course Muslims and Jews and Nusranis and Lamazhabas who are God and Rozah At last, Iman will be brought and if he keeps on doing good work, then for his sake, his soul and soul are with his God and neither will anyone be afraid of him nor will he be heartbroken and When we took you away from you and we hanged your head with a turf and said that you should keep holding on to what we have given to you and remember what is in it so that you become a spartan then after that you go again
 If God had not given you the blessings and grace, you would have incurred a heavy loss and by your demise you know the condition of those people who have passed their limits on the day of Shambe
 We told them that you become a monkey were Rainde PS We have this Wakhye For the people who had been in front of them and who were to come after them, they had done wonders for the sake of the abstinence, and when Moses told his people that God commanded you to ask a man to sing what he started saying
 You plead with us, Moses said, i ask for shelter from God that i should be goth, pray for your God to tell us how the cow should be
 Moses said of course God Has Frmata that he is much older Neither cow or heifer rather the average graduate from them, The person who ordered you to play the music, he started saying that you pray to your God to tell us what its color is
 Moses said, Of course, God proves that the cow is very dark, it is very happy to see him
 When we are done, then you say that you pray to your God that you should tell us how much it is and if the cow mixes in the cows and God wants it, then we will definitely find out
 Moses said Uhda sure Frmata that it is not the cows not so Sdhai that land Jothe not cultivate Sichen well healed that there are no blur of color, he said now the exact statement, Pity those people did that cow Halal, although they did not expect them to do so and when a person was killed and there was a split in you, they started telling each other what you were hiding
 We said that take a piece of that cow and kill it, so God makes the dead alive and shows you the traces of his nature so that you understand then after that your The stones were hardened as if they were of stone or even more powerful because the hawks in the stones are such that the canals are released from them and the hawks are such that they crack and water comes out of them and the hawk The stones are such that they fall from the fear of God and they are not guilty of what you are doing, do you have the greed that they will believe you, however they There was a gang of people that used to narrate the story of God and after understanding it well He used to turn around even though he knew well and when we meet people who believe then they say that we have believed and when they have betrayed them, they say that whatever God has i have revealed to you what you will tell so that you can bring honor to your God tomorrow, do you not understand that much, but do those people not know what those people hide Or reveal that God knows everything and some of them are illiterate that they do not understand the books of God other than what they mean, and they do the right things, i like the people who write the book with their own hands, then they are from God so that they can get a little price from it, i regret that their hands have written and then they regret that such earnings Do and say that even after a few days of counting, we will not touch fire, tell these people if you have taken any contract from God, then somehow he is against his property
 Do not do or understand, i add bogey to God
 Yes, those who have achieved evil and their sins have surrounded it from all around, the same people are shocked and they will always be there and those who are honest and have done good deeds
 The same people know that they will always live in paradise, and when we took Ahad and scale from the created Israel, it is better not to pray to anyone except God and the parents and the warlords and the jatim Get along well with people and people and talk well with people Doing and reciting equal prayers and giving zakat, then some of you went back apart from the men and you are the only people who have turned away from the land and when we had prayed to you not to live in harmony and not to spoil our people
 You had denied it and you also testify about it, then you are the same people who kill each other and become unarmed and forcefully support each other from their own groups
 You make the city bad, if the same people come to you as prisoners, then they redeem them, though their removal was forbidden to you, then do you believe in hawks and deny the hawk in you? Those who do this should be punished for nothing but a life-long ruse, and be returned to a hard day on the Day of Judgment and whatever you do, you will be disgusted with it
 It is not these people who buy the life of the world instead of last Not only will they be tested in their wonders, nor will they be given any help and it is a matter of fact that we have given the book to Moses and after that many prophets should take their steps and accept Jesus' son Jesus And provided the light and helped them through Pakistan's spirit, have you become so disgraceful that when a prophet has a hook against you, your wishes and blessings i brought you to the air, then you stubbornly defied the hawk prophets and killed the hawk, and started saying that our hearts are covered with guilt, but because of their kufr, God has cursed them
 And when they have a book from God, which also satisfies them
 Take steps and give merry and light to Mary, son of Mary, and help them through Pakistan spirit Jibreel, have you become so disgraceful that when a prophet came to you with a dictate against your wishes, Nisfani, you swagger When you sat down, you defied the hawk prophets and killed the hawk, and started saying that we have a grudge against our hearts but because of their kufr God has cursed them, very few people believe and when they have a book with God, who also adores them

 Physics of solid state is also known as solid state theory
 yah bhautikee kii vah shakha he jisamen thos kii sanrachana or uske bhautik gunon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 This condensed phase is the largest branch of physics
 thos avasthaa bhautikee main is baat par vichaar kiya jaataa he ki thoson ke vahya gun unke parmaanu-stareey gunon se kis prakaar sambandhit hai
 Thus solid state physics forms the theoretical basis of material science
 iske alaava transistoron kii praudyogiki evam ardhchalkon kii takneekee aadi main iskaa sidhaa upyog bhi hota he
 The major divisions of this subject are: 1
 sanrachana par aadhaarit gun, jaise manibh vigyaan, dhaatuon kii sanrachana kaa siddhant, mishradhatuen, ynic manibh, sansanjak bal, pattit sanrachana aadi ; 2
 Primarily properties of homogeneous solids, such as specific heat, thermal vibration, thermal and electronegativity, superconductivity, light conductivity, magnetic and electrically etc
 3
 thos main vishmaangta tathaa vikrutijnya gun, jaise apdravyata, ardhchaalakata, plastikata, jaalak sanrachana dosha, rang centre bindu dosha, visthaapan siddhant, manibhavikas aadi
 As our knowledge about concrete condition is increasing, attention to the last mentioned qualities is becoming more and more attractive
 dravya teen vibhinn avasthaaon main paaya jaataa he - thos, drav tathaa gas
 The density is very low in the gas state and the compression strength is very high
 iske vipareet thos tathaa drav kaa ghanatv apekshaakrit adhik hota he, kintu sampeden atyant kam
 The code of the unit volume of a gas at ordinary pressure and temperature is approximately millennium of the code of a solid or liquid with the same volume
 apni adhik sampeden samarthy ke kaaran hi gaisen jis baratan main rakhi jaati hai use ve purnataya bhar detii hai
 The volume of a solid changes little by increasing the pressure and its size is also fixed
 thoson main kartanvikar ho saktaa he, jab ki gas yaa drav main yah gun upasthit nahin hota
 On the basis of the difference in physical properties of solids and gases, it can be explained that the distance between the atoms of a gas is much greater than the distance between the atoms of a solid or a liquid
 chunki gas ke ikai aaytan main parmaanuon kii sankhya apekshaakrit kam hoti he, at: uskaa ghanatv bhi thodaa hi hota he
 Then the atomic forces also decrease due to the greater distance between the atoms
 at: inamen ant:parmanviya duriyon ko saralata se badla ja saktaa he
 In the interpretation of the gaseous state, the intrinsic atomic forces can be considered negligible, but this cannot be done in the evolution of solid and fluid theories
 is dasha main ant:parmanviya balon kaa spasht rup se vichaar karnaa hoga, kyonki inamen parmaanu ek duusare ke nikat hai or inke bich laganevaale bal shaktishaalee hai
 There are many types of atomic forces, so the properties of solids are more different than those of gas
 udhaaharan ke liye, paara tathaa argon gasiy avasthaa main bahut samaan gun pradarshit karte hai, jabaki thos or drav dasha main inke gunon main yathesht antar paaya jaataa he
 Solids are divided into two categories, Manibhiya and Amanibhiya
 manibhiya thoson ke andar parmaanuon kii vyavastha main unche darje kii krambaddhata pai jaati he
 Atoms in atomic solids are not arranged in a certain order
 manibhiya thos paanch spasht shakhaon main vibhajit kiye gaye hai : 1
 Metals and alloys, 2
 lavan, 3
 Connective Crystals, 4
 anu manibh tathaa 5
 Semiconductors
 dhaatu or mishradhaatuon main vidyucchalakata tathaa dhatvik chamak pai jaati he
 In these, the property of electronegativity arises due to the variance of free electrons
 lavan main aaweshit aayan hote hai
 Connective crystals are hard materials, such as diamond and silicon carbide
 inkaa galnaank unchaa hota he tathaa inkaa nirmaan praarambhik sanyoji rasayanashastra ke niyamon ke anusaar hota he
 Molecular crystals are solids in which the forces holding permanent molecules are very small
 arthchaalak, jaise zinc oxide yaa copper oxide, aise thos hote hai, jinamein vicharan karanevaale electranon dwaara utpann honevaali vidyucchalakata ksheen maatra main hi pai jaati he
 Amanibh solids exhibit the same properties as those found in molecular and connective crystals
 inaki rachana bade aakaar ke anuon dwaara hoti he, jinke bich ke badhanabal ksheen hote hai tathaa sanyoji bandhan prabal
 Only solid solids whose atoms inside are arranged in three independent directions according to the three-dimensional mesh structure are considered for the study of the solid state
 is adhyayan main kaanch yaa bahulak ke gun bhi sanmilit kiye ja sakate hai, yadhyapi inke andar manibhon kii tulana main sanrachanaatmak niyamitata nimnatar koti kii hoti he
 The glass structure resembles a stereoscopic lattice
 yah aavarti nahin hoti
 The polymer is made up of parallel groups of large-sized molecules, whose composition may also resemble those of crystals in some cases
 saamanyat: pratibal padane par thos dridhtaa kaa gun pradarshit karte hai
 The corresponding pathology is very reversible
 phir bhi sthir bhaar daalane par kuch na kuch shyaneey pravaah utpann ho hi jaataa he
 The development of the study of solid state theory can be divided into four stages: 1
 sthool gun, visheshtya sthool samamiti ; 2
 Lattice theory and lattice model; 3
 paripurna manibhon ke gunon kaa parmaanu siddhant dwaara pratipaadan tathaa 4
 Development of the principle of imperfection of manibhas
 punarjagran kaal se lekar, jabaki is vishay ke adhyayan kaa prarambh hua tha, pichhali shatabdi ke ant tak logon kaa dhyaan pratham charan par vishesh rup se kendrit rahaa tha
 Interest in lattice theory was initially limited to abstract or theoretical aspects only
 isane vyaavhaarik rup tab dhaaran kiya, jab pratham mahayuddh ke thik purv is baat kii khoj kii ja chuki thi ki manibhon kii jaaleey sanrachana se eks kirnon kaa vivartan ek adwitiya dhang se hota he
 The atomic theory was first applied at the end of the last century for the primary determination of the properties of gemstones
 par is paddati ne san 1925 or 1928 ke bich, jab aadhunik kwantum yantriki evam tarang yantriki kaa samuchit vikaas ho chukaa tha, purnataa praapt kii
 The systematic study of the imperfection of gemstones began around 1925
 yah apane charam vikaas par san 1945 ke baad pahunchaa
 The goal of solid state theory is to represent various properties of solids based on parametric and nuclear principles
 ab tak vistaar se adhyayan kiye gaye vishay nimnlikhit hai : pratyaasthi tathaa sughaty aacharan, sansanjan tathaa sansanjan urjaayen, electrovneey parivahan ; yneey parivahan ; vishisht ooshmaa; chumbakeey gun; vidyutpaarak gun; phero vaidyut gun; prakaashiya gun tathaa nabhikeey or electroneey anuwaad
 The above mentioned areas come under the purview of fundamental scientific research done under the theory of solid state
 in kshetron ke katipay brihat ansh vyaavhaarik yaa takneekee kaarnon se vishesh mahatv praapt kar sake hai
 The division of technical areas is mainly as follows: metallurgy; Semiconductor; Clay craft, which is based on the properties of salts and valence compounds; Polymer Chemistry and Magnetism
 thosiya avasthaa ke mesaron ke vishay ne, jo ek vishesh prakaar ke electroneey anunaad ko pradarshit karanevaale padaarthon se sambandhit he, aadhunik technology main pramukh sthaan praapt kar liya he
 The variation of properties of different solids is due to the difference in forces between their constituent atoms and the variation of the order of atoms
 parmaanu siddhant ke anusaar parmaanu jab dur-dur rahete hai to ve ek duusare ko aakarshith karte hai or jab ve ek duusare ke atyant nikat rahete hai to ve ek duusare ko pratikarshith karte hai
 The energy of reaction between different atoms first decreases, then it assumes the minimum value and then it increases by accident
 nunatam maan us vakt hota he jab aakarshan or pratikarshan ke bal ek duusare ke baraabar ho jate hai
 The position of atoms for minimum energy depends on which chemical category these atoms belong to
 nunatam paraspar kriya ke pariman se ant:parmanviya bandhan kii prabalata kii naap gyaat hoti he
 Find out the mechanism of atomic delivery within the solid with the help of X-rays
 manibh thoson par kiye gaye prayogon ke anusaar trivimeetiya jaaleey sanrachana ke prayek falak par parmaanuon kaa samaan vitaran hota he
 The regular ordering of atoms inside a non-soluble solid is found to be of lower order
 ksheen vidyucchalakatawaale thos, jaise saamaanya dhaatuon ke oxide tathaa chloride, paraphin, tathaa visanvahi amanibhiya thos, jaise silica kaanch, rasayan ke saamaanya sanyojaktaa siddhant ke niyamon kaa paalan karte hai
 In contrast, metals with high electronegativity coincide with each other according to the general laws of valency chemistry
 udhaaharan ke liye tanba bina apni jaaleey sanrachana main antar utpann kiye hue 30 pratishat tak jasta apane main vilay kar saktaa he
 These metals form compounds that bear no resemblance to the properties of the constituent ingredients
 udhaaharan ke liye, tanba or jasta se ve yogic banate hai jinke sutara tay tathaa ta5 ya8 hai
 Compounds of metallic combinations can be of two types: substituted alloys and interstitial alloys
 inke sangyojan ke niyamon kaa adhyayan hum rothare tathaa haig ne kiya
 In substituted alloys, the proportion of constituent metals inside the solution changes as the atoms of one metal are replaced by atoms of another metal
 yah paaya gaya he ki in yogicon main donon dhaatuon ke parmaanuon ke vyas main 15 pratishat se adhik kaa antar nahin hota
 An example of this is the different varieties of brass obtained by mixing zinc in different proportions
 antaraleey mishradhaatuon main ek dhaatu ke parmaanu itane chote hote hai ki ve duusari dhaatu ke parmaanu kii jagah par feet baith saken
 Therefore, some part of the metal structure of these metals is formed by the atom of another metal
 sanyog karanevaali dhaatuen yadi vidyudvahak shrenee main ek duusare ke nikat sthit hon or yadi chote akaarawale parmaanu kaa vyas duusari dhaatu ke parmaanu ke vyas ke 0
59 gune se kam ho, tab ye sahaj hi antaraleey mishradhatuen bana leti hai
 Alloys formed by the merging of carbon into iron are examples of this caste
 thos kii bhautik akruti nirdhaarit karanevaale siddhant ooshmaa gativigyaan main kisi nikaay kii sthaayee avasthaa ko vyaavhaarik kaaryon ke liye nirupit karne ke liye aavashyak he ki nunatam hon
 Here there is free energy, there is energy of that body, there is heat and there is entropy
 paramashunya taap par 
 Therefore, a permanent state will occur only when there is a minimum
 sankhyikeey yantriki ke anusaar ek aisi raashi he jo kaa nirantar vruddhi karanevaala ekadisht falan he
 When the temperature of a solid increases beyond zero then the possibility of change in the religion of equilibrium arises
 thoson main nimna taap par manibh rup dhaaran karne kii pravriti pai jaati he
 When the temperature rises, the effect of the post can take one of the following forms: 1
 samya sthitiyon ke chaturdik parmaanu dolan karne lag jate hai
 This violation of order is universally expressed in all solids
 2
 jaaleey sanrachana main aisa parivartan aa saktaa he ki parmaanuon kii adhik swatantraaa praapt ho jaae
 This change is called non-uniform change
 gandhak main kai apararupi parivartan hote hai
 3
 Interchange of pairs of atoms in the lattice structure can result in interference
 mishradhaatuon main praaia: yah baat pai jaati he
 4
 In molecular crystals and salts, such as ammonium chloride, the lattice structure can be interfered with by specific molecules or radicals
 5
 phir, jaaleey sanrachana ke andar kii apni saamaanya sthiti se ikke-dukke parmaanu pravrajan kar antaraleey sthiti main, yaa sataha par pahunchne ke kaaran bhi, jaaleey kram main vyatikram utpann kar sakate hai
 Experiments have confirmed that diffusion and ion conductivity are the result of similar changes
 6
 dravan tathaa urdhvapathan jaaleey vyavastha ke charam vyatikram ke falswaroop ghatit hote hai
 7
 Free electrons are present in metals
 chalishnutaa unhen unche darje kii ooshmaachalakata tathaa vidyucchalakata pradaan karti he
 Any of these chaos can lead to absorption of thermal energy
 avashoshit urja hi vishisht ooshmaa pradaan karti he, jisase taap main vruddhi hoti he yaa phir vah gupt ooshmaa kaa rup dhaaran kar leti he
 Solids found in nature are not completely firm
 bal ke lagane par inamen vikruti utpann ho jaati he
 If the body takes its full form after removing the force, then it is called the elastic solid
 iske pratikul bal hataa lene par yadi vah apni purv akruti dhaaran na kar sake to ise plastic kahenge
 Steel and rubber are examples of solids residing within a long boundary, and putty exhibits plastic properties almost from the earliest stage
 prati ikai lambaai main utpann honevaali vikruti ko tanaav vikruti kehete hai, tathaa prati ikai lambaai main utpann honevaale sampeden ko sampidya vikruti kehete hai
 The value of the force per unit area in the body is called stress
 yadi ek ytaakar nipind a ba sa da kaa falak ba sa kas diya jaae or yadi iskaa virupan a" ba" sa" da" akruti main kar diya jaae to is virupan ko kartan kehete hai
 Each atom of a solid remains in equilibrium state between attraction and repulsion forces
 bal aropit kiye jane par ye parmaanu naveen sthitiyaan praapt kar lete hai, tab ham kehete hai ki thos vikrut ho gaya
 The extent of elasticity depends on the nature of the stress to be charged, the material receiving the deformation and its prior history
 taral sthitik daab se bahut adhik vikruti utpann kii ja sakati he
 Invertebrate solids such as glass become brittle at low temperatures, but many geminal solids, such as metals, exhibit abundant tensile near extreme zero temperatures
 anek thoson ke plastic pravaah kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he
 Consequently the following important rules have been obtained: 1
 khisakanevaale dharaatal kii sidh main manibh ke vibhinn bhaagon ke aapekshik sthanantaran ke kaaran plastic vikruti utpann hoti he
 2
 The appropriate condition for transfer to the ground of the sliding surface is determined by the result of the shearing stress that is dissolved in that plane
 saamanyat: sthanantaran us samay hoga jab kartan pratibal ek nishchit kranthik kartan pratibal ke maan se adhik ho jayega
 The value of critical shearing stress also increases with the decrease of plastic deformation
 is ghatana kii kaaryakthorikaran kehete hai
 3
 There is a certain temperature above which the effect of work hardening disappears when the temperature rises
 is taap ko punarmridukaran taap kehete hai
 The value of the critical shearing stress depends on the temperature up to below the rehydration temperature
 dhaatuon kii ucch tanyata kaa pradurbhaav unki apdravyata ke kaaran hota he
 After 1930, when quantum mechanics was used to determine the behavior of the valence electrons, there was a special progress in the theory of solid state at the same time
 thos sambandhi anusandhan main kwantum yantriki kaa prayukt kiya janaa bahut kuch vaisaa hi he jaisaa mapank pranali ke liye
 When the wavelength of the electronic state is to be determined, the coordinates of the nucleus are considered as parameters
 bourn tathaa openhimer ne hi electronicy gati ko nabhikeey gati se pruthak karne kii vidhi kaa prachlan kiya tha
 Absolute wavefolding is highly soluble for solids
 nimnlikhit do vidhiyaan us bhautik avasthaa ke liye upyukt hai jab ek electron sanniktan kaa upyog kiya jaay : 1
 Parametric constants - In this each electron is associated with a given nucleus and the whole solid is like a group of atoms or molecules
 is prakaar nirupit thos sadaiv hi ek achaalak hota he
 2
 Free electron compaction - In this representation it is assumed that each valence electron rotates freely in the lattice system
 is prakaar tarangafalan kaa aayam parimit ho jaataa he
 This method is applicable to all drivers and large number of semiconductors and conductors
 kwantum yantriki kii vidhiyaan thos ke gunon ke bich parsparik sambandh sthapit karne ke liye vistrut rup se prayukt hoti he
 Among these, the following are particularly notable: sansrujan thos kii sansanjan urja ko is prakaar vyakt kar sakate hai ki yah vah urja he jo thos sataha se kisi electron kii anant tak le jane main vyay hogi, arthath urvapathan kii ooshmaa ke baraabar
 If the energy of the electron is known, then one can get the value of fusion energy
 yah vidhi vibhinn thoson kii aapekshik sansanjan urja kaa maan gyaat karne ke liye bahutayat se kaam main laai jaati he
 Electronegativity The conduction of electricity in a solid is due to the presence of free electrons, or movable ions
 kwantum yantriki kii sabase badi safalataa is baat main he ki dhaatuon or ardhchalkon main electroneey chaalakata kii prakruti iske dwaara thik-thik samajhi ja saki he, kintu nimna taap par pradarshit honevaali atichaalakata ke gun kii vyakhya abhi tak kwantum yantriki ke aadhaar par nahin kii ja saki he
 It is for this reason that perfect solutions to waveform have not yet been possible
 chumbakeeyata ke gun kwantum yantriki kaa vistrut upyog chumbakeey gunon kii vyakhya tathaa unke anusandhan ke nimitt kiya gaya he
 The properties of anomalous magnetic, paramagnetic, and ferromagnetic materials can also be fully explained
 prakaashiya gun thos ke anek prakashkeey gunon kii, jo kuch dinon purv tak rahasypurna bane hue the, ab kwantum yantriki ke aadhaar par sahi vyakhya kii ja saki he
 Most progress has also been made in the study of metals
 mukt electron ke siddhant par swarna, tanba tathaa pital sareekhee mishradhaatuon ke varna kii samuchit vyakhya kii ja saki he
 Quantum mechanics has resolved why alkali metals exhibit transparency properties in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum

 Dharmaraja Yudhishthira bestowed them high honors with due respect

 i am coming now from Amravati, the city of Devraj Indra
 arjuna vahaan par sukhpurvak nivas kar rahe hai
 Through the grace of Lord Shiva and other deities, he has also received the education of dance and music from divine and supernatural weapons and weapons
 ve ab nivaat or kavach naamak asuron kaa vadh karke hi yahan aayenge
 Devraj Indra has sent this message to you that you Pandavas should now make pilgrimage and increase your self-confidence
 devraj indra ke diye gayi sandesh ke anusaar yudhisthir apane bhaaiyon, purohit dhaumy, lomash rishi aadi ko saath le kar tirthayatra ke liye chal pade
 They came to the ashram of Agastya Rishi while taking bath in Naimisharanya, Kanya-tirtha, Ashva-tirtha, Gau-tirtha etc
 lomash rishi ne us ashram kii prashansa karte huye bataaya, “he dharmraj! yah agastya muni evam unki dharmatma patni lopamudra kii pavitra tapasthali he
 Once Agastya Muni arrived while walking here, he saw his ancestors hanging upside down in a pit
 agastya muni ke dwaara unke is prakaar se latakane kaa kaaran poochne par purvajon ne bataaya ki he putr! tumhaare niqusantan hone ke kaaran hamen yah narak kund mila he
 Therefore, marry yourself soon and produce a son, so that we can be saved
 pitruganon kii baat se duhkhi hokar agastya ek suyogy patni kii khoj main nikle or vidarbha desh kii rajkumaari lopamudra se vivaah kar liya
 When Agastya Muni was enchanted by the beauty of Lopamudra and asked her to come to him with the desire of son-daughter, Lopamudra said, 'O Lord! i am a princess, so your meeting with me should be done in a royal manner
 pehle aap dhan kii vyavastha kar ke mere or swayan ke liye sundar vastra tathaa svarnabhushan le kar aaiye
 Impressed by the voice of his wife, Agastya Muni went to Raja Shrutarva, Vraghnash and Ikshvaku Vanshi Trusadrasyu to ask for money, but due to all the kings' treasury being empty, they apologized to Agastya Muni for his money
 niraash hokar agastya muni ilval naamak daitya ke paas pahunche
 The Ilvil monster gave him a lot of money with happiness
 dhan praapt karke agastya muni ne apni patni kii ichhaapoorti kii or drudhsyu naamak putr utpann kiya
 Later, this pilgrimage place became famous as Agastyashram
 isi tirthasthan main snaan karke parashuram ne apana tej punah praapt kiya tha
 That's why Yudhishthira! After bathing here, you regain your glory, snatched by Duryodhana
 ” According to the order of Lomash Rishi, Yudhishthira asked the Lomash sage, “O Lord! Please tell me how Parashuram was languishing? " The sage Lomash replied, "dharmaraja! Dasarathanandan Sri Rama broke the bow of Shiva and married Sita, returning to Ayodhya with his father, brothers, Baratigan, etc
 Then a big storm came and the trees started falling on the earth
 tabhi raja dasharath kii drushti bhrigukul ke parashuram par padi
 Their costumes were very fierce
 tejasvi mukh par badi badi jataayen bikhri hui thim netron main krodh kii laalimaa thi
 There was a hard ax on the shoulder and a bow arrow in the hands
 rishiyon ne aage bad kar unka swaagat kiya or is swaagat ko sweekaar karke ve shri ramachandra se bole “dasharathanandan ram! hamen gyaat hua he ki tum bade parakramee ho or tumne shiv ji ke dhanush ko tod daalaa he or use todakar tumne apurv khyaati praapt kii he
 i have brought a nice bow for you
 yah dhanush saadhaaran nahin he, jamadagnikumar parashuram kaa he
 Put an arrow on it and introduce your valor
 tumhaare bal or shaury ko dekhakar main tumse dwandv yuddh karunga
 Hearing Parashurama's talk, King Dasharatha said in a polite voice, "lord! You are Vedavidya Swadhyayi Brahmin
 kshatriyon kaa vinaash karke aap bahut pehle hi apane krodh kaa shaman kar chuke hai
 That's why o Rishiraj! Donate these boys to Abhay
 ” But Parshuram ji, not paying any heed to Dasaratha's persuasion and said to Rama, “rama! Probably you will not know that only two bow are considered the best in the world
 sara sansar unka sammaan karata hai vishwakarma ne unhen swayan apane haathon se banaaya tha
 Among them, a bow named Pinak was given by the gods to Lord Shiva
 isi dhanush se bhagwaan shiv ne tripurasur kaa vadh kiya tha
 You have broken that bow
 doosraa divya dhanush mere haath main he
 It was given by the gods to Lord Vishnu
 yah bhi pinaak kii bhanti hi shaktishaalee he
 Vishnu gave the bow as an inheritance to Bhriguvanshi Ritchik Muni
 vanshanuvansh rup se yah dhanush mujhe praapt hua he
 Now you, as a Kshatriya, take an arrow with this bow and if successful, fight with me in a duel
 parashuram ke dwaara baar-baar lalakaare jane par ramachandra bole, “he bhargav! main brahman samajhakar aapke saamne vishesh bol nahin rahaa hoon
 But considering this kindness and cowardice of my humility, you are despising me
 laaiye, dhanush baan mujhe dijiye
 Saying this, he took a bow and arrow from Parashuram's hand
 phir dhanush par baan chadhaakar bole, “he bhrigunandan! brahman hone ke kaaran aap mere poojya hai, isaliye is baan ko main aapke upar nahin chhod saktaa
 But this arrow never fails after climbing on the bow
 iskaa kahin na kahin upyog karnaa hi padataa he
 Therefore, through this arrow, i destroy the power of your speedy movement everywhere
 ” shri ram kii yah baat sunakar shaktiheen se huye parashuram ji vinayapurvak kehane lage, “baan chhodane se purv meri ek baat sun lijiye
 After destroying the Kshatriyas, when i donated this land to Kashyap Ji, he told me that you should not live on the earth anymore because you have donated the earth
 tabhi se guruvar kashyap ji kii ajna kaa paalan karata hua main kabhi raatri main prithvi par nivas nahin karata
 Hence, o Ram! Please do not destroy my movement power
 main man ke samaan gati se mahendra parvat par chalaa jaaungaa
 Since the use of this arrow is not fruitless, you should destroy the rare realms which i have conquered by my penance
 aapane jis saralata se is dhanush par baan chadha diya he, usase mujhe vishwaas ho gaya he ki aap madhu rakshas kaa vadh karne vaale sakshat vishnu hai
 By accepting Parashurama's prayer, Rama left the arrow and destroyed all the virtues he had earned on the strength of penance and Parashuram ji was lost
 phir parashuram ji tapasya karne ke liye mahendra parvat par chale gayi
 King Dasaratha along with all the sages and saints present there praised Ram Chandra

 Selection of suitable site is especially necessary for construction of new pond
 talab nirmaan ke liye mitti kii jal dhaaran kshamta va urvarakta ko chayan kaa aadhaar mana janaa chahie
 Ponds should not be built on the barren and wastelands
 jis mitti main amleeyta va kshariyata adhik ho us par bhi talab nirmit karaayaa janaa uchit nahin hota he
 Apart from this, the construction of a pond is not appropriate even in the soil soils because the water does not stop in the loamy ponds

 parinamswaroop machhlee kaa prakritik bhojan utpann hona ruuk jaataa he or prakritik bhojan ke abhaav main machhlee kii vruddhi par vipareet prabhaav padataa he
 Apart from this, these plants increase their potency by polluting the chemical substances found in the soil and the nutritional value of water is reduced
 machhlee pakadaney ke liye yadi jaal chalaaya jaay tab bhi yah paudhe rukawat daalate hai
 Generally, there are three types of aquatic plants in ponds - one with water surface such as hyacinth, lemna etc
, second root-like lotus etc
 and third water-immersed like hydrilla, najaj etc
 yadi talab main jaleey paudhon kii maatra kam ho to inhen jaal chalaakar yaa shramik lagaakar jad se ukhadkar nikaala ja saktaa he
 In case of excess aquatic vegetation, use of chemicals such as 2-4 d sodium salts, teficide, hexamar and Fernaxan in 8-10 kg per hectare of water area, water hyacinth, lotus etc
 are destroyed
 rasayanon ke prayog ke samay vishesh jaankaree matsay vibhaag ke karyaalayon se praapt kii jaani chahie
 Some submerged plants are the favorite food of grass carp fish, so they can be prevented by grasping grapes in the pond
 upyukt yahi he ki anaavashyak paudhon kaa unmoolan maanav-shakti se hi sunishchit kiya jaay
 In the old ponds many unnecessary animals like turtles, frogs, crabs and fishes like Sindhri, Puthiya, Chelwa etc
 and eater fishes are found for example Pichin, Tangen, Saul, Girai, Singhi, Mangur etc
 which are available to feed the food available in the pond
 Receive as food
 maansaahaari machhliyaan carp machhliyon ke bacchon ko kha jaati he jisase matsay paalan par vipareet prabhaav padataa he
 Therefore, their cleanliness is absolutely necessary
 avaanchhneeya machhliyon kaa nishkasana baar-baar jaal chalaakar yaa pani nikaal kar athwa mahua kii khali ke prayog dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 Mahu cake should be used in a pond with a depth of one meter of water in one hectare area at the rate of 25 quintals
 iske parinaam swaroop 6-8 ghanton main sari machhliyaan mar kar upar aa jaati hai jinhen jaal chalaakar ekatra karke bazaar main bechaa ja saktaa he

 gobar kii khaad, matsay beej sanchay se 15-20 din purv saamaanthya 10-20 ton prati he0 prati varsh 10 samaan masik kishton main prayog kii jaani chahie
 If the mahua cake has been poured in the preparation of the pond for the removal of undesirable fish, then there is no need to put the first installment of cow dung
 saamanyat: rasinic khaadon main uria 200 kilogram, singil super phosphate 250 ki0gra0 va murat of potash 40 ki0gra0 arthath kul mishran 490 ki0gra0 prati he0 prati varsh 10 samaan masik kishton main prayog kiya janaa chahie
 In this way, a mixture of chemical fertilizer of 49 kg per hectare per month should be put in the pond after 15 days of use of cow dung
 yadi talab ke pani kaa rang gaharaa haraa yaa gaharaa nila ho jaye to urvarkon kaa prayog tab tak band kar dena chahie jab tak pani kaa rang uchit avasthaa main na aa jaye
 Accumulation of pure seeds of such good fish species in the pond should be ensured that, while staying in the same aquatic environment, do not harm each other and consume the food available on different surfaces of the pond and grow rapidly
 bhartiya major carp machhliyon main katala, rohu evam nain tathaa videshi carp machhliyon main silver carp, grass carp evam kaaman carp kaa mishrit paalan vishesh laabhakaari hota he
 Pure seed of the best fish species is a basic requirement of fisheries

 Special emphasis is being given on the privatization of fish seed production with the objective of making Uttar Pradesh self-sufficient in the field of fish seed production and up to Rs 8
00 lakh for setting up a mini fish seed hatchery with a capacity of 10 million in the private sector
 Facility of loan and 10 percent government grant is permissible
 matsay paalak nijee kshetron main sthapit chote aakaar kii hechariyon se bhi shuddh beej praapt kar sakate hai
 Such fish species should be reared in the pond, which will grow rapidly by using the food available on each surface without harming each other by living together in an environment so that maximum fish production from a confined water area To be sure bhartiya major carp machhliyon main katala, rohu, nain tathaa videshi carp machhliyon main silver carp, grass carp va kaaman carp kaa mishrit paalan kaaphi laabhakaari hota he
 Before storing fish seed in the pond, it is worth noting that preparations have been completed and organic production has been done
 machhlee kaa prakritik bhojan jise planctan kehete hai paryaapt maatra main uplabdh hona chahie
 The availability of one milliliter of plant in 50 liters of water in the pond indicates that fish seed can be stored
 ek he0 jal kshetra main 50 mi0me0 aakaar se kam kaa 10,000 matsay beej tathaa 50 mi0me0 se adhik aakaar kii 5000 angulikaayen sanchit kii jaani chahie
 If six types of domestic and foreign carp fishes are being mixed, then the ratio of katla 20 percent silver carp 10 percent, rohu 30 percent, grass carp 10 percent, nan 15 percent and common carp 15 percent is appropriate
 yadi silver carp va grass carp machhliyon kaa paalan nahin kiya ja rahaa he or 4 prakaar kii machhliyaan paali ja rahi hai to sanchay anupaat katala 40 pratishat, rohu 30 pratishat, nain 15 pratishat va kaaman carp 15 pratishat hona laabhakaari hota he
 If only Indian major carp fishes are being reared then the ratio of katla 40 percent, rohu 30 percent, nan 30 percent should be
 kaaman carp machhlee kaa beej march, april va may main tathaa anya carp machhliyon kaa beej july, agast, sitambar main praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 For high yields of fish, it is absolutely necessary to have suitable soil and water in the pond
 aisi mitti jisamen sand 40 pratishat tak, silt 30 pratishat tathaa clay 30 pratishat ho evam pi-ech 6
5 se 7
5 ho, matsay paalan hetu talab nirmaan ke liye upyukt hoti he
 When the percentage of sand in the soil is high, there is a problem of water in the pond
 adhik kshareey mrudaa bhi matsay paalan hetu upyukt nahin hoti he
 The soil of the pond should contain 50 mg of nitrogen and 6 mg of phosphorus per 100 grams of soil and one percent organic carbon
 yadi uplabdh nitrogen, phosphorus evam argenic carbon saamaanya se kam he to nirdhaarit matraaon main jaivik va rasaynic urvarkon kaa prayog karte hue talab ko matsay paalan hetu upyukt banaaya ja saktaa he
 The color of the water of the pond is light brown because the natural food plantation of fish is available in this type of water

 Computing means a feed aggregator, called a feed reader, news reader, or aggregator, is a desktop or web application that compiles syndicated drafts, such as news headlines, blogs, podcasts, and blogs, all in one place, on the Internet
 Displays it
 chunki is saamagree main badlaav yaa adhyatan hota rahata hai atah sankalak yani agrigater ko lagaatar masaude kii kshamal feed par nazar rakhni padati he
 In this article the word compiler is used for aggregator, but keep in mind that it is not a standard term
 jis sindicated masaude ko sankalak grahan karata he vah saamanytah aresas yaa anya kisi kshamal praaroop jaise ardf yaa atom main muhaiyaa karaayaa jaataa he
 The compiler saves the time and labor spent on locating new content on websites, and in a way makes it a personal newspaper for the reader to present
 ek baar kisi feed ko sabsakraib karne yaa niyamit pathak ban jane par sankalak prayogkarta kii icchaanusaar tay antaraal par nai saamagree kaa pataa lagaakar us tak saamagree pahunchaa detaa he
 This technique is called bridge technology
 yah email yaa instent miseging jaise sadhano main prayukt push taknalaji se thik ulat yukti he
 Also, with push technology, the compiler can easily unsubscribe from any feed as compared to the subscribers of the content, ie it can refuse to be a reader
 zyaadaatar sankalak prayokta ko uske yaa anya pathakon dwaara padhe ja rahe feed kii suchi opiemail praaroop main niryaat va aayaat karne kii suvidha bhi dete hai
 In many portal web sites, compilation is available on the website itself, such as My Yahoo or i Google
 yah suvidha aadhunik web brouzaron va email kaaryakramon par bhi uplabdh he
 The compiler encapsulates the draft and serves it on a single browser or desktop application
 in anuprayogon ko aresas reader, feed reader, feed agrigater, news reader yaa search agrigater bhi kaha jaataa he
 Compilers that have the capability of podcasting can also automatically download or download media files such as MP3 recording
 kuch maamalon main to ye in filon ko computer se jude ypod jaise portable media playeron main sidhe lod bhi kar saktaa he
 Recently some new compilers, also being called "RSS Narrator", have also come in the field which not only compile feed drafts but also allow them to listen as audio recording without being connected to internet
 jaal aadhaarit sankalak aise anuprayog hai jo duurastha sarwar par sthit hote hai or jinka google reader yaa blogalins jaise jaal anuprayogon ke sahare prayog kiya jaataa he
 Since these applications are used through the Internet, the user can read their subscribed feeds wherever Internet connectivity is available
 aadhunik sankalak ajaiks jaisi takneekon kaa prayog karte hai or anekon vijet ke rup main bhi uplabdh hai
 In addition to individual compilers, there are community compilers that usually compile feeds from a small community

 Examples: In sepan, etc
 media sankalak, jinhen podcast kii lokapriyata ke kaaran podcachar bhi pukaara jaataa he, aisi feed ke sankalak hote hai jinamein masauda mukhyatah audio yaa video ho
 These are added to the feed as ye jaal yaa desktop aadhaarit anuprayog ho sakate hai
 They can download and play media or synchronize with an external media player like ipod
 sankalkon ke saath saamagree kii atishyata ek moolbhoot samasya he, khaas taur par yadi prayokta anekon feed kaa pathak ho
 Compilers deal with this problem differently
