 raajakmal prakaashan The time between the two yugas is known as Sandhi Kaal or Yuga Sandhi
 The article presented here indicates the time between Kali Yuga and Sati Yuga

 On days when the prevalence or influence is prevalent, it is called by the same name

 The meaning of the word era is from here

 Yugas are counted in many ways

 Almost every millennium, the atmosphere changes, there is notable manipulation of traditions
 beesvin sadi ke ant or ikkisvin sadi ke prarambh ko ek yug kaa samaapan or duusare kaa shubharambh mana gaya he
 Similarly, in Panchangas, there is a discussion of the beliefs related to the beginning of many promoters
 ek mat ke anusaar yug karodon varsh kaa hota he
 On this basis, trillions of years have passed since the beginning of human civilization and there is a delay of millions of years in the end of the present Kali Yuga

 Thus, at the beginning and end of the Krit Yuga, each and every four hundred years is three hundred years on each side, in front of and behind the Treta Yuga, two hundred years on each side before and after Dvapar, and in every compound, all four ages etc
 The evening period with the end is two thousand years, and the evening with the end is two thousand years
 ye do hajaar varsh or pehle bataaye hue sankhya matanusaar chaaron yugon ke das hajaar varsh milakar kul baarah hajaar varsh yugon ke das hajaar varsh milakar kul baarah hajaar varsh hote he

 In the Kalki Purana, there is a description of the twelve kalpas of the Savan Manu of the Daksha, Brahma, Rudra Dev and Indra Savanis, the incarnation and the beginning of Satyuga ending the Kali Yuga in the earth
 sawanmanu kaa aavirbhaav vikrami samvat prarambh hone se 5730 varsh purv hua tha
 It is written that Kalki appears and Kalki Samvat prevails only after the incarnation of Indra Savannas, which starts from the birth of Kalki and its period is found around the year 4970

 The discrepancy is virtually due to the mistake of presentation when calculating time
 granthon main jo yug gananaa bataayi gai he, usamen surya paribhraman kaal ko chaar bade khandon main vibhakt kar chaar dev yugon kaa kalpana kii gai he
 a Deva Yuga is said to be 4,32,000 years old
 is aadhaar par dhamrgranthon main varnait kalikaal kii samaapti kii sangati prastut samay se thik-thik baith jaati he
 It is possible that in the event of a contradiction, people cannot easily believe in this time calculation, here, 'yuga' has been interpreted as having a specific time
 yug nirmaan yojana aandolan apane andar yahi bhav chipaaye hue he
 Time is going to change, it has a clear tableau
 prayek sandhi kaa apana vishesh mahatv hota he
 The time of sunrise and sunset is called Samadhikaal

 Those who believe in spiritual practice consider the special importance of worship in both these times

 Winter and summer are the nine nights of Ashwin and Chaitra at the union of these two principal seasons

 During this period, sadhak gana performs special practices

 There is excitement in everyone in that veela
 phool khilte hai, pakshi chahachahate hai or sabhi praani apane-apane kaaryon main vishesh utsaah ke saath lag padate hai
 The new millennium should be considered the same
 ikksivin sadi bhi aise hi shubh sandesh saath lekar aa rahi he
 a bright future should be conceived and recognized in relation to it
 kaliyug kii samaapti or satyuga kii shuruyaat ke sambandh main aam dharna he ki san 1989 main 2001 tak ke baarah varshon kaa samay sandhikaal ke rup main hona chahie
 In this, both the process of human effortless development and destruction due to nature inspiration should be done in every field in its own way
 baarah varsh kaa samay vyaavhaarik yug bhi kehalaata he
 If the Yuga Samdhikal is considered as such, then there will be no exaggeration in it
 har baarah varsh ke interval main ek nayaa parivartan aata he, chaahe vah manushya ho, vriksh, vanaspati athwa vishwa brahmand sabhi main yah parivartan parilakshith hota he
 Almost all the cells of the human body change themselves every twelve years, so the gross vision cannot be perceived but it is science-agreed

 The twelve-year exile of the Pandavas is well known
 tapashchaya or praayshchit parimarjan ke bahumoolya prayog bhi baarah varsh kii avadhi kii mahatta or vishistataa ko hi darshaate hai
 On this basis, if the current twelve years are considered to be a stormy settlement, then there is no such thing as discrepancy
 kuch rudhivaadee panditon kaa kathan he ki yug 4 lakh 32 hajaar varsh kaa hota he
 According to this, there is a delay of 3 lakh 24 thousand years in the arrival of a new era
 vartmaan samay main esa bilkul bhi upyukt nahin lagata |vastav main shastreey pratipaadan har jagah vishisht arth rakhte hai, unhen ulta-pulta joda gaya, usee ke kaaran andh manyatayen faili
 The rendering is not wrong, but the presentation is misleading, it should be understood and resolved

 Similarly, according to the calculations of the Moon, there is a great difference in the duration of the era
 vaigyanikon ne khoj kii he ki 11 varsh main surya kii antardasha badalati he, is 12 varsh kii hi uskaa ek yug kaha ja saktaa he
 Where each era of 4 lakh 32 thousand years has been envisaged, its association does not sit in any way from the age-calculation of the scriptures

 jyotishi medhatithi ne sochaa hoga ki kaliyug to mujh tak hi kai hajaar varsho kaa vyateet ho chukaa he, phir yah 1200 varsho kaa nahin ho saktaa
 Then he must have seen this 34th verse of the 12, chapter 2 of Srimad Bhagwat
 divyabdanan sahasrante chatuthertu punah kritam
 The future is always mindless self-publisher iskaa shabdaarth yah he ki- 'chaar hajaar divya vashon ke ant main arthath chaar hajaar divya varsho main ' phir satyuga aayegaa jo manushyon ke man or aatma main prakaash karegaa
 The divine word has appeared in this verse
 medhatithi ne iskaa arth devtaa kar daalaa or abhi tak praayah sabhi pandit log aisa hi arth karte rahe hai
 Since the deity is equal to one day of a man's year, considering that Medhatithi mistakenly considered 1200 years to be Kali Yuga, multiplying them by 360 years to be 432000, and writing such a period of Kali Yuga which is completely false
 'divya' shabd kaa arth devtaa nahin ho saktaa
 Rigveda 2 is the proof of this

 The derivation of divine power has been done there - 'divya Divijo' which means that which appears in Divi, it is called Divya

 There are 12 names of the day written in the Nagantuk scandal, among them the word Duy also signifies the day, now the divine meaning is 'that which appears in the day'

 The divine name in the Veda is that of the sun, the deity is not called divine

 Even from grammar, the word divine does not mean deity
 div dhaatu main 'swaartheyat' pratyay lagane se divya shabd banataa he
 Its derivation is - 'diva Bhavana Divyaan' which means that appears in Divi

 Divi is called Dyu and Diu is the name of the day

 'that is, all four ages belong to humans, there is an age of gods equal to them
 isliye satyuga 4800 varsho kaa or kaliyug 1200 varsho kaa hi hua
 Medhatithi has written the four ages as the age of the gods and their years as the year of the gods, which Kulluk Bhatt has contradicted 500 years ago
 vastav main surya kii uttar dakshin gati ko hi divya varsh kehete hai, jisaki gati 360 sankhya kii he, arthath uttarayan ke 6 maas or dakshinyan ke 6 maas ke 360 din-raat manushyon ke hue
 This is called the divine year
 atah divya devataaon kaa varsh nahin he
 Therefore, those who have come from 360 to 1200 multiplied earlier, so the age of Kali Yuga was only 1200 years old

 He sent a message through him that if Shivaji accepts the subjugation of Bijapur, the Sultan will give him the right to all the areas which are under Shivaji's control
 saath hi shivaji ko bijapur ke darbar main ek sammanit pad praapt hoga
 Though Shivaji's minister and advisor was in favor of As Sandhi, Shivaji did not like these talks
 unhone krishnaji bhaskar ko uchit sammaan dekar apane darbar main rakh liya or apane doot gopinath ko vastusthiti kaa jayja lene afjal khan ke paas bheja
 From Gopinath and Krishnaji Bhaskar, Shivaji felt that Afzal Khan wanted to imprison Shivaji by plotting a treaty

 Shivaji was in trouble, but taking advantage of the darkness of the night, he managed to escape

 At the same time, due to the revolt of Siddijauhar in Karnataka, the Sultan of Bijapur entered into an agreement with Shivaji
 is sandhi main shivaji ke pita shahji ne madhyasthata kaa kaam kiya
 According to this treaty in 1662, Shivaji was recognized as an independent ruler by the Sultan of Bijapur

 Shivaji looted the wealthy merchants of Surat for six days in 1664 with an army of four thousand

 june 1665 main hui is sandhi ke mutabik shivaji 23 durg mughalon ko de denge or is tarah unke paas keval 12 durg batch jaayenge
 The income from these 23 fortifications was 4 lakh Huns annually

 Apart from this, they will also give revenue of 5 lakh Huns every year

 Shivaji will support the Mughals against Bijapur

 Against this, he showed his fury in the court and accused Aurangzeb of betrayal
 aurangzeb isse kshubdh hua or usne shivaji ko nazarkaid kar diya or unpar 5000 sainikon ke pehre laga diye
 Aurangzeb intended to kill King Shivaji a few days later

 After the establishment of an independent Hindu nation in western Maharashtra, Shivaji wanted to crown his coronation, but Muslim soldiers threatened the Brahmins that whoever crowned Shivaji would be killed
 When this thing reached Shivaji that the Mughal Sardar is making such threats, then Shivaji took it as a challenge and said that now he will get anointed from the Brahmin of that state who is in the authority of the Mughals
 Shivaji's personal secretary Balaji sent three emissaries to Kashi, because Kashi was under the Mughal Empire
 When the messengers gave the message, the Brahmins of Kashi were quite pleased
 But the Mughal soldiers came to know about this and then caught those Brahmins
 But wisely those Brahmins told those messengers in front of the Mughal sannyko that we do not know who Shivaji is
 What line are they from? The messengers did not know that is why they said we do not know
 Then in front of the Sardar of the Mughal soldiers, those Brahmins said that we have to go somewhere else, from which clan Shivaji you have not told, so how can we crown him
 We are going on a pilgrimage and no other Brahmin will get the coronation until Kashika is fully introduced, so you can go back
 The Mughal Sardar was happy and left the Brahmins and thought of catching the messengers and sending them to Aurangzeb to Delhi, they too escaped silently
 After returning, he told this thing to Balaji Awa and Shivaji
 But surprisingly after two days the same Brahmin reached Raigad with his disciples and crowned Shivaji
 We are going on a pilgrimage and no other Brahmin will get the coronation until Kashika is fully introduced, so you can go back

 Seeing the demise of Aurangzeb King Shivaji at that time, with the desire to rule his whole India, he went out to conquer South India with his 500,000 army
 aurangzeb ne dakshin main atehi adilshaahi 2 dino main ore qutubashhi 1 hi dino main khatam kar di
 But the Marathas, under the leadership of King Sambhaji, maintained their independence while fighting for 9 years
 aurangzeb ke putr shahjada akbar ne aurangzeb ke kilaaf vidroh kar diya
 Sambhaji gave him shelter in his place
 aurangzeb ne ab phir joardaar tareeke se sambhaji ke kilaaf akraman karnaa shuru kiya
 Finally, in 1689, Sambhaji's wife's brother, Sambhaji, by the mouth of Ganji Shirke, made Sambhaji a prisoner by Mukarav Khan
 aurangzeb ne raja sambhaji se badasluki kii or bura haal kar ke maar diya
 Seeing his king being mistreated by Aurangzeb and badly hit, the Pura Maratha Swarajya became angry

 Rajaram died in 1700 AD

 The weak range of orally active phenoxyethylphenicillin with a narrow range of curable diseases or the spectrum of activity of penicillin led to the discovery of a homologous form of penicillin, to treat a wider range of infections
 6-apie ke algaav, penicillin ke centre ne benzilpenicillin main vibhinn sudhaaron ke saath semisynthetic penicillinon ko taiyaar karne kii anumati di
 The first major development was ampicillin, which provided a wider range of activities than all the original penicillins
 Further development led to the production of beta-lactamase-resistant penicillin, including flucloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and methicillin
 ye sabhi beta-lactamez-bacteria prajatiyon ke viruddh unki gatividhiyon ke liye mahatvapurn thi, lekin methicilin-pratirodhi stefilococus orius ke prati aprabhavi thi, jo baad main paidaa hui
 In fact, another development of the line of penicillins was antisudomonal penicillin, a drug useful for its activities against gram-negative bacteria like carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and piperacillin

 β-lactam antibiotic works by inhibiting the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall
 penicillin kaa β-lactem moity anzime -transpapatides) se baandh detaa he, jo jeevanuon ke paptidoglaiken anuon se judata he, jisase bacterium kii koshika diwaar kamazor ho jaati he iske alaava paptidoglaiken pricursor jeevanugat koshika kii diwaar ke hydrolysis evam autolicins kii sakriyata ko or badhaata he, jo aage chal kar bacteria ke maujuuda paptidoglaiken ko pachaata he
 Gram-positive bacteria, when they lose their cell walls, are called protoplasts
 gram-negative jeevanu apni koshika diwaar purnatah nahin khote evam penicillin se ilaaj ke baad unhen spheroplast kaha jaataa he
 Penicillin shows a synergistic effect with aminoglycosides, because inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis allows the aminoglycosides to more easily penetrate the bacterial cell wall, facilitating the disruption of bacterial protein synthesis within the cell itself
 iske parinamswaroop atisamvedansheel andrik rachana ke liye embisi kaa str kam ho jaataa he
 Like other β-lactam antibiotics, penicillin blocks not only the part of cyanobacteria, parts of the vulcan cyanel, the photosynthetic cell membrane of glucophytes, and the chloroplast part of the bryophytes

 There is a small village called Ansuiya here where there is a grand temple
 mandir nagar style main bana he
 It is said that when Atri Muni was doing penance just a few distance from here, his wife Ansuiya made his abode at this place following Pativrat Dharma
 kavindati he ki devi anasuia kii mahima jab teenon lokon main gaae jane lagi to anasuia ke pativrat dharm kii pariksha lene ke liye parvati, lakshmi or saraswati ne brahma, vishnu or mahesh ko vivash kar diya
 According to the legend, then, these trudevi Goddess Anasuiya reach the ashram in the monk to take the test and she expressed her desire for food
 lekin unhone anusuia ke saamne pan rakhaa ki vah unhen god main baitaakar upar se nirvastr hokar aalingan ke saath bhojan karaayengi
 Anasuya got confused on this
 unhone ankhen band apane pati kaa samaran kiya to saamne khadey saadhuon ke rup main unhen brahma, vishnu or mahesh khadey dikhalaai die
 Anusuiya remembered her husband in her own mind and these trinity became six months old
 tab mata anasuia ne tridevon ko unke pan ke anuroop hi bhojan karaayaa
 In this way, Tridev began to enjoy childhood
 udhar teenon deviyaan patiyon ke viyog main dukhi ho gai
 Then at the behest of Narada Muni, she started praying to Anasuiya to bring her husbands in the original form
 apane satitv ke bal par anasuia ne teenon devon ko phir se purv main laa diya
 Since then, she became famous as Mother Sati Ansuiya

 grearsan ne aadhunik bhartiya aryabhashaon kaa vargeekaran karte samay pahari bhashaaon kaa ek swatantra samudaay mana he
 Chatterjee has declared them to be based on Paishachi, Darad or Khas Prakrit and the influence of Prakrit and Apabhramsa languages of Rajasthan in Madrika
 ek naveen mat ke anusaar kam se kam madhya pahari bhashaaon kaa udgam shauraseni praakrit he, jo rajasthani kaa mul bhi he
 The phonology of the Pahari languages, sound group, grammar, etc
 have been imprinted on many ethnic levels
 yaksha, kinnar, kiraat, naag, khas, shaq, arya aadi vibhinn jatiyon kii bhashaagat visheshtaayen praytn karne par khoji ja sakati hai jinamein ab yahan arya-aryetar tatv paraspar ghul mil gaye hai
 Historically it is known that in ancient times, some of their different forms were mostly oral
 madhyakaal main yah bhubhag rajasthani bhashaa bhashiyon ke adhik sampark main aayaa or aadhunik kaal main avaagaman kii suvidha ke kaaran hindi bhashaai tatv yahan pravesh karte ja rahe hai
 In a way the behavior of Pahari languages has become limited to domestic colloquialism, correspondence etc
 pahari bhashaaon main darad bhashaaon kii kuch dhvanyatmak visheshtaayen milti hai jaise ghosh mahapraan ke sthaan par aghosh alpapraan dhwani ho janaa
 The name of the western and central hill region was in the ancient times the editorlaksha
 yahan madhyakaal main gurjaron evam anya rajput logon kaa avaagaman hota rahaa jiskaa mukhya kaaran musalamaani akraman tha
 Therefore, in local languages, most of the "n" is targeted instead of "n" and the incipient tendency of non-intransitive words is a sign of Rajasthani influence
 purvi hindi ko bhi ekaadhik pravritiyaan madhya pahari bhashaaon main vidyaman hai kyonki yahan kaa katyur rajvansh suryavanshi ayodhya nareshon se sambandh rakhata tha
 On this basis, the relation of the Pahari languages with the semi-magadhi-kshetra also becomes clear
 inke vartmaan swaroop par vichaar karte hue do tatv mukhyat: saamne aate hai
 One is that they have different characteristics of Pahari languages from Hindi language
 duusare kuch tatv donon ke samaan hai
 Somewhere Hindi words are used alternatively with local words and elsewhere Hindi words are taking the place of local words
 khadi boli ke madhyam se kuch videshi shabd, jaise "hajaamat", "aspataal", "feeta", "sip", "dagdar" aadi bhi chal pade hai
 Three distinctions of Pahari languages can be determined: ise nepali athwa "khaskura" bhi kehete hai
 "gorkhali" is under this
 isamen likhit sahitya paryaapt he
 They are spoken in Kumaon and Garhwal, hence the names "kumaoni" and "garhwali" are famous on this basis
 uttar pradesh ke saat parvaty jile inke kshetra hai or inhen bolanewaalon kii sankhya lagbhag 16 lakh he
 The Kumaoni language is used in the districts of Nainital, Almora and Pithoragarh
 iskaa kshetra is samay lagbhag 8000 vargamil main vistrut he tathaa san 1951 kii janaganana ke anusaar ise bolanewaalon kii sankhya lagbhag 570,008 he
 Hindi is used as a second language
 is kaaran kumaunni hindi khadi boli ke atyadhik nikat aa gai he
 Grammatically, pronouns - I, you, we, you, u, u, are used
 sambandh kaarak bahuvachan kaa rup "unako" na hokar "unar" hota he
 Like in Hindi, only two genders are used in Kumaoni and this sexuality is not only based on the distinction of masculinity, femininity, but also on the size and nature of the object
 vachan do hai, tathaa hindi kii praaia: sabhi dhaatuen milti hai
 Gradation, and syntax are also similar
 aarambh main karta ant main kriyaapad rahata he
 Adverb also comes before the verb like in Hindi
 phir bhi kumaunni main kuch dhvaniyaan khadi boli hindi kii apeksha vishisht hai
 From the point of view of the vowels, the sounds Hrasva "aa", Harsva "A", Harsva "ae", Harsva "O" and Harsva "au" can be seen
 is bhed se shabdaarthon kaa antar ho gaya he
 For example, the word "kawan" means in Kumaoni - the word "kala" and "kava" means "kaal" - meaning death
 vyanjanon main vishesh "na" tathaa vishesh "l" kii uplabdhi hoti he
 Words like "kan", "bhanan" have a distinctive "no" sound which is pronounced towards certain rhythms
 vishesh "l" varna gangoli tathaa kaali kumaun kii boliyon main praapt hoti he
 There are eight dialects of Kumaoni - Khasrajia, Kumayyan, Pachai, Danpuria, Soormali, Sherali, Gangola, Bhotia
 kumaunni bhashaa kii lipi devanagari he
 Its oral literature is very rich, although written literature is also no less important
 gadhwali bhashaa main abhi pracheen tatv kumaunni kii apeksha surakshit hai
 It is practiced in district Garhwal, Tehri, Chamoli and Uttar Kashi
 yah kshetra lagbhag 10,000 vargamil he tathaa gadhwali bhashaa bhashiyon kii sankhya lagbhag 10 lakh
 There are traffic difficulties due to geographical reasons
 isliye pahadiyo ke donon ore rahanewaalon athwa ek hi nadi ke aarpaar rahanewaalon ke bhashaagat prayogon main visheshtaayen ubhar ai hai
 Tibetan in the dialects of the north, and the Kumauni influence towards the east is evident because the boundaries of these areas are mixed
 rajput jatiyon kaa nivas hone ke kaaran gadhwali par najasthani prabhaav to he hi, iske dakshin-pashchim kii ore khadi boli bhi apana prabhaav daalati ja rahi he
 Some characteristics of Garhwali language are visual
 iskaa jhukaav dirghatv kii ore he at: swaron main e, i, o, ou, kii dhvaniyaan, jinka deergh rup pradhan he, adhik prayukt hoti hai
 The tendencies of resonance are relatively low
 kuch aise shabd milte hai jo pracheen bhashaaon se chale aae hai jaise "mukh" ke arth main "gichcho" shabd
 It is possible that many of the received words are remnants of the oldest castes
 vyakaran kii drushti se gadhwali main ek dantagra "l" dhwani pai jaati he jo anyatra kahin nahin milti
 In verb forms, "o" or "ava" is added by omitting the final "a" of the metal, such as running
 lingabhed bhi pray: niyamit nahin
 Much attention is given to the shortness of things, gravity
 anek shabdon ke ekvachan, bahuvachan rup samaan chalate hai
 The characteristics of the idols "L" and "N" in the pronunciation are visual
 sthanbhed se gadhwali kii nau pramukh boliyaan hai - srinagariy, salaani, manjhkumaiyaan, gangavariy, badhaani, rathi, dasauliya, lobhiya or rarvalty
 The main difference seems to be the pronunciation
 gadhwali bhashaa kaa bhi maukhik sahitya mahatv rakhata he
 This is the third distinction of Pahari languages
 vastut: yah anek boliyon kaa samuhik naam he
 These dialects are spoken in Jonsar Bawar, Shimla, north-east-frontier Punjab, Kullu Valley, Chamba etc
 in sabhi boliyon kaa sahitya likhit rup main praapt nahin, is kaaran bhashaa vaigyanik khoj bahut kam ho pai he
 Till now the bids that can be fixed under this, their area is about 14 thousand square miles and the number of ballers is usually 16 lakhs
 inamen mukhya hai - sirmauri, jonsari, kului, champali, andiyaali or bhadravahee, aadi
 Most of the folklore and stories are popular in these dialects
 kului tathaa chambali par idhar kuch kaary hua he
 The region of Kului is, most likely, the area of the ancient Kunind waters that ruled here
 is samay yah boli kullu ghati se lekar himachal pradesh ke mahasu jile tak boli jaati he
 Champali is notable for its melodiousness and due to location differences it also gets "bhatiali", "churahi", etc
 variations
 mandiyaali suket main boli jaati he jabaki badhati solan kii ore
 There is a behavior of Quthali in the foursome of Shimla
 pehle pashchimi pahari kii ye sabhi boliyaan takkari lipi main likhi jaati thim kintu ab devanagari kaa prayog hota he
 Baharampur Lok Sabha constituency is a Lok Sabha constituency in the state of West Bengal, India
 janata hawaldaar 1979 main bani hindi bhashaa kii film he
 Vanua Levu is the second largest island in Fiji country in the Pacific Ocean
 iskaa kshetrafal 5,587
1 varg kimi he, jo bharat ke goa or sikkim rajyon ke lagbhag bich kaa aankada he
 It is located about 64 km northeast of the country's largest island, Viti Levu
 2910 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year 2910 BCE or the year before his birth is represented as the basis of Jesus' birth
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 2910 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kaliyuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc
 remo bhashaa bharat kii sankatagrast bhashaaon main se ek he
 It is seriously under threat
