is siddhanth ke anusaar jothode se shabdon kaa samaadhaan ho paata he unka bhashaa main koi vishesh mahatva nahin he
 For example, to express regret or sympathy, the form of 'ch-ch', 'ta-ta' etc
 is doubtful, so it cannot be made the basis of any study or analysis
 hindi main ise ‘shrampariharanmulakatawaad’ kaha jaataa he
 This theory was formulated by a famous scholar named Navare
 is siddhanth ke anusaar jab vyakti shram karata he to uski shwaas kii gati teevr hone se swartantriyon main swatah ek compann hone lagata he jo kuch swaabhaavik dhvaniyon ko utpann karata he
 When human beings used to do collective labor, there would be some sounds coming out of their mouths like 'hio-hio', 'chiyo-chiyo' from the mouth of Dhobis, and 'haiya Ho' from the mouth of the seafarers, the mouth of the hammer worker
 i often see the sounds of 'am-am' coming out
 angrezi ke ‘hiv’ tathaa ‘haul’ ‘yo-he-ho’ dhvaniyon ke dwaara bani hui kriyaapad hai
 Analysis is siddhanth main nimnlikhit trutiyaan hai- The conclusion is siddhanth ke aadhaar par bane shabdon se bhashaa kii utpatti kii samasya kaa samaadhaan praapt nahin hota
 Eminent sociologist, English lawyer A
 s
 Diamond did not find a single word in an ancient language 'oar' which is based on this principle
 atah aisi bhashaaon ke sambandh main to yah siddhanth puri tarah se vifal he
 The believers of this theory are Dr
 Raye, 'richard' and Jehansen
 is siddhanth ke anusaar manushya jab pani peetaa tha to ‘paa-paa’ jaisi dhwani nikaalati thi
 Which made words like 'pipasa'
 samiksha It does not seem more reliable that a human would pronounce his own sounds
 nishkarsh These sounds are very small in terms of origin of the whole language
 inase bhashaa-utpatti kii samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hota
 The famous scholar G
 Ravage is its parent
 is siddhanth ke anusaar aadim maanav jab samooh ke sampark main aayaa hoga to pehle kuch dhvaniyaan uske munh se nikali hogi or kalantar main shabd or phir bhashaa kaa janm hua ho
 According to these scholars, verb words will be formed in the first language and later other words samiksha On the basis of psychology, there seems to be some facts in this theory, but only through these words the solution of the origin of the whole language is not resolved
 is siddhanth main kalpana or anumaan kaa sahaara liya gaya he
 The conclusion is siddhanth ko bhi ham bhashaa kii utpatti yaa vikaas main aanshik mahatva hi de sakate hai
 Even the famous scholar, Cassidy, considers this theory incomplete
 upar ullikhit adhikansh siddhanth bhashaa kii utpatti kii samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin kar pate hai isi kaaran vidwaanon ne un teen-chaar siddhanton kaa samanvay karke is samasya kaa samaadhaan paane kii cheshtaa kii he jinamein aanshik samaadhaan kii maatra adhik he
 Thus an attempt to find a solution to this problem seems justified
 prasiddh vidvan henry sweet ne yahi kaary kiya he
 By not discovering any new theory, he has presented only a coordinated form of 'simulation theory', impulse theory, 'symbol theory' and 'treatment-theory'
 yahan anukaran siddhanth ke antargat anuranan siddhanth ko bhi samanvit samajhnaa chahie kyonki dhvaniyon kaa anukaran donon main samaan rup se rahata he
 The position of impulsive words in the language must also have been there, because similar words appear in all languages
 uparyukt donon prakaar ke shabdon ke atirikt ‘pratik siddhanth’ dwaara bhi ham is samasya kaa samaadhaan paa sakate hai
 Initially, the gross, objective form of language comes into view, later it develops subtlety, semiotics and euphemism
 pehle bhashaa main kuch dhvaniyaan jo sthool aarthon main prayog kii jaati thim ve baad main sookshm arthon main kii jane lageen
 Thus language symbols developed as sound symbols
 ‘pratik siddhanth’ ke samaan hi upachaar-siddhanth ko bhi sammilit kar liya jaae to bhashaa main prayukt ek bade shabd samooh kaa samaadhaan ho jaataa he
 Treatment means the interpretation of the unknown based on the known
 bhashaa ko sthulata se sookshmata kii ore le jane main upachaar yaa saadrishy kii bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika rahati he
 His name is called 'natsi-natsi', based on the sound of flies buzzing in the 'sasuto' language of Southern Africa
 chaapluus vyakti jo chakkar katata rahata he uske liye bhi baad main ‘sasuton’ ‘ntsi-ntsi’ kehane lage
 In Sanskrit, 'vain' and 'kupa' metals first manifested the vibrations and motion of material substances, such as 'vyathamana earth' and 'kupitah paratvat' meaning 'trembling earth' and 'moving mountain'
 kaalaantar main manushyon ke bhaavon keliye ‘vyarth’ or ‘coup’ shabd kaa arth ‘maansik dukh’ tathaa ‘krodh’ ke liye kiya jane laga
 Analysis ‘sweet ke samanvay-siddhanth main yadhyapi paryaapt satya he kintu purnatah nirdoush ise bhi nahin mana ja saktaa kyonki bhashaa kii utpatti kii samasya kaa purnroopen samaadhaan is siddhanth ke dwaara bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The conclusion bhashaa kii utpatti ke sambandh main anek mat-siddhanth rache gaye parantu ve sab ke sab kalpana or anumaan par adhaarit hone ke kaaran bhashaa ke vaigyanik adhyayan kii drushti se mahatvaheen siddh ho chuke hai keval is prashn ke itihaas kii drushti se hi unka ullekh kiya jaataa he
 In fact, so far no universally accepted and appropriate solution to the question of the origin of language has been discovered
 france kii ‘bhashaa-vigyaan parishad’ ne apane kaaryakramon main bhashaa kii utpatti ke vichaar par sadaiv ke liye isi kaaran se pratibandh laga diya tha

 Electrons do not revolve around the nucleus in the sense of a planet orbiting the sun, but instead exist as standing waves

 Thomson speculates that many electrons revolve in orbit-like rings within a positively charged jelly-like substance, and between the discovery of the electron and 1909, this "plum pudding model" is the most widely accepted of the atomic structure Was the description

 Unlike the plum pudding model, the positive charge in Nagaoka's "saturnian model" was centered in a central core, pulling electrons in circular orbits reminiscent of Saturn's rings

 janm sthaan ke bare main vidwaanon main matbhed he parantu adhiktar vidwaan inkaa janm kaashi main hi maanate hai, jisaki pushti swayan kabir kaa yah kathan bhi karata he
 The prevailing statement regarding Kabir's Guru is that Kabir was looking for a suitable Guru
 vah vaishnav sant acharya ramanand ko apana apana guru bananaa chaahate the lekin unhone kabir ko shishy banane se manaa kar diya lekin kabir ne apane man main thaan liya ki swami ramanand ko hi har keemat par apana guru banaaungaa ,iske liye kabir ke man main ek vichaar aayaa ki swami ramanand ji subah chaar baje ganga snaan karne jate hai uske pehle hi unke jane ke maarg main sidhiyon let jaaounga or unhone aisa hi kiya
 One day, Kabir fell on the stairs of the Panchganga Ghat as soon as one night
 ramanand ji gangasnan karne ke liye seedhiyaan utar rahe the ki tabhi unka pair kabir ke sharir par pad gaya
 The word 'ram-ram' immediately came out of his mouth
 usee ram ko kabir ne diksha-mantra maan liya or ramanand ji ko apana guru sweekaar kar liya
 In Kabir's own words- jivicoparjan ke liye kabir julahe kaa kaam karte the
 Kabir had a strong belief that one gets his end in accordance with his deeds and not because of particular place
 apni is manyata ko siddh karne ke liye ant samay main vah magahar chale gaye ;kyonki logon manyata thi ki kaashi main marane par swarg or magahar main marane par narak miltaa he

 kabir ke ram to agam hai or sansar ke kan-kan main virajte hai
 Kabir's Ram is not even a monotheistic, monotheistic God of Islam
 islam main khuda yaa allaah ko samast jagat evam jeevon se bhinn evam param samarth mana jaataa he
 But Ram of Kabir may be supremely capable, but he is never different from all beings and the world
 balki iske vipareet ve to sabamein vyaapt rahane vaale ramata ram hai
 He says that the universal Brahman Sabnimayi I, will worship the Pandit
 ravan-raav kawnasuun kavan veda ko rogi
 Kabir does not imagine any special design of Rama, because Rama would be bound in a particular structure as soon as he imagined the design, which was not acceptable to Kabir under any circumstances
 kabir ram kii avadharana ko ek bhinn or vyapak swaroop dena chaahate the
 There were some specific reasons for this, which we will discuss further in this article
 kintu iske baavjood kabir ram ke saath ek vyaktigat paariwarik kism kaa sambandh jarur sthapit karte hai
 His love for Rama is distinguished by his supernatural and glorious power without forgetting even a single moment on the surface of a spontaneous romantic human relationship
 kabir naam main vishwaas rakhte hai, rup main nahin
 Although it is commonly distinguished in the principles of devotion-sensation that 'the name is greater than the form', Kabir made this general principle a revolutionary use
 kabir ne ram-naam ke saath lokmanas main shatabdiyon se rache-based sanshlisht bhaavon ko udaatt evam vyapak swaroop dekar use puraana-pratipaadit brahmanvaadi vichaardhaara ke khaanche main baandhe jane se rokane kii koshish kii
 Kabir's Ram is beyond the distinction of nirgun-saguna
 darasal unhone apane ram ko shaastra-pratipaadit avtari, sagun, varchaswashil varnashram vyavastha ke sangrakshak ram se alag karne ke liye hi ‘nirgun ram’ shabd kaa prayog kiya–‘nirgun ram japahu re bhai
 There is no need to get confused about this 'nirguna' word
 kabir kaa aashay is shabd se sirf itnaa he ki ishwar ko kisi naam, rup, gun, kaal aadi kii simaaon main bandha nahin ja saktaa
 Those who are beyond all limits and still everywhere, are Nirgun Rama of Kabir
 ise unhone ‘ramata ram’ naam diya he
 Despite giving his Nirguna adjective to Rama, Kabir talks of a kind of human love affair with him
 kabhi vah ram ko maadhurya bhav se apana premi yaa pati maan lete hai to kabhi daasya bhav se swami
 Sometimes he considers Rama as the mother of Vatsalya idol and himself as his son
 nirgun-niraakaar brahm ke saath bhi is tarah kaa saras, sahaj, maanviya prem kabir kii bhakthi kii vilakshantaa he
 This dilemma and problem may occur to others that how Ram, with whom Kabir is so unique, human relational, can be good, but it is not a problem for Kabir himself
 vah kehete bhi hai “santau, dhokhaa kaasuun kahiye
 Gunam i nirgun, nirgunam gun, baat chaandi kya bahis! profesar mahavir saran jain ne kabir ke ram evam kabir kii sadhana ke sambandh main apane vichaar vyakt karte hue kaha he : " kabir kaa sara jivan satya kii khoj tathaa asaty ke khandan main vyateet hua
 Kabir's cultivation begins by knowing "not obeying"
 ve kisi ke shishy nahin, ramanand dwaara chetaye hue chela hai
 For him, Rama is not a form, Dasharathi is not Rama, his Rama is a symbol of spiritual practice
 unke ram kisi sampradaay, jati yaa desh kii simaaon main kaid nahin he
 In the particle of nature, even in Ramana in the limb, which one cannot touch, he is Alakh, the imperishable, the supreme element Rama
 unke ram manushya or manushya ke bich kisi bhed-bhav ke kaarak nahin hai
 They are the symbols of the element of love
 bhav se upar uthakar mahabhaav yaa prem ke aradhy hai - 'prem jagavai virah ko, virah jagavai piu, piu jagavai jeeva, joi piu soi jiu' - the one who is piu is the same creature

 This goose cannot be revived by the reading of Pothis, and two and a half can be done only by the conduct of love
 dharm odhane kii cheez nahin he, jivan main aacharan karne kii satat satya sadhana he
 His practice begins with love
 itnaa gaharaa prem karo ki vahi tumhaare liye paramatma ho jaae
 There is so much eagerness to get it that one becomes the most reclusive, disrespectful, only then can that meditation be awakened in meditation
 vahi piu tumhaare arntman main baithe jeev ko jagaa saktaa he

 Translated 'tolstoy's Stories', three plays of Galsvardi under the names 'strike', 'silver Ki Dibiya' and 'nyaya'
 unke dwaara ratannath sarshar ke urdu upanyaas 'fasaan-e-aaazaad' kaa hindi anuwaad 'aaazaad katha' bahut mashhoor hua
 Premchand came to Hindi with the rite of Urdu and became a great Hindi writer
 hindi ko apana khaas muhaavara or khulaapan diya
 Both the story and the novel made epoch-making changes
 unhone sahitya main samayikta prabal aagrah sthapit kiya
 He made the common man the subject of his creations and, by openly penning his problems, placed him on the post of heroes of literature
 premchand se pehle hindi sahitya raja-rani ke kisson, rahasy-romaanch main ulajhaa hua tha
 Premchand took literature to the surface of truth
 unhone jivan or kalkhand kii sachai ko panne par utaara
 He continued to write for a lifetime on communalism, corruption, zamindari, indebtedness, poverty, colonialism
 premachand kii zyaadaatar rachanaaen unki hi garibi or dainyata kii kahani kahati he
 It is also not wrong that he was the creator of the common Indian
 unki rachanaaon main ve nayak hue, jise bhartiya samaaj achhut or ghrunit samajha tha
 He used the language of simple, easy and common language and presented his progressive ideas strongly to the society
 1936 main pragatisheel lekhak sangh ke pehle sammelan kii adhyakshata karte hue unhone kaha ki lekhak swabhaav se pragatisheel hota he or jo aisa nahin he vah lekhak nahin he
 Premchand is the era promoter of Hindi literature
 unhone hindi kahani main aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad kii ek nai parampari shuru kii
 Despite being such a great creator, Premchand's life is not free from accusations
 premchand ke adhyeta kamalkishor goyanka ne apni pustak 'premchand : adhyayan kii nai dishaaen' main premchand ke jivan par kuch aarope lagaakar unke sahitya kaa mahatv kam karne kii koshish kii
 The main allegations against Premchand are- Premchand left his first wife without any reason and even after second marriage, he had a relationship with another woman, Premchand cheated Vinodashankar Vyas in 'jagran Brawl', Premchand's senior press Employee Pravasi Lal Verma Frauded, Workers Strike in Premchand's Press, Premchand Supports Flick When His Daughter Sick Took more
 kamalkishor goyanka dwaara lagaae gaye ye aarope premchand ke jivan kaa ek paksh jarur hamaare saamne laate hai jisamen unki insaani kamajoriyon jaahir hoti hai lekin unke vyapak sahitya ke moolyankan par in aaropon kaa koi asar nahin pad paaya he
 People remember Prem Chandra today because of his ability which gives very little space to controversies
 premchand ko praayah "munshi premchand" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 When and how did 'munshi' become associated with Premchand's name? Most of the people in this subject believe that Premchand was a teacher in the beginning
 adhyapakon ko praaia: us samay munshi ji kaha jaataa tha
 Apart from this, there has been a tradition of putting the word 'munshi' as a form of honor before the names of Kayasthas
 sambhavat: premchand ji ke naam ke saath munshi shabd judakar rudh ho gaya
 According to Professor Shukdev Singh, Premchand never used the word 'munshi' himself in front of his name
 unka yah bhi maananaa he ki munshi shabd sammaan suchak he, jise premchand ke prashansakon ne kabhi laga diya hoga
 This fact is based on conjecture
 lekin premchand ke naam ke saath munshi visheshan judane kaa pramanik kaaran yah he ki 'hans' naamak patr premchand evam 'kanhaiyalaal munshi' ke sah sampadan main nikalataa tha
 On some copies of which Kanhaiyalal Munshi's full name was not printed, but 'munshi' was printed and also Premchand's name was printed in this way
 sampadakmunshi, premchand'hans ke sampadak premchand tathaa kanhaiyalaal munshi the
 But over time, the readers accepted 'munshi' and 'premchand' as one and became 'premchand' - 'munshi Premchand'
 yah swaabhaavik bhi he
 The general reader often reads the author's works, not seeing the subtlety of the name
 aaj premchand kaa munshi alankaran itnaa rudh ho gaya he ki maatr 'munshi' se hi premchand kaa bodh ho jaataa he tathaa 'munshi' na kehane se premchand kaa naam adhuraa-adhuraa sa lagata he
 Premchand did many experiments to reach the pinnacle of his art
 jis yug main premchand ne kalam uthaai thi, us samay unke peeche aisi koi thos viraasat nahin thi or na hi vichaar or pragatishiltaa kaa koi model hi unke saamne tha sivaay bangla sahitya ke
 At that time Bankim was Babu, Sharat Chandra and in addition there were Russian writers like Tolstoy
 lekin hote-hote unhone godaan jaise kaaljayi upanyaas kii rachana kii jo ki ek aadhunik clasik mana jaataa he
 He coined and shaped things himself
 jab bharat kaa swatantraaa andolan chal rahaa tha tab unhone katha sahitya dwaara hindi or urdu donon bhashaaon ko jo abhivyakti di usne siyaasi sargarmi ko, josh ko or andolan ko sabhi ko ubhaara or use taaqatvar banaaya or isse unka lekhan bhi taaqatvar hota gaya
 Premchand can certainly be called the first progressive writer of Hindi in this sense
 1936 main unhone pragatisheel lekhak sangh ke pehle sammelan ko sabhapati ke rup main sambodhan kiya tha
 His speech became the basis of the manifesto of the progressive movement
 premchand ne hindi main kahani kii ek parampara ko janm diya or ek puri peedi unke kadamon par aage badi, 50-60 ke dashak main renu, nagarjun auki inke baad shrinath singh ne gramin parivesh kii kahaniyaan likhi hai, wo ek tarah se premchand kii parampara ke taratamya main aati hai
 Premchand was a revolutionary creator, he saw not only patriotism but also many evil practices prevalent in the society and put them before the people through the story
 unhone us samay ke samaaj kii jo bhi samasyaayen thim un sabhi ko chitrit karne kii shuruyaat kar di thi
 Dalits also come in it, women also
 ye sabhi vishay aage chalakar hindi sahitya ke bade vimarsh bane

 Main article Aryabhatiya aryabhat ke kaary ke pratyaksh vivaran sirf aryabhatiy se hi gyaat hai
 The name Aryabhatiya is given by later commentators, Aryabhata himself would not have named it; This is mentioned by his disciple Bhaskara i in the articles of Ashmakatantra or Ashmaka
 ise kabhi kabhi arya-shat-asht - jo kii unke paath main chhandon kii sankhya he- ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 This sutra is written in a very concise style similar to literature, where each line helps to recall a complex system

 The most influence in India was on the astrological tradition of the state of Kerala
 aryabhat bhartiya ganitagyon main sabase mahatvapurn sthaan rakhte hai
 In 120 Aryachandas, he has written the principles of astrology and the mathematics related to it in his Aryabhatiya treatise
 unhone ek ore ganit main purvavarti archimedes se bhi adhik sahi tathaa sunishchit pai ke maan ko nirupit kiya to duusari ore khagolvigyaan main sabase pehali baar udhaaharan ke saath yah ghoshit kiya gaya ki swayan prithvi apni dhuree par gumti he
 This is the importance of what Aryabhata had discovered without the present day advanced means of astrology
 koparnicus ne jo khoj kii thi uski khoj aryabhat hajaar varsh pehle kar chuke the
 In "golapada", Aryabhata wrote "when a man in a boat moves with the flow, then he understands that the material trees, stones, mountains etc

 aryabhat ke anusaar kisi vrutt kii paridhi or vyas kaa sambandh 62,832 : 20,000 aata he jo chaar dashamalav sthaan tak shuddh he
 Aryabhata has used a very scientific method of representing large numbers with a group of letters
 sthaan-mulya ank pranali, jise sarvapratham teesri sadi kii bakhshali pandulipi main dekha gaya, unke kaaryon main spasht rup se vidyaman thi
 He did not use the symbol, of course, but according to the French mathematician Georges Efrah — with zero coefficients, knowledge of zero as a place holder for the power of ten was contained in Aryabhata's place-value digit system
 haalanki, aryabhat ne brahmi ankon kaa prayog nahin kiya tha; vaidic kaal se chali aa rahi sanskrit parampara ko nirantar rakhte hue unhone sankhya ko nirupit karne ke liye varnmaala ke aksharon kaa upyog kiya,matraaon ko smarak ke rup main vyakt karnaa
 Aryabhata worked on Pai's approximation and may have come to know that Pai is irrational
 aryabhatium ke duusare bhaag main ve likhte hai: According to this, the ratio of diameter and circumference is × 8 + 62000) / 2 xxrep 4 0 = 3
1416, which is perfectly accurate up to five significant figures
 aryabhat ne asann, pichley shabd ke thik pehle aane vaala, shabd kii vyakhya kii vyakhya karte hue kaha he ki yah na keval ek sanniktan he, varan yah ki mulya athulaneey he
 If this is correct, then this is a very sophisticated approach, as the irrationality of pi in Europe was proved only by Lambert in 1761
 aryabhatiy ke arabi main anuwaad ke pashchaat bijganit par mohammad ebn musa al-khwaarizmi kii pustak main is sanniktan kaa ullekh kiya gaya tha
 In Mathematica 6, Aryabhata describes the area of a triangle as: iskaa anuwaad yah he : kisi tribhuj kaa kshetrafal, lamb ke saath bhujaa ke aadhe ke parinaam ke baraabar hota he
 Aryabhata has discussed the subject of duality in his work and named it Ardha-jya which literally means "ardha-tantra"
 aasaani kii vajah se logon ne ise jya kahana shuru kar diya
 When his work was translated from Sanskrit to Arabic by Arabic writers, he called it Jiba
 chunki, arabi lekhan main, swaron kaa istemaal bahut kam hota he, isliye iskaa or sankshipt naam pad gaya jb
 When later writers came to understand that JB is a short form of Jiba, they started using Jiba back
 jiba kaa arth he "khoh" yaa "khai" 
 Later in the twelfth century, when Gherardo of Cremona translated these writings from Arabic into Latin, he replaced the Arabic jiba with its Latin counterpart sinus, which literally means "lair" or trench
 or uske baad angreji main, sinus hi sin ban gaya
 a problem of particular interest to Indian mathematicians since ancient times has been to find integer solutions to equations that are in the form ax + b = cy, a topic known today as the diophantine equation
 yahan aryabhatiy par bhaskar kii vyakhya se ek udhaaharan dete hai: That is, say n = 8x + 5 = 9y +4 = 7z +1
 This leaves the smallest value 85 for N

 Such equations are widely discussed in the ancient Vedic text Sulab Sutra, the more ancient parts of which date back to 800 BC
 Can be older
 aisi samasyaon ke hal ke liye aryabhat kii vidhi ko kuttak vidhi kaha gaya he
 kuṭṭaka kuttak means grinding, that is, breaking into small pieces and this method consisted of a recursive algorithm for writing the original segments as small numbers

 Diophantine equations are used in cryptology and the RSA Convention, 2006 focused on the Kuttaka method and earlier works of Sulvasutra
 aryabhatiy main aryabhat ne virgon or ghanon kii shrenee ke rochak parinaam pradaan kiye hai
 And aryabhat kii khagol vigyaan pranali audaayak pranali kehalaati thi, khagol vigyaan par unke baad ke lekh, jo satahi taur parek dwitiya model, prastaavit karte hai, kho gaye hai, parantu inhe aanshik rup se brahmagupta ke khandakhadyak main hui charchaaon se punah nirmit kiya ja saktaa he
 In some texts, they attribute the rotation of the Earth to the virtual motion of the sky
 prathit hota he ki aryabhat yah maanate the ki prithvi apni dhuree kii parikrama karti he
 This is known from a statement referencing Sri Lanka, which describes the motion of stars as the relative motion produced by the rotation of the Earth
 aglaa chand taron or grahon kii gati ko vaastavik gati ke rup main varnit karata he: Lanka here is a reference point on the equator, which was taken to be the same value in terms of the meridian for astronomical calculations
 aryabhat ne saura mandal ke ek bhukendriya model kaa varnan kiya he, jisame surya or chandramaa gruhachakra dwaara gati karte hai, jo ki parikrama karata heprithvi kii
 In this model, which is found in the Pitamahist theory, the motion of each of the planets is controlled by two planetary cycles, a small slow planetary cycle and a large early planetary cycle
 prithvi se duuri ke anusaar grahon kaa kram is prakaar he : chandramaa, budh, shukr, suraj, mangal,brihaspati, shani or nakshatra The position and duration of the planets were calculated as relative to points moving uniformly, in the case of Mercury and Venus, which revolve around the Earth at the same speed as the average Sun, and Mars, Jupiter and Saturn In the case of, which move around the Earth in the zodiac at their specific speed
 khagol vigyaan ke adhikansh itihaaskaaron ke anusaar yah dwi grahchakr vaala model tolemi ke pehle ke greek khagol vigyaanke tatwon ko pradarshit karata he
 Another element of Aryabhata's model, the Sighrocca, the period of the basic planets in relation to the Sun, is seen by some historians as a mark of an underlying Sun-centered model
 unhone kaha ki chandramaa or grah surya ke paravartit prakaash se chamakate hai
 Unlike the existing cosmology, in which the eclipses were the pseudo-planet Nispand point Rahu and Ketu, they described the eclipses as being cast by the earth and the shadow falling on it
 is prakaar chandragahan tab hota he jab chandramaa prithvi kii chaaya main pravesh karata he or prithvi kii is chaaya ke aakaar or vistaar kii vistaar se charchaa kii or phir grahan ke dauraan grahan vaale bhaag kaa aakaar or isaki gananaa
 Later Indian astronomers improved these calculations, but Aryabhata's methods provided the major gist
 yah gananaatmak misaal itani sateek thi ki 18 veen sadi ke vaigyanik guilom le jentil ne, pandicherry kii apni yatra ke dauraan, paaya ki bharatiyon kii gananaa ke anusaar 1765-08-30 ke chandragrahan kii avadhi 41 second kam thi, jabaki uske chart 68 second adhik darshaate the
 According to Aryabhata, the circumference of the Earth is 39,968
0582 kilometers, which is only 0
2% less than its actual value of 40,075
0167 kilometers
 yah sanniktan unani ganitagya, eratosthenas kii sanganana ke upar ek ullekhneey sudhaar tha,200 i
) jinaki gananaa kaa aadhunik ikaayiyon main to pataa nahin he, parantu unke anumaan main lagbhag 5-10% kii ek truti avashya thi
 If added to the modern English units of time, Aryabhata's calculation of the Earth's period of time) was 23 hours 56 minutes and 4
1 seconds; Modern time is 23: 56: 4
091
 isi prakaar, unke hisaab se prithvi ke varsh kii avadhi 365 din 6 ghante 12 minute 30 second, aadhunik samay kii gananaa ke anusaar isamen 3 minute 20 second kii truti he
 The perception of the constellation of time was known in most other astronomical systems at that time, but this computation was probably the purest at that time
 aryabhat kaa daawa tha ki prithvi apni hi dhuree par gumti he or unke grah sambandhi grahchakr modelon ke kuch tatv usee gati se ghoomte hai jis gati se surya ke chaaron ore grah ghoomte hai
 Thus it is suggested that Aryabhata's calculations were based on the underlying Sun-centered model, in which planets orbit the Sun
 ek samiksha main is surya kendrit vyakhya kaa vistrut khandan he
 This review BL a book by Van der Varden describes "this book is unknown about Indian home doctrine and it directly contradicts every word of Aryabhata"
 However, some people accept that Aryabhata's system stems from an earlier Sun-centered model, which he did not know
 yah bhi daawa kiya gaya he ki ve grahon ke maarg ko andakaar maanate the, haalaanki iske liye koi bhi praathmik sakshya prastut nahin kiya gaya he
 Although Aristarchus of Samos and sometimes Heraclides of Pontus are credited with knowledge of the Sun-centered theory, Greek astronomy known in ancient India makes no discussion of the Sun-centered theory
 bhartiya khagoleey parampara main aryabhat ke kaary kaa bada prabhaav tha or anuwaad ke madhyam se inhone kai padosi samskritiyon ko prabhavit kiya
 Its Arabic translation was particularly influential during the Islamic Golden Age
 unke kuch parinaamon ko al-khwarijmi dwaara uddhrut kiya gaya he or 10 veen sadi ke arabi vidwaan al-biruni dwaara unhen sandarbhit kiya gaya gaya he, jinhone apane varnan main likhaa he ki aryabhat ke anuyaayi maanate the ki prithvi apni dhuree par gumti he
 His definitions of sine, cosine as well as versine, and inverse sine, influenced the origin of trigonometry
 ve pehle vyakti bhi the jinhone sin or varsin talikaon ko, 0 degree se 90 degree tak 3
75 ° antaraalon main, 4 dashamalav sthanon kii sookshmata tak nirmit kiya
 In fact the modern names of "sine" and "cosine" are the incorrect pronunciation of the words sine and cosine as practiced by Aryabhata
 unhen arabi main jiba or kojiba ke rup main uccharit kiya gaya tha
 He was then misinterpreted by Gerard of Cremona during the translation of an Arabic geometry text into Latin; He took the Arabic word 'pocket' for jiba which means "a seam in a dress", el sinus
 aryabhat kii khagoleey gananaa kii vidhiyaan bhi bahut prabhaavshaalee thi
 Along with trigonometric tables, they were widely used in the Islamic world
 or anek arabi khagoleey talikaon kii gananaa ke liye istemaal kii jaati thi
 In particular, the astronomical tables found in the works of the Arabic Spain scientist al-jharkali were translated into Latin as the tables of Toledo and have been in use for centuries as the most subtle almanac in Europe

 The Jalali Tithipatra estimates its dates on the basis of actual solar transit, as in Aryabhata
 This type of date sheet requires an almanac to calculate the dates
 yadhyapi tithiyon kii gananaa karnaa kathin tha, par jalaalee tithipatr main gregory tithipatr se kam mausami trutiyaan thi
 India's first satellite, Aryabhata, was named after him

 An institute near Nainital in India has been named Aryabhata Observational Science Research Institute for research in astronomy, astrophysics and atmospheric sciences

 Bacillus Aryabhata, a species of bacteria discovered in 2009 by ISRO scientists, is named after him
