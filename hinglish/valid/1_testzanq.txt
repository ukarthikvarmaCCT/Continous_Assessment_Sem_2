 It also attempts to explain the construction of surface relief in the form of continents, oceans and mountains, and the geographical distribution of events such as earthquakes and volcanoes

 The most important of these evidences is the evidence related to pauperism which confirmed the Sagar Nital diffusion

 According to this theory, the upper layer of the earth, about 80 to 100 km thick, which is called Sthalmandal, and which includes the earth's crust and the upper part of the earth's crust, is broken into several pieces called plates
 ye platen neeche sthit asthenosphere kii ardhapighalit parat par tair raheen hai or saamanyatya lagbhag 10-40 mimi / varsh kii gati se gatisheel hai haalaanki inamen kuch kii gati 160 mimi / varsh bhi he
 The movement of these plates presents an explanation of the origin and mountain formation of the earth's present surface pattern and it has been observed that often earthquakes fall on the boundaries of these plates and volcanoes are also found along these plate boundaries

 The term plate was first used by Canadian geologist Wilson and the term plate tectonics was first used by Morgan

 a list of these is given below: kuch vidwaan uttari america plate or dakshini america plate ko ek hi maanate hue badi platon kii sankhya chah manaate hai
 There are many variations in the number of small plates, but their number is generally accepted more than 100

 That is, some people believed that the size of the Earth was reduced by contraction after the origin and as a result of this contraction the forces on the surface of the earth are located and the twists are located in the form of mountains

 On the contrary, some believed that the continents have moved horizontally and due to the collision, the force in the upper surface has created mountains

 It was only in the early sixteenth century that scholars marked the similarity of the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean to each other

 Later American geographer FB Taylor spoke of a kind of flow of continents by the gravitational force of the moon in 1908–10, and also attributed it to the origin of the Tertiary era mountains
 par unki baat par kisi ne bahut dhyaan nahin diya
 Wagner, who was an archaeologist and archaeologist, proposed the idea that the distribution of climate in ancient times could be interpreted if the continents were to be considered dynamic and he proposed the theory of continental displacement in 1912 which His book, published in 1915, was published in Origins of Continents and Oceans

 The most prominent landforms found on these banks are the Central Oceanic Ridge

 Due to the construction of new plate, it is also called creative edge
 sangrakshi kinaaraa vah he jiske sahare do plate ek duusare ko ragadate hue gatisheel hon, arthath na to apsaran ho rahaa ho na hi abhisaran
 Normally, rubbing each other using this edge moves in opposite directions, but it is not mandatory, if two plates move in the same direction and their motion is different, they can still form a protective edge by rubbing their edges
 inke sahare transform bhransh paae jate hai
 Since neither the plate nor the destruction is formed, they are called protective / protective edges where the status quo is preserved in the context of construction / destruction
 plate vivartaniki siddhant valit parvaton ke nirmaan kii sabase nayi vyakhya prastut karata he
 For example, a description of the origin of the mountains of the Alpine mountain system can be presented

 Regarding the origin of the Himalayas, this theory holds that the origin of this range is due to the approaching of the Tibet Plate and the Indian Plate and the compression of sediments deposited in the Tethys Sagar or Bhusannati

 In November 1980, Indira Gandhi unveiled the statue of Ayyanki in the Kaudiyar square in Thiruvananthapuram
 ayyanki kaa janm 28 agast 1863 ko venganoor, tiruvanantpuram, travnakor main hua tha
 He was the eldest of eight children born to Ayyan and Mala, who were members of the Pulayar community of untouchables

 The Pulayars were regarded as the lowest group of people of the state and suffered badly from oppressive discrimination from members of the powerful Nair caste

 The result of the continued protests, which sometimes turned violent and known as the Chaliar riots, was that by 1900 the Pulayars had the right to use most of the roads in the state, although they were still from those Were banned led to Hindu temples

 Ayyanki also drew inspiration from the activities of Narayana Guru, a contemporary social reformer of the Ezhava caste, though the two men differed in their philosophy and means of turning them into reality
 narayan guru ne ejhava or asprishy samudaayon jaise pulyrs ke bich gathbandhan banane kaa prayaas kiya tha, lekin unke bhaaiyon se vichaaron ke hinsak virodh hue the or pulyrs ayayanki ke udai tak nirdayee bane rahe
 Ayyanki also called for improving access to education

 Changes in Christianity were a prerequisite for attendance at such schools, and there were cases where the Pulayars offered to contribute to the cost of supplying teachers

 The government was already trying to modernize the social welfare approach in an attempt to impress upon the British colonial administration that there was no need to annex the region
 1895 ke baad asprishy samudaayon ke liye kai saarvajanik skool khole gaye the lekin praathmik shiksha kaa adhikaar daayre main simit tha
 The state funding of education became effective in 1904 but even after the government ordered schools to admit these untouchables in 1907, local authorities found ways to refuse it

 It attracted support from both Hindus and Christians

 Their response may be the first strike action by agricultural workers in the region, who have withdrawn their labor from areas owned by the upper castes until the government agrees to lift the restrictions on education altogether

 Caste Hindus had insisted that custom was necessary to isolate the inferior status of untouchable people, but during the 19th century their belief was under attack from various untouchable groups and Christian missionaries

 The Bund and the Samudra Sahitya Academy Award and Soviet Land Nehru Award are considered to be the best novels of the famous Hindi novelist Amritlal Nagar
 is upanyaas main lakhanu ko centre main rakhkar apane desh ke madhyavargeey naagarik or unke gun-dosha bhare jivan kaa kalatmak chithran kiya gaya he
 The live characterization of the characters is particularly visible in this novel
 'buund or samudr' amritlal nagar kaa aakaar evam vishay-vastu donon drushtiyon se mahaan upanyaas mana jaataa he
 It was first published in 1956 AD from Kitab Mahal, Allahabad
 punah 1998 i0 main raajakmal prakaashan, nayi dilli se paperbax main iskaa prakaashan hua
 It is a pure social novel by Nagar ji, in which fine and fine depiction of the lower middle class and to some extent the middle class and lower class from upper middle class has also been done in detail
 'buund or samudr' main 'buund' vyakti kaa or 'samudr' samaaj kaa pratik he
 The symbolism of this name in another form proves meaningful
 lekhak ne is upanyaas main katha kshetra ke liye lakhanu ko chunaa he or usamen bhi vishesh rup se chowk ke gali-koochon ko
 In a portrait of a locality, the author has shown many forms of Indian society
 is tarah 'buund' ke parichay ke madhyam se 'samudr' ke parichay kaa praytn pratikit hota he
 In this novel, the inter-relation between the individual and society is explored on a wide scale
 is upanyaas main varnit samaaj desh kii swadhinata ke turant baad kaa he
 Nagar ji has concentrated it in a Mohalla Chowk in Lucknow for illustration
 isaki katha main mukhya bhaag nibhaane vaale paatr hai-- sajjan, vanakanya, mahipal or nagin chand jain urf karnal
 a gentleman is an artist, a painter
 vanakanya svachhand pravriti kii roodhi virodhini sakriy chetanayukta navayuvati he
 Mahipal is a passive writer who pretends to socialism and despite being a businessman, Naginchand Jain aka Colonel is an active worker who is ready to help the oppressed
 in sabake saath hi puraatanta, andhvishwaas evam atyadhik tikhepan ke saath-saath nirmal karunaa evam ahaituk rup se auchity samarthan kii adbhut paatra tai upanyaas kii dhuri rup main he

 Apart from this, there is a lot of property and property, there is a car, a bungalow and a whole army of servants
 phir bhi vilasita ke kuch dabe sanskaron ke baavjood vah vilasita se hatakar bhi kaam karata he or mohalle ke jivan kaa adhyayan karke apni kala ko nayaa aayam dene kii ichha se chowk main ek cameraa kiraye par lekar rahata he
 Later, Tai also visits her mansion after coming in close contact
 tai sajjan ko putravat or vanakanya ko aarambhik virodh ke baavjood bahu maanakar sneh detii he
 Sajjan, despite his inherited feudal rites, comes into contact with Vanakanya and rebuilds himself and contributes to social development and change
 vanakanya ke sampark ke kaaran dhire-dhire usamen anek badlaav aate hai
 He had intermarried with Vanakanya and due to thoughts as well as events, he reaches into serious questions about women's destiny and human faith
 is upanyaas ke gathan main lekhak ne maano 'buund' main 'samudr' ko samaa dene kaa kathin or durlabh praytn kiya he
 This group of characters from different situations and different levels are present in this novel
 sajjan or vanakanya ke bilkul sabhy prem'kahani kaa sahaara lete hue is upanyaas main ek tarah se charitron kaa van upasthit kar diya gaya he or un sabko kushaltapurvak kaaphi had tak sanbhaala bhi gaya he
 The pictorial composition of women of different beliefs, situations and levels is also seen
 alp shikshit bhartiya samaaj kii sthitiyon kaa baarik chithran is upanyaas ke uddeshy kaa pramukh ang he
 The author is portrayed with the utmost credibility as a conservative society, which is afraid of many things, often exhibits cowardice, and becomes violent by seeing a threat to its stereotypes
 naveen vichaaron ko apnaane ke praytn ke baavjood kis prakaar saamanti sanskaar vyakti ko sarthak disha evam sakriy kadam apnaane evam uthaane se vanchit rakhata he iskaa vyaavhaarik chithran upanyaas kii rachanaatmak kushalta kaa parichay detaa he
 The portrayal of a life-failing character like writer Mahipal is also very lively and the overall characterization of Tai is so polymorphic, complete and well-written that it has been considered one of the unique characters of Hindi fiction
 mohalle kii bahurupi boli-vaaniyon kaa sangrah is upanyaas ko bhashaa vigyaan ke liye ek upadan strot bana detaa he
 Easily transforming the novel into interesting storytelling for a world-class form automatically reveals evidence of the success of the novel's craftsmanship
 'buund or samudr' kii sarvaadhik santulit evam kaaphi had tak paripurna samiksha dow0 ramvilas sharma ne likhi he
 This review was first published in Issue 20 of Criticism
 phir ise bhishma saahani, raamji mishra evam bhagwati prasad nidaaria sampadit 'aadhunik hindi upanyaas' main bhi sankalit kiya gaya or phir yahi samiksha vibhuti narayan raay sampadit 'vartmaan sahitya' ke shatabdi katha par kendrit visheshank main bhi sankalit kii gayi
 In this review, Dr
 Sharma has not overlooked any shortcomings of his beloved narrator, despite showing the merits of this novel
 isaki dher visheshtaayen dikhalaate hue bhi unhone lekhak kii vaicharik bhrantiyon, chitratmak trutiyon evam varnanaatmak bahultaaon -- sabhi kamiyon kaa spasht ullekh kiya he or santulit rup main vichaar karte hue upanyaas ke mahatv ko rekhaankit kiya he
 Despite all these faults, he believes that 'boond aur Samudra' is a beautiful novel
 bhartiya samaaj ke upar se aatmasantosh kaa pardaa lekhak ne khinchakar uske bheetar kii vibhatsata sabake saamne prakat kar di he
 The social experience accumulated in the 'drops and seas' makes it an encyclopedia of its own kind
 use ek baar nahin baar-baar padhane ko man karegaa
 There are some places which will not be filled even after repeated reading
 nihsandeh swadhin bharat kaa yah ek uttam upanyaas he
 Nemichandra Jain, after discussing its various merits and demerits, decides that 'bund and Samudra' is an important and powerful work of post-war Hindi novel which demanded to keep the level of evaluation higher and stricter due to its extraordinary achievement
 is
 ve ise us daur kii sarvshereshth kriti hone kii sambhaavna se yukt hote hue bhi vaisaa na ho sakane vaala maanakar bhi pichley das-pandraa varshon ke sabase mahatvapurn upanyaason main nissandeh pariganya maanate hai
 Madhuresh ji believes that even with many hints of the possibilities of his forthcoming development in both the previous novels of Nagar ji, 'boond aur Samudra' can also be considered as one of his creative leaps, whose established record would later break for him
 It was not possible to achieve - despite his long composition journey
 nagar ji ko 'buund or samudr' par nagari prachaarini sabha, varanasi dwaara 'batuka prasad puraskaar' evam 'sudhakar rajat padak' pradaan kiya gaya tha
 The novel was also translated into Russian and its first version was sold out within a year

 For example, a folder with two files opens in a smaller window than a folder with ten files
 iske alaava, jab ek folder main saikadon filein hoti hai, to vah folder swachaalit rup se "list" drishy main pradarshit hoga
 yah browzing mod vindos 3
x ke program manager kii yaad taaja karata he
 Windows 95 was the closest Windows Explorer to be a special file manager in the same color as the Macintosh Finder
 windos explorer ke baad ke sanskarnon main, uski adhikansh kaaryakshmata difolt rup se aksham ho gai or iske bajaay usne ek 'ekal-windo" nevigation dizin ko pasand kiya, ek darshan jise baad main mike oes eks main sthaan mila
 Windows Explorer used the views of the object-oriented user interface and provided each file object with an extensible context menu
 context menu ke peeche mul vichaar tha shaktishaalee upyogkartaaon ko fil sambandhi adeshon ko kriyanvit karne ke ek adhik kushal or suruchipurna tarika pradaan karnaa
 With the release of the Windows Desktop Update, Windows Explorer integrated with Internet Explorer, most notably between the recently visited directory as well as the navigation arrows to rotate in Internet Explorer's Favorites menu
 With joining
 At the time, these changes gave rise to non-trust concerns about the included feature, which was seen as an application failure, but this feature has been adopted by most other file browsers
 ek adress baar ko bhi vindos explorer main joda gaya, jisamen ek upyogkarta nirdeshika path ko sidhe likh saktaa he or us foulder main vah pahunch jayega
 internet pate ke liye yah yuarel baar ke rup main kaam karata he; web prishth windo ke mukhya hisse main khulte hai
 Another feature that was based on Internet Explorer technology was customized folders
 Such a folder contained a secret web page that controlled how Windows Explorer would display the content
 The feature proved to have security vulnerabilities due to its reliance on Active x objects and scripting and was removed with the introduction of Windows XP
 anya nai suvidhaayen: The "web-style" folder view, in which the Explorer pane on the left displays details of the currently selected content, opens by default
 kuch vishesh fil prakaar ke liye, jaise media fil, baayen falak par ek purvavlokan bhi pradarshit hota he
 Windows 2000 Explorer includes an interactive media player for a preview of sound and video files
 haalanki, is tarah ke privyssor ko, third-party shell ekstansion ke upyog ke madhyam se vindos m Me or vindos XP main sakriy kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki adhyatan vindos explorer, custom thambanel purvavlokan or tultip handlers kii anumati detaa he
 The default file tooltip displays the file title, author, subject, and comments; This metadata can be read by a specific NTFS stream, if the file is on an NTFS volume, or by an OLE structured storage stream, if that file is a structured storage document
 offis 95 ke baad se sabhi microsoft offis, sanrachit bhandaaran kaa upyog karte hai, isliye unke metadata vindos 2000 explorer difolt tultip main pradarshan yogya hai
 File shortcuts can also store comments that are displayed as tooltip when the mouse hovers over that shortcut
 daaen haath vaala falak, jo aam taur par sirf filon or folderon ko suchit karata he, use bhi anukulit kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, the contents of a system folder are not displayed by default, instead a right-side pane displays a warning to the user that modifying the contents of this system folder may damage their computer
 folder template filon main DIV tatwon kaa upyog karte hue atirikt explorer falak ko paribhaashit karnaa sambhav he
 This feature was misused by computer viruses that used malicious scripts, Java applets, or activex controls in folder template files as their infection vector
 is tarah ke do virus hai VBS / roor-c or vbs

 Other Explorer uis that can be customized include columns, icon overlay, and search provider in the "detail" view: The new dhtml-based search pane has been integrated into Windows 2000 Explorer, found in previous versions of Explorer Separate search is the opposite of dialoug
 khoj kshamtaaon ko joda gaya, jiske tahat dastavejon ke liye purna-paath khoj pradaan kiya gaya, jise taarikh, aakaar or fil prakaar ke aadhaar par chhaantane kaa vikalp shaamil tha
 The indexing service was also integrated into the operating system, and the creation of search pens in Explorer allowed files to be indexed by its database
 The ability to customize standard toolbar buttons was also added
 vindos XP main windos explorer ke liye mahatvapurn parivartanon ko anjaam diya gaya, swaroop or kaaryaatmak, donon tareekon se
 microsoft ne explorer ko vishesh rup se adhik khojayogy or kaary-aadhaarit banane par dhyaan kendrit kiya or saath hi saath kai suvidhaon ko joda jisane ek "digital hub" ke rup main computer ke badhate istemaal ko pratibimbit kiya
 Windows Explorer in Windows Server 2003 includes all the features that Windows XP has, but the task pane and search partner are disabled by default
 task pen, paramparaagat folder tree drishy ke bajaay windo ke bain ore pradarshit he
 It presents the user with a list of common actions and destinations that are relevant to the current directory or selected file
 udhaaharan ke liye, jab adhiktar chitron vaali ek nirdeshika main hon, to "chitra kaary" kaa ek set dikhaaya jaataa he, jo in chitron ko ek slide sho ke rup main pradarshit karne, print karne, yaa print kaa order dene ke liye online jane ke vikalpon kii peshkash karata he
 Conversely, a folder containing music files will offer the option to play those files in a media player, or to go online to buy music
 Windows XP had a media bar, but was removed with SP1
 media baar keval vindos XP RTM main uplabdh tha
 Each folder also has a "file and Folder Task", which offers options for creating new folders, sharing a folder on the local network, publishing files or folders for a web site, as well as other common tasks
 Such as copying, deleting, or deleting a file or folder
 File types that have identified themselves as being printable have the option to print the file listed
 "fil and folder task" ke neeche "adar places" he or saath main anya aam sthanon ke liye link he jaise "maai computer", "control panel" or "maai documants"
 ye is baat par nirbhar karte hue badalata he ki upyogkarta kis folder main tha, jiske chalate microsoft kii aalochana kii gai ki vah nevigation vikalpon ko pradarshit karne main susangat nahin rahaa he
 Beneath "other Places" is a "details" pane that gives additional information - typically file size and date, but based on file type, a thumbnail preview, author, image dimensions, or other details
 vindos explorer tulbaar par "folder" batan, folders ke paaramparik tree vyuu or task pen ke bich togal hota he
 Users can get rid of the task pane or restore it for which they must use this sequence: Tools - Folder Options - General - Show Common Tasks / Use Windows Classic Folders
 khoj ko adhik aakarshak or maitreepurn banane ke ek prayaas main, microsoft ne anemated "search companian" ko pesh kiya he; difolt charitra ek pilla he jiskaa naam rover he or saath hi teen anya charitra hai bhi uplabdh ke saath he
 The similarity of these search partners is to a large extent the office assistant of Microsoft Office, even in terms of "gait" and sound
 khud khoj kshamta hi kaaphi had tak windos me or vindos 2000 ke samaan he, jahaan saath main ek pramukh suvidha he: khoj ko keval un filon ko khojane ke liye nirdeshit kiya ja saktaa he jinka vargeekaran "documants" yaa "chitra, sangeet or video" main kiya gaya he; yah suvidha bade paimaane par is vajah se ullekhneey he ki kaise vindos yah nirdhaarit karata he ki koun si filon ko in shreniyon ke antargat vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 To maintain a relevant list of file types, Windows Explorer connects with Microsoft and downloads a set of XML files that define what these file types are
 haalanki khud hanirahit hote hue, is suvidha ne gopneeyata ke kai pairokaron or fyrwal software sthapit kiye hue upyogkartaaon kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya he, jinka yah maananaa he ki har baar sthaneey khoj karte samay windos kaa microsoft ke sarwar se judana anaavashyak he
 Windows XP improves image preview in Explorer, providing a filmstrip view
 "back" or "privius" batan ke madhyam se chitron kaa abhigam suvidhajanak tareeke se kiya ja saktaa he or "rotate" batan kii ek jodi chhaviyon ke 90 degree ke dakshinavart or vipareet disha main ghumaav ko pradaan karti he
 In addition to the filmstrip view, there is a 'thumbnail' mode that displays images in the folder in a thumbnail size
 ek folder jisamen chitra hai vah bhi bade se foulder iken ke upar chaar chitron ke thambanel ko pradarshit karegaa
 Web sites that provide image hosting services can be added to the Windows Explorer, which the user can use to select images on the computer and upload them correctly, including those with FTP or web interfaces
 Complex solutions do not have to be encountered
 vindos explorer main windos ke pichley sanskaran se mahatvapurn parivartan shaamil he jaise behatar filtering, sorting, gruping or stacking
 ekikrut desktop khoj ke saath sanyukt ho kar, vindos explorer prayoktaaon ko apni filon ko khojane or unhen niojit karne ke nae tareekon kii anumati detaa he, jaise stacks 
 "stacks" vyuu, filon ko un maapdand ke anusaar samoohon main rakhata he jaisaa ki upyogkarta dwaara nirdisht kiya jaataa he
 Stacks can be clicked to filter the files shown in Windows Explorer
 isamen khoj ko abhaasi folders yaa search folder ke rup main rakshit karne kii bhi kshamta he
 a search folder is simply an XML file that stores the search in a way that can be used by the Windows search system
 abhigam kiye jane par, khoj nishpadit hoti he or parinaam ekatrit hote hai or ek abhaasi folder main prastut kiye jate hai
 At the time of sorting the material, the sort order does not remain ascending or descending continuously
 prayek gundharm kaa ek pasandida chantai prakaar he
 For example, the default order of sort by date is descending and also the size
 But the default order of name and type is ascending
 vindos explorer main ek computer par filon ke drishy main sanshodhan shaamil hai
 a new additional feature in Windows Explorer for Vista and Server 2008 is the Details pane, which displays metadata and information related to the selected file or folder
 ditels pen fil ke thambanel ko bhi pradarshit karata he yaa fil prakaar ke ek iken ko agar file main drishy jaankaree nahin he
 In addition, various images are presented in a thumbnail to provide more information about the file, such as a picture frame around an image file, or a filmstrip on a video file
 Thumbnails can be enlarged
 ditels pen, kuch shabdic rup ke metadata ke parivartan kii anumati detaa he jaise ki un filon ke andar 'lekhak' or 'sheershak' ko jo vindos explorer ke bheetar unka samarthan karte hai
 a new type of metadata called tags allows users to add descriptive words to documents for convenient classification and retrieval
 kuch filein mukt metadata kaa samarthan karti hai or upyogkartaaon ko apni filon ke liye nae prakaar ke metadata ko paribhaashit karne kii anumati detii hai
 Out-of-the-box, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 support Microsoft Office and most audio and video files
 anya fil prakaaron ke liye samarthan ko tathaapi shell ke anurodh par metadata ko punarprapt karne ke liye vishesh software likh kar joda ja saktaa he
 Metadata stored only on NTFS in an alternate stream of a file can no longer be viewed or edited by the 'summary' tab of the file's property
 iske bajaay, sabhi metadata fil ke andar sangrahit hai, jisase yah file system par nirbhar naa rahete hue hameshaa file ke saath yatra karegaa
 Windows Explorer introduces a new layout in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008
 vindos XP ke taskpen ko sheersh par ek tulbaar or bain taraf ek nevigation pen dwaara pratisthapit kar diya gaya he
 Navigation pens usually include the Access folder and the preopulated search folder
 filon or folderon ko dekhne ke liye saat alag-alag vyuu uplabdh hai, jinke naam hai, list, ditels, small aickens, medium aickens, large aickens, extra large aickens yaa tiles 
 automatic folder tip discovery, swachaalit rup se ek foulder kii saamagree kaa pataa lagaataa he or sateek detail settings pradarshit karata he
 File and folder actions such as cut, copy, paste, undo, read, delete, rename, and properties are created in a dropdown menu that appears when the Organize button is clicked
 organaise batan kaa upyog karke explorer windo kaa leout badalanaa bhi sambhav he
 Users can choose whether to display the classic menu, a search pen, a preview pen, a reading pen, or a navigation pen
 In addition to the details pane, the preview pane allows previewing of files
 iske alaava, explorer kisi bhi image formet ke liye purvavlokan pradaan kar saktaa he yadi us formet ke liye aavashyak kodak windos imaging component main sthapit he to
 The address bar has been replaced with a breadcrumbs bar to make navigation easier
 yah vartmaan sthaan ke liye purna path dikhaata he
 Instead of pressing the back button repeatedly, clicking on any place in the path hierarchy leads the user to that level
 yah vaisaa hi he jaisaa vindos XP main sambhav he, jisamen "back" ke bagal main sthit ek chote adhomukhi tir ko dabaakar purv ke abhigamit foulder kii suchi se kisi bhi foulder kaa chayan kiya jaataa tha
 It is also possible to move to a subfolder of the current folder using the arrow to the right of the last item, or the route can be copied or edited manually by clicking on the location on the right side of it
 jaisaa ki microsoft dwaara nirmit kai anya vindos vista anuprayogon ke maamle main he, yahaan bhi menu baar difolt rup se chupa he
 By pressing the Alt key, the menu bar appears
 vindos explorer main check bakse ekaadhik filon ke chayan kii anumati dete hai
 The blank and used space on all drives are shown in the horizontal indicator bar
 vibhinn aakaaron ke iken kaa samarthan diya gaya he - 16 x 16 24 x 24 32 x 32 48, x 48 64, x 64 96, x, 128 96 x 128 or 256 x 256
 vindos explorer ek slider kaa istemaal karte hue iken ko bada yaa chota kar saktaa he yaa phir Ctrl kunjee ko dabaakar mouse ke chakke kaa istemaal karte hue bhi aisa kiya ja saktaa he
 In addition, with the release of Windows Internet Explorer 7 for Windows Vista and Server 2008 and Windows XP, Internet Explorer is no longer integrated with Windows Explorer
 puraane sanskaran ke vipareet, vindos explorer apane swayan kii prakriya main internet explorer ke niyantran kii mejabaan nahin karata, balki jab aavashyaktaa hoti he to yah ek nai prakriya shuru karata he
 Windows Explorer does not display web pages in Windows Vista and Server 2008, and IE7 does not support use as a file manager, although one would start it as a separate requirement
 ek foulder se duusare foulder main filon ko copy yaa sthaanantaran karte samay, agar do filon kaa naam ek hi he, to us fil kaa punah namakaran karne kaa ab ek vikalp uplabdh he; windos ke pichley sanskarnon main, upyogkarta ko yaa to ek pratisthaapan chunane ke liye yaa phir fil ke sthaanantaran ko radd karne ke liye prerit kiya jaataa tha
 In addition, at the time of renaming the file, Explorer used to display the file name without selecting the extension
 ekaadhik filon ko punarnamit karnaa ab shighrata se hota he kyonki teb ko dabaane se maujuuda fil yaa folder kaa namakaran swatah ho jaataa he or agali file ke liye naam badalane ke liye fil naam kaa paath kshetra khul jaataa he
 Pressing Shift + Tab allows renaming as above
 image mastering epiai ke sanskaran 2
0 kaa upyog karte hue sidi or dividi-ram ke alaava dividi par data ko bern karne ke liye sahaayta ko joda gaya
 When a file is in use by another application, Windows Explorer informs the user to close the application and retry the file operation
 iske alaava, epiai main ek nae interphes 'ifileisinuse' ko shuru kiya gaya jiskaa prayog karte hue developers anya anuprayogon ko us anuprayog ke mukhya windo main bhej sakate hai jisaki fil khuli hui he yaa ve "fil in yuz" dialog se us fil ko band kar sakate hai
 If the running application exposes these actions through the ifileinuse interface, the Windows Explorer allows the user to close the file when faced with a locked file, or from the dialog box to the application itself
 tulbaar par leout or batano ko anukulit karne kii kshamta ko vindos vista ke explorer se hataa diya gaya he, jaisaa ki pehle usamen ek jip fil main ek password jodne kii kshamta thi
 The toolbar button in Explorer has also been removed from which a folder was moved up or down from the current folder
 Although still available from menus and keyboard shortcuts, cut, copy, paste, undo, delete, properties toolbar buttons and some others are no longer available
 menu baar bhi ab difolt rup se chupa hua he, lekin Alt kunjee dabaane par abhi bhi uplabdh he, yaa leout vikalp main main uski drishyata badalane par
 kai anya suvidhaon ko hataa diya gaya he, jaise chizon ko bina chune hue states baar par aakaar ko dikhaanaa, metadata ko NTFS secondary stream main bhandaarit karnaa, aikolamprowider interfes jo explorer par anukulit khand jodne kii anumati detaa tha or desktop
ini kaa upyog karte hue folder prishthbhumi anukulan
 The option of "managing pairs of web pages and folders" has also been removed and the user has no way of telling Vista that a 
html file and a folder with the same name can be saved when saving an entire web page from IE What was created must be handled separately, that is, you cannot delete the folder without deleting the html file
 This is provided on a solution
 uske baad webpairs
reg fil ko registry main vilay kar diya gaya he, "managing peyars of web pejes and folders" kaa vikalp folder opshan ke vyuu teb main uplabdh he
 The ability to hit "search" by right clicking on a folder has been removed, as well as fields to be filled in to optimize your search
 ab aapako us folder ko hailit karnaa hoga jise aap khojna chaahate hai or khoj kshetra main upar dayee taraf apane khojshabd ko darj karnaa hoga or jab tak us ek khojshabd ke aadhaar par computer ne sampurna folder main apni khoj ko samaapt na kar liya ho aap koi anya khoj maapdand darj nahin kar sakate
 tabhi "adwanced search" batan pradarshit hoga or aapako aage ke khoj maapdandon ko pravesh karne kii ijaajat degaa
 is sthiti ko nazarandaaj kiya ja saktaa he
 The F3 key is hit in Windows Explorer
 isse "adwanced search" box saamne aata he
 Supports Windows Explorer libraries, in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2
 libraries aise abhaasi folders hai jinhen 
library-ms fil main varnit kiya gaya he jo vibhinn sthanon se saamagree samucchy karti he - jisamen shaamil he network system ke saajha folders yadi saajha folder ko mejabaan system dwaara anukramit kiya gaya he - or unhen ek ekikrut drishy main prastut karata he
 In addition to searching on local systems, searching in a library automatically associates queries with remote systems, so files on remote systems are also under search
 khoj folders ke vipareet, libraries ek bhautik avasthiti dwaara samarthit hoti hai jo filon ko librori main sahejane kii anumati detaa he
 Such files are transparently saved in the supporting physical folder
 librari ke liye difolt seve lokation ko ek upyogkarta dwaara vinyast kiya ja saktaa he or prayek librari ke liye difolt vyuu leout ko bhi
 libraries ko aam taur par libraries special folder main sangrahit kiya jaataa he, jo unhen nevigation pen par pradarshit hone kii anumati detaa he
 By default, a new user account in Windows 7 has four libraries for different file types: documents, music, pictures, and videos
 They are configured to include the user's profile folder for these related file types as well as the computer's associated public folders
 bhandaaran ke liye ekaadhik sthanon ke ekathran ke alaava, libraries, arrengement vus or search filter sajeshan ko sakasham karti hai
 Arrangement views allow you to view the contents of a library based on metadata
 udhaaharan ke liye, chitra librori main "bai manth" vyuu kaa chayan karne se chhaviyaan dher main pradarshit hongi, jahaan prayek dher ek maheene kii tasveeron ko us dinaank ke aadhaar par pradarshit karegaa jis din unhen khinchaa gaya tha
 In the Music Library, the "by Artist" view will present songs based on the artists in your collection, and searching in an artist's stack will display relevant albums
 search filter sajeshan windos 7 or vindos sarwar 2008 R2 explorer ke khoj box kii ek nai visheshta he
 When the user clicks into the search box, a menu appears below it that shows recent searches as well as a suggested advanced query syntax filter in which users can write
 jab ek kaa chunaav kiya jaataa he, to vah menu adhyatan rup se sambhavit maanon ko us gundharm ke liye dikhaata he or yah suchi vartmaan avasthiti or pehle se hi tip prashn ke anya bhaagon par aadhaarit hoti he
 For example, selecting the "tag" filter or typing "tag:" in the search box will display possible tag values that will return the search result
 arrengement vus or search filter sajeshns, database samarthit suvidhaayen hai jinke liye jaruri he ki librari main sabhi sthanon ko vindos search seva dwaara anukramit kiya jaae
 sthaneey discs sthaan ko sthaneey indexr dwaara anukramit kiya janaa chahie or jab unhen ek librari main shaamil kiya jayega to vindos explorer swatah anukraman gunjaaish ke liye sthanon ko jod degaa
 duurastha sthanon ko indexr dwaara anya windos 7 or vindos sarwar 2008 R2 mashin par, vindos search 4 chalaane vaale ek windos mashin par, yaa anya kisi upkaran par anukramit kiya ja saktaa he jo MS-WSP remote queri protocol ko lagu karata he
 Windows Explorer supports federated search for external data sources, such as custom databases, or web services that are exposed to the Web and described through the opensearch definition

 vindos explorer ko windos shell ekstansion, COM object jo vistaarit kaaryakshmata ko windos explorer main shaamil karte hai, ke madhyam se gaiyr-difolt kaaryakshmata kaa samarthan karne ke liye vistaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 Shell extensions can be in the form of shell extension handlers, toolbars, or namespace extensions that allow certain folders to be rendered as a special folder
 vindos XP tak kaa windos explorer filon ke liye metadata ko NTFS vaikalpik data stream ke rup main jodne kii anumati detaa he, jo fil ke liye data stream se alag hota he
 To modify the action taken by the shell, the shell already queries the shell extension handler
 unhen prati-fil prakaar ke aadhaar par sambhddha kiya ja saktaa he - jahaan ve tabhi dikhenge jab ek vishisht fil prakaar par koi khaas kriya hoti he - yaa ek vaishvik aadhaar par - jo hameshaa uplabdh hai
 This shell supports the following extension handlers: explorer dwaara nemaspes ekstansion kaa upyog kiya jaataa he yaa to kuch data ko pradarshit karne ke liye - jo filon ke rup main kaayam nahin hai - ek folder kii tarah ke drishy main yaa data ko is rup main prastut karnaa jo file system par unke sanghathan se alag he
 This feature can be used by relational file systems such as liquidfolders or Tabbles, unfortunate Microsoft winfs clones, specialized folders, such as My Computer and Network Places in Windows Explorer, implemented in this way and Explorer view in the same way
 Also, which make it eligible to be searched in mobile phone or digital camera
 strot niyantran system jo strot khajaane ko browz karne ke liye explorer kaa prayog karte hai, ve explorer ko sanshodhan browz karne kii anumati dene ke liye namasthaan ekstansion kaa upyog bhi karte hai
 To implement the namespace extension, the ipersistfolder, ishellview, ishellfolder, ishellbrowser and iolewindow interfaces need to be implemented and registered
 karyanvayan, data store ko nevigate karne ke saath-saath prastuti kaa varnan karne ke liye tark pradaan karata he
 Windows Explorer will illustrate COM objects as needed
 jabaki vindos explorer deshi rup se COM interfes ke rup main vistaarsheelataa ko ujagar karata he, ekstansion likhane ke liye 
net fremawork kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he, 
net fremawork kii COM interope kaaryakshmata kaa upyog karte hue
 jabaki khud microsoft ekstansion ko uplabdh karaata he - jaise photo info tul - jinka lekhan 
net fremawork ke istemaal se kiya jaataa he, ve vartmaan main prabandhit shell ekstansion likhane ke khilaaf sifarish karte hai, kyonki prati prakriya CLR keval ek udhaaharan ko lod kiya ja saktaa he
 This behavior will cause conflict if multiple managed add-ins targeting different versions of the CLR are attempted to run simultaneously
 windos 7 main bhi, explorer eenesai epiai kaa upyog karata he, isliye iskaa sanchaalan un margon tak simit he jisamen 260 se kam varna hai
 This limitation applies to certain operations, such as copying, transferring, or deleting files, but not simply accessing files by double-clicking
 Other Microsoft file tools, such as Robocopy, do not have such limitations

 Abiogenesis has been studied from the characteristics of modern organisms through a combination of paleontology, chemistry, and extrapolation, and to determine how the chemical reactions of earlier life gave rise to life on Earth

 In everyday terms, SCC is a very fluid mixture with a specific liquid footprint - it flows very easily in and around the outline, can flow through obstructions and surrounding corners, it can self-level Closer, it does not require tremors or perforation after application, and once set, the shape and surface texture are very visible as a result, as compared to standard concrete mums Sector SCC due to inserting No

 580px|thumb|territorial disputes in Europe The wikt: Antarctic Treaty System, formed on wikt: 1 December wikt: 1959 and entered into force on wikt: 23 June wikt: 1961, establishes the legal framework for the management of wikt: Antarctica and provides administration for the continent, which is carried out through consultative member meetings
 It freezes the territorial claims of all signatories for as long as the treaty is in force
 However, it is not a final settlement; parties can choose to withdraw from the System at any time
 Furthermore, only a minority of states have signed it, and it is not formally sanctioned by the wikt: United Nations
 Thus, Antarctica remains the only part of the planet any state can still lay claim to as wikt: terra nullius
 When the wikt:constitution of the Republic of China was adopted on wikt:25 December wikt:1947, the wikt:republic of China did recognize the statehood of the wikt:mongolian People's Republic with Soviet pressure
 After the wikt:un General Assembly Resolution 505 was passed in 1952, the Republic of China withdrew such a recognition in 1953 and therefore claimed wikt:greater Mongolia including wikt:outer Mongolia
 On wikt: 26 November wikt: 1993, the wikt: Judicial Yuan of the Republic of China in its Interpretation 328 called the constitutional territory beyond the reach of judicial review and thus avoided the question as whether Mongolia should be considered the constitutional territory of the Republic of China
 The Republic of China has once again recognized the statehood of wikt:mongolia in 2002, thus freezing the territorial claim, but as the Constitution of the Republic of China still mentions Mongolia in Article 119 that has not been superseded by the Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China, there are different opinions as to whether such a recognition is constitutional
 Despite these, the Yearbook of the Republic of China 2003 Version published by the wikt:government Information Office does claim Outer Mongolia

5% of the world's population live in an area disputed by two countries that are members of the wikt:united Nations
 This rises to around 25% when the areas and regions where territorial claims are made by two or more parties that do not recognize each other is included, although much of this comes from the wikt:republic of China's claim to wikt:mainland China

 a short but glorious life is written in the destiny of the heroic warrior Rujiyero and so a benevolent magician always tries to take him away from his fiancée, Bramanante
 bradamante chup na baith kar khud hi apane mangetar kii khoj main nikal padati he
 Just before the start of the opera, she saves Rujiyaro from a magical fortress, but as soon as she comes out of the fort, her flying horse flees with Rujiyero and lands on an island in the middle of the sea
 jaise hi udan-ghoda ek jhaadi ko khaanaa shuru karata he, rugineero us jhaadi ko bolta sun kar chakit rah jaataa he
 The bush tells her that she is in fact a warrior named Sir Astolfo who has been transformed into the mehndi plant by her island's master Mayawini sisters Alchina and Morgana
 rupavati jaaduugarani alchina apane dweep par pahunchne vaale sabhi purushon ko phuslaa kar apane prempash main band leti he, lekin phir jaldi hi apane aise premiyon se ub kar apni maaya se unhen pathar, pashuon, vrikshon yaa apni pasand kii anya kisi bhi vastu main parivartit kar detii he
 Despite Astolfo's warning, Rujiyero goes to meet Mayawini - and falls under his spell
 fir se apane premi kii talash karte hue bradamante rugineero ke purv shikshak meliso ke saath alchina ke tapu par pahunchati he
 Brahmaante looks like a man wearing a shield and pretends to be his own brother, Ricciardo
 uske or meliso ke paas ek jaadui anguthi hoti he jiskaa prayog kar ke ve donon alchina ke myjaal ko tod kar uske bandhakon ko chhudaane kii yojana banaate hai
 On the island, he first meets the magician Morgana
 maanviya bhaawanaaon or sachche prem kii samaj se rahit morgana rupwan 'richiardo' ko dekhte hi us par mohit ho jaati he or apane premi oronte kaa parityag kar detii he
 Morgana takes the new visitors to Alchina's court, where Brédamante is dismayed to see that Rujiyero has completely forgotten about his former life, albeit in Alchina's entourage
 alchina ke darbar main unki mulakaat ek balak oberto se bhi hoti he jo apane pita aastolfo, jise antim baar is tapu kii ore jate hue dekha gaya tha, kii khoj main niklaa he
 Bradamante realizes that Alastina and Morgana must have transformed Astolpho from their illusion into an animal or object, but she focuses her attention on saving Ruziero by remaining silent on the subject
 bradamante or meliso rugineero ko is tarah se mohandh ho jane ke liye fatkaarte hai, lekin alchina ke jaadu main bandhaa rugineero keval uske khayalon main duba rahata he
 Here Oronte learns that Morgana is enamored with Ricciardo and in a fit of rage to ditch Ricciardo in anger
 morgana is ladaai ko roak detii he, lekin oronte apana aavesh rugineero par utaarata he
 He tells her about how Alchina encounters her ex-lovers with her elusive power and says that she thinks Rujiyaro will soon have the same fate, as she suspects that Alchina is bored with Rujiyaro and is fascinated by Ricciardo
 has occurred
 rugineero yah sunakar stabdh rah jaataa he or krodhit ho kar alchina ke paas jaataa he
 The situation worsens even further when Ricciardo comes there pretending to love Alchina
 alchina rugineero ko shant karti he, lekin bradamante alchina ko is tarah apane magetar se prem main dekhakar vihval ho jaati he or rugineero ko apni asli pahchaan kaa bhed bataa detii he
 Meliso fears that Rujiyero will reveal this distinction to Alaina and he immediately refutes Bramamante
 aise virodhabhashi kathan sun kar rugineero bhramit ho jaataa he
 Alchina tells Morgana that she will turn Ricciardo into an animal to show Rujiero that she loves him and not Ricciardo
 richiardo par aasakt morgana yah sunakar bhaybheet ho jaati he or richiardo ko alchina kii maaya se bachaane ke liye use tapu se bhaag jane ke liye kahati he; parantu richiardo kahata he ki vah tapu par hi rahegaa kyonki vah kisi or se prem karata he
 Hearing this, Morgana is happy to believe that Ricciardo is in love with her, and the issue ends with Tornami and Vágéza, Morgana's cheerful voice
 rugineero ko alchina ke jaadu se mukt karne ke liye meliso use apni jaadui anguthi pahanaataa he
 With the effect of the ring, Ruziero frees Alachina from the fallacy on the island and sees the island in its true form - a desert full of demons
 stambhit rugineero samaj jaataa he ki use zaldi hi tapu ko chhodana hoga or vah prasiddh bhav-gaan verdi praati gaata he, jisamen vah swikar karata he ki vah jivan bhar alchina or uske tapu kii mohak sundarata ko bhul nahin paayegaa, yah jaanane ke baad bhi yah sundarata keval ek mayavi bhram thi
 Meliso warns Rujiyaro that it will not be easy to get out of the island of an enchanted witch like Alchina and asks her to use deception
 vah rugineero ko yah suzav detaa he ki vah alchina se shikaar par jane kii anumati le kar apni tapu ko chhodane kii yojana ko chhupaae
 Rujiyaro accepts this suggestion, but he is so frustrated by Alchina's illusion by now that when Bradamante appears to him in his true form, he refuses to consider him as a Bachmante, considering him another Marichika composed by Alchina gives
 rugineero kii upeksha se alchina or bradamante donon hi niraash ho jaati hai
 Alchina appears there to give proof of his love to Rujiyaro and begins to transform Ricciardo into an animal
 richiardo ko is gambhir sankat main dekh rugineero shighrata se apni bhaawanaaon par niyantran karata he or alchina ko vishwaas dilaataa he ki use alchina ke prem ke kisi pramaan kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 At this point, the audience learns that Alchina really loves Rujiyero
 idhar oronte ko shaq ho jaataa he ki richiardo, meliso or rugiero milakar koi yojana bana rahe hai or morgana or alchina ko bhi abhas ho jaataa he ki unke saath chal kiy ja rahaa he
 But by now it is too late: the source of Alchina's power is deceit and misconception and as soon as true love comes into her life, her illusion starts to weaken
 is ank ke ant main alchina dushtatmaon kaa awahn kar rugineero ko rokane kii koshish karti he, par rugineero ke prati uske sachche prem ke kaaran uski mayavi shaktiyaan nishphal ho jaati hai
 Morgana again approaches him with a desire to connect with Oronte
 oronte use jhidak detaa he; parantu morgana ke dur jate hi sweekaar karata he ki vah abhi bhi morgana se prem karata he
 Rujiyaro regains his temperamental self again and sings a sentiment with high horns
 alchina oberto ko ek singh se milaati he or use singh kaa vadh karne kii ajna detii he
 Oberto experiences a strange relationship with the lion and refuses to obey Alchina
 vah samaj jaataa he ki yah singh avashya hi uskaa pita he, jise alchina ne apni maaya se pashu-rup main parivartit kar diya he
 Brdamante and Rujiyero decide to destroy the source of the Maya of Alchina and Morgana, which is represented here as a vase
 alchina unase aisa nahin karne kii prarthana karti he, lekin rugineero uske agrahon kaa tiraskaar kar maaya-kalash ko nasht kar detaa he
 As soon as he does this, all around, destruction and rebuilding start simultaneously
 alchina kaa maaya-mahal dhwast ho jaataa he or mayavini bahanen alchina or morgana dharti main samaa jaati hai
 Many of her old lovers, transformed by the power of her magic, return to their true form: the lion shown to Alberina by Oberto turns into her father, Aastolfo
 alchina or morgana ke mayajaal se chute kai anya purush un jaaduugarani bahanon dwaara unhen di gai mayavi pratadna kaa varnan karte hai: un donon ne apane jaadu se kisi ko shila, kisi ko vriksh or kisi ko to keval ek samudri lahar main badal diya tha
 All humans forget Alchina and Morgana and celebrate their liberation and happiness

 prayek vyakti main kuch vishesh gun yaa visheshtaayen hoti ho jo duusare vyakti main nahin hotin
 It is because of these qualities and characteristics that each person differs from each other
 vyakti ke in gunon kaa samucchy hi vyakti kaa vyaktitv kehalaata he
 Personality, rather than a static state, is a dynamic society that influences the environment and that is why it can change
 vyakti ke aachaar-vichaar, vyavhaar, kriyaayein or gatividhiyon main vyakti kaa vyaktitv jhalkata he
 All behavior of a person is to adjust to his environment or environment
 jansadharan main vyaktitv kaa arth vyakti ke bahya rup se liya jaataa he, parantu manovigyaan main vyaktitv kaa arth vyakti ke rup gunon kii samashthi se he, arthath vyakti ke bahya aavaran ke gun or aantarik tatv, donon ko mana jaataa he
 Psychologists, philosophers and sociologists have given various definitions keeping various aspects of the person in mind
 is tarah vyaktitv kii saikadon paribhaashaayen di ja chuki hai
 For convenience, Guilford has divided these definitions into four categories, which are as follows: uparokt virgon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue vyaktitv kii paribhaashaayen is prakaar di ja sakati hai- This class contains definitions that take into account the entire set of responses, reactions and biological properties of a person
 isamen kemff tathaa marton prince kii paribhaashaayen mahatvapurn hai
 According to camph marton prince ke anusaar, According to, is varg kii paribhaashaon main vyaktitv ke vibhinn roopon, gunon evam tatwon ke yoga par bal diya jaataa he
 The integration of these qualities creates a characteristic in the individual
 is varg kii paribhaashaon main warren tathaa karmical tathaa mechardi kii paribhaashaayen ullekhneey hai
 According to Warren and Carmichael, mechardi ke shabdon main, Some psychologists, such as Willian Jams and Maslow, have described many strings of personality
 in manovaigyanikon ne mukhya rup se vyaktitv ke chaar sopan maane hai- Under the first step, a person's body design includes special properties derived from heredity, while the second step mentions social relationships and social development
 vyaktitv kaa teesraa sopan jaimus ne aadhyatmik vyaktitv mana he
 According to him, the person with this step is interested in spiritual matters and he gives more importance to it than social relations
 ab uske aadhyatmik vyaktitv kaa vikaas hone lagata he
 In the fourth step, one becomes fully aware of his self-nature and sees his soul in all things and then he reaches the last step of his personality
 shri aravind ne bhi vyakti vikaas ke kram main kareeb-kareeb isi prakaar ke vichaar prakat kiyehain
 He mentions physical, emotional or pranic, intellectual, chaitya, spiritual and very mental steps
 is varg kii paribhaashaon main manovaigyanik vyakti ke vyaktitv ke adhyayan tathavyakhya main samaayojan ko mahatvapurn maanate hai
 This class contains definitions in which the greatest emphasis is on adjustment
 vyakti main aise gun jo usko samyojit karne main uski sahaayta karte hon, chaahe ve shaareerik hon yaa maansik un sab kaa gathan is prakaar kaa hota he ki ve nirantar gatisheel rahete hai
 Due to the dynamicness of these qualities, a special kind of exclusivity or incomparability arises in a person
 boring ke anusaar, The above definitions are partial in defining a person's personality as a whole
 kisi vyakti kaa chaahe kitne hi maansik yaa shaareerik gunon kaa yoga ho, kitna hi chintansheel yaa gyani ho, parantu uske vyavhaar main gatishiltaa na hone par uskaa vyavhaar or samaayojan adhuraa rah jaataa he
 With this in mind, Alport made a full and successful attempt to make the definition of personality acceptable by expressing his views
 uski paribhaashaayen adhikansh manovaigyanikon dwaara purna paribhaasha ke rup main sweekaar kii gayi hai
 Therefore, the definition of allport is important in the definitions of this class
 alport ke anusaar, Certain elements play a role in influencing personality
 We call them 'determinants of personality'
 ye hi tatv milakar vyaktitv ko purna banane main sahyog dete hai
 Personality develops according to these elements
 kuch vidwaanon ne vyaktitv ke nirdhaaran main jaivik aadhaar ko pramukh mana he to kuch ne paryaavaran sambandhi aadhaar ko pradhanta di he, parantu vyaktitv ke vikaas main in donon nirdharakon kaa haath rahata he
 The biological determinants are the following four: - paryaavaran sambandhi nirdharak teen hai- Some traits in a personality are ancestral or genetic
 sharir kaa rang, rup, sharir kii banaavat gunon se yukt ho sakate hai
 The reason for this is the chromosomes of the parents received by the child
 balak kii anuvaanshikta main keval uske mata-pita kii dein hi nahin hoti
 Half of the heredity of the child comes from parents, one fourth from grandparents, maternal grandparents and eighth from great grandfather and other ancestors
 atah balak ke vyaktitv par paitruk gunon kaa prabhaav padataa he
 His appearance or physical formation qualities may correspond to his mother or father or to his grandfather or grandmother
 isi tarah usamen buddhi evam maansik kshamtaaon ke gun apane purvajon ke anuroop ho sakate hai
 It has been observed in many studies that the properties of mental illnesses of ancestors can be manifested in anyone of their generation
 is tarah ham dekhte ho ki paitruk gunon kaa vyakti ke vyaktitv gathan par kam yaa zyada prabhaav padataa he
 Under the physical formation, the length, texture, color, hair, eyes and nose map etc
 of a person are calculated
 ye shaareerik visheshtaayen itani spasht hoti ho ki bahut se log inhen se vyakti kaa bodh karte hai
 Although this approach is not good, these characteristics are definitely indicative of personality
 sharir se hrisht-pusht or sundar vyakti ko dekhakar log prabhavit hote hai
 They praise the formation of his body
 isse us vyakti ke maansik pahalu par prashansa kaa prabhaav aisa padataa he ki dusron kii apeksha vah apane ko shreshth samajhane lagata he or usamen aatmavishvaas or swavlamban ke bhav paidaa ho jate hai
 Inability of the person to develop and physical disabilities leads to inferiority complex
 vah apneapako gaya-beetaa va hin samajhataa he or usamen aatmavishvaas kii kami ho sakati he, vah apane kaary kii safalataa main sadaa ashankit rahata he or abhaav kii purti ke liye vah asaamaajik vyavhaar ko apana saktaa he
 Health also has an impact on personality development
 jo vyakti shaareerik rup se swasth rahata he vah acha saamaajik jivan vyateet karata he or usamen saamaajikta viksit hoti he
 a healthy person achieves his purpose by completing his work successfully on time
 iske thik vipareet aswasth vyakti kaa vyaktitv adhuraa rah jaataa he
 Due to illness, he is unable to complete his tasks on time, so that he cannot achieve his goal on time
 usamen kaary karne kii ruchi bhi kam rahati he
 Unhealthy person cannot even influence others
 is tarah, vyaktitv par shaareerik gathan or swasthya kaa kaaphi prabhaav padataa he
 The endocrine glands have a great influence in the development of personality
 ye prayek manushya ke sharir main paayi jaati hai
 These glands are also called 'ductless glands'
 ye bina nalikaaon ke sharir main srav bhejti hai
 Their secretions are called Nyasar or hormones
 vibhinn granthiyaan ek yaa ek se adhik hormones kaa srav karti hai
 These glands are mainly 8
 ye hai- Apart from the endocrine glands and anatomy, physical chemistry is also important to be mentioned in the biological factors of personality
 pracheen kaal se manushya ke swabhaav kaa kaaran uske sharir ke rasayan ke tatwon ko bhi mana gaya he
 About 400 years before Christ, the famous physician and thinker Hippocrates of Greece has depicted the nature of a person on the basis of the chemicals found in the body
 lagbhag is prakaar kaa varnan ayurveda main bhi kiya he
 These physical chemicals are of four types
 rakt kii adhikta se vyakti adatan ashaavadi or utsaahi hota he
 People with excess bile are irritable or irritable in nature
 jis vyakti main kaph athwa shleshma kii pradhanta hoti he ve shant va aalsee hote hai
 Such a person is called mucosal nature
 jis vyakti main tilli dravya yaa shyaam pitt kii pradhanta hoti he
 Hippocrates has described personality types on the basis of such people being depressed
 uparokt jaivik karkon ke atirikt kuch anya jaivik kaarak bhi ho jo vyaktitv ko prabhavit karte ho, ye kaarkhai- buddhi, rangarup ling 
 Man lives in the natural environment, geographical conditions and climate have an impact on his life and personality
 bhugolic paristhitiyon or jalwaayu kaa uske swasthya, sharir kii banaavat tathaa maansik sthitiyon par prabhaav padataa he
 For example, people living in cold climate have a fair complexion while those living in hot climate are dark colored
 bhugolic paristhitiyon kaa bhi shaareerik gathan par prabhavapadta he jaise pahari logon kaa shaareerik gathan
 People in places where earthquakes or natural disasters are more likely to have less sense of security
 yadi vyakti kii bhugolic paristhitiyaan yaa jalwaayu badal di jaye tab unke vyaktitv main bhi parivartan aa jaataa he
 For example, if people living in a warm state are kept in a cold state, their working abilities may decrease and health can be adversely affected
 isi tarah thande pradesh main rahane vaale vyaktiyon ko yadi ooshna pradesh main rakhaa jaae to aisa hi prabhaav un logon par padataa he
 The person is a social animal and also the unit of society
 janm se lekar mrityu paryant vah samaaj main rahata he
 Therefore, the society, the structure of society and the people of society have a great influence on it
 parivaar ke logon se lekar samaaj ke logon tak kaa vyakti ke vyaktitv par kis prakaar prabhaav padataa he Lack of love of parents has the same effect on all children as it is the child's innate nature and tendencies
 mata-pita ke prem kii avhelnaa or taadna se ek balak dabbu ban saktaa he parantu doosraa balak dabang or uddand ban saktaa he
 According to Alport, "the fire that melts butter makes the eggs hard
" ’’ mata-pita dwaara bachche ko jhidakna or god main na lenaa bhi uske vyaktitv ko prabhavit karata he
 If there are criminal tendencies among the family members then it also affects the development of the personality of the child, and criminal tendencies are also born in the child and later on the child starts committing social crime
 isi prakaar bhagn parivaar bhi kishor aparaadh kaa mukhya kaaran he
 There is no evidence that this style of childhood remains unchanged for a lifetime
 balak ke vyaktitv vikaas par vidhyalay, vidhyalay main hone vaale adhyayan, vidhyalay ke shikshak, balak ke sahpaathee tathaa vidhyalay kii bhugolic sthiti kaa bahut prabhaav padataa he
 Effect of Methodology - The type of education imparted in the school has an impact on the personality of the child
 kai vidyalayon main dharmikata, kattardharmikata kii shiksha di jaati he isse balak ke vyaktitv kaa vikaas sankirnan or ek nishchit dharm kii taraf hota he
 This makes the child jealous and spiteful towards other religions
 kai angreji bhashaa ke vidyalayon main balak ko maatrubhaasha yaa anya bhashaaen bolne nahin di jaati, balki keval angreji bhashaa hi bolne ko baadhya kiya jaataa he, aisi sthiti main balak par maansik dabaav bad jaataa he tathaa usamen niraashaa evam kunthaayen utpann ho jaati he, jisase aage chalakar balak ke vyaktitv vikaas main tathaa samaayojan main baadha aati he
 Many schools do not offer balanced education
 aaj kii shiksha pranali main yah sabase bada dosha he
 Proper attention is not paid to the mental and physical development of the child, but attention is given to how many books of his curriculum should be increased
 balak ke baste kaa boj, grih kaary kii maar balak ke sarvangin vikaas main baadhak banati he
 And balanced and ethical education should be imparted in the school for its balanced personality development, all round development and development of values
 praayogic aadhaarit shiksha mulya-parak shiksha, anekaant dharmik shiksha tathaa shaareerik vikaas kii shiksha bhi balak ke vyaktitv ke vikaas main bahut sahaayak hoti he
 Influence of teachers - Just as a child identifies with the mother or father in the family, in the same way, in the school also, he identifies with the teachers
 yadi shikshak kaa vyaktitv prabhaavshaalee ho to balak ke vyaktitv vikaas par uskaa anukool prabhaav padataa he
 Sometimes the child learns the negative qualities of teachers
 shikshakon dwaara baalkon se bidi, cigarette mangavaana or unki upasthiti main unka prayog karnaa ghaatak he kyonki iskaa tadaamya kar balak bidi, cigarette pinaa sikh jaataa he
 If the teachers have good qualities, then the child also recognizes those qualities, as a result those qualities are added to the child's personality development
 sankshep main aamtaur se balak ke prati vyavhaar main prakat hone vaale shikshak ke vyaktitv ke sabhi gun-dosha balak ke vyaktitv vikaas par acha-bura prabhaav daalate hai
 Influence of classmates - The personality development of a child has a great influence on his classmates or schoolmates
 vidhyalay main usko sabhi prakaar ke saathiyon ke saath rahanaa padataa he
 Many classmates differ from him in age, many affectionate students and many unkind students also accompany him
 in sabhi saathiyon ke saath balak apni vidhyalay kii dincharya vyateet karata he
 a student of younger age or younger class is older than a student
 yah dabana adarsh suchak bhi ho saktaa he or bhay suchak bhi
 Therefore, these factors affect the personality of the child
 kai baar balak abhadra baalkon ke vyavhaaron ko sikh jaataa he jisamen gaali-galoch, vidhyalay se bhaagane, shikshakon tathaa mata-pita ke saath abhadra vyavhaar karnaa sikh jaataa he, jo uske vyaktitv ke vikaas ko prabhavit karata he
 Classmates have the most influence on the personality of the child as the influence of the sports group
 vidhyalay main saath-saath khilne vaale yaa pratiyogita karne vaale vidhyaarthee apana-apana balak kaa jis samskruti ke parivesh main vikaas hota he us samskruti ke khan-paan, rahan-sahan, reeti-rivaaj, dharm, parampara, vivaah, saamaajik samaaroh or saamaajik sansthaaon aadi kaa prabhaav padataa he
 There are also huge variations in the culture of tribes
 jaise naga log siron ke shikari he tathaa bhil ladaaku he or santhal sidhe-saadhe hai
 In this way social structure, social conditions, social work and rules codes affect the personality of a human being in a cultural environment
 kahin-kahin chaatr dal bana lete hai or dal ke netritv ke liye netaa kaa chunaav bhi karte hai
 In this way, the student team works differently to conduct various activities which is helpful in its personality development
 apane saathiyon ke saath main pratiyogita or pratidwandvita rakhane se balak parishram karata he jo uske vyaktitv vikaas main sahaayak hota he
 Geographical location of the school - How is the geographical location of the school, it also affects the development of the personality of the child
 vidhyalay kahaan sthit he tathaa vidhyalay bhawan kii kya sthiti he, iskaa bhi prabhaav balak ke vyaktitv vikaas par padataa he
 If the school is located in a pollution-prone place where there is air pollution and noise pollution, the health of the children studying in such a school can be adversely affected
 yadi vidhyalay aise mohalle main sthit he jahaan samaaj kantak jaise sharaabi, juaari, veshyavriti karne vaale or chori karne vaale rahete ho to aise kshetra ke vidyalayon main padhane vaale chaatronke vyaktitv vikaas par bura prabhaav padegaa
 In this, the child can learn anti-social behavior
 yadi vidhyalay kaa bhawan svachh nahin he or jeern-sheern or khandahar avasthaa main he to us sthaan par padhane vaale baalkon ke vyaktitv ke vikaas par bura prabhaav padataa he
 There is a fear of the building collapsing in their mind all the time and other diseases may arise in them which impede their personality development
 jaisaa ki purv main likhaa ja chukaa he ki vyakti samaaj kaa ang or ikai he
 Therefore, it is natural for society to have an impact on personality development
 samaaj kii paramparaon reeti-rivaajon, saamaajik niyamon kaa vyakti ke vyaktitv ke vikaas par vyapak prabhaav padataa he
 One adopts the norms and norms of the people of the society
 jati, varna tathaa vyavsaay ke anusaar prayek vyakti kii samaaj main sthiti alag-alag hoti he
 The social status of the family also affects the personality of the children
 varnbhed jaise brahman, kshatriya, vaisya, shudra tathaa jatibhed arthath vibhinn jatiyon kii saamaajik sthitiyaan bhinn-bhinn hai
 Some people are in favor of caste-system, curtain-system, child marriage, and some are extremely opposed
 kuch log samaaj ke prayek niyam ko todane ko tatpar dikhaai dete ho jabaki kuch log unka kathorta se paalan karte dikhaai padate hai
 a sense of nobility can be seen among the upper caste children and inferiority among the lower castes
 oonche gharaanon ke baalkon kaa vyaktitv sanyamit dikhaai padataa he parantu iske liye koi thos manovaigyanik pramaan nahin he
 Social reformers, social workers and anti-social persons also have an influence on the development of the personality of the child
 samaaj sudhaarak, samaaj sevi tathaa saamaajik kaaryakrtta samaaj ke kalyaan tathaa samaaj ke utthan ke liye kaary karte hai or inkaa prabhaav baalkon ke vyaktitv vikaas par padataa he
 Similarly, anti-social work and social factors also have an impact on personality development
 samaaj virdohi log, samaaj virdohi kaary jaise jebkatri, chori, sharabkhori, veshyavriti aadi kaaryon ko karte ho or inkaa prabhaav baalkon ke vyaktitv vikaas par padataa he
 Social workers serve various people of the society like old, destitute, poor and try to protect the society
 unki paropkaaree seva bhaawanaaon kaa bhi prabhaav anya vyaktiyon ke vyaktitv vikaas par padataa he
 Other individuals can also develop their personality positively by adopting altruistic feelings
 vyakti ke vyaktitv ke vikaas par samskruti kii ahm bhoomika he
 Person's personality is in line with culture
 janmkaal se hi shishu kaa paalan-poshan tathaa samajikaran uski saanskrithik parampara ke anuroop hota he
 Every culture has a method of socialization of the infant because through this method the culture protects itself
 samskruti or vyaktitv ek duusare ke poorak hote hai
 Most of today's psychologists think that culture and personality are not two different things, but two aspects of the same object
 jis samskruti main balak kaa laalan-paalan hota he usee samskruti ke gun uske vyaktitv main aa jate hai
 In the words of mcivor and Page, "culture is an expression of our nature in our ways of living and thinking, in daily activities, in art, in literature, in religion, in entertainment and pleasure
" ’’ is tarah samskruti kaary karne kii shaileyon, mulyon, bhavatmak lagaavon or bauddhik abhiyaan kaa kshetra he
 a culture differs from another culture on the basis of these qualities
 alag-alag samskritiyon ke alag-alag mulya hote hai
 As in ancient times, Indian people were pious and spiritual
 aadhunik bhartiya utane aadhyatmik evam dharmik nahin hai
 Nevertheless, they have high spiritual and religious values
 iskaa kaaran bhartiya samskruti kaa prabhaav hi he
 Physical and mental values are of a high level for Western people
 isi tarah alag-alag samskruti ke samaajon main rahan-sahan, reeti-rivaaj, dharm, kala, mulyon or paramparaon main bhinnataayen dekhi ja sakati hai
 In some cultures, humans consider killing as a sin, on the other hand, in the Naga culture, there is a great respect for those who bring a male fowl
 jo vyakti jitne zyada nar mund katata he utani hi samaaj main uski pratishtha badhati he or utane hi zyada striyon ke vivaah ke prastaav aate hai
 Whereas in other cultures people of the society do not want to marry their daughter with a male murderer
 bhartiya samskruti ke kuch pariwaron main talaak dena acha nahin mana jaataa parantu kuch janajatiyon main jo stri jitne adhik talaak paati he, uski pratishtha utani hi adhik badhati he
 Divorce is not considered bad in Western countries
 kuch samaaj main kunari kanya ke garbhvatee ho jane par koi usase vivaah nahin karata, parantu kuch jan-jatiyon main vivaah se pehle santanotpatti karnaa ladki ke vivaah main sahaayak hota he
 Such cultural differences affect the personality development of the child sharma ek hindu brahman upnaam hota he
 In physics, angular momentum, moment moment or rotational momentum is the measurement of the value of an object's rotation, taking into account its mass, shape, and velocity
 yah ek sadish raashi he jo kisi vishesh aksh ke saapeksh jadtwaghurna va koniya veg ke guna ke baraabar hota he
 The angular momentum of a body of particles is equal to the sum of the angular momentum of all particles present in that body
 kisi bindu ke saapeksh kisi 'kan' kaa koniya samveg ko sadish gunanfal ke rup main is prakaar abhivyakt kiya ja saktaa he- Where r { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {r}} is the position vector of that particle relative to that point
 kisi aksh ke saapeksh kisi kan kaa koniya samveg us aksh se kan tak ke lambavat sadish or us kan ke raikhik samveg ke sadish gunanfal ke baraabar hota he
 Note that the value of the angular momentum depends on the choice of the axis, while the value of the linear momentum has nothing to do with the choice of the axis
 kisi bindu ke saapeksh kisi pind kaa koniya samveg us bindu ke saapeksh us pind ke sabhi kanon ke koniya samveg ke sadish yoga ke baraabar hota he
 The angular momentum of a moving body relative to an axis is equal to the inertia of that body relative to that axis and the product of its angular velocity

 jis din pradosh va ardharatri main chaturdashi ho, vah ati punyadayini kahi gai he
 This time on 6 March, Shivratri will be present in both Pradosh and Ardharatri
 ishan samhita ke anusaar is din jyotirlig kaa pradurbhaav hua, jisase shaktiswaroopa parvati ne maanvi sristi kaa maarg prashast kiya
 The reason behind celebrating Mahashivaratri to Falgun Krishna Chaturdashi is that on this day supernatural lyrical powers come to the Earth through the decaying moon, which increases the vitality

 He was married to Ann Hathaway in 1582

 He initially worked on a small job in a theater, but a few days later he became a member of Lord Chamberlain's company and took part in acting in London's premier theaters

 In 1597, he gradually renovated and expanded
 isi bhawan main san 1610 ke baad ve apana adhikadhik samay vyateet karne lage or vahiin san 1616 main unka dehanth hua
 There is considerable disagreement as to the date of the works of Shakespeare
 san 1930 main prasiddh vidvan sar i
ke
 chambers ne tithikram kii jo talika prastut kii vah aaj praaia: sarvamaanya he
 Nevertheless, the discovery of previous years has led to some new assumptions regarding dates
 in nai khojon ke aadhaar par mike manve mahoday ne ek naveen talika taiyaar kii he jo sar i

 Shakespeare's prolific talent continued to develop over the course of nearly 20 years of literary life
 saamaanya rup se is vikascram main chaar vibhinn avasthaaen dikhaai detii he
 The initial phase ended in 1595
 is kaal kii praaia: sabhi rachanaayen prayogtmak he
 Shakespeare had not yet been able to determine his path, and was therefore progressively implementing his various compositions, in the prolific style of the ancient comical plays, 'the Comedy of Errors' and 'the Taming of the Sou'
 Created taduparant 'loves lebers lost' main inhone lily ke darbari sukhaant naatakon kii paripati apanaai
 It has an atmosphere of court which is full of interesting dialogue of clever characters
 'di tu jentilmen ov verona' main green ke svachhndathawadi sukhaant naatakon kaa anukaran kiya gaya he
 Sad dramas are also imitative
 'richard tritiy' main maalon kaa tathaa 'titus andranicus' main kid kaa anukaran kiya gaya he kintu 'romeo and juliet' main moulikta kaa ansh apekshaakrit adhik he
 Both the famous poems written in the same period 'the Rape of Lucreis' and 'venus and Adonis' have the imprint of the erstwhile Italian lovemaking
 vikascram kii duusari avasthaa san 1600 main samaapt hui
 In this, Shakespeare presented many mature works to the world
 ab unhone apana maarg nirdhaarit tathaa aatmavishvaas arjeet kar liya tha
 'A Mid Summer Nights Dream' and 'the Merchant on Venice' are interesting and popular melodramas but even more important are Shakepeare's quintessential pleasures such as Much Ado About Nothing, 'as You Like It' and 'twelve Night'
 Written in time
 in naatakon main kavi kii kalpana tathaa uske man ke ahlad kaa uttam prakaashan hua he
 The best historical plays were also written at this time
 marlo se prabhavit 'richard dwitiya' usee shrenee kii purvavarti kriti 'richard tritiy' se rachanavinyas main kahin adhik safal he
 Both the parts of 'henry IV' and 'henry V' which are well known historical dramas, are compositions of this period
 shakespeare ke praaia: sabhi sonet jo apni utkrisht abhivyakti ke liye anupam hai, san 1595 ore 1607 ke bich likhe gaye
 The third stage, which ended in about 1607, holds special significance in Shakespeare's life
 in varshon main paariwarik vipatti evam swasthya kii kharabi ke kaaran kavi kaa man avasann tha
 Hence, most of the compositions of these days are sad
 vishwaprasiddh du:khant naatak hamelet, othelo, king lier or makebeth evam roman du:khant naatak julius sijar, 'antony and cleopatra' evam 'coriolenus' isi kalavadhi main likhe gaye or abhinit hue
 'trivialus and Cressida', 'all's well that ends well' and 'major for Major' have a mixed expression of happiness and grief, even then only the tragic part is predominant
 vikaas kii antim avasthaa main shakespeare ne pericules, sinvilin, 'di winters tail', 'di tempast' prabhruti naatakon kaa sarjan kiya, jo sukhaant hone par bhi du:khad sambhaavnaaon se bhare hai evam ek sandhya vaataavaran kii sristi karte hai
 These joyous sorrow plays are termed as romance or Shakespeare's last plays
 shakespeare ke sukhaant naatakon kii apni nijee visheshtaayen hai
 Although Platus is followed in 'the Comedy of Errors', other pleasant dramas are completely different from the ancient classical plays
 inkaa uddeshy prahasan dwaara kurupataaon kaa mitaanaa tathaa trutiyon kaa sudhaar karnaa nahin varan rochak katha or charitrachitran dwaara logon kaa manoranjan karnaa he
 The theme of almost all such plays is such intense feeling of love that spontaneously arises in the minds of young men and women
 premi janon ke maarg main pehle to baadhaayen utpann hoti hai kintu naatak ke ant tak kathinaaiyaan vinasht ho jaati hai or unka parinaam sampann hota he
 In these compositions, there is a poetic and imaginative expression of life and the whole atmosphere is full of joy
 shakespeare kaa parichay katipay ucchwargeey pariwaron se ho gaya tha or unamem jis prakaar kaa jivan unhone dekha usee kaa prakaashan in naatakon main kiya he
 The grief plays highlight the serious problems of human life
 in naatakon ke abhijaat kulotpann nayak kuch samay tak safalataa or unnati ke maarg par agrasar hone ke uparaant yatnaa or vinaash ke shikaar banate hai
 Shakespeare's opinion on the subject of what causes his grief and death is clearly expressed
 nayak kaa durbhaagya anshat: pratikul niyati evam paristhitiyon se udbhoot he, kintu isse kahin bada kaaran uski charitrik durbalata main miltaa he
 In ancient Greek tragedies, the protagonist was only decimated by faulty judgment or flawed attitudes, but, perhaps influenced by Christianity and moralism, Shakespeare placed the principal responsibility for the hero's downfall on his character in his plays
 hamelet, athelo, lier or makebeth - in sabhi ke swabhaav athwa charitra main aisi kami milti he jo unke ksht evam mrityu kaa kaaran banati he
 In these sad plays, dual duality is reflected, internal duality and multi-duality
 aantarik dwandv nayak ke man main, uske vichaaron or bhaawanaaon main utpann hota he or apni tivrata ke kaaran na keval nirnay kathin bana detaa he apitu kuch samay ke liye nayak kaa asul vichlit bhi kar detaa he
 This type of internal duality has led to the emergence of psychological subtlety and interestingness in plays
 bahya dwandv bahari shaktiyon kii spardhaa or unke sangharsh se utpann hota he, jaise do virdohi raajnneetik dalon athwa senaaon kaa parsparik virodh
 In Shakespeare's major grief plays, the atmosphere of bloodshed and horrific scenes has created a very terror environment
 isi bhanti hatya or pratishodh sambandhi drishyon ke samavesh se bhi avsaad kaa put gaharaa ho gaya he
 Shakespeare took all these features and instruments from certain old plays and playwrights such as Seneca, Kid, Marlow, and used them in his plays, keeping in mind the occasional public interest
 du:khant naatakon kii jin visheshtaon kaa ullekh hamane yahan kiya he ve na keval hamelet, athelo, king lier, or makebeth main milti hai varan romeo and juliet tathaa england or rome ke itihaas par aadhrut du:khant naatakon main bhi aanshik rup main vidyaman hai
 Many of the historical plays that Shakespeare composed are Roman historians
 in roman naatakon ke lekhan main shakespeare ne itihaas ke tathyon ko thodaa bahut badal diya he or katipay sthalon par aisa prathit hone lagata he ki jivan kaa jo chitra upasthit kiya gaya he vah pracheen rome kaa nahin apitu alizveth kaaleen england kaa he
 Despite this, these plays have always been popular, especially Julius Caesar and Antoine & Cleopatra
 antony aid cleopatra kavitvapurn anshon sa bharaa padaa he tathaa cleopatra kii charitrakalpana atyant prabhavotpadak he
 The events of Greek history are represented in the Times of Athens and Perikiles
 angreji itihaas par aadhaarit naatakon main kuch to aise hai jo keval aanshik rup main shakespeare dwaara likhe gaye hai kintu henry chaturth ke donon bhaag or henry pancham purna roopen shakespeare dwaara pranit hai
 The poet has achieved great success in these three plays
 inamen shaury or sammanbhaavna kaa atyant aakarshak pratipaadan hua he or phalstaff kaa charitra atyant rochak evam spruhaniya hai
 Marlow has been successfully imitated in Richard III and Richard II
 shakespeare ke purv ke adhikansh angreji aitihaasik naatakon main tathyon or ghatnaon kaa nirjeev chithran rahata tha tathaa kori itivrittatmakataa ke kaaran ve neeras hote the
 Shakespeare has made these types of plays come alive by making them miraculous
 antim naatakon main shakespeare kaa paripakv jeevandarshan miltaa he
