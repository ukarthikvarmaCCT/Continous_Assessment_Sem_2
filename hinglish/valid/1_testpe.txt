 Inside it is a mosque which has a two-tier octagonal column
 hindu sahitya ke anusaar yah kila indraprastha ke sthal par he jo pandavon kii vishaal rajdhani hoti thi
 While it was built between 1538 and 1545 by the Afghan ruler Sher Shah Suri, who seized the throne of Delhi from the Mughal emperor Humayun
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki mughal badshaah humayun kii is kile ke ek se neeche girane ke kaaran durghatanavash mrityu ho gai
 It is said that Delhi was first settled by the Pandavas as their capital Indraprastha, that too 1400 years before BC, but there is no firm evidence for this
 aaj dikh rahe puraane kile ke dakshin purvi bhaag main san 1955 main pareekshan ke liye kuch khandak khode gaye the or jo mitti ke paatro ke tukade aadi paae gaye ve mahabharat kii katha se jude anya sthalon se praapt pura vastuon se mail khate the jisase is puraane kile ke bhubhag ko indraprastha rahe hone kii manyata ko kuch bal mila he
 Although Mahabharata is considered as a scripture, but many of the Mahajanapadas like Kashi, Kosala Anga, Magadha, Asmak, Avanti, Gandhara, Chedi etc
 mentioned in Buddhist literature "angusad Nikaya" are also mentioned in Mahabharata
 It is an indication that this book is not only mythological, but also preserves some historicity
 puraane kile kii purvi diwaar ke paas dubaara khudaai 1969 se 1973 ke bich bhi kii gai thi
 There is no evidence of human settlement from Mahabharata, but from the Mauryan period to the early Mughal period, this area was full of human settlement
 aise pramaan milte gaye hai jiname kaal vishesh ke sikke, manake, mitti ke bartan, paki mitti kii yaksha yakshiyon kii choti choti pratimaaen, lipi yukt mudraayen aadi pramukh hai jo kile ke sangrahalay main prardashit hai
 It is said that the Mughal Emperor Humayun had established his own city "dinpanah" on the same mound on the banks of river Yamuna under which Indraprastha is buried
 tatpashchaat shershah sur ne jab humayun par vijay praapt kii to sabhi bhawanon ko nasht kar vartmaan dilli, shershahi yaa “shergarh” kaa nirmaan prarambh karavaaya
 In the meantime, Humayun reunited and attacked and regained his lost sultanate
 samajha jaataa he ki kile kaa nirmaan kaary humayun ne hi 1545 main purna karaayaa tha
 The old fort was originally built on the banks of the river Yamuna, but from the slopes of the north and west directions, it appears that a moat connecting the river was built for safety
 is kile kii chahar deewari lagbhag 2
4 kilometre lambi he or iske teen mukhya darvaaze uttar, pashchim or dakshin main hai
 Out of these, the western gate is nowadays used to enter the fort

 While bending, his legs got stuck in a long coat and he lost his balance and fell down
 is durghatana se hui shaareerik kshati se hi 1556 ke purvardh main vah chal basaa
 Indraprastha, the capital of the Pandavas mentioned in the Mahabharata, was probably at this place
 puraane kile main vibhinn sthanon par shilapaton par yah vaakya likhe hai
 Where was Indraprastha, the capital of the Pandavas? People have been debating about this
 lekin khudaai main mili avasheshon ke aadhaar par puratatvavidon kaa ek bada varg yah maanata he ki pandavon kii rajdhani isi sthal par rahi hogi
 Although archaeologists do not have strong evidence for this, the remains of the pottery found during the excavation strengthen the talk of the Pandavas being the capital around the fort
 yahaan khudaai main aise bartanon ke avshesh mili hai, jo mahabharat se jude anya sthanon par bhi mili hai
 Apart from this, the context and ancient traditions related to Mahabharata also indicate that here must have been the capital of the Pandavas
 bharat main bahut kam nagar aise hai, jo dilli kii samaan puraane hon
 According to historians, the old fort was built in the 16th century on the high mound of the site where Indraprastha was inhabited in the pre-historic period
 bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan ne is kile kii kai staron par khudaai kii he
 Excavations have unearthed remnants of ancient brown painted pottery, which belong to the Mahabharata period
 aise hi bartan anya mahabharat kaaleen sthalon par bhi paae gaye hai
 There is also a fact about this that a village named Indraprat, the apabhramsa of Indraprastha, was located in Purana Qila until the beginning of the present century
 rajdhani nai dilli kaa nirmaan karne ke dauraan anya gaanvon ke saath use bhi hataa diya gaya tha
 a Sanskrit inscription of 1328 AD has been obtained from Sarval village located in Delhi
 yah abhilekh laal kile ke sangrahalay main upasthit he
 This inscription mentions this village to be located in Indraprastha district
 vahiin mahabharat ke anusaar kuru desh kii rajdhani ganga ke kinare hastinapur main sthit thi
 When relations between the Pandavas and their cousins, the Kauravas deteriorated, Dhritarashtra, the father of the Kauravas, gave the Pandavas the territory of Khandavaprastha on the banks of the Yamuna
 vahaan unhone samudr jaise gaddhon dwaara ghire hue ek nagar ko banaaya or uski rakshaatmak prachiren banaai
 Scholars believe that the outline of Purana Qila was also similar
 isse bhi spasht hota he ki indraprastha ek nagar kaa naam tha, jo purana kila ke sthaan par basaa tha or jis kshetra main yah sthit tha, us kshetra kaa naam khandavaprastha tha
 After his victory over the Kauravas, the Pandavas are said to have handed over the capital Indraprastha to a Yadav descendant belonging to Lord Krishna
 ek or prasang he, jiske anusaar pandavon ne kauravon se paanch gaanv maange the
 These were the villages whose names come at the end

 Places whose names are given

 Marathi literature is a very rich and strong appendage of Maharashtra's life

 "sri Chamund Raje Karviyale, Gangaraje Suttale Karvilaya" is the first known line in the Marathi language written on the lower part of the Gomateshwara statue of a place called Shravanabelagola in Mysore region
 yah sambhavat: shaq 905 main utkeern kii gai hogi
 From here about 75 inscriptions dating back to the time of Yadavas have been found till date

 Due to the creation of Marathi language mainly from Maharashtri Prakrit and Apabhramsa languages, it has also received a succession of incomparable language of Sanskrit

 Its script is Devanagari

 There are indications of this cult from his literature
 marathi bhashaa ke adwitiya sahityabhandar kaa nirmaan karanevaale gyandev ko hi marathi kaa sarvshereshth kavi mana jaataa he
 His work Dnyaneshwari, written at the age of 15, is very famous
 unke granth amritanubhav tathaa changdev passhti, vedant charchaa se otprot hai
 The superiority of Jnanadev is present in the inspiration of his devotion as well as his supernatural work
 is kaary main unhen apane samakaleen sant namdev kii amuly sahaayta praapt hui he
 These two saints, in the form of knowledge and devotion, gave a strong place to the new tradition of traditional life in Maharashtra
 inke bhaktipradhan sahitya tathaa divya jivan ke kaaran maharashtra ke sabhi virgon ke samaaj main bhagavadbhakton kaa parmaarthik lokarajya sthapit hone kaa abhas mila
 Saints like Chokha Mela, Gora Kumhar, Narhari Sonar etc
 belong to this tradition
 isi samay chakradhar dwaara sthapit mahanubhaviya granthkaaron kii ek alag shrinkhalaa kaa aarambh hua
 Nagdevacharya, the lay disciple of Chakradhar, strengthened the foundation of the cult by consolidating the Mahanubhav sect
 inhen kii prerana se mahendra bhat, keshavraj suri aadi logon ne granthrachana kii
 Mahendra Bhat's "leelacharitra", which recounts the memoir of Chakradhar Ji, is the original text of this cult
 iske atirikt inke dwaara likhit smritisthal, keshavraj suri kaa murtiprakash tathaa drushtaantapath, damodar pandit kaa vatsaharan, narendra kaa rukmini swayamvar, bhaskar bhat kaa shishupalavadh or uddhavgita aadi mahanubhav panth ke pramukh granth hai

 are well accepted in Marathi
 ekanath ke hi samay main prachur maatra main sahityanirmaan karanevaale dasopant naamak kavi hue
 The "kalavilas" of Mukteshwar, grandson of Eknath, occupy a high position in the Marathi language
 inke likhe mahabharat ke paanchon parv maano navrason se susajjit mandakini hi hai
 In the 17th century, Tukaram and Ramdas did extensive work of religious awakening at the same time
 gyanadevadi warkari sampradaay ke adhikariyon dwaara nirmit dharmamandir par tukaraam ke kaary ne maanon kalash baithaaya
 Tukaram's voice received a stupendous ooze in exposing the hypocritical statements of pothi pundits and the hypocrisy shown in the name of rituals
 phir bhi jis sadhak avasthaa se unhen janaa padaa uskaa unke dwaara kiya hua varnan kavy kaa utkrisht namoona he
 The literature of Ramdas is an appendage of pramartha as well as pragmatic caution and social mobilization
 chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ke guru hone ke kaaran unke charitra kii ujvalata bad gai
 Nevertheless, he himself has gained distinction due to the realization he has given in relation to the efforts, folklore, pulsing of the wicked, etc
 dasbodh, manaache shloke, karunashtak aadi unke granth parmarth ke vichaar se paripurna hai
 The subjects of some of his chapters are influenced by political ideas
 tukaraam ramdaas ke kalkhand main vaaman pandit, raghunatha pandit, samraj, nagesh, tathaa vitthal aadi shivakaleen aakhyankarta kaviyon kii ek lambii panrapara ho gai

 inke rachit aryaa bharat, 108 ramayana tathaa saikadon footkar kavyrachanaayen bhashaprabhutv evam suras varnanstyli ke kaaran vidvanmanya hui hai
 In the time of the Peshwas, "shahiri" poets gave a different look to Marathi poetry
 ramjoshi, prabhakar honaji bala ityadi kaviyon ne sant kaviyon ke anusaar parmarth par kavyrachana na karte hue samakaleen itihaas saamagree grahan kar veeraspurn kavy kaa nirmaan kiya
 The "powada" literature composed by these poets is an integral part of the history of Maharashtra
 inhen raajakaviyon ke laavni sahitya main stripurushon ke shringaar kaa bhavy varnan he
 Although some of them have also produced "lavani" literature on Vairagya, their specialty is expressed only in Powayas and Shringarik Lavanese
 pracheen marathi sahitya pradhanat: padyamay hone ke kaaran usamen gadhy kaa bhaag bahut chota hona swaabhaavik he
 In this, the literature is not completely neglected even though it is not completely plain from the historical point of view
 krishnaji shamrao kii likhi bhaau sahib kii bakhar, krishnaji anant sabhasad likhit shiv chhatrapati kii bakhar, sowni dwaara likhi peshwaon kii bakhar ityadi bakharen pracheen marathi gadhy ke utkrisht namoonay hai
 Similarly, in the thousands of letters published by the men of the historical period, there is also a panoramic view of many literary qualities
 angrejon ke purvakaleen sahitya kii seemaa yahan samaapt hoti he or ek nae yug kaa prarambh hota he
 The inspiration of literature of this time was usually for the life of religion, so even though the literature produced in this long period is very vivid, most of it is the same
 kaavyon ke vishay, aadhyatmik vichaar, puranic kathaayen tathaa aisi hi anya baaten thim jo thode se herpher ke saath pun: pun: ai si maaloom hoti hai
 Due to the manipulation of time and the changing of the person, the method of description changed, but in literature the same charitable flow kept flowing
 angrejon ke shashan kaal se hi maharashtra ke navayuvakon main apni nishchit seemaa se kuch dur jane ke praytn chal rahe the
 Due to the promotion of printing art, the literature reading class started to increase everywhere, so for their satisfaction, the literary too started entering new literary fields

 Similarly, the historical drama "thorle Madhavrao Peshwa" written in 1861 by Vriddh Kirtane, heralded a new era in theatrical literature

 krishna shastri chiplunkar, parashuram tathya godbhole, lokahitvaadi deshmukh, daadoba pandurang aadi bahushrut vyaktiyon ne anek vishyon par granthrachana kar marathi vaanmay ko vikaas ke kshetra main sabhi ore se nayaa mode diya
 The various characters of this time, like Gyan Prakash, Gyan Prakash, Gyanasangraha, Digdarshan, etc
, also played a role in pacifying the knowledge of the new generation of literature
 1874 main vishnu shastri chiplunkar dwaara shuru kii gai nibandhmala ke kaaran marathi sahitya main hi nahin apitu maharashtra kii vichaarparampara main bhi kranti hokar nae yug kii pratishthapana hui

 maanav jivan kii asafalataa, tuchchhata, ghrinyata tathaa paraspar ke acolpaneey sambandhon kaa asundar ji kii kavitaaon ne rasikon kii kavyadrushti main hi parivartan kar diya
 In the literature written by mystics like Gadgil, Bhave, Gokhale etc

 shri pyarelal gupt apni pustak " pracheen chhattisgarh" main bade hi rochakata se likhte he - " chhattisgadhi bhashaa ardhabhagadhi kii duhita evam avadhi kii sahodara he " 
 "both Chhattisgarhi and Awadhi were born in the ninth-tenth century from Ardhamagadhi's womb about 1080 years ago
 " Dr
 Bholanath Tibari, in his book "hindi Language" writes - "the number of Chhattisgarhi language speakers is more than that of Awadhi and in this view it rises above the level of dialect and acquires the form of language
 " Language is based on literature and literature on language

 Depending on the server application, the hardware required for the servers varies
 ebsolute CPU kii gati saadharantah kisi sarwar ke liye utani mahatvapurn nahin hoti he jitani ek desktop mashin ke liye hoti he
 Servers to serve countless users in a single network are the server's requirements, leading to different requirements such as faster network connections and higher i / o throughput
 chunki sarvaron ko saadharantah ek hi network par acces kiya jaataa he isliye ye bina kisi monitor yaa input divaais ke headleys mod main chaalu rah sakate hai
 Processes that are not necessary for the functioning of the server are not used

 For example, faster and higher-capacity hard drives, large heat-reducing computer fins or water-cooled devices, and uninterrupted power supplies continue operation of the server in the event of power outages
 Servers can be formed with the help of
 ye ghatak tadnusaar adhik mulya par ucch pradarshan or nirbharta pradaan karte hai
 Hardware redundancy is widely used in which more than one hardware is installed, such as a power supply and a hard disk
 They are arranged in such a way that if one fails, then the other one becomes available automatically
 It uses ECC memory devices to detect and fix errors; But devices without ECC memory can cause data disturbances
 sarwar aksar rack-mounted hote hai tathaa inhen suvidha or suraksha kii drushti se shaareerik pahunch se dur rakhane ke liye sarwar kakshon main rakhaa jaataa he
 Many servers take a long time to start up the hardware and load the operating system
 sarwar aksar vyapak purv-boot memory pareekshan va satyaapan karte hai or tab doordaraj ke prabandhan sevaaon ko shuru karte hai
 The hard drive controllers then start all the drives together, one by one so that they do not overload the power supply, and then they start the pre-check of the RAID system so that the redundancy is properly handled

 It is not typical that a machine takes several minutes to start, but it may not need to be restarted for months or years

 From the second century BC, India had trade relations with China, Central Asia, West Asia and the Roman Empire
 madhya asia tibet, bharat, afghanistan, china, rus or mongolia se ghira hua kshetra he
 The merchants coming and going from China had to go through this region despite many difficulties
 jo maarg unhone banaaya vah aage chalakar ‘resham-maarg’ ke naam se prasiddh hua
 It was called by this name because silk was traded from China
 aage chalakar china aane jane vaale vidwaanon, bhikshuon, aacharyon or dharmacharyon aadi ne isi maarg kaa prayog kiya
 This route served a great series in the propagation of cultures in the familiar world at that time
 bhartiya samskruti kaa prabhaav madhya asia main bhi dridhtaa se anubhav kiya gaya
 Kuchi was one of the kingdoms of Central Asia where Indian culture was at its former glory

 It was here that along with silk, precious stones, horses and other important items called jade were traded
 parantu is maarg se hokar jane vaala sabase adhik prabhaavshaalee tatva tha-buddha dharm
 Therefore, it can be said that this trade route spread the faith and belief of religion and philosophy, language and literature, art and culture
 khotaan ek bahut hi mahatvapurn padaav tha
 It was situated on the southern silk route
 bharat ke saath iske sambandhon kaa itihaas do hajaar varsh purana he
 Nestled on the green earth amidst the desert, this Khotan state was famous for silk textile industry, dance and music, literary and trade activities, and the trade of gold and jade

 jaldi hi buddha dharm ko rajdharm ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Thousands of people became monks and nuns

 'siddhant' is another form of 'siddham', 'siddham' means such script which gives accomplishment
 aaj bhi japani vidvan sanskrit ke adhyayan ke liye utsuk rahete hai
 In fact, being the language of Buddhist texts, Sanskrit is acting as an important link between India and Japan

 The names of the states there were named in Sanskrit such as Dwaravati, Srivijaya, Ayodhya and Sukhodaya etc
 thailand main nagaron ke naam bhi bhartiyata ke dyotak hai jaise-kanchanpuri ke tarj par kanchanburi, raajpuri ke samaan rajaburi or lavpuri ke samaan lobpuri

 The history of deep cultural relations between India and Cambodia goes back to the first and second centuries AD
 pratham shatabdi se kamboj main bhartiya mul ke shaasha kaundinya rajvansh ne shashan kiya
 We can infer their history from numerous Sanskrit inscriptions and literature

 The people of Cambodia built huge monuments and decorated them with statues of Shiva, Vishnu, Buddha and many deities from Indian epics and Puranas
 raajaaon ke dwaara in granthon ke aitihaasik ghatnaon ko pradarshit karne ke liye kathankon se anek ansh chune gaye
