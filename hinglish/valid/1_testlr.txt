 isiilie saamaajik manovigyaan ko paribhaashit karnaa saamaanya kaary nahi he
 Robert A
 Baron and John Byrne have rightly written, 'this difficulty in social psychology increases due to two reasons: the broadness of the subject area and the rapid changes in it
 ’ saamaajik manovigyaan ko paribhaashit karte hue unhone likhaa he ki, ‘‘saamaajik manovigyaan vah vigyaan he jo saamaajik paristhitiyon main vyakti ke vyavhaar or vichaar ke swaroop va kaarnon kaa adhyayan karata he
 "something similar is believed by Kimball Young too
" unhonen saamaajik manovigyaan ko paribhaashit karte hue likhaa he ki, ‘‘saamaajik manovigyaan vyaktiyon kii parsparik antakriyaaon kaa adhyayan karata he, or is sandarbh main ki in antalakriyaaon kaa vyakti vishesh ke vichaaron, bhaawanaaon sanvego or aadaton par kya prabhaav padataa he
 '' sheriff or sheriff ke anusaar, ‘‘saamaajik manovigyaan saamaajik uttejnaa-paristhiti ke sandarbh main vyakti ke anubhav tathaa vyavhaar kaa vaigyanik adhyayan he

 '' uparokt paribhaashaon ko dekhte hue ham spashtatah kah sakate hai ki saamaajik manovaigyanik yah jaanane kaa prayaas karte hai ki vyakti ek duusare ke bare main kaise sochate hai tathaa kaise ek duusare ko prabhavit karte hai
 The nature of social psychology is scientific
 jab ham kisi bhi vishay ko vaigyanik kehete hai, to uski kuch visheshtaayen hoti hai, or un visheshtaon ke saath hi saath us vishay ke adhyayan ke antargat vibhinn vidhiyaan hoti hai, jinka prayog sambandhit vishyon ke adhyayan main kiya jaataa he raubart e

 See) In many countries, 3G networks do not use the same radio frequency as 2G networks, so mobile operators must create an entirely new network and license completely new frequencies; The United States is an exception where carriers operate the 3G service in the same frequencies as other services

 The other delay was due to expenditure incurred for upgrading equipment for new systems
 By June 2007 up to 200 million 3G subscribers were added
 puri duniya main 3 billian mobile phone graahakon main yah keval 6

 In countries where 3G first started - Japan and South Korea - 3G penetration is over 70 percent
 europe main italy agrani desh he, jiske ek tihaai graahak 3G kii ore rukh kar gaye
 Other countries turning to 3G include Britain, Austria, Australia and Singapore with a migration level of 20 percent

 China announced in May 2008 that the telecom sector was reorganized and three 3G networks would be allocated so that the largest mobile operator, China Mobile, could maintain its GSM subscriber base
 china unicom apane GSM graahak aadhaar ko banaaye rakhega lekin apane CDMA2000 graahak aadhaar ko tyaag degaa or vishwastareey WCDMA maanakon par 3G kii shuruyaat karegaa
 China Unicom's CDMA2000 customers will move to China Telecom, which will then introduce 3G on the CDMA 1x EV-DO standard
 matlab yah ki china sabhi teen mukhya cellular praudyogiki ke vyavsaayik upyog main 3 ji maanakon hoga
 Finally in January 2009, China's Ministry of Industry and Information was awarded the license for all three standards
 ye maanak hai china mobile ke liye TD-SCDMA, china unicom ke liye WCDMA or china telekom ke liye CDMA2000
 In November 2008, Turkey auctioned four IMT 2000 / UMTS standard 3G licenses with 45, 40, 35 and 25 mhz peak frequencies

 phir bhi kai vikasshil deshon ko 3G license nahin diya gaya he or graahak 3G sevaaon kaa intazaar kar rahen hai

 ITU ne un data daron kii spasht paribhaasha uplabdh nahin karaayi he, jisaki apeksha 3G upkaran yaa pradaata se kii jaati he
 Thus 3G service with 4 tertebb4454t sold to the users is not able to specify a standard and it can be said that the rates specified by it are not suitable

 3G networks use KASUMI block crypto, instead of older A5 / 1 stream ciphers
 haalanki, KASUMI sifer main kai gambhir kamajoriyaan paayi gayi hai
 In addition to 3G network infrastructure protection, end-to-end security is introduced when application frameworks such as IMS are available, although this is not strictly a property of 3G
 ==2G se vikaas ==2G network ko mukhya rup se dhwani sevaaon or dhime data sancharan ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 The first major step for the development of 3G is the introduction of General Packet Radio Service
 Hence cellular services with GPRS became '2
5G'
 GPRS 56 kbit / s se 114 kbit / s tak kii data daren uplabdh kara saktaa he
 It can be used for services such as wireless application protocol access, multimedia messaging service, and Internet communication services such as email and worldwide web access
 GPRS data sthaanantaran ko aamtaur par stanantrit treffic ke prati megabit ke anusaar charge kiya jaataa he, jabaki paaramparik circuit swimming ke madhyam se data sanchaar kaa bill sangyojan samay ke prati minute ke hisaab se aata he, yah is baat se swatantra hota he ki upyogkarta vastav main kshamta kaa upyog kar rahaa he yaa adarsh avasthaa main he

75G === GPRS networks evolved into EDGE networks with the introduction of 8PSK encoding
 Increased data rates for GSM development, increased GPRS, or IMT single carrier is a backward compatible digital mobile phone technology that improves data transmission rates as an extension on top of standard GSM
 EDGE ko ek 3G radio takanic mana ja saktaa he or yah ITU kii 3G paribhaasha kaa ek hissaa he, lekin ise adhiktar 2
75G ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 EDGE was deployed on the GSM network in early 2003 — initially launched by Cingular in the US
 EDGE GSM varg ke bhaag ke rup main 3GPP ke dwaara manakikrut he or yah ek unnayan he jo GSM / GPRS network kii kshamta main sambhavit trivalani vruddhi uplabdh karaata he
 The specification achieves higher data rates for more sophisticated methods of coding, within existing GSM timeslots

 Empiricism and scientific method were sought to value any social claim or conclusion to provide an undisputed basis and to separate sociology from relatively less empirical fields such as philosophy

 Emil Durkheim was a great supporter of theoretically based empirical research, seeking connections between "social facts" to reflect structural rules
 unki sthiti "anomi" ko khaarij karne or saamaajik sudhaar ke liye saamaajik nishkarshon main unki ruchi se anupranit hoti thi
 Today, Durkheim's description of scholarly positivism may be vulnerable to exaggeration and over-simplification: Comet was the only prominent social thinker who claimed that the social department could also fall under the same scientific analysis as elite science, while Durkheim Has acknowledged the fundamental knowledge boundaries in more detail
