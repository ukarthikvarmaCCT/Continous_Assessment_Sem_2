 The story of Dhola is based on the dhora-maru / dhola-maru of Rajasthan in which Dhola, when young, gets married in his childhood after many difficulties

 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga The sermon that Shri Krishna preached to Arjuna in the battlefield of Kuru region is known as Srimad Bhagavadgita
 yah mahabharat ke bhishmaparv kaa ang he
 The Gita has 18 chapters and 720 verses
 jaisaa gita ke shankar bhashya main kaha he- tan dharman bhagawata yathopadisht vedavyas: sarvagyobhagavan gitakhyai: saptabhi: shlokashatairu panibandh
 It is known that in the early 20th century, in front of Geeta Press Gorakhpur, there was the same text of Geeta which is available to us today
 20veen sadi ke lagbhag bhishmaparv kaa java kii bhashaa main ek anuwaad hua tha
 Many basics are also safe in it
 shripad krishna belwelkar ke anusaar java ke is pracheen sanskaran main gita ke keval saadhe ikyasi shloke mul sanskrit ke hai
 They also support the current text
 gita kii gananaa prasthaantrayee main kii jaati he, jisamen upanishad or brahmasutra bhi sanmilit hai
 Therefore, according to Indian tradition, the place of Gita is the same as that of Upanishads and Brahmasutras
 gita ke mahatmaya main upanishdon ko gau or gita ko uskaa dugdh kaha gaya he
 This means that the Gita accepts the spirituality of the Upanishads in the Sarvansh
 upanishdon kii anek vidyaayein gita main hai
 For example, Ashwattha lore in relation to the nature of the world, Avyayamusha lore in the context of eternal Ajna Brahma, Aksha Purushu vidha in the matter of Para Prakriti or Jiva, and Ksharapurushu Vidya concerning Apara Prakriti or material world
 is prakaar vedon ke brahmavaad or upanishdon ke aadhyatm, in donon kii vishisht saamagree gita main sannivisht he
 In the words of Pushpika it is called theology
 gita main 'brahmavidya' kaa aashay nivrittiparak gyanmarg se he
 It is called Sankhyamat with which the Nivitvarigi Vibhagya is associated
 lekin gita upanishdon ke mode se aage badhkar us yug kii dein he, jab ek nayaa darshan janm le rahaa tha jo grihasthon ke pravriti dharm ko nivritti maarg ke samakaksh or utana hi faldaayak maanata tha
 The same signifies the word 'yogashastra' in the Pushpika of the Gita
 yahan ‘yogashastre’ kaa abhipraay ni:andeh karmyog se hi he
 Two definitions of yoga are found in the Gita
 ek nivritti maarg kii drushti se jisamen ‘samatvam yoga uchyate’ kaha gaya he arthath gunon ke vaishamy main samyabhav rakhana hi yoga he
 This is the position of Sankhya
 yoga kii duusari paribhaasha he ‘yoga: karmsu kaushalam’ arthath karmon main lage rahane par bhi aise upaay se karm karnaa ki vah bandhan kaa kaaran na ho or karm karanevaala usee asang yaa nirlep sthiti main apane ko rakh sake jo gyanamargiyon ko milti he
 The name of this device is Buddhayog and this is the essence of the Yoga of the Gita
 gita ke duusare adhyay main jo ‘tasya pragnapratishthita’ kii dhun pai jaati he, uskaa abhipraay nirlep karm kii kshamtavali buddhi se hi he
 This was not a situation of attaining renunciation by the renunciation of karma, but a plan to elevate the pre-existing mind to a state of disinterest while performing karma
 yahi gita kaa karmyog he
 Just as in many places in the Mahabharata, so is the interpretation and appreciation of the Sankhya path of Sankhya and the path of Karma
 ek kii ninda or duusare kii prashansa gita kaa abhimath nahin, donon maarg do prakaar kii ru chi rakhanevaale manushyon ke liye hitkar ho sakate hai or hai
 Probably no other book of the world renders the scripture of Karma with this beauty, this subtlety and objectivity
 is drushti se gita adbhut maanviya shaastra he
 Its vision is not one-sided, but all-round
 gita main darshan kaa pratipaadan karte hue bhi jo sahitya kaa anand he vah isaki atirikt visheshta he
 The description of the philosophy through cultured poetry is the personal grief of the Gita, which does not remain without enchanting any heart
 isiilie iskaa naam bhagavadgita padaa, bhagavan kaa gaaya hua gyaan
 The background of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita is the war of Mahabharata
 jis prakaar ek saamaanya manushya apane jivan kii samasyaon main ulajhakar kinkartavyavimudh ho jaataa he or uske pashchaat jivan ke samarangan se palaayan karne kaa man bana letaa he usee prakaar arjuna jo mahabharat kaa mahanayake he apane saamne aane vaali samasyaon se bhaybheet hokar jivan or kshatriya dharm se niraash ho gaya he, arjuna kii tarah hi ham sabhi kabhi-kabhi anishchay kii sthiti main yaa to hataash ho jate hai or yaa phir apni samasyaon se udign hokar kartavya vimukh ho jate hai
 The sages of India, after deep thought, imbibed the knowledge they gave to the Vedas
 inhen vedon kaa antim bhaag upanishad kehalaata he
 The characteristic of human life is the intellectual power acquired by human beings, and the knowledge contained in the Upanishads is not only the highest state of human intelligence but also gives a glimpse of what man can experience beyond the limits of intellect
 gita ke 18 adhyyon main varnit vishyon kii bhi kramprapt sangati he
 The name of the first chapter is Arjunvishad Yoga
 vah gita ke upadesh kaa vilakshan naatakeey rangamanch prastut karata he jisamen shrota or vaktaa donon hi kutuhal shanti ke liye nahin varan jivan kii pragadh samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye pravrutt hote hai
 Shaurya and patience, courage and strength made Arjuna's personality with the impressive amount of these four qualities and above all these four qualities were one and forgiveness, the other is wisdom
 balpradhan kshatradharm se praapt honevaali sthiti main pahunchakar sahasaa arjuna ke chitt par ek duusare hi prakaar ke manobhaav kaa akraman hua, carpanya kaa
 a strange kind of compassion filled his mind and his faint nature vanished
 jis kartavya ke liye vah katibaddh hua tha usase vah vimukh ho gaya
 On looking from above, his arguments in favor of this situation seem to be religious, but he himself has called it Karpanya Dosh and it is believed that due to this cuteness of mind, his natal nature was hurt or destroyed
 vah nirnay nahin kar paa rahaa tha ki yuddh kare athwa vairaygy le le
 What to do, what not to do, was not understood
 is manobhaav kii charam sthiti main pahunchakar usne dhanushbaan ek ore daal diya
 Krishna saw Arjuna's condition that Arjuna's body was fine but before the start of the war, the morale of that wonderful Kshatriya was broken
 bina man ke yah sharir khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Therefore, a guru duty came in front of Krishna
 at: tark se, buddhi se, gyaan se, karm kii charchaa se, vishwa ke swabhaav se, usamen jivan kii sthiti se, donon ke niamak avyay purush ke parichay se or us sarvopari param sattavan brahm ke saakshaat darshan se arjuna ke man kaa uddhaar karnaa, yahi unka lakshya hua
 The subject of this discussion is Gita
 pehle adhyay main saamaanya reeti se bhoomika rup main arjuna ne bhagwaan se apni sthiti kah di
 The second chapter is named Sankhyayoga
 isamen jivan kii do pracheen sanmanit paramparaon kaa tarkon dwaara varnan aayaa he
 Seeing Arjuna weeping in that sorrowful condition, Krishna has brought to his attention that this type of claviness and petty infirmity of heart is not suitable for a hero like Arjun
 krishna ne arjuna kii ab tak di hui sab yuktiyon ko pragnawad kaa jhootha rup kaha
 His trick is that Pragyadarshana essentially accepts all the events and situations of the world from time, karma and nature
 jeena or maranaa, janm lenaa or badhanaa, vishyon kaa aana or janaa
 Experiences of happiness and sorrow, these occur only in the world, this was also called the ancient Acharya synonymism
 kaal kii chakragati in sab sthitiyon ko laati he or le jaati he
 After knowing this nature of life, there is no mourning again
 yahi bhagwaan kaa vyangy he ki pragna ke drushtikon ko maanate hue bhi arjuna is prakaar ke moh main kyon pad gaya he
 An essential part of the above view was the continuity of life and the impermanence of the body
 nity jeev ke liye shok karnaa utana hi vyarth he jitna anitya sharir ko bachaane kii chintaa
 Both of these are unavoidable
 janm or mrityu baari baari se hote hi hai, aisa samajhakar shok karnaa uchit nahin he
 Then another view is of apostasy
 janm se hi prakruti ne sabake liye ek dharm niyat kar diya he
 In it comes the path of life, the periphery of desires, the power of karma
 isse nikal kar nahin bhaaga ja saktaa
 Even if someone runs away, nature again pulls him
 is prakaar kaal kaa parivartan yaa pariman, jeev kii nityata or apana swadharm yaa swabhaav jin yuktiyon se bhagavan, ne arjuna ko samajhaayaa he use unhone sankhya kii buddhi kaha he
 Further, even after Arjuna did not question, he also described the wisdom of the yogamarga
 yah buddhi karm yaa pravriti maarg ke aagrah kii buddhi he isamen karm karte hue karm ke fal kii aasakti se apane ko bachaana aavashyak he
 The biggest fear for the Karmayogi is that he gets trapped in the party of desire for fruit; He should avoid it
 arjuna ko andeh hua ki kya is prakaar kii buddhi praapt karnaa sambhav he
 What would be the situation of a person if he did deeds and no fruit, it was a practical doubt
 usne poocha ki is prakaar kaa drudh pragnawala vyakti jivan kaa vyavhaar kaise karata he? aana, janaa, khaanaa, pinaa, karm karnaa, unamem lipt hokar bhi nirlep kaise rahaa ja saktaa he? krishna ne kitne hi prakaar ke bahya indriyon kii apeksha man ke sanyam kii vyakhya kii he
 Through work, anger, fear, raga, malice, the mild mind is disturbed and the senses are not in control
 indriyajay hi sabase badi aatmajay he
 Even if someone gives up subjects from outside, the inner mind does not agree
 vishyon kaa swaad jab man se jaataa he, tabhi man prafullit, shant or sukhi hota he
 Rivers come in the sea, but he does not give up his dignity
 aise hi sansar main rahete hue, uske vyavhaaron ko sweekaarte hue, anek kaamanaayon kaa pravesh man main hota rahata he
 But those who do not lose their dignity only get peace
 ise pracheen aadhyatm paribhaasha main gita main brahmisthiti kaha he
 Thus, listening to the answer of Sankhya's explanation, in the third chapter called Karmayoga, Arjuna asked a clear question to get deeper into the subject that Sankhya and Yoga do you think well in both these passages and why not say that i am in both of them Whom should i adopt? To this, Krishna replied with the same clearness that there are two loyalties or lifespans in the world - jnana yoga for the Samkhists and karmayoga for the Karmargamis
 yahan koi vyakti karm chhod hi nahin saktaa
 Nature compels a person to perform actions with the effect of all three qualities
 karm se bachnewaalon ke prati ek badi shankaa he, vah yah ki ve upar se to karm chhod baithte hai par man hi man usamen duube rahete hai
 This situation is unbearable and Krishna has called it falsehood in the Gita
 man main karmedriyon ko rokkar karm karnaa hi saral maanviya maarg he
 Krishna even said as a challenge that without karma one cannot get food to eat
 phir krishna ne karm ke vidhaan ko chakra ke rup main upasthit kiya
 Not only are the creations of different persons threaded together on the social plane, but the relationship between man on earth and God of heaven is also dependent on the action cycle
 pratyaksh he ki yahan manushya karm karte hai, krishi karte hai or daivi shaktiyaan vrishti kaa jal bhejti hai
 Both grain and purgenes arise from karma
 ek main maanviya karm, duusare main daivi karm
 Then in favor of Karma, the idea of lok Sangraha has been given, that is, without Karma, the structure of society cannot stand
 jo lok ke netaa hai, janak jaise gyani hai, ve bhi karm main pravriti rakhte hai
 Krishna himself gave his own illustration and said that i am the form of Narayana, there is no work left for me
 phir bhi tandrarahit hokar karm karata hoon or anya log mere maarg par chalate hai
 The difference is that those who are foolish do the work by indulging but the knowledgeable does the work with disrespect
 gita main yaheen ek sabhipraay shabd buddhibhed he
 That is, it is not proper to uproot the people of ordinary understanding who are engaged in karma, because they cannot become knowledgeable, and if their karma is missed, then they will go astray on both sides
 chauthe adhyay main, jiskaa naam gyaan-karm-sanyas-yoga he, yah bataaya gaya he ki gyaan praapt karke karm karte hue bhi karmsanyas kaa fal kis upaay se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In this true Karmayoga is considered to occur in the tradition of the Chakravarti kings
 mandhata, sudarshan aadi anek chakravarti raajaaon ke drushtaant die gaye hai
 This is the famous assurance of the Gita that when there is defamation of religion, then there is an incarnation of God among humans, that is, the power of God is especially tangible
 yaheen par ek vaakya vishesh dhyaan dene yogya he- kshipran hi manushe loke siddhirbhavatee karmaja 
 'karma se siddhi' - There is no more effective sutra in Gitadarshan
 kintu gitatv is sutara main itnaa sudhaar or karata he ki vah karm asang bhav se arthath falasakti se bachakar karnaa chahie
 In the fifth chapter, again she has gone somewhere in the form of tips and perseverance
 isamen karm ke saath jo man kaa sambandh he, uske sanskaar par yaa use vishuddh karne par vishesh dhyaan dilaayaa gaya he
 It has also been said that there is no difference between Sankhya and Yoga by reaching a high level
 kisi ek maarg par thik prakaar se chale to samaan fal praapt hota he
 By surrendering all the deeds of life, a person reaches the pole point of absolute peace and does not indulge in karmic water like a lotus blooming in water
 chatha adhyay aatmasanyam yoga he jiskaa vishay naam se hi prakat he
 The number of subjects is the restraint of the most senses - this is the squeeze of karma and knowledge
 sukh main or dukh main man kii samaan sthiti, ise hi yoga kehete hai
 The noun of the seventh chapter is Jnana Vigyan Yog
 ye pracheen bhartiya darshan kii do paribhaashaayen hai
 Among them, the word science was very important from the Vedic point of view
 sristi ke nanaatv kaa gyaan vigyaan he or nanaatv se ekatv kii ore pragati gyaan he
 Both these views are suitable for humans
 is prasang main vigyaan kii drushti se aparaa or para prakruti ke in do roopon kii jo sunishchit vyakhya yahan gita ne di he, vah avashya dhyaan dene yogya he
 Apara Prakriti has eight elements, Panchabhuta, Mind, Wisdom and Ego
 jis and se maanav kaa janm hota he
 These eight live in it
 kintu yah praakrit sarg he arthath yah jad he
 In this, the consciousness that comes from contact with the efforts of God is called Para Prakriti; He is a living being
 aath tatwon ke saath milakar jivan navaan tatv ho jaataa he
 In this chapter, many forms of God are mentioned, whose further expansion comes in the tenth chapter called Vibhutiog
 yaheen vishesh bhagwati drushti kaa bhi ullekh he jiskaa sutara-vasudev: sarvamiti, sab vasu yaa shariron main ek hi devtatv he, usee kii sangya vishnu he
 But in the people according to their own idi, the same deity is worshiped in many names and forms
 ve sab thik hai
 But it is good that a wise person recognizes the universe which is the highest peak of spiritual science
 aathven adhyay kii sangya akshar brahmyog he
 Akshar Vidya expanded in Upanishads
 gita main us aksharavidya kaa saar kah diya gaya he-akshar brahm paraman, arthath parabrahm kii sangya akshar he
 Spirituality is the name of the combined composition of man, that is, organism and body
 jeevasanyukt bhautik deh kii sangya kshar he or keval shaktitatv kii sangya aadhidaivak he
 The way these three powers work together in the body, the God, and the ghost are called Adhigyas
 gitakar ne do shlokon main in chah paribhaashaon kaa swaroop band diya he
 In the words of Gita, ॐ monosyllable is Brahman
 nawein adhyay ko raajaguhyayog kaha gaya he, arthath yah aadhyatm vidya vidyaraji he or yah guhya gyaan sabamein shreshth he
 The word Raja also had a meaning in mind
 atev man kii divya shaktimayon ko kis prakaar brahmamay banaaya jaay, isaki yukti hi rajvidya he
 In this area, the representation of Brahmanism is predominant, from which the creation of the expressed world is repeated
 veda kaa samast karmkand yajna, amrit, or mrityu, sant or asant, or jitne bhi devi devtaa he, sabakaa paryavsaan brahm main he
 The variety of Devpuja which is popular in the world is also right in its place, this vision of coordination was acceptable to the Bhagwat Acharyas, in fact it was their great power
 isi drushtikon kaa vichaar yaa vyakhya dasven adhyay main pai jaati he
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 iskaa saar yah he ki lok main jitne devtaa hai, sab ek hi bhagwaan, kii vibhutiyaan hai, manushya ke samast gun or avagun bhagwaan kii shakti ke hi rup hai
 Wisdom may be able to explain these liberated gods, but they are there in the world
 koi pipal ko pooj rahaa he
 Some mountain, river or sea, some fish and turtles
 yon kitne devtaa hai, iskaa koi ant nahin
 This abundance of deities is found everywhere in the history of the world
 bhagwaton ne inaki satta ko sweekaarte hue sabko vishnu kaa rup maanakar samanvay kii ek nai drushti pradaan kii
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 jo satv jeev balayukt athwa chamatkarayukt he, vah sab bhagwaan kaa rup he
 Considering this, the mind gets into an uncontrolled state
 11wein adhyay kaa naam vishvaroopadarshan yoga he
 In this, Arjuna saw the world form of God
 viraat rup kaa arth he maanviya dharaatal or paridhi ke upar jo anant vishwa kaa pranavant rachanavidhan he, uskaa saakshaat darshan
 The quadrilateral form of Vishnu is benign on the human plane
 jab arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa viraat rup dekha to uske mastak kaa visphoton hone laga
 'directo na jaane na labhe f shame' These same sentences of panic came out of his mouth and he prayed that the natural condition which God has placed for man is sufficient
 13wein adhyay main ek sidhaa vishay kshetra or kshetrajna kaa vichaar he
 This is the body area, the person who knows it is a field expert
 14wein adhyay kaa naam gunatray vibhaag yoga he
 This subject is a squeeze of all the Vedic, philosophical and mythological metaphysics — there are many interpretations of the three gunas — trios called sattva, raja, tam
 gunon kii samyavastha kaa naam pradhan yaa prakruti he
 a pathless creation is born from the contrast of qualities
 akelaa satv shant swabhaav se nirmal prakaash kii tarah sthir rahata he or akelaa tam bhi jadvat nishcesht rahata he
 But Rajoguna, who is in the middle of the two, drags them to the ground of Chesta
 gati tatv kaa naam hi rajas he
 The name of the 15th chapter is Purushottamayoga
 isamen vishwa kaa ashwatth ke rup main varnan kiya gaya he
 This ashwattha-like world is a great expansion
 desh or kaal main iskaa koi ant nahin he
 But the root or center of it, which is called the upward, is Brahm
 On the one hand, the ultimate glory, which gives rise to the cosmopolitan Ashwattha, is manifested in the form of the Sun and the Moon, on the other hand, it is in a Chaitanya center or Zoological
 Is in the body
 jaisaa gita main spasht kaha he-ahan vaishwanaro bhutva praninaan dehamashrith: 
 There is no more mystery than globalism or pranamayi consciousness
 nar yaa purush teen hai-kshar, akshar or avyay
 The name of the Panchabhutas is Kshar, the name of Prana is Akshar and the noun of Manastattva or Consciousness is indestructible
 inhen teen naron kii ekatra sthiti se maanvi chetana kaa janm hota he use hi rishiyon ne vaishwanar agni kaha he
 In the 16th chapter, the department of Dewasur property is described
 aarambh se hi rigdev main sristi kii kalpana daivi or asuri shaktiyon ke rup main kii gai he
 It is a fantasy of two forms of creation, one good and the other bad
 ek prakaash main, doosraa andhkaar main
 One nectar, the other mortal
 ek satya, doosraa anrut
 The noun of the 17th chapter is Shraddhatraya Vigyan Yoga
 iskaa sambandh sat, raj or tam, in teen gunon se hi he, arthath jisamen jis gun kaa pradurbhaav hota he, uski shraddha yaa jivan kii nishtha waisi hi ban jaati he
 Yagya, penance, charity, deeds are all conducted with three types of devotion
 yahan tak ki aahaar bhi teen prakaar kaa he
 The Gita has explained their differences and characteristics here
 18wein adhyay kii sangya mokshasanyas yoga he
 It contains a summary and epilogue of all the teachings of the Gita
 yahan pun: balpurvak maanav jivan ke liye teen gunon kaa mahatv kaha gaya he
 There is no one among the human beings of the earth and among the gods of heaven who is saved from these three qualities of nature
 manushya ko bahut dekh bhalkar chalanaa aavashyak he jisase vah apni buddhi or vritti ko buraai se bachaa sake or kya kaary he, kya acarya he, isko pahchaan sake
 The intellect which properly recognizes religion and unrighteousness, bondage and salvation, instinct and retirement, is the true wisdom and is the true achievement of man
 is prakaar bhagwaan ne jivan ke liye vyaavhaarik maarg kaa upadesh dekar ant main yah kaha he ki manushya ko chahie ki sansar ke sab vyavhaaron kaa sachai se paalan karte hue, jo akhand chaitanya tatv he, jise ishwar kehete hai, jo prayek praani ke hriddesh yaa centre main virajman he, usamen vishwaas rakhe, uskaa anubhav kare
 He is the entity's power, he is consciousness and he is the source of supreme bliss
 sanskrit sahitya kii parampara main un granthon ko bhashya, kehete hai jo duusare granthon ke arth kii vrihad vyakhya yaa tikaa prastut karte hai
 The Bhagavad Gita is also one of the three texts that had to clarify their perspective in order to establish any new philosophy or any new form of philosophy in the Indian philosophical tradition
 gita par anek achaaryon evam vidwaanon ne tikaayen kii hai
 Their short list according to sects is as follows: inke atirikt maharashtra sant gyandev yaa gyaneshwarkrut bhavarthadipika naam kii tikaa prasiddh he jo gita ke gyaan ko bhavatmak kavyastylee main prakat karti he
 In the present era, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilakkrit Geetarasya Tika, which was first introduced in 1915 with very detailed role and deliberation
 main puna se prakashit hui thi, gita sahitya main mahatvapurn sthaan rakhti he
 He has made such a diversion in bringing the original meaning of Gita to scholars, which was not possible till today after Shankaracharya
 vastut: shankaracharya kaa bhashya gita kaa mukhya arth gyanaprak karata he jabaki tilak ne gita ko karm kaa pratipadak shastr siddh kiya he
 Among all the languages available on the Bhagavad Gita, the element of Shri Jayadayal Goindka is the most popular and popular
 iskaa prakaashan gitapress ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Aaj Tak has sold 100 million copies
 shrimadbhagavadgita badalte saamaajik paridrishyon main apni mahatta ko banaae hue hai or isi kaaran takneekee vikaas ne isaki uplabdhta ko badhaayaa he, tathaa adhik bodhgamy banane kaa prayaas kiya he
 In the serial Mahabharata, aired on Doordarshan, Bhagavad Gita was a special attraction, while in the serial Sri Krishna, the Bhagwad Gita was highly researched and shown as a series of episodes
 isaki ek vishesh baat yah rahi ki gita se sambandhit saamaanya manushya ke sandehon ko arjuna ke prashnon ke madhyam se uttarit karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Apart from this, the serial gita-rahasya by Nitish Bhardwaj was completely focused on different dimensions of Gita itself
 internet par bhi aaj anekanek websiten is vishay par bahumadhyamon ke dwaara vishad jaankaree detii hai
 Shrimad Bhagwadgita is currently attracting attention of people not only in India but also abroad with her philosophical approach towards life more than religion
 nishkaam karm kaa gita kaa sandesh prabandhan guruon ko bhi lubhaa rahaa he
 It is included in the most famous books of all religions of the world
 gita press gorakhpur jaisi dharmik sahitya kii pustakon ko kaaphi kam mulya par uplabdh karaane vaale prakaashan ne bhi kai aakaar main arth or bhashya ke saath shrimadbhagavadgita ke prakaashan dwaara ise aam janata tak pahunchane main kaaphi yogadan diya he
 The teachings of the Gita are very ancient yoga
 shri bhagavan kehete hai ise maine sabase pehle surya se kaha tha
 The Sun is the symbol of knowledge, so the words of Shri God mean that even before the creation of the earth, i have given this knowledge to the devotees who have done many forms of research
 yah ishwariya vaani he jisamen sampoorn jivan kaa saar he evam aadhaar he
 Who am I? What is this body? Is my beginning and end with this body? Will i exist after my body renunciation? Where and in what form will this existence exist? What is the reason for me coming into the world? What will happen after leaving my body, where will i go? These things keep revolving in the heart of any curious person
 ham sadaa in baton ke bare main sochate hai or apane ko, apane swaroop ko nahin jaan pate
 In the Gita Shastra, the answers to all these questions have been readily given by Shri Bhagwan through religious dialogue
 is deh ko jisamen 36 tatv jeevatma kii upasthiti ke kaaran judakar kaary karte hai, kshetra kaha he or jeevatma is kshetra main nivas karata he, vahi is deh kaa swami he parantu ek teesraa purush bhi he, jab vah prakat hota he; adhidaiv arthath 36 tatwon vaale is deh ko or jeevatma kaa naash kar daalata he
 This perfect man is the ultimate state and ultimate truth
 yahi nahin, deh main sthit or deh tyagkar jate hue jeevatma kii gati kaa yatharth vaigyanik env tarksangat varnan gita shaastra main hua he
 The soul is eternal and the soul has attained the spirit of life
 sharir ke mar jane par jeevatma apane karmanusaar vibhinn yoniyon main vicharan karata he
 The Gita begins with the word Dharma and at the end of the eighteenth chapter of the Gita it is called Dharma Samvad
 dharm kaa arth he dhaaran karne vaala athwa jise dhaaran kiya gaya he
 The one who holds is called the soul and the one who holds it is nature
 aatma is sansar kaa beej arthath pita he or prakruti garbhadhaaran karne vaali yoni arthath mata he
 The word Dharma is used in the Gita from place to place for self-nature and living nature
 isi paripeksh main dharm evam adharm ko samajhnaa aavashyak he
 The nature of the soul is religion or it is said that religion is spirit
 aatma kaa swabhaav he purna shuddh gyaan, gyaan hi anand or shaanti kaa akshay dham he
 On the contrary, ignorance signifies unrest, tribulation and unrighteousness
 aatma akshay gyaan kaa strot he
 Kriya Shakti arises from different amounts of knowledge power, birth of nature
 prakruti ke gun satva, raj, tam kaa janm hota he
 Excess of sattva-raja gives rise to religion, demonic circles prevail in excess of tam-raja and the establishment of dharma means to establish the nature of virtues, for the growth of satoguna, soul attaining indestructible Brahmi status, its resolve She incarnates herself and performs incarnation
 sampoorn gita shaastra kaa nichod he buddhi ko hameshaa sookshm karte hue mahabuddhi aatma main lagaaye rakkho tathaa sansar ke karm apane swabhaav ke anusaar saral rup se karte raho

 Among them are jean-paul Sartre, Albert Kamu and Ingmar Bergman

 Existentialists give more importance to the existence of a person than to a thought or suffix
 inke anusaar saare vichaar yaa siddhant vyakti kii chintna ke hi parinaam hai
 The first person or person contemplating came into existence, so the person's existence is predominant, while the idea or principle is secondary
 unke vichaar se har vyakti ko apana siddhant swayan khojna yaa bananaa chahie, dusron ke dwaara pratipaadit yaa nirmit siddhanton ko sweekaar karnaa uske liye aavashyak nahin
 Due to this approach, all traditional, social, moral, classical and scientific theories prove to be invalid or impractical for them

 According to them, a person realizes his condition in a state of grief or tragedy, so he should be present to welcome that situation

 By understanding the basic subject, he wanted to define existentialism and he was successful in it to some extent
 Logos is a Greek word whose pure 'forms are' meaning I
 Logotherapy is based on the existence of a human being and the search for the meaning of man
 On the basis of logotherapy, the pursuit of meaning in life is the first motivating force of a human being
 That is why Frankl has given the importance of life to high importance
 Not Anand
 manushya ke arth ke khoj kii dhara main hataasha yaa niraashaa kaa bhi bahut bada bhaag hota handi logotherapy ne ise astitv kuntha kaa naam diya handi ‘astitv’ shabd ko teen tareeke se upyog main daalaa ja saktaa handi astitv jo apane aap main arth hai yani manushya ke jivan kaa aadharani astitv kaa arth, vyaktigat astitv main thos arth ke khoj kaa prayasi is hataasha kaa parinaam neurosis bhi ho saktaa handi victor i frankal apane marijon ke takalif dwaara ek bahut bade prashn ko uthaate hai jo aaj ke jivan main sabaki durbalata kaa kaaran ban chuki hai, vah hai zindagi main arthhinata kaa pravasdai aisi takalif adhiktar un logo main dekhi gayi jo mrityu shivi se batch niklequi in logo main zindagi ko jeene ki utsukata hi nahin rahiqui unke zehan main khokhlaapan hi rahaa kyunki ve aatanrik akelepan se guzarate handi is khoklepan yaah akelepan ko jisase har insaan jhujhata hai use victor i frankal ne astitv vaakum kaa naam diyani Existence Vacuum is a phenomenon that has become very famous in the twentieth century
 The beginning of the existential condition comes from sadness
 On this occasion, Frankel makes it clear about 'sunday Neurosis'
 It is a kind of depression in which a person has satisfaction in his life
 He feels the deficiency and realizes this when he feels the loneliness of his life after a week of parting
 Accordingly, the causes of drunkenness and juvenile delinquency cannot be understood until it recognizes the existence of a suppressed existence
 The same applies in the case of old people and pensioners
 These survival laws hold different disguises and life
 Are presented to human beings in different aspects of life
 Some of these may be the desire for power or the desire for money which in search of meaning can be done by man Week tend to blur i are the result of existential frustrations that sexual libido logotherapy kii koshish hameshaa yahi rahati hai ki marijon ko puri tarah se apane kartavya ke taraf modaa jaekai taaki vah yah samaj sake ki ve kiske liye, kis liye or kyon kartavya se bandhe hue handi frankal kaa yah kahana hai ki jivan kaa vaastavik arth swayan ke maanas main nahin balki sansar main handi usee tarah maanav ke astitva kaa asli uddeshy aatm parichay se nahin hotaryi uskaa saar aatm shreshtataa se praapt hoti handi frankal is baat ko nyaay siddh karne ke liye tark yah laate hai ki aatm parichay kabhi bhi jivan kaa aadhaar nahin ban saktaa kyunki maanav jitna use paane kaa praytn karegaa vah utana usko khoyegaqui The world should never understand the manifestation of self, nor is the world the only means to achieve self-introduction
 This implies that the meaning of life is not constant, but it does not have any ends
 Life under logotherapy we Can be found in three ways: through karma; By experiencing the value of one's Vastu; It is very beneficial to complete the first method
 Through pain, there is a need for re-expansion in the second and third ways
 This education can be given to us by nature or by culture or by experiencing someone, ie through love
 Love itself is a shield through which a person's inner personality can be watered
 No one can know a human being or Can understand until love is born
 If love is put in spiritual form, then it can see other important signs of human beings
 Not, the man whom she loves very big step i even more the way of self-introduction, which is confirmed that their power i will go two men recognize their power i teesraa tarika jo manushya ko apane jivan ke arth ko khojane main sahaayta karata hai vah he peedaashi manushya jab bhi asahaay yaa aisi paristhiti se guzarataa he jiskaa parinaam unke haath main na ho jaise: koi laailaaj beemaari, usee vakt ek insaan ko apni pahchaan ko bodh karnaa kaa bharpoor mauka miltaa he, arthath ksht ko jhelkar jivan kaa sabase bada arth paane kaa avasar miltaa handi isamen ksht ki taraf vyakti kaa nazariyaa bhi peeda ko jhelane ki takat detaa haii Frankel, Victor E

 Nannayya used Sanskrit words in his composition in the same manner as in Andhra province at that time

 Wrote some Sanskrit verses according to the rules of Yatimatri and prasamatri and also took many expansive verses found in Kannada poetry

 nannayy ne aadi parv tathaa sabha parvon kaa puraa or arany parv kaa kuch ansh tak anuwaad kiya
 Although the Andhra Mahabharata is largely a translation, Nannayya wrote some excerpts from the point of view of rasa and appropriateness, and some excerpts from which the Andhra Mahabharata seems to be an independent poem

 vah yaan jo ki antariksh athwa vyom main jane ke kaam aata he use antariksh yaan kehete hai
 Spacecraft are used for many purposes, the main ones being: aavashyaktaa or uddeshy ke anusaar antariksh yaan main bahut si uppranaliyaan pradaan kii jaati hai
 Some of the main systems are: ahale sunnat yaa sunni unhen kaha jaataa hai jo quran or paigambar mohammad sahab ke tareeke ko zindagi guzarane kaa tarika maanate hai ye naam shiya urf raafaziyo se apane ko alag paehchan bataane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa hai dakshin asia main aadhikarik taur par ahale sunnat main bade taur par teen giroh aate hai barelvi,devbandi,ahale haddees yaa salfi
 Barelvi Muheem is a sub-movement under the Sufi movement in South Asia called It is a campaign originated from the Ahle Sunnah Vall Jamaat which was started by Sunni scholar Ahmed Raza Khan Qadri from Bareilly in Rohelkhand in nineteenth and twentieth century India, 
 barelvi sunni hanfi barelvi musalamaanon kaa ek bada hissaa he jo ab bady sankhya main bharat, bangladesh, pakistan dakshin africa evam britain main sanghanit hai
 Ala Hazrat Imam Ahmed Raza Qadri, through his famous fatwa Razvia, made his significant contribution to defending traditional and orthodox Islam in India
 devbandi muhim ko vastav main ek sufi muhim jise ismail dehalavi devbandiyon ke bade aalimo qaasim nanotvi,ashraf ali thanvi,khalil ambethvi ne saudi arab kii wahabiyat ko taqalid kaa jama pahana kar ise dakshin asian musalamaanon ke saamne prastut kiya
 Most Sunnis of South Asia are Barelvi
 deobandi sunni bhi khaasi taadaad main he
 Ahle Hadiths are Sunnis who do not believe in Sufism
 They are also called Salafi because they claim to understand and believe Islam in the same way that Salaf understood the Quran and Sunnah, Salafi Sunni alias Ahle Hadith is mostly in Saudi Arabia
 And are in Qatar
 ye kisi imam kii taqalid nahin karte
 It is said that Deobandi and Wahhabi ideology has done the work of spreading fundamentalism among Muslims all over the world, although the beginning of militancy in Kashmir and Chechnya was done by the followers of Sufi cult

 Sufis played an important role in the propagation and spread of Islam in India
 He gained considerable success in the spread of Islam, because in many respects the belief systems and practice of Sufis were similar with Indian philosophical literature, especially non-violence and monotheism
 Sufi orthodox attitudes towards Islam have made it easier for Hindus to practice it
 hazrat khwaja muin-ud-ddeen chishti, kutbuddin bakhtiyaar khurma, nizaam-ud-ddeen auliya, shah jalaal-ud-deen siyuti, aamir khusro, sarkaar sabir paak, shaikh abd-ul-haq dahelvi, ashraf jahangir semnani, sarkaar vaaris paak, ata hossain phani chishti ne bharat ke vibhinn bhaagon main islam ke prasar ke liye sufiyon ko prashikshit kiya
 After the Islamic Empire was established in India, the Sufis clearly provided a touch of love and beauty, saving it from being indifferent and harsh
 The Sufi movement also attracted followers from artisan and untouchable communities; He also played an important role in bridging the gap between Islam and indigenous traditions
 Ahmed Sirhindi, a prominent member of the Naqshbandi Sufi, advocated the peaceful conversion of Hindus to Islam

 Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was the first Vice President and Second President of India
 ve bhartiya samskruti ke samvahak, prakhyat shikshavid, mahaan darshanik or ek aasthavan hindu vichaarak the
 Due to his qualities, the Government of India honored him with the highest honor Bharat Ratna in 1954
 unka janmdin bharat main shikshak diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan was born on 5 September 1888 in Tirutani village, Tamil Nadu, which is about 64 km from the then Madras
 jis parivaar main unhone janm liya vah ek brahman parivaar tha
 His place of birth has also been noted as a holy pilgrimage place
 radhakrishnan ke purakhe pehle kabhi 'sarvapalli' naamak gram main rahete the or 18veen shatabdi ke madhya main unhone tirutani gram kii ore nishkraman kiya tha
 But his ancestors wanted that there should always be a realization of the village of his birthplace along with his name
 isi kaaran unke parijan apane naam ke purv 'sarvapalli' dhaaran karne lage the
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan was a child of a poor but learned Brahmin
 unke pita kaa naam 'sarvapalli veeraswami' or mata kaa naam 'sitamma' tha
 His father worked in the revenue department
 un par bahut bade parivaar ke bharan-poshan kaa daayitv tha
 Veeraswamy had five sons and a daughter
 radhakrishnan kaa sthaan in santatiyon main doosraa tha
 His father was discharging the family with great difficulty
 is kaaran balak radhakrishnan ko bachapan main koi vishesh sukh praapt nahin hua
 Radhakrishnan's childhood was spent in religious places like Tirutani and Tirupati
 unhone pratham aath varsh tirutani main hi gujaarey
 Although his father was old-minded and had religious sentiments, he sent Radhakrishnan to study at the Christian missionary institution Lutheran Mission School, Tirupati between 1896–1900
 phir agle 4 varsh kii unki shiksha vellore main hui
 He then studied at Madras Christian College, Madras
 vah bachapan se hi medhaavi the
 During these 12 years of study, Radhakrishnan also remembered important portions of the Bible
 iske liye unhen vishisht yogyata kaa sammaan pradaan kiya gaya
 At this age, he also studied Veer Savarkar and Swami Vivekananda
 unhone 1902 main metric str kii pariksha uteern kii or unhen chaatravrutti bhi praapt hui
 After this he passed the Faculty of Arts examination in first class in 1904
 unhen manovigyaan, itihaas or ganit vishay main vishesh yogyata kii tippanee bhi ucch praptankon ke kaaran mili
 Apart from this, Christian College, Madras also gave him a scholarship
 darshanashastra main em0e0 karne ke pashchaat 1916 main ve madras residency college main darshanashastra ke sahaayak praadhyaapak niyukt hue
 Later he was also a professor in the same college
 dow radhakrishnan ne apane lekhon or bhaashanon ke madhyam se vishwa ko bhartiya darshan shaastra se parichit karaayaa
 His articles were praised all over the world
 us samay madras ke brahman pariwaron main kam umr main hi shaadi sampann ho jaati thi or radhakrishnan bhi uske apwaad nahin rahe
 In 1903, at the age of 16, he was married to Sivakamu, the sister of a distant relationship
 us samay unki patni kii aayu maatr 10 varsh kii thi
 So, after three years, his wife started living with him
 yadhyapi unki patni sivaakamu ne paramparaagat rup se shiksha praapt nahin kii thi, lekin unka telegu bhashaa par acha adhikaar tha
 She could also write and read English
 1908 main radhakrishnan dampati ko santaan ke rup main putree kii prapti hui
 In 1908, he received the degree of Bachelor of Arts in the first class and got special qualification in philosophy
 shaadi ke 6 varsh baad hi 1909 main unhone kala main snatakottar pariksha bhi uteern kar lee
 The subject of his philosophy was philosophy
 ucch adhyayan ke dauraan vah apni nijee aamadani ke liye bacchon ko tution padhaane kaa kaam bhi karte rahe
 In 1908 he also wrote a research article to obtain the title of MA
 is samay unki aayu maatr bees varsh kii thi
 This increased his knowledge of the scriptures
 sheeghra hi unhone vedon or upanishdon kaa bhi gahan adhyayan kar liya
 Apart from this, he also studied Hindi and Sanskrit language very interestingly
 shiksha kaa prabhaav jahaan prayek vyakti par nishchit rup se padataa he, vahiin shaikshik santhaan kii gunvattta bhi apana prabhaav chhodti he
 At that time Western values of life were deeply instilled within the students by Christian institutions
 yahi kaaran he ki chrishchiyan sansthaaon main adhyayan karte hue radhakrishnan ke jivan main ucch gun samahit ho gayi
 But there was also another change in them which was due to Christian institutions
 kuch log hindutvvaadi vichaaron ko hey drushti se dekhte the or unki aalochana karte the
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan took his criticism as a challenge and started to study Hindu scriptures deeply
 dow radhakrishnan yah jaananaa chaahate the ki vastutah kis samskruti ke vichaaron main chetanta he or kis samskruti ke vichaaron main jadta he? tab swaabhaavik antarpragna dwaara is baat par dridhtaa se vishwaas karnaa armbh kar diya ki bharat ke duurastha sthanon par rahane vaale garib tathaa anpadh vyakti bhi pracheen satya ko jaanate the
 For this reason Radhakrishnan came to know comparatively that Indian spirituality is very rich and criticisms of Hinduism by Christian missionaries are baseless
 isse inhone yah nishkarsh nikaala ki bhartiya samskruti dharm, gyaan or satya par aadhaarit he jo praani ko jivan kaa sachcha sandesh detii he
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan had well known that life is very short but the happiness prevailing in it is uncertain
 is kaaran vyakti ko sukh-dukh main sambhaav se rahanaa chaiye
 In fact, death is an unshakable truth, which makes the rich poor all their grass and does not make any kind of class distinction
 sachcha gyaan vahi he jo aapke andar ke agyaan ko samaapt kar saktaa he
 a life of simplistic contentment is better than the egoistic life of the rich, in whom dissatisfaction resides
 ek shant mastishk behatar he, taaliyon kii un gadgadahaton se; jo sansadon evam darbaron main sunaayi detii hai
 In fact, this is why Dr
 Radhakrishnan was able to understand the moral values of Indian culture, because he wanted to test the truth of the criticisms made by the missionaries themselves
 isiilie kaha gaya he ki aalochanaayen parishuddhi kaa kaary karti hai
 All mothers want to see higher values in their children
 isi kaaran ve bacchon ko ishwar par vishwaas rakhane, paap se dur rahane evam musiibat main phase logon kii madad karne kaa paath padhaati hai
 Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan also learned that respect for all religions has been taught in Indian culture and the sense of equality for all religions is also a unique identity of Hindu culture
 is prakaar unhone bhartiya samskruti kii vishisht pahchaan ko samajha or uske kaafii nazadik ho gayi
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan considered the whole world as a school
 unka maananaa tha ki shiksha ke dwaara hi maanav mastishk kaa sadupyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, the world should manage education as a single entity
 britain ke edinbura vishvavidhyalay main diye apane bhaashan main dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne kaha tha- "maanav ko ek hona chahie
 The complete goal of human history is the liberation of mankind only when the basis of the policies of the countries is to try to establish peace all over the world
 " dow radhakrishnan apni buddhi se paripurna vyakhyaaon, anandadaayi abhivyaktiyon or halki gudgudane vaali kahaniyon se chaatro ko mantramugdh kar dete the
 He also used to motivate his students to adopt high moral values in their conduct
 vah jis bhi vishay ko padhaate the, pehle swayan uskaa gahan adhyayan karte the
 He used to make even a serious subject like philosophy, simple, interesting and dear to his style
 1909 main 21 varsh kii umr main dow radhakrishnan ne madras presidency college main kanishtha vyaakhyaata ke taur par darshan shaastra padhaanaa prarambh kiya
 It was his best fortune that he got a livelihood suited to his nature
 yahan unhone 7 varsh tak na keval adhyaapan kaary kiya apitu swayan bhi bhartiya darshan or bhartiya dharm kaa gaharaai se adhyayan kiya
 In those days, it was necessary for the lecturer that he should also get training for teaching
 isi kaaran 1910 main radhakrishnan ne shikshan kaa prashikshan madras main lenaa armbh kar diya
 At this time, his salary was only 37 rupees
 darshan shaastra vibhaag ke tatkaaleen profesar radhakrishnan ke darshan shastreey gyaan se kaafii abhibhoot hue
 They allowed him to be absent from philosophy classes
 lekin iske badale main yah shart rakhi ki vah unke sthaan par darshanashastra kii kakshaon main padhaa den
 Then Radhakrishna gave thirteen such impressive lectures to his classmates, which surprised even those learners
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki unki vishay par gahari pakad thi, darshan shaastra ke sambandh main drushtikon spasht tha or vyaakhyaan dete samay unhone upyukt shabdon kaa chayan bhi kiya tha
 a short booklet titled "essential Elements of Psychology" by Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was also published in 1912 which was a collection of his lectures given in class
 is pustika ke dwaara unki yah yogyata pramanit hui ki "prayek pad kii vyakhya karne ke liye unke paas shabdon kaa atul bhandar to he hi, unki samaran shakti bhi atyant vilakshan he
 " jab dow radhakrishnan europe evam america pravaas se punah bharat laute to yahan ke vibhinn vishvavidhyalayon ne unhen maanad oopaadhiyaan pradaan kar unki vidvatta kaa sammaan kiya
 In the winter of 1928, he first met Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru when he came to Calcutta to attend the annual session of the Congress Party
 yadhyapi sarvapalli radhakrishnan bhartiya shaikshik seva ke sadsy hone ke kaaran kisi bhi raajnneetik sambhaashan main hissedari nahin kar sakate the, tathaapi unhone is varjana kii koi parvaah nahin kii or bhaashan diya
 In 1929, he was invited by the 'university of Manchester' to give lectures
 inhone maanchester evam landan main kai vyaakhyaan diye
 The following institutional service functions are seen in the scope of their educational achievements- sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne aisa hi kiya or thik raatri 12 baje apane sambodhan ko viraam diya
 None other than Pandit Nehru and Radhakrishnan were aware of this
 azaadi ke baad unase aagrah kiya gaya ki vah mathrubhumi kii seva ke liye vishisht rajdoot ke rup main soviet sangh ke saath rajanyik kaaryon kii purti karen
 Thus, he was chosen as the new successor of Vijayalakshmi Pandit
 pandit nehru ke is chayan par kai vyaktiyon ne aashcharya vyakt kiya ki ek darshanashastri ko rajanyik sevaaon ke liye kyon chunaa gaya? unhen yah sandeh tha ki doctor radhakrishnan kii yogyataayen saunpi gai zimmedaari ke anukool nahin hai
 But Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan later proved that he was the best Indian diplomat appointed in Moscow
 ve ek gaiyr paramparawaadi rajanyik the
 Mantras which were late at night, they used to participate in them till 10 o'clock in the night, because after that their sleeping time was over
 jab radhakrishnan ek shikshak the, tab bhi ve niyamon ke daayaron main nahin bandhe the
 He used to come 20 minutes late to class and leave ten minutes earlier
 inkaa kahana tha ki kaksha main inhen jo vyaakhyaan dena hota tha, vah 20 minute ke paryaapt samay main sampann ho jaataa tha
 Even after this, he remained the beloved and respected teacher of the students
 1952 main soviet sangh se aane ke baad doctor radhakrishnan uparashtrapati nirvaachit kiye gayi
 a new post of Vice President was created under the Constitution
 nehru ji ne is pad hetu radhakrishnan kaa chayan karke punah logon ko chaunkaa diya
 He wondered why no Congress party politician was elected for the post
 uparashtrapati ke rup main radhakrishnan ne rajyasabha main adhyaksh kaa padbhaar bhi sambhaala
 In 1952, he became the Vice President of India
 baad main pandit nehru kaa yah chayan bhi sarthak siddh hua, kyonki uparashtrapati ke rup main ek gaiyr raajnneetijna vyakti ne sabhi raajnneetigyon ko prabhavit kiya
 All the members of Parliament appreciated him for his work
 inaki sadashyata, dridhtaa or vinodi swabhaav ko log aaj bhi yaad karte hai
 The birthday of Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the second but unique President of our country, is celebrated every year as 'teacher's Day'
 is din samast desh main bharat sarkaar dwaara shreshth shikshakon ko puraskaar bhi pradaan kiya jaataa he
 Although he was conferred with the title of "sir" by the British Empire in 1931, his justification for Dr
 Radhakrishnan had ended after attaining independence

 Traditionally it is believed that the Vedas are apaurusheya and eternal, but rather the revelation of eternal truth whose validity is eternal
 vedon ko shruti mana jaataa he 
 Due to differences in religious and cultural practices and practice and due to their association with various Vedic schools, Acharyas are Brahmins
 In the sutra period, under the leadership of eminent scholars, different branches of different names of the same Veda started to be formed

 Similarly, he must have imagined the sides, months, seasons and years from the orbits of the Sun
 samay ko sookshm rup se naapane ke liye pehle shankuyantr tathaa dhoopghadiyon kaa prayog hua
 The knowledge of night time was done with the constellations

 These were prevalent in India since time immemorial

 a small hole was made in a vessel to make a water casing, which caused the vessel to sink into the water in a bell
 uske bahari bhaag par pal ankit kar die jate the
 Therefore, moments are also called watery moments
 baaluu kaa ghatiyantra bhi pani ke ghatiyantra sareekha tha, jisamen chhidr se baaluu ke girane se samay gyaat hota tha
 But all these Ghatyantras were not subtle and had practical difficulties
 vigyaan ke pradurbhaav ke saath lolak ghadiyaan tathaa tatpashchaat nai ghadiyaan, jinka ham aaj prayog karte hai, avishkrut hui
 As stated earlier, the knowledge of time is derived from the visible positions of the Sun
 saamanyat: suryoday se suryaast tak din tathaa suryaast se pun: suryoday tak raatri hoti hai, kintu tithigananaa ke liye din-raat milakar din kehalaate hai
 a revision of the midpoint of the post-meridian circle by the Sun at a place is called a visible day, and a revision relative to a stationary constellation of the Sun is called a sidereal day
 yah nakshatra roodhi ke anusaar maap kaa aadi bindu, arthath krantivrutt tathaa vishuvat vrutt kaa vasant sampaat bindu liya jaataa he
 Although the sidereal day is stationary, it is not useful for our behavior, because this view is 3 minutes 53 seconds less than the day
 drishy din kaa maan sadaa ek sa nahin rahata
 Therefore, it is difficult to tell the time of the sun from a watch
 iske do kaaran hai : ek to surya kii spasht gati sadaa ek si nahin rahati, duusare spasht surya krantivrutt main chalata dikhaai detaa he
 We need such a sun to make a timetable device, which always moves in equinoctial at a moderate speed
 aise surya ko jyotishi log jyotish-madhya-surya athwa keval madhya surya kehete hai
 Bhaskaracharya has called the difference between the equator and the middle sun of the ecliptic, the difference between the Udayantra and the ecliptic, the middle sun and the apparent sun
 yadi jyotish-madhya surya main udayantar tathaa bhujaantar sanskaar kar den, to vah drishy surya ho jayega
 In modern terminology, simultaneous rites of Udayantar and Bhujantar are called time critics
 yah hamaari ghadiyon ke samay tathaa drishy surya ke samay ke antar ke tulya hota he
 Time reviewer can be calculated only per day by mathematics
 aajkal prakashit honevaale navik panchang main, iskaa pratidin kaa maan diya rahata he
 Thus we can find the time of visible sun whenever we want with our watches
 iskaa jyotish main bahut upyog hota he
 Inversely: We can correct the time of our clocks by observing the mean time of the sun, by adding or subtracting the time criterion of it, by observing the skipping of the north or midpoint of the sun
 2500BC
 We made modern watches to measure time, then it was found that due to cold and heat these watches do not give proper time due to shrinking and spreading of metal parts
 ab hamaare saamne yah samasya thi ki ham apni yantric ghadiyon kii sookshm ashuddhiyon ko kaise jaane? yadhyapi surya ke udhrv yamyottar langhan kii vidhi se ham apni ghadiyon kii ashuddhi jaan sakate the, tathaapi surya ke udhrv yamyottar langhan kaa vedh swayan kuch vilsht hai tathaa surya ke bimb ke vishaal hone ke kaaran usamen vedhakarta kii vyaktigat truti kii adhik sambhaavna he
 The second difficulty was that the time of our mean-sun-clock had no direct relation with the position of the celestial bodies
 isi kami kii purti ke liye nakshatra ghadi kaa nirmaan kiya gaya, jo nakshatra samay bataati thi
 Its 24 hours are equal to the time of one orbit of the Earth's own axis, or one revolving of the north or the midpoint of the spring point
 21 march ke lagbhag, basantpaat bindu hamaare drishy-surya ke saath udhrv yamyottar langhan karata he
 At that time the time of the sidereal clock is zero hour, zero minute, zero second
 hamaari ghadiyon main us samay 12 bajte hai
 In the afternoon on the second day, the time for the sidereal clock will be 4 minutes
 anya kisi bhi nichit din madhya-surya ke samay ko ham anupaat se nakshatra sam main, yaa nakshatra samay ko madhya surya ke samay main, parivartit kar sakate hai
 Sailor almanacs have tables of this type of time conversion
 is prakaar yadi hamen kisi prakaar shuddh samay denevaali nakshatra ghadi mil jaae, te hamen apni madhya ghadi ke samay ko shuddh rakh sakate hai
 Although the sidereal clock is also mechanical and it also undergoes mechanical error, it can be purified daily, as it has direct relation to the position of celestial bodies
 vah is prakaar he : koi grah va tara udhrv yamyottar bindu se pachim kii ore khagoleey dhruv par jo kone banaata he, use kalkon kehete hai
 Thus, the constellation is the spring of some spring
 kisi tara vaa grah kaa vishuvaansh basantpaat se uski vishuvatvritiya duuri hoti he
 Since the angle is known by the arc of the equinoctoid, when the planet or star is at the posterior meridian, its equinox will be equal to the sidereal time
 badakhshaan pamir parvaton ke ilaake main sthit madhya asia kaa ek aitihaasik kshetra he jo aadhunik afghanistan ke purvottaree or aadhunik tajikistan ke dakshinpurvi bhaagon par vistrut tha

 'badakhshaan' kshetra kaa naam iran ke saasaani samrajya ne diya tha

 'badakhshaan' shabd main 'kh' akshar ke uccharan par dhyaan den kyonki yah bina bindu vaale 'kha' se zaraa bhinn he
 It is pronounced with 'khab' and 'kha' for 'khad'
 badakhshaan ke log vividh samudaayon se sambandh rakhte hai
 There are a large number of Tajik people and minority communities of Uzbek and Kyrgyz also live here
 is kshetra main kai pamiri bhashaaon ke bolne vaale milte hai
 In the 20th century, a separate Pamiri community became recognized among the Pamiri speakers in kuhistoni-badakhshan Autonomous Province of Tajikistan

 iqbaal ansaari, naam se ek muslim doctor ke awaas se baari maatra main avaidh hathiyaaron kii baramadagi hoti hai
 Due to which the police accuse him of being an ISI agent and a riot plotter
 giraftaar ansaari kii peshi ke liye mumbai vishesh nyaayalay bulaayaa jaataa hai, lekin chandangarh se police gheraabandi ke bich nikalwane baavjood unpar kisi agyaat dal kaa hamalaa hota he
 The police somehow manages to save him, but by then serious damage has been done
 police chif, asipi naidu ko vishesh nyaayalay kii sunwaayee par ansaari ko peshi par chandangarh se laane ke liye paanch pulicekarmiyon kii niyukti kii jimmedaari milti he
 The team chief is appointed by DCP Anant Srivastava, who is an honest police officer but has not been able to make any special impact in his career so far except to reject corrupt practices
 vah is abhiyaan ko isliye raji hota he ki kisi tarah apane karier main safal hone par use adishnal kamishnar kii padonnati mili taaki uske sevaayen evam prayaason kaa uchit sammaan mil sake
 His team now includes senior inspector Shekhar Verma who is a corrupt policeman, co-inspectors Ashwin Gupte and two constables Kamlesh Sawant and Gajanan Mhatre
 lekin mumbai se prasthaan se purv hi unke haathon ek photographer pakadaa jaataa hai jo gupt rup se unki tasviren le rahaa tha par unase ve kuch ugalva nahin pate
 Actually he was spying on the team at the behest of Yashwant Angre
 lekin police in donon ke bich jude sutara par kuch kaarywai karti ongre us photographer or uske parivaar ko unke telephone resiver se jude visphotak ke jariye dhamaakaa kar maar daalata he
 Anant reaches Chandangarh with his team that the police get the news of the disclosure of some suspicious activities in his school estate by a school teacher named Mahalaxmi
 anant or uski team ko sthaneey police ke saath jaanch main aatankiyon ke kamare se shav baraamad hote hai
 When the raids continue in the room, the phone rings, but Anant makes sure to carefully before picking up the phone receiver, as a result of which he detects the explosive attached to the receiver, removing it and receiving the phone
 No answer anant kaa vishwaas pukhta hota hai ki koi aisa giroh he jinhen unke prayek gatividhiyon or is abhiyaan kii jaankaree praapt he, jisamen unhen tatkaal yojana main badlaav lene kaa faisla karnaa padataa he
 During his return to the police station, Ansari's mother comes to meet Anant, pleading not to kill him in the middle of the road and take him straight to court and get him justice
 anant use aashwast karaata he use uske bete se jarur milwaayegaa
 At the same time, Anant gets an unknown call from Angre, but he does not recognize and even attempts to trace the call fail
 par tabhi usee line par uski patni or beti kii aawaaj sunai padati hai
 Anant immediately calls the house, but after finding the situation normal, it is understood that Angre had just used the recording tape to scare him
 anant apni team main mahalakshami ko saath lekar mumbai ko ravaanaa hi hote hai ki haive par lagi lambey jam par unako ruknaa padataa he
 After going beyond this jam, we have to walk through a crude path that they face a huge crowd in the form of cattle fair
 raste se maweshiyon or logon ko hataate hue anant ko tabhi ongre kaa phone aata hai joki ki usee ke aas-paas hone kaa ehsaas karaata hai
 But Anant finds him and chases him along with Ashwin
 shekhar verma, gypsy se utar ansaari kii badi vine par chadh jaataa he taaki donon ore se suraksha kii ja sake
 Angre escapes the grip of Anant by creating a tremendous stampede at the fair
 jaise hi anant apni team ke saath aage badhata he ki shekhar ko ehsaas hota he ki vine ke dekharekh kii hadabadi main jeep asurakshit rah gai thi
 Immediately after stopping the jeep, Shekhar peeps down the vehicle and then sees an explosive
 phir vah sabhi ko peeche hatane ko kehete hue bhaagta hi hai ki jeep dhamaake se dhawast ho jaati he lekin uske jabardast dhakke se vine kii ingine par bura asar padataa he
 Anant then along with the team pushes the van away from the highway, reaches a house through the deserted path, decides to repair the van and stop and then proceed
 anant ab maujuuda sthiti ke bare bataane naidu ko phone karata he or sthanadi kaa pataa dekar atirikt police sahaayta bhejne ko kahati he
 Anant tries to identify the unknown person seen in the fair at that house, then he remembers Angre, who is the most corrupt and ruthless ex-officer of his department
 jise paanch nirdosho kii hatya karne ke aparaadh main anant use jail bhejkar police vibhaag se barkhaast karata hai
 Then the team sees a police van, but what they consider to be their support team, they actually prove to be Angre's killers
 chand minuton main baari golibari chalati he or javaabi bachaav main anant kii team ke saare goli-kaartoos kam pad jate hai
 At the same time, the man from Angre asks the police sergeant to release Ansari by throwing the driver
 shekhar ko or koi vikalp samaj na aane par ansaari ko khinch baahar karne kii cheshtaa hi karata ki anant uski raah roktaa hai
 And then there is an altercation between the two, in which, according to Shekhar, his chief Anant is an insignificant policeman who will ignore everyone's life and defend his moral ideals
 bahes ko ulajhate dekh antat anant or aswin apni pistaulen shekhar par taan dete hai lekin tab ansaari bifarte hue kah detaa he ki yahaan aatankwaadi uski rihaai ke liye nahin balki maarane aae hai
 According to him, he is just an ordinary doctor from Chandangarh, who had honestly reconciled between his profession and family
 unheen dinon danga peediton kii ilaaj ke dauraan bhaskar joshi naam ke patrkaar se mulaakaat hoti he jise pataa he ki is sampradayik dangon kaa asal jimmevaar vidhayak devdhar hi he jo apane khilaaf khadey in saamaajik kaaryakarta ko maar apane jurm chhipaana chahta hai
 Bhaskar comes to Dr
 Ansari in preparation of this strong evidence, because the conclusions of the dead whom he is investigating will only be opposed to Deodhar
 ansaari vah report bhaskar ko saunpta he lekin uske prakashit hone ke pehle hi bhaskar ghaatak hamale main maaraa jaataa he or phone par devdhar kii file dene kii dhamkiyaan di jaati he
 Ansari refuses to give the file and as a result the riots and the collusion of corrupt police destroy his house and kill the entire family and are declared terrorists without false evidence
 isi bich, ongre or uske aadmi ghar andar pahunchakar anant or baakiyon par bandook taan hi dete hai sivaay shekhar or aswin ke jo andhere kaa laabh uthaakar fouran ansaari ko ghar peeche ke warehouse main chhip jate hai
 While Angre's men search the house, Angre tells Anant how to avenge Bejjati at his hands because according to him Anant cares about his duties and ideals more than his life
 vahiin ongre ke aadmi ghar kii chaanbin karte huue warehouse pahonchte hai
 Angre could enter with them that Ashwin, standing outside on the cylinders filled with flammable gas kept there, shot a fatal blast at him, killing some goons
 is afratfari main team police vine par jald savaar hokar bhaagti hi hai ki ongre kii chalaai goli se ansaari buree tarah ghayal hota he
 That's when Anant is asked by Naidu to shoot Ansari
 anant samaj jaataa he ki naidu bhi ek bhrasht pulicekarmi hai jo devdhar kaa kaam karata hai or anant kii har gatividhiyon kii jaankaree ongre ko detaa hai
 Anant along with his team gets the injured Ansari admitted to the local hospital, the doctors save his life but he also fears that his condition will worsen
 anant apni team ke sadasyon ko is abhiyaan se mukt hone ko kehete he kyonki jin logon ne is mishan par jane ko kaha ve swayan ise safal nahin hone dena chaahate
 They say that they will carry out this till the end
 tab shekhar beeti raat ko hui budtameezi kii maafee maangata he or vah bhi unke saath aakhir tak chalane kii jid karata he taaki ek baar khud ko eemaandaar police sabit kar saken
 And then other members also give their opinion
 vahiin sthaneey police anant kii team ko police thane le jaati he jahaan unhen kaha jaataa he ki unako vishram dene or ansaari kii jimmedaari se mukt karaae jane kaa aadesh praapt he
 Anant expresses his indignation over the responsibility given to the officer, how unscrupulous politician like Deodhar, a corrupt policeman who is involved in corruption, Naidu dictates to his department
 officer unhen gaur karte hue unki madad kaa aashwaasan detaa he or naidu se mili kaal par galat logon ko giraftaar kiye jane kii galatfahami jataata he
 At the same time, on the failure of Angre and Naidu, against the team of Minister Deodhar Anant, publicity of the news group propagates to the public that this team has been sold and has joined the ISI relationship
 doordarshan or anya samachar madhyamon se gumraah ek jan-samooh usee aspataal ke yahaan pahunch ansaari ko unke supurd karne ke liye patharav karti he
 Anant goes among them without protesting and says that those who are not aware of the truth, such corrupt politicians confuse them and serve their interest
 yahaan anant kii team ko mumbai ravaanaa hone ke liye ek kaaryvahak rail suvidha milti he
 But before taking their precautions, Angre arrives at the station with his armed men on the same train
 par tabhi hawaldaar kamalesh ko stesan baahar police vine bhagaate dekh ongre va uske aadmi goliyaan barasaane ke jhaanse main funsate hai or unheen ke peeth peeche shekhar train par kabja jamaate hue vahiin chhipe anya sadasyon ko bachaate hue anant baaki aatankiyon par golibari karata he
 Kamlesh tries to catch the van Roque train near the tracks but is eventually killed by Angre's shot
 mumbai pahunchakar jab ansaari ko aspataal main ilaaj ke liye laayaa jaataa he doctor uske gambhir sthiti ko dekhte hue mrit ghoshit karte hai
 At the same time, Ansari's mother feels that Anant has deliberately ignored her prayers and slaps her in a fit of angry journalists before her accountability
 baavjood agali subah anant apni team ke saath ansaari kaa sammaan sahit antim sanskaar karaati he, or media ke samaksh is cese kii dubaara kaarywai kaa elaan karti hai
 Angered by the statement of Anant in the media, the brother-in-law threatens him to stay within his limits, but Anant does not come under his influence
 yahaan anant apni team ko patrkaar bhaskar ke bete ke jariye us ke thikaane ko kisi prakaar dundh nikaalati hai
 Shekhar and Mahalaxmi arrive at the grand post-office to find the file where they are confronted by the already ambushed Angre
 sthiti bigadane se pehle shekhar vah fil mahalakshami ko dekar anant ko saunpane kaa jimmaa detaa he or shekhar tab ongre ke aadamiyon se bhid jaataa he
 After somehow transporting Shekhar to the nearest stadium, he realizes that Mahalaxmi is Angre's girlfriend who has captured this file on his own information
 shekhar marane se pehle hi anant ko kaal karata he jisase maaloom ho jaataa he ki mahalakshami ongre kii jasoos he or phir shekhar ongre ke hatyaron ke chalaai golibari main shahid hota he
 The next day, Anant and Ashwin chase Mahalaxmi and find Angre
 lekin golibari kii muthbhed main ongre mahalakshami ko apni aad main lekar use bhi maar detaa hai
 Anant then chases Angre with the help of other policemen and surrounds him, and before arresting Anant impulsively beats Andre and forces him into police
 baraamad file kii pukhta sabooton ke maddenjar nyaayalay ongre, devdhar or naidu par vibhinn sangeen aparaadhon main sanlipt hone kaa dand qaraar detii hai
 While carrying the imprisonment, Angre finds the frame to frame the handcuffs of the van he was taken from
 khud ko fouran chhudaate hue, ongre hawaldaar par hamalaa kar, raifal chhinte hue vine ko roktaa he
 Till then, as Ashwin comes out of the van, Angre shoots a rifle at him
 ongre trigar khinchataa he, lekin goli na hone par chalaa nahin paata
 As soon as Angre surrenders by putting the gun to his foolish sense, Ashwin stains two bullets on Angre and reveals the same intentionally opened before showing the bolts
 aswin tab hawaldaar ko puure ghatnakram ke jaruri nirdesh detaa hai or apane varisht afasar ko phone par ongre ke hiraasat se bhaagane or aatmaraksha main goli chalaane kii durghatana main buree tarah ghayal hone kii soochna detaa he

 Accepting Muhammad as the last messenger of Allah is one of the central beliefs of Islam
 Shahada is a basic Islamic practice, proclaiming that Allah is One, and Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam is the apostle sent by Allah
 This declaration is subtly like this: "la Ilaha Ilallah Muhammadun Rasulullah" means "there are no Mabuds, except Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah"
 In passages like 3: 132, 48:29 and 66: 1 in the Quran, Muhammad is called Rasul, Prophet, and the Quran asks people to follow him, makka ke sammanit kuraishi parivaar main lagbhag 570 i0 main paidaa hue, hazarat mohammad ko sthaneey logon ne "al-amin" kaa sheershak diya tha | 40 saal kii umr main, mohammad ko hira naamak gufa main quran kaa pehla maukhik prakaashan praapt hua tha | iske baad, unhen 23 varsho kii avadhi main puraa kuran kaa khulaasa hua tha | muslimon kaa maananaa he ki mohammad se allaah ne akeshwarwad kaa prachaar karne or murti puja ko mudrit karne ke liye kaha tha, jiskaa abhyaas purvi arab main kiya jaataa tha makka main nae parivartit musalamaanon ke utpeedan or madina pratinidhimandal ke nimantran par, mohammad or unke anuyaayi 622 i0 main madina chale gaye the, is ghatana ko hizrat kaha jaataa hai | hazarat mohammad ke jivan kaa mahatvapurn mode hizrat, islamic calendar hijri kii shuruyaat ko chihnit karata he

 Was established In 630 AD, Muhammad Sah with his followers marched on Mecca, the people of Mecca were defeated in the war and Mecca came under the control of the Muslims
 Kaaba Sharif was declared a holy place of Islam

 In childhood, he was called by two names, his mother used to call him Muhammad and grandfather Abdul Muttalib called him Ahmed
 He was a member of the Banu Hashim clan, a respected branch of the prestigious and influential Qureshi tribe
 According to Islamic books, before the birth of Muhammad, his mother had seen many spasms, in which he was told about his godliness and spiritual significance
 One of them is the following: "ootiyat ummuhu fil manaami faki-l laha annaki ha-m-lat sayyidal aalami-na va kheral variyati fa-sammihu mohammadan ija va-ja-atahu satu hmdu biha0" Muhammad was orphaned at a young age
 a few months before the birth of Hazrat, Hazrat Abdullah left for Palestine and al-sham with a trading caravan
 Due to the difficult journey and illness, he stayed for rest in the last leg of the journey, the village of his paternal grandmother Salma Bint Amr, who was in Medina, and the convoy left him behind and left for Mecca City
 After receiving news of Abdullah's illness by the caravan, Hazrat Abdul Mutallib sent his elder son al-harit to Medina, but after leaving there al-harit learned that his brother had died a month after the illness
 , And was buried at darun-nabiya

 According to a custom, Allah’s Rasul has said that "I am the best speaking Arab, so i was born in Quraysh and grew up in Saad"
 | In Bani Saad, Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam spent the first five years of his life with his foster-mother Halima Saadia

 " Muhammad was a monogram for 25 years

 Lord Shankar was very pleased to hear the episode of Parvati's strong love with the Saptarishis
 saptarishiyon ne shiv ji or parvati ke vivaah kaa lagn muhoort aadi nishchit kar diya
 On a certain day, Shiva took a procession and came to the Himalayas home
