 The Hakhamani dynasty or the Ajmid Empire was a ruling dynasty of ancient Iran

 After this, such a large empire was able to establish only Sasani rulers
 is vansh kaa patan sikandar ke akraman se san 330 isapurv main hua tha, jiske baad iske pradeshon par unani prabhutv sthapit ho gaya tha
 In the west, this empire is remembered for its authority over Egypt and Babylon, war with Greece and cooperation in the construction of the temple of the Jews

 This dynasty is said to be the basis of the culture of Iranians who speak the modern Persian language

 Kuru has been an extremely majestic king who was the father of the Kauravas in the Mahabharata, in his name Kuru was one of the 16 Mahajanapadas of ancient India
 iskaa kshetra aadhunik haryana ke ird-gird tha
 Its capital was probably Hastinapur or Indraprastha

 At the time when the Hakhamani or Ajmeed rulers took power, the Meedis were the most powerful people in Iran at that time

 These people fought against Assyria
 isapurv san 559 main jab kuru vanshanugat rup se anshaan kaa raja bana to usne meed prabhutv sweekaar karne se manaa kar diya or mid samrajya ke kilaaf vidroh kar diya
 In 549 BCE, he captured Hamadan, the capital of the med king Astyagas
 usne apane ko paras kaa shah ghoshit kar diya or mid samrajya ko apana sahyogi rajya bana diya
 This changed the relationship of Medea and Persia completely, and Persia became the center of Iranian sovereignty for centuries to come
 kaha jaataa he ki kurosh media ke raja astyagas kaa rishte main naati lagata tha
 The absence of a father-son relationship between kings in the Hakhamani dynasty always leads to differences among historians
 is sattapalat ke baad, iske vipareet jo ki us samay ke baaqi pashchimi iran ke raajaaon ke saath hota tha - kuru ne baaqi chote samrajyon kii adheenta yaa barabari bhi sweekaar nahin kii or samrajya vistaar main jute gaya

 It is said that he committed suicide by hearing the news of an insurgency in the center of the Persian region

 He had instigated people against the taxes imposed on the Persian people by claiming that he was the younger brother of Kambojia
 ye baat sahi thi ki kurosh or kambojia ke samay irani janata ne atyadhik ladayeeyaa ladi thim or iskaa kharch janata par lagaae karon se aata tha
 But within few days Dara killed Gaumata and became Shah

 After this, Alexander tried to capture Dara but it did not directly benefit him

 Alexander's empire had swallowed the entire Persian empire

 It was held at the historic site of Persepolis and Pasargade, to which many heads of state were invited and costing crores of rupees
