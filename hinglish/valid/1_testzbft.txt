 Most of them have been fragmented or aces are two people who believe in them, but the main conflict is in the 'first century BC opinion and' fourth century AD opinion '

 It is said that Vidyottama vowed that whoever defeated him in debate would marry him
 jab vidyottama ne shastrarth main sabhi vidwaanon ko haraa diya to apmaan se dukhi kuch vidwaanon ne kalidas se uskaa shastrarth karaayaa
 Vidyottama used to ask esoteric questions in the silent vocabulary, which Kalidas used to answer with his intelligence only by silent gestures
 vidyottama ko lagata tha ki kalidas gudh prashn kaa gudh jawaab de rahe hai
 For example, Vidyottama showed an open hand as a question, and Kalidas felt that it was threatening to slap him
 uske jawaab main kalidas ne ghunsa dikhaaya to vidyottama ko laga ki vah kah rahaa he ki paanchon indriyaan bhale hi alag hon, sabhi ek man ke dwaara sanchalit hai

 Vidyottama was surprised and said - Asti kashchid vagvishishtha

 inamen bhi rutusanhaar ko pro kith andeh ke saath kalidas kii rachana sweekaar karte hai
 Malavikagnimitram is the first creation of Kalidasa, with the story of King Agnimitra
 agnimitra ek nirvasit naukar kii beti malvika ke chitra ke prem karne lagata he
 When Agnimitra's wife comes to know about this, she puts Malavika in jail

 After much apology, the sage softened the curse a bit, saying that everything would be missed as soon as the king's ring showed him
 lekin rajdhani jate hue raste main vah anguthi kho jaati he
 The situation became more serious when Shakuntala came to know that she was pregnant
 shakuntla lakh gidgidai lekin raja ne use pahchaanane se inkaar kar diya
 When a fisherman showed the ring, the king remembered everything and the king adopted Shakuntala
 shakuntla shringaar ras se bhare sundar kaavyon kaa ek anupam naatak he

 naatakkaar or kavi ke alaava kalidas jyotish ke bhi visheshgy maane jate hai
 Answer: Kalidas is credited for the creation of an astrological book called Kalamritam
 aisa mana jaataa he ki kaali devi kii puja se unhen jyotish kaa gyaan mila
 The prophecies made in this booklet proved to be true
 kalidas ko kavikulguru, kanishtikadhishthit or kavitaakaminivilas jaisi prashanshatmak oopaadhiyaan pradaan kii gayi hai jo unke kavyagat vishistataaon se abhibhoot hokar hi di gayi hai
 The specifics of Kalidasa's poetry can be described as follows: kalidas vaidarbhi reeti ke kavi hai or unhone prasad gun se purna lalit shabdayojna kaa prayog kiya he
 Prasad is a symptom of quality - "the quality that pervades the mind in the same way as fire ignites in dry fuel wood" and this is the specialty of Kalidasa's language
 kalidas kii bhashaa madhur naad sundari se yukt he or samaason kaa alpaprayog, padon kaa samuchit sthaan par nivesh, shabdalankaron kaa swaabhaavik prayog ityadi gunon ke kaaran usamen pravaah or pranjalata vidyaman he

 After the First World War, the defeated Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles on 28 June 1919
 isaki vajah se germany ko apni bhoomi ke ek bade hisse se haath dhonaa padaa, duusare rajyon par kabja karne kii paabandi laga di gayi, unki sena kaa aakaar simit kar diya gaya or baari kshatipurti thope di gayi
 The Treaty of Versailles was forced on Germany
 is kaaran adolf hitler or anya german log ise apmanjanak maanate the or is tarah se yah sandhi dwitiya vishwayuddh ke kaarnon main se ek thi
 The Paris Peace Conference drafted and signed several treaties and agreements, but in all these treaties the Treaty of Versailles with Germany is important in many respects and prominent in all treaties
 chaar maheene ke parishram ke baad sandhi kaa masavida taiyaar hua
 The treaty, written in 230 pages, was divided into 15 parts and contained 440 sections
 6 may, 1919 ko yah sammelan ke sammukh pesh hui or sweekrut ho gayi
 On 30 April, the German delegation led by Foreign Minister Count Fon Brockdouf Rantaju reached Versailles
 pratinidhiyon ko trayanan pales hotel main tehraaya gaya
 The officers of the Allies were looking after their security
 hotel ko kantedaar taron se gher diya gaya tha or german pratinidhiyon ko manaahi kar di gayi thi ki ve mitrarashtron ke kisi pratinidhi yaa kisi patrkaar se kisi prakaar kaa sampark rakhen
 On 7 May, the Climes presented a treaty to the German delegation in front of other delegations, in front of the German delegation
 is masavide par vichaar-vimarsh karne ke liye unhen keval do saptaah kaa samay diya gaya
 Germany had to sign the treaty anyway
 german raajnneetigyon ne gambhirtha ke saath sandhi ke masavide par vichaar kiya or 26 dinon ke baad apni taraf se saath hajaar shabdon kaa ek virdohi prastaav prastut kiya
 Germany had complained that the terms on which it had surrendered violated those principles in the proposed treaty
 unka kahana tha ki germany kii nayi sarkaar purna rup se prajatantric he or rashtrasang kii sadsyta ke liye icchhuk he
 The condition of disarmament should be applied not only to Germany but to all states
 vishwayuddh ke liye ekmaatr germany ko jimmedaar tehraana galat he
 The German proposal also stated that it is impossible to assume all the terms of the treaty
 ek bade raashtra ko kuchalakar tathaa use gulam banaakar sthaayee shanti sthapit nahin kii ja sakati
 The Allies considered the proposals of Germany and after some minor changes Germany was asked to sign the revised treaty within five days
 is baar germany ko yah avasar nahin diya gaya ki vah sandhi ke masavide ke sambandh main kisi prakaar kaa sanshodhan yaa nivedan prastut kar sake
 The Allies had made it clear that not signing would mean a re-invasion of Germany
 ant main german sarkaar ne sandhi par hastakshar karnaa sweekaar kar liye
 The formation and organization of the League of Nations was an extremely important part of the Treaty of Versailles
 sandhi ke pratham bhaag kaa sambandh isi se he
 It was originally President Wilson's creation
 uskaa khyaal tha ki rashtrasang ko shanti-sammelan kii sabase mahaan kriti honi chahie
 Lloyd George wrote that Wilson used to give the most importance to only the part of the peace treaties which had the League of Nations
 iske liye vah koi bhi tyaag karne ke liye taiyaar tha or ant main uske kathin prayaas se hi rashtrasang kaa nirmaan hua
 Barring Wilson, other representatives of the Allied view were of the view that it was not necessary to put the matters of the League under the Treaty of Versailles
 antatah wilson kii baat maan lee gayi or rashtrasang ke samvidhan ko varsay-sandhi ke antargat hi rakh diya gaya
 The first 26 sections of the Treaty of Versailles are the constitution of the League of Nations, whose purpose was to increase international cooperation and to maintain international peace and security
 alss-lauren pradesh : varsay-sandhi dwaara pradeshik parivartan karke germany kaa ang-bhang kar diya gaya
 In 1871, Germany seized the territory of elsse-laurent from France
 sabon ne ek swar se is baat ko sweekaar kiya ki yah ek galat kaam hua tha or iskaa ant aavashyak he
 Hence, the terms of the treaty were given back to the territories of alsace-lorraine to France
 rinland : france kii suraksha kii drushti se germany ke rinland main mitra rashtron kii sena 15 varshon tak rahegi tathaa rin nadi ke aas-paas ke kshetra ko sthai rup se nihshastr kar diya jaae taaki germany kisi prakaar kii kilabandi na kar sake
 Saar region: Saar region was famous for the coal field in Germany
 is pradesh kii shashan vyavastha kii jimmevary rashtrasang ko saunp di gai kintu koyale kii khaanon kaa swaamitv france ko diya gaya
 It was also decided that after 15 years a referendum would decide whether the people of the Saar region would stay with Germany or with France
 yadi saravasi germany ke saath milane kii ichha prakat karen to germany france ko nishchit mulya dekar khaanon ko punah kharid le
 Receipt of Belgium and Denmark: The territories of Uppen Marshnet and Malamedi were reduced to Belgium
 shleshwig main janamat sangrah karke uskaa uttari bhaag denmark ko de diya gaya
 Germany's eastern border: Germany suffered the most on the eastern border
 mitra rashtron ne swatantra poland rajya ke nirmaan kaa nirnay kiya
 Danzing was converted into an independent city and kept under the protection of the League of Nations
 poland ko samudri maarg dene ke liye dajing ke bandargah kaa upyog karne kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 The port of Memel was transferred from Germany to Lithuania
 germany ne checkoslovakia ke rajya ko manyata di
 Thus under the territorial system, Germany had to lose 25 thousand square miles of territory and a population of 70 lakhs
 german upnivesh sambandhi vyavastha : mitra raashtra german upniveshon ko apane-apane samrajya main milanaa chaahate the kintu wilson ne iskaa kadaa virodh kiya
 Allies introduced the patronage system due to Wilson's opposition
 iskaa aashay yah tha ki jo desh bahut pichde hue he unka samuchit kalyaan va vikaas karnaa
 The form of holy heritage in civilized nations should be given by the League of Nations for its advancement
 Mindet vyavastha ke tahat germany ko apni sabhi upnivesh chhodane pade or unhen mitra-rashtron ke sangrakshan main rakhaa gaya
 Many islands in the Pacific Ocean and colonies in the African continents were lost to Germany
 german sena kii adhiktam sankhya ek lakh kar di gai
 Compulsory military service was banned
 hawaii jahaajon ko pratibandhit kar diya gaya
 In addition, naval power was also limited
 germany kii nausena ke keval 6 yudhpot rakhane kii ijaajat di gai
 There was talk of handing the submarines to the Allies
 nihshastreekaran kii is vyavastha kaa paalan karwaane tathaa nigaraanee rakhane ke liye germany ke kharch par mitra rashtron kaa ek sainik ayog sthapit kiya gaya
 Thus, Germany was crippled in military terms
 varsay sandhi kii 231veen dhara ke tahat germany va uske sahyogi rajyon ko yuddh ke liye ek maatr jimmedaar mana gaya
 Therefore, for the compensation that the Allies had to bear in the war, Germany was asked to compensate the Allies by 1921
 mitra rashtron ko germany se kuch vastu ke aayaat-niryaat par vishesh suvidhaayen di gai
 The Nile Canal was internationalized and left open to all ships
 sandhi kii 231veen dhara ke anusaar sari kshati or yuddh ke liye germany ko uttaradaayi tehraaya gaya
 The establishment of the League of Nations under the political system was an important part of the Treaty of Warsaw
 wilson ke prabhaav ke kaaran hi rashtrasang kii dhaaraon ko varsay kii sandhi main rakhaa gaya
 The purpose of the League of Nations was to establish international cooperation and security
 vishwa itihaas main hui anek sandhiyon main varsay kii sandhi sarvaadhik varnit or vivaadit rahi he
 In fact, this treaty deeply influenced the course of world history
 in sandhi kii teevr aalochana kii jaati he or is dwitiya vishwayuddh ke beej ke rup main samajha jaataa he
 Criticism of this treaty can be seen under the following points- 1
 aropit sandhi : varsay kii sandhi ko “ek laadi gai shanti” kii sangya arthath “aropit sandhi” ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Germany was not accommodated in the conference when drafting the treaty
 yah mitra rashtron kaa aadesh tha jise sweekaar karne ke atirikt germany ke samaksh koi doosraa upaay nahin tha
 They were also threatened by the German representatives, if they did not sign the treaty within five days, they would be attacked again
 atah germany ke man main yah baat baith gai ki yah aropit sandhi he jise maanane ke liye vah baadhya nahin he
 This is the reason why Germany later turned down the treaty provisions
 2
 jansadharan kii shanti nahin, rajanyikon kii shaanti : varsay kii sandhi main ullekith praavdhaan jansadharan ke hit or aakankshaon ko puraa nahin kar sake
 There were many regional arrangements that needed to be amended
 kshatipurti main kai aise praavdhaan kiye gaye the jo europe ke audyogic punerjeevan ko vinaashkari aghat pahuchaaye bina vasuul nahin kiye ja sakate the
 In this way, this treaty of peace of the public does not complete
 3
 kathor evam apmanjanak sharten : varsay kii sandhi dwaara germany ko chhin-bhinn kar diya gaya, upnivesh chin aarthik rup se pangu bana diya gaya, aarthik sansadhano par duusare rashtron kaa swaamitv sthapit kar diya gaya or sainik drushti se use aapng bana diya gaya
 The condition of compensation was very harsh and humiliating
 kshatipurti kii rakam adaa na karne kii sthiti main germany ke kshetron par kabja karne kii baat kii gai
 In fact, the conquering nation imposed harsh conditions on Germany under retaliation
 sandhi kii sharte itani kathor thi ki koi bhi swabhimani, susanskrit raashtra ise sahan nahin kar saktaa tha
 In Churchill's words, "its economic conditions were stigmatized and ill-informed to the extent that they made it manifestly meaningless
" ” 4
 The treaty was harsh in the wrong places and unfairly soft: The treaty was not only unusually harsh, but it was harsh in the wrong places and unfairly soft
 tathakthith yuddh aparaadh sambandhi praavdhaanon germany dwaara sweekrut karaane kaa praytn yatharth se pare tha kyonki jaisaa david thamsan ne kaha “is baat kaa ullekh aise masaude main shaamil karke jis par hastakshar karne ke liye german pratinidhi vivash kiye gaye naiki uttardaayitv kii bhaavana utpann nahin kar sakate the
 “the second compensation was also demanded in improbable amounts and its huge amount was fixed without any serious consideration
 aarthik drushti se yah sampada germany ke liye chukaana tathaa mitra rashtron ke liye praapt karnaa kaise sambhav hoga, iskaa vishleshan nahin kiya gaya tha
 Undoubtedly, the entire size of the punishment and compensation was inconsiderate and impractical
 uparyukt sabhi prakaar kii anaavashyak kathorataayen germany ke rashtriya asantosh va krodh ko abhivyakti karne kii uski kshamta ke viruddh koi pruthak kadam nahin uthaaya gaya
 This treaty was unfairly soft, it was hardly appropriate to rule the 'essence region' by the League of Nations for 15 years and return it to Germany in 1935
 rinland par 15 varsh tak mitra rashtron kaa adhikaar bhi khokhla siddh hua
 5
 Retaliatory Treaty: The conquering nations imposed harsh terms on Germany by adopting a vengeful attitude
 france apni puraani paraajay or ampan kaa badla lenaa chaah rahaa tha us drushti se sandhi main germany ke saath adhiktam kathor praavdhaan kiye gaye
 6
 Abusive Treaty: This treaty was a cause of national humiliation for Germany
 kaisar wiliam kii apadasta, baari kshati purti raashi kii vasuuli
 Allied states' authority on German shores, Karkhono, rivers, etc
, and the presence of armies in Germany, the division of Germany, the plunder of the colonies by friendly countries and discriminatory, unequal, unjust conditions, etc
 were all derogatory
 sandhi patron par hastakshar ke liye aane vaale german pratinidhiyon ke saath klemensho kaa abhadra vyavhar, unhen kaidiyon ke saamaan rakhana, janata dwaara gaaliyaan, sade hue fal, inte,pathar ko un par phekna adi pratinidhiyon kaa apmaan nahin balki germany kaa apmaan tha
 7
 Treacherous Treaty: The Treaty of Warsaw was considered morally unfair and treacherous to Germany
 germany ne wilson ke 14 sutron ke aadhaar par yuddh kar sandhi karnaa sweekaar kiya tha lekin varsay kii sandhi main wilson ke in sutron kaa khuleam ulanghan hua tha
 The principle of nationalism was not followed with Germany
 us par bahut si sharte lad di gai thi
 But the winners are exempt from that
 wilson ke tisare sutara ke anusaar anterrashtriya vyapaar kii samast rukawate dur karne kaa praytn karnaa tha, kintu germany kii samuhik swtantraa surakshit nahin thi
 His international trade remained under the control of the Allies for years
 14 sutron main sabhi rashtron ke shastron ke kami karne kaa suzav diya gaya tha, kintu mitra rashtron ne apane shastron main kami kiye bina germany kii sainik shakti ko atyant simit kar diya
 The Allies followed Wilson's 14 sources to the same extent as he benefited
 is tarah varsay kii sandhi main germany ke saath vishwasghaat kiya gaya
 To further avenge this betrayal, Germany went to war
 8
 sandhi ke pranetaon main vaicharik sangharsh : varsay kii sandhi ne teen bado ke vichaara or uddeshyon main sangharsh kii sthiti maujuud thi
 There was opposition between Wilson's high but impractical view, between Climenso's nationalist and realist demands, and Lloyd George's opportunistic motives, despite their agreement on the Treaty of Warsaw that reflected their imperialist and exploitative mentality
 logsan ke anusaar “wilson ke adarshavaad or sammelan ke bhautikwaad main teevr virodh tha or zyaadaatar maamalon main bhautikwaad vijayi rahaa
 " 9
 sanghash ke naye daur kii shuruuaat : varsay kii sandhi ne europea rashtron ke bich vishwavyapa satta ke liye nae sangharsh kii shuruuaat kii
 Until 1919, international law believed in the distinction between the property of a country's government and its citizens
 kintu varsay kii sandhi ke anusaar yuddhrat desh apane tathaa apane mitra rashtron kii seemaa main kisi shatru desh ke vyakti kii kisi prakaar kii sampati jabt kar saktaa tha
 If he was victorious in the war, he could force the government of the defeated country to compensate for its citizens' confiscated property
 yah ek nayaa drushtaant tha
 10
 Hatred towards the Weimar Republic: After the war, the Weimar Republic was established in Germany and was seen to be associated with the Treaty of Warsaw
 tamaam udaaravaadi visheshtaon ke bich ise shatru paksh dwaara sthapit sanstha mana gaya
 Therefore, in Germany, democracy became a system of dualism, hateful and hostile
 11
 aatmanirnay ke siddhant kii avhelnaa : italy kii simaaen rashtrawaad ke siddhant par nirdhaarit nahin kii gai, na hi poland kii bhoomi par sabhi naagarik nirvivaadit rup se pole the
 Similarly, parts of the Turkish Empire were not promised sovereignty
 rashtrasang vishaal va laghu rajyon ke samaan raajnneetik samprabhutaa dilaane main asamarth rahaa
 Regarding the moral aspect and tactical compatibility of this treaty, AJP Taylor states that "from the beginning the Treaty of Warsaw lacked moral recognition
" germany ke vishay main aatm nirnay ke siddhant kii avhelnaa kii gai
 Many nations of Europe were reorganized according to President Wilson's principle of self-determination
 isse anusaar ek hi raashtra jati, ek hi bhashaa evam saanskrithik parampara vaale logon ko milakar unka pruthak tantra banane kaa nishchay kiya gaya
 On this basis, independent states of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia were born
 kintu is siddhant kaa germany, austria or hungary ke sambandh main paalan nahin kiya gaya
 Thousands of German citizens were separated from the German Empire and subjugated to other states
 ” 1918 i
 main jab austria ke germanon ne german-austria ganatantr kii sthapana kii or german ke ganatantr ke saath sammilit hone va land ko milaane kii ichha vyakt kii tab mitra rajyon dwaara sitambar 1919 i
 main donon rajyon ke sammilan par pratibandh laga diya gaya
 Thus the German citizens were disappointed by not implementing the principle accepted by the Allies about Germany
 butlerane anusaar “aatmanirnay ke siddhant kaa yuktiyukt prayog na karnaa paris kii vyavastha main antarnihit kamajori kaa dyotak tha
 " vishwa itihaas ke jin ek sandhiyon or uske prabhaavon kii sarvaadhik charchaa hui he, unamem varsay kii sandhi kaa vishisht sthaan he
 Critics have defined it as the cause of World War II in terms of the harsh provisions of that treaty and its form
 unke anusaar varsay kii sandhi shanti kii vyavastha na hokar asantosh kii janak thi
 Just after 20 years, 2 months and 4 days after the treaty, this world was hit by the Second World War
 sandhi hone ke baad se hi uski vyavasthaaon ko germany dwaara bhang kiya jaataa rahaa
 At the same time amendments were also made to the treaty provisions
 in sandhi praavdhaanon ke ulalanghanon evam sanshodhano ne sansar ko dwitiya vishwa yuddh kii ore dhakel diya
 The treaty provisions were violated and amended because it was too harsh and abusive
 aisi kathor evam apmanjanak sandhi kii sharton ko koi bhi swabhimani raashtra ek lambey samay tak bardaasht nahin kar saktaa tha
 Therefore, it was clear that Germany would try to get rid of the system imposed by the Versailles Treaty and wash away the stigma of humiliation as soon as the above opportunities are given in future
 germany kii catholic centre party ke agerburger kaa viraam sandhi ke samay vaktavy tha ki "german jati ksht sahegi parantu maregi nahin
 "naturally, Germany made a successful attempt to wash away these derogatory terms
 parinamswaroop kuch hi varshon main europe kaa raajnneetik vaataavaran atyant ashaant ho gaya or vishwa ko pratham mahayuddh se bhi adhik bhayankar or pralayankari yuddh dekhnaa padaa
 Even according to France's Marshal Fouche "this treaty is not peace, only a 20-year ceasefire
" " spasht he ki isi sandhi main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke beej vidyaman the
 At the time of the treaty in 1919, Germany was helpless and had no choice but to quietly accept the treaty but as time passed, it began to breach the terms of the treaty by accumulating some power and the treaty makers also Made amendments
 1926 main jab germany ko rashtrasang kii sadsyta di gai tab sandhi ke pratham bhaag main sanshodhan kiya gaya
 The seventh part of the war criminals was never fully implemented
 german samraat wiliam kaisar sahit anek yuddh aparaadhiyon ko dand na dekar mahaj kuch ek ko saamaanya dand die gaye
 The provision relating to compensation was first amended and later abandoned altogether
 lojaan sammelan main kshatipurti ke prashn ko hi samaapt kar diya gaya
 After Hitler's rise to German politics in 1933–34, breaking the terms of Warsaw became a minor thing
 1935-36 main hitler ne sandhi ke nihshastreekaran se sambandhit praavdhaanon kaa ulanghan kar senaaon main vruddhi kii or 1936 main rinland par adhikaar kar liya
 In March 1938, Hitler dissolved the provisions of the territorial arrangements of the Treaty of Warsaw by combining Austria with Germany and September 1938 in Czechoslovakia
 jab hitler ne varsay sandhi dwaara nirmit poland se sambandhit polish galiyare evam danging bandargah sambandhi vyavasthaaon ko todane ke uddeshy se poland par akraman kiya to dwitiya vishwayuddh prarambh ho gaya
 To break the unjust arrangements of the Versailles Treaty, Hitler started a series of events that led to the outbreak of the Second World War
 is tarah varsay kii sandhi praavdhaanon ke unmoolan kii prakriya kii antim parinti dwitiya vishwayuddh ke aarambh main hui
 From this point of view, the seeds of World War II can be seen in the Treaty of Versailles
 kuch aalochak maanate hai ki varsay sandhi kii kathor sharte nahin balki unako kriyanvit karne kii dhilaai dwitiya vishwayuddh kaa kaaran bani
 According to logsm is prakaar isamen koi andeh nahin ki varsay kii anyaaypurna kathor or apmanjanak sandhi, ek seemaa tak dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke liye uttaradaayi thi
 But it is also true that the conflicting policy of the Allies, neglect, indifference, appeasement and the policy of not strictly enforcing the terms of the treaty were also no less responsible for it

0214 sarnath, kaashi athwa varanasi ke 10 kilometre purvottar main sthit pramukh buddha tirthasthal he
 After attaining enlightenment, Lord Buddha gave his first sermon here, which is called "dharma Chakra Pravartan" and was the beginning of the propagation of Buddhism
 yah sthaan buddha dharm ke chaar pramukh tirthon main se ek he 
 Along with this, Sarnath also has importance in Jainism and Hinduism
 jain granthon main ise 'singhpur' kaha gaya he or mana jaataa he ki jain dharm ke gyarahawein tirthankar shreyansnath kaa janm yahan se thodi dur par hua tha
 There is also a temple of Saranganath Mahadev where a Hindu fair is held in the month of Sawan
 sarnath main ashok kaa chaturmukh sinhastambh, bhagwaan buddha kaa mandir, dhamekh stupa, chaukhandi stupa, rajkeey sangrahalay, jain mandir, chini mandir, mulangadhakuti or naveen vihaar ityadi darshneey hai
 The national symbol of India is the two-dimensional replica of the crown of the Ashoka Pillar here
 mohammad gori ne sarnath ke puja sthalon ko nasht kar diya tha
 In 1905, the Department of Archeology started excavation work here
 usee samay buddha dharm ke anuyaayon or itihaas ke vidwaanon kaa dhyaan idhar gaya
 Presently Sarnath is poised to grow steadily as a pilgrimage and tourist destination
 pehle yahan ghanaa van tha or mrug-vihaar kiya karte the
 At that time its name was 'rishipattan' and 'mrigaday'
 gyaan praapt karne ke baad gautam buddha ne apana pratham upadesh yaheen par diya tha
 During the time of Emperor Ashoka, many construction works were done here
 singhon kii murti vaala bharat kaa rajchihn sarnath ke ashok ke stambh ke sheersh se hi liya gaya he
 The 'dhamek Stupa' of this place still makes sense of the ancientness of Sarnath
 videshi akramanon or paraspar kii dharmik kheenchaatani ke kaaran aage chalakar sarnath kaa mahatv kam ho gaya tha
 The idol of Saranganath Mahadev was established in the deity and the place was named Sarnath
 iskaa pracheen naam rishipatan tha
 Rishipatan refers to the 'downfall of a sage' which means the place where one Buddha attained nirvana knowing Gautama Buddha's future enlightenment
 mrigon ke vicharan karne vaale sthaan ke aadhaar par iskaa naam mrigadaav padaa, jiskaa varnan nigrodhmrug jataka main bhi aayaa he
 The modern name 'sarnath' originated from 'saranganath' meaning Gautama Buddha
 jiskaa sambandh bodhisattva kii ek katha se bhi joda jaataa he
 The Bodhisattva saved the life of a pregnant deer by sacrificing his life in one of his former births, when he was the king of deer in Mrigadava
 isi kaaran is van ko saarang -nath yaa saar-nath kehane lage
 According to Dayaram Sahni, Shiva has also been called Saranganath in mythological literature and due to the proximity of Mahadev Shiva's city of Kashi, this place also became the site of Shivopasana
 is tathy kii pushti sarnath main, sarnath naamak shivmandir kii vartmaanta se hoti he
 The history of Sarnath dating back 300 years from the first sermon of the Buddha is unknown: as no remains of this period have been found from excavation
 sarnath kii samruddhi or buddha dharm kaa vikaas sarvapratham ashok ke shasankaal main drushtigat hota he
 He built Dharmarajika Stupa, Dhemakh Stupa and Singh Pillar at Sarnath
 ashok ke uttaradhikariyon ke shashan-kaal main pun: sarnath avnati kii ore agrasar hone laga
 BC The Sunga kingdom was established in the second century, but no article of this period was found from Sarnath

 ke lagbhag uttar bharat ke kushaan rajya kii sthapana ke saath hi ek baar pun: buddha dharm kii unnati hui
 In the third year of Kanishka's reign, the monk force established a Bodhisattva statue here
 kanishka ne apane shashan-kaal main na keval sarnath main varan bharat ke vibhinn bhaagon main bahut-se viharon evam stupon kaa nirmaan karavaaya
 According to a local legend, Sarnath was the center of Shivopasana before the propagation of Buddhism
 kintu, jaise gaya aadi or bhi kai sthanon ke itihaas se pramanit hota he baat isaki ulti bhi ho sakati he, arthath buddha dharm ke patan ke pashchaat hi shiv kii upasna yahan prachlit hui ho
 It seems that just as many ancient large cities had suburbs or nagarodyan, similarly in Sarnath there were originally ashrams of sages or ascetics which they built to escape the clamor of Kashi, but still to live in the vicinity of the great city

 He described Sarnath as very happy

 a vihara was built by Sarnath of Rani Kumar Devi of Govind Chandra during the reign of Gahadwal Vash
 utkhanan se praapt ek abhilekh se bhi isaki pushti hoti he
 After this, the glory of Sarnath came to an end
 sarnath ke sandarbh ke aitihaasik jaankaree puraatatvavidon ko us samay hui jab kashinaresh chet singh ke dewan jagat singh ne dharmarajika stupa ko agyaanavash khudva daalaa
 The incident attracted public attention towards Sarnath

 The material obtained from this excavation is now safe in the Indian Museum of Calcutta
 kaikenji ke utkhanan ke 20 varsh pashchaat 1835-36 main kaningham ne sarnath kaa vistrut utkhanan karavaaya
 In excavation, they excavated mainly Dhemakh Stupa, Chaukhandi Stupa and Medieval Viharas
 kaningham kaa dhamekh stupa se 3 foot neeche 600 i

 Apart from this, a large number of stone pieces and sculptures used in buildings were also found here, which are now safe in the Indian Museum of Calcutta

 Apart from the main temple and the Ashoka pillar, a large number of sculptures and inscriptions have been found here

 John Marshall, director general of the Department of Archeology, along with his colleagues Stancono and Dayaram Sahni, excavated the north-south areas of Sarnath in 1907
 utkhanan se uttar kshetra main teen kushaankalin mathon kaa pataa chalaa
 From the south area, especially around Dharmarajika Stupa and north of Dhamekh Stupa, they found the remains of many small stupas and temples
 inamen se kumaradevi ke abhilekhon se yukt kuch murtiyan vishesh mahatva kii hai
 This excavation work continued in later years as well

 The entire area from Dhamekh Stupa to the main temple was excavated
 is utkhanan se dayaram saahani ko ek 1 foot 9 1⁄2 inch lambii, 2 foot 7 inch chaudee tathaa 3 foot gahari ek naalee ke avshesh mili
 The following monuments have come to light from the above excavations- dhamekh stupa se aadha mile dakshin yah stupa sthit he, jo sarnath ke avshisht smarakon se alag hai
 It was at this place that Gautama Buddha preached the first sermon to his five disciples, which led to the construction of this stupa as a memorial
 huentsaang ne is stupa kii sthiti sarnath se 0
8 kimi dakshin-pashchim main bataai he, jo 91

 unchaa tha
 Its identity seems to be right from the Chaukhandi stupa
 is stupa ke upar ek ashtaparshviya burji bani hui he
 The stone lying on its northern door mentions an article in Persian, which suggests that it was built in 1589 AD by Govardhan, son of Todarmal
 lekh main varnit he ki humayun ne is sthaan par ek raat vyateet kii thi, jisaki yaadgaar main is burj kaa nirmaan sambhav hua
 Alexander Cunningham excavated the central part of it in 1836 AD in search of tombstones placed in this stupa, with no significant object found from this excavation

 In the excavation, they found some statues, a stucco at the outpost and four yards high

 The name 'chaukhandi' of this stupa seems old
 iske aakaar-prakaar se gyaat hota he ki ek chaukor kursi par thos eenton kii kramash: ghatati hui teen manzile banaai gai thim
 On the top of the floor there was probably a statue installed on the open roof
 guptkaal main is prakaar ke stupon ko ‘trimedhi stupa’ kehete the
 Based on the materials obtained from the excavation, it is certain that this stupa was built during the Gupta period

 The second addition occurred in the fifth or sixth century after the invasion of the Huns

 The carved spheres and concave castings, small pillars and beautiful artistic erosions built on this temple make it certain that it was built during the Gupta period
 parantu iske chaaron ore mitti or chooney kii bani hui pakki farshon tathaa deevaaro ke bahari bhaag main prayukt ast-vyast naqkashidaar pattharon ke aadhaar par kuch viddhanon ne ise 8veen shatabdi ke lagbhag kaa mana he
 It appears that under the mandapa built in the middle of this temple, initially a gold shining man-made statue of Lord Buddha was installed
 mandir main pravesh ke liye teenon dishaao main ek-ek dwaar or purv disha main mukhya pravesh dwaar tha
 Later, when the roof of the temple began to weaken, the inner Dakshinapath was closed by lifting the walls to protect it
 at: aane jane kaa rasta keval purv ke mukhya dwaar se hi rah gaya
 With the closing of the three doors, it became like a cell, which was later given the shape of small temples

 main shri oretal ko khudaai karaate samay dakshin vaali kothri main ekashmak pathar se nirmit 9 1⁄2 x 9 1⁄2 foot kii mauryalin vedika mili
 This Vedika has a bright polishing of that time
 yah vedika prarambh main dharmarajika stupa ke upar hearnika ke chaaron ore lagi thim
 On this Vedika, two articles are written in the Kushanian Brahmi script - 'achayanaan Sarvastivadi na Parigrahetavam' and 'acharyana Sarvastivadinam Parigrahe'
 in donon lekhon se yah gyaat hota he ki teesri shatabdi i

 On the west side from the main temple there is an Ashokal stone pillar whose height was initially 17

 was

 The upper end of the pillar is now in the Sarnath Museum
 neenv main khudaai karte samay yah pataa chalaa ki isaki sthapana 8 foot X16 foot X18 inch aakaar ke bade pathar ke chabutare par hui thi
 Three articles are mentioned on this column

 The second article is from the Kushan period

 Its cover is very beautiful and attractive from the point of view of art
 alankaranon main mukhya rup se swastik, nandyavart sadrush vividh akritiyaan or phool-pattee ke kataav kii belein hai
 The artisans of Gupta period were well versed in making such Vallari head ornaments
 is stupa kii neenv ashok ke samay main padi
 It was expanded in the Kushan period, but it was completely ready in the Gupta period
 yah sakshya pattharon kii sajaavat or un par gupt lipi main ankit chinhon se nishchit hota he
 Cunningham first excavated the middle of this stupa and obtained a stone slab 0
91 meters below
 is shilapatt par saatvin shatabdi kii lipi main ‘ye dharmahetu prabhava’ manch ankit tha
 The bricks used in this stupa are 14 1⁄2 inch x 8 1⁄2 inch x 2 1⁄4 inch
 dhamek shabd kii utpatti ke bare main vidwaanon kaa mat he ki yah sanskrit ke ‘dharmegna’ shabd se niklaa he
 But the word 'dhamak Jayatu' is found on an 11th-century currency
 jisase uski utpatti kaa upar likhe shabd se sambandhit hona sandehaaspad lagata he
 In this posture, this stupa is called a blast
 ise log badi aadar kii drushti se dekhte the or isaki puja karte the
 Cunningham has accepted the word 'dhemakh' as an abbreviation for the Sanskrit word 'sermon'
 ullekhneey he ki buddha ne sarvapratham yahan ‘dharmachakr’ prarambh kiya tha
 Therefore, it is possible that due to this reason its name is Dhamekh
 sarnath ke kshetra kii khudaai se guptakaleen anek kalakritiyaan tathaa buddha pratimaayein praapt hui hai jo vartmaan sangrahalay main surakshit hai
 a different style of sculpture of Sarnath was prevalent during the Gupta period, which is famous in the history of Indian sculpture for its blended spirituality and physical beauty of Buddha statues
 sarnath main ek pracheen shiv mandir tathaa ek jain mandir bhi sthit hai
 The Jain temple was built in 1824 AD; There is a statue of Shriyanshdev in it
 jain kinvadanti he ki ye tirthankar sarnath se lagbhag do mile dur sthit singh naamak gram main tirthankar bhav ko praapt hue the
 a number of important inscriptions have also been found from Sarnath, including the inscription of the prominent Kashiraja Pravaditya
 isamen baladitya naresh kaa ullekh he jo flit ke mat main vahi baladitya he jo mihirkul hun ke saath veertapurvak ladaa tha
 This inscription is probably before the 7th century
 duusare abhilekh main harigupt naamak ek sadhu dwaara murtidan kaa ullekh he
 This inscription appears to date to the 8th century AD

 adikaal se hi yuddh kii parampara chali aa rahi he
 The history of mankind is incomplete without the study of war and the history of war is as old as the story of mankind
 yuddh maanav sabhyataa ke vikaas ke pramukh kaarnon main se ek hai
 The rise and destruction of many civilizations took place, but the war never ended
 jaise-jaise sabhyataa kaa vikaas hua vaise-vaise naveen hathiyaaron ke nirmaan ke falswaroop yuddh ke swaroop main parivartan avashya aayaa he
 Military science, as the name suggests, is made up of the words 'army' and 'science'
 sena ek aisa susangathit dal he jiskaa kaary ladaai karnaa he or vigyaan se abhipraay kisi gyaan ko is prakaar krambaddh kar liya jaataa he jisase ki uskaa vidhipurvak adhyayan kiya ja sake
 Thus, the name of a team formed by a state or a well organized society to fight is army and the order of knowledge related to that army is military science
 kisi bhi vishay ko paribhaasha ke parcote main baandhna aasaan nahin he
 Due to the vast field of military science and being interdisciplinary, no definite definition has been given
 phir bhi kuch manishiyon kii sainya vigyaan se sambandhit nimna paribhaasha he- Captain B

 According to Maliwal, "military science is that branch of knowledge in which military ideology, organization materials and skills are studied in a social context
 ’’ According to Prof
 Ram Avatar, "the subject of military science gives us the knowledge of the war-craft, ie, the tools of war and the war style and the impact it has on society and the war style of social changes
 ’’ Major R
C
 According to Kulshrestha, "military science is that branch of human knowledge which has been considered important for establishing social peace and protecting private sovereignty from external aggression since the early period, under it peacekeeping tools, army organization, The use and development of weapons, war styles are studied from a mental, social, economic and political point of view
 ’’ According to Prof
 M
P
 Samre, "military science is the science of strategy, economics and administration
 ’’ All the above definitions make us realize that military science is a social subject which gives us information about the causes, method and means of wars in society
 kisi bhi vishay ke kshetra kaa abhas uski paribhaasha se ho jaataa he
 All things related to war and military are studied in military science
 samay or yug ke parivartan ke saath-saath yuddh kii prakriyaaon main parivartan aata chalaa jaataa he, isi ke saath sainik sanghathan, uske prashikshan, shastrastron main bhi parivartan aata chalaa gaya, vaise hi sainya vigyaan ke kshetra main bhi parivartan aata gaya
 In modern times, scientific advances and inventions have expanded and broadened the field of war
 vigyaan se abhipraay kisi bhi vishay ke niyamanusaar adhyayan se he is drushti se sainya vigyaan vishay ko vigyaan kii kasuti main ksaa jaay to puri tarah se khara utarataa he, kyonki iske antargat sena ke sanghathan, shastrastra, yudhkala kutayojana, prabandh evam samartantra aadi kaa kramik adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Just as there are some principles and rules of science and if action is taken on the basis of them, then the objective is achieved according to that rule
 isi prakaar se sainya vigyaan ke antargat yuddh ke anek siddhanth hai jinke paalan karne se uddeshy kii prapti avashyambhavi hoti he
 Or science says those subjects whose truth can be tested in laboratories and the rules which are eternal and true and art are those subjects whose truth of rules cannot be tested with certainty
 vigyaan hamen kisi vastu ke vishay main gyaan detaa he or kala us kaary ko karnaa sikhaati he
 From this point of view knowledge about warfare, army, military organization, training, weapons, war moves etc
 is necessary, military science is science and military science is also art as far as military training and military exercises are concerned
 Makers of Modern Strategy main likhaa he ki yuddh kaa koi vigyaan nahin hota na hoga hi
 War is related to many types of sciences, but war has no science of its own
 yah to vyavhaarik kala or kaushal he
 In this context, the statement of famous military expert Clausewitz is remarkable
 donon hi pakshon ke aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki sainya vigyaan, vigyaan evam kala donon ke antargat aata he, parantu anubhav, adhyayan kii apekshaakrit adhik shaktishaalee paksh prathit hota he
 Being a branch of military science knowledge, it is natural and necessary to have a relationship with other branches
 bhugolic paristhitiyon kaa pratyaksh prabhaav sainik yojanaon, shastrastron, sankriyaaon, saaj-sajja evam samaratantrik chaalon par padataa he
 This is the reason that every nation has to adopt security system according to its geographical conditions
 is sandarbh main prasiddh british general vavel kaa kahana he ki- kisi sthaan kaa bhugol hi vahaan hone vaali ladaaiyon ke swaroop ko sunishchit karata he
 Ignoring geographical facts, no army can win a war
 itihaas se hamen maanav jati kii samskruti evam sabhyataa se sambandhit samast jaankaree milti he jiske abhaav main yudhon kaa adhyayan adhuraa hi he
 The analysis of victory and defeat of past wars is the basis of present and future wars
 yuddh ke devtaa ke naam se vikhyath prasiddh senapati nepolian bonapart kaa kathan he ki- mahaan senanayakon ke abhiyaanon kaa baar-baar adhyayan evam manan karo, unhen apana adarsh banaao
 This is the secret of knowing the differences of martial arts and becoming a great general
 dhan ke bina sainya sanghathan sambhav nahin he
 Economically, it is also difficult for a strong nation to develop its military because the number of the army and the type of armed forces, the appropriate military plan, etc
 are completely based on the economic sources of the particular nation
 karl marks ke anusaar, ‘‘kisi yug ke sampoorn saamaajik jivan ke swaroop kaa nishchay aarthik paristhitiyaan hi karti he
 Modern warfare is very expensive and it is very difficult to supply the strategic needs
 suntaju ne likhaa he yuddh rajya kaa ek aavashyak ang he ore shuman bhi kehete hai ki yuddh rajya shakti kaa antim hathiyaar he
 In this context, the famous German military expert Clausewitz's statement that the state resorts to war to implement its policies
 aaj yuddh kii prakruti badal gai he desh ke prayek naagarik ko pratyaksh athwa apratyaksh dhang se yuddh main yogadan karnaa hota he
 The army is a type of social organization in which mental elements such as discipline, morale, leadership, courage, fear, propaganda, patriotic spirit, concern, psychosis are very important
 aaj ke yuddh manovaigyanik yuddh hote he jisamen vaastavik ladaai ke pehle hi shatru ke yauddhik maansikta kaa vighatan karnaa hota he
 Hitler's statement shows the deep connection between military science and psychology that the actual battle is fought before a shot is fired
 is sambandh main kautilya ne kaha he ki, ‘‘ek dhanushadhari ke dhanush se choda hua baan sambhav he kisi ek bhi sainik ko na maare, parantu budhimaan vyakti ke dwaara kiya gaya buddhi kaa prayog garbh sthit praaniyon ko bhi nasht kar detaa he
 If science and technology have the greatest impact in any one area of life, then it is the military field
 maanav sabhyataa ke vikaas main pachaas pratishat se adhik khojon kaa uddeshy sainik aavashyaktaa rahi he
 Modern scientific and technological development is behind the concept of non-conventional and total war
 aanvik shastrastron evam prakshepastron ke sanhaarak kshamta ke sandarbh main prasiddh vaigyanik oinstin ne likhaa he ki, ‘‘main nahin jaanata ki tritiy vishwayuddh main kin-kin hathiyaaron kaa istemaal hoga? kintu main nishchit rup se yah bataa saktaa hum ki chaturth vishwa yuddh main kin hathiyaar kaa istemaal hoga, arthath pathar
 This statement reflects the crisis created by human use of modern technology
 yuddh main safalataa praapt karne ke liye vifaille rasayanon kaa prayog pracheen kaal se hi hota aa rahaa he
 The Atharvaveda, Markandeya Purana, Vishnudharmottara Purana, Shukraniti Shastra, Panchatantra, Kautilya Arthashastra, Manusmriti and Vrihata Samhita etc
 texts mention many types of weapons by which to make fire in the battlefield, pouring rain, thunder of clouds, from all around
 Creating darkness etc
 was done
 aadhunik yuddh main dhuna failaane vaali, dam ghotane vaali, ankhon main jalan paidaa karne vaali, twachaa ko jalaane vaali jaise kai prakaar ke vifaille rasayanon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Due to which chemical warfare is born
 jaivik karkon ke dwaara shatru ke bhojan, pani evam khaadya saamagree ko vishakt karke uske swasthya ko kamjor kar uske yuddh karne kii maansik shakti kaa vighatan karne kii har sambhav koshish kii jaati he
 Bacteria of various types of diseases are transmitted to the enemy by various means
 vifaille jeevanuon se utpann rog se keval sainik hi prabhavit nahin hote apitu nagarikon par bhi iskaa baraabar asar hone ke kaaran shatru kaa manobal gir jaataa he jisase uski sainik samarthy par vipareet prabhaav padataa he
 Apart from the subjects mentioned above, military science has a deep relation with other subjects like computer science, social science etc
 pracheen yuddh simit hote the jinka sambandh keval senaaon evam senapatiyon tak hota tha, aam janata kii yudhon ke prati koi vishesh ruchi nahin hoti thi
 As the civilization developed, the forms of wars also changed and today war has assumed the shape of complete war
 aadhunik yuddh sampoorn raashtra kii pariksha he
 The utility of the subject of military science can be outlined as follows- sainya vigyaan vishay ko suraksha adhyayan, raksha evam suraksha adhyayan, raksha evam straatejic adhyayan, suraksha evam yuddh adhyayan naam se bhi adhyayan-adhyaapan kiya jaataa he
 Significantly, defense studies, called Defense Studies, War Studies, Military Science and Strategic Studies, are conducted in India
 is vishay ke mahatv kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki duniya ke kai pramukh deshon main dephence studies kii padhai skool, college or vishvavidhyalay staron par hoti he
 After doing a related course, all the options for the job are coming up
 dephence va stratsic studies ko military / dephence studies, military science, war and neshnal security studies, war and stratsic studies ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Seeing its importance, former Prime Minister Dr
 Manmohan Singh laid the foundation stone of Indian National Defense University at Binola, Gurgaon, Haryana on 23 May 2013
 prastaavit bhartiya rashtriya raksha vishvidhyalay 200 acre se adhik bhoomi par sthit hoga
 It will start functioning fully in 2018
 naksalwad, aatankwaad, ugravad, bhashavad, sampradayikta, pradeshikta, jan-jatiy vidroh jaise samasyaon kaa hal sainik madhyam se nahin nikaala ja saktaa na hi isse ye sabhi samasyayen samaapt hone vaali hai or na hi shaanti evam suraksha kii sthapana kii ja sakati he
 For this, it is necessary to create an atmosphere of trust
 uparyukt samasyaon kii tah tak jaakar mul kaarnon ke taarkik evam vyavhaarik upaay dhundne se hoga
 Military science elaborates on the causes, effects and remedies of internal and external security problems
 jiske vartmaan sandarbh main adhyayan kii nitant aavashyaktaa he
 The famous military thinker Lydil Hart has said that - if you want peace, understand war
 vishwa main yuddh ke rokthaam ke liye sabase aavashyak he yuddh ke kaaran, prabhaav evam parinaam par gahan chintan, manan evam charchaa karne kii
 Study of this subject also provides active support in preventing world destruction
 aaj vishwa ke paas itane ghaatak evam vinaashak hathiyaar hai ki samast prithvi ko hajaaro baar nasht kiya ja saktaa he
 Modern warfare is a total war and in which non-conventional war style weapons can be used and the center of war can be both military and civilian bases
 rankshetra main morcha samhaal rahe sainikon ke liye sambhav nahin ki itani badi aabaadi kii har jagah madad kii ja sake
 Therefore, detailed information about the measures of civil defense can be obtained through military science
 kisi bhi rajya ke liye yuddh kii vittiya aavashyaktaaon kii purti karnaa behad kathin kaary he
 Therefore, during the wartime, the government takes assistance like donations, donations and loans from the public
 sainya vigyaan yuddh par sampoorn prakaash daalata he evam vidhyaarthee ko isaki gahari samaj pradaan kar jimmedaar naagarik bana saktaa hai
 What are our duties towards the country through military science and how should we protect the motherland by staying in the society and get an opportunity to present ourselves as an ideal soldier
 aaj kaa vidhyaarthee kal kaa jimmedaar naagarik athwa sainik banakar suraksha hit ke muddon ko gaharaai se samaj saktaa he
 There are a lot of career prospects in this field
 yah aapako ek desh se duusare desh ke saath vaishvik maamle sambandh aadi kii jaankaree detaa he
 After taking a course in this field, you can become a socio-economic specialist, a researcher in the international field
 iske saath hi aap indian navy, air force, dephence jarnalism main indian army officer, indian dephence officer, ground duty officer, research officer, military officer ban sakate hai
 Candidates pursuing Bachelors or Masters degrees in Defense and Strategic Studies can work as Lecturers, College Professors, University Professors or do research in International Relations, Geopolitical Affairs of War, Geopolitical Affairs, socio-economic and Strategic Areas
 Huh
 iske alaava rojgaar ke avasar mukhya taur par bhartiya sena, vaayu sena, nausena, ajukeshan korporations, dephence jarnalism main maujuud hai
 If you have obtained a master's degree in this field, then you can write articles about national security in newspapers, magazines etc
 yuddh sanchaalan kii paddati or prakriya ab raajnneetigyon kaa mukhya vishay ban gaya he, kyonki sabase bade astr arthath aanvik hathiyaaron kaa niyantran evam prayog raajnneetigyon ke haath main he na ki senanayakon ke
 a student of military science can show a skilled leadership ability by having sufficient knowledge in military matters beforehand
 kyonki aaj ki sabase badi vidmbana raajnneetigyon kaa sainya gyaan kii samaj kaa abhaav he

 In the seventh Anuvak of Brahmanandavalli, the origin of Jagat has been described from Assat, but 'asat' is the technical term of this Upanishad which is not a sign of unvarnished Brahmo rather than absence, and has given the name of Jagatta as Satta and has given it a distorted form of Brahma

 Amnesia is a deficit in memory due to brain damage, illness, or psychological trauma
 vibhinn sedatives or hypnotic dawaaon ke upyog se amnesia asthaayee rup se bhi kaaran ho saktaa he
 Memory may be completely or partially lost due to the extent of damage that occurs
 do mukhya prakaar ke amnesia hai: retrogred amenesia or antrogred amenesia
 Retrograde amnesia is the inability to retrieve information acquired prior to a particular date, usually the date of the accident or operation
 kuch maamalon main smriti haani dashakon tak bad sakati he, jabaki anya main vyakti keval kuch maheenon kii smriti kho saktaa he
 Anterograde amnesia is the inability to transfer new information from the short-term store to the long-term store
 is prakaar ke amliya vaale log lambey samay tak chizon ko yaad nahin kar sakate hai
 These two types are not mutually exclusive; Both can occur simultaneously
 cese studies yah bhi dikhaate hai ki aam taur par minesia madhyakaalin loukik lob ko nuksaan pahunchaata he
 In addition, specific regions of the hippocampus are involved with memory
 shodh se yah bhi pataa chalaa he ki jab dianesaflone ke kshetron ko kshatigrast kar diya jaataa he, to bhulbhulaiya ho sakati he
 Recent studies have shown a correlation between rbap48 protein and memory loss deficiency

 In people suffering from amnesia, the ability to recall immediate information is still intact, and they may still be able to create new memories

 Patients can learn new procedural knowledge
 iske alaava, priming taaja gaiyr-ghoshnaatmak gyaan ke seekhney main emirate kii sahaayta kar sakate hai
 Amnesic patients also retain intellectual, linguistic, and social skills despite profound impairments in the ability to recall specific information encountered in prior learning episodes

 Acquisition of new memories amliya ke saath mariz nai jaankaree, vishesh rup se gaiyr-ghoshnaatmak gyaan sikh sakate hai
 However, some patients with dense anterograde amnesia do not remember episodes during which they first learned or saw the information
 ghoshnaatmak jaankaree Some patients with anterograde amnesia may still receive some semantic information, even though it may be more difficult and perhaps unrelated to more common sense

 The reason patients cannot form new episodic memories is because the CA1 region of the hippocampus was lesion, and thus could not make a connection to the hippocampus cortex
 shalya chikitsa ke baad ek ischimik episod ke baad, rogi arabi ke ek emarai ne sietch 1 pyramid koshikaon tak simit ek vishisht ghaav ko chhodkar apane hippocampus ko barkaraar rakhaa

 For example, some patients show improvement in pseudorandom sequence experimentation as healthy people
 isliye, prakriyaatmak shiksha ghoshnaatmak smriti ke liye aavashyak mastishk pranali se swatantra rup se aage bad sakati he
 According to fmri studies, the acquisition of procedural memories activates the basal ganglia, premotor cortex, and the complement motor region, regions that are not typically associated with the formation of declarative memories
