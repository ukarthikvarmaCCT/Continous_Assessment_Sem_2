 People undergo plastic surgery in the hope that after the operation they will look slightly different and look better than before
 lekin dakshin korea ke kuch plastic sarjan to apane kaam main itane maahir hai ki unke marij alag hi tarah kii dikkaton kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 Yes, some patients who come to South Korea from abroad to have a plastic surgery are changed so much that it becomes very difficult for them to return home
 oparation ke baad unki shakl unke passport par lagi photi se milti hi nahin
 According to Korean websites Onboa and Munhua, some hospitals are also giving patients 'plastic surgery certificates' so that they can easily return to their homes
 is certificate main marij kaa passport number, jahaan ilaaj kiya gaya us aspataal kaa naam or dakshin korea main unke rukne kii avadhi kaa vivaran hota he
 It is believed that giving the certificate reduces the problems of the patients
 haalanki aspataal pichley kai saalon se is pareshaani ke bare main jaanate the, lekin ab yah ek aam mudda ban gaya he
 It is said that in 2009, 23 Chinese women found it difficult to return to their country after undergoing plastic surgery in South Korea
 in mahilaon ko airport par passport adhikariyon ne roak liya tha kyonki unki aakhen badi, naak oonchi or patali thudi thi, jabaki passport par lagi photo main unki ankhen choti, naak chapati or thudi bhi moti thi
 The women were intensively investigated and then allowed to go to China
 lekin iske saath hi unhen hidaayat di gai ki ve jald se jald apana passport rineau kara len
 According to a passport officer, 'when we removed her hat and big glasses at our behest, we saw that she looked very different
 unke chehre par jagah-jagah bandes or taanken lage the
 He had to compare the part of his face to the photo on the passport, which he had not undergone

 agar koi yah sochataa he ki pulavama ke baad bharat koi jawaab nahin degaa to yah uski galati he
 After Pulwama, there has been a message from Air Strike that it is not a government from 2009 to 2014
 ho saktaa he ki paristhitiyaan pakistan ke niyantran main na hon lekin kam se kam ghatana ke baad vahaan ke piem ko isaki aalochana to kerani chahie thi iske liye unhen kisne roka tha
 These things were told by BJP President Amit Shah in India Today Conclave somewhere
 pakistan ke piem imran kehete hai ki pulavama kaa saboot dijie
 Imran says give evidence, on this Amit Shah said what to do about the evidence
 aap ninda to kariye
 Not even once did you condemn
 kam se kam ek baar to aap kehete ki jo hua vah galat hua
 People of Pakistan and PM should ask why AAP did not condemn
 shah se jab rahul kanwal ne poocha ki kya aap paak piem ko sena or aatankwaadiyon kii kathputli maanate hai
 Amit Shah said that he could not use this word
 ho saktaa he ki sthitiyaan pakistan ke niyantran main nahin hon lekin pulavama ghatana kii ninda to kii ja sakati thim
 It is not necessary to tell anyone and the people of India know that terrorism has its roots in Pakistan
 amit shah ne kaha ki ham sakht hai or kisi bhi hamale kaa jawaab dene main sakasham hai
 Pakistan has been isolated after Pulwama
 ham kam se kam samay main apane payalat abhinandan ko waapas laane main safal rahe hai
 He said that after the surgical strike after Uri and after the air strike after Pulwama, now Pakistan has to decide what to do now but if we are attacked, we will answer them
 shah ne aage kaha ki vipaksh ko is par sawaal poochne kaa haq nahin he
 He also said that Rahul Kanwal has the right to ask this question
 unhone kaha ki pakistan ke chehre par pehali baar unhone hansi dekhi jab 22 partiyon ke netaaon ne rijolushan paas kiya
 He said what the opposition wants
 unhone kaha ki sawaal to hamen poochna chahie ki 26-11 ke baad aapane kya kiya
 Rahul Kanwal, who was asking him a question, told that the then PM felt that nothing would happen with the air strike, while the Air Force had suggested this to him
 is par shah ne kaha ki baatcheet se kya hal niklaa
 We want to say directly that we will respond to every attack
 air strike ke baad ham yah sandesh dene main safal rahe hai ki ham chup rahane vaale nahin hai
 Manmohan Singh says that both countries should exercise restraint, how can both parties be weighed on one platform
 amit shah ne kaha ki sabase zyada aatanki narendra modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal main maare gaye hai or isi par sawaal uth rahe hai
 The country has been fighting terror for 30 years and it is not in the interest of the country not to respond to terror
 shah ne kaha ki kya vipaksh yah kahana chahta he ki pulavama hamane karaayaa
 We responded to the attack and will not respond if it does not improve
 kitaab:ham, tum or wo trek (change)lekhak:mo yaan, nobel vijetanuwaad:pushpesh pantapablisher:yatra buksacovar:paperbakakeemat:100 rupaap ek khubasurat si ladki ke kya bananaa chahenge
 Most of the time, they would say that their spouse lekin ek shaks he jo kahata he mujhe us sundar ladki kaa pita bananaa he
 The reason is even more interesting and that is a truck
 purana yuddh se lautaa dhuna phenkata, shor machaata trek
 And this begins the story of the short novel 'hum, Tum and Woh Truck' by Nobel Prize winner Mo Yan
 china ke ek gaanv, phir kasbe, shahar, haat or ab ek smart city sab kuch sametati he ye kahani
 Mo Yan's pen moves while writing a novel
 kathavachak ke taur par kahani main mo yaan puure vakt saath bolte hue se najar aate hai
 The story includes the narrator Mo Yan, along with Hee Jeebu, a master-sized Master Saab with different sizes, a beautiful attractive girl Lu Wenli, her father and an old truck gage-51
 skool se kai baar kahani ke ek tarah se mukhya kirdaar ko nikaala jaataa he lekin skool ke liye uske man main pyaar is kadar hota he ki wo skool kii taraf hi badhata dikhaai detaa
 Lu Wenli is a beautiful girl, on whom many children, including the master, from school to school, Jeevu, put their braids on
 lekin ye dore man main chhipe rahete hai he jivu ke bhi or
 
 
 
 !1969 se ghargharaata trek aage badhata he
 The characters move forward with their own stories
 sabake paas apni-apni jindagi kii kahani hoti he
 o Jeevu's marriage to Lou Wenley and his desire to become a father, driving a truck
 trek sabake man main thik us bade ghar kii tarah jagah bana letaa he, jaise aamtaur par aap ham bada sa sapanom kaa ghar kharidne kaa sapana sanjote hai, bilkul vaise hi
 As a new lover thinks of his Mehbooba, the characters of the story move forward in the story thinking, creating and forging the same thing about the truck
 yun to ham sab ek jab kabhi koi kahani sun yaa pard rahe hote hai, to wo ek lay main hoti he
 That means two after one, three after two
 lekin mo yaan ne is upanyaas main ek adbhut khel kiya he or wo ye he ki mo maan 1976 kaa kissa sunaate-sunaate achaanak saal 2009 par aa jaaenge
 Now, just after finishing a line, you come forward 33 years and start thinking according to 2009
 or tabhi mo ek baar phir aapako 1969 kii koi yaad potli se nikaalkar maujuun kisse main feet karte hue najar aaenge
 But believe me your mind will start clinging to the story instead of tearing it off in these years' trash trap
 kahani main mo yaan ek skool se nikaale jane vaale bachche se lekar pratiyogitaaon main bacchon ko entry dilaane yaa nikalwane kii haisiyat rakhane vaale safal lekhak kii ho jaati he
 And Lu Wenli, Gage-51 truck and Hey Jeevu all seem to be missing something different from the beginning of the story
 'ham, tum or wo trek' kii prastaavna main udai prakaash milan kundera ke intervyuu kaa zikr karte hue ek sateek si baat bataate hai,'itihaas apane mul main gambhir or traasad hone kaa bhram paidaa karata he, lekin bhavishya main vah har baar kisi comic main badal jaaya karata he'
 Even after reading this novel, you will be able to understand it better
 upanyaas main kuch jagah kuch dhansu se samvaad hai masalan, 'tumhaari haalat paakhaane se nikle use anpche ankur jaisi he, jise yah mugalata he ki vah pet se nikali khun chusane vaali jonk hai
 "good luck can mix lovers, accidents can happen all the time and bizarre and prodigies are always with us
" 'acchhee or buree baat:bura to yahi he ki aapkaa padhane kaa man nahin he or aap bahaanaa dhudh rahe hai, to chhodie baat hi khatm kiijie
 Don't read just because the author has received a Nobel
 rachi hui chhaviyaan hameshaa khatarnaak hoti hai
 Yes, if i become a bit of a Kuredi, this novel is not for those who expect an ending to be considered like a film at the end of a story
 sambhav he ki kahani kaa ant aapke palle na pade
 You can start thinking or reading the story of the book back and this is the good thing about the story
 ye koi clymex yaa ant aap par thopakar nahin jaati he
 Gives you the freedom to think self-consciously and find your ray of meaning in the end by blurring
 mo yaan ne change naam se yah laghu upanyaas chini bhashaa main likhaa tha, jiskaa kai bhashaaon main anuwaad kiya ja chukaa he
 Due to the fate of Hindi readers like Aap and Hum, this novel has become a little late
 anuwaad kahana thik nahin rahegaa
 JNU professor Pushpesh Pant has created something by drinking a slurry of black English words rather than spewing them into a Hindi translation
 or wo srijan itnaa bahaavdaar he ki aap jab us par savaar honge to jatke dene vaale trek kii kahani ke ird gird aap pushpesh kii bhashaa main behate chale jaaenge or aap dekhenge kuch der baad kitaab kaa aakhri panna aa gaya he
 And end the story
 bharat kii ore se islamabad ko saunpe gaye 50 ati vaanchit bhagodon kii suchi ko pakistan ke grih mantralay ne khaarij kar diya he
 According to the report of the news agency 'online', the Ministry of Home Affairs after reviewing the list has sent it to the Ministry of External Affairs for return to India
 report ke anusaar is suchi ko kuch dinon main pakistan main bhartiya ucchayukta ko saunp diya jayega

 yah film bhushan kumaar ke tii-siries or nikhil adwani ke amme antertenment ke binar tale ban rahi he
 The film is based on the actual incident of 19 September 2008, when the Indian Mujahideen (IM) was campaigned against at the Batla House in Delhi
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) In the results of the UP Legislative Assembly, where the BJP had got a bumper victory, the BSP had got a tough defeat
 basapa kaa supada saaf hone ke baad hi tamaam aalochak yah kehane lage the ki mayawati or basapa ab khatm ho gai hai
 But Mayawati then proves that they are not going to end so easily
 ve naakaami kii dhul jhaadkar phir uth khadi hui hai
 The BSP has won two seats of mayor in the civic elections and has given a tough fight to the BJP in many seats
 mahayor pad ke chunaav main beete varsh satta main rahi samaajawaadee party ke saath hi congress mukaable se baahar hai
 The civic election has silenced Nemayawati's critics
 in chunaavon ne sabit kiya he ki andolan se nikali party ko itani aasaani se khatm nahin kiya ja saktaa
 After the results of the UP elections, the media and many analysts started saying that Mayawati and BSP are now towards the end
 vidhansabha chunaav main basapa ko 19 siten mili thim
 bsp's rise: In Aligarh, the BSP has won over the mayor, where the BJP was in power for 22 years
 aligarh se meyar ke basapa pratyaashee mo
 Furkan defeated BJP candidate Rajiv Aggarwal by 11990 votes
 meerut nagar nikaay main bhi mahayor ke liye basapa kii sunita verma jeet chuki hai
 BSP candidates are in second or third place in many seats of the body elections and in many places BSP candidates have won good votes
 is khabar ko likhe jane tak nagar nigamon main basapa ke pratyaashee 146 parshad, 24 nagar palika adhyaksh, 222 nagar palika sadsy, 42 nagar panchayat adhyaksh, 201 nagar panchayat padon par jeet chuke hai
 The Grand Alliance will be discussed again, however, the way the BSP, Congress and SP got votes in the civic elections, once again this discussion can start that if the Grand Alliance of the three parties is formed then BJP can be easily defeated
 lekin basapa ne jis tarah se vaapasi kii he usase upi menmahagathbandhanaki sambhaavna dhoomil hi lag rahi he
 In very compulsion, it will be possible for sister Mayawati to have an alliance with the SP, but if they are emerging strong, this possibility may have to be watered down
 bangladesh main chal rahe tii-20 world cap main darshakon ko ek alag cheez dekhne ko mil rahi he
 Players are unable to take the stumps with them in the joy of winning matches during the tournament
 vajah, ye stamps kaaphi mahange hai
 Brontë Ackerman, who designed this particular stump, has patented it
 ve kisi ko stamps nahin dete
 However, he has said that if India wins the World Cup, they can give these stumps to Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 vaise bhi, team india ke captain ko jeet kii yaadgaar ke taur stump ghar laane kaa shauk he
 At the same time, Ackerman is strongly influenced by Dhoni
 shaayad, isliye unhone kaha ki dhoni kaa shauk puraa ho saktaa he, basharte ve world cap jitaayen
 The Australian company has made these stumps priced at 24 per stump
 18 lakh rupee he
 Each Gilli on top of them is worth about 45 thousand rupees, which is as expensive as the iphone
 inaki khaasiyat yah he ki gend jaise hi stamps se takaraati he, gilliyon par elidi lite chamakane lagati he
 The name of this technique is LED Jing
 kyon jalte hai ye stump?ye stamps mixd plastic se bane hai or isamen lage sensor ek micro procesar se jude hai
 Ackerman says he has to use patented technology worth $ 40,000 in every match
 yah keemat bahut adhik he
 Therefore, players cannot be allowed to carry stumps and gills at the end of the match
 aisa pehali baar nahin hua he jab elidi jing takanic kaa istemaal cricket main hua ho
 Such stumps have also been used in the Big Bash T20 League to be held in Australia
 chhattisgarh ke purv mukhyamantri ajit jogi ke vidhayak bete amit jogi kii jati ko lekar ghamaasan machaa he
 The matter has reached the High Court
 bijepi ke netaa nand kumaar saay va samira pakara ne ek yachika daayar kar amit jogi kii vidhayaki khatm karne kii maang kii he
 The notice issued by the court on this has reached the Bilaspur Collector and the Government
 iske baad se bilaspur colector ke daftar main khalabali much gayi he
 The reason is that the file containing caste certificate of Amit Jogi is neither in the collector's office nor in the office of the subdivisional officer from where this caste certificate was issued
 file kab gaayab hui or kisne haath maaraa ise lekar maathaa pachchi ho rahi he
 After Chhattisgarh's former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi was declared as non-tribal, now his son Amit Jogi is also being screwed
 amit jogi bilaspur jile kii marvaahee vidhansabha seat se vidhayak hai
 This seat is reserved for the tribal class
 aise main jab ajit jogi gaiyr adivasee qaraar de die gaye he to unke putr ko bhi adivasee nahin mana ja saktaa
 When the investigation started after the petition was filed in the Chhattisgarh High Court for revocation of the caste certificate of Marwahi MLA Amit Jogi and the termination of his legislature, then the information related to Marwahi MLA Amit Jogi's caste certificate was found missing from the Tehsil
 puure din karyaalay ke karmchaariyon ne khojbin kii par file kahin nahin mili
 At the same time, the top officers are trying to suppress this whole matter
 bilaspur colector ke mutabik amit jogi kii jati pramaan patr kii file khoji ja rahi he
 Since the case is very old, the file can be in the office somewhere
 ise khoj liya jayega
 Legal action will be taken soon in this regard
 amit jogi ne varsh 2013 main marvaahee vidhansabha kshetra se chunaav ladane ke liye oktober 2013 ko tehseeldaar ke court main asthai jati pramaan patr ke liye aavedan diya tha
 The Tehsildar issued a temporary certificate to Amit on the same day

 According to these reports, the incident occurred during a Sunday gathering in Cachoeira Paulista city in southeastern Brazil
 is sabha main padri Marcelo Rossi jo ki ek mashhoor dharmopadeshak hai, kareeb 50,000 logon kii bheed ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 Suddenly a woman came on stage and pushed them down
 padri ke upadesh kaa ek lanbaa video “portal UAI” ne 14 july, 2019 ko aplod kiya he, jisamen yah puraa ghatnakram dekha ja saktaa he
 The international fact check website "snopes" spoke to a local journalist and learned what he was saying just before the clergy were pushed
 padri ne jo kaha uskaa anuwaad hoga, “


yah haath ab mere haath nahin hai
 Sinful, weak, but these hands belong to Jesus, so much so that the pastor already serves as the man of Christ
 seva karne ke liye, aashirwad dene ke liye


”haalanki, yah spasht nahin he ki mahila ne padri ko manch se neeche kyon dhakela
 According to several media organizations such as the Portuguese website "O Dia", the 32-year-old woman was taken into custody by the police, but Pastor Marcelo Rossi denied any action against her and was released by the police
 in khabaron ke mutabik, jab yah ghatana ghati un dinon us mahila kaa maansik beemaari ko lekar ilaaj chal rahaa tha
 The reports also said that when the police asked why he pushed the pastor from the stage, he said that it was a case of "between them and me"
 is tarah yah saaf he ki mahila ne padri ko manch se neeche dhakela tha, lekin yah daawa galat he ki padri ne kaha tha ki moti auraten swarg nahin jaaengi
 For the last several days, a lot of preparations are being done in Delhi also regarding Chhath festival
 chhath ke liye ghaaton ko taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 But in Kalyanpuri, Delhi, there is a ghat near Kondli canal
 vahaan par kuch bhi vyavastha nazar nahin aayi
 The worst thing was that there is not even a slight cleanup here
 chaaron ore gandagi hi gandagi faili hui he
 In such a situation, when the water is released in the canal after 2 days, then how bad situation will be here
 is nahar main haryana kii hindon nadi se pani choda jaataa he
 How will people celebrate this holy festival in this filth? How will you bathe in this mess here? How will you worship six mothers here? Overall people are forced to celebrate this holy festival in this mess
 chhath samiti, kalyanpuri ke upaadhyaksh munesh raay ne bataaya, "yahan abhi tak sarkaar kaa koi adhikari nahin aayaa
 No one came to see what has been arranged here
 We have been upset by speaking up
 akhir kaise yahan mata kii puja hogi? hamaari samiti main kai log chanda bhi dete he or vahi chanda bhi ham istemaal karte hai
 Now if there is so much dirt here, how will we do pooja? Those people will kill us and say what have you arranged? How do we bathe in this mess? We do not know how the festival will be celebrated here
 "yani kul milakar ab kuch hi din bache he chhath parv ko shuru hone main aise main ab dekhnaa hoga kii kya dilli sarkaar parv ke pehle hi ghaaton ko vyavasthit kar paati he yaa nahin
 Has the bitter crisis once again deepened in the Aam Aadmi Party
 sutron ke mutabik, party ke chaar main se teen saansad in dinon naaraaz chal rahe hai
 Angry mps say that they are not being consulted in appointments to the Punjab organization, even though they are elected representatives of the party
 duusari ore, party bhi in saansadon se naaraaz bataai ja rahi he
 According to party sources, these three mps stay outside the area most of the time
 isse party janata ke bich main aalochana kaa kaaran ban rahi he
 Meanwhile, Harinder Singh Khalsa has written an email on July 6 to Daljeet Singh, chairman of the disciplinary committee in the party's Punjab unit, complaining about Sanjay Singh and Sucha Singh
 bataaya jaataa he ki is i-mail main donon par gambhir aarope lagaate hue likhaa gaya he ki donon ne milakar party kii aatma ko barbaad kiya he
 Not only this, Harinder Singh has written, while asking, is Kisanjay Singhkon, is he different from the party? Kejriwal asked for Baurais Mana Mutav
 The report has been summoned
 report main teen chizon kaa byoraa dene ko kaha gaya he- pehla ki saansadon ne ek saal main apane kshetra ke liye kya-kya kiya? doosraa ki party sanghathan ke liye saansadon ne kya-kya kiya? or teesraa yah ki loksabhaa main saansadon ne kya-kya kiya he?sutron ke mutabik, somvaar shaam naaraaz saansadon ne patiala main ek meeting bhi kii he
 According to the news, barring Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann, the rest of the three mps are going deep
 patiala ke saansad dharmaveer gandhi, faridakot ke saansad sadhu singh or fatehgarh sahib ke saansad harinder singh khalsa naaraaz bataae ja rahe hai
 a few days ago MP Harinder Singh also spoke to Kejriwal
 gauratlab he ki loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main aam aadmi party ko sirf punjab se hi siten mil pai thim or 2017 kii shuruyaat main vahaan vidhansabha chunaav bhi hone hai
 In such a situation, the party is engaged in the task of establishing its organization at the grassroots level
 gendbaaji line-ap main aswin ko na dekh windies khemaa khush hua hogaster of spinner aswin windies ke khilaaf shandaar record rakhte hangruuvaar ko antiga test shuru hone se kuch hi der pehle is khabar kii pushti kii gai ki ravichandran aswin nahin, balki rabindra jadeja test ke liye bharat ke ekmaatr spinner honge
 Meaning it is clear that Jadeja 'grabbed' Ashwin's place
 toss ke baad captain viraat kohli ne kaha,' ham unheen khilaadiyon ke saath utar rahe hai, jo isse pehle australia main bharat ke antim ekadash main the
 Ashwin, Saha, Kuldeep, Rohit and Umesh are not playing
 'ise ek 'ajeeb' faisla mana jayega
 The West Indies batsmen must have been happy not to see Ashwin in India's bowling line-up
 32 saal ke star of spinner aswin westeindies ke khilaaf shandaar record rakhte hai
 He has taken 60 wickets in 21 innings of 11 Tests against the Caribbean team during his career
 aswin ko nahin khilaane kaa faisla sirf ballebaaji ke aadhaar par nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It can be believed that Jadeja is doing well with the bat
 unhone pichhali 7 test pariyon main do baar 80 se zyada ke score kiye, jisamen unka ek shatak bhi shaamil he
 On the other hand, Ashwin's batting has become comparatively weak
 is match main aswin ek behatar vikalp ho sakate the
 Anyway, the logic of the batting ability of No
 8 (jadeja has landed at this number) does not hold much power at the moment
 yadi bhartiya team england yaa australia main khel rahi hoti, to yah samaj main aata he- jahaan nichle kram par bhi daaromadar rahata he
 But this is not the case in the West Indies
 duusari taraf westeindies kii team main kai baayen haath ke ballebaajon ke rahete aswin ko jarur aajmaana chahie tha
 The only reason in favor of Jadeja could possibly be considered his continuity
 isse pehle disambar main aswin ke chotil hone kii vajah se baayen haath ke spinner jadeja ne australia main siries ke aakhri do test (melbern or sidney) maiche khele the
 In Melbourne, Jadeja conceded only 45 runs in 25 overs and took two wickets
 duusari pari main 32 overon kii gendbaaji main unhone 3 wicket chatkaaye
 And then concluded the series with a bowling analysis of 32–11–73–2 in Sydney
 jaahir he is vajah se antiga main team chune jane ke samay jadeja ko praathamikta mili
 Ashwin's stunning record against the West Indies, Ashwin has had many successes against the West Indies both with bat and ball
 aswin ke sabhi 4 test shatak westeindies ke khilaaf aae hai or 552 ranon ke saath, unke balle se 50 se adhik kaa everej rahaa he
 Ashwin scored 21 times with 5 wickets in 11 Tests against the Windies
 85 kii ausat se 60 wicket jatke hai
 The last time India toured the Caribbean in 2016 was when Ashwin took 17 wickets in four Tests
 lagaataar chauthe test main aswin ko baahar baithna padaayah lagaataar chauthaa test he, jisamen aswin baahar baithe hai
 He last played in the first match of the border-gavaskar Trophy in Australia
 disambar main edilade test main kul chah wicket lene ke baad chauthi subah chotil ho gaye

 Behind the scenes, he took many decisions that had a profound and far-reaching impact on the country's politics
 padhie, unke bare main paanch baaten, jo aapane pehle nahin suni hongi
 1
 veepi kaa ikkaa the arunalogon ko lagata he ki arun nehru ko indira gandhi raajnneeti main laayi
 But this was actually VP Singh's master stroke
 1980 main indira do jagah se chunaav ladiin
 From Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh and Medak in Andhra
 donon siton par jeet milane ke baad unhone raibareli se istipha dena tay kiya
 The search for a new candidate began here
 us vakt uttar pradesh main congress ke do bade netaaon hemavathi nandan bahuguna or mukhyamantri veepi singh main varchasv kii ladaai chal rahi thi
 Bahuguna put forward the name of Jagpat Dubey, who is working in the parliamentary seat of Indira Gandhi
 arun nehru indira ke chachere bhai lagate the
 Was in a company in Kolkata, but used to come to Rae Bareli for funding etc
 during elections
 veepi unke vyaktitv se waakif the
 He felt that this man was good at getting things done and making decisions
 unhone indira gandhi ko salaah di ki raibareli kii seat gandhi parivaar kii pratishtha ban chuki he, isliye yah beton use saunpna chahie jo is viraasat kaa hissedaar ho
 In this way Arun Nehru's name became final
 bahuguna ke prastaav ke jawaab main yah veepi kaa ikkaa tha
 2
 piem house par niyantranrbareli se jitkar arun nehru jab saansad bane, tab indira bahut sari raajnneetik chijen vyavasthit kar rahi thim
 Sanjay Gandhi was killed in the accident and Rajiv Gandhi was on a political apprentice
 us vakt yashpal kapur jaise kai ghaagh political manager hua karte the, jo ataichi lekar kisi awaas par jate or bada raajnneetik her-pher ho jaataa tha
 Arun Nehru set up such a consummate political manager
 piem offis to nahin, lekin piem house kii satta unke ishaaron par jarur ghoomane lagi
 Arun went on to become the trusted of Indira Gandhi and remained so till her stay
 3
 Who made Rajiv the PM After Indira Gandhi's assassination, it was Arun Nehru's proposal that Rajiv Gandhi be made the Prime Minister
 unhone or veepi singh ne tay kiya tha ki aise halaat main jab kai congress netaa singhaasana kii ore dekh rahe hai, kisi bhi tarah kii antarim vyavastha thik nahin rahegi
 By doing so, he also gained the trust of Rajiv Gandhi in one stroke
 jab rajeev ko yah prastaav diya gaya to unhone paas baithe varisht kendriya mantri pranab mukherjee kaa man jaanane ke liye unase poocha ki aise halaat main kise satta sanbhaalani chahie
 Pranab, without any shrewdness, clearly stated as a leader that in such a situation only the senior-most minister handles the work
 siyasat ke tippaneekar kehete hai ki yaheen se congress main pranab mukherjee kaa patan shuru hua
 He did not even find a place in the 1984 cabinet and in 1986 he left the Congress to form his own party
 4
 Arun Nehru became the Minister of Internal Security in the Arunarajiv Gandhi government, shouting from the room
 rajeev doon skool se padhe the
 When he became PM, many colleagues of the Doon School gathered around him
 lekin arun kaa kabhi un logon se takaraav nahin hua
 The confrontation occurred when the Quattrocchi family joined the Ajijs of the Gandhi family
 arun nehru samet veepi singh or aarif mohamd khan bhi is baat se khafa ho gaye
 In Arun and Rajiv, the distance began to grow
 dilli main hawa thi ki rajeev gandhi arun kaa mantralay badalanaa chaahate hai
 Before the commencement of the Cabinet formation exercise, Rajiv was calling and talking to his ministers
 rajeev kii cabinet main mantri the, abdul gaffur
 He was sitting outside waiting for his meeting with Rajiv, that he saw Arun Nehru coming out from inside speaking in a loud voice
 lag rahaa tha ki unki rajeev gandhi se garmagaram bahes hui he
 When Abdul arrived, Rajiv told him that i am thinking of changing your department
 abdul bole ki main to thik kaam kar rahaa hum
 Why then? And why change, you resign
 rajeev gandhi ne kaha, thik he istipha de do or iske liye kora kaagaj tak mangava liya

 punarvaas kii koshish ke peeche kouniske baad congress main kai baad badlaav hue
 VP Singh left the Congress
 1989 main arun nehru janata dal ke tikat par chunaav lade or jite
 But now his stature was reduced
 1998-99 main arun ne bijepi se raibareli chunaav ladaa, lekin haar gaye
 There was a big whisper in the political corridors about who was the man behind his political rehabilitation efforts
 siyaasi jaankaron kii maane to vah arun jetali the
 He was a sharp-witted lawyer and had an important role in the court of the Bofors case
 rashtriya morcha ko fiks karne main bhi unka role tha
 This was rewarded by making him Additional Solicitor General in the VP Government

 # indvsl # nidahastrophyimagine Dhoni playing a Rishabh Pant like innings, and we would have had 'legends' like Agarkar and Manjrekar asking for his retirement! Well, that's also because, people notice such experts only with such comments

 Dhoni said after his team's seven-wicket win here on Wednesday night, 'the last few overs were very encouraging

 dhoni ne kaha, ‘dwen smith ne jis wicket par ballebaaji kii vah alag tarah kaa wicket tha
 But later there was a lot of bounce which made it difficult to score runs
 ’royles ke captain shen watasan ne is haar ko behad niraashajanak qaraar diya or kaha ki unki team ko ek acchhee bhagidaari kii jarurat thi
 Watson said, 'this defeat is very disappointing
 hamen ek acchhee saajhedaari kii darkaar thi lekin aisa nahin ho paaya
 Our bowlers performed well in front of their strong batting

 unhone naabad 36 ran banane ke alaava 33 ran dekar chaar wicket bhi liye

 jadeja ne kaha, ‘gendbaaji karne main adhik majaa aayaa
 When i went to bat, the situation was critical
 isliye main aakhir tak tike rahanaa chahta tha or saubhaahgya main aisa karne main safal rahaa
 The wicket was very slow and the ball was also taking a turn
 isliye maine sahi aria main gend kii

 22 disambar ko dilli ke jantar-mantar par janata parivaar ke bikhare sadsy ekikrut rup main narendra modi se chunaav ke dauraan kiye gaye unke vaadon kaa hisaab maangane ke liye ikattha ho rahe hai
 After the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the challenge of SP, RJD, INLD, JD (S) and JDU is to save their stronghold
 jantar mantar par hone vaala pradarshan in dalon ke saath aane kii shuruyaat he
 Former Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has already said that these parties can together form a new unified party
 haalanki janata parivaar ke sadsy dalon ke judane or bikharane ke itihaas par najar daale, to nae ‘samaajawaadee janata dal’ kaa rasta mushkilon bharaa dikhataa he
 After two meetings in Delhi, SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav has been tasked to draft the draft of a new unified party
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki kya nayaa dal maujuuda centre sarkaar kii badali hui vikaas kendrit raajnneeti ke saamne chunauti pesh kar paaegaa? kya in netaaon ke paas maujuuda aarthik niti kaa koi vaikalpik model he
 a look at these challenges of the new Samajwadi Janata Dal
 
 Without a lack of trust, the Janata Parivar, which was built on the hand of Congressism, got broken many times
 phir kai dal ubhare or phir toote
 This sequence has happened so many times that even a large part of the people do not know how many times the family members are broken and scattered
 lihaaja mulaayam singh, nitish kumaar or lalu jaise netaaon ke saamne janata dal kaa ekikaran karnaa bada masalaa nahin he, unke liye badi chunauti ekikrut nae dal ke liye janata kaa bharosa jutanaa hoga
 Whether it is the image of a man of development, whether it is of Mulayam Singh or of Lalu Yadav or of Nitish Kumar, none of these could draw a big line from the image of development man of Narendra Modi
 bade bijness gharaanon se jitani kareebi narendra modi kii he, inamen kisi netaa kii bhi nahin
 The days of Lalu Prasad Yadav's rule in Bihar are repeated as Jungleraj
 upi main kai baar shashan karne ke baavjood mulaayam singh yadav or unke bete kii sarkaar apni chhavi kathith rup se udyogpatiyon ke anukul nahin bana pai he
 At the same time, the image of Nitish Kumar, who directly confronted Narendra Modi on many issues, is also confined in the realm of electricity, roads and water
 narendra modi ne apane chunaav prachaar or sambodhano main itani baar vikaas-vikaas doharaaya he ki aam aadmi bhi ab vikaas or aarthik pragati kii baat par jor dene laga he
 This issue is one of the most serious challenges facing these leaders
 saamaajik nyaay or rachanaatmak vikaas kii baaten mek in india ke aage ab dhundhala gai hai
 Narendra Modi has enhanced his image of Vikas Purush by connecting his association with Make in India and business houses
 aarthik morche par ab nae samaajawaadee janata dal ko modi se badi lakeer khinchni hogi or ye mumkin nahin dikhataa
 Who will lead the new party, BJP led by Narendra Modi is continuously flaunting its victory in the state elections
 maharashtra or haryana main usne apane dam par sarkaar banaai he or anya rajyon main bhi badhat hasil karne kii ore he
 The question is also that if a new unified socialist Janata Dal emerges, then who will lead it
 kya mulaayam singh iske netaa honge
 Will the rest of the leaders be able to trust Mulayam Singh
 in sabhi dalon ko milakar dekha jaae to loksabhaa main inke sadasyon kii sankhya 15 he, jabaki rajyasabha main inaki sthiti thodi majboot dikhti he
 However, in political circles, Mulayam Singh is said to be the most non-trusted leader
 2014 ke chunaavon se pehle mulaayam upie sarkaar ke khilaaf kai baar muddon par alag gathjod banane ke baad palat gaye the, lekin ab centre main upie kii sarkaar nahin he or is baat kii sambhaavna kam he ki mulaayam bijepi ke saath jaaenge
 Among these, there is little possibility that Mulayam will work under the leadership of Nitish or any other leader, as well as the influence of these leaders outside UP and Bihar
 apane rajyon kii dasha nahin badal paaenjanta dal ke ahm sadasyon main se ek rahe lalu yadav ne bihar main 15 saal shashan kiya, lekin apane rajya kii sthiti badal paane main lalu naakaam rahe
 On the basis of the yadav-muslim equation, Lalu ruled for a long time, but these formulas will now work, it is difficult to say
 mulaayam singh yadav ke bete upi main purna bahumat kii sarkaar chalaa rahe hai or isse pehle mulaayam singh yadav bhi upi par shashan kar chuke hai
 But even today, electricity, water and road problems in UP and Bihar remain the same
 haalanki nitish kumaar ne in sabake mukaable behatar kaam kiya, lekin ek seemaa se aage vah bhi nahin ja paae
 These regional leaders who rule on the strength of Dalits, Minorities and Backwards in their respective states are on the slopes of age (except Nitish)
 unki raajnneeti kaa sarvshereshth samay biit chukaa he or desh kaa madhyam varg bahut aage bad chukaa he
 In politics, it seems impossible for these parties to have an alternative to Narendra Modi without new thinking and policy in a time dominated by GDP rather than bread
 hameshaa se aisa mana jaataa rahaa he ki kisi bhi rishte main pyaar or vishwaas kaa hona bahut jaruri he
 But it is often seen that people except their partners are seen flirting with someone else
 aisa sirf ladke hi nahin karte ladkiyaan bhi kai baar apane boyfriend ke hote hue bhi duusare ladakon ke saath pyarbhari baaten karne lagati hai
 If something like this is happening to you too, there is nothing to be surprised
 kai ladakiyon ko bahut zyada care or atension chahie hota he or agar unhen apneboyfriend se ye nahin miltaa to wo duusare ladakon kii taraf khinchne lagati hai
 There can be many more reasons that knowing them can help you
 1
 Sometimes people do this to maintain freshness in the relationship and consider flirting to be good
 ho saktaa he aapaki partner sirf masti-majaak kar rahi ho to pehle sari baaten jaan lenaa hi behatar he
 2
 kahin aapaki partner aapke hote hue bhi khud ko akelaa to mahasoos nahin karti
 Many times girls do this by feeling insecure
 3
 Does your girlfriend ask for too much attention? If this is the case then you need to take great care of him and give him love because girls of such nature never change
 4
 The fourth reason may be that you are not romantic and therefore your partner considers you a boring person
 kai baar aisi samasya bhi flert karne kaa kaaran ban jaati he
 5
 agar apakipartner aapako jalaane ke liye aisa karti haito phir aapako pareshaan hone kii jarurat nahin kyonki vah aapkaa dhyaan apni taraf khinchne ke liye aisa kar rahi he
 6
 kai baar ladkiyaan rishta khatm karne ke liye bhi aisa karti hai or agar aapako aisa lag rahaa he to aapako jindagi main aage badhane kii jarurat he
