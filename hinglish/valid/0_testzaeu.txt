 Lev Trotsky was a Marxist revolutionary and theorist of Russia, a Soviet politician and the founder and first leader of the Red Army
 roosi kranti ke baad hue bheeshan grih yuddh main vijayi rahi laal sena kii kaman trotski ke haath main hi thi
 As a theorist, he contributed to Marxist discourse through the theory of permanent revolution
 iske saath hi trotski ne ek niyam kaa pratipaadan bhi kiya ki poonjeewaad ke vikaas kaa str sabhi jagah ek sa nahin hota jiskaa parinaam pichde deshon main saamaajik or aitihaasik vikaas ke do charnon ke ek saath ghatit ho jane main nikalataa he
 This theoretical achievement of Trotsky in the first decade of the twentieth century amid the ongoing debate among Marxists reinforced the logic of revolutionizing an industrially backward country like Russia
 lenin ke dehanth ke baad trotski ne stallin dwaara pravartit ek desh main samaajwaad kii sthapana ke siddhant kaa virodh kiya, lekin ve party ke bheetar hone vaale sangharsh main akele padate chale gayi
 He was first expelled from the party, and then deported for conspiring against the Soviet state
 nishkasana ke dauraan trotski ne stallin ke netritv main ban rahe soviet sangh kii kadi aalochana karte hue use naukarshah, nirankush or rajkeey poonjeewaadi rajya kii sangya di
 Wandering around the world to escape the Soviet secret police, Trotsky composed classic texts such as 'permanent Revolution', 'revolution Bitred' and 'the History of Russian Revolution' in three volumes
 vishwa-kranti ke apane sapane ko dharti par utaarne ke liye unhone chauthe communist international kii sthapana bhi kii jise koi khaas kamyaabi nahin mili
 During the expulsion, he lost his life at the hands of a Stalin agent in Mexico
 trotski ke anuyaayiyon ne duniya ke kai deshon main choti- choti communist partiyaan bana rakhi hai
 His ideas have been labeled Trotskyism as an alternative to Soviet-style communism
 trotski kaa asli naam lev davidovich bronstin tha
 At an early age he was attracted to Marxism and while doing underground politics adopted the secret name of 'trotsky'
 unke jivan ko teen bhaagon main baant kar dekha ja saktaa he
 The first part is when, like an independent sign of Russian Marxism, he came close to Lenin while participating in the revolutionary movement and then refused to support him
 doosraa hissaa 1917 se shuru ho kar 1923 tak chalaa jab unhone lenin ke saath kandhe se kandhaa mila kar soviet kranti ko agrgati pradaan kii
 After this, the third phase of his life began when he waged a campaign against Stalinism to defend the benefits of the revolution
 bolshevik netaaon main keval trotski hi aise the jinhen lenin kaa pramukh saathi hone ke baavjood unke anuyaayi ke taur par nahin dekha jaataa tha
 In 1903, when the Russian Social People's Labor Party split between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, Trotsky did not support Lenin
 shuruyaat main unhone bolshavism kii yah kah kar ninda kii ki yah to sarvhaara kii nahin balki sarvhaara par taanaashaahee kaa formula he
 At that time he suspected that there were conspiratorial leaders like Lenin Robespierre because of which Russia's socialist movement would be misguided
 us samay trotski kaa vichaar tha ki gupt raajnneetik kaam karne vaali peshewar krantikariyon kii anushaasit party ke haath main kranti kii kaman dene se samaajwaad kaa lakshya nahin hasil kiya ja saktaa
 He was in favor of forming a party of a more democratic and open character
 1905 main ve saint petersburg kii soviet netaa ke rup main ubhare
 This first Soviet of Russia played a major role in the 1905 revolution, and Trotsky considered it a model of authentic democracy
 kranti vifal ho jane ke baad zaarshahi ne unhen giraftaar karke siberia bhej diya
 Trotsky escaped and spent the next decade in Europe
 is dauraan santhnik rup se ve menshavikon ke saath rahe
 When he returned to Russia in 1917, the Zarashahi had collapsed due to the February revolution
 ab ve bolshevikon ke saath aa gayi kyonki unhen laga ki unke or lenin ke vichaaron main kaaphi samanta aa chuki he
 Lenin himself was an admirer of Trotsky's political and theoretical abilities
 bolshevik party main trotski kaa kad teji se badha
 He participated in peace talks with the Germans as the commissioner of foreign affairs
 faujee kamisar ke rup main trotski ne laal sena ke gathan main pramukh bhoomika nibhaai or grih yuddh main uskaa shandaar netritv kiya
 These successes led to Trotsky being viewed as one of Lenin's possible successors
 lenin kii hi tarah trotski ko roosi sarvhaara varg kii rachanaatmak kshamtaaon main gaharaa vishwaas tha
 Based on this belief, he had a special kind of theoretical understanding that came out of the study of world capitalism
 trrotski kaa vichaar tha ki apane pichhadepan se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye kisi desh ko un charnon se kramvaar guzarane kii jarurat nahin hoti jinase viksit desh guzar chuke hote hai
 Symptoms of backwardness emerge along with backwardness in these countries
 is siddhanth ke aadhaar par vishleshan karte hue trotski ne dikhaaya ki rus kaa adhikansh bhaag pichhadaa or aviksit he lekin usamen pashchimi prabhaavon ne bhi ghuspaith kar lee he
 Developed methods of economic production and relations are being adopted in many places
 audyogic vikaas ke in mukaamon ne shahari kendron main ek acha-khaasaa sarvhaara varg or ek pashchimikrut bauddhik abhijan paidaa kar diya he
 As a result, radical forms of political resistance and activism have become prevalent
 chunki udyogikaran upar se thopa gaya he isliye sthaneey poonjipati varg kamjor he, lekin sarvhaara varg majboot he
 The capitalist class is afraid of carrying out a democratic revolution and is unable to fulfill its historical obligation due to its inability, hence this responsibility has fallen on the shoulders of the proletariat
 kisaanon ko apane netritv main lete hue unke saath morcha bana kar majdoor varg ko samantshahi or uske sabhi avasheshon kaa unmoolan karte hue samaajwaad kii taraf badhanaa hoga
 Trotsky called his theory a permanent revolution
 1850 main marks communist lig kii general concil ko sambodhit karte hue is pad kaa istemaal kar chuke the
 According to Trotsky, farmers with a pre-capitalist mindset will not be able to support the workers in this revolutionary process for very long
 unki dilchaspee jameen kaa malikana mil jane tak hi rahegi
 a front made with farmers that paves the way for revolution will prove to be a hindrance in the creation of socialism
 isliye ek desh main, visheshtah rus main, samaajwaad kaa nirmaan tab tak safal nahin ho saktaa jab tak anya deshon main bhi kranti nahin ho jaati
 Therefore, Russia's revolution should be seen as the initial phase of the world revolution, especially in developed countries
 dilachasp baat yah he ki trotski kii in baton or pratham vishwayuddh ke baad lenin dwaara pratipaadit kai siddhanton main kaafii samanta prathit hoti he
 Some Trotskyists have also alleged that Trotsky's principles were used by Lenin in the 1917 revolution
 yah alag baat he ki khud trotski ne 1917 main lenin kaa netritv sweekaar karne ke baad kabhi aisa nahin kaha
 After Lenin's death, Stalin wrote a paper about the construction of socialism in a country
 is maamle main bukharin jaise siddhantkaar bhi stallin ke saath the
 But Trotsky warned that the implementation of this principle would have disastrous consequences for Russia
 unhone kaha ki kheti ke samuhikeekaran kaa samay abhi nahin aayaa he
 Trotsky was also against limiting the comintern established by Lenin to the tools of Soviet foreign policy
 unka tark tha ki soviet sangh ko udyogikaran or aadhunikeekaran ke raste par jarur chalanaa chahie, par in uplabdhiyon ko samaajwaad kaa paryaay nahin samajha ja saktaa
 Socialism means higher productivity of labor, consequently better standard of living and society like the most developed forms of its capitalism
 yah tabhi ho saktaa he ki jab sarvhaara ke haath main vishwa-arthvyavastha kii bagdor ho
 Trotsky maintained that the Soviet system under Stalin should only be considered transitional
 abhi is baat kii guarantee nahin kii ja sakati ki iskaa vikaas samaajwaad main hoga yaa yah patit ho kar poonjeewaad ke kisi sanskaran main badal jaaegi
 Trotsky believed that the bureaucracy of Russia was taking the form of a new class
 bhale hi soviet samaaj rajkeey poonjeewaad kii sthiti main na pahunchaa ho, lekin uski sthiti mazdooron ke ek kamatar rajya jaisi to he hi
 The special feature of Trotsky's ideas was that he was opposed to the tendencies of seeing Marxism as the infallible medicine of every problem
 isi tarah ve marxvad ke naam par kala-sahitya or gyaan ke vibhinn kshetron ko ek vishesh disha main dhakele jane ke bhi khilaaf the
 Despite his radical views, he could not do a majority of the party in his favor
 party ke bheetar unhen ek aise netaa ke rup main dekha jaataa tha jo sankat aane par to karishmai netritv pradaan kar saktaa he, lekin party ke bheetar hone vaali rosemara kii uthaa-patake se nibatane main dilchaspee nahin rakhata, or jo apni bauddhik chamak-damak main akelaa rahanaa pasand karata he
 When there was no revolution in Europe as Trotsky had hoped, he blamed the Stalinian project of abandoning the goal of world revolution and trying to build socialism in only one country
 trotski ne yah kabhi nahin mana ki stalinkaaleen galatiyon kii jad main party or raajnneeti kaa leninist-bolshevik vichaar he jiske kaaran ek party dwaara sanchalit rajya puure samaaj ko apana taabedaar banane main kaamyaab ho gaya he
 Indeed, Trotsky never reiterated his harsh criticisms of Lenin and Bolshevism from 1903 to 1914, even though he suffered expulsion in the third period of life
 swatantra bharat main saath ke dashak main angreji hataaon-hindi lao ke andolan kaa sutarapaat raamamanohar lohia ne kiya tha
 This movement can be calculated in a few movements so far
 lohia kaa maananaa tha kii lokbhasha ke bina loktantr sambhav nahin he
 In 1962-63, the Jana Sangh also joined this campaign, which was waged since 1957
 lekin lohia ji ke nidhan, dakshin main hindi-virdohi aandolan, rajanetaaon kii rajnatik laalasaaon ke kaaran yah aandolan safal na ho sakaa
 Dr
 Ram Manohar Lohia, the pioneer of socialist politics, aimed at all language thinking and movement to remove the domination of English from Indian public life
 lohia ko angareji bhashaa maatr se koi aapatti nahin thi
 He was also not opposed to the rich literature of English, but he respected English as a language of thought and research
 hindi ke prachaar-prasar main mahatma gandhi ke baad sabase zyada kaam raamamanohar lohia ne kiya
 He was in favor of virtuous socialism
 unhone loksabhaa main kaha tha- When the Indian Constitution came into force in 1950, it was also provided that till 1965, English can be used as per convenience, but after that Hindi will be given the status of official language
 isse pehle ki sanvaidhanik samaysima puri hoti, dow raamamanohar lohia ne 1957 main angreji hataao muhim ko sakriy andolan main badal diya
 He started promoting this movement all over India
 1962-63 main jansangh bhi is andolan main sakriy rup se shaamil ho gaya
 But during this time there was opposition to the states movement of South India
 tamilnadu main annadurai ke netritv main diemke party ne hindi virdohi andolan ko or tej kar diya
 After this, violent forms of agitation were also seen in some cities
 kai jagah dukaanon ke upar likhe angreji ke sinboard tode jane lage
 On the other hand, due to the close of the 1965 deadline, the anti-hindi movement in Tamil Nadu also became very aggressive
 yahaan darjanon chaatro ne aatmadah kar lee
 In view of this movement, the Central Government passed the Official Language Act in Parliament in 1963
 isamen praavdhaan kiya gaya ki 1965 ke baad bhi hindi ke saath-saath angreji kaa istemaal rajkaaj main kiya ja saktaa he
 An attempt was made to dismiss the 'english Hatao' movement in those days, saying that if Hindi is replaced by English, then the dominance of Hindi will prevail and the coastal languages will be marginalized
 sattadhariyon ne hindi ko samrajyavaadee bhashaa ke ke rup main pesh kar hindi banaam anya bhartiya bhashaaon kaa vivaad ched ise rashtriya ekta evam akhandta ke liye khatra bataa diya
 It was not a language to be added to the country, but made it a language of the country
 lohia ne is baat kaa khandan karte hue kaha ki swadhinata andolan main hindi ne desh jodak bhashaa kaa kaam kiya he
 Unity has been established in the country, there is a possibility in this language even further
 saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki yadi hindi ko rajkaaj, prashasan, court-kachhari kii bhashaa nahin bananaa chaahate to isaki jagah anya kisi bhi bhartiya bhashaa ko bana diya jaae
 If necessary, Hindi should also be included
 lekin bharat kii maatrubhaasha kii jagah angreji kaa varchasvvaad nahin chalanaa chahie
 When Lohia talks of 'removing English', it does not mean 'bringing Hindi'
 balki angareji hataane ke naare ke peeche lohia kii ek khaas samajhadaari he
 Lohia was in favor of bringing prestige to Indian languages in place of English imposed on the Indian public
 19 sitambar 1962 ko hyderabad main lohia ne kaha tha, For him, self-language was not the issue of politics but the question of his self-respect and the dream of filling millions with crores of inferior glands with confidence - dakshin ke hindi-virdohi ugr andolanon ke daur main lohia puure dakshin bharat main angareji ke khilaaf tathaa hindi va anya bhartiya bhashaaon ke paksh main andolan kar rahe the
 Unfortunately, some people in South India, because of their inclination towards Hindi, Lohia were seen as representatives of the North and Brahmin culture
 dakshin bharat main unke ‘angareji hataao’ ke naare kaa matlab ‘hindi lao’ liya jaataa tha
 Because of this, Lohia had to face many difficulties in holding meetings in South India
 san 1961 main madras or coimbatore main sabhaaon ke dauraan un par pathar tak phenke gaye
 Hyderabad was the center of activities of Lohia and the Socialist Party amid such incidents
 ‘angareji hataao’ andolan kii kai mahatvapurn baithken hyderabad main hui
 The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Party of Tamil Nadu launched a movement of 'hindi Hatao' against this movement which took the form of a separatist movement to a extent
 nehru ne san 1963 main samvidhan sanshodhan karke hindi ke saath angreji ko bhi anishchit kaal tak bharat kii sah-rajbhasha kaa darja de diya
 In 1965, the English was going to be completely removed and it was made 'permanent'
 1967 ke navambar maah main kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay ke chaatraneta devvrat majumdaar ke netritv main 'angreji hataao aandolan' kiya gaya tha jiskaa asar puure desh par padaa
 At that time Devavrata Majumdar, an engineering student, was the president of BHU Students' Union

 Doctor Henry 'hank' Pimm, a biophysicist and expert at the Security Operations Center, discovered a chemical substance that the user could use to change its shape
 isaki khoj karne ke baad hi unhone ek super hero banane kaa faisla kiya
 Wearing a helmet that controlled the ants, Pim became the shape of an insect, and then soon became known as the mystery-solving ant-man
 unhone apni premika, jenet vine dian ko apni khoj ke bare main bataaya, or aparaadh se ladane main vah bhi wasp ke rup main unki madad karne lagi
 They both became founding members of Avengers, where they fought many enemies such as the mad scientist Egghead, Mutant Whirlwind, and Pim's own robot Ultron

 kisi ghoomanevaali mashin ke ang ko sanbhaalane ke liye dharuk yaa bering kaa upyog hota he
 It is a mechanical device that facilitates relative motion with minimal friction between two or more parts of the machine
 dhuree yaa takale ke us bhaag ko, jo bering par rakhaa jaataa he, jarnal kaha jaataa he
 The journal rotates within the torrent and thus bears the weight of the torrent axis and the forces exerted on it and allows the axle to rotate without interruption
 saral dharuk ek nalee ke samaan hota he, jisamen dhuree ko daal diya jaataa he
 But for fast-moving axles, or where friction can cause heat to deteriorate, the torso is made into two layers which are of different types
 kisi mashin kaa dharuk aisa bhaag he jisapar mashin ke chalane se har samay bhaar rahata he or dhuree ke ghoomane ke kaaran dharuk kuch na kuch ghisata hi rahata he
 If the Dharuk is not made properly then it has to be replaced very soon
 isliye sab baton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue dharuk ko is prakaar bananaa padataa he ki vah kam se kam ghise tathaa ghise hue bhaagon ko suvidha se badla ja sake
 The Dharuk consists of two parts, one is called Bandhani, which is tightened in the machine and within this Bandhan the Dharuk is made of brass "gun" metal, or bronze
 isi prakaar kii duusari dhaatuen bhi is bhaag ke banane main kaam aati hai
 The spindle rotates within this part
 upar bataaya ja chukaa he ki yaa to dharuk ko nalee ke samaan ek bhaag main banaaya jaataa he, yaa isko do bhaagon main is prakaar banaate hai ki donon bhaag milakar nalee ke samaan ho jaaen
 The axis is between the two legs p1 and p2 of Dharuk
 dharuk kaa neeche kaa paat pa2 bandhani ke ardhgolakaar sthaan main baitha diya jaataa he
 The interpolation is placed to prevent this bridge from rotating
 is paat main dhuree ko rakhkar paat pa2 ko iske upar lagaakar topi t se argali dwaara kas diya jaataa he
 a hole is made in the upper part of the cap, giving oil or lubricant
 tel yaa snehak chhed chha main se hota hua bheetar dhuridhar main bane hue khaanchon main chalaa jaataa he or jab dhuree gumti he to snehak dhuree tathaa dharuk ke bich ek jhilli bana detaa he, jiske kaaran dhuree keval snehak kii is jhilli par hi gumti he
 Therefore, the wear of the torrent is very low and that too before the axle is fully occupied and at the time of its stop
 yadi snehak thik samay par diya jaataa rahe to dharuk bahut dinon tak chalata he
 The torrents of modern design are made differently
 kaarkaanon main, jahaan lambii dhuriyon par kai kai dharuk hote hai, dharukon ke aakalpan main iskaa dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki dhuree kaa sanrekhan khadi tathaa kshaitij disha main vyavasthaapi penchon se thik kiya ja sake
 The bottom of the holder of sharp and heavy axles contains an agar of oil or lubricant
 kuch dharukon main neeche ke bhaag main tel se bhare hue talp rahete hai
 These talp live between the axis and the dhruk and from the talpa a light goes through the hole into the oil well
 isi batti ke dwaara talp ko har samay tel miltaa rahata he
 There are two methods of sending oil between the torrents, by gravity or by pressure
 yah tel bheetar jaakar dhuree ke ghoomane par jo jhilli banaata he uske mahattam nipid kaa sthaan dhuree kii raftaar, bhaar or iske ghoomane kii disha par nirbhar he
 If the load is applied on the horizontal axis, which is moving in the counterclockwise direction, the center of maximum pressure will be found on the right side of the middle vertical line at an angle of 10 ° to 45 ° and this angle will be based on the value of load and speed
 kam gati or adhik bhaar ke kaaran mahattam daab kaa centre lagbhag dharuk ke pende main hoga
 The area of minimum pressure will be to the right of the vertical line at the top for this axis
 yadi dhuree ke ghoomane kii disha badal di jaae to mahattam tathaa nunatam daab ke vindu usee kone par khadi centre rekha ke bai ore honge
 For holders in which oil is entrapped, the oil should go in place of minimum pressure
 yadi mukhya bering par bhaar he to dharukon ke upree bhaag dwaara tel dene se bhi kaam chal jaataa he
 Where oil is given by pressure, it would be better to send oil from near the place of maximum pressure
 is sthaan ko usee disha main hona chahie jis ore dhuree gum rahi he
 Except for small holders, grooves are made in all other holders, due to which the oil is spread uniformly at all places
 ye khaanche tel ke nipid ke sthanon par nahin banaae jate, kyonki in sthanon par khaanche tel ko kam gharshan ke sthanon kii ore jane kaa avasar denge or tel kii jhilli thik prakaar nahin ban paaegi
 The main bearings or journals do not have grooves, but are only made in the torrents, but the grooves that move in the direction of rotation of the spindle are more profitable than the location of the oil
 thik prakaar tel die gaye dharuk kaa gharshan gunank, thr, tel ke lakshan par nirbhar he
 The effect of the metal of the torrent is above the coefficient of friction, it depends on the properties of the spindle and the formation of oil membranes and the spindle stop or lubricant
 maan len, tel kii thik jhilli ban gai he to sangharsh gunank tel, taap, gati or bhaar par aadhrut he
 The coefficient of friction is 0
005 or 0
002 for good lubricants and 0
05 or more for bad lubricants
 un sthanon par bina tel ke dharukon kaa upyog bhi hota he, jahaan yah dhyaan rakhana padataa he ki tel girane se mashin se bananevaale maal main kharabi na aa jaae, jaise kapadaa banaanevaali mashine
 If these machines have oily torrents, then the oil will fall on the cloth, which will spoil the cloth
 at: ye dharuk vividh prakaar ke hote hai
 In one stream, oil-soaked wood is applied, in the second, the part of brass is made of graphite, due to which the friction is greatly reduced
 isi prakaar or duusare dharuk bhi banaae jate hai, jinamein tel kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 Some speculators think that the diameter of the journal should be kept to a minimum, taking into account the power of the spindle, which causes minimal wear
 yah bhi bataaya jaataa he ki yadi dhuree kii gati adhik rakhni he to isapar bhaar bhi kam hi hona chahie
 But in modern assessors, it has been established that if the torrent is designed properly, then it can be put more weight along with the speed
 isse koi haani nahin hogi
 It has also been proved that reducing the length of the torch has more benefits, especially for the axis of high speed
 kam lambey dharukon main jhukaav nahin hoga
 Due to this the nipid will be equal at every place within Dharuk
 isliye dharuk kii lambaai uske vyas se kam rakhane se dhuree kii chaal bhi zyada kii ja sakati he or dhuree par bhaar bhi zyada daalaa ja saktaa he
 It should be noted that if the length of the bends is reduced more then the nipple within it will increase, which can cause a tightness in the axis and if the length is longer then the tilting in the talus can be created
 isliye dharuk kii lambaai tathaa vyas kaa anupaat aisa rakhana chahie jinase na to jhukaav kaa dar ho or na ghuri hi jakad sake
 For this reason this ratio is kept 1: 1
5 for the axle of the ship, 1
2: 2
5 for the installed engines, 2: 3 and 3: 4 for the simple heavy axle
 dharuk kai prakaar ke hote hai
 Each of them has different usage: khadi dhuree ke liye kilak dharuk banaaya jaataa he
 There is a band called "V", which is tightened in the machine
 is bandhani main pital kaa dharuk he, jisamen dhuree ko lagaaya jaataa hai
 The entire weight of the axle remains at the base of the torso
 isko ardhgolakaar banaaya jaataa he or isi bhaag main tel yaa snehak rahata he
 As a result of an examination, it has been found that if a groove is filled in the base of this torrent and oil is filled in it, then when the spindle moves, the oil moves upwards and exits through the axis
 yadi is baahar nikle hae tel ko phir se bheetar bhej diya jaae to is tel kaa upyog baar baar ho saktaa he or dharuk ke bheetar kabhi tel khatam nahin hoga
 Increasing the load on this type of axle will cause more pressure on the rivet, which may cause the torrent to fail
 isliye is prakaar ke dharuk par 15 kilogram prati varg centimetre se adhik daab nahi daali jaati
 Galpatta dharuk is used at higher pressures
 is prakaar ke dharukon kaa upyog un sthanon par hota he jahaan dhuree par adhik bhaar ho
 The brass of this torch is in two parts, in which the grooves are made according to the positions of the axles
 in khaanchon main dhuree ke padon ko baithaaya jaataa he or yah sanyukt ang bandhani main utaar diya jaataa he
 In this way, each position works differently and the axle load is divided in these positions
 in dharukon ko jal dwaara thanda rakhaa jaataa he
 If these fluids are kept properly and oil is also given at the right time, then they can tolerate more movement and pressure and can last for more days
 abhi tak jo dharuk bataae gaye hai unamem dhuree kaa tal dharuk ke tal par ghumta rahata he or sarpi gharshan ke kaaran donon kii dhaatu ghisti rahati hai
 To reduce this friction, cylinders or bullets are seated between the rotating soles
 is prakaar donon tal belanon par ghoomte hai or sarpi gharshan ke sthaan par belan gharshan kaam karata he, jiske kaaran taapan tathaa ghisaai bahut kam ho jaati he, parantu in dharukon ke ghis jane par duusare dharukon ke samaan inkaa vyavasthaapan nahin kiya ja saktaa, balki inako badalanaa hi padataa he
 These torrents are very strong and also provide more speed due to less friction
 goli gharuk bhi isi ke sadrush banaaya jaataa he
 Its tablets remain between the two arms
 antar keval yahi he ki goli dharuk main bhaar vinduon par hota he or belan dharuk main bhaar rekhaon par hota he
 Therefore, the weight should not be so high that the arms should be stacked or fabricated
 belan tathaa goli or baaju sab kathor ispaat ke bane hote hai
 All cylinders or bullets of a torrent need to be of the same size, otherwise a bullet of larger magnitude will carry more weight and the torrent will fail
 upar likhi gai baton se pataa chalegaa ki kisi dharuk ke thik kaam karne ke liye tel jaruri cheez he
 This oil forms a light membrane between the journal and the torrent, due to which the two metals cannot meet each other and the journal rotates on this membrane
 yadi kisi kaaran se dharuk main tel kam ho jaataa he to yah tel kii jhilli tut jaati he or jarnal kii dhaatu dharuk kii dhaatu se ragad khaane lagati he, jisase dharuk tathaa jarnal adhik garam ho jate hai
 This heating expands both metals and Dharuk grips the journal
 mashin kaa jarnal aisa bhaag he jisaki laagat dharuk se adhik hoti he or isaki kharaab hone se bachaaya jaataa he
 To save the same, white metal is filled in the grooves of Dharuk by making them
 jab kisi kaaran se dharuk tapakar jakadane lagati he tab yah dhaatu pighalkar jarnal or dharuk ke bich chalaa aata he or puri dhuree ruk jaati he
 Therefore, to move around with less heat and friction without a journal it is necessary to keep in mind two things: dharuk main gharshan ho to shaft kii kuch shakti dharuk main nasht hoti rahati he or upyogi kaary kii maatra kuch kam ho jaati he

 ek divasiy antarrashtriya ) cricket kii ek style he, jisamen do rashtriya cricket tiimon ke bich prati team 50 over khele jate hai
 Cricket World Cup is played according to this format
 ek divasiy antarrashtriya maichon ko "limited over international )" bhi kaha jaataa he, kyonki rashtriya tiimon ke bich simit over ke cricket match khele jate hai or yadi mausam kii vajah se vyavdhaan utpann hota he to ve hameshaa ek din main samaapt nahin hote
 mahatvapurn ek divasiy antarrashtriya or gharelu maichon main aksar do din kaa samay rakhaa jaataa he, jisame se doosraa din "reserve / arakshit" din hota he, taaki pehle din koi parinaam na nikalne kii sthiti main khel ko samaapt karne ke adhik avasar milen
 The international one-day game developed in the late twentieth century
 pehla ek divasiy match melborn cricket ground par 5 janvari 1971 ko australia or england ke bich khelaa gaya tha
 When the first three days of the third Test match were washed out due to rain, the officials decided to end the match and instead it was decided to play 40 ODI matches per team with six balls per over
 australia ne yah match 5 wicket se jeeta
 In the late 1970s, Carrie Packer introduced the rival World Series Cricket) competition and introduced several facilities for modern one-day international cricket, including colorful uniforms, white balls in milky lights and matches with black site screens and Multiple angles of cameras for television broadcasts, microphones to listen to players playing on the pitch, and on-screen No graphics included

 It is credited with making cricket a more professional sport
 mukhya praaroop main cricket ke niyam lagu hote hai
 However, in a one-day international, each team only bats for a limited number of overs
 ekadivasiy cricket ke shuruaati dinon main aam taur par prati team over sankhya 60 thi, lekin ab ise samaan rup se 50 over tak simit kar diya gaya he
 The game in simple language is as follows: overon kii sankhya main kami ke sthiti main, udhaaharan ke liye kharaab mausam ke kaaran, overon kii sankhya kam ho sakati he
 If for some reason the number of overs played by the team batting in the second innings is different from the team batting in the first innings, the result can be determined by the Duckworth – Lewis method
 dudhia roshni is tarah se lagaai jaati hai ki yah kshetrarakshan karne vaali team ko baadha na pahunchaae tathaa gend ke bhigane kii sthiti main captainon ko maidan par kapadaa rakhane kii anumati di gai he
 The bowling team is bound by the conditions of the fielding ban, according to which, in the event of a catch being taken for a specified number of overs, nine players including two players are required to be in the fielding zone
 paramparaagat rup se, kshetrarakshan pratibandh prayek pari ke pehle 15 overon ke liye lagu hota tha
 The ICC introduced the powerplay rules as new rules for ODI series starting on 30 July 2005 in a 10-month trial period
 powerple niyam ke tahat, kshetrarakshan pratibandh pehle 10 overon ke liye tathaa paanch-paanch overon ke do hisson main lagu hota he
 The team batting since October 2008 decides when to start one of the remaining two powerplays, and the fielding team determines when the second powerplay begins
 pehle powerple ke dauraan, 30 gaj ke daayre ke baahar do se adhik khilaadi khadey nahin kiye ja sakate 
 pehle 10 overon main yah bhi aavashyak he ki kam se kam do kshetrarakshak kaich lapakane kii najdiki sthitiyon main hon
 Regarding the powerplay, the ICC has announced that the captain of the fielding team from 1 October 2007 may choose to keep 3 players outside the 30-yard radius during two powerplays of five overs each
 yah niyam 1 oktober 2007 ko dambula stadium main srilanka va england ke bich khele gaye match main lagu kiya gaya tha
 Sri Lanka won the match by 119 runs
 vartmaan main duusare tathaa tisare, donon powerple ke dauraan 3 khilaadi 30 gaj ke daayre ke baahar khadey hote hai tathaa ek powerple ballebaaji karne vaali team dwaara chunaa jaataa he
 There was also a substitution rule in the test rules, according to which a replacement player was allowed to be involved in any position of the match
 toss se pehle timen apane sthanapann khilaadi ko namit karti thi, jise supersab kaha jaataa tha
 Supersub could bat, bowl, fielding or wicket keeping; The substituted player could not participate further in the game
 ise lagu karne ke chah maheenon main kaaphi had tak yah spasht ho gaya ki toss jeetne vaali team ke liye supersab adhik laabhakaari tha, jisase khel main asantulan paidaa hota tha
 In 2005, several international captains signed a "gentleman's Agreement" to end the rule
 ve aavashyaktaa ke anusaar supersab namit karte rahe, kintu unhen maidan main nahin utaara gaya
 On 15 February 2006, the ICC announced the intention to abolish the supersub rule from 21 March 2006

 The ICC followed this standard in 2009 and used these results to give teams a one-day rating for the four years following the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier Trophy

 In addition, the ICC has the authority to grant special one-day status to certain high-level tournaments, as a result of which the following countries have also participated in full one-day matches: 2005 main isisi ne pehali baar vivaadaaspad dhang se kai aise maichon ko ekadivasiy darja de diya tha, jiname bhaag lene vaali timen ek se adhik deshon ke khilaadiyon se bani thim
 These matches were: Asia Cricket XI ICC World XI match played in January 2005 as a World Cricket Tsunami Appeal to assist the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami victims and commercially sponsored ICC Super Series held in Melbourne on October 2005 Three matches of "australia vs ICC World XI"
 The subsequent matches had very few spectators, these were largely one-sided matches and they did not attract much attention from the cricket world
 yah ek aisa prayog tha, jo kai logon ke anusaar dobaaraa nahin doharaaya janaa chahie tathaa kai cricket sankhyikeevidon kaa maananaa he ki aise maichon ko aadhikarik ekadivasiy maichon main shaamil nahin kiya janaa chahie

 Chromosomes or chromosomes are fibrous nodules found in cells of all flora and fauna, which determine and transmit all genetic properties
 prayek prajati main gunasutron kii sankhya nishchit rahati hai
 The number of chromosomes in a human cell is 46, in pairs of 23
 iname se 22 gunasutra nar or maadaa main samaan or apane-apane jode ke samajaat hote he
 These are collectively called homologous chromosomes
 23wein jode ke gunasutra stri or purush main samaan nahin hote jinhe vishamjaat gunasutra kehete he
 In the structure of a chromosome, two substances are specifically incorporated - di en e hi anuvanshik padaarth he
 The structure of the DNA molecule consists of four organic compounds: two purines, two pyrimidines, one sugar-deoxyribose, and phosphoric acid
 purine main adinine or guanin hote he or pirimidine main thymin or cytosin 
 a molecule of DNA has two formulas, which ring around each other in a spiral form
 prayek di en e sutara main ek ke peeche ek chaaron carbonic samaakshar is kram se hote hai-thymin, cytosin, adinin or guanin, evam ve paraspar ek vishesh dhang se jude hote hai
 a unit of these four chambers and their related sugars and phosphoric acid molecule is a tetranucleotid and a DNA molecule is formed of several millennium tetranucleotids
 vibhinn praaniyon ke di en e kii vibhinnata kaa kaaran he - samaakshaaron ke anukram main antar hona
 DNA and a similar nucleic acid RNA combine with ultraviolet in the region of most 2,600 angstroms due to the presence of organic clear
 isi aadhaar par di en e kaa ek koshika sambandhi maatraatmak aagaman kiya jaataa he
 Two special types of centrosomes are found in beings
 ek to kuch deptra insecta main dimbhiy largranthi ke centrakon main paaya jaataa he
 These chromosomes are several hundred times longer and wider than ordinary chromosomes of the same species
 is kaaran inhen mahagunasutra kehete hai
 Their structure appears to be somewhat different from the simple centrosome and semisolid centers
 yahan ek gunasutra ke sthaan par ek anuprastha pankti aisi kanikaon kii hoti he jinamein abhiranjit hote kii yogyata adhik hoti hai
 All the corpuscles of many such transverse rows from one end of the chromosome to the other are identical and the corpuscles of the other rows have characteristics and differences
 in gunasutron ke adhik lambey hone ke kaaran yah samajha jaataa he ki inkaa purna rup se visarpelikaran hota he or kadachit protein kaa kuch badhaav bhi hota hai
 The reason for being wider is that a chromosome synthesizes another nucleus similar to its own
 saadhaaran avasthaa main samasutran ke samay ye donon sutara ek duusare se pruthak ho jate hai, parantu mahagunasutra main yah nahin hota
 The two sutras remain connected to each other
 mahagunasutra kii sankhya saadhaaran gunasutra kii sankhya kii aadhi hoti he, kyonki prayek sutara apane samaan duusare sutara se yugmit ho jaataa he
 This phenomenon is called somatic coupling
 jantuon main vicitra prakaar kaa ek or bhi gunasutra paaya jaataa he
 Its lampbrush is called chromosome
 ye gunasutra aise jantuon ke andon ke centrakon main paae jate hai jinamein andpit kii maatra adhik hoti he, jaise machhlee, ubhaychar, urag, pakshigan ityadi
 The chromosomes are made up of two coupled formulas similar to ordinary diplotene-diakinisis chromosomes
 donon yugmit sutara kuch sthanon par ek duusare se jude hote hai or shesh sthanon par ek duusaren se dur dur rahete hai
 These joints are considered kijma
 prayek sutara par, jisakon chromonima kehete hai, sthaan sthaan par vibhinn parisaan kii kanikas hoti hai jinako chromemrs kehete hai
 Each chromomier has a pair or more lateral clusters attached
 parshvapash bhi chromonima ke sadrush sutara kaa bana hota he, parantu iske chaaron ore rebonuclio-protein kanikas ekatrit ho jaati hai jisase ye sutara mote dikhaai dete hai
 Chromomers also breed with chromonima
 centrekaayen vishesh gunasutra par utpann hoti hai
 In most cells each chromosome has two integral clusters
 paripakv lingakoshikaon main ek kulak rah jaataa he
 Such animals and cells are said to be diploid, but some animals, especially plants, have more than two kulas of chromosomes
 yadi kisi dwiguneet praani ke cendraksutra dugune ho jaae, jisase uski koshikaaye main prayek sutara chaar chaar hon jaise, to aise praani kaa atopoliploid kehete hai
 If the chromosome of a diploid hybrid is doubled, such a creature is called an allopolyploid
 yadi ek dwiguneet praani kaa, jiskicendraksutra k1 k1 kha1 kha1 ga1 ga1 ityadi hai, kisi duusare praani se, jiske gunasutra k2 k2 kha2 kha2 ga2 ga2 ityadi hai, sankaran kiya jaae to uski santan ke gunasutra k1 k2 kha1 kha2 ga1 ga2 ityadi honge
 A1 a2 b1 b2 etc
 will be different from each other and there will not normally be coupling
 yadi is praani ke gunasutra dugune ho jaae to unki koshikaaye main k1 k1 k2 k2; kha1 kha1kha2 kha2; ga1 ga1 ga2 ga2, ityadi gunasutra honge
 This will be called allopolyploid
 poliploid main chaar se adhik kulak bhi ho sakate hai
 It is clear that the autopolyploid will produce quadruplexes in the zygotein state, because each of the four chromosomes of each type is present, and the coupling of the four formulas creates one quadrupole
 koshikavibhaajan ke samay prayek dhruv ko baraabar baraabar sankhya main gunasutra nahin milenge
 Often it happens that three threads reached a pole due to the breakdown of a quadrilateral and only one thread reached its opposite pole
 koshikavibhaajan ke ant par bane hue santati koshikaon main gunasutra yaa to adhik sankhya main honge yaa kam main or aise asantulan kaa parinaam yah hota he ki koshika mar jaati he
 This is why autotetraploids are much less fertile
 autotetraploid paudhe saadhaaran dwiguneet paudhon se bahut bade hote hai tathaa unke beej bhi bahut bade hote hai, jisase urvartaa kam hone par bhi ye gruhasthi ke liye adhik laabhadaayak siddh ho sakate hai
 By providing frost, or with the effect of some alkaloids, plant autopolyploids can be made
 elotetraploid main dasha iske vipareet hoti hai
 If the two primitive parent formulas are completely different from each other, the allopolyploid is functionally diploid and will be completely fertile
 jaise, yadi kisi sankar main k1 k2, kha1 kha2, ga1 ga2 se sutara sarvatha bhinn hon to aisa sankar bandhya hoga, parantu iske gunasutron ke dugune hone se yah avasthaa badal jaaygi
 Such cells will have formulas such as A1, 1A, 2A2, B1B1B2B2, C1C1, C2C2, etc
 and the branches that contain such cells will flower, because such cells will have successful myiotic division, coupled with A1A1, B1B1, etc
 
 datura stramonium main dwiguneet avasthaa main 12 jodi gunasutra hote hai or ardhasuthran ke samay dwisanyojak banate hai
 Its autopolyploid has 12 quaternary chromosomes and at the time of meiosis, 12 quiescent are formed
 isi bhanti primmula sinencis se dwiguneet paudhe main 12 jodi gunasutra hote hai or autotetraploid main 48 sutara hote hai evam ardhasuthran ke samay isamen 9 se 11 chatu:sanyojak or 2 se 6 tak dwisanyojak banate hai
 The diploid of Solomon lycopersicon has 12 pair chromosomes and its autotetraploid has 12 quaternary chromosomes
 ye sab paudhe hai
 The creepis rubra and araepis foetida have 5 pairs of chromosomes
 inke sutara ek duusare se bahut bhinn nahin hote or inke sankaran se utpann sankar main ardhsutran ke samay 5 dwisanyojak banate hai
 Its allopolyploid consists of 20 centrioles and in meiosis there are 0 to 5 quadruple connectives and 0 to 10 divisors
 spasht he ki elotetraploid bahut urvar nahin hoga
 Primula floribanda and Primula resticillata both have nine pair of chromosomes, which are often identical
 inke sankaran se jo sankar banaata he uske prituja kivensis kehete hai
 It also has 9 pairs of chromosomes
 ardhasuthran ke samay main yugman kriya safal hoti he or 9 dwisanyojak banate hai
 The allopolyploid formed by the diploid of the formulas has 9 quaternary formulas and in such plants 12 to 18 are divalent and 0 to 3 quadruple
 spasht he ki chatu:sanyojaakon kii sankhya bahut kam he or kabhi kabhi ek bhi chatu:sanyojak nahin banataa
 Radish and Karamkalla each have 9 pairs of chromosomes, which are completely different from each other
 inke sankaran se utpann sankar refanas brasika main bhi 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai; parantu ardhasuthran main ek hi dwisanyojak nahin banataa, kyonki yugman kii kriya safal nahin hoti or sabhi sutara ayugmit rah jate hai jisase 12 ek-sanyojak banate hai
 The allotetraploid resulting from its formula diploid consists of 12 pair formulas and the meiosis consists of 12 valence, quadrilateral none
 parinaam yah hota he ki refanas-brasika-elotetraploid bahut urvar hota he, yadhyapi refanas-brasika-dwiguneet bandhya hota he
 Polyploidy is rarely found in animals, but it is most often found in non-sterile animals
 paudhon main bahut si nai jatiyaan poliploid ke kaaran utpann hui hongi
 This is evidenced by the fact that about half of the species of angiosperms are such that the number of chromosomes of mature gametes is multiplied by the number of alleles of a related race
 gehun kii kai jatiyaan hai
 The basic zygote center number of these castes is 7
 gunasutron kii sankhya gehun kii jatiyon main 7 kii guneet 14,21,42 tathaa 49 tak pai jaati he
 Similarly, the number of chromosomes in different species of tobacco is 12 or 12 multiplied by 24
 paudhon main prayog dwaara bahut se poliploid banaae gaye hai, jinamein ekaatmak sutron ke do kulak hote hai
 They are fertile

 The cells of the renal tubule extract the urea from the blood and the liver cells converge to glucose by converting them into glycogen
 spasht he ki kisi bhi praani kii prayek koshika main uske sab jin saadhaarant: upasthit hote hai
 Therefore, at the origin of different types of proteins of different types of cells, some suitable genes must have been active and the rest have become inactive and the same thing will happen with respect to their activation
 spes vector modulan ), pulse vid modulation karne kaa elgoridm he
 It is used to make alternating current, which is mainly used to rotate three phase motors at a variable speed
 spes vector modulan kai prakaar se kiya ja saktaa he or in vibhinn prakaar ke spes vector modulan ke alag-alag gundharm hai 
 There are some basic rules to turn the inverter switches shown in the picture
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi bhi samay kisi ek stambh main sthit donon switch chaalu nahin hone chaiye yadi ham yah maanakar chalate hai ki ek hi stambh ke donon switch paraspar poorak sthiti main rahenge, arthath jab A+ chaalu hoga tab A− band hoga or jab A- chaalu hoga tab A+ band hoga
 Following this condition, a total of 8 conditions of switching of the inverter are created, named V0 to V7
