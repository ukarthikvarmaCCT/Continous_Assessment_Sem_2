 itihaas lekhan yaa itihaas-shaastra se do chizon kaa bodh hota he- itihaas ke vikaas evam kriyapaddati kaa adhyan tathaa kisi vishay ke itihaas se sambandhit ekatrit saamagree
 Historians study historiography subjectively, such as history of India, history of Japanese Empire, etc
 itihaas ke mukhya aadhaar yugavishesh or ghatnasthal ke ve avshesh hai jo kisi na kisi rup main praapt hote hai
 Due to the multifaceted pervasiveness of life, it is inauspicious to paint the past era or society with the help of self-material
 saamagree jitani hi adhik hoti jaati he usee anupaat se beete yug tathaa samaaj kii ruparekha prastut karnaa saadhy hota jaataa he
 Notwithstanding adequate means, it cannot be said that the imaginary picture will certainly be pure or true

 The history of these is formed by proper mixing

 Just as science and philosophy are manipulated, so too are the portrayals of history

 Each era raises its own questions and seeks solutions from history
 isiilie prayek yug, samaaj athwa vyakti itihaas kaa darshan apane prashnon ke drushtibinduon se karata rahata he
 Notwithstanding all this, scientific exploration and inspection of means, consideration of chronology, careful scrutiny of the needs of the situation and the flow of events, and the imperative of vigilance and moderation in extracting the results from them, is absolutely essential
 unke bina aitihaasik kalpana or kapolkalpana main koi bhed nahin rahegaa
 In the creation of history, it must be kept in mind that the picture made from it should be strongly based on certain events and circumstances
 maansik, kaalpanik athwa manamaane swaroop ko khadaa kar aitihaasik ghatnaon dwaara uske samarthan kaa praytn karnaa akshamya dosha hone ke kaaran sarvatha varjit he
 It is also necessary to remember that the creation of history is an intellectual constructive work, so the unnatural and the incomprehensible cannot be accommodated in evidence
 iske sivaa itihaas kaa dhyevishesh yathavat gyaan praapt karnaa he
 Reputation, publicity or dismantling of any particular principle or opinion or making it a means of running any kind of movement is misuse of history
 aisa karne se itihaas kaa mahatv hi nahin nasht ho jaataa, varan upkaar ke badale usase apkaar hone lagata he jiskaa parinaam antatogatva bhayaavah hota he

 kalkey se jeetne ke baad, mahishmati main amarendra bahubali ko bhavishya kaa raja or bhallaal dev ko senapati ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 Even before the coronation, Amarendra's mother Shivgami starts searching for her bride
 vah amarendra or katappa ko kahati he ki samrajya kii sthiti or iske logon ko samajhane ke liye iskaa daura karen
 Amarendra falls in love with the princess of the Kuntal kingdom and her king's sister, Devasena
 bhallaal ko pataa chal jaataa he ki amarendra ko devsena se pyaar ho gaya he
 He then tells Shivagami that he wants to marry Devasena
 shivgami ko is bare main nahin pataa hota he ki devsena se amarendra pyaar karata he, is kaaran vah uski shaadi devsena se karaane kaa vaada kar detii he
 When Sivagami sends the marriage proposal to the Kuntal state, the messenger writes the proposal as if an arrogant person wrote it
 devsena is shaadi ke prastaav ko kade shabdon ke saath manaa kar detii he
 When Sivagami gets her answer, she orders to bring Devasena captive in anger

 When he reaches Mahismati, he discovers a misunderstanding
 shivgami use singhaasana yaa devsena main se kisi ek ko chunane bolti he
 He chooses Devasena
 is kaaran bhallaal ko vahaan kaa raja bana diya jaataa he or amarendra ko senapati par phir bhi log use hi raja maanate hai
 Amarendra was discharged by Bhallal as the commander of the army for Devasena's baby shower, so that he could live with his wife
 usee samay devsena raja bhallaal ke herpher ke khilaaf bolti he or shivgami ke chup rahane par bhi sawaal uthaati he
 This causes a quarrel and the two are forced out of the palace
 vah donon baahar logon ke bich khushi se jindagi bitaane lage the, par bhallaal phir se shivgami ko bhadakaata he ki amarendra use maarna chahta he or yah bhi bolta he ki yadi usne sidhi kaarywahi kii to grih yuddh shuru ho saktaa he
 For this reason, Sivagami speaks to Kattappa, his servant, that he is in trouble and has to kill Amarendra
 shivgami ke kehane par katappa ne amarendra kii peeth par dhokhe se hamalaa kar use maar diya
 Then Katappa comes and informs Shivgami that Amarendra Bahubali has died
 devsena bhi apane bachche mahendra bahubali ke saath vahaan aati he or use bhi is bare main pataa chalata he
 Shivagami tells the bewildered crowd outside the palace that Amarendra is dead and now his son Mahendra Bahubali will be the new king
 iske baad bhallaal or uske log milakar devsena or uske bachche ko pakad kar karawas main daalane kii koshish karte hai
 Devasena hands his child to Sivagami who manages to escape, but Devasena is unable to save himself
 use kaid kar liya jaataa he

 Atheism or Atheism or Atheism is a doctrine that does not accept the existence of any God who creates, governs and controls the world on the basis of the absence of universal evidence
 naastik log ishwar ke astitv kaa spasht pramaan na hone kaaran jhooth qaraar dete hai
 Most atheists do not believe in any deity, supernatural power, religion and soul
 hindu darshan main naastik shabd unke liye bhi prayukt hota he jo vedon ko manyata nahin dete
 Atheists believe in knowing rather than believing
 vahiin aastik kisi na kisi ishwar kii dharna ko apane dharm, sampradaay, jati, kul yaa mat ke anusaar bina kisi pramanikta ke sweekaar karata he
 Atheism calls it superstition because no two religions and beliefs have the same belief in God
 naastikta roodhiwaadee dharanaon ke aadhaar nahin balki vaastaviktaa or pramaan ke aadhaar par hi ishwar ko sweekaar karne kaa darshan he
 All the reasoning and evidence so far is insufficient to accept the authority of God for atheism
 buddha dharm maanvi mulyon tathaa aadhunik vigyaan kaa samarthak he or buddha anuyaayi kaalpanik ishwar main vishwaas nahin karte he
 Hence Albert Einstein, Dr
 B
 R
 Many scientific and talented people like Ambedkar, Bernat Russell consider Buddhism as a scientific religion
 china desh kii aabaadi main 91% se bhi adhik log buddha dharm ke anuyaayi he, isliye duniya ke sabase adhik naastik log china main he
 Atheists can also be associated with religion
 darshan kaa anishvarwad ke anusaar jagat swayan sanchalit or swayan shasit he
 The atheists criticize all of them by giving proof for the existence of God, and try to prove that the creator of such a world cannot be a God by following the following types of arguments explaining the worldly faults
 ishwarwadi kehete he ki manushya ke man main ishvarpratyay janm se hi he or vah swayansiddh evam anivaary he
 It signifies the existence of God
 iske uttar main anishvaravaadi kehete hai ki ishvarbhaavana sabhi manushyon main anivaary rup se nahin pai jaati or yadi pai bhi jaati ho to keval man kii bhaavana se bahari vastuon kaa astitv siddh nahin hota
 Many concepts of mind have been proved imperfect by science
 jagat main sabhi vastuon kaa kaaran hota he
 There is no work without reason
 kaaran do prakaar ke hote hai-ek upadan, jiske dwaara koi vastu banati he or doosraa nimitt, jo usko banaata he
 The theologians say that the whole world is also a work like a clock, a board and a clock, and so should be the cause of gratitude and purpose
 kuch log ishwar ko jagat kaa nimitt kaaran or kuch log nimitt or upadan donon hi kaaran maanate hai
 In response to this tactic, the atheist says that we have no proof that the entire world, like ghat, pat and clock, was also generated and started at some time
 iskaa pravaah anadi he, at: iske srashta or upadan kaaran ko foundne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 If the creator of the world is accepted as a God who will face many difficulties; As such, what was the purpose in creating it? How can physical creation only do mental or spiritual power? If its substance is accepted as a physical substance, then how can it control it? He himself works with the help of physical body or equipment or without his help? Where did those tools and that physical body come from without creation? What is the purpose of God by creating such a creation, which his devotees consider to be omnipotent, omniscient and benevolent, in which the end of life is in death, the end of happiness, in sadness, in dissociation, and in decadence of progress? What is the benefit of creating this sad world, where the organism lives by eating the organism, and where all the beings are enemies to each other and all the beings struggle among themselves? The plight of this world is well described in one verse of Yogavashistha, sirf isliye ki vigyaan prayog main, samajha nahin saktaa jaise pyaar jo kavita likhane ke liye kavi ko prerit karata he, iskaa arth yah nahin he ki dharm kar saktaa he
 It is a simple and logical fallacy to say that, 'if science cannot do something, religion can
 -richard dockins' Theologians offer a strategy that in this material world, under all things and in all creation, rules and purpose are found meaningful
 yah baat isaki dyotak he ki iskaa sanchaalan karanevaala koi budhimaan ishwar he is yukti kaa anishvarwad is prakaar khandan karata he ki sansar main bahut si ghatnaayen aisi bhi hoti hai jinka koi uddeshy, athwa kalyankari uddeshy nahin jaan padataa, yatha ativrishti, anaavrishti, akaal, baadh, aag lag janaa, akalmrityu, jaraa, vyaadhiyaan or bahut se hinsak or dusht praani
 The more rules and unity visible in the world, the more irregularity and opposition can be seen
 inkaa kaaran foondnaa utana hi aavashyak he jitna niyamon or aikya kaa
 Just as a king or state administration controls all people in society in behavior towards one another, similarly there is a need for a God who rules over all creatures of the world and to torture, punish and reward them for sin and virtue
 iske uttar main anishvaravaadi yah kahata he ki sansar main prakritik niyamon ke atirikt or koi niyam nahin dikhaai padate
 The distinction between sin and virtue is false which man has made out of his mind
 yahan par sab kriyaaon kii pratikriyaayein hoti rahati hai or sab kaamon kaa lekha baraabar ho jaataa he
 No other regulator and ruler is required for this
 yadi paap or punya ke liye dand or puraskaar kaa prabandh hota tathaa unako rokane or karaanevaala koi ishwar hota; or puneatmaon kii raksha hua karti tathaa papatmaon ko dand mila karata to isamsih or gandhi jaise puneatmaon kii nrushans hatya na ho paati
 In this way, atheism denies theistic axioms and even says that if one is to be the creator of such a world, then only the wicked and foolish devil will have to be believed, not the wise and benevolent God
 paashchaatya darshanikon main anek anishvaravaadi ho gaye hai or hai
 Jain, Buddhist, Charvak, Sankhya and Purvimamsa philosophies are atheistic philosophies in India
 in darshanon main di gai yuktiyon kaa sundar sankalan haribhadra suri likhit shaddarshan samucchy ke upar gunratn ke likhe hue bhashya, kumaril bhatta ke shlokavarthik or ramanujacharya ke brahmasutra par likhe gaye shribhashya main paaya jaataa he
 Religion does the work of dividing man
 atah ishwar sirf janata kaa opium hota he
 The word atheist is used in Indian philosophy in three meanings
 jo log veda ko param pramaan nahin maanate ve naastik kehalaate hai
 According to this definition, the followers of Buddhist, Jain and Lokayat schools are called atheists and these three philosophies do not believe in God or Vedas, hence they are called atheist philosophies
 jo log paralok or mrityupashchaat jivan main vishwaas nahin karte; is paribhaasha ke anusaar keval charvak darshan jise lokayat darshan bhi kehete hai, bharat main naastik darshan kehalaata he or uske anuyaayi naastik kehalaate hai
 Those who do not believe in the existence of God
 ishwar main vishwaas na karanevaale naastik kai prakaar ke hote hai
 Extreme atheists are those who do not believe in any form of God
 charvak matvaale bharat main or rank athist log paashchaatya deshen main ishwar kaa astitv kisi rup main sweekaar nahin karte; ardhanasti unka kah sakate hai jo ishwar kaa sristi, paalan or sanhaarkarta ke rup main nahin maanate
 According to this definition, many philosophies of India fall under the category of atheists
 vastav main nyaay or vedant darshanon ko chhodkar bharat ke anya darshan sankhya, yoga, vaisheshik, buddha or jain naastik darshan kahe ja sakate hai kyonki inamen ishwar ko sarjak, paalak or vinaashak nahin mana gaya he
 Only such atheists are called atheists

 Nevertheless, the term relativity or relativity is sometimes used to refer to Galilean invariance
 theory off relativity naamak is shabd kaa prayog sabase pehle san 1906 main maiks plank ne kiya tha
 It was derived from the English term group "relative Theory" which describes how this theory uses the Principles of Relativity
 isi paper ke charchaa sambhag main alfred bukarar ne pratham baar "theory of relativity" kaa prayog kiya tha
 The relativity principle is in essence that the existence of 'absolute' speed and 'absolute' acceleration is impossible, that is, the terms 'absolute speed' and 'absolute acceleration' are virtually meaningless
 yadi 'nirpeksh gati' kaa arth hota to vah anya pindo kii charchaa kiye bina hi nishchit ho sakati
 But even after trying all the ways, the 'absolute' motion of a body has not been definitively proved by experiment and now the theory of relativity suggests that it is impossible to determine it
 aapekshikta siddhant se bhautikee main ek nae drushtikon kaa prarambh hua
 With the advent of relativity theory, some old theories of physics were firmly fixed and there was a need to think more closely about many fundamental imaginations
 vigyaan main siddhant kaa kaary praaia: gyaat falon ko vyavasthit rup se sutrit karnaa hota he or uske baad us siddhant se nae falon kaa anumaan karke prayog dwaara un falon kii pariksha kii jaati he
 Relativity theory has been successful in both these works
 19veen shatabdi ke ant tak bhautikee kaa vikaas newton pranit siddhanton ke anusaar ho rahaa tha
 Every new invention or experimental fruit was seen from the point of view of these principles and necessary new hypotheses were made
 inamen sarvyaapee ether kaa ek vishisht sthaan tha
 There were two major reasons for imagining the existence of ether
 pratham to vidyutchumbakeey tarangon ke kampan kaa ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak prasaran hone ke liye ether jaise madhyam kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Second, Newton's kinetic equations in mechanics, and also the background on which these equations were based, required an authentic director
 prayogon ke falon kaa yatharth akalan hone ke liye ether par vishisht gundharmon kaa aropan kiya jaataa tha
 Ether was considered ubiquitous and believed to exist in all directions and bodies
 is sthir ether main pind bina pratirodh ke bhraman kar sakate hai, aisi kalpana thi
 Due to these properties, there was no obstacle in understanding ether as an absolute standard
 prakaash kii gati 3x108 me
 prati second he, yah gyaat hua tha or prakaash kii tarangen 'sthir' ether ke saapeksh is gati se vikirit hoti hai, aisi kalpana thi
 In mechanics, ether was also considered an absolute standard for velocity, acceleration, force, etc
 19veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main ether kaa astitv tathaa uske gundharm sthapit karne ke anek praytn prayog dwaara kiye gaye
 Among them, the use of Michelson Morley is particularly important and notable
 prithvi, surya kii parikrama ether ke saapeksh jis gati se karti he us gati kaa yatharth maapan karnaa is prayog kaa uddeshy tha
 But this attempt was unsuccessful and from the result of the experiment it was estimated that the speed of the earth with respect to ether is zero
 iskaa yah bhi arth hua ki ether kii kalpana asaty he, arthath ether kaa astitv hi nahin he
 If there is no ether then even absolute standards cannot exist
 at: gati keval saapeksh hi ho sakati he
 In physics, work is usually done by directing any one method to measure the speed or to express the result
 kintu in nirdeshak paddatiyon main koi bhi paddati 'vishistaaapurna' nahin ho sakati, kyonki yadi aisa hota to us 'vishistaaapurna' nirdeshak paddati ko ham vishranti kaa maanak samaj sakate
 a similar result was obtained from many experiments
 in prayogon ke falon se keval bhautikee main hi nahin, balki vigyaan tathaa darshan main bhi gambhir ashaanti utpann hui
 In the early 20th century, the famous French mathematician H
 Poincaré presented the rule of relativity
 inke anusaar bhautikee ke niyam aise swaroop main vyakt hone chahie ki ve kisi bhi prekshak ke liye vaastavik hon
 This means that the laws of physics should not be observable above the speed of the observer
 is pranium se dik tathaa kaal kii prachlit dharanaon par nayaa prakaash padaa
 Einstein's ideology on this subject, though revolutionary, was more successful in explaining the fruits of experiments
 oinstin ne gati, twaran, dik, kaal ityadi moulik shabdon kaa or unase sanyukt prachlit dharanaon kaa vishesh vishleshan kiya
 From this analysis, it became clear that there are errors in physics based and distinguished by Newton's theories
 oinstin pranit aapekshikta siddhant ke do vibhaag hai : In specific relativity theory the laws of physics are expressed in the form that they will be the same for any observant observer
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is prakaar vyakt hote hai ki ve prekshak kii gati se swatantra yaa abaadhit honge
 The specific relativity theory developed in 1905 and the general relational theory developed in 1915
 iskaa pratipaadan san 1905 main oinstin ne apane ek shodhpatr on da electrodinemics off mowing bodies main kii thi
 Specific relativity is based on two hypotheses that contradict the concepts of classical mechanics: vishisht aapekshikta ke siddhanth se nikalne vaale parinaam ascharyajanak hai; inamen se kuch is prakaar hai: In classical mechanics Galileo's transformation is used while Lorents transformation in specific relativity
 san 1907 se 1911 ke bich ainstin dwaara viksit aapekshikta siddhanth hi 'saamaanya aapekshikta' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 This theory is based on the following two hypotheses: lambaai, dik, kaal, dravyaman, urja ityadi ke vishay main bhotiki main jo dharanaayen thim unamem vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ne sudhaar kiya
 Apart from these, there are other subjects in the field of physics which are equally important, but their inclusion is not in the specific relativity theory
 bal tathaa vidyutchumbakeey kshetron main vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa jaisaa upyog ho saktaa he vaisaa gurutveey kshetra main nahin ho saktaa
 Gravity is an extremely important department of physics, so it is clear that there is a need to broaden the specific relativity theory
 dravyaman kaa sambandh bhautikee main do prakaar se aata he
 When a force acts on a body, the body's position changes and its velocity changes
 jab tak bal kaary karata he tab tak pind ko twaran miltaa he
 According to the laws of mechanics the force, mass and acceleration of the body have the following relation: is sameekaran main jo dravyaman m he usko jadtv yaa ashrith dravyaman kehete hai
 The second relation of mass comes under the gravitational field of Newton
 newton dwaara diye gayi gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke anusaar yadi do dravyaman, m1 tathaa m2, duuri r par hon, to unke bich main nimnlikhit gurutvkarshneey bal f kaam karegaa : g is the gravitational constant in this equation
 yadi ham m1 ko prithvi kaa dravyaman samajhen or m2 ko dharti ke paas sthit kisi anya pind kaa dravyaman samajhen to sameekaran dravyaman m2 kaa bhaar vyakt karegaa
 In Newton's mechanics, kinetics and gravity are independent and different, but both have a relationship of mass
 dravyaman ke in do swatantra tathaa bhinn vibhaagon main prayukt kalpanaaon kaa ekikaran oinstin ne apane saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main kiya
 It was known that inertial mass and gravitational mass are the same
 oinstin ne dravyaman kii is samanta kaa upyog karke gativigyaan or gurutvkarshan ko ekarup kiya or san 1915 i
 main vyapak aapekshikta siddhant prastut kiya
 The method of formulating general relativity theory in mathematics is different from other methods
 isamen vishesh jyamiti kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jo euclid kii tri-aiami jyamiti se bhinn he
 ] Stated that in the specific relativity theory, if the three dimensions of difficulty and the fourth dimension of time, a 'chatrayayam Satti' with these four dimensions, is imagined, then the theory of relativity becomes much simpler
 samakshanikta, nirpeksh nahin he - yah pramanit kiya ja chukaa he
 This eliminates the Newton-posed problem and the absolute and freedom of time
 at: bhautik ghatana vyakt karne ke liye dik tathaa samay kii chaturaayam satati adhik swaabhaavik he
 Einstein made more use of what Reiman had developed for his geometry by imagining 'chatrayayam Dikha'
 dik tathaa samay kii is chaturaayam satati main bhautikee ke siddhant jyamitiya rup se saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main rakhe gaye
 This Chatrayayam Satti is equated with the problem of Euclid's three dimensions
 teen aayam kii satati main, in teen nirdeshaankon se jis prakaar bindu athwa ek sthaan nishchit hota he, vaise hi do bindu or ke bich kii lambaai bhi nishchit hoti he
 When time is added along these three dimensions of the problem in Chatrayayam Sati, then the dimension of time comes as t = x0
5c-1, where t = time and c = velocity of light
 ek prekshak ke liye ek vishwaghatana ke nirdenshank hon to us prekshak ke saapeksh gatiman duusare prekshak ke liye usee ghatana ke nirdeshank honge
 If the laws of Lorenz's conversion are true then it can be proved that sameekaran kaa vikaas karke kisi bhi prakaar kii gati ke liye isi prakaar kii kintu atyadhik sanmishra padasanhtiyaan milti hai
 For this, the principles of principles and principles are required
 moulik kalpanaaon kaa is reeti se vistaar karne par vyapak aapekshikta siddhant main gurutvkarshan swabhaavat: aata he
 It does not require specific hypotheses
 anek ghatnaon ke fal, oinstin pranit vyapak aapekshikta siddhant ke anusaar tathaa newton pranit pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar, samaan hi hote hai
 But when the general relativity principle was used in astronomy, the results of the three phenomena differed somewhat from those produced according to the iconic mechanics
 in falon se saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kii kasuti kaa kaam le sakate hai
 These three fruits are as follows: 390 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year 390 BC or the year before his birth is considered as the basis of Jesus' birth
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 390 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kali Yuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc

 Infectious diseases occur from person to person and originate from microbes
 roganirodhan kii do pramukh vidhiyaan hai : If we somehow increase the amount of antibodies of a suspected pathogen in a person's blood, then the person's immunity increases
 sambhavya vyaktiyon ke sharir main pratirakshiyon kaa anumaapnaank badhaane kii do vidhiyaan hai : Appropriate antigens of pathogenic bacteria associated with the system are entered in such a way that disease does not occur but becomes an essential antibody

 kuli-begaar aandolan 1921 main uttar bharat ke bageshwar nagar main aam janata dwaara ahimsak aandolan tha
 This movement was led by Badri Dutt Pandey, and after the success of the movement he was given the title of 'kumaon Kesari'
 is aandolan kaa uddeshy kuli begaar pratha band karaane ke liye angrejon par dabaav bananaa tha
 The father of the movement, Mahatma Gandhi, called it 'bloodless revolution'

 The princes of different villages had the responsibility that they would provide a certain number of coolies to the ruling class for a fixed period
 is kaary hetu pradhan ke paas baqayada ek register bhi hota tha, jisamen sabhi gram vaasiyon ke naam likhe hote the or sabhi ko baari-baari yah kaam karne ke liye baadhya kiya jaataa tha
 Due to the connivance of the chiefs, zamindars and patwaris, and due to mutual discrimination, there was increasing dissatisfaction among the public as the village head and the patwari started promoting this evil practice in order to serve their personal interests or to hate their feelings
 is kupratha ke khilaaf log ekatrit hone lage
 Sometimes people were also forced to do extremely disgusting things
 jaise ki angrejon kii kamou yaa gande kapane aadi dhonaa
 The porters were being exploited physically and mentally by the British, people also started to unite against it
 sabase pehle chand shaskaon ne rajya main ghodon se sambandhit ek kar ’ghodalon‘ nirupati kiya tha, sambhavtah kuli begaar pratha kaa yah ek praarambhik rup tha
 Later this practice took wide form in the rule of Gurkhas, but the British ended it in their early period
 par dhire-dhire angrejon ne na keval is vyavastha ko punah lagu kiya parantu ise iske damkaari rup tak pahunchaaya
 Earlier this tax was levied not on the general public but on the goodsguards who collected taxes from the landlords or landlords
 atah dekha jaye to yah pratha un kaashtkaaron ko hi pratyaksh taur par prabhavit karti thi jo jameen kaa malikana haq rakhte the
 But on the ground of reality, the truth was that these rich landlords and landlords put their parts on potters, landless farmers, laborers and weaker sections of society who accepted it as conditional remuneration
 is prakaar yah pratha yada kada virodh ke baavjood chalati rahi
 The spark of rebellion in 1857 also spread to Kumaon

 Through Almora newspaper, he started public awareness as well as protest against this evil practice
 1920 main nagpur main congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan hua, jisamen pan0 govind ballab pant, badridatt pande, har gobind pant, victor mohan joshi, shyaam laal shah aadi log sammilit huye or badri dutt pande ji ne kuli begaar aandolan ke liye mahatma gandhi se aashirwad liya or waapas aakar is kuriti ke khilaaf janajagran karne lage
 On January 14, 1921, on the occasion of Uttarayani festival, the Kuli Begar movement started, the movement was attended by the common man, the gathering of people from different villages turned it into a huge demonstration
 sarayu or gomti ke sangam ke maidan se is aandolan kaa udghosh hua
 Even before the start of this movement, the District Magistrate served notice to Pandit Hargobind Pant, Lala Chiranjilal and Badri Dutt Pandey but it did not affect them, the public first visited the temple of Bagnath and offered prayers and then 40 a procession of thousands of people started towards Saryu Bagad, there was a flag at the forefront of the procession which was written, "stop the coolie forced", after which there was a meeting in the Saryu Maidan
 Addressing the gathering, Badridatta Pandey said, “take the holy water of water and take the pledge of the Bagnath temple as a witness that from today onwards, you will not give coolies, potters, begaris and Baradis
 ” sabhi logon ne yah shapath lee or gaanvon ke pradhan apane saath kuli register lekar aaye the, shankh dhwani or bharat mata kii jai ke naaron ke bich in kuli registeron ko fadkar sangam main pravaahit kar diya
 Dybal, the then deputy commissioner of Almoda, was present in the crowd, tried to shoot at the crowd, but could not materialize as the police force was low
 is safal andolan ke baad janata ne badri dutt pande ji ko kumaun kesari kii oopaadhi di, is aandolan kaa logon ne samarthan hi nahin kiya balki kadai se paalan bhi kiya or is pratha ke virodh main logon kaa pradarshan jari rahaa
 As a result, the government abolished this practice by bringing a bill in the House
 is andolan se mahatma gandhi bahut prabhavit huye or swayan bageshwar aaye or chanaunda main gandhi ashram kii sthapana kii
 After this, Gandhiji wrote about this movement in Young India that "its effect was complete, it was a bloodless revolution

 din-i-ilahi was a homogenous religion by the Mughal emperor Akbar in 1582 AD, which inserted the core elements of all religions, prominently Hindu and Islam religions
 inke alaava parsi, jain evam isai dharm ke mul vichaaron ko bhi sammalit kiya
 However, he did not do much to promote this religion, only you included the trusted people in it
 kaha jaataa hai ki akbar ke alaava keval raja birbal hi mrityu tak is ke anuyaayi the
 According to dabestan-e-mazhab, after Akbar, only 19 people adopted the s Dharma
 Later on, Akbar composed a new almanac in which he started a theocratic era which began from the day of Akbar's coronation
 usne tatkaaleen sikkon ke peeche allahu-akbar likhvaya jo anekaarthi shabd tha
 Akbar literally means "great" and the word allahu-akbar could have two meanings "allah is great" or "akbar is Allah"
 deen-i-ilaahi sahi myanon main dharm na hokar ek aachaar sahinta samaan tha
 Indulgence, pride, condemnation or blaming were forbidden and were called sins

 Akbar reached the famous pilgrimage, Kurukshetra
 vahaan suryagrahan par aaj bhi bada mela hota he
 People take bath us samay, kuch sadhu-vairaagi bhi kurukshetra ke kunda main snaan karne aae the, parantu unamem yah vivaad tha ki koun dal pehle snaan kare
 Even today, there is a fight over taking bath first
 atev jab yah vivaad tay na ho sakaa to donon dalon ne badshaah se fariyaad kii
 Both had their claims, but the king could not get any definite proof
 jaan padataa he, yuvak akbar ko kuch masakhri suujhi
 He said- Let the two fight among themselves, the party that wins will take a bath first
 is par ek dal ne fariyaad kii ki vipakshiyon ke dal main adhik vyakti hai
 Humorous Akbar said that it is okay, who has less men, he should take as many royal soldiers
 phir kya tha, kisi ne kisi kii dadhi pakadi, kisi ne kisi kii jataa
 a very funny depiction of this pride was found in the royal copy of akbar-naam
 akbar ke saath gaye chitrakaaron ne ghatana kaa chitra banaaya he
 Looking at the picture, it is known that Akbar, who was standing at a distance, was also enjoying this spectacle
 akbar ke darbar main jain bhi the, yah badayunni or abul fazal donon hi kehete hai
 Two prominent Jain sages Heer Vijayaji and his disciple Vijayasen Suri came to his court
 ye donon shwebantar jain the
 Among them, Heer Vijayji Suri received the order of Akbar in 1584 AD
 log jainon ke sammukh hinsa na karen or maance na khaaen
 Akbar must have had great reverence for Heer Vijayji
 abul fazal ne likhaa he ki ve ucchtam koti ke dharmik vyakti the
 Due to their influence, Akbar was disgusted with the violence of the creatures and on several specific dates he refused the violence of the creatures in his empire
 vah swayan maance-bhakshan ke viruddh ho gaya
 He himself took a fast to eat vegetarian food every Friday
 akbar ne yah mahasoos kiya ki sabhi dharmon kaa ek hi uddeshy he
 Therefore, he took the path of coordinating all religions i
e
 taking good things from all religions
 isi ko usne 'sulah kul' kaha
 In this way, he started din-i-ilahi with the good things of all religions
 isamen islam kaa akeshwarwadatha, to parsi dharm ke anusaar surya or agni us ishwar ke prakaash or tej ke rup main poojaneey the
 Non-violence of Hindu and Jain religions had a deep imprint on this religion

 However, it is also accepted that the policy of sulah-i-kul, which had the essence of din-i-ilahi, was adopted by Akbar not just for religious purposes but as a part of the general imperial administrative policy

 sabhi kii dharmik manyataon par vichaar hota
 If there was any weakness in them, it would be revealed
 dharmik sahishnutaa barti jaati, isse ulti buddhi vaale or dushton ko jalan hoti
 When Akbar was freed from internal strife, he turned his attention to religious reform
 usne ek nae dharm kii sthapana kii
 In this he coordinated the Holy Quran, theology of Brahmins and the teachings of Jesus Christ
 is hetu usne ek sabha kii
 In this he called the Acharyas of all religions, as well as his mansabdars
 tha It is worth noting that fundamentalist followers of all religions opposed Akbar's liberal approach
 is par akbar ne kaha- 'kisi bhi samrajya ke antargat yah anuchit he ki janata anek dharmon main vibhajit ho
 This creates differences among themselves
 jitne dharm utane hi dal hai
 There is enmity between them and hence coordination is required in all religions
 parantu ise aise dhang se karnaa chahie ki ek hote hue bhi unki visheshta bani rahe
 With this, the goodness of all religions will remain and the characteristics of other religions will also come
