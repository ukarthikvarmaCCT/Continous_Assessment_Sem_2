 " MIS and Information Systems These words often cause confusion for each other
 soochna pranali main aisi pranaliyaan shaamil hai jo nirnay lene main madad karne se abhipret nahin hai
 In the field of study, MIS is sometimes interpreted as an information technology management in a limited sense
 adhyayan ke us kshetra ko computer vigyaan samajhane kaa bhram nahin karnaa chahie
 IT Services Management is a business-focused branch
 MIS bhi udyog sansaadhan yojana se kuch alag he kyonki ERP main aise tatv bhi shaamil hai jo aavashyak rup se nirnay lene main madad karne par kendrit nahin hai

 Organic compounds have a very important role in life
 inamen carbon ke saath-saath hydrogen bhi rahata he
 Due to historical and traditional reasons, some carbon compounds are not classified as organic compounds
 inamen carbondioxide, carbon monooxide pramukh hai
 All biomolecules such as carbohydrates, amino acids, proteins, RNA and DNA are organic compounds
 carbon or hydrogen ke yogico ko hydrocarbon kehete hai
 Methane is the hydrocarbon of the smallest molecule
 ethane, propen aadi iske baad aate hai, jinamein kramash: ek ek carbon judata jaataa he
 Hydrocarbons can be divided into three categories: ethane category, ethylene class and acetylene class
 ethane shrenee ke hydrocarbon santrupt hai, arthath inamen hydrogen kii maatra or badhaai nahin ja sakati
 Ethylene has a double bond between two carbons, in acetylene the triple bonded compounds are temporary
 ye aasaani se oxikrut evam hellojanikrut ho sakate hai
 Many derivatives of hydrocarbons can be prepared, which have diverse uses
 aise vyutpann chloride, bromide, iodide, alcohal, sodium alcoxide, amin, maracaptain, nitrate, nitrite, nitrite, hydrogen phosphate tathaa hydrogen sulphate hai
 Unsaturated hydrocarbons are more active and combine with multiple reactants to make them easily derived
 aise anek vyutpan audyogic drushti se bade mahatv ke siddh hue hai
 Many valuable solvents, plastics, anthelmintic drugs etc
 have been obtained from them
 hydrocarbonon ke oxikaran se alcodaul, ether, kitone, aldihide, vasa amla, aster aadi praapt hote hai
 Alcohol can be primary, secondary and tertiary
 inke aster drav sugandhit hote hai
 Many scented liquids can be prepared from them
 sanyojaktaayen do prakaar kii hoti hai : vaidyut sanyojaktaa or sahasanyojaktaa 
 In inorganic salts, atoms in molecules, or radicals, are often associated by electronegativity, and these molecules not only split into ions in solutions, but also in solid crystals that have their ions present in a specific state
 carbon parmaanu kii bahyatam paridhi par chaar electron hai
 It can complete its octave by taking four more electrons around itself
 ek carbon parmaanu is prakaar chaar hydrogenon se bhi sanyukt ho saktaa he, yaa chlorine ke chaar parmaanuon se

 Sometimes molecules have unsaturated valencies
 yadi do carbon parmaanuon ke bich main 4 electronon kii bhagidaari ho, to kaha jayega ki inke bich main ek dwibandh he or 6 electronon kii bhagidaari ho to kahenge ki inke bich main tribandh hai
 The monopoly is stronger than the bilateral and more powerful than the double bond
 jin yogicon main dwibandh hai, ve adhik asthaayee or adhik asantrupt hai
 Benzene, the latter is a compound of the ring
 isamen teen dwibandh bhi maane ja sakate hai, par yah vishesh rup se sthaayee he
 a bond between each of its two carbons is considered resonant, which gives the benzene ring special stability

 Architectures are important in the history of a caste when civilization, prosperity and luxury come to them in some degree and they fully express the nature of caste pride, prestige, ambition and spirituality
 pracheen kaal main vaastukala sabhi kalaon kii janani kahi jaati thi
 But with the change of instinct and participation of allied businesses, it is no longer the seal of inclusive protection

 This is as far as social and other achievements are concerned
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki vaastukala bhawanon ke alankaran ke atirikt or kuch nahin he
 This is partly true as far as historical architecture is concerned
 phir vaastukala sabhyataa kaa saanchaa bhi kahi gai he
 As far as the archaeological influence is concerned, it is fine, but with a brief look at the history of architecture, it will be clear that the earliest efforts of humans are seen as the habitat cave-habitats of the hunters, the tents of the shepherds and the huts of the peasants
 nauka-awaas or vrikshon par bani jhopadiyaan purakalin vishistataaen hai
 The earliest attempts to build a religious monument were in the form of stone and wooden fences

 In the rapid development of the ages, architecture evolved, molded and conformed to the changing needs of humans - its security, work, religion, pleasure and other epoch-making symbols
 misr ke sade swaroop, china ke maanak abhikalp-swaroop, bharat ke videshi tathaa samrudh swaroop, mexico ke may or astek kii angadh mahima, yunaan ke atyant viksit devaytan, roman samrajya kii bahuvidh aavashyaktaaon kii purti karanevaale jatil prakaar ke bhawan, purakalin aadambaraheen giraje, mahan gothic girizaa bhawan or chitropam durg, turki imaaraton ke utkrisht vinyas evam anupaat or europea punarutthan ke bhavy vaastukiy smarak aitihaasik vaastu ke satat vikaas kaa lekha prastut karte hai
 All these buildings point to great epochs of human development, in which architecture is highly related to the ethnic life, reflecting the talent and ambition of the castes who have a clear imprint on their monuments
 prayek aitihaasik vaastu kii uplabdhiyaan mote taur se do moolbhoot siddhanton se nishchit kii ja sakati hai, ek jo sankalpana main antarnihit he or doosraa jo sarvocch vishistataa kaa dyotak he
 In Egyptian Vastu it is the mystification expressed by huge and massive monuments, in Assyrian, Babylonian and Iranian art, it was armament and luxurious life, in Greek art it was decidedly planned and modified vision which resulted in simplicity and refined perfection
 romanon main yah bhavyata, anand evam shakti kaa prem tha jiske falswaroop vilakshan vaigyanik nirmaan hua

 buddha or hindu vaastukala kaa utkrisht gun uskaa aadhyatmik tatv he, ja uske vikaas main adyopant pratyaksh he
 His dominance over unimaginable wealth, wealth and vast plots in Muslim architecture reflects; Whereas the great Afghani Vastu of India reveals the aggressive tendency of that regime; But the Mughal monuments are excellent in showing the excellent proportions of the Mughals and the love of work and express their life in the warmth of India
 is prakaar bhootkaaleen kritiyon main ham dekhte hai ki chattanon, iton or pattharon main moort ve vichaar hi hai jo uparyukt or vishwasaneey dhang se kisi na kisi rup main gaurav ke shikhar par pahaunchi hui sabhyaataaon kii tatkaleen dharm sambandhi yaa anya jagriti vyakt karte hai
 Over the years, architectural topical consciousness developed in harmony with the environment and local background
 aaj bhi ham pratibhavan vyaktiyon ke liye sarvaadhik upyukt swaroop tatolte rahete hai
 Today, there are some people who are satisfied to follow the ghost, there are others who try to emulate the foreign way
 bahut thode se aise hai jo apane samay, gati or rashtriya drushtikaan ke anuroop vaastu kaa vikaas karte kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 The effort of this small class is to present a new impact, which inspires the human to think and hold new ideas
 is prakaar se hamaare yug ke bhawan nirmaan karne kaa prayaas karte hai or baad main ye hi bhawan sharir or mastishk ke swasth vikaas ko protsaahat karke jati kaa nirmaan karenge
 Additionally, we see that architecture sometimes transcends known utility requirements and its construction methods
 vaastukala main hi kalpana kii vishuddh sristi, jab saare drushtikon ke vyapak avrodh ke saath vyakt hoti he, tab purnataa ke shikhar par pahunchne main samarth hoti hai, jaise yunaan main zeus ke sir se ethina kii, yaa bharat main swayambhu kii upama
 There is no doubt that buildings are the basis of architecture, but apart from erecting these buildings there is something else like poetry prose is something other than composition
 mithe swar main gaae jane par kavita prabhaavshaalee hoti hi he, kintu jab uske saath upyukt sangeet or layayukt nrity cheshtaayen bhi hoti hai tab vah keval manushya ke hriday kii or vibhinn indriyon ko hi aakarshith nahin karti apitu inke gauravpurn mail se nirmit saare vaataavaran se hi use avgat karaati he
 Likewise, archetypes are replete with philosophical activities, poetic expressions and inclusive lyrical, musical and descriptive meanings, and such exquisite artefacts deserve to be admired by the human in all respects and then gain worldwide fame
 sarvasammat mahan vaastukritiyon kii yah prashasti chirsthayee hoti he or bhavi pidiyon ko prerana detii he
 It is true that there has been a lot of instability in the use of architecture, revealing numberless styles
 kintu un shaileyon se kisi vaastu ko kya prayojan? yaa unka uske yug se kya sambandh? sach to yah he ki vaastukala na koi panth he na style, varan yah to vikaas kaa atoot kram he
 So the object has no special purpose to the styles, such as the changing fashion has no relation to a woman's dress
 is vishay main frankllid rhite ne kaha he ki vaastukala kii paridhi idhar udhar hatati rahati he, uskaa centre nahin badalata
 In the more broad sense of modern architecture, architecture has developed as a result of the search for and struggle for beauty in the presence of restrictions presented by the structural requirements of the configuration and the aesthetic possibilities of the available materials
 jab inke falswaroop kisi rachana kii sristi hoti he, tab aisa lagata he ki aaj kii vaastukala baari rachanaaon or aavritiyon ke rup main vyakt murtikla hi he
 If seen in this context, architecture should be a complete and well-developed creation of one's own initiating mind, which reaches a higher level of self

 According to Plaskett, spectroscopy is one of the many weapons kept in a large arsenal for physicists
 khagol bhautikavid ke liye akashiya pindon ke parimandal kii bhautik avasthaaon ke adhyayan kaa yah ekmaatr saadhan he
 In 1675, Newton first discovered the combined nature of white light
 iske sau varsh se kuch adhik samay ke pashchaat 1802 i
 main vuleston ne pradarshit kiya ki saura spectrum main kaali rekhaayen hoti hai
 He saw a narrow beam of sunlight through a hole in a dark chamber by prism
 unhone dekha ki yah kiranpunj kaali rekhaon dwaara chaar rangon main vibhakt ho gai
 It is also seen that when looking at the blue light at the bottom of a candle flame with a prism, many bright reflections are seen, one of which coincides with the black line between the blue and violet colors of the spectrum
 baad main 1814 i
 main frounhophar ne kaali rekhaon kii doordarshee or sankeern rekhachhidr se vistrut pariksha kii or ve spectrum main 574 tak kaali rekhaon ko gin sake the
 He named some of the major lines A, a, B, C, D, E, b etc
 which are still prevalent today
 unhone yah bhi dekha ki saura spectrum kii q rekhaayen deepak kii jwaala ke spectrum main dikhaai padanevaali kaali rekhaon kii sampati hoti hai
 The significance of this property remained unknown until Kirchhoff made it clear in 1859 AD, by a simple experiment, that the presence of d lines in the spectrum was due to the weakness of the intensity at their wavelength, which caused the folding of sodium vapor in the Sun
 Presence and this proved the presence of sodium in the Sun
 is mahatvapurn suzav kaa upyog higginge ne kichof kii khojon ko taarakeey spectrum ke adhyayan main prayukt kar kiya
 At about the same time, in Rome, Seiki began to look at the stellar spectrum, and it soon became clear that the stars were also made of the same material as the Sun
 kirkhhof, haginj or seki ke praarambhik kaary ke baad yag, jansen, locoyar, phogel or inke pashchaat dislandris pickring, killer, dunar, hell belopolski or anya logon ne is disha main kaary kiya
 In 1873, Lockyer first demonstrated that an element depends on the stimulus used over atoms emitting more than one specific spectrum
 jab locoyar ne spectrum ko uttejit karne ke liye arq ke baad adhik ugr sphuling vidhi kaa prayog kiya tab jo spectrum rekhaayen or teevr ho gai unhen unhone vardhit rekhaon kaa naam diya
 He was the first to demonstrate that the spectrum of the Sun's sphere is different from the spectrum of the sphere and the sun's sphere, and concluded that the temperature of the sphere is lower than that of the lighthouse and the temperature of the sun's spheroid is lower
 locoyar ne yah gyaat kiya ki yogicon ke jwaala spectrum main pattiyon anukram dikhaai padataa he
 These strips differ from the linear spectrum obtained by the constituent atoms
 parantu jab taap badha diya gaya, tab pattiyaan lupt ho gayi or ghatak tatwon ke rekhil spectrum prakat ho gaye
 From this observation, Lockyer argued that the enhanced lines of elements in the sphincter spectrum are due to the protoellement derived from the separation of ordinary elements
 is prakaar aaj kii gyaat pinkaring shrenee jo ynit helium parmaanu ke kaaran he use proto hydrogen spectrum kaha gaya
 Today we know that these prototype elements are the only elements whose particles have ionized
 locoyar ne anek taron kaa prekshan kiya or yah nishkarsh nikaala ki ve vibhinn prakaar ke spectrum keval isliye pradarshit karte hai ki unka taap vibhinn he
 This prudent suggestion remained neglected until 1921, until Saha correctly explained the spectrum sequence
 inke anusaar taron kii bhinnata kaa kaaran unki aantarik rasaynic rachana nahin he apitu unke taap or dabaav kii bhinnata he
 a fairly satisfactory qualitative theory about stellar circles was formulated based on Young's ideas around 1900 AD
 is siddhant ke anusaar parimandal kaa nimnatam str ek apaardarshee prakashmandal he jisamen gasiy madhyam main sanghanit dhaatu yaa carbon vaashp tairte rahete hai
 Observed child spectrum originates from this level
 is str ke upar apekshaakrit thandha parimandal rahata he jo varanatmak avasorana dwaara prekshit kaali rekhaayen utpann karata he
 In the last decade of the 19th century, a detailed qualitative analysis of the stars, especially the Sun's circle, was carried out
 anek anveshakon, mukhyarup se rolland, ne spectrum rekhaon kii pahchaan tarangadairghy ke sambandh ke aadhaar par karne kaa prayaas kiya
 The surface of the sun, the changing scene of the sun spots, the solar flame were studied

 Many new problems, such as the identification of the Kirit lines, have arisen
 grahon ke adhyayan ke liye spectrumiki kaa upyog bhi kiya gaya, yadhyapi koi mahatvapurn parinaam nahin praapt hua
 By 1900 AD, the spectral pairings (stars that appear to be single in view but are actually pair stars, and which sometimes produce recurring dipoles in the spectrum lines)
 vibhinn vedhashalaon main anek spectrumlekhi kaary main laae gaye or anek anveshakon dwaara, visheshat: link vedhashala main campbell dwaara, trijya veg kaa spectrumi maapan prarambh hue
 It can be said that this concludes the first phase of astronomical spectroscopy
 19veen shatabdi kii khagolbhautikee taarakeey spectrum kii gunatmak vyakhya tak hi simit thi
 Quantitative interpretation began in the twentieth century
 1900 i

 It can be said that the second phase of astronomical spectrometry started with these investigations
 shuster ne san 1902 main khagolbhautikee jarnal main ek lekh prakashit kiya jisamen unhone saura mandalak ke chor kii ore ke prekshit andheron ko vikarit parimandal dwaara samajhane kaa prayaas kiya
 a few years later he published a second essay, in which he attempted to explain absorption and emission lines in stellar spectrums, following these discoveries by Schwart's Child, Milan, Eddington, Fowler, and after him by Unsold, Chandrasekhar, Stamgren and others
 Worked in this direction
 surya prithvi ke sabase nikat kaa or sabase adhik chamkila tara he, jo prekshniya mandalak pradarshit karata he
 It is but natural that the continuous spectrum theory of stars be investigated by its application over the Sun
 surya mandalak ke upar kii tivrata vitaran kaa prekshan samaklit prakaash main hi nahin varan alag alag tarangadairghy ke ekvarni prakaash main bhi kiya gaya he
 It was found that the intensity decreases upon reaching the organ, and the phenomenon of confinement is more pronounced at short wavelengths than at long wavelengths
 shuster ne is prekshit angatmisran kii vyakhya karte samay yah maan liya tha ki prakashmandal sabhi dishaao main samaan rup se vikiran karata he or uske chaaron ore kaa gasiy parimandal sabhi aavritiyon par uskaa avasorana or utsarjan karata he
 Assuming that the gaseous circle is colder than the lower photosphere, Schuster proposed a theoretical rule and compared this theory to observations
 taarakeey parimandal main vikirnatmak santulan kii mahatta ko samajhane kaa shrey shwarts child ko he jo yah dikhaane main safal rahe ki prekshanon ke saath ruddhoshm santulan kii apeksha vikirnatmak santulan kaa adhik talmail baithta he
 According to this idea, energy is absorbed from the interior by radiation from one level to another
 santulan ke liye parimandal main ek nishchit taap vitaran aavashyak he
 If we estimate that the temperature increases inward, then the phenomenon of confinement can be understood very easily
 jaise jaise ham mandalak centre se ang kii ore agrasar hote hai, drushtirekha sataha ke us bindu par adhikadhik jhuk jaati he jahaan vah saura parimandal main pravesh karti he
 As a result, the average depth of the contributing level decreases in the emitted intensity
 chunki taap bheetar kii ore badhata he at: agatamisran utpann ho jaataa he
 Schwartschalild's ideas greatly helped to understand the basic problems, but they remained unclear until Bore's atomic theory was developed and understood the process of continuous absorption and emission
 is siddhant ke anusaar santat avasorana tabhi hota he jab ki baddh electron prakaashik ynan dwaara mukt hota or santat utsarjan tabhi hota he jab mukt electron kaa grahan aayan dwaara hota he
 Explorations of the Schwarts Child continued in the context of the development of atomic theory
 1920 i
 main lundbland ne ne yah siddh kiya ki shwart sachild kii kalpanaayen, jaise avasorana guna tarangadairghy se swatantra he tathaa prakirnan naganya he, bahut had tak thik hai
 Based on these imagery, the distribution of intensity in the derived spectral spectrum matches well with observations
 shwartschild kii kalpanaaon ke aadhaar par hi kaary kar miln dwaara aage vikaas kiya gaya or swatantra rup se ve unheen parinaamon par pahunche jin par landblad pahunche the
 Milan expanded the theory of the spectral spectrum to synchronous scattering and absorption by an exploration, which he published in 1923 AD
 santat spectrum ke siddhant main bani kalpanaaon kii sarthakata kii jaanch tak hi bhavi shodh simit tha
 These fantasies were: parimandal samtal samaantar he, It is in radiative equilibrium, utsarjan gunank prayek sthaan par kirkhhafr plank ke sambandh dwaara vyakt kiya gaya he arthath In = Kn Bn, tathaa The absorption coefficient is independent of frequency, except only in situations where the intensity distribution is affected by curvature
 pehali kalpana kii vaidhata anek sthitiyon main sahi siddh hui, duusari kalpana ke sambandh main yah dekha gaya ki yadi sanvahan dwaara urja abhigaman naganya na ho to sambhavit vichlan ho sakate hai
 Unsold has detected a convective region in the Sun
 naveenatam khojon se pataa lagata he ki vikirnatmak santulan kaa sabase upree str ke prekshan se jo virodhabhas he, vah sauratal ke daanedaar hon ke karan he
 The third hypothesis would be valid, at least in the deeper levels, where it can be assumed that the thermodynamic equilibrium exists
 chauthe anumaan kii vaidhata kaa pareekshan karne ke liye makriya, bearaman,, ansald,, penicock or anya logon dwaara avasorana gunank ke vistrut pariklan kiye gaye
 These people used the chemical organization of the Sun as determined by Russell in his calculations
 in pariklanon kaa upyog vibhinn prabhavi tapon par tivrata vitaran ke vakr bane ke liye kiya gaya or anek vaigyanikon ne surya or taron ke satat spectrumon ke prekshanon se inaki tulana kii
 This comparison revealed that optical ionization of atomic hydrogen participates predominantly in thermal stars, while there must be another source of continuous absorption for the Sun and other similar stars
 1939 i
 main wildt ne yah gyaat kiya ki saura kism ke taron main santat avasorana kaa kaaran rinatmak hydrogen ho sakate hai jinamein ek proton or do electron rahete hai
 The stability of the configuration of these ions was established early
 yah sheeghra hi maaloom ho gaya ki santat avasorana ke strot ke rup main rinatmak hydrogen aayan kii mahatta 10,000 degree ke neeche bad jaati he or 6,000 degree par yah prabal ho jaati he
 Chandrashekhar's discoveries on the one hand and the discoveries of Charlang and Kurgenoff on the other hand have shown that observations of confinement of the solar system are exceptionally consistent with theoretical results if absorption due to negative hydrogen ion is taken into account
 yadhyapi yah kaha ja saktaa he ki taron ke santat spectrumon ke bare main hamen paryaapt jaankaree ho gai he, tathaapi abhi bahut si samasyaon kaa hal nahin mila he, udaahranarth, surya kaa 4000 ri degree ke neeche kaa santat avasorana kaa strot abhi bhi agyaat he
 Many theories have been presented in this regard, but none are satisfactory
 apekshaakrit thande taron main anvik yogic prachur maatra main paae jate hai or unka santat avasorana abhi bhi agyaat he
 bum-wittens recently presented a table of coefficients of child absorption of stellar materials with chemical composition estimated for temperatures from 3840 à¥  degrees to 1,00,800 à¥  degrees

 The discontinuity in the spectrum of some hot stars at 500 angstroms and the continuous spectrums of the supergiant stars is still not fully understood
 phir bhi ham yah kah sakate hai ki is shatee ke purvardh main taron ke santat spectrum sambandhi gyaan main hui pragati paryaapt santoshjanak rahi he
 Absorption Lines in Stellar Spectrums - Initial ideas about the composition of absorption lines in stellar spectrums were very simple
 prakashmandal ko ghere hue thandha gasiy mandal, prakashmandal se santat utsarjit honevaale vikiran kaa varanatmak avasorana karata he jisase avasorana rekhaayen banati hai
 Schuster first introduced the ordered theory of absorption lines in stellar spectrums
 inhone in rekhaon ke banane kaa kaaran santat prakirnan par aropit spectrum rekhaon ke avasorana ko bataaya
 Schuster made some calculations for the lack of intensity in these lines and when comparing them to observations it was found that Schuster's method was correct from the idea of synchronous absorption and scattering
 shuster ne prakashmandal ke chaaron ore shuddh prakeern parimandal kii kalpana kii
 After Schuster, Schwart Sachield worked in this direction
 inhone vikirnatmak santulan ke aadhaar par spectrum rekhaon main utsarjan falnon ko gyaat kiya or saura mandalak main anek binduon par bani saura avasorana rekhaon ke prekshanon se unki tulana kii
 They found that scattering is an important factor in the formation of absorption lines, because their observations cannot be explained by a pure absorbing circle
 aadhunik khagoleey spectrumiki ko prarambh karne kaa shrey ansald ko he, jinhone surya mandalak ke upar pai janevaali sodium rekhaon kii parichchhedika k vishesh rup se kii gai prakashmapiya maapon ko shwartschild dwaara viksit vikirnatmak antaran ke siddhant or rekhiy avasorana ke kwantum siddhaat se sambandh sthapit karne kaa prayaas kiya or usne saura parimandal kii electron daab tathaa kam se kam ansh: rasinic sanghatan kaa pataa lagaaya
 After Unsold's writings, rapid progress was made in this direction
 1929 i
 main edington ne avasorana rekhaon ke nirmaan par ek niabandh prakashit kiya jisamen taarakeey avasorana rekhaon ke banane kii vidhi kaa spashtikaran kiya tha
 Accordingly, scattering and absorption are equally hand-to-hand in the formation of these lines
 is prakaar parimandal ke sabhi staron par prakirnan or avasorana hota he
 The reason for the formation of these lines is that absorption is very high near the line
 aagaamee varshon main edington ke siddhant kaa miln, vuli, penicock, ansald or chandrashekhar dwaara sudhaar or vistaar kiya gaya
 Thus when according to schuster-schwartschild the lines are formed in the reversal located above the photosphere, which produces the spectral spectrum, according to Milandington the ratio of the coefficient of linear absorption and the coefficient of continuous absorption remains constant at all locations and all levels Rekhail and Sant are equally capable of producing absorption
 parantu kisi rekha kii vaastavik sthiti donon charam simaaon ke bich main hoti he
 The reversal and the photosphere merge slowly into each other, and the determining factor of the photosphere is the gradual increase in opacity
 miln ne frounhophar rekhaon ke banane kii do avasthaaon par vichaar kiya
 The first idea was that the lines are formed under a local thermodynamic equilibrium or absorption process
 yahan pratyak str taap dwaara varnit kiya jaataa he or kirkhhof ke niyam kaa paalan hota he
 In this view, radiation from the center of an acute line corresponds to the highest level because the linear absorption coefficient is higher at this wavelength and the radiation only reaches from the plane
 sameep ke satatyak main vikiran kaa adhikansh apekshaakrit garam or nichle staron sa aata he
 The radiation emanating towards the ends of the Sun comes from the highest level in both continuum and lines
 iske parinamswaroop rekhaon ko chor par lupt ho janaa chahie
 In the second state, the atoms are not in any condition in the thermal equilibrium of the radiation field, but they give descriptive scattering of quanta reaching them more deeply
 is prakaar ek vishisht prakaash kwantum kaa tal tak pahunchne kaa bahut kam avasar praapt hota he
 The center of the absorption line formed by this mechanism of scattering will be black
 frounhophar kii koi rekha na to centre main kaali hoti he or na chor par adrishy
 Low central intensity resonance lines promote the mechanism of scattering, while high-level secondary lines promote absorption processes
 ansald, penika, minart, stramgraine or chandrashekhar ne siddhant ko or adhik parishkrut kiya
 His work mainly concerned the solution of the equation of transfer of linear radiation and deviation from ideal conditions
 taarakeey spectrumon main avasorana rekhaayen teevr foks karne par bhi saadharantaya chaudee or aspasht dikhaai detii hai
 The main reasons for their widening are the following: dopler prabhaav, jo parmaanuon ke asangat gatij gatiyon ke kaaran utpann hota he
 This can sometimes include disturbance expansion, due to the high level of high volume of gases in certain types of wires
 vikiran avamandan jo uttejit staron ke parimit jeevankaal ke kaaran hota he
 Collision damping Sometimes a wide line is formed as a result of a collision of some adjacent atoms, ions or electrons with the radiation atom
 yanon or electranon dwaara utpann sankhyikeey ucchavach kshetra ke kaaran hydrogen helium rekhaon par stark prabhaav hota he
 Gemine effect - Lines produced in sun rays or magnetic stars are widened or broken by magnetic fields
 rekhaon ke nirmaan kii kriyavidhi or aavashyak aankade mil jane par rekha kii samocch rekha praapt karnaa or uskaa prekshanon se tulana karnaa sambhav he
 Such a process is often painstaking, although these lines can yield valuable results
 parantu durbal rekhaon kaa spectrumlekhi se photograph len par unki ruparekha badi vikrut gyaat hoti he, kyonki rekha kii yatharth ruparekha praapt karne ke liye spectrumlekhi kii simit vibhedankshmata paryaapt nahin hoti
 Fortunately, there is another physical amount whose line is called the equivalent width and which is not affected by the limited resolution of the spectrograph
 yah shunya tivratavaali ytaakar parichchhedika kii chaudaai he jo utani hi sampurna urja kaa avasorana karti he jitani vaastavik parichchhedika
 For astronomical spectrometry, a functional relationship can be obtained between the equivalent width of a line and the number of atoms that produce the line
 is prakaar ke sambandh ko vruddhi kaa vakr kehete hai
 The equivalent width of the line can also be calculated in principle
 yadi ek graph par Log ko Log ke falan ke rup main pradarshit kiya jaae to vruddhi kaa saidhantik vakr praapt hota he jisase gyaat hota he ki kis prakaar kisi rekha kii shakti avasorana parmaanuon kii sankhya ke saath-saath badhati jaati he
 Actually, it includes Log Nf and not Log N
 yahan par f dolak kii shakti he jo parmaanu kii abhiruchi pradarshit karata he jab vah vishesh aavriti ke avasorana ke liye vivadaspad mul avasthaa main rahata he 
 All lines of an element, whether neutral or ionized, are obtained by plotting the logarithm of the width equal to the logarithm of their relative f values
 taarakeey parimandal ke aavashyak prachaalon jaise tatwon kii prachurtaa or uttejan taap gyaat karne ke liye is prakaar ke vakr kii saidhantik vakr se tulana kii jaati he
 Almost all the 50,000 or more stellar spectrums that have been studied are arranged in such a regular order in which many of their properties change slowly

 There are relatively few stars that branch from the main sequence to K; They are known as Ann and Yes
 prayek varg kaa pun: antarvibhaajan hota he jiske liye aksharon yaa 9 tak ke ankon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 More than 90% of the stars whose spectrum is known are in the class A, F, g and K
 varg shunya - isamen 30,000 angsterom se adhik prabhavi tapawale neeleshvet taare hai jinke spectrum main chamkile band paae jate hai
 These bands are due to superimposed hydrogen, ionized helium again, and re-ionized and nitrogen on a faintly dark background, such as T

 The brightness of the gray spectrum quickly diminishes in violet, such as Suryalanka, Swati
 varg em - lagbhag 3,000 angsterom taap ke ye laal taare hai
 Their spectrum is similar to the spectrum of stars, but the only difference is that they have distinct bands of titanium oxide, such as Jyestha, Ardra
 varg en - ye laal taare hai jinka taap lagbhag 3,000 angsterom hota he
 They are also called carbon stars
 santat spectrum par, jo bangnee main bahut durbal hota he, aanvik carbon ke kaaran kaale hans band adhyaropit rahete hai, jaise vaai canam, banaatiki ram, 
 Class r - The spectrum of this type of stars has bands similar to n class stars but the spectrum extends to purple

 Then if we compare the spectra of the demon and Vamana stars of nearly the same temperature, we find some differences which can be explained by the difference of the densities of the circles of stars
 daanav taron kaa parimandal viralit or vistrut hota he jabaki vaaman taron kaa parimandal halkaa or sampidit hota he
 By comparing the lines of ionized and neutral atoms of the same element in the spectra of the same heat demon and Vamana stars, we find that the lines of neutral atoms are stronger in the Vamana than the demon when the ionized atoms are stronger
 The lines prevail in the demon star
 is prakaar ek nirdisht taap ke daanav taare kaa spectrum kuch ucch taap ke vaaman taare ke lagbhag anuroop hota he
 The high temperature of the Vamana star is somewhat complemented by the low density in the circle of the demon star
