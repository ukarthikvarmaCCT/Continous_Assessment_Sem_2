 Stating the nature of the world, it is said that - arthath naam evam rup se vyaakrit, anek karta, anek bhokta se sanyukt, jisamen desh, kaal, nimitt or kriyafal bhi niyat hai
 The world whose creation cannot be imagined by the mind, the origin, the position and the rhythm of the world, it is called Brahm
 sampoorn jagat ke jeevon ko brahm ke rup main sweekaar karnaa, tathaa tark aadi ke dwaara uske siddh kar dena, aadi shankaracharya kii visheshta rahi he
 In this way, from the evaluation of Shankaracharya's personality and work, we can say that the task of tying the nation in a sutra was done by Shankaracharya
 bhartiya samskruti ke vistaar main bhi inkaa amuly yogadan rahaa he
 Adi Guru Shankaracharya was born in a village called Kaldi in Kerala
 vah apane brahman mata-pita kii ekmaatr santaan the
 His father died as a child
 shankar kii ruchi armbh se hi sanyas kii taraf thi
 At a young age, after requesting mother to leave for sannyas, he went out in search of Guru
 
 After receiving knowledge from Guru Gobind Paad of Vedanta, he traveled all over the country
 mithila ke pramukh vidwaan mandan mishra ko shastrarth main haraaya
 But Mandan was defeated by Mishra's wife Bharti
 dubaara phir rati vigyaan main paarangat hokar bharti ko parajeet kiya
 He removed the religious evils prevailing in the then India and illuminated the country with the light of Advaita Vedanta
 sanathan dharm kii raksha hetu unhone bharat main chaaron dishaao main chaar mathon kii sthapana kii tathaa shankaracharya pad kii sthapana karke us par apane chaar pramukh shishyon ko asin kiya
 Jyotirmath in the north, Shringeri in the south, Govardhan in the east and Sharda Math in the west established four dhams in the country
 32 saal kii alpaayu main pavitra kedaar nath dham main sharir tyaag diya
 Shankaracharya is known as Adi Guru with respect in the whole country
 ek sanyasi balak, jisaki aayu maatr 7 varsh thi, gurugrih ke niyamanusaar ek brahman ke ghar bhiksha maangane pahunchaa
 There was not even a grain of food in the house of that Brahmin to give alms
 brahman patni ne us balak ke haath par ek aanwala rakhaa or rote hue apni vipannataa kaa varnan kiya
 Seeing his condition, the heart of that love-pity idol child was moved
 vah atyant aart swar main maan lakshmi kaa stotra rachakar us param karunamayi se nirdhan brahman kii vipadaa harne kii prarthana karne laga
 Pleased at his request, Mahalakshmi rained gold amla in the house of that poor poor Brahmin
 jagat janani mahalakshmi ko prasann kar us brahman parivaar kii daridrata dur karne vaala, dakshin ke kaladi gram main janma vah balak tha- ‘'shankar'’, ji aage chalakar '‘jagadguru shankaracharya'’ ke naam se vikhyath hua
 Lord Shankar himself incarnated on this earth in the form of this great scholar Shaktipunj child
 inke pita shivguru nampudri ke yahan vivaah ke kai varshon baad tak jab koi santan nahin hui, tab unhone apni patni vishishtadevi ke saath putr prapti kii kaamana se dirghakaal tak chandramauli bhagwaan shankar kii kathor aradhana kii
 Finally, Lord Shankar appeared in a dream and was pleased and said, 'ask for the groom
 ’ shivguru ne apane isht guru se ek dderghaayu sarvajna putr maanga
 Lord Shankar said- 'watts, longevity son will not be omniscient and omniscient son will not have longevity
 bolo tum kaisaa putr chaahate ho?’ tab dharmapraan shastrasevi shivguru ne sarvajna putr kii yachana kii
 Lord Shiva again said - 'watts you will get an omniscient son
 main swayan putr rup main tumhaare yahan avateern hounga
 ' kuch samay ke pashchaat i
 san 686 main baishakh shukla panchami ke din madhyakaal main vishishtadevi ne param prakashrup ati sundar, divya kaantiyukt balak ko janm diya
 Devgn Brahmins reflected the chakra symbol on the forehead of the child, the eye sign on the forehead and the insignia on the wing to represent him as a Shiva avatar and named him 'shankar'
 inhen shankaracharya ji ko prativarsh baishakh shukla panchami ko shradhanjali arpit karne ke liye shri shankaracharya jayanti manaai jaati he
 At the time when Jagadguru Shankaracharya emerged, at that time Vedic religion was melting in Bharata and humanity was dying, in such a situation, Acharya Shankar appeared as Bhaskar Prakash Pillar of human religion
 maatr 32 varsh ke jivan kaal main unhone sanathan dharm ko aisi ojasvi shakti pradaan kii ki uski samast murchha dur ho gai
 Shankaracharya had attained good knowledge of Malayalam at the age of three years
 inke pita chaahate the ki ye sanskrit kaa purna gyaan praapt karen
 But due to the premature death of the father, in the infancy, Shankar's head's shadow rose from Shankar's head and the entire burden fell on Shankar ji's mother's shoulders
 lekin unki mata ne kartavya paalan main kami nahin rakhi
 paanch varsh kii avasthaa main inkaa yagyopavit sanskaar karwaakar vedon kaa adhyayan karne ke liye gurukul bhej diya gaya
 They were rich in talent from the beginning, so their guru was also very surprised by their talent
 apratim pratibha sampann shrutidhar balak shankar ne maatr 2 varsh ke samay main veda, puraana, upanishad, ramayana, mahabharat aadi granth kanthsth kar liye
 After that, after being honored with the Guru, he returned home and started serving Mother
 unki matra shakti itani vilakshan thi ki unki prarthana par alwai nadi, jo unke gaanv se bahut dur bahati thi, apana rukh badal kar kaladi gram ke nikat bahane lagi, jisase unki mata ko nadi snaan main suvidha ho gai
 After some time, his mother thought of his marriage
 par acharya shankar gruhasthi ke jhanjhat se dur rahanaa chaahate the
 An astrologer had also told by looking at the birth chart that at a young age there is the possibility of his death
 aisa jaanakar acharya shankar ke man main sanyas lekar lok-seva kii bhaavana prabal ho gai thi
 He persevered with his mother for retirement and Bal Shankar took retirement at the age of 7
 phir jivan kaa ucchtam lakshya praapt karne ke liye mata se anumati lekar ghar se nikal pade
 One day in the life of Acharya Shankara - Acharya Shankar is versed to reach him in the last moments of Matashree Aryamba's life
 'kaalah krida gachchhatyaayuʼ siddhantanusaar yah kshan udit hota he
 Acharya Shankar gets a foreshadowing from the power of yoga
 chal dete hai ve kerala ke kaalti sthit apane gram kii ore
 As soon as the village enters the border, the storm of memories completely engulfs them
 'are, yahi to alwai nadi he
 i was caught by a crocodile while bathing in it
 matashri se mere sanyas kii anugna milne par hi usne mujhe mukt kiya tha
 There was so much compulsion in his mind while giving permission
 main unka ekmaatr santan
 He is also sanyasom oriented
 vansh shrinkhalaa ke uchhinn hone kii sthiti
 Service of Ekakini Mata- Problem of Sushruva
 phir bhi unhone mujhe sanyas kii anumati di
 'acharya arrives at the door of his house thinking all these things
 acharya kii aahat paakar grihasevika darwaja kholti he 
 Acharya reaches directly to Mother Mathaiya
 sanyasi rup main putr ko dekhakar mata ke netron se ashruvindu dhalakane lagate hai
 In this sequence, the mother's death is done
 matashri ke praan apne sanyasi putr kii utkar pratiksha main hi atake the
 Here eyes see the son, and the second moment Pran gives his body the body of a body with his extraction
 acharya shankar ne sanyas kii diksha lee he, ve parivrajak ho gayi hai
 According to the scriptures, they cannot touch fire
 unke saamne ek bhayankar dharmsankat surasa kii bhaanti munh baaye khadaa ho jaataa he
 If they offer oblation to the mother goddess, then sannyasa is revered by religion
 yadi mukhaagni nahin dete to putr dharm se vimukh hote he
 For some time Acharya's ascetic mind jumped from his mind and runs away
 uske sthaan par saamaanya chitt kaa pravesh ho jaataa he
 Seeing the maternal body, he deviates like a normal human
 matashri ke haathon ko apane haath main lekar ateet main kho jate hai
 Think 'I did so much service with these hands
 aaj ye haath itane paravash ho gayi hai
 In childhood, she used to rub me in the Poorna River with these hands
 khilaate samay saathi bacchon ke saath main khilne ke liye bhaag jaataa tha
 She used to run and catch me and feed with these hands
 inhen haathon se ve pratidin menre sharir par telumardan karti thim
 When Dadashree died, Mothershree wanted to spend the rest of her life with my mind
 par menre sanyasi hone ke pashchaat ve puri tarah se tut gayin
 In my absence, he had only one task left, waiting for death
 'acharya shankar ateet se vartmaan main utarate hai
 At the same time, the housekeeper whispers in his ear, 'your Namboodri family will not participate in the funeral procession of the mother
 unke asahyog kaa kaaran yah he ki ve aapke is krity ko shaastra viruddh or parampara viruddh maanate hai
 It is said that when a sannyasi gives up his home, it is against the scripture to return to his home principal
 agni sparsh uske liye sarvatha varjit he
 We cannot support Acharya Shankar in working against such scriptures
 sevika kii baat sunakar acharya ek kshan ke liye udign ho jate hai
 They do not understand how they will go to the crematorium with the dead body of mother alone
 kuch samay ke liye ve kinkartavyavimudh ho jate hai
 Suddenly a solution flashes in his mind
 'matashri ke shav ko shmashaan ghat par na le jaakar yadi grih parisar main hi antyeshti kar di jaay to isamen kya aapatti ho sakati he
 ʼ Some such feeling comes in the mind of Acharya
 sagotri log dur se hi acharya kii dwividha kaa anand le rahe hai
 No one supports them in these moments of disaster
 antatah acharya shankar apane ghar ke saamne hi chita sajaate hai
 Somehow the body of the mother is placed on the pyre
 haath main agnishikha lekar chita kii parikrama karte hue shav ko mukhaagni dete hai
 Acharya converts the house premises into a crematorium
 chita se uthi lapaton ko dekhakar acharya ko lagata he jaise agni dev unki mata ke sookshm sharir ko lekar pitralok kii ore prayaag kar rahe hai
 Gradually the flames of the pyre calm down but the mind of the Acharya gets upset for his relatives
 sochate hai, itani baari vipattiyon me hamaare sagotriyo ne sahanubhuti kaa ek shabd bhi muh se nahin nikaala
 This mentality of Acharya Shankar leads to a curse, "now the people of this gotra will not cremate the crematorium like me, but in front of their house
 " 'mrisha na hoi dev rishi vaani' siddhanth ke anusaar kerala ke kaalti gram main namboodri brahmanon me aaj bhi shav-dah ghar ke saamne hi kiya jaataa he
 After a long trek from Kerala, he reached Omkarnath on the banks of river Narmada
 vahaan guru govindpad se yoga shiksha tathaa advait brahm gyaan praapt karne lage
 Acharya Shankar continued to practice the Advaita element for three years
 tatpashchaat guru ajna se ve kaashi vishwanath ji ke darshan ke liye nikal pade
 While he was going to Kashi, a Chandal came in his way
 unhone krodhit ho chandal ko vahaan se hat jane ke liye kaha to chandal bolaa- ‘he muni! aap shariron main rahane vaale ek paramatma kii upeksha kar rahe hai, isliye aap abrahman hai
 Therefore, move away from my path
 ’ chandal kii devvani sun acharya shankar ne ati prabhavit hokar kaha-‘aapane mujhe gyaan diya he, at: aap mere guru hue
 Saying this, when Acharya Shankar bowed down to him, he was seen by Shiva and four deities in place of Chandal
 kaashi main kuch din rahane ke dauraan ve mahishmati nagari main acharya mandan mishra se milane gaye
 The domesticated hyena that was home to Acharya Mishra also chanted Veda mantras
 mishra ji ke ghar jaakar acharya shankar ne unhen shastrarth main haraa diya
 Seeing the defeat of her husband Acharya Mishra, wife Acharya said to Shankar - 'mahatmaan! You have just won half a part
 apni yuktiyon se mujhe parajeet karke hi aap vijayi kahala sakenge
 ' tab mishra ji kii patni bharti ne kaamshaastra par prashn karne prarambh kiye
 But Acharya Shankar was a child-celibate, so where would he answer his questions related to work? On this, he asked for a few days time from Bharti Devi and entered into the body and got all the information about that subject
 iske baad acharya shankar ne bharti ko bhi shastrarth main haraa diya
 During his stay in Kashi, he defeated even more learned Pandits in a debate and became famous on the Guru's post
 anek shishyon ne unase diksha grahan kii
 After this, he started promoting religion
 vedant prachaar main sanlagn rahakar unhone anek granthon kii rachana bhi kii
 The Advaita Brahmist Acharya Shankar believed only the uninterrupted Brahman to be true and was immersed in the Brahmana
 ek baar ve brahm muhoort main apane shishyon ke saath ek ati sankri gali se snaan hetu manikarnika ghat ja rahe the
 On the way, a young woman sat mourning her dead husband's head in his lap
 acharya shankar ke shishyon ne us stri se apane pati ke shav ko hataakar rasta dene kii prarthana kii, lekin vah stri use ansuna kar rudan karti rahi
 Then Acharya himself requested him to remove the body
 unka aagrah sunakar vah stri kehane lagi- ‘he sanyasi! aap mujhase baar-baar yah shav hataane ke liye kah rahe hai
 Why don't you ask this dead body to be removed? ' Hearing this, Acharya said- 'O Goddess! You may have also forgotten in mourning that the body itself does not have the power to move away
 ’ stri ne turant uttar diya- ‘mahatman aapaki drushti main to shakti nirpeksh brahm hi jagat kaa karta he
 Then why can't this dead body be removed without power? ' Acharya sat there after hearing such a serious, knowledgeable, mysterious sentence of that woman
 unhen samadhi lag gai
 In the inner eye, he saw - everywhere Adyashakti Mahamaya Leela is mourning
 unka hriday anivarchaneey anand se bhar gaya or mukh se matra vandana kii shabdamayi dhara stotra banakar foot padi
 Now Acharya Shankar became such an ocean in which streams of monotheism, monotheism, pure virtue, specific dualism, devotion to virtuous realization with Nirguna Brahman wisdom started to shake together
 unhone anubhav kiya ki gyaan kii advait bhoomi par jo paramatma nirgun niraakaar brahm he, vahi dwait kii bhoomi par sagun saakaar he
 He considered the worship of Saguna to be the inevitable ladder to reach Nirguna by supporting both Nirguna and Saguna
 gyaan or bhakthi kii milan bhoomi par yah bhi anubhav kiya ki advait gyaan hi sabhi saadhnaaon kii param uplabdhi he
 He also proclaimed 'brahman Satyam Jaganmithya' and also composed devotional hymns of Shiva, Parvati, Ganesh, Vishnu etc
, composed the best texts like 'soundarya Lahiri', 'vivek Chudamani'
 prasthaan trayee ke bhashya bhi likhe
 With his irrefutable arguments ended the duality of shaiva-shakta-vaishnavas and paved the way for Panchdevopasana
 unhone asetu himalay sampurna bharat kii yatra kii or chaar mathon kii sthapana karke puure desh ko saanskrithik, dharmik, darshanik, aadhyatmik tathaa bhugolic ekta ke avichhinn sutara main band diya
 He gave a formula of liberation to all mankind - arthath durjan sajjan bane, sajjan shanti bane
 Be free from peaceful bonds and free other people
 apana prayojan puraa hone baad taintis varsh kii alpaayu main unhone is nashwar deh ko chhod diya
 Shankaracharya was a great ordinationist
 unhen hindu dharm ko punah sthapit evam pratishthit karne kaa shrey diya jaataa he
 On the one hand he reinforced the philosophical basis of Sanatan Hinduism by reviving Advaita thinking, on the other hand he also tried to justify the idolatry prevalent in the masses
 sanathan hindu dharm ko drudh aadhaar pradaan karne ke liye unhone virdohi panth ke mat ko bhi aanshik taur par angikaar kiya
 Mahayana Buddhist thought is believed to have an influence on Shankar's Mayanism
 isi aadhaar par unhen prachhnn buddha kaha gaya he
 a 108-foot statue of Adi Shakracharya Ji Maharaj is being installed in Omkareshwar district Khandwa Madhya Pradesh
 kai europea vidwaanon kaa hawala dete hue, Lucian Blaga samajhataa he ki aadi shankaracharya 'sabhi samay kaa sabase bade tatvamimasaa kaa vidwaan he'
 Adi Shankaracharya said that there are two types of knowledge
 ek paraavidya kaha jaataa he or anya main aparaavidya kaha jaataa he
 The first is Saguna Brahma but the second is Nirguna Brahm
 saamaajik pragati parishad vah vichaar he ki samaaj, apni saamaajik, raajnneetik or aarthik sanrachanaon ke sambandh main, behatar kar sakate hai yaa karte hai
 The winner is a 1982 Hindi language film
 maury vansh kii shakti ke shithil hone par jab magadh samrajya ke anek sudurvarti pradesh maury samraaton kii adheenta se mukt hone lage, to kaling bhi swatantra ho gaya
 Three miles from Bhubaneswar in Odisha, there is a hill named Udayagiri, in whose cave an inscription is available, which is famous as 'hathigumpha Inscription'
 ise kalingraj kharvel ne utkeern karaayaa tha
 This article is in Prakrit language and has great importance for ancient Indian history
 iske anusaar kaling ke swatantra rajya ke raja pracheen 'ail vansh' ke cheti yaa chedi kshatriya the
 In the Chedi dynasty there was a majestic king named 'mahamedhavahana', who took advantage of the weakness of the Mauryas and established his independent rule in Kalinga
 mahamedhvahan kii teesri peedi main kharvel hua, jiskaa vrittant hathigumpha shilaalekh main vishad ke rup se ullikhit he
 Kharavel was a follower of Jainism and probably during his time the majority of the Kalinga people had also adopted the religion of Vardhaman Mahavira
 hathigumpha ke shilaalekh ke anusaar kharvel ke jivan ke pehle pandraa varsh vidya ke adhyayan main vyateet hue
 During this period, he received the education of religion, meaning, governance, mudradhati, law, arsenal etc
 pandraa saal kii aayu main vah yuvaraj ke pad par niyukt hua or nau varsh tak is pad par rahane ke uparant choubees varsh kii aayu main vah kaling ke rajsinghaasana par arudh hua
 On becoming king, he held the titles of 'kalingadhipati' and 'kalinga Chakravarti'
 rajbhishek ke duusare varsh usne pashchim kii ore akraman kiya or raja satkarni kii upeksha kar kanavena ke tat par sthit moosik nagar ko usne trast kiya
 Satakarni was the Satavahana king and had an independent kingdom in Andhra Pradesh
 mauryon kii adheenta se mukt hokar jo pradesh swatantra ho gaye the, andhra bhi unamem se ek tha
 In the fourth year of his reign, Kharavel once again invaded the west and subjugated the Bhojakas and the charioteers
 bhojakon kii sthiti baraar ke kshetra main thi or rathikon kii purvi khandesh va ahmednagar main
 rathik-bhojakas were probably such Kshatriya clans, like the ancient blind-women who had their own republics
 ye ganraajya sambhavtah satvahanon kii adheenta sweekrut karte the
 In the eighth year of his reign, Kharavel traveled northwards to Vijay
 uttarapath main aage badhati hui uski sena ne baraabar pahadiyon main sthit gorthgiri ke durg par akraman kiya or use jitkar ve rajgrih pahunch gai
 While Kharavel was busy in these wars, the Yavanas of Bactria were also invading India
 bharat ke pashchim chakra ko apane adheen kar ve madhya desh main pahunch gaye the
 According to the article of Hathigumpha, Yavanaraja was frightened by the news of Kharavel's victories and left the idea of invading Madhya Pradesh and proceeded towards Mathura
 anek aitihaasikon ne yah pratipaadit kiya he, ki kharvel se bhaybheet hokar madhyadesh se waapas chale jane vaale is yavanraaja kaa naam dimit tha
 In the eleventh year of his reign, Kharavel invaded the south and reached the Tamil country on his Vijayatra
 vahaan par usne pithund ko jeeta or uske raja ko bhent uphaar pradaan karne ke liye vivash kiya
 The inscription of Hathigumpha mentions the confederation of the Tamil country defeated by Kharavel
 apane shasankaal ke gyarahawein varsh main kharvel ne ek baar phir uttarapath par akraman kiya or apni sena ke ghodon or haathiyon ko gangaajal snaan karaayaa
 He forced the king of Magadha to fall at his feet and brought back the Kalinga, the idol of Mahavir Swami, Pataliputra, taken from King Nand Kalinga
 is murti ke atirikt anya bhi bahut—si lut kharvel magadh se apane rajya main le gaya or uskaa upyog usne bhubaneshwar main ek vishaal mandir ke nirmaan ke liye kiya, jiskaa ullekh brahmand puraana kii urisa main praapt ek hastlikhit prati main bhi vidyaman he
 According to many historians, the king of Magadha who was forced by Kharavel to fall on his feet was debated
 unhone hathigumpha shilaalekh main is raja ke naam ko padhane kaa praytn bhi kiya he
 But not all scholars agree with this text
 shri jaiswal ne hathigumpha shilaalekh main ullikhit magadh ke raja ke naam ko bahestimit maanakar use pushyamitra shunga kaa paryaayavachi pratipaadit kiya he or yah mana he ki kalingraj kharvel ne shungavanshi pushyamitra par akraman kar use parrast kiya tha
 But many are not willing to accept the name in the historical Hathigumpha, nor to confuse it with Pushyamitra
 par isamen sandeh nahin ki hathigumpha shilaalekh ke anusaar kharvel ne uttarapath par akraman karte hue magadh kii bhi vijay kii thi or vahaan ke raja ko apane sammukh jhukne ke liye vivash kiya tha
 This story of Digvijay and the flourishing of Kharavel's power is undoubtedly of great importance
 pandulipi yaa maatrakagranth ek hastlikhit granthvishesh he 
 It is also known by the names of Hastrapati, Lipigranth etc
 angl bhashaa main yah Manuscript shabd se prasiddh he in granthon ko MS yaa MSS in sankshep naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he
 In Hindi language, it is famous with the names 'manuscript', 'handwriting', 'handwriting' etc
 aisa mana jaataa he ki solahavin shatabdi ke armbh main videshiyon ke dwaara sanskrit kaa adhyayan armbh hua 
 After the commencement of the study, its fame is considered in the late seventeenth century and in the beginning of the eighteenth century
 us kalkhand main bharat main sthit maatrakagranthon kaa adhyayan evam sangrakshan vividh sanghathanon ke dwaara kiya gaya 
 a manuscript is a document written by one person or several people by hand
 jaise hastlikhit patr
 Printed or by any other method, the material prepared by copying from another document is not called manuscript
 pandulipi apni raksha ke liye kya kahati he, dekhen- Initially, Sanskrit mother tongues were patronized by 'royal Asiatic Society' and 'india Office'
 1784 i
main 'royal aciatic socity' sanstha kii sthapana huyi 
 Through that institution, the work of calculating the existing mother tongues started in India
 is sanstha ke granth-sangrah kii suchi 1807 i

 The chief editors of that list were Sir William Jones and Lady Jones

 He preserved many maternal texts during his tenure
 unke dwaara likhit shodhapurna vivaranika aaj bhi landan main surakshit he 
 Other scholars following him published various treatises between 1817-1934

 DNA fingerprinting technology is used to solve the criminal cases
 iske saath hi maatrutiv, pitrutv yaa vyaktigat pahchaan ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye iskaa prayog hota he
 At present, fingerprint is considered the best among methods of identification
 jeev jantuon, manushyon main vishesh sanrachanayukta vah rasayan jo use vishisht pahchaan pradaan karata he, use diene kehete hai
 In this method, a person's DNA is identified by biological parts such as blood, hair, saliva, semen or other cell-sources
 diene fingerprint vishisht diene kram kaa prayog karata he, jise microcetellite kaha jaataa he
 Microsatellites are small fragments of DNA
 sharir ke kuch hisson main inaki sankhya alag-alag hoti he
 The activity of the trillions of cells present in the body is determined by DNA
 haalanki diene kanon kaa dhaancha har vyakti main ek samaan hota he, lekin unhen gadhane vaale buniyadi avyavon kaa kram sabhi main samaan nahin hota
 This difference is used to find identities between members of the same species
 is prakriya ko genetic fingerprinting or diene profiling bhi kaha jaataa he
 It was developed in 1984 by Sir Alec Jeffreys, scientist at the University of British Leicester
 forencik vigyaan main diene fingerprint kaa upyog hota he
 Forensic examination no longer requires actual fingerprint
 isaki madad se apradhi ko maatr ek boond ke aadhaar par hi pakadaa ja saktaa he
 The DNA sample is fragmented by the DNA enzyme taken
 iske baad isaki chaanbin karke ise eks-re film par expoj kiya jaataa he jahaan vah blike baar banaate hai, jinhen diene fingerprint kehete hai
 The Jeevan Sutra, that is, in all living organisms of the world, is based on heredity like humans

 Each organism can be distinguished from any other organism on the basis of subtle variations hidden in this life formula derived from its biological parents
 jivan sutara ke in atyadhik parivarti khandon ko alag karke, radio sakriy banaaye jane ke baad vaigyanik vidhi dwaara vishleshan karne se ek vyakti vishesh kaa kramadesh praapt kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki kramadarsh manushya ke liye usee tarah vishisht hota he, jaise ki anguuthe kaa nishaan
 Hence this method is popularly known as DNA finger printing
 isamen thode se hi di en e kaa prayog karke, di en e ke un vishisht bhaagon, jo vaividhypurna hote hai, ko ek rasinic shrunkhlaa abhikriya se vruddhigat karkon ko vishisht jaili samaan madhyam se alag karke har tukade kaa adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he
 Human being is identified by its qualities and name
 do vyakti sabhi gunon main samaan nahin hote
 Even if twins are the same, then there are differences among them
 twachaa kaa rang, baalo kaa rang, ankhon kii putliyon kaa rang, lambaai, awaz, chalane, uthne baithne kaa dhang, baat karne kaa tarika, rahan-sahan aadi aise lakshan hai, jinase manushyon main antar or pahchaan kii ja sakati he
 There was a need to legalize human personal identity and difference
 prayek maanav ke anguliyon ke nishaan bhinn hote hai
 The protuberances in them occur at different places

 In fact, it is a method of legally identifying humans, which francis-golton discovered long ago and is still practiced today

 The number of crimes in the world is increasing both with the development of civilization and science
 aparaadhon ke tareekon ke naye prakaar viksit ho gayi hai
 To prevent the flood of these crimes, only [first finger printing] is used
 rakt pareekshan se bhi aparaadhiyon ko pakadaney main sahaayta mili he
 DNA finger printing is the most unique new biological technique in the field of biotechnology

 There are various stages of DNA fingerprinting techniques
 yahaan teen vibhinn vyaktiyon ke gel pratichitra dekhie, jinka aapas main koi rishta nahin he
 These images look quite different from each other and each image is unique
 ek hi parivaar ke teen sadasyon ke gel pratichitra gailaree main dikhaae hai
 Here the images of mother and father are different, but the image of the son bears some resemblance to the images of mother and father
 yahaan samaan judawaan bacchon ke pratichitra ko dekhenge, to dikhataa he; ki ye donon purnataya ekasmaan hai
 Thus different individuals can be identified by DNA finger printing, the mother or father of the offspring can be identified; But it is not possible to identify identical twins

 mana d x d t = − t x { \ displaystyle { \ frac {dx}{dt}}={ \ frac {-t}{x}}} kaa hal nikaalnaa he
 Given that t = 0 x = 1 { \ displaystyle t = 0 \ , \ , \ , x = 1} is avakal sameekaran kaa thik-thik hal t 2 + x 2 = 1 { \ displaystyle t^{2}+x^{2}=1} he
 We solve this by taking h = 0, 1 { \ displaystyle h = 0,1}
 isse t = 0, 1 { \ displaystyle t=0,1} par x = 0, 994987426585 { \ displaystyle x=0,994987426585} praapt hota he
 Similarly, we get the value of x for different values of t, which are shown in the following table
 dhyaan den ki is avakal sameekaran ke vishuddh hal se t = 1 { \ displaystyle t=1} par x = 0 { \ displaystyle x=0} milegaa, jabaki is vidhi se x = 0

 Social networking sites are powerful means of communication and information, through which people are able to keep their talk without interruption
 yahi se saamaajik media kaa swaroop viksit hua he
 Social media is considered to be the best means of advertising to the people due to its reach to the general public
 haal hi ke kuch ek saalo main industry main aisi kranti dekhi ja rahi he
 On social media platforms such as Facebook, consumers are categorized according to different standards in which advertisements are shown to suit their age, interest, gender, activities, etc
 is vigyaapan ke sakaaratmak parinaam bhi praapt ho rahe hai saath hi saath aalochana bhi kii ja rahi he
 With social media, you can take your business forward by advertising it in many ways, which will also earn you a lot of profit
 soshal media kii samalochna vibhinn platform ke anuprayog main aasaani, unki kshamta, uplabdh jaankaree kii vishwasaneeyata ke aadhaar par hoti rahi he
 Although some platforms allow their consumers to communicate between platforms from one platform to another, many platforms do not provide their consumers with such a facility that they continue to be the center of criticism
 vahin babbti ja rahi saamaajik media cites ke kai saare nuksaan bhi hai
 These sites are also becoming a means of online exploitation
 aise kai cese darj kiye gaye hai jinamein soshal media plateforms kaa prayog logon ko saamaajik rup se hani pahunchaane, unki khichaai karne tathaa anya galat pravritiyon se kiya gaya
 Along with the widespread expansion of social media, many negative aspects are also emerging
 pichley varsh meerut main huyi ek ghatana ne saamaajik media ke khatarnaak paksh ko ujagar kiya tha
 It happened that the teenager uploaded a picture on Facebook, which was very objectionable, within hours of the uploading of this picture, hundreds of angry people of a community came out on the streets
 jabatak prashasan samaj paata ki maajaraa kya he, meerut main dange ke halaat ban gaye
 The administration did not let the situation deteriorate and soon it reached the uploader
 logon kaa maananaa he ki paramparik media ke aapattijnak vyavhaar kii tulana main nae saamaajik media ke is yug kaa aapattijnak vyavhaar kai myne main alag he
 While the mess can be spread easily through the new social media, this work can be carried out almost anonymously
 haalanki yah sach nahin he, agar koshish kii jaye to soshal media par aapattijnak vyavhaar karne vaale ko pakada ja saktaa he or in ghatnaon kii punrariti ko roka bhi ja saktaa he
 The arrest of that teenager in Meerut is not only an example of this, but it is also given by social media that many people involved in the London riots were caught by the police there and also filed cases against them
 or bhi kai udhaaharan he jaise bankur dange ke kai ahm suraag main soshal media kii bady bhoomika rahi
 How can this important role of social media be denied in the Egyptian Tahrir Check and the Jasmine Revolution of Tunisia
 soshal media kii aalochana uske vigyapanon ke liye bhi kii jaati he
 The plethora of advertisements on it confuse the consumer and such social media platforms act as a separate organization and do not take accountability of the advertisements which is very problematic
 jwalamukheey dweep aisa dweep hota he jo kisi jwalamukhi ke fatne se nikle hue pathar va chattaanon se ubharkar pani kii sataha se upar nikal aae

 According to the language survey of philosopher Dr
 Sir "george Abraham Grierson", the total population of Awadhi speakers was 1615458 which increased to 28399552 in the 1971 census

 Fahyan also mentions Ayodhya in his description
 aaj kii avadhi pravaas or samskruthikaran ke chalate khadi boli or angreji ke prabhaav main aa rahi he
 In the west of Awadhi lies the Bundeli and Braj of the western section, Chhattisgarhi in the south and Bhojpuri dialect in the east
 iske uttar main nepal kii tarai he jisamen tha degree aadi adivaasiyon kii bastiyaan hai jinaki bhashaa avadhi se bilkul alag he
 The variation of Awadhi from Hindi Khadiboli is mainly grammatical
 isamen karta kaarak ke parasarg "ne" kaa nitant abhaav he
 Other forms often have two forms - Harsva and long
 
 Like the standing of nouns, there are two distinctions - vikari and invariant
 avikari vibhakti main sangya kaa mul rup rahata he or vikari main bahuvachan ke liye "na" pratyay jod diya jaataa he 
 At the end of consonant nouns in the invariable form of doer and karma, in some dialects there is a praise of a "u"
 kintu nishchay hi yah purna swar nahin he or bhashavigyaani ise fusfusaahat ke swar-hrasv "i" or hrasv "e" milte hai
 Nouns often have two forms, hrasva and long
 inke atirikt avadhi kshetra ke purvi bhaag main ek or rup-dirghatar miltaa he 
 At some places in Awadhi, the form of khadiboli has disappeared; Belaia, Debia, etc
 are not available in the form of cat, box etc
 sarvnaam main khadiboli or braj ke "meraa tera" or "mero tero" rup ke liye avadhi main "mor tor" rup hai
 Apart from these, "aw" in Western Awadhi derives from "so" "jo" "" parallel to "" "J" "K"
 kriya main bhavishyakaal roopon kii prakriya khadiboli se bilkul bhinn he
 In Khadiboli, forms are often made by adding ga-ge-gay to the modern forms of ancient present
 braj main bhavishyat ke rup pracheen bhavishyatkaal ke roopon par aadhaarit hai
 
 avadhi main praaia: bhavishyat ke rup tavyat pratyyant pracheen roopon par ashrith hai 
 In the western dialects of Awadhi, only the forms of Uttam Purusha plural depend on poetical forms
 shesh braj kii tarah pracheen bhavishyat par
 But in the intermediate and eastern dialects, there has been an increase in the prevalent forms of dissimilar forms
 kriyaarthak sangya ke liye khadiboli main "naa" pratyay he or braj main "no" 
 But "B" is the suffix for it in Awadhi
 avadhi main nishtha ekvachan ke rup kaa "vaa" main ant hota he 
 In Bhojpuri, the place ending in "L" is found in its place
 avadhi kaa ek mukhya bhedak lakshan he anypurush ekvachan kii sakarmak kriya ke bhootkaal kaa rup 
 y - The forms ending in "si" are not found elsewhere except Awadhi
 avadhi kii sahaayak kriya main rup "ha", "ah" or "baati" par aadhaarit hai
 According to the above symptoms, three classes of dialects of Awadhi are considered: Western, Intermediate and Eastern
 pashchimi boli par nikatataa ke kaaran braj kaa or purvi par bhojpuri kaa prabhaav he
 Apart from these, the Bagheli dialect has its own existence
 vikaas kii drushti se avadhi kaa sthaan braj, kannauji or bhojpuri ke bich main padataa he
 Braj is definitely derived from Shaurseni and Magadhi Prakrit of Bhojpuri
 avadhi kii sthiti in donon ke bich main hone ke kaaran iskaa ardhamagadhi se nikalnaa maananaa uchit hoga
 Sadly, the oldest form of Ardhamagadhi that we find is of the fifth century AD and it is difficult to derive the form of Avadhi
 pali bhashaa main bahudhaa aise rup milte hai jinase avadhi ke roopon kaa vikaas siddh kiya ja saktaa he
 Probably these forms may have been of the ancient Ardhamagadhi
 pracheen avadhi sahitya kii do shakhaayen hai : ek bhakthikavy or duusari premakhyaan kavy
 Goswami Tulsidas's "ramcharitmanas" in Bhaktikavya is the major work of Awadhi literature

 premakhyaan kavy main musalmaan lekhakon ne sufi mat kaa rahasy prakat kiya he
 The tradition of this poem continued for several hundred years
 manzan kii "madhumalati", usmaan kii "chitrawali", alam kii "madhavanal kaamkandala", nurmuhammad kii "indravati" or shaikh nisaar kii "yusuf julekha" isi parampara kii rachanaayen hai
 In terms of terminology, these compositions differ from the texts of Hindu poets in that they do not have the same abundance of Sanskrit words
 pracheen avadhi sahitya main adhiktar rachanaayen deshprem, samajasudhar aadi vishyon par or mukhya rup se vyangyatmak hai
 Among the poets are Pratapnarayan Mishra, Balabhadra Dixit "padhis", Vanshidhar Shukla, Chandrabhushan Dwivedi "ramai Kaka", Guru Prasad Singh "mrigesh" and Shardaprasad "bhushundi"
 prabandh kii parampara main "ramcharitamanas" ke dhang kaa ek mahatvapurn aadhunik granth dwarikaprasad mishra kaa "krishnayan" he
 Its language and style is similar to that of "manas" and the author has written Krishnacharita, often with the same intensity and detail as Tulsidas's Ramcharit, which is written by Tulsidas
 mishra ji ne is granth kii rachana dwaara yah siddh kar diya he ki prabandh ke liye avadhi kii prakruti aaj bhi waisi hi upadey he jaisi tulsidas ke samay main thi

 But his policy was misinterpreted in India and in England

 Badu or Baduin is an Arab human race who traditionally lead nomadic lives and are divided into tribes called 'ashair'
 yah adhiktar jordan, iraq, arabi prayadweep or uttar africa ke registani kshetron main rahete hai
 There are two types of deserts in the Arabic language - semi-arid region and severe arid zone
 ardh-registani ilaake ko 'badiyah' kehete hai jabaki purna registan ko 'saharaa' bulaate hai
 The settlers in Badiyah are called 'baduvi' and from this the word 'badu' has come
 badu samaaj main vafadaari kaa bahut mahatv he or isamen shreneeyaan hoti hai: pehle apane qareebi parivaar se, phir apane rishtedaaron se or phir qabeele se
 There is a bad saying that 'I am against my brothers, i and my brothers against my relatives, i and my relatives against my clan and i and my tribe against strangers'
 ek badu parivaar ko 'bait' kaha jaataa he, jiskaa arth 'ghar' yaa 'tamboo' he
 These tents are often called 'bait as-shire', meaning 'house of hair', as these tents are often made of camel and goat hair
 isamen ek dampati, unke mata-pita or unke bachche hote hai
 Often a group of batons move together from place to place and such group is called 'goom'
 goumon main aapasi rishtedaar hote hai, lekin aksar agar koi navvivaahit stri kisi goum kaa bhaag banati he to uske kuch purush sambandhi bhi us goum main aa milte hai
 The Samajit class above the Gooum is called 'ibn Amm', which means 'uncle / son of Taya'
 isamen ek hi parivaar ke teen se paanch pidiyon ke vanshaj shaamil hote hai
 Often different Goom of a descendant group are engaged in different occupations

 Sometimes strangers are also included in a descendant group

 For example, members of the 'banu Kinanah' clan who settled in the Hijaz and Tihamah regions of Saudi Arabia are all considered to be the offspring of a historical man named 'kinanah'
 yah bhi dekha jaataa he ki ajanabiyon ko kabhi-kabhi qabeelon main daakhil kar liya jaataa he or vah swayan ko bhi us purvaj kaa vanshaj samajhane lagate hai
