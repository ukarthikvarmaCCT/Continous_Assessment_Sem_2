 Sunday fast story According to the story of Sunday Vrat Katha, there was an old lady, the rule of her life was that every Sunday morning, she used to bathe in the morning and purify the house with dung
 iske baad vah bhojan taiyaar karti thi, bhagwaan ko bhoga laga kar swayan bhojan grahan karti thi
 She had been doing this activity for a long time
 aansa karne se uskaa ghar sabhi dhan - dhaany se paripurna tha
 That old lady used to bring cow dung of another old cow living in Padaos to cleanse her house
 jis ghar se vah budhiya gobar laati thi, vah vichaar karne lagi ki yah mere gaay kaa hi gobar kyon lekar aati he
 So she tied her cow inside the house
 budhiya gobar na milane se ravivaar ke din apane ghar ko gobar se lip kar shuddh na kar saki
 Due to this, neither did he prepare food nor did he indulge
 Thus, he fasted on that day
 raatri hone par vah bhukhi hi so gai
 Lord Surya Dev came in his night and asked him the reason for this
 The old man told what was the reason
 tab bhagwaan ne kaha ki, mata tumhen sarvakaamana poorak gaay dete hai, bhagwaan ne use vardaan main gaay di, dhan or putr diya
 And by granting the boon of salvation, they became enlightened
 In the morning, when he opened his eyes, he found a beautiful cow and calf in the courtyard
 vriddha ati prasann ho gai
 When his neighbor saw the cow calf tied outside the house, he got jealous
 Also saw that cow has dung of gold
 usne vah gobar apni gaayt ke gobar se badal diya
 By doing this daily, the old lady did not even know about it
 bhagwaan ne dekha, ki chaalaak padosan budhiya ko thag rahi he, to unhone jor kii aandhi chalaa di
 The old lady tied the cow inside the house
 subah hone par usne gaay ke sone ke gobar ko dekha, to uske aashcharya kii seemaa naa rahi
 Now she started tying the cow inside itself
 udhar padosan ne irshyaa se raja ko shikaayat kar di, ki budhiya ke paas raajaaon ke yogya gaay he, jo sona detii he
 The king heard this and asked his messengers to get the cow
 budhiya ne viyog main, akhand vrath rakhe rakhaa
 On the other hand, the king's palace was filled with cow dung
 raja ne raat ko use spane main gaay lautaane ko kaha
 praatah hote hi raja ne aisa hi kiya
 At the same time, given proper punishment to the neighborhood
 raja ne sabhi nagar vaasiyon ko vrath rakhane kaa nirdesh diya
 From then on, all the townsmen started observing this fast
 or ve khushiyon ko praapt hue
ravivaar ke vrath ke vishay main yah kaha jaataa he ki is vrath ko surya ast ke samay hi samaapt kiya jaataa he
 If for some reason the sun sets and the fasting person cannot eat food, then he should not remain foodless till sunrise the next day

 This shows that Khandav, Turghna and Parin were the boundaries of Kurukshetra and Maru district was some distance away from Kurukshetra

 It is known that although Vanaparva mentions certain pilgrimages on the Saraswati coast and Kurukshetra in the 83rd chapter, they do not match with the pilgrimages mentioned in the Brahmins and the Shrutasutras, only in the case of 'vinashan' and 'sarak'
 Can go isse yah prakat hota he ki vanaparv kaa saraswati evam kurukshetra se sambandhit ullekh shrautasutron ke ullekh se kai shatabdiyon ke pashchaat kaa he
 Naradiya Purana has given the names of about 100 pilgrimages of Kurukshetra

 The mythological significance of Kurukshetra is considered to be high

 The legendary river Saraswati also has great significance

 iskaa rugveda or yajurveda main anek sthano par varnan kiya gaya he
 The legendary river Saraswati also has great significance
 saraswati ek puranic nadi jisaki charchaa vedon main bhi he
 Apart from this, it has been detailed in many Puranas, Smriti and Mahabharata composed Maharishi Veda Vyasa

 It is a very sacred place

 In the Rigveda, the son of Trusadasu, Kurushravan is mentioned
 'kurushravan' kaa shabdic arth he 'kuru kii bhoomi main suna gaya yaa prasiddh
 In the Atharvaveda there is a discussion of a Kauravya husband, who talks to his wife
 brahman-granthon ke kaal main kurukshetra ati prasiddh tirth-sthal kaha gaya he
 a saga mentioned in the Shatapatha Brahmana shows that the Devas performed a yajna at Kurukshetra in which they had previously deprived both Ashvins of the yagya-bhaga
 maitrayani samhita evam taittiriya brahman kaa kathan he ki devon ne kurukshetra main satr kaa sampaadan kiya tha
 The implicit feeling in these utterances is that in the Brahmin period, the Vedic people gave great importance to the sacrifice of Yajna, as it is mentioned in the Rigveda - 'yajnayya Yajnamayajanta Devastani Dharmani Prathamanyasana
 ' The region which was repeatedly plowed by Kuru was named Kurukshetra
 kehete hai ki jab kuru bahut manoyog se is kshetra kii jutai kar rahe the tab indra ne unase jaakar is parishram kaa kaaran poocha
 Kuru said- 'whoever is killed here will go to the virtuous world
 ' indra unka parihaas karte hue swarglok chale gayi
 This happened many times
 indra ne devataaon ko bhi bataaya
 The gods said to Indra - 'if possible, make Kuru friendly to you, otherwise if people go to heaven without sacrificing our part there, then our part will be destroyed
 ' tab indra ne pun: kuru ke paas jaakar kaha-'nareshwar, tum vyarth hi ksht kar rahe ho
 If any animal, bird or human being killed here by staying foodless or fighting it will be part of heaven
 ' kuru ne yah baat maan lee
 This place is called samanta-panchak or Prajapati's Uttaravadi

 isiliye mahavani main main vihaar-leen naval-kishor ke dhyaan kaa nirdesh kiya gaya he ~ The Kadamba Dynasty was an ancient royal family of Karnataka that ruled from Banavasi in present day Uttara Kannada district
 The dynasty later continued to rule as a feudatory of larger Kannada empires, the Chalukya and the Rashtrakuta empires for over five hundred years during which time they branched into Goa and Hanagal
 At the peak of their power under King Kakushtavarma, they ruled large parts of Karnataka
 During the pre-kadamba era the ruling families that controlled Karnataka, the Mauryas, Satavahanas and Chutus were not natives of the region and the nucleus of power resided outside present day Karnataka
 The Kadambas were the first indigenous dynasty to use Kannada, the language of the soil at an administrative level

 On the other hand, apart from Kaab and Sayto, all the other members return to reality with different shakes at the same time: like Ariadne's jump on the balcony, the explosives of Eames that destroy the fort, Arthur is asleep in the elevator through the blast The team is woken up by a collision, and the van also collides with the surface of the water
 kaab aakhirkaar us antarim duniya main umradraj ho chuke saito ko paakar, uske ekararnaame kii yaad dilaataa he
 The two then wake up in the same plane where the rest of the team and Robert Fischer had already woken up

 What was then, Archimedes became so excited by his discovery that he forgot to wear clothes and ran in the streets in a naked state shouting "eureka!" sone ke mukut kii kahani archimedes ke gyaat kaaryon main prakat nahin hoti he
 Furthermore, due to the excessive amount of accuracy required in the measurement of water displacement, the feasibility of the method described by it has been questioned
 sambhavat: archimedes ne ek aisa hal diya jo jalsthitiki main archimedes ke siddhant naamak siddhant par lagu hota he, jise ve apane ek granth on floating bodis main varnit karte hai
 According to this theory, an object immersed in a liquid exerts a buoyancy force that is equal to the weight of the liquid it removes
 is siddhant kaa prayog karte hue, sone ke mukut ke ghanatv kii tulana thos sone se karnaa sambhav ho gaya hoga, iske liye pehle mukut ko sone ke ek namoonay ke saath ek paimaane par santulit kiya gaya hoga, phir tantra ko pani main dubaaya gaya hoga
 If the crown was less dense than gold, it would have replaced more water due to its greater volume and thus the buoyancy force applied to it would have been greater than the sample
 utplavakta main yah antar paimaane par dikhaayi diya hoga
 Galileo considered that "archimedes may have used this method, since, to be very precise, it is based on the performance given by Archimedes himself
" " a large part of the work by Archimedes in the field of engineering came from meeting the needs of his own city of Syracuse
 unani lekhak naukratis ke athenus ne varnit kiya ki kaise raja hiron II ne archimedes ko ek vishaal jahaaj, syracusia dizin karne ke liye kaha, jise vilasitapurna yatra karne ke liye, saamaan kii supplai karne ke liye or nausena ke yudhpot ke rup main prayukt kiya ja sake
 Siracusia is believed to have been the largest ship in ancient times
 athenus ke anusaar, yah 600 logon ko le jane main sakasham tha, saath hi isaki suvidhaon main ek bageeche kii sajaavat, ek vyaayaamashaala or devi effordit ko samarpit ek mandir bhi tha
 Since a ship of this size would leak a large amount of water through the hull, Archimedes' screw was made to remove this water
 archimiddiz kii mashin ek ek upkaran thi, jisamen ek belan ke bheetar ghurnan karte hue scru ke aakaar ke blade the
 It was rotated by hand and could also be used to transfer water from a low-lying body of water to an irrigation canal
 archimedes ke scru kaa upyog aaj bhi drav or kaneey thos jaise koyala or anaaj ko pump karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Archimedes' screw described by Vitruvius in Roman times was probably an improvement on the screw pump that was used to irrigate the hanging gardens of the Babylonians
 archimedes kaa panja ek hathiyaar he, mana jaataa he ki unhone seracus shahar kii raksha ke liye ise dizin kiya tha
 Also known as "the Ship Shaker", this claw had a crane-like arm from which a large metal hook hung
 jab is panje ko ek akraman karte hue jahaaj par daalaa jaataa tha, bhujaa upar kii ore uthati thi or jahaaj ko ko uthaakar pani se baahar nikaalati thi or sambhawatah ise duba detii thi
 Modern tests have been conducted to investigate the feasibility of this claw, and in 2005 a television documentary titled Super Weapons of the Ancient World created a version of this claw and concluded that it was a working device
 2 shatabdi i
 ke lekhak lucian ne likhaa ki seracus kii gheraabandi ke dauraan, archimedes ne aag se shatru ke jahaajon ko nasht kar diya
 Centuries later Anthemias of Trelage referred to the burning glass as Archimedes' weapon
 yah upkaran, kabhi kabhi "archimedes ki ushma kiran" kehalaata he, iskaa upyog lakshya jahaaj par surya ke prakaash ko focus karne ke liye kiya jaataa tha, jisase ve aag lakad lete the
 This alleged weapon has been the subject of debate since the Renaissance
 rene descartes ne ise galat kah kar kaarij kar diya, jabaki aadhunik vaigyanikon ne keval unheen sadhano kaa upyog karte hue us prabhaav ko punah utpann karne kii koshish kii he, jo archimedes ko uplabdh the
 It has been suggested that a large group of layers of heavily polished bronze or copper serve as mirrors, presumably which were used to focus sunlight onto the ship
 isamen paravalay paravarti ke siddhant kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha, jaise saura bhatti main kiya jaataa he
 a trial of Archimedes heat ray was carried out in 1973 by the Greek scientist Lonis Sakkas
 yah prayog athens ke baahar skaramjes nausena base par kiya gaya
 At this time 70 mirrors were used, each was polished with a copper and its size was about 5x3 feet
 The mirrors were placed in the direction of a plywood mock-up of a Roman warship about 160 feet away
 jab darpanon ko thik prakaar se focus kiya gaya, jahaaj kuch hi kshanon main aag kii lapaton main jalane laga
 The plywood was polished with tar paint on the ship, which further contributed to the combustion
 oktober 2005 main mesachusets prodyogiki santhaan ke vidhyaarthiyon ke samooh ne 127 ek foot kii vargakar darpan tilon ke saath ek prayog kiya, inhen lagbhag 100 feet kii duuri par sthit lakdi ke ek mock-up jahaaj par focus kiya
 Flames erupted at one place on the ship, but only when there were no clouds in the sky and the ship remained in the same position for about ten minutes
 yah nishkarsh niklaa gaya ki yah upkaran in paristhitiyon main ek vyavhaarya hathiyaar tha
 The MIT group repeated the experiment for the television show Mythbusters, using a wooden fishing boat in San Francisco as the target
 ek baar phir se aisa hi hua, kam maatra main aag lag gayi
 To catch fire, the wood has to reach its ignition point, which is about 300 ° C
 jab mithbsters ne janvari 2006 main sen francisco ke parinaam kaa prasaaran kiya, is daawey ko "asafal" kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya, kyonki is dahan hone ke liye samay kii upyukt lambaai or mausam kii adarsh paristhitiyaan anivaary hai
 It was also pointed out that because Syracuse is facing the sun to the east, the Roman fleet would have to attack in the morning to collect favorable light from the mirrors
 mithbsters ne yah bhi kaha ki paaramparik hathiyaar, jaise jwalanth tir yaa ek gulel se bheje gaye tir, kam duuri se jahaaj ko jalane kaa adhik aasaan tarika he
 While Archimedes did not discover the lever, he first gave a rigorous description of the theory involved
 alegsendriya ke pappas ke anusaar, livers par unke kaary se unhone tippanee di: "mujhe khadey hone kii jagah do or main prithvi ko gati de duungaa
" plutark ne is baat kaa varnan kiya ki kaise archimedes ne block-or-tekal ghirani pranali ko dizin kiya, jisase aisi vastuon ko uthaane main navikon ne liverej kaa siddant istemaal kiya, jo itani baari thim ki unhen anyathaa hilaanaa bhi bahut mushkil hota tha
 Archimedes has also been credited with improving the ability and accuracy of the catapult and invented the odometer during the First Punic War
 odometer ko ek gear se yukt ek gaadi kii pranali ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he, jo har ek mile chalane ke baad ek gend ko ek paatr main daalati he
 Cicero briefly mentions Archimedes in his Dialogue de Rey Publica, in 129 BC after the siege of Syracuse
 a fictional conversation depicted in, c
 212 BC, General Marcus Claudius Marcellus is said to have brought back two systems in Rome, which were used to aid astronomy, the Sun, Moon and the Five Shows the motion of the planets
 siciro usee tarah kii pranali kaa ullekh karte hai jaisi pranali militus ke thels or needs ke yudoxs ke dwaara dizin kii gayi
 According to this dialogue, Marcellus kept one device as his personal loot from Syracuse and donated all the others to the Temple of Virtue in Rome
 siciro ke anusaar marcelas kii pranali ko geiyas salpikas gelis ke dwaara lukias furias philis ko darshaya gaya, jisane ise is prakaar se varnit kiya: It is a description of a planetarium or Orei)
 alegsendriya ke pappas ne kaha ki archimedes ne in nirdisht pranaaliyon ke nirmaan par ek pandulipi likhi he On sphere-making
 Modern studies in this area focus on the antikythera system, another device from ancient times that was probably designed for a similar purpose
 is prakaar kii nirmaanatmak pranali ke liye avakal gearing ke parishkrut gyaan kii aavashyaktaa rahi hogi
 It was once thought to be outside the range of technology available in ancient times, but the discovery of the Antikythera system in 1902 ensured that such devices were known to the ancient Greeks

 Through proof by contradiction, they could solve a problem up to a random fraction of accuracy, specifying the limits in which the answer occurred
 yah takanic purnataa kii vidhi kehalaati he or unhone iskaa prayog pai ) ke sannikat maan kaa pataa lagane main kiya
 For this he painted a large polygon outside a vow and a small polygon inside the vow
 jaise jaise bahubhuj kii bhujaaon kii sankhya badhati he, vrath kaa sanniktan adhik sateek ho jaataa he
 When each polygon had 96 sides, they calculated the lengths of their sides and showed that the value of π was between 31⁄7 and 310⁄71, corresponding to its true value of about 3
1416
 unhone yah bhi pramanit kiya ki vraton kaa kshetrafal π or vrath kii trigya ke varg ke gunanfal ke baraabar tha
 In measuring a vow, Archimedes states the square root value of 3 to be greater than 265⁄153 and less than 1351⁄780

 He wrote: "some people, King Gello, think that the number of soils is infinite in the infinite; and i believe that the soil is not only in Syracuse and the rest of Sicily, but in every region where there is housing or no housing
 is samasya kaa hal karne ke liye, archimedes ne asankhya ke aadhaar par gananaa kii ek pranali di

 The oldest document in which Archimedes works is Archimedes Palimpsest
 In 1906, a Danish professor, John Ludwig Heiberg, visited Constantinople and examined the Gotskin parchment of prayer written in the 13th century AD
 unhone paaya ki yah ek palimpcest tha, ek paathya se yukt ek dastavej jise mitaae gaye puraane kaary ke upar likhaa gaya tha
 To make the palimpsest, the ink on it was scraped off and reused, a common practice in the Middle Ages, as parchment was expensive

 People were very impressed with the views expressed in it
 Seth Ghanshyam Das Birla also came to attend the convention
 unka yadhyapi podaar ji se purna mataiky nahin tha tathaapi vah bhaashan unhen pasand aayaa
 Expressing his response the other day, he said to Poddar ji - what are the views of people sent to you, how are we saying we are not critical of this criticism? But they are being propagated by you in the society, people believe it even to a long distance

 Welfare was discussed during the conversation
 Shri Krishna Das ji said - Bhai ji letter must come out
 Poddar ji also spoke of lack of experience in front of him
 Shri Krishna Das Ji spoke of giving support
 Poddar ji was condescending
 Then Shri Krishnadas Ji said to Poddar Ji - God saved you from earthquake in Assam
 God wants you to do something big
 Poddar ji became silent before this argument
 Now "kalyan" was registered and the material was collected and given to the press
 shravan krishna 11 samvath 1983 vikrami ko "kalyaan kaa pehla ank niklaa | prakaashak tha satsang bhawan nemaani bari bombay | is prakaar kalyaan kaa pratham ank niklaa ank sabko bahut pasand aayaa | prarambh main isaki 1600 graahak the sab banaae hue the bane hue nahin | kalyaan ke liye gandhi ji se poddar ji ne aashirwad maanga | gandhi ji ne vigyaapan or pustak samiksha na chhapane kii salaah di | poddar ji ise shirodharya kiya or aaajeevan iskaa nirvaah kiya | aaj bhi kalyaan main vigyaapan nahin chapa jaataa | kalyaan ke 12 saadhaaran ank tathaa duusare varsh kaa pehla ank bhagavannamak visheshank bombay se niklaa | baad main iskaa prakaashan se gitapress gorakhpur se hone laga | is nimitt poddar ji bombay se gorakhpur aa gaye | To make Kalyan an ideal and interesting magazine, Bhai ji then wrote letters to writers and saints etc
 who interfered in the Mahatma's religious subjects all over the country and invited articles on various topics for it
 iske saath hi unhone shreshthatam kalakaaron se devi-devataaon ke aakarshak chitra banawaye or unako kalyaan main prakashit kiya
 Bhai ji was so engrossed in this task that he started giving all his time for it
 kalyaan kii saamagree ke sampadan se lekar uske rang-rup ko antim rup dene kaa kaary bhi bhayeeji hi dekhte the
 For this, he used to give eighteen hours daily
 kalyaan ko unhone maatr hindu dharm kii hi patrika ke rup main pahchaan dene kii bajaay usame sabhi dharmon ke aacharyon, jain muniyon, ramanuj, nimbark, maadhv aadi sampradaayon ke vidwaanon ke lekhon kaa prakaashan kiya
 During his lifetime, Bhaiji published more than six hundred books in Geeta Press Gorakhpur
 iske saath hi unhone is baat kaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa ki pathakon ko ye pustaken laagat mulya par hi uplabdh hon
 Special issues were published from time to time to make welfare more interesting and informative
 bhai ji ne apane jivan kaal main prachaar-prasar se dur rahakar aise aise kaaryon ko anjaam diya jisaki bas kalpana hi kii ja sakati he
 In 1936, there was a severe flood in Gorakhpur
 baadh peedit kshetra ke nirikshan ke liye pan
 jawaharlal nehru -jab gorakhpur aae to tatkaaleen angrej sarkaar ke dabaav main unhen vahaan kisi bhi vyakti ne car uplabdh nahin karai, kyonki angrej colector ne sabhi logon ko dhauns de rakhi thi ki jo bhi nehru ji ko car degaa uskaa naam vidrohiyon kii suchi main likh diya jayega
 But Bhai Ji gave his car to Nehru
 1938 main jab rajasthan main bhayankar akaal padaa to bhai ji akaal peedit kshetra main pahunche or unhone akaal peediton ke saath hi maweshiyon ke liye bhi chaare kii vyavastha karwaai
 Bhaiji played an important role in the establishment of ved-bhawan and schools at places like Badrinath, Jagannathpuri, Rameswaram, Dwarka, Kaladi Srirangam etc
 apane jivan-kaal main bhai ji ne 25 hajaar se zyada prishthon kaa sahitya-srijan kiya
 Bhai Ji had warned about the adverse effects of films on the society in his book 'cinema Entertainment or Destruction'
 dahej ke naam par nari utpeedan ko lekar bhai ji ne `vivaah main dahej' jaisi ek prerak pustak likhakar is buraai par apane gambhir vichaar vyakt kiye the
 Advocate for women's education, Bhai Ji wrote a book in the name of 'nari Shiksha' and in the name of current education to improve education
 goraksha andolan main bhi bhai ji ne bharpoor yogadan diya
 He fully supported the 166-day fast by Mahatma Ramchandra Veer in the 1966 Virat Goraksha movement
 bhai ji ke jivan se kai chamatkaarik or prerak ghatnaayen judi hui he
 But the most important thing in his life is that despite having connections with a well-to-do family and being connected with many important people in his lifetime and getting close to him, Bhai ji was not even touched with pride
 ve aaajeevan aam aadmi ke liye sochate rahe
 His contribution in the promotion and propagation of Sanatan Dharma and religious literature in this country is remarkable
 gita press gorakhpur se pustakon ke prakaashan se hone vaali aamadani main se unhone ek hissaa bhi nahin liya or is baat kaa likhit dastavej banaaya ki unke parivaar kaa koi bhi sadsy isaki aamadani main hissedaar nahin rahegaa
 In view of his religion and literature service and his popularity in Gorakhpur in the British era, the then British Collector Peddle proposed to confer him with the title of 'rai Saheb', but Bhai Ji politely declined the offer
 iske baad angrej kamishnar hobert ne `raay bahadur' kii oopaadhi dene kaa prastaav rakhaa lekin bhai ji ne is prastaav ko bhi sweekaar nahin kiya
 After the independence of the country, in consultation with Dr
, Sampurnanand, Kanhaiyalal Munshi and others, the then Union Home Minister Govind Vallabh Pant proposed to honor Bhai Ji with the title of 'bharat Ratna' but Bhai ji showed no interest in it either
 
 22 march 1971 ko bhai ji ne is nashwar sharir kaa tyaag kar diya or apane peeche ve `gita press gorakhpur' ke naam se ek aisa centre chhod gaye, jo hamaari samskruti ko puure vishwa main failaane main ek agrani bhoomika nibhaa rahaa he

 spray toweron yaa spray kakshon pradooshan niyantran praudyogiki ke ek farm rahe hai
 They consist of empty liquid made of cylindrical steel or plastic and spray liquid into nozzles
 inlate gas dhara aamtaur par tower ke neeche main pravesh karti he or urdhv chaal, jabaki taral neeche ek yaa ek se adhik staron se chhidkaav kiya jaataa he
 This flow of gas liquid in the inlet and opposite direction is called countercurrent flow
 chitra 1 ek theth spray pratidhaara pravaah tower se pataa chalata he
 This type of technology is a part of the group of air pollution control collectively referred to as wet scrubbers
 pratidhaara pravaah outlet gas sabase kam pradooshak freshest scrubbing taral karne ke liye ekaagratha ke saath ujagar karata he
 Several nozzles are placed all over the tower to spray all of the gas at different heights as it moves through the tower
 kai nalika kaa upyog karne ke liye kaaran thik pradooshak kanon ko prabhavit buundon kii sankhya ko adhiktam karne ke liye or gas ko avashoshit karne ke liye ek bade sataha kshetra pradaan karne ke liye hai
 Theoretically, the formation of small droplets, high collection efficiency is achieved for both gaseous particles and pollutants
 haalanki, taral buundon kaaphi bade ke liye kiya ja baahar nahin jhaadi outlet gas dhara se randi ke hona chahie
 Therefore, spray towers are meant to use nozzles that are typically 500 to 1000 μm in diameter to produce droplets
 Although small in size, these drops are larger than those made in VENTURI scrubbers that are 10 to 50 μm in size
 gas veg kam rakhaa jaataa he, 0
3 se 1
2 m / s tower ke baahar kiya ja rahaa se adhik buundon ko rokane ke liye
 In order to maintain low gas velocity, spray towers must be larger than other scrubbers that handle similar gas stream flow rates
 ek or spray toweron main hone vaali samasya yah he ki buundon ke baad kam duuri main giravat, ve agglomerate karne ke liye karte hai yaa tower kii deevaaron maaraa
 natijatan, sampark ke liye kul taral sataha kshetra kam he, randi kii sangrah kshamta ko kam karne
 Figure 2 - Crosscurrent flow spray towers
 In addition to a configurable countercurrent flow, the flow in the spray towers can be either a cocurrent or crosscurrent in the configuration
 Cocurrent pravaah spray toweron main, ek hi disha main inlate gas or taral pravaah
 kyonki gas dhara taral spray ke khilaaf nahin "dhakka" karata he, vahikaaon ke madhyam se gas veg countercurrentflow spray toweron main adhik se adhik hai
 As a result, cocurrent flow spray towers are smaller than countercurrent flow spray towers treated with the same amount of exhaust flow
 Crosscurrent pravaah spray toweron main bhi kshaitij spray scrubar kaha jaataa he, gas or taral pravaah dishaao main ek duusare sidhaa karne ke liye
 The gas in this vessel flows through a number of horizontal spray sections

 Indian sages have tried to understand the mystery of the world from many angles
 bhartiya darshanikon ke bare main tii es aliot ne kaha tha- How and under what circumstances Indian philosophy came into existence, nothing can be said authentically
 kintu itnaa spasht he ki upanishad kaal main darshan ek pruthak shaastra ke rup main viksit hone laga tha
 The tendency to explore the elements is in India from that remote period, which we call as 'vedic Age'
 rugveda ke atyant pracheen yug se hi bhartiya vichaaron main dwividh pravriti or dwividh lakshya ke darshan hamen hote hai

 The synergistic and rational-minded tendencies led to the emergence of the soul's formal philosophy

 isi patitapavani dhara ko log darshan ke naam se pukaarte hai
 Inventors think that the first use of the word in its present sense was in Vaiseshika philosophy
 'darshan' shabd panineey vyakaran ke anusaar 'drishir prekshane' dhaatu se lut pratyay karne se nishpann hota he
 Therefore, the word darshan would mean 'to see or be seen' or 'to be seen'
 darshan shabd kaa shabdaarth keval dekhnaa yaa saamaanya dekhnaa hi nahin he
 That is why Panini has used the word 'observation' in Dhatworth

 The teaching of darshan is more useful for the creation and refinement of personal life

 Philosophy is able to guide us by providing light and light in the darkness with the help of proof and logic

 By philosophy we can summarize the subjects into two classes
 loukik or alokik athwa bhautik or aadhyatmik
 Darshan discusses us either about the principle of the elaborate universe, or about the soul
 is prakaar darshan ke vishay jad or chetan donon hi hai
 Since the ancient Rig Vedic period, there are some hints in our literature about the basic elements of philosophy
 neeche pramukh darshanashastron ke pratham sutara diye gayi hai jo mote taur par us darshan kii vishaywastu kaa parichay dete hai- The base elements which were seen scattered in the seed form in the Vedas emerged in the Brahmins; But there, he could not grow much by getting stuck in the copies of the vines of ritual
 aaranyakon main ye ankurit hokar upanishdon main khub pallavit hue
 The development of the philosophies which are visible to us in the Upanishads, the critics have fixed it in about two hundred years BC
 mahatma buddha se yah pracheen hai
 Not only this, scholars have also considered Sankhya, Yoga and Mimamsa as ancient to Buddha
 sambhav he ki ye darshan vartmaan rup main us samay na hon, tathaapi ve kisi rup main avashya vidyaman the
 Vaiseshika Darshan is also probably older than Buddha; Because just as in today's era, justice and Vaiseshika are considered similar systems, similarly earlier meat and Vaiseshika were considered
 buddhadarshan paddati kaa aavirbhaav isa se purv do sau varsh mana jaataa he, parantu jain darshan, buddha darshan se bhi pracheen thahartaa he
 In this confirmation, it is given proof that neither the Buddhist philosophy nor the Hindu philosophy is available in ancient Jain philosophies
 mahavir swami, jo jain sampradaay ke pravartak maane jate hai, ve bhi buddha se pracheen the
 Therefore, it is a reasonable idea for Jain philosophy to be ancient from Buddha philosophy
 bhartiya darshanon kaa aitihaasik kram nishchit karnaa kathin he
 All these different philosophies have evolved and developed almost simultaneously
 idhar-udhar tathaa bich main bhi kai kadiyaan chhin-bhinn ho gai hai
 Therefore, whatever is left, you have to take the basis of that
 is kram main shuddh aitihaasikta na hone par bhi kramik vikaas kii shrinkhalaa aadi se ant tak chalati rahi he
 Therefore, often scholars have followed this sequence
 bhartiya darshan kaa aarambh vedon se hota he
 "vedas" are the basic sources of all of Indian religion, philosophy, culture, literature etc
 aaj bhi dharmik or saanskrithik krityon ke avasar par veda-mantron kaa gayan hota he
 Many philosophical sects consider Vedas as their basis and proof
 aadhunik arth main vedon ko ham darshan ke granth nahin kah sakate
 He is a compilation of musical poems of ancient Indians
 unamem us samay ke bhartiya jivan ke anek vishyon kaa samavesh he
 Many types of philosophical ideas are also found in these songs of Vedas
 chintan ke inhen bijon se uttarkalin darshanon kii vanarajiyaan viksit hui hai
 Most of the Indian philosophies consider the Vedas to be their tributaries
 ye "aastik darshan" kehalaate hai
 Famous conspiracies are under these
 jo darshansampradaay apane ko vaidic parampara se swatantra maanate hai ve bhi kuch seemaa tak vaidic vichaardhaaraon se prabhavit hai
 The creation of the Vedas is very controversial
 praaia: pashchimi vidwaanon ne rugveda kaa rachanakaal 1500 i
pus
 se lekar 2500 i
pus
 tak mana he
 In contrast to the time of the Rigveda, 3000 BC by the evidence of Indian scholar astrology etc
 From 75000 BC Believe it
 itihaas kii vidit gatiyon ke aadhaar par in pracheen rachanaaon ke samay kaa anumaan karnaa kathin he
 It would have taken thousands of years to develop such a huge and rich literature in ancient times, no doubt
 uplabdh vaidic sahitya sampurna vaidic sahitya kaa ek chota sa ansh he
 All the literature composed in the ancient era could not have been compiled and a lot of the collected literature would have been destroyed by the invaders
 vaastavik vaidic sahitya kaa vistaar itnaa adhik tha ki uske rachanakaal kii kalpana karnaa kathin he
 Undoubtedly he must have been very ancient
 vedon ke sambandh main yah spasht karnaa aavashyak he ki quran or bible kii bhanti "veda" kisi ek granth kaa naam nahin he or na ve kisi ek manushya kii rachanaayen hai
 "vedas" is a complete literature which has a huge tradition and contains many texts
 dharmik parampara main vedon ko nity, apaurushey or ishwariya mana jaataa he
 From the historical point of view, we can consider them the creation of sages
 vedamantron ke rachnewale rishi anek hai
 Vedic literature has developed in four stages
 ye samhita, brahman, aaranyak or upanishad kehalaate hai
 The collection of mantras and hymns is called "samhita"
 rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda mantron kii samhitaayein hi hai
 They also have many branches
 in samhitaon ke mantra yajna ke avasar par devataaon kii stuti ke liye gaae jate the
 Even today, they are sung on the occasion of religious and cultural acts
 in vedamantron main indra, agni, varun, surya, som, ushaa aadi devataaon kii sangitamay stutiyaan surakshit hai
 Yajna and Devopasana were the basic forms of Vedic religion
 vedon kii bhaavana uttarkalin darshanon ke samaan sanyasapradhan nahin he
 In the Vedantras, faith in life and the euphoria of life is steeped
 jagat kii asatyata kaa vedamantron main abhas nahin he
 The Rigveda has adequate values of temporal values
 vaidic rishi devataaon se ann, dhan, santan, swasthya, dderghaayu, vijay aadi kii abhyarthna karte hai
 The mantras of the Vedas are excellent examples of the musical folklore of ancient Indians
 brahman, aaranyak or upanishad granthon main gadhy kii pradhanta he, yadhyapi unka yah gadhy bhi layayukt he
 In the Brahmin texts, the method of yajnas, their purpose, fruits etc
 is discussed
 aaranyakagranthon main aadhyatmikta kii ore jhukaav dikhaai detaa he
 As it is known by this name, these are texts of the use of vanaprasthas
 upanishdon main aadhyatmik chintan kii pradhanta he
 The Brahmins, Aranyakas and Upanishads of the four mantras of the Vedas meet separately
 shatapath, tandeya aadi brahman prasiddh or mahatvapurn hai
 Both Aranyak and Upanishads are found in the name of Aitareya, Taittiriya etc
 inke atirikt ish, ken, kath, prashn, mundak, manducya aadi pracheen upanishad bhartiya chintan ke adistrot hai
 The philosophy of the Upanishads is spiritual
 brahm kii sadhana hi upanishdon kaa mukhya lakshya he
 Brahma is also called a soul
 "aatma" vishayjagat, sharir, indriyon, man, buddhi aadi sabhi avgamy tatwon sa pare ek anirvachaneey or atindriya tatv he, jo chitswarup, anant or aanandamay he
 Being beyond all passages, it is infinite
 aparichhann or ek hone ke kaaran aatma bhedamulak jagat main manushyon ke bich aantarik abhed or advait kaa aadhaar ban saktaa he
 The soul is the true nature of man
 uskaa saakshaatkaar karke manushya man ke samast bandhanon se mukt ho jaataa he
 Maya's inexplicable power has been conceived to explain how the root world is born from the soul or Brahman for the fulfillment of monotheism
 kintu sristiwad kii apeksha atmik advaitabhaav upanishdon ke vedant kaa adhik mahatvapurn paksh he
 This monotheism is steeped in Indian culture
 darshan ke kshetra main upanishdon kaa yah brahmavaad aadi shankaracharya, ramanujacharya aadi ke uttarkalin vedant maton kaa aadhaar bana
 Being the last part of the Vedas, the Upanishads are also called "vedanta"
 upanishdon kaa abhimath hi aage chalakar vedant kaa siddhant or sampradaayon kaa aadhaar ban gaya
 The style of the Upanishads is simple and serious
 anubhav ke gambhir tatv atyant saral bhashaa main upanishdon main vyakt hue hai
 To understand them, light of experience is required
 brahm kaa anubhav hi upanishdon kaa lakshya he
 It is only through his practice
 guru kaa sampark usamen adhik sahaayak hota he
 Tenacity, ethics etc
 form the role of cultivation
 karm atmik anubhav kaa sadhak nahin he
 The Upanishads differed from the Karma-dominated Vedic religion
 sanyas, vairaygy, yoga, tap, tyaag aadi ko upanishdon main bahut mahatv diya gaya he
 In these, the source of inspiration of the rigid asceticism of the Shramana tradition appears
 tapowadi jain or buddha mat tathaa gita kaa karmyog upanishdon kii aadhyatmik bhoomi main hi ankurit hue hai
 Darshan has been a very ancient tradition in Hinduism
 vaidic darshanon main shaddarshan adhik prasiddh or pracheen hai
 The Karmaism of the Gita is also contemporary to him
 shaddarshanon ko 'aastik darshan' kaha jaataa he
 They believe in the power of Vedas
 hindu darshanik parampara main vibhinn prakaar ke aastik darshanon ke alaava anishvaravaadi or bhautikwaadi darshanik paramparaayen bhi vidyaman raheen hai

 As long as our senses are outward, meditation is never possible
 iske anusaar paramatma ke mukhya naam o3m kaa jaap na karke anya naamon se paramatma kii stuti or upasna apurna hi he
 Mimamsutra is the original book of this philosophy, whose author is Maharishi Jaimini
 is darshan main vaidic yagyon main mantron kaa viniyog tathaa yagyon kii prakriyaaon kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 If the Yoga philosophy suggests a measure of inner purification, then Mimamsa philosophy describes the duties and duties of human life from family life to national life, so that the whole nation can progress
 jis prakaar sampurna karmkand mantron ke viniyog par aadhaarit hai, usee prakaar mimasaa darshan bhi mantron ke viniyog or uske vidhaan kaa samarthan karata he
 Maharishi Jaimini has also considered Veda to be the ultimate proof for religion
 unke anusaar yagyon main mantron ke viniyog, shruti, vaakya, prakaran, sthaan evam samakhya ko moulik aadhaar mana jaataa he
 Vedanta means the ultimate principle of the Vedas
 maharishi vyas dwaara rachit brahmasutra is darshan kaa mul granth he
 This philosophy is also known as Uttar Mimamsa
 is darshan ke anusaar brahm jagat kaa karta-dharta va sanhaar karta hone se jagat kaa nimitt kaaran he

 And it is well known that Jeevatma has always been taking measures to get rid of its sufferings
 parantu brahm kaa gun isse bhinn he
 Later, many sects of Vedanta became
 shad darshanon ke alaava lokayat tathaa shaiva evam shakt darshan bhi hindu darshan ke abhinn ang hai
 Being anti-vedic, the Charvak faith is also named in the atheist sects

 upanishad kaal main ek ore buddha or jain dharmon kii avaidic paramparaon kaa aavirbhaav hua tathaa duusari ore vaidic darshanon kaa udai hua
 In the two centuries before and after the birth of Christ, parallel streams of many philosophies began to flow on the Indian land of thought

 Both Buddha and Mahavira were princes of the Himalayan region
 yuvavay main hi sanyas lekar unhone apane dharmo kaa upadesh or prachaar kiya
 His renunciation is inspired by the tradition of the Upanishads
 jain or buddha dharmon main tap or tyaag kii mahima bhi upanishdon ke dasharn ke anukool he
 These religions are characterized by non-violence and the importance of ethics and denial of caste discrimination
 ahimsa ke beej bhi upanishdon main vidyaman hai
 Nevertheless, the credit of hoisting the flag of non-violence into the sky of religion will have to be credited to Jain and Buddhist sects
