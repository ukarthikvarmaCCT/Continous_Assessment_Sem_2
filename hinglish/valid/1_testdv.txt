 01 praveshdwar The Nand Dynasty was the most powerful and great justice or barber dynasty of ancient India
 jisane paanchavin-chauthi shatabdi isa purv uttari bharat ke vishaal bhaag par shashan kiya
 Nandavansha was founded by the first Chakravarti emperor Mahapadmananda
 bhartiya itihaas main pehali baar ek aise samrajya kii sthapana hui jisaki simaaen ganga ke maidaanon ko long gai
 This empire was not actually a loose union of independent states or feudal lords but rather a powerful king force
 ye ek ekaraat kii chhatrachhaaya main ek akhand rajtantr tha, jiske paas apaar sanybal, dhanabal or janabal tha
 Chakravarti emperor Mahapadmananda conquered all the nearby dynasties and established a vast empire and implemented the system of central governance
 isiilie samraat mahapadam nand kokendriya shashan paddati kaa janak kaha jaataa he
 It is worth remembering what the kings of Nandavans donated to their heirs and future generations
 In Smith's words, "he forced 66 conflicting states not to overthrow each other and entrust themselves to a higher regulatory authority
" " ni:andeh nando ke utthan ko bhartiya raajnneeti ke utkarsh kaa pratik mana ja saktaa he
 This was confirmed in "mahananda" from the early three shlokas of the epic "krishna Charitra" composed by Emperor Samudragupta
 magar ukt mahakavy kaa vivaran maatr hi shesh he
 Samudra Vasana Shebhya: Hai Aas Mudampi Shriya:
 upaay hastera krishya:tat:shodkrut nandsaat
 
 itihaas kii jaankaree ke anek vivaran puraanon, jain or buddha granthon evam unani itihaaskaaron ke varnan main praapt hote hai
 However, it can be said with certainty that Nanda was a dynasty whose most of the nature was of the Indian rule tradition
 curtius kahata he ki sikandar ke samay shaashak kaa pita vastav main ek garib nai kaa betaa tha, unani lekhakon ke varnanon se gyaat hota he ki vah "vartmaan raja" agramas athwa jandrama tha, jisaki pahchaan dhananand se kii gai he
 His father was Mahapadmananda, which seems to be the Kshatriya varna from the appropriate statement of Curtius
 kuch puraana granth or jain granth "parishisht parvan main bhi use naapit kaa putr kaha gaya he
 Only one thing is clear from these many references that the king of Nandavans was of the justice justice Kshatriya varna
 nandavansh kaa pratham or sarvaprasiddh raja hua
 The Puranas count it only in the Shaishunag dynasty, but in the Buddhist and Jain Anushrutis it is considered the initiator of a new dynasty, which is correct
 use jain granthon main ugrasen or puraanon main mahapadmapati bhi kaha gaya he
 In the Kaliyugarajavrittantavale portions of the Puranas, it is given the nouns of Atibali, Mahakshatrantaka and and Parasurama
 spasht he, bahut badi senawale us raaj ne apane samakalik anek kshatriya rajwanshon kaa uchchhed kar apane bal kaa pradarshan kiya
 It is not surprising that with that immense wealth and military power, he undertook to conquer all the regions between the Himalayas and the Narmada
 uske jite hue pradeshen main akshvaku, paanchal, kauravy, kaashi, haihay, ashmak, vitihotra, kaling, shurasen, mithila, tathaa anya anek rajya shaamil the
 Nowhere between the Himalayas and Vindhyachal could there be a violation of his rule
 is prakaar usne sari prithvi par "ekarat, hokar rajya kiya
 The authenticity of these Puranic victories of Mahapadmananda is also proved by some scattered references to the Kathasaritsagar, the elephant cave records of Kharavel and some records from Mysore
 jain or buddha granthon se ye praapt hota hai ki mahapadmanand kii do raniyon thi rani avantika or ranimura or donon maharaniyaan hi behad sundar or khubasurat thi mahapadmanand kii raniyon ke bare main adhik jaankaree nahi milti hai The Puranas state the ten sons of Mahapadmananda as the heir
 vahaan unke naam milte hai Ganga Pal, Panduk, Pandugati, Bhootpal, Rashtrapal, Govishanak, Dashasiddhak, Kaivart and Dhananand, Chand Nand chandragupta maury nand vansh ke sasthaashak chakravarti samraat mahapadmanand ke ve putr the jinka vaastavik naam chandranand tha jinaki maa ekbrahraman parivaar se thi mahapadmanand ke baad unke putr dhananand raja hue jinke dar se sikandar bhi bhaag gaya tha
 Dhanananda beat the minister Chanakya and drove him out of the assembly, because Chanakya sat on the throne before Dhananand
 chanakya ne dhananand ke sautele bhai chandranand ko bhadakaakar dhananand ko dhokhe se chandranand se maravakar chandranand kro raja banaaya or chandranand kro chandragupta maury naam diya 
 The Sumalya of the Puranas seems to be difficult to match to any of the eight names other than Mahapadma mentioned in Buddhist texts
 kintu sabhi milakar sankhya kii drushti se navanand kahe jate the
 There is no dispute in this
 puraanon main un sabakaa rajyakaal 100 varshon tak bataaya gaya he - 88 varshon tak mahapadmanand kaa or 12 varshon tak uske putron kaa
 But the same person continued to rule for 88 years and subsequent successive 8 kings should rule only for 12 years, it does not seem wise
 sinhalai anushrutiyon main navanandon kaa rajyakaal 40 varshon kaa bataaya gaya he or use ham sahi maan sakate hai
 Accordingly, the Nawanandas circa 364 BC
 From 324 BC Ruled until

 Plutarch says that Chandragupta Maurya met Alexander and spoke of his lowliness and unpleasantness in public
 sambhav he, dhananand ko ukhaad phenkane ke liye chandragupta ne us videshi akramanakari ke upyog kaa bhi praytn kiya ho
 It is known from the "mahavanshatika" that the last Nanda was a harsh ruler and a person of greedy and scrupulous nature
 sambhavat: is lobhi prakruti ke kaaran hi use dhananand kaha gaya
 He also insulted Chanakya
 isaki pushti mudrarakshas naatak se hoti he, jisase gyaat hota he ki chanakya apane pad se hataa diya gaya tha
 Humiliated, he took the oath of annihilation of the Nanda Empire and with the support of Prince Chandragupta Maurya, he succeeded in that task
 un donon ne us kaary ke liye punjab ke kshetron se ek vishaal sena taiyaar kii, jisamen sambhavat: kuch videshi tatv or lutere vyakti bhi shaamil the
 It is also known that Chandragupta had made a treaty with Parvatak in the overthrow of Dhanananda

8 ° c methane and rubber when exposed to main solvent Its element is dangerous prakruti abhiprerit nirmaan vigyaan kii ek aisi naveen vidha he, jo ki puri tarah se prakritik rachanaaon dwaara prerit hoti he
 It would be more appropriate to call it a scientific approach rather than calling it a new genre
 abhiyantriki, aadhunik praudyogiki or dainik jivan main is avadharana kaa vyapak upyog hota he
 Nature is not only a source of resources for us but also a source of inspiration
 prakruti abhiprerit nirmaan kii avadharana koi nai nahin he
 Its application as a scientific discipline is certainly new
 isaki avadharana kaa upyog prakruti kii sanrachanaon or isaki kriyavidhi ko adarsh maanate hue kisi bhi kritrim nirmaan yaa kisi bhi ghatana kii vyakhya karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 It has been observed that models or instruments that are based on a natural component or structure prove to be far more effective and useful than conventional models or instruments
 prakruti kii koi bhi sanrachana anek tarah ke balon or utparivartanaatmak prakriya ke fal swaroop banati he
 The constant exchange of atmospheric components is responsible for its re-transformation
 baar baar hone vaala yah parivartan aage ek nayi rachana ko janm detaa he
 This composition expresses the meaning of nature
 sankshep main kaha jaae to prakruti kii kisi bhi rachana main nirarthakta nahin hoti he or yah rachana satat hone vaale parivartanon ke liye grahya bhi hoti he
 Human's excellent intellectual ability embodied this unprecedented theory of engineering and started its application in daily life
 kya ek pattee kii jaiviki kaa adhyayan ek parishkrut saura urja cell ke nirmaan main sahaayak ho saktaa he? hari pattiyon main hone vaali prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya urja roopantaran or sanchayan kaa sarvottam udhaaharan he
 This is also done by solar energy batteries but there is a difference in efficiency and efficiency of both
 ek baat or he
 There is a lot of difference between learning about nature and learning from nature
 prakruti ko dekhne kii duusari drushti bhi he
 If we look at it as a guru and ideal then we will find that 3
8 billion years of experience of mutation and sustainable development is available before us
 kya cheez anuprayog main laai ja sakati he or sristi ke vikaas main koun si chije mahatvaheen hai
 How important compositions are encouraged and how insignificant creations gradually disappear
 yah sab kuch hamen yahaan seekhney ko miltaa he
 Natural selection and the occurrence of survival and adaptation of the fittest is a good example of this
 prakruti abhiprerit nirmaan ke kuch apane siddhant bhi hai
 Any construction can be said to be genuinely motivated by nature only when it meets certain circumstances
 aise ek adarsh nirmaan ke nimnlikhit siddhant hote hai
 Three methods of nature-inspired construction are used in an application form
 ham apane aas paas dekhen to hamen aise anek udhaaharan mil jaaenge jahaan in vidhiyon kaa prayog karte hue koi nirmaan kiya gaya he
 In 1445, Leonardo da Vinci first conceived the flying instrument by pictures
 unhone pakshiyon kii shaareerik sanrachana or inke udne kii vidhiyon kaa sookshm nirikshan kiya or iske aadhaar par parachute or jahaaj ke vividh chitra banaae
 His illustrations are excellent examples of nature inspired vision
 ek aisa hi udhaaharan smart kapadon ke sambandh main diya ja saktaa he
 Its investigator was inspired by some plants of the conifer species
 aise paudhe ek vishesh taapmaana range main khulkar apane bijon kaa prakirnan karte hai
 The fibers induced by this biological process were adapted to heat
 aise kapadon ke reshe kam taapmaana hone par band ho jate hai or adhik taapmaana main khul jate hai
 Another example is based on a feature of lotus flower called water lotus relationship
 camel ke phool or patton par pani nahin thahartaa or ye jal main rah kar bhi nahin bheegate or svachh rahete hai
 Keeping this special property in mind, a new type of paint was made, which has the property of being self-cleaning
 isi tarah se abhi haal hi main ek vishesh tarah ke chipkaane vaale tepe kii khoj kii gai he
 No glue is used in this tape
 vaigyanikon ko ise banane kii prerana ek tarah ke sarisrup geko se mili
 The soles of this reptile have microscopic brush-like structures, due to which it does not slip through the walls and moves comfortably
 ek duusare udhaaharan main kingfisher pakshi kii sanrachana ko dhyaan main rakh kar hawa se bilkul kam pratirodh karne vaali japan kii bullate train kii sanrachana nirdhaarit kii gai
 Scientists looked at the nose of the train like a kingfisher's choke and found that now the resistance to air seems to be minimal
 jaev abhiprerana ke aadhaar kar ek company ke sanghathan or kriyavidhi kii vyakhya kii ja sakati he
 If we consider a company as an organism which is a part of an economic ecosystem, then we will see that its relationship with other organisms companies represents a kind of symbiosis
 yahaan bhi yogyatam kii uttarjivita or anukulan ke siddhant lagu hote hai
 The field of engineering and construction in particular has immense potential
 naye ubharate kshetra ke rup main isane vaigyanikon or shikshavidon kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya he
 Nature inspired products are popular and far better than other products due to their properties such as work and energy efficiency, environmentally friendly and accessible
 vartmaan parivesh main jabaki puraa vishwa paryaavaran sankat se jujh rahaa he
 In this case, these products can be more useful due to their biological balance
 or bhi kuch nimnlikhit kaaran hai joki prakruti aadhaarit nirmaan ko protsaahit karte hai
 Sustainable development is discussed in environmental science
 iske anusaar hamaari yah jimmedaari he ki ham prithvi par uplabdh sansadhano kaa aise prayog kare ki yah vartmaan kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne ke saath saath bhavishya ke liye bhi uplabdh ho tathaa har sthiti main paryaavaran sangrakshan ke anuroop ho
 In such a situation, we see that bio-inspired constructions can be helpful in this to a great extent
 yah sarvamaanya he ki prakruti main pehle se hi un anek samasyaon kaa samaadhaan he jinhen ham hal karne kaa abhi tak prayaas hi kar rahen hai
 The only thing that is needed is to broaden your vision
 yadi hamen is prakritik bauddhikta kaa sarvottam upyog karnaa he to hamen sabase pehle apni us vichaardhaara ko tyaagna hoga jisamen ham ise sansadhano kaa strot maatr maanate hai or iske sandohan ke liye ek had tak pagal bane rahete hai

 yah or adhik manyata praapt thi ki olympic khelon ke ek yuva sanskaran olympic khelon main paalkon ko badhaava dene main madad karegaa
 Despite these reasons for the young people to be an Olympic event, the ioc's reaction to being a purely sporting event was negative
 iosi pratinidhiyon ne yah kaarykram khel ke bare main jitna zyada saanskrithik shiksha or vinimay ke rup main karnaa chaahate the, yahi vajah he ki samskruti or shiksha kaarykram ko khelon ke prayek utsav ke ek ghatak ke rup main viksit kiya gaya

 This triggered a sequence in which the main solid rockets played their part to take the spacecraft up, and the smaller rockets later carried it toward the ocean
 launch palaayan system ko 15 second ke baad alag kiya gaya, jisase antarikshayan belistic prakshepvakr main gati karne laga
 The parachute system worked perfectly: the drug shoots stabilized the spacecraft, then the three main parachutes accelerated the spacecraft's fall to 26 kmph

 Therefore, it is necessary that the plowing should be done from the center to the shore for the second time, so that the field becomes flat

 Bakhar is used more in Bundelkhand, Madhya Pradesh etc
, because the land there cannot be plowed due to the soil being wet and wet during the rainy season
 at: kharpatvaar bhi adhik ho jate hai
 If this land cannot be plowed only after proper humidity, then it becomes hard
 bakkhar se adhik kshetrafal jut sakane ke kaaran, yah kaary thode samay main sampann kiya ja saktaa he or bhoomi ko kadaa hone se bachaaya ja saktaa he
 From this, weeding of crops sown in rows can be done
 isamen jutai ke liye gandaase kii bhanti kaa lohe kaa fal laga rahata he, jisaki chaudaai or lambaai aavashyaktaanusaar kam yaa adhik rakhte hai
 It plows two to three inches deep
 yah bhi ek prakaar kaa kaltiwaitor he, parantu isen pahiyaa nahin rahata
 Like this cultivator, this device is also very useful for leveling the field after plowing or cultivator, for breaking the slopes and plowing grass

 'rek ho' bhi papadi todane, ghaas aadi ekatrit karne ke liye upyukt hai
 Various efforts have been made in the spelling of Hindi spelling since the late 19th century
 isi taratamya main kendriya hindi nideshaalay dwaara varsh 2003 main devanagari lipi tathaa hindi vartanee ke maanakeekaran ke liye akhil bhartiya sangoshtee kaa aayojan kiya tha
 In this seminar the following rules were laid down for standard Hindi spelling which has been implemented in the year 2012 as IS / IS 16500: 2012
 vartmaan samay main maanak hindi vartanee kaa kaaryakshetra kendriya hindi nideshaalay kaa he
 Many veterans have made their contribution towards standardization of Hindi spelling, out of which the names of Acharya Kishoridas Vajpayee and Acharya Ramchandra Varma are notable
 hindi bhashaa ke sangh or kuch rajyon kii rajbhasha sweekrut ho jane ke falswaroop desh ke bheetar or baahar hindi seekhney waalon kii sankhya main paryaapt vruddhi ho jane se hindi vartanee kii maanak paddati nirdhaarit karnaa aavashyak or kalochit laga, taaki hindi shabdon kii vartaneeyon main adhikadhik ekarupata laai ja sake
 Accordingly, the Ministry of Education, Government of India appointed an Expert Committee in 1961 to determine the standard method of Hindi spelling
 is samiti ne april 1962 main antim report di
 The committee had four meetings in which after serious deliberation a rule regarding spelling was laid down

 varsh 1983 main is pustika kaa ni:shulk sanshodhit evam parivardhit sanskaran “devanagari lipi tathaa hindi vartanee kaa maanakeekaran” prakashit kiya gaya
 In view of the ever increasing demand of this booklet, it was reprinted in the year 1989 and free distribution was made in various Hindi service institutions, offices, educational institutions to increase the use of standard form of Hindi in more and more institutions

 In this context, the All India Seminar was organized by the Central Hindi Directorate in the year 2003 for standardization of Devanagari script and Hindi spelling
 is sangoshtee main maanak hindi vartanee ke liye jo niyam nirdhaarit kiye gayi the unka vivaran neeche diya gaya he
 In the book "standardization of Devanagari script and Hindi spelling", the standard Hindi alphabet, standard Hindi spelling, punctuation, alphabets in lexicons, enhanced Devanagari script, etc
, are related to the division and subdivision of topics and paragraphs

 tippanee : sanskrit bhashaa ke mul shlokon ko uddhrut karte samay sanyuktakshar puraani style se bhi likhe ja sakenge
 Such as - Joint, Icon, Learning, Scholar, Older, Second, Wisdom etc
 kintu yadi inhen bhi uparyukt niyamon ke anusaar hi likhaa jaae to koi aapatti nahin hogi
 2
2
1 Signs of Hindi should be written separately from the primary in all noun words
 jaise :– ram ne, ram ko, ram se, stri kaa, stri se, seva main aadi
 In pronoun words, these signs should be written together with the phrase
 jaise :– tuune, aapane, tumse, usne, usko, usase, usapar aadi 
 2
2
2 If two factors are marked with the pronoun, the first of them should be combined and the second written separately
 jaise :– uske liye, isamen se
 2
2
3 If there is a collision between the pronoun and the causative mark 'he', 'even', etc
, the causative mark should be written separately
 jaise :– aap hi ke liye, mujh tak ko
 All conjunctive verbs should be written separately in joint verb terms
 jaise :– padhaa karata he, aa saktaa he, jaaya karata he, khaaya karata he, ja saktaa he, kar saktaa he, kiya karata tha, padhaa karata tha, khelaa karegaa, ghumta rahegaa, badhate chale ja rahe hai aadi

3 tatpurush samaas main hifan kaa prayog keval vahiin kiya jaae jahaan uske bina bhram hone kii sambhaavna ho, anyathaa nahin
 Such as: - Earth element
 saamanyat: tatpurush samaas main hifan lagane kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Such as - Ramrajya, Rajkumar, Gangajal, villagers, suicide etc
 2
4
3
1 isi tarah yadi 'a-nikh' samast pad main hifan na lagaaya jaae to use 'anakh' padhe jane se 'krodh' kaa arth bhi nikal saktaa he
 a-nati: Anati, a-paras: Aperus, Geo-element: Bhootmata, etc
 is the same situation for all the posts
 ye sabhi yugma vartanee or arth donon drushtiyon se bhinn-bhinn shabd hai
 2
4
4 Hyphens can also be used to avoid difficult treaties
 jaise :– dwi-akshar, dwi-arthak aadi
 2
5
1 'always', 'with' etc
 are always written separately
 jaise :– yahan tak, aapke saath
 2

2 Ah, oh, aha, ai, hee, so, so, too, neither, when, then, when, here, there, where, forever, what, sri, ji, till, across, mere, with , But, but, but, whether, or, or, and, as and etc
 are imprecise to explain many types of expressions
 kuch avyayon ke aage kaarak chihn bhi aate hai
 Like: - From now on, since, from here, from there, forever
 niyam ke anusaar avyay sadaa pruthak likhe jane chahie
 Such as: - For you only, till me, with you, full of cloth, country, overnight, all day, it should be so full, let me know, even work is not made, only fifty rupees etc
 2
5
3 sammanarthak 'shri' or 'ji' avyay bhi pruthak likhe jaaen
 Such as Shri Shri Ram, Kanhaiyalal ji, Mahatma ji etc
 2
5
4 samast padon main prati, maatr, yatha aadi avyay jodakar likhe jaaen 
 Such as - per day, percentage, man-man, constant, in due time, reasonably etc
 yah sarvavidit niyam he ki samaas na hone par samast pad ek mana jaataa he
 Therefore, it is relevant to write it together rather than writing it in busy form
 'das rupye maatr', 'maatr do vyakti' main padbandh kii rachana he
 It should be written separately only
 2
6
0 anuswaar vyanjan he or anunasikta swar kaa nasiky vikaar
 Both of these are also different in Hindi
 at hindi main anuswaar or anunasikta chihn donon hi prachlit rahenge
 2
6
1 reminders 2

1
1 sanskrit shabdon kaa anuswaar anyavargeey varnon se pehle yathavat rahegaa
 Such as - coincidence, protection, attachment, dialogue, kansa, violence etc

2 sanyukt vyanjan ke rup main jahaan pancham varna ke baad savargeey shesh chaar varnon main se koi varna ho to ekarupata or mudran / lekhan kii suvidha ke liye anuswaar kaa hi prayog karnaa chahie
 Such as - Pankaj, Ganga, Chanchal, Stingy, Kantha, Chill, Saint, Sandhya, Temple, Editor, Relations etc
 bandhani main rakhe hue rup sanskrit ke uddharanon main hi maanya honge
 It is advisable to use Bindi in Hindi
 2

3 yadi panchamakshar ke baad kisi anya varg kaa koi varna aae to panchamakshar anuswaar ke rup main parivartit nahin hoga
 Such as: - Eloquent, other, Chinmaya, oriented etc

2
1 Proper use of Chandrabindu in Hindi words will be mandatory
 2
6
2
2 anunasikta vyanjan nahin he, swaron kaa dhvanigun he
 In the pronunciation of resonant vowels, air also comes out of the nose
 jaise :– aan, uun, en, maan, hoon, aaen
 2
6
2
3 Without Chandrabindu there is often scope for confusion in meaning
 jaise :– hans : hans, angana : anganaa, swang : swaang aadi main
 Therefore, Chandrabindu must be used to clear such confusion
 kintu jahaan chandrabindu ke prayog se chapai aadi main bahut kathinaayee ho or chandrabindu ke sthaan par bindu kaa prayog kisi prakaar kaa bhram utpann na kare, vahaan chandrabindu ke sthaan par bindu ke prayog kii chhot rahegi
 Like: - No, I, etc
 kavita aadi ke prasang main chand kii drushti se chandrabindu kaa yathasthaan avashya prayog kiya jaae
 Similarly, in the entrances of young children, where the chandrabindu is pronounced, it should be used everywhere in thick letters
 jaise :– kahan, hansnaa, aangan, sanvaarana, main, main, nahin aadi
 2
7
1 If Sanskrit words are used in Visarga, if they are used in the corresponding form, then Visarga must be used
 jaise :– ‘duhkhanubhuti’ main
 If Visarga has been omitted in the form of that word, then without Visarga in that form it will work
 jaise :– ‘dukh-sukh ke saathi’
 2
7
2 It is mandatory to use the used clause at the end of corresponding words
 yatha :– atah, punah, swatah, praayah, purnatah, multah, antat, vastutah, kramshah aadi
 2
7
3 The dissimilar form of 'H' is immersion, so Ghosh 'H' should not be written in its place
 2
7
4 dubsahas / dussahas, nihshabd / nishshabd ke ubhay rup maanya honge
 In these, the preferred form should be given priority
 2
7
4
1 nistej, nirvachan, nishchal aadi shabdon main visarg vaala rup na likhaa jaae
 2
7
4
2 The words conscience, antipura, morning etc
 should be written with visarga
 2
7
5 tadbhav / deshi shabdon main visarg kaa prayog na kiya jaae
 It would be wrong to write six on this basis
 chah likhnaa hi thik hoga
 2
7
6 The words peninsweep, termination, etc
 are also not dissonant in the corresponding form
 2
7
7 visarg ko varna ke saath milakar likhaa jaae, jabaki colon chihn shabd se kuch duuri par ho
 Like: - So, this is how: - 2
8
1 ko hal chihn kaha jaae na ki halant
 The light mark under the consonant indicates that the consonant is void, ie the consonant is purely consonant
 is tarah se 'jagat' halant shabd kaha jayega kyonki yah shabd vyanjanant he, swarant nahin
 2
8
2 According to Rule 2
1
2
2 of making conjunctions, only the markings will be used in the thumbnail
 jaise : chihn, buddha, vidwaan aadi main
 2
8
3 When the use of corresponding words is desirable, only halant forms should be used; Especially when all words or derived words are formed from them
 yatha prak :–, vaak-, sat-, bhagwan-, saakshaat-, jagat-, tejas-, vidyut- aadi
 In the corresponding address, only Rajan, o Lord, will be accepted
 hindi style main he raja, he bhagwaan likhe jaaen
 In words in which the hallmark has been lost, do not attempt to reinstate it
 jaise - mahaan, vidwaan aadi; kyonki hindi main ab 'mahaan' se 'mahanata' or 'vidwaanon' jaise rup prachlit ho chuke hai
 2
8
4 In grammar texts, only those words which are necessary to understand the word structure or are useful in terms of meaning are given to explain consonant conjunctions
 2
8
5 hindi main hrydayngam, uddhran, sanchit aadi shabdon kaa sandhi-viched samajhane kii aavashyaktaa prathit nahin hoti
 Similarly, there is a need to explain the meaning of words like 'interview', 'jagdish', 'hexkosh' only when their treaty is cited
 hindi main inhen swatantra shabdon ke rup main grahan karnaa hi acha hoga
 2
9
1 The spelling of Sanskrit-friendly words should be taken as-is
 at: 'brahma' ko 'bramha', 'chihn' ko 'chinh', 'urin' ko 'urin' main badalanaa uchit nahin hoga
 Similarly, imprudence, sight, exhibition, excess, trespass etc
 are not acceptable inaccurate usage
 inke sthaan par kramash: gruhit, drashtavy, pradarshnee, atyadhik, anadhikaar hi likhnaa chahie
 2
9
2 The corresponding words in which a consonant consonant has disappeared in the event of a combination of three consonants is not allowed to be written
 jaise :– arddh > ardh, tatva > tatv aadi
 2
10
1 Ai, au in Hindi is used to express two types of pronunciation
 pehle prakaar kaa uccharan 'he', 'or' aadi main mul swaron kii tarah hone laga he; jabaki duusare prakaar kaa uccharan 'gavaiya', 'kauwa' aadi shabdon main sandhyaksharon ke rup main aaj bhi surakshit he
 These signs should be used to express both types of utterances
 'gavayya', 'kavva' aadi sanshodhano kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Other examples are: Bhaiya, Syed, Ready, Hawa etc
 2
10
2 dakshin ke ayyar, nayyar, ramayya aadi vyaktinaamon ko hindi uccharan ke anusaar aiyar, naiyar, ramaiya aadi na likhaa jaae, kyonki mulbhasha main iskaa uccharan bhinn he
 2
10
3 Words like avwal, qawwal, qawwali are prevalent
 inhen lekhan main yathavat rakhaa jaae
 2
10
4 In Sanskrit, the word 'bed' should not be written as 'shaya'
 2
11
1 purvakalik kridant pratyay 'kar' kriya se milakar likhaa jaae
 Such as: - By mixing, eating and drinking, crying and etc
 2
11
2 kar + kar se 'karke' or kara + kar se 'karake' banegaa
 2
12
1 In verb forms 'doer', 'coming', 'talker' etc
 should be written separately
 jaise :– main ghar jane vaala hoon, jane vaale log
 2
12
2 'gharwala', 'topiwala', Dilwala, Dudhwala etc
 will be written as one word in the form of additive suffix
 2
12
3 'vaala' jab pratyay ke rup main aayega tab to 2
12
2 ke anusaar milakar likhaa jayega; anyathaa alag se
 This is the directive word in this one, this one, the first one, the good one, the red one, the tomorrow one, etc
 atah ise alag hi likhaa jaae
 Similarly, the words with long hair girl, bearded man etc
 will be written separately
 isse ham rachana ke str par antar kar sakate hai
 Such as: -gaonwala - villager village house - village house 2
13
1 jahaan shrutimulak ya, va kaa prayog vikalp se hota he vahaan na kiya jaae, arthath kiye : kiye, nai : nayi, hua : huwa aadi main se pehle roopon kaa prayog kiya jaae
 This rule should be applied in all forms and situations of the verb, adjective, avayya etc
 jaise :– dikhaae gaye, ram ke liye, pustak liye hue, nai dilli aadi
 2
13
2 Where 'Y' is not the grammatical change but only the basic element of the word, there is no need to make optional dictative emotional change
 jaise :– sthaayee, avyayibhav, daayitv aadi 
 The words of arabic-persian origin from Urdu which have become a part of Hindi and whose foreign sounds have been converted into Hindi sounds can be accepted in Hindi only
 jaise :– kalam, kila, daag aadi 
 But where their pure use in foreign form is desired or it is necessary to state the accent, there should be in-place nukes in their prevalent forms in Hindi
 jaise :– khaanaa : kaanaa, raaj : raaj, fan : fan aadi
 In English words, where the semicircular 'O' sound is used, if the pure form is used in Hindi, the crescent moon should be used over the quantity of 'A'
 jahaan tak angrezi or anya videshi bhashaaon se nae shabd grahan karne or unke devanagari lipyantaran kaa sambandh he, agast-sitambar, 1962 main vaigyanik tathaa takneekee shabdaawalee ayog dwaara vaigyanik shabdaawalee par yojit bhashavidon kii sangoshtee main antarrashtriya shabdaawalee ke devanagari lipyantaran ke sambandh main kii gai sifaarish ullekhneey he
 It states that Devanāgarī transliteration of English words should not be so eloquent that many new signs have to be added to its present Devanāgarī characters
 angrezi shabdon kaa devanagari lipyantaran maanak angrezi uccharan ke adhik-se-adhik nikat hona chahie
 There are some popular words in Hindi that have two forms of spelling being the same
 vidvatsamaj main donon roopon kii ek-si manyata he
 Some examples are: neck / neck, heat / heat, ice / ice, absolutely / absolutely, cold / cold, pedestal / chair, conscription / recruitment, leisure / leisure, tolerance / tolerance, back / back, finally / finally, utensils / Utensils, again / again, shop / shop, sickness / disease etc
 in vaikalpik roopon main se pehle vaale rup ko praathamikta di jaae
 For details see - Appendix 4 2
15
1 shirorekha kaa prayog prachlit rahegaa
 2
15
2 Except for fullstop, the rest of the punctuation marks are the same as those prevalent in English
 yatha :– -, –, :–, , ;, :, ?, !, ', " ", ' ' 
, { },, 


, / 
 For detailed rules, see Appendix - 5 2
15
3 visarg ke chihn ko hi colon kaa chihn maan liya gaya he
 But the difference has been made between the two that Visarga should be at a distance from the word and colon
 2
15
4 purna viraam ke liye khadi pai kaa hi prayog kiya jaae
 Not the point at the end of the sentence
 
 According to the present tense grammatical definition, the form of a verb which indicates the presence of a situation or an event in the present time is called 'present tense'
 angrezi main, iskaa prayog vartmaan main ho rahi koi kriya, yaa koi sthiti, yaa bhavishya main hone vaali koi ghatana, yaa koi aisi kriya jo bhoot kaal main shuru hui ho or vartmaan main bhi jari ho darshane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Two common types of present tense are found in most indo-european languages: present indicative and present subjunctive
 angrezi bhashaa ke vartmaan kaal ko boli ke nimnlikhit pahaluon ke saath prayog kiya ja saktaa he: In the simple present tense, verb words in English are used without the ending, but after the other masculine pronouns used in the singular, she, it, your friend, etc
) suffix -s or -es are added to the end of the verb
 is saral vartmaan kaal ko akasar samay se sambandhit kriya visheshan ke saath prayog kiya jaataa he, jaisaa ki in udaahranon main tirchhe aksharon main likhe kriya visheshan: Romance languages are derived from the Latin language, especially the Western 'vulgar Latin'
 parinamswaroop unki upyogita or rup-rachana main bhi samanta hoti he
 In the Latin language, the present tense can be represented as progressive or simple
 nimnlikhit shabd kriyaaroop latin bhashaa main vartmaan suchak kaal ke udhaaharan hai
 In French, the present tense is used in the same way as in English
 neeche die shabd kriyaaroop francisi bhashaa main vartmaan kaal ke udhaaharan hai
 Expressions such as "en train de" or "en cours de" can be used to express present continuous
 udhaaharan ke liye, Jean est en train de' manger, kaa angrezi anuwaad hoga John is eating', yaa 'john is in the middle of eating' 
 On est en train de chercher un nouvel appartement kaa angrezi anuwaad hoga We are looking for a new apartment, we are in the process of finding a new apartment 
 In Portuguese, the present tense is used almost exactly like the Spanish language
 yahaan die shabd kriyaaroop portugali bhashaa main vartmaan suchak kaal ke udhaaharan hai
 In Spanish, the present tense is used in the same way as English
 yahaan die shabd kriyaaroop spanish bhashaa main vartmaan suchak kaal ke udhaaharan hai
 It is important to clarify that vostros and ustedes mean the same and that the Spanish language spoken in Latin America sometimes uses ustedes instead of vostros
 balgerian bhashaa main, apurna kriya pad ke vartmaan suchak kaal kaa prayog angrezi main hone vaale istemaal se bahut miltaa-julata he
 It can also be used as a present progressive
 neeche die shabd kriyaaroop balgerian bhashaa main vartmaan suchak kaal ke udhaaharan hai
 * Used in ancient language, noun is not available in modern language
 mysidonian bhashaa main apurna kriya padon ke istemaal se vartmaan kaal banataa he
 The table below gives examples of how to write, speak, love and open verb terms
 finish bhashaa main, kriya pad main sarvanaamon kaa apana hi alag samaapan hota he

 saamaajik manovigyaan kii prakruti vaigyanik he
 When we say any subject as scientific, it has certain characteristics, and along with those characteristics, there are various methods under the study of that subject, which are used in the study of related subjects
 Baron and Don Byrne have stated these characteristics or visual values in this way, to be a scientist of any subject they are necessary- yatharthata Subjectivity sanshayvadita or Neutrality
 in chaaron ko spasht karte hue unka kahana he ki - yatharthata se abhipraay duniya ke bare main yathasambhav saavdhaneepurvak, spasht va trutirahit tareeke se jaankaree hasil karne evam muulyankan karne ke prati vachanabaddhata se he

 It is through social psychology that one gets real information related to the relation between culture and personality, socialization, learning process, social behavior, individual variations, ecological behavior, memory, orientation, leadership, etc
