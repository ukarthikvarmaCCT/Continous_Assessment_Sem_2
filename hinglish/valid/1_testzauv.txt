 Early e-learning systems based on computer-based learning / trainees often attempted to replicate autocratic teaching styles so that the role of the e-education system evolved later on the basis of computer-supported collaborative learning that encouraged the shared development of knowledge
 Transfer of knowledge against systems was considered

 There is a tendency to move towards blended learning services where computer-based activities are integrated with practical or classroom-based situations

 This classification is somewhat similar to the Sloan Commission's report classification based on the state of e-education, which refers to web-enhanced, web-complementary and web-based learning to reflect the increasing intensity of technology use
 bets evam pool ke satatyak main, 'mishrit shiksha' main kaksha sahaayta, laptop evam sankar shiksha samahit ho saktaa he, jabaki 'vitarit shiksha' main yaa to sankar yaa sampoorn rup se online shiksha shaamil ho saktaa he
 So it can be seen that e-education can describe a wide range of applications and it is not even clear in peer reviewed research publications what kind of e-education is being discussed
 haalanki, bets evam pool kaa tark he ki jab anudeshak yah kehete hai ki ve i-shiksha kaa istemaal kar rahe hai, to yah aksar zyaadaatar kaksha sahaayta ke rup main praudyogiki ke upyog ko hi sanderbhit karata he, haalanki samay ke saath sampoorn online shiksha main ek kramik vruddhi bhi hui he 
 Computer-based learning, sometimes abbreviated as CBL, refers to the use of computers as a core component of the educational environment

 This concept is generally seen as distinct from the use of computers in ways where education is at least a peripheral element of experience

 isi vajah se inkaa istemaal aksar sthir prakriyaaon ko sikhaane ke liye kiya jaataa he, jaise - software kaa istemaal karnaa yaa ganitiya sameekaran ko puraa karnaa
 In terms of interchangeability, computer-based trainee nouns are often used with web-based trainees, whose primary difference is their delivery method
 jahaan sibiti ko aam taur par sidi-rome ke madhyam se vitarit kiya jaataa he, vahiin dablubity ko ek web brouzar kaa istemaal kar internet ke madhyam se vitarit kiya jaataa he
 In CBT, the assessment of education appears as multiple choice questions or other assessment that can be easily typed by a computer, such as a drag and drop, radial button, simulation or other interactive means
 ant-upyogkarta kii tatkaal pratikriya evam purnataa kii sthiti kii soochna pradaan kar moolyankan ko online software ke madhyam se aasaani se ankit or darj kiya ja saktaa he
 Users are often able to print perfect records in the form of credentials
 sibiti pathyapustak, niyampustika, yaa kaksha-aadhaarit shiksha ke paaramparik shiksha paddatiyon se kaaphi alag tarah kii shiksha prerana pradaan karte hai
 For example, cbts provide a user-friendly solution for satisfactory fulfillment of continuing education needs
 chaatro ko paathyakram main bhaag lene yaa mudrit niyampustikaon ko padhane se simit karne ke bajaay, chaatr un tareekon ke madhyam se gyaan or kaushal praapt karne main sakasham hote hai jo vyaktigat shiksha variyataon ke liye bahut adhik anukool hote hai
 For example, cbts provide visual education benefits through animation or video, which are typically not achieved by any other means
 sibiti mudrit shiksha samagriyon kaa ek acha vikalp ho saktaa he kyonki shiksha main vruddhi karne ke liye video yaa anemeshan samet sampann madhyam ko badi aasaani se antahsthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 Another advantage of CBT is that once the initial development work is completed, they can be easily distributed to a wider audience at a relatively low cost
 haalanki, sibiti saath main kuch shiksha chunautiyon ko bhi janm detii hai
 Generally, the creation of effective CBT requires considerable resources
 sibiti yaa adob diarector ) ko viksit karne ke liye istemaal kiya jane vaala software aksar ek vishay-vastu visheshgy yaa shikshak kii upyog kshamta kii tulana main adhik jatil hota he
 Furthermore, the lack of human interaction may limit the type of content that can be presented as well as the type of evaluation that can be demonstrated
 kai shiksha sanghathan ek vyapak online program ke bhaag ke rup main chote-chote sibiti / dablubity gatividhiyon kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar rahe hai jisamen online charchaa yaa anya sanvadatmak tatv shaamil ho sakate hai
 Computer-assisted collaborative learning is one of the most promising innovations to improve teaching and education with the help of modern information and communication technology
 siessiel main sabase haal main kiye gaye vikaason ko i-larning 2
0 kehete hai, lekin shiksha kaaryon par ekasaath kaam karne ke liye chaatro ko protsaahit karne yaa use aavashyak banane ke liye anudeshaatmak vidhiyon ko dizin karne main madad karne vaale sahyogaatmak yaa samuhik shiksha kii avadharana bahut lambe samay se astitv main rahi he
 There is a broad consensus among people that collaborative learning differs from the traditional 'direct transfer' model in that the instructor is considered a distributor of knowledge and skills, often named neoism e-learning 1
0, even though this direct transfer method Demonstrates computer-based education systems most accurately
 datacloud: toverd e new theory of online work main jondan johnson-ilola ek vishisht computer-samarthit sahyog sthaan: da smart board kaa varnan karte hai
 According to johnson-ilola, a "smart board system provides a 72-inch, rear projection, touchscreen, efficient whiteboard surface for work"
 datacloud main, johnson-ilola is baat par jor dete hai ki "humlog yah samajhane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai ki upyogkarta soochna sthal ke bheetar kaise sthaan parivartan karte hai, upyogkarta kaise keval unhen nihaarne ke bajaay soochna sthalon ke bheetar maujuud rah sakate hai or kaise soochna sthanon ko apane tak hi simit rakhane ke bajaay anya logon ke saath share kar diya janaa chahie, jo keval darshan karne ke bajaay usamen nivas karte the 
 He explains how the smart board system provides an information space that allows its students to engage in active collaboration
 vah is praudyogiki kii kaaryakshmata ke bare main teen alag-alag daawey karte hai: 1) yah smart board pranali, upyogkartaaon ko bahut adhik soochna ke saath kaam karne kii anumati pradaan karti he, 2) yah ek soochna sthaan pradaan karti he jo sakriy sahyog ko aamantrit karata he, 3) utpann kaary aksar "gatyaatmak evam aakasmik" hote hai 
johnson-ilola aage bataate hai ki smart board ke saath "


soochna kaary ek sasharir anubhav ban jaataa he" 
 This gives users the opportunity to engage with technology through direct manipulation
 iske alaava, yah sthaan ek se adhik upyogkartaaon ko anumati pradaan karata he; multah: yah ekaadhik upyogkartaaon ko aamantrit karata he
 The goal of technology-enhanced education is to provide socio-technical innovations for e-education methods, free of time, space and speed, related to individuals and organizations

 The advantage of such tools is that it provides the presenter with the ability to reveal the flow of his or her thoughts and ideas rather than merely interpreting them
 yadi ve pehle kii tarah keval inaki vyakhya karen, to inhen saral paath nirdeshon ke madhyam se vitarit karne par yah kaaphi bhraamak ho saktaa he
 Combining video and audio, experts can mimic the classroom experience one-on-one and provide clear, complete instructions
 shikshaarthiyon ke nazariye se dekhne par pataa chalata he ki yah upyogkartaaon ko inhen kuch der ke liye rokane or phir use shuru karne kii kshamta pradaan karata he or shikshaarthi ko apni khud kii chaal par sthanantarit hone kaa laabh bhi pradaan karata he, yah kuch aisi chizein hai jise ek kaksha hameshaa pradaan nahin kar sakati he
 Communication technologies are generally classified as asynchronous or synchronous
 atulykaalik gatividhiyaan blog, viki or vichaar-vimarsh board jaisi praudyogikiyon kaa upyog karti hai
 The idea here is that participants can engage in exchanging ideas or information without the dependence of other participants involved at the same time
 electronic mail bhi atulykaalik hi hota he jisamen ek hi samay donon pratibhaagiyon kii bhagidaari ke bina hi mail bheja yaa praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Synchronous activities involve the exchange of ideas and information with one or more participants during the same time period

 Synchronous activities take place with all participants joining immediately, such as an online chat session or a virtual class or meeting
 abhaasi kakshaon evam baithkon main aksar sanchaar praudyogikiyon ke ek mishran kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 In many models, the writing community and communication channels relate with the e-education and m-education communities

 Education management system is trainee / education delivery, navigation and management software
 ye lemaus prashiksha / shaikshik record prabandhan software se lekar internet par paathyakram kaa vitaran karne vaale evam online sahyog kii suvidha pradaan karne vaale software ke rup main paae jate hai
 Education content management system is e-education content authoring, editing and cataloging software
 ek elsmes keval lemaus par host kiye jane vaale samagriyon ke nirmaan evam prakaashan ke liye samarpit ho saktaa he, yaa yah swayan samagriyon saamagree hosting model) ko host kar saktaa he
 From automated multiple-choice tests to more sophisticated systems, computer-aided evaluation available is becoming increasingly common
 kuch pranaaliyon kii sahaayta se ek chaatr kii vishisht galatiyon par adhik sakshamtapurvak pratikriya vyakt kii ja sakati he yaa computer prashnon kii ek shrinkhalaa ke madhyam se chaatr kaa maargdarshan kar saktaa he jisase yah maaloom hota he ki chaatr ne kya siikhaa yaa nahin siikhaa he
 The best examples of this follow a formative assessment structure known as "online formative assessment"
 iske tahat galat javaabon ko nikaalkar ek praarambhik rachanaatmak moolyankan kiya jaataa he
 The author / teacher will then explain what the students should do with each question
 iske baad chaatro ko nikaale gaye prashon ke prayek maamuli badlaav vaale sanskaran kaa kam se kam ek abhyaas karaayaa jayega
 This is the stage of creative education

 Modifiable elements are an attempt to define the structure or units of educational materials
 udhaaharan ke liye, yah ek sabak, ek kaam, ek bahuviklpi prashn, ek prashnottaree, ek charchaa samooh yaa ek maamle kaa adhyayan ho saktaa he
 The format of these units must be independent, although it can be in one of the following ways, so that the modular structures do not include a textbook, web page, video conference, or podcast
 i-shiksha ke samagriyon ke nirmaan kaary shuru karne ke samay sanshaikshik drushtikonon kaa moolyankan karnaa jaruri he
 Simple inflexible approaches make the manufacture of these materials easy but they lack flexibility, richness and transverse functionality

 shiksha vastuon kii malikana evam mukt, gaiyr-vanijyik evam vanijyik, donon tarah kii sahakarmi-samikshyit sangrah, jaise - merlot sangrah, uplabdh hai
 a common standard format of e-learning content is SCORM while other specifications allow the classification of "education objects" (transfer or metadata)
 ye maanak swayan paripakvata kii prakriya main aarambhik he or isamen se sabase purana maanak keval 8 varsh purana hi he
 They are also relatively vertical: the sif is predominantly PK-12, the loam is predominantly corp, military and higher ed, and the skorm is mainly military and corp with some higher aids

 The American PK12 location has a number of content standards that are quite important and the NCES data standard is a prime example of this
 prayek rajya sarkaar kaa saamagree maanak evam uplabdhi maandand us sthaan main i-shiksha vastuon ko jodne ke mahatvapurn metadata hai
 a classic example of e-education related to knowledge management and reusability is Navy e-learning, available to active duty, retired, or disabled military members

 Finally on 23 June 1757 a war broke out between the two known as the Plassey War
 is yuddh ke anek kaaran the jo is prakaar he
 Internal conflict- gaddi par baithte hi sirajuddaula ko shaukatganj ke sangharsh kaa saamana karnaa padaa kyonki shaukatganj nawab bananaa chahta tha
 In this, he had the support of Chhati Begum and his Divan Rajavallavas and the Mughal Emperor, so Siraj-ud-daulah first tried to resolve that internal conflict
 kyonki isi ke chalate bengal kii raajnneeti main angrejon kaa hastkshep badhata ja rahaa tha nawab ne shaukatganj kii hatya kar di
 And after that he decided to compete with the British
 angrej dwaara nawab ke viruddh shadyantra- From the very beginning, the British were eyeing Bengal
 kyonki bengal ek upjau or dhani praant tha
 Had Bengal been the company's authority, it hoped to earn more and more money
 itnaa hi nahin ve hindu vyapaariyon ko apni ore milakar unhen nawab ke viruddh bhadakaana shuru kiya nawab ise pasand nahin karata tha
 Use of business facilities - mughal samraat ke dwaara angrejon ko nishulk saamudrik vyapaar karne kii chhot mili thi lekin angrejon ne iskaa durupyog karnaa shuru kiya
 They also started doing their personal business free of charge and encouraged the native traders to do business without paying tax
 isse nawab ko aarthik kshati pahunchati thi
 The Nawab did not like them when, when he decided to stop the misuse of business facilities, the British came out on the struggle
 angrejon dwaara kile bandi- At this time there was a possibility of a seven-year war in Europe
 jisamen england or france ek duusare ke viruddh ladane vaale the at: duusare desh main bhi jo angrej or francisi the
 He feared war
 isliye apni- 2 sthiti ko majboot karne ke liye unhonen kilebandi karnaa shuru kiya
 The Nawab could not destroy it
 angrej dwaara sirajuddaula ko nawab kii manyata nahin dena- According to the ancient tradition of Bengal, if a new Nawab sat on the throne, then on that day there was a court
 or uske adheen nivas karne vaale raajaaon, amiron yaa videshi jatiyon ke pratinidhiyon ko darbar main upasthit ho kar uphaar bhet karnaa padataa tha
 That they accept the new Nawab
 parantu sirajuddaula ke rajyabhishek ke avasar par angrejon kaa koi pratinidhi darbar main hajir nahin hua
 Because they did not consider Siraj-ud-daulah as Nawab, due to this, the possibility of conflict between the two increased
 nawab badalane kii koshish- The British wanted to replace siraj-ud-daulah and make someone who was ready to follow his instructions, the British started trying to do this
 aisi paristhiti main sangharsh taala nahin ja saktaa tha
 Invasion of Calcutta jab nawab ne kile bandi karne ko rokane kaa aadesh jari kiya to angrejon ne usapar koi dhyaan nahin diya wo kile kaa nirmaan karte rahe
 The Nawab became angry on this and attacked Kothi of Kasimbazar on 4 June 1756
 angrej sainik is akraman se ghabadaa gaye or angrejon kii paraajay hui or kasim bazaar par nawab kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 After this, the Nawab attacked Fort William of Calcutta very soon, even the British soldiers could not get the teak in front of the Nawab and the Nawab also got the right
 is yuddh main kaaphi angrej sainik giraftaar kiye gayi
 Black closet accident uparyukt ladaai main nawab ne 146 angrej sainikon ko kaid kar liya to use ek choti si andheri kothri main band kar diya isaki lambaai 18 feet or chaudaai 14- 10 feet thi
 It was built by the British and Indian criminals were stopped in it
 chunki garmi kaa din tha or yuddh ke parim the 123 sainikon kii mrityu dam ghutane ke kaaran ho gai or 23 sainik bache jisamen hanwel ek angrej sainik bhi tha
 He informed about this incident to the British of Madras
 isi durghatana ko kaali kothri kii durghatana ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Due to this the anger of the British erupted and they started preparing for war with the Nawab
 angrejon dwaara kalakatta par pun: adhikaar- To avenge his defeat, the British soon attacked Calcutta
 is samay nawab ne manikchand ko kalakatta kaa raja niyukt kiya tha
 But he was a friend and well wisher of the British
 falat: angrejon kii vijay hui kalakatta nawab ke changul se mukt ho gaya
 The Treaty of Ali Nagar was signed between the two on 9 February 1757 and the British again got all kinds of practical rights
 francisiyon par angrejon kaa akraman- The British attacked Chand Nagar, the town of the French
 or use apane adhin kar liya
 The French were friends of the Nawab, so the Nawab was very upset with this incident
 mirajafar ke saath gupt sandhi – At the same time, the British hatched a conspiracy to depose the Nawab
 isamen nawab ke bhi kai log shaamil the
 Such as Raidullabh chief commander Mirzafar and rich businessman Jagat Sevak etc
 angrejon ne mirajafar ko bengal kaa nawab banane kaa pralobhan diya or iske saath gupt sandhi kii is sandhi ke pashchaat nawab par yah aarope lagaaya gaya ki unhone ali nagar kii sandhi kaa ulanghan kiya he or usee kaa bahaanaa banaakar angrej ne nawab par 22 june 1757 ko akraman kar diya
 a fierce battle ensued in the battle of Plassey, Mirzafar had already signed a treaty with the British, which resulted in a tremendous defeat of the Nawab
 angrejon kii vijay hui
 The Nawab was assassinated and Mirzafar was made the Nawab of Bengal
 plasi yuddh ke parinaam- The foundation of the British Empire was laid in Bengal by the Battle of Plassey
 angrejon ko nawab banaaya gaya
 The Battle of Plassey was not really a war; it was a conspiracy and a display of treachery
 According to the famous historian 'panivkar', Plassey's war was not, but the result was quite significant
 isliye ise vishwa ke nirnaayak yudhon main sthaan uplabdh he
 Because by this the foundation of British Empire was laid in Bengal
 clive ne is yuddh ko kranti kii sangya di he
 In fact it was a revolution because it brought a great change in the stream of Indian history and a business institution took the political reins of Bengal in its hands
 iske vibhinn tarah ke parinaam drushtigochar hote hai
 Political Results- iske raajnneetik parinaam bharat ke liye ghaatak siddh hua
 This led to the incorporation of political rights in the hands of a business institution and the establishment of British power in India
 vastut: yah british raashtra ke liye atyadhik mahatv tha is yuddh ke pashchaat mirajafar ko bengal kaa nawab banaaya gaya
 But this was an inept person
 iske ayogyata kafaita uthaate hue bengal kaa vaastavik shaasha angrej ban gaye
 The influence of the British on Bengal increased and gradually the path of expansion of 2 British Empire was cleared
 sirajuddaula ke hatane se angrejon ko raajnneetik prabhutv badhaane kaa phayda mila
 The result of B
 Plassey proved fatal to the Mughal Empire, every year the Mughal ruler used to earn a good income from Bengal, but now this income is exhausted
 angrejon ko bhartiya nareshon ko kamajori kii jaankaree mil gai
 In the future, he took great advantage of it and paved the way for the conquest of northern India
 aarthik parinaam- The war brought considerable economic benefits to the British, Mirzafar gave Rs 1 crore 17 lakh to the company, which strengthened the economic condition of the company, due to the plunder of Bengal, it cost him a lot of money
 company ke math karmchaareeyon ko saadhe 12 lakh rupye mili
 Clive received two lakh 24 thousand rupees
 is yuddh ke pashchaat company dhire- 2 jagidaar baad main bengal kii dewan ban gai
 Thus it laid the foundation of British Empire in India
 angrejon ko pun: vyapaar karne kaa adhikaar mila mirajafar ne company ko ghus ke rup main 3 karod rupye pradaan kiye tathaa vyapaar se bhi angrejon ne 15 karod kaa munafa kamaaya
 By- mohammad shahid is ghatana se ek nai rajnatik shakti kaa udai hua
 The interests of the company got entwined with politics and it started gaining dominance
 mogul samrajya ke durbalata bhi saaf ho gai
 The company came to know the divisions, the character of the ruling class of India
 sinhalai bhashaa srilanka main boli jane vaali sabase badi bhashaa he
 Tamil is the most spoken language in Sri Lanka after Sinhalese
 praaia: aisa nahin hota ki kisi desh kaa jo naam ho, vahi us dash main basane vaali jati kaa bhi ho or vahi naam us jati dwaara vyavahrut hone vaali bhashaa kaa bhi ho
 The specialty of Sinhala island is that the caste settled in it has been called "sinhala" and the language used by that caste is also "sinhala"
 anek bhartiya bhashaaon kii lipiyon kii tarah sinhal bhashaa kii lipi bhi brahmi lipi kaa hi parivartit viksit rup hai or jis prakaar urdu kii varnmaala ke atirikt devanagari sabhi bhartiya bhashaaon kii varnmaala he, usee prakaar devanagari hi sinhal bhashaa kii bhi varnmaala he
 Sinhala language has two forms - Shuddha Sinhala and Mixed Sinhala
 shuddh sinhal ko keval battis akshar maanya rahe hai- The oldest grammar book of Sinhala (siddatsangra) is of the opinion that the quantities of, and ai-a, and Aa are incremental quantities
 vartmaan mishrit sinhal ne apni varnmaala ko na keval paali varnmaala ke aksharon se samrudh kar liya he, balki sanskrit varnmaala main bhi jo or jitne akshar adhik the, un sab ko bhi apana liya he
 Thus the number of letters in the present mixed Sinhala is fifty four
 attharah akshar "swar" tathaa shesh chhattis akshar vyanjan maane jate hai
 When two letters are congruent, this process is called "pact"
 shuddh sinhal main sandhiyon ke keval das prakaar maane gaye hai
 But in modern Sinhala, the treaty or treaty of Sanskrit words is done according to the rules of Sanskrit grammar
 "ekakshar" athwa "anekaksharon" ke samooh padon ko bhi sanskrit kii hi tarah chaar bhaagon main vibhakt kiya jaataa he - namay, aakhyaat, upsarg tathaa nipaat
 Like Hindi in Sinhala, there are two words - "singular" and "plural"
 sanskrit kii tarah ek atirikt "dwivachan" nahin hota
 The distinction of this "singular" and "plural" is called number distinction
 jis prakaar "vachan" ko lekar "hindi" or "sinhal" kaa samya he usee prakaar ham kah sakate hai ki "ling" ke vishay main bhi hindi or shuddh sinhal samandharma he
 There are only three men - first man, middle man and best man
 teenon purushon main vyavahrut hone vaale sarvanaamon ke aath kaarak hai, jinaki apni-apni vibhaktiyaan hai
 The "karan" factor is often counted after "karma", but the "karta" factor between "karma" and "karan" is counted among the eight factors of Sinhala
 "sambodhan" kaarak nahin hone se "kartri" kaarak ke baavjood karkon kii ginati aath hi rahati he
 The head of the sentence assumes "action", because no statement is formed in the absence of a verb
 yon sinhal vyakaran adhikansh baton main sanskrit kii anukriti maatr he
 Even then, there are neither "parasmappad" nor "atmanapada" like Sanskrit nor ten lotus etc
 sinhal main kriyaaon ke ye aath prakaar maane gaye hai- At the time of speaking and speaking the Sinhala language, like our Bhojpuri dialects, it is very easy in terms of suffixes, but equally difficult in writing and reading
 bolne-chaalane main yanava kriyaapad se hi jaataa hoon, jate hai, jaataa he, jate ho, jaataa he, jate hai ityadi hi nahin, jayega, jaaenge aadi sabhi kriyaswaroopon kaa kaam ban jaataa he
 Gender discrimination is considered as a zigzag for Hindi students
 sinhal bhashaa is drushti se badi saral he
 There you can use the word "hond" synonymous with the word "good" for both "boy" and "girl"
 prayek bhashaa ke muhaavarey uske apane hote hai
 It is useless to find their exact synonym in other languages
 to bhi anubhav samya ke kaaran do bhinn jatiyon dwaara boli jane vaali do bhinn bhashaaon main ek jaisi milti-julati kahavatein uplabdh ho jaati hai
 There is sufficient uniformity in Sinhala and some idioms and proverbs in Hindi
 uttar bharat kii ek se adhik bhashaaon se milti-julati sinhal bhashaa kaa vikaas un shilalekhon kii bhashaa se hua he jo i
 pus
 duusari teesri shatabdi ke baad se lagaataar uplabdh he
 Two hundred years after Lord Buddha's Parinirvana, Ashokaputra Mahendra reached Sinhala Island, according to "mahavansh" he preached in the island language to the people of Sinhala Island
 mahamati mahendra apane saath "buddhavachan" kii jo parampara laae the, vah maukhik hi thi
 That tradition must have been either a "magadhi" of Buddha's time, or a "prakrit" of two hundred years later that Mahendra Sthavira himself would have spoken
 sinhal itihaas kii manyata he ki mahendra sthavir apane saath na keval tripitak kii parampara laae the, balki unke saath uske bhashyon athwa uski atthakathaon kii parampara bhi
 Those chronicles were later translated into Sinhala

 kadamb kul kaa gotra maanavy tha or ukt vansh ke log apni utpatti hariti se maanate the
 According to historical evidence, the founder of the Kadamba kingdom was a Brahmin named Mayur Sharmann who lived in Kanchi for schooling and was humiliated by a Pallava state official who established a small kingdom in Karnataka in retaliation between the fourth century AD
 is rajya kii rajdhani vaijayanti athwa banavaasi thi
 The Pallavas, who were troubled by the south victory of Samudragupta, could not intervene immediately to prevent the establishment of this kingdom

 The other powerful king of this clan was Kakustha Varmana, who expanded the dynasty's fame and kingdom considerably

 Dr
 Divakar Sharma Vishwambhara: july-december '09 / 2 dardi yaa dardik bhashaayen hind-arya bhashaaon kii ek upashakha he jisaki sabase jaani-maani bhashaa kashmiri he
 Dardi languages are spoken in northern Pakistan, north-eastern Afghanistan and the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir
 sari dardi bhashaaon main kashmiri kaa hi rutaba sabase unchaa he kyonki iskaa apana prachlit sahitya he or ise bharat kii ek aadhikarik bhashaa hone kaa maan bhi praapt he
 The Khwar language of Chitral district of Pakistan, the Sheena language spoken in northern Kashmir and the Pashai language spoken in eastern Nuristan, Nangarhar and Kuner states of Afghanistan are other famous Dardi languages
 isamen koi do raay nahin hai ki lagbhag sabhi dardi bhashaaon par sanskrit, farsi, punjabi, hindi-urdu ityadi kaa prabhaav padaa he or inke kai shabd dardi bhashaaon main istemaal hote hai
 But many linguists believe that Dardi languages too have left their mark on non-dardi hindi-aryan languages
 yah maananaa he ke punjabi, uttarakhand kii kuch boliyaan or kuch or bhashaaon par dardi kaa prabhaav nazar aata he
 While this continues to be disputed, there is a belief that in ancient times Dardi was spoken over a very large area which was spread around the Indus River and then in Himachal and Uttarakhand
 dardi bhashaaon kii kuch khaas chijen hai jinase samooche hind-arya bhashaa parivaar main unki pahchaan banati he, jaise kii mahapraan vyanjanon kaa uccharan alpapraan vyanjanon jaisaa hota he 
 In most hid-aryan languages, aspiration consonants are spoken with airflow, such as the aspirated consonant 'b' is spoken by airflow while its corresponding hypnotic consonant 'a' has very little airflow
 Is spoken with
 aisa dardik bhashaaon main nahin he
 In these languages, the diacritic and mahaprana consonants are distinguished by changing the tone rather than the airflow
 misaal ke taur par jahaan sanskrit main 'bhoomi' shabd he vahaan khovaar bhashaa main 'buum' he jisame awaz mote swar se patale swar kii ore jaati he 
 In the same way, where there is 'smoke' from the great word 'd' in Hindi, there is 'dum' from the short word 'd' in Pashai
 sanskrit ke 'dugdh' ore hindi ke 'doodh' ke sthaan par kashmiri main 'dod' hota he
 In the same way in the western hill and Punjabi, there is a change of tone in place of mahaprana, as in Punjabi, instead of 'home' in Hindi, the vowel is the word 'kara'
 dardi bhashaaon main aksar shabdaansh sthanantaran ho jaataa he, jisame ek hi shabd ke 'r' ke varna ke ird-gird koi swar apane sthaan main pher-badal kar letaa he
 It has been in ancient times in the Dardi languages and can also be seen in the rocks of the era of Emperor Ashoka in Gandhara region, which were erected from 269 BC to 231 BC
 samraat ashok kii ek oopaadhi 'priyadarshi' thi - lekin in shilaon par aksar 'priyadrashi' dekhne ko miltaa he kyonki shabdaansh sthanantaran ke kaaran 'darsh' kaa 'drash' ban gaya
 Similarly, on these rocks, 'dharma' is found in place of 'dharma'
 aadhunik kaal main sanskrit ke 'deergh' shabd kii jhalak kalash bhashaaon ke 'drig' shabd main milti he
 In Palula language, 'weak' in Sanskrit becomes 'drubal' and in Sanskrit 'bhurj' it becomes 'barhuj'
 sanskrit kaa 'daridr' kashmiri kaa 'droled' ban jaataa he or 'karm' kashmiri main 'kram' ban jaataa he
 This trend of Dardi languages can also be seen to some extent in Punjabi and Western Pahari languages
 jahaan farsi main ped ko 'darakht' kehete hai vahaan punjabi main yah 'drakhat' ho jaataa he
 In most indo-iranian languages, the verb comes at the end of a sentence
 lekin dardik bhashaaon main kriya shabd vaakya ke bich main aate hai
 In this case Dardi languages are like English
 upar likhe hue vaakyon main kriya ko gadhe aksharon main likhaa gaya he
 As is clear, in almost all indo-iranian languages, the verb comes at the end of the sentence, but Dardic breaks this rule and puts the verb after the noun, as in English
 aisi bhashaaon ko jo kriya sangya ke baad daalati hon "kriya dwitiya bhashaayen" kaha jaataa he

 In Saptaparna, Mahadevi with his cultural consciousness has presented Hindi poetry of 39 selected important parts by establishing the identity of Vedas, Ramayana, Ther saga, Ashwaghosh, Kalidas, Bhavabhuti and Jayadeva
 aarambh main 61 prishthiya ‘apni baat’ main unhone bhartiya manisha or sahitya kii is amuly dharohar ke sambandh main gahan shodhapurna vimarsh bhi prastut kiya he
 Jayadev is revered by Mahadevi Varma on the seventh step after 'arashvani, Valmiki, Theragatha, Ashwaghosh, Kalidas and Bhavabhuti under' Saptaparna '
 unhone bataaya he ki jayadev kaa jab aavirbhaav hua tab sanskrit ke shringaari kavy ke nayak-nayika ke rup main radhakrishna kii pratishtha ho chuki thi

 In this way, he divided the Ahorarat of his life into these five symbolic titles and made it clear the point of his spiritual practice
 vednaa kii is ekant sadhana ke falswaroop mahadevi kii kavita main vishyon kaa vaividhya bahut kam he
 There are only a few of his poems in which national and cultural discourse or independent portrayal of nature has been done
 shesh sabhi kavitaaon main vishaywastu or drushtikon ek hi hone ke kaaran unki kavyabhumi vistrut nahin ho saki hai
 This has caused both loss and gain to his poetry
 haani yah hui he ki vishay parivartan na hone se unke samast kavy main ekresata or bhavavriti bahut adhik he
 The advantage has been that within the limited area, the poet has depicted many dimensions of the sensations from several perspectives by looking at their microcosmic distinctions in front of them
 is tarah unke kavy main vistaargat vishalata or darshanagat gurutv bhale hi na mili, par unki bhaawanaaon kii gambhirtha, anubhutiyon kii sookshmata, bimbon kii spashtataa or kalpana kii kamaniyata ke falswaroop ganbhiry or mahatta avashya he
 In this way, his poetic expansion is not a poem of depth
 mahadevi kaa kavy varnanaatmak or itivrittatmak nahin hai
 He has expressed inner subtle feelings in the form of innate sensations
 is kaaran unki abhivyanjana paddati main lakshanikta or vyanjaktaa kaa bahulya he
 The seductive images he presents with metaphorical images and symbols reveal his subtle vision and power of colorful imagination
 ye chitra unhone apane pariparshv, visheshkar prakritik parivesh se liye hai par prakruti ko unhone alamban rup main bahut kam grahan kiya
 Prakriti has always been depicted in his poetry only in the form of stimulation, ornamentation, symbol and symbol
 isi kaaran prakruti ke ati parichit or sarvajansulabh drishyon yaa vastuon ko hi unhone apane kavy kaa upadan banaaya hai
 His extraordinary and understated scenes have gone unnoticed
 phir bhi simit prakritik upaadaanon ke dwaara unhone jo purna yaa aanshik bimb chitrit kiye hai, unase unki chitravidhaayini kalpana kaa puraa parichay mil jaataa he
 The philosophy of this imagination is also seen in his paintings, which he has created not through words but through colors and paintbrush
 unke ye chitra 'deepashikha' or 'yama' main kavitaaon ke saath prakashit hue hai
 Mahadevi Varma has written- 'those who touch the philosopher of art have no name other than artist, no class other than seeker, no capital other than truth, no business other than sentiment and none other than welfare
 Not profit
 ' lekhan-avadhi main unhone ekanishtha hokar abaadh-gati se bhavamay srijan or karmmay jivan kii sadhana main likhi hui baat ko sarthak banaaya
 There is a Mahadevi who has also realized the heart of poetry in prose and has made a proclamation of 'prose Kavinam Nikshman Vadanti'
 vilakshan baat to yah he ki na to unhone upanyaas likhaa, na kahani, na hi naatak phir bhi shreshth gadhykar hai
 His writings include sketches, memoirs or travelogue on the one hand and editorials, roles, essays and address on the other hand, but all of them have diversified life as a whole
 bina kalpanashrith kavy roopon kaa sahaara liye koi rachanaakaar gadhy main itnaa kuch arjeet kar saktaa he, yah mahadevi ko padhakar hi janaa ja saktaa he
 Like Chandrakanta Mani in Hindi literature, Mahadevi Varma, the goddess of the volatile Karun Rasa, is not only a distinguished artist, poetess and prose writer, but is also an outstanding essayist
 unka gadhy kavita kii bhaanti saundarya ke bhulaave main daalkar hamen jivan se dur nahin le jaataa, vah to hamaari shiraaon main chetana bharkar hamen yatharth jivan main jhaankne kii prerana pradaan karata he
 Lines of Smriti and constant curiosity in the movie of the past, Sheel Mahadevi has immortalized those characters by portraying various forms of life very tenderly by indelible lines based on Smriti
 inamen gaanv, ganwai ke nirdhan, vipann log, balvidhwaaon, vimaataaon, punarvivaahitaaon tathaa kathith bhrashtaon or vruddh-vivaah ke kaaran prataditaaon ke atyant shashakt evam karun chitra he
 Mahadevi has rightly depicted not only women but also neglected men
 rama, ghisa, alopi or badalu aadi ke rekhachitr unke asaadhaaran maanavtawaad kii ore ingit karte hai
 Mahadevi has depicted the characteristics, weaknesses and problems of lower class characters in most of his drawings
 sevak rama kii vatsalyapurna seva, bhangin sabia kii pati-parayanata or sahansheeltaa, ghisa kii nishchal gurubhakti, saag-bhaaji ke vikreta andhe alopi kaa saral vyaktitv, kumbhakaar badalu tathaa radhiva kaa saral daanpaty prem, pahaad kii ramani lakshamaa kaa mahadevi ke prati anupam sneh-bhav, vruddh bhakthin kii pragalbhta tathaa swami-bhakthi, chini yuvak kii karun-maarmik jivan-gaatha, parvaty kuli jangbahadur tathaa uske anuj dhaniya kii karmthata aadi anek vishyon ko rekhachitron main sthaan diya he
 Mahadevi has presented all the memorabilia from within her life, so it is only natural that various events of her own life and various parts of her character have got place
 unhone apni anubhutiyon ko jyon kaa tyon yatharth rup main ankit kiya he
 It is worth mentioning here that the element of characterization has been prominent in Mahadevi's sketches, the story has appeared in her embrace
 unke in rekhachitron main gambhir lok kaa bhi paryaapt samavesh hua he
 In 'path Ke Saathi', Mahadevi portrays her contemporary creators
 jis sammaan or atmiyatapurna dhang se unhone in sahityakaron kaa jivan-darshan or swabhaavgat mahanata ko sthapit kiya he vah apane aap main badi uplabdhi he
 There are also memoirs in 'path's companions' and the life pages of poets read by Mahadevi
 unhone ek ore sahityakaron kii nikatataa, atmiyata or prabhaav kaa kaavyatmak ullekh kiya he or duusari ore unke samgr jivan darshan ko parakhane kaa praytn kiya he
 In the 'path of Saathi' the lines of Kavindra Ravindra, Dadda, Prasad, Nirala, Pant, Subhadrakumari Chauhan and Siyaramsharan Gupta have come in the form of word-pictures
 shrunkhlaa kii kadiyaan' main saamaajik samasyaon, vishesh kar abhishpt nari jivan ke jalte prashnon ke sambandhon main likhe unke vichaaratmak niabandh sankalit hai
 Apart from creative prose, 'critical prose of Mahadevi' and his critical talent in the roles of 'deepshikha', 'vama' and 'modern poet- Mahadevi' can be easily realized

 a logic gate or logic gate is a device whose output is a logical function of the current signals or earlier signals present at its input
 yah bhautik yukti ho sakati he yaa koi adarshikrut yukti
 Nowadays most semiconductor logic gates are used, but in theory they can also be made from electromagnetic relays, liquid logic, pressure logic, optical logic, molecules etc
 booleey logic se jin algorithm kaa varnan kiya ja saktaa he unhen in bhautik geton se un algoridmon ko saakaar rup bhi diya ja saktaa he 
 Just as a door can be in two stages - 'open or closed', the output of a logic gate can also be 'high or low'
 logic get, and or or jaise saral bhi ho sakate hai or ek computor jitna jatil bhi
 a logic gate built using a diode is the simplest logic gate
 kintu iske keval AND tathaa OR get hi banaaye ja sakate hai, 'inwarter' nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 Hence it can be called an 'incomplete logic family'
 invar sahit sabhi logic get banane main sakasham hone ke liye kisi prakaar ke pravardhak kii jarurat hogi
 Therefore, the use of relay, vacuum nozzles or transistors is indispensable to create a 'complete logic family'
 bipolar transistoron kaa prayog karke bana logic parivaar register-transistor logic kehalaata he
 This was used in early integrated circuits
 iske baad vibhinn drushtiyon se sudhaar karte hue diod-transistor logic or transistor-transistor logic aaye
 Now almost all the transistors have been replaced by MOSFET, which causes less IC to occupy and less energy to work
 vartmaan main prayukt logic parivaar kaa naam complimentry metal-oxide-semiconductor he
 The output of a three-stage logic gate has three different states
 ye hai - hai, lo or hai impidence 
 From the point of view of high intensity, there is no role
 kintu apane hai impidence vaali avasthaa ke kaaran in yuktiyon kaa upyog data bas par vibhinn yuktiyon se data bhejne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Except for the device which is sending data to the bus, all other devices connected to that bus are converted to 'high Impedance State'
 is prakaar ye anya yuktiyaan ek prakaar se bas se judi hokar bhi usase alag hai kyonki bas or inke output ke bich 'hai impidence' maujuud he
 There are two types of rational gates - combinational logic and sequential logic
 sangyojan tark kaa output uske inputon kii vartmaan avasthaa par hi keval nirbhar karata he na ki unki pehle kii avasthaa yaa avasthaaon par
 In other words, it can be said that they do not have memory
 iske kuch udhaaharan hai - binary aidar, incoder, dicoder aadi
 Logic gates can also be used for data storage
 iske liye ltch paripath yaa 'flip-flop' kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 When multiple flip-flops are added in parallel, multi-bit data can be stored in it
 ise register kehete hai
 a type of 'memory' exists in a system consisting of flip-flops
 isi liye inase computor kii memory banaayi jaati he
 There are many types of memory of a computer
 keval NOR yaa keval NAND kaa prayog karke kisi bhi anya logic get kaa kaam liya ja saktaa he
 Therefore these logic gates are called 'universal logic gate'
 keval AND, yaa keval OR, yaa keval NOT geton kaa prayog karke icchaanusaar koi bhi logic falan banane sambhav nahin he
 Therefore AND, OR and NOT gates are not universal logic gates
