 At the time when there were new ideas about the religion of Lord Mahavira and Buddha in India, a reformer was born in China, named Confucius
 us samay china main jhou rajvansh kaa basant or sharad kaal chal rahaa tha
 Over time, the power of the Zhou dynasty had become weak, many states were established in China, which always fought among themselves, which came to be called the era of quarreling states
 atah china kii praja bahut hi ksht jhel rahi thi
 At such a time, Mahatma Confucius emerged to teach morality lessons to the people of China
 inkaa janm isa messiah ke janm se kareeb 550 varsh pehle china ke shandong pradesh main hua tha
 His father died in childhood
 unke gyaan kii aakanksha aseem thi
 They had to acquire knowledge by suffering a lot
 17 varsh kii umr main unhen ek sarkari naukari mili
 After a few years, he left the government job and started teaching
 ghar main hi ek vidhyalay kholkar unhone vidhyaarthiyon ko shiksha dena prarambh kiya
 He used to teach students history, poetry and ethics orally
 unhone kavy, itihaas, sangeet or nitishastra par kai pustakon kii rachana kii
 He was the ruler of a city in Lu State at the age of 53 and later he was appointed as a minister
 mantri hone ke naate inhone dand ke badale manushya ke charitra sudhaar par bal diya
 Confucius gave the message of truth, love and justice to his disciples
 ve sadachaar par adhik bal dete the
 He used to inspire people to become humble, benevolent, virtuous and characterful
 They used to ask elders and ancestors to respect them
 He used to say don't treat others like you don't want to do with yourself
 kanceyucious ek sudhaarak the, dharm prachaarak nahin
 He did not give any teachings about God, but still later people started considering him as a religious teacher
 inaki mrityu 480 i
 pus
 main ho gai thi
 Confucian social reformers preached a stability in Chinese society
 kanceyucious kaa darshan shaastra aaj bhi chini shiksha ke liye path pradarshak bana hua he
 The Confucians never thought it necessary to give their ideas in writing
 uskaa mat tha ki vah vichaaron kaa vaahak ho saktaa he, unka srashta nahin
 He was a worshiper of archeology, because he thought that only through this can real knowledge be gained
 uskaa kahana tha ki manushya ko uske samast kaaryakalapon ke liye niyam apane andar hi praapt ho sakate hai
 Not only for the individual, but the rules and patterns of improvement and correct development of the whole society can be found in the words and work of the ancient Mahatmas
 kanfushas ne koi aisa lekh nahin choda jisamen uske dwaara pratipaadit naitik evam saamaajik vyavastha ke siddhanton kaa nirupan ho
 But all the information related to it is found in the books called 'the Principle of Average' written by his grandson Tje Sje and 'mahan Shiksha' written by his disciple Tsong Sin
 'basant or patjhad' naamak ek granth, jise lu kaa itivrutt bhi kehete hai, kanfushas kaa likhaa hua bataaya jaataa he
 This entire work is well received and although very small, it is considered ideal for brief histories of China
 kanfushas ke shishyon kii sankhya sab milakar praaia: 3,000 tak pahunch gai thi, kintu unamem se 75 ke lagbhag hi ucch koti ke pratibhashali vidvan the
 His dear disciples used to stay near him
 ve uske aasapaas shraddhapurvak uthte-baithte the or uske aacharan kii sookshm visheshtaon par dhyaan diya karte the tathaa uske mukh se nikali vaani ke prayek shabd ko hridyangam kar lete or usapar manan karte the
 He used to study ancient history, poetry and social practices of the country from him
 kanfushas kaa kahana tha ki kisi desh main acha shashan or shanti tabhi sthapit ho sakati he jab shaasha, mantri tathaa janata kaa prayek vyakti apane sthaan par uchit kartavyon kaa paalan karata rahe
 The ruler should be the ruler in the true sense, the minister should be the minister in the true sense
 kanfushas se ek baar poocha gaya ki yadi use kisi pradesh ke shashansutra ke sanchaalan kaa bhaar saunpa jaae to vah sabase pehla koun sa mahatvapurn kaary karegaa
 His answer for this was - 'improvement of Names'
 iskaa aashay yah tha ki jo jis naam ke pad par pratishthit ho use us pad se sanlagn sabhi kartavyon kaa vidhiwat paalan karnaa chahie jisase uskaa vah naam sarthak ho
 He had full faith in the power of example and ideal
 uskaa vishwaas tha ki adarsh vyakti apane sadacharan se jo udhaaharan prastut karte hai, aam janata unke saamne nishchay hi jhuk jaati he
 If the ruler of a country is made well aware of what he should do and how to do governance, then surely he can improve his conduct and make his state happy by presenting his example, Can make it rich and prosperous
 isi vishwaas ke bal par kanfushas ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki yadi koi shaasha 12 maheene ke liye use apana mukhya paramarshdaata bana le to vah bahut kuch karke dikhaa saktaa he or yadi use teen varsh kaa samay diya jaae to vah apane aadarsho or aashaaon ko moort rup pradaan kar saktaa he
 Confucius never claimed that he received any divine power or divine messages
 vah keval is baat kaa chintan karata tha ki vyakti kya he or samaaj main uske kartavya kya hai
 He never mentioned power performance, extraordinary and non-human powers, rebellious tendencies and deities
 uskaa kathan tha ki budhimatta kii baat yahi he ki prayek vyakti purna uttardayitv or eemaandaaree se apane kartavya kaa paalan kare or devi devataaon kaa aadar karte hue bhi unase alag rahe
 He was of the opinion that the person who cannot serve human beings will serve the Gods and Goddesses
 use apane or dusron ke sabhi kartavyon kaa purna dhyaan tha, isiilie usne kaha tha ki bura aadmi kabhi bhi shashan karne ke yogya nahin ho saktaa, bhale hi vah kitna bhi shaktisampann ho
 The ruler punishes those who violate the rules, but he should never forget that there is no power other than the power to present his ideal of good conduct
 kanfushas ke darshanik, saamaajik tathaa raajnneetik vichaaron par aadhaarit mat ko kanfooshivaad yaa kungaphutsiwad naam diya jaataa he
 According to Confucian, goodness is a natural quality of man
 manushya ko yah swaabhaavik gun ishwar se praapt hua he
 Therefore, to act according to this nature is to respect God's will and to not act accordingly is to disobey God

 Henri Fayol was a mining engineer and manager of France
 unhone vyavsaay prashasan kaa saamaanya siddhanth viksit kiya jiskaa 20veen sadi ke prarambh main vyapak prabhaav tha
 Fayol and his colleagues developed this theory independently of the theory of scientific management and almost at the same time
 prabandhan ke aadhunik sankalpana ke vikaas main sabase prabhavi yogadan karne waalon main feol kaa naam agrani he
 Fayol's administrative principles serve as an important link in the development of the classical ideology of management
 jahaan fredrick winslo tailor kaarkaane main karmshaala str par shreshthatam kaary paddati kii rachana karne, din kaa uchit kaary, vibhedatmak mazdooree pranali, evam kriyaatmak formanship ke rup kaary karne main kranti laane main safal rahaa vahiin henry feyol ne samajhaayaa ki prabandhak kaa kya kaary he evam ise puraa karne ke liye kin siddhanton kaa paalan kiya jayega
 In the factory system, if the work capacity of the workers is important, the efficiency of the manager is equally important
 feyol ke yogadan ko prabandh kii kushalta main sudhaar main uske siddhanton ke prabhaav jo vartmaan main bhi hai ke rup main samajhnaa chahie
 Henry Fayol was born in 1841 in the border area of istanbul
 uske pita bhi civil ejeeniyar the or galaata pul ke nirmaan ke sambandh main vahaan niyukt kiye gayi the
 Fayol's family returned to France in 1847
 france aakar feol 1860 main saint aetene kii khanan academy se khanan ejineering main snaatak hue
 The 19-year-old engineer founded the mining company 'compané de Commentari Fourchambín Decazé Villé' and served as managing director from 1888 to 1918
 uske siddhant utpaadan sanghathan ke pratiyogi udhyam jo jise apni utpaadan laagat ko niyantran main rakhana hota he ke sandarbh main prayukt kiye jate hai
 Fayol was the first person to define four tasks of management - planning, organization, direction and control
 feyol ke anusaar kisi audyogic ikai ke kaaryon ko is prakaar baanta ja saktaa tha-takneekee, vanijyik, vittiya, suraksha, lekhakarm, evam prabandhan
 He suggested that the qualities that are necessary in a manager are physical, moral, educational, knowledge and experience
 uskaa maananaa tha ki prabandh kaa vah siddhant jo sanghathan ke prachaalan kaa sudhaar main sahaayak ho sakate hai, jisaki kshamta kii koi seemaa nahin he
 He mostly developed the concept of administration based on his own experience
 uske dwaara pratipaadit 14 siddhanton par 1917 main prakashit pustak ‘administration industrili at janereli', main vistaar se charchaa kii gai thi
 In 1949 it was published in English under the title 'general and Industrial Management'
 uske yogadan ke kaaran use ‘saamaanya prabandh kaa janak’ kaha jaataa he
 14 principles of managing Fayol are given below- kaary vibhaajan ko karne ke liye kaary ko chote-chote bhaagon main vibhakt kiya jaataa he
 Each task requires a qualified person who is a trained expert
 is prakaar se kaary vibhaajan se vishishtikaran hota he
 According to Fayol, vyavsaay main kaary ko adhik kushalta se puraa kiya ja saktaa he, yadi use vishisht kaaryon main vibhajit kar diya gaya he tathaa prayek kaary vishisht athwa prashikshit karmchaaree hi karata he
 This makes production more effectively and efficiently
 is prakaar se ek company main alag-alag vibhaag hai, jaise vitt, vipanan, utpaadan evam maanav sansaadhan vikaas aadi
 Each has experts to work with
 jo milakar company ke utpaadan evam vikray kaa lakshya praapt karte hai
 According to Fayol, the principle of division of work should be applied equally in all actions, whether managerial or technical
 feyol ke anusaar ‘adhikaar aadesh dene evam ajna paalan karaane kaa adhikaar he, jabaki uttardaayitv adhikaar kaa up-siddhant he
 There are two types of authority which is the right to order and personal right which is the personal right of the manager
 ’ Rights are both formal and informal
 prabandhak ko adhikaar or uske samaan uttardaayitv kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 There should be equality in rights and responsibilities
 sanghathan ko prabandhkeey shakti ke durupyog se bachaav kii vyavastha kerani chahie
 In addition, the manager must have the necessary powers to perform the responsibilities
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek vikray prabandhak ko kreta se sauda karnaa hota he
 He sees that if he gives 60 days credit facility to the customer, then maybe the deal is done and the company will get a profit of Rs 50 crore net
 mana company prabandhak ko 40 din ke udhaar dene kaa adhikaar detii he
 This shows that there is no equality between rights and responsibilities
 is maamle main company ke hit ko dhyaan main rakhte hue prabandhak ko 60 din ke udhaar dene kaa adhikaar milanaa chahie
 In this instance, the manager should not get the right to lend for 100 days because it is not required here
 ek prabandhak ko vaid aadesh kaa jaanboojh kar paalan na karne par adhinsth ko sajaa dene kaa adhikaar hona chahie lekin saath hi adhinsth ko bhi apni sthiti spasht karne kaa paryaapt avasar milanaa chahie
 Discipline refers to following the rules and conditions of the job required for the organization to function
 feyol ke anusaar anushaasan ke liye prayek str par achche paryaaveksh, spasht evam santoshjanak samjhaute evam dand ke nyyochit vidhaan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Supposedly, there has been an agreement between the management and the trade union, according to which the employees have made an agreement to work extra hours without taking extra wages to get the company out of the situation of loss
 prabandh ne iske badale main uddeshy ke puraa ho jane par karmchaariyon kii mazdooree vruddhi kaa vaayada kiya he
 Discipline here means that both workers and managers will fulfill their promises with any kind of malice towards each other
 feyol ke anusaar prayek karmchaaree kaa keval ek hi adhikari hona chahie
 If an employee takes orders from two officers at the same time, it would be considered a violation of the principle of unity of order
 aadesh kii ekta ke siddhant ke anusaar kisi bhi aupchaarik sanghathan main karyrat vyakti ko ek hi adhikari se aadesh lene chahie evam usee ke prati uttaradaayi hona chahie
 Fayol gave great importance to this theory
 usko aisa laga ki yadi is siddhant kaa ulanghan hota he to ‘adhikaar prabhaavaheen ho jaataa he, anushaasan sankat main aa jaataa he, aadesh main vyavdhaan pad jaataa he evam sthayitv ko khatra ho jaataa he
 'this matches Fayol's principles
 isse jo kaary karnaa he uske sambandh main kisi prakaar kii bhranti nahin rahegi
 Suppose a salesperson is asked to deal with a customer and the marketing manager gives him a 10 percent discount
 lekin vitt vibhaag kaa aadesh he ki chhot 5 pratishat se adhik nahin di jaae
 There is no unity of order here
 yadi vibhinn vibhaagon main samanvayan he to is sthiti se bachaa ja saktaa he
 The organization should move towards the same objectives through coordinated and focused efforts to all the units
 gatividhiyon ke prayek samooh jinke uddeshy samaan hai unka ek hi adhyaksh evam ek hi yojana honi chahie
 This will ensure the unity and cooperation of the proceedings
 udaahranarth ek company motor saikal evam car kaa utpaadan kar rahi he
 For this, he should create two separate departments
 prayek vibhaag kii apni prabharee yojana evam sansaadhan hone chahie
 By no means should the functions of the two departments be based on each other
 feyol ke anusaar sanghathan ke hiton ko karmchaaree vishesh ke hiton kii tulana main praathamikta deni chahie
 Everyone has some interest in working in the company
 company ke bhi apane uddeshy hote hai
 For example, the company would want maximum output from its employees at competitive costs
 jabaki karmchaaree yah chahega ki use kam-se-kam kaary kar adhiktam vetan praapt ho
 In the second situation, an employee would like some exemption like working less time, which no other employee will get
 sabhi paristhitiyon main samooh / company ke hit, kisi bhi vyakti ke hiton kaa adhikraman karenge
 Because the larger interests of employees and beneficiaries are more important than the interests of any one person
 udhaaharan ke liye vibhinn hitadhikari jaise ki swami, anshadhari, lender, dendar, vittapradaata, kar adhikari, graahak evam samaaj ke hiton kaa, kisi ek vyakti athwa vyaktiyon ke ek chote samooh, jo company par dawaab bananaa chaahate hai ki hiton ke liye qurbaani nahin di ja sakati
 a manager can ensure this by his exemplary behavior
 udhaaharan ke liye use company / karmchaariyon ke bade saamaanya hiton kii keemat par vyakti / parivaar ke laabh ke liye apane adhikaron ke durupyog ke pralobhan main nahin padana chahie
 This will increase his respect in the eyes of employees and employees will behave equally
 kul pratifal evam kshatipurti karmchaaree evam sanghathan donon ke liye hi santoshjanak hona chahie
 Employees must be paid so much wages that at least their standard of living is reasonable
 lekin saath hi yah company kii bhugtan kshamta kii simaaon main honi chahie
 In other words the returns should be justified
 isse anukool vaataavaran banegaa evam karmchaaree tathaa prabandh ke bich sambandh bhi sumdhur rahenge
 As a result, the company's work will continue to run smoothly
 nirnay lene kaa adhikaar yadi kendrit he to ise kendrikaran kahenge jabaki adhikaar yadi ek se adhik vyaktiyon ko saunp diya jaataa he to ise ‘vikendrikaran’ kahenge
 There is a need, in Fayol's words, to maintain a balance in retaining the ultimate rights through decentralization of subordinates
 kendrikaran kii seemaa company kii kaary paristhitiyon par nirbhar karegi
 Generally larger organizations have more decentralization than smaller organizations
 udhaaharan ke liye, hamaare desh main panchayaton ko gaanvon ke kalyaan ke liye sarkaar dwaara pradutt nidhi ke sambandh main nirnay lene evam unako vyay karne ke adhik adhikaar die hai
 This is decentralization at the national level
 kisi bhi sanghathan main ucch adhikari evam adhinsth karmchaaree hote hai
 The formal authority line from the highest position to the lowest position is called the 'step chain'
 freyal ke shabdon main sanghathanon main adhikaar evam sampreshan kii shankhala honi chahie jo upar se neeche tak ho tathaa usee ke anusaar prabandhak evam adhinsth hone chahie
 Let us look at a situation in which there is a president under which there are two rights chains
 ek main ‘kha’ ‘ga’ ‘gha’ ‘gha’ ‘c’ tathaa duusare main ‘chha’, ‘ja’, ‘jha’, ‘na', evam ‘t’ hai
 If 'd' is to be communicated with 'o', then he has to walk through the path of d, d, c, b, k, g, j, j, j
 kyonki yahan sopan shrunkhlaa ke siddhant kaa paalan ho rahaa he
 According to Fayol, this chain should not normally be violated in formal communication
 yadi koi aakasmik sthiti he to gha sidhe na se samtal sampark ke dwaara sampark saadhe saktaa he jaisaa chitra main darshaya gaya he
 This is a short route and its provision has been made so that communication is not delayed
 vyavhaar main aap dekhte hai ki company main koi shramik sidhaa mukhya kaaryakari adhikari se sampark nahin kar saktaa
 Even if it is required, all the formal level ie foreman superintendent, manager, director etc
 should have knowledge related to the subject
 keval aakasmik paristhitiyon main hi ek shramik mukhya kaaryakari adhikaar se sampark kar saktaa he
 According to Fayol, people and goods should be in proper place at the right time for maximum work efficiency
 vyavastha kaa siddhant kahata he ki fpratyek cheez ke liye ek sthaan tathaa prayek cheez apane sthaan par honi chahie
 This essentially means arrangement
 yadi prayek cheez ke liye sthaan nishchit he to tathaa yah us sthaan par he to vyavsaay kaarkaana kii kriyaaon main koi vyavdhaan nahin paidaa hoga
 This will increase productivity and efficiency
 feyol ke shabdon main, fsabhi karmchaariyon ke prati nishpakshta ko sunishchit karne ke liye sadbuddhi evam anubhav kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 These employees should be treated as objectively as possible
 prabandhakon ke shramikon ke prati vyavhaar main yah siddhant dayabhav evam nyaay par jor detaa he
 Fayol sometimes does not consider the use of force irregular
 balki uskaa kahana he ki sust vyaktiyon ke saath sakhti se vyavhaar karnaa chahie jisase ki prayek vyakti ko yah sandesh pahunche ki prabandh kii nigahon main prayek vyakti baraabar he
 There should be no discrimination against any person on the basis of gender, religion, language, caste, faith or nationality etc
 vyavhaar main ham avlokan karte hai ki aajkal bahurashtriya companiyon main vibhinn rashtriyata ke log bhedbhaav rahit vaataavaran main saath-saath kaam karte hai
 In these companies, each person gets equal opportunities for growth
 tabhi to ham pate hai ki rajat gupta jaisi bhartiya mul ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari makinse incorpareshan jaisi bahurashtriya company ke mukhiya bane
 Recently, India-born American Arun Sarin became the Chief Executive Officer of Vodafone Ltd - a uk-based telecom company
 feyol ke anusaar fsanghathan kii kaarykushalta ko banaae rakhane ke liye karmchaariyon kii aavart ko nunatam kiya ja saktaa he
 The selection and appointment of employees should be done through proper and rigorous process
 lekin chayan hone ke pashchaat unhen nunatam nirdhaarit avadhi ke liye pad par banaae rakhana chahie
 His term should be stable
 unhen parinaam dikhaane ke liye upyukt samay diya janaa chahie
 In this context, any form of adhocity will create instability insecurity among employees
 vah sanghathan ko chhodana chahenge
 Recruitment, selection and training costs will be high
 isiilie karmchaaree ke kaarykaal kii sthirataa vyavsaay ke liye shreshthakar rahati he
 Fayol believes that workers should be encouraged to develop and implement their plans for improvement
 pahal kshamta kaa arth he- swayan abhiprerana kii disha main pehla kadam uthaanaa
 In this, the plan is considered and then implemented
 yah ek budhimaan vyakti ke lakshanon main se ek he
 Initiative should be encouraged but it does not mean that you should work against the established policy of the company to show yourself something different
 ek acchhee company vah he jisamen karmchaaree dwaara suzav paddati hai jiske anusaar us pahal-kshamta sujhaavon ko puraskrit kiya jaataa he jinke kaaran laagat / samay main thos kami aae
 According to Fayol, the management should promote a sense of unity and mutual support among employees
 y prabandh ke samuhik kaary ko badhaava dena chahie, vishesh rup se bade sanghathanon main
 Because if it does not, it will be difficult to achieve the objectives
 isse samanvay kii bhi haani hogi
 In order to nurture the spirit of cooperation, the manager should use 'we' instead of 'I' in the entire conversation with the employees
 isse samooh ke sadasyon main parsparik vishwaas evam apanepan kii bhaavana paidaa hogi
 This will also reduce the need for fines
 uparyukt charchaa se yah spasht he ki feyol ke prabandh ke 14 siddhant prabandh kii samasyaon par vistrut rup se lagu hote hai tathaa aaj inkaa prabandh kii soch par gaharaa prabhaav padaa he
 But in the changed environment in which business is being done today, the interpretation of these principles has changed

 Xavier's School
 jagadish chandra bose kii jeev vigyaan main bahut ruchi thi or 22 varsh kii aayu main chikitsa vigyaan kii padhai karne ke liye landan chale gaye
 But due to poor health, he gave up the idea of becoming a doctor and went to Christ's College, Cambridge, and there, a famous professor of physics, Father Lafont, inspired Bose to study physics
 varsh 1885 main ye swadesh laute tathaa bhautikee ke sahaayak praadhyaapak ke rup main presidency college main padhaane lage
 Here he stayed until 1915
 us samay bhartiya shikshakon ko angrej shikshakon kii tulana main ek tihaai vetan diya jaataa tha
 This was opposed by Jagdish Chandra Bose and continued to work for three years without pay, due to which his condition deteriorated and he was severely indebted
 is karj ko chukaane ke liye unhen apni pushtaini jameen bhi bechni padi
 Jagdish Chandra Bose won the fourth year and was given full salary
 bose ek achche shikshak bhi the, jo kaksha main padhaane ke liye bade paimaane par vaigyanik pradarshnon kaa upyog karte the
 Some students of Bose like Satendra Nath Bose later became famous physicists
 british saidhantik bhautik vigyaani james clerk maxwell ne ganitiya rup se vividh tarang dairdhya kii vidyut chumbakeey tarangon ke astitv kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi, par unki bhavishyavaanee ke satyaapan se pehle 1879 main nidhan unka ho gaya
 British physicist Oliver Lodge demonstrated the existence of Maxwell waves by transmitting them with stars in 1887–88
 german bhautikashastri henrik hertz ne 1888 main mukt antariksh main vidyut chumbakeey tarangon ke astitv ko prayog karke dikhaaya
 Subsequently, Lodge continued Hertz's work and gave a memorable lecture in June 1894 and published it in book form
 loj ke kaam ne bharat ke bose sahit vibhinn deshon ke vaigyanikon kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya
 The first notable aspect of Bose's microwave research was that he brought the wavelength to the millimeter level
 ve prakaash ke gunon ke adhyayan ke liye lambii tarang dairdhya kii prakaash tarangon ke nuksaan ko samaj gaye
 In 1893, Nikola Tesla performed the first public radio communications
 ek saal baad, kolkata main navambar 1894 ke ek saarvajanik pradarshan dauraan, bose ne ek millimetre range microwave tarang kaa upyog barood duuri par prajvalit karne or ghanti bajaane main kiya
 Lieutenant Governor Sir William mckenzie witnessed Bose's performance at the Calcutta Town Hall
 bose ne ek bengali niabandh, 'adrishy alok' main likhaa tha, "adrishy prakaash aasaani se eent kii deevaaron, bhawanon aadi ke bheetar se ja sakati he, isliye taar kii bina prakaash ke madhyam se sandesh sanchaarit ho saktaa he
 "popov did one such experiment in Russia

 His second article was sent to Lord Royal in London in October 1895 by Lord Rayleigh
 disambar 1895 main, landan patrika electrician ne bose kaa lekh "ek nae electro-polariscope par" prakashit kiya
 At that time the term 'coherer' coined by Lodge in the English-speaking world was used for Hertz's wave receiver or detector
 electrician ne tatkaal bose ke 'kohirar' par tippanee kii
 
 The commentary quoted from the English magazine Electrician is: bose "apane kohirar" ko behtar karne kii yojana banaai lekin yah patent ke bare main kabhi nahin sochaa
 Bose conducted his experiments at a time when radio was developing as a contact medium
 radio microwave optics par bose ne jo kaam kiya tha wo radio communication se judaa hua nahin tha, lekin unke dwaara kiye hue sudhaar evam unke dwaara is vishay main likhe hue tathyon ne duusare radio avishkaarakon ko zarur prabhavit kiya tha
 In the late 1894 era, Guglielmo Marconi was working on a radio system that was being designed specifically for wireless telegraphy
 1896 ke aarambh tak yah pranali physics dwaara bataaye gaye range se zyaada duri main radio signlles transmit kar rahi thi
 Jagadish Chandra Bose was the first scientist to find out what the semiconductor junction was used to detect radio waves and discovered many microwave components in this method
 iske baad agle 50 saal tak millimetre lambaai kii electromagnetic tarango par koi shodh kaary nahin hua tha
 In 1897, Bose described his research on millimeter waves at the Royal Institution in London
 unhone apane shodh main vevagids, horn antena, daai -electric lens ,alag alag posraiser or semiconductor jinaki frequency 60 ghz tak thi -- unka istemaal kiya tha
 All these devices are still present at Bose Institute, Kolkata
 ek 1
3 mm multibeam resiver jo kii erizona ke NRAO 12 meter telescope main hai, acharya bose 1897 main likhe hue research paper ke siddhanto par banaaya gaya hai
 Sir Neville Mott received the Nobel Prize in 1977 for his research work in Solid State Electronics
 unhone yah kaha tha kii acharya jagadish chandra bose apane samay se 60 saal aage the
 In fact, it was Bose who predicted the existence of P-type and N-type semiconductors
 biophysics ke kshetra main unka sabase bada yogadan yah tha kii unhone apan dikhaaya kii paudho main uttejnaa kaa sanchaar vaidyuthik madhyam se hota hai naa kii chemical madhyam se
 These claims were later proven to be true through scientific proyogo
 acharya bose ne sabase pehle microwave ke vanaspati ke tishyu par hone vaale asar kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 He studied the effect of changing weather on plants
 iske saath saath unhone rasinic inhibitors kaa paudhon par asar or badalte hue taapmaana se hone vaale paudhon par asar kaa bhi adhyayan kiya tha
 By analyzing changes in cell membrane potential under different conditions, they came to the conclusion that plants are sensitive "they can feel pain, feel affection, etc
"
 bose ne alag alag dhaatu or paudhon ke tishyu par fatig rispance kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya tha
 He stimulated different metals by mixing electrical, mechanical, chemical and thermal methods and noted the similarities of the cell and metal reaction
 bose ke prayogo ne simulated koshikao or dhaatu main chakree fatig pratikriya dikhaai thi
 Along with this, special cyclic fatigues and recovery responses were also studied for different stimuli in living cells and metals
 acharya bose ne badalte hue electrical stimuli ke saath paudhon badalte hue electrical pratikriya kaa ek graph banaaya, or yah bhi dikhaaya kii jab paudhon ko zehar yaa anaesthetic di jaati hai tab unki pratikriya kaam hone lagati hai or aage chalakar shunaya ho jaati hai
 But the zinc metal did not show this reaction when it was treated with oxalic acid
 1917 main jagadish chandra bose ko "nite" kii oopaadhi pradaan kii gai tathaa sheeghra hi bhautik tathaa jeev vigyaan ke liye royal sosayadi landan ke faillo chun liye gaye

 Human beings are not imprisoned in permanent 'today'; They overcome and attain temporality
 jab manushya kaal se ubarte hai, loukikta khojate hai, or swayan ko aaj se mukt karte hai to duniya ke saath unke sambandh parinaam se yukt ho jate hai
 Humans do not have a normal earth in the world and with the world

 Due to the race for power, it seemed very difficult, because the rulers of these princely states were seeing the merger of their princely states into independent India as a second priority
 unki maang thi ki ve saalon se khud apane rajyon kaa shashan chalaate aa rahe hai, unhen iskaa dirghakaalin anubhav he, is kaaran unki riyasat ko 'swatantra rajya' kaa darja de diya jaae
