 jeevwad yaa sarvatmavaad vah darshanik, dharmik yaa aadhyatmik vichaar he ki aatma na keval manushyon main hoti he varan sabhi jantuon, vanaspatiyon, chattaanon, prakritik parighatnaon main bhi hoti he
 Going further than this, sometimes the words, names, analogies, metaphors, etc
, also speak of the existence of the soul
 sarvatmavaad kaa darshan mukhyatya adivasee samaajon main paaya jaataa he parantu yah shinto evam hinduon ke kuch sampradaayon main bhi paaya jaataa he
 There are often three types of beliefs or ideas prevalent among humans regarding soul, soul or organism
 kuch log to charvak ke anuyaayiyon kii tarah, shariron se swatantra yaa pruthak jeevon yaa atmaaon kii koi satta hi nahin maanate
 According to him, consciousness arises as a result of the actions of the root brain in the same way as bile from the liver; It is not a quality or form of a non-material element or substance called a creature or soul
 iske viruddh kuch logon ke vichaar main chetana bhautik tatwon se utpann nahin hoti, kintu bhautik padaarthon se vilakshan aatma yaa jeev kaa gun he
 For example, Jain thinkers, while acknowledging the independent existence of organisms, defined the organism in these words as "chetnlakshano Jeeva:"
 parantu aatma yaa jeev kii satta sweekaar karanevaale sab vyakti ek mat ke nahin
 They can be broadly divided into two classes
 ek to ve jo keval manushyon or kuch ucch koti ke pashupakshiyon main hi aatma kaa astitv sweekaar karte hai or duusare ve jo na keval manushyon or pashupakshiyon main hi apitu keet-patangon or ped-paudhon aadi main bhi, jinhen duusare log jad samajhate hai, aatma yaa jeev ke astitv par vishwaas karte hai
 This same type of belief or idea of human beings is called animism
 taarkik bhashaa main sarvatmavaad vah siddhant he jiske anusaar tathakthith jad padaarthon main bhi aatma yaa jeevatma namawale ek abhautik tatv yaa shakti kaa astitv sweekaar kiya jaataa he or use na keval buddhijivi praaniyon ke bauddhik jivan kaa apitu shaareerik athwa bhautik kriyaaon kaa bhi muladhar mana jaataa he
 As the Kāोपopanishad is from this shruti of "yonnyamnye Prapadyante Pritavatvaye Dehin: Sthastmanyenanusayati Yathakaram Yathashrutam" and from the "andeshu Peshish Tarushvnishneshtu Prano Jeevamupadhavati Tatra Tatra" from this verse and from the "indian" Both thinkers and Jain philosophers, vegetation etc
 real and earth Shri Adi has also believed in the existence of soul in movable roots
 at: unhen sarvatmavaadi vichaar kaa samarthak kaha ja saktaa he
 In fact, in trees, planets, subconscious, even unconscious things, people who believe in the power of soul or organism are still found in many countries, such as the cow of the world, which are often not only of spirits, especially of their dead ancestors, but of such souls
 They also worship people whom they do not understand as related to any particular body or object or to the deity of natural substances or arrogant deities
 Accept as
 aadhunik yug ke adhikansh vichaarak sarvatmavaad ko na keval bahu-ishwarwad kaa hi kintu susabhy maanav ke dharmik akeshwarwad kaa bhi aadharbhoot vishwaas samajhate hai or uski gananaa asabhy yaa ardhsabhy jatiyon ke dharm yaa darshan main karte hai
 According to him, totalism is just an unscientific faith of human beings
 ve use vishwa ke tathyon kii vyakhya karne kaa ek bauddhik praytn to maanate hai; parantu keval praarambhik yaa aparipakv praytn hi
 George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was a famous philosopher

 This active method uses a specially constructed message that must be inserted at a particular point in the protocol to allow the owner and slave to repeat the pairing process
 uske baad, pehali vidhi ko PIN bhedan ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 The major weakness of this attack is that it needs to bring the user of the device under attack so that it can be retrieved into the PIN when the device is prompted to do so as most commercially available Bluetooth devices are not capable of the expected time period Yes, this active attack probably requires custom hardware

 According to another definition, a hyperbola is a locus of points whose distance between two fixed points is always constant
 in nishchit binduon ko atiparavalay kii nabhiyaan kehete hai
 a hyperbola is a two dimensional plane curve defined by its geometric properties or equations
 ek atiparavalay main do bhaag hote hai, jinhen sanyugmi ghatak kaha jaataa he, jo ek-duusare kii darpan chhaviyaan hoti hai or donon anant lambey dhanush kii tarah hoti hai
 Hyperbola is one of three types of cone intersection, which is formed by a plane and a bicep intersection
 yadi ek samtal, ek dwishanku ke donon hisson ko pratichchhed karata he lekin vah samtal shankuon ke sheersh se nahin gujarata he, to shankav ek atiparavalay hota he 
 Hyperbola in geometry can be defined as a locus of points on the Euclid plane

 Usually the following type is represented as 2 a, a> 0: { \ displaystyle { \ displaystyle 2a, \ a> 0 \ :}} h = { p ∣ | | p f 2 | − | p f 1 | | = 2 a } 
 { \ displaystyle { \ displaystyle H= \ {P \ mid ||pf_{2}|-|pf_{1}||=2a \ } \ 
}} The mid-point m { \ displaystyle M} of the line segment joining the two nuclei is called the center of the hyperbola and this line segment is called the principal axis
 mukhyaksh par sheersh v 1 , v 2 { \ displaystyle { \ displaystyle V_{1}},V_{2}} hote hai jo centre se a { \ displaystyle a} duuri par hai
 The distance between the navel and the center is called c { \ displaystyle c} focal distance
 anupaat c a { \ displaystyle { \ displaystyle { \ tfrac {c}{a xxrep 4 } utkendrata e { \ displaystyle e} ke baraabar hota he
 the equation: atiparavalay kaa centre mulbindu, mukhyaksh x-aksh, tathaa nabhiyaan tathaa sheersh v 1 =, v 2 = 
 { \ displaystyle { \ displaystyle V_{1}=, \ V_{2}=}
} va nabhiyaan f 1 =, f 2 = { \ displaystyle { \ displaystyle F_{1}=, \ F_{2}=}} Then the equation of the hyperbola for any point on the hyperbola x 2 a 2 − y 2 b 2 = 1 
 { \ displaystyle { \ displaystyle { \ frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}}-{ \ frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}}=1 \ 
}} Eccentricity: e = 1 + b 2 a 2 
 { \ displaystyle { \ displaystyle e={ \ sqrt {1+{ \ frac {b^{2}}{a^{2 xxrep 5 } 
}} When a hyperbola contains a = b { \ displaystyle a = b}, it is called a right hyperbola

 Growth factors used to supplement the medium are often derived from animal blood such as calf serum
 a complication of these blood-derived materials is the potential for contamination of the culture with viruses or prions, particularly in medical applications of biotechnology
 Current practice is to minimize or eliminate the use of these materials wherever possible, but this cannot always be accomplished

 During the 1990s, as punch string bases became more widely available and more economical, a growing number of bassists ranged from metal to gospel to a lower range under the standard "E" wire - a lower " b "began to use the five-stringed instrument by adding strings
 Some bassists, who performed well in a single setting, used five-string bases, adding an elevated "C" tether as the fifth chord to achieve higher range

 In the first decade of the 21st century, some bass manufacturers incorporated digital modeling circuits inside instruments to reproduce the tones and sounds of many models of basses
 Traditional base designs such as the Fender Precision Base and the Fender Jazz Base continued to be popular in the first decade of the 21st century; a 60th Anniversary p-base was introduced by Fender in 2006, along with the introduction of the Fender Jaguar Base

 Tapewound and flatwound strings are sometimes used in a fretless base, so that the fingerprint is not worn by metal string circles
 Epoxy is applied to the fingers of some fretless bases to increase durability, enhance durability, and give a bright color

 pizoelactric pikup ek chumbakeey pikup kii tarah tantri ke saath sidhe paraspar kriya nahin karte, lekin kisi yantric kampan ko sanket main parivartit karte hai
 They are usually mounted under the bridge saddle or near the bridge and require a pre-amplifier for optimal sound
 kai beson main sirf ek pikup, aamtaur par ek "pi" yaa sopbaar pikup, hota he
 Multiple pickups are also fairly common, with the two most common configurations being a "P" near the neck and a "J" bridge, or two "J" pickups
 Two- "soapbar" configuration is also very common, especially on the basis of make, such as Ibanez and Yamaha
 a combination of other single coil pickups on a j or neck and a Music Man-style humbucker across the bridge has become popular among boutique manufacturers, a very clear, focused vocal that is good for jazz and thumbstyle

 a somewhat unusual configuration has been found in some custom basses used by Billy Sheehan, with a humbucker on the neck and a split coil pickup in the center
 pikup ke sthanan dhwani ko bahut prabhavit karata he
 a pickup near the neck joint emphasizes fundamental and low quality and thus produces a deep, buoyant sound, while a pickup near the bridge emphasizes higher order quality and a "tighter" or "faster" sound

 Base players like Jah Wobble play alternately standing and sitting
 yah vadak kii praathamikta kaa maamla he ki kaunsi avasthaa main use bajaane main adhik aasaani hoti he tathaa bed pradhan usase kya apeksha karata he
 In the seated position, right-handed players can balance the instrument on the right thigh, or on the left thigh like classical guitar players
 By balancing on the left thigh, such a situation is usually created as if the standing position is copied, thus there is not much difference between standing and sitting positions
 The balance of the base on the right thigh allows for better access to the neck and veil, especially to the underside, in its entirety
 ek khadey base ke vipareet, electric base guitar ko kshaitij sharir se aadaa pakad kar, ek electric guitar kii tarah bajaayaa jaataa he
 The index finger and middle are used when paring nerves with fingers

 Some bassists freeze their thumbs on the lower strings and remove them to play the lower strings
 vaikalpik rup se, anguuthe ko aprayukt tantriyon ko mook karne ke liye un par shithilataa se rakhaa jaataa he
 The string can be traced anywhere within the bridge and where the fretting hand is placed, different tones are produced depending on where the traction is performed

 Many bassists traverse the strings with the thumbs to emulate the sounds of the double bass and mute the strings with the palm to produce a "thumpy" tone
 swargeey monk montgomeri tathaa bruce paamar anguuthe kaa upyog karte the
 The use of the thumb was recognized in early models of fenders, which were introduced with a "thumbrest" or "tugbar" attached to the pickguard under the strings
 apane naam ke vipareet, is kaa upyog anguuthe aaraam dene ke liye nahin kiya jaataa tha, balki anguuthe se tantriyon ke karshan ke samay tech kaa kaam karata tha

 Bassists interpolate the left-handed muted "dead vocals" between slap and pop, often for intense forearm effect, and "hammer on", "pull off" or "fretting hand" from the fretting hand after the vocals are slapped or popped
 Other vowels are produced by a left-handed glissando
 slai and da family stone or graham central stesan ke laire graham slap style ke praarambhik pravartak the or da bros johnson ke louis johnson ko bhi slap vadak ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The slap and pop style was also used by many bassists in other genres such as rock, metal and fusion

 Picks are used for more pronounced shock, for speed, or simply because of personal preference
 haalanki ek pick kaa upyog praathmik rup se rock ke saath judaa he, pick kaa anya shaileyon main bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Jazz bassist Steve Swallow uses the pick for upbeat or funky songs, and Pink Floyd bassist Roger Waters for heavy vocals
 pick kaa upyog adhik susangat aghat ke liye ekantar downstroke or apstroke yaa sabhi downstroke main kiya jaataa he
 The pick is usually caught with the thumb and index finger plucking with the up and down movement of the wrist

 Different materials such as plastic, nylon and felt which all produce different tones are used for the pick
 ek fingerstil swar kaa anukaran karne ke liye felt pick kaa upyog kiya kiya jaataa he
 Palm muting is a widely used base technique
 picking ke samay picking haath kii hatheli brij par vishram karti he tathaa swar kii dirghta ko kam karte hue uskaa chupkaran karti he
 The harder the palm is pressed, or the more the area of the nerves touches the palm, the shorter the vibratory period of the string
 The duration of the played vowel can be changed to any vowel
 kam avadhi ke chup kiye gaye electric base ke swar ko ek khadey base kii swar avadhi or gun ke liye nakal kii ja sakati he
 Palm muting is commonly used when using a pick, but it can also be used when playing downstroke with the thumb without the pick
 pick / hatheli chupkaran sangyojan kaa ek prasiddh udhaaharan he paul macartni, jinhone is takanic kaa dashakon tak upyog kiya
 The sting also uses palm muting, but often does so without a pick, with a thumb and a finger
 pick / hatheli chupkaran sangyojan bhi saamanytah guitar par prayukt hota he
 Fretting Hands - The use of the left hand for the right-handed bassist and the right-hand straps for the left-hand bassist to generate different tones and to shape the rhythm and acoustics of the sounds produced by plucking or picking
 is done
 frating hand kaa upyog ek bajaae gaye swar ko, yaa to puri tarah chup karne yaa pluking athwa picking ke baad uski avadhi kam karne ke liye yaa swar kii tivrata kam karne ke liye brij ke paas aanshik chupkaran karne ke liye, yaa swar ko teji se samaapt hone dene ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Especially when the player wants to make a "dry" or "focused" sound, the fretting hand is often used to silence the nerves not being played and to stop the shivering vibrations
 duusari ore, sambandhit tantri kii anukanpi pratidhwani kii kisi geet ke liye jarurat ho sakati he jaise gaatha-geetika
 in maamalon main, ek besavadak sambandhit swaron ko hormonikali fret kar saktaa he
 For example, while a continuous "F" is played, an f gamut below is being played by a piano player, a bassist may hold the 'C' and 'F' below the note to indicate their multiplied vocals
 a sympathetic sound is emitted
 frating hand ek plak yaa pick kiye swar main prakampan, yaa to ek saumy, sankeern prakampan yaa ek adhik atiranjit badi tarata ke saath, vyapak prakampan jod saktaa he
 For the fretted basses, the vibrato is always an alternation between the vowel and a slightly higher pitch
 pardaarahit beson ke liye, vadak prakampan kii is style kaa upyog kar sakate hai yaa ve swar or ek thodi kam tarata ke bich prayaavartan kar sakate hai
 While vibrations are mostly "paused" vowels — that is, vowels that have been pressed on the fingerprint — open strings can also be vibrated by pressing the string behind the nut
 saath hi, frating hand kaa upyog ek plak yaa pick kiye gaye swar ko upar tarata main "modane" ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 To produce a reverse effect "bend down", the string is pushed to a high pitch before being plucked or picked and then allowed to fall to a regular pitch after ringing
 shaayad hi kabhi, ek besavadak samaan prabhaav utpann karne ke liye ek trimolo baar-sajjit base kaa upyog karata he
 In addition to pressing one vowel at a time, bassists may also inject multiple vowels at once with their fretting hands to demonstrate a vowel

 Another variation of pushing a string down completely is to gently tapping the string at the harmonic node point, which produces a chime-like upper multiplied tone
 mid ek prabhaav he jisamen frating hand gardan par upar yaa neeche sarakta he
 Without plucking or picking the string, a subtle mead can be performed at the speed of the fretting hand and the string is first plucked or picked for a more pronounced effect, or, in the context of a metal or hardcore punk, a pick is scraped along the side of the string
 frating hand kaa upyog swar bajaane ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he, yaa to ek khuli tantri ko frating hand se plak karke, yaa pehle se plak yaa pick kii hui tantri ke maamle main oonchi tarata par “hamering on” karke yaa ek neeche frated athwa khuli tantri ke swar ko plak karne ke liye "puling of" karke
 jaij besavadak frating hand kaa ek sookshm rup pigicato, pluking hand se tantri bajaane se thik pehle frating hand se khuli tantri par ek bahut hi sankshipt kan swar plak karke, upyog karte hai
 When rapid stringing is done on a string, the tone can be delayed for a long time in a trill
 do haath dohan shaileyon main besavadak pardaapatal par teji se tantriyon ko dabaakar or pakadakar swar bajaane ke liye donon haathon kaa upyog karte hai
 In this technique, instead of plucking or picking the string to produce a sound, the string is produced by hitting the string with a freight or freightboard

 metal main, base guitar lay guitar vadak ke saath jatil tukdon ko bajaata he yaa samooh kii aawaaj ko sthayitv dene ke liye ek neeche rambling pedal bindu par bajaate hai
 The bass guitarists also occasionally perform bass breaks or bass solos, dropping out of the strict rhythm section
 base brakes yaa base ekal ke liye prayukt besaline style ke anusaar parivartit hoti hai
 In a rock band, a bass break may include a riff or lick during the pause in the bassist's song

 Other contemporary composers such as Edo Castro have developed a new style with an electric base consisting of 4,5,6,7,8 and 9 strings, which is entirely centered around Pace
 electric base jaij kii duniya ke liye apekshaakrit navagantuk he
 The double base was used in all of the big bands of the Swig era of the 1930s and 1940s and the combo bihop and hard bop movements of the 1950s
 electric base 1960 ke dashak ke ant tathaa 1970 ke dashak ke aarambh main pesh kiya gaya tha tab rock prabhaavon ko jaij ke saath mishrit kar jaij rock sanlayanak kii rachana kii gai
 With the introduction of the electric bass in jazz fusion, like the rock world, the bass can also be used in stadium concerts with high intensity and powerful amplifiers, as it is much easier to amplify an electric base than a double base is 
 Jazz has both the accompaniment and solo roles of Electric Base
 sangat main, besavadak paaramparik dhunon or jaij maanakon ke liye dablebes kii nakal main komal quarter note line bajaakar ghoomte hue besaline kaa pradarshan kar saktaa he

 Contemporary classical music uses standard instruments of Western art music, and new instruments or sound-producing instruments or electrically amplified instruments to tape players and radios
 1960 ke baad se electric base guitar kabhi kabhi hi samakaleen shastreey sangeet main istemaal kiya gaya he
 Contemporary composers often acquired unusual sounds or instrumental vocals through the use of non-traditional instruments or playing techniques

 As the design of the telescope continued to improve, its utility in astrological research increased, but astronomy began in the second quarter of the 19th century, when the German physicist, Gustaf Robert Kirkhhoff, in the study of the sun and other starlight, The principles of spectrography propounded by is saadhan ke vikaas main photography se atyant sahaayta mili, kyonki isaki sahaayta se aalokit varncrampatt sthaayee rup se tulanaatmak adhyayan ke liye uplabdh hone lage
 The same photometry and means of measuring the intensity of the spectral lines provided invaluable information about the physical state of celestial bodies, aiding in the study of spectrometry
 jab koi gas jalaai jaati he tab, kirkhhof ke siddhant ke anusaar, vah shwet prakaash kaa vikiran na karke keval vishesh varnon ke prakaash kaa hi vikiran karti he
 These characters are called characteristic characters of gas
 in varnon main koun koun se varna prakat honge, yah us bhautik avasthaa main sthit deeptiman gas main se yadi shwet prakaash gaman kare, to shwet prakaash kaa varnakram santat nahin hota, varan usamen gas ke lakshanik varna anupasthit hote hai
 Additionally, if the temperature of the origin of white light is higher than the temperature of the gas, black lines, called Fraunhofer lines, appear in place of the characteristic characters of the gas in the spectroscope
 in kaali rekhaon ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki shwet prakaash kis kis gas main gaman karke varnakramdarshi tak pahunchaa he tathaa uske gas parmaanu kis bhautik avasthaa main hai
 Kirkhoff proposed this theory based on experiments
 parantu aage chalakar parmanurachana ke gyaan or kwantum siddhant kii sahaayta se varnakramiki ke niyamon kaa pratipaadan saidhantik rup se kiya ja sakaa
 It is clear from the above statement that there is a natural limit to the utility of spectral means in the study of astrophysics
 yah isliye ki varnakramdarshi padaarth kii bhautik avasthaa ke vishay main tabhi soochna de saktaa he jab yah padaarth deeptiman gas ke rup main ho
 Therefore, by this means it will not be able to know what substances are located in the path of light and what is their physical state
 khagoleey pindon se jo prakaash aata he vah uske aantarik bhaagon main utpann hota he, phir bhi un bhaagon kii rachana ke vishay main varnakramdarshi kii sahaayta se kuch bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 He is only able to give information about the gas circle that surrounds these bodies
 falat: in pindon ke aantarik bhaagon kii rachana tathaa bhautik avasthaa ke vishay main jaanane ke liye varnakramiki se bhinn sadhano kii aavashyaktaa he
 These tools will be described further
 agyayan ke sadhano ke vichaar se tarapind ko do mukhya bhaagon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he: aantarik bhaag or gasmandal Based on the study of the spectrum, many facts have been known about stars, the main of which is the following: surya tathaa anya taare deeptiman gas ke vishaal goleey pind hai, jinke aantarik bhaagon ke prishth kaa taap, jise prishthiya kehete hai, sahasron anshon tak hota he
 As the stars move towards the center of the star, the temperature increases; Even the central temperature is found to be several hundred thousand
 ? The interior of each star is surrounded by a gasosphere
 in gasmandalon main jo tatv pahachaane gaye he ve sab prithvi par bhi paae jate hai
 This does not mean that there will be no other elements here than those found on earth

 bhartiya jyotishi, meghnad saaha, ne san 1922 main apane prasiddh ooshmpyanan sutara kaa pratipaadan kiya, jisaki sahaayta se varnakram pattee kaa vaastavik tathy samajha ja saktaa he
 The Saha Sutra, after the visionary, is the most important invention in astrology, in the words of the famous British astrologer Eddington
 taare ke satat varnakram ke adhyayan se uskaa prabhavi taap nishchit kiya jaataa he
 In the exploration it is imagined that Tara is an ideal Krishna body, which means that its surface is organized in such a way that it completely absorbs all the radiation that falls on it
 kirkhhof or bailphor or stuart ne yah siddh kiya he ki yadi pind kii urja main parivartan na ho, to prayek varna main uske vikiran or avasorana kii matraayen ek vishesh anupaat main hoti hai
 The word Krishna has no relation to the visible color of the body
 aise pind ke saidhantik, athwa prayogtmak, adhyayan ne yah siddh kiya he ki vishesh taap par prayek varna kii tivrata nishchit hoti he
 Planck has formulated a formula based on thermodynamics, which suggests that in the state of thermodynamic equilibrium, there is a certain intensity of radiation of a character of the ideal Krishna body
 upar diya rekhachitr tarangadaidhray or vikiran kii tivrata main sambandh bataata he
 For a given temperature of the body, the limited area between the axis of the curve and the wavelength determines the total energy that the radiating star is emitting every moment in the sky
 in vakron se yah bhi spasht he ki pind ke taap main parivartan ke saath hi saath mahattam tivrata ke tarangadaidhray main bhi parivartan ho jaataa he
 In fact, as the temperature of the body increases, the wavelength of greatest intensity decreases, that is, it moves towards the visible part in the spectrum
 adarsh krishna pind ke liye plank niyam ke anusaar taap or mahattam tivrata ke tarangadaidhray ke sambandh ko prakat karanevaala sutara saralata se gyaat kar liya jaataa he
 Therefore, to determine the effective temperature of the star, firstly by studying its spectrum, the wavelength of radiation of greatest intensity is found
 taare kaa prabhavi taap vastav main us adarsh krishna pind kaa taap he jiske vikiran kii mahattam tivrata usee tarangadaidhray main he jisamen taare kii
 There is a large variation in the spectral text of the strings, but even if the main focus is on the main Fraunhofer lines, these spectra sheets can be divided into a few sections

 Some letters have been used in this classification, which have no special scientific basis except for convenience
 is vargeekaran ke mukhya varg o, ba, e, pha, ga, k tathaa m se chihnit kiye jate hai suvidha ke liye inamen se prayek varg das upvargon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 In practice, the square of a star is determined based on the intensity of the major absorption lines in its spectrum, which depend on both temperature and pressure
 at: vargeekaran main taap evam daab kaa prabhaav is prakaar vichaar me liya jaataa he ki adhikansh taare do mukhya shreniyon main vibhajit kiye ja saken : vishaal taare or vaaman taare or tab prayek shrenee main avasorana rekhaon kii tivrataayen itane niyamanusaar badalati hai ki di hui tivrataon ke liye taare ke varg kaa, falat: uske prabhavi taap kaa, nishchay anany rup se kiya ja saktaa he
 The temperature of a large star of a given square is less than the temperature of the star of the same class
 surya vaaman shrenee kaa sadsy he
 The following table gives the characteristics of effective heat and spectrum for the Vamana series wires corresponding to these classes: aage chalakar avishisht awalokit taron ko vargeekaran main sammilit karne ke liye is vargeekaran ke prarambh main varg va or ant main na, r tathaa sa virgon kaa yoga kar diya falat: prachlit vargeekaran is prakaar he: The spectral instrument also revealed that many stars, which appear alone in photographs taken by the greatest telescopes, are actually two stars, which revolve around their center of gravity
 in taron ko varnakramdarsheey yugmak taare kehete hai
 The spectral lines of radiant gas located in a magnetic field are much wider than the radiated lines in the normal state and are broken up into two and sometimes more sublines
 ise jeman prabhaav kehete hai
 Babcock found this effect to exist in the spectroscopes of some stars, on the basis of which he concluded that these stars had magnetic fields similar to the Sun
 taron ke bich ke sthaan main sampurna rup se padaarth kaa abhaav nahin he
 There is very diffused dust and corpuscles present there
 udaahranarth, akashganga main surya ke sameep prati ghan senmi0 main madhyat: ek hydrogen parmaanu prati ghan senmi0 or prati ghan kimi0 main 10-5 senmi0 ardhavyas ke lagbhag 25 pindkhand paae jate hai
 Thus the density of the substance located in this place is about 3-10-24 grams per cubic cm
 taron ke gasmandal main bhi padaarth kaa ghanatav lagbhag itnaa hi hota he
 This statement is not true about other parts of the galaxy
 ab yah nishchit rup se gyaat he ki prayek niharika ke bhinn bhinn bhaagon main ghanatv bhinn he
 The tendency of matter within the star is found to be present as dense clouds of gas
 in meghon kaa punj taron ke punj or kabhi kabhi vishaal taramandal ke punj, ke samaan hota he
 This cloud not only absorbs the light of the stars behind it, but also scatter it, due to which the light of the star starts to feel like blood color; For example, the molecules of the Earth's atmosphere scatter sunlight at dusk and give blood to the Sun
 is prakirnan kii maatra ke adhyayan se hi taare ke bheetar ke padaarth main vidyaman pindkhandon ke madhyapariman kaa nishchay kiya jaataa he
 As already written, there is no physical means of knowing the internal composition of the stars
 at: is sanghatan kaa adhyayan karne ke liye ganitiya sadhano kaa upyog karnaa padataa he
 a simple model of the inner part of the star, conceived of the observed material and the physical principles, is imagined and then the physical goals of this model are determined in the manner of mathematics
 yadi ye lakshan taron ke aalokit lakshanon ke samaan hon, to yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki taare ke aantarik bhaag main bhi waisi hi bhautik avasthaaen vidyaman hai jaisi praturup main
 How many such models have been studied
 iske falswaroop taron ke aantarik bhaag ke sanghatan ke vishay main samuchit gyaan praapt kiya ja sakaa hai
 Some types of star mass and their radius are known
 iske atirikt prayek taare kaa yah aavashyak lakshan he ki vah satat akaash main sab ore urja kaa vikiran karata rahata he
 The rate of radiation of energy, which is called the star's light, is as important as the star's mass and radius
 yadi taron ke punj or unte ardhvyaason kaa rekhachitr khinchaa jaae, to yah spasht ho jaataa he ki taare lagbhag teen bhaagon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai
 The drawing of stars and astrologers also supports this statement
 adhikansh taron ke liye unki jyoti punj ke lagbhag 3
5 ghaat ke anusaar vicharan karti he
