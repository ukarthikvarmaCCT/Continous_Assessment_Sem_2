 thos-avasthaa-electraniki kaa upyog karke vidyut shakti kaa parivartan evam niyantran se sambandhit gyaan ko shakti electronic kehete hai
 There have been revolutionary changes in the field of electrical energy due to power electronics
 aaj 10 wat se lekar kai sau megawatt ke motaron ko chalaane ke liye drive uplabdh hai
 Electric power up to 6 GW can be transmitted via high-voltage DC transmission of about 1000 kw
 railgadiyaan, alevator, or crinen sabhi shakti electronic ke dwaara hi aaraam se chal rahe hai
 Power is the only component in connecting renewable energy sources to the electric grid
 yahan tak ki radar pranali bhi shakti electronic par hi nirbhar he
 Although all small electronic components are used in power electronics, the following components are unique identities of power electronics
 shakti electronic ke kshetra main kaary, laghu-sanket-electraniki ke bhi pehle ho chukaa tha
 Electric machines were first used for the control and conversion of electric power
 iske baad mercury arq ractifire kaa prayog hua
 Then came the era of vacuum and gas-filled valves
 san 1957 main esasiaar ke vikaas se shakti electronic main ek nayi disha mili
 Nowadays, the use of switches like SCR, GTO, BJT, MOSFET, IGBT, etc
 is done very efficiently
 is kaaran shakti electronic kaa kshetra bahut vyapak evam mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 Electronics is the department of science in which electric power is efficiently converted to the desired voltage, frequency, current by using electron tubes or semiconductor devices performing similar functions
 vastav main baat yah he ki vidyut shakti hame jis rup main main praapt hoti he usee rup main vah bahut kam upyog main laayi jaati he
 For example, an industry receives electric power in the form of 415 volts, 50 Hz AC
 use vidyutlepan karnaa he jiske liye 0 se 20 volt disi chaiye jisamen se shunya se lekar 1200 ampir dhara bahegi
 It is clear that the power we are getting cannot be directly used for this work, rather it will have to be changed
 yah kaam shakti electraniki dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In fact, there are thousands of examples where electric power cannot be used as it is, rather it has to be changed to some other form
 electraneey yuktiyon main se mahatvapurn upyog ye hai : Many of today's most modern devices also cannot be made without electronics, such as radio, television, movies, fluorescence light, public lecture-system, telephone etc
 ye sab yuktiyaan electraniki kii hi dein hai
 Some of the industrial uses of electronics are briefly mentioned below: udyogon main bahudhaa rujukarak upyog main laae jate hai, jinase prayavarti vidyut-dhara nirdisht dhara main badali jaati he
 They are often of one of the following types: adhik shakti ke rujukari main bahukala rujukari paripathon kaa upyog ekkala rujukari paripathon ke upyog kii upeksha anek kaarnon se adhik laabhadaayak hota he
 The first reason is that nowadays electric power is produced and distributed in the form of tri-art-power
 dwitiya kaaran yah he ki bahukala rujukari dwaara utpann voltata ekkala rujukari dwaara utpann voltata kii apeksha adhik sam hoti he
 In the above mentioned high power loan, either the same loan is kept for many moneylenders or many money bankers, whose loan lines are connected, are used

 The speed of the motor is controlled exclusively in paper mills, because the thickness of the paper depends on the speed itself
 in yantron main exciter ke kshetra kii pravaati dhara main parivartan kiya jaataa he, jo janitr ke liye niyantrak kshetra kaa utpaadan karata he
 This generator is driven by a prime mover
 janitr kaa armechar apana utpaadan us motor ko detaa he jisaki chaal kaa niyantran karnaa hota he
 a sight-current generator is driven by this motor; It produces a voltage proportional to its speed
 yadi vah voltata purvanishchit voltata se bhinn hoti he to ek niamak ko sakriy kar detii he
 This regulator brings about such a change in the area of the exciter that the current of the motor falls to a predetermined value
 is niamak main anek naliyon kaa upyog hota he
 Thus with the help of electronics, the speed of the motor can be controlled to a minimum value

 By this method the work is very clean and an open flame is not present
 dhaatuon ko tapt karne ke kii vidhi ko preran-taapan tathaa achaalak vastuon ko tapt karne kii vidhi ko paravidhyut-taapan kehete hai
 Both of these methods require high frequency alternating current
 tapt kii janevaali dhaatu ke tukade ke chaaron ore ek kundali lapetakar usamen prayavarti dhara kaa pravaah karte hai
 The magnetic current generated by the current flows through the air and also through the metal present near the coil
 dhara ke utkraman se syand main bhi parivartan hota he, jiske kaaran dhaatu main voltata prerit ho jaati he
 Due to this voltage, a large amount of vortex current flows in the metal
 tab dhaatu ke pratirodh ke kaaran taap utpann ho jaataa he
 a power of 1,000 kilocycles or more than 1 meg of cycle is required to electrically conduct dielectric materials
 chunki vastu main hokar dhara pravaahit nahin ho sakati, isliye vastu ko ucch voltatawaale dhaatu ke platon ke bich main rakhaa jaataa he
 Due to the rapid change of the electric field, the changes in the molecule structure of the dielectric object also begin
 anuon ke bich main gharshan hone ke kaaran vastu main sab ore samaan taap utpann ho jaataa he
 By this method, thick sheets of dielectric objects can be heated in a very short time
 dhaatu ke do tukdon main ucch vidyut-dhara pravaahit karne se unako sandhanit kiya ja saktaa he, arthath mashin main ek sandhan parivartak rahata he, jo 220 yaa 440 volt kii vidyut kii do vidyut-dagron ke bich main se 1 se 10 voltmapi main parivartit kar detaa he or saath hi saath ucch vidyuddhara detaa he
 In order to make a break, it is necessary that the current flows only for a short time

 dhaatuon kii ksharankriya, jinamein yantric karkon ke falswaroop dhaatuon kaa hraas hota he, is kriya se bhinn hoti he
 Corrosion in metals is actually in the form of chemical action, or electrocatalytic action
 mul aadhaar ke anusaar uparyukt donon prakaar kii sanksharan kriyaayein mul kriya kii vibhinn avasthaaen hai
 There is a specific and essential deficiency in the free energy of the corrosion mechanism of metals
 pratyaksh rasinic kriya dwaara dhaatuon ke sanksharan main gas, athwa ardratayukta vaataavaran, kaa sansarg sanksharan ke liye upyukt paristhityaan utpann karata he
 In the electrocatalytic action of corrosion, suitable conditions are generated when metals are submerged in a fluid
 is prakaar sanksharan kriya main dhaatuon kaa vidyutracinic hraas hota he
 Corrosion of metals due to being submerged in them and liquids does not depend only on the above mentioned conditions, other factors also have a special and significant effect
 saamanyat: dhaatuon kii sanksharan kriya main nirmit honevaala antim utpaada aisa yogic hota he jo prakruti main khanij padaarth ke rup main paaya jaataa he
 For example, keeping the copper strip in an open state for many years in an interstitial environment, germs a layer of alkali sulfate on the top floor of the plate
 taanbe kaa yah ksharak sulphate prakruti main paae janevaale khanij brocatite jaisaa hota he
 Similarly, when iron or steel platen is completely submerged in saline water, a hard layer of hydrated iron oxide accumulates on its floor in the rain
 jalyojit ferick oxide prakruti main paae janevaale khanij gothit jaisaa hota he
 Thus, corrosion of metals is the action of alternation of metals in the intermediate metallic state to permanent oxidized state
 jo dhaatuen prakruti main apane shuddh rup main pai jaati hai, jaise swarna, unamem saamanyat: prakruti main upasthit karkon dwaara sanksharan kriya nahin hoti or iske falswaroop hi aisi dhaatuen asamyukt avasthaa main pai jaati hai
 On a structural basis, corrosion action affects metals in the following different forms: dhaatuon ke sanksharan nivaaran main saidhantik rup main un sabhi upayon evam karkon ko chhod dena padataa he jo sthaayee avasthaa ke prayaavartan ko protsaahit karte hai
 Such factors vary for different metals, but in general, oxygen and oxygen mixed solutions and soluble substances in water encourage the alternation of a permanent state
 sanksharan ke nivaaran main uparyukt karkon kaa purna bahishkaar praaia: asambhav hota he
 Therefore, in their presence self-sustaining actions are resorted to
 dhaatusanksharan kii vishesh paristhitiyon main sanksharan kii gati par adhiktam avrodh utpann karanevaale kaarak ko sanksharan kaa niyantrak kaarak kaha jaataa he
 Industrially important, almost all of the metal is exposed to the outer surface of the atmosphere by forming a visible, or non-visible, microscopic layer that affects subsequent corrosion processes
 saamanyat: yah parat khuli dhaatu ke oxide se nirmit hoti he
 Its properties are different from those of the parent metal, and the behavior of open conditions also leads to behavioral differences
 adhikansh paristhitiyon main oxide kii yah parat muldhatu ke sanksharan kaa nivaaran karti he
 When this type of thick layer breaks from somewhere due to transmission and contraction, then electro-chemical-corrosion starts at these places
 dhaatuon ke sanksharan ko nimnaankit chah bhaagon main vibhakt kiya jaataa he : Each of the above conditions has a characteristic in the corrosion process and different measures are taken to prevent it
 dhaatuon ke sanksharan nivaaran main vibhinn ritiyon kaa upyog hota he, jinamein nimnaankit pramukh hai : The ultimate method of corrosion prevention is most commonly used
 is reeti main dhaatu ke svachh bahya tal par oxide jaise prakritik nivarak adhilep kaa sambalan athwa uske sadrush prabhavotpadak kritrim adhilep padaarth kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 In this method of prevention by overlap, colorlap and other similar coatings are used, in which basic substances such as alkali chromate, lithharge, blood sis, red iron oxide, graphite, vituminite etc
 are prominent
 sanksharan nivaaran main galvanikaran, dhatukaneekaran, cement karan, vidyut nikshipt adhilep tathaa anya dhaatu adhilep kaa adhikadhik upyog hone laga he

 parantu vah donon kii padhai kaa bhaar vahan nahin kar paati he

 It was Charandas who killed his father
 charandas aag main ghi kaa kaam karata he or puuran ko jaaydaad ke bantwaare ke liye uksaata he
 Puran, sunken under the fold of sins, demands the partition of property
 bharat swechha se sari sampatti chhod kar bharat-paak yuddh main ladane chalaa jaataa he, jabaki puuran ek ore to anaaj kii kalabazari tathaa taskari kaa dhandha karata he or duusari ore sidhe sade gaanv waalon ko murkh banaata he
 In the battle, India is injured and caught by the enemy, but somehow gets out by dodging the enemy and injures his village
 raste main charandas zakhmi bharat ko maarane kaa shadyantr rachataa he, parantu malang chachaa, jo ki viklang he, usko bachaa letaa he or khud ghayal ho jaataa he
 Doctor Kavita plays an important role in saving the injured India and Malang Chacha
 udhar puuran ko bhi giraftaar kar liya jaataa he
 He realizes his mistake and he assists the government in arresting the people who do Gorakh business

 High noise-resistance and low static energy consumption are two important features of CMOS devices
 urja kii lakshaneey maatra keval tabhi lee jaati he, jab CMOS upkaran main transistors on va of avasthaaon ke bich swichan kar rahe hote hai
 As a result, CMOS devices, like other forms of logic, eg transistor-transistor logic or NMOS logic, which uses all n-channel devices without p-channel devices, do not generate much waste heat
 CMOS also allows a higher density of logical functions on a chip
 yahi mukhya kaaran he ki assi ke dashak main CMOS spardhaa main vijayi hua or VLSI chips main kriyanvayan ke liye sarvaadhik prayukt praudyogiki ban gaya
 The phrase "metal-oxide-semiconductor" refers to the physical structure of specific field-effect transistors, which consist of a metal door electrode on top of an oxide thermometer, which is again located on top of a semiconductor material

 voltage strot yaa dharaatal se output tak pathon ke nirmaan ke liye p-prakaar or n-prakaar ke dhaatu-oxide-ardhchaalak kshetra-prabhaav transistors kaa prayog hi CMOS paripathon ko logic gates ke kriyanvayan kii anumati dene vaala mukhya siddhant he
 When a path leading to the output is produced from a voltage source, the circuit is said to be pulled upward
 anya paripath avasthaa tab utpann hoti he, jab output tak jane vaala koi path dharaatal se nirmit kiya jaataa he or output ko sambhavya dharaatal tak neeche laayaa jaataa he
 CMOS circuits are constructed so that all PMOS transistors essentially have input from a voltage source or any other PMOS transistor
 Similarly, all NMOS transistors must also have inputs from ground or any other NMOS transistor
 The composition of a PMOS transistor creates a low resistance between its source and destination contacts when a low gate voltage is applied and a high resistance when a high gate voltage is applied
 duusari ore, kisi NMOS transister kii rachana strot va gantavy ke bich nimna get voltage lagu karne par ucch pratirodh or ucch get voltage lagu karne par nimna pratirodh utpann karti he
 The diagram on the right shows what happens when an input is connected to both a PMOS transistor and an NMOS transistor
 jab input a kaa voltage kam hota he, to NMOS transister kaa channel ucch pratirodh avasthaa main hota he
 This limits the current that can flow from q to the ground
 PMOS transister kaa channel nimna pratirodh avasthaa main he or aapurti se output tak bahut adhik dhara pravaahit ho sakati he
 Since the resistance between the supply voltage and q is low, the voltage drop between the supply voltage and q is also reduced due to a current taken from Q
 atah output ek ucch voltage pradarshit karata he
 On the other hand, when the voltage of input a is high, the PMOS transistor is in the off state, so it will limit the current flowing from the positive supply to the output, while the NMOS transistor is on, allowing the output to be grounded
 Permission to go towards
 chunki q or dharaatal ke bich pratirodh kam he, atah q ko dharaatal se upar rakhane par q main jane vaali dhara ke voltage main giravat kam hoti he
 This low degradation causes the output to display a low voltage
 sankshep main, PMOS or NMOS transistors ke output is prakaar sampoorak hote hai ki jab input nimna hota he, to output ucch hota he or jab input ucch hota he, to output nimna hota he
 Because of this inverse behavior of input and output, the output of the CMOS circuit is the inverse of its input
 kisi CMOS paripath ke PMOS transistors or NMOS transistors ke bich upasthit dwividhta isaki ek mahatvapurn visheshta hoti he
 a CMOS circuit is always designed to allow the presence of a path from the output to the power source or surface
 isaki purti ke liye, voltage strot tak jane vaale sabhi pathon kaa samooh dharaatal tak jane vaale sabhi pathon ke samooh kaa sampoorak hona chaiye
 yah kaary ek ko duusare ke NOT ke sandarbh main paribhaashit karke saraltapurvak kiya ja saktaa he
 Due to the logic based on De Morgan's principles, NMOS transistors corresponding to parallel PMOS transistors are sequential, while NMOS transistors corresponding to sequential PMOS transistors are parallel
 adhik jatil taarkik kaaryon, jaise AND tathaa OR gates ko shaamil karne vaale kaary, ke liye tark ko pradarshit karne hetu gates ke bich path main parivartan karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 When a path consists of two transistors placed sequentially, both transistors must have a low resistance to their respective supply voltage , creating an AND
 jab kisi path main samanaantar rup se lage do transistors shaamil hote hai, to aapurti voltage ko output se jodne ke liye donon main se kisi ek main yaa donon transistors main nimna voltage hona chaiye, jo ek OR kaa nirmaan karata he
 The circuit diagram of a NAND gate is displayed on the right in CMOS logic
 yadi a or b donon ke input ucch hai, to donon NMOS transistors sanchalit honge, donon main se koi bhi PMOS transistors sanchalit nahin hoga or output va Vss ke bich ek suchalak path sthapit hoga, jisase output nimna ho jayega
 yadi a athwa b main se koi input nimna he, to ek NMOS transister sanchalit nahin hoga, ek PMOS transister hoga or output tathaa Vdd ke bich ek suchalak path sthapit hoga, jisase output ucch ho jayega
 One advantage of CMOS over NMOS is that both low-to-high and high-to-low output conversions are faster because the resistance between pull-up transistors is lower when the NMOS logic is turned on as opposed to the load registers
 is
 iske atirikt, nimna tathaa ucch patariyon ke bich output sanket purna voltage par jhulata he
 This powerful, more closely symmetric response also makes CMOS more noise resistant

 This example shows a NAND logic device as the physical display it will produce
 The physical layout perspective is the "bird's-eye view" of a group of layers
 paripath ek P-prakaar ke adhbstar par nirmit kiya gaya he
 Polysilicon, diffusion, and n-well are called "basic layers" and are actually inserted into P-type substrate layers
 ye sampark aadhaar paraton or dhaatu kii pehali parat ke bich ek rodhak parat ko bhedakar sangyojan banaate hai
 nand's inputs are polysilicon
 CMOS tranzistors policilicon or visaran ke pratichhedan dwaara banate hai: n upkaran ke liye n visaran; p upkaran ke liye p visaran 
 output dhaatu main judaa hota he
 The connections between metal and polysilicon or diffusion are made through contacts
 The example of the physical layout corresponds to the NAND logic circuit given in the previous example
 n upkaran kaa utpaadan ek P-prakaar ke adhbstar par kiya jaataa he
 The P-device is produced in an N-type coupe
 ltch-ap ko rokane ke liye ek P-prakaar kaa adhbstar "tap " VSS se joda jaataa he or ek N-prakaar kaa n-well tap VDD se joda jaataa he
 CMOS logic consumes less power than NMOS logic circuits because the CMOS only takes power when switching
 In a modern 90 nanometer process, switching output to a specific ASIC can take 120 picoseconds, and will be every ten nanoseconds
 Whenever the output is low, the NMOS logic dissipates power, as there is a current through the load resistor and n-type networks from Vdd to Vss
 jab bhi CMOS paripathon kaa swichan kiya jaataa he, to ve vibhinn bhaar dharitaaon ko aaweshit karke vidyut nasht karte hai

 The CMOS gates located at the end of those resistive wires see slow input conversion

 Both NMOS and PMOS transistors have a gate-source threshold voltage, below which the current flowing through the device decreases drastically
 aitihaasik rup se, CMOS dizine unke simarekha voltage se bahut adhik aapurti voltage par kaary karte the

 Such compositions, which involve a large amount of circuits, consume power due to this leakage current even if they are not actively switching
 risaav vidyut aisi rachanaaon dwaara prayukt kul vidyut kaa ek bada bhaag hoti he
 Further technology advances, which use more thin gate dielectric, have an additional leakage component due to the tunneling of the stream through extremely thin gate dielectric

 Paradise Lost is an epic poem by an Anglo poet named John Milton

 dryn ne thode hi samay ke baad is abhipraay ke saath waapas kar diya ki is purush ne ham logon ko to nicha dikhaaya hi, saath hi puraane kaviyon ko bhi parrast kar diya
 This epic begins with a concise explanation: how man is deprived of heaven as a result of divine disobedience, and how Satan, the root cause of man's grief, rebels from God because of heaven Is removed iske baad shaitan narkasthit agnimay talab main pade hue apane anuyaayiyon ko dekhtaa he
 He awakens his brave comrades and once again threatens the fight
 parantu is khabar ko sunakar ki ek nai duniya utpann kii gai he vah isi ke satya kaa gyaan praapt karne kaa nishchay karata he
 Satan himself departs for this new world
 ishwar shaitan ko dekhtaa he, maanav ke vishay main apane putr ke saath vichaar vinimay karata he, uske patan kii bhavishyavaanee karata he or ant main uski mukti kaa upaay nishchit karata he
 At the same time, Satan enters the solar system
 or vahaan nae sansar ke magar kaa pataa lagaakar swarg main chalaa jaataa he
 There he eavesdrops on the conversation between Adam and Eve why God has banned them from losing the fruit of the tree of knowledge
 aanevaali aapatti ke vishay main adaam ko satark karne ke liye rafel ko bheja jaataa he jo shaitan ke vishay main adaam ko sab baaten sunaata he
 Satan enters the body of a snake and sees Eve in solitude and starts speaking with her
 saanp ko manushyavaanee main bolte hue sunakar ive ko bada hi aashcharya hota he
 The snake tells him "" i tasted the fruit of the tree of knowledge and from this i gained the power and knowledge to speak immediately
 "" kautuhal se ive ko swayan fal khaane kii ichha hoti he or vah adaam ko bhi use khaane ke liye protsaahit karti he
 Michael is sent to drive Adam and Eve out of heaven
 adaam tathaa ive nirupay hokar swarg se baahar kar die jate hai
 Thus the epic ends
