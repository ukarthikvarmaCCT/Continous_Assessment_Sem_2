 Bahadur Shah Zafar was the last emperor of the Mughal Empire in India and a noted poet of Urdu
 unhone 1857 kaa pratham bhartiya swatantraaa sangram main bhartiya sipaahiyon kaa netritv kiya
 After the defeat in the war, the British sent him to Burma where he died
 jafar kaa janm 24 aktubar, 1775 main hua tha
 His father was Akbar Shah II and mother Lalbai
 apane pita kii mrityu ke baad jafar ko 18 sitambar, 1837 main mughal badshaah banaaya gaya
 It was a matter of fact that by that time the Sultanate of Delhi had become very weak and the Mughal emperor had remained a nominal emperor
 bharat ke pratham swatantraaa sangram main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane kii jafar ko baari keemat bhi chukaani padi thi
 His sons and great-grandchildren were publicly roasted by the British authorities
 yahi nahin, unhen bandi banaakar rangoon le jaaya gaya, jahaan unhone saat november, 1862 main ek bandi ke rup main dam todaa
 He was buried near the Shvedagon Pagoda in Rangoon
 unke dafan sthal ko ab bahadur shah jafar dargah ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Even today, when a patriotic person travels to the then Burma, he does not forget to pay tribute to Zafar's tomb
 logon ke dil main unke liye kitna sammaan tha uskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki hindustan main jahaan kai jagah sadakon kaa naam unke naam par rakhaa gaya he, vahiin pakistan ke lahore shahar main bhi unke naam par ek sadak kaa naam rakhaa gaya he
 Victoria Park in Old Dhaka city of Bangladesh has been renamed Bahadur Shah Zafar Park
 1857 main jab hindustan kii aazaadee kii chingaari bhadki to sabhi vidrohi sainikon or raja-maharaajaaon ne unhen hindustan kaa samraat mana or unke netritv main angrejon kii eent se eent baja di
 Bahadur Shah Zafar also got angry after seeing the rebellion of Indian soldiers against the British and called for the British to be driven out of India
 bharatiyon ne dilli or desh ke anya hisson main angrejon ko kadi shikast di
 Initial results favored the Indian warriors, but later, due to the deception of the British, the stand of the first freedom struggle changed and the British managed to suppress the rebellion
 bahadur shah jafar ne humayun ke makbare main sharan lee, lekin major hads ne unhen unke bete mirza mughal or khijar sultan va pote abu bakar ke saath pakad liya
 The British crossed all limits of oppression
 jab bahadur shah jafar ko bhukh lagi to angrej unke saamne thali main paroskar unke beton ke sir le aae
 He replied to the British that the sons of India sacrifice their heads for the country and come to their father in the same manner
 aazaadee ke liye hui baghawat ko puri tarah khatm karne ke makasad se angrejon ne antim mughal badshaah ko desh se nirvasit kar rangoon bhej diya
 Bahadur Shah Zafar was not only a patriotic Mughal emperor but also a famous Urdu poet
 unhone bahut si mashhoor urdu kavitaayen likhin, jinamein se kaaphi angrejon ke khilaaf baghawat ke samay machi uthal-puthal ke dauraan kho gai yaa nasht ho gai
 The lines written by him in Urdu are also very famous - ,,, Ek aisa ghar chahiye mujh Ko jiski faza mastana Ho Ek kone mein ghazal ki mahfil Ek kone mein maykhana Ho
 ,,, desh se baahar rangoon main bhi unki urdu kavitaaon kaa jalawaa jari rahaa
 He was always worried about India there
 unki antim ichha thi ki vah apane jivan kii antim saans hindustan main hi len or vahiin unhen dafnaaya jaae lekin aisa nahin ho paaya
 i do not think that my desolation is in love, what is made of alam-e-naapidar bulbul ko bagbaan se na saiyaad se gilaa,kismat main kaid likhi thi fasal-e-bahaar main
 Tell them to settle somewhere else from these haunts, where is this place in dil-e-daagdar
 ek shaakh gul pe baith ke bulbul he shaadamaan,kaante bicha die hai dil-e-laal-e-zaar main
 Age-a-drawer had brought four days of demand, two were cut in the beginning, two were waiting
 din zindagi khatm hue shaam ho gai,failaa ke paanv soyenge kunj-e-mazaar main
 How much is it for unfortunate 'zafar' dafn, two gaz zameen not found in ku-e-yaar bahadur shah jafar jaise kam hi shaasha hote hai jo apane desh ko mahabuuba kii tarah mohabbat karte hai or ku-e-yaar main jagah na mil paane kii kasak ke saath pardes main dam tod dete hai
 This was the basic difference with the fundamental Indian ideology which considers its country as its mother
 badshaah jafar ne jab rangoon main karawas ke dauraan apni aakhri saans lee to shaayad unke labon par apni hi mashhoor ghazal kaa yah sher jarur rahaa hoga- "kitna he badanaseeb jafar dafn ke liye, do gaj jameen bhi na mili ku-e-yaar main
 " bharat ke pratham swatantraaa sangram main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane vaale antim mughal badshaah bahadur shah jafar urdu ke ek bade shaayar ke rup main bhi vikhyath hai
 His poetry was filled with patriotism rather than sentimental poets and this was the reason that he warned the British rulers to walk to Shamsheer of Hindustan till the planks-london
 janashrutiyon ke anusaar pratham swatantraaa sangram ke baad jab badshaah jafar ko giraftaar kiya gaya to urdu jaanane vaale ek angrej sainya adhikari ne un par kataaksh karte hue yah sher kaha- "dam main dam nahin, ab khayr maango jaan kii e jafar ab myaan ho chuki he, shamsheer hindustan kii

!!" is par jafar ne karaara jawaab dete hue kaha tha- "hindio main bu rahegi jab talak imaan kii, takhte landan tak chalegi teg hindustan kii

!!" Zafar, called the last emperor of the Mughal period in India, was made the emperor of Delhi during the First War of Independence
 badshaah banate hi unhone jo chand aadesh die, unamem se ek tha gohatya par roak lagaana
 This order shows how big he was for hindu-muslim unity
 gorakhpur vishvavidhyalay main itihaas ke purv praadhyaapak dow shailanath chaturvedi ke anusaar 1857 ke samay bahadur shah jafar ek aisi badi hasti the, jinka badshaah ke taur par hi nahin ek dharmanirpeksh vyakti ke rup main bhi sabhi sammaan karte the
 That is why it was very natural that the soldiers who reached Delhi after revolting from Meerut made Bahadur Shah Zafar their king first
 chaturvedi ne baatcheet main kaha ki jafar ko badshaah bananaa sankethik rup se british shaskaon ko ek sandesh tha
 Under this, the Indian soldiers wanted to give the message that the Indian ruler would be in power at the center of India, not foreign
 badshaah banane ke baad bahadur shah jafar ne gohatya par pabandi kaa jo aadesh diya tha vah koi nayaa aadesh nahin tha
 Rather, Akbar had given similar orders during his reign
 jafar ne mahaj is aadesh kaa paalan phir se karwaanaa shuru kar diya tha
 Another aspect of Zafar's personality was poetry, along with Deshprem
 unhone na keval gaalib, daag, momin or jock jaise urdu ke bade shaayaron ko tamaam tarah se protsaahan diya, balki vah swayan ek achche shaayar the
 According to literary critics, during the time of Zafar, where Mughal power was in decline, Urdu literature especially Urdu poetry was at its height
 jafar kii maut ke baad unki shaayari "kulliyaat e jafar" ke naam se sankalit kii gayi

 In the governance of ancient India, there were employees called Dharma Mahamatra or Dhamma Mahamatra whose task was to establish 'dharmanushasan'
 kautilya ke arthshaastra main "dharm mahamaatr" jaise karmchaariyon kaa ullekh na hona is baat kaa suchak he ki ye karmchaaree chandragupta maury ke baad hi dharm kii abhivruddhi ke liye niyukt kiye gaye honge
 This is also corroborated by Ashoka's fifth verse article which states that in the 14th year of his rule for the Dharmanushasana he appointed a royalist named "dhamma Mahamatra"
 ye karmchaaree pehle kabhi rajya main niyukt nahin kiye gaye the
 The duty of Dharma Mahamatras is also specified in the fifth record, which is as follows- shaskeey vyavhaar main dharm mahamatro kaa kaary atyant saraahneey tha; kyonki vah keval samaaj ke avaanchhneeya tatwon kaa nirodh hi nahin karte the, balki apane mridu vyavhaar or gyaan se dharm kii maryaada sthapit karne main shashan kii shakti sudrudh karte the
 It is clear from this that any other interpretation of the Dharma Mahamatra — as scholars like Dr
 Vincent Smith, etc
 — Smith refers to the Dharma Mahamatra as "the Inspector" —is not appropriate

 Ambedkar put his political vision in front of the world during the first round table conference on 8 August 1930 in London, according to which the protection of the exploited class is in its independence from both the government and the Congress
 hamen apana rasta swayan bananaa hoga or swayan


 raajnneetik shakti shoshito kii samasyaon kaa nivaaran nahin ho sakati, unka uddhaar samaaj me unka uchit sthaan paane main nihit he
 They have to change their bad way of living 


 They must be educated 


 a great need is to shake their sense of inferiority and to instill in them the divine dissatisfaction which is the source of all heights
 ambedkar ne congress or gandhi dwaara chalaaye gayi namak satyagrah kii aalochana kii
 Due to the increasing popularity and public support among his untouchable community, he was also invited to attend the second round table conference in London in 1931
 vahaan unki achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene ke mudde par gandhi se tikhi bahes hui
 But Brido agreed with Ambedkar's ideas
 dharm or jati ke aadhaar par pruthak nirvaachika dene ke prabal virdohi gandhi ne ashanka jataai, ki achhuton ko di gayi pruthak nirvaachika, hindu samaaj ko vibhajit kar degi
 Gandhi felt that the Savarnas should be given some period of their heart-rending to forget untouchability, but this argument was proved wrong when untouchability continued to be practiced by the upper-caste Hindus even decades after the Poona Pact
 1932 main jab britishon ne ambedkar ke vichaaron ke saath sahmati vyakt karte huye achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The announcement of the Communal Award was the result of discussions at the Round Table Conference
 is samjhaute ke tahat ambedkar dwaara uthaai gai rajnatik pratinidhitiv kii maang ko maanate hue pruthak nirvaachika main dalit varg ko do voton kaa adhikaar pradaan kiya gaya
 Under this, Dalits could choose their representative by one vote and by another vote, there was freedom to choose representative of general class
 is prakaar dalit pratinidhi keval daliton kii hi vot se chunaa janaa tha
 With this provision, there was no longer any interference from the general class in choosing the Dalit representative
 lekin vahiin dalit varg apni duusari vot kaa istemaal karte hue saamaanya varg ke pratinidhi ko chunane se apni bhoomika nibhaa saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the Dalit candidate selected by the Dalits could have kept the problems of Dalits well, but it was not necessary for the non-candidate to try to solve their problems
 gandhi is samay puna kii yeravada jail main the
 As soon as the announcement of the communal award, Gandhi first wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and demanded that it be changed
 lekin jab unako laga ki unki maang par koi amal nahin kiya ja rahaa he to unhone maran vrath rakhane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Then Ambedkar said that "if Gandhi had kept this fast for the freedom of the country, it would have been good, but he has kept this fast in protest against the Dalit people, which is very regrettable
" jabaki bhartiya isaayiyo, musalamaanon or sikhon ko mili isi adhikaar ko lekar gandhi kii ore se koi aapatti nahin ai
 "he also said that Gandhi is not an immortal person
 bharat main na jane kitne aise logon ne janm liya or chale gaye
 Ambedkar said that he cannot renounce the interests of Dalits to save Gandhi's life
 ab maran vrath ke kaaran gandhi kii tabiyat lagaataar bigad rahi thi
 Gandhi's life was in great distress
 or puraa hindu samaaj ambedkar kaa virdohi ban gaya
 Seeing the increasing pressure in the country, Ambedkar reached Yerwada jail at 5 pm on 24 September 1932
 yahaan gandhi or ambedkar ke bich samjhauta hua, jo baad main puna pact ke naam se janaa gaya
 In this agreement, Ambedkar announced to waive the right to separate electorate received by the Dalits in the Communal Award
 lekin iske saath hin communal award se mili 78 arakshit siton kii bajaay puna pact main arakshit siton kii sankhya badha kar 148 karvaa lee
 Along with this, for the untouchables, adequate amount was allocated in education grant in every province and ensured the recruitment of Dalit people without any discrimination from government jobs and in this way Ambedkar saved the life of Mahatma Gandhi
 ambedkar is samjhaute se asamaadhani the, unhone gandhi ke is anshan ko achhuton ko unke raajnneetik adhikaron se vanchit karne or unhen unki maang se peeche hatane ke liye dawaab daalane ke liye gandhi dwaara khelaa gaya ek naatak qaraar diya
 In 1942, Ambedkar rejected this agreement, 'state of Myanority' has also expressed Poona Pact's displeasure in this book

 isamen unhone muslim lig kii musalamaanon ke liye ek alag desh pakistan kii maang kii aalochana kii
 It also argued that Hindus should accept Muslims from Pakistan
 unhone prastaavit kiya ki muslim or gaiyr-muslim bahumat vaale hisson ko alag karne ke liye punjab or bengal kii prantiy simaaon ko phir se taiyaar kiya janaa chahie
 He thought that Muslims could have no objection to retaking the provincial boundaries
 agar unhone kiya, to ve kaaphi "apni maang kii prakruti ko samaj nahin paae"
 Scholar Venkat Dhalipal said that Thoughts on Pakistan "stopped Indian politics for a decade"
 isane muslim lig or bhartiya rashtriya congress ke bich samvaad ke paathyakram ko nirdhaarit kiya, jo bharat ke vibhaajan ke liye rasta tay kar rahaa tha
 Although he was a staunch critic of the divisive communal strategy of Mohammad Ali Jinnah and the Muslim League, he argued that Hindus and Muslims should be separated and Pakistan should be formed because to lead the same country, due to ethnic nationalism More violence will develop within the country
 unhone hindu or musalamaanon ke sampradayik vibhaajan ke bare main apane vichaar ke paksh me automon samrajya or checkoslovakia ke vighatan jaisi aitihaasik ghatnaon kaa ullekh kiya
 He asked whether sufficient reasons existed for the establishment of Pakistan? And suggested that differences between Hindus and Muslims might have been possible to eradicate even with a less drastic step
 unhone likhaa he ki pakistan ko apane astitv kaa auchity siddh karnaa chaiye
 Communal issues have always been there even in countries like Canada, but even today the British and French live together, so can't Hindus and Muslims also live together
 unhone chetaya ki do desh banane ke samaadhaan kaa vaastavik kriyanvayan atyant kathinaayee bharaa hoga
 With the transfer of large population, there will also be a problem of border dispute
 bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad hone vaali hinsa ko dhyaan main rakh kar kii gai yah bhavishyavaanee sahi thi
 "what Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables?" With this book, Ambedkar sharpened his attacks on both Gandhi and the Congress, accusing them of hypocrisy

 ek maanav se hin samajha gaya or jiskaa sparsh maatr pradooshan failaane kaa paryaapt kaaran he? Ambedkar was also a great critic of the practices of Islam in South Asia
 unhone bharat vibhaajan kaa to paksh liya par muslimo main vyaapt bal vivaah kii pratha or mahilaon ke saath hone vaale durvyavhaar kii ghor ninda kii
 They said, bahuvivaah or rakhel rakhane ke dushprinaam shabdon main vyakt nahin kiye ja sakate jo vishesh rup se ek muslim mahila ke dukh ke strot hai
 Take the caste system itself, everyone says that Islam should be free from slavery and caste, while slavery exists and got support from Islam and Islamic countries
 jabaki quran main nihit gulaamon ke nyaay or maanviya upachaar ke bare main paigambar dwaara kiye gaye nuskhe prashansaneey hai, islam main aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo is abhishaap ke unmoolan kaa samarthan karata ho
 Even if slavery ends, caste system will remain among the Muslims
 unhone likhaa ki muslim samaaj me to hindu samaaj se bhi kahi adhik saamaajik buraaiyaan he or musalmaan unhen " bhaichaare " jaise naram shabdon ke prayog se chhupate hai
 He also criticized the oppressive curtain practice of oppression of women in Muslim society as well as the discrimination against the Arzal classes by Muslims who were considered "lower class"
 unhone kaha haalaanki pardaa hinduon me bhi hota he par use dharmik manyata keval musalamaanon ne di he
 He criticized bigotry in Islam due to which the society has become very fanatical due to the lack of literate adherence to the laws of Islam and it is very difficult to change it
 unhone aage likhaa ki bhartiya musalmaan apane samaaj kaa sudhaar karne main vifal rahe hai jabaki iske vipareet turki jaise deshon ne apane aapako bahut badal liya he
 Both Hindu and Muslim groups suffering from "communalism" have ignored the demand for social justice
 10-12 saal hindu dharm ke antargat rahete hue babasahab ambedkar ne hindu dharm tathaa hindu samaaj ko sudhaarney, samta tathaa sammaan praapt karne ke liye tamaam praytn kiye, parantu savarna hinduon kaa hryday parivartan na hua
 On the contrary, he was condemned and even called the destroyer of Hindu religion
 useke baad unhone kaha tha kii, “hamane hindu samaaj main samanta kaa str praapt karne ke liye har tarah ke praytn or satyagrah kiye, parantu sab nirarthak siddh hue
 There is no place for equality in Hindu society
 ” hindu samaaj kaa yah kahana tha ki “manushya dharm ke liye hai” jabaki ambedkar kaa maananaa tha ki "dharm manushya ke liye hai
 "ambedkar said that such a religion has no meaning in which humanity has no value whatsoever
 jo apane hi dharm ke anuyaayion ko dharm shiksha praapt nahin karne detaa, naukari karne main baadha pahunchaata he, baat-baat par apamaanit karata he or yahan tak ki pani tak nahin milane detaa aise dharm main rahane kaa koi matlab nahin
 Ambedkar did not declare any renunciation of Hinduism for any kind of enmity and destruction of Hinduism, but he decided it with some fundamental principles which were totally incompatible with Hinduism
 13 oktober 1935 ko nasik ke nikat yevala main ek sammelan main bolte hue ambedkar ne dharm parivartan karne kii ghoshnaa kii, "although i am born as an untouchable Hindu, i will not die as a Hindu at all!" unhone apane anuyaayiyon se bhi hindu dharm chhod koi or dharm apnaane kaa aahvaan kiya
 He also reiterated this in several public meetings across India
 is dharm-parivartan kii ghoshnaa ke baad hyderabad ke islam dharm ke nizaam se lekar kai isai mishnariyon ne unhen karodon rupee kaa pralobhan bhi diya par unhonen sabhi ko thukraa diya
 Of course, he also wanted that the economic condition of the Dalit society should improve, but not by being dependent on the money, but by their hard work and organization
 iske alaava ambedkar aise dharm ko chunanaa chaahate the jiskaa kendra manushya or naitikta ho, usamen swatantraaa, samta tathaa bandhutav ho
 In any case, he did not want to adopt a religion which is riddled with apartheid and untouchability, nor did he want to choose a religion which has superstition and hypocrisy
 ambedkar ne dharm parivartan kii ghoshnaa karne ke baad 21 varsh tak ke samay ke bich unhone ne vishwa ke sabhi pramukh dharmon kaa gahan adhyayan kiya
 The main reason for his taking such a long time was that he wanted more and more followers to convert with him at the time he converted
 ambedkar buddha dharm ko pasand karte the kyonki usamen teen siddhanton kaa samanvit rup miltaa he jo kisi anya dharm main nahin miltaa
 Buddhism teaches wisdom, compassion and equity
 unka kahana tha ki manushya inhen baton ko shubh tathaa aanandit jivan ke liye chahta he
 God and soul cannot save society
 ambedkar ke anusaar sachcha dharm wo hi he jiskaa kendra manushya tathaa naitikta ho, vigyaan athwa bauddhik tatv par aadhaarit ho, na ki dharm kaa kendra ishwar, aatma kii mukti or moksh
 At the same time, he said that the work of religion should be to rebuild the world and not to explain its origin and end
 vah janatantric samaaj vyavastha ke pakshdhar the, kyonki unka maananaa tha aisi sthiti main dharm maanav jivan kaa maardarshak ban saktaa he
 He got all these things in the only Buddhism
