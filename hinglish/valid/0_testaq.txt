 bihar main outsorcing seva main kota system lagu kiya gaya he
 The decision was taken by the state cabinet on Wednesday
 guuruuvaar ko is maamle par shrey lene kii hode shuru ho gayi
 Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav claimed that this was actually his idea, which Nitish Kumar is working to implement
 ek sanvadata sammelan main tejasvi ne ye daawa thokate hue kaha ki agar kisi ko vishwaas naa ho to mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke saamne puch saktaa he
 Tejashwi said that even before when the appointment was going on in Bihar Development Mission, he had advised to take appointment keeping in mind the social situation, which was also considered
 filhal nitish kumaar ke saat nishchay ke kriyanvayan main bihar vikaas mishan kii ahm bhoomika he
 According to the resolution passed by the state cabinet, now any company in Bihar, whose service is being taken by the state government, will have to give fifty percent reservation to that company
 jisamen anusuchit jati ke logon ke liye 16 pratishat, ati pichhadaa varg ke liye 18 pratishat, pichhadaa varg ke liye 12 pratishat, pichhadaa varg kii mahila ke liye teen pratishat or anusuchit jan jati ke liye ek pratishat aarakshan hoga
 Certainly, every party does not want to lag behind in taking credit on the steps taken by the Nitish Kumar government
 khaaskar rajd kaa akalan he ki nitish ne panchayaton main ati pichhadi jati ke logon ko aarakshan dekar rajya kii raajnneeti main apni jad or majboot kii he
 The comments isliye tejasvi yadav ne nitish kumaar se maang he ki agar centre jatigat aarakshan kaa aankada saarvajanik nahin karata tab khud kaa surveykshan karakar garib logon ke liye alag bajet banaaya jaay
 But now it has to be seen that what is the reaction of Nitish Kumar on these claims of Tejashwi
 vahiin jediu netaaon kaa kahana he tejasvi kaa yah daawa ki nitish kumr ko unhone ne hi idia diya tha, haasyaaspad he
 Tejaswi's claims have become like the dreams of Mungeri Lal nowadays as he thinks anything and starts claiming
 rajya cabinet dwaara paarit prastaav ke anusaar ab bihar main kisi bhi company, jisaki seva rajya sarkaar dwaara lee ja rahi he, us company ko pachaas pratishat aarakshan dena hoga
 There will be 16 percent reservation for Scheduled Castes, 18 percent for Backward Classes, 12 percent for Backward Classes, three percent for Backward Class Women and one percent for Scheduled Castes
 nishchit rup se nitish kumaar sarkaar dwaara uthaae gaye qadam par har dal credit lene main peeche nahin rahanaa chahta
 The RJD in particular assesses that Nitish has strengthened his roots in state politics by giving reservations to the people belonging to the most backward castes in the panchayats
 tippaniyan That is why Tejashwi Yadav has demanded from Nitish Kumar that if the Center does not make the data of caste reservation public then a separate budget should be made for the poor people by conducting a survey of themselves
 lekin ab dekhnaa yah hoga ki tejasvi ke in daavon par akhirkaar nitish kumaar kii kya pratikriya hoti he
 At the same time, JDU leaders say that Tejashwi's claim that he gave the idea to Nitish Kumar is laughable
 tejasvi ke daawey aajkal mungery laal ke hisan sapane kii tarah ho gaye hai kyonki vah kuch bhi soch lete hai or daawa karne lagate hai
 Certainly, every party does not want to lag behind in taking credit on the steps taken by the Nitish Kumar government
 khaaskar rajd kaa akalan he ki nitish ne panchayaton main ati pichhadi jati ke logon ko aarakshan dekar rajya kii raajnneeti main apni jad or majboot kii he

 Thus, it is an attempt to hide the deficiency

 The ground reality of government claims to provide full security protection to employees of agencies engaged in development work is that under Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), not a single contractor was found in last three years for construction of 92 roads in 10 districts of the state 
 iske alaava rajya peedblyoody kii 44 sadakon kaa nirmaan kaary lambey samay se adhar main he

 82 crore source: The effect of the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana and the State Government Maoists' strategy of not allowing the road to be built is that even the policemen stationed in a dozen police stations in Dantewada, Bijapur, Narayanpur and Kanke districts have to send ration by helicopter
 jahaan police kii suraksha kaa yah haal he, vahiin shiksha or swasthya jaisi pariyojnaon kaa to puri tarah bedaa gark he
 If you look at the figures of PMGSY, the length of roads that the contractor cannot find is 689 km
 jin sadakon ke liye thekedaar nahin mil rahe unamem bastar main 3, dantewada main 37, kanker main 25, rajanandgaanv main 5, narayanpur main 3 or bijapur main 19 sadaken shaamil hai
 These 10 districts are those which have been notified by the Central Government as Naxal Districts
 yahi nahin, rajya kii rajdhani raipur ke mainpur ilaake kii teen sadaken bhi naksaliyon kii vajah se rukii hui hai
 Five of the 10 affected districts are from Bastar division itself
 inamen dantewada ke liye pichley paanch saal se 37 sadaken sweekrut hai
 The department has invited tenders 10 times, but no contractor is getting ready to work
 isi tarah kankavr kii 25 sadaken hai
 a contractor in Pakhanjur area of kankavra started road construction last month when Naxalites set fire to a dozen of his machines
 gauratlab he ki yah haal tab he jab mukhyamantri raman singh ne pichley saal june main 170 karod ru
 It was said that construction of new roads and providing full protection to the employees of agencies engaged in this work
 lekin khud mukhyamantri ke pramukh sachiv evam jansampark ayukta en
 Baijendra Kumar believes that it has become difficult to build a road in Bastar due to Naxalite panic
 kaam main adnga daalane ke liye naksali thekedaaron kii gaadiyaan jala daalate hai
 Contractors are intimidated
 maovadiyon ke aatank ke kaaran nirmaan companiyaan bastar main kaam karne se peeche hat rahi hai
 Baijendra Kumar said, "working in Bastar is not easy
 phir bhi suraksha cover dekar sadaken banane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The impact of the Naxalites' strategy of not allowing the roads to be built is widespread
 dantewada, bijapur or narayanpur, teen aise jile hai, jahaan jila mukhyalayon tak hi sarkaar kaa kanoon chalata he
 a parallel government of Naxalites runs outside this
 pichley saal bijapur jila mukhyalay se aath kimi dur barudi surang visphot kar naksaliyon ne siarpief ke aath javaanon ko maar daalaa tha
 Due to lack of roads, there are more than 300 villages of Bastar, where no government representative has reached in the last ten years
 dantewada, bijapur, narayanpur or kankavr jile ke darjan bhar thane aise hai, jahaan helicopter se rashan kii supplai kerani padati he
 If the soldiers want to go home on leave, they are sent by helicopter to the district headquarters

 Polling parties are also sent by helicopter in elections

 The health department in the state has provided smart cards to the poor under the National Health Insurance Scheme
 baaki jilon main jahaan 50,000 se lekar 1
 Up to 5 lakh smart cards have been made, while not a single card could be made in Bijapur
 dantewada main bhi maatr 9,631 card bane hai
 Sub health centers are approved in Naxal-affected areas, but buildings are not being built
 bastar main hi 599 up swasthya kendron ke paas na to apni imaarat he or na hi imaaraton ke nirmaan kii disha main koi pahal dikhaari de rahi he
 Where there are hospitals, doctors are unable to dare to go
 masalan, dantewada main visheshgy chikitsakon ke 36 pad sweekrut hai, inamen mahaj do hi doctor tainaat hai
 Six posts of Block Medical Officer are lying vacant
 isi tarah chikitsa adhikari ke 79 pad main se 56 khaali hai
 In Bastar district, 149 posts of doctors are approved but only 49 doctors are working here
 dantewada main doctoron ke 141 pad hai, jabaki tainaati mahaj 24 doctoron kii he
 Bijapur has 65 posts, but only 14 doctors are posted
 yahi haal shiksha vibhaag kaa he
 There are 77 hostels and school buildings to be built in Bastar district
 inamen se 57 bhawanon kii pariyojnaayen manjuur bhi hai
 The construction of more than 100 school and hostel buildings in Narayanpur and Bijapur districts is also pending
 vibhaag tay sthanon par skool nahin bana paa rahaa he, isliye ab aise surakshit sthanon par skool banane kaa faisla kiya gaya he, jahaan tak sadak jaati he
 Is it only the terrorists of the Maoists or is the government also guilty? On this question, the opposition Congress state president Nand Kumar Patel said, "development works are stalled in Bastar due to neglect of the government
" adivaasiyon ko nunatam suvidhaayen nahin mil rahi
 Schools and hospitals remain closed
 naksaliyon kii aad main sarkaar ne adivaasiyon ko apane haal par chhod diya he
 Patel says that nothing will happen until the central government declares Bastar a disturbed area and takes control
 jald hi congress ke vidhayak raashtrapati or pradhanmantri se milane vaale hai
 The state government does not yet have a concrete strategy to build these roads

 pandeya ke is bebas bayaan se hoti he
 Pandey said, "the effort is on, work should start somehow
" '' lekin is koshish main nayaa kya hoga, yah ve nahin bataa sake
 Significantly, the Government of India for these roads is 213 crores
 manjuur kar chuki he
 On the other hand some experts of the department say that there is a Naxal problem, lack of willpower among the officers is also a big reason for not building the road
 naksal prabhavit ilaake main thekedaar kaam nahin kar sakate, isliye do saal pehle sarkaar ne khud kaam karne ke liye kendriya gramin vibhaag se ijaajat maangi thi
 Permission has been received from the center
 magar is disha main abhi tak koi pahal nahin hui
 There is also a shortage of staff in Bastar
 vahaan jane ke liye koi taiyaar nahin hota
 Due to this, more than 50 percent of the posts are vacant
 neeche ke karmchaariyon kii to or kami he, jo nigaraanee kaa kaam dekhte hai
 Says a former CEO who worked at PMGSY, "roads can be built one by one if full force is employed by applying force
 ''bastar jile main to pimgsavai ke saath hi rashtriya rajmarg kaa nirmaan bhi adhar main lataka hua he
 Looking at this area, the project started here in the year 2001
 lekin pariyojna main 2008-09 ke baad koi nayaa kaam sweekrut hi nahin ho sakaa he
 The biggest reason for this is being told that the old works are not completed
 nae kaam ke liye detail project report bhi ab jaakar taiyaar ho saki hai
 If you look at the figures, in the last ten years, under this scheme alone, under the Jagdalpur division, by the year 2008-09, approval was given for the construction of 511 roads under which a total of 2,753 km of roads were to be constructed
 isamen 4,400 se zyada pul-puliyon kaa nirmaan bhi hona tha
 Since most of the areas are in Naxalite areas, only 1911 of these bridges and culverts can be built
 2,500 ke kareeb pul-puliyon kaa nirmaan ab bhi adhar main hi he

 Chandel said, "due to the panic of Maoists, most of the contractors are not coming for work
" police kii suraksha ke baad bhi thekedaar kataraate hai kyonki ek baar suraksha lene ke baad ve hameshaa ke liye hit-list main aa jate hai

 Pakistan's great fast bowler Wasim Akram has backed the controversial rotation policy of Indian cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 unhone kaha ki is kadam ke peeche ‘acha kaaran’ he kyonki senior khilaadi yaa to ‘uske niyantran main nahin’ hai yaa phir ve ‘boj’ ban gaye hai
 Dhoni's statement that senior players are slow in fielding had triggered speculation that there were differences in the Indian dressing room
 akram ne kaha ki dhoni kaa bayaan bilkul vaastavik najariya he
 The former fast bowler said, "from my point of view Dhoni is a very sensible person and i completely agree with him because he says what he thinks
 uske bayaan ke peeche nishchit taur par kaaphi acha kaaran hoga
 i have never seen Dhoni speaking this way
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki yaa to senior uske niyantran main nahin hai yaa phir ve boj ban gaye hai
 Former Pakistan captain Akram also believes that Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag will have to be physically fit to remain in the ODI format
 akram ne saath hi team chayan main coach dancan flachar kii bhoomika par bhi sawaal uthaae
 He said, 'if i were the coach, i would have sent the best batsman to start the innings
 gautam gambhir shrinkhalaa main ab tak do baar 90 se adhik ran bana chukaa he or vah sarvshereshth uplabdh salaami ballebaaj he
 It is for the team management to decide who will be its opening partner
 ’unhone kaha, ‘isse aapako baayen or daayen haath ke ballebaaj kaa sangyojan bhi milegaa
 In the match against Sri Lanka, we saw that both the openers battling poor form started the innings and your best batsman came to bat at number three
 to phir coach rakhane kaa kya phayda agar vah faisla hi nahin kar paae

 aatankwaadiyon ko funding rokane kaa pakistan kaa daawa ek baar phir se duniya ke saamne benakaab ho gaya he
 Pakistan's move to stop funding terrorist organizations is not embracing the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
 efeetief ke kshetreey sahyogi asia pacific group (APG) ke ek delygation ne pakistan main aatanki sanghathanon ke khilaaf thos karrwai nahin karne par nakhushi or gambhir chintaa jaahir kii he
 The delegation believes that Pakistan did not take strong action at the grassroots level to stop the funding and activities of terrorist organizations
 yah delygation pratibandhit aatanki sanghathanon ke khilaaf karrwai kii samiksha karne ke liye teen divasiy daure par pakistan pahunchaa hua he
 Delegation will leave Pakistan today
 mana ja rahaa he ki yah delygation pakistan se ravaanaa hone se pehle ek aupchaarik chetavanee bhi jari kar saktaa he
 The Pakistani newspaper Dawn quoted a senior official as saying that the delegation considered the first two days of his visit a good move by the federal government to enact legislation, collect data and issue notifications
 haalanki aatankiyon ko funding rokane ke liye prantiy or jila str par koi karrwai nahin hui
 These banned terrorist organizations are actually conducting their terrorist activities at the provincial and district levels
 delygation moolyankan report ke liye pakistan ke daure par he
 On Thursday, the delegation can finalize its report
 delygation se pakistan ke pratibhuti or vinimay ayog, vittiya nigaraanee unit, kanoon pravartan, khufia agenciyon, videsh or grih mantralay ke adhikariyon ke alaava neshnal counter terrorism athurity, fedral investigeshan agency, prantiy counter terrorism departments ke adhikariyon ne mulaakaat or baatcheet kii
 Let us tell you that FATF put Pakistan in the gray list because of funding and sheltering terrorists
 is list main pakistan ko daalane kaa matlab he ki paak mani londring or aatankwaad ko funding rokane ke liye kargar kadam uthaane main vifal rahaa he
 In such a situation, if the delegation expresses dissatisfaction in its review report this time, then it will be difficult for Pakistan to get out of the gray list
 yah pakistan ke liye bada jhatka hoga
 The FATF monitors cases of funding terrorists

 The Election Commission considers the case of partition in the Congress as the most proven and ideal case ever
 teen binduon ke aadhaar par sapa kii ladaai kaa faislachunaav ayog ne congress ke maamle main teen test ke aadhaar par apana faisalaa sunaaya tha or sutron ke mutabik, ayog ab isi aadhaar par samaajawaadee party kaa vivaad bhi sulajhaayega
 In its detailed decision, the Election Commission then examined the claims of both Congress groups on the basis of three tests
 pehla test- chunaav ayog ne congress ke samvidhan ko aadhaar banaate hue dekha tha ki donon samoohon main se kisne party samvidhan ke niyamon kaa paalan nahin kiya
 s Nijalingappa claimed the Congress only on the basis of the party constitution
 doosraa test- chunaav ayog ne duusare test ke taur par dekha tha ki kis samooh ne congress samvidhan ke lakshya or uddeshy kaa paalan nahin kiya
 The Commission found that neither of the two groups had challenged the aims and objectives of the party, that is, both had met the case
 teesraa test- jab do test ke aadhaar par chunaav ayog koi faisla nahin kar paaya, to ayog ne bahumat ke test ko aadhaar banaaya
 The Election Commission ascertained the party organization and the majority of both groups in Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha
 chunaav ayog ne dekha ki jagjivan ram ke samooh ko sanghathan or loksabhaa-vidhansabha ke adhiktar logon kaa bahumat hasil he
 The Congress was divided into two camps regarding the presidential candidate
 Let us say that in 1969, the Indian National Congress was divided into two groups for the selection of the candidate for President
 inamen se ek gut pradhanmantri indira gandhi ko samarthan karne vaala congress 'je' ke rup main tha
 The group was chaired first by C
 Subrahmanyam and later by Jagjivan Ram
 vahiin doosraa group congress 'o' kaa tha, jiskaa netritv es
 Nijalingappa was in his hands
 nizlingappa vibhaajan se pehle ke bhartiya rashtriya congress ke adhyaksh bhi the
 On December 21, 1969, C
 Subrahmanyam wrote a letter to the Election Commission stating that the Congress Working Committee had removed s Nijalingappa from the post of President and handed him the command of the party
 haalanki ayog ko baad main jaankaree di gai ki subrahmanyam kii jagah jagjivan ram ko adhyaksh bana diya gaya he
 So Nijalingappa claimed in the Election Commission that both the leaders were dismissed from the party
 chunaav ayog ne donon khemon ke vivaadit daawey kii jaanch karne ke baad 11 janvari, 1971 ko jagjivan ram kii congress ko asli congress mana or use chunaav chihn aavantit kar diya
 This is by far the most important case
 congress ke us vibhaajan kii ahmiyat1969 main hua congress kaa vibhaajan or chunaav ayog dwaara kiye gaye iske niptaare ko aise masalon ke liye ab tak kii sabase ahm cese study mana jaataa he
 The Election Commission gave its decision on this matter in one year 20 days
 is dauraan ayog ne kai mahatvapurn logon se baat kii or maukhik saboot ko record kiya
 The Commission also spoke to big people like Dr
 Shankar Dayal Sharma and Morarji Desai and gave a decision in the Congress case
 donon ne baad main kramash: raashtrapati or pradhanmantri pad ko sushobhit kiya
 When the Nijalingappa group reached the Supreme Court against the decision of the Election Commission, the Election Commission's decision was also there and the Supreme Court on the basis of it
 supreme court ne kaha ki bahumat or ginati kaa test loktantric sanghathan main moolyawaan or uchit he
 Thus, since this case of Congress, the basis of majority in the organization and Lok sabha-vidhan Sabha is considered to be certified, level and ideal for the settlement of disputes of political parties
 sutron kii maane to samaajawaadee party ke vibhaajan or chunaav chihn par daawey ke maamle main bhi chunaav ayog congress ke adarsh cese ko hi aadhaar banayega

 Many Sikhs were also killed in Kanpur during the 1984 anti-sikh riots
 is dange ko 33 saal biit gaye, lekin ab bhi dangon kii jaanch main gadabadiyon ke saboot saamne aa rahe hai
 Talking about Kanpur only, dozens of Sikh riots were victimized in many police station areas, but no FIR has been filed yet
 kuch jagah bina exiaar ke hi muaavja tak baant diya gaya
 This hearing is also pending in the Supreme Court
 court ne buudhvaar ko hui sunwaayee main saaf kaha ki 11 disambar ko centre or upi sarkaar ab tak kii gai karrwai kii silband report pesh kare
 That is, how much compensation was given and who was punished
 akhil bhartiya danga peedit raahat cameti ne is bare main saboot jutaaye hai
 According to committee chairman Kuldeep Singh Bhogle, 15 Sikhs were killed in Kakadev police station area of kanpur
 isaki tasadeeq artiai yachika par sarkaar ke jawaab se hoti he, lekin thane ke record main 1984 main oktober ke aakhri din or november ke dauraan hatya kaa ek bhi mukadmaa darj nahin he
 Incharge of the police station says that there is no case of murder in our records
 sikh virdohi mukademe darj hai bhi to aagjanee or danga fasaad karne kii dhaaraon main
 The police say that there is no FIR, whereas the report of the Nodal Officer of Riot Relief in the district says that 15 Sikhs were killed in those riots
 ab faisla sarkaar or adaalat ko karnaa he ki gadabad kahaan he or koun kar rahaa he
 At the same time, one FIR is registered in the second police station Najirabad
 isamen ek shaks kii hatya kaa cese bhi darj kiya gaya he
 But here it is difficult that in the third month of the incident i
e
 in January 1985, a closure report was also filed and the case was shelved
 yani 90 din kii miyaad main jahaan chargeshit daakhil hoti he vahaan to jaanch agency (upi police) ne maamle kii file hi nipta di
 The reality here is that 11 people from the same family were killed
 siddhu parivaar ke in sadasyon kii hatya ke jurm main koi exiaar darj nahin
 Without FIR, the families of the six deceased have received compensation of Rs five lakh each
 is paanch-paanch lakh rupye muaavje kii dilachasp kahani he
 They have received this compensation earlier, who have received the assistance amount of three and a half lakh rupees earlier
 yani baad main sirf dedh lakh rupye mili
 Avatar Singh Hite of the All India Riot Victims Relief Committee, who was involved in the investigation of this case, said that the BJP did politics by raising Sikh sentiments
 centre or rajya main ab tobijepi sarkaarhai
 No SIT was formed nor investigation of these disturbances started so far
 hamaara bharosa to uthanaa hi he
 Akali leader Kuldeep Singh Bhogle says that this is the reality of only two police stations in a city
 aise kai shahar or mohalle hai jahaan maut or khauf kaa nanga naach hua tha
 Nothing has happened in these 33 years in the name of punishment
 sarkaar congress kii ai or bijepi kii bhi
 Our party remained with the government in the hope that something will happen, but so far nothing has happened other than just hollow claims and promises

 bombai hoicourt ne ipel kii deccan chargers team ke management or phans ko raahat dete hue kaha he ki jab tak court dwaara niyukt kiya gaya madhyasth apni kaarywahi puri nahin kar letaa, deccan chargers kii team ko ipel-6 se nikaalane ke bisisiai ke faisle par roak lagi rahegi, haalanki hoicourt ne deccan management ko 9 oktober se pehle 100 karod rupee kii ankandishnal bank guarantee jamaa karne ke liye kaha he
 The High Court has also said in its decision that during IPL-6, Deccan team management will have to pay the team's players as well as support staff and franchise fees
 court ne kaha ki yadi adaalat ke madhyasth kaa faisla bisisiai ke paksh main jaataa he to bhi faisle ke baad saat din tak deccan team par koi karrwai nahin hogi
 The court made it clear that the Deccan team would be required to make all payments related to IPL-5 to BCCI before 31 October, including hotel bills as well as travel expenses of the players
 hoicourt ne yah bhi spasht kar diya ki yadi deccan management 9 oktober se pehle 100 karod rupee kii bank guarantee nahin detaa, to yah faisla lagu nahin hoga
 In fact, Deccan Chargers had moved the court against the removal of him from IPL-6 by the BCCI
 shuruaati sunwaayee ke dauraan bisisiai ne court ko jaankaree di ki deccan kii vittiya haalat thik nahin he, or usne yes bank ko team chalaane kii ijazat de di he
 The BCCI said that if Deccan could not run the team, it should have returned the franchise
 is par deccan ne apane bachaav main adaalat ko bataaya ki vah team chalaane ke liye patibaddh he or usne samay se pehle hi team ke kharchon par hone vaali laagat juta lee he
 Although Deccan also confessed in the court that his financial condition is not well at present, but many banks have asked him to give assistance
 tippaniyan After hearing both the sides, the High Court said, "the BCCI took all the decisions in haste in the entire process of expelling the Deccan team from IPL-6
" bisisiai ke kisi bhi charan main deccan management ko apana paksh rakhane or unhen vittiya madad dene vaale bainkon ke kisi bhi patr kaa jawaab nahin diya gaya
 Such decisions of BCCI point towards wrong attitude and unilateral decisions towards Deccan team
 hoicourt ne saath hi yah bhi kaha ki hamen aisa lagata he ki bisisiai ne deccan ke khilaaf faisle gadabadi main isliye liye, kyonki unhen dar tha ki agar deccan apane vittiya vaadon ko puraa nahin kar paaya to antarrashtriya str par unki badanaami hogi

 hollywood film 'blike panther' 2018 kii hit filmon main se ek he
 The film has broken many records at the box-office, but a student has fooled his professor by making a presentation on the film
 darasal, us student ne 'blike panther' main bataae gaye desh vakanda par 11 minute kaa pregentation de diya
 Although there is no such country in reality, it is surprising that its professor took it for granted
 Box office: ayyaari se doguni kamai kar chuki he ye hollywood filmustudent ne micro bloging site Reddit par apana pregentation share kiya or apane professor ke bare main bataaya- 'wo tivi par sirf tennis dekhati hai isliye unhen blike panther ke bare main kuch nahin pataa
 He did not know about this film until we told him

 He then asked me questions about it
 tab maine unke kaha ki main is desh or iske power stregal par pregentation duungaa
 She was very keen to know about a country she had not heard of
 ' These days Ganeshotsav is celebrated in Maharashtra
 lakhon gharon se lekar hazaron saarvajanik pandalon main bappa viraaje hai
 In many places the idol is of Plaster of Paris, in many places the clay is used to save the environment, but in Akola, Vinayak has been prepared in a special way
 maharashtra ke akola main vir bhagatsingh ganesh mandal ne chande ke taur par jamaa kiye puure 11 lakh rupee or usee se bana di bappa kii pratimaa
 This form of Lumbodar has been realized by a Divyang artist
 1000-1000 ke noton ko canvas par paper pin se jodne vaale akola ke gavalipura parisar ke rahane vaale tillu towri hai
 Notes ranging from 10 rupees to thousand rupees have been installed in this statue
 is rup ko saakaar karne main tillu ko 15 din lag gaye
 The district administration and the police had earlier refused to approve this unique statue, but the administration allowed it when the members of the mandal agreed to take over the safety of their idol
 lambodar ke is rup ko ek divyang kalakaar ne saakaar kiya he
 There are Tillu towers of Akola's Gavalipura campus connecting 1000-1000 notes with paper pins on canvas
 is pratimaa main 10 rupee se lekar hazaar rupee tak ke note lagaaye gayi hai
 It took Tillu 15 days to realize this form
 is anuthi murti ke liye pehle zila prashasan or police ne manzuri dene se manaa kar diya tha lekin jab mandal ke sadasyon ne apni murti kii suraksha kaa jimmaa khud lene par hami bhari to prashasan ne isaki ijazat de di
 India registered their best ever performance in the Asian Games at the 2018 Asian Games, winning a total of 7 gold, 10 silver and 2 bronze medals in athletics
 lekin jaisaa ki kaha jaataa he, yah to keval shuruyaat he
 Take a look at our junior talents: Neeraj Chopra, Hima Das, Saritaben Gaikwad, Vismaya, p
 you
 Chitra, Swapna Burman, all are under 24 years of age
 inamen 18 saal kii hima to sabase yuva he
 All these young players are yet to reach their peak, yet two of them have already won gold medals at the international level
 2016 main niraj poland main vishwa junior athletics championships main swarna padak jeetne vaale pehle bhartiya bane
 He also set a new world record in that category with a win in Javelin Throw
 phir july 2018 main hima ne finland main mahilaon kii 400 meter kii daud jitkar under 20 vishwa championships main bharat ko trek spardhaa main ab tak kaa pehla gold medal dilaayaa
 In the Asiad, India would have added eight gold medals to their account, but they outscored African athletes from two West Asian countries, some of whom were the best in the world
 in africa athleton ko baahar kar den to hamaare khate main 15 gold, 4 silver or 1 kaansya padak hote
 There is a lot of discussion in the media about the legitimacy of African athletes representing Asian countries, but we must set our goals high — on the stage of the World and Olympic Games — and we should be able to compete, whether they are African or somebody else
 hamaari 400 meter kii mahila chaukadi or jinson johnson or manjit singh ne yah sabit kiya ki ve behtareen khiladinnon ko maat de sakate hai
 Apart from the commitment, perseverance, determination and tireless efforts of these athletes, my emphasis is that teamwork, efficient long-term planning and effective implementation have been instrumental in achieving this performance, including selection committee, trainers, managers, Doctors, Physiotherapists and Athletics Federation of India (AFI) staff played a big role
 hamen sarkaar or bhartiya khel praadhikaran kaa bhi shukriya adaa karnaa chahie jinhone athleton ko prashikshan or pratispardhaa main bhaag lene kii taiyaari kii suvidhaayen uplabdh karaane main sahyog diya
 The Olympic Cell, a mission created by the government to help athletes, sat every week to provide continued financial support
 log is pradarshan se hairat main hai, haalanki hamaare athleton kii tarakkee par nigaah rakhane vaale kisi bhi vyakti ko iskaa pehle se anumaan rahaa hoga—2012 main 12 athlete hi landan olympic ke liye kwalifai kar paae the
 Then 34 athletes qualified for the 2016 Rio Olympics
 yah paimaana he khamoshi se hasil is tarakkee ko maapne kaa
 In the first Asian Games in 1951, India won ten gold medals in athletics
 phir 1978 main hamaare khate main keval saat medal the
 Now to understand this we need to remember that India had the advantage of being the host country, first in 1951 and then in 1982
 phir 1951 main bahut kam deshon ne usamen bhaag liya tha (keval 11 jabaki 2018 main jakarta khelon main 45 deshon ne hissaa liya tha)
 After that, we also have to keep in mind China's rise as a sporting power in the 1980s
 saal 1990 ke beijing khelon main bharat ko keval 4 rajat padak or do kaansya padak mili the
 Then at the 1994 Hiroshima Games, China and Japan together defeated everyone and we got only one silver and two bronze medals
 usase pehle jab 1978 main bhartiya athlete saat gold medal jitkar desh laute the to china va japan kaa khelon main itnaa dabadabaa nahin tha
 After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, when the Central Asian countries like Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan became part of Asia, the Asian Games became stronger
 ab kuch pashchim asian deshon ke africa athleton ko kharidkar unhen apane dal main shaamil karne se muqabla or kadaa ho gaya he
 Indians are proud of their performance in Jakarta
 nijee taur par mere liye bhi yah gaurav kaa vishay he ki hamen trek and field main international gold medals hasil hue or vah bataur mere eex adhyaksh rahete
 i am sure that with teamwork we will be able to finish better in the Olympics
 lekin ek chetavanee bhi he ki is manzil ko hasil karne kaa rasta bahut chunauti bharaa he

 On Sunday, Satrol Khap in Narnaund town of Hisar district overturned the tradition of over 650 years, freeing the marriage bond from khap boundaries and ethnic chains
 narnaund kasbe ke devraj dharmashala main yojit mahapanchayat main khap choudhariyon ne ek sur main elaan kiya ki ab satarol khap ke 42 gaanvon ke log apni santanon ke rishte kar sakenge
 With this, it was decided to break the ethnic chains that any young man and woman outside their caste can marry of their own free will
 shart keval yah rakhi gai he ki aise antarjaateey vivaah khud ke gaanv, gotra va padosi gaanv ko chhodkar hon
 After this, the Khap Panchayat will have no objection, but this Khap will strongly welcome interracial marriage
 mahapanchayat kii adhyakshata karne vaale satarol khap ke pradhan soobedaar indra singh ne kaha ki is faisle kaa makasad satarol khap ke bhaichaare ko todna nahin balki rishte-naaton ke bandhan ko kholana he
 In the Mahapanchayat, Wazir Man Rajthal said that looking at the time, the bond of relationship-relationship should be opened
 isse satarol khap kaa bhaichara khatm nahin hoga balki rishtedaari hone ke baad khap ko or zyada majbootee milegi
 Basauram Narnaund said that we are having a lot of trouble in getting into relationships because the scope of Satrol Khap is very big and it should be shortened according to the relationship so that he can make the relationship of his children within close range
 unhone kaha ki ladakiyon kii sankhya bahut kam ho gai he jisaki vajah se hamen apane bacchon ke rishte ke liye dur-daraaj bhatakana padataa he
 Now the time has come that this old tradition should be changed
 unhone kaha ki samay ke anusaar khap ne apane niyamon main pehle bhi badlaav kiye hai or ab bhi samay kii maang ko dekhte hue badalane chahie
 In the Mahapanchayat, a committee of five people was formed after the opinion of all the people, in which the decision was made to include Jilla Singh from Ugalan Tapa, Hoshiar Singh from Narnaund Tapa, Hansraj from Bas Tapa and Captain Mahabir Singh and Subedar Inder Singh of Satrol Khap
 
 is samiti ne faisla liya ki aaj se satarol khap ke log aapas main rishtedaari kar sakengen
 But this historic decision of Mahapanchayat was also opposed
 kareeb 650 saal puraani parpanra ko todane ke virodh main petwad tapa ke logon ne apane vichaar rakhe or kaha ki khap kaa matlab hi aapasi bhaichara hota he
 It cannot contain kinship
 jab aapas main rishtedaari hone lagegi to phir bhaichara kahaan bachataa he
 Strongly opposing it, the people leading the Tapa decided to boycott the Mahapanchayat and left the Mahapanchayat
 bhartiya rigerv bank (arabiai) ne sahaara india parivaar kii holding company sahaara india financial corporation limited (esafsiel) kaa license radd kar diya he
 Officials gave this information on Tuesday
 yah kadam arabiai ke gaiyr banking nigaraanee vibhaag ne kanpur main uthaaya
 The official said that this step has been taken due to several irregularities by Sahara and ignoring financial rules
 faisla sahaara india ke kapoorthala mukhyalay main bhej diya gaya he
 This decision of RBI can be considered as the last nail in the coffin, as investment from SIFCL was transferred to media, real estate and other companies of Sahara family
 ullekhneey he ki company ke pramukh subrat raay ek saal se adhik avadhi se jail main band hai or arabiai ke taaja faisle se mana ja rahaa he ki samooh kii ridh tut jaaegi
 After this decision, Sahara India will not be able to do any financial transaction
 arabiai ne 2008 main company ko chit fund ke tahat kisi jamakarta se jamaa sweekaar karne par roak laga di thi
 The comments tab se kai niveshkon ne arabiai ko shikaayat kii thi ki sahaara unka paisa waapas nahin kar rahi he
 After this, an order for its investigation was issued by the RBI
 jaanch kii rapat gat maheene arabiai ke mumbai mukhyalay ko bheja gaya tha
 It was then decided to cancel the license of SIFCL
 adhikari ne kaha ki sahaara dwaara kai aniyamitataayen or vittiya niyamon kii andekhi kiye jane kii vajah se yah kadam uthaaya gaya he
 The verdict has been sent to the Kapurthala headquarters of Sahara India
 arabiai kaa yah faisla taabut main aakhri keel mana ja saktaa he, kyonki esafsiel se hi nivesh juta kar media, real estate tathaa sahaara parivaar kii anya companiyon ko hastantarit kiya jaataa tha
 It is noteworthy that the company's head Subrata Roy has been in jail for more than a year and the latest RBI decision is believed to break the backbone of the group
 is faisle ke baad sahaara india kisi bhi tarah kaa vittiya len-dein nahin kar paaegi
 In 2008, the RBI banned the company from accepting deposits from a depositor under chit funds
 tippaniyan Since then many investors have complained to RBI that Sahara is not returning their money
 iske baad arabiai ne isaki jaanch kaa aadesh jari kiya tha
 The investigation report was sent to the Mumbai headquarters of RBI last month
 iske baad esafsiel kaa license radd karne kaa faisla kiya gaya
