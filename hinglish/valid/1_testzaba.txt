megadugal mahashay ke kathananusaar jis prakaar bhautik vigyaan kii apni hi sochane kii vidhiyaan or vishesh prakaar ke pradutt hai usee prakaar chetana ke vishay main chintan karne kii apni hi vidhiyaan or pradutt hai
 Therefore, the subject of consciousness can neither be thought of by the methods of physics nor can it be used in its work
 phir bhautik vigyaan swayan apni un antim ikaayiyon ke swaroop ke vishay main nishchit mat prakashit nahin kar paaya he jo us vigyaan ke aadhaar hai
 So far, improvisation has been made about matter, power, speed, etc
 abhi tak unke swaroop ke vishay main antim nirnay nahin hua he
 Therefore, it is not rational to expect a final decision about consciousness
 chetana ko achetan tatv ke dwaara samajhaana, arthath usamen kaary-kaaran sambandh jodna sarvatha avivekpurna he
 Psychologists who have tried to explain consciousness as the result of the actions of the root matter, ie those who have considered it to be the result of physical actions, pulsing of nerves, etc
, have eliminated the presence of consciousness
 unhone chetana kii upasthiti ko hi samaapt kar diya he
 This is the result of the contemplation of Pavlaf and Watson sir
 unke kathananusaar man athwa chetana ke vishay main manovigyaan main sochna hi vyarth he
 The subject of psychology should be the visible behavior of man
 chetana ke sharir main sambandh ke vishay main manovaigyanikon ke vibhinn mat hai
 According to some, consciousness is the result of the actions that occur in the large brain of man, that is, the pulsing of some pulse
 yah apane main swatantra koi tatv nahin he
 According to others, consciousness is a self-element and has a relationship with the body, that is, actions in consciousness affect the body
 kabhi-kabhi chetana kii kriyaaon se sharir prabhavit nahin hota or kabhi sharir kii kriyaaon se chetana prabhavit nahin hoti
 According to one belief, the body is just a tool for the functioning of consciousness, which it sometimes uses and never brings
 parantu yadi yantra bighad jaae, athwa tut jaae, to chetana apane kaamon ke liye aapng ho jaati he
 The above opinion has been considered the best in the state of current progress of science by some serious psychological thinkers
 chetana ke teen str maane gaye hai : chetan, avchetan or achetan
 At the conscious level, all the things through which we think, understand and work
 chetana main hi manushya kaa ahambhaav rahata he or yaheen vichaaron kaa sanghathan hota he
 In the subconscious level, there are things whose knowledge we do not know immediately, but can be remembered in time
 achetan str main ve baaten rahati hai jo ham bhul chuke hai or jo hamaare ytn karne par bhi hamen yaad nahin aatin or vishesh prakriya se jinhen yaad karaayaa jaataa he
 The sensations that once remain in consciousness, they sometimes go into the subconscious and unconscious mind
 ye anubhutiyaan sarvatha niskriy nahin hotin, varan maanav ko anjaane hi prabhavit karti rahati hai
 Consciousness develops through interaction with the social environment
 vaataavaran ke prabhaav se manushya naitikta, auchity or vyavahaarakushalata praapt karata he
 This is called development of consciousness
 vikaas kii charam seemaa main chetana nij swatantraaa kii anubhuti karti he
 She can influence and influence social things, but can also separate herself from this effect
 chetana ko is prakaar kii anubhuti ko shuddh chaitanya athwa pramaata, aatma aadi shabdon se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 It has been discussed by scholars like Charles Yung, Spengel, William Brown etc

 After victory in this war, Alexander sent Ambi to negotiate with the Purvas, offering conditions like subduing the whole kingdom of Porus to Sikandar, since Ambi and Porus were old enemies, he rejected all the terms and Ambi with great difficulty
 Saved his life and escaped from there
 haalanki iske baad, donon pratidwandviyon ko sikandar ne vyaktigat madhyasthata se mail milaap kara diya; or takshashila ko, jhelum par bede ke liye upkaran or sanybal ke yogadan ke kaaran, aambhi ko jhelum nadi or sindhu ke bich kaa puraa kshetra saunpa diya gaya; machaatas ke bete philip kii mrityu ke baad use or shakti mil gai; sikandar kii maut ke baad or 321 isa purv triparadisus main praanton ke vibhaajan baad ke bhi use apane adhikaar ko barkaraar rakhane kii anumati di gai

 The measurement of the ionizing potential of an X-ray is called the unveiling: haalanki padaarth par insheel vikiran kaa prabhaav utpann aavesh kii apeksha unamem jamaa urja kii maatra se bahut kareeb se sambandhit hota he
 The measure of this absorbed energy is called the absorbed quantity: samatuly maatra, maanav utak par vikiran ke jaivik prabhaav kii maap he
 As for X-rays, it is equal to the absorbed volume

 After X-rays flow over the plate, the excited electrons of the phosphor material remain "trapped" in the "color centers" of the crystal lattice until they are excited by a laser beam passing through the plate surface
 During laser excitation, the free light is collected by a photomultiplier tube and the resulting signal is converted into a digital image by computer technology, which gives the process its common name, computerized radiography
 PSP plates can be reused, and do not require any modification to existing X-ray equipment to use them

 Made on a budget of Rs 60,000, the film was released on 10 March 1935 and failed at the box office
 Like many other early Indian films, Joymati is also missing negative and entire prints

 He said that in reality all the things of the universe live in this four-dimensional period
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki kabhi-kabhi aisi paristhitiyaan ban jaati hai jab bhinn vastuon ko in sabhi-ayaamon kaa anubhav alag-alag prathit ho
 The relation of time and time comes so much in our daily behavior that it is natural to have some incomplete but strong beliefs about them since childhood
 kaviyon ne dik or kaal kii gambhir, vishaal tathaa sundar kalpanaaon kaa varnan kiya he
 In philosophy and western psychology, there has been a thought about them since ancient times
 kanad ke vaisheshik darshan main akaash, dik or kaal kii dharanaayen suspasht di gai hai or inke gunon kaa bhi varnan kiya gaya he
 There is definitely a relation between time and time in the knowledge gained from sensory experiences
 is gyaan kii yadi vaastaviktaa samajha jaae to dik or kaal vastaviktaa se alag nahin ho sakate
 Each philosophical sect has given its own conceptions of reality, problem and time, their interrelations, which do not have consensus
 ganit main bhi dik or kaal kaa apratyaksh reeti se sambandh aata he
 Therefore, the development of prestigious physics depended on these assumptions
 bhautikee ke kuch praayogic fal jab in dharanaon se visangat dikhaai dene lage, tab ye dharanaayen vichlit hone lageen evam aapekshitawaad ne dik or kaal kaa nayaa swaroop sthapit kiya, jo anek prayogon dwaara pramanit or falat: ab sarvasammat ho chukaa he
 This new form of problem and time is not only different but also very difficult to understand, because the use of specific mathematics is necessary in its rendering
 at: jahaan-jahaan dik tathaa kaal sambandh aata he uskaa spashtikaran pehle sthool drushti se, tatpashchaat sookshm drushti se or ant main bhautikee kii drushti se karnaa adhik saral hoga
 Different types of problems can be considered by the suffixes of problem properties from sensory experiences
 anubhavon ke buddhi par jo parinaam hote hai unka pruthakkaran karke dharanaayen banati hai
 In this way, the perception of problems caused by self-experience is called "self-problem" or "personal problem"
 indriyajanya anubhavon main anek anubhav samast vyaktiyon ke liye samaan hote hai or aise anubhav jis ghatana se milte hai, use "vastav' kaha jaataa he
 The perception of "reality" is formed from communities of real events
 indriyon se drushti, sparsh, dhwani, ras or gandh ke anubhav milte hai, kintu ye anubhav sarvada vishwaas ke yogya hote hai, aisa nahin he
 Optical illusions are well known
 sparsh ke bhi sambhram vyavhaar main nity prathit hote hai, jaise do daanton ke bich kii khoh jeebh ko jitani lagati he usase kam choti ungali ko lagati he
 Often this is the case with all kinds of sensory experiences
 at: in apurna anubhavon se vyaktigat dik kii jo dharna banati he vah bhramamoolak hi hoti he
 With the help of measuring instruments and other appropriate instruments, limited subsistence of the senses can be increased and thus many events can be confused
 prayogon main maapan karke dik kii jo dharna hoti he use "bhautik dik kaha jaataa he
 Measurement scales are used for measurement
 anubhavon main dik kaa sambandh chaar prakaar se aata he or in chaaron prakaaron par vichaar karke dik ke gunon kii vyaavhaarik kalpanaayen banati hai
 When the object is directed to the site of an object, a form of the problem is conceived and it is also believed that the existence of the problem is independent
 kisi vastu ke sthal kaa nirdesh anya vastu ke "saapeksh' karne par dik kii "saapeksh sthiti' main doosraa swaroop dikhi detaa he
 The third form of a problem resembles the "shape" of objects, from which the divisibility of the problem can also be imagined
 akaash kii ore dekhne se dik kii "vishalata' kaa chauthaa swaroop dikhaai detaa he
 It is from these four types of forms that practical assumptions are often made regarding problems and the qualities of problems are also informed
 ghatnaon se praapt indriyajanya anubhavon kaa vichar kiya jaae to unke do prakaar hote hai
 Difference of events leads to imagery of problems and their sequence of imagery leads to time
 is prakaar dik or kaal hamaari vichaardhaara main sandigdh rup se pravesh karte hai
 The same period as the problem is also personal and each person's census is free and arbitrary
 itnaa hi nahin, is swa-kaal kii gananaa main bhi parivartan hota he or vah vyakti ke swasthya, avasthaa ityadi sthitiyon par nirbhar karata he, jaise, kisi kaary main manushya magn ho to kaal teji se katataa he
 Therefore, personal or self-time is not trustworthy
 kisi prakritik ghatana se - din or raat se - jo kaal kaa maapan hoga vah vyaktigat nahin rahegaa or sab logon ke liye samaan hoga
 Hence, such a period is called public period
 din or raat kaal ke sthool vibhaag hai
 If their small portions are done, then they are more suitable for time-lapse in practice
 isliye prahar, ghatika, pal vipal athwa ghanta, minute, second ityadi vibhaag kiye gaye
 Generally, time is measured by clock
 dik kii bhanti kaal ke bhi chaar swaroop vyavhaar main dikhaai dete hai
 "when?" From an event or experience
 The question is present and is equated with the problematic "where"
 is kalpana se kaal kaa astitv swatantra samajha jaataa he
 The relative form of time is seen when describing another event relative to the time period
 do ghatnaon ke bich ke kaal se kaal kaa jo swaroop dikhaai detaa he vah dik ke aakaar se samaan he
 Similarly, with the adjectives of timeless, infinite etc
, the vastness of time is shown
 dik tathaa kaal ke chaaron swaroopon ko, yaa gunon ko kahie, milakar vichaar karne par inke vishay main hamaari jo dharanaayen banati hai unako "swa' yaa "vyaktigat' athwa "manovaigyanik' dik or kaal kaha jaataa he
 To give definitions to the concepts of problems and times, a means of measuring them is necessary
 dik ke maapan ke liye drudh padaarthon ke dand, aujaar tathaa yantra upyog main laae jate hai
 These instruments measure the properties of objects such as length, angle, area, volume, etc
 in maapnon ke samay bindu, rekha, samtal ityadi kii dharanaayen banati jaati hai
 When these assumptions are strengthened by many iterations, then the location of the point, line, plane, etc
 is fundamental and the material objects are removed from these assumptions
 ab in dharanaon kii or eucalidia jyamiti kii moulik dharanaon kii samanta spasht hogi
 The notion of a problem involving measurement of fixed objects, or the measurement of objects, is called geometric or euclideal problem
 yah spasht he ki dik kii is dharna se uske jo gun samajhe jate hai ve keval eucalidia jyamiti kii paribhaashaon, swayansiddh or kalpanaaon ke upar hi nirbhar hote hai
 Our practical perception of problems and this geometric notion, determined by measurement, are the form of our macro vision and micro vision respectively
 eucalidia jyamiti par nirdhaarit dik kii yah dharna yadhyapi swaabhaavik dikhaai detii hogi, tathaapi iskaa vishleshan karne kii aavashyata he
 In Euclidean geometry some definitions and some axiomatic facts are given and they have been developed logically
 ye dharanaayen keval kaalpanik or swatantra hai
 With a little consideration it will be clear that Euclidean geometry has no real relation to objects of behavior
 apni mul kalpanaaon ko viksit karte samay unka paraspar tarksangat sambandh rakhana or ek "kaalpanik' ganit shaastra kaa nirmaan karnaa, itnaa hi is jyamiti kaa mul uddeshy tha
 This geometry was extremely successful in this purpose
 is jyamiti kaa or bhi vistaar karke use "vyaavhaarik' banane ke liye "adarsh drudh vastu' kii paribhaasha yah he ki iske do binduon kaa antar kisi bhi paristhiti main utana hi rahata he
 The use of measuring pen or other tools depends on this feature
 vastut: is prakaar "adarsh drudh vastu' ko samavisht karne par eucalidia jyamiti kaa swaroop badal jaataa he or usko ab ham bhautikee kaa ek vibhaag samaj sakate hai
 But in practice this change of Euclidean geometry is not seen from this point of view
 maapan karne par vyaavhaarik vastuon ke maapan ke liye eucalidia jyamiti ke siddhant yatharth dikhaai dete hai
 So Euclidean geometry came to be considered "real"
 vyaavhaarik anubhav or eucalidia jyamiti kaa drushti se newton ne apni dik or kaal kii dharanaayen nishchit rup se prastut kii or pratishthit bhautikee kaa vikaas praaia: vartmaan shatabdi ke prarambh tak inhen dharanaon par nirbhar rahaa
 Newton considered the problem to be independent power and also gave it its merits
 newton ke anusaar dik ke gun sarv dishaao main tathaa sarv binduon par samaan hi hote hai, arthath dik samadik, samang tathaa ek samaan he
 Therefore, the properties of substances are the same at all places in the problem
 dik anant he or newton ke dik main lambaai, kaal tathaa gati se abaadhit rahati he
 Newton has given his belief about the period, and this notion was also according to the development of physics of that time
 newton ke anusaar kaal bhi ek swatantra satta he
 The special quality of Kaal is that it "flows" continuously and everywhere at the same speed and no situation has any consequence on it
 kaal bhi anant he
 In summary, according to Newton both pain and time are independent and absolute entities
 newton aadi kii yantriki inhen dharanaon par nirbhar thi
 In mechanics, both speed and acceleration, both of these had to be fixed in time and time, and at that time there were no errors in these assumptions
 vaise hi bhautikee main newton kaa itnaa prabhaav tha ki in dharanaon par shankaa pradarshit karnaa sambhav nahin tha
 Mathematicians such as Bolaiye, Lobatchevsky, Reiman, etc
, proved that euclidean geometries can be formed if some transformations of Euclidean geometry are appropriate
 yadhyapi aeuclidia jyamitiyon ke anek siddhant eucalidia jyamiti ke siddhanton se bhinn hote hai, tathaapi ve ayogy nahin hote hai
 In particular Reiman's Euclidean Geometry made it clear that Euclidean Geometry is not the only fundamental one
 yadhyapi aeuclidia jyamitiyaan kalpana karne main kathin hoti hai, tathaapi tarksmmat hone se unke fal atyant rochak tathaa upyukt hote hai
 The imagery of the curvature of the problem was particularly suitable for the imagery of problems of more than three anomalies

 As he grew older, his meditation time also increased

 He used to stay meditative there too

 a year later, he established an ashram in Bajidpur to help the poor, the hungry, the helpless and the victims

 His second ashram was built in Madaripur

 Now his name became Swami Pranavanand
 uske baad unhone gaya, puri, kaashi, prayag aadi sthanon par sangh ke ashramon kii sthapana kii
 Since then, the 'bharat Sevashram Sangh' has been engaged in service activities during the time of calamity
 unhone samajaseva, tirthasanskaar, dharmik or naitik adarsh kaa prachaar, guru puja ke prati jaagrukta jaise anek kaary kiye
 Swami Pranavanandji did not recognize caste discrimination
 unhone apane ashramon main ‘hindu milan mandir’ banaaye jinamein jatigat bhed ko chhodkar sab hindu prarthana karte the
 Everybody was taught the scriptures
 iske baad unhone ‘hindu raksha dal’ gathit kiya
 Its purpose was also to rise above caste sentiment and organize Hindu youth by teaching them exercise and weapon operation
 vartmaan samay main bharat sevashram sangh ke desh-videsh main 75 ashram karyrat hai
 On 8 January 1941, he gave up his body after completing his life-work

 Now their followers are running the Sangh on their stated ideals
