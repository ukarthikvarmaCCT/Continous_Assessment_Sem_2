 Over a period of 10 years from 2008, Burger King predicted that 80 percent of its market share would be driven by overseas expansion, particularly in the Asia Pacific and Indian subcontinent regional markets
 While the TPG leadership group maintained bk's international expansion by announcing plans to open new franchise locations in Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East and Brazil, the company focused on the three largest markets - India, China and Japan Is planning company 2012 ke ant tak in asian kshetron ke saath-saath anya deshon jaise macau main 250 se zyada store kholane kii yojana bana rahi he

 There have been different laws of land tenure in different periods

 After independence, laws related to land reform have been made in almost all the states
 inkaa lakshya yah rahaa he ki bhoomi par kheti karanevaalon or rajya ke bich se madhyavartiyon ko samaapt kar diya jaae
 Even during the British rule, many changes were made in the land system
 is sambandh main lard cornwalis dwaara sthapit sthaayee bhoomi vyavastha kaa ullekh aavashyak he
 Lord Cornwallis tried to establish an England-like land system in India
 is vyavastha ke falswaroop bengal ke jameendaar sarkaar ko sthaayee rup se malgujari dete the
 In 1900, the zamindars of Bengal used to give four crores of rupees to the government while they used to collect Rs 1611 crores as rent from the farmers who cultivate the land
 kisaanon kii raksha karne ke liye san 1886 or 1928 main kanoon banaae gaye jinke aadhaar par kisaanon ko dedkhal kiye jane se roka gaya
 In 1938, the Cloud Commission was appointed there
 usne bengal kii bhoomivyavastha main amul parivartan karne kaa suzav diya
 The permanent land system of Bengal was abolished in 1945 and the intermediaries between the cultivators and the government there were abolished
 madras main british shasankaal main raiyatwari or jameendaari vyavastha thi
 Under the Ryotwadi system, the farmer was the permanent owner of his farm
 paitruk sanmatti ke rup main bhoomi uske uttaradhikariyon ko mil jaati thi
 He also had the authority to sell or transfer his land
 raiyat ko keval sarkaar ko malgujari deni padati thi
 Gradually the said ryots became zamindars and all the evils that were found in the zamindari system also arose in the land system of Madras
 madras ke bahut bade bhaag par jameendaari vyavastha kii bhudhruti thi
 In the fifth part of Madras in 1802, landlords were given land under permanent land system
 jameendaaron ko apni bhoomi ke liye sarkaar ko 'peshkast' dena padataa tha
 In 1946, the Congress Cabinet of Madras decided the abolition of Zamindari and in 1950, there also became a law for the abolition of Zamindari

 The old Madhya Pradesh land economy was of two types
 pratham, kuch kshetra main raiyatwari vyavastha thi or dwitiya, kuch kshetra main malgujari kii vasuuli vasuul karne par 25 pratishat kamishan miltaa tha
 The ryots had inheritance rights over their land but did not have the right to transfer the land
 lagaan na dene par, gaiyrkanoonee dhang se jameen hastantarit karne par, kheti na kar sakane par or bhoomivyavastha kaa ulanghan karne par raiyat ko bhoomi se bedakhal kiya ja saktaa tha
 Small-paid tenants did not get any kind of legal protection
 dhire dhire raiyatwari kshetra kaa patel apane kshetra kaa jameendaar sa ban baitha
 In 1951, a law was made in Madhya Pradesh by which such zamindari was abolished
 san 1953 main gram panchayat kanoon banaaya gaya jiske dwaara vahaan kii bhoomivyavastha main sudhaar kiya gaya

 aisi bhumi ko 'khaas mahal' kaha jaataa tha
 Apart from the big landowners, there were two types of tenants - one, the farmers whose rent was fixed permanently and the other, who for some time had possession of the land

 Historically, the English language has its origins in several dialects, now called Old English, introduced by the anglo-saxon people who settled in England since the early 5th century

 vahaan se aadhunik angreji kaa vikaas hua or abhi bhi isamen anek bhashaaon se videshi shabdon ko apnaane or saath hi saath nae shabdon ko gadhane kii prakriya nirantar jari he
 The formation of a large number of English words, especially technical words, is based on the roots of ancient Greek and Latin
 aadhunik angreji, jisko kabhi - kabhi pratham vaishvik saamaanya bhashaa ke taur par bhi varnit kiya jaataa he,sanchaar, vigyaan, vyapaar, vimaanan, manoranjan, radio or kootneeti ke kshetron kii pramukh antarrashtriya bhashaa he
 Its expansion beyond the British Isles began with the development of the British Empire and by the end of the 19th century its reach had become truly global

 Since the Second World War, the recognition of America as a global superpower and its increasing economic and cultural influence has brought significant momentum in the spread of the English language

 According to linguists such as David Crystal, an effect of the widespread spread of English, as has happened with other global languages, appears to reduce the diversity of vernacular languages in many parts of the world, particularly The effect is seen in Australasia and North America, and its enormous impact continues to play an important role in language attrition
 isi prakaar aitihaasi bhashavid, jo kii bhashaa parivartan kii jatilta or gatishiltaa se avgat hai, angreji bhashaa dwaara alag bhashaaon ke ek nae parivaar kaa nirmaan karne kii isaki aseem sambhaavnaaon ke prati hameshaa avgat rahete hai
 According to these linguists, the reason for this is the huge size of the English language and the spread of communities using it and its natural internal diversity, such as its creoles and pizzins 
o english ek west jarmenic bhashaa he jisaki utpatti anglo-fritian or loar sexn boliyon se hui he
 These dialects were brought to Britain in the 5th century by German nomads and Roman auxiliary armies from various parts of present-day northwestern Germany and northern Netherlands

 Initially Old English was a group of diverse dialects that reflected the diversity of the anglo-saxon states of Great Britain

 doosraa 11 veen sadi ke normans the, jo kii puraani norman bhashaa bolte the or isaki anglo-norman namak ek angreji kism kaa vikaas kiya
 The English became somewhat "mixed" due to these two attacks
 scandinaviens ke saath sahanivaas ke parinamswaroop angreji bhashaa ke anglo-frisian kor kaa shabdic anupuran hua; baad ke norman kabje ke parinamswaroop bhashaa ke germanik kor kaa sundarikaran hua, isamen romance bhashaaon se kai sundar shabdon ko samavisht kiya gaya
 This Norman influence entered English mainly through the courts and the government
 is prakaar, angreji ek "udhaar" kii bhashaa ke rup main viksit hui jisamen lacheelaapan or ek vishaal shabdaawalee thi
 The rise and expansion of the British Empire as well as the emergence of the United States as a great power resulted in the spread of English throughout the world

 Attacks of Vikings and Norse tribes from the north also began in the eighth and ninth centuries, and thus the region of present-day England became a country of many language speakers and many old words found new meanings
 jaise – dream kaa arth us samay tak anand lenaa tha lekin uttar ke vikings ne ise sapane kaa arth de diya
 Similarly, the word skirt also came here with the northern attackers
 lekin iskaa rup badal kar shart ho gaya
 Later both the words started to be used in different meanings and are happening till date

 angreji bhashaa indo-europea bhashaa parivaar ke germanik shakha ke pashchimi up-shakha kii sadsy he
 The only surviving relatives of English have two names, either Scots, spoken mainly in Scotland or parts of Northern Ireland, or Frisian
 Since Scots linguists see either a separate language or a group of dialects of English, Frisian is often said to be the closest relative of English than Scots
 inke baad anya jarmenic bhashaaon kaa number aata he jinka naata thodaa dur kaa he, ve hai, pashchimi europea bhashaayen or uttari jarmenic bhashaayen or farois
 scots or sambhawatah frisian ke apwaad ke sivaa inamen se kisi bhi bhashaa kaa angreji ke saath parsparik mail nahin baithta he
 The reason for this is the difference in word storage, syntax, semantics and phonetic knowledge
 anya jarmenic bhashaaon ke saath angreji ke shabd bhandaran main antar kaa mukhya kaaran angreji main badi maatra main latin shabdon kaa upyog he or french ) german or angreji kaa vaakyavinyas bhi angreji se kaaphi alag he, vaakyon ko banane ke liye alag niyam hai 
 shabdaarth vigyaan angreji or uske sambandhiyon ke bich juthi dostiyon kaa kaaran he
 Differences in phonics also blur basically related words, and sometimes both phonetics and semantics are different
 1500 sau se zyada varshon se angreji main yogic shabdon ke nirmaan or maujuuda shabdon main sudhaar kii kriya apane alag andaaj main, germanik bhashaaon se pruthak, chal rahi he
 For example, abstract nouns can be formed by adding suffixes like -hood, -ship, -dom, -ness to native words in English
 lagbhag sabhi jarmenic bhashaaon main in sabhi ke sajaateey pratyay maujuud hai lekin unke upyog bhinn ho gaye hai, jaise kii german "free-hit" banaam angreji "free-dam" An English speaker can also read many French words easily because there is a large amount of adjustment of French and Norman words in English
 yah samaayojan norman vijay ke baad anglo-norman bhashaa se or baad kii sadiyon main sidhe french bhashaa se shabdon ko uthaane ke kaaran he
 As a result, a large part of the English vocabulary comes from the French language, with some minor spelling differences and differences in the meanings of so-called false friends
 The English pronunciation of most French single words is fully Englishized and follows a specific English method of emphasis

 Apart from these two major dialects, there are several varieties of English, most of which include several sub-types, such as Cockney, Scouse and Geordie under British English; Newfoundland English under Canadian English; And African American Local English and South American English under American English
 English is a multi-centric language and does not have a central language authority like the 'acedimia francai' of France; Therefore, no one type is considered "right" or "wrong"

 paaramparik prakaaron ke uccharan, vyakaran or shabd bhandar angreji kii anya kismon se bhinn, kabhi kabhaar baari maatra main, hai
 Due to the widespread use of English as a second language, there are different types of accents of its speakers, which reveal the local dialect or language of the speaker

 udahaaran ke taur par, aashcharya athwa vyangy vyakt karnaa, yaa ek vaktavy ko prashn main badalanaa
 In English, intonation patterns occur on a group of words known as tone groups, tone units, intonation groups, or sense groups
 tone samoohon ko ek hi saans main kaha jaataa he, is kaaran se inaki lambaai simit rahati he
 These are on average five words long and are finished in about two seconds
 udhaaharan ke liye : English is a very spoken language
 shabdon or vaakyon, donon ke kuch shabdaanshon ko uccharan ke samay apekshaakrit adhik mahatva / jor miltaa he jabaki anya ko nahin
 pehle prakaar ke shabdaanshon ko axcentuated / stressd kaha jaataa he or baad waalon ko anexentuated / anstroped 
 Thus each tone group in a sentence can be divided into syllables which will be either stressed or unstressed
 The stressed syllable is called the nuclear syllable
 udhaaharan ke liye: Was the best thing you could have done! ' yahaan saare shabdaansh anstroped hai, sivaay best or dan ke, jo kii stressd hai
 The emphasis on BEST is slightly higher, hence the nuclear syllable

 haan / nahin vaale prashnon kii chadhati hui aawaaj ke peeche bhi yahi he
 for example: swar prayek kshetra main bhinn bhinn hote hai
 Where symbols are visual in pairs, the first corresponds to the common American pronunciation of American English, the second corresponds to the received pronunciation of British English

 For example, modern English, unlike modern German or Dutch and romance languages, lacks gender grammar and adjective agreement
 cese marking bhashaa se lagbhag gaayab ho chuki he or aaj iskaa istemaal mukhya rup se sarvnaam main hi kiya jaataa he
 The form of strong versus weak verbs derived from Germanic origin has gained importance in modern English and the use of curved remains has increased

 lambe latin shabdon ko aksar zyada alankrita or shikshit mana jaataa he
 However, excessive use of Latin words is considered to be an attempt to show off or hide the issue

 Most Latin words are commonly used in formal speech or writing, such as a court or an encyclopedic article
 However, there are other Latin words that are commonly used in general colloquial and do not appear to be too formal; These words are primarily for concepts that no Germanic word has survived

 The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition contains more than 6 million definitions, following the overall policy: It embraces not only the standard language of literature and conversation, whether current at the moment, or obsolete, or archaic, but also the main technical vocabulary, and a large measure of dialectal usage and slang 
 The editors of Webster's third new international dictionary, without layoffs, estimate this number to be much higher in his preface
 aisa anumaan he kii lagbhag 25,000 shabd har saal bhashaa main judate hai
 One consequence of the French influence is that the English vocabulary has been somewhat divided into Germanic and Latin words
 angreji ke 1000 sabase aam shabdon main se 83% or 100 sabase aam main se puure 100 jarmenic hai

 The result of this complex orthographic history is that reading can be a challenging task
 greek, french or spanish or kai anya bhashaaon kii tulana main, ek chaatr ko angreji pathan kaa paarangat banane main zyada vakt lagata he
 Only consonant letters are pronounced in a relatively regular way: adhikansh jarmenic bhashaaon ke vipareet, angreji main dyacritics, sivaay videshi udharshabdon ke, lagbhag nahin ke baraabar hai or do swaron ke uccharan ko ek dhwani kii bajaay pruthak darshane ke liye diarisis nishaan ke asaamaanya upyog main

 The scope of this variation is limited to the spelling differences of British and American English
 angreji pathan ko asana karne ke liye iske kuch sarlikrut sanskaran bhi maujuud hai
 One of these is Basic English, formed by Charles K
 Ogden with limited words and describes it in his book Basic English: a General Introduction with Rules and Grammar
 yah bhashaa angreji ke ek sarlikrut sanskaran par aadhaarit he
 Ogden said that it would take seven years to learn English, seven months for Esperanto and only seven days for basic English
 Companies that require complex books for international use, as well as schools that teach people basic English in a short period of time, can use Basic English

 But as a mother tongue, Hindi and Chinese language has surpassed English
 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200~350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 Azolla is a floating fern that resembles algae

 It grows rapidly

 The specialty of Azola is that it doubles in 5 days in a favorable environment
 yadi ise puure varsh badhane diya jaye to 300 ton se bhi adhik sendriya padaarth prati hectare paidaa kiya ja saktaa he yani 40 ki0gra0 natrajan prati hectare praapt
 Azolla contains 3
5 percent nitrogen and a variety of organic materials that increase the energetic strength of the soil
 dhan ke kheton main iskaa upyog sugamawa se kiya ja saktaa he
 In a field filled with 2 to 4 inches of water, 10 tons of fresh azolla is put before planting
 iske saath hi iske upar 30 se 40 ki0gra0 super phosphate kaa chhidkaav bhi kar diya jaataa he
 The temperature of 30 to 35 degree Celsius is very favorable for its growth

 The color of this fern is dark red or brown

 ajola culture daalane ke baad duusare din se hi ek trey yaa pokhar main ajola kii moti tah jamana shuru ho jaati he jo natrajan sthirikaran kaa kaary karti he Paleontology or paleontology or palaeontology is a branch of geology that deals with the remains of animals and plants of the geological ages which are now found only in the rocks of the earth's crust
 jeevashmiki kii paribhaasha dete hue tweb hofel or aak ne likhaa he : jeevashmiki vah vigyaan he, jo aadim paudhen tathaa jantuon ke ashmibhoot avasheshon dwaara prakat bhootkaaleen bhugarbhik yugon ke jeevanaki vyakhya karata he
 Thus it is clear that paleontology studies primitive animals on the basis of their volatile remains
 jeevashm shabd se hi yah ingit hota he ki jeev + ashm kaa adhyayan he
 The term Palaentology in English also refers to the study of Palaios = Ancient + Onto = Fauna
 jeevashm vigyaan kaa adhyayan jeevigyaan kii nai shakha he or iskaa vikaas gat 200 varshon se hi adhik hua he
 Long before the development of this branch of science, it was in the knowledge of the primitive human beings that in some types of rocks, a strange type of remains are found which correspond to marine organisms
 gyaan ke abhaav main usne pehle-pahal in avasheshon ko jaivik utpatti kaa na samajhakar, prakruti ke vinod kii saamagree samaj rakhaa tha, jo prithvi ke andar kisi shakti ke kaaran ban gaye
 But, with the increase of knowledge, man had to change his thoughts in this direction too and he discovered that the remains of the remains found in the rocks were living creatures at some time and the place where Today we find these fossils was in the womb of the sea in geological ages
 san 1820 tak keval 127 ashmibhoot vanaspatiyon tathaa 2,100 jantuon kaa hi pataa chalaa tha, jo 1840 tak badhkar kramash: 2,050 tathaa 24,300 kii sankhya tak pahunch gaya
 Since then, these numbers have increased unprecedentedly
 maanav kshamta ke adheen yah sambhav nahin he ki sansar ke jine bhi jeevashmon ke strot hai, un sabaki khojbin kar lee jaae
 Secondly, life on Earth has been originating since billions of years ago
 tisare, sansar kii bhugolic akruti jaisi aaj drushtigochar hoti he, waisi un dinon nahin thi
 Animals used to move from one place to another
 at: hamen unke ashmibhoot namoonon se jo gyaan praapt hota yaa ho saktaa he, vah vicchhinn hi he, yaa hoga
 In the end, it is never possible that all the creatures who were present in that dark age of history, all of them have already been pornized
 ashmikaran kii kuch dashaayen hoti hai, jinke kaaran jeevajantu ke mrit shariron kaa ashmikaran ho jaataa he
 The vulgarization of all creatures is neither necessary nor possible
 is kaaran bhi aadi jeevon ke jivan kaa shrunkhalabaddh itihaas likhnaa duruh kaary he
 On the basis of all the fossil evidence we have received so far, there is a lot of light on the evolution of organisms
 jeevashmon ke adhyayan se hamen un jeevon kaa pataa chalata he jo ab yaa to lupt ho gaye hai, yaa unka vartmaan swaroop paryaapt parivartit ho gaya he
 Fossils are remnants of ancient creatures, which have become stone like stones in stones or other places
 jeevon ke kuch aise bhi avshesh praapt hue hai, jo prastirbhoot na hokar apane mul rup main hi hai
 Dead bodies of mammoths and other animals found in the icebergs are safe in museums in Russia and England and America
 jeevashm bhi, aadhunik jeevon kii akruti se, newnaadhik rup main, milte-julate hai
 Fossils are found only in sedimentary rocks
 anek prakaar ke jeevajantuon kii anek paristhitiyon main mrityu ke uparaant unke shavon par jo avsaad jamaa haate hate hai, kalantar main ve hi jeevashm ban jaaya karte hai
 Some fossils are so complete that even after their molecular examination, even the cell compositions of organisms are visible
 jeevon ke ashmibhoot pramaan apane jivit sharir ke rup main hi mil jaaen, yah aavashyak nahin he
 In their bodies, disorder arises due to decay, oxidation, deforming by predatory organisms, cold, rain, sunlight etc
 kuch jantu, jinke sharir calcium carbonate, silica aadi jaise acarbonic padaarthon dwaara bane hote hai, unpar vikaar kaa prabhaav apekshaakrit kam padataa he
 Fossils of such organisms are available in very small numbers
 jo uplabdh hai bhi ve aadhunik jivit jeevon se tulana karne ke liye apurna hai
 Another feature of organisms is that fossils of one type are found only in certain types of rocks

 Primitive surroundings - For the life of animals, whether they are vegetation, animals, special types of geographical environment are suitable

 Paleontology is divided into several branches
 suvidha kii drushti se ab yah niyam sa ban gaya he ki jab ham 'jeevashmiki' shabd kaa upyog karte hai tab hamaara abhipraay keval aksheruki jeevon ke jeevashmon ke adhyayan se hota he
 The branch of paleontology under which vertebrate fossils are studied is called vertebrate paleontology
 padap jeevashmon kaa adhyayan ek bhinn shakha ke antargat kiya jaataa he jise padpashm vigyaan kehete hai
 In modern times, some other major branches of paleontology have also developed, whose fields of study are very small organisms and fossil humans respectively
 jeevashmiki kaa kshetra bada vyapak he or uski seemaa nishchit rup se nirdhaarit nahin kii ja sakati
 If viewed theoretically, the emergence of fossilism begins with the evolution of an organism on Earth, but on geological grounds it can only be said that half of the history of the entire organism on Earth, or even less, We find the records of creatures
 jeevashm vaigyanik anveshanon kaa prarambhkaal aise pracheenatam prapya jeevashmon se kiya ja saktaa he jinke jaivik gun jaivikeey aadhaar par batalaaye ja sakate hai
 Paleontology has a very close relationship with geology, especially layered-rock-geology
 ateet kaal ke jeevon ke avshesh starit shailon main paae jate hai
 The fossils found in them have been very helpful in the construction of these rocks and in establishing their sequence
 vastav main bina jeevashmon ke starit-shail-bhoumiki, ek prakaar se, vyaavhaarik jeevashmiki he
 Paleontology has a close relationship with biology
 jaiviki ke antargat vartmaan jivit praaniyon or padpon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he, jab ki jeevashmiki main bhoumikeey yugon ke un jeevon or padpon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he jo kabhi jivit the or ab jeevashm ke rup main hi prapya hai
 But paleontology cannot be considered a branch of biology, as the material of the study of paleontology and the manner of its collection are completely different from the material of the study of biology and the manner of its collection
 yah nishchit karnaa ki kis sthaan par jeevashmiki ko jaiviki se pruthak kiya ja saktaa he, praaia: asambhav sa he
 But roughly the end of fossils and the beginning of biology can be traced back to the Sandhisthana of the ultra-new age and modern era
 is prakaar se anishchit or sandigdh cambrian-purv mahakalp praani evam padapjaat tathaa vartmaan kaal ke nishchit tathaa anek prakaar ke jeevon or padpon ke bich main anek tathaa vibhinn prakaar ke jeev avshesh milte hai, jo jeev par prakaash daalate hai
 These fossils found in the sedimentary rocks of Bhuparpti are the basis of the study of paleontology
 jeevigyaani jeevashmiki main isliye atyadhik abhiruchi rakhte hai ki iskaa jeevvikas jaise vishay se nikat sambandh he
 The history or species of species of animals and plants can be traced more confidently based on the study of fossils derived from the sequenced levels of layered rocks
 parantu jeevon ke apurna abhilekh ke kaaran unke jativrutt ke anurekhan main atyadhik baadha padati he, kyonki bhoumikeey yugon main paae janevaale praaniyon or padpon main se kuch hi or unamem se adhikansh apurna dasha main, in shailon main parilakshith paae jate hai
 In spite of this incompleteness of the inscription, in many organisms, when they are traced from one level to the other, the changes take place
 jab jeevashmon ke praturup vibhinn anukramit staron se ekatrit kiye jate hai, tab pratyaksh rup se do bhinn dikhaai padanevaali jatiyaan bich ke jeevashmon dwaara sambandhit dikhaai padati hai or nimnatam str main pai janevaali jati se lekar ucchtam str main milanevaali jati tak ke bichwaale staron ke jeevashmon ke jeevon main hue parivartanon ko dekha ja saktaa he
 In addition to the standard method, comparative methods of body and personality can also be used to detect caste from fossils
 at: jeevashmiki is dharna kii pushti karata he ki jeevvikas shanai: shanai: tathaa kramash: honevaale parivartanon ke parinamswaroop hua
 There is also evidence to suggest that the evolution of organism was evolutionary
 kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki kuch jeevon ke varg main jeevvikasiya parivartan yug ugantar tak kisi nishchit disha main hue or iske atirikt aise sambhddha varg jo ek hi paitruk utpatti ke hai, ek duusare se tathaa bahya dashaon se bina prabhavit hue, apane vikaas main samaan avasthaaon athwa usase milti julati avasthaaon main se gujarey, jisase yah prakat ho jaataa he ki jeevon ke vibhinn virgon main vikaas kii disha, sarsaadhaaran purvaj se paitruk gunon dwaara nishchit ho jaati he
 Tracing the complete stages of development from the unicellular egg of the living plants and animals to the final stage, is subject to geology and organism
 kisi varg ke padpon or praaniyon kii jatiyon kaa vikaas, kam se kam apni praarambhik avasthaaon main lagbhag samaan hota he or ek varg ke antargat aanevaale sampurna bhrunon main, kisi ek avasthaa tak ek duusare main itani sadrishyata hoti he ve pruthak nahin kiye ja sakate
 This fact has revealed excessive fraternity in shapes that are highly different from one another in adulthood
 is baat kii vaastaviktaa kasherukiyon main dekhne ko milti he, jinke bhrun praarambhik avasthaaon main ati kathinaayee ke saath ek duusare se alag kiye ja sakate hai or jo bahut dhire dhire apane varg athwa gana kii lakshanik akritiyon ko dhaaran kar lete hai
 The results of these embryological explorations have a special relationship with paleontology
 aise anek jeevashm jaankaree main hai jo apane main apane se sambandhit aadhunik jeevon kii tulana main bhruneey, athwa kam se kam dimbhiy, athwa kishoravasa ke lakshan dikhaate hai
 Examples of this type of primitive embryonic types are found especially in vertebrates, as skeletons become obscured during the very early period of life
 at: aadhunik jeevon kii apraudh avasthaaon kii tulana sidhe praudh jeevashm se kii ja sakati he
 Giving definite names to fossils is important to the paleontologist so that he can distinguish more accurately among fossils
 jeevashmon kaa namakaran saamanyat: unheen siddhanton par aadhaarit he jinpar praaniyon kaa
 Pranijagat is divided into many sanghas and each sangha is divided into several classes, gana, clans, clans and castes
 jeevashmon ke kai prakaar ke praroop hote hai
 If the investigator describes an entire caste on the basis of a model of a fossil of that caste, then that fossil model is called the name of that caste
 yadi kisi ek ke namprarup kaa nishchay karne main anveshak anya jeevashm namoonon kii sahaayta letaa he, to in atirikt namoonon ko paratip kehete hai
 If the investigator takes the help of many other fossil specimens without deciding the name, then these fossil specimens are called Sahuparup
 yadi kisi jati ke jeevashm kaa sahpraroop us jati ke praarambhik varnan ke pashchaat kii us jati kaa praaroop chun jaataa he, to vah jeevashm praroop lactotip kehalaata he
 Just as there are fossil specimens to describe a caste, similarly there are caste or homogeneous fossils to describe a lineage
 yadi koi anveshak kisi ek nae vansh kaa varnan kisi ek vishesh jati ke aadhaar par karata he, to vah jati us vansh ke liye jenoholotip ho jaati he
 If the investigator gives a list of such castes in the description of the new dynasty that he considers to be under the new lineage, then all these species are called genocyntypes
 bahut se jenocentipon main se baad main aadi anveshak dwaara athwa baad main kisi anya anveshak dwaara ek jenolectotip chhaanta ja saktaa he
 The geological period is divided into five major parts
 ye kramash: nimnlikhit hai- Archaeozoic Mahakalp is the oldest among them
 bhoumikeey kaal ke in paanch mahakalpon main vibhaajan mukhyat: in mahakalpon main milanevaale praaniyon or padpon ke jeevashmon par hi aadhaarit he
 Of these, the Archeozoic Great Canyon was fauna
 is mahakalp main na kisi prakaar ke jeevajantu or na paudhe hi the
 Therefore, we do not find any fossils in the rocks of this period
 pragjeev mahakalp main protozoa jaise ati saadhaaran prakaar ke jeevajantu astitv main aae
 But due to the lack of any tough part in these ordinary organisms, they could not be preserved in the rocks
 at: pragjeev mahakalp ke shailon main bhi jeevashm nahin milte
 The other three Mahakalpas, namely, the Puranjeevi Mahakalpa, the Madhyamajeeva Mahakalpa and the Nutanjeevi Mahakalpa are fossiliferous
 in mahakalpon ke antargat aanevaale jitne bhi chote se lekar bade tak vibhaajan hai ve sab purnat: us kaal main paae janevaale jeevon ke jeevashm par hi aadhaarit hai
 Therefore, we see that the work of layered paleontologists cannot run without the help of paleontology
 yahi kaaran he ki jeevashm vigyaan starit shailavigyaan kaa merudand kehalaata he
 On the basis of paleontology broadly, the following four main animal and plant ethnic superpowers can be established: purv purajivi mahakalp - iske antargat cambrian, ordovishan or silyurian kalp aate hai
 Answer: The archaeological Mahakalpa - Dioni, Carboni and Permian Kalpa are covered under it
 madhyajivi mahakalp Nutanjeev Mahakalpa - Abhinav Kaal is also under it
 praaia: sab pramukh aksheruki praaniyon ke pratinidhi jeevashm cambrin staron main paae jate hai or unamem se trilobite jaise kuch praani adicrambrian kaal main hi apekshaya adhik viksit ho chuke the
 Hence the assumption that the ancestors of all classes found in the Cambrian strata were found in the pre-cambrian period, although their remains are not found in the Cambrian pre-shales
 yah kalpana kii ja sakati he ki cambrionpurv samudron main sab prakaar ke praani rahete the, parantu ve sab komalangi purvaj the, jinhone apane astitv ke vishay main kisi bhi prakaar ke chihr nahin chhoden hai
 Since all types of animals are directly or indirectly dependent on plants, and plants only have the power to process inorganic foods, it also seems reasonable to assume that plants existed in the pre-cambrian period
 parantu yah aashcharya kii baat he ki paudhon ke avshesh purajivi mahakalp ke staron main nahin paae gaye hai
 Following is a brief description of the main characteristics of the zoological world of the predecessor Mahakalpa: yah matsay or parnang samaan sthal padpon kaa, jinhen terridosperms kehete hai, yug tha
 Along with these were found goniotites, spiriferid bahupad and rugos coral
 madhyajivi mahakalp sarisrupon or amonites kaa kalp kehalaata he
 Along with them, rinconilids and corals were also prominent in the Belemnites Brachiopoda
 yah kalp staniyon, pakshiyon, foraminipheron or aavrutabiji padpon kaa kaal tha
 On the basis of animals and plants, we cannot separate the new life cycle from modern times
 sampurna shailon ke anukram kaa kram bhalee bhanti nishchay ho jane or unamem paae janevaale jeevashmon kii pahchaan ho jane ke uparaant yah pataa chalaa ki jeevon ke vikaas main shanai:-shanai: pragati hui
 The most common types of organisms first appeared, which are found in the oldest sedimentary rocks, and after that the complex organisms gradually came to the Tarunatar rocks
 is prakaar sampurna aksheruki sanghon ke pratinidhi, jo jeevashm rup main parirakshan yogya hai, cambrian shailon main milte hai, parantu prayek sangh ke antargat paae janevaale jeev apni rachana main praaia: samaan the or bahut kam parivartan dikhaate the
 On morphological basis, we may call them underdeveloped lineages, but in later ages the composition of organisms found in each association was more varied and this fact is confirmed to some extent by the increase in the number of lineages
 kasherukiyon main rachana ke aadhaar par aadim varg samajha janevaala cychlosotomata varg he, jiskaa sabase pehle pradurbhaav hua or jiske uparaant kramash: matsay, ubhaychar, sarisrup, pakshi or stani aae or ye varg usee kram se prakat hote gaye jaisaa unki rachana se aashaa kii jaati thi
 Thus, the order of acquisition of organisms in the geological ages proves the truth of the theory of biology, because the older the shells are, the simpler their living remains are and as such the study of the nearest rocks according to the geological time table Such complex organism remains are found
