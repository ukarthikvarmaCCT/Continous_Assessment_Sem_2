 Client side / web browser technologies used in Web 2
0 - Asynchronous javascript and XML, Adobe Flash and javascript / Ajax Fremwork such as Yahoo! UI Library, Dojo Toolkit, mootools and jquery
 Ajax programming uses javascript to upload and download new data, without reloading an entire page from the web server
 upyogkarta ko pej par kaam karne kii anumati dene ke liye, sarwar se hone vaale sanchaar jaise ki data anurodhon ko pej par vaapis aa rahe data se alag kiya jaataa he
 
 Otherwise, the user must regularly wait for the data to be returned before doing anything on that page, just as the user waits for a page to reload
 isse site kaa samgr pradarshan bhi badhata he, chunki bina kisi baadha yaa line ke tezi se anurodh bheje ja sakate hai or graahak ko data bheja ja saktaa he
 The data retrieved by an Ajax request is typically formatted as XML or JSON, two widely used structured data formats
 chunki in donon praroopon ko javascript aasaani se samaj sakati he, ek programmer aasaani se unka upyog apane web program main sanrachit data transmit karne ke liye kar sakate hai

 Weapons can be used to attack, defend or intimidate

 The main weapons of this period were stone axes, mace and knives

 Around 4,000 years BC By the time man had found the address of the metal
 taanbe or raange ko milakar usne kaansa bananaa janaa ore tab dhire-dhire pathar ke shastron kaa sthaan kaanse ke shastron ne le liya
 Weapons of this period, especially of the bow, arrow, spear, knife, spear, ax and mace, and only the shield of bronze are found in defensive tools

 Mukta - The weapons that were thrown

 Some scholars have given the following 3 characteristics of weapons - prasiddh sainya vichaarak je epa si fuller ne hathiyaaron main nimnlikhit visheshtaon kaa hona anivaary bataaya he- In addition to the above qualities, it is also necessary to have the following qualities in the best weapons - sharir ke vibhinn angon kii raksha kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 For example, leather and armor for the body, head for head and neck for neck etc
 europe main bhi isi prakaar ke shastr banate the
 The 12th-century armor was made by kneading small pieces of iron
 jirahabakhtar sundar or suvidhajanak avashya tha, par baari shastron kii chot se purnataya raksha nahin kar saktaa tha
 Hence from the 13th century AD, iron sheet coverings were made in Europe and they were worn over the mesh
 yoddha ab sir se paanv tak pattakvach se dhakaa rahata tha
 The joints in these armors were maintained for easy movement of body components
 peeche ashv ke liye bhi liye bhi aisa hi kavach banane laga
 The trap was also made for both horse and man
 savaar or ashv ke kavach kaa bhaar 200 se 300 pound tak hota tha
 The power of weapons also increased in the 13th century
 angrejon kaa lanbaa dhanush itnaa shaktishaalee hota tha ki usase chalaaya baan saadhaaran kavchon ko bhed detaa tha
 This bow was six feet long and its six foot arrow could shoot up to 250 yards easily
 isi prakaar switzaraland kaa 'hellbird kulhada' tha
 Its shaft was eight feet and along with the ax, it also had a serpentine fork to pull the spear and rider into it
 daksh ladaaka isaki chot se achche kavach ko bhi kaat saktaa tha
 The invention of gunpowder gave such power in the hands of man that changed the design of war
 yah nishchit he ki 14veen shatabdi ke aarambh main aagneyastra ban chuke the
 The first firearms were cannons
 yah mukhyat: do prakaar kii banaai gai - ek choti nalwali or duusari lambii naliwali 
 These cannons were first made of copper and bronze and then made of iron
 15veen shatabdi main topein 30 inch paridhi kii hoti thim or 1,200 se 1,500 pound bhaar ke pathar ke gole chalaati thim
 Modern howitzers and heavy fieldguns are developed forms of mortar and bombard
 isi shatabdi ke ant tak choti haath kii topein baniin
 They were replaced by hand guns in the early 15th century
 isi kaa vikaas dhire-dhire musket, machalock, flintlock or aadhunik rifl main hua
 The efforts of making rapid-firing guns and the use of this connection started from the 16th century and this led to the first successful machine gun in 1884
 aaj kii mashinagan ek minute main kai sau goliyaan tak chalaa sakati he
 Other important weapons were also invented in the 14th to 16th centuries, such as hand bombs, bronze explosive shells, pistols, dahk shells, etc
 shastron kaa adhik vikaas aadhunik kaal main hua
 By the 16th century, firearms had become so influential that man's defensive armor was in vain
 san 1915 kaa manushya aagneyastra ke saamne asahaay rahaa, parantu isi varsh pratham kavachayaan kaa nirmaan hua
 Man could now escape from the attack of light firearms by sitting in this car made of thick sheets of steel
 bandook, rifl or topon ke kaarykaran kaa siddhant ek hi he
 The gunpowder is kept in a strongly closed vessel on three sides and after that the vessel is temporarily sealed from the fourth side by placing a pellet, bullet or shot
 phir barood main kisi yukti se aag laga di jaati he
 The gunpowder is immediately burnt and converted into gases
 atyant kam sthaan main utpann hone ke kaaran ye gaisen bahut sampidit rahati hai
 Therefore, they press the pellets, pellets or shells very forcefully
 gola jab tak yantra ke naal main chalata rahata he tab tak usapar daab padati rahati he or uskaa veg badhata rahata he
 Thus a lot of velocity is produced in it
 naal ke kaaran uski disha bhi nirdhaarit ho jaati he; isliye naal ko ghuma firaakar gole ko icchaanusaar lakshya par maaraa ja saktaa he
 There is definite evidence of the use of cannon in Europe from 1313 AD
 bharat main babar ne panipat kii ladaai main topon kaa pehle-pehle prayog kiya
 The first cannons were made of bronze and were molded
 parantu aisi topein paryaapt pusht nahin hoti thim
 They used to burst by putting more ammo in them
 is dosha ko dur karne ke liye unke upar lohe ke challe tapt karke khub kasakar chadha die jate the
 When frost, such rings shrink and hold the inner cord very firmly, just as the wheel mounted on top of the bullock cart is pressed
 adhik pushtataa ke liye challe chadhaane ke pehle naal par lambaai ke anudish bhi lohe kii chaden ek duusari se sataakar rakh di jaati thim
 a famous cannon of the time is Mons Meg, which is now placed on the fortress of Edinburgh to adorn
 iske baad lagbhag 200 varshon tak top banane main koi vishesh unnati nahin hui
 In this era, the cluster of drains was smooth
 parantu lagbhag san 1520 main germany ke ek top banaanevaale ne sanchhidr main sarpilaakaar khaanche bananaa aarambh kiya
 This cannon consisted of longitudinal "shells" instead of circular shells
 sanchhidr main sarpilaakaar khaanchon ke kaaran prakshipt pind veg se naachne lagata he
 Thus the dancing object deviates much less from resistance to air and consequently falls more truthfully at the target
 1855 i
 main lard armastrang ne pitwaan lohe kii top kaa nirmaan kiya, jisamen pehle kii topon kii tarah munh kii ore se barood aadi bhari jane ke badale peeche kii ore se dhakkan hataakar yah sab saamagree bhari jaati thi
 40 pounds of it were filled in it
 saadhaaran topon main prakshipt bade veg se nikalataa he or top kii naal ko bahut unchi disha main nahin laayaa ja saktaa he
 On the other hand, small cannon guns are light and there is not much velocity in the projectile coming out of them, but they have the quality that the projectile falls very high up and down and hence it can kill the enemy hiding behind the wall, hill etc
 inhen morter kehete hai
 a cannon of mid-size is called a howitzer
 jaise-jaise topon ke banane main unnati hui vaise-vaise mortaron or houvitzron ke banane main bhi unnati hui
 In almost all countries, there was an advance in the manufacture of guns in the same way, because there was equal competition
 jab koi ek desh aadhik baari, adhik shaktishaalee yaa adhik furti se gola daagnevaali top banaata to baat bahut dinon tak chhipi na rahati or pratidwandvi deshon kii cheshtaa hoti ki usase bhi acchhee top banaai jaay
 In 1898, the French made a cannon that was to guide the guns that were made after that
 usase nikle prakshipt kaa veg adhik tha; uskaa aropan saraahneey tha; daagne par purnataya sthir rahata tha, kyonki aropan main aise daine lage the jo bhoomi main dhansakar top ko kisi dish main hilne na dete the
 All cannons retreat when fired
 is dhakke ke veg ko ghataane ke liye dravon kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 Its projections were made of thin walls
 inamen se prayek kii tol lagbhag 12 pound thi or usamen lagbhag saadhe teen pound ucch visphoti barood rahati thi
 There was also a cap containing special chemicals in the projectile, which caused the projectile to explode upon reaching the target and the pieces used to injure the enemy far and wide
 yah diwaar ke peeche chhipe sainikon ko bhi maar sakati he
 In the First World War, the Germans built a cannon called 'big Bertha', from which they started shelling 75 miles from Paris
 is top main koi nayaa siddhant nahin tha
 The cannon was only sufficiently large and athletic
 parantu hawaii jahaajon tathaa anya naveen yantron ke avishkaar se aisi topein ab luptpraaya ho gai hai
 The fireballs follow the same principle on which the ammunition arrows left on Deepawali
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke antim varsh main agnibaan bahut kaaryakari siddh hue
 There were 30 fireballs three-three inches in diameter and each one was filled with explosives called chordite
 prayek ke sir kaa bhaar 29 pound tha
 Each fire could go from 3,900 to 8,000 yards when fired
 prayek bijli ke switch se daaga jaataa tha
 These switches could either be arranged in such a way that the fireballs keep dropping automatically for half a second or as many fireballs or total fireballs at the same time
 ucch visphotak ke is ekaek dhamaake se shatru kii sena ko baari kshati pahunchati thi or vah atyant bhaybheet ho jaaya karti thi
 At the end of the Second World War, Germany created fireplaces with no human operator and far reaching names, named V-S and V-2
 dekhne main ve-ek vayuyan ke samaan hota tha
 It contained 130 gallons of petrol and the machine used to weigh about one ton
 udate samay iskaa veg 350 mile prati ghanta ho jaataa tha or chalane main yah bhayanak dhwani utpann karata tha
 a picture of V-2 is shown together
 isamen alcohol or drav oxygen kaa prayog hota tha
 Each arrow contained about three tons of alcohol and five tons of liquid oxygen
 iskaa mahattam veg lagbhag 3,000 mile prati ghanta tha
 The device was shaped like a cigar and about a tonne without fuel load
 vayuyan itane veg se chalate rahete hai ki unako top se maar giraanaa kathin hi hota tha, parantu amareeki vaigyanikon ne radar or vayuyanaghatak topon kaa aisa sambandh joda ki top apane aap vayuyan par sadhi rahati thi
 This was the victory over flying bombs of 1944, as these radar cannons killed about 70 percent of such bombs
 ye kai prakaar ke hote hai
 Some of the major bombs used in today's war are the following: 1
 vikhandak bam 2
 vidhvansak bam 3
 agnibam 4
 rasinic bam 5
 jeevanu bam 6
 vikiran bam Fragment bomb - It contains explosive material inside a special type of metal hollow vessel
 jab yah vayuyan athwa raaket se giraane par prithvi se takaraata he to dhamaake ke saath fat jaataa he or iske tukdon se log ghayal hote hai
 Sometimes it explodes in the air at some height above the earth when it is dropped from the plane
 in bamon kaa kul bhaar 2 ki
gra
 se lekar 50 ki
gra
 tak hota he
 These bombs are usually dropped over large areas
 vidhvansak bam - iskaa bhaar 50 ki
gra
 se lekar 1,000 ki
gra
 tak hota he
 It is filled with ordinary explosives
 agni bam - ye ghani aabaadeewale shaharon tathaa bade-bade kaarkaanon par giraae jate hai jinase ve jalakar nasht ho jate hai
 In it, the incendiary material is filled with a special kind of glowing pulp
 aag lagane ke liye phosforus, nepalm or thermite electron jaise rasinic yogic prayukt kiye jate hai or tab inke naam prayukt padaarth ke anusaar bhi ho jate hai
 Chemical bomb - This is a type of balloon with a thin wall
 yah vifailli vastuon se bharaa hua hota he
 If this bomb explodes in the air above the ground or something above the ground, toxic substances, gases, liquid or solid, whatever comes out of the shell, disintegrate into the ground or air and in a few moments the cloud surrounding the blast site She takes the form
 jeevanu bam - iskaa bhaar lagbhag 75 kri
gra
 tak hota he
 It consists of several chambers
 prayek kaksh main jeevanu, rogagrast keede athwa juen bhare hote hai
 When the bomb is dropped, the fuse in it rises and at the same time the covering of its chambers, which is occupied, opens with shock and the spread of disease-causing bacteria spread in the air
 yadi is bam ke khol kaa dhakkan jameen se 30 foot par khul jaataa he to ye jeevanu lagbhag 400 varg meter main fail jate hai
 In the area where bacterial bombs are dropped, humans, animals, animals and trees etc
 can all fall victim to disease because the whole environment gets contaminated
 vikiran bam - yah rasinic bam kii tarah hota he lekin iskaa khol kuch patala rahata he
 Inside it is filled with radium-explosive material
 visphot hone par ye padaarth dhul kii tarah hawa main mil jate hai jisase vahaan kii hawa radiumdharmi padaarthon se sandooshit ho jaati he
 In this way, the people there suffer from radioactive radiogenic diseases
 ye parmaanu bam evam hydrogen bam se bhi adhik bhayanak siddh hue hai
 These are the weapons that do not cause any explosion when dropped
 jeevanu astr main rog failaanevaale jeevanu hote hai or jis yuddh main ye istemaal kiye jate hai vah bahut bibhats evam sanhaarak hota he
 In the First World War, 51,259 American soldiers died on the battlefield, but after that the number of people who died of bacterial disease was 51,447
 pracheen kaal main log rogi ke shav ko dushmano ke ghere main daal dete the taaki unki mrityu jeevanuon ke madhyam se hone lage
 They are used as weapons in war and are of many types
 ye manushyon, pashuon tathaa paudhon main sankramak rog failaate hai
 They are used to reduce the enemy's ability to fight
 ye jeevanu uchit vaataavaran paane par bahut kam samay main lakhon sainikon ko rogagrast kar dete hai
 Many types of bacteria are used as a war weapon and each type of bacteria spreads different types of infectious diseases
 rog failaanevaale jeevanuon ke liye jin vibhinn sadhano kaa upyog sambhav he unamem se kuch sadhano ke naam nimnlikhit hai : Once released, these microorganisms are dispersed in the air and spread over thousands of miles along the air
 udaahranarth basilai ko airosol ke dwaara samudratat se 240 kimi kii lambaai main chhod diya jaae to ye apane aap 1,30,800 varg kimi bhubhag main fail jaayenge
 Thus, these bacteria spread diseases in that area
 aisa paaya gaya he ki astron ke hamale se maranevaale sainikon kii apeksha in rogaanuon ke sankraman se maranevaale sainikon kii sankhya adhik hoti he
 The immense ability to breed bacteria makes bacterial weapons more deadly
 yadi ye jeevanu ek baar jate hai to inhen nasht karnaa aasaan nahin hota
 These bacteria do not have any specific color, taste and smell
 in visheshtaon ke kaaran jeevanu astron kaa mahatv din-prati-din badhata ja rahaa he
 Mukesh Chand Mathur, popularly known simply as Mukesh, was a prominent playback singer of Hindi cinema
 mukesh kii awaz bahut khubasurat thi par unke ek dur ke rishtedaar motilal ne unhen tab pahachaanaa jab unhone use apni bahan kii shaadi main gaate hue suna
 Motilal took him to Bombay and allowed him to stay in his house
 yahi nahin unhone mukesh ke liye riyaaz kaa puraa intjaam kiya
 During this time Mukesh got the job of the lead artist in a Hindi film Innocent
 parshv gayak ke taur par unhen apana pehla kaam 1945 main film pehali nazar main mila
 The first song that Mukesh sang in a Hindi film was Dil Jalta Hai to Jalne De in which the actress Motilal did it
 is geet main mukesh ke adarsh gayak ke el sahagal ke prabhaav kaa asar saafe-saafe nazar aata he
 In 1959, he received the Filmfare Award for Best Playback Singing for the song 'subha Sikha Learned Hum Nae Sikhi Hoshiari' from the film Anari
 1974 main mukesh ko rajanigandha film main "kai baar yun bhi dekha he" gaanaa gane ke liye rashtriya film puraskaar mila
 He suffered a heart attack and died in 1976 while on a tour in the Detroit city of the United States
 inkaa janm 22 july 1923 ko ludhiana ke joravar chand maathur or chand rani ke ghar hua tha
 His elder sister used to study music and Mukesh used to listen to him with great fervor
 motilal ke ghar mukesh ne sangeet kii parmparik shiksha leni shuru kii, lekin inaki dili khwaahish hindi filmon main bataur abhinayta pravesh karne kii thi
 After coming to Mumbai, he got his first break in 1941 as an actor singer in the film "innocence"
 industry main shuruaati daur mushkilon bharaa tha
 But KL Sehgal liked his voice a lot
 inke gane ko sun ke el sahagal bhi duvidha main pad gayi the
 Mukesh had his own playback singing style in the 40s
 naushaad ke saath unki jugalbandi ek ke baad ek superhit gane de rahi thi
 At that time, most songs in Mukesh's voice were filmed on Dilip Kumar
 50 ke dashak main inhen ek nayi pahchaan mili, jab inhen rajkpur kii awaz kaha jane laga
 In many interviews, Raj Kapoor himself has said about his friend Mukesh that i am just a body, my soul is Mukesh
 parshv gayak mukesh ko film industry main apana makaam hasil kar lene ke baad, kuch nayaa karne kii chaah jaagi or isliye inhone film nirmaataa ban gayi
 Produced the film 'malhar' in 1951 and 'anurag' in 1956
 abhinay kaa shauk bachapan se hone ke kaaran ‘mashooqa’ or ‘anuraag’ main bataur hero bhi aaye
 But both these films flopped at the box office
 kehete hai ki is daur main mukesh aarthik tangi se jujh rahe the
 Mukesh did not succeed as an actor-producer
 galatiyon se sabak lete hue phir se suron kii mehfil main laut aaye
 In the last years of the 50s, Mukesh again reached the peak of playback singing
 yahudee, madhumati, anaadi jaisi filmon ne unki gayaki ko ek nayi pahchaan di or phir ‘jis desh main ganga bahati he’ ke gane ke liye ve filmafere puraskaar ke liye namankit hue
 Mukesh started the 60s with kalyanji-anandji, k dum-dum diga-diga, Naushad's Mere Pyaar Bhi Tu Hai, and SD Burman's songs and then composed by shankar-jaikishan in Raj Kapoor's film Sangam Kiya song, for which he was again nominated for Filmfare
 60 ke dashak main mukesh kaa kariyar apane charam par tha or ab mukesh ne apni gayaki main naye prayog shuru kar diye the
 According to the actors of the time, his singing was also changing
 jaise ki sunil dutt or manoj kumaar ke liye gaaye geet
 Mukesh made his debut in the 70s by singing live here, dying here
 us vakt ke har bade filmi sitaron kii ye awaz ban gayi the
 In 1970, Mukesh received a second Filmfare for the song Manoj Kumar's film Pehchan, and in 1972 he received the Filmfare Award for the third time for singing Manoj Kumar's film
 ab mukesh zyaadaatar kalyanji-aanndji, lakshmikant-pyarelal or aar di burman jaise diggaj sangeetkaaron ke saath kaam kar rahe the
 In 1974, Mukesh was given the National Film Award for the song Rajinigandha
 vinod mehara or firoz khan jaise naye abhinaytaon ke liye bhi inhone gane gaaye
 Even in the 70s, he gave many superhit songs like - one day the film Dharam Karam will be sold

 In inorganic chemicals, the salts formed by the action of phosphoric acid and alkalis are called phosphates
 carbonic rasayan main phophoric amla ke easter ko phosphate yaa arganophosphate kehete hai
 Organic phosphates have great importance in biochemistry and the environment
 acarbonic phosphate khaanon se nikaale jate hai or unase phosphorus praapt kiya jaataa he jo krishi evam udyogon main upyogi he
 If orthophosphoric acid is mixed with sodium hydroxide, three orthophosphates will be formed by the ratio of acid and alkali, which are called monosodium-dihydrogen-phosphate, disodium-hydrogen-phosphate, and trisodium phosphate, respectively
 inhen praathmik, dwitiyak tathaa tritiyak phosphet bhi kaha jaataa he
 Three types of salt phosphates are possible due to phosphorylation of phosphoric acid
 in teenon prakaaron main sodium, potacium tathaa ammonium ke phospheton kaa chhodkar praaia: anya sabhi dveiksharaki tathaa trikshawraki phosphet jal main aviley hai
 Entire monophosphate is soluble in water
 praaia: sabhi phosphet salfurik amla, hydrochloric amla, nitric amla, fasforic amla, tathaa aseetic amla main viley hai
 All alkaline phosphates are highly alkaline, alkaline phosphates are less alkaline and primary phosphates are less acidic
 orthophospheton ko sambandhit tatwon ke oxide, hydroxide yaa carbonate tathaa phosphoric amla kii kriya se praapt kiya jaataa he
 Alkaline phosphates can be obtained by common decomposition
 garam karne par trikshawraki phosphet sthaayee rahete he tathaa dveiksharaki pirophosphet banate hai, jabaki praathmik phospheton ko garam karne par jal kii haani hone se metacosphet banate hai
 Pyro and metaphosphate are minor solutes in water
 crystalia phospheton main orthophosphet pirophosphet tathaa triphosphet pramukh hai
 In addition, the presence of tetrophosphate and higher phosphates is also indicated, but they are not confirmed by X-rays and chemical methods
 acristali phospheton main kaanchiya phosphet bade mahatvapurn hai, jo metacospheton ko ucch taap par galaakar phir mand gati se thandha karne par praapt hote hai
 They are also called cyclic phosphates
 ye jaleey vidyudvishleshan par runayan utpann karte hai
 Metaphosphate chains break down easily in the presence of alkalis
 orthophospheton kaa bhi jaleey vidyut-vishleshan hota he
 Orthophosphate, when heated with ammonium malibdt and nitric acid, forms a yellow precipitate
 yah inaki pariksha main sahaayak hota he
 Metaphosphate with suture nitrate forms white precipitate, while orthophosphate yellow
 magnesium sulphate ko ammoni hydroxide ke saath kshareey banaakar jab orthophosphet ke saath mishrit karke garm kiya jaataa he, tab ek shwet avakshep banataa he, kintu metacosphet ke saath koi avakshap nahin banataa
 Phosphates are most commonly used in the manufacture of phosphate fertilizers
 prakruti main chattaneey-phospheton main tricalsium phosphet paaya jaataa he, jisapar salfurik amla kii kriya se superphosphate banaaya jaataa he
 It is abundant as fertilizer

 Goa Velha is located on an ancient harbor called "gowapuri" or "gokapattana", which was built by the Kadamba dynasty in the 11th century on the banks of the river Juwari
 govpuri pehle kadamb rajvansh or tatpashchaat vijaynagar samrajya ke mahatvapurn bandargahon main se ek tha
 In the fifteenth century, a number of wars were fought between the Sultanates of the Deccan and the Vijayanagara Empire over the control of the Goa region, which resulted in the control of the Adilshahas of Bijapur Bijapur

 Additionally, the Juvari River had to retreat from the harbor due to silt

 : Template: Time Topics rai bichali-naand0i, paudi tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat gadhwal mandal ke paudi jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Right from the beginning of civilization, philosophy has been a subject of special interest among the learned people
 bharat main vedon evam upanishdon ke samay se hi darshanik jigyaasa evam darshanik chintan kaa gyanpipasu prichhasheel vidwaanon or buddhajiviyon ke bich prachlit pratishthit rahe
 For example, in the Rigveda, questions were raised in a poetic manner in relation to the beginning of the universe, the material substance of the visible world and the creator
 prasiddh naradiya sookt is koti kii prashnakulata tathaa jigyaasa kaa shreshth nidarshan he
 It is important to note that the Rigveda is often the oldest example of linguistic literature
 rugveda kaa rachana-kaal praayah 3000 se 1500 i
 pus
 ke bich mana jaataa he
 The oldest Upanishads are considered to be compositions before the eighth century BCE
 unamem aatma ke swaroop aadi se sambaddh jigyaasa sarvatra mukherit he
 It would not be said that the Upanishads had a wide and serious impact on the development of later philosophies that occurred in India
 dhyaan dene yogya he ki darshan ke itihaas main uski paribhaasha, swaroop or uski pramukh samasyaon kii avadharana main parivartan hote rahe hai
 In ancient times, two major centers of philosophical thought were made, one was India and the other was Greece
 in donon kshetron main darshan kii paribhaasha yaa pariklpana tatva-sambandhi mimasaa athwa tatvagyan ke rup main kii gayi
 It is known here that in ancient times, the science, not even the physical science, could emerge
 faltah vishwa-jagat or jivan se sambandhit saare prashn darshan main samahit hote the
 In ancient Greece thinkers such as the Thalis asked the question what is the root product of the visible world
 vibhinn darshanikon ne ukt prashn ke alag-alag uttar diye
 In the ancient times, modern methods of experimentation were not invented, nor did machines like telescope and atomic scanning
 us yug main gyaan kaa strot chakshu aadi indriyaan thim or ek seemaa tak anumaan karanevaali buddhi
 In the light of the experience of the senses, it was imagined in Greece and in our country that five or four factors are the cause of the distribution of visible things
 yunaan ke praarambhik vichaarkon ne pani, hawa, agni main se ek yaa duusare mahabhoot ko mul tatva ghoshit kiya, jabaki bharatvarsh main nyaay vaisheshik darshanon ne paanchon mahabhuton ko mul tatva swikar kiya
 In the Upanishads, the spirit or Brahm took the place of great powers and the subject of philosophy became the determination of the nature of the soul
 vishwa kaa multatv brahm yaa aatma he or darshan kaa uddeshy ukt aatma ke gyaan kaa sampaadan he
 Thus philosophy was conceived as philosophy
 yahan dhyatavya he ki jahaan nyaay-vaisheshik darshanon main prameya anek hai, vahaan veydant kahi jane vaali vichaar- paddatiyon main ekmaatr gyey tatva aatma yaa brahm he
 So, according to the elders, philosophy is philosophy and atmanism or self-discovery
 darshan kii duusari pramukh shakha gyanamimasaa he, jo gyaan ke swaroop or sadhano par vichaar karti he
 In India, most development of this branch took place in the judiciary, which made the evidence of direct, inference etc
, ie their form-determination, a special topic of thinking
 baharaveen shatabdi ke baad to, tathakthith navyanyay ke pravartan ke baad, nyaayadarshan purnataya pramaan mimasaa main samahit ho gaya
 Today the above definition of philosophy, that philosophy is philosophy or philosophy, is no longer acceptable
 jise ham tatv kehete hai, uske anek rup hai
 In the world, the primacy is of the physical element or elements
 hamaari prithvi, soramandal or asankhya tarak-samooh bhautik tatwon se nirmit he; yahi baat hamaare sharir evam indriyon par bhi lagu he
 The power of the soul remains relevant even today
 kintu sharir or bhautik jagat ke vividh roopon or nirmaayak tatwon kaa adhyayan vibhinn bhautik vigyaan karte hai
 Today the definitions of water, air, fire etc
 given by the Vaishika philosophy appear to be preliminary
 pracheen unani vichaarkon or maharishi kanad ko yah pataa nahin tha ki jise ham vaayu yaa jal kehete hai, vah ek rasinic tatva nahin he, apitu ekaadhik tatwon kaa mishran yaa yogic he
 The point to note is that if we do not follow the principle of Vedanta that the essence of the world is spirit or Brahma, then there is no reason to accept that the subject of philosophy is the basic element of the world
 vishwa kaa mul tatv ek yaa anek kotiyon ke parmaanu bhi ho sakate hai or rinatmak evam dhanatmak vidyudanu yaa vidyut-tarangen athwa chumbakeey kshetra yaa or vidyut kshetra
 Surely philosophy cannot study these elements
 darshan ke itihaas se ek or baat saamne aati he
 It is said that 'munde-munde Mataribhinna' and that 'naiko Munyarisya Vachah Pramanam' means that different philosophical thinkers have given different views
 pracheen kaal main apane desh main chah aastik or utane hi naastik darshan bane
 Later, under the philosophy called Vedanta, almost the same sect became, shaiva-shakta philosophy became different
 yadi ham pashchim kii ore dekhe to vahaan pracheen unani vichaarkon se shuru karke ab tak kai darjan darshanik sampradaay ban-bighad chuke hai
 Due to this situation, many times in the history of philosophy, the question was raised why such fierce differences occur between philosophers
 
 The French philosopher Dekart, the originator of modern European philosophy, confounded with the question that philosophy should adopt a method of mathematics where there is no scope for doubt
 pashchim ke darshanik-itihaas main yah prashn baad main bhi kai baar uthaaya gaya he
 The main reason for this has been the continuous progress of science, which has made unprecedented industrial advancement and technological breakthroughs possible today
 europe ke chintakon ne is prashn par vichaar karte hue ki darshan ke kshetra main kyon nirantar matbhed bane rahete hai or kyon vahaan vigyaan kii pragati hoti dikhaai nahin detii, anekavidh suzav diye hai
 In this context, the famous philosopher Bertrand Russell can be mentioned here
 darshan ke us vibhaag yaa shakha ke saamne, jise tatv-mimasaa kehete hai, tathakthith tarkanishtha anubhavvaadiyon or bhavvaadiyon ne vishesh prakhar or gambheer yaa khataranaak prashn-chihn lagaaya
 It is well known that scientific examinations are conducted on the test of sensible facts available in the sense experience
 sthiti yah he ki paramparaagat tatv mimasaa ke adhikansh vaktavyon yaa mantavyon kii waisi pariksha sambhav nahin he
 This is the reason why the principles of metaphysics take the form of such speculations, which cannot be related to visible facts
 yahi mul kaaran he ki pracheen kalpanavilasi darshan ek-duusare kaa khandan karte hue kisi bhi mudde par ekamat nahin ho pate
 Scientific research and theory can only be the true foundation of our world-related concepts
 kahana nahin hoga ki vaigyanik anveshan-pranali kaa mahatva uski safaltaaon dwaara nirmit praudyogic tathaa takneekee pragati se pramanit he
 Argumentative empiricists criticized traditional philosophy as the most incisive thing to shock it, that the statements of metaphysics are not only correct, but meaningless
 sarthak kathan keval ve hai jinka gochar tathyon kii kasuti par nirikshan kiya ja sake
 Since the statements of orthodoxy — epistemology — are not testable by transcendent experience or senses — as are the statements of science — they must therefore be considered meaningless
 taatpary yah he ki apane mantavyon kii pariksha main vigyaan jis pranali kaa upyog karata he vahi pranali vishwasaneey gyaan de sakati he
 Philosophy does not take shelter of scientific exploration system, hence its progress is not seen and it continues to be a playground of continuous differences
 nishkarsh yah he ki darshan kaa koi mantavy nishchayatmak nahin ho paata
 Above we have presented the anti-philosophical intent of rational empiricists
 unke matanusaar yah kathan ki ‘ishwar jagat kaa karta he’ athwa ‘mrityu ke baad aatma swarg yaa narak main jaati he’ na sahi kaha ja saktaa he na galat, vah vastav main nirarthak he
 a strange situation arises here
 tarkanishtha anubhavvaadiyon kaa ukt mantavy ek prakaar kaa darshanik matvaad he, na ki vaigyanik
 This definition of a meaningful statement and the criterion that it is testable by sense, does not apply to itself; The said criterion or definition is not verifiable or testable by any visible fact
 vastav main vah ek prastaav maatr he
 We find this proposal interesting because today we feel overwhelmed by the success of science
 vigyaan aaj ke yug kaa sabase bada sarokaar or chamatkaar he
 He dominates philosophy
 dhyatavya he ki pashchim deshon main vigyaan darshan naam kii darshan kii ek nayi shakha hi gathit ho gayi he, jiskaa vishesh anushilan kiya ja rahaa he
 The fact is that the philosophy of any country or era makes that area or areas of culture its subject which people of that country or era find important
 udhaaharan ke liye, hamaare desh ke pracheen kaal main buddhi sampann vichaarkon kaa sabase bada sarokaar moksh tha
 As a result, there was a very serious and varied thought regarding salvation here
 sankhya or veydant ne moksh kii ek avadharana pallavit kii, jainon or baudhon ne duusari avadharanaayen nirupit kin
 According to the above three, liberation of life in some form or the other is possible, whereas in the opinion of devout philosophers like Ramanuja, such liberation is not possible
 isi prakaar moksh ke sadhano ke bare main anek mat pratipaadit kiye gayi or anek margon kii sifaarish kii gayi-jaise gyanmarg, karmmarg, bhaktimaarg, yogamarg or anekavidh tantrik sadhanaayen
 In the field of politics, monarchy often ran in our country
 yunaan main mukhyatah ganraajya viksit hue
 As a result, the philosophers there pondered many forms on the nature and ideals of the state
 vartmaan yorape main bhi janatantr, samaajwaad, samyawad, aadi anek raajnneetik vichaardhaaraon kaa pratipaadan hua
 Ethics has been an important philosophical discipline in Western countries since the time of the Greeks
 apane desh ke darshanik moksh-darshan main itani adhik ruchi lete the ki unhone naitikta tathaa rajya-sambandhi prashnon ko mahatva nahin diya
 The burden of thinking in relation to duty, state, etc
 was put on the memorials, who continued to preach more than thought and discussion
 upar hamane tarkanishtha anubhavvaad kaa zikr kiya
 Resolving the philosophy of philosophy, the supporters of the above debate redefined the philosophy
 unke anusaar darshan kaa kaary pratyayatmak vishleshan he
 Philosophy analyzes various suffixes and sentences or statements with a view to clarify their sensory experience or relation to the transcending world
 jis kathan kaa sambandh gochar jagat se nahin dikhaaya ja saktaa, uske bare main yah shankaa honi chahie ki vah sarthak bhi he yaa nahin
 In the same way, various other methods should also be analyzed
 vyavhaar main tarkanishtha anubhavvaadiyon ne apana dhyaan mukhyatya vigyaan ke pratyayon or kathanon par kendrit kiya
 In his opinion, the statements related to the fields of ethics, religion etc
 are not the subject of philosophical analysis because of not having relation with the world of experience; Philosophy can only indicate the futility of such statements
 duusare mahayuddh kaa ant hote-hote tarkanishtha anubhavvaad swayan hi niraakrit hone laga
 The thinkers found that while on the one hand the said principle is suffering from internal anomalies, on the other hand it is hesitant to make any authentic statement about our moral decisions
 maanav-jati kii naitik evam aadhyatmik jaruraton or anubhavon kii upeksha karne vaala darshan kaalaantar main swayan ko badnaam kar letaa he
 It is not enough to say that our ethics statements are not verifiable or testable by sense, and are therefore nonsense
 naitikta ke bina manushya arthpurna jivan nahin ji saktaa
 The same applies to spiritual and aesthetic values
 vastav main darshan jivan-mulyon kii upeksha nahin kar saktaa
 In his view, scientific perception is also a kind of value, but that perception is not the only value
 sampratyayon kaa spashtikaran bhi saral vyapaar nahin he
 Against rational empiricism, another philosophical cult arose at Oxford University in England, which uses the colloquial language for analytical understanding of suffixes etc
 yahan in vibhinn darshanik sampradaayon kaa vivaran dena abhisht nahin he
 In this context, we will proceed by saying two desirable things
 ham maanate hai ki kisi bhi pratyay yaa avadharana kaa vishleshan khaas prayojan yaa drushti kaa apekshi hota he
 We believe that philosophy should have a special vision and value
 udhaaharan ke liye ham kaaranta ke pratyay kaa vishleshan is drushti se karte hai ki gyaan-prapti ke anushthan main ham uski upyogita or mahatva ko thik-thaak aankh saken
 The determination of the exact meaning of a statement, which is possible by analysis, is made to know how far that statement captures or captures reality or reality
 vaigyanik bodh kaa vishleshan bhi isi drushti se kiya jaataa he-arthath yatharth kii sambaddhta main uski satyata yaa satyansh kaa nirdhaaran karne ke liye
 What we call science-philosophy is the use of personal vision of philosophy, that it should give proper knowledge of the nature and limitations of scientific research
 is prakaar ham kah sakate hai ki darshan kaa mukhya kaary vibhinn kotiyon ke bodhon yaa anubhavon kii samikshatmak avgati he
 It should be remembered here that philosophy can think of the same experience that has been linguized, that is, it has appeared in the form of statements
 kintu vigyaan-darshan, jo vaigyanik bodh kii samiksha karata he, vigyaan kii sahaayak vidya maatr nahin he
 Philosophy is also not intended to advance scientific investigations
 taatpary yah he ki darshan naamak vidya vigyaan kii paricharika bhar nahin he
 It can be believed that scientific investigation is an important thing, in today's era it seems to be self-evident
 lekin iskaa yah arth nahin ki vartmaan yug main jivan ke duusare mulyon or unka anveshan mahatvapurn nahin rahe
 We know that poetry, art, music and morality have always been important for human life and will continue to be so
 darshan hamaare sabhi aise mulyon ke swaroop kaa vichaar karata he jo maanav evam jivan ko gunatmak utkarsh dene vaale hai
 We believe that scientific research and thinking are not only useful in practical terms, they also provide qualitative features to the human intellect or brain
 vastav main vah prayek kriya ko, jo keval upyogita ke liye nahin hoti apitu maanav-vyaktitv ko gunatmak utkarsh dene vaali hoti he, darshan kaa vishay he
 Useful actions are rituals for wealth and power
 ve mukhyatah manushya ke bhautik tathaa jaivi jivan ko prabhavit karti hai, ve khaas tarah ke manobhaavon kii pushti ke liye hi hitkar hoti hai
 But she makes qualitative development of personality, it is doubtful
 hamaare vyaktitv kaa vaisaa vikaas nishkaam bhav se gyaan-sampaadan, naitik karm tathaa kavy- sahitya evam kalaon ke aswaad dwaara ghatit hota he
 We believe that the work of philosophy is the reviewed consciousness of all human actions whose goal is the attainment of qualitative flourishing — or the attainment of joy that is supported by the qualitative upward movement of the personality
 visheshtah kavy-sahitya or vibhinn vidyaon kaa anushilan ukt koti kii kriyaayein hai
 The observance of moral duty is almost always satisfying, even if the expenditure of money, time, power, etc
 is to be spent for performing that duty
 kartavya-paalan kaa sukh duusare sukhon se bhinn koti kaa hota he
 It is the pleasure of the conscience
 jo mahapraan vyakti ko apane swaarth kaa hanan karke parahit-sadhana karata he, use khaas tarah kaa anand hota he
 Qualitatively, this joy is the joy of transitioning or wandering on a higher moral plane
 taatpary yah he ki swabhaavatah apni chetana-vrittiyon ke utthan kii kaamana karata he
 When a book, artwork or classical article gives our consciousness the opportunity to upgrade or uplift it, it seems interesting and enjoyable
 hamaari dharna ke anusaar ukt koti ke gunatmak prabhedon ko dekhnaa, samajhnaa-or samajhane ke liye vyakhya-sutron kii udbhaavna karnaa-darshan kaa pramukh kaary he
 Thus, we can say that while different physics study quantitatively the elements or powers of their field, different branches of philosophy follow qualitative variations of different categories
 vigyaan kaa bodh hamen vastuon evam shaktiyon par niyantran kii kshamta detaa he, darshan kaa koi ang waisi kshamta nahin detaa
 It only expands and qualifies our vision or consciousness
 is pariprekshya main dekhne par ham paayenge ki jinhen ham maanviya vidyaayein kehete hai
 That is, male science, sociology, political science, economics etc
 - their position is somewhere between physical sciences and philosophy
 sankshep main ham kah sakate hai ki jahaan vigyaan or yahan hamaara matlab mukhyatah bhautik vigyaanon se he, hamen bhautik parivesh par arthath prakritik jagat par niyantran kii kshamta detaa he, vahiin darshan kaa kaary hamaare gunatmak bodh or jivan ko aage badhaata he
 Needless to say that these realizations and actions are part of our internal, symbolized or linguistic life
 pracheen upanishad athwa veydant or duusare bhartiya darshan bhi yah pratipaadit karte hai ki moksh ke sadhak ko atmagyaan sampadit karnaa chahie
 As a result, in India, respectively, it was accepted that the main goal of philosophy is self-realization - the other means of attaining salvation
 dhyatavya he ki bhartiya darshan manushya main hi nahin, pashu-pakshiyon evam keet-patingon main bhi samaan atmaaon kii upasthiti maanata he
 Conversely in Christianity it is believed that the soul is only in humans, not other beings
 bhartiya darshan ke sandarbh main duusari mahatv kii baat yah he ki aatma ekarup, nirvikaar maani jaati he
 Its form can be known forever
 hamaara mat is paramparaagat mantavy se bhinn he
 According to us, the subject of both literature and philosophy is human
 sahitya main ham prakruti tathaa duusare jeevon ko manushya kii drushti se dekhte or bodh kaa vishay banaate hai
 Tulsidas said that the real work of poetic literature should be the praise of God and not of Prakrit Nara
 iske vipareet ham sahitya main manushya ko hi pratishthit karne kii sifaarish kar rahe hai
 Rama and Krishna could become subjects of poetic literature as far as they did man-made activities
 is prakaar-jaisaa ki angrezi kavi pope ne kaha he-hamaare or darshan ke, adhyayan-anushilan kaa pramukh, shaayad ekmaatr, vishay manushya he
 And here it is a vision that man is a historical and developing animal
 manushya kaa gyaan nirantar viksit ho rahaa he, jiskaa matlab he ki uski chetana nirantar prasaranshil he
 This consciousness is related to the fact-world, and also to the value-world
 taatpary yah ki manushya kaa jagat-bodh, aatm-bodh evam mulya-bodh ye sab nirantar parivartit or viksit ho rahe hai
 In the ancient Sanskrit language, where 'world' and 'world' underline the dynamics of the world, names like 'achala' of the earth indicate that the ancient people were not familiar with the dynamics of the earth
 matlab yah he ki aaj kaa khagolashastra pracheen khagolavidya se bhinn he, isi prakaar hamaara prakruti-jagat kaa gyaan nirantar badalata-viksata rahaa he
 Similarly, our value perception has also changed, it has been happening
 aaj ke janatantri yug main ham yah sweekaar nahin karte ki tathakthith raja yaa shaasha main devtaa nivas karata yaa karti he, yaa yah ki vah manushya rup main devtaa hota he
 Similarly, today we do not give much importance to the satti of a woman and we are not able to depend on the salutations of the servants
 aaj factry ke mazdoor union banaate or vidroh kaa paath padhate hai
 Today's sons and daughters do not obey and serve their parents as much as in the story of Shravan Kumar and Ram
 aaj ham vedon or shastron main bhi purv yugon kii jaisi aasthaa nahin rakhte
 Many Hindus of today do not consider it necessary to pay obeisance to the deceased father and grandfather, feeding Brahmins every year on their occasion
 taatpary yah he ki aaj kaa nitibodh puraane yugon se nitant bhinn hota ja rahaa he
 The thing to note is that human beings are also bearers of this changed value and world perception
 is manushya kaa, inhen kaarnon se, chetanadharmee swabhaav yaa swaroop badalata ja rahaa he
 Philosophy is a study of the nature of this ever-evolving consciousness-conscious human being
 jahaan vibhinn maanviya vigyaan ukt manushya ko yatharth sthiti yaa yatharthata ko pakadaney kii koshish karte hai, vahaan darshan uskaa anushilan manushya ke gunatmak vikaas kii drushti se karata he
 There is one more thing
 darshan jis manushya kaa adhyayan karata he vah maatr indriyagochar bhautik ikai nahin he
 a creature named Man is the carrier of its evolving, self-righteous culture; The culture that benefits mainly in the form of symbols of language etc
 and which continues to grow as a legacy from generation to generation
 is drushti se kaha ja saktaa he ki darshan kaa vishay manushya kii ve pratikbaddh saanskrithik kriyaayein athwa saanskrithik rachanaayen hai jo pratikon kaa aashray lekar apane ko aapekshik arth main sthir banaatin chalati hai
 Philosophy is the study of man, but he does not study the physical existence or personality of man
 iske vipareet vah manushya kii un saanskrithik kriyaaon kaa anushilan karata he jo usamen gunatmak utkarsh kaa aadhaan karti hai
 In this sense, philosophy is the self-consciousness of the highest cultural activities of man
 darshan manushya ke saanskrithik aatm kaa anushilan or bodh he
 Above we presented a humanistic interpretation of the nature of philosophy
 prashn he, kisi bhi samasya ke sandarbh main darshan kaa prasthaan bindu kya hota he yaa hona chahie
 The departure point of any science or scientific thought is often a problem, a problem or a question that impedes the progress of a particular science or progress
 darshan ke kshetra main atkav daalane vaali samasya prachlit moolyabodh ke ek yaa duusare kshetra main ghatit kranti yaa doorgaami parivartan hota he
 Generally, being a carrier of critical degeneration, philosophy tries to represent and interpret the inner-most sense of values
 yah nirupan or vyakhya yugin mulya chetana se sambaddh rahati he
 It can be said from a point of view that in every field, the philosophy is an explanation of the prevailing vision of the price-related sense of the value of its own country and to give a theoretical basis to it
 duusari drushti se vah prachlit manyataon kii samiksha or unhen nayi disha dene kii koshish kaha ja saktaa he
 For example, Varna system was established in Indian society during Manu's time
 manu se pehle purush-sookt main, swayan manusmriti tathaa anya dharm-sutara-granthon main or baad main vibhinn puraanon main prachlit varna-vyavastha ko sristipralay kii gaathaon athwa duusari kathaon ke rup main saiddhanthik aadhaar dene kaa praytn kiya gaya
 In philosophy, the doctrine of varna-system was presented in the form of rebirth and deeds of past lives
 aaj ke pragatisheel vichaarak varnbhed, rangabhed aadi kii vyavastha ko nahin maanate, faltah aaj kaa darshan arthath raajnneeti-darshan evam rajya vyavastha kaa siddhanth janatantri vichaardhaara kaa aashray lekar varnbhed evam rangabhed kaa khandan karte hue samast maanav-jati kii samanta kaa pratipaadan karata he
 In the history of Christianity, in the eyes of God, all human beings are equal, on the basis of the belief that equality of human beings has been emphasized
 isi prakaar aaj ke yug main stri ke pativraty athwa ek pati ke prati nishtha kaa utana mahatv nahin rah gaya he, pashchimi deshon main stri purush ke samaan adhikaar maangti or pati se apmaan yaa avagya paakar talaak de detii he
 Today in our country too, after the death of the husband, there are no more supporters of self-immolation by the widow and remarriage of the widow is also not considered a bad thing
 america aadi pashchimi deshon main ab talakshuda mahila ko hey drushti se nahin dekha jaataa
 The main task of philosophy is to try to understand and explain these kinds of value-related changes and to give explanatory and theoretical basis
 naitik bodh kii bhanti aadhyatm athwa religen ke kshetra main bhi manushya kaa moolyabodh badal rahaa he
 Today, we give more recognition to the Karmayogi saint who, like Gandhi, lives a life of sacrifice in the public interest - than the saint who enters the Himalayan shrines and tries to do salvation
 drashtavy he ki param sant ramakrishna paramhans ne apane priy shishy swami vivekananda ko desh ko nayaa jaagran-sandesh or vivek dene kii prerana di thi
 An important part of philosophy, it should be said, is its fundamental discipline, the epistemology, which considers the processes of editing and authenticating knowledge
 The phenomenal progress of science that has taken place here has created panic in the philosophical world
 prashn uthta he ki darshanik vichaarkon ke bich itane adhik matbhed kyon bane rahete hai ? is prashn kaa samuchit samaadhaan darshan kii gyaan-mimasaa naamak shakha ko doorgaami, talasparshi aatm-samikshan kii chunauti or prerana detaa he
 The question is, finally what are the statements of philosophy about? How to decide between true or false between statements or statements that are contradictory or different in any field of philosophy? Can there be definitive knowledge in any field of philosophy? Are there some elements in the field of philosophy, on the basis of which various objects can be declared true or false or partly true? These are big questions, thinkers on these and such questions have to think afresh
 aaj hamaare desh ke darshan main gatirodh kii sthiti he
 If our thinkers start taking serious thinking on the above questions responsibly and freely, in the light of philosophical progress from east and west to here, then surely our philosophy can get new momentum and fundamental direction or directions
 kuch puraane shikshak yah manyata rakhte hai ki darshan ke prashn or samasyaayen sarvakalik hai or yah ki unke bare main pracheen yugon kaa chintan aaj bhi utana hi mahatvapurn he, jitna ki purv yugon main tha
 Following this mentality, some students of philosophy and nurturers understand that there is no need for new thinking in the specific field of philosophy, and that the practice of ancient philosophies has an all-time relevance about the meaning and goals of life
 kintu yah dharna sarvatha sweekaar karne yogya nahin he
 It can be said broadly that the Dharma, Artha and Kama and Moksha as indicated by the ancient thinkers are still omnipresent
 kintu tathy yah he ki prayek yug or samaaj ukt purusharth ko apane dhang se paribhaashit tathaa vyakhyayit karata he
 Our ancient Smritiks and the pioneers of the Dharmasutras used to have some ideas about social order and the practice of individual life, today those ideas cannot be accepted in their original form
 aaj vibhinn kaaryakshetron main ritairment athwa sena-nivritti kii avasthaa sweekaar kii ja sakati he, sambhavtah puraane yugon main tulaneey niyam nahin the
 At that time, the ideal situation was considered that a person should pass through fifty years and become a vanaprasthi and after this a monk
 aaj jansankhya ke visphot ke yug main dharti par aise sthaan nahin rah gayi hai jahaan vanprastha tathaa sanyas ashramon main pravisht hone vaale jan fal aadi kaa aahaar lete hue jivan-yaapan kar saken
 Thus even today, some followers of Shri Arvind, Maharishi Raman and Gandhiji have been able to live in the ashrams, but in reality, such facilities are not available to everyone
 nishkarsh yah ki itihaas ke badalte maahaul main hamaari jivan sambandhi samasyaon evam manyataon kaa swaroop bhi bahut kuch badal gaya he
 It is important to note that Dr
 Radhakrishnan, the other lecturer of our philosophy and Hindu culture, neither became a monk or a monk in the ancient sense
 darshanik chintan ke upyog ko samajhane kii koshish main prastut lekhak ne yah abhimath prakat kiya he ki darshan kisi samskruti kaa atmavgati he
 We will explain the above recognition by giving two examples
 aaj kaa yug janatantr kaa yug kaha jaataa he
 Under the democracy, almost all citizens have equal rights
 adarsh janatantr main samast nagarikon, visheshtah unki santaanon ko samaan suvidhaayen uplabdh honi chahie
 In these facilities, according to education and qualification, livelihood facilities are main
 duusare, vartmaan yug main jati yaa varg-vishesh ke antargat janm lene ko mahatv nahin diya jaataa
 This is the second thing that the provision of education and work area is considered appropriate to each child according to his natural trends and abilities
 janmana jati kaa siddhanth aaj kisi sabhy samaaj main grahm nahin mana jaataa
 The German dictator Hitler thought that the German people and the Aryan-castes had the birthright to rule other groups
 hitler ne yahudee kahe jane vaale jan-samoohon ko germany se nikaal baahar karne kii peshkash kii
 It is noteworthy that members of the so-called Jewish race have been doing remarkable work in various fields, especially here in history
 udhaaharan ke liye idhar vaigyanik anveshan evam aarthik raajnneetik vyavastha ke sambandh main kai germany vichaarkon ne ullekhneey naye vichaar diye hai
 It is a historical coincidence that certain eminent ideological leaders of the twentieth century were Jews, such as Freud in the field of psychology, Karl Marx in the economic-political field, and Albert Einstein in the field of physics

 Suryavanshi Thakur Meldev Kanouniyas of Talla Gawad voluntarily divided his kingdom into several parts
 jinamein se kuchon ke sakshya spasht hai
 As in his four sons and one daughter

 The first division is to the top son, the southern part of the western side of the Ramganga, the second division is to the northern region of the western side of the Ramganga, the third division is to the third son, the southern part of the state east of the Ramganga, the fourth division

 Esmov carefully considered the problem of what instructions should be given to the robots so that they do not become a threat to humans
 On the basis of this, he gave the principle of three rules of robotics, these are the three rules: any In the event a robot should not be made to harm humans, and if it comes to doing so, it should be disabled: the robot should always be man's command Anne unless they to not interfere in the law: a robot must self-defense as long as it is not contrary to his self-defense first and second terms

 Template: Cardiovascular system manusmriti hindu dharm kaa ek pracheen dharamshastra he
 It is also known by the names Manav dharma-shastra, Manushahita etc
 yah upadesh ke rup main he jo manu dwaara rishiyon ko diya gaya
 Subsequent theologians have followed Manusmriti as a reference
 dharamshastreey granthkaaron ke atirikt shankaracharya, shabaraswami jaise darshanik bhi pramanroopen is granth ko uddhrut karte hai
 Traditionally, this memory is composed by Swayambhuva Manu, not by Vaivasvata Manu or oriental Manu
 manusmriti se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki swyambhuv manu ke mulashastra kaa aashray kar bhrigu ne us smriti kaa upavrihan kiya tha, jo prachlit manusmriti ke naam se prasiddh he
 Like this 'bhargaviya Manusmriti', 'nardiya Manusmriti' is also popular
 manusmriti vah dharamshastra he jisaki manyata jagavikhyath he
 Decisions have been made on the basis of its evidence not only in India but also in foreign countries and even today
 atah dharamshastra ke rup main manusmriti ko vishwa kii amuly nidhi mana jaataa he
 After the Vedas in India, 'manusmriti' is the most recognized and practiced
 isamen chaaron varnon, chaaron ashramon, solah sanskaron tathaa sristi utpatti ke atirikt rajya kii vyavastha, raja ke kartavya, bhaanti-bhaanti ke vivaadon, sena kaa prabandh aadi un sabhi vishyon par paraamarsh diya gaya he jo ki maanav maatr ke jivan main ghatit hone sambhav he
 All this religious system is based on the Veda
 manu maharaj ke jivan or unke rachanakaal ke vishay main itihaas-puraana spasht nahin hai
 However, everyone accepts with one voice that Manu was a primitive man and this scripture is his scripture
 ‘manusmriti’ bhartiya samskruti kaa abhinn ang he
 It is counted in such texts of the world, from which humans have gained inspiration for personal behavior and society
 isamen prashn keval dharmik aasthaa yaa vishwaas kaa nahin he
 Every social person has this expectation and aspiration to meet the needs of human life, in any way, by mutual cooperation and in an elegant way
 videshon main is vishay par paryaapt khoj hui he, tulanaatmak adhyayan hua he or samalochanaayen bhi hui hai
 Its place in Hindu society is after Vedatrayi
 manusmriti ke bahut se sanskaran uplabdh hai
 In time, many interpolations are also natural
 saadhaaran vyakti ke liye yah sambhav nahin he ki vah baad main sammilit hue anshon kii pahchaan kar sake
 Only an official scholar can do this after comparative studies
 antoni read kehete hai ki burma, thailand, cambodia, java-bali aadi main dharamshastron or pramukhtah manusmriti, kaa bada aadar tha
 In these countries, these texts were considered to be natural laws and the kings were expected to conduct themselves accordingly
 in granthon kaa pratilipikaran kiya gaya, anuwaad kiya gaya or sthaneey kanoonon main inako sammilit kar liya gaya
 a book memorial called 'bible in India' Louis Jacquilot writes: manusmriti ke kaal evam praneta ke vishay main naveen anusandhankaree vidwaanon ne paryaapt vichaar kiya he
 Some people believe that this memory was named Manusmriti, because it was active in the "human" stage
 koi kehete hai ki manusmriti se pehle koi 'maanav dharmasutra' tha jiskaa aashray lekar kisi ne ek mul manusmriti banaai thi jo baad main upbrunhit hokar vartmaan rup main prachlit ho gai
 Many answers of Manusmriti are considered even when considering for them many of the ideas or sentences which are not found in ancient texts like Nirukta, Mahabharata etc
 is prakaar ke anek tathyon kaa boohaler, pandurang vaaman kane aadi vidwaanon ne paryaapt vivechan kiya he
 It seems quite logical that the theological sentences with the name of Manu were prevalent in the society, whose instructions are in the Mahabharata etc
 and the words of which the present Manushahita was taken by taking shelter, as well as the name of an ancient sage named Bhrigu for fame
 Added to it
 manu se pehle bhi dharamshastrakaar the, yah manu ke "ete" aadi shabdon se hi gyaat hua he
 Kautilya mentions "manavaah"
 vidwaanon ke anusaar manu parampara kii pracheenta hone par bhi vartmaan manusmriti isa purv chaturth shatabdi se pracheen nahin ho sakati, yah baat yavan, shaq, kamboj, china aadi jatiyon ke nirdesh se gyaat hoti he
 It is also certain that the present form of memory had become strong by the second century BCE and no rites were performed after this period
 manusmriti bhartiya aachaar-samhita kaa vishwakosh he, manusmriti main baarah adhyay tathaa do hajaar paanch sau shloke hai, jinamein sristi kii utpatti, sanskaar, nity or naimitthik karm, ashramadharm, varndharm, rajdharm va praayshchit aadi vishyon kaa ullekh he

 There are many beautiful things in Manusmriti, from personal mindfulness to the whole social system, which can guide us even today
 janm ke aadhaar par jati or varna kii vyavastha par sabase pehali chot manusmriti main hi kii gai he 
 It is also a matter of education for all and to receive the most education

 The king has been told not to force the subjects to do anything
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki praja ko hameshaa nirbhayata mahasoos honi chahie 
 There has been talk of non-violence towards everyone
 manu par kai vyakhyaayein prachlit hai- The names of many commentators of Manu are known, whose commentaries are now extinct, such as - helpless, Bhartriyajna, Yajva, Upadhyaya Riju, Vishnuswamy, Udayakar, Bharuchi or Bhaguri, Bhojdev Dharanidhar etc
 bharat main vedon ke uparant sarvaadhik manyata or prachlan ‘manusmriti’ kaa hi he
 In this, apart from the four varnas, the four ashrams, sixteen rites and the creation of creation, the system of the state, the king's duty, all kinds of disputes, the management of the army, etc
 have been consulted on all those topics which are possible in the life of human beings
 All this religion is based on the Vedas
 manu maharaj ke jivan or unke rachanakaal ke vishay main itihaas-puraana spasht nahin hai
 However, everyone accepts with one voice that Manu was a primitive man and his scripture is Adi Shastra
 kyonki manu kii samast manyataayen satya hone ke saath-saath desh, kaal tathaa jati bandhanon se rahit hai
