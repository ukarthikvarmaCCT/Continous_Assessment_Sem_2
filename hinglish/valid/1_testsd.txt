 To repent of her mistake, Chandra Dev promised Hemvati that she would become the mother of a brave son
 chandradev ne kaha ki vah apane putr ko khajurpura le jaae
 He said that he would become a great king
 raja banane par vah baag or jhiilon se ghire hue anek mandiron kaa nirmaan karavaayega

 chandra ke nirdeshon kaa paalan kar hemavathi ne putr ko janm dene ke liye apana ghar chhod diya or ek chote-se gaanv main putr ko janm diya
 Hemavati's son Chandravarman was as stunning, brave and powerful as his father
 solah saal kii umr main vah bina hathiyaar ke sher yaa baagh ko maar saktaa tha
 Seeing the extraordinary valor of the son, Hemavati worshiped Chandradeva, who presented a stone of paras to Chandravarman and made him king of Khajuraho

 Chandravarman won a spectacular victory in many successive wars

 khajuraho : pattharon par chhaviyaan jivan kii Via one of the motherboards by the host adapter: hard discs drive ek aankadon ko sahej kar surakshit rakhane vaala yantra he, jo digital jaankaree chumbakeey rup se likh or pard saktaa he
 It consists of rotating disks which are coated with magnetic material
 bijli na hone par bhi data bhandaaran yantra aankadon ko surakshit rakhata he
 Data is read randomly from a data storage device
 iskaa matlab he ki aankadon ke samooh ko bhandaaran yantra main kisi bhi jagah likhakar surakshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Meaning there is no need to store data in any particular order
 iskaa avishkaar 1956 main aai0bi0ium0 naamak company main hua tha
 By the 1960s, the data storage device became the most common standby / auxiliary storage device among all common work computers
 aankada bhandaaran yantra main niyamit rup se sudhaar hone laga or aaj sarwar or vyaktigat sanganakon ke jamaane main bhi isane apni jagah sthir rakhi he
 More than 200 industrial units have built data storage devices
 halaanki zyaadaatar data bhandaaran yantra aaj sigate,toshiba or western digital banaate hai
 Data storage equipment revenue worldwide was $ 32 billion in 2013, down 3% from 2012
 data bhandaaran yantra ko uski bhandaaran kshamta or pradarshan ke aadhaar par vishleshit kiya jaataa hai
 Data storage devices have capacity in bytes
 1024 bite ko 1 kilobite kaha jaataa he
 In the same way, 1024 kilobytes is called 1 megabyte
 1024 megabite ko 1 gigabite kehete he or 1024 gigabite ko 1 terabite kaha jaataa he
 The entire storage space of the data storage system is not available to the user as some part is meant to keep the operating system and some part for the file system and some part possibly for internal redundancy fault correction and data recovery
 aankadon ko likhane vaale nok ke patari tak pahunchane ke samay or padhate vaqt vaanchit kshetra ke nok ke neeche tak pahunchane main lagane vaale samay or aankadon ke yantra se avaagaman kii gati ke aadhaar par pradarshan kshamta kaa nirdhaaran kiya jaataa he
 Today's data storage devices are 3
5 inches for computers that can be placed on the table and 2
5 inches for computers that can be placed on a lap
 data bhandaaran yantra mukhya pranali se sata, yuasabi yaa es
e
es jaise maanak vidyut chaalak taron se jude hote hai
 As of 2014, flash memory was the technology to compete as a solid state operator in the field of additional or auxiliary storage
 In the coming times, it is believed that the hard disk will continue its dominance, but where speed and low power consumption are more important, solid state equipment is being used in place of hard disk
 hard discs arthath sakht chakrika sanchaalak ko pehali baar 1956 main ai bi em ke vaastavik samay transction processing computer ke liye data bhandaaran yukti ke rup main pesh kiya gaya tha
 It was also developed for general use, mainframes and use on small computers
 yah pehla ai bi ium drive 350 aar mike do refrigerator ke samaan bada tha or yah 5 million 6 bit aksharon ko rakhane kii kshamta rakhata tha
 It saved the data on a stack of 50 disks
 1962 main ibidam model 1311 ne discs drive laayaa jo washing mashin ke aakaar kaa tha or yah ek hataa sakane vaale discs pack par 20 lakh aksharon ko surakshit rakh saktaa tha
 Users could buy additional packs and interchange them as needed, exactly like magnetic tape reels
 iske baad ke discs pack drivs jo ibidam or duusari companiyon ne banaaye the, computers main istemaal hone lage or 1980 ke dashak tak yah 300 megabite kii kshamta tak pahunch gaye
 hdds that cannot be removed from computers are called "fixed disk" drives
 kuch ucch nishpaadan kshamta vaale achdidi banaaye gaye the jisame prati patari ek nok thi jaise ibidam 2305 taaki nok ko ek patari se duusari patari tak le jane main jo samay vyateet hota he, use bachaaya ja sake
 These were called "fixed heads" or "track on heads" disk drives
 yah bahut manhage the or inhe ab banaaya nahin jaataa
 In 1973, IBM launched a new type of HDD called the "winchester" code
 isamen praathmik taur se khaas baat yah thi kii bijli chale jane par discs head puri tarah se plater se alag nahin hota tha
 Rather it stayed in a particular place of the head disc when the disc stopped moving
 phir se shuru hone par discs head vahi se shuruyaat karata tha
 This proved effective in reducing the expenses of the head promoter system
 vincester praudyogiki ke pehle drivs main hathaaye ja sakane vaale golakaar hisse hote the
 It had a disk pack and a write and read nozzle system
 pravartak motor se jude hue chakke main hi rahata tha
 Subsequent "winchester" drives replaced removable disk packs and used non-removable disk planters
 pehle vincester drivs ke plantres 14 inch ke vyas vaale hua karte the
 After a few years, there was a possibility that if the planters are small then perhaps there may be some more benefits
 8 inch vyas ke plantres vaale drivs aaye or inke baad 5 1 / 4 inch vyas ke plantres vaale drivs bhi aaye
 The 5 1 / 4 inch drives were designed to market the personal computers growing rapidly at the time
 1980 ke dashak ke shuruyaat main HDD bahut manhage the, lekin 1980 ke dashak ke ant tak inke bhav itane kam ho gaye ki sabase saste computaron main bhi inako istemaal kiya jane laga
 In the early 1980s, most hdds were sold as a separate subsystem to the personal computer user
 is up pranali ko drive nirmaataa ke naam se nahin balki up pranali nirmaataa ke naam se bechaa jaataa tha jaise corvas systams, tolgrass technologys yaa to phir nirmaataa ke naam se jaise appal profile
 The IBM PC / XT, launched by IBM in 1983, had a 10-megabyte internal HDD, and since then internal hdds have been used regularly in personal computers
 appal macintosh par bahari achdidi lambe samay tak istemaal kiye jate rahe
 Between 1986 and 1998, every Macintosh computer had a SCSI port on the back to connect external hdds
 2011 ke thailand main aaye baadh ne kai data bhandaaran yantra utpaadak sayantron ko nuksaan pahuchaya tha jisase 2012-2013 ke bich data bhandaaran yantra ke keemton main izaafaa hua tha
 Since the invention of hdds, their air density has steadily increased
 data bhandaaran yantra par ferromegnetic padaarth kii ek patali film hoti he jise aakrisht karke data bhandaaran yantra aankanon ko sahejataa he
 The change of direction of the magnetic field in a sequential manner represents the binary data bits
 chumbakeekaran ke badlaav ko jaanch karke data discs / yantra se padhaa jaataa he
 The data is encoded using a code-writing method
 jaise ran length limited kuta lekhan vidhi
 Which present the data according to the change of magnetic direction
 ek achdidi main takala hota hai jo sapaat gol discs ko pakade rahati hai
 Planters are generally made of non-magnetized materials such as aluminum alloy, glass or ceramic
 in plantres ke upar chumbakeey padaarth kii lep kii jaati hai jo data pakade rahati hai
 The layer of this magnetic material has a thickness of 10 to 20 nanometers and a layer of carbon over it for its protection
 yah chumbakeey padaarth kii parat paper ke motaai se bhi kam hoti hai jo kii 7 xxrep 4 0 se 18 xxrep 4 0 nanometer hoti hai
 Today's hard disk planters are rotated at different speeds, ranging from 4200 rotations per minute in portable devices to 15,000 rpm in high performance capacity servers
 pehla achdidi 1200 arpm kii gati se ghuma tha or kai varsh tak saare achdidi 3600 arpm main ghoomte the
 As of December 2013, most consumer-class hdds run at 5400 rpm or 7200 revolutions per minute
 plater jaise hi read - rhite head ke neeche ghumta hai us samay soochna plater par se padhi jaati hai yaa likhi jaati hai
 Reed - Right head and plotter have very short distances of just a few nanometers
 read - rhite head uske neeche ke chumbakeey padaarth ko padhane or badalane kaa kaam karata hai
 Modern hdds have a reed-right head above each magnetized plotter that is attached to a common arm
 ek gati denevaali bhujaa head ko discs ke ghoomte samay ek vrutt-chaap kii disha main hilaati hai taaki harek head plater ke pure sataha tak pahunch sake
 Voice coil actuators or some earlier designs use stepper motors to move this arm
 drive main jo chumbakeey plate lagi hoti he uske upar prakaashiya tapavarodhan kiya jaataa he
 In earlier hard disk drives, static / same bits were written in seconds, so data was on every track
 lekin aadhunik discs drivs main jone bit recording istemaal karte hai isamen likhane kii raftaar andar se baahar ke trek / patari main jate hue badhati rahati hai isse baahar ke patariyon main zyaada data surakshit rakh sakate hai
 Due to the small size of the magnetic field in modern instruments, it is likely that it can lose its magnetic state due to heat
 garmi ke vajah se hui is chumbakeey asthirataa ko "superperamagnetic limit" bhi kaha jaataa hai
 To avoid this situation, planters are coated with two parallel magnetic layers, between them there is a non-magnetized layer of 3 molecules thickness
 donon parato main vipareet disha main chumbakeey prabhaav hota hai, is prakaar donon parat ek duusare ko sudrudh karte hai
 Another technique used to deal with the effect of heat is called perpendicular recording
 isse recording dencity bhi zyaada milti hai 2005 main ise pehali baar ship kiya gaya tha aaj kai HDD yah takanic istemaal kar rahi hai
 a simple HDD consists of two electric motors
 ek takali se lagi hui motor jo chakrika ko ghumaati hai or ek pravartak motor jo read / rhite head pranali ko ghoomte hue chakrika ke upar le jaataa hai
 The motor connected to the disc has an external rotor that is connected with the disc, the electrical conductor permanent winding wire] installed in one place
 pravartak ke thik vipareet takale se judy chadi ke ant par ek read -rhite head hoti hai
 This write / read nozzle is connected to a very thin electrical circuit with the amplifier electronics located at the focal point of the actuator
 nok kii sahaayak bhujaa vajan main bahut halaki or thos hoti he
 Its speed can be up to 550 g in modern devices
 pravartak ek sthaayee chumbak hota hai
 It has a rotating coil which drives the write / read tip at the right place
 dhaatu kii ek thali ek squat neodiminum -aayran -boron teevr pravaah vaale chumbak ko thame rakhti he
 Beneath this plate is a rotating metal latch, also called a voiced coil
 yah qoil pravartak ke centre se judaa rahata hai or is qoil ke neeche ek neodiminum -aayran -boron chumbak hota he
 It is mounted on a plate at the very bottom of the motor
 awaz vaali qoil kaa aakaar ek tir ke nok ke jaisaa hota hai or ise 2 baar lep kiye hue tambe ke chumbakeey taar se banaaya jaataa hai
 The inside surface is for heat insulation and the outside surface is hot plastic
 nok ke donon taraf ke qoil chumbakeey kshetra ke saath lagate rahete hai
 When the electric current travels in the direction of one metal flanks and in the outer direction of the other flakes, a tangent pressure is produced which rotates the actuator
 HDD ke electronics pravartak ke harakat ko niyantrit karti hai or discs ke parikraman yaa golakaar chalane ko bhi niyantrit karti hai
 She also works for reading or writing information from the disc according to the instructions of the disk controller
 drive electronics kii pratipushti chakrika ke khaas hisson se hoti hai jo sarvo pratipushti ke liye samarpit hota hai
 These are either fully concentric circles or the parts in which the real data are scattered
 ek data bhandaran yantra yaa sakht chakrika sanchaalak main ek yaa ek se zyaada tej ghoomane vaali chakrikaay or chumbakeey nok hote hai
 They are placed on top of a moving actuator arm so that the data can be written or read on the surface of the disc with the help of this tip
 jitna samay chumbakeey nok ko silinder yaa patari main le jane main lage or uske saath hi jo samay chakrika ke hisse ko nok ke neeche ghoomane main lage or kitna data har kshan main preshit ho rahaa hai in maapdando par hi data bhandaran yantra kaa pradarshan nishchit kiya jaataa hai
 Modern data storage devices use error correction codes a lot, especially the read-solomon error prevention code
 yah takanic atirikt bit sahej kar rakhti hai
 Each data block contains a few extra bits that use some math formulas to correct mistakes invisibly
 yah atirikt bits data bhandaran yantra main kuch jagah zarur le lete hai lekin yah data bhandaran yantra par zyaada lekhan ghanatv hona sambhav banaati hai or jo is prakriya main jo galtiyaan aa jaati hai unhen thik karnaa bhi sambhav banaati hai
 The result is that the storage capacity of the data storage device is high
 udhaaharan swaroop ek 1 tibi kshamta vaala data bhandaran yantra jisame 512 bite khand hai vah 93 jibi atirikt data bhandaaran kshamta paata hai
 Small density parity test codes have been replaced by reed-solomon in brand new data storage systems

 menfrem or chote computers ke hard discs alag alag aakaar ke hua karte the
 These were the size of a washing machine or so that they could fit in a 19 inch rack
 ibm ne 1962 main model 1131 discs ko bazaar main utaara
 It used 14-inch discs
 yah kai saalon tak menfrem or chote computer kaa maanak aakaar rahaa
 Such large discs have never been used in microprocessor based systems
 jaise jaise flopy discs drive vaali microprocesar kii bikri badhati gayi apadidi anukulak ke naap kaa ho aise hard discs kii maang bhi bad gayi
 Initially, microcomputer hdds had the same form factories as 8 "inch, 5
25" inch and 3

 It is also used in playstation 3 and Xbox 360 video game systems
 54 mm x 8mm x 78
5 mm yah form factor sabase pehle 1993 main Integral Pehripherals ne laayaa tha
 For some time it was used extensively in digital audio players and subnotebooks
 lekin baad main isaki lokapriyata bahut kam ho gayi or yah form factor market main rer hota ja rahaa hai
 42
8 mm x 5 mm x 36
4 mm This form factor was introduced in 1999 as an IBM microdrive
 yah isliye banaaya gaya tha taaki yah CF Type 2 slot main feet ho sake
 Samsung in its Product Literature describes its same form factor as 1

 Toshiba first announced this form factor in January 2004
 yah form factor mobile phone or duusare chote upkarnon main istemaal kiye jane hetu banaaya gaya tha jisame you es bi se jud sakane vaale achdidi bhi shaamil hai jo kii 4 ji mobile phone par video bhandaaran ke liye bana hota hai
 Toshiba made 4 GB and 8 GB versions

 hdds with 2
5 inch and 3
5 inch form factors are the most popular
 2009 tak hard drive nirmaataao ne 1
3 inch, 1 inch or 0
85 inch form factor vaale HDD kaa nirmaan bandha kar diya hai kyunki yuasabi_flash_drive kii keemte ghat rahi hai or iname ko ghoomane vaala poorja bhi nahin hota
 The time it takes to access data depends on two reasons
 ghoomane vaale chakra kaa yantrik swabhaav
 Rotation speed of tip
 ek HDD kaa ausat abhigam kaal saare sambhav sik time kaa ausat hota hai matlab saare sambhavit sik time ko jitne baar aankanon ko padhne kii koshish hui hai unase bhaag karne par yah sankhya hamen milti hai
 But in practice we get this number from statisticians
 difregmentation ek paddati hai jise istemaal karke aankanon ko padhne main jo vilamb hota hai use kam se kam kiya ja saktaa hai
 In this, the related data are kept in areas close to each other
 kuch computer prachaalan tantra swachaalit tareeke se hi difregmentation karte hai
 The goal of automatic defragmentation is to reduce delays but the performance of hdds slows down for a while while this method is running
 ghoomane kii gati badhaakar yaa sik time kam karke data acces karne kaa samay sudhara ja saktaa hai
 Throughput can be increased by increasing air density, thereby increasing the data rate and the amount of data below the head, which also reduces the seek time
 ausatan sik time hai and sarwar ke hard drivs ke liye 4 ms kaa hota hai, mobile drivs ke liye 15 ms aam mobile drivs ke liye 12 ms or desktop hard drivs ke liye 9 ms kaa hota hai
 First, the hard disk drive had a peak time of 600 ms, by the mid-1970s, hard drives became available with a peak time of 25 ms
 shruwaat ke kuch desktop drivs main heads ko hilaane ke liye stepper motors kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha or iske vajah se sik time 80-120 ms jitna hua karata tha
 But by the 1980s, it started using voice coil type octation, making it faster, reducing the time to 20 ms
 iske baad sik time dhire dhire kam hota rahaa
 They typically store data from 60 GB to 4 TB and rotate at 5400 to 10,000 rotations per minute
 inamen onkanon ki sthanantaran gati 1jibi / second hoti hai
 By August 2014, the highest-capacity desktop HDD could store data up to 8 TB

 Typically, computers used by many consumers on which enterprise software runs are used
 jaise kii: len-dein prasanskaran database, internet kaa aadharbhoot dhaancha, niyar line bhandaaran
 Enterprise hdds generally run 24 hours a day, seven times a day, without any hassle
 yahan atyadhik bhandaaran kshamta paanaa lakshya nahin hota he isliye mulya kii tulana main kshamta kaaphi kaam hoti he
 These are hdds that are mounted in video recorders, MP3 players, vehicles
 chunki ye adhiktar hilte rahane vaale upkarnon main lage hote hai isliye inhe aghat pratirodhi banaaya jaataa he
 This reduces power consumption and increases data storage capacity

 The excellence of Pralaksharas depends very much on the subtlety of the pigments
 tanukaarak ke rup main toluin, jailin or vilaayak naphtha kaa upyog hota he
 These do not dissolve cellulose compounds, only resins and ethyl cellulose, but other cellulose solvents can tolerate them in sufficient amounts
 inke upyog se pralaksharas ke mulya main paryaapt kami ho jaati he
 It is necessary to clean the floor on which the effluent is to be offered

 If there are pits on the floor, they should be filled with supplements and leveled
 keelon or chhedon ko putty se dhank dena chahie lep chadhaane ke pehle kashthatal ko yadi ret ke kaagaj ko ragad len to acha hota he
 Dhatutal should also be cleaned, mustard, filth, grease etc

 tal ko svachh karne ke baad jald hi lep chadhaanaa chahie
 Coating is done in three ways: lep chadhaane ke burush kai prakaar ke milte hai kuch burush vanaspatik reshe ke, kuch jaantab reshe ke banate hai or ab kritrim reshe ke bhi banane lage hai
 The method of plastering with the spray is more extensive

 a coating of both hot or cold conditions can be offered by spray
 phuhaare se konon or kinaaron par bhi lep saralata se chadh jaataa he
 In immersion mode, tanks are necessary to keep the effluent

 kannada bharat ke karnataka rajya main boli janevaali bhashaa tathaa karnataka kii rajbhasha he
 It is one of the 22 languages of India which are included in the Eighth Schedule to the Indian Constitution

 4
50 crore people use Kannada language
 ancarta ke anusaar, vishwa kii sarvaadhik boli jane vaali 30 bhashaaon kii suchi main kannada 27wein sthaan par aati he
 It belongs to the Dravidian language family but it also has many Sanskrit words
 kannada bhashi log isko 'sirigannad' kehete hai
 Kannada language has existed since some 2500 years ago and Kannada script has been in use since 1900 years
 kannada anya dravid bhashaaon kii tarah he or telegu, tamil or malayalam is bhashaa se milali-julati hai
 Kannada is very much influenced by the Sanskrit language and many Sanskrit words are also used in the same sense in Kannada
 bharat sarkaar ne kannada ko bhi bharat kii ek shastreey bhashaa ghoshit kiya he
 There are different views regarding the etymology of the words Kannada and Karnataka
 yadi kisi vidvan kaa yah mat he ki "kanriduanadu" arthath "kaali mitti kaa desh" se kannada shabd bana he to duusare vidvan ke anusaar "kapitu nadu" arthath "sugandhit desh" se "kannadu" or "kannadu" se "kannada" kii vyutpatti hui he
 Kannada literature historian R
K
 Narasimhachar has accepted this view
 kuch vaiyakarnon kaa kathan he ki kannada sanskrit shabd "karnat" kaa tadbhav rup he
 It is also said that "karnayo Atti Iti Karnataka" means that which echoes in the ears is Karnataka
 pracheen granthon main kannada, karnat, karnataka shabd samanarth main prayukt hue hai
 The word Karnat has been used many times in the Mahabharata
 duusari shatabdi main likhe hue tamil "shilappadikaram" naamak kavy main kannada bhashaa bolanewaalon kaa naam "karunader" bataaya gaya he
 In the texts of Varahamihira's Brihatsamhita, Somadeva's Kathasaritsagara, Gunadhya's Paisachi "brihatkatha", etc
, there is an equal mention of the word Karnat
 'karnataka' shabd angreji main vikrut hokar karnatik athwa kenra, phir kenra se kenariz ban gaya he
 Kanadi, Kannadi, Canara, Canari are used for the word Kannada in Hindi and other languages of northern India
 aajkal karnataka tathaa kannada shabdon kaa nishchit arth main prayog hota he – karnataka pradesh kaa naam he or "kannada" bhashaa kaa
 The languages of the Dravidian language family are called Panchadravid languages
 kisi samay in panchadravid bhashaaon main kannada, tamil, telegu, gujarati tathaa marathi bhashaayen sammilit thim
 But nowadays Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Tulu are considered under Panchdravidian languages
 vastut: tulu kannada kii hi ek pusht boli he jo dakshin kannada jile main boli jaati he
 Apart from Tulu, there are other dialects of Kannada - Kodagu, Tod, Kot and Badag
 kodagu kurg main boli jaati he or baaki teenon kaa nilgiri jile main prachlan he
 Nilgiri district is under the state of Tamil Nadu
 ramayana-mahabharat-kaal main bhi kannada boli jaati thi, to bhi isa ke purv kannada kaa koi likhit rup nahin miltaa
 The written form of early Kannada is found in inscriptions
 in shilalekhon main halmidi naamak sthaan se praapt shilaalekh sabase pracheen he, jiskaa rachanakaal 450 i
 he
 The inscriptions of Badami and Shravan Belagol are important among the inscriptions written in the seventh century
 praaia: aathvin shatabdi ke purv ke shilalekhon main gadhy kaa hi prayog hua he or uske baad ke shilalekhon main kavyalakshanon se yukt padya ke uttam namoonay praapt hote hai
 Where the language of these inscriptions is well-formed and mature, there is a strong influence of Sanskrit on it
 is prakaar yadhyapi aathvi shatabdi tak ke shilalekhon ke aadhaar par kannada main gadhy-padya-rachana kaa pramaan miltaa he to bhi kannada ke uplabdh sarvapratham granth kaa naam "kavirajmarg" ke uparaant kannada main granthanirmaan kaa kaary uttarottar badha or bhashaa nirantar viksit hoti gai
 Four stages of development of Kannada language have been considered which are as follows: chaaron dravid bhashaaon kii apni pruthak-pruthak lipiyaan hai

 According to Krishna, these four scripts have evolved from the southern branch of the ancient part-time Brahmi script
 banaavat kii drushti se kannada or telegu main tathaa tamil or malayalam main samya he
 Based on Telugu inscriptions written before the 13th century, it is reported that in ancient times Telugu and Kannada scripts were the same
 vartmaan kannada kii lipi banaavat kii drushti se devanagari lipi se bhinn dikhaai detii hai, kintu donon ke dhvanisamooh main adhik antar nahin he
 The difference is that in Kannada, the vowel "l" as well as the vowel "l" are found under the vowel form and consonants of "a" and "o" under vowels
 pracheen kannada main "r" or "l" prayek ke ek-ek murdhanya rup kaa prachlan tha, kintu aadhunik kannada main in donon varno kaa prayog lupt ho gaya he
 The rest of the sound group is similar to Sanskrit
 kannada kii varnmaala main kul 47 varna hai
 Nowadays their number has been increased to fifty-two
 goswami tulsidas hindi sahitya ke mahaan kavi the
 He was born in Soron Shukrakshetra, present-day Kasganj Uttar Pradesh
 kuch vidvan aapkaa janm rajapur jila baandaa main hua maanate hai
 He is also considered an incarnation of Maharishi Valmiki, the author of the Adi Kavya Ramayana
 shriramcharitamanas kaa kathanak ramayana se liya gaya he
 Ramcharitmanas is a folk book and it is read with great devotion in North India
 iske baad vinay patrika unka ek anya mahatvapurn kavy he
 The epic Sriramacharitamanas was ranked 46th among the world's 100 best popular poetry
 adhikansh vidwaan tulsidas kaa janm sthaan rajapur ko maanane ke paksh main hai
 Although some also consider it as the Soro Sukkshetra
 rajapur uttar pradesh ke chitrakoot jila ke antargat sthit ek gaanv he
 There lived an eminent Sarauparin Brahmin named Atmaram Dubey
 unki dharmapatni kaa naam hulsi tha
 Tulsidas was born here in the same nakshatra moola nakshatra on the seventh day of the bright fortnight of Shravan month of Samvat 1511
 prachlit janashruti ke anusaar shishu baarah maheene tak maan ke garbh main rahane ke kaaran atyadhik hrisht pusht tha or uske mukh main daant dikhaayi de rahe the
 As soon as he was born, he pronounced the name Rama, which gave him the name Rambola
 unke janm ke duusare hi din maan kaa nidhan ho gaya
 The father handed over the child to a maid named Chuniya to avoid any further evils and disabused himself
 jab rambola saade paanch varsh kaa hua to chuniyaan bhi nahin rahi
 He was forced to live like an orphan wandering the streets
 bhagwaan shankaraji kii prerana se ramshail par rahanevaale shri anantanand ji ke priy shishy srinaraharyanand ji ne is rambola ke naam se bahucharchit ho chuke is balak ko dhund nikaala or vidhivat uskaa naam tulsiram rakhaa
 Thereafter, he took him to Ayodhya and performed his yagyopavit-sanskar there in 1561 Magh Shukla Panchami
 sanskaar ke samay bhi bina sikhaaye hi balak rambola ne gayatri-mantra kaa spashth uccharan kiya, jise dekhakar sab log chakit ho gayi
 After this, Narhari Baba, after performing the five rites of Vaishnavas, gave the child the initiation of Ram-mantra and made him study while staying in Ayodhya
 balak rambola kii buddhi badi prakhar thi
 What he would hear from Guru-mukha in one go, he would become memorized
 vahaan se kuch kaal ke baad guru-shishy donon shukarakshetra pahunche
 There Narhari Baba narrated the story of Rama to the child but he did not understand it well
 jyeshtha shukla trayodashi, guuruuvaar, sanwat 1583 ko 29 varsh kii aayu main rajapur se thodi hi dur yamuna ke us paar sthit ek gaanv kii ati sundari bharadwaj gotra kii kanya ratnavali ke saath unka vivaah hua
 Since Gauna was not done, he went to Kashi for some time and stayed there with Seshasanatan ji and started studying ved-vedang
 vahaan rahete hue achaanak ek din unhen apni patni kii yaad aayi or ve vyakul hone lage
 When he was no more, he returned to his birthplace Rajapur with permission from Guruji
 patni ratnavali chunki maayke main hi thi kyonki tab tak unka gauna nahin hua tha at: tulsiram ne bhayankar andheri raat main ufanti yamuna nadi tairkar paar kii or sidhe apni patni ke shayan-kaksh main ja pahunche
 Ratnavali was surprised to see her husband alone that night
 usne lok-lajja ke bhay se jab unhen chupchaap waapas jane ko kaha to ve usase usee samay ghar chalane kaa aagrah karne lage
 Fearing his unexpected stubbornness, Ratnavali taught him through a couplet composed by Tulsiram, which made him Tulsidas
 ratnavali ne jo doha kaha tha vah is prakaar he: Hearing this couplet, he left his wife's house there at the same time and returned back to his village Rajapur
 rajapur main apane ghar jaakar jab unhen yah pataa chalaa ki unki anupasthiti main unke pita bhi nahin rahe or puraa ghar nasht ho chukaa he to unhen or bhi adhik ksht hua
 He paid obeisance to his father lawfully and started living in the village and narrating the story of Lord Rama to the people
 kuch kaal rajapur rahane ke baad ve pun: kaashi chale gayi or vahaan kii janata ko ram-katha sunaane lage
 During the story, he found a phantom in the guise of a man, who told him the address of Hanumanji
 hanuman ji se milakar tulsidas ne unase raghunathji kaa darshan karaane kii prarthana kii
 Hanumanji said- "you will see Raghunathji in Chitrakoot
 " is par tulsidas ji chitrakoot kii ore chal pade
 After reaching Chitrakoot, he set his posture at Ramghat
 ek din ve pradakshina karne nikle hi the ki yakaayak maarg main unhen shriram ke darshan hue
 He saw that two very handsome princes were riding on horses and carrying bows and arrows
 tulsidas unhen dekhakar aakarshith to hue, parantu unhen pahchaan na sake
 Then when Hanumanji came from behind and told him the whole secret, he started to repent
 is par hanumanji ne unhen satvana di or kaha praatavkaal phir darshan honge
 Lord Shri Ram reappeared in front of them on Wednesday on the Mauni Amavasya of Samvat 1607
 unhone balak rup main aakar tulsidas se kaha-"baba! hamen chandan chaiye kya aap hamen chandan de sakate hai?" hanuman ji ne sochaa, kahin ve is baar bhi dhokhaa na kha jaayen, isaliye unhone tote kaa rup dhaaran karke yah doha kaha: Seeing that wonderful image of Tulsidas Shri Ram, he forgot his own mind and mind
 antatogatva bhagwaan ne swayan apane haath se chandan lekar apane tathaa tulsidas ji ke mastak par lagaaya or antardhyaan ho gayi
 In Samvat 1628, he took Hanuman's orders and proceeded towards Ayodhya
 un dinon prayag main magh mela laga hua tha
 They stayed there for a few days
 parv ke chah din baad ek vatvriksh ke neeche unhen bharadwaj or yajyavlky muni ke darshan hue
 There had been the same story, which he had heard from his master in Sukrkshetr
 magh mela samaapt hote hi tulsidas ji prayag se pun: waapas kaashi aa gayi or vahaan ke prahladghaat par ek brahman ke ghar nivas kiya
 While living there, poetry-power emerged in him and he started writing poetry in Sanskrit
 parantu din main ve jitne padya rachate, raatri main ve sab lupt ho jate
 This incident happens every day
 aathven din tulsidas ji ko swapn hua
 Lord Shankar ordered them to compose poetry in their own language
 tulsidas ji kii neend uchat gayi
 He got up and sat down
 usee samay bhagwaan shiv or parvati unke saamne prakat hue
 Tulsidas ji prostrated him
 is par prasann hokar shiv ji ne kaha- "tum ayodhya main jaakar raho or hindi main kavy-rachana karo
 With my blessings, your poem will flourish like Samveda
 " itnaa kahkar gaurishankar antardhan ho gayi
 Tulsidas ji, following his orders, went straight from Kashi to Ayodhya
 sanwat 1631 kaa prarambh hua
 In that year yoga came on the day of Ram Navami in the same way as it was on the day of Rama's birth in Tretayuga
 us din praatavkaal tulsidas ji ne shriramcharitamanas kii rachana prarambh kii
 This wonderful book was completed in two years, seven months and twenty six days
 sanwat 1633 ke margshirsh shuklapaksh main ram-vivaah ke din saaton kand purna ho gayi
 After this, Tulsidas came to Kashi by the command of God
 vahaan unhone bhagavan vishwanath or mata annapurna ko shriramcharitamanas sunaaya
 At night the book was kept in the vishwanath-mandir
 praat:kaal jab mandir ke pat khole gayi to pustak par likhaa hua paaya gaya-satyam shivan sundaram jiske neeche bhagavan shankar kii sahi thi
 At that time, the people present there also heard the voice of "satya Shivam Sundaram" with their ears
 idhar kaashi ke panditon ko jab yah baat pataa chali to unke man main irshyaa utpann hui
 They started making a team and condemned Tulsidas ji and tried to destroy that book
 unhone pustak churaane ke liye do chor bhi bheje
 The thieves went and saw that two youths were guarding the bow with a bow around the Tulsidas ji's hut
 donon yuvak bade hi sundar kramash: shyaam or gaur varna ke the
 As soon as they saw him, the thieves' intelligence became pure
 unhone usee samay se chori karnaa chhod diya or bhagwaan ke bhajan main lag gayi
 Tulsidas ji looted all the things of his life and suffering for God, and kept the book with his friend Todarmal
 iske baad unhone apni vilakshan samaran shakti se ek duusari prati likhi
 On the basis of this, other copies were prepared and the promotion of the book started increasing day by day
 idhar kaashi ke panditon ne or koi upaay na dekh shri madhusudan saraswati naam ke mahapandit ko us pustak ko dekhakar apni sammati dene kii prarthana kii
 Madhusudan Saraswati ji was very happy to see him and wrote his comment on it - iskaa hindi main arth is prakaar he-"kaashi ke anand-van main tulsidas saakshaat chalata-phirata tulsi kaa paudha he
 His poetry is very beautiful, on which the temple of Shriram always hovers
 " The Pandits were also not satisfied with his comment
 tab pustak kii pariksha kaa ek anya upaay sochaa gaya
 In the Vishwanath-temple of Kashi, the Vedas were placed at the top in front of Lord Vishwanath, the scriptures under them, the Puranas under the scriptures and the Ramcharitmanas under them
 praatavkaal jab mandir kholaa gaya to logon ne dekha ki shriramcharitamanas vedon ke upar rakhaa hua he
 Now all the priests were very ashamed
 unhone tulsidas ji se kshamaa maangi or bhakthi-bhav se unka charanodak liya
 When Tulsidas ji started living on the famous ghat Aseighat of Kashi, one night Kali Yuga came to him in physical form and started tormenting him
 tulsidas ji ne usee samay hanuman ji kaa dhyaan kiya
 Hanuman ji appeared visually and asked him to create a prayer post, after which he wrote his last work Vinaya Patrika and dedicated it to the feet of God
 shriram ji ne us par swayan apane hastakshar kar diye or tulsidas ji ko nirbhay kar diya
 Shravana Krishna Tritiya on Saturday in 1680, Tulsidas ji gave up his body, saying "ram-ram"
 tulsidas ji kii hastlipi atyadhik sundar thi lagata he jaise us yug main unhone calography kii kala aati thi
 a copy of the Ayodhyakanda of Sriramcharitmanas is preserved in a temple of his birthplace, Rajapur
 usee prati ke saath rakhe hue ek kavi madanlaal verma 'krant' kii hastlipi main tulsi ke vyaktitv va krititv ko rekhaankit karte hue nimnlikhit do chand bhi ullekhneey hai jinhen hindi academy dilli kii patrika indraprastha bharti ne sarvapratham prakashit kiya tha
 The first verse in these is the overview, which is the feature that each step begins with the word that ends with it
 pratham va antim shabd bhi ek hi rahata he
 It has been called a wonderful verse in poetry
 yahi chand ek anya patrika sahityaparikrama ke tulsi jainti visheshank main bhi prakashit hue the vahiin se uddhrut kiye gayi hai In his long life span of 126 years, Tulsidas composed the following classics in chronological order - inamen se ramcharitamanas, vinay-patrika, kavitawali, gitavali jaisi kritiyon ke vishay main kisi kavi kii yah arshvani sateek prathit hoti he - pashy devsy kavyan, na mrinoti na jiryati
 That is, see the poetry of devpurus, which does not die or become old
 lagbhag chaar sau varsh purv tulsidas ji ne apni kritiyon kii rachana kii thi
 Even in that period devoid of modern publishing facilities, Tulsidas's poetry had reached the masses
 yah unke kavi rup main lokapriy hone kaa pratyaksh pramaan he
 By reading a large book like Manas, the normal educated people were also becoming famous for their purity and knowledge
 ramcharitamanas tulsidas ji kaa sarvaadhik lokapriy granth rahaa he
 He has not mentioned anything in relation to his works, hence there is a lack of in-depth evidence regarding authentic works
 nagari prachaarini sabha kaashi dwaara prakashit granth is prakaar hai : Grierson also mentions the first twelve texts above in the Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics
 yah sanskaar geet he
 Certain references in this song are different from the story of ram-vivah
 vairaygy sandipani ko mataprasad gupt ne apramanik mana he, par acharya chandravali pandey ise pramanik or tulsi kii aarambhik rachana maanate hai
 Solid evidence can be found by the availability of some more ancient copies
 sant mahima varnan kaa pehla soratha pesh he - Scholars have declared it a creation of Tulsi
 style kii drushti se yah tulsidas kii pramanik rachana he
 Only a fragmented copy of it is edited in the bibliography
 yah tulsi kii pramanik rachana prathit hoti he
 Its poetic maturity is compatible with the Tulsi theory
 kavita saral, subodh rochak or saras he
 "" Jagat Matu Pitu Sambhu Bhavani "" is not even a little bit of the aesthetic efforts
 lok reeti itani yathasthiti se chitrit hui he ki yah sanskrit ke shiv kavy se kam prabhavit he or tulsi kii mati kii bhaktyaatmak bhoomika par virachit katha kavy he
 The poet has carefully noted the solidity of behaviors, the exclusivity of love, and the plausibility of the matrimonial program
 tulsidas apni is rachana se atyant santusht the, isiilie is anasakt bhakt ne keval ek baar apni mati kii saraahna kii he - Scholars have placed it in the authentic compositions of Tulsidas
 par isamen bhi kshepak he
 Before the Tulsi Manas, the story of Valmiki Ramayana was popular
 kaashi ke panditon se maanas ko lekar tulsidas kaa matbhed or maanas kii prati par vishwanath kaa hastakshar sambandhi janashruti prasiddh he
 This astrology is the scripture of the classical method
 dohon, saptakon or sargon main vibhakt yah granth ramakatha ke vividh mangal evam amangalamay prasangon kii mishrit rachana he
 In terms of poetry, the importance of this book is negligible
 sabhi ise tulsikrut maanate hai
 It lacks a story-series and the translations of the Valmiki Ramayana are translated into several couplets
 dohavali main adhikansh dohe maanas ke hai
 The poet has written devotions and love by writing a long series of couplets from the Vyasa of Chatak
 dohavali doha sankalan he
 Some non-fiction couplets of Manas also have a place in it
 sambhav he kuch dohe isamen bhi prakshipt hon, par rachana kii apramanikta asandigdh he
 Kavitavali is a work of Tulsidas, but this composition published in the Sabha edition or other editions does not seem complete
 kavitawali ek prabandh rachana he
 Irrelevance and laxity in the plot will be called the stigma of Tulsi's art
 gitavali main geeton kaa aadhaar vividh cond kaa ramcharita hi rahaa he
 This book seems to have been reduced to widespread public relations like Ramcharitmanas
 isliye in geeton main parivartan-parivardhan drushtigat nahin hota he
 The narrative-references to the songs in Gitavali are in line with Tulsi's mati
 is drushti se gitavali kaa ek geet liya ja saktaa he - In this, Tulsidas has expressed the exaltation of the modesty of Bharata and Rama
 gitavali ke uttarkand main maanas kii katha se adhik vistaar he
 In this, Sita is sent to Valmiki Ashram
 is parityag kaa auchity nirdesh in panktiyon main miltaa he - Shri Krishna Geetwali is also the creation of Goswamiji
 shrikrishna-katha ke katipay prakaran geeton ke vishay hai
 This is a Hanuman-devotional work of Goswami Ji
 par yah ek swatantra rachana he
 All parts of it seem authentic
 tulsidas ko ram pyaare the, ram kii katha pyaari thi, ram kaa rup pyaara tha or ram kaa swaroop pyaara tha
 Rama's dignity and lila were dominated by his intellect, raga, imagination and sentimentality
 unak ankhon main ram kii chhavi basati thi
 Everything is expressed in Rama's holy leela, the highest achievement in the tradition of Ramkavya

 jal or alcohol main yah purna mishray hota he, par ether main aviley
 With the hydroxides of alkalis and metals it forms glycerate and esters with acids
 tel or vasa glissrin or vasa-amlon ke aster hai
 Along with nitric acid, it forms an ester of nitric acid, which has been given the impure name nitro-glycerin
 vastut: yah nitro yogic nahin he
 Nitro-glycerin is a compound of great importance
 yah badi maatra main visphotakon ke nirmaan main prayukt hota he
 The majority of glycerin is consumed in this
 thodi maatra main nitro-glissrin aushadhiyon or vishanirmaan main bhi prayukt hota he
 One feature of glycerin is its non-drying
 jis padaarth main yah daalaa jaataa he, vah vaayu main sadaa bhigaa hi rahata he
 For this reason, it is used in making shoes and fountain pens, duplicators, stamps and printing ink and plastic etc
 khaadya samagriyon or peyon ke sangrakshan main bhi glissrin bahumoolya siddh hua he

 chemical compounds of carbon are called carbonic compounds
 prakruti main inaki sankhya 10 lakh se bhi adhik he
 Organic compounds have a very important role in life
 inamen carbon ke saath-saath hydrogen bhi rahata he
 Due to historical and tradition reasons, some carbon compounds are not classified as organic compounds
 inamen carbondioxide, carbon monooxide pramukh hai
 All biomolecules such as carbohydrates, amino acids, proteins, RNA and DNA are organic compounds
 carbon or hydrogen ke yogico ko hydrocarbon kehete hai
 Methane is the hydrocarbon of the smallest molecule
 ethane, propen aadi iske baad aate hai, jinamein kramash: ek ek carbon judata jaataa he
 Hydrocarbons can be divided into three categories: ethane category, ethylene class and acetylene class
 ethane shrenee ke hydrocarbon santrupt hai, arthath inamen hydrogen kii maatra or badhaai nahin ja sakati
 Ethylene has a double bond between two carbons, in acetylene the triple bonded compounds are temporary
 ye aasaani se oxikrut evam hellojanikrut ho sakate hai
 Many derivatives of hydrocarbons can be prepared, which have diverse uses
 aise vyutpann chloride, bromide, iodide, alcohal, sodium alcoxide, amin, maracaptain, nitrate, nitrite, nitrite, hydrogen phosphate tathaa hydrogen sulphate hai
 Unsaturated hydrocarbons are more active and combine with many reactants to form a readily derived derivative
 aise anek vyutpan audyogic drushti se bade mahatv ke siddh hue hai
 Many valuable solvents, plastics, anthelmintic drugs etc
 have been obtained from them
 hydrocarbonon ke oxikaran se alcodaul ether, kitone, aldihide, vasa amla, aster aadi praapt hote hai
 Alcohol can be primary, secondary and tertiary
 inke aster drav sugandhit hote hai
 Many scented liquids can be prepared from them
 isi prakaar glicrin ko bhi vibhinn prayogon main liya ja saktaa he
