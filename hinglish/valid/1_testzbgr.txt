 vayumandal kii ardrata naapane ke sadhano ko ardrathamapi kehete hai
 There are many substances, such as sulfuric acid, calcium chloride, phosphorus pentaoxide, common salt, etc
, which are absorbent of water vapor
 inkaa upyog karke rasinic ardathamapi banaae jate hai, jinke dwaara vaayu ke ek nishchit aaytan main vidyaman jalawaashp kii maatra gram main gyaat kii jaati he
 Weigh in a bottle by filling phosphorus pentaoxide and calcium chloride in two or three tubes
 phir is bottle ko ek vayuchooshak kii shrunkhlaa main jod dete hai
 When the sucker is turned on, the water falls and the air enters the empty space through the bottle and the tubes
 purvokt rasinic padaarth vaayu ke jalawaashp ko sokh lete hai or sukhi vaayu chooshak main ekatra ho jaati he
 Bottles and taps are then weighed with chemical substances
 pehali taul ko isamen se ghataakar jalawaashp kii maatra, jo ekatrit vaayu ke bheetar thi, gyaat ho jaati he
 Humidity can be detected with such precision with such a device, but it takes time to get results
 anya ardrathamapi dine, danniel yaa reno ke naam se prasiddh hai
 Through them we find the dew point
 phir is osank or vaayu ke taap par vashpadaab kaa maan, reno kii sarini dekhakar, aapekshik ardrata gyaat kar sakate hai
 In addition to this, wet and dry bulb hygrometer has been constructed for instantaneous knowledge of moisture in the air
 ise cicrometer bhi kehete hai
 In this device, two identical thermometers are mounted on the same board
 ek tapamapi ke balb par kapadaa lapeta rahata he, jo sadaa bhigaa rahata he
 For this, one end of the cloth is immersed in the water of the pot kept below
 kapade ke jal kaa vashpibhawan rahata he, jo vaayu kii ardrata par nirbhar rahata he
 When there is a lack of moisture in the air, the evaporation is more and its main part is a hair, which fluctuates according to the maximum humidity
 jab vaayu main nami kii adhikta hoti he to vashpibhawan kam hota he
 According to evaporation, the mercury of a wet-bulb thermometer comes down and a difference is found in the lessons of the two thermometers
 unke paathon main yah antar vaayu kii nami kii maatra par nirbhar rahata he
 If the air is saturated with water vapor, the text of the two thermometers remains the same
 reno kii sarini main vibhinn tapon par is antar ke anukool jalawaashp kii daab di hui he, at: donon tapamapiyon kaa paath lekar aapekshik ardrata tathaa osank kaa maan gyaat kiya jaataa he
 With the aim of changing the air on the thermometers, it is organized to rotate some cyclometers at a speed
 takhti motor dwaara prati second chaar baar ghumaai jaati he, jisase vaayu sadaa badalati rahati he
 The relative humidity table for such cyclometers is adapted to the corresponding revision number 4
 paribhraman sepaare kii sataha hilti rahati he
 Other remedies have been used to correct this defect and for pure measurement
 ek prakaar ke yantra main donon tapamapiyon ko dhaatu kii dohari nalee ke bheetar sthir rakhaa jaataa he or nalee ke bheetar kii hawa ek chote bijli ke pankhe dwaara badalati rahati he
 The radiation from such a double wall tube is also not affected
 kintu uparokt ardrathamapiyon se ardrata kaa maan sheeghra nahin gyaat kiya ja saktaa
 Apart from this, the amount of moisture in the air varies from moment to moment and we need to know the moisture every minute throughout the day
 purvokt yantron dwaara ham vayumandal ke upree bhaag kii ardrata kaa adhyayan bhi nahin kar sakate
 In order to accomplish these purposes, de Sosseur first created a hygroscope, looking at the effect of moisture on hair length
 is ardratadarshak main ek ruukhaa svachh bal rahata he
 One end of the hair is held in a fine piece of metal by a screw
 neeche kii ore bal kaa ek pheraa ek ghirani par lapet diya jaataa he
 The end of the hair is then fastened by a screw to the pulley
 ghirani kii dhuree par ek sanketak laga rahata he
 When the length of the hair is increased, due to a segregation, the pulley rotates on one side and decreases on the other side and with it the indicator moves on a circular scale
 maapni kaa anshankan ardrathaman main kiya rahata he, at: sanketak ke sthaan se maapni par ardrata kaa maan pratishat turant padhaa ja saktaa he
 Based on this, self-written hygrometers have been created, by which the value of humidity of 24 hours or every moment of the whole week is written on the graph
 kintu ek bal se itani pushtataa nahin aati ki ghirani ke sanketak se graph likhvaya ja sake, visheshkar jab aisa upkaran gubaare athwa vimaan main upree vayumandal ke adhyayan ke liye lagaaya jaataa he
 a bunch of hair or rope is used for confirmation
 parantu isse ardrathamapi kii yatharthata ghat jaati he
 It has been observed that one hair of horse is more useful than rope of human hair
 isliye inkaa prayog kiya jaataa he, parantu ek anya dosha ke kaaran sheet pradeshon main iskaa upyog nahin ho saktaa
 Due to the decrease in temperature, the hair's attrition towards water vapor is reduced
 tab upkaran bahut samay ke baad nami se prabhavit hota he
 -40 ° c But the hair becomes very frustrated
 ab kuch aise vidyut chaalak padaarthon kaa pataa chalaa he jinke vaidyut avrodh main jalawaashp ke kaaran parivartan hota he
 Dunmore has designed such a thermometer to study the upper atmosphere
 isamen lithium fluoride kii patali parat hoti he jiskaa vaidyut avrodh jalawaashp ke kaaran badalata he
 This layer remains in the electrodeath
 avrodh ke parivartan se dhara ghatati badhati he, at: dharamapi kii maapni par ardrathaman padhaa ja saktaa he
 The humidity value can also be plotted on the graph by making the indicator of the thermometer as self-writing
 gubaare or vayuyanon main praaia: aise hi ardrathamapi lage rahete hai

 It is divided over 400 years and equals 20871 weeks
 in 400 varshon main 303 varsh aam varsh hote hai, jiname 365 din hote hai
 And there are 97 leap years, consisting of 366 days
 is prakaar har varsh main 365 din, 5 ghante, 49 minute or 12 second hote he
 In the Julian calendar, 365 days was considered a 6-hour year, but assuming it takes 11 minutes 14 seconds more than a revolutionary solar year each year

 Pope Gregory of Rome first considered this mistake subtly
 unhone isvi san 1582 main hisaab lagaakar dekha ki naaise nagar ke dharm-sammelan ke samay se, jo isvi san 325 main hua tha, purvokt aadhiky 10 din kaa ho gaya he, jisko gananaa main nahin lene ke kaaran taarikh 10 din peeche chal rahi thi
 With this idea, he decided the 15th of October in 1582 AD in consultation with the astrologer Allay Sius Lilius of Naples, and since then took the rule that the century, if divided completely by 400, instead of being completely divided by year 4 It should be considered as leap year or not

 This new method was adopted by Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal in 1582, Prussia, the Roman Catholic Territories of Germany, Switzerland and Flanders in 1583, Poland in 1586, Hungary in 1587, Protestants from Germany and the Netherlands
 Territory and Denmark in 1700, British Empire in 1752, Japan in 1972, China in 1912, Bulgaria in 1915, Turkey and Soviet Russia in 1917 and Yugoslavia and Su Romania adopted in 1919 AD
 1582 isvi ke baad 1700 i0 main 28 farvari tak puraane calendar se naye calendar kii taarikh main 10 din kii hi vruddhi rahi
 Since 1600 AD was a century, it was completely divided by 400, so it would have been a leap year by the new method
 atah usamen taarikh main antar karne hetu 1 din kii vruddhi nahin hui
 This means that changing the date from the old calendar to the new calendar will be progressively increased from the aforesaid 10 days to one day in the same century years in which the 400 years do not completely participate
 arthath 1700 isvi kii 28 farvari ke baad naye calendar kii taarikh banane ke liye 10 din kii jagah 11 din jode jaayenge
 Similarly, 12 days will be added after 28 February of 1800 AD and 13 days after 28 February of 1900 AD

 He was born in Lumbini near Kapilavastu

 Siddhartha's father was Shuddhodana, the king of the Shakyas
 paramparaagat katha ke anusaar, siddharth kii mata mahamaya unke janm ke kuch der baad mar gayi thi
 It is said that 8 sages were invited to name him, all told 2 possibilities, they will become a great king, they will become a monk or parivrajaka
 is bhavishya vaani ko sunakar raja shuddhodan ne apni yogyata kii had tak siddharth ko sadhu na banane dene kii bahut koshishen kii
 The Shakyas had their own union
 bees varsh kii aayu hone par har shakya tarun ko shakyasang main dikshit hokar sangh kaa sadsy bananaa hota tha
 When Siddhartha Gautam was twenty years old, he too joined the membership of Shakyasangh and according to the rules of Shakya Sangha, Siddhartha had spent eight years as a member of Shakya Sangha
 ve sangh ke atyant samarpit or pakke sadsy the
 He was very interested in the affairs of the Union
 sangh ke sadsy ke rup main unka aacharan ek udhaaharan tha or unhone swayan ko sabakaa priy bana liya tha
 In the eighth year of the membership of the Sangh, an incident occurred which became tragic for Shuddhodan's family and a critical situation was created in the life of Siddhartha
 shaakyon ke rajya kii seemaa se sata hua coliyon kaa rajya tha
 The Rohini River was the dividing line of the two states
 shakya or coliya donon hi rohinee nadi ke pani se apane-apane khet sinchate the
 They used to dispute between each crop on who would use Rohini's water first and how much
 ye vivaad kabhi-kabhi jhagade or ladaaiyon main badal jate the
 When Siddhartha was 28 years old, there was a fight between Shakya and the servants of Kolis over Rohini's water, injuring people on both sides
 jhagade kaa pataa chalane par shaakyon or coliyon ne sochaa ki kyon na is vivaad ko yuddh dwaara hameshaa ke liye hal kar liya jaye
 The commander of the Sakyas called a session of the Shakya Sangha to consider the question of declaration of war against the Kolis and proposed war to the Union
 siddharth gautam ne is prastaav kaa virodh kiya or kaha yuddh kisi prashn kaa samaadhaan nahin hota, yuddh se kisi uddeshy kii purti nahin hogi, isse ek duusare yuddh kaa bijaropan hoga
 Siddharth said that i propose that we choose two men from among us and ask the Kolis to choose two men
 phir ye chaaron milakar ek paanchavaa aadmi chune
 These five men together solve the quarrel
 siddharth kaa prastaav bahumat se amaanya ho gaya saath hi shakya senapati kaa yuddh kaa prastaav baari bahumat se paarit ho gaya
 Unable to resolve the dispute with Shakya Sangha and Shakya Senapati, Siddharth eventually had three options
 teen vikalpon main se unhen ek vikalp chunanaa tha sena main bhartee hokar yuddh main bhaag lenaa, apane parivaar ke logon kaa saamaajik bahishkaar or unke kheton kii jabti ke liye raji hona, phaansi par latakana yaa desh nikaala sweekaar karnaa
 He opted for the third option and agreed to leave the country as a transcendent
 parivrajak banakar sarvapratham siddharth ne paanch brahmanon ke saath apane prashnon ke uttar dhundne shuru kiye
 He was able to get proper attention, but he did not get answers to his questions

 Even in this work, he became more proficient than his teachers, but he could not find answers to his questions yet
 fir unhone kuch saathi ikaithe kiye or chal diye adhik kathor tapasya karne
 Doing so, after six years, without getting answers to their questions, having passed through death due to hunger, they started thinking of doing something else
 is samay, unhen apane bachapan kaa ek pal yaad aayaa, jab unke pita khet taiyaar karnaa shuru kar rahe the
 At that time, he had fallen into a blissful meditation and he felt as if time had come to a standstill
 kathor tapasya chhodkar unhone ashtangik maarg dhund nikaala, jo bich kaa maarg bhi kehalaata jaataa he kyonki yah maarg dono tapasya or asanyam kii paraakaashthaon ke bich main he
 To infuse some power into his body, he took some milk from a goat

 Gautama Buddha used to say that to follow the truth of the Four Noble Truths, one should follow this path: 1
 samyak drushti : chaar arya satya main vishwaas karnaa 2
 samyak sankalp : maansik or naitik vikaas kii pratigya karnaa 3
 samyak vaak : hanikaarak baaten or jhut na bolnaa 4

 The knowledge found from Gautama Buddha is called Bodhi
 mana jaataa he ki bodhi paane ke baad hi sansar se chhutkaaraa paaya ja saktaa he
 Bodhi can be attained only by the perfection of all the parameters, the complete understanding of the four Aryan truths and the prevention of karma
 is samay, lobh, dosha, moh, avidya, trishna or atmaa main vishwaas sab gaayab ho jate he
 There are three levels of Bodhi: ावकravakodhodhi, each Bodhādhi and Samyakasobodhi
 samyaksambodhi bodh dharm kii sabase unnat adarsh maani jaati he
 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 sabhi buddha sampradaay tathagat buddha ke mul siddhant hi maanate hai
 The theory of pratyatamutpad states that any event exists in a complex cause-and-consequence web only because of other events
 praaniyon ke liye, iskaa arth he karm or vipaak ke anusaar anant sansar kaa chakra
 Because everything is eternal and eternal, nothing really exists
 har ghatana multah shunaya hoti he
 However, humans, who have the power of knowledge, can attain nirvana by abandoning Trishna, which is the cause of sorrow, turning the power destroyed in Trishna into knowledge and meditation
 is duniya main sab kuch kshanik he or nashwar he
 Nothing permanent
 parantu vaidic mat se virodh he
 The soul means 'I'
 kintu, praani sharir or man se bane he, jisame sthayitv nahi he

 isliye, 'mai'arthath aatma naam kii koi sthaayee chiz nahin
 What people consider to be a soul is an uninterrupted flow of consciousness
 aatma kaa sthaan man ne liya he
 Buddha has told how the creation of the universe in brahma-jala Sutra
 sristi kaa nirmaan hona or nasht hona baar-baar hota he
 Ishwara or Mahabrahma does not create the universe because the world operates on the rule of Pratyatmasutpad i
e
 the working-sense
 bhagwaan buddha ke anusaar, manushyon ke du:kha or sukh ke liye karm jimmedaar he, ishwar yaa mahabrahma nahi
 But elsewhere Buddha has called the supreme truth indescribable
 shoonyata mahayan buddha sampradaay kaa pradhan darshan he
 He values people of his own sect
 buddha dharm kaa matlab nirashavad nahin he
 Grief does not mean pessimism, but relativism and realism
 buddha, dhamm or sangh buddha dharm ke teen triratne hai
 There are four components of the union of monk, nun, upasaka and upasika

 buddha bananaa hi bodhisattva ke jivan kii paraakaashtha he
 This identity is named Bodhi
 kaha jaataa he ki buddha shakyamuni keval ek buddha hai - unke pehle bahut saare the or bhavishya main or honge
 He said that anyone can become a Buddha if he attains the Bodhisattva by following the ten Paramitas in full and attains the ten forces or lands after the Bodhisattva
 buddha dharm kaa antim lakshya he sampoorn maanav samaaj se dukh kaa ant
 "I teach only one substance - there is sorrow, there is a cause of sorrow, there is a cure for sorrow, and there is a way to restrain sorrow"
 buddha dharm ke anuyaayi ashtangik maarg par chalakar na ke anusaar jikar agyanta or dukh se mukti or nirvana paane kii koshish karte hai
 The Sangh occupies a large place in Buddhism
 is dharm main buddha, dhamm or sangh ko 'triratn' kaha jaataa he
 Regarding the rule of union, Gautama Buddha said that small rules can make monks change
 un ke mahaparinirvana pashchaat sangh kaa aakaar main vyapak vruddhi hua
 After this growth, different people became attached to Buddha religion on the basis of different region, culture, social stage, initiation, etc
 and the rule of the Sangh started changing gradually
 saath hi main angutar nikaay ke kalam sutt main buddha ne apane anubhav ke aadhaar par dharm paalan karne kii swatantrata di he
 Therefore, due to scandal / change in the law of Vinaya, local cultural / linguistic aspect, freedom of individual religion, more or less added to the definite side of religion, due to various reasons, various sects and associations in Buddha religion were scrapped

 haalanki, yahaan ke buddha ke samay ke adhiktar pracheen vihaar nasht ho chuke hai
 Only a pillar of Emperor Ashoka as a relic testifies that Lord Buddha was born here
 is stambh ke alaava ek samadhi stupa main buddha kii ek murti he
 The Nepal government has also built two stupas here
 kareeb chah saal tak jagah-jagah or vibhinn guruon ke paas bhatakane ke baad bhi buddha ko kahin param gyaan na mila
 After this they reached Gaya
 aakhir main unhone pran liya ki jab tak asli gyaan uplabdh nahin hota, vah pipal vriksh ke neeche se nahin uthenge, chaahe unke praan hi kyon na nikal jaaen
 After this, for six days, under the Pipal tree day and night, he meditated hungry and thirsty
 aakhir main unhen param gyaan yaa buddhatv uplabdh hua
 Siddhartha Gautama had now become infinite knowledgeable like Akash after attaining enlightenment
 jis pipal vriksh ke neeche vah baithe, use bodhi vriksh yani gyaan kaa vriksh kahaan jaataa he
 At the same time, Gaya is also known as Bodh Gaya

 This is a Buddhist shrine
 lakhon kii sankhya main buddha anuyaayi or buddha dharm main ruchi rakhane vaale log har saal yahaan pahunchate hai
 The biggest reason for Buddhist followers to come here every year is that Lord Buddha gave his first sermon here
 sadiyon pehle isi sthaan se unhone dharm-chakra-pravartan prarambh kiya tha
 Buddhist followers also consider Sarnath's clay, stones and kankars as sacred
 sarnath kii darshneey vastuon main ashok kaa chaturmukh singh stambh, bhagwaan buddha kaa pracheen mandir, dhamek stupa, chaukhandi stupa, aadi shaamil hai
 Kushinagar is a very big pilgrimage site for Buddhist followers
 bhagwaan buddha kushinagar main hi mahaparinirvana ko praapt hue
 The Buddha breathed his last near the Hiranyavati river near Kushinagar
 rambar stupa ke nikat unka antim sanskaar kiya gaya
 Apart from Buddhist followers, Kushinagar is also a center of attraction for tourist lovers, 55 km from the district Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh
 80 varsh kii aayu main sharir tyaag se pehle baari sankhya main log buddha se milane pahunche
