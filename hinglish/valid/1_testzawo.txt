 The head of the true sperm is made up of only the nucleus, in which the amount of cytoplasm is very small
 andey or shukranu ke cendrak kaa ek duusare se samekan hota he
 With the division of the joint nucleus, the division of cytoplasm also continues
 sansechan se do kaary siddh hote hai
 One is that the genetic material of the male and female is collected by this action, and the other is the stimulation of the egg by this action, which initiates a series of complex but coordinated methods, called embryonic development
 yugmaj khandibhavan yoke kii maatra par nirbhar rahata he
 Eggs with less yoke or yoke are wholly subdivided, and yoke-oriented eggs are undifferentiated

 This cavity is the arcatron and the fetus is now in the state of the gastrula
 bhrun ke bheetar praveya karanevaali koshikaaye ant:sth kshetra se aati hai
 The cavity within the blastula, the blastocycle, begins to shrink forward and downward due to penetration within these cells and due to the spread of the arcatron, and the cells that enter the inner region form the roof of the arcatron
 blastopor kaa gruve daahine or baayein failata he
 Then this groove comes down on both sides and takes the shape of a circular hole
 isi bich nichle dhruv kii badi-badi koshikaaye bhrun ke bhitari bhaag main pravesh kar jaati hai
 But for some time, a group of these large cells remain in the mouth of the blastopore called the yolk plug

 pramitive stric vah sthaan he jahaan epiblast kii koshikaaye bhrun ke bheetar pravesh karti hai or notocordal somite tathaa parshv patt banaati hai
 The primitive streak of the blastoderm of mammalian animals is also of this nature
 is liye pramitive stric ko anfibia ke slastopor ke samaan samajha jaataa he
 Initially, embryonic growth in the egg was similar to that of birds, but resembled that of an underlying aphibia
 gahan koshika vibhaajan ke kaaran pelucida kshetra ke madhya main ek rekha utpann ho jaati he, jise pramitive note yaa primitive patt kehete hai
 In this area, a cavity is formed due to ingestion, ie, the bottom of the cells is pressed down
 is guha ke dwaara ko anfibia ke bhrun ke blastopor ke samaan or guha ko arcentrek guha ke samaan samajha ja saktaa he
 The lamprey has zygotic fragmentation and a partial image of the parts of the blastula is similar to that of gastrulation anphibia
 yoke kii adhikta ke kaaran machhliyon main yugmaj khandan meroblastic hota he or bhrun yosmooh ke upar ek koshikasmooh ke rup main parivardhit hota he
 But the blastoderm spreads downwards, eventually enclosing the entire yoke
 is failaav ke saath hi sambhavi madhyajanstar koshikaon kaa antargaman bhi hota he
 On the fate diagram of the blastula of salmon fish, the majority of the entire area is found surrounded by potential mesodermal and neural tissues

 In dipnoan ceratodus the blastomeres are small, but there is zygotic fragmentation
 balastopor kii utpatti anfibia ke sadrush hoti he
 After gastrulation, the three primary embryonic levels of the classical embryo, the ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm are definitely established
 samparikshatmak bhruntatv ne yah siddh kar diya he ki bahirjanstar or madhyajanstar antirnimeya hai
 In anphibia, the exudate is located on the outer floor of the gastrula
 pratiprishth ke bahirjanstar or madhyajanstar ke bahari bhaag, twachaa, uske upang or uski grathiyon ko utpann karte hai
 After gastrulation, the differentiation of cells located above the notochordal mediastinum begins and the region translocates to the neural plate, which begins to press down, respectively
 saath hi neural patt ke donon ore ke kinare upar uthne lagate hai
 Finally, when the two sides meet with each other, they consolidate, eventually resulting in a neural band called a neural tube
 is tantricanal ke aage kaa bhaag mastishk or tatsambandhi gyanendriyon ke samvedak bhaag or kapaal tantrikaon ko utpann karata he
 The spinal cord and its nerves arise from the posterior part

 In anaphibia, the yolk is present in the cytoplasm of the blastomere, based on which embryonic changes occur
 parantu uragon or pakshiyon main blastodarm yoke ke baahar hota he
 From this, the nutrient can reach the blastoderm only through the blood drains, which need change
 pakshiyon kaa blastodarm falkar yoke punj ko chaaron ore se gher letaa he
 In this way, the part made like a bag is called yoke kosha
 blastodarm sheeghra hi jin do bhaagon main vibhakt ho jaataa he ve hai-bhruneey or bhrunathit bhaag
 Blood capillaries are produced in the undeformed part
 is prakaar vasculus kshetra kii utpatti hoti he
 The veins of this region spread throughout the yolk corpus and exploit the yoke, and through this this nutrient reaches the blastoderm
 uragon main bhi yaheen yantra paaya jaataa he
 In mammalian animals, the yoke does not occur, but at the time of embryonic development the yolk sac is produced
 iske atirikt uragon, pakshiyon or stanadhariyon main do fital jhilliyaan bhi banati hai, jinako ulb or elatois kehete hai
 In birds, an ulceration is produced on both sides of the embryo and back and forth

 software utpaada taiyaar karne main mahatvapurn kaary aavashyaktaaon kaa pataa karnaa yaa aavashyaktaaon kaa vishleshan karnaa he
 They have a particularly abstract idea of what customers want as the end result, not what the software should do
 At this point, incomplete, unclear or conflicting requirements are identified by skilled and experienced software engineers
 sajiv code kaa pradarshan aksar hi karte rahane se aavashyaktaaon ke galat rahane kaa jokhim kam ho saktaa he
 Once the general requirements have been collected from the customers, then the analysis of the scope of development should be determined and expressed clearly
 ise aksar ek kaary-kshetra sambandhi dastavej kaha jaataa he
 Some functionality may be out of the scope of the project due to cost functions or the consequences of ambiguous requirements at the beginning of development
 yadi vikaas bahya rup se kiya jaataa he, to is dastauez ko ek kanoonee dastavej mana ja saktaa he taaki yadi kabhi koi vivaad ho to graahak ko kiye gaye vaadon ke sambandh main kisi bhi sanshayta ko spasht kiya ja sake
 Domain analysis is often the first step in designing a new software
 chaahe yah vartmaan software main koi parivardhan, ek nayaa program, ek nayaa upatantr yaa ek purna nayi vyavastha ho
 Assuming that developers are not proficient in the subject area of the new software, the first task is to locate the so-called 'domain' of the software
 domen ke sambandh main ve pehle se hi jitne adhik jaankaar hote hai, utane kam kaam kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Another objective of this work is to talk with experts in that field in their own terminology of the domain of the analysts receiving and collecting the requirements in order to develop a better understanding of the statements expressed by these experts
 yadi vishleshak uchit shabdaawalee kaa prayog nahin karata he to yah sambhaavna he ki unki baton ko gambhirtha se nahin liya jaayegaa
 is prakaar, yah charan aavashyaktaaon kaa pataa karne or use ekatrit karne main ek mahatvapurn prastaavna hogi
 Confusion can arise if an analyst has not done the right thing: "I know that you believe that you understand what you think in relation to what i said, but i am not sure in this regard You understand that i did not mean what you heard
 " vinirdesh vah kaary he jiske arntagat likhe jane vaale software kaa sambhawatah sahi bhang se varnan kiya jaataa he
 In practice, the most successful specifications are written to make understanding and more favorable to already well-developed programs
 yadhyapi aksar program ke vikaas ke purv suraksha kii drushti se atyant mahatvapurn software tantron kaa saavdhaneepurvak vistrut vivaran diya jaataa he
 Specifications are most important for external interfaces that must be fixed
 a good way to determine whether the specifications are sufficiently accurate is to have documents reviewed by third parties to ensure pure competence of requirements and usage conditions
 ek software system yaa software sanrachana kii banaavat us tantra kaa ek amoort nirupan he
 The relationship of the structure is to ensure that the software system will meet the product requirements, as well as to ensure that the requirements can be discussed in relation to the future
 sanrachana sambandhi kadam software system or anya software utpaadon ke bich interpheson, saath hi saath antarnihit hardware yaa parichaarak prachaalan system kii charchaa karata he
 Implementation is a part of the process where software engineers write code programs for the project
 software pareekshan software deveopment prakriya kaa ek abhinn or mahatvapurn hissaa he
 This part of the process ensures that the bug is identified as early as possible
 bhavishya main rakrakhaav or software main vruddhi karne ke uddeshy se software ke aantarik dizin kaa dastavejikaran sampoorn vikaas ke dauraan kiya jaataa he
 This may include authoring an API, whether external or internal

 Software training and support is important, as a large percentage of software projects fail due to developers not realizing that if no one in the organization makes final use of the software then the software developed by the team developing it The time and the planning that goes into preparing it is of no importance
 log aksar parivartan ke pratirodhi hote hai or ek aparichit kshetra main jokhim uthaane se bachate hai
 So as part of the deployment phase, it is very important to conduct training classes for new customers of your software
 nae avishkrut samasyaon yaa nayi aavashyaktaaon kaa saamana karne ke liye software ke anurakshan or uske parivardhan main software ke aarambhik vikaas kii apeksha adhik samay lag saktaa he
 To correct an unexpected problem, it is necessary to add a code that does not fit the original design, or it may be that a customer is requesting more functionality and the code can be added to accommodate their request
 is
 isi charan main graahakon ke kol praapt hote hai or aap dekhte hai ki graahak dwaara prayog karne ke purv kya aapkaa pareekshan samasyaon ko dur karne ke liye vyapak rup se paryaapt tha
 If the labor cost of the maintenance phase is more than 25% of the labor cost of the earlier phases, then it is likely that the overall quality of at least one prior stage is not good
 us sthiti main, prabandhan ko anurakshan sambandhi laagat aniyantrit hone ke purv system ko punarnirmit karne ke vikalp par vichaar karnaa chahie
 Bug tracking system tools are often deployed at this stage of the process to allow development teams to engage with interfaces with customers / area teams testing software that identify any real or perceived issues

 In order to help people involved in removing the curtain from important issues long before problems, iterative development determines the structure of small but always larger parts for a software project initially
 punraritiya prakriyaaon ko vanijyik developers ke dwaara adhik pasand kiya jaataa he, kyonki yah apni maang ko paribhaashit karne main asamarth graahak ke abhikalp lakshyon tak pahunchane kii sambhavyata kii anumati pradaan karata he
 Agile software development processes are built on the foundation of iterative development
 ve us neenv main ek adhik halkaa, paaramparik drushtikonon kii apeksha adhik lok-kendrit drushtikon jodate hai
 Agile processes use feedback rather than planning as the primary control system
 feedback niyamit pareekshanon or viksit hone vaale software ke relies hone se prerit hota he
 Extreme programming is the best known iterative process
 pehle ke puraane "batch" prakriyaaon kii apeksha XP main, charnon ko atyadhik chote charnon main puraa kiya jaataa he
 The first phase goes through those steps, which can take a day or a week, compared to the months and years it takes for each completed phase of the waterfall model
 sabase pehle, vyakti vikaas ke liye thos lakshya uplabdh karaane ke liye computarikrut pareekshanon ko ankit karata he
 The next stage is code writing, which is completed after all the tests have passed and the programmer does not feel the need to do more tests
 dizin or sanrachana, rifracturing se utpann hoti he or kuta lekhan ke baad aati he
 The design is done by the same people who do the code writing
 ke liye prabhavakaari bhang se prayukt yaa prardashit kii jaati he 
 is bindu par, visheshgy system ke agle sabase mahatvapurn bhaag ke liye pareekshan lekhan punah shuru karte hai
 The waterfall model illustrates a process where developers have to follow these steps in order: jis prakaar dhaancha khadaa hone ke baad nirmaankarta ghar kii neenv nahin badalata he, prayek kadam ke puraa hone ke baad prakriya apane agle kadam main aage badhati jaati he
 It is a misconception that there is no mechanism to correct errors in the initial steps in this process
 In fact, it is at this place that the management of requirements comes to the fore, which includes control over change
 prakriya ke aalochakon dwaara punrariti kii shuruyaat ke dwaara samasyaon ko dur karne main prativaadee tark mahatvapurn rup se ek badi hui laagat hoti he
 This is also a factor that increases delivery time and makes the process increasingly unpopular even in high-risk projects
 is drushtikon kaa prayog ucch jokhim vaali pariyojnaon, vishesh rup se raksha sambandhi bade anubandhon, main kiya jaataa he
 Problems at waterfall do not arise from "immature engineering practices, particularly in requirements analysis and management"
 waterfol ko lagu karne vaali DOD-STD-2167 ke vinirdesh dar kii vifaltaa ke adhyayan ne yah darshaya he ki vishesh rup se agrim aavashyaktaaon ke sangrah main, koi pariyojna apni prakriya kaa jitna adhik dhyanpurvak paalan karata he, pariyojna dwaara varttman rup main aprayukt visheshtaon ko jari karne kii utani adhik sambhaavna hoti he
 Often the perceived stages are part of the review between the customer and the supplier
 vastav main, aapurtikarta jokhim main vikaas kar saktaa he or dizin kaa vikaas kar saktaa he, lekin use dizin ko mile ke pathar critical dizin rivyuu ko kam keemat main avashya bechnaa chahie
 This displaces the load of engineering from engineers to customers who have other skills
 aupchaarik paddatiyaan aavashyaktaaon, vinirdesh or dizin ke str par software kii samasyaon ko hal karne ke ganitiya drushtikon hai
 Examples of formal methods include B-method, Petri nets, proving automated theorems, RAISE and VDM
 vibhinn aupchaarik vinirdesh sanketan, jaise ki z sanketan uplabdh hai
 More generally, the automatic model theory can be used to construct and confirm the application trend by designing systems of finite state devices
 parimit avasthaa yantra aadhaarit paddatiyaan nishpaadya software vinirdesh or paaramparik kutalekhan ke liye upmarg banane kii anumati pradaan karti he 
 Formal methods can more likely be applied in domain software, particularly where software is important in terms of security
 software suraksha guarantee maanak, jaise ki DO178B vargeekaran ke ucchtam str par aupchaarik vidhiyon kii maang karti hai
 In other places, the classification of software development is spreading, along with the application of model-driven structures that allow the execution of target resistance language and specifically design, even if not specification
 software ke vikaas main ek anya ubhartee hui pravriti tark ke kisi rup main ek vinirdesh lekhan karnaa or phir us tark kaa nishpaadan usee prakaar karnaa he jaise ki yah koi program ho
 An example of this is the OWL language based on description logic
 taarkik rup main or taarkik rup se angreji ke kuch sanskarnon roopon kaa swatah pratichitran karne or tark ko sidhe nishpadit karne kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 Examples of this are controlled natural English language and Internet business logic, which do not have to control the dictionary or syntax

 Eric John Ernest Hobsbawm was an outstanding Marxist historian, thinker and politician of the twentieth century
 18 veen sadi ke ant se lekar, sampurna 19veen sadi evam lagbhag puri beesvin sadi kii kalavadhi par kendrit unke charkhandee itihaas lekhan ne unhen atyadhik prasiddhi dilaayi
 Eric Hobsbawm was born in Alexandria in June 1917 into a Jewish family
 unke pita british yahudee or mata madhya europea thi
 His early education took place in Vienna and later in Berlin
 1930 ke dashak main unhen england janaa padaa kyonki germany main yahudiyon ke astitv par khatra tha
 While at Cambridge, he did his higher education
 berlin main unhone naajiyon ke fasiwad ko unki yahudee virdohi gatividhiyon ke rup main to samajha hi, saath-saath nagarikon kii saamaanya swatantraaa ko nakaarne ke rup main bhi uskaa anubhav unhen hua
 As a result, they became communists and began to accept socialism as the only remedy for fascism
 unki yah patibaddhta aaajeevan bani rahi
 He was awarded a scholarship to study history at Cambridge University, due to which he was able to meet a group of historians who were interviewed immediately by Marxism and who used to read political and diplomatic history, this new vision of social and economic history

 erik hobsabom ne unnisvin sadi ke europe ko apana shodh kshetra chunaa tha, kyonki europe main hi aise bahut saare vikaas sabase pehle hue jinhone sadaa ke liye logon ke jivan ko parivartit kar diya or kalantar main asia, africa or latin america ko bhi apane daayre main le liya
 This is the reason that despite his research in history focused on nineteenth century Europe, his vision never remained Europe-centric
 erik hobsabom kaa sarvaadhik prasiddh lekhan kaary unnisvin sadi ke vikaas kram kaa alag-alag khandon main prastut adhyayan he
 The first book in this series focuses on the era of revolution - 1789–1848, the dual effects of the industrial and French revolutions, their contribution to the modern world made up of democracy and inequality, and the emergence of the idea of populist politics and sovereignty that brought rulers closer to the masses
 Worked poonji kaa yug - 1848-1875, duniya bhar main poonji kii prabhavatmak vijay kii kahani he ki kaise poonji ne logon ke aantarik jivan, parivaar or saanskrithik mulyon ko roopantarit kiya or kaise isane apane aaine main is duniya ko dhaal liya

 In the context of this section and these events, Nalini Taneja has written that "these events are so close to us that reading them from the point of view of Hobsbawm, it seems that from our grandfathers, great grandfathers before our eyes, we would have opened the pages of our own lives

 itihaas lekhan main unhone ek alag drushti apanaai jo tathyon ko sarvocch maanati he lekin unke prabhaavon ko taatkalikta tak simit nahin rakhti
 Despite his commitment to Marxism, Hobsbawm stayed away from bigotry
 unka maananaa tha ki marxvaadi itihaas koi alag dhruv nahin he or use aitihaasik chintan va shodh kii viraasat se alag karke nahin dekha ja saktaa
 Hobsbawm was not hesitant to say that in the field of historical research, Marx should not be viewed as a departure point but as a departure point
 naresh goswami ke anusaar "hobsabom agar apni sabase nazadiiki vichaardhaara ke bare main itnaa khulaa ravaiya akhtiyaar kar sakate hai to isse yahi jaahir hota he ki ve vichaardhaara kaa chakachaundh paidaa karne ke liye nahin balki parighatnaon or pravritiyon ko zyada sugrahya banane ke liye upyog karte hai
 They have a disloyal allegiance to the facts which they do not allow to dominate their ideological tendencies
 unhen marks kaa itihaas ko dekhne kaa bhautikwaadi nazariyaa isliye mahatvapurn lagata he, kyonki uske bina madhyayug ke baad hone vaale roopantaran ko sahi dhang se nahin samajha ja saktaa
 But if they find anything irrelevant or infrequent in Marx, they move forward instead of being compelled
 " According to the well-known historian Romila Thapar, "eric Hobsbawm was one of the historians whose most work centered on the last three centuries of European history
 iske baavjood ve ham jaise itihaaskaaron ke liye bhi praasangik the jinka sarokaar unase bhinn desh-kaal se rahaa he
 For him, historical research was not limited to narrow engagement with a particular subject, but rather broadened its horizons by involving many people and ideas
