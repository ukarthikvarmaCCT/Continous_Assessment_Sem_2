 Marine pollution occurs when chemicals, particles, industrial, agricultural and residential waste, noise, or invasive organisms enter the ocean and produce harmful effects, or possibly harmful effects

 Minisz believes that one of the worst examples is the jellyfish, which does not seem to be harmful when it comes to the only invasive species that can harm the ecosystem
 Nemiopsis leidi, a species of comb jellyfish, spread so much that it is present in many creeks around the world today
 1982 main pehali baar iskaa pataa chalaa or mana jaataa he ki ye krishna sagar main kisi jahaaz ke sthirak pani ke zarie pahunchi hogi
 The number of jellyfish increased abruptly and by 1988 it became a headache for the local fisheries industry
 "1984 main ankavi machhlee kii pakad 204,000 ton thi jabaki 1993 main yah ghatakar 200 ton rah gai; sprat 1984 main 24,600 ton se ghatakar 1993 main 12,000 ton; or horse maikerala jo 1984 main 4,000 ton pakadi gai thi, 1993 main ek bhi nahin pakadi gai"

 Sea level mining is a relatively new technique of mining of minerals which is implemented at sea level
 mahasaagaron main khanan ke sthaan saadharantah samudri sataha se 1,400-3,700 meter neeche, polimatlik nodules ke bade hisson ke, yaa phir sakriya or lupt hydrothermal chhidron ke aasapaas hote hai
 These holes form sulfide deposits which contain silver, gold, copper, manganese and noble metals like cobalt and zinc
 in bhandaron kaa khanan hydrolic panpon yaa phir bakat pranali dwaara kiya jaataa he jisase ayask ko parishkrut karne ke liye zamin par laayaa jaataa he
 As with all mining processes, sea level mining has also raised questions about the damage to the environment in the surrounding area
 kyonki samudr tal khanan apekshaakrit ek nayaa kshetra he, isliye bade str par khanan kii purna prakriya ke nattejey abhi agyaat hai
 Although experts believe that removal of portions of the ocean floor will cause disturbances in the benthic layer, toxicity in the water column and increase in sediment plumes
 samudr tal ke hisson ko hataane se benthit jeev-jantuon ke prakritik vaas ko nuksaan pahonchega, gadabadi sthaayee bhi ho sakati he, nirbhar karata he ki khanan kaa tarika or sthaan kaisaa he
 Apart from the direct impact of the mining of the area, leakage and decay can also change the chemical composition of the mining area
 samudr tal khanan ke prabhaavon main, cediment plums kaa sabase zyada prabhaav ho saktaa he
 Plumes are formed when debris from mining is dumped back into the sea, causing a cloud of particles to float in the water
 plums do prakaar ke hote hai: samudr tal par paae jane vaale or sataha par paae jane vaale
 samudr tal par paae jane vaale plums tab banate hai jab malbe ko neeche khanan sthaan main waapas pump kar diya jaataa he
 These floating particles increase the turbidity of the water and block the filter-feeding equipment used by benthic organisms
 sataha par paae jane vaale plums or bhi zyada gambhir samasya ko anjaam dete hai
 These plumes can spread over a large area depending on the size of the particles and the flow of water
 ye plums pranimandaplavakon or prakaash ke pravesh ko prabhavit kar sakate hai, jisase kshetra ke food web ko nuksaan pahunch saktaa he
 The potential consequences of acidification of the oceans are not yet fully known, although there is a concern that structures made of calcium carbonate can easily dissolve, causing the ability of coral-rock as well as shellfish to produce snails or oysters
 May be affected
 
 Ocean and coastal ecosystems play an important role in the global carbon cycle and have removed about 25 percent of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activities between the years 2000 and 2007 and half the amount of CO2 released by humans to the atmosphere since the start of the Industrial Revolution

 This zone is a delicate zone where most marine life takes birth or lives
 haalanki ye report sirf vancuvar se uttari california tak ke ilaakon ke sambandhit thi, duusare mahadwipiya shelf kshetra bhi samaan prabhaav anubhav kar rahe honge
 a related issue is the methane clathrate deposits found below sea level
 ye badi maatra main greenhouse gas methane ko sokhte hai, jo mahasagariya taapan ke zarie nikal sakati he
 According to estimates made in 2004, ocean methane clathrates exist in the region of one to five million cubic kilometers
 agar ye cletherate samudr tal par samroop bichhaae jate hai to inaki parat teen se chaudaa meter moti hogi
 These estimates are equivalent to 500 to 2500 gigatons of carbon and can be compared to other fossil fuel reserves which are also estimated at 5000 gigatons
 utrophication paristhitik tantra main rasaynic poshak tatwon kaa badhanaa he, khaskar wo yogic padaarth jinamein nitrogen or phosphorus hota he
 It can increase the basic fertility of the ecosystem and at the same time it reduces the quality of water including lack of oxygen and this affects the number of fish and other aquatic organisms
 isaki sabase badi doshi nadiyaan he jo mahasaagaron main milti hai or iske saath hi krishi main istemaal kiye gaye kai urvarak or jaanwaron evam manushyon kaa mel samudr main miltaa he
 Excess of oxygen-reducing chemicals in water leads to hypoxia and creates a dead zone

 It has been suggested that accumulating reactive nitrogen in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can have serious consequences
 XXX Sea debris is mainly waste thrown by humans which floats or swings in the sea
 samudri malbe kaa assi pratishat hissaa plastic he- ek aisa avyav jo dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad se bahut tezi se jamaa ho rahaa he
 The plasticity present in the oceans can be equal to one hundred million metric tons
 tyaage gaye plastic bag, sicks pack rings or anya plastic kachra jo samudron main pravesh karata he, wo vanya jeev-jantuon or matsay udyog ke liye khatra he
 This poses a risk of life getting stuck, breathlessness and ingestion

 These nets, known as ghost nets, can trap fish, dolphins, sea turtles, sharks, dugongs, crocodiles, seabirds, crabs, and other animals, disrupting their movement, causing starvation, biting meat or limbs and Infections can occur and organisms that come to sea surfaces to breathe die of suffocation
 kai jantu jo samudr main jite hai yaa phir in par nirbhar karte hai, behate hue kachare ko nigal sakate hai, kyonki wo aksar unke shikaar kii tarah dikhataa he
 Plastic waste, when gross and entangled, is difficult to swallow and may remain permanently stored in the stomach or intestine of these animals, blocking food passage and death from hunger and infection
 plastic ekatra hota rahata he kyonki wo duusare padaarthon kii tarah biodigradable yani swabhik tareeke se sadansheel nahin hota he
 They are definitely photodegraded by exposure to sun rays, but they do so only in dry conditions, because water stops this process
 samudri vaataavaran main photodigradid plastic or bhi chote tukdon main vighatit hota he, jabaki bache hue polimar, aanvik str tak vighatit hote hai
 When floating plastic particles photodegrade in the shape of zooplankton, the jellyfish try to swallow them and thus the plastic enters the seafood chain

 jalprasaarit jal virdohi pradooshak plastic kachare kii sataha par ikattha or aavardhan hote hai or plastic ko samudr main usase or bhi zyada khatarnaak bana dete hai, jitna wo zamin par hote hai
 Waterborne contaminants are naturally known as bioaccumulates in adipose tissue and naturally make the food chain even larger thus putting pressure on the top predators
 kuch plastic yogaj grahan hone par antahstravi tantra ko bhi ast-vyast kar dete hai, jabaki kuch pratirakshi tantra ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai yaa phir prajnan dar ko gata sakate hai

 vifaille prabhaavon ke alaava, jab inamen se kuch grahan kar liye jate hai to jaanwaron kaa mastishk inhen estrodeol samaj saktaa he, jisase jeev-jantuon main hormone prabhavit ho sakate hai
 Apart from plastic, other toxic materials that do not dissolve rapidly in marine environments have a different problem
 pcbs, DDT, kitnashak, furans, diaoxins, phinols or radiodharmee kachra aise dirghasthayee vish ke udhaaharan hai
 Heavy metals are chemical elements that are relatively high in density and are poisonous even at low concentrations
 paara, sisa, nikal, arsenic or cadmium iske udhaaharan hai
 Such toxins are collected in the tissues of aquatic species by a process called bioaccumulation

 Marine life can be easily affected by noise pollution, especially by passing ships, oil exploration seismic surveys and naval low-frequency active sonar
 The speed of sound in the sea is much higher than the atmosphere and it covers a greater distance
 samudri jeevon kii, jaise kii setecins, dekhne kii kshamta aksar kam hoti he or ye dhwani ke zarie hi jaankaree hasil karte hai
 This also applies to deep-sea fish, which live in darkness

 Noise causes the species to communicate loudly, which is called the Lombard vocal response
 whale machhlee kii awaz lambii hoti he jab pandubbi sansuchak chaalu hote hai
 If the creatures do not "communicate" in a loud voice, their voice is subdued under anthropogenic sounds
 ye ansuni awaazen chetavanee, shikaar kii khoj yaa phir net-babling kii taiyaariyaan ho sakati hai
 When one species begins to speak loudly, it suppresses the voice of another species, causing the entire ecosystem to speak loudly
 samudr vaigyanik silvia arl ke mutabik, "samudri ke andar dhwani pradooshan, hazaar ghaavon ke saath marane ke baraabar he
 Every sound may not be a matter of great concern, but if ships noise, seismic survey and military activities are taken together then a completely different atmosphere is created which existed even fifty years ago
 dhwani pradooshan kaa ye badha hua str, samudri jivan par kadaa or vyapak asar daalega hi
" Most anthropogenic pollution enters the ocean
 byorn janson ne apane lekh main likhaa he, "maanavajanit pradooshan samudri paristhitik tantra kii jaev-vividhta or utpaadakta ko gata saktaa he, jisase maanav ke samudri bhojan sansaadhan kam or khatm ho sakate hai" 
 There are two ways of reducing this overall level of pollution: either reducing the human population, or finding a way to reduce the ecological footprint left by a common human
 If this second path is not adopted, then the first path may have to be established, because the world's ecosystems are disturbed
 doosraa rasta manushyon ke liye he ki wo vyaktigat taur par kam pradooshan failaaen

 Marine pollution is often difficult to control because pollution transcends international borders, making it difficult to make and implement regulations
 kadaachit samudri pradooshan ko kam karne kii sabase mahatvapurn samrik niti shiksha he
 Most people are unaware of the harmful effects of sources and marine pollution and therefore fewer steps can be taken to deal with this situation
 janata ko sabhi tathyon kii jaankaree dene ke liye, gahan shodh kii zarurat he taaki sthiti kaa puraa byora diya ja sake
 And then this information should be conveyed to the public

 shreneehindhan Industrial disputes are disputes that arise due to a disagreement in industrial relations
 audyogic sambandh shabd se niojak or karmchaariyon ke bich; karmchaariyon ke bich tathaa niojakon ke bich paraspar sanvaadon ke kai pahalu jude hue hai
 Whenever there is a conflict of interest in such a relationship, dissatisfaction arises in any one of the parties connected with it and thus an industrial dispute or conflict takes place, this dispute takes many forms such as protest, strike, picket, Lockout, layoffs, dismissal of employees, etc
 audyogic vivaad ke kuch mukhya kaaran is prakaar he:- In India, the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is a major legislation to investigate and settle all industrial disputes
 is adhinium main un sambhaavnaaon kii hadtaal athwa talabandi kii ja sakati he, unhen avaidh athwa gaiyr-kanoonee ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he, karmchaaree kii jabardastee kambandi, chantni, use sevamukt karnaa athwa gabarkhast karne kii dashaon, un paristhitiyon jinamein audyogic ikai ko band kiya ja saktaa he or audyogic karmchaariyon tathaa niojakon se jude anya kai maamalon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 The Act is administered by the Ministry of Labor through its Industrial Relations Division
 yah prabhag vivaadon kaa niptaan karne ke liye sansthagat dhaanchon main sudhaar karne or audyogic sambandhon se jude shramik kanoonon main sanshodhan karne se sambandhit he
 It works in good harmony with the Central Industrial Relations Machinery in an effort to ensure that the country has a sustainable, reputable and efficient workforce that cannot be exploited and is capable of establishing high levels of production
 siaiaram jo ki shram mantralay kaa ek sanghathan karyaalay he ko mukhya shram ayukta sanghathan ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he

php landow-ramanujan sthirankaramanujan-sholdener sthirankaramanujan theta falnarogers-ramanujan tatsamakaramanujan abhajyakrutrim theta falanbus Srinivasa Ramanujan Iyengar was a great Indian mathematician
 inhen aadhunik kaal ke mahanatam ganit vichaarkon main gina jaataa he
 He did not get any special training in mathematics, yet he made deep contributions in the areas of analysis and number theory
 inhone apane pratibha or lagan se na keval ganit ke kshetra main adbhut avishkaar kiye varan bharat ko athulaneey gaurav bhi pradaan kiya
 He was a brilliant genius since childhood
 inhone khud se ganit siikhaa or apane jeevanabhar main ganit ke 3,884 pramayon kaa sankalan kiya
 Most of these theorems have been proved correct
 inhone ganit ke sahaj gyaan or bijganit prakalan kii adwitiya pratibha ke bal par bahut se moulik or aparmparik parinaam nikaale jinase prerit shodh aaj tak ho rahaa he, yadhyapi inaki kuch khojon ko ganit mukhyadhara main ab tak nahin apanaaya gaya he
 Recently their formulas have been used in crystal science
 inke kaary se prabhavit ganit ke kshetron main ho rahe kaam ke liye ramanujan jarnal kii sthapana kii gai he
 Ramanujan was born on 22 December 1887 in the village of Erode, Coimbatore, in the southern part of India
 vah paaramparik brahman parivaar main janme the
 His mother's name was Komaltammal and his father's name was Srinivasa Iyengar
 inkaa bachapan mukhyatah kumbhakonam main beetaa tha jo ki apane pracheen mandiron ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Ramanujan's intellectual development in childhood was not like that of ordinary children
 yah teen varsh kii aayu tak bolnaa bhi nahin sikh paae the
 When Ramanujan did not start speaking till such a great age, everyone was worried that he would be dumb
 baad ke varshon main jab unhone vidhyalay main pravesh liya to bhi paaramparik shiksha main inkaa kabhi bhi man nahin laga
 Ramanujan attained the highest marks in the entire district in the primary examination at the age of ten and reached the town high school for further education
 ramanujan ko prashn poochna bahut pasand tha
 His questions sometimes seemed very strange to the teachers
 jaise ki-sansar main pehla purush koun tha? prithvi or badalon ke bich kii duuri kitni hoti he? ramanujan kaa vyavhaar bada hi madhur tha
 His somewhat more gross body and glowing eyes of curiosity gave him a different identity
 inke sahpaathiyon ke anusaar inkaa vyavhaar itnaa saumy tha ki koi inase naaraaz ho hi nahin saktaa tha
 His talent in the school started making a mark on other students and teachers
 inhone skool ke samay main hi kalege ke str ke ganit ko pard liya tha
 Once the headmaster of his school had also said that the criteria for examinations to be held in the school does not apply to Ramanujan
 hiskool kii pariksha uteern karne ke baad inhen ganit or angreji me achche ank laane ke kaaran subramanyam chaatravrutti mili or aage kalege kii shiksha ke liye pravesh bhi mila
 a further problem occurred
 ramanujan kaa ganit ke prati prem itnaa bad gaya tha ki ve duusare vishyon par dhyaan hi nahin dete the
 He used to solve mathematics questions even in history, biology classes
 nateeja yah hua ki gyarahavin kaksha kii pariksha main ve ganit ko chhod kar baaki sabhi vishyon main fail ho gaye or parinamswaroop unako chaatravrutti milani band ho gai
 One, the financial condition of the house was poor and scholarship was not being received from above
 ramanujan ke liye yah bada hi kathin samay tha
 He also did some maths tuition and ledger work to improve the condition of the house
 kuch samay baad 1907 main ramanujan ne phir se barahavin kaksha kii privet pariksha di or anuteern ho gaye
 And with this, their traditional education was celebrated
 vidhyalay chhodane ke baad kaa paanch varshon kaa samay inke liye bahut hataasha bharaa tha
 At this time India was caught in the shackles of subordination
 chaaron taraf bhayankar garibi thi
 At such a time, Ramanujan had neither a job nor an opportunity to work with any institute or professor
 bas unka ishwar par atoot vishwaas or ganit ke prati agaadh shraddha ne unhen kartavya maarg par chalane ke liye sadaiv prerit kiya
 Namgiri Devi was the Ishta Devi of Ramanujan's family
 unke prati atoot vishwaas ne unhen kahin rukne nahin diya or ve itani vipareet paristhitiyon main bhi ganit ke apane shodh ko chalaate rahe
 At this time Ramanujan used to get a total of five rupees monthly from tuition and lived in it
 ramanujan kaa yah jivan kaal bahut ksht or dukh se bharaa tha
 He always had to wander around to maintain his education and continue his education and had to plead unsuccessfully to many people
 varsh 1908 main inke mata pita ne inkaa vivaah janaki naamak kanya se kar diya
 After marriage, it was no longer possible for them to forget everything and drown in mathematics
 atah ve naukari kii talash main madras aae
 He did not get a job due to not passing the XII examination and his health also fell badly
 ab doctor kii salaah par inhen waapas apane ghar kumbhakonam lautnaa padaa
 After recovering from illness, he came back to Madras and started looking for a job again
 ye jab bhi kisi se milte the to use apana ek register dikhaate the
 This register contained all the work done by him in mathematics
 isi samay kisi ke kehane par ramanujan vahaan ke dipti colector shri ve
 ramasvami ayyar se mili
 Iyer was a great scholar of mathematics
 yahaan par shri ayyar ne ramanujan kii pratibha ko pahachaanaa or jiladhikari shri ramchandra raav se kah kar inke liye 25 rupaye masik chaatravrutti kaa prabandh bhi kar diya
 On this instinct, Ramanujan published his first research paper in Madras for a year
 shodh patr kaa sheershak tha "barnauli sankhyaon ke kuch gun” or yah shodh patr jarnal of indian mathematical socity main prakashit hua tha
 After completing one year here, he worked as a clerk in Madras Port Trust
 saubhaahgya se is naukari main kaam kaa boj kuch zyada nahin tha or yahaan inhen apane ganit ke liye paryaapt samay miltaa tha
 Here Ramanujan used to stay awake all night and write new mathematical formulas and then take a rest for a while and then leave for office
 ramanujan ganit ke shodhon ko slate par likhte the
 And later wrote it down in a register
 raat ko ramanujan ke slate or khadie kii aawaaj ke kaaran parivaar ke anya sadasyon kii neend chaupat ho jaati thi
 At this time there was a great distance between Indian and Western living and due to this Indians were generally very hesitant to present their things to the British scientists
 idhar sthiti kuch aisi thi ki bina kisi angrej ganitagya kii sahaayta liye shodh kaary ko aage nahin badhaayaa ja saktaa tha
 At this time Ramanujan's old well wishers came to his work and these people sent the work done by Ramanujan to the famous mathematicians of London
 par yahaan inhen kuch vishesh sahaayta nahin mili lekin ek laabh yah hua ki log ramanujan ko thodaa bahut jaanane lage the
 At the same time, Ramanujan showed some formulas of his number theory to Professor Seshu Iyer, then he turned his attention to Professor Hardy of London
 professor hardi us samay ke vishwa ke prasiddh ganitagyon main se ek the
 And was known for his strict nature and discipline
 professor hardi ke shodhakarya ko padhane ke baad ramanujan ne bataaya ki unhone professor hardi ke anuttarit prashn kaa uttar khoj nikaala he
 Now Ramanujan's correspondence with Professor Hardy began
 ab yahaan se ramanujan ke jivan main ek nae yug kaa sutarapaat hua jisamen professor hardi kii bahut badi bhoomika thi
 In other words, the way a jeweler identifies a diamond and shines it, Professor Hardy has some similar place in Ramanujan's life
 professor hardi aaajeevan ramanujan kii pratibha or jivan darshan ke prashansak rahe
 This friendship of Ramanujan and Professor Hardy proved beneficial for both
 ek tarah se dekha jaae to dono ne ek duusare ke liye poorak kaa kaam kiya
 Professor Hardy valued various talented people of that time on a scale of 100
 adhikansh ganitagyon ko unhone 100 main 35 ank die or kuch vishisht vyaktiyon ko 60 ank die
 But he gave Ramanujan a full 100 in 100 points
 aarambh main ramanujan ne jab apane kiye gaye shodhakarya ko professor hardi ke paas bheja to pehle unhen bhi puraa samaj main nahin aayaa
 When he consulted his friend mathematicians, he came to the conclusion that Ramanujan is a rare personality in the field of mathematics and that he should come to England to understand the work done by him and to further research in it
 atah unhone ramanujan ko cambridge aane ke liye aamantrit kiya
 For some personal reasons and lack of funds, Ramanujan declined Professor Hardy's invitation to Cambridge
 professor hardi ko isse niraashaa hui lekin unhonen kisi bhi tarah se ramanujan ko vahaan bulaane kaa nishchay kiya
 At the same time, Ramanujan got a research career at the University of Madras, which made his life a bit easier and he was also getting full time for research work
 isi bich ek lambey patravyavhaar ke baad dhire-dhire professor hardi ne ramanujan ko cambridge aane ke liye sahamat kar liya
 Ramanujan was also funded by Professor Hardy's efforts to go to Cambridge
 ramanujan ne england jane ke pehle ganit ke kareeb 3000 se bhi adhik naye sutron ko apni notebook main likhaa tha
 Ramanujan stepped on the land of London
 vahaan professor hardi ne unke liye pehle se vvavastha kii hui thi atah inhen koi vishesh pareshaani nahin hui
 Ramanujan had little trouble in England and the reason for this was his shy, calm nature and pure satvic lifestyle
 apane puure england pravaas main ve adhikanshtah apana bhojan swayan banaate the
 This journey of England brought a revolutionary change in his life
 unhone professor hardi ke saath mil kar ucchkoti ke shodhpatr prakashit kiye
 Due to his special research he was awarded BA by Cambridge University
 Also got the title of
 lekin vahaan kii jalwaayu or rahan-sahan kii style unke adhik anukool nahin thi or unka swasthya kharaab rahane laga
 The doctors called it tuberculosis
 us samay kshay rog kii koi dawa nahin hoti thi or rogi ko senetorium me rahanaa padataa tha
 Ramanujan also had to stay there for a few days
 vahaan is samay bhi yah ganit ke sutron main nai nai kalpanaaen kiya karte the
 After this, Ramanujan was named a Fellow of the Royal Society
 aise samay main jab bharat gulaami main ji rahaa tha tab ek ashwet vyakti ko royal socity kii sadsyta milanaa ek bahut badi baat thi
 In the entire history of the Royal Society, there has been no member younger than them till date
 puure bharat main unke shubhachintakon ne utsav manaaya or sabhaayen kii
 After membership of the Royal Society, he also became the first Indian to get the fellowship of Trinity College
 ab aisa lag rahaa tha ki sab kuch bahut acchhee jagah par ja rahaa he
 But Ramanujan's health was deteriorating and eventually he had to return to India on the advice of doctors
 bharat aane par inhen madras vishvavidhyalay main praadhyaapak kii naukari mil gai
 And Ramanujan was rekindled in teaching and research
 bharat lautne par bhi swasthya ne inkaa saath nahin diya or haalat gambhir hoti ja rahi thi
 In the case of this disease also, he wrote a high level research paper on mock theta function
 ramanujan dwaara pratipaadit is falan kaa upyog ganit hi nahin balki chikitsavigyaan main cancer ko samajhane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 His declining health became a matter of concern for all and even now doctors have given him the answer
 ant main ramanujan ke vidaa kii ghadi aa hi gai
 In the morning of 26 April 1920, he became unconscious and by midday he gave up his life
 is samay ramanujan kii aayu maatr 33 varsh thi
 His untimely demise was an irreparable loss to the mathematics world
 puure desh videsh main jisane bhi ramanujan kii mrityu kaa samachar suna vahiin stabdh ho gaya
 Ramanujan and most of the work done by him still remains an enigma for scientists
 ek bahut hi saamaanya parivaar main janm le kar puure vishwa ko aashcharyachakit karne kii apni is yatra main inhone bharat ko apurv gaurav pradaan kiya
 His old register on which he used to write his theorems and formulas was suddenly found in the library of Trinity College in 1976
 kareeb ek sau pannon kaa yah register aaj bhi vaigyanikon ke liye ek paheli bana hua he
 This register was later known as Ramanujan's note book
 mumbai ke tata moolbhoot anusandhan santhaan dwaara iskaa prakaashan bhi kiya gaya he
 Like Ramanujan's researches, his style of working in mathematics was also bizarre
 ve kabhi kabhi aadhi raat ko sote se jaag kar slate par ganit se sutara likhane lagate the or phir so jate the
 In this way it seemed that they were solving mathematics questions even in their dreams
 ramanujan ke naam ke saath hi unki kuladevi kaa bhi naam liya jaataa he
 He always kept in mind zero and infinite and used the mathematical formulas to explain its interrelationships
 ramanujan ke kaary karne kii ek visheshta thi
 Earlier, he used to write a new formula or theorem of mathematics but did not pay much attention to its origin
 iske bare main puche jane par ve kehete the ki yah sutara unhen namgiri devi kii krupa se praapt hue hai
 Ramanujan's faith in spirituality was so deep that he considered any work done in the field of mathematics as a part of spirituality
 ve dharm or aadhyatm main keval vishwaas hi nahin rakhte the balki use taarkik rup se prastut bhi karte the
 He used to say that "for me that mathematics formula does not mean that i do not get spiritual thoughts
" ” Ramanujan worked mainly in the field of number theory in England for five years
 ramanujan ne nimnlikhit sutara pratipaadit kiya- The specialty of this formula is that it expresses the relation of the two most famous constants of mathematics through an infinite continuous fraction

 tab arjuna chalaa jaataa he, kabhi waapas na lautne kaa iraadaa rakhte hue
 Ganga's younger siblings and grandmother secretly advise her to elope with Arjun
 ab ganga ko pataa chalata he ki vah arjuna se pyaar karti he or uski madad se gupt rup se ghar chhod detii he

 According to its pre-modern classical social understanding, the concept of civil society is generally associated with the early modern belief of the Enlightenment era of the 18th century
 tathaapi, raajnneetik vichaar ke daayre main iskaa bahut purana itihaas rahaa he
 In general, civil society is referred to as a political union governing social opposition through the imposition of rules that prevent citizens from harming one another
 pracheen yug main, avadharana kaa upyog achche samaaj ke ek paryaay ke rup main kiya gaya or ise rajya se aprabhedya ke rup main dekha gaya
 For example, Socrates taught that the inner conflict of society must be settled through public debate by the use of a 'dialectical method', a form of rational dialogue, to reveal the truth

 The philosophers of the ancient era made no distinction between state and society
 balki unki manyata thi ki raashtra samaaj ke naagarik rup kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or 'shishtachar' acchhee naagarikta kii zarurat kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 Furthermore, they believed that humans are inherently rational in that they can collectively shape the nature of the society in which they live
 saath hi, manushya main swechha se saamaanya hit main ekatrit hone or samaaj main shanti kaayam rakhane kii kshamta maujuud he
 Assuming this view, we can say that the ancient political thinkers supported the origin of civil society in its original sense

 These questions led him to certain beliefs about the nature of the human mind, sources of political and moral authority, the reasons behind dictatorship, and the exit from autocratic rule
 prabud vichaarkon ne maanav man main nihit achchhai par vishwaas kiya
 He opposed the alliance between the state and the church as an enemy of human progress and welfare because the coercive mechanisms of the nation prohibit personal liberty and the Church justified the emperors by the recognition of the doctrine of divine origin
 Therefore, both were considered against the likes of the people

 Some of his efforts led to social contract theory which tried to prove the existing social relations as invalid according to human nature
 unki manyata thi ki maanav prakruti ko vastugat vaastaviktaaon or prakritik kanoonee sthitiyon ke vishleshan dwaara samajha ja saktaa he
 In this way he supported that human nature should include the framework of the nation and established positive laws
 thomas hobs ne samaaj main sabhyataa banaae rakhane ke liye shaktishaalee rajya kii aavashyaktaa ko rekhaankit kiya
 For Hobbes, man is motivated by selfishness
 Furthermore, the nature of selfishness is often contradictory
 isliye, raashtra kii prakruti main, sabhi ke khilaaf sabhi ke yuddh kii sthiti shaamil thi
 In such a situation, life was "unsaid, bad, bad, animalistic and short"
 Realizing the danger of anarchy, humans became aware of the need for a mechanism to protect themselves
 jahaan tak hobs kaa sambandh tha, samajhadaari or swaarth ne manushya ko ek samjhaute main shaamil hone, samprabhutaa ko ek saajha shakti ke saamne samarpit karne ke liye prerit kiya 
 hobs ne is saajha shakti, raashtra ko timingal kaha
 The social contract theory of Thomas Hobbes put forward two types of relations
 a direct connection between a Timingale and a people; Hence the dedication of the people to Timingal
 The second system was the scope of horizontal relations between people
 is pranali main, timingal kii nigaraanee main, log, apane swaabhaavik adhikaron ko is prakaar simit karne ke liye baadhya the ki vah dusron ke adhikaron ko haani na pahunchaae
 pehali pranali raashtra ko dyotit karti he or duusari sabhy samaaj kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 In Hobbes's paradigm, the formation of civil society paved the way for government, nation, and law-making
 isliye, unke vichaar main, raashtra logon ke bich sabhyataa ko banaae rakhane ke liye aavashyak he
 Thus, Hobbes's concepts in relation to 'the nature of the nation' and 'sovereign nation' sprouted the seeds of realism that defined the nature of the relationship between the nation and civil society
 england kii raajnneetik paristhiti ke bare main jon loke kii avadharana hobs ke samaan hi thi
 It was an era of grand revolution, marked by a struggle between the throne's right to power and the political rights of Parliament
 isane loke ko simit raashtra or shaktishaalee samaaj ke saamaajik anubandh siddhant gadhane ke liye prabhavit kiya
 In Locke's view, humans were living turbulent lives in the nation of nature
 tathaapi, ek samuchit pranali kii anupasthiti main ise up-ishtatam str par banaae rakhaa ja saktaa he 
 us pramukh chintaa se, log ek anubandh par hastakshar karne ke liye ek saath ikattha hue or ek aam lok praadhikaran kaa gathan kiya gaya
 Nevertheless, Locke believed that the consolidation of political power could turn into autocracy if it was not brought under trustworthy restrictions
 Therefore, Locke set two treaties with mutual obligations to the government
 pehali sandhi main, logon ne swayan ko aam janata ke praadhikaar ke samaksh samarpit kiya
 This authority has the power to make and implement laws
 duusari sandhi main praadhikaar kii simaaen hai, yani raashtra ke paas manushya ke buniyadi adhikaron ko jokhim main daalane kii koi shakti nahin he
 As far as Locke was concerned, the basic rights of man are protection of life, liberty and property
 Furthermore, he believed that the nation would have to operate within the limits of civil and natural laws
 hobs or loke, donon ne ek aisi pranali nirdhaarit kii, jisamen saamaajik samjhaute yaa anubandh ke madhyam se manushyon ke bich shantipurna sashastitv sunishchit kiya ja saktaa he
 He believed that civil society is a community that maintains civic life, a nation where civic virtues and rights are derived from natural laws
 However, he did not believe that civilized society is a separate territory for the nation
 balki, unhone raashtra or naagarik samaaj ke sah-astitv ko rekhaankit kiya
 The systematic approach of Hobbes and Locke was largely influenced by the experiences of that era
 maanav prakruti, prakritik kanoon, saamaajik anubandh or sarkaar kii vyakhya karne ke unke prayaas ne daivi adhikaar siddhant ko chunauti di
 In contrast to divine authority, Hobbes and Locke claimed that humans could design their own political system
 is vichaar kaa prabodhan yug ke vichaarkon par kaafii prabhaav padaa
 Enlightened thinkers argued that humans are rational and can shape their destiny
 isliye, unhen niyantrit karne ke liye ek param satta kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Both jean-jacques Rousseau and Emmanuel Kant argued that people are peace loving and war is the product of autocratic rule
 As far as Kant is concerned, this system is effective for the dominance of single selfishness and immunity against the tyranny of the majority
 GWF hegel ne naagarik samaaj ke arth ko puri tarah se badal diya, jisane uski aadhunik naagarik raashtra sanstha ke bajaay bazaar samaaj ke rup main aadhunik udaar vyakhya ko janm diya
 Unlike his predecessors, this leading thinker of Romanticism considered civil society a separate sphere, a "system of needs", which stands for the satisfaction of personal interests and private property
 hegel kaa maananaa tha ki sabhy samaaj poonjeevaad kii vishesh avadhi main ubhara tha or uske swaarth kii purti kii thi: vyaktigat adhikaar or nijee sampatti 
 isliye, unhone "naagarik samaaj" ko nirupit karne ke liye german shabd "bürgerliche Gesellschaft" kaa prayog kiya - ek aisa kshetra jo naagarik samhita dwaara viniyamit ho
 For Hegel, civil society is attested by conflicting forces
 poonjivadi hiton ke daayre main hone ke naate, uske antargat sangharsh or asamantaaon kii sambhaavna he
 Therefore, continuous monitoring of the state is necessary to maintain moral order in the society
 hegel ne rajya ko naitik jivan kaa sarvocch swaroop mana
 isliye, raajnneetik raashtra ke paas naagarik samaaj ke dosha ko sudhaarney kii kshamta or adhikaar he
 Alexis de Torquille, after comparing autocratic France and democratic America, attempted to disprove Hegel's assertion by emphasizing the system of civil and political associations as a counterbalance to both the nation's liberal individualism and centralization
 isliye, hegel kii saamaajik satta kii dharna kaa toqueville dwaara saamaanya rup se anukaran kiya gaya, jisane raajnneetik samaaj or naagarik samaaj ke bich bhed dikhalaayaa
 Karl Marx took this subject forward
 For Marx, civil society was the 'foundation' where productive forces and social relations were taking place, whereas political society was an 'external framework'
 poonjeevaad or naagarik samaaj ke bich kii kadi se sahmati jataate hue, marks kaa maananaa tha ki naagarik samaaj puunjipati varg ke hiton kaa pratinidhitiv karata he 
 isliye, bahari dhaanche ke rup main raashtra pramukh varg ke hiton kaa bhi pratinidhitiv karata he; poonjeevaad ke antargat, yah puunjipati varg ke varchasv ko banaae rakhata he
 Therefore, Marx disapproved of the positive role of the nation presented by Hegel
 marks ne tark diya ki raashtra ek tatasth samasya kaa samaadhaan karne vaala nahin ho saktaa
 balki, usne raashtra ko puunjipati varg ke hiton ke rakshak ke rup main darshaya
 usne raashtra or naagarik samaaj ko puunjipati varg ke kaaryakari haath mana; isliye donon tiraskrit hone chahie 
 Antonio Gramsci corrected this negative view of civilized society
 To some extent, away from Marx's point, Gramsci did not consider civil society to be attached to the socio-economic basis of the nation
 Rather, Gramsci found the political structure situated in civil society
 unhone poonjeevaad ke aadhipaty ke astitv ke liye apekshit saanskrithik or vaicharik puunji ke yogadanakarta ke rup main naagarik samaaj kii mahatvapurn bhoomika ko rekhaankit kiya 
 ise ek samasya ke rup main prastut karne ke bajaay, vigat marxvaadi avadharanaon kii bhaanti, gramski ne naagarik samaaj ko samasya sulajhane vaale ke rup main dekha
 gramski se sahmati jataate hue, nav vampanthi ne raashtra or bazaar ke khilaaf logon ke bachaav main tathaa raashtra ko prabhavit karne ke liye loktantric sankalp ko banaae rakhane main naagarik samaaj ko mahatvapurn bhoomika nirdhaarit kii 
 isi samay, nav-udaaravaadi vichaarkon ne communist or sattavadi shashan ko hataane ke liye sangharsh sthal mana 
 is prakaar, naagarik samaaj shabd kaa nav-vamapanthiyon or nav udaarvaadiyon ke raajnneetik bhaashan main ek mahatvapurn sthaan he
 The postmodern method of understanding civil society first developed in the 1980s by political opposition in the former Soviet bloc East European countries
 us samay se raajnneetik kshetra ke bheetar raajnneetik samaaj ke bajaay naagarik samaaj ke vichaar ke upyog kaa abhyaas upja
 haalanki, 1990 ke dashak main vaishvik paimaane par gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon or nae saamaajik andolanon ke udbhav ke saath, tisare kshetra ke rup main sabhy samaaj 'ek vaikalpik saamaajik or vishwa vyavastha' ke nirmaan ke liye samrik karrwai kaa mahatvapurn ilaaka ban gaya
 Subsequently, the postmodern application of the idea of civil society, apart from a glut of definitions - was divided into two major parts: as a political society and as a third sector

 badale main isaki vajah se naagarik samaaj ke liye vyaavhaarik parivartan karnaa padaa jisane saidhantik bahes ko prabhavit kiya
 Initially the new ban imposed more emphasis on 'civil society' as a panacea, replacing the nation's service provision and social care, with Hulm and Edward suggesting that it is now referred to as a 'magic bullet' Is being seen in kuch vikasshil raajnneetik vaigyanikon ne chetaya ki is drushtikon ne nae khatre paidaa kiye hai
 For example, in 'let Us Get Civil Society Straight', Whites argued that the often politicized and potentially divisive nature of civil society is being ignored by some policy makers
 1990 ke ant tak naagarik samaaj ko bhumandalikaran virdohi andolan kii vruddhi or kai deshon ke loktantr main parivartan ke bich rambaan ke rup main kam dekha jane laga, iske sthaan par naagarik samaaj se apni vaidhata or loktantric pratyaayakon ke auchity ko siddh karne ke liye adhikadhik maang kii jane lagi

 aadhunikottar sabhy samaaj siddhant ab kaaphi had tak ek tatasth rukh par laut aayaa he, lekin samrudh samaajon main is tathy ke adhyayan or vikasshil rashtron main sabhy samaaj par lekhan ke bich suspasht matbhed he
 Civil society in both areas, however, is often seen as a balance and complement to an alternative in relation to the nation, or, as Whites stated in his 1996 article, 'the nation as a precondition of civil society Is seen loktantric samaaj or raajnneetik samaaj ke bich sambandhon par sahitya kii jaden alexis di toqueville jaise praarambhik udaaravaadi lekhan main jami hui hai
 But they were particularly developed by 20th century theorists such as Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba, who considered the role of political culture important in a democratic system
 unhone tark diya ki kai svaichhik sanghathanon ke raajnneetik tatv behatar jaagrukta or adhik jaankaar naagarik taiyaar karte hai, jo parinamswaroop behatar tareeqe se matdaan kaa chayan karte hai, raajnneeti main bhaag lete hai or sarkaar ko adhik javabdeh banaate hai
 The statutes of these organizations are often considered to be micro-constitutions because they make participants attuned to the formalities of democratic decision making
 haal hi main, robert di
 putanaam ne tark diya he ki naagarik samaaj main gaiyr raajnneetik sanghathan bhi loktantr ke liye mahatvapurn hai
 This is because they create social capital, trust, shared values, which are transferred to the political arena and help to keep the society together by facilitating an understanding of the interconnectedness of the society and its vested interests
 tathaapi, anya logon ne jaananaa chaha he ki vastav main loktantric sabhy samaaj kaisaa he
 Some have noted that civil society actors have now gained significant amounts of political power, without any direct selection or appointment
 parth chatarji ne tark diya he ki, duniya ke adhikansh hisson main, "sabhy samaaj jansankhya kii drushti se simit he
 "according to Jai Sen, civilized society is a neo-colonial project run by the global elite for self-interest

 Governments have displayed different viewpoints and have implemented diverse policies directed towards civil society and organizations and their creators
 kuch sattavadi sarkaron ne adhikansh raajnneetik or saamaajik adhikaar kaaryakarta sanghathanon ko pratibandhit kiya he or naagarik jivan keval un samoohon ke liye maujuud he jo sthapit vyavastha ke liye koi chunauti prastut nahin karte
 sanyukt rajya america main, "rashtriya suraksha ke sangrakshan, hinsa kii rokthaam or maujuuda saamaajik or raajnneetik vyavastha ke anurakshan" ke kathith uddeshy se sarkaar ne agrani sanghathanon or mahatvapurn saamaajik andolanon ko badnaam or bhang karne ke liye abhiyaan chalaae hai
 For example, COINTELPRO was a decade-long FBI program that used psychological warfare, unfair incarceration, illegal violence, and murder and other techniques against organizations and individuals in the Women's Movement, Civil Rights Movement, Native American Movement, and anti-war movements
 
 samprati aalochak or kaaryakarta aksar bhumandalikaran ke khilaaf sangrakshan kii zarurat vaale saamaajik jivan ke kshetra or unke prati pratirodh sroton ke liye sabhy samaaj shabd lagu karte hai, kyonki yah seemaa se pare or vibhinn kshetron ke aar-paar kaam karata nazar aata he
 However, subject to various definitions, this experiment, funded and directed by businesses and institutions involved in civil society and supporting globalization, is controversial

 a few studies have also been published that deal with unresolved issues related to the use of the term in relation to the influence and ideological power of the international aid system
