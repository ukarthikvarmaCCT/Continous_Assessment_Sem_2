samvedansheel praaniyon ke maargdarshan ke liye swayan kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 " isi se judaa shaastra ratnagotra vibhaag, kahata he ki tathagatagarbha kii shikshaayen samvedansheel praaniyon ko jeetne kii drushti se or "swayan se judaav" ko samaapt karne ke liye he - gaiyr buddha shiksha kii paanch main se ek kami
 lankavatar sutara main yoru vaing ne bhi aisi hi bhashaa kaa prayog paaya he, phir likhte hai: "ye dekhte hue ki ye sandarbh aavashyak he
 This will prevent us from coming to the conclusion that from the idea of tathagatagarbha it was just a supernatural fantasy
 " haalanki, kuch logon ne mahaparinirvana sutara se jude is nishkarsh par aapatti kii he or daawa kiya he ki buddha ne in panktiyon main swayan kii vaastaviktaa par bal dete hue ghoshnaa kii he ki wo hi swayan hai: 'due to many reasons and circumstances, i also taught that myself is beyond myself
 jabaki vastav main swayan he, maine ye sikhaaya ki koi swayan nahin he lekin isamen kuch galat bhi nahin he
 Buddha-metal is self-contained
 jab tathagat ye shiksha dete hai ki koi swayan nahin he, to wo aisa anadi ke kaaran karte hai
 The Tathagata are themselves and they teach not to be themselves because they have attained sovereignty
 ' The Buddha in the Nirvana Sutra states that he will now teach the principles kept secret so far and his earlier teaching on non-self was based on justification
 dow kosho yamamoto likhte hai: 'he says that the non-self he taught earlier is nothing but justification in that context
 

unhone ye bhi bataaya ki ab wo gopneey gyaan ke bare main baat karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 The person also follows contrary thoughts
 to ab vah nirvana ke sakaaratmak gunon kii baat karenge, jo kuch or nahin balki shaashvat, harsh or shuddh hi hai
 ' kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar, tathagatagarbha prakruti ke sutron main jis bhashaa kaa prayog kiya gaya he unamem sakaaratmak bhashaa main ashrith utpatti se buddha shiksha par jor dikhataa he jisase log buddha dharm se dur na hone lag jaaen or is shiksha ko nihilism ke samaan na samaj baithen
 udhaaharan ke liye, kuch sutron main gaiyr-swayan ke purna gyaan ko hi sachcha swayan kaha gaya he; is path ke param lakshya ko phir kaaphi sakaaratmak bhashaa se samajhaayaa gaya he jo bharat ke darshan shaastra main upyog kii jaati rahi he, lekin ab ise nai buddha shabdaawalee kaa hissaa bana liya gaya jisase us vyakti ke bare main samajhaayaa ja sake jisane buddha path ko safaltaapurvak purna kar liya ho
 Dr
 Yamamoto explains that the 'positive' depiction of nirvana is in fact associated with a higher degree of nirvana - called 'mahanirvana'
 nirvana sutara ke 'bodhisattva mahaan paramatma raja' paath ke bare main baat karte hue yamamoto khud hi dharmagranth kaa sahaara lete hai: 'nirvana kya he? 


ye kuch isi prakaar he ki bhukhe vyakti ko wo shanti or harsh mil jaae jaise uske pet main kuch bhojan chalaa gaya ho
' yamamoto uddhran jari rakhte hai, saath hi apni tippanee bhi jodate hai: "but, such nirvana cannot be called" Mahanirvana "
 And he also contemplates "maha Swayam", "maha Harsha" and "maha Purity" which are the four qualities of Maha Nirvana like all Sanatana
 ' According to some scholars, the interpretation of "self" here and in related formulas does not in fact represent enough self
 darasal, yah ek sakaaratmak bhashaa main riktata kii abhivyakti he or buddha prathaon ke madhyam se buddhatv kii prapti kaa suchak he
 In this view the aim of 'tathagata Garbha' / Buddha's teaching is liberation-scriptural and not theoretical
 baharhaal, ye vyakhya vivaadaaspad he
 Not all scholars have this opinion
 nirvana sutara or sambandhit shastron main tathagatagarbha siddhant ke vividh gyaan par likhte hue, dow jemi habird kehete hai ki kis tarah kuch viddhan tathagatagarbha main param tatvvaad or advaitvaad kii prakruti kii taraf jhukaav pate hai 
 dow habird kii tippaniyan: 'matsumoto said that there are many similarities in the very positive language and motivational way of knowledge in the Tathagata Garbha
 saath hi unhen atman / brahman parampara main paryaapt advaitvaad dikhaa
 jaahir he, matsumoto ne hi sirf is samanta kaa ullekh kiya he, aisa nahin he
 For example, Takasaki Jikido, who is considered a scholar of the Tathagatagarbha tradition, saw Advaitaism in the doctrines of the Tathagatagarbha and Mahayana 


 Obermiller in his translation linked the notion of the Advaita supreme principle to the Tathagatagarbha tradition and commented on the Ratnagotra
 , Which he aptly named as "the Manual of Buddhist Monotheism"
 

lamote or frowalnar ne tathagatagarbha siddhant ko madhyamika se thik ulat bataaya or unhone use atman / brahman ke advaitvaad se judaa hua bataaya, jabaki nagaao, sefort royag or jonston jaise kuch logon ne sirf apane andeh jaahir kiye or kaha ki ye vedon ke samay ke baad ke advaitvaad se mail khaataa he
 Another view, represented by Yamaguchi Susumu and his student Ogawa Ichijo, succeeded in understanding Tathagatagarbha without Vedic ideas and found it only in the Buddhist tradition of emptiness and causality that outrightly rejects any monotheism
 
 jaahir he, tathagatagarbha or buddha parampara kii advaitvaad yaa shaashvat prakruti se jude prashn jatil hai
 Dr
 Hubbard summarizes his research on the principles of Tathagatagarbha with these words: 'tathagatagarbha kaa gyaan hameshaa se hi bahes kaa mudda he, kyonki vah satya or gyaan ke liye behad moulik sakaaratmak drushtikon rakhata he, vaastaviktaa kaa varnan nakaaratmak sandarbh main nahin yani jo usamen kami he yaa riktata he uske sandarbh main nahin, balki sakaaratmak varnan jaisaa ' According to Paul Williams, congruence can be explained in monotheism of Atman / Brahmin thought
 jab nirvana sutara gaiyr buddha saadhuon ko jeetne ke liye apni shiksha saamne rakhe: At this time there is something interesting about the Hindu influence on Buddhism
 lekin sirf prabhaavon kii baat karnaa behad aasaan he
 

 Saying this, the Mahaparinirvana Sutra itself assumes a kind of Hindu influence, when it speaks of the Buddha using 'himself' to conquer non-buddhist monks
 phir bhi, ye sochna galat hoga ki advait vedant ke utkrisht swayan brahman is samay buddha dharm ko prabhavit karte hai
 It is not clear anywhere that the self which means in the Mahaparinirvana Sutra can be compared to the Advaita Brahman anywhere and this Tathagatagarbha Sutra is older than the Gaud verse, which is called the founder of Hindu Advaitaism
 sutara ye bhi kahata he ki buddha kii prakruti vastav main swarahit he, lekin baatcheet ke aadhaar par ye swayan kehalaati he
 In the second section of the same sutra, it is stated that there are three ways by which a person can "get" something; Achieve in the past, achieve in the present and achieve in the future
 It states that "all have the nature of Buddha" means that all will become Buddha in future 

 However, Dozen has clearly stated that the nature of Buddha is present in some contexts even in the present -also in Buddhism: Actually comparing reality with the present, it was linked to Buddha nature, which included grass, trees, mind and body all
 dojan ke liye kisi bhi vastu ko dekhnaa athwa buddha kii prakruti ko dekhnaa he
 Whereas Chinul believes that it exists in the body like the ability to smell and see
 mahatvapurn lankavatar sutara main kaha gaya he ki sabhi kaary buddha kii prakruti ke kaaran hai, har karm kii niyati yahi kaaran or jad he
 As suggested above, the Japanese Zen Guru Dozen has a completely different interpretation of Buddha nature, in which the 'whole form' is seen as Buddha nature and nothing is different from it
 The nature of Buddha is not just about 'ability to be Buddha', but it is the nature of everything in the world
 sabhi vasteen apane asthayitv main buddha prakruti kii tarah dekhi gai hai or wo kisi buddha prakruti ke liye 'kshamta' kaa pramaan nahin he
 Dr
 Masao Abe writes on this understanding: '


 dojan kii samaj main, buddha prakruti kisi kshamta kaa pramaan nahin, wo koi beej nahin he jo har samvedansheel vyakti ke paas ho
 balki har samvedansheel vyakti, yaa kahen har vastu, jivit yaa mrit asal main buddha prakruti hi he
 This is not an ability which will show form in future, this is the basic nature of everything
 dojan ne is tarah buddha prakruti or 'samvedansheel vyaktiyon' ke vichaar ke daayre ko badhaate hue, lagbhag sari chizon ko samet liya, wo sari chijen jo jivit hai, jinamein buddhi he or jo buddha prakruti hi hai
 Dr
 Masao Abeis explains: '


 dojan ne na sirf buddha prakruti ke arth kaa dayera badhaayaa he, balki samvedansheel vyaktiyon ko bhi vrihadata pradaan kii he
 In "busho", "the whole personality is the nature of the Buddha
" " ye kehane ke fouran baad wo kehete hai, "main sampurna vyakti kii 'samvedansheel praaniyon' kii ikai ko avibhajya maanata hum"


 yani dojan ne shujo kaa dayera badha diya he, jo paaramparik rup se keval jivit yaa samvedshansheel vyaktiyon ke liye upyog main laayaa jaataa tha, ab isamen mrit or asamvedansheel vasteen bhi shaamil hai
 In other words, he has spoken of giving life in dead objects, giving feelings in insensitive things and finally giving Buddha and Buddha nature in all
 '
 In Jainism this means opening the last bond of karma
 When an enlightened human being such as an Arihant or Tirthankara destroys his remaining abrasive deeds / Ahagatya Karma thus ending his earthly existence, then this stage is called Nirvana
 takneekee taur par, ek arihant ke sharir ko tyaag dene ko athwa unke sharir kii mrityu ko nirvana kaha jaataa he, kyonki unhone sansar main apane astitv ko samaapt karke mukti ko paa liya he
 Moksha means liberation after liberation
 nirvana kii prapti ke baad ek arihant siddh ban jate hai, ek mukt vyakti
 Nirvana in Jainism means: jain dharm ko maanane vaale diwaali ko 24wein tirthankar mahavir bhagwaan ke nirvana kalyanak diwas ke rup main manaate hai
 Nirvana Day is described as 'nirvana Kalyanak Divas' in Jainagam
 shwetambar manyata anusaar kalpasutra main mahavir ke nirvana par vistrut jaankaree he
 According to Shwetambara belief, it has been told in the Uttaradhana Sutra that how Gautama explained the meaning of Nirvana to KC, who was a disciple of the latter

 Tomar or Tanwar was a Rajput forest of Northwest India
 tomaro kaa maananaa he ki ve chandravanshi he
 He founded the present Delhi with the name of Dihilika
 puraanon se prathit hota he ki aarambh main tomaron kaa nivas himalay ke nearesth kisi uttari pradesh main tha
 But by the 10th century they had reached Karnal
 thaneshwar main bhi inkaa rajya tha
 At that time there was a kingdom of Kanyakubaj Rajput kingdoms in northern India
 unheen ke samant ke rup main tanwaron ne dakshin kii ore agrasar hona armbh kiya
 The timing of his authority in Delhi is uncertain
 kintu vikram kii 10veen or 11veen shatiyon main hamen sambhars ke chouhanon or tomaron ke sangharsh kaa ullekh miltaa he
 Tomresh Rudra Chauhan was killed at the hands of King Chandan
 tantrapal tomars chouhan vaakpati se parajeet hua
 Singharaj, the son of Vakpati, killed Tomresh Salvan
 kintu chouhan singhraj bhi kuch samay ke baad maaraa gaya
 It is possible that the Tomars had some involvement in the death of Singharaj
 aisa prathit hota he ki tomars is samay dilli ke swami ban chuke the
 The 12 villages of Tanwar Rajput are in the vicinity of Delhi Fatehpur The Tomar dynasty of delhi-thaneshwar was in a fairly advanced state during the initial invasions of Ghaznavi dynasty
 tomarsraj ne thaneshwar ko mahmud se bachaane kaa praytn bhi kiya, yadhyapi use safalataa na mili
 In 1038 AD Mahmud's son Masood took over Hansi
 masood ke putr majdood ne thaneshwar ko hastgat kiya
 Preparations were started to attack Delhi
 aisa prathit hota tha ki musalmaan dilli rajya kii samaapti kiye bina chaiyn na lenge
 But the Tomars acted with courage
 tomarsraj mahipal ne keval haansi or thaneshwar ke durg hi hastgat na kiye; uski vir vahini ne kongde par bhi apni vijayadhvaja kuch samay ke liye fahraa di
 Lahore also survived fortunately
 tomaron kii is vijay se keval vidveshagni hi bhadki
 Tomars were attacked from here and there
 tanwaron ne inkaa yathashakti uttar diya
 From the Parshaanatharcharita of Sridhar Kavi, composed in Samvat 1189, it appears that the capital of the Tomars at that time was Delhi's prosperous city and Tanvaraj Anangpal was famous everywhere due to his bravery and qualities
 dwitiya anangpal ne mehroli ke louh stambh kii dilli main sthapana kii
 It was probably during this king that the towers changed their policy
 bisaldev tritiy na sanwat 1208 main tomaron ko haraa kar dilli par adhikaar kar liya
 After this, Tanwar ruled as the feudatories of the Chauhans in Delhi
 prithviraj chouhan kii paraajay ke baad dilli par musalamaanon kaa adhikaar hua
 During the time of Ferozeshah Tughlaq, Gwalior was ruled by another branch of Tanwar
 isane yahan lagbhag 150 varsh tak rajya kiya
 Tanvaraj Ramsah fought in favor of Maharana Pratap along with his two sons in the famous battle of Haldighati
 gwalior ke tanwaron ne kala, sahitya or samskruti ke sarankshan kaa paryaapt kaary kiya he
 a branch of Tanwar established its rule in Patan in northern Rajasthan, which was a part of Jaipur state
 ye ab 'tanvarwati' kehalaata he or vahaan tanwaron ke thikaane hai
 The main place is of Patan
 ek shakha chambal kshetra main gai jahaan tomars rajputo kii basaapat 1400 gaanv main he
 This region is called Tanwarghar
 is shakha ne kai sadi gwalior par raaj kiya
 Tomar / Tanwar are still found in large numbers in western Uttar Pradesh and Haryana where Tomaro was ruled
 pashchimi uttar pradesh main ghaziabad jile main pilkhuva ke paas tomars 84 gaanv he
 Among them are Duhri, Galand, Mukimpur Garhi who participated in the revolution of 1857 and many people were martyred here
 yahan duhari gaanv bahut hi zyada sakasham gaanv he gadhmukteshwar ke paas tomaro ke 42 gaanv he
 Bhadrasen, a son of Rajput king Anangpal, came here and conquered the region from Ahiro and settled a village called Bhadsyana, which has brought many villages like Bhaina, Dholpur, Lisadi, which number 42 today
 meerut ke paas bhi tomaro ke 12 gaanv he jisame sisouli, mau khaas, panchagaanv ,bhagwanpur pramukh he
 In Bulandshahar district, there are 24 villages of Tomaro between Gulavathi and Secunderabad, in which Baral is the chief
 khurja ke paas bhi dharpa jaise 5 gaanv tomaro ke he
 Janghara, a branch of the Tomars, is also found in western Uttar Pradesh, whose history is very glorious and who for a long time confronted the Muslim rulers in today's Rohilkhand and did not let them sit peacefully
 dilli ke patan ke baad kuch tomars rohillakhand main aae or ahiron ko bhagaakar apana raaj sthapit kiya
 Janghara means hungry for war
 ye bahut ladaaka vansh he isliye iskaa naam janghara padaa
 Janghara Bareilly, Shahjahanpur, Badaun, Etah, Farrukhabad are found in large numbers
 aligarh main bhi janghara ke 42 gaanv he

 iske alaava agra, firojabad aadi jilo main bhi tomars acchhee sankhya main milte he
 a large number of tanvars are also found in Bhiwani region in Haryana, which are called Jatu Tanwar

 On July 10, 2017, terrorists attacked the group of pilgrims going to the Shravan Yatra of Hindu pilgrimage Amarnath, located in the state of Jammu and Kashmir of North India
 islamic aatankwaadi sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyaba ke dwaara kiye gayi is aatanki akraman main 7 shraddhaluon kii mrityu hui thi
 India alleges that lashkar-e-taiba terrorist Ismail is the main accused in this attack
 parantu pakistan main sthit islamic aatankwaadi sanghathan lashkar e taiyaba ne is akraman kaa daayitv sweekaar nahin kiya
 The attack was made in Anantnag district on 10 July 2017 and accordingly on the first Monday of the month of Shravan

 It is said in the account that at this time Guruji was interviewed by God
 un par ishwar kii krupa hui thi or devi anukampaa ke pratik rup main ishwar ne guruji ko ek amrit kaa pyaalaa pradaan kiya tha
 There is a witness in the accounts that with the inspiration of this supernatural experience, Guruji pronounced the Mantmantra, from which the Japuji Sahib begins
 japuji kaa praarambhik shabd ek omkari beej mantra he jaise upanishdon or gita main om shabd beej mantra he
 The basic mantra is, in which the attributes of the Lord are mentioned
 samast japuji ko mote taur par chaar bhaagon main vibhakt kiya gaya he- In the first seven, the problem of soul-searching spirituality is explained
 aglaa bhaag pathakon ko uttarottar saadhan path kii ore agrasar karata jaataa he, jab tak ki jeevatma ko mahaan satya kaa saakshaatkaar nahin ho jaataa
 The third part describes the mental trends and vision of a person who has tasted the taste of spirituality
 antim bhaag main samast sadhana kaa saar prastut kiya gaya he, jo swayan main atyadhik moolyawaan he, kyonki is bhaag main satya or shaashvat satya, sadhana path kii ore, unmukh manansheel aatma kaa aadhyatmik vikaas ke charnon kaa pratyaksh varnan kiya gaya he
 Japuji is a unique literary work along with the spiritual voice of Shri Guru Nanak
 isaki prashnottaree style pathak ke bhaavon par amit chhap chhoti he
 In this, Guruji himself has addressed them in a meticulous manner by mentioning questions or apprehensions of the curious mind
 isamen andeh nahin ki japuji ek darshanik or vichaar pradhan kriti he or isaki rachana guruji kii anya vaani kii bhanti raagon ke anusaar nahin kii gai he
 But still many verses have been used in it
 isamen mukhya chand, doha, chaupai tathaa naatak aadi hai
 There is a shloka at the beginning and end of japuji
 japuji ke pehle charan kii pehali teen panktiyon kaa tukant ek he or usamen aage teen panktiyon kaa alag
 'an Onkar 


' is Prasadi Praise
 'aadi sach


 hi bhi sach' bhi mantra swaroop vaartakamayi stuti he
 Like the rhyme, the rhyme of the rows is found from the middle
 jaise Similarly, it can be said that Gurunanak started expressing ideas in the form of a pouche
 kuch shabdon main baar-baar dohraane se bhi sangeetmayi lay utpann ho gai he
 For example, in the third phase, repeated words of 'gave Ko' have been used very briefly in the sutra style
 is sankshiptata tathaa sanyam ke liye roopak kaa prayog aksar hota he
 The metaphor has been used mostly in Japuji
 jaise- The metaphor of the goldsmith shop in the last phase of Japuji reveals the means of man's virtuous life and self-progress
 isi tarah sharir ko 'kapakahana jisamen sharir kaa naash tathaa phir navaroop dhaaran karne kii prakriya jaan pati he
 'aap bje aaphe khahu' explains the action principle of farming life
 'mati vichi ratna jawahar maanik' main manushya ke gun aadi ko ratna, jawahar tathaa moti kaha he
 By saying 'asankh Sura Muh Bharva Saar', he has given the vision of the compulsion of the spiritual warrior who keeps facing his attacks in the field of religion
 'santokh thapi rakhiya jini suti' kahkar sansar ke niyambaddh hone kaa bhed samajha diya he
 Just as all the beads are threaded in the sutra, similarly the whole world is threaded in a thread like santokh rule
 beesvin paumen buddhi kii shuddhta ke liye bahut alankrita vaani main man ko sristi ke darshan ko samajhaayaa gaya he
 Guru Nanak was a folk teacher
 isiilie unhone ishwariya sandesh ko jan-jan tak pahunchaane ke liye japuji main lokbhasha kaa hi sarvaadhik upyog kiya
 The language of 'japuji' can be called the saint language of that time, which has a mixture of Braj language
 japuji ke rachanakaal main sanskrit ke shabdon ko punjabi yaa tadbhav rup main likhaa jaataa tha
 Some words in Japuji are also in the corresponding form of arabic-persian
 jaise-pir, paro, darbar, kudarat, hukmadi
 Most forms have been taken, such as wages, nandri, kagad etc
 iske atirikt yogiyon kii vishesh prakaar kii shabdaawalee punjabi rup main pau28 or 29 main milti he
 'japuji' is in Guruvani who spoke Guru Nanak, though he did not invent the letters
 apni vishisht bhashaa or shashakt style ke madhyam se guruji ne 'japuji' main sarvocch satya or uski sanathan khoj sambandhi ucch bauddhik evam amoort vichaaron ko spasht evam shashakt rup main abhivyakt kiya he
 According to Vinobaji's statement, doing so was Guru Nanak's ideal
 'jiv hove farmaanu' ke bhav kii vyakhya karte hue unhone likhaa he mujhe lagata ki yahan sanskrit or arabi donon arth lekar shabdon kii rachana kii he
 After all, Guruji wanted both Hindus and Muslims, wanted to do 'sagal Jasmati'

 Thousands of years ago, when the ancestors of the Native American tribals arrived in North America from Siberia, they found the mastodon there

 The Compton effect is an interaction with a substance of high frequency electromagnetic radiation in which the energy of the photons is degraded by increasing free electrons and their wave amplitude increases
 prakirnit vikiran kii tarangadairghy keval prakirnan ke kone par nirbhar karti he
 In order to clarify the Compton effect, in 1923 AD, Compton and Debai independently adopted the notion that the total energy / momentum in the photon moving in a direction yaa keval thodaa sa bhaag par de saktaa he
 This causes the energy of the observed photon, which has a Planck constant, and the frequency of radiation, to be less than the incident photon's energy and increases the wavelength related to the photon
 spashtat: yah photaan-electron-takkar-praturup vikiran ke tarang siddhanth ke ekadam pratikul he
 In 1924, Burr, Kremers, and Slater suggested another model that was based on waveism
 is praturup main urjasthirataa or samvegasthirataa ke niyam vikiran or electron kii kisi ekaaki ant: kriya main lagu na hokar anek takkaron ke sankhyikeey madhya par hi lagu hote hai
 Therefore, the incident radiation is continuously scaled to correspond to the wavelength model of Tamson, but sometimes a reflect electron also emits from the scatter

 Using the energy and stability of momentum in the Kapton – Debai photon model, a precise relationship is found in the directions of the reflected electron and the dispersed photon
 aadhunik prayogon se is sambandh kii santoshjanak pushti hoti he
 According to Dirac's theories of quantum mechanics, the interaction between an electromagnetic field and an electron has been explained completely differently
 is praturup main ant: kriya kii praarambhik or antim sthitiyon ke atirikt ek madhyam sthiti bhi hoti he, jisamen keval samveg hi sthir rahata he, urja nahin
 In this internal state an electron can emit a photon or absorb a photon
 at: kaanpton parinaam main do vikalpon kii shakyata he : By considering both of these options, the scattering of electromagnetic radiation of electrons has been studied and the conclusions drawn from it have been proved by modern experiments to be sufficient for the expansion of energy
 kaanpton-debaai ke nishkarsh is saamaanya nishkarshon ke vishesh rup he
 If we consider the electrons to be completely independent and stable in the dislocated material and if the incident photon has energy and the dislocated photon has energy, then using the laws of energy stability and momentum stability we get the following equations: jahaan h⁄mec is called the Compton wavelength of the electron; Its value is equal to 2

 sabhi tom and jeri katha-prasangon kii suchi ke liye tom and jeri ankon kii suchi dekhen
 The plot of each short film is usually based on Tom's numerous attempts to capture Jerry and the resulting scuffle and devastation
 kyonki tom kabhi-kabhaar hi jeri ko khaane kaa prayaas karata he or chunki kuch cartoon laghu-filmon main yah jodi vastav main ek duusare ke saath acchhee tarah nibaah karte dikhaai dete hai, isliye yah abhi tak aspasht he ki akhir kyon tom, jeri kaa itnaa adhik peechha karata he
 Some of the reasons presented are general cunning / hatred for rats, duty as ordered by his boss, attempts by Jerry to spoil the tasks assigned to Tom, Jerry eating Tom's owner's food, which is assigned to Tom, a sense of revenge, Jerry's avoidance of Tom's other potential victims, competition with another cat and Tom's clever siren cats
 To attempts to Kane, who does Jerry hatred or jealousy, among other reasons
 jeri kii chaalaaki, dhoort kshamtaayen or qismat kii vajah se tom shaayad hi kabhi jeri ko pakadaney main safal ho paata he
 Interestingly, in many title cards, Tom and Jerry are shown smiling at each other, implying a love-wrangling relationship rather than the sheer annoyance displayed on each other in each cartoon
 cartoonon main aise kai drushtaant hai, jahaan ve sachhee dosti tathaa ek duusare kii bhalaai ke prati chintaa jataate hai 
 Some of the short film's marks are famous for some of the loud jokes invented in theater animations: Jerry's chopping Tom, slamming his head into a window or door, Tom's ax, pistol, explosives, traps, and poison Trying to assassinate Jerry, tuck Tom's tail in waffle iron, push him into the refrigerator, hook his tail into an electric socket, snag him, stick or big hammer Taking it vigorously, dropping it to the ground with a tree or an electric pole, sticking a matchstick in its feet and burning them, etc

 In a recurring joke, Jerry kills Tom when he is thinking, where Tom initially does not feel the pain - and moments later he feels pain and vice versa; In another gag, Jerry stops Tom in the middle of the chase, before Tom can do something, he injures him
 cartoon, aparivartit rup par apni nirbharta ke liye bhi ullekhneey he, jaise visphot ke baad kirdaaron ko kaala kar dena or baari tathaa vishaal parachhaaiyon kaa prayog 
 The resemblance to everyday happenings and events is surely the highlight of the comic scenes in this series

 Prior to 1954, all Tom and Jerry cartoons were produced in valid Academy proportions and formats; And from late 1954 to 1955 some cartoons were produced in both the Academy format and the widescreensynmascope process

 Sometimes, often ironically, the two are defeated, especially when Jerry's last trap of impressing Tom potentially turns him on
 yaa jab jeri khadedate hue ant main kisi chiz ko upekshit kar detaa he
 Sometimes, the two eventually become friends
 donon kirdaar parapidak pravritiyon kaa pradarshan karte hai, jisamen ve ek duusare ko pareshaan karne kaa mazaa uthaate hai
 However, on the basis of the cartoon, whenever one character is threatened with death, Vivek awakens in the other and saves him
 kabhi-kabhi, ve kisi apriy anubhav ke parinamswaroop paraspar bhaawanaaon se jud jate hai or unka ek duusare par waar, gambhir hamale se zyaada sirf ek khel hota he
 Many of the short films have been shown to be quite easily interwoven and when the situation demands, beyond the expectation, they both have the ability to work together, often against another party, who torture them both And manages to degrade them

 The only other common accentuation Tom does is when an external element claims a scenario or probable event to be impossible, which is essentially, ironically to thwart Tom's plans - at which point , Lathera and Shattered Tom appear and the ghostly, echoing says "don't You Believe It!", Which was taken from some of the famous World War II promotional films of the 1940s

 Often Spike spoke using the voice and gestures of comedian Jimmy Durant
 itane saalon main spike kaa kot bhura or halke gulabi rang main badla he
 The entry of Spike's son Tyke in the late 1940s led to both a slight softening of Spike's character and a temporary new theater series

 In the late 1930s William Hanna and Joseph Barbara were members of the Rudolf Ising Unit of MGM Cartoon Studios

 Hanna and Barbara held a competition inside the studio to give the pair a new name, to suggest something different
 Animator John Carr won $ 40 for his suggested Tom and Jerry
 1941 main da midnite snacks ke saath tom and jeri kaa nirmaan shuru ho gaya or hanna tathaa barbara ne MGM main kaarykaal ke dauraan apane billi or chuuhe ke cartoonon ke alaava shaayad hi kisi or kaa nirdesan kiya ho
 Tom's physical appearance evolved over the years

 In contrast, Jerry's design was basically the same throughout the series

 Although the plot of each short film is virtually the same - where the cat chases the mouse - Hannah Barbara eventually made several changes to the theme

 Tom and Jerry won more Academy Awards than any other character-based theater animated series
 yahaan tak ki 1950 dashak main jab bajet kam hota gaya or laghu-filmon kii gati kuch dhimi ho gai, tab bhi tom and jeri apane theatre main mul pradarshan ke dauraan lokapriy rahe
 But, after television became popular in the 1950s, box office revenues of films and shorts appearing in theaters declined
 Prior to this, MGM attempted to grapple with the complete cinemascope production of the series
 baad main jab MGM ko ehsaas hua ki unke dwaara dubaara pradarshit puraani laghu-filmon se aay, nai filmon ke baraabar hi thi, to studio ke karypalkon ne anemation studio ko band karne kaa nirnay liya, jisane karmchaariyon ko aashcharya main daal diya
 In 1957, MGM Cartoon Studio was closed and the last of the 49 Tom and Jerry short films by Hanna and Barbara appeared on Taut Watchers on 1 August 1958

 In 1960, MGM decided to produce new Tom and Jerry shorts, and producer William L
 An agreement was signed between Cinder and animation director Jean Deich and his studio Rembrandt Films to produce films in Prague, Czechoslovakia
 The Ditch / Cinder team made 13 short films, many of which had surrealist qualities
 chunki dich / cinder dal ne tom and jeri kii mul laghu-filmein bahut hi kam dekhi thim, parinamtah bani filmein chalan ke viruddh or kai myanon main betuki maani gayi

 The first of Jean Deitch's short films, Switching Kitten, had indiscriminate pictorial errors, framed mistakes and incisive, somber music and sound effects that made the short-film virtually non-watchable
 These problems were never solved, and it is still widely regarded as an extremely useless Tom and Jerry short
 tom ke prashansakon ne jeri dwaara tom se kabhi bhaybheet na hone ke kaaran, dich ke cartoonon kii aalochana kii
 Mostly, Tom tries to hurt him only when he comes in his way
 tom kaa nayaa maalik, ek sthulkaay shwaat purush tha, jise maimi shoes ke tulana main tom kii galtiyon ko dandit karne main zyada krur dikhaaya gaya tha, jaise ki tom ko baar-baar peetna or danda se maarna, uske chehre ko gril se bhednaa or tom ko carbonated peya pine ke liye majaboor karnaa
 Surprisingly, the Tom and Jerry cartoons of Jeanne Ditch are still being shown on a semi-regular basis today

 1963 main shuru karte hue jones or goldman ne 34 se adhik tom and jeri laghu-filmon kaa nirmaan kiya, jin sab main jones kii vishisht style dekhne ko mili
 But, despite the same artists working with Jones at Warners who produced the animations, the critical success of these new short films remained in diverse categories
 jones ko apni style ke tom and jeri hasya qism ko apnaane main pareshaani hui or kai cartoonon main kathavstu kii apeksha mudraaen, vyaktitv or style ko tarjeeh mili

 Some of Jones's Tom and Jerry cartoons are reminiscent of his work with Wael E
 Coyote and The Road Runner, including the use of unconsciousness, in addition to the gags of characters falling from a height

 When Tom and Jerry were screened on terrestrial television in the United Kingdom, the cartoons were not edited due to the violence and allowed Mamie to remain
 In addition to being on a regular schedule, Tom and Jerry had another way of BBC Whenever the schedules started to deteriorate, the BBC would inevitably turn to Tom and Jerry to fill the vacancy, with the belief that it would otherwise flow to other channels This was particularly helpful in 1993, when the Knowles House party was postponed to the BBC Television Center over fears of an IRA bomb and in turn to fill the gap until the next show

 Due to the lack of dialogue, Tom and Jerry were also easily translated into various foreign languages
 1964 main tom and jeri kaa prasaaran japan main shuru hua
 TV in 2005 a nationwide survey conducted in Japan by Asahi, which included teenagers from the teens to the sixties, ranked Tom and Jerry at # 85 on the list of the Evergreen Top 100 "anime"; Whereas a web poll conducted after the list aired placed her at # 58 - the only non-japanese anime film on the list and animation besties such as Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, a Little Princess Sara, ultra-classics Macross, Ghost in The Shell, and Rourouni Kenshin

 There were at least twenty-four cartoons depicting racism or characters in black faces after the explosion that have been cut off when shown on television today, though depending on the country, The Yankee Doodle Mouse is a black-faced joke and safety
 At the end of seconds another black-faced dilemma remains intact

 Turner was dubbed again in the mid-1990s in hopes of making his voice less traditional; As a result, his accent began to sound more Irish
 Especially a cartoon, His Mouse Friday, is often completely out of television due to cannibals being portrayed as traditional racists

 In 2006, United Kingdom channel Boomerang planned to edit the Tom and Jerry cartoon aired in the UK, where characters were shown to be smoking in a way that seems "unseen, acceptable or seductive"
 iske liye ek darshak se shikaayat ai ki yah cartoon yuva darshakon ke liye upyukt nahin he or baad main UK media wachdog OFCOM ne iskaa nirikshan kiya
 This led to black-faced gimmicks being edited in the US as well, although these seem randomly cut off, as not all such scenes are cut
