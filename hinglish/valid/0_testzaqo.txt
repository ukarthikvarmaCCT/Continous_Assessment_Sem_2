 inaki kii mata kaa naam komaltammal or inke pita kaa naam shrinivas ayyangar tha
 His childhood was spent mainly in Kumbakonam, which is known for its ancient temples
 bachapan main ramanujan kaa bauddhik vikaas saamaanya baalkon jaisaa nahin tha
 He did not even learn to speak until he was three years old
 jab itani badi aayu tak jab ramanujan ne bolnaa aarambh nahin kiya to sabko chintaa hui ki kahin yah gunge to nahin hai
 In later years, when he entered school, he never felt in traditional education
 ramanujan ne das varshon kii aayu main primary pariksha main puure jile main sabase adhik ank praapt kiya or aage kii shiksha ke liye toun hiskool pahunche
 Ramanujan loved asking questions
 unke prashn adhyapakon ko kabhi-kabhi bahut atapate lagate the
 Like - who was the first man in the world? What is the distance between earth and clouds? Ramanujan's behavior was very sweet
 inkaa saamaanya se kuch adhik sthool sharir or jigyaasa se chamakati aakhen inhen ek alag hi pahchaan detii thim
 According to their classmates, their behavior was so gentle that no one could get angry with them
 vidhyalay main inaki pratibha ne duusare vidhyaarthiyon or shikshakon par chhap chhodana aarambh kar diya
 He had studied college level mathematics during his school time
 ek baar inke vidhyalay ke pradhanadhyaapak ne yah bhi kaha tha ki vidhyalay main hone vaali parikshaon ke maapdand ramanujan ke liye lagu nahin hote hai
 After passing the high school examination, he received a Subramanian scholarship for scoring good marks in Mathematics and English and also got admission for further college education
 aage ek pareshaani ai
 Ramanujan's love for mathematics had grown so much that he did not pay attention to other subjects
 yahaan tak kii ve itihaas, jeev vigyaan kii kakshaon main bhi ganit ke prashnon ko hal kiya karte the
 As a result, in the eleventh grade examination, he failed in all subjects except mathematics and as a result he stopped getting scholarship
 ek to ghar kii aarthik sthiti kharaab or upar se chaatravrutti bhi nahin mil rahi thi
 This was a very difficult time for Ramanujan
 ghar kii sthiti sudhaarney ke liye inhone ganit ke kuch tution tathaa khate-bahi kaa kaam bhi kiya
 Sometime later in 1907 Ramanujan again took the private examination of class XII and failed
 or isi ke saath inke paaramparik shiksha kii itishree ho gai
 The five years after leaving school were very frustrating for him
 bharat is samay paratantraa kii bediyon main jakadaaa tha
 There was severe poverty everywhere
 aise samay main ramanujan ke paas na koi naukari thi or na hi kisi santhaan athwa professor ke saath kaam karne kaa mauka
 His unwavering faith in God and deep reverence for mathematics always inspired him to follow the path of duty
 namgiri devi ramanujan ke parivaar kii isht devi thim
 Unwavering faith in him did not let him stay anywhere and he continued to conduct his research of mathematics even under such adverse circumstances
 is samay ramanujan ko tution se kul paanch rupaye masik milte the or isi main guzaara hota tha
 This life span of Ramanujan was full of grief and sorrow
 inhen hameshaa apane bharan-poshan ke liye or apni shiksha ko jari rakhane ke liye idhar udhar bhatakana padaa or anek logon se asafal yachana bhi kerani padi
 In the year 1908, his parents married him to a girl named Janaki
 vivaah ho jane ke baad ab inke liye sab kuch bhul kar ganit main doobana sambhav nahin tha
 Hence, he came to Madras in search of a job
 barahavin kii pariksha uteern na hone kii vajah se inhen naukari nahin mili or unka swasthya bhi buree tarah gir gaya
 Now on the advice of the doctor, he had to return to his home in Kumbakonam
 beemaari se thik hone ke baad ve waapas madras aae or phir se naukari kii talash shuru kar di
 Whenever he met someone, he used to show him a register of his own
 is register main inke dwaara ganit main kiye gaye saare kaary hote the
 At the same time, at the behest of someone, Ramanujan met Mr
 V
 Ramaswamy Iyer, the deputy collector there
 ayyar ganit ke bahut bade vidwaan the
 Here, Mr
 Iyer recognized the talent of Ramanujan and after asking District Magistrate Mr
 Ramchandra Rao, he also arranged a monthly scholarship of Rs
 25 for him
 is vritti par ramanujan ne madras main ek saal rahete hue apana pratham shodhpatr prakashit kiya
 The title of the research paper was "some properties of Bernoulli numbers" and this research paper was published in Journal of Indian Mathematical Society
 yahaan ek saal puraa hone par inhone madras port trust main clerk kii naukari kii
 Fortunately, there was not much work load in this job and here they used to get enough time for their mathematics
 yahaan par ramanujan raat bhar jaag kar nae-nae ganit ke sutara likhaa karte the or phir thodi der tak aaraam kar ke phir daftar ke liye nikal jate the
 Ramanujan used to write mathematics research on slate
 or baad main use ek register main likh lete the
 At night the sleep of other members of the family was disturbed due to the sound of Ramanujan's slate and pillar
 is samay bhartiya or pashchimi rahan sahan main ek badi duuri thi or is vajah se saamanytah bharatiyon ko angrej vaigyanikon ke saamne apane baton ko prastut karne main kaaphi sankoch hota tha
 The situation here was such that research work could not be carried forward without the help of an English mathematician
 is samay ramanujan ke puraane shubhachintak inke kaam aae or in logon ne ramanujan dwaara kiye gaye kaaryon ko landan ke prasiddh ganitagyon ke paas bheja
 But here they did not get any special help but one benefit was that people had come to know Ramanujan a little bit
 isi samay ramanujan ne apane sankhya siddhant ke kuch sutara professor sheshu ayyar ko dikhaae to unka dhyaan landan ke hi professor hardi kii taraf gaya
 Professor Hardy was one of the world's famous mathematicians of the time
 or apane sakht swabhaav or anushaasan priyata ke kaaran jane jate the
 After reading Professor Hardy's research work, Ramanujan said that he has found the answer to the unanswered question of Professor Hardy
 ab ramanujan kaa professor hardi se patravyavhaar aarambh hua
 From here on, a new era in Ramanujan's life began in which Professor Hardy had a very big role
 duusare shabdon main kaha jaae to jis tarah se ek johari heere kii pahchaan karata he or use taraash kar chamakaa detaa he, ramanujan ke jivan main vaisaa hi kuch sthaan professor hardi kaa he
 Professor Hardy was an admirer of Ramanujan's life and philosophy of life
 ramanujan or professor hardi kii yah mitrataa dono hi ke liye laabhprad siddh hui
 In a way, both of them worked complementary to each other
 professor hardi ne us samay ke vibhinn pratibhashali vyaktiyon ko 100 ke paimaane par aanka tha
 He gave 35 marks to most mathematicians and 60 marks to some specific persons
 lekin unhone ramanujan ko 100 main puure 100 ank die the
 Initially, when Ramanujan sent his research work to Professor Hardy, at first he did not even understand
 jab unhone apane mitra ganitagyon se salaah lee to ve is nishkarsh par pahunche ki ramanujan ganit ke kshetra main ek durlabh vyaktitv he or inke dwaara kiye gaye kaary ko thik se samajhane or usamen aage shodh ke liye unhen england aana chahie
 So he invited Ramanujan to come to Cambridge
 kuch vyaktigat kaarnon or dhan kii kami ke kaaran ramanujan ne professor hardi ke cambridge ke aamantran ko asweekaar kar diya
 Professor Hardy was disappointed by this but somehow decided to call Ramanujan there
 isi samay ramanujan ko madras vishvavidhyalay main shodh vritti mil gai thi jisase unka jivan kuch saral ho gaya or unako shodhakarya ke liye puraa samay bhi milane laga tha
 Meanwhile, after a long correspondence, slowly, Professor Hardy agreed Ramanujan to come to Cambridge
 professor hardi ke prayaason se ramanujan ko cambridge jane ke liye aarthik sahaayta bhi mil gai
 Ramanujan had written over 3000 new sources of mathematics in his notebook before leaving for England
 ramanujan ne landan kii dharti par kadam rakhaa
 Professor Hardy had already arranged for him there, so he did not face any particular problem
 england main ramanujan ko bas thodi pareshaani thi or iskaa kaaran tha unka sharmila, shant swabhaav or shuddh satvik jeevancharya
 Throughout his stay in England, he mostly cooked his own food
 england kii is yatra se unke jivan main krantikari parivartan aayaa
 He, along with Professor Hardy, published high-quality research papers
 apane ek vishesh shodh ke kaaran inhen cambridge vishvavidhyalay dwaara bi
e
 kii oopaadhi bhi mili
 But the climate and living style there was not very favorable to him and his health started deteriorating
 doctoron ne ise kshay rog bataaya
 At that time there was no tuberculosis medicine and the patient had to stay in the sanatorium
 ramanujan ko bhi kuch dinon tak vahaan rahanaa padaa
 Even at this time, he used to make new imaginations in the mathematical formulas
 iske baad vahaan ramanujan ko royal socity kaa phelo namit kiya gaya
 At a time when India was living in slavery, it was a great thing for a black person to get membership of the Royal Society
 royal socity ke puure itihaas main inase kam aayu kaa koi sadsy aaj tak nahin hua he
 His well-wishers celebrated and held gatherings all over India
 royal socity kii sadsyta ke baad yah triniti college kii fellowship paane vaale pehle bhartiya bhi bane
 Now it seemed that everything was going to a very good place
 lekin ramanujan kaa swasthya girtaa ja rahaa tha or ant main doctoron kii salaah par unhen waapas bharat lautnaa padaa
 On coming to India, he got a professor job at Madras University
 or ramanujan adhyaapan or shodh kaary main punah ram gaye
 Even after returning to India, health did not support them and the condition was getting serious
 is beemaari kii dasha main bhi inhone mock theta function par ek ucch stareey shodhpatr likhaa
 This function, propounded by Ramanujan, is used not only in mathematics but also in medical science to understand cancer
 inkaa girtaa swasthya sabake liye chintaa kaa vishay ban gaya or yahaan tak kii ab doctoron ne bhijawab de diya tha
 Finally, the moment of Ramanujan's departure arrived
 26 april1920 ke praatah kaal main ve achet ho gaye or dopaher hote hote unhone praan tyaag die
 At this time Ramanujan's age was only 33 years
 inkaa asamay nidhan ganit jagat ke liye apurnty kshati tha
 Whoever heard the news of Ramanujan's death in the whole country and abroad was shocked
 ramanujan or inke dwaara kiye gaye adhikansh kaary abhi bhi vaigyanikon ke liye abujh paheli bane hue hai
 In his journey to surprise the whole world by taking birth in a very common family, he gave India unprecedented glory
 inkaa unka vah purana register jis par ve apane prameya or sutron ko likhaa karte the 1976 main achaanak triniti college ke pustkaalay main mila
 This register of about one hundred pages remains a puzzle for scientists even today
 is register ko baad main ramanujan kii note book ke naam se janaa gaya
 It has also been published by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai
 ramanujan ke shodhon kii tarah unke ganit main kaam karne kii style bhi vicitra thi
 He sometimes woke up in the middle of the night by writing mathematics formulas on the slate and then falling asleep
 is tarah aisa lagata tha ki ve sapane main bhi ganit ke prashn hal kar rahe hon
 Along with Ramanujan's name, his Kuldevi is also taken
 inhone shunya or anant ko hameshaa dhyaan main rakhaa or iske antarsambandhon ko samajhane ke liye ganit ke sutron kaa sahaara liya
 There was a specialty of Ramanujan's work
 pehle ve ganit kaa koi nayaa sutara yaa prameny pehle likh dete the lekin uski upapatti par utana dhyaan nahin dete the
 When asked about this, he used to say that he received this sutra by the grace of Namagiri Devi
 ramanujan kaa aadhyatm ke prati vishwaas itnaa gaharaa tha ki ve apane ganit ke kshetra main kiye gaye kisi bhi kaary ko aadhyatm kaa hi ek ang maanate the
 He not only believed in religion and spirituality but also presented it logically
 ve kehete the ki "mere liye ganit ke us sutara kaa koi matlab nahin he jisase mujhe aadhyatmik vichaar na milte hon
 " ramanujan ne england main paanch varshon tak mukhyatah sankhya siddhanth ke kshetra main kaam kiya
 Ramanujan gave the following formula - is sutara kii visheshta yah he ki yah ganit ke do sabase prasiddh niyatankon kaa sambandh ek anant satat bhinn ke madhyam se vyakt karata he
 He also gave another formula for pie - 'ramanujan sankhya' us prakritik sankhya ko kehete hai jise do alag-alag prakaar se do sankhyaon ke ghanon ke yoga dwaara nirupit kiya ja saktaa he
 Example - 9 3 + 10 3 = 1 3 + 12 3 = 1729 { \ displaystyle 9 ^ {3} + 10 ^ {3} = 1 ^ {3} + 12 ^ {3} = 1729}
 isi prakaar, Hence Ramanujan numbers are 1729, 4104, 20683, 39312, 40033 etc
 pilaa ek rang he jo ki maanviya chakshu ke shankuon main lambe evam madhyam, donon tarang dairghy waalon ko prabhavit karata he
 This is the letter in which the red and green characters are in abundance, and the blue letters are less
 is kaa tarang dairghy 570–580 nm he
 This color resembles corn pods, or grains
 ise halakaa golden rod bhi kehete hai
 It is made from a mixture of lemon and cream color
 yah saanchaa:desh aankade nawajo ke dhvaj kaa rang he
 Saffron kesaria rang kesar naamak masaale se mila rang hota he
 'this color represents the Hindus at the top of the national flag of India
 sunaharaa yaa suvarna rang sona dhaatu se bana he

 Chandrakanta is one of the earliest Hindi novels written by Devkinandan Khatri
 isaki rachana 19 veen sadi ke aakhri main hui thi
 This novel became very popular and it is said that many people had learned Devanagari to read it
 yah tilism or aiyaari par aadhaarit he or iskaa naam nayika ke naam par rakhaa gaya he
 Chandrakanta can be called a love story
 is shuddh loukik prem kahani ko, do dushman rajgharaanon, navgarh or vijaigarh ke bich, prem or ghrinaa kaa virodhabhas aage badhaata he
 Princess Chandrakanta of Vijaygarh and Prince Virendra Vikram of Navgarh love each other
 lekin raaj pariwaron main dushmani he
 The reason for the enmity is that the Maharaj of Vijaygarh considers the king of Navgarh responsible for killing his brother
 halanki iskaa jimmedaar vijaigarh kaa mahaamantri krur singh he, jo chandrakanta se shaadi karne or vijaigarh kaa maharaj banane kaa sapana dekh rahaa he
 Along with the lead story of Princess Chandrakanta and Prince Virendra Vikram, the love story of Aiyar Tej Singh and Aiyara Chapla also goes on
 katha kaa ant naugarh ke raja surendra singh ke putr virendra singh tathaa vijaygarh ke raja jaisingh kii putree chandrakanta ke parinay se hota he

 The term mustard oil is used to refer to three different types of oils that are made from mustard seeds
 sahijan yaa vasabi kii tarah is tel kii gandh teevr hoti he, iskaa swaad kashay hota he or aksar iskaa upyog uttar pradesh, gujarat, urisa, bengal, bihar, jharkhand, chhattisgarh, assam or bharat ke anya kshetron or bangladesh main khaanaa pakaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 In North India it is mainly used for frying pakoras
 bengal main khaanaa pakaane ke liye is tel ko paaramparik rup se pasand kiya jaataa he, haalanki sanflower jaise tatasth-swaad vaale telon kaa istemaal bhi bade paimaane par kiya jaataa he
 This oil is made up of about 30% mustard seeds
 iskaa utpaadan kaale sarson or safed sarson se kiya ja saktaa he
 Mustard oil contains 60% monounsaturated fatty acids with 42% erucic acid and 12% oleic acid, 21% polyunsaturated, of which 6% omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid and 15% omega-6 linolenic acid And contains 12% saturated fat
 kenola or shaljam samet brasika parivaar ke sabhi beej kii hi tarah sarson ke beej main bhi omega-3 kaa ucch str hota he or ek aam, sasta, paudha aadhaarit omega-3 fatty acid bade paimaane par utpaadan strot hai 
 san tel main paudha-aadhaarit 55% omega-3 hota he lekin ek teble yaa khaanaa pakaane ke tel ke rup main asaamaanya he
 Soybean oil contains 6% omega-3, but also contains more than 50% omega-6 fatty acids that equate with omega-3 properties
 repasid or sarson ke tel ke alaava, pashchimi or bhartiya bhojan main paudha-aadhaarit omega-3 ke kuch anya saamaanya strot hai
 Especially when omega-6 intake is kept low, humans can convert a limited amount of omega-3 plants into fish omega-3, eicosapentaenoic acid, which is useful for vegetarians
 bharat main, sarson ke tel ko khaanaa pakaane se pehle jalane tak garam kiya jaataa he; aisa gandh ko kam karne or swaad ko badhaane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 However, prolonged overheating results in the depletion of omega-3 in the oil and reduces its unique role in health
 pashchimi deshon main, aksar isaki bikri bhartiya apravasiyon ke nimitt dukaanon main "keval bahya istemaal ke liye" hoti he, chunki uttar bharat main sarson ke tel kaa prayog ragadne or maalish ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he, aisa mana jaataa he ki isse rakt parisancharan, mansapeshi vikaas or twachaa kii banaavat main sudhaar hota he; yah tel jeevanurodhi bhi hota he
 Sometimes even before sexual intercourse, men use this oil in the genitals to maintain their sexual power or increase their virility
 maanav swasthya par khaadya telon ke irusik acid ke prabhaav vivaadaaspad rahe hai
 However, its negative effects on the health of humans are not yet documented
 irusik acid or olek acid kaa chaar bate ek mishran lorenzon tel kaa nirmaan karata he; jo tantrika jeev vigyaan ke ek durlabh vikaar adrenolikodistrophy ke liye ek prayogtmak upachaar he
 For a time it was considered unsuitable for human consumption in the United States, Canada and the European Union due to the excess of erucic acid in mustard oil

 After hiring James Roombog's services from General Electric in 1994, Rational Software Corporation became the source of two of today's most popular object-oriented modeling methods: roombog's OMT, which was better for object-oriented analysis, and Grady Booch Butch method, which was better for object oriented design

 UML is not a growth method by itself, however, it was designed to be compatible with the major object-purpose software development methods of its time
 Since UML has evolved, some of these methods have been re-molded to take advantage of the new notation and new methods have been built based on UML

 It is clear that it is more efficient than half-wave rectifier
 ek-phej paripathon main do tarah ke purna-tarang dishtakaari prayog kiye jate hai: Center-tap rectifier requires only two diodes, but this requires a center-tap transformer
 During the positive cycle of center tap / midpoint rectifier-supply, diode D1 becomes forward bias and behaves like a closed key
 This diode D2 sleeps reverse bye and behaves like an open key, diode D2 forward bias sleeps off key during the negative cycle of the supply In the meantime, diode D1 becomes reverse bias and behaves like an open key
