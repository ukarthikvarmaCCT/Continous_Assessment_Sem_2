 shoonyavad yaa shoonyata baudhon kii mahayan shakha madhyamik naamak vibhaag kaa mat yaa siddhanth he jisamen sansar ko shunya or uske sab padaarthon ko sattahin mana jaataa he 
 "secondary justice" has adopted "nihilism" as a philosophical principle
 iske anusaar gyey or gyaan donon hi kalpit hai
 The ultimate element is the only "zero"
 "shunya" saar, asat, sadasat or sadasadvilakshan, in chaar kotiyon se alag he
 The world is the inversion of this "void"
 vivart kaa mul he sanvruti, jo avidya or vaasana ke naam se bhi abhihit hoti he
 According to this opinion, upon the retirement of the karmakales, a person attains nirvana and calms in the same way as oil and light when it ends
 nagarjun kii drushti main mul tatv shunya ke atirikt anya kuch nahin he
 The point to note is that this zero is not a prohibitive object to be dealt with
 kisi bhi padaarth kaa swarupanirnay karne main chaar hi kotiyon kaa prayog sambhavya he - Paramarth is free from these four categories and that's why we use the word "zero" for its designation
 nagarjun ke shabdon main Nagarjuna has used subversive reasoning for the attainment of nihilism - that logic, with the help of analyzing matter, it only remains in the void
 is tark ke bal par dravya, gati jati, kaal, sansarg, aatma, aadi tatwon kaa bada hi gambhir, maarmik tathaa moulik vivechan karne kaa shrey nagarjun ko he
 In this view, there are two types of truth - jinamein pratham avidya se utpann vyaavhaarik satta kaa sanket karata he; dwitiya pragna janit satya kaa pratipadak he
 The word "samvruti" means avidya
 avidyajanit hone se vyaavhaarik satya saanvruthik satya ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 In the view of Nagarjuna, this two-pronged interpretation of truth is not the new imagination evoked by nihilism, indicated by ancient Buddha itself
 buddha ke katipay upadesh vyaavhaarik satya ke aadhaar par die gaye hai; anya upadesh parmaarthik satya ke upar alambit hai
 Buddha is both desired - nagarjun darshanik hote hue bhi vyavhaar kii upeksha karanevaale acharya nahin the
 They know that without taking shelter of behavior, there can be no preaching of charitable and in the absence of attainment of charitableness, Nirvana cannot be attained
 saadhaaran maanvon kii buddhi vyavhaar main itani aasakt he ki use parmarthpath par laane ke liye vyavhaar kaa aplaap nahin kiya ja saktaa
 As a result, the untruth of behavior is not an object rendered by charitable words
 isiilie use "anksharatatv" ke abhidhaan se jaanate hai
 The charitable entity is so obsessed with behavior that it cannot be practiced to bring it to the ultimate path
 falat: vyavhaar kii "asatyata" dikhalaakar hi sadhak ko parmarth main pratishthit karnaa padataa he
 Paramarth is not a thing rendered by words
 isiilie use ankshar tatv ke abhidhaan se jaanate hai
 The ultimate essence is unintelligible, unobtrusive, omnipotent and unimaginative from intelligence, but only by imposing the worldly substances on it can we gain knowledge
 yah tatv vedantiyon ke adhyarope tathaa apvadvidhi se nimant saadrishy rakhata he

 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga Both Jai and Vijay were gatekeepers of Lord Vishnu, due to their idiocy they got cursed
 ek baar sanak, sanandan, sanathan or sanatkumar sampoorn lokon se virakt hokar chitt kii shaanti ke liye bhagwaan vishnu ke darshan karne hetu unke baikuntha lok main gayi
 Two gatekeepers named Jai and Vijay were guarded at the gate of Baikuntha
 jai or vijay ne in sanakadik rishiyon ko dwaar par hi roak liya or baikuntha lok ke bheetar jane se manaa karne lage
 On their refusal in this way, the Sankadik sages said, "oh fools! We are the ultimate devotees of Lord Vishnu
 hamaari gati kahin bhi nahin rukati he
 We want to see Devadhidev
 tum hamen unke darshanon se kyon rokte ho? tum log to bhagwaan kii seva main rahete ho, tumhen to unheen ke samaan samdarshi hona chaiye
 The nature of God is absolute peace, so should your nature
 hamen bhagwaan vishnu ke darshan ke liye jane do
 "even when the sages say this, Jai and Vijay stop them from entering Baikunth
 jai or vijay ke is prakaar rokane par sanakadik rishiyon ne cruddh hokar kaha, "bhagwaan vishnu ke sameep rahane ke baad bhi tum logon main ahankaar aa gaya he or ahamkaari kaa vaas baikuntha main nahin ho saktaa
 That is why we curse you that you go into sin and enjoy the consequences of your sin
 " unke is prakaar shaap dene par jai or vijay bhaybheet hokar unke charnon main gir pade or kshamaa maangane lage
 Knowing that the Sanakadik sages have come to meet Lord Vishnu himself, along with Lakshmi ji and all his councilors, came to welcome him
 bhagwaan vishnu ne unase kaha, "he munishwaron! ye jai or vijay naam ke mere parshad hai
 Both of them have taken offense by insulting you with arrogance and intellect
 aap log mere priy bhakt hai or inhone aapaki avagya karke meri bhi avagya kii he
 You have done a great job by cursing them
 in anucharon ne tapasviyon kaa tiraskaar kiya he or use main apana hi tiraskaar maanata hoon
 i apologize on behalf of these councilors
 sevakon kaa aparaadh hone par bhi sansar swami kaa hi aparaadh maanata he
 Therefore, i wish you begging for happiness
 " The anger of the Sanakadik sages immediately calmed down with these sweet words of God
 bhagwaan kii is udaartaa se ve ati anandit huye or bole, "aap dharm kii maryaada rakhane ke liye hi apane itnaa aadar dete hai
 Hey Nath! We have cursed these innocent councilors under the control of anger and we apologize for this
 aap uchit samajhen to in dwarapalon ko kshamaa karke hamaare shaap se mukt kar sakate hai
 " bhagwaan vishnu ne kaha, "he muniganon! mai sarvashaktimaan hone ke baad bhi brahmanon ke vachan ko asaty nahin karnaa chahta kyonki isse dharm kaa ulanghan hota he
 The curse that you have given is from my inspiration
 ye avashya hi is dand ke bhaagi hai
 They will go into the womb of Diti and get the monster's vagina and they will be killed by me
 ye mujhase shatrubhav rakhte huye bhi mere hi dhyaan main leen rahenge
 After i kill them, they will come back to this dham again

 Los angeles huston Names of Allah in Islam: According to tradition, there are at least 99 names of Allah in Islam, known as' Asmau Allahi al-husna "the beautiful names of Allah"
 9veen shatabdi ke haddees ke sangrah ke anusaar, "99 naam" hone kii parampara sahi he, jabaki kam se kam teen alag-alag roopon main kuch sangraahakon dwaara die gaye 99 naamon kii vaastavik suchi kii parampara he garib kaha jaataa he
 Most of the names in these lists are derived from the Quranic text, with a minority in the oral tradition or Sunnah
 naamon kii suchiyaan alag-alag hoti hai kyonki 99 se adhik visheshtaon ko chunane ke liye alag alag prastaav sambodhnaayen or sandarbh kii zaroorat hoti he, or us prakaar hi chunajata he
 Different mentions give different lists of 99 names
 haddees main, mohammad ne kai naamon se allaah ko bulaayaa he
 The origin of the number 99 is particularly attributed to the weakly assumed hadith, although there are at least quoted hadiths that are considered authentic and support the same point
 sahi muslim haddees ke anusaar, 35: 6475 : The Quran refers to the "most beautiful name" of Allah
 gerhard bowing ne sura 17:110 ko locas clasicus ke rup main sanderbhit kiya he, jisamen quran kii tippanee main 99 naamon kii spasht suchiyaan sanlagn kii gai thim
 Import 22: 22–24 contains a group of more than a dozen celestial epithets included in such lists
 rahasywaadee darshanik ebn arabi ne anumaan lagaaya ki 99 naam "brahmad ke aantarik rahasyon ke bahari sanket" hai
 However most of the 99 traditionally listed 99 names are found nowhere in the Quran
 dusron ko haddees se liya jaataa he
 The list is not even necessary, as more than 99 divine names can be linked to the Quran and Hadith
 musalamaanon ke bich koi saarvbhaumik samjhauta nahin he ki vastav main allaah ke naam ke rup main kya myne rakhata he, or kya nahin
 Additionally, while some names are only in the Quran, and others are only in the Hadith, there are some names that appear in both

 The compilations of all Abu Hurairah are the basic features of the list of names
 al- tirmizi ne apni suchi main tippanee kii: "yah haddees garib he; ise abu hurairah ke adhikaar par vibhinn margon se sunaaya gaya he, lekin ham naamon ke ullekh ke bare main nahin jaanate is ke alaava, kai kathaayen hai
 "many early Muslim Mufassirins, including Jafr al-sadiq, Sufyan ibn 'uyanah, Ibn Hazm, al-qurtubi, Ibn Hajar al-asqalani, have given their versions of lists of 99 names

 Under the youth leadership of Kashi Singh Ari, the state's first assembly election in 2002, the party won 4 out of 70 seats and was successful in making its important role in electoral gains and formation of governments in the state, but a separate state

 In the January 2012 elections, the party won 1 out of 70 seats, but neither the BJP nor the Congress got an absolute majority and therefore played an important role in forming the next government of Ukraine and supported the Congress which won the majority
 It was close and thus in February 2012, the Congress government was formed with the support of Ukrad

 The stories are: in sab atthakathaon kaa praneta praayah buddhaghosh ko mana jaataa he
 Apart from this, there are different stories on the texts of 'khuddakanikaya', among which the jataka-atthakatha and dhammapada-atthakatha are particularly notable
 jataka main keval buddha bhagwaan ke purvajanm se sambandh rakhanevaali gaathaayen hai, jo bina jataka-atthkatha ke samaj main nahin aa saktin
 All these stories are a repository of the ancient culture of India, which is full of history stuff

 There have been many persons named Dhaumya including the author of a scripture
 par sabase prasiddh hai deval ke chote bhai jo pandavon ke kulpurohit the
 He was the son of Apod Rishi
 isaliye ve bahudhaa yod dhaumy ke naam se jane jate hai
 The sage Dhoomya, who lived in Dwaparyuga 5000 years ago, was a priest of Krishna, Krishna lover and great Shiva devotee
 unhone utkochak tirth main nivas karke saalon tak tapashwarya kii thi
 He was the son of Prajapati Kushashva and Dhishna and was brother of the famous sages Deval, Vedashira etc
 by this connection
 unako devguru brihaspati ke samatulya sammaan diya jaataa hai
 He was the vice-chancellor of Pandavas and the Guru of Upamanyu, Aruni, Panchal and Vaid
 ghumy pandavo ke param hitaishi hi nahin, unke samast kaaryon se jude huye the, aisa mana jaataa he
 According to the various episodes described in the Mahabharata, Dhaumya was involved in various episodes of the life of sage Pandavas
 vanvaas ke dauraan pandavo ne dhaumy ko apane purohit ke rup main sweekaar kiya tha
 The Pandavas were escaping from the Lakshagriha built by Duryodhana and Shakuni
 unheen dinon ek brahman se paanchalraj drupad kii putree draupadi ke swayamvar ke vishay main suna
 He was going with the idea of being present at the swayamvara
 ganga paar karke aage badhate samay chitrarath naamak gandharva se arjuna kaa yuddh hua
 Arjuna defeated Chitraratha
 baadamein vah pandavo kaa param mitra ban gaya
 He explained to the Pandavas that the Pandavas' predicament is happening only in the absence of the priest
 useene utkochak tirth par rahete dhaumy ko apana purohit bana lene kaa suzav diya to pandvone saharsha dhaumy ko apana purohit bana liya
 When the sage saw the events of the entire Mahabharata from his inner eye, he was gladly ready to be his priest
 pandavon ke vanvaas ke liye dhaumy unke aage-aage yama samgaan or rudra samgaan gaate hue chale the
 He went to Panchali's swayamvar by making him a priest
 yantra panigrahan hua
 At the door of the house, he informed his mother that today he had brought a new thing, Kunti requested him to share it among the five brothers
 tab dhaumy ne hi yudhisthir se sahadev tak paanch pandavon ke saath draupadi kaa vivaah karmanushthan karaayaa
 Not only this, he had completed the Jat karma, Upanayana etc
 rites of the Pandava sons
 pandav ghutakrida main haar kar baarah varsh ke vanvaas ke liye gayi to dhaumy bhi unke saath santusht karne tathaa akshay paatr praapt karne kaa upadesh diya tha
 
 yudhisthir tirthon kii yatra par nikle to dhaumy unke saath the
 Dhaumya introduced him to the pilgrimages of the four directions
 tabhi lomash muni ne arjuna ke doot ban kar unhen yah samachar diya tha ki ve bhagavan shiv ko prasann karke pashupathastra jaise divyakh praapt kar chuke hai or avilamb waapas aane vaale hai
 After that Lomash expressed his desire to go on a pilgrimage with him
 vanvaas-kaal main pandavon par bakasur ke bhai kirmir ne dhaava bol diya or vah mayaprayogon dwaara unhen parajeet karne kaa prayaas kar rahaa tha
 Then Dhaumya foiled his illusion
 vanvaas kaal main sindhudesh kaa raja tathaa duryodhana kaa bahanoi jaydrath ek baar pandavon kii anupasthiti main draupadi ke paas aayaa
 Draupadi welcomed him
 draupadi ke rupasoundarya par mugdh jaydrath ne usase saath chalane kaa aagrah kiya
 When he abducted Draupadi on the insult of Draupadi, Dhaumya reprimanded Jayadratha and also tried to free him from the clutches of Jayadratha
 pandavon ke agyatavaas ke samay viraat desh main agyatavaas kaa vidhi-vidhaan dhaumy ne hi samajhaayaa
 At the time of his exile, Dhaumya performed Asishtom Karma
 unki saarvbhaum unnati evam rajya-prapti hetu veda-mantroccharan kiya
 While leaving the Pandavas, they went to Panchal country with fire in their hands
 kurukshetra yuddh main mrit pandav-bandhuon kaa dah-karm dhaumy ne karaayaa
 On the coronation of Maharaja Yudhishthira, Dhaumya preached to him Rajdharma
 shar-shayya par pade bhishma se milane yudhisthir dhaumy ke saath gayi the
 He was present in Yudhishthira's Rajsuya Yagna and he told Vatapi the appropriate place for the Yajna
 dhaumy hi hota the or unheen ne yudhisthir kaa rajbhishek kiya
 Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya after the slaughter of Ravana, many sages and sages came to meet him
 pashchim disha se aaye muniyon main dhaumy bhi the
 Dwarkadhish Lord Krishna stayed in Hastinapur for several days in the context of the Kurukshetra war
 ab unhen dwarka janaa tha
 When he asked permission from the Pandavas and relatives, Dhaumya along with the Pandavas was also deceived by Shri krishna-virah-tampa
 yodadhumy ke ashram main opeveshik gautam kaa putr aaruni, vasishtha kulotpann vyaghrapad kaa putr upamanyu tathaa vaid shiksha pate the
 Dhaumya was very hardworking and used to work a lot with the disciples
 par unke shishy guru ke prati itnaa aadar evam shraddha rakhte the ki ve kabhi unki ajna kaa ulanghan nahin karte the
 Dhaumya took the test of Aruni on the very first day
 us din khub varsha ho rahi thi
 Then Dhaumya told Aruni that the rain should come in the dam so that rain water stays in the field and does not come out
 aaruni guru kii ajna paakar band dekhne gaya
 He noticed that the mend has broken and the water is flowing rapidly
 pani rokane ke uske saare prayaas vyarth gayi to vah swayan pani ko rokane ke liye let gayi the
 Yoga refers to a spiritual process in India and Nepal in which the work of bringing the body, mind and soul together
 yah shabd, prakriya or dharna buddha dharm,jain dharm or hindu dharm main dhyaan prakriya se sambandhit he
 The word Yoga has spread from India to Buddhism in China, Japan, Tibet, South East Asia and Sri Lanka as well and people are familiar with it at all times in this civilized world
 itani prasiddhi ke baad pehali baar 11 disambar 2014 ko sanyukt raashtra mahasabha ne prayek varsh 21 june ko vishwa yoga diwas ke rup main manyata di he
 The Bhagavadgita is considered to be the reputed text
 usamen yoga shabd kaa kai baar prayog hua he, kabhi akele or kabhi savisheshan, jaise buddhiyog, sanyasayog, karmyog
 The names Bhakti Yoga and Hatha Yoga have also become popular during the Vedas period, Patanjali is seen in Yogadarshan, the word Kriya Yoga
 pashupat yoga or maheshwar yoga jaise shabdon ke bhi prasang milte he
 The meanings of the word yoga in all these places are against each other, but it is clear from looking at various such experiments that it is difficult to define yoga
 paribhaasha aisi honi chahie jo avyaapti or ativyapti dosha se mukt ho, yoga shabd ke vaacharth kaa aisa lakshan batala sake jo prayek prasang ke liye upyukt ho or yoga ke sivaay kisi anya vastu ke liye upyukt na ho
 The word 'yoga' is derived from the use of the suffix 'hh' in the 'yuz samadhau' atmanapadi dividiginal metal
 is prakaar ‘yoga’ shabd kaa arth hua- samadhi arthath chitt vrittiyon kaa nirodh
 By the way, the word 'yoga' is also derived from 'yujir Yoga' and 'use restraint' metal, but then in this case the meaning of the word Yoga will be sum, addition and regulation respectively
 aage yoga main ham dekhenge ki aatma or paramatma ke vishay main bhi yoga kaha gaya he
 In the Gita, Shri Krishna has said at a place 'yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam'
 spasht he ki yah vaakya yoga kii paribhaasha nahin he
 Some scholars are of the opinion that the joining of the soul and the divine is called yoga
 is baat ko sweekaar karne main yah badi aapatti khadi hoti he ki baudhdhamtavlambee bhi, jo paramatma kii satta ko sweekaar nahin karte, yoga shabd kaa vyavhaar karte or yoga kaa samarthan karte hai
 The same can be said for the communists who consider the authority of God to be imperfect
 pantajali ne yogadarshan main, jo paribhaasha di he 'yogashchittavrittinirodeh', chitt kii vrittiyon ke nirodh kaa naam yoga he
 This sentence can have two meanings: Yoga is the name of the state of detention of the mind, or the remedy to bring this state is called Yoga
 parantu is paribhaasha par kai vidwaanon ko aapatti he
 He says that the name of the flow of Chittavaritas is Chitta
 purna nirodh kaa arth hoga chitt ke astitv kaa purna lop, chittashray samast smritiyon or sanskaron kaa ni:shesh ho janaa
 If this happens then it will not be possible to rise from the tomb
 kyonki us avasthaa ke sahare ke liye koi bhi sanskaar bachaa nahin hoga, praarabdh dagdh ho gaya hoga
 If possible, what will be the meaning of this sentence of Shri Krishna? Yogastha: Situated in Kuru Karmani, yoga and do karma
 viruddhavastha main karm ho nahin saktaa or us avasthaa main koi sanskaar nahin pad sakate, smritiyaan nahin ban saktin, jo samadhi se uthne ke baad karm karne main sahaayak hon
 In short, the meaning is that it is not very easy to understand the classical form of yoga, its philosophical basis, in a proper way
 sansar ko mithyaa maananevaala advaitavaadi bhi nididhyahn ke naam se uskaa samarthan karata he
 The Atheistic Sankhya scholar also approves it
 buddha hi nahin, muslim sufi or isai mistic bhi kisi na kisi prakaar apane sampradaay kii manyataon or darshanik siddhanton ke saath uskaa saamanjasy sthapit kar lete hai
 How can there be such coordination among these various philosophical ideologies that such a ground can be found on which the wall of yoga can be built, this is a very interesting question, but much time is needed for its discussion
 yahan us prakriya par thodaa sa vichaar kar lenaa aavashyak he jisaki ruparekha hamako patanjali ke sutron main milti he
 With a little word, this process is valid for all communities that support the practice of yoga
 yoga kii ucchavastha samadhi, moksh, kaivalya aadi tak pahunchne ke liye anekon saadhakon ne jo saadhan apanaaye unheen sadhano kaa varnan yoga granthon main samay samay par miltaa rahaa
 He came to be known as Yoga
 yoga kii pramanik pustakon main shivasanhita tathaa gorakshashatak main yoga ke chaar prakaaron kaa varnan miltaa he - Both of the above shlokas resulted in types of yoga: Mantra Yoga, Hatha Yoga Laya Yoga and Raja Yoga
 'mantra' kaa samaanya arth he- 'mananaat traite iti mantra'
 The mind has a triad mantra
 mantra yoga kaa sambandh man se he, man ko is prakaar paribhaashit kiya he- manan iti manah
 The mind that meditates is the mind
 man kii chanchalta kaa nirodh mantra ke dwaara karnaa mantra yoga he
 The description of Mantra Yoga in the Yogatattvopanishad is as follows- mantra se dhwani tarangen paidaa hoti he mantra sharir or man donon par prabhaav daalata he
 In mantra, the seeker uses chanting
 There are three components of great importance in mantra chanting
 They are pronunciation, pronunciation, rhythm and rhythm
 teenon kaa sahi anupaat mantra shakti ko badha detaa he
 Chanting is mainly done in four ways
 hath kaa shabdic arth hathpurvak kisi kaary karne se liya jaataa he
 In the book Hatha Pradeepika, the meaning of Hatha is given as follows- ha kaa arth surya tath tha kaa arth chandra bataaya gaya he
 Hatha Yoga is the same state of Sun and Moon
 sharir main kai hajaar naadiyaan he unamem teen pramukh naadiyon kaa varnan he, ve is prakaar hai
 Suryanadi means Pingala which signifies right tone
 chandranadi arthath ida jo baayen swar kaa pratik he
 The third pulse between these two is the spinal cord
 is prakaar hathyog vah kriya he jisamen pingala or ida naadee ke sahare praan ko sushumna naadee main pravesh karakar brahamarandhra main samadhisth kiya jaataa he
 The Hatha Pradipika describes the four parts of Hatha Yoga - Asana, Pranayama, Mudra and Bandha and Nadanusadhan
 gherandsamhita main saat ang- shatkarm, asana, mudrabandh, pranayam, dhyaan, samadhi jabaki yogatvopanishad main aath angon kaa varnan he- yama, niyam, asana, pranayam, pratyaahaar, dharna, dhyaan, bhramadhyehrim or samadhi
 The dissolution of the mind in its form or the detached state of the mind comes under lāyoga
 sadhak ke chi main jab chalate, baithte, sote or bhojan karte samay har samay brahm kaa dhyaan rahe isi ko layayog kehete hai
 The description in the Yogatvopanishad is as follows- rajyog sabhi yogon kaa raja kahalaaya jaataa he kyonki isamen prayek prakaar ke yoga kii kuch na kuch saamagree avashya mil jaati he
 a description of Ashtanga Yoga composed by Raja Yoga Maharishi Patanjali
 rajyog kaa vishay chittavritiyon kaa nirodh karnaa he
 According to Maharishi Patanjali, it is suggested for practicing those with embodied mind and the path to move forward by resorting to detachment and action to those with deranged mind
 in sadhano kaa upyog karke sadhak ke cleshon kaa naash hota he, chittaprasann hokar gyaan kaa prakaash failata he or vivekkhyati praapt hoti he he
 Under Raja Yoga, Maharish Patanjali has told Ashtanga in this way - yoga ke aath angon main pratham paanch bahirang tathaa anya teen antarang main aate hai
 In addition to the above four types, the Gita describes two types of yogas
 gyanayog, sankhyayog se sambandh rakhata he
 Knowledge of yoga is to be free from the bondage of male nature
 sankhya darshan main 25 tatwon kaa varnan miltaa he
 Regarding the Tapasva Tapas under the Vedic codes, there is mention in the Vedas since ancient times, while the inclusion of Tapasic practices is found in the ancient Vedic commentaries
 kai murtiyan jo saamaanya yoga yaa samadhi mudra ko pradarshit karti he, sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke sthaan par praapt huin he
 According to archaeologist Gregory Pössehl, "these statues indicate the connection of yoga to the religious rites of yoga"
 yadhyapi is baat kaa nirnayaatmak saboot nahin he phir bhi anek panditon kii raay main sindhu ghati sabhyataa or yoga-dhyaan main sambandh he
 The practice of attaining higher enlightenment in meditation was developed by scholarly traditions and by the tradition of the Upanishads
 buddha ke purv evam pracheen brahminic granthon me dhyaan ke bare main koi thos saboot nahin milte hai, buddha ke do shikshakon ke dhyaan ke lakshyon ke prati kahe vaakyon ke aadhaar par vaynn yah tark karte he kii nirgun dhyaan kii paddati brahmin parampara se nikali isliye upanishad kii sristi ke prati kahe kathanon main evam dhyaan ke lakshyon ke liye kahe kathanon main samanta he
 It may or may not be possible
 upanishdon main brahmand sambandhi bayano ke vaishvik kathanon main kisi dhyaan kii reeti kii sambhaavna ke prati tark dete hue kehete he kii naradiya sookt kisi dhyaan kii paddati kii ore rug veda se purv bhi ishaara karte he
 This Buddhist book is probably the most ancient text in which meditation techniques are described
 ve dhyaan kii prathaon or avasthaaon kaa varnan karte he jo buddha se pehle astitv main thim or saath hi un prathaon kaa varnan karte he jo pehle buddha dharm ke bheetar viksit huin
 hindu vaanmay main,"yoga" shabd pehle katha upanishad main prastut hua jahaan gyanendriyon kaa niyantran or maansik gatividhi ke nivaaran ke arth main prayukt hua he jo ucchtam sthiti pradaan karne vaala man gaya he
 Important texts related to the concept of yoga are the Middle Ages Upanishads, Mahabharata, Bhagavad Gita 200 BCE) and Patanjali Yoga Sutras
 bhartiya darshan main, shad darshanon main se ek kaa naam yoga he
 Yoga is closely related to the philosophical system, the Sankhya school
 rishi patanjali dwaara vyakhyayit yoga sampradaay sankhya manovigyaan or tatvamimasaa ko sweekaar karata he, lekin sankhya gharaane kii tulana main adhik aastik he, yah pramaan he kyonki sankhya vaastaviktaa ke pachchis tatwon main ishwariya satta bhi jodi gai he
 Yoga and Samkhya are so similar to each other that Max Müller states, "these two philosophies were so famous that one is considered to be one with Prabhu and the other without Prabhu to understand each other's differences
 xxrep 4 
 " sankhya or yoga ke bich ghanishtha sambandh henrich zimmer samajhaate he: Both of these are considered as twins in India, which are two aspects of the same subject

 Yoga specifically treats treatments for the reconciliation of process dynamics and theorizes practical techniques for attaining liberation or 'separation-integration'
 patanjali, vyapak rup se aupchaarik yoga darshan ke sansthaapak mane jate he
 Patanjali's yoga, a system for the control of the intellect, is known as Raja Yoga
 patanjali unke duusare sutara me "yoga" shabd kaa paribhaashit karte he, jo unke puure kaam ke liye vyakhya sutara mana jaataa he: Yoga: chitta-vritti Nirodha: - Yoga Sutra 1
2 teen sanskrit shabdon ke arth par yah sanskrit paribhaasha tikaa he
 IK Taimani translates it as "yoga is a prohibition of modifications of the intellect"
 yoga kaa praarambhik paribhaasha me is shabd nirodhaḥ kaa upyog ek udhaaharan he ki bauddhik takneekee shabdaawalee or avadharanaon, yoga sutara me ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaate he; isse yah sanket hota he ki buddha vichaaron ke bare main patanjali ko jaankaree thi or apane pranali me unhen bunai
swami vivekanand is sutara ko anuwaad karte hue kehete he,"yoga buddhi ko vibhinn roopon lene se avaruddh karata he
 Patanjali's writing "ashtanga Yoga" became the basis for a system
 aath ang hai: In the view of this sect, the highest attainment does not reveal the experienced diversity of the world as an illusion
 This world is real
 iske alaava, ucchtam prapti aisa ghatana he jahaan anek main se ek vyaktitv swayan, aatm ko avishkaar karata he, koi ek saarvbhaumik aatm nahin he jo sabhi vyaktiyon dwaara saajha jaataa he
 Bhagavad-gītā, uses the term yoga in a wide variety of ways
 ek puraa adhyay sahit paaramparik yoga kaa abhyaas ko samarpit, dhyaan ke sahit, karne ke alaava is me yoga ke teen pramukh prakaar kaa parichay kiya jaataa he

 This was the next step in the development of the computer programming language
 asembler ke sthaan par compiler or interprator kaa vikaas kiya gaya
 Now, to write computer programs, the machine language has been used in place of numerical implementation signals, as a memento reminder
 computer main prayog kii jane vaali vah bhashaa jisame angreji aksharo, sankhyao evam chinho kaa prayog karke program likhaa jaataa he, use ucch stareey programing bhashaa kaha jaataa he
 Writing programs in this language is very easy for the programmer, because there is no need to write any instructions in machine code
 jaise -BASIC, cobol,fortran,pascal|ab to ucch stareey programing bhashaao kaa atyant vikaas ho chukaa he
 These programming languages are divided into four categories according to the work - scientific programming languages - they are mainly used to make programs for scientific work, but some of these languages are also those which other than scientific work are also similar
 She does it efficiently
 jaise-algol,basic,pascal,fortran, aadi he
 Business programming languages-related to business functions such as ledger, daily paper, stock etc
, can be done very easily by programs of business programming languages
 jaise-pl1,cobol, DBASE aadi
 Special purpose programming languages - These languages are used to perform various tasks with special ability
 jaise-apl360- periphiral yuktiyaan sarvshereshth anuprayog hetu prayog kii jaati he
 This language came into vogue since 1968

 This is a very important achievement
 program ke prayogkarta ke computer badalane par arthath vibhinn ALU or Control unit main bhi yah program sookshmatam sudhaar ke baad samaan rup se chalata he
 The words used in these languages are in the common English language
 in programing bhashaao main galatiyo kii sambhaavna kam hoti he tathaa galatiyo ko jald dhundhakar sudhara ja saktaa he
 The translator used by the compiler or interpreter program itself informs which line and instructions are in error

 He developed high-level languages around 1952
 jisame ek compiler kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 Two high-level programming languages were developed under the direction of Dr
 Hopper, the first being FLOWMATIC and MATHEMATICS
 FLOWMATIC ek vyavsaayik programing bhashaa thi or MATHEMATICS ek ankaganitiya gananaao main prayukt kii jane vaali bhashaa
 Since then, around 225 high-level programming languages have been developed

 It is clear from the facts below that there is a physical relationship between the diurnal variance of earth currents and earth magnetism: runi ke anusaar pradarshit waterlu chumbakeey bal or bhu-dhaaraon ke dainik vicharan kii dar chitra main pradarshit he
 Curve a in the figure represents the diurnal variation of the northern component of the water currents of Waterloo, and curve b is the time derivative of the eastern component of the horizontal magnetic force at the same location
 chitra main sampurna raikhik vakr us sthaan ke chumbakeey bal ke purvi avyav ke vicharan kaa sanket karata he
 Since the curves a and b are almost parallel, the bending of one of these shows a contingency relationship of the variances represented by a and B
 It is not inconsistent to understand that most, if not all, of the currents are induced by variations in Earth magnetic forces
 There are currents
 saath hi yah bhi tathy he ki is dhaaraon ke nirmaan main anya kaarak bhi sahaayak ho sakate hai
 There seems to be systematic art difference between a and B
