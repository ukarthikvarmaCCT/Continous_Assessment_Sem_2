 Maharaja Surajmal also reached Jaipur with the help of Ishwari Singh with ten thousand soldiers and in August 1748, Jaipur was again conquered in the battle under the leadership of General Hargovind Natani at Bagru, 20 miles from Jaipur
 " Ishwari Singh had great faith in his other minister Keshavdas Khatri, but he did not like Hargovind Natani with a teary eye

 Although many European aircraft were advanced, the production consumption of the most successful aircraft was also low
 1991 main, airbas industry ke tatkaaleen CEO or prabandh nideshak jin pimmersan ne amareeki vimaan utpaadakon ke varchasv kii vyakhya karanevaale anek karkon kaa varnan kiya: sanyukt rajya america ke bhugolic vistaar ne hawaii-parivahan ko yatra kaa pasandida vikalp bana diya; 1942 ke anglo-amareeki samjhaute ne parivahan vimaanon kaa utpaadan US ko saunp diya; or dwitiya vishwa yuddh ne america ko ek "laabhakaari, balavaan, shaktishaalee or sanrachanayukta vaimaaniki udyog" pradaan kiya

 Sole airlines had already considered such a requirement; In 1959 Hawker Sidley advertised an "airbus" version of the Armstrong Whitworth AW
660 Argozzi, which would "be capable of carrying up to 126 passengers at a direct operating cost of 2d
 Per seat mile on extremely short routes
" European aircraft producers, however, were conscious of the development of such risks and had begun to acknowledge, with their governments, that cooperation was necessary to develop such an aircraft and to compete with more powerful US producers

 The French government threatened to pull out of the project due to concerns over funding at the same time for the development of the Airbus A300, Concorde and Dassault Mercure, but was refused

 Germany took advantage of this opportunity to increase its stake in the project by 50%
 Given Hawker Sidley's involvement up to that point, France and Germany were reluctant to assume the weight of its feathers

 1967 main tri-shaskeey samjhaute ke baad, roger betili ko A300 vikaas pariyojna kaa takneekee nideshak niyukt kiya gaya
 Betili developed a division of labor, which was going to become the basis for the production of Airbus in the coming years: France was to produce the lower central part of the cockpit, flight control and avionics; Hawker Sidley, whose trident technology influenced him, was to develop wings; Germany should develop the front and back of the aircraft as well as the upper central part; The Dutch were building flaps and spoilers; Spain eventually had to build the aircraft's horizontal tail

 This dramatically reduced development costs as the rolls-royce RB207 used in the A300 represented a large fraction of the cost

 The A300B was smaller, but lighter and more affordable than its three-engined American competitors
 "we showed the world we were not sitting on a nine-day wonder, and that we wanted to realise a family of planes

now we had two planes that had a great deal in common as far as systems and cockpits were concerned
" In 1972, the A300 made its first flight and the first production model, the A300B2, went into service in 1974; However the release of the A300 was defeated by the supersonic Aircraft Concord presented at the same time

 The companies tied up for the development of the Airbus category, but protected the financial statements of their own production activities and attempted to maximize the transfer prices of their sub-assemblies

 By the late 1980s, work had begun on a pair of new medium-sized aircraft, the Airbus A330 and the Airbus A340, which were the largest airplanes ever produced under the name Airbus

 However, the difficulty of consolidating and valuing the assets of the four companies, as well as legal issues, delayed the initiative

 Trigonometric identities are parities expressed as trigonometric functions of variables
 To avoid the confusion caused by the ambiguity of sin−1, the reciprocals and inverses of trigonometric functions are often displayed as in this table
 In representing the cosecant function, the longer form 'cosec' is sometimes used in place of 'csc'
 Different angular measures can be appropriate in different situations
 This table shows some of the more common systems
 Radians is the default angular measure and is the one you use if you use the exponential definitions
 All angular measures are unitless
 From the two identities above, the following table can be extrapolated
 Note however that these conversion equations may not provide the correct sign 
 For example, if sin θ = 1 / 2, the conversion in the table indicates that cos ⁡ θ = 1 − sin 2 ⁡ θ = 3 / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ cos \ theta \ ,= \ ,{ \ sqrt {1- \ sin ^{2} \ theta }}={ \ sqrt {3}} / 2}, though it is possible that cos ⁡ θ = − 3 / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ cos \ theta \ ,= \ ,-{ \ sqrt {3}} / 2} 
 More information would be needed about which quadrant θ lies in to determine a single, exact answer
 Rarely used today, the versine, coversine, haversine, and exsecant have been defined as below and used in navigation, for example the haversine formula was used to calculate the distance between two points on a sphere
 ikai vrutt kaa pareekshan karke ham trikonmittiya falnon ke nimnlikhit gunon ko sthapit kar sakate hai: When the trigonometric functions are reflected from certain values of θ { \ displaystyle \ theta}, the result is often one of the other trigonometric functions
 This leads to the following identities: By shifting the function round by certain angles, it is often possible to find different trigonometric functions that express the result more simply
 Some examples of this are given shown by shifting functions round by π / 2, π and 2π radians
 Because the periods of these functions are either π or 2π, there are cases where the new function is exactly the same as the old function without the shift
 They are also called yoga and difference formulas
 inako ular ke sutara kii sahaayta se bady aasaani se siddh kiya ja saktaa he
 x ± y = a ± b ⇒ x + y = a + b and x - y = a - b { \ displaystyle { \ begin {aligned} x \ pm y = a \ pm b & \ Rightarrow \ x + y = a + b \ \ & { \ mbox {and}} \ xy = ab \ end {aligned}}} x ± y = a ∓ b ⇒ x + y = a - b and x - y = a + b { \ displaystyle { \ begin {aligned} x \ pm y = a \ mp b & \ Rightarrow \ x + y = ab \ \ & { \ mbox {and}} \ xy = a + b \ end {aligned}}} where "|A| = k" means the index a runs through the set of all subsets of size k of the set { 1, 2, 3, 


 }
 In these two identities an asymmetry appears that is not seen in the case of sums of finitely many terms: in each product, there are only finitely many sine factors and cofinitely many cosine factors
 If only finitely many of the terms θi are nonzero, then only finitely many of the terms on the right side will be nonzero because sine factors will vanish, and in each term, all but finitely many of the cosine factors will be unity

 Its general condition can be proved with the help of mathematical incorporation

 These can be demonstrated with the help of sum and difference identities or with the help of multiplicity-angle identities
 See also Tangent half-angle formula
 These can be obtained using the second and third forms of the cosine bi-property angle formula
 If x, y, and z are the three angles of any triangle, or in other words as tan either increases through positive values or decreases through negative values
 This is a one-point compactification of the real line
) Essentially this is Ptolemy's theorem adapted to the language of trigonometry
 For some purposes it is important to know that any linear combination of sine waves of the same period but different phase shifts is also a sine wave with the same period, but a different phase shift
 In the case of a linear combination of a sine and cosine wave, we have where More generally, for an arbitrary phase shift, we have where and Sum of sines and cosines with arguments in arithmetic progression: For any a and b: where arctan is the generalization of arctan which covers the entire circular range 
 The above identity is sometimes convenient to know when thinking about the Gudermanian function
 If x, y, and z are the three angles of any triangle, i

 if x + y + z = π, then where i2 = −1
 saanchaa:split-sectionoccasionally one sees the notation ie "cis" abbreviates "cos & + & i & sin"
 Though at first glance this notation is redundant, being equivalent to eix, its use is rooted in several advantages
 This notation was more common in the post WWII era when typewriters were used to convey mathematical expressions
superscripts are both offset vertically and smaller than 'cis' or 'exp'; hence, they can be problematic even for hand writing
 For example e ix2 versus cis versus exp
 For many readers, cis is the clearest, easiest to read of the three
 The cis notation is sometimes used to emphasize one method of viewing and dealing with a problem over another
 The mathematics of trigonometry and exponentials are related but not exactly the same; exponential notation emphasizes the whole, whereas cis and cos& +& i& sin notations emphasize the parts
 This can be rhetorically useful to mathematicians and engineers when discussing this function, and further serve as a mnemonic 
 The cis notation is convenient for math students whose knowledge of trigonometry and complex numbers permit this notation, but whose conceptual understanding does not yet permit the notation e ix
 As students learn concepts that build on prior knowledge, it is important not to force them into levels of math they are not yet prepared for
 In some contexts, the cis notation may serve the pedagogical purpose of emphasizing that one has not yet proved that this is an exponential function
 In doing trigonometry without complex numbers, one may prove the two identities Similarly in treating multiplication of complex numbers, one may observe that the real and imaginary parts of the product of c1 & + & is1 and c2 & + & is2 are respectively Thus one sees this same pattern arising in two disparate contexts: This coincidence can serve as a motivation for conjoining the two contexts and thereby discovering the trigonometric identity and observing that this identity for cis of a sum is simpler than the identities for sin and cos of a sum
 Having proved this identity, one can challenge the students to recall which familiar sort of function satisfies this same functional equation The answer is exponential functions
 That suggests that cis may be an exponential function Then the question is: what is the base b? The definition of cis and the local behavior of sin and cos near zero suggest that 
 Thus the rate of change at 0 is i, so the base should be ei
 Thus if this is an exponential function, then it must be For applications to special functions, the following infinite product formulæ for trigonometric functions are useful: The Gudermannian function relates the circular and hyperbolic trigonometric functions without resorting to complex numbers; see that article for details
 The curious identity is a special case of an identity that contains one variable: a similar-looking identity is and in addition The following is perhaps not as readily generalized to an identity containing variables: Degree measure ceases to be more felicitous than radian measure when we consider this identity with 21 in the denominators: The factors 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10 may start to make the pattern clear: they are those integers less than 21 / 2 that are relatively prime to 21
 The last several examples are corollaries of a basic fact about the irreducible cyclotomic polynomials: the cosines are the real parts of the zeroes of those polynomials; the sum of the zeroes is the Möbius function evaluated at 21; only half of the zeroes are present above
 The two identities preceding this last one arise in the same fashion with 21 replaced by 10 and 15, respectively
 An efficient way to compute π is based on the following identity without variables, due to Machin: or, alternatively, by using Euler's formula: With the golden ratio φ: Also see exact trigonometric constants
 In calculus the relations stated below require angles to be measured in radians; the relations would become more complicated if angles were measured in another unit such as degrees
 If the trigonometric functions are defined in terms of geometry, their derivatives can be found by verifying two limits
 The first is: verified using the unit circle and squeeze theorem
 It may be tempting to propose to use l'hôpital's rule to establish this limit
 However, if one uses this limit in order to prove that the derivative of the sine is the cosine, and then uses the fact that the derivative of the sine is the cosine in applying l'hôpital's rule, one is reasoning circularly—a logical fallacy
 The second limit is: verified using the identity tan =) / sin
 Having established these two limits, one can use the limit definition of the derivative and the addition theorems to show that sin ′ = cos and cos ′ = −sin
 If the sine and cosine functions are defined by their Taylor series, then the derivatives can be found by differentiating the power series term-by-term
 The rest of the trigonometric functions can be differentiated using the above identities and the rules of derivative: The integral identities can be found in "list of integrals of trigonometric functions"
 The fact that the differentiation of trigonometric functions results in linear combinations of the same two functions is of fundamental importance to many fields of mathematics, including differential equations and fourier transformations
 The Dirichlet kernel Dn is the function occurring on both sides of the next identity: The convolution of any integrable function of period 2π with the Dirichlet kernel coincides with the function's nth-degree Fourier approximation
 The same holds for any measure or generalized function
 if we rakhen to, Where eix and cis are the same thing

 The gist of the story is this - there was a monk of Sumantunam in Satyayuga
 unki putree shila apane naam ke anuroop atyant susheel thi
 Sumantu Muni married that girl to Koundiniyamuni
 kaundinyamuni apni patni shila ko lekar jab sasuraal se ghar waapas laut rahe the, tab raste main nadi ke kinare kuch striyaan anant bhagwaan kii puja karte dikhaai padin
 Knowing the importance of the eternal fast, Sheela worshiped the infinite God with those women and took Anantasutra
 iske falswaroop thode hi dinon main uskaa ghar dhan-dhaany se purna ho gaya
 One day, the sight of Kaundinya Muni lying in his wife's left hand tied Anantasutra, on seeing which he got confused and he asked - Have you tied this thread to tame me? Sheela politely replied - No, this is the holy thread of the eternal God
 parantu aishwarya ke mad main andhe ho chuke kaundinyane apni patni kii sahi baat ko bhi galat samajha or anantsutrako jaadu-mantar vaala vaseekaran karne kaa doraa samajhakar tod diya tathaa use aag main daalkar jala diya
 The result of this heinous act also came to light soon
 unki sari sampatti nasht ho gai
 After being forced to live in a humbled state, Kaundinrishi decided to atone for his crime

 What they found on the way, they used to ask for the address of Anantdev
 bahut khojane par bhi kaundinyamuni ko jab anant bhagwaan kaa saakshaatkaar nahin hua, tab ve niraash hokar praan tyaagane ko udyat hue
 Then an old Brahmin came and prevented him from committing suicide and took a cave and made him see the Chaturbhuj Anantdev
 bhagwaan ne muni se kaha-tumne jo anantsutraka tiraskaar kiya he, yah sab usee kaa fal he
 For this atonement, you should observe the eternal fast for fourteen years
 is vrath kaa anushthan puraa ho jane par tumhaari nasht hui sampatti tumhen pun:praapt ho jaaegi or tum purvawat sukhi-samrudh ho jaaoge
 Kaundinyamunin accepted this command with pleasure

 When his father Shivguru Namapudri did not have any children until many years after his marriage, he along with his wife Vichitadevi wished to have a son and worshiped Lord Shankar for long
 aakhir prasann hokar bhagwaan shankar ne unhen swapn main darshan die or kaha- ‘var maango
 'shivguru asked for a longevity omniscient son from his Ishta Guru
 bhagwaan shankar ne kaha- ‘vatsa, dderghaayu putr sarvajna nahin hoga or sarvajna putr dderghaayu nahin hoga
 Say what kind of son do you want? Then the religious scholar Shivguru pleaded for the omniscient son
 ausharadaani bhagwaan shiv ne pun: kaha- ‘vatsa tumhen sarvajna putr kii prapti hogi
 i myself will come to you as a son
 ’ After some time, on the day of Vaishakh Shukla Panchami in AD 686, in the middle of the day, Visheshdevi gave birth to a very beautiful, divinely-armed child in the ultimate light
 devagy brahmanon ne us balak ke mastak par chakra chinh, lalaat par netra chinh tathaa skandh par shul chinh parilakshith kar use shiv avatar nirupit kiya or uskaa naam ‘shankar’ rakhaa
 Sri Shankaracharya Jayanti is celebrated every year to pay homage to these Shankaracharyaji to Vaishak Shukla Panchami
 jis samay jagadguru shankaracharya kaa aavirbhaav hua, us samay bharat main vaidic dharm mlaan ho rahaa tha tathaa maanavtaa bisar rahi thi, aise main acharya shankar maanav dharm ke bhaskar prakaash stambh banakar prakat hue
 In just 32 years of his life, he gave such vigorous power to Sanatan Dharma that all his faintness went away

 His father wanted him to get complete knowledge of Sanskrit
 parantu pita kii akaal mrityu hone se shaishvavastha main hi shankar ke sir se pita kii chhatrachhaaya uth gai or sara boj shankar ji kii mata ke kandhon par aa padaa
 But his mother did not lack in duty
 At the age of five years, his Yajnopavit was performed and sent to Gurukul to study the Vedas
 ye prarambh se hi pratibha sampann the, at: inaki pratibha se inke guru bhi behad chakit the
 The great talent-rich Shrutidhar Balak Shankar memorized texts like Vedas, Puranas, Upanishads, Ramayana, Mahabharata etc
 in just 2 years time
 tatpashchaat guru se sammanit hokar ghar laut aae or mata kii seva karne lage
 His maternal power was so unique that at his prayer the Alavai river, which flowed far away from his village, changed its course and started flowing near the village of Kaladi, which facilitated his mother in river bathing
 kuch samay baad inaki mata ne inke vivaah kii sochi
 But Acharya Shankar wanted to stay away from the mess of householder
 ek jyotishi ne janm-patri dekhakar bataaya bhi tha ki alpaayu main inaki mrityu kaa yoga he
 Knowing this, Acharya Shankar's spirit of public service had become strong by taking retirement
 sanyas ke liye unhone maan se hath kiya or balak shankar ne 7 varsh kii aayu main sanyas grahan kar liya
 Then to get the highest goal of life, he got out of the house with permission from the mother
 acharya shankar ke jivan kaa ek din--matashri aryamba ke jivan ke antim kshanon main unke paas pahunchne ke liye acharya shankar vagvaddh hai
 'kaal: This moment arises according to the principle of playing the game

 'hey, this is the river Alwai

 He freed me only after i got permission from my mother's retirement
 kitni vivashtaa thi anugna dete samay unke man main
 i am their only child
 vah bhi sanyasonmukh
 The state of descent of the lineage chain
 ekakini mata kii seva- sushruva kii samasya
 Even then they allowed me to retire
 'yahi sab sochate-sochate pahunch jate hai acharya apane ghar ke daravaaje par
 After getting Acharya's call, the housekeeper opens the door
 acharya sidhe pahonchte hai matrushaiya ke paas
 On seeing the son in the form of a monk, the tears of the mother's eyes start to slip
 isi kram me mata kaa praanant ho jaataa he
 The soul of Matashree was stuck waiting eagerly for his son
 idhar aankhe putr kaa darshan karti hai udhar duusare hi kshan praan apni nishkarshan kriya se unki kaaya ko shav kaa rup de dete hai
 Acharya Shankar has taken initiation of renunciation, he has become a transcendent
 shastranusaar ve agni sparsh nahin kar sakate
 In front of them, like a fierce religious Sursa, he stands face to face
 yadi ve matashri ko mukhaagni dete hai to sanyas dharm se chyut hote hai
 If they do not offer fire, the sons are dissuaded from religion
 kuch samay ke liye acharya kaa sanyasi chitt unke man se kudakar bhaag jaataa he
 The general mind gets replaced in its place
 matra shav ko dekhakar ve ek saamaanya maanav kii bhaanti vilkhane lagate hai
 They are lost in the past with the hands of Matashree
 sochate hai 'inhen haathon se meri itani seva kii thi
 Today these hands have become so dependent
 bachapan me purna nadi main ve inhen haathon se mujhe mel -mel kar nahalaati thi
 i used to run away to play with fellow kids while feeding
 ve mujhe daudkar pakad laati thim or inhen haathon se khilaati thim
 With these hands, she used to swim on my body daily
 jab pitashri kaa dehanth ho gaya to matashri menre man sahare apana shesh jivan bitaana chaahati thi
 But after i became a monk, she broke down completely
 mere abhaav main unka maatr ek hi kaary rah gaya tha, mrityu kii pratiksha
 'acharya Shankar descends from past to present
 isi samay grihasevika unke kaan main fusfusaati he,`matashri ke antyeshti kriya main aapke namboodiri parivaar ke log bhaag nahin lenge
 The reason for their non-cooperation is that they consider this act of yours as against scripture and against tradition
 kehete hai 'sanyasi jab grih tyaag kar detaa he to uskaa grih prapanch me lautnaa shaastra viruddh he
 Fire touch is completely forbidden for him
 ham log aise shaastra viruddh kaary main acharya shankar kaa saath nahin de sakate
 Acharya gets excited for a moment after listening to Sevika
 unki samaj main nahin aata he ki akele ve mata kaa shav lekar shmashaan tak kaise jaayenge
 For some time they become confused
 sahasaa unke man main ek samaadhaan kaundhta he
 'if the funeral of the mother's body is not taken at the crematorium, if the funeral is done in the house premises itself, what can be the objection? ʼ aisa kuch bhav acharya ke man main aata he
 Sagotri people are enjoying the dilemma of Acharya from a distance
 vipatti ke in kshanon main koi unka saath nahin detaa he
 Finally, Acharya Shankar decorates the pyre in front of his house
 kisi tarah mata ke shav ko chita par sthapit karte hai
 Taking a fire pitcher in his hand, orbiting the pyre, he lit the body
 acharya grih parisar ko hi shmashanghar me parivartit kar dete hai
 Looking at the flames from the pyre, Acharya feels as if Agni Dev is marching towards Pitraloka with his mother's subtle body
 kramshah chita kii lapten shant ho jaati hai par acharya kaa man apane sagotriyo ke liye khinn ho jaataa he
 Think, in such heavy calamities, our sagotrios did not take out a word of sympathy from the mouth
 acharya shankar kii isi maansikta se ek shaap shabd hota he,"ab is gotra ke log meri tarah shavadah shmashaan ghat par na karke apane ghar ke saamne hi karenge
 According to the 'mrisha na ho devi sage vani' doctrine, in the Namboodari Brahmins in the village of Kalati in Kerala, the corpse is still performed in front of the house
 ve kerala se lambii padayatra karke narmada nadi ke tat par sthit omkarnath pahunche
 There, Guru Gobindapad began to receive yoga education and Advaita Brahman knowledge
 teen varsh tak acharya shankar advait tatv kii sadhana karte rahe
 After that, with the permission of Guru, he went out to see Kashi Vishwanath
 jab ve kaashi ja rahe the ki ek chandal unki raah main aa gaya
 When he got angry and asked Chandal to move away, Chandal said- 'O Muni! You are neglecting a divine being who is in the body, therefore you are a Abraham
 atev mere maarg se aap hat jaayen
 Acharya Shankar, listening to Chandaval's devani, was very impressed and said - "you have given me knowledge, so you have become my guru
" ’ yah kahkar acharya shankar ne unhen pranaam kiya to chandal ke sthaan par shiv tathaa chaar devon ke unhen darshan hue
 During a few days stay in Kashi, he went to meet Acharya Mandan Mishra in the city of Mahishmati
 acharya mishra ke ghar jo paaltu maina thi vah bhi veda mantron kaa uccharan karti thi
 Acharya Shankar went to Mishraji's house and defeated him in scripture
 pati acharya mishra ko harata dekh patni acharya shankar se boleen- ‘mahatman! abhi aapane aadhe hi ang ko jeeta he
 Only by defeating me with your tips will you be called victorious
 ’ Then Bharti, the wife of Mishraji, started questioning Kamasastra
 kintu acharya shankar to bal-brahmacharee the, at: kaam se sambandhit unke prashnon ke uttar kahan se dete? is par unhone bharti devi se kuch dinon kaa samay maanga tathaa par-kaaya main pravesh kar us vishay kii sari jaankaree praapt kii
 After this Acharya Shankar also defeated Bharti in debate
 kaashi main pravaas ke dauraan unhone or bhi bade-bade gyani panditon ko shastrarth main parrast kiya or guru pad par pratishthit hue
 Many disciples took initiation from him
 iske baad ve dharm kaa prachaar karne lage
 He also composed many texts while engaging in Vedanta propaganda
 advait brahmavaadi acharya shankar keval nirvishesh brahm ko satya maanate the or brahmagyaan main hi nimagn rahete the
 Once he was going to Manikarnika Ghat with his disciples to bathe in a very narrow street in Brahma Muhurta
 raste main ek yuvati apane mrit pati kaa sir god main liye vilaap karti hui baithi thi
 The disciples of Acharya Shankar prayed to the woman to remove her husband's body and give it a way, but the woman continued to cry by ignoring him
 tab swayan acharya ne usase vah shav hataane kaa anurodh kiya
 Hearing his request, the woman said- 'O sannyasin! You are repeatedly asking me to remove this body
 aap is shav ko hi hat jane ke liye kyon nahin kehete?’ yah sunakar acharya bole- ‘he devi! aap shok main kadaachit yah bhi bhul gai ki shav main swayan hatane kii shakti hi nahin he
 'the woman immediately replied-' Mahatma, in your eyes, Brahm, the absolute power, is the doer of the world
 phir shakti ke bina yah shav kyon nahin hat saktaa?’ us stri kaa aisa gambhir, gyaanamay, rahasypurna vaakya sunakar acharya vahiin baith gaye
 He found a tomb
 ant:chakshu main unhone dekha- sarvatra aadyashakti mahamaya lila vilaap kar rahi hai
 His heart was filled with inexplicable joy and the wordy word of maternal veneration from the mouth burst into stotra
 ab acharya shankar aise mahaasaagar ban gaye, jisamen advaitvaad, shuddhadvaitvaad, vishishta dwaitvaad, nirgun brahm gyaan ke saath sagun saakaar kii bhakthi kii dharaayen ek saath hiloren lene lageen
 He realized that the divine, nirguna on the advaita land of knowledge is the formless brahm, the same is true on the land of dvaita
 unhone nirgun or sagun donon kaa samarthan karke nirgun tak pahunchne ke liye sagun kii upasna ko aprihaary seedhi mana
