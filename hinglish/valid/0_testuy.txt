 Osteoporosis is most common in post-menopausal women, when it is called post-menopausal osteoporosis, but it can also develop in men and can be caused by specific hormonal disorders and other chronic illnesses in anyone or drugs, especially glucocorticoids
 Can result when the disease is steroid or glucocorticoid-induced osteoporos Number called

 Osteoporosis can be prevented with lifestyle changes and sometimes medications; Treatment for people with osteoporosis can include both
 jivan-style badalane main vyaayaam or girane se rokna shaamil hai; dawaaiyon main calcium, vitamin di, bisafosphonet or kai anya shaamil hai
 Exercises to stretch walking muscles, tissue-sensory-correction exercises, in fall prevention advice; Balance therapy may be included
 vyaayaam, apane upachayi prabhaav ke saath, osteoporosis ko usee samay band yaa ulat saktaa he
 In all cases of osteoporosis, the underlying system is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation

 As Frost first reported in 1963, this process occurs in bone multicellular units
 asthishoshak koshikaon dwaara asthi kaa avasorana hota he, jiske baad nai asthi asthikorak koshikaon dwaara jamaa kii jaati he
 The three major mechanisms by which bone weakness develops are insufficient head bone mass, excessive bone absorption, and insufficient formation of new bone during regeneration
 At the core of delicate bone tissue development is the interaction of these three mechanisms
 Hormonal factors specifically determine the rate of bone absorption; Estrogen deficiency increases bone resorption and, at the same time, reduces the deposition of new bone, usually in weight-bearing bones
 is prakriya ko dabaane ke liye apekshit estrogen kii maatra, aam taur par garbhashay or stan granthi ko uttejit karne ke liye apekshit maatra se kam he
 The estrogen receptor of the Î±-form seems to be very important in the regulation of bone manipulation

 The vulvascular bone is the rigid outer shell of the bones and the middle of the long bones
 kyonki asthikorak or asthishoshak, haddiyon kii sataha par nivas karte hai, bandhakmay asthi zyaada sakriy he or asthi ke her-pher or punarpratirupan ke adheen he
 Not only is bone density low, but bone micro-structures are disrupted
 bandhakmay asthi kamazor conticaayen bhang ho jaati hai or kamazor haddiyon se pratisthapit hoti hai
 Common osteoporotic fracture sites, such as the wrist, hip and spinal cord, have a relatively high ratio of vulvar bone to ligamentous bone

 Osteoporosis has no specific symptoms of its own; The main consequence of this is the increased risk of fractures
 osteoporotic fracture un sthitiyon main hote hai, jahaan aam taur par swasth logon kii haddi nahin tuutati he; atah unhen najuk asthi-bhang mana jaataa hai
 Typical delicate fractures occur in the vertebral column, rib, hip, and wrist

 Additionally, there are specific diseases and disorders in which osteoporosis is an accepted problem
 dawa kaa prayog saidhantik rup se parivartaneey he, haalanki kai maamalon main osteoporosis ke jokhim ko badhaane vaali dawaaon kaa upyog aprihaary he
 The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are advanced age and female gender; Estrogen deficiency after menopause correlates with a rapid decrease in bone mineral density, whereas a decrease in testosterone levels in men has a comparable effect
 haalanki osteoporosis sabhi jaateey samoohon ke logon main paaya jaataa he, europea yaa asian mul ke log osteoporosis ke prati pehle se hi pravrutt hai
 People who have a family history of fractures or osteoporosis are at greater risk; The heritability of fractures and low bone mineral density is relatively high, with an expansion ranging from 25 to 80 percent
 osteoporosis ke vikaas se jude kam se kam 30 jin maujuud hai
 People who have already had a fracture are twice as likely to have a fracture again than someone who is same or gay

 Osteoporosis is diagnosed by measuring bone mineral density
 dohari urja eks-re avasoranamapi sarvaadhik prachlit vidhi he
 In addition to detecting abnormal BMD, a diagnosis of osteoporosis requires investigation into potentially variable underlying causes; This can be done with blood tests and X-rays

 This is called a T-score
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne nimnlikhit disha-nirdeshon ko sthapit kiya he: The term "severe or established" osteoporosis is used when there is also osteoporotic fracture, which is defined as a fall from a steep elevation
 naidanik ghanatvamaapi antarrashtriya samiti kii manyata he ki 50 varsh se kam umr ke purushon main osteoporosis kaa nidaan akele ghanatvamaapan mandandon ke aadhaar par nahin kiya janaa chahie

 Many drugs are used to treat osteoporosis on the basis of gender
 jivan-style main parivartan bhi upachaar kaa ek pahalu he
 Bisphosphonate is the main medicinal remedy for treatment
 baharhaal, 1990 ke dashak main terriparatide or stronsium rinlate jaisi nai dawaaen prakat huin
 In the case of confirmed osteoporosis, bisphosphonate drugs have been the first in the treatment-preference order of women
 saamanytah nuskhe main shaamil bisafasphonet hai presently ke anusaar sodium alendronet 10 mg prati din yaa saptaah main ek baar 70 mg, rycedronet 5 mg prati din yaa saptaah main ek baar 35 mg or yaa ibendronet maheene main ek baar
 a 2007 manufacturer-supported study reported that in patients with low-impact hip fractures, the annual transfusion of 5 mg of zoledronic acid increased the risk of any fracture by 35%, the risk of vertebral fracture from 3
8% to 1
7%
 And reduced the risk of non-vertebral fractures from 10
7% to 7

 Oral bisphosphonates are relatively poorly absorbed and therefore should be taken on an empty stomach, where no food or drink is taken for the next 30 minutes
 It is associated with inflammation of the esophagus and is therefore sometimes tolerated; a weekly or monthly dose reduces the likelihood of esophagitis and is now standardized
 haalanki zolandronet jaise antahshira nuskhon ke saath aantrayik khuraaq maukhik sahishnutaa kii samasyaon kaa parihaar hota he, lekin ye kaarak jabade kaa asthigalan naamak ek durlabh lekin apriy mukh-rog main pradhan rup se antargrast hai
 For this reason, oral bisphosphonate therapy should probably be preferred and now doctors recommend that any curative dental work be done before treatment
 haal hi main, terriparatide ko osteoporosis ke prati prabhavi hona paaya gaya he
 It acts as a parathyroid hormone and stimulates osteoblasts and thus increases their activity
 yah zyaadaatar haddiyon kii kamazori se pusht rogiyon ke liye, visheshtah kam BMD yaa kai fracture ke jokhim kaarak vaale yaa jo maukhik biophasphonet bardaasht nahin kar sakate, istemaal kiya jaataa he
 It is given as a daily injection with the use of an injection device such as a pen
 kuch deshon main, terriparatide ko upachaar ke liye tabhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, yadi biophasphonet asafal ho jate hai yaa nishiddh hai
 Patients or young patients with prior radiation therapy or Paget's disease should avoid this medicine
 maukhik stronsium rinlate ek vaikalpik maukhik ilaaj he, jo dawaaon ke ek aise varg se sambandhit he, jise uske nirmaataa ne 'dohari karrwai haddi agent" naam diya he
 It has proved its ability in the prevention of vertebral fractures in particular
 prayogshaala prayogon main note kiya gaya ki stronsium rinlate asthikorkon ke prasar ko badhaava, saath hi asthibhanjakon ke prasar ko pratibandhit karata he
 Strontium renalate is taken as an oral suspension of 2g daily and is licensed for the treatment of osteoporosis to prevent vertebral and hip fractures
 bisphosphonet kii tulana main stronsium rinlate ko anushanbee prabhaav laabh hasil he, kyonki yah kisi tarah kaa upree GI anushanbee prabhaav nahin paidaa karata, jo ki haddiyon kii kamajori main dawa hataa liye jane kaa sabase aam kaaran he
 Studies have noted a slight increase in the risk of venous thrombosis, the cause of which has not been determined
 isse pataa chalata he ki yah alag kaarnon se ghanaastrata ke jokhim se grast rogiyon main kam upyukt ho saktaa he
 The leaching of strontium in place of calcium in the bone matrix indicates a substantial and mismatched increase in bone mineral density measured at DXA, making it difficult to interpret the addition of bone density by this method for patients treated with strontium
 ek sudhaar elgoritham taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Although strontium renalate is effective, its use has not yet been approved in the United States
 tathaapi, america main kai nami vitamin nirmaataaon se stronsium citrate uplabdh he
 Most researchers believe that strontium, regardless of its use, is safe and effective
 rinlate prakaar france ke sarvier company dwaara avishkrut keval ek saadhan he, taaki ve stronsium ke apane sanskaran ko patent kar saken
 Strontium, whatever its form, must be soluble in water and ionized in abdominal acid
 Strontium is then protein-bound to be carried by the intestinal tract into the bloodstream
 sodium alendronet jaisi aushadhiyon ke vipareet, stronsium asthi punahchaalan ko baadhit nahin karata or, vastav main, majboot haddiyon kaa utpaadan ho saktaa he
 Studies have shown that alendronate may also be a factor of bone loss after five years, while strontium continues to form bone from application during life
 stronsium ko aahaar yaa calcium yukt vyanjanon ke saath nahin lenaa chahie, kyonki udagrahan ke dauraan calcium kii pratispardhaa stronsium ke saath hoti he
 Nevertheless, it is important to take calcium, magnesium, and vitamin d in therapeutic amounts daily, but not while taking strontium
 Strongium should be taken empty stomach at night
 osteoporosis kii rokthaam ke liye estrogen pratisthaapan upachaar ek acha ilaaj he, lekin is samay, jab tak ki uske istemaal ke liye anya sanket uplabdh naa hon, uski sifaarish nahin kii jaati he
 There is uncertainty and controversy regarding the recommendation of estrogen in the first decade after menopause in women

 aahaar kaa seven badhaane ke liye calcium poorak istemaal kiye ja sakate hai or puure din kai choti kuraaken lene ke madhyam se avasorana anukulit kiya ja saktaa he
 The role of calcium in preventing and treating osteoporosis is unclear - some populations with very low calcium levels also have extremely low bone fracture rates and bone mass in others with high rates of calcium ingested through milk and milk products - The rate of dissolution is high
 osteoporosis ke vikaas main kai anya karkon ke bich khaane main calcium ko ek kaarak banaate hue, protein, namak or vitamin d kaa seven, vyaayaam or surya ke prakaash se sampark jaise anya sabhi kaarak, asthi khanij ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 In 2007, a WHO report stated that eating calcium along with acidic adulteration with diet affected bone weakness
 
 a mid-analysis of randomized controlled trials involving calcium and calcium and vitamin d supported the use of high levels of calcium and vitamin D, although the results varied depending on the criteria used to assess bone health
 a mid-analysis with another study supported significantly better outcomes for patients with best adherence to the treatment protocol
 iske vipareet, calcium purakon main unnat ucch lepoprotein kii saghanta kii pichhali report ke baavjood, kii dar main sambhavit vruddhi pai gai
 If confirmed, this indicates that calcium supplementation in women at low risk of fracture may cause more harm than good

 The "police" there return Sajan and Kajal to Dhanraj

 Years later, Warrior editor Days Skin reportedly invited Moore to create a dark mysterious black series with artists such as David Lloyd

 Moore and Lloyd both conceived a series of dark adventure adventures inspired by the characters of the 1960s British comic decade, as well as the concept of a Marvel UK series influenced by Knight Raven, to which Lloyd was very The author had already worked with Steve Parkhaus

 Britain's political milieu also influenced the composition in the early 1980s, with Moore's belief that the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher would "lose the 1983 election" and that the Labor Party government, led by Michael Foote, would completely Committed to nuclear disarmament, after a limited nuclear war, the United Kingdom will be saved relatively safe
 However, Moore felt that the fascists would soon bring post-destruction Britain to the brink of destruction
 Moore's landscape remains untested

 In this series, Moore uses the first of the most detailed descriptions and currents of multidimensional plotting that will be fully distinguishable in Watchmen

 In this story, two opposing political views of anarchy and fascism contradict each other

 As in most fascist regimes, there are many state organizations that clash with each other in power struggles while obeying the same leader's command

 An important aspect of collective federalism is the identification of the society with the state, and if the society is treated as one body, then various institutions of the state will be considered as different components of the body
 These are reflected by entities named after body parts: the intelligence branch of the police is named The Nose; The Year and} The Eye { / 1 are the names of surveillance organizations, the Uniform Branch of Police {1} is The Finger; ) And state-controlled media known as The Mouth

 Much of the story is told from the point of view of other characters: Vee's fan and apprentice Evie, a sixteen-year-old factory worker, Eric Finch, a world-weary practical cop who is looking for Vee, and a fascist under party There are many other contenders for power within the party itself

 Moore never explicitly revealed who v is allegedly, only stating that Vee Eevee's father is not Whistler's mother, or Charlie's aunt "; he has repeatedly made this explanation
 That V's identity has never been revealed in the story
 ve ke charitra kii aspashtataa kaary ke madhyam se nirantar jari vishay-vastu he; yah pathakon par chhod diya gaya he ki ve swatah tay karen ki ve swasthchitt he yaa manorogi, nayak yaa khalanaayak he gaay fox kaa mukhauta pahanane se pehle ivi is niskarsh par pahunchati he ki ve kii pahchaan uski adaa kii gai bhoomikaaon kii tulana main naganya he kyonki uski pahchaan apane aap main vichaaron kaa saakaar pratik he
 This lack of humanization through a certain identity is inferred that the creation of this character in every person is exemplified by personal responsibility as determined from the Puri book

 In fixed mechanics, Euler's rotational equations describe the rotational motion of fast objects with the help of the rotational instruction system
 isamen jo ghurni frem liya jaataa he uskaa aksh us pind se judaa hua tathaa pind ke mukhya jadtv akshon ke samaantar hota he
 Euler equations are simple quasi-linear first-order equations in vector
 islar samikarnon kaa saamaanya rup nimnlikhit he- Where m is the thrust applied, i is the inertial matrix, Ï is the angular velocity relative to the principal axes
 3D mukhya lambkonik akshon main uparokt samikarnon kaa nimnlikhit rup ho jaataa he- Where Mk is the component of the charged force M, Ik is the component of principal inertial moment axis i and Ïk is the direction of the principal axes

 yadhyapi yah niyam saarvbhaumik satya he, yah samaanya ghurni drudh pind kii gati ke liye hal karne main hameshaa sahaayak nahin he
 Since both Iin and Ï can change during movement
 atah ham nirdesh tantra ko is tarah parivartit karte hai ki vah ghurni pind ke saath sthir rahe or is tarah se chayan karte hai ki isaki aksh jadtwaghurna pradeesh kii disha main sthit hon
 In this reference system, at least the inertial display is fixed, which facilitates calculation
 jaisaa kii jadtwaghurna main samajhaayaa gaya he, koniya samveg Where Mk, Ik and Ïk are as described above
 ghurni nirdesh tantra main, samay avkalaj ko Should be replaced with jahaan adholikhit "rot" ghurni nirdesh tantra ko nirupit kar rahaa he
 In the inertial and rotational reference systems, the expression related to the problem is: jahaan q ghurni pradeesh he, jo kisi koniya veg sadish v se sambandhit lamb koniya pradeesh he In the front diagram, a billiard ball with r radius, m mass and i inertia is hit parallel to the table in such a way that the ball moves forward without sliding on the table
 ham isamen yah jaananaa chaahate hai ki gend ke aadhaar se kis oonchaai par bal f lagaaya jaay taaki koi gharshan bal na hone ke vaavjood gend bina phisale, ludhakte hue aage bad jaay
 The force m = - f of the force exerted in the horizontal direction produces rotational acceleration in the ball - yahan balaghurna rinatmak liya gaya he kyonki yah ghurnan kone Ï ke vipareet he 
 In addition to this equation, the force f applied to the ball causes an acceleration in its center of mass
 atah Note that the acceleration x Ì { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}}} is parallel to the table and in the direction of the force
 bina-sarake ludhakne ke liye aavashyak he ki- Thus all the above equations describe the motion of the ball in three variables h, Ï, and x
 in samikarnon ko milakar hal karte hue hamen nimnlikhit jaankaree milti he- The inertia of a solid, homogeneous sphere is i = 2 5 mr 2 { \ displaystyle i = { \ tfrac {2} {5}} mr ^ {2}}
 yah maan rakhane par- r a wheel with radius, m mass and i inertia is rotating at a constant inclination at an angle Î± with the speed of gravitational acceleration g
 
 As this wheel is also shifting, linear acceleration of its mass is also taking place
 is samasya main ham yah maan rahe hai ki pahiye kii gati bina sarake ho rahi he
 Hence a frictional force r is produced between the plane and the wheel which rotates the wheel, because this force causes a fouling m = -r R
 yah balaghurna rinatmak liya gaya he kyonki yah ghurnan kone Ï ke vipareet he
 Hence the following is the equation of the rotational speed of the wheel
 ab pahiye ke dravyaman kendra ke visthaapan par vichaar karte hai
 The value of element f in the direction of the plane of mass of the wheel, mg is f = mgsin
 yah bal gharshan bal ke ulti disha main kaary kar rahaa he
 So according to Newton's second law of motion - jahaan x Ì { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}}} pahiye kaa nat-samtal ke samaantar twaran he
 Also, if the rolling motion is unfixed then x Ì = - r Ï Ì { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}} = - r { \ ddot { \ varphi}}}
 is prakaar hamane teen agyaat raashiyon R, Ï tathaa x ko samete hue gati ke sameekaran praapt kar liye
 On solving these equations, we get isse yah dekha ja saktaa he ki kisi diye hue nat-kone Î± ke liye, adhiktam twaran tab hota he jab pahiye kaa dravyaman adhik-se-adhik uske aksh ke nikat ho
 
 dhyaan dijiye ki isi nat-samtal par, yadi gharshan shunya ho to, us par sarak rahe kisi pind kaa twaran x Ì = g sin â¡ { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}}=g \ sin} hoga, jo pahiye ke twaran se adhik he
 The reason for this is that the potential energy of the wheel is turning into two types of kinetic energy - the kinetic energy of rotation and the kinetic energy of transfer of center of mass; Whereas the moving body has only one kinetic energy - the kinetic energy of the center of mass transfer

 Since the French Revolution, when Saint Genevieve disinfected the Church of Paris and converted it into a secular monument, it became the Parisian world sanctuary, from the same time any building where a famous deceased was honored or buried
 Gaya, the general term for it, is being used as the World Council

 Located in Campus Meritus, at the time of its construction, the area of the World Temple was on the outskirts of Rome, whose surroundings were rural
 roman ganatantr ke tahat campus martius chunaav ke samay or sena ke ekatrit hone ke kaam aata tha
 However, both of these came to be considered unnecessary during the time of Augustus and the new Raj
 The construction of the World Temple was a part of the construction program which was taken up by Augustus Caesar and his supporters
 unhone campus martius main bees se adhik sanrachanaon kaa nirmaan kiya jisamen agrippa kaa snanaghar or septa julia bhi shaamil he
 For a long time it was believed that this building was built by Agrippa, which was later changed and this part was included because it had an inscription in front of the temple
 haalanki, puratathvik khudaai se pataa chalaa he ki agrippa kaa vishwa devalayas puri tarah se nasht ho gaya tha or shaayad samraat hadrian ne agrippa ke mul mandir kii jagah par vishwa devalayas ke punarnirmaan kii jimmedaari lee thi
 The structure of Agrippa's world shrine is often debated
 19 veen shatabdi main khudaai ke parinamswaroop, puratatvavid rhodolpho lancian ne nishkarsh nikaala he ki agrippa kaa vishwa devalayas is tarah se banaaya gaya tha ki vah dakshin kii ore se khulaa ho, iske vipareet vartmaan dhaanche main vah uttar kii ore he or "tii" ke aadhaar par dwaar ke saath isamen ek sankshipt tii-aakaar yojana thi
 This description was widely accepted by the end of the 20th century
 haalanki, haal hi main kii gayi puratathvik khudaayiyon se pataa chalata he ki vah imaarat ek alag rup kii ho sakati thi
 The world shrine of Agrippa could have been circular in shape with a triangular antechamber and could also have been open from the north side, like the later rebuilt buildings

 Therefore, the design of the building should not be attributed to Hadrian or his architect
 Instead, the design of the existing building may be related to Apolodorus of Damascus, the architect of Trajan

 It was finished by Hadrian but claimed not to include it in his works, but rather in the original inscription of the main gate, as in all reconstruction plans made by Hadrian in Rome
 How this building was built is not yet known

 Replacement of the building as a church saved it from being abandoned, destroyed, and worse, as with most buildings in ancient Rome during the early medieval period

 Although Italy has become a republic since 1946, volunteer members of Italian monarchist organizations continue to monitor the royal mausoleums located in the world sanctuary
 It has been opposed from time to time by republicanists, although the Italian Cultural Heritage Ministry is in charge of maintenance and safety, but the practice continued with the permission of the Catholic authorities
