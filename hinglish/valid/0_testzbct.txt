 The credit for popularizing the modern street theater in India goes to Safdar Hashmi
 unke janm diwas 12 april ko deshbhar main rashtriya nukkad naatak diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 Thus, drama and theater started in the open, that is, the nook was the first place used in the play of plays
 aadim yug main sab log din bhar kaam se thak jane ke baad manoranjan ke liye kahi khule main ek gheraa banaakar baith jate the or us ghere ke bichon-bich hi unka bhojan pakataa rahata, khan-paan hota or vahi baad main naachna-gaanaa hota
 Thus the process also involved the presence of three essential elements associated with street plays from the beginning - an enclosure as a performance venue, the intimate connection between the audience and actors, and the stories, events and events directly related to the audience's everyday life
 Staging plays
 madhyakaal main sahi rup main nukkad naatakon se milti-julati natya-style kaa janm or vikaas bharat ke vibhinn praanton, kshetron or boliyon-bhashaaon main lok naatakon ke rup main hua
 Parallel to this, in the West too, such plays started in the countries of England, France, Germany and Spain etc
 which were based on biblical events
 aadhunik yug main jis rup main ham nukkad naatakon ko jaanate he, unka itihaas bharat ke swadhinata sangram ke dauraan kaumi taraanon, prabhaat feriyon or virodh ke juluson ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 a methodical form of this came in the form of the birth of an institution like IPTA, when people from different art mediums came together across India and started protesting against foreign rule and power through staging and demonstrations of revolutionary songs, plays and dances
 Happened

 Sometimes it was the promotion of stories, sometimes religion and sometimes political ideology
 kisi bhi yug or kaal main is tathy ko rekhaankit kar sakate hai
 Today, big commercial-business companies are using street plays to promote their products, the government system uses mediums such as street plays to propagate their policies and directives and political parties will be able to use their party on election days
 People are attracted to this mode for publicity

 It took time for drama to be established as a cultural genre in the field of drama
 aarambh main sahitya or naatakon ke vidwaanon ne nukkad naatak ko shastreey natya-vidha ke rup main sweekaar karne sankoch prakat kiya
 It was placed in the category of folk theater but during the last three decades street plays became very popular and many well-known playwrights and theater personalities joined it
 sach to yah he ki nukkad naatakon ne paaramparik rangamanchi naatakon ko bhi kaaphi prabhavit kar diya he
 This form of theatrical performance helps in establishing direct communication with the public
 isamen drishy parivartan nahin hota or kalakaar vibhinn sanketon ke madhyam se isaki soochna dete hai, jise darshak aasaani se samaj jate hai
 Nukkad plays are usually very precise and concise as it is not possible to keep the audience watching the drama on the side of the road for a long time
 swargeey safadar hashmi ek vikhyath rangakarmi the, jinhone nukkad naatakon ko ek deshvyapee pahchaan dilaane main sabase mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 He was killed a few years ago
 unhone nukkad naatakon ke madhyam se anek jwalanth muddon ko prabhavi tareeke se aam janata ke saamne laane kaa kaam bakhubi kiya
 The popularity and development of street plays is evident from the fact that some three decades ago, the street drama 'aurat' played by the drama troupe of 'jan Natya Manch' had gained a lot of fame in the Hindi speaking area
 1980 i0 ke pehle hi is naatak ke saikadon pradarshan ho chuke the
 It has had thousands of protests over the years and has also made several presentations in neighboring countries Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan
 aaj nukkad naatak lokapriyata kii us paraakaashtha par he jahaan filmein bhi apane prachaar ke liye nukkad naatak kaa sahyog le rahi hai

 mimasaa darshan hinduon ke chah darshanon main se ek he
 Mimamsa is the name of the venerated meaning of Vedavakyas regarding the opposition
 ukt vichaar purv arya parampara se chalaa aayaa he
 But almost a quarter of five thousand years ago, the disciple of Samveda's Krishna Dvaipayana formulated it
 sutron main pur paksh or siddhanth ke rup main baadaraayan, baadari, aatreya, ashmarathy, aalekhan, etishaayan, kaamukayan, karshnajini ar labukayan maharishiyon kaa ullekh miltaa he, jiskaa vistrut vivechan sutron ke bhashya ar vaarthik main kiya gaya he, jinase sahasraadhikaran ho gaye hai
 This scripture is also known as Purvimamsa and Vedant's Uttermimamsa
 purmamimasaa main dharm kaa vichaar he ar uttarmimasaa main brahm kaa
 Therefore, the Dharmamimamsa of the East and the North, and the north-east is also called the Brahmanimansa
 jaimini muni dwaara rachit sutara hane se mimasaa kaa jaimineey dharmamimasaa kaha jaataa he
 The German scholar Maxmüller states that - "this philosophy cannot come in the category of philosophy, because it only discusses religion
 isamen jeev, ishwar, bandha, moksh or unke sadhano kaa kahin bhi vivechan nahin he
 " maxmooler mat ke pakshpaati kuch bhartiya vidvan bhi ise darshan kehane main sankoch karte hai, kyonki nyaay, vaisheshik, sankhya, yoga or vedant main jis prakaar tat tat prakarnon main pramaan or pramayon ke dwaara aatma-anatma, bandha-moksh aadi kaa mukhya rup se vivechan miltaa he, vaisaa mimasaa darshan ke sutara, bhashya or vaarthik aadi main drushtigochar nahin hota
 The above thinkers have expressed their views after studying the scripture with a gross intellect
 phir bhi spasht he ki mimasaa darshan hi sabhi darshanon kaa sahyogi kaaran he
 Jaimini has novelized these subjects in his sutra form "satsamprayoga Purushyasendriyanam Budhi Jan Tat Tatam" In the fourth sutra two words have come - Purusha and Wisdom
 purush shabd se "aatma" hi vivakshit he
 This meaning is written by Kumaril Bhatt in "bhattadipika"
 buddhi shabd se gyaan, pramaata, prameya or pramaan arth ko vyakt kiya gaya he
 The Vrittikar has given a detailed explanation of the direct, inferential words, meaning and unavoidable evidences in the three sutras to "tasya nimitta parishti:" in his lecture and a special discussion of subjectivism in the justified sutra
 isi kaa vishleshan shabar bhashya, shloke vaarthik, shastradipika, bhatt chintamani aadi granthon main kiya gaya he jisamen pramaan or pramayon kaa bhed, bandha, moksh or unke sadhano kaa bhi vivechan he
 In the philosophy of Mimamsa, the ideas of Varnashrama system, Adhanadi, Ashwamedhant etc
 have been discussed in the main life of religion of India
 praaia: vishwa main gyani or virakt purush sarvatra hote aae hai, kintu dharmacharan ke saakshaat falwetta or karmkand ke prakand vidvan bharatvarsh main hi hue hai
 Among them, the texts of Maharishi such as Katyayan, Ashwalayan, Apastamb, Bodhayan, Gautam etc
 are available even today
 
 The Indian ritual ritual theory receives redemption and support in this philosophy
 dow kunnan raja ne "brihati" ke dwitiya sanskaran kii bhoomika main iskaa samuchit rup se nirupan kiya he
 Although the name of religion is mentioned in Kanad Muni's vaheesic philosophy - it is not considered further
 kisi vidvan kaa kahana he - That is, just as a man goes into the Himalayas, desirous of going out to sea, in the same way, Kanad Muni, who was interested in lectures of religion, went on discussing the matter
 uttar mimasaa ke siddhant ke anusaar karmatyag ke pashchaat hi atmagyaan prapti kaa adhikaar he, kintu purv mimasaa darshan ke anusaar - According to this Vedamantra, Mumukshu people should also do karma
 vedavihit karm karne se karmbandhan swat: samaapt ho jaataa he - tasmanmumukshubhih kaary nityam naimittikan tathaa" aadi vachanon ke anusaar bhartiya aastik darshanon kaa mukhya praan mimasaa darshan he
 The Mimamsa philosophy is of sixteen chapters, with twelve chapters in order
 shastrasangati, adhyaysangati, padasngati or adhikarasangatiyon se susambaddha he
 What has been missed in these twelve chapters is represented in the remaining four chapters, which is famous as 'sankarsakand'
 usamen devtaa ke adhikaar kaa vivechan kiya gaya he
 Therefore, it is also called 'devata Kand' or can be called an appendix of two chapters
 bhaskar raay dikshit ne sankarshan cond kii vyakhya ke ant main likhaa he ki shodashadhai mimasaa ke rahete hue bhi pathnpathan madhya kaal main dwadashadhyay kaa hi hota tha
 Just as the scholarly class chants Tripada Gayatri even when Chatupada Gayatri is living, similarly in the present day, the study of Dwadashadhyayi Mimamsa is the only teaching
 kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar mimasaa ke bina vaakyarth kaa nirnay karnaa kathin he, kyonki amuk vaakya upasthit arth main pramaan he athwa anya arth main, is vichaar ke nirnay main jo nishkarsh aata he use mimasaa kaha gaya he, kintu yahan mimasaa shabd kaa arth darshan se he
 The idea of the meaning of non-contradictory Vedamantras for theology is called Mimamsa
 or vichaarpurvak praapt dharmagyaan mimasaa kaa fal he
 This is what Jamini has said in his philosophy of philosophy - that is, curiosity of religion

 Kumaril Bhatt described it as - aage vaakyarth nirnyopayogi sahasron nyaayon kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 Even six chapters have a brief theme
 is darshan main praptaprapt vivek nyaay se, athwa adagdh dahan nyaay se uddeshy vidhey bhav kaa vichaar kar veda-vaakyarth-nirnay se kartavya-akartavya kaa gyaan hota he
 Therefore, theology is the object of philosophy
 is darshan main dharmavichaar se upkram he
 Sanskrit literature is used in grammar for "grammar", grammatical justice, and "syntax" for epistemology
 is shaastra main hi dharmavichaar kii charchaa hai
 The main objective of the Indian public is religious worship
 anushthan fal ke bina nahin ho saktaa or falsaadhanta bhi saadhan saamagree ke bina nahin ho sakati
 Therefore, in short the means are also discussed
 anushthan ke purv dharm kaa lakshan, pramaan or saadhan fal jaananaa aavashyak he
 In this shastra, means, organs and balances are all three synonyms
 aise hi saadhy, sheshi or angi ye teenon paryaayavachi hai
 For example, if you want to perform the ritual of Darshan Purnamas for the attainment of heaven, then Darshan and Purnamas will be Angi and Prayas will be part of it
 darsh yag amavasya tithi ko or poornmaas yag poornima tithi ko hota he
 ) In this, the organ is the prime organ sponsor and the organ is usable
 is prakaar dharmaprapti ke sadhano ko jaanakar anushthan ke liye paurvapary kaa bhi gyaan apekshit he evam fal ke liye anushthey agni hotradi karmon ke prakaran main purvang or uttarang sadhano kaa bhi vivechan he, jinke liye "prakruti" shabd kaa prayog hota he
 But there is no recitation of the Anga in the Sannidhi of the solar day
 us sthal par aakanksha ke udai hone par darsh poornmaas main pratipaadit angon ko lenaa hota he jise atidesh kehete hai
 
 saamaanya rup se nirnay hone par bhi kis karm se kis karm main ang kaa aagaman hota he, iskaa vivechan visheshatidesh se kaha gaya he
 In spite of the excesses of the limbs, due to the difference in nature, the text is read in place of Prakrit
 udaahranarth "agney twa jushta nirvpaami"
 In this Shrutivakya, by placing the Suryapada of "suryohyeshti" in place of fire post, "surya Tvajushtam Nirvapami" recites this shruti
 aise vaakya ko "ooh" kehete hai
 Without the knowledge of these things, it is not possible to understand which parts should be used where and how, so that the ritual can be properly fruitful
 jis sthal par ang pathit na ho vahaan anya sthal se ang laana chahie, kintu jo vikruti yag ke upkaar kar sakate hon ve hi prakruti main liye ja sakate hai
 Those who cannot do favors in deformity, there is no recitation of other organs
 or unka anushthan bhi nahin hota
 Such words are called "obstructions"
 kis ang kaa baadh hota he or kiskaa nahin, iskaa nirnay "ooh" baadh ke adheen he
 And the desired fruitful karma is only one
 kintu kahin kahin anek bhi hote hai
 Some organs are ritualized before the head and some are also performed after the head
 udaahranarth samidheni prayajadi tathaa swisht krit anuyajadi
 It has been said about using those organs at the same time or multiple times - ek baar prayog karne kaa naam tantra he or anek baar ke karne kaa naam "aavriti" athwa "awaap" he
 Somewhere the organs are ritualized by mechanism and elsewhere by frequency
 isliye tantra or awaap kaa vichaar bhi aavashyak he
 For a particular fruit, do the ritual of the head organ and also perform its organs
 un angon ko bhi anya angon kii apeksha hone par jiske prayog kii aavashyaktaa hoti he use prasangi kehete hai
 It consists of the head mechanism, which is called context
 udaahranarth agnishtomic pashu purodashadi purvokt vishyon kaa purnagyata vyakti hi sangopang dharmanushthan kar saktaa he, jisaki vivechna "mimasaa darshan" main jaimini ne kii he
 The philosophy of this philosophy depicts the Dharmapramanas and depicts method, economism mantra, memory, etiquette, nomadism, conclusive sentences and strength
 dwitiyadhyaay main shabdaantar, abhyaas, sankhya, sangya, gun or prakarnaantar, ye chah karm bhed ke pramaan hai
 Shruti, gender, sentence, episode, place and Samakhya are the six evaluative evidences in Tritiyadhyaya
 chaturthadhyay main, shruti arth, paath, sthaan, mukhya or pravriti main chah bodhak pramaan hai There are seven types of excesses in Panchmadhyaya, directive, directive, nominal order, hypothetical order, dependency order and place-of-order
 ant ke do bhed saptavadhyay main varnit nahin hai
 These are denoted in the sense of authority and placements mandate
 navam adhyay main mantroh, samoh or sanskaroh ke bhed se teen prakaar ke "ooh" kaa nirupan he
 In Dasamadhyaya, there are three types of obstruction representations of distinction between earthlope, pratyamnaya and prohibition
 ekadshadhyay main tantra or aavaay kaa nirupan he
 Dwadasadhyaya has a representation of "context"
 is prakaar ek ek vishay kaa pratipaadan dwadashadhyaayaatmak mimasaa darshan main kiya gaya he jise "dwadashalakshani" bhi kaha gaya he
 Here the word symptom is a textbook isko do prakaar se vibhakt kiya gaya he jise upadesh or atidesh kehete hai
 Preaching is discussed in the first chapters
 dwitiya ke chah adhyyon main atidesh kaa vivechan he
 The above preaching is the overarching doctrine
 shaastra deepikacar parthasarathi mishra ke anusaar upadesh vichaar ke ananthar atidesh vichaar kaa aarambh hota he
 There are two chapters in present-day epistemology philosophy
 prayek adhyay main chaar paad hote hai, kintu tritiy, shashth or dasham adhyyon main aath aath paad hai, jise "shabra" adhyay bhi kehete hai
 In this way there are sixty feet in the whole book
 is darshan kii sutarasankhya main vivaad he
 In someone's opinion, two thousand six hundred fifty two, in another opinion two thousand seven hundred forty two sutras
 uparyukt varnan "aesekit" kii "karmmimasaa" naamak pustak prishth chaar main pratipaadit he
 "nyayamala", published from Anand Ashram Poona, has two thousand and forty five sutras
 isi prakaar kuch vyaktiyon ke mat se adhikaran sankhya nau sau saat praapt hoti he
 Some have nine hundred and fifteen sutras
 kintu "mimasasar sangrah" ke karta shankar bhatta ke anusaar "purvashatk" main paanch sau tees, uttardatk main chaar sau sattar sutara hai
 Thus the entire tribunal is divided into a thousand numbers
 uparyukt shloke ke anusaar adhikranon kii sankhya ek sahasr do sau pachaas he
 a tribunal is formed from many sutras, which consists of a principal sutra and other virtue sutras
 pradhan sutara purv paksh kaa pratipaadan karata he or anya sutara siddhant kaa pratipaadan karte hai
 Somewhere the northeast side has been rendered by two sources
 aise hi kahin kahin par bina sutara ke hi purv paksh kaa utthapan karke sutara se siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 Somewhere, in principle, the ex-party tax doctrine has been rendered by the undertaking
 ek paad main katipay adhikaran hote hai
 For example, there are eight tribunals in the first foot
 adhikaran main chha: padaarth hote hai - vishay, sanshay, purvapaksh, siddhant prayojan or sangati
 Consistency is of three types - scriptural consistency, chapter consistency, and foot consistency
 pratham sutara - pratham adhikaran kaa naam jigyaasa adhikaran he
 Thought is the subject of science
 vichaar shaastra aarambh karne yogya he yaa nahin, yah sanshay he
 Not initiable, this is the former side
 siddhant he ki vichaar shaastra aarambh karnaa chahie
 The origin of this subject is the study method in the opinion of Kumaril Bhatt and the teaching method in the "prabhakar" view
 purvapaksh main adhyayan kaa adrishy prayojan he or siddhant paksh main arth-gyaan-rup drusht prayojan he
 Since the religion of religion is related to philosophy, its interpretation in this school of thought is relevant
 is adhikaran main adhyayan drushtaarth hota he, yahi siddh kiya gaya he
 Therefore, the basic method of thinking is the study method
 arthgyan kaa saadhan adhyayan vidhi se akshipt hota he
 That is why the beginning of the scripture is valid
 dwitiya sutara - dwitiya adhikaran main dharm kaa lakshan or pramaan he, jisaki kartavyata vidhivaakya se prathit hoti he
 He is a means of credit
 yahan shrey shabd se aihik or aamushmik donon arth abhipret hai
 Gumak is a legal proof in the religion
 jo nishedh dwaara pratipaadit hota he vah anarth kaa saadhan hota he, use hi adharm kehete hai
 Third Sutra - The third sentence is the proof of the law sentence
 yahan pratigya maatr kii gai he
 They are said to be of two types - "chodnaiv Symptom Yasya, Chodana Symptom Me Yasya" ie here the direct evidence is not proof from religion, but legalism is considered as proof in religion
 chaturth sutara - is sutara main pratham pratigya ke samarthan ke liye chaturth adhikaran he
 Characterization of the Lok Siddha direct evidence in this tribunal - "indriarthasanikarsjanyajanam gyanam pratham"
 arthath pratyaksh vartmaan sannikrusht ko hi grahan karata he or dharm utpadyman he, atev pratyaksh dharm main pramaan nahin ho saktaa, kyonki dharm bhavishyat kaalik he
 From these words, the philosopher has not even considered the evidential inference heat and economics
 pancham sutara - chaturth sutara main chaturth adhikaran kii pratham jigyaasa kaa samarthan karke pancham sutara ke pancham adhikaran main dwitiya pratigya kaa samarthan kiya gaya he
 Law is the only proof in this tribunal, this pledge has been supported
 isi prasang main pramaanon kaa pramanya swat: utpann or swat: gruhit hota he
 That is, the knowledgeable material generates authenticity, and from the same material also becomes authentic
 vaakya do prakaar ke hote hai - loukik or vaidic
 Because of the proverbial sentence being masculine, malevolent delusions are accompanied by faults, pramad, vipralambha, karanapatava etc
, therefore, the sentence is not proof
 mantra brahmanatmak shabdarashi veda apaurushey he
 Therefore, due to not being illusory due to imperfection in legalism, legalism is the only proof in religion
 is dwitiya pratigya kaa samarthan karne ke liye pramaan kaa lakshan or shabdaarth kaa sambandh nity he
 Badarayana has also not accepted transcendence in Pramanya
 padaarth-pratipaadan main sanket dwaara shabd se padaarthon kaa, vaakyarth-pratipaadan main granth kaa or rachana dwaara purush kaa tridha sambandh hota he
 The entry of the man into the Veda has been denied by assuming the words and the meaning of the word-reader-relationship regularly
 arthath, veda purush ke dwaara pranit hai -aisa kehane kaa kaaran yah he ki hamanen vaakyon ko bina vyakti ke kabhi nahin suna, padhaa yaa janaa he
 Whereas, in the opinion of the Mimansakas, the relation of the word and the word Ghatpatadi-meaning is constant
 atah 'ye pad is arth ko bataata he'- is baat kaa hamen pataa na hone par bhi pad apane pratipaadya ko bataata hi he
 That is, even if there is no Shakti Graha, there is only the ability of rendering in the verse
 or vaakyarth sambandh ke dwaara purush sambandh ko pruthak karne ke liye vaakyadhikaran kii pravriti he
 In this tribunal, as the substance of the verse has power, the sentence has power in the sentence, such is not required for those who render, because the substance present in the verse is discovered by aspiration, merit and attachment
 Renders vaiyaakaran mat se vaakyarth vaakyashakti se bhaasith hota he
 According to this opinion, the relationship between substances in word sense is related to the common sense
 yah naiyayikon kaa mat he, jisase vaakya kii vaakyarth main pruthak shakti kii pratiti hoti he, kintu kumaril bhatta ne abhihitanvay kaa samarthan kiya he
 Prabhakar has supported Anavitabhidhan
 is tarah vaakyarth main purush sandendh dwitiya prakaar se nirast hua
 The third type is through scripture
 sandarbh vaakya kaa purush ke saath do prakaar se sambandh hota he, ek kartri-karm-bhav-sambandh dwaara or dwitiya prayukt-pravachan-bhav-sambandh dwaara hota he
 The discourse is common and the composition is extraordinary
 asaadhaaran visheshan hota he
 Therefore Veda is Pourusheya
 kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar vedon main purush, desh, nadi, vriksh aadi ke nirdesh hone ke kaaran vedon ko purushpranit athwa paurushey kehete hai, kintu mimasaa darshan ke anusaar pravachan bhi asaadhaaran mana gaya he
 For example, the legend about "katasamhita" or "kat brahmana" is the legend that "sorrow" was studied completely by Maharishi among many branch chapters
 dwitiya hetu he ki veda main purush, nadi aadi kaa naam aata he, isse bhi veda paurushey siddh hota he, kintu yah kalpana chatur-buddhi-vihit nahin; kyonki praaia: sarvapratham sansaarik vastuon ke naam veda se hi aae hai, usee drushti se lok -naam kii parampara chali he
 That is, the Vedas do not consider history to be impermanent, but it represents the continuity of history, its detailed interpretation is visible in the "shabarbhyas" of the epistle
 nity vishay or vaakya athwa vachan ko yathanupurvi brahmarshigan samadhi main darshan karte hai, atev veda main purvapurush kartrutvkalpana kaa lesh bhi samavesh nahin he
 "cosmic creations are masculine due to their male special curiosity, such as Mahabharata, Ramayana etc
 kumaril bhatta ke anusaar adhyayan parampara anadi he
 Therefore, Vedas are also extraordinary
 aise hi adhikaran siddhant nyaay se hi veda granth rachana ke dwaara purush sambandh nahin ho saktaa, atev vidhi vaakya hi dharm main pramaan he
 There is no fundamental formula in the philosophy of epistemology
 yadhyapi uttarmimasaa ke '"ek evatman: sharire bhavat" is sutara ke bhashya main shankaracharya ne likhaa he ki "purv-tantra" main atmpratipadak sutara nahin he, is vachan ko kahkar aatm swaroop kaa vivechan kiya he
 Quoting the Vrittikārā मतa doctrine authentically, it is written: "atmabhidhanprasaktau yathatmastitvam and sharike vakshyam:"
 abhipraay yah hua ki purvamimasaa bhi uttarmimasaa kii tarah advay aatma ko maanakar hi nirmit hue hai, tathaapi purvamimasaa sharir ke atirikt kartta-bhokta aatmatatv ko maanakar hi prachlit hua he, kyonki karm-siddhant ke antargat "kritahani" or "akrutabhyagam" nihit he
 And from here there is the accomplishment of rebirth etc
 "chodana punararambh:" "satsamprayoge purushasyendryanam" in donon sutron se aatmbeej kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 And Vapan etc
 is the sacrament of pod
 purusharth main purush shabd se asthi yajna or krit yag se aatma ko fal prapti hoti he
 Shabar Swami, without specifying the sutra, considered the "yagyayudh Sentence" as an instrument, refuting the opinion of the non-believer, and proved the form of self through logic and srutis, which also proved the Vedas authenticity
 uttar-mimasaa main aatma ko ek hi mana gaya he; kintu "sankhya yoga", nyaay, vaisheshik or purvamimasaa main aatma ko anek mana gaya he, jiskaa karm ke dwaara sharir, indriya or man se sambandh hota he
 Therefore, body, sense and subject are called bandhas
 ukt tray aatma ko bandhan main daalate hai, jisase aatma sukhdu:khadi dwandv ko bhogata he
 While doing routine katattavya buddhi to routine moral deeds, the creature keeps on consuming the destiny deeds
 sharir indriya se atirikt jo brahm buddhi se aatma kii upasna karata he uskaa sharir indriya aadi se sambandh kaa koi kaaran nahin he, aisa vyakti vartmaan sharir ke naash ke pashchaat swa swaroop main sthit ho jaataa he
 According to Uttarmimamsa, body, senses and subject have been called bonds which are the cause of ignorance; His retirement is salvation
 udaahranarth - "nivritiratma Mohsya Known purvamimasaa bhi yahi sweekaar karata he ki sharir, indriya or vishyon kaa sambandh hi bandhan hai, tathaa uskaa vilay hi moksh he, jiskaa saadhan, gyaan or karm samucchy he
 There are two types of enlightenment
 shariratirikt atmagyaan ritu kaa ang hota he, jo ni:shreyaskaarak he
 Vedic and temporal sentences have been interpreted by a number of thousands of sentences for judicial usable judgments
 atev bhartiya darshanon main pratham sthaan karm pratipadak purvamimasaa darshan kaa hi he
 Uttarmimamsa considers creation from ignorance and destruction of creation from enlightenment
 nyaay, vaisheshik darshan ne dvanukadi kram se mahabhoot paryant mahasrishti or mahabhoot se parmaanu paryant vinaash ko mahapralay kaha he
 That is, the entire gesture functions are generated in a double order and are destroyed from macro to nuclear
 panch mahabhuton main prithvi, jal, tej or vaayu ke parmaanu nity hai
 The sky itself is continual, but according to the earlier epistemology, there are two types of creation and three types of holocaust, in which the word Mahasrishti and Khand Srishti are called two creation
 aise hi pralay, mahapralay or khand pralay shabd se teen pralay kahe gaye hai
 Among them, Khandi Srishti and Khanda Pralaya have been considered similar to nowadays
 udaahranarth kisi sthal vishesh kaa bukamp aadi se vinaash ho jaataa he or kahin par naveen vastu kii sristi ho jaati he
 In Mahasrishti, the creation of atoms in the Panchamabhuta by the atom from the atoms in the Mahasrishti, which is mentioned in the tenth mandala of the Rigveda - matsaypuranadi main bhi khand pralay ke antargat vidyaman padaarthon kii sthiti kaa vivaran praapt hota he, kintu purv mimasaa mahasrishti or mahapralay ko sweekaar nahin karata
 According to him, no evidence is available in the destruction of all substances
 jaisaa ki vaarthikkaar ne kaha he - Mimamsa philosophy considers block creation and block holocaust
 bhartiya chha: aastik darshanon main nyaay, vaisheshik or vedant kii ishwar sadhak yuktiyaan praaia: samaan hi hai
 For example "yato va Imani Bhoothani Jayante", "dyavabhumi Janayan Dev Ek:" "vishvasya Kattra Bhuvanasya Gopta" through these Srutis and "janmadasya Yatra": This Vedanta Sutra proves God
 isi prakaar nyaay shaastra ke "kshityankuradik kartrujanrya kaaryatvat ghatavat" anumaan se bhi ishwar kii siddhi kii gai he, kintu vedantiyon ne shrutiyon se ishwar ko siddh kar anumaan pramaan ko unka sahakaari kaaran mana he
 And Naiyayikas have supposedly proved God to be the cooperative cause of Shrutis
 sankhya darshan main do mat hai - seshwar or nirishwar
 The Sesvara Samkhists believe in God, but treat him with a special word
 nirishwar sankhyavaadee ishwar kaa nishedh karte hai, "kintu vigyaan bhikshu ne "ishwarasiddhe:" is sutara main "pramanabhavat" is pad kaa ullekh kar ishwar ko sweekaar kiya he
 Mimamsa philosophy does not prohibit the support of God in the same manner as the Naiyayikas, and like the Nirishvara Samyakists, but in the "sambandesh Parihar" treatise, Kumaril Bhatt has resolved the meaning of God in relation to the word
 abhipraay yah he ki sambandh kaa karta ishwar nahin he
 By accepting the above words, it is popular that Mimamsak is an atheist
 kumaril bhatta, nandishwar aadi mimasakon ne anumaansiddh ishwar kaa niraakaran kiya he or vedasiddh ishwar ko sweekaar kiya he
 In fact, Mimamsa accepts Siddha Brahma or God from the Veda
 kyaaki mimasaa darshan veda kaa swatah pramaan maanata he
 Mimamsa is also known as Purvimamsa and Vedantaka Uttermimansa
 isse bhi veydant kaa mimasaa ke sidbhant ar mimasaa kaa veydant ke siddhanth maanya hai yah baat spasht haati he
 Vedhita Yagadi Karma Dravya and Deity are compatible with these two
 dravya dadhyadi he or devtaa shastrake samadhigamya he
 That is, the sentence which the deity says is considered the deity
 yahan devtaa ke vishay main teen paksh dashamadhyay ke chaturthpad main or shabar bhashya aadi granthon main bhi sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The meaning deity is the specific deity and the word deity
 in teenon main antim paksh hi siddhant he, kyonki arth kaa samaran shabd ke dwaara hua karata he
 Therefore, because of the first appearance of the word, the word itself has been considered a deity
 udaahranarth "indraay swaha, takshakaay swaha" shabdon main indraay or takshakaay ye chaturthaant pad hi devtaa hai
 Even those who accept the meaning of the deity cannot ignore the word
 at: teenon pakshon main shabd mukhya hone ke kaaran mimasakon ne shabd ko hi devtaa sweekaar kiya he
 There is a rule here - the deity word which is in the method sentence should be pronounced in evacuation, renunciation and hymn, etc
, not its synonyms
 udaahranarth "aagneyamshtakapalam" main agni ke paryaayavachi "jatvedas" shabd kaa prayog nahin karnaa chahie
 It is known from the above things that the "word goddess" is the principle of Mimamsa philosophy
 devtaa ke vigrahadi sadasad bhav kaa vichaar - agni aadi devtaa ke vigrahadi paanch is darshan main maane jate hai
 That is, Vigraha, Havish, Bhoga, Aishwarya, happiness and fruitfulness are these five Vigrasha
 ukt vachan ke aadhaar par hi vedantiyon ne devtaa ke vigrahadi paanch swaroop maane hai
 The idea is that just like humans etc
, the taxes, steps etc
 are also of the gods, they accept Havish, eat and eat and give happiness to the Yajaman
 at: devtaa vigrahadiman hai
 The above thought is the same Yasak Maharishi has proved masculinity with the sentence "athakaar Chintanam" of "nirukta"
 mimasaa darshan ke anusaar "shabdamayi devtaa" kaa samarthan kiya gaya he, kintu shabar swami ne apane shashth devataadhikaran bhashya main devtaa vigrah kaa khandan kiya he
 Generally, all the scholars like Parthasarathi, Khandadeva etc
 have followed this path, but in his commentary, Kumaril Bhatt has considered the deity as a part of it and not the deity as the head, and has accepted karma primarily and said that karma is the fruit
 gives
 swami ke rahete hue das se koi fal kii yachana nahin karata
 Karmana Phaljakantavam and Shabdmayi Devta, the above two principles have been supported by other minders by considering the deity Vigrahadi
 bhashyakaar shabar kaa devtaa vigrah kaa niraakaran prodhiwaad se jaananaa chahie
 Therefore, Purvimamsa accepts the "word goddess"
 uskaa gyaan, taddhit, chaturthi vibhakti or mantravarna in teenon se hota he
 The only difference between them is that with the frequency of the corresponding power, the deity realizes
 chaturthi vibhakti lakshanya or mantravarna adhishthan kaa bodhan karata he
 Mimamsadarsan has considered the part of the deeds of the deity in the above manner in terms of his ritualism
 vastutah devatashastra ta nirukt he
 Nirukta is Vedang and epistemology is Vedapang
 atah vaidic devataatatvavichaar ke prasang main nirukt ke vivechan kaa swatantra ar mukhya devataatatvavichaar maananaa avashyak haata he
 The realization through sentences is called sentence comprehension or word comprehension
 vaakya bhi aakhyaant hi hota he - Subantachaya: Sentence, Tingantachayavakyam, Suptingantachayo Sentam
 usamen ye teen paksh hai, jinamein karkanvit kriya honi chahie
 According to Amarkosh - "tidd
subant chayo sentence verb va karkhavitaita"
 arthath subant or tingant vaakyon kaa karkanvit kriya paryavsaan hota he
 The three views of Kumaril Bhatt, Prabhakar and Murari are famous in the East India, but in the last, a famous text with the name "tripad Niti Nayan" has also been known
 mimasakon main abhihitanvayavaad ar anvitabhidhanwaad naam se do prasthaan prasiddh hai
 Among them, first is the opinion of Kumaril Bhatt and second Prabhakar
 shaabdh bodh main bhaavana ko mukhya rup se bhatta ne sweekaar kiya he
 Prabhakar has accepted the task as the main one
 abhihitanvay shabd kaa yah arth he ki padon se pratipaadit padaarth gyaan aakanksha, yogyata or aasakti samanvit hokar lakshana ke dwaara shaabdabodh karaate hai In the Nyayamat, there is power in the substance of the posts and the verses signify knowledge
 padon se padaarth kii upasthiti hoti he
 Similarly, it is said in Mimamsa, for example Jyotishtomen Swarga Kamo Yajet "
 yahan "yajet" main do ansh hai -"yaj" dhaatu or "t" pratyay
 The suffix represents the emotional sense of exposition
 us bhaavana kii teen aakankshaayen hoti hai - saadhyaakanksha sadhanakanksha or "itikartavyatakanksha"
 On attaining realization, there is a true discovery of heaven
 sadhanakanksha hone par dhatworth kaa kaarantven anvay hota he
 
 iti kartavyatakanksha hone par itikartavyatatven anvay hota he
 The sentence states that vishisht arth kaa bodh karne ke liye vaakya lok main prayukt hota he
 Padraavana leads to separate knowledge of substances
 yah vaacharth he, kintu jo padaarthagyan hota he vah shrota ko abhipret nahin or jiske liye vaakya prayukt hua usase shrota kaa kaary nahin hota, aise sthal main vaakya taatpary kii anutpatti hoti he
 Consequently, symptoms have been considered for prevention of deficiency
 sabhi darshanikon ne taatparyanupapatti ko lakshana kaa beej sweekaar kiya he
 Two types of meanings are considered, first meaning and second meaning
 pratham avaantar taatpary padaarth vishay kaa pratipaadan karata he or mahataatpary vaakyarth vishay kaa pratipaadan karata he
 In aphorism, there is a sense of sentence by sentence
 kumaril bhatta ne nimna shlokon se pratipaadan kiya he - By this word, the form of Bhatt Padaka Orientalism is shown
 kuch vidwaanon kaa kathan he ki "ananvitavasth" padaarth padon se abhihit hote hai
 Their discovery is only targeted
 atev "anvitabhidhanwaad" kumaril bhatta kaa he, kintu bhatta mat kaa anuvadak anvitabhidhanwaad maanakar jo khandan karte hai, yah uchit nahin he, kyonki unke granthon main uparyukt lekh kii charchaa kahin bhi nahin he
 This is what the word Anavitabhidhan means - the verses are called Anvirtha Bodhan
 atev pad shakti se hi padaarth or vaakyarth donon kaa bodh ho jaataa he
 There is no need to assume additional signs etc
 from the position of power
 vayovruddh purush kisi vastu ko laane le jane ke liye shabd kaa prayog karata he
 The child next to him understands the meaning of the word by hearing the word and seeing the other man carrying and carrying it
 yahi pravriti kaa kaaryatagyaan kaaran he
 In folk, action is also considered as action, similarly in Vedas, Yagadi action is considered as primary work
 yagadi kriya kshanik he or swarg kalantar bhavi he
 Therefore, the said Veda is considered as an object called "apurva," apart from the sentence discussion
 yahan par "ek kaary shabd" kii purvokt do shaktiyaan do arthon main sweekaar kerani padati hai
 One has to accept strength and the other is to be characterized
 usamen bhi alokik kaary main vishesh shakti he, jaisaa vidwaanon main prachlit he - In folk, there is a symptom in action form
 veda main pad hi vaakya hote hai or padaarth hi vaakyarth hota he 
 In this opinion, synonyms, anvay and sangaras are all synonymous
 arthath anvit hi anvay main nimitt hota he
 Prabhakar has considered customer eclipse, that proves investigative
 is mat main - "yajet swargkaam:" is vaakya se anvitabhidhan kaa shaabd bodh hota he
 In this darshan, there is only the provision of Yag for heaven
 swarg se abhipraay yah he - jo du:kha se grast na ho tathaa du:kha utpann kii usamen sambhaavna na ho or abhilaashaa ko purna kare use swarg kehete hai
 By means of sentences like "dashapurnamasabhyam swargakamo yajet" etc
, the instrument of heaven has been constituted by Darshanamasam Yag
 yag ko kshanik mana gaya he, kyonki kisi devtaa ke uddeshy se dravya ke tyaag kaa naam yag he
 "indray Idan Na Mama" renounces the psyche business with this sentence
 us kshan main us vyapaar kaa naash ho jaataa he
 The subject of imperfect love is called heaven
 vah kalantar athwa janmaantar main praapt hota he
 This is the rule of philosophy, reason must remain in the disorganized prior moment of Kayapatti, and transient yag birth is not possible in the haphazard predecessor of future self-consciousness
 etdarth ukt shruti ke aadhaar se yag kaa saadhy, swarg kaa saadhan athwa yag kii uttaravastha evam fal kii purvavastha, ye sab ek vastu siddh hoti hai, jise atishay, apurv, yaa yogyata kehete hai
 It has been elaborately analyzed by Kumaril Bhatt in Unreasonable Action
 yaganushthan ke purv purush main swarg ke upbhog karne kii yogyata nahin hoti
 Even before the rituals, there is no ability to give Swargadi fruit and by resolving the inefficiency of the man and the inefficiency of karma, the scriptural ability is now considered to be incomparable
 yatha This is called as pre-emptive or preplanned
 jahaan ek hi pradhan ho vahaan pradhan yag se jo apurv utpann hota use utpatypurv kehete hai
 The phenomena that arise from the organs are called Angaapurava
 angaporesv or pradhanapurv donon milakar parmapurv ko utpann karte hai
 From it, you get the fruit of Swargadi
 kuch yaagon main anek pradhanon se fal hota he
 For example - Darsha has three Yagas and Pournamas also has three Yagas
 yahan teenon pradhanon se utpann honevaale teen utpatypurvo se ek samudaya purv utpann hota he
 a pre-eminent arises from both communities
 abhipraay yah hua ki uparyukt pratham udhaaharan main teen apurv maane jate hai
 In the second example, preterm, premenstrual, preclinical and preclinical, four are considered incomplete
 ye hi mimasakon kaa sarvasv he
 In it Bhatt Mimansak Shabar Bhasya 2
 1
 2 according to "yagen Apurva Kritva Swarga Bhavayet", accomplishes Apoorva with words and with eloquence
 or use lingadi kaa vachya tathaa shabdabodh main mukhya visheshya maanate hai
 Apoorva has been refuted by all philosophers, it is a refutation of speech and precept
 darshan shastron main padaarthvivechna ke liye chaar kotiyaan maani gai hai - Proof theorem theorem
 pramaan - pramaan use kehete hai jisase vishay kaa nishchayatmak gyaan ho or vishay kaa nirdhaaran ho
 Theorem - One who has knowledge through proof is called a theorem
 pramiti - pramaan ke dwaara jis kisi bhi vishay kaa nishchayatmak gyaan ho, use pramiti kehete hai
 Pramata - One who knows theorem knowledge through proof - is called Pramata
 yahan vibhinn bhartiya darshanikon ne gyaan ke vishay main dwividh vichaar kiya he - The authenticity of knowledge is automatically admissible or layer: admissible
 swat: koti main mimasak, vedanti or buddha aate hai
 Layer: Justice, Vaiseshika, Yoga, Jain and Charvak are included in the category
 yahan pramanya shabd se arthtathatv lakshan pramanya samajhnaa chahie, na ki agyatarth gyaapakatv lakshan pramanya
 Chodanalakshanodharm: In the sutra - "naanu Athatabhumapayartha Bruyat Chodana", etc
, the meaning of the subject is explained
 "tachch abadhitatvan, arthnirutho dharm vishesh:, tasya gyanen niruprana"
 Chaudna Sutra's commentary "athaattva Bhootam Artha" refers to the non-objective meaningless religion, which is represented by knowledge
 atev pramanya ko gyananishtha kaha jaataa he
 That layer is generated and layer is admitted
 yah naiyayikon kaa siddhant he
 That is, the material from which knowledge is generated, does not originate from other material, and from which knowledge is acquired, from which knowledge is acquired rather than from other qualities, knowledge is acquired from knowledge
 isse yah aayaa ki gyanotpadak saamagree se bhinn saamagree se pramanya utpann hota he or gyaan graahak saamagree se bhinn saamagree ke dwaara pramanya gruhit hota he
 In this opinion, there is both the primordial and the imperfect layer
 yah naiyayik sammat vivechna he
 In the above opinion, Mimansak people tell infidel dosha, due to which knowledge can never be proved valid
 arthath lokvyavahaar vicchhinn ho jayega
 Therefore, knowledge is self-generated and automatically acquired
 abhipraay yah he ki jis samagri se gyaan utpann hota he, usee saamagree se pramanya bhi utpann hota he; or jis saamagree se gyaan gruhit hota he usee saamagree se pramanya bhi gruhit hota he
 This is the self-authenticity of the Authentic Mimanskadikas, which Kumaril Bhatt has endorsed in his treatise Bhatta Vartika with many tips - yahan bhattamat main gyaan anumey he
 Something excessive arises in the subject of knowledge, from which it is known
 isse gyatata naamak ek dharm ghatadi vishay main utpann hota he, jise practyam, bhasana, prakaash: aadi shabdon se kaha jaataa he
 From this it came to be known that knowledge is derived from the presumption of gender
 isi se pramanya kaa bhi grahan hota he
 Knowledge itself is light in Prabhakarism
 at: gyaan se hi gyananishtha pramanya kaa bhi grahan hota he
 Therefore, the automatic belief is the same in both opinions, which are discussed in detail in "shloka Vartika", "case Panjika", "nyaya Ratnamala"
 pratyaksh anumaanadi se anavgat arth ke bodhak vaakya ko vidhi kehete hai
 That is, the name of the sentence which is unknowable, objectionable promoter
 vidhyarth ke sambandh main mimasakon ke do paksh hai - ek pravartana ko vidhyarth maanata he
 Almost all the parents come here
 doosraa kaary ko vidhyarth maanata he
 This is Prabhakar's theory
 is paksh main is prakaar kaa utpaadan hota he - Promoters in folk, Acharya or Raja use the sentence "gamanay" etc
 to instill their disciples or acts
 shishy yaa bhrity ukt vaakya ko sunakar uske arth kaa anusandhan karata he
 After this, "gavanayan" comes into the act
 isliye pravartak purush kaa jo abhipraay vishesh he, use lok main vidhyarth kehete hai
 It is the action of man who lives in man
 atev ise purushabhipraay bhi kehete hai
 The Vedic Lingadis cannot be called Purushabhipraya because Vedas are apaurusheya
 at: purush ke sthaan par lingadi shabd kaa prayog hota he
 His business specialty is the same
 shabdanishth hone ke kaaran ise shabdi bhaavana bhi kehete hai
 It has been characterized as "purushaapravakanutika: Promoter Lingadinishtho trade especially: Shabdi Bhavna"
 shaastra main ise hi pravartana, prerana aadi kaha gaya hai
 There are two types of instincts in the world - first, the male instincts by his will
 dwitiya pravartak purush, athwa shabd ke dwaara vyakti pravrutt hota he, jise "prerana janya" kehete hai
 Where there is a tendency after inspiration, enlightenment is considered to be the promoter, which Mandan Mishra, Parthasarathi Prabhriti scholars have considered as "favors"
 nyaay sudhakar ne ise alokik dharm vishesh mana he
 Prabhakar Mishra has considered working knowledge towards the tendency, which leads to obsolescence etc
 at: "chodana lakshano dharm:" sutara main likhaa he - "acharya chodith" karomi" is bhashya kii vyakhya karte hue shalikanath ne kaha he - chodith: pravartit:, kaaryamvabodhit: ityarth:, kaaryatagyaan vina pravriterasambhavaditi" atev prabhakar mat main kaha gaya he - "kaary vidhyarth:, tachch kaary dhatvarthatiriktam, apurv shabd vachyam tadev vidhyarth iti" Four types of methods have been presented in the philosophy of Mimamsa, which is for the decision of the Vedas
 uttpattividhi : jis vaakya se karm swaroop kii katrtavyata prathmat: vidit hoti ho use utpattividhi kehete hai
 For example, "agnihotra Juhoti" means to get favored from a house called Agnihotra
 viniogvidhi : angapradhan kaa sambandh jis vidhivaakya se gyaat hota he, use viniogvidhi kehete hai
 For example, "dadhna Juhoti" explains the meaning of havana with curd
 isamen dadhi saadhan he or home saadhy he
 Here the relation of the word appropriation should be understood in the appropriation method
 vah sambandh saadhy-saadhan-bhav, angangi bhav athwa sheshsheshi bhav main samaapt hota he
 Experimental method: One who makes sense of order in the ritual of head and organ is called experiment
 udaahranarth prayajadi ang se upakrit pradhan darshapurnmaas yag se swarg kii prapti hoti he
 It is with this intent that the symptom is described as "anganam serial method; Methodology:" adhikaravidhi : jis vidhi se karmjanya fal kaa bhokta karta ko mana jaataa ho use adhikaravidhi kehete hai
 For example, "yajet Swarga Kama:" The one who is the priest here is the one who is the bearer of heaven
 isi prakaar se apurv vidhi, niyam vidhi or parisankhya vidhi ke bhed se teen prakaar kii vidhiyaan prasiddh hai - There are two types of methods mentioned above, it should be understood in this way that the origin, appropriation experiment and authority law are all around in the invention
 niyam tathaa parisankhya vidhi, viniyog vidhi main hi antargat he
 Special knowledge of this subject is visible in Bhatt Chintamani
 jhunku sagar jile kii devari tehsil kaa ek ward he jo kii devari ke sabhi vardo main sabase bada ward he is ward main krishi upaj mandi sthit he or yaheen se mashhoor or pracheen nadi ramghat nadi nikalati he jo aage jaakar sukhchen nadi se milti he

 ravi baswani hindi filmon ke ek abhinayta the
 Ravi Vaswani is a film actor
 unhone hindi filmon me kaaphi yogadan diya he
 His work was well appreciated in Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron
 paraayaa naatak ko kuch paatro ke madhyam se samajhane kaa praytn kiya gaya he In which the main character Ravi who is only 13 years old
 or ek dadaji he said role main do mahilaye ,ek baccha or anya paatr rakhe gaye jo keval puraa naatak ko samajhane ke liye rahe gaye he 
 The beginning of a strange drama us samay hoti he jab naatak kaa pramukh paatr ravi ghar se saiyr par niklaa to raste main usne do mahilao ko baat karte dekha or suna , Savita Boli - anitha boli – what ? savita boli – He who was Mahendra's boy left home as soon as he became an officer
 anitha boli – What time has come when it is not our own, it was a stranger savita boli – Anita is right phir ye bate sunakar ravi aage kii ore badha to usne do ladakiyon ko ladate dekha jo kah rahi thi 


 a girl speaks - i tuhar kapadaa ha t i hamaar kapadaa ha The second girl speaks - kii i hamaar kapada ha 
 And both of them fought amongst themselves, sometimes one girl would scream at the other girl and sometimes at the other as if it would kill each other
 ye hamaar or tuhar dekhakar ravi kaaphi udhaas ho gaya or phir wo aage kii saiyr par nikal padaa apane safar kii aage kii kadi main wo apane ek sage ke ghar pahunchaa jaise hi wo panhucha uske paas ek baccha aayaa or bolaa – kya karne aaye ho ? ravi bolaa - aise hi ghoomte chale aayaa 
 Then he went ahead in a sequence of walks in a marriage where he saw and heard some incidents after which he decided that he would know what this alien is, this word was unknown to him, he could not understand that What to do? After attending the wedding, he was returning to the house, on the way, his eyes were fixed on a grandfather sitting near a tree, Ravi was thankful that his questions must be answered with his grandfather
 Ga Sun has not the slightest delay immediately was led to the grandfather
 sammaan janak shabdon kaa prayog karte hue ravi bolaa - dada ji mere jehen main ek vichaar aayaa he kya aap mujhe samajha sakate he kii iskaa matlab kya hota he ? dadaji ne tanik bhi sankoch nahi kiya Grandpa immediately said - haa betaa bolo ! Ravi said - ye paraayaa kya hota he? Grandpa started to look at me carefully as if he was trying to tell us that how and why this thing came in the mind of such a small child dadaji bole - Who said this to you son?

 These graphs are graphical signs that express an idea or concept
 kuch bhavchitra aise hote hai ki vah kisi chiz ko aise darshaate hai ki us bhavchitra se aparichit vyakti bhi uskaa arth pahchaan saktaa he, masalan 'chaate' ke liye unicode main ☂ kaa chihn jise aisa koi bhi vyakti pahchaan saktaa he jisane chaataa dekha ho
 Conversely, some expressions can only be identified by those familiar with them, for example the sign of 'ॐ' expresses the concept of 'god' or 'religion' and the sign of '6' conveys the concept of number six
 chini bhashaa kii lipi or pracheen misr kii lipi aisi chitralipiyon ke udhaaharan hai
 "images" are called "idiogram" or "idiograph" in English
 "chitralipi" ko angrezi main "idiographic script" yaa "pictographic script" kaha jaataa he
 In the script which is based on the alphabet, the reader only has to learn the symbols for certain sounds
 uske baad in chihnon ko jodakar pathak us bhashaa ke sabhi shabd pard saktaa he
 If there is a new or unfamiliar word, the reader can pronounce it by reading its letters
 bhavchitron par aadhaarit chitralipiyon main pathakon ko kabhi-kabhi sainkadon yaa hazaron chihn seekhney padhate hai
 It is necessary for learning Chinese language
 phir bhi chitralipiyon kaa ek bada laabh he
 Both Nepali and Hindi use Devanagari script based on alphabet
 yadi koi hindibhashi nepali bhashaa kaa 'atuva' shabd dekhe to vah use uccharit to kar saktaa he lekin yah nahin samaj saktaa kii uskaa arth 'adarak' he
 In contrast, Chinese and Japanese speakers get the meaning of 'cat' by seeing the 猫 sign used in Chinese and the language, but speak it in different ways in their respective languages
 japani main ise 'neko' padhaa jaataa he or mandarin chini main ise 'maao' padhaa jaataa he
 Many people of Japan are able to derive a lot of meaning from it by reading Chinese newspaper without knowing a single word of Chinese
 vahi akhbaar agar unhen chini main pard ke sunaaya jaae to unhen kuch bhi samaj na aaye
 It is the same thing as seeing the sign of हिन्दी, the Hindi-speaking will say 'chhatri', the English-speaking will say 'umbrella' and the French-speaking 'paraplui'
 isi vajah se chinibhashi log aksar china main paae gaye hazaron saal puraane shilaalekh dekhakar unako kuch had tak samajhane main sakasham hote hai kyonki bahut se bhavchitra lambe arase se thode-thode pher-badal ke saath chale aa rahe hai
 Although expressions are used in Chinese script, many words are written by adding sounds related to these images
 aksar shabdon main ek bhavchitra arth kaa kuch andaaza detaa he or doosraa dhwani banane main sahaayak hota he
 Therefore the Chinese script is actually a mixed form of hieroglyph and sound-based script
 udhaaharan ke liye chini main 沖 ko 'chong' uccharit kiya jaataa he or iskaa arth he 'pani kaa tej bahaav yaa lahar'
 There are three small ridges on its left which means "water"
 yah pani se sambandhit anya shabdon main bhi pai jaati hai, jaise ki 河, 河 or 流 
 To the left of Chong, it is a drawing of water but to its right is a sign of जिसका which means 'beech' and is pronounced 'jong'
 jab in donon bhavchitron ko milakar 沖 likhaa jaataa he to pathak ko yah sanket he ki arth ke liye baayein taraf kaa chinh dekho or dhwani ke liye daayen taraf dekho
 So the reader understands that it is a word related to water which will be pronounced similar to 'jong'
 is se vah bhaanp jaataa he ki yah shabd 'chong' he
 Note that the meaning of the word Jong on the right side is not used at all and the sound related to the water on the left side is not used at all

 phujita paimaana yaa phujita-pimmersan scale bavandaron ke shakti maapan kaa ek reating paimaana he
 Its basis is the investigation of damage to man-made structures and vegetation
 phujita paimaane kii aadhikarik shrenee kaa akalan mausamvid va ejeeniyar kai tathyon ke adhyayan ke baad karte hai jaise ki jamini va hawaii surveykshan tathaa paristhitiyon ke anusaar dharti par pade bavandar ke ghumaav vrutt, radar dwaara praapt jaankaree pratyakshdarshiyon ke saakshaatkaar media kii khabaren va kshati kii sthir va video tasviren aadi
 This scale was invented in 1971 by Tetsuya Fujita, a scientist at the University of Chicago
 is kaary main unke sahyogi the neshnal sever storems forcast centre ke adhyaksh alan pimmersan 1973 main is avishkaar main tufaan maarg kii lambaai va chaudaai jaanane ke bhi gun jod liye gaye
 All tornadoes in the US after 1973 are immediately rated on this scale
 saath hi neshnal oshanik and etmospherick administration neshnal tornado databes ke liye 1950 se 1972 ke bich aaye bavandaron kii ghatana-uparaant reating bhi isi paimaane se kii gai
 Fujita rated all of the tornadoes from 1916–1992, and Tom Grazulis worked on rating all the tornadoes in grades F2 – F5, going back to 1980
 phujita scale 2007 tak britain ke alaava har jagah istemaal hota he
 In 2007, it was upgraded to unveil the new Enhanced Fujita scale
 haalanki kshati kaa mukhya kaaran hawa kii gati hoti he, phujita scale hawa par kam dhyaan dete hue kshati maapne kaa paimaana he
 The enhanced Fujita scale was needed because the researchers found that the wind speed data on which the basis of damage testing was centered were vertically approximate
 punah anusandhan ke baad vaigyanikon ne anhansed phujita scale ke aadhaar par in nae gati aankadon ko sthapit kiya
 One drawback is that this figure is based only on US manufacturing practices
 ief paimaane ne kshati ke varnan main bhi khaasaa sudhaar kiya
 The original scale created by Fujita was to combine Beaufort and MAC scales well
 isamen F0 se F12 tak teraa str the
 F1 meant 12th level of the Beaufort scale and F12 meant MAC number one
 F0 is assigned to zero damage, just as Beaufort's zero level means the wind is stable
 The damage of each category of the Fujita scale was described by these wind speed levels, and the range of tornadoes was determined based on the damage
 saath hi diya gaya aarekh beufort, mike va phujita paimaanon ke sambandh ko samajhaata he
 When the Fujita scale was first invented, there was little information on wind speed damage, so the original scale was only an educated estimate of the damage level based on different wind speeds
 phujita ke anusaar 6 str F0 se F5 tak kaaphi the tathaa isamen sabhi gati shreniyan va kshati shreniyan sammilit kii ja sakati thim
 He, however, had also left an 'F6' level open, causing an unseemly tornado and unrelated damage to it
 saath hi pehle ke gati-kshati dwijon ke aankadon main hawa kii gati ke maanak galat paae gaye hai
 In larger categories this error becomes even greater, especially between F3 and F5
 NOAA states that " xxrep 4 
 exact figures of wind speed are not available and all are based on estimates
 bhinn gati kii hawaaen alag jagah va building par ek si kshati bhi utpann kar sakati hai
 It is inappropriate to determine a particular wind speed as the cause of damage without extensive scientific and engineer study
 " tab se utkrisht vaayu-gati aankadon vaala ief paimaana chalan main aayaa he
 Some sources have added an f + level
 iskaa arth he hawa gati 39 meter prati ghanta se kam, jahaan kuch khaas maukon par hawa kaa prabhaav lambey chaude ilaake main hota he
 The five categories based on increasing intensity are as follows: * phujita ke mul paimaane main gati ke aankade atyant trutipurna paae gaye hai
 See Enhanced Fujita scale
 note: bavandar maarg kii chaudaai phujita shrenee-ankon kaa madhya hoti he, tathaa yah ek lagbhag-sankhya hoti he
 The intensity of the tornado should not be measured by the size of the damaged area as the Fujita scale is based on the damage caused by strong winds
 ek F5 bavandar kaa kshetra aakaar ek samay keval 90 meter tha
 The tornado is the only theoretical creation
 sampatti kshati kul kshati se adhik nahin ho sakat or yahi F5 bavandar main hota he
 In theory, a wind speed of 319 mph is possible, and in Oklahoma City, 1999, such a tornado may have occurred
 parantu aaj tak ska maap nahin ho sakaa tathaa yah aankada bhi jameel ke tal par nahin praapt kiya gaya he
 The rating of the Fujita scale for the study of meteorology can be divided into classes
 1971 main shuru kiya gaya phujita scale hawa kii gati ke aankadon par aadhaarit karke kshati kaa anumaan lagaataa tha
 This was nothing more than an educated guess
 phujita va anya logon ne sheeghra hi yah samaj liya va 1970 ke dashak main is par or gahan adhyayan kiye gaye
 This showed that a lower wind speed can do more damage than what the f scale reported
 haalanki yah paimaana hawa se hui kshati kaa anumaan lagaati he, parantu isamen nirmaan kii utkrushtataa yaa adhamta ko sammilit nahin kiya gaya
 In a building, more damage is possible even in low wind speed due to poor construction
 phujita ne 1992 main in sanshayon ko dur karne kii koshish kii, parantu ve tab tak ardh sevanivritti main pahunch chuke the, tathaa neshnal wedar sarvice unke is kaary ko apnaane kii sthiti main nahin thi atah yah kaary adhuraa hi rah gaya
 The US and other countries abandoned the Fujita scale on 1 February 2007 and adopted the Enhanced Fujita scale
 yah mul phujita paimaane par kai tarah kii unnati tha, jaise ki bhinn sanrachanaon main hone vaali kshati kii bhinnata
 nae vistaarpurn va parishkrut kshati aankade va shreniyan ab ek niyat maanak praapt he, jab ki pehle yah aspasht tha
 This new scale also provides more accurate estimates of wind speed, as well as no upper air speed limit for EF5
 kai desh jaise ki canada or france, haalanki aaj bhi mul phujita paimaana hi prayog karte hai

 Global warming means the increase in the mean temperature of the Earth's near-surface air and ocean temperatures since the 20th century and its approximate continuity
 prithvi kii sataha ke nikat vishwa kii vaayu ke ausat taapmaana main 2005 tak 100 varshon ke dauraan 0
74 ± 0
18 °C kii vruddhi hui he
 The inter-government panel sitting on climate change concludes that "the increase in the world's average temperature since the middle of the 20th century is primarily due to man-made greenhouse gases
" jaisaa ki naam se hi spasht he, dharti ke vaataavaran ke taapmaana main lagaataar ho rahi vishwavyaapee badhotaree ko 'global varming' kaha ja rahaa he
 Our earth receives heat from the sun's rays
 ye kirane vayumandal se guzarati huin dharti kii sataha se takaraati hai or phir vahiin se paravartit hokar pun: laut jaati hai
 The Earth's atmosphere is made up of several gases, including some greenhouse gases
 inamen se adhikansh dharti ke upar ek prakaar se ek prakritik aavaran bana leti hai jo lautati kirnon ke ek hisse ko roak letaa he or is prakaar dharti ke vaataavaran ko garm banaae rakhata he
 It is worth noting that at least 16 degree Celsius temperature is necessary for humans, creatures and plants to survive
 vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki greenhouse gaison main badhotaree hone par yah aavaran or bhi saghan yaa motaa hota jaataa he
 In such a situation, this cover starts to prevent more rays of the sun and then from here the effects of global warming begin
 ipisisi dwaara diye gayi jalwaayu parivartan ke model ingit karte hai ki dharaatal kaa ausat global taapmaana 21veen shatabdi ke dauraan or adhik bad saktaa he
 This rise in the temperature of the whole world can cause sea level rise, rise in extreme weather and significant changes in the amount and composition of rainfall
 global varming ke anya prabhaavon main krishi upaj main parivartan, vyapaar margon main sanshodhan, glacier kaa peeche hatana, prajatiyon ke vilupt hone kaa khatra aadi shaamil hai
 "global warming" refers to the warming in recent decades and its persistence, and its indirect effects on humans
 jalwaayu parivartan par sanyukt raashtra samjhaute kii ruparekha main "maanav dwaara kiye gaye parivartanon ke liye "jalwaayu parivartan or anya parivartano ke liye "jalwaayu parivartanshiltaa" shabd kaa istemaal kiya he
 The term "climate change" assumes that rising temperatures are not the only effect
 The term "anthropogenic global warming" is used many times when the focus is on human-induced change
 prithvi kii jalwaayu bahari dabaav ke chalate parivartit hoti rahati he jisamen surya ke chaaron ore iske apni kaksha main hone vaale parivartan bhi shaamil hai
 The pressure on the orbit also changes the concentration of solar flashes, volcanic eruptions, and atmospheric greenhouse gases
 vaigyanik aam sahmati hone ke baad bhi haal hi main hui garmi main vruddhi ke vistrut kaaran shodh kaa vishay hote hanyah he ki maanviya gatividhiyon ke kaaran vaataavaran kii greenhouse gaison main vruddhi se hone vaali adhikansh garmi ko audyogic yug kii shuruyaat ke baad se dekha gaya
 This credit goes to the most recent 50 years for which data are available
 aam sahmati ke vichaar se alag kuch anya sankalpanaaon kaa suzav adhikansh taapmaana vruddhi kii vyakhya karne ke liye diya jaataa he
 One such hypothesis proposes that heat can be a result of solar activity in different forms
 baadhyataa kaa koi bhi prabhaav taatkaalik nahin he
 The heat inertia of the Earth's oceans and the slow response to many indirect effects mean the Earth's current temperature is not in equilibrium with the pressure exerted on it
 Studies of climate commitment show that if greenhouse gases are stabilized at 2000 levels So to some extent even beyond this
 garmi dikhaai degi The greenhouse effect was discovered in 1824 by Joseph Fournier and was first quantitatively investigated in 1896 by Scenti Arness
 yah prakriya dwaara jo avasorana or utsarjan ke avarakt vikiran dwaara vaataavaran main garm gaisen vaataavaran main ek or grah kii sataha kam he
 The existence as a greenhouse effect is thus not disputed
 swaabhaavik rup se green house gaison ke paas hone kaa matlab he ek garmi ke prabhaav ke bare main 33 degree celsius, jo prithvi par rahane yogya nahin honge
 
 Important greenhouse gases on the earth are water vapor, which produces a greenhouse effect of 36–70 percent); carbon dioxide that produces up to 9–26 percent greenhouse effect; methane up to 4-9 percent and ozone, which produces up to 3-7 percent effect
 The issue is how the power of the greenhouse effect changes when atmospheric concentrations of certain greenhouse gases increase from human activity
 audyogic kranti ke baad se maanvi gatividhi main vruddhi hui he jiske kaaran green house gaison ki maatra main bahut jiyaada vruddhi hui he, iske kaaran vikaranshil baadhya CO se2, methane, tropospheric ozon, siefasi or s nitrous bhi bahut bad gaye hai Iagara anu ki drushti se dekhen to methane greenhouse gasccharbon dioxide kii tulana main adhik prabhavi he, par uski sandratha itani kam he ki uskaa vikaranshil jor carbon dioxide ki tulana main keval ek chauthai he praaqatik rup se utpann hone vaali kuch duusari gaise greenhouse prabhaav main yogadan detii hai
 One of these nitrous oxide is developing due to human activities like agriculture! Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and CH4 have increased by 31% and 149% respectively since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1700th century
 pichley 650,000 varshon ke dauraan kisi bhi samay se in staron ko kaaphi adhik mana ja rahaa he
 This is the period for which the reliable figures are ice cores
 Are derived from
 kam pratyaksh bhuvaigyanik pramaan se yah mana jaataa he ki CO2 kii itani zyada maatra pichhali baar 20 karod varsh pehle hui thi
 Burning of fossil fuels has increased at least one-third of the increase in CO2 from human activities in the last 20 years
 shesh kaary bhoomi ke upyog main parivartan ke kaaran se hota he visheshkar wanon kii kataai se aisa hota he
 Current vaso-atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are approximately 385 per million ppm) by volume
 bhavishya main CO2 kaa str zyada hone ki ashanka he kyunki jeevashm eendhan or bhoomi ke upyog main kaafii parivartan aa rahe hai vruddhi k dar anishchit aarthik, saamaajik, takneekee or prakritik ghatnaon par nirbhar karegi par shaayad aakhirkaar jeevashm eendhan kii uplabdhta hi nirnaayak sabit ho ipisisi kii utsarjan paridrishyon par vishesh report bhavishya ke kai CO2 paridrishyo ke bare main bataati he jo 2100 ke akhir tak 541 se lekar 970 pipiem tak ho sakate hai
 There are sufficient reserves of fossil fuels to reach this level and to continue emissions even after 2100 if coal, sand sand or methane claretrate are widely used
 jalwaayu par baadhk ghatakon ke prabhaav vibhinn prakriyaaon dwaara jatil ho jate hai
 One of the most obvious responses relates to water evaporation
 carbon daai oxide jaisi dirghakaalin greenhouse prabhaav vaali gaison ke milane se paidaa hone vaali garmi vayumandal main jal ke adhik maatra main vashpikaran kaa kaaran banataa he
 Because water vapor itself is a greenhouse gas, it makes the atmosphere even hotter and it changes more water vapor into B) and this reaction continues until the recycling cycle is stopped
 Its effect from oxide will be huge
 yadhyapi pratyuttar kii yah prakriya vaayu kii nami ke kanon main badhotari karti he, tab bhi saapeksh ardrata yaa to sthir rahati he yaa thodi si ghat jaati he kyonki vaayu garm ho jaati he
 This effect of response can only be reversed slowly as carbon dioxide has a longer atmospheric lifespan
 badalon se prabhavit hone vaale pratyuttar ek nirantar chalane vaali prakriya he
 Seen from below, the cloud emits infrared radiation back to the surface and exerts a heat effect, seen from above, the clouds and sunlight emit space to reflect infrared radiation and therefore exert a cooling effect
 shuddh prabhaav kya garm athwa thanda he yah badal kii kism or unchai jaise vivaranon par nirbhar karata he
 These descriptions on climate models are difficult to demonstrate because clouds are much smaller than the points between spaces on computer mines of climate models
 jaise jaise vayumandal garm hota jaataa he vaise vaise paramarshi pratyuttar kii prakriya chook dar main parivartan se sambandhit hoti he
 As the temperature in the troposphere increases, the temperature of the atmosphere decreases
 avarakt vikiran kaa utsarjan taapmaana kii chauthi shakti par nirbhar karata he, vaataavaran kii upari tah se zyada lambi vikiran utsarjit hoti he or nichali tah se yah kam hoti he
 Most of the radiation that is emitted from the upper atmosphere goes into the hole, while the radiation emitted from the lower atmosphere is again absorbed by the atmosphere
 is prakaar, green house prabhaav vaataavaran main taapmaana ke oonchai ke saath kam hone kii raftaar pe nirbhar karata he, agar taapmaana kii dar kam he to green house asar zyada hoga or agar taapmaana girane kii dar kam he to green house asar kam hoga
 Both the theory and the model indicate that warming will reduce the temperature drop with altitude, creating a negative lapse rate feedback and weakening the greenhouse effect
 oonchai ke saath taapmaana parivartan kii dar kaa maapan choti-choti trutiyon ke prati bahut savendenshil hota he, isse yah pataa karnaa bahut mushkil ho jaataa he ki model hakeekat se mail khaataa he ke nahin 
 Another important process is the ice 'albedo response when the global temperature increases, then the ice near the poles starts melting at a faster rate
 jaise jaise barf pighalati he vaise vaise bhoomi athwa khulaa jal uskaa sthsthaan le letaa he
 Both land and water are less reflective than ice and therefore absorb more amount of solar radiation
 isse adhik garmi ho jaati he jiske kaaran or adhik barf pighalane lagati he tathaa yah chakra chalata rahata he
 Positive reorientation that occurs due to the emission of CO2 and CH4 is another reason that increases warming
 yah gaisen jamate hue permphrost jaise kii jamaa hui lakdi, siberia main daldal se paidaa hoti hai
 Likewise, methane clathrate, which is found in the oceans, emits enormous amounts of CH4, can be a major cause of warming, as the clathrate gun hypothesis states
 jaise jaise samudr garm hota jaataa he vaise vaise carbon ko alag karne kii kshamta ghatati jaati he
 This is because the declining levels of nutrients in the mesopelagic region are impeding the development of diatoms and favor small phytoplankton that are biological pumps of carbon
 pichley 30 varshon se Some papers suggest that the Sun's contribution has been underestimated
 Duke University ke do shodhakartaaon, Bruce West or Nicola Scafetta ne yah anumaan lagaaya he ki surya ne 1900-2000 tak shaayad 45-50 pratishat tak taapmaana badhaane main yogadan diya he or 1980 or 2000 ke bich main lagbhag 25-35 pratishat tak taapmaana badhaaya he
 Climate models have been found by Peter Scott and other researchers to overestimate the effects of greenhouse gases and do not give much importance to solar forcing, suggesting that volcanic dust and sulfate aerosols are also underestimated
 Despite solar forcing, much of the warming is likely to be caused by greenhouse gases, especially from the mid-20th century
 ek anumaan yah he ki alag alag alag roopon main saura nirgam, jo kii badalon ke bannane se, jo kii gaalactic brahmadia kirnon dwaara banate hai, ne bhi haal kii varming main hissedari kii he
 It has also been suggested that the magnetic activity in the Sun also triggers cosmic rays which affect the condensation nuclei of clouds and also affect the climate
 surya kii gatividhi kaa ek asar yah bhi hoga kii isse stretosphior garm ho jaayegi, jabaki green house gas siddhant vahaan par shitalan kii bhavishyavaanee karata he
 This trend has been observed since the stratosphere has cooled since the 1960s
 stratosferick ozon kii katautee ke kaaran sheetaltaa bhi paidaa hoti he, par ozon riktikaran 1970 ke dashak ke ant tak nahin hua
 Due to solar variation and volcanic activity, from the industrial age to the 1950s, the heat did not increase but only cooling
 2006 main peter fokal or sanyukt rajya america, germany or switzaraland ke anya shodhakartaaon ne paaya kii surya kii chamak main pichley 1000 saalon se koi parivartan nahin aayaa he
 The solar cycle has increased by only 0
07 percent in the last 30 years
 global varming ke liye yah bahut chota tathaa mahatvapurn yogadan dene vaala prabhaav he
 a research by Mike Loquood and Klaus Frohlich found that since 1985, there is no correlation between global warming and solar radiation, whether it is solar energy or cosmic rays

 According to the instrumental temperature record, the temperature of the Earth, whether on land or at sea, has increased from 1860–1900
 This increase in temperature is not affected by the urban heat island effect
 From 1079, the temperature of the land is almost double than the sea temperature
 The temperature in the lower troposphere is between 0
12 and 0
22 ° c per decade, as satellite data suggests
 It is believed that temperatures have remained relatively stable for the last one or two thousand years before 1850, with some regional fluctuations such as the Medieval Warm Period or the short icy era samudr main taapmaana zamin ke mukaable dhire badate hai kyunki mahasaagaron kii adhik heat capcity adhik hoti he or ve vashpikaran se jiada garmi kho sakate hanutari golardh main zamin jiada he isliye vah dakshini golardh kii tulana main jaldi garm hota he utari golardh main mausami barf or samudri barf ke vyapak ilaake hai jo kii ice-albedo feedback par nirbhar karte hai utari golardh main dakshini golardh ke mukaable adhik green house gaisen utsarjit kii jaati hai, par yah garmi main antar ke liye jimmedaar nahin he kyunki pramukh green house gaisen kaafii samay tak rahati hai or donon golardho main acchhee tarah ghul-mil jaati hai Based on estimates from nasa's Institute for Space Studies, 2005 was the hottest year, since the instrument of measurement became available in the late 1800s, breaking the 1998 record by a few hundredths of a degree from the World Meteorological Organization and Climate Research Unit The estimates drawn by 2005 concluded that 2005 was the second hottest year after 1998, as the temperature was unusually high in 1998 because that year El Niño's southern oscillations occurred Anthropogenic utsarjan ke anya pradooshak -visheshkar sulphate arosol sa-thanda karne vaala prabhaav daalate hai kyunki yah aati hui surya kii raushnee ko pratibimbit kar dete hai yah ek aanshik kaaran he us shitalan kaa jo beesvi sadi ke madhya main paaya gaya haalanki prakritik parivartanshiltaa ke kaaran bhi thandapan ho saktaa he
 James Hansen and his colleagues have proposed that the substances emitted from burning fossil fuels —CO2 and aerosols — have eliminated each other's effect, so the heat is mostly due to non-co2 greenhouse gases

 The issue of climate change has brought a new controversy about whether reducing industrial emissions of greenhouse gas is beneficial or the expenditure on it is harmful, many countries have discussed how much it will cost and how much to adopt alternative energy sources
 Companies like Competitive Enterprise Institute and exxonmobil have said that we should not take such steps by imagining the worst of the climate

 The arrival of light on the Earth, which is called irradiance, may have reduced global warming in the 20th decade, because less light had come to the Earth then from 1960 to 1990 man-made aerosols increased this effect even more by scientists

 Acharya Prafulla Chandra Rai was a born patriot
 unki aatmakatha main iske pramaan sthaan-sthaan par prakat hue hai
 While studying modern chemistry in Edinburgh, he used to worry about why India is not contributing in the field of science
 yahaan 1885 main unhone ek nibandh pratiyogita main bhaag liya jiskaa vishay tha- "bharat-gadar ke pehle or baad"
 He severely criticized the British Raj in his article
