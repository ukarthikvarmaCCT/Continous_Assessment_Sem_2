 Another method of applying hard ground is by liquid hard ground
 yah ek peepe main aata he or ise nakkashi kii jane vaali plate par ek brush ke jariye lagaaya jaataa he
 Hard ground hardens when exposed to air
 kuch mudrakatil / tarkol aadhaarit asphafaltem yabitumen kaa hard ground ke rup main upyog karte hai, haalanki bitumen kaa istemaal aksar steel platon ko jang se or tambe ke platon ko purana hone se bachaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Soft ground also comes in liquid form and is dried but it is not dry like hard ground and can leave its effect
 soft ground ko sukha liye jane ke baad mudrak isapar kuch samagriyon kaa upyog kar saktaa he jaise kii pattey, vasteen, haath ke print or isi tarah kii chijen jo soft ground main chhed kar detii he or iske neeche kaa plate baahar nikal aata he
 The ground can also be applied in a fine mist using powdered rosin or spray paint
 is prakriya ko equatint kehete he or yah rangon ke tone, shadow or thos kshetron ko taiyaar karne main madad karata he
 The design is then made using an etching needle or epc
 "echap" point, ek saadhaaran temprd steel kii eaching sui se 45-60 degree ke kone par ek carbrandam pathar ke peeche ghiskar taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he
 "acup" works on the same principle that the line of a fountain pen looks much more attractive than at a ballpoint: a slight difference in swelling is due to the natural movement of the hand that "warms" the line, and although It is rarely found in an individual line, leaving a very attractive impression overall on the final plate
 ise ek saadhaaran sui ke rup main usee tareeke se taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he
 The plate is then completely immersed in an acid that cleans the exposed metal
 tambe yaa jaste kii platon par eaching ke liye ferick chloride kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he jabaki nitric acid kaa prayog jaste yaa steel ke platon par eaching ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Special types of solutions contain 2 parts fecl3 to 2 parts water and 1 part nitric to 3 parts water
 acid kii kshamta eaching prakriya kii gati ko nirdhaarit karti he
 During the etching process the printers use bird fin or something similar to remove the bubbles and erosions prepared during the dissolving process, the plate can be removed from the surface or by periodically dipping the plate in an acid tub
 is
 agar bulbule ko plate par rahane diya jaataa he to yah acid ko plate main kataai karne se roak detaa he jahaan par bulbula ise choota he
 Zinc produces bubbles far more rapidly than copper and steel, and some artists use it in their prints to create an interesting spherical bubble-like sphere for a Mickey Way effect
 zinc or adhik bulbule adhik tambe or ispaat or kuch kalakaaron kii tulana main teji se utpaadan kaa upyog yah unka ek akashganga prabhaav ke liye print ke bheetar rochak daur bulbule kii tarah halkon kaa nirmaan karne ke liye
 Aparad is a powdery molten metal that fills the carved grooves and prevents acid from being uniformly cut across the exposed surfaces of the plate
 aparad ko plate se hataane kaa doosraa tarika plate ke nakkashi kiye gaye hisse ko neeche acid ke andar plasticine gendon yaa pathar par rakhana he haalanki is takanic kii ek kami bulabulon kaa baahar nikal aana or unhen tatkaal hataa paane main aksham hona he
 Printers often use a test strip of metal about one centimeter to three centimeters wide for aquatinting
 strip ko ek vishisht sankhya ke minute yaa second tak acid main dubaaya jaataa he
 After this the metal strip is removed and the acid is washed with water and cleaned
 pattee ke ek hisse ko ground main dhank diya jayega or phir pattee ko dubaara acid main dubaaya jayega or yah prakriya phir se doharaai jaayegi
 iske baad ground ko pattee se hataa diya jayega or pattee par syaahi daali jaaegi or print kiya jayega
 isse mudrak ko nakkashi kii gayi akruti ke alag-alag digriyon yaa gaharaai kaa pataa chal jayega or isiliye syaahi ke rang kii kshamta is baat par nirbhar karti he kii plate ko kitni der acid main rakhaa gaya he
 The plate is removed from the acid and washed with water to remove the acid
 ground ko tarpin jaise ek vilaayak se hataaya jaataa he
 Turpentine is often removed from the plate using methylated spirits because turpentine is smooth and can affect ink use and plate printing
 spit-biting ek aisi prakriya he jisase mudrak plate ke kuch khaas kshetron main ek brush ke jariye plate par acid kaa prayog karte hai
 For this purpose the plate can be aquatinted or exposed to acid directly
 is prakriya ko "spit-biting" isliye kaha jaataa he kyonki isamen laar kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jiskaa upyog kabhi acid ko dilut karne ke liye kiya jaataa tha haalanki ab aam taur par gam arbik yaa pani kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 a plastic card, a piece of mat board or a bunch of cloth is often used to make the ink enter the incised lines
 iske baad sataha ko steeff fabric ke ek tukade se saafe kar diya jaataa he jise tarlatan kehete hai or phir ise newsprint paper se saafe kar diya jaataa he, kuch mudrak apane anguuthe ke aadhaar par apane haath yaa hatheli ke blade bhaag kaa upyog karnaa pasand karte hai
 By cleaning, the ink remains in the incisions
 antim safai ke liye aap organja resham ke ek mude hue tukade kaa bhi istemaal kar sakate hai
 If copper or zinc plates are used, the surface of the plate becomes very clean and that is why it is white in print
 agar steel ke plate kaa prayog kiya jaataa he to plate ke swaabhaavik daant print ko equatinting ke prabhaav ke saamaan ek chikani prishth bhoomi dete hai
 As a result, steel plates do not require aquatinting because gradual exposure of the plate will give the same result when immersed continuously in acid
 kaagaj kaa ek nam tukdaa plate par rakhaa jaataa he or ise press ke madhyam se chalaaya jaataa he
 Growing concerns about the health effects of acids and solvents led to the development of less toxic methods of etching in the late 20th century
 An early invention for the coating was the use of floor wax as a hard ground
 mark jafraun or kith harvard jaise anya mudrakon ne ground ke rup main acrylik polimar or eaching ke liye ferick chloride kaa upyog karne vaali pranaliyaan viksit kii
 polimaron ko solvaints kii bajaay sodium carbonate se hataaya jaataa he
 When used for etching, ferric chloride does not produce a corrosive gas like acid, thus eliminating the second danger of conventional etching
 paramparaagat equatint, jo powder yukt regin yaa anamel spray paint kaa upyog karata he, isaki jagah par acrelic polimar hard ground ke ek airbrush aplicoshan kaa upyog hota he
 Also, no solvent is required other than soda ash solution, although a ventilation hood is required due to the air brush spray acrylic materials
 paramparaagat soft ground, jisamen plate se hataane ke liye solvaints kii aavashyaktaa hoti he isaki jagah jal-aadhaarit relif printing syaahi kaa prayog hota he
 The ink receives impressions like traditional soft ground, resists ferric chloride etchant, yet it can be cleaned with hot water and soda ash solution or ammonia
 audyogic prakriyaaon main anodic eaching kaa upyog ek sadi se bhi adhik samay se kiya ja rahaa he
 Etching is a source of power direct current
 nakkashi kii jane vaali saamagree ko iske dhanatmak dhruv se jod diya jaataa he
 a receiver plate is attached to its negative pole
 donon ko thodaa alag-alag rakhaa jaataa he or ise ek upyukt electrolite ke ek upyukt jaleey ghol main dubaaya jaataa he
 The electricity pushes the metal out of the anode into the slurry and deposits it as a metal at the cathode
 1990 se kuch hi samay pehle swatantra rup se kaam karne vaale do samoohon ne integleo printing platon ko taiyaar karne main iske upyog ke alag-alag tareeke viksit kiye
 The patented electrotech system, invented by Marion and Omri Behr, can be reworked on a carved plate as many times as the artist wishes, in contrast to some of the non-toxic methods of etching
 yah pranali 2 volt se kam bijli kaa istemaal karti he jo nakkashi kiye gaye hisson main dhaatu ke asmaan crystalon ko ujagar karti he jiskaa parinaam syaahi kaa utkrisht pratidhaaran hota he or jisaki mudrit chhavi ke swarup kii gunvattta paaramparik acid vidhiyon ke samanaantar hoti he
 The polarity, as opposed to the minimum voltage, provides a relatively simple way of preparing mezzontint plates as well as "steel facing" copper plates
 prakaash ke prati samvedansheel polimar platen photorialistic eaching kii anumati detii hai
 a photo-sensitive coating is used on the plate by the plate supplier or artist
 ise ujagar karne ke liye ek negative image ke rup main plate par prakaash ko kendrit kiya jaataa he
 Photopolymer plates are washed either in hot water or in other chemicals according to the plate manufacturers' instructions
 plate par se antim chhavi ko alag karne ke liye eaching se pehle photo-ech image ke kshetron ko stoppd-out kiya ja saktaa he yaa ek baar plate ko nakkashi kiye jane ke baad scraping yaa burnishing ke jariye ise hataaya yaa halkaa kar diya jaataa he
 Once the photo-etching process is complete, the plate can be used as a normal intaglio plate for dry point, next etching, engraving, etc
 antim parinaam ek aise integleo plate ke rup main hota he jise kisi anya kii tarah upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Copper has always been a traditional metal and is still preferred for etching as it harvests in a uniform manner, retains the texture well and does not destroy the color of the ink when cleaned
 jasta tambe se sasta he isiliye shuruyaat karne waalon ke liye behatar he, lekin yah tambe kii tarah utani safai se kaat nahin paata he or yah syaahi ke kuch rangon ko badal detaa he
 Steel's popularity as an etching substrate is increasing
 tamba or jasta kii keemton ne steel ko ek sweekaarya vikalp bana diya he
 The line quality of steel is somewhat less good than copper but it is better than zinc
 steel ek prakritik or unnat equatint he
 Etching is also used in the manufacture of printed circuit boards and semiconductor devices), on glass, and in preparing metal samples for microscopic observation
 mudrakon ke liye acid ke prabhaavon ko niyantrit karne ke kai tareeke hai
 Most commonly the plate surface is covered with a hard, waxy "ground" that resists acid
 iske baad mudrak ek nukile point se ground ko khurachataa he jisase dhaatu kii ve line ujagar ho jaati hai jinpar acid kaa dushprabhav padaa he
 Aquatint is a change in which a specific resin is split uniformly on a plate, then heated to produce a screen ground of a uniform but less than perfect density
 eaching ke baad koi bhi ujagar sataha ek kharaab sataha main badal jaati he
 Areas that are light in the final print are protected by varnishing between acid baths
 lagaataar varnishing kii prakriya dohraane or plate ko acid main rakhane se aise tone vaale kshetra taiyaar ho jate hai jise ek momyukt ground main drawing ke jariye praapt karnaa mushkil yaa asambhav hota he
 It consists of designs in a syrup-like solution of sugar or camp coffee painted on a metal surface before it is coated in a liquid etching ground or "stop out" varnish
 baad main jab plate ko garm pani main rakhaa jaataa he to chini ghul jaati he or image ko chhod kar baahar nikal aati he
 The plate can then be carved
 svachh acid or gam arabi kaa ek mishran jise dilachasp parinaam dene ke liye ek dhaatu kii sataha par tapakaaya, bikheraa yaa paint kiya ja saktaa he
 It is an etching technique invented in 2006 by Rand Huebsch, an American printer
 carborandam grit ke chote-chote kanon ko acid-pratirodhi ground main milaayaa jaataa he jise hameshaa kii tarah nangi dhaatu par brush kiya jaataa he or sookhne ke liye chhod diya jaataa he
 When that mixture dries, a metal stylus is used on the plate and in this way some dust particles are removed, so that minor areas of copper are exposed to the acid and carved, eventually they are used in the printing process
 Let's grab the ink
 is prakaar kaagaj par bani image kii banaavat charcol kii drawing ke samaan hoti he
 Printing on the plate is done by covering the surface with ink, followed by rubbing away the ink on the surface with a tarlatan cloth or newsprint, leaving the ink in the ruffled areas and lines
 geele paper ko plate par rakhaa jaataa he or donon ko ek printing press main daalkar sanchalit kiya jaataa he; dabaav paper ko syaahi ke sampark main laata he or image sthanantarit ho jaataa he 
 durbhaagya se yah dabaav plate main maujuud image ko kuch had tak kharaab bhi kar detaa he, kharaab kiye gaye kshetron ko chikna karte hue or linon ko band karte hue; tambe kii plate kahin behatar hoti he jisase kalakaar dwaara is kharabi ko bahut adhik samajhe jane se pehle ek acchhee tarah se nakkashi kii gayi image ke kai sacde print liye ja sakate hai
 In that case, the artist can recreate the plate by re-carving it by hand, essentially by reversing the ground and rediscovering their lines; Alternatively, plates can be electro-plated with a hard metal to protect the surface before printing
 jaste kaa bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he kyonki ek naram dhaatu ke rup main nakkashi kiye jane kaa samay chota hota he, haalanki yah narmi press main image ke teji se kharaab hone kaa bhi kaaran banati he
 Fox-byte or "over-biting" is common in etching and is the effect of a low amount of acid that leaks through the ground, causing minor stains and burn marks on the surface
 is aakasmik kharabi ko sataha kii chiknayee or polish ke jariye dur kiya ja saktaa he, lekin kalakaar aksar fox-bite chhod dete hai yaa plate kaa kharaab tareeke se upyog kar jaan-boojhkar ise chhod dete hai kyonki ise ek prakriya ke ek vaanchhneeya chihn ke rup main dekha jaataa he

 farsi bhashaa or sahitya apni madhurata ke liye prasiddh he
 Persian is the language of the country of Iran, but its name is Persian because the inhabitants of Persia, which is actually the name of a province of Iran, first made political progress
 is kaaran log sabase pehle isi praant ke nivaasiyon ke sampark main aae at: unhone saare desh kaa naam 'persis' rakh diya, jisase aajkal europea bhashaaon main iran kaa naam persia, pers, presian aadi pad gaya
 Persian language belongs to the Aryan family of languages to which Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, English, French, German etc
 are also associated
 'iran' shabd kaa vaastavik rup "aryaana" tha, jaisaa yavan lekhak likhte hai
 Gradually the word Iran came out of Aryana
 yavan lekhakon ne aryaana shabd kaa aadhunik iran tathaa afghanistan donon ke liye prayog kiya he
 Persian belongs to the eastern branches of Aryan languages
 iske pracheenatam namoonay parsiyon kii dharmik pustak avesta kii gaathaon main milte hai
 a somewhat less ancient language is that found in articles inscribed on mountains, rocks by the emperors of Iran
 parantu in donon kii bhashaaon main vishesh antar nahin hai
 The modern language of Afghanistan ie Pashto is also derived from an Iranian language of the same time
 yah vah samay tha jab iran or bharat ko alag hue adhik samay nahin hua tha
 The ancient Iranian language, called the European author Zend and Sanskrit are so close and close to each other that Avesta saga can be translated word-per-word and verses into Vedic Sanskrit

 of Zoroastrians
 "bundahishn" bhi dharmik pustak he jo 12veen shatee isvi main likhi gai or jiskaa adhikansh kaaphi purana he
 "datistane Dinik" or religious sermon is the third book, in relation to which a scholar named West says that it is very difficult to translate
 "shinkad goomanik vijaar" naveen shatabdi isvi ke ant main likhi gai
 In this, Christian, Jews, Muslims, religions have objected to the objections of Zoroastrianism
 "manoe khirad" main parsi dharm ke bare main 62 prashnon ke uttar hai
 There is a very attractive book called "ardwiraf", which describes the Granthikar walking in the Baizantha, hell, etc

 The reasons for which the equilibrium, or health, of various parts of the body are destroyed and distortions occur in them, are called causative and their science is called etiology
 ye kaaran anek hai
 They are divided into the following parts: ye hetukikaarak jis prakaar se vikrutiyon ko utpann karte hai, usko rogajanan kehete hai
 The pathologies that occur in different parts of the body due to pathological causes are known as pathologies and the description of the metal organ or intent with these deformities is called the deformed body and the pathology of these deformities is pathology or pathology
 vikrutivigyaan kaa mukhya uddeshy vividh rogakaarakon se vibhinn ango main jo vividh vikrutiyaan utpann hoti he, unka kaaryakaaran bhav pradarshit karnaa he
 The main purpose of pathology is to give an explanation of the gross and subtle forms of those deformities and to clarify the symptoms arising from various diseases based on them
 yah uddeshy vividh vyaadhiyon se mrit vyaktiyon ke sampurna itihaas ke saath, maranottar pareekshan se unke sharir ke vibhinn dhatvashayadi angon ke bheetar paae janevaali vikrutiyon, kaa mail kiye bina siddh nahin ho saktaa
 Post mortem for pathology was introduced in Western countries in the 16th - 17th centuries
 morgagni ne san 1761 main uske purv kiye gaye saikadon shavpareekshanon kii chaanvin kar, unamem se saat sau shavpareekshanon ke vrittant ko brihad sangrah granth ke teen bhaagon main prakashit kiya
 In this treatise, the extent to which the signs and symptoms found in various organs of patients correlate with the anatomical malformations found within their bodies
 iske pashchaat hi vikrutivigyaan ko swatantra astitv praapt hua
 Rudolph Fikhons began using the microscope in the 19th century to test for physiologic malformations and published his treatise on cellular pathology in 1846 AD
 is granth ne rogon ke swaroop kii tathaa unke abhyas ke liye koun-cone se saadhan prayukt hone chahie or prayukt ho sakate hai, inke sambandh kii kalpana main kranti paidaa kii tathaa vikruti vigyaan ko, jo pehle roganidan ke antargat ek chota sa vishay tha, nidaan kaa ek uttam adhishthan bana diya
 Despite the latent malformations in the body parts, the reaction, swelling, renovation, growth inhibition, degeneration, tumor, etc
 are some common types of Ini-guinea
 sharir ke bheetar in vikrutiyon kaa swaroop jab aasaani se indriya grahya hota he, tab usko sthool vikruti kehete hai tathaa sookshm swaroop kii vikruti hone par in vikrutiyon ko dekhne ke liye jab sookshmdarshi yantra kii aavashyaktaa hoti he tab usko sookshm vikruti kehete hai
 Deformations emphasize the heterogeneity of various body parts and their anatomical and morphological changes and their functional changes in diseases
 saransh main vikrutiyon kaa ullekh vibhinn angon se sambandhit hota he or rog kaa ullekh adhiktar lakshanon se sambandhit hota he
 The disease remains in the form of malformations in the body from long ago
 keval vah bahut sookshm hone se indriyagrahya kam hokar buddhigrahya adhik hota he
 When complete body deformities and their causes are described according to the above general types, then it is called normal pathology and when each organ, intention or institution of the body is described independently of the above types of deformities
 Is, then it is called special pathology

 Causes - The following are the major causes of tissue tissue saransh main oothkakshay kaa mukhya kaaran dhamni, shiraaon tathaa keshikaon main avrodh kaa hona he

 It is such a special state of the body in which there is growth of body tissue
 saamanyat: arbud do prakaar ke hote hai : Soft tumors - These are fatal because they do not cause any harm to life
 ghaatak arbud- jin arbudon main vighatan atyadhik hota he, unamem utak kii si akruti nahin banati
 Their composition is different from that of tissue and their growth is very rapid
 ve sharir main shighratapurvak prasaarit hokar andar hi andar swasth avyavon ko aakraant karte hai
 The action of this internal transmission is called metastasis
 is kaaran ye bahut maarak bhi hote hai or isi se inhen ghaatak, dusht, yaa chand arbud kaha jaataa he
 When there is an attack of any pathogenic bacteria in the human body, then the nature inside the body resists them the most, and in this war, the body's thick cells protect the body from disease by destroying the force of those external bacteria
 sharir ke andar se utpann isi roganashak shakti ko pratiraksha kehete hai
 There are two types of immunity: swaabhaavik pratiraksha - kisi rog ke pratirodh main sharir ke andar jo swaabhaavik shakti utpann hoti he use swaabhaavik pratiraksha kehete hai
 Earned immunity - If a person does not have the resistance to a particular disease and retrospectively by himself or by any other measures, he can be called acquired immunity
 udaahranarth, haija, chechak, motitora, titains ityadi paidaa karanevaale kuch rogaanu aise chote hai jo ek baar sharir main pravesh karne par rog paidaa kar sakate hai, parantu thodi maatra main pravisht karne par rog ke prati pratiraksha shakti utpann karte hai
 The reason for this is that a toxin produces disease in the body due to excessive intake, but the same toxin creates immunity by staying in very small amounts

 When the idea of weaning or a baby's voice is heard, this reflex can provoke a reaction, due to which the milk starts to leak out even when it is not wanting or even when the milk can come out of both the breasts when the infant Is drinking milk from the breast
 haalaanki, is tarah kii or anya prakaar kii samasyaayein aksar doodh pilaanaa shuru karne ke do saptaah ke baad dur ho jaati hai
 There may be difficulty in weaning due to stress or anxiety

 He knew that the British rule had been established on India and he thought it better to defeat the educational ground

 He was not only the confidant of his co-workers working in the English Parliament and the Cabinet, but was successful in gaining the wills and convictions of politicians across Europe
 casalare kaa europe jane or mitra-rashtron kii rajdhaniyon kii yatra karne kaa ekmaatr uddeshy in chaar bade-bade rashtron ko sangathit karke nepolian ke mukaable main khadaa karnaa tha
 At the same time, he wanted to establish an international association that could solve the problems facing the politicians of Europe
 casalare ke vichaar main rashtron kii niti main matbhedon ko dur karne, yuddh main vijay praapt karne or is prakaar shaanti sthapit karne ke liye shatru ke saamne samuhik rup se upasthit hone kaa sarvottam dhang bade-bade rashtron ke pradhanmantriyon main vichaaron kaa vishwast or khulaa aadan-pradaan tha
 In the twentieth century, the idea of calling plans to protect themselves from other nations did not appear to be new, but in the time of Castlere, such an idea was considered no less than a revolutionizing idea
 apane isi ek kaary main casalare itihaas ke ek mahaan shaanti sthapit karne vaale vyakti ke rup main prasiddh ho gaya
 Castlere had gone to Europe with the aim of bringing the four big nations closer to each other, and the two-month March, 1814 AD treaty treaty was his most important and a huge success
 is sandhi ke dwaara chaaron rashtron ne yuddh ko tab tak jari rakhane kii pratigya kii jab tak france shaanti kaa samjhauta karne ke liye taiyaar nahin ho jaataa
 Each of these nations accepted giving weapons etc
 for the war
 england ne shastron ke saath-saath prati varsh 50 lakh pound kii raashi deni bhi sweekaar kii
 This agreement was made for twenty years and the Allies pledged to fight collectively against France on behalf of Europe, for twenty years, when France tried to break the century of peace agreements
 is sandhi-patr par hastakshar kiye jane ke kuch samay pashchaat nepolian ko france ke singhaasana se utaar diya gaya or ab paris main samjhaute kii baatcheet armbh ho gai
 “england played friendly roles with Austria, Russia and Prasha at the vienna-congress
 england ko itane unche sthaan par pahunchane kaa shrey bahut kuch lard casalare ko hi tha jisko na keval british sansad or mantrimandal kaa vishwaas praapt tha balki jise europe ke raajnneetigyon ko vishwaas praapat karne main bhi safalataa mili
 In November 1815, Castlere did a very important job in preparing the peace treaty
 duk of vallington, meternikh tathaa jaar se use is kaary main vishesh sahaayta mili
 At the time of debate on a small stream of this treaty, Castlere had an opportunity to put his plan into action
 is prastaavit raajnneetigyon ko samay-samay par milanaa chaiye, kintu casalare ne is dhara kaa swaroop hi badal diya or shabdon tathaa bhaavon kii drushti se use bahut adhik nikhaar diya
 Now the new form of the stream has become- "to simplify and protect the work of implementing this treaty, and to make the relations of the four nations beneficial for the world and to strengthen the relations even more
 The main countries participating in the treaty acknowledge that they will continue to call the conference after the appointed time
 apane saamaanya hiton ke bare main vichaar-vimarsh karne ke liye or samyaanukool aavashyak tathaa laabhadaayak kadam uthaane ke liye tathaa deshen ko punah samrudh banane evam europe main shaanti kaayam rakhane ke liye sammelnon main yaa to in rashtron ke raja athwa unke pratinidhi bhaag lenge
 “the stream which was kept in the treaty by the efforts of Castlere was a big gift towards establishing peace in Europe
 isamen hamen rashtrasang or sanyukt rashtrasang ke dhoshna-patron kii jhalak milti he
 The joint system of Europe was also established on this basis
 durbhagyavash casalare kii yah aashaa buree tarah faleebhoot nahin ho saki ki europe ke vivaadon ko is sani dha kii dhara ke anusaar niyantrit kiye jane vaale sammelan sulajhaa liya karenge or is prakaar europe main shaanti bani rah sakegi
 The more Castlereau understood the importance of deciding problems and disputes by conventions, the more no one else understood
 sanyukt vyavastha ke sammelnon main duusare rashtron se, visheshkar austria se, britain kaa matbhed badhata hi gaya
 Wherever Maternich's diplomacy was to interfere everywhere at will, England's policy was as far-fetched as possible
 casalare yadhyapi chaturmukhi maitri se alag nahin hona chahta tha, kintu saath hi vah is baat par bhi tula hua tha ki vah duusare rashtron ke aanatarik maamalon main hastkshep kii niti ko safal nahin hone degaa
 Shortly before his death he was getting ready to attend the Berina-conference and had decided that he would prevent European nations from interfering in Spain and Ferdinand VII again
 durbhagyavash sammelan main bhaag lene se purv hi usne aatmahatya kar lee kintu uske uttaradhikari lard caning ne uske hi siddhanton par aacharan kiya
 According to Dr
 Mahajan, the importance of Castlere has come to be understood only in the modern era
 yah sach he ki vah europe ke rashtron ko shaanti bhang karne vaale aapasi jhagadon ko paraspar sahyog se sulajhane ke liye manwaane ke apane adarsh ko kriyaatmak rup dene main safal na ho sakaa parantu saath hi is baat se bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki use ne sabase pehle ve suzav pesh kiye jo ki aage chalakar lig of neshns ke convenint or sanyukt rashtrasang ke charter ke aadhaar bane
 Castlere's creations can only be judged by historians who study seriously
 ”casalare kii videsh niti“ naam kii pustak main vaibster ne casalare ko england ke itihaas main sarvshereshth videsh mantri mana he
 seaton-watson called Castlereau one of the best foreign ministers in the history of England and a foreign minister to build relationships
 casalare ke apane shabdon main ”shaanti sthapit karne ke liye kii gai sandhi kii safalta ke liye uskaa nyaaypurna or parimit hona aavashyak he
 Ideally, efforts should be made to create a sense of internal cooperation in a functional form
 great britain ko europe ke maamalon main apana karttavya puraa karnaa chaiye
 "in Webster's view, Castlere had understood that it was necessary to be prepared to survive the war
 casalare udaarvaad kaa bada samarthak tha
 The core elements of his foreign policy were peace, liberalism and segregation
 kintu, us samay europe main pratikriyaavaadi meternik kaa bada prabhaav tha
 Therefore, Castlere's policy in front of him could not succeed
 nisandeh, casalare europe main sthaayee shanti sthapit karne main safal nahin hua, tathapit uske suzav hi rashtrasang ke sanvida or sanyukt raashtra sangh ke charter ke aadhaar bane
 In his book Castlere's Foreign Policy, Webster considered Castlereau the best foreign minister in the history of England
 sitan-watasan ne casalare ko england ke itihaas main hue videsh mantriyon main se ek shreshth or sambandhon ko banane vaala videshmantri kaha he

 But there is no information regarding the schools for the training of veterinarian

 In the texts of 1900-1800 years before Christ, nuskha used on animal is found
