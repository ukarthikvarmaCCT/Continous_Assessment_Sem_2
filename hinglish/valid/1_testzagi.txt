 Novelist Orhan Pamuk was born in 1952 Istanbul! His parents were in engineering, so they were also advised to do the same! Despite this, he wanted to become a painter in his childhood, but suddenly his interest turned to literature and then he started writing from 1974! turki main iske liye main koi anukool raajnneetik-saamaajik paristhitiyaan nahin thi, ve jis bhashaa main likhte the, us hisaab bhi se vishwa-sahitya main sthaan bana paanaa kathin tha ! gharelu or bahari mushkilon ko jhelte hue hue bhi unhone apane lekhan ko ek majboot disha pradaan kii ! "trouble, divorce, father was dying, financial trouble, this trouble, that trouble, but i knew that if i am stuck here i will definitely go into mental disability, so i used to wake up every morning and take a shower under the shower
 And used to sit down writing, with the intention that i have to write a good and beautiful book! " - Pamuk orhan paamuk ko purv or pashchim ke bich ke tanaav par likhane ke liye janaa jaataa he
 This is the central role of his books in which he tries to explore the mental-ideological clash between two parts of the world
 orhan paamuk ko sachhee safalataa tab mili jab 'maai nem ij red' kitaab duniya bhar main pasand kii gai ! uske baad unhone 'snow' 'musium of inosense' 'istambul, memory and da city' aadi vividhta bhari behtareen kitaaben apane pathakon ko di, jo antarrashtiya str par bestceller sabit hui ! hindi main orhan paamuk kii teen kitaaben penguin books, dilli se prakashit hui hai, maai nem ij red' kaa hindi anuwaad 'mere qatl kii daastaan' naam se or snow tathaa da blike book inhi mul naamon se uplabdh he !

 In many plant species, the fruit also includes the surrounding ovary and surrounding tissue
 fal vah madhyam he jiske dwaara pushpiya padap apane bijon kaa prasar karte hai, haalanki sabhi beej falon se nahin aate
 No single definition can explain the enormous diversity found among the fruits of plants
 chhadmafal jaisaa shabd, anjir jaise falon yaa un padap sanrachanaon ke liye prayukt hota he jo fal jaise dikhte to he par mulat: unki utpapti kisi pushp yaa pushpon se nahin hoti
 Some unripe seeds, such as the fleshy seedling fruit of the yew, resemble the fleshy cones of some juniper resembling a berry
 fal shabd galat rup se kai shankudhari vrikshon ke beej-yukt maadaa shankuon ke liye bhi hota he
 Some of the real fruits of the botanical sense, in cooking and preparing food, are considered vegetables simply because they are not sweet
 in vanaspatik falon me kushmand, tamaato, matar, saim, makka, bangan or mithi mirch, kuch masaale jaise, alspice or mirch vanaspatik fal hai
 Sometimes, but very rarely, a culinary "fruit" is not an actual fruit in the botanical sense, for example, rhubarb is often considered a fruit because it is used to make confectionary, although only the stalk of the rhubarb is edible
 it happens
 paak sambandhi arth main, ek fal aamtaur par ek vanaspati utpaada hota he jiskaa swaad meetha hota he or isame beej hote hai, ek sabji ek feekaa yaa kam meetha vanaspati utpaada he or ek giri ek kathor telyukt or kholyukt vanaspati utpaada he

 There are one or more spores inside the ovary, where the magagamytophyte consists of magagamite or egg cells
 bijand ek prakriya jise paragan kehete hai, dwaara nishechit hota he, is prakriya me paraag kan pushpon ke punkesar se vartikagra ko sanchaarit hote hai
 After pollination, a tube is formed that travels from the stigma to the ovary spore where sperm from the pollen are transferred to the spore, forming a diploid zygote joining the sperm egg inside the spore
 pushpi padpon me nishechan kii prakriya donon plasmogami jahaan shukranu or andey ke protoplasm kaa sanlayan hota he, yaa cariogaimi jahaan shukranu or andey ke nabhik kaa milan hota he, ke dwaara ho sakati he
 The fertilization process is completed when the sperm enters the nucleus of the spore and joins the maggammite and embryo with the maternal cell
 jaise jaise vikasshil beej bada hota he andashay kaa paripakvan shuru hota jaataa he
 The spores develop into seeds, the ovary wall may become padded, or it may develop into a rigid outer covering
 kuch maamalon main, bahyadal, dal or / yaa punkesar or vartika jhad jate hai
 The fruit continues to develop until the seeds are fully mature
 kuch bahu biji falon main goode kaa vikaas is baat par nirbhar karata he ki kitne bijand nishechit huye hai
 The fruit wall develops from the wall of the ovary of the flower

 hormone ithaylin paripakvan kaa kaaran banataa he
 When other parts of the flower form an important part of the fruit in this way, the fruit is called the supporting fruit
 kyonki pushp ke anya bhaag fal kii sanrachana main yogadan kar sakate he isliye, ise samajhane ke liye pushpon kii sanrachana kaa adhyayan karnaa mahatvapurn he ki kaise yah ek fal ke rup me viksit hota he
 Considering the variety of fruits, it is very difficult to formulate a single classification scheme for all known fruits
 beej or fal ke liye kai saamaanya shabd galat rup se prayukt hote hai jo isaki shabdaawalee ko samajhnaa mushkil bana sakate hai
 Seeds are mature spores, fruits are mature ovaries that contain seeds
 in do mul paribhaashaon me yah spashtikaran bhi joda ja saktaa he ki vanaspati shabdaawalee main ek giri aam shabdaawalee ke vipareet na to ek fal kaa ek prakaar he or na hi beej kaa
 There are three basic types of fruits: simple fruits, tufted fruits and multicolored fruits
 ek saadhaaran yaa mishrit andashay jisame sirf ek punkesar ho ke pakane par ek saadhaaran fal praapt hota he jo sookhaa yaa goodedaar ho saktaa he
 Dry fruits can be explosive or explosive when cooked
 sookhe or saamaanya fal ke udhaaharan hai: vah fal jinamein fal bhitti kaa kuch bhaag yaa puri bhitti hi pakvan par maansal ho jaati he, saamaanya goodedaar fal kehalaate hai
 These fruits grow from a single flower with many simple stamens
 inkaa udhaaharan he rasabhari
 a multifunctional fruit is formed from a group of flowers
 har phool ek fal kaa nirmaan karata he lekin yah sab ek ekal pind ke rup me paripakv hote hai
 Examples of these are pineapples, edible figs, mulberry, dew-oranges and rotifal
 bijrahit yaa bijaviheen hona kuch falon kii ek mahatvapurn vyavsaayik visheshta he
 Commercial varieties of banana and pineapple are examples of seedless fruits
 nimbu-vanshi kuch falon kii kismein, satsumas, chini santare, chakotre or tarbooz kaa bijrahit hona inaki keemat badha detaa he
 In some species, seedlessness is the result of parthenocarpi, where the fruit is formed without any fertilization process
 parthenokarpik fal vah fal hote hai jo bina paragan ke bhi gathit ho sakate hai
 Most seedless citrus fruits require pollination motivation, whereas bananas and pineapples do not
 falon ke dhaanche main badlaav mukhyatah unke bijon ke prasar ke tareeke par nirbhar karata he
 This proliferation can be achieved by animal, air, water, or blast blasting

 Fruits also contain a number of phytochemicals that do not have RDA / RDI listings under most nutritional tables and research suggests that they are essential for keeping cells healthy for a long time and preventing diseases
 falon kaa niyamit seven cancer, hriday rog, pakshaaghaat, alzimer rog or motiyobind ke jokhim ko kam kar detaa he, saath hi yah badhati umr se judi kaaryaatmak giravat ko rokane me bhi madadgaar hai

 swayan antarnihit parisampatti ke vyapaar yaa vinimay ke badale vyutpaadan vyapaaree samay-samay par antarnihit parisampatti par aadhaarit nakad yaa parisampattiyon ke vinimay hetu ek samjhauta karte he
 a futures contract is a simple example of this, which is an agreement based on which the underlying asset is exchanged at a future date
 vyutpaadan praayah atyadhik uttolit hote hai, jisase ki antarnihit keemat main ek choti si gatividhi bhi vyutpaadan ke keemat main ek bahut bade antar kaa kaaran ban sakati he
 If the price of the underlying asset changes exactly as the investors predicted, then derivatives can be used by investors to estimate the profit and profit from it
 vaikalpik rup se, vyapaaree, antarnihit parisampatti ke jokhim se bachaav karne yaa use kam karne ke liye vyutpaadan kaa prayog kar sakate hai or iske liye ve ek vyutpaadan anubandh main pravesh karte hai jisaki keemat apane antarnihit sthiti kii vipareet disha main gati karata he or iske kuch yaa sampoorn bhaag ko radd kar detaa he
 Derivatives are generally broadly classified by: deryvative ek aisa anubandh he jiskaa mul kisi anternihit sampatti se paaya jaataa he
 Many commonly used instruments can be called derivatives because they derive their origin from a property
 udahaaran ke liye equity shares swayan ek deryvative he kyonki ye apana mul equity ke anternihit se nikalate he
 Similarly, one takes insurance for his house so that he can avoid all the risks of the house
 derevatives un sabhi pramuk vittiya sadhano par aadhaarit he jo spasht rup se equity, debt instruments, videshi mudra aadi ke rup main beche jate he
 Thus when we talk about derivatives, we often mean financial derivatives
 derevatives kahi prakaar ke hote he jaise- forwards, futures, vikalp or swaps
 Most derivatives are bought and sold on an exchange in the form of over-the-counter or Bombay Stock Exchange
 derevatives vittiya sadhano or anya do shares or debt ke teen pramukh kshrenio me se ek he
 1
 Derivatives can be tailored in such a way to cater to different needs of users by using either of the upper instruments or, using a combination of two or more devices
 2
 derevatives anternihit parisampattiyon ke bhavishya ke mulya andolanon ke bare me apekshau ke aadhaar par kaarobaar kiya ja saktaa he
 3
 They all have closed balance sheet devices
 4
 ve parisampatti mulyon ke utaar-chadhaav ke jokhim ko kam karne ke liye ek upkaran ke rup me istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 The important financial derivatives are as follows: - 1
 forwards 2
 Futures 3
 vikalp 4
 Swaps forwards sabhi derevatives ke sabase purana or pehla he
 a forward contract refers to the exchange of an agreed quantity of an asset for cash at a predetermined date in the future at an agreement between two parties
 vaada kiya parisampatti mudra, vastu, upkarnon, aadi ho saktaa he
 Example: On June 1, x buys 50 bales of cotton at an agreement on Y, on December 1 at a level of Rs
 1000 per bundle from a cotton trader
 yah ek anubandh he jaha X, y ke liye 1 disambar ko 5 xxrep 4 0 rupee kaa bhugtan karata he or y kapaas kii 50 ganthe x ko bechata he
 In a forward contract, a user who promises to buy a specified property at an agreed price in a certain future date is said to be in a 'long position'
 duusari ore, upyogkarta, jo ek bhavishya kii tarik me ek sahmati mulya par bechney ke liye vaada karata he wo ‘choti sthiti’ me hona kaha jaataa he
 Futures contract is where there is an agreement between two parties at an agreed price to exchange any asset or currency or commodity for cash at some future date
 donon anubandh karne ke liye partiyon ko ek duusare se aapasi vishwaas hona chahie
 It only takes place in the organized future market
 futures ke prakaar:- Futures can be divided into two types
 1
 camodity futures 2
 Financial Futures vikalp anubandh kharidaar par yaa bhavishya me ek nirdhaarit tithi se pehle ek purv nirdhaarit mulya par kharid yaa anternihit parisampatti, bajane ke liye ek vikalp detaa he
 The price that is predetermined is called the 'strike price' or 'exercise price'
 vikalp ke prakaar:- The option can be divided into two types
 1
 put vikalp 2
 Double Options put vikalp:- yah aisa vikalp he jo vikalp dharak ko nirdhaarit tithi se pehle purv nirdharik mulya par ek anternihit parisampatti ko bechney kaa adhikaar detaa he
 Double Option: - This is an option in which the option allows the holder to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price before a specified date in the future
 swap ek vyutpann anubandh ke madhyam se do pakshon ke vittiya sadhano kaa aadan-pradaan hota he
 It is an arrangement for the market for that matter to take profit arising from either money market or interest rate market fluctuations or any other market
 bachaav-vyavastha, jokhim ko samaapt karne yaa use kam karne ke liye nirmit ek takanic he
 Through derivatives, risk related to the price of the underlying asset can be transferred from one party to another
 udhaahranswaroop, gehun kii kheti karne vaala ek kisaan or uski pisai karne vaala ek miller, bhavishya main gehun ke ek nirdhaarit pariman ke liye ek nirdhaarit nakad raashi kaa vinimay karne ke liye ek bhavi anubandh par hastakshar kar sakate hai
 Both sides have reduced future risk: the farmer who cultivates wheat has reduced the risk of price uncertainty and Miller has reduced the risk of wheat availability
 haalanki, abhi bhi jokhim he kyonki anubandh main ghatnaon, jaise mausam nirdhaarit nahin he jisase ho saktaa he ki gehun uplabdh na ho yaa yah bhi ho saktaa he ki koi ek paksh anubandh kii sharton se mukar jaae
 yadhyapi is bhavi anubandh kii suraksha ke liye ek tritiy paksh hota he jise clearing house kehete hai, lekin pratipaksh jokhim ke viruddh sabhi vyutpaadan surakshit nahin hote hai
 From the other point of view, both the farmer and the miller mitigate a risk and earn a risk when they sign a future contract: the farmer minimizes the risk that the price of wheat will be lower than the price specified in the contract and that The risk accrues that the price of wheat will be higher than the price specified in the contract
 On the other hand, Miller earns the risk that the price of wheat will be lower than the price specified in the contract and reduces the risk that the price of wheat will be higher than the price specified in the contract
 is arth main, ek paksh jokhim ke ek prakaar ke liye bimakarta he or pratipaksh jokhim ke duusare prakaar ke liye bimakarta he
 Avoidance also occurs when a person or entity buys an asset and sells it using a futures contract
 ek vinirdisht samay ke liye is parisampatti par vyakti yaa sanstha kaa adhikaar hota he or tab vah ise bhavishya main bhavi anubandh ke anusaar ek vinirdisht keemat par bech saktaa he
 Of course, this gives the individual or entity the benefit of the right to the asset, while reducing the risk that the future selling price will unexpectedly deviate from the market's current valuation of the asset's future price
 vyutpaadan, ek vaid vyavsaayik uddeshy prastut karata he
 For example, a corporation borrows a large sum of money at a special interest rate
 rin kaa byaaj-dar prayek chah maheene par phir se nirdhaarit hota he
 The corporation is concerned that the interest rate may be very high in six months
 nigam ek agrasar dar samjhauta kharid saktaa he
 a forward rate agreement is a contract to pay a fixed interest rate for six months after making a purchase at a notional amount of money
 yadi chah maheenon ke baad byaaj-dar, anubandhit dar se adhik ho jaataa he to vikreta, nigam yaa FRA khariddaar ko is antar kaa bhugtan karata he
 If the rate is lower, the corporation will pay this difference to the seller
 FRA kii kharid, dar main vruddhi se sambandhit anischitata ko kam karne kaa kaam karegaa or kamai ko sthir rakhega
 Derivative can be used to acquire risk rather than to insure or prevent risk
 is prakaar, kuch vyakti or sansthaaen, antarnihit parisampatti ke keemat par satta lagane ke liye ek vyutpaadan anubandh kaayam karenge or shart lagaayenge ki antarnihit parisampatti ke bhavi keemat ke bare main beemaa kii maang karne vaala paksh galat sabit hoga
 Speculators would like to be able to buy an asset in the future at a lower price according to a derivative contract when the future market price is higher or to sell an asset in the future at a higher price according to a derivative contract when the future market price is lower
 vyakti or sansthaaen, antarpanan avasaron kii taak main bhi rah sakate hai jab kisi parisampatti kii maujuuda kharid keemat, parisampatti ko bechney ke liye bhavi anubandh main vinirdisht keemat se kam ho
 The speculative trade in derivatives came to great disrepute in the year 1995 when Nick Leeson, a businessman at Barings Bank, made very poor and unauthorized investments in future contracts
 kharaab nirnay, band ke prabandhak ke or niamakon ke paryvekshan kii kami or cobe main aae bukamp jaisi durbhagyapurna ghatnaon ke sangyojan ke madhyam se lisan ko $1

 It is widely said that there are two distinct groups of derivative contracts which differ from each other in the way they are traded in the market: vyutpaadan ke mukhya teen varg hai: More complex derivatives can be formed by combining these basic types of elements
 udhaahranswaroop, swapshan ke dharak ke paas ek vinirdisht bhavi tithi ko yaa usase pehle gamagam main pravesh karne kaa adhikaar, na ki daayitv, hota he
 There are five major classes of underlying assets in the overall derivatives market: in vyutpadanon ke kuch saamaanya udhaaharan is prakaar hai: Other examples of implicit interchangeable are: pakshon ke madhya bhugtan kaa nirdhaaran nimna dwaara kiya ja saktaa he: Some derivatives are rights to buy or sell the underlying security or commodity at a future time for a predetermined price
 yadi antarnihit pratibhuti yaa camodity kii keemat sahi disha main gati karata he to vyutpaadan ke maalik paise kamaate hai, nahin to unke dhan kaa nuksaan hota he yaa vyutpaadan bekaar ho jaataa he
 Depending on the terms of the contract, the potential profit or loss of an derivative may be relatively greater than it would be if the underlying securities or commodity were traded directly
 keemat ke do saamaanya maap hai: For exchange-trade derivatives, the market price is usually transparent
 However, complications may arise with OTC or flur-trade contracts as the trade is handled manually which makes it difficult for prices to spread automatically
 
 khaas taur par OTC anubandhon ke saath, keemton ko milaane or unke prasar ke liye koi vishesh vinimay nahin hota he
 The arbitrage-free price for a derivative contract is complex and has many different variables to consider
 antarpanan-mukt keemat nirdhaaran, vittiya ganit kaa ek mukhya vishay he
 The stochastic process of price of the underlying asset is often important
 saidhantik vikalp keemtankan kaa ek mukhya sameekaran, blike-scoles sutara hai jo is dharna par aadhaarit hota he ki ek europea stock vikalp se hone vaale nakad pravaah ko keval stock kaa prayog karke baar-baar kharidkar or bechakar doharaaya ja saktaa he
 a simplified version of this estimation technique is the binomial choice model
 vyutpadanon ko aksar nimnlikhit aalochanaon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he: The use of derivative can result in very large losses as it involves leverage or borrowing
 vyutpaadan kii sahaayta se niveshkon ko antarnihit parisampatti kii keemat main thodi si bhi halchal se adhik pratifal praapt ho saktaa he
 However, investors could also have lost a very large amount if the price of the underlying asset had a momentum against them
 vyutpaadan bazaaron main baari nuksaanon ke kai udhaaharan hai, jaise: Criticized Financial Market President Clinton's crew members: Larry Summers, Alan Greenspan, Arthur Levitt, and Robert Rubin for destroying attempts to regulate derivatives markets and thus aiding in the collapse of financial markets in Fall 2008
 has gone
 raashtrapati jorge dablyoo
 bush kii bhi ninda kii gai he kyonki ve varsh 2008 kii mandi se pehle 8 varshon tak raashtrapati the or vyutpaadan vyapaar ko viniyamit karne ke liye unhone kuch nahin kiya
 Bush has stated that regulation was one of the core principles of his political philosophy
 vyutpaadan niveshkon ko pratipaksh jokhim ke liye pradarshit karte hai
 For example, suppose that a person wants to take a loan for his business at a fixed interest rate but when he comes to know that banks only offer loans at variable rates and swap payment facility with the help of another business Provide for which they unrealistically create a fixed rate for the individual
 haalanki, yadi doosraa vyavsaay diwalia ho jaataa he, to yah apane parivartaneey dar kaa bugtan nahin kar saktaa he or isliye pehla vyavsaay apane nishchit dar kii suvidha ko kho degaa or phir se parivartaneey dar par bhugtan karne lagegaa
 If the interest rate is increased, it is likely that the first business may be adversely affected as it may not be ready to pay the higher variable rate
 is tarah se vibhinn prakaar vyutpadanaanon main vibhinn str ke jokhim hote hai
 For example, a standardized stock option by law requires the party to deposit a certain amount of money with the exchange in order to risk that it shows that they can pay in the event of any loss; Banks that help the business swap variable for fixed rates on loans can do a credit check on both sides
 haalanki do companiyon ke bich sthapit nijee samjhauton main, udhaaharan ke liye, rin udhyam or jokhim vishleshan ke pradarshan ke liye maandand nahin bhi ho sakate hai
 Derivatives create unreasonable excessive risk amounts for small or inexperienced investors
 chunki vyutpaadan adhik laabh kii sambhaavna pradaan karte hai, isliye ve vyakti-vishesh niveshkon ke liye bhi ek aakarshan pradaan kar dete hai
 However, derivatives betting, especially for the small investor, often assumes too much risk and requires consistent experience and market knowledge that is part of the reason why some financial planners use these forms Advises against
 vyutpaadan jatil prapatr hai jise beemaa ke prakaar ke rup main nirmit hota he jo pakshon ke madhya unki ichha ke aadhaar par jokhim kaa hastantaran karte hai jisase atirikt jokhim yaa isse bachaav kii kalpana kii ja sake
 Derivatives leverage debt broadly in an economy, making the underlying real economy more nervous in servicing its debt obligations, thus cutting down on real economic activity that could result in recession or even There can also be disappointment

 Accordingly, "consequentialism" is an ideology that gives its functional influence or fruit a very important place in all fields of knowledge
 iske anusaar hamaari sabhi vastuvishyak dharanaayen unke sambhav vyaavhaarik parinaamon kii hi dharanaayen hoti hai
 Therefore, to get any thing or idea right, it is necessary to test its practical results
 prayojanavaad ek naveentam darshanik vichaardhaara he
 In the present era, this ideology is the most recognized among the various ideologies of philosophy and education
 yatharthwaad hi ek aisi vichaardhaara he jiskaa bijaropan maanav-mastishk main ati pracheen kaal main hi ho gaya tha
 Realism, rather than a name of a well-formed philosophical ideology, represents all ideas that believe that the object exists independently
 adarshavaadi yah maanata he ki ‘vastu’ kaa astitv hamaare gyaan par nirbhar karata he
 If this idea is correct then the object has no position
 iske thik vipareet yathartwaadee maanate hai ki vastu kaa swatantra astitv he chaahe vah hamaare vichaaron main ho athwa nahin
 Both the object and its related knowledge are separate entities
 sansar main anek aisi vastuein hai jinke sambandh main hamen jaankaree nahin he parantu iskaa arth yah nahin he ki ve astitv main he hi nahin
 This is to say that the object has an independent position
 hamaara gyaan hamako uski sthiti se avgat karaata he parantu uske bare main hamaara gyaan na hone se uskaa astitv nasht nahin ho jaataa
 In the same way, realistic about the means of acquiring knowledge, scientific method like Purposeism considers only the best method and takes shelter of incorporation method
 prayojanavaadee vichaardhaara kaa udbhav kab hua tha yah to nishchit rup se nahin kaha ja saktaa, kintu phir bhi is vichaardhaara kii vishistataa ko dhyaan main rakhte hue yah avashya hi kaha ja saktaa he ki jab se manushya ne apni samasyaon evam kathinaaiyon ke kaarnon evam unke samaadhaan ke liye kiye gayi prayaason se praapt anubhavon kii satyata evam vyaavhaarikta ke sambandh main chintan prarambh kiya tabhi se is vichaardhaara kaa bijaropan ho gaya tha
 Certain proponents of this theory relate it to the Greek thinker Protagoras's "man is the measure of all things" - and also to the ancient philosophers, such as Socrates and Aristotle, as users of the Pregomatic method; But in fact it is a modern ideology and its principal proponents are the famous psychologist Pandit William James of the United States, the educationist John Dewey and the doctor F
 of Great Britain

 Because people fleeing Europe and England for religious freedom started believing in a peculiar functionality due to America's border-related freedom, so no ideology, other than for the hard-working beings to create new life, away from the digression of cultural values
 Was not suitable america jivan kaa yah ‘vaad’ pratibimb he
 This new philosophy was given full maturity by the greatest philanthropist, expert and propagator, the great philosopher, teacher and educationist John DV and therefore he is considered representative of Puritanism
 dow shiller ne maanviyatawad naamak siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya he jise vastav main falanumeyapramanyawad kii ek shakha hi samajhnaa chahie
 Almost all of James's works are based on this ideology
 james praaia: aadhyatmavaad ke, visheshtya hegely aadhyatmavaad ke, kattar virdohi the
 It would not be inappropriate to call him an ideological representative of the usable and outlandish American people
 jab vah satya ke ek aise maapdand ke vichaar main lage the jo aadhyatmavaadi maapdand se sarvatha bhinn ho, unhone janvari, san 1878 i
 ke "paupular science" naamak ek amareeki masikpatr main, charles peers likhit "ham apane vichaaron ko spasht kaise banaaen" - lekh padhaa or usamen adhanik falanumey pramanyawad kii moolbhoot ruparekha paakar unhen yah vishwaas ho gaya ki satya yaa satyagyan kii kasuti yahi he
 To Peers, as he himself has stated, both the term "pragmatism" and its expressions of consequentialism were met with the works of the famous philosopher Kant of Germany
 parantu is vichaardhaara kii pracheenta pradarshit karte hue bhi james ne apane ko vishesh rup se peers kaa hi abhaari mana he or unhen darshanajagat main aadhunik falanumeyapramanyawad kaa pravartak kahkar sammanit kiya he
 In any case, James himself is the most notable name in giving this theory strength and fame
 unke likhe hue "manovigyaan ke siddhant", "dharmik anubhav ke vividh rup", "falanumeyapramanyawad", "satya kaa arth" or "nanaatmak vishwa" aadi sabhi prakhyat granth is vichaardhaara kaa samarthan karte hai
 Not only his logical thoughts, but psychological and elemental - all kinds of ideas are clear symbols of the consequentialist tendency
 james ke anusaar "satya un sab baton kaa naam he jo vishwaas ke maarg main, tathaa nishchit nirdishtavy hetuon se bhi, apane aapako shreshth siddh karti hai"
 In short, "truth is only a worthy or appropriate tool of the thought process, just as" auspicious "is only a successful instrument of our practical life; it is somehow beneficial and, in fact, ultimately and all things Keeping in mind is beneficial
 " james satya ko hamaari nijee dharanaon kaa nakad mulya maanate hai, vastugat tathy nahin
 According to them, we create our own truths
 ve bahya vastuon kii pratikriya maatr nahin; kintu hamaare prayojanon ke sadhak hamaare hi vishwaas hote hai
 We tend to believe those beliefs that give us emotional fulfillment or practical success to be true, and vice versa as false
 at: hamaare vishwaason yaa vichaaron kaa satyatv unke fal yaa parinaam dwaara anumey hota he
 It takes time and experience to establish
 jaise jaise hamen kisi vishwaas se vyavhaar main safalataa milti jaati he vaise hi vaise uskaa satyatv bhi badhata jaataa he
 None of our beliefs, as evidenced by our limited experience, has the right to be called absolutely true, even the so-called natural laws of science cannot be called absolutely true
 hamen adhik se adhik yahi kehane kaa adhikaar he ki jahaan tak hamaare ab tak ke anubhavon kaa sabandh he, ve satya siddh hue hai; parantu isse unki shaashvat satyata pramanit nahin hoti
 a complete experience, which is never possible, is expected for complete truth
 at: maanav dwaara pratipaadit koi bhi satya, chaahe vah vaigyanik ho chaahe vah vaigyanik ho chaahe taarkik, purna satya nahin ho saktaa
 Those who often perceive the siddha-satya or principle, are considered to be only a sub-concept of the result
 ve buddhivaadee tarkshastra kii kadi aalochana karte hai or unke nyayavakya aadi siddhanton ko dooshit tehraate hai
 They always consider human ideas to be ideological, not selfless, against the beliefs of rational rationalists
 gyaan ke satyatvasatyatv ke pareekshan kii bhartiya nyaayadarshan kii "pravritisamarthy va pravritivisamvaad" naamak vidhi, jiske anusaar kaary main pravrutt hone par safalataa pradaayak gyaan ko yatharth tathaa vifaltaajanak gyaan ko ayatharth yaa mithyaa mana jaataa he, is falanumeyapramanyawaadee vidhi se milti julati maaloom hoti he
 But, at the same time, the staunch objectivist jurist saying "tadvati tatrakarak jnanam realam" and tadabhavati tatakarak jnanam illusion: "james" seems to be bitterly criticized by Western Western philanthropists
 jis prakaar satyasty vivechan main, usee prakaar maansik prakriyaaon yaa vichaaron kii vyakhya main bhi falanumeyapramanyawaadee hamaari prayojnatmak kriyaaon ko hi pramukh sthaan pradaan karte hai
 According to him, we produce not only our truths but also diverse experiences
 hamaara praathmik athwa, moolbhoot anubhav ek avichhinn dhara jaisaa hota he or ham swaprayojanon evam swaarthon se prerit hokar, vishleshan tathaa chunaav aadi karne kii apni maansik kriyaaon dwaara, uskaa vibhaajan, vibhinn padaarthon tathaa unke parsparik sambandhon ke rup main, kar liya karte he
 Thus, in his psychology and Locke's atomistic psychology, according to which our ideas are considered to be a mechanically stored sequence of initial simple suffixes, there is a fundamental difference
 falanumeyapramanyawaadiyon kii drushti main parmanuwaadi manovigyaan isi naam ke bhautik vigyaan kii nakal he jo vaastaviktaa se dur evam bhraamak he
 There is no scientific consensus among those who accept the consequent holistic method of testing the truthfulness of beliefs or ideas
 phir bhi, yadi kisi tatvagyan ko is vichaardhaara kaa praturup kaha ja saktaa he to vah he pro dyui dwaara samarthit dow shiller kaa "studies in humanism" naamak pustak main pratipaadit tathvik siddhant
 According to this, we always keep creating reality to a large extent and in the true sense, because every and every real thing depends on our knowledge related to it
 koi bhi gyaat padaarth aisa nahin hota jiskaa swaroop hamaare dwaara uske gyaat hone se, vishesh rup se, nirdhaarit evam nirmit na hota ho
 We do not know what altruism is, and nothing can be said about it, of course
 parantu jahaan tak gyaat vaastaviktaa kaa nirmaan karte rahete hai, kyonki prayek tathakthi yatharth vastu hamaare tatsambandhi gyaan par ashrith rahati he
 There is no known substance whose form is not determined and created by us, especially by its being known
 parmaarthiktaa kya he yah ham nahin jaanate or na uske vishay main, nishchay rup se, kuch kaha hi ja saktaa he
 But as far as known reality is concerned, it is decided that its form of creation depends, in a very important part, on our knowledge and on our knowledge on which our motives and interests are imprinted
 hamaare tathy ve hi hote hai jinamein unki nirmaapika main hamaari ichchhaaon ko trupt karne kii shakti yaa yogyata hoti he
 Just as truths are our successful beliefs, facts are the material that give satisfaction to our desires
 sankshep main hamaare vyaavhaarik jivan main safal kriyaatmak prabhavotpaadakta ko hi, in vichaarkon ke anusaar, tathyata yaa vaastaviktaa kaa lakshan samajhnaa chahie
 Indian Buddhist philosophy's definition of satta, according to which "satya is that which has the potential to produce an action", seems to be compatible with the consequentialist ideology, because it also contains the functions of the objects in determining their existence, existence, existence
 The fruit itself is considered to be decisive
 parantu tatvagyan sambandhi anek anya baton main sabhi buddha darshanik na to aapas main sahamat hai or na aadhunik falanumeyapramanyawaadiyon ke saath
 Purposeism, being a humanist philosophy, does not consider the world and its objects and actions as seriously as it does considering its usefulness in human life
 ek swatantra darshan ke rup main apane astitv kii raksha ke liye prayojanavaad ne maanav ko aadhaar banaate hue sansar evam uski kriyaaon ke kaarnon par vichaar karte hue nimnlikhit mul siddhanton kaa pratipaadan kiya he- Therefore, it is clear that the Purists sometimes support the idealists and sometimes the naturalists
 is prakaar ve apane ko in donon ‘vaado’ ke bich kii sthiti main rakhte hai
 Purposeful philosophy emerged as a movement of 'progress progress education', but today many doubts are being raised regarding its success
 kaaran spasht he ki prayojanavaad ne apane anishchit uddeshyon se, saadhan ko saadhy se adhik mahatv dekar tathaa manushya kii mulyon ke kshetra main rachanaatmakataa ityadi siddhanton kaa pratipaadan karke apurna vichaardhaara hone kaa parichay diya he
 Some points to consider in relation to Purposeful philosophy are as follows - komal shiksha pranali ke kaaran baalkon ko vaastavik jivan jeene ke liye taiyaar nahin kiya jaataa
 They are kept in an artificial world

 There are three methods of showing the scale on the map - kathanamak vadh Different viewer method iii) aalekhi yaa raikhik vidhi In this method, the scale is measured by speaking or saying words such as 1

 The Brahmins who performed the sacrificial fire were called Brahmins, in which the sage, the creator of the mantras, received the position
 raja or uske bhai bete kshatriya kehalaate the
 The rest were called Arya Vish, which means ordinary people
 kya gram kaa mukhiya or kya kisaan, kya sainik or kya gwaala, kya badhai or kya julaha sab isi vish varg main maane jate the
 All the gotras of Brahmins found today are the branch of the seven original lineages of the Vedic period
 ye saat vansh bhargav, angiras, aatreya, kaashyap, vasishtha, agastya or kowshik hai
 The oldest among them are Bhargava, Atreya and Kashyapa, whose promoters were the sages named Bhrigu, Atri and Kashyapa, who originated at the beginning of the Vedic age and were contemporaries of Vaivasvata Manu
 mahirsh bhrigu agni kriya ke pravartak hone ke kaaran atharvan or angiras bhi kehalaate the
 That is why their descendants were initially famous by both the names Bhargava and Angiras
 parantu kuch samay baad bhriguvansh kii ek shakha ne angiras naam se ek swatantra vansh kaa rup dhaaran kar liya at: shesh bhargavon ne apane ko angiras kahana band kar diya
 Thus the Angiras dynasty emerged as the fourth Brahmin dynasty
 kuch shatabdiyon baad basishth naamak ek rishi ne vaasishth vansh kaa pravartan kiya
 Vasistha's brother Agastya enforced the Agastya dynasty
 inhen donon ke samakaleen vishwamitra the jo pehle raajputr the
 He became a Brahmin and introduced a new dynasty called Kaushik in the name of his grandfather Kushik
 ye saaton vansh bahya vivaahi the arthath kisi bhi ek vansh kaa purush usee vansh kii kanya se vivaah nahin kar saktaa tha
 Later, due to increase in the number of Bhargavas and Agarsas, both of them descended into two gana
 baad main in donon vanshon main se prayek main kuch kshatriya simmalit ho gayi
 From time to time four Kshatriyas joined the Bhargavas and five Kshatriyas joined the Angiras
 at: bhargavon main chha: gana or angirson main saat gana ho gayi
 The remaining five dynasties also later came to be known as Gana
 is prakaar brahmanon main attharah gana ho gayi
 Each gana became married, meaning that a person of one gana could marry in a different gana than himself

 Among his descendants were Bhrigu Varun, who had two sons, Chyavan and Kavi

 The Bhargava dynasty was initially divided into two ganas, one of them named Apnavan after the descendant of Gana Chyavan, and the other named Shounak after his descendant Shunak
 bhargavon ke kshatriya mul ke ganon main sabase pracheen vah gana he jiskaa naam vainya athwa pathry he
 In the early centuries of the Vedic period there was a very famous king named Prithu whose father's name was Ven
 is raja kaa koi vanshaj purohit banakar bhargavon main simmalit ho gaya or uske vanshajon kaa ek pruthak gana ho gaya jo vainya athwa pathry kahalaane laga
 Shukracharya is called a poet

 Second kshatriya jo bhargav vansh main simmalit hua vah raja divodas kaa putr mithrayu tha
 Mitrayu's Banshaj is called Maitreya and he was introduced to Maitreya Gan
 bhargavon kaa teesraa kshatriya mul kaa gana vaitahavy athwa yask kehalaata tha
 The Bhargava dynasty was embellished only by Yask

 The fourth Kshatriya origin of the Bhargavas is called Vedavishvajyoti

 In this way, there were six Ganas in the Bhargavas

 Gritsamad's name appears in the thirty-eighth generation of Bhrigu
 gritsamad prasiddh raja dibodas ke samakaleen the
 He was a noted sage and the Sukta of the second division of the Rigveda is composed by him
 gritsamad ke putr kaa naam kurm tha or unheen ke parivaar ke ek rishi kaa naam somahuti tha
 Chyavan was a very famous sage
 unka vivaah raja shayiti kii putree sukanya se hua
 They had two sons, Chywan and Vasan

 Sumedha was married to Nidhrup, grandson of Mahish Kashyap
 apnwaan kaa vivaah raja nahush kii putree or yayati kii bahin ruchi se hua
 The Bhrigu dynasty progressed from Apnavan and Pramati
 pramati ke vansh main ruru naamak rishi hue
 Ruru's descendant Shunak adopted Shaun Hotra Gotri Grutsamad of Angiras dynasty, which resulted in Grutsamad becoming Shaunak and leading to Shaunak Gana
 apnwaan ke vansh main urv nayak prasiddh rishi hue
 Urva's son's name was Ritchik
 richik kaa kanya-kubj raja gadhi kii putree, mahirsh vishwamitra kii bahan, satyavati se vivaah hua
 Richi and Satyavati had a son, Maharish Jamadagni

 Among these six gurus of Bhargavas, the number of members of Apnwan Gana was highest
 at: apnwan gana teen pakshon main vibhajit ho gaya jinke naam vatsa, bid or arshtishen the
 Other groups also came to be called Paksh
 is prakaar bhargavon main aath paksh ho gayi
 Each party was also divided into several gotras
 kabhi-kabhi bhinn bhinn pakshon, ganon athwa vanshon main samaan naam ke gotra bhi mil jate the
 For example, the Gagarya gotra is found in both the Bhargavas and the Agrais
 aisi dasha main yah nishchay karnaa kathin ho jaataa tha ki is prakaar ke gotra vaala manushya kis vansh athwa kis gana kaa sadsy he
 To overcome this confusion, the Pravars were arranged with each gotra
 pravar kaa arth shreshth hota he
 When a person of a gotra also mentions the names of his elders i
e
 superior ancestors, then there can be no confusion
 bhargavon ke aath pakshon ke pravar is prakaar hai
 The elders of the Vatsa Paksha are Bhrigu, Chyavan, Apnavan, Urva and Jagadagni
 vid paksh ke pravar bhrigu, chyavan, apnwaan, urv or bid hai
 The chiefs of the arsenic side are Bhrigu, Chyavan, Apnavan Architishan and Anoop

 The present gotra of the Bhargavas are derived from two ganas
 bats, kuts, gaalav or vid to apnwaan gana ke antargat he
 The remaining two namely Kashyapi and Gagarya are under Yask Gana

 And those who will be other people also reside in Bhrigu region, they all will have Bhargava noun in their respective varnas
 bhagwaan vishnu ne `evamastu ́ kaha
 As a result all the varnas started putting 'bhargava' in front of their names
 aaj bhi bhargav badhai, bhargav sunar, bhargav kshatriya tathaa bhargav vaisya paye jate hai jinke gotra bhinn hai
 Thus in India, Bhriguvanshi Bhargava, Chyavan Vanshi Bhargava, Auvivanshi Bhargava, Vatsavanshi Bhargava, Vidvanshi Bhargava, reside

 In fact, 300 years after the life of Prithviraj Chauhan, he was the only Hindu Emperor of India, who is said to have forgotten a page of history

 He made full use of Hemu's administrative abilities

 hemu ne kisi bhi afgaan adhikari ko uske pad se nahin hataaya isse bhi sainikon main uske prati vishwaas badha
 The caste-based harmony and religious tolerance he introduced during his short reign is a reflection of his uncommon vision
 akbar kii aayu us samay keval 13 varsh thi or bairam khan uskaa sangrakshak or pramukh salaahkaar tha
 Bairam Khan was so hurt and distracted by the defeat of Mughal army in Delhi under Tardi Beg and the victory of Hemu that he hanged Tardi Beg without Akbar's consent
 5 navambar 1556 ko panipat main samraat hemachandra va akbar kii sena main bhayankar yuddh hua
 An arrow pierced the head of Emperor Hemachandra's eye

 Thus, unfortunately, Emperor Hemachandra lost a won battle and the rule of the last Hindu emperor of India, Hemachandra Dhusar Dynasty, ended after 29 days
 bairam khan ke liye yah ghatana ekadam apratyaashit thi
 Bairam Khan prayed to Akbar that he be entitled to the title of 'ghazi' by killing Hemu
 aanan-fanan main achet hemu kaa sir dhad se alag kar diya
 So that the courage of Hemu's supporters or the possibility of future rebellion is completely crushed
 dilli par adhikaar ho jane ke baad bairam khan ne hemu ke sabhi vanshadharon kaa qatleam karne kaa nishchay kiya
 Hemu's supporters, Afghan emirs and feudatories, either died or fled to far-flung destinations
 bairam khan ke nirdesh par uske sipahasaalar moulana pir mohammad khan ne hemu ke pita ko bandi bana liya or talwaar ke waar se unke vruddh sharir ke tukade-tukade kar die

 At the same time, Afghan officials and servants, who are extremely confident of Hemu, are not spared
 apni fatah ke jashn main usne sabhi bandi dhusar bhargavon or sainikon ke kate hue siron se ek vishaal minar banavaai
 When Akbar expressed his fury through a firman, Bairam Khan revolted against Akbar
 akbar ne use haraakar bandi bana liya or use kshamaadaan de diya
 Bairam Khan requested to be sent to Mecca for Haj to atone for his sins, which was accepted by Akbar

 Akbar's spies informed the emperor that except for the women and young children of the Bhargava sect, he had been completely wiped out, only one gray Bhargava was left, his name is Saint Nawaldas! According to Akbar's order, Saint Nawal Das was captured and attended the court and was put in prison

 He ordered the immediate abolition of the tyrannical atrocities on the Dushar Bhargavas and handed over the treasury of the vast area of anodar to Hemantra's deceased nephew Mahipal's four-year-old son Nathmal as the only descendant of Hemachandra and to give 11 thousand currencies annually from the treasury

 The interesting fact is that Hemachandra was unanimously granted the monarchy by his fellow Afghan generals and administrators
 ``vikramaditya ́ ́ kii oopaadhi bhi unhen pradaan kii gai thi, unhone swayan dhaaran nahin kii
 It is also worth noting that folk songs related to Hemachandra are still in circulation in many areas of Bihar
