 Osteoporosis or osteoporosis is a bone disease that increases the risk of fractures
 osteoporosis main asthi khanij ghanatv kam ho jaataa he, asthi sookshm-sanrachana vighatit hoti he or asthi main asangrahit protein kii raashi or vividhta parivartit hoti he
 The World Health Organization has defined osteoporosis in women as the bone mineral density 2
5 standard deviations below the maximum bone mass as measured by DXA; The term "establishment of osteoporosis" also includes the presence of delicate fractures
 osteoporosis, mahilaon main rajonivritti ke baad sarvaadhik saamaanya he, jab use rajonivrittottar osteoporosis kehete hai, par yah purushon main bhi viksit ho saktaa he or yah kisi main bhi vishisht hormone sambandhi vikaar tathaa anya dirghakaalik bimariyon ke kaaran yaa aushadhiyon, vishesh rup se glucocorticoid ke parinamswaroop ho saktaa he, jab is beemaari ko steroid yaa glucocorticoid-prerit osteoporosis kaha jaataa he
 Given its effect, the risk of fragile fracture remains, bone weakness can significantly affect life expectancy and quality of life
 osteoporosis ko jivan-style main parivartan or kabhi-kabhi dawaaiyon se roka ja saktaa he; haddiyon kii kamazori vaale logon ke upachaar main donon shaamil ho sakati hai
 Changing lifestyles include exercising and preventing falls; Medicines include calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonate, and many others
 girane se rokthaam kii salaah main chahalqadami vaali mansapeshiyon ko taanane ke liye vyaayaam, utak-samvedi-sudhaar abhyaas; santulan chikitsa shaamil kii ja sakati hai
 Exercise, with its anabolic effect, can at the same time stop or reverse osteoporosis
 osteoporosis ke sabhi maamalon main antarnihit pranali asthi avasorana or asthi-nirmaan ke bich asantulan he
 The normal bone contains a constant bone reproducibility matrix; At any given point of time, 10% of all bone mass undergoes reproduction
 jaisaa ki 1963 main frost ne pehali baar bataaya, yah prakriya asthi bahukoshikeey ikaayiyon main ghatit hoti he
 Bone is absorbed by osteoblast cells, after which new bone is deposited by osteoblast cells

 The amount of estrogen required to suppress this process is generally lower than the amount expected to stimulate the uterus and mammary gland
 asthi her-pher ke viniman main Î±-rup kaa estrogen receptor bahut mahatvapurn lagata he
 In bone manipulation, calcium metabolism plays an important role in addition to estrogen, and calcium and vitamin d deficiency leads to bone deposition atrophy; Additionally, the parathyroid glands respond to low calcium levels by secreting parathyroid hormone, which increases bone absorption to ensure adequate amounts of calcium in the blood
 asthi nickshepan ko badhaane vaali, thyroid dwaara utpaadit hormone calsitonin kii bhoomika kam spasht he or sambhawatah PTH kii tarah utani mahatvapurn nahin
 Activation of osteoblasts is regulated by various molecular signals, of which RANKL has been the most studied
 yah anu, asthikorak or anya koshikaon dwaara nirmit hota he or RANK ko uttejit karata he
 Osteoprotigerin combines RANKL before it has a chance to bind RANK and therefore suppresses its ability to increase bone absorption
 RANKL, RANK or OPG, tumor parigalan kaarak or uske grahiyon se nikat se jude hue hai
 The role of the Wnt signaling pathway has been accepted, but is poorly understood
 eicosnoid or interlukin ke sthaneey utpaadan ko, asthi her-pher ko niyantrit karne main bhaag lene vaala mana jaataa he or osteoporosis ke vikaas ke mul main in madhyasthon kaa adhik yaa kam utpaadan kaarak ho saktaa he
 The bony bone is the spongy bone located at the end of the long bones and vertebrae
 valkuteey asthi, haddiyon kaa kathor bahari kavach or lambii haddiyon kaa madhya he
 Because osteoblasts and osteoblasts reside on the surface of bones, the ligamentous bone is more active and subject to bone manipulation and regeneration
 na keval asthi ghanatv kam hota he, balki asthi kii sookshm-sanrachana baadhit hoti he
 The ligamentous bone weak bones are dislocated and replaced by weak bones

 These sites are dependent on the asymptomatic bone for strength, and therefore when the reproduction is unbalanced, rapid regeneration leads to weathering of these sites
 osteoporosis kaa apana koi vishesh lakshan nahin he; iskaa mukhya parinaam, asthi bhang kaa vardhit jokhim he
 Osteoporotic fractures occur in conditions where bone is not broken in healthy people in general; Hence they are considered to be fragile fractures
 vishisht najuk asthi-bhang kasheruki stambh, pasli, kuulhe or kalai main hote hai
 Symptoms of spinal cord depression are sudden back pain, often accompanied by nerve root pain and rarely with spinal compression or caudal cavity syndrome
 Multiple vertebral fractures cause long-term pain due to tingling, loss of height, consequent decrease in mobility
 lambii haddiyon ke asthi-bhang gatishiltaa par teevr kshati pahunchaate hai or shalya-chikitsa kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 Hip fractures in particular typically require immediate surgery, as hip fractures are associated with several serious risks such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary angiography and increased death

 Risk factors for osteoporotic fractures can be divided between non-variable and variable
 iske atirikt, aise vishisht rog tathaa vikaar maujuud hai, jinamein osteoporosis ek sweekrut samasya he
 Medication use is theoretically variable, although in many cases the use of drugs that increase the risk of osteoporosis is unavoidable

 There are at least 30 genes associated with the development of osteoporosis
 jin logon ko pehle hi ek fracture hua ho, unhen hamaumr or samalangik kisi vyakti kii tulana main dubaara fracture hone kii sambhaavna duguni hoti he
 Many diseases and disorders have been associated with osteoporosis
 kuch kaa maananaa he ki haddi upaapachay ko prabhavit karne vaali antarnihit vyavastha sidhi he, jabaki dusron ke liye, kaaran kai or agyaat hai
 Some drugs have been linked to increased osteoporosis risk; Classically, only steroids and anticonvulsants are associated, but evidence is emerging regarding other drugs as well
 osteoporosis kaa nidaan asthi khanij ghanatv ko maapne par kiya jaataa he
 Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry is the most popular method

 Depending on the likelihood of the original problem, cancer can be investigated with bone deflections including multi-marrow, Cushing's disease and other factors mentioned above
 dohari urja eks-re avasoranamapi ko osteoporosis ke nidaan ke liye swarna maanak mana jaataa he
 Osteoporosis is diagnosed when the bone mineral density is less than or equal to 2
5 standard deviations of the young adult reference population
 ise T-score kaha jaataa he
 The World Health Organization has established the following guidelines: jab osteoporotic fracture bhi ho, jise ek khadi oonchai se girane kii vajah se ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he, tab shabd "gambhir yaa sthapit" osteoporosis kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The International Committee on Diagnostic Densitometry recognizes that osteoporosis in men under 50 years of age should not be diagnosed on the basis of density measurement criteria alone
 They also state that for pre-menopausal women, a Z-score should be used instead of a T-score, and that osteoporosis should not be diagnosed in such women as well, based on densification criteria alone

 In relation to the screening of men, a cost-analysis study suggests that the investigation "costs in cases of auto-reported pre-fractures in men 65 years of age and without pre-fractures in men 80 years and older" May be less "
 In addition, in middle-to-adult men, a significant reduction in testosterone levels, say less than 300, may be less expensive to detect
 ling ke aadhaar par osteoporosis kaa ilaaj karne ke liye kai dawaaon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Changes in lifestyle are also an aspect of treatment
 upachaar ke liye bisphosphonet mukhya aushadhiy upaay he
 However, in the 1990s, new drugs such as teriparatide and strontium renalate appeared
 pusht osteoporosis maamle main bisphosphonet dawaaen mahilaon ke upachaar-variyata kram main pratham rahi hai
 Commonly included in the prescription are bisphosphonate according to presently sodium alendronate 10 mg per day or 70 mg once a week, risadronate 5 mg per day or 35 mg once a week and or ibandronate once a month
 2007 nirmaataa-samarthit ek adhyayan kaa bataaya ki kam-prabhaav kulha asthi-bhang se peedit rogiyon main, 5 mg zoladronic amla ke vaarshik aadhaan ne kisi bhi fracture ke khatre ko 35% tak, kasheruki fracture ke khatre ko 3
8% se 1
7% tak or gaiyr-kasheruki fracture ke jokhim ko 10
7% se 7
6% tak kam kiya he
 The study also found mortality benefit after 1
9 years: 9
6% of the study group died due to any cause, indicating 28% mortality benefit
 maukhik bisphosphonet apekshaakrit kam avashoshit hote hai or isliye inhen khaali pet lenaa chahie, jahaan agle 30 minute tak koi bhojan yaa peya naa liya jaae

 Although intermittent doses with intravenous prescriptions such as zolendronate prevent oral tolerance problems, these factors are predominantly involved in a rare but unpleasant oral disease called mandibular osteonecrosis
 is kaaran se, maukhik bisphosphonet chikitsa ko sambhawatah tarjeeh di jaani chahie or ab doctor yah anushansa karte hai ki upachaar se purv hi koi bhi upachaaratmak danta kaary kar lenaa chahie
 Recently, teriparatide has been found to be effective against osteoporosis
 yah paratharid hormone kii tarah kaam karata he or asthikorak uttejit karata he or is prakaar unki gatividhi badhati he
 It is used mostly for patients with osteoporosis, especially those with low BMD or multiple fracture risk factors, or who cannot tolerate oral biophosphonates
 yah kalam jaise ek injection upkaran ke istemaal ke saath dainik injection ke rup main diya jaataa he
 In some countries, teriparatide can be used for treatment only if biophosphonates fail or are prohibited
 purv vikiran chikitsa yaa paget rog vaale mariz yaa yuva marijon ko is dawa se bachanaa chahie
 Oral strontium renalate is an alternative oral treatment, which belongs to a class of drugs that its manufacturer has named "dual action bone agents"
 isane vishesh rup se kasheruki fracture ke nivaaran main apni kshamta sabit kar di he
 Laboratory experiments noted that strontium renalate promotes the proliferation of osteoblasts, as well as restricts the proliferation of osteoblasts
 stronsium rinlate ko har rose 2g maukhik nilamban ke rup main liya jaataa he or kasheruki or hip fracture ko rokane ke liye haddiyon kii kamajori ke upachaar hetu ise license di gai he
 Strongium renlate has a side effect effect compared to bisphosphonate, as it does not produce any type of upper GI adjunctive effect, which is the most common reason for drug withdrawal in osteoporosis
 adhyayanon main shiraparak ghanasrashalyata ke jokhim main thodi-si vruddhi note kii gai, jiske kaaran kaa nirdhaaran nahin kiya gaya he
 This suggests that it may be less appropriate in patients with thrombosis risk for different reasons

 haalanki stronsium rinlate prabhavi he, par sanyukt rajya america main abhi tak iskaa upyog sweekrut nahin hua he
 However, strontium citrate is available from many well-known vitamin manufacturers in the US
 adhikansh shodhakartaaon kaa maananaa he ki stronsium bhale hi kisi rup main prayukt ho, vah surakshit or prabhavi he
 The Rheinlet type is only a tool invented by the French Servier Company to patent its version of strontium
 strontium, chaahe uskaa koi bhi rup ho, pani main ghulne yogya or udar amla main ynit hona chahie
 stronsium ko tab antra nalee se rakt pravaah main vahan ke liye protein-baddh kiya jaataa he
 Unlike drugs such as sodium alendronate, strontium does not inhibit bone reorientation and, in fact, can produce stronger bones
 adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki paanch saal ke baad alendronet asthi kshay kaa kaarak bhi ho saktaa he, jabaki stronsium jivan-kaal ke dauraan prayukti se haddi kaa nirmaan jari rakhata he
 Strontium should not be taken with diet or calcium-rich dishes, as calcium competes with strontium during levitation
 phir bhi, yah zaruri he ki har rose calcium, magnesium or chikitsiya maatra main vitamin di lenaa chahie, lekin stronsium lete samay main nahin
 stronsium ko raat main khaali pet lenaa chahie
 Estrogen replacement treatment is a good treatment for the prevention of osteoporosis, but at this time, unless other indications for its use are available, it is not recommended
 mahilaon main rajonivritti ke baad pehle dashak main estrogen kii sifaarish ke bare main anischitata or vivaad maujuud hai
 Bone quantity and quality have been shown to improve with testosterone in men with hypogonadism, but, as of 2008, there have been no studies of the effect with fracture or a normal level on testosterone in men
 SERM dawaaon kaa ek varg he, jo puure sharir main estrogen grahiyon par ek chaynaatmak tareeke se kaam karte hai
 Generally, bone mineral density is controlled by an equilibrium between osteoblasts and osteoclast activity in the trabecular bone
 estrogen kii asthi gathan-avasorana santulan ke niyaman main pramukh bhoomika he, kyonki yah asthikorak gatividhiyon ko badhaava detaa he
 Some serms, such as raloxifene, have effects on the bones, slowing bone absorption by osteoclasts
 naidanik pareekshanon main SERM ko prabhavi sabit kiya gaya he
 Calcium is needed for bone growth, bone healing and bone strength and is an aspect of bone weakness treatment

 In contrast, despite previous reports of elevated high lipoprotein density in calcium supplements, a possible increase in the rate was found
 yadi pushti ho, yah sanket detaa he ki fracture ke kam jokhim vaali mahilaon main calcium kii poorakta se achche se zyada nuksaan hi ho saktaa he
 Some studies have shown that an overdose of vitamin d reduces bone fractures in the elderly, although the Women's Health Initiative found that although calcium and vitamin d increased bone density by 1%, it increased hip bone -did not affect the atrophy, but increased the formation of kidney stones by 17%
 kai adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki airobics, bhaar sahan or pratirodh abhyaas sabhi rajonivrutottar mahilaon main BMD ko banaae rakh sakate hai yaa badha sakate hai
 Many researchers have tried to indicate which exercises are most effective in improving BMD and other metrics of bone quality, but results have varied

 saanchaa:comics infobox sec / formcatsazca:comics infobox sec / genrecat v for Vendetta's is a ten-volume series of comic books written by Alan Moored by and interpreted by David Lloyd, depicting the ill-fated fantasy of the United Kingdom from the 1990s through the 1980s
 ek rahasyamay krantikari jo apane aapako "ve" kahata he, adhinayakawadi sarkaar ko tabah kar dene ke liye kaam karata he or unalogon ko buree tarah prabhavit karata he jinase uskaa saamana hota he
 The series depicts a near-future picture of Britain after a limited nuclear war that devastated much of the world
 is bhavishya main, "norsafaire" naamak ek fasivadi party sattarudh shakti ke rup main ubhar kar saamne aati he
 "V", an anarchist revolutionary disguised as a cow fox, begins a massive, violent, and dramatic campaign to topple the government
 2006 main warner bros ne is par aadhaarit ek film release kii
 The first episode of v for Vendetta was originally published in black and white between 1982 and 1985 by Quality Comics in the British comic compilation titled Warrior
 warrior ke 26 ankon ke prakaashan ke dauraan ve for vendetta ke liye kai covers vishesh rup se feechar kiye gaye; jinamein cartoon strips us sheershak main sarvaadhik lokapriy ho gaye
 When publishers canceled Warrior in 1985, several companies tried to convince Moore and Lloyd to publish them and complete the story
 1988 main di si comics ne das khandon main series prakashit kii jisane warrior kii kahaniyon ko rangeen chitron main punah mudrit kiya gaya, tab jaakar yah series apni purnataa tak lagaatar jari rahaa
 The first new material came in issue # 7, which contained unreleased episodes that were to be published in Warrior's # 27 and # 28
 tony vier ne ek adhyay kaa chitrankan kiya tathaa anya do main main apni atirikt kala kaa yogadan diya; steve wheetekar evam siobhan dodds ne puri series main rang bharne vaale chitrakaar ke rup main kaam kiya
 The series, which also featured an Moore's article "behind the Painted Smile" and included two "timeouts" that diverged from a continuation of the central narrative, later appeared in the shape of a collection printed in a commercial paper back, called the United States
 Published by DC Vertigo and printed by Titan Books in the United Kingdom
 warrior main ve for vendetta ke liye david loyad kii kalakriti multah kaale or safed main hi ai thi
 The DC Comics edition published the artwork in pastel color only
 loyad ne kaha he ki unki hameshaa se hi kalakriti ko rangeen prakashit karne kii ichha rahi he or aarthik kaarnon se hi aarambhik prakashnon ko kaale or safed main hi chhapakar prakashit karnaa padaa kyonki rangeen karne se kharch kuch zyada hi pad jaataa 
 In writing for v for Vendetta, Moore had the idea to write a comics series titled The Doll, which he assigned to DC Thomson at 22 years old
 "bihaind da painted smil" main moore ne is baat kaa khulaasa kiya he ki is vichaar ko khaarij kar diya gaya kyonki disi thomson ne "parlangik aatankwaadi" kahkar is vichaar par etraj jataayaa
 varshon baad, warrior ke sampadak days skin ne gahari rahasyamayi kaali shrinkhalaa kaa david loyad jaise kalakaar ke saath srijan karne ke liye kathith taur par moore ko aamantrit kiya
 
 He actually asked David Lloyd to recreate something similar to his popular UK knight-raven series, a mysterious mask posed in the posh United States in the 1930s
 loyad ne lekhak alan moore ko apane saath milakar kaam karne kii peshkash kii or unki baatcheet ke madhyam se samaayojan ke vikaas se,1930 ke dashakon ke sanyukt rajya ko nikat bhavishya ke britain main gatiman ho sakenge
 As the adjustment progressed, the character also continued to develop; Once the idea of the "real" kingpin version of knight-raven was sprung to mind, he first became a rebel cop against the totalitarian state he was once an anarchist hero
 moore or loyad donon ne milakar 1960 ke british comic dashak ke charitron se prabhavit hokar andhere vaale saahasik karnaamon kii shrinkhalaa kii kalpana kii, saath hi saath nite reven se prabhavit hokar ek marwel yu
ke kii shrinkhalaa kii avadharana man main ai, jisapar loyad bahut pehle hi lekhak steve parksouse ke saath kaam kar chuke the
 At lunch, editor Days Skin brought up the name v for Vendetta with his colleague Grouham Marsh, with more emphasis on the "V" than the "vendetta" - but it was quickly dismissed because of hearing It looked very Italian
 phir ve for vendetta naam ubhara, jisamen "vendetta" kii bajaay "ve" par adhik jor diya gaya tha
 David Lloyd developed the idea to decorate v in Guy Fox's costume after the traditional superhero look in earlier designs
 kahani taiyaar karte samay moore ne un baton kii ek suchi banaai, jinhen ve patakatha main laana chaahate the or unhone ise "bihaind da painted smil" main punah prastut kiya

 Meanwhile, v sends a comment to AV that he has not yet reached the destination of "the Land of do-as-you-please" as the final result he wants - "the Land of Take" Instead of the chaos of "what-you-want" - for an interim period they really want to follow the system of redundancy: a voluntary organized society

 is

 Dominic, whose head is attacked by a stone and runs for safety, becomes unconscious, his final conscious picture is hidden in the veil of AV V

 In Shadow Gallery, Dominic returns to his senses, meaning that Evie wants to train him as his successor

 chaar darjan kaidiyon jinhen bataur prayog ke batch 5 naam ke pituarin / pinarin yogic ke injection die gaye unamem ek maatr uttarajive he
 This compound led to widespread vascular anomalies that eventually killed all the prisoners except V, with many believing that it increased strength, reflexes, endurance, and ability to endure pain, although the book did not mention this
 There is no confirmation of any kind; v maintains that he is only a human being
 haalanki dow sarrij kaa maananaa he ki injection ne ve ko veikshipt bana diya tha, is baat kii sambhaavna he ki paagalpan ke bahaane hi aazaadee kii disha main pehla kadam rakhane ke liye rasta saafe ho gaya tha
 Throughout the novel, v is almost always wearing his trademark Guy Fawkes mask, shoulder-length dark gray hair and black gloves, tunic, trousers and boot boots
 jab vah nakaab pahane nahin rahata he, uskaa cheharaa nahin dikhaaya jaataa he
 When he is out of the shadow gallery, he is wearing this cloak of about 1600s in conical hats and a cloak of forgettable length to the floor
 uske pasandida hathiyaron main khanjar, visphotak evam ashru gas shaamil hai
 The book suggests that v derives its name from the Roman numeral "V", the number of the room in which he was kept during the experiment
 uske naam kii utpatti kii yahi moulik vyakhya he
 However, other theories can also explain the origin of his name
 udhaaharan ke liye, dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan mitrarashtron ke sangharshon ke samarthan main yojit reliyon main dhruviya shaktiyon par kaabo paane ke liye winston churchill ke naaron "ve for victory" kii pratidhwani se pratyutpann bhi uskaa naam mana ja saktaa he
 It simply adapted into the simple "V for Vendetta"
 is baat par bhi gaur kiya janaa chahie ki ek vrutt ke andar v ekmaatr araajaktaa kii uthal puthal kaa pratik he jisamen tiryak rekha a kaa pratik k bana detii he
 At the end of the book, v gives Chief Inspector Eric Finch a chance to shoot him and dies in Evie's arms
 avi ko tab ve kii pahchaan ho jaati he or tab mul ve ko bam se ladi train main ek viking antim sanskaar ke liye sula detii he jiskaa antim gantavy downing street he
 v is the only character whose speech sounds "distorted and distorted", not completely elliptical, possibly because the mask distorts his voice
 alan mur kii ek or kriti wochaman main,rorshtch kaa charitra bhi mukhauta pahane rahata he or vah bhi jab mukhauta pahana hota he thik isi prakaar vikrut bhaashan ke bulbule paidaa karata he or jab nahin pahane hota tab aisa kuch bhi nahin hota he
 Whenever v quotes another author, the quotation marks are clearly visible
 ve ek jawan ladki avi hamond kii jo kahani kii pramukh paatr he, "fingermen" se raksha karata he
 She is cast into the crew of V, learns from her past, struggles against the current government and eventually becomes her successor, as well as a future heir to Dominic Stone, partner of Chief Inspector Eric Finch

 He is completely honorable and civilized, and the leader trusts him because he is reliable and has no ambition
 vah apni taarkik lakshanik buddhi evam atmagyaan praapt karata he, norsafaire main apni mileebhagat se kiye gaye atyaachaar par dukh vyakt karata he; jo bhi ho yah vahi he jo ve kii hatya karata he
 In one place he is mentioned as Edward Finch
 finch kahani ke samanaantar ve ke mukhya virdohi ke rup main kaary karata he, agar ve ko khalanaayak maanakar chalaa jaay to yahi kahani kaa nayak kahalaayegaa
 Adam Suzanne, also known as "the Leader", is the top leader of the Norsefire Party and serves as the country's head of government, although his power is largely formal
 suzan ko phet computer pranali ke prati pyaar he or apane maanav sahyogiyon se bhi adhik iskaa sahyary pasand karte hai
 Suzanne, as her own mind is not in control, expresses her egoistic belief that only she and God exist in existence
 unhen fasiwad or "pavitrataa" kii naslvaadi dharna se lagaav he or vaastavik rup se yah maanate hai ki naagarik adhikaar ghaatak or anaavashyak hai
 He truly cared about his people, although it is implied that he embraced fascism as a reaction to his loneliness
 Prior to the war, he was a Chief Constable with religious convictions
 upanyaas ke ant main, unki apane hi bhootpurv leftinet kii vidhwaa rose olemond dwaara hatya kar di jaati he
 In filming, he is renamed "adam Sutler" and is murdered by Peter Creedie

 prishthbhumiyon ke falak aksar sanket shabdon or laal machhliyon se bhare hote hai; jiname saahitiyik sanketon evam shabdon se khilwaad adhyay ke sanketon tathaa ve ke vaktavyon main saaf -saaf jaahir he

 Another cultural context is highlighted in the predominantly theatrical adaptation of "remember Remember November 5, Remember Land Treason and Conspiracy"
 mujhe iskaa koi kaaran samaj main nahin aata ki barudi deshadroh ko kaise kabhi bhulaayaa ja saktaa he
 "these lines incidentally repeatedly hint at the story of Guy Fawkes and his involvement in the landmines of 1605
 is kahani main araajaktaa or fasiwad ke do paraspar virdohi raajnneetik drushtikon ek duusare kaa khandan karte hai
 Every aspect of Fascist ideology is seen to be involved in the reign of Norsefire: it is a completely unknown Bheeru, who rules the country through fear and force, and leads the powerful leadership
 jaisaaki adhikansh fasivadi shasankalon main, kai rajya sanghathan hua karte hai jo satta ke sangharsh main ek duusare ke saath bhide rahete hai jabaki ek hi netaa kii ajna kaa paalan karte hai
 Fascist rule fully supports collective federalism
 samuhik sanghavaad kaa ek mahatvapurn pahalu samaaj kii rajya ke saath pahchaan kaayam karnaa he, or samaaj ko ek sharir ke rup main maanakar chalaa jaay to rajya ke vibhinn santhaan usame sharir ke vibhinn avyav maane jaaenge
 yah un sansthaaon ke dwaara pratibimbit hote hai jinke naam sharir ke angon ke naam par rakhe gaye hai : police kii guptchar shakhaaka naam da noj he; da year evam }da ai { / 1 nigaraanee sanghathanon ke naam hai, police kii vardi shakha {1}da finger he ; kaha jaataa he) or rajya dwaara niyantrit media da mouth ke rup main jaani jaati he
 In devising this system of control, Moore provoked classical English political thinking in a provocative manner, notable in Thomas 'hobbes' Leviathan, which envisioned establishment with state legitimacy as a giant company, Gestalt
 The need was to maintain and prevent indiscriminate violence
 prabhusatta ne samaaj ke prakritik 'pramukh' kaa gathan kiya, jo shaayad rajya sarkaar ke vibhinn angon ke sanrachanaatmak gathan kii vyakhya karata he
 To keep this body healthy, the fascist ideology prescribes the cleanliness of these unhealthy elements, thus, totalitarianism and concentration camps

 Dolphus and Schuschnigg]) in Austria under the reign 1933-38; Such civilizations have taken shape, particularly in England, where, in fact, the Church of England has been 'established' under the queen and head of state
 isse yah spasht he ki kyon, kahani kii nirantarata main, hinsak virodh main gaiyr norsafaire vidrohiyon ne united kingdom ke gaiyr angarezihisse kaa parigrahan kar liya he v himself remains something like a puzzle whose history is only indicated
 kahani kaa adhikansh duusare charitron ke drushtikon se kaha gaya he: jinamein ve ke prashansak or prashikshu avi, solah varshiya factory majdoor, erik finch, duniya bhar kii thakaan liye hue vyaavhaarik police jo ve kii talash main lagi hui he, evam party ke antargat fasivadi party ke andar hi satta ke anya anek daavedaar hai
 V's destructive activities are morally ambiguous and a central theme of this series is the rationalization of atrocities in the name of lofty goals, whether stability or freedom
 The character is actually an anachronistic traditional clichÃ©d stereotypical mix as an advocate of anarchy and a terrorist
 moore ne ek saakshaatkaar main kaha: The main question is whether this young man is right? Or is she crazy? Do you, the reader, think about this? Which flashed in my mind as an anarchist solution in the proper way
 i did not want to tell people what to think and of course some of these small aspects should be considered, which has always been a clear iteration in the history of the entire human race
 moore ne kabhi bhi yah saafe-saafe jaahir nahin kiya ki ve kathith rup se koun he, keval itnaa hi vivaran diya ki ve avi kaa pita v vislar kii maa, athwa charlie kii chachee nahin he"; unhone baar-baar yah spashtikaran kiya he ki ve kii pahchaan kahani main kabhi bhi ujagar nahin kii gai he
 The ambiguity of V's character is a continued subject matter through the work; It is left to the readers to decide for themselves whether v is healthy or a psychopath, hero or villain
 Before wearing the mask of Guy Fawkes, Ivy comes to the conclusion that V's identity is negligible compared to her paid roles
 Because his identity is a true symbol of ideas in itself
 ek nishchit pahchaan ke madhyam se maanvikaran kii is kami se yah anumaanit he ki prayek vyakti main is charitra kii sristi puri pustak se avdhaarit vyaktigat uttardaayitv ke udhaaharan swaroop kii gai he
 In "everyman" this character is later depicted as a young, insecure illiterate person who gradually grows into "V" through AV

 According to David, Moore proposed to him the idea of composing music that would serve as a set of preface songs from the second volume of the novel

 Alan Moore, however, distanced himself from the film, as his work with the filming of the film's adaptation was entirely timely
 unhone DC comics ke prakaashak apana sahyog samaapt kar diya, jab iske pradhan corparate warner bros ne movie ke paksh main mur ke sambhavit samarthan ke bayaan ko waapas lene main vifal rahe, inkaar kar diya
 Moore's response was by reading the screenplay: " bush-yug kii lokkatha kii or logon dwaara mode di gai he taaki raajnneetik vyangy ke madhyam se apane hi desh main logon ko darpok banaaya ja sake


 yah kuch vyapak rup se napusank or kunthit america udaarvaad kii fanthasi thi jo america udaaravaadi mulyon ke khilaaf us rajya ke nav dakiyanoosiyon ke khilaaf khadi kii gai thi- jo ve for vendata ke hasya ke laayak nahin tha

 The film logically changed the original message, turning "V" into a freedom fighter and not an anarchist

 The axis of the rotational frame taken in it is connected to that body and is parallel to the main inertia axes of the body

 The general form of Euler equations is the following- jahaan m lagaaye gayi balaghurna hai, i jadtwaghurna matrix he, Ï mukhya akshon ke saapeksh koniya veg he
 The above equations in 3D main perpendicular axes form the following: jahaan Mk aropit balaghurna m ke ghatak hai, Ik mukhya jadtv aghurna aksh i ke ghatak hai or Ïk koniya veg Ï ke ghatak mukhya akshon kii disha hai
 Starting with the second law of Eiler, in an inertial reference system, the angular momentum l has a differential differential equal to the charged fault relative to time
 jahaan Iin jadtviya nirdesh tantra main pariklit jadtwaghurna pradeesh he
 Although this rule is universally true, it is not always helpful to solve for the speed of a normal rotational hard body
 chunki Iin or Ï donon gati ke dauraan parivartit ho sakate hai
 Therefore, we change the direction of the system in such a way that it remains constant along the rotational body and selects such that its axes are located in the direction of inertial direction
 is nirdesh tantra main kam se kam jadtwaghurna pradeesh to niyat he, jo gananaa ko sugam banaata he
 As explained in the inertia, angular momentum jahaan Mk, Ik or Ïk upar varnit kiye gayi anusaar hai
 In the rotational reference system, the time differential is se pratisthapit karnaa chaiye
 Where the following "rot" is representing the rotational instruction system

 saamne ke chitra main r trigya, m dravyaman evam i jadtwaghurna vaali ek billiard kii gend ko teble ke samaantar is prakaar maarna he ki gend teble par bina sarake hue aage bade 
 In this we want to know at what height f from the base of the ball is applied so that there is no friction force, the ball moves forward without slipping, rolling
 kshaitij disha main lagaaye gayi bal f kaa balaghurna m = - f gend main ghurni twaran paidaa karata he- The fault negative is taken here because it is opposite to the rotation angle Ï
 is sameekaran ke alaava, gend par lagaaye gayi bal f ke kaaran uske dravyaman kendra main twaran utpann hot he
 Therefore dhyaan dijiye ki twaran x Ì { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}}}, teble ke samaantar tathaa bal kii disha main he
 To roll without slipping it is necessary to- is prakaar uparokt sabhi sameekaran milakar gend kii gati kaa teen charon h, Ï, tathaa x main varnan karte hai
 Solving these equations together, we get the following information: kisi thos, samang gole kaa jadtwaghurna i = 2 5 m r 2 { \ displaystyle I={ \ tfrac {2}{5}}mr^{2}} hota he
 Keeping this value- r trigya, m dravyaman tathaa i jadtwaghurna vaala ek pahiyaa Î± kone par jhuke hue samtal par gurutveey twaran g ke prabh se lotni gati kar rahaa he
 
 chunki yah pahiyaa sthaanantarit bhi ho rahaa he, iske dravyaman kaa raikhik twaran bhi ho rahaa he
 In this problem we are assuming that the speed of the wheel is slipping
 atah nat-samtal or pahiye ke bich ek gharshan bal r utpann hota he jo pahiye ko ghumata he, kyonki is bal ke kaaran ek balaghurna m = -r r lagata he
 This force is taken negative because it is opposite to the rotation angle Ï
 atah pahiye kii ghurnan gati kaa sameekaran nimnlikhit he- Now consider the displacement of the wheel's center of mass
 pahiye ke dravyaman mg kaa nat-samtal kii disha main avyav f kaa maan F=mgsin he
 This force is acting in the opposite direction to the force of friction
 atah newton kii gati ke dwitiya niyam ke anusaar- Where x Ì { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}}} is the parallelogram acceleration of the wheel
 iske alaava, yadi loton gati bina phisale hue ho rahi he to x Ì = â r Ï Ì { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}}=-r{ \ ddot { \ varphi }}} 
 Thus we obtained equations of motion covering three unknown quantities R, Ï and x
 in samikarnon ko hal karne par hame yah praapt hota he- From this it can be seen that for a given side-angle Î±, the maximum acceleration occurs when the mass of the wheel is at most close to its axis
 
 Note that at the same level, if the friction is zero, the acceleration of a body moving on it will be x Ì = g sin â¡ { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}} = g \ sin}, which is the acceleration of the wheel More than

 harman ne san 1814 main sabase pehle anayimit vakr se seemaabaddh kshetra kaa sidhe hi kshetrafal maapne kaa yantra banaaya
 a number of instruments were made after that
 san 1860 main vetali spark ne ek kshetramapi banaaya, jisamen ghurnansheel kshaitij vrittiya mandalak par aalekhak belan viraam kiye rahata he
 This mandala is mounted on a frame, mounted on three curved wheels of rolling wheels on three parallel tracks
 mandalak ke neeche or chaukhate par ek kshaitij chad do jodi nideshak belanon ke bich is prakaar chadhi rahati he ki vah patariyon se lamb disha main chal sake
 The angular circulation is proportional to the longitudinal displacement of the rod by a thin wire wrapped around the axis of the mandrel and tied at the ends of the rod
 jab chad ke ek sire par bandhe anurekhak kii nok us vakr kii parisima par chalati he jiskaa kshetrafal maapna he to mandalak ke kandra or aalekhak pahie ke samtal ke bich kii duuri sadaa vakr kii koti ke samaanupaat main rahati he
 Therefore the number of revolutions of the plotter wheel is the measure of the area fruit
 jacob amslar ne san 1854 ke lagbhag ek dhraviya kshetramapi banaaya, jo apane saral nirmaan or alp mulya ke kaaran bahut prachlit ho gaya
 Approximately the same basis of 1875, the instrument Stanley made, in which the India-oriented points are fixed and the tracer moves on the given curve
 anshaankit belan par aarambh ke or ant ke paathyaankon ke antar se anurekhak bahu kii lambaai ke anusaar kshetrafal gyaat ho jaataa he
 In 1856, Amsler invented the massometer widely known as integrator
 is upkaranika se kshetrafal ke atirikt aksh r

 Although most of the analysis in these fields is done by numerical procedures, to some extent procedural analysts are also used
 prasanvaadi vishleshan siddhant main yah siddh kiya gaya he ki samuchit pratibandhon sahit aavart falan pha kaa nirupan nimnaankit shrenee dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 The purpose of the procedural analyzer is to determine these coefficients a and b with a simple and quick method

 In addition to physics and engineering, these analysts were of great use in the Second World War for computation of ballistic paths
 avakal vishleshkon main mul praathmik yukti vahi mandalak or pahiyaa samakalak vaali he jo aarambh ke kshetramapiyon main prayukt hui thi
 Its function is to integrate = Raya; The integrator has an angular displacement of the zipper, and the integrator is the distance from the center of the wheel and the result is the resulting angular displacement of the integrator wheel
 do raashiyon ya or r kaa yogafal, jinamein se harek isha ke koniya visthaapan se nirupit hota he, ek teesri isha ke ya+r ke baraabar koniya visthaapan se praapt hota he
 In the analysis the constant amount is multiplied by a by proper preparation

 Premchand has created humor in the novel by the context of Bhalchand and Moteram Shastri
 nirmala ke chaaron ore katha-bhawan kaa nirmaan karte hue asambaddh prasangon kaa purnatah bahishkaar kiya gaya he
 With this, this novel has become more structured and well organized than Sevasadan
 ise premachand kaa pratham âyathartwaadeeâ tathaa hindi kaa pratham âmanovaigyanik upanyaasâ kaha ja saktaa he
 One peculiarity of Nirmala is that the omission of 'preacher Premchand' in it has not only made it artistic but has also become an evolution of the craft of Premchand

 However, archaeological excavations have revealed that Agrippa's world shrine was completely destroyed and that perhaps Emperor Hadrian took responsibility for the reconstruction of the world shrine at the site of Agrippa's original temple
 agrippa ke vishwa devalayas kii sanrachana par aksar bahes hoti rahati he
 As a result of excavations in the 19th century, archaeologist Rodolfo Lanciani concludes that Agrippa's world sanctuary was built in such a way that it is open from the south side, in contrast to the present structure it is to the north and the "T

 Cassius Dio, a graeco-roman senator, consul and author of the extensive history of Rome, erroneously credited the vaulted construction of the World Temple to Agrippa rather than Hadrian in his article nearly 75 years after the Reconstruction
 Contemporary writers were the only ones who mentioned the world sanctuary
 200 saal baad bhi, is imaarat ke mul or iske uddeshy ke bare main anischitata bani hui thi: This building was repaired in 202 AD by Septimius Severus and Caracalla, for which there is another small inscription
