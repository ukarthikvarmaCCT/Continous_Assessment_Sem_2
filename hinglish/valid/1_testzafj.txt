 Compared to other materials such as glass or metal, the recycling of plastic polymers requires excessive processing
 plastic main ghulanshiltaa bahut kam hoti he jiskaa kaaran inaki badi polimar shrinkhalaaon kaa ucch aanvik bhaar he

 charan simaaon ke parinamswaroop praapt hone vaale padaarth main sanrachanaatmak kamajori pai jaati he, jiskaa arth he ki polimar mishran keval simit anuprayogon main hi upyogi hai
 Another barrier to recycling is the increased use of dyes, fillers and other chemicals in plastics

 They are often used more for recycling due to less use of chemicals in soft drink cartons and plastic bags
 jaivik rup se apaghatit hone vaale plastic ke upyog main vruddhi ho rahi he
 If some of these products are mixed with other plastic products for recycling, the plastic obtained from it cannot be recycled due to differences in properties and melting point
 ricycling se pehle, plastic utpaadon ko unke rezin pahchaan code ke anusaar alag kiya jaataa he, yah polimar kii kismon ko shreneebaddh karne kii vidhi he, jise 1988 main plastic udyog sanstha dwaara viksit kiya gaya tha
 For example, polyethylene terephthalate, commonly called PET, has a resin code 1

 After that the plastic recyclables are cut into small pieces

 Similarly, agricultural plastic products such as mulch film, drip tape and silage bags are being released from waste sources and are successfully recycled to make industrial application products, such as plastic composite railroad ties
 Historically, these agricultural plastic products were formerly suppressed in the ground or burnt in a particular individual's field

 Plastic recycling rates are much lower than other items such as newspapers and corrugated fiber boards
 2005 main sabhi plastic kii botalon kii ricycling dar 24% thi
 The recycling rate of plastics received after use has increased every year since 1990
 2006 main plastic kii botalon kii ricycling kii dar 2

 Recycling of PET bottles exceeded 102 million pounds in 2006 compared to 2005
 2005 main echdipii botalon kii ricycling kii sankhya 928 million pound tak bad gai thi
 The national plastics recycling rate is low due to the complexity of sorting and processing, adverse economics, and consumer confusion about the type of plastic to be recycled

 This sign is called a resin identification code
 yah chihn dibbon kii tali par muhar ke rup main lagaaya jaataa he yaa mudrit kiya jaataa he or yah tiron ke ek trikon se ghira hua hota he
 The purpose of these arrows was to make plastic identification easier for recycling
 yah aavashyak nahin he ki ricycling chihn hone se koi vastu residential ricycling kaaryakramon dwaara sweekaar kar lee jaaegi
 In the UK, due to the lack of recycling facilities, the amount of plastic recycled after use is relatively small

 Seven groups of plastic polymers are used for packaging applications worldwide, each of which has distinct characteristics
 Each group's plastic polymer can be identified by its plastic identification mark — often an abbreviation of a number or letter
 udhaaharan ke liye, lo-density poliethylin ko sankhya 4 or / yaa "aldipii / LDPE" aksharon se pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 The PIC is displayed inside a recycling symbol of one to three arrows behind it

 Like in Greece, in England, the play sprouted from religious rituals
 madhyayug main carch kii bhashaa laathini thi or padariyon ke upadesh bhi isi bhashaa main hote the
 Unaware of this language, ordinary people had the facility to explain the stories of the life of the Bible and Jesus using sermons along with preaching
 bade din or easter ke parvon par aise abhinayon kaa vishesh mahatv tha
 It also entertained with religion
 pehle ye abhinay mook hua karte the, lekin naveen shatabdi main laathini bhashaa main cathopakathan hone ke bhi pramaan milte hai
 Later, the lingua franca was also used interchangeably
 angreji bhashaa 1350 main rajbhasha ke rup main sweekrut hui
 Hence, only the lingua franca started being used later
 is prakaar aarambh se hi naatak kaa sambandh janajivan se tha or samay ke saath vah or bhi gaharaa hota gaya
 All these acts were done inside the churches and only the monks, clergy and singers associated with them could participate in them
 naatak ke vikaas ke liye jaruri tha ki use kuch khuli hawa mili
 Circumstances helped him in this
 mistry or mirakil naatak vishesh manoranjak hone ke kaaran in abhinayon ko dekhne ke liye log girjagharon ke bheetar umadane lage
 Forced, the church authorities managed them in the church grounds
 lekin sadakon par yaa bazaar main in abhinayon ke liye anumati na thi
 As soon as they came out of the prayer hall, the appearance of the stories started changing and the trend of cleanliness started increasing in them
 is svachhndatha ne girjaghar ke bheetar ke abhinayon ko bhi prabhavit karnaa aarambh kiya
 Therefore, in addition to the scene of ascension of Jesus, doubts were stopped in the prayer hall and by making acting rules
 bazaaron main or sadakon par aise abhinay karnaa paap ghoshit kar diya gaya
 This control over the clergy and other church servants brought the act out of the church walls
 nagaron kii shreniyon ne is kaam ko apane haath main liya
 This is where the rise of Mystery and Miracle plays
 mistry naatakon main bible kii kathaon se vishay chune jate the or mirakil naatakon main santon kii jivaniyaan hoti thim
 This distinction was evident in France, but there was no distinct difference between the two in England
 14veen shatabdi ke prarambh main naatak mandaliyaan apana saamaan baiylgaadiyon par ladakar abhinay dikhaane ke liye desh bhar main bhraman karne lageen
 It is clear that the scenes in such enactments were almost non-existent
 lekin veshbhusha kaa kaaphi dhyaan rakhaa jaataa tha
 Actors were often temporary and for some time took leave from their permanent occupations and earned both virtue and money by acting in these plays
 dhire-dhire janaruchi ko dhyaan main rakhkar gambhirtha ke bich prahasan khand bhi abhinit hone lage
 Not only this, the characters of Hazrat Noah's wife, Satan, and the cruel Herod began to be rendered humorously
 vibhinn nagaron kii naatak mandaliyon ne apni-apni vishistataaen bhi viksit kin- dharmik shiksha, prahasan, teevr anubhuti or yatharthwaad vibhinn anupaaton main mishrit kiye jane lage
 There is no doubt that these plays had many themes and form defects, but they laid the foundation for the future development of English drama
 is vikaas kaa aglaa kadam tha mistry or mirakil naatakon ke sthaan par morality naatakon kaa udai
 These plays were written for moral education
 in naatakon par madhyayugin sahitya ke bhavvaad or pratik yaa roopak kii style kaa spasht prabhaav he
 In addition to sermons, names of characters were taken from the qualities or fortifications, such as sin, grace, fellowship, env, idylliness, repetition, etc
 in naatakon kii kendriya kathavstu thi maanav kaa paapon dwaara peechha tathaa aatma or gyaan dwaara uskaa uddhaar
 Thus these plays gave rise to the important tradition of depicting the internal conflicts of man
 aise naatakon main sabase prasiddh fa evrimanf he jisaki rachana 15veen shatabdi ke ant main hui
 Morality plays were longer than earlier plays, and due to the renaissance effect, some of them were also divided into numerals and scenes on Seneca plays
 kuch naatak saamanton kii haweliyon main khele jane ke liye bhi likhe jate the
 Most of them were acted by professional actors
 inamen vyaktigat rachana ke lakshan bhi dikhaai padane lage
 Initially the dividing line of morality and interlude plays was very blurred
 bahut se morality naatakon ko interlude sheershak se prakashit kiya jaataa tha
 Elements of farce were also included in morality plays to overcome the boredom born out of blank preaching
 aise hi khandon ko interlude kehete the
 They later became independent of morality plays
 aise naatakon main sabase prasiddh hewood kaa fa for pizaf he
 These plays had elements of modern buffalo and farce
 inamen se kuch ne ben johnson kii yathartwaadee kamedi ke liye bhi jameen taiyaar kii
 Famous humanist thinker Sir Tomas More also wrote such plays
 isi yug main aage aane vaali prahasan or premayukt darbari romentic kamedi ke tatv madwal kii kritiyon fa phulgence and lukrisaf or fa kallysto and melibiaf main or romani pravritiyon se sarvatha mukt kamedi ke tatv udal kii rachana fa ralf rwyster dawysterf or mistar es kii rachana fa gaamar garts nidilf main prakat hue
 Historical plays also took place only then
 16veen shatabdi ke madhya tak aate aate punarjagran ke maanavtawaad ne angreji naatak ko spasht rup se prabhavit karnaa shuru kiya
 By 1581, Seneca translated into English
 saikavil or norton krit angreji kii pehali tragedy fa gorbodak kaa abhinay elizabeth ke saamne 1562 main hua
 Platus and Terence had the deepest impact on the comedy

 There are two clear directions for this development
 ek ore kuch naatakkaar deshaj parampara ke aadhaar par aise naatakon kii rachana kar rahe the jinamein naitikta, hasya, romance ityadi ke vividh tatv mili-jule hote the
 On the other hand, under the influence of Latin dramatics, scholarly playwrights were trying to establish purism in comedy and tragedy
 angreji naatak ke swarnyug ke pehle hi anek naatakakaron ne in donon tatwon ko mila diya or unheen ke samanvay se shakespeare or uske anek samakalinon ke mahaan naatakon kii rachana hui
 One thing was lacking in the preparations before the golden age of this golden age
 vah 1576 main shordich main pratham saarvajanik rangashaala kii sthapana se puri hui
 Famous theaters in that era are Theater, Rose, Globe, Fortune and Swan
 saarvajanik rangashalas landan nagar ke baahar hi banaai ja sakati thim
 By the end of the 16th century, only one theater was located in Blackfriars and was called Individual
 saarvajanik rangashaalaon main naatakon kaa abhinay khule aasmaan ke neeche, din main, bhinn-bhinn virgon ke saamaajikon dwaara ghire hue praaia: nagn rangamanch par hota tha
 The plays of the Elizabethan and Stuart era require descriptive passages, excesses of poetry, subject matter, sometimes clumsy jokes or fugitives, bloodshed, contemporary puts, realism, etc
 to understand the elements of these theater and their social attention
 vyaktigat rangashaalaon main rangamanch kaksh ke bheetar hota tha jahaan prakaash, drishy aadi kaa acha prabandh rahata tha or uske saamaajik abhijaat hote the
 They also influenced the form of English drama in the 17th century
 in rangashaalaon ne naatakon ke liye keval vyapak ruchi hi nahin paidaa kii balki naatakon kii kathavstu or rachana vidhaan ko bhi prabhavit kiya, kyonki is yug ke naatakakaron kaa rangamanch se jivit sambandh tha or ve uski sambhaavnaaon or simaaon ko drushti main rakhkar hi naatak likhte the
 The era of Elizabeth was the culmination of national unity, indomitable enthusiasm, humanistic awareness and great efforts in British history
 iskaa prabhaav sahitya kii anya vidhaon kii tarah naatak par bhi padaa
 Shakespeare is the greatest literary gift of that era to the world, but apart from that it is the work of many great talents
 us mahaan yug kii bhoomika taiyaar karne main vishvavidhyalayon main shikshit hone or lekhan ko vyavsaay banane ke kaaran fa uniwarsity vitsaf kahalaane vaale robert green, jon lily, thomas kid or christopher marlo kaa visheshat: bahut bada haath he
 Green and Lily gave way to love love and generous farce, Kidd repulsive Tragedy and Marlow's tragedy of asymmetry borne of conflict of ambition and morality
 laathini or deshaj paramparaon ke mishran se unhone naatak ko kalaatmakataa di
 George Peel and Greene developed dramatic melodramas, and Marlowe went on to make them high-strung and quick-witted
 marlo ke naatakon main kathasutra shithil he lekin vah bhayankar antardvandvon kii geetimay akrutrim abhivyakti or bhavy chitra yojana main shakespeare kaa yogya guru he
 Marlowe's noted Tamberlane, Doctor Fastes and the heroes of 'the Jewel and Malta' collide and break with spiritual values due to their unbridled individualism
 is prakaar vyakti or samaaj ke bich sangharsh ko chitrit kar marlo pehle pahal punarjagran kii vah kendriya samasya prastut karata he jo shakespeare or anya naatakakaron ko bhi andolit karti rahi
 Marlow made the English play stand at the gates of the Golden Age
 wiliam shakespeare kaa praarambhik vikaas inhen paramparaon kii simaaon main hua
 His early plays attempt to achieve perfection in art
 is praarambhik praytn ke madhyam se usne apane naatakkaar ke vyaktitv ko pusht kiya
 His development in plot, characterization, language, verses, picture planning, and the grip of life was more laborious than other playwrights of that era, but his genius peaked in the late 16th and early 17th centuries
 is kaal ke naatakon main punarjagran kii sari saanskrithik or rachanaatmak kshamta pratibimbit ho uthi
 In this way, Shakespeare took the tales of the rulers of Rome from Plutarch towards the kings of England and Scotland from recent and Hollinshed history texts, but they filled the realization of the humanist era
 praarambhik sukhaant naatakon main usne lily or green kaa anukaran kiya, lekin 'e midsmar nits dream' or uske baad kii chaar aisi hi rachanaaon 'di marachent ov venice', 'much ado about nathing', 'twailphth nite' or 'aij you like it' main usne angreji sahitya main romentic kamedi ko nayaa rup diya
 Their atmosphere is different from court comedy
 vahaan ek aisa lok he jahaan swapn or yatharth kaa bhed mit jaataa he or jahaan hasya kii bauddhikta bhi hriday kii udaartaa se ardra he
 In 'measure for Measure' and 'all's Well That Ends Well', his final happy dramas, the atmosphere is like a sun hiding amidst the thick clouds and emanating from them
 duhkhaant naatakon main praarambhik kaal kii rachana 'romeo and juliet' main nayak-nayika kii mrityu ke baavjood paraajay kaa swar nahin he
 But 'hamlet', 'lear', 'athelo', 'mcweth', 'antony and Cleopatra' and Coriolanseff, written after the 16th century, depict the defeat of humanism in the conspiracy-ridden atmosphere of that era
 lekin uske bich bhi shakespeare kii apratihat aasthaa kaa swar uthta he
 In the end, he wrote 'perikalese', 'symbeline', 'the Winters Tale' and 'tempest' to get rid of the sensations in which the endings are happy despite the initial mishaps
 jivan ke vishad gyaan or kavy evam natya saundarya main shakespeare sansar kii ini-gini pratibhaaon main he
 Ben Johnson is the originator of the 'perverted' farce in English drama
 uske diksha guru platus or horess the, isliye vah acharya naatakkaar he or usne shakespeare ityadi kii romentic kamedi main virdohi tatwon ke samanvay kaa virodh kiya
 His fade deformity meant exaggerating the character traits of a character
 uski praathmik rachanaaon 'ebriman in hiz humar' or 'ebriman out ov hiz humar' main isi tarah kaa prahasan he
 According to Johnson, the duty of comedy was to present a portrait of its era and 'play' with the idiocy of human character
 is tarah usne vidrupapurna yathartwaadee prahasan naatak ko bhi janm diya jisamen uski prasiddh rachanaayen ' wolpon' or 'alchemist' hai
 Johnson's skit stings, not tickle
 james pratham ke shasankaal main samaaj main badhati hui asthirataa or niraashaa tathaa darbar main badhati hui kritrimata ne naatak ko prabhavit kiya
 Individualism manifested in unnatural ambitions, fierce bloodshed and cruelty, self-pity and despair in Shakespeare's later miseries of Webster, Turner, Middleton, Master Chapman, Messinger and Ford
 webster ke shabdon main, inkaa kendriya darshan ' phool ke paudhon ke mul main narmund' kii anivaaryta he
 In the comedy, Middleton and Mansinger were in the tradition of Johnson, but there was also an increase in gross farce and vulgarity
 jon palechar or francis bomaant main kamedi kaa patan swasth romance yaa prahasan kii jagah dukhapurna ghatnaon, nayak-nayikaon ke kaalpanik jivan, atyadhik alankrita or roodhipriy bhashaa tathaa aswabhaavik ghatnaon ke rup main dikh padaa
 Mask was also born in the same era with the inspiration of the court, which had grand visuals and decor and music predominance
 isi samay bhavi vikaas kii drushti se mahatvapurn paariwarik samasyamoolak duhkhaant naatakon main sabase prasiddh fa arden ov fevershaimaf he, jo likhaa pehle gaya tha par prakashit peeche hua
 In this way the drama was falling away from the public under the influence of the court
 vastav main bomaant or flechar kii traji-kamedi kaa abhinay fa priveta rangashaalaon main mukhyatah abhijatavargeey saamaajikon ke saamne hota tha
 If the play had a living connection to the public, it would be through plays by Johnson's disciple tradition or by Shakespeare's later tragic plays that were performed in the f Publicf theater
 angreji naatak ke vikaas kii shrunkhlaa sahasaa 1642 main tut gai jab kamanwealth yug main puritain sampradaay ke dabaav se sari rangashalas band kii di gayi
 He was reborn in 1660 with the re-incarnation of Charles II
 punarrajarohan kaal- france main lui chaturdash ke darbar main sharnaarthi kii tarah rah chuke charles dwitiya ke liye samskruti kaa adarsh france kaa darbar tha
 With him this ideal also came to England
 french reetikaar or naatakkaar angreji naatakakaron ke adarsh bane
 Upon Charles's return, the dormitories of Deer Lane and Dorset Garden were established
 rangashaalaon par swayan charles or duk ov york kaa niyantran tha
 The socialists of these theater were mainly courtiers, their girlfriends, bastards and some vagrants
 ab naatak bahusnkhyakon kii jagah alpsankhyakon kaa tha; isliye is yug main do tarah ke naatakon kaa udai or vikaas hua- ek, aise naatak jinaki fa hiroica duhkhaant kathavstu darbariyon kii ruchi ke anukool fa premuf or fa atmasammanf thi; duusare, aise prahasan jinamein charitraheen kintu kushagrabuddhi vyaktiyon ke saamaajik vyavhaaron kaa chithran hota tha 
 The management of scenes, lighting, etc
 in the theater began to work through the eyes more than the ears, leaving the inevitability of the pure poetry of the Elizabethan era plays
 striyon ne bhi rangamanch par aana shu degree kiya jisaki vajah se kathankon main kai-kai stri paatro ko rakhana sambhav hua
 Hiroikuff Tragedy is led by Dryden
 aise naatakon kii visheshtaayen thim-- asaadhaaran kshamta or adarsh vaale nayak prem main asaadhaaran rup se drudh or atyant sundar nayika, prem or atmasamman ke bich aantarik sangharsh, shaury, tukant kavita, oohatmak bhav evam abhivyakti tathaa teevr or sookshm anubhuti kii kami
 Dryden followed suit, but he had negligible success
 is kaal main atukant chhandon main bhi duhkhaant naatak likhe gaye or unamem hiroik tragedy kii apeksha naatakakaron ko adhik safalataa mili
 These were also generally about love
 lekin inaki duniya elizabeth yug ke naatakon ke bheeshan antardvandvon se bhinn thi
 Here too, the primacy was of emotional sentiment
 dryden ke atirikt aise naatakakaron main keval thomas otve hi ullekhneey he
 This era gave a new form of drama to the opera, which had music in addition to storytelling
 kamedi ov manurs ke vikaas ne angreji prahasan naatak kaa punaruddhar kiya
 Its famous authors are William Wickerly, William Congreeve, George Etherez, John Whonbrugge and George Farquhar
 inhone johnson ke yathartwaadee dhang se charles dwitiya ke darbariyon jaise amodapriy, pramada, prem ke liye anek durabhisandhiyon ke rachayita, naitikta or sadachaar ke prati udasin or saaf-suthri kintu paini boli vaale vyaktiyon kaa nagn chitra tatasthta ke saath khinchaa
 Preaching or social reform was not his goal
 iske kaaran in lekhakon par ashleelata kaa aarope bhi kiya jaataa he
 These plays have a variety of events replacing the mental diversity of Johnson's characters
 inhone johnson kii tarah charitron ko atiranjan kii style se ek-ek durgun kaa pratik na banaakar unhen unke saamaajik parivesh main dekha
 His greatest work was that he freed the English comedy from the artificial romantic sentimentality of Bommant and Fletcher, and made it a true comedy
 saath hi johnson kii parampara bhi shadwell or howard ne kaayam rakhi
 This century was the centenary of actors and actresses such as Garrick and Mrs
 Siddons, but in terms of drama design, the era saw only two big playwrights: Richard Binsley Sheridan and Oliver Goldsmith
 is shatabdi kii madhyavargeey naitikta ne is yug main bhavuk kamedi ko janm diya, jisamen prahasan se adhik jor sadachaar par tha
 Middle-class characters were often chosen to establish family happiness, ideal love and purity of heart
 aise naatakakaron main sabase prasiddh sibar, steel, keli or cumberland hai
 Sheridan and Goldsmith aimed for pure farce in place of such tearful irrational plays
 inhone romani tatwon ke sthaan par zonson or congriva ke yatharthwaad, vyangy, chubhti hui bhashaa or charitra-chithran main atiranjan kaa anusaran kiya
 Goldsmithized Phi Stoops to Kankarf and Sheridan's Fade the School for Scandal are counted among the masterpieces of English farce drama
 is shatabdi main kai lekhakon ne duhkhaant naatak likhe, lekin unamem edison kaa fa catoff hi ullekhneey he
 Pantomime, which in a way was pure vulgarity and ballad-opera, was also very popular in this era
 ge kaa geetinaty fa di begrsaf opera to europe ke kai deshon main abhinit hua
 Edward Moore's family problematic drama 'gamestar' is the best of such plays
 19veen shatabdi- romentic yug kaa purvardh naatak kii drushti se praayah shunya he
 Century, Coleridge, Birdsworth, Shelley, Keats, Byron, Lander, and Browning wrote plays, but mostly they are worth reading
 shatabdi ke uttarardh main ibson ke prabhaav se angreji naatak ko nai prerana mili
 Robertson, Jones, and Pinero wrote plays on family life to emulate Ibsen's realistic style
 unamem ibson kii pratibha nahin thi, lekin naatakeeyata or aadhunik style ke dwaara unhone aage kaa maarg saral kar diya
 Ibsen's promotion gave a new direction to the English drama
 uske naatakon kii kuch visheshtaayen ye thim- samaaj or vyakti kii saadhaaran samasyaayen; puraani naitikta kii aalochana; bahari sangharshon ke sthaan par aantarik sangharsh; rangamanch par yatharthwaad; vivarnaatmak saaj-sajja; swagat kaa bahishkaar; bolchaal kii bhashaa se nikatataa; pratikwaad
 Ibsen's plays are problem dramas
 20veen shatabdi ke praarambhik naatakakaron par ibson ke atirikt chekhav kaa bhi gaharaa asar padaa
 The most prominent of such playwrights are Granbill Barker, St
 John Hankin, John Mesfield, St
 John Arvin, Arnold Bennett, etc
, in addition to Shaw and Galsverdi
 is yug main kamedi ov manurs kii parampara bhi viksit hui he
 It was revived by Oscar Wilde in the late 19th century
 20veen shatabdi main iske pramukh lekhakon main shaw, mom, lansdel, saint arvin, munro, noel coard, trevers, retigan ityadi hai
 The tradition of problem plays has moved forward
 unke lekhakon main sabase prasiddh off kisi ke atirikt sheriff, miln, pristle or jon von druten hai
 The most famous of the historical dramatists of this era are Drinkwater, Bax and James Bridie
 kavy naatakon kaa vikaas bhi anek lekhakon ne kiya he
 Among them are Stephen Phillips, Yates, Mesfield, Drinkwater, Bamley, Flecker, Abercrombie, T
S
 Elliott, Auden, Isherwood, Christopher Fry, Duncan, Spender, etc
 aadhunik angreji naatak main ireland ke teen prasiddh naatakakaron, yets, ladi gregory or sinj kii bahut badi dein he
 In the era of realistic style, he maintained romantic and lyrical imagination and feeling in the play
 is prakaar spasht he ki 20veen shatabdi main angreji naatak kaa bahumukhi vikaas hua he
 Along with the development of theater, many changes have also taken place
 samasamyikta ke kaaran moolyankan main atiranjan ho saktaa he, lekin jis yug main shaw, garlsvardi, o kisi, yets, iliyat or sinj jaise naatakkaar hue hai uski uplabdhiyon kaa sthaayee mahatv he

 jabaki dusron ne sochaa kii yah memorial dow bhimrao ambedkar kaa kad karaara nahin tha kuch dizin ke vyaavhaarik vivaran par chintaa thi
 Prakash Ambedkar is pressed for the memorial to be a "think tank institution", an intellectual center of international standards for scholars across the world coming to intellectual activity as Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar is an intellectual giant who has separated many fields from many Had contributed in many ways
 aanandaraj ambedkar ne bhi rajya sarkaar ko apane dizin ke rup main dow
 bhimrao ambedkar, samanta kii pratimaa ke ek 360 foot oonchi pratimaa ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya tha jinka ek praaroop kaa suzav diya tha

 netaaon to mumbai ke kshitij ke ek prabhaavshaalee hisse ke rup main karne ke liye or pehali baat yah he ki mumbai main utarane aagantukon ke aane par unki aankhon karnaa hona chahie
 The new format of the grand international memorial of Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar, built on the land of Indu Mill in Mumbai, Dadar, has been approved by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on August 2016
 yah manjuuri rajya ke saamaajik nyaay mantri rajkumaar badole kii adhyakshata main banaai gai ek sadasyeey samiti ne di he
 According to this new format, a 350-foot-tall statue of Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar is proposed to be installed in the Ambedkar memorial on Indu Mill land
 pehle jo praaroop banaaya gaya tha usamen keval 80 foot oonchi pratimaa kaa hi prastaav tha
 But now a statue higher than the Statue of Liberty of America will be installed
 yah pratimaa sansad bhawan parisar main sthapit dow
 ambedkar pratimaa jaisi hi hogi or smarak ko sanchi ke vishwa prasiddh buddha stupa kii tarah banaaya jayega
 Apart from this, artwork based on the life of Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar will also be installed in the art gallery to be built here
 2014 main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke haathon smarak ke liye bhumipujan kiya gaya tha
 But some organizations objected to the format of the memorial
 republican sena ke aanandaraj ambedkar sahit kuch sanghathanon ne maang kii thi ki bhimrao kaa smarak america ke stachu of liberty se ooncha ho
 And in this context, a committee was formed under the chairmanship of Badole

 In addition to this, four other radioactive isotopes have also been constructed
 vang kii mishradhatu kaa upyog aaj se 5,000 varsh purv bhi hota tha
 The oldest bottle made of Vang metal was found in the mausoleum in Egypt, dating back to around 1,500 years BC
 vang ke ayask misr main nahin milte
 Therefore, this metal must have come from outside there

 Its volume on the Earth's surface is about 40 grams per ton
 iske pramukh ayask hai : caciterite, or sulphide
 Vung's main mines are in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Congo, Nigeria and Bolivia
 vang ke ayask main praaia: 1 se 5 pratishat tin oxide upasthit rahata he
 For this reason it is necessary to concentrate it
 ucch ghanatv tathaa achumbakeey gunon ke dwaara hi caciterite kaa sandran karte hai

 Vung dissolves in an alkaline solution to form stannate, which results in hydrogen release
 vang ke do prakaar ke yogic gyaat hai : ek stannas, jisamen vang kii sanyojaktaa 2 he or doosraa stanic, jisamen vang kii sanyojaktaa chaar rahati he
 It has two oxides, stannous oxy, and stannic oxy,

 Pierre della was a great painter of Italy
 landow-ramanujan sthirankaramanujan-sholdener sthirankaramanujan theta falnarogers-ramanujan tatsamakaramanujan abhajyakrutrim theta falanbus Srinivasa Ramanujan Iyengar was a great Indian mathematician
 inhen aadhunik kaal ke mahanatam ganit vichaarkon main gina jaataa he
 He did not get any special training in mathematics, yet he made deep contributions in the areas of analysis and number theory
 inhone apane pratibha or lagan se na keval ganit ke kshetra main adbhut avishkaar kiye varan bharat ko athulaneey gaurav bhi pradaan kiya
 He was a brilliant genius since childhood
 inhone khud se ganit siikhaa or apane jeevanabhar main ganit ke 3,884 pramayon kaa sankalan kiya
 Most of these theorems have been proved correct
 inhone ganit ke sahaj gyaan or bijganit prakalan kii adwitiya pratibha ke bal par bahut se moulik or aparmparik parinaam nikaale jinase prerit shodh aaj tak ho rahaa he, yadhyapi inaki kuch khojon ko ganit mukhyadhara main ab tak nahin apanaaya gaya he
 Recently their formulas have been used in crystal science
 inke kaary se prabhavit ganit ke kshetron main ho rahe kaam ke liye ramanujan jarnal kii sthapana kii gai he
 Ramanujan was born on 22 December 1887 in the village of Erode, Coimbatore, in the southern part of India
 vah paaramparik brahman parivaar main janme the
 His mother's name was Komaltammal and his father's name was Srinivasa Iyengar
 inkaa bachapan mukhyatah kumbhakonam main beetaa tha jo ki apane pracheen mandiron ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Ramanujan's intellectual development in childhood was not like that of ordinary children
 yah teen varsh kii aayu tak bolnaa bhi nahin sikh paae the
 When Ramanujan did not start speaking till such a great age, everyone was worried that he would be dumb
 baad ke varshon main jab unhone vidhyalay main pravesh liya to bhi paaramparik shiksha main inkaa kabhi bhi man nahin laga
 Ramanujan attained the highest marks in the entire district in the primary examination at the age of ten and reached the town high school for further education
 ramanujan ko prashn poochna bahut pasand tha
 His questions sometimes seemed very strange to the teachers
 jaise ki-sansar main pehla purush koun tha? prithvi or badalon ke bich kii duuri kitni hoti he? ramanujan kaa vyavhaar bada hi madhur tha
 His somewhat more gross body and glowing eyes of curiosity gave him a different identity
 inke sahpaathiyon ke anusaar inkaa vyavhaar itnaa saumy tha ki koi inase naaraaz ho hi nahin saktaa tha
 His talent in the school started making a mark on other students and teachers
 inhone skool ke samay main hi kalege ke str ke ganit ko pard liya tha
 Once the headmaster of his school had also said that the criteria for examinations to be held in the school does not apply to Ramanujan
 hiskool kii pariksha uteern karne ke baad inhen ganit or angreji me achche ank laane ke kaaran subramanyam chaatravrutti mili or aage kalege kii shiksha ke liye pravesh bhi mila
 a further problem occurred
 ramanujan kaa ganit ke prati prem itnaa bad gaya tha ki ve duusare vishyon par dhyaan hi nahin dete the
 He used to solve mathematics questions even in history, biology classes
 nateeja yah hua ki gyarahavin kaksha kii pariksha main ve ganit ko chhod kar baaki sabhi vishyon main fail ho gaye or parinamswaroop unako chaatravrutti milani band ho gai
 One, the financial condition of the house was poor and scholarship was not being received from above
 ramanujan ke liye yah bada hi kathin samay tha
 He also did some maths tuition and ledger work to improve the condition of the house
 kuch samay baad 1907 main ramanujan ne phir se barahavin kaksha kii privet pariksha di or anuteern ho gaye
 And with this, their traditional education was celebrated
 vidhyalay chhodane ke baad kaa paanch varshon kaa samay inke liye bahut hataasha bharaa tha
 At this time India was caught in the shackles of subordination
 chaaron taraf bhayankar garibi thi
 At such a time, Ramanujan had neither a job nor an opportunity to work with any institute or professor
 bas unka ishwar par atoot vishwaas or ganit ke prati agaadh shraddha ne unhen kartavya maarg par chalane ke liye sadaiv prerit kiya
 Namgiri Devi was the Ishta Devi of Ramanujan's family
 unke prati atoot vishwaas ne unhen kahin rukne nahin diya or ve itani vipareet paristhitiyon main bhi ganit ke apane shodh ko chalaate rahe
 At this time Ramanujan used to get a total of five rupees monthly from tuition and lived in it
 ramanujan kaa yah jivan kaal bahut ksht or dukh se bharaa tha
 He always had to wander around to maintain his education and continue his education and had to plead unsuccessfully to many people
 varsh 1908 main inke mata pita ne inkaa vivaah janaki naamak kanya se kar diya
 After marriage, it was no longer possible for them to forget everything and drown in mathematics
 atah ve naukari kii talash main madras aae
 He did not get a job due to not passing the XII examination and his health also fell badly
 ab doctor kii salaah par inhen waapas apane ghar kumbhakonam lautnaa padaa
 After recovering from illness, he came back to Madras and started looking for a job again
 ye jab bhi kisi se milte the to use apana ek register dikhaate the
 This register contained all the work done by him in mathematics
 isi samay kisi ke kehane par ramanujan vahaan ke dipti colector shri ve
 ramasvami ayyar se mili
 Iyer was a great scholar of mathematics
 yahaan par shri ayyar ne ramanujan kii pratibha ko pahachaanaa or jiladhikari shri ramchandra raav se kah kar inke liye 25 rupaye masik chaatravrutti kaa prabandh bhi kar diya
 On this instinct, Ramanujan published his first research paper in Madras for a year
 shodh patr kaa sheershak tha "barnauli sankhyaon ke kuch gun” or yah shodh patr jarnal of indian mathematical socity main prakashit hua tha
 After completing one year here, he worked as a clerk in Madras Port Trust
 saubhaahgya se is naukari main kaam kaa boj kuch zyada nahin tha or yahaan inhen apane ganit ke liye paryaapt samay miltaa tha
 Here Ramanujan used to stay awake all night and write new mathematical formulas and then take a rest for a while and then leave for office
 ramanujan ganit ke shodhon ko slate par likhte the
 And later wrote it down in a register
 raat ko ramanujan ke slate or khadie kii aawaaj ke kaaran parivaar ke anya sadasyon kii neend chaupat ho jaati thi
 At this time there was a great distance between Indian and Western living and due to this Indians were generally very hesitant to present their things to the British scientists
 idhar sthiti kuch aisi thi ki bina kisi angrej ganitagya kii sahaayta liye shodh kaary ko aage nahin badhaayaa ja saktaa tha
 At this time Ramanujan's old well wishers came to his work and these people sent the work done by Ramanujan to the famous mathematicians of London
 par yahaan inhen kuch vishesh sahaayta nahin mili lekin ek laabh yah hua ki log ramanujan ko thodaa bahut jaanane lage the
 At the same time, Ramanujan showed some formulas of his number theory to Professor Seshu Iyer, then he turned his attention to Professor Hardy of London
 professor hardi us samay ke vishwa ke prasiddh ganitagyon main se ek the
 And was known for his strict nature and discipline
 professor hardi ke shodhakarya ko padhane ke baad ramanujan ne bataaya ki unhone professor hardi ke anuttarit prashn kaa uttar khoj nikaala he
 Now Ramanujan's correspondence with Professor Hardy began
 ab yahaan se ramanujan ke jivan main ek nae yug kaa sutarapaat hua jisamen professor hardi kii bahut badi bhoomika thi
 In other words, the way a jeweler identifies a diamond and shines it, Professor Hardy has some similar place in Ramanujan's life
 professor hardi aaajeevan ramanujan kii pratibha or jivan darshan ke prashansak rahe
 This friendship of Ramanujan and Professor Hardy proved beneficial for both
 ek tarah se dekha jaae to dono ne ek duusare ke liye poorak kaa kaam kiya
 Professor Hardy valued various talented people of that time on a scale of 100
 adhikansh ganitagyon ko unhone 100 main 35 ank die or kuch vishisht vyaktiyon ko 60 ank die
 But he gave Ramanujan a full 100 in 100 points
 aarambh main ramanujan ne jab apane kiye gaye shodhakarya ko professor hardi ke paas bheja to pehle unhen bhi puraa samaj main nahin aayaa
 When he consulted his friend mathematicians, he came to the conclusion that Ramanujan is a rare personality in the field of mathematics and that he should come to England to understand the work done by him and to further research in it
 atah unhone ramanujan ko cambridge aane ke liye aamantrit kiya
 For some personal reasons and lack of funds, Ramanujan declined Professor Hardy's invitation to Cambridge
 professor hardi ko isse niraashaa hui lekin unhonen kisi bhi tarah se ramanujan ko vahaan bulaane kaa nishchay kiya
 At the same time, Ramanujan got a research career at the University of Madras, which made his life a bit easier and he was also getting full time for research work
 isi bich ek lambey patravyavhaar ke baad dhire-dhire professor hardi ne ramanujan ko cambridge aane ke liye sahamat kar liya
 Ramanujan was also funded by Professor Hardy's efforts to go to Cambridge
 ramanujan ne england jane ke pehle ganit ke kareeb 3000 se bhi adhik naye sutron ko apni notebook main likhaa tha
 Ramanujan stepped on the land of London
 vahaan professor hardi ne unke liye pehle se vvavastha kii hui thi atah inhen koi vishesh pareshaani nahin hui
 Ramanujan had little trouble in England and the reason for this was his shy, calm nature and pure satvic lifestyle
 apane puure england pravaas main ve adhikanshtah apana bhojan swayan banaate the
 This journey of England brought a revolutionary change in his life
 unhone professor hardi ke saath mil kar ucchkoti ke shodhpatr prakashit kiye
 Due to his special research he was awarded BA by Cambridge University
 Also got the title of
 lekin vahaan kii jalwaayu or rahan-sahan kii style unke adhik anukool nahin thi or unka swasthya kharaab rahane laga
 The doctors called it tuberculosis
 us samay kshay rog kii koi dawa nahin hoti thi or rogi ko senetorium me rahanaa padataa tha
 Ramanujan also had to stay there for a few days
 vahaan is samay bhi yah ganit ke sutron main nai nai kalpanaaen kiya karte the
 After this, Ramanujan was named a Fellow of the Royal Society
 aise samay main jab bharat gulaami main ji rahaa tha tab ek ashwet vyakti ko royal socity kii sadsyta milanaa ek bahut badi baat thi
 In the entire history of the Royal Society, there has been no member younger than them till date
 puure bharat main unke shubhachintakon ne utsav manaaya or sabhaayen kii
 After membership of the Royal Society, he also became the first Indian to get the fellowship of Trinity College
 ab aisa lag rahaa tha ki sab kuch bahut acchhee jagah par ja rahaa he
 But Ramanujan's health was deteriorating and eventually he had to return to India on the advice of doctors
 bharat aane par inhen madras vishvavidhyalay main praadhyaapak kii naukari mil gai
 And Ramanujan was rekindled in teaching and research
 bharat lautne par bhi swasthya ne inkaa saath nahin diya or haalat gambhir hoti ja rahi thi
 In the case of this disease also, he wrote a high level research paper on mock theta function
 ramanujan dwaara pratipaadit is falan kaa upyog ganit hi nahin balki chikitsavigyaan main cancer ko samajhane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 His declining health became a matter of concern for all and even now doctors have given him the answer
 ant main ramanujan ke vidaa kii ghadi aa hi gai
 In the morning of 26 April 1920, he became unconscious and by midday he gave up his life
 is samay ramanujan kii aayu maatr 33 varsh thi
 His untimely demise was an irreparable loss to the mathematics world
 puure desh videsh main jisane bhi ramanujan kii mrityu kaa samachar suna vahiin stabdh ho gaya
 Ramanujan and most of the work done by him still remains an enigma for scientists
 ek bahut hi saamaanya parivaar main janm le kar puure vishwa ko aashcharyachakit karne kii apni is yatra main inhone bharat ko apurv gaurav pradaan kiya
 His old register on which he used to write his theorems and formulas was suddenly found in the library of Trinity College in 1976
 kareeb ek sau pannon kaa yah register aaj bhi vaigyanikon ke liye ek paheli bana hua he
 This register was later known as Ramanujan's note book
 mumbai ke tata moolbhoot anusandhan santhaan dwaara iskaa prakaashan bhi kiya gaya he
 Like Ramanujan's researches, his style of working in mathematics was also bizarre
 ve kabhi kabhi aadhi raat ko sote se jaag kar slate par ganit se sutara likhane lagate the or phir so jate the
 In this way it seemed that they were solving mathematics questions even in their dreams
 ramanujan ke naam ke saath hi unki kuladevi kaa bhi naam liya jaataa he
 He always kept in mind zero and infinite and used the mathematical formulas to explain its interrelationships
 ramanujan ke kaary karne kii ek visheshta thi
 Earlier, he used to write a new formula or theorem of mathematics but did not pay much attention to its origin
 iske bare main puche jane par ve kehete the ki yah sutara unhen namgiri devi kii krupa se praapt hue hai
 Ramanujan's faith in spirituality was so deep that he considered any work done in the field of mathematics as a part of spirituality
 ve dharm or aadhyatm main keval vishwaas hi nahin rakhte the balki use taarkik rup se prastut bhi karte the
 He used to say that "for me that mathematics formula does not mean that i do not get spiritual thoughts
" ” Ramanujan worked mainly in the field of number theory in England for five years
 ramanujan ne nimnlikhit sutara pratipaadit kiya- The specialty of this formula is that it expresses the relation of the two most famous constants of mathematics through an infinite continuous fraction
 pai ke liye unhone ek doosraa sutara bhi diya tha- 'ramanujan number' is a natural number that can be represented in two different ways by the sum of cubes of two numbers
 udhaaharan - 9 3 + 10 3 = 1 3 + 12 3 = 1729 { \ displaystyle 9^{3}+10^{3}=1^{3}+12^{3}=1729} 
 Similarly, atah 1729, 4104, 20683, 39312, 40033 aadi ramanujan sankhyaayein hai

 When those who get small positions, become masters of limited things, when they satisfy the pride and are proud, then the feeling of being the suzerain of the whole world will be encouraging, the mind becomes enchanted by its imagination

 "khurd" means "small" and "kalan" means big
 in naamon ko mughaliya jamaane se prayog kiya ja rahaa he
 The word Khurd was applied behind small towns and villages
 farsi ke is shabd kaa arth hota he chota
 This Khurd is made from Sanskrit petty, which has a feeling of smallness, smallness or subtlety
 desh bhar main khurd dhari gaanvon kii taadaad hajaaron main he
 Similarly, the word Kalan is associated with many villages like Kosi Kalan, Bamaniya Kalan
 jis tarah khurd shabd chote yaa laghu kaa paryaay bana usee tarah kalam shabd bade yaa vishaal kaa paryaay bana
 Kalan was used in almost the same sense as the word Greater India was used in ancient times for India which covered the entire territory from Burma to Iran
 haalanki kisi yatravrit main hindustan kalam jaisaa shabd nahin miltaa
 When Greater Britain was talked about, there was a reference to its colonies
 isi tarah kalam shabd kii arthvatta bhi gramin aabaadiyon ke sandarbh main mahatvapurn he
 Kalan is basically a Persian word meaning senior, big, tall or huge

 Similarly, the word jagir was attached to it, given the specific status of a village
 iskaa arth yah hua ki salanaa rajasav vasuuli se us gaanv kaa hissaa sarkari khajaane main nahin jayega athwa use aanshik chhot milegi
 During the Mughal era, people were given to influential people or people of general category as a reward in the village estate

 There are many villages, cities and neighborhoods in North India, Pakistan and Afghanistan that started in one place and then spread to two parts - a major or major part and a small part
 aise main bade hisse ke naam ke peeche "kalaan" kaha jane laga or chote hisse ke peeche "kurd"
 There are thousands of examples in this area - kabhi-kabhi do gaanv or bastiyaan alag to hoti hai lekin bad-badhkar ek dusre se milakar ek hi ho jaati hai
 In such a situation, it is the custom in this area to make it clear that both Khurd and Kalan are being talked about and they are called "khurd Kalan - in donon shabdon kaa prayog kuch or sandarbhon main bhi hota he - The French Revolution was a period of political and social upheaval and radical changes in the history of France that lasted from 1789 to 1799

 As a result of the revolution, the king was removed from the throne, a republic was established, bloody conflicts took place, and finally the dictatorship of Napoleon was established, which spread many values of this revolution in and outside Western Europe

 He made laws against his will
 usne shakti kaa atyadhik kendriyakaran rajtantr ke paksh main kar diya
 France expanded by diplomacy and military prowess
 is tarah usne rajtantr ko gambhir pesha banaaya
 The governance that Louis 14th centralized required a worthy king, but his successors Louis 15th and Louis 16th were completely inept

" " apane ek mantri ke tyaagptr ke samay usne kaha ki-kaash! main bhi tyaagptr de paata
 His wife Mary Antoniet had a great influence on him
 vah phijulkharchi karti thi
 He had no understanding of the troubles of the common man
 ek baar jab logon kaa juluus roti kii maang kar rahaa tha to usne salaah di ki yadi roti uplabdh nahin he to log kek kyon nahin khate
 In this way the governance system of the country was completely dependent on bureaucracy
 jo vanshanugat thi
 There were no rules for their recruitment and training and there was no institution that could control these bureaucrats
 is tarah shashan pranali puri tarah bhrasht, nirankush, niskriy or shoshankari thi
 The law of personal law and the will of the king applied
 faltah desh main ek samaan kanoon samhita kaa abhaav tathaa vibhinn kshetron main vibhinn kanoonon kaa prachlan tha
 Due to this chaotic and complicated law, the public did not have knowledge of their own law

 These oppressive political circumstances gave way to revolution

 " kranti ke kaarnon ko saamaajik paristhitiyon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 French society was heterogeneous and disintegrated
 vah samaaj teen virgon / stats main vibhakt tha
 The clergy in the first states, the nobility in the second states and the general public in the third states
 padri evam kuleen varg ko vyapak visheshadhikaar praapt tha jabaki jansadharan adhikaar viheen tha
 The number of farmers was the highest and their condition was low and thoughtful 
 kisaanon ko rajya, carch tathaa anya jamidaaron ko anek prakaar ke kar dene padate the or saamanti atyaachaari ko sahanaa padataa tha
 In a sense, the main reason for the dissatisfaction of the farmers was the hardships and inconveniences being given by the feudal lords and the monarchy was silent on it
 is tarah kisaan itane duhkhi ho chuke the ki ve swayan hi ek krantikari tatv ke rup main parinat ho gaye or unhen kranti karne ke liye maatr ek sanket kii aavashyaktaa thi
 The middle class consisted of moneylender merchants, teachers, lawyers, doctors, writers, artists, employees etc
 unki aarthik dasha main avashya thik thi phir bhi ve tatkaaleen raajnneetik, saamaajik or aarthik paristhitiyon ke prati acroshit the
 This class had no political authority and the behavior of the clergy and the nobility was not good towards them
 is kaaran madhyavarg kulinon ke saamaajik shreshthata se ghrinaa rakhte tha or raajnneetik vyavastha main parivartan kar apane adhikaron ko praapt karne ke icchhuk tha
 This was the reason that he was the main contributor to the French Revolution and he led the revolution
 madhyavarg ke kuch aarthik shikaayatein bhi thi
 Due to the erstwhile commerce trade, this class had acquired wealth, but now in the feudal environment, there were many restrictions on their trade and had to pay tax in place
 ve apane vyapaar vyavsaay ke liye unmukt vaataavaran chaahate the
 For this, he led the revolution
 is tarah ham kah sakate hai ki france kii kranti francisi samaaj ke do paraspar virdohi guton ke sangharsh kaa parinaam thi
 On the one hand there were influential groups from the political point of view and on the other side from the economic point of view
 desh kii raajnneeti or sarkaar par prabhutv kaayam karne ke liye in donon virgon main sangharsh anivaary tha
 Thus the French Revolution of 1789 was a struggle against inequality in French society
 france kii aarthik avasthaa sankatagrast thi
 The state was on the verge of bankruptcy
 vastutah france ke raajaaon kii phijulkharchi tathaa lui 14wein ke lagaataar yudhon ke kaaran shahi kosh khaali ho gaya tha
 After his death, Louis 15th participated in the Austrian succession war and the Seven Year War, which further increased the burden on the treasury and eventually Louis 16th made France's economic condition worse by participating in the American War of Independence
 samraat, samraji or unke parivaar par rajya kii atyadhik raashi kharch kii jaati thi
 The palace of Versailles became a means of looting the treasury

 Due to privileges, the rich class was exempt from tax and the poor farmer who was economically poor was the only taxpayer
 is tarah rajkosh kii sthiti atyant sochneey ho gai thi
 In France, the government fixed income according to expenditure rather than spending according to income

 Whether France was unable to pay the interest of the principal money means that the state had reached a state of bankruptcy

 In the context of the role of philosophers in the French Revolution, two opinions emerge - one, the philosophers created the revolution by giving rise to the circumstances of the revolution and secondly the source of the revolution was in the faults of the national life of that time and in the mistakes of the government and The philosophers did not produce a revolution
 kisi bhi mat par nirnay dene ke purv un darshanikon ke vichaaron or kranti ke saath unke sambandhon ko samajhnaa vaanchhneeya hoga
 The determination of the popularity of the ideas of philosophers should be seen on the basis of the volumes and prevalence of the articles printed at that time
 montescue ne apni pustak 'da spirit of loj' main raja ke daivi adhikaron ke siddhanton kaa khandan kiya or francisi raajnneetik sansthaaon kii aalochana hi nahin ki varan vikalp bhi prastut kiya
 He wrote that the French government is an autocratic government because in France all the powers related to executive, judiciary and legislature are concentrated in the hands of one person ie the king, so the French people do not have freedom
 isi sadanrbh main usne “shakti ke pruthakkaran” kaa siddhanth diya jiske anusaar shashan ke teen pramukh ang-karypalika, nyaaypalik or vyavasthapika ko alag-alag haathon main rakhane kii salaah di
 He described the Government of England as ideal because there was a constitutional monarchy whereby the citizens were at liberty there
 is prakaar montescue ne shakti ke pruthakkaran ke madhyam se france kii nirankush raaj vyavastha par chot kii uske ye vichaar itane lokapriy hue ki 'da spirit of laaj' ke teen varshon main chah sanskaran prakashit hue
 It is to be noted here that Montescue neither talked of revolution nor the abolition of the monarchy, he just exposed the faults of autocratic monarchy and talked about constitutional monarchy
 waltare ne apni pustakon ke letters on inglish madhyam se britain kii udaar raajnneeti, dharm or vichaar swatantraaa kaa vishad chithran kiya tathaa puraatan francisi vyavastha se uski tulana kii or france main vyaapt buraaiyon evam kamiyon kaa ullekh kiya
 These books became very popular before being banned
 “waltare” ne carch ke bhrasht achaaran, ashishnutaa, anyaay, daman or atyaachaar ke virodh main likhaa
 Pointing fingers at the corruption of the church, he wrote that there is no Christian left because there was only one Christian and he was crucified
 usne likhaa ki kukhyat evam badnaam cheez ko kuchal do
 This was clearly an attack on the tyrannical monarchy of France and the tyranny of the Church
 waltare england ke sanvaidhanik rajtantr ke anuroop hi france main bhi vaisaa hi shashan sthapit karnaa chahta tha

 ruson ne kaha ki samuhik ichha se bane rajya kaa yah anivaary tathaa saarvbhaum kartavya he ki vah saare samaaj ko sarvopari maanate hue kaary ko sanchalit karen
 The people who have been entrusted with executive power are the executive, not the owner of the people, and their duty is to obey the orders of the people
 is tarah uskaa drudh vishwaas tha ki sarvopari satta janata ke haath main honi chahie kisi kisi ek vyakti yaa sanstha ke haath main nahin
 Sovereign power is rooted in the will of the people which is called "common will"

 The Russians also did not talk of revolution but considered all people as free and equal and the slogans of the French Revolution were influenced by his ideas of freedom, equality and fraternity
 nepolian ne uske mahatv ko sweekaar karte hue kaha ki yadi ruson nahin hota to france main kranti nahin hoti
 The popularity of the Russian social contract can be gauged from the fact that 13 editions were published in a year

 The farmers hoped that by raising their voice against feudal privileges, they would be able to secure their rights and be free from their exploitation cycle
 is tarah francisi rajtantr kaa samarthan karne ke liye francisi jansankhya kaa koi mahatvapurn bhaag taiyaar nahin tha
 In the session of the Estates General, there was a dispute between the third state and other states on the issue of voting system
 matdaan ke bare main kaha gaya ki prayek state kaa ek hi mat mana jayega
 In this way, the privileged class has two and the public has only one opinion
 jansadharan ke pratinidhiyon ne arthath 'tritiy state' ne is matdaan pranali kaa virodh kiya kyonki isse ve bahut main hote hue bhi alpamat main aa jate
 The third state wanted the representatives of the three categories to sit together and decide by majority, but the clergy and the elite wanted separate meetings
 atah tritiy state ne stats general kii baithak kaa bahishkaar kar apane ko samast raashtra kaa pratinidhi maanate hue rashtriya sabha ke rup main ghoshit kar diya or paas ke tennis court main apni sabha bulaai
 The French Revolution reached its end through various stages
 adhyayan kii suvidha kii drushti se kranti ko nimnlikhit chaar charnon main baantkar dekha ja saktaa he
 At this stage the Parisian mob established control of the Bastille fort
 is tarah kranti kii shuruuaat hui
 In fact, the Bastille fort was a symbol of tyranny and tyranny and its fall posed a deep challenge to the archaic system
 is ghatana kaa prabhaav france ke gramin kshetron main bhi padaa or graminon ne saamanti karon ke abhilekhon ko aag laga di
 These proceedings of the public also had a profound impact on the National Assembly
 atah 4 agast 1789 jo raat bhar kaa rashtriya sabha kaa adhiveshan chalaa jisamen kanoon nirmit karke sabhi visheshadhikaron ko samaapt kar diya
 Thus England and America were abolished
 rashtriya sabha kaa mahatvapurn kaary tha- ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan karnaa
 Therefore, the National Assembly was called the Constituent Assembly and on 26 August 1789, the Constituent Assembly declared human rights
 samvidhan sabha ne apane aadarshon tathaa uddeshyon ke rup main maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 This declaration emphasized the principle of equality and it was said that since all human beings are born equal, they should get equal rights
 in adhikaron main swatantraaa, sampatti suraksha tathaa atyaachaar ke virodh kaa adhikaar aadi shaamil the
 In this way, the Constituent Assembly declared the fundamental principles, freedom, equality and dominance of the people
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko ghoshnaa patr main baar-baar duharaaya gaya
 No one could be denied this right
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne carch kii sampatti ko jabt kar liya or janata par carch ke niyantran ko kam karne kaa prayaas kiya
 In this context, the Church was brought under the Kingdom and was transformed from the influence of the Pope of Rome into a National Church
 rajya ke prati padariyon kii vafadari surakshit karne ke liye "civil constichution of cllerji" banaaya gaya
 According to which the priests had to take an oath of allegiance to the state and they were elected by the public
 pope or kuch padariyon ne is kadam kaa virodh kiya
 The clergy who swore allegiance to the state were called "jurors" while those who did not take the oath were called "non-jurors"
 is kanoon se kranti ke viruddh ek maahaul nirmit hone laga kyonki abhi tak chote padariyon ne kranti kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Now they broke away from it and some clergy left the country and went abroad and started campaigning against the revolution in Europe there
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne france ke liye likhit sanvadhin taiyaar kiya or is samvidhan ko 1791 main lui solahaven ne apni sweekruti de di
 The Constitution emphasizes two things - one, the sovereign power of the state is vested in the people and second, the separation of power is in the interest of the state and the people
 yadhyapi shashan pranali rajtantratmak bani raheen parantu raja ke adhikaron ko simit kiya gaya
 He is no longer a lawmaker

 The authority to legislate was given to an assembly and its members numbered 745
 vyavasthapika ke sadasyon ke nirvachan ke liye nagarikon ko sakriy or nishkray do bhaagon main vibhakt kar diya gaya or matadhikaar keval sakriy nagarikon ko diya gaya
 Active citizens were those over the age of 25 who paid the state direct tax equal to three days' income while inactive citizens were those who were poor

 There was an Election Council to run the rule of each of the units, which were elected by active citizens
 is tarah sthaneey str se lekar kendriya str tak sari rajya vyavastha bargea varg main aa gai
 After the dissolution of the National Assembly, in 1791 AD, a 745-member administrative body came into existence
 is vyavasthapika sabha main adhyaksh ke daahine haath kii ore baithne vaale 'dakshinpanthi' kehalaae
 These people were orthodox and supportive of the monarchy, while those on the left were called 'leftists' and this group was of the original changeists who were radical and revolutionary
 radicals bhi do virgon main bante the- jirondist or doosraa jacobiyan
 Meanwhile, the fear of the French Revolution started spreading to other countries of Europe
 jo padri evam kuleen varg france se bhaag europe ke anya kshetron ke chale gaye the unhone kranti ke viruddh bhaavana failaai
 On the other hand, French revolutionaries wanted to propagate revolutionary principles in other countries as well
 faltah europe ke anya raja shankit hue
 As a result, the relations between revolutionary France and other countries of Europe deteriorated
 austria ne krantikariyon ke manaa karne par bhi france ke rajtantr ke samarthak sharnaarthiyon ko apane yahaan rahane diya tha
 Therefore, in April 1792, the Legislative Assembly declared war against Austria, but the French army was badly defeated
 is paraajay se france kii janata ko vishwaas ho gaya ki raja ne austria ko france kii sainya shakti or suraksha ke saare bhed bataa die hai
 Hence the public's attitude towards the king became fierce
 in sthitiyon main francisi rajtantr ke samarthan main prasha or austria ne ghoshnaa kii ki france kii janata raja kii ajna kaa paalan kare anyathaa ham unke viruddh kaarywahi karenge
 In this way the French Revolution created a war situation in Europe
 is ghoshnaa se france kii janata or ugr ho gai or usne raja ko gher liya
 The king escaped and took refuge in the assembly
 ab yah vichaar kiya jane laga ki vyavasthapika sabha bhang kii jaae; punah chunaav ho, nayi vyavasthapika sabha bane or vah rajtantr ke bhavishya par apana nirnay de
 With this, the assembly was abolished and a national convention was formed on the basis of adult suffrage
 21 sintabar 1792 ko neshnal kanveshan kaa pratham adhiveshan hua
 The Jacobian and Jirodist parties were prominent in this
 jacobiyan anushaasit or sangathit the
 He had influence on the Parisian crowd
 isamen pramukh netaa the- dante, robspier, heater aadi
 On the other side there were jirondists - these were educated and cultured people
 inhen kitaabi gyaan adhik tha
 As a result, they were not practical politicians
 pramukh netaa the- isnar, madam rolland, briso aadi
 It is to be understood here that both factions were advocates of the Republic, supporting the war against foreign powers
 antar keval swaroop kaa tha
 In fact, Jirodisto took a liberal position in France
 unka maananaa tha kii kranti bahut aage ja chuki he or uskaa ant hona chahie
 They were against bringing more social equality
 ve swatantraaa par adhik jor dete the
 On the other hand, the Jacobians emphasized more on equality and had a harmonious attitude towards the lower classes
 neshnal kanvension ke saamne teen pramukh samasyaayein thi- videshi akraman, raja kii maujuudagi or grihayuddh
 In September 1792, the French army occupied Belgium and in the south Nees and Savoy also came under its control
 in vijayon se holland, austria, prasha or england ghabara gaye
 The revolutionaries also declared in 1792 that the Republic of France was based on feelings of freedom, equality and fraternity, and it was their duty to spread these feelings
 france jin jagahon par aadhipatay kaayam karegaa vahaan krantikari siddhanton ko lagu karegaa or padariyon or kulinon kii sampatti chin legaa or jo bhi desh iskaa virodh karegaa use kranti kaa shutra samaj jayega
 The autocratic monarchy countries of Europe were frightened by this announcement and now the revolution of France turned to the whole of Europe, not France
 atah europea desh kranti ke prasar ko rokane ke liye ekajute ho gaye or england, holland, austria, prasha ke ek gut kaa france ke viruddh nirmaan hua
 This group defeated France in many places
 faltah videshi yuddh main france kii paraajay neshnal kanveshan ke samaksh ek mukhya samasya ban gai
 The National Convention passed a resolution that abolished the monarchy and established the republic
 raja par deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya gaya or mrityudand kii sajaa di gai
 The policy of the Jirendistas on the question of the slaughter of the king was not clear
 ve rajtantr ke virdohi to the lekin vadh ke prashn par janamat sangrah kii baat kar rahe the
 In contrast, the Jacobians believed that the king's treason had been proved
 atah use mrityudand diya janaa chahie
 Finally, on 16 January 1793, Louis 16th was hanged
 neshnal kanvension ko jacobiyan or jirodishton ke bich sangharsh kii samasya kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa
 In fact, France was beset by an economic crisis due to war, with prices soaring that the Convention enacted legislation to provide relief, a rule to collect debt from the rich
 in kadamon kaa jirondixton ne virodh kiya
 When Jacobio invaded the Convention with the help of the Paris mob and the commune, he took power and arrested Jirondisto and established a state of terror
 'aatank ke rajya' kii sthapana ke saath hi france ek baar punah avyavashtha kaa shikaar hua
 It was founded under the leadership of Robspier
 isamen krantikari, jansuraksha kii sthapana kii gai thi or jo koi jaikabins ke viruddh kaam karata use mrityudand kii sajaa di jaati
 Robespierre was influenced by the ideology of the Russians

 Robespierre put opponents on the "guillotine" to control power
 atah sabhi vyakti apane jivan ko lekar sashankit ho uthe
 Finally in July 1794, Robespierre was imprisoned and hanged, ending the reign of Terror
 aantak ke rajya ke baad 'thermidorian kii pratikriya' hui
 Liberal Thermidorian leaders took over the power of the country and dissolved the militant state systems, declaring the Jacobians illegal
 aantak ke shashan ke dauraan lagaae gaye mulya tathaa paarishramik par se niyantran uthaa liya gaya
 Due to which the prices rose again, the influence of speculators increased and the rebellions in response, but these rebels were suppressed
 tritiy charan-1794-99 -“diarectory” kaa shashan vastutah neshnal kanvension ne ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan kar karypalika kaa uttardaayitv 5 sadasyeey “nideshak mandal” ko saunpa
 The rights of all the members of the board were equal
 prayek sadsy baari-baari se teen maheene ke liye adhyaksh hua karte the
 Each year a member term was to end and another member was to be appointed instead
 is tarah neshnal kanvension ke baad france main diarectory kaa shashan shuru hua jo 1795 se 1799 tak chalaa
 Hence, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule
 diarectory kaa yah shashan avyavasthit, dukhamay rahaa
 The Board of Directors was empowered to control the Armed Forces and to appoint Chiefs of Army, to make treaties or to wage war on behalf of France
 sanchaalak mandal ke saamne sabase pramukh samasya thi yuddh kii samasya, duusari taraf diarectory ke sadsy anubhavheen, ayogy tathaa bhrasht the
 Therefore, during the rule of the directory, various kinds of disturbances spread, unemployment increased, trade was halted and its foreign policy was also weak
 aisi sthiti main france kii janata ek aise shaasha kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kar rahi thi jo desh ke andar or baahar shanti sthapit kar sake tathaa videshi shaktiyon ko parrast kar sake
 During this period Napoleon established the honor of France by military victories and eventually ended the rule of the Directory and established control of power
 1799 main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kiya or france kaa pratham counsal bana or 1804 i
 main usne apane ko samraat ghoshit kar diya or is tarah nepolian ke taanaashaahee samrajyavaadee shashan kii shuruuaat hui
 France is the only country in Europe that has ensured the collapse of the archaic system through revolution
 is kranti kaa prabhaav europe tak hi simit na rahaa
 It affected the whole world
 kranti ke naare swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kaa prasar puure europe main hua
 On the one hand, while it gave opportunity to new powers like nationalism, democraticism to flourish, on the other hand it also laid the foundation of modern dictatorship and militarism
 francisi kranti ke prabhaavon ko nimna binduon ke tahat samajha ja saktaa haih The nature of the French Revolution needs to be understood in light of the ideals of the revolution, the leadership of the revolution, the progress of the revolution, the changes brought during the revolution and the effects on the world
 is drushti se kranti ek aisi kranti thi jiskaa prarambh to kuleen varg ne kiya, phir aage chalakar iskaa netritv madhyavarg ke haathon main aayaa
 It remained under the influence of revolutionary elements for some time and ended with a military dictator
 is tarah francisi kranti us vishaal nadi kii tarah jo ucch parvat shikhar se prarambh hokar maarg main anek chote-mote parvaton ko laanghti hui kabhi teevr gati se, to mand gati se pravaahman rahi
 The French Revolution of 1789 can be seen as a bourgeois revolution
 kranti ke pratham charan main netritv tritiy state ke burjuai tatwon ke haathon main tha
 The middle class leadership should also formulate some principles keeping in mind personal property
 vastutah samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa to kar di gai kintu saamanti adhikaron ko yun hi nahin chhod diya gaya, balki bhumipatiyon kii kshatipurti karne ke baad hi kisaan kisi uttardaayitv se mukt ho sakate the
 Middle class influence can be seen in the Declaration of Human Rights
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko manushya ke naiysargik adhikaron kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya jo burjua hiton ke sangrakshan se sambandhit he
 Similarly, adult suffrage was talked about, but in the Constitution the word "citizen" was used in a very narrow sense
 naagarik ko sakriy va niskriy nagarikon main vibhajit kiya gaya
 Active citizens were those who paid at least three days' income as direct taxes and only had the right to vote
 pratinidhi hone ke liye bhi sampatti kii yogyata ko aadhaar banaaya gaya or yah dhani log hi raajnneetik kriyakalapon main bhaag le sakate the or iskaa matlab tha ki dhani log madhyavarg se jude the
 In this way, the French Revolution destroyed the discrimination based on birth, but was replaced by the new feudalism based on wealth instead of ancient feudalism
 kranti ke dauraan krantikariyon ne nirankush sarkaar dwaara liye gaye rinon kii baat to kii kintu un rinon ko maaf karne kii baat kisi ne nahin kii
 The reason was that this loan was given to the government by the bourgeoisie
 isi prakaar sarkaar ne carch kii sampatti ko to jabt kiya parantu use bhoomihinon ko nahin baanta gaya
 The lands were sold at the highest prices and the middle class had the ability to buy this land
 francisi kranti ne mazdooron ke hiton ko najrandaaj kiya or shramik andolan ko hatotsahit kiya
 The working class played an important role during the revolution, but the bourgeois leadership did not approve of its growing position
 atah neshnal asembli ne nirankush rajtantr yug main nirmit kanoonon ko punah lagu kar diya
 Due to which all trade union related works were banned and guilds were declared illegal
 neshnal essembali main burjuaon kii pradhanta thi or usamen jirondist or jacobiyan bhi burjua varg se sambandhit the
 Although the Jacobians spoke of the interests of the proletariat, the establishment of a state of terror kept bourgeois interests above and army's help was taken to suppress the workers' reactions
 diarectory ke shashan main bhi madhyavargeey hiton ko pramukhataa di gai
 All members of the bicameral legislature that the governing board created were middle-class intellectuals
 nepolian ke sudhaaron par bhi burjuai prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 He protected the right to property in his code of law, preserving bourgeois interests, giving relatively broad rights to the nobles and the middle class benefited from its commercial and commercial reforms
 is tarah kranti ke swaroop main madhyavargeey tatv dikhaai dete hai
 But from the analysis of the entire revolution and its impact, it is clear that in the revolution there was co-existence of farmers, laborers, women with middle class elements
 is tareeke se yah maatr madhyavargeey kranti nahin thi apitu ek lokapriy kranti ke rup main ise dekha ja saktaa he
 The French Revolution took on a worldwide character
 krantikariyon ne 1789 main manushya tathaa naagarik adhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii, jiske tahat kaha gaya ki janm se samaan paidaa hone ke kaaran sabhi manushyon ko samaan adhikaar milanaa chahie or yah sabhi deshon ke liye sabhi manushyon ke liye, sabhi samay ke liye or udhaaharan swaroop sari duniya ke liye hai
 This declaration was made not just for France but for the good of all people everywhere who wanted to be independent and to be free from the burden of autocratic monarchy and feudal privileges
 neshnal essembali dwaara 1792 i
 main compene naamak angeraj nayak ko francisi naagarik kii oopaadhi di gai or use neshnal kanvension kaa pratinidh bhi chunaa gaya
 Similarly, during the revolution, the idea was to expand the revolution to other countries of Europe to keep it stable and strong
 isamen ek aise yuddh kii kalpana kii gai jisamen francisi senaayen padosi deshon main pravesh kar vahaan ke sthaneey krantikariyon se milakar rajtantr ko apdasth kar ganatantron kii sthapana karti he
 The French Revolution was not just a national event, but the whole Europe resonated with the principles - slogans of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke prabhaav itane doorgaami rahe ki samast europe isse aachhadit hua
 It was said in this context that "if France has a cold, then all of Europe sneezes
" ” The French Revolution was not as well planned as the Russian Revolution
 vastutah roosi kranti bolshevikon dwaara suniyojit thi or uskaa uddeshy satta hasil kar sarvhaara kaa shashan sthapit karnaa tha lekin francisi kranti shuru se ant tak ghatnaon or paristhitiyon kaa shikaar raheen or ghatnaayen is tarah se nahin ghati jis tarah se krantikariyon ne chaha balki ghatnaon ne krantikariyon ko apana rasta badalane ke liye majaboor kiya
 If the other states had accepted the third state in the meeting of the States General, the trend of revolution would have been second
 isi prakaar aatank kaa rajya or diarectory ke shashan bhi suniyojit dhang se nahin chale
 From this point of view this revolution was chaotic
 francisi kranti ke mul main tatkaaleen francisi samaaj kii duravastha bhi ek mahatvapurn kaarak thi
 The whole society was divided into privileged and unprivileged classes
 krishakon kii sthiti karon ke boj se kharaab thi to duusari taraf unhen saamanton ke atyaachaar tathaa carch ke hastkshep se bhi shoshan kaa shikaar hona padataa tha
 These conditions led the revolution and the revolutionaries raised their voice against this inequality and gave the slogan of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke dauraan hi samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa hui, visheshadhikaron ko khatm kiya gaya
 The general public had participated in the French Revolution, but by ignoring their interests, the revolution took the form of totalitarianism in which the principles and wishes of any one person dominated
 vastutah kranti ke dauraan robspier ke netritv main ek taanaashaahee sarkaar yaa adhinayakatantr kii sthapana hui thi or aage chalakar nepalian ne bhi adhinayakatantr kii sthapana kii
 The French Revolution was a strong reaction against all the distortions, inconsistencies and fundamental faults prevailing in the ancient system
 kranti ne nirankush rajtantr asamanta par aadhaarit francisi samaaj, vilasitapurna padri varg tathaa aarthik diwaaliyepan ke sankat se jujh rahe kushasan kaa ant kar france main prajatantric shashan pranali kaa maarg prashast kiya
 From this point of view, it can be seen as a progressive revolution
 itnaa hi nahin maanavdhikaron kii ghoshnaa swatantraaa, samanta va bandhutav ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ko avgat karaayaa parinamswaroop vishwa ke kai deshon main raajnneetik adhikaron kii maang ko lekar janandolan hone lage
 The spirit of unification of Italy and Germany was encouraged
 dharm or raajnneeti ke pruthakkaran kaa mudda pehali baar is kranti ke dauraan uthaa
 State and politics were separated from religion
 vishwa itihaas main france kii rajya kranti ko vishisht mahatv praapt he yah maanav itihaas kii ek mahatvapurn ghatana maani jaati he
 In this, not only France, but also brought a priceless change in the life of Europe, in this, by destroying the feudal system that had been prevailing in the past, it gave way to modern democratic system
 rajtantr kii nirankushta samaapt hui or loktantric vaataavarna main logon ne chaiyn kii saans lee
 At this time, the question arises in front of us why the revolution in 1789 AD was not in other European countries but in France first
 18 veen shatabdi ke europe rashtron kaa adhyayan karne se gyaat hota he ki us samay france kii jo sthiti thi usase bhi badtar anya europe rashtron kii thi
 The autocratic monarchy was weighed down by the class with ease and the unbearable burden of taxes
 saadhaaran varg praaia: sabhi europe deshon main maujud the
 The condition of some states was more distorted than France, Prasha, Austria and Russia etc
 were also more distorted than France
 francisi krishak anya europe rashtron kii apeksha khushaal the
 The condition of the ordinary class was worse in other European states
 phir bhi kranti in deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi hui
 The main reason for this was that the French people were aware of their situation
 kranti ke liye yah koi aavashyak shart nahin ki iskaa visphot usee deshon main ho jahaan ke log atyaachaar, anachar or shoshan ke shikaar ho
 Revolution can also happen in a rich and advanced country
 basharte uske nivasee yah mahasus kare ki unke saath anyaay ho rahaa he
 The people of France were realizing this injustice
