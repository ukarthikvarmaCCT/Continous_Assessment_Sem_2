 The most important reason for the cheapness and cheapness of the progress in the city is the transportation of material from far-flung areas, such as sand is brought from 135 km away, while cement and sariya wagira is brought from Karachi 800 km away
 maujuuda guadar shahar sirf 800 meter lanbaa he jabaki master-plan ke mutabik aane vaale dinon main guadar taqariban 40 kilometre chaudaa or 60 kilometre lambaa hoga

 guadar free-port nahin balki tex-free zone shahar hoga
 While issuing the 'no Objection Letter', the GDA has made it clear to the private idars that they will arrange drinking water in their schemes and set up plants to clean the sea water, while the sewerage water Evacuation is also being arranged so that the dirty water does not get spoiled by joining the sea and surat-e-hall like Karachi is not born
 is maqasad ke liye har praivet skim ko bhi paband kiya he ki wo naalee ke pani ko saafe karne ke treetment or ricikaling plant lagaaen or is pani ko green-belt or parkon main istemaal kiya jaae
 Now the drinking water comes from the Aakra dam in Gwadar city, which was enough for the population of 45 thousand, but now due to the increase in the population, the water issue has arisen and the current water quantity has reduced because now the population of Gwadar is one lakh Is almost and will be enlarged in the coming days

 With the entry of Chinese into the city, the city's pride increased manifold

 bandargah chalaane ke liye tamaam buniyadi saamaan bhi lag chuke hai magar yahan par kaam isliye nahin ho paaya he ki duusare ilaaqon jaise madhya asia ke deshon ke liye sadaken maujuud nahin hai or is maqasad ke liye kai antarrashtriya mayaar kii sadaken banavaai ja rahi hai, masalan M8 rajmarg kii tamir par kaam shuru ho chukaa he jo taqariban 892 kilometre lambi motorve hogi jo guadar ko turabat, aawaran, kuzadaar or ratodero se milaaegi jo phir em 7, em 6 or inds hai-ve ke zariye guadar kaa china ke saath jamini rasta kaayam karne main madadgaar sabit hogi

 araajaktaa ek adarsh he jiskaa siddhant araajaktaavaad he
 Anarchism is the principle of efforts to establish justice in all human relations by ending the state by free and spontaneous cooperation between individuals, groups and nations
 araajaktaavaad ke anusaar kaarysvatantry jivan kaa gatyaatmak niyam he or isiilie uskaa mantavya he ki saamaajik sanghathan vyaktiyon ke kaary swatantry ke liye adhiktam avasar pradaan kare
 In human nature, there is such a power of self-regulation which can easily establish orderliness while remaining free from external control
 manushya par anushaasan kaa aropan hi saamaajik or naitik buraaiyon kaa janak he
 Therefore, the state and its other institutions dependent on violence cannot overcome these evils
 manushya swabhaavat: acha he, kintu ye sansthaayen manushya ko bhrasht kar detii hai
 Free from external control, the collective life of real freedom is possible mainly from small groups; Therefore the ideal of social organization is unionist
 suvyavasthit rup main araajaktaavaad ke siddhant ko sarvapratham pratipaadit karne kaa shrey stoik vichaardhaara ke pravarttak xeno ko he
 He emphasized on the establishment of a stateless society where absolute equality and freedom could develop the harmonies of human nature and establish universal harmony
 duusari shatabdi ke madhya main araajaktaavaad ke samyavaadee swaroop ke pravatrthak corpokreties ne rajya ke atirikt nijee sampatti ke bhi unmoolan kii baat kahi
 The ideas and organization of Christian philosophers and communities in the late medieval era expressed some clear anarchist tendencies, whose main claim was that one could be sin-free by establishing a direct mystic relationship with God
 aadhunik arth main vyavasthit dhang se araajaktaavaadi siddhant kaa pratipaadan wiliam godwin ne kiya jiske anusaar sarkaar or nijee sampatti ve do buraaiyaan hai jo maanav jati kii prakritik purnataa kii prapti main baadhak hai
 Government is a form of autocracy as a means of subordinating others and cruel property is a cruel injustice
 parantu godwin ne sabhi sampatti ko nahin, keval usee sampatti ko bura bataaya jo shoshan main sahaayak hoti he
 He rejected violent revolutionary means to establish an ideal social organization
 nyaay ke adarsh ke prachaar se hi vyakti main vah chetana laai ja sakati he jisase vah choti sthaneey ikaayiyon kii adarsh araajaktaavaadi prasanvidatmak vyavastha sthapit karne main sahyog de sake
 Subsequently two ideologies contributed to the development of anarchist theory in particular
 ek thi charam vyaktvaad kii vichaardhaara, jiskaa pratinidhitiv herbert spencer karte hai
 According to these thinkers, there is opposition to freedom and power and the state is not only inauspicious but also unnecessary
 kintu ye vichaarak nishchit rup se nijee sampatti ke unmoolan ke paksh main nahin the or na sangathit dharm ke hi viruddh the
 The second ideology was related to the philosophy of Fuerbach, which opposed organized religion and the ecological basis of the state
 fuarabaakh ke krantikari vichaaron ke anukool maiks starnar ne samaaj ko keval ek marichika bataaya tathaa dridhtaa se kaha ki manushya kaa apana vyaktitv hi ek aisi vaastaviktaa he jise janaa ja saktaa he
 All the rules that place limits on individuality are a hindrance to the healthy development of ego
 rajya ke sthaan par "ahanvaadiyon kaa sangh" ho to adarsh vyavastha main aarthik shoshan kaa unmoolan ho jayega, kyonki samaaj kaa pramukh utpaadan swatantra sahyog kaa pratifal hoga
 Regarding the revolution, he was of the view that a state dependent on violence can be eradicated only by violence
 araajaktaavaad ko jaagruk jan andolan banane kaa shrey prudhon ko he
 He opposed the monopoly of property and its unfair ownership
 adarsh saamaajik sanghathan vah he jo "vyavastha main swatantraaa tathaa ekta main swadhinata" pradaan kare
 To achieve this goal two fundamental revolutions are necessary: one should be conducted against the present economic system and the other should be against the present state
 parantu kisi bhi sthiti main kranti hinsaatmak na ho, varan vyakti kii aarthik swatantraaa tathaa uske naitik vikaas par jor diya jaae
 Ultimately, the Prudhs accepted that the state could not be completely abolished, so the main objective of anarchism should be to decentralize the functions of the state and reduce it as far as possible by independent collective life
 bakunin ne aadhunik araajaktaavaad main keval kuch nai pravritiyaan hi nahin jodin, varan use samashtivaadee swaroop bhi pradaan kiya
 He emphasized the collective ownership of land and other means of production, as well as private ownership of the goods consumed
 uske vichaar ke teen muladhar hai : araajaktaavaad, anishvarwad tathaa swatantra virgon ke bich swechha par aadhaarit sahyogita kaa siddhant
 As a result, he is opposed to state, church and personal property, these three institutions
 uske anusaar vartmaan samaaj do virgon main vibhajit he : sampann varg jiske haath main rajasatta rahati he, tathaa vipaz varg jo bhoomi, puunji or shiksha se vanchit rahakar pehle varg kii nirankushta ke adheen rahata he, isliye swatantraaa se bhi vanchit rahata he
 Achieving independence is mandatory for everyone in the society
 iske liye dusron ko adheen rakhanevaali har prakaar kii satta kaa bahishkaar karnaa hoga
 God and the kingdom are two such entities
 ek parloukik jagat main tathaa duusari loukik jagat main ucchtam satta ke siddhant par aadhaarit he
 The Church is the liturgy of the first doctrine
 isliye rajyavirohi kranti charchvirohi bhi ho
 Also, the state is always a source of private property, so this revolution should also be against private property
 kranti ke sambandh main bakunin ne hinsaatmak sadhano par apana vishwaas prakat kiya
 The main purpose of the revolution is stated to be the destruction of these three institutions, but nothing was said about the creation of a new society

 vinaashak yaa dhvasank - saamudrik / nausainik bhashaa main vinaashak pot teji se chal kar hamalaa karne vaale yuddh poton ko kaha jaataa hai
 They were invented in the early years of the 20th century and since then their place in the naval war has been unmatched
 bahumukhi or vishwasaneey kaaryon kaa daayitv safaltaapurvak vahan karne ke kaaran nausena ke itihaas main iskaa sthaan bejod ho gaya he
 Therefore, its past, present and future are worth studying
 yah nishchit he ki vinaashak kaa avishkaar tarpedo ke kaaran hua
 The torpedoes revolutionized the naval war
 yah pehla avasar tha jab tarpedo se las chota jahaaj vishaal nausena se morcha lekar use nasht kar saktaa tha
 The development of small ships became necessary with this revolutionary invention in the naval ecosystem
 iske do kaaran the : It is for these reasons that the destroyer was invented
 praarambhik dhvasankon main, jinhen "tarpedo naudhvasank' kehete the, keval do tarpedo nalikaay hoti thim
 They used to mount a cannon on the front to attack the enemy's destroyers
 ye jahaaj bahut chote, 200 se 300 ton visthaapan ke, hote the
 In order to increase the impact of the destroyer over time, it was considered necessary to carry more and more torpedoes
 tarpedo naliyon kii sankhya dhire-dhire badhati gai or dwitiya vishwayuddh ke samay tak do mouting par aath nalika ke rahane kaa maanvikaran hua
 As soon as the airplane entered the invasive shells, it was seen that the avalanche cannon on the destroyer was necessary to protect against air attacks
 prarambh main dhwansak par saamaanya mashinagan sthapit kii gai thi, par aisi choti topon main sanhaarshakti nahin hoti thi, at: baad main ubhay prayojan kii top sthapit kii gai
 When the submarine was developed, a further work was done on the destroyer
 vah tha, pandubbiyon kaa pataa lagaana or unka vinaash karnaa
 As a result, destructive submarine weapons were also carried
 isse dhwansak kaa aakaar or vistaar bad janaa swaabhaavik tha
 Before the First World War, where destroyers used to displace only 300 days of tons, today more than 2,000 tons of displacement have started becoming destroyers
 pichhali kuch dashabdiyon main vinaashkon main anek amul sudhaar hue hai, lekin isaki aadharbhoot visheshtao, jaise tej gati or yuddhayaskshmata main antar nahin hua he
 In the absence of high speed, there is less chance of the destroyers escaping when attacking large ships
 samudr main rakshit rahane inaki ascharyajanak kshamta inke suwahi aakaar or abhikalp ke kaaran he
 The weapons which remain in the destroyer can be divided into three categories: 1
 jahaajon par akraman karne ke liye tarpedo, 2
 The weapon for the attack on the submarine, 3
 vayuyan or choti-moti sthal senaaon se ladane ke liye ubhayprayojaneey topein
 As such, destructors are built only to attack large ships with torpedoes, however, the importance of torpedoes is gradually decreasing in modern naval war due to less chance of torpedo attack
 kintu aisa nahin kaha ja saktaa ki tarpedo akraman ke din ab lad chale
 Pursuers and returning torpedoes may return the day of the ship's torpedoes
 kuch logon ke kathananusaar pandubbi kaa itnaa vikaas ho chukaa he ki vinaashak dwaara use nasht nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Although this statement is true to some extent, close examination reveals that even today the destroyer is capable of killing the submarine
 pichley mahayuddh main vinaashkon ne 300 pandubbiyaan samudr main dubaa di thim
 Now even remote Lakshwedhi weapons and improved self-contained tips are available, which has greatly increased the potential of destroyers
 drone helicopter or rocket yukt pandubbimaar tarpedo ke kaaran pandubbiyon ko khojkar nasht karne kii kshamta vinaashkon main bahut bad gai he
 It was only natural for sea ships to increase the vulnerability of aircrafts as the crisis of air attacks increased
 kintu radar niyantrit or tatkshan prahaar karanevaali topein bhi paradhvanik aghati vayuyanon se raksha nahin kar saktin
 When a controlled missile is used in place of the cannon, as in the end, the destroyers will prevail as before
 dhwansak jahaji bede ke sarvaadhik vishwasaneey ang hai
 In the last World War, destroyers did all kinds of work
 inhone krithik dalon ko chhipaay, kaphilon ko anurakshit le gaye, praarambhik surveykshan dalon kaa parivahan kiya, jalsthaleey ghat ko chipa rakhaa, yuddh main hataahat logon ko bachaaya or dak vitaran kiya
 Also submerged about 300 submarines
 ye jal ke tal par bahut nikat sthit yupoton se lekar cruzaron, dhwanskon or petrol jalayanon se jujhe
 The future of destroyers seems bright
 bhavishya main ye vaahak krithik sen ke atyaavashyak ang honge
 These will strengthen air defense by substantially increasing the range of the combat operations and controlling the carrier air movement
 tej jahjon ko pandubbi se dhwansak hi bachaa saktaa he
 The best submarines will be unmatched in the hunt to find destroyers armed with weapons
 dhwansak aaj bhi saarth anurakshan kaary main atyadhik upyogi jahaaj siddh hry he
 How the future destroyers will be made can only be hypothesized, but keeping in view the modern inclination, this hypothesis will be very real
 bhavi dhwansak praaia: nishchit rup se newcleey shakti sanchalit hoga, kyonki newcleey shakti hi ekmaatr saadhan hogi, jisase dhwansak kii sahansheeltaa badhaai ja sakati he
 Tolerance of the destroyers will act of importance in the future, no doubt, as the task force may have to remain at sea for weeks
 dhwansak kii chaal bhi badhanaa aavashyak hoga
 a future destroyer can easily run at a speed of 50 knots
 tarpedo astr-shastron ko kam karnaa aavashyak hoga
 But submarine torpedoes may remain in the destroyer
 inamen rocket laga hoga, tarpedo main lagi lautanevaali sakriy yuktiyaan aisi hongi ki unhen shghrita se nalon main bharaa ja sake
 The cannons will have to be completely removed and replaced with floor-to-floor controlled missiles
 dhwanskon par drone helicopter bhi rahenge
 In summary, the work of destroyers with the latest types of submarine weapons, sophisticated search devices and controlled missile batteries will be very important in future warfare

 jin trakon ne rashtriya str par sabase zyada dhyaan aakarshith kiya ve the bob chandalar kaa bigafoot, averet jesmar kaa USA-1, fred shephar or jaik vilman siniar kaa beerfoot or jeff den kaa king kong
 us samay jo sabase bade tair kaa istemaal trakon main kiya ja rahaa tha uskaa vyas 48 inch tha
 In April 1981, Bob Chandler drove over cars in a field believed to be the first monster truck to crush cars
 chandalar ne trek kii kshamta kaa pareekshan karne ke liye use ek jodi kaaron ke upar se chalaaya or use apni chaar pahiyaa drive pradarshan dukaan main ek prachaar saadhan ke rup main upyog karne ke liye filmaaya

 After some minor celebrations, Chandler performed the feat at the Pontiac Silverdome in 1982
 is sho main, chandalar ne 66 inch vyas tair ke saath bigafoot ke ek nae sanskaran ke saath shuruyaat kii
 In the early 80s when Bigfoot was running on 48-inch Terra tires, Bob George, the owner of a motorsport promotion company called truck-a-rama, is said to have invented the name "monster Truck" when referring to Bigfoot 
 "monstor trek" shabd tab se vishaal terra tair vaale sabhi trakon ke liye saamaanya naam ban gaya
 Who did the job of crushing the car for the first time has often been debatable
 aisa daawa kiya jaataa he ki 1970 ke dashak ke uttarardh main, jeff den ke king kong ne union grove, visconsin main great lekes dragove par car ko kuchlaa tha
 Another truck, High Roller, is also said to have crushed cars in Washington State before Bigfoot, although the written evidence claimed never surfaced
 dikman bros ke swaamitv vaale saichlops ne bhi bigafoot se pehle jalati kaaren kuchalane kaa daawa kiya
 However, the earliest, widely available and verified video footage that exists and shows cars being crushed by monster trucks is Bob Chandler's Bigfoot, which he drove in April 1981 on two automobiles of the seventies
 yahi video tha jisane aayojakon ko prerit kiya or unhone chandalar ko darshakon ke saamne car ko kuchalane kaa pradarshan karne ke liye kaha
 King Kong and Bear Foot followed Bigfoot's 66 inch diameter tire and soon other monster trucks such as King Crunch, Maddog and Virginia Giant were built
 in aarambhik trakon ko stock chasis se banaaya gaya tha jinhen dubaara prabalit kiya gaya, usamen lif spring suspension, stock dhaancha or baari sainya dhuriyaan prayog kii gai
 As a result, these trucks were incredibly heavy and mostly had to crawl over cars
 1980 ke dashak ke adhikansh bhaag main, monstor trakon ne mukhya rup se pradarshaniyon main trek khinch yaa keechad khinchaav kaa hi pradarshan kiya
 In 1985, major organizers such as USHRA and TNT Motorsports began racing monster trucks regularly
 ye daud, ekal nirasan draig res ke rup main thi, jinhen baadhaon se bhare margon par yojit kiya jaataa tha
 The change of racing eventually prompted truck owners to start building more powered light trucks

 In 1988, the Monster Truck Racing Association was formed by Bob Chandler, Braden and George Carpenter to standardize regulations for truck construction and safety
 MTRA ne monstor trakon ko niyantrit karne ke liye maanak suraksha ke niyam banaae
 This organization still plays a major role in the development of sports in the USA and the European Union
 racing ke pramukh ban jane ke saath, kai tiimon ne yah sochna shuru kiya ki kaise trakon kaa nirmaan nae tareeke se kiya ja saktaa he
 In late 1988, Gary Cook and David Morris introduced the Equalizer, a major source of coil spring and hobby absorber suspension in this truck rather than leaf spring and hobby absorber
 1989 main, jaik vilman senior ne apane swayan ke toras trek ke saath ek nae trek kii shuruyaat kii jisamen for-link suspenson pranali or vishaal coyleover shauk absorbar laga hua tha or uskaa vazan kareeb 9000 pound tha
 But the real coup came from Chandler and in 1989, his Bigfoot VIII featured a clove-travel suspension with a cantilever and nitrogen hobby Absorber to control a full tubular chassis and suspension

 Although racing was effective as a competition, freestyle exhibitions began taking place at USHRA festivals since 1993
 These exhibitions developed when drivers, especially Dennis Anderson of the highly popular Grave Digger, asked for time to perform when he was out in the early stages of racing

 Following the Nebworth concert, the band purchased a section of a three-story church hall at 35 Britannia Row in Islington

 The size of the venue was also an issue; In Chicago, promoters claimed to have sold the 67,000 capacity of Soldier Field Stadium, but Waters and o'rourke were skeptical
 unhone ek helicopter, photographer or vakil, ko kaam par rakhaa or paaya ki vaastavik upasthiti 95,000 thi, jisase $640,000 dollar kii kami rahi
 The end of the tour infuriated Gilmour, who felt the band had achieved their original intended success and was no longer something they could hope for

 Meanwhile, in July 1977, Waters presented two new ideas to the band

 Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, the former was chosen for their next album

 The early sessions were emotionally fraught, as Ezrin, Guthrie and Waters had a clear idea of which direction the album would go; But Ezrin's role expanded as a middleman between Waters and the rest of the band's members

 Recording sessions were kept on a strict schedule set by Waters
 epirin ke saath unke rishte main khatas aa chuki thi, lekin rhite ke saath unka rishta puri tarah se tut chukaa tha
 The entire band rarely appeared together in the studio, and Wright, concerned about the impact the introduction of Ezrin had on the band's internal relationships, was keen to be credited as a producer on the album
 Waters agreed to a trial period, after which Wright would be credited with a producer, but a few weeks later both Waters and Ezrin expressed dissatisfaction with his manner
 rhite ne faltah din main studio aana band kar diya or keval raat main kaam karne lage
 Gilmour also expressed his annoyance, complaining that Wright's lack of direction was "driving us crazy"

 On Inside Out, Mason says that Waters called o'rourke, who was going to the US on QE2 and asked him to get Wright out of the band before Waters arrived in LA to mix the album

 He later spoke with Wright and gave him his support, but reminded him of his lack of contribution on the album

 After several days, distraught about his financial situation and failure in interpersonal relationships within the band, Wright left the band

 The animated scenes remained, but these scenes were played by professional actors without dialogue

 Gilmour requested Waters to reconsider his stand and reminded the bassist that he and other band members were shareholders and directors and could out-vote them for such a decision

 a socialist at heart, Waters viewed Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the islands as a tearing nationalism and unnecessary, and dedicated the new album - temporarily called Requiem for a post-war Dream - to her dead father

 tathaapi waters sashankit the, chunki gilmer ne pichley kuch varshon main band ke geeton ke liye kuch khaas yogadan nahin kiya tha

 Nonetheless, tensions within the band increased enormously
 waters or gilmer ne alag-alag kaam kiya, jo apane aap main asaamaanya nahin tha, lekin gilmer ko tanaav mahasoos hone laga, jo kabhi-kabhi mushkil se apane maansik santulan ko banaae rakh paa rahe the
 Waters also lost his temper and erupted over Kamen, who during a recording session bored repeatedly on a notepad in the studio control room, writing, "I Must Not Fuck Ship"
 Mason's contribution was minimal, as he engaged himself in recording the sound effects for an experimental new holophonic system that was to be used on the album
 antim takaraav ke baad, nirmaataa ke rup main gilmer kaa naam aabhaar suchi se nikaal diya gaya, jo waters ke hisaab se unke dwaara geet lekhan main nune yogadan ko darshaati he
 Mason kept himself away, having had his own marital problems by now, with wife Lindy
 I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy 


 but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut
 Hypnosis was isolated by this time, but Thorgerson was once again forgotten for cover design, and Waters decided to design it himself
 unke saale, vili christy ko album ke liye tasviren khinchne ke liye adhikrut kiya gaya
 The Final Cut was released in March 1983, going straight to # 1 in the UK and # 6 in the US
 "not Now John was released as a single where the chorus was" Fuck All That ", which was changed to" Stuff All That "

 o'rourke considered it his duty to inform Mason and Gilmour, and as a result, Waters tried to expel him
 To prevent Pink Floyd's name from ever being used again by anyone, Waters then went to the High Court

 gilmer kaa maananaa tha ki waters ne pink floid ke sheeghra ant ke liye use chhod diya, lekin baad main waters ne kaha ki nae album naa banaakar pink floid anubandh kaa ulanghan karegaa - jiskaa arth hoga ki railty bhugtan ko sthagit kar diya jayega - or unhen band dwaara prabhavi rup se majaboor kiya gaya tha chunki anya sadasyon ne un par mukadmaa kaayam karne kii dhamkee di
 With the case still pending, Waters fired o'rourke and hired Peter Rudge to manage his affairs

 usne suna tha ki ve nai saamagree par kaam kar rahe hai or poocha tha ki kya rhite isamen kuch yogadan kar sakate hai
 Gilmour considered the request; Wright had legal hurdles to rejoin the band, but was brought back after a meeting at Hampstead, although his contribution was minimal

 The album went straight to # 3 in the UK and the United States, preventing Michael Jackson from Bad and whitesnake's 1987 from reaching the top

 He sent a message through him that if Shivaji accepts the subjugation of Bijapur, the Sultan will give him the right to all the areas which are under Shivaji's control

 At the same time, due to the revolt of Siddijauhar in Karnataka, the Sultan of Bijapur entered into an agreement with Shivaji

 Shivaji will support the Mughals against Bijapur

 Against this, he showed his fury in the court and accused Aurangzeb of betrayal

 Aurangzeb intended to kill King Shivaji a few days later

 After the establishment of an independent Hindu nation in western Maharashtra, Shivaji wanted to crown his coronation, but Muslim soldiers threatened the Brahmins that whoever crowned Shivaji would be killed
 When this thing reached Shivaji that the Mughal Sardar is making such threats, then Shivaji took it as a challenge and said that now he will get anointed from the Brahmin of that state who is in the authority of the Mughals
 Shivaji's personal secretary Balaji sent three emissaries to Kashi, because Kashi was under the Mughal Empire
 When the messengers gave the message, the Brahmins of Kashi were quite pleased
 But the Mughal soldiers came to know about this and then caught those Brahmins
 But wisely those Brahmins told those messengers in front of the Mughal sannyko that we do not know who Shivaji is
 What line are they from? The messengers did not know that is why they said we do not know
 Then in front of the Sardar of the Mughal soldiers, those Brahmins said that we have to go somewhere else, from which clan Shivaji you have not told, so how can we crown him
 We are going on a pilgrimage and no other Brahmin will get the coronation until Kashika is fully introduced, so you can go back
 The Mughal Sardar was happy and left the Brahmins and thought of catching the messengers and sending them to Aurangzeb to Delhi, they too escaped silently
 After returning, he told this thing to Balaji Awa and Shivaji
 But surprisingly after two days the same Brahmin reached Raigad with his disciples and crowned Shivaji
 We are going on a pilgrimage and no other Brahmin will get the coronation until Kashika is fully introduced, so you can go back

 Seeing the demise of Aurangzeb King Shivaji at that time, with the desire to rule his whole India, he went out to conquer South India with his 500,000 army
 aurangzeb ne dakshin main atehi adilshaahi 2 dino main ore qutubashhi 1 hi dino main khatam kar di
 But the Marathas, under the leadership of King Sambhaji, maintained their independence while fighting for 9 years
 aurangzeb ke putr shahjada akbar ne aurangzeb ke kilaaf vidroh kar diya
 Sambhaji gave him shelter in his place
 aurangzeb ne ab phir joardaar tareeke se sambhaji ke kilaaf akraman karnaa shuru kiya
 Finally, in 1689, Sambhaji's wife's brother, Sambhaji, by the mouth of Ganji Shirke, made Sambhaji a prisoner by Mukarav Khan
 aurangzeb ne raja sambhaji se badasluki kii or bura haal kar ke maar diya
 Seeing his king being mistreated by Aurangzeb and badly hit, the Pura Maratha Swarajya became angry

 Rajaram died in 1700 AD

 Even though the relationship between astronomical mechanics and terrestrial dynamics was first revealed by Isaac Newton's discovery of the universal theory of gravity, the gravity of celestial bodies gives rise to their astrological effect, not stated by any scientific research, nor Some astrologers supported this

 According to skeptics, this method of western astrologers avoids making predictable estimates and gives them the ability to interpret important and arbitrary events as per their convenience
