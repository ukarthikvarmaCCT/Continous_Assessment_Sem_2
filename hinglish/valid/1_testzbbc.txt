 Pranayama = Prana + Dimension
 iskaa kaa shabdic arth he - 'praan ko lambaa karnaa' yaa 'praan ko lambaa karnaa'
 In the Hathayogapradipika it is said- yah bhi kaha gaya he- Pranayama is made up of the sum of two words - the first word is "prana" and the second is "dimension"
 praan kaa arth jo hamen shakti detaa he yaa bal detaa he
 To know the meaning of dimension, it has to be severed because it is made up of the sum of two words
 isamen mul shabd '"yam" ' he 'aa' upsarg laga he
 The meaning of yam is 'motion' and the prefix "aa" is used in the sense of 'inverted', that is, dimension means inversion
 atah pranayam main aayam ko 'ulataa gaman ke arth main prayog kiya gaya he
 Thus Pranayama means' the reverse movement of Prana
 yahan yah dhyaan dene ki baat he ki pranayam praan ke ulataa gaman ke vishesh kriya kii sangya he na ki uskaa parinaam
 That is to say, the word pranayama should indicate the specific action of life

 According to this sutra, for doing pranayama, first of all there should be a proper interpretation of the sutra, but before interpreting the pranayama sutra of Patanjali, we should note that Patanjali compiled the activities and upanayas of yoga in a book called Yogasutra
 Has done and the meaning of the formula is - a certain rule which is mathematic and scientific
 yadi sutara kii sahi vyakhya nahin hui to uttar satya se dur evam parinaam shunya hoga
 If you want to do pranayam according to Patanjali's pranayama sutra, then first of all, his pranayama sutra tasmin sati svasprashapyayogaartivakshya: pranayamaà¥¥ There should be a proper interpretation that is scriptural, scientific, logical, and mathematical

 The breath that we draw in the lungs is not just breathing, it contains all the energy of the whole universe
 maan lo jo saans aapke puure sharir ko chalaanaa janati he, wo aapke sharir ko durust karne kii bhi takat rakhti he
 Pranayama should be done with the following chant

 Fill the long breath in the lungs with the nose, then leave the long breath through the lungs
 Keep the same pressure while breathing and exhale
 hamen hamaari galtiyaan sudharni he, ek to ham puri saans nahin lete; or doosraa hamaari saans pet main chali jaati he
 See there are two ways in our body, one and the other
 Just as the lungs have a system of purifying the air, the stomach does not
 usee ke kaaran hamaare sharir main oxygen kii kami mahasoos hoti he or usee ke kaaran hamaare sharir main rog judate he
 Sit in Sukhasana, Siddhasana, Padmasana, Vajrasana and while throwing the breath out, you have to push the stomach inward, just keep breathing in it

 While doing Kapalbhati Pranayama one has to focus on the Muladhara Chakra
 isse muladhar chakra jaagrath ho kar kundlini shakti jaagrath hone main madad hoti he
 While doing Kapalabhati Pranayama, it is to think that all the negative elements of our body are going out of the body

 2) uddyaan bandh :- pet ko puri tarah andar peeth kii taraf kheenchna he
 3) Basic bandage: - The place of excretion of our feces has to be pulled completely upwards
 sukhasana, siddhasana, padmasana, vajrasana main baithen
 The beginning and the end always have to be done with the left nostril, close the right nostril of the nose and take a long breath from the left, then close the left, exhale long breath from the right one


 Now take a long breath from the right and leave the left one
 


 That is, keep this sequence right-to-left-left, repeat this process for 10-15 minutes
 While breathing, you should concentrate on the command cycle located between the two eyes

 Sir, i have come to the conclusion after continuous practice of the last five years: - If you start breathing in the Anulom Antonym Pranayama, if you start breathing from right nostril and finally from right nostril then anger and irritation persists in the mind! And conversely, if the breath is started from the left nostril and at the end the breath is exhaled from the left nostril then the mind remains calm! sukhasana, siddhasana, padmasana, vajrasana main baithen
 And with the mother-in-law, you have to chant Oum with your mouth

 Template: Evolution3 The study of pairwise-variant frequency distributions and changes in the effects of four main evolutionary processes: natural selection, genetic predisposition, mutation and gene-flow is called population genetics
 isamen jansankhya up-vibhaajan tathaa jansankhya sanrachana ke karkon par bhi dhyaan diya jaataa he
 It also attempts to explain concepts such as adaptation and characterization

 jansankhya anuvanshiki jansankhyaon kii genetic banaavat par tathaa is baat ke adhyayan par dhyaan kendrit karti he ki yah banaavat samay ke saath kis prakaar badalati he
 a population is a set of organisms, in which any group of members can breed among themselves
 isamen yah antarnihit he ki sabhi sadsy ek hi prajati ke hote hai tathaa ek duusare ke aas-paas hi nivas karte hai
 For example, all moths of the same species living in a forest are a population
 is jansankhya main upasthit kisi jin ke vibhinn vaikalpik rup ho sakate hai, jo jeevon ke phenotip ke bich vividhtaon ko spasht karata he
 An example of this may be a gene responsible for the determination of color in kites, which consists of two alleles: black and white
 The entire set of pair choices for a gene in a single population is called a gene pool; The allele frequency for a pair option is the portion of the genes in that pool that consists of that pair option
 Development occurs when there is a change in the frequencies of pair choices within a population of hybrid organisms; For example, in a population of kites, the allele responsible for black color is becoming more common
 kisi jansankhya ke vikaas kaa kaaran banane vaali kaarividhi ko samajhane ke liye, is baat par vichaar karnaa upyogi he ki kisi jansankhya kaa vikaas na hone ke liye kin sthitiyon kaa hona aavashyak he
 According to the Hardy â Weinberg theory, the frequency of pair-choices in a sufficiently large population will remain constant if random swapping of pair-choices during erection of semen or eggs, and those pair-cells in these sex cells during fertilization
 Random combination of substitutes is the only power acting on that population
 aisi jansankhya ko hardi-vinberg samatulyata main mana jaataa he kyonki iskaa vikaas nahin ho rahaa he
 According to the Hardy â Weinberg theory, both allele and genotype frequencies in a population remain constant from generation to generation â that is, they are in a state of equilibrium â as long as there are specific effects that cause interference
 Do not come
 Outside the laboratory, one or more of these "disturbing effects" are always effective
 hardi vinberg samatulyata prakruti main asambhav hoti he
 Genetic equivalence is the ideal state to provide a baseline on which genetic change can be measured
 kisi jansankhya main yugma-vikalpiyon kii aavritiyaan pidiyon tak sthir baniin rahati hai, yadi nimnlikhit sharton kaa paalan kiya ja rahaa ho: yadrichhik sahavaas, koi utparivartan na hona, koi pravasan yaa utpravas na hona, jansankhya kaa bahut bada aakaar or kisi bhi lakshan ke samarthan yaa virodh main koi chaynaatmak dabaav na hona
 In the simplest case of a single gene locus with two alleles: dominant alleles are denoted by a and ineffective alleles are denoted by a and their frequencies are represented by p and q; freq = p; freq = q; p + q = 1
 If the population is in equilibrium, then we get freq = p 2 for AA homozygos in the population, freq = q 2 for aa homozygos, and freq = 2pq for heterozygous
 in samikarnon ke aadhaar par ek jansankhya ke bare main upyogi, lekin maapne-main-kathin tathyon kaa nirdhaaran kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, a patient's progeny is the carrier of an ineffective mutation that causes cystic fibrosis in homozygous recessive children
 abhibhavak yah jaananaa chaahati hai ki unke poton dwaara vanshanukram se is beemaari ko grahan kiye jane kii kitni sambhaavna he
 To answer this question, the genetic counselor must be aware of the possibility that the child will cohabit with an carrier of ineffective mutation
 sambhav he ki yah tathy gyaat na ho, parantu beemaari kii aavriti gyaat ho
 We know that the disease is caused by homozygous recessive genotypes; Therefore, we can use the Hardy â Weinberg principle to go back from the origin of the disease to the frequency of heterozygous ineffective individuals
 saanchaa:genetic genealogy The mathematics of population genetics was originally developed as a part of modern evolutionary synthesis
 betty ke anusaar, yah aadhunik sanshleshan ke mul ko paribhaashit karata he
 According to Lewontin, the theoretical work of population genetics is a process of two gaps: a "genotypic interval" and a "phenotypic interval"
 The challenge to a complete theory of population genetics is to provide a set of rules that can predict a population with a genotype to be predetermined with the phenotype where it is selected, and another set of rules that match the resulting population
 Again with genotypes, where the next generation of genotypes can be predicted by Mendelian genetics and thus Cycle is completed
 ek kshan ke liye yadi ham anvik anuvanshiki ke gaiyr-mendeleey pahaluon ko ek ore rakh den, to bhi spasht rup se yah ek vishaal kaary he
 On seeing this conversion as planned: 1974, prishth+ 12 se anukulit)
 eksdi T1 represents genetic and epigenetic regulations, aspects of functional biology, or evolution, that convert a genotype into a phenotype
 ham iskaa ullekh "genotip-phenotip maanchitr" ke rup main karenge
 t 2 is a conversion caused by natural selection, t 3 is epigenetic relationships, which predict genotypes based on the selected phenotype, and ultimately t 4 the laws of Mendelian genetics
 vyavhaar main, vikasmoolak siddhant ke do bhaag hai, jo ek duusare ke samanaantar hai, genotip antaraal main karyrat paaramparik jansankhya anuvanshiki or vanaspatiyon tathaa pashuon ke prajnan main prayukt biometric siddhant, jo phenotip antaraal main karyrat he
 Here the mapping between genotype and phenotype interval is absent
 iskaa kaaran "haath kii safai" he, jiske dwaara ek kshetra kii parivartaneey vastuon ko maapdand yaa sthir vasteen mana jaataa he, jahaan, ek purna-vyavhaar main, ve vikasmoolak prakriya ke dwaara swatah hi roopantarit ho jaaenge or vaastaviktaa main ve kisi anya kshetra kii avasthaa ko parivartit karanevaale kaary hai
 In this "sleight of hand" it is assumed that we know this mapping
 aisa maan lenaa ki ham ise samaj rahe hai, hamaari ruchi ke anek maamalon kaa vishleshan karne ke liye paryaapt he
 For example, if the phenotype is nearly one-to-one with the genotype or the time-measure is sufficiently brief, "stationary objects" can be accepted as they exist; However, in many cases it is also wrong to do so
 prakritik chayan vah prakriya he, jiske dwaara kisi jeev ke astitv or safal prajnan kii sambhaavna ko badhaane vaale vanshanukramik lakshan kisi jansankhya kii aane vaali pidiyon main adhik aam ban jate hai
 Natural genetic diversity within a population of organisms means that some organisms will survive more successfully than other organisms in the current environment
 This issue was developed by Charles Darwin in his ideas of gender selection that factors influencing reproductive success Are also important
 prakritik chayan phenotip par, yaa jeev ke dekhe ja sakane vaale lakshanon par kaary karata he, lekin kisi bhi phenotip kaa anuvaanshik aadhaar, jo ki prajnan kaa laabh pradaan karata he, ek jansankhya main adhik aam ban jayega 
 samay ke saath-saath, is prakriya kaa parinaam kisi vishisht paristhitik awaas ke anukoolnon ke rup main mil saktaa he or antat iske parinamswaroop ek nai prajati kaa janm bhi ho saktaa he
 Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology
 yah nai shabdaawalee charles darwin ne 1859 kii apni abhootpurv pustak on da origin of spishiz main prastut kii thi, jisamen prakritik chayan kaa varnan kritrim chayan, ek prakriya jiske antargat pashuon va vanaspatiyon ko unke manushya prajnakon dwaara vaanchit lakshanon ke dwaara prajnan ke liye vyavasthit dhang se samarthan diya jaataa he, ke saath isaki tulana ke dwaara kiya gaya tha
 The concept of natural selection was originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; At the time of Darwin's writing, there was no information about modern genetics
 darvinian vikaas tathaa iske baad paaramparik or anvik anuvanshiki main hui khojon ke aapasi sangyojan ko hi aadhunik vikasaatmak sanshleshan kaha jaataa he
 Natural selection remains the main cause of adaptive development
 anuvaanshik jhukaav us saapeksh aavriti main hone vaala antar he, jisamen kisi jin kaa ek anya rup yadrichhik sampling or avasar ke kaaran kisi jansankhya main utpann hota he
 That is, the pairs of alleles present in subsequent generations in the population are a random sample of the pairwise alternatives present in their parents
 or is baat ke nirdhaaran main avasar kii bhoomika hoti he ki kya kisi vishisht jeev kaa astitv bachaa rahegaa or vah prajnan karegaa
 The allele frequency of a population is the fraction or percentage of its gene copies compared to the total number of gene alleles sharing a specific variant
 anuvaanshik jhukaav ek mahatvapurn vikasaatmak prakriya he, jiske parinamswaroop samay ke saath-saath yugma-vikalpi aavritiyon main parivartan hote hai
 Because of this, any variation of the gene can also be completely eliminated, which reduces genetic variability
 prakritik chayan, jo jin ke vividh roopon ko prajnan main unki safalataa ke aadhaar par adhik aam yaa kam aam banaata he, ke vipareet anuvaanshik jhukaav ke kaaran hone vaale parivartan vaataavaran ke yaa anukulan ke dabaavon dwaara sanchalit nahin hote or ve prajnan kii safalataa ke prati laabhadaayak, tatasth yaa hanikaarak bhi ho sakate hai
 The effect of genetic predation is large in small populations and small in large populations
 prakritik chayan kii tulana main anuvaanshik jhukaav ke mahatv ko lekar vaigyanikon ke bich joardaar bahes jari he
 Ronald Fisher's view is that genetic predisposition plays a negligible role in development and this approach has been effective for many decades
 san 1968 main motu kimura ne anvik vikaas ke tatasth siddhant, jisamen daawa kiya gaya he ki anuvaanshik saamagree main hone vaale adhikansh parivartan anuvaanshik jhukaav ke kaaran hote hai, ke dwaara is bahes ko punah shuru kar diya
 Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome and are caused by radiation, viruses, transposon, and mutant chemicals, as well as errors that occur during meiosis or DNA replication
 trutiyaan aksar diene pratilipikaran kii prakriya ke dauraan, duusare reshe ke bahulkikaran main, utpann hoti hai
 These errors can also be caused by the organism itself by cellular processes such as over-mutation
 utparivartan kisi jeev ke phenotip par prabhaav daal sakate hai, vishesh rup se yadi ve kisi jin ke protein koding kram ke bheetar utpann hote hai
 The rate of errors is generally very low due to the "proofreading" ability of DNA polymerase
 prufreeding ke bina, trutiyon kii daren isse hazaar guna adhik hoti hai
 Chemical damage in DNA also occurs naturally and cells use a DNA correction procedure to correct this breakage and mis-match in DNA
 iske baavjood, kabhi-kabhi yah sudhaar diene ko iske mul kram main waapas laane main vifal rahata he
 Mutations can also occur due to errors in alignment during meiosis, in organisms that use chromosomal changes to exchange DNA and recombine genes
 badlaav main hone vaali trutiyaan utpann hone kii sambhaavna tab hoti he, jab ek jaise kram apane sahabhaagi gun-sutron ko galat sanrekhan apnaane par baadhya karte hai; iske kaaran jinom ke kuch kshetra is prakaar hone vaale utparivartan ke prati adhik samvedansheel ban jate hai
 These errors produce large structural changes in the DNA sequence â the duplication, reversal or deletion of the entire region, or the erroneous interchange of entire parts between different properties
 utparivartan ke kaaran diene kram main vibhinn prakaar ke anek parivartan ho sakate hai; sambhav he ki inkaa koi prabhaav na ho, yaa ye ek jin ke utpaada ko parivartit kar den yaa ye jin ko kaary karne se roak den
 In a study on a fly called Drosophila melanogaster, it was found that if a mutation alters a protein produced by a gene, it will probably be harmful because the effect of about 70 percent of this mutation would be harmful and the rest would be either neutral
 Will be or will be very less profitable
 koshikaon par in utparivartanon ke sambhavit hanikaarak prabhaavon ke kaaran, jeevon ne utparivartanon ko dur karne ke liye diene sudhaar jaisi kaarividhiyaan viksit kar leen hai
 Therefore, the optimal rate of mutation between species is between the costs of high mutation rates, such as malignant mutations, and the metabolic costs of maintaining systems, such as DNA repair enzymes, to reduce mutation rates
 apane anuvaanshik padaarth ke rup main arene kaa prayog karne vaale vishaanuon main utparivartan kii daren teevr hoti hai, jisase laabh ho saktaa he kyonki ye vishaanu lagaataar tathaa teevr gati se viksit honge or is prakaar, udaahranarth maanviya pratiraksha tantra kii, rakshaatmak pratikriya se batch niklenge
 Mutations may involve duplication of large portions of DNA, most commonly through genetic recombination
 ye doharaav naye jeenon ke nirmaan ke liye kachche maal kaa ek mukhya strot hai or prati das lakh varshon main pashu jinom main dasiyon se saikadon jeenon ko pratilipit kiya jaataa he

 Here, regions act as segments, each of which has a distinct and independent function, and can be combined together to produce genes encoding new proteins with new properties
 udhaaharan ke liye, manushya kii aankh prakaash ko pahchaan paane vaali sanrachana kaa nirmaan karne ke liye chaar jeenon kaa prayog karti he: teen rangeen drushti ke liye or ek ratrikalin drushti ke liye; ye chaaron ek hi purvaj jin se utpann hote hai
 Another advantage of copying a gene is that it increases redundancy; This allows one gene of the pair to adopt a new function, while the other copy continues the original function
 utparivartan ke anya prakaar aksar purv main koding na kiye gayi diene se naye jin kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Gene flow is interchangeable between populations, which are often the same species

 Since the creation of new species of populations requires barriers to reproduction between two dispersed populations, gene flow can slow this process by spreading genetic differences between populations
 parvat-shrinkhalaaon, mahasaagaron or registaanon yaa yahaan tak ki maanav-nirmit sanrachanaon, jaise china kii vishaal diwaar, jisane vanaspati ke jeenon ke pravaah ko roak diya, jin pravaah main avrodh utpann karte hai
 Depending on how far the two species have drifted away from their most recent common ancestor, it may still be possible for them to produce their offspring, such as breeding mules from horses and donkeys

 The importance of hybridization in the creation of new species of animals is unclear, however, its cases have been seen in many types of animals, and the gray tree frog is a typical example of this, which has been very well studied
 tathaapi sankaran vanaspatiyon main prajatikaran kaa ek mahatvapurn madhyam he, kyonki pashuon kii tulana main vanaspatiyon dwaara poliploidi ko adhik sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 Polyploidy is important in hybridizations because it allows reproduction in which each of the two different sets of chromosomes is able to pair with a homologous partner during meiosis
 poliploid jeevon main adhik anuvaanshik vividhta bhi hoti he, jiske kaaran ve choti jansankhyaon main antah prajnan ke dabaav se bache rah sakate hai
 Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another that is not its progeny; It is most common in bacteria
 chikitsa ke kshetra main, yah antibiotic ke prati pratirodh ke vistaar main yogadan karata ham kyonki jab ek jeevanu pratirodhi jin praapt kar letaa he, to vah tezi se unhen duusari prajatiyon tak sthanantarit kar saktaa he
 Horizontal transfer of genes may also have occurred from bacteria to eukaryote organisms, such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the Azuki bean bumblebee Callosobruchus chinensis
 bade paimaane par hue sthanantaranon kaa ek udhaaharan eukereotic deloid rotifer hai, jinhone shaayad jeevanuon, kavakon tathaa vanaspatiyon se jeenon kii ek shrinkhalaa praapt kii he
 Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms, causing the transfer of genes between biological regions as well
 chloroplast va mitocondria ke adhigrahan ke dauraan eukeriotic koshikaon tathaa prokeriot jeevon ke bich bhi bade paimaane par jin sthanantaran ho saktaa he
 Gene flow is the transfer of alleles from one population to another
 kisi ek jansankhya ke bheetar yaa usase baahar pravaasana yugma-vikalpi aavritiyon main ek lakshaneey parivartan ke liye uttaradaayi ho saktaa he
 Immigration can also result in new genetic variants added to the established gene pool of a specific species or population
 vibhinn jansankhyaon ke bich jin pravaah kii dar ko prabhavit karne vaale anek kaarak hai
 One of the most important factors is mobility, because the higher the mobility of the organism, the higher its migration probability
 pashuon kii gatishiltaa vanaspatiyon se adhik hoti he, haalanki paraag-kan or bich pashuon yaa hawa ke dwaara bahut lambii duriyon tak le jaye ja sakate hai
 Maintained gene flow between two populations can also result in a combination of two gene pools, leading to a decrease in genetic diversity between the two groups
 yahi kaaran he ki in samoohon ke jin pulon kaa punarsangyojan karke or is prakaar anuvaanshik vividhta, jiske parinamswaroop purna prajatikaran tathaa maadaa prajatiyon kaa nirmaan hua hota, main antar viksit karke jin pravaah prajatikaran ke khilaaf dridhtaa se kaary karata he
 For example, if a species of grass develops on both sides of a roadway, it is likely that the pollen will move from one side to the other or vice versa
 yadi yah paraag-kan apane gantavy par praapt hone vaale paudhe ko nishechit karne tathaa ek vardhanksham santan utpann kar paane main sakasham he, to us paraag-kan ke yugma-vikalpi sadak ke ek ore kii jansankhya se duusari ore ja paane main prabhavi rup se sakasham sabit hue hai
 Due to the physical barriers to migration, as well as limited moving capacity, and birth phylopatry, it is rare for natural populations to be panmictic
 There is usually a geographical range within which organisms living are more closely related to each other than to randomly selected organisms from a general population

 Jawaharlal Nehru was the first Prime Minister of India and a central figure in Indian politics before and after independence
 mahatma gandhi ke sangrakshan main, ve bhartiya swatantrata aandolan ke sarvocch netaa ke rup main ubhare or unhone 1947 main bharat ke ek swatantra raashtra ke rup main sthapana se lekar 1964 tak apane nidhan tak, bharat kaa shashan kiya
 He is considered the architect of the modern Indian nation-state - a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic
 kashmiri pandit samudaay ke saath unke mul kii vajah se ve pandit nehru bhi bulaayen jate the, jabaki bhartiya bachche unhen chachaa nehru ke rup main jaanate hai
 Nehru was elected by the Congress to hold the post of the first Prime Minister of independent India, although the question of leadership was settled long back in 1941, when Gandhiji acknowledged Nehru as his political heir and successor
 pradhanmantri ke rup main, ve bharat ke sapane ko saakaar karne ke liye chal pade
 The Constitution of India was enacted in 1950, after which he launched an ambitious plan of economic, social and political reforms
 mukhyatah, ek bahuvachani, bahu-daleey loktantr ko poshit karte huen, unhone bharat ke ek upnivesh se ganraajya main parivartan hone kaa paryvekshan kiya
 In foreign policy, portraying India as a regional hero in South Asia, he played a leading role in the non-absolutist movement
 nehru ke netritv main, congress rashtriya or rajya-stareey chunaavon main prabhutv dikhaate huen or 1951, 1957, or 1962 ke lagaataar chunaav jitate huen, ek sarv-grahan party ke rup main ubhari
 Despite political troubles in his last years and the failure of his leadership in the 1962 chinese-india War, he remained popular among the people of India
 bharat main, unka janmdin bal diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa hai
 Jawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad, British India
 unke pita, motilal nehru, ek dhani barrister jo kashmiri pandit samudaay se the, swatantrata sangram ke dauraan bhartiya rashtriya congress ke do baar adhyaksh chune gaye
 His mother Swarooprani Thusu, from a well-known Kashmiri Brahmin family settled in Lahore, was Motilal's second wife and the first wife died during childbirth
 jawaharlal teen bacchon main se sabase bade the, jinamein baaki do ladkiyaan thi
 The elder sister, Vijaya Lakshmi, later became the first woman president of the United Nations General Assembly
 sabase choti bahan, krishna hathising, ek ullekhneey lekhika bani or unhone apane parivaar-janon se sambandhit kai pustaken likhin
 Jawaharlal Nehru was educated in some of the best schools and universities in the world
 unhone apni schuli shiksha hero se or college kii shiksha trinity college, cambridge se puri kii thi
 He then completed his law degree from Cambridge University
 england main unhone saat saal vyateet kiye jisamen vahaan ke fabian samaajwaad or irish rashtrawaad ke liye ek tarksangat drushtikon viksit kiya
 Jawaharlal Nehru returned to India in 1912 and started advocacy
 1916 main unki shaadi kamala nehru se hui
 Jawaharlal Nehru joined the Home Rule League in 1917
 raajnneeti main unki asli diksha do saal baad 1919 main hui jab ve mahatma gandhi ke sampark main aae
 At that time Mahatma Gandhi launched a campaign against the Rowlatt Act
 nehru, mahatma gandhi ke sakriy lekin shantipurna, savinay avagya andolan ke prati khaase aakarshith hue
 Nehru also adapted his family according to the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi
 jawaharlal or motilal nehru ne pashchimi kapadon or mahangi sampatti kaa tyaag kar diya
 He now started wearing a Khadi kurta and Gandhi cap
 jawahar laal nehru ne 1920-1922 main asahyog andolan main sakriy hissaa liya or is dauraan pehali baar giraftaar kiye gaye
 He was released after a few months
 jawaharlal nehru 1924 main elahabaad nagar nigam ke adhyaksh chune gaye or unhone shahar ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari ke rup main do varsh tak seva kii
 He resigned in 1926 citing lack of cooperation from the British authorities
 1926 se 1928 tak, jawahar laal nehru ne akhil bhartiya congress samiti ke mahasachiv ke rup main seva kii
 In 1928-29, the annual session of the Congress was held under the chairmanship of Motilal Nehru
 us satr main jawaharlal nehru or subhash chandra bose ne puri raajnneetik swatantraaa kii maang kaa samarthan kiya, jabaki motilal nehru or anya netaaon ne british samrajya ke bheetar hi prabhutv sampann rajya kaa darja paane kii maang kaa samarthan kiya
 To resolve the issue, Gandhi took a middle ground and said that Britain would be given two years to grant the status of the state of India and if it did not, the Congress would launch a national struggle for complete political independence
 nehru or bose ne maang kii ki is samay ko kam kar ke ek saal kar diya jaae
 The British government did not respond to this
 disambar 1929 main, congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan lahore main yojit kiya gaya jisamen jawaharlal nehru congress party ke adhyaksh chune gaye
 During this session, a resolution was also passed demanding 'complete self-rule'
 26 janvari 1930 ko lahore main jawaharlal nehru ne swatantra bharat kaa jhanda fahraaya
 Gandhiji also called for the Civil Disobedience Movement in 1930
 andolan khaasaa safal rahaa or isane british sarkaar ko pramukh raajnneetik sudhaaron kii aavashyaktaa ko sweekaar karne ke liye majaboor kar diya
 When the British Government promulgated the India Act 1935, the Congress Party decided to contest elections
 nehru chunaav ke baahar rahe lekin zoron ke saath party ke liye rashtravyapee abhiyaan chalaaya
 The Congress formed governments in almost every province and won the largest number of seats in the Central Assembly
 nehru congress ke adhyaksh pad ke liye 1936 or 1937 main chune gaye the
 He was also arrested during the Quit India Movement in 1942 and released in 1945
 1947 main bharat or pakistan kii aazaadee ke samay unhone angreji sarkaar ke saath hui vaartaon main mahatvapurn bhagidaari kii
 When India got independence in 1947, when the Congress voted for the future Prime Minister, Sardar Patel got the most votes
 uske baad sarvaadhik mat acharya kriplani ko mili the
 But at the behest of Gandhiji, Sardar Patel and Acharya Kripalani withdrew their names and Jawaharlal Nehru was made the Prime Minister
 1947 main ve swatantra bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri bane
 The British had liberated around 500 princely states together and the biggest challenge at that time was to bring them under one flag
 unhone bharat ke punargathan ke raste main ubhari har chunauti kaa samajhadaari purvak saamana kiya
 Jawaharlal Nehru played an important role in the making of modern India
 unhone yojana ayog kaa gathan kiya, vigyaan or praudyogiki ke vikaas ko protsaahit kiya or teen lagaataar panchavarshiya yojanaon kaa shubharambh kiya
 Due to their policies, a new era of agriculture and industry started in the country
 nehru ne bharat kii videsh niti ke vikaas main ek pramukh bhoomika nibhaai
 Jawaharlal Nehru, together with Josip Burrows Tito and Abdul Gamal Nasir, created a non-aligned movement for the elimination of colonialism in Asia and Africa
 vah korian yuddh kaa ant karne, suez nahar vivaad sulajhane or congou samjhaute ko murtarup dene jaise anya antarrashtriya samasyaon ke samaadhaan main madhyasth kii bhoomika main rahe
 He also contributed significantly behind the scenes in resolving many other explosive issues like West Berlin, Austria and Laos
 unhen varsh 1955 main bharat ratna se sammanit kiya gaya
 But Nehru could not improve India's relations with Pakistan and China
 pakistan ke saath ek samjhaute tak pahunchne main kashmir mudda or china ke saath mitrataa main seemaa vivaad raste ke pathar sabit hue
 Nehru also extended a hand of friendship towards China, but in 1962, China attacked by deception
 nehru ke liye yah ek bada jhatka tha or shaayad unki maut bhi isi kaaran hui
 On 27 May 1964, Jawaharlal Nehru suffered a heart attack in which he died
 bahut se logon kaa vichaar he ki nehru ne anya netaaon kii tulana main bharat ke swatantrata sangram main bahut kam yogadan diya tha phir bhi gandhiji ne unhe bharat kaa pratham pradhanmantri bana diya
 For several decades after independence, the heirs of power in Indian democracy have run a monarchy in the country from time to time, revered individual worship in place of ideology and completely neglected the public interest while indulging in the aura of so-called popularity
 nehru ko mahatma gandhi ke raajnneetik uttaradhikari ke taur janaa jaataa he
 It is also alleged on Gandhi that he did the work of advancing Nehru in politics at the expense of many able leaders including Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 jab aazaadee ke thik pehle congress adhyaksh banane kii baat thi or mana ja rahaa tha ki jo congress adhyaksh banegaa vahi aaazaad bharat kaa pehla pradhanmantri hoga tab bhi gandhi ne pradesh congress samitiyon kii siforeeshon ko andekha karte hue nehru ko hi adhyaksh banane kii disha main safaltaapurvak prayaas kiya
 This creates a general belief that Nehru must have not only done the work of advancing the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi but he must have tried his best to complete the tasks which Gandhi himself could not complete
 lekin sachai iske ulat he
 It was none other than Jayaprakash Narayan, who once worked as a team with Nehru, in the role of 1978 book 'gandhi Today'
 jepi ne nehru ke bare main kuch kaha he to uski vishwasaneeyata ko lekar koi andeh nahin hona chahie kyonki nehru se jepi kii najdiki bhi thi or mitrataa bhi
 Despite this, JP highlighted the shortcomings of the Nehru model
 april 2015 main yah bhi khulaasa hua ki swatantraaa ke baad nehru ne bees varshon tak ibi dwaara netaji ke sambandhiyon kii jasusi karaayi
 Away from all political controversies, Nehru was undoubtedly a good writer
 raajnneetik kshetra main lokmaanya tilak ke baad jam kar likhane vaale netaaon main ve alag se pahachaane jate hai
 The areas of both are different, but there is a considerable amount of consistency in the writing of both
 nehru ji swabhaav se hi swadhyaayi the
 He studied great texts
 sabhi rajnatik uttejnaaon ke baavjood ve swadhyay ke liye roj hi samay nikaal liya karte the
 As a result, the books composed by him also give a simple feeling of being the creation of a study-able person
 nehru ji ne vyavasthit rup se anek pustakon kii rachana kii he
 The solution to the extreme lack of time for writing in the busiest struggling days of political life was to make the long dull days of jail a creative one
 isliye unki adhikansh pustaken jail main hi likhi gayi hai
 In his writings, a mixed form of the spirit of a litterateur and the searching heart of a historian has emerged
 indira gandhi ko kaalpanik patr likhane ke bahaane unhone vishwa itihaas kaa adhyay-dar-adhyay likh daalaa
 These letters were never actually sent, but by this, a simple communicative and well-written text like a glimpse of world history was easily prepared
 bharat kii khoj ne lokapriyata ke alag pratimaan rache hai, jis par aadhaarit bharat ek khoj naam se ek uttam dharawahik kaa nirmaan bhi hua he
 His autobiography About my story, the well-known Manishi Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan believes that his autobiography, which narrates the story of his life and struggle without trying to prove self-pity or moral superiority, is one of the most notable books of our era
 Is one of in pustakon ke atirikt nehru ji ne aganit vyaakhyaan diye, lekh likhe tathaa patr likhe
 For their publication, 'jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund' decided to publish a bibliography
 isamen sarkari chitthiyon, vijyaptiyon aadi ko chhodkar sthaayee mahatva kii samagriyon ko chunakar prakashit kiya gaya
 This booklet called Jawaharlal Nehru Valmay was published in 15 volumes in English and has been published in 11 volumes by Sasta Sahitya Mandal in Hindi

 It is famous as the Motheshwar Mahadev Temple due to the high thickness of the Shivling
 skanda puraana ke anusaar bhagwaan shiv ne kaha ki jo bhakt kanvad kandhe par rakhkar haridwar se ganga jal laakar yahaan chadhayega, use moksh milegaa
 Due to this belief, people offer kavad here on completion of their vow

 Many people tried to measure its depth but could not measure it

 At first its ground floor was open but in 1942-43 three-four people died due to stampede in the ground floor of the temple, so the ground floor was closed since then for safety

 It is said that the floor of the first temple was of pure brass

 It is believed that Guru Dronacharya was teaching the kaurava-pandavas in Govisharan, when Dronacharya saw the Shivling

 At one time there were 120 Shiva temples surrounding this temple

 In order to explain electromagnetism and magnetic forces, Faraday conceived a type of universal ether and stated that this ether was conceived and that it was only due to ethereal deformation that these forces are produced

 Apart from this, now this theory is well explained by the Fareday effect of electrical and magnetic fields on light and the Zeeman effect and Kerr effect of electrical field

 It has been proved by many experiments that when a material moves, ether bound in it moves along with it, but with less velocity
 falat: is veg kii disha main chalanevaale prakaash kaa veg kuch bad jaataa he or vipareet disha main chalanevaale prakaash kaa veg kuch ghat jaataa he
 But when Michelson and Morley tried to measure the velocity of the Earth's motion based on this fact with a very sensitive method, it turned out to be the opposite of the hope that the speed of the Earth has no effect on the velocity of light

 It is one of the few sun temples of India
 san 1984 main unesco ne ise vishwa dharohar sthal ke rup main manyata di he
 This temple was dedicated to Surya-deva, meaning extracts, which the locals called biranchi-narayan
 isi kaaran is kshetra ko use arq-kshetra yaa padam-kshetra kaha jaataa tha
 According to the Puranas, Lord Krishna's son Samb had developed leprosy due to his curse
 samb ne mithravan main chandrabhaga nadi ke sagar sangam par konark main, baarah varshon tak tapasya kii or surya dev ko prasann kiya tha
 Suryadev, who was the destroyer of all diseases, had also prevented its disease
 tadnusaar samb ne surya bhagwaan kaa ek mandir nirmaan kaa nishchay kiya
 Taking a bath in the Chandrabhaga river, after his destruction, he found a statue of Suryadev
 yah murti suryadev ke sharir ke hi bhaag se, devshilpi shri vishwakarma ne banaayi thi
 Samb installed this idol in a temple in his built Mitravan, since then this place came to be considered sacred
 yah kai itihaaskaaron kaa mat he, ki konark mandir ke nirmaankarta, raja langool nrisinghdev kii akaal mrityu ke kaaran, mandir kaa nirmaan kaary khatai main pad gaya
 As a result, the unfinished structure collapsed
 lekin is mat ko aitihaasik aankadon kaa samarthan nahin miltaa he
 According to the figures of the Madal Register of Puri and some 1278 AD copper sheets, it was revealed that King Langul Narsinghdeva ruled till 1282
 kai itihaaskaar, is mat ke bhi hai, ki konark mandir kaa nirmaan 1253 se 1260 i
 ke bich hua tha
 Therefore, the incomplete construction of the temple is not logical to be the reason for its collapse
 yahan par mandir kii dhwastata ke sampoorn kaarnon kaa ullekh karnaa jatil kaary se kam nahin he
 But it is well known that much of it has now been destroyed
 jiske mukhya kaaran vaastu dosha bhi kaha jaataa he parantu muslim akramanon kii bhoomika ahm rahi he
 It is said that this temple was eroded in just 800 years due to its architectural defects
 jise vaastu kala va niyamon ke viruddh kaha-suna jaataa he
 For this reason, even before its time period, it collapsed despite being a unique example of Rigveda and Stone Art
 is surya-mandir ke mukhya vaastu dosha hai:-
 According to many legends, a magnetic stone is placed on the summit of the Sun Temple
 iske prabhaav se, konark ke samudr se guzarane vaale sagarpot, is ore khinche chale aate hai, jisase unhen baari kshati ho jaati he
 According to another legend, due to this stone, the magnetic direction representation devices of ships do not tell the right direction
 is kaaran apane poton ko bachaane hetu, muslim navik is pathar ko nikaal le gayi
 This stone was acting as a central stone, so that all the stones in the temple walls were in balance
 iske hatane ke kaaran, mandir kii deevaaron kaa santulan kho gaya or parinamtah ve gir padin
 But there is no historical description of this incident, nor is there any description of the existence of any such magnetic central stone
 konark mandir ke girane se sambandhi ek ati mahatvapurn siddhant, kalapahad se judaa he
 According to the history of Orissa, Kalapahad invaded here in 1508 and destroyed many Hindu temples of Orissa including Konark temple
 puri ke jagannatha mandir ke madan panji bataate hai, ki kaise kalapahaad ne urisa par hamalaa kiya
 He also demolished the statues of most Hindu temples, including the Konark temple
 haalanki konark mandir kii 20-25 feet moti deevaaron ko todna asambhav tha, usne kisi prakaar se dadhinauti ko hilaane kaa prayojan kar liya, jo ki is mandir ke girane kaa kaaran bana
 Due to the removal of Dadhinauti, the temple started to fall slowly and due to heavy stone falling from the roof, the roof of the silent hall also collapsed
 usne yahan kii adhikansh murtiyon or konark ke anya kai mandir bhi dhwast kar diye
 In 1568, the terror of Muslims in Orissa was under control
 parantu iske baad bhi hindu mandiron ko todane ke nirantar prayaas hote rahe
 At this time, the pandas of Jagannath temple of Puri removed the idol of Lord Jagannath from the shrine and hid it in a secret place
 isi prakaar, konark ke surya mandir ke pandon ne pradhan devtaa kii murti ko hataa kar, varshon tak ret main dabaa kar chipaaye rakhaa
 Later, this idol was sent to Puri and placed there in the temple of Indra, located in the courtyard of the Jagannath temple
 anya logon ke anusaar, yahaan kii puja murtiyon abhi bhi khoji jaani baaki hai
 But many people say that the idol of Surya Dev, which is kept in the National Museum of New Delhi, is the main worship idol of Konark
 phir bhi konark main, surya vandana mandir se murti ke hatane ke baad se band ho gayi
 Due to this, pilgrims stopped coming to Konark
 konark kaa pattan bhi daakuon ke hamale ke kaaran, band ho gaya
 Konark was a famous city for commercial activities similar to Surya Vandana, but due to the closure of these activities, it became completely uninhabited and was covered with a deep forest for years
 san 1626 main, khurda ke raja, nrisingh dev, suputr shri purushottam dev, suryadev kii murti ko do anya surya or chandra kii murtiyon sahit puri le gayi
 Now they meet in the courtyard of the temple of Puri
 puri ke madal panji ke itihaas se gyaat hota he, ki san 1028 main, raja nasinghdev ne konark ke sabhi mandiron ke naap-jokh kaa aadesh diya tha
 At the time of the measurement, the Sun Temple existed up to its Amalka sila, i
e
 about 200 feet high
 kalapahaad ne keval uskaa kalash, balki padam-dhwaja, camel-kirit or upree bhaag bhi dhwans kiye the
 As mentioned earlier, in front of the mouthpiece, there was a large stone block - Navagraha Pat
 khurda ke tatkaaleen raja ne vah khand hatwa diya, saath hi konark se kai shilp krit pashaan bhi le gaya
 And used them in the construction of the temple of Puri
 maratha kaal main, puri ke mandir kii chaharadivari ke nirmaan main konark ke pathar prayog kiye gayi the
 It is also reported that all parts of the Nat temple have been in their original state for the longest period of time
 or inhen maratha kaal main jaan boojh kar anupayogi bhaag samaj kar todaa gaya
 In 1779, a Maratha monk removed the Arun Pillar of Konark and got it installed in front of the Sinhwar Gate of Puri
 aththarahavin shatabdi ke ant tak, konark ne apana, sara vaibhav kho diya or ek jangal main badal gaya
 Along with this, the area of the temple also became a forest, where there were bases of wild animals and bandits
 yahaan sthaneey log bhi din ke prakaash tak main jane se darate the
 The word Konark is made up of a combination of the words 'angle' and 'extract'
 arq kaa arth hota he surya jabaki kone se abhipraay kone yaa kinare se rahaa hoga

 This temple is one of the most famous sites in India
 ise unesco dwaara san 1984 main vishwa dharohar sthal ghoshit kiya gaya he
 The temple built in Kalinga style, the Sun God is enshrined as a chariot and the stones are engraved with exquisite carvings
 sampoorn mandir sthal ko baarah jodi chakron ke saath saat ghodon se khinchate huye nirmit kiya gaya he, jisamen surya dev ko virajman dikhaaya gaya he
 But currently only one of the seven horses remains
 mandir ke aadhaar ko sundarata pradaan karte ye baarah chakra saal ke baarah maheenon ko paribhaashit karte hai tathaa prayek chakra aath aron se mil kar bana he, jo ar din ke aath peharon ko darshaate hai
 Locals here used to call the Sun God presented as birnchi-narayan
 mukhya mandir teen mandapon main bana he
 Of these, two tents have collapsed
 tisare mandap main jahaan murti thi, angrezon ne bhartiya swatantraaa se purv hi ret va pathar bharva kar sabhi dwaaron ko sthaayee rup se band karvaa diya tha taaki vah mandir or kshatigrast naa ho paae
 There are three idols of Sun God in this temple: iske pravesh par do singh haathiyon par aakraamak hote hue raksha main tatpar dikhaaye gaye hai
 It is probably a symbol of the dominance of the then Brahmin lions in the form of Buddhist elephants

 baarah sau vaastukaron or kaarigaron kii sena ne apni srujanaatmak pratibha or urja se paripurna kala se baarah varshon kii athak mehnat se iskaa nirmaan kiya
 The king had already spent money equal to the tax receipts of his kingdom for twelve years

 But soon after, the body of this remarkable genius was found on the sea shore
