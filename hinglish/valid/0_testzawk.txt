 Despite being a writer and poet of Persian and Urdu, he adopted the language of behavior of erstwhile noble people for his prose-writing work

 inaki vishesh khyaati hindi ke mahakavy padmavat main raja ratansen ke naam se rahi he
 Some historians believe his ascension in 1301 AD and some in 1302 AD
 inaki patni itihaas-prasiddh rani padmini yaa padmavati thi
 These were destroyed along with the family and the government in 1303 AD by the invasion of Alauddin Khilji
 praayah 1 varsh kaa hi shashan kaal hone tathaa inke saath hi inke vansh kaa ant ho jane se pashchaatkaaleen bhaaton-chaarnon kii gaathaon main inkaa naam hi lupt ho gaya tha
 Even being based mainly on these sources, they have not even been named in Colonel Tod's famous Rajasthani treatise
 unke sthaan par atyant bhraamak rup se bhimsingh se inaki patni rani padmini kaa sambandh joda gaya he
 Renowned historian Mahamahopadhyay Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha proved the historicity of Rawal Ratnasinh while clarifying Colonel Tod's mistake
 ojha ji ne sari bhrantiyaan tathaa sachai spasht karte hue likhaa he ki "rawal summersingh ke peeche uskaa putr ratnasingh chittod kii gaddi par baitha
 It was only a few months before he ruled, so Sultan of Delhi Alauddin Khilji attacked Chittor and after fighting for more than six months, he took the fort
 mewar ke kuch khyaton, rajprashasti, mahakavy or karnal tod ke rajasthan main to ratnasingh kaa naam tak nahin diya
 Karan Singh is written to be the king after Samarsingh, but Karansingh is not after Samarsingh, but it was 8 generations before that
 muhanot nanasi apni khyath main likhata he ki ratansi padmani ke maamle main allaudin se ladakar kaam aayaa; parantu vah ratnasingh ko ek jagah to samarsi kaa putr or duusari jagah ajaisi kaa putr or bhadlakhamasi kaa bhai batalaata he, jisamen se pichhlaa kathan vishwaas-yogya nahin he, kyonki lakhamasi ajaisi kaa putr nahin kintu pita or sisode kaa sardaar tha
 Thus Ratnasinh was not the brother of Lakhmsi but the lord of Mewar and the son of Samarsingh, as found in the inscription and Ekalingamahatmya of Kumbhalgarh dated 1517, around the time of Rana Kumbhakarna
 in donon main yah bhi likhaa he ki summersingh ke peeche uskaa putr ratnasingh raja hua
 When he was killed, Lakshman Singh was killed, along with his seven sons, by destroying the Mlechchas for the protection of Chittor
 " No details are available regarding Ratnasinh more than the ancient inscriptions etc
 allaudin khilji ke akraman se sambaddh vivaran amir khusro ke 'tarikhe alaai' main miltaa he
 The above book by Amir Khusro shows that Sultan Alauddin Khilji left Delhi to take Chittor on 28 January 1303 AD and the fort was conquered on 26 August 1303 AD
 allaudin khilji ke akraman ke sambandh main mahakavi malik mohammad jaaysi ne apane suprasiddh mahakavy padmavat main likhaa he ki yah akraman raja ratansen kii adwitiya sundari patni padmavati ko praapt karne ke liye hua tha or anek varshon tak gheraa daalane ke baad asafal hokar khilji laut gaya tha tathaa dubaara akraman karke vijayi hua tha
 But now with the historical facts coming out, historians have started to believe that the main reason for the invasion was the imperial ambition of Alauddin and the military and commercial utility of Chittor
 gujarat, malwa, madhya pradesh, sanyukt praant, sindh aadi bhaagon ke vyapaarik maarg chittod se hokar guzarate the
 It is natural that an ambitious Sultan like Alauddin Khilji would like to authorize it
 yah sambhav he ki padmini kii sundarataa jaanakar uskaa ek uddeshy use praapt karnaa bhi ho gaya ho
 Whatever be the reason, but Alauddin's invasion destroyed the life of Rawal Ratnasinh along with the rule and Rani Padmini, along with her majority friends and other queens, became Sati by doing Jauhar

 After Gandhi's emotional speech, he advocated his theory that all violence and evil cannot be justified
 kintu aisa is narsanhaar or uske baad hui hinsa se gandhi ji ne apana man sampurna sarkaar aar bhartiya sarkaar ke kabje vaali sansthaaon par sampurna niyantran laane par kendrit tha jo jaldi hi swaraj athwa sampurna vyaktigat, aadhyatmik evam rajnatik aazaadee main badalane vaala tha
 In December 1921 Gandhi was appointed as the executive officer of the Indian National Congress
 unke netritv main congress ko swaraj

 Gandhiji expanded his non-violent platform to include Swadeshi policy - which included boycott of foreign goods, especially English goods
 isse judane vaali unki vakaalat kaa kahana tha ki sabhi bhartiya angrejon dwaara banaae vastron kii apeksha hamaare apane logon dwaara haath se banaai gai khaadi pahanen
 Gandhi ji asked men and women to spend time in spinning yarn for Khadi every day to support the freedom movement

 Apart from this, Gandhiji also requested to boycott UK educational institutions and courts and quit government jobs and to return the honors and honors received from the government

 Then as soon as this movement reached its top, in February 1922, it ended in terrible hatred in chauri-chora, Uttar Pradesh
 andolan dwaara hinsa kaa ruukh apnaane ke dar ko dhyaan main rakhte hue or is par vichaar karte hue ki isse uske sabhi kaaryon par pani phir jayega, gandhi ji ne vyapak asahyog ke is andolan ko waapas le liya
 Gandhi was arrested on 10 March 1922, Gandhi was prosecuted for treason in which he was sentenced to six years imprisonment and imprisoned
 18 march, 1922 se lekar unhone keval 2 saal hi gel main bitaye the ki unhen farvari 1924 main aanton ke oparation ke liye reeha kar diya gaya
 Without Gandhiji's unified personality, the Indian National Congress began to split into two parties during his two years in prison, one party led by Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru, who favored the party's participation in the House
 The leadership was led by Chakravarti Rajagopalacharya and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 iske alaava, hinduon or musalamaanon ke bich ahimsa andolan kii charam seemaa par pahunchakar sahyog tut rahaa tha
 Gandhiji tried to fill this gap with a number of means including fasting for three weeks with limited success in the spring of 1924

 a year earlier, the British Government, under the leadership of Sir John Simon, created a new Constitutional Reform Commission in which not a single member was Indian
 iskaa parinaam bhartiya rajnatik dalon dwaara bahishkaar niklaa
 In December 1928, Gandhiji made a motion in a session of the Congress held in Calcutta asking him to give power to the Indian Empire or face the non-cooperation Movement for the independence of the entire country as his motive for not doing so
 Be prepared to do

 The British did not respond

 The Indian National Congress celebrated 26 January 1930 as the Indian Independence Day in Lahore
 yah din lagbhag prayek bhartiya sanghathanon dwaara bhi manaaya gaya
 After this, Gandhiji launched a new Satyagraha in protest against the taxation of salt in March 1930, which was a 400 km journey from Ahmedabad to Dandi, Gujarat to commemorate the salt movement from 12 March to 6 April to produce salt on its own

 It was signed in March 1931 by the Treaty of Irwin Gandhi
 savinay avagya andolan ko band karne ke liye british sarkaar ne sabhi rajnatik kaidiyon ko reeha karne ke liye apni rajamandi de di
 As a result of this agreement, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference to be held in London as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress

 In addition, Lord Willington, the successor of Lord Irwin, began a new campaign to control and crush the movement of nationalists
 gandhi phir se giraftaar kar liye gaye or sarkaar ne unke anuyaiyon ko unase purnataya dur rakhte hue gandhi ji dwaara prabhavit hone se rokane kii koshish kii
 However, this tactic was not successful

 In protest against this, Gandhiji took a six-day hunger strike in September 1932, which forced the government to successfully adopt a similar system of mediation by Palvankar Balu, a Dalit-turned-political leader
 achhuton ke jivan ko sudhaarney ke liye gandhi ji dwaara chalaae gaye is abhiyaan kii shuruuaat thi
 Gandhiji named these untouchables as Harijans whom they considered to be children of God
 8 may 1933 ko gandhi ji ne harijan andolan main madad karne ke liye aatm shuddhikaran kaa 21 din tak chalane vaala upwas kiya
 This new campaign was not liked by the Dalits however he remained a prominent leader
 dow ambedkar ne gandhi ji dwaara harijan shabd kaa upyog karne kii spasht ninda kii, ki dalit saamaajik rup se aparipakv hai or suvidhasampann jati vaale bharatiyon ne pitrusattatmak bhoomika nibhaai he
 Ambedkar and his allies also felt that Gandhiji was undermining the political rights of Dalits
 haalanki gandhi ji ek vaisya jati main paidaa hue phir bhi unhonen is baat par jor diya ki vah dow ambedkar jaise dalit masiha ke hote hue bhi vah daliton ke liye aawaaj uthaa saktaa he
 Untouchability was a major evil in the social evils of India during the Indian freedom struggle, against which Mahatma Gandhi and his followers struggled
 us samay desh ke pramukh mandiron main harijanon kaa pravesh purnatah pratibandhit tha
 Thrissur, the district of Kerala state, is a major religious city in South India
 yaheen ek pratishthit mandir he guuruvayur mandir, jisamen krishna bhagwaan ke balaroop ke darshan karaati bhagwaan guruvayurppan kii murti sthapit he
 Like other temples before independence, there was complete ban on entry of Harijans in this temple too
 kerala ke gandhi samarthak shri kelppan ne mahatma kii ajna se is pratha ke viruddh aawaaj uthaayi or antat iske liye san 1933 i0 main savinay avagya prarambh kii gayi
 The trustees of the temple were told that the first day of the new year, that is, January 1, 1934, would be celebrated as the last decision day and that in the event of no determination from their level on this date, the activists by Mahatma Gandhi and Mr
 Kelappan Fasting can be done in favor of is kaaran guruvayur mandir ke trusteo kii ore se baithak bulaakar mandir ke upasko kii raay bhi praapt kii gayi
 In the meeting, on the basis of majority given by 77 percent of the devotees, the entry of Harijans into the temple was approved and thus the entry of Harijans as a success of the determination day in Sri Guruvayur temple in Kerala from 1 January 1934, in principle Got approval
 guruvayur mandir jisamen aaj bhi gaiyr hinduon kaa pravesh varjit he tathaapi kai dharmon ko maanane vaale bhagwaan bhagwaan guruvayurappan ke param bhakt hai
 With the inspiration of Mahatma Gandhi, the first day of January was celebrated as the determination day and the decision made was received
 
 In the summer of 1934, three unsuccessful attempts were made to kill him

 He did not disagree with the party's move but felt that if he resigned, his popularity with the Indians would facilitate the strengthening of the party's membership which has hitherto belonged to communists, socialists, trade associations, students, religious leaders
 Laker existed between trade unions and various voices

 Gandhi, while leading a party for Raj, did not want to prove any goal by campaigning which would be accepted as a political arrangement with Raj temporarily
 gandhi ji nehru presidensi or congress ke lahore adhiveshan ke saath hi 1936 main bharat laut aae
 However, Gandhi wished to focus his full attention on achieving independence and not on speculation about India's future
 usne congress ko samaajwaad ko apane uddeshy ke rup main apnaane se nahin roka
 Gandhi had differences with Subhash Bose, who was elected to the presidency in 1938
 bose ke saath matbhedon main gandhi ke mukhya bindu bose kii loktantr main patibaddhta kii kami tathaa ahimsa main vishwaas kii kami thi
 Bose won for the second time in spite of Gandhi's criticism, but left the Congress when all Indian leaders abandoned all the principles implemented by Gandhiji

 As the war progressed Gandhiji intensified his demand for independence by giving the British the Quit India Movement
 yah gandhi tathaa congress party kaa sarvaadhik spasht vidroh tha jo bhartiya seemaa se angrejon ko khadedane par lakshith tha
 Jawaharlal Nehru's party, sitting second to Gandhiji, was criticized by some members of the party and by some other political Indian parties who believed in both the British and the opposition
 kuch kaa maananaa tha ki apane jivan kaal main athwa maut ke sangharsh main angrejon kaa virodh karnaa ek nashwar kaary he jabaki kuch maanate the ki gandhi ji paryaapt koshish nahin kar rahe hai
 Quit India became the most powerful movement of this struggle which led to widespread violence and arrest
 police kii goliyon se hajaaron kii sankhya main swatantraaa senaanee yaa to maare gaye yaa ghayal ho gaye or hajaaron giraftaar kar liye gaye
 Gandhi and his supporters made it clear that he would not support the war effort unless India was granted immediate independence
 unhone spasht kiya ki is baar bhi yah aandolan band nahin hoga yadi hinsa ke vyaktigat krityon ko moort rup diya jaataa he
 He said that the order of chaos around him is worse than real anarchy
 unhone sabhi congressiyon or bharatiyon ko ahimsa ke saath karo yaa maro ke dwaara antim swatantrata ke liye anushaasan banaae rakhane ko kaha
 Gandhiji and all members of the Congress Working Committee were arrested by the British on 9 August 1942 in Mumbai
 gandhi ji ko pune ke anga khan mahal main do saal tak bandi banaakar rakhaa gaya
 This was the time when Gandhiji suffered two deep blows in his personal life
 unka 50 saal purana sachiv mahadev desai 6 din baad hi dil kaa daura padane se mar gaye or gandhi ji ke 18 maheene jail main rahane ke baad 22 farvari 1944 ko unki patni kasturba gandhi kaa dehanth ho gaya
 Six weeks later, Gandhiji also suffered from severe malaria
 unke kharaab swasthya or jaruri upachaar ke kaaran 6 may 1944 ko yuddh kii samaapti se purv hi unhen reeha kar diya gaya
 Raj did not want to see him dying in jail which would increase the anger of the country
 haalanki bharat chodo andolan ko apane uddeshy main ashink safalataa hi mili lekin andolan ke nishthur daman ne 1943 ke ant tak bharat ko sangathit kar diya
 At the end of the war, the British gave a clear indication that the Santha would be transferred and handed over to the Indians
 is samay gandhi ji ne andolan ko band kar diya jisase congressi netaaon sahit lagbhag 100,000 rajnatik bandiyon ko reeha kar diya gaya
 In 1946, Gandhiji advised the Congress to reject the proposal of the British kbnet Mission as he was deeply skeptical of the proposed grouping for Muslim dominated provinces, hence Gandhi viewed the episode as a rehearsal of a partition
 haalanki kuch samay se gandhi ji ke saath congress dwaara matbhedon vaali ghatana main se yah bhi ek ghatana bani chunki nehru or patel jaanate the ki yadi congress is yojana kaa anumodan nahin karti he tab sarkaar kaa niyantran muslim lig ke paas chalaa jayega
 Between 1948, over 5000 people were killed during the violence
 gandhi ji kisi bhi aisi yojana ke khilaaf the jo bharat ko do alag alag deshon main vibhajit kar de
 The overwhelming majority of many Hindus and Sikhs and Muslims living in India were in favor of the partition of the country
 iske atirikt mohammad ali jinna, muslim lig ke netaa ne, pashchim punjab, sindh, uttar pashchim seemaant praant or purvi bengal main vyapak sahyog kaa parichay diya
 In order to stop the widespread hindu-muslim fighting, Congress leaders gave their approval to this plan of partition

 Close associates of Gandhiji accepted Partition as the best solution and Sardar Patel tried to convince Gandhiji that this was the only way to prevent a war with civil unrest
 majboor gandhi ne apni anumati de di
 He held intense discussions with leaders of Muslim and Hindu communities in North India as well as Bengal to calm the warm attitude

 Leaders like Sardar Patel feared that Pakistan could use this money to wage war against India

 He started his first fast-unto-death in Delhi asking for immediate end to communal violence for all and to pay Rs 55 crore to Pakistan
 gandhi ji ko dar tha ki pakistan main asthirataa or asuraksha se bharat ke prati unka gussa or bad jayega tathaa seemaa par hinsa fail jaaegi
 He further feared that Hindus and Muslims would renew their enmity again and that there could be a possibility of a civil war
 jivan bhar gandhi ja kaa saath dene vaale sahyogiyon ke saath bhavuk bahes ke baad gandhi ji ne baat kaa maanane se inkaar kar diya or sarkaar ko apni niti par adig rahanaa padaa tathaa pakistan ko bhugtan kar diya
 The leaders of Hindu Muslim and Sikh community assured them that they would forget peace and bring peace

 In line with these ideas, in 1940, when the invasions by Nazi Germany on the British islands appeared imminent, Gandhiji asked the British to follow the following policy of non-violence in peace and war

 gandhi ji ne landan main rahete samay or uske baad shaakaahaari bhojan kii vakaalat karne main kaaphi samay bitaayaa
 Gandhiji said that vegetarian food not only fulfills the needs of the body but it also serves the economic purpose which is made of meat and yet meat is more expensive than grains, vegetables and fruits
 iske alaava kai bhartiya jo aay kam hone kii vajah se sangharsh kar rahe the, us samay jo shaakaahaari ke rup main dikhaai de rahe the vah aadhyatmik parampara hi nahin vyaavhaarikta ke kaaran bhi tha

 Gandhiji used to make fruit from the beginning, but started drinking goat's milk on the advice of his doctor
 He never used to consume milk-products because earlier he believed that milk is not a natural diet of man and he was fed with cow's milk
 Chitkaar Seghrina was, and the most important reason was the oath which he made to his late mother

 This decision was completely influenced by the philosophy of Brahmacharya
 Spiritual and practical purity is largely associated with celibacy and disinterestedness
 Gandhi saw celibacy as the primary basis for getting closer to God and identifying himself in his autobiography
 The childhood bride tells her libido and Ishrya's struggles with Kasturba
 She realized that this person They have a duty to remain celibate so that they can learn the love of lust instead
 For Gandhi, celibacy meant "control of thoughts, words and actions within the senses"

 Gandhi used to wear silence one day a week
 He believed that by refraining from speaking, he gets inner peace
 This influence of Hindu silence theory on him, and he used to contact others by writing on paper on those days, for three and a half years from the age of 37, Gandhiji refused to read newspapers, in response to which he said The steady state of the world today has confused him more than his own inner turmoil

 After returning from South Africa, where he had completed advocacy and was associated with wealth and success, he renounced western-style clothes
 He accepted the clothes worn by India's poorest man, and Gandhi also advocated wearing home-made clothes
 Gandhi and his followers adopted the practice of weaving their own clothes through cotton and others like it
