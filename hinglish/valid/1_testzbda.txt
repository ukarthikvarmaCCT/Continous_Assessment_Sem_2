 John Cutler, an American public health officer, started research with the help of several agencies in the United States and Guatemala
 research ke dauraan kareeb 1,300 logonmen vibhinn bimaariyaan sankramit kii gayi
 Syphilis was one of the diseases spread by forming a sexual relationship
 jaanch main pataa chalaa ki researchron ne kaidiyon or maansik rogiyon ko yonkarmiyon se sambandh banane ke liye majaboor kiya
 Due to this many people got syphilis
 peeditonke jananaangon or sharir ke kai hisson main funfood lag gaya
 Syphilis reached the inner parts of the body from the genitals
 kai rogiyon ko lakva maar gaya, kuch andhe ho gaye auraaise rogiyon kii jaan bhi chali gai
 Many experiments were conducted on these patients in the name of treatment
 sifalis failaane ke baad rogiyon ko antibiotic pencylin ke inkjeshan lagaae gaye
 The Commission has come across a case when a mentally ill woman was infected with syphilis
 phir doctor katler ne uskaa adhyayan kiya gaya
 She was standing at the mouth of death but Cutler had to keep experimenting
 sifalis ke baad mahila astidi se sankramit kiya gaya
 Eventually the woman died
 is baat ke likhit saboot hai ki doctorkatler is dauraan mahila par nazar rakhe hue the

 velesle college kii professor sujan reverbai kahati hai,"unhone sochaa ki ham bimariyon ke khilaaf yuddh kar rahe hai or yuddh main jawan maare jate hai
 It is very easy to say that in future we will not do this
 But we really need to think about it
 ham abhi jo kar rahe hai or 20 saal baad daraavna lagane lagegaa
" Reverbai, who played a key role in the revelation of the case, says that until 1972, the use of syphilis on black women continued in the US state of Alabama
 doctor katalraki 2003 main maut ho gai
 Cutler never apologized for his act
 In recent years, many concrete things have emerged about this matter
 yahi vajah he ki pichlesaal america sarkaar ko guatemala ke logon se maafee maangani padi

 neend apekshaakrit nilambit samvedi or sanchaalak gatividhi kii chetana kii ek prakritik baar-baar aanevaali roopantarit sthiti he, jo lagbhag sabhi svaichhik mansapeshiyon kii niskriyata kii visheshta liye hue hota he
 It is best kept awake state, when the ability to react to a stimulus or arousal is reduced and kept away from the unconscious, as it is easier to get out of sleep than a cold sleep or coma
 neend ek unnat nirmaan kriya vishyak sthiti he, jo vikaas par jor detii he or jo rogksham tantra, tantrika tantra, kankaleey or mansapeshi pranali main nayi jaan daal detii he
 It is followed in all mammals, in all birds and in many reptiles, amphibians and fish
 neend ke uddeshy or prakriya sirf aanshik rup se hi spasht hai or ye gahan shodh ke vishay hai
 In mammals and birds, sleep is divided into two main parts: fast eye movements and non-fast eye movements
 Each type is associated with a different set of physical, neurological and psychological characteristics
 american academy of sleep medicine ne NREM ko or bhi teen staron main vibhajit kiya he: N1, N2 or N3
 antim str ko delta sleep yaa slo-wave sleep bhi kehete hai
 Sleep proceeds in the cycle of REM and NREM, the sequence being normally N1 → N2 → N3 → N2 → REM
 raat main aarambh main bahut adhik gahari neend hua karti he, jabaki raat main baad main or prakritik jaagran se thik pehle REM neend kaa anupaat bad jaataa he
 The stages of sleep were first described by Alfred Lee Loomis and his colleagues in 1937; Who divided the various electroencephalography characteristics of sleep into five levels, which represent the order from waking to deep sleep
 1953 main, REM nidra ke bhinn rup kii khoj kii gayi or is prakaar wiliam dement or nathanial clitman ne nidra ko NREM charnon tathaa REM main punarvargeekrut kiya
 In 1968, in "R&K Sleep Scoring Manual" Alan Rechtschaffen and Anthony Kales standardized the criteria for stages
 aar and ke maanak main, NREM nidra ko chaar charnon main vibhajit kiya gaya tha, dhimi-tarangon kii nidra charnon ko charan 3 or 4 rakhaa gaya
 In Phase 3, delta waves are less than 50% of the total wave pattern, while in Phase 4 they exceed 50%
 iske alaava, REM nidra kaa ullekh kabhi-kabhi charan 5 ke rup main kiya jaataa tha
 In 2004, AASM appointed the AASM Visual Scoring Task Force to review the R&K scoring system
 samiksha se kai badlaav kiye gayi, inamen sabase mahatvapurn rahaa charan 3 or charan 4 kaa charan N3 main sangyojan
 2007 main sanshodhit scoring da AASM minial for scoring of sleep and associated events ke rup main prakashit hua
 Stimulus and breathing, cardiovascular and motion episodes were also added
 visheshikrut nidra prayogshaala main polisomnography dwaara neend ke charan tathaa neend kii anya visheshtaon kaa aam taur par moolyankan kiya jaataa he
 Measurements taken include EEG of brain waves, electroculography of eye movements and electromyography of skeletal muscle activity
 manushyon main, prayek nidra chakra ausat 90 se 110 minute tak ke liye rahata he, or prayek charan ke alag-alag shaareerik kaary ho sakate hai
 This may cause sleepiness and may cause unconsciousness, but it does not complete physical work
 2007 ke eeesem maanakon ke anusaar, enariem teen charnon ke hote hai
 NREM has relatively few dreams
 charan N1 mastishk ke sankraman se sambandhit he, is charan main mastishk 8 se 13 hertz kii frequency ke alpha tarangon se 4 se 7 hertz frequency kii theta tarangon main sankraman karata he
 This phase is sometimes referred to as drowsiness or sound sleep
 achaanak jhatka aana or neend ke ubharne ko sakaaratmak myochlonus ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, jo N1 ke dauraan neend ke aarambh ke saath judaa ho saktaa he
 Some people may also have hypnotic hallucinations during this phase, which can be troublesome for them
 N1 ke dauraan, vyakti kuch mansapeshi dasha or bahari vaataavaran kii sabase adhik sachet jaagrukta ganvaa detaa he
 The characteristic of phase N2 is that during this time the sleep spindle rotates between 11 and 16 Hz and K-complexes
 is charan ke dauraan, jaisaa ki EMG dwaara mapa gaya, mansapeshiyon kii gatividhi kam ho jaati he or bahari vaataavaran ke prati sachet jaagrukta gaayab ho jaati he
 In adults, this stage occurs in 45% to 55% of total sleep
 stage N3 kaa charitra chithran is tarah kiya jaataa he ki is dauraan delta tarangon kaa kam se kam 20% 0
5 se 2 hertz ke bich hon or chotii-se-chotii aayam >75 μv kaa ho
 Parasomnians like night terror, night bed, walking in sleep and sleep disturbances occur in this phase
 kai drushtaant or vivaran abhi bhi 20% -50% delta tarangon ke saath N3 charan or 50% se adhik delta tarangon ke saath N4 ko darshaate hai; ye sanyukt rup se charan N3 hai
 Fast eye movement sleep, or REM sleep, accounts for 20% –25% of the total sleep of most human adults
 aariem nidra ke liye mandandon main tej netra gati or ek drut kam-voltage iiji shaamil he
 The most memorable dreams come at this stage
 kam se kam stanadhariyon main, ek avarohi mansapeshi tanaav dekha gaya he
 This type of paralysis may be necessary to protect the anatomy from self-harm, which may occur through physical activity from the living dreams often encountered during this phase
 neend kaa samay sirkadian ghadi, sleep-vek homeostasis dwaara niyantrit he or manushyon main, kuch seemaa ke andar, ichhashakti vyavhaar par nirbhar he
 The circadian clock — an internal timekeeping, temperature-instability, enzyme-controlling device — works in tandem with adenosine, a neurotransmitter that disrupts many physiological processes associated with wakefulness
 adenosine din bhar main taiyaar hota he; adenosine ke ucch str se tandra aati he
 In diurnal animals, sleepiness or drowsiness comes from the circadian element due to the release of the hormone melatonin and the gradual decrease in the body's internal temperature
 kisiike kronotip dwaara samay prabhavit hota he
 Circadian rotation determines the ideal timing of a properly structured and healthy sleeping episode
 homeostatic nidra kii sahajpravriti kaa santoshprad neend ke liye sirkadian tatv ke saath santulit hona jaruri he
 Along with the message received from the circadian clock, it tells the body that it needs sleep
 sirkadian aavartan se neend se jagane kaa mukhya rup se nirdhaaran hota he
 a person who regularly wakes up early, usually cannot sleep longer than his normal time, even if he has slept less
 neend kii avadhi DEC2 jin dwaara prabhavit he
 Some people have mutations of this gene; They sleep two hours less than normal
 tantrika sambandhi vigyaan kii professor ying-hui phu or unke sahyogiyon ne DEC2 utparivartan liye chuhon kii nasl paidaa kii, jo aam chuhon kii tulana main kam soya karte
 The optimal amount of sleep cannot be a meaningful concept, unless sleep or timing are seen in association with a person's circadian rotation
 a person's major sleep episode can be relatively fruitless and insufficient if it occurs at the "wrong" time of day; One should sleep for at least six hours before the body temperature is low
 sahi timming wo he jab neend ke madhya prakaran ke baad or jagane se pehle nimnlikhit do chihnak yaa marker prakat ho jaaen: Human sleep can vary by age and between individuals, and sleep is considered adequate if there is no drowsiness or dysfunction during the day
 vishvavidhyalay california, saan diego ke das lakh vayaskon ke ek manacchikitsa adhyayan main paaya gaya ki jo log sabase adhik samay tak jivit hai ve raat main chah se saat ghante roj swayan prerit hokar soya karte hai
 Another study on the risk of sleep duration and mortality in women found a similar result
 anya adhyayanon se pataa chalata he ki "pratidin 7 se 8 ghante se adhik neend lene waalon main badhi hui mrityu dar lagaataar judy hui he", haalanki is adhyayan kaa yah bhi kahana he ki iskaa kaaran avsaad or samajok-aarthik sthiti ho sakati he, jo aankadon kii drushti se sah-sambandhit ho jate hai
 It has also been said that compared to those who wake up on an alarm, those who naturally wake up after less sleep only show a correlation between fewer sleep hours and less morbidity
 varavik vishvavidhyalay or vishvavidhyalay college landan ke shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki neend kii kami hryday rog se mrityu ke khatre ko dugune se adhik badha detii he, lekin bahut adhik neend bhi mrityu ke khatre ko duguna karne ke saath judi ho sakati he, haalanki mukhya rup se hryday rog se nahin
 Professor Francisco Capuccio stated, "short sleep has been seen to be a risk factor for weight gain, hypertension and type 2 diabetes, and sometimes death; but long sleep leads to increased death as opposed to short sleep-mortality
 There is no possible mechanism to link the rate, it is yet to be investigated

 rokthaam ke sandarbh main, hamaare nishkarshon se pataa chalata he ki lagaataar prati raat saat ghante ke aasapaas sona swasthya ke liye ishtatam yaa sarvottam he or neend main nirantar kami biimaar swasthya ke liye pehle se pravrutt hona ho saktaa he
 " iske alaava, neend kii kathinaaiyaan ghanishtha rup se avsaad, madyapata or dwidhruvi vikaar jaise manorog vikaron se judy hai
 Sleep difficulties have been found in up to 90% of adults with depression

 Children need more sleep per day in order to develop and function properly: up to 18 hours for a newborn, then decrease as they age
 ek navjaat shishu rojaanaa lagbhag 9 ghante kii REM neend liya karata he
 By the age of five or above, REM sleeps for just over two hours
 paryaapt aaraam or neend nahin lene kaa asar he neend kaa karj; aise bade karj maansik, bhaavnaatmak or shaareerik thakaan kaa kaaran banate hai
 Sleep debt results in loss of ability to perform high level cognitive functions
 neurophysiological or kaaryaatmak imaging adhyayanon ne dikhaaya he ki mastishk ke saamne ke kshetra vishesh rup se homeostatic neend dabaav ke liye pratikriyasheel hai
 Scientists do not agree on how much sleep debt is possible; Does it accumulate according to a person's average sleep or is there some other criterion; Nor has there been any significant change in the prevalence of sleep debt among adults in the industrialized world in recent decades
 yah zarur hua he ki pehle kii tulana main pashchimi samaajon ke bachche kam so rahe hai
 It is suspected that when and for how long a person needs sleep, such as a greater magnitude of sleep-related behavior, is regulated by our genetics
 shodhakartaaon ne kuch saboot kii khoj kii he jisase is dharna ko samarthan miltaa hua lagata he
 Many theories about the function of sleep have proposed their own explanations, but it appears that understanding about the subject is currently incomplete
 aisa sambhav he ki kuch moulik kaary ko puraa karne ke liye neend kaa vikaas hua or samay ke saath isane kai kaam apana liya
 The issue was raised that if sleep was not necessary, one would be expected to know: aaj tak koi bhi pashu aisa nahin mila he jo in mandandon ko puraa kar sake
 Among the many proposed functions of sleep are the following
 neend dwaara ghaav bharne main sahaayta milte dekha gaya he
 In 2004 Gumustekin et al
 a study conducted by the study showed that lack of sleep hindered the healing of mice's burns
 yah paaya gaya he ki neend kii kshati rogksham pranali ko prabhavit karti he
 In 2007, Jäger et al
 In a study conducted by, mice were deprived of sleep for 24 hours
 jab ek niyantrit samooh ke saath tulana kii gayi to neend se vanchit chuhon ke rakt pareekshan main shwet rakt kan gananaa main 20% kii kami paayi gayi, jo ki rogksham pranali main ek mahatvapurn parivartan he
 It is now possible to be said that "sleep damage attenuates immune function and presents a challenge to immunological sleep manipulation," and it has been reported that mammalian animals that spend their long sleeps in the immune system Invest, because species that have long sleeps have more white blood cells
 yah pramanit hona abhi baaki he ki neend kii avadhi daihik vikaas ko prabhavit karti he
 In 2007 Jenny et al
 In a study by 305 children growth, height and weight were recorded, this was done in correlation with their parents, parents were informed of the bedtime of the children and the study lasted for nine years
 
 It was found that "changes in sleep duration in children do not seem to have an effect on their development
" " yah dekha gaya ki neend-or adhik vishesh rup se dhimi gati kii neend - vayask purushon ke hormone staron kii vruddhi ko prabhavit karti he
 During an eight-hour sleep, Van Couture, Leproult and Plaut found that those with a high percentage of SWS also had a high growth of hormone secretion, while those with a low percentage of SWS had a lower hormone increase
 neend ke swasthyakaari kaary ke paksh main anek tark he
 The metabolic phase during sleep is surgeon action; Surgeons such as growth hormones are secreted preferentially such as action hormones during sleep
 saamanytah, prajatiyon main neend kii avadhi, jaanavar ke aakaar se vipareet dhang se sambandhit he or sidhe-sidhe aadhariya chayapachay dar se judi hui he
 Rats with a very high basal metabolic rate sleep up to 14 hours daily, while elephants and giraffes sleep only 3-4 hours with low basal metabolic rates
 vaataavaran se andrik rachana ko band kiye bina shanti se aaraam karne ke jariye urja sangrakshan sampann kiya ja saktaa he, jo sambhawatah ek khatarnaak sthiti he
 a dull-sleeping animal is more likely to survive predators, while still conserving energy
 so, neend, urja sangrakshan karne ke alaava anya uddeshy yaa uddeshyon ko puraa karti lagati he; udhaaharan ke liye, suptavastha vaale pashu sheetanidra se jagane ke baad suptavastha kii avadhi ke dauraan neend puri nahin hone ke kaaran phir se neend main chale jate hai
 They are definitely well rested and have conserved energy during hibernation, but for some other reason they need to sleep
 jin chuhon ko anischitkaal tak jagaaye rakhaa jaataa he, unamem twachaa ke jakhm, hikeraphegia, sharir pind kaa nuksaan, alpataap or antat, ghaatak septicemia kaa vikaas hota he
 According to the ontogenetic hypothesis of REM sleep, newborn-related activity during REM sleep is particularly important for body development
 sakriy neend ke abhaav ke prabhaavon par kiye gayi adhyayanon se pataa chalaa ki jivan ke armbh main is abhaav se vyavhaar kii samasyaayein, sthaayee neend vighn, mastishk pind main kami or ek asaamaanya pariman main neuron koshikaon kii mrityu kii samasyaayein paidaa hoti hai
 REM sleep appears to be important for brain development
 shishuon kii neend ke adhikansh bhaag par REM neend kaa hi kabja hota he, shishu apana adhik samay neend main hi guzaara karte hai
 In various species, the more immature the baby is born, the more time it spends in REM sleep
 prastaavkon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki mastishk sakriyan kii upasthiti main rem-prerit mansapeshi avarodhan se chetopagam ko sakriy karne ke jariye mastishk vikaas main madad milti he, tathaapi kisi sanchaalak parinaam ke bagaiyr isse shishu mushkil main pad saktaa he
 Additionally, REM sleep deprivation leads to developmental abnormalities later in life
 baharhaal, isaki vyakhya nahin kii gayi he ki praudh vayaskon ko tab bhi kyon REM neend kii jarurat padati he
 Aquatic mammal infants do not sleep REM in infancy; REM sleep in such animals increases with aging
 vaigyanikon ne aise anek tareeke bataaye hai jinamein neend ko smriti se sambandhit dikhaaya gaya he
 a study by Turner, Drummond, Salamat, and Brown showed that sleep deprivation affected working memory
 karyrat smriti mahatvapurn he kyonki yah nirnay lene, tark-vitark karne or praasangik smriti jaise ucch stareey sangyanatmak kaaryon ke adhik prakraman or madad ke liye soochnaaon ko sakriy rakhata he
 The study allowed 18 women and 22 men to sleep only 26 minutes per night over a period of four days
 in vyaktiyon ne puure aaraam ke baad shuruyaat main sangyanatmak pareekshan die or phir chaar dinon main neend ke abhaav ke dauraan din main do baar pareekshan kiye gayi
 In the final test, the average working memory expansion of this sleep-deprived group was found to be 38% lower than the controlled group
 REM or dhimi gati kii neend jaise neend ke kuch charnon dwaara smriti alag tarah se prabhavit hoti jaan padati he
 In a study cited in Born, Rasch and Gess, several human subjects were used: awakening controlled groups and sleep testing groups
 The sleep and wake groups were taught a task and then tested in both the nighttime and late night time, in order to balance the order in all participants
 jab neend ke dauraan un pratibhaagiyon ke mastishk ko scan kiya gaya to hypnogram ne paaya ki raat ke aarambh main neend kaa charan SWS haaavee rahata he, jo neend charan gatividhi kaa ausatan 23% ke aasapaas kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Compared to the controlled group, the early-night test group performed 16% better on the declarative memory test
 der-raatri neend ke dauraan, lagbhag 24% ke saath REM sabase sakriy neend kaa charan ban gaya or niyantrit samooh kii tulana main prakriyaatmak smriti pareekshan main der-raatri pareekshan samooh ne 25% behatar pradarshan kiya
 This suggests that late-night rem-rich sleep benefits procedural memory, while early-night sws-rich sleep benefits declarative memory
 datta dwaara kiye gaye ek adhyayan main in parinaamon kaa paroksh rup se samarthan kiya gaya he
 22 male mice were made eligible for the study
 ek aise dibbe kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha jisamen ek chuha maje se ek chor se duusare chor tak aa-ja sake
 The bottom of the box was made of steel mesh
 ek dhwani ke saath dibbe main ek roshni chamakati
 paanch second baad, bijli kaa jhatka lagaaya jaataa
 jhatka shuru hote hi chuha dibbe ke duusare chor par chalaa jaataa, tab jhatka turant hi samaapt ho jaataa
 chuuhe bhi paanch second deree kaa upyog karke dibbe ke duusare chor ja sakate the or is tarah jatke se puri tarah batch sakate the
 The duration of the shock never exceeded five seconds
 aadhe chuhon par ise 30 baar duharaaya gaya
 The other half, the control group, were placed on the same trial, but the mice were jerked regardless of their response
 prayek prashikshan satr ke baad, chuuhe ko poligraphic recording ke liye chah ghante tak ek recording pinjre main rakhaa jaataa
 yah prakriya lagaataar teen dinon tak duhraayi gayi
 This study found that during post-sleep recording sessions of sleep testing, mice spent 25
47% more time in REM sleep after exercise trials, compared to after control trials
 These tests were conducted by Born et al
 The study results support a clear indication of the correlation between REM sleep and procedural knowledge
 datta adhyayan kaa ek avlokan yah he ki pareekshan ke baad recording satr ke dauraan niyantran samooh kii tulana main neend abhyaas samooh ne SWS main 180% adhik samay bitaayaa
 is tathy ko kudrimoti, burns or mecnuton dwaara kiye gayi ek adhyayan se samarthan mila
 This study suggests that after spatial search activity, the pattern of hippocampal cells in the experiment is reactivated during SWS
 kudrimoti at al
 ke ek adhyayan main, kisi chor main inaam kaa upyog karke saat chuhon ko ek rekhiy trek main daudaya gaya
 Rats were allowed 30 minutes to adapt to the track, then ran for 30 minutes in the track for reward-based training, and then allowed to rest for 30 minutes
 in teen prayek avadhiyon ke dauraan, chuhon kii neend ke charnon kii soochna ke lieiji data ekatra kiye gayi
 Kudrimoti et al
 Calculated the mean firing rates of the cells of the hippocampal during the pre-behavior of the SWS and the average of 22 track-times of seven mice, with a ten-minute break placed three times in response to the SWS
 nattejey bataate hai ki pareekshan daud satr ke baad ke das minute main purv str kii tulana main hippocample kii koshikaon kii min firing rate main 12% kii vruddhi dekhi gayi; haalanki 20 minute ke baad, min firing rate teji se purv str par waapas laut gayi
 The increase in firing of hippocampal cells during SWS after spatial exploration may explain why SWS sleep levels were increased in Datta's study, as it was also associated with a form of spatial exploration
 SWS ke dauraan dhime dolan ke pariman ko badhaane ke liye puromukhy valkal main ekadish dhara uttejan ko shaamil karte hue ek adhyayan hua 
 Directional current stimulation greatly increased word-pair recall the next day, providing evidence that SWS plays a large role in the consolidation of relevant memories
 vibhinn adhyayanon kaa yah kahana hai ki neend or smriti ke jatil kaaryon ke bich ek sah-sambandh he
 Harvard sleep researchers Saper and Stickgold state that an essential part of memory and practice consists of nerve cell pulmonary, which sends information to the cell body to be organized into new neuronal connections
 is prakriya kii maang he ki koi bahari jaankaree in drumashmon ko prastut nahin kii jaay or yah bhi kaha gaya ki sambhawatah isiilie neend ke samay smritiyaan or gyaan thos or vyavasthit hoti hai
 The principle of "preservation and preservation" holds that sleep functions adaptively
 din ke 24 ghanton ke un bhaagon main jab praani kii raksha karata he, jab vah jagaa hota he or isiilie aasapaas ghumta rahata he or jab vyakti bade jokhim main hota he
 The organism does not need 24 hours to feed and it meets other needs
 anukulan ke is drushtikon se, jeev nuksaan ke raste se dur rahete hai, jahaan ve anya sambhavit majboot jeevon kaa shikaar ban sakate hai
 They sleep at the same time which maximizes their safety, providing them physical ability and their accommodation
 
 However, this theory fails to explain why the brain breaks down with the external environment during normal sleep
 is siddhant ke khilaaf ek or tark he ki neend mahaj vaataavaran se pashuon ko alag karne kaa ek niskriy parinaam nahin he, balki ek "drive" he;neend lene ke kram main pashu apane vyavhaar main tabdili let he
 Therefore, circadian regulation is more than sufficient to explain the duration of activity and inactivity, which is adaptable to the organism, but even more peculiar peculiarities of sleep possibly serve other and unknown functions
 iske alaava, parirakshan siddhant ko yah vyakhya karne kii jarurat he ki singh jaise maansaahaari, jo khaadya shrinkhalaa main sabase upar hai or jinhen adhik bhay bhi nahin he, kyon bahut adhik soya karte hai
 It has been said that they need to reduce energy degradation when they are not on the hunt
 parirakshan siddhant isaki bhi vyakhya nahin karata he ki jaleey stanpayi chalate hue kyon soya karte hai
 Inactivity during these sensitive hours does the same and becomes more beneficial, as the creature is still able to meet environmental challenges like predators etc
 nidrahin raat ke doshapurn anukulan ke baad neend phir se palat kar aati he, lekin spasht rup se kisi kaaran se hi aati he
 At the time of his sleep, a zebra, which is trying to save its life from a lion, falls asleep during the day, which is no more vulnerable than being a victim
 neend ke dauraan samvedi chhaviyon or dhvaniyon ke anubhav ko mahasoos karne ko sapane dekhnaa kehete hai, anukram main aanevaale sapanom ko swapndarshi ek paryvekshak ke bajaay ek prakat bhagidaar kii tarah aam taur par mahasoos kiya karata he
 Dreaming is stimulated by pons and dreams occur mostly during the REM phase of sleep
 sapane ke kaary ke bare main logon ne anek avadharanaen pesh kii hai
 Sigmund Freud unquestionably believed that dreams are the expression of imperfect desires that are put or thrown into the unconscious mind and he used dream interpretation as psychoanalysis to discover these desires
 dekhen frid: da interpritesan of drims Freud's work deals with the psychological role of dreams, which clearly does not exclude any physical role that may be possible
 It is therefore not ruled out by the increasing modern interest in the organization and consolidation of recent memory and experience
 haal ke shodh kaa daawa he ki abhyaas or anubhav ke dauraan chetopagam samparkon ke samekan or vyavasthaapan kii samgr bhoomika neend kii he
 The activation synthesis theory of John Allen Hobson and Robert mccarley states that dreams are caused by the indiscriminate firing of neurons in the brain vulva during the REM period
 is siddhant ke anusaar, agramastishk tab saamanjasy sthapit karne or atarksangat samvedi soochna prastut karke arth nikaalane ke prayaas main ek kahani bunata he; isiilie anek sapane ajeeb prakruti ke hote hai
 The effective dose depends to some extent on prior use
 jaise-jaise iskaa asar khatm hone lagata he to yah satarkta main ek teji kaa karan ho saktaa he
 There are many reasons for poor sleep
 nimnlikhit swasthkar neend ke siddhant shaareerik yaa bhaavnaatmak samasyaon kaa hal ho sakate hai
 When the reason behind it is pain, illness, medicines, or stress, then its cause must be treated

 Many mammals sleep for a long time-to-long ratio every 24 hours
 haalanki, kiler whale kuch dolphin apane jivan ke pehle maheene ke dauraan nahin soti hai

 is prakaar kriya yoga ishwar-bodh, yatharth-gyaan evam aatm-saakshaatkaar praapt karne kii ek vaigyanik pranali he
 According to Paramahamsa Yogananda, Kriya Yoga is a simple psychic system, through which human blood is devoid of carbon and filled with oxygen
 iske atirikt oxigen ke anu jivan pravaah main roopaantarit hokar mastishk or merudand ke chakron ko navshakti se punah purit kar dete he
 Kriyayoga, which directs the mind through every vital force, is the simplest effective and most scientific way to reach the eternal
 baiylgaadee ke samaan dhimi or anishchit gati vaale dharmik margon kii tulana main kriyayog dwaara ishwar tak pahunchne ke maarg ko vimaan maarg kahana uchit hoga
 Further analyzing the process of Kriya Yoga, he says that many examples can be given of the mathematic relationship between different degrees of human breathing speed and consciousness
 man kii ekaagratha dhime shwasan par nirbhar he
 Fast or odd breathing, fear, work anger, etc
 are conducive to the state of harmful emotions
 jaisaa kii lahiri mahashay dwaara sikhaaya gaya, kriya yoga paaramparik rup se guru-shishy parampara ke madhyam se hi siikhaa jaataa he
 He recalled that, after his initiation into Kriya Yoga, "babaji guided me to those ancient rigid rules that govern the yoga art transmitted from Guru to disciple
 " As described by Yogananda to Kriya Yoga, "A Kriya yogi can mentally control his life energy so that he moves around the six centers of the spinal cord upwards or downwards which can be seen in the zodiac Twelve constellations correspond to symbolic cosmic humans
 manushya ke samvedansheel ridh kii haddi ke ird-gird urja ke dedh minute kaa chakkar uske vikaas main teevr pragati kar saktaa he; jaise aadhe minute kaa kriya yoga ek varsh ke prakritik aadhyatmik vikaas ke ek varsh ke baraabar hota he
 " swami satyanand ke kriya uddhran main likhaa he, "kriya sadhana ko aisa mana ja saktaa he ki jaise yah "aatma main rahane kii paddati" kii sadhana he"
 According to Yogananda, Kriya Yoga was well known in ancient India, but was eventually lost, due to priestly secrecy and man's indifference
 yoganand ji kaa kahana he ki bhagwaan krishna ne bhagavad gita main kriya yoga ko sanderbhit kiya he: By dedicating inward breaths to outward breaths and outward breaths into outward breaths, a yogi defies both these breaths; By doing this, he takes his life force out of his heart and takes it under his control
 yoganand ji ne yah bhi kaha ki bhagwaan krishna kriya yoga kaa zikr karte hai jab "bhagwaan krishna yah bataate he ki unhone hi apane purv avatar main avinashi yoga kii jaankaree ek pracheen prabud, vaiwaswath ko di jinhone ise mahaan vyavasthaapak manu ko sampreshit kiya
 He then imparted this knowledge to Ikshvaku, the father of the Surya Vanshi kingdom of India
 " yoganand kaa kahana he ki patanjali kaa ishaara yoga kriya kii ore hi tha jab unhone likhaa "kriya yoga shaareerik anushaasan, maansik niyantran or par dhyaan kendrit karne se nirmit he
 "and then when he says," Salvation can be attained through the pranayam which is achieved by breaking the order of prasavan and expiration
 " shri yukteshwar giri ke ek shishy, shri shailendra bijoy dasgupta ne likhaa he ki, "kriya ke saath kai vidhiyaan judy hui hai jo pramanit taur par gita, yoga sutara, tantra shaastra or yoga kii sankalpana se lee gayi hai
 " lahiri mahashay ke mahavatar babaaji se 1861 main kriya yoga kii diksha praapt karne kii kahani kaa vyaakhyaan ek yogi kii aatmakatha main kiya gaya he
 Yogananda wrote that in that meeting, Mahavatar Babaji told Lahiri Mahashi that, "this Kriya Yoga which i am giving to this world through you in this nineteenth century is a re-enforcement of the same science that Lord Krishna had centuries ago
 Gave it to Arjuna; and later it became known to Patanjali and Jesus Christ, St
 John, St
 Paul and other disciples
 " yoganand ji ne yah bhi likhaa ki babaaji or isa messiah ek duusare se ek nirantar samagam main rahete the or donon ne saath, "is yug ke liye mukti kii ek aadhyatmik takanic kii yojana banaai
 " lahiri mahashay ke madhyam se, kriya yoga jald hi bharat bhar main fail gaya

 Nakshatra time is a method of time measurement that astronomers use to see a particular constellation at night with the help of their visionary
 isse unhen pataa lagata he ki doordarshee kaa mukh kis samay kis disha main rakhane se vah nakshatra dikhaai degaa
 From one place of observation, the place where a star appears in the sky, the next night will be found in the same constellation time in approximately the same direction
 jis prakaar surya or chandramaa purv main ugte hue tathaa pashchim main ast hote hue maaloom padate hai, usee tarah anya nakshatra bhi
 Both 'solar time' and 'constellation time' are based on the regularity of rotation speed on the Earth's own polar axis
 samay kaa gyaan surya kii drishy sthitiyon se kiya jaataa he
 Generally, the day is from sunrise to sunset and night from sunset to sunrise again, but the day for tithinna is called night by day
 kisi sthaan par surya dwaara yamyottar vrutt ke adhobindu kii ek parikrama ko ek 'drishy din' kehete hai, tathaa surya kii kisi sthir nakshatra ke saapeksh ek parikrama ko 'nakshatra din' kehete hai
 According to this constellation convention, the initial point of measurement, that is, the spring coincident point of the ecliptic and equatorial circle is taken
 yadhyapi nakshatra din sthir he, tathaapi yah hamaare vyavhaar ke liye upyogi nahin he, kyonki yah drishy din se 3 minute 53 second kam he
 The value of visible day is not always the same
 at: kisi ghadi se drishy surya ke samay kaa bataaya janaa kathin he
 There are two reasons for this: one, the apparent motion of the Sun is not always the same, the other is that the apparent Sun is seen moving in the eclipse
 hamen samaysoochak yantra banane ke liye aise surya kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jo madhyam gati se sadaa vishuvatvrutt main chale
 Such astrologers call astrology astrology-mean-sun or simply mean sun
 vishuvatvrutt ke madhyam surya tathaa krantivrutt ke madhyam surya ke antar ko bhaskaracharya ne udayantar tathaa krantivrittiya madhyam surya tathaa spasht surya ke antar ko bhujaantar kaha he
 If the astrology-mean Sun performs Udayantar and Bhujantar rites, then that scene will become Surya
 aadhunik shabdaawalee main udayantar tathaa bhujaantar ke ek saath sanskaar ko samay sameekaran kehete hai
 This is similar to the difference between the time of our clocks and the time of visible sun
 samay samikar kaa prati din kaa maatr ganit dwaara nikaala ja saktaa he
 In the Sailor Almanac published today, its daily value is given
 is prakaar ham apni ghadiyon se jab chahen drishy surya kaa samay gyaat kar sakate hai
 It is used a lot in astrology
 vilomat: ham surya ke urdhv yamyottar bindu ke langhan kaa vedh karke, usamen samay samikar ko jod yaa ghataakar, vaastavik madhya-surya kaa samay gyaat karke apni ghadiyon ke samay ko thik kar sakate hai
 We told modern watches to measure time, then it was found that due to cold and heat these watches do not give proper time due to shrinking and spreading of metal parts
 ab hamaare saamne yah samasya thi ki ham apni yantric ghadiyon kii sookshm ashuddhiyon ko kaise jaane? yadhyapi surya ke urdhv yamyottar langhan kii vidhi se ham apni ghadiyon kii ashuddhi jaan sakate the, tathaapi surya ke urdhv yamyottar langhan kaa vedh swayan kuch vilsht hai tathaa surya ke bimb ke vishaal hone ke kaaran usamen vedhakarta kii vyaktigat truti kii adhik sambhaavna he
 The second difficulty was that the time of our mean-sun-clock had no direct relation with the position of the celestial bodies
 isi kami kii purti ke liye nakshatra ghadi kaa nirmaan kiya gaya, jo nakshatra samay bataati thi
 Its 24 hours are equivalent to the time of one orbit of the Earth's own axis, or one orbit of the posterior point of the spring point
 21 march ke lagbhag, basantpaat bindu hamaare drishy-surya ke saath urdhv yamyottar langhan karata he
 At that time the time of the sidereal clock is zero hour, zero minute, zero second
 hamaari ghadiyon main us samay 12 bajte hai
 In the afternoon on the second day, the time for the sidereal clock will be 4 minutes
 anya kisi bhi nichit din madhya-surya ke samay ko ham anupaat se nakshatra sam main, yaa nakshatra samay ko madhya surya ke samay main, parivartit kar sakate hai
 Sailor almanacs have tables of this type of time conversion
 is prakaar yadi hamen kisi prakaar shuddh samay denevaali nakshatra ghadi mil jaae, te hamen apni madhya ghadi ke samay ko shuddh rakh sakate hai
 Although the sidereal clock is also mechanical and it also undergoes mechanical error, it can be purified daily, as it has direct relation to the position of celestial bodies
 vah is prakaar he : koi grah va tara urdhv yamyottar bindu se pachim kii ore khagoleey dhruv par jo kone banaata he, use kalkon kehete hai
 Thus, the constellation is the spring of some spring
 kisi tara vaa grah kaa vishuvaansh basantpaat se uski vishuvatvritiya duuri dwaara surya athwa taron kaa vedh karke, kronometer naamak yantra kii sahaayta se, unke yamyottar langhan kaa nakshatra samay jaan liya jaataa he
 Combined with the sidereal clock, the constellation time of the planetary or star piercing in the telescope of the post-mortem device is determined by pressing the chronometer switch
 is samay se yantric ashuddhiyon ko nikaal dene par jo samay praapt hota he, vahi grah yaa taare ke yamyottar ke urdhv bindu ke langhan kaa samay hota he
 If the sidereal is right, it will be equal to the equinox of the planet or star and the difference is inaccuracy of the clock
 is prakaar nakshatra ghadi ko shuddh rakhkar usase madhya surya ghadiyon ko shuddh kiya jaataa he
 There is a greater possibility of personal inaccuracy in perforation by post-mortem instrument
 isliye taron ke yamyottar langhan ke nakshatra samay ko camera lage khamadhya doordarshkon se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Thus even though the mean time clocks are maintained properly, daily modifications to them were a problem
 isliye aajkal ghadiyon ke second suchak upkaran quartz ke crystalon se banaae jate hai
 Thermal effects on quartz crystals have little effect
 atev ye ghadiyaan bahut shuddh samay detii hai
 The inaccuracy of up to a thousandth of a second can be known
 saath is ghadi ko us tarah kii duusare steshnon par rakhi ghadiyon ke samay sanketak, pip, ko sunakar, milaayaa ja saktaa he tathaa isse samay sanketak pip bheje bhi ja sakate hai
 a watch of this type was proposed in 1953 for the proposed Sanskrit Kalaj Observatory of Kashi, which is now in Nainital

 There is pressure in air
 saadharantaya isaki anubhuti hamen nahin hoti
 If air is removed from any part of our body, then we feel the pressure of air easily
 samudratal par vaayu ke dabaav kii maatra 760 mimi paare se daab ke tulya hoti he
 As we rise up in the air, somehow the pressure decreases
 yahan tak ki kuch pahaad ke shikharon par dabaav kii maatra prati varg inch 9 pound bhaar tak pai gai he
 Air can also be suppressed
 dabaane se uskaa dabaav bad jaataa he
 Such suppressed air is called compressed air
 dabaane kii is kriya kaa 'sampidit karnaa' kehete hai
 Compression reduces the volume of air and increases the pressure
 is prakaar vaayu kaa dabaav kaaphi unchaa badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Compressed air is being used in a lot of work today
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki do sau se adhik kaamon main ho rahaa he
 It is said to be happening in over two hundred works
 tathaa din din bad rahaa he
 There is no danger in its use
 yah mashiinon dwaara prayek sthaan main badi saralata se pahunchaai ja sakati he
 Some of its machines are very simple and some are complex
 sampidit vaayu kaa upyog do prakaar se ho saktaa he : mashiinon main sampeedit vaayu taiyaar kar, kaamon main aisi vaayu sidhe lagaai ja sakati he, athwa sampidit vaayu silinderon main bharkar sanchit rakhi ja sakati he or aavashyaktaanusaar use bhinn-bhinn kaamon main lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Compressed air receiving machines are called air compressors
 vaayu ko sampidit karne kaa sabase saral upkaran bisikil yaa motorcar ke tubon main hawa bharne kaa vaayu pump he
 However, high pressure compressed air cannot be obtained from the air pump
 adhik dabaav ke liye zatil vaayu sampidak bane hai
 Initially, they were used to make tunnels by cutting mountains with compressed air-driven drills
 peeche rail ke brikon main bhi inkaa upyog shu degree hua
 Normal air compressors produce 60 to 100 pounds of pressurized air per square inch
 aise bhi sampidak bane hai jinase hajaaron pound dabaav kii vaayu praapt ho sakati he
 The compressor has a piston inside the cylinder
 silinder ke ek chor par do valve, ek bheetar kii ore khulanevaala or doosraa baahar kii ore khulanevaala hota he
 When the piston of the cylinder is pulled to the top end, the air pressure inside the cylinder decreases and the air from the atmosphere is pulled by this valve
 jab piston ko neeche kiya jaataa he, tab dabaav ke bad jane ke kaaran andar khulanevaala valve band ho jaataa he or baahar se khulanevaala valve khul jaataa he, jisase silinder kii vaayu nikalakar "vayukaksh" main chali jaati he
 By repeating this process several times, the air pressure of the leukocyte gradually increases
 upyukt dabaav kii vaayu ko nal dwaara nikaalkar kaam main laayaa ja saktaa he
 Air compressors can be divided into three categories: pratyaagmani vayusampidak adhik upyog main aate hai
 Their principle is the same as described above
 vaayu pump dwaara hi cycle or motor gadiyon ke tub main hawa bhari jaati he
 Tunnels can be made by drilling holes in the mountains with compressed air driven drills obtained from air compressors
 vaayu sampidak dwaara hi theatre, cinemagharon, badi badi imaaraton or khaanon main sanvathan kiya jaataa he, jisase ashuddh vaayu nikalakar uskaa sthaan shuddh vaayu le leti he
 Milling can also be done with this help
 sampidit vaayu se bade hathode chalaakar koyala, pathar, baaluu, kancreet aadi tode or pise jate hai
 Compressed air obtained from the air compressor can be riveted and iron and steel can be peeled
 sampidit vaayu kii sahaayta se bade bade jahaajon, vayuyanon, motorkaron aadi par polish ko ja sakati he or varnish chadhaai ja sakati he
 Cleaning of houses, whitewash of walls and varnish on rangis and furniture is done at a lesser cost with the help of compressed air from air compressors
 anek saamaanon kii safai tathaa makaanon kii buharai bhi isaki sahaayta se hoti he
 Rail brakes work with compressed air force
 sampidit vaayu kii sahaayta se anek saamaanon, jaise anaaj, koyale aadi, ko ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak bheja ja saktaa he
 The list of uses of compressed air is quite long
 sampidit vaayu kaa upyog aadhunik vigyaan kii ek mahatvapurn dein he

 samtawaad kaa darshan aisi vyavastha kaa samarthan karata he jisamen sampann or samarth vyaktiyon ke saath-saath nirbal, nirdhan or vanchit vyaktiyon ko bhi aatmavikas ke liye upyukt avasar or anukool paristhitiyaan praapt ho saken
 Egalitarianism considers all members of society to belong to the same chain in which strong links cannot remain unaffected by weak links
 uskaa daawa he ki jis samaaj main bhagyaheen or vanchit manushya dukhamay, aswasth or amanviya jivan jeene ko vivash hon, usamen bhaagyashaalee or sampann logon ko vyaktigat unnati or sukh samruddhi praapt karne kii aseem swatantraaa nahin di ja sakati
 In fact, egalitarianism wants to reconcile freedom and equality
 ise ek vivaaditsankalpana isliye kaha gaya he ki samanta ke kai swaroop ho sakate hai or logon ke saath samaan vyavhaar karne ke bhi anek tareeke ho sakate hai
 Some important questions arise when considering the philosophy of egalitarianism, such as 'what should be equal' and 'between whom should there be equality'
 ’ yahan samanta ke vitaranatmak pahalu se judaa ek mahatvapurn sawaal yah bhi he ki ‘kin chizon kii samanta honi chahie?’ haalaanki in sawaalon se jude vaad-vivaad ke sambandh main koi aakiri faisalaa nahin hua he par aam taur par vidwaanon ne samanta ko maapne ke teen aadhaaron ke bare main bataaya he : kalyaan kii samanta, sansadhano kii samanta or capability yaa samarthy kii samanta
 The theory of egalitarianism of welfare is mainly associated with the idea of utilitarians
 yahan ‘kalyaan’ ko mukhya rup se do tareekon se samajha jaataa he
 The first approach was pursued by classical utilitarian thinkers such as Jeremy Bentham
 inke anusaar, kisi vyakti dwaara anubhav kiye gayi dard yaa ksht kii tulana main anand kii kul maatra hi uski kushi he
 According to this view, in order to know about how happy a person is in his life, we should see how much happier he is
 kalyaan se sambandhit doosraa tarika upyogetavaad se sambandhit haal ke lekhan main dikhaai detaa he
 Welfare is associated with desire or preference-satisfaction
 logon kii kitni icchaayen yaa variyatayen santusht hoti hai— iske aadhaar par logon kaa kam yaa adhik kalyaan hota he
 In this basic sense, his life is better or worse
 har vyakti ko is baat main samarth hona chahie ki vah swatantra rup se apni variyatayen tay kar sake
 In fact, one who believes in the equitable distribution of social welfare, does not worry too much about how much resources a person gets
 lekin is baat kii chintaa zarur karata he ki ye sansaadhan prayek vyakti ke liye duusare vyaktiyon jitani santushti yaa kushi dete hai yaa nahin
 The important thing about this scheme is that it emphasizes that even if there is disparity in distribution of resources, every person should be equally well
 kalyaan samtawaadiyon se bhinn ‘sansaadhan samtawaad’ sansadhano kii samanta par bal detaa he
 John Rawls, Ronald Dworkin, Eric Rokowski, etc
 are considered resource egalitarian thinkers
 dwarkin maanate hai ki sansadhano kii samanta kaa arth yah he ki ‘jab ek vitaran yojana logon ko samaan maanate hue sansadhano kaa vitaran yaa hastantaran karti he, to aage sansadhano kaa koi bhi hastantaran logon ke hisse ko zyaada samaan banaaye
 'but at this place there arises a curiosity as to under which circumstances equality of resources can be achieved
 dwarkin is sandarbh main ek dwi-stareey prakriya ke bare main bataate hai : mahattvakanksha-samvedi nilaamee or beemaa yojana
 Dworkin has called the availability of the first option necessary in the resource-egalitarian concept
 iske liye ve ek sunsaan tapu par ek samaan pratibhashali vyaktiyon ke bich vahaan ke sansadhano ke bantwaare kaa udhaaharan dete hai
 If the auction process is adopted like a competitive marketplace by giving hundred clamshells to all individuals, then all the individuals will bid on the resources available there according to their preferences
 nilaamee prakriya khatm hone ke baad prayek vyakti ke paas icchit sansaadhan honge
 But here it is important that while imagining such a situation, all individuals had the same natural abilities
 lekin samaaj kii vaastavik sthiti aisi hoti nahin he
 For example, there are also elderly, physically challenged etc
 in society
 aisi paristhiti ke liye dwarkin ek beemaa yojana prastut karte hai jisamen is prakaar kii badakismati se nipatane ke liye kuch muawza de diya jaataa he
 For example, they can be given 125 clamshells instead of 100
 haalaanki dwarkin ke in vichaaron kii yah kah kar aalochana bhi kii gayi he ki har tarah ke prakritik nuksaan ke liye muawza nahin diya ja saktaa he
 But even then Dworkin has tried to make his delivery plan as competence-sensitive as well as ambition-sensitive
 jon rolls ko bhi ek mahatvapurn samtawadi vichaarak mana jaataa he
 John Rawls in his book a Theory of Justice has proposed two principles of justice
 unke pehle siddhant ko samaan swatantraaa kaa siddhant kehete hai jisamen unhone tark diya he ki prayek ko sabase vistrut swatantraaa kaa aisa samaan adhikaar praapt hona chahie jo dusron kii waisi hi swatantraaa ke saath nibhaa sake
 According to his second theory, social and economic inequalities should be arranged in such a way that they are of maximum benefit to the people with inferior status and these inequalities are associated with the positions and conditions which are accessible to all on the conditions of fair equality of opportunity
 rolls ne apane siddhant ko ek vishesh purvatakram main rakhaa he
 That is, the first principle is given priority over the second principle
 duusare siddhant main ko par praathamikta di gayi he
 In fact, here Rolls has not curtailed a person's freedom for other people's freedom
 parantu iske saath hi unhone is baat ko sunishchit kiya he ki samanta ke siddhant main kisi bhi tarah kaa hastkshep tabhi kiya ja saktaa he jab isse hinatam sthiti ke logon ke liye sabase zyaada faaydaa ho
 In fact, here, Rawls's egalitarianism seeks to reconcile freedom and equality
 samtawaad kii ek anya avadharana samarthy yaa capability samtawaad kii he
 It has been presented by Amartya Sen
 iske anusaar logon kii capability ko baraabar karne par dhyaan diya janaa chahie
 Capability is the ability to perform a certain type of task
 masalan sakshartaa ek capability he or padhanaa ek kaary he
 a resource- egalitarian can emphasize that in areas where there is a lack of literacy, people should be given resources like books and educational services
 duusari ore samarthy- samtawadi is baat par jor denge ki logon ko bahari sansaadhan uplabdh karaane se zyaada mahatvapurn yah he ki logon kii padhane-likhane kii capability yaa samarthy arthath aantarik kshamta ko badhaava diya jaye
 The most distinct of these is Michael Wolzer's idea of complex similarities
 wolzar kaa maananaa he ki samanta ko kalyaan, sansaadhan yaa capability jaisi kisi ek visheshta par dhyaan nahin dena chahie
 According to him, any distribution being just or unjust is associated with the social meaning of the goods that are being distributed
 iske saath hi saamaajik jivan ke sabhi daayaron main vitaran kaa ek jaisaa maanak nahin hona chahie
 For example, the market and political power are different
 isliye ve yah daleel dete hai ki ek daayre ke bheetar vastuon kaa vitaran uskaa aantarik masalaa he or adarsh rup main ise kisi duusare daayre ko prabhavit nahin karnaa chahie
 Egalitarianism remains an important consideration for social scientists even today
 parantu vaishvikaran kii raajnneeti ne punarvitaran ke kayakramon or rajya kii kalyankari nitiyon ko kamazor karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai he
 Apart from this, another specific political phenomenon has also emerged recently
 yah raajnneetik parighatna he : pahchaan ke aadhaar par bane samoohon kaa raajnneetik sangharsh
 Due to this, new concerns have also emerged in normative political theory
 ‘kis baat kii samanta?’ se sambandhit vaad-vivaad kaa sthaan ‘kinake bich samanta’ ne le liya he
 But socialists are increasingly giving up their personal prejudices
 ve ab samoohon kii asamantaaon par bhi gaharaai se vichaar kar rahe hai
