 Gyanranjan is a top storyteller in Hindi literature and editor of the Hindi well known magazine Pahal
 gyanaranjan kaa janm 21 november 1936 ko maharashtra ke akola main hua tha
 Most of the childhood and adolescence was spent in Ajmer, Delhi and Banaras and higher education was done in Allahabad
 lambey samay se unka sthaayee nivas madhyapradesh ke jabalpur main he
 Even today his favorite city is Allahabad
 jabalpur kaa sthaan uske baad hi aata he
 Gyanranjan is recognized as one of the best storytellers of the sixties generation
 saathottaree peedi ke 'chaar yaar' ke rup main prasiddh mandali ke chaaron sadsy -- gyanaranjan, doodhnath singh, kashinath singh evam rabindra kaaliya main se sabase pehle sarvaadhik prasiddhi gyanaranjan ko hi praapt hui; haalanki ye chaaron apane dhang ke shreshth kahanikar rahe hai
 As a published collection, Gyanranjan has published six story collections, but it is a well-known fact that his total number of stories is 25, which are published in a compilation called Sapna Nahi
 kam likhane ke sambandh main anek logon ne anek tarah kii baaten kahi hai
 Some spoke of a loss of experience, some considered a break before the next inning, and some an editorial compulsion of a magazine like Pahal; But in the eyes of Gyanranjan himself, the main reason to stop writing the story has been the test of bestness from his own perspective
 jo bhi likhen yaa to sarvottam ho yaa phir ho hi nahin
 That is why none of the 25 stories published in book form were judged by any valid reviewer as weak or worthy of neglect
 gyanaranjan saathottaree peedi ke lekhak hai or akahani main shaamil lekhakon ke mitra bhi
 Despite this, his stories have often been free from the shortcomings that led to 'sad'

 The irony of human relations in the hour is obvious

 In this critical statement of Chaudhary, a primary but comprehensive pattern of story-review spontaneously appears

 Apart from 'ghanta', stories like fathers, outcasts, fences around here and there have also created a pattern for their names
 kahaniyon ke atirikt anya vidhaon main bhi gyanaranjan ne jamkar nahin likhaa he
 According to the waves of the mind, only a few footbal creations have been happening

 This implies that Gyanranjan's total accumulated capital in numerical form is included in the two books, but qualitatively he has long been recognized as one of the best Hindi storytellers by almost all recognized critics
 gyanaranjan kii kahaniyaan bhartiya bhashaaon ke atirikt anek videshi bhashaaon main bhi anudit ho chuki hai
 In addition to Indian universities, the courses of several study centers in Osaka, London, San Francisco, Leningrad, and Heidelberg, etc

 a detailed study of interference works at the core of all instruments with large resolution power
 bhautik prakaashiki main is dhaaran kaa samavesh thomas yang ne kiya
 Interference after them has been used to express the homogenous or tajjanic effects of waves or vibrations of any kind
 sankshep main kisi bhi tarah kii tarangagati ke kaaran laharon ke takaraav se utpann sthiti ko vyatikaran kii sangya di jaati he
 Whenever two different wavelengths meet together on the surface of water or any other fluid, a state of interference can occur
 jahaan ek tarangasamooh se sambanddh laharon ke tarangashringon kaa duusari shrunkhlaa se sambhddhalaharon ke tanrgashringon se sammilin hota he, vahaan drav kii sataha kaa unnayan us sthaan par laharon ke swatantra or ekant astitv ke sambhav unnayanon ke yoga ke baraabar hota he
 When the wavelength of one of the waves ends at the wavelength of the other, the wave oscillation at the surface of the fluid is reduced and the yield gradient is equal to the difference between the elevation of one wave component and the gradient of the other
 dhwani main utpann vispand isi vyatikaran kaa ek saadhaaran rup he, jahaan do yaa do se adhik tarangasamooh, jinke tarangadairdhya main maamuli sa antar hota he, kareeb ek hi disha main agrasar hote hue milte hai
 The speed of light is waves
 kisi ekal prakashasrot se ni:sruth urja madhyam ke parshv main saan rup se bikhar jaati he
 If two independent sources of light from which waves of the same magnitude and integral art form continuously oscillate, are placed adjacent to each other, then the distribution of energy around the medium is not congruent, where the beak of one light is on the beak of the other light, Or the wavelength of one falls on the wavelength of the other, the amplitude increases there and the energy or light intensity of the amplitude also increases
 saath hi, yadi ek kaa tarangashring duusare ke tarangagart par gire, to parinami aayam shunya hota he or prakaash kii tivrata ghat jaati he
 The first state is called collateral interference and the second one is called destructive interference
 paardarshee thos ke patale patton or sabun ke bulabulon par prakaash kii kirnon ke padane par vyatikaran kaa spasht parichay mil saktaa he
 When rays of light fall on soap bubbles, or thin strips of lead, the rays from both their outer and inner surfaces are reflected and returned to the observer's eyes and in wavelets of light that reach the eyes from both sources, Due to the subtle differences in the arts, there is interference, due to which the effects produced are quite seductive and fascinating
 sabun kaa koi bulbula ekvarni prakaash main praaia: kuch kaali rekhaon se aavruth dikhaai padataa he
 The reason is that the two wavelengths of light at the black visible points, which come from the inner and outer surfaces of the bubble, respectively, almost or completely destroy each other's effects
 yadi bulbula shwet prakaash main dekha jaae, to hamen saamanyatya kaali rekhaayen nahin dikhaai padatin
 They are replaced by strips of color
 aisa isliye hota he ki vibhinn rang, jinke yoga se shwet prakaash kii utpatti hoti he bhinn bhinn tarangon ke hote hai, jisase bulbule ke kisi bindu par vyatikaran se rang ke keval ek ansh maatr kaa vinaash hota he or ujle prakaash ke shesh avyav batch rahete hai, jo aankhon par apana purna varniya prabhaav utpann karte hai
 There are some basic conditions that need to be met for the deviation
 inamen se kuch to prakaash kii prakruti main hi antarnihit he or duusari, yadi parinaam kaa prekshan prayog dwaara karnaa hua to, aavashyak ho uthati he
 For simplicity, we can consider two electromagnetic waves, which produce perishable interference at a point from where both waves pass
 yadi vyatikaran kaa praturup sthir rahaa, arthath yadi prakaash kii tivrata kaa parinami tathakthith bindu par samay ke prayek maan ke liye shunya ho, to nimnlikhit sharton kii purti aavashyak he : Two other conditions for successful observation of light-generated patterns, which must be met, are: yadi do atisannikat prakashasrot ke samaan pariman or kalantar kii taragen kisi kalantar vishesh par kuch dur sthit parde ke ek bindu par milen, to parde par kuch bilkul kii rekhaayen jinke antaraal main adhiktam tivrata kii rekhaayen rahati hai, dekhi jaati hai
 Those minimum and maximum intensity lines are called interpolation fringes
 jab kabhi vyatikaran fringen patali filmon ke chalate banati hai, tab unka kaaran vyatikaran main bhaag lenevaali kirnon ke kalantar kaa parivartan hota he
 This change is caused by a change of film thickness, or a change of volume angle
 yadi motaai samang nahin hui, to praaia: donon tathy ek hi saath kriyasheel ho uthte hai; lekin ek baat spasht he ki jab koi film aankh dwaara dekhi ja rahi he, to use aankh se kareeb 25 senmi
 kii duuri par rakhaa janaa chahie
 If the range of the film is not very large, the difference of the tilt of the rays coming from different points of the film to our eyes is not much and the volume angle of each ray is almost equal
 at: fringen mukhyat: film kii motaai kii bhinnata ke kaaran banati he
 It is also quite clear that at all the points of the film, where the thickness is the same, the light will be the same
 yadi aisa koi bhi bindu kaala yaa ujwal hua, to shesh bhi tadnurup kaale yaa ujwal honge
 Therefore, black or bright strips are just the point of different points of the film of the same thickness

 Algae, bryophytes, teridophytes, non-biotic and enanti-bic are present in the plant world
 shaiwal ke antargat lagbhag 30,000 jatiyaan hai or inhen aath mukhya upvargon main baantate hai
 Scientists now give them a higher place in the subclass space
 shaiwal ke upvarg hai : cynophita, chlorophita, euglinophita, carophita, fiophita, rhodophita, chrisophita or pirophita 
 Algae are very low quality plants from the idea of origin, in which root, stem and leaf are not formed

 alangik ritiyon main mukhyat: yaa to koshikaon ke tuutane se do yaa teen yaa adhik nae paudhe banate hai, yaa koshika ke jeevadravya ikattha hokar vibhajit hote hai or chalabijanu banaate hai
 These float out of the cell and float in the water and give time to give birth to new plants
 langik janan bhi anek prakaar se hota he, jisamen nar or maadaa yugmak banate hai
 It combines with each other to form a zygote, which over time generates new plants by cell division
 yugmak agar ek hi aakaar or naap ke hote hai, to ise samayugman kehete hai
 If the shape is different on the same shape, it is called asymmetric
 agar yugmak banane ke ang alag alag prakaar ke hon or yugmak bhi bhinn hon, to inhen visham yugmakata kehete hai

 Part of a category on Sikhism guru hargobind sikhon ke chhathen guru the
 Sahib has been praised in the Sikh history of Guru Arjun Dev Ji's son, Guru Hargobind Sahib, as a dal-bhanjan warrior
 guru hargobind sahib kii shiksha diksha mahaan vidvan bhai gurdas kii dekh-rekh main hui
 Guru ji was equally blessed with Baba Budaji
 chathe guru ne sikh dharm, samskruti evam isaki aachaar-samhita main anek aise parivartanon ko apni ankhon se dekha jinke kaaran sikhi kaa mahaan bootaa apni jade majboot kar rahaa tha
 Guru Hargobind Sahib gave protection to this great plant of heritage with his divine vision and gave it an opportunity to flourish
 apane pita shri guru arjuna dev kii shahidi ke adarsh ko unhone na keval apane jivan kaa uddeshy mana, balki unke dwaara jo mahaan kaary prarambh kiye gaye the, unhen safalataa purvak sampoorn karne ke liye aaajeevan apni patibaddhta bhi dikhalaai
 According to the changing circumstances, Guru Hargobindsaheb also took up the education of arms and scripture
 vah mahaan yoddha bhi the
 He had a wonderful practice of wielding a variety of weapons
 guru hargobindsahib kaa chintan bhi krantikari tha
 He wanted the Sikh community to be empowered to fight atrocities and oppression along with peace, devotion and religion
 vah aadhyatm chintan ko darshan kii nai bhangimaaon se jodna chaahate the
 Guru - He assumed the two swords of Miri and Piri as soon as he assumed the throne
 miri or piri kii donon talavaarein unhen baba boddaji pahanaai
 It is from here that Sikh history takes a new mode
 guru hargobindsahib miri-piri ke sankalp ke saath sikh-darshan kii chetana ko nae aadhyatm darshan ke saath jod dete hai
 In this process politics and religion became complementary to each other

 Jahangir's wife was a servant of Noor Jahanmiyanamir
 in logon ne bhi jahangir ko guru ji kii mahanata or pratibha se parichit karavaaya
 Baba Budav Bhai Gurdas also opposed the arrest of Guru Sahib
 jahangir ne keval guru ji ko hi gwalior ke kile se aaazaad nahin kiya, balki unhen yah swatantrata bhi di ki ve 52raajaaon ko bhi apane saath lekar ja sakate hai
 That is why in Sikh history, Guru Ji is called a prisoner and a donor
 gwalior main is ghatana kaa sakshi gurudwara bandi chhod he
 Guru ji fought with Shah Jahan four times while remaining firm on his life values
 ve yuddh ke dauraan sadaiv shant, abhaya evam adol rahete the
 He had so much military power that Mughal soldiers were often afraid
 guru ji ne mughal sena ko kai baar kadi paraajay di
 Guru Hargobindsaheb created an indomitable wave with his personality and deeds, which later created a new consciousness of devotion and power in the Sikh Sangat
 guru ji ne apni sujh-boojh se guru ghar ke shraddhaluon ko sugathit bhi kiya or sikh-samaaj ko nai disha bhi pradaan kii
 Akal Takht Sahib emerged as the supreme institution for the Sikh society, which concentrated Sikh power in the future and gave it a distinct social and historical identity
 iskaa shrey guru hargobindsahib ko hi jaataa he
 Guru Hargobindsaheb Ji was a very philanthropic warrior
 unka jivan darshan jan-saadhaaran ke kalyaan se juda hua tha
 This is why Gurmatidarshan reached every nook and corner of the nation during his time
 shri guru granth sahib ke mahaan sandesh ne guru-parampara ke un kaaryo ko bhi prakaashmaan banaaya jiske kaaran bhavishya main maanavtaa kaa maha kalyaan hone ja rahaa tha
 Due to these untiring efforts of Guru Ji, the Sikh tradition was also taking a new form and redefining the dignity of its heritage in new contexts
 guru hargobindsahib kii chintan kii disha ko nae vyaavhaarik arth de rahe the
 In fact it was the effect of his aura and power
 guru ji ke vyaktitv or krittitvaka gaharaa prabhaav puure parivesh par bhi padane laga tha
 Guru Hargobindsaheb used all his strength to establish the ideals of Harmandirsahib and Akal Takht Sahib
 guru hargobindsahib praaia: punjab se baahar bhi sikh dharm ke prachaar hetu apane shishyon ko bheja karte the
 Guru Hargobindsaheb not only linked Sikh life philosophy to contemporary problems, but also created a life vision that also highlighted the possibility of glorious solutions
 sikh lahar ko prabhaavshaalee banane main guru ji kaa adwitiya yogadan rahaa
 Guru Ji included Jyoti-plots in Kiratpur Sahib
 gurudwara patalpuriguru ji kii yaad main aaj bhi hajaaron vyaktiyon ko shaanti kaa sandesh detaa he
 Bhai Gurudas has mentioned the glory saga of Guru Hargobindsaheib in these words: Panj Pialepanjpeer Chhatampir Bait Gur Heavy, Arjuna Kaya Palat's idol Hargobindaswari, chali peedhisodhiyanrup dikhaavanavaaro-vaari, Dal Bhanjan Guru Surma Vadayodha is the ten guru of multi-benevolent teachings
 guru hargobind sahib ji jab kashmir kii yatra par the tab unki mulaakaat mata bhagbhari se hui thi jinhone pehali mulaakaat par unase poocha ki kya aap guru nanak dev ji hai kyonki unhone guru nanak dev ji ko nahin dekha tha
 He had made a big chola for Guru Nanak Dev Ji, which had 52 cloves, he had made this cloth a little bigger after hearing about him that his body is a little heavier
 mata kii bhaawanaaon ko dekhte hue guru sahib ne ye chola unase lekar pahan liya
 When Guru Sahib was freed from the fort of Gwalior, he wore this same chola, whose 52 kings, holding 52 buds, came out one by one in the prison of the fort, since then Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji called "donor Bandi Chod"
