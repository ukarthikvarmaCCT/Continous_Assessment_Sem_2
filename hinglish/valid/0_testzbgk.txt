 It is important to note that the ideal transformer does not generate energy or power, nor does it change power, nor does it change frequency
 parinamitra prayukt vidyut ke kshetra main Probably the most widely used vaidyut sashitr he
 All the credit for the predominance of the alternating current in the industries as compared to the direct current is only to the resultant
 yah aisa saadhitra he jo nimnavoltata kii ucch dhara ko ucch voltata kii nimna dhara main or ucch voltata kii nimnadhara ko nimnavoltata kii ucch dhara main parinamit karata he
 This result is accomplished with minimal loss of energy and without the aid of any moving part in the appliance
 100 volt kii 10,000 wat vidyutakti ke parinman ke liye 100 ampiore dhara aavashyak hoti he
 But only one ampere current at a voltage of 10,000 is sufficient
 at: duusari sthiti main pehali kii apeksha bahut hi kam vyasavaala or is kaaran sasta chaalak aavashyak hota he
 The conductivity of the transformer is based on a unique finding by Michael Faraday, according to which the induced conductor force in the circuit is equal to the time rate of change of magnetic flux across the region bounded by the circuit
 saralatam rup main parinamitra main do alag alag kundaliyaan hoti hai, jinka chumbakeey paripath ek hi hota he
 The coil of the transformer is identified according to the direction of flow of power
 praathmik kundali ko prayavarti vidyudurja ke strot se jodate hai or dwitiyak ko lod se
 Energy is transferred from the primary coil to the secondary coil by electromagnetic induction
 adarsh parinamitra ke kriyasanchalan kii visheshtaayen hai : In practice, this ideal situation is unpredictable
 parinamitra kii praathmik kundali se judi sambharan voltata chumbakeey flux utpann karti he, jo parinamitra ke patlit crode se sambhddha hoti he
 The alternating voltage Ep connected to the primary coil of the transformer is expressed as the density Bm of the highest magnetic flux, the area a of the transverse section of the lattice core, the frequency f of the alternating current of the alternating current, and the number of naps in the primary coil
 : praathmik kundali main pravaahit dhara dwaara utpann prayavarti chumbakeey flux dwitiyak kundali kii lapeton ko bhi sambhddha karata he
 The difference between primary and secondary coils is only the number of wraps, so the effective value of the induced voltage in the secondary coil is prakaar praathmik or dwitiyak voltata kaa nimnlikhit anupaat praapt hota he: The number of wraps in the primary coil N1 is kept less than the number of wraps of the secondary coil N2 when the voltage of the primary coil is required to increase
 is prakaar ke parinamitra ko ucchayi parinamitra kehete hai or praathmik kundali kii voltata yadi dwitiyak kii voltata se adhik he to praathmik kundali main lapeton kii sankhya N1 dwitiyak kundali kii lapeton kii sankhya N2 se badi hogi
 This type of transformer is called a catabolic transformer
 saamanyat: parinamitra kaa swaroop nimnlikhit baton se nirdhaarit hota he: The efficiency of a simple power transformer is very high at normal load, ranging from 90 percent in small units to 98 percent in large transformers
 saamaanya: pratishat main vyakt parinamitra kii dakshata ko is prakaar abhivyakt kar sakate hai : There is a difference in the instantaneous efficiency of the transformers and the efficiency throughout the day
 parinamitra ke niyantran kaa arth hota he nivesh voltata ke sthir rahane par purna lod kii sthiti main dwitiyak voltata or bina lod kii sthiti main dwitiyak voltata kaa sambandh
 When expressed as a percentage, control can be defined as: chote parinamitron ke liye niyantran 2 se 5 pratishat or bado ke liye lagbhag 1 pratishat ke kram kaa hota he
 The transformer mainly consists of two parts: 1) kor - jo kisi chumbakeey padaarth kii banaayi jaati he
 2) Winding - which is made of copper, aluminum or any other conductor wires or bus bar
 iske atirikt kuchaalak aadi bhi prayog kiye jate hai jo vinding ke pheron ko aapas main yaa kor se chhune se rokte hai
 Transformer oil is used in high voltage transformers which prevent sparks from exceeding breakdown strength and heat by cooling the core and coil
 parinamitra ko thanda rakhane ke liye tel ke alaava evam kai anya shitakon kaa prayog bhi kiya jaataa he jaise pani evam gas aadi
 Below is a list of some emerging technologies

 a review of the powers of knowledge is presented in this philosophy
 saath hi, 17veen or 18veen shatabdiyon ke indriyavaad evam buddhivaad kii samiksha he
 Kant agreed with the sensualists in the acceptance of the secondaryity of the Idris in the acquisition of material; He agreed with the intelligentsia in supporting the imperative of intelligence in converting the said material into ideas; But he did not agree with anyone in resolving one and supporting the other
 kaant ke mat main buddhi or indriyaan gyaan sambandhi do bhinn santhaan nahin hai, balki ek hi sasthan ke do vibhinn avyav hai
 To refer to Kant's philosophy as "altruism" is to regard it as "on" from sensualism and rationalism, and as the basis for every philosophical discourse
 uske darshan main buddhi dwaara gyey vishyon kaa nahin, swayan buddhi kaa pareekshan kiya gaya he or bahut hi vishad rup main
 In the detailed history of European philosophy, for the first and last time, through Kant, the Enlightenments have presented themselves in such detail
 is prakaar kii vyakhya kaa pratham nirdesh unani darshankaal main sucraat se praapt hua tha
 He had said: "know yourself", but after that all the efforts made to know yourself were spent in knowledge of other things beyond themselves
 aadhunik kaal ke prarambh main francisi vichaarak dekart ne phir balpurvak kaha– indriyaan vishwaas ke yogya nahin, ve bhram utpann karti hai; buddhi bhi nirpeksh vishwaas ke yogya nahin, vah asat nirnyon ko sat siddh kar detii hai; kintu "main vichaar karata hoon, atev main hoon", ek aisi pratiti he, jiske khandan kaa prayek praytn uski satyata kaa sakshya prastut karata he
 However, no thinker researched the Enlightenment "I", or the complex institution of intelligence
 yug kii pravritiyaan ganit or bhautikavigyaan ke prabhaavon se aakraant thim
 Tychobrahi and Copernicus had always pushed the earth sitting in the center of the world with the help of mathematics and put the sun in its place
 duusari ore galiliyon ne pisa ke jhuke hue stambh kii chotii se pattharon ko giraakar, prithvi kii dwividh gati kaa anusandhan kiya tha
 European thinkers were supporting the monopoly of the intellect or senses over the kingdom of knowledge by dividing it into two groups under these two influences
 ek ore german darshanik gotfreed wilhelm libenits ke anuyaayi the, duusari ore angrez vichaarak jon lock ke samarthak the
 However, seeing the plight of the era, thinker David Hume, a Scottish skeptic, then asked, where is the basis for supporting causality? In the web of events, there is nothing more obvious than just past relationship, co-ordination etc
 is baar, kaant kii pratibha jaagi or usne buddhi kaa pareekshan prarambh kiya
 From 1770 AD to 1781 AD, he contemplated the works of pure intelligence, declaring through the "critique der Reinen Vernunfut" that pure intellect synthesizes the senses
 isiilie prayek vaigyanik nirnay kaa sookshm vishleshan karne par bauddhik karne evam andrik do prakaar ke tatv uplabdh hote hai
 In the first part of the said review, he distinguished the material brought from the external world by the senses and the nature of its perception, while discussing the sensory perception
 usne bataaya ki bahya vastuen indriyon par jo prabhaav daalati hai, vah desh or kaal ke parichchhedon se mukt hota he, kintu, andrik bodh in parichchhedon ke bina sambhav nahin
 Thus he decided that these are two forms of realization, which each bodhasamagri has to accept as soon as it enters the senses
 kaant ne desh or kaal ko avaantar aakaar sthir karte hue, prahanubhaveey tatv kaha
 After so much transformation in the material from external world, the second department of intelligence, the Department of Economics starts its work
 is vibhaag ke kaaryon kaa vivechan buddhisamiksha ke duusare bhaag, "par vishleshan" main kiya gaya he
 He charges 12 titles to the country and material containing knowledge
 kaant ne arthbodh kii 12 oopaadhiyon ko chaar samoohon main vibhajit kiya
 The titles of unity, multiplicity and macroeconomics are quantifiable; The titles of power, prohibition and delimitation are qualitative; The prevalence-overwork, causality dependence and collectivity are relational; Probability impossibility, existential non-existence, inevitability, contingency make sense of type
 uparyukt 12 oopaadhiyon ke aarope ke falswaroop 12 prakaar ke bauddhik nirnay uplabdh hote hai– saamaanya, vishisht tathaa ekbodhak pariman sambandhi nirnay hai, sweekrutibodhak, nishedhbodhak tathaa aseemtabodhak nirnay gunbodh karaate hai; nirpeksh, saapeksh tathaa vaikalpik sambandh bodh karaate hai samasyamoolak, varnanaatmak tathaa ndehsuchak nirnay prakaarta kaa bodh karaate hai
 In this way, Kant established that in acquiring knowledge of the external world, the intellect transforms the material so much that after entering the senses the world does not remain the same as before
 atevam, use buddhigat vastu or bahya vastu main bhed karnaa padaa
 He called the term "nomena" of the object liberated from the discipline of the intellect and "phenomena" of the stuffed object in the said discipline
 is antar kaa taatpary yah dikhaanaa tha ki bauddhik roopaantar ke pashchaat satya gyey vastu praatibhasik ho jaati he
 Now in the third part, which he titled "parapsychology", he revealed that in the absence of the co-operation of the senses, a pure intellect without means is unable to gain knowledge of God, soul and cosmopolitanism
 kintu, kaant kaa uddeshy buddhi ko ukt vishyon ke gyaan main aksham siddh kar "agyanavaad" kaa pravartan karnaa nahin tha
 Therefore, Kant spent seven years tirelessly pondering the final decision to review his pure intellect
 ant main use buddhi ke aage badhane kaa maarg dikhaai diya
 As a result, in 1788 AD, he published the second review book
 yah "vyaavhaarik buddhi kii samiksha" thi
 Seven years ago, pure intellect entered into the inaccessible fields of soul, divine and cosmopolitan, by practical wisdom, with a path of moral experience
 kaant kii vyaavhaarik buddhi shuddh buddhi kii bhanti bahya prakruti ke tathaa apane swabhaav ke niyamon se simit na thi
 He was the intellect of an independent intellectual who was capable of self-regulation
 iskaa taatpary yah nahin ki vyaavhaarik buddhi ke siddhant se kaant habz ke vyaktvaad kaa samarthan karnaa chahta tha
 He had given freedom of self-government to the practical intellect, but according to such rules, which the world should be fair to human beings
 kaant ke darshan ke is str ko samajhane ke liye ek ore parmarth or vyavhaar kaa bhed samajhane kii or duusari ore saidhantik or naitik buddhi ke bhed ko samajhane kii aavashyaktaa he
 He considered altruism to be "on" the periphery of cognitive trade, which is why a review of theoretical thinking, which is true, results in "behavior", which is phenomenological
 kintu, uski drushti main naitik chintan saidhantik chintan se doorgaami he; kyonki vah saidhantik pratibandhon se mukt he
 Therefore, ethical thinking can reach subjects that are relevant to theoretical thinking
 kaant jise vyaavhaarik buddhi kahata he, sachmuch vah naitik buddhi he, bauddhik maanav kii swatantra sankalp shakti he
 It is in this context that Kant re-establishes the immortality of the soul and the existence of God
 saidhantik chintan in astitvon ke bina bhi apana kaam chalaa saktaa he, kintu inaki kalpana ke bina naitik chintan ke pair nahin jam sakate
 In the acceptance of the immortal soul is the acceptance of eternal life; Acceptance of God is acceptance of the performer
 inkaa saidhantik mulya bhale hi kuch na ho, kintu naitik mulya bahut bada he
 In moral thinking, the task of the intellect is to consider the problem of conduct
 isiilie kaant ne ise vyaavhaarik buddhi kaha tha
 But he was not supporting many intellectuals
 vah dikhaanaa chahta tha ki vishaybhed se buddhi bhinn roopon main viksit hoti he, bhinn niyamon ke anusaar kaary karti he
 In the scientific interpretation of nature, she expects co-operation of the senses and uses her 14 rules
 vahaan vah kisi aisi satta kaa samarthan nahin karti, jo uske 14 anubandhon ke anushaasan main na aa sake
 She takes the form of sankalpa as soon as instincts in moral thinking and believes in the truths that nourish karma
 kaant kii teesri samasya "sundar" ke aswaad main pravrutt buddhi kii gatividhi ke nirupan kii thi
 He undertook a "review of the decision" to do the work
 iske prakaash main aane kaa samay 1790 i
 tha
 According to Kant, the intellect takes the form of "judgment" as it is oriented towards "beautiful"
 vah "nirnay" ko shuddh buddhi or vyaavhaarik buddhi ke bich kii kadi maanata tha
 He held nature to be a matter of pure intellect and revealed the truth of nature and the research purpose of inevitability
 vyaavhaarik buddhi athwa sankalp kaa vishay "shubh" tathaa uddeshy swatantraaa kaa anubhav tha
 Now he describes the subject of the decision as 'rasnubhuti' and considers this realization as a state between inevitability and independence
 spashtat: nirnay main vah yatharth or adarsh kaa gathbandhan karana chahta tha
 To understand his idea, we have to put the beautiful imagination between knowledge and will
 vah "sudanr" ko gyaan maatr kii vastu nahin, sukhad vastu maanata tha, kintu us sukh ko jo "sudanr" ke prekshan se utpann hota he vah sansargavarjit maanata tha
 He has denied the inclusion and relation of quality, quantity and type in the definition of "beautiful"
 is prakaar kii rasanubhuti shuddh buddhi tathaa naitik aacharan ke bina sambhav nahin
 Therefore, he calls the imagination of "beautiful" the decision between knowledge and will
 kaant kii is sarvangin samiksha kaa uttarvarti vichaardhaaraon par jitna prabhaav padaa utana kisi aadhunik mat kaa nahin
 His idea of independence influenced Ficte, Schelling and Hegel
 kaant ke gyey or gyaat vastu ke swibhavbhed ne shopenhaar ko prabhavit kiya
 Loz's purposeful suffixism was the fruit of Kant's philosophy
 uske manovaigyanik evam vyavahaaravaadi vichaaron ko lekar laing, cimail or vihinger ne apane maton kaa vikaas kiya
 The criticism methods of Cohen, Natrop, Rickert, Husserl, Heidegger, Cassirer are based on Kant's own indications

 manushya hi aisa praani he jo is lok main paap or punya, dono karm bhoga saktaa he or moksh praapt kar saktaa he
 There are four main sects in Hinduism: Vaishnavism, Shaiva, Shakta and Smarta
 lekin zyaadaatar hindu swayan ko kisi bhi sampradaay main vargeekrut nahin karte hai
 In ancient times and medieval times, Shaiva, Shakta and Vaishnava used to fight among themselves
 jinhen madhyakaal ke santon ne samanvit karne kii safal koshish kii or sabhi sampradaayon ko paraspar ashrith bataaya
 In short, the main elements of Hinduism are the following: Hinduism - Hinduism - who? - Goshu Bhaktibhavedyasya Pranave ch steadha matih
 punarjanmani vishwaasah sa vai hinduriti smritah
 
 arthath-- gomata main jisaki bhakthi ho, pranav jiskaa poojya mantra ho, punarjanm main jiskaa vishwaas ho--vahi hindu he

 yadhyapi kuch log kai samskruti ke mishrit rup ko hi bhartiya samskruti maanate he, jabaki aisa nahin he
 The culture or religion which has not originated and developed on the land of India, how can that religion or culture be Indian
 hindu dharm ke siddhanth ke kuch mukhya bindu: According to Hindu scripture Upanishads, Brahma is the ultimate element
 wo hi jagat kaa saar he, jagat kii aatma he
 He is the basis of the world
 usee se vishwa kii utpatti hoti he or vishwa nasht hone par usee main villin ho jaataa he
 Brahm is one and only one
 wo vishwathit bhi he or vishwa ke pare bhi
 He is the ultimate truth, omnipotent and omniscient
 wo kalathit, nity or shaashvat he
 That is the ultimate knowledge
 brahm ke do rup hai : parabrahm or aparabrahm
 Parbrahma is infinite, eternal and devoid of body
 wo sabhi gunon se bhi pare he, par usamen anant satya, anant chit or anant anand he
 Brahma is not worshiped, because it is beyond worship and indescribable
 uskaa dhyaan kiya jaataa he
 Pranava is the 8 Brahmavakya, which all Hindus consider to be the ultimate holy word
 hindu yah maanate hai ki om kii dhwani puure brahmand main gunj rahi he
 It is heard when deep into meditation
 brahm kii pariklpana veydant darshan kaa kendriya stambh he or hindu dharm kii vishwa ko anupam dein he
 What is the relation between Brahma and God, the thinking of Hindu philosophy is different
 advait veydant ke anusaar jab maanav brahm ko apane man se jaanane kii koshish karata he, tab brahm ishwar ho jaataa he, kyonki maanav maaya naam kii ek jaadui shakti ke vash main rahata he
 That is, when the shadow of Brahma falls in the mirror of Maya, then the image of Brahma is shown to us as God
 ishwar apni isi jaadui shakti "maaya" se vishwa kii sristi karata he or us par shashan karata he
 Although God is with a negative force in this situation, Maya is not able to impress him, just as a magician is not surprised by his own magic
 maaya ishwar kii daasi he, parantu ham jeevon kii swamini he
 Although God is formless, but because of Maya, he can appear to us as many gods
 iske vipareet vaishnav maton or darshanon main mana jaataa he ki ishwar or brahm main koi fark nahin he--or vishnu hi ishwar hai
 According to the Nyaya, Vaishika and Yoga philosophies, God is the supreme and supreme soul, who is enlightened and is the creator and ruler of the world
 jo bhi ho, baaki baaten sabhi hindu maanate hai : ishwar ek or keval ek he
 It is both universal and reliable
 beshak, ishwar sagun he
 He is self-centered and the cause of the world
 wo puja or upasna kaa vishay he
 He is complete, eternal, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent
 wo raag-dwesh se pare he, par apane bhakton se prem karata he or unpar krupa karata he
 Without his will, not even a single leaf can move in this world
 wo vishwa kii naitik vyavastha ko kaayam rakhata he or jeevon ko unke karmon ke anusaar sukh-dukh pradaan karata he
 According to Srimad Bhagavadgita, he comes from time to time in the form of an avatar on the earth after a moral collapse in the world
 ishwar ke anya naam hai : parameshwar, paramatma, vidhaataa, bhagwaan 
 This god is called Musalman Allah, God, Christian God and Jews Yahweh
 hindu dharm main kai devtaa hai, jinako angrezi main galat rup se "gods" kaha jaataa he
 There can be three opinions about who these deities are: ek baat or kahi ja sakati he ki zyaadaatar vaishnav or shaiva darshan pehle do vichaaron ko sammilit rup se maanate hai
 For example, Krishna is considered to be the God under whom all other gods and goddesses are present and at the same time, all the gods and goddesses are considered to be the form of Krishna
 tisare mat ko dharmagranth manyata nahin dete
 Whatever be the thinking, these deities are integral to the colorful Hindu culture
 vaidic kaal ke mukhya dev the-- indra, agni, som, varun, rudra, vishnu, prajapati, savita or deviyaan-- saraswati, usha, prithvi, ityadi 
 Later Hinduism saw new goddesses - Ganesh, Rama, Krishna, Hanuman, Kartikeya, surya-chandra and planets and goddesses like - Durga, Parvati, Lakshmi, Sheetla, Sita, Kali, etc
 ye sabhi devtaa puraanon main ullikhit hai or unki kul sankhya 33 koti bataayi jaati he

 in sabake alaava hindu dharm main gaay ko bhi mata ke rup main puja jaataa he
 It is believed that the cow has a total of 33 Koti Devi gods
 hindu dharm manyataon main paanch pramukh devtaa poojaneey he
 These are different forms and powers of one God
 devataaon ke guru brihaspati maane gaye hai
 According to mythological beliefs, he was the son of Maharishi Angira
 bhagwaan shiv ke kathin tap se unhone devguru kaa pad paaya
 He protected the gods with his knowledge and mantra powers
 shiv krupa se ye guru grah ke rup main bhi poojaneey hai
 Thursday is the special day of worship of Guru Brihaspati Dev
 daanvon ke guru shukracharya maane jate hai
 His father was Maharishi Bhrigu, son of Brahmadev
 shukracharya ne hi shiv kii kathor tapasya kar mrit sanjivani vidya praapt kii, jisase vah mrit sharir main phir se praan phoonk dete the
 By the grace of Brahmadev, he is revered as the planet Venus
 shuukravaar shukr dev kii upasna kaa hi vishesh din he
 According to Hinduism, every conscious creature has an immaterial soul, which is eternal, latent, irrational and devoid of disorder
 hindu dharm ke mutabik manushya main hi nahin, balki har pashu or ped-paudhe, yani ki har jeev main aatma hoti he
 In the Bhagavad Gita, the characteristics of the soul are described by Lord Krishna as follows: kisi bhi janm main apni azaadi se kiye gayi karmon ke mutabik aatma aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 In the cycle of birth and death, the soul occupies itself as the next body without being insulted
 achche karmfal ke prabhaav se manushya kuleen ghar athwa yoni main janm le saktaa he jabaki bure karm karne par nikrusht yoni main janm lenaa padataa he
 The worldly cycle of birth and death ends only when the person gets salvation
 uske baad aatma apane vaastavik sat-chit-anand swabhaav ko sadaa ke liye paa leti he
 The human vagina is the only birth in which a person's deeds, sins and virtuous give fruit, and the attainment of salvation through action is possible
 aatma or punarjanm ke prati yahi dharanaayen buddha dharm or sikh dharm kaa bhi aadhaar he
 The sacred texts of Hinduism are divided into two parts - Shruti and Smriti
 shruti hindu dharm ke sarvocch granth hai, jo purnat: aparivartaneey hai, arthath kisi bhi yug main iname koi badlaav nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Memory texts may change according to country
 shruti ke antargat veda : rugveda, samaveda, yajurveda or atharvaveda brahm sutara va upanishad aate hai
 The Vedas are called Shruti because Hindus believe that these Vedas were recited by the divine to the sages when they were in deep meditation
 vedon ko shravan parampara ke anusaar guru dwaara shishyon ko diya jaataa tha
 Every Veda has four parts - Samhita - Mantra part, Brahmana - Granth - prose part, in which rituals are explained, Aranyak - in which other deep things are explained, Upanishads - In this, Brahma, Atma and their relation are discussed
 is
 agar shruti or smriti main koi vivaad hota he to shruti hi maanya hogi
 Except Shruti, all other Hindu scriptures are called Smriti, because they contain stories that people have memorized and written down from generation to generation
 sabhi smriti granth vedon kii prashansa karte hai
 They have a lower standard than the Vedas, but are easier to read and are read by most Hindus
 pramukh smriti granth hai:- itihaas--ramayana or mahabharat, bhagavad gita, puraana--, manusmriti, dharamshastra or dharmasutra, aagam shaastra
 There are 6 major parts of Indian philosophy - Sankhya philosophy, Yoga, justice, Vaiseshika, Mimamsa and Vedanta
 hindu dharmagranthon ke mutabik devtaa dharm ke to daanav adharm ke pratik hai
 But do you know that in mythological beliefs, the gods and goddesses are said to be the children of the same father, but different mothers
 iske mutabik dev-daanvon ke pita rishi kashyap hai
 At the same time, the name of the mother of the gods is Aditi and the name of the mother of the demons is Diti
 vishwa main adhiktam hindu jansankhya vaale 20 raashtra In ancient times the Aryans worshiped many deities with Vedic mantras and agni-yajna
 arya devataaon kii koi murti yaa mandir nahin banaate the
 The major Aryan deities were: Devaraja Indra, Agni, Soma and Varuna
 unke liye vaidic mantra padhe jate the or agni main ghi, doodh, dahi, jau, ityagi kii aahuti di jaati thi
 Prajapati Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are rarely mentioned at that time
 bharat ek vishaal desh he, lekin uski vishalata or mahanata ko ham tab tak nahin jaan sakate, jab tak ki use dekhen nahin
 This way many great men got attention, but twelve hundred years ago today, Adiguru Shankaracharya did a very important work for it
 unhonen chaaron dishaao main bharat ke chhoron par, chaar peeth sthapit uttar main badrinath ke nikat jyotipeeth, dakshin main rameshwaram ke nikat shringery peeth, purv main jagannathpuri main govardhan peeth or pashchim main dwarikapith

 Most Hindus are worshiped by idols of God
 unke liye murti ek aasaan sa saadhan he, jisamen ki ek hi niraakaar ishwar ko kisi bhi manachaahe sundar rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Hindus do not actually worship stone and iron, as some people understand
 murtiyan hinduon ke liye ishwar kii bhakthi karne ke liye ek saadhan maatr hai
 The places of worship of Hindus are called temples
 pracheen vaidic kaal main mandir nahin hote the
 The worship was then in place of fire in which a gold idol was installed as a symbol of God
 ek najariye ke mutabik buddha or jain dharmon dwaara buddha or mahavir kii murtiyon or mandiron dwaara puja karne kii vajah se hindu bhi unase prabhavit hokar mandir banane lage
 Every temple is worshiped by one or more deities

 The temples are the best symbols of ancient and medieval Indian art

 He is also known as 'man Singh I'
 raja bhagavaandas pita the
 He was the chief commander in Akbar's army
 unhone amer ke mukhya mahal ke nirmaan karaayaa
 The great historian Colonel James Tod has written- "mansingh, the heir of Bhagwan Das, was given the best position in the court of Akbar
 

maansingh ne urisa or assam ko jeet kar unako badshaah akbar ke adheen bana diya
 raja maansingh se bhaybheet ho kar kabul ko bhi akbar kii adheenta sweekaar kerani paddy thi
 As a result of these actions, Mansingh was appointed as the ruler of Bengal, Bihar, South and Kabul
 " When Akbar's general Man Singh Solapur was returning after conquering Maharashtra, Mansingh thought of meeting Pratap
 pratap us vaqt kumbhalgarh main the
 Maharana Pratap had to manage his welcome on the sails of Udaisagar in Udaipur after passing his kingdom within Mewar
 After the reception and mutual interaction, it was time for lunch
 maharaja maansingh bhojan ke liye aaye kintu maharana ko na dekh kar aashcharya main pad gayi
 When he asked Maharana's son Amarsingh for this reason, he told that 'maharana saheb has a headache, so he is unable to support you on food
 ' According to some historians, this incident also became the reason for the battle of Haldi valley
 akbar ko rana pratap ke is vyavhaar ke kaaran mewar par akraman karne kaa ek or mauka mil gaya
 In 1576 AD, he was set on a campaign to punish Maharana Pratapsingh
 mughalon kii vishaal sena tiddi dal kii tarah mewar kii ore umad padi
 It also had Akbar's tremendous artillery with Mughal, Rajput and Pathan warriors
 akbar ke prasiddh senapati mahavat khan, asaf khan or maharaja maansingh ke saath akbar kaa shahjada saleem us mughal sena kaa sanchaalan kar rahe the, jisaki sankhya itihaaskaar 80 hajaar se 1 lakh tak bataate hai
 Rana Pratap fought that huge Mughal army with a handful of soldiers
 haldi ghati kii pili bhoomi raktranjit ho uthi
 On June 21, 1576 AD, seventeen thousand soldiers were killed in this fierce battle of one day between Pratap and the Mughal army in the Haldi valley near Gogunda
 yaheen rana pratap or maansingh kaa aamanaa-saamana hone par donon ke bich vikat yuddh hua - chetak kii peeth par savaar pratap ne akbar ke senapati maansingh ke hathi ke mastak par kaale-nile rang ke, arabi nasl ke ashv chetak ke paanv jamaa die or apane bhaale se sidhaa raja maansingh par ek pralayankari waar kiya, par tatkaal apane hathi ke majboot haude main chipak kar neeche baith jane se is yuddh main unki jaan batch gayi- houdah pratap ke durgharsh waar se buree tarah mud gaya
 Later, when Rana Pratap went away from the battleground of Haldighati on serious injuries, King Mansingh reached his palace and sent one of Pratap's famous elephant elephant Ramprasad to agra-darbar with other loot
 parantu maansingh ne chittorgarh ke nagar ko luutane kii ajna nahin di thi, yah jaan kar badshaah akbar in par kaaphi kupit hua or kuch vaqt ke liye darbar main inke aane par pratibandh tak laga diya
 In the words of James Todd- "in the days when Akbar was horribly ill and feared to die, Mansingh Khusro had laid a web of conspiracies to place him on the Mughal throne
 

uski yah cheshtaa darbar main sab ko gyaat ho gayi or vah bengal kaa shaasha bana kar bhej diya gaya
 After he left Khusro was imprisoned and kept in prison
 maansingh chatur or doordarshee tha
 He secretly supported Khusro
 Mansingh had an army of twenty thousand Rajputs under his control
 isliye badshaah prakat rup main uske saath shatruta nahin kii
 kuch itihaaskaaron ne likhaa he- "akbar ne das karod rupee de kar maansingh ko apane anukool bana liya tha
 " akbar shashan main jab raja bhagwantdas punjab ke soobedaar niyat hue, tab sindh ke paar seemaant praant kaa shashan unke kunwar maansingh ko diya gaya
 When Akbar's half-brother Mirza Muhammad Hakim died in his 30th year, Mansingh swiftly arrived in Kabul and got the residents there to get rid of the looting that followed the demise of the ruler and his sons Mirza Afrasiyab and Mirza Kankuvad of the kingdom
 He came to the court with other warlords
 akbar ne sindh nadi par kuch din thahar kar kunwar maansingh ko kabul kaa shashankarta niyukt kiya
 They bravely wiped out the robbers who were mercilessly holding the pass of Khyber
 jab raja birbal swaad praant main yousufajai ke yuddh main maare gaye or jainakhaan coca or hakeem abul fatah darbar main bula liye gaye, tab yah kaary maansingh ko saunpa gaya
 Jabulistan's rule in Afghanistan was first appointed by his father Bhagwant Das and later by his kunar Mansingh
 raja bhagavaandas kii mrityu ho jane par raja maansingh jaipur ke singhaasana par baitha
 karnal james tod ne likhaa he- "maansingh ke shasankaal main amer rajya ne badi unnati kii
 mogul darbar main sammanit ho kar maansingh ne apane rajya kaa vistaar kiya usne anek rajyon par akraman kar ke jo aparimit sampatti luti thi, uske dwaara amer rajya ko shaktishaalee bana diya
 dhaularai ke baad amer, jo ek maamuli rajya samajha jaataa tha, maansingh ke samay vahi ek shaktishaalee or vistrut rajya ho gaya tha
 In the history of India, the Kachhwahs were not considered as knights, but during the time of King Bhagwan Das and Mansingh, the Kachwaha people showed their strength, might and glory from Khutan to the sea
 maansingh yon akbar kii adheenta main zarur tha, par uske saath kaam karne vaali rajput sena, badshaah kii sena se kahin adhik shaktishaalee samajhi jaati thi"
 Some other historians do not agree with this about Colonel James Tod
 His statement is that Mansingh was not the adopted son of Bhagwan Das, but he was the son of Bhagwant Das
 bhagavaandas or bhagwant das donon bhai the
 Mughal-history books reveal that on the orders of Akbar, his experienced officers Maharaja Mansingh, local subedar Qutubuddin Khan and Raja Bhagwant Das of Amer made a lot of research to capture Maharana Pratap in the forests of Gogunda and Mewar but eventually failed Akbar became very angry - even in the year 1577, both of them were 'locked up' diyodhi! " "muslim itihaaskaaron ne likhaa he hijri 1024 san 1615 isvi main maansingh kii bengal main mrityu hui, parantu duusare itihaaskaaron ke vivaran se pataa chalata he ki maansingh uttar kii taraf khilji badshaah se yuddh karne gaya tha jahaan vah san 1617 isvi main maaraa gaya
 


 After Mansingh's death, his son Bhavsingh ascended the throne

 This theory evolved from the concept of continental displacement, envisaged in the first decade of the twentieth century, when new evidence was discovered in the 1960s that strengthened the concept of continents being dynamic rather than static
 in saakshyon main sabase mahatvapurn hai purachumbakatv se sambandhit sakshya jinase sagar nital prasaran kii pushti hui
 The discovery of Sagar Nittal Varshan by Harry Hayes is believed to be the beginning of the rendering of this theory and scholars like Wilson, Morgan, mckenzie, Oliver, Parker etc
 contributed to its promotion by providing evidence in its favor

 Wagner was the first to use the term "continental displacement", following the same principle of Wagner that the development of plate tectonics was possible, although his ideas were also rejected by scholars for nearly half a century until evidence was available in the 1960s
 
 or mahadwipiya visthaapan Due to the mobility of the plates, there are three types of edges or borders: is prakaar ke kinaaron ke sahare do platen ek duusare kii ore gati karti hai or takaraakar unamem se baari plate halaki plate ke neeche kshepit hoti he
 This part, which is twisted downward, goes deep and melts and converts into magma due to the excess of heat and pressure
 jis gaharaai par yah ghatana hoti he use kshepan mandal yaa beniof zone kehete hai
 With the help of such edges, due to pressure of the landowners, they turn and form mountains
 neeche jaakar pighla padaarth megma plum ke rup main upar uth kar jwalamukhiyata bhi utpann karata he
 Where two plates move opposite to each other, that is, they move away from each other, magma rises up from the bottom to form a new plate

 Rift valleys are formed when this shore lies on a continent
 nayi plate ke nirmaan ke kaaran ise rachanaatmak kinaaraa bhi kehete hai
 The protective edge is the one with which the two platens are moving, rubbing each other, that is, neither descending nor converging
 saamanytah is kinare ke sahare ek duusare ko ragadate huye vipareet dishaao main gatisheel hoti hai kintu yah anivaary nahin he, yadi do platen ek hi disha main gatisheel hon or unki gati alag-alag ho tab bhi unke kinare ragadate huye sangrakshi kinaaraa bana sakate hai
 Transform faults are found on their support

 Plate tectonics theory offers the newest explanation of the construction of fine mountains
 udhaaharan ke liye alpine parvat tantra ke parvaton kii utpatti kii vyakhya ko prastut kiya ja saktaa he
 According to this theory it is believed that the series of mountains on the northern and southern sides of the Mediterranean Sea are the result of tectonic events in the Tertiary era in which they were formed by compression between the African and European plates of sediments deposited in the Tethys Sea

 There is a layer of greenhouse gases around the Earth
 in gaison main carbon dioxide, methane, nitras oxide shaamil hai
 These gases heat the surface of the Earth by exploiting the energy of the sun
this is causing the Earth's climate change

 In the case of high temperatures, this mass balance of glaciers becomes negative, that is, the ice tends to melt in the lower parts than the snow is generated and as a result the glaciers move backwards, which is called glacial retreat
 
 iske vipareet taapmaana main kami aane par himand kii lambaai badhati he
 Apart from the above general reason, changes in glacial length depend on many other natural processes and external conditions
 isi kaaran, taapmaana, varshan, himandeey or uphimandeey jalavigyaan ke tatv milakar kisi ek ritu main bhi himand kii lambaai ko vividh tareekon se prabhavit kar sakate hai
 This is why the trend of change in size is seen by averaging the data over a sufficient period of time to draw conclusions about the climate based on the length of glaciers, so as to remove the effect of short-term deviations
 Taxes can only be used to differentiate climate change

 In these eras of geological history, this cyclic asymmetry is seen in the glacial spreading zone due to orbital deviations, however, some processes have also been found that have caused evidence of climate change possible even without orbital deviations

 ARM, x86 Symbian OS is an operating system designed for mobile devices and smartphones, with related libraries, user interfaces, frameworks and referenced implementations of common devices, originally developed by Symbian Limited
 yah Psion ke EPOC kaa vanshaj he or vishesh rup se keval ARM procesar par chalata he, haalanki ek bina jari kiya hua x86 port maujuud tha
 In 2008, the former Symbian Software Limited was acquired by Nokia and established a new independent non-profit organization called the Symbian Foundation
 Symbian OS and related user interfaces, S60, UIQ and MOAP were donated by its owners to the organization with the aim of making the Symbian platform a royalty-free, open source software
 The platform was named as the successor to the Symbian OS after the official inauguration of the Symbian Foundation in April 2009
 In February 2010, the Symbian platform was officially made available as open source code
 simbian OS par aadhaarit upkaran, smartphone kii bikri main 46
9% kaa yogadan dete hai, jiske kaaran yah duniya kaa sabase lokapriy mobile oparating system ban gaya he
 Symbian computers, like other operating systems, include preemptive multitasking and memory protection features
 epoc's approach to multitasking is inspired by VMS and is based on server-based asynchronous events
 simbian OS ko system ke teen dizin siddhanton ko man main rakhkar banaaya gaya tha: To best follow these principles, Symbian uses a microkernel, has a request-and-callback approach to services and maintains distance between the engine and the user interface
 OS kam shakti bydaree aadhaarit upkarnon or ROM aadhaarit pranali ke liye anukulit he
 Applications and the OS itself follow an object-oriented design: model-view-controller bazaar kii maang ko madde nazar rakhte hue baad kii OS punrariti ne visheshkar ek real-time-karnal or 8 or 9 ke sanskarnon main ek plateform suraksha model ko pesh karne ke saath is paddati ko mand kar diya
 There is strong emphasis on conserving resources cited by Symbian specific programming eclipses such as descriptors and a cleanup stack
 yahaan discs spes ko sangrakshit karne ke liye samaan takneekein maujuud hai 
 iske alaava, sabhi simbian programing ghatana-aadhaarit hote hai or jab anuprayog ghatnaon se pratyaksh rup se bartaav nahin karte hai tab CPU ke switch ko ek kam power mod main rakhaa jaataa he
 This can be achieved by a programming eloquence called active objects
 samaan rup se threads or prakriyaaon ke prati simbian kaa drushtikon overhedon ko kam karne ke dwaara sanchalit he
 The Symbian kernel supports sufficiently fast real-time response to build a single-core phone around it — a phone in which a single processor core executes both user applications and the signaling stack

1%, Microsoft ke 8
8% or Android ke 4
7% rahe
 anya pratiyogiyon main palm OS, qualkom kaa BREW, savaje, Linux or monavista software shaamil hai
 Although the global market share of smart phones declined from 52
4% in 2008 to 47
2% in 2009, the shipping volume of Symbian devices increased by 4
8%, from 74
9 million units to 78
5 million units
 
 simbian system model main upar se neeche tak nimnlikhit str, shaamil hai: The base service level is the minimum level reached by user-side operations; It includes a file server and user library, a plug-in framework that manages all plug-ins, stores, central stores, DBMS and cryptographic services
 isamen text windo sarwar or text shail shaamil he: yah do buniyadi sevaayen hai jinamein se bina kisi ucch str sevaaon ke purnatah kaaryaatmak port banaaya ja saktaa he
 Symbian has a micro-kernel design, which means that the minimum requirement to maximize robustness, availability, and responsiveness is within the kernel
 isamen ek anusuchak, smriti prabandhan or upkaran chaalak he, lekin anya sevaayen jaise netwarking, telephoni or file pranali samarthan ko OS seva ke str yaa buniyadi seva str par rakhaa gaya he
 The induction of device drivers indicates that this kernel is not a true micro-kernel

 Symbian is designed to emphasize customization with other devices, especially with removable media file systems
 The early development of EPOC has led to the adoption of FAT as an internal file system and is sustained, but an object-oriented persistent model is placed over the underlying FAT to provide a POSIX style interface and a streaming model 
 aantarik data swaroop apis par hi bharosa karte hai jo sabhi jod-tod kii hui filon ko chalaane ke liye data taiyaar karata he
 This resulted in data dependencies, and associated difficulties with changes and data transfers

 inamen se prayek main ek plag-in yojana he
 For example, ESOCK allows a separate "PRT" protocol module to implement different networking protocol schemes
 The subsystem also has code that supports short-distance communication links, such as Bluetooth, irda, and USB
 vahiin upyogkarta interfes code kii bhi badi maatra he
 Symbian OS contained only base classes and sub-infrastructure, while most of the actual user interfaces were maintained by third parties
 ab yah maamla nahin he
 Three major ones - UI - S60, UIQ and MOAP - were offered to Symbian in 2009
 simbian main graphics, text leout or font pratipaadan librari shaamil hai
 All native Symbian c ++ applications are made up of three framework classes defined by the application's architecture: an application class, a document class, and an application user interface class
 These classes create fundamental application behavior

 Many other things do not yet fit into this model - for example, syncml, Java ME, which provide a separate set of apis in addition to most oss and multimedia
 inamen se kai fremaworks hai or vikritaon se yah ummid kii jaati he ki ve tritiy paksh se in fremaworks ko plag-in kii aapurti kare 
 iskaa yah laabh hota he ki aise kaaryashiltaa vaale kshetron main apis kai phone modelon par ek hi hota he or isse vikritaon ko bahut lacheelaapan miltaa he
 But this means that phone vendors need to do a lot of integration work to make a Symbian OS phone
 simbian main "techview" naamak ek sandarbh upyogkarta interfes shaamil he
 This provides a basis for starting customization and is an environment in which a lot of Symbian testing and example code runs
 yah Psion series 5 vyaktigat aayojak ke upyogkarta interfes se bahut miltaa he or kisi utpaadan phone upyogkarta interfes kii tarah istemaal nahin kiya jaataa
 In 1980, Psion was founded by David Potter
 EPOC, Psion dwaara portable upkaran, mukhya rup se PDA ke liye viksit ek graphical oparating system kaa ek parivaar he
 The name EPOC originated with Epoch, meaning the beginning of an era, but the name was reworked by engineers under the name "electronic Peace of Cheese"
 EPOC16, jise mul rup se EPOC ke naam se janaa jaataa he, Psion dwaara viksit kiya gaya ek oparating system he jise 1980 ke dashak ke uttarardh yaa 1990 ke dashak ke purvardh main Psion ke "SIBO" upkaran ke liye banaaya gaya
 sabhi EPOC16 upkarnon main pramukh rup se ek 8086-pariwarik sansadhak or ek 16-bit sanrachana hoti he
 EPOC16 was a single-user preemptive multitasking operating system, written in Intel's 8086 assembler language and c and designed to be delivered in ROM
 It supported a simple programming language called Open Programming Language and a coordinated development environment called OVAL
 SIBO upkarnon main MC200, MC400, siries 3, 3a siries, 3C siries, 3mx siries, siena, varuabout or varuabout mx shaamil the
 The first EPOC16 equipment, the MC400 and MC200, was shipped in 1989
 EPOC16 kii visheshta mukhya rup se 1-bit prati pixel, kunjeepatal-sanchalit graphical interface thi
 
 1990 ke dashak ke utraardh main, oparating system ko EPOC16 ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa tha taaki usame or Psion ke us samay nae EPOC32 OS main bhed kiya ja sake
 The first version of EPOC32, Release 1, appeared on Psion Series 5 ROM v1
0 in 1997
 Later, Release 3 came prominently featured in ROM v1
1, Psion Series 5mx, Revo / Revo Plus, Psion Series 7 / Netbook and Netpad
 EPOC32 oparating system kaa naam baad main badal kar simbian OS rakhaa gaya, ise us samay keval EPOC ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Due to this confusion over the names, EPOC16 was known as SIBO to distinguish it from the "new" EPOC, before the Symbian name was given
 naam ek jaise hone ke baavjood EPOC32 or EPOC16 purnataya do alag oparating system the, EPOC32 ko c + + main ek naye kodebes main likhaa ja rahaa tha jiske vikaas kii shuruyaat 1990 ke dashak ke madhya se ho gayi thi
