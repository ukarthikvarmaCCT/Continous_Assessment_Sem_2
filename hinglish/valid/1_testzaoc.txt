 kumaun motor oners union limited, jo apane sankshipt naam keemoyu yaa kemu se adhik prasiddh he, uttrakhand ke kumaun kshetra main bas seva pradaan karne vaali ek nijee company he
 This motor company, which came into existence in 1939 by the merger of 13 private companies, was the only bus company to run buses in the pre-independence Kumaon region
 1987 tak yah is kshetra kii sabase badi bas company thi
 Motor traffic in Kumaon region first started in 1915 AD between nainital-kathgodam
 iske pashchaat 1920 i main kathgodam-almoda ke madhya motor yatayaat shuru hua
 In 1920, Munshi Lalta Prasad Tamta of Almora started a company called 'hill Motor Transport Company', under which the lorries ran from Haldwani and Kathgodam to Almora and Ranikhet
 kuch samay baad ek duusari choti company ‘da kumaun motor sarvice company’ prarambh hui, jo ki san 1922 ke uttararddh main sarvashree devi laal shah ganga ram ko hastantarit kar di gayi
 After some time the third company opened as 'nainital Motor Transport Company'
 ye company ‘british india karporation company’ kii ek shakha thi
 : 10 'nainital Motor Transport Company' had a fleet of 88 vehicles
 :12 san 1922 main thekedaar, sarvashree narayan das hansraj dwaara chauthi company prarambh kii gayi

 The measurement of the magnitude of a physical amount in numbers is called measurement
 maapan multah tulana karne kii ek prakriya he
 In this the amount of a physical amount is compared to a predetermined quantity
 is purvanirdhaarit maatra ko us raashi-vishesh ke liye maatrak kaha jaataa he
 For example, when we say that the height of a tree is 10 meters, we are comparing the height of that tree with one meter
 yahan meter ek maanak maatrak he jo bhautik raashi lambaai yaa duuri ke liye prayukt hota he
 Similarly, unit of time is second, unit of mass is kilogram etc
 lord kelvin kaa nimnlikhit kathan maapan ke mahatv ko pratipaadit karata he- One way to classify measurements in research methodology is to determine the level of measurement
 chunki maapan main gunon ko sankhyaon dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he or sankhyaon ke kuch prakritik or mul gun hote hai jaise - unki ananyta, kramikta, nishchit antaraal par sthit hona ityadi; ham maapan kaa vargeekaran is aadhaar par kar sakate hai ki usamen sankhyaon ke kitne gunon kaa samavesh kiya gaya he
 On this basis, psychologist Stanley Smith Stevens gave four levels of measurement - nominal measure, ordinal measure, interval measure and ratio measure
 in shreniyon kaa prayog shodh kaaryon main hota he or vahaan yah kisi pariklpana ke satyata pareekshan ke liye prayog main laayi ja rahi sankhyikeey vidhiyon ke chayan main mahatvapurn hota he
 For example, if a measurement is at a nominal or ordinal level, a parallel mean cannot be derived to find the average of the available data
 Only polymer can be used
 prakritik vishyon kaa adhyayan karte samay unke bare main sahi gyaan praapt karne ke liye yah aavashyak he ki ham prakruti ke kuch gunon kii maap karen
 Generally it has been found that three quantities, length, weight and time, are mainly available in the measurement
 saidhantik rup se prayek maap main uparyukt rashiyaan hi aati hai
 To measure any of these quantities, a certain and convenient quantity is considered standard
 isamen puri maatra maap lee jaati he
 We consider this unit, or unit, or unit of that particular amount
 udhaahranswaroop, arth ko ham rupe main ginate hai tathaa taul ko kilogram main
 Different types of units are used
 vigyaan main lambaai, bhaar or samay ko mul ikai kii sangya di gai he, kyonki ye teenon rashiyaan ek duusare par nirbhar nahin karti hai
 All other types of units have their base units
 in anya ikaayiyon ko vyatpann ikaayiyon kii sangya di gai he
 Thus, the unit of area is the area of a square that has one length and also one width
 aaytan kii ikai ek aise dhan kaa aaytan mana gaya he jisaki prayek bhujaa kii lambaai ek ho
 Thus it is clear that the unit of area and the unit of volume arise from the unit of length
 gati kii ikai paribhaasha ke anusaar, duuri ko samay se bhaag dene se praapt hoti he or chunki duuri lambaai main vyakt kii jaati he, isaliye gati kii ikai mul ikaayiyon par aadhrut he vyutpann ikaayiyon kaa mul ikaayiyon se ek saadhaaran sambandh bhi paaya gaya he
 It is often found that derived units are either very large or very small
 is avasthaa main suvidha ke drushtikon se inke kuch guneet, yaa upgunit, upyog main laae jate hai
 These new units are called practical units
 vaigyanik jagat main maap ke kaaryon ke liye aap taur par do prakaar kii ikaayiyon kii paddati upyog main laai jaati he : It is also called the 'foot Pound Second Method'
 is paddati main lambaai ko foot main, bhaar ko pound main tathaa samay ko second main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 This system is especially prevalent in those countries which were once part of the British Empire
 ise vishesh rup se british ejeeniyar, yaa britain main prashikshit ejeeniyar, tathaa ritu-vigyaan-visheshgy upyog main laate hai; lekin iskaa sthaan metry pranali leti ja rahi he
 It is also called metered method, or 'centimeter gram second method'
 is paddati ko sansar bhar main vaigyanik kaaryon main upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 In this, the length is measured in centimeters, weight in grams and time in one second
 metry paddati hi parivartit parivardhit karke meter-kilogram-second paddati bani jo punah parivardhit hokar antararashtriya ikai pranali bani
 The standard unit of length in a metered system is called a meter
 prarambh main janatantreey french kanoon ke anusaar ise uttari dhruv se vishuvat rekha tak paris se guzarati hui yamyottar kii sidh main maapi gai duuri ke 1 / 107 wein hissen ke baraabar mana gaya tha
 But the standard that has been accepted nowadays is the distance between the two markings at the ends of a pole of platinum-iridium alloy placed in Sever near Paris, when the pole is at zero degree centigrade
 ise maanak meter kaha jaataa he
 It is known from this table that 1 millimeter = 0
1 centimeter = 0
01 decimeter = 0
001 meter
 atev metry pranali main ikaayiyon ko keval dashamalav ke sthanantaran karne se hi badla ja saktaa he, jo atyant suvidhajanak he
 Thus it is clear that the metering system is a very convenient method
 khagol vigyaan main ko duuri maapne ke upyog main aanevaali ikai ko prakashavarsh kii sangya di gai he
 The distance that light travels in a year is considered to be a unit of distance for convenience in astronomy
 at: 1 prakashavarsh = 9
45 x 1015 meter
 In the British system, ie the foot-pound-second method, the standard unit of length is the British state yard
 yah landan ke rajkosh karyaalay main rakhe 62 degree fahrenheit taap par kaansya ke danda par sthit swarna-daaton par bani hui rekhaon ke bich kii duuri he
 Comparison of all measurements of length makes it clear that metric system is the most convenient and scientific among all methods
 bharat sarkaar ne isi baat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, saare desh main metry pranali ke upyog ke liye kanoon bana diya he
 The length units in both methods have these relationships: lambaai ko maapne ke liye lakdi yaa dhaatu kii bani hui, paimaanon vaali patariyaan, yaa anya vastu ke bane feete, kaam main laae jate hai
 Their edges are either carved in centimeters and millimeters, or in inches and tenths, eighths or sixteenths of it
 lambii duriyon ko, yaa vakr rekhaon main lambii duriyon kaa, maapne ke liye maapak chen, visheshkar jameen ke surveykshan main, upyog main laai jaati he
 When scales cannot be conveniently placed along the length, the compass, the penalty type, or a simple caliper are used

 Scrugges are used to measure very small lengths, such as the thickness of a sheet or the diameter of a thin wire, etc
 kshetrafal kii ikai meter paddati main varg centimetre tathaa british paddati main varg foot he
 The unit of volume is the volume of one cubic kilogram of pure water in the metered system, called the unit of volume in the metered system, ie, the liter
 saadhaarant: ek ghan desimetre ko litre ke samatuly mana gaya he
 The unit of volume is called Ghanfoot in the British system
 is paddati main dharita kii maanak maap ko galen kaha jaataa he
 10 pounds of distilled water at 62 ° f is assumed to be equal to 1 gallon
 yah paaya gaya he ki 1 galen = 4
54 litre hota he
 The metera unit of the capacity is considered a liter
 13ghan inch ke sambandh main yah paaya gaya he ki 4 degree sein0 par hawa se rahit ek ghan inch shuddh pani kaa bhaar 252
297 grain hota he
 In the metric system, the unit of mass is called a gram and the weight of one gram is equal to the weight of one cubic centimeter of pure water of 4 ° c temperature
 british pranali main dravyaman kii ikai ko pound kehete hai
 It is the weight of a platinum cylinder, which is kept in the state office of London
 dravyaman kii ikaayiyon kaa donon paddatiyon main ek sambandh paaya gaya he jo is prakaar he: We see the sun going across the sky
 akaash main surya kaa sarvocch sthaan yaa ucchtam unnataansh tab hota he jab vah yamyottar par hota he
 The interval of the sun going twice from the meridian is called darshan sun day

 yadi ham varsh ke sabhi dinon ke kaal ke jod den or ise varsh ke puure dinon se bhaag den, to ham ek samyantaral praapt karte hai, jise vegyanikon ne "madhya surya din" kii sangya di he
 This time is divided into twenty four hours
 prayek ghante ko saath minute main tathaa prayek minute ko saath second main baanta gaya he
 The unit of time is considered to be the second in both metered and British methods, which is 1 / 86,400th part of the mean sun day
 kisi sthaan ke shirobindu ke paar kisi sthir taare ke kramik gamanon main jo samyantaral vyateet hota he, vah taare ke kramik yamyottargaman ke bich kaa kaal, yaa nakshatra din kehalaata he
 Its value has been found to be constant
 nakshatra diwas madhya surya din se lagbhag chaar minute kam hota he
 The oscillator is used to find out whether the two time intervals are equal, or to divide the standard time into equivalent time intervals
 do samyantaral tabhi baraabar kahe jate hai jab prayek main dolak kii dolan sankhya ek hi hoti he
 If the number of oscillations of the oscillator is 60x60x24 in a "mean solar day", the time interval of each oscillation is called one second

 There is a need to re-assess the education of library science being provided by various universities in a changed environment on the basis of research so that the manpower working in the field of library and information can be fully enabled and they can efficiently and efficiently To perform tasks
 Library science should be active in the same direction as is required in today's context
 prayek pustkaalay main aisa praveshdwar hona aavashyak he jisase aane janewaalon par kadaa niyantran sambhav ho sake
 The library should have a good arrangement of light as well as pure air
 ek bhaag main sanchay kaksh ho or niyamit pathakon, anusandhankartaaon ke liye adhyayan kaksh hona chahie
 Special type of furniture is used in the library, such as list card cabinets, counters, different types of racks for leaflets, reading tables, chairs, cabinets and reading room chairs etc
 prayek pustkaalay main kuch upkarnon or steshnari aavashyak hoti he, jaise- suzaavapatr jisapar log kisi pustak ke kharidne kii sifarish karte hai, pustak-chunaav-patrak se pustakon kii kharid main aasaani rahati he, pustkadeshpatr ke dwaara pustaken pustkaalay main kharidi jaati hai
 The method of selecting the books of each library is designed according to its approach
 kisi kisi pustkaalay main pustak-chunaav-samiti hoti he jo samay-samay par pustaken kharidne kii sifarish karti rahati he
 The selection of books in public libraries is done to suit the interest of the readers
 iske pashchaat pustaken pustakavikritaon se mangaai jaati hai
 After their proper examination, the books are entered in the register and the books are sealed, labels, dates, book pockets etc
 pustakon ko thik se rakhane ke liye jisase vaanchhit pustak aasaani se praapt ho jaay, pustakon par vargeekaran najar daale jate hai
 Presently Decimal Classification System, Duplex Classification System, Extensible Classification System, Library of Congress Classification, Methodology, Subject Classification System and Secondary Classification Methods are prevalent in the world
 sansar ke anek pustakaalayon main dashamalav vargeekaran paddati hi praaia: prachlit he

too much and i don't tell you that i have excavated treasures and neither am i a gab and i say that i am an angel And i do not say to those who are guilty in your eyes that God will not do well with them, i know very well about the hearts of those people and if i say this then i too No one is guilty, those people started saying, "noah, you have feuds and many more quarrels with us, then you are true, then you used to threaten us, but you have to give me noah
 Can't beat him like that and if i want, then i will take care of you
 If God accepts you to be misguided, then nothing can work for me
 Gar and by the Koran that same side you go back to say You have said that if i have fabricated it, then i will bear the burden of my crime and i am the only one who is guilty and i have been sent to Noah that he has been given the faith Now if no one will believe in your religion, then you do not take the pleasure of their dignity and make a cauldron by our rubbish and our orders and about those who have persecuted
 Do not recommend me because these people will surely be drowned and Noah started to make a shirt and whenever the people of his community passed by him, Noah used to be prancing about them, saying that if you are a prankster at this time, the way you Laugh at us, we will laugh at you one time and you will get to know very quickly which one is destined to make him feel angry and one is a dummy azazi nazi It happens even when our order came and started cheering from Tannur We ordered two of every kind of life, take two and take all the people and people who have come to faith and sit in the cauldron in addition to the reality that has already been ordered and few people have faith in them
 And Noah said Bismillah Mazariha Mursaha get on board in Ksheti
 Blessing my family is a big calf and i think that those people were taken in the waves of the mountains
 Is going on and Noah gave voice to his son who was in a cot when he was separated from me, take my gazelle in our shoes and i am not with the infidels, so i still hold the support of a mountain that will save me from water
 Noah said that today there is no one to save himself from the wonders of God, but God is the one who will be rewarded, and suddenly there was a pleasure between the two sons and he was drowned and ordered that the land be Receiving water to absorbing and AI was overcast cease and declining water and work has been all And the woman who went to the same place and was told that the oppressed people were in the distance and was going on, then Noah called his family and my God is not in it because my son is involved in my environment and you promised
 Was that i will save your ehl) and it is not that your promise is true and that you are a greater prince than all the rulers, God has given you, Noah, he certainly does not join you
 No, it is a cruel illusion Noah has demanded that i take refuge from you in my family to request something that i do not know, and if you are ordered by me, Noah is safe from our side and i am in love with them
 Get down from those who are on you and those who are with you, not some of them and some people who we will deaf after a few days, then from our side they will get painful relief
 Huँchega These Chand Khbre of Ghab cause through the same style on your side You are not aware of what he has, nor do you have patience, it is not that the last is for the abstinence and the common man has his brother Hood told him from his community that my work is good for him
 Except you are not your lover, you are just a little iftera, my people do not understand that, and my people ask for blessings from your family and then pray for her If you stop yourself, then it will rain down on you from the sky, the happy sister will not do it and will not increase your poetry even more, and do not turn her face to face as a criminal, people say that you have not come to us with any argument and your By saying this, you are not going to leave your Gods, nor are we going to believe you, we just say that who among our Gods has made you a fool Hki do things Hud Beshk replied i am witness to God and you also witness Be that you make a love of God except God, in this i am a bishop, so all of you crave with me and do not give me any time, i do not care if i only trust God who is my God and my God And all the people who are walking on the ground are on top of it, it is not only that my family is on the straight path but also if you stay away from its command
 i have assured you that i was sent to you by order, and my family will kill you other than you, and you cannot spoil anything in it, it is not that my family is able to observe everything and When our order arrived, we gave Hood and those who had brought with him his kindness and saved us from our strict surprise
 We belong to the man who refused the verses of his family and his Disobey the prophets and keep following the orders of every government and even in this world, curse was put behind them and even on the Day of Judgment, the people refused their family
 See, the people of Hood are lying and the community has He said to his brother-in-law Saleh, "oh my country, i pray you only God, no one is your lover except him
 He created you from the ground and settled you in it Do not ask for blessings from him and then pray for him in the desert and listen to everyone and pray that he says, “saleh, before that we had our hopes before you, so now what did you expect our father grandfather to do?” We stop you from that and we are lying in such a way that you have surprised us, Saleh replied, Aye my law Well, if i am on the plea of my family and she has given me If i disobey myself, but if i disobey him, then who will help me - then you will not increase anything except for the loss, my demon is a camel of God, there is a chance for you, then leave it to God Eat in the ground and do not hurt him, then you will be taken aback immediately, but those people cut off his brush, then Saleh said, well, for three days, their own d i have the promise of peace that is never false, then when our command came, we saved Saleh and the people who had faith in him from his kindness and saved us from the day's weather, not that it is your family
 It is very ghalib and the people who had been tortured were taken away by a strict Chighad, then they got stuck in their houses and died so that Goya never settled in them
 Mr
 Keep listening not look Khume Thamud the Nafrmani their Lord and were The community has been abused and brought the good news to Ibrahim sent to us and he saluted and replied to the salute
 Then Ibrahim brought a calf to roast
 When he saw that his hands did not move towards him, he was disoriented and He was afraid and said, "you are not scared, we have been sent to the Lot of Lot, and Abraham's wife stood up, she was laughing, so we gave the good news of the birth of Isaac
" After Mr
 and Isaac, she started saying that now i am going to be a child, i am old and my parents are old too
 It is a wonderful thing that the angel said that you wonder about the nature of God
 Bet on you, God bless you and it is not worth it that he is an able-bodied old man
 When the fear of Ibrahim continued and the good news came to him, then we were told by Lot
 Desperate Ibrahim Burdbar was a soft-hearted person who started fighting in Ray Do not shy away from the fact that the order of your family has come and it is not sure that they are going to get such a surprise which cannot be avoided in any way and when our sent angels come to Lot, they are ready to think He became upset with his arrival and started saying that this is a day of severe trouble and his people came running to him and these people used to do bad things for him
 Lot saw him coming and said o my daughters, the daughters of these marriages marry them, they are justified and more clean for you, so do not be afraid of God and do not make me feel good about my guest, are any of you not a wise man? i know very well that we do not have any help with your girls and you know very well what we want, Lot said, i wish i had a fight against you Oti or i could take refuge in a fortified castle, he said Frishte a Lot We These people sent to you by your lover, the promise is just in the morning, is it not so early in the morning, when our command came, we reversed and made the top part of it down and on it we broke the corrugated stones, on which your family was He was a resident of the city and that settlement was not far from the oppressors and we sent his brother Uyab as a prophet to the Madayans
 o Lord, worship me, God is not God except you, and do not make any difference in size and weight, i am looking at you happily and i scare you with the wonder of the day that will surround and Keep my mass and scales full with justice and do not give the people their things and do not spread the ruins in the ground
 If you are a real mom, then the God of your habit Te said good and i do not have Nigehban He said people Ai Yuab Does your namaz teach you that we should leave those whose parents our grandfathers used to do or we can do whatever we want in our goods, you are just a savage and intelligent
 i am on the plea from the side and he has given me a livelihood and i do not want to stop you from doing whatever you want to do against me
 i do not want to become anyone except for you and i cannot believe anyone except myself, i have believed in it and i look forward to it and i do not commit such a crime against you Give the same trouble as Noah or Hood or Saleh were to you, and the same trouble will come upon you, and Lot's work is not far from you and you will ask for blessings from your family
 Don't forget me, my lover is very kind of love and those people Saying Aube, what you say is often not understood by us and it is not that we consider you very weak among our people and if you did not have a tribe, we would have communicated to you and you So we can not be wrong in any way
 Ayub said, my community, is the pressure of my clan greater than you and you have put yourself behind for yourself? The teacher is my family in the courtyard of your house and you do my work in my place, i also do something, you will soon know that the one who is in danger is going to make you angry and who is a liar, you should also be a monkey
 i am also waiting with you and when our order came, we saved Uyib and the people who brought him with his kindness and those who did not Victimization did they put replaced by a scream, then all that all their homes He was left stunned that Goya had never settled in those settlements
 Hear that the same way Madhun was also smitten and unhappy, we sent Moses to Pharaoh and his friend by pleading his blessings and rage
 He obeyed the decree again, although the decree of the revival was not thought out, he would go ahead of his demise on the Day of Judgment and take them to hell and throw them How many people were removed, and the shame was also put behind them and what a bad reward they got even on the Day of Judgment
 These are the conditions of the few settlements that we tell you, the hawk is the one and the hawk Was destroyed and we did not persecute them in any way, but those people persecuted themselves then when the order of your family came, it could not be used They used to call themselves except God, and those Mabuds did nothing but chant Not only did they benefit, but due to their ambition, the wonder came and with the help of the people of the settlements, when your family catches hold in the sky, then its grip is like this, the grip is so painful, it is not that for the person who has the surprise
 i am afraid that there is a sign that this will be the day that all the people will be deposited and this will be the day that all will be present and we are just a Muayyun issue We are delaying it till the day he arrives, then no one can talk to anyone without a command, then some people will be angry with them and some people will be angry and those who are upset will be shocked and Those who cry and scream will always be there as long as they are in the sky and on the ground, but when your family wants, no matter what your family wants, you will do whatever you want
 People are good, they will be in good condition as long as there is sky and land, they are always there
 But when your family wants it, it will be a fortune that will never be desired, then these people do not fall in love with whom you pray
 The portion will be reduced without any reason, and if we have given the book to Moses, then quarrels were put in it and if there was not already any order from your family, it would be in their favor
 The decision would have been assured and these people too are deeply involved in this behalf and it is not only that your family will give a lot of revenge to their people, who are very aware of their misdeeds, as they have commanded you
 You and the people who have been with you, justify your steps and do not do anything, whatever you do is definitely watching and the people who have They have persecuted above, do not have Mael on their side and otherwise even the fire will come to you and Apart from God and people are not even your guardians, then no one will help you and recite the Namaz on both sides of the day and some nights
 The truth is that sins are removed and for those who remember this, they are the advice and dignity and you Be patient because God does not destroy the souls of those who do good things, then why did some people who have passed before you not have such wisdom who have fallen on the ground Prevented the spread of de but very few and they were from the same people whom we rescued from the wonders and those who disobeyed after them and who were given to them and these people were criminals and your family is so Never was it that the settlements would be forcibly destroyed and the people there are noble practices, and if your family wanted it, it would have made all the people unhappy, they did not want this same people
 Esha put forth to one another will, but the mercy of your Lord to Frmaa and so He created those people
 The order of your family is very fulfilled that we will surely fill the soul with all the jinn and men, and in the condition of the prophets, we tell you all those things that we can strengthen your heart
 Will give and in those cases you have also received the advice and remembrance for the right and the promise and tell those who do not believe that you will eat instead Implement, we also do something, you also wait, we are anxious and all the sky and the rich things of the land are special, and every work towards it comes back again and again you pray the same and trust in it And what you guys do is not completely oblivious, but the hood is over We make statements by which we will strengthen your heart and in those cases, you have also received a lot of advice and remembrance for your rights and responsibilities and tell those who do not believe that you do something yourself, we also do something for you

 Brahmasutra is one of the six Darshans of Hindus
 iske rachayita baadaraayan hai
 It is also known as Vedanta Sutra, uttar-mimamsa Sutra, Body Sutra and Monk Sutra etc
 is par anek bhashya bhi likhe gayi hai
 The three main pillars of Vedanta are considered - Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita and Brahmasutra
 in teenon ko prasthaan trayee kaha jaataa he
 In this, the Upanishads are known as Shruti departure, Gita as memory departure and Brahmasutras as justice departure
 brahm sutron ko nyaay prasthaan kehane kaa arth he ki ye veydant ko purnatah tarkpurna dhang se prastut karata he
 According to ancient tradition, the author of Vedantasutra is considered as Badarayan
 par in sutron main hi baadaraayan kaa namollekh karke unke mat kaa uddhran diya gaya he at: kuch log ise baadaraayan kii kriti na maanakar kisi parvarti sangraahak kii kriti kehete hai
 Badarayana and Vyasa are sometimes considered one
 jaimini ne apane purvamimasaasutra main baadaraayan kaa tathaa baadaraayan ne vedantasutron main jaimini kaa ullekh kiya he
 If Badarayana and Vyasa are the same, then according to the tradition of Mahabharata, Jaimini was a disciple of Vyasa
 or guru apni kriti main shishy ke mat kaa ullekh kare, yah vicitra sa lagata he
 In these sutras, there are further indications of Sankhya, Vaishika, Jain and Buddhist beliefs
 gita kii ore bhi ishaara kiya gaya he
 Many such Acharyas and their views are mentioned in these sutras which are also mentioned in the Srauta Sutras
 garudpurana, padmapurana or manusmriti vedant sutron kii charchaa karte hai
 According to Hapkins, the composition of Harivamsa is the second century BCE and it clearly mentions Vedantasutra

 The Jacobi consider it to be between 200 and 450 AD

 The principles propounded in the Upanishads are so conflicting and scattered that it is difficult to draw a philosophical view of a type from them
 vedant sutara 'samanvay' ke siddhant kaa sahaara lekar upanishdon main ek darshanik drushti kaa pratipaadan karata he
 But these formulas themselves are so brief that it is difficult to extract meaning from them without interpretation
 inaki sankshiptata ke kaaran inpar kai vyakhyaayein likhi gai jo paraspar virdohi drushti se vedant kaa pratipaadan karti he
 All the departures of Vedanta consider these sutras as their proof
 brahm kaa pratipaadan karne ke kaaran in sutron ko brahmasutra bhi kehete hai
 There are four chapters in the Brahmasutra, namely, coordination, opposition, means and fruits
 prayek adhyay ke chaar paad hai
 Altogether it has 555 sutras
 adhyas naam sutara sankhya adhikaran sankhyasamanvayadhiyaay :- 134 ;- 39avirodh :- 157 ;- 47saadhan :- 186 ;- 67fal

 The oldest among them is Shankar Bhashya
 shankaracharya ke bhashya par vachaspati mishra tathaa padmapad ne bhashya likhaa
 The name of Brahmasutra written by Ramanujacharya is 'sribhasya'
 iske atirikt madhwacharya, jayatirth, vyasatirth, bhaskar, nimbark aadi ne bhi brahmasutra ke bhashya likhe hai

 gurutvkarshan taron ko ek saath band kar rakhata he or isi tarah anek gallexi ek saath milakar tara gucchh main rahati he

 Astronomers mainly divide galaxies into three parts based on their size
 yah koi nahin jaanata ki kyon gallexiyaan ek nishchit rup dhaaran karti he
 Perhaps it depends on the velocity of rotation of galaxies and the speed of the stars in it
 hamaari gallexi kii chaudaai or chamak sarvatrasman nahin he
 It is the widest and brightest in the Dhanu planetarium
 doordarshee se dekhne par gallexi main asankhya taare dikhaai padate hai
 By counting the number of stars of different brightness, calculating their distance and measuring their speed, astrologers have made a very good estimate of the true form of the galaxy
 yadi akaash main dikhaai padanevaale rup ke badale trivitiya avkaash main gallexi ke rup par vichaar kiya jaae to pataa chalata he ki gallexi lagbhag samtal vrittakar pahie ke samaan he jisaki dhuree ke paas kaa bhaag kuch phula hua he

 The density of dust and gas is high in the center of the body

 Somewhere clouds of gas appear as glowing nebulae, stirred by the light of nearby stars

 But after his death, Ganga Deva defeated the Chandels and cleared the way for his suzerainty over Madhya Pradesh

 In his ignorance, Gangeya Dev assumed the burden of protecting Hindu culture and Hindu pilgrimages

 Apart from a specific study of rural community and caste structure, M

 Srinivas has also done thought provoking work on topics such as social impact of science, Gandhi's religious thinking, history of anthropology and gender
 shrinivas kaa krititv vastunishth paryvekshan, vishleshan kii maheentaon tathaa saidhantik gaharaai kaa durlabh sangam mana jaataa he
 His writing provides a particular ground context for inter-subjectivity
 shrinivas kii samajashastreey drushti ghatnaon kii bahari banaavat ko bhed kar unhen gadhane vaali sanrachanaon or aitihaasik shaktiyon kii thaah leti he
 His ability to present the nuanced details and insights of community life in simple language gives him a distinct personality from contemporary sociologists
 is arth main ve vishaygat shabdaawalee kaa atikaraman karte hue saadhaaran or prachlit bhashaa ko chunate hai
 It will be called the democracies of his scholarship that his theoretical concepts help in understanding the subject rather than engaging in his own ideas
 shrinivas ne vicharadhara ke str par bhartiya samajashaastra ke liye ek nayi zamin taiyaar kii
 It is worth mentioning that at the time when Srinivas was preparing to study Indian society, American and British academic installations dominated social sciences
 america vishvavidhyalayon main prachlit drushtikon bhartiya upmahadweep ke samaaj ko samajhane ke liye sanskritnishtha paramparaon par jor detaa tha
 As a result, Indian sociologists considered Sanskrit sources and Indology / Indology to be more authentic for the study of contemporary reality
 shrinivas pehle samajashastri the jinhone is varchasvkaari sthiti ko chunauti di
 He proved from his writings that in sociology, the study of the actual activities and activities of society is better than relying on classical references
 shrinivas dwaara prastut prabhutvshaalee jati tathaa samskruthikaran kii avadharanaon kaa raajnneeti vigyaniyon ke alaava itihaas-lekhan kii sabaltern jaisi dhaaraon ke itihaaskaaron ne vyapak prayog kiya gaya he
 In this sense, his work can be placed in the category of an intellectual tradition which has acquired the status of an important reference for new and old scholars
 prasangvash, prabhutvshaalee jati kii avadharana sankhya bal, bhu-swaamitv, shiksha or naukari jaise karkon ke kaaran kisi jati ke gaanv yaa kshetra vishesh main dabadabe ko jaahir karti he to samskruthikaran nimna jatiyon dwaara ucch jatiyon khaas taur par brahman varg kii samskruti, reeti-rivaazon, bhashaa or veshbhusha aadi ko apnaane kii pravriti ko gyaapit karti he
 Though his third concept vote bank could not make a permanent place in social sciences, the term is used indiscriminately in the daily discourse of politics and media world
 swatantra bharat kii raajnneetik or saamaajik sanrachana ke adhyayan main ye teenon avadharanaayen or usase jude vimarsh tattvik mahatva hasil kar chuke hai
 The concepts of dominant caste and culturalization help in understanding the decisive elements of India's social system and its organizational structure
 haalaanki brahmnavaadi aadarshon kii ghatati vaidhata ke kaaran samskruthikaran kii avadharana ab utani mahatvapurn nahin maani jaati lekin yah tathy he ki beesvin sadi ke ek bade kalkhand or swatantraaa ke baad bhi lambe samay tak samskruthikaran ek kaasi ullekhneey pravriti thi
 In the politics that emerged after the Dalit movement and the Mandal Commission, the trend of Sanskritisation has weakened, but the concept of dominant caste is still seen as an essential tool in analyzing the political processes in rural society in India
 kai samakaleen samajashastri shrinivas ke krititv ko rashtravaadi samajashaastra ke brihattar sandarbh main rakhkar aankane kaa aagrah karte rahe hai
 He says that the urban elite of independent India wanted to continue the project of modernization of colonial rule
 isliye rashtravaadi samajashastriyon ke krititv main chintan or vichaar kii vahi aupniveshik saraniyan sakriy thi jinke aadhaar par british satta apane shashan ko vaid tehraati aayi thi
 These scholars say that the work of sociologists like Srinivas focused on caste and community provides a benchmark for understanding of an all-india Sanskritist Hinduism
 lekin shrinivas kii drushti ko prakat yaa aprakat taur par british yaa america maanavshaastra kii sthapanaaon se nirdeshit bataanaa jaldbaaji kii daleel he jo subooton kii kami ke baavjood aarope patr taiyaar karne kii himakat karti he
 This argument fails to target the tendency of Srinivasa's work in which Srinivas studies the community and also considers the duality of the community and its relations
 shrinivas samajashaastra or maanavshaastra kii buniyadi prasthaapanaaon par bhi thik isi tarah vichaar karte hai
 It is worth noting that Srinivas defines himself as a fellow scholar, as a fellow scholar, whose identity is not different from his subject ie people
 shrinivas jin logon yaa samudaay kaa adhyayan karte the unhen ve anya kii shrenee main nahin rakhte the
 In this regard, many British anthropologists have believed that anthropologists studying their society face different kinds of difficulties
 unke anusaar viksit desh kaa maanavshastri ek deshaj maanavshastri ko uski nimnatar sthiti kii ore ishaara karke hameshaa ek khaas saanche main kaid rakhana chahta he
 Srinivas, while clarifying the position of the indigenous anthropologist on this issue, wrote that when an Indian anthropologist studies any caste or other group of India, that caste or group is other for him but at the same time does not ignore this
 It should be done that certain cultural forms, beliefs and values of that caste or group also match the said scholar
 yani aisi sthiti main bhartiya maanavshastri asal main ek tarah se anya main swa kaa bhi adhyayan karata he
 In this sense, that caste or group is not completely unfamiliar to him or her as both are connected to the same culture
 shrinivas is sthiti ko asaamaanya dhang se jatil, bahuparti or dwaidhapurna maanate hai
 Looking carefully, Srinivas does not seem to be accused of being a nationalist sociologist given the points of difference and equality with his subject
 vastav main shrinivas is baat par jor dete hai ki adhyayan main aatm or anya kii yah bahulata maanavshastri ke apane samudaay kaa sadsy hone yaa bahari hone kii ekalata se kahin zyaada shreyaskar he
 It is noteworthy that he uses many observations from the Chicago School to study the caste system of the village of Rampura, which was chosen by Srinivas for his research studies
 varna kii prak-british avadharana ko shrinivas kitaabi nazariyaa siddh karte hue yah kehete hai ki yah drushti jati ke gatisheel pakshon ko gaun kar detii he
 Although Srinivas's caste-study focused on the local structure of a village, he was also conscious of the pan-india prevalence of this phenomenon
 apane ek lekh main ve is tathy kii ore ishaara karte hai ki jati nihsandeh ek akhil bhartiya sanrachana he, kyonki desh main har jagah aise samooh dekhe ja sakate hai jo paitrukataa tathaa vaivaahik sambandhon ke aadhaar par ek vishisht samooh kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Srinivas also cites traditional employment of these groups in this regard
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki desh main har jagah brahman, achhut, kisaan, dastkaar, vyapaaree or dusron kii seva karne vaali jatiyon kaa astitv dekha ja saktaa he
 In this caste study, Srinivas also mentions regional variations and factors such as western education, administrative jobs, city income, which have had a major impact on the caste structure
 is tarah deergh avadhi ke lihaaj se dekhen to ek samajashastri ke taur par shrinivas ne bhartiya gram or jati kii sanrachana ko aupniveshik dharanaon ke saidhantik varchasv se bhi mukt karaayaa he
 At the same time, he also countered the beliefs of sociologists like Dumon who were proposing that caste differences do not allow the Indian village to become a community
 shrinivas jab gramin samudaay kii sankalpana or gaanvon kii aarthik-saanskrithik antar-nirbharta kii baat karte hai to ve avyakt dhang se akhil bhartiya sabhyataa kii baat bhi karte hai
 Some scholars believe that Srinivas has adopted a Brahminical or upper caste point of view in the study of caste
 lekin is daleel ko sahi kone se dekhen to vah darasal aupniveshik samajashaastra se nikali prathit hoti he
 Srinivas's logic-plan actually exposes the macro and under-concerned perceptions of Western sociologists regarding India's rural communities
 sankshep main kaha jaae to shrinivas kaa krititv pashchimi gyanshastreey prasthaapanaaon, swa, samudaay tathaa raashtra kii dharanaon ke aalochakeey vimarsh main kai buniyadi tark muhaiyaa karaata he

 Later, the mission was split into two

 Hans Ji Maharaj taught the mysterious technique of meditation under the name Gyan
 In 1960, he established the Divine Light Mission in India

 iktisvin putali jiskaa naam kaushalya tha, ne apni katha is prakaar kahi- raja vikramaditya vruddh ho gaye the tathaa apane yogabal se unhone yah bhi jaan liya ki unka ant ab kaaphi nikat he
 He used to engage himself in both royal work and religious work
 unhone van main bhi sadhana ke liye ek awaas bana rakhaa tha
 One night, in the same residence, one night, he saw supernatural light coming from far away
 unhone gaur se dekha to pataa chalaa ki sara prakaash saamne vaali pahadiyon se aa rahaa he
 Amidst this light, he saw a beautiful beautiful building glowing
 unke man main bhawan dekhne kii jigyaasa hui or unhone kaali dwaara pradutt donon betaalon kaa samaran kiya
 At their command, Betal brought them to the hill and told them that they could not go beyond it
 kaaran poochne par unhone bataaya ki us bhawan ke chaaron ore ek yogi ne tantra kaa gheraa daal rakhaa he tathaa us bhawan main uskaa nivas he
 Only those whose virtue is greater than that yogi can enter inside those circles
 vikram ne sach jaanakar bhawan kii ore kadam badha diya
 They wanted to see if his virtue was more than that yogi
 chalate-chalate ve bhawan ke pravesh dwaar tak aa gaye
 Suddenly a fire body came from somewhere and settled near them
 usee samay bheetar se kisi kaa aagyaabhra swar sunai padaa
 He went behind the fire pit and the entrance was cleared
 vikram andar ghuse to vahi awaz unase unka parichay poochne lagi
 He said that everything should be told clearly or else he will curse the coming curse
 vikram tab tak kaksh main pahunch chuke the or unhone dekha ki yogi uth khadaa hua
 When he told her that he was Vikramaditya, Yogi called himself lucky
 usne kaha ki vikramaditya ke darshan honge yah aashaa use nahin thi
 The Yogi gave him a lot of respect and asked Vikram to ask for something
 raja vikramaditya ne usase tamaam suvidhaon sahit vah bhawan maang liya
 After handing that building to Vikram, Yogi went somewhere in the same forest
 chalate-chalate vah kaaphi dur pahunchaa to uski bhent apane guru se hui
 When his mentor wanted to know the reason for wandering in this way, he said that he has donated the building to King Vikramaditya
 uske guru ko hansee aa gai
 He said that what would he donate to the best donor of this earth and he asked him to go to Vikramaditya and ask for his building in Brahmin form again
 vah vesh badalakar us kutiyaa main vikram se mila jisamen ve sadhana karte the
 He requested for an accommodation
 vikram ne usase apni icchit jagah maangane ko kaha to usne vah bhawan maanga
 Vikram smiled and said that he left the building as soon as he came at the same time
 unhone bas uski pariksha lene ke liye usase vah bhawan liya tha
 After this tale, the thirty-first pupil did not finish its story
 vah boli- raja vikramaditya bhale hi devataaon se badhkar gun vaale the or indrasana ke adhikari maane jate the, ve the to maanav hi
 He was born in the dead land, so one day he gave up Ihilila

 He was anointed with fanfare
 magar vah unke singhaasana par nahin baith sakaa
 He does not know why he cannot sit on the throne of the father
 vah uljhan main padaa tha ki ek din swapn main vikram khud aae
 He asked the son to first attain divinity to sit on that throne
 unhone use kaha ki jis din vah apane punya-pratap tathaa yash se us singhaasana par baithne laayak hoga to ve khud use swapn main aakar bataa denge
 But if Vikram did not come in his dream, he did not know what to do to the throne
 panditon or vidwaanon ke paraamarsh par vah ek din pita kaa samaran karke soya to vikram sapane main aae
 In the dream, he asked him to get that throne buried in the ground and advised him to leave Ujjain and make his new capital at Ambavati
 unhone kaha ki jab bhi prithvi par sarvagun sampann koi raja kaalaantar main paidaa hoga, yah singhaasana khud-ba-khud uske adhikaar main chalaa jayega
 Following the father's dream order, he called the laborers in the morning and dug a very deep pit and suppressed the throne in it

 "' Similarly the Roman word salarium is associated with employment, salt and soldiers, but the exact relationship is not clear
 kam se kam saamaanya siddhant yah he ki swayan soljar shabd hi latin ke saal daire se niklaa he
 Alternatively, the Roman historian Pliny the Elder, in his Natural History discussion of seawater, stated indirectly, that "in Rome

 Regardless of the exact relationship, the salaries paid to Roman soldiers have since been defined as wages in lieu of work in Western countries and promoted those expressions as "paying one's salt

 Even in the years between 1520 and 1650, many salaries were initially paid by the Commercial Revolution during the industrialization and later in the 18th and 19th centuries, but to an extent they were paid as employees

 According to Islamic belief, Hazrat Ibrahim inscribed his son Hazrat Ismail on the same day, on the order of God that he was going to sacrifice in the way, then Allah gave life to his son, in whose memory this festival is celebrated

 It comes in the books that God sent his angels to sacrifice an animal in place of Ismail
 darasal ibrahim se jo asal qurbaani maangi gai thi vah thi unki khud kii thi arthath ye ki khud ko bhul jaao, matlab apane sukh-aaraam ko bhuulakar khud ko maanavtaa / insaaniyat kii seva main puri tarah se laga do
 Then he decided to settle his son Ismail and his mother Hajra in Mecca
 lekin makka us samay registan ke sivaa kuch na tha
 After settling them in Mecca, he himself left for human service
