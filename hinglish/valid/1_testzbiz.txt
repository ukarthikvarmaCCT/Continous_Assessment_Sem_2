 The English word 'emotion' has its origin from the French word émouvoir
 yah latin shabd emovere par aadhaarit he jahaan e- kaa arth he 'baahar' or movere kaa arth he 'chalanaa'
 sambandhit shabd "prerana" kii atpatti bhi movere se hui he
 No definitive classification of emotions exists, although several classifications have been proposed
 inamen se kuch vargeekaran hai: The related difference between emotion and the consequences of emotion is the main behavioral and emotional expression

 yadi koi bina koi sambandhit abhivyakti ke bhaavana prakat kare to ham maan sakate hai kii bhaawanaaon ke liye abhivyakti kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Neuroscientific research suggests that there is a "magic quarter second" during which the thought can be known before an emotional response is formed
 us pal main, vyakti bhaavana ko niyantrit kar saktaa he
 The James – Lang theory states that experiences of bodily changes result in large-scale emotion sensations
 bhaawanaaon ke prati kriyaatmak drushtikon, se pataa chalata he ki bhavanaaen kisi vishesh kriya ke falswaroop ek vishay ke rup main surakshit rakhane ke liye ubhari hai
 There are some basic and complex categories, where some basic emotions can be converted into somewhat complex emotions
 In a situation, complex emotions can arise due to cultural conditions or alliances associated with basic emotions
 vaikalpik rup se, mul rangon ke mishran ke anuroop,mul bhavanaaen maanav kii bhaawanaaon ke anubhav se mil kar bhaawanaaon kaa purna indradhanush bana sakati hai
 For example a mixture of mutual anger and hatred can lead to contempt
 robert plutchik ne ek triayami "sarkamplex model" prastaavit kiya he jo bhaawanaaon ke bich sambandhon ko darshata he
 This model is similar to a colored circle
 lambavat maap tivrata ko darshaate hai or sarkal bhaawanaaon ke bich samanta kii degree bataata he
 They arranged the eight primary emotions into pairs of four opposite emotions
 kuch log meta imoshans ke astitv ke bare main bhi tark dete hai jo bhaawanaaon ke bare main bhavanaaen hai
 Another meaning of specific emotions is related to their timing
 kuch bhavanaaen kuch second kii hoti hai, jabaki kuch kai saalon tak rah sakati hai 
 baad vaali ko ek lambi avadhi kii pravriti ke rup main mana ja saktaa he jisame ek uchit bhaavana kii bajaay keval kisi ke prati lagaav kii bhaavana he

 Temperament is also comparable on the basis of character traits in which one's disposition usually varies according to the experience of particular emotions for different objects

 Finally, some researchers classify emotions into a general category of 'affective state', where affect / aroused situations also include emotion-related events such as happiness and pain, emotional conditions, mood, mood, and symptoms

 saanchaa:emotion Theories related to emotions carry the ideas of ancient Greece to Plato and Aristotle
 hamen rene descartes, barook spinoja or david hum jaise darshanikon ke kaam ke rup main parishkrut siddhant bhi milte hai
 Later theories related to emotions have resulted from advances in research
 zyaadaatar siddhant alag nahin hai or kai shodhakartaaon ne apane kaam main vibhinn drushtikon shaamil kiye hai
 According to the somatic theory of emotions, the body reacts directly to emotions rather than to essential judgments
 is tarah ke siddhanton kaa pehla aadhunik sanskaran 1880 main wiliam james ne prastut kiya
 The theory lost support in the 20th century, but recently it has gained popularity again as a result of neurological evidence from researchers such as John Cachioppo, Antonio Damasio, Joseph E
 Leidu and Robert E
 Zajonc
 wiliam james ne ek lekh 'whot iz en imoshan?', ke dwaara yah tark diya ki zyaadaatar bhaavnaatmak anubhav shaareerik badlaavon ke kaaran hote hai
 Around this time Danish psychologist Karl Lang also introduced a similar theory, so it is known as the James – Lang theory
 is siddhant or iske tathyon ke anusaar, paristhiti ke badalane se shaareerik badlaav hota he
 As James puts it, "the concept of physical change is emotion"
 James claims that "we feel sad because we cry, angry during a fight, afraid to tremble, and it may happen that, in an apology, we do not cry during anger or fear
" Fight or shiver is siddhant ko prayogon dwaara sabit kiya gaya he, jisame sharir kii sthitiyon main badlaav laa kar vaanchit bhaavana praapt kii jaati he
 This type of experiment has also been used in medicine
 james-lang's theory is often misunderstood because it is contradictory
 zyaadaatar logon kaa maananaa he ki bhavanaaen, bhaavana sambandhit kriyaaon ko badhaava detii hai : jaise "main ro rahaa hoon kyonki main udhaas hoon", yaa "main bhaaga kyonki main dar gaya"
 iske vipareet, james-laing kaa siddhant jor detaa he ki ham pehle sthiti ke anusaar pratikriya karte hai or iske baad ham apni kriyaaon ko bhaavnaatmak pratikriya se jodate hai
 In this way, emotions explain and organize our own actions
 james-laing ke siddhant ko ab zyaadaatar chaatro dwaara nakaar diya gaya he
 According to the following statement by Tim Dalgleish: The james-lang theory has remained influential
 Its main contribution is the emphasis it places on the embodiment of emotions, especially the argument that changes in the bodily concomitants of emotions can alter their experienced intensity
 Most contemporary neuroscientists would endorse a modified james-lang view in which bodily feedback modulates the experience of emotion
" a problem with james-lang's theory is that it focuses on the consequences of action, not on the physical effects of emotional experiences
 
 mastishk sanrachana kii tantrikaon kii masping se mili jaankaree se, maanav bhaawanaaon kii neurobiological vyakhya yah he ki bhaavana ek priy yaa apriy sthiti he jostandhari ke mastishk main paidaa hoti he
 If it is compared to reptiles, the development of emotions will be similar to the transformation of normal bone animals into mammals, in which the neurochemical fluctuates according to the level of brain activity, which causes the body to move, mood swings
 And is reflected in the postures
 udhaaharan ke liye, pyaar kii bhaavana ko standhari ke mastishk ke peleocircuit kii abhivyakti mana jaataa he, jisase dekhbhaal, bhojan karaane or sondarya jaisi bhaawanaaon kaa bodh hota he
 Paleosurkits are a means of displaying bodily emotions by nerves that were formed millions of years before the cortical nerve was formed
 isamen pehle se bane hue raste yaa mastishk ke agle hisse, brain stem tathaa meru rajoumein tantrika koshikaon kaa jaal hota he
 They originated even before the ancestors of mammals to control actions, almost around the time of jawless fish
 mana jaataa he ki, standhari ke mastishk ke viksit hone se pehle, jaanwaron kii zindagi, swachaalit, sachet or nappi tuli thi
 The body of reptiles responds to sensory signals of vision, voice, touch, chemistry, gravity, with predetermined body movements and postures
 raat main sakriy hone vaale stanadhariyon ke aagaman ke saath, lagbhag 180 million varsh pehle, gandh ne ek prabhavi tantrika ke rup main drushti kaa sthaan le liya or soonghney vaali tantrika ke madhyam se pratikriya karne ke or raste bane, jo ki mana jaataa he ki aage chal kar stanadhariyon kii bhaawanaaon or bhaavnaatmak yaaddaasht ke rup main viksit hue
 jurassic kaal main, stanadhariyon ne sarisrupon kii tulana main apni soonghney kii kshamta kaa safaltaapurvak upyog kiya - isiilie stanadhariyon ke mastishk kighran tantrika kaa bhaag sarisrupon kii tulana main bada hota he
 These odors slowly became the blueprint of nerves, which later formed the structure of our brain
 mana jaataa he ki bhavanaaen mastishk ke us kshetra kii kaaryashiltaa se sambandhit he jo hamen nirdesh detaa he, hamaare vyavhaar ko prerit karata he or hamaare ird gird hone vaali ghatnaon ke mahatva kii vyakhya karata he
 Important discoveries by Broca, Papez, and mclean suggest that emotions are associated with a group of structures in the middle of the brain called the limbic system, including the hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, hippocampi, and other structures
 haal hi main hue anusandhanon se pataa chalaa he ki isamen se kuch limbik sanrachanaayen, dusron ke vipareet, bhaawanaaon se us tarah se sidhi nahin judi hai jabaki kuch gaiyr limbik sanrachanaayen adhik mahatv kii pai gayin hai
 There is substantial evidence that the left prefrontal cortex is activated by stimuli that are produced by positive thinking
 yadi aakarshak uttejnaa mastishk ke chuninda hisse ko sakriy kar paae to tark purna dhang se ulta hona chahie, arthath adhik sakaaratmak dhang se nirnay lene ke liye mastishk ke us hisse kii chuninda kriyasheeltaa ko uttejnaa utpann kerani chahie
 iskaa pradarshan madhyam aakarshan vaale uttejk drishyon ke saath kiya gaya tha or baad main iskaa vistaar karke nakaaratmak uttejnaa ko shaamil karke ise doharaaya gaya
 Neurobiological models in the prefrontal cortex revealed two opposite results of emotion
 The valence model predicted that anger, which is a negative emotion, would activate the right prefrontal cortex
 The Direction Model predicted that anger is an attitude sense, so will activate the left prefrontal
 The second model received support
 haalanki abhi bhi kai sawaal anuttarit hai ki prifrantal cortex main drushtikon kii behatar vipareet paribhaasha kya he, dur janaa, bina kisi pratikriya ke, kintu takat tathaa pratirodh yaa bina kisi pratikriya ke niskriy parinaam 
 sharmaane tathaa vyavhaar sambandhit baadhaon par hue shodhon se ection tendency model ko samarthan mila he 
 "homeostatic bhavanaaen" sharir kii aantarik avasthaa dwaara utpann zajbaat hai, jo hamaare vyavhaar ko vyavasthit karte hai
 Thirst, hunger, feeling hot or cold, feeling deprived of sleep, a desire to eat salt and a desire for air are all examples of homeostatic feelings; Each of these is a signal given by the physiological system that says "everything is not right
 piyo / khao / chaaya main jaao / kuch garam pahano / so jaao / namakeen tukdaa chato / saans lo
" isamen se kisi bhi pranali kaa santulan kharaab hone par, ham homeostatic bhaavana kaa anubhav karne lagate hai or yah bhaavana hamen vahi karaati he, jo us pranali kaa santulan banaae rakhane ke liye aavashyak he
 Pain is a homeostatic feeling that tells us “everything is not well
 peeche hato or bacho"
 There are some theories that argue that cognitive action - a judgment, evaluation, or thought - is necessary to produce an emotion
 richard loras ke anusaar yah is tathy ko pramanit karne ke liye aavashyak he ki bhaavana kisi chiz ke bare main yaa jaanboojh kar paidaa hoti he
 This type of cognitive activity can be conscious or subconscious and may or may not take the form of a conceptual process
 yahan loras kaa ek prabhaavshaalee siddhant he : bhaavana ek baadha he jo nimna kram main utpann hoti he : 1
) sangyanatmak moolyankan-vyakti us ghatana kaa tarkpurna akalan karata he jo bhaavana ko ingit karti he
 2
 Physiological changes - Cognitive responses result in biological changes, such as increased heartbeat or a response to pituitary adrenal
 3
 Action - The person experiences the emotion and chooses to react
 udhaaharan ke liye: jeni ek saanp dekhati he
 1
) Jenny sees the snake, which makes her scared
 2
) Her heart starts beating hard
 adrellin kaa rakt main pravaah tej ho jaataa he
 3
 Jenny yells and runs away
 loras jor dekar kehete hai ki bhaawanaaon kii gunvattta or tivrata ko sangyanatmak pratikriyaaon dwaara niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 These responses form a rescue strategy that forms an emotional response according to changes in the individual and his environment
 bhaawanaaon se sambandhit kuch siddhant ye tark dete hai ki bhaavana ke utpann hone ke liye nirnay, moolyankan yaa vichaaron ke rup main sangyanatmak kriya aavashyak he
 a prominent philosophical lecturer is Robert C
 Solomon
 a second example of this is a theory proposed by Niko Frijda according to which trends occur due to evaluation
 yah suzav bhi diya gaya he ki bhavanaaen aamtaur par soochna ko kriyanvit karne tathaa vyavhaar ko prabhavit karne ke liye shortkat kii tarah prayukt hoti hai
 a new hybrid theory of the somatic and cognitive theory of emotions is the perceptual theory
 yah siddhant is tark main alag he kii shaareerik pratikriyaayein, bhaawanaaon par kendrit hai, tathaapi ye bhaawanaaon kii sarthakata par jor detii he yaa is vichaar par, ki bhavanaaen kisi chiz ke bare main he jaisaa ki sangyanatmak siddhanton dwaara paaya gaya he
 The new claim of this theory is that imagined cognition is unnecessary for this type of meaning
 balki shaareerik parivartan khud ko paristhitiyon ke kisi karanvash kriya main badalane ke kaaran bhaawanaaon kii sarthak saamagree ke hisaab se dhaal lete hai
 In this regard, emotions correspond to the power of the mind, such as sight or touch, which in various ways gives us information about the relationship between the object and the world
 is drushtikon kaa ek parishkrut bachaav darshanik jesi prinz kii pustak gat riyekshanz or manovaigyanik james layerd kii pustak feelings main paaya gaya
 It is a communication theory developed by Howard M
 Wise and Russell Cropanzeno, which focuses on the causes, structures and consequences of emotional experiences
 yah siddhant bataata he ki bhavanaayen ghatnaon dwaara prabhavit or ghatit hoti hai jo parinamswaroop nazariye or vyavhaar ko prabhavit karte hai
 This theoretical framework also emphasizes the time in which a person perceives the experience and what is called an emotional episode - "a sequence of emotional conditions that increases over time and is organized around a core theme
 " is siddhant ko kai shodhakartaaon dwaara bhaavana ko sanchaar ke dwaara behatar dhang se samajhane ke liye prayukt kiya gaya he or is par howard em vaais tathaa danniel je bill dwaara apane lekhonriflaction on afective events theory main samiksha kii he jo 2005 main research on imoshan in orgenigeshns main prakashit hua
 In the Canon Bard theory, Walter Breadford argues in contrast to james-lang's effective theory on the physical facts of emotion in the Canon Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear, and Rage
 jahaan james kaa tark tha ki bhaavnaatmak vyavhaar aksar aage kii or badhata he yaa bhaavana kii vyakhya karata he, canan or board kaa tark tha ki pehle bhavanaaen utpann hoti hai or uske baad vishisht vyavhaar utpann hota he
 Another cognitive theory is the Singer – Shafter theory
 yah prayogon ke abhipraayon par aadhaarit he jo bataata he ki ek hi maansik avasthaa main hone ke baavjood adrenelin ke ek injaikashan dwaara vyaktiyon kii vibhinn bhaavnaatmak pratikriyaayein ho sakati hai
 Individuals were observed expressing anger or happiness in line with the sentiment expressed according to the situation of the other person
 is prakaar, sthiti ke moolyankan or pratibhaagi dwaara adrenelin yaa plasebo lene ke sangyojan ne ekasaath pratikriyaayein nirdhaarit kin
 is prayog kii jesi pinz kii gat riyekshanz main aalochana kii gai he
 a recent version of cognitive theory roughly describes emotions as being at the same time a number of different physiological and cognitive components
 bhavanaaen samgr prakriya dwaara pahachaani jaatin hai jisase kam str kaa sangyanatmak moolyankan, vishesh rup se praasangik prasanskaran main, shaareerik pratikriyaaon, vyavhaar, bhaawanaaon or kriyaaon ko shuru karata he

 --> Deep Throat is a pseudonym given to the informer who in 1972 gave information to The Washington Post's Bob Woodward about the administration of United States President Richard Nixon being involved in a scandal called the Watergate Scandal
 nicksan ke istife ke ektis saal baad yah khulaasa hua ki deep throt asal main fedral beuro of investigeshan ke purv associat diarector mark felt the
 Deep Throat was first introduced to the public in the 1974 book All the President's Men, written by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Karl Bernstein, transforming the book into an academy-award winning film two years later
 lekhakon ke anusaar, deep throt ek aise ghotaale par aalekhon kii ek shrinkhalaa ke liye soochna kaa ek mahatvapurn strot tha jisane nicksan ke prashasan ke kukarmon se aam janata ko parichit karaane main ek agrani bhoomika nibhaai thi
 The scandal eventually led to the resignation of President Nixon, as well as White House Chief of Staff H
R
 Haldeman, G
 Gordon Liddy, Agile Crowe, White House counsel Charles Coulson and John Dean, and presidential advisor John Erlikman were sentenced to prison
 waterget ke dauraan post ke prabandhkeey sampadak harvard simons ne "deep throt" ke upnaam kaa prayog ek aisi kukhyat ashleel film ke liye ek sanket ke rup main kiya jo us samay vivaad kaa ek pramukh kaaran tha
 The name was used as a journalistic term "deep background" to refer to information provided by a secret source that would not be reported directly under the agreement
 30 varshon se bhi adhik samay se deep throt kii pahchaan america raajnneeti or patrakarita ke sabase bade rahasyon main se ek or sarvaadhik saarvajanik jigyaasa evam atakalon ke rup main bani hui thi

 "after the Vanity Fair story was revealed, Woodward, Bernstein, and Benjamin C
 Bradley, who was the executive editor of the Post during Watergate, confirmed Felt's claim of being deep-throated
 epabiai ke purv kaaryakari nideshak or felt ke bos, el
 patric grey, apane bete aid grey ke saath milakar likhi gayi grey kii pustak, in nicksans web main akelaa strot hone ke felt ke daawey ko felt vivaadit bataate hai

C
 Police arrested five people at the offices of the Democratic National Committee on the sixth floor of the building of the Watergate Hotel
 police ghatana sthal par ek suraksha guard frank wills dwaara suchit kiye jane ke baad pahunchi thi, jisane yah dekha tha ki hotel main pravesh ke liye ek daravaaje ko khulaa chhod diya gaya tha
 The situation was unusual because the five thieves had a serial number of $ 2,300 in hundred-dollar leaves, some lock-picks and door-jimmies, a walkie talkie, a radio scanner to listen to police frequencies, two cameras, 40 reels of unused films, tear gas guns and state-of-the-art electronic equipment capable of recording all conversations in offices were found

 The scandal immediately attracted some media-related scrutiny

 Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, a young pair of Washington Post reporters, covered the development for a period of two years
 ghotaale main antat vividh prakaar ke kanoonee ulalanghanon ko shaamil dikhaaya gaya tha or isane nicksan white house ke kai sadasyon ko sajaa bhi sunai gayi
 With increasing pressure from the Senate and the courts, Nixon eventually became the first US president to resign, leading to impeachment by the House of Representatives
 woodward or bernastine kii kahaniyon main aisi jaankariyaan shaamil thi jo epabiai ke jaanchakartaaon dwaara khusasa kii gayi jaankariyon se ascharyajanak rup se ek samaan thi
 It was a glorious example of journalism that no other journalist had achieved at that time
 apni baad kii pustak ol da presidents main main woodward or bernastine ne daawa kiya yah jaankaree ek akele gumnaam mubir kii or se aayi thi jise "deep throt" kaa upnaam diya gaya tha
 It was later revealed and Woodward and Bernstein confirmed that Deep Throat FBI Deputy Director W
W
 Mark Felt was woodward ne varshon pehle felt ke saath dosti kii thi or waterget cond se pehle kai kahaniyon ke liye unase paraamarsh liya tha
 Woodward, Bernstein and others attribute the information provided by Deep Throat to being instrumental in ensuring the investigation into the Watergate scandal
 ol da presidents main main woodward pehali baar deep throt kaa ullekh prishth 71 par karte hai; isse pehle is pustak main ve uskaa ullekh is prakaar karte hai "ek purana dost or kabhi-kabhi ek aisa strot jo sangheey sarkaar ke liye kaam karata tha or jise apane offis main baat karnaa pasand nahin tha
 "
 Later he describes them as" a source in the executive branch who had access to CRP information as well as the White House "
 The book calls him" a very talkative person "," oversight of the executive branch " a person in a specific place to do, "and describes as" a man who has fought his battles in many places "
 woodward ne yah daawa kiya tha ki ve apane apartment kii balakani par ek phool ke gamale ke saath ek laal jhanda rakhkar "deep throt" se milane kaa sanket diya karte the
 When Deep Throat wanted to meet him, he put a special mark on page number twenty of Woodward's copy of The New York Times; They would round the page number and draw a clockwise needle to indicate the time
 ve aksar "roslin main kii brij ke thik upar ek bhumigat gairaaj ke nichle tal par" sabere 2:00 baje mulaaqaat kiya karte the
 This garage is located at 1401 Wilson Boulevard
 kai logon ko in gupt tareekon par andeh tha
 Adrian Havill investigated these claims for his 1993 biographies of Woodward and Bernstein and found them to be factually impossible
 unhone kaha ki washington main northwest ke 1718 pi street par sthit woodward ke apartment 617 main ek aantarik angan tha or yah sadak se dikhaai nahin detaa tha
 Havil said that anyone who regularly checks the balcony, as "deep Throat" allegedly did every day, must have been seen
 haivil ne yah bhi kaha ki da times kii pratiyon ko vyaktigat apartmenton main nahin diya jaataa tha balki inhen ek bina pate vaale dher ke rup main imaarat ke swaagat desk par saunp diya jaataa tha
 There would have been no way of knowing which copy was for Woodward
 haalanki, woodward ne kaha tha ki 1970 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main bhitari angan ek gali thi or ise abhi tak band nahin kiya gaya tha or yah ki unki balakani vahaan se guzarane vaale paidal yatriyon ko sadak ke str se dikhaai detii thi
 Woodward imagined that it could be visible to any FBI person under surveillance of nearby embassies
 unhone is tathy kaa bhi khulaasa kiya ki neuyork times kii woodward kii prati par uske apartment kaa number ankit hota tha
 Former neighbor Herman Knippenberg said that in search of a marked copy of the Woodward Times, he sometimes came to his door, claiming, "I like to keep it in the mint condition and i like to have my own copy"

 After his public disclosure of his identity, the Felt family called him an "american hero", saying he leaked information about the Watergate scandal to the Washington Post for moral and patriotic reasons

 Instead of demanding the Justice Department's lawyers or the House Judiciary Committee in charge of investigating the president's wrongdoings, he systematically leaked information to Woodward and Bernstein to keep their own identities and involvement securely confidential

 Although confirmation of Deep Throat's identity remained mysterious for more than 30 years, there were some suspicions that Felt had indeed been a reporter's mysterious source in 2005, long before public acceptance
 nicksan ne us samay felt ke bare main kaha tha ki vah "epabiai main jo kuch bhi jaanane ke liye he, sab kuch jaanata he
 "nixon's motive for not disclosing Felt may not have been entirely altruistic
 isamen koi shaq nahin he ki agar felt ne saarvajanik rup se un sari baton kaa khulaasa kiya hota jisaki unhen jaankaree thi, to vah aadmi jise sabase adhik kshati pahunch sakati thi, ve swayan nicksan hi the
 In February 2005, Nixon's former White House Counsel news columnist John Dean reported that Woodward had recently informed Bradley that "deep Throat" was ill and nearing death, and that Bradley wrote Deep Throat's obituary Was

 Felt became somewhat of a suspect, especially after the mysterious meeting between Woodward and Felt in the summer of 1999
 lekin anya logon ne varshon se is ore kahin adhik dhyaan diya tha, jaise ki pat bukanan, henry kisinger, tatkaaleen mukhya nyaayadhish wiliam renquist, general hegg or, yah pataa chalane se pehle ki "deep throt" nishchit rup se koi mahila nahin thi, dean soir
 On 31 May 2005, Vanity Fair magazine reported that William Mark Felt, aged 91 at the time, claimed that he was the man who was once known as "deep Throat"
 baad main usee din, woodward, bernastine or bradli ne da washington post ke madhyam se ek bayaan jari kar yah pushti kar di ki yah kahani sachhee thi
 On 2 June 2005, The Washington Post released a detailed main page written by Woodward detailing his friendship with Felt in the earlier years of Watergate
 woodward ne likhaa tha ve felt se pehali baar 1970 main sanyog vash mili the, jab woodward ek nausena ke leftinent the or apni umr ke tisare dashak ke madhya main the jinhen white house ke west wing main ek packet saunpane ke liye bheja gaya tha
 Felt arrived shortly thereafter for a separate visit and sat next to Woodward in the waiting room
 woodward ne ek baatcheet shuru kii jisase antat epabiai kii ucch str par unhen felt kii sthiti ke bare main jaankaree hui
 Woodward, who at the time was preparing to be fired from the Navy and was unsure of his future direction in life, decided to use Felt as a mentor and career advisor and so took Felt's phone number Took and kept in touch with them
 ek samvaadadaata ke rup main kariyar shuru karne kii koshish kaa nishchay karne ke baad, woodward antat agast 1971 main da washington post main shaamil ho gaye
 Felt, of whom Woodward writes that he had a long-blurred view of the Nixon administration, began giving pieces of information to Woodward, though he did not use any information written on the basis of information from the FBI and justice
 Had insisted with Woodward to keep the department separate
 may 1972 ke madhya main woodward ne pehali baar felt se praapt soochna kaa upyog washington post kii ek story main kiya, yah avasar waterget ghotaale se ek maheenaa pehle kaa tha jab woodward ek aise vyakti par reporting kar rahe the jisane raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar alabama ke jorge si
 vaalas kii htya karne kii koshish kii thi; nicksan ne is sambhavit htya kii jaanch kaa jimmaa felt ko saunpa tha
 a month later, a few days after Watargel's revelations, Woodward called Felt to his office, the first time Woodward had spoken to Felt about Watergate
 apane "deep throt" strot ke rup main kaam karne ke liye felt kii preranaon par tippanee karte hue woodward ne likhaa tha, "felt yah maanate the ki ve ek rasta nikaalkar beuro kii suraksha kar rahe the, jo itnaa gupt tha ki epabiai ke saakshatkaaron or filon se lee gayi kuch soochnaaon ko saarvajanik karne, nicksan or unke logon ko javabdeh banane ke liye naagarik or raajnneetik dabaav badhaane main madad karne main sakasham tha
 His intention was nothing but to condemn the Nixon White House and his efforts to reshuffle the bureau for political reasons
 " In 1980, Felt Weatherman himself was found guilty of ordering unlawful burglaries in suspects' homes and in their families
 richard nicksan ne unki ore se gavaahi di thi
 Felt was pardoned by President Ronald Reagan and the crime was subsequently removed from the record
 felt ke rahasyodghatan "main hi vah aadmi tha jise ve deep throt kaha karte the" or wood ward kii pushti se pehle, vaastavik deep throt kii pahchaan kar paane main itihaaskaaron or anya vidwaanon ko hui itani mushkil kaa kuch had tak kaaran yah he, kyonki koi bhi ek vyakti ol da presidents main main varnit paatr ke anusaar sahi tareeke se feet nahin lag rahaa tha
 It was for this reason that some scholars and commentators came to the conclusion that deep throat cannot possibly be a person and must be a composite form of multiple sources
 ek saahitiyik vyapaar ke drushtikon se, is siddhant ko us agent dwaara samarthan mila tha jisane multah ol da presidents main ke draft kii marketing kii thi, jisane kaha tha ki pustak kii shuruaati tipscript main deep throt kaa bilkul bhi koi sandarbh nahin tha
 He gave rise to speculations that Woodward and Bernstein played condensed history in the same way that Hollywood screenwriters do: the author sees dozens of real-life heroics doing great help, which in turn gives him Creates a person and gives him a fictitious name
 is siddhant ko mul rup se felt dwaara deep throt hone ke daawey ke aadhaar par rakhane kaa vichaar kiya gaya tha
 However, recent studies of FBI investigative files, notes issued by Woodward about his interactions with Deep Throat and Deep Throat in All the President's Man had revealed that Felt may have possibly led to Deep Throat All the related information will not be disclosed to Woodward
 vishesh rup se, deep throt par woodward ke nots kii apni jaanch-padtaal main aid grey in tippaniyon ko uddhrut karte hai jisamen deep throt ko yah kehete hue bataaya gaya he "mishael ne das dinon tak swayan jaanch-padtaal kii or 'vah pagal hua ja rahaa tha --- hamane madad ke liye unhen kuch log bhi saunpe the'

 If there had been FBI agents "hired for help" who had "got all kinds of new things," not only would the Watergate case have been exposed in those first ten days, but the fbi's files would have been filled with FD-302 of the resulting interviews
 No one is present there
 " Gray also cites a conversation he had with Donald Santarelli, a Justice Department official during the Watergate period, in which Gray mentions the contents of some of Woodward's remarks that he was related to Deep Throat

 However, this claim made by Fielding has not been confirmed
 ek kaaran jise kai visheshgy maanate the ki "deep throt" fielding hi the, naa ki felt, aisa ek saakshaatkaar main woodward kaa is baat se spasht inkaar karne kii vajah se tha ki "deep throt" ne ek khufia samudaay main kaam kiya tha: Looking back, it seems that Woodward was only separating foreign intelligence agencies from his statement, not the FBI

 The man accompanied the servant to the court
 apane saath vah aisa kaath kaa ghode laayaa jisaki kaarigari dekhte banati thi
 He seemed to be alive
 bahut gaur se dekhne par hi pataa chalata tha ki lakdi kaa he
 Vikram asked the man about the characteristics of the horse
 us aadmi ne jawaab diya ki vah ghoda ati teevr gati se jal, thal or akaash- teenon main vicharan kar saktaa he
 When asked about his price, he told that this is the fruit of his life's hard work, so he will not sell it for less than one lakh gold coins
 raja ko uski baat janch gai or ek lakh swarna-mudraayen dekar unhone vah ghoda kharid liya
 Then the man came to the open ground and picked up the horse and began to show everything about his part
 uske sanchaalan kii sari vidhi samajhakar vikram ne ghoda apane ashwagar main rakhwa diya
 One day when the king went out hunting with his men, he himself rode on the same horse

 When it was morning, the sannyasin splashed on the princess by taking a full water from the second pitcher
 rajkumaari phir se bandariyaa ban gai
 The monk took him out of the hut and left him, leaving him free in the forest
 uske jane ke baad bandariyaa ko lekar vikram kutiyaa main aae or ghade se pani lekar bandariyaa par chhinte daal die
 The Bandariya again became an indefinable beauty
 rajkumaari banate hi usne raja ko bataaya ki vah kaamdev tathaa ek apsara kii santan hoon

 Groaning with pain, the monk cursed me that i would have to serve the monk as a monkey
 jab main roi-gidgidai ki yah sab anjaane main hua to usne pasijkar shraap se mukti kaa rasta bataaya
 He said that King Vikramaditya will come and liberate you from the curse and will choose you as his wife if that sage will give you something as a gift
 "main aapako dekhte hi pahchaan gai thi
 Now when the monk returns, i will ask him for a gift and you will select me as his wife
 " vikram ne phir pani ke chhinte daalkar use bandariyaa bana diya
 The monk came and he turned her into a princess from the monkey
 rajkumaari ne usase koi uphaar dene ko kaha
 When he waved his hand in the air, a lotus fed in his hand arrived
 usne kaha yah camel har din tumhen ek ratna degaa
 The monk also said that he knew King Vikramaditya had come into his life, so he blessed the princess to spend the rest of the life happily
 sadhu ne uske baad rajkumaari ko apni kutiyaa se saharsha vidaa kiya
 The princess was now completely curse free
 vikram ne tab donon betaalon kaa samaran kiya jo un donon ko nagar kii seemaa par pahunchaa kar gaayab ho gaya
 When they entered the city, a child was trying to get a lotus flower
 vikram ne vah camel kaa phool bachche ko turant dekar santusht kiya
 Then reached the palace and started watching the administration
 kuch dinon baad unke paas ek garib aadmi ko pakadkar laayaa gaya
 He was arrested on charges of selling precious stones
 raja ke poochne par usne bataaya ki uske bachche ko kisi ne ek khilaa camel diya tha, usee camel se ye ratna use praapt hue hai
 Vikram scolded the soldiers for doubting the honesty of anyone and without reason and bought all the gems themselves at a good price

 In 1978, the National Engineering Manufacturers Association issued a "standard" for programmable microcontrollers, which consisted of controllers based on almost any computer, including single-boarded computers, digital, and event-based computers
 microprocessors or microcontrolrs kii laagat kam ho jane ke kaaran ghundi-aadhaarit mahange analog ghatakon, jaise potenshiometers or veriable capacitars ke sthaan par microprocesar dwaara padhi jane vaali ap / down batano yaa ghundiyon kaa kuch upabhokta utpaadon main bhi prayog kar paanaa saadhy ho gaya
 By the mid-1980s, most of the earlier common external system components had been integrated into the processor chip itself, and this modern form of microcontrollers allowed more widespread use, extending to almost all electronics devices by the end of the decade Exceptions had become the norm
 jin anuprayogon ke liye ambeded systams kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, microcontrolrs ke ekikaran ne aage un kshetron main or vruddhi kii, jinamein paaramparik rup se ek computer kaa prayog karne kaa vichaar na kiya gaya hota

 Often they use DOS,]], netbsd or an embedded real-time operating system, such as microc / OS-II, QNX or vxworks
 kabhi-kabhi ye bords gaiyr-x86 processors kaa prayog bhi karte hai
 Components used in some specific applications, where small size or energy-efficiency are not primary concerns, may be compatible with components used in general-purpose x86 personal computers
 kuch bords, jaise VIA EPIA shrenee, pc-susangat lekin atyadhik ekikrut, bhautik rup se chote hone ke kaaran is kami ko puraa karne main sahaayta karte hai yaa inamen kuch aise lakshan hote hai, jo ambeded ejiniers ko inaki ore aakarshith karte hai
 The advantage of this method is that low-cost content components can be used alongside software development tools used for general software development
 is prakaar banaae gaye systams ko bhi ambeded mana jaataa he kyonki ve bade upkarnon main ekikrut kiye jate hai or kisi ekal bhoomika kii purti karte hai
 atms and arcade machines that contain specific code for the application may be examples of devices using this method

 a common design style is a small, perhaps the size of a business card, system module, high-density BGA chips, such as an arm-based system-on-a-chip processor and external devices, external flash memory for storage, and runtime memory Uses DRAM for
 modul vikreta saamanyat: boot software pradaan karegaa or is baat ko sunishchit karegaa ki ek oparating system kaa chunaav kiya gaya he, jinamein saamanyat: ]] or kuch real-time vikalp shaamil hote hai
 These modules can be produced on a large scale by organizations that are familiar with their specialized testing issues and can be combined with traditional mainboards built on a very small scale with application-specific external devices
 gamsticks utpaada panktiyaan is model kaa ek linaks -kendrit udhaaharan hai
 System-on-a-chip is a common configuration for highly-large-scale embedded systems, in which a complete system with multiple processors, multipliers, caches, and interfaces occurs on a single chip
 socs ko ek anuprayog-vishisht ekikrut circuit ke rup main yaa ek field-programeble get aire kaa prayog karke lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 Embedded systems communicate with the outside world via peripheral devices, such as: anya softwares kii hi tarah ambeded system diziners bhi ambeded system software viksit karne ke liye compilers, asembalars or dibgars kaa prayog karte hai
 However, they may also use some of the more specialized equipment
 software upkaran vibhinn stroton se aa sakate hai: As the complexity of embedded systems is increasing, high-end equipment and operating systems are moving into the machinery where they are meant to be
 udhaaharan ke liye, cellphone, personal digital asistants tathaa anya upabhokta computers ke liye aksar lakshaneey software kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jo electranix ke utpaadak ke atirikt kisi anya vyakti dwaara kharida yaa pradaan kiya jaataa he
 Such systems require a free programming environment, such as:]], netbsd, osgi or embedded Java, so that the third-party software provider can sell them to a larger market
 uplabdh suvidhaon ke aadhaar par ambeded dibging vibhinn staron par kii ja sakati he
 They can be broadly classified into the following areas, from the simplest to the most sophisticated: jab tak bahari dibging ko pratibandhit na kiya jaye, tab tak programmer vishisht rup se software ko upkarnon dwaara lod kar saktaa he or chalaa saktaa he, procesar main chal rahe code ko dekh saktaa he or kaary ko shuru yaa band kar saktaa he
 The code can be viewed as assembly code or source-code
 chunki ek ambeded system aksar vibhinn prakaar ke tatwon se milakar bana hota he, at: dibging ranneeti bhi alag-alag ho sakati he
 For example, debugging a software-centric embedded system is different from debugging an embedded system where most of the processing is done by peripheral devices
 ek se adhik ekal procesar kor kaa prayog karne vaale ambeded systams kii sankhya lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 Proper synchronization of software implementation is a common problem with multi-core development

 ek logic analiser ke saath, bahut nimna-str kii dibging kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Embedded systems, often in such machines, are expected to work continuously for many years without errors and in some cases recover from them if errors occur
 isliye personal computer kii tulana main aksar software adhik satarkatapurvak viksit kiya or jaancha jaataa he or discs drivs, switch or batano jaise gatiman yantric bhaagon, jo vishwasaneey nahin hote, ke prayog se bachaa jaataa he
 Typical reliability issues may include: trutiyon se ubarne ke liye vibhinn prakaar kii takneekon kaa prayog, kabhi-kabhi sanyojit rup se, kiya jaataa he- memory li jaisi software trutiyon or saath hi hardware kii saamaanya trutiyon, donon ke liye: For high-volume systems, such as portable music players or mobile phones, reducing costs is usually the primary consideration during design
 ejiniers vishishtat: aise hardware kaa chayan karte hai, jo aavashyak kaaryon ko lagu karne ke liye keval "paryaapt" ho
 General-purpose computers can be adapted to low-volume or prototype embedded systems by limiting programs or by replacing the operating system with a real-time operating system
 vibhinn prakaar kii software sanrachanaon kaa prayog prachlit he
 In this design, the software has only one loop
 yah loop sab-routines ko kol karata he, jinamein se prayek dwaara hardware yaa software ke ek bhaag kaa prabandhan kiya jaataa he
 Some embedded systems are primarily controlled by interrupts
 iskaa arth yah he ki system dwaara kiye jane vaale kaary vibhinn prakaar kii ghatnaon dwaara shuru kiye jate hai
 For example, an interrupt can be generated at a pre-defined interval by a timer or by a serial port controller receiving one byte
 yadi event handlers ko nimna-vilambtaa kii aavashyaktaa ho tathaa event handlers chote or saral hon, to is prakaar ke systams kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Generally, these types of systems also perform a simple task in a main loop, but this task is not very sensitive to unexpected delays
 kabhi-kabhi interpt handler lambe kaaryon ko ek pankti-sanrachana main jod degaa
 These functions are then executed by the main loop when the interrupt handler is finished
 yah vidhi system ko asatat prakriyaaon vaale ek multi-tasking karnal ke nikat le jaati he
 a non-preemptive multi-tasking system is also similar to a simple control loop scheme, the only difference being that the loop is hidden in an API
 programmer kaaryon kii ek shrinkhalaa ko paribhaashit karata he or prayek kaary ko apana swayan kaa ek vaataavaran praapt hota he, jisamen ise "kriyanvit" kiya jaataa he
 When a task is inactive, it calls an inactive routine, usually called "pause", "wait", "yield", "nop" etc
 iske laabh or haniyaan niyantran loop ke samaan hi hai, antar keval itnaa he ki nayaa software jodna saral hota he, keval ek nayaa kaary likhaa jaataa he yaa ise kyuu-interprator main jod diya jaataa he
 In this type of system, a low-level piece of code keeps exchanging between tasks or threads based on a timer
 is str par saamanyat: yah mana jaataa he ki system main ek "oparating karnal" upasthit he
 Depending on how much functionality is required, it conceptually presents more or less complexities for managing multiple tasks being executed in a parallel state
 chunki koi bhi code sambhavit rup se kisi anya kaary ke data ko haani pahunchaa saktaa he, at: programs kii rachana evam pareekshan satarkatapurvak kiya janaa chahie, tathaa saajha kiye gaye data kaa niyantran kisi sinchroniteeshan ranneeti, jaise sandesh-pankti, semafor yaa kisi gaiyr-avarodhi sinchroniteeshan yojana dwaara anivaary rup se kiya janaa chahie
 Due to these complexities, it is common practice for organizations to purchase a real-time operating system that allows application programmers to focus on the functionality of devices rather than operating system services, at least for larger systems
 is; Smaller systems cannot afford the additional costs associated with a common real-time system due to limitations in memory size, performance, and / or battery life, etc
 ek microkarnal taarkik rup se real-time OS kaa aglaa charan hota he
 The common setup is that the operating system allocates kernel memory and exchanges cpus on different threads of execution
 yuzar mod prakriyaayein mukhya kaaryon, jaise fil system, network interfes aadi ko lagu karti hai
 In general, microkernels are successful when the exchange of tasks and communication between tasks are intense and fail when they are slow
 exokarnal saamaanya sabaroutine colls ke dwaara dakshatapurvak samvaad karte hai
 The entire software in the hardware and system is available to and financed by application programmers
 is sthiti main, ambeded vaataavaran ke anuroop banane ke liye parishkrut kshamtaaon vaale ek apekshaakrit bade karnal kaa anukulan kiya jaataa he
 It provides programmers with an environment similar to a desktop operating system like]] or]] and is therefore very productive for development; On the other hand it typically requires a high amount of hardware resources, is more expensive and is less predictable and less reliable due to the complexity of these kernels
 ]] or ]] ambeded monolithik karnal ke saamaanya udhaaharan hai
 Despite increasing hardware costs, the popularity of such embedded systems is increasing, especially on more powerful embedded devices, such as wireless routers and GPS navigation systems
 iske kuch kaaran ye hai: a small portion of embedded systems require safe, timely, reliable or efficient behavior, which cannot be achieved by any of the above structures
 In such a situation the organization constructs a suitable system
 kuch sthitiyon main, vishesh takneekon kaa prayog karke system ko ek "kriyavidhi niyantrak " or ek paaramparik oparating system ke saath ek "pradarshan niyantrak " main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 a communication system exchanges data between the two
 mul oparating system ke alaava, anek ambeded systams main ucch-parat vaale atirikt software ghatak hote hai
 These components have protocol stacks such as CAN, TCP / IP, FTP, HTTP and HTTPS and also include storage capabilities such as FAT and flash memory management systems
 yadi ambeded upkaran main audio tathaa video kshamtaayen hai, to upyukt driver evam kodex system main upasthit honge
 In the case of monolithic kernels, many of these software layers are involved

 yadi yagyopavit na hua ho, to nayaa yagyopavit or ho gaya ho, to ek ke sthaan par joda pehanaane kaa sanskaar vidhiwat kiya janaa chahie
 It is good that the order of holding Yajnopavit in the morning should be arranged in an orderly manner on the auspicious day on which the marriage ceremony is to be held
 vivaah-sanskaar ke liye saje hue var ke vastra aadi utaravakar yagyopavit pehanaanaa atapata-sa lagata he
 That is why it should be completed before

 This part is a personal feature of Bhattikavya, presenting an example of language language

 Certain reviewers consider the poet's full name as Bhartrihari, but this Bhartrihari is certainly different from Bhatruhari, the creator of the Shatatraya or the principal of the syntactic
 bhatti upnaam bhartruhari kavi valbhinaresh shridhar sen se sambandhit he
 The time of Mahakavi Bhatti is unanimous in the late sixth century AD
 alankaar varg main nidarshit udaahranon se spasht prathit hota he ki bhatti or bhamah ek hi parampara ke anuyaayi hai
 For nearly 10 centuries before Bhattikavya's composition, Panini's Ashtadhyayi's deep reading was going on
 bhatti kaa uddeshy ashtaadhi ke adhyayan ko aasaan banane vaala saadhan nirmit karnaa tha
 He did this by associating the examples given in the grammar texts already existing with the Ramakatha

 He sent a message through him that if Shivaji accepts the subjugation of Bijapur, the Sultan will give him the right to all the areas which are under Shivaji's control
 saath hi shivaji ko bijapur ke darbar main ek sammanit pad praapt hoga
 Though Shivaji's minister and advisor was in favor of As Sandhi, Shivaji did not like these talks
 unhone krishnaji bhaskar ko uchit sammaan dekar apane darbar main rakh liya or apane doot gopinath ko vastusthiti kaa jayja lene afjal khan ke paas bheja
 From Gopinath and Krishnaji Bhaskar, Shivaji felt that Afzal Khan wanted to imprison Shivaji by plotting a treaty

 Shivaji was in trouble, but taking advantage of the darkness of the night, he managed to escape
