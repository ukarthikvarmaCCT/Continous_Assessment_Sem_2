 unhone apana jivan shikshak ke rup main armbh kiya tha tathaa paathya pustakon or hindi pustakon ke abhaav ne unhen prakaashan vyavsaay ke liye prerit kiya tha
 He himself produced text books and wrote books from others
 in kritiyon kaa prakaashan khadg vilaas press ne kiya
 If Bharatendu Babu Harishchandra and the writers of his era are the creators of modern Hindi literature, it would certainly be appropriate to consider Kharag Vilas Press and its founder as their sole publisher
 yadi maharaj kumaar ram deen singh kaa sadbhaav or sahyog na mila hota to bhaaratendu harishchandra or unke samakaleen sahityakaron ko apni rachanaaon ke vyavasthit prakaashan kaa itnaa acha suyog nahin mila hota
 ' ‘is prakaashan santhaan ne bhaaratendu harishchandra, pandit pratap narayan mishra, pandit ambika dutt vyas, pandit sheetala prasad treepathi, bhartiya civil seva main hindi ke pratishthapak fredrick pinkaat, aadhunik hindi khadi boli ke pratham mahakavy priypravas ke praneta pandit ayodhyasingh upaadhyaay 'hariudh', pandit damodar shastri sapre, laal khadg bahadur mall, shiv nandan sahay prabhruti sahityakaron ko prakashkeey sangrakshan pradaan kiya or unki kritiyon ke prakaashan par muktahast se vyay kiya
 ' ‘hindi bhashi pradeshon main sabase pehle bihar pradesh main san 1835 main hindi andolan shuru hua tha
 As a result of this relentless effort, in 1875, Hindi was established in the courts and schools in Bihar, but there was a complete lack of text books
 khadg vilaas press ne vibhinn vishyon main paathya pustaken taiyaar kara kar inkaa prakaashan kiya
 Sahib Prasad Singh, Umanath Mishra, Chandi Prasad Singh, Kali Prasad Mishra, Preman Pandey Prabhriti writers actively collaborated in this direction
 sahab prasad singh kii ‘bhashaa saar’ naamak pustak san 1884 se 1936 tak bihar ke skulon or kalejon main padhai jaati rahi
 Ram Din Singh's childhood was spent in Taranpur village in Patna district where his maternal uncle's home was

 He was the Parliamentary Secretary in the Cabinet formed in 1937 under the leadership of Dr

 He represented Patna in the Lok Sabha from 1952 to 1962
 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga The sermon that Shri Krishna preached to Arjuna in the battlefield of Kuru region is known as Srimad Bhagavadgita
 yah mahabharat ke bhishmaparv kaa ang he
 The Gita has 18 chapters and 720 verses
 jaisaa gita ke shankar bhashya main kaha he- tan dharman bhagawata yathopadisht vedavyas: sarvagyobhagavan gitakhyai: saptabhi: shlokashatairu panibandh
 It is known that in the early 20th century, in front of Geeta Press Gorakhpur, there was the same text of Geeta which is available to us today
 20veen sadi ke lagbhag bhishmaparv kaa java kii bhashaa main ek anuwaad hua tha
 Many basics are also safe in it
 shripad krishna belwelkar ke anusaar java ke is pracheen sanskaran main gita ke keval saadhe ikyasi shloke mul sanskrit ke hai
 They also support the current text
 gita kii gananaa prasthaantrayee main kii jaati he, jisamen upanishad or brahmasutra bhi sanmilit hai
 Therefore, according to Indian tradition, the place of Gita is the same as that of Upanishads and Brahmasutras
 gita ke mahatmaya main upanishdon ko gau or gita ko uskaa dugdh kaha gaya he
 This means that the Gita accepts the spirituality of the Upanishads in the Sarvansh
 upanishdon kii anek vidyaayein gita main hai
 For example, Ashwattha lore in relation to the nature of the world, Avyayamusha lore in the context of eternal Ajna Brahma, Aksha Purushu vidha in the matter of Para Prakriti or Jiva, and Ksharapurushu Vidya concerning Apara Prakriti or material world
 is prakaar vedon ke brahmavaad or upanishdon ke aadhyatm, in donon kii vishisht saamagree gita main sannivisht he
 In the words of Pushpika it is called theology
 gita main 'brahmavidya' kaa aashay nivrittiparak gyanmarg se he
 It is called Sankhyamat with which the Nivitvarigi Vibhagya is associated
 lekin gita upanishdon ke mode se aage badhkar us yug kii dein he, jab ek nayaa darshan janm le rahaa tha jo grihasthon ke pravriti dharm ko nivritti maarg ke samakaksh or utana hi faldaayak maanata tha
 The same signifies the word 'yogashastra' in the Pushpika of the Gita
 yahan ‘yogashastre’ kaa abhipraay ni:andeh karmyog se hi he
 Two definitions of yoga are found in the Gita
 ek nivritti maarg kii drushti se jisamen ‘samatvam yoga uchyate’ kaha gaya he arthath gunon ke vaishamy main samyabhav rakhana hi yoga he
 This is the position of Sankhya
 yoga kii duusari paribhaasha he ‘yoga: karmsu kaushalam’ arthath karmon main lage rahane par bhi aise upaay se karm karnaa ki vah bandhan kaa kaaran na ho or karm karanevaala usee asang yaa nirlep sthiti main apane ko rakh sake jo gyanamargiyon ko milti he
 The name of this device is Buddhayog and this is the essence of the Yoga of the Gita
 gita ke duusare adhyay main jo ‘tasya pragnapratishthita’ kii dhun pai jaati he, uskaa abhipraay nirlep karm kii kshamtavali buddhi se hi he
 This was not a situation of attaining renunciation by the renunciation of karma, but a plan to elevate the pre-existing mind to a state of disinterest while performing karma
 yahi gita kaa karmyog he
 Just as in many places in the Mahabharata, so is the interpretation and appreciation of the Sankhya path of Sankhya and the path of Karma
 ek kii ninda or duusare kii prashansa gita kaa abhimath nahin, donon maarg do prakaar kii ru chi rakhanevaale manushyon ke liye hitkar ho sakate hai or hai
 Probably no other book of the world renders the scripture of Karma with this beauty, this subtlety and objectivity
 is drushti se gita adbhut maanviya shaastra he
 Its vision is not one-sided, but all-round
 gita main darshan kaa pratipaadan karte hue bhi jo sahitya kaa anand he vah isaki atirikt visheshta he
 The description of the philosophy through cultured poetry is the personal grief of the Gita, which does not remain without enchanting any heart
 isiilie iskaa naam bhagavadgita padaa, bhagavan kaa gaaya hua gyaan
 The background of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita is the war of Mahabharata
 jis prakaar ek saamaanya manushya apane jivan kii samasyaon main ulajhakar kinkartavyavimudh ho jaataa he or uske pashchaat jivan ke samarangan se palaayan karne kaa man bana letaa he usee prakaar arjuna jo mahabharat kaa mahanayake he apane saamne aane vaali samasyaon se bhaybheet hokar jivan or kshatriya dharm se niraash ho gaya he, arjuna kii tarah hi ham sabhi kabhi-kabhi anishchay kii sthiti main yaa to hataash ho jate hai or yaa phir apni samasyaon se udign hokar kartavya vimukh ho jate hai
 The sages of India, after deep thought, imbibed the knowledge they gave to the Vedas
 inhen vedon kaa antim bhaag upanishad kehalaata he
 The characteristic of human life is the intellectual power acquired by human beings, and the knowledge contained in the Upanishads is not only the highest state of human intelligence but also gives a glimpse of what man can experience beyond the limits of intellect
 gita ke 18 adhyyon main varnit vishyon kii bhi kramprapt sangati he
 The name of the first chapter is Arjunvishad Yoga
 vah gita ke upadesh kaa vilakshan naatakeey rangamanch prastut karata he jisamen shrota or vaktaa donon hi kutuhal shanti ke liye nahin varan jivan kii pragadh samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye pravrutt hote hai
 Shaurya and patience, courage and strength made Arjuna's personality with the impressive amount of these four qualities and above all these four qualities were one and forgiveness, the other is wisdom
 balpradhan kshatradharm se praapt honevaali sthiti main pahunchakar sahasaa arjuna ke chitt par ek duusare hi prakaar ke manobhaav kaa akraman hua, carpanya kaa
 a strange kind of compassion filled his mind and his faint nature vanished
 jis kartavya ke liye vah katibaddh hua tha usase vah vimukh ho gaya
 On looking from above, his arguments in favor of this situation seem to be religious, but he himself has called it Karpanya Dosh and it is believed that due to this cuteness of mind, his natal nature was hurt or destroyed
 vah nirnay nahin kar paa rahaa tha ki yuddh kare athwa vairaygy le le
 What to do, what not to do, was not understood
 is manobhaav kii charam sthiti main pahunchakar usne dhanushbaan ek ore daal diya
 Krishna saw Arjuna's condition that Arjuna's body was fine but before the start of the war, the morale of that wonderful Kshatriya was broken
 bina man ke yah sharir khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Therefore, a guru duty came in front of Krishna
 at: tark se, buddhi se, gyaan se, karm kii charchaa se, vishwa ke swabhaav se, usamen jivan kii sthiti se, donon ke niamak avyay purush ke parichay se or us sarvopari param sattavan brahm ke saakshaat darshan se arjuna ke man kaa uddhaar karnaa, yahi unka lakshya hua
 The subject of this discussion is Gita
 pehle adhyay main saamaanya reeti se bhoomika rup main arjuna ne bhagwaan se apni sthiti kah di
 The second chapter is named Sankhyayoga
 isamen jivan kii do pracheen sanmanit paramparaon kaa tarkon dwaara varnan aayaa he
 Seeing Arjuna weeping in that sorrowful condition, Krishna has brought to his attention that this type of claviness and petty infirmity of heart is not suitable for a hero like Arjun
 krishna ne arjuna kii ab tak di hui sab yuktiyon ko pragnawad kaa jhootha rup kaha
 His trick is that Pragyadarshana essentially accepts all the events and situations of the world from time, karma and nature
 jeena or maranaa, janm lenaa or badhanaa, vishyon kaa aana or janaa
 Experiences of happiness and sorrow, these occur only in the world, this was also called the ancient Acharya synonymism
 kaal kii chakragati in sab sthitiyon ko laati he or le jaati he
 After knowing this nature of life, there is no mourning again
 yahi bhagwaan kaa vyangy he ki pragna ke drushtikon ko maanate hue bhi arjuna is prakaar ke moh main kyon pad gaya he
 An essential part of the above view was the continuity of life and the impermanence of the body
 nity jeev ke liye shok karnaa utana hi vyarth he jitna anitya sharir ko bachaane kii chintaa
 Both of these are unavoidable
 janm or mrityu baari baari se hote hi hai, aisa samajhakar shok karnaa uchit nahin he
 Then another view is of apostasy
 janm se hi prakruti ne sabake liye ek dharm niyat kar diya he
 In it comes the path of life, the periphery of desires, the power of karma
 isse nikal kar nahin bhaaga ja saktaa
 Even if someone runs away, nature again pulls him
 is prakaar kaal kaa parivartan yaa pariman, jeev kii nityata or apana swadharm yaa swabhaav jin yuktiyon se bhagavan, ne arjuna ko samajhaayaa he use unhone sankhya kii buddhi kaha he
 Further, even after Arjuna did not question, he also described the wisdom of the yogamarga
 yah buddhi karm yaa pravriti maarg ke aagrah kii buddhi he isamen karm karte hue karm ke fal kii aasakti se apane ko bachaana aavashyak he
 The biggest fear for the Karmayogi is that he gets trapped in the party of desire for fruit; He should avoid it
 arjuna ko andeh hua ki kya is prakaar kii buddhi praapt karnaa sambhav he
 What would be the situation of a person if he did deeds and no fruit, it was a practical doubt
 usne poocha ki is prakaar kaa drudh pragnawala vyakti jivan kaa vyavhaar kaise karata he? aana, janaa, khaanaa, pinaa, karm karnaa, unamem lipt hokar bhi nirlep kaise rahaa ja saktaa he? krishna ne kitne hi prakaar ke bahya indriyon kii apeksha man ke sanyam kii vyakhya kii he
 Through work, anger, fear, raga, malice, the mild mind is disturbed and the senses are not in control
 indriyajay hi sabase badi aatmajay he
 Even if someone gives up subjects from outside, the inner mind does not agree
 vishyon kaa swaad jab man se jaataa he, tabhi man prafullit, shant or sukhi hota he
 Rivers come in the sea, but he does not give up his dignity
 aise hi sansar main rahete hue, uske vyavhaaron ko sweekaarte hue, anek kaamanaayon kaa pravesh man main hota rahata he
 But those who do not lose their dignity only get peace
 ise pracheen aadhyatm paribhaasha main gita main brahmisthiti kaha he
 Thus, listening to the answer of Sankhya's explanation, in the third chapter called Karmayoga, Arjuna asked a clear question to get deeper into the subject that Sankhya and Yoga do you think well in both these passages and why not say that i am in both of them Whom should i adopt? To this, Krishna replied with the same clearness that there are two loyalties or lifespans in the world - jnana yoga for the Samkhists and karmayoga for the Karmargamis
 yahan koi vyakti karm chhod hi nahin saktaa
 Nature compels a person to perform actions with the effect of all three qualities
 karm se bachnewaalon ke prati ek badi shankaa he, vah yah ki ve upar se to karm chhod baithte hai par man hi man usamen duube rahete hai
 This situation is unbearable and Krishna has called it falsehood in the Gita
 man main karmedriyon ko rokkar karm karnaa hi saral maanviya maarg he
 Krishna even said as a challenge that without karma one cannot get food to eat
 phir krishna ne karm ke vidhaan ko chakra ke rup main upasthit kiya
 Not only are the creations of different persons threaded together on the social plane, but the relationship between man on earth and God of heaven is also dependent on the action cycle
 pratyaksh he ki yahan manushya karm karte hai, krishi karte hai or daivi shaktiyaan vrishti kaa jal bhejti hai
 Both grain and purgenes arise from karma
 ek main maanviya karm, duusare main daivi karm
 Then in favor of Karma, the idea of lok Sangraha has been given, that is, without Karma, the structure of society cannot stand
 jo lok ke netaa hai, janak jaise gyani hai, ve bhi karm main pravriti rakhte hai
 Krishna himself gave his own illustration and said that i am the form of Narayana, there is no work left for me
 phir bhi tandrarahit hokar karm karata hoon or anya log mere maarg par chalate hai
 The difference is that those who are foolish do the work by indulging but the knowledgeable does the work with disrespect
 gita main yaheen ek sabhipraay shabd buddhibhed he
 That is, it is not proper to uproot the people of ordinary understanding who are engaged in karma, because they cannot become knowledgeable, and if their karma is missed, then they will go astray on both sides
 chauthe adhyay main, jiskaa naam gyaan-karm-sanyas-yoga he, yah bataaya gaya he ki gyaan praapt karke karm karte hue bhi karmsanyas kaa fal kis upaay se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In this true Karmayoga is considered to occur in the tradition of the Chakravarti kings
 mandhata, sudarshan aadi anek chakravarti raajaaon ke drushtaant die gaye hai
 This is the famous assurance of the Gita that when there is defamation of religion, then there is an incarnation of God among humans, that is, the power of God is especially tangible
 yaheen par ek vaakya vishesh dhyaan dene yogya he- kshipran hi manushe loke siddhirbhavatee karmaja 
 'karma se siddhi' - There is no more effective sutra in Gitadarshan
 kintu gitatv is sutara main itnaa sudhaar or karata he ki vah karm asang bhav se arthath falasakti se bachakar karnaa chahie
 In the fifth chapter, again she has gone somewhere in the form of tips and perseverance
 isamen karm ke saath jo man kaa sambandh he, uske sanskaar par yaa use vishuddh karne par vishesh dhyaan dilaayaa gaya he
 It has also been said that there is no difference between Sankhya and Yoga by reaching a high level
 kisi ek maarg par thik prakaar se chale to samaan fal praapt hota he
 By surrendering all the deeds of life, a person reaches the pole point of absolute peace and does not indulge in karmic water like a lotus blooming in water
 chatha adhyay aatmasanyam yoga he jiskaa vishay naam se hi prakat he
 The number of subjects is the restraint of the most senses - this is the squeeze of karma and knowledge
 sukh main or dukh main man kii samaan sthiti, ise hi yoga kehete hai
 The noun of the seventh chapter is Jnana Vigyan Yog
 ye pracheen bhartiya darshan kii do paribhaashaayen hai
 Among them, the word science was very important from the Vedic point of view
 sristi ke nanaatv kaa gyaan vigyaan he or nanaatv se ekatv kii ore pragati gyaan he
 Both these views are suitable for humans
 is prasang main vigyaan kii drushti se aparaa or para prakruti ke in do roopon kii jo sunishchit vyakhya yahan gita ne di he, vah avashya dhyaan dene yogya he
 Apara Prakriti has eight elements, Panchabhuta, Mind, Wisdom and Ego
 jis and se maanav kaa janm hota he
 These eight live in it
 kintu yah praakrit sarg he arthath yah jad he
 In this, the consciousness that comes from contact with the efforts of God is called Para Prakriti; He is a living being
 aath tatwon ke saath milakar jivan navaan tatv ho jaataa he
 In this chapter, many forms of God are mentioned, whose further expansion comes in the tenth chapter called Vibhutiog
 yaheen vishesh bhagwati drushti kaa bhi ullekh he jiskaa sutara-vasudev: sarvamiti, sab vasu yaa shariron main ek hi devtatv he, usee kii sangya vishnu he
 But in the people according to their own idi, the same deity is worshiped in many names and forms
 ve sab thik hai
 But it is good that a wise person recognizes the universe which is the highest peak of spiritual science
 aathven adhyay kii sangya akshar brahmyog he
 Akshar Vidya expanded in Upanishads
 gita main us aksharavidya kaa saar kah diya gaya he-akshar brahm paraman, arthath parabrahm kii sangya akshar he
 Spirituality is the name of the combined composition of man, that is, organism and body
 jeevasanyukt bhautik deh kii sangya kshar he or keval shaktitatv kii sangya aadhidaivak he
 The way these three powers work together in the body, the God, and the ghost are called Adhigyas
 gitakar ne do shlokon main in chah paribhaashaon kaa swaroop band diya he
 In the words of Gita, ॐ monosyllable is Brahman
 nawein adhyay ko raajaguhyayog kaha gaya he, arthath yah aadhyatm vidya vidyaraji he or yah guhya gyaan sabamein shreshth he
 The word Raja also had a meaning in mind
 atev man kii divya shaktimayon ko kis prakaar brahmamay banaaya jaay, isaki yukti hi rajvidya he
 In this area, the representation of Brahmanism is predominant, from which the creation of the expressed world is repeated
 veda kaa samast karmkand yajna, amrit, or mrityu, sant or asant, or jitne bhi devi devtaa he, sabakaa paryavsaan brahm main he
 The variety of Devpuja which is popular in the world is also right in its place, this vision of coordination was acceptable to the Bhagwat Acharyas, in fact it was their great power
 isi drushtikon kaa vichaar yaa vyakhya dasven adhyay main pai jaati he
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 iskaa saar yah he ki lok main jitne devtaa hai, sab ek hi bhagwaan, kii vibhutiyaan hai, manushya ke samast gun or avagun bhagwaan kii shakti ke hi rup hai
 Wisdom may be able to explain these liberated gods, but they are there in the world
 koi pipal ko pooj rahaa he
 Some mountain, river or sea, some fish and turtles
 yon kitne devtaa hai, iskaa koi ant nahin
 This abundance of deities is found everywhere in the history of the world
 bhagwaton ne inaki satta ko sweekaarte hue sabko vishnu kaa rup maanakar samanvay kii ek nai drushti pradaan kii
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 jo satv jeev balayukt athwa chamatkarayukt he, vah sab bhagwaan kaa rup he
 Considering this, the mind gets into an uncontrolled state
 11wein adhyay kaa naam vishvaroopadarshan yoga he
 In this, Arjuna saw the world form of God
 viraat rup kaa arth he maanviya dharaatal or paridhi ke upar jo anant vishwa kaa pranavant rachanavidhan he, uskaa saakshaat darshan
 The quadrilateral form of Vishnu is benign on the human plane
 jab arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa viraat rup dekha to uske mastak kaa visphoton hone laga
 'directo na jaane na labhe f shame' These same sentences of panic came out of his mouth and he prayed that the natural condition which God has placed for man is sufficient
 13wein adhyay main ek sidhaa vishay kshetra or kshetrajna kaa vichaar he
 This is the body area, the person who knows it is a field expert
 14wein adhyay kaa naam gunatray vibhaag yoga he
 This subject is a squeeze of all the Vedic, philosophical and mythological metaphysics — there are many interpretations of the three gunas — trios called sattva, raja, tam
 gunon kii samyavastha kaa naam pradhan yaa prakruti he
 a pathless creation is born from the contrast of qualities
 akelaa satv shant swabhaav se nirmal prakaash kii tarah sthir rahata he or akelaa tam bhi jadvat nishcesht rahata he
 But Rajoguna, who is in the middle of the two, drags them to the ground of Chesta
 gati tatv kaa naam hi rajas he
 The name of the 15th chapter is Purushottamayoga
 isamen vishwa kaa ashwatth ke rup main varnan kiya gaya he
 This ashwattha-like world is a great expansion
 desh or kaal main iskaa koi ant nahin he
 But the root or center of it, which is called the upward, is Brahm
 On the one hand, the ultimate glory, which gives rise to the cosmopolitan Ashwattha, is manifested in the form of the Sun and the Moon, on the other hand, it is in a Chaitanya center or Zoological
 Is in the body
 jaisaa gita main spasht kaha he-ahan vaishwanaro bhutva praninaan dehamashrith: 
 There is no more mystery than globalism or pranamayi consciousness
 nar yaa purush teen hai-kshar, akshar or avyay
 The name of the Panchabhutas is Kshar, the name of Prana is Akshar and the noun of Manastattva or Consciousness is indestructible
 inhen teen naron kii ekatra sthiti se maanvi chetana kaa janm hota he use hi rishiyon ne vaishwanar agni kaha he
 In the 16th chapter, the department of Dewasur property is described
 aarambh se hi rigdev main sristi kii kalpana daivi or asuri shaktiyon ke rup main kii gai he
 It is a fantasy of two forms of creation, one good and the other bad
 ek prakaash main, doosraa andhkaar main
 One nectar, the other mortal
 ek satya, doosraa anrut
 The noun of the 17th chapter is Shraddhatraya Vigyan Yoga
 iskaa sambandh sat, raj or tam, in teen gunon se hi he, arthath jisamen jis gun kaa pradurbhaav hota he, uski shraddha yaa jivan kii nishtha waisi hi ban jaati he
 Yagya, penance, charity, deeds are all conducted with three types of devotion
 yahan tak ki aahaar bhi teen prakaar kaa he
 The Gita has explained their differences and characteristics here
 18wein adhyay kii sangya mokshasanyas yoga he
 It contains a summary and epilogue of all the teachings of the Gita
 yahan pun: balpurvak maanav jivan ke liye teen gunon kaa mahatv kaha gaya he
 There is no one among the human beings of the earth and among the gods of heaven who is saved from these three qualities of nature
 manushya ko bahut dekh bhalkar chalanaa aavashyak he jisase vah apni buddhi or vritti ko buraai se bachaa sake or kya kaary he, kya acarya he, isko pahchaan sake
 The intellect which properly recognizes religion and unrighteousness, bondage and salvation, instinct and retirement, is the true wisdom and is the true achievement of man
 is prakaar bhagwaan ne jivan ke liye vyaavhaarik maarg kaa upadesh dekar ant main yah kaha he ki manushya ko chahie ki sansar ke sab vyavhaaron kaa sachai se paalan karte hue, jo akhand chaitanya tatv he, jise ishwar kehete hai, jo prayek praani ke hriddesh yaa centre main virajman he, usamen vishwaas rakhe, uskaa anubhav kare
 He is the entity's power, he is consciousness and he is the source of supreme bliss
 sanskrit sahitya kii parampara main un granthon ko bhashya, kehete hai jo duusare granthon ke arth kii vrihad vyakhya yaa tikaa prastut karte hai
 The Bhagavad Gita is also one of the three texts that had to clarify their perspective in order to establish any new philosophy or any new form of philosophy in the Indian philosophical tradition
 gita par anek achaaryon evam vidwaanon ne tikaayen kii hai
 Their short list according to sects is as follows: inke atirikt maharashtra sant gyandev yaa gyaneshwarkrut bhavarthadipika naam kii tikaa prasiddh he jo gita ke gyaan ko bhavatmak kavyastylee main prakat karti he
 In the present era, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilakkrit Geetarasya Tika, which was first introduced in 1915 with very detailed role and deliberation
 main puna se prakashit hui thi, gita sahitya main mahatvapurn sthaan rakhti he
 He has made such a diversion in bringing the original meaning of Gita to scholars, which was not possible till today after Shankaracharya
 vastut: shankaracharya kaa bhashya gita kaa mukhya arth gyanaprak karata he jabaki tilak ne gita ko karm kaa pratipadak shastr siddh kiya he
 Among all the languages available on the Bhagavad Gita, the element of Shri Jayadayal Goindka is the most popular and popular
 iskaa prakaashan gitapress ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Aaj Tak has sold 100 million copies
 shrimadbhagavadgita badalte saamaajik paridrishyon main apni mahatta ko banaae hue hai or isi kaaran takneekee vikaas ne isaki uplabdhta ko badhaayaa he, tathaa adhik bodhgamy banane kaa prayaas kiya he
 In the serial Mahabharata, aired on Doordarshan, Bhagavad Gita was a special attraction, while in the serial Sri Krishna, the Bhagwad Gita was highly researched and shown as a series of episodes
 isaki ek vishesh baat yah rahi ki gita se sambandhit saamaanya manushya ke sandehon ko arjuna ke prashnon ke madhyam se uttarit karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Apart from this, the serial gita-rahasya by Nitish Bhardwaj was completely focused on different dimensions of Gita itself
 internet par bhi aaj anekanek websiten is vishay par bahumadhyamon ke dwaara vishad jaankaree detii hai
 Shrimad Bhagwadgita is currently attracting attention of people not only in India but also abroad with her philosophical approach towards life more than religion
 nishkaam karm kaa gita kaa sandesh prabandhan guruon ko bhi lubhaa rahaa he
 It is included in the most famous books of all religions of the world
 gita press gorakhpur jaisi dharmik sahitya kii pustakon ko kaaphi kam mulya par uplabdh karaane vaale prakaashan ne bhi kai aakaar main arth or bhashya ke saath shrimadbhagavadgita ke prakaashan dwaara ise aam janata tak pahunchane main kaaphi yogadan diya he
 The teachings of the Gita are very ancient yoga
 shri bhagavan kehete hai ise maine sabase pehle surya se kaha tha
 The Sun is the symbol of knowledge, so the words of Shri God mean that even before the creation of the earth, i have given this knowledge to the devotees who have done many forms of research
 yah ishwariya vaani he jisamen sampoorn jivan kaa saar he evam aadhaar he
 Who am I? What is this body? Is my beginning and end with this body? Will i exist after my body renunciation? Where and in what form will this existence exist? What is the reason for me coming into the world? What will happen after leaving my body, where will i go? These things keep revolving in the heart of any curious person
 ham sadaa in baton ke bare main sochate hai or apane ko, apane swaroop ko nahin jaan pate
 In the Gita Shastra, the answers to all these questions have been readily given by Shri Bhagwan through religious dialogue
 is deh ko jisamen 36 tatv jeevatma kii upasthiti ke kaaran judakar kaary karte hai, kshetra kaha he or jeevatma is kshetra main nivas karata he, vahi is deh kaa swami he parantu ek teesraa purush bhi he, jab vah prakat hota he; adhidaiv arthath 36 tatwon vaale is deh ko or jeevatma kaa naash kar daalata he
 This perfect man is the ultimate state and ultimate truth
 yahi nahin, deh main sthit or deh tyagkar jate hue jeevatma kii gati kaa yatharth vaigyanik env tarksangat varnan gita shaastra main hua he
 The soul is eternal and the soul has attained the spirit of life
 sharir ke mar jane par jeevatma apane karmanusaar vibhinn yoniyon main vicharan karata he
 The Gita begins with the word Dharma and at the end of the eighteenth chapter of the Gita it is called Dharma Samvad
 dharm kaa arth he dhaaran karne vaala athwa jise dhaaran kiya gaya he
 The one who holds is called the soul and the one who holds it is nature
 aatma is sansar kaa beej arthath pita he or prakruti garbhadhaaran karne vaali yoni arthath mata he

 udhaaharan ke liye 19wein adhyay main karmvipak kaa ansh baad main joda gaya he
 Neither Muskari's commentary nor Hardatta's interpretation of it
 boudhayan dwaara uddhrut gautamadharmasutra ke vachan tathaa prastut dharmasutra ke aantarik sakshya par adhyay 6 kaa chatha sutara bhi parvarti prakshep prathit hota he
 It does not have interstitial footsteps like other Dharmasutras
 sampurna gautamadharmasutra gadhy main he, yadhyapi kuch sutara vattagandhistylee main likhe gaye hai or anushtup ke ansh prathit hote hai, anya dharmasutron kii apeksha isaki bhashaa panineey vyakaran kii adhik anuyaayini he, kintu yah sanskaar bhi baad kaa prathit hota he
 Since this Dharmasutra is a part of Samvidhana Brahmana and the Vashistha and Boudhayana Dharmasutras mention the names of this Dharmasutra, so it must have been composed after Samvidhamana Brahman and before Vasistha and Boudhayanadharmasutra
 is tathy tathaa buddha dharm ke dwaara kii gai varnashram dharm kii aalochana ke anullekh tathaa uski pratyaalochan ke abhaav ke aadhaar par is dharmasutra kaa rachanakaal 600-400 i
 purv mana gaya he
 To this is the "mitakshara" interpretation of Hardatta and the "commentary" of Muskari
 gautam dharmasutra ke rachiyata rishi gautam muni maane jate hai
 The mention of the name Gautama is found in many of the ancient scriptures
 yatha nyaay darshan ke praneta bhi akshapaad gautam maane jate hai
 In the Kathopanishad, Gautama is used for Nachiketa and his father Vajashravas
 isi prakaar chaandogya upanishad* main haridrum naam ke acharya kaa ullekh hua he
 The Atharvaveda * also has the name Gautama
 rugveda* ke rishi rahugan gautam hai
 Who among them practiced the Dharmasutra is uncertain
 charanvyuuh kii tikaa ke anusaar gautam samaveda kii ranayani shakha ke ek vibhaag ke acharya the
 * gautam dharmasutra main keval teen prashn hai
 There are nine chapters in the first and second questions and ten chapters in the third question
 is prakaar sampoorn gautam dharmasutra 28 adhyyon main vibhakt he, jisamen ek sahastra sutara he
 This book is only in prose and is the oldest among all the Dharmasutras
 is granth main vedon ke mantranshon ko sutara rup main uddhrut kiya gaya he
 Although the Yajurveda mantras are also cited in these sutras, the treatise of this text is believed to be related to the Samaveda, as it not only contains many themes of the Samaveda, but also the instructions of many suktas of the Samaveda
 saath hi is granth ke tritiy prashn ke ashtum adhyay main anek sutara samaveda ke samavidhan brahman se uddhrut he
 Similarly, in the twelfth sutra of the first chapter of the third question paper, there are directions of nine mantras of Samaveda
 pratham prashn ke pratham adhyay ke sutara 52wein tathaa tritiy prashn ke saptam adhyay ke 8wein sutara main paanch mahavyahritiyon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 These vyavritis are also related to the Samaveda
 in pramaanon ke aadhaar par gautam dharmasutra kaa sambandh samaveda se spasht he
 m m Kane has considered the relationship of Gautam Dharmasutra to Gautam Kalpa, but at the same time he has also given the opinion of its independent composition
 * From time to time, there are also projections in the Gautam Dharmasutra
 aisa praayah anek granthon ke saath hua he
 Gautam Dharmasutra is also no exception to this
 pramaan rup main kaha ja saktaa he ki boudhayan dharmasutra main gautam ke naam se yah mat uddhrut kiya gaya he ki brahman ko kshatriya kii vritti sweekaar nahin kerani chahie
 * But this opinion is not available in the present Gautama Dharmasutra, but instead it has been said that the Brahmin can also adopt Kshatriya and Vaishya instincts in emergency
 * isi prakaar vasishtha dharmasutra main bhi gautam ke naam se yah vichaar vyakt kiya gaya he ki yadi koi aahitagni yatra main mar jaae to uske sapind ghaas–phoos ke putale kaa punardaah karen, kintu vartmaan gautam dharmasutra main aisa koi sutara nahin he
 Many verses are also available in the Gautama Dharmasutra and in many manuscripts, an entire episode was added on Karmavipaka, which is not explained by Hardadatta
 in pramaanon ke aadhaar par vidwaanon kii dharna he ki gautam dharmasutra main samay samay par anek parivartan hote rahe hai
 Kundalal Sharma ji is of the view: - 'this type of recitation or projection was done before Kumaril because such discourses are discussed in the' Tantra Vartika '*
 mitakshra, smritichandrika tathaa anya granthon main uddhrut is rachana ke anek sutara vartmaan sanskarnon main uplabdh nahin hai
 ' gautam dharmasutra kaa kaal isa purv 400–600 ke pehle mana jaataa he
 It is for this concept that Gautama is mentioned in many texts
 jisase swatah siddh he ki gautam dharmasutra unase purvavarti he
 Similarly, other literature is also mentioned in Gautama Dharmasutra
 atah is sutaragranth ko us sahitya se parvarti hi maananaa hoga
 The two sides are as follows: gautam dharmasutra main kisi bhi dharmasutrakaar ke naam kaa ullekh praapt nahin hota, apitu 'ityeke', 'ekasham', 'eke' aadi shabdon ke dwaara hi apane se purvavarti aacharyon kaa ullekh isamen kiya gaya he
 In the Gautama Dharmasutra * a vote is given by the name of Manu
 * gautam dharmasutra kii vyakhya karte samay muscari ne apni vyakhya kii pushti main anek udhaaharan manusmriti se die hai
 Researchers have discovered more than 500 similarities in the terms of Gautam Dharmasutra Matha Manusmriti, even then it does not prove that the present Manusmriti is the main source of Gautam Dharmasutra
 * gautam dharmasutra* main ‘lokvedavedangvit’ kahkar veda–vedang tathaa* main ‘vakovaketihaaspuranakushalh’ kahkar puraana aadi kii charchaa bhi kii he
 Also, Upanishads - Vedanta etc
 are also mentioned in Gautama Dharmasutra *
 * isi prakaar 2–2–28 main nirukt* kii ore bhi sanket hai
 * On the basis of these evidences, Gautama Dharmasutra appears to be the latter of these texts
 boudhayan dharmasutra main do baar gautam kaa ullekh hua he
 * The Srautasutra Latyayana of Samaveda * and Drahayana * also cite Gautama
 samavedic gobhilgriysutra* bhi gautam dharmasutra ko pramanik maanata he
 Gautama is quoted in the Vasistha Dharmasutra *
 gautam dharmasutra kaa 19waan adhyay hi vasishtha dharmasutra main 22wein adhyay ke rup main he
 In Manusmriti * Gautama has been called the son of Utthya and in yajnavalkya-smriti * Gautama is counted in the scriptures
 shankaracharya ne veydantasutra–bhashya* main gautam dharmasutra* ko uddhrut kiya he
 * On the basis of these evidences, Gautama Dharmasutra stops after these compositions
 dow jolly gautam dharmasutra ko aapstamb dharmasutra se shatabdiyon purv maanate hai
 * M
 m Kane is of the view that Panini had no grammar at the time of Gautama Dharmasutra and if he had, he could not establish his importance
 nishkarsh swaroop gautam dharmasutra kaa rachana kaal 600 i
 pus
 main rakhaa ja saktaa he

 praayah sabhi dharmasutron kaa pratipaadya manushya ke vyaktigat tathaa saamaajik aachaar evam karttavya hai
 In Gautam Dharmasutra, a detailed discussion has been done regarding them
 anya dharmasutron ke samaan gautam dharmasutra main bhi mukhyatah varnon evam ashramon ke niyamon tathaa varnon ke dainik dharmakrityon kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he
 The Gautama Dharmasutra attaches utmost importance to the Varnashrama-system, even in it there is a prohibition of discourse with Varnashram, inferior and impure
 brahmacharee, grihasth, vaikhanas tathaa bhikshu ke rup main gautam ne manushya jivan ko chaar ashramon main vibhakt karke chaaron ashramavaasiyon ke karttavyon ke vistaar se ullekh kiya he
 Gautama gives importance to Grihastrashram, because all ashrams are dependent on it
 anya ashramon ke angrat bhikshu naam se sanyasashram ko gautam mahatvapurn maanate hai
 Vanaprastha or Vaikhanas is the link between householder and sannyasa
 gautam ne un sabhi ashramon ke karttavyadi ke vishay main vistaar se vichaar kiya he
 Gautam has given great importance to hospitality under the Ashram system
 gautam dharmasutra* ke anusaar sanyasi ko bhi atithi seva kerani chahie tathaa grihasth ko ‘devpitrumanushyarshipujak’ hona chahie
 Helping the grieving, patient, poor and student is the ultimate religion of the householder
 use atithi, balak, rogi, stri, vridhon, sevakon ko bhojan dekar swayan bhojan karnaa chahie
 Gautama has ordained five Mahayagya for the adherence to household religion
 * iske saath hi is dharm kii shuddhta ke liye anek niyam bhi banaae hai
 In the context of ashram-dharma, the Gautam Dharmasutra emphasizes on human qualities like mercy, forgiveness, self-reliance
 in gunon ke saath daan dene kaa vidhaan bhi yahan par kiya gaya he, kintu gautam dharmasutra* ke anusaar daan paatr kii yogyata ke anusaar dena chahie
 Gautama has a lot of emphasis on Satyabhashna and true conduct
 sabhi ke liye yah anivaary he
 That is why true speech has been called great penance
 satya bolne se swarg tathaa asaty bhaashan se narak prapti kii baat bhi kahi gai he
 With these qualities, a man should be non-violent, soft, tolerant, forgiving
 is prakaar gautam dharmasutra main vyaktigat tathaa saamaajik jivan ko shreshth banane kaa praytn kiya gaya he
 Along with this, Gautam also knows that a person due to his natural weakness tends to Kupath
 kabhi–kabhi puure samaaj main hi aniatikta vyaapt ho jaati he, kintu yadi ytn kiya jaae to ye durbalataayen der ho sakati hai
 Therefore, in the form of punishment in Gautam Dharmasutra many types of atonement have been constituted by which a person can be purified and lead a better life again
 is granth main kahin kahin maance–bhakshan kaa ullekh bhi miltaa he, kintu vah prakshipt prathit hota he
 In the Gautam Dharmasutra, along with the Ashram system, adequate light has also been thrown on the Varna system
 is prasang main brahman ko sarvopari sthaan pradaan kiya gaya he
 The duties and rights of the four varnas as Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra are well discussed here
 varna–vyavastha ke sucharu sanchalanarth yahan par savarna vivaah ko hi manyata pradaan kii gai he
 If someone marries asvarna, then his children will be called varnaskar
 yahan par yah bhi kaha gaya he ki nirantar saat pidiyon tak chalane vaali varnsankar santaan bhi apane apane kaaryon ke aadhaar par utkrisht varna yaa nishkrut varna kii ho jaati he
 Atonement, crime, punishment, death and birth annulment are also determined according to the varna
 sambhavtah brahman ko uski vidwata tathaa shreshth aacharan ke kaaran hi bandhanon se mukt rakhaa gaya hoga
 Therefore, in the Gautama Dharmasutra * it is said to be 'tadaktakstvadatti' gautam dharmasutra main shudron kii sthiti acchhee nahin dikhaai detii he
 Religious rites are not prescribed for them and only home labor is prescribed for them
 shudra kaa yahi dharm batalaaya gaya he ki vah ucch varna ke logon kii seva kare
 In Gautam Dharmasutra, the woman is given enough importance because she is the mother of children
 use shreshth acharya kaha gaya he
 Although he occupies a prestigious position as housewife and co-religionist in house related and religious works, yet he is called as an independent in the matter of religion
 kanya kaa vivaah mata–pita ke adheen he kintu yadi ve samay par kanya kaa vivaah nahin karte, to vah swayan anukool yuvak se vivaah kar sakati he
 Religious religion is mandatory for a woman
 apane pati ke atirikt use kisi or ke vishay main sochna bhi nahin chahie
 The strictest punishment for unethical sexual relations has been enacted
 gautam dharmasutra main daasi ke rup main nari kaa nimna swaroop hi drushtigochar hota he
 In one sutra *, it has even been said that if a maid is kept hostage with a man, he can consume it
 is kathan kaa auchity gautam dharmasutra ke tikaakar hardutt ne yah kahkar batalaaya he ki paas rakhi upbhogya vastu par koi vyakti kab tak sanyam rakh saktaa he? hardutt kaa yah kathan naitikta kii seemaa kaa ulanghan karata he
 Whatever the reason, this situation is indicative of inferiority of society
 gautam dharmasutra main rajya–vyavastha par bhi prakaash daalaa gaya he
 According to Gautam *, it is the duty of the king to protect the pranamatra and keep the subjects in the right place by punishing them justly
 raja vidwaan tathaa sadaachari brahman kii sahaayta se rajkaarya karata he
 The king is not autocratic in the Dharmasutras
 uske nyaay kii prakriya bhi jan–tantrik he
 In the state, the Brahmin is the one who rules the religion and the king is going to follow it
 * is prakaar gautam dharmasutra main ek bahut hi samanvaypurna lok–vyavastha kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 An attempt has been made here to give the right direction to the society by determining the duties of almost all kinds of different sections of the society so that the society can progress and people should grow in love, justice, mercy, benevolence etc
 sankshep main kaha jaae to gautam ne apane dharmasutra ke madhyam se sampoorn samaaj ko hi naitik evam saamaajik drushti se niyantrit karne kaa praytn kiya he
 Bhartriyajna - These are the ancient interpreters of the Gautama Dharmasutra which have been mentioned by many

 Lord Brahma, the four-headed, laughed happily and appeared in front of the inaccessible and said - 'may you be well! Ask for whatever wish you have in your mind
 ' brahmaji ke mukh se yah vaani sunakar durgam ne kaha – mujhe bal dijiye, jisase main devataaon ko parrast kar sakun
 Hearing this inaccessible, Brahma, the supreme commander of the four Vedas, went towards Satyaloka, saying 'so be it'

 kautilya kaa 'arthshaastra' raajnneetik siddhanton kii ek mahatvapurn kriti he
 In this connection, the question arises why Kautilya named his book 'arthashastra'? In ancient times the term 'arthashastra' was used in a broader sense
 iske antagart multah raajnneetishastra, dharamshastra, arthshaastra, kanoon aadi kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa tha
 In the view of Acharya Kautilya, political science is an independent science and its branches are investigation, trilogy and dialogue and law
 sampoorn samaaj kii raksha raajnneeti yaa dand vyavastha se hoti he yaa rakshit praja hi apane-apane karttavya kaa paalan kar sakati he
 At that time economics was considered the scripture of politics and administration
 mahabharat main is sambandh main ek prasang he, jisamen arjuna ko arthshaastra kaa visheshgy mana gaya he
 Certainly, Kautilya's Arthashastra would also have been taken as a form of Rajashastra, as he has given many interpretations of the meaning
 kautilya ne kaha he— manuyana vrutirarthah arthath manushyon kii jeevika ko 'arth' kehete hai
 Explaining the Arthashastra, he has said - Tasya Prithivya Gnanapalanopaya: Shastra marth-shastramiti
 is prakaar yah bhi spasht he ki 'arthshaastra' ke antargat rajvyavastha or arthvyavastha donon se sambandhit siddhanton kaa samavesh he
 In fact, it would not be appropriate to call Kautilya 'arthashastra' only a scripture of polity and economy
 vastav main, yah arthvyavastha, rajvyastha, vidhi vyavastha, samaaj vyavastha or dharm vyavastha se sambandhit shaastra he
 Many other Arthasastras were composed before Kautilya's 'arthashastra', although his manuscripts are not available
 bharat main pracheen kaal se hi arth, kaam or dharm ke sanyog or sammilan ke liye prayaas kiye jate rahe hai or uske liye shastron, smritiyon or puraanon main vishad charchaayen kii gayi hai
 Kautilya has also explained the meaning of 'arthashastra', measures of attainment of Artha, Kama and Dharma
 vatsyayan ke 'kamasutra' main bhi arth, dharm or kaam ke sambandh main sutron kii rachana kii gayi he
 Kautilya himself has also accepted the creation of his earlier economics
 apane 'arthshaastra' main kai sandarbhon main usne acharya brihaspati, bharadwaj, shukracharya, parashar, pishun, vishalaksh aadi aacharyon kaa ullekh kiya he
 Prior to Kautilya, the texts of many Acharyas are named as Dandaniti
 aisa prathit hota he ki kautilya ke purv shaastra dandniti kahe jate the or ve arthshaastra ke samroop hote the
 But as many scholars have admitted that both politics and economics are not identical
 you
 en
 ghoshaal ke kathananusaar arthshaastra zyada vyapak shaastra he, jabaki dandniti maatr uski shakha he
 The scriptures written after Kautilya became known as 'niti Shastra', like Kamandaka Niti'sar
 vaise kai vidwaanon ne arthshaastra ko nitishastra kii apeksha zyada vyapak mana he
 However, in the opinion of most scholars, both ethics and economics are similar and both have the same subject area
 swayan kaamandak ne nitishastra or arthshaastra ko samroop mana he
 It is clear from the above discussion that scriptures like 'arthashastra' were composed before and after Kautilya's 'arthashastra'
 is sambandh main aise vidwaanon kii acchhee-khaasi sankhya he jo yah maanate hai ki kautilya 'arthshaastra' kaa rachanaakaar nahin tha
 The number of Western scholars is more among such scholars
 sten, jolly, winternij va kith is prakaar ke vichaar ke pratipadak hai
 Indian scholar R
 G
 Bhandarkar has also supported this
 bhandarkar ne kaha he ki patanjali ne mahabhashya main kautilya kaa ullekh nahin kiya he
 Those who did not recognize Kautilya as the author of 'arthashastra', have presented the following arguments in support of their view- pustak kii samaapti par spasht rup se likhaa gaya he- It has also been written: vishnu puraana main is ghatana kii charchaa is tarah kii gai he: Confirming the incident, Kamantak, the doer of 'nitisara', wrote: in uddharanon se spasht he ki vishnugupt or kautilya ek hi vyakti the
 In the 'arthashastra' itself, at the end of the tenth chapter of the second tribunal, the name of the author of the book is named 'kautilya': pustak ke armbh main ‘kautilyon kruthan shastram’ tathaa prayek adhyay ke ant main ‘iti kautilierthshastre’ likhakar granthkaar ne apane ‘kautilya naam ko adhik vikhyath kiya he
 Wherever the opinion of other Acharyas has been expressed, in the end there is 'iti Kautilya' i
e
 Kautilya's opinion - saying thus has shown more favor to the name Kautilya
 parantu yah sarvatha nirvivaad he ki vishnugupt tathaa kautilya abhinn vyakti the
 If the later Dandi poet called it Acharya Vishnugupta, Banabhatta called it Kautilya
 donon kaa kathan he ki is acharya ne ‘dandniti’ athwa ‘arthshaastra’ kii rachana kii
 In the Panchatantra, the name of this Acharya has been given as Chanakya, the author of economics
 kavi vishakhdutt-pranit suprasiddh naatak ‘mudrarakshas’ main chanakya ko kabhi kautilya tathaa kabhi vishnugupt naam se sambodhit kiya gaya he
 'arthashastra' was created for the first Mauryan emperor Chandragupta as a 'rule of law'
 at: isaki rachana kaa kaal vahi maananaa uchit he, jo samraat chandragupta kaa kaal he
 Archaeological scholars dated this period to 321 BC
 From 296 BC Till sure
 kai anya vidwaan samraat cendrakotus ke aadhaar par nishchit kii hui is tithi ko sweekaar nahin karte
 Sukhya Moolam Dharma: dharmasy mulan arthh
 Meaning states
 rajyasy mulan indriya jayah
 Indriyajasya Moolam Vinayah
 vinayasy mulan vridhopaseva
sukh kaa mul he, dharm
 Meaning of religion is Artha
 arth kaa mul he, rajya
 The root of the kingdom is victory over the senses
 indriyajay kaa mul he, vinay
 The core of Vinay is service to the aged
 jaise upar kaha gaya he, iskaa mukhya vishay shashan-vidhi athwa shashan-vigyaan he: ‘‘kautilyon narendrarthey shashansy vidhi: krit:
 "it is clear from these words that Acharya composed it as a method of political science and especially governance
 arthshaastra kii vishay-suchi ko dekhne se yah sarvatha pramanit ho jaataa he ki ise aajkal kahe jane vaale arthshaastra kii pustak kahana bhul he
 At the beginning of the first tribunal itself, Acharya himself has informed it by the name 'dandaniti'
 shukracharya ne dandniti ko itani mahatvapurn vidya batalaaya he ki isamen anya sab vidyaon kaa antarbhaav maan liya he- kyonki 'shastren rakshite deshe shastrachintaa pravartate' kii ukti ke anusaar shastr dwaara sushasit tathaa surakshit desh main hi veda aadi anya shastron kii chintaa yaa anushilan ho saktaa he
 Therefore , it is necessary to accept penalism as the basic discipline of all other disciplines, and the same punishment is economics
 jise aajkal arthshaastra kaha jaataa he, uske liye 'vaarta' shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya he, yadhyapi yah shabd purnataya arthshaastra kaa dyotak nahin
 Kautilya has said three parts of the dialogue - agriculture, commerce and animal husbandry, from which often the profession or livelihood was earned
 manu, yajyavlky aadi shaastrakaron ne bhi in teen angon vaale vaartashastra ko sweekaar kiya he
 Shukracharya has also included Kusid in this dialogue as a means of instinct
 parantu arthshaastra ko sabhi shaastrakaron ne dandniti, raajnneeti athwa shashanvigyaan ke rup main hi varnit kiya he
 Therefore, it would be better to consider 'kautilya Arthashastra' as a book of politics and not a book of wealth
 vaise isamen kahin-kahin sampattishastra ke dhanotpaadan, dhanopbhog tathaa dhan-vinimay, dhan-vibhaajan aadi vishyon kii bhi praasangik charchaa kii gai he
 The opening verse of the first tribunal of 'kautilya Arthashastra' is going to throw more light in this regard: arthath-pracheen aacharyon ne prithvi jeetne or paalan ke upaay batalaane vaale jitne arthshaastra likhe hai, praayah un sabakaa saar lekar is ek arthshaastra kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 Where this quote explains the subject of economics, it also illuminates the truth that before the 'kautilya Arthashastra', many masters composed the Arthashastra, which was intended to propose measures for conquering the earth and its observance
 un aacharyon tathaa unke sampradaayon ke kuch naamon kaa nirdesan ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ main kiya gaya he, yadhyapi unki kritiyaan aaj uplabdh bhi nahin hotin
 This name is the following: arthshaastra ke in das sampradaayon ke aacharyon main praaia: sabhi ke sambandh main kuch-na-kuch gyaat he, parantu vishalaksh ke bare main bahut kam parichay praapt hota he
 It is very clear from these names that many great thinkers and philosophers got attention towards economics ethics and a bright literature was produced on this subject
 aaj vah sahitya lupt ho chukaa he
 Due to many foreign invasions and state revolutions, this literature has remained nameless, but whatever literature is residual indicates a wide economical tradition
 is arthshaastra main ek aisi shashan-paddati kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he jisamen raja yaa shaasha praja kaa kalyaan sampaadan karne ke liye shashan karata he
 The king cannot rule arbitrarily
 use mantriparishad kii sahaayta praapt karke hi praja par shashan karnaa hota he
 The state-priest is like a curse on the king, who can control the king if he is disinherited from the religious path and can force him to perform his duty
 sarvalokahitkaari raashtra kaa jo swaroop kautilya ko abhipret he, vah ‘arthshaastra’ ke nimnlikhit vachan se spasht he- That is, the happiness of the king is in the happiness of the people, it is in the interest of the people
 raja kaa apana priy kuch nahin he, praja kaa priy hi uskaa priy he
 Around 400 CE, Kamandaka wrote an Arthashastra based on Kautilya's Arthashastra, a poetic form divided into 20 cantos called Kamandikeya Nitisara
 yah naitikta or videsh-niti ke siddhanton par bhi vichaar karata he
 The ethics of Somdev Suri, the short economics of Hemachandra, the Yuktikalpataru of Bhoja, the Venus of Venus, etc
 are some other well-known economics, which can also be counted under texts explaining the practical side of ethics
 chanakyanitidarpan, nitishalokon kaa avyavasthit sangrah he

9563 Varanasi) is a famous city in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh
 ise 'banaras' or 'kaashi' bhi kehete hai
 It is considered to be one of the most sacred cities in Hinduism and is known as the non-free Zone
 iske alaava buddha evam jain dharm main bhi ise pavitra mana jaataa he
 It is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world and the oldest inhabited city in India
 kaashi naresh varanasi shahar ke mukhya saanskrithik sangrakshak evam sabhi dharmik kriya-kalapon ke abhinn ang hai
 The culture of Varanasi is inextricably linked to the river Ganges and its religious significance
 ye shahar sahasron varshon se bharat kaa, visheshkar uttar bharat kaa saanskrithik evam dharmik kendra rahaa he
 The Banaras Gharana of Hindustani classical music was born and developed in Varanasi itself
 bharat ke kai darshanik, kavi, lekhak, sangitajna varanasi main rahe hai, jinamein kabir, vallabhacharya, ravidaas, swami ramanand, trailang swami, shivanand goswami, munshi premchand, jaishankar prasad, acharya ramchandra shukla, pandit ravi shankar, girija devi, pandit hari prasad chaurasia evam ustad bismillah khan aadi kuch hai
 Goswami Tulsidas wrote Ramcharitmanas, the most revered book of Hinduism here, and Gautam Buddha gave his first sermon here in Sarnath
 varanasi main chaar bade vishvavidhyalay sthit hai: banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay, mahatma gandhi kaashi viapeeth, central institute of hyer tibetian studies or sampoornanand sanskrit vishvavidhyalay
 The residents here mainly speak Kashika Bhojpuri, which is a dialect of Hindi
 varanasi ko praayah 'mandiron kaa shahar', 'bharat kii dharmik rajdhani', 'bhagwaan shiv kii nagari', 'deepon kaa shahar', 'gyaan nagari' aadi visheshnon se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 Eminent American writer Mark Twain writes: "benaras is more ancient than history, older than traditions, older than legends and, when collected, is twice as old as that collection
 " The name Varanasi probably originates from the name of two local rivers, the Varuna River and the Asi River
 ye nadiyaan ganga nadi main kramshah uttar evam dakshin se aakar milti hai
 Another idea of the name comes from the name of the river Varuna, which may have been called Varanasi in ancient times and this is how the city got its name
 iske samarthan main shaayad kuch aarambhik paath uplabdh hon, kintu is duusare vichaar ko itihaasavetta sahi nahin maanate hai
 For a long time, Varanasi has also been referred to as the non-liberated region, anand-kanan, Mahashmshan, Surandhan, Brahmavart, Sudarshan, Ramya, and Kashi
 rugveda main shahar ko kaashi yaa kasi naam se bulaayaa gaya he
 It is derived from the word published, which refers to the historical level of the city, as the city has always been the center of knowledge, education and culture
 kaashi shabd sabase pehle atharvaveda kii papplad shakha se aayaa he or iske baad shatapath main bhi ullekh he
 But it is possible that the name of the city is old in the district
 skanda puraana ke kaashi khand main nagar kii mahima 15,000 shlokon main kahi gayi he
 In a verse, Lord Shiva says: teenon lokon se samahit ek shahar he, jisamen sthit meraa nivas prasaad he kaashi Another reference to Varanasi is given by sage Ved Vyas in another prose: ganga tarang romantic jatkalapnaam, gauri nirantar vibhooshit vambhagam
narayanprium anang madapaaaram, varanasipur patim bhaj vishwanatham The name of the river Varanavati has appeared in the Atharvaveda, which is most likely used for the modern Varuna river itself
 assi nadi ko puraanon main asisambhed tirth kaha he
 The Kashi section of Skanda Purana states that all the pilgrimages of the world together do not equal the sixteenth part of the Asisambheda
 agnipurana main asi nadi ko vyutpann kar nasi bhi kaha gaya he
 If we step down the river Varanasi, a river named Nasi has been removed, which later changed to the name Asi
 mahabharat main varuna yaa aadhunik barna nadi kaa pracheen naam varnasi hone kii pushti hoti he
 Hence, the word Varanasi is formed after the name of two rivers
 padam puraana ke kaashi mahatmaya, khand-3 main bhi shloke he: Varanasi City Familiarity Tanaman Nigam and: north-east jaruvi pashchimetrapi pashpanirganeshvar:
 
 matsay puraana main shiv varanasi kaa varnan karte hue kehete hai - Varanasayam River Pu Siddhagandharveshvita
 pravishta tripatha ganga tasmin kshetre mam priye
 Eighty is not mentioned here
 varanasi kshetra kaa vistaar bataate hue matsay puraana main ek or jagah kaha gaya he- Varna Ch River Yavadivachushkhanadi and
 bhismayandikmarmbh parvateshwarmanti ke
 It is known from the above quotes that the city was actually named after settling on Varanasi
 assi or varuna ke bich main varanasi ke basane kii kalpana us samay se udai hui jab nagar kii dharmik mahima badi or uske saath-saath nagar ke dakshin main aabaadi badhane se dakshin kaa bhaag bhi uski seemaa main aa gaya
 By the way, the word Varana is also the name of a tree
 prachinkaal main vrikshon ke naam par bhi nagaron ke naam padate the jaise koshamb se kaushambi, rohit se rohitak ityadi
 Therefore, it is possible that both Varanasi and Varanavati got their name only from this particular tree
 varanasi naam ke uparokt kaaran se yah anumaan kadaapi nahin lagaana chaiye ki is nagar ke se ukt vivechan se yah na samaj lenaa chahie ki kaashi rajya ke is rajdhani shahar kaa keval ek hi naam tha
 Many names are found in Buddhist literature alone
 udai jataka main surrundan, sutasom jataka main sudarshan, somdand jataka main brahmavardhan, khandhhal jataka main pushpavati, yuvanjay jataka main ramm nagar, shankh jataka main molino naam aate hai
 It was also known as Kasinagar and Kasipur
 samraat ashok ke samay main isaki rajdhani kaa naam potli tha
 It cannot be said with certainty that all these names were from the same city, or the names of more than one capitals of different times of the Kashi kingdom
 puranic kathaon ke anusaar, kaashi nagar kii sthapana hindu bhagwaan shiv ne lagbhag 5000 varsh purv kii thi, jis kaaran ye aaj ek mahatvapurn tirth sthal he
 It is one of the holy Saptapuris of Hindus
 skanda puraana, ramayana, mahabharat evam pracheenatam veda rugveda sahit kai hindu granthon main is nagar kaa ullekh aata he
 Generally, Varanasi city is considered to be around 3000 years old
 , parantu hindu paramparaon ke anusaar kaashi ko isse bhi atyant pracheen mana jaataa he
 The city has been a commercial and industrial center for muslin and silk fabrics, perfumes, ivory and crafts
 gautam buddha ke kaal main, varanasi kaashi rajya kii rajdhani hua karata tha
 Renowned Chinese traveler Xuan Tsang has described the city as a center for religious, educational and artistic activities and has written an extension of 5 km on the banks of the Ganges River
 kaashi main pracheen kaal se samay samay par anek mahaan vibhootiyon kaa pradurbhaav yaa vaas hota rahaa hai
 Some of these are as follows: varanasi 18veen shatabdi main swatantra kaashi rajya ban gaya tha or baad ke british shashan ke adheen, ye pramukh vyapaarik or dharmik kendra rahaa
 In 1910, the British administration made Varanasi a new Indian state and made Ramnagar its headquarters, but it had no jurisdiction
 kaashi naresh abhi bhi ramnagar kile main rahete hai
 This fort is situated on the banks of the Ganges in the east of Varanasi city
 ramnagar kile kaa nirmaan kaashi naresh raja balavant singh ne uttam chunaar balua pathar ne 18veen shatabdi main karavaaya tha
 The fort is built in the Mughal architectural style with carved balconies, open courtyards and picturesque domed pavilions
 kaashi naresh kaa ek anya mahal chait singh mahal he
 It was built by Maharaja Chait Singh near Shivala Ghat
 ramnagar kila or iskaa sangrahalay ab banaras ke raajaaon kii aitihaasik dharohar rup main sangrakshit hai or 18veen shatabdi se kaashi naresh kaa aadhikarik awaas rahe hai
 Even today, the people of Kashi Naresh Nagar are respected
 ye nagar ke dharmik adhyaksh maane jate hai or yahaan ke log inhen bhagwaan shiv kaa avatar maanate hai
 Naresh has been the chief cultural patron of the city and an integral part of all major religious activities
 varanasi shahar kaa bada ansh atiprachinkaal se kaashi kaha jaataa he
 It is considered to be the biggest pilgrimage in Hindu belief, but the earliest mention of Varanasi as a pilgrimage is found in Mahabharata
 mahabharat-purv ke kisi sahitya main kisi bhi tirth aadi ke bare main koi ullekh nahin he
 Today's pilgrimage centers were mostly forested and devoid of humans
 kahin-kahin adivaasiyon kaa vaas rahaa hoga
 Later, the stories told about the pilgrimage came into existence and the pilgrimage grew, around which the city and city also resided
 bharatbhumi main aaryon ke prasar ke dwaara tirthon ke astitv tathaa mahatmay kaa pataa chalaa
 It is mentioned in Mahabharata that some places of the earth are sacred and sacred
 inamen se koi to sthaan kii vichitrataa ke kaaran koi janm ke prabhaav or koi rishi-muniyon ke sampark se pavitra ho gaya he
 An important description about Kashi comes in the Yajurvedic Jabaal Upanishad, but modern scholars do not consider this Upanishad as ancient
 jabal-upanishad khand-2 main maharishi atri ne maharishi yajyavlky se avyakt or anant paramatma ko jaanane kaa tarika poocha
 Then Yajnavalkya said that that latent and eternal soul can be worshiped in the free zone, because it is right there
 or atri ke avimukt kii sthiti poochne par
 Yajnavalkya replied that he was in the middle of the rivers Varana and Nashi
 vah varna kya he or vah nashi kya he, yah poochne par uttar mila ki indriya-krit sabhi dosha kaa nivaaran karne vaali varna he or indriya-krit sabhi paapon kaa naash karne vaali nashi he
 He is the deity place of the deity free and the Brahma Sadan of all beings
 vahaan hi praaniyon ke praan-prayaag ke samay main bhagwaan rudra tarak mantra kaa upadesh dete he jiske prabhaav se vah amriti hokar moksh praapt karata he
 Therefore, one should always reside in the free and the free
 usko kabhi na chode, aisa yajyavlky ne kaha he
 Apart from the Jabalopinashad, Kashi has also been mentioned in many memories such as Likhtamriti, Shringamismriti and Parasharsmriti, Brahmi Singhhita and Santkumarasamhita
 praayah sabhi puraanon main kaashi kaa mahatmaya kaha gaya he
 In Brahmavaivarta Purana, there is only a full text on the Kashi area called kashi-rahasya, which is called its bloom
 padam puraana main kaashi-mahatmaya or anya sthanon par bhi kaashi kaa ullekh aata he
 Sixteen chapters in the ancient Linga Purana were in connection with the pilgrimages of Kashi
 varttman lingapurana main bhi ek adhyay he
 The Kashi Khand of Skanda Purana discusses and describes in detail the holy form of Kashi
 is prakaar puraana-sahitya main kaashi ke dharmik mahatmaya par saamagree he
 Apart from this, Kashi is also mentioned in sanskrit-vadmay, Daskumarcharit, Naishadh, Rajatarangini and Kuttanipatam
 12veen shatabdi isvi tak praapt hone vaale ling puraana main tisare se attharahawein adhyay tak kaashi ke devaytanon tathaa tirthen kaa vistrut varnan tha
 The Lingapurana was the same in the composition of the Tristhalisetu Granth
 arthath lingapurana main bhi tisare se solahaven adhyay tak lingo kaa varnan kiya he
 In the present Linga Purana, only one chapter is about Kashi, which contains only 144 verses
 is prakaar mahabharat ke alaava yadi sabhi puraanon ke ullekh dekhen, to kaashi ke tirth rup ke ullekh kii suchi bahut lambii banati he
 There are 264 pilgrimages mentioned in the word Kalkalpadrum, but in the idea of glory, the names of Char Dham and Saptapuris are considered at the top among the pilgrimages of India
 prayag, gaya or gangasagar tak ke naam inamen nahin aate
 Therefore, it can also be ruled out
 varanasi kshetra ke vistaar ke anek puranic uddhran uplabdh hai
 According to the pilgrimage discussion and other ancient texts given in Karyakalpataru: uparokt uddharanon se gyaat hota he ki pracheen varanasi kaa vistaar kaaphi dur tak tha
 The fort of Rajghat west of Varuna where ancient Varanasi is no doubt inhabited is a mile long and 400 yards wide
 ganga nadi uske dakshin-purv mukh kii raksha karti he or varuna nadi uttar or uttar-purv mukhon kii raksha ek chhichhli khai ke rup main karti he, pashchim kii ore ek khaali naala he jisamen se hokar kisi samay varuna nadi bahati thi
 Given this natural means of defense, perhaps in ancient times this place was chosen for the city of Varanasi
 san 1857 i
 ke pratham bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke samay angrejon ne bhi nagar raksha ke liye varuna ke peeche oonchi jameen par kachi mitti kii deevaaren uthaakar kilebandi kii thi
 The limit of Varanasi in the Puranas is much more than the length and breadth of Rajghat
 un varnanon se lagata he ki vahaan keval nagar kii seemaa hi nahin varnit he, balki puure kshetra ko sammilit kar liya gaya he
 The remains of ancient settlements are found far to the far side of Varuna
 atah sambhav he ki puraanon main mili varnan ve sab bhaag bhi aa gayi hon
 If we consider this area to be connected to the city, then the length and breadth of the city described in the Puranas is almost right
 gautam buddha ke janm purv mahajanapad yug main varanasi kaashi janapad kii rajdhani thi
 But it is difficult to estimate accurately about the expansion of ancient Kashi district
 jaatakon main kaashi kaa vistaar 300 yojan diya gaya he
 In the north of Kashi district was Kosal district, Magadha district in the east and Vatsa in the west
 itihaasavetta dow oltekar ke matanusaar kaashi janapad kaa vistaar uttar-pashchim kii ore 250 mile tak tha, kyonki iskaa purv kaa padosi janapad magadh or uttar-pashchim kaa padosi janapad uttar paanchal tha
 According to the Jataka, the boundaries of Kashi and Kosal were mixed
 kaashi kii dakshin seemaa kaa sahi varnan uplabdh nahin he, shaayad isaliye ki vah vindhyas shrinkhalaa tak gai hui thi va aage koi aabaadi nahin thi
 On the basis of the natives, the expansion of Kashi must have been extending from present Ballia to Kanpur
 yahaan shri rahul sankrutyaayan kehete hai, ki aadhunik banaras kamishnari hi pracheen kaashi janapad rahaa tha
 It is possible that some part of modern Gorakhpur Commissionerate has been included in Kashi district
 puru kul ke raja divodas dwaara duusari varanasi kii sthapana kaa ullekh mahabharat or anya granthon main aata he
 There is also a possibility of this city being in the baraunt
 is bare main pandit kubernath sukul ke anusaar bairaat khandhar baan ganga ke dakshin kinare par he vam par nahin
 In this way the stream of Ganges between Gomti and Bairant becomes a barrier
 ganga ke raste badalane, baan ganga main ganga ke bahane or ganga-gomti sangam saidpur ke paas hone ke bare main aage sukulaji ne mahabharat ke hawaale se bataaya he ki ganga-gomti sangam par markendeya tirth tha, jo vartmaan main kathi ke sameep sthit he
 Therefore, it can be said that if the ganga-gomti confluence was near Saidpur then it may have been pre-mahabharata and not after the third century AD
 varanasi shahar uttari bharat kii madhya ganga ghati main, bhartiya rajya uttar pradesh ke purvi chor par ganga nadi ke baayin ore ke vakrakaar tat par sthit he
 The headquarters of Varanasi district is also located here
