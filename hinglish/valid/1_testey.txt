 That couplet is as follows- dev ne kai ashrayadaataaon ke yahan rahakar apni rachanaayen kin
 His 'ashtayam' was written at the behest of Aurangzeb's son Azam Shah and he also rewarded him
 sambhavat: 'bhavvilas' bhi aajamshah ke aashray main likhaa gaya ho

 dev kii rachanaaon main jitna vyapak anubhav miltaa he utani hi gahari bhavukta bhi praapt hoti he
 The living and touching description of any emotion like a god is an extraordinary thing
 dev kii kalpana keval oohatmak visheshta hi nahin rakhti, varan vah anubhuti ke ras se sinchit hokar sarasata sampann hoti he
 Similarly, the terminology of Dev is also his own
 dev kii shabdaawalee main sangitamay pravahyukt shabdachayan, chand ko sahaj smaraneey bana detaa he or rup, saundarya, vastu, charitra ke chithran main dev ko apratim safalataa praapt hui he
 Dev has acquired an extremely outstanding position in Hindi literature due to these characteristics, although he did not receive the contemporary state honor as he should have

 Gandhiji did both the British Raj and the reactionary attitude by Indians
 unhone british nagarikon tathaa dangon ke shikaar logon ke prati samvednaa vyakt kii tathaa party ke aarambhik virodh ke baad dangon kii bhartsana kii
 After Gandhi's emotional speech, he advocated his theory that all violence and evil cannot be justified

 Without Gandhiji's unified personality, the Indian National Congress began to split into two parties during his two years in prison, one party led by Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru, who favored the party's participation in the House
 The leadership was led by Chakravarti Rajagopalacharya and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel

 In December 1928, Gandhiji made a motion in a session of the Congress held in Calcutta asking him to give power to the Indian Empire or face the non-cooperation Movement for the independence of the entire country as his motive for not doing so

 As a result of this agreement, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference to be held in London as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress

 In addition, Lord Willington, the successor of Lord Irwin, began a new campaign to control and crush the movement of nationalists

 In protest against this, Gandhiji took a six-day hunger strike in September 1932, which forced the government to successfully adopt a similar system of mediation by Palvankar Balu, a Dalit-turned-political leader
 achhuton ke jivan ko sudhaarney ke liye gandhi ji dwaara chalaae gaye is abhiyaan kii shuruuaat thi
 Gandhiji named these untouchables as Harijans whom they considered to be children of God
 8 may 1933 ko gandhi ji ne harijan andolan main madad karne ke liye aatm shuddhikaran kaa 21 din tak chalane vaala upwas kiya
 This new campaign was not liked by the Dalits however he remained a prominent leader

 Ambedkar and his allies also felt that Gandhiji was undermining the political rights of Dalits
 haalanki gandhi ji ek vaisya jati main paidaa hue phir bhi unhonen is baat par jor diya ki vah dow ambedkar jaise dalit masiha ke hote hue bhi vah daliton ke liye aawaaj uthaa saktaa he
 Untouchability was a major evil in the social evils of India during the Indian freedom struggle, against which Mahatma Gandhi and his followers struggled

 The trustees of the temple were told that the first day of the new year, that is, January 1, 1934, would be celebrated as the last decision day and that in the event of no determination from their level on this date, the activists by Mahatma Gandhi and Mr
 Kelappan Fasting can be done in favor of is kaaran guruvayur mandir ke trusteo kii ore se baithak bulaakar mandir ke upasko kii raay bhi praapt kii gayi
 In the meeting, on the basis of majority given by 77 percent of the devotees, the entry of Harijans into the temple was approved and thus the entry of Harijans as a success of the determination day in Sri Guruvayur temple in Kerala from 1 January 1934, in principle Got approval
 guruvayur mandir jisamen aaj bhi gaiyr hinduon kaa pravesh varjit he tathaapi kai dharmon ko maanane vaale bhagwaan bhagwaan guruvayurappan ke param bhakt hai

 Gandhi, while leading a party for Raj, did not want to prove any goal by campaigning which would be accepted as a political arrangement with Raj temporarily
 gandhi ji nehru presidensi or congress ke lahore adhiveshan ke saath hi 1936 main bharat laut aae
 However, Gandhi wished to focus his full attention on achieving independence and not on speculation about India's future
 usne congress ko samaajwaad ko apane uddeshy ke rup main apnaane se nahin roka
 Gandhi had differences with Subhash Bose, who was elected to the presidency in 1938
 bose ke saath matbhedon main gandhi ke mukhya bindu bose kii loktantr main patibaddhta kii kami tathaa ahimsa main vishwaas kii kami thi
 Bose won for the second time in spite of Gandhi's criticism, but left the Congress when all Indian leaders abandoned all the principles implemented by Gandhiji

 As the war progressed Gandhiji intensified his demand for independence by giving the British the Quit India Movement
 yah gandhi tathaa congress party kaa sarvaadhik spasht vidroh tha jo bhartiya seemaa se angrejon ko khadedane par lakshith tha
 Jawaharlal Nehru's party, sitting second to Gandhiji, was criticized by some members of the party and by some other political Indian parties who believed in both the British and the opposition
 kuch kaa maananaa tha ki apane jivan kaal main athwa maut ke sangharsh main angrejon kaa virodh karnaa ek nashwar kaary he jabaki kuch maanate the ki gandhi ji paryaapt koshish nahin kar rahe hai
 Quit India became the most powerful movement of this struggle which led to widespread violence and arrest
 police kii goliyon se hajaaron kii sankhya main swatantraaa senaanee yaa to maare gaye yaa ghayal ho gaye or hajaaron giraftaar kar liye gaye
 Gandhi and his supporters made it clear that he would not support the war effort unless India was granted immediate independence
 unhone spasht kiya ki is baar bhi yah aandolan band nahin hoga yadi hinsa ke vyaktigat krityon ko moort rup diya jaataa he
 He said that the order of chaos around him is worse than real anarchy

 Gandhiji and all members of the Congress Working Committee were arrested by the British on 9 August 1942 in Mumbai
 gandhi ji ko pune ke anga khan mahal main do saal tak bandi banaakar rakhaa gaya
 This was the time when Gandhiji suffered two deep blows in his personal life
 unka 50 saal purana sachiv mahadev desai 6 din baad hi dil kaa daura padane se mar gaye or gandhi ji ke 18 maheene jail main rahane ke baad 22 farvari 1944 ko unki patni kasturba gandhi kaa dehanth ho gaya
 Six weeks later, Gandhiji also suffered from severe malaria
 unke kharaab swasthya or jaruri upachaar ke kaaran 6 may 1944 ko yuddh kii samaapti se purv hi unhen reeha kar diya gaya
 Raj did not want to see him dying in jail which would increase the anger of the country

 At the end of the war, the British gave a clear indication that the Santha would be transferred and handed over to the Indians
 is samay gandhi ji ne andolan ko band kar diya jisase congressi netaaon sahit lagbhag 100,000 rajnatik bandiyon ko reeha kar diya gaya
 In 1946, Gandhiji advised the Congress to reject the proposal of the British kbnet Mission as he was deeply skeptical of the proposed grouping for Muslim dominated provinces, hence Gandhi viewed the episode as a rehearsal of a partition
 haalanki kuch samay se gandhi ji ke saath congress dwaara matbhedon vaali ghatana main se yah bhi ek ghatana bani chunki nehru or patel jaanate the ki yadi congress is yojana kaa anumodan nahin karti he tab sarkaar kaa niyantran muslim lig ke paas chalaa jayega
 Between 1948, over 5000 people were killed during the violence
 gandhi ji kisi bhi aisi yojana ke khilaaf the jo bharat ko do alag alag deshon main vibhajit kar de
 The overwhelming majority of many Hindus and Sikhs and Muslims living in India were in favor of the partition of the country
 iske atirikt mohammad ali jinna, muslim lig ke netaa ne, pashchim punjab, sindh, uttar pashchim seemaant praant or purvi bengal main vyapak sahyog kaa parichay diya
 In order to stop the widespread hindu-muslim fighting, Congress leaders gave their approval to this plan of partition

 Close associates of Gandhiji accepted Partition as the best solution and Sardar Patel tried to convince Gandhiji that this was the only way to prevent a war with civil unrest
 majboor gandhi ne apni anumati de di
 He held intense discussions with leaders of Muslim and Hindu communities in North India as well as Bengal to calm the warm attitude

 He started his first fast-unto-death in Delhi asking for immediate end to communal violence for all and to pay Rs 55 crore to Pakistan
 gandhi ji ko dar tha ki pakistan main asthirataa or asuraksha se bharat ke prati unka gussa or bad jayega tathaa seemaa par hinsa fail jaaegi
 He further feared that Hindus and Muslims would renew their enmity again and that there could be a possibility of a civil war
 jivan bhar gandhi ja kaa saath dene vaale sahyogiyon ke saath bhavuk bahes ke baad gandhi ji ne baat kaa maanane se inkaar kar diya or sarkaar ko apni niti par adig rahanaa padaa tathaa pakistan ko bhugtan kar diya
 The leaders of Hindu Muslim and Sikh community assured them that they would forget peace and bring peace

 In line with these ideas, in 1940, when the invasions by Nazi Germany on the British islands appeared imminent, Gandhiji asked the British to follow the following policy of non-violence in peace and war

 gandhi ji ne landan main rahete samay or uske baad shaakaahaari bhojan kii vakaalat karne main kaaphi samay bitaayaa
 Gandhiji said that vegetarian food not only fulfills the needs of the body but it also serves the economic purpose which is made of meat and yet meat is more expensive than grains, vegetables and fruits
 iske alaava kai bhartiya jo aay kam hone kii vajah se sangharsh kar rahe the, us samay jo shaakaahaari ke rup main dikhaai de rahe the vah aadhyatmik parampara hi nahin vyaavhaarikta ke kaaran bhi tha

 This decision was completely influenced by the philosophy of Brahmacharya
 Spiritual and practical purity is largely associated with celibacy and disinterestedness
 Gandhi saw celibacy as the primary basis for getting closer to God and identifying himself in his autobiography
 The childhood bride tells her libido and Ishrya's struggles with Kasturba
 She realized that this person They have a duty to remain celibate so that they can learn the love of lust instead
 For Gandhi, celibacy meant "control of thoughts, words and actions within the senses"

 After returning from South Africa, where he had completed advocacy and was associated with wealth and success, he renounced western-style clothes

 Gandhi's opinion was that if Indians started making their own clothes, it would be an economic shock to the British settled in India
 Consequently, the charkha was later included in the Indian national flag

 Nevertheless, Jack Homer, noting Gandhi's long correspondence with Jinnah about the subject of Pakistan, says- "although Gandhi was personally against partition, he suggested a consensus under which the Congress and the Muslim League would form the provisional government
" Get your freedom by compromising below, after which the question of partition will be decided by the opinion of the districts where the number of Muslims Is good "

 It is still politically controversial today, as pakistani-american historian Ayesha Jalal argues that Gandhi and the Congress were not willing to share power with the Muslim League because of the partition, for example Hindu nationalist politician Pravin Togadia also Criticizing the leadership about the subject, it also indicates that the extreme weakness of their part led to the partition of India

 gandhi ne 1930 main germany main yahudiyon ke utpedan ko satyagrah ke bheetar hi sandarbhit kaha

 Luna Nagar windos vista microsoft ke oparating system kii shrinkhalaa kii sabase nai kadi he or sambhawatah windos 95 ke pashchaat sabase krantikari bhi
 Although the Vista operating system has gained more popularity due to its three-dimensional graphics format and various desktop animations, it is in fact considered to be the most secure operating system ever released by Microsoft
 sanchaar or netwarking ke lihaaj se bhi yah apane se pichley aaparating system kii tulana main zyada kshamtawan he
 Hindi support for Vista is also fully available and through the Hindi Language Interface Pack, Windows Vista can be fully painted in Hindi
 computer upyogkartaaon ke man main jigyaasa he ki kya sachmuch unhen microsoft kii ore se jari kiya gaya nayaa oparating system windos vista apnaane kii jarurat he
 Does Microsoft's previous operating systems Windows XP Windows 2003 and Windows 2000 have such features that it is not possible to ignore
 microsoft kaa daawa he ki vista pichley windos kii tulana main adhik sakasham, saral, tej, sudarshan or surakshit he
 Vista opens and closes faster than previous operating systems
 start ap or shat down prakriyaayein paanch se das second main puri ho jaati hai
 Although Vista's relatively better hardware also contributes to this, special efforts have been made in the code of the operating system itself
 vista kii teji kaa kaaran uski memri ke prabandhan kii nai takanic bhi he jo adhik istemaal kiye jane vaale anuprayogon ko pehle se hi loding ke liye taiyaar rakhti he
 This is called 'memory fetch'
 vista main die gaye ready boost feechar ne bhi isaki gati badhaane main yogadan diya he
 Until now, pagefiles were used as virtual memory to meet additional memory requirements in Windows
 inhen computer kii hard discs par rakhaa jaataa tha
 But Vista has a provision of using a USB drive that works at a much faster speed than a hard disk
 microsoft ne apane nae aaparating system main hybrid hard drive saport bhi pradaan kiya he jiske tahat flash drive or paaramparik hard drive donon ko sanyukt rup se istemaal kar computer kii gati badha jaati he
 One of the first things to get noticed in Windows Vista is its beautiful vocal and graphic effects called Windows Aero
 haalaanki maikintosh computer par is tarah ke sudarshan graphics pehle se hi maujuud hai lekin windos plateform par ye pehali baar 'vista' ke madhyam se hi saamne aae hai
 On computers with Windows Vista Home Premium, Business, Ultimate and Enterprise editions that have a good graphics adapter, Aero's stunning graphics effects can be enjoyed
 is mukhaawaran ne windos kaa kalevar hi badal diya he or use pehle kii tulana main behad aakarshak, vividhtapurna or shaleen bana diya he
 Aero's high quality graphics and visual effects enhance the beauty of a Windows computer but it does not impair the functionality or speed of the computer
 airo ke do pramukh feechar hai- windos flip or windos flip 3di
 Through them you can organize your desktop more conveniently
 aam taur par microsoft ke aaparating systamon ko lekar computer upyogkartaaon main yah dharna rahi he ki ve apane pratidwandvi oparating systamon kii tulana main kam surakshit hai or virus, hekking, spa ware aadi kii chapet main apekshaakrit adhik aasaani se aa jate hai
 Microsoft has paid special attention to this in Vista
 haalaanki vista kii mul 'karnel' to nae sire se nahin likhi he lekin uski suraksha ko is baar bahut majboot bana diya gaya he
 First of all, now not all parts of this operating system run in kernel mode, but only a select few of them run
 vista main zyaadaatar driver or software yujar mod main chalate hai or karnel mod main kisi bhi na cheez ko install karnaa aasaan nahin rah gaya he
 This requires security certificate and administrator level rights
 or administrator str ke visheshadhikaar praapt karnaa, visheshkar daftaron main, ab bahut mushkil hoga
 Windows Vista has limited common user rights
 aisa bhi nahin he ki aap bataur saamaanya upyogkarta ke apane computer main ko software instaal hi na kar paaen
 To do this, they get the necessary rights temporarily
 microsoft ne vista aaparating system install karne ke lihaaj se computaron kii do shreniyan banaai hai- vista capable pisi or vista premium ready 
 All such computers are Windows Vista enabled with at least 800 mhz processor and 512 MB system memory available
 is tarah ke procesar to ab durlabh se ho gaye hai kyonki bazaar main 2 gigahatrj se kam ke procesar shaayad hi koi kharid rahaa ho
 If you have bought your computer in the last two years, then its processor will have at least this much capacity
 rahi system memri kii baat to ho saktaa he ki aapke paaramparik computer main 128 embi yaa 256 embi memri lagi ho
 In such a situation, you may have to upgrade your RAM by spending seven to eight hundred rupees
 windos vista sakasham computer ke liye kam se kam diarect eks 9 ko samarthan dene vaala graphics card hona chahie jisamen dabludidm driver samarthan uplabdh ho
 a graphics memory of 32 MB in a computer's graphics card is sufficient
 iske atirikt aapako ek dividi rome drive kii aavashyaktaa padegi jo sambhavat: aapke computer main pehle se hi maujuud ho
 With only 20 GB of available space on a hard disk, 15 GB of free space is sufficient
 bas, windos vista home basic sanskaran chalaane ke liye aapako or kisi cheez kii jarurat nahin he
