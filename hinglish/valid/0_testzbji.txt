 a Stirling engine is a thermal engine that is implemented by cyclic pressures and expansions at different temperatures of air, gas, or a fluid in such a way that the conversion of the thermal energy into pure form results in mechanical action
 yah ingine ek bhaap ingine kii tarah hota he jisamen ingine diwaar ke madhyam se purna taap ko sthanantarit kiya jaataa he
 It is traditionally known as an external combustion engine as opposed to an internal combustion engine where heat input is done by combustion of fuel within the amount of working fluid
 bhaap ingine dwaara karyrat taral ke rup main taral or gas, donon padaarthon main pani ke istemaal ke vipareet sterling ingine hawa yaa helium jaise gasiy taral kii nishchit maatra ko sthaayee rup se sanlagn karata he
 As in all heat engines, the normal cycle involves compressing the cold gas, heating the gas, expanding the hot gas, and finally cooling the gas before repeating the cycle
 ise bhaap ingine ke pratidwandvi ke rup main multah 1816 main ek audyogic mukhya chaalak ke rup main vichaarit kiya gaya tha, iskaa vyaavhaarik upyog ek bade paimaane par ek sadi se bhi adhik tak nune-bijli gharelu anuprayogon ke liye simit tha
 The Stirling engine is known for its high efficiency, smooth operation and the ease with which it can use almost any heat source
 vaikalpik or akshay urja sroton ke saath yah sangatta, parmparik eendhan kii keemat badhane or jalwaayu parivartan or tel ke simit utpaadan ke maddenzar tezi se mahatvapurn ban gai he
 It is currently driving interest as a core component of the engine, micro combined heat and power unit, in which it is more efficient and safer than a comparable steam engine
 antariksh anusandhan main upyog ke liye sterling ingine par nasa dwaara bhi vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Robert Sterling, the Scottish inventor of the first practical example of a closed-cycle air engine in 1816, and by Fleming Jenkin in early 1884 suggested that such engines should be called genetically Stirling engines
 is namakaran prastaav ko zyada samarthan nahin mila or bazaar main sulabh vibhinn prakaar ke injanon ko iske vyaktigat diziner yaa nirmaataa ke naam dwaara janaa jaataa rahaa jaise rider kaa, robinsan kaa yaa henrisi kaa vaayu ingine

 However, nearly thirty years later Graham Walker expressed sorrow over the fact that terminology such as hot air engines continued to be used with the interchangeability of the Stirling engine, which itself was widely and indiscriminately used
 ab sthiti main kuch sudhaar hua he, kam se kam shaikshik sahitya main or ab aam taur par yah sweekaar kiya gaya he ki 'sterling ingine' vishesh rup se sthaayee gasiy karyrat taral vaale band-chakree punaryoji taap ingine ko sandarbhit karegaa, jahaan band-chakree ko ek thermodynamik pranali ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he jisamen karyrat taral padaarth sthaayee rup se pranali ke bheetar dhaarit hota he or punaryoji ek vishesh prakaar ke aantarik taap excanger or thermal store jise rionrator ke rup main janaa jaataa he, ke upyog kaa varnan karata he
 One such engine existed in 1931 which worked on the same principle but used a fluid instead of a gaseous liquid and was called a Malone heat engine
 aisa, band-chakree sanchaalan ke baad se hona shuru hua ki sterling ingine ek bahya dahan ingine he jo apane karyrat drav ko ek bahari taap strot se aapurti kiye ja rahe urja input se pruthak karata he
 There are several possible implementations of the Stirling engine, most of which fall under the category of reciprocating piston engines

 An internal regenerative heat exchanger increases the thermal efficiency of the Stirling engine, a feature not common in a hot air engine
 Cut-away diagram of a rhombic drive beta configuration Stirling engine design: As a result of closed cyclic operation, the heat that drives the Stirling engine must be transmitted to the working fluid from a heat source by a heat exchanger and therefore into a heat sink
 ek sterling ingine pranali main kam se kam ek taap strot, ek taap sinc or paanch taap excanger hote hai
 In some types it can be combined or omitted
 taap strot, eendhan kaa dahan ho saktaa he or chunki dahan utpaada karyrat taral ke saath mishrit nahin hote or ingine ke aantarik gatiman bhaagon ke saath sampark main aate hai, ek sterling ingine ko aise eendhan par chalaaya ja saktaa he jo ingine ke anya aatanrik bhaag ko kharaab kar sakate hai jaise landphil gas jisamen siloksen shaamil hota he
 Some other suitable heat sources include solar energy, geological energy, nuclear power, waste heat or even organic
 If the heat source is solar energy, then regular solar mirrors and solar material can be used
 iske alaava, frescell lens ke istemaal kii vakaalat kii gai he 
 Sterling engines powered by solar power are becoming increasingly popular, as they are a heavy environmental option for power generation

 In the case of an engine operating at high energy and pressure, the heat exchanger with hot parts should be made of alloys that maintain great strength even at such temperatures and which will neither decay nor slow down
 sterling ingine main, punaryoji ek aantarik taap excanger hota he or garm or thande sthanon ke bich asthaayee taap sangrah he, jo is prakaar se nirmit he ki karyrat drav isse hoke guzarataa he, pehle ek disha main or phir duusari

 Increasing thermal efficiency by recycling internal heat in a Stirling engine is the primary function of regeneration that would otherwise pass through the engine irreversibly
 As a secondary effect, the increased heat efficiency ensures a higher power output from a given hot and cold heat exchanger, although in practice this additional energy may not be used solely as an additional "dead space"
 Pumping damage can be spontaneously counteracted in practical and regenerative
 punaryoji ek thermal sandharitra kii tarah kaam karata he
 The ideal regenerator has a very high thermal efficiency, very low thermal conductivity parallel to the fluid flow, very high thermal conductivity perpendicular to the fluid flow, almost no volume, and does not introduce any friction from the working fluid
 As the regenerator approaches these ideal limits, the efficiency of the Stirling engine increases
 sterling ingine punaryoji kii abhiklpana main jo chunauti he vah he bahut zyada atirikt aantarik maatra, yaa pravaah pratirodh ke bina paryaapt taap excanger pradaan karnaa, jinamein se donon hi shakti or dakshata ko kam karte he
 These inherent design conflicts are factors that limit the efficiency of a practical Stirling engine

 The regenerator is a key component invented by Robert Stirling and its presence distinguishes the original Stirling engine from any other closed cycle hot air engine
 haalanki, kisi pratyaksh punaryoji ke bina bhi kai injanon ko sterling ingine ke rup main hi varnit kiya ja saktaa he, 'deele fitting' visthaapak ke saath saral beta or gamma vinyas main, visthapakon kii sataha or uske silendar chakree taap antaran karenge jisamen karyrat drav vishesh rup se nune-dabaav ke injanon main mahatvapurn punaryoji prabhaav pradaan karata he
 The same is true of the route connecting the hot and cold cylinders of the Alpha configured engine

 Marine engines can use ambient water
 sanyukt taap or bijli pranaaliyon ke maamle main, tapiya prayojanon ke liye pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se ingine ke thande pani kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Alternatively, heat can be sent to ambient temperature and the heat sink is maintained at a lower temperature by cryogenic fluid or icy water

 garm silendar ucch taapmaana ke hit excanger ke andar hota he or thanda silendar nune taapmaana hit excanger ke andar sthit hota he
 This type of engine has a high power-to-volume ratio but typically has technical problems due to the high temperature of the hot piston and the durability of its seal
 vyaavhaarik taur par, kuch atirikt mrit sthaan kii keemat par garm kshetra se sil ko hataane ke liye aamtaur par piston ek bade insulate kaa vahan karata he

 The Beta Sterling consists of a single power piston located on the same shaft as a displacing piston within the same cylinder
 visthaapak piston dhilaa feet hota he or vistaarit gas se koi urja grahan nahin karata lekin keval garm hit excanger se thande hit excanger main karyrat gas ko le jaataa he
 When the working gas is pushed into the heated part of the cylinder, it expands and pushes the power piston

 The beta type, as opposed to the alpha type, avoids the technical problems of heat placement seals
 phir, nimnlikhit chitra aantarik hit excangers yaa ek punaryoji ko nahin darshaate, jise visthaapak ke aasapaas gas ke raste main rakhaa jayega
 a gamma sterling is simply a beta sterling in which the power piston is mounted in a different cylinder next to the displacement piston cylinder, but still attached to the same flywheel
 donon silendaron ke gas unke bich mukt rup se pravaahit ho sakate hai or ek ekal sharir banaate hai
 This configuration produces a low compression ratio but is mechanically simple and is often used in multi-cylinder Stirling engines

 The first discussion of the Stirling cycle machine using freely moving components is presumed to be a British patent disclosure of 1876
 is mashin ko refricrator ke rup main abhikalpit kiya gaya 
 The first consumer product using a free piston sterling device was a portable freeze, manufactured by Twinbird Corporation of Japan and proposed by Coleman in the US in 2004

 Thus a thermoacoustic device usually does not have a displacer, similar to the one found in beta and gamma sterling
 1816 main sterling ingine robert sterling dwaara avishkrut or patentakrut tha
 It followed earlier attempts to build air engines, but was probably first practiced when an engine manufactured by Stirling in 1818 was used to pour water into a mine

 Subsequent development was done by Robert Sterling and his brother James, who was an engineer, resulting in patents that improved the various configurations of the original engine, including pressurization, to run all equipment at Dundee Iron Foundry until 1843 The power output was increased significantly
 haalanki yah vivaadit he, yah vyapak rup se mana jaataa he ki eendhan kii bachat ke saath-saath avishkaarak, us samay ke bhaap ingine ke liye ek surakshit vikalp ke nirmaan ke liye prerit hue, jiskaa boyler aksar visphot kar jaataa tha or jiske kaaran kai prakaar kii chote aati thim or ghaatak parinaam hote the
 Maximizing energy and efficiency at very high temperatures required the Stirling engine to run which exposed the limitations of the material available at the time, and some engines that were built in those early years suffered frequent failures
 - For example, the Dundee Foundry engine was replaced with a steam engine after the failure of three hot cylinders in four years

 However, around 1860 miniature engines of the Stirling / hot air type were produced in sufficient quantities and applications were discovered wherever reliable sources of low to medium energy were needed, such as increasing water or providing air to church organs

 Encouraged by its first experimental engine, which produced 30mm × 25mm bore and 16 w shaft energy from stroke, Philips began the development program
 is kaary ko dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan jari rakhaa gaya or 1940 ke dashak ke ant main philips ke sahaayak johan di vit dordrecht ko tip 10 kaa "utpaadan" or generator set main shaamil karne ke liye diya gaya
 As a result, a bore and a stroke of 55 mm x 27 mm were named MP1002CA at 200 w grade

 Since the Stirling engine is a closed process, it contains a gas clot known as a "working fluid", usually containing air, hydrogen, and helium
 saadhaaran sanchaalan main ingine sil hote hai or gas andar nahin jaati he yaa ingine ko chhodti nahin
 Valves are not required here like other piston engines
 The Stirling engine, like most heat engines, undergoes four processes: cooling, contraction, heating, and diffusion
 yah kaary gas ko garm or thande hit excanger ke bich aage or peeche sthanantarit karne se hota he, jiske liye aksar taapak or shitalk ke bich rionrator hota he
 a hot thermal device is exposed to thermal by means of external heat such as a fuel flame and a cold thermal device is exposed to thermal by an external heat tank such as an air fan
 gas ke taapmaana main badlaav anukulit gas ke dabaav ko bhi badalegaa jabaki piston kii chaal gas ke vaikalpik rup se failaav or dabaav kaa karan banati he
 The gas follows the behavior of the gas principle which describes how gaseous pressure, temperature and volume are related
 jab gas ko garam kiya jaataa he, to chunki vah ek band kaksh main hoti he, dabaav badhata jaataa he jo phir power piston ko power stroke utpann karne ke liye prerit karata he
 When the gas is cold and the pressure is low, it is assumed that the gas will have to work less during return injury to the gas by the piston, resulting in the production of pure energy
 jab piston kaa ek konaa vaataavaran ke liye khulaa rahata he tab prakriya thodi bhinn rahati he
 Because the closed volume of the working gas comes in contact with the heated part, it expands and is functional on both the piston and the atmosphere
 jab kriyasheel gas thande hisse ke sampark main aata he, to iskaa dabaav vaataavaraniya dabaav se bhi neeche gir jaataa he or vaataavaran piston ko dhakelta he jo ki gas par kaam karata he
 In short, the Stirling engine uses the temperature difference of the heated part and the cold part to establish the process of heating the fixed gas clot and spreading, cooling, and compressing, as a result the thermal energy is converted into mechanical energy
 garm or thande strot ke bich taapmaana bhinnata jitani zyada hoti he, tapiya kushalta utani hi adhik hoti he
 The assumed utility is equivalent to the Carnot action but the utility of real engines is less than this value due to friction and damage
 bahut kam urja ke upyog vaale injanon ko banaaya gaya he jo ki kam se kam 0

 Often both the minimum pressure and average pressure of the working fluid in high-energy Stirling engines are higher than the atmospheric pressure
 aarambhik ingine ke dabaav ko ek pump dwaara sampadit kiya ja saktaa he athwa ek sampeedit gas tanks se ingine ko bhar kar, yaa keval ingine ko us vakt sil karke jab ausat taapmaana, ausat karyanvayan taapmaana se kam hota he
 All these methods increase the clotting of the working fluid in thermodynamic activity
 sabhi ushmiya yantron ko ek uchit tareeke se aakaar main hona chahie taaki aavashyak dar se garmi kaa sthaanantaran hota rahe
 If the thermal device is well designed and can provide the heat flow required for convective heat transfer, the engine will be able to generate energy in the first approximation proportional to the average pressure, predicted by the waste number and the binary number

 abhyaas main, adhiktam dabaav, paatr ke surakshit dabaav tak simit hota he
 Similar to the other dimensions of the Stirling engine design, optimization is multivariate and has mostly conflicting requirements
 ucch taapmaana or dabaav main, vayudabeey ghumaavdaar paatro main oxigen, yaa garam hawa injanon main kriyasheel gas, ingine ke chikne tel se milakar visphot kar sakati he
 At least one person has died due to this explosion
 chiknayee, ushmiya yantron khaskar rijenrator main jam bhi sakate hai
 It is for these reasons that manufacturers prefer non-lubricating and cheap friction items that use normal force in the transfer of parts, especially in the sliding of seals
 There are some designs that use membranes to completely prevent slippage for sealed pistons
 ye kuch kaaran hai jisaki vajah se sterling ingine ke rakh-rakhaav kii kam aavashyaktaa padati he tathaa antar-dahan vaale injanon se zyada lambii aayu hoti he
 Unlike inter-combustion engines, the Stirling engine has the ability to be more reliable due to the ease of using the renewal heat source, not making more noise, and lower cost

 The thermal utility can also be equated, categorized from 15% to 30%
 anuprayog jaise micro-chp main, antar-dahan kii apeksha sterling ingine ko zyada pasand kiya jaataa he
 Other examples are water pumps, aeronautics and power generation that use those abundant energy resources such as solar energy and biofuels such as agricultural waste and other wastes such as pet waste, etc
 which do not work with inter-combustion engines Could do it
 Sterling has also been used in Gotland class submarines of Sweden
 phir bhi prati ikai urja kii adhik laagat, kam urja ghanatv ke kaaran or purjon ke mahange daamon kii vajah se sterling ingine motor-gaadi ke ingine ke mukaable mulya-pratisparddhaatmak nahin he
 Basic analysis is based on closed-form Schmidt analysis
 istemaal kii gai gas main nune taap kshamta honi chahie, taaki die gaye sthanantarit garmi ki maatra adhiktam dabaav kaa nirmaan kar sake
 Keeping this issue in mind, helium would be the best gas due to its low heat capacity

 The 1911 revolution of China resulted in the end of China's last dynasty and became a Chinese republic
 yah ek bahut badi ghatana thi
 The Manchu people had been ruling China for the last three hundred years, which came to an end
 beesvin shatabdi main china asia kaa pratham desh tha, jahaan ganatantric sarkaar kii sthapana hui
 The revolutionaries in China followed the French and ended the monarchy forever
 antarrashtriya jagat main china ne hameshaa apane ko sarvshereshth raashtra mana he
 But after the defeat in two opium wars, all the pride and pride of China fell down
 jab europea luteron ne china kaa darwaja jabardastee khol diya or jab se china par aarthik prabhutv kaayam karne ke liye vividh europea deshon main ek bheeshan hode prarambh ho gai
 Some patriotic citizens of China used to be very concerned with this plight of their country
 unhone samaj liya ki jab tak unhen videshiyon se chhutkaaraa nahin milegaa, tab tak unki sthiti main kisi tarah kaa sudhaar nahin hoga
 They considered Manchu-rule as primarily responsible for exploitation of Chinese people by foreigners
 isliye videshiyon kaa virodh karne ke liye or manchu-shashan kaa ant karne ke liye ve apana sanghathan banane lage
 At the end of the nineteenth century, exploitation by foreigners increased so much that the people of China had no other option but to get rid of foreign exploitation, except for a massive revolution
 aisi sthiti main desh ko kranti se bachaane kaa ek upaay hota he- shashan vyavastha main sudhaar
 There was a movement for reforms in China for a few days, but Emperor Tzushi was a reactionary ruler and did not want any change in governance
 is haalat main china ke deshbhakt yah sochane ke liye majaboor ho gaye ki manchu-shashan kaa ant kar ek nai krantikari sarkaar kii sthapana kii jaae
 This was the only way to protect the country of foreign exploitation
 boxr vidroh ke uparaant china ke sudhaarwadiyon ne shashan ko kuch sudhaar yojanaon ko karyanvit karne ke liye baadhya kiya
 Therefore a plan of reforms was implemented in China
 sena ke sanghathan main kai sudhaar kiye gaye
 In 1905 AD, orders were issued to complete the old examination system of China and try to mold the Chinese rule in a modern way
 rus or japan ke yuddh main japan kii vijay se bhi china main sudhaarwadi andolan ko paryaapt bal mila
 In such a situation, the reform movement in China took a sharp shape, but reforms were being implemented at a very slow pace on behalf of the government
 sudhaarwadi log china main sansadeey shashan ore vaid rajasatta kii sthapana chaahate the
 But the government turned down the demand for a parliamentary system
 is haalat main kranti kaa hona avashyambhavi ho gaya
 The awakening in China's new generation was a fundamental reason for China's revolution
 1905 i
 main china main pracheen pariksha paddati or rajkeey paddati kaa ant ho gaya or rajkeey padon par niyukti ke liye aadhunik shiksha ko mahatv diya gaya
 Therefore, after 1905 AD many Chinese students started going to America and Europe, but those who could not go to Europe or America started getting education in Japan itself
 is tarah chinivalon kaa videshon se sampark kaayam hua
 He was greatly influenced by countries like Europe, America etc
 and became biased towards reforming the western countries for the salvation of his country
 is samay japan main bahut-se aise chini deshbhakt rahete the, jo china kii sarkaar ke kopbhaajan bane the ore jinhen desh se nikaal diya gaya tha
 Revolutionary organizations of these people were established in Japan
 china ke jo vidhyaarthee japan jate the, unka sambandh in krantikari sanghathanon se anivaary rup se hota tha or jab ve swadesh lautate the to krantikari vichaaron se otprot hote the
 In 1908, the Chinese revolutionary leaders who were forced to take shelter in Japan, were spreading their ideas with great enthusiasm among these Chinese students
 japan ke prabhaav ke kaaran desh ko majboot banane or samaaj ko aadhunik rup dene kii pravriti jor pakad rahi thi
 As a result, new ideas filled the minds of the people, who ignited the sparks of revolution
 china kii kranti kaa ek or kaaran tha, aarthik durdasha
 Economically, there was widespread unrest among the people of China
 china kii aabaadi badi teji se bad rahi thi or sarkaar uske bhojan kaa intjaam nahin kar paa rahi thi
 There was an abundance of famines and floods in the country, due to which the agriculture was greatly damaged
 1910-11 main china kii anek nadiyon main bhayankar baadh ai
 This destroyed agriculture as well as thousands of villages
 lakhon vyakti begharbar ho gaye or unki aajeevika kaa koi bhi saadhan nahin rahaa
 The government did not make any arrangements to help the people in this situation, it was perfectly natural to come up with ideas of revolution in such an economic situation
 desh kii aarthik sthiti se pareshaan hokar china ke log aajeevika kii talash main videshon main jaakar basane lage
 First he went to the United States
 kuch dinon tak america sarkaar ne iskaa virodh nahin kiya, lekin jab bahut badi sankhya main chini log america pahunchne lage to sarkaar ne kanoon banaakar unka aagaman roak diya
 When the door of the US was closed to the Chinese, they started moving to other neighboring countries like Malaya, Philippines, Hawaiian Islands etc
 is prakaar, chini janata kaa ek bahut bada bhaag videshon ke sampark main aayaa
 This part was different from the educated and through this the spirit of revolution entered the lower class of China
 beesvin shatabdi ke pratham dashak main china main krantikari pravritiyon kaa jor bahut bad gaya or krantikari dalon kaa sanghathan vyapak rup se hua
 Many of China's revolutionary parties were destroyed after the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion, yet the spirit of revolution in China could never be suppressed
 boxr vidroh ke turant baad china main punah krantikari paatiyaan sangathit hone lageen
 One of the most important of these revolutionary organizations was Dr
 Sanayat Sen
 china ke krantikariyon ko sangathit karne main dow san yaat sen kaa bada hi mahatvapurn yogadan tha
 Between 1884–85 AD, China suffered a greater humiliation than France and they all started planning the end of the Manchu dynasty
 antat, ve chini kranti ke janmdata siddh hue
 The failure of the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 AD restored Dr
 Sen's popularity, and the Chinese began to attract more and more people
 in ghatnaon ke baad sanyaat sen kii khyaati main badi vruddhi ho gai
 Prior to 1911 AD, the spirit of opposition was developing against the central government of right picking in the provincial rulers
 picking kii sarkaar se anumati praapt kar kai videshi form main china main railway linon kaa nirmaan kara rahi thi
 Many Chinese provincials wanted that they should have the right to construct railway lines in their provinces
 lekin, picking kii sarkaar aisa nahin chaahati thi
 She herself wanted to build railway lines
 lekin, iske liye use paas dhan kaa abhaav tha
 The Chinese government wanted to complete this task by taking loans from abroad
 videshi karj lene se china kii kendriya sarkaar par videshiyon kaa prabhaav badhata ja rahaa tha
 Due to this, the rulers of the provinces were getting very worried and insisted that the burden of railway construction in their own territories should be handed over to them
 is vishay par kendriya or prantiy sarkaro ke bich matbhed bahut bad gaya
 Due to the policy of central governance in the provinces, dissatisfaction was very strong and at the same time when a foreign company was given the right to build a railway line, the wave of revolution spread all around
 anek sthanon par manchu shashan ke khilaaf vidroh shuru ho gaya
 The fire of rebellion immediately spread throughout the country
 kranti kii jwaala teji se yangtsi tat par upar, neeche tathaa dakshin kii ore failane lagi
 For some time in the south, the province of Shatung declared its independence, although it soon came back under central rule
 chihali main bhi visheshkar sainikon main vidroh kii bhaavana faili, kintu yangtsi ke uttar main shansi praant ko chhodkar, sabhi praant kendriya shashan ke prati nishthavan rahe or vahaan shashan sudrudh rahaa
 The whole movement seemed to be a series of sudden and independent revolts, not a planned revolution
 iskaa ek kaaran yah tha ki krantikari pehle vibhinn kendron main krantikari bhaawanaaon ko ubhaarna chaahate the
 a second reason for these sporadic revolts was also that groups of supporters of the revolution were essentially formed at the local level, not at the national level, and their plans were also made at the local level
 yah bhi daawa kiya gaya ki baad main kisi tithi ko ek saath sabhi krantikari guton ke vidroh kar dene kii bhi yojana bani thi, kintu haankon main bam fatne or tatpashchaat police kaarywahi ke kaaran vidroh kar dena anivaary ho gaya
 These events led to panic picking
 sarkaar ne yuan shih kaai ko hoopel or hunaan kaa governor niyukt kiya
 He held the condition before assuming office that next year a meeting of Parliament would be called, a cabinet responsible for it would be made
 krantikari dal kii manyata di jaaegi or use sena ke punargathan kaa puraa adhikaar diya jayega
 On 27 October Yuan was appointed as the superior of all the armies
 isi bich usne 22 oktober, 1911 ko kendriya vidhansabha kii baithak bulaai
 The Assembly was at this time proposing to reform the Manchu king
 usne yah maang kii ki un padaadhikariyon ko apdasth kar diya jaae, jo videshiyon ke samarthak hai
 The Manchu king was forced to do so and all the pro-foreigners who were pro-foreigners were removed
 nihsandeh yah lokmat kii baari vijay thi
 At this time there was a great need that the administration of the rule should be given to a qualified person who would suppress the chaos and rebellion and establish peace in the country
 yah kaam yuan shih kaai ko diya gaya
 On 1 November 1911, he was appointed to the post of Prime Minister
 isi bich vidhansabha ne unniis dhaaraon kaa ek samvidhan taiyaar kar liya, jiskaa aashay china main vaidhanik rajtantr kaayam karnaa tha
 On November 16, Yuan Shih Kai formed his government
 china main jab kranti kaa visphot hua, us samay dow sanyaat sen america main tha
 He reached Shanghai on 24 December
 sabhi krantikariyon ne use gutbandiyon se dur rahane vaala vyakti maanate hue uskaa swaagat kiya or yah aashaa vyakt kii gai ki vah kranti kii ekta ko sahi netritv pradaan karegaa
 On 29 December, the revolutionaries elected him as the president of their government
 sattarah praanton main se solah praanton ke pratinidhiyon ne 1 janvari, 1912 i 
 ko use adhyaksh pad par asin kiya
 Thus, China now has two governments
 ek nanking kii ganatantric sarkaar or duusari picking kii manchu sarkaar
 The Manchu government was completely dependent on Yuan Shieh
 sanyaat sen kii krantikari sarkaar ban jane se yuan shih kaai ko raashtrapati pad par asin karne kii jo baatcheet chal rahi thi, vah samaapt ho gai
 This led to the breakdown of the conversation between the revolutionary government and the picking government
 manchu sarkaar ne nanking sarkaar ko kuchalane kaa nishchay kiya
 But, he did not have the power to do it
 dow sanyaat sen ne bhi anubhav kiya ki kendriya sarkaar se yuddh jari rakhana bekaar he
 Both sides were tired
 unke paas dhan, netritv or ekta sabaki kami thi
 At the same time, there was also fear of foreign interference
 isliye china kii donon sarkaron ke madhya samjhaute kii baatcheet chalane lagi
 The leaders of the revolutionary government thought that the end of the Manchu dynasty was necessary for the new creation and salvation of China; Because the Manchu court has become so distorted that it is impossible to communicate the new life in it
 yuan shih kaai ne is baat ko sweekaar kiya or isi aadhaar par dow sanyaat sen ke saath usne 12 farvari, 1912 i
 ko ek samjhauta kar liya
 According to this agreement, the Manchu dynasty rule from China was ended and the Republic was established in China

 cricket ke niyam marilibone cricket club dwaara sthapit niyamon kaa ek samooh he jo nishpakshta or ekarupata sunishchit karne ke liye duniya bhar ke cricket ke niyamon kii vyakhya karata he
 There are currently 42 laws that provide information on how to play the game, including all aspects of how a team wins and the batsman's dismissal, from the preparation and maintenance of the pitch
 emsisi england ke landan main sthit ek nijee club he or abu is khel kaa adhikarik prabandh nikaay nahin he; haalanki emsisi is khel ke niyamon kaa copirite apane paas barkaraar rakhe hue hai or keval emsisi hi in niyamon ko badal saktaa he, yadhyapi aajkal aam taur par keval khel kii vaishvik niamak sanstha international cricket council ke saath vichaar vimarsh ke baad hi aisa kiya jaataa he
 'cricket is one of the few sports for which regulatory principles are referred to as' laws' rather than' rules' or 'regulations'
 haalanki vishesh pratiyogitaaon ke liye kanoonon kaa poorak taiyaar karne or / yaa inamen bhinnata ke liye viniyamon par sahamati banaayi ja sakati he
 The origins of cricket have been debatable but it probably originated from many sports in which a ball is hit by a bat or a club
 It expanded into Britain in the eighteenth century as a speculative sport that was particularly popular among the British elite
 sabase shuruaati niyam bhi paise kii badi rakam daanv par lagaaye jane vaale is khel ko viniyamit karne ke sandarbh main hi taiyaar kiye gaye the
 The earliest existing code of cricket was drafted by some 'rich and gentlemen' who used the Artillery Ground in London in 1744
 1755 main "vibhinn cricket klbon, visheshkar paal maal main star or garter" dwaara sanshodhit liye ja rahe niyamon ke anya sandarbh maujuud hai, jiske baad 1774 main "star or garter main kent, hampshire, saare, sasex, middlesex or landan ke amiron or sajjanon kii ek samiti" dwaara niyamon main ek sanshodhan kiya gaya tha
 a printed form of the rules was published in 1775 and a further amendment to the law was followed in 1786 by a similar body in Kent, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex, Middlesex and London
 haalanki in niyamon kaa saarvbhaumik rup se paalan nahin kiya gaya tha jab alag-alag match alag-alag maargdarshan main khele gaye the
 On 30 May 1788, the Marylibon Cricket Club, which was formed just a year earlier by the eminent nobles and gentlemen who played the game, formulated its first Code of Rules
 jabaki niyamon ke emsisi sanskaran ko tatkaal puri tarah se sweekaar nahin kiya gaya tha yaa nirantarata ke saath lagu nahin kiya gaya tha, yah in niyamon kaa parvarti sanskaran hi he jo aaj ke khel ko niyantrit karata he
 The next major change in 1809 was seen as the next standardization of the weight of the ball from 5 and 6 ounces to 5
5 and 5
75 ounces, and the width of the cricket bat was first standardized
 non-striker stamps ko lagane vaali gend par ran banane ke niyam ko nirarthak banaaya gaya tha or gendbaajon kii madad ke liye stamps kii lambaai badhaakar 22 se 24 inch or gilliyon kii lambaai 6 se 7 inch kar di gayi thi or ampiron kaa mahatva or adhik badha diya gaya tha
 Eventually a new method of dismissing the batsman was introduced
 isse pehle chunki cricket main ek kathor gend kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha or leg-pad istemaal nahin kiye jate the, khilaadi swaabhaavik rup se apane pairon ko wicket se dur rakhkar khelte the
 When the batsmen started wearing pads, they agreed to cover their stumps with their feet in order to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps and bowling them
 isliye ek "leg bifor wicket" kaa niyam laayaa gaya jisase ki koi ballebaaj jo apane pairon se stump par gend lagane se rokane kii koshish karegaa vah out ho jayega
 In 1829 the length of the stump was increased from 24 to 27 inches and the length of the gills was increased from 7 to 8 inches, once again to help the bowlers
 pehali baar stump kii motaai kaa ullekh kiya gaya
 On 19 May 1835, a new Code of Rules was approved by the MCC Committee and on 21 April 1884 another Code was approved
 1884 ke niyamon main khilaadiyon kii sankhya ko pehali baar aupchaarik rup diya gaya tha or gend ke aakaar ko bhi pehali baar aupchaarik rup diya gaya tha
 a follow-on rule was then introduced
 yah us samasya ke jawaab main kiya gaya tha jisamen kisi khel ko jeetne ke liye ek team dwaara apni vipakshi team ko do baar out karnaa jaruri tha
 a team that has batted before and has made a complete catch by scoring too many runs in that match has to wait until it is dismissed for the second time before it gets to the opposition team for the second time
 Could try to bar out
 chunki cricket ek simit-samay kaa khel he, iskaa matlab yah he ki vah team jo apni vipakshi team par haaavee rahi he use khel ko jeetne kii bajaay barabari par khatm karne ke liye majaboor kiya ja saktaa he
 The initial follow-on rule was faulty because it required a follow-on when a team was left behind
 koi team ek bigadati pich par ant main gendbaaji karne main sakasham hone ke liye badale main pehali pari ke apane antim viketon ko jaanboojhkar ganvaa de sakati thi
 The follow-on rule was later changed to require that any team who is sufficiently ahead of its opposition team has the option of implementing it or not
 1947 main 7 may ko emsisi dwaara ek nayi samhita ko manjuuri di gayi
 After several minor amendments to the Code of 1947 in 1979, a new Code was approved at a special general meeting of the MCC on 21 November
 ise 1980 ke code ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Among other changes, metric units are now used after Imperial units in specifications
 1992 main 1980 ke code kaa ek doosraa sanskaran taiyaar kiya gaya
 In 2000, a new code, which first included a preamble defining the spirit of cricket, was approved on 3 May
 is code ko saral angreji main dubaara likhaa gaya tha or yah pichley code se kahin adhik tarkmulak he
 The length of an over was officially standardized over six balls for all matches, although in practice this was the case 20 or so years earlier
 2003 main 2000 kii samhita kaa ek doosraa sanskaran taiyaar kiya gaya jisamen san 2000 kii samhita ko lagu karne se utpann hone vaale sanshodhano ko shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Ball throwing was first regulated in draft laws in 1829
 1860 main pehali baar overarm gendbaaji kii anumati di gai thi
 In 1889 the length of an over was increased from four balls to five balls
 san 1900 main ek over kii lambaai chah gendon ke rup main badha di gayi
 In 1922 the length of the over was allowed to vary
 The Code of 1947 stipulated that according to the "prior agreement" between the captains, the length of an over would be six or eight balls
 marilibone cricket club cricket ke un niyamon kaa nirmaataa he jo is khel ko niyantrit karata he
 The rules were formulated with the intention of applying to all matches of two innings; ] Standard playing conditions for matches "

 in niyamon main imperial ikaayiyon ko usee rup main banaae rakhaa gaya he jaisaa ki unhen mul rup se nirdisht kiya gaya tha, lekin ab isamen metric roopantaran bhi shaamil hai
 The rules are organized into a role, a preface, forty-two laws, and four appendices
 bhoomika marilibone cricket club or niyamon ke itihaas se sambandhit he
 The preface is a new combination and relates to the "spirit of the game"; It was started in an attempt to curb the increasing trends of irresponsible conduct

 niyam 12: pari
 khel se pehle timen is baat par sahamat hoti hai ki kya ise ek pari yaa do pariyon main samaapt hona chahie or kya donon main se ek yaa donon paariyaan samay or overon ke hisaab se simit hongi
 vyaavhaarik rup se in faislon ko khel-purv samjhaute kii bajaay pratiyogita viniyamon dwaara nirdhaarit kiye jane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 In two-innings games both sides bat in turn until forced to follow-on
 sabhi ballebaajon ke out ho jane ke baad ek pari samaapt ho jaati he, agar koi anya ballebaaj khilne ke liye feet nahin hota he to pari ghoshit kar di jaati he yaa ballebaaji captain dwaara iskaa adhikaar kho diya jaataa he yaa jab koi sahamat samay yaa over kii seemaa puri ho jaati he
 The captain who wins a coin toss decides to bat or bowl first
 niyam 13: follow-on
 do pariyon ke match main agar baad main ballebaaji karne vaali team pehle ballebaaji karne vaali team kii tulana main bahut hi kam ran banaati he, to pehle ballebaaji karne vaali team apni vipakshi team ko tatkaal phir se ballebaaji karne par majaboor kar sakati he
 The team forcing a follow-on takes the risk of not batting again and thus creates an opportunity for victory
 paanch yaa usase adhik dinon ke khel ke liye pehle ballebaaji karne vaali team ko follow-on lagu karne ke liye kam se kam 200 ran se aage hona chahie; teen yaa chaar-din ke khel ke liye ise 150 ran; do-din ke khel ke liye 100 ran; ek-divasiy match ke liye 75 ran hona chahie
 The length of the game is actually determined by the number of days left of the game remaining from the time the game began
 niyam 14: pari kii ghoshnaa karnaa or adhikaar saunpna ballebaaji karne vaali team kaa captain gend ke bekaar ho jane par kisi bhi samay ek pari ke ant kii ghoshnaa kar saktaa he
 He can also delegate possession before his innings begins
 niyam 15: antaraal
 prayek din ke khel ke bich main antaraal hote hai, pariyon ke bich main ek das-minute kaa antaraal or dopaher kaa bhojan, chaay or drinks ke antaraal
 antaraalon ke samay or inaki lambaai par sahmati match shuru hone ke pehle bana lee jaani chahie
 Provisions also exist for changing intervals and lengths of intervals under special circumstances, most notably the provision that if nine wickets have fallen, the tea interval is delayed before the fall of the next wicket and 30 minutes after it
 goes
 niyam 16: khel kii shuruyaat; khel kii samaapti
 ek antaraal ke baad khel kii shuruyaat ampire dwaara "khilne" ke kol se hoti he or ek satr kaa ant "samay" dwaara hota he
 The final hour of a match consists of at least 20 overs, where some time is extended to include 20 overs if needed
 niyam 17: maidan par abhyaas
 din kaa khel shuru hone se pehle or din kaa khel samaapt ho jane ke baad ko chhodkar pich par ballebaaji yaa gendbaaji kaa koi abhyaas nahin ho saktaa he
 Bowlers can only test the run-up if the umpires believe that this will not waste any time
 iske baad niyam is baat par charchaa karte hai ki ran kaise banaae ja sakate hai or kaise ek team duusari team ko maat de sakati he
 Rule 18: scoring runs
 Runs are made when two batsmen run to each other's ends on the pitch
 ek gend se kai ran banaae ja sakate hai
 Rule 19: Boundary
 The boundary is marked around the edge of the playground
 jab kisi gend ko is boundry ke bheetar yaa iske paar maaraa jaataa he to chaar ran banate hai yaa agar gend ne boundry ko paar karne se pehle jameen ko nahin chuaa he to chah ran banate hai
 Rule 20: Lost Ball
 The fielding team may demand a "lost ball" if a ball is lost in the game or cannot be recovered
 ballebaaji karne vaali kisi bhi team panelti ran ko apane paas rakhti he or chah ran se zyada banaati he or ranon kii vah sankhya jo vastav main daud lagaakar puri kii jaati he
 Rule 21: Results
 The team that scores more runs becomes the winner of the match
 agar donon timen ek baraabar sankhya main ran banaati he to match baraabar ho jaataa he
 However, the match can go beyond the deadline before all the innings can be completed
 In such a situation the match becomes equal
 niyam 22: over
 ek over main wide or no-ball ko chhodkar chah gendon kii gendbaaji hoti he
 Over overs are bowled from opposite ends of the pitch
 ek gendbaaj lagaataar do over kii gendbaaji nahin bhi kar saktaa he
 Law 23: Dead Ball
 The ball comes into play when the bowler starts his run and it becomes useless when the ball ends all activity
 ek baar jab gend bekaar ho jaataa he to koi bhi ran nahin banaaya ja saktaa he or kisi bhi ballebaaj ko out nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The ball becomes useless for several reasons, most commonly when a batsman is out, when a four is hit or when the ball eventually reaches the bowler or wicketkeeper
 niyam 24: no-ball
 koi gend kai kaarnon se ek no ball ho saktaa he: agar gendbaaj galat sthaan se gendbaaji karata he; yaa agar gend phenkane ke dauraan vah apni kohni ko sidhaa kar letaa he; yaa agar gendbaaji khatarnaak hoti he; yaa agar gend do se adhik baar bouns karti he yaa ballebaaj tak pahunchane se pehle jameen ke saath ghistati he; yaa agar kshetrarakshak avaidh sthanon par khadey hai
 a no-ball adds an extra run to the batting team's score in addition to the other runs scored on it and the batsman is dismissed either through the run-out, or by handling the ball, hitting the ball twice, or on the field
 Cannot be dismissed from any no-ball except to interrupt
 niyam 25: wide ball ampire kisi gend ko "wide" qaraar detaa he agar unki raay main ballebaaj ke paas us gend se ran banane kaa ek uchit mauka nahin mila tha
 a ball is called wide when the bowler throws a bouncer that goes over the batsman's head
 ek wide gend par banaae gaye kisi bhi anya ran ke alaava yah ballebaaji team ke score main ek atirikt ran or jod detaa he or ballebaaj ko ek wide gend par out nahin kiya ja saktaa he sivaay iske ki use ran out yaa trump out nahin kar diya jaae yaa vah gend kii handlling ke jariye, apane wicket ko maar dene, yaa field ko baadhit karne par out naa ho jaae
 Law 26: Bye and leg bye
 If a ball that is not a no-ball or wide passes in front of the striker and runs are scored then it is called a bye run
 agar koi gend jo ek no ball nahin he vah striker ko lagati he lekin balle ko nahin lagati or us par ran banaae jate hai to unhen leg by ran kaha jaataa he
 However leg-by runs cannot be scored if the striker neither tries to apply a stroke nor tries to avoid being killed
 by or leg by ranon ko team ke ranon main joda jaataa he lekin ballebaaj ke kul ranon main nahin
 Rules 27 to 29 refer to the major procedures that describe how a batsman can be dismissed
 niyam 27: apil
 agar kshetrarakshakon kaa maananaa he ki ballebaaj out he to ve ampire se puch sakate hai "haau ij dait? ", aam taur par agali gend phenkane se pehle, donon haathon ko upar uthaate hue joardaar dhang se chillaakar aisa kiya ja saktaa he
 The umpire then decides whether the batsman is out or not
 sakhti se kaha jaataa he, kshetrarakshan paksh ko bold kiye jane jaise spasht maamalon sahit sabhi prakaar se out karne kii apil kerani chahie
 However, a batsman who is apparently out will normally leave the pitch without waiting for an appeal or an umpire's decision
 niyam 28: wicket neeche he
 There are several ways to get out when the wicket is dropped
 iskaa matlab yah he ki wicket ko gend se maaraa gaya he, yaa ballebaaj yaa vah haath jisamen kshetrarakshak gend ko pakade hue hai vah wicket par lagi he or kam se kam ek gilli gira di gayi he
 Rule 29: The batsman is out of his place
 ballebaaj ran out yaa stempd out ho saktaa he agar vah apane sthaan se baahar he
 The batsman is in his place, but if he or some part of his bat is on the ground behind the popping crease
 agar wicket ko neeche giraae jate samay donon ballebaaj pich ke bich main hai to jo ballebaaj us chor ke kareeb he vah out ho jaataa he
 Rules 30 to 39 discuss various ways by which a batsman can be dismissed
 in 10 tareekon ke alaava ballebaaj ritair hokar baahar ja saktaa he
 This provision is in Rule 2
 inamen se kaich out aam taur par sabase saamaanya tarika he jiske baad bold out, leg bifor wicket, ran out or stempd out kaa number aata he
 Other forms of getting out are very rare
 niyam 30: bold
 ek ballebaaj us sthiti main out hota he agar gendbaaj dwaara phenki gayi ek gend uske wicket ko neeche gira detii he
 It is irrelevant that the ball has touched the bat, glove or any part of the batsman before proceeding to bring the wicket down, although it may not have touched another player or umpire before doing so
 niyam 31: timed time
 ek nae aane vaale ballebaaj ko nivartmaan ballebaaj ke out hone ke 3 minute ke bheetar gend kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie, anyathaa aane vaala ballebaaj out ho jayega
 Rule 32: Catch out
 If a ball hits the bat or the hand holding the bat and is then caught by the opposition player within the field of play before the ball bounces, the batsman is out
 niyam 33: gend ko handle kiya janaa
 agar koi ballebaaj vipakshi team kii sahmati ke bina jaan-boojhkar ek aise ball ko ek haath se handle karata he jo balle ko nahin chooti he to vah out ho jaataa he
 Law 34: Hit the ball twice
 If a batsman hits the ball twice for the purpose of saving your wicket or with the consent of the opposition team, then he is out
 niyam 35: hit wicket
 agar gendbaaj apni gend phenkane ke kshetra main pravesh kar letaa he or jab gend khel ke bich main hoti he, aise main koi ballebaaj apane balle yaa apane sharir se wicket ko neeche gira detaa he to vah out he
 The striker is also dismissed as a hit wicket in the event that he drops his wicket off his bat or his body while running for the first run
 "sharir" main kapade or ballebaaj ke upkaran bhi shaamil hai
 Law 36: Leg before wicket
 If the ball hits the batsman without hitting the bat first, but if the batsman is not there, then that ball will hit the wicket and if the ball does not pitch on the leg side of the wicket then the batsman will be out
 However, the ball is not out if the batsman feels outside the line of off-stump and an attempt was made by the batsman to play a stroke
 niyam 37: field ko baadhit karnaa agar koi ballebaaj jaanboojhkar shabd yaa gatividhi se vipakshi team ko baadhit karata he to vah out he
 Law 38: Run out
 a batsman is out when any part of his bat or player falls behind the popping crease at any point during the ball's game and his wicket is clearly dropped by the opposition team
 niyam 39: stempd
 ek ballebaaj us sthiti main out ho jaataa he jab ballebaaj apni krij se baahar he or ran lene kii koshish nahin kar rahaa he or wicket-keeper wicket ko neeche gira detaa he
 Law 40: Wicket-keeper
 The wicket-keeper is the designated player from the bowling team who is authorized to stand behind the batsman's stumps
 vah apni team kaa ek maatr khilaadi he jise dastaane or bahari leg guard pahanane kii anumati di gayi he
 Rule 41: Fielder
 All eleven cricketers on the bowling side are fielders
 kshetrarakshakon ko gend pakadaney ke liye, ranon or chaukon ko rokane ke liye or gend ko kaich kar yaa ran out ke rup main ballebaaj ko out karne ke liye maidan par tainaat kiya jaataa he
 Rule 42: Fair and unfair game
 niyam ke paanch parishisht is prakaar hai: Mamta Shankar is an Indian actress
 vah bengali cinema main unke kaam ke liye jane jate hai
 He was born on 7 January 1955 to dancers Uday Shankar and Amala Shankar
 vah pandit ravi shankar ji kii bhatiji thim
 And his brother Anand Shankar was an indo-western fusion musician
 unhone sathyajith re, mrinal sen, rituparna ghosh, buddhadev dasgupta or gautam ghosh jaise nirdeshkon kii filmon main abhinay kiya he
 Apart from being an actress, she is a dancer and choreographer
 mamata shankar ne 1976 main mrinal sen dwaara nirdeshit film mrugayaaya ke saath apane karrier kii shuruyaat kii or us film ne varsh ke liye sarvshereshth feechar film kaa rashtriya film puraskaar bhi jeeta
 In 1986, Mamta Shankar ran a Mamta Shankar Dance Company - Udyan which travels widely across the world, including the 'mamta Shankar Ballet Troupe'
 buddhi vah maansik shakti he jo vastuon evam tathyon ko samajhane, unamem aapasi sambandh khojane tathaa tarkpurna gyaan praapt karne main sahaayak hoti he
 It is different from 'spirit' and conscience
 buddhi hi manushya ko naveen paristhitiyon ko thik se samajhane or uske saath anukulit hone main sahaayta karti he
 Wisdom can also be understood as 'the ability to process information'
 pracheen kaal se hi buddhi gyanatmak kriyaaon main charchaa kaa vishay rahaa he
 It is said that 'buddhayasya balantasya' means one who has intelligence, is strong
 buddhi ke kaaran hi maanav anya praaniyon se shreshth mana jaataa he
 Wisdom has also been a topic of discussion in the field of psychology
 hajaaron varsh purv se hi vyaktiyon ko buddhi ke aadhaar par alag-alag virgon main baanta gaya
 Some people are called intelligent, some are of low intelligence, some are of dumb intellect and some are called root intelligence
 parantu buddhi ke swaroop ko samajhnaa bada kathin he
 Differences have been going on in the form of intellect since ancient times and even today, for psychologists and academics, intellect remains a subject of debate
 19veen sadi ke uttararddh se bhi buddhi ke swaroop ko samajhane hetu manovaigyanikon ne prayaas prarambh kiye parantu ve bhi isamen safal nahin hue tathaa buddhi kii sarvasammat paribhaasha na de sake
 Even today, there is a disparity in the views of psychologists regarding the nature of intelligence
 alag-alag manovaigyanikon ne buddhi ke swaroop ko alag-alag dhang se paribhaashit kiya
 Psychologists have put the definitions of intelligence into three classes - in teen virgon ke antargat buddhi ko jis tarah paribhaashit kiya gaya unka ullekh is prakaar he- Psychologists such as Terman, Ambigas, Stout, Burt Gaulton Stern, etc
, who hold this type of ideology
 in manovaigyanikon ke anusaar buddhi vyakti kii saamaanya yogyata he, jo uski har kriya main paayi jaati he
 These psychologists have presented the definition of intelligence as- atah terman ke anusaar buddhi samasya ko hal karne kii yogyata he
 The name of Stanford Binay is particularly notable among those who believe in this type of ideology
 bine ke anusaar, buddhi tark, nirnay evam aatm aalochan kii yogyata evam kshamta he
 Under the definitions of this class of intelligence, psychologists have termed the sum of various types of special abilities as intelligence
 in vichaaron ko maanane vaale tharnadike, tharston, thomson, vesler tathaa stodard hai
 situations
) economy adaptations to a goal social value and commergence of originals under such conditions that demand aconcentration of energy and resistance to emotional forces
) The nature of the intellect and the principles of intelligence - both reveal ideas about the subject of intelligence, but still the differences between them are visible
 buddhi ke siddhanth uski sanrachana ko spasht karte hai jabaki swaroop uske kaaryon par prakaash daalate hai
 Since the first decade of the last century, psychologists of different countries grew interested in how the structure of intelligence is and what factors are involved in it
 inhen prashnon ke parinaam swaroop vibhinn karkon ke aadhaar par buddhi kii sanrachana kii vyakhya hone lagi
 Psychologists like Thorston, Thorndike, Thomson etc
 of America expressed their views on the 'nature of intellect' on the basis of factors
 isi tarah france main alfred bine, britain main spirmen ne bhi buddhi ke swaroop ke bare main apane vichaar prastut kiye
 This theory was formulated by the French psychologist Alfred Binay in 1911 and supported by the American psychologist Terman and the German psychologist Ambigas
 is siddhanth ke anusaar buddhi vah shakti he jo samast maansik kaaryon ko prabhavit karti he
 Followers of this theory have considered intelligence as a force affecting all mental functions
 unhone yah bhi mana he ki buddhi samgr rup vaali hoti he or vyakti ko ek vishesh kaary karne main agrasit karti he
 It is a monolithic clause that cannot be divided
 is siddhanth ke anusaar yadi vyakti kisi ek vishesh kshetra main nipun he to vah anya kshetron main bhi nipun rahegaa
 Keeping this same working principle, Binay considered intelligence to be the ability to interpret and decide
 terman ne ise vichaar karne kii yogyata mana he tathaa stern ne ise naveen paristhitiyon ke saath samaayojan karne kii yogyata ke rup main mana he
 The originator of this theory is the famous psychologist Spear Men of Britain
 unhone apane prayogtmak adhyayanon tathaa anubhavon ke aadhaar par buddhi ke is dwi-tatv siddhanth kaa pratipaadan kiya
 According to him, intelligence is in the form of two powers or there are two factors in the structure of intelligence
 inamen se ek ko unhone 'saamaanya buddhi' tathaa duusare kaarak ko 'vishisht buddhi' kaha he
 By common factor, he implies that all individuals have a common ability to act
 atah prayek vyakti kuch seemaa tak pratyekkarya kar saktaa he
 These tasks are only due to his general intelligence
 saamaanya kaarak vyakti kii sampoorn maansik evam bauddhik kriyaaon main paaya jaataa he parantu yah vibhinn matraaon main hota he
 This common factor of intelligence is congenital and points individuals towards success
 vyakti kii vishesh kriyaayein buddhi ke ek vishesh kaarak dwaara hoti he
 This factor is called the specific factor of intelligence
 ek prakaar kii vishisht kriya main buddhi kaa ek vishisht kaarak kaary karata he to duusari kriya main doosraa vishisht kaarak
 Therefore, different types of specific actions require different types of specific factors
 ye vishisht kaarak bhinn-bhinn vyaktiyon main bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke hote hai
 For this reason individual differences are found
 buddhi ke saamaanya kaarak janmajaat hote hai jabaki vishisht kaarak adhikanshtah arjeet hote hai
 According to this two-factor theory of intelligence, common factors of intelligence work in all types of mental activity, while specific factors are used independently in specific mental activities
 vyakti ke ek hi kriya main ek yaa kai vishisht karkon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 But in every mental activity, along with specific factors related to that action, general factors are also necessary
 jaise- saamaanya vigyaan, saamaajik adhyayan, darshan evam shaastra adhyayan jaise vishyon ko jaanane or samajhane ke liye saamaanya kaarak mahatvapurn samajhe jate hai vahiin yantric, hastkala, kala, sangeet kala jaise vishisht vishyon ko jaanane ore samajhane ke liye vishisht karkon kii pramukh rup se aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is clear from this that to learn a particular subject or art, it is very important to have both factors
 spirmen ne san 1904 main apane purv buddhi ke dvikarak siddhanth main sanshodhan karte hue ek kaarak or jodakar buddhi ke trikaarak siddhanth kaa pratipaadan kiya
 The third factor of intelligence that he added to his theory is what he called the 'group factor'
 atah buddhi ke is siddhanth main teen kaarak- Have been included
 spirmen ke vichaar main saamaanya tathaa vishisht karkon ke atirikt samooh kaarak bhi samast maansik kriyaaon main saath rahata he
 Some special abilities like mechanical ability, numerical ability, lexical ability, musical ability, memory ability, logical ability and intellectual ability etc
 Group factors also play a special role
 samooh kaarak swayan apane aap main koi swatantra astitv nahin rakhata balki vibhinn vishisht karkon tathaa saamaanya kaarak ke mishran se yah apana samooh banaata he
 That is why it is called group factor
 manovaigyanikon ke anusaar is siddhanth main kisi prakaar kii naveenta nahin he
 Psychologists like Thorndike have criticized the theory that the group factor is not a new factor, but rather a mixture of general and specific factors
 tharnadike ne apane siddhanth main buddhi ko vibhinn karkon kaa mishran mana he
 Which has many merits
 unke anusaar kisi bhi maansik kaary ke liye, vibhinn kaarak ek saath milakar kaary karte hai
 Thorndike criticized the 'general factors' presented in earlier theories and mentioned the basic factors and common factors in their theory instead of the common factors
 mul karkon main mul maansik yogyataon ko sammilit kiya he
 These qualifications are such as - verbal ability, numerical ability, mechanical ability, memory ability, logical ability and speech ability etc
 unke anusaar ye yogyataayen vyakti ke samast maansik kaaryon ko prabhavit karti he
 Thorndike also believes that every person has some specific qualification
 parantu unka yah bhi maananaa he ki vyakti kii ek vishay kii yogyata se duusare vishay main yogyata kaa anumaan lagaana kathin he
 For example, if a person is proficient in mechanical art, it is not necessary that he will also be proficient in music
 unke anusaar jab do maansik kriyaaon ke pratipaadan main yadi dhanatmak sahasambandh paaya jaataa he to uskaa arthi vyakti main sarvanisht kaarak bhi hai
 The amount of these common factors can be known by the amount of correlation
 tharston ke samooh kaarak siddhanth ke anusaar buddhi na to saamaanya karkon kaa pradarshan he na hi vibhinn vishisht karkon kaa, apitu isamen kuchisi nishchit maansik kriyaayein hoti hai jo saamaanya rup se mul karkon main sammilit hoti he
 These mental actions form groups that provide psychological and functional unity
 tharston ne apane siddhanth ko kaarak vishleshan ke aadhaar par prastut kiya
 According to him, the structure of intelligence is made up of a set of fundamental factors
 do yaa adhik mul kaarak milakar ek samooh kaa nirmaan kar lete hai jo vyakti ke kisi kshetra main uski buddhi kaa pradarshan karte hai
 Among these fundamental factors, he considered numerical ability, perceptibility, lexical ability, decimal ability, word fluency, reasoning power and memory power
 tharston ne yah spasht kiya ki buddhi kai prakaar kii yogyataon kaa mishran he jo vibhinn samoohon main pai jaati he
 According to him, mental abilities are functionally independent, yet when they work in a group, there is a correlation or similarity between them
 kuch vishisht yogyataayen ek hi samooh kii hoti hai or unamem aapas main sah-sambandh paaya jaataa he
 Like Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Biological Physics and Chemistry etc
 in a group of science subjects
 isi prakaar sangeet kala ko pradarshit karne ke liye tabalaa, hormonium, sitar aadi bajaane main paraspar sah-sambandh rahata he
 Thomson presented the model theory of intelligence
 unke matanusaar vyakti kaa prayek kaary nishchit yogyataon kaa pratidarsh hota he
 In performing any particular task, a person selects some of his mental abilities as a model
 is siddhanth main unhone saamaanya karkon kii vyaavhaarikta ko mahatv diya he
 According to Thomson, the intellectual behavior of a person depends on many independent abilities, but only his model comes out while doing the examination
 remand ve
 kettl ne do prakaar kii saamaanya buddhi kaa varnan kiya he
 These are fluid and crystallized
 unke anusaar buddhi kii flud saamaanya yogyata vanshanukram karkon par nirbhar karti he jabaki crystallijd yogyata arjeet karkon ke rup main hoti he
 Fluid general ability is found mainly in tests involving culture, movement conditions and adaptability to new conditions
 crystallijd saamaanya yogyata arjeet saanskrithik uplabdhiyon, kaushaltaaon tathaa nai sthiti se sambandhit vaale pareekshanon main ek kaarak ke rup main maapi jaati he
 Fluid general ability can be taken as the hereditary divider of the body which is governed by biochemical reactions
 jabaki crystallijd saamaanya yogyata saamaajik adhigam evam paryaavaran prabhaavon se sanchalit hoti he
 According to Kettle Fluid is related to common sense inheritance and is innate while crystallized general intelligence is acquired
 bart evam varnan ne is siddhanth kaa pratipaadan kiya
 It is considered a new theory in the field of intellect theories
 is siddhanth main bart evam varnan ne maansik yogyataon ko kramik mahatv pradaan kiya he
 He distinguished mental abilities on two levels - saamaanya maansik yogyataon main bhi yogyataon ko unhone staron ke aadhaar par do vargon main vibhajit kiya
 In the first category, he has placed functional, mechanical and physical abilities
 is mukhya varg ko unhone k
m
 naam diya
 In the second group of qualifications, he has put literal, numerical and educational qualifications and in this group he v
ed
 Named
 antim str par unhone vishisht maansik yogyataon ko rakhaa jinka sambandh vibhinn gyanatmak kriyaaon se he
 The novelty of this theory and its special abilities have attracted the attention of many psychologists
 gilford tathaa uske sahyogiyon ne teen maansik yogyataon ke aadhaar par buddhi sanrachana kii vyakhya prastut kii
 This intelligence structure theory of Guilford is called the three-dimensional intellectual model
 unhone buddhi karkon ko teen shreniyon main baanta he, arthath maansik yogyataon ko teen vimaaon main baanta he
 These are kaarak vishleshan se buddhi kii ye teenon vimaayein paryaapt rup se bhinn he
 Apart from all this, there is a theory of intelligence which was propounded by 'howard Gardner', it is called polytheistic theory
 iske anusaar har insaan me alag prakaar kii buddhi hoti he,jaise koi sangeet me paarangat ho saktaa he to koi abhinay me to koi lekhan me,koi taarkik kshamta me aadi
 They have divided it into eight areas to explain this theory of intelligence which are as follows-1-linguistic-2-logical-mathematical-3-country-4-musical-5-physical-motion-sensitive-6-interpersonal-7-inter-person8-naturalist gardenar ne apni pustak "frames of mind: da theory of multiple intelligence" me ise kaaphi achche se vistaarpurvak bataaya he

 Matiram was a famous Brajbhasha poet of Hindi
 inke dwaara rachit "rasraj" or "lalit lalaam" naamak do granth hai; parantu idhar kuch adhik khojbin ke uparaant matiram ke naam se milane vaale aath granth praapt hue hai
 On the basis of the style and composition of these eight texts and the details related to them, it is clearly known that there were two poets named Matiram
 prasiddh matiram phulmanjari, rasraj, lalit lalaam or satsai ke rachayita the or sambhavat: duusare matiram ke dwaara rachit granth alankaar panchasika, chhandsar sangrah yaa vruttkaumudi, sahityasar or lakshanshringaar hai
 Matiram was born in 1617 in Tikvampur, located in Kanpur district of Uttar Pradesh
 ve acharya kavi chintamani tathaa bhushan ke bhai the
 It is mentioned in "vanshabhaskara" and "tajkirae Survey Azad Hind"
 bhushan ne apane ko kashyap gotreey kanyakubj treepathi ratnakar kaa putr bataaya he or charkhari naresh vikramaditya ke rajyakavi biharilal ne vikramsatsai kii tikaa raschandrika main apana parichay diya he jisase spasht he ki bhushan or biharilal ek hi gotra ke the or matiram unke parababa the, parnana nahin; anyathaa ve matiram se apana sambandh na jodakar apane samgotriy purvaj bhushan se apana sambandh adhik spasht karte
 That's why other Vatsagotriya Matirams are different from these Matirams
 matiram or bhushan kaa bhai bhai kaa sambandh tha, yah "lalit lalaam" or "shivaraj bhushan" main die gaye alankaaron ke samaan lakshanon se bhi spasht hota he
 Bhushan has taken the hesitant traits from Lalit Lalam

 His third book 'lalit Lalam' is a text of ornaments written in the shelter of Bundi Naresh Bhavsingh
 iskaa rachanakaal sanwat 1720 ke aasapaas mana jaataa he
 Characteristics in this book are based on Sanskrit texts called Chandralok, Kuvalayananda, but examples are their own
 isamen rasraj ke bhi kuch chand aae hai
 Instead of Rasraj's innocent sentiments, subtle imagination is evident in it
 matiram kii antim rachana 'satsai' he
 This compilation seems to have been done after Bihari Satsai around 1740 AD
 isaki rachana bhoop bhoganath ke liye kii gai thi

 According to this, the name of these Matiram's father was Vishwanath, Balabhadra of Pitamah and Giridhar of Prapitamah

 Tyson fought three battles in 1988
 On 22 January 1988, he faced Larry Holmes and defeated the former heavyweight champion by a fourth-round KO
 In 75 professional matches, Holmes had to go through a knockout defeat in this match
 In March, Tyson had a fight with contender Tony Tubbs in Tokyo, Japan, winning an easy win between promotion and marketing
 27 june 1988 ko, tyson ne maaikel spinks kaa saamana kiya
 Spinks, who took the heavyweight championship from Larry Holmes by a 15-round decision in 1985, did not lose his title in the ring, but was not recognized as a champion by major boxing organizations
 homes ne isse pehle IBF ko chhod kar baaki sabhi kitaab chhod die the, jise antat spinks se chin liya gaya jab usne gairi koni se ladane kaa chunaav kiya bajaay IBF ke awwal daavedaar tony takar se, chunki kone se mukaable ke rup main use adhik dhan praapt hua
 However, Spinks became the reigning champion after defeating Holmes, and many believed that he had a legitimate claim to be a true heavyweight champion
 vah muqabla, us samay, itihaas main sabase mahangaa muqabla tha or apekshaayen bahut adhik thim
 Boxing pundits were anticipating a huge battle of genres, with Tyson's aggressive inner fight paired with Spinks's accomplished outside fights and footsteps

 1988 ke uttarardh main tyson ne apane puraane trainer kevin runi ko nikaal diya, jis vyakti ko kai log di amato kii maut ke baad tyson ke hunar ko nikhaarane kaa shrey dete hai
 Without Rooney, Tyson's skills soon began to erode and he began to seek more of a box knockout, rather than using the combination that made him a star
 He also started hitting his head and ignored the first attack on the opponent's body
 In addition, he started losing his defense skills and jabbed and neglected to make his way inwards, he started moving directly towards the opponent
 In 1989 Tyson made only two bouts amidst personal turmoil
 He faced popular British boxer Frank Bruno in a fight in February, in which Bruno stunned Tyson at the end of the first round, although Tyson went on to knockout Bruno in the fifth round
 Tyson then knocked out Carl "the Truth" Williams in a round in July
 1989 main, tyson ko ohio main central state uniwarsity se human letters main doctoret kii ek maanad oopaadhi di gai
 By 1990, Tyson seemed to have lost direction and his personal life and training habits had gone haywire
 11 farvari 1990 ko ek ladaai main unhone tokyo main baster duglas ko nirvivaad championships kho di

 Tyson dropped Douglas to the ground in the eighth round with an uppercut, but Douglas managed to relieve himself strongly and smacked Tyson in the next two rounds
 Just 35 seconds into the 10th round, Douglas hit a brutal combination of hooks, which dropped Tyson onto the canvas for the first time in his career
 He was dismissed by referee Octavio Meran after counting
 purv main aparajit "dharti ke sabase bure aadmi" or yakeenan peshewar mukkebaaji main us samay ke sabase zyaada bhayakrant karne vaale boxr, tyson ke upar duglas kii nokout vijay ko aadhunik khel ke itihaas main sabase zyada chaunkaane vaale ulatpher ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 After the defeat, Tyson managed to beat Henry Tillman and Alex Stewart in their first two battles in the first round
 Tyson's victory over 1984 Olympic heavyweight gold medalist Tillman enabled Tyson to avenge his amateur defeat at the hands of Tillman early in his career
 These bouts formed an elimination match for another wager in the undisputed World Heavyweight Championship, which was taken by Evander Holyfield in the first defense of his title from Douglas
 tyson ne, jo # 1 daavedaar tha, 18 march 1991 ko las vegas main # 2 daavedaar donoven "reiser" ruddock kaa saamana kiya
 At the time, Ruddock was seen as the most dangerous heavyweight and was counted among the most hard-hitting heavyweight

 The match between Tyson and Holyfield was held in the autumn of 1991 for the undisputed championship

 tyson kii limosin main baithne ke baad, washington ne daawa kiya ki tyson ne uske saath kuch aapattijanak harakatein kii
 hotel ke kamare main aane ke baad, usne daawa kiya ki tyson ne use apane bistar par neeche gira diya or ruk jane kii uski apil ke baavjood balaatkaar kiya
 She later ran out of the room and asked Tyson's driver to take her back to her hotel
 Upon Fuller's retrial, Washington was forced to admit that he had several chances to leave Tyson's hotel room, but did not choose to do so
 fuller ne, purushon ko yon rup se bhadakaane kii washington ke itihaas kii bhi jaanch kii
 Washington's story was partially supported by testimony from Tyson's driver, Virginia Foster, who confirmed Desiri Washington's state of shock
 Also there was testimony from Dr
 Thomas Richardson, the emergency room doctor who examined Washington more than 24 hours after the incident and confirmed that Washington must have actually been raped
 fuller kii pratyaksh pariksha ke tahat, sakshi katghare se tyson ne daawa kiya ki sab kuch washington ke purna sahyog ke saath hua or unhone daawa kiya ki unhone uske saath jabardastee nahin kii
 lekin jab garrison ne unke saath jirah kiya to tyson ne washington ko gumraah karne ke daavon kaa khandan kiya or jor dekar kaha ki vah unke saath yon sambandh bananaa chaahati thi
 Due to the antagonistic and defensive answers to questions by Tyson during the cross-examination, it is believed that his behavior disliked him by the jury, whom he found to be animalistic and arrogant
 juri dwaara lagbhag 10 ghante kii charchaa ke baad, tyson ko balaatkaar ke aarope main 10 farvari 1992 ko doshi tehraaya gaya
 Under Indiana law, a defendant who has been convicted of a crime must begin his prison sentence immediately after the decision
 On March 26, he received a 10-year sentence, six years in prison and four in probation, and was released in March 1995 after serving a three-year sentence

 This brief battle of 89 seconds, in which mcnally broke down sharply in the face of Tyson, received criticism that Tyson's management erected "tomato Cain" for his return, an easily defeated and inept boxer
 unhone march 1996 main frank bruno se tisare daur main use nokout karte hue, aasaani se WBC kitaab jeet kar ek belt punah hasil kar lee 
 tyson ne us varsh sitambar main ek round main champion bruce celdan ko haraate hue WBA belt hasil kiya
 Seldon was severely criticized and mocked in the popular press for being piled only by punches that appeared to be harmless to Tyson in the fight
 tyson ne evander holifield ke khilaaf WBA kitaab ko bachaane kii koshish kii
 holifield apni vaapasi kii chauthi ladaai main tha, kyonki 1994 main maaikel moorer se apana championships haar jane ke baad vah sevanivrutt ho gaya tha
 It was said that Don King and others saw Holyfield as a hollow boxer, a former champion and a 34-year-old at the time of the fight, and a big downtrodden
 9 navambar 1996 ko, las vegas, nevada main tyson ne ek kitaabi mukaable main jise finali kaa naam diya gaya tha, holifield kaa saamana kiya
 Holyfield, considered "hollow" in a surprising turn of events, for which many announcers had virtually no hope, Tyson was defeated by TKO when referee Mitch Halpern stopped the bout in 11 rounds
 With this reversal, Holyfield created history by becoming the second man to win a heavyweight championship belt three times, besides Mohammed Ali

 tyson ko $30 million or holifield ko $35 million mili - jo 2007 tak kaa sabase adhik bhugtan vaala peshewar mukkebaaji bhugtan tha
 The match was bought by 1
99 million homes, creating a record pay-per-view purchase rate, which lasted until the May 5, 2007, De La hoya-mayweather boxing match
 aadhunik khelon main sheeghra hi sabase vivaadaaspad ghatnaon main se ek banane vaale, is mukaable ko tisare daur ke ant main roak diya gaya, kyonki tyson ko holifield ke donon kaan kaat lene ke baad ayogy ghoshit kar diya gaya

 lekin match ke dobaaraa shuru hone ke baad tyson ne phir vahi kiya; is baar tyson ko ayogy ghoshit kar diya gaya or holifield match jeet gaya
 He sliced so hard that a piece of Holyfield's right ear came out, which was found on the ring floor after the bout
 tyson ne baad main kaha ki yah unhone holifield dwaara bina penalty ke lagaataar headbat karne kii javaabi karrwai ke tahat kiya
 In the midst of confusion over ending the boxing and declaring the decision, a riot-like situation erupted in the arena and several people were injured in the scuffle
 us ghatana ke baad ke ek parinaam ke rup main, nevada state mukkebaaji ayog dwaara tyson ke $30-million ke bhugtan se $3 million ko tatkaal roak liya gaya

 Tyson's boxing license was revoked by a unanimous sound vote by the Nevada State Athletic Commission on July 9, 1997; He was fined US $ 3 million and ordered to pay the legal costs of the hearing
 chunki adhikansh rajya athlettic ayog, anya rajyon dwaara lagaae gaye pratibandhon kaa sammaan karte hai, isane tyson ko sanyukt rajya america main mukkebaaji karne main prabhavi dhang se asamarth bana diya

 During this time, Tyson was also an unofficial member of d-generation X
 resalmenia ke match main atithi enforcer banane ke liye tyson ko $3 million kaa bhugtan kiya gaya
 In January 1999, Tyson returned to the ring to fight South Africa's Francois Botha, another battle that ended in controversy
 While Botha initially held the fight, Tyson reportedly attempted to break Botha's arms during a tie-up and the two boxers were warned by the referee in this hot-tempered boxing
 Botha was ahead in points at all points and was confident of dusting Tyson
 phir bhi, tyson ne paanchaven daur main botha ko sidhe ek rhit-hand jad diya, jisase botha nokout ho gaya
 Legal problems struck Tyson once again
 On 6 February 1999, Tyson was sentenced to one year imprisonment, a fine of $ 5000 and two years of probation and 200 hours of community service for assaulting two motorcycle riders following a traffic accident on 31 August 1998

 As a result, the bout was declared a zero contest
