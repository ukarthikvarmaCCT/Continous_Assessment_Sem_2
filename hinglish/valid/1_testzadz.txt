shakti mossphate yaa 'power mossphate' vishesh prakaar ke mossphate hote hai jo apekshaakrit adhik vidyut shakti sambhaal sakate hai
 That is, they are capable of handling high voltage or high current or high voltage and current
 aijibiti, esasiaar aadi anya power-electranik yuktiyon kii apeksha inhen upyog main laane kaa mukhya laabh yah he ki inhen adhik aavriti par chaalu-band kiya ja saktaa he
 The higher the frequency at which the power circuits are run, the smaller the size of the inductance, transformer, capacitor etc
 shakti mossphate visheshtah kam voltata par kaam karnaa ho to power mossphate ke upyog se dakshata adhik milti he
 Higher voltage power mosses have higher current state resistance due to which their use leads to greater power loss and lower efficiency
 isi kaaran shakti mossphate kam voltata par sarvaadhik upyog kiya jane vaala switch he
 The method of working of Shakti Mossfat is the same as that of Mossfate working at low power
 jab san 1970 dashak ke aakhri dinon main isi nirmaan ke liye CMOS takanic kaa vikaas hua to mossphate kaa janm hua
 When the first Shakti Mosphates were developed in the early 1980s, many structures were tried
 kintu unamem se adhikansh ko ab tyaag diya gaya he or vertical diphyujd moss sarvaadhik upyukt sanrachana siddh hui he
 The transverse cut of vdmoss is shown in the front image
 isse is yukti kii urdhvadharata dekhi ja sakati he
 It is noticeable that its 'source' electrode is located above the drain, due to which current will flow in it in the vertical direction
 sahi kahen to shakti mosspheton kii sanrachana 'latural mosspheton' se alag hoti he
 The structure of the Shakti Mossfet is vertical rather than a 'planner'
 vidyut shakti vitaran ke sandarbh main basbaar kisi vidyut chaalak dhaatu se bani chad yaa pattee ko kehete hai jiskaa upyog ucch dhara pravaahit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 They are used to connect high voltage devices to the electrical switchyard

 This allows them to cool down and to connect other busbars or cables from any place of theirs
 cabel Busbar champoo shravy kavy kaa ek bhed he, arthath gadhy-padya ke mishrit kavy ko champoo kehete hai
 The prose and poetry mixed poetry is called "champu"
 kavy kii is vidha kaa ullekh sahityashastra ke pracheen aacharyon- bhamah, dandi, vaaman aadi ne nahin kiya he
 Thus, the use of prose Padmayya style is also found in Vedic literature, Buddhist Jataka, Jatakamala etc
 in very ancient literature
 champookavy parampara kaa prarambh hamen atharv veda se praapt hota he
 Prakrit Kavya, named Champu, was not composed before the tenth century
 trivikram bhatta dwaara rachit 'nalchampu', jo dasvin sadi ke prarambh kii rachana he, champoo kaa prasiddh udhaaharan he
 Apart from this, the Yashashtilak composed by Somdev Suri, Bhojraj's Champu Ramayana, the poet Karnapuri's Anandavrindavan, Gopal Champu, Neelkanth Champu and Champu are examples of India from tenth to seventeenth century
 yah kavy rup adhik lokapriy na ho sakaa or na hi kavyashastra main uski vishesh manyata hui
 Yashodhara in Hindi is called champu-kavya, because both prose-verse has been used in it

 But Champurichayas have given importance to their free will and personal interest in the combination of both, by not paying special attention to this psychological feature
 gadhy-padya kaa sanmishran sanskrit sahitya main pracheen he, parantu kavyastylee main nibaddh, "champu" kii sangya kaa adhikari gadhy-padya kaa samanjas mishran utana pracheen nahin mana ja saktaa
 The compositions of prose-verse are available in Krishna Yajurvedic codes
 pali jaatakon main bhi gadhy main kathanak tathaa padya main mul sutratmak sanketon kii uplabdhi avashya hoti he
 But being devoid of poetry, we cannot consider them as "champu" in any way
 harishen rachit samudragupta kii prayagprashasti tathaa buddha kavi yanshur pranit jatakamala champu ke aadim rup maane ja sakate hai, kyonki pehle main samudragupta kii digvijay tathaa duusare main 34 jataka vishuddh kavyastylee kaa aashray lekar alankrita gadhy padya main varnit hai
 Champu seems to have been an enlarged form of prose poetry and that is why this poetic form emerged around the eternal ninth century of the golden age of prose poetry
 champu kavy kaa pratham nidarshan trivikram bhatta kaa nalchampu he jisamen champu kaa vaishishty sphutatya udbhasith hota he
 The trivikram composed this dainty champu while staying in the shelter of Indraj, the son of King Jagatuga and Lakshmi, the grandson of King Krishna of the south
 indraraj kaa rajbhishek visan 972 main hua tha or unke ashrith hone se kavi kaa bhi vahi samay he dasham shatee kaa purvardh

 champu ke antim teen uchhravaason main jaindharm ke siddhaton kaa vistrut vivaran prastut kar kavi ne in siddhanton kaa paryaapt prachaar prastaar kiya he
 The description of the various religious, economic and social subjects of that era in the book is indicative of the comprehensive and multi-faceted worship of Somprabhasuri
 ram tathaa krishna ke charit kaa avlamban kar anek pratibhashali kaviyon ne apni pratibha kaa ruchir pradarshan kiya he
 Among such champu poems, Bhojraj's Ramayana Champu, Anantabhatta's "bharat Champu", Shesh Krishna's "parijataharan Champu" are quite famous
 bhojraj ne ramayana champu kii rachana kiskindha cond tak hi kii thi, jisaki purti lakshmana bhatta ne "yukand" kii tathaa venkatraj ne "uttar cond" kii rachana kar kii thi
 Like Jain poets, Chaitanya Mataavalambi Vaishnava poets adopted this fine poetry medium with great success to spread their principles
 bhagwaan shrikrishna kii lalaam lilaon kaa prasang aisa hi sundar avasar he jab in kaviyon ne apni aloksaamanya pratibha kaa prasad apane champu kaavyon ke dwaara bhakt pathakon ke saamne prastut kiya
 Anandavrindavan Champu of Poet Karnapur, and Gopalchampu of Jeeva Goswami are extremely successful poets in terms of Saras poetry

 Eminent author Mitra Mishra of "veeramitrodaya", "anandakand Champu" adds an interesting series to Krishnaprakum champs
 dakshin bharat main bhi champukavyon kii lokapriyata kam na thi
 Neelkanth Dixit's "neelkanthvijay Champu" is about Samudramanthan
 shri vaishnav venkatadhvari ke "vishvagunadarsh champu" kii rachana anya champuon se is baat main vishisht he ki isamen bharat ke naanaa tirtho, dharmo tathaa shastragyon main dosha tathaa gunon kaa udghaatan badi maarmikata se ek saath kiya gaya he
 This is a particularly popular poem

 Thus, despite being a popular medium for many centuries for the manifestation of sentiments in Sanskrit literature, Champu poetry could not be stagnant in North Indian language literature
 drawidi bhashaa ke sahitya main samanyat:, kerali tathaa andhra sahitya main visheshat:, champu kavy aaj bhi lokapriy he jiske pranyan kii ore kavijanon kaa dhyaan purnat: aakrisht he

 The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the action sequences and the original theme, while its seriousness, excessive use of CGI and speed were heavily criticized
 san 1818, kishor abraham linkan indiana main apane mata-pita ke saath rahata he, nancy or thomas, joki donon jaik barts ke kheton main paudharopan kaa kaam karte the
 At the same time, Lincoln is forced to intervene in the case by witnessing the beating of his african-american friend, William Janson, by a slave seller
 lihaaja apane hi bete ke is karatuuton se, thomas ko barkhaast kar diya jaataa he
 That same night, Lincoln sees Bart sneaking up at his house, prancing his mother
 nancy lagbhag usee roj bimaar pad jaati he, jiske tatkaal baad unka dehanth ho jaataa he
 Thomas tells the little Lincoln that Bart has poisoned his mother, but he is also sworn that he will not take revenge for her death
 nau saal baad, apane pita kii maut ke baad, badale ko lekar baichaiyn linkan apni kasam tod daalata he, or dak main intjaar karte hue bart par hamalaa karata he, par bart chunki ek pishaach he wo us par fouran hi haaavee ho jaataa he
 However, Bart kills him, Lincoln's life saves another stranger, Henry Sturges
 subah uski behoshee henry ke ghar par khulti he, or jahaan sterges bataata he pishaach is sadi main apane astitv kii nai duniya bananaa chaahate hai or iske badale main vah linkan ko vaimpire hunter banane kaa nyauta detaa he
 Lincoln gives his approval and, while learning the tricks of the hunt for a decade, travels through Springfield, Illinois, competing with vampires in several cities of the United Nations with his mad silver-studded ax
 sterges ke mutabik america main is pashvik beemaari failaane kaa mukhya jad adam naam kaa vah pracheen pishaach hi he jo new orlins sthit khetihar zameenon kaa maalik, apni bahan, vadama ke saath rahata he
 Sturges tells Lincoln about the only weaknesses of the vampires, which is silver, and for this he gives a silver pocket watch as a gift and hopes to succeed in this campaign

 Although Sturges warned her not to have any relationship, Abraham's meeting with Mary Todd, the two fall in love with each other, despite their engagement with someone else Stephen A
 Being with Douglas, she could not express it
 linkan is dauraan barts ko dhundhakar maar daalata he jabatak kii use mairi kaa pataa nahin chalata
 Before dying, Bartes reveals a mystery about Sturgess being a vampire
 linkan jald hi sterges se saamana karata he, vah apane pishaach banane kii vajah bataata he, ki ek sadi pehle use or uski bivi par adam ne hamalaa kiya or kaat khaaya
 Since Henry's wife's soul was clean, the bite killed him, but he became a vampire due to Sturges' soul degenerating and giving Adam and the other vampires harm
 
 Sturges now learns the tricks of a vampire hunter, hoping that he will destroy Adam
 vahiin is niraashaa ke baad, linkan yah muhim chhodane kaa man bana letaa he
 Despite this, Adam continues his activities and leads Johnson to lay a trap to trap Lincoln on the plantation
 adam tab linkan ko dhar letaa he or apni jamaat main shaamil karne kii koshish karata he, yahaan tak kii sanyukt raashtra ko ek murda raashtra banane kaa shadyantr bhi jaahir karata he

 Sturges warns Lincoln that the slavery business is handled by the same vampire, who is a slave to those vampires, if Lincoln interferes, the vampires will avenge him

 On the train, Adam and Wadoma set fire to the path before arriving at their destination, and attack Lincoln, Sturges and Johnson
 ladaai dauraan, marane se pehle speed, adam ko bataata he ki train par sirf pathar laden hai
 Lincoln reveals that Speed has tricked Adam into tricking him even at his behest
 linkan apni chaandi kii ghadi se adam ko rokane kii koshish kar, use maar daalata he, or train ke tabah hone se pehle batch nikalate hai
 Meanwhile, Mary and other ex-slaves transport all the silver via the underground railway route to Gettysburg

 The names of some stars of this constellation are as follows - naag panchami hinduon kaa ek pramukh tyohaar he
 According to Hindu Panchang, Panchami of Shukla Paksha of Sawan month is celebrated as Nag Panchami
 is din naag devtaa yaa sarp kii puja kii jaati he or unhen doodh se snaan karaayaa jaataa he
 But at some places, the tradition of feeding has gone on
 naag ko doodh pilaane se pachan nahin ho paane yaa pratyurjata se unki mrityu ho jaati he
 In the scriptures, Nagas have been asked not to give milk but to bathe with milk
 nagpanchami ke hi din anekon gaanv va kasbon main kushti kaa aayojan hota he jisamen aasapaas ke pahalwaan bhaag lete hai
 On this day, animals like cows, bulls etc
 are taken to the river, pond and bathed
 is din ashtnaagon kii puja kii jaati he
 - hindu samskruti ne pashu-pakshi, vriksh-vanaspati sabake saath athmiya sambandh jodne kaa praytn kiya he
 We have cow worship here
 kai bahanen kokila-vrath karti hai
 It is such a fast if the cuckoo is seen or its food is on the ear
 hamaare yahan vrishabhotsav ke din bail kaa pujan kiya jaataa he
 In a fast like vat-savitri, Banyan is worshiped, but when we worship Nag on a day like Nag Panchami, then the uniqueness of our culture reaches its culmination
 gaay, bail, koyal ityadi kaa pujan karke unke saath atmiyata saadhane kaa ham praytn karte hai, kyonki ve upyogi hai
 But what is the use of our snake, on the contrary, if cut, then without knowing it, do not remain
 ham sab usase darate hai
 Many people believe that this fear of Nag may have started Nagpuja, but this belief does not seem to be compatible with our culture
 naag ko dev ke rup main sweekaar karne main aaryon ke hriday kii vishalata kaa hamen darshan hota he
 The Aryans had to come in contact with many groups worshiping different people, proceeding with this roar
 vedon ke prabhavi vichaar unke paas pahunchaane ke liye aaryon ko atyadhik parishram karnaa padaa
 If the dispute arising due to the difference in worship method to various groups is removed, then the human will only accept the brilliant and grand ideas of the Vedas, on which the Aryans had unwavering devotion
 isko safal banane ke liye aaryon ne alag-alag punjon main chalati vibhinn devataaon kii puja ko sweekaar kiya or alag-alag punjon ko unhone aatmsaat karke apane main mila liya
 It is only because of accepting these various pujas that we would have received Nagpuja, it seems
 bharat desh krishipradhan desh tha or he
 The snake protects the fields, so it is called Kshetrapala
 jeev-jantu, chuuhe aadi jo fasal ko nuksaan karne vaale tatv hai, unka naash karke saanp hamaare kheton ko harabhra rakhata he
 The snake also gives us many silent messages
 saanp ke gun dekhne kii hamaare paas gungrahi or shubhagrahi drushti honi chahie
 Lord Dattatreya had such an auspicious vision, that's why he got to learn something from everything
 saanp saamanyatya kisi ko akaaran nahin katata
 He stings only those who harass him or tease him
 saanp bhi prabhu kaa sarjan he, vah yadi nuksaan kiye bina saralata se jaataa ho, yaa nirupadravi banakar jeeta ho to use maarane kaa hamen koi adhikaar nahin he
 When we try to take his life, how can he be called a wicked if he bites us to save his life or to live his life? Don't we try to take the life of our souls? saanp ko sugandh bahut hi bhaati he
 He lives by clinging to the Champa plant or he lives on a sandalwood tree
 kevade ke van main bhi vah phirata rahata he
 She loves fragrance, so she loves Indian culture
 prayek maanav ko jivan main sadgunon kii sugandh aati he, suvicharon kii suvaas aati he, vah suvaas hamen priy honi chahie
 We know that a snake does not bite anyone without reason
 varshon parishram sanchit shakti yani jehar vah kisi ko yon hi katkar vyarth kho dena nahin chahta
 If we also do some tenacity in life, it will also give us power
 yah shakti kisi par gussa karne main, nirbalon ko hairaan karne main yaa ashakton ko dukh dene main vyarth na kar us shakti ko hamaara vikaas karne main, duusare asamarthon ko samarth banane main, nirbalon ko sabal banane main kharch karen, yahi apekshit he
 Some divine snakes have gem on their brain
 mani amuly hoti he
 We should also offer priceless things in life to the brain
 samaaj ke mukutamani jaise mahapurushon kaa sthaan hamaare mastishk par hona chahie
 We should lift their palanquin out of love and try to build our life according to their thoughts
 sarv vidyaon main manirup jo aadhyatm vidya he, uske liye hamaare jivan main anokhaa aakarshan hona chahie
 Do not be helpful in self-development, how can that knowledge be called knowledge? saanp bill main rahata he or adhikanshtah ekaant kaa seven karata he
 Therefore Mumukshu should avoid public gathering
 is bare main saanp kaa udhaaharan diya jaataa he
 By becoming the instrument in the ocean churning done by the Devas and demons, Vasuki Nag has opened the way for the wicked to become instruments in the Lord's work
 durjan maanav bhi yadi sachche maarg par aae to vah saanskrithik kaary main apana bahut bada yoga de saktaa he or durbalata satat khatkati rahane par aise maanav ko apane kiye hue satkarya ke liye zyada ghamand bhi nirmaan nahin hoga
 If Durjan too gets involved in the Bhagavad work, then the Lord also accepts him, this is supported by Shiva holding the snake in his neck and Vishnu by resting
 samgr sristi ke hit ke liye barasate barsaat ke kaaran nirvasit hua saanp jab hamaare ghar main atithi banakar aata he tab use aashray dekar kritagya buddhi se uskaa pujan karnaa hamaara karttavya ho jaataa he
 In this way, our sages have shown a lot of justification by keeping the festival of Nag Panchami in the month of Shravan itself
 puure shravan maah vishesh kar nagpanchami ko dharti khodna nishiddh he
 On this day, Kheer is fed and milk is fed to snakes
 kahin-kahin sawan maah kii krishna paksh kii panchami ko bhi naag panchami manaai jaati he
 On this day white lotus is kept in worship
 pracheen kaal main ek sethji ke saat putr the

 One day, the elder daughter-in-law asked all the daughters-in-law to go home to bring yellow soil to the house, and all the dug and dug started digging the soil
 tabhi vahaan ek sarp niklaa, jise badi bahu khurpy se maarane lagi
 Seeing this, the younger daughter-in-law stopped her and said- 'don't kill it? This poor innocent ' Hearing this, the elder daughter-in-law did not kill her, then the snake sat on one side
 tab choti bahu ne usase kaha-'ham abhi laut kar aati hai tum yahaan se janaa mat
 Having said this, she went home with all the soil and stuck in the work and forgot the promise made to the snake
 use duusare din vah baat yaad ai to sab ko saath lekar vahaan pahaunchi or sarp ko us sthaan par baitha dekhakar boli- sarp bhaiya namaskara! sarp ne kaha- 'tu bhaiya kah chuki he, isliye tuje chhod detaa hum, nahin to juthi baat kehane ke kaaran tuje abhi das letaa
 She said - Brother, i have made a mistake, ask for his forgiveness, then the snake said - OK, you are my sister from today and i am your brother
 tuje jo maangana ho, maang le
 She said - Brother! i have no one, it is good that you become my brother
 kuch din vyateet hone par vah sarp manushya kaa rup rakhkar uske ghar aayaa or bolaa ki 'meri bahin ko bhej do
 'everyone said that' he had no brother, so he said - i am his brother in a distant relationship, had gone out only in childhood
 uske vishwaas dilaane par ghar ke logon ne choti ko uske saath bhej diya
 On the way he told that 'I am the snake right there, so you do not be afraid and where there is difficulty in walking, take my question
 usne kahe anusaar hi kiya or is prakaar vah uske ghar pahunch gai
 She was surprised to see the riches there
 ek din sarp kii mata ne usase kaha- 'main ek kaam se baahar ja rahi hoon, tu apane bhai ko thanda doodh pilaa dena
 He did not mind this and gave him hot milk, in which his face burned without any reason
 yah dekhakar sarp kii mata bahut krodhit hui
 But upon the explanation of the snake, he became silent
 tab sarp ne kaha ki bahin ko ab uske ghar bhej dena chahie
 Then the serpent and his father gave him a lot of gold, silver, jewels, clothes and clothes etc
 to his house
 itnaa dher sara dhan dekhakar badi bahu ne irsha se kaha- bhai to bada dhanwaan he, tuje to usase or bhi dhan laana chahie
 When the snake heard this promise, he brought all the things with gold
 yah dekhakar badi bahu ne kaha- 'inhen jhaadne kii jhaadu bhi sone kii honi chahie'
 Then the snake also brought the broom with gold
 sarp ne choti bahu ko hira-maniyon kaa ek adbhut haar diya tha
 The queen of that country also heard her praise and she said to the king that the necklace of the younger daughter-in-law of Seth should come here
 ' raja ne mantri ko hukum diya ki usase vah haar lekar sheeghra upasthit ho mantri ne sethji se jaakar kaha ki 'maharaniji choti bahu kaa haar pahanengi, vah usase lekar mujhe de do'
 Sethji gave defeat to the younger daughter-in-law due to fear
 choti bahu ko yah baat bahut buree lagi, usne apane sarp bhai ko yaad kiya or aane par prarthana kii- bhaiya ! rani ne haar chin liya he, tum kuch aisa karo ki jab vah haar uske gale main rahe, tab tak ke liye sarp ban jaae or jab vah mujhe lautaa de tab hiron or maniyon kaa ho jaae
 The snake did exactly that
 jaise hi rani ne haar pahana, vaise hi vah sarp ban gaya
 Seeing this, the queen screamed and started crying
 yah dekh kar raja ne seth ke paas khabar bheji ki choti bahu ko turant bhejo
 Sethji was afraid that what would the king not know? He himself appeared with the younger daughter-in-law
 raja ne choti bahu se poocha- tune kya jaadu kiya he, main tuje dand duungaa
 Younger daughter-in-law said- Rajan! Forgiveness, this necklace is such that diamonds and beads are in my neck and a snake becomes in the other's neck
 yah sunakar raja ne vah sarp bana haar use dekar kaha- abhi pahinakar dikhaao
 As soon as the younger daughter-in-law wore her, so did the diamonds
 yah dekhakar raja ko uski baat kaa vishwaas ho gaya or usne prasann hokar use bahut si mudraaen bhi puraskaar main deen
 Younger she returned home with her necklace and these
 uske dhan ko dekhakar badi bahu ne irsha ke kaaran uske pati ko sikhaaya ki choti bahu ke paas kahin se dhan aayaa he
 Hearing this, her husband called his wife and said - Tell me exactly who gives you this money? Then she started remembering the snake
 tab usee samay sarp ne prakat hokar kaha- yadi meri dharm bahin ke aacharan par andeh prakat karegaa to main use kha loonga
 Hearing this, the younger daughter-in-law's husband was very happy and he gave great hospitality to the serpent god

 of the language is done
 bhashaa vigyaan ke adhyayeta 'bhashavigyaani' kehalaate hai
 Linguistics is different from grammar
 vyakaran main kisi bhashaa kaa kaaryaatmak adhyayan kiya jaataa he jabaki bhashavigyaani iske aage jaakar bhashaa kaa atyant vyapak adhyayan karata he
 Among the many subjects of study, linguistics is being given special importance nowadays
 bhashaa-sambandhi is adhyayan ko europe main aaj tak anek naamon or sangyaaon se abhihit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Firstly this study was added a word as an adjective next to the word Philology - then it was called as "comparative Philology"
 unnisvin shatabdi tak vyakaran tathaa bhashaa-vishyak adhyayan ko praayah ek hi samajha jaataa tha
 Hence, scholars also named it 'comparative Grammar'
 france main isko langistik naam diya gaya
 The name "linguistique" or "linguistics" has been prevalent in the whole of Europe in the nineteenth century due to the greater language related work in France
 iske atirikt 'science of language', ‘glautoleji’ aadi anya naam bhi is vishay ko prakat karne ke liye kaam main aaye
 Of all these names, "linguistics", "philology" are used only today
 bharatvarsh main in sabhi europea naamon ke atirikt hindi bhashaa main jo naam prayog main laae jate hai ve is prakaar hai- ‘‘bhashaa-shaastra’’, ‘‘bhashaa-tatva’’, ‘‘bhashaa-vigyaan’’, tathaa ‘‘tulanaatmak bhashaa-vigyaan’’ aadi
 Among all these names, the most common name is "linguistics"
 in naam main pracheen or naveen sabhi naamon kaa samaahaar-sa hua jaan padataa he
 Therefore, this name seems to be suitable for this scripture
 apane vartmaan swaroop main bhashaa vigyaan pashchimi vidwaanon ke mastishk kii dein kaha jaataa he
 The trend of language-related studies is found in Sanskrit literature since very ancient times
 ‘shiksha’ naamak vedang main bhashaa sambandhi sookshm charchaa uplabdh hoti he
 Detailed description of the pronunciation of the sounds - elements, location, effort etc
 is available in these texts
 ‘praatishakhya’ evam nirukt main shabdon kii vyutpatti, dhaatu, upsarg-pratyay aadi vishyon par vaigyanik vishleshan bhashaa kaa vaigyanik adhyayan kaha ja saktaa he
 Under Bhartrihari's book 'sentence Pad', subtle, deep and comprehensive thinking of the form of 'word' is available
 vahaan shabd ko ‘brahm’ ke rup main pariklpit kiya gaya he or uski ‘akshar’ sangya bataai gai he
 It is, by default, a language-related book
 sanskrit-sahitya main darshan evam sahityashastreey granthon main bhi hamen ‘shabd’ ’arth’, ‘ras’ ‘bhav’ ke sookshm vivechan ke antargat bhashaa vaigyanik charchaaon ke hi sanket praapt hote hai’ sanskrit-sahitya main yatra-tatra uplabdh hone vaali bhashaa-vichaar-vishyak saamagree hi nishchit rup se vartmaan bhashaa-vigyaan kii aadharshila kahi ja sakati he
 Linguistics as a modern subject is thought to have originated in Europe in 1786 AD by a scholar named Sir William Jones
 sanskrit bhashaa ke adhyayan ke prasang main sar wiliam jones ne hi sarvapratham sanskrit, greek or latin bhashaa kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan karte hue is sambhaavna ko vyakt kiya tha ki sambhawatah in teenon bhashaaon ke mul main koi ek bhashaa rup hi aadhaar bana hua he
 Therefore, there exists a subtle formula between these three languages
 bhashaaon kaa is prakaar kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan hi aadhunaki bhashaa-vigyaan ke kshetra kaa pehla kadam bana
 Two terms have been used in the name "linguistics"
 ‘‘bhashaa’’ tathaa ‘‘vigyaan’’
 Before understanding linguistics, it seems necessary to be familiar with both these words
 ‘bhashaa’ shabd sanskrit kii ‘‘bhash’’ dhaatu se nishpann hua he
 Which means - express speech
 ‘vigyaan’ shabd main ‘vi’ upsarg tathaa ‘gya’ dhaatu se ‘lut’ pratyay lagane par banataa he
 In general, 'bhasha' means 'spoken language or dialect' and 'vigyan' means 'special knowledge', but only after understanding the clear and comprehensive meaning of these two terms used in the word 'linguistics'
 We will be able to know the essence of this name
 atah ham yahan in donon padon ke vistrut arth ko spasht karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 Language: Human being is a social animal
 samaaj main apane bhaavon or vichaaron ko ek duusare tak pahunchane kii aavashyaktaa chirkaal se anubhav kii jaati rahi he
 Thus the existence of language proves to be very ancient in human society
 maanav ke sampoorn gyaan-vigyaan kaa prakaashan karne ke liye, sabhyataa or samskruti ke itihaas ko jaanane ke liye bhashaa ek mahatvapurn saadhan kaa kaary karti he
 We have come to know all the ordinary and extraordinary experiences from our ancestors through language
 hamaare sabhi sadgranthon or shastron se milane vaala gyaan bhashaa par hi nirbhar he
 Mahakavi Dandi has written in his great book 'kavyadarsha' informing the importance of language: - arthath yah sampoorn bhuwan andhkarpurn ho jaataa, yadi sansar main shabd-swaroop jyoti arthath bhashaa kaa prakaash na hota
 It is clear that this statement has been said to target human language
 pashu-pakshi bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye jin dhvaniyon kaa aashray lete hai ve unke bhaavon kaa vahan karne ke kaaran unke liye bhashaa ho sakati hai kintu maanav ke liye aspasht hone ke kaaran vidwaanon ne use ‘avyakt vaak’ kaha he, jo bhashaa-vigyaan kii drushti se koi mahatva nahin rakhti
 Because in 'avyakta speech' both the words and meanings remain unclear
 manushya bhi kabhi-kabhi apane bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye ang-bhangima, bhru-sanchaalan, haath-paanv-mukhaakriti aadi ke sanketon kaa prayog karte hai parantu vah bhashaa ke rup main hote hue bhi ‘vyakt vaak’ nahin he
 The greatest feature of human language is that it is 'articulated speech', that is, having clarity of words and meanings
 mahabhashya ke rachayita patanjali ke anusaar ‘vyakt vaak’ kaa arth bhashaa ke varnanaatmak hone se hi he
 It is true that sometimes even with the help of signs and disguises, our sentiments and thoughts are transmitted very easily
 is prakaar ve cheshtaayen bhashaa ke pratik ban jaati hai kintu maanav bhaavon ko prakat karne kaa sabase upyukt saadhan vah varnanaatmak bhashaa he jise ‘vyakt vaak’ kii sangya pradaan kii gai he
 In this, certain accented or perceived sounds are taken to reveal different meanings
 atah bhashaa ham un shabdon ke samooh ko kehete hai jo vibhinn arthon ke sanketon se sampann hote hai
 By whom we can easily reveal our feelings to others
 is prakaar bhashaa kii paribhaasha karte hue ham use maanav-samaaj main vichaaron or bhaavon kaa aadan-pradaan karne ke liye apanaaya jane vaala ek madhyam kah sakate hai jo maanav ke uccharan avyavon se prayatnpurvak nicksruth kii gai dhvaniyon kaa sarthak aadhaar liye rahata he
 Those phonemes take the form of words when they are attached to a meaning
 sampoorn dhwani-vyapaar arthath shabd-samooh apane arth ke saath ek ‘yadrichhik’ sambandh par aadhaarit hota he
 'random' means completely fictitious
 sankshep main vibhinn arthon main vyakt kiye gaye mukh se uccharit us shabd samooh ko ham bhashaa kehete hai jiske dwaara ham apane bhav or vichaar dusron tak pahunchaate hai
 We have many benefits from the study of linguistics, such as- 1
 apni chir-parichit bhashaa ke vishay main jigyaasa kii tripti yaa shankaaon kaa nirmulan
 2
 Introduction to historical and prehistoric culture
 3
 kisi jati yaa sampoorn maanavtaa ke maansik vikaas kaa parichay
 4
 Solution of many problems related to the meaning, pronunciation and use of ancient literature
 5
 vishwa ke liye ek bhashaa kaa vikaas
 6
 Assistance in learning foreign languages
 7
 anuwaad karne vaali tathaa swayan tip karne vaali evam isi prakaar kii mashiinon ke vikaas or nirmaan main sahaayta
 8
 Assistance in change in terms of simplicity, correctness etc
 in language, script etc
 in sabhi laabhon kii drushti se aaj ke yug main bhashaa-vigyaan ko ek atyant upyogi vishay mana ja rahaa he or uske adhyayan ke kshetra main nity naveen vikaas ho rahaa he
 Language is a natural object that is found as a divine gift to humans
 bhashaa kaa nirmaan manushya ke mukh se swaabhaavik rup main nicksruth dhvaniyon ke dwaara hota he
 The common knowledge of the language becomes available to all who speak and hear it
 yahi bhashaa kaa saamaanya gyaan kehalaata he
 Next, when did language become, how did it become? What was its initial and ancient form? When and what changes did it happen and what are the reasons for those changes? Or how did the language develop overall? What are the reasons for that development? Which language has so much similarity or dissimilarity with which other language? All this will be called special knowledge of language or 'linguistics'
 isi bhashaa-vigyaan ke vishesh rup arthath bhashaa vigyaan ko aaj adhyayan kaa ek mahatvapurn vishay maan liya gaya he
 When the subjects of linguistics were included under the syllabus of large classes, a natural question first arose whether linguistics should be counted under art or in science
 arthath bhashaa-vigyaan kala he athwa vigyaan he
 It was decided to take the process and conclusions of the study that in reality it should be considered as pure science like physics, and chemistry etc
 or to be accepted as art like painting, music, sculpture, poetry etc
 kala kaa sambandh maanav-jati vastuon yaa vishyon se hota he
 This is why art is individual or completely individual
 vyakti saapeksh hone ke saath-saath kisi desh vishesh or kaal-vishesh kaa bhi kala par prabhaav rahata he
 This means that the values that remain for art in a period, new changes are present in the future and they should be accepted in other countries also, it is not necessary
 ek vyakti ko kisi vastu main ucch kalatmak abhivyakti lag rahi he
 But to others she does not look like this
 atah kala kii dharna prayek vyakti kii bhinn-bhinn hua karti he
 Art is related to the emotional instinct of the human heart
 usamen vyakti kii soundaryanubhuti kaa put mila rahata he
 The purpose of art is also to provide beauty, or to provide joy, not to do an elemental analysis of something
 kala ke swaroop kii in sabhi visheshtaon kii kasuti par parakhane se gyaat hota he ki bhashaa-vigyaan kala nahin he
 Because it is not related to the plausibility of the heart but to the philosophical view of the intellect
 bhashaa-vigyaan kaa uddeshy soundaryanubhuti karana yaa manoranjan karana bhi nahin he
 That makes our intellectual thinking sharp
 bhashaa ke astitv kaa tattvik moolyankan karata he
 His approach is rational
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke nishkarsh kisi vyakti, raashtra yaa kaal ke aadhaar par parivartit nahin hote hai tathaa bhashaa-vigyaan ke adhyayan kaa mul aadhaar jo bhashaa he vah maanavkrut padaarth nahin he
 Therefore, we cannot count linguistics in the field of art
 bhashaa-vigyaan kii upyogita isamen he ki vah bhashaa sikhaane kii kala kaa gyaan karaata he
 For this reason, Sweet has called grammar a language as both an art and a science
 bhashaa kaa shuddh uccharan, prabhaavshaalee prayog kala kii koti main rakhe ja sakate hai
 Linguistics cannot be kept within the limits of art, when it is decided that the question arises as to whether linguistics, physics, chemistry etc
 are subjects like science? anek vidwaanon kii dharna main bhashaa-vigyaan vishuddh vigyaan nahin he
 According to his belief, all the experiments of linguistics have not yet been achieved to perfection and hence its conclusions cannot be called final conclusions
 iske saath hi bhashaa-vigyaan ke sabhi nishkarsh vigyaan kii bhanti saarvbhaumik or saarvkalik bhi nahin he
 Just as mathematics has 2 + 2 = 4 everlasting, inferential conclusions that are universally accepted, linguistics does not have an unquestionable conclusion of this kind
 vigyaan main tathyon kaa sankalan or vishleshan hota he or dhwani ke niyam adhikanshtah vikalparahit hi hai, atah kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar bhashaa-vigyaan ko manviki evam vigyaan ke madhya main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 After considering it, we see that in today's fast progress of science, every particular knowledge is becoming old and unscientific in front of its upcoming knowledge
 nity naveen avishkaron ke aaj ke yug main vaigyanik drushti nity sookshm se sookshmatar or naveen se navyatar hoti chali ja rahi he
 In view of today's developed field of knowledge, many scientific beliefs have become outdated and faded
 newton kaa prakaash siddhanth bhi ab sandeh kii drushti se dekha jane laga he
 This proves that in the light of new knowledge, ancient knowledge is also excluded from the field of science
 atah vishuddh gyaan kii drushti se vichaar karne par bhashaa-vigyaan ko ham vigyaan ke hi seemaa-kshetra main pate hai
 Linguistics is definitely a science under which we gain special knowledge of language
 yah sahi he ki abhi tak bhashaa-vigyaan kaa vaigyanik str par purnatah vikaas nahin ho paaya he
 This is the reason why Grasmann and Werner had to improve by following the famous Grimm-rule
 ukt sudhaaron se purv grim kaa dhwani niyam nischit niyam hi mana jaataa tha or sudhaaron ke baad bhi vah nischit niyam hi mana jaataa he
 Thus, there is no opposition to science due to the refutation of old principles in the light of new knowledge
 vastav main yahi shuddh vigyaan he
 After 1930, where descriptive linguistics gained importance again, there has been rapid development since then
 jab se dhwani ke kshetra main yantron kii sahaayta se naye-naye pareekshan prarambh hue hai tathaa praapt nishkarsh puri tarah niyamit hone lage hai, tab se hi bhashaa-vigyaan dhire-dhire pragati karata hua vigyaan kii shrenee main mana jane laga he
 One of the great features of science is its experimentalism
 america vidvan balum feeld ke baad america bhashaa vigyaniyon ne dhwani-vigyaan evam rup-vigyaan aadi ke saath bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek naveen paddati ke rup main praayogic bhashaa-vigyaan kaa badi tivrata ke saath vikaas kiya he
 Under this method, linguistics is becoming the subject of laboratories and many instruments have been invented for it
 yah dekh kar nishchit rup main is vishay ko vigyaan hi kaha jayega, isamen tanik bhi andeh nahin he
 Nowadays, where the tradition of using the word science has been done for the classical subjects like sociology, psychology etc
, then linguistics based on pure cause-work tradition cannot be called as inappropriate from any point of view
 dow shyamsundar das ne apane granth bhashaa rahasy main likhaa he- In the words of Mangal Dev Shastri dow bholanath tiwari ke ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ granth main yah paribhaasha is prakaar di gai he- By considering all the definitions given above, it is known that there is no difference between them
 dow shyamsundar das kii paribhaasha main jahaan keval bhashavigyaan par hi drushti kendrit rahi he vahin mangaldev shastri evam bholanath tiwari ne apni paribhaashaon main bhashaa vigyaan ke adhyayan ke prakaaron ko bhi samahit kar liya he
 Definitions are good that are concise and clear
 is prakaar ham bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek naveen paribhaasha is prakaar de sakate hai- “jis adhyayan ke dwaara maanviya bhashaaon kaa sookshm or vishleshnatmak adhyayan kiya jaae, use bhashaa-vigyaan kaha jaataa he
 " duusare shabdon main bhashaa-vigyaan vah he jisamen maanviya bhashaaon kaa sookshm or vyapak vaigyanik adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Except the current form of language, the rest of the study material is available only from literature to linguistics
 yadi aaj hamaare saamne sanskrit, greek or avesta sahitya na hota to bhashaa-vigyaan kabhi yah jaanane main safal na hota ki ye teenon bhashaayen kisi ek mul bhashaa se nikali hai
 Similarly, if Hindi literature from the early to modern period was not in front of us, how could linguistics study the historical development of Hindi language? bhashaa-vigyaan kisi prakaar se bhi bhashaa kaa adhyayan kare use pag-pag par sahitya kii sahaayta leni padati he
 Hearing this from the mouth of the naughty boys of Bundelkhand- vyakaran kahata he ki yah kya bhalaa he, pracheen sahitya kaa adhyayan hi use batalaayegaa ki shakatayan ke pratham sutara ‘uun namah siddham’ kaa hi yah bigadaa hua rup he
 Literature also succeeds in finding solutions to many of its problems with the help of linguistics
 dow vasudev sharan agarwal ne bhashaa-vigyaan ke siddhanton ke aadhaar par jysikrut ‘padmavat’ ke bahut se shabdon ko unke mul roopon se jod kar unke arthon ko spasht kiya he
 It has also taken substantial help in determining the pure text
 atah sahitya or bhashaa-vigyaan donon ek duusare ke sahaayak hai
 Language is a reflection of our thoughts and thoughts, so with the help of language many problems can be solved
 vishesh rup se arthvigyaan to manovigyaan par puri tarah se aadhaarit he
 Psychology also provides adequate help in the study of syntax
 kabhi-kabhi dhwani-parivartan kaa kaaran jaanane ke liye bhi manovigyaan hamaari sahaayta karata he
 Child psychology and psychology of underdeveloped people also helps us in knowing the origin and initial form of language
 manovigyaan ko bhi apni chikitsa-paddati main rogi kii ulajlul baton kaa arth jaanane ke liye bhashaa-vigyaan se sahaayta leni padati he
 Therefore, with the help of linguistics, a psychologist can be successful in detecting the patient's ailments
 bhashaa-vigyaan or manovigyaan ke ghanishtha sambandhon ke kaaran hi aajkal bhashaa manovigyaan yaa psycolinginvasticks naamak ek nayi adhyayan-paddati kaa vikaas ho rahaa he
 Language is called the sound emanating from the mouth, so in linguistics, how does the air move from within, what changes do it cause due to larynx, larynx, nasal cavity, crow, palate, teeth, tongue, lip, throat, hoarseness and nose and One has to study how sound is received by the ear
 isamen sharir-vigyaan hi uski sahaayta karata he
 Eclipse of written language is done by eye and study of this process is also done under linguistics
 iske liye bhi use sharir vigyaan kaa rini hona padataa he
 Linguistics and geography also have a deep connection
 kuch logon ke anusaar kisi sthaan kii bhugolic paristhitiyon kaa uski bhashaa par gaharaa prabhaav padataa he
 In the language spoken in a place, there are definitely words for trees, plants, birds, animals and food etc
 But if any of them ends, then its name also gets attached to the language there
 ‘somalata’ shabd kaa prayog aaj hamaari bhashaa main nahin hota
 The reason for this omission is probably geographical
 kisi sthaan main ek bhashaa kaa dur tak prasar na hona, bhashaa main kam vikaas hona tathaa kisi sthaan main bahut si boliyon kaa hona bhi bhugolic paristhitiyon kaa hi parinaam hota he
 The castes living on inaccessible mountains are unable to spread their dialect due to low mutual contact
 nadiyon ke aar-paar rahane vaale logon kii boli-bhashaa saamaanya bhashaa se hat kar bhinn hoti he
 In doing linguistic studies of the names of countries, cities, rivers and provinces etc
, geography provides great recreational material
 arth-vichaar ke kshetra main bhi bhugol bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta karata he
 Geography also helps in considering the problems of 'camel', how camel came out of buffalo and why 'sandhava' means horse and salt
 bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek shakha bhashaa-bhugol kii adhyayan-paddati to thik bhugol kii hi bhanti hoti he
 Similarly, linguistics is also helpful in studying the geography of prehistoric times of a place
 itihaas kaa bhi bhashaa-vigyaan se ghanishtha sambandh he
 With regard to three forms of history, political history, religious history, social history - its relation with linguistics is being shown here
 bhashavigyaan ke adhyayan main tarkshastra, bhautikashastra evam maanav-shaastra jaise anya gyaan ke kshetra bhi badi sahaayta pahunchaate hai
 Many kinds of superstitions in humans take place which affect their language
 bhartiya saamaj main striyaan apane pati kaa naam ghuma-firaakar leti he, sidhaa-spasht nahin
 At night giant insects are not named
 ve apane ladke kaa naam maange, chhedi, bechu, ghurhu, katvaaru alichaar yaa lenda, aadi rakhte hai
 Apart from superstitions, many other socio-psychology related clauses have to resort to the branches of anthropology
 is prakaar gyaan ke anek kshetra- samskruti-adhyayan, shikshashastra, sankhyikee, paath-vigyaan - aadi bhashaa vigyaan se gaharaa sambandh rakhte hai
 The field of human language is the field of linguistics
 sansarbhar ke sabhy-asabhy manushyon kii bhashaaon or boliyon kaa adhyayan bhashaa-vigyaan ke antargat kiya jaataa he
 In this way, linguistics does not only study civilized-literary languages, but also the study of those languages which are lost in the pride of the past, which are not in vogue, barbaric-unfriendly dialects
 vishay-vibhaajan kii drushti se bhashavigyaan ko bhashaa-sanrachana evam 'arth kaa adhyayan' main baanta jaataa he
 In it, apart from analyzing and describing the language from a scientific point of view, comparative studies between different languages are also done
 bhashavigyaan ke do paksh hai- tattvik or vyavhaarik
 In addition, linguistics has a deep connection with other branches of knowledge science
 isse samajabhashavigyaan, manobhashavigyaan, gananamulak bhashavigyaan, aadi isaki vibhinn shakhaon kaa vikaas hua he
 The following are the minor areas of linguistics: vaakya-vigyaan : bhashaa main sara vichaar-vinimay vaakyon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 The department of linguistics in which it is considered is called syntax or syntax
 iske teen rup hai- Syntax is related to the psychology of the speaking society
 isliye bhashaa-vigyaan kii yah shakha bahut kathin he
 Morphology: The construction of a sentence is based on terms or forms
 atah vaakya ke baad pad yaa rup kaa vichaar mahatvapurn ho jaataa he
 Under meteorology, all the instruments have to be considered from the metal, prefix, suffix etc
 shabd-vigyaan : rup yaa pad kaa aadhaar shabd he
 The words composition or history can be considered from these two points of view
 kisi vyakti yaa bhashaa kaa vichaar bhi iske antargat kiya jaataa he
 Thesaurus and etymology come under the limits of the field of word science itself
 bhashaa ke shabd samooh ke aadhaar par bolne vaale kaa saanskrithik itihaas janaa ja saktaa he
 Phonology: The basis of the word is sound
 dhwani-vigyaan ke antargat dhvaniyon kaa anek prakaar se adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Under it, phonology is a separate subdivision in which the sound-producing organs — buccal-vocal, nasal-vocal, vocal apparatus, sound-instrument, as well as the process of hearing are also studied
 is adhyayan ke do rup hai-aitihaasik or doosraa tulanaatmak
 The Grimm rule is related to this
 arth-vigyaan : vaakya kaa bahari ang dhwani par samaapt ho jaataa he yah bhashaa kaa bahari kalevar he iske aage uski aatma kaa kshetra prarambh hota he jise ham arth kehete hai
 a word without meaning is meaningless like a selfless body
 atah arth bhashaa kaa ek mahatvapurn ang hota he
 In semantics, the development of the meanings of words and its reasons are considered
 kisi bhi adhyayan ko ham vaigyanik tab kehete hai jab usamen ek nishchit prakriya ko apana kar chalate hai
 Linguistics is also tied to certain processes for the purposeful rational analysis of a language
 inhen prakriyaaon ke aadhaar par abhi tak bhashaa-vigyaan ke paanch prakaar ke adhyayan hamen praapt hote hai- Language is usually studied with the following terms: varnatmak paddati dwaara ek hi kaal kii kisi ek bhashaa ke swaroop kaa vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 For this, the principles highlighted in it, on the basis of which the creative features of language-specific can be explained
 dhyatavya he ki is paddati main ek saath vibhinn kaalon ko bhashaa kaa samavesh nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki har kaal kii bhashaa ke vishleshan ke liye pruthak-pruthak siddhanton kaa prayojan padegaa
 Panini is the largest linguist not only in India, but also in the world, who has done a detailed and comprehensive study of the language in descriptive form
