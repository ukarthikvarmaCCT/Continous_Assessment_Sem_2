 The origin of Adi Guru Sri Gurugranth Sahib is the Amritamayi voice pronounced by Japji Jagatguru Shri Gurunanakdevji for public welfare
 'japuji' ek vishuddh ek sutaramayi darshanik vaani he usamen mahatvapurn darshanik satyon ko sundar arthpurna or sankshipt bhashaa main kaavyatmak dhang se abhivyakt kiya he
 Supernatural knowledge of Brahm Gyan is light in it
 iskaa divya darshan maanav jivan kaa chintan he
 In this speech, the true, eternal values of religion are presented in a seductive manner
 atah mahaan guru kii is mahaan kriti kii vyakhya karnaa to dur ise samajhnaa bhi aasaan nahin he
 But for those who know the languages used in it, thinking, contemplating it is sublime and evocative
 yah ek pehali dharmik or rahasywaadee rachana he or aadhyatmik evam saahitiyik kshetra main iskaa atyadhik mahatv mahaan he
 The birth accounts of Guru Nanak mention that when Guruji lived in Sultanpur, he used to go daily to bathe in the nearby Vai river
 jab ve 27 varsh ke the, tab ek din praatavkaal ve nadi main snaan karne ke liye gaye or teen din tak nadi main samadhisth rahe
 It is said in the account that at this time Guruji was interviewed by God
 un par ishwar kii krupa hui thi or devi anukampaa ke pratik rup main ishwar ne guruji ko ek amrit kaa pyaalaa pradaan kiya tha
 There is a witness in the accounts that with the inspiration of this supernatural experience, Guruji pronounced the Mantmantra, from which the Japuji Sahib begins
 japuji kaa praarambhik shabd ek omkari beej mantra he jaise upanishdon or gita main om shabd beej mantra he
 The basic mantra is, in which the attributes of the Lord are mentioned
 samast japuji ko mote taur par chaar bhaagon main vibhakt kiya gaya he- In the first seven, the problem of soul-searching spirituality is explained
 aglaa bhaag pathakon ko uttarottar saadhan path kii ore agrasar karata jaataa he, jab tak ki jeevatma ko mahaan satya kaa saakshaatkaar nahin ho jaataa
 The third part describes the mental trends and vision of a person who has tasted the taste of spirituality
 antim bhaag main samast sadhana kaa saar prastut kiya gaya he, jo swayan main atyadhik moolyawaan he, kyonki is bhaag main satya or shaashvat satya, sadhana path kii ore, unmukh manansheel aatma kaa aadhyatmik vikaas ke charnon kaa pratyaksh varnan kiya gaya he
 Japuji is a unique literary work along with the spiritual voice of Shri Guru Nanak
 isaki prashnottaree style pathak ke bhaavon par amit chhap chhoti he
 In this, Guruji himself has addressed them in a meticulous manner by mentioning questions or apprehensions of the curious mind
 isamen andeh nahin ki japuji ek darshanik or vichaar pradhan kriti he or isaki rachana guruji kii anya vaani kii bhanti raagon ke anusaar nahin kii gai he
 But still many verses have been used in it
 isamen mukhya chand, doha, chaupai tathaa naatak aadi hai
 There is a shloka at the beginning and end of japuji
 japuji ke pehle charan kii pehali teen panktiyon kaa tukant ek he or usamen aage teen panktiyon kaa alag
 'an Onkar 


' is Prasadi Praise

 Like the rhyme, the rhyme of the rows is found from the middle
 jaise Similarly, it can be said that Gurunanak started expressing ideas in the form of a pouche
 kuch shabdon main baar-baar dohraane se bhi sangeetmayi lay utpann ho gai he
 For example, in the third phase, repeated words of 'gave Ko' have been used very briefly in the sutra style
 is sankshiptata tathaa sanyam ke liye roopak kaa prayog aksar hota he
 The metaphor has been used mostly in Japuji
 jaise- The metaphor of the goldsmith shop in the last phase of Japuji reveals the means of man's virtuous life and self-progress
 isi tarah sharir ko 'kapakahana jisamen sharir kaa naash tathaa phir navaroop dhaaran karne kii prakriya jaan pati he
 'aap bje aaphe khahu' explains the action principle of farming life
 'mati vichi ratna jawahar maanik' main manushya ke gun aadi ko ratna, jawahar tathaa moti kaha he
 By saying 'asankh Sura Muh Bharva Saar', he has given the vision of the compulsion of the spiritual warrior who keeps facing his attacks in the field of religion
 'santokh thapi rakhiya jini suti' kahkar sansar ke niyambaddh hone kaa bhed samajha diya he
 Just as all the beads are threaded in the sutra, similarly the whole world is threaded in a thread like santokh rule
 beesvin paumen buddhi kii shuddhta ke liye bahut alankrita vaani main man ko sristi ke darshan ko samajhaayaa gaya he
 Guru Nanak was a folk teacher
 isiilie unhone ishwariya sandesh ko jan-jan tak pahunchaane ke liye japuji main lokbhasha kaa hi sarvaadhik upyog kiya
 The language of 'japuji' can be called the saint language of that time, which has a mixture of Braj language
 japuji ke rachanakaal main sanskrit ke shabdon ko punjabi yaa tadbhav rup main likhaa jaataa tha
 Some words in Japuji are also in the corresponding form of arabic-persian
 jaise-pir, paro, darbar, kudarat, hukmadi
 Most forms have been taken, such as wages, nandri, kagad etc

 According to Manusmriti, all persons are Shudras by birth, they are called Dwij only through rituals
 In Skanda Purana, Lord Brahma has said spiritually - Janmana jayate shudra: Sanskarat Dwijochyate
 in pariwaron main nari ko bhi vishesh sammaan diya jaataa he
 Women also have the right to acquire knowledge
 nari hi parivaar kaa nirmaan karti he
 Gives children rites
 isliye nari ko padhaa-likhaa hona chahie
 Where a woman is worshiped, the deities reside there and where there is insult, there is famine and famine

 Introduction of manu manu jo ek dharamshastrakaar the, dharmagranthon ke baad dharmacharan kii shiksha dene ke liye adipurush swayambhuv manu ne smriti kii rachana kii jo manusmriti ke naam se vikhyath he
 He was among the psyche sons of Brahma who were married to Shatrupa, born from the right part of Brahma
 uttanpad jiske ghar main dhruv paidaa hua tha, inhen kaa putr tha
 Priyavrata, the eldest son of Manu Swayambhuva, is considered the first Kshatriya of the earth
 inke dwaara pranit 'swyambhuv shaastra' ke anusaar pita kii sampatti main putr or putree kaa samaan adhikaar he
 He is considered to be the teacher of theology and Prachatas Manu of economics
 manusmriti ne sanathan dharm ko aachaar samhita se joda tha
 Ayoniz Kanya Shatrupa was born from the religion of Prajapati named Aapav
 aapav ne praja kii rachana karne ke uparaant shatarupa ko apni patni bana liya
 His son's name was Veer
 vir ne prajapati kardam kii kanya kamya se vivaah kiya tathaa do putron ko janm diya- priyavrat tathaa uttanpad
 Dhruva, Ven, etc
 occurred in Manu's extended child
 wain se manugan bahut rusht the kyonki vah anaachari tha
 The sages churned his right hand, which led to the birth of King Prithu
 ve rajasuya yajna karne vaale raajaaon main sarvapratham tha
 With the desire to provide livelihood to the people, he could start exploiting the grain and milk from the earth
 saath-saath rakshas, pitar, devtaa, apsara, naag ityadi sab is karm main lag gayi
 Later, he had two sons, Intradhan and Patin
 antardhan se shikhandini ne havirdhan ko janm diya
 Havidhana gave birth to six sons - Agni Vahris, Venus, Gaya, Krishna, Braj and Ajin, from Agni's daughter Ghishna
 pracheenvarhis ne ghor tap karke samudr-kanya savarna se vivaah kiya
 He had ten sons who followed the same religion
 ve prachetha naam se vikhyath hue
 Brahma was anxious
 'sambhavat: dev hi nahin chahta ki sristi kaa vistaar ho, anyathaa itane praytn ke uparaant bhi main sristi kaa vistaar nahin kar paa rahaa hum
 His body is called 'A' as soon as he thinks so
 at: donon bhaag kaay kahalaaye
 One of them was Manu, the other was Shatrupa
 swyambhuv manu ne shatarupa se paanch santan praapt kin: do putr- priyavrat, uttanpad tathaa teen kanyaayein- aakuti, devhooti tathaa prasuti
 Manu asked Brahma that which place do they think is right for the residence of the subjects? Brahma started contemplation, so Vishnu did the work of bringing the earth submerged in water over water
 manu kaa ullekh rugveda kaal se hi maanav sristi ke aadi pravartak or samast maanav jati ke aadi-pita ke rup main kiya jaataa rahaa he
 They are also called 'adipurush'
 aarambh main manu or yama kaa astitv abhinn tha
 Later Manu was considered to be the protagonist of living humans and Yama in another world, the dead man
 shatapath brahman ke anusaar ek machhlee ne manu se pralay kii baat kahi thi or baad main inhen se sristi chali
 Elsewhere, they are said to be the sons of Virat from whom the Prajapatis originated
 matsay puraana manu ko 'manusmriti' kaa rachayita or ek shaastra pravartak maanata he
 According to the Puranas, Manu is fourteen
 vaidic samhitaon main manu ko aitihaasik vyakti mana gaya he
 He was the first human who is the father of mankind and the pioneer of mankind in all fields
 vaidic kaaleen jalplavan kii katha ke nayak manu hi he
 Vivasvan or Vaivasvata to Manu, the son of Vivasvanta; Descendants of Savarni and Samvarni Samvar)
 pratham naam puranic he, jabaki duusare naam aitihaasik hai
 Savarni is called the king of Ludvig Turvusu, but this belief is doubtful
 puraanon main manu ko maanav jati kaa guru tathaa prayek manvantar main sthit kaha gaya he
 He knows the duties of caste
 bhagavadgita bhi manuon kaa ullekh karti he
 It appears from several mentions called Manu that it is a title rather than a name
 manu shabd kaa mul man dhaatu se bhi yahi prathit hota he
 Medhatithi, who is a commentator of Manusmriti, calls Manu the title of the person, whose name is Prajapati
 ve dharm ke prakrut rup ke gyaata the evam maanav jati ko uski shiksha dete the
 Thus it is known that Manu is a title
 manu rachit 'maanav dharamshastra' bhartiya dharamshastra main aadim va mukhya granth mana jaataa he
 The ancient texts where the incarnations of human theology have come are in the form and do not meet the verses of the prevailing Manusmriti
 vah sutaragranth 'maanav dharamshastra' abhi tak dekhne main nahin aayaa
 The present Manusmriti can be considered to be a karika written on the basis of the same basic formulas
 vartmaan sabhi smritiyon main yah pradhan samajhi jaati he
 Aamne opposite is a Hindi language film made in 1967
 prakruti main sabhi rasinic padaarth saadhaarant: thos, drav or gas tathaa plasma - in chaar avasthaaon main paae jate hai
 Fluids and gases can flow, but solids do not flow
 lacheele thos padaarthon main aaytan athwa aakaar ko vikrut karne se pratibal utpann hota he
 Deformation and stress are mutually proportional to minor deformations
 is gun ke kaaran lacheele thos ek nishchit maan tak ke bahari balon ko sanbhaalane kii kshamta rakhte hai
 Fluids and gases are called liquids due to their properties of flow
 ye padaarth kartan balon ko sanbhaalane main aksham hote hai or gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav ke kaaran pravaahit hokar jis baratan main rakhe rahete hai, usee kaa aakaar dhaaran kar lete hai
 The mechanical distinction between solid and liquid is not very clear
 bahut se padaarth, visheshat: ucch koti ke bahulak ke yantric gun, shyaan taral or lacheele thos ke gunon ke madhyavarti hote hai
 a critical temperature is found for each substance, which, when exceeded, can only remain in the liquid state
 kranthik taap par padaarth kii drav or gas avasthaa main vishesh antar nahin rah jaataa
 At every temperature below this, some of its vapor is present along with the fluid and this vapor also has a certain pressure
 is dabaav ko vaashp dabaav kehete hai
 The maximum value of vapor pressure at each temperature is fixed
 is adhiktam dabaav ko samprukt-vaashp-dabaav ke baraabar athwa usase adhik ho, to drav sthaayee rahata he
 If the upper pressure is less than the combined vapor pressure of the fluid, then the fluid is temporary
 samprukt-vaashp-dabaav taap ke badhane se badhata he
 At the temperature at which the fluid-pressure-vapor pressure becomes equal to the pressure of the external environment, the fluid evaporates very rapidly
 is taap ko drav kaa kvathanank kehete hai
 If the external pressure is absolutely constant then the fluid below the boiling point is permanent
 kvathanank par pahunchne par yah khaulane lagata he
 In this case, it starts exploiting the heat and converts it from a liquid state to a gas state
 kvathanank par drav ke ikai dravyaman ko drav se purnat: gas main parivartit karne ke liye jitne calories ooshmaa kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, use drav ke vashpibhawan kii gupt ooshmaa kehete hai
 Its value varies for different liquids
 ek niyat dabaav par thos or drav donon rup saath saath ek nishchit taap par paae ja sakate hai
 This heat is called the liquid's icepoint or solid's liquid point
 dravnank par padaarth ke ikai dravyaman ko thos se purnat: drav main parivartit karne main jitani ooshmaa kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, use thos ke galan kii gupt ooshmaa kehete hai
 No fixed melting point is found for amorphous substances
 ve garam karne par dhire dhire mulaayam hote jate hai or phir drav avasthaa main aa jate hai
 Other substances such as glass and glass behave similarly
 ek niyat taap or niyat dabaav par prayek dravya kii teenon avasthaaen ek saath vidyaman rah sakati hai
 In the diagram drawn between pressure and heat, these fixed heat and pressure are represented by a point
 is bindu ko drav kaa trik bindu kehete hai
 The fluid remains unstable at lower pressures than the tricolor
 yadi kisi thos ko trik vindu kii apeksha nimna dabaav par rakhkar garam kiya jaae to vah bina drav bane hi vaashp main parivartit ho jaataa he, arthath urdhvpaatit ho jaataa he
 In the free surface of the fluid, which is in contact with the vapor or normal air of that fluid, a special property is found, due to which this surface behaves like a thinner membrane
 is gun ko prishth tanaav kehete hai
 The surface area of the fluid is as low as possible due to surface tension
 kisi die aaytan ke liye sabase kam kshetrafal ek gole kaa hota he
 Therefore, in such situations when external forces can be considered negligible, the drops of liquid are round
 jab koi drav kisi thos, yaa anya kisi amishray drav, ke sampark main aata he to bhi sampark tal par tanaav utpann hota he
 Normally any substance can be obtained in only one type of liquid form, but there are some exceptions, such as two types of helium fluid can be obtained by liquefying helium gas
 usee prakaar para-azoxi-enisol prakaashat: vishamdaishik drav ke rup main, crystalia avasthaa main tathaa saamaanya drav ke rup main bhi praapt ho saktaa he
 The molecules of each material are attracted to each other
 is aakarshan ko antaranuk aakarshan kehete hai
 Due to this, the molecules of a material are collected
 dravya ke anuon par ek vikarshan bal bhi lagata rahata he
 This force prevents the molecules from coming too close to each other
 thos ke anuon ke bich ye bal prabal hote hai
 Their values are small in liquids and almost negligible in gases
 crystalia thos kii lakshanik visheshta yah hoti he ki usamen nikat paraas or dur paraas main bhi anuon kii ek suniyojit vyavastha bani hoti he
 Some molecules combine into small groups
 in guton kii aantarik rachana ek si hoti he
 These are called unicellular cells
 yahi nikat paraas kii vyavastha kehalaati he
 The system of far-range means that the unicellular cells of a crystalline solid are also arranged in a particular way, that is, the arrangement of the unicellular is not arbitrary but recurrent
 drav or thos main mukhya bhed yahi he ki drav main doorparaas vyavastha bilkul nahin hoti he
 a near-constant arrangement can persist to some extent, so that the fluid also has an equal number of molecules around each molecule
 eks-kiran vivartan ke prayogon dwaara is prakaar kii nikat paraas vyavastha kii upasthiti vaigyanikon dwaara pramanit kii ja chuki he

 Earlier studies have mostly used the Lenard Jones potential
 dravon kaa vivar siddhant apekshaakrit naveen siddhant he
 Many fluids are electrophoresis
 inaki chaalakata kaa kaaran yah he ki inamen swatantra electron paae jate hai
 The electrodensity of liquid salts depends on their ionization
 anya drav do mukhya bhaagon main baante ja sakate hai
 Fluids that are attracted to the existing object are called polar and those that are not attracted are called inelastic
 vaastaviktaa yah he ki dhruviya dravon ke anu main sthaayee rup se kuch dvadhruv-aghurna hote hai, paratu adhruviya dravon ke anuon main aisa nahin hota
 Benzene is a polar fluid
 adhruviya dravon kaa paravaidyuthank 1 or 3 ke bich main paaya jaataa he
 Their field of view is equal to the square root of their radio frequency reflectance
 dhruviya dravon ke paravaidyuthank adhruviya dravon ke paravaidyutankon kii apeksha lagbhag 10 se 100 guna adhik hote hai, kintu inkaa vartanaank lagbhag utana hi hota he
 Fluids are generally isotropic
 dravon ke varnakram inhen padaarthon ke gasiy aanvik varnakramon se bahut kuch milte julate hai
 But the Raman and infrared spectrum of liquids are somewhat different from the corresponding gaseous spectrum

 There are two methods of thinking regarding the motion of the sphere within the placenta
 1
 american paddati or 2
 british paddati
 The American method relies on the following formula, called the formula of the boy V= ax / b+x Here v is the speed of the sphere, the distance traversed by the sphere within the x cord and a and b are two constants
 yah saralata se dikhaaya ja saktaa he ki is nikaay main daab p tathaa mahatta daab Pmax nimnlikhit sutara se praapt hote hai: Here w is the weight of the sphere, a is the area of the transverse cut of the placenta and g is the normal gravity of the earth

 malvagan pracheen bharat kii ek jativishesh kaa sangh
 There are mentions of Malavas in Mahabharata
 apni padosi jati kshudrakon kii tarah maalav ke ullekh milte hai
 The Malavas, like their neighboring caste nomads, fought on behalf of the Kauravas in the Mahabharata war
 ve punjab main nivas karte the jahaan unki tarah anwasht, yodhey aadi janon kaa bhi awaas tha
 Later they remained the same for several centuries
 unani samraat sikandar ke akraman ke samay malvagan kaa rajya mukhyatya raavi or chinab ke doaab main tha
 The kingdom of the natives was attached to the kingdom of the Malavas
 atev malwon ne kshudrakon ke saath sudrudh aikya sthapit kiya tha
 Both the armies faced Alexander with valor and determination
 unani itihaaskaar arian ke anusaar punjab main nivas kar rahi bhartiya jatiyon main maalav or kshudrak sankhya main bahut adhik tathaa sabase adhik yudhkushal the
 Therefore, the Greek army was also hesitant to face his forces, due to which Alexander himself had to move forward and he was particularly hurt in that war
 ant main maalav parajeet hue or unhen hathiyaar daalane pade
 According to Panini, the Malavganas were an 'ordnance' union
 yudhvidya main nipunata praapt karnaa is sangh ke prayek naagarik kaa pradhan kartavya hota tha, at: vahaan sabhi nivasee yoddha hua karte the
 The society of Malavas had reached its full and developed stage
 usamen kshatriya, brahman aadi kai varg hote the
 There were many classes of people who were Kshatriyas or Brahmins etc
 and people of other classes were called 'malavya'
 malvaganon kaa adhikarashetra bahut vistrut or sanghathan ati balashaali tha jisase unako parajeet karnaa kathin hota tha
 Katyayan and Patanjali have also mentioned the petty Malawi army
 iske baad kshudrakon kaa kahin koi ullekh nahin miltaa, jisase yahi anumaan hota he ki sikandar ke akraman ke samay sthapit 'maalav-kshudrak aikya' samay paakar adhikadhik badhata hi gaya or ant main kshudrak malwon main hi purnataya samavisht ho gaye
 After the fall of the Mauryan Empire, when the Bakhtri and Parthv kings established the suzerainty over Punjab and Sindh, seeing the independence and self-rule endangered, the Malavgana forced Punjab to leave the southeast in the second century BCE
 satluj parkar pehle kuch kaal tak ve phiraajpur, ludhiana or bhatinda ke pradesh main rahe, jisase vah kshetra ab tak 'maalav' kehalaata he
 But here also he could not stay for long and in the same century he moved from Ajmer to the region of Tonk Mewar in the southeast and established his independent republic there
 tonk se koi 25 mile dakshin main sthit karkot nagar naamak sthaan unka mukhya kenndra rahaa hoga, vahaan malwon ke vibhinn kaalon ke saikadon sikke praapt hue hai
 With the rise of the Kushan Empire, the western satraps under them in Gujarat conquered Ujjain and established their suzerainty over the Malavas
 jain granthon ke anusaar shakon ko vahaan laane main kalkacharya kaa vishesh haath tha
 But the freedom loving Malavs continued to revolt
 uttam bhadron ke sahaytarth mahakshatrap nahapaan ko ushavadaatt ke netritv main malwon ke viruddh sena bhejni padi thi
 Finally, with the cooperation of the Malavas, Gautamiputra Shatakani killed the great ruler of Mahakshatrapah Nahapan and his companions
 nahapaan or gautamiputra shatakarni ke sahi san sanwaton ke bare main itihaaskaar ekamat nahin he
 According to some historians, even earlier, the head of a branch of the Malavagans, the son of Ujjain's over-commander Girdabhilla, Vikram defeated and removed Shakas from that region
 yadhyapi baad main shakon ne unpar pun: aadhipaty sthapit kar liya tha tathaapi teesri shatee ke prarambh main shri som ke netritv main unhone phir maalav ganraajya kii swadhinata ghoshit kar di
 The Malavganas spread from Karkot Nagar in the south to the whole region, which later became known as Malwa Pradesh in his name
 malwon ke is ganraajya main shashan vyavastha unke chune hue pramukh ke haath main rahati thi
 At times the dynasty's choice of successor was also traditional
 parantu unamem ganatantreey parampara prabal rahi
 Many coins of Malavas have been received
 ye praaia chote hote the
 There are two types of coins of Malavas
 pratham prakaar ke sikkon par malwon ne apni mahatvapurn vijay kii smriti main brahyi lipi main malwanaa jai: or malvaganasya jai: lekh ankit kiye the
 These would have been issued from the first century BCE to the third century BCE
 duusare prakaar ke sikkon par majup, mapojay, magajas, magojay, mapak, pach, gajav, maraj, jamuk aadi shabd ankit hai
 There is no consensus among scholars about the correct meaning or satisfactory meaning of these words
 isa kii chauthi shatabdi ke purvardh main jab samudragupta ne digvijay kar apane vistrut samrajya kii sthapana kii, usne malwon ke ganraajya ko bhi apane adheen kar liya, tadantar malwon ke is ganraajya kii aatanrik swadhinata kuch kaal tak avashya bani rahi hogi
 But the whole region of Malavgan was also submerged in the invasion of barbaric Huns during the fall of Gupta Empire
 malwon ne malwa pradesh ko ekta or mahatvapurn paramparaayen pradaan kin
 This region was earlier divided into two different parts, the western part was called Avantika Kshetra and the eastern part was known by the name or Dasharana
 ve donon ab malwa pradesh main sammilit hokar abhinn ho gaye
 Malavgan's love of freedom and democratic sentiments got integrated with the cultural features of this region
 is prakaar jis nai vistrut raajnneetik tathaa saanskrithik ikai kaa nirmaan hua, aage chalakar uskaa bhartiya itihaas main sadaiv vishesh mahatv rahata aayaa he
 Yashodharman Munj and Bhoja were the earliest episodes of the same new inclusive tradition
 malvagan kii duusari dein rashtriya mahatv kii he, vah he unka maalav sanwat jo aage chalakar vikram sanwat ke rup main bharat main sarvatra prachlit hua
 This Samvat would have started in memory of the independence of the Republic of Malav
 isa kii teesri shatee ke purvardh se hi rajasthan, malwa tathaa unke padosi pradeshon ke shilalekhon main 'krit sanwat' ke naam se is sanwat kaa ullekh miltaa he
 After the fifth century of Christ, it was also written as 'malava' or 'malvesh' Samvat in the inscriptions
 isa kii dasvin shatabdi ke baad yahi sanwat 'vikram sanwat' ke naam se sugyaat hua
 According to the traditional argument, this Malava or Vikram Samvat started from the time of the victory of the majestic Shakari king Vikram of Ujjain
 bardia kii ladaai teen dinon main 3 or 5 ke bich 1941 janvari ladi gayi thi
