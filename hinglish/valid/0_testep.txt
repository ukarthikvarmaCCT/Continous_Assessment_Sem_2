84 upkarnon - madhyamon kii pavitrataganesh or saraswati pujan ke uparant shiksha ke upkarnon- dawaat, kalam or pattee kaa pujan kiya jaataa he
 These three are the main tools for education
 inhen vedamantron se abhimantrit kiya jaataa he, taaki unka praarambhik prabhaav kalyankari ho sake
 To get help in learning
 mantron se in teenon ko pavitra abhimantrit kiya jaataa he, taaki in upkarnon main pavitrataa sthir rakhi ja sake
 The purity of the equipment is essential in every task
 saadhan pavitra honge, to hi saadhy kii utkrushtataa kaayam rakhi ja sakegi
 By wrong measures, even if any success can be obtained from the contaminated equipment, the benefit of that success is not as pleasurable, as impaired in adopting inappropriate mediums creates far-reaching harm and harm
 jis prakaar svachh bartan main rakhaa hua doodh hi pine yogya hota he, maile-gande batarn main rakhane se vah fat jaataa he or pine par rog vikaar utpann karata he, usee prakaar anupyukt upkarnon se jo bhi kaary kiya jaataa he, vah baahar se kitna hi acha kyon na dikhta ho, kitna hi jaldi safal kyon na hua ho, avaanchhneeya he
 The purpose of the Vidyarambha ceremony is to attract the attention of the learner towards the importance of learning and the purity of the equipment
 adhyayan to nimitt maatr he, vastutah upkarnon kii pavitrataa yah ek adashar drushtikon he, jise har kshetra main apanaaya janaa chahie
 Whatever action, behavior and experimentation we do, keep in mind that inappropriate means are not used in any temptation or hurry
 apana har upkaran puri tarah pavitra rahe
 The three presiding deities of education - based on the beliefs of the science of worship, have been considered as the 'goddess' affirmation of Kalam's presiding goddess 'dhriti' and 'priti', the presiding goddess of Patti
 shodash maatrikaaon main dhruthi, pushti tathaa tushti teen deviyaan un teen bhaawanaaon kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai, jo vidya prapti ke liye aadharbhoot hai
 In the Vidyarambha rite, while uttering the mantra of pen-worship, Dhriti is invoked
 nidharrit mantron main unheen kii vandana, abhyathrna kii gayi he
 One has to take a pen first while starting the experiment
 kalam kii devi dhruthi kaa bhav he 'abhiruchi'
 If there is interest in the student's conscience, then all the means of progress will continue to be made
 bina ruchi jaagrath hue padhanaa hi nahin, koi bhi kaam bhaar rup prathit hota he, usamen man nahin lagata, adhure man se kiye hue kaam to ast-vyast evam betuke rahete hai
 There is no significant success in such a situation
 teevr buddhi or badhiya mastishk bhi tab kuch vishesh upyogi siddh nahin hote, kintu yadi padhane main teevr abhiruchi ho, to mand buddhi bhi apane adhyavsaay ke bal par aashshajanak pragati kar lete hai
 It is the duty of parents to awaken the interest of the learner, tell him the benefits of learning
 unke udhaaharan sunaaen, jo padhe-likhe hone ke kaaran unchi sthiti praapt karne main dhan, yash evam suvidha-saadhan upajirt kar sakane main safal hue
 At the same time, such examples should be recounted, in which the boys, satisfied with the means of family happiness, neglected to read and in the end when the resources were scattered, they had to face difficulty in finding the means of living on the basis of their uneducated, underdeveloped personality
 shiksha manushyatv kaa sammaan he or ashikshit hona apmaan
 Being uneducated or self-educated is considered to be a proof of a person's fall in family or personality level
 is apmaan se har kisi ko bachanaa va bachaaya janaa chahie
 While conducting the 'driti' project, the pen should be worshiped in such a way that the interest of the learner continues to grow in studies
 pujan saamagree balak ke haath main di jaae
 On the pen installed at the outpost of worship, it should be offered devoutly with a mantra
 bhaavana kii jaae ki dhruthi shakti balak kii vidya ke prati abhiruchi ko parishkrut kar rahi he

30 kalam kaa upyog dawaat ke dwaara hota he
 The pen can write anything with the help of ink or chalk
 isliye kalam ke baad dawaat ke pujan kaa nambar aata he
 Devaat's presiding deity is 'virmana'
 pushti kaa bhav he-ekaagratha
 By concentration, the process of study is dynamic
 kitne hi vyakti teevr buddhi ke hote hai, mastishk badhiya kaam karata he, padhanaa bhi chaahate hai, par man anek dishaao main bhaaga phirata he, ekagra nahin hota, chanchalta bhari rahati he, prastut vishay main chitt jamata nahin
 The progress of a learner with such a violent mind remains doubtful
 jab chitt lagegaa hi nahin, to mastishk pakadega kya? armbh main mand buddhi samajhe jane vaale shikshaarthi aage chalakar bahut hi pratibhavan siddh hote hue bhi dekhe gayi hai
 Their concentration is the main reason behind the amazing change
 dawaat ke kanth main kalava bandha jaataa he va roli, dhoop, akshat, pushp aadi se pujan kiya jaataa he
 This is the celebration of 'confirmation', the presiding goddess of Dawat
 is puja kaa prayojan yah he ki shikshaarthi ko ekaagratha kaa mahatva samajhaayaa janaa chahie or iskaa use vyaavhaarik abhyaas bhi karaayaa janaa chahie
 If there is sufficient amount of interest and at the same time concentration is practiced, then promising success in the direction of learning is possible
 puja vedi par sthapit dawaat par balak ke haath se mantrocchar ke saath pujan saamagree apirt karai jaae
 It is to be realized that the intensity and concentration of intelligence is being achieved in the child by the affinity of the confirmation power

41 upkarnon main teesraa pujan pattee kaa he
 Once the pen, dawat is arranged, it is used only on bandage or copy paper, their presiding officer is 'sati'
 tushti kaa bhav he-shramshilataa
 For study, labor is as much required as interest and concentration
 kisi chaatr kii padhane main abhiruchi bhi he, chitt bhi ekagra kar letaa he, par aalsee swabhaav hone ke kaaran parishram nahin karata, jaldi ub jaataa he or padhai band karke duusare kaam main lag jaataa he, to der tak lagaataar mehnat na karne kaa durgun uski anya visheshtaon par pani pher detaa he
 Just as the success of physical constructive tasks depends on physical labor, similarly mental achievements are dependent on mental labor
 shram ke bina is sansar main kuch bhi praapt nahin kiya ja saktaa
 No matter how abundant and abundant the resources are, their benefits will be given only when they are used
 upyog main shram upekshit he
 Therefore, the learner should also be hardworking
 use padhane main ji lagaakar mehnat karne kaa abhyaas bananaa chahie
 Parents should remedy this habit as it happens
 pattee, dawaat, kalam teenon upkarnon kaa pujan karne ke saath-saath yah tathy bhi hridyangam kiya jaataa he ki hamaare sabhi saadhan pavitra hon
 Knowledge should also be obtained by sacred means for the fulfillment of sacred purposes
 abhiruchi ekaagratha or shramshilataa kaa aadhaar lekar vidya laabh ke mahatvapurn maarg par badha jaae
 Puja material should be made available by the child on the strip installed at the place of worship with chanting
 bhaavana kii jaae ki is aradhana se balak tushti shakti se sampakar sthapit kar rahaa he
 With that power, the ability to work hard and practice will be developed

 Just as cow feeds her calf, similarly, the guru feeds her disciple nectar of learning
 is prakriya main paraspar shraddha-sadbhaavna ko hona aavashyak he
 If there is no love between the cow and the calf, how does the process of feeding go? Similarly, if you do not have respect for the learner, then the work of teaching with attitude with the upper mind will remain immaterial
 jis prakaar gadhi kamai kaa paisa hi faltaa-phulataa he, usee prakaar guru ke prati shraddha, sadbhaavna rakhkar uskaa sneh vatsalya praapt karte hue jo siikhaa jaataa he, vah jivan main laabhadaayak siddh hota he
 By teaching mutual disregard, indifference or self-pity, contempt does not only teach one, if it comes, it does not thrive

 Mother is called Brahma, father is Vishnu and Guru is called Mahesh
 vah teenon hi devataaon kii tarah shraddha, sammaan ke paatr hai
 Therefore, Guru Poojan is considered an organ in Vidyarambha rites
 kalam, dawaat, pattee kaa pujan karne ke uparant shiksha armbh karne vaale guru ko pushp, maala, kalava, tilak, aarti, fal aadi kii shradhanjali apirt karte hue pujan kar namaskara karnaa chahie
 The purpose of this worship is that the learner should have respect for his teachers like father, greet them from time to time, take proper courtesy, observe discipline and behave as he instructs
 apane parishram or shishtachar se unhen prasann rakhane kaa prayatan kare
 Similarly, it is also the duty of the teacher to treat the learner like his son, not only to provide him with alphabetic knowledge, but also to provide him with affection, harmony and good faith
 mantra ke saath balak dwaara guru ke abhaav main unke pratik kaa pujan karaayaa jaae
 It should be realized that these disciple-like qualities are developing in the child through this process of reverence

 haalanki, sachai to aisi nahin he, phir bhi iske itane aayam, itane pahalu hai ki logabagh kai baar ise lekar bhramit ho jate hai
 The biggest reason for this is that Sanatan Dharma is not a product of the views of any one philosopher, Manisha or Rishi, nor was it born at any particular time
 yah to anadi kaal se pravaahman or vikasman rahaa
 Also, it does not even give preference to only one vision, theory or logic

 Navinavit or dock or 'dock' is the place of stay of vessels
 yadi sthaan puri tarah ghira hua nahin he, balki uskaa mukh samudr se aane jane ke liye sadaa khulaa rahata he, to uske liye 'basin' naam adhik upyukt he, yadhyapi yah naam sarvyaapee nahin he
 There are gates or chambers installed on the mouth of the docks, so that water can be kept in them to the desired level
 jis godi main pani praaia: ek hi tal tak rahata he, vah sajal godi kehalaati he tathaa jis godi main se pani bilkul khaali kiya ja saktaa he, vah 'sukhi godi' kehalaati he
 Ships are brought to the dry dock for inspection or repair
 sukhi godi kaa hi ek rup 'tirti godi' he
 It is a structure of large floating pus, which can be lowered or elevated by filling, or emptying, and the vessel can be placed over it and lifted over the water
 jin pattanon main prakrutipradutt surakshit or gaharaa vishaal basin hota he, jowarbhata kam aata he or samudr main tej dharaayen nahin hotin, vahaan sajal godi kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti, jaise neuyork main
 But dry or sloping dock is an essential part of all major modern ports
 samudratat yaa naditat par prakritik yaa gahari khodi hui upakhaadi hoti he, jiske kinare jahaajon main maal ladane yaa utaarne ke liye pakke ghat yaa platfarm bane hote hai
 If they are parallel to the coast, it is called Parshghat or Push
 or yadi jal main pravesh karte hue tat ke lambavatathwa anya kisi kone par bane hote hai, to paae kehalaate hai
 Ghats, Dhaks or Paia Sajal are the main parts of the dock
 kabhi kabhi tirte ghat bhi banaae jate hai, jo jowar bhaate ke saath unche neeche ho sakate hai
 They are connected to the fixed ghats by mobile bridges
 godi kii deevaaren bahut majboot banaai jaati hai
 These are usually of corrugated concrete, monolithic concrete, compressed air-fired chambers, reinforced concrete with porous drum, or composite walls of slabs, drums, etc
 inke upar praaia: granite kii sheershika avashya rahati he
 Nowadays, ships are often boxed
 unki deevaaren sidhi khadi rahati hai yaa kabhi kabhi upar kii ore bheetar ko jhuki rahati hai
 Therefore the walls of the ghat are built either vertically or almost vertically at the front, so that ships can come very close to the ghat and be within reach of the loading cranes
 deevaaren pushton kii bhanti banaai jaati hai, jinaki peeche kii sataha dhaalu yaa seedhidaar rahati he
 Their foundation is very wide, so that the soil below does not overload its capacity
 neenv peeche kii ore kuch dhaalu bhi rakhi jaati he, taaki bharaai kaa dabaav padane par diwaar kii ore khisak na jaae
 The walls are designed by taking care of the fixed weight of the wall and the filling of the back
 inaki ausat motaai, oonchaai kii chauthai se kam nahin hoti, praaia: ek tihaai rakhi jaati he
 The width at the base varies from half to two-thirds of the height
 diwaar main lagbhag 50-50 foot par jalchhidr rakhe jate hai, taaki jab saamne pani kaa tal nicha ho tab peeche kaa pani nikal sake
 Where the tide ebbs are very high, large basins are often enclosed and closed and large gates are installed to keep the water on the same floor
 jowar ke baad jab bhaata aarambh hota he, tab ye phatak band kar die jate hai, jisase godi main pani unchaa rah jaataa he
 These types of gandis are called 'closed laps'
 praveshdvara ke phatak main do palle hote hai, jo band hone par ek uthi hui dehal ke upar paraspar mil jate hai
 The gate is very long
 isaki deevaaron main chaude chaude khaanche hote hai, jisamen palle khulkar ghus jate hai
 When the gate is closed, the walls also act as a pavement to prevent the water flow falling on it
 ye phatak keval thode samay ke liye hi, arthath jab jowar aata he tabhi, khole ja sakate hai
 So there can be limited traffic
 icchaanusaar avaagaman sambhav ke liye dwaara bahut lanbaa banaaya Goes and gates are placed at both its ends
 isse bich main ek jalpash ban jaataa he - usee prakaar kaa jaisaa naharon main jhiilon ke nikat yatayaat ke liye hota he
 Water pots are expensive and surround the place rather than the gate, but can be useful day and night
 isliye aadhunik bade pattanon main praaia: ye hi banaae jate hai
 If there are single gates in them, then only in the form of auxiliary doors
 jalpash kaa pani unchaa yaa nicha karne ke liye bagali deevaaron main bade bade jalakapaat yaa puliyaan hoti hai
 Modern large water vessels often have a gate in the middle, so that two parts of the water vessel can be made and small vessels can be placed in them
 jahaan praveshdvara par bahut hi unchaa jowar aata he yaa bheeshan lehren uthati hai, vahaan phatakon kii raksha ke liye unase vipareet disha main khulanevaala ek phatak baahar kii ore laga diya jaataa he
 This is called the storm gate
 godi ke phatak lakdi yaa ispaat ke hote hai
 Greenwoods, Jarrahs, or other heavy and hardwoods are planted in them
 lohe par khaare pani kaa bura prabhaav padataa he or yadi usamen malajal mila ho, to or bhi adhik
 Therefore, steel gates last only about 30 years, while wood gates last about 50 years
 lakdi ke phatakon kaa bhaar bhi kam hota he
 The Liverpool dock gate is 90 feet wide and feet high
 iskaa harihrit kaa ek pallaa vajan main keval 165 ton he, jabaki landan ke 80 foot chaude, foot unche phatak kaa ispaat kaa ek pallaa 185 ton kaa he
 The cost of wooden gates is about 50 percent more than that of steel gates: ye phatakon se achche samajhe jate hai, kyonki inako sthaan dene ke liye deevaaron main bade bade khaanche rakhane kii aavashyaktaa nahin rahati
 In the cells, there is a contact surface of green wall on the side and bottom, which is covered with rubber so that it fits in the door and stops the water
 aavashyaktaanusaar inkaa bhaar kam zyada karne ke liye inke bheetar pani kii tankiyan bani rahati hai or unhen yaa khaali karne ke liye pump, valve aadi lage rahete hai
 There are two types of doorways: ye chaukor bhi ho sakati hai, kintu adhiktar jahaajon kii akruti jaisi hoti hai
 They do not have any specified driving system, but are swam and taken to the place
 kshubgh mausam main, yaa teevr dhara main, inhen sanbhaalanaa aasaan nahin hota
 They are square and are of two types, according to the specified conduction system - wooden clusters are placed in the sliding chambers, forcing them to move to the place on the way over the masonry
 duusare prakaar kii pahievaali kothiyaan hoti hai, jo dehal par lagi patariyon par chalati hai
 Sometimes the wheels are on the floor and the tracks are in the closets
 pargami kothiyaan jab dwaar kholane ke liye khiskaai jaati hai, tab ve diwaar ke bheetar bani lambii lambii jhirriyon main ghus jaati hai
 In dry docks, there is an arrangement to bring one or more ships inside, close the gates and drain the water by pumps
 isaki deevaaron or pende par jalaabhedya padaarth, jaise kancreet-sahit itan kii chinai yaa granite mukhai, kaa astr kiya rahata he
 Where high tides come in the ebb, sometimes they take advantage of them and bring the ship in during the tide and close the gates after the ebb

 Dry basins are considered essential for construction, inspection and repair etc
 of ships and scope for future expansion at the time of their design

 But due to iron or steel, they do not last more than 30-40 years
 inke liye surakshit sthaan bhi chahie or adhik gaharaai bhi
 Where a dry dock of 520 feet long, 60 feet wide and 30 feet deep will suffice for a sinking ship 500 feet long, 55 feet wide and 28 feet, the sloping dock shall take another 20 feet deep to go under the ship; And if the tide is 15-20 feet high, then about 70 feet deep water is required for the sloping dock
 yadi kudarti gaharaai itani nahin he, to talkarshan dwaara itani kerani padegi
 Under normal circumstances, it is not only difficult, but often impossible

 is lihaaj se kshetrafal ke anusaar yah sanyukt rajya america kaa chaudaavaan sabase bada shahar he
 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft 
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether causes approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 However, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; The city is situated in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 °C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 °F warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 ° F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 ° F, with overnight lows of 63 ° F
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 ° F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 ° f and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34 ° north
 The median temperature in January is 57 °F and 73 °F in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 °F in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 °F in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 °F on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 °F on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical Coral Tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the Bird of Paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles

 iske tahat bhartiya sainik yah sandesh dena chaahate the ki bharat ke kendra dilli main videshi nahin balki bhartiya shaasha kii satta chalegi
 Bahadur Shah Zafar's order to ban cow slaughter after becoming a king was not a new order

 Zafar had merely started following this order again

 However, the Disaster Management Group in Delhi directed the officials at the Amritsar airport to ensure that the aircraft was stationary, where armed personnel of the Punjab Police were already present for the effort

 a fuel tanker was eventually dispatched and instructed to cease access to the aircraft
 jaise hi tanker vimaan kii ore bhaaga, hawaii yatayaat niyantran ne payalat ko dhimaa karne kaa radio sandesh bheja or tanker turant ruk gaya
 The sudden halt thus increased suspicion of the hijackers and forced them to immediately take the aircraft away from the air traffic control without clearance
 tanker vimaan se kuch hi feet kii duuri par rah gaya tha
 The aircraft requested an emergency landing in Lahore, Pakistan due to the extremely low fuel level
 pakistan ne is dar se anurodh ko thukraa diya ki aatankwaadiyon ke saath unke desh kaa naam joda ja saktaa tha
 Pakistan also shut down its air traffic services, thus effectively managing the entire Pakistan airspace for Indian Airlines flight and all the lights at Lahore airport were switched off

 After realizing that the only other option for the aircraft was to be dashed to the ground, the Lahore airport turned on its lights and allowed the aircraft to land

 Since India did not recognize the Taliban-regime, it sent an officer from its High Commission in Islamabad to Kandahar
 The negotiation process was complicated by India's lack of prior contact with the Taliban-government
 haalanki taliban kaa iraadaa tab andeh ke daayre main aa gaya jab iske sashastr ladaakon ne apahrit vimaan ko gher liya
 The Taliban maintained that military forces were deployed in an attempt to prevent the hijackers from killing or injuring hostages, but some analysts believe this was done to halt the Indian military operation against the hijackers

 kisi prakaar kaa uttar na milane par inhone 3 may, 1944 se apana aitihaasik aamaran anshan shuru kar diya

 sarkaar kathith rup se dafan is swarna bhandar kii khudaai karwaane ke liye khanan mantralay or bhartiya puraatatva surveykshan vibhaag ko raji karne main sakasham rahe
 Excavation work started on 18 October 2013
 28 oktober somvaar shaam tak kul 4
8 meter tak khudaai kii ja chuki thi
 However, according to some reports, the excavation work was done on a scientific basis, not on the basis of dreams, in which the presence of a 'non-magnetic' element was estimated
 eesai kii nigaraanee main ho rahi khudaai ke liye kile ko 2 khandon main baanta gaya tha
 The excavation of one section was completed by 13 November, while about 75 percent of the excavation of the second block was completed, but no trace of the treasure was found

 The government meditated for 8 years under Swamiji's guidance
 14 navambar 2013 ko unnav ke dondiakheda main sone kii khudaai antat aupchaarik rup se band kar di gai
 The Archaeological Survey of India called it a lesson of a lifetime
 haalanki shobhan sarkaar kii taraf se kaha gaya ki khajaane kii talash vaigyanik nazariye se ho rahi he, jabaki yah aloukikta se judaa maamla he
 He said that gold will come out in the excavation and he will remove it after ASI team leaves from Daundiyakheda village
 thanela rog dudharu pashuon ko lagane vaala ek rog he
 In the beginning of the disease, the udder gets warm and the pain and swelling in the animals affected by thanilla disease
 shaareerik taapmaana bhi bad jaataa hai
 The quality of milk is affected as soon as symptoms appear
 doodh main chhatka, khun evam peebh kii adhikta ho jaati hai
 The animal stops eating and drinking and suffers from anorexia
 yah beemaari samanytah gaay, bhens, bakrii evam boar samet takreeban sabhi vaise pashuon main paayi jaati he, jo apane bacchon ko doodh pilaatin hai
 Thanela disease is caused by various types of bacteria, virus, mold and yeast and mold infection in animals
 iske alaava chot tathaa mausami pratikultaaon ke kaaran bhi thanaila ho jaataa hai
 Since ancient times, this disease has been a matter of concern for milking animals and their livestock
 pashu dhan vikaas ke saath shwet kranti kii purna safalataa main akele yah beemaari sabase badi baadhak hai
 This disease causes loss of crores of rupees every year across India, which ultimately affects the economic condition of the livestock
 alakshanik yaa upalakshanik prakaar ke rog main than va doodh bilkul saamaanya prathit hote hai lekin prayogshaala main doodh kii jaanch dwaara rog kaa nidaan kiya ja saktaa he
 In symptomatic diseases, in some animals, milk only causes pus / sputum or blood etc
 and the udder appears to be almost normal, in some animals milk is found to be abnormal along with swelling or stiffness / heat in the udder
 kuch asaamaanya prakaar ke rog main than sad kar gir jaataa he
 Most animals do not have fever etc
 rog kaa upachaar samay par na karaane se than kii saamaanya sujan bad kar aparivartaneey ho jaati he or than lakdi kii tarah kada ho jaataa he
 After this stage milk from the udder stops permanently
 saamanytah prarambh main menek yaa do than prabhavit hote hai jo ki baad main anya thanon main bhi rog fail saktaa he
 In some animals, the taste of milk turns salty
 is adrishy prakaar kii beemaari ko samay rahete pahchaanane ke liye nimna prakaar ke upaay kiye ja sakate hai
 Apart from this, proper maintenance of animals, use of medicines which increase disease resistance of udder and timely treatment of diseases are best
 rog kaa safal upachaar praarambhik avasthaaon main hi sambhav he anyathaa rog ke bad jane par than bachaa paanaa kathin ho jaataa he
 To avoid this, milk of animal milk should be checked on time and treatment with bactericidal drugs should be done by the veterinarian
 praayah yah aushadhiyaan than main tub chadhaa kar tathaa saath hi mansapeshi main injection dwaara di jaati he
 Animal milk is not drinkable during treatment by mounting tubes in the udder
 atah antim tub chadhne ke 48 ghante baad tak kaa doodh prayog main nahin laana chahie
 It is very important that the treatment is done completely, do not leave it in the middle
 iske atirikt yah aashaa nahin rakhni chahie ki vartmaan byaant main pashu upachaar ke baad punah saamaanya puraa doodh dene lag jayega
 In order to effectively prevent thanilla disease, it is necessary to pay attention to the following points
 1
 pashuon ke baandhe jane vaale sthaan / baithne ke sthaan va doodh duhane ke sthaan kii safai kaa vishesh dhyaan rakhen
 2
 The technique of milking should be corrected so that there is no injury to the udder
 3
 than main kisi prakaar kii chot kaa samuchit upachaar turant karaayen
 4
 Treatment of udder before and after milking by immersing it in the medicine solution
 5
 doodh kii dhar kabhi bhi farsh par na maaren
 6
 Periodically check the milk or get it done in the laboratory
 7
 shushk pashu upachaar bhi byaanne ke baad thanaila rog hone kii sambhaavna lagbhag samaapt kar detaa he
 Contact the vet for this
 8
 rogi pashuon ko swasth pashuon se alag rakhen tathaa unhen duhane vaale bhi alag hon
 If this is not possible, then the diseased animal should be milked at the end

 aise nakshe ke liye f kaa sambandh s kii us punarvyavastha se he jisamen s tatv apane bimb f kaa sthaan le letaa he
 In combinatorics, a permutation of a finite set s is defined as a listed rearrangement of its elements
 is arth main, s kaa kramchay uske tatwon kii punarvyavastha se bhinn he
 For the initial order set S, such as s =, these two meanings are almost recognizable: Applying a permutation in the first sense to this initial order gives an alternate sequence of elements, which is a permutation in the second sense
 kisi vastu ke bhaagon kii punarvyavastha ke kaary ko, yaa usase praapt parinaam ko namit karne ke liye anaupchaarik rup se kramparivartan shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Thus the alphabet of a word can also be defined as a permutation of its characters, or say x 3Y + 7 + y 2Z is a permutation of terms of the polynomial x 3Y + y 2Z +7
 kramparivartan ke kaary ko pratikon kaa pratisthaapan bhi kaha ja saktaa he, udhaaharan ke liye jab kehete hai ki X, Y, z kii char raashi ke kramparivartan dwaara x 3Y +Y 2Z +7 se y 3Z +Z 2X +7 praapt hota he
 These statements can be given precise meaning keeping in mind an appropriate symmetric collective action
 combinetorics main "kramparivartan" ke duusare arth ko kabhi kabhi vistrut kiya jaataa he
 In primary combinatorics, "permutation and conjunction" refers to two related problems, both of which depend on the probability of selecting a specific k element from a set of n elements, the order of selection for the k permutation is taken into account, But is ignored for k-combinations
 darasal k -kramparivartan kii gananaa kaa prayog k -sangyojan ke number { \ displaystyle { \ tbinom {n}{k}}} kii gananaa kii disha main ek kadam ke rup main kiya jaataa he or set ke kramparivartan kii sankhya n ! kii gananaa ke rup main bhi hota he
 However k-permutations do not correspond to such permutations unless k = n, that is, the selection includes all available elements
 To broaden the notion of permutation differently, one can start with a finite multiset m in place of a set S, in which some values occur more than once
 The permutation of m is a sequence of elements of m each of which occurs exactly as many times as in M
 Thus for m =, the sequence of is a multiset permutation of M, but is not
 lagbhag ganit ke prayek kshetra main, kramparivartan kamobesh pramukh rup se hote hai
 They are generated by applying different sequences to a finite set, possibly because we want to find out how many configurations are thus identified, ignoring such a sequence
 isi tarah ke kaarnon se computer vigyaan main kalan ganit kii chhantai ke adhyayan main kramparivartan ghatit hota he
 In algebra, an entire topic has been devoted to a detailed study of permutations through the concept of isometric grouping
 isaki sanrachana ke liye mahatvapurn he kramparivartan kii rachana kii sambhaavna: anuvarthi kram main do punarvyavasthaaon ko nishpadit karte hue, sangyojan teesri punarvyavastha ko paribhaashit karata he
 n The rule for determining the number of permutations of an object was available in Hindu culture around 1150: there is a passage in Lilavati by Indian mathematician Bhaskar which translates ikai se shuru or vriddhimaan or kai sthanon ke liye jari ankaganitiya shrinkhalaa ke bahugunan kaa utpaada, vishisht sankhya vaale ankon kaa roopaantar hoga
 The first case of the first study of unrelated mathematical questions with the help of permutations appeared in 1770, when Joseph Louis lagrange, studying polynomial equations, found that the properties of the permutation of the origin of the equation are related to the probabilities of solving it
 is kaary se hue vikaas kaa parinaam everis galva, ke kaam ke madhyam se, galva siddhant main pratipaadit hua, jo mul dwaara bahupadiy samikarnon ko hal karne main sambhav or asambhav kaa puraa vivaran detaa he
 There are many similar situations in modern mathematics, where the study of related permutations is required to understand the problem
 kramparivartan kii sankalpana kaa prayog nimnlikhit sandarbhon main kiya jaataa he
 In group theory and related fields, there is also a permutation of random sets, infinite
 s kaa swany main dvibhajan set s kaa kramparivartan he
 This permits permutation, which defines groups of permutations
 agar n tatwon kaa parimit set s he, to n ! s kaa kramparivartan he
 In combinatorics, a permutation usually means a sequence consisting of each element once and only once from a finite set
 anukram kii avadharana set se is tarah alag he ki usamen anukram ke tatv ek kram main hote he: anukram kaa pehla tatv hota he, doosraa tatv or isi prakaar kramshah hote chale jate hai
 Conversely, there is no order of elements in a set, and there are different ways of representing the same set
 is arth main n tatwon ke parimit s set kaa kramparivartan se s main dvibhajan, yaa s ke puure kram ke liye chayan ke tulya he
 In this sense, n! The permutation is also of S
 "kramparivartan" shabd kaa ek kamjor arth bhi he jo kabhi-kabhaar praathmik combinetorics granthon main prayog kiya jaataa he, un kramon ko namoddhisht karte hue jinamein koi tatv ek se adhik baar na aae, kintu nirdhaarit set ke sabhi tatwon ke prayog kii aavashyaktaa na pade

 These items are also known as non-repetitive sequences, a term that avoids confusion with other, more common meanings of "permutation"
 n ke aakaar ke ek set kii tatwon ke bina doharaav ke k kram kii lambaai kii sankhya he a number known as the k -th depreciable divisional power of n and with many other names and notations prevalent
 agar m ek parimit multiset he, to ek multiset kramparivartan m tatwon kaa kram he jisamen prayek tatv utani baar prakat hota he jitani baar m main isaki bahulata he
 If the plurality of elements of m is m 1 { \ displaystyle m_ {1}}, m 2 { \ displaystyle m_ {2}}, 


, ml { \ displaystyle m_ {l}} and their sum is n, then m The number of multiset permutations of is given by the polynomial coefficient samooh siddhant main, ek set ke kramparivartan kaa arth he ek dwibhajit nakshaa, yaa us set se swany main dvibhajan

 It is a isometric group of S
 samarupata tak, yah samametiya samooh set kii gananeeyata par nirbhar karata he, isliye s tatwon kii prakruti samooh kii sanrachana ke liye apraasangik he
 Symmetric groups have been studied most in the case of finite sets, in which case it can be assumed that s = {1,2, 


, {0} n} for some natural number n, which is n Defines the isometric group of degrees
 samametiya samooh ke kisi bhi upasamooh ko kramparivartan samooh kehete he
 In fact according to Kelly's formula any group corresponds to a permutation group and each finite group is a subgroup of any finite symmetric group
 haalanki, kramparivartan samoohon kii amoort kramparivartan samoohon kii tulana main adhik sanrachana hoti he or kramparivartan samooh ke rup main vibhinn pratiti hoti he isliye samatuly hone kii zarurat nahin he
 There are two main notation methods for permutation of a finite s set
 do-panktiyon vaale ankan main, ek pehali pankti main s ke tatv ko soochibaddh karti he or prayek ke liye kramparivartan ke tahat apane bimb ko duusari pankti main
 udhaaharan ke liye set kaa vishesh kramparivartan is rup main likhaa ja saktaa he: This means that σ satisfies σ = 2, σ = 5, σ = 4, σ = 3 and σ = 1
 vaikalpik rup se, ham chakra ankan kaa upyog kar kramparivartan likh sakate hai, jo kramparivartan ke safal prayog ke prabhaav par kendrit karata he
 It expresses the permutation as the product of a cycle that corresponds to the orbitals of the permutation; Since discrete orbitals are relaxed, this is commonly called the "decomposition of loose cycles" of permutations
 yah is prakaar kaam karata he: s ke kuch x tatv se shuru karkeσ ≠ x, anukram likhte hai σ ke tahat kramik bimb kaa σ ) 


), jab tak bimb x na ho jaae, jis bindu par koshthak band kar die jate hai
 The set of values written forms the orbit of x and the parenthesized expression gives a corresponding cycle of σ
 to s ke x tatv ko chunanaa jari rahata he jo pehle se likhi gai kaksha main nahin he or kiσ ≠ y or sangat chakra ko likhte hai or yah kram jari rahata he jab tak s ke sabhi tatv likhe gaye chakra se sambhddha nahin hote hai yaa σ ke niyat bindu nahin hote
 chunki har nae chakra ke liye prarambh bindu alag alag tareekon se chunaa ja saktaa he, saamanytah ek hi kramparivartan ke liye kai alag alag chakra ankan hai; udhaaharan ke liye upar vaale main ek udhaaharan he Each cycle of σ is in itself a symbol of a permutation, that is, which takes an even value of σ in this orbit, drawing all the elements of s in themselves
 The l shape of the orbit is called the length of the circle
 σ kii pruthak kakshaen paribhaasha se shithil hai, to tadnurupi chakra roopantarit ho jate hai or σ iske chakron kaa utpaada he 
 isliye chakra ankan main chakra ke sangyojan kii kramparivartan kii sanrachana ke ankan ke rup main vyakhya kii ja sakati he, jis kaaran se kramparivartan kaa naam "apghaton"
 yah apghaton anivaary rup se adwitiya he: utpaada main chakron ke punarkram ke alaava, σ ko chakron ke utpaada ke rup main likhane kaa koi tarika nahin he jisaki kakshaen shithil hon
 chakra ankan kam adwitiya he kyonki prayek chakra alag alag tareekon se likhaa ja saktaa he, jaisaa ki uparokt udhaaharan main diya gaya he jahaan jaise chakra ko nirupit karata he kintu ek alag kramparivartan ko nirupit karegaa)
 Shape is not a corresponding circle of a class of 1, since this permutation will fix x as well as every other element of S, in other words it will be identified, independently of x
 It is possible to include the cycle notation so that σ gives the force that σ determines x, but does not correspond to the factor in decomposition of σ
 agar "chakra" kii avadharana main kramparivartan kii pahchaan shaamil karen, to isse shithil chakron main kramparivartan ke apghaton kii adwitiyata nasht ho jaaegi
 pahchaan kramparivartan kaa shithil chakron main apghaton khaali utpaada he; iskaa chakra ankan khaali hoga, isliye isaki bajaae e jaisi ankan paddati istemaal kii jaaegi
 Two cycles of length are called substitutions; Such permutations replace only two elements
 do kramparivartan kaa utpaada kaary ke rup main unki sanrachana ke rup main paribhaashit he, duusare shabdon main σ·π vah kaary he jo set ke kisi bhi x tatv kaa σ ) main chithran karata he
 Note that the rightmost permutation applies to the first argument because of the way the application of the task is written
 kuch lekhak pehle sabase baayen kaarak ko lagu karnaa pasand karte hai, par uske liye kramparivartan unke tark kii daayin ore likhaa janaa chahie, udaahranarth pratipadak ke rup main, x par lagu σ x σ likhaa jaataa he; to utpaada paribhaashit kiya gaya he x σ ·π =π ke dwaara
 haalanki yah kramparivartan guna karne ke liye ek alag niyam detaa he; yah lekh vahaan paribhaasha kaa upyog karata he jahaan sabase daaen kramparivartan ko pehle lagu kiya jaataa he
 Since the structure of two bisections always gives another bisector, the product of two permutations is again a permutation
 kaary sanrachana sahyogaatmak hoti he, isliye kramparivartan par utpaada sanchaalan he:·ρ =σ ·
 isliye kramparivartan ke utpaada aamtaur par koshthak ke bina likhe jate hai or ve aamtaur par ek dot yaa utpaada ko chihnit karne vaale anya nishaan ke bhi bina likhe jate hai The identity permutation, which characterizes each element of the set itself, is the neutral element of this product
 do panktiyon vaale ankan main, pahchaan he Since there are inverses of bisectors, so are the permutations of and the inverse of σ is σ −1 which is again a permutation
 spasht rup se, jab bhi σ =y ek kaa σ −1=x bhi he
 In two-line notation, the inverse can be obtained by interchanging two lines, e
g
 chakra ankan main prayek chakra main tatwon ke kram ko palatney se iske vyutkram ke liye chakra ankan praapt kar sakate hai
 a collaborative product groups a set of all permutations of s from a neutral element and inversely to all its elements, which is called a symmetric group of S
 ek parimit set ke prayek kramparivartan ko pratisthaapan ke utpaada ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 In addition, although many types of expressions may exist for a given permutation, there cannot be an expression with both even and odd number of substitutions between them
 All permutations are classified as even or odd, according to the parity of their substitutions in any expression
 chakra ankan main likhe kramparivartan guna kii vidhi kathin he or utpaada ke chakra sanrachit kiye ja rahe kramparivartan se puri tarah alag ho sakate hai
 However the cycle structure is preserved in the special case of the conjugation of π to the other permutation of the permutation of σ, which means the creation of the product π · σ · π −1
 Here the cycle notation of the result can be obtained by taking the cycle notation of σ and applying π to all its entries
 {1, 2, 


,{0}n} ke kramparivartan kaa n ×n matrix ke rup main pratinidhitiv kiya ja saktaa he
 There are two natural ways of doing this, but only for one is the multiplication of the matrix corresponding to the multiplication of the permutation in the same order: that is, which is the associate of the σ matrix m whose m i, j entry is 1 if i = σ Otherwise 0
 There is exactly 1 entry of the resulting matrix in each column and one in each row
 Such a matrix is called a permutation matrix
 combinetorics main n tatwon ke saath set s kaa kramparivartan kisi kram main s ke tatwon kii suchi he
 It can be defined as a formal bisection from set to S
 dhyaan den ki yadi s ke baraabar he to yah paribhaasha samooh siddhant kii paribhaasha se mail khaati he
 Usually any set equipped with a sequence of elements can be used instead
 combinetoric kaa gun jo kramparivartan kii samooh saidhantik vyakhya se sambandhit he or jise s ke kul kram kaa upyog kiye bina paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he, vah kramparivartan σ kii chakra sanrachana he
 This is the division of σ describing the length of cycles of n
 yahan σ ke har tay bindu ke liye vibhaajan main bhaag "1" he
 a permutation that has no fixed point is called a dislocation
 anya combinetorics ke gun sidhe s ke kram se sambandhit he or jis tarah se kramparivartan isse sambandhit ho

 The ascension of the permutation of σ of n is i σ i +1, so each i with 1 ≤ i { \ displaystyle 1 \ leq i} is either the ascension or descent of σ
 k aaroh ke saath n ke kramparivartan kii sankhya ilurian sankhya ⟨ n k ⟩ { \ displaystyle \ textstyle \ left \ langle {n \ atop k} \ right \ rangle } he, yah bhi k aaroh ke saath n ke kramparivartan kii sankhya he
 a permutation ascending run is a full incremental proximal sequence of permutations that can be extended from both sides, corresponding to the maximum sequence of successive ascensions
 udhaaharan ke liye, kramparivartan 2453167 ke arohi ran 245, 3 or 167 he, jabaki iskaa ek vriddhimaan parinaam 2367 he
 If a permutation has k - 1 descending runs, then it must be the union of the k ascending runs
 Therefore the permutation of n is the same with the ascending run as the number of permutations with ascending k - 1 ⟨nk - 1⟩ { \ displaystyle \ textstyle \ left \ langle {n \ atop k-1} \ right \ rangle} 
 kramparivartan σ kaa vyutkram sthitiyon kii jodi he jisamen kramparivartan kii pravishtiyanulat kram main hai: i { \ displaystyle i} or σ i > σ j { \ displaystyle \ sigma _{i}> \ sigma _{j}} 
 to ek avarohi sirf do asann sthitiyon par ek vyutkram maatr he
 For example, the permutation σ = 23154 has three inversions:,,, pairs of entries,, for
 kabhi kabhi ek vyutkram ko aise mulya ke jode ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jiskaa kram ulat he, isse vyutkram kii sankhya ke liye koi antar nahin padataa or yah joda bhi uparyukt arth main σ −1 ulat kramparivartan kaa vyutkram he
 The number of inversions is an important measure for the degree for which entries of permutations are out of order, the same for σ and σ −1
 k vyutkram vaale kramparivartan ko vvayavasthit karne ke liye, asann pratisthaapan ko kramik rup se lagu karke, sadaiv sambhav he or aise prachaalanon ke k anukram kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Also any reasonable choice of adjacent substitution will work: it is sufficient to choose the substitution of i at every step and where i + 1 i is the descending of the refined permutation so far
 k vyutkram ke saath n ke kramparivartan kii sankhya mahonian sankhya ke dwaara vyakt kii jaati he, yah utpaada ke vistaar main x k kaa gunank he Called q -value q! also known as
 is khand main, set s kaa k -kramparivartan s ke k vishisht tatwon kaa vyavasthit anukram he
 For example, the set of given characters {{1} C, E, G, I, N, R}, the sequence ICE is a 3-permutation, RING and RICE is a 4-permutation, NICER and REIGN are 5-permutations and CRINGE Is a 6-permutation; Since the latter uses all characters, it is a permutation of a given set in the simple combinatorial sense
 n ko s kaa aakaar hone den, chayan ke liye uplabdh tatwon kii sankhya

 isse vishesh rup se n -kramparivartan kii sankhya praapt hoti he yaa isi tarah ke ankan se dyotak hoti he
 That marking is rarely used in contexts other than counting k-permutations, but expressions for numbers arise in many other situations
 haalanki kai anya naam or ankan upyog main hai, jaise ki pochhammer pratik main vistrut hai
 When k ≤ n the factorial power can be met by additional factors: nk ×! daahine haath kii ore aksar k -kramparivartan kii sankhya ke liye abhivyakti ke rup main di jaati he lekin iskaa mukhya gun compact bhajya ankan kaa upyog karnaa he
 In those cases the number of k-permutations is nk bus 0

 Is particularly attractive when n is small enough that n can be captured in the word machine; For 32-bit words it means n ≤ 12 and for 64-bit words it means n ≤ 20
 lehmar code main kramparivartan σ ke liye, sankhya d n pehle pad σ 1 ke liye kiye gaye chunaav kaa pratinidhitiv karti he, sankhya d n −1 pratinidhitiv karti he duusare pad σ 1 ke liye set ke sheshason − 1 tatwon ke bich kiye gaye chunaav kaa or isi prakaar aage bhi
 or spasht shabdon main, prayek d n +1−i shesh tatwon kii sankhya detaa he jo pad σ i se nishchit rup se kam hoti he
 Since those remaining elements are bound to come in the form of a posterior term σ j, the digit dn + 1 − i counts the inverse by adding i as a small index
 The inverse table for σ is quite similar, but here the number of dn + 1 − k inverse counts where k = σ j occurs as the minimum of the two values displayed in the reverse order
 Both notations can be visualized by an n in the n Roth diagram with the point symbol of the entries of the permutation and the cross symbol of the inverse; By the definition of the inverse, the cross falls into any square that is both before the point in its column and the point in its row
 lehmar code uttarotar panktiyon main croson kii sankhya ko soochibaddh karata he, jabaki vyutkram talika uttarotar stambhon main croson kii sankhya ko soochibaddh karti he; vyutkram kramparivartan ke liye lehmar code he or lehmar code ke liye vyutkram kramparivartan
 To effectively convert the Lehmer code dn, dn −1, 


, d 2, d 1 into a permutation of a systematic s set, one can start with a list of elements of s in incremental order and i
 For 1, increase the n listed σ i from the elements listed in which other dn + 1 − i occur first and remove that element from the list
 To convert the inverse table dn, dn −1, 


, d 2, d 1 into a corresponding permutation, insert the number from d 1 to dn from the largest to the smallest elements of s in an initially empty sequence
 Can be reversed; Using the number d from the inverse table in step, the elements of s in the sequence are inserted at the point where the already existing d elements preceded it
 Alternatively, both the insertion table and the elements of s can be processed in reverse order, uttarotar prakritik sankhya ke bhajya sankhya pranali main safal parivartan se ye anukram koshgat kram main utpann hote hai or inhen aage kramparivartan main parivartit karne se mulank kram sangrakshit rahata he basharte ki lehmar code kii vyakhya kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he pratinidhitiv bhajya sankhya pranali main sankhya ke yoga se kramparivartan ke vyutkram kii sankhya praapt hoti he or us yoga kii samta se kramparivartan ke chihnak praapt hote he
 Additionally, the position of zero in the inverse table gives the value of the left-to-right maximum of the permutation while the position of zero in the Lehmer code is the position of the right-to-left shortest; This allows computing the distribution of such lasts in all permutations
 lehmar code ke saath ek kramparivartan d n, d n−1, 


, d 2, d 1 ek arohan hamen − i agar or sirf agaridi ≥ di+1
 Computing may require generating a permutation of a sequence of given values
 yah karne kii sabase upyogi vidhi is baat par nirbhar karti he ki kuch, yadrichhik rup se chune gaye, kramparivartan, yaa sabhi kramparivartan apekshit he or baad ke maamle main yadi ek vishisht kram kii aavashyaktaa he
 Another question is whether the probabilistic similarity between entries in the given sequence is to be taken into account; If this is the case, specific multiset permutations of the sequence must be generated
 n ke kramparivartan ko utpann karne kaa ek spasht tarika he ki lehmar code ke liye mulya utpann kiye jaaen or unhen samroop kramparivartan main parivartit kiya jaae
 haalanki baad kaa charan bhale hi spasht he par kushalta se lagu karnaa kathin he kyonki iske liye ek yadrichhik sthiti par, ek sarini yaa shrankhlabaddh suchi ke rup main anukram ke pratyaksh pratinidhitiv ke anukram main se prayek chayan kii n sankriya or usase vilopan apekshit he; parivartan ke liye donon ke liye lagbhag n 2 / 4 sankriyaayein apekshit hai
 The probability of n being particularly small is not much of a problem, but it turns out that there are simple alternatives available for both random and systematic production that are more efficient
 is kaaran se yah upyogi prathit nahin hota he haalanki nishchit rup se sambhav he, ki aisi vishesh data sanrachana ko niojit kiya jaae jisase o samay main lehmar code kramparivartan main roopantaran kiya ja sake
 To generate a random permutation of a sequence of given n values, it does not matter whether a randomly chosen sequence of n is applied to the sequence or a random element is selected from the specific permutations of the sequence
 This is because, although in the case of recurring values, there may be specific permutations of n that derive the same permutation sequence, the number of such permutations is the same for each possible result
 suvyavasthit utpaadan ke vipareet jo n ! sankhya ke vikaas ke kaaran brihad n ke liye avyaavhaarik ban jaataa he, yah maan liye jane kaa koi kaaran nahin he ki yadrichhik utpaadan ke liye n chota hoga
 The basic idea of generating random permutations is to randomly place an n! The sequence which is of integers d 1, d 2, 


, dn has to produce a satisfactory 0 ≤ di <i and convert it into a permutation by means of bisector analogy

 Computer implementation was not an issue at the time, this method leads to the difficulty depicted above in efficiently switching from Lehmer code to permutations

 Thus the remaining elements for selection form a chronological range at each point in time, even if they are not in the same order as if they were in the original sequence
 purnank ke anukram se kramparivartan kaa pratichitran kuch had tak jatil he, par tatkaal praveshan dwaara ise prayek kramparivartan thik ek tarah se utpann karte dekha ja saktaa he

 To use it, we start sorting the sequence in increasing order and then repeat until the next permutation is found

 The following calculus arithmatically generates the next permutation of the lexical form after a given permutation

 Turning this sequence on in step 4 produces its lexicographic minimum permutation and the lexical successor for the initial state of the entire sequence
