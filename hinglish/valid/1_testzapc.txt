 In Kalidasa's poetry, the flow of the narrative is the dynamic, the simple, but effective expression of the expression of the human mind, the generality of the canvas of history - these poems target their disregard
 chote chote varnya vritton ko lekar mahakavy roodhiyon ke vistrut varnanon or kalatmak, alankarik or shastreey uktiyon evam chamatkaaramayi abhivyaktiyon dwaara kavy kii akaarmurti ko inamen vistaar mila he

 isi se kuch pandit, is harshavardhanottar sanskrit sahitya ko kavyasrjan kii drushti se "hrasonmukhyugin" maanate hai
 But the orthodox practices of orthodox poetry appear with great flourish in these poems

 Then the maturity of the erudition, the brilliance of the expression and the power of expression, have made his poetry poetic

 It is the first and the least in terms of size in the epics of Brihattrayi

 The mention of the inscription "iohal" inscription in 634 AD and the indication of Dandi's "avantisundarikatha" is inferred that "bharavi" was a Paramasiva and Dakshinatya poet

 It has imaginative descriptions of seasons, mountains, rivers, sunrise, sunset, etc
, following the epic trait of Dandi

 Its main organ is "ras" Veer

 even though it is secondary than Kalapaksha

 This poem is definitely of ornate poetry-style
 isamen buddhi or hriday, shringarrasikata or raajnneeti kushalta, varnananapunya or kalatmak chamatkaar ek saath milte hai
 Its poetry is unique in its form
 parantu shishupal vadh main kiratarjuneey kii apeksha sab drushtiyon se utkarsh yoga adhik he
 According to the Sanskrit poet's pacific subhashikoti, in this epic of the Magha poet, the three metaphors of Kalidasa, Bharavi's Artha Gaurava and Dandi's Padalatya are all co-ordinated
 kalidas kaa bhavapravaah, bharavi kaa kalanapunya or bhattikaar ke vyakaranpanditya ke ekatra yoga se uskaa utkarsh bad gaya he
 The use of idiomatic language of Paninian Sanskrit is also superior to Shishupala Slaughter Bhatti Poetry in Neptune

 Padyadi and pictographic vocabulary poetry with monosyllabic duality are also here and political consultancy in the first two cantos
 spasht hi is par bharavikavy kii pratichhaya he
 But in terms of description of ornate-poetic-composition-skill and nature, Shishupalavadha is very excellent as compared to the tenant
 iske varnan paandityapurna, alankrita or roodhisanwalit hone par bhi bade sapraan hai
 They have direct observation of the poet and liveliness of the raga

 But it also has a Mahabharata, the original story short, which has gone from narration to inflation
 atyaachaar or bal se trast trailoky kii dasha naarad se sunakar krishna, balram or uddhav ne mantranaa kii or pandavon ke rajasuya yajna main jane kaa nishchay kiya
 Journey, rest, etc
 from the third canto to the Trayodash canto is a description of the intermittent episodes and viharakelis where there is a complete lack of sustenance of the chronicles
 chaudaaven se lekar biswein sarg tak yudhisthir ke rajasuya yajna tathaa krishna or shishupal ke yuddh evam tatsambaddha avaantar prasangon kaa kalatmak or alankrita varnan he
 This poem is also mainly of Veer Rasa but endowed with oily bananas and lustful sweetness of beauty
 parantu vir ras se samprukt varnan bhi isamen bade jeevant or prabhaavshaalee hai
 The main story is mainly in numerical circles 1, 2, 14 and 20
 paratu shringaari varnanon main - visheshat: vibhavanubhaavon ke ankan main sanshlisht chitra sajiv or gatimay hai
 Their nature description is also cumbersome due to the burden of adornment of unprepared laws
 ve swabhaavokti or praudhokti dwividh nirmaan ke nishnaat shilpi hai
 Overall, Shishupalavadha is the finest poem of its kind, whose impressive poeticity and generosity are unmatched
 alankrita kavyrachana style kii pradhantavaale maghottarayugi kaviyon dwaara nirmit kaavyon main alankaran pradhanta, praudhokti kalpana se prerit varnan pransgon kii sphitata tathaa paandityalabdh gyanagarishthata atisangyojan aadi kii pravriti badi
 The full climax of that interest can be seen in Sriharsha's medical chart

 In the Naishdha, the classical vaishutya and the great flight of imagination, Adyant is seen

 Necessary changes in the original form of the original story have also been done here and there
 aisa maaloom padataa he ki is puranakatha kii lokapriyata ne bade pracheen kaal se hi ise lokkatha bana diya he
 For this reason, the poet also took some elements from there
 yah mahakavy aadyant shringaari he
 Purvarag, Viraha, Swan's cremation, Swayambara, nal-damayanti-vivah, the couple's first encounter and the Ashtayamacharya and the Khandavagic narrative of Sanyogavilas have been greatly magnified by the poet's narrators and imaginative Vaidyavilas
 shringaarparikar ke varnyachitron ne bhi us vistaaran main yoga diya he
 With the help of the flight of his imagination, the same picture by Pandit Kavi has been elaborated in many forms by various new unaided schemes
 lagata he, ek prastut ko ek ke baad ek itar aprastuton dwaara aanklit karne main kavi kii pragna thakti hi nahin
 Nature of nature, pathology, metaphor, metaphor, inspirational exaggeration, contrast, syllogism etc
 The ability to use semantics, alliterative, glossary, empowered use of miraculous miracles, and the amazing ability to use the appropriation of dictionaries, poignant, mature and expedient planning of classical aspects, imaginations and Proper insertion of images, first-mogul This poetry has been getting unprecedented respect in Sanskrit pandimandali till date due to its spontaneous emergence of lustful marking, embellishments and ornamental poetic style of adornment and miracle
 magh kavi se bhi adhik sriharsh ne ise kavyabadhak paandityapradarshan ke yoga se bahut badha diya he jisase laghukthanakwala kavy ati vrihat ho gaya he
 Being insensitive in marking the skills of Shringari villas and chiefly Kailas and the luxuries of Rasik Nagars, the poet's philosophical generosity increased poetic place in poetry
 punarukti, chyutsamskruti aadi anek dosha bhi yatra tatra dhunde ja sakate hai
 But even after his stay, the artist's amazing talent has shone in the epic due to his grandeur and sublime, imaginativeness and generosity, pedagogy and euphoria, even when ornamented, there is a spontaneous luxury in his play
 usamen praudh shastreeyta or kalpanamanohar bhavyata he
 The study of the three epics of Brihattrayi is still considered essential for the Pandits

NET Framework, with both native code and managed code to develop Windows Forms applications, web sites, web applications and web services as well as console and graphical user interface applications
 NET Compact Framework and can be done for all platforms supported by Microsoft Silverlight
 vijual studio main ek code sampadak shaamil hota he, jo intelicense or saath hi code reffactoring kaa samarthan karata he
 This integrated debugger acts as both a source-level debugger and a machine-level debugger
 anya antarnirmit upkarnon main GUI anuprayogon ke nirmaan ke liye form diziner, web diziner, class diziner or database skima diziner shaamil hai
 It accepts plug-ins, which can be used at almost every level, from adding support for source control mechanisms, to adding new tools-groups such as editors and visual designers for domain-specific languages, or other aspects of the software development life cycle
 Increase in functionality
 bhashaa sevaaon ke madhyam se vijual studio bhashaaon kaa samarthan karata he, ek bhashaa-aadhaarit seva uplabdh hone par code sampadak or dibgar ko lagbhag kisi bhi programing bhashaa kaa samarthan karne kii anumati detii hai
 Built-in languages include c / c ++, VB
NET and c # 
 anya bhashaaon, jaise f # , M, paythan or rubi aadi, ke liye samarthan pruthak rup se sthapit kii jane vaali bhashaa sevaaon ke madhyam se uplabdh he
 It also supports XML / XSLT, HTML / XHTML, javascript and CSS
 vijual studio ke bhashaa-aadhaarit sanskaran bhi uplabdh hai, jo prayoktaaon ko adhik simit bhashaa sevaayen pradaan karte hai
 These independent packages are called Microsoft Visual Basic, Visual j # , Visual c # and Visual c ++
 microsoft apane vijual studio 2008 ke vijual basic, vijual c # , vijual C++ or vijual web develper ghatakon ke "express" sanskaran bina kisi laagat ke pradaan karata he
 The language-based versions of Visual Studio 2005 as well as the Visual Studio 2008 and 2005 Professional editions are available as a free download for students through the Microsoft Dreamspark program
 vijual studio 2010 abhi release ummidavaar he or ise aam logon dwaara muft main downlod kiya ja saktaa he
 Finally, Visual Studio does not support any programming language, solution or tool
 isaki bajaay, yah vibhinn kaaryaatmakataa ko jodne kii anumati detaa he
 Specific functionality is coded as a vspackage
 sthapit ho jane par, yah kaaryaatmakataa ek seva ke rup main uplabdh hoti he
 The IDE provides three services: svssolution, which provides the ability to calculate projects and solutions; svsuishell, which provides windowing and UI functionality; And svsshell, which handles vspackage registration
 iske atirikt, IDE sevaaon ke bich samvaad kaa talmail karne or ise sakasham banane ke liye bhi uttaradaayi hota he
 All editors, designers, project types and other tools are implemented as vspackages
 vspackages ke abhigaman ke liye vijual studio COM kaa prayog karata he
 Visual Studio's SDK also includes a Managed Package Framework, a set of managed wrappers around com-interfaces that allows packages to be written in any CLI compliant language
 haalanki, MPF vijual studio COM interphes dwaara ujagar kii jane vaali sari kaaryaatmakataa pradaan nahin karata
 iske baad sevaaon kaa prayog vijual studio IDE main kaaryaatmakataa jodanevaale anya packejon main se kisi ke bhi nirmaan ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Support for programming languages is added using a specific vspackage called Language Service
 ek bhashaa seva vibhinn interphes paribhaashit karti he, jise vspackage kriyanvayan vividh kaaryaatmakataa ke liye samarthan jodne hetu kriyanvit kar saktaa he
 Functionalities thus added include syntax coloring, statement execution, brace matching, parameter information tooltip, member lists, and error markers for background compilation
 yadi yah interphes kriyanvit kiya jaataa he, to kaaryaatmakataa us bhashaa ke liye uplabdh hogi
 Language services are to be implemented on a per-language basis
 yah kriyanvayan us bhashaa ke liye parcer yaa compiler se code kaa punarprayog kar saktaa he
 Language services can be implemented in native code or managed code
 mul code ke liye mul COM interphes yaa babel fremawork kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 MPF for managed code includes wrappers for writing managed language services
 strot niyantran ke liye vijual studio main koi antarnirmit samarthan shaamil nahin hota, lekin vah is aadhaar par MSSCCI ko paribhaashit karata he ki koun-sa strot niyantran tantra IDE ke saath ekikrut ho saktaa he
 MSSCCI defines a set of functions, which are used to implement various source control functionalities
 MSSCCI ko pehali baar vijual sorsef ko vijual studio 6
0 ke saath ekikrut karne ke liye prayog kiya gaya tha, lekin baad main ise vijual studio SDK ke madhyam se shuru kiya gaya
 Visual Studio 
NET 2002 used MSSCCI 1
1 and Visual Studio 
NET 2003 used MSSCCI 1
2
 vijual studio 2005 or 2008 donon MSSCCI sanskaran 1
3 kaa prayog karte hai, jo punahnamakaran or vilop sancharan ke saath hi atulykaalik prarambhikaran ke liye samarthan bhi jodta he
 Visual Studio supports implementing multiple instances of the environment
 ye instons vibhinn registry hikes kaa prayog unki vinyas avasthaaon ke bhandaran ke liye karte hai or unhen unke appid dwaara pahachaanaa jaataa he
 These instances are initiated by an appid-specific 
exe, which selects an appid, sets the root hive, and initializes the IDE
 ek appid ke liye panjikrut kiye gayi vspackages ko us appid ke liye anya vspackages ke saath ekikrut kiya jaataa he
 Visual Studio Express product versions of Visual Studio are created using various appids
 vijual studio express sanskaran utpaada apane swayan ke appid ke saath install kiye jate hai, lekin standard, profeshnal or team sweet utpaada ek hi appid ko saajha karte hai
 As a result, the Express version can be installed in parallel with other versions, unlike other versions that update the previous installation itself
 profeshnal sanskaran main standard sanskaran ke vspackages kaa ek mukhya-samucchy or team sweet main anya donon sanskarnon ke vspackages kaa mukhya-samucchy shaamil hota he
 The appid mechanism leverages Visual Studio Shell in Visual Studio 2008
 kisi bhi anya ] kii tarah vijual studio main bhi ek code sampadak shaamil hota he, jisamen intelicense kaa prayog karke na keval veriables, functions or methds ke liye, balki bhashaa ke nirmaan khandon, jaise lups or queries, ke liye bhi cintax hiliting or code purnataa ke liye samarthan shaamil hota he
 intellisense support is also provided for the languages included, as well as for XML and for cascading style sheets and javascript when developing web sites and web applications
 autokampulit suzav ek modvihin list box main pop-ap hote hai, jo ki code editor ke sheersh par achchhadit hota he
 In Visual Studio 2008 and later it can be temporarily made semi-transparent, so that the code that is interrupted by it can be seen
 code sampadak kaa prayog sabhi samarthit bhashaaon ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Visual Studio Code Editor also supports setting bookmark rites in code for quick operation
 anya sanchaalanaatmak sahaaytaaon main saamaanya text khoj or regex khoj ke saath hi code blox or vriddhishil khoj shaamil hote hai
 The code editor also includes a multi-object clipboard and a task list
 code sampadak code-khandon kaa bhi samarthan karata he, jo doharaavpurn code ke liye sanchit template hote hai or jis pariyojna par kaary kiya ja rahaa ho, usamen inhen pravisht or customise kiya ja saktaa he
 a management tool for code blocks is also built-in
 ye upkaran tairti hui vindos ke rup main pradarshit hote hai, jinhen prayog na kiye jane yaa screen ke baaju main rakh diye jane par swachaalit rup se chhip jane hetu set kiya ja saktaa he
 Visual Studio's code editor also supports parameter recording, variable and method renaming, interface quotation and other code refactoring, including encapsulation of class members within properties
 vijual studio becoground compylation kaa samarthan karata he
 When the code is being written, Visual Studio compiles it in the background to provide feedback about syntax and compilation errors, which are marked by a red wavy underline
 chetavaniyon ko ek hari adhorekha ke dwaara chihnit kiya jaataa he
 Background compilation does not generate executable code because it requires a different compiler than the compiler used for executable code
 becoground compylation sabase pehle microsoft vijual basic main prastut kiya gaya tha, lekin ab ise sabhi sammilit bhashaaon ke liye vistaarit kiya ja chukaa he
 Visual Studio includes a debugger, which can act as both a source-level debugger and a machine-level debugger
 yah prabandhit code or mul code donon ke saath kaary karata he or iskaa prayog vijual studio dwaara samarthit kisi bhi bhashaa main likhe anuprayogon kii dibging ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Additionally, it can be combined with the processes currently being implemented, so that they can be inspected and debugged
 yadi kriyanvit ho rahi prakriya ke liye strot code uplabdh ho, to kriyanvayan ke saath hi yah code ko pradarshit karata he
 If the source code is not available, it may display disassemblies
 vijual studio dibgar anek memory damp bana saktaa he or saath hi unhen baad main dibging ke liye lod bhi kar saktaa he
 Multithreaded programs are also supported
 dibgar ko vijual studio ke baahar kriyanvit ho rahe kisi anuprayog ke vifal hone par prarambh kiye jane ke liye bhi vinyasit kiya ja saktaa he
 The debugger also allows setting breakpoints and watches
 brakepoints shart par aadhaarit ho sakate hai, jiskaa arth he ki ve us samay prarambh hote hai, jab koi shart purna hoti he
 The code can be proceeded sequentially, ie one line at a time
 yah functions ko dibag karne ke liye inke bheetar pravisht ho saktaa he yaa yadi maanviya nirikshan ke liye function body uplabdh na ho, to vah ise chhodkar aage bhi bad saktaa he
 The debugger supports edit and continue, that is, it also supports editing the code as soon as it is debugged
 dibging karte samay, yadi kisi bhi veriable par mouse suchak le jaaya jaae, to iskaa vartmaan maan ek tultip main pradarshit hota he, jahaan ise icchaanusaar sanshodhit bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 During coding, the Visual Studio Debugger allows specific functionalities to be started manually from the intermediate tool windows
 methd ke liye parameter emidiat vindo par bheje jate hai
 Visual Studio includes a visual designer to assist in the development of applications
 in upkarnon main shaamil hai: Visual Studio allows developers to write extensions for Visual Studio to enhance its capabilities
 ye vistaaran vijual basic main "plag-in" ho jate hai or isaki kaaryaatmakataa ko badhaate hai
 Extensions come in the form of macros, add-ins and packages
 macrose doharaavpurn kaaryon or gatividhiyon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, jinhen vikasakarta bhandaran, punarprayog or vitaran ke liye programetic rup se record kar saktaa he
 However, macros cannot be used to execute new commands or to create tool windows
 They are written using Visual Basic and are not compiled
 Add-ins provide access to the Visual Studio object model and can interact with IDE tools
 aid-ins kaa prayog nai kaaryaatmakataa jodne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he or ye nai tul vindo jod sakate hai
 Add-ins are added to the IDE via COM and can be created in any com-compatible language
 package vijual studio SDK kaa prayog karke banaae jate hai or ve vitanyata kaa ucchtam str pradaan karte hai
 It is used to build designers and other tools as well as to integrate other programming languages
 vijual studio SDK kisi kaary ko purna karne ke liye aprabandhit or prabandhit donon API pradaan karata he
 However, managed apis are not as widespread as unmanaged apis
 vistaaranon kaa samarthan vijual studio 2005 ke standard sanskarnon main kiya jaataa he
 Express editions do not support hosting extensions
 vijual studio 2008 ne vijual studio shell prastut kiya, jo IDE ko apni ruchi ke anusaar nirmit karne kii anumati detaa he
 The Visual Studio shell provides a shell of vspackages, which provides the functionality required for any IDE
 instolation ko apni ruchi ke anusaar parivartit karne ke liye uske sheersh par anya package jode ja sakate hai
 The isolated mode of the shell creates a new appid where the packages are installed
 inhen ek bhinn akxcuteble ke saath prarambh karnaa hota he
 It aims at the development of development environments developed according to the interest for a specific language or specific scenario
 ekikrut mod package ko profeshnal / standard / team system sanskarnon main install karata he, taaki upkarnon ko in sanskarnon main ekikrut kiya ja sake
 Visual Studio Shell is available as a free download
 vijual studio 2008 kii release ke baad, microsoft ne vijual studio gailaree kaa nirmaan kiya
 It serves as a central location for Visual Studio to provide information about extensions
 samudaay vikasakarta or saath hi vanijyik vikasakarta vijual studio 2002 se lekar vijual studio 2008 tak ke unke vistaaranon ke bare main soochna aplod kar sakate hai
 To help in evaluating the quality of extensions while they are added, users of the site can rate extensions and review them
 RSS feeds prayoktaaon ko site par hone vaale adyatanon kii soochna dete hai or tanging visheshtaayen bhi niojit hoti hai
 Microsoft Visual Studio is available in the following versions: saanchaa:citecheckmaikrosoypta ne pehali baar apane anek programing upkarnon ko ek saath jodakar vijual studio ko sabase pehle 1997 main release kiya
 Visual Studio 97 was released in two versions, Professional and Enterprise
 isamen vijual basic 5
0 or vijual C++ 5
0, mukhyatah vindos programing ke liye; vijual J++ 1
1, java tathaa vindos programing ke liye; or vijual foxpro 5
0, database ke liye, vishisht rup se xbase programing ke liye, ko shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Visual Interdev was introduced to create dynamically generated web sites using Active Server Pages
 isamen microsoft develper network librari kaa ek snapashot bhi shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Visual Studio 97 was Microsoft's first attempt to use the same development environment for multiple languages
 vijual C++, vijual J++, interdev or MSDN librari, sabhi ek hi vaataavaran kaa prayog karte the, jise develper studio kaha jaataa tha
 Different environments were used for Visual Basic and Visual foxpro
 aglaa sanskaran, sanskaran 6
0, june 1998 main release kiya gaya or yah vindos 9x placeform par kriyanvit hone vaala antim sanskaran he
 The version numbers of all its component parts were reduced to 6
0, including Visual j ++, which was replaced by 1
1, and Visual interdev, which was at 1
0
 yah sanskaran agle chaar varshon tak microsoft ke vikaas tantra kaa aadhaar tha, kyonki uske baad microsoft ne unka vikaas 
NET par kendrit kar diya
 Visual Studio 6
0 was the last version to include a com-based version of Visual Basic; Later versions were to include 
NET based versions of this language
 yah vijual J++ ko shaamil karne vaala antim sanskaran bhi tha, jise san microsystems ke saath ek samjhaute ke baad hataa diya gaya, jiske kaaran microsoft ko java virtual mashin par lakshyit programing upkarnon kaa utpaadan roak dena padaa
 Visual Basic, Visual c ++ and Visual foxpro had separate ides, while Visual j ++ and Visual Intrade shared a common new environment
 yah nayaa IDE vitanyata kaa dhyaan rakhte hue banaaya gaya tha or vijual studio 
NET kii release ke saath hi yah sabhi bhashaaon ke liye ek aam vaataavaran bananevaala tha
 Visual Studio 6
0 was also the final version to include Visual foxpro
 hameshaa kii tarah, vijual basic 6
0 ko anek sanskarnon main prastut kiya gaya: standard, profeshnal or enterprize
 enterprize sanskaran main kuch atirikt visheshtaayen shaamil hai, jo standard yaa profeshnal sanskaran main nahin pain jaatin, jinamein shaamil hai: Microsoft released Visual Studio 
NET, codenamed Rainier, in February 2002
 The biggest change was the presentation of a managed code development environment using 
NET
 
NET kaa prayog karke viksit kiye gayi programs ko masini bhashaa main nahin, balki microsoft intermediat language yaa kaaman intermediat language main compyle kiya jaataa he
 When an MSIL application is implemented, it is compiled in the appropriate machine language only during implementation, according to the platform on which it is being implemented, making the code portable between different platforms
 MSIL main compyle kiye gayi programs ko keval un plateformon par kriyanvit kiya ja saktaa he, jin par kaaman language infrastracchar ko lagu kiya gaya ho
 It is possible to run MSIL programs on Linux or Mac OS x using non-microsoft 
NET implementations, such as Mono and dotgnu
 yah vijual studio kaa pehla sanskaran tha, jisamen nt-aadhaarit vindos placeform kii aavashyaktaa thi
 The installer promotes this requirement
 vijual studio 
NET chaar sanskarnon main prastut kiya gaya: ekadmik, profeshnal, enterprize develper or enterprize architect
 microsoft ne c # , ek nai bhashaa, jo 
NET par lakshyit he, prastut kii
 It also introduced a successor to Visual j ++, called Visual j # 
 vijual j # programs java ke bhashaa niyamon kaa prayog karte hai
 However, unlike Visual j ++ programs, Visual j # programs can only target the 
NET Framework, not the Java virtual machine to which all other Java tools target
 vijual basic ko puri tarah parivartit kiya gaya tha, taaki ise is naye fremawork main samahit kiya ja sake or is naye sanskaran ko vijual basic 
NET naam diya gaya
 Microsoft also added extensions to c ++, called Managed Extensions for c ++, so that c ++ programmers could build 
NET programs
 vijual studio 
NET kaa prayog vindos web or, ek aid-in ke saath, suvahya upkarnon par lakshyit anuprayogon ke nirmaan ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 The Visual Studio 
NET environment was partially rewritten to use 
NET
 sabhi bhashaaon ko ek hi vaataavaran ke antargat ekikrut kiya gaya tha
 Compared to previous versions of Visual Studio, it has a more pronounced interface and higher compatibility
 upkaran vindos, jo prayog na kiye jane par swachaalit rup se chhip jaati hai, ke saath ise apni ruchi ke anusaar parivartit kar paanaa adhik sambhav he
 Although Visual foxpro 7 was launched as a part of Visual Studio 7, and early VS beta versions allowed debugging within vfp-based dlls, it had to follow its own development path before release
 is removed
