 praarambhik bijganit main dhan or rin chihnon se sambanddh kai padon ke vyanjak ko bahupad kehete hai, yatha 
 Its specific surnames are 'ekapada', 'dwipad', etc
 according to the number of posts
 ucchtar ganit main bahupad kaa vishisht upyog aise vyanjak ke liye hota he jiske padon main kisi ek char raashi, yaa ek se adhik char raashiyon, ke shunya athwa dhan purnank ghaat aaroh yaa avaroh kram main ho, yatha Is a polynomial of expression and x, yz, and is constant
 yadi ke sthaan main sarvatra koi anya vyanjak maan len, log x rakh diya jaae, to nayaa vyanjak log x kaa vyanjak kehalaayegaa
 Among the powers of terms, the greatest is called the power of the polynomial
 yadi ek se adhik char rashiyaan hon, to vibhinn padon main char raashiyon ke ghaaton ke yogafalon main se mahattam ko bahupad kaa ghaat kehete hai
 Thus, the power of a polynomial is 4 and 7
 aisa bhi kaha jaataa he ki bahupad main chathe ghaat kaa or main dwitiya ghaat kaa he
 The sum, difference, and product of two polynomials are polynomials, but their quotient is not a polynomial
 do bahupadon ke bhagfal ko, jinamein ek sankhya maatr bhi ho saktaa he, parimey falan kehete hai
 The comprehensive polynomial of power in the variable is: bijganit kaa ek moulik prameya yah he ki yadi f char raashi x main ghaat m kaa bahupad he, to bahupad sameekaran f = 0 ke sadaa m mul hote hai
 These can also be basic composite and concurrent
 yadi f = 0 kaa koi mul p1 he to bahupad f main kaa bhaag puraa-puraa chalaa jaataa he or bhagfal main ghaat m-1 vaala ek bahupad f1 praapt hota he
 Now the polynomial equation f1 = 0 will have m-1 root and if it has a root, then the part in f1 will be completely gone
 yah ek mahatvapurn prameya he ki f kaa gunankhandan adwitiya hota he
 If we restrict the numbers used in the coefficients and factors of f to the fact that they belong to a certain area, then the roots do not exist
 itnaa avashya he ki yadi bahupad kaa gunankhandan ho sakegaa, to gunankhand adwitiya honge
 An important theorem of trigonometry is that if m is a positive integer, then the expression of cosine mx can be expressed as a polynomial with m power of cosine x, as jya mx ke bare main prameya yah he ki yadi m visham he to jya mx kii abhivyakti jya x ke m wein ghaat ke bahupad ke rup main kii ja sakati he or yadi m sam he to jya mx / kojya x kii abhivyakti jya x ke m-1 wein ghaat ke bahupad ke rup main hogi, yatha Curves in analytical geometry are studied by representing them by polynomial equations of two variables

 Curves and planets represented by polynomial equations of arbitrary power are studied in algebraic geometry
 do yaa adhik charon ke aise bahupad ko, jiske prayek pad main charon ke ghaaton kaa yogafal samaan ho, samghaat bahupad, yaa keval samghaat, kehete hai; aadhunik bijganit main in samghaaton ke roopantaran kaa or in roopatanranon se sambandhit nishchar or sahaparivart ke siddhaton kaa pramukh sthaan he or inke anek upyog hai
 a variable polynomial in calculus is the function of simple squares, because their rules of differential and integral are particularly simple and in every case the fruit is a polynomial
 aadhunik falan siddhant main prayek bahupad apane charon kaa ek satat or vaishleshik falan hota he
 An important theorem in this theory is that if a function of a composite variable is analytic for each finite value of the variable, it will be a polynomial and if the function remains finite even if the variable is infinite, it is only a constant
 
 bahupadon kaa upyog sanniktan ke liye bhi hota he
 The standard function of elementary analysis, according to the mclaurin or Taylor theorem, can be represented by the power series
 karl vystrasi ne 1885 i

 In addition to Y, Y2, xxrep 4 
 to express a function, there are other polynomial communities
 udhaahrant:, lajandr bahupad 
 These polynomials are used plurally in applied mathematics

 The features of these languages are that all ancient indo-european languages had many word-forms of noun, pronoun, adjective and verb, which showed their grammatical form in a sentence
 adhiktar ye shabd-rup shabd ke ant main pratyay dwaara banaaye jaati the 
 The words used for everyday things, relatives, common animals, verbs were very similar to each other in all the ancient languages of this family and on this basis linguists envisaged the primitive-indo-european language

 ye naam europea logon ko bahut pasand aayaa or jald hi sabhi europea vaasiyon ne apane apane deshon ko pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bataanaa shuru kar diya 
 Especially Hittler propagated that Germany is the birthplace of ancient Aryans and Arya means pure generation, whose skin is fair, long, eyes blue and hair golden
 hitlar ke anusaar german log hi sarvocch or sarvashaktimaan nasl ke hai or vishesh taur par yahudee log ghatiya nasl ke or anarya hai 
 The British publicized that around 1700 BC
 In the indo-aryan tribes, coming from Europe, invaded the Indus Valley and devastated the indigenous Indus Valley civilization of India and massacred its inhabitants and later made the remaining people slaves - who were enslaved and bandit in the Rigveda
 Having said 
 hitlar ke yahudee narsanhaar ke baad ab "arya" shabd kaa matlab bhashaai arth main lagaaya jaataa he, na ki nasl ke liye
 But historians and linguists are still searching for the birthplace of the Aryans

 Lycopene absorbs all but the longest wavelength of visible light, so it appears red
 paudhon or prakaash sanshleshak jeevanu swaabhaavik rup se ol-trns licopen kaa utpaadan karte hai, lekin shuddh rup se anu ke kul 72 jyamitiya vilgan sambhav ho rahe hai
 By contact with heat or light, lycopene can go through the process of separation of any number of these sis -isomers, which may have a twist rather than a straight shape
 apni aanvik urja kii vajah se vibhinn vilgak alag-alag sthirataa darshaate hai 
 maanav rakt dhara main, kul licopen saghanta kaa 60 % se adhik vibhinn sis -isomar kaa he, lekin alag-alag isomaron ke jaivik prabhaav kii jaanch nahin kii gayi he

 eucarotic paudhon or prokeriotic cynobacteria main licopen kaa jaiviksanshleshan, sammilit anzimon kii tarah samanurup he
 Synthesis begins with mevalonic acid, which is converted into dimethylalyl pyrophosphate
 iske baad yah bees carbon jeranilgeranile pyrophosphate dene ke liye isopantenoil pyrophosphate ke teen anuon sahit saghan ho jaataa he
 The two molecules of this product then condense into a tail-to-tail configuration to give forty carbon phytons, the first step towards carotenoid biosynthesis
 disacuration ke kai charnon ke madhyam se fiton licopen main badal jaataa he
 Two groups of terminal isoprenes can be cyclized to produce beta carotene, after which it can be transformed into a wide variety of xanthophils
 jin fal or subjiyon main licopen adhik hota hai unamem gaak, tamaato, tarbooz,gulabi angoor, gulabi amaruud, papeeta, laal gol mirch, sebuckthron, vulfberi or gulab kaa fal shaamil hai haalanki gaak main licopen kii maatra kisi bhi gyaat fal yaa sabji se adhik he, udahaaran ke liye, tamaato se 70 guna adhik he
 But due to its rare origin of gak outside of Southeast Asia, most people consume more than 85% of tomatoes and tomato-based sauces, juices and ketchup as the main source of diet for lycopene
 tamaato main licopen kii maatra isaki prajatiyon par nirbhar karti he or fal ke pakane ke saath-saath bad jaati he
 In contrast to other fruits and vegetables, the nutritional content of vitamin c is reduced during cooking, making tomatoes more dense in bioavailable lycopene
 taaja tamaato kii tulana main tamaato ke paste main licopen chaar guna adhik baykevelable he
 Hence tomato sauce is a preferred source compared to raw tomatoes
 jahaan adhikansh hari patteydaar subjiyon or licopen ke anya sroton main tel or vasa kam hoti he, vahin licopen pani main aghulansheel he or sabji ke reshe se kasakar judaa rahata he
 Tomato-based sources contain tomato-processed products such as preserved tomato juice, soups, sauces, and ketchup with the highest bioavailable lycopene concentrations
 pakaane or tamaato ko kuchalane kii prakriya tathaa adhik tel vaale vyanjan main inkaa seven pachan tantra se khun main jaakar iske samavesh ko badhaate hai
 Lycopene is fat soluble so it is considered helpful in the absorption of oil
 licopen kii ucch sandratha or santrupt or asantrupt vasiy amla yuktagak ek ullekhneey apwaad he
 Lycopene can be obtained from vegetables and fruits such as tomatoes, but the fungus Blackslea trispora is another source of lycopene
 licopen ke shuddhikaran or nishkarshan ke prayojan se gaak ek aashajanak vanijyik strot he
 Sis-lycopene is more bioavailable in some varieties of tomatoes
 antargrahan ke baad, licopen choti aant main vasa missells main shaamil ho jaati he
 These micelles are made up of dietary fat and bile acids and are helpful in the dissolution of hydrophobic lycopene and allow it to spread to the cells of the mucous membrane of the intestine by a passive transport system
 licopen kii yakrut chayapachay kriya ke bare main bahut kam jaankaree he lekin anya carotenoid kii tarah licopen bhi kylomicrons main nigamit hota he or lymphatic system main vimukt kiya jaataa he
 Lycopene eventually is distributed in very low and low density lipoprotein fractions in blood plasma
 licopine mukhya rup se adhivrikk grathiyon, yakrut or viryakosh jaise angon tathaa vasa utakon main vitarit hota he
 Lycopene is not toxic and is commonly found in the diet, but cases of excessive carotenoid intake have also been reported
 ek praudh mahila, jo lambe samay tak tamaato ke ras kaa atyadhik seven karti rahi, uski twachaa or yakrut naarangi pile rang ke ho gaye the tathaa uske khun main licopen kaa str bhi kaaphi ooncha paaya gaya
 Her skin returned to a normal color after consuming a lycopene-free diet for three weeks

 Lycopene is the most potent carotenoid in singlet oxygen destroyer, which was found to be 100 times more efficient than vitamin e in a study of test tubes of singlet oxygen exterminator, which is 125 times more efficient than glutethene
 parabangnee prakaash ke sampark main aane se utpann singlate-oxigen twachaa kii umr ke badhane kaa praathmik kaaran he
 Substantial scientific and clinical research has been devoted to a possible correlation between lycopene intake and general health, given its antitussive properties
 praarambhik anusandhan ne hriday rog, cancer, madhumeh, osteoporosis or yahaan tak ki purush banjhapan main kuch sudhaar ke sanket die hai
 Several studies have been conducted to analyze the anti-cancer content of lycopene, although preliminary research has been inconclusive
 fefde, pet or prostate granthi ke cancer ke liye licopen ke laabh ke shashakt pramaan mili hai
 Lycopene is not modified in the body by vitamin A, so it can be accessed for other benefits such as oxidation resistance
 licopen ke liye beta-yonon ring sanrachana kaa abhaav isaki oxikaarkavirohi kriya ko badhaata he
 Lycopene is the most efficient oxygen and free radicals and also the major carotenoid in plasma and other tissues
 licopen fefdon ke utakon main bhi paaya jaataa he or fefdon ke cancer main pai janevaali NO2 kshati se limposites kii raksha karne main moolyawaan he
 Lycopene may also help reduce the effects of oxidative load produced by an abdominal pylori infection
 tamaato se vyutpann carotenoid licopen phej II vishanirodhak anzime jaise sharir or koshikaon se hanikaarak carcinogens ko dur karanevaale cancer nirodhak vishesh anzimon ko sakriy kar cancer ke khatre ko kam kar saktaa he
 In a study of lycopene as an inhibitor of human cancer cell proliferation, it was found that in contrast to cancer cells, human fibroblasts were less sensitive to lycopene, and the cells proved to be slowly inhibiting growth over time
 In addition to its inhibitory effect on endometrial cancer cell proliferation, lycopene insulin's growth factor factor-
 jaise uttejk vikaas ko dabaane main bhi sahaayak paaya gaya
 Insulin-like growth factors are the major autocrine / paracrine regulators of breast and endometrial cancer cell development
 isliye is autocrine / paracrine pranali main licopine kaa hastkshep endometrial cancer or anya tumoron ke niyaman main licopen kii bhoomika par shodh ke nae raste khol saktaa he
 However, various studies have found inhibitory effects on the development of cataracts in lycopene and many different types of cancer cells, including breast and endometrial cancer cells, prostate carcinoma cells, colon cancer cells
 vyapak samiksha ke baad november 2005 main soochna di gayi ki sanyukt rajya america ke khaadya evam aushadhi prashasan ne licopen or prostate cancer kii rokthaam ke bich koi sambandh na dikhaai dene kii vajah se rog ke khatre ko kam karne kii sambhaavna par shaq prakat kiya he, haalanki yah sujhaayaa gaya he ki puraa tamaato khaane se laabh mil saktaa he, kyonki shaayad abhi tak agyaat yogic phydemand agent he
 The FDA review allows a very limited qualification claim to be used as a guide for lycopene-containing tomatoes and tomato products to not mislead consumers, which is as follows: bahut simit or praarambhik vaigyanik shodh se pataa chalata he ki ek saptaah main aadhe se ek cap tamaato evam / yaa tamaato sos khaanaa prostate cancer ke jokhim ko kam kar saktaa he
 The FDA has concluded that there is little scientific evidence to support this claim

 The purana-katha-shastra can be considered the simplest medium through which the early man manifested his religious views
 vaidic dharm ko prakrutiparak kaha gaya he, kyonki, duusare shabdon main, is dharm main mukhya rup se prakritik shaktiyon evam ghatnaon kii puja kii jaati thi, haalaanki yah purnat: sahi nahin he
 Vedic religion and consequently Vedic mythology are in a developmental tradition and can only be studied by relating them to the cultural history of Vedic people
 apane saanskrithik itihaasaanukram se sambandhit karke hi kiya ja saktaa he
 In the early period of his cultural life, the Vedic Aryans, or their ancestors, were increasingly close to him as part of nature
 is kaal main ve prakruti kii vishalata evam samruddhi tathaa chamatkaar se purnat: abhibhoot the
 In this simple sentiment he sought to imbue the religious sentiment which resulted in the spirit of the divine form "divyaparthivi" of the divine parents
 un logon ne yah bhi anubhav kiya ki prakruti yadhyapi vishaal he, tathaapi aniojit evam aniyamit nahin
 It is governed by certain laws
 yah vishrunkhal nahin balki vyavasthit he
 From this knowledge the mythological forms of Rit and Varuna emerged
 varun asur the arthath unke paas asu naamak chamatkaarik shakti thi or apni maaya se usne is sansar ko band rakhaa tha evam iske chote bade vibhinn prakaar ke kaaryon ke niamak the
 He thus attained the rank of emperor
 divine achaarshastra kii is puranic jatilta main mitra, aditi evam aditya bhi the
 Along with this divine mythology, there was the luxury of the divinity of fire, which was the sole basis of Vedic religious work
 saath hi saath yagyeey peya som ke devatv kaa bhi vikaas hua
 Agni, which was the most visible among the individual gods, was also considered to be the center of the household life of the Aryans and to establish a relationship between humans and gods
 saamaanya siddhant ke rup main yah sweekrut kiya ja saktaa he ki kinhin vishesh logon ke dharm evam puraana-katha-shaastra kii prakruti is baat par nirbhar karti he ki ve kis prakaar kaa jivan vyateet karte hai
 The universal religion of Varuna and the Yagya religion of Agni and Soma fulfilled the need of the ancestors of the Aryans when they spent their lives with nature and followed the initial type of Yajniyya
 kintu valkh se aage saptsindhu main aane par in logon ko anek pratidwandvi jatiyon se bhidana padaa
 Hence his religious instinct gave birth to a new deity that could boost his war courage
 uskaa naam yudhdevataa indra tha
 The developing tendency of Vedic purana-katha-shastra is evident in the development of Indra's personality
 mulat: indra ek manavnayak tha jo som se uttejit hokar vaidic aaryon kaa netritv karte hue saptsindhu pahunchaa
 History gradually changed into purana-katha-shastra and Manavanayak became a national war god
 is prakaar ke puranikeekaran main baad main indra par anya kai visheshtaon kaa aropan kiya gaya
 Indra was believed to be the god of rain, who freed the water of heaven by hitting the Meghasura vritra with his barge
 pracheen kathaon ke ahisanhaarak vir se bhi uskaa tadatmya kiya gaya
 Since a large part of the Rig Veda is related to the time of conquest and colonization, it was only natural that the Vedic mythology was overwhelmed by the stories of Indra
 maruton, ashwinon evam rituon ke puranic roopon main anumaanath: aitihaasik ghatnaon ke puranikeekaran hi kaaran hai
 One important thing in the development of the Vedic purana-katha-shastra is that of "saurikaran", that is, the mythological persons belonging to the Solar Gods who were not originally related to the Solar Gods at all
 vaidic puraana-katha-shaastra kaa pramukh saura devtaa surya tha
 But due to many reasons, solar qualities were also included in other gods, such as Vishnu, Pushan and Mitra and Savita
 is sambandh main is baat kaa sanket kiya ja saktaa he ki paurohityapurna dharm main vishnu evam pushan jaise devataaon ko unchaa sthaan dane kaa ek saadhan tha unako jaan boojhkar, yadhyapi banaavati rup se, indra yaa agni athwa som se sabandhit karnaa
 In this context, it is mentioned that Usha is like the sun in the form of a nature goddess, absolutely transparent, though Vedic poets have vivid descriptions of her human beauty
 bharat main prak vaidic anaryon ke dharm ke prabhavaswaroop vaidic arya dharm main rudra ke puranic rup kaa udbhavan hua
 This deity can be considered as the Aryanized form of the original Indian Shiva
 kintu jab shiv ko vaidic dharm main rudra ke rup main apana liya gaya to uske puure vyaktitv ke keval ek bhaag, mrityu ev sanhaar ke devtaa ke rup ko hi mahatv diya gaya
 On the other hand Yama was the father of mankind and for the protection of Manav caste, Yama was also the first person to be killed by Swayam
 tadnantar vah maanav jati kii un sabhi pidiyon arthath pitaron kaa swami hua jo uske baad mrityu ko praapt hui
 Incidentally, it can also be indicated that the description of heaven is also found in the accounts of Yama's empire, but in the early Vedic mythology, the knowledge of hell was not known
 isi prakaar praarambhik vaidic puraana-katha-shaastra main gandharva evam apsaraayen utani mahatvapurn nahin he, haalaanki rugveda ke ek mantra main urvashi or pururava kii puranic katha kaa zikr he
 Among the minor deities, the lord of the sutras, "brahmanaspati" has special significance
 is sambandh main manu, bhrigu evam angiras jaise puranic rishiyon kaa ullekh kiya ja saktaa he
 There is hardly any sign of ghost-worship in Vedic mythology, but divine and semi-divine qualities have been attributed to some animals and roots
 vaidic puraana-katha-shaastra ke vishay main bataate hue brahmanon main ullikhit anek puranic kathaon kaa ullekh bhi kiya janaa chahie, jaise manu evam pralay, shun shape or varun, yadhyapi inamen kai baaten kinhin duusari baton ke gairvabardhan yaa yajna se sambandhit hai
 Two highly popular mythological meanings among Brahmins are that of Prajapati's Tapas and Devasurasangram
 upanishdon ke anek darshanik upadesh bhi indra, virochan evam uma haimavati kii puranic kathaon ke madhyam se bataae gaye hai

 is kaaran assam ke liye uski rajdhani guwahati main ek nae rajbhavan nirmaan kii aavashyaktaa thi
 For a decade after the new state of Meghalaya came into existence, there was only one governor of Assam and Meghalaya who lived in Shillong
 guwahati circuit house ke kuch kamaron ko samaan rajyapal ke assam daure par aane ke dauraan thaharne ke liye sthai rup se arakshit kiya gaya tha
 But this system was not considered satisfactory and it was decided that a new Raj Bhavan for the Governor of Assam would be built in Guwahati
 laagat kam karne ke liye ek sadgipurn rajbhavan 1980 main nirmit kiya gaya
 But since the governors of the two states were still one and mostly residing in Shillong, the new palace was used more as a governor's camp
 varsh 1989 se assam kaa apana alag rajyapal hona armbh hua
 The reason behind the construction of the Raj Bhavan in Guwahati was the picturesque view of the Brahmaputra River from Kharguli and the low cost of developing the already built Raj Bhavan

 Wet scrubbers can achieve high efficiency removal for either particles or gases and in some instances, both can achieve a high removal efficiency for pollutants in the same system
 haalanki, kai maamalon main, kanon sangrah ke liye sabase acha oparating sharton gas hataane ke liye sabase garib hai
 In general, achieving high simultaneous gas and particle removal efficiencies requires that one of them be readily collected or by the use of a scrubbing-like reagent such as lime or sodium hydroxide

 Human scientists could not find any society where marriage relations are within the family, hence additional membership is provided to the wife in the patriarchal family and the husband in the maternal family
 yugal parivaar main pati or patni milakar apni pruthak gruhasthi sthapit karte hai
 But in most societies this family is considered to be part of the larger family group, and in many cases of life, the family is controlled by the greater family, apart from close association

 Similarly, the rules of income tax also fall against this
 vayask matadhikaar raajnneetik loktantr bhi sanyukt parivaar ke eksattatmak tathaa vyashtiparak astitv par prahaar kar rahe hai
 At a stage when the economy and the means of production are also undergoing fundamental changes, manipulation of the family's governance, structure and functions is inevitable and is also reflected
 kintu abhi yah kahana kathin he ki parivaar kaa sanyukt rup samaapt ho rah he
 There is no evidence that joint families in cities and villages are already reduced

 sameekaran pratikon kii sahaayta se vyakt kiya gaya ek ganitiya kathan he jo do vastuon ko samaan athwa tulya bataata he
 It would not be an exaggeration to say that equations are the most important subject in modern mathematics
 aadhunik vigyaan evam takneekee main vibhinn ghatnaon evam prakriyaaon kaa ganitiya model banane main sameekaran hi aadharaka kaam karne hai
 The parity symbol is used to write the equation
 yatha- Equations are often used to show the equality of two or more expressions
 kisi sameekaran main ek yaa ek se adhik char raashi hoti hai
 The value of a variable amount for which both sides of the equation are equal is called the solution of the equation or the root of the equation
 aisa sameekaran jo char raashi ke sabhi maanon ke liye santusht hota he, use sarvasamika kehete hai
 like - ek sarvasamika he
 whereas ek sameekaran he jiskaa mul hai x = 0 { \ displaystyle x=0} evam x = 1 { \ displaystyle x=1} 
 If an equation is true, then sameekaran ke ek paksh main sthit koi char, achar, vyanjak aadi ko duusare paksh main le jane ko pakshaantar kaha jaataa he
 Difference is very important in solving equations
 pakshaantar karne kaa siddhanth upar varnit sameekaran ke gunon par hi aadhaarit he
 Depending on the nature of the variables contained in an equation, the equation can be classified as follows: vigyaan or takneekee main dizin yaa vishleshan karte samay praayah sameekaran praapt hote hai
 Their solution gives many useful information
 iske alaava aadhunik vigyaan evam takneekee main vibhinn ghatnaon evam prakriyaaon kaa ganitiya model banane main sameekaran hi aadhaar kaa kaam karne hai
 Sankhya is also one of the six types of Indian philosophy which was very popular and famous in ancient times
 yah advait veydant se sarvatha vipareet manyataayen rakhane vaala darshan he
 The original person who founded it is called Kapil
 'sankhya' kaa shabdic arth he - 'sankhya sambandhi' yaa vishleshan
 Its most prominent belief is that the creation is made up of the nature man, here nature is the root and the male conscious
 yoga shastron ke urja strot, shakton ke shiv-shakti ke siddhant iske samaanaantar dikhte hai
 Sankhya philosophy once held a very high place in Indian culture

 The Mahabharata has even said that if knowledge comes, then there are few numerical figures, Mahanmahatma
 vastut: mahabharat main darshanik vichaaron kii jo prishthbhumi he, usamen sankhyashastra kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 The ideas of Samkhya Darshan have been mentioned in many poetic and interesting ways at many places of Shanti festival
 sankhya darshan kaa prabhaav gita main pratipaadit darshanik prishthbhumi par paryaapt rup se vidyaman he
 One of the reasons for its popularity has been that this philosophy has resolved the contrast seen in life in a beautiful manner by repudiating the trinitarian nature as omnipresent
 sankhyacharyon ke is prakruti-kaaran-vaad kaa mahaan gun yah he ki pruthak-pruthak dharm vaale sat, rajas tathaa tamas tatwon ke aadhaar par jagat kii vishmata kaa kiya gaya samaadhaan bada buddhigamya prathit hota he
 By not considering any temporal problem as the law of God, the reason for deteriorating the synergy of these forms and not making effort of the creatures
 yani, sankhya darshan kii sabase badi mahanata yah he ki isamen sristi kii utpatti bhagwaan ke dwaara nahin maani gayi he balki ise ek vikasaatmak prakriya ke rup main samajha gaya he or mana gaya he ki sristi anek anek avasthaaon se hokar guzarane ke baad apane vartmaan swaroop ko praapt hui he
 Kapilacharya is considered by many to be an atheist but this notion has been denied in texts like Bhagavad Gita and Satyarthraprakash
 sankhya-darshan kaa mukhya aadhaar satkaryawad he
 According to this theory, work cannot originate without reason
 faltah, is jagat kii utpatti shunya se nahin kisi mul satta se he
 This theory is contrary to Buddhist nihilism
 kaary, apni utpatti ke purna kaaran main vidyaman rahata he
 Work is the essence of its cause

 The Mahabharata has even said that if knowledge comes, then there are few numerical figures, Mahanmahatma
 vastut: mahabharat main darshanik vichaaron kii jo prishthbhumi he, usamen sankhyashastra kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 The ideas of Samkhya Darshan have been mentioned in many poetic and interesting ways at many places of Shanti Parva
 sankhya darshan kaa prabhaav gita main pratipaadit darshanik prishthbhumi par paryaapt rup se vidyaman he
 In fact, Sankhya philosophy became very popular at some time
 isaki lokapriyata ke or chaahe jo bhi kaaran hon par ek to yah avashya rahaa prathit hota he ki is darshan ne jivan main dikhaai padane vaale vaishamy kaa samaadhaan trigunatmak prakruti kii sarvakaaran rup main pratishtha karke bade sundar dhang se kiya
 The great quality of this nature-cause-debate of Sankhyacharyas is that the solution of the illusions of the world on the basis of the elements of different religions, Rajas and Tamas elements, seems to be very just and wise
 "sankhya" shabd kii nishpatti "sankhya" shabd ke aage anu pratyay jodne se hoti he or sankhya shabd kii vyutpatti saarchaksh dhaatu khyan darshain pratyay taap he, jiske anusaar iskaa arth samyak khyaati, sadhu darshan athwa satya gyaan he
 This due fame of the Sankhyacharyas, this true knowledge of them, lies in the separation of the male form of the Chitta element from the person's form and the dual aspect of the person
 upar-upar se prapanch main sanaa hua dikhaai padane par bhi purush vastut: usase achoota rahata he
 In spite of being seen as indulgent or indulged in it, one remains virtually unattached or uninterested - this greatest philosophical discovery of the Sankhyakaris is treated in his own words by the names Satvapurushanyakhyati, Vivek Khyati, Prakritik Vigyan, etc
 isi vivek gyaan se maanav jivan ke param purusharth yaa lakshya kii siddhi maanate hai
 Thus "number" is an abbreviation to reveal the true form of the greatest philosophical discovery of the word numerology, being the first lecturer, his ideology was named as "samkhya" in very ancient times
 gananarthak "sankhya" shabd se bhi "sankhya" shabd kii nishpatti maani jaati he
 In the Mahabharata, both these types of expressions have been revealed in a verse about Sankhya
 vah is prakaar he- sankhyan prakurvate chaiv prakrutin c prachakshate
 Tattvānti Ch Chatuvinsdān Ten Samkhya: Prakritita:
 iskaa shabdaarth yah he ki jo sankhya arthath prakruti or purush ke vivek gyaan kaa upadesh karte hai, jo prakruti kaa prabhaav pratipaadan karte hai tathaa jo tatwon kii sankhya choubees nirdhaarit karte hai, ve sankhya kahe jate hai
 Some people are of the opinion that the secondary goal of the word "number" in the form of knowledge is considered to be the attainment of Kaivalya or salvation, the ultimate goal of life from the wisdom of nature and man, hence the attainment of that knowledge is the main and For this reason, the whole force of Samkhya is on him
 sankhya choubees tatv maanata he, yah to ek saamaanya tathy kaa kathan maatr he, at: gaun he
 Udayveer Shastri in his treatise entitled "history of Samkhya Darshan" quotes the interpretation of Sridhar Swami on Bhagavata 3-25-1 in being propounded by Kapila of the Samkhya Shastra - the interpreter explaining the last verse clearly It is written - Element number numerator: Sankhya-promoter Ityarth:
 isse nishchit ho jaataa he ki yahi kapil sankhya kaa prarvatak yaa praneta he
 Scribe of Sridhar Swami: On the word, Shastri ji has written in the footnote given below - Some interpreters of the medieval period have interpreted the word "sankhya" in the term "sankhya" as calculative
 vastut: iskaa arth tatv gyaan he
 But considering it deeply, it is not as common or secondary as it seems to be an emergency
 aisa prathit hota he ki bahut pracheen kaal main darshanik vikaas kii praarambhik avasthaa main jab tatwon kii sankhya nishchit nahin ho pai thi, tab sankhya ne sarvapratham is drishyman bhautik jagat kii sookshm mimasaa kaa prayaas kiya tha jiske falswaroop uske mul main vartmaan tatwon kii sankhya saamanyat: choubees nirdhaarit kii thi
 In these also the first element which he named "prakriti" or "pradhan" was proved to be the origin of the remaining twenty three
 chit purush ke saannnidhya se isi ek tatv "prakruti" ko kramash: taees avaantar tatwon main parinat hokar samast jad jagat ko utpann karti hui mana tha
 Thus behind the determination of element number, there seems to be a huge intellectual practice of statistics
 aakhir sookshm buddhi ke dwaara deergh kaal tak bina chintan or vishleshan kiye tatwon kii sankhya kaa nirdhaaran kaise sambhav hua hoga? From the above discussion, it is decided that the "sankhya" name of Sankhya philosophy is indicative of its rational argument with both types
 sankhyon kaa achit prakruti tathaa chit purush, donon hi moolbhoot tatwon ko aagam yaa shruti pramaan se siddh maanate hue bhi mukhyat: anumaan pramaan ke aadhaar par siddh karnaa bhi isi baat kaa parichaayak he
 It is clear from the view of both the Samkhya discourse formulas and the numeric texts available these days that it is proved by the inference based on both the fundamental elements of Samkhya - nature and power of man
 purush kii anekta main bhi yuktiyaan hi di gai hai
 Satirism has also been established on the basis of arguments
 
 Thus the Sravana scripture, which is the foundation of wisdom knowledge, is logic-oriented
 manan, anukaal tarkon dwaara shastrokt tathyon tathaa siddhanton kaa chintan he hi
 Thus, the number or wisdom due to which the Sankhya philosophy got its "sankhya" name has a special relationship with logic and intellectualism
 is buddhivaad ke kaaran avaantar kaal main sankhya darshan ke kuch siddhant vaidic sampradaay se bahut kuch swatantra rup se viksit hue jiske kaaran baadaraayan vyas tathaa shankaracharya aadi aacharyon ne iskaa khandan karte hue avaidic sampradaay, tak kah daalaa
 This sect does not appear to be non-vedic in its origin and in its latter form is also not completely vedic
 prasiddh bhashyakaar vigyanbhikshu ne bhi sankhya ko aagam yaa shruti kaa sat tarkon dwaara kiya jane vaala manan hi mana he
 He has said the same thing in his Sankhya discourse-sutra-annotation of the commentary - "vedic scripture" which removes the entire campaign of male-related Vedic scriptures and to liberate the man from all kinds of religious-devoid forms
 It is said that the narrator Narayanavatar Bhagwan Kapil was born to preach the Sad tips required for contemplating the meaning of those Vedas
