 The process against the multiplication process is called division or division

 The number of times a number or digit is subtracted is divided as many times

 It is clear that if the positive numbers of the divisors and the divisors are whole numbers, then the quotient will be a whole number only if z is the common divisor of A, but if z is between the two consecutive commutations a * r and a *, then r is the quotient and Is called the remainder
 is bhaajan kriya ko 'sashesh bhaajan' kehete hai

 adhikansh deshon main, yah sakal gharelu utpaada ke mahatvapurn ansh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 While international trade has been present for most of its history, its economic, social and political importance has begun to increase in recent centuries
 antarrashtriya vyapaar vyavastha par audyogikaran, unnat parivahan, vaishvikaran, bahurashtriya nigam or bahyasrot se kaarynishpaadan, in sabhi kaa vyapak prabhaav padataa he
 Increasing international trade is important for the continuation of globalization
 antarrashtriya vyapaar ke bina, desh sirf apni khud kii seemaa ke bheetar utpaadit maal or sevaaon tak simit rah jaaenge
 International trade is no different from domestic trade in principle because the motivation and behavior of the parties involved in a trade does not change fundamentally, regardless of whether the trade is cross-border or not
 mukhya antar yah he ki antarrashtriya vyapaar aam taur par gharelu vyapaar se adhik mahangaa he
 The reason for this is that a border usually imposes additional charges such as tariffs, periodic costs due to delays on the border and costs associated with country variations such as language, legal system or culture
 gharelu or antarrashtriya vyapaar ke bich ek or antar yah he ki puunji or shram jaise utpaadan kaarak aam taur par baahar kii tulana main deshon ke bheetar adhik gatisheel hote hai
 Thus international trade is mostly limited to the trade of goods and services and only on a small scale in trade of capital, labor or other factors of production
 In addition, trade in goods and services can act as a substitute for trade in production factors
 utpaadan kaa ek kaarak aayaat karne ke bajaay, ek desh maal aayaat kar saktaa he jo utpaadan ke kaarak kaa gahan istemaal kare or is prakaar sambandhit kaarak ko sammilit kar le
 ek udhaaharan he, china se sanyukt rajya america dwaara shram-pradhan vastuon kaa aayaat
 chini shram kaa aayaat karne ke bajaay america, china se aise maal aayaat kar rahaa he jise chini shram ke istemaal se utpaadit kiya gaya he
 International trade is also a branch of economics, which together with international finance forms the broad branch of international economics

 The Ricardian model focuses on comparative advantage and is perhaps the most important concept in international trade theory
 ek ricardian model main, desh un chizon ke utpaadan main visheshgyata hasil karte hai jin chizon kaa utpaadan ve acha karte hai
 Unlike other models, the Ricardian framework predicts that countries will specialize instead of producing a wide range of goods
 iske alaava, ricardian model kaarak nidhi par sidhe vichaar nahin karata, jaise desh ke bheetar shram or puunji kii saapeksh maatra
 ricardin model kaa pramukh laabh yah he ki yah deshon ke bich praudyogiki bhinnataaon kii kalpana karata he
 The technology gap is easily incorporated into the Ricardian and ricardo-sraffa models
 ricardian model nimnlikhit anumaan lagaataa he: The Ricardian model makes short-term measurements, so the technology varies internationally
 yah is tathy kaa samarthan karata he ki desh apane tulanaatmak laabh kaa paalan karte hai or visheshgyata ke liye anumati dete hai
 The Ricardian business model was studied by Graham, Jones, Mackenzie and others
 sabhi siddhanton main madhyavarti maal, vasteen or puunjigat maal jaise vyapaarit input maal ko baahar rakhaa gaya
 mckenzie, Jones, and Samuelson emphasized that considerable profits would be lost by the exclusion of intermediate goods from trade
 In a famous comment Mackenzie stated that "the idea of a moment would explain to a person that Lancashire would be unlikely to produce cotton cloth if cotton had to be grown in England
" haal hi main, is siddhant ko vistaarit karte hue isamen vyapaarik madhyavarti maamle ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 Thus the "labor only" assumption was removed from the theory
 is prakaar nayaa ricardian siddhant, jise kabhi-kabhi ricardo-srapha model kaa naam bhi diya jaataa he, saidhantik rup se puunjigat vastuon ko shaamil karata he jaise mashine or samagriyaan, jinka deshon ke bich kaarobaar hota he
 In times of global trade, this assumption is more realistic than the heckscher-olin model, which assumes that capital is stable within the country and not internationally dynamic
 1900 ke dashak ke armbh main, do swedish arthshaastriyon, eli heksher or bertil olin ne kaarak anupaat siddhant naam ke ek antarrashtriya vyapaar siddhant kaa srijan kiya
 This theory is also called the heckscher-olin theory
 heksher-olin siddhant is baat par jor detaa he ki deshon ko aise maal kaa utpaadan or niryaat karnaa chahie jise aise sansadhano kii aavashyaktaa ho, jo prachur hon or aise maal kaa aayaat karnaa chahie jise alp-aapurti vaale sansadhano kii aavashyaktaa ho
 This theory differs from the theories of comparative advantage and absolute advantage because these theories focus on the productivity of the production process for a particular commodity
 iske vipareet, heksher-olin siddhant kahata he ki ek desh ko utpaadan or niryaat main un karkon kaa upyog karte hue visheshgy hona chahie jo sabase prachur maatra main hon or isliye saste hon
 un maal kaa utpaadan naa karen, jaisaa ki pehle ke siddhanton ne kaha, jo ve sabase adhik kushalta se utpaadit karte hai
 The Heckscher – Olin model was constructed as an alternative to the Ricardian model of basic comparative advantage
 isaki adhik jatilta ke baavjood yah apane purvanumaanon main adhik sateek sabit nahin hua
 But from a theoretical point of view it provides an elegant solution by incorporating neo-classical value mechanisms into international trade theory
 is siddhant kaa tark he ki antarrashtriya vyapaar kaa pattern, kaarak nidhi main antar se nirdhaarit hota he
 It predicts that countries will export goods that use locally abundant factors and will import goods that use factors that are locally scarce
 H-O model ke saath anubhavjanya samasyaayein, jise leontiff virodhabhas ke rup main janaa jaataa he, wesile leontiff dwaara anubhavjanya pareekshanon main saamne ain jinhone paaya ki puunji kii bahutayat hone ke baavjood america shram-pradhan maalon ko niryaat kar rahaa tha
 The HO model makes the following main assumptions: H-O siddhant ke saath samasya yah he ki yah puunjigat vastuon ke vyapaar ko shaamil nahin karata he 
H-O siddhant main, shram or puunji, prayek desh ke liye sthir padaarth hai
 In a modern economy, capital goods are traded internationally
 madhyavarti vastuon ke vyapaar se laabh kaaphi hota hai, jaisaa ki samuelson dwaara bal diya gaya tha 
 Many economists prefer the Heckscher – Olin theory than the Ricardo theory, as it makes less straightforward assumptions
 1953 main, wesile leontiff ne ek adhyayan prakashit kiya, jahaan unhone heksher-olin siddhant kii vaidhata kaa pareekshan kiya
 adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki anya deshon kii tulana main america puunji main adhik prachur tha, isliye america puunji-pradhan maal kaa niryaat kar rahaa tha or shram-pradhan maal kaa aayaat
 leontiff ne paaya ki aayaat kii tulana main america kaa niryaat kam puunji-pradhan tha
 After the Leontief paradox emerged, many researchers tried to save the heckscher-olin theory, either by new methods of measurement, or by new interpretations
 Leamer emphasized that Leontief did not correctly interpret the HO theory and claimed that contradiction did not occur with a correct interpretation
 brechar or choudri ne paaya ki, agar limar sahi tha, to america mazaduron kii prati vyakti khapat, mazdooron ke vishwa ausat khapat se kam honi chahie
 Later several other tests took place but most of them failed
 kai prasiddh pathyapustak lekhak, jinamein shaamil hai krugman or obstfeld or boven, holender or vien, H-O model kii vaidhata ke bare main nakaaratmak hai
 
 After testing a long history of empirical research, Bowen, Hollander, and VN concluded: "recent tests of the factor abundance theory that directly examine the HOV equations also indicate a rejection of the theory"
 : 321 heksher-olin siddhant ko dakshin-uttar vyapaar samasyaon kaa vishleshan karne ke liye acchhee tarah anukulit nahin kiya gaya he
 Estimates of HO are less realistic regarding NS than NN trade
 uttar or dakshin ke bich aay bhinnata hi ek aisi chiz he jisaki teesri duniya ko sabase zyada parvaah hoti he
 The factor price equalization has not shown much sign of recovery
 HO model maanata he ki deshon ke bich samaan utpaadan kaary karata he
 This is very unrealistic
 viksit or vikasshil deshon ke bich praudyogiki kii bhinnata, garib deshon ke liye chintaa kaa mukhya vishay he
 In this model, labor mobility between industries is possible, while capital is stable between industries in the short term
 is prakaar, is model ko heksher-olin model ke ek 'alpakaaleen' sanskaran ke rup main vyakhya kii ja sakati he
 The specific factor name refers to what is provided, in the short term, specific factors of production such as physical capital are not easily transferable between industries
 siddhant yah suzav detaa he ki agar maal kii keemat main vruddhi hoti he, to us maal ke vishisht sandarbh main utpaadan ke kaarak ke maalikon ko vaastavik rup se acha laabh hoga
 In addition, owners of specific factors of anti-production are likely to have opposing agendas when they seek favors to control labor immigration
 iske vipareet, puunji or shram, donon ke maalikon ko puunji nidhi main vruddhi se vaastavik rup main laabh hota he
 This model is ideal for particular industries
 yah model aay vitaran ko samajhane ke liye adarsh he lekin vyapaar kii paddati kii charchaa karne ke liye bhadda he
 New business theory tries to explain many facts about trade, which is difficult for the two main models outlined above
 isamen yah tathy bhi shaamil he ki zyaadaatar vyapaar, samaan kaarak bandobasti or utpaadakta str or maujuud bahurashtriya utpaadan kii badi maatra vaale deshon ke bich hota he
 In one example of this framework, the economy exhibits monopoly competition and increasing profits on a scale

 Under the belief in mercantilism for many centuries, customs were high and many restrictions on international trade in most countries

 Regulation of international trade is done globally through the World Trade Organization and through many other regional arrangements such as MERCOSUR in South America, the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico, and European between 27 independent countries Union
 The 2005 Buenos Aires negotiations on the planned establishment of the Free Trade Area of the Americas were thwarted mainly by opposition from the population of Latin American countries

 Companies trading across international borders face the same risks normally reflected in staunch domestic transactions

 Of particular importance is the role of governments in deciding whether they will allow international businesses to setup their operations and encourage them to grow and succeed
 aksar, kai deshon kii sarkaron ke liye ek vikalp nahin he lekin antarrashtriya kaarobaar kaa swaagat karne ke rup main ve "nakadi" yaa dollar kii jarurat he, kyonki ve bhi janaa jaataa he
 For example, the difference between exports and imports is known as current account deficit or CAD

 Then, governments can borrow losses at high rates or finance losses through FDI or foreign direct investment and equity flows from fiis or foreign institutional investors to the stock markets
 iske alaava, gharelu udyog kshamtaaon ko ek vishesh kshetra he or na hi visheshgyata he ki kshetra kaa vikaas karne main safal hone ke liye nahin ho saktaa he
 Therefore, FDI becomes necessary for the development of that region

 For this reason, many governments in developing countries are doing something to encourage and allow foreign investment in international businesses to operate the setup in their respective countries

 The important aspect here is that many governments in emerging economies often welcome international businesses with open arms because of the above reasons

 dhvaj The Pallava dynasty was a dynasty of ancient South India
 chauthi shatabdi main isane kanchipuram main rajya sthapit kiya or lagbhag 600 varsh tamil or telegu kshetra main rajya kiya
 Bodhidharma belonged to this dynasty which spread meditation yoga in China
 yah raja apane aap ko kshatriya maanate the
 Pallava Gurjara Dynasty Some scholars have traced the origin of the Pallavas to the Parthian people
 kintu pallav or pahlav naamon kaa dhvanisamya donon kaa tadatmya siddh karne ke liye paryaapt nahin he
 In southern India, the Pahlavas have shown a clear distinction between calling the Pallavas in Uttarapath and Pallavas living in Dakshinapath
 pallav shabd mulat: tamil tondare or tondaman kaa sanskrit rup tha
 Scholars who believe in the Tamil origin of the Pallavas, equate the Pallavas with the Tirair and Gurjars
 ek vidvan ne to pallav shabd ko hi, doodh duhanevaale yaa gwaale ke arth main, tamil bhashaa se niklaa siddh karne kaa asafal praytn kiya he
 On the basis of Manimekhalai, the first Pallava king has also been suggested to consider the truth of a Chola Gurjar and a Nag Rajakanya
 pallav namakaran naag-raaj-kanya ke janmdesh manipallavam athwa pratham pallav ke tondai lata kii shakha kii genduri se bandhaa hua paae jane ke kaaran batalaaya jaataa he
 Some scholars against this believe the northern origin of the Pallavas
 jaiswal ke anusaar pallav vaakatakon kii ek shakha the; ye uttar ke kysth the jinhone sainik vritti apana lee thi
 The cultural traditions of northern India have a clear imprint on the Pallava dynasty
 ve pehle praakrit or baad main sanskrit kaa upyog karte hai
 He holds titles like Dharmamaharaj and Ashwameghayajin
 unki praarambhik shashanvyavastha satvahan paddati or antatogatva arthshaastra main pratipaadit vyavastha se sambandhit he
 But to what extent the northern origin of the Pallavas is proved from all this, it is difficult to decide
 pallvon ko brahman dronacharya or ashwatthama se sambandhit karanevaali anushrutiyaan to he kintu kadambon ke taalgund abhilekh main pallvon ko kshatriya gurjar kaha gaya he jiskaa samarthan huentsang bhi karata he
 Probably they were initially feudatories of the Satavahanas
 unhone kanchi pradesh naagon se liya hoga
 This event would take place after the middle of the second century, when according to the Talmis, the Nagas had the right here
 baad ke kuch abhilekhon main pallav rajvansh kii utpatti goorjaron or bharadwaj se bataai gai he
 Some of the initial names mentioned in these appear to be fictitious, but the historical basis of some events is also possible
 pallvon kaa praarambhik itihaas krambaddh rup se nahin prastut kiya ja saktaa
 On the basis of language for convenience they are divided into Pallavas known from Prakrit Tamrapattas and known from Sanskrit Tamrapattas
 inamen se sarvapratham naam singhvarman kaa he jiskaa guntur abhilekh teesri shatabdi ke antim charan kaa he
 Sivaskandavarman, whose inscriptions are derived from Mayidavolu and Hirahadagalli, dates back to the early fourth century and is most famous among the early Pallavas
 is samay pallvon kaa adhikaar krishna nadi se dakshini penner or bellari tak failaa hua tha
 Sivaskandavarman performed the Ashwamedha Yagna
 uske baad skandavarman kaa rajya hua
 The Tamrapatta from Guntur of Skandavarman, which is preserved in the British Museum, mentions the crown prince Buddhavarman and his son Budhyankur
 kintu iske baad kaa itihaas timirachchann he
 The king of Kanchi, defeated by Samudragupta, was named Vishnugop
 iske baad sanskrit tamrapatt ke pallvon kaa rajyakaal aata he
 From these inscriptions we know the names of many Pallava kings, but it is difficult to determine the relationship and sequence of them all
 kanchi ke rajvansh kii chhin-bhinn shakti kaa laabh uthaakar pallav samrajya ke uttari bhaag main nellore-guntur kshetra main ek samant pallav vansh ne apana swatantra rajya sthapit kiya
 The rulers of this dynasty known from the Tamrapattas can be placed between 375 to 575 AD
 kanchi ke mukhya gharaane ke liye sarvapratham ham chandlur tamrapatt se gyaat skandavarman, uske putr kumarvishnu pratham, pautra buddhavarman or praputra kumarvishnu dwitiya ko rakh sakate hai
 Skandavarman may be the Skandavarman of the Tamrapatta of the British Museum
 iske baad udayediram tamrapatt se skandavarman, uske putr singhvarman, pautra skandavarman tritiy or praputra nandivarman kaa gyaan hota he
 Their relationship with the previously mentioned Pallavas is not known
 kintu singhvarman kaa rajyakaal 436 se 458 i
 tak avashya rahaa
 The mention of Singhvarman and his son Skandavarman also appears in the records of his feudal Ganges
 chhathi shatabdi ke prarambh main shaantiwarman kaa naam gyaat hota he
 Probably the same was also known as Chandand and Kadamba was killed by Ravivarman
 singhvarman dwitiya se pallvon kaa rajyakram sunishchit ho jaataa he
 The glory of the Pallava dynasty was started by his son Singhvishnu
 singhvishnu ne kalbhron dwaara tamil pradesh main utpann raajnneetik avyavashtha kaa ant kiya or chol mandalm par pallvon kaa adhikaar sthapit kiya
 He was a worshiper of Vishnu
 avanisingh uskaa virdohi tha
 He gave his encouragement to the famous Sanskrit poet Bharavi
 mahabalipuram kii varah guha main uski or uski do raniyon kii murtiyan prastar par ubhaari gai he
 Mahendravaman I, the son of Singhvishnu, is counted among the highest emperors of this dynasty
 is mahaan shaasha kii bahumukhi pratibha yuddh or shanti donon hi kshetron main viksit hui
 It was at this time that the struggle of the Pallavas and Chalukyas started
 chalukya naresh pulakeshin dwitiya kii sena vijay karti hui pallav rajdhani ke bilkul sameep pahunch gai thi
 In the battle of Pullalur, Mahendravarman defeated the Chalukyas and reconquered all except the northern parts of the empire
 mahendravarman ne kai virud dhaaran kiye jo uske pratibhashali vyaktitv ke anek gunon kii ore sanket karte hai, yatha mattavilas, vichitrachitt, chetthkaari or chitrakaarpuli
 Some of its rock cut temples are residual in Trichinapally, Mahendravadi and Dalvanur as examples
 usne mahendravadi main mahendra-tataak naam ke jalashay kaa nirmaan kiya
 He was also interested in painting and was also famous as a skilled musician
 usne mattavilas prahasan kii rachana kii thi
 Initially he was a Jain observer, but with the influence of Appar he accepted Shaivism
 phir bhi usne vishnu kii puja ko protsaahan diya kintu jainiyon ke prati vah ashishnu bana rahaa
 Maheshvarman's son Narasimhavarman i was the best emperor of this dynasty
 iske samay main pallav dakshini bharat kii pramukh shakti ban gaye
 He foiled the three invasions of the Chalukya king Pulakeshin II
 in vijayon se utsahit haakar usne apni sena chalukya samrajya par akraman ke liye bheji jisane 642 i
 main chalukyon kii rajdhani vaatapi par adhikaar kar liya
 To commemorate this victory, he assumed the title of Vatapikond
 yuddh main pulakeshin kii mrityu ke kaaran chalukya samrajya avyavasthit rahaa
 As a result, the southern part of the Chalukya Empire remained under the authority of the Pallavas
 pulakeshin ke putr vikramaditya ne 655 main pallvon ko vaatapi chhodane par vivash kiya
 Narasimhavarman invaded Lanka twice to assist Manavarma, the prince of Lanka, and finally regained him the throne of Lanka
 uske liye yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki usne chol, cher, kalbhr or pandavon kaa bhi parajeet kiya tha
 He was opposed to Mahamall
 usne mahabalipuram kaa gaurav badhaayaa
 Here he built some temples or chariots made of the same stone
 640 main chini yatri huentsang pallav samrajya main aayaa
 He has described Tondamandalam and Kanchi
 narsinghvarman ke putr mahendravarman dwitiya kaa rajyakaal do varsh kaa hi tha jisamen use chalukya vikramaditya ke haathon parajeet hona padaa
 Mahendravarman's son Paramesvaravarman i has political significance in successfully opposing the Chalukya king Vikramaditya
 vikramaditya ne pallvon ke shatru pandyon ke saath sandhi kii or apane desh ke apmaan kaa pratikaar karne ke liye pallav rajya par akraman kiya or kanchi ko vijay karata hua kaveri ke dakshini tat par uragpur tak pahunchaa
 Parmeshwarman was not discouraged by his initial failures
 vipakshiyon kaa dhyaan aakarshith karne ke liye usne ek sena chalukya samrajya main bheji jisane vikramaditya ke putr vinayaditya or pautra vijayaditya kaa parajeet kiya
 He himself defeated the invaders in the battle of Peruvallanallur and forced him to leave the Pallava Empire
 mahabalipuram kii kuch kalakritiyaan usee ne banavaai thim
 He was a worshiper of Shiva
 usne kanchi ke sameep kuram main ek shivmandir kaa nirmaan karaayaa
 The quiet and prosperous reign of Narasimha II Rajsingh, son of Parameswaravarman, is notable for the progress of art and literature
 uske mandir apane aakaar or sundarataa ke liye prasiddh he
 The Kailasanath temple at Kanchi and the temple at Mamallapuram are examples of these
 kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar prasiddh kavyashastrajna or gadhylekhak dandin isi ke darbar main tha or yaheen bhaas ke naatakon kaa rangamanch par pradarshanath parivartan kiya gaya tha
 The reason for the prosperity of this period was trade with foreign countries
 sambhavat: vyapaarik hit ke liye hi usne ek rajdootmandal china bheja tha
 He had a special love for Virudon
 usne 250 ke lagbhag oopaadhiyaan grahan kii thim jinamein rajsingh, shankarabhakt or aagamapriy pramukh he
 In the last years of the reign of Narasimhavarman's son Parmeshwarman II, Chalukya Crown Prince Vikramaditya attacked Kanchi with the help of the Ganges
 parameshwaravarman ne bhent aadi dekar akramanakariyon ko lautaaya
 Inspired by the spirit of retaliation, he attacked the Ganga kingdom but was killed in battle
 tiruvadi kaa shivmandir sambhavat: usee ne banwaaya tha
 In the absence of his descendants on the death of Parameshvarman, the state authorities, in consultation with the Ghatika of the learned Brahmins, sat on the throne of the twelve-year-old Nandivarman II Pallavamalla
 He was the son of Hiranyavarman, a descendant of Bhimavarman, brother of Simhavishnu
 pandya naresh marvarman rajsingh ne pallvon ke viruddh kai rajyon kaa ek gut sangathit kiya or chitramaay naam ke vyakti kii sahaayta ke liye, jo apane ko parameshwaravarman kaa putr kahata tha, nandivarman par akraman kiya or use nandigram main gher liya
 But Udayachandra, the commander of the Pallavas, broke the siege of Nandigram, killing Chitramaya and defeating other opponents
 kintu pallvon ke senapati udayachandra ne nandigram kaa gheraa todaa, chitramaay ko markar or duusare virodhiyon ko parajeet kiya
 But the worst calamity of Nandivarman was the invasion of Chalukya king Vikramaditya II
 gangon kii sahaayta se usne 740 i
 ke lagbhag pallvon ko parajeet kar kanchi par adhikaar kar liya
 But by not destroying the city, he gave donations and gifts to the opposite people and thus took revenge on them without frustrating the authority of the Pallavas
 uske shashan ke antim varshon main uske putr kirtivarman ne phir akraman kiya tha
 Dantidurga, the founder of the Rashtrakuta kingdom, also attacked Kanchi, but by demonstrating his power, he married his daughter Reva with Nandivarman
 nandivarman ne gang naresh shripurush ko parajeet kiya or gang rajya kii bhoomi apane baan samant jayandivarman ko di thi
 Nadivarman was defeated at the hands of Pandya King Vargun Maharaj I
 usne pandyon ke viruddh kongu, kerala or tagdur ke shaskaon kaa sangh banaaya kintu pandya naresh apane vipakshiyon ko parajeet karke pallav rajya main pennar nadi ke tat par arshur pahunchaa tha
 Along with the salvation of the old temples, Nandivarman built Mukteshwar, Vaikuntha Perumal and other temples
 vah vaishnav tha
 The famous Vaishnava saint Tirumarga Alwar took place during his reign
 nandivarman swayan vidvan tha
 Dantivarman was the son of Nandivarman and Reva
 rashtrakooton se sambandhit hone par bhi use rashtrakut singhaasana ke liye uttaradhikaar ke sangharsh main bhaag lene ke kaaran dhruv or govind tritiy ke haathon parajeet hona padaa tha
 Pandya Naresh Vargun i had conquered the Cauvery region, but the arrows still remained feudal to the Pallavas
 dantiwarman ke putr nandivarman tritiy ne pallvon kii luptpraaya pratishtha ko punerjeevit sa kar diya
 He was married to Shankha, daughter of Rashtrakuta king Amodhavarsha I
 usne pandyon ke viruddh kai shaktiyon kaa ek sangh banaaya tha
 Pandya Naresh Srimar Srivallabh was defeated in the battle of Tellaru and reached the coast of Vaivagai
 apni vijay ke uplakshya main usne tellaremrid kii oopaadhi grahan kii thi
 But later Srimar defeated Nandivarman and his assistants near Kumbakonam
 syam main takua-paa sthaan se praapt ek tamil abhilekh main uski oopaadhi ke aadhaar par avaninarann naam ke jalashay or vishnu mandir kaa ullekh he
 This gives an indication of the power of the Pallavas and their relationship with foreign countries
 use anya virud the varatungan or ugrkopan
 He was Shaiva
 usne tamil sahityakar perudevanar ko prashray diya tha
 Nripatungavarman, born of the Rashtrakuta queen of Nandivarman, retaliated the defeat of his father by defeating Pandya Naresh Vargun II in the battle of Sripuramniyam near Kumbakonam, shortly after he ascended the throne
 usne pallav "samrajya kii simaaon ko akshunn rakhaa
 It is known from the records that in the field of education and governance, the Pallavas played a role for the Cholas
 nripatungvarman kaa putr aparajit is vansh kaa antim samrat tha
 Aditya I, the feudal lord of the Pallavas, increased his power and defeated the Aparajita almost in 893 and annexed the Pallava kingdom into the Chola kingdom
 is prakaar pallav samrajya kaa astitv samaapt hua
 Some branches of the Pallavas also ruled some places later
 13veen shatabdi main coperunjing naam ke samant ne apni swatantra satta sthapit karne kaa praytn kiya
 Although he used to call himself Pallava, it is difficult to relate him to the Pallava emperors
 aadhunik loktantr kii koi aisi sunishchit sarvamaanya paribhaasha nahin kii ja sakati jo is shabd ke peeche chhipe hue sampurna itihaas tathaa arth ko apane main samahit karti ho
 Different thinkers have given different definitions in different eras, but it has always accepted that a democratic system is one in which the people have sovereignty
 janata kaa kya arth he, samprabhutaa kisi ho or kaise sambhav ho, yah sab vivaadaaspad vishay rahe hai
 Yet, as far as the definition of democracy is concerned, Abraham Lincoln's definition - democracy is for the people, for the people and rule by the people - is considered authentic
 loktantr main janata hi sattadhari hoti he, uski anumati se shashan hota he, uski pragati hi shashan kaa ekmaatr lakshya mana jaataa he
 But democracy is not only a specific type of governance, but also a special kind of political organization, social organization, economic system and a moral and mental sense
 loktantr jivan kaa samgr darshan he jisaki vyapak paridhi main maanav ke sabhi pahalu aa jate hai
 The soul of democracy is the sovereignty of the people, the definition of which has been changing over the ages
 ise aadhunik rup ke aavirbhaav ke peeche shatabdiyon lanbaa itihaas he
 Although Roman imperialism did not make any political contribution to the development of democracy, yet at the time of Roman civilization, stoic thinkers supported human equality on a spiritual basis, which is the great quality of the democratic system
 siciro, sineka tathaa unke purvavarti darshanik jenon ek prakaar se bhavi loktantr kii naitik aadharshila nirmit kar rahe the
 From the twelfth and thirteenth centuries in the Middle Ages, the seeds of anti-monarchy movement and public sovereignty can be seen
 europe main punarjagran evam dharmasudhar andolan ne loktantratmak siddhanton ke vikaas main mahatvapurn yoga diya he
 This movement emphasized the religious freedom of the individual and tried to limit the power of the king
 loktantr ke vartmaan swaroop ko sthir karne main chaar krantiyon, 1688 kii england kii raktahin kranti, 1776 kii amareeki kranti, 1789 kii francisi kranti or 19veen sadi kii audyogic kranti kaa bada yogadan he
 The glorious revolution of England ensured that Parliament should be approved against the backdrop of administrative policy and state laws
 amareeki kranti ne bhi lokprabhutv ke siddhant kaa poshan kiya
 The French Revolution gave strength to the principle of freedom, equality and fraternity
 audyogic kranti ne loktantr ke siddhant ko aarthik kshetra main prayukt karne kii prerana di
 Generally, democracy-governance is to be considered of two types: vah shashanvyavastha jisamen desh ke samast naagarik pratyaksh rup se rajyakarya sampadan main bhaag lete hai pratyaksh loktantr kehalaati hai
 In this type of democracy, a decision is taken only after consultation with the people in public interest work 
 prasiddh darshanik ruso ne es loktantr ko hi adarsh vyavastha mana he
 This type of democracy was found in the city states of ancient Greece
 vartmaan main switzraland main pratyaksh loktantr chalata he
 The Greeks confined their democratic principles to only minority Greek citizens
 yunaan ke nagar rajyon main basanevaale daason, videshi nivaasiyon tathaa striyon ko raajnneetik adhikaron se vanchit rakhaa gaya tha
 In most countries nowadays, representative democracy or indirect democracy is propagated in which public expression is expressed by the elected representatives of the people
 janata kaa shashan vyavastha or kanoon nirdhaaran main koi yogadan nahin hota tathaa janata swayan shashan na karte hue nirvachan paddati ke dwaara chaynit shashan pranali ke antargat nivas karti he
 There is a difference of opinion among those who describe this type of system as the basic idea of modern democracy
 aajkal saamanyatya do prakaar ke paramparaagat loktantreey sanghathanon ko chunaav paddati dwaara sweekaar kiya jaataa he - sansadatmak tathaa adhyakshatmak
 The fact of the parliamentary system is that the public elects members of Parliament for a fixed term
 sansad dwaara mantrimandal kaa nirmaan hota he
 The Cabinet is responsible to the Parliament and the members are responsible to the public
 adhyakshatmak vyavastha main janata vyavasthapika or kaaryakarini ke pradhan raashtrapati kaa nirvachan karti he
 Both of them are not directly responsible for each other but directly and for different people respectively for legislative and administration respectively
 is shashan vyavastha ke antargat raashtra kaa pradhan hi vaastavik pramukh hota he
 Thus, the nature of all governance in a democracy is based on the ideal of limited power based on public consensus
 loktantr keval shashan ke rup tak hi simit nahin he, vah samaaj kaa ek sanghathan bhi he
 Democracy as a social norm is a society in which there is no privileged class and no person is discriminated against on the basis of caste, religion, varna, lineage, wealth, sex etc
 is prakaar kaa loktantreey samaaj ko loktantreey rajya kaa aadhaar kaha ja saktaa he
 An alliance with economic democracy is necessary for the success of political democracy
 aarthik lokantatr kaa arth he ki samaaj ke prayek sadsy ko apane vikaas kii samaan bhautik suvidhaayen milen
 There should not be much economic disparity between people and one person cannot exploit another person

 Jyeshtha Shukla Ekadashi Vikram Samvat 1954, Rama Prasad, born in Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh on Friday, died at the age of 30, Paush Krishna Ekadashi, on Monday, Vikram Samvat 1984
 unhone san 1916 main 19 varsh kii aayu main krantikari maarg main kadam rakhaa tha
 In the revolutionary life of 11 years, he wrote many books and published them himself
 un pustakon ko bechakar jo paisa mila usase unhone hathiyaar kharide or un hathiyaaron kaa upyog british raaj kaa virodh karne ke liye kiya
 11 books were published during his lifetime, most of which were confiscated by the government
 bismil ko tatkaaleen sanyukt praant agra va avadh kii lakhanu central jail kii 11 nambar barrack main rakhaa gaya tha
 In this prison, along with other members of his team, all of them were historically prosecuted for conspiring against the British Raj
 bismil ke dada ji narayan laal kaa paitruk gaanv barbai tha
 The village was in Morena district of Tomarghar region, situated amidst the ravines of the Chambal river in the then Gwalior state and is presently in Madhya Pradesh
 barbai gram-vaasi aaye din angrezon va angrezi aadhipaty vaale gram-vaasiyon ko tang karte the
 Due to family feud, Narayan Lal left his ancestral village with his wife Vichitra Devi and two sons - Muralidhar and Kalyanmal
 unke gaanv chhodane ke baad barbai main keval unke do bhai - amaan singh va samaan singh hi rah gayi jinke vanshaj aaj bhi usee gaanv main rahete hai
 Today, a statue of Ram Prasad Bismil has been installed by the Madhya Pradesh government in a park in Barabai village
 vahiin 'barbai' gram ko 'saansad adarsh gram yojana 'ke tahat bhi viksit kiya ja rahaa he
 Apart from this, a temple of Bismil in Morena and 'amar Shaheed Pt Ramprasad Bismil Museum' has also been built at the district headquarters, which provides information about the immortal martyrs of Chambal region and historical and ancient sites of the region
 kaalaantar main yah parivaar uttar pradesh ke aitihaasik nagar shahjahanpur aa gaya
 Narayan Lal got a job at an attar shop located near the gate of Munnuganj in Shahjahanpur for just three rupees a month
 itane kam paise main unke parivaar kaa guzaaraa nahin hota tha
 Bismil's grandmother, Vichitra Devi, started grinding grains to get her husband's hand
 yah silsilaa lagbhag do-teen varshon tak chalata rahaa
 Local people often addressed him as "pandit ji" due to his ethics, honesty and religious tendencies
 isse unhen ek laabh yah bhi hota tha ki prayek teej - tyohaar par daan - dakshina va bhojan aadi ghar main aa jaaya karata
 Meanwhile, Narayan Lal got a job in a school with the help of local residents for seven rupees monthly
 kuch samay pashchaat unhone yah naukari bhi chhod di or rejgaari bechney kaa kaarobaar shuru kar diya
 With this, they started earning five-seven daily

 After marriage, Muralidhar got a job in Shahjahanpur municipality at a monthly salary of Rs 15
 kintu unhen yah naukari pasand nahin aayi
 a few days later, he quit his job and started selling stamp paper in the court
 is vyavsaay main unhone acha khaasaa dhan kamaaya
 Three bullock carts started running on rent and also started lending money on interest
 11 june 1897 ko uttar pradesh ke shahjahanpur shahar ke khiranibagh muhalle main janme ramprasad apane pita muralidhar or mata moolmati kii duusari santaan the

 "both the parents were of Leo zodiac and the child also looked like a lion-cub, so astrologers thought very carefully and suggested the name of Libra sign
 mata-pita donon hi ram ke aradhak the atah balak kaa naam ramprasad rakhaa gaya
 Mother Moolmati always said that she wanted a son like Rama
 balak ko ghar main sabhi log pyaar se ram kahkar hi pukaarte the
 Before the birth of Ramprasad, his mother had lost a son, so the use of witchcraft was also taken
 ek khargosh laayaa gaya or navjaat shishu ke upar se utaar kar aangan main chhod diya gaya
 The rabbit made two or four rounds of the courtyard and died instantly
 iskaa ullekh ram prasad bismil ne apni aatmakatha main kiya he
 Muralidhar had a total of 9 children, including five daughters and four sons
 aage chalakar do putriyon evam do putron kaa bhi dehant ho gaya
 From childhood, special attention was paid to the education of Ramprasad
 uskaa man khilne main adhik kintu padhane main kam lagata tha
 Because of this his father used to beat him a lot, but mother always used to explain with love that "son Ram! This is a very bad thing, don't do it
" " is pyaar bhari sikh kaa uske man par kahin na kahin prabhaav avashya padataa
 His father first made the letter sense of Hindi, but neither did he learn to read an owl from u nor showed it by writing
 un dinon hindi kii varnmaala main u se ullu hi padhaayaa jaataa tha
 He was opposed to this and in return also ate his father's body
 haar kar use urdu ke skool main bhartee kara diya gaya
 Perhaps this natural quality can make Ramprasad a revolutionary
 lagbhag 14 varsh kii aayu main ramprasad ko apane pita kii sandukchi se rupee churaane kii lat pad gayi
 With the stolen money, he started reading by buying novels etc
 and also got used to smoking cigarettes and offering cannabis
 kul milakar rupee - chori kaa silsilaa chalata rahaa or ramprasad ab urdu ke premuras se paripurna upanyaason va gajalon kii pustaken padhane kaa aadi ho gaya tha
 Incidentally one day Ramprasad was caught stealing because of cannabis being drunk
 khub pitayee hui, upanyaas va anya kitaaben faad daali gayin lekin rupee churaane kii aadat nahin chhuti
 Later, when he understood a little, only then could he be free from this badness
 ramprasad ne urdu middle kii pariksha main uteern na hone par angreji padhanaa prarambh kiya
 At the same time, a priest of the neighborhood got Ramprasad knowledge of the method of worship
 pujari ek sulajhe hue vidwaan vyakti the
 His personality also had an impact on Ramprasad's life
 pujari ke upadeshon ke kaaran ramprasad puja-paath ke saath brahmacharya kaa paalan karne laga
 Ramprasad also started exercising after seeing the priest
 kishoravastha kii jitani bhi kubhaavnaayen evam buree aadaten man main thim ve bhi chhot gayin
 Cigarette smoking did not stop
 parantu vah bhi kuch dinon baad vidhyalay ke ek sahpaathee sushilchandra sen kii satsangati se chhot gayi
 After giving up cigarettes, Ramprasad's mind started studying
 bahut sheeghra hi vah angreji ke paanchaven darze main aa gaye
 There was an unexpected change in Ramprasad
 sharir sundar va balishtha ho gaya tha
 Time was spent in regular worship
 isi dauraan vah mandir main aane vaale munshi indrajit se uskaa sampark hua
 Munshi Indrajit told Ramprasad about the Arya Samaj and gave the book Satyarth Prakash written by Swami Dayanand Saraswati
 satyarth prakaash ke gambheer adhyayan se ramprasad ke jivan par ascharyajanak prabhaav padaa
 When Ramprasad was an eighth grade student at Government School Shahjahanpur, then by chance, Swami Somdev came to the Arya Samaj Bhavan
 munshi indrajit ne ramprasad ko swamiji kii seva main niyukt kar diya
 It was here that changes in both the condition and direction of his life began
 ek ore satyarth prakaash kaa gambheer adhyayan va duusari ore swami somdev ke saath raajnneetik vishyon par khuli charchaa se unke man main desh-prem kii bhaavana jaagrit hui
 At the Congress session of 1916, when Ramprasad took out the procession of Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak in the entire Lucknow city, while disguising the order of the late Pt
 adhiveshan ke dauraan unka parichay keshav baliram headgavar, somdev sharma va mukundilal aadi se hua
 Later these same Somdev Sharma along with some Siddhagopal Shukla also published a book from the Nagari Sahitya Library, Kanpur titled - History of American Independence
 yah pustak babu ganeshprasad ke prabandh se kurmi press, lakhanu main san 1916 main prakashit hui thi
 Ramprasad published this book from his mother with two hundred rupees in two times
 iskaa ullekh unhone apni aatmakatha main kiya he
 This book was confiscated as soon as it was printed and later when the Kakori case was prosecuted, this book was presented as evidence
 ab yah pustak sampadit karke sarfaroshi kii tamanna naamak granthavali ke bhaag-teen main sankalit kii ja chuki he or teen murti bhawan pustkaalay, nai-dilli sahit kai anya pustakaalayon main dekhi ja sakati he
 On hearing the news of the hanging of Bhai Parmanand in 1915, Ramprasad had pledged to destroy the British Empire, a book had come out in 1916, some young men had joined him, they had also received the blessings of Swami Somdev
 ek sanghathan unhone pan gendaalal dikshit ke maargdarshan main matruvedi ke naam se khud khadaa kar liya tha
 a commercial and a pledge were also published on behalf of this organization
 dal ke liye dhan ekatra karne ke uddeshy se ramprasad ne, jo ab tak 'bismil' ke naam se prasiddh ho chuke the, june 1918 main do tathaa sitambar 1918 main ek - kul milakar teen dakaiti bhi daaleen, jisase police satark hokar in yuvakon kii khoj main jagah-jagah chaape daal rahi thi
 In the Congress session held in front of the Red Fort in Delhi from 26 to 31 December 1918, the youth of this organization started selling books as they screamed that the police raided but all the books were saved due to Bismil's understanding
 pandit gendaalal dikshit kaa janm yamuna kinare sthit may gaanv main hua tha
 He was a teacher in the DAV school of Auraiya, a famous town in Etawah district
 deshbhakti kaa junun savaar hua to shivaji samiti ke naam se ek sanstha bana lee or hathiyaar ekatra karne shuru kar diye
 He was caught bringing weapons to Agra
 kile main kaid the vahaan se police ko chakma dekar rafuchakkar ho gayi
 After the merger of Bismil's maternal institution with the Shivaji Committee, the two worked together
 ek baar pun: pakade gayi, police peeche padi thi, bhaag kar dilli chale gayi jahaan unka praanant hua
 Bismil has given a very touching description of Pandit Gendalal ji in his autobiography
 mainpuri shadyantra main shahjahanpur se 6 yuvak shaamil hue the jinke leader ramprasad bismil the kintu ve police ke haath nahin aaye, tatkaal faraar ho gayi
 On 1 November 1919, Magistrate b s Chris pronounced the Mainpuri conspiracy
 jin-jin ko sajaayen huin unamem mukundilal ke alaava sabhi ko farvari 1920 main aam maafee ke elaan main chhod diya gaya
 Bismil remained underground for the entire 2 years
 unke dal ke hi kuch saathiyon ne shahjahanpur main jaakar yah afvaah failaa di ki bhai ramprasad to police kii goli se maare gayi jabaki sachai yah thi ki ve police muthbhed ke dauraan yamuna main chalaang lagaakar pani ke andar hi andar yogabhyas kii shakti se tairte hue milon dur aage jaakar nadi se baahar nikle or jahaan aajkal greater noida aabaad ho chukaa he vahaan ke nirjan bihadon main chale gayi
 There used to be only acacia trees in those days; And the man did not appear anywhere in the desert
 ram prasad bismil ne yahan ke ek chote se gaanv rampur jaagir main sharan lee or kai maheene yahan ke nirjan jangalon main ghoomte hue gaanv ke gujaron kii gaay bhens charaayi
 He has described this very interestingly in the second volume of his autobiography: Swadesh Prem
 yaheen rahakar unhone apana krantikari upanyaas bolshevikon kii karatuut likhaa
 In fact, this novel is originally a Hindi-translation of the book nihilist-rahasya written in Bangla language, whose language and style are both very interesting
 aravind ghosh kii ek ati uttam bangla pustak yogic saadhan kaa hindi - anuwaad bhi unhone bhumigat rahete hue hi kiya tha
 In those days, the land on the banks of Yamuna was considered safe to escape from the police, so Bismil made full use of that safe place
 vartmaan samay main yah gaanv chunki greater noida ke beta van sector ke antargat aata he at: uttar pradesh sarkaar ne rampur jaagir gaanv ke kshetra main aane vaali van vibhaag kii arakshit bhoomi par unki smriti main amar shahid pan ram prasad bismil udyaan viksit kar diya he jisaki dekharekh greater noida prashasan ke vitt-poshan se pradesh kaa van vibhaag karata he
 a feature of 'bismil' was also that they did not stay at any place for long
 kuch din rampur jaagir main rahakar apni sagi bahan shastri devi ke gaanv kosma jila mainpuri main bhi rahe
 Interestingly, even his own sister could not recognize him
 kosma se chalakar bah pahunche
 After a few days, then from Pinhat, Agra, went to his grandfather's village Barabai in the princely state of Gwalior
 unhone vahaan kisaan ke bhes main rahakar kuch dinon hal bhi chalaaya
 While living in exile, he translated the English book The Grandmother of Russian Revolution published in 1918 in Hindi
 unke sabhi saathiyon ko yah pustak bahut pasand aayi
 He named this book Catharine
 itnaa hi nahin, bismil ne sushilmala siries se kuch pustaken bhi prakashit kin thim jinamein man kii lahar naamak kavitaaon kaa sangrah, catherine yaa swadhinata kii devi - catherine brashkovsky kii sankshipt jeevani, swadeshi rang va uparokt bolshevikon kii karatuut naamak upanyaas pramukh the
 Apart from the indigenous color, all three books are available in the libraries for common readers nowadays
 sarkari elaan ke baad ram prasad bismil ne apane vatan shahjahanpur aakar pehle bharat silk manufaccharing company main manager ke pad par kuch din naukari kii uske baad sadar bazaar main reshmi saadiyon kii dukaan kholkar banarsilaal ke saath vyapaar shuru kar diya
 In the business he earned both Naam and Naama
 congress jila samiti ne unhen lekha pareekshak ke pad par kaaryakari cameti main le liya
 In September 1920, he joined the Calcutta Congress as an authorized representative of the Shahjahanpur Congress Committee
 kalkatte main unki bhent lala lajpat raay se hui
 When Lala ji saw the books written by him, he was very impressed with them
 unhone unka parichay kalakatta ke kuch prakashkon se kara diya jinamein ek umadutt sharma bhi the, jinhone aage chalakar san 1922 main ram prasad bismil kii ek pustak catherine chhaapi thi
 At the Ahmedabad Congress Session of 1921, Ramprasad 'bismil' openly supported Maulana Hasrat Mohani on the proposal of Purna Swaraj and finally got Gandhiji to pass a resolution to start the non-cooperation Movement
 is kaaran ve yuvaaon main kaaphi lokapriy ho gayi
 The volunteers of Shahjahanpur played an important role in starting the non-cooperation movement throughout the country
 kintu 1922 main jab chaurichaura kand ke pashchaat kisi se paraamarsh kiye bina gandhi ji ne asahyog aandolan waapas le liya to 1922 kii gaya congress main bismil va unke saathiyon ne gandhi ji kaa aisa virodh kiya ki congress main phir do vichaardhaarayen ban gayin - ek udaaravaadi yaa libral or duusari vidrohi yaa rebelion
 Gandhi always used to call the young men of rebellious ideology in the Congress general meetings due to their opposition
 ek baar to unhone jawaharlal nehru ko patr likhakar krantikari navayuvakon kaa saath dene par buree tarah fatkaar bhi lagaayi thi
 In January 1923, wealthy people like Motilal Nehru and Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das formed a Swaraj Party
 navayuvakon ne tadarth party ke rup main revolutionari party kaa elaan kar diya
 In the special Congress session of Delhi held in September 1923, the disgruntled youths decided that they too would start interfering in politics by fixing their party's name and constitution etc
 Otherwise the loot system would dominate in the name of democracy in the country
 dekha jaye to us samay unki yah badi doordarshee soch thi
 The well-known revolutionary Lala Hardayal, who was working in those days to strategize to free India from abroad, was in contact with Ram Prasad Bismil since the time of Swami Somdev
 lala ji ne hi patr likhakar ram prasad bismil ko shachindranath sanyaal va yadu gopal mukherjee se milakar nayi party kaa samvidhan taiyaar karne kii salaah di thi
 Following the advice of Lala ji, Ram Prasad went to Allahabad and prepared the party's constitution at Shachindranath Sanyal's house
 navgathit party kaa naam sankshep main ech aar e rakhaa gaya va iskaa samvidhan pile rang ke parche par chhap karke sadasyon ko bheja gaya
 On 3 October 1924, an executive-meeting of this party was held in Kanpur, in which many prominent members of Shachindranath Sanyal, Yogesh Chandra Chatterjee and Ram Prasad Bismil etc
 attended
 is baithak main party kaa netritv bismil ko saunpkar sanyaal va chatarji bengal chale gayi
 Due to the difficulty of collecting funds for the party, the method of revolutionaries of Ireland was adopted and the first robbery was committed by the party in Bamrauli on 25 December 1924, which was efficiently led by Bismil
 iskaa ullekh chif court of avadh ke faisle main miltaa he
 Ram Prasad Bismil, in the 4-page pamphlet "the Revolutionary", published by the revolutionary party from an anonymous place on 1 January 1925 and distributed to all major places throughout India between 28 and 31 January 1925, under the pseudonym Vijay Kumar While disclosing in writing in writing the party's ideology, it was declared in clear terms that what kind of change in the governance system of this country's revolutionary Want to run and what can they do for it? Not only this, while mocking Gandhi's policies, he also asked why the person who calls himself spiritual is afraid to talk openly to the British
 He had given an open call to all the youth of India to join the revolutionary party by advising such pseudo-mahatma not to fall under the influence of the British
 di revolutionari ke naam se angreji main prakashit is krantikari main krantikariyon ke vaicharik chintan* ko bhalee-bhanti samajha ja saktaa he
 The infamous Hindi poetry of this paper is now also available on Hindi Wikisource
 di revolutionari naam se prakashit is 4 prishthiya ghoshnaptr ko dekhte hi british sarkaar iske lekhak ko bengal main khojane lagi
 Incidentally, Shachindra Nath Sanyal was arrested in Bankura when he was going to post this manifesto to a colleague
 isi prakaar yogeshchandra chatarji kanpur se party kii meeting karke jaise hi haavda stesan par train se utre ki ech aar e ke samvidhan kii dher sari pratiyon ke saath pakad liye gayi
 He was imprisoned in Hazaribagh jail
 donon pramukh netaaon ke giraftaar ho jane se ram prasad bismil ke kandhon par uttar pradesh ke saath-saath bengal ke krantikari sadasyon kaa uttardaayitv bhi aa gaya
 Bismil's nature was that he either did not take any work in hand and once he took the task in hand, he would not leave it without completing it
 party ke kaary hetu dhan kii aavashyaktaa pehle bhi thi kintu ab to or bhi adhik bad gayi thi
 Seeing that money was not received from anywhere, he committed two political dacoities on 7 March 1925 in Bichpuri and on 24 May 1925 in Dwarkapur
 parantu unhen unamem kuch vishesh dhan praapt nahin ho sakaa
 In these two robberies, one person was killed on the spot
 isse bismil kii aatma ko apaar ksht hua
 Finally, he made sure that he would now only loot the state treasury, not to rob the house of any of the nobles of India
 shahjahanpur main unke ghar par 7 agast 1925 ko hui ek immergency meeting main nirnay lekar yojana bani or 9 agast 1925 ko shahjahanpur railway stesan se bismil ke netritv main kul 10 log, jinamein ashfak ulla khan, rajendra lahidi, chandrasekhar aaazaad, shachindranath bakshi, manmathanath gupt, mukundi laal, keshav chakravarti, murari sharma tathaa banavaari laal shaamil the, 8 down saharanpur-lakhanu paisanger railgadee main savaar hue
 In addition to the pistols, all of them had four German-made Mauser pistols, with a butt in the butt that looked like a small automatic rifle and caused fear in the front
 in moujaron kii maarak kshamta bhi saadhaaran pistolon se adhik hoti thi
 In those days, these mausers were known like today's A-47 rifles
 lakhanu se pehle kakori railway stesan par ruk kar jaise hi gaadi aage badi, krantikariyon ne chen khinchakar use roak liya or guard ke dibbe se sarkari khajaane kaa baksaa neeche gira diya
 An attempt was made to open it but when it did not open, Ashfaq Ulla Khan grabbed his master Manmath Nath Gupt and took the hammer and broke the box
 manmathanath gupt ne utsukathavash moujar kaa trigar dabaa diya jisase chhuti goli ahamed ali naam ke musafir ko lag gayi
 He piled on the spot
 shighratavash chaandi ke sikkon va noton se bhare chamade ke thile chaadaron main baandhakar vahaan se bhaagane main ek chadar vahiin chhot gayi
 The next day this news spread through the newspapers through the whole world
 british sarkaar ne is train dakaiti ko gambheertha se liya or di ai ji ke sahaayak mistar aar e harton ke netritv main scotland kii sabase tej tarraar police ko isaki jaanch kaa kaam saunp diya
 The CID, after a serious investigation, confirmed to the government that the Kakori train robbery is a planned conspiracy by the revolutionaries
 police ne kakori kand ke sambandh main jaankaree dene va shadyantr main shaamil kisi bhi vyakti ko giraftaar karwaane ke liye inaam kii ghoshnaa ke vigyaapan sabhi pramukh sthanon par laga diye
 As a result of this, the police found that the sheet was found by someone from Shahjahanpur only because of the washer's mark on the sheet found at the scene
 shahjahanpur ke dhobiyon se poochne par maaloom hua ki chadar banarsi laal kii he
 The police obtained all the distinction by meeting Banarsi Lal
 yah bhi pataa chal gaya ki 9 agast 1925 ko shahjahanpur se uski party ke koun-koun log shahar se baahar gayi the or ve kab-kab waapas aaye? jab khufia taur se is baat kii pushti ho gayi ki ram prasad bismil, jo ech aar e kaa leader tha, us din shahar main nahin tha to 26 sitambar 1925 kii raat main bismil ke saath samooche hindustan se 40 se bhi adhik logon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Only 10 people actually participated in the Kakori case, so all of them were nominated
 inamen se paanch - chandrasekhar aaazaad, murari sharma, keshav chakravarti, ashfak ulla khan va shacheendra nath bakshi ko chhodkar, jo police ke haath nahin aaye, shesh sabhi vyaktiyon par abhiyog chalaa or unhen 5 varsh kii kaid se lekar phaansi tak kii sajaa sunaayi gayi
 Apart from the absconding accused, 16 of the revolutionaries who were arrested on suspicion of being active activists of H
R
A

 Not only this, before sending the case to the sessions court, all the witnesses and evidence were collected so that even if an appeal is made, not a single accused should be released without conviction
 banarsi laal ko hawalat main hi police ne kadi sajaa kaa bhay dikhaakar tod liya
 In the Shahjahanpur District Congress Committee, this Banarasi had a fight with Bismil over the party fund
 bismil ne, jo us samay jila congress cameti ke auditor the, banarsi par party-fund main gaban kaa aarope siddh karte hue use congress party kii praathmik sadsyta se nilambit kar diya tha
 Later, when Gandhiji came to Shahjahanpur on 16 October 1920, Banarasi met him and made his stand
 gandhi ji ne us samay yah kahkar ki choti-moti hera-pheri ko itnaa tool nahin dena chaiye, in donon main sulah kara di
 But Banarsi was a very sly man
 usne pehle to bismil se maafee maang lee phir gandhi ji ko alag le jaakar unke kaan bhar diye ki ramprasad bada hi apradhi kism kaa vyakti he
 They neither believe anything about it nor allow anyone else to do it
 aage chalakar isi banarsi laal ne bismil se mitrataa kar lee or mithi-mithi baton se pehle unka vishwaas arjeet kiya or uske baad unke saath kapade ke vyapaar main saajheedaar ban gaya
 When Bismil formed his own party criticizing Gandhiji, Banarasi Lal was overjoyed and kept quiet in search of an opportunity
 police ne sthaneey logon se bismil va banarsi ke pichley jhagade kaa bhed jaanakar hi banarsi laal ko apruvar banaaya or bismil ke viruddh puure abhiyog main ek achook aujaar kii tarah istemaal kiya
 Banarasi Lal, being a partner in trade, knew such secret things related to the party, which no one but Bismil could have known
 iskaa ullekh ram prasad bismil ne apni aatmakatha main kiya he
 The 11 district barracks of the Lucknow District Jail, which was then called the Central Jail of the United Provinces, housed all the revolutionaries together and built a temporary court in a luxurious building called Ring Theater near Hazratganj intersection
 ring theatre naam kii yah building kothi hayaat baksh or mallika ahad mahal ke bich hua karti thi jisamen british afasar aakar film va naatak aadi dekhakar manoranjan kiya karte the
 In the same ring theater for 18 consecutive months, the British government spent 10 lakh rupees when the value of gold used to be 20 rupees in a historic trial in the name of King Imperial Versus Ram Prasad 'bismil' and Others
 british hukmaranon ke aadesh se yah building bhi baad main dhaha di gayi or uski jagah san 1929-1932 main ji pi o lakhanu ke naam se ek doosraa bhavy bhawan bana diya gaya
 When India became independent in 1947, the Nehru government completed the true task of installing a grand statue of Gandhiji here

 In this landmark case, Harkarnanath Mishra was appointed as the lawyer of the revolutionaries from government expenditure, while Jagatnarayan 'mulla', a well-known lawyer in relation to Jawaharlal Nehru, was made a government lawyer under a thoughtful strategy
 jagat narayan ne apni ore se sabhi krantikariyon ko kadi se kadi sajaa dilwane main koi kasar baaki na rakkhi
 It was the same Jagat Narayan against whose will Bismil organized a grand procession of Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak in the entire city of Lucknow in 1916
 isi baat se chidh kar mainpuri shadyantra main bhi inhen mullaji ne sarkari vakil kii haisiyat se kaaphi jor lagaaya parantu ve ram prasad bismil kaa ek bhi bal bankaa na kar paye kyonki mainpuri shadyantra main bismil faraar ho gayi the or do saal tak police ke haath hi na aaye
 On 6 April 1927, Special Sessions Judge A
 Hamilton, in a 115-page decision, considering the charges leveled against each revolutionary, wrote that this was not a simple train robbery, but a planned conspiracy to overthrow the British Empire
 haalaanki inamen se koi bhi abhiyukt apane vyaktigat laabh ke liye is yojana main shaamil nahin hua parantu chunki kisi ne bhi na to apane kiye par koi pashchaatap kiya he or na hi bhavishya main is prakaar kii gatividhiyon se swayan ko alag rakhane kaa vachan diya he atah jo bhi sajaa di gayi he soch samaj kar di gayi he or is haalat main usamen kisi bhi prakaar kii koi chhot nahin di ja sakati
 However, if any of these accused expresses remorse in writing and pledges not to do so in future, the Upper Court may consider their appeal
 faraar krantikariyon main ashfak ulla khan or shacheendra nath bakshi ko bahut baad main police giraftaar kar paayi
 An additional case of Kakori conspiracy was filed in the court of Special Judge J
 R
 Bennett and on 13 July 1927, Ashfaq Ullah Khan was hanged and sentenced to life imprisonment to Shachindranath Bakshi, repeating the same thing

 Ram Prasad Bismil made his own defense because at the government expense he was given a big simple lawyer named Laxmishankar Mishra, which he refused to take
 bismil ne chif court ke saamne jab dharapravaah angreji main faisle ke khilaaf bahes kii to sarkari vakil mullah ji baglein jhaankate najar aaye
 On this reasoning ability of Bismil, Chief Justice Louis Shurtas had to ask him - "mr
 Ramprasad! From which university you have taken the degree of law?" At this he laughed and said- "excuse me sir! a kingmaker did not require Anne's degree
" " adaalat ne is jawaab se chidhkar bismil dwaara 18 july 1927 ko di gayi swayan vakaalat karne kii arji khaarij kar di
 He then presented a 76-page argumentative written debate

 Ultimately, the court allowed the same Laxmishankar Mishra to argue, which Bismil refused to take
 kakori kand kaa mukadmaa lakhanu main chal rahaa tha
 Pandit Jagatnarayan Mulla was a poet of Urdu along with the government lawyer
 unhone abhiyukton ke liye "muljiman" kii jagah "mulajim" shabd bol diya
 What was it then, Pandit Ram Prasad 'bismil' blatantly lashed out at him with a sarcasm: "don't tell me, mooljim, we are very sorry; we have brought it here with the help of the court
" palat dete hai ham mauje-hawadis apni jurrat se; ki hamane aandhiyon main bhi chiraag aksar jalaaye hai
 "he meant that he is not a servant, but a mullah who earns salaries from the government
 ve to raajnneetik bandi hai at: unke saath tameez se pesh aayen
 Along with this he also warned that they have the power to reverse even the waves of the sea with their audacity; What is the big deal to overturn the case? Who dared after speaking so much that would have stayed in front of Bismil
 mullah ji ko paseene chhot gayi or unhone kanni kaatane main hi bhalaai samajhi
 They quietly slipped through the back door

 All the revolutionaries, except Shachindra Nath Sanyal, Bhupendra Nath Sanyal and Banwari Lal, appealed in the Chief Court
 22 agast 1927 ko jo faisla sunaaya gaya uske anusaar ram prasad bismil, rajendra nath lahidi va ashfak ulla khan ko ai pi si kii dfa 121 va 120 ke antargat aaajeevan karawas tathaa 302 va 396 ke anusaar phaansi evam thakur roshan singh ko pehali do dfaaon main 5+5 = kul 10 varsh kii kadi kaid tathaa agali do dfaaon ke anusaar phaansi kaa hukum hua
 Shachindra Nath Sanyal, while in jail, had expressed his remorse in writing and had pledged not to take part in any future revolutionary action
 iske aadhaar par unki umr-kaid barkaraar rahi
 Shachindra's younger brothers Bhupendra Nath Sanyal and Banwari Lal had confessed to their crime and had already given the undertaking to face any punishment of the court, so they did not appeal and the order for imprisonment of 5-5 years remained unchanged
 chif court main apil karne ke baavjood yogeshchandra chatarji, mukundi laal va govindcharan car kii sajaayen 10-10 varsh se badhaakar umr-kaid main badal di gayin
 The decorations of Suresh Chandra Bhattacharya and Vishnusharan Dublish also remained the same
 khubasurat handriting main likhakar apil dene ke kaaran keval pranavesh chatarji kii sajaa ko 5 varsh se ghataakar 4 varsh kar diya gaya
 Ramnath Pandey was the least punished in this case
 manmathanath gupt, jinaki goli se musafir maaraa gaya, kii sajaa 10 se badhaakar 14 varsh kar di gayi
 Since the cartridges of the Mauser pistol used in the Kakori case were purchased on the arms license of Premkrishna Khanna, due to sufficient evidence, Premkrishna Khanna was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment of 5 years
 chif court kaa faisla aate hi samooche desh main sansani fail gayi
 Thakur Manjit Singh Rathore informed the Central Legislative Council to submit a proposal to convert all the hanged prisoners of Kakori case to life imprisonment
 kauncil ke kai sadasyon ne sar wiliam moris ko, jo us samay sanyukt praant ke governor the, is aashay kaa ek prarthana-patr bhi diya kintu unhone use asweekaar kar diya
 78 members of the Central Council sent the then Viceroy and Governor General Edward Frederick Lindley Wood with a signed memorial in Shimla, prominently Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, NC Kelkar, Lala Lajpat Rai, Govind Vallabh Pant , Etc
 had signed but they had no effect on the Viceroy

 The Chief Court in its decision also wrote this matter
 iske baavjood vysarai ne unhen saaf manaa kar diya
 Finally, barrister Mohan Lal Saxena prepared and sent the documents for clemency petition in the Privy Council to England's renowned lawyer SL Polak
 parantu landan ke nyaayadhishon va samraat ke vaidhanik salaahkaaron ne us par badi sakht daleel di ki is shadyantr kaa sutaradhar ram prasad bismil bada hi khatarnaak or peshewar apradhi he
 If he is granted pardon, he can commit a bigger and more terrible scandal in future
 us sthiti main sarkaar ko hindustan main shashan karnaa asambhav ho jaayegaa
 The result of all this was that the appeal for clemency sent to the Privy Council was also rejected

 bismil ke balidaan kaa samachar sunakar bahut badi sankhya main janata jail ke phatak par ekatra ho gayi
 The main gate of the jail was kept closed and Bismil's body was handed over to his family by breaking the wall in front of the gallows house

 Stunned by this incident, Bhagat Singh wrote the pseudonym 'rebel' in the character of January 1928: "while carrying on the gallows you said very loudly - 'vande Mataram! Bharatmata ki Jai!' And walking in peace, he said - 'O master, you are the one who remains, and you are the one, and neither can i live or be my father; as long as your body lives in blood, your mention and your good will remain!' Standing on the gallows, you said - 'I wish the downfall of the British Empire! That is, i want the fall of the British Empire!' After this the lion said - 'now there are neither Ahle-valvle nor the crowd of arrogance, the desire to eradicate one is now in the heart! Then prayed to God and started reading a mantra

 Ramprasad ji hanged
 " At the end of his article Bhagat Singh writes - "today that hero is not in this world

 The Gandhis who had been completely invisible from the political arena from 1922 to 1927, now after the sacrifice of Ram Ji Prasad Bismil and his colleagues, again changed their attitude and started electing the President of their choice in the Congress and implementing the policies they wanted

 Along with Gandhiji, the British Empire pretended to keep Kokila Sarojini Naidu in the Aga Khan Palace of Yerwada with all the facilities, to arrest Dr
