 In India, monuments of national importance are historical, ancient or archaeological structures, sites or places located in India, which, under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958, through the Archaeological Survey of India, the Federal Government of India or State governments are protected by them

 Such monuments are declared to be of "national importance" under a legal process, and then subjected to the Archaeological Survey of India, to meet the criteria of this Act, so that they are properly looked after, in view of their historical significance

 Each of these drawn pictures has six straight lines that are either broken or un-broken or both

 These are called "pa kuan" or eight "trigrams"
 in aath trigraamon main se prayek ko ek duusare se milakar aath baar guna karne se gunanfal 64 shadrekhakritiyaan hota he jaise : According to tradition, the creation of eight trigrams is considered by the first ancient emperor Fu-si

 doosraa, sabhi shadrekhakritiyein kii prayek vyaktigat rekha ke abhipraayon ke naam evam sanketan kaa vivaran unke sthanon evam paristhitiyon ke anusaar detaa he
 These two texts are similar to the Vedas and the Brahmanas
 jis prakaar bhartiya darshan kii chah paramparaagat shakhaayen shaddarshanon ke naam se prachlit hai : Nyaya Vaisesika, Samkhya, Yoga, Mimamsa and Vedanta
 usee prakaar china darshan ko usee sankhya ke samaan shakhaayen "liu chia" ke naam se prachlit hai : "ju-chia" or Confucian branch, "tao-chia" or Tao branch, "mo-chia" or Mohist branch, "pha-chia" yaa vidhigya shakha, "yin-yang chia" yaa vishwavigyaan shakha tathaa "ming-chia" yaa taarkik shakha
 Just as six branches of Indian philosophy can be merged into three groups: nyaay vaisheshik sankhya yoga or mimasaa vedant; Similarly, in the same numbers, six branches of Chinese philosophy can be combined into groups: canaphyusius kii vidhigya shakha, tao kii vishwavigyaan sambandhi shakha tathaa mohist taarkik shakha
 The Confucian branch was named after Confucius, who was considered the first and greatest master in both learning and virtue, and who first taught the masses the virtue and virtue, whose monopoly was previously held by the elite ruling class
 atev canaphyusius ke anuyaayi anya vastuaan kii apeksha gyaan evam sadgun kaa aadar karte the
 In a book called "lun-yu" or Confucius's collection of literary tableaux, Confucius first mentions the word "hsuyeh" which means to learn
 guru ne kaha tha : "nirantar udyog evam prayog se siikhnaa, kya yah ek manohar vastu nahin he?" 
 Thereafter, on several occasions, Confucius discussed or disputed knowledge with his followers
 "guru ne kaha, 15 varsh kii avasthaa main maine gyaan praapt karne kaa sankalp kiya
 At the age of 30, i was determined
 40 kii avasthaa main mujhe koi andeh nahin tha
 At the age of 50, i realized the orders of God
 60 kii avasthaa main meraa kaan satyagrahan karne kaa aagyaakaari bana
 At the age of 70, he began to understand that which my heart wished and in doing so did not overstep the truth
 pun: guru ne kaha, "das kutumbo ke chote gram main mere samaan pratishthit or sachcha vyakti to mil saktaa tha kintu gyaan kaa itnaa premi nahin mil saktaa tha
 
 canaphyusius ke anusaar gyaan or chintan donon nishchay hi saath saath hona chahie
 The Guru said, "knowledge is to destroy without exertion; contemplation without knowledge is frightful
 " 
 Even thinking and knowledge together are not enough
 unke saath kaary bhi hona chahie
 In other words, both knowledge and thought must be used
 canaphyusius kii bhavanaayen evam vichaar nijee taur par naitik, nitishastreey, saamaajik evam maanviya hai
 Confucius has deliberately ignored some insurmountable problems
 canaphyusius kii saahitiyik jhaankiyon ke sagrah main yah batalaaya gaya tha ki jin vishyon par guru ne baaten kii ve ye thim : vicitra vastuen, atiprakritik shakti, vastuen jo uchit kram main na hen or, pret evam devtaa 
 Once his follower Chi-lu asked him about serving the Prants and the gods
 guru ne kaha : "jab tum manushyon kii seva karne yogya nahin ho, tab kis prakaar tu preton or devataaon kii seva kar sakate ho?" chi-lu ne kaha : "main mrityu ke sambandh main poochne kaa saahas karata hoon
 "he was again answered," When you do not know about life, how can you know about death? "
 canaphyusius ne sway ek baar apane anuyaayi ju-kung sa kaha : "main na bolnaa adhik pasand karuunga
 "ju-kul asked:" If you don't speak Guru, your followers, what do we write to people? "the Guru said:" Does God speak? The four seasons follow their own path and things are created continuously, but does God say anything? "
 canaphyusius ke pashchaat is shakha ke do anya mahaan vyakti main-ju yaa mensius or sun-ju hue
 Both revered Confucius as the greatest master and explicitly followed the same teachings: but they interpreted Confucius differently and their outlooks varied
 unke madhya sabase pradhan antar maanav swabhaav ke siddhanton se sambadh rakhata tha
 Mencius considered human nature to be fundamentally good
 meng-ju : pustak 2 a, adhyay 6
 But Sun Joo said: "human nature is bad; its goodness is attained by teaching
 " 
 But Confucius himself once said: "by nature, humans are almost identical; in practice they become very different from one another
 " 
 This is one of the most controversial problems in Chinese philosophy
 darshan kii vidhigya shakha, sahi artho main, raajnneetik siddhanton kii ek paddati he jisamen swatantra rup se canaphyusius, tao or mohist anuyaayion ke vichaaron ore aadarsho kaa vilyan he
 But it has more relation to both of them than before
 at: iskaa adhik lagaav canaphyusius shakha se he
 "tao" is highly important, comprehensive and mysterious in Chinese language and literature
 kabhi kabhi iskaa arth nirpeksh vaastaviktaa yaa satat satya hota he
 Sometimes its meaning is taken from the fundamental goal or the supreme power of nature
 kabhi kabhi iskaa arth sristi kii abhivyakti yaa sristi ke vikaas kii prakriya yaa maarg hota he
 Sometimes it also means principle and virtue
 yah sanskrit ke teen shabd, brahm, dharm or maarg ke samanarthak he
 Its description is found in almost all the Chinese religious, literature especially religious and philosophical works and has been used in all different aspects which have been used for different things in different ways
 tao shakha vishesh rup se tao ke naam kii adhikari he kyanki isane maao ko adhik visheshta se, adhik uchit rup se or adhik gaharaai se anya shakhaon kii apeksha spasht he
 The greatest and most famous Guru of the Tao Branch was actually lao-tzu, who is believed to be the originator of Tao philosophy
 lao-tju ke baad doosraa mahaan guru chuang-ju hua he
 Lao-tzu considers the "tao" as the highest soul of the universe, self-centered, absolute and eternal in which all things arise and merge again
 "tao-tju" naamak pustak main jo uske naam kii he yaa "tao ti ching" - tao or ti kii dharmik vyavastha, usne kaha tha : "tao ek paidaa karata he, ek do paidaa karata he, do teen paidaa karata he, teen sabhi vastuen paidaa karata he
 "
 usee pustak ke duusare lekhaansh main, tao-tju ne kaha tha : sansar main sabhi vastuen "you" yaa dhan se paidaa hui hai; or "you" yaa dhan kii utpatti "vu" yaa nirdhantaa se hui he
 
 yahan "you" yaa dhan kaa arth tao se he
 Why is Tao called "woo" or poverty? Because the Tao is something that is thought to be imperceptible and inexplicable by name or word
 isaliye lao-tju ne pustak ke bilkul aarambh main hi kaha tha : "vah tao" jo vyakt ho vastav main shaashvat naam nahin he
 Truth is the beginning of heaven and earth
 Story is the mother of all things
 lao-tju ke anusaar "tao" prayek vastu ke liye prayek vastu kaa nirmaankarta bhi he
 Yet it seems that it does not manufacture anything
 prayek vastu ke liye prayek vastu kaa karta he
 Yet it seems that it does nothing
 is prakaar usne kaha tha : "tao" kabhi kuch nahin karata, phir bhi isi ke dwaara sabhi vastuen hoti hai
 Re "is such a field of omnipotent power that it can function by" Tao "alone
 kyonki "tao" anubhavathit evam aparimey vastu he
 Irrational, inexperienced; Even then it has a built in shape
 anubhavathit evam aparimey; phir bhi isamen aakaar antarhit he
 Experiential and irrational; Yet there are powers under them
 yah chhayaatmak or mand he, phir bhi iske andar ek nirpeksh satta he
 This absolute power is extremely pure but still influential
 " 
 Therefore men should follow the path of "tao" and should not act against it at any cost
 tao kaa dwitiya mahanatam anuyaayi guru chuang chaauu yaa chuang ju hua he
 It also presented the principles of "tao" more deeply and broadly than Tao Xu
 vah china kaa sabase mahaan rahasywaadee bhi samajha jaataa he
 His fundamental idea is to achieve absolute equality and freedom from every living being
 saath hi saath purna ekta or sabhi jeevon ke saath abhinnata sthapit karnaa he
 There should be no distinction of any kind such as "good or bad", "good or bad", "big or short", "tall or short", "high or low", "rich or poor", "noble or ordinary" "," Buddha or young man "," beginning or end ", life or death etc
 kyonki ye sabhi manushyakrut saapeksh pad hai
 In fact all these are another integral because all creatures are born from the same "tao" and will merge in the same "tao"
 kathinaayee is baat kii he ki jab ye sabhi vastuen ek baar banaai gayi tab manushyon na keval algaav or bhed hi dekha kintu moulik ekta or abhinnata kaa kuch bhi dhyaan nahin rakhaa
 This was the reason for all biases and ignorance
 saath hi saath isi kaaran sangharsh evam kalah, ghrinaa or shatruta, hinsa or nirdayata, karawas evam daastaa or anek anya buree baaten samay samay par har prakaar kaa ksht ore du:kha detii rahi hai
 Until we finish all these things, real freedom and happiness will not be seen in the world
 keval unheen vyaktiyon ko nirpeksh swatantraaa evam purna sukh praapt hoga jo apane ko sabhi prakaar ke bhedon evam vibhedon se mukt rakhenge
 Such persons have been labeled by Chua-ju as "chen Jan" meaning true man
 unhen "chih-jine" arthath purna purush, yaa "shen-jine" aadhyatmik purush, yaa "shekh-jine" arthath rishi yaa sant kii bhi sangya di he
 It was said by Chuaङ-ju concerning the true person, the perfect person, the spiritual person, the sage or saint, "there is no temper under the perfect person, there is no perfection in the spiritual person; there is no name of a sage or saint
 " or "pracheen sachcha vyakti na jivan ko prem kii drushti se dekhtaa tha or na bhrit ke prati ghrinaa kii bhaavana thi
 While living he did not even experience great bliss and while dying he did not resist
 jaan boojhkar usne yah bhulane kaa praytn nahin kiya ki uskaa prarambh kya tha or yah bhi khojane kaa praytn nahin kiya ki uskaa ant kya hoga
 He happily accepted whatever came to him and left the arm without consciousness
 ise "tao" kii apeksha chaitanya man ko adhik variyata na dena kehalaata he, yaa prakruti ko vyakti kaa poorak kehalaata he
 This is what we call a true person

 vishwavigyaan sambandhi shakha kaa darshan do vishwavigyaan sambandhi siddhanton par aadhaarit he, arthath "yin" or "yaks"
 Hence their name is "yin-yan Chia" or branch of cosmology
 jaisaa pehle hi varnit he, "yin" or "yaks" shabd pehle "yi-ching" yaa parivartanon kii pustak main prakat hue the or us "yaks" kaa arth vyavahrut or purushochit siddhant yaa shakti he or "yin" kaa arth nishedhak or striyochit siddhant yaa shakti he
 The whole world originated from these two equations
 inaki vyakhya gambhirthapurvak evam vyapak rup se canaphyusius evam taaon donon ke anuyaayiyon dwaara kii gai he
 But the philological philosophers used these two principles by taking the "yin" and "yan" of each of the subtlest aspects of human life
 yah shakha vastav main adhik yaa kam canaphyusius or tao vichaardhaaraon kaa sanmishran he
 But they have more to do with the Tao ideology than Confucius ideologies
 isaliye yah tao vichaardhaara se sambadhit he
 The Mohist branch is named after Mo-ti or Moju, who is generally believed to be the father of this branch
 pracheen chini itihaas main mo-ju ek mahatvapurn vyakti mana jaataa he
 In many perspectives, Mo-ju is compared to ancient Indian Mahavir Jain and modern Indian Mahatma Gandhi
 unke jivan env siddhant bahut hi samaan he
 Mo-ju's most important principles are world-wide and non-violent altruism and romanticism
 mahaan canaphyusius kaa anuyaayi mensius ne ek baar kaha tha- "mo-ju" sabhi manushyon ko bina kisi bhed bhav ke prem kii drushti se dekhte hai
 If you could benefit the world by sweating your entire body from head to ankle, then he was ready to do so
 mo-ju ke purv chini vichaardhaaraon main vishvaprem evam ahimsa, pararthwaad or yatitvvaad ke vichaar milte the
 But Mo-ju's great work was in the field of Chinese philosophy, he not only practiced these principles himself, but he set them on a logical foundation and molded them into a philosophical method
 mo-ju ne na keval canaphyusius or unki shakha ke siddhanton kaa virodh kiya, balki pracheen china ke paramparaagat anushthanon evam sansthaaon kaa bhi virodh kiya
 The followers of Confucius tried their utmost, "that they should be right in policy, without thinking of the result without profit; be honest in their principles without thinking that the result will be praiseworthy and beneficial
" " 
 But the followers of Mo-ju and Mohist branch laid great emphasis on merit and benefits
 mo-ju ne kaha : "jo log sadguni hai unka uddeshy vishwa ke liye laabh praapt karnaa he or uski aapattiyon kaa niraakaran karnaa he
 "and" mutual love leads to mutual benefit
 " pun: "nishpaksh prem se laabh hoga
 "and the best is produced by loving and benefiting with others
 pun: "jo dusron se prem karata he usase duusare bhi prem karte hai
 " mo-ju kaa doosraa mahatvapurn siddhant uskaa yuddh ke viruddh upadesh dena he
 According to Mo-ju, the greatest crime is to attack a country
 aise kaary ke liye koi bahaanaa nahin hona chahie
 This preaching of Mo-ju was the medicine of attitudes prevalent in the mutual relations of the states of that time
 aaj bhi vishwa ko paristhiti ke anusaar yah aushadhi kaa kaam de sakati he
 In Chinese, the logical branch is called "min chia" which literally means "branch of names"; Or "p" ian-che, meaning debater or meaning also from ancient Greek scholasticists or logicians
 ham log yahan "tarkikon" shabd kaa prayog karte hai kyonki ve paashchaatya darshan ke tarkikon ke samaan vyavahrut hote hai
 The fundamental principles of this branch have already been enunciated by Confucius, lao-tzu, Mo-ju, and especially Mohists
 tarkikon ne keval unhen sunishchit chini darshan main viksit kiya isliye ve mohist shakha se sambadhit hai
 The most important representatives of this branch are the following: hiy-shih or kung- sun ku Hie Shih's book "one-woo-shuo" or Essay on the Ten Thousand Grants that was lost long ago
 ku sun lu kii kriti "lu-sun-ku-ju" kii pramanikta sandehatmak he
 Those of us who know about his doctrines are the "shih Shih" or the Ten Problems of Hi Shih, and arh-shih-yi-shih or kun-sun-lun
 And there are 21 problems of other logics
 ye samasyaayen adhiktar virodhabhas ke rup main samajhi jaati hai
 In fact, these are not contradictions but philosophical and scientific questions, elemental and direct, authoritarian and cosmological, scholastic and logical problems: they are all examples of the relativity of things in the world
 mukhya vishay ye hai : Therefore, the conclusion of Hie Shih is: "all things should be seen with respect to love, heaven and earth are one
" " Although many different ideas and theories are prevalent in different branches of Chinese philosophy; Nevertheless, they have a commonality in many things
 is prakaar ekatv main vishmata or nanaatv main ekatv kaa pradarshan miltaa he
 Just as the ultimate goal of all the different systems of Indian philosophy has been liberation or salvation, or the freedom of humanity, similarly the extreme goal of many branches of Chinese philosophy is "shi-shih" and "shi-zen" or the world and humans
 Has been liberating from caste
 swatantraaa or mukti donon purnataa kii ek avasthaa hai
 Perfection means real bliss
 vaastavik anand sachhee shanti, prem, saamanjasy, swatantraaa, samanta or ekta he
 All these things are not the accomplishment of any other world, but their accomplishment should be considered in this world right now and now
 isaliye chini darshan kii sabhi bhinn bhinn shakhaayen maanav jivan or nitishastra par adhik bal detii hai
 Ethics has a very wide meaning in Chinese language
 yah maavan ke bich ke sambandhon ke hi sambandh main keval nahin batalaata he, balki manushya or prakruti ke madhya ke sambandh kaa bhi varnan karata he or manushya or sabhi anya jeevon or vastuon ke sambandh main bhi prakaash daalata he
 According to Chinese philosophy, humanity is the life of harmonious collectivism and not the life of individual and prohibitor doing strong industry
 maanavtaa kaa antim lakshya or abhipraay sabhi maanav jati ke liye mangal prapti honi chahie, na vyakti, na jati or na rajya hi antim lakshya hona chahie

 Firewalls are used to prevent unauthorized Internet users from using personal networks connected to the Internet, primarily the Intranet
 All messages that go out of the intranet or enter in go through the firewall
 The firewall checks all messages and prevents messages that do not meet the specified security criteria
 fyrwal takneekon ke kai prakaar hai : a firewall is a dedicated device, or a computer, that monitors network traffic passing through it and allows routes to be rejected or passed depending on the rules
 yah ek software yaa hardware he jo aam taur par ek surakshit network or ek asurakshit network ke bich main rakhaa jaataa he or yah ek dwaar kii tarah kaary karata he jo sunishchit karata he kii koi bhi nijee chiz baahar nahin ja rahi he or durbhaavnapurna chiz andar nahin aa rahi he| The basic function of a firewall regulates the level of traffic flow between computer networks of different trust levels
 Typical example is internet which is an area which is not trusted and internal network which is an area of high trust
 An area of intermediate trust level, which is located between the Internet and a fully internal network, is often referred to as a "perimeter network" or demilitarized zone

 It was a fairly basic first generation system in terms of a highly developed and technical internet security facility
 AT&T Bell Laboratories, k Bill Cheshwick and Steve Belovin were doing their revision on packet filters and developing models based on the original first generation architecture for their company
 'packet" jo internet par data ko transafar karne ke liye buniyadi ikai he uskaa nirikshan karne kaa kaam packet filter karte he| yadi packet, packet filter ke niyamon ke set ko match karata he to packet filter packet ko chhod detaa he yaa asweekaar karata he| This type of packet filter is part of an existing stream of packet traffic that does not pay any attention to it
 Instead, it filters each packet based on the information contained in the packet itself
 sabase zyada sanchaar TCP or UDP protocol se hota he or kyonki TCP or UDP prakhyat port kaa upyog yatayaat sammelan main acchhee tarah se prayog karte hai, is liye yatayaat kaa vishesh prakaar, "rajyaviheen" packet filter ke bich ke antar ko alag kar saktaa hai or is tarah ke yatayaat kaa niyantran kar saktaa he,janaa jaataa he, yatayaat ke un prakaar ke aise, jab tak ki packet filter ke prayek paksh par mashiinon donon hi gaiyr maanak port kaa upyog kar rahe hai| The packet filter firewall works on the first three layers of the OSI reference model, which means that work occurs between all network and physical layers
 When a packet originates from the source and goes through the firewall, the device matches any rules of the packet filter configured in the firewall and drops or rejects the packet accordingly
 When the packet passes through the firewall, it filters the packet based on the protocol / port number
 For example, if the firewall has a rule that prevents the use of telnet, the firewall will block the IP protocol of port number 23
 anuprayog parat ko chaanane ke mukhya laabh yah he ki yah kuch anuprayogon or protocol ko "samaj" saktaa hai, or yah pataa laga sakate hai ki avaanchit protocol gaiyr maanak port ke madhyam se ghusaa ja rahaa he yaa phir protocol kaa kisi bhi tarah se hanikaarak durupyog kiya ja rahaa he| An application firewall is more secure and reliable than a packet filter firewall because it works on all seven layers of the OSI reference model, from application to physical layer
 This is similar to a packet filter firewall, but here we can also filter information based on content
 The best example of an application firewall is ISA Server
 An application firewall can filter high layer protocols such as FTP, TELNET, DNS, DHCP, HTTP, TCP, UDP and TFTP
 For example, if an organization has to block all information related to the word "foo" then filter content can be activated on the firewall specifically for the word segment
 It is a software based firewall and thus it is much slower than a stateful firewall

 This technology is commonly known as a stateful packet inspection because it keeps a record of all connections passing through the firewall and is definitely capable of detecting whether the packet is either the beginning of a new connection, the existing one
 a part of the connection, or is an invalid packet
 Although there is still a set of static rules in such a firewall, the state of the connection itself is a criterion that triggers specific rules

 The first device system known as "visas" was a visual integration interface with colors and icons that Microsoft known products Windows or Apple Make OS | Can be easily available and built on computer operating system
 In 1994, an Israeli company, Check Point Software Technology, built it as readily available firewall-1 software

 Stateful firewalls maintain context about active sessions and use "state information" to speed packet processing
 Any existing network connection can be described by several properties such as the source and destination IP address, TCP or UDP port and the current phase of the connection's life
 If a packet does not match an existing connection, it will be replaced by a new connection
 Is evaluated according to the rules
 If the packet matches the connection, it is passed without any processing, based on a comparison with the state pane of the firewall

 They can filter based on protocols, TTL values, netblock of author's source, and many other properties

 Firewalls often have the functionality to hide the truth of protected armies

 Champu is a distinction of audio poetry, that is, mixed poetry of prose-verse is called Champu
 gadhy tathaa padya mishrit kavy ko "champu" kehete hai
 This mode of poetry has not been mentioned by the ancient masters of literature - Bhamah, Dandi, Vamana etc
 yon gadhy padyamay style kaa prayog vaidic sahitya, buddha jataka, jatakamala aadi ati pracheen sahitya main bhi miltaa he
 The beginning of the Champukavya tradition is derived from the Atharva Veda
 champoo naam ke prakrut kavy kii rachana dasvin shatee ke pehle nahin hui
 'nalchampu', composed by Trivikram Bhatt, which is an early tenth century work, is a famous example of Champu
 iske atirikt somdev suri dwaara rachit yashatilak, bhojraj krit champoo ramayana, kavi karnapuri krit anandavrindavan, gopal champoo, nilkantha champoo or champoo bharat dasvin se satrahavin shatee tak ke udhaaharan hai
 This poetic form could not become more popular nor did it get special recognition in poetry
 hindi main yashodhara ko champoo-kavy kaha jaataa he, kyonki usamen gadhy-padya donon kaa prayog hua he
 The proper division of this mixture of prose and verse seems to be that the description of affective subjects should be presented by verse and descriptive subjects should be presented by prose
 parantu champurchayitaaon ne is manovaigyanik vaishishty par vishesh dhyaan na dekar donon ke sanmishran main apni swatantra ichha tathaa vaiyaktik abhiruchi ko hi mahatv diya he
 The mixture of prose-poetry is ancient in Sanskrit literature, but the poetic style, the possessive noun of "champu", cannot be considered as ancient as the compositional mixture of prose-verse
 gadhy-padya kii mishrit rachana krishna yajurvedic samhitaon main uplabdh hoti he
 Pali natives also have the achievement of the storyline in prose and the original formulaic allusions in verse
 parantu kavyatatv se virahit hone ke kaaran inhen ham "champu" kaa drushtaant kisi prakaar nahin maan sakate
 The Prayagprashasti of Samudragupta composed by Harishan and the Buddhist poet Ayanshur Praneeth Jatakamala can be considered primitive forms of Champu, as in the first, the Digvijay of Samudragupta and 34 Jatakas in the second are described in elaborate prose verse taking shelter of pure poetic style
 prathit hota he ki champu gadhykavy kaa hi ek paribrihit rup he or isiliye gadhykavy ke suvarnyug ke ananthar navam shatee ke aasapaas is kavyarup kaa udai hua
 The first paradigm of Champu poetry is the Nalchampu of Trivikram Bhatt in which the characteristic of Champu springs up
 dakshin ke rashtrakutvanshi raja krishna ke pautra, raja jagatug or lakshmi ke putr, indraraj ke aashray main rahakar trivikram ne is ruchir champu kii rachana kii thi
 The coronation of Indraj was in the year 972 and due to his dependence, the poet also has the same time as the first half of the tenth century

 granth main us yug ke naanavidh dharmik, aarthik tathaa saamaajik vishyon kaa vivaran somprabhasuri kii vyapak tathaa bahumukhi vandushi kaa parichaayak he
 Many talented poets have demonstrated their talent by reciting the virtues of Rama and Krishna
 aise champu kaavyon main bhojraj kaa ramayana champu, anantbhatta kaa "bharat champu", shesh shrikrishna kaa "parijataharan champu" kaaphi prasiddh hai
 Bhojraj had composed the Ramayana Champu till the Kishkindha scandal, which was completed by Lakshman Bhatt, "yudh Kand" and Venkatraj composed the "uttara Kanda"
 jain kaviyon ke samaan chaitanya mataavlambee vaishnav kaviyon na apane siddhanton ke pasar ke liye is lalit kavyamadhyam ko badi safalataa se apanaaya
 The theme of Lord Sri Krishna's Lalaam Leelas is such a beautiful occasion when these poets presented the offerings of their extraordinary talent to the devout readers through their champu poems
 kavi karnpur kaa anandavrindavan champu, tathaa jeev goswami kaa gopalchampu saras kavy kii drushti se nitant safal kavy hai
 The first of these poems gives a detailed and vivid description of Krishna's balalilas, the second verse is a poignant description of Krishna's entire character
 "virmitroday" ke prakhyat rachayita mitra mishra kaa "aanandakand champu" krishnaparak champuon main ek ruchir shrunkhlaa jodta he
 In South India too, Champukyas were not less popular

 Sri Vaishnava Venkatadhwari's "vishvagunadarsha Champu" is unique from other champs in that it has inaugurated the defects and virtues in many of India's numerous pilgrimages, religions and scribes together
 yah vishesh lokapriy kavy he
 The "chitrachampu" of Vanishvara Vidyalankar is a composition of a typical Pandit poet of Bengal in which Bhakti's attainment by Bhakti is indicated through a succinct narrative in Rupakshali
 is prakaar sanskrit sahitya main bhaavon ke prakaton ke nimitt anek shatabdiyon tak lokapriy madhyam hone par bhi uttar bhartiya bhashasahitya main champu kavy drudhmul na ho sakaa
 Generally, in the literature of Dravidi language, especially in Kerala and Andhra literature, Champu poetry is popular even today, which attracts the attention of poets towards the practice
 barbar bhashaayen uttar africa ke barbar logon kii mul bhashaayen hai
 From a linguistic perspective, they are considered to be members of the afro-asian or Semitic language family
 barbar bhashaaon ke chah pramukh shakhaayen hai - Those who speak the barbaric language of one branch do not fully understand the dialect of any other branch because the words and accents in these branches are different
 barbari kii apni "tifinag" naam kii pracheen aksharmala he jisaki sabase puraani likhaai 200 ipu se mili he
 After the Arabic invasion and occupation of barbaric areas, its use almost ceased, although it continued to be used by the Tuarag-speakers living in the deep desert
 bahut se barbar log barbari chhodkar arabi bolne lage or jo barbari likhte-bolte bhi the unamem arabi varnmaala kaa istemaal aam ho gaya
 Apart from the Tuarg areas, the use of Arabic characters in barbaric areas was prevalent from 1000 AD to 1500 AD
 19ve or 20ve sadi main europian samavaad ke saath -saath barbari kaa roman lipi main likhnaa shuru ho gaya
 This "barbaric Latin alphabet" became widely used in Morocco and Algeria, especially for writing tribal barbarians
 2003 main morocco ne, barbar swabhimaan ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, aupchaarik rup se tifinag lipi ke ek aadhunik rup ko sarkari manyata de di lekin abhi bhi kabaili barbar lekhak barbar latin lipi kaa hi zyaada prayog karte hai
 In contrast, Mali and Niger with Turang populations recognized the barbaric Latin script although Tifinag is more prevalent there
 angrezi main sangyaaon kaa ling nahin hota, jabaki hindi main sangyaayen streeling yaa pulling hoti hai 
 Berbari is like Hindi in this case
 pulling sangyaayen 'a / aa', 'u / uu' yaa 'i / i' se shuru hoti hai - There are three methods to make a noun plural - which method is used depends on the noun
 tulana ke liye, hindi main bhi teen tareeqen hai - 'juuta' kaa bahuvachan 'juute', 'makkhi' kaa 'makkhiyaan' or 'fal' kaa 'fal' hi hota he
 The 'normal method' is applied to some nouns of Berbri in which the first vowel of the word is changed to 'n' at the end - kuch sangyaaon par 'tuuti vidhi' lagu hoti he jisamen bahuvachan banane ke liye keval ekvachan shabd ke swaron main pher-badal kiya jaataa he - The third method is the mixed method, which is a mixture of the first two methods - kisi sangya kaa streeling banane ke liye ekvachan main uske pulling rup ke ird-gird 't' laga diya jaataa he or bahuvachan main keval uske shuru main hi 't' laga diya jaataa he - Note that the pronunciation of the letter 'G' used in the words "taimizigt", "tiffinag" and many other Berberies is different from "c"
 yah 'ghazal' ke 'ga' jaisaa he 
 Similarly, the pronunciation of 'kh' is also different from 'kh'
 paak sarazamin pakistan kaa raashtragan he
 It is called "qaumi Tarana" in Urdu
 ise hafeez jalandhri ne likhaa tha or iskaa sangeet akbar mohammad ne banaaya

 paak sarazamin main saamaanya urdu ke muqaabale farsi shabdon par adhik jor he
 On 14 August 1947, India split and Pakistan was born in a new country in the east and west
 pakistan ke kaayade aazam mohammad ali jinnah kaa sapana saakaar hua
 With the formation of a new country, the work of choosing different symbols and symbols for the country also started
 desh kaa jhanda pehle hi taiyaar ho chukaa tha, lekin raashtra-geet nahi bana tha
 At the time of independence, Pakistan had no national anthem
 isliye jab bhi dhvaj vandan hota " pakistan jindabad, azaadi pindabad" ke naare lagate the
 Jinnah did not accept this
 ve chaahate the ki pakistan ke raashtra-geet ko rachane kaa kaam sheeghra hi puraa karnaa chahie
 His advice cars suggested him the names of many famous Urdu poets who could have composed the song
 lekin jinnah kii soch kuch ore hi thi
 He felt that this is a good chance to establish the secular image of Pakistan before the world
 isliye unhone lahore ke mahanaurdu shaayar or mul hindu jagannatha azaad ko kaha ki "main aapako paanch din kaa hi samay de saktaa hu, aap pakistan ke liye raashtra-geet likhen"
 Jagannath Azad was also surprised and happy
 lekin pakistan ke kattarpanthi netaa isse bahut naaraaz hue ki ek hindu pakistan kaa raashtra-geet likhegaa
 But they were helpless before Jinnah's wish
 akhirkaar jagannatha azaad ne paanch dinon ke andar raashtra-geet taiyaar kar liya jo jinnah ko bahut pasand aayaa
 The lyrics were - i sarazami e pakjarre tere hai ajasitaro se tabanakaroshan he kehkashan se kahinaj teri khaak Jinnah recognized it as a national song and the song remained a national song till his death
 lekin is geet kii sweekruti ke mahaz 18 maheene baad hi jinnah kaa dehanth ho gaya or unke saath hi raashtra-geet kii manyata bhi khatm kar di gai
 Jagannath Azad later moved to India
 jinnah kii mrityu ke baad pakistan sarkaar ne ek raashtra-geet cameti banaai
 And asked for song samples from well-known poets
 lekin koi bhi geet raashtra-geet ke laayak nahi ban paa rahaa tha
 Finally, the government of Pakistan recognized the tune composed by Ahmed Chagla in 1950 as a national tune
 usee samay iran ke shah pakistan kii yatra par aae or unhone dhun ko kaaphi pasand kiya
 This tune seemed more westernized, but the rashtra-geet Committee believed that its form would be more accepted in Western society
 san 1954 main urdu shaayar haafiz jalandhri ne is dhun ke aadhaar par ek geet kii rachana kii
 The song was liked by the members of the rashtra-geet Committee
 or aakhirkaar haafiz jalandhri kaa likhaa geet pakistan kaa raashtra-geet bana

 They had negligible facilities compared to modern Xprusams, there were no pads, often they were tightened with a head
 His impedance was variable; The headphone used in telegraph and telephone work had an impedance of 75 ohms
 The headphones used with early wireless radios were more sensitive and were made with more twisted wires; Their impedance typically ranged from 1,000 to 2,000 ohms, suited for both crystal and triode receivers

 Earbuds or earphones are very small sized headphones that are placed directly into the outer ear canal, but are completely covered without it
 They are usually cheap and are preferred for their portability and convenience
 Due to the inability to provide isolation, its intensity is often increased to beat noise from around the user, increasing the risk of hearing loss
 During the 1990s and 2000s, earbuds became common with personal musical equipment

 a headset is a headphone connected with a microphone
 Headsets provide the functionality of telephone handsets with hands-free operation
 The most common use of headsets is in console or PC gaming, call centers, and other telephone-related jobs, and for personal use on computers to facilitate conversations and typing
 Headsets are made up of either a single earpiece or a double-earpiece
 The microphone branches of headsets are either external microphones, with the microphone facing the user's mouth, or as a voicetube with a microphone earpiece and the conversation reaches through a hollow tube

 In older models of telephones, the headset microphone is different from the original handset resistor, the telephone headset requires an amplifier
 a telephone amplifier provides basic pin-alignment like a telephone headset adapter, but also amplifies the sound for loudspeakers as well as microphones
 Most models of telephone amplifiers feature microphone, mute, and intensity control for loudspeakers with headset / handset switching
 Telephone amplifiers are powered by batteries or AC adapters
 headphone transdusar kaa lagaaya janaa dhwani ke punarutpaadan karne ke vibhinn tareekon main se ek he
 The moving-coil driver, more commonly known as the "dynamic" driver, is used in most common types of headphones
 Its operating principle consists of a static magnetic element affixed to the frame of the headphones, which creates a strong static magnetic field
 The magnetic element in headphones is usually made up of ferrite and neodymium
 The diaphragm, usually lightly attached to the radio cellulose amount, polymer, carbon material or similar, but very tightly coupled to the coil of the wire, is the static magnetic field of the reinforced magnet
 
 When the audio current passes through the coil, the diaphragm connected by the voice coil is activated
 The alternating magnetic field reacts electrically against the static magnetic field on the other side through the coil, The coil and its attached diaphragm move the air, creating a sound
 The modern moving-coil headphone driver has emerged from microphone capsule technology

 Being very thin and light, the diaphragm curtain, which is often only a few micrometers thick, and the rotating metalwork is completely absent, the frequency response of stationary electrical headphones usually extends so well that the range of hearing Exceeds 20 khz
 The high frequency response means that the low midband distortion level maintains the top of the listenable frequency band, usually in no-scope coil chambers
 In addition, the frequency response is regularly observed at the peak in the high frequency region with the absence of moving coil conductors
 If properly designed, the resulting sound quality will be much better

 Like electrostatics, an electret driver also works through the same electro-mechanics
 Although electret drivers are manufactured by permanently charging, electrostatics have a conductor used by an external generator
 Electrostatics such as electrosthetics are relatively uncommon
 They are also generally cheaper and have lower technical capability and reliability than electrostatics

 The design is not mechanically durable, allowing a slight imbalance armature to stick to one pole of the magnet
 To hold the armature in a balanced position requires a very tight alternating force
 Although it reduces its efficiency, this design can produce excessive sound in low power compared to others
 As the Bladwin Mica diaphragm radio headphones became popular in the 1920s, balanced armature transducers were redefined to use 'sound-powered' telephones in the military during World War II
 Some of these achieved astonishing electrical sound conversion efficiencies in the range of 20% to 40% for narrow bandwidth voice signals

 Heil Air Motion Transformer for headphones), piezoelectric film; Ribbon Planar Magnetic; Transducer technology, including magnetostriction and plasma-ionisation, is less common to be employed
 The first Heil AMT headphones were marketed by ESS Laboratories and essentially included an ESS AMT tweeter to prevent a company's speakers from running across the range
 By the turn of the century, only the Presid of Switzerland manufactured AMT headphones
 Piezoelectric film headphones were first developed by Pioneer, with two models, each using flat sheet film, limiting the maximum amount of air that could flow
 At present, techt produces a piezoelectric film headphones, which do not have the same size as AMT transducers, But for its headphones it uses the preside as a driver, which varies in size to the transducer layers of the diaphragm
 In addition, it incorporates a two-way design, through this inclusion it is dedicated to the tweeter / supertwitter panel
 The fold-shaped diaphragm with a large surface area allows the transducer to fit into a small enclosed space
 This increases the total amount of air, so that it can flow through a given area of the transducer into a dilated area

 Headphones are used so that no one else can listen, due to which privacy or hassle may be avoided, such as the use of headphones to listen in a public library
 They can provide far more reliability to the sound level than a similarly priced loudspeaker
 The ability to do this comes when the display room is redesigned with headphones to meet the shortage of what is required for it
 High quality headphones may have a fairly flat response in 3db below 20 Hz in slow frequency
 However, the type of sound reproduced at that fixed frequency does not provide a response to the distorted form of the fixed door frequency
 Market claims of 4 Hz to 20 khz are generally exaggerated; The response frequency of the product is normally much lower than 20 Hz

 Although modern headphones are particularly widely sold and have been used to listen to stereo recordings since the arrival of the Walkman, there is a subjective debate about the form of reproduction of stereo sound
 Stereo recording refers to the question of the difference of sound intensity between two channels through the position of the horizontal depth of the signal
 When there is a mixture of sounds emanating from two speakers, they create a phase difference, which the brain uses to find direction
 Through most headphones, the illusion of the center of the shadow can be felt as soon as it is lost, as the right and left channels do not interconnect in this way
 Only shrill sounds will be heard with only one ear instead of one side
 This latter is especially important for older stereo recordings that were less sophisticated, binoral recording ek dami head kaa upyog karte hue sankethik nirdesh ko bahut hi kam aiami antar se adhik ke sivaay) se sidhe ek charan ke rup badalane ke liye ek bhinn tarah ke microphone takanic istemaal karte hai or headphone ke jariye jeevant sthanik prabhaav paidaa kar sakate hai

 Using headphones at sufficient intensity levels may cause temporary or permanent hearing loss or deafness due to an effect called "occultation"
 The intensity of the headphones has to be equal to the background noise, especially in highly noisy places like underground stations, airplanes and congestion
 Common pain associated with high levels of intensity disappears
 Excessive intensity may be harmful for extended periods; However, a hearing ability expert found that "less than 5% of the users often choose the level of intensity they listen to is damaging to their ability to hear
" Some manufacturers of portable music devices are attempting to introduce a protective circuit system that limits intensity outputs or warns when the user is using a dangerous intensity, but this concept was rejected by most buyers, Those who favor their choice for high intensity
 Koss started the cassette range in 1983 with the name "safelight", which had such a warning light
 This line was closed after two years due to lack of interest

 Canalphones and in-ear monitors are rarely described as causing hearing loss in noisy environments, as the noise-isolating material in the in-ear seal naturally blocks a large portion of the outside noise
 It does
 This enables the user to hear at low intensity levels
 However, users can still choose to listen at a dangerously high level

 Motorcycle and power-sports riders legally use foam earplugs to avoid extra roadways, engines and wind noise, etc
, but they benefit from this, but they do so by listening to music and intercom conversations
 Efficiency actually increases
 Normally the ear can detect one billionth of the sound pressure level of the atmosphere, so it is incredibly sensitive
 At very high sound pressure levels, the ear muscles tighten the tympanic membrane and cause a small change in the geometry of the bone and stirrup, which reduces the transfer force of the oval groove of the inner ear
 is
 Since earplugs reduce noise in the auditory canal, it is less likely to trigger a protective mechanism and the ear's sensitivity remains fully intact
 With general sensitivity, When a listener listens to a helmet speaker through earplugs, his hearing capacity is excellent
 This technique maintains hearing, music, and mostly external sound at a sustainable level without impairing hearing

 If the air is too strong, it makes the water agitated and eroded for rippling
 lahar ke peeche or uske neeche ke samudri farsh kaa bhi lahar par gaharaa asar padataa he
 If there is a reef in the water, it changes the shape of the waves
 aadhunik takneekon se farsh or hawa ko mapa ja saktaa he or aage lehren kaise hone vaali hai iskaa andaaza lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The wavelers get these predictions through radio, newspapers and internet before going to the coast
 mausam or sthaan ke anusaar mahaatarangon kaa niyam badalata rahata he
 In winter, when the northern and southern polar façade moves towards the equator, dense swells occur in the mid-latitudes
 purv kii ore chalati shaktishaalee pashchimi hawaaon kii vajah se deshon ke pashchimi taton par sabase unchi lehren sardiyon main dekhi jaati hai
 But the cyclones occurring at mid-latitudes push these swells towards the tropics periodically
 up-ooshnakaribandheey ilaaqon ke purvi taton par bhi kabhi-kabhi kam dabaav ke kshetra ban jate hai kyonki vahaan zyaada dabaav vaali hawaayen kabhi-kabhi kam gati par pahunch paati he
 From this, the high swells are seen here on the eastern coasts
 garmiyon main, ushn kshetra main chakravaaton se baari mahaatarange paidaa hoti hai
 These cyclones originate in the warm sea, which is why El Niño and La Niña are affected by the cycle

 The waveleaders represent a diverse culture based on the waveform
 kuch log laharbaazi kaa abhyaas shaukia gatividhi ke rup main karte hai, jabaki anya ise apane jivan kaa kendriya vishay maanate hai
 The waveform culture is most influential in the states of California, Florida and Hawaii in the United States
 is se sambandhit chizon main 'woodi' shaamil he - yah ek lambi stationwagon gaadi hoti he jisapar lahartate ladakar le jaae jate hai
 Waves also like to wear a long neckerchief named 'broadshorts'
 laharbaazi sambandhit maal kii bikri main har saal ab dasiyon arabon dollars kaa maal karidaa-bechaa jaataa he
 Even non-wagering people use its mark to relate to this game
 laharbaaz ek-dusre ko teen shreniyon main vargeekrut karte hai: Many new words have also been generated by the interaction of waveleaders: kuch laharbaaz is khel main itane duube hue the ki unhen anukool laharon ki sthiti na hone par bhi is se miltaa kuch karnaa tha
 In this attempt, he started 'footpath waving' by putting wheels under the boards
 ise ab 'sketbording' kaha jaataa he
 Later on, it was also played on the placards above the snow on the hills and the game got its name 'snowboarding'
 lahar par sawari karne ke liye laharbaaz apane lahartate par let ke tat se samudr main nikal jaataa he
 He floats his hands into the hull and floats out into the sea

 In this game of waving, the tube ride is a demonstration of tact or skill
 jab koi lahar tootna shuru hoti he, to jaise hi rail ke tile yaa chattan ke neeche utarati he yah aksar ek khokhli dhara kaa nirmaan karti he, jo ek anbhavi laharbaaz ko lahar ke khokhla bhaag main khud ko sthit karne main sakasham karti he, ise tub bhi kaha jaataa he
 The waveform may be completely surrounded by water for several seconds; That is, until the wave forces it to exit the tube and back away from the open mouth of the wave
 Waves often fall off the surfboard by not cleaning the tube cleanly due to degree of difficulty while riding in the tube
 tub sawari kaa pakkaa kaushal sirf khokhli laharon kii varshon kii sawari ke anubhav se hi praapt ho saktaa he or iske liye yah anumaan lagaana siikhnaa bhi jaruri he kii lehren kaise tootengi, is prakaar aap tub ke andar adhik samay rahane main sakasham ho sakenge, yaa aap par laharon ke tut padane se pehle vahaan se nikalne main sakasham ho sakenge

 The Hanging Five has only one leg close to the front, with the toes resting at the ends
 praarambhik california laharbaazi taton se james carman dwaara pehali baar hanging ten prasiddh hua
 Cutback: creating motion in a row and then turning in the opposite direction
 This has the effect of slowing the rider to keep pace with the slow wave current after a strong wave, for example jumping
 flotor: lahar ke sheersh par sawari karnaa or phir vahaan se neeche utar aana
 lahar dhara jab samaapt hone lagati he tab iskaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Very easy and popular in short waves

 An emerging board material is epoxy, which is stronger and lighter than traditional fiberglass
 yahaan tak ki nayi diginon main bhi carbon fibre or parivarti-lacheele yogicon jaisi samagriyon ko shaamil kiya ja rahaa he
 Since epoxy surfboards are lightweight, they can float far better than fiber glass boards of the same size, shape and thickness
 isse inhen pani main tej chalaane main aasaani hoti he
 However, a common complaint about EPS boards is that they do not provide as much feedback as a traditional fiber glass board
 For this reason, many vanguard surfers prefer surfboards made of fiber glass

 pani ke sabhi khelon kii tarah laharbaazi main bhi dub kar marane kaa khatra antarnihit he
 Although the board is helpful in flowing, but since it is separate from the user, it cannot be relied upon to float overhead
 ek patta, jo takhne yaa ghutane se bandhaa hota he, laharbaaz ko board se suvidha ke liye jode rakhata he, lekin laharbaaz ko doobane se bachaa nahin saktaa
 sthapit niyam yah he ki agar laharbaaz bagaiyr apane board ke pani kii sthiti ko sambhaal nahin saktaa yaa sakati he to use dur nahin janaa chahie
 Some incidents of drowning have occurred as a result of being entangled with the rock strap caught by the underwater wave
