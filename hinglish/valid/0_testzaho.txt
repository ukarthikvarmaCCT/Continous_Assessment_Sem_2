 He pledged to bring the Ganges to Earth so that the cremation could take place, the ashes could flow into the Ganges water and the wandering souls could go to heaven
 bhageerath ne brahma kii ghor tapasya kii taaki ganga ko prithvi par laayaa ja sake
 Brahma was pleased and agreed to send Ganga to Earth and ordered Ganga to go to Earth and then to Hades so that the souls of the sons of Sagara could be liberated
 tab ganga ne kaha ki main itani oonchaai se jab prithvi par avatarit houngi to prithvi itnaa veg kaise sah paaegi? tatpashchaat bhageerath ne bhagwaan shiv se nivedan kiya or unhone apni khuli jataaon main ganga ke veg ko rokkar, ek lat khol di, jisase ganga kii aviral dhara prithvi par pravaahit hui
 The stream followed Bhagirath to the ganges-sagar confluence, where the sons and sons were saved

 The nation-river Ganges of India flows not only water, but also human consciousness of India and Hindi literature
 rugveda, mahabharat, ramayana evam anek puraanon main ganga ko punya salila, paap-nashini, moksh pradaayini, saritshreshtha evam mahanadi kaha gaya he
 Sanskrit poet Jagannath Rai has composed a poem called 'srigangalhari' in praise of Ganga
 hindi ke aadi mahakavy prithviraj raso tathaa visaldev raas main ganga kaa ullekh he
 The most famous folk text of Adikal is mentioned in Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati in Alhkhand, composed by Jagnik
 kavi ne prayagraj kii is triveni ko paapnaashak batalaaya he
 Ganga is also mentioned in shringar-ras's poets Vidyapati, Kabir Vani and Jayasi's Padmavat, but Surdas and Tulsidas describe the ganga-mahatmya in great detail in devotional spirit
 goswami tulsidas ne kavitawali ke uttarkand main ‘shri ganga mahatmaya’ kaa varnan teen chhandon main kiya he— in chhandon main kavi ne ganga darshan, ganga snaan, ganga jal seven, ganga tat par basane waalon ke mahatva ko varnit kiya he
 The Ganga description of Senapati and Padmakar in Reetikal is noteworthy
 padmakar ne ganga kii mahima or kirti kaa varnan karne ke liye gangalahari naamak granth kii rachana kii he
 Describing the Ganges greatness in Senapati Kavitta Ratnakar, he says that Ganga's virtuous stream is embellished to destroy the boat of sin
 raskhaan, rahim aadi ne bhi ganga prabhaav kaa sundar varnan kiya he
 Among modern-day poets, in the book Gangavataran of Jagannathdas Ratnakar, there is a story of Bhagiratha's 'bhagiratha-penance' descending from the Ganges to the land for the salvation of sixty thousand sons of the cursed by Kapil Muni
 sampoorn granth teraa sargon main vibhakt or rola chand main nibaddh he
 Other poets Bharatendu Harishchandra, Sumitranandan Pant and Sridhar Pathak etc
 have also described the yatra-tatra Ganga

 Sumitranandan Pant's picture of the summer Tapas Bala Ganga in 'boating' is very delightful
 unhone ganga naamak kavita bhi likhi he

 yah film yash chopra dwaara banaai gai ek prem kahani he
 It shows the love between Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh in the Indian Air Force and Zara Hayat Khan of Pakistan
 film main donon kii mulaaqaat tab hoti he jab zaaraa, jo pakistan se apni bebe kii asthiyaan kiratpur sahib main bahaane ai hoti hai, kii bas pahaado main fas jaati he or unhen bachaane ke liye bhartiya vaayu sena se vir aate hai
 After this, Veer takes Zara to show his village and falls in love with Zara there
 gaanv main vir zaaraa ko apane bouji or maati se bhi milwate hai
 Zara stops one day in Veer's village
 zaaraa vir ko ye nahin bataati ki unki mangani raza shiraji se ho chuki he
 When Veer leaves Zara at the station, Raza meets him there and he comes to know about this
 wo raza ke saamne zaaraa se apni muhabbat kaa izhaar karte hai or zaaraa raza ke saath vaapis pakistan chali jaati hai
 After some time Veer gets a call from Shabo from Zara's house and he resigns from the Air Force and goes to Pakistan
 lahore main zaaraa ke pita ko vir ke achaanak aane se or zaaraa ke vir se milane se dil kaa daura pad jaataa he
 He then meets Zara and explains to them that they must marry
 zaaraa shaadi ke liye haanmi bhar detii hai, par raza vir ko bharat ke research and enelysis wing kaa agent hone ke jhuthe ilzaam main pakistan main jail bhijwa dete hai
 Many years later, Samaya takes Siddiqui's case to Veer and Veer tells her the whole story
 samaya bharat jaati hai vir ke gaanv se subut laane or vahaan unhen zaaraa milti hai, jo kai saal se shabbo ke saath vahiin rah rahi hoti hai
 There are reports of the bus in which Veer was going to fall from that mountain and both know that Veer has died
 samaya unhen sachai bataati hai or ve samaya ke saath subut lekar pakistan jaati hai
 Veer wins the case and Veer and Zara live in Veer's village

 Archimedes is generally regarded as the greatest mathematician of ancient times and one of the greatest of all time
 unhone ek paravalay ke chaap ke neeche ke kshetrafal kii gananaa karne ke liye purnataa kii vidhi kaa upyog kiya, iske liye unhone aparimit shrinkhalaa ke sameshan kaa upyog kiya or pai kaa ullekhneey sateek sannikat maan diya
 He also defined an Archimedes spiral, which is based on his name, gave formulas for the volume of the rotating surface and also gave a simple system for expressing very large numbers
 archimedes seracus kii gheraabandi ke dauraan maare gaye jab ek roman sainik ne unki hatya kar di, haalanki yah aadesh diya gaya tha ki unhen koi nuksaan nahin pahunchnaa chahie
 Describing the tomb of Cicero Archimedes, which is like a dome inside a cylinder, Archimedes proved that the volume of the sphere and its surface area is two-thirds of the cylinder and it is one of his greatest Is considered a mathematical achievement

 Some copies of Archimedes's written work that remained until the Middle Ages were the major source of ideas for scientists during the Renaissance, although the previously unknown work by Archimedes was discovered in Archimedes Palimpset in 1906, which led to this Gave the subject a new insight into how they achieved mathematical results

 duusare punik yuddh ke dauraan hui jab roman senaaon ne general marcus cloudius marcelas ke netritv main do saal kii gheraabandi ke baad seracus shahar par kabza kar liya
 According to the popular description given by Plutarch, Archimedes was considering a mathematical figure when the city was captured
 ek roman sainik ne unhen aakar general marcelas se milane kaa aadesh diya, lekin unhone yah kahkar inkaar kar diya ki unhen apni samasya par kaam puraa karnaa he
 This angered the soldier and killed Archimedes with his sword
 plutark archimedes kii mrityu kaa bhi ek vivaran dete hai lesser-known jisamen yah kaha gaya he ki sambhavatya unhen tab maar diya gaya jab ve ek roman sainik ko samarpan karne kaa prayaas kar rahe the
 According to this story, Archimedes was carrying a mathematical device and was killed because the soldier thought it was valuable
 kaha jaataa he ki archimedes kii mrityu se general marcelas bahut krodhit hue, kyonki ve unhen ek amuly vaigyanik sampati maanate the or unhone aadesh die the ki archimedes ko kisi bhi prakaar kaa nuksaan nahin pahunchaaya janaa chahie
 Archimedes' last words were believed to be, "do not disturb my circles", the accounts here refer to the circles of the mathematical picture that Archimedes was studying when the Roman soldier harassed him
 in shabdon ko aksar latin main "noli turbare circulos meos" ke rup main varnit kiya jaataa he, lekin is baat ke koi bharosemand pramaan nahin hai ki archimedis ne ye shabd kahe the or ye plutark ke dwaara die gaye vivaran main nahin milte hai

 75 BC In, 137 years after his death, the Roman orator Cicero was serving as treasurer in Sicily
 unhone archimedes ke makbare ke bare main kahaniyaan suni thim, lekin sthaneey logon main se koi bhi isaki sthiti bataane main sakasham nahin tha
 He eventually discovered this mausoleum near the Agrigentine Gate in Syracuse, it was in a very neglected condition and there were many shrubs growing on it
 siciro ne makbare ko saafe kiya or iske upar hui nakkashi ko dekh paae or us par shilaalekh ke rup main upasthit kuch chhandon ko padhaa
 Standard versions of Archimedes's life were written by historians of ancient Rome long after his death
 polibyas ke dwaara diya gaya seracus kii gheraabandi kaa vivaran unki universal history main archimedes kii mrityu ke lagbhag 70 varsh ke baad likhaa gaya or ise baad main plutark or livi ke dwaara ek strot ke rup main prayukt kiya gaya
 It sheds little light on Archimedes as an individual and focuses on the war machines he is believed to have built to protect the city
 archimedes ke bare main sabase vyapak rup se gyaat tathy yah bataata he ki kis prakaar se unhone ek aniyamit akruti ke ek vastu ke aaytan ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye vidhi kii khoj kii
 According to Vitruvius, a new crown of a laurel wreath was made for King Hero II and Archimedes was asked to find out whether the crown was made of pure gold or that the unscrupulous goldsmith had added silver to it
 archimedes ko mukut ko nuksaan pahunchaae bina is samasya kaa samaadhaan karnaa tha, isliye vah iske ghanatv kii gananaa karne ke liye ise pighla kar ek niyamit aakaar kii vastu main nahin badal saktaa tha
 While taking a bath, he noticed that when he went inside the tub, the water level in the tub rose and he realized that this effect could be used to determine the volume of the crown
 vyavhaarik prayojanon ke liye pani ko sampidit nahin kiya ja saktaa he, isliye duba hua mukut apane aaytan kii baraabar maatra ke pani ko pratisthapit karegaa
 The density of the crown can be obtained by dividing the weight of the crown by the volume of water replaced
 yadi isamen saste or kam ghanatv vaale dhaatu milaaye gaye hai to iskaa ghanatv sone se kam hoga
 What was then, Archimedes became so excited by his discovery that he forgot to wear clothes and ran in the streets in a naked state shouting "eureka!" sone ke mukut kii kahani archimedes ke gyaat kaaryon main prakat nahin hoti he
 Furthermore, due to the excessive amount of accuracy required in the measurement of water displacement, the feasibility of the method described by it has been questioned
 sambhavat: archimedes ne ek aisa hal diya jo jalsthitiki main archimedes ke siddhant naamak siddhant par lagu hota he, jise ve apane ek granth on floating bodis main varnit karte hai
 According to this theory, an object immersed in a liquid exerts a buoyancy force that is equal to the weight of the liquid it removes
 is siddhant kaa prayog karte hue, sone ke mukut ke ghanatv kii tulana thos sone se karnaa sambhav ho gaya hoga, iske liye pehle mukut ko sone ke ek namoonay ke saath ek paimaane par santulit kiya gaya hoga, phir tantra ko pani main dubaaya gaya hoga
 If the crown was less dense than gold, it would have replaced more water due to its greater volume and thus the buoyancy force applied to it would have been greater than the sample
 utplavakta main yah antar paimaane par dikhaayi diya hoga
 Galileo considered that "archimedes may have used this method, since, to be very precise, it is based on the performance given by Archimedes himself
" " a large part of the work by Archimedes in the field of engineering came from meeting the needs of his own city of Syracuse
 unani lekhak naukratis ke athenus ne varnit kiya ki kaise raja hiron II ne archimedes ko ek vishaal jahaaj, syracusia dizin karne ke liye kaha, jise vilasitapurna yatra karne ke liye, saamaan kii supplai karne ke liye or nausena ke yudhpot ke rup main prayukt kiya ja sake
 Siracusia is believed to have been the largest ship in ancient times
 athenus ke anusaar, yah 600 logon ko le jane main sakasham tha, saath hi isaki suvidhaon main ek bageeche kii sajaavat, ek vyaayaamashaala or devi effordit ko samarpit ek mandir bhi tha
 Since a ship of this size would leak a large amount of water through the hull, Archimedes' screw was made to remove this water
 archimiddiz kii mashin ek ek upkaran thi, jisamen ek belan ke bheetar ghurnan karte hue scru ke aakaar ke blade the
 It was rotated by hand and could also be used to transfer water from a low-lying body of water to an irrigation canal
 archimedes ke scru kaa upyog aaj bhi drav or kaneey thos jaise koyala or anaaj ko pump karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Archimedes' screw described by Vitruvius in Roman times was probably an improvement on the screw pump that was used to irrigate the hanging gardens of the Babylonians
 archimedes kaa panja ek hathiyaar he, mana jaataa he ki unhone seracus shahar kii raksha ke liye ise dizin kiya tha
 Also known as "the Ship Shaker", this claw had a crane-like arm from which a large metal hook hung
 jab is panje ko ek akraman karte hue jahaaj par daalaa jaataa tha, bhujaa upar kii ore uthati thi or jahaaj ko ko uthaakar pani se baahar nikaalati thi or sambhawatah ise duba detii thi
 Modern tests have been conducted to investigate the feasibility of this claw, and in 2005 a television documentary titled Super Weapons of the Ancient World created a version of this claw and concluded that it was a working device

 Centuries later Anthemias of Trelage referred to the burning glass as Archimedes' weapon
 yah upkaran, kabhi kabhi "archimedes ki ushma kiran" kehalaata he, iskaa upyog lakshya jahaaj par surya ke prakaash ko focus karne ke liye kiya jaataa tha, jisase ve aag lakad lete the
 This alleged weapon has been the subject of debate since the Renaissance

 It has been suggested that a large group of layers of heavily polished bronze or copper serve as mirrors, presumably which were used to focus sunlight onto the ship
 isamen paravalay paravarti ke siddhant kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha, jaise saura bhatti main kiya jaataa he
 a trial of Archimedes heat ray was carried out in 1973 by the Greek scientist Lonis Sakkas
 yah prayog athens ke baahar skaramjes nausena base par kiya gaya
 At this time 70 mirrors were used, each was polished with a copper and its size was about 5x3 feet
 The mirrors were placed in the direction of a plywood mock-up of a Roman warship about 160 feet away
 jab darpanon ko thik prakaar se focus kiya gaya, jahaaj kuch hi kshanon main aag kii lapaton main jalane laga
 The plywood was polished with tar paint on the ship, which further contributed to the combustion

 Flames erupted at one place on the ship, but only when there were no clouds in the sky and the ship remained in the same position for about ten minutes
 yah nishkarsh niklaa gaya ki yah upkaran in paristhitiyon main ek vyavhaarya hathiyaar tha
 The MIT group repeated the experiment for the television show Mythbusters, using a wooden fishing boat in San Francisco as the target
 ek baar phir se aisa hi hua, kam maatra main aag lag gayi
 To catch fire, the wood has to reach its ignition point, which is about 300 ° C

 It was also pointed out that because Syracuse is facing the sun to the east, the Roman fleet would have to attack in the morning to collect favorable light from the mirrors
 mithbsters ne yah bhi kaha ki paaramparik hathiyaar, jaise jwalanth tir yaa ek gulel se bheje gaye tir, kam duuri se jahaaj ko jalane kaa adhik aasaan tarika he
 While Archimedes did not discover the lever, he first gave a rigorous description of the theory involved
 alegsendriya ke pappas ke anusaar, livers par unke kaary se unhone tippanee di: "mujhe khadey hone kii jagah do or main prithvi ko gati de duungaa
" plutark ne is baat kaa varnan kiya ki kaise archimedes ne block-or-tekal ghirani pranali ko dizin kiya, jisase aisi vastuon ko uthaane main navikon ne liverej kaa siddant istemaal kiya, jo itani baari thim ki unhen anyathaa hilaanaa bhi bahut mushkil hota tha
 Archimedes has also been credited with improving the ability and accuracy of the catapult and invented the odometer during the First Punic War
 odometer ko ek gear se yukt ek gaadi kii pranali ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he, jo har ek mile chalane ke baad ek gend ko ek paatr main daalati he
 Cicero briefly mentions Archimedes in his Dialogue de Rey Publica, in 129 BC after the siege of Syracuse
 a fictional conversation depicted in, c
 212 BC, General Marcus Claudius Marcellus is said to have brought back two systems in Rome, which were used to aid astronomy, the Sun, Moon and the Five Shows the motion of the planets
 siciro usee tarah kii pranali kaa ullekh karte hai jaisi pranali militus ke thels or needs ke yudoxs ke dwaara dizin kii gayi
 According to this dialogue, Marcellus kept one device as his personal loot from Syracuse and donated all the others to the Temple of Virtue in Rome
 siciro ke anusaar marcelas kii pranali ko geiyas salpikas gelis ke dwaara lukias furias philis ko darshaya gaya, jisane ise is prakaar se varnit kiya: It is a description of a planetarium or Orei)
 alegsendriya ke pappas ne kaha ki archimedes ne in nirdisht pranaaliyon ke nirmaan par ek pandulipi likhi he On sphere-making
 Modern studies in this area focus on the antikythera system, another device from ancient times that was probably designed for a similar purpose
 is prakaar kii nirmaanatmak pranali ke liye avakal gearing ke parishkrut gyaan kii aavashyaktaa rahi hogi
 It was once thought to be outside the range of technology available in ancient times, but the discovery of the Antikythera system in 1902 ensured that such devices were known to the ancient Greeks
 haalanki archimedes ko aksar yantric upkarnon kaa diziner kaha jaataa he, unhone ganit ke kshetra main bhi yogadan diya
 Plutarch wrote: "he put all his affection and ambition in those pure details where there can be no reference to the uncivil needs of life
" archimedes aparimit shrinkhalaaon kaa upyog usee tareeke se kar sakate the jaise ki aadhunik samakal kalan main kiya jaataa he
 Through proof by contradiction, they could solve a problem up to a random fraction of accuracy, specifying the limits in which the answer occurred
 yah takanic purnataa kii vidhi kehalaati he or unhone iskaa prayog pai ) ke sannikat maan kaa pataa lagane main kiya
 For this he painted a large polygon outside a vow and a small polygon inside the vow
 jaise jaise bahubhuj kii bhujaaon kii sankhya badhati he, vrath kaa sanniktan adhik sateek ho jaataa he
 When each polygon had 96 sides, they calculated the lengths of their sides and showed that the value of π was between 31⁄7 and 310⁄71, corresponding to its true value of about 3
1416
 unhone yah bhi pramanit kiya ki vraton kaa kshetrafal π or vrath kii trigya ke varg ke gunanfal ke baraabar tha
 In measuring a vow, Archimedes states the square root value of 3 to be greater than 265⁄153 and less than 1351⁄780
 vaastavik maan lagbhag 1
7320508 he jo bahut hi sateek anumaan he
 He did not give any explanation of the method used to achieve it, giving this result
 archimedes ke kaary ke is pahalu ke kaaran jon walis ne tippanee di ki ve :"jaanboojh kar apni jaanch ko chupaana chaahate the jaise ki ve apni jaanch kii vidhi ko rahasy bana kar rakhana chaahate the, jabaki iske parinaamon ko sabase saamne laana chaahate the
 " paravalay ke varg kii gananaa main, archimedes ne sabit kiya ki ek paravalay or ek sidhi rekha se ghira hua kshetrafal iske bheetar upasthit tribhuj ke kshetrafal kaa 4⁄3 guna hota he, jaisaa ki daayin or die gaye chitra main darshaya gaya he
 He expressed the solution to this problem as an infinite geometric series with common proportions1⁄4: yadi is shrinkhalaa main pehla pad tribhuj kaa kshetrafal he, to doosraa do tribhujon ke kshetrafal kaa yoga he, jinke aadhaar do choti chhedika rekhaaen hai or isi prakaar
 yah pramaan shrinkhalaa 1 / 4 + 1 / 16 + 1 / 64 + 1 / 256 + · · · kii bhinnata kaa upyog karata he, jiskaa yoga 1⁄3 he
 In The Sand Reconnor, Archimedes gave a set of numbers to calculate the number of soil particles present in this universe
 aisa karne main, unhone is dharna ko chunauti di ki mitti ke kanon kii sankhya itani badi he ki isaki gananaa nahin kii ja sakati he
 He wrote: "some people, King Gello, think that the number of soils is infinite in the infinite; and i believe that the soil is not only in Syracuse and the rest of Sicily, but in every region where there is housing or no housing

 The Reason for uttering three times is for calming and removing obstacles inthree realms which are: "physical" or adhibhautik, "divine" or subordinate and "internal" or aadhyatmik According to the scriptures of Hinduism sources of obstacles and troubles are in these three realms
 Physical or adhi-bhautika realm can be source of troubles / obstacles coming from external world, such as from wild animals, people, natural calamities etc
 Divine or adhi-daivika realm can be source of troubles / obstacles coming from extra-sensory world of spirits, ghosts, deities, demigods / angels etc
 Internal or Adhyaatmika realm is source of troubles / obstacles arising out of ones own body and mind, such as pain, diseases, laziness, absent-mindedness etc
 These are called "tapa-traya" or three classes of troubles
 When Shanti mantras are recited, obstacles from these realms are believed to bepacified

 chunki vibhinn paramparaon ko maananevaale isaiyon ke bich is baat ko lekar matbhed hai ki baptism ke liye purna rup se dubona aavashyak he yaa nahin, atah is greek shabd kaa upyukt arth charchaa ke liye mahatvapurn ban gaya he
 Liddell and Scott's greek-english dictionary gives the primary meaning of that word as "to dive, dive" (transliterated as βαπτίζω), from which the English word "baptized" is assumed, but Luke as an example
 11:38 indicates that another meaning of this is "ablution"
 haalanki greek shabd βαπτίζω kaa ekmaatr arth dubkee lagaana, ghota lagaana yaa dubona nahin he, lekin shabdic strot suchit karte hai ki septuajint or nayaa qaraar donon main yahi is shabd kaa saamaanya arth he
 a related term, βάπτω, has also been used in the New Testament to mean "dipping" or "coloring", the dip may be incomplete, such as dipping a piece of bread in wine
 nayaa qaraar ke do pariched yah suchit karte hai ki βαπτίζω shabd jab kisi vyakti par lagu kiya jaae, to yah sadaiv hi nimajjan ko suchit nahin karata tha
 The first of these is Luke 11:38, which describes how an impostor, in whose house Christ had eaten, "was stunned to see that he did not wash his hands before the meal
" This is the passage which Liddell and Scott cite as an example of the use of βαπτίζω in the sense of immersion
 isa messiah dwaara is kaarywahi kaa paalan na karnaa unke shishyon ke hi samaan he: "iske baad jerusalem ke dharm-shasri or pakhand log isa messiah ke paas yah kehete hue aae ki tere anuyaayi purvajon kii parampara kaa ulanghan kyon karte hai? kyonki ve nahin dhote apane haath, jab ve bhojan karte hai
 "the other passage of the New Testament referred to is:" showy people


 do not eat until they wash their hands completely, following the tradition of their ancestors; And when they return from the market, they do not eat until they have washed themselves completely "
 vibhinn sampradaayon ke vidwaanon kaa daawa he ki ye do pariched darshaate hai ki aamantrit kiye gayi atithiyon athwa bazaar se lautne vaale logon se swayan ko pani main puri tarah dubone kii ummid nahin kii jaani chaiye, balki keval apane haathon ko aanshik rup se pani main dubone yaa khud par jal chhidakane kii ummid kii jaani chaiye, jaisaa ki vartmaan yahudee paddati dwaara apanaaya gaya rup he
 The phonological work of Zodiets and Balz and Schneider also states that in the second of these cases, the term Mark 7: 4, βαπτίζω means that after coming from the market, the renegade people collected water only in their hands They drowned and they did not immerse themselves completely
 ve samajhate hai ki βαπτίζω shabd kaa arth βάπτω ke hi samaan, dubkee lagaana yaa nimajjan karnaa he, ek shabd jiskaa prayog haath main rakhe tukade ko sharaab main yaa ek anguli ko faile hue khun main aanshik rup se dubone ke arth main kiya jaataa he
 The New Testament derives two cognates derived from βαπτ:: βαπτισμός and βάπτισμα
 Mark 7:4 main Βαπτισμός thaaliyon kii shuddhi, dhulaai, prakshalan ke uddeshy se kiye jane vaale ek jal-sambandhi karm-kand ko sanderbhit karata he; usee shloke main tathaa Hebrews 9:10 main barttano ke athwa sharir ke levi prakshalan ko; tathaa Hebrews 6:2 main sambhawatah baptism ko bhi, haalanki sambhawatah vahaan yah kisi nirjeev padaarth ko dhone kaa ullekh kar saktaa he
 In Colossians 2:12, secondary manuscripts have βάπτισμα, but the best have βαπτισμός and the same meaning is given in modern critical editions of the New Testament
 yah nayaa qaraar kaa ekmaatr udhaaharan he, jisamen βαπτισμός kaa ullekh spasht rup se isai baptism ke arth main kiya gaya he, na ki saamaanya dhulaai ke arth main, lekin Hebrews 6:2 bhi baptism kaa ullekh kar saktaa he
 When it is simply referring to the ablution of instruments, βαπτισμός has been compared with ῥαντισμός, found only in Hebrews 12:24 and 1peter 1: 2, a term used by clergy of the Old Testament to denotate ablutions
 Used to inform
 Βάπτισμα, jise βαπτισμός samajhakar bhramit nahin hona chahie, keval isaiyon dwaara kiye gayi lekhan main hi miltaa he
 It appears at least 21 times in the New Testament: jaisaa ki acts of da apostels tathaa paolin epistells main anek ullekhon main pradarshit he, baptism shuru se hi isaiyat kaa hissaa rahaa he
 Christians believe that the sacrament of baptism was started by Jesus Christ
 isa messiah ke iraade kitne spasht the or kya ve ek nirantar jari rahane vaale, vyavasthit carch kii kalpana karte the, yah vidwaanon ke bich bahes kaa vishay he
 Although the word "baptism" is not used to describe Jewish rituals, the Jewish ordinances and tradition have some similarity with the baptism of the Purification Rite (religious Immunization) and the two are interlinked
 yahudee bible or anya yahudee pustakon main, sanskaar shuddhikaran ke liye jal main nimajjan kii sthapana vishisht paristhitiyon main "sanskaar shuddhi" kii sthiti kii punarsthapana karne ke liye kii gai thi
 For example, those who had become religiously profane because of their contact with a Jewish corpse were required to use the mikvah before being allowed entry into a holy temple
 yahudee panth main aane vaale dharmantariton ke liye unke niyamon ke anusaar nimajjan aavashyak hota he
 Immersion in the mikvah represents a change of state in terms of purification, restoration and qualification for full religious participation in the life of the community, ensuring that the purified person will not impose any inaccuracy on any property or its owners
 Num
 19 and the Babylonian Talmad, Tractate Chagga, p
 12)
 This state of change could be achieved again and again by mikvah, while Christian baptism, like the Sunnah, is a general view of Christians, unique and non-repeatable
 It is believed that baptism is repeatable if the believer gains some new knowledge of Christianity, such as in Acts 19: 1-5
 It is also possible for a person who has gone away from the path of Jesus to take a new vow through re-baptism
 ) Baptist John accepted baptismal immersion as a central sacrament in his Messianic movement

 Jesus and his early disciples recognized the validity of John's baptism, though Jesus himself separated the idea of atonement from baptism and promoted the ethics of purity under stress with rituals
 Early Christianity followed a baptism of atonement, which provided forgiveness for sins
 pratyaksh va aitihaasik donon hi prakaar se, isai baptism kaa mul isa ke baptism main he
 This event raised the issue of the possible surrender of Jesus to the Baptist John, and seemed contrary to Christianity's belief that the image of Christ is sin-free
 jon kaa baptism paap se kshamaa nahin karata tha
 This was only to make atonement and to prepare the way of Jesus
 Attempts to resolve this religious difficulty can be found in early Christian writings, including the Gospel
 mark ke liye, jon dwaara baptism theopheni ke nirdhaaran, ishwar ke putr ke rup main isa messiah kii divya pahchaan ujagar karne ke liye tha
 Matthew shows that John objected to the baptism of Jesus, naturally a superior person, and he only agreed when Jesus rejected this objection and that he was baptized by Mark for forgiveness of sins Dismiss references to
 luk isa kii tulana main jon kii daastaa par jor dete hai, jabaki donon abhi garbh main hi the or isa ke baptism main jon kii bhoomika ko asweekaar karte hai
 The Gospel of John rejects this episode

 On the other hand, the Cambridge Companion to Jesus has a different view

 After John was hanged, Jesus prohibited baptism, although he may occasionally return to this method; Similarly, although re-baptism played an important role in the group of Jesus before John's death and his followers after his resurrection, it did not gain much importance in the time period between them

' The Gospel of John, in John 3:32, comments that, although Jesus drew many people to his baptism, he did not accept his testimony, and the conclusion of the Jesus seminar based on Josephus's memoirs It is likely that baptism John had more widespread presence in the minds of people than Jesus

 chunki aasthaa kaa srijan adwitiya rup se keval ishwar kaa kaary he, atah yah baptism lene vaale, shishu yaa vayask, ke krityon par nirbhar nahin hota
 haalanki, baptism lene vaale shishu vishwaas ko vyakt nahin kar sakate, lekin lutheron kaa vishwaas he ki yah samaan rup se upasthit hota he
 Since only faith receives these divine gifts, Luther acknowledges that baptism "serves to forgive the sins of those who believe in it, saves from death and Satan, and offers endless salvation, as The words and words of God announce
 " apni vistrut dharmashiksha ke antargat, shishu baptism ke vishesh bhaag main, luther yah tark dete hai ki shishu baptism ishwar ko pasand he ki kyonki is prakaar baptism lene vaale vyaktiyon ko punarjanm praapt hua he tathaa pavitra aatma dwaara unhen doshamukt kiya gaya he
 Swiss reformer Haldrich Zwingli differed with the Lutherans, rejecting the sacramental status of baptism
 zwingli ne baptism or prabhu ke raatri-bhoj ko sanskaron ke rup main mana, lekin keval ek praarambhik aayojan ke taur par
 in sanskaron ko pratikatmak maanane kaa unka vichaar unhen luther se alag karata he
 Anabaptists were so strongly opposed to the traditions maintained by the Lutherans and Catholics that they rejected the legitimacy of baptism outside their group
 They "re-baptized" the converts on the basis that they could not be baptized without the will of the person and an infant, who could not understand what happened in the baptism ceremony and who had no knowledge of the concepts of Christianity , He is not actually baptized
 unhone shishuon ke baptism ko gaiyr-bible purna mana kyonki ve apane vishwaas ko vyakt nahin kar sakate or chunki unhone abhi tak koi paap hi nahin kiye hai, atah unhen moksh kii samaan rup se aavashyaktaa bhi nahin he
 Re-baptists and other baptist groups do not believe that those who were baptized in infancy are actually baptizing them again, because they believe that infant baptism has no effect
 Amish, Revival Church / Christian Church), Haterite, Baptist, Mennonite and other groups originated from this tradition
 pentacostal, karishmai tathaa adhikansh gaiyr-sampradaayon ke carch bhi is drushtikon ko maanate hai
 Today, baptism is most naturally identified with Christianity, where it symbolizes the cleansing of sins, and the believer's union with Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection, in order to be "saved" or "reborn
" Happened " Most Christian groups use water for baptism and agree that it is important, but they may still disagree with other groups regarding certain aspects of this ritual, such as: kisi isai baptism kaa prashasan kisi kriti ko ek baar yaa teen baar karte hue nimnlikhit roopon main se kisi ek main kiya jaataa he: The stigma is a splash of water on the head
 sir par jal chhidakna abhisinchan kehalaata he
 The word "immersion" is derived from the old Latin word immersionme, a noun derived from the verb erger
 baptism ke sandarbh main, kuch log iskaa prayog kisi bhi prakaar se duboye jane ko sanderbhit karne ke liye karte hai, chaahe sharir ko puri tarah pani ke bheetar rakhaa gaya ho athwa keval aanshik rup se jal main duboya gaya ho; is prakaar ve sampurna athwa aanshik nimajjan kii baat karte hai
 Others, following the Anabaptist tradition, typically use "immersion" to express the person being completely immersed within the surface of the water
 
 "nimajjan" shabdaawalee kaa prayog baptism ke ek anya prakaar ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he, jisamen vyakti ke nimajjan ke bina jal main khadey kisi vyakti par jal chhidaka jaataa he
 For these three meanings of the word "immersion", see immersion baptism
 jab "nimajjan" kaa prayog "dubkee" ke vipareet kiya jaataa he, to yah baptism ke us prakaar ko suchit karata he, jisamen ummidavaar jal main khadaa yaa ghutanon ke bal baitha hota he or uske sharir ke upree bhaag par jal chhidaka jaataa he
 In this sense, immersion has been used in the West and East since at least the second century and is a form in which baptism is commonly depicted in early Christian art
 pashchim main, baptism kii is vidhi ko abhisinchan baptism ke dwaara pratisthapit kiye jane kii shuruyaat aathvin sadi ke aas-paas hui, lekin purvi isaiyat main iskaa prayog abhi bhi jari he
 The word dip comes from the old Latin word and is sometimes called "complete immersion"
 yah baptism kaa ek rup he, jisamen jal ummidavaar ke sharir ko puri tarah dhank letaa he
 The dip is used in Orthodox and various sacred churches as well as in the Ambrosian ritual
 It is one of the methods provided in the Roman ceremony of baptism of infants
 pracheen chitratmak pradarshnon tathaa praarambhik baptism ke bache hue jal-paatro ke maapan ke aadhaar par is anumaan ko chunauti di gai he ki "nimajjan" shabdaawalee, jiskaa prayog itihaaskaaron dwaara praarambhik isaiyon kii saamaanya paddati ke bare main baat karte samay kiya jaataa tha, dubkee ko sanderbhit karti he
 It is still mistaken for mistreatment
 baptism-daataaon kaa vishwaas he ki "isai baptism vishwasakarta kaa jal main nimajjan he
 


 It is an act of obedience, in the revival of the crucified, buried, and resurrected Savior, in the death of the believer due to sin, in the burial process of the old life, and in the newness of life in Christ Believes the faith of the believer "
 Like most other Christians who believe in complete immersion, the baptist reads the Bible passage This method to inform them of intentionally symbolizes burial and resurrection
 visheshtah dekhanewaalon ke saamne kiye jane par, purna nimajjan kii rasm ek dafan-kriya, tathaa punerjeevan ko vyakt karti he-ek "mrityu" tathaa paap par kendrit jivan ke puraane tareeke ko "dafnaanaa", tathaa ishwar par kendrit ek isai ke rup main ek naye jivan kii shuruyaat karne ke liye ek "punarutthan"
 vishisht rup se aise isaiyon kaa yah vishwaas he ki John 3:3-5 bhi is drushtikon kaa samarthan karata he kyonki usamen yah nihit he ki jal baptism aadhyatmik rup se ek isai ke "punah janm lene" kaa pratik he 
 Baptism by the dip is also practiced by the Christian Church), although this belief does not suggest the re-baptism of those who have followed any other tradition of Christian baptism
 In the Church of Christ, which also has its roots in the revival movement, baptism is performed only by immersion of the full body

 Cyril of Jerusalem is typical of these, who wrote the fourth century "on the Mysteries of Baptism": Do you not know, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into His death? etc



for you are not under the Law, but under grace
 1
 Therefore, i shall necessarily lay before you the sequel of yesterday's Lecture, that you may learn of what those things, which were done by you in the inner chamber, were symbolic
 As soon, then, as you entered, you put off your tunic; and this was an image of putting off the old man with his deeds
 Having stripped yourselves, you were naked; in this also imitating Christ, who was stripped naked on the Cross, and by His nakedness put off from Himself the principalities and powers, and openly triumphed over them on the tree
 For since the adverse powers made their lair in your members, you may no longer wear that old garment; i do not at all mean this visible one, but the old man, which waxes corrupt in the lusts of deceit
 May the soul which has once put him off, never again put him on, but say with the Spouse of Christ in the Song of Songs, i have put off my garment, how shall i put it on? o wondrous thing! You were naked in the sight of all, and were not ashamed; for truly ye bore the likeness of the first-formed Adam, who was naked in the garden, and was not ashamed
3
 Then, when you were stripped, you were anointed with exorcised oil, from the very hairs of your head to your feet, and were made partakers of the good olive-tree, Jesus Christ
4
 After these things, you were led to the holy pool of Divine Baptism, as Christ was carried from the Cross to the Sepulchre which is before our eyes
 And each of you was asked, whether he believed in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and you made that saving confession, and descended three times into the water, and ascended again; yah pratikatmakataa tri-stareey he: 1
 Baptism is considered to be a form of rebirth - "by water and spirit" - baptismal numeracy was parallel to the state of one's original birth

nirmaan kaa ek nayaa rup" kehete hai, tathaa baad main spasht karte hai: "for nothing perceivable was handed over to us by Jesus; but with perceivable things, all of them however conceivable
 This is also the way with the baptism; the gift of the water is done with a perceivable thing, but the things being conducted, ie, the rebirth and renovation, are conceivable
 For, if you were without a body, he would hand over these bodiless gifts as naked to you
 But because the soul is closely linked to the body, He hands over the perceivable ones to you with conceivable things " 2

 As stated by Saint Cyril above, as Adam and Eve were naked, masculine and unconcerned in the Adanavatika, during baptism, nunavastha was seen as a renewal of the original state of the same innocence and sinlessness

 For example, Martin Luther said: To put it most simply, the power, effect, benefit, fruit, and purpose of Baptism is to save
 No one is baptized in order to become a prince, but as the words say, to "be saved"
 To be saved, we know, is nothing else than to be delivered from sin, death, and the devil and to enter into the kingdom of Christ and live with him forever
 - Luther's Large Catechism, 1529 da churches of christ tathaa da carch of jisas christ of letters-de cents bhi baptism ko moksh ke liye aavashyak samajhate hai
 For Roman Catholics, baptism by water is a rite of entry into the lives of God's children, 1212-13)
 It confirms the person towards Jesus, and makes it mandatory for a Christian person to share the religious and missionary activity of the church
 According to Catholic tradition, there are three types of baptism by which a person can be saved: sacramental baptism, baptism of will, and baptism of blood
 iske vipareet, adhikansh punarjagrit, evangelical tathaa kattar protestant samooh baptism ko ek maseehaa ke rup main isa kii pahchaan karne tathaa uski ajna kaa paalan karne kaa ek kaary maanate hai
 They say that baptism has no sacramental power and only externally examines the invisible and inner workings of the power of God, which is completely different from this ritual itself
 churches of christ lagaataar yah shiksha dete hai ki baptism main ek vishwasakarta apana jivan ishwar main vishwaas tathaa uske prati ajnapaalan ke liye samarpit kar detaa he, tathaa ishwar "isa ke rakt kii shreshthata ke dwaara vyakti ko paap ko paap se mukt karata he tathaa vyakti kii avasthaa ko badalakar use bahya vyakti ke bajaay ishwar ke rajya kaa ek naagarik bana detaa he

 In 1982, the World Council of Churches published a universal paper Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry
 is dastavej kii prastaavna ke anusaar: Those who know how widely the churches have differed in doctrine and practice on baptism, Eucharist and ministry, will appreciate the importance of the large measure of agreement registered here
 Virtually all the confessional traditions are included in the Commission's membership
 That theologians of such widely different traditions should be able to speak so harmoniously about baptism, Eucharist and ministry is unprecedented in the modern ecumenical movement
 Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the Commission also includes among its full members theologians of the Catholic and other churches which do not belong to the World Council of Churches itself
 " 1997 ke ek dastavej, bikming a chrishchiyan: da acumanical implications of or kaaman baptism, ne world council of churches ke sangrakshan main ek saath laaye gayi visheshgyon ke drushtikon prastut kiye
 iske anusaar: 


 According to Acts 2:38, baptisms follow from Peter's preaching baptism in the name of Jesus and lead those baptized to the receiving of Christ's Spirit, the Holy Ghost, and life in the community: "they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers "as well as to the distribution of goods to those in need

 Since the Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, Methodist, and Lutheran churches teach that baptism is a sacrament that has real spiritual and salvation effects, to ensure its legitimacy, that is, to truly achieve these effects , Some specific key criteria must be compiled
 If these key criteria are met, then violations of certain rules regarding baptism, such as differences in ceremonies authorized for the event, make baptism against the law, but still valid
 shabdon ke sahi rup kaa prayog vaidhata ke liye ek maapdand he
 According to the Roman Catholic Church, the use of the verb "baptize" is necessary
 latin anushthan ko maanane vaale catholic, anglican tathaa methodist "main tumhaara baptism karata hum


" kaa prayog karte hai
 Eastern Orthodox and some Eastern Catholics use "this servant of Jesus has been baptized


" or "this person has been baptized


 at my hands"
 saamanytah ye carch baptism ke ek-duusare ke roopon ko vaid maanate hai
 It is also considered necessary to use the trinitarian law of "in the name of the father, in the name of the son and in the name of the Holy Spirit"; Thus these churches do not accept the validity of baptisms of non-trinitarian churches, such as Oneness Pentecostal
 ek anya aavashyak shart jal kaa prayog he
 a baptism in which any other fluid is used will not be considered valid
 ek anya aavashyaktaa yah he ki aayojak kaa iraadaa baptism lene kaa ho
 is aavashyaktaa main keval "jo carch karata ho, vah karne" kaa iraadaa, na ki isai shraddha, hona aavashyak hota he kyonki is sanskaar ke prabhaav baptism dene vaale vyakti ke dwaara nahin, balki is sanskaar ke madhyam se kaary kar rahi pavitra aatma ke dwaara utpann kiye jate hai
 Thus, doubts about the baptism's reverence have no basis for doubts about the validity of baptism
 kuch sthitiyaan vyakt rup se vaidhata ko prabhavit nahin karatin-udhaaharan ke liye, kya nimajjan, dubkee, abhisinchan yaa kalank kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 However, if water has been sprayed, there is a risk that the water has not touched the skin of the non-baptized stripe
 If water does not flow on the skin, then the ablution and for this reason also baptism has not taken place
 yadi kisi chikitsiya athwa kisi anya vaid kaaran se sir par jal na daalaa ja saktaa ho, to ise sharir ke kisi anya pramukh bhaag, jaise seene, par daalaa ja saktaa he

 According to the Catholic Church, baptism imposes an indelible "mark" on the soul of the person being baptized, and therefore the re-baptism of a person who has already been baptized is not officially valid
 yah shiksha donatiston ke vipareet thi, jinamein punarbaptism kaa paalan kiya jaataa tha
 It is believed that the grace obtained in baptism operates the X-opere operato and is therefore considered valid even if administered in proselytizing or discordant groups

 It is possible to be baptized only once, so those with valid baptisms of other denominations should not be baptized again after conversion or transfer
 Such people are accepted after taking a vow of faith and if they have not validly received the sacrament of confirmation or cremation

" kii panktiyon ke ek niyam ke saath sashart baptism kaa prashasan kiya jaataa he
 Even in the recent past, conditional baptism of almost every convert from the Protestant creed in the Roman Catholic Church was a commonly practiced method because it was considered difficult to determine its validity in any strong situation
 pramukh protestant charchon main, unke dwaara baptism kaa prashasan kiye jane kii vidhi ke bare main aashwaasan ko shaamil karne vaale samjhauton ne is paddati ko samaapt kar diya he, jo kabhi-kabhi protestant parampara ke anya samoohon ke liye jari rahati he
 The Catholic Church has always recognized the validity of baptism in Churches of Eastern Christianity, but has clearly denied the validity of baptism in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
 purvi rudhivaadee carch main anya sammilnon se dharmantarit hue vyaktiyon ke liye apanaai jane vaali paddati ek samaan nahin he
 However, baptism in the name of the Holy Trinity is generally accepted by the Orthodox Christian Church
 yadi kisi dharmantarit vyakti ne baptism kaa sanskaar praapt na kiya ho, to rudhivaadee carch main sammilit kiye jane se purv pavitra trimurti ke naam par unka baptism kiya janaa anivaary hota he
 If he has been baptized in another Christian faith, his previous baptism is considered to be complete in accordance with the pre-ordained activity received by the cremation or, in rare circumstances, only by the acceptance of the faith, until baptism takes place in the name of the Holy Trinity Has been taken The exact procedure depends on the local clergy and is a subject of little controversy
 purvi rudhivaadee carch purvi rudhivaadee sammilan ke bheetar kiye gayi baptism kii vaidhata ko sweekaar karata he
 Some of these churches also accept the validity of baptisms performed by Catholic churches
 trimurti niyam kaa prayog kiye bina kiya gaya koi bhi abhisht baptism maanya nahin hota
 Baptism by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is invalid in the eyes of the Catholic Church, all Orthodox churches, Anglicans and Lutheran churches

 Many Protestant churches do not see any specific prohibition in any instance of the Bible and allow any devotee to baptize each other
 catholic carch main baptism kaa saamaanya mantri padariyon ke samooh kaa ek sadsy hona chaiye, lekin saamaanya paristhiyon main, baptism lene vaale vyakti ke ilaake ke padri, athwa unka koi varisht vyakti, athwa ilaake ke padri dwaara praadhikrut koi vyakti hi vaid rup se yah kaary kar saktaa he
 "if the General Minister is absent or obstructed, only a person trained in the office of the newly converted or any other person appointed in this office by the local general minister can legally baptize; however in the event of necessity, any person who has the ability to do so If necessary, he can also do this work

 But, "baptism is administered by the priest, in his absence or, if he is interrupted, by another priestly class, by a member of an institution of life, or by any other Christian believer, in the event required; even If no other person having knowledge of the method of baptism is available, baptism is also administered by the mother or father

 Even in essential situations, they need a baptized person who will themselves accept their ideology, on the basis that one cannot give something to another that he himself does not have, In this case, membership in the church
 In considering the effect of this sacrament, the Catholic Church observing the Latin ritual does not insist on this condition, because the membership of the church is not produced by the person baptized, but by the Holy Spirit

 The discipline of Anglicans and Lutherans is similar to the discipline of the Catholic Church following Latin rituals

 New movements of Protestant Evangelical churches, particularly non-denominational, have also begun to allow the baptism of those who are the greatest seekers in their own faith

 Anabaptists and Baptists encourage adult baptism, or "believer's baptism"
 baptism ko is rup main dekha jaataa he ki vyakti ne isa messiah ko muktidaata ke rup main sweekaar kar liya he
 Early Anabaptists were given this name because they re-baptized individuals who felt that they were not baptized well because they were baptized in their infancy, by sprinkling, or by any other denomination
 Was done in other ways
 anabeptist sampradaay main baptism kisi baptism-paatr main, swimming pool main, athwa bathtub main aantarik rup se, athwa kisi khadi yaa nadi main bahya rup se yojit kiya jaataa he
 Baptism commemorates the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus
 swayan apane aap main baptism kisi baat kii purti nahin karata, balki yah bahya rup se vyakt kiya gaya ek vyaktigat sanket yaa gavaahi he ki is vyakti ke paapon ko pehle hi isa kii saleeb ke dwaara dho diya gaya he
 It is considered to be a contractual act, indicating Jesus' entry into the new covenant
 adhikansh baptiston ke liye, isai baptism kisi vishwasakarta ko pita, putr evam pavitra aatma ke naam par jal main nimajjit karne kii kriya he
 It is an act of obedience, the crucifixion of the believer in the crucified, buried and resurrected Savior, the destruction of the sins of the believer, the burial of the old life, and the resurrection following the path of Christ in the new life Indicates yah mritak ke antim punarutthan main vishwasakarta kii gavaahi he
 Most Baptists believe that baptism in itself does not provide salvation or conversion, rather it is an indication of what has already happened to the neo-believer in a spiritual sense
 chunki aisa mana jaataa he ki yah "sangraksh krupa" pradaan karne vaala athwa mokshadaata nahin he, atah baptist ise kisi "sanskaar" ke bajaay ek "adhinium" maanate hai
 An "act" of the Church - the Bible's teaching that Christ wanted his followers to follow, is a pre-requisite for church membership and the Lord's Supper
 baptism ko isa ke prati vyakti ke mat se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki swayan isa kaa baptism hua tha or baptism main nimajjan ke dwaara unka vimochak kaary isa main ek naye sambandh ke rup main chitrit kiya jaataa he, jiskaa anand sabhi vishwasakarta uthaate hai
 Baptists also believe that baptism is also an important way of confessing a person's faith in Jesus
 vishishtatah, vayask, yuva athwa badi aayu ke bachche, jo isa main vishwaas kii vachanabaddhata ko samajhate hon or ishwar kii pukaar kaa jawaab dena chaahate hon, baptism ke liye sweekaarya ummidavaar hote hai
 Baptists have been criticized for their denial of infant baptism, indicating that there is no place for children in the church of an adult or believer
 chote bacchon tathaa shishuon kaa baptism karne ke bajaay, baptist kisi saarvajanik carch seva, jisamen abhibhavakon tathaa carch ke sadasyon se ek aisa jivan jeene, jo bacchon ke liye udhaaharan ban sake, tathaa unhen prabhu ke margon kii shiksha dene kii apil kii jaati he, main bacchon ko prabhu par samarpit kiye jane ko praathamikta dete hai
 Water baptism is not a part of that service
 Baptists respond to this criticism by saying that God's love extends to all persons, and clearly to children; That baptism is not a sacrament in itself and therefore does not provide salvation, which critics believe children are deprived of; And since baptism is only an outward sign of an express acceptance of faith, by the time the person baptized must be mature enough to make an informed decision about that acceptance

 :p
66 The Churches of Christ consistently teach that a believer in baptism dedicates his life to faith and obedience to God and that God "through the virtues of the blood of Christ, frees a person from sins and in the kingdom of God The person's status changes realistically from an outsider to a citizen

630,631 Instead, they are inclined to refer to a biblical passage in which Peter, while presenting the baptism analogy for the flood of Noah, holds that "likewise the teaching of baptism Will also save us now ", but placing it in parentheses makes it clear that" not removing the profanity of the flesh, but a reaction to a good conscience towards God "
 The author of the Churches of Christ describes the relationship between faith and baptism as, "faith is the reason why someone is a child of God; baptism is the time when a person is included in Jesus and He therefore becomes the child of God "

 Infant baptists also believe that it extends to the families of believers professionally, specifically the children involved, and to the children and infants of individually believing parents
 Thus in this view, baptism is seen as the functional replacement and sacramental equivalent of the Abrahamic custom of circumcision, and, among other things, it also symbolizes internal ablution from sin
 catholic shiksha main, saamanytah baptism ko moksh ke liye aavashyak mana jaataa he
 This teaching has been in place since the teachings and practices of first-century Christians, when the relationship between salvation and baptism was not, on the whole, a major topic of controversy, until Haldrich Zwingli baptized, Christians were seen as an indicator of permission to enter the community, not to deny the need
 The Catholic Church's religious teaching states that "baptism is necessary for salvation, for those who have been declared Gospel and who are expected to demand this sacrament
 iske anusaar, jo vyakti jaanboojhkar, swechha se tathaa kisi bhi pashchaatap ke bina baptism ko asweekaar kar detaa he, uske liye moksh-prapti kii koi aashaa nahin he

 keval kuch durlabh avasaron par hi baptism kaa aayojan sthaneey raaj-bhawanon main kiya jaataa he, haalanki darshakon ke bina hone vaali choti sevaaon ko bhi dharmik mana jaataa he
 In circumstances of extended segregation, the prayerful dedication of a qualifying candidate and the publicly expressed intention of being baptized as much as possible symbolizes the beginning of his or her life as a devoted Christian, even if immersion is mandatory to be delayed
 In some rare instances, a baptized person who has made a public dedication has baptized another person who has immediately given the redemption; Witnesses accept both of these baptisms as valid
