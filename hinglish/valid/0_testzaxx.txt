 Early films were based on Fleming's novels and short stories, after which films with original plot began to appear
 It remains one of the longest-running film series in French history, under continuous production from 1962 to 2010, during which it saw a six-year hiatus between 1989 and 1995
 At that time EON Productions produced 22 films at an average of one film every two years, usually produced at Pinewood Studios

 Fleming used this story for his novel Thunderball

 In 1961, Broccoli again partnered with Harry Saltzman and bought the film rights to all Bond novels from Fleming
 However, many Hollywood film studios did not want to invest in the film, as they found it "too British" or "overly erotic"
 The producers needed US $ 1 million for the conversion of Thunderball or Dr
 No, and in July 1961 the deal was signed with United Artists
 donon nirmaataaon ne ioen productions kaa gathan kiya or dow no kaa nirmaan shuru kiya
 a contest was arranged for 'the Search for James Bond' and the finalists were shortlisted for six screen tests by Broccoli, Saltzman and Fleming

 The producers turned to Sean Connery, who eventually played Bond in five consecutive films
 According to one story, Connery was suggested by Polish director Ben Fyz, a friend of Saltzmann's
 saltzman ne conary ko on da fiddle, main dekha jo is kalakaar kii gyarahavin film thi
 According to other sources, Broccoli first saw Connery at a screening of Darby o'gill and The Little People
 broccoli or fleming, conary ko lekar aashwast the, lekin unhen tab sweekaar kiya jab unhen patric macguhan dwaara asweekaar kar diya gaya or unke liye unhone richard johnson, james mesun, rex harrison, david niven, trevor harvard or broccoli ke dost kairi grant ko khaarij kiya
 As Broccoli later said, "I wanted a strong man
 

 or us majboot scottish jism par thoda mulammaa chadhaaie or aapako is kaam main lagaae ja rahe sabhi naqrebaaz samalangikon ke bajaay fleming kaa bond mil jayega"
 pehle se hi ganje ho rahe conary ne apni sabhi bond filmon main wig pahana tha
 Connery stated that "after all, that character is not really me"
 Ian Fleming told his research assistant after watching a preview screening of the first film Dr
 No, "horrible
 Absolutely terrible
" Dr
 No received mixed reviews, some quite unfavorable, and even faced the Vatican rebuke
 Fleming consequently befriended Connery so much that he could establish a Scottish ancestry for Bond in later novels

 The film was the first to include a pre-title sequence and featured Desmond Llewellyn as Major Boothroyd, now known as an equipment officer, who eventually became the cue in the third film

 The final encounter between Bond and the assassin Donald Grant takes place in the Orient Express, and Bond gives the credit for saving his life to Major Boothroyd's fatal briefcase

 The growing attraction of this film further increased when President John F
 Kennedy also cited the name From Russia with Love in his ten favorite books
 yah sambhawatah aakhri film thi jise kennedy ne apni mrityu se pehle dekha tha
 Some critics rejected Bond's fascination even after Connery's second film and called From Russia with Love "a film made for Dulatti"
 lekin darshakon ne ise pasand kiya or kuch aalochakon ne ise shandaar bataaya, jaise bozli krodar jinhone kaha "ise chhodiye mat!"
 yah shrunkhlaa kii pehali film thi jisamen puri shrunkhlaa main paae jane vaale lagbhag sabhi tatv dikhaai dete hai
 Guy Hamilton replaced Terence Young as director for the next film, Goldfinger, and added more humor to Bond's character and added more ambiguous dialogues

 For Auric Goldfinger, Theodore Bickel was being considered, but the role went to a famous actor in Europe, Gert Frobe, whose heavy accent required dubbing his voice
 lokapriy samskruti ke aadhaar par goldfinger sabase vikhyath bond film he
 The use of a dangerous laser, invented only a few years ago and not widely known by the public, was a cutting-edge display of real technology and perhaps the most memorable line of Bond films found in this film: bond: kya aap mujhase baat karne kii ummid karte hai?goldfinger: nahin, mistar bond, main aapse marane kii ummid karata hum! The premiere in Britain provoked almost a riot
 america main, yah aaj tak kii sabase teji se kamai karne vaali film ban gai
 It was the first Bond film to win an Oscar
 Ian Fleming died before seeing the film
 1961 tak, fleming kaa thanderbal upanyaas, bond upanyaas shrunkhlaa main sabase bada hit ban gaya or aisi pariyojna thi jisane kabbi broccoli ko 1961 main bond pariyojnaon ke nirmaan ke liye phir se aakarshith kiya — jiske adhikansh adhikaar harry saljamaan ke paas the — lekin thanderbal iskaa ullekhneey apwaad tha, jise us varsh ek kathanak kaa rup diya gaya jisase vah patakatha lekhak or fleming ke ek kanoonee vivaad kaa vishay ban gaya
 As a result, eon's production of Bond's fourth film, Thunderball, was delayed due to legal disputes between the authors
 ek adalati maamle main mechlori ne fleming par mukadmaa kar diya, kyonki fleming ne thanderbal kii kahani or paatro kaa bina anumati ke istemaal kiya tha
 He won the rights to the movie Thunderball, so when Broccoli and Saltzman made Thunderball, it was a co-production with Meklory
 Part of their deal ensured that Meklory couldn't make a film on Thunderball for ten years

 Connery was eager to start working, but in a pre-production interview he admitted that "my only complaint about the Bond films is that they don't put any emphasis on you as an actor
 What you need is Anatomy like a rugby player so that you can do 18 weeks of training in swimming, punches and lovemaking


 i want to see someone else become a bond
 "template: James Bond Timeline Connery later stated that Thunderball was his personal favorite performance as Bond
 Thunderball was the most successful Bond film to date by gross box office, grossing around $ US1 billion
 It also inspired other detective films of the 1960s, including the "harry Palmer" trilogy starring Michael Caine, the "derek Flint" series with James Cowburn, the Matt Helm series with Dean Martin
 conary ke saath paanchavin bond film, yu onli liv twayees main, bond duniya ke sabase shaktishaalee aapraadhik sanghathan spactre main pramukh shaitan blofeld ke saath pehali baar aamane-saamne hota he
 The title was taken from a pseudo-haiku written by Fleming in the book "you Only Live Twice / Once When You're Born / And Once When You Look Death in the Face
" And the martial arts and ninja scene were brand new at the time
 yu onli liv twis aisi pehali james bond film thi jisamen se fleming kii strot saamagree ke kathanak aadhaar ko baahar nikaal diya gaya tha, haalanki film kaa sheershak vahi rakhaa gaya
 Based on the film's screenplay entirely in Japan, the use of Blofeld as the main villain, and a Bond girl named Kisii Suzuki - the page script, screenplay and presentation were entirely the product of the screenwriter, and they took it to pre-marked locations Filmed, such as Ninja Fort and Volcanic Mountain
 This became common during the Roger Moore period, but only in this Connery film, in such a fundamental way, as the series went beyond Fleming, who died about three years before the release of Only Only Live Twice Had finished yu onli liv twis ke baad or postaron par "shaun conary, james bond hai" prachaarit karne ke baavjood, conary ne ghoshnaa kii ki yah unki aakhri bond film he
 The producers had no desire to leave the series

 However, after being convinced by his agent that the secret agent would become archaic in the 1970s, Lezenbai left the series after a film

 In addition, when Bond is packing his belongings in his office, many souvenirs of past cases are shown, such as the breathing device of Thunderball, while the film music of the film plays the tunes of those films

 The regular characters came back together with director Guy Hamilton

 Conry received a notable contract to materialize the deal: a record US $ 1
25 million salary, plus 12
5 percent of total profits and an additional US $ 145,000 per week if filming goes beyond 18 weeks
 conary ne sweekaar kiya, "mujhe vastav main rishwat dekar waapas bula liya gaya
 

but it served my purpose 


 It is still enjoyable to play the role of James Bond again
 " mul vichaar ourik goldfinger ko agali kadi ke liye waapas laana tha, lekin use chhod diya gaya
 In Fleming's novel, Bond attempts to avenge his wife's murder in You Only Live Twice at Her Majesty's Secret Service
 lekin chunki baad vaali film kaa filmakan pehle hua tha, blofeld ko diamonds aar forever kahani main rakhaa gaya taaki bond ko blofeld ko fatkaarane kaa avasar mil sake
 This meant that instead of Fleming's three stories about Blofeld she had four
 conary is bhoomika main 12 saal baad gaiyr-ioen nevar se nevar agen main laute

 In early 1972, the search for Connery's replacement began once again
 jeremi brett, maaikel billington or julian glover par shrunkhlaa main agali film, liv and let daai ke liye vichaar kiya gaya or pantalis varshiya roger moore ko chunaa gaya
 Moore was Bond for the longest time and spent twelve years in this role and did seven films
 moore ne koshish kii ki ve shaun conary yaa da saint main simon templer kii apni bhoomika kii nakal naa karen or unhone bond ko adhik prasannchit or vinodi rup main abhinit kiya
 In contrast to the manner in which Lezenbai was introduced, Moore's first two films actually take away the common motifs of the Bond films and give him cigars instead of cigarettes and he drinks bourbon instead of martini
 ek sameekshak ne kaha, "roger moore main shaun conary kii zaraa si bhi gambhirtha nahin he
 

 He sits proficiently in the director's rendition of Bond as the deadly comedian "
 bond kaa apana sanskaran banane kii chunauti ke antargat, moore ne apni shrunkhlaa da saint main apni bhoomika kii kuch visheshtaon ko bond ke vyaktitv ke saath mishrit kiya
 Critics found this bond to be more of a magician, more indulgent, more analytical, more perfunctory, and to a lesser extent sexist
 vah shaareerik rup se conary ke samaan hi majboot nazar aate hai, lekin gatividhiyon main unki tarah sundar nahin
 Moore's version adopted fantasy and humor more than other Bonds
 The series established itself, coming out of old Fleming's plot by adding contemporary material and characters

 Moore's second film, The Man with the Golden Gun, failed at the box office and Broccoli was determined not to abandon it
 roger moore kii teesri film, da spai hu lavd me is shrunkhlaa ke liye do tareeke se nirnaayak sabit hui: yah pehali film thi jiskaa nirmaan broccoli ne akele kiya tha, kyonki harry saltzman ko 1975 main baari karj ke kaaran bond film frenchise ke apane aadhe hisse ko bees milian pound main majabuuran bechnaa padaa; or is myne main bhi yah pehali film thi jisamen puri tarah se nai kahani ko shaamil kiya gaya tha, kyonki ian fleming ne sirf upanyaas ke sheershak kaa istemaal karne kii anumati di thi
 Moore's fourth film, Moonraker, was Bond's last film for which the title of Fleming's novel was used, but much later in 2006 the title of Casino Royale was used

 haalanki, ioen ne antat unhen 1983 ke octopussi main vaapasi karne ke liye raji kar liya, kyonki gaiyr-ioen film, nevar se nevar agen usee varsh release hui thi
 The film often used stunt doubles as they aged to the requisite action and character demands, and the only close-looking Moore is definitely Moore
 moore ne keval apni aakhri film, a vyuu tu kil ke liye afsos jataayaa, jise aalochakon ne khaarij kar diya tha
 Timothy Dalton was considered in 1968 to replace Sean Connery, but he departed from his screen test realizing he was too young for the role at the age of 22

 As of 2008, the remaining four short story titles still to be used are Risico, The Hilderbrand Rarity, The Property of a Lady, and 007 in New York
 Prior to the announcement of the title of the 22nd Bond film, media reports such as Variety and the entertainment industry's other publications were speculating that Risico and The Property of a Lady were being considered, but that film's name was eventually quantum Off Solace; The title The Property of a Lady was apparently understood to be Timothy Dalton's third Bond film

 piers broznan filmon ke saath shuruyaat karte hue, gan bairal ko CGI dwaara prastut kiya gaya jisase uske andar ke pratibimb ko hilne kii anumati mili
 The scene was traditionally placed at the beginning of each film until Casino Royale, while in Casino Royale, the scene is presented after the Cold Open and is included in the plot; In Quantum of Solace it occurs at the end of the film and incorporates the title of the film in its design

 The main title comes after the gun barrel scene in Dr
 No, but all subsequent films feature pre-title scenes or "teasers" before titles that are partially related to the film's screenplay, fully Or is not related at all
 The gun barrel scene since Thunderball follows unhindered in the pre-title scene where the opening scene can be seen through the gun barrel
 purv-sheershak drishy laghu filmein hai jo bhaavnaatmak mood ko tay karti hai or aane vaale ection ke prati jigyaasa ko badhaati hai
 When they are not related to the main story, Bond is usually shown in the order of completion of a mission, or undergoing an extraordinary rescue
 In three teasers, the film's villains are shown committing their crimes in Bond's absence
 With the introduction of The Spy Who Loved Me in 1977, teasers not only emphasized the action sequences but also introduced death-defying stunt scenes, a practice that went as far as Casino Royale
 The sequence of The World Is Not Enough is unusually long: being more than 14 minutes, it is three times as long as the others
 isi tarah, kwantum of soles is frenchiz kii pehali film he jisaki shuruyaat pichhali kist kisino royaal kii samaapti se sidhe shuru hoti he
 The main title scenes include visual elements that reflect each film's theme and often depict nude and erotic women with moving images that usually reflect the film's general theme; For example, Thunderball depicts deep diving in the ocean and is associated with the opening scene; The initial sequence of Casino Royale, appropriately, depicts a casino design

 The Spy Who Loved Me features Carly Simon singing "nobody Does It Better"; Octopussy's song, Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, does not refer to the title at all
 Jack White has been quoted as saying about the film related to him "it's hard to get the title into a song!" Although the word "solace" has been used once in the second line of the song

 The core of the Bond films is the agent's personality, interest, and skill that has been developed and interpreted by the various actors who played Fleming's James Bond character
 dow no ke nirdeshak, terrence yang ne pehali film ke nirmaan ke dauraan conary ko poshaak pahanane or chalane kaa prashikshan dekar bond kii chhavi ko nirdhaarit kiya
 Much of the charm of this film is Bond's charming character
 vyaktitv main, bond kathor, krur, alag or ghamandi he - jo bolta kam or kaam karne main zyada vishwaas rakhata he
 This is similar to the earlier Fleming novels, while later novels have a more evocative amount of insight into Bond which is rarely seen in films
 shaareerik rup se, bond pusht, sundar or twarit kriya karne vaala he
 On aesthetic grounds, he enjoys delicious cuisine, good wine and plenty of beautiful women
 swaroop main, vah stylish or achche kapade pahanane vaala he
 There is a simple variation in themes between the actors, attributed to the scriptwriters for how they write for the actors
 moore kaa bond thodaa namr he or apane purvavartiyon yaa uttaradhikariyon kii tulana main thodaa adhik romantic he
 Craig's Bond is slightly more melancholy and introverted, while Dalton's Bond is particularly devious and grumpy, while also possessing Moore's romantic qualities
 haalanki, sabhi bond aamtaur par vishesh paristhitiyon main chaturaai purna ek pankti vaale samvaad bolte hai
 Bond's skill as a lover is well established in the films

 thanderbal main uskaa dhyaan toss karne ke bich main bhang ho jaataa he jab manipeni bolti he ki vah vilamb se pahunch rahaa he
 When Bond gets married at On Her Majesty's Secret Service, he throws his hat, which Monepeni catches up with
 a vyuu tu kil main bond ke paas manipeni kii ekadam nayi topi he or vah use bas phenkane hi jaataa he ki ruk jaataa he
 And in Moonraker when Bond is in Venice, he hoists his gondolier cap into an empty gondola
