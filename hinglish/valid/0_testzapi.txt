 Kautilya himself has also accepted the creation of his earlier economics
 apane 'arthshaastra' main kai sandarbhon main usne acharya brihaspati, bharadwaj, shukracharya, parashar, pishun, vishalaksh aadi aacharyon kaa ullekh kiya he
 Prior to Kautilya, the texts of many Acharyas are named as Dandaniti
 aisa prathit hota he ki kautilya ke purv shaastra dandniti kahe jate the or ve arthshaastra ke samroop hote the
 But as many scholars have acknowledged that both politics and economics are not identical
 you
 en
 ghoshaal ke kathananusaar arthshaastra zyada vyapak shaastra he, jabaki dandniti maatr uski shakha he
 The scriptures written after Kautilya became known as 'niti Shastra', like Kamandaka Niti'sar
 vaise kai vidwaanon ne arthshaastra ko nitishastra kii apeksha zyada vyapak mana he
 However, in the opinion of most scholars, both ethics and economics are similar and both have the same subject area
 swayan kaamandak ne nitishastra or arthshaastra ko samroop mana he
 It is clear from the above discussion that scriptures like 'arthashastra' were composed before and after Kautilya's 'arthashastra'
 is sambandh main aise vidwaanon kii acchhee-khaasi sankhya he jo yah maanate hai ki kautilya 'arthshaastra' kaa rachanaakaar nahin tha
 The number of Western scholars is more among such scholars
 sten, jolly, winternij va kith is prakaar ke vichaar ke pratipadak hai
 Indian scholar R
 G
 Bhandarkar has also supported this
 bhandarkar ne kaha he ki patanjali ne mahabhashya main kautilya kaa ullekh nahin kiya he
 Those who did not recognize Kautilya as the author of 'arthashastra', have presented the following arguments in support of their view- pustak kii samaapti par spasht rup se likhaa gaya he- It has also been written: vishnu puraana main is ghatana kii charchaa is tarah kii gai he: Confirming the incident, Kamantak, the doer of 'nitisara', wrote: in uddharanon se spasht he ki vishnugupt or kautilya ek hi vyakti the
 In the 'arthashastra' itself, at the end of the tenth chapter of the second tribunal, the name of the author of the book is named 'kautilya': pustak ke armbh main ‘kautilyon kruthan shastram’ tathaa prayek adhyay ke ant main ‘iti kautilierthshastre’ likhakar granthkaar ne apane ‘kautilya naam ko adhik vikhyath kiya he
 Wherever the opinion of other Acharyas has been expressed, in the end there is 'iti Kautilya' i
e
 Kautilya's opinion - saying thus has shown more favor to the name Kautilya
 parantu yah sarvatha nirvivaad he ki vishnugupt tathaa kautilya abhinn vyakti the
 If the later Dandi poet called it Acharya Vishnugupta, Banabhatta called it Kautilya
 donon kaa kathan he ki is acharya ne ‘dandniti’ athwa ‘arthshaastra’ kii rachana kii
 In the Panchatantra, the name of this Acharya has been given as Chanakya, the author of economics
 kavi vishakhdutt-pranit suprasiddh naatak ‘mudrarakshas’ main chanakya ko kabhi kautilya tathaa kabhi vishnugupt naam se sambodhit kiya gaya he
 'arthashastra' was created for the first Mauryan emperor Chandragupta as a 'rule of law'
 at: isaki rachana kaa kaal vahi maananaa uchit he, jo samraat chandragupta kaa kaal he
 Archaeological scholars dated this period to 321 BC
 From 296 BC Till sure
 kai anya vidwaan samraat cendrakotus ke aadhaar par nishchit kii hui is tithi ko sweekaar nahin karte
 Sukhya Moolam Dharma: dharmasy mulan arthh
 Meaning states
 rajyasy mulan indriya jayah
 Indriyajasya Moolam Vinayah
 vinayasy mulan vridhopaseva
sukh kaa mul he, dharm
 Meaning of religion is Artha
 arth kaa mul he, rajya
 The root of the kingdom is victory over the senses
 indriyajay kaa mul he, vinay
 The core of Vinay is service to the aged
 jaise upar kaha gaya he, iskaa mukhya vishay shashan-vidhi athwa shashan-vigyaan he: ‘‘kautilyon narendrarthey shashansy vidhi: krit:
 "it is clear from these words that Acharya composed it as a method of political science and especially governance
 arthshaastra kii vishay-suchi ko dekhne se yah sarvatha pramanit ho jaataa he ki ise aajkal kahe jane vaale arthshaastra kii pustak kahana bhul he
 At the beginning of the first tribunal itself, Acharya himself has informed it by the name 'dandaniti'
 shukracharya ne dandniti ko itani mahatvapurn vidya batalaaya he ki isamen anya sab vidyaon kaa antarbhaav maan liya he- kyonki 'shastren rakshite deshe shastrachintaa pravartate' kii ukti ke anusaar shastr dwaara sushasit tathaa surakshit desh main hi veda aadi anya shastron kii chintaa yaa anushilan ho saktaa he
 Therefore, it is necessary to accept penalism as the basic discipline of all other disciplines, and the same punishment is economics
 jise aajkal arthshaastra kaha jaataa he, uske liye 'vaarta' shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya he, yadhyapi yah shabd purnataya arthshaastra kaa dyotak nahin
 Kautilya has said three parts of the dialogue - agriculture, commerce and animal husbandry, from which often the profession or livelihood was earned
 manu, yajyavlky aadi shaastrakaron ne bhi in teen angon vaale vaartashastra ko sweekaar kiya he
 Shukracharya has also included Kusid in this dialogue as a means of instinct
 parantu arthshaastra ko sabhi shaastrakaron ne dandniti, raajnneeti athwa shashanvigyaan ke rup main hi varnit kiya he
 Therefore, it would be better to consider 'kautilya Arthashastra' as a book of politics and not a book of wealth
 vaise isamen kahin-kahin sampattishastra ke dhanotpaadan, dhanopbhog tathaa dhan-vinimay, dhan-vibhaajan aadi vishyon kii bhi praasangik charchaa kii gai he
 The opening verse of the first tribunal of 'kautilya Arthashastra' is going to throw more light in this regard: arthath-pracheen aacharyon ne prithvi jeetne or paalan ke upaay batalaane vaale jitne arthshaastra likhe hai, praayah un sabakaa saar lekar is ek arthshaastra kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 Where this quote explains the subject of economics, it also illuminates the truth that before the 'kautilya Arthashastra', many masters composed the Arthashastra, which was intended to propose measures for conquering the earth and its observance
 un aacharyon tathaa unke sampradaayon ke kuch naamon kaa nirdesan ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ main kiya gaya he, yadhyapi unki kritiyaan aaj uplabdh bhi nahin hotin
 This name is the following: arthshaastra ke in das sampradaayon ke aacharyon main praaia: sabhi ke sambandh main kuch-na-kuch gyaat he, parantu vishalaksh ke bare main bahut kam parichay praapt hota he
 It is very clear from these names that many great thinkers and philosophers got attention towards economics ethics and a bright literature was produced on this subject
 aaj vah sahitya lupt ho chukaa he
 Due to many foreign invasions and state revolutions, this literature has remained nameless, but whatever literature is residual indicates a wide economical tradition
 is arthshaastra main ek aisi shashan-paddati kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he jisamen raja yaa shaasha praja kaa kalyaan sampaadan karne ke liye shashan karata he
 The king cannot rule arbitrarily
 use mantriparishad kii sahaayta praapt karke hi praja par shashan karnaa hota he
 The state-priest is like a curse on the king, who can control the king if he is disinherited from the religious path and can force him to perform his duty
 sarvalokahitkaari raashtra kaa jo swaroop kautilya ko abhipret he, vah ‘arthshaastra’ ke nimnlikhit vachan se spasht he- That is, the happiness of the king is in the happiness of the people, it is in the interest of the people
 raja kaa apana priy kuch nahin he, praja kaa priy hi uskaa priy he
 Around 400 CE, Kamandaka wrote an Arthashastra based on Kautilya's Arthashastra, a poetic form divided into 20 cantos called Kamandikeya Nitisara
 yah naitikta or videsh-niti ke siddhanton par bhi vichaar karata he
 The ethics of Somdev Suri, the short economics of Hemachandra, the Yuktikalpataru of Bhoja, the Venus of Venus, etc
 are some other well-known economics, which can also be counted under texts explaining the practical side of ethics

 The existence of another sophisticated script like Brahmi or the natural tendency to write from left to right of the country may have been the reason for the extinction of this script

 The name Kharoshthi is in the list of 64 scripts mentioned in Lalitavistar

 Its promotion mainly in the territory occupied by Iran of India, the use of ancient Persian scripts and the scriptural words derived from it in the records of Ashoka, the absence of ellipses, the existence of Kharoshthi letters with Brahmi letters on Iranian hurt coins and some of the Kharoshthi characters
 Equivalence with armae varna and the emergence of armae varna from many are nutrients of this belief

 Broadly, it points to a movement that envisages "a world where, to the extent possible, the poor and those on the verge of poverty, not only debt but high savings including savings, insurance and fund transfers The appropriate quality of financial services should be permanently accessible
 " In general, promoters of micro-finance believe that such access helps the poor to come out of poverty

 But the fixed expenses for processing any amount of loans will be quite high: eg, determining potential customers, their repayment prospects and collateral; Administration of outstanding debts, recovery from defaulting customers etc
 While lending or taking a deposit, a profit-free situation has to be established, below which banks have to bear losses on every transaction
 garib log, saamanyat: is rekha se neeche jivan basar karte hai
 Further, most poor people do not have assets that the bank can take on collateral as collateral
 jaise ki harnando di soto or duusare arthshaastriyon ke dastavejon main vyapak rup se darj kiya gaya he, vikasshil duniya main unke paas bhale hi apni zamin ho, lekin us par unka swatvadhikaar haq nahin hota he

 Because of these difficulties, when poor people borrow, they often depend on their relatives or local moneylenders, even if their interest rates are very high

 It is estimated that the industry will need US $ 250 billion to provide capital to all the poor people in need

 Probably influenced by traditional Western ideology about usury, the role of the traditional moneylender, especially in the early stages of modern micro-finance, was severely criticized

 Modern micro-finance emerged in the 1970s, with a greater orientation towards private sector solutions
 This was evidenced by the evidence that state-owned development banks in the developing world, in fact, ignored their development-oriented goals
 While doing that, she failed
 However, the government officials of many countries have different ideologies and do not desist from interfering in micro-finance markets

 Stuart Rutherford, in his recently published book The Poor and Their Money, has mentioned a variety of needs: garib log, apni zaruuratein puri karne kii disha main, khaas taur se vibhinn prakaar ke nakad rahit mulya taiyaar karne or vinimay dwaara, aksar srujanaatmak or sahyogi tareeqe dhund pate hai

 "and in the 1990s," micro-finance started to grow as an industry "
 In the 2000s, the goal of the micro-finance industry is to meet unmet demand in a big way and reduce poverty
 role playing
 While considerable progress has been made in the last few decades to develop a viable, commercial micro-finance sector, before the industry is able to meet the plethora of worldwide demand, it faces many problems, The solution is not yet done
 sudrudh vanijyik vyashti-vitt udyog kaa nirmaan karne main baadhaaen yaa chunautiyaan is prakaar hai: • Inappropriate funding of donors • viniman or jamaarashi sweekaar karanevaali vyashti-vitt sansthaaon kaa karaab paryvekshan • a number of micro-finance institutions that cater to savings, remittances or insurance needs • vyashti-vitt sansthaaon kii simit prabandh kshamta • Institutional inefficiencies • gramin, krishi unmukh vyashti-vitt paddatiyon kaa adhik prasar or angikaran karne kii zarurat
 Rutherford argues that the basic problem for poor people as wealth managers is to raise 'normally big' money
 Creating a new home means saving and protecting the building materials from years of years, until adequate means are available to start construction
 To reimburse children for school expenses such as uniforms, bribes etc
, to buy chickens and to raise money through sales

 Since these debts have to be repaid after the expenses are incurred, Rutherford calls it 'downward savings'

” Due to the work of Rutherford, Wright and others, businessmen have had to rethink one important aspect of the micro-credit precedent: that the poor get out of poverty by borrowing, setting up small enterprises and increasing their income

 The authors counted the accounts of about 665 million customers of more than 3,000 organizations serving more people than those served by commercial banks; Out of these accounts, 120 million accounts were held in institutions which are generally considered to be micro-finance institutions
