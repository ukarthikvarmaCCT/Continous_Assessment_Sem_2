 Kautilya's 'arthashastra' is an important work of political principles
 is sambandh main yah prashn uthta he ki kautilya ne apni pustak kaa naam 'arthshaastra' kyon rakhaa? prachinkaal main 'arthshaastra' shabd kaa prayog ek vyapak arth main hota tha
 Under this, the study of political science, theology, economics, law etc
 was originally done
 acharya kautilya kii drushti main raajnneeti shaastra ek swatantra shaastra he or anvikshiki, trayee tathaa vaarta env kanoon aadi uski shakhaayen hai
 The entire society is protected by politics or penal system or only the protected subjects can follow their duties
 us samay arthshaastra ko raajnneeti or prashasan kaa shaastra mana jaataa tha
 There is a context in this connection in the Mahabharata, in which Arjuna is considered an expert on economics
 nishchit rup se kautilya kaa arthshaastra bhi rajshastra ke rup main liya gaya hoga, yon usne arth kii kai vyakhyaayein kii hai
 Kautilya has said - Manushayanam vritirartha, that is to say, the meaning of the livelihood of human beings
 arthshaastra kii vyakhya karte hue usne kaha he—tasya pruthivya laabhpalnopaayah shaastramarth-shastramiti
 Thus, it is also clear that 'economics' includes principles related to both the polity and the economy
 vastutah kautilya 'arthshaastra' ko keval rajvyavastha or arthvyavastha kaa shaastra kahana upyukt nahin hoga
 In fact, it is the scripture related to economy, state, law, social system and religious system
 kautilya ke 'arthshaastra' ke purv or bhi kai arthshaastron kii rachana kii gayi thi, yadhyapi unki pandulipiyaan uplabdh nahin hai
 In India, since ancient times, efforts have been made for the combination and combination of meaning, work and religion and for this there are detailed discussions in the scriptures, memories and Puranas
 kautilya ne bhi 'arthshaastra' main arth, kaam or dharm kii prapti ke upayon kii vyakhya kii he
 In the 'kamasutra' of Vatsyayan, sources have been composed in relation to the meaning, religion and work
 apane purv arthshaastron kii rachana kii baat swayan kautilya ne bhi sweekaar kiya he
 In his 'arthashastra' he has mentioned Acharya Vrihaspati, Bharadwaja, Shukracharya, Parashar, Pishun, Vishalaksha etc
 in many references
 kautilya ke purv anek aacharyon ke granthon kaa namakaran dandniti ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 It seems that Kautilya's earlier scriptures were called Dandaniti and were similar to Arthashastra
 parantu jaisaa ki anek vidwaanon ne sweekaar kiya he ki dandniti or arthshaastra donon samroop nahin hai
 U
 N
 According to Ghoshal's statement, Arthashastra is a more comprehensive scripture, whereas Dandaniti is only its branch
 kautilya ke paashchaat likhe gayi shaastra 'nitishastra' ke naam se vikhyath hue, jaise kaamandak nitisar
 By the way, many scholars have considered economics more comprehensive than ethics
 parantu, adhikansh vidwaanon kii raay main nitishastra or arthshaastra donon samroop hai tathaa donon ke vishay kshetra bhi ek hi hai
 Kamandaka himself has considered ethics and economics to be identical
 uparyukt vivechan se yah spasht he ki kautilya ke 'arthshaastra' ke purv or uske baad bhi 'arthshaastra' jaise shastron kii rachana kii gayi
 In this regard, there are a large number of scholars who believe that Kautilya was not the creator of 'arthashastra'
 aise vidwaanon main paashchaatya vidwaanon kii sankhya zyada he
 Stan, Jolly, Winterneese and Keith are exponents of this type of thought

 bhandarkar ne bhi iskaa samarthan kiya he
 Bhandarkar has said that Patanjali did not mention Kautilya in the Mahabhashya
 'arthshaastra' ke rachayita ke rup main kautilya ko nahin manyata denevaalon ne apane mat ke samarthan main nimnlikhit tark prastut kiye hai— It is clearly written at the end of the book- saath hi yah bhi likhaa gaya he: This incident is discussed in Vishnu Purana as follows: ‘nitisar’ ke karta kaamandak ne bhi ghatana kii pushti karte hue likhaa he: It is clear from these quotes that Vishnugupta and Kautilya were the same person
 ‘arthshaastra’ main hi dwitiya adhikaran ke dasham adhyay ke ant main pustak ke rachayita kaa naam ‘kautilya’ bataaya gaya he: By writing 'kautilyan Kritam Shastra' at the beginning of the book and 'iti Kautiliyearthastra' at the end of each chapter, the author has made his' Kautilya name more famous
 jahaan-jahaan anya aacharyon ke mat kaa pratipaadan kiya he, ant main ‘iti kautilya’ arthath kautilya kaa mat he-is tarah kahkar kautilya naam ke liye apana adhik pakshpaat pradarshit kiya he
 But it is absolutely undisputed that Vishnugupta and Kautilya were integral persons
 uttarkalin dandi kavi ne ise acharya vishnugupt naam se yadi kaha he, to banbhatta ne ise hi kautilya naam se pukaara he
 The statement of both is that this Acharya composed 'dandaniti' or 'arthashastra'
 panchatantra main isi acharya kaa naam chanakya diya gaya he, jo arthshaastra kaa rachayita he
 In the poet visakhadatta-praneeth well-known drama Mudrarakshas, chanakya is sometimes referred to as Kautilya and sometimes Vishnugupta
 ‘arthshaastra’ kii rachana ‘shashan-vidhi’ ke rup main pratham maury samraat chandragupta ke liye kii gai
 Therefore, it is appropriate to consider the period of its creation as the period of the emperor Chandragupta

 ’’ in shabdon se spasht he ki acharya ne isaki rachana raajnneeti-shaastra tathaa visheshtya shashan-prabandh kii vidhi ke rup main kii
 Seeing the table of contents of economics, it is well proved that it is a mistake to call it the book of economics nowadays
 pratham adhikaran ke prarambh main hi swayan acharya ne ise 'dandniti' naam se suchit kiya he
 Shukracharya has described Dandaniti as such an important discipline that it has assumed the presence of all other disciplines - because according to the dictation of 'shastren Rakshe Deshe Shastraschhinta Pravartate', there can be concern or practice of other scriptures in the country, well protected and protected by weapons

 The term 'dialogue' has been used for what is now called economics, although the term is not entirely indicative of economics
 kautilya ne vaarta ke teen ang kahe hai - krishi, vaanijya tathaa pashu-paalan, jinase praaia: vritti yaa jeevika kaa uparjan kiya jaataa tha
 The scholars of Manu, Yajnavalkya etc
 have also accepted the dialogue of these three parts
 peeche shukracharya ne is vaarta main kuseed ko bhi vritti ke saadhan-rup main sammilit kar diya he
 But economics has been described by all the scholars as politics, politics or governance
 at: ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ ko raajnneeti kii pustak samajhnaa hi thik hoga na ki sampattishastra kii pustak
 By the way, in some cases, the relevant topics of wealth creation, wealth and wealth exchange, wealth division etc
 have also been discussed
 ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ ke pratham adhikaran kaa praarambhik vachan is sambandh main adhik prakaash daalane vaala he: That is, this one economics has been created by taking the summary of all the economics which the ancient masters have written to win the earth and show the ways of rearing
 yah uddhran arthshaastra ke vishay ko jahaan spasht karata he, vahaan is satya ko bhi prakashit karata he ki ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ se purv anek aacharyon ne arthshaastra kii rachanaaen kin, jinka uddeshy prithvi-vijay tathaa uske paalan ke upayon kaa pratipaadan karnaa tha
 Some names of those Acharyas and their sects have been directed in 'kautilya Arthashastra', although their works are not available even today
 ye naam nimnlikhit he: In the tenants of these ten sects of economics, almost everything is known in relation to everyone, but very little introduction is found about Vishalaksha
 in naamon se yah to atyant spasht he ki arthshaastra nitishastra ke prati anek mahaan vichaarkon tathaa darshanikon kaa dhyaan gaya or is vishay par ek ujjwal sahitya kaa nirmaan hua
 Today that literature is lost
 anek videshi akramanon tathaa rajyakrantiyon ke kaaran is sahitya kaa naam-maatr shesh rah gaya he, parantu jitna bhi sahitya avshisht he vah ek vistrut arthshaastreey parampara kaa sanket karata he
 In this Arthashastra, such a system of governance has been enacted in which the king or ruler rules for the welfare of the subjects
 raja swechhachari hokar shashan nahin kar saktaa
 He has to rule over the subjects only after getting the help of the Council of Ministers
 rajya-purohit raja par ankush ke samaan he, jo dharm-maarg se chyut hone par raja kaa niyantran kar saktaa he or use kartavya-paalan ke liye vivash kar saktaa he
 Kautilya, which is the form of an all-round nation, is clear from the following word of 'arthashastra' - arthath-praja ke sukh main raja kaa sukh he, prajake hit main uskaa hit he
 The king has nothing but his own love, the beloved of the people is his favorite
 400 ri0 san ke lagbhag kaamandak ne kautilya ke arthshaastra ke aadhaar par kaamandakeey nitisar naamak 20 sargon main vibhakt kavyarup ek arthshaastra likhaa tha
 It also considers the principles of ethics and foreign policy
 somdev suri kaa nitivakyamrita, hemachandra kaa laghu arthniti, bhoj kaa yuktikalpataru, shukr kaa shukraniti aadi kuch duusare suprasiddh arthshaastra hai, jinako nitishastra ke vyaavhaarik paksh kii vyakhya karne vaale granthon ke antargat bhi gina ja saktaa he

 Jain philosophy is an ancient Indian philosophy
 isamen ahimsa ko sarvocch sthaan diya gaya he
 According to the belief of Jainism, 24 Tirthankaras come to this earth from time to time to preach for the welfare of the fallen creatures in the world cycle
 lagbhag chhathi shatabdi i pus main antim tirthankar, bhagwaan mahavir ke dwaara jain darshan kaa punraran hua 
 In this, the authenticity of the Vedas was said to be false due to excess and inertia of rituals
 jain darshan ke anusaar jeev or karmo kaa yah sambandh anadi kaal se he
 When the living being completely frees these deeds from his soul, he himself becomes God
 lekin iske liye use samyak purusharth karnaa padataa he
 This is the fundamental belief of Jainism
 satya kaa anusandhan karne vaale 'jain' shabd kii vyutpatti ‘jin’ se maani gai he, jiskaa arth hota he- vijeta arthath vah vyakti jisane ichchhaaon evam man par vijay praapt karke hameshaa ke liye sansar ke avaagaman se mukti praapt kar lee he
 The Jains who followed the teachings of these people and their communal principles became famous as Jain philosophy
 jain darshan ‘arhat darshan’ ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 There were twenty-four Tirthankaras in Jainism, the first being Rishabhdev and the last Mahavira
 inke kuch tirthakaron ke naam rugveda main bhi milte hai, jisase inaki pracheenta pramanit hoti he
 The major texts of Jain philosophy are written in Prakrit language
 baad main kuch jain viddhanon ne sanskrit main bhi granth likhe
 Among them, the Tattva Sutra composed by Acharya Umaswamy around 100 AD is very important
 vah pehla granth he jisamen sanskrit bhashaa ke madhyam se jain siddhanton ke sabhi angon kaa purna rup se varnan kiya gaya he
 After this, many Jain scholars composed grammar, philosophy, poetry, drama etc
 in Sanskrit
 sankshep main inke siddhanth is prakaar hai- Dravya is one in which the qualities and synonyms are - 'gunaparayaivad Dravyaam'
 gun swaroop dharm he or paryaay aaagantuk dharm
 There are two distinctions of these religions — emotional affective
 swaroopadharmon ke bina dravya kaa astitva sambhav nahin
 It is made of materials
 dravya sat hai; kyonki usamen satta ke teenon lakshan utpatti, vyay or nityata maujuud he
 There are two forms of matter - Astikaya and Anastikaya
 anastikaay ke amoort hone se isamen keval kaal kii hi gananaa hoti he, jabaki astikaay main do prakaar ke dravya hai- jeev tathaa ajeev
 Conscious matter is a creature or soul
 sansaarik dasha main yahi aatma jeev kehalaati he
 The organism has vitality and physical, mental, and sensory power, in which, by the effect of work, there are ceremonial, decaying, decaying, communal and ecological - these five expressions are combined with prana
 dravya ke rup badalane par yahi ‘bhavadashapann praan’ pudgal kehalaata he
 In this way, only animals with puddles are called sansari
 jain darshananusaar jeev nity evam swayamprakash he
 Due to 'avidya', he is bound in bondage
 is prakaar jeev ke do bhed hai- sansari evam mukt
 Again, the two distinctions of the world are real and movable, in which the movable-earthy, decaying, windy and fiery ones
 astikaay dravya kaa doosraa tatva ‘ajeev’ he, jiske paanch bhed hai-dharm, adharm, akaash, pudgal or kaal
 In Jain philosophy, the main eight distinctions of Karma are told - Gyanavarna, Darshanabdhana, Vedani, Mohini, Age, Naam, Gotra and Antaraya
 jainiyon ke anusaar karm paudgalik arthath dhul ke kan ke samaan jad padaarth hai
 They arise from the actions, desires and desires of mind, body and speech inspired by desire, malice and confusion
 karm ke mukhya rup se do bhed hai- There are four distinctions of exponential karma - isi prakaar aghaateey karm ke bhi chaar bhed hai- These are the reasons for the eight types of karma bonding
 jeev ke bandhan kaa mul kaaran dooshit manobhaav hai
 Due to diseases, the organism is invaded by the pudgal is said to be a binding element
 jeev ke pudgalon main pravesh se pehle ‘bhavasrav’ paidaa hota he, jo ki jeev kaa vaastavik swaroop nasht kar detaa he or jeev bandhan main fas jaataa he
 'moksha' is the liberation of an organism from the root
 yah moksh do prakaar kaa he- bhavamoksh or dravyamoksh
 Bhavmoksha is liberation
 yah vaastavik moksh se pehle kii avasthaa he
 Four exponential karmas perish in it
 iske baad hi aghaateey karmon kaa naash hone par dravya-moksh bhi praapt ho jaataa he
 According to Jains, to attain salvation, it is necessary to have twelve redirections, which are as follows - Anitya, Asharana, Samsara, Ekatva, Otherness, Ashuchi, Asrava, Sanvar, Nirajra, Loka, Bodhidurbhatva and Dharmanaopraksha
 jainon kii gyanamimasaa tatvamimasaa ke samaan hi swatantra satta rakhti he
 The number of authentic source evidences of Jnanamimamsa is three in Jain philosophy - direct, guess and word
 jain darshanik ‘syadwad’ arthath ‘saptabhanginay’ kaa pratipaadan karte hai- According to this, our knowledge cannot be called absolute truth
 gyaan sadaiv aapekshit satya hi hota he There is a subtle discussion in Jain philosophy
 iskaa ek mukhya kaaran yah he ki iskaa prarupan sarvajna-sarvdarshee, vitaragi praani maatr ke hitecchhuk, anant anukampaa yukt jineshwar bhagwanton dwaara hua he
 By following whose path, each soul can do his welfare
 apane sukh or dukh kaa kaaran jeev swayan he, koi doosraa use dukhi kar hi nahin saktaa
punarjanm, purvajanm, bandha-moksh aadi jindharm maanata he
 Ahimsa, truth, tenacity is the root of this religion
 jain granthon main saat tattvon kaa varnan miltaa hai
 These are jain darshan is sansar ko kisi bhagwaan dwaara banaaya hua sweekaar nahin karata he, apitu shaashvat maanata he
 Whatever happens at birth and death, there is no universal authority to control it
 jeev jaise karm karata he, un ke parinaam swarup achche yaa bure falon ko bhugatne k liye vah manushya, narak dev, evam tiryanch yoniyon main janm maran karata rahata he

 The qualitative methods only produce information on the specific studied cases and any general conclusions in addition are just hypotheses

 Until the 1970s, the phrase 'qualitative research' was used only to refer to a subject in anthropology or sociology
 1970 or 1980 dashak ke dauraan gunatmak anusandhan kaa istemaal anya vishyon ke liye bhi kiya jane laga or yah shaikshik adhyayan, saamaajik kaary adhyayan, mahila adhyayan, viklaangata adhyayan, soochna adhyayan, prabandhan adhyayan, nursing seva adhyayan, rajnatik vigyaan, manovigyaan, sanchaar adhyayan or kai anya kshetron main anusandhan kaa mahatvapurn prakaar ban gaya
 During this period qualitative research began to take place in consumer products, where researchers began to investigate new consumer products and product positioning / advertising opportunities

 After a flurry of criticisms from the quantitative side in the late 1980s and 1990s, new methods of qualitative research developed to address the perceived problems regarding reliability and uncertain methods of data analysis
 During the same decade, there was a slowdown in traditional media advertising spending, leading to increased interest in making research related to advertising more effective

 Second, the role or position of the researcher is given more serious attention
 yah is vajah se ki gunatmak anusandhan main shodhakarta dwaara 'tatasth' yaa mimasaatmak sthiti apnaane kii sambhavyata ko vyavhaar main or / yaa darshanik rup se adhik samasyatmak mana gaya he
 Therefore qualitative researchers are often encouraged to consider their role in the research process and clarify it in their analysis
 tisare, jahaan gunatmak data vishleshan vistrut vividh rup grahan kar saktaa he, vahiin yah maatraatmak shodh se bhashaa, sanket or taatpary par sankendran tathaa saath hi, atisaral or algaav ke bajaay samgr or praasangik vishleshnatmak drushtikon se bhinn ho jaataa he
 Nevertheless, a systematic and transparent approach to analysis is almost always considered essential for preciseness
 udhaaharan ke liye, kai gunatmak vidhiyon main shodhakartaaon ko dhyanpurvak data code karne or ek susangat or vishwasaneey tareeke se vishyon par vichaar or pralekhith karne kii apeksha kii jaati he
 Perhaps the more traditional distinction of qualitative and quantitative research used in the social sciences is in the use of qualitative methods for observational purposes or for the interpretation of confounding quantitative results, while quantitative methods are used to test hypotheses
 
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki saamagree kii vaidhata kii sthapana ko - ki kya ve un maanon ko maapti hai jinhen shodhakarta samajhataa he ki ve maap rahi hai? - ek gunatmak anusandhan ke takat ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Whereas quantitative methods have been seen as providing more representative, reliable and accurate measurements through focused hypotheses, measurement tools, and experimental mathematics
 iske vipareet, gunatmak data ko aam taur par graph yaa ganitiya sandarbh main pradarshit karnaa mushkil he
 Qualitative research is often used for policy and program evaluation research because it can answer certain key questions more efficiently and effectively than a quantitative approach
 yah vishesh rup se yah samajhane ke liye he ki kaise or kyon kuch parinaam hasil hue hai balki praasangikta, anpekshit prabhaavon or kaaryakramon ke prabhaav ke bare main mahatvapurn sawaalon kaa jawaab dene ke liye bhi, jaise ki: kya apekshaayen uchit thim? kya prakriyaaon ne apekshanuroop kaam kiya? kya pramukh ghatak apane karttavyon ko puraa karne main sakasham the? kya kaarykram kaa koi avaanchit prabhaav rahaa tha? gunatmak drushtikon main pratikriyaaon kii adhik vividhta ke maukey anumat karne ke alaava anusandhan prakriya ke dauraan hi nae vikaas yaa muddon ko anukool banane kii kshamta kii suvidha maujuud he
 While qualitative research can be expensive and time consuming to operate, many fields apply qualitative techniques that have been specifically developed to produce more abstract, economical and timely results
 a formal example of these adaptations is rapid rural assessment, but many more exist
 gunatmak shodhakarta data sangrahan ke liye kai alag drushtikon apana sakate hai, jaise ki buniyadi siddhant abhyaas, aakhyaan, kahani sunaanaa, shastreey nrivanshavigyaan yaa pratichhaya
 kaary-anusandhan yaa kaaryakarta-network siddhant jaise anya suvyavasthit drushtikon main bhi gunatmak vidhiyaan shithil rup se maujuud rahati hai
 The collected data format can include interviews and group discussions, observation and reflective field notes, various texts, pictures and other material
 gunatmak anusandhan parinaamon ko vyavasthit tathaa report karne ke liye aksar data ko pattern main praathmik aadhaar ke rup main vargeekrut karata he
 Qualitative researchers generally resort to the following methods to gather information: participatory observation, non-participatory observation, field notes, reflective journals, structured interviews, semi-structured interviews, unstructured interviews and analysis of documents and materials
 sahabhaagita or prekshan ke tareeqe setting dar setting vyapak rup se bhinn ho sakate hai
 Participatory observation is a tactical learning strategy, not a single method of observation
 In participatory observation, researchers typically become members of a culture, group, or setting, and adopt roles consistent with that setting
 aisa karne kaa uddeshy shodhakarta ko samskruti kii prathaen, prayojan or bhaawanaaon ke prati nearesth antardrushti kaa laabh uplabdh karana he
 It is argued that researchers' ability to understand culture experiences may be inhibited if they observe without partaking
 kuch vishisht gunatmak vidhiyaan hai focus samoohon kaa upyog or pramukh suchak saakshaatkaar
 focus samooh takanic main shaamil hota he ek madhyasth jo kisi vishisht vishay par chaynit vyaktiyon ke bich ek choti charchaa ko yojit karata he
 It is a particularly popular method of market research and testing new initiatives with users / activists
 gunatmak anusandhan kaa ek paaramparik or vishesh swaroop sangyanatmak pareekshan yaa praayogic pareekshan kehalaata he jiskaa upyog maatraatmak surveykshan madon ke vikaas ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Survey items are used on study participants to test the reliability and validity of the items
 shaikshik saamaajik vigyaan main aksar istemaal kiye jane vaale gunatmak anusandhan drushtikon main nimnlikhit shaamil hai: The most common analysis of qualitative data is the observer effect
 arthath, visheshgy yaa darshak prekshak data kii jaanch karte hai, ek dharna banane ke zarie use samajhate hai or apane prabhaav ko sanrachanaatmak or kabhi-kabhi maatraatmak rup main report karte hai
 Coding is an interpretive technique in the sense that both streamlines data and provides the means to introduce those inflections in certain quantitative methods
 adhikansh koding main vishleshak ko data ke pathan or uske khandon ko simaankit karnaa padataa he
 Each section is labeled with a "code" - usually a word or short phrase, that describes how the associated data segments inform the objectives of the research
 jab koding puraa ho jaataa he, vishleshak nimna ke mishran ke madhyam se report taiyaar karata he: code ke prachlan kaa saransh, vibhinn mul strot / sandarbhon ke paar sambandhit code main samaantaaon or vibhinnataaon par charchaa, yaa ek yaa adhik kodon ke bich sambandh kii tulana
 Some highly structured qualitative data are usually coded without additional segmentation of content
 in maamalon main, code ko aksar data kii upree parat ke rup main lagu kiya jaataa he
 Quantitative analysis of these codes is typically the capstone analytical step for this type of qualitative data
 kabhi-kabhi samakaleen gunatmak data vishleshan computer program dwaara samarthit hote hai
 These programs do not remove the explanatory nature of coding, but rather serve the purpose of enhancing the analyst's efficiency in data collection / retrieval and applying code to data
 kai program sampadan or koding ke sanshodhan kshamta kii peshkash karte hai, jo kaam saajha karne, sahakarmi samiksha or data ke punaravarti pareekshan ko anumat karte hai
 a frequent criticism of the coding method is that it attempts to convert qualitative data into quantitative data, thereby eliminating the diversity, richness, and personal nature of the data
 vishleshak puri tarah apane code kii paribhaasha ke pratipaadan or unhen antarnihit data ke saath bakubi jodate hue, kodon kii maatr suchi se anupasthit samruddhi ko waapas laakar is aalochana kaa jawaab dete hai
 Some qualitative datasets are analyzed without coding
 yahaan ek saamaanya vidhi he prayavarti pruthakkaran, jahaan dataseton kaa saransh nikaala jaataa he or phir unako sankshipt kiya jaataa he
 The end result is a more consistent abstract that is difficult to identify accurately without the preceding stages of distillation
 prayavarti pruthakkaran kii ek lagaataar kii jane vaali aalochana yah he ki antim nishkarsh antarnihit data se kai guna hat kar hota he
 While it is true that poor preliminary summaries will certainly produce a flawed final report, qualitative analysts may respond to this criticism
 ve koden vidhi kaa upyog karne vaale logon kii tarah, prayek saransh charan ke peeche tark ke dastavejikaran dwaara, jahaan bayaan shaamil hon data se or jahaan bayaan shaamil naa hon, madhyavarti saranshon se udaahranon kaa hawala dete hue aisa karte hai
 Some techniques rely on the leverage of computers to scan and sort large sets of qualitative data
 apane sarvaadhik buniyadi str par, yantric takanic data ke bheetar shabd, vaakyansh, yaa token ke sanyog kii ginati par nirbhar hote hai
 Often referred to as content analysis, the outputs of these techniques are responsive to many advanced statistical analyzes
 yantric takanic vishesh rup se kuch paridrishyon ke liye adhik upyukt hai
 One such scenario is for large datasets that are simply not possible for humans to effectively analyze, or their analysis is cost prohibitive compared to the value of the information contained in them
 ek anya paridrishy he jab ek dataset kaa mukhya mulya us seemaa tak he jahaan vah "laal jhanda" yaa "haraa jhanda" liye hue he
 a continuing criticism of mechanical technology is the lack of a human translator
 or jahaan in tareekon ke swami kuch maanviya nirnyon kii nakal karne ke liye atyaadhunik software likhane main sakasham hai, "vishleshan" kaa adhikansh hissaa bina maanav ke he
 Analysts respond by certifying the relative value of their methods, either a) by hiring and training human teams to analyze the data, or b) by leaving data untouched, leaving data untouched
 
 samakaleen gunatmak anusandhan anya baton ke saath-saath vaidhata, niyantran, data vishleshan, sattamimasaa or gyaan-mimasaa kii sankalpanaatmak or vaicharik chintaaon ko prabhavit karne vaale kai alag nidarshanon se kiya jaataa he
 Research conducted in the last 10 years has a specific inclination towards more explanatory, postmodern and critical practices
 Guba and Lincoln identify five major paradigms of contemporary qualitative research: deterministic, postmodern, critical theory, constructivist and participatory / cooperative
 Each of the paradigms listed by Guba and Lincoln, value-epistemology, intended research action, control of research process / results, relationship with the foundations of truth and knowledge, validity, text representation and voice of researcher / participants
 And are characterized by axiomatic differences of conformity with other paradigms
 vishesh rup se, swayansiddhi main vah seemaa shaamil hai jahaan tak nidarshanatmak chintaaen "un tareeqon se ek duusare ke prati baad main thik baithai ja sakati hai, jo donon ke ek saath abhyaas ko sambhav kar sake"
 nishchayatmak or nishchayottar nidarshan swayansiddh manyataon ko saajha karte hai, lekin bade paimaane par aalochanatmak, rachnawadi or sahabhaagi nidarshanon ke saath athulaneey hai
 Similarly, critical, constructivist and participatory paradigms are axiomatic on some issues
 gunatmak anusandhan kaa ek kendriya mudda he vaidhata 
 vaidhata ko sthapit karne ke kai alag tareeqe hai, jinamein shaamil hai: sadsy jaanch, saakshaatkaarkarta pushtikaran, sahakarmi se jaankaree lenaa, lambey samay tak viniyojan, nakaaratmak maamla vishleshan, lekhankankshmata, pushtikarnakshmata, baraabar samajhnaa or santulan
 inamen se adhikansh tareekon ko linkan or guba ne gadha he, yaa kam se kam vyapak rup se varnit kiya he
 By the late 1970s, several leading journals started publishing qualitative research articles and several new journals emerged which published only qualitative research studies and articles about qualitative research methods
 1980 or 1990 dashak main, nai gunatmak anusandhan patrikaon kaa dhyaan sankendran vividh vishyak ho gaya, jo gunatmak anusandhan ke paaramparik mul yatha nrivigyaan, samajashaastra or darshan se pare dekhne lageen
 The new millennium saw a dramatic increase in the number of journals specializing in the field of qualitative research, including the introduction of at least one new qualitative research journal per year

 Vedanta is a branch of Jnana Yoga that motivates a person towards the attainment of knowledge
 iskaa mukhya strot upanishad he jo veda grantho or aranyak granthon kaa saar samajhe jate hai
 The Upanishads are the last part of Vedic literature, hence it is called Vedanta
 karmkand or upasna kaa mukhyat: varnan mantra or brahmanon main he, gyaan kaa vivechan upanishdon main
 'vedanta' literally means 'the end of the Vedas'
 veydant kii teen shakhaayen jo sabase zyada jaani jaati hai ve hai: advait veydant, vishisht advait or dwait
 Adi Shankaracharya, Ramanuja and Shri Madhwacharya, who are considered to be the promoters of these three branches respectively, besides these there are other branches of Gyan Yoga
 ye shakhaayen apane pravartakon ke naam se jaani jaati hai jinamein bhaskar, vallabh, chaitanya, nimbarak, vachaspati mishra, sureshwar or vigyaan bhikshu
 Among the major Vedantis that have taken place in modern times, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Swami Vivekananda, Arvind Ghosh, Swami Shivananda Raja Rammohan Roy and Raman Maharishi are notable
 ye aadhunik vichaarak advait veydant shakha kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 The promoters of other Vedantos have also propagated their ideas well in India but they are little known outside India
 ‘veydant’ kaa shabdic arth he ‘vedon kaa ant’
 Initially, the word 'vedanta' was used for the Upanishads, but later on the principles of the Upanishads formed the basis, the word 'vedanta' started being used for those who developed it
 upanishdon ke liye 'veydant' shabd ke prayog ke praayah teen kaaran diye jate hai :- According to Acharya Udayveer Shastri, the term 'vedanta' refers to- upar kaha ja chukaa he ‘veydant’ shabd multah upanishdon ke liye prayukt hota tha
 We have many Upanishads related to different codes and their branches
 jinamein pramukh tathaa pracheen hai - ish, ken, kath, mundak, mandukya, taittiriya, aitarey, chaandogya tathaa brihadaaranyak
 There is a lot of similarity between the philosophical principles of these Upanishads, but there also seems to be opposition in many places
 kaalaantar main yah aavashyaktaa anubhav kii gai ki virdohi prathit hone vaale vichaaron main samanvay sthapit kar sarvasammat upadeshon kaa sankalan kiya jaye
 To fulfill this need, Badarayana Vyasa composed the Brahmasutra which is also known as Vedanta Sutra, Shareerakasutra, Shareerakamimansa or Uttaraimamsa
 isamen upanishdon ke siddhanton ko atyant sankshep main, sutara rup main sankalit kiya gaya he
 Due to being too succinct, there is ambiguity in the formulas themselves and it is not possible to understand them without commentary or commentary
 isiilie anek bhashyakaron ne apane-apane bhashyon dwaara inke abhipraay ko spasht karne kaa praytn kiya kintu is spashtikaran main unka apana-apana drushtikon tha or isiliye unamem paryaapt matbhed he
 Each tried to prove that his commentary clarifies the true meaning of the Brahmasutras
 faltah sabhi bhashyakaar ek-ek veydant sampradaay ke pravartak ban gayi
 Prominent among them are Shankar's monotheism, Ramanuja's specificism, Madhva's dualism, Nimbark's dualism and Vallabh's puritanism
 in bhashyon ke anantar in bhashyon par tikaayen tathaa tikaaon par tikaaon kaa kram chalaa
 Many independent texts were also written to confirm the opinion of their community, due to which the literature of Vedanta became very large
 aitihaasik rup se kisi guru ke liye acharya banane / samajhe jane ke liye veydant kii pustakon par tikaayen yaa bhashya likhane padate hai
 These books include three important books, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad-gītā and the Brahmasutra, which are called Prasthanatrayi
 tadnusaar aadi shankaracharya, ramanuj or madhwacharya teenon ne in teen mahatvapurn pustakon par vishisht rachanaayen di hai
 The ideas revealed in the three texts can be interpreted in many ways
 isi kaaran se brahm, jeev tathaa jagat ke sambandh main anek mat upasthit kiye gaye or is tarah veydant ke anek rupo kaa nirmaan hua tha | Gaudapada and his follower Adi Shankaracharya consider Brahma as the head and consider Jiva and Jagat as integral to him
 unke anusaar tatv ko utpatti or vinaash se rahit hona chahie
 The perishable world is non-existent, the living being is not the same as it appears
 jaagrath or swapnavasthaon main jeev jagat main rahata he parantu sushupti main jeev prapanch gyanshunya chetnavastha main rahata he
 This proves that the pure form of the organism should be like sushumpti
 sushupti avasthaa anitya he at: isse pare turiyavastha ko jeev kaa shuddh rup mana jaataa he
 In this state there is no relation with the mortal world and the organism does not have to enter the mortal world again
 yah turiyavastha abhyaas se praapt hoti he
 When the knowledge of impenetration arises in Brahma-jiva-jagat, the world becomes absorbed in Jiva and Jiva
 teenon main vaastavik abhed hone par bhi agyaan ke kaaran jeev jagat ko apane se pruthak samajhataa he
 But like the dream world, the awakened world is also a fantasy of an organism
 bhed itnaa hi he ki swapn vyaktigat kalpana kaa parinaam he jabaki jaagrath anubhav-samshti-gat mahakalpana kaa
 Falsehood is proved in both of them when they know the dream
 parantu baudhon kii tarah veydant main jeev ko jagat kaa ang hone ke kaaran mithyaa nahin mana jaataa
 a creature experiencing falsehood is the ultimate truth, if he believes it to be false, all knowledge has to be considered false
 parantu jis rup main jeev sansar main vyavhaar karata he uskaa vah rup avashya mithyaa he
 Zoroastrian state of consciousness is zero pure state
 gyaata-gyey-gyaan kaa sambandh mithyaa sambandh he
 Beyond this, the organism attains its pure state of consciousness
 is avasthaa main bhed kaa lesh bhi nahin he kyonki bhed dwait main hota he
 This Advaita state is called Brahm
 tatv aseem hota he, yadi doosraa tatv bhi ho to pehle tatv kii seemaa ho jaaegi or simit ho jane se vah tatv buddhigamya hoga jisamen gyaata-gyey-gyaan kaa bhed pratibhasith hone lagegaa
 Experience testifies that all known objects are mortal
 at: yadi ham tatv ko anshwar maanate hai to hamen use advay, agyeya, shuddh chaitanya maananaa hi hoga
 By assuming such an element, we have to explain the resplendent state of the world with the help of discourse
 rassi main pratibhasith honevaale sarp kii tarah yah jagat na to sat he, na asat he
 Had it been true, it would never have been destroyed, if it had been immaterial, there would have been no experience of happiness or sorrow
 at: sat asat se vilakshan anivarchaneey avasthaa hi vaastavik avasthaa ho sakati he
 This ignorance has been rendered by the Upanishads as Neti
 agyaan bhav rup he kyonki isse vastu ke astitv kii uplabdhi hoti he, yah abhaav rup he, kyonki iskaa vaastavik rup kuch bhi nahin he
 This ignorance is considered the cause of the world
 agyaan kaa brahm ke saath kya sambandh he, iskaa sahi uttar kathin he parantu brahm apane shuddh nirgun rup main agyaan virahit he, kisi tarah vah bhavabhaav vilakshan agyaan se aavrutt hokar sagun ishwar kahalaane lagata he or is tarah sristikram chaalu ho jaataa he
 God has knowledge of his pure form, but an organism has to be enlightened through cultivation to gain knowledge of his Brahman form
 guru ke mukh se 'tatvamasi' kaa upadesh sunakar jeev 'ahan brahmasmi' kaa anubhav karata he
 At that stage, one sees the whole world as soulful and the whole world in itself because at that time there is no element apart from it
 isi avasthaa ko turiyavastha yaa moksh kehete hai
 Ramanujacharya said contrary to Shankar's view that God is an independent element, but the living is also true, not false
 ye jeev ishwar ke saath sambhddha hai
