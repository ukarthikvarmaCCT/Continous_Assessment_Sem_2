 lekin vahiin dalit varg apni duusari vot kaa istemaal karte hue saamaanya varg ke pratinidhi ko chunane se apni bhoomika nibhaa saktaa tha

 ambedkar is samjhaute se asamaadhani the, unhone gandhi ke is anshan ko achhuton ko unke raajnneetik adhikaron se vanchit karne or unhen unki maang se peeche hatane ke liye dawaab daalane ke liye gandhi dwaara khelaa gaya ek naatak qaraar diya

 He asked whether sufficient reasons existed for the establishment of Pakistan? And suggested that differences between Hindus and Muslims might have been possible to eradicate even with a less drastic step
 unhone likhaa he ki pakistan ko apane astitv kaa auchity siddh karnaa chaiye
 Communal issues have always been there even in countries like Canada, but even today the British and French live together, so can't Hindus and Muslims also live together

 Take the caste system itself, everyone says that Islam should be free from slavery and caste, while slavery exists and got support from Islam and Islamic countries
 jabaki quran main nihit gulaamon ke nyaay or maanviya upachaar ke bare main paigambar dwaara kiye gaye nuskhe prashansaneey hai, islam main aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo is abhishaap ke unmoolan kaa samarthan karata ho

 The human whipworm is a round worm that causes trichuriasis when it infects a human large intestine
 It is commonly known as the whipworm which refers to the shape of the worm; it looks like a whip with wider "handles" at the posterior end
 The female T
 trichiura produces 2,000–10,000 single-celled eggs per day
 Eggs are deposited from human feces to soil where, after two to three weeks, they become embryonated and enter the "infective" stage
 These embryonated infective eggs are ingested and hatch in the human small intestine exploiting the intestinal microflora as hatching stimulus
 This is the location of growth and molting
 The infective larvae penetrate the villi and continue to develop in the small intestine
 The young worms move to the ceacum and penetrate the mucosa and there they complete development to adult worms in the large intestine
 The life cycle from time of ingestion of eggs to development of mature worms takes approximately three months
 During this time, there may be limited signs of infection in stool samples due to lack of egg production and shedding
 The female T
 trichiura begin to lay eggs after three months of maturity
 Worms can live up to five years, during which time females can lay up to 20,000 eggs per day
 Recent studies using genome-wide scan revealed two quantitative trait loci on chromosome 9 and chromosome 18 may be responsible for genetic predisposition or susceptibility to infection of T
 trichiura by some individuals
 Trichuris trichiura has a narrow anterior esophageal end and shorter and thicker posterior anus
 These pinkish-white worms are threaded through the mucosa
 They attach to the host through their slender anterior end and feed on tissue secretions instead of blood
 Females are larger than males; approximately 35–50 mm long compared to 30–45 mm
 The females have a bluntly round posterior end compared to their male counterparts with a coiled posterior end
 Their characteristic eggs are barrel-shaped and brown, and have bipolar protuberances
 Infection occurs through ingestion of eggs and is more common in warmer areas
 Whipworms eggs are passed in the feces of infected persons, and if an infected person defecates outside or if untreated human feces as used as fertilizer, eggs are deposited on soil where they can mature into an infective stage
 Ingestion of these eggs "can happen when hands or fingers that have contaminated dirt on them are put in the mouth or by consuming vegetables or fruits that have not been carefully cooked, washed or peeled
" The eggs hatch in the small intestine, and then move into the wall of the small intestine and develop
 On reaching adulthood, the thinner end burrows into the large intestine and the thicker end hangs into the lumen and mates with nearby worms
 The females can grow to 50 mimi long
 Neither the male nor the female has much of a visible tail past the anus
 Whipworm usually infects patients also infected with Giardia, Entamoeba histolytica, Ascaris lumbricoides, and hookworms
 There is a worldwide distribution of Trichuris trichiura, with an estimated 1 billion human infections
 However, it is chiefly tropical, especially in Asia and, to a lesser degree, in Africa and South America
 Within the United States, infection is rare overall but may be common in the rural Southeast, where 2
2 million people are thought to be infected
 Poor hygiene is associated with trichuriasis as well as the consumption of shaded moist soil, or food that may have been fecally contaminated
 Children are especially vulnerable to infection due to their high exposure risk
 Eggs are infective about 2–3 weeks after they are deposited in the soil under proper conditions of warmth and moisture, hence its tropical distribution
 Whipworms develop when a dog swallows whipworm eggs, passed from an infected dog
 Symptoms may include diarrhea, anemia, and dehydration
 The dog whipworm is usually found in the US It is hard to detect at times, because the numbers of eggs shed are low, and they are shed in waves
 Centrifugation is the preferred method
 There are several preventives available by prescription from a veterinarian to prevent dogs from getting whipworm
 The cat whipworm is a rare parasite
 In Europe, it is represented mostly by Trichuris campanula, and in North America it is Trichuris serrata more often
 Whipworm eggs found in cats in North America must be differentiated from lungworms, and from mouse whipworm eggs just passing through
 The hygiene hypothesis suggests that various immunological disorders that have been observed in humans only within the last 100 years, such as Crohn's disease, or that have become more common during that period as hygienic practices have become more widespread, may result from a lack of exposure to parasitic worms during childhood
 The use of Trichuris suis ova by Weinstock, et al
, As a therapy for treating Crohn's disease and to a lesser extent ulcerative colitis are two examples that support this hypothesis
 There is also anecdotal evidence that treatment of inflammatory bowel disease with TSO decreases the incidence of asthma, allergy, and other inflammatory disorders
 Some scientific evidence suggests that the course of multiple sclerosis may be very favorably altered by helminth infection; bharat kii janaganana anusaar yah gaanv, tehsil sanbhal, jila muradabad, uttar pradesh main sthit he

 This quantum number expresses the shape of the electron orbit
 For a value of n, the value of l can be anything from 0 to n-1
 That is, for any value of n, there are total n values of l, just as the value of n expresses the electron's shell, similarly the value of the quantum number l expresses the electron's subshell, the s subfamily of l = 0, l = The p subset of 1, the f subscale of l = 3, is called 









 Similarly, l = 0,1,2, xxrep 8 
 for n = 4, ie, four subsets of n the shell will have s, p, d and f respectively
 The higher the value of s, p, d and f, the weaker the electron's bond with the nucleus

 We mainly use two types of tools for e-mail, one is e-mail client and the other web based e-mail service
 For e-mail in Hindi, they can be further divided into two types
 oski font aadhaarit tathaa unicode hindi aadhaarit
 do-ek saal pehle tak oski font aadhaarit sevaayen hi hamaare liye ek maatr vikalp ke rup main mauzood thi, jinamein ham shusha se lekar weboduniya tak ke bhinn bhinn font kaa upyog kar khush ho lete the ki ham hindi main i-mail kar le rahe hai
 But English is mandatory for the headers, subject lines, etc
 of these emails
 yah bhi anivaary hota he ki jisko i-mail preshit kiya ja rahaa he, uske computer main vah font santhaapit ho
 Forgotten sometimes, if you have an opportunity to e-mail or view it in Hindi from another computer or to forward the Hindi e-mail to someone else, then the same font problems arise
 
 iske alaava hindi shabdon ke aadhaar par apane aavashyak i-mail ko dhundne or sahejane main bhi samasyaayen aati hai, chunki vastav main aap angreji ke aksharon ke jariye hindi main kaam kar rahe hote hai
 Problems of this kind are common in both e-mail clients such as Outlook Express and web-based e-mail services such as web-world or Rediff Mail
 is bich bhinn upayoktaaon ke bhinn difolt vinyas ke kaaran yadi bhashaa encoding paribhaasha badal jaati he, to phir likhe gaye paath ko pard paanaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 Popular e-mail services like Yahoo also have this problem
 likhnaa How to write email in Hindi? in samasyaon kaa samaadhaan unicode hindi aadhaarit i-mail ke jariye sambhav he
 But here you have to be two to four with other types of problems
 aapke paas yadi purana oparating system he, to vah unicode ko samarthan nahin karegaa or aap unicode hindi main kaary karne main asamarth honge
 Even if your operating system supports Unicode, then your e-mail client and your browser should also be providing Unicode Hindi support
 kuch halaaton main, jaise ki windos98 main oparating system str par unicode hindi samarthan uplabdh nahin he, parantu is par internet explorer 6 kaa sampurna package santhaapit kar ise unicode hindi ke aanshik upyog laayak banaaya ja saktaa he
 By default, support for Hindi Unicode in Windows 2000 and later and in almost all popular versions of Linux released after 2002 is available to users at the operating system level
 or inamen i-mail claayent tathaa brouzar bhi shaamil hote hai
 Nowadays some Java based tools have also been released that do not require any kind of Unicode support on your computer to run, but a Java-virtual machine is required to be installed
 computer or hindi wiki par likhane ke upaay kaa vivaran he kadi Experiences of e-mail exchanges in Hindi have found that recently, the web-based Gmail service that provides you with SSL3 secure POP3 and SMTP mail service on your e-mail client is the best
 pramukhat: web aadhaarit jimail outluk express 6 par bhi utani hi aasaani se kaam karata he jitna ki linaks ke ke-mail par
 i-mail client ko ji-mail samarthit banane ke liye bas aapako i-mail claayent ke pop / esaimatipi sarwar ko kramash: pop
gmail
com tathaa smtp
gmail
com par set karnaa hoga or esasail suraksha sahit port kramash: 465 tathaa 995 paribhaashit karnaa hoga
 If you find these settings difficult, then there are detailed guidelines for this, there is also an installable file which you can set these configurations automatically by running
 ji-mail kii anya suvidhaayen ye hai jo ise kisi bhi anya i-mail seva se behatar banaate hai: 1
 This web based email service mainly provides you with Pop3 and SMTP facility
 yani aap kisi brouzar se bhi i-mail kar sakate hai tathaa i-mail claayent jaise ki outluk express yaa ke-mail se bhi
 jimail aam upyog ke liye muft he
 However, it has only been released for a limited number of users
 2
 isamen aapako 2 jibi bhandaaran suvidha milti he, saath hi 10 embi fil atechament kii suvidha bhi
 3
 Subject fields of Unicode Hindi e-mail can also be given in Hindi and language encoding like Yahoo is not fragmented in the exchange of e-mail and the e-mail remains intact
 4
 isamen oski aadhaarit hindi jaise ki shusha yaa web-duniya font main bhi kaam kar sakate hai
 5
 G-mail uses SSL for security which you can extend further via GPG
 isamen antarnirmit spom filter bhi he jo aapako avaanchit mail se dur rakhata he
 6
 Google search is available within email, which is obviously quick and appropriate like Google search
 7
 isamen ek bilkul nai vichaardhaara yukt i-mail ko flag karne kii suvidha di gai he jisase i-mail ko mitaayaa na jaakar hameshaa ke liye apane dak-dibbe main rakhe rah kar badhiya upyog main liya ja saktaa he
 8
 It also supports Atom and RSS feeds that automatically collect the latest news and other data of the Internet in your e-mail
 9
 ji-mail ke jariye kisi bhi computer se kahin se bhi hindi unicode main kaam kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, through an online Unicode editor like browser-based sixteenth, Hindi Unicode can be cut and pasted
 10
 abhi ji-mail kaa beta sanskaran jari kiya gaya he, jo nity prati nikhaar par he
 It is possible that we get more good features in its full version
 ji-mail kii ek khami he ki yah javascript par chalata he at: iske liye aapke mashin main java santhaapit hona aavashyak to he hi aapkaa brouzar java script chalaane laayak hona bhi aavashyak he
 For example in Linux systems for web-based email, you can run it from Mozilla and Firefox, but not from the Konqueror browser, which has some limited support for Java
 parantu yah brouzar kii khami he na ki ji-mail kii
 There is no such problem in Windows systems since almost all new browsers support javascript
 javascript par aadhaarit hone ke kaaran upayokta ko ji-mail ke nae sanskarnon ko alag se downlod karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 jab bhi aap ji-mail kaa upyog karte hai, yah naveenatam sanskaran hi rahata he
 And once the script takes a little time to run initially it becomes extremely fast for later use as it then only downloads the text, which consists of just a few bytes
 ji-mail haalaaki aam upyog ke liye muft jari kiya gaya he, parantu isaki sadsyta ko aamajanon ke liye abhi kholaa nahin gaya he
 For this you must be invited by an existing Gmail user
 haalaaki internet par aise kai site hai jahaan se aapako ji-mail ke account muft main mil jaayenge
 Overall, the G-mail service is a handy tool for Hindi e-mail, which is certain that it will still flourish

 Walking or walking or walking is the main type of movement or movement of animals on land and is distinct from running and crawling
 chalanaa daudane se is arth main bhinn he, kyonki chalate samay har kadam par maanav yaa dopyon ke sirf ek pair kaa sampark hi bhoomi se samaapt hota he jabaki daudte samay har kadam par maanav yaa dopyon ke donon pair hi bhoomi se sampark samaapt kar dete hai
 There can be many types of running in horses and other creatures like them, but at every step while walking, they have three legs on the ground
 aaj kii bhaagambhag jindagi ke is daur main pairon se chalanaa lagbhag nahin ke baraabar ho gaya he or vyakti in tamaam phaaydon kii jaankaree rakhte hue bhi paidal chalane se kataraata he yaa yun kah lijie ki ham sab log masini yug ke aa jane ke kaaran aalasy ke agosh main aa gaye hai
 After all, even if it is so, when the facilities of new innovations by scientists have brought us to this level of laziness, due to which walking has started to seem a bit unnecessary
 vastav main yah ek bahut badi kami ko rekhaankit karata he
 Walking has reduced to a great extent in our daily routine, but in present times it has become more important for health than before
 paidal chalanaa bhi ek vyaayaam ke hi baraabar he
 While walking in the morning has a special effect on the entire body, there is a special effect in the body, while the body also relieves joint pain like hands, knees and thighs
 subah ke samay ghoomana har lihaaj se swasthya ke liye uttam hota he
 The surprising thing is that even the old people feel young by walking because on doing this the work of repairing their tissues is done well
 isiliye yadi aap yuva dikhne kii ichha ko man main rakhte hai to adhik se adhik paidal chalem
 Will definitely prove beneficial for health
 tahalne se na keval pachan pranali sahi dhang se kaam karti he apitu kabj se pareshaan vyakti ko bhi avashya hi laabh pahunchaata he
 Moreover, a walk, along with staying good physical health, benefits our mental health more than that
 gauratlab he ki tan man kii thakaan or tanaav ko dur karne hetu sadiyon se yah prachlan istemaal hota aa rahaa he kyonki vyakti ke pairon kii sanrachana daudane kii apeksha zyada chalane ke liye hi ati upyukt he
 Running costs more energy, while the front of the foot, for example, on the heel of the toes, costs 53 percent to 63 percent more than those on the heel
 itnaa hi nahin, pairon ke agle hisse yani panjon ke bal chalate vakt edi par chalane kii apeksha main takhne, ghutane, kuulhe or peeth kii mukhya mansapeshiyon kii kriyasheeltaa kaaphi had tak bad jaati he
 Therefore it is said that instead of running, it is better to walk
 tahaltey samay jo baat dhyaan main rakhni chahie vah yah he ki tahaltey samay shaareerik mudra kaa vishesh samaran rakhana jaruri he anyathaa abhishth laabh nahin miltaa
 While walking, the body should be straight and the mouth should be closed and the breath should be taken completely through the nasal passages
 tabhi laabhadaayak sabit hoga
 Try to breathe through the stomach instead of the lungs
 isse sharir ko adhik oxygen milti he jo dimag tak jaati he or isse sochane or samajhane kii kshamta main khaas badhotaree hoti he
 Although walking can be done at any time, according to experts, morning and evening time is considered suitable for a walk because steroid hormones are released from the body more and more, which makes the person feel pleasant
 so, jab ham tahalne ke liye baahar nikalate hai to sadak va galiyon ke tahalne ke sthaan par ped-paudhon ke madhya park ke bich bich saiyr karne jaisi aadaton ko praathamikta deni chahie
 It is a fact that by walking we see a communication of mental happiness
 paidal chalanaa puri tarah se kayakalp kar saktaa he
 Not only this, it is very beneficial for children studying in the morning to take regular walks in the morning because of the easy development of concentration which does not make much difficulty in remembering
 visheshgyon ke anusaar, praat:kaal tahalne se mastishk main endorphin hormone sravit hota he jis kaaran hamaara mood parivartit hota he or sakaaratmak bhavanaaen utpann hoti he
 Therefore, take a decision to walk on foot from today and get ready to go for long jogging at sunrise and sunset, which is the best workout in the world
 vaise bhi chalanaa hi jindagi he to kyon na khub paidal chalaa jaaen
