 Planck replied that i want to learn old things only
 After Plank's move to this field, there were so many new discoveries in physics that might not have happened in the last thousand years
 plank ne apane anusandhan kii shuruyaat ooshmaagatiki se kii
 He particularly worked on the second law of thermodynamics
 usee samay kuch electric companiyon ne uske saamne ek aise prakaash strot ko banane kii samasya rakhi jo nunatam urja kii khapat main adhik se adhik prakaash paidaa kar sake
 This problem turned Planck's approach to the study of radiation
 He found out the electromagnetic nature of radiation
 is tarah gyaat hua ki prakaash, radio tarangen, parabangnee, infrared sabhi vikiran ke hi rup hai jo darasal vidyut chumbakeey tarangen hai
 Planck, working on black body radiation, gave a rule known as the wein-planck rule
 baad main usne paaya ki bahut se prayogon ke parinaam isse alag aate hai
 He reanalyzed his rule and arrived at a surprising new discovery, called Planck's quantum hypothesis
 in packets ko qvanta kaha jaataa he
 The energy of each quanta is fixed and depends only on the frequency of light
 plank kii is pariklpana ne bhautik jagat main halchal machaa di
 It was here that quantum physics, the new branch of physics, was born
 Later using the same hypothesis, Einstein explained the light-electric effect, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize

 ek kollam-oriented dibmes ek database prabandhan pranali he jo apane vishyon ko panktiyon ke bajaay stambhon main ekatrit karti he
 Datawarehouses and library catalogs benefit from this, where aggregates are computed for a large number of similar data objects
 kisi bhi database se kollam-oriented or ro-oriented sanghathan kaa laabh hasil karnaa sambhav he
 We refer to both by indicating one as column-oriented, one emphasizing the expression of the column-oriented structure and optimization for the column-oriented workload
 This approach is in contrast to Ro-oriented or Row Store databases and Correlation databases, which use a value-based storage structure
 ek database program ko apane data ko do aiami talika main darshana chahie, stambh or panktiyon main, lekin use ek aiami ladi ke rup main sangrahit karnaa chahie
 This simple table contains an employee identifier, name field, and a salary
 yah talika computer kii smriti or bhandaaran main maujuud hoti he
 Although RAM and hard drives are mechanically different, the operating system of a computer separates them
 phir bhi, is database ko apni do aiami talika ko bits kii ek-aiami shrinkhalaa main rakhana chahie, taaki oparating system yaa to ram, yaa hard drive, yaa donon par use rhit kar sake
 a column-oriented database serializes all values together in a row, then moves the value to the next row and so on
 ek kollam-oriented database ek stambh ke sabhi maan ko ek saath kramvaar karata he, phir agle stambh ke maan ko karata he or isi tarah aage badhata jaataa he
 This is a simplification
 vibhaajan, anukraman, kaishing, vichaar, OLAP kyub or vinimay pranali jaise ki rhit ahed loging yaa bahusanskaran sangamiti niyantran, ye sabhi, bhautik sanghathan ko naatakeey rup se prabhavit karti he
 After the fact, online transaction processing-centralized RDBMS systems are more row-oriented, while online analytical processing-centric systems are a balance of row-oriented and column-oriented
 ro-oriented or kollam-oriented pranaaliyon ke bich tulana, aam taur par, ek die gaye kaarybhaar ke liye ek hard-discs abhigam kii kshamta se sambandhit he, kyonki computer main anya deree kii tulana main sik time avishwasaneey rup se lambaa he
 Sometimes, readings of one megabyte of sequentially stored data take no longer than a random access
 
 iske alaava, chunki CPU shakti kii tulana main grahan samay main sudhaar ek dhimi gati se ho rahaa he, yah vishesh dhyaan un systamon par jari rahane kii sambhaavna he jo bhandaaran ke liye hard-discs par nirbhar hote hai
 Below are the simplest conclusions that attempt to create a picture of trade-offs between column-oriented and row-oriented organizations
 beshak tab tak, jab tak anuprayog aashwast naa ho jaae ki adhikansh / sabhi data memory main feet ho saktaa he or us paristhiti main in-memory_databes system se baari anukulan uplabdh he
 In practice, ro-oriented architectures are very adaptable to oltp-like workloads that are highly fraught with mutual transactions
 kollam store oriented bhandar varchlod acchhee tarah jaise ke liye OLAP sadrush varchlod ke liye anukool hote hai, jisamen aam taur par sabhi data par atyadhik jatil prashn shaamil hote hai 
 haalanki, aise kai siddh pankti-aadhaarit OLAP RDBMS hai jo terrabit ko sambhalate hai or yahaan tak ki petabit data ko bhi, jaise terradata
 Column data are of the same type; Therefore there is an opportunity for optimizing storage sizes in column-oriented data that are not available in row-oriented data
 udhaaharan ke liye, kai lokapriy aadhunik sampeedan yojanaayen, jaise LZW yaa ran-length sanketikaran, sampeedan ke liye asann data ke samanta kaa prayog karti hai
 While these same techniques can be used for row-oriented data, a typical implementation may yield less effective results
 
 To improve compression, many implementations sort rows
 udhaaharan ke liye, bitmap index kaa prayog, chhatai se sampeedan ko pariman ke ek kram dwaara sudhaar ja saktaa he 
 lexicographical kram ke sampeedan laabh ko ran-length sanketikaran ke sandarbh main ucchtam seemaa tak badhaane ke liye, pratham chhante hue keez ke rup main nimna-pramukhataa vaale cholemon kaa prayog karnaa sabase acha hota he
 
 For example, in the table given with columns of gender, age, name, it would be best to first sort by gender, then age again by name
 virodh sampeedan kollam-oriented kaa sa vyapaar band karne ke liye yadrichhik abhigam he
 All data back from a row is more efficient when that data is located in the same location, such as in a row oriented architecture
 In addition, greater adjacent compression is achieved and more difficult random access may occur, as data may need to be read to be uncompressed
 Therefore, column-oriented oriented architectures are compressed data sometimes to do so, reducing the need for use by additional rich in mechanisms
 kollam-oriented bhandar yaa transpored filein dibmes vikaas ke shuruaati dinon se lagu kiya gaya he, jo 1970 main shuru hua
 For example, Statistics Canada implemented a RAPID system in 1976 and used it for the processing and retrieval of the Canadian population and habitat, as well as many other statistical applications
 RAPID ko duniya bhar main anya sankhyikeey sanghathanon ke saath saajha kiya gaya or 1980 ke dashak main vyapak rup se istemaal kiya gaya
 It continued to be used by Statistics Canada until the 1990s
 kai saalon tak, keval saibese aikyuu utpaada, kollam-oriented dibmes varg main vyavsaayik rup se uplabdh tha
 However, this has changed rapidly over the years with many open source and commercial implementations
 kollam-oriented dibmes ke vartmaan udhaaharan main shaamil hai: Puri Kendujhargarh Express 8416 is a mail express train operated by Indian Railways
 yah train puri railway stesan se 05:25AM baje chhootati he or kenduzargarh railway stesan par 12:00PM baje pahunchati he
 Its travel duration is 6 hours 35 minutes

 After the independence of India, the Ministry of Education established the board in 1950 for scientific-technical terminology
 san 1952 main board ke tattwavdhan main shabdaawalee nirmaan kaa kaary prarambh hua
 Finally, in 1960, the Central Hindi Directorate and the Scientific and Technical Terminology Commission were established in 1961 AD
 is prakaar vibhinn avasaron par taiyaar shabdaawalee ko 'paribhaashik shabd sangrah' sheershak se prakashit kiya gaya, jiskaa uddeshy ek ore vaigyanik tathaa takneekee shabdaawalee ayog ke samanvay kaary ke liye aadhaar pradaan karnaa tha or duusari ore antarim avadhi main lekhakon ko nai sankalpanaaon ke liye sarvasammat paribhaashik shabd pradaan karnaa tha
 After independence, the framers of the Constitution of India shifted attention to the development of all the major languages of the country
 samvidhan main hindi ko sangh kii rajbhasha ke rup main manyata di gai or kendriya sarkaar ko yah daayitv saunpa gaya ki vah hindi kaa vikaas-prasar karen evam use samrudh kare
 Accordingly, the Union Ministry of Education, Government of India started several schemes for the development and prosperity of Hindi under Article 351 of the Constitution
 in yojanaon main hindi main takneekee shabdaawalee ke nirmaan kaa kaarykram bhi shaamil kiya gaya taaki gyaan-vigyaan kii sabhi shakhaon main hindi ke madhyam se adhyayan evam adhyaapan ho sake
 The Scientific Vocabulary Board was established in 1950 under the chairmanship of the Education Advisor to give a right direction to the vocabulary building program

 It will take a lot to complete and for this work experts and linguists of all disciplines will be required
 atah bharat sarkaar ne 1 aktubar, 1961 ko prakhyat vaigyanik dow di

 kothaari kii adhyakshata main vaigyanik tathaa takneekee shabdaawalee ayog kii sthapana kii taaki shabdaawalee nirmaan kaa kaary sahi evam vyapak pariprekshya main karyanvit kiya ja sake
 The dream and determination to make Hindi and other modern Indian languages the medium of administration, education and examination, after the independence, was laid by the Constitution makers of India in front of the people of India after much deliberation and devotion
 yah sankalp, yah sapana bharat kii saanskrithik tathaa bhashaayi vividhta ko dhyaan main rakhkar liya gaya ek adarsh aitihaasik faisla tha
 This was a resolution, which was taken to give originality in the field of knowledge science to the soil born in India and to preserve Indianness
 yah rashtriya ekta tathaa saamaajik vikaas ke liye aavashyak tha tathaa ek aisa bhavishyagaami faisla tha jisamen ‘sarvebhavantu sukhinah’ kii bhaavana nihit thi
 When a dream is achieved, when a resolution is taken, when an ideal is put in front, then it also requires effective plans and their implementation to give it a shape
 samvidhan kii 351veen dhara main hindi tathaa anya bhartiya bhashaaon ke liye jo vidhaan kiye gaye, unhen kaaryrup dene ke liye sarkaar ne kai yojanaayen banaai jisamen vaigyanik tathaa takneekee shabdaawalee kaa vikaas, maanakeekaran tathaa ekarupata kii mahatvakankshi yojana bhi thi jo baad main chalakar bharat sarkaar kii shiksha niti main bhi sammilit kii gai
 At the time of independence, English was the dominant language in various disciplines of knowledge and for the borrowing of knowledge taken from the earth, a vocabulary had to be developed in Indian languages which was not born in the soil of India
 isi kaaran yah ek sahaj prayaas na hokar kuch aprakritik swaroop grahan karne ke liye baadhya thi
 In this effort and planned effort, technical terms or synonyms were to be legislated
 aise paryaay, jo anveshak yaa vidwaan kii kriti nahin, balki vishay visheshgy tathaa bhashavid dwaara mul takneekee sankalpana kii soochna anudit bhashaa main samprekshit kar sake
 This uneasy process of vocabulary construction led to many inconsistencies at that time
 kai vidwaanon ne us samay vaigyanik tathaa takneekee shabdaawalee ke vikaas kaa kaam prarambh kar diya
 Some scholars wanted to Sanskritise the vocabulary, while some wanted to mold it into a language called urdu-persian and Hindustani
 us samay kuch aise bhi vidwaan the jinhone angreji ke takneekee shabdon ko devanagari main lipyantaran karke sweekaar karne kii peshkash rakhi parantu in sabase vaigyanik tathaa takneekee vishyon ke bahuyami tathaa vishaal shabd bhandar ko apni bhashaa ke vyakaran, uski prakruti tathaa vidhyaarthiyo, praadhyaapakon, shodharthiyon, anuvaadakon, granth lekhakon kii aakankshaon kii purti nahin ho rahi thi or jis dhang se log shabdaawalee kaa nirmaan kar rahe the usase samvidhan kii garima main nihit aashay kii purti bhi nahin ho rahi thi
 The availability of many synonyms of the same technical term created a chaotic situation which attracted the attention of people towards the planning and management of vocabulary formation
 aise main bharat sarkaar ne yah kaary apane haath main lenaa hi uchit samajha or 1 oktober 1961 ko sthai ayog ke room main vaigyanik tathaa takneekee shabdaawalee ayog kii sthapana raashtrapati ke aadesh ke adheen kii gai
 By making Padma Vibhushan Professor Daulat Singh Kothari a dreamer, eminent educationist and intellectual scientist as the first Chairman of the Commission, the Government of India proved that it is committed to serious efforts for the development of scientific and technical terminology
 pro
 kothaari ne vaigyanik tathaa takneekee shabdaawalee ke vikaas ke liye samanvayvaadee drushtikon ko apanaaya tathaa shabdaawalee nirmaan, uski samiksha evam samanvayan ke liye kuch aise mahatvapurn siddhanton kaa nirupan kiya jiske paalan karne se bharat kii samsik samskruti bhashaayi vividhta, rashtriya ekta tathaa asmita ko surakshit rakhte hue gyaan-vigyaan kii vibhinn shakhaon kii aadhunik tathaa aadhuniktam aavashyaktaaon kii purti karte hue vaigyanik tathaa takneekee shabdaawalee ko viksit karne main kisi prakaar kii koi rukaawat nahin aa sahati thi
 In the years since its inception, the Vocabulary Commission has set Hindi synonyms of about 8 lakh technical words in various branches of knowledge, viz
 Published in saath hi saath san 1968 main granth nirmaan kii yojana ke antargat 15 rajyon main ‘granth academy’ tathaa ‘paathya pustak mandalon’ kii sthapana kii he jisase ki hindi ke saath-saath bharat kii anya aadhunik bhashaaon main takneekee shabdaawalee kaa vikaas tathaa paathya-pustak kaa prakaashan kiya ja sake
 About 12 thousand textbooks have been published so far with the coordinated efforts of the Vocabulary Commission and the established text academies and text-book boards in various states
 iske atirikt poorak saamagree ke rup main granth maalaon, chaynikaaon tathaa patr-patrikaon kii ek lambii suchi prastut kii ja sakati he
 All India terminology, departmental glossaries and administrative terminology are unique efforts of the Commission in itself
 shabdaawalee ayog ne caputarikrut rashtriya shabdaawalee bank kii sthapana bhi kii he
 There will no longer be such a subject taught in universities or there is no such genre of purposeful Hindi whose Hindi synonyms expressing English based concepts have not become stable
 ayog kii akhil bhartiya shabdaawalee yojana ke antargat 18 shabdaawaliyaan prakashit kii ja chuki hai jisamen 20,000 aise shabdon ko vishyavaar sankalit kiya gaya he jinhen akhil bhartiya shabdaawalee ke rup main sweekaar kiya ja saktaa he
 To encourage high-level writing in science, the commission publishes 'vigyan Garima Sindhu', a quarterly journal of science
 manviki tathaa samaaj vigyaan vishyon main isi uddeshy se ‘gyaan garima sindhu’ naamak patrika kaa prakaashan bhi janvari 2000 se prarambh kiya gaya he

 According to the President's order of 27 April 1960, the responsibility of the creation of Hindi equivalents of terminology of all subjects has been entrusted only to the Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology
 atah shiksha, prashasan, adhyaapan aadi sabhi kshetron main sabhi par yah baadhyataa he ki keval shabdaawalee ayog dwaara nirmit maanak shabdaawalee kaa hi sarvatra prayog kiya jaae
 In fact, it is also mandatory in terms of desirability and uniformity of use of standard terminology throughout the country
 vishvavidhyalay anudaan ayog ne bhi sabhi vishvavidhyalayon aadi ko yah nirdesh diya he ki hindi tathaa anya bhashaaon kii pathyapustakon main keval shabdaawalee ayog kii shabdaawalee kaa hi prayog kiya jaae
 Similarly, the Department of Official Language, Ministry of Home Affairs has also directed the use of administrative and other terms created by the Commission in the field of administration
 vibhinn vigyaanon, manviki tathaa saamaajik vigyaanon kii moolbhoot shabdaawalee ke nirmaan kaa kaary san 1971 main puraa kar liya gaya
 Thereafter, the work of coordination and consolidation of the above terminology started
 in sabhi shabd sangrahon kii sthiti is prakaar he: The construction of technical terminology of various subjects started in the Hindi Unit of the Ministry of Education from 1950
 mantralay ne vividh vishyon kii anek aarambhik or anantim shabdaawaliyaan chhaapin or unhen nickshulk vishvavidhyalayon aadi ke praadhyaapakon ko vitarit kiya
 After this, the final accepted vocabulary of many subjects was also printed separately
 san 1962 main in sabhi shabdon ko ekatra kar ‘paribhaashik shabd-sangrah’ ke naam se pehali baar chapa gaya
 There were about 9000 words in this dictionary
 shabdavi ayog kii sthapana ke baad is kaary main bahut gati ai
 Since then, the Commission has published glossaries of various subjects in the form of several glossaries
 ab tak kul milakar lagbhag 35 shabd-sangrah / shabdaawaliyaan chhaapi ja chuki jinamein kul milakar lagbhag 8
5 lakh takneekee shabdon ke hindi paryaay die gaye hai
 The Commission has so far made Hindi synonymous with most of the glossaries of almost all the modern branches of knowledge science
 samvidhan main hindi ko sangh kii rajbhasha ke rup main manyata di gai he
 Accordingly, with a view to the standard, uniformity and universal acceptance of the administrative terminology of Hindi, the Commission has compiled about 15000 words related to administration under the name of 'administrative Glossary'
 ab tak is pustak ke aath sanskaran prakashit ho chuke hai
 This terminology is available to all government departments, offices etc

 The terminology terminology, nuclear physics, etc
 have been finalized
 kuch vibhageeya shabdaawalee ko sambandhit vibhaagon ko prakaashanarth bhej di gai hai tathaa kuch vichaaradhin hai
 The lists of technical terms for the creation of Hindi languages from different departments are received from time to time in the Commission and their Hindi books are decided in due course
 shabdaawalee nirmaan ek nirantar jari rahane vaali prakriya he
 Every year, thousands of new words are used in various subjects in the world, out of which only a few thousand words are adopted permanently by scientists
 in shabdon ke hindi paryaay banane kaa kaary bhi ayog ke vibhinn vishay ekak nirantar karte rahete hai
 In this way, revisions, additions and updates in the terminology of all subjects are continuous
 prarambh main ayog ne alag-alag vishyon kii shabdaawaliyaan chhaapi thim
 After the creation of quite a few words, they were printed as subject-group-wide vocabulary
 vigyaan ke shabdon ko ek sankalan main or manviki ke shabdon ko anya sankalan main chapa gaya
 Later, according to the subjects of engineering, medicine, agriculture, veterinary medicine, public administration, defense, commerce, administration, computer science, space science, printing engineering, metallurgy, they were also printed separately
 vastutah anek shabdaawalee kii maang kaaphi samay se hoti rahi hai taaki vah prayokta ko kam mulya main hi praapt ho jaae
 Accordingly, the Commission is now publishing subject-wise glossaries under one of its schemes in an enhanced form
 1994 se ayog ne vigyaan tathaa anya vishyon kii mahatvapurn shakhaon main viksit shabdaawaliyon main prakashit aamtaur par prayog kiye jane vaale shabdon kaa chayan kar ‘moolbhoot shabdaawalee’ ke prakaashan kaa kaary prarambh kiya he
 These terms are distributed free of cost to students / teachers and other user groups so that the use of scientific and technical terminology in Hindi can be promoted and become popular
 in shabdaawaliyon main aise shabdon ke chayan par vishesh dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he jo snaatak tathaa parasnatak str ke vidhyaarthee, shodh chaatr tathaa praadhyaapak saamanytah prayog karte hai
 The Commission has so far published the fundamental glossaries of subjects like Computer Science, Mathematics, Geography, Geology, Physics, Veterinary Science, Mechanical Engineering and Electronics, Economics, Psychology, Architecture, Archeology, History, Defense, Political Science, Zoology, Agriculture The basic terms of science, botany and sutra science are being prepared for publication
 ayog ke sabhi shabd-sangrah multah angreji-hindi main hai, kyonki strot bhashaa angreji rahi he
 The Commission has published hindi-english versions of many of these vocabulary
 inamen vigyaan ke vishyon kaa shabd-sangrah, manviki ke vishyon kaa shabd-sangrah, ayurvigyaan, krishi evam ejiniyari shabd-sangrah evam prashasnic shabdaawalee ke hindi-angraji sanskaran ab tak prakashit kiye ja chuke hai
 a bilingual version of linguistics terminology has also been published
 shesh sabhi shabdaawaliyon ke hindi-angreji sanskaran) bhi prakashit kiye gayi hai
 The Commission has set up a computer-based National Terminology Bank to modernize the process of submission and publication of its glossaries so that the Commission's terminology is immediately available to all users
 is computerikrut shabdaawalee bank se yah laabh hoga ki- In February 2000, the Commission launched the website http: / / www
cstt
nic
in / on the server of the National Information Center
 is website par ayog ke vishay main agrenji tathaa hindi donon bhashaaon main puri jaankaree di gai he tathaa kai mahatvapurn vishyon kii shabdaawaliyon bhi uplabdh karaayi gayi he
 It is the belief of all academics, linguists and scholars that the technical terminology of Indian languages should be such that there is mutual symmetry in all languages to facilitate higher education, research, exchange and communication of science and uniformity at all India level and Equality should be established
 sabhi bhartiya bhashaaon main samanta kaa pehla aadhaar yah he ki hamaari adhikansh bhashaayen sanskritmulak hai
 Words of Sanskrit origin are easily accepted in abundance states
 phir prashasan evam ucch takneekee shiksha main angreji ke shabd or adaalaton aadi ke kaam main urdu ke shabd sabhi bhartiya bhashaaon main samaan rup se milte hai
 Thus, the search of the same technical terminology for all states has also been a responsibility of the Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology
 tadnusaar 1980 se ayog ne akhil bhartiya shabdaawalee yojana shuru kii jiske antargat sabhi rajyon kii bhashaaon se aise shabdon kaa sankalan kiya gaya jinhen akhil bhartiya prayog ke liye sweekaar kiya ja saktaa tha
 The help of scholars, scientists and linguists of different languages were taken in making lists of these words and they were listed subject wise
 in shabd-soochiyon ko sabhi rajyon main bhejkar unke paathya pustak nirmaan mandalon main kaam karne vaale vaigyanikon / bhashavidon se unki bhashaa main un shabdon ke maanak paryaay mangaae gaye
 After all the languages were synonymous with the boards of the various states, the Commission organized All India Seminars at various sites to which all the State's linguists and linguists were invited
 in sangoshtiyon ke parinmaswaroop vibhinn vishyon ke lagbhag 20,000 aise shabd sankalit kar die gaye hai jinhen akhil bhartiya shabdaawalee ke rup main sweekaar kiya ja saktaa he
 These words have been published subject wise by the Commission in the form of All India Vocabulary of various subjects
 ab tak aisi 19 shabdaawaliyaan prakashit kii ja chuki hai
 Following are the details of the topics in which the All India terminology has been identified: ye shabdaawaliyaan vishvavidhyalay ke vibhinn vishyon ke praadhyaapakon, bhashavidon, lekhakon, anuvaadakon, koshkaron, patrakaron evam rajyon ke paathya pustak nirmaan bordon ko nickshulk vitarit kii jaati he
 It is the plan of the Commission that the All India Vocabulary of all subjects be now published in the same collection so that these glossaries can be available to the word-makers in a single book
 san 1982 main swasthya or parivaar kalyaan mantralay ke anurodh par ayog ne ayurvigyaan ke aam prayog ke shabdon or vaakyanshon ke dakshin bhashaayi paryaayon kaa sankalan karke unhen hindi ke saath prakashit karne kii yojana banaai
 About 5-6 thousand words have been compiled under this scheme

 The purpose of the vocabulary produced by the Commission is not to be limited to the collection of words, but also to use it in teaching at the university level
 sabhi paathya granthon main ayog kii shabdaawalee kaa hi prayog ho, sabhi moulik lekhak, anuvadak tathaa sandarbh-sahitya ke nirmaataa, chaatr evam praadhyaapak ayog kii shabdaawalee kaa prayog karen, iske liye ayog ne anek yojanaayen chaalu kii hai
 One of these major plans is to organize technical terminology workshops
 shabdaawalee kaaryshaala yojana ke antargat ayog vibhinn vishvavidhyalayon evam ucchtar takneekee sansthaaon main vibhinn vishyon main aisi kaaryshaalaaon kaa aayojan karata he jinamein ayog ke sankaay ke sadsy athwa vibhinn vishyon ke visheshgy vidwaan, bhashavid evam shabd-nirmaataa ayog dwaara nirmit shabdaawalee kaa parichay dete hue tathaa unki vyakhya karte hue unke sambandh main kaaryshaala main upasthit praadhyaapakon, vaigyanikon, lekhakon, anuvaadakon se vichaar-vimarsh karte hai
 In these workshops, often two-three subjects are put together and they are invited as professors of nearby colleges related to those subjects
 yah dekha gaya he ki ye kaaryshalaays apane uddeshy main bahut hi safal rahi hai kyonki in kaaryshaalaaon main vichaar-vimarsh ke madhyam se ayog dwaara nirmit takneekee shabdaawalee ke prayog kii pariksha ho jaati he, sabhi sahabhaagi praadhyaapakon ko ayog dwaara nirmit shabdaawalee kii maanakta kii jaankaree dene se unhen apane vishyon ke adhyaapan main maanak shabdaawalee kaa prayog karne kii disha praapt ho jaati he or apane vishay ko hindi madhyam se padhaane main unka sankoch samaapt ho jaataa he
 After getting the information about the process of vocabulary-making from the competent scholars, those professors are able to accept the terminology of the Commission
 unhen yah bhi gyaan ho jaataa he ki takneekee shabdon ke liye sarvatra ek samaan hindi paryaayon kaa prayog anivaary he taaki ek hi sankalpana ke liye vibhinn shabdon ke prayog se araajaktaa utpann na ho
 As a result of deliberations in the workshop, many words are also reconsidered in Hindi equivalents
 vibhinn vishyon main takneekee shabdaawalee ke nirmaan ke baad ayog ne paribhaasha-koshon ke nirmaan kii yojana bhi shuru kii
 Vocabulary or vocabulary consists of English technical vocabulary and their Hindi synonyms, but in the definitions dictionary English technical words, its Hindi synonym and then its definition in Hindi is given in three to four lines
 paribhaasha-kosh kisi bhi vishay ke takneekee shabd kii sankalpana ko sahi rup se samajhane main chaatr, adhyaaapak athwa anusandhankarta kii bahut sahaayta karte hai
 In fact, only a word can be justified by definition
 saath hi paribhaashaon se takneekee shabdon ke prayog kii kshamta bhi spasht ho jaati he
 In this way the definitions dictionary is in some way an extension of the process of vocabulary-making because technical words can be understood properly only through their definitions or interpretations
 shabdaawalee ayog ne ab tak lagbhag 56 paribhaasha kosh prakashit kiye hai
 They are related to social science and humanities, basic science, applied science etc
 inamen vigyaan ke naveenatam vishay, udaahranarth- arthmiti, electronic, taral yantriki, maanchitr-vigyaan, shail vigyaan, padap anuvanshiki, krishi-keet vigyaan aadi bhi shaamil hai
 In terms of the usefulness of these definitions, more than one definition dictionary of many topics has also been published
 udaahranarth, vanaspati vigyaan ke paanch paribhaasha-kosh, rasayan vigyaan ke teen paribhaasha-kosh, shiksha ke do paribhaasha-kosh aadi
 The creation of technical vocabulary is the first phase of the creation of text books in Hindi
 madhyam parivartan ke purv yah anivaary he ki prayek vishay main uchit sankhya main vishvavidhyalay str kii paathya pustakon kaa nirmaan kiya jaae
 These books should not only be high level in terms of subject matter, but should also have standard terminology and have uniformity everywhere
 tadnusaar shiksha mantralay ne 1959 se hi hindi main granth-nirmaan yojana kaa sutarapaat kiya
 Under this scheme, programs of translation, original writing and publication of books were started by the Commission itself and through various universities, academic institutions and state governments as well as in collaboration with private publishers
 shabdaawalee ayog ne anuwaad, moulik lekhan evam prakaashan kaa kaarykram aarambh kiya
 The Vocabulary Commission set up 16 expert committees in diverse subjects for the purpose of selecting titles for translation, original writing and in consultation with them published several books under this program

 LASIK or Lasik is a type of refractive surgery to correct myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism
 LASIK is performed by ophthalmologists using a laser

 An industry body recommends that patients wearing hard contact lenses should stop wearing them for a minimum of six weeks plus hard work contacts have been worn for the next six weeks every three years
 Before surgery, patient corneas are examined together with a pachymeter to determine their thickness and to measure their surface contour with a topographer
 Using low power lasers, a topographer creates a topographic map of the cornea
 This process also detects astigmatism and other irregularities in the shape of the cornea
 Using this information, the surgeon calculates the amount and locations of corneal tissue to be removed during operation

 Severe aberrations can cause significant vision loss
 in aberrations starbursts, ghosting, halos, dabl drushti or anya post oparative jatiltaaon ke ek number shaamil hai
 There are always concerns about LASIK because of its tendency to induce higher order aberrations
 The advancement of LASIK technology has helped reduce the risk of clinically significant visual impairment after surgery

 Effectively, the larger the pupil size, the greater the risk of aberrations

 Over time, most attention has shifted from other aberrations and centered on spherical aberration
 LASIK and PRK induce spherical aberration, because of the laser's tendency to undercorrect outward movement from the center of the treatment area
 yah mukhya rup se pramukh sudhaar ke liye ek mudda he
 Theories posit that if lasers were simply programmed to adjust for this trend, no significant spherical aberration would occur
 acchhee tarah se kuch ucch aadesh aberrations wavefront anukulit LASIK ke saath ankhon main bhavishya ho saktaa he Higher order aberrations taken during pre-op exams are measured in micrometers on the wavescan, while the beam size of the smaller lasers approved by the US Food and Drug Administration is about 1000 times larger than 0

 Thus flaws are inherent in the process and the reason why patients experience corona, glare and starburst, even with small naturally dilated pupils in dim light

 In 2004, the British National Health Service National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence considered a systematic review of four randomized controlled trials before issuing guidance for the use of LASIK within the NHS
 Regarding the process efficacy, Neese reports, "current evidence on LASIK for the treatment of refractive errors suggests that it is effective in selected patients with mild or moderate short-sightedness" but that "evidence suggests its effect in severe short-sightedness
" Effectiveness is weak for long-term and sightedness
 "regarding process safety, Neece reports that" there is long-term and current evidence in the process
 The agreement within the Classroom appears there are concerns about the NHS without special arrangements for audit or research is not sufficient to support its use
 " Refractive surgeons, including at least one author of the study cited in a report in the United Kingdom and the United States, pioneered the belief that serious and dated research is weak
 Relying on the information, the NICE revised guidance was issued in March 2006, which states: "current evidence for correction of refractive errors suggests that photorefractive surgery is safe and efficacious for use in appropriately selected patients" 10 oktober 2006 par, webmd report he ki sankhyikeey vishleshan se pataa chalaa he ki sampark lens pahanane ke sankraman kaa jokhim LASIK se sankraman jokhim se adhik he

 The functioning of transformers, electric generators etc
 is based on this principle
 is niyam ke anusaar, The theory of electromagnetic induction was discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831, and Joseph Henry also discovered this principle independently in the same year
 farade ne is niyam ko ganitiya rup main nimnavat prastut kiya - Where utpann vidyutvahak bal kii disha ke liye lange kaa niyam lagu hota he
 In a nutshell, Lange's law says that the direction of the driving force is such that it can resist the cause

 Faraday gave this rule orally and it was about the 'number of magnetic flux lines' that he developed

 In 1845, Neuman wrote this rule in mathematical terms - jahaan φ b { \ displaystyle \ Phi _{B}}, chumbakeey flux he jise nimnlikhit dhang se paribhaashit kiya jaataa he- Here the floor s { \ displaystyle S} is any floor on which the above closed circuit is located

 vito, latin shabd kaa arth he "main nishedh karata hoon ", kisi desh ke adhikari ko ekatarfa rup se kisi kanoon ko roak lene kaa yah ek adhikaar he
 In practice, the veto may be absolute, restrict or limit a resolution, as in the United States legislative process, by canceling the president's veto on a law by two-thirds of both the House and Senate votes
 Can
 ek vito kinhin tarah ke parivartanon ko rokane kaa; na ki unhen apnaane kaa, sambhawatah aseemit adhikaar detaa he
 It is broadly defined as how the effect the veto dedicates to its holder is directly proportional to the holder's conservatism
 dharak jitna adhik yathasthiti ke samarthan main vito kaa prayog karata he, vito utana hi adhik upyogi hota he
 The concept of veto arose from the Roman Consul and Tribune
 kisi varsh vishesh main padaavarudh do kaunsulon main se koi ek anya ke dwaara kiye gayi sainya yaa naagarik nirnyon ko roak saktaa tha; kisi bhi tribune ko adhikaar tha ki vah roman seenet dwaara paarit kanoon ko ekatarfa roak le
 The institution of the veto, known as Intercasio, was founded in the 6th century BC
 Protecting the interests of the Plebs from the encroachment of the aristocracy, which had dominion in the Senate, was adopted by the Roman Republic as a way of enabling tribunes
 ek tribune kaa vito seenet main kisi vidheyak ko paarit karne se roktaa nahin tha, lekin iskaa taatpary kanoon ko lagu karne main rukawat daalane main tha
 The Tribune could also use a veto to prevent the Bill from being introduced into the Assembly
 chunki nirnay lene kii prakriya main aam taur par donon dandadhikari kii sweekruti aavashyak he, isliye dandadhikariyon ke paas bhi vito kii shakti thi
 If either one disagrees, or in both, one can invoke intercessio to stop the other's action

 In the Westminster system and in most constitutional monarchies, the veto right to withhold legislation was rarely exercised, a power reserved to the emperor

 After the Statute of Westminster the Crown and Parliament of the United Kingdom may not have vetoed or repealed the Act of the Parliament of the Australian Commonwealth on the grounds that it is unfavorable to the law and interest of the United Kingdom
 Other countries in the Commonwealth of Nations such as Canada and New Zealand are similarly affected
 haalanki, australian samvidhan ke anusaar maharani kisi vidheyak par vito kar sakati he jise vidhansabha dwaara sweekrut kar liye jane ke ek saal ke bheetar garvanar-general dwaara shahi sweekrut kar liya gaya ho
 
this right has never been exercised

 aisa sowran ke paraamarsh ke bina kiya ja saktaa he
 However, this reserved right is constitutionally controversial and when it comes to such an occasion that there is a need to exercise this right, it is difficult to predict
 agar sansad dwaara koi vidheyak paarit kiya jaataa he jo aapraadhik, avaidh samvidhan or samvidhan kaa ulanghan he to sambhav he governor general ko aisa karne kii jarurat pad jaae 
 baharhaal, koi yah tark kar saktaa he ki sarkaar shaayad hi koi aisa vidheyak pesh karegi, jisaki asweekruti kii puri sambhaavna ho
 Due to the brief constitutional history of the Commonwealth of Australia, the reserve rights of many imperial representatives are untested and the tradition is followed that the head of the province acts on the advice of its chief minister
 jahaan tak chah rajyon ke governron kaa sawaal he, jo australian rashtramandal ke tahat sanghabaddh hai; kuch had tak unke liye ek alag-alag sthiti hoti he
 Until the Australia Act became 1986, each state was constitutionally dependent directly on the British monarchy
 yadhyapi 1986 ke baad se, ve puri tarah se swatantra ikai hai, haalanki abhi bhi rani desh ke pramukh pradhanmantri kii salaah par governor ko niyukti karti hai
 That is why the monarchy or the Parliament of Britain cannot veto or overturn any act of the governor or the legislature of the country

 In general, the Governor exercises whatever powers of sovereignty, including withholding royal assent

 All legislation passed by both houses of Congress is required to be presented to the President
 desh ke pramukh ke rup main raashtrapati kii kshamta main ise nivedit kii jaati he
 If the President approves the legislation, he signs it if he does not approve it, within ten days without signing it, except Sunday, to the Congress of the United States, where it is drafted in the session of Congress
 Had to be returned
 sanvaidhanik rup se raashtrapati ko likhit rup main kanoon par apni aapattiyon jataana aavashyaktaa hota he or sanvaidhanik rup se congress ko un par vichaar karnaa or kanoon par punarvichaar karnaa aavashyak he
 In effect, this action is a veto
 agar congress kaa donon sadan do-tihaai bahumat se vito kii avhelnaa kar detaa he to yah raashtrapati ke hastakshar ke bina hi kanoon ban jaataa he
 Otherwise, the bill fails to become law until it is reintroduced to the President and he does not sign it
 vidheyak raashtrapati ke hastakshar ke bina bhi kanoon ban saktaa he, basharte ise unke saamne pesh kiye jane ke baad das dinon ke bheetar ve isamen hastakshar karne main vifal ho jate hai to
 agar congress kaa satr kii kaarywahi sthagan ho jane ke baad das se bhi kam kaa samay rah jaataa he or agar raashtrapati ko hastakshar ke liye die gaye das dinon se pehle hi congress kii kaarywahi sthagit ho jaati he to vidheyak kanoon banane main vifal ho jaataa he
 This process, when used as a formal device, is called a pocket veto
 1996 main, congress ne paarit kiya or raashtrapati bill clinton ne line-item vito adhinium 1996 par hastakshar kiya
 The Act allows the President to veto the entire bill and veto the special subject of budget expenditure from the appropriation bill instead of sending it back to Congress
 haalanki, yah line-item vito congress ke aise sadsy dwaara turant chunauti di gayi jo isse sahamat nahin the
 In 1998, the Supreme Court declared that the line-item veto was unconstitutional
 court ne paaya raashtrapati ke samaksh anumodan ke liye yaa puraa kaa puraa radd karne ke liye pesh kiye gaye harek vidheyak main samvidhan kii bhashaa hona jaruri he
 An action by which the President may not take and choose parts of which to bill approved or the amount approved by the President of the state acting as a legislator rather than a head and executive - and in particular As an MLA Congress Puri's place in acting - thus violating the powers separation of principle
 2006 main, sanyukt rajya america ke seenet main seenetter vidheyak pehali baar bill first lejislative line item vito act 2006 pesh kiya gaya
 Rather than granting an actual legislative veto, however, the process created by the act confers the right, if the President repeals any budgetary line item of the budget bill, which he previously signed to enact legislation , Then they already have this power in line with Article II of the US Constitution - Congress has received their request within ten days
 Must vote
 kyonki raashtrapati ke anurodh kaa yah vishay pehle hi kaanoon ban chukaa he, congress dwaara kiya jane vaala matdaan saadhaaran vidhaayi kaarywahi he, jo kisi prakaar kaa vito nahin he - chaahe wo line-item ho, vidhaayi yaa anya kisi prakaar kaa ho

 But once the United States Constitution became law, the right to veto was given to a person with the title "president of the United States"

 In addition, most of these states allow governors to exercise the line-item veto

 The President of Italy may request a second discussion on this before announcing a bill passed by Parliament
 chunki sansad saamaanya bahumat se vito kii avhelnaa kar saktaa he, isliye yah bahut kamjor kism kaa vito he
 The same provision also exists in France and Latvia
 jabaki is tarah ke simit vito ek drudhsankalpi sansadeey bahumat kii ichha ko vifal nahin kar saktaa he, ho saktaa he iskaa der se ho or ho saktaa he sansadeey bahumat ko is maamle par punarvichaar karnaa pade

 Which makes their position strong
 portugal ke raashtrapati kisi vidheyak par hastakshar karne se inkaar kar sakate hai yaa ise athwa iske kuch ansh ko portugali sanvaidhanik nyaayalay ko bhej sakate hai
 If the President refuses to sign a bill without declaring it unconstitutional, the Assembly of the Republic can pass it again and then it becomes law without the President's opinion

 Otherwise, Parliament can overturn that veto by a 2 / 3 majority

 If the court decides that the bill is not unconstitutional or is re-passed by Parliament respectively, the President has to sign it
 satrahavin or atharahavin sadi ke poland ke samvidhan main, ek sanstha hua karti thi, jo liberum vito kehalaati thi
 All bills had to be unanimously passed in Sejam and if a legislator disapproved of a case and voted, it would not only veto the bill; Rather that assembly session would have been dissolved
 This concept derives from the principle of "polish democracy", that the aristocracy of any region is as good as the essence of others, no matter how high or low their physical condition is
 majboot polish shahi rajwanshon ke shashan main ise kabhi vyavhaar main nahin lagaaya gaya, balki 17veen sadi ke madhya main iskaa ant ho gaya or iske baad vaikalpik shashan chalane laga
 As expected, this veto power came to be used more and more consistently to paralyze the authority of the legislature and, it added to the nominal weak kings, which eventually led to the partition and disintegration of the Polish country in the coming century

 ek baar hastinapur ke maharaj ganga ke kinare tapasya kar rahe the
 Fascinated by his beauty, Ganga sat on the thigh
 ganga ne kaha, "he rajan! main rishi kii putree ganga hoon or aapse vivaah karne aapke paas ai hoon
 "on this Maharaja Pratip said," Gange! You are sitting on my right thigh
 patni ko to vamangi hona chaiye, dahini jaangh to putr kaa pratik he atah main tumhen apane putravadhu ke rup main sweekaar karata hoon
 "ganga went away after hearing this
 ab maharaj prateep ne putr prapti ke liye ghor tap karnaa armbh kar diya
 As a result of his tenacity, he received a son, whom he named Shantanu
 shantanu ke yuva hone par use ganga ke saath vivaah karne kaa aadesh de maharaj prateep swarg chale gayi
 To follow his father's order, Shantanu went to Ganga and requested him to marry her
 ganga boleen, "rajan! main aapke saath vivaah to kar sakati hoon kintu aapako vachan dena hoga ki aap mere kisi bhi kaary main hastkshep nahin karenge
 "shantanu got married as promised by Ganga and married him
 ganga ke garbh se maharaj shantanu ke aath putr huye jinamein se saat ko ganga ne ganga nadi main le ja kar baha diya or apane diye huye vachan main bandhe hone ke kaaran maharaj shantanu kuch bol na sake
 When Ganga had an eighth son and she also took him to the river for shed, the king did not stop with Shantanu and he said, "ganges! You shed my seven sons in the river but according to your promise i did not say anything 
 ab tum mere is aathven putr ko bhi bahaane ja rahi ho
 i pray you, please do not throw it in the river
 " yah sun kar ganga ne kaha, "rajan! aapane apni pratigya bhang kar di he isaliye ab main aapke paas nahin rah sakati
 "by saying this, Ganga became attuned to her son
 tatpashchaat maharaj shantanu ne chhattis varsh brahmacharya vrath dhaaran kar ke vyateet kar diye
 Then one day he went to the Ganges and said to Ganga, "ganges! Today i want to see the child whom you took with you
 " ganga ek sundar stri ke rup main us balak ke saath prakat ho gayi or boleen, "rajan! yah aapkaa putr he tathaa iskaa naam devvrat he, ise grahan karo
 Along with being mighty, he will also be a scholar
 astr vidya main yah parashuram ke samaan hoga
 "maharaj Shantanu was overjoyed to find his son Devavrata and brought him with him to Hastinapur and declared him crown prince
 ek din maharaj shantanu yamuna ke tat par gum rahe the ki unhen nadi main naav chalaate huye ek sundar kanya drushtigat hui
 Smell was coming out of his body
 maharaj ne us kanya se poocha, "he devi! tum koun ho?" kanya ne bataaya, "maharaj! meraa naam satyavati he or main nishad kanya hoon
 "maharaj, rearing her youth at her appearance, immediately reached her father and proposed his marriage to Satyavati
 is par dheenvar bolaa, "rajan! mujhe apni kanya kaa aapke saath vivaah karne main koi aapatti nahin he parantu aapako meri kanya ke garbh se utpann putr ko hi apane rajya kaa uttaradhikari bananaa hoga
 
 " nishad ke in vachanon ko sun kar maharaj shantanu chupchaap hastinapur laut aaye
 King Shantanu became distraught due to his separation with Satyavati
 unka sharir durbal hone laga
 Seeing this condition of Maharaj, Devavrata got very worried
 jab unhen mantriyon ke dwaara pita kii is prakaar kii dasha hone kaa kaaran gyaat hua to ve tatkaal samast mantriyon ke saath nishad ke ghar ja pahunche or unhone nishad se kaha, "he nishad! aap saharsha apni putree satyavati kaa vivaah mere pita shantanu ke saath kar den
 i promise you that the child born from your daughter's womb will be the heir to the kingdom
 kaalaantar main meri koi santaan aapaki putree ke santaan kaa adhikaar chin na paye is kaaran se main pratigya karata hoon ki main aajanm avivaahit rahoonga
 "hearing this promise, Nishad folded his hands and said," o Devvrat! Your pledge is unprecedented
 " itnaa kah kar nishad ne tatkaal apni putree satyavati ko devvrat tathaa unke mantriyon ke saath hastinapur bhej diya Devavrata brought his mother Satyavati and handed it over to her father Shantanu
 pita ne prasann hokar putr se kaha, "vatsa! tuune pitrubhakti ke vasheebhoot hokar aisi pratigya kii he jaisi ki na aaj tak kisi ne kiya he or na bhavishya main karegaa
 i give you a boon that you will die by your will
 teri is prakaar kii pratigya karne ke kaaran tu bhishma kahalaayegaa or teri pratigya bhishma pratigya ke naam se sadaiv prakhyat rahegi
 " unke jaisaa vir is sansar main or koi nahin he

 dytome par jo silica kii parat hoti he vah amla se aprabhavit hoti he or har prakaar ke pani main aasaani se mil jaati he
 When a living person drowns in water, with inhalation, the water goes into the lungs and along with it the diatoms found in the water also go into that person's lungs
 rakt ke pravaah ke saath yah dytome sharir ke vibhinn ango main pahunch jate hai
 If diatoms are found in different parts of a person's body, we can say that the person was alive before being drowned in water
 jabaki mrityu ke baad agar kisi bhi vyakti ko pani main phenkaa jaataa he tab dytome kii upasthiti keval jaangh or pairon kii haddiyon main sabase adhik hoti he
 With the help of these diatom tests we can find out whether the person died by drowning in water or whether the dead body was immersed in water
 dytome ke pareekshan se mrityu ke samay kaa bhi pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 For example, if the diatom colony species is less than 20 after the diatom test, then it can be said that the death has been at least 7-12 days
 agar dytome kii jatiyaan 50 se zyada hai to us sthiti main vyakti kii mrityu ko lagbhag 1 saptaah ho gaya mana jaataa he

 It was called by this name because silk was traded from China

 videshon main bhartiya samskruti ke prasar main vyapaar ek mahatvapurn madhyam rahaa
 Since ancient times our Indian ships crossed the vast ocean and reached foreign shores
 unhone vahaan bahut se deshon ke saath vyapaarik sambandh banaaye
 The impression of Indian culture and civilization on the literature, arts and crafts of neighboring countries is clearly visible
 yahaan tak ki sudur amareeki taton surinam or carabian dwipon par bhi bhartiya samskruti ke smriti chihn milte hai
 Samudragupta not only had a powerful army but also a powerful army
 ganga-paar prayadweep main tathaa malay ke sangrahalayon main aise kuch shilaalekh mili hai jo guptkaal main bhartiya navikon ke kriya kalapon ko pramanit karte hai
 Hyunsang, who traveled to India during Harshavardhana's period, has also written in detail about the India of that time
 chol shaskaon ne ek majboot jalsena banaai thi or samudr paar ke deshon par akraman bhi kiye the
 The Portuguese mentions that some Indian merchants owned up to fifty ships

 yahi nahin, pracheen yunaan, rome or faras ke saath hamaare desh ke saanskrithik, dharmik or saamaajik vichaaron kaa khub aadan-praadaan hua
 The flourishing of trade with the Rome Empire was described by Pliny, the historian of Rome, who was saddened by Rome's wealth going into India
 bharatiyon ne videshi logon se anek nai chijen sikhin, udaahranarth- greece or rome se swarna sikkon kii dhalaai, china se resham banane kii kala or indonesia se paan ko ugaana siikhaa
 He established trade relations with foreigners
 vibhinn deshon kii kala or samskruti kaa bhartiya samskruti par bhi prabhaav padaa lekin duusare deshon main bhi iskaa pratibimb dekhne ko mila
 Vegetable is the part of a plant that is cooked and eaten on the heat
 bijon or mithe falon ko praayah sabji nahin kaha jaataa he
 The leaves, stems, stalks and roots eaten are often called vegetables
 saanskrithik drushti se 'sabji' kii paribhaasha sthaneey pratha ke anusaar alag-alag hoti he
 For example, many people consider mushrooms to be vegetables, while according to others, it is not a vegetable but another food category
 kuch sabziyaan kachi khai ja sakati hai jabaki anya sabziyon ko pakaana padataa he
 Vegetables are usually cooked with salt or sourness, but there are also some vegetables that are cooked with sugar to make their sweet or halwa
 'sabz' shabd kaa matlab aadhunik farsi main 'haraa', yaa kabhi-kabhi 'kaala' hota he
 In Persian, 'sabzi' is only really called green leaf-vegetables whereas Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, Kashmiri and other languages of the northern Indian subcontinent include vegetables of any color in the category of 'sabzi'
 dhyaan den ki sanskrit or farsi hind-irani bhashaa parivaar kii bahanen hone ke kaaran hazaron sajaateey shabd rakhti hai or 'sabz' bhi inamen se ek he
 In Sanskrit, the form of this word is 'sasya', which originally meant 'dana or Fruit'

 Neruduppal has a village in Kurnulu district under the state of Andhra Pradesh, India
 mail bagarh, garasain tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat gadhwal mandal ke chamoli jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga kuru kshetra kii yubhumi main shrikrishna ne arjuna ko jo upadesh diya tha vah shrimadbhagavadagita ke naam se prasiddh he
 It is part of Bhishma Parva of Mahabharata
 gita main 18 adhyay or 720 shloke hai
 As stated in the Shankara commentary of the Gita - t धर्म Dharmān Bhagavata as specified Ved Vyāsya: Sarvānoghobhāva गीa Gītākhyai: Saptabhi: Shlokashatairu Panibandha
 gyaat hota he ki lagbhag 20veen sadi ke shuru main gita press gorakhpur ke saamne gita kaa vahi paath tha jo aaj hamen uplabdh he
 Around the 20th century, Bhishmaparva had a translation into the language of Java
 usamen anek mulshlok bhi surakshit hai
 According to Shripad Krishna Belvelkar, in this ancient version of Java, only one and a half eighty-one verses of the Gita are of Sanskrit origin
 unase bhi vartmaan paath kaa samarthan hota he
 The Gita is counted in the Prasthanatrayi, which includes the Upanishads and the Brahmasutras
 atev bhartiya parampara ke anusaar gita kaa sthaan vahi he jo upanishad or brahmasutron kaa he
 In the greatness of the Gita, the Upanishads have been called cow and the Gita is its milk
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki upanishdon kii jo aadhyatm vidya thi, usko gita sarvansh main sweekaar karti he
 Many of the Upanishads are in the Gita
 jaise, sansar ke swaroop ke sambandh main ashwatth vidya, anadi ajanma brahm ke vishay main avyayapurush vidya, para prakruti yaa jeev ke vishay main aksharpurush vidya or aparaa prakruti yaa bhautik jagat ke vishay main ksharpurush vidya
 Thus the specific content of both the Brahmanism of the Vedas and the spirituality of the Upanishads is embedded in the Gita
 use hi pushpika ke shabdon main brahmavidya kaha gaya he
 In the Gita, 'theosophy' refers to the retirement of knowledge
 ise sankhyamat kaha jaataa he jiske saath nivrittimargi jeevanapaddati judi hui he
 But the Gita goes beyond the turn of the Upanishads to the era when a new philosophy was being born which considered the propitious religion of the householders as equivalent to the path of isolation and equally fruitful
 isi kaa sanket denevaala gita kii pushpika main ‘yogashastre’ shabd he
 Here 'yogasastra' refers to Karmayog, of course
 gita main yoga kii do paribhaashaayen pai jaati hai
 From the point of view of a retirement path, which has been called 'samatvam Yoga Uchhyate', that is, it is yoga to be equitable in contrasting qualities
 sankhya kii sthiti yahi he
 The second definition of yoga is 'yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam', that is, even while engaged in Karma, do the work in such a way that it is not the cause of bondage and the Karmakar can keep himself in the same dissonance or uninterrupted condition that the Jnanmargis get
 isi yukti kaa naam buddhiyog he or yahi gita ke yoga kaa saar he
 The tune of 'tasya Prajnapratishthita', which is found in the second chapter of the Gita, refers to the potential intelligence of Nirlep Karma
 yah karm ke sanyas dwaara vairaygy praapt karne kii sthiti na thi balki karm karte hue pade pade man ko vairagyavaali sthiti main dhaalane kii yukti thi
 This is the Karma Yoga of the Gita
 jaise mahabharat ke anek sthalon main, vaise hi gita main bhi sankhya ke nivritti maarg or karm ke pravritimarg kii vyakhya or prashansa pai jaati he
 The condemnation of one and the praise of the other is not the opinion of the Gita, both ways can and are beneficial for human beings with two types of interest
 sambhavat: sansar kaa doosraa koi bhi granth karm ke shaastra kaa pratipaadan is sundarataa, is sookshmata or nishpakshta se nahin karata
 From this point of view, Gita is a wonderful human scripture
 isaki drushti ekangi nahin, sarvangpurn he
 The joy of literature while rendering philosophy in the Gita is its additional specialty
 tatvagyan kaa susanskrit kavyastylee ke dwaara varnan gita kaa nijee saurabh he jo kisi bhi sahruday ko mugdh kiye bina nahin rahata
 That is why it was named Bhagavad Gita, the knowledge sung by God
 shrimadbhagavadgita kii prishthbhumi mahabharat kaa yuddh he
 Just as a normal person gets entangled in the problems of his life and after that, he makes up his mind to flee from the life's confluence, similarly Arjun, who is the great hero of Mahabharata, is afraid of the problems facing him and his life and Kshatriya religion
 Disappointed, just like Arjun, all of us sometimes get frustrated either in a state of uncertainty and or because of our problems
 Dismisses off duty
 bharat varsh ke rishiyon ne gahan vichaar ke pashchaat jis gyaan ko aatmsaat kiya use unhone vedon kaa naam diya
 The last portion of these Vedas is known as Upanishad
 maanav jivan kii visheshta maanav ko praapt bauddhik shakti he or upanishdon main nihit gyaan maanav kii bauddhikta kii ucchtam avasthaa to he hi, apitu buddhi kii simaaon ke pare manushya kya anubhav kar saktaa he uski ek jhalak bhi dikhaa detaa he
 The themes mentioned in the 18 chapters of the Gita are also ordered concordantly
 pratham adhyay kaa naam arjunavishadayog he
 He presents a unique theatrical theater of the teachings of the Gita, in which both the listener and the speaker tend to solve the intricate problem of life, not for the sake of peace
 shaury or dhairya, saahas or bal in chaaron gunon kii prabhoot maatra se arjuna kaa vyaktitv bana tha or in chaaron ke upar do gun or the ek kshamaa, duusari pragna
 Arrived in a position derived from Balapradhan Kshatradharma, Arjuna's mind suddenly attacked another type of emotion, Karpanya
 ek vicitra prakaar kii karunaa uske man main bhar gai or uskaa kshaatr swabhaav lupt ho gaya
 He was alienated from the duty for which he was committed
 upar se dekhne par to is sthiti ke paksh main uske tark dharmayukt jaan padate hai, kintu usne swayan hi use carpanya dosha kaha he or yah mana he ki man kii is kaatarata ke kaaran uskaa janmasiddh swabhaav upahat yaa nasht ho gaya tha
 He was not able to decide whether to fight or take restlessness
 kya kare, kya na kare, kuch samaj main nahin aata tha
 Upon reaching the peak of this mood, he put Dhanushbana aside
 krishna ne arjuna kii vah sthiti dekhakar jaan liya ki arjuna kaa sharir thik he kintu yuddh aarambh hone se pehle hi us adbhut kshatriya kaa manobal tut chukaa he
 This body cannot stand without the mind
 atev krishna ke saamne ek guru kartavya aa gaya
 Hence Arjuna's salvation from logic, from intellect, from knowledge, from the discussion of karma, from the nature of the world, from the state of life in him, from the introduction of the regulator Akshay Purush, and from the vision of that supremely supreme authority
 This was his goal
 isi tatvacharchaa kaa vishay gita he
 In the first chapter, Arjuna, as a role in the usual manner, told God his position
 duusare adhyay kaa naam sankhyayog he
 In it, two ancient traditions of life have been described by arguments
 arjuna ko us kripan sthiti main rote dekhakar krishna ne uskaa dhyaan dilaayaa he ki is prakaar kaa clayvy or hriday kii kshudra durbalata arjuna jaise vir ke liye uchit nahin
 Krishna called all the tips given by Arjuna till now a false form of enlightenment
 unki yukti yah he ki pragyadarshan kaal, karm or swabhaav se honevaale sansar kii sab ghatnaon or sthitiyon ko anivaary rup se sweekaar karata he
 Live and die, be born and grow, subjects come and go
 sukh or dukh kaa anubhav, ye to sansar main hote hi hai, isi ko pracheen acharya paryaaywad kaa naam bhi dete the
 The cycle of time brings and takes all these conditions
 jivan ke is swabhaav ko jaan lene par phir shok nahin hota
 This is the satire of God that why even Arjuna has fallen into this kind of fascination, considering Pragya's point of view
 upar ke drushtikon kaa ek aavashyak ang jivan kii nityata or sharir kii anityata tha
 Mourning for the eternal creature is as futile as the worry of saving the eternal body
 ye donon aprihaary hai
 It is not appropriate to grieve as birth and death occur in turn
 phir ek doosraa drushtikon swadharm kaa he
 Since birth, nature has set a religion for everyone
 usamen jivan kaa maarg, ichchhaaon kii paridhi, karm kii shakti sabhi kuch aa jaataa he
 It cannot be escaped
 koi bhaage bhi to prakrutti use phir khinch laati he
 In this way, the change or magnitude of Kaal, the continuity of the living being and the self-righteousness or nature of the tips by which God has explained to Arjuna, he has called the wisdom of Sankhya
 isse aage arjuna ke prashn na karne par bhi unhone yogamarg kii buddhi kaa bhi varnan kiya
 This intellect is the intelligence of the urge of karma or tendency path, while doing karma, it is necessary to protect oneself from attachment to the fruits of karma
 karmyogi ke liye sabase bada dar yahi he ki vah fal kii ichha ke dal dal main fas jaataa he; usase use bachanaa chahie
 Arjuna wondered if it is possible to get this kind of intelligence
 vyakti karm kare or fal na chaahe to uski kya sthiti hogi, yah ek vyaavhaarik shankaa thi
 He asked how does such a strong-minded person behave in life? Coming, going, eating, drinking, doing deeds, how can we be abused even after indulging in them? Krishna has explained the restraint of the mind in comparison to how many external senses
 kaam, krodh, bhay, raag, dwesh ke dwaara man kaa saumybhav bighad jaataa he or indriyaan vash main nahin rahati
 Indrajaya is the biggest self-respect
 baahar se koi vishyon ko chhod bhi de to bhi bheetar kaa man nahin maanata
 When the taste of subjects goes through the mind, then the mind becomes cheerful, calm and happy
 samudr main nadiyaan aakar milti hai par vah apni maryaada nahin chodta
 While living in such a world, accepting its practices, many desires keep entering the mind
 kintu unase jiskaa man apni maryaada nahin khota use hi shanti milti hai
 It is called Brahmi Situation in the Gita in the definition of ancient spirituality
 is prakaar sankhya kii vyakhya kaa uttar sunakar karmyog naamak tisare adhyay main arjuna ne is vishay main or gaharaa utarane ke liye spasht prashn kiya ki sankhya or yoga in donon margon main aap kise acha samajhate hai or kyon nahin yah nishchit kehete ki main in donon main se kise apanaaun? isapar krishna ne bhi utani hi spashtataa se uttar diya ki lok main do nishthaayen yaa jeevandrushtiyaan hai-sankhyavaadiyon ke liye gyanayog he or karmmargiyon ke liye karmyog he
 Here no person can give up karma
 prakruti teenon gunon ke prabhaav se vyakti ko karm karne ke liye baadhya karti he
 There is a great doubt about the survivors of karma, that is that they leave karma from the top, but the mind is immersed in it
 yah sthiti asay he or ise krishna ne gita main mithyaachaar kaha he
 The simple human way is to do karma by stopping the karmadrians in the mind
 krishna ne chunauti ke rup main yahan tak kah diya ki karm ke bina to khaane ke liye ann bhi nahin mil saktaa
 Then Krishna introduced the law of karma as a cycle
 na keval saamaajik dharaatal par bhinn vyaktiyon ke karmchakr aron kii tarah aapas main piroe hue hai balki prithvi ke manushya or swarg ke devtaa donon kaa sambandh bhi karmchakr par ashrith he
 It is obvious that here humans do work, do agriculture, and divine powers send rain water
 ann or parjanya donon karm se utpann hote hai
 Human actions in one, divine actions in the other
 phir karm ke paksh main loksangrah kii yukti di gai he, arthath karm ke bina samaaj kaa dhaanchaa khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Those who are leaders of the world, knowledgeable like Janak also have a tendency in karma
 krishna ne swayan apana hi drushtaant dekar kaha ki main narayan kaa rup hoon, mere liye kuch karm shesh nahin he
 Still i do deeds without sleep and others walk my path
 antar itnaa hi he ki jo murkh hai ve lipt hokar karm karte hai par gyani asang bhav se karm karata he
 In the Gita, here is a well-known word, intelligence
 arthath jo saadhaaran samaj ke log karm main lage hai unhen us maarg se ukhaadnaa uchit nahin, kyonki ve gyanavaadee ban nahin sakate, or yadi unka karm bhi chhot gaya to ve donon ore se bhatak jaayange
 In the fourth chapter, whose name is Jnana-karma-sanyas-yoga, it has been told that by which knowledge the fruits of karmasanyas can be obtained while doing karma
 isamen sachche karmyog ko chakravarti raajaaon kii parampara main ghatit mana he
 Illustrations of several Chakravarti kings such as Mandhata, Sudarshan are given
 yaheen gita kaa vah prasiddh aashwaasan he ki jab jab dharm kii glani hoti he tab tab manushyon ke bich bhagwaan kaa avatar hota he, arthath bhagwaan kii shakti vishesh rup se moort hoti he
 It is here that a sentence deserves special attention - Kshipraman manushe lokay siddhirbhavati karmaja
 ‘karm se siddhi’-isse bada prabhaavshaalee sutara gitadarshan main nahin he
 But Geetatattva improves and corrects this sutra so much that it should be done in a senseless way, that is, from fellowship
 paanchave adhyay main phir ve hi yuktiyaan or drudh rup main kahin gai hai
 In this, special attention has been paid to the rites or purification of the mind which is associated with karma
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki unche dharaatal par pahunchakar sankhya or yoga main koi bhed nahin rah jaataa he
 If you walk properly on any one path, then you get the same result
 jivan ke jitne karm hai, sabko samarpan kar dene se vyakti ekadam shanti ke dhruv bindu par pahunch jaataa he or jal main khile camel ke samaan karm rupi jal se lipt nahin hota
 The sixth chapter is Atamsayam Yoga, whose subject is revealed by name
 jitne vishay hai un sabase indriyon kaa sanyam-yahi karm or gyaan kaa nichod he
 The same state of mind in happiness and in sorrow is called Yoga
 saatven adhyay kii sangya gyanvigyaan yoga he
 These are two definitions of ancient Indian philosophy
 unamem bhi vigyaan shabd vaidic drushti se bahut hi mahatvapurn tha
 The knowledge of the infinitude of the universe is science and progress from monotony to unity is knowledge
 ye donon drushtiyaan maanav ke liye uchit hai
 In this context, the definite explanation of these two forms of placenta and para nature from the point of view of science is definitely worthy of attention
 aparaa prakruti main aath tatv hai, panchabhoot, man, buddhi or ahankaar
