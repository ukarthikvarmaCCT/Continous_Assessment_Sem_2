 The number of neutrons in an atom of an element can be expanded
 protone or neutron kii sankhya us parmaanu kaa dravyaman sankhya hota he or prayek samasthanik main dravyaman sankhya alag alag hota he
 For example, the three isotopes of carbon are carbon-12, carbon-13 and carbon-14
 inamen sabhi kaa dravyaman sankhya kramshah 12, 13 or 14 he
 Carbon has 6 atoms, which means that all atoms of carbon have 6 protons and the number of neutrons is 6, 7 and eight respectively

 All of Western Europe was religious in the early 16th century - all were Christians; All were members of the Roman Catholic Church; He believed in his traditional education and accepted his rule in religious matters, namely the rule of the Pope of Rome
 europea dharmasudhar athwa riformation 16veen shatabdi ke us mahaan andolan ko kehete hai jiske falswaroop paashchaatya isaayiyon kii yah ekta chhin-bhinn hui or protestant dharm kaa udai hua
 Reformist movements continued from time to time in the history of the church, but they did not challenge the religious principles of the church or its rulers, according to their instructions, to eliminate moral evils and promote religious education as their objective
 16veen shatabdi main jo sudhaar kaa andolan pravartit hua vah sheeghra hi carch kii paramparaagat shiksha or uske shaskaon ke adhikaar, donon kaa virodh karne laga
 As a result of the Reformation movement, Catholicism as well as Luther sect, Calvin sect, Anglican sect and Presbyterian sect became prevalent in Europe
 dharmasudhar kaa yah naveen swaroop samajhane ke liye europe kii tatkaaleen paristhiti par vichaar karnaa atyant aavashyak he
 The sense of reverence that Christians have had for centuries for the Catholic Church promoted by Christ had been reduced for several reasons
 14veen shatabdi main ek francisi pope kaa chunaav hua tha, jo jivan bhar france main hi rahe
 As a result, for 40 years later two pope existed, one in France and one in Rome, dividing the entire Catholic world into two parts
 aathvin shatabdi main frank jati ke katholic raja ne italy par akraman karne vaali lonward sena ko haraakar italy kaa madhya bhaag pope ke adhikaar main de diya or is prakaar roman katholic carch ke parmadhikari dharmaguru ke atirikt ek saadhaaran shaasha bhi ban gaye
 For this reason, the kings of Germany and France instinctively tried to interfere in the affairs of the Church and especially in the election of the Pope
 14veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main yah chunaav italy ke abhijaat varg kii pratiyogita kaa maidan ban gaya tha jisase vyakti kii yogyata par kam, uske vansh par adhik dhyaan diya jane laga
 As a result, at that time, extremely inept pope was elected and morality and religion began to be neglected in the court of Rome
 at: rome ke carch ke prati shraddha kaa ghat janaa nitant swaabhaavik tha
 Another reason for dissatisfaction was that the institutions of the entire church were taxed according to their property and the representatives of Rome always wandered and collected this money
 carch ke kendriya sanghathan kii is durdasha ke atirikt vibhinn dharmapraanton kii paristhiti bhi santoshjanak nahin thi

 In universities, piety had begun to give greater importance to their differences in the subject of secondary questions, which led to the devotion of Catholic theology so much that some believers became convinced that theology was an impediment to spiritual practice
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki carch ke sabhi kshetron main sudhaar kii apeksha thi or dharmasudhar kaa andolan anivaary ho gaya tha
 In the 14th century, Angrez Wickliffe and later Bohimiya's Huss Jo started teaching that the organization of the church, its rites, etc

 Although Henry tried to stop propagating Protestant doctrines throughout his kingdom, he separated the Church of England from Rome in 1531 AD for personal reasons, thus the Anglican community was started
 henry ke uttaradhikariyon ke samay main us carch par protestant vichaardhaara kaa gaharaa prabhaav padaa jisase aajkal vah protestant dharm kii teen pramukh shakhaon main se ek mana jaataa he kintu vastav main anglican samudaay kii utpatti, vikaas or prachaar kaa apana alag itihaas he

 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki dharm sudhaar kaa sambhavat: sabase gaharaa evam hitkari prabhaav puraane kathilak carch par hi padaa
 Seeing the wide spread and deep impact of the reform of European religion, a question arises in our mind that what is the secret of this unprecedented success
 is safalataa ke anek kaarnon kii kalpana kii gai he : The pathetic condition of the Catholic Church in the early 15th century and the inaction of its masters, the aid of politicians eager to seize the property of the Church, the movement of personal freedom due to the Renaissance, new features of propaganda from the invention of printing

 spashtatah in sabhi vichaaron main saamaajik nyaay ke prati gaharaa sarokaar tha
 Nevertheless, Marx criticized all these ideas and insisted that a concept like justice is needed within capitalism because in such a system some people who occupy the means of production exploit the majority proletariat
 unhone kranti ke madhyam se ek aisi vyavastha kaayam karne kaa lakshya rakhaa jahaan har koi apni kshamta ke anusaar kaam karne or apni aavashyaktaa ke anusaar chizein hasil karne kii paristhitiyaan praapt hon
 But the practical form of Marxism and Liberalism that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century was distorted, not like his assurances
 marxvad se prerit roosi kranti ke kuch varshon baad hi stalinavaad kii sarvasattavadi sanrachanaayen ubharne lageen
 At the same time, liberalism and capitalism pushed the world into two world wars, the Great Depression, fascism and Nazism due to internal complications
 poonjeewaad ko sankat se ubaarane ke liye poonjeewaadi deshon main clasical udaarataavaadi sutara se lekar kinsvaadi nitiyon tak har sambhav upaay apnaane kii koshish kii gayi
 In this whole context, the talk of social justice went on the back foot or was only used as a show
 isi daur main upniveshwaad ke kilaaf chalane vaale sangharshon main maanav-mukti or samaaj ke kamazor tabakon ke hakon aadi kii baaten zordaar tareeke se uthaayi gayin
 Especially in the Indian independence movement, there was a serious debate on the issue of social justice for all sections
 is bahes se hi samaaj ke vanchit tabakon ke liye sansad evam naukariyon main aarakshan, alpsankhyakon ko apni aasthaa ke anusaar adhikaar dene or apni bhashaa kaa sangrakshan karne jaise praavdhaanon par sahmati bani
 Later these consents became part of the Indian Constitution
 isi ke saath-saath maanakeey udaarataavaadi siddhant main rajya dwaara samaaj ke kuch tabakon kii bhalaai yaa kalyaan ke liye zyaada aay vaale logon par tex lagane kaa masalaa vivaadaaspad bana rahaa
 Keynes suggested provisions for employment through state intervention to bring capitalism out of recession, but scholars such as Fredrik Van Hayek, Milton Friedman, and later Robert Nozick criticized the state's interference in economic activity
 in logon kaa maananaa tha ki isse vyakti kii swatantraaa or aarthik azaadi ko chot pahunchati he
 John Rawls in his book a Theory of Justice in 1971 gave powerful arguments for why the state should actively intervene for the betterment of the weaker sections of society
 apni thiyari main rolls shuddh prakriyaatmak nyaay kii avadharana prastut karte hue vitaranamulak nyaay ke lakshya ko hasil karne kii koshish karte hue dikhaai dete hai
 In his principle of justice he advocated the right to equal liberty to everyone
 iske saath hi bhedamulak siddhant ke madhyam se yah spasht kiya ki saamaajik or aarthik antaron ko is tarah samyojit kiya janaa chahie ki isse sabase vanchit tabake ko sabase zyaada faaydaa ho
 In later years, many criticisms of Rawls's theory also appeared, which actually represented many new dimensions in the context of social justice
 is sandarbh main samudayavaadiyon or nariwadiyon kii dwaara kii gayi aalochanaon kaa vishesh rup se ullekh kiya ja saktaa he
 Communists criticized liberalism in general and Rawls's theory in particular because it introduced the atomistic concept of the individual
 rolls jis vyakti kii sankalpana karte hai vah apane sandarbh or samudaay se puri tarah kataa hua he
 Later, in the late 1980s, liberals tried to accommodate the criticisms of the communists within liberalism which resulted in the concept of multiculturalism
 isamen yah mana gaya ki alpsankhyak samoohon ke saath vaastavik rup se tabhi nyaay ho saktaa he, jab unhen apni samskruti se jude vividh pahaluon kii hifaazat karne or unhen saarvajanik rup se abhivyakt karne kii azaadi mili
 For this it is necessary that their community rights be recognized
 is tarah saidhantik vimarsh ke str par bahusamskritwad ne saamaajik nyaay kii avadharana main ek nayaa aayam joda
 It is worth mentioning here that from the sixties, the feminist movement, civil rights movement, gay, lesbian and trans-gender movement and environmental movement started to emerge in the West
 baad ke dashakon main inkaa prasar zyaada badha or inhone saidhantik vimarsh ko bhi gaharaai pradaan kii
 For example, feminists criticized liberalism and the Rawlsist framework
 apane vishleshan dwaara unhone pitrusatta ko nariwadiyon ke samaan haq ke raste main sabase badi rukaawat ke rup main rekhaankit kiya
 Similarly, gay, lesbian and trans-gender people questioned the dominant framework of 'normal' or 'normal' in society and demanded equal status for themselves
 naagarik adhikaar andolanon dwaara pashchim main, khaas taur par america samaaj main kaale logon ne apane liye barabari kii maang kii
 Native residents have also made a lot of agitations demanding their cultural rights
 bahusamskritivaadiyon ne apni saidhantik ruparekha main in sabhi pahaluon ko sametane kii koshish kii he
 All these aspects have added many new dimensions to the meaning of social justice
 isse spasht hota he ki vividh samoohon ke liye saamaajik nyaay kaa alag-alag arth rahaa he
 In fact, social justice is more radical in developing societies than in Western societies
 masalan, dakshin africa main ashwet logon ne rangabhed ke kilaaf or satta main apni hissedari ke liye zordaar sangharsh kiya
 The nature of this struggle was different from the struggle waged by black people in America in the sense that black people in South Africa were facing a more oppressive situation
 is sandarbh main bharat kaa udhaaharan bhi ullekhneey he
 Many of the community rights that multiculturalism emphasized are already registered in the Indian constitution
 lekin yahan saamaajik nyaay vaastavik raajnneeti main sangharsh kaa naaraa ban kar ubhara
 For example, Bhimrao Ambedkar and many leaders of the oppressed castes and communities, having trained and organized the marginalized castes at the margins of society, had created a legacy to regain their just rights
 isi tarah pachaas or saath ke dashak main raamamanohar lohia ne is baat par jor diya ki pichhadon, daliton, alpsankhyakon or striyon ko ekajute hokar saamaajik nyaay ke liye sangharsh karnaa chahie
 Lohia wanted these groups to unite and challenge the domination of upper castes in power and jobs
 is prishthbhumi ke saath nabbe ke dashak ke baad saamaajik nyaay bhartiya raajnneeti kaa ek pramukh naaraa banataa chalaa gaya
 Due to this, the groups so far away from power got the opportunity to come to the center of power politics
 gauratlab he ki bharat main bhi paryaavaran ke andolan chal rahe hai
 But these battles are linked to the struggles of local communities in their 'water, forest and land'
 isi tarah vikasshil samaajon main alpsankhyak samooh bhi apane kilaaf purvagrahon se ladate hue apane liye zyaada behatar suvidhaon kii maang kar rahe hai
 In this sense, the struggle for social justice is a struggle with the existence and identity of the people
 is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki saamaajik nyaay ke naare ne vibhinn samaajon main vibhinn tabakon ko apane liye garimamay zindagi kii maang karne or uske liye sangharsh karne ke liye prerit kiya he
 Even in theoretical discourse, from Utopian socialism to the present times, social justice has added many dimensions
 yah bhi ullekhneey he ki viksit samaajon kii tulana main vikasshil samaajon main saamaajik nyaay kaa sangharsh bahut jatiltaaon se ghira rahaa he
 On most occasions, people in these societies have faced much structural violence in the struggle for social justice and on many occasions state violence
 lekin saamaajik nyaay ke liye chalane vaale sangharshon ke kaaran in samaajon main buniyadi badlaav hue hai
 Overall, over time, the theory of social justice has added many new dimensions and as a concept or slogan, it has awakened the groups living in silence or backstory for a long time

 apane jeevankaal main unhen khyaati nahin mili, kintu ab unhen romentic yug kii kavita or chakshush kalaon ke kshetra kii ek mahaan aarambhik hasti ke rup main mana jaataa he
 It has been said of his prophetic poetry that he is "an English-language poet who has been read less than in proportion to his merits"
 a contemporary art critic had to declare that "britain has never produced such a great artist far and wide" about his visual artistry
 Although he lived in London, his entire life, except for a period of three years, was spent in Felfham, creating a diverse and symbolically rich literature that embraced the "body of God", or the concept of "human existence itself"

 However, a biography written by Peter Ackroyd states that Blake later had to include Baysire's name in the list of art opponents — and then cut it off
 In addition, Baysair's style of carving was considered old fashion at the time and Blake's instructions in this fashionless form would have proved detrimental to his work or recognition in later life

 Blake's first biographer, Alexander Gilchrist, has reported that in 1780, Blake was on the Great Queen Street side of the Baysair store, when he was struck by a raging mob that broke London's Newgate Prison
 They attacked the prison doors with shovels and axes, set fire to the building and rescued the prisoners inside

 The attacks took place in protest against a bill of parliament banning Roman Catholicism, later known as Gordon Royts
 unhone jorge III kii sarkaar ke kanoonon tathaa pratham police bal ke gathan ke khilaaf vidroh ko hawa di
 Despite Gilchrist's insistence that Blake was forced into the crowd, some biographers have argued that he impulsively followed the crowd, or supported it as a revolutionary act

 In the year 1782, Blake met John Flaxman, who became his mentor, and Catherine Baucher, who became his wife
 At that time, Blake was recovering from the relationship, which could not result in marriage
 He told the story of his heartbreak to Catherine and his parents, after which he asked Catherine, "will you make me sad?" When he answered in a definitive manner, Blake announced, "I love you
" Blake married Catherine on August 18, 1782, at St
 Mary's Church in Battersea, who was 5 years younger than him
 shikshit catherine ne apane vivaah samjhaute par ‘eks’ ke saath hastakshar kiya

 After his father's death, William and his brother Robert opened a print shop in 1784 and began working with revolutionary publisher Joseph Johnson

 Blake, along with William Wordsworth and William Godwin, had high expectations from the French and American revolutions and wore a Fregean cap to demonstrate their solidarity with the French revolutionaries, but was disappointed by the origins of the reign of terror in Robespierre and France 
 In 1784, Blake wrote his incomplete manuscript An a Island in the Moon
 blake ne mairi woolstencraft rachit original stories from rial life ko chitrit kiya
 Their views on gender equality and the institution of marriage seem to be shared, but there is no evidence that the two actually met

 In 1788, at the age of 31, Blake began experimenting with relief etching, a method he used to use most of his books, paintings, perches, and, of course, his poems including his long 'frophesies' and his best works The "bible" was included
 is prakriya ko iluminated printing ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he or isse nirmit rachanaaon ko iluminated kitaab athwa prints kaha gaya
 Illuminated printing involves writing the words of the poems with a pen or brush on copper strips, in which an anti-acid medium was used
 chithran pehle kii chitrit pandulipiyon kii tarah shabdon ke saath-saath dikhaai padate the
 Then they used to cast copper strips in acid so that untreated copper dissolves and the design is printed in relief
 yah eaching kii saamaanya vidhi ke vipareet hoti he, jahaan digaayan kii panktiyon ko amla ke sampark main rakhaa jaataa he or pattica ko integleo vidhi dwaara print kiya jaataa tha
 The purpose of Relief Etching was to produce his illustrated books at a more rapid pace than the intaglio

 The pages printed from these strips were then hand-dyed by watercolor and stitched together to form the volume
 blake ne iluminated printing kaa prayog apni adhikansh suprasiddh rachanaaon ke liye kiya he, jinamein shaamil he songaz of inocense and experience, da book of thel, da marriage of hewan and hell, tathaa jerusalem 
 Although Blake became famous for his relief etching, his commercial works prominently use intaglio carving, a standard 18th-century process of carving, in which artists engraved the painting on a copper plate
 yah ek jatil or shramsadhy prakriya thi, jisamen platon ko purna hone main maheenon athwa varshon kaa samay lagata tha, lekin jaisaa ki bkel ke samakaleen jon boedell ne zikr kiya he, aisa utkeernan "vyavsaayikta se judaa" tha, jisase kalakaar darshak samooh se judate the or is prakaar yah 18veen sadi ke ant tak ek mahatvapurn gatividhi ban gai thi
 Blake adopted the intaglio engraving method for illustration of his works, particularly The Book of Jobs, which was completed just before his death
 Most of the important work focused on Blake's relief etching as a technique, as it was the latest form of his art, but a 2009 study draws our attention to Blake's currently available palettes, including those that Were created for The Book of Jobs: they explain that they repeatedly used the technique known as "reposages", Programming was the method of obliterating mistakes by hammering from the back of the plate

 Blake's marriage to Catherine remained deep and devoted until his death

" The soldiers are completely slaves

 Blake got the opportunity to work for Dante's Divine Comedy in 1826 through Linnell, whose main purpose was to create a series of engravings
 After Blake died in 1827, the work was halted and only a few watercolors could be completed, out of which only seven carvings could be produced in proof
 Nevertheless, he received praise: blake dwaara kavy kaa chithran keval ek sanlagn kriti nahin thi balki paath ke samikshatmak punarawalokan athwa kuch aadhyatmik athwa naitik pahaluon par tippanee bhi tha
 Blake's motive may have been unclear as the project was never completed

 Due to personal mythology and complex symbolism found in Blake's later poetry, his later works were less published than the earlier works
 The recently edited Vintage Anthology of Blake by Patty Smith focuses primarily on early work, as has been done by several critical studies, such as William Blake, DG Gillheim
 blake ke aarambhik krititv vidrohi prakruti kii hai or unhen roodhiwaadee dharm ke khilaaf pratirodh ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 This is particularly reflected in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, in which Satan is the protagonist rebelling against the hypocritical authoritarian deity

 Not all of Blake's readers agree on how much continuity between his earlier and later works
 manovishleshak jun singer ne likhaa he ki blake kii baad kii kritiyon main un vichaaron ke vikaas ko darshaya gaya he, jo unki aarambhik kritiyon main pehali baar paae gaye, jaise ki, sharir or aatma kii vyaktigat sampoornataa ko praapt karne ke maanavtaavaadi lakshya

 With reference to Blake's last poem "jerusalem" she writes: da marriage of hewan and hell main pratigyaat manushya kaa daivipan antat: purna hua
 Although John Middleton writes of a disconnection between Mary Marriage and later works that initially focus on Blake's apparent negative antagonism between energy and reason, Blake later gives up as a path to inner monotony and The emphasis is on forgiveness
 da mariz of haven and hell ke tivratar dwaitvaad kaa yah parityag khaastaur se baad kii kritiyon main eurigen ke charitra ke maanvikaran dwaara spasht he
 Middleton describes Blake's later works as "mutual understanding" and "forgiveness for one another"

 Blake's scholarship was more focused on the theme of the 20th century than it is today, although it is still referred to today, mainly by Blake's scholar Magnus Ancarzo, who has challenged this interpretation

 During the tremendous stress of their marriage, which was the reason that Catherine was unable to produce children directly, he advocated to bring a second wife straight into the house
 According to his poetry, love becomes more of a responsibility rather than a genuine attachment due to the demand for marital loyalty

 Law and love are two opposing things for Blake and he rebukes the "propose marriage-bed"
 vijance main blake likhte hai: Till she who burns with youth, and knows no fixed lot, is boundin spaces of la to one she loths? And Must She Drag the Chanoff Life in Very Lust? 19veen shatabdi ke prasiddh kavi or mukt prem ke himachati algarnan charles swinberne ne ek puri kitaab uparokt abhipraay par dhyaan aakarshith karte hue blake par likhaa he, jisamen blake “pavitra prakritik prem” kii prashansa karte hai jo dusron kii adhikarpurn irshyaa, jise blake ne “rengne vaale kankal” ke rup main mana he, se bandhaa nahin hota

 Edward Carpenter, a 19th-century intellectual of free love, was also influenced by Blake's mystic thought liberated by external restrictions
 aarambhik 20veen shatabdi main piyare barger ne yah bataaya ki kis prakaar blake ke drushtikon kartavya aadhaarit prem kii bajaae anandpurn sachche prem sambandhi mairi woolstencraft ke vichaar se, jisamen anandpurn sachche prem ko shuddhta kii sahi maap mana gaya he, milte hai
 Irene Langridge writes that according to Blake's mystic and non-orthodox view, the principle of free love is something that Blake seeks to elevate the "soul" of Michael David's 1977 book William Blake's New Kind of Man accepts that Blake's ideas In envy, the factor that distinguishes a man from the divine oneness is that due to which he falls down and participates in a cold death
 ek brahmavigyaani lekhak ke rup main blake main manushya kii "adhamsheeltaa" kaa bhav he
 s
 Foster Damon wrote that for Blake the major obstacles in the path of a free love society were the contaminated human nature and not only the intolerance of society and jealousy towards man but the false hypocritical nature of human communication
 Thomas Wright writes in his book Life of William Blake in 1928 that Blake thinks that in practice marriage should be based on the joy of love, but in reality it is not often because when the spouses feel tied up Then their happiness keeps on going
 piyare barger blake kii aarambhik mythkashastreey kavitaaon jaise ahainiya kaa vishleshan karte hue yah bataate hai ki vivaah ke niyam manushya ke ad:patan ke kaaran bane hai kyonki inkaa janm ahankaar or irshyaa se hota he
 Some scholars have written that Blake's views on "free love" are relative and may have changed and changed in the last years of his life
 is avadhi kii kuch kavitaayen jaise ki da sik rose balaat yonta ke khataron ke bare main aagaah karti hai
 Magnus Ancarzo writes that although the heroine of the Vision of the Daughters of Albion is an ardent supporter of free love, at the end of the poem her familiarity with the dark side of her sexuality increases as she becomes more cautious and shouts "can it be love that The other absorbs water like a sponge? " Ancarzo also writes that Mary Woolstoncraft, a major source of inspiration from Blake, holds similar, more cautious views about sexual freedom in the later days of her life

 Ancarzo discusses Blake's endorsement of a commune with fellow-partners, although David Worrell recently recited The Book of Thel as a rejection by some members of the Swedeburgian Church of the proposal to adopt keepers

 Berger finds that the young Blake puts more emphasis on following impulses and, with age, becomes a champion of the noble ideal of true love that involves true self-sacrifice

 Although Blake's attack on orthodox religion was a shocking thing in his time, his prohibition for righteousness was not in itself a prohibition of religion
 roodhiwaad ke prati unka drushtikon da marriage of hewan and hell, bible kii bhavishyavaanee kii nakal main likhe gaye paathon ke ek series se spasht hota he
 In it, Blake has given a list of several expressions of hell, including the following: da evarlasting gospel main blake isamsih ko darshanik athwa paaramparik maseehaa ke rup main na prastut kar ek sarvocch srujankaar ke rup main darshaya he jo siddhant, tark or yahaan tak ki naitikta se bhi pare hai: For Blake, Jesus symbolizes the life-long relationship between divinity and humanity and their unity: "the language of all was basically one and the religion of all was basically one: it was the religion of Jesus, the Everlasting Gospel
" Antiquity preaches the doctrine of Jesus Christ
 " Blake created his own myths which appear widely in his prophetic books
 inamen blake ne anek patron ko chitrit kiya he jinamein shaamil hai ‘eurigen’, ‘anithernan’, ‘bromian’ tathaa ‘luva’
 aisa lagata he is mythkashastra kaa aadhaar bible tathaa greek mythkashastra hai or evarlasting gospel ke bare main unke vichaar kaa yah anugaman karata he
 Blake's most strong opposition to orthodox Christianity is that it encourages the suppression of natural desires and condemns worldly pleasures
 a vijan of da last jajment main blake kehete hai: His statements about religion can be seen in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell: blake is dharna ko nahin maanate the ki aatma se sharir alag hota he or yah ki sharir ko aatma ke niyam ke adheen rahanaa chahie, balki isaki bajaae ve sharir ko aatma kaa vistaar maanate hai jo anubhutiyon / indriyon kii gocharata se vyutpann hota he
 Thus, the emphasis by conservatives on denying bodily desires is a dialectical defect born of a misinterpretation of the relation of body and soul; Elsewhere, he describes Satan as a 'state of guilt' and an object beyond salvation
 du:kha se chhutkaaraa, dushtatma ke astitv kii sweekruti or anyaay ke liye maafee dene vaale brahmavidya sambandhi vichaar ke kutark kaa blake ne virodh kiya
 He hated self-denial, which he considered religious repression, and especially sexual repression: "wisdom is a rich but ugly, old maid who pleads incompetence
" / vah jo ichha karata he kintu karm nahin, anarth ko janm detaa he
 "he has seen the concept of 'sin' as a snare that binds man's desires and he believed that the restriction against the moral ethics of externally charged moral ethics is against the spirit of life: god ez lord ke siddhant ko ve nahin maanate the jisamen ishwar ko manushya se alag or shreshth bataaya gaya he isamsih ke bare main unke shabdon se yah spasht hota he: “vahi ek maatr ishwar hai
 
 And that's me and that's you "
 The Marriage of Heaven and Hell has a saying "people have forgotten that the abode of all the gods is in the chest of man"
 This line is exactly in line with their belief of freedom and equality in society and between men and women
 prabodhan darshan ke saath blake kaa ek jatil sambandh tha
 Due to his imaginary religious beliefs, Blake opposed the Newtonist view of the universe
 blake ke is sambandh main vichaar unki rachana jerusalem ke uddhran main pratibimbit he: And there behold the Loom of Locke whose Woof rages dire Washd by the Water-wheels of Newton
 black the cloth In heavy wreathes folds over every Nation; cruel works of many Wheels i view, wheel without wheel, with cogs tyrannic moving by compulsion each other: not as those in Eden: which Wheel within Wheel in freedom revolve in harmony & peace
 blake kaa yah bhi vishwaas tha ki sar joshua reynolds ke chitra, jo vastuon ke upar prakaash ke prakritik aapatan ko darshaate hai, puri tarah “vanaspatik netra” kii upaj hai or ve lock tathaa newton ko “sar joshua reynolds ke saundarya shaastra ke vaastavik janak” maanate the
 Public interest in such paintings in England at that time was gratified by mezzotints, pictures that were produced by the process produced from thousands of tiny points at the top of the page
 blake ne iske or newton ke prakaash ke kan siddhant ke bich ek sadrishyata dekhi
 isi prakaar blake ne takanic kaa prayog kabhi nahin kiya iske bajaae unhone shuddh rup se taral rekha main nakkashi kii ek vidhi viksit karne ko tarjeeh diya
 ve is baat par ade rahe: Despite his opposition to the doctrines of Enlightenment, Blake thus arrived at a linear aesthetic that was more similar to the neoclassical carvings of John Flaxman than the works of the Romantic in many ways with which he is often classified
 isliye blake ko, is arth main, ki unka us aandolan dwaara vichaaron, vyavasthaaon, adhikaritaaon or paramparaon ko nakaarne kii pravriti ke saath saamanjasy tha, ek prabodhan kavi or kalakaar ke rup main bhi dekha gaya he
 On the other hand, he was also critical of what he believed to be the rise of the argument to a position of oppressive authority
 tark, kanoon or ekarupata kii apni aalochana main blake ko prabodhan ke virdohi ke rup main liya gaya he, lekin is baat par bhi bahes hui he ki boligat arth main unhone bahari praadhikaar ko nakaarne ke prabodhan ke utsaah ko prabodhan kii sankeern avadharna kii aalochana karne ke liye prayog kiya
 Northrop Fry commented on Blake's compatibility in strongly held opinions, writing that "blake himself has stated that his comments on Joshua Reynolds, written at age 50, are exactly the same as his comments on Locke and Bacon in his youth
 Are similar
 yahaan tak ki aayaton ke vaakyakhand or panktiyaan bhi waisi hi hai jaisi 40 saal baad kii
 jise vah satya maanate the use kaayam rakhane main susangati apane aap main unka pramukh siddhant tha
 

 Consistency, then, whether silly or something else was one of Blake's main presuppositions, in the same way that 'self-denial' has always been one of his most contemptuous criticisms "
 blake gulaami se nafrat karte the or unka vishwaas prajateey tathaa langik samanta main tha
 Many of his poems and paintings reflect the spirit of global humanity: "all human beings are equal"
 In one of his poems, Blake is told by a black child that white and black bodies are the same, such as shady gardens or clouds that only last until the person "learns to bear the rays of love": blake ne jivan bhar saamaajik or rajnatik ghatnaon main sakriy ruchi lee or saamaajik or rajnatik vaktavy praaia: unke rahasyatmak pratikwaad main dekhne ko milte hai
 His views on what he considers to be repression and restrictions on proper freedom spread to the Church
 unka aadhyatmik vishwaas songaz of experience se pramanit hota he jisamen ve old testament ke ishwar, jinke pratibandhon ko ve nakaarte hai or new testament ke ishwar, jinhen vah sakaaratmak prabhaav ke rup main dekhte hai, ke bich antar dikhaate hai
 From a young age, William Blake claims to have seen God
 aisa pehla darshan unhone chaar varsh kii umr main kiya tha, jiske bare main yah anushruti he ki yuva kalakaar ne "ishwar ko us samay dekha" jab ishwar kaa "sir unhen khidki par najar aayaa" tha, jise dekhakar blake chilla pade the
 At the age of eight or ten in London's Pekham Ray, Blake claimed to have seen "a tree laden with angels who had divine wings like every branch of the star"
 blake ke victorian jeevanikar gilcrist ke anusaar unhone ghar aakar is darshan ke bare main bataaya to, juthi baat kehane ke aarope main pita se maar khate-khate bache, vah bhi maa dwaara bich-bachaav karne par

 On another occasion, Blake saw a few shearers working and he seemed to have seen the divine figures moving between them
 blake ne jivan bhar divine drishy dikhaai padane kaa daawa kiya he
 They were often associated with beautiful religious themes and disinformation and hence they would be inspired by the creation and spiritual discovery of spiritual works
 Certainly religious concepts and disorganization have been central themes in Blake's works
 ishwar tathaa isai dharm unke lekhanon ke bauddhik kendra rahe hai, jisase unhen prerana milti thi
 In addition, Blake believed that he was personally guided and encouraged by the great angels for his artistic creations, which he claimed were actively read by the same angels and enjoyed by him Is raised

 In his letter to John Flaxman on 21 September 1800, Blake writes: adhyayan ke liye failfam shahar ek pyaari jagah he kyonki landan kii tulana main yah adhik aadhyatmik he
 The doors of heaven open here in every direction; His windows are not obstructed by fog; The voices of the inhabitants of heaven are heard more clearly and their forms appear more clearly; And my cottage is also a reflection of their homes

 In his letter to Thomas Butt on 25 April 1803, Blake writes: ab main aapse vah kah saktaa hum jo shaayad main kisi or se kehane kaa saahas nahin kar saktaa: ki main landan main akele apana darshanik adhyayan bina pareshaan hue jari rakh saktaa hum or paralok main apane mitron se baaten kar saktaa hum, sapane dekh saktaa hum, bhavishyavaaniyon kii kalpana kar saktaa hum or duusare nashwaron ke shakon se alakshith rah kar or swatantraapurvak nitiktha kah saktaa hum; shaayad dayalutaa se shaq nikalataa ho, lekin shaq hameshaa ghaatak hote hai, khaskar tab, jab ham apane doston par shaq karte hai
 In a Vision of the Last Judgment, Blake writes: galati kii jaati he, satya shaashvat galati he athwa sristi ko jala diya jayega or tab or na hi tab tak satya athwa shaashvat prakat hoga
 The moment a person stops watching it, it will burn
 i say to myself that i do not see the external creation and it is a hindrance to me, not a task; It is dust on my foot, not part of me
 The rising of the sun will be questioned whether you do not see round fire chakra like Guinea O, no i see with a myriad of heavenly hosts
 Holy shouts are holy, Almighty God, i do not ask the question now with the carnal or botanical eye
 Rather, i ask questions from the window through which the visuals appear

 Williams said that Blake was a romanticist whose views of the world were critical, his belief that Blake's Song of Innocence was created as an ideal, somewhat of a utopian perspective, while he wrote Songz The Experience was created to reflect the nature of society and the suffering caused by the world of their time

 Many, such as Jaune Singer, have argued that Blake's views on human nature are a precursor to and parallel to Carl Jung's ideas, although Jung describes Blake's works as "an artistic work rather than a true representative of unconscious processes

 Siddhartha's father was Shuddhodana, the king of the Shakyas
 paramparaagat katha ke anusaar, siddharth kii mata mahamaya unke janm ke kuch der baad mar gayi thi
 It is said that 8 sages were invited to name him, all told 2 possibilities, they will become a great king, they will become a monk or parivrajaka
 is bhavishya vaani ko sunakar raja shuddhodan ne apni yogyata kii had tak siddharth ko sadhu na banane dene kii bahut koshishen kii
 The Shakyas had their own union
 bees varsh kii aayu hone par har shakya tarun ko shakyasang main dikshit hokar sangh kaa sadsy bananaa hota tha
 When Siddhartha Gautam was twenty years old, he too joined the membership of Shakyasangh and according to the rules of Shakya Sangha, Siddhartha had spent eight years as a member of Shakya Sangha
 ve sangh ke atyant samarpit or pakke sadsy the
 He was very interested in the affairs of the Union
 sangh ke sadsy ke rup main unka aacharan ek udhaaharan tha or unhone swayan ko sabakaa priy bana liya tha
 In the eighth year of the membership of the Sangh, an incident occurred which became tragic for Shuddhodan's family and a critical situation was created in the life of Siddhartha
 shaakyon ke rajya kii seemaa se sata hua coliyon kaa rajya tha
 The Rohini River was the dividing line of the two states
 shakya or coliya donon hi rohinee nadi ke pani se apane-apane khet sinchate the
 They used to dispute between each crop on who would use Rohini's water first and how much
 ye vivaad kabhi-kabhi jhagade or ladaaiyon main badal jate the
 When Siddhartha was 28 years old, there was a fight between Shakya and the servants of Kolis over Rohini's water, injuring people on both sides
 jhagade kaa pataa chalane par shaakyon or coliyon ne sochaa ki kyon na is vivaad ko yuddh dwaara hameshaa ke liye hal kar liya jaye
 The commander of the Sakyas called a session of the Shakya Sangha to consider the question of declaration of war against the Kolis and proposed war to the Union
 siddharth gautam ne is prastaav kaa virodh kiya or kaha yuddh kisi prashn kaa samaadhaan nahin hota, yuddh se kisi uddeshy kii purti nahin hogi, isse ek duusare yuddh kaa bijaropan hoga
 Siddharth said that i propose that we choose two men from among us and ask the Kolis to choose two men
 phir ye chaaron milakar ek paanchavaa aadmi chune
 These five men together solve the quarrel
 siddharth kaa prastaav bahumat se amaanya ho gaya saath hi shakya senapati kaa yuddh kaa prastaav baari bahumat se paarit ho gaya
 Unable to resolve the dispute with Shakya Sangha and Shakya Senapati, Siddharth eventually had three options

 He was able to get proper attention, but he did not get answers to his questions

 Even in this work, he became more proficient than his teachers, but he could not find answers to his questions yet
 fir unhone kuch saathi ikaithe kiye or chal diye adhik kathor tapasya karne
 Doing so, after six years, without getting answers to their questions, having passed through death due to hunger, they started thinking of doing something else
 is samay, unhen apane bachapan kaa ek pal yaad aayaa, jab unke pita khet taiyaar karnaa shuru kar rahe the
 At that time, he had fallen into a blissful meditation and he felt as if time had come to a standstill
 kathor tapasya chhodkar unhone ashtangik maarg dhund nikaala, jo bich kaa maarg bhi kehalaata jaataa he kyonki yah maarg dono tapasya or asanyam kii paraakaashthaon ke bich main he
 To infuse some power into his body, he took some milk from a goat

 At the age of 35, he attained Bodhi and became a Buddha

 For the rest of his 45 years, Gautama Buddha gave his sermon around the river Ganges, to both the rich and the poor
 unhone do sanyaasiyon ke sangh kii bhi sthapana jinhone buddha ke dharmopadesh ko failaana jari rakhaa

 There is sorrow in birth, in old age, in sickness, in death, in getting away from loved ones, in things with dislike, in not getting desire, in everything
 trishna, yaa chahat, dukh kaa kaaran he or fir se sasharir karke sansar ko jari rakhti he

 Template: Main: Octagonal route buddha dharm ke anusaar, chauthe arya satya kaa arya ashtaang maarg he dukh nirodh paane kaa rasta
 Gautama Buddha used to say that to follow the truth of the Four Noble Truths, one should follow this path: 1
 samyak drushti : chaar arya satya main vishwaas karnaa 2
 samyak sankalp : maansik or naitik vikaas kii pratigya karnaa 3
 samyak vaak : hanikaarak baaten or jhut na bolnaa 4
 samyak karm : hanikaarak karmon ko na karnaa 5
 samyak jeevika : koi bhi pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se hanikaarak vyapaar na karnaa 6
 samyak prayaas : apane aap sudharne kii koshish karnaa 7
 samyak smriti : spasht gyaan se dekhne kii maansik yogyata paane kii koshish karnaa 8

 The knowledge found from Gautama Buddha is called Bodhi

 Bodhi can be attained only by the perfection of all the parameters, the complete understanding of the four Aryan truths and the prevention of karma
 is samay, lobh, dosha, moh, avidya, trishna or atmaa main vishwaas sab gaayab ho jate he
 There are three levels of Bodhi: ावकravakodhodhi, each Bodhādhi and Samyakasobodhi
 samyaksambodhi bodh dharm kii sabase unnat adarsh maani jaati he
 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 sabhi buddha sampradaay tathagat buddha ke mul siddhant hi maanate hai
 The theory of pratyatamutpad states that any event exists in a complex cause-and-consequence web only because of other events
 praaniyon ke liye, iskaa arth he karm or vipaak ke anusaar anant sansar kaa chakra
 Because everything is eternal and eternal, nothing really exists
 har ghatana multah shunaya hoti he
 However, humans, who have the power of knowledge, can attain nirvana by abandoning Trishna, which is the cause of sorrow, turning the power destroyed in Trishna into knowledge and meditation

 But elsewhere Buddha has called the supreme truth indescribable

 He values people of his own sect
 buddha dharm kaa matlab nirashavad nahin he
 Grief does not mean pessimism, but relativism and realism

 The Sangh occupies a large place in Buddhism
 is dharm main buddha, dhamm or sangh ko 'triratn' kaha jaataa he
 Regarding the rule of union, Gautama Buddha said that small rules can make monks change
 un ke mahaparinirvana pashchaat sangh kaa aakaar main vyapak vruddhi hua
 After this growth, different people became attached to Buddha religion on the basis of different region, culture, social stage, initiation, etc
 and the rule of the Sangh started changing gradually
 saath hi main angutar nikaay ke kalam sutt main buddha ne apane anubhav ke aadhaar par dharm paalan karne kii swatantrata di he
 Therefore, due to scandal / change in the law of Vinaya, local cultural / linguistic aspect, freedom of individual religion, more or less added to the definite side of religion, due to various reasons, various sects and associations in Buddha religion were scrapped

 shakti-santulan kaa siddhanth yah maanata he ki koi raashtra tab adhik surakshit hota he jab sainik kshamta is prakaar banty hui ho ki koi akelaa rajya itnaa shaktishaalee na ho ki vah akele anya rajyon ko dabaa de
 The concept of balance of power has been prevalent in the international stage since about the 15th century
 shaayad isiilie kuch lekhak ise antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa buniyadi siddhanth to kuch ise saarvajanik siddhanth yaa raajnneeti ke moulik siddhanth kii sangya dete hai
 In general terms, balance of power means when one state / group of states increases its power relative to another state / group of states so that it becomes equivalent to it
 parantu is dharna kii paribhaasha ko lekar vidyaman ekamat nahin hai
 Perhaps this is why Inins L
 Claude says that this is a concept that does not have a definition problem but rather that it has many definitions
 in paribhaashaon se pehle yah bataanaa bhi aavashyak he ki yah do prakaar kii hoti hai -saral evam jatil
 Simple or simple power balance occurs when the comparison is directly between two nations or between two nations
 lekin yadi yah santulan do samudaayon ke paraspar tathaa inamen sammilit samudaayon main aantarik rup main bhi ho tab yah jatil santulan kehalaata he
 In this context, scholars have given various definitions which are as follows- prayek raashtra yathasthiti ko banaaye rakhane athwa parivartit karne ke liye duusare raashton kii apeksha adhik shakti praapt karne kii aakanksha rakhata he
 As a result, the structure required is called balance of power
 shakti santulan vah samyavastha yaa antarrashtriya sambandh main kuch maatra main sthirataa yaa sthayitv he, jo rajyon ke bich maitra-sandhiyon yaa anya duusare sadhano kii madad se praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 The balance of power is the system under which every state constantly tries to maintain the belief that if states try aggression they will have to resist a group of invincible other nations
 shakti santulan se abhipraay raashton ke pariwaron ke sadasyon ke bich shakti kii nyaaypurna samyavastha se he jo kisi raashtra ko itnaa shaktishaalee hone se roktaa he taaki vah duusare raashtra par apni ichha lad na sake
 Thus, the balance of power has been seen by scholars from different countries
 koi ise shakti ke vitaran ke rup main dekhte hai to koi ise samoohon ke bich samyavastha ke rup main, koi ise sthayitv ke rup main, to koi ise yuddh va asthirataa ke rup main
 This is to say that these definitions lack consensus
 shaayad yah isliye hai ki shakti santulan ke anek arth / prayog hai jis vajah se yah bhranti bani hui he
 Mainly, the balance of power is used in four contexts - quinci rhit ke anusaar shakti santulan kaa siddhanth paanch manyataon par aadhaarit he- The balance of power has the following characteristics: saamaanya rup se yah yathasthiti banaae rakhane kii niti he, parantu vastav main yah hameshaa gatisheel va parivartaneey hoti he
 It is not a divine boon but it is the result of continuous human intervention
 yah vyaktiparak va vastunishth donon prakaar se paribhaashit hota he
 Historians always objectively assess it, while diplomats always subjectively analyze it
 yadhyapi yah shaanti sthapit karne kaa tantra he, parantu yah mushkil se hi kabhi shaanti sthapit karata he
 It is mainly a game of superpowers
 chote raashtra to maatra darshak kii bhoomika hi nibhaate hai
 An operator is needed for its correct operation which is absent in today's era
 yah samyavastha ke aadhaar par shaktiyon kaa samaan vitaran karata he
 But it is known from looking at the history of international politics that there has never been such a time
 shakti santulan kii vyavastha antarrashtriya raajnneeti main shaayad hi dashshtigochar ho, kyonki shakti tatv kaa maapna va sthir kar paanaa sambhav nahin he
 www
ncert
com shakti santulan kii sthapana hetu nimnlikhit tareekon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he- Sometimes big powers divide the land of small states for mutual power balance
 yah seemaa parivartan is aadhaar par kiya jaataa he ki aapasi shaktiyon main se koi bhi ek duusare se shaktishaalee na ban jaae
 In 1713, after the Treaty of Utrecht, Spain's land was divided between Bourbon and Hapsburg after the Treaty of Utrecht
 isi prakaar poland ko teen baar main is prakaar vibhajit kiya gaya ki shakti santulan na bigade
 Similarly, in the 18th and 19th centuries, various treaties were made keeping this view in mind
 maitri sandhiyaan bhi shakti santulan kaa pramukh saadhan rahi he
 But when a nation increases its power through Maitra treaties, then other states also become apprehensive and start making treaties with each other
 is kram kaa ant vishwa ke sabhi raashton dwaara virdohi guton main sangathit hokar hota he
 This type of Maitra treaties and the era of Maitra treaties are commonly seen in the politics of Europe
 udhaahranswaroop 1882 ke trirashtriya sandhi ke gathan ke virodh swaroop anya rashtron ke bich bhi virdohi trirashtriya maitri sandhiyon par sahmati hui taaki europe kii raajnneeti main santulan banaaya ja sake
 Similar examples emerged in the form of alliances established between the superpowers after World War II
 shastreekaran shakti kaa pratyaksh evam agratam rup he
 That is why among the states, especially from their rival, there is a competition to store weapons
 is sanchay se unki sainya shakti kaa vikaas hota he tathaa apane virodhiyon par dabaav badhaane ke kaam aata he
 But the other nation or group of states also does not want to be left behind, so both want to balance each other
 udhaahranswaroop, shityudh yug main purv soviet sangh va america ke bich shastreekaran hi donon dwaara ek duusare ko santulit karne kaa madhyam rahaa he
 Along with international political armament, disarmament also sometimes works to balance between the powers
 jab shastreekaran ek charam seemaa ke baad aage badhanaa sambhav na rah sake tab shaktiyaan nirastrikaran kii taraf kadam badhaati he
 As an example, the Salt-1 Salt-2 Start-1 and Start-2 INF Treaty etc
 agreements between the two superpowers are proof of this
 anya raashton ke bich bhi vartmaan samay main shastrakaran se tang aakar vishwasaneeyata badhaane vaale kadamon kaa uthaaya janaa iskaa pramaan he
 Many times the two powers maintain a mutual balance by avoiding any direct confrontation and keeping any one state at the center
 atah aisa kamjor va tatasth rajya hameshaa do badi takaton ke bich yuddh kii sambhaavnaaen tali rahane ke saath-saath shakti santulan bhi bana rahata he
 For example, for a long time Poland remained an intermediate state between Russia and Germany
 afghanistan, rus va england ke bich is sthiti main kaaphi der tak rahaa
 Sometimes two non-allies divide the intermediate region equally
 aisi sthiti main madhyavarti kshetron kaa prabhaav nunatam ho jaataa he
 For example, the partition of Germany, Korea, indo-china
 vartmaan antarrashtriya raajnneeti ye kshetra samaapt praaia ho gayi hai
 Therefore, their effect has also become negligible for the balance of power
 hastkshep kii niti hameshaa shaktishaalee raashton dwaara duusare ke maamle main dakhlandaji karke apane prabhaav ko badhaane se he
 Its purpose is in the form of continuation or change of a regime there by the big nation
 is saadhan ke madhyam se shakti santulan banaaye rakhane kaa prayaas hota he
 It was used extensively by both the superpowers during the Cold War period
 purv soviet sangh ne jahaan hungary, checkoslovakia va afghanistan main hastkshep kiya, vahiin america ne grrenada, cuba, nikaragua, korea, iraq, afghanistan aadi main hastkshep kiya he
 The policy of balancing laissez-faire has generally been adopted by smaller nations
 isse chote rajyon dwaara tatastha ke rup main apanaaya gaya he
 In some circumstances, even large nations have resorted to it
 zyaadaatar asia, africa evam latin america deshon ne gut nirpekshata kii niti apanaakar ahastkshep niti kaa paalan kiya he
 Due to this, attempts to not fight or keep it limited or to give it its local form etc
 come under this
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti main badi takaton dwaara foot daalo, raaj karo kii niti kaa bhi anusaran kiya he
 Even by dividing the states into two opposing factions, the powers establish the balance of power in that region
 yah niti mukhya rup se britain dwaara apane samrajya ko ekikrut rakhane hetu kaaphi baar prayog kii gai
 The indo-pak partition of 1947 is a strong example of this
 is niti ke antargat apane pratidwandiyon ko kamjor karke santulan banane kaa prayaas kiye jate rahe hai
 In the Cold War period, the superpowers have also followed this type of policy in non-aligned countries
 yadi shakti santulan kaa moolyankan karen to yah spasht ho jaataa he ki is tareeke se shakti par purna simaaen to na lag saki
 Yes, to some extent this theory was successful in its objectives
 is siddhanth ke purna rup se shakti ke vikaas par ankush na laga paane ke nimnlikhit kaaran rahe- It is clear from the above thoughts that this principle is not fully capable of expanding power or preventing power struggle
 lekin iske madhyam se aanshik safalataa avashya milti he, kyonki - pratham, chote rajya apni suraksha aashwast kar sakate hai
 Second, it will also curb the establishment of the hegemony of a large power
 tritiy, yah yudhon ko bhi taalane main sakasham he
 Fourth, in the absence of any central authority over sovereign states, international law is also possible only with the balance of power
 atah yah kuch had tak shakti ke nirankush yaa aadhipaty sthapit karne kii sambhaawanaaon ko aanshik rup main rokane main sakasham he

 twachaa ke kisi bhaag ke asaamaanya avasthaa ko charmrog kehete hai
 Skin is the body's biggest system
 yah sidhe bahari vaataavaran ke sampark main hota he
 Apart from this, diseases of many other systems or organs are also expressed through the skin
 twachaa sharir kaa sabase vistrut ang he saath hi yah vah ang he jo bahya jagat ke sampark main rahata he
 This is why it is harmed by many things
 is haani kaa prabhaav sharir ke antarik avyavon par nahin padataa
 There are different types of skin diseases
 twachaa saralata se dekhi ja sakati he
 For this reason, its diseases, whether due to injury or infection, attract the attention of the patient immediately
 sunil== twachaa rogon ke vibhinn kaaran ==twachaa ke rog anek kaarnon se hote hai
 Before shedding light on these reasons, it is necessary to know that not every person has the same skin nor does it have the same effect on the same reasons
 twachaa sambandhi kuch rog janm se hote hai, jinka kaaran twachaa kaa kuvikas he
 These types of diseases attract the attention of the mother and others only after a few days of birth, for example red raised spots in which blood spills
 ye sharir ke kisi ang par nikal sakate hai
 These signs disappear on their own at the age of three to four years
 inaki kisi vishesh chikitsak se chikitsa karaani chahie, jisase koi kharaab, ubhara hua chihn na rah jaae
 Additionally, some humans have dry and fishy skin
 yah janm bhar aisi hi rahati he
 Such a person should not use soap
 kuch manushyon kii twachaa, bal or aankhon kaa svachh mandal shwet hota he
 Such a person is called sunflower, or colorless
 surya kii kirane inke liye atyant hanikaarak hoti hai, at: inhen sadaiv dhoop se bache rahanaa chahie tathaa dhoop main nikalate samay "dhoop kaa chashma" upyog main laana chahie
 Some diseases also occur due to physical causes on the skin, such as diseases caused due to pressure on the skin of an object and the effect of color, heat, coldness and x-rays
 twachaa par kathor dabaav ke kaaran thes pad jaati he jisamen dabaav ke kaaran pidaa hoti he
 Sometimes it has also been seen that the skin becomes thin due to constant pressure, such as bowel movement in ships
 isaki rokthaam ke liye kamaani pahante hai
 When wet, the skin shrinks and starts to disappear
 is tarah kii twachaa par sabun kaa bura prabhaav padataa he
 This type of skin is a washerman, a house worker, a hotel chef and a kitchen cleaner
 haath pair kii twachaa ke saath saath ungliyon or nakhun par bhi iskaa prabhaav padataa he
 Cold also has a bad effect on the skin, especially if the temperature is below zero
 adhik sheet se twachaa kii komal choti choti maheen raktavahani shirayen sikudne lagati hai tathaa twachaa neeli pad jaati he, in shiraaon main rakt jam jaataa he tathaa ang gal jaataa he
 This disease is called frost disease
 is kaa prabhaav kaan, naak or haath pair kii ungliyon par padataa he
 Knowledge of first aid of this disease is very important for the soldiers who guard the mountain range
 jis ang kii twachaa par tusharrog kaa prabhaav ho usko aaraam se rakhana chahie tathaa saaf karne ke baad oonee kapade se lapet dena chahie
 Massage and fomentation are harmful
 adhik sheet ke kaaran kuch logon ke hath pair kii ungliyaan sooj jaati hai, laal pad jaati hai or unamem ghaav bhi ho jate hai
 To avoid this disease, nutritious food should be taken and fingers should be kept warm by wearing gloves
 yahan paushtik bhojan se taatpary adhik protein or vasayukta bhoj se he
 Chemical substances such as alkali and acid etc
 have a bad effect on the skin
 bharat samprati audyogikaran kii ore agrasar ho rahaa he, atev anek prakaar ke rasinic padaarthon kaa prayog anivaary he
 In such a situation, many skin diseases will be visible due to ill effects of these chemicals on the skin
 aadhunik samay main anya deshen main vyavsaayik twacharongon kii ore adhik dhyaan diya ja rahaa he
 While entering labor in an industrial organization, it is seen that the chemicals that are used in that industrial organization are not harmful to the workers
 duusari baat yah he ki aisi audyogic sansthaaon ke prabandhak evam chikitsak yah bhi dekhte hai ki samast karmchaaree uchit prakaar se haath paanv dhote hai or kaam ke pashchaat apane kapade badalte hai athwa nahin
 The clothes they wear and use chemicals should be changed immediately after work, so that the bad effects of those substances on the body do not last long
 aajkal pragatisheel deshon main audyogic sansthaayen in samast baton par puraa puraa dhyaan rakhti hai or is baat par bhi dhyaan detii hai ki kaarkaanon kii twachaa par bura prabhaav na daal saken
 The health of the employee is fully taken care of
 prayek karmchaaree kaa jivan beemaa hota he, jisase kaam ke madhya yadi vah rogagrast ho jaae to uski chikitsa uchit prakaar se ho sake
 The life insurance company pays the period for which he remains diseased and gets his medical treatment done
 iske atirikt, yadi yah siddh ho jaataa he ki karmchaaree ko koi rog kaarkaanon main kaary karte samay or vahaan kii kisi aisi vastu ko sparsh karne se hua he, jo hanikaarak he, to us factory yaa kaarkaane ke prabandhakon kii ore se kshatipurti ke rup main kuch dhan bhi karmchaaree ko dilaayaa jaataa he
 Most of the skin diseases are seen in our country, which occur due to not cleaning the body completely, poverty, non-continuous bathing and touching of the skin of diseased animals
 is prakaar ke rog chhot ke rog hote hai or ek duusare ke sansarg se lag jate hai
 Most of such diseases are itching, lice and ringworm etc
 log yah sochate hai ki in rogon ke jeevanuon ko maarane ke liye teevr se teevr aushadhiyon kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 This idea is pure and wrong
 aisa karne se twachaa ko bahut haani pahunchati he
 People should know that all those diseases, in which itching is a common prefix, occur due to different reasons
 khaaj ke liye gandhak kaa maraham bahut laabhadaayak he
 a doctor is needed for complete diagnosis of the disease
 gandhak ke maraham ko sharir par raat main lagaakar sona chahie
 Applying ointment thrice would be enough
 sir kii juun se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye sir kii safai karnaa tathaa baalo ko katwanaa chahie or di
di
tii
 yaa anya aushadhiyon kaa prayog chikitsak kii sanmati ke anusaar karen
 To get rid of itching and lice, other things do not benefit as much from the above mentioned medicines
 daad par aisa maraham na lagaana chahie, jo twachaa ko haani pahunchaae
 The disease is more commonly seen in sweaty areas
 is kaaran aise sthanon ko powder dwaara sookhaa rakhana chahie
 Also, ointment and powder should be used continuously for some time even after the curing of ringworm
 is rog ke liye abhi ek aisi aushadhi nikali he jo tikia ke rup main khai jaati he
 It is very beneficial for the disease
 ye rog kabhi kabhi pakanevaali khujali ke rup main hote hai or hamaari twachaa par jo jeevanu mitra ke samaan rahete hai, shatru ho jate hai
 Penicillin and sulfa ointment, such as cibazole, are harmful to kill these bacteria
 twachaa par rahanevaale jeevanu adhiktar apane aap hi twachaa ke rog kaa kaaran ho jate hai, jo phode, fusiyon ke rup main prakat hota he
 All these bacteria are hidden in a hiding place, such as a nose
 is kaaran yah aavashyak he ki chikitsa ke samay inpar bhi dhyaan diya jaay
 In the treatment of these diseases, food and medicine should be used
 jis jagah kii twachaa par ye rog prakat hon uski safai kaa puraa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 For these diseases, an ointment, wherein the doctor mixes zinc oxide, hydamon, iodoxiclavin, etc
, should be applied, and the use of sulfa and antibiotics in the mouth, or by injection
 madhumeh ke jeevanu atyadhik hanikaarak hote hai or karbonkal rog paidaa karte hai, jisaki chikitsa samajhadaari ke saath or tatkaal kerani chahie, jisase jivan ko koi haani na ho
 Apart from these, there are some other skin diseases, which are caused by very microorganisms
 inamen se ek rog ko gokharu kehete hai
 It is a contagious disease
 isi prakaar kaa ek or rog he, jise harpyszoster kehete hai
 It is not known why it is called a spider
 isamen sharir par chhaale pad jate hai or dard hota hai
 According to age, pain is experienced, that is, children suffer less and elders more
 ek anya rog harpes labielis or progenitellis bhi hota he
 These include blisters on the lips and penis after fever
 abhi tak in rogon ke vishaanuon ko maarane kii koi upyukt aushadhi gyaat nahin ho saki he
 Skin is an external component of the body
 is kaaran anek vastuon kaa prabhaav isapar padataa he
 This effect makes the skin very soft and sensitive and takes the form of eczema, or dermatitis, or urticaria
 in rogon kii uchit chikitsa ke liye yah jaananaa aavashyak he ki twachaa kis cheez se prabhavit hui he
 In the present period, many things affect the skin, among which the barber razor and the radiant things are the main ones
 twachaa hamaare sharir ke liye darpan ke samaan he, jisapar hansee, prasannataa, du:kha tathaa khinnata kaa prabhaav turant padataa he
 The reason for thirst is mental discomfort and sleeplessness
 twachaa par anya angon ke rog kaa bhi prabhaav padataa he, jaise madhumeh or pilia rogon main sharir par khujali ho jaati he
 The effects of the lack of essential substances in food also manifest as various diseases on the skin
 bhinn bhinn rogon ke liye anek davaayen di jaati hai
 New medicines are used every day
 bhinn bhinn aushadhiyon kaa adhik prayog kane se bhi tvagrog hota he, jise drug rash yaa drug chakatta kehete hai
 Skin diseases can also occur due to less sweating
 isi prakaar charbi kii granthi se bhi rog hote hai
 One of these diseases is called Muhansa, which is often seen in young boys and girls
 vastut: yah rog nahin he
 Due to the functioning of the sex glands at this age, the fat glands produce fat on their own
 jisko muhaanse kaa rog he use meetha, mirch tathaa masala kam khaanaa chahie
 Acne should not be scratched
 twachaa par bal bhi hote hai
 Sometimes the hairs of the head get more breakage
 iske liye sir kii safai or kisi sade tel kaa prayog laabhkar siddh hota he
 Sometimes young boys, the hair of the wood turns white at an early age, due to which they remain unhappy
 parantu abhi tak koi aushadhi aisi gyaat nahin ho pai he jiske prayog se yah rog thik ho sake
 Sometimes there is a possibility of causing great harm by applying Khizab etc
 kabhi kabhi sir yaa dadhi ke bal jagah jagah se ud jate hai
 Perhaps the reason for this is anxiety
 yadi rogi ko vishwaas dilaate rahen ki ude hue bal pun: aa jaayenge, to isse laabh hota he
 It is necessary to describe the skin as well as the nail
 nakhun main bhi twachaa ke samaan daad ho sakati he
 Sometimes nail polish breaks the nails quickly or becomes rough
 iske atirikt chintaa bhi twachaa kaa rog paidaa kar detii he
 The whitening of the skin is called white spots
 abhaagyavash isko kodh samajha jaataa he
 This makes the patient more anxious
 is rog main twachaa ko rooyee se chune se bhi sooyee chhedne jaisi pidaa hone lagati he
 But there is no pain in leprosy
 abhi tak is rog kii koi santoshjanak chikitsa gyaat nahin ho saki he
 Tuberculosis germs in the skin also produce dermatophytosis
 isi prakaar upadansh ke dhabbe bhi twachaa par prakat hote hai
 There are some skin diseases that reappear, such as psoriasis, the exact cause of which is unknown
 lupas arethematosus bhi aisa hi rog he
 If treated properly, most skin diseases are cured
 twachaa ke thode hi rog aise hote hai, jinase mrityu hoti he, jaise penfigus 
 In this disease, there are blisters on the body, mouth and secretions
 bhagyavash is rog main cotircesteroid se ek naveen aashaa utpann ho gai he or rog par bahut kuch aadhipaty paa liya gaya he, kintu rogi ko jivan bhar alp maatra main iskaa prayog karte rahanaa chahie
 Cancer can occur in every part of the body
 twachaa main bhi cancer ho saktaa he
 If the disease is diagnosed early and benefits from surgery, deep x-ray, radium or other treatment, then the age of the patient increases

 is sadan ko 1947 main british raaj ke samaapan ke pashchaat bharat kii swatantraaa va ganraajya kii sthapana ke baad visthapit kar diya gaya

 hindi main ise "rajkumaron kaa kaksh" athva "shahi / rajkeey kaksh" yaa "shahi sadan" ke rup main anuvaadit kiya ja saktaa he
 In English, "chamber" means "chamber", "cell" or "room", and "princess" means "prince" which denotes the state of an object
 "narendramandal / nareshmandal" shabd do sanskrit shabdon se bana he, "narendra / naresh" arthath 'shaasha' or "mandal" arthath 'samooh' yaa 'sabha'

 Raising sea levels, glacier retreat, arctic shrinkage, and altered patterns of agriculture are cited as direct consequences, but predictions for secondary and regional effects include extreme weather events, an expansion of tropical diseases, changes in the timing of seasonal patterns in ecosystems, and drastic economic impact
 chintaaon kaa netritv karne ke liye hai raajnneetik sakriyata prastaavon kii vakaalat karne ke liye kam, samaapt, yaa anukulit yah karne ke liye

 sambhavit jalwaayu parivartan ke kaaran global varming bhavishya bade paimaane par karne ke liye or sisa may mahadwipiya or vaishvik paimaane par sambhawatah aparivartaneey prabhaav
the likelihood, magnitude, and timing is uncertain and controversial, but some possible examples of climate changes include significant slowing of the ocean circulation that transports warm water to the North Atlantic, large reductions in the Greenland and West Antarctic Ice Sheet s, accelerated global warming due to carbon cycle feedbacks in the terrestrial biosphere, and releases of terrestrial carbon from permafrost regions and methane from hydrates in coastal sediments
 One or more of these changes is likely to increase the rate, with magnitude, and duration of climate change probability
