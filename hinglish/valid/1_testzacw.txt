 Industrialization, advanced transport, globalization, multinational corporations and outsourcing have all had a wide impact on the international trade system

 Without international trade, countries will be limited to goods and services produced within their own borders

 The main difference is that international trade is generally more expensive than domestic trade

 Another difference between domestic and international trade is that production factors such as capital and labor are generally more dynamic within countries than outside

 Instead of importing a factor of production, a country can import goods that make intensive use of the factor of production and thus include the related factor
 An example is the import of labor-intensive goods by the United States from China
 Rather than importing Chinese labor, the US is importing goods from China that are produced using Chinese labor
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, arthshaastra kii ek shakha bhi he, jo antarrashtriya vitt ke saath milakar antarrashtriya arthshaastra kii vistrut shakha kaa nirmaan karti he
 Several different models have been proposed to forecast the methodology of trade and to analyze the impact of trade policies such as tariffs
 ricardian model tulanaatmak laabh par kendrit he or antarrashtriya vyapaar siddhant main shaayad sabase mahatvapurn avadharana he
 In a Ricardian model, countries specialize in the production of the things they produce well
 anya modelon ke vipareet, ricardian dhaancha purvanumaan lagaataa he ki desh, maal kii ek vistrut shrunkhlaa kaa utpaadan karne ke bajaay visheshgy honge
 In addition, the Ricardian model does not directly consider factor funds, such as the relative amount of labor and capital within a country
 The major advantage of the Ricardin model is that it visualizes technology variations between countries
 praudyogiki antar, ricardian or ricardo-srapha model main aasaani se shaamil hota he 
 The Ricardian model makes the following assumptions: ricardian model laghu-avadhi main maapan karata he, isliye praudyogiki antarrashtriya str par bhinn hoti he
 This supports the fact that countries follow their comparative advantage and allow for specialization
 ricardian vyapaar model kaa adhyayan graham, jones, mekenzi or anya dwaara kiya gaya
 All principles excluded trade input goods such as intermediate goods, commodities and capital goods
 mekenji, jones or samuelson ne jor diya ki vyapaar se madhyavarti vastuon ko baahar rakhe jane se kaaphi laabh kho jayega
 ek prasiddh tippanee main mekenji ne kaha ki "ek pal kaa vichaar ek vyakti ko samajha degaa ki sooti kapade kaa utpaadan karne ke liye lankashair asambhavy hoga, yadi kapaas ko england main ugaana pade
 More recently, it expanded the theory to include the business intermediate case as well
 is prakaar "keval shram" dharna siddhant se nikaal di gai
 Thus the new Ricardian theory, sometimes named the ricardo-sraffa model, theoretically includes capital goods such as machines and materials, traded between countries
 vaishvik vyapaar ke samay main, yah dharna heksher-olin model kii apeksha adhik yathartwaadee he, jo yah maanata he ki puunji, desh ke andar sthir he or antarrashtriya str par gatisheel nahin he
 In the early 1900s, two Swedish economists, Eli Heckscher and Bertil Olin, created an international trade theory called the factor ratio theory
 is siddhant ko heksher-olin siddhant bhi kaha jaataa he
 The heckscher-olin theory emphasizes that countries should produce and export goods that require resources that are abundant and must import goods that require short-supply resources
 yah siddhant, tulanaatmak laabh or purna laabh ke siddhanton se bhinn he kyonki ye siddhant ek vishesh vastu ke liye utpaadan prakriya kii utpaadakta par kendrit hai
 In contrast, the heckscher-olin theory states that a country should specialize in production and export using factors that are most abundant and therefore cheap
 Do not produce those goods, as stated by earlier theories, which they produce most efficiently
 heksher-olin model ko buniyadi tulanaatmak laabh ke ricardian model ke liye ek vikalp ke rup main nirmit kiya gaya tha
 Despite its greater complexity, it did not prove to be more accurate in its forecasts
 lekin ek saidhantik drushtikon se dekhne par yah antarrashtriya vyapaar siddhant main nav-shastreey mulya tantra ko shaamil karke ek suruchipurna samaadhaan pradaan karata he
 This theory argues that the pattern of international trade is determined by differences in factor funds
 yah purvanumaan lagaataa he ki desh, un maalon kaa niryaat karenge, jo sthaneey rup se prachur karkon kaa upyog karte hai or un maalon kaa aayaat karenge, jo aise karkon kaa upyog karte hai jo sthaneey rup se atyant alp hai
 Empirical problems with the HO model, known as the Leontief paradox, were encountered in empirical tests by Vasily Leontief, who found that the US was exporting labor-intensive goods despite the abundance of capital
 H-O model nimnlikhit mukhya dharanaen banaata he: The problem with HO theory is that it does not involve the trade of capital goods
 In HO theory, labor and capital are constant substances for each country
 ek aadhunik arthvyavastha main, puunjigat vastuon kaa antarrashtriya str par kaarobaar kiya jaataa he
 Trade in intermediate goods benefits greatly, as emphasized by Samuelson
 kai arthshaastri ricardo siddhant kii tulana main heksher-olin siddhant ko pasand karte hai, kyonki yah kam saral dharanaon ko banaata he
 In 1953, Vecily Leontief published a study where he tested the validity of the heckscher-olin theory
 The study showed that the US was more abundant in capital than other countries, so the US was exporting capital-intensive goods and importing labor-intensive goods
 Leontief found that US exports were less capital-intensive than imports
 leontiff virodhabhas ke ubharne ke baad, kai shodhakartaaon ne heksher-olin siddhant ko bachaane kii koshish kii, yaa to maapan ke nae tareekon dwaara, yaa nai vyakhyaaon ke dwaara
 limar ne bal diya ki leontiff ne H-O siddhant kii sahi vyakhya nahin kii or daawa kiya ki ek sahi vyakhya ke saath virodhabhas ghatit nahin hua
 Brecher and Choudary found that, if Leamer was right, the per capita consumption of American workers should be lower than the world average of workers' consumption
 baad main kai anya pareekshan hue lekin unamem se zyaadaatar asafal rahe
 Many well-known textbook authors, including Krugman and Obstfeld and Bowen, Hollander, and VN, are negative about the validity of the HO model
 
 anubhavjanya anusandhan ke lambey itihaas kaa pareekshan karne ke baad, boven, holender or vien ne nishkarsh diya: "kaarak bahutayat siddhant ke haal ke pareekshan jo sidhe HOV samikarnon kii jaanch karte hai, ve siddhant kii asweekruti kaa bhi sanket dete hai"
 :321 The Heckscher – Olin theory has not been well adapted to analyze south – north trade problems
 HO ke anumaan, N-N vyapaar kii tulana main N-S ke sambandh main kam yathartwaadee hai
 The income difference between North and South is the one thing the Third World cares the most
 kaarak mulya samakaran ne vasuuli kaa adhik sanket nahin dikhaaya he
 The HO model assumes that similar production functions between countries
 yah behad avastavik he
 Differentiation of technology between developed and developing countries is a major concern for poor countries
 is model main, udyogon ke bich shram gatishiltaa sambhav he, jabaki alpavadhi main udyogon ke bich puunji sthir he
 Thus, this model can be interpreted as a 'short-term' version of the Heckscher – Olin model
 vishisht kaarak naam, pradaan kiye jane vaale ke liye yah sandarbhit karata he ki alpavadhi main, bhautik puunji jaise utpaadan ke vishisht kaarak udyogon ke bich aasaani se antarneey nahin hai
 The theory suggests that if there is an increase in the price of the goods, then the owners of the factor of production in the specific context of that goods will have real good advantage
 iske alaava, virdohi utpaadan ke vishisht karkon ke maalikon ke paas virdohi kaarysoochee hone kii sambhaavna hoti jab ve shram ke apravas par niyantran ke liye paksh jutate hai
 In contrast, owners of both capital and labor benefit realistically from the increase in capital funds

 This model is ideal for understanding income distribution but is naïve to discuss the method of trade

 Free trade is generally the most favored by the most economically strong countries, although they often engage in selective protectionism for industries that are strategically important, such as the US and Europe's imposition of agriculture
 a protective tariff
 The Netherlands and the United Kingdom were staunch advocates of free trade at the time when they were financially influential, today the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Japan being its biggest supporters
 haalanki, kai anya desh tezi se mukt vyapaar ke himachati banate ja rahe hai kyonki ve aarthik rup se khud adhik shaktishaalee ban rahe hai
 As the tariff level is declining, the desire to discuss non-tariff measures is also increasing, including foreign direct investment, recovery and trade facilitation
 Trade facilitation takes into account customs procedures and transaction costs related to carrying out trade

 During a recession, there is often excessive domestic pressure to increase tariffs to protect domestic industries

 In addition, domestic industry capabilities may not be a particular area nor the expertise to be successful in developing that field
 isliye, epadiai ki kshetra ke vikaas ke liye aavashyak ho jaataa he
 In addition, the opening of the economy is necessary for entry into the World Trade Organization or World Trade Organization, which means that in order to export to other countries, to open in emerging markets and developing economies

 However, a host of factors that do not continue the policies of the same governments include the ideological balance of governments, the compulsions of politics, and the fact that foreign investment may not succeed in kick-starting as a planned economy
 it depends on

 Flag pallav rajvansh pracheen dakshin bharat kaa ek rajvansh tha
 It established the kingdom at Kanchipuram in the fourth century and ruled the Tamil and Telugu regions for nearly 600 years
 bodhidharm isi rajvansh kaa tha jisane dhyaan yoga ko china main failaayaa
 This king considered himself a Kshatriya
 pallav gurjar rajvansh kuch vidwaanon ne pallvon kii utpatti parthian logon se batalaai he
 But the sound of both the Pallava and Pahlav names is not sufficient to prove it
 dakshini bharat main pahlvon ko uttarapath main or pallvon ko dakshinapath main rahanevaala kahkar donon main spasht antar dikhalaayaa he
 The word Pallava was originally the Sanskrit form of Tamil Tondair and Tondaman
 pallvon kii tamil utpatti maananevaale vidvan pallvon kaa tirayar or gurjar logon se sameekaran batalaate hai
 a scholar has unsuccessfully tried to prove the word Pallava as derived from the Tamil language, in the sense of milk milker or gule
 manimekhalai ke aadhaar par pratham pallav naresh ko ek chol gurjar or ek naag rajakanya kii satati maanane kaa bhi suzav rakhaa gaya he
 The Pallava nomenclature is said to be due to Manipallavam, the birthplace of Naga-raj-kanya or being tied to the genduri of Tondai Lata's branch of the first Pallava
 iske viruddh kuch vidvan pallvon kii uttari utpatti maanate hai
 According to Jaiswal the Pallavas were a branch of the Vakatakas; These were Kayasthas of the north who adopted military instinct
 pallav rajvansh ke upar uttari bharat kii saanskrithik paramparaon kii spasht chhap he
 They first use Prakrit and later Sanskrit

 His early governance is related to the Satavahana system and ultimately to the system propounded in economics
 kintu in sab se pallvon kii uttari utpatti kahan tak siddh hoti he, yah nishchay karnaa kathin he
 There are anecdotes relating the Pallavas to Brahmins Dronacharya and Ashwatthama, but in the Talagund inscription of Kadambas, the Pallavas are called Kshatriya Gurjars, which is also supported by Hiuen Tsang
 sambhavat: ve prarambh main satvahanon ke samant the
 They must have taken the Kanchi Pradesh from the snakes yah ghatana duusari shatabdi ke madhya ke baad kii hogi jab ki taalmi ke anusaar yahan naagon kaa adhikaar tha
 In some later inscriptions, the origin of the Pallava dynasty is told from Gujjars and Bhardwaj
 inamen ullikhit kuch praarambhik naam kaalpanik jaise lagate hai kintu kuch ghatnaon kaa aitihaasik aadhaar bhi sambhav he
 The early history of the Pallavas cannot be presented sequentially
 suvidha ke liye bhashaa ke aadhaar par unhen praakrit tamrapatton se gyaat or sanskrit tamrapatton se gyaat pallvon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 The first of these names is Singhvarman, whose Guntur inscription is of the last phase of the third century
 shivaskandavarman, jiske abhilekh mayidvolu or hirhadgalli se praapt hue hai, chauthi shatabdi ke aarambh main hua tha or praarambhik pallvon main sabase adhik prasiddh he
 At this time, the authority of the Pallavas extended from the Krishna River to southern Pennar and Bellary
 shivaskandavarman ne ashwamegh yajna kiya tha
 After that the kingdom of Skandavarman
 skandavarman ke guntur se praapt tamrapatt main, jo british museum main surakshit he yuvaraj buddhavarman or uske putr buddhyankur kaa ullekh he
 But the history after this is dark
 samudragupta ke dwaara parajeet kanchi ke naresh kaa naam vishnugope tha
 After this comes the reign of the Pallavas of Sanskrit Tamrapatta
 in abhilekhon se hamen kai pallav raajaaon ke naam gyaat hote hai kintu un sabhi kaa paraspar sambandh or kram nishchit karnaa kathin he
 Taking advantage of the differing power of the Kanchi dynasty, a feudal Pallava dynasty established its independent kingdom in the nellore-guntur region in the northern part of the Pallava Empire
 tamrapatton se gyaat is vansh ke shaskaon ko 375 se 575 i
 ke bich rakhaa ja saktaa he
 For the main house of Kanchi, we can first place Skandavarman, his son Kumaravishnu I, grandson Buddhavarman and great grandson Kumaravishnu II, known from Chendalur Tamrapatta
 skandavarman sambhavat: british musium ke tamrapatt kaa skandavarman ho
 After this, from Udayediram Tamrapatta comes the knowledge of Skandavarman, his son Singhvarman, grandson Skandavarman III and great grandson Nandivarman
 pehle ullikhit pallvon ke saath inkaa sambandh gyaat nahin he
 But Singhvarman's reign lasted from 436 to 458 AD
 singhvarman or uske putr skandavarman kaa ullekh unke samant gang logon ke abhilekhon main bhi aata he
 Shantivarman's name is known in the early sixth century
 sambhavat: yahi chanddand ke naam se bhi prasiddh tha or kadamb ravivarman ke dwaara maaraa gaya tha
 Singhvarman II ensures the status of the Pallavas
 pallav rajvansh ke gaurav kaa shriganesh uske putr singhvishnu ke dwaara hua
 Singhvishnu ended the political chaos created by the Kalabharas in the Tamil state and established the Pallavas' authority over the Chola Mandalam
 yah vishnu kaa upaask tha
 Avnasingh was his opponent

 The versatility of this great ruler developed in both the fields of war and peace
 isi samay pallvon or chalukyon ke sangharsh kaa prarambh hua
 The army of the Chalukya King Pulakeshin II reached near the capital Pallava, conquering
 pullalur ke yuddh main mahendravarman ne chalukyon ko parajeet kiya or samrajya ke kuch uttari bhaagon kaa chhodkar shesh sabhi kii punarvijay kar lee
 Mahendravarman wore many antics that point to several qualities of his talented personality, such as Mattavilas, Vichitkitta, Chethakari and Chitrakarpuli
 chattaanon ko katkar banawaye gaye iske madiron main se kuch trichinapali, mahendravadi or dalwanur main udhaaharan rup main avshisht hai
 He built a reservoir named mahendra-tatak at Mahendrawadi

 He composed the Mattavilas skit

 Nevertheless he encouraged the worship of Vishnu but he remained intolerant towards the Jains

 During this time the Pallavas became the dominant power of Southern India
 usne chalukya naresh pulakeshin dwitiya ke teen akramanon kaa vifal kar diya

 He made Mahabalipuram proud

 mahendravarman ke putr parameshwaravarman pratham kaa raajnneetik mahatv chalukya naresh vikramaditya kaa safal virodh karne main he
 Vikramaditya made a treaty with the Pandyas, the enemy of the Pallavas, and to counter the humiliation of his country, invaded the Pallava kingdom and conquered Kanchi and reached Uragpur on the southern bank of the Kaveri
 parameshwaravarman apni praarabhik asafalataaon se hatotsaah nahin hua
 To attract the attention of the opposition, he sent an army into the Chalukya kingdom, who defeated Vikramaditya's son Vinayaditya and grandson Vijayaditya
 usne swayan peruvalanallur ke yuddh main akramanakariyon ko parajeet kiya or unhen pallav samrajya chhodkar jaan par vivash kiya
 Some of the works of Mahabalipuram were made by him

 His temple is famous for its size and beauty

 Pandya Naresh Marvarman Rajasingh organized a group of several kingdoms against the Pallavas and, to help a man named Chitramayya, who called himself the son of Parameshvarman, attacked Nandivarman and surrounded him in Nandigram
 kintu pallvon ke senapati udayachandra ne nandigram kaa gheraa todaa, chitramaay ko markar or duusare virodhiyon ko parajeet kiya
 But Udayachandra, the commander of the Pallavas, broke the siege of Nandigram, killing Chitramaya and defeating other opponents
 kintu nandivarman kii sabase bhayankar vipatti chalukya naresh vikramaditya dwittiya kaa akraman tha
 With the help of the Ganges, he defeated the Pallavas around 740 AD and captured Kanchi
 kintu nagar kaa vidhwans na karke usne ulate janata ko daan or uphaar die or is prakaar pallvon ke adhikaar ko kunthit kiye bina unase badla liya

 kintu baad main shrimaar ne nandivarman or uske sahaayakon ko kumbhakonam ke sameep parajeet kiya
 a Tamil inscription derived from the Takua-pa place in Syam mentions the reservoir named Avininaranan and the Vishnu temple on the basis of its title

 He kept the boundaries of the "pallava Empire" intact
 usne abhilekhon se gyaat hota he ki shiksha or shashanprabandh ke kshetra main pallvon ne hi cholon ke liye bhoomika banaai thi
 Aparajit, the son of Nripatungavarman, was the last emperor of this dynasty
 pallvon ke samant aditya pratham ne apni shakti badhaai or 893 ke lagbhag aparajit ko parajeet kar pallav samrajya ko chol rajya main mila liya
 The Pallava Empire thus ceased to exist

 In the 13th century, a feudal named Kopperunjing tried to establish his independent authority
 yadhyapi vah apane ko pallav kahata tha, tathaapi usko pallav samraaton se sambadhit karnaa kathin he
 There can be no definite universally defined definition of modern democracy that incorporates the entire history and meaning hidden behind this word
 bhinn-bhinn yugon main vibhinn vichaarkon ne isaki alag alag paribhaashaayen kii hai, parantu yah sarvada sweekaar kiya he ki loktantreey vyavastha vah he jisamen janata kii samprabhutaa ho
 What the public means, how sovereignty should be and how possible, all these have been controversial topics
 phir bhi, jahaan tak loktantr kii paribhaasha kaa prashn he abraham linkan kii paribhaasha - loktantr janata kaa, janata ke liye or janata dwaara shashan - pramanik maani jaati he
 In democracy, the people are the ruling, rule with their permission, its progress is considered to be the sole goal of governance
 parantu loktantr keval ek vishisht prakaar kii shashan pranali hi nahin he varan ek vishesh prakaar ke raajnneetik sanghathan, saamaajik sanghathan, aarthik vyavastha tathaa ek naitik evam maansik bhaavana kaa naam bhi he
 Democracy is the overall philosophy of life, which covers all aspects of human beings in its widest circle
 loktantr kii aatma janata kii samprabhutaa he jisaki paribhaasha yugon ke saath badalati rahi he
 It has a centuries-long history behind the emergence of modern form
 yadhyapi roman samrajyavad ne loktantr ke vikaas main koi raajnneetik yogadan nahin kiya, parantu phir bhi romiya sabhyataa ke samay main hi stike vichaarkon ne aadhyatmik aadhaar par maanav samanta kaa samarthan kiya jo loktantreey vyavastha kaa mahaan gun he
 Cicero, Sineca and his predecessor philosophers were in a way creating the moral foundation of future democracy
 madhyayug main barahavin or terahavin shatabdi se hi rajtantr virdohi andolan or jan samprabhutaa ke beej dekhe ja sakate hai
 The Renaissance and Reformation reforms in Europe have contributed significantly to the development of democratic principles
 is andolan ne vyakti kii dharmik swatantraaa par jor diya tathaa raja kii shakti ko simit karne ke praytn kiye
 The four revolutions, England's Bloodless Revolution of 1688, the American Revolution of 1776, the French Revolution of 1789 and the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century are major contributors to stabilizing the present form of democracy
 england kii gauravpurn kranti ne yah nishchay kar diya ki prashaskeey niti evam rajya vidhiyon kii prishthbhumi main sansad kii sweekruti honi chahie
 The American Revolution also nurtured the principle of sovereignty
 francisi kranti ne swatantraaa, samanta or bhraatrutiv ke siddhant ko shakti di
 The Industrial Revolution inspired the application of the principle of democracy in the economic field
 saamanyat: loktantr-shashan-vyavastha do prakaar kii maani jaani he : The governance in which all the citizens of the country directly participate in the editing of the state work is called direct democracy
 is prakaar kaa loktantr main lokhit ke kaaryo main janata se vichaar vimarsh ke pashchaat hi koi faisla liya jaataa he
 The famous philosopher Rousseau considered this democracy as the ideal system
 is prakaar kaa loktantr pracheen yunaan ke nagar rajyon main paaya jaataa tha
 Currently direct democracy operates in Switzerland
 unaniyon ne apane loktantratmak siddhanton ko keval alpsankhyak unani nagarikon tak hi simit rakhaa
 Slaves, foreign residents and women settled in the Greek city states were denied political rights
 aajkal zyaadaatar deshon main pratinidhi loktantr yaa apratyaksh loktantr kaa hi prachaar he jisamen janabhaavana kii abhivyakti janata dwaara nirvaachit pratinidhiyon dwaara kii jaati he
 The people have no contribution in the governance and law making and the people reside under the system of governance chosen by the electoral system, not ruling themselves
 is prakaar kii vyavastha ko hi aadhunik loktantr kaa mul vichaar bataane waalon main matbhed he
 Nowadays, two types of traditional democratic organizations are generally accepted by electoral system - parliamentary and presidential
 sansadatmak vyavastha kaa tathy he ki janata ek nishchit avadhi ke liye sansad sadasyon kaa nirvachan karti he
 Cabinet is made by Parliament
 mantrimandal sansad ke prati uttaradaayi he or sadsy janata ke prati uttaradaayi hote he
 In the presidential system, the public elects the President and the President of the Executive
 ye donon ek duusare ke prati nahin balki sidhe or alag alag janata ke prati vidhinirmaan tathaa prashasan ke liye kramash: uttaradaayi hai
 Under this system of governance, the head of the nation is the real head
 is prakaar loktantr main samast shashanvyavastha kaa swaroop jan sahmati par aadhaarit maryaadit satta ke adarsh par vyavasthit hota he
 Democracy is not only limited to the form of governance, it is also an organization of society
 saamaajik adarsh ke rup main loktantr vah samaaj he jisamen koi visheshadhikaryukt varg nahin hota or na jati, dharm, varna, vansh, dhan, ling aadi ke aadhaar par vyakti vyakti ke bich bhedbhaav kiya jaataa he
 This type of democratic society can be called the basis of a democratic state
 raajnneetik loktantr kii safalataa ke liye uskaa aarthik loktantr se gathbandhan aavashyak he
 Economic democracy means that every member of society should get equal physical facilities for his development
 logon ke bich aarthik vishmata adhik na ho or ek vyakti duusare vyakti kaa shoshan na kar sake
 It is not possible to build a democratic nation in an environment of extreme poverty on the one hand and prolific prosperity on the other
 naitik adarsh evam maansik drushtikon ke rup main loktantr kaa arth maanav ke rup main maanav vyaktitv main aasthaa he

 Emperor Mihir Bhoja was the most powerful and great king of this dynasty
 arab lekhakon ne mihirbhoj ke kaal ko sampann kaal bataate hai
 Historians believe that the Gurjara Pratihara dynasty kept India from Arab attacks for almost 300 years, hence the name Gurjar Pratihara
 gurjar pratihaaron ne uttar bharat main jo samrajya banaaya, vah vistaar main harshavardhan ke samrajya se bhi bada or adhik sangathit tha
 The credit for creating an atmosphere of growth and progress in peace, prosperity and culture, literature and art etc

 Then under the leadership of Junaid, the governor of Sindh, the army moved forward to attack Malwa, Jurj and Avanti, where Jurj was captured
 parantu aage avanti par nagabhatta ne unhain khadaid diya
 Nagabhata's fame spread all around by defeating the invincible Arabs' army
 arabon ko khadedane ke baad nagabhatta vahiin na rukate hue aage badhate gayi
 And they extended their control east and south to the ports of Mandore, Gwalior, Malwa and Bharuch in Gujarat
 unhone malwa main avanti main apni rajdhani kii sthapana kii, or arabon ke vistaar ko roke rakhaa, jo sindh main swayan ko sthapit kar chuke the

 After the death of Harshavardhana, Kannauj faced a power vacuum, which resulted in the disintegration of Harsha's empire

 But his position also depended on an alliance with Lalitaditya Muktpeed
 jab muktapida ne yashovarman ko kamjor kar diya, to shahar par niyantran ke liye trikoniya sangharsh viksit hua, jisamen pashchim or uttar kshetra se pratihaar samrajya, purv se bengal ke paal samrajya or dakshin main dakkan main aadharbhoot rashtrakut samrajya shaamil the
 Vatsaraja successfully challenged and defeated the Pala ruler Dharmapala and the Rashtrakuta king Dantidurga for control of Kannauj and captured the two Rajashatras
 786 ke aasapaas, rashtrakut shaasha dhruv dharvarsh narmada nadi ko paar kar malwa pahunchaa or vahaan se kannauj par kabja karne kii koshish karne laga
 In about 800 AD, Vatsaraja was defeated by Dhruva Dharvarsha and forced to seek refuge in Marudesh
 or uske dwaar gaundraj se jite kshetron par bhi apana kabja kar liya
 Vatsaraja again had to rule from his old territory Jallon, with the repatriation of Dhruva, Pal Naresh Dharmapala captured Kannauj and made Chakrayudh king under him
 vatsaraj ke baad uskaa putr nagabhatta dwitiya raja bana, use shuru main rashtrakut shaasha govind tritiy ne parajeet kiya tha, lekin baad main vah apni shakti ko pun: badha kar rashtrakooton se malwa chin liya
 Accordingly, he defeated the kings of Andhra, Sindh, Vidarbha and Kalinga
 chakrayudh ko haraa kar kannauj par vijay praapt kar liya
 He went ahead and defeated Dharmapala and conquered the hill fort of Balpurvak Anarta, Malav, Kirat, Turushaka, Vatsa and Matsya
 shakambhari ke chaahmaanon ne kannoj ke gurjar pratiharon ki adheenta sweekaar kar lee
 He spread the Pratihara kingdom further to the Pataliputra in the Gangetic plain
 aage usne pashchim main punah musalamaanon ko roak diya
 He rebuilt the great Shiva temple of Somnath in Gujarat, which was broken from Sind into Arab hamlets
 kannauj gurjar-pratihaar rajya kaa centre ban gaya, apni shakti ke charmotkarsh ke dauraan adhiktar uttari bharat par inkaa adhikaar rahaa
 After the Strait of Nagabhata in 833 AD, his son Rambhadra or Ram Gurjar became the next king of the Pratihara Empire
 rambhadra ne sarvottam ghodo se susajjit apane samanto ke ghudsavaar saina ke bal par apane saare virodhiyo ko roke rakhaa
 However, he was facing tough challenges from the Devpal of the Pala empire
 or vah gurjar pratiharon se kalinger kshetra lene me safal rahaa
 After Rambhadra, his son Mihirbhoja or Bhoj i assumed the power of Gurjara Pratihara
 mihirbhoj kaa shasankaal pratihaar samrajya ke liye swarnakaal mana gaya he
 Arab writers describe the period of Mihirbhoja as a prosperous period
 mihirbhoj ke shasankaal me kannauj ke rajya kaa adhik vistaar hua
 His kingdom was spread in the north-west of Satulj, in the north the Himalayan foothills, in the east the western border of the Pala empire, in the south-east the border of Bundelkhand and Vatsa, Saurashtra in the south-west, and most of Rajasthan in the west
 isi samay paalvansh kaa shaasha devpal bhi bada yashasvi tha
 Therefore, many fierce wars took place between the two
 ant main is paal-pratihaar sanghars main bhoj ki vijay hui
 Amoghavarsha and Krishna II were ruling the Rashtrakuta at the time of Mihirbhoj towards the south
 atah is daur main gurjar pratihaar-rashtrakut ke bich shaanti hi rahi, halanki varato sangrahalayake ek khandit lekh se gyaat hota he ki avanti par adhikaar ke liye bhoj or rashtrakut raja krishna dwitiya ke bich narmada nadi ke paas yuddh hua tha
 In which the Rashtrakutas had to return
 avanti par gurjar pratihaaron kaa shashan bhoj ke kaarykaal se mahendrapal dwitiya ke shasankaal tak chalata rahaa
 After Mihir Bhoja his son Mahenderpal i became the new king
 In this period, empire expansion was halted but all its territories remained in authority
 is daur main kala or sahitya kaa bahut vistaar hua
 Mahendrapal appointed Rajashekhar as his regent
 isi dauraan "karpurmanjari" tathaa sanskrit naatak "balramayana" kaa abhinit kiya gaya
 The gurjara-pratihara empire had now attained its highest peak
 mahendrapal kii mrityu ke baad uttaradhikari kaa yuddh hua, or rashtrakuton ki madad se mahipal kaa sautela bhai bhoj dwitiya kannauj par adhikaar kar liya halanki yah alpakaal ke liye tha, rashtrakuton ke jate hi mahipal pratham ne bhoj dwitiya ke shashan ko ukhaad phenkaa
 Taking advantage of the temporary weakness of the gurjara-pratiharas, many feudalists of the empire especially the Parmars of Malwa, the Chandels of Bundelkhand, the Kalchuri of Mahakoshal, the Tomars and the Chauhans of Haryana began to become independent

 khilji vansh yaa khalji vansh madhyakaalin bharat kaa ek rajvansh tha
 It ruled Delhi from 1290-1320 AD
 dilli kii muslim sultanate main doosraa shaasha parivaar tha, haalanki kilji qabeela lambey samay se afghanistan main basaa hua tha, lekin apane purvavarti gulam vansh kii tarah yah rajvansh bhi mulat: turkistan kaa tha
 Its three rulers were known for their disloyalty, ruthlessness and authority over the South Indian Hindu states
 khalji vansh ke pehle sultan jilaluddin firoz khalji, gulam vansh ke antim kamazor badshaah kumarsh ke patan ke baad ek kuleen gut ke sahyog se gaddi par baithe
 Jalaludden was much older in age and was considered so unpopular at the time as an Afghan clan that he could not dare to venture into the capital
 unke bhattije june kaan ne dakkan ke hindu rajya par chadhaai karke elichpur or uske khazaane par qabza kar liya or phir 1296 main waapas lautakar unhone apane chachaa kii hatya kar di
 Juna Khan assumed the title of Alauddin Khalji and ruled for 20 years
 unhone ranthambhore, chittod or mandu par qabza kiya or devgiri ke samrudh hindu rajya ko apane rajya main mila liya
 He also gave a befitting reply to the Mongol invasion
 allaudin ke senapati malik kafoor ko 1308 main dakshin par qabza kar liya, krishna nadi ke dakshin main hoysal vansh ko ukhaad phenkaa or sudur dakshin main madurai par adhikaar kar liya
 When Malik Kafur returned to Delhi in 1311, he was laden with loot
 iske baad allaudin or vansh kaa sitara dub gaya
 The Sultan died in early 1316
 malik kafoor dwaara satta par qaabiz hone kii koshish unki mrityu ke saath hi samaapt hui
 The last Khalji ruler Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah was assassinated in 1320 by his Prime Minister Khusro Khan
 baad main tughlak vansh ke pratham shaasha gayasuddin tululaq ne khusro kaan se gaddi chhen lee
 Who was Khilji? There is substantial controversy in this subject
 itihaaskaar 'nizamuddin ahamed' ne kilji ko changez khaan kaa damaad or kuleen khaan kaa vanshaj, 'barani' ne use turkon se alag evam 'fakhruddin' ne khilgiyon ko turkon kii 64 jatiyon main se ek bataaya he
 Fakhruddin's view has been supported by most scholars
 chunki bharat aane se purv hi yah jati afghanistan ke helemand nadi ke tateey kshetron ke un bhaagon main rahati thi, jise kilji ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Probably that is why this caste was called Khilji
 maamluk athwa ghulaam vansh ke antim sultan shamsuddin kumors kii hatya ke baad hi jilaluddin firoj kilji singhaasana par baitha tha, isliye itihaas main kilji vansh kii sthapana ko kilji kranti ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 The Khilji revolution is not only important because it ended the Ghulam dynasty and established the new Khilji dynasty, but it is also important that the Khilji revolution resulted in the expansion of the Delhi Sultanate to the south
 jatvaad main kami ai or saath hi yah dharna bhi khatm hui ki, shashan keval vishishti varg kaa vyakti hi kar saktaa he
 Khilji belonged mainly to the proletariat
 kilji yug samrajyavad or muslim shakti ke vistaar kaa yug tha
 After this revolution the sphere of influence of the Turkish wealthy chieftains decreased
 is kranti ne prashasan main dharm va ulema ke mahatva ko bhi asweekaar kar diya
 Thus the power of the Khilji rulers depended mainly on power
 khilgiyon ne yah siddh kar diya ki, rajya bina dharm kii sahaayta se na keval jivit rakhaa ja saktaa he, balki safaltaapurvak chalaaya bhi ja saktaa he
 Jalaluddin Khilji's handling of the throne marks the end of the Mamluk dynasty and the domination of the Ottoman slave elite
 kilji vansh ko saamanyat: turkon kaa ek kabila mana jaataa he, jo uttari bharat par musalamaanon kii vijay ke baad yahan aakar bas gaya
 Jalaluddin Khilji established the Khilji dynasty
 jilaluddin kilji ne ghulaam vansh ke antim sultan kii hatya karke khilgiyon ko dilli kaa sultan banaaya
 The Khilji dynasty ruled from 1290 to 1320 AD
 dilli ke kilji sultaanon main allaudin kilji sabase prasiddh or yogya shaasha tha
 There were three rulers in total - allaudin khilji ne apane samrajya ko dakshin kii disha main badhaayaa
 His empire had failed to the south of the Kaveri River
 uske shasankaal main mongol akraman bhi hue the par usne mongolon kii apekshaakrit kamjor sena kaa datakar saamana kiya

 yah gaanv tatkaaleen gwalior rajya main chambal nadi ke bihadon ke bich sthit tomarsghar kshetra ke muraina jile main tha or vartmaan main yah madhya pradesh main he
 The residents of Barabai village used to harass the villagers with British and English hegemony
 paariwarik kalah ke kaaran narayan laal ne apni patni vichitra devi evam donon putron - muralidhar va kalyanmal sahit apana paitruk gaanv chhod diya
 After leaving his village, only two of his brothers - Aman Singh and Saman Singh - remained in Barabai, whose descendants still live in the same village

 Later, this family moved to Shahjahanpur, the historical city of Uttar Pradesh
 shahjahanpur main munnuganj ke phatak ke paas sthit ek attaar kii dukaan par maatr teen rupee masik main narayan laal ne naukari kar lee
 His family did not have the support of so little money
 bismil kii daadi vichitra devi ne apane pati kaa haath bataane ke liye anaaj pisane kaa kaary shuru kar diya
 This sequence continued for about two-three years
 unke aachaar-vichaar, tyanishtha va dharmik pravriti se sthaneey log praayah unhen "pandit ji" kahkar sambodhit karte the
 He also had a benefit from this that on every Teej - festival, donations - Dakshina and food etc
 would come to the house
 isi bich narayan laal ko sthaneey nivaasiyon kii sahaayta se ek paathshaala main saat rupee masik par naukari mil gayi
 After some time he also quit this job and started the business of selling Regari
 isse unhen pratidin paanch-saat aane kii aay hone lagi
 Narayan Lal also bought a house to live in Khirnibagh locality of the city and married the eldest son Muralidhar to a daughter of his in-laws' family, Mudmati, and brought him to this new house
 shaadi pashchaat muralidhar ko shahjahanpur kii nagarpalika main 15 rupee masik vetan par naukari mil gayi
 But he did not like this job

 He earned a lot of money in this business

 Born on 11 June 1897 in Khirnibagh locality of Shahjahanpur city in Uttar Pradesh, Ramprasad was the second child of his father Muralidhar and mother Moolmati
 unase purv ek putr paidaa hote hi mar chukaa tha
 Seeing the traces of the cycle in the child's horoscope and the two fingers of both hands, an astrologer predicted - "if the child's life is somehow saved, although the chances are very low, then it will be possible to make any person in the world Strength will not stop
 '' mata-pita donon hi singh raashi ke the or baccha bhi singh-shaavak jaisaa lagata tha atah jyotishiyon ne bahut soch vichaar kar tula raashi ke namakshar r par naam rakhane kaa suzav diya
 Both parents were worshipers of Rama, so the child was named Ramprasad
 maan moolmati to sadaiv yahi kahati thim ki unhen ram jaisaa putr chaiye tha
 Everyone in the house used to call the child lovingly as Rama
 ramprasad ke janm se purv unki maan ek putr kho chuki thim atah jaadu-tone kaa sahaara bhi liya gaya
 a rabbit was brought and removed from the top of the newborn child into the courtyard
 khargosh ne aangan ke do-chaar chakkar lagaaye or fouran mar gaya
 It is mentioned by Ram Prasad Bismil in his autobiography
 muralidhar ke kul 9 santaanen huin jinamein paanch putriyaan evam chaar putr the
 Later, two daughters and two sons also died
 balykaal se hi ramprasad kii shiksha par vishesh dhyaan diya jane laga
 His mind was more in play but less in reading
 iske kaaran unke pitaaji to uski khub pitai lagaate parantu maan hameshaa pyaar se yahi samajhaati ki "betaa ram! ye bahut buree baat he mat kiya karo
 "this loving learning must have had some effect on his mind
 uske pita ne pehle hindi kaa akshar-bodh karaayaa kintu u se ullu na to unhone padhanaa siikhaa or na hi likhakar dikhaaya
 In those days only the owl was taught in Hindi alphabet
 is baat kaa vah virodh karte the or badale main pita kii maar bhi khate the
 Defeated, he was admitted to the Urdu school
 shaayad yahi prakritik gun ramprasad ko ek krantikari bana paye
 At the age of 14, Ramprasad got addicted to stealing money from his father's ark
 churaaye gayi rupayon se unhone upanyaas aadi kharidkar padhanaa prarambh kar diya evam cigarette pine va bhang chadhaane kii aadat bhi pad gayi thi
 Overall, the trend of money-theft continued and Ramprasad was now used to reading books of novels and ghazals filled with Urdu premiers
 sanyog se ek din bhang ke nashe main hone ke kaaran ramprasad ko chori karte hue pakad liya gaya
 Plenty of beating, novels and other books were torn but the habit of stealing money was not lost
 aage chalakar jab unako thodi samaj aayi tabhi ve is durgun se mukt ho sake
 Ramprasad started studying English when he did not pass the Urdu Middle examination
 saath hi pados ke ek pujari ne ramprasad ko puja-paath kii vidhi kaa gyaan karvaa diya
 The priest was a settled scholar
 unke vyaktitv kaa prabhaav ramprasad ke jivan par bhi padaa
 Due to the teachings of the priest, Ramprasad began to practice celibacy with the recitation
 pujari kii dekha-dekhi ramprasad ne vyaayaam karnaa bhi prarambh kar diya
 All the misgivings and bad habits of adolescence were in mind
 keval cigarette pine kii lat nahin chhuti
 But she too, after a few days, escaped from the discord of Sushil Chandra Sen, a schoolmate
 cigarette chhootane ke baad ramprasad kaa man padhai main lagane laga
 Very soon he entered the fifth record of English
 ramprasad main apratyaashit parivartan ho chukaa tha
 The body had become handsome and robust
 niyamit puja-paath main samay vyateet hone laga tha
 During this time he got in touch with Munshi Indrajit who came to the temple
 munshi indrajit ne ramprasad ko arya samaaj ke sambandh main bataaya or swami dayanand saraswati kii likhi pustak satyarth prakaash padhane ko di
 The serious study of Satyarth Prakash had a surprising impact on Ramprasad's life
 ramprasad jab government skool shahjahanpur main aathvin kaksha ke chaatr the tabhi sanyog se swami somdev kaa arya samaaj bhawan main aagaman hua
 Munshi Indrajit appointed Ramprasad to Swamiji's service
 yaheen se unke jivan kii dasha or disha donon main parivartan prarambh hua
 a serious study of Satyarth Prakash on the one hand and an open discussion on political subjects with Swami Somdev on the other hand aroused the feeling of patriotism in his mind
 san 1916 ke congress adhiveshan main swagatadhyaksh pan jagat narayan 'mullah' ke aadesh kii dhajjiyaan bikherte hue ramprasad ne jab lokmaanya balgangadhar tilak kii puure lakhanu shahar main shobhaayatra nikaali to sabhi navayuvakon kaa dhyaan unki dridhta kii ore gaya
 During the session, he was introduced to Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, Somdev Sharma and Mukundilal etc

 This book was published in 1916 in Kurmi Press, Lucknow under the management of Babu Ganeshprasad
 ramprasad ne yah pustak apni mataji se do baar main do-do sau rupee lekar prakashit kii thi
 He has mentioned this in his autobiography
 yah pustak chhapate hi jabt kar lee gayi thi baad main jab kakori kand kaa abhiyog chalaa to sakshya ke rup main yahi pustak prastut kii gayi thi
 Now this book has been edited and compiled in part-three of Sarfaroshi's book titled Tamanna and can be seen in many other libraries including Teen Murti Bhawan Library, New Delhi
 san 1915 main bhai parmanand kii phaansi kaa samachar sunakar ramprasad british samrajya ko samul nasht karne kii pratigya kar chuke the, 1916 main ek pustak chhapakar aa chuki thi, kuch navayuvak unase jud chuke the, swami somdev kaa aashirwad bhi unhen praapt ho chukaa tha
 He formed an organization under the guidance of Pandit Gandalal Dixit under the name Matriwadi
 is sanghathan kii ore se ek ishtihaar or ek pratigya bhi prakashit kii gayi
 In order to collect funds for the party, Ramprasad, who had become famous as 'bismil' till now, also committed two robberies in June 1918 and one in September 1918, making the police alert of these youths
 There were raids all over the place in search
 26 se 31 disambar 1918 tak dilli main laal kile ke saamne hue congress adhiveshan main is sanghathan ke navayuvakon ne chilla-chilla kar jaise hi pustaken bechnaa shuru kiya ki police ne chapa daalaa kintu bismil kii sujh boojh se sabhi pustaken batch gayin

 When obsessed with patriotism, then an organization was formed in the name of Shivaji Committee and started collecting weapons

 The people who were imprisoned in the fort got duped by the police

 Once caught again, the police were left behind, fled to Delhi where he died
 bismil ne apni aatmakatha main pandit gendalal ji kaa bada maarmik varnan kiya he
 6 men from Shahjahanpur were involved in the Mainpuri conspiracy, whose leader was Ramprasad Bismil, but they did not come in the hands of the police, they fled immediately
 1 nabambar 1919 ko magistrate bi es kris ne mainpuri shadyantra kaa faisla suna diya
 Among those who were decorated, except for Mukundilal, in February 1920, the general amnesty was released
 bismil puure 2 varsh bhumigat rahe
 Some of his teammates went to Shahjahanpur and spread the rumor that Bhai Ramprasad was killed by a police bullet while the truth was that he jumped in the Yamuna during the police encounter and floated miles inside the water with the power of yoga practice
 Going far ahead, came out of the river and where the Greater Noida is inhabited nowadays, the uninhabited people went to the ravines
 vahaan un dinon keval babul ke hi vriksh hua karte the; or oosar jameen main aadmi to kahin dur-dur tak dikhataa hi nahin tha
 Ram Prasad Bismil took refuge in Rampur Jagir, a small village here and roamed in the uninhabited forests for several months, grazing the cow buffalo of the village goose
 iskaa bada hi rochak varnan unhone apni aatmakatha ke dwitiya khand : swadesh prem main kiya he
 While living here, he wrote his revolutionary novel, The Action of the Bolsheviks
 vastutah yah upanyaas mularoop se bangla bhashaa main likhit pustak nihilist-rahasy kaa hindi - anuwaad he jisaki bhashaa or style donon hi badi rochak hai
 a very good Bengali book of Arvind Ghosh, Hindi translation of the compound instrument was also done while he was underground
 yamuna kinare kii jameen un dinon police se bachane ke liye surakshit samajhi jaati thi at: bismil ne us niraapad sthaan kaa bharpoor upyog kiya
 At present, since this village comes under the Beta Forest Sector of Greater Noida, the Government of Uttar Pradesh has developed the immortal Shaheed Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil Udyan in the memory of the Forest Department's reserved land in the area of rampur Jagir village
 Which is supervised by the Forest Department of the state with the funding of Greater Noida Administration
 'bismil' kii ek visheshta yah bhi thi ki ve kisi bhi sthaan par adhik dinon tak thaharte nahin the
 Staying at Rampur Jagir for a few days, he also stayed in Kosma District Mainpuri, the village of his real sister Shastri Devi
 maje kii baat yah ki unki apni bahan tak unhen pahchaan nahin paayin
 Walked out of Kosma and reached Bah
 kuch din bah rahe phir vahaan se pinahat, agra hote hue gwalior riyasat sthit apane dada ke gaanv barbai chale gayi
 He also ran a plow for a few days there in disguise of the farmer

 All his colleagues liked this book very much
 is pustak kaa naam unhone catherine rakhaa tha
 Not only this, Bismil had also published a few books from the Sushilmala series which included a collection of poems called Mind Wave, a concise biography of Catharine or the Goddess of Independence - Catharine Brashkovsky, Indigenous Colors and Novels of the aforementioned Bolsheviks
 swadeshi rang ke atirikt anya teenon pustaken aam pathakon ke liye aajkal pustakaalayon main uplabdh hai
 After the government announcement, Ram Prasad Bismil came to his hometown Shahjahanpur and worked for a few days as a manager in the first Bharat Silk Manufacturing Company, after that he opened a business of silk sarees in Sadar Bazar and started business with Banarasilal
 vyapaar main unhone naam or namaa donon kamaaya
 The Congressional District Committee took him to the Executive Committee for the post of Auditor
 sitambar 1920 main ve kalakatta congress main shahjahanpur congress cameti ke adhikrut pratinidhi ke rup main shaamil hue
 In Calcutta, he met Lala Lajpat Rai
 lala ji ne jab unki likhi hui pustaken dekhin to ve unase kaaphi prabhavit hue
 He introduced him to some publishers in Calcutta, including one Ummadatta Sharma, who later published a book titled Catharine by Ram Prasad Bismil in 1922
 san 1921 ke ahmedabad congress adhiveshan main ramprasad'bismil' ne purna swaraj ke prastaav par moulana hasarat mohani kaa khulkar samarthan kiya or antatogatva gandhi ji se asahyog aandolan prarambh karne kaa prastaav paarit karvaa kar hi maane
 Due to this he became very popular among the youth
 samooche desh main asahyog aandolan shuru karne main shahjahanpur ke swayamsevakon kii aham bhoomika thi
 But when Gandhiji withdrew the non-cooperation movement after consulting Chauri Chaura in 1922, in the Congress of 1922, Bismil and his colleagues opposed Gandhiji in such a way that two ideologies were formed in the Congress again - a liberal or Liberals and Second Rebel or Rebellion
 gandhi ji vidrohi vichaardhaara ke navayuvakon ko congress kii aam sabhaaon main virodh karne ke kaaran hameshaa hulladbaj kaha karte the
 At one time he wrote a letter to Jawaharlal Nehru and severely reprimanded for supporting the revolutionary youth
 janvari 1923 main motilal nehru va deshbandhu chitaranjan das sareekhe dhanadhy logon ne milakar swaraj party bana lee
 The young men announced the Revolutionary Party as the ad hoc party
 sitambar 1923 main hue dilli ke vishesh congress adhiveshan main asantusht navayuvakon ne yah nirnay liya ki ve bhi apni party kaa naam va samvidhan aadi nishchit kar raajnneeti main dakhal dena shuru karenge anyathaa desh main loktantr ke naam par luutatantra haaavee ho jaayegaa
 If seen, it was his great visionary thinking at that time
 suprasiddh krantikari lala hardayal, jo un dinon videsh main rahakar hindustan ko swatantra karaane kii ranneeti banane main jute hue the, ram prasad bismil ke sampark main swami somdev ke samay se hi the
 Lala ji had written a letter to Ram Prasad Bismil and advised him to prepare the constitution of the new party by meeting Shachindranath Sanyal and Yadu Gopal Mukherjee
 lala ji kii salaah maanakar ram prasad elahabaad gayi or shachindranath sanyaal ke ghar par party kaa samvidhan taiyaar kiya
 The name of the newly formed party was abbreviated as HRA and its constitution was printed on yellow leaflet and sent to the members
 3 oktober 1924 ko is party kii ek kaaryakarini-baithak kanpur main kii gayi jisamen shachindranath sanyaal, yogesh chandra chatarji va ram prasad bismil aadi kai pramukh sadsy shaamil hue
 In this meeting, Sanyal and Chatterjee went to Bengal by handing over the leadership of the party to Bismil
 party ke liye fund ekatra karne main kathinaayee ko dekhte hue ireland ke krantikariyon kaa tarika apanaaya gaya or party kii ore se pehali dakaiti 25 disambar 1924 ko bamrauli main daali gayi jiskaa kushal netritv bismil ne kiya tha
 This is mentioned in the decision of the Chief Court of Oudh
 krantikari party kii ore se 1 janvari 1925 ko kisi gumnaam jagah se prakashit evam 28 se 31 janvari 1925 ke bich samooche hindustan ke sabhi pramukh sthanon par vitarit 4 prishth ke pamfalet "di revolutionari" main ram prasad bismil ne vijay kumaar ke chhadam naam se apane dal kii vichaar-dhara kaa likhit rup main khulaasa karte hue saaf shabdon main ghoshit kar diya tha ki krantikari is desh kii shashan vyavastha main kis prakaar kaa badlaav karnaa chaahate hai or iske liye ve kya-kya kar sakate hai? keval itnaa hi nahin, unhone gandhi ji kii nitiyon kaa majaak banaate hue yah prashn bhi kiya tha ki jo vyakti swayan ko aadhyatmik kahata he vah angrejon se khulkar baat karne main darataa kyon he? unhone hindustan ke sabhi naujavaanon ko aise chhadmaveshi mahatma ke bahekaave main na aane kii salaah dete hue unki krantikari party main shaamil ho kar angrejon se takkar lene kaa khulaa aavahan kiya tha
 In this revolutionary published in English as The Revolutionary, the ideological thinking of revolutionaries * can be understood well
 is patr kaa avikal hindi kavyanuwaad ab hindi vicistrot par bhi uplabdh he
 Seeing this 4-page manifesto published as The Revolutionary, the British government started searching for its author in Bengal
 sanyog se shacheendra nath sanyaal bankura main us samay giraftaar kar liye gayi jab ve yah ghoshnaptr apane kisi saathi ko post karne ja rahe the
 Similarly, as soon as Yogesh Chandra Chatterjee got a party meeting from Kanpur, he got off the train at Howrah station that he was caught with a lot of copies of the HRA Constitution
 unhen hazaribagh jail main band kar diya gaya
 After the arrest of both the prominent leaders, the responsibility of Uttar Pradesh as well as the revolutionary members of Bengal came on the shoulders of Ram Prasad Bismil
 bismil kaa swabhaav tha ki ve yaa to kisi kaam ko haath main lete na the or yadi ek baar kaam haath main le liya to use puraa kiye bagaiyr chhodte na the
 There was a need for money for the work of the party earlier, but now it has increased even more
 kahin se bhi dhan praapt hota na dekh unhone 7 march 1925 ko bichpuri tathaa 24 may 1925 ko dwarkapur main do raajnneetik dakaitiyaan daaleen
 But he could not get any special money in them
 in donon dakaitiyon main ek-ek vyakti maukey par hi maaraa gaya
 Due to this, Bismil's soul suffered immensely
 antatah unhone yah pakkaa nishchay kar liya ki ve ab keval sarkari khajaana hi lootenge, hindustan ke kisi bhi rais ke ghar dakaiti bilkul na daalenge
 a decision was made at an emergency meeting held on 7 August 1925 at his house in Shahjahanpur and on 9 August 1925, a total of 10 people led by Bismil from Shahjahanpur railway station, including Ashfaq Ulla Khan, Rajendra Lahiri, Chandrashekhar Azad, Shacheendranath Bakshi, Manmathanath Gupt, Mukundi Lal, Keshav Chakraborty, Murari Sharma and Banwari Lal, boarded the 8 Down saharanpur-lucknow passenger train

 The range of these mausers was also higher than that of ordinary pistols
 un dinon ye moujar aaj kii e ke - 47 raifal kii tarah charchit the
 Stopping at Kakori railway station before Lucknow, as soon as the train moved forward, the revolutionaries pulled the chain and stopped it and dropped the box of government treasury from the guard compartment
 use kholane kii koshish kii gayi kintu jab vah nahin khulaa to ashfak ulla khan ne apana moujar manmathanath gupt ko pakadaa diya or hathaudaa lekar baksaa todane main jute gayi
 Manmathnath Gupta eagerly pressed the trigger of the Maujar, causing the missed bullet to the passenger named Ahmed Ali
 vah maukey par hi dher ho gaya
 In a hurry, a sheet of leather filled with silver coins and notes was tied in sheets and a sheet was left there to escape from there
 agle din akhabaaron ke madhyam se yah khabar puure sansar main fail gayi
 The British government took this train robbery seriously and handed over the task of investigating the fastest police in Scotland, under the leadership of Mr
 RA Harton, an assistant to the D

G
 si ai di ne gambheer chaanbin karke sarkaar ko is baat kii pushti kar di ki kakori train dakaiti krantikariyon kaa ek suniyojit shadyantr he
 The police put up advertisements in all the prominent places to give information in connection with the Kakori case and announce the reward for arresting any person involved in the conspiracy
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki police ko ghatnasthal par mili chadar main lage dhobi ke nishaan se is baat kaa pataa chal gaya ki chadar shahjahanpur ke hi kisi vyakti kii he
 On inquiring from the dhobis of Shahjahanpur it was found that the chadar was of Banarasi Lal
 banarsi laal se milakar police ne sara bhed praapt kar liya
 It was also known that on 9 August 1925, who were his partymen from Shahjahanpur went out of the city and when did they return? When intelligence was confirmed that Ram Prasad Bismil, the leader of HR was not in the city that day, then on the night of 26 September 1925, Bismil was accompanied by more than 40 people from all over India
 Was arrested
 kakori kand main keval 10 hi log vaastavik rup se shaamil hue the at: un sabhi ko namjad kiya gaya
 Except five of them - Chandrashekhar Azad, Murari Sharma, Keshav Chakraborty, Ashfaq Ulla Khan and Shachindra Nath Bakshi, who did not come into the hands of the police, the remaining people were prosecuted and sentenced to 5 years of imprisonment

 The police broke Banarasi Lal in the lockup, fearing severe punishment
 shahjahanpur jila congress cameti main party-fund ko lekar isi banarsi kaa bismil se jhagada ho chukaa tha
 Bismil, who was then the Auditor of the District Congress Committee, suspended Banarasi from the primary membership of the Congress party, proving allegations of embezzlement in the party fund
 baad main jab gandhi ji 16 oktober 1920 ko shahjahanpur aaye to banarsi ne unase milakar apana paksh rakkha
 At that time, Gandhiji made a reconciliation between the two, saying that they should not give so much money to the small hera-hai
 parantu banarsi bada hi dhoort aadmi tha
 He first apologized to Bismil and then took Gandhiji aside and filled his ears that Ramprasad is a very criminal type
 ve isaki kisi baat kaa na to swayan vishwaas karen na hi kisi or ko karne den
 Later, this Banarasi Lal befriended Bismil and gained his trust before sweet talks and then became a partner in the cloth business with him
 jab bismil ne gandhi ji kii aalochana karte hue apni alag party bana lee to banarsi laal atyadhik prasann hua or maukey kii talash main chup saadhe baitha rahaa
 The police, knowing the difference between Bismil and Banarasi's previous quarrel with the local people, made Banarasi Lal an approver and used it as an infallible tool in the entire prosecution against Bismil
 banarsi laal vyapaar main saajheedaar hone ke kaaran party sambandhi aisi-aisi gopneey baaten jaanata tha, jinhen bismil ke atirikt or koi bhi na jaan saktaa tha

 After reading it, the judges expressed doubt that Bismil had written this debate by some jurist instead of writing it himself
