 party pramukh uddhav thakare ne ab mob linching or goraksha jaise muddon par bhi bijepi ko nishane par liya he
 Has also raised questions about Hindutva
 shivasena mukhpatr saamana main chape intervyuu main uddhav ne bataaya ki balasahab thakare jis hindutv kii baat karte the wo shivaji maharaj kaa hindutv tha lekin pichley 3 saal se desh main jo hindutv kaa unmaad chadha he, wo sahi nahin he
 Apart from this, he also blamed mob lynching in the name of Hindutva and Gayak
 thakare ne kaha ki, 'gaay kii raksha ho rahi he, lekin mahilaon ke bare main desh sabase asurakshit banataa ja rahaa he
 Shame on him
 gomata kii raksha to karo lekin mata kii raksha kaa kya?'uddhav thakare ne aarope lagaaya ki mahilaon kii raksha chhodkar koun kya maance kha rahaa he, isaki jaanch karne main sarkaar lagi hui he
 He clearly said that it cannot be called Hindutva, it is spreading confusion
 avishvaas prastaav par voting se duuri banaae rakhane ke shivasena ke faisle se amit shah naaraaz bataae ja rahe hai
 Amit Shah called Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray a day before the no-confidence motion
 uske baad sambhaavna jataai ja rahi thi ki shivasena sarkaar ko samarthan degi
 Angered by the Shiv Sena's behavior during the no-confidence motion, Amit Shah told the Maharashtra BJP leaders in Mumbai that the way the Shiv Sena has behaved for some time, especially the absence of a no-confidence motion, then we may have to go alone in Maharashtra
 isliye hamen sabhi 48 loksabhaa siton par taiyaar rahanaa chahie

 An unknown fear, an unknown fear, occurs only until it passes
 shaayad isiilie ham main se kisi ne kabhi laash ko darate hue nahin dekha
 For the last 40 hours, the fear that kept us arrested, the truth with which we did not want to lose sight, the truth has come out
 wo khoff khatm ho gaya
 Now the feeling of being lost is less left, what would not have happened would have been a sorrow
 wo jeena chaahati thi
 When he objected to an unknown boy expecting marriage
 wo tab bhi jeena chaahati thi
 When that unknown boy, playing with his feelings, served him in front of his own friends
 wo tab bhi jeena chaahati thi
 Found in love when she was going to court in an attempt to save the love of slipping from the hand of a closed sand in a hoax
 wo tab bhi jeena chaahati thi
 When surrounded by him in the dark, the boy, who was once in love with him, attacked him with knives with some knives
 wo tab bhi jeena chaahati thi
 Jalaamagar, alive by putting petrol, also came at a time when the situation not only out of its extent but also got out of the above

 She wanted to live even when she was burning
 or to or wo tab bhi jeena chaahati thi
 90 per cent of the victim was burnt when she was burnt and she said this to her heart while taking her last breath in Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital
 magar darindon ne use is haal main bhi nahin choda tha ki gharavaale is najuk maukey par uskaa haath bhi tham pate
 Because she was completely scorched from head to toe, ie ninety percent
 or is haalat main doctoron ne gharavaalon ko uske zyaada kareeb jane se bhi roak diya tha
 Forever silenced 'he' wanted to finally get the gang rape victim of Unnao late on Friday night 11
 40 par dilli ke safadarajang aspataal se is duniya ko chhodana padaa
 One last attempt to save the victim girl occurred after she was airlifted from Lucknow to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi
 lekin tab tak kaaphi der ho chuki thi
 And within two days he died
 'aropiyon ko chhodana mat'isamen koi shaq nahin wo bahut bahadur thi
 Had it not been so, she would not have fought alone for justice, even after a crime like crushing gang rape
 naa akele court jaati or naa hi tab wo khud ko bachaane kii koshish karti jab use darinde jala rahe the
 Just remember that she ran for one kilometer even after burning completely from head to toe
 ilaaj ke dauraan bhi wo baar-baar kahati rahi ki mere aropiyon ko chhodana mat lekin ye kehete kehete uski aawaaj hameshaa ke liye khamosh ho gai
 05 December 2019, Thursday, 4 am Rape victim was going to Baiswara Bihar railway station of Unnao to catch a train to go to Rae Bareli
 use raibareli main apane vakil se cese ke silsile main kuch baat kerani thi
 But during this time, on the Gaura turn, the accused named Harishankar Trivedi, Kishore, Shubham, Shivam and Umesh of the village surrounded him and attacked him with a stick on the head and a knife on the neck
 chakkar aane se peedita gir gai to aropiyon ne usapar petrol daalana shuru kar diya or aag laga di
 His body was burning with smoke
 wo jalte hue sadak par daudti rahiaag kaa gola bani ladki ko jisane bhi dekha uskaa kalejaa kaanp gaya
 She was constantly asking for help
 maukey par maujuud chashmadidon ne police ko kol kii
 Moreover, in the same burning condition, the victim herself spoke to the police and called for help
 thodi hi der main police maukey par pahunchi auki use aspataal le gai
 But first brought to Delhi via air ambulance from the nearest hospital and then from Lucknow
 magar itani koshish ke baavjood vahi hua jise har koi taalna chahta tha
 He showed courage even in the face of death, even in the last time he took a promise from his family members
 mujhe insaaf zarur dilaanaa
 Must have hanged my criminals
 zindagi kaa mazaaq dekhie
 She was running towards death
 lekin khud maut ke shikanje main jakadin hone ke baavjood wo himmat nahin haarana chaahati thi
 She used to say only one thing when she came to her senses in Safdarjung Hospital
 main jeena chaahati hum
 But regret
 do dinon kaa gam khatm ho gaya
 The swinging moments between life and death ceased
 kya karen
 The incineration that was done before the pyre was consumed
 lekin sawaal ab bhi sulag rahe hai
 This was how the story of Darjeeling started at 11:40 pm on December 6 night, this dreadful story of Darjeeling started about a year and a half ago
 jab unnav ke sivam ne peedit ladki ko apni gandi or khaufnak sajishon kaa nishaanaa banaaya
 Actually, the victim girl was in dispute with marriage to Shivam, the main accused in the case
 ilzaam he ki sivam ne shaadi kaa jhansa dekar peedit kaa yon shoshan kiya or vaade se mukar gaya
 When the victim applied pressure, the accused Shivam also got the marriage documents prepared from the court
 lekin iske baavjood wo peedit ko dhokhaa dekar phir se gaayab ho gaya
 December 12, 2018, when the victim's girl again pressurized the accused, he came out with threats and blackmailing
 lekin peedit ke baar baar kehane par usne ek baar phir use baatcheet ke liye bulaayaa
 But the conversation was just an excuse
 peedit jab sivam kii bataai gai jagah par pahunchi to vahaan sivam ke saath uskaa saathi shubham bhi tha
 Both made the victim a victim of his humanity
 gangrape kaa shikaar hui peedit ladki jab police ke paas shikaayat darj karwaane pahunchi to aropiyon kaa rasookh aropiyon se bhi bada dushman ban kar khadaa
 The victim lost the round, but the police did not register an FIR
 4 janvari 2019raibareli court main cese darj hone ke baad sivam kii giraftaar to ho gai lekin uske parivaar kii taraf se peedit or uske gharavaalon ko cese waapas lene ke liye lagaataar dhamkiyaan milane lagi
 Many times the father was also assaulted
 3 disambar 2019peedit ke pita ko andaja bhi nahin rahaa hoga ki use di ja rahi dhamkiyaan hakeekat ke kitne najadik hai
 As soon as he was released from jail on 1 December, accused Shivam, along with his friends, hatched another creepy conspiracy
 5 disambar 2019jail se reeha hone ke chauthe din hi sivam ne aapni sajeesh ko anjaam de diya
 The victim was set to visit Rae Bareli to meet her lawyer
 lekin stesan jane ke raste main hi aropiyon ne use gherkar hamalaa kar diya or jab wo gash khaakar zamin par gir padi to aropiyon ne use aag ke hawaale kar diya
 All the five accused were caught by the police within hours of the incident
 peedit ko ilaaj ke liye lakhanu pahunchaaya gaya
 Airlift Kara was brought to Delhi the same night due to the condition being very critical
 lekin safadarajang aspataal main bhartee hone ke kareeb 24 ghante baad hi usne dam tod diya

 com / ukkev6kgpq Nanjundaswamy, who works for Flipkart, arrived at a gym in Bengaluru on December 9 to deliver a smartphone, but the person, the gym trainer who ordered the phone, was waiting for him with a knife
 kuch din baad 29-varshiya nanjundaswami kii laash baraamad hui, jiskaa galaa reta diya gaya tha
 In fact, 22-year-old gym trainer Varun Kumar did not have enough money to buy a smartphone, so he planned to get the phone at any cost, even if he had to kill the person who came to deliver it
 
 haal hi main gym main naukari shuru karne ke baad varun ne paaya ki uske adhiktar sahakarmiyon ke paas smartphone hai, so, usne bhi apane pita se aisa hi phone dilaane kaa anurodh kiya, lekin usase kah diya gaya ki smartphone use khud paise kamakar khareednaa hoga
 After this, Varun went online and ordered a smartphone, and gave Jim's address as his address
 police kaa kahana he ki varun ne smartphone deliver karne pahunche nanjundaswami par lohe kii chad or phooldaan se hamalaa kiya
 When Nanjundaswamy fainted, Varun allegedly sanded his throat, and then dragged his body to the basement
 varun ne lagbhag 12,000 rupee keemat vaala smartphone to kathith rup se apane paas rakh hi liya, usne nanjundaswami ke bag main maujuud anya phone bhi chura liye
 When Nanjundaswamy did not return home for two days, his family lodged a missing report
 jab police uski aakhri jelivery kii jagah talashti hui gym kii imaarat tak pahunchi, unhen nanjundaswami kaa shav tahkhaane main mil gaya
 Soon the episodes reached Varun, who had kept the gym closed since the murder
 use isi hafte giraftaar kiya gaya he
 The comments police kaa maananaa he ki varun ne katl kii saazish pehle se rach rakhi thi, kyonki usne phone kii delivery se ek din pehle hi rasoi main istemaal hone vaala chaaku laakar gym main rakh liya tha
 Now it is being tried to find out if Varun had taken help from anyone in this crime
 flipcart ke pravaktaa ke mutabik nanjundaswami ek agency main naukari karata tha, jo online shopping company flipcart ke liye delivery kaa kaam karti thi
 The spokesman also said that financial support will be provided to Nanjundaswamy's family
 darasal, 22-varshiya gym trainer varun kumaar ke paas itane paise nahin the ki vah smartphone kharid saktaa, to usne kisi bhi keemat par phone hasil karne kii saazish rachi, bhale hi uske liye use delivery karne aae shaks kaa katl hi kyon na karnaa pade
 Recently, after starting a job in the gym, Varun found that most of his co-workers had smartphones, so he requested his father to get a similar phone, but he was told that he would have to buy it by earning money himself
 
 iske baad varun ne onlil jaakar smartphone kaa order kar diya, or apane pate ke taur par gym kaa pataa de diya
 Police say that Varun attacked Nanjundaswamy with an iron rod and a vase when he arrived to deliver the smartphone
 jab nanjundaswami behosh ho gaya, varun ne kathith rup se uskaa galaa ret daalaa, or phir uske shav ko ghasitkar tahkhaane main le gaya
 Varun allegedly kept a smartphone valued at around Rs 12,000, and also stole other phones in Nanjundaswamy's bag
 jab do din tak nanjundaswami ghar nahin lautaa, to uske parivaar ne gumshudagi kii report darj karwaai
 When police arrive at the gym building, looking for his last place of delivery, they find Nanjundaswamy's body in the basement
 jald hi kadiyaan varun tak pahunch gayi, jisane katl ke baad se gym ko band hi kar rakhaa tha
 He was arrested this week
 tippaniyan Police believe that Varun had already hatched the murder plot because he had brought the knife used in the kitchen to the gym a day before the delivery of the phone
 ab is baat kaa pataa lagane kii koshish kii ja rahi he ki kya is aparaadh main varun ne kisi kii madad lee thi
 According to a Flipkart spokesperson, Nanjundaswamy used to work in an agency that used to do the delivery work for online shopping company Flipkart
 pravaktaa ne yah bhi kaha ki nanjundaswami ke parivaar ko aarthik sahaayta di jaaegi

 In a detonating fuse company near Raipur, the capital of Chhattisgarh, five workers were killed in a blast in the early hours of Friday
 yah haadasa navabharat fus company main hua, jo raipur se kareeb 40 kilometre dur abhanpur block ke chote urla gaanv main sthit he
 The explosion occurred in explosives placed in a room between 2:30 and 3 am in the wee hours of police officers
 kamare main ek suparvizer samet saat karmchaaree maujuud the, lekin visphot hone se kuch minute pehle suparvizer or ek majdoor vahaan se baahar nikal gaye the
 The remaining five workers in the room died in the blast
 lekin sapa ke pradesh pravaktaa rajendra choudhary kehete hai, "hamaari party ne varanasi se bahut majboot pratyaashee utaara he
 She is contesting with full force
 vah kadi takkar bhi de rahi hai
 The talk over is completely wrong
 desh ko nayaa pradhanmantri milane ja rahaa he
 "whatever the two parties say now, but it is clear that this time the election of Varanasi has been out of the discussion
 2014 main modi ke khilaaf aam aadmi party (aap) ke ummidavaar arvind kejariwal chunaav haar jarur gaye the, lekin unhone kadi chunauti pesh kii thi
 Due to Kejriwal, the eyes of the country and the world were on the Varanasi seat in 2014
 haalanki kejariwal ko do lakh se kuch adhik voton se hi santosh karnaa padaa tha, or narendra modi 5 lakh 81 hajaar vot paakar vijayi hue the
 Ajay Rai of Congress got around 76 thousand votes
 sapa ke kailash chaurasia ko 45,291 or basapa ke vijay prakaash jaiswal ko 60,579 vot hasil hue the
 Narendra Modi went to Varanasi in 2014 as a strategy, and he was successful in his cause
 is baar bhi unka makasad purana hi he
 It was believed that the opposition would field a common and strong candidate to surround Modi
 varanasi se vipakshi ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa main deree se bhi is sambhaavna ko bal mila tha
 There was a discussion about Priyanka's candidature
 logon main utsukata badi thi
 But with the announcement of candidature of Shalini Yadav and then Ajay Rai, the eagerness of the people of Varanasi seat was reduced
 varisht raajnneetik vishleshak ratanmani laal kehete hai, "banaras, lakhanu sahit kuch aisi siten thim, jahaan congress or sapa-basapa kii taraf se majboot cheharaa utaarne kii ranneeti bani thi
 But this could not happen due to mutual differences
 jis din grahamantri rajnath singh ne lakhanu se parchaa bharaa, usee din sapa-basapa or congress ne apane-apane pratyaashee ghoshit kar die
 The same situation was also seen in Benaras
 vipaksh ekajute hokar banaras main majboot pratyaashee utaarata to iskaa bada sandesh jaataa
 "he said," Arvind Kejriwal came to fight against Modi in 2014
 vah bhale hi chunaav haar gaye, lekin kejariwal ke kaaran varanasi kaa chunaav duniya bhar main charchaa kaa vishay rahaa tha
 "according to another political analyst Prem Shankar Mishra," the SP-BSP coalition lacked a strong face
 varsh 2009 ke chunaav main murali manohar joshi ke khilaaf mukhtaar ansaari ne kadi takkar jarur di thi, lekin is baar gathbandhan shaayad aisa jokhim nahin lenaa chahta tha, jisase dhuvrikaran hota
 There was talk of Priyanka contesting from the Congress, but the Congress did not want to spoil her trump card
 agar priyanka chunaav haratin to gandhi parivaar kii raajnneeti khatm ho jaati
 "he said," Yes, if the Congress had given a strong candidate in Varanasi other than Ajay Rai, the fight would have been interesting, and would have had an impact on the surrounding seats as well
 lekin aisa nahin ho sakaa
 "varanasi will be voting on May 19 under the final phase, and counting will take place on May 23

 India batted first in this Test and scored 246 runs
