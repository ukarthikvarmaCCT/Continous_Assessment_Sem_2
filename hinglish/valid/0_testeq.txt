 In this way, rodents are divided into three subgroups: 1
 syuromorpha arthath gilahari sadrush kritak, 2
 Myomorpha, ie rodents like rodents and 3

 Portuguese traveler Vasco da Gama benefited from the journey that the people of the Western countries, primarily in immediate transit to the Portuguese, to the eastern countries Route detected
 isliye unka prasthaan tathaa vistaar ab anya deshon main bhi hone laga
 He reached China at the time of taking over Malacca in the early 16th century
 china main unki pahunch 1514 i

 As soon as he came to China, he became involved in business
 yahan ke vyapaaree china se vilasapriy chizon ko kharidne lage or pashchimi deshon main unka vikray kiya jane laga jahaan prasadhano kii maang thi
 But the Portuguese could not please the Chinese by their behavior
 inke vyavhaar tathaa aadaten acchhee nahin thi keval portguese hi bure nahin the, anya jatiyon kii bhi aisi hi aadaten thim
 When the people of Spain reached America, the life of the original castes there also became very annoying due to them
 spain ke logon ke virodh kiye jane par bhi america nahin choda or vahaan bastiyon kaa nirmaan kar niyamit rup se bas gayi
 As soon as they settled regularly, they began to interfere in the religion, culture, living, etc
 of the American people
 itnaa hi nahin, bastiyon ke nirmaan ke saath-saath shanahshanaih ve upnivesh nirmaan kii ore bhi unmukh hue isi silsile main spainvasi china bhi pahunche
 The Spanish came to China after the Portuguese
 america main is jati ne jis prakaar kii harakat kii thi, usase china ke log parichit hi the
 Therefore, as soon as the arrival of this caste took the seeds of colonization on Chinese soil, the Chinese started opposing them
 ming sarkaar ne to is jati ke viruddh ek joardaar aandolan bhi prarambh kar diya
 This is the reason why the Spaniards could not melt in China like America
 ve china main na to apana astitv hi kaayam kar sake or na aakankshit bastiyon kaa hi nirmaan kar sake
 Commercial relations with the Portuguese were also established
 inase yah sambandh bhi kaayam nahin ho sakaa
 Nevertheless, the Spanish were stubborn
 america main jis prakaar ve balpurvak rahane lage the usee prakaar ve china main bhi rahane kaa prayaas kiye
 a group of them stayed in the famous port canton of China and tried to establish a commercial relationship with China
 ant main, atharahavin sadi ke uttararddh main apane kaary main unhen safalataa mili or makaao main apni basti kaa nirmaan kar ve rahane lage
 At the same time, many religious missionaries from the west also came to China
 china main in mishnariyon ne dharm kaa prachaar karnaa prarambh kiya
 Initially the behavior of these missionaries was good, but later the Chinese people became aware of their selfish policy
 isi samay angrejon tathaa dachon kaa bhi aagaman china main hua
 But it should be remembered here that under the rule of the Ming dynasty, China had two kinds of relations with the Western countries - a trade relationship and a religious relationship
 pashchim ke desh dakshin ke bhukhndon kaa makaao tathaa canton se vyapaar karte the
 Traders from the west brought many grain-related plants and tobacco to their countries in China
 tambaaku kaa prachaar in logon ne kaaphi kiya
 Because of this, most of the people of China started consuming tobacco
 isi prakaar china se unka dharmik sambandh bhi kaayam tha
 Missionaries from western countries used to preach in the interior of China
 mongolon ke shashan ke baad china main isaayiyon kaa ant ho chalaa tha or unka prabhaav ghatane laga tha
 But in the last years of Ming Dynasty, Roman Catholics revived these Christians and their missionaries
 isi samay britain, france vagairah se franciscan, agstinian, juseit, dominian aadi anek dharmik sampradaay ke log china pahunch gayi
 It was only in the early years of the sixteenth century that the predominance of the Jesuit cult began to prevail in China
 is sampradaay kaa lokapriy prachaar francis jevirs tha jisase dakshini tathaa purvi asia main is sampradaay ko lokapriy banane kaa athak or athak prayaas kiya
 Not only this preacher propagated this community in China
 vastutah jevirs ke chalate hi china main yah sampradaay jivit ho sakaa
 At present, Javisarya had not even got complete success in his work that in 1556 AD he passed away from the world
 uski mrityu ke pashchaat uske kaary kaa bhaar mathhar ricki ne apane kandhon par liya
 Rikki was a resident of Italy

 He was a scholar of astrology and mathematics

 Due to his talent, he also studied China literature

 He had to study his religion, he studied Confucius's religion and Christianity deeply and tried to keep the equality and inequality of both religions as a scholar
 china kii rajdhani peking main usne apana nivas sthal banaaya
 At the same time, the Spaniard also came to China from the Philippine
 abtak china main anek pashchimi jatiyaan aa gayi thim
 The Portuguese arrived in 1516 AD, the Spanish arrived in 1575 AD; The Dutch arrived in 1604 AD and the British arrived in 1637 AD
 par is samay tak amareeki tathaa roosi nahin aa paye the
 His arrival also occurred in China during the Ching reign
 1644 i
 main ming vansh kaa shashan samaapt ho gaya
 In the north, the conquerors named Manchu defeated Ming
 manchu manchuriya ke rahanevaale the
 In the latter half of the Sohalteenth and early Seventeenth centuries, they strengthened themselves and hijacked Mukden from Ming, which was also their capital
 mukden ko ve bhi apni rajdhani banaae
 The Mongols living in China also willingly or unwillingly accepted the rule of the Manchus
 manchuon ne china kii dakshini diwaar tak apni rajya-seemaa badhaane kaa prayaas kiya
 At the same time, when a feeling of dissatisfaction against the Ming was born in China, Manchuo took the opportunity to take control of Peking, and since then he started ruling in China
 konghsi or china lung is vansh ke sarvaadhik pratapi raja hue
 For a long time Manchuo ruled China
 manchookaal main bhi pashchimi logon kaa aagaman china main hua
 If truth be told, it is to be believed that it was during this period that the influence of Western countries in China started to build up and it was during this period that China's real relationship with foreign countries was established
 is kaal main videshon se log sthal tathaa donon margon se aaye
 Portugese, Spanish, French and English and some Italian and German came by sea
 isi samay 1784 i

 Only Russians came by land route who started trading in silver in China
 videshi rajyon se china main is samay ek sandhi bhi kii
 By this treaty Russia got the right to send a mission to Peking
 peking main rus kii mishanri bhi kaary karne lagi
 This relationship with America and Russia proved to be important for China
 china main is samay punah videshi mishnariyon kaa bhi aagaman hua
 Foreign missionaries also arrived at this time in eighteenth-century China
 atharahavin sadi ke prarambh tak china main isaayiyon kii sankhya 3,00,000 ho gayi thi
 In 1793, a British mission first came to China
 yah mishan mecortne ke netritv main china aayaa tha
 The second mission came to Peking in 1816 AD
 iskaa netritvkarta lard amherst tha
 At the same time, a mission under Robert Morishan also reached China
 is maukey se laabh uthaakar ab protestand mishnariyon ne china main apana kaary prarambh kiya
 Protestants looked down upon the Chinese and considered them rude
 angrejon kii dekha-dekhi dach mishnariyaan bhi china aayin or 1795 i
 main unka pehla mishan china pahunchaa
 Similarly, a messenger from Russia arrived in 1806 AD
 lekin china ne uske prati kisi bhi prakaar kii sahanubhuti kaa pradarshan nahin kiya
 Peking also reached the Gemuite of France and sang the glory of the Manchu emperor
 vibhinn mishnariyon main sarvaadhik chatur tathaa prabhaavshaalini angrejon kii mishnariyaan sabit huin
 If we compare the English missionaries with the various missionaries who came to China, then it becomes clear that in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the English missionary surpassed all
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki angrej atyant chatur tathaa karmath the
 Due to his business acumen and political prowess, he did not allow other missionaries to advance in the competition and in future he was able to establish his influence in China
 uparyukt vivaran se spasht ho jaataa he ki china tathaa paashchaatya deshon ke bich sambandh kaayam ho chalaa tha or unnisvin sadi tak sampoorn china anek videshi tathaa unki mishnariyaan drushtigochar hone lagi thim
 But that relationship could not proceed peacefully
 china kii janata sarkaar in videshiyon tathaa unki mishnariyon se dhire-dhire ghrinaa karne lagi
 His idea was that China's civilization and culture could be destroyed by increasing contact with Western countries, so China experienced western trends and tried to stay away from them
 paashchaatya deshon ke sampark main aakar bhi usne apni vesh-bhusha, dharm or reeti-rivaajon ko angikaar kiya
 This was the reason that the Manchu government began to try to remain separate from these western countries openly, keeping in mind that Emperor Kanghasi took out a state communiqué and tried to deprive these castes and missionaries from entering China
 is vijyapti ke peeche samrat kii apni bhaavana to thi hi, saath-hi-saath china kii janata ko bhi santusht karne ke liye use yah vijyapti nikaalani padi
 People of China started hating these foreigners and it was expected that there could be bloodshed in China
 visheshkar videshi mishnariyon se china main kaaphi asantosh tha
 "the feuds between the various missionary orders, the recognition of the emperor's order by some religion-minded people respecting the ancestors, as well as the lack of authority by their officers' representation towards the trend of the new religion, gradually led to misleading ideas
 Opened her eyes to the real character of the preacher
 lekin yah yaad rakhni chahie ki is vijyapti ke anusaar china main aae hue videshiyon ko china se baahar nahin nikaala gaya
 It was said that only a kind of control was placed on them or traders coming from different countries
 china kii manchu sarkaar ko yah ashanka ho gayi thi ki agar in vyapaariyon ko vyapaar karne kii anumati nahin di jaaegi to ve sampoorn china main falkar ashaanti failaane kaa praytn karenge
 Therefore, it was made clear in this release that these foreign traders can trade peacefully from all the coastal ports of China
 vyapaar karne kii anumati milte hi videshiyon kii prasannataa kaa parawar nahin rahaa kyonki bade sahaj dhang se hi unhen yah anumati mil gayi thi
 This encouraged both their enthusiasm and encouragement
 faltah arth-lolupata ke chalate in logon ne nazaij vyapaar bhi karnaa prarambh kiya
 They also began to misuse the trading facilities they had received
 swaabhaavik rup se china kii sarkaar kaa dhyaan punah unki ore aakarshith hua
 That is why the second emperor of Manchu dynasty, Chien Luge, issued a second communique in 1757 AD, due to which foreign trade was limited in China and many kinds of restrictions were imposed on the traders
 is vijyapti ke anusaar in videshi vyapaariyon ko dakshini china ke keval ek bandargah canton se vyapaar karne kii anumati mili
 In addition, a trading party was organized in China called 'co-hung'
 is dal ke paraamarsh tathaa dekh-rekh main hi videshi vyapaaree china se vyapaar kar sakate the
 Thus in the second half of the eighteenth century, the Chinese government kept a sharp eye on the moves of those merchants and made it clear that they could not visit any other port for business matters
 par is vijyapti kaa koi vishesh asar videshi vyapaariyon par nahin padaa
 Along with trade, they began to interfere in the politics of China, and the Christian missionaries began to get worse
 canton se vyapaar karte-karte ve china ke anya bandargahon se bhi vyapaar karne lage
 The Chinese started making their habits bad by consuming opium
 opium khaane kii aadat pad jane se vyapaaree opium kii bikri dwaara aarthik laabh praapt karnaa chaahate the
 When the Chinese government began to see the bad consequences of opium and stopped this trade, then foreign traders started bribing the Chinese officers to join them and this trade continued in secret
 is kaary main england ke angrej atyant patu the
 Due to opium, China began to suffer two types of losses
 ek to opium kii bikri bad jane se angrejon ko phayda hua, lekin china ko aarthik kshati uthaani padi
 Second is that the moral level of the people of China started falling down
 faltah sarkaar ne purna kathorta ke saath opium ke vyapaar par niyantran rakhane kaa prayaas kiya jiske falswaroop china tathaa britain main opium yuddh hua
 China could not succeed in this war because its enemies had a powerful and central government and China's rule was weak and decentralized
 atah in shatruon kaa saamana karne ke liye china shashan kamjor tathaa vikendrit tha
 Therefore China was not ready to face these enemies at all
 ’’ In this way, after many years until the nineteenth century, the relationship of foreigners with China was established
 is sambandh ke parinaam chiniyon ke liye nitant bure hi siddh hue
 It is true that due to these foreigners, the feeling of nationalism came in China, but as long as the pulse of foreigners was wrong, they continued to counter the development of their imperialism in China
 bhartiya itihaaskaar shri pannikar kaa mat he ki paashchaatya deshon ke sampark se china ko laabh se adhik kshati uthaani padi or pratham vishwa-yuddh ke paanch-chah varshon ke pashchaat tak china kaa gaurav dhul-dhoosarit hota rahaa, raajnneetik akhandta tuutati rahi or prashasnic dridhtaa laayi nahin ja saki
 China gained dominance over Central Asia as it overtook the Central Asian countries in martial arts, but at the same time began to weaken before European powers
