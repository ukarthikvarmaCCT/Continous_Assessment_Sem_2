 Aditya Kashyap, who is the son of a famous industrialist, is deeply distressed, becoming more unhappy by attending the wedding of a girl who falls in love with someone else
 use duniya se nazaren milaane main shame mahasoos hoti he, vah shaadi ke samaaroh ko chhod kar chalaa jaataa he or raat ko ek train pakadta he
 On the train, he meets a beautiful, talkative girl Geet Dhillon, who is going to his home in Bhatinda from Mumbai
 shuru main, aditya geet se bahut chidh jaataa he or har baar usase milanaa uske liye kisi maansik yantranaa se kam nahin hota he
 She tells him about her plans to elope with her lover Anshuman, as well as that her parents will not agree to her marriage
 geet aditya ko itnaa pareshaan kar detii he ki vah train se utar jaataa he
 Geet tries to call her back on the train, in the same mishap, her train leaves and the two stand at a desolate station, Geet's luggage is left in the train and she has no money
 geet aditya ko bataati he ki ab use hi surakshit rup se uske ghar punjab tak pahunchaana hoga
 The two embark on a joyous journey through the North Indian territories, reaching the house of song with buses, taxis and camels
 aditya jo geet ke saath bahut sa samay bitaa chukaa hota he, vah jivan ko lekar phir se sakaaratmak mahasoos karne lagata he
 When they arrive home, Geet's housemates get mistaken that they both love each other, but they both quickly convince Geetha's family that there is nothing between them
 aditya geet ke parivaar ko bataata he ki vah ek sangeetkaar he, vah nahin chahta ki ve log use ek prasiddh udyogpati ke rup main pahchaan len or uskaa parivaar is baat ko sweekaar kar letaa he
 a few days later, Geet's family sees a boy for her, who is about to come see him to marry her
 jab vah ladkaa vahaan aata he, geet aditya ke saath pyaar kaa naatak karti he, vah geet or aditya ko ek saath kuch antarang kshan bitaate hue dekh letaa he
 Later that night, Geet runs away from home with Aditya to marry Anshuman in Manali
 baharhaal, geet kii bahan un donon ko ek saath bhaagate hue dekh leti he or puure parivaar ko is bare main bataa detii he
 They quickly try to catch them, but this justifies their suspicion that they both love each other
 ve donon manali pahunch jate hai or phir apane alag alag raste pakadte hai
 Due to the impact of the song, with a new faith and a positive attitude towards life, Aditya reaches Mumbai and leads his company to peak success
 uske pahunchane ke lagbhag nau maheene ke baad, vah ek nayaa utpaada launch karata he, "geet" ke naam par ek colling card
 Geet's family watches the launch on TV and leaves for Mumbai to meet Aditya
 aditya yah sunakar hairaan ho jaataa he ki geet ab tak ghar waapas nahin pahunchi he
 He takes the responsibility of finding her and bringing them back home
 aditya phir se manali jaataa he, jahaan use aashaa he ki geet apane nae pati ke saath hogi, lekin yahaan pahunch kar use pataa chalata he ki anshuman ne geet se shaadi karne se inkaar kar diya he or use waapas bhej diya he
 After saying a few spiteful words to Anshuman, Aditya sets out to find the song
 ant main vah use himalay ke ek shahar shimla main dhund letaa he, vah yah dekh kar hairaan ho jaataa he ki geet kya se kya ho gayi he: ek shant, chup, dukhi ladki, jo ek skool main padhaati he
 He prepares her to face these situations, he somehow brings her back to Mumbai and things start to happen in her favor
 haalanki, anshuman aakar bataata he ki use mahasoos hua ki usne galat kiya he or apane sambandh ko phir se sudhaarney kii koshish karata he
 Initially, Geet does not think she will accept his apology but Aditya asks him to do so, despite that he himself falls in love with her
 teenon bhatinda waapas pahunchate hai, ye bataane ke liye ki geet or anshuman shaadi karnaa chaahate hai
 In Bathinda, the family again feels that Geet and Aditya are in love with each other and in this confusion, they are not able to clear the misconceptions of the family
 is galatfahami ko dur karne kii koshish main, geet ko yah ahsaas hota he ki vah vastav main aditya se hi pyaar karne lagi he, anshuman se nahin or isliye un donon kii shaadi ho jaati he
 He is so busy fighting his insecurities that he does not enjoy his life, then the song comes into his life

 Engineering drawing is a type of technical drawing that is created within technical drawing teaching and is used to fully and clearly define the requirements for engineering objects
 ejineering drawing ko leout, namakaran, vyakhya, swaroop, aakaar, aadi ke liye aam taur par manakikrut niyamon ke anuroop banaaya jaataa he
 One such standardized rule is GD&T
 is tarah ke ek drawing kaa uddeshy, ek utpaada yaa ek ghatak kii sabhi jyamitiya visheshtaon ko sateek rup se or spasht rup se pesh karnaa he
 The ultimate goal of an engineering drawing is to provide all the necessary information that allows a manufacturer to produce that component
 ejineering drawing ko pencil, syaahi, streetes, tii-squaire, french karv, trikon, maapak, scale or rabar jaise upkarnon kaa upyog karte hue haath se banaaya jaataa he
 These days they are usually made electronically by computer aided design
 in drawing ko abhi bhi aksar "bluerekha" yaa "blueprint" ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he, haalanki ye shabd, shabdic pariprekshya se kaaldosh-yukt hai, chunki rasinic-mudran prakriya kaa upyog karke banaai jane vaali ejineering drawing kii adhikansh pratilipi, jo nile rang ke kagaz par yaa vaikalpik rup se safed kagaz par nile rang kii rekhaon main graphics pesh karti thi, use aaj apekshaakrit adhik aadhunik nirmaan prakriyaaon dwaara pratisthapit kar diya gaya he jo safed kaagaj par kaali yaa bahurangi rekhaaen pesh karti he
 The more common term "print" is now in common use in the US, meaning any paper copy of an engineering drawing
 ejineering drawing taiyaar karne kii prakriya or unhen pesh karne ke kaushal ko aksar takneekee drawing yaa drafting ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he, haalanki takneekee drawing kii aavashyaktaa aise vishyon main bhi hoti he jinhen saamaanya rup se abhiyantriki kaa hissaa nahin mana jayega
 Drawings convey the following important information: vibhinn kism kii rekha sheliyaan, bhautik vastuon ko graphic rup se darshaati hai
 Types of lines include the following: rekhaon ko ek akshar vargeekaran dwaara bhi vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he, jisamen prayek rekha ko ek akshar diya jaataa he
 In most cases, a single observation is not sufficient to reflect all the necessary features and multiple observations are used
 avlokan ke prakaar nimnlikhit hai: Spelling projection shows the object from the front, right, left, top, bottom, or back, and is usually positioned relative to each other according to first-angle or third-angle rules of projection

 sabhi avlokanon kaa aavashyak rup se upyog nahin kiya jaataa he or iskaa nirdhaaran ki koun-si sataha agr, prishth, sheersh or nichle kaa gathan karti he, yah prayog kiye gaye prakshepan ke aadhaar par badalata rahata he
 An auxiliary observation is a spelling observation that is projected on any plane other than one of the major six
 in vichaaron kaa aam taur par tab upyog kiya jaataa he jab kisi vastu main kisi prakaar kaa jhukaa hua plane shaamil hota he
 Using assisted observation allows that tilted plane to be presented in its true shape and type
 ek ejineering drawing main kisi bhi visheshta kaa asli aakaar or prakaar, tabhi janaa ja saktaa he jab drushti rekha ), sanderbhit kiye gaye plane se lambavat he
 Symmetric projection represents the object at an angle in which the scales along each axis of the object are equal
 samametiya prakshepan, urdhwadhar aksh ke bare main vastu ke ± 45° degree par ghoomane se mail khaataa he, jiske baad lagbhag ± 35
264° kshaitij aksh ke bare main jo vartanee vishyak prakshepan avlokan se shuru hota he
 The "isometric" of English comes from the "equal measure" of Greek
 ek chiz jo samametiya drawing ko itnaa aakarshak banaati he vah he sahuuliyat, jisase 60 degree ke kone ko sirf compass or streetes se banaaya ja saktaa he
 Symmetric projection is a type of axonometric projection
 anya do prakaar ke exonometric prakshepan hai: a slant projection is a simple type of graphic projection used to create a two-dimensional graphical image of three-dimensional images: tirchhe prakshepan or vartanee vishyak prakshepan, donon main, strot vastu kii samanaantar rekha, prakshepit chhavi main samanaantar rekha kaa nirmaan karti he
 Perspective is a projected display of the image on a flat surface, as it is perceived by the eye
 pariprekshya kii do sabase vishisht visheshta he ki vastuon ko: Schemes are typically "scale diagrams", which means that plans are made at specific proportions relative to the actual size of the place or object
 ek set main vibhinn chitron ke liye vibhinn paimaanon kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, a floor plan can be made at 1:50 while a detailed overview can be made at 1:25
 site yojanaon ko aksar 1:200 yaa 1:100 par banaaya jaataa he
 The required size of attributes is communicated using dimensions
 duuri ko, aayam ke manakikrut do roopon main se kisi ke saath ingit kiya ja saktaa he: raikhik or bhujaman
 The shape of the spherical features is depicted using either diametrical or radius-related dimensions
 trigya aayam, "R" kaa upyog karte hai jiske baad trigya kaa maan aata he; vyas sambandhi aayam ek vrutt kaa istemaal karte hai jisamen se hokar aage kii ore jhuki hui ek vikarn rekha guzarati he, vyas pratik kaha jaataa he, jiske baad vyas kaa maan aata he
 a line connected to a radius with an arrowhead pointing to the spherical feature is called a leader, and is used in combination with both diametrical and radial dimensions
 sabhi prakaar ke aayam, aam taur par do bhaagon se bane hote hai: nammaatr mulya, jo "visheshta" kaa adarsh aakaar he or sahansheeltaa jo maatra ko nirdisht karata he ki mulya nammaatr se neeche yaa upar hokar bhinn ho saktaa he
 The sizes of the images generally follow either of two different standards, ISO or US customary, according to the following tables: metric drawing aakaar, antarrashtriya prishth aakaar ke anuroop hote hai
 These improved further in the second half of the twentieth century, when photocopying became cheaper
 ejineering drawing ko aakaar main sahaj hi duguna kiya ja sakaa or kagaz ke agle bade aakaar par bina sthaan kii barbaadi ke daalaa gaya
 And metric technical pens were chosen in sizes so that a person could add details or format changes to a wide pen that is approximately a multiple of a square of 2

 ATM machines were implemented to make withdrawal of money from banks easy for customers, but these ATM machines also face many problems
 inke kaaran graahakon ko kai baar pareshaani uthaani pad jaati he
 Sometimes fake notes come out from the machine and sometimes without the note, the blank receipt of the withdrawn rupees shows out
 iskaa sambhavit kuch had tak kaaran bainkon main chinis computer takanic kaa prayog mana ja rahaa he
 Apart from this, some recent incidents of theft of ATM machine itself have been heard
 inke kaaran chori yaa lut kaa alarm na bajnaa yaa mashin ke taar kaate jane par switch yani control room ko khabar bhi na lag paanaa aadi hai
 The ATM machine breaks its contact with the switch when it is open for repair
 aise samay bank adhikari yaa atm vainder ke saamne mashin kii aavashyak marammat kii jaati he
 But even in the case of ATM machines' chests or chests being open, these machines remain online giving false message to the switch
 yani aisa sambhav he ki mashin chor le jaaen or switch ko khabar bhi na lage
 Many times fake notes come out of an ATM machine and the bank is not ready to take any responsibility for them
 kai baar jab atm mashin khate se rupee to nikaale dikhaa detii he lekin nakadi mashin se baahar nahin aati yaa kabhi kam hi nikaalati he
 When customers inquire with the bank for such complaints, the banks hand over their call center numbers
 toll free number par chalaae ja rahe is kaal centre kii line milanaa hi pehle to mushkil he or mil bhi jaae to aadhe ghante kii baatcheet ke baavjood graahak ko raahat nahin mil paati

 graahak shikaayat sankhya lekar maansik tanaav grast ho isse kahin behatar he ki bank main jaakar chack se apni raashi nikaale or in jhanjhaton se mukt rahe
 Often it is clearly written on the application of ATM card and Internet banking that the bank will not be responsible for any kind of loss
 hekking or password chori main bankkarmiyon kii sanliptata ke maamle bhi ab khulne lage hai
 Customers cannot cancel their lost ATM card at their bank
 bank daawa karata he ki aap kisi bhi shakha se atm card jari karvaa sakate hai, lekin yahi card kho jaae to pehle bank ke kaal centre main isaki shikaayat darj karaani he
 The bank has to take the complaint number and inform it
 khoe hue atm card se nakadi nikaalane ke alaava khariddaari bhi sambhav he so graahak chahta he ki turant use khoe card se mukti milani chahie
 If the ATM card is used incorrectly, then the customer can also get the police or court office closed

 From this point of view, these machines cannot be considered safe for banking
 galat bhugtan kii pravishtiyon ko thik karne kii vyavastha bhi kargar nahin he
 Sometimes the machine keeps making noise, the money does not run out and the ATM hangs
 kabhi yah raashi kisi duusare graahak ko anayas hi mil jaati he kyonki raashi bich main ataki rahati he or atm achaanak kaam karnaa shuru kar detaa he
 Sometimes the same amount of the customer also gets in the hands of the people of the company feeding cash, paper or ribbon in the ATM

 There are seven Nihnavas mentioned in the ancient Jain sutras, two of which were born during the life of Mahavira itself
 bahurat naam ke pehle nihnav ke sansthaapak kshatriyakund gram ke nivasee swayan bhagwaan mahavir ke damaad jamaali the; mahavir ko kevalgyaan hone ke 14 varsh pashchaat shravasti main inaki utpatti hui maani jaati he
 Jamali believed that it takes a lot of time to complete a work, it is not complete at one time, so the creation cannot be created
 mahavir kii putree priyadarshana ne pehle to apane pati ke paksh kaa samarthan kiya lekin baad main vah mahavir kii shishyaa ban gai
 Two years later, Tishagupta, a disciple of Acharya Basu, raised a soul dispute in the Rajgriha
 mahavir ke matanusaar aatma sharir ke samast parmaanuon main vyaapt he, lekin tishyagupt kaa kahana tha ki jeev kaa koi ek yaa do pradesh jeev nahin kaha ja saktaa, kisi antim pradesh ko hi jeev kahana chahie
 This is another infidel named Jeeva Pradesh
 phir mahavir-nirvana ke 214 varsh pashchaat avyaktvaadi asadhabhuti acharya hue jinhone setavyanagari main samast jagat ko avyakt pratipaadan karte hue sadhu yaa devayoni main koi bhed sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya
 This is called the third Nihnava named Avyaktism
 iske 6 varsh pashchaat samuchhedwaadi mahagiri ke prashishy or kaundinya ke shishy ashwamitra ne mithila main pratipaadan kiya ki jeev to prati samay nasht hota rahata he, phir punya-paap kaa bhoga koun karegaa? isi ko lekar chauthe nihnav kii sthapana hui
 It was founded 8 years later by Gangacharya, the prachara of Mahagiri and the disciple of Dhanagupta, in Ulukatheer, the fifth Nahnava called Dakarism
 is siddhant ke anusaar sheet or ushn aadi paraspar virdohi bhaavon kaa samvedan sambhav he
 Then, after 544 years of mahavira-nirvana, Rohgupta, a disciple of Shreegupta, accepted the jiva-rashi separately, rendering Triassism in Antranjia
 kuch log mankhali goshaal ko is mat kaa anuyaayi sweekaar karte hai, or kuch vaisheshik darshan ko trirashivaad kaa ang maanate hai
 This is the sixth child
 mahavir-nirvana ke 584 varsh baad abddhvaadi goshtamahil hue jinke matanusaar aatma kaa karm ke saath bandha nahin hota, keval sparsh bhar hota he
 It is the seventh Nihnava that originated in Dashpur
 mahavir bhagwaan ke pashchaat jain sthaviron kii panrapara se pataa lagata he ki acharya bhadrabahu ke samay tak digambar or shwetambar parampara main vishesh matbhed nahin tha
 Around the first century of the year AD, both these traditions were joined
 donon sampradaayon main nimnlikhit mukhya bhed hai-- In the Digambara sect, nudity is said to be the key to salvation, while Shwetambara does not consider nudity necessary for attaining salvation
 digambar stri-mukti kaa nishedh karte hai, shwetambar parampara main 19 wein tirthakar mallinath ko mallikumari ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya he
 Digambara does not consider Agama-texts valid by the Svetambara sect
 digambar sampradaay main sarvajna bhagavan kevalgyani ho jane par kavalaahar nahin karte
 Bhadrabahu in his Kalpasutra has given details of Jain Acharyas
 inke anek gana, kul or shakhaon kaa ullekh yahan miltaa he
 Their names are inscribed in inscriptions of the Kankali mound of Mathura
 digambaron ke sangh Moolsangha - According to Digambarism, in Vikram Samvat 26, the eminent Acharya of Moolsangha divided his union into four branches - Nandisangh, Sensangha, Singhsangha, and Devasangh
 nandisangh ke anuyaayi nandi vriksh ke neeche chaturmaas karte the
 The leader of this association was Maghanandi
 sensangha ke anuyaayi jhaadiyon ke neeche chaturmaas karte the, inke netaa jinsen the
 The followers of Singhsangha used to chaturmas in Singh's caves, their leader was Singh
 devsang ke anuyaayi devadatta naam kii ganika ke ghar main chaturmaas karte the, inke netaa dev the
 There are other strains of these branches which are named after the sadhus, the leaders of the branches
 mulsang kaa sabase pehla ullekh vitho sanjeo 482 ke nonmangal ke ek daanpatr main miltaa he
 Devasena has mentioned Yapani etc
 in his philosophy
 dravid, kaashtha or maathursang ko unhone jainabhas kaha he
 Just as the Chaityavasi or monastic is called 'jati' or 'sripujya' in the White Legends and the Vanvasi is called 'svegi', similarly the Digbaras' kilns should consider the monastic and naked monks as remnants of the Vanvasi branch, though there is a point to be kept in mind
 That, like the Shvetambara sect, there is no mention of any separate organization named Chaityavasi in the Digambara sect
 maaloom hota he, chaityavasi yaa mathvaasi ho jane par bhi digambar sadhu praaia: nagn hi rahete the, lekin aage chalakar unamem vastra dhaaran kane kii pravriti chal padi
 Shrutasagar, a 16th century scholar of Vikram, has written that in Kalikala, Mlechha etc
 is disturbed by seeing the Yatyas in a naked state, so in Mandapadurga, Srivasantakirti Swamy preached that the sages should cover the body with mat, sack etc
 at the time of Charya etc
 The mat etc
 should be removed after the practice
 ye vasantakirti chittod kii gaddi ke bhattarak the or vidru sandru 1264 ke lagbhag vidyaman the
 The followers of these Vasantkirti Bhattaraks were called Beespanthi
 bispanth ke anuyaayi bhattarakon ko apana param guru maanate hai
 There are statues of deities like Kshetrapal and Bhairav in their temples
 in pratimaaon kii kaser se puja hoti he, pushpon se shringaar kiya jaataa he or inpar naivedhy chadhaaya jaataa he
 These Bhattarakas used to own villages and gardens, renovate temples, feed other monks, build dashanas, sit on mattress pillows, walk in palanquins and put a chhatra chavar over them
 kaarkal math ke mahadhipati lalitkirti isi prakaar ke bhattarak the jo 1907 main vidyaman the
 The work done by the scholars of Vidhimarga in the Shvetambara sect to oppose the Chaityavasis, the same work was done by the Digambara sect Thirteen Panth to oppose the Chaityavasi Bhattaraks
 is panth ke anuyaayi pracheen kaal se chale aate hue kathor niyamon ke paalane main dharm maanate hai or van main vaas karanevaale muniyon ko sachcha muni sweekaar karte hai
 In 1626, the pure Amnaya that Pandit Banarsidas preached in Agra later became known as Thirteen Panth
 teraa panth naam jab prachlit ho gaya tab bhattarakon kaa maarg bees panth kaha jane laga
 It should be considered different from the terrestrians of the locals

 The Shvetambaras have two distinctions: idolaters and Sthanakvasi
 shwetambar murtipujakon ko pujera, murtipujak, deravasi athwa mandirmargi bhi kaha jaataa he
 There are differences in the names of the bunches recognized by the Svetambara sect
 anek patrakon main suprasiddh gachhon ke naam bhi nahin paae jate
 These bunches are believed to have started from the time of Udyotan Suri
 kehete hai, udyotan suri ke 84 shishyon ne 84 gachhon kii sthapana kii
 The names of the bunches were amended from time to time
 samast gachhon ke upar ek shripujya hota he; saadhuon ke chaturmaas aadi ke sambandh main vah apana nirnay detaa he, or aavashyaktaa padane par kisi sadhu ko sangh ke baahar kar saktaa he
 The Gachha has an Acharya above the sages, below him Upadhyaya and Panadya below Upadhyaya who takes care of the actions of the Yatyas
 There is a Ganay under the Pannyas, he is a practitioner till the Bhagavatisutra
 jin muniyon kaa mahanishith tak kaa abhyaas hota he ve shravakon ko vrath de sakate hai
 Among the 84 patches, Upkesh, Khatar, Tapa, Pychand, Poonamiya, Anchal and Agamic etc
 are the main patches
 sthankavaasiyon kii samast kriyaayein sthand main hoti hai isaliye ye sthandwasi kahe jate hai
 They are also called bhoosiya, bistola or sage
 ye bhi shwetambar hi hai, lekin murtipuja ko nahin maanate or keval 32 aagmon ko pramaan maanate hai
 Its founder was Lonkashah who used to imitate the scriptures in Ahmedabad
 jain aagmon ke adhyayan se inhen pataa laga ki inamen murtipuja kaa ullekh nahin he, tathaa sabhi aagam pramaan nahin maane ja sakate
 Later in 1467, Lonkashah became a monk
 inhone lonka athwa lumpak sangh chalaaya; bhanji naamak shravak unka pratham ganadhar hua
 Veer's son Loveji tried to improve Lonkamat
 unhone san 1653 main dhundhiya naamak sampradaay chalaaya jo baad main lonkamat kaa hi samarthak hua
 There were many disciples of this sect in Gujarat

 The impact of malaria on the human genome in relation to sickle-cell disease has been studied extensively

 Beta-globin is usually a glutamate amino acid at the sixth place of the protein, while valine acid is replaced in sickle-cell disease
 is badlaav se ek jalsah amino amla ke sthaan par jal-virdohi amla aa jaataa he, jisase haemoglobin ke anu paraspar bandha jane ko protsaahit hote hai
 Deformed red blood cells take the shape of the sickle as hemoglobin molecules become strands
 is tarah se vikrut hui rakt koshikaaye, mukhyatah tilli main, rakt se hataa lee jaati hai or vinasht kar di jaati hai
 When the malaria parasite stays in the red blood cell in its non-sterile state, it changes the internal chemical structure of the red blood cell by its anabolic

 Thus, people who have only one gene of sickle-cell, they suffer from mild anemia due to limited number of sickle-cell disease, but they get much better level of resistance from the more deadly disease malaria
 jin logon main purnataya viksit hansiya-koshika rog hota he ve saadharantah yuva avasthaa se pehle hi mrityu ko praapt ho jate hai
 In areas where malaria spreads in epidemic form, sickle-cell genes are found in about 10% of people

 That is why comparison, historical view, interpretation, commentary etc
 entered his criticism

 babu shyaam sundar das ne vichaaratmak tathaa bhavatmak donon hi ek prakaar ke niabandh likhe hai
 There is enough variety in the subject of his essays

 The language of Babu Shyam Sundar Das is pure literary Hindi, in which the corresponding words of Sanskrit are predominant
 bhashaa ke sambandh main unka vichaar tha- 'jab ham videshi bhaavon ke saath videshi shabdon ko grahan karen tab unhen aisa bana len ki unamem se videshipan nikal jaae or ve apane hokar hamaare vyakaran ke niyamon se anushaasit hon
 'therefore, wherever they have used the prevalent words of' Urdu 'in their language, they have removed their character, they have used them by removing the dots under the words pen, drill, law etc
 and changing their pronunciation
 isi prakaar sanskrit ke shabdon kii clishtataa dur kar ke unhen hindi main saral dhang se likhaa he- jaise- kaary ke sthaan par kaary, anjan ke sthaan par anjan
 Babu Shyamsunder Das was of the opinion about the word selection- 'the first place is the words of pure Hindi, behind it the easy and popular words of Sanskrit, behind it the simple and popular words of foreign languages like Persian and behind it the obsolete of Sanskrit
 Let the words be spaced
 farsi aadi videshi bhashaaon ke kathin shabdon kaa prayog kadaapi na ho
 Babu Shyam Sundar Das has written mainly in two types of styles - 1
 vichaaratmak style- vichaaratmak style main vichaaratmak niabandh likhe gaye hai
 The sentences in this style are short and expressive
 bhashaa sabal, saral or pravahamayi he
 For example- 'gopiyo kaa sneh badhaya he
 They are compiled with Krishna in Ras Leela
 anek utsav manaati he
 This behavior of Premmayi gopikas is very delightful
 usamen kahin se aswabhaaviktaa nahin aa saki
 2
 Exploratory Style - The explanatory style is used in exploratory essays
 inamen vaakya apekshaakrit kuch lambey hai
 There is a plethora of corresponding words in the language
 vishay kii gahanta tathaa shushkta ke kaaran yah style main kuch shushk or rahit he
 See an example of this type of style- 'yah jivan-sangram do bhinn sabhyataaon ke sangharshan se or bhi teevr or dukhamay prathit hone laga he
 According to this condition, when literature is generated and encouraging the brain of the society, then only the signs of real progress will be seen and its welfare will give the country the glory of modern times
 babu shyaam sundardaas kii kisi prakaar kii style main alankaaron kii sajaavat nahin pai jaati
 Sayings and idioms have been used sparingly
 apane vichaaron ko bhalee prakaar samajhane ke liye babu shyaam sundar das ne ek hi baat ko 'saransh yah he' 'athwa', 'jaise' aadi shabdon ke saath baar-baar duharaaya he
 In Hindi literature, Babu Shyam Sundar Das has been replaced as his Hindi promoter and Hindi director

 Ramchandra Shukla has written in the history of Hindi literature: shyaam sundar das na keval santhaan-nirmaataa the, balki prabandh-kala main bhi bejod the
 He worked determinedly to overcome the shortages of all areas of literature
 bhashaa tatvavetta ke rup main yaa siddhanton ke vyaakhyaata rup main unheen kii uplabdhiyon ke kaaran saahityalochan hindi ke vidhyaarthiyon kaa bahut samay tak kanthhaar bana rahaa
 In his mind, the notion remained that the basis of the theoretical review of Hindi should be made by combining Sanskrit and Western criticism-principles and with a special harmony
 shyaam sundar das se pehle hindi or nagari lipi ke liye vishesh rup se sankatpurna samay tha
 Pratap Narayan Mishra had established meetings for the promotion of Hindi in many places
 aisi hi ek sabha 1884 main ‘hindi uddharini pratinidhi madhya bharat sabha’ ke naam se prayag main pratishthit kii gayi
 Bharatendu Harishchandra also ventured several times for Nagari's entry into government offices, but he could not succeed

 is sahitya-sankat ke atirikt nagari kaa pravesh sarkari dacrataron main na hone se nagari jaanane vaali janata ke saamne ghor sankat tha
 In the same period, Kashi Nagari Pracharini Sabha was established in 1893 from the industry of some enthusiastic students, among whom Babu Shyam Sundar Das was the chief
 yahan bhi ramchandra shukla kaa kathan yaad rakhana chahie ki, ‘sach puuchhie to is sabha kii sari samruddhi or kirti babu shyaam sundar das ke tyaag or satat parishram kaa fal he
 They continued to do it from the beginning till the end and kept it ready in many big industries

 The Nagari Prachar movement created new enthusiasm among Hindi-lovers and many people became devoted to the growth of literature

 The Constitution of Pakistan was passed by the Constituent Assembly on 10 April 1973 and came into effect from 14 August 1973
 is kaa praaroop zulfiqaar ali bhutto kii sarkaar or vipaksh ne mil kar taiyaar kiya
 This is the third practice of Pakistan and many changes have been made in it
 1950 main bharat main samvidhan ke parvartan ke baad, pakistan ke saansadon ne apane samvidhan ko gathit karne ke prayaas tej kar die
 Prime Minister Mohammad Ali and his government officials worked with the support of opposition parties in the country to prepare a constitution for Pakistan
 ant main, is sanyukt kaary ke kaaran, samvidhan ke pehle samoocchy ko lagu kiya gaya
 The incident took place on 23 March 1956, to this day still celebrates Republic Day on the occasion of the enforcement of the Constitution of Pakistan
 is samvidhan ne pakistan ko "ekasadaneey vidhayika" ke saath sarkaar kii sansadeey pranali pradaan kii
 Also, it officially declared Pakistan an Islamic republic
 iske alaava, isamen, samta ke siddhant ko bhi pehali baar pesh kiya gaya tha
 By constitution, Iskandar Mirza assumed the office of president, but due to his continued unconstitutional involvement in national affairs, the four elected Prime Ministers were dismissed in just two years
 janata ke dabaav ke tahat, raashtrapati iskundar mirza ne 1958 main takhtapalat ko vaid tehraaya; or is prakaar yah samvidhan lagbhag nilambit ho gaya
 Shortly afterwards General Ayub Khan deposed Iskandar Mirza and declared himself President
 or isliye is yah samvidhan keval 3 saal ke liye hi chal paaya
 On 17 February 1960, Ayub Khan appointed a commission to report on the future political structure of the country
 ayog pakistan ke purv mukhya nyaayadhish, mohammad shahabuddin kii adhyakshata main das anya sadasyon ke saath gathit kii gai thi
 It had five members from East Pakistan and five from West Pakistan
 yah purnatah sevanivrutt nyaayadhishon, vakeelon, udyogpatiyon or jameendaaron se bana tha
 The report of this Constitution Commission was presented to President Ayub on 6 May 1961 and after an investigation by the President and his Cabinet, in January 1962, the Cabinet finally approved the original text of the new Constitution
 ise raashtrapati ayub dwaara 1 march 1962 ko lagu kiya gaya tha or ant main 8 june 1962 ko yah prabhaav main aayaa
 This constitution contained 250 articles divided into twelve parts and three programs
 pichley samvidhan kii tarah hi isamen bhi pakistan ko islamic mulyon par banane kii baat kii gai thi or ekasadaneey vidhayika ko tathst rakhaa gaya tha
 But according to the projects of this constitution, as compared to the constitution of 1956, the President of Pakistan was given many rights, and basically a presidential system was formed
