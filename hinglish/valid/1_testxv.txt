jab se england ne scotland par qabza karke uskaa british samrajya main vilay kar liya tab se scotland main vidroh kii bhaavana chalati rahi he - jo kabhi madhyam ho jaati he or kabhi teevr
 The presence of Skun's stone in London was considered by many Scots to be a symbol of their slavery
 isliye san 1996 main in scoti bhaawanaaon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue angrezi sarkaar ne faisla kiya ke skin kaa pathar scotland main rakhaa jayega or landan tabhi laayaa jayega jab kisi nae maharaj yaa maharani kaa rajbhishek hona ho
 Ledger or ledger is the main book in which the transactions of money are kept accountable
 aajkal yah computer-file ke rup main bhi hoti he
 All the transactions in the ledger are written according to the account in which there are two separate columns of debited and credited
 lekhankan kaa ek uddeshy sugamawa se yah nishchit karnaa he vyapaaree ko apane lendaaron ko kya dena he, use apane dendaaron se kya lenaa he, uske vyay or aay kay he ityadi
 It is also clear that this information cannot be obtained immediately just by writing the deals in the journal
 mana ki ek vyakti yah jaananaa chahta he ki use 'k' se kya lenaa athwa dena he to use 'k' se sambandhit pravishtiyon ko dhundhane ke liye puraa rojnaamachaa dekhnaa padegaa kyonki usne usase kai baar maal kharida hoga or kai baar use dhan diya hoga
 If this method is used to identify your position with each person or firm dealing with them, then the purpose of writing the same account will be finally achieved
 iske atirikt iskaa arth hoga samay, urja, evam dhan kii vyarth barwaadi
 Therefore, any quick means should be obtained to write all the entries related to each individual or firm
 yah sab pravishtiyon ko ek or pustak main, jise khatabahi kehete hai, ekatrit or sankshipt karke kiya jaataa he
 All the entries related to each person which till now were scattered in the Roznamcha are collected and abridged at one place
 bottleboy ke anusaar khatabahi khaaton kii mukhya pustak he or isi pustak main saare vyapaarik len-dein ant main vibhajit hokar apane-apane khaaton main sthaan praapt karte hai
 According to Peakles, 'account is the most important book of accounts and is the floor of entries made in subsidiary books
 yah anivarytah teen prakaar ke khaaton kaa sangrah he - vaastavik, vyaktigat tathaa nammaatr 
 From the above discussion, it is completely clear that the account is not a book of the first entry because no entry is made directly in this introduction
 pravishti sarvapratham sahaayak pustakon main kii jaati he
 It is a book of major importance
 isamen vayavhaar main hone vaale sab saudon se sambandhit khate hote hai
 Although there is no such definite rule, generally one page of a ledger contains only one account
 aisa ashuddhiyon evam puri likhaawat ke bhaddepan ko dur karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 If the number of accounts is very large then it may not be possible to keep all the accounts in one account
 aisi dasha main bahi ko kai vibhaagon athwa parinaamon main vibhajit kar diya jaataa he
 For example, cash book is a subdivision of ledger
 isamen rokad ke saude likhe jate hai
 One way to divide a ledger is to divide it into personal and non-personal or ordinary ledger
 vyaktigat khatabahi ko aage vikray khatabahi ke khate main upavibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 Similarly Khatabahi can also be subdivided into actual Khatabhi and nominal Khatabhi
 kabhi-kabhi puunji khaataa or aaharan khaataa rakhane ke liye nijee khatabahi rakhi jaati he
 But no such account is maintained in the company
 yah note kiya janaa chahie ki khatabahi ko upavibhajit karne kii keval akeli uparokt vidhi hi nahin he
 The methods of dividing depend on the circumstances of each
 prayek khatabahi ke armbh main abhisuchak hota he
 Normally, it is descriptive indicative
 abhisuchak kaa ek prishth varnmaala ke ek akshar ke liye niyat kar diya jaataa he or jo naam jis akshar se armbh hote hai ve us akshar ke liye niyat prishth par likh die jate hai
 In the indicator, the number of the page on which the account is opened is written in front of each account
 vyapaar main khatabahi ke kai praaroop milte hai
 The common format consists of columns for date, transaction details, endorsements and funds
 vyapaarik aavashyaktaaon ke anuroop atirikt ghan-raashi stambh jode ja sakate hai
 An alternate form of format, known among banks and some business entities, is one whose entire page of the ledger is divided into six columns
 ye stambh hai - The advantage of this alternative format is that the balance of the account can be withdrawn automatically after each transaction, there is no need to wait till the end of the year to find the balance
 rojnaama evam anya sahaayak pustako se khatabahi main pravishtiyaan karne kii prakriya ko khatauni kaha jaataa he
 It forms the basis for entries given in the Roznamche and other supporting books
 khatauni ke kaary ke liye vishesh kushalta kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti kyonki yah saamaanya prakaar kaa kaary he
 The entries should be noted in the account after writing in the journal
 anya sahaayak pustkon kii khatauni se rojnaama kii khatauni aasaan he
 The amount written in the debit side of the debit side of the journal is deposited in the credit side of the account in the ledger and the amount written in the credit side's money column is deposited in the ledger's credit side
 khatabahi ke vivaran stambh main khaaton ke naam adal-badal kar die jate hai - rojnaama ke us khate kaa naam jisamen ki dhan-raashi debit kii gai he
 The statement of credit side of the second account will be written in the account column
 isi prakaar se iskaa vipareet bhi sahi he
 This can be understood by the following example
 khatabahi main prayek lender kaa ek alag khaataa kholaa jaataa he
 The amount of each purchase will be credited to the respective personal account, usually daily
 is pustak kii dwi-pravishti kul krayon kaa aavadhik yoga ke kray khate main debit karne se purna hogi
 Each debtor has to open a separate account in the account book
 saadharantaya udhaar bikri ko vaiyakti khate main pratidin khataya jaataa he
 The individual account of the customers will be debited from the sale amount
 vikray khaataa udhaar bikri ke masik yoga se credit kiya jayega
 Thus the double-entry of this book will be completed
 khaatabahi main us prayek vyakti, jise maal lautaaya gaya he, ko ‘debit kiya jaataa he or maheene ke ant main vapasiyon ke aavadhik yoga ko khatabahi main kray vaapasi khate main credit kiya jaataa he
 Each customer who returns the goods is credited and at the end of the month the sales-back account of the sum of the sales-return book is debited
 rokad kii sabhi madon ko khatabahi main khatabahi main khataya jaataa he
 All the receipts written in the debit side of the cash book are deposited in the credit of the respective accounts by writing 'from cash', 'from bank', 'from discount'
 rokad bahi ke credit paksh main likhe gayi sabhi bhugtanon ko sambandhit khaaton ke debit main ‘rocked se’, ‘chhot se’, bank se’ likhakar khataya jaataa he
 The sum of the debit side of the debit side of the cash book is written on the debit side of the rebate account in the ledger
 kyonki maden vyaktigat khaaton ke credit paksh main khatai jaati he
 The sum of the rebate column of the credit side of the cash book is written to the credit side of the rebate account in the account due to the item being debited to the individual accounts
 us vyakti, jisase vinamay-vipatr mila he, kaa khaataa vipatr kii dhan-raashi se credit kar diya jaataa he
 The receivable-exchange-bills account is debited in the ledger from the monthly totals of the bills received
 us vyakti, jisko vipatr diya jaataa he, kaa khaataa vipatr kii dhan-raashi se debit kiya he
 The Exchange Bills Account payable in the ledger is credited by the monthly totals of the bills due
 aavadhik interval par khudara rokad bahi ke vaishleshak stambhon dwaara darshaae gaye khudara vyayon ke vishleshan kii general pravishti kii jaati he
 Each nominal account is debited by its respective totals and is credited with the total retail expenses incurred during the retail cash account period
 yah pataa lagane ke liye ki ek vishesh vyakti se kya lenaa he yaa ek vishesh vyakti ko kya dena he, uske vyaktigat khate kaa shesh nikaalnaa aavashyak he
 This process is called closing of accounts
 ek khate kaa shesh nikaalane ke liye uske donon pakshon kaa yoga lagaaya jaataa he
 If both sides are not equal, then the two sides are written on the side lacking the difference to make them equal
 kami vaale paksh main likhane ke liye jo antar is prakaar praapt kiya jaataa he use us khate kaa shesh kehete hai
 If the sum of the debit side is more than the sum of the credit side, the balance is written as “SHTHAL THANDSANDBAM” and written to the credit side
 aisi dasha main us shesh ko debit shesh kaha jaataa he
 At the beginning of the second year, the balance is written to the debit side after writing the account name at the time of opening the account
 isi prakaar se yadi credit paksh kaa yoga debit paksh ke yoga se adhik he to shesh ko shthal insandbam idhakashlikhakar credit paksh main likh diya jaataa he
 This balance is called credit balance
 vaastavik khate vyapaar kii sampattiyon ko darshaate hai
 The balances of these accounts are extracted on the date of the letter to find the amount of the assets of the right to trade
 inkaa shesh bhi usee prakaar nikaala jaataa he
 Just as the balance of individual accounts is drawn
 yah note kiya janaa chahie ki vaastavik khaaton kaa shesh hameshaa debit hi hota he yaa koi shesh nahin hota arthath unka shesh kabhi bhi credit shesh nahin ho saktaa
 Nominal accounts are related to business expenses, losses, income and profits
 inkaa shesh nahin nikaala jaataa he
 In fact, they are closed by transferring them to business account or profit and loss account
 tippanee While taking out the balance of the accounts or closing it, it should be kept in mind that the joint of the two sides should be written in a straight line
 yadi khaaton main keval ek hi pravishti he to jod lagaana anaavashyak he
 The double line drawn below the entry will mean that the entry is its own joint
 isi prakaar yadi ek khate kii donon ore samaan dhan-raashi vaali ek-ek pravisht he to bhi jod lagaana anaavashyak hoga
 994 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 994 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 It is considered a collective year based on the Julian calendar
 adhikansh vishwa main isi paddati ke aadhaar par puraane varshon kii gananaa kii jaati he
 In India, there are many famous Panchagas like Vikram Samvat which begins 57 or 58 years before the birth of Jesus
 iske alaava shaq samvath bhi prasiddh he
 Shaka Samvat is the ancient era of India which begins 78 years after the birth of Jesus
 shaq samvath bharat kaa rashtriya calendar he
 Some other ancient era prevalent in India are as follows- uparokt antar ke aadhaar par 994 isa purv ke anusaar vikrami samvath, saptarshi samvath, kaliyug samvath or pracheen saptarshi aadi main varsh aadi nikaale ja sakate hai

 hindi bhashaa ke prasar, pathakon ke ruchi parishkar or gyanavardhan ke liye dvivedi ji ne vividh vishyon par anek niabandh likhe
 Dwivedi ji essays can be divided into eight parts from the point of view - literature, life, science, history, geography, industry, craft language, spirituality
 dvivedi ji ne aalochanatmak nibandhon kii bhi rachana kii
 Like the Sanskrit commentators in the field of criticism, he analyzed the merits of the works and adopted the method of refutation
 dvivedi ji saral or subodh bhashaa likhane ke pakshpaati the
 He himself adopted the simple and popular language
 unki bhashaa main na to sanskrit ke tatsam shabdon kii adhikta he or na urdu-farsi ke aprachlit shabdon kii bharmaar he ve grih ke sthaan par ghar or ucch ke sthaan par unchaa likhnaa adhik pasand karte the
 Dwivedi used Urdu and Persian words in his language without any hesitation, but in this experiment he adopted only the prevalent words
 dvivedi ji kii bhashaa kaa rup purnatah sthit he
 She is pure refined and bound by the rules of grammar
 unka vaakya-vinyas hindi ko prakruti ke anuroop he kahin bhi vah angrezi yaa urdu ke dhang kaa nahin
 There are mainly three forms of Dwivedi's style - dvivedi ji ne naye-naye vishyon par lekhnee chalaai
 As the subject was new and preliminary, Dwivedi introduced him in a simple and comprehensible style
 aise vishyon par lekh likhte samay dvivedi ji ne ek shikshak kii bhaanti ek baat ko kai baar duharaaya he taaki pathakon kii samaj main vah bhalee prakaar aa jaae
 Thus the style of the articles is the introductory style

 Writing in this style, he gave a mocking reply to the opponents
 yah style ospurn he
 It has fluency and its language is serious
 kahin-kahin yah style ospurn na hokar vyangyatmak ho jaati he
 At such places, there is fainting in words and simplicity in sentences
 'is municipality ke chairman shriman boochaa shah hai
 Millions of rupees of Father Dad's earnings have filled your house
 padhe-likhe aap ram kaa naam hai
 You have been the chairman just because by showing your car to the government, you become brave and remain surrounded by eighty-four sixty-four people
 ' Dwivedi ji has adopted this style in discussing serious literary subjects
 is style ke bhi do rup milte hai
 The first form is found in those articles which have been written to convince the public about a controversial topic
 isamen vaakya chote-chote hai
 Language is simple
 doosraa rup un lekhon main paaya jaataa he jo vidwaanon ko sambodhit kar likhe gaye hai
 The sentences in it are relatively long
 bhashaa kuch clisht he
 for example - hindi sahitya kii seva karne waalon main dvivedi ji kaa vishesh sthaan he
 It is due to Dwivedi ji's unique literature-services that his time is called as Dwivedi era

 Any additional arrangement that is made to maintain the output or phase variables of a system is called the control system
 jis mul tantra ke output ko niyantrit karnaa hota he, use sanyantr yaa niyantrit tantra kehete hai
 The control system constantly monitors the output or state variables of the plant and changes the output of the plant in such a way that the output remains the same or changes as desired

 The Sopani control system consists of more than one loop
 isamen niyantran char ke niyantran ke liye na keval ise hi mapa jaataa he balki kisi anya char ko bhi mapa jaataa he
 The outer loop, instead of directly controlling the control variable, provides a set-point for the inner loop that ultimately controls the primary variable through the process
 sopani niyantran chunane kaa mukhya kaaran yah hota he ki isse niyantran karne main kathin tantra do bhaagon main bant jaataa he or mukhya disterbens ko gherte hue ek dwitiyak niyantran loop bana diya jaataa he
 Thus the secondary loop removes most of the disturbances, so the main loop has to control only the small disturbances
 'sheeghra soochna safalataa kaa aadhaar he' - yahi sopani niyantran kaa bhi aadhaar he
 Sopani control is most beneficial where the inner closed loop covers all the disturbances and delays of the second order so that only the 'big lag' is included in the primary loop

 Magnetic field is the magnetic effect of electric currents and magnetic materials

 The Banaras Gharana is one of the six famous Gharanas of Indian tabla playing
 ye gharaana 200 varshon se kuch pehle khyatipraapt pandit ram sahay ke prayaason se viksit hua tha
 Pandit Ram Sahay started playing tabla with his father at the age of five
 9 varsh kii aayu main ye lakhanu aa gayi evam lakhanu gharaane ke modhu khan ke shishy ban gayi
 When Ram Sahay was only 17 years old, the new Nawab of Lucknow asked Modhu Khan if Ram Sahay could do a demonstration for him
 It is said that Ram Sahay played tabla continuously for 7 nights, which was praised by the whole society and he received rains
 apni is pratibha pradarshan ke baad ram sahay banaras waapas aa gayi
 After some time Ram Sahai felt the need for some change in the traditional tabla playing
 agle chah maah tak ye ekantavasi ho gayi or is ekantavaas kaa parinaam saamne aayaa, jise aaj banaras-baj kehete hai
 This is the typical tabla playing style of the Banaras Gharana
 is nayi vaadan style ke peeche pramukh uddeshy tha ki ye ekal vaadan ke liye bhi upyukt thi or kisi anya sangeet vaadya yaa nrity ke liye sangat bhi de sakati thi
 In this, the tabla can also be delicate, as is needed for Khayal and can also be played at a rapid pace for the accompaniment of Dhrupad or Kathak dance style like Pakhawaj
 ram sahay ne tabalaa vaadan main anguli kii thap kaa nayaa tarika khoja, jo visheshkar naa kii taal ke liye mahatvapurn tha
 In this, turning the finger in the right can produce maximum resonance vibration
 inhone tatkaaleen sangyojan praroopon jaise jaise gat, tukdaa, paraan, aadi se bhi vibhinn sangyojan kiye, jinamein uthaan, banarsi theka or fard pramukh hai
 Today the Banarasi tabla gharana is famous for its powerful form, although the Banaras gharana players are also capable of playing light and soft tones
 gharaane ko purvi baj me vargeekrut kiya gaya he, jisamen lakhanu, farrukhabad or banaras gharaane aate hai
 The Banaras style uses more resonant thapas of tabla, such as na and dhin
 banaras vadak adhimaanya rup se puure haath se thai-thai thap dete hai, bajaay ek anguli se dene ke; jaise ki dilli style main dete hai
 As such, both the Thaps have been integrated in the Banaras Baz style

 a significant break from the concept of the constant typological class or type in biology came with the theory of evolution through natural selection, formulated by Charles Darwin in the context of extreme populations
 thomas robert malths dwaara jansankhya ke siddhant par ek niabandh se aanshik rup se prabhavit, darwin ne kaha ki jansankhya vruddhi se "astitv ke liye sangharsh" ho saktaa he jisamen anukool bhinnata prabal ho jaati he kyonki anya kii mrityu ho jaati he

 Darwin developed the theory of "natural selection" from 1838 onwards and began writing his "big book" on the subject when Alfred Russell Wallace sent him a version of the same theory in about 1858
 unke alag-alag patr 1858 kii baithak main ek saath prastut kiye gaye the landan socity of landan kii
 In late 1859, Darwin's publication of his "essence" as On the Origin of Spastis explained natural selection in detail and in a way that led to an increasingly widespread acceptance of Darwin's concepts of evolution at the expense of alternative theories
 thomas henry huxley ne manushyon ke liye darwin ke vichaaron ko lagu kiya, peleotology or tulanaatmak sharir rachana ke prayog se thos pramaan pradaan karne ke liye ki insaanon or apis ne ek aam vansh ko saajha kiya
 Some people were troubled by this because it was implied that humans had no special place in the universe

 In this direction, Darwin developed his own temporal theory of pangenesis
 1865 main, grager mendal ne bataaya ki tatwon ko swatantra vargeekaran or pruthakkaran tatwon ke madhyam se ek anumaanit tareeke se viraasat main mila
 Mandal's laws of inheritance eventually fulfilled Darwin's most pangensis theory

 The complete set of unique traits that make up the structure and behavior of an organism is called a phenotype
 These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment
 natijatan, ek jeev ke phenotype ke kai pahaluon ko viraasat main nahin miltaa he
 For example, there is an interplay between a person's genotype and sunlight; Thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children
 However, due to differences in genotypic variation some people can tan more easily than others; a striking example, are those who are the inherited qualities of bbinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn

 DNA sequences can be altered through mutations, creating new alleles
 yadi ek jin ke bheetar ek utparivartan hota he, to nae elil ko prabhavit kar sakate hai ki jin ke niyantran, jeev ke phenotip ko badalte hai
 However, while in some cases this simple correspondence between alleles and a trait, most traits are more complex and quantitative properties are controlled by loci

 If each individual were to contribute the same number of offspring, the sexual population remains the same size as each generation, where the reproductive population doubles in size for each generation
 sex kii do guna laagat pehle jon menard smith dwaara varnit thi
 The first cost is that only one of the two sexes may be young in a sexually mature species
 
 The second cost is that anyone who reproduces sexually can only give 50% of the genes to any different offspring, along with every new generation

 Different traits provide different rates of survival and reproduction
 in lakshanon ko peedi se peedi tak paarit kiya ja saktaa he
 More offspring can be produced than survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction
 natijatan, un gunon ke saath jeevashm jo unhen apane pratidwandviyon par ek laabh de dete hai, unke gunon ko agali peedi tak un gunon ke saath paarit karne kii sambhaavna he jo ek laabh pradaan nahin karte hai

 swasthya ko jivit rahane or punarutpaadan karne kii kshamta ke dwaara mapa jaataa he, jo agali peedi main iske anuvanshik yogadan kaa aakaar nirdhaarit karata he
 However, fitness is not the same as the total number of offspring: fitness is instead indicated by the proportion of later generations that carry the genes of an organism
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi koi jeev acchhee tarah se jivit rah saktaa he or tezi se prajnan kar saktaa he, lekin uske vanshaj bahut chote or jivit rahane ke liye kamjor the, is jeev main bhavishya kii pidiyon main thodaa anuvaanshik yogadan hoga or is prakaar kam fitness hoga
 If alleles increase fitness more than other alleles of that gene, then this allele will become more common within the population with each generation
 in lakshanon ko "ke liye chaynit" kaha jaataa he
 Examples of symptoms that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased fertility
 Conversely, this allele has less beneficial or harmful allyl consequences resulting in reduced fitness - these have been selected against "
 " mahatvapurn baat, elil kii fitness ek nishchit visheshta nahin he; agar paryaavaran main parivartan, pehle tatasth yaa hanikaarak lakshan phydemand ho sakate hai or pehle laabhakaari gun hanikaarak ho jate hai
 However, even if the direction of selection is reversed in this way, symptoms lost in the past may not re-develop into a uniform form
 ek visheshta ke liye aabaadi ke bheetar prakritik chayan, jo vibhinn prakaar ke mulyon jaise oonchai par bhinn ho sakate hai, ko teen alag-alag prakaaron main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he pehla dishaatmak chayan hota he, jo ki samay ke saath ek vishesh gun ke ausat mulya main badlaav hota he- udhaaharan ke liye, jeev dhire-dhire oonche ho jate hai
 Second, disruptive selection is selection for highly trait values and often becomes the most common of the two different values, with selection against the mean value
 yah tab hoga jab yaa to laghu yaa ucch jeevon kaa ek phayda hota he, lekin madhyam oonchai ke nahin hote ant main, chayan ko sthir karne main donon ore donon ore ke charam vishesh gunon ke bich chayan hota he, jo ausat mulya or kam vividhta ke aas-paas bhinnata ko kam karata he
 This, for example, causes organisms to gradually become all the same height

 This survival loss is balanced by high reproductive success in men who show these difficult-to-fake, sexually selected traits
 natural sellection sabase aam taur par swabhaav ko maapta he jiske khilaaf vyaktiyon or vyaktigat gunon ko jivit rahane kii adhik sambhaavna he
 In this sense "nature" refers to an ecosystem, namely a system in which organisms interact with all other elements in their local environment, both physically and biologically

 The stories of Alice Ekka are the only compilation of the stories of the first female tribal narrator Alice Ekka in Hindi
 hindi katha sahitya ke gyaat itihaas main elice ekka se purv kisi adivasee mahila kahanikar kaa zikr nahin miltaa
 In undivided bihar-jharkhand, fiction writing begins with Alice Ekka's stories in the forties
 ‘elice ekka kii kahaniyaan’ sankalan main sankalan main elice kii kul chah kahaniyaan shaamil hai
 'vanakanya', 'durga's children and Elma's fantasies', 'salgi, Jugni and Amba Gach', 'koyal's Ladli Sumari', 'fifteen August, Bilcho and Ramu' and 'dharti Lahlhegi, Jhalo Nachegi will sing'
 saath hi isamen khalil jibran kii paanch anudit kahaniyaan bhi shaamil hai
 According to Vandana Tete, editor of 'alice Ekka's Stories',' Her first attainable work, which is a translation of Khalil Gibran's literature, appeared in the August 1959 issue of 'adivasi'
 ’ 


 ‘or ‘pehali kahani ‘adivasee’ ke 17 agast 1961, varsh 15, ank 28-29 main chhapi he
 Which is titled 'vanakanya'
 ’ shrimati tete ke anusaar sambhav he iske purv bhi unki rachanaaen chhapi hon parantu tatkaaleen patr-patrikaon kii anuplabdhta ke kaaran is sambandh main nishchit rup se kuch bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The stories of Alice Ekka are of the opinion of litterateurs and critics - 'when the life and experience of tribal society comes as a saying, we are familiar with a new philosophy
 yah darshan sashastitv or sahjivita kaa he jo elice kii kahaniyon main he or jisaki bunaavat bahut baarik he
 Ellis sets out the tribal hopes of the sixties in his losses
 lekin baad main ve us chal ko bhi abhivyakt karti hai jiskaa shikaar adivasee samaaj banataa he
 ' sameekshak amarendra yadav ke anusaar- ‘kahaniyaan bahut badi nahin hai, par in chote-chote kisson main kahi gai baton ke myne zarur behad gahare hai
 These stories, written by keeping nature and woman at the center, get into the heart of the reader slowly
 lekhika ne jitna mahatv insaani bhaawanaaon ko diya he, utani hi mustaidi se ped-paudhe, pakshi, jaanavar, nadi, akaash, jangal, chattan aadi bhi in kathaon main apni sahaj upasthiti darj karaate hai
 ' aalochak da
 savitri badaik kii tippanee he- ‘kisi bhi kshetra ke samudaay kii pahchaan uski bhashaa or samskruti se hoti he
 The language of Alice's stories is tribal Hindi
 ve nagpuri, magahi, khortha, bhashaaon kaa bhi prayog sanvaadon main karti he
 But there is simplicity in dialogues
 saadhaaran log saral bhashaa kaa hi prayog karte hai
 


 Alice Ekka takes note of the basic trends and values of tribal society in her stories
 unki katha nayikaaye apane aatmanirnay ke adhikaar or pahchaan ke liye nirantar sangharsh karti hai
 Equality, coexistence, participation, collectivity, loyalty to labor, equality of sex between men and women are the hallmarks of Alice Ekka's stories
 ’ According to the novelist Vinod Kumar, 'tribal society does not have the same tendency towards prose writing, but it was only in the sixties that Ellis Ekka was writing tedious stories
 unhone samaaj or parivesh ko apni choti kahaniyon main sametane kaa kathin kaary kiya he
 His stories show the joys, sorrows, joy and optimism of the future of tribal society
 dow
 maaya prasad maanati hai elice ekka ne apane samaaj ko kahaniyon ke dwaara logon tak pahunchane kaa bidaa uthaaya tha
 At the same time, Father Peter Paul says, 'alice Ekka's stories are stories of experiences that bring comfort to the heart
 ’ Literature readers and critics agree that Ellis Ekka's writing is a wonderful feature of the tribal Kahan tradition in Hindi literature
 jo unhen hindi katha sahitya main unke adivasaipan ke kaaran vishisht banaati he
 Ellis's stories underline the intimate relationship between humans and nature in accordance with tribal biography and also alert us to the breakdown in this relationship
 varisht adivasee patrkaar or sahityakar shishir tudu kaa mat he, 'is pustak se adivasee darshan ke bare main pataa chalata he
 It is outside the mainstream
 adivasee darshan se hi duniya bachegi
 Today, the fierce wind of competition and development is blowing, it is a threat to the creation itself
 mukhya dhara ke darshan main manushya shreshth he jabaki adivasee darshan main vah ek ikai he
 Just like there is a mountain, there is a waterfall, so is a human being
 adivasee darshan or sahitya kii pairokaar vandana tete pustak kii bhoomika main likhti hai, ‘beshak! elice bahut hi ‘maamuli’ kathakaar he
 Magic beyond reality and beyond the claim of any miracle
 unki kahaniyon main prakruti he, samaaj he, sangeet he, jivan kii lay he or bahari tathaa bhitari samaaj ke ghaat-pratighaat bhi hai
